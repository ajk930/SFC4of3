Legislation to Support the Exlsling
Gold Standard â More Power Urged
for Secretary of Treasury.
Â«>O*o<>O-S O*- OtOfO <i O<? O^O-f.n â¢'â 
The San Francisco Call
with respect, to cash on hand, and the 1
favorable showing made by the revenues i
have made it possible for the Secretary ,
of the Treasury to take action under the i
provisions of section &24. Revised Stat â¢
utes. relating to the sinking fund. Re- ,
celpts exceeded expenditures for thÂ« first
five months of the current fiscal year by
m.4i3.;.53 si. and. as mentioned above, the j
Secretary of the Treasury estimates that
there will be a surplus of approximately
J40.000.0iT0 at .he end of the year.
Under such conditions It was deemed ad
visable and proper to resume compliance
with the provision* of the sinking fund
law. which for eight years has not been
done because of deficiencies in the rev
enues. Tne Treasury Department, there
fore, offered to purchase during Novem
ber J25.f"in.000 of the 5 per cent loan of
ISM. or the 4 per cent funded loan of IM7,
at the current market price. The amount
offered ajid purchased during November
was $lM f| S.6<y>. The premium paid by the
Government on such purchases was
?2.2.^,r.21 and the net saving in interest
was about J2.R55.f00. The success of this
operation was sufficient to induce the
Government to continue the offer to pur
chase bonds to and including the 23d day
<>( December. Instant, unless the remain
der of the J25.0f>0.000 called for should bo
presented in the meantime for redemp
tion.
Increased activity in industry with its
welcome attendantâ â  larger employment
for labor at higher wagesâ gives to thÂ«
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium. It is fur-
ther true that year by
year, with larpcr areas
"f land under cultiva
tion, the increasing vol
ume of agricultural pro
ducts, cotton, corn and
wheat, rails for a
Inrpor volume of money
supply. This Is espe
cially noticeable at the
crop harvesting and
crop moving period.
In Its earlier history
thÂ« national bankinÃ
act seemed to prove a
rea sona b1 Â« avenu*
through which needful
additions to the circu
lation could from time
to time be made.
Changing conditions have apparently ren
i dered it now inoperative to that end. The
â¢ high margin in bond securities required
resulting from large premiums which
Government bonds command In the mar
ket, or the tax on note issues, or both
operating together, appear to be the In
fluences which Impair It? public utility.
i The attention of Congress Is respect
fully, invited to this important matter
. with the view of ascertaining whether or
, not such reasonable modifications can M
. made in the national banking act as
I will render Its service In the particulars
here referred to more responsive to the
i people's needs. I again urge that na
* tional banks be authorized to organize
with â  capital of J25.000.
I urgently recommend
that to support th. *>x-
I Ist Ing gold standard
; and to maintain "the
. parity in vaJue of the
â  coins of the two metal*
, (gold and silver* and
the equal power of cv
. cry dollar at all times
, In the market and In
. the payment of debts,"
. the Secretary of the
. Treasury be given ad-
I dltinnal power and
charged with the duty
] to sell I'nited States
i bonds and to employ
such other effective
means as may be nec
i cssary to these ends.
Th<Â» authority should include the power to
anthorlty should include the power to
Mil bond* on long and short time, as
conditions may require, and should pro
vi.lt, for a rate of interest lower than
that fixed by the act of January 11 1Â«75.

the prÂ»srnt as 'he mo* W- Hiring time to
make adequate provision to insure the
continuance of the gold standard and of
public confidence in the ability and pur
pose of the Government to meet all its
obligations In the money which the civil
ised world recognizes as the best. The
financial transactions of the Government
are conducted upon a gold basis. We re
ceive gold when wo sell United States
bonds and u>e gold for tho'r payment.
We are maintaining the parity of all tho
money Issued or coined by authority of
the Government. We are doing these
things with the means at hand. Happily,
at the present time, we are not compelled
to resort to loans to supply gold. It has
boon done in the past. however, and may
have to he done in the future. It be
hooves us therefore to provide at once
the best means tO meet thÂ« emergency
when it arises, and the best means are.
those which are the most certain and
economical. Those now authorized have
the virtue neither of directness nor econ
omy. We have already eliminated ono
of the causes of our financial plight and
embarrassment during the years _ 1R93.
1894, -:i5 and ISM. Oar receipts now
equal our expenditures: deficient reven
ues no longer create alarm. I^et us"re
move â¢ho only remaining cause by con
ferring the full and necessary power, on
the Secretary of the Treasury, and im
pose upon him the duty to uphold the
present gold standard and preserve the.
coins of the two metals on a parity with
each other, which is the repeatedly de
clared policy of the United States. .
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations, that a portion of trfo
gold holdings shall bo placed In a trust
fund from which greenbacks shall be re
deemed upon presentation, but when once
redeemed shall not thereafter be paid
out except for gold
? MERCHANT MARINE
6 â 
o Our Maritime Strength Shculd Be Com*
o mensurate With the Country's
| Industrial Achievement.
â¢
The value of an American merchant
marine to the extension of our commer
cial trade and the strengthening of our
p.wer upon the sea Invites the Imme
diate action of Congress. Our national
envelopment will bo one-sided and unsat
<ry so long as the remarkable
growth of our inland industries remains
â â¢mpanied by progress on the seas.
TbaM Is no lack of constitutional author
ity for legislation which Khali give to the
country maritime strength commensur
ate with Its industrial achievements and
with its rank among the nations of the
earth.
The past year has recorded exceptional
activity In our shipyards and the prom
ises of continual prosperity in shlp-
building are ahundant.
Advanced legislation for
the protection of our
seamen has been en
acted. Our coast trade,
under regulations wise
ly framed at the begin
ning of the Government
and since, shows results
for the past fiscal year
unequaled In our rec
ords, or those of any
other p<.w.-r. We shail
fail to realize our op
portunities, however, if
we complacently r^Rard
only matters at home
nnd blind ourselves to
the necessity of secur
ing our share in the
valuable carrying trade of the world.
].a*t year American vessels transported
a share of our exports and im
ports than during any former year In all
our history, and the measure of our de
pendence upon foreign shipping was
painfully manifested to our people.
Without any choice of our own. hut from
My. the departments of the Gov
ernment charged with military and naval
operations In the East and West Indies,
had to obtain from foreign flags mer
cimnt'vc.'-ECis essential for those opera
tions.
Th.Â» other great nations have not hesi
tated to adopt the required means to de
â¢'..)> their shipping as a factor in na
tional defense and as one of the surest
and speediest means of obtaining for
their produce a share in foreign mar
kets. Like vigilance and effort on our
part cannot fail to improve our situation,
which Is regarded with humiliation at
home and with surprise abroad. Even
i he seeming' sacrifices, which at the be
ginning may be involved, will be offset
later by more than equivalent gains.
The expense is as. nothing compared to
the advantage to he achieved.. The re
establishment of our merchant marine
involves In a large measure our contin
â â â â¢ 1 industrial progress and the exten
sion of our commercial triumphs. 1 am
satisfied the Judgment of the country fa
vors the policy of aid to our merchant
marine, which will broaden our com
merce and markets and upbuild our sea 1
carrying capacity for the products of ag
riculture and manufacture. â¢ and which,
with the increase of our navy, mean
more work and wages to our country
men, as well as a safeguard to American
Interests In every part of the world.
TRUSTS.
Question Is Important and Far-Reach
ing:, and v\ise and Judicious
Action Must Be Taken.'
*oÂ«o*o*o; o â¢ o 'â¢ o*o*oÂ»o;oii
Combinations of r;ipital organized into
trusts to control the coni!ttiÂ«;ns of trad.;
anioiiÃ our citizens, to stifle competition,
limit production and determine the prices
of products DMd and consumed hy the
people, are justly provoking public dls
n and should early claim the atten
tion of the Congress.
The industrial commission, created by
the act of Congress of June IS. 1*96.
has been engaged in extended hearings
upon the disputed questions involved in
the subject of combination In restraint of
trade and competition. Thoy have not
yet completed their investigation of this
subject nnd the conclusions and recom
mendations at which they may arrive are
undetermined.
The subject it one riving rise to many
divergent views as to the nature and va
riety or cause and extent of the Injuries
to the public, which may arise from large
combinations concentrating more or less
numerous enterprises and establishments,
which previously to the formation of the
combination were carried on separately.
It is universally conceded that combin
ations which engross or control the mar
ket of any particular kind of merchan
dise or commodity necessary to the gen
eral community by suppressing natural
and ordinary' competition, whereby prices
are unduly enhanced to the general con
sumer, are obnoxious not only to the
common law, but also a? to the public
welfare. There must be a remedy for the
evils involved In such organizations. If
the present law can be extended more
certainly to control or check these mon
opolies or trusts. It should be done with
out delay. Whatever power Congress
possesses over this most Important sub
ject should be promptly ascertained and
asserted.
President Harrison, in his annual mes
sage of December 3, IRS9, says:
"Earnest attention should be given by
Congress to a consideration of the ques
tion how far the restraint of those com
binations of capital commonly , called
'Trusts' is matter of Federal jurisdic
tion. When organized, as they often are.
to crush out all healthy competition and
to monopolize the production or sale of
an article of commerce and general ne
cessity they are dangerous conspiracies
against the public good and they should
be made the subject of prohibitory and
even penal legislation."
An act to protect trade and commerce
against unlawful restraints and monopo
lies was passed by Congress on the sec
ond of July. IK*V The provisions of this
statute are comprehensive, and stringent.
It declares every contract or combination
In the form of a trust- or otherwise or
conspiracy in the restraint of trade or
commerce among the several States or
with foreign nations to be unlawful. It
denominated as a criminal every person
who makes any such contract or engages
in any such combination or conspiracy
and provides a punishment by tin* or im
prisonment. It invests the several Cir
cuit Courts of the -United States with
jurisdiction to prevent and restrain vio
lations of the act; an.. makes it the duty
of the several United States District At
torneys, under the direction of the Attor
ney General, to institute, proceedings in
equity to prevent and restrain such vio
lations. It further confers upon any per
son or corporation damaged by
reason of anything forbidden or
declared to be unlawful by the
act the power to sue therefor In any
Circuit Court of the United States with
out respect to the amount in controversy,
and to recover threefold the damages by
him sustained and the costs of the suit,
including reasonable attorney fees. It
will be perceived that the act is aimed at
every kind of combination in the nature
of a trust or monopoly in restrain of In
terstate or international commerce.
. The prosecution by the United States
of offenses under the act of 1890 has been
frequently resorted to in the Federal
courts and notable efforts in the re
straint of Interstate commerce, such as
the Trans-Missouri Freight Association
and the Joint Traffic Association, have
been successfully opposed and sup
pressed.
â  President Cleveland, in his annual mes
sage of December 7. I.W. â more than six
years subsequent to the enactment of
this lawâ after stating the evils of theso
trust combinations, says:
"Though Congress has attempted to
deal with this matter by legislation, the
laws passed for that purpose thus far
have proved ineffective, not because of
any lack of disposition or attempt to en
force them, but simply because the laws
themselves as interpreted by the courts
do not reach the difficulty. If the Insuffi
ciencies of the existing laws can be rem
edied Iby further legislation, It should be
done. 'â¢ The fact must bo recognized, how
ever,'that all Federal legislation on this
subject may fall short of Its purpose be
cause of inherent obstacles and also be
cause! of- the complex character of our
governmental system, which, while mak
ing the Federal authority supreme within
Its sphere, has carefully limited that
sphere by metes and bounds which can
not be transgressed. The decision nt our
highest court on this precise question
renders :It quite doubtful whether tho
evils -of ' trusts and monopolies can be
adequately treated through Federal ac
tion unless they seek directly and pur
posely to include In their objects trans
portation or Intercourse between States
or between the United States and foreign
countries. "â¢-*
"It does not follow, however, that this
Is the limit of the remedy that may be
applied. Even though it may be found
that Federal authority Is not broad
enough to fully reach tho case, there can
be no reason to doubt the power of the
several States to act
effectively in the prem
ises, and there should
be no reason to doubt
their willingness to Ju
diciously exercise such
power."
The State legislation
to which President
Cleveland looked for re
lief from the evil of
trusts has failed to ac
complish fully that ob
ject. This is probably
'due to a great extent
to the fact that differ
ent States take differ
ent views as to the
proper way to discrim
inate between evil and
injurious combinations and those
associations which are beneficial and necf
essary to the business prosperity of the
country. The great diversity of treat
ment in different States arising from this
cause and the Intimate relations of all
parts of the country to each other with
out regardinc St;u>- lines In the conduct
of business have made the enforcement
of State laws difficult.
It Is apparent that uniformity of legis

the United States to
which I referred In my

Having been invited
by Belgium to partici

BRAZIL.
A convention of extradition with Bra

by the Brazilian Legislature.
During the past summer two national

Brazilian ports on a friendly mission and
have been cordially re

to a passing misunder

sought to cultivate with
the commonwealths of
the Western Continent.
COLOMBIA
The claim flowing out of the seizure
of the American-owned newspaper, the

ities of Colombia, has been settled, after
a controversy of several years, by an
agreement assessing at $3t),000 the indem

each. The goodwill of Colombia toward
our country has been testified anew by
the cordial extension of facilities to the
Nlcaraguan Canal Commission in their
approaching investigation of the Pan

across the Isthmus of Darien. Toward
the end of October an Insurrectionary

FRANCE.

Preparations for the representation of
the industries, arts and" products of the
United States at the Worlds Exposition
to be held in Paris next year continue
on an elaborate and comprehensive
pcale. â¢hanks to the generous appropri
ation provided by Congress and to the
friendly Interest the French Government
has shown In further
ing a typical exhibit of
American progress.
There has been al
lotted to the United
States a considerable
add i t ion of space,
which, while placing
our country In the 11 ret
rank among exhibitors,
does not suffice to meet
the increasingly urgent
demands of our manu
facturers. . The efforts
of - - the Commissioner
General are ably di
rected toward a strictly
representative d i splay
of all that most char
act c r lstlcally marks
American achievement in the inventive
arts, and most adequately shows the ex
cellence of our natural productions.
In this age of keen rivalry among na
tions for mastery in commerce the doc
trine of evolution and the rule of the
survival of the fittest must bo as inex
orable in their opinion as they are posi

place won in the struggle by an Industrial
people can only be held by unrelated
endeavor and constant advance .in
achievement. The present extraordinary
impetus In every line of American expor
tation and the astounding increase In the
volume and value of our share in the
world s markets may
not be attributed to ac

GERMANY.
Our relations with
Germany continue most
cordial. The increasing
Intimacy of direct asso
ciation has been mark
ed during the year by
the granting permission
in April lor the landing on our
shores of a cable from Boskum
J-"mden, on the North Sea, by way of the
Azores, and also by the conclusion on
September 2 of a parcels post convention
with the German empire. In all j that
promises closer relations of Intercourse
and commerce, and a better understand
ing between the two races having bo
many traits In common. Germany can be
assured of the most cordial co-operation
of this Government and people. We may
be rivals in many material paths, but our
rivalry should be generous and open, ever,
aiming toward the attainment of larger
results and the most beneficial advance
ment of each In the line of its especial
adaptability. -. : ,
The several governments of the empire
seem* reluctant to admit the natural ex

thÂ« care with which their purity is
guarded by rigid Inspection from the

the packing establishments, to the port
of shipment. Our system of control over
exported food staples invites examina
tion from any quarter and challenges
respect by Its efficient thoroughness.

Governments will act in common accord
toward lite realization of their common
purpose to safeguard the public health
and to the insuring of â  the purrty and

Efforts to obtain for American life In

I am also glad to announce that the
German Insurance companies have been

Subsequent to the exchange of our peace
treaty with Spain, Germany acquired the
Caroline Islands by purchase, paying
therefor $5,000,000. Assurances have

ary s and traders there will bÂ© consid
erately observed.
GREfIT BRITAIN.
In my last annual message I referred
to the pending negotiations with Great
Britain in reÃpect to the Dominion of
Canada. By means of an executive
agreement a Joint high commission had
l . .11 created for the purpose of adjust
ir.p all unsettled questions between the
United States ana Canada, embracing
twelve subjects, among which were the
>ns of the fur seals, the fisheries
of the coast and contiguous inland wa
ters, the Alaskan boundary, the transit
of merchandise in bond, the alien labor
laws, mining rights, reciprocity in trade,
revision of tho agreement respecting
naval vessels in the Great Lakes, a more
complete marking of parts of the boun
dary, provision for the conveyance of
criminals and for wrecking and salvage.
Much progress had been made by the
oommlsaioo toward the adjustment of
many of these questions, when it became
apparent that an irreconcilable difference
rwi was entertained respecting the
delimitation of the Alaskan boundary.
In the failure of an agreement as to the
â¢ n .if articles 3 and 4 of the treaty
i, between Russia and Great Bri
tain, which defined the boundary be
tween Alaska and Canada, tho Ameri
can Commissioners proposed that the
subject of the boundary be laid aside and
that the remaining questions of differ
!â¢â¢? proceeded with, some of which
w.r.* m far advanced as to assure the
probability of a settlement. This being
declined by the British Commissioners,
an adjournment was taken until the
boundary should be ad-
Justed by the two gov
ernments. The subject
has been reeerving the
careful attention which
Its Importance de
mand?, with the result
that a modus vivendl
for provisional demark
attons in the region
about the head of I.ynn
canal has been agreed
upon and It is hoped
that the negotiations
now In progress be
tween the two govern
ments will end In an
apn <-ment for the es
tablishment and delimi
tation of a permanent
boundary. Apart from - these ques
tions,' growing out of our relationship
with our northern neighbor, the most
friendly disposition and ready agreement
have marked the discussion of the nu
merous matters arising In the vast and
Intimate Intercourse of the United States
with Great Britain.
This Government has maintained an at
titude of neutrality In the unfortunate
contest between Great Britain and the
Boer States of Africa. We have remain
ed faithful to the precept of avoiding en
tangling alliances as to affairs not of our
own direct concern. Had circumstances
suggested that the parties to the quarrel
would have welcomed any kindly expres
sion of the hope of the American people
that the war might be averted, good of
fices would have been gladly tendered.
The United States representative at Pre
toria was early Instructed to see that all
neutral American Interests bo respected
by the combatants. This has been an
easy task. In view of the positive dec
larations of both British and Boer au
thorities that the personal and property
rights of our citizens should be observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British
agent from Pretoria, the United States
Consul was authorized, upon the request
of the British Government and with the
assent of the South African and Orange
Free State Governments, to exercise the
customary good offices of a neutral for
the care of British interests. In the
discharge of this function I am happy
to say that abundant opportunity has
been afforded to show the impartiality of
this Government to both the combatants.
ITALY.
For the fourth time in the present de
cade question has arisen with the Gov
ernment of Italy In regard to lynching of
Italian subjects. The latest of these de
plorable events occurred at Tallulah,
Louisiana, whereby five unfortunates of
Italian origin were taken from Jail and
handed.
The authorities of the State and a rep
resentative of the Italian Embassy hav
ing separately Investigated the occurrence
with discrepant results, particularly as
to the alleged citizenship of the victims.
and it not appearing
that the State had been
able to discover and
punish the violators of
the law, an independent
investigation has been
set on foot through the
agency of the Depart
ment of State and 1*
still In progress. The
result will enable the
executive to treat the
question with the Gov
ernment of Italy In a
spirit of fairness and
Justice. A satisfactory
solution will doubtless
be reached.
The recurrence of
distressing mani-
festationa of blind* mob fury directed
at dependents or natives of a foreign
country suggests that the contingency
has arisen for action by Congress In the
direction of conferring upon the Federal
courts Jurisdiction In this class of inter
national cases, where the responsibility
of the Federal Government may be in
volved. The suggestion is not new. In
his annual message of December P. 1891,
my predecessor, President Harrison,
said: ..
"It would be. I believe, entirely com
petent for Congress to make offenses
against the treaty rights of. â¢ foreigners
domiciled in the United States cogniz
able in the Federal courts. This has not,
however, been done and the Federal oin
cers and courts have no power in such
cases to intervene either for the protec
tion of a foreign citizen or for the pun
ishment of his slayers. It seems to me
to follow, in this state of the law, that
the officers of the State charged with
police and judicial powers in such cases
must, in consideration of international
questions growing out of such incidents,
be regarded in such sense as Federal
agents as to make this Government an
swerable for their acts In cases where
It would be answerable if the United
States had used its constitutional power
to define and punish crimes against
treaty- rights." :.- â¢; '.>â :.'â 'â '> .
A bill to provide for the punishment of
violations of treaty rights of aliens was
introduced In the Senate March 1. 1 C 32,
and reported favorably March 20. Hav
ing, doubtless, j^n. view, pt .the language of
that part of article 3 of the treaty of Feb
ruary 26, 1871, between the I'nited States
and Italy, wherein it is stipulated that the
"citizens of each of the high contracting
parties shall receive, in the States and/
Territories of the other, most constant
protection and security for their persons
and property and shall enjoy in this re
spect the same rights and privileges as
are or shall be granted to the natives on
their submitting themselves to the con
ditions imposed upon the natives," the
bill so Introduced and reported provides
that any act committed in any State or
Territory of the United States in viola
tion of the rights of a citizen or subject
of a foreign country secured to such
citizen or subject by treaty between the
L'nited States and such foreign country
and constituting a crime under the laws
of the State or Territory â hall constitute
a like crime against the United States
and be cognizable in ihe Federal courts.
No action was taken by Congress In the
matter.
I earnestly recommend that the subject
be taken up anew and be acted upon dur
ing the present session. The necessity
for some such provision abundantly ap
pears. Precedent for constituting a Fed
eral Jurisdiction in criminal cases where
aliens are sufferers is rationally deducihle
from the existing statute, which gives to
the District and circuit Courts of the
United States jurisdiction of civil suits
brought by aliens where the amount In
volved exceeds a certain sum. If suA
Jealous solicitude be shown for alien
rights In cases of merely civil and pecun
iary import, how much greater should be
the public duty to take cognizance of
matters affecting the life and the rights
of aliens under the settled principles of
international law no less than under
treaty stipulation. In cases of such trans
cendent wrong doing as mob murder, es-
peclally when experience has shown that
local Justice is too often helpless to pun
ish the offenders. After many years of
endeavor on the part of this Government
to that end. the Italian Government ha 3
consented to enter into negotiations for
a naturalization convention, having for
one. of Its objects the regulation of the
status of Italians (except those of an age
fqr active military service) who. having
been naturalized in the United Statea,
TiKiy revisit Italy. It is hoped that, with
the mutually conciliatory spirit display
ed, a successful conclusion will be
reached.
JAPAN.
The treaty of commerce and navigation
between the United States and Japan on
November 22. DM, took effecc In accord.
nnce with the terms of Us nineteenth
article on the 17th of July last, simultan
eously with the enforcement of like
treaties with tho other powers, except
Franc, whose convention, did not go Into
operation until August 4, tho United
States, however, being granted up
to that date all the privileges
and rights aocor.leii to French citizens
under the old French treaty. By this
iminhle conventional reform Japan's po-
Fiflon as a full ln<l. -pendent sovereign
power Is assured, control being gained of
taxation, customs revenues, judicial ad
ministration, coasting trade and all other
domestic functions of Government, and
â¢reign extraterritorial rights being re
nounced.
Comprehensive codes of civil and crim
inal procedure according to western
methods, public Instruction, patents and
copyrights, municipal administration, in
cluding Jurisdiction over the former for
eign settlements, customs tariffs and pro
cedure, public health and other admin-
istratlve measures have been proclaimed.
The working of the new system has given
rise to no material complaints on the
part of American citizens nr interests, a
circumstance which attests the ripe con
â Jderatloa with which the change has
bean prepared.
Valuable assistance was rendered by
the Japanese authorities to the United
States transport ship Morgan City, while
stranded at Kobe. Permission has been
Kranted to land and pasture army horses

the Philippine Islands. The.se kindly
evldenoe* of goodwill are highly appre
ciated.
PACIFIC COBLE.
Recommendation That Postmaster Gen
eral Be Authorized to Invite Bids
Should Congress Take NoActioa
The Japanese Government has shown a
lively interest in the proposition of the
Pacific cable to add to its projected cabU
linos to Hawaii, Guam and the Philip
pines a branch connection with the coast
of Japan. It would be a gratifying con
summation were the utility of the con
templated schema enhanced by bringing
Japan and the United State* Into direct
t< legraphlc relation.
Without repeating the observations of
my special message of February 10, 1899,
concerning the necessity of a cable to
Manila, 1 respectfully Invite attention to
it.
I recommend that in case Congress
should not take measures to bring about
this result by direct action of the Gov
ernment, the Postmaster Geneaal be au
thorized to invite competitive bids for the
establishment of a cable; the company
making the best responsible bid to be
awarded the contract, the successful
company to give ample bonds to insure
the completion of the work within a rea
sonable time.
MEXICO.
The year has been marked by constant
Increase In the intimacy of our relations
with Mexico and in the magnitude of
mutually advantageous Interchanges.
This Government has omitted no oppor
tunity to show ita strong desire to de
velop and perpetuate the ties of cordial
ity now ho long happily unbroken.
Following the termination on January
20. 1899, by Mexico of the extradition
treaty of December 11, IR9I, a new treaty
more in accord nee with the ascertained
needs of both OOtmUISS was signed Feb
ruary 22, 1X99. and sxehangsd In the city
of Mexico on tlie 22d of April last. Its
operation thus far has been effective and
satisfactory. A recent case has served to
test the application of its fourth article,
which provides that neither party shall
bÂ« bound to deliver up Its own dtlxens.
vm 1 the execut ' v e authority of each
shall have the power to deliver them up
if in its discretion it be deemed proper
to do so.
The extradition of Mrs. Mattie Rich, a
citizen of the United States, charged with
homicide committed in Mexico, was. after
mature consideration, directed by me in
the conviction that the ends of Justice
would be thereby subserved. Similar ac
tion on appropriate occasion, by the
Mexican executive, will not only tend to
accomplish the desire of both Govern
ments that grave crimes go not unpun
lfllMd, but also to repress lawlessness
along the border of the two countries.
The new treaty stipulates that neither
Government shall assume Jurisdiction in
the punishment of crimes committed ex
clusively within the territory of the other.
This will obviate in future the embar
rassing controversies which have here
tofore arisen through MexlcfTs assertion
of a claim to try and punish an Ameri
can citizen for an offense committed
within the Jurisdiction of the United
States.
â "he international water boundary com
mission, organized by the convention of
March 1, W>9, for the adjustment of ques
tions affecting the Rio Grande frontier,
has not yet completed Its labors. An ex
tension of its term for one year until De
comber 24, IWJ9, was effected by a conven
tion, signed December 2, 1898, and ex
rhanged and proclaimed in February
last.
An invitation extended to the President
of Mexico to visit Chicago in October, on
the occasion of laving the cornerstone of
the T'nlted States Government building
in that city, was cordially accepted by
him with the necessary consent of the
Mexican Congress, but the illness of a
member of his family prevented his at
tendance. The Minister of Foreign Rela
tions, however, c.ime as the personal
representative of President Diaz and in
that high character was duly honored.
RUSSIA.
Claims growing out of the seizure of 1
American sealing vessels in Bering Sea
have been under discussion with the :
Government of Russia for several years ,
with the recent happy result of an agree
ment to submit them to the decision of '
a single arbitrator. By this act Russia \
affords proof of her adherence to the
beneficent principle of arbitration which
h.-r plenipotentiaries conspicuously favor- '
ed at The Hague disarmament confer- !
ence, when it was advocated by the rep
resentatives of the United States.
A suggestion for a permanent exposl- '
tion of our products and manufactures \
in Russia, although not yet fully shaped. '
has been so cordially welcomed by the
imperial Government that it may not in
aptly take a fitting place in whatever
legislation the Congress may adopt look-
Ing to enlargement of our commercial
opportunities abroad. <
Important events have occurred in the i
Samoan Islands.- The
selection, according to
the laws and customs
of Samoa, r.f a succes

Mailetoa Laupepa. de
veloped a contest as to

terms of the general
act was to he decided
by the Chief Justice.
Upon his rendering a
Judgment in favor of
Mailetoa Tanu, the rival
chief. Mataafa. took up

and British warships

ary encounters. In this emergency a i
Joint COmmlMlon of representatives of <
the United States, Germany and Great 1
Britain, was sÂ«nt to Samoa to investigate ]
the situation and provide a temporary 1
remedy. By its active efforts a peaceful '
solution was reached for the time being, ]
the kingship being abolished and a pro- i

The inconveniences and possible perils
of the tripartite scheme of supervision
and control in the Saraoan group by pow
ers having little interest in common in ;
that quarter beyond commercial rivalry
has been once more emphasized by the
recent events. The suggested remedy of
the Joint commission, like the scheme it

The arrangement under which Samoa â¢

could not have consld-
ered any proposition for the abrogation
of the tripartite control which did not
(onfirm us In all our rights and safe
guard all our national interests In the Is- ,
lands.
Our views commended themselves to .
the other powers. A satisfactory ar
rangement was concluded between the j
Governments of Germany and of Eng
land, by virtue of which England retired
from Samoa. In view of compensations ,
In other directions and both powers re- '
nounced in favor of the United States nil
their rights and claims over and in re
spect to that portion of the group lying
t-> the east of the one hundred and seven
ty-first degree of west longitude, em
bracing the islands of Tutlla, Ofoo, Olo
penga and Manua. I transmit to the
Senate for its constitutional action there
on, a convention, which besides the pro
visions above mentioned, also guarantees
us the same privileges and conditions in
respect to commerce anil commercial ves
sels in all the islands of Samoa as
those possessed by Germany.
Claims have been preferred by whitÂ©
residents of Samoa on account of inju
ries alleged to have been Buffered through
the acts of the treaty Governments in
putting down the late disturbances. A
convention has hem made between the
three powers for the investigation nnd
settlem**nt of these claims by a neutral
arbitratory, to which the attention of the
Senate will be Invited.
TURKEY.
The United States Minister to Turkey
continues, under instructions, to press for
a money payment in satisfaction of the
just claims for injuries suffered by Amer
ican citizens in the disorders of several
years past and for wrongs done to them
by the Ottoman authorities. Some of
these claims are of many years' stand
ing. This Government Is hopeful of a
general agreement in this regard.
In the. Turkish Empire the situation of
our citizens remains unsatisfactory. Our
efforts during nearly forty yeurs to bring
about a convention of naturalization
m â  m to be on the brink of final failure
through the announced policy of th- ot
toman Porte to refuse recognition of the
alien status of native Turkish subjects
naturalized abroad since 1867. Our stat
utes do not allow this Government to ad
mit any distinction between the treat
ment of native and naturalized Americans
abcoad, so that ceaseless controversy
urlses In cans where persons owing in
the eye of international law a dual alle
giance are prevented from entering Tur
i. y or are expelled after entrance
law In this regard contrasts with that .f
the European States. The Brlti.-i
fwr Instance, does not claim effect for the
naturalization of an alien In the event of
a return to his native country, unless the
change be recognized by the law of that
country or stipulated by treaty between It
and the naturalizing State.
The arbitrary treatment In some In
stances of American productions in Tur
key has attracted attention of late, nota
bly In regard to our flour. Large ship-
ments dv tne recently
opened direct steamship
line to Turkish ports
have been denied en
trance on the score
that, although of stand
ard composition and
unquestioned purity, the
flour was pernicious to
health because of de
ficient "elasticity," as
Indicated by antiquated
and untrustworthy
tests. Upon due protest
by the American Min
ister, and it appearing
that the act was a vir
tual dlscrim ination
apainst our product, the
shipments In question
were admitted. In these, as In all
Instances, wherever occurring, when
American products may be rabjectad in
a foreign country upon specious pretexts
to discrimination compared with the l:k
products of anothÂ«*r country, this Gov
ernment will use Its earnest efforts to se
cure fair and equal treatment for Its cltl-
Eens and their goods. Failing thin, it will
not hesitate to apply whatever corrective i
may be provided by the statutes.
SPAIN.
Following the exchange of ratifications
of the treaty of peace, the two Govern
ments accredited Ministers to each other.
Spain sending to Wash
ington the Duke of Ar- '
cob. an eminent diplo- ,
matist, previously sta
tioned in Mexico, while
the United States trans
ferred to Madrid Hon.
Bellamy Btorrer, Its
Minister at Brussels.
This was followed by
the respective appoint
ment of Consuls, there
by fully resuming the
relations Interrupted by
the war.
In addition to its con
sular representation In
the United States, the
Spanish Government has
appointed Consuls for
Cuba, who hnve hÂ»en provisionally recog
nlZ'-'i durinp the military administration
of the affairs of that Island. Judicial in
tercourse between the courts of Cuba and
Porto Rico and of Spain has been estab
lished, as pmvlded by the treaty of peace
The Cuban political prisoners In Spanish
penal stations have been and are being
released and returned to their homes. In
accordance with article IV of the treaty
Negotiations are about to be had for de
fining the conventional relations between
the two countries, which fell Into abey
ance by reason of the war. I trust that
those will Include a favorable arrange
ment for commercial reciprocity under
the terms of sections 3 and 4 of the cur-
rent tariff act. In
these, as In all matters
of international con
cern, no effort will be
spared to respond to
the good disposition of
Spain, and to cultivate
in all practicable ways
the intimacy which
should prevail between
two nations whose past
history has so often and
in so many ways been
marked by sincere
friendship and by com
munity of interests.
I would recommend
appropriate legislation
in order to carry Into
execution article VIII
of the treaty of peace with Spain, by
which the T'nlted States assured the pay
ment of certain claims for Indemnity of
its citizens against Spain.
CUBfl.
) All the Administrative Measures
| Adopted Have Alnrid to Fit Cuba
\ for a Regenerated Existence.
My annual message of last year was
necessarily devoted In
great part to a consid
eration of the Spanish
war and of the results
It wrought and the con
ditions It Imposed for
the future. I am grati
fied to announce that
the treaty of peace has
restored friendly rela
tions between the two
powers. Effect has been
given to Its most Impor
tant provisions. The
evacuation of Porto
Rico having already
been accomplished on
the 18th of October.
1898. nothing remained
necessary there but to
continue the provisional military control
of the Island until the Congress nhould
enact a suitable government for the
ceded territory. Of the character and
ficope of the measures to that end. F shall
treat In another part of this mpsaagt".
The withdrawal of lue authority of Spain
from the Island of Cuba was effected Â»>v
the first of January, so that the full ro
establlshment of found the re
linquished territory held by the I'nlteJ
States in trust for the inhabitants, main
taining under the erection of the execu
tive such Government and control there
in as should conserve public order, re
store the productive conditions of pence
so long disturbed by thn instability and
disorder which prevailed for the greater
part of the precndlng three decades and
build up that tranquil development of
the domestic state whereby alone can
be realized the high purposo. as pro
claimod in the Joint resolution adopted by
the Congress on the 19th of April. 1898. by
which the I'nlted States disclaimed any
disposition or Intention to exercise sov
ereignty, jurisdiction or control over
Tuba, except for the pacification thereof,
and asserted its determination when that
was accomplished to leave the govf-rn
ment and control of the Island to Its peo
ple. ThÂ«Â» pltnlp" contained in this resolu
tion Is of the highest honorable obliga
tion and must !>Â»â  .Â«nrre<ily kept.
I believe that substantial progress has
been made in this direction. All the ad
ministrative measures adopted In Cuba
have aimed to nt It for a regenerated ex
istence by enforcing the supremacy of
law and Justice; by placing where It is
practicable the machinery of the admin
istrations In the hands of the Inhabitants;
by instituting needed sanitary reforms;
by spreading education; by fostering in
dustry and *radc: by inculcating public
morality and In short by taking every
rational step to ail the cuban people to
attain to that plane of self-conscious re
spect and self-reliant unity which fits an
enlightened community for self-govern
ment within its own sphere, while en
abling it to fulfill all outward obliga
tions.
This nation has assumed before the
world a grave responsibility for the fu
ture good government of Cuba. We have
accepted a trust the fulfillment of which
calls for the sternest integrity of pur
pose and the exercise of the highest wis
dom. The new Cuba yet to arise from
the ashes of the past must needs ba
bound to as by ties of singular Intimacy
and strength if its enduring welfare Is
to be assured. Whether those ties shall
be organic or conventional, the destinies
Of Cuba are In some rightful form and
manner Irrevocably linked with our own.
but how and how far Is for the future
to determine In the ripeness of events.
Whatever be the outcome we must see
to it that free Cuba bo a reality, not a
name, a perfect entity, not a hasty ex
periment bearing within itself the ele
ments of failure. Our mlssfon. to accom
plish which we took up the gage of bar
tie. Is not to be fulfilled by turning adrift
any loosely framed commonwealth to
the vicissitude*
which too often attend
States whose natural
wealth and abundant
resources are offset by
the incongruities of
their political organiza
tion and the securing of
occasions for Internal
rivalries to sap th*lr
strength and dissipate
their energies. The
greatest blessing which
can come to Cuba Is the
restoration of her agri
cultural and Industrial
prosperity, which will
give employment to Idle
men and re-establish
the pursuits of
This la her chief and Immediate need.
On the 19th of August last, an order
was made for thÂ© taking of the census
In the Island, to be completed on the 30th
of November.
Under the terns of the treaty of peace
the Spanish people on the Island
have until April 11. 1900, to elect whether
they will remain citizens of Spain or be
come citizens of Cuba. Until then It can
not .bo definitely ascertained who shall
be entitled to participate In the formation
of the Government of Cuba. By that time
the results of the census shall have been
tabulated and we shall proceed with the
elections, which will complete the mu
nicipal governments of the Island to the
officers elected by the people. The expe
rience thus derived will prove of great
value in the formation of a representative
convention of the people to draft a con
stitution and establish a general system
of Independent government for the Island.
In the meantime and 00 long as we exer
cise control over the Island, the products'
of Cuba should have a market In the
United States on as good terms and with
as favorable rales of duty as are given
to the West India Islands under treaties
of reciprocity which shall be made.
For the relief of the distress In the Isl
and of Cuba the War Department has
issued supplies to destitute persons
through the officers of the army, which
have amounted to 6,433.000 rations at
cost of $1,417,564 87.
To promote the disarmament of the
Cuban volunteer army and In the inter
est of public peace and the welfare of the
people the sum of $75 was paid to each
Cuban soldier borne on the authenticated
rolls on condition that he should deposit
his arms with the authorities designated
by the United States. The sum thus dis
bursed aggregated $2,674,750. which wan
paid from the emergency fund provided
by the act of January 6, 183?. for that
purpose.
Of the Cuban Island revenues during
the nix months, ending June SO. MM.
$1,712,014 80 was expended for sanitation.
$298,881 70 for charities and hospitals and
$88,944 03 for aid to the destitute.
VENEZUELA.
The Intern atlonal
Commission of Arbitra
tion, appointed under
the Anglo-Venezuelan
treaty of l*Â« 7. rendered
an award on October S
last whereby the boun
dary line between Ven
ezuela and British Qul
ana Is determined, thus
ending a controversy
which has existed for
the greater part of the
century. The award, as
to which the arbitra
tors were unanimous,
while not meeting the
extreme contention of either party,
gives to . Great Britain a large
share of the Interior territory In dispute
and to Venezuela th..- entire mouth of the
Orinoco, Including Barlmo Point, and the
Caribbean littoral for love distance to
the eastward.
The decision appears to be equally sat
isfactory to both parties. Venezuela has

AMERICAN REPUBLICS.
ThÂ» interest taken by the various

CZAR'S CONFERENCE.
In response to the invitation of bis
Majesty the Emperor of Russia, dele
gates from twonty-slx countries were as
sembled at The Hague on the ISth of May
as members of a conference in the in
terest of peace. The commission from
the United States consisted of the Hon.
Andrew White, the Hon. Seth Low, the
Hon. Stanford Newell, Captain Alford T.
Mahan of the United Stales navy. Cap
tain William T. Crozier of the United
Mates army and the
Hon. Frederick W.
Holls, secretary. The
occasion seemed to be
opportune for the seri
ous consideration of a
plan for the pacific ad
justment of Interna
tional differences, a
subject in which the
American people have
been deeply interested
for many years, and a
definite project for a
permanent international
tribunal was Included in
the Instruction to the
delegates to the United

The provision for arbitration con
templates th*- formation of a permanent
tribunal before which disputed cases may
be brought for settlement by the mutual
consent of the litigants in each separate
case. The advantages of such a perma
nent tribunal over impromptu commis
sions of arbitration are conceived to be
the actual existence of a competent court
prepared to administer Justice, the greater
economic resulting from a well devised
system and the accumulated Judicial skill
and experience which such a tribunal
would soon possess. While earnestly pro

Thus Interpreted, the convention for
the pacific settlement of International
conflicts may be regarded as realizing tho
earnest desire <>f groat numbers of Amer
ican citizens whose deep sense of Justice,
expressed in numerous resolutions and
memorials, has urged them to labor for
this noble achievement. The general
character of this convention, already
signed by the delegates of more thar
twenty sovereign States,
further commends it to
the favorable action of
the Senate of the
United States, whoso
ra 1 1 flcatlon It still
awaits.
THE NAVY.
The navy has main
tained the spirit and
high efficiency which
have always character
ized that service, and
has lost none of the
gallantry In heroic ac
tion which has signal
ized Its brilliant and
glorious past. The na-
tlon hns equal pride In its early
and later achievements. Its habitual
readiness for every emergency has won
the confidence and admiration of the
country- The people are interested In the
continued preparation and prestige of the
navy and will Justify liberal appropria
tions for its maintenance and improve
ment. The officers have shown peculiar
adaptation for the performance of new
and delicate duties which our recent war
has Imposed.
It cannot be doubted that Congress will
at once make necessary provision for ar
mor elates for the vessels now under
contract and building. It* attention Is
respectfully called to the report of the
Secretory of the Navy, in which the sub
ject Is fully presented. I unite in his
recommendation that Congress enact such
legislation as may Â»â¢â¢ necessary to enable
tho department to make contracts early

quality that can bo obtained In this coun
try for the Maine. Ohio and Missouri, and
that the provision of the act of March 3.
1599. limiting the price of armor to 5300
per ton. be removed.
In the matter of naval construction It Is
said Italy and Japan of the great power*
laid down less tonnage in th.- year UN
than this country, and Italy alone has
less tonnage under construction. I heart
ily concur in the recommendations for
the Increase of the navy as suggested by

THE ARMY.
'res'dent Commends Conduct of Offi
cers and Men In Trying Situations
and Unusual Difficulties.
Since my last annual message and In
obedience to the acts of Congress of
April 22 and 26. ISI*B, the remaining volun
teer rnrce enlisted for the Spanish war.
consisting of 34.534 regulars and 110,202
volunteers, with over 5000 volunteer offi
cers, has been discharged from the mili
tary service. Of the volunteers 667 offi
cers and 14.531 men were serving In the
Philippines, and 1660 of the regulars, who
were entitled to bo mustered out after
the ratincatlon of the treaty of peace,
voluntarily remained at the front
until their places could bo filled by new
troops. They were returned home in the
order in which they went to Manila and
are now all of them out of the service
and in the ranks of citizenship. I rec
ommend that Congress provide a special
medal of honor for the volunteers, regu
lars, sailors and marines on duty in the
Philippines, who voluntarily remained in
the service after their terms of enlistment
had expired.
By the act of March 2. 1599. Congress
has authority to Increase the regular
army to a maximum not exceeding 65,000
enlisted men, and to enlist a force of 35,
000 volunteers, to be recruited from the
country at large. By virtue of this au
thority the regular army has been In
creased to the number of 61,9?Wnlisted
men and 2248 officers, and new volunteer
regiments have been organized aggregat
ing 33.050 enlisted men and 1&24 officers.
Two of these volunteer regiments are
made up of colored men, with colored line
officers. The new troops to tnke the
places of those returning from the Phil
ippines have been transported to Manila
to the number of SSI officers and 28,322 en
listed men of the regular army and &94
officers and 15.SSS enlisted men of the new
volunteer force, while 504 officers and 14,
119 men of the volunteer force are on the
ocean en route to Manila.
The force now In Manila consists of 903
officers and 19,501 regulars and 594 officers
and 15.35S of the volunteers, making on
aggregate of 14iÂ«* officers and 45.9G6 men.
â When the troops now under orders "hill
rÂ»>ach Manila, the force In the archipelago
will comprise 2051 officers and 63.453 men
The muster out of the great volunteer
army organized for the
Spanish war and the
creation of a new
army, the transporta
tion to Manila to San
Francisco of those en
titled to discharge and
the transportation of
the new troops to take
their places have been
a work of great magni
tude, well and ably
done, for which too
much credit cannot be
given the War Depart
ment.
During the year we
have reduced our force
in Cuba and Porto Rico.
In Cuba we now have
334 officers and 10.796 enlisted men;
In Porto Illco 87 officers and UK
enlisted men. and a battalion of 400
men composed of native Porto Hlcans;
â while stationed throughout the United
Ktates are 910 officers and 17.317 men, and
In Hawaii 1? officers and M enlisted nun.
The operations of the army are fully
presented In the report of the Secretary
of War. I cannot withhold from officers
and men the highest commendation for
their soldierly conduct in trying situa
tions, their willing sacrifices for their
country and the interest mid ability with
which they have performed unusual and
difficult duties In our island possessions.
In the organization of the volunteer
regiments authorized by the act of March
2. 1599, it was found that no provision had
been made for chaplains. This omission
was doubtless* from Inadvertence, I rec
ommend the early authorization for the
appointment of one chaplain for each of
said regiments. These regiments are now
In the Philippines and it Is important that
immediate action bo had.
POSTAL SERVICE.
In restoring peaceful conditions, order
ly rule and civic progress In Cuba, Porto
Rico. and. so far as practicable. In the
Philippines, the rehabilitation of the pos
tal service has been an important part
of the work. It became necessary to pro
vide mail facilities both for our forces of
occupation and for the native population.
To meet this requirement has involved a
substantial reconstruction. The existing
systems were so fragmentary, defective
and Inadequate that a new and compre
hensive organization had to be created.
American trained officials have been as
signed to the directing and executive posi
tions, while the natives have been chiefly
employed In making up the body of the
force. In working out this plan the merit
rule has been rigorously and faithfully
applied.
The appointment of Director General of
Posts of Cuba was given to an expert
who has been Chief Postofllce Inspector
and Assistant Postmaster General, and
who united large experience with capaci
ty. For the post mastership of Havana
the range of skilled and
available men was
scanned, nnd the choice
fell on one who hail
been twenty years |q
the service as deputy
postmaster and post
master of a large city.
This princtple governed
and determined the se
lection of the American
officials sent, not only
to Cuba but to Porto
Rico and the Philip
pines, and they w.-n- in
structed to apply It as
far as practicable In the
employment of the na
'lvep as minor post
musters and clerks
The postal system in Cuba, though re
maining under the general guidance of
the Postmaster General, was made essen
tially independent. It was felt that it
should not be a burden on the postal serv
ice of the United States, and provision
was made that any deficit In the postal
revenue should be a charge upon the
general revenue of the island. Though
Porto Rico and the Philippines held a dif
ferent relation to the United States, yet
for convenience of administration, the
same principle of an autonomous system
has been extended to them. Development
of the servico in all of the islands has
been rapid and successful. It has moved
forward on American lines, with free de
livery, money order and registry system
and has given the people mail facilities
far greater and more reliable than they
have ever before enjoyed. It Is thus not
only a vital agency of Industrial, social
and business progress, but an Important
Influence in diffusing a Just understanding
of the true spirit and character of Ameri
can administration.
The domestic postal service continues to
grow with extraordinary rapidity The
expenditures and the revenues will exceed
1100,000,000 during the current year. For
tunately, since the revival of prosperous
times the revenues have grown much
faster than the expenditures, and there Is
every indication that a short period will
witness obliteration of the annual deficit
In this connection the report of the Post
master General embodies a statement of
some evils which have grown up outside
of the contemplation of law In the treat
ment of some classes of mall matter
which wrongly exercise the privilege of
the pound rate, and shows that if this
matter had been properly classified and
had paid the rate which it should have
paid, instead of a postal deficit last BscsJ
year of $6,610,000, there would have been
on one basis a surplus of $17,637,570, and on
another $3,733,836. The reform thus sug
gested. In the opinion of the Postmaster
General, would not only put the postal
service at once on a self-sustaining basis,
but would permit great and valuable Im
provements, and I commend the subject
to the consideration of Congress.
PENSIONS.
On the 30th of June, 1899, the pension roll
of the United States numbered 991.519.
These include the pensioners of the army
and navy in all our wars. The number
added to the rolls during the year was
40,991. The number dropped by reason of
death, remarriage, minors by legal lim
itations, failure to claim within three
years and other causes was 43,183. and tho
number of claims disallowed was 107.917.
During the year 89.0G4 pension certificates
were Issued, of which 37.077 were for new
or original pensions. The amount dis
bursed for army and navy pensions dur
ing the year was $135,353,002 95, which was
$1,651,461 61 less than the. sum of the ap
propriations. Thf OJrand Army of the Re
public at its recent national encampment
held In Philadelphia has brought to my at
tention and to that of Congress the wia-
dom and justice of a modification of the
third section of the act of June 27. 189"),
which provides pensions for the widows
of officers and enlisted men who served
ninety days or more during the war of
the rebellion and were honorably dis
charged, provided that such wM<>ws are
without other means of support than their
dally labor and wen married to the sol
dier, sailor or marine on account of whose
service they clam pension prior to the
date of the act.
The present holding of the department
is that if the widow's Income aside from
her daily labor does not exceed in
amount what her pension would be, to
wlt.. $96 per annum, she would be deem
ed to be without other means of support
than her dully labor and would be en
titled to a pension under this act. while
If the widow*! Income Independent of
the amount received by her as the result
of her daily labor, exceeds $9Â»">, she would
not be pensionable under the act. I am
advised by the Commissioner of Pensions
that the amount of the income allow-. l *
before title to pension would be barred
has varied widely under different admin
istrations of the Tension Office, as well
as during different periods of the same
administration and has been the cause of
just complaint and criticism. With the
approval of the Secretary of the Inte
rior, the Commissioner Of Pensions rec
ommends that. In order to make the prac
tice at all times uniform and to do jus
tice to the dependent widow, the amount
Of Income allowed independent of the
prooeedl of her daily labor should be not
less than 1250 per annum and he urges
that Congress shnll so amend the act as
to permit the Pension Office to grant
pensionable status to widows under the
term of the third section of the act of
June 87, IS9O. whose Income aside from
the proceed! of dally labor Is not in ex
cess of |SQ per annum. I believe this to
be a simple act of Justice and I heartily
recommend It.
DAWES COMMISSION.
Tho Dawes Commission reports that
gratifying progress has been made in its
work during the preceding year. The BeM
work of enrollment of four of the nations
has been completed. I recommend that
Congress at an early day make liberal
appropriation for educational purposes In
the Indian Territory.
THE CENSUS.
Certain That It Will Emphasize lha
Remarkable Advance of National
Progress.
In accordance with the act of Consjr>-.Â«"s
approved March 3, ]B'-9, the prel.mimry
work in connection with the twelfth â¢n
sus Is now fully under way. The officers
required for the proper administration of
the duties imposed have been selected.
The provision for securing a proper
enumeration of tho population, as well as
to secure evidence of the industrial
growth jf the nation, is broader and more
comprehensive than any similar legisla
tion In the past. The director advises that
â¢ very needful effort Is being made to
push this grÂ«at work to completion <n the
time limited by the statute. It Is he
live.l that the twelfth census will em
phasize our remarkaMe advance ;n all
that pertains to national progress.
PACIFIC RAILROADS.
Under the authority of the act of Con
gress approved July 7, 189S, the commis
sion, consisting of the Secretary of the
Treasury, Attorney General and Secre
tary of the Interior, has made an agree
ment of settlement, which has had my
approval, of the Indebtedness to the Gov
ernment growing out of the issue of bonds
to aid in the construction of the Central
Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
The agreement secures to the Govern
ment tho principal and interest of said
bonds, nmo-intlr.s to $T. 5,512.715 48. There
has been paid thereon J11.7C2.543 12. which
has been covered into the Treasury and
the remainder, payable within ten years,
with Interest at the rate of 3 per cent per
annum, payable seml-annually, Is secured
by the deposit of an equal amount of
first mortgage bonds of the Pacific rail
way companies.
The amounts paid and secured to be
paid to the Government on account of
the Pacific railway subsidy claims are:
Union Pacific, cash, $58.44;-. 223 75; Kansas
Pacific, cash, J6.933.000; Central and West
ern Pacific, cash. $11,798. 314 14.
Notes, secured. $47,050,172 36.
Kansas Pacific dividends for deficiency,
due United States, cash, $821,891 70, mak
ing a total of $124,421,017 91.
The whole Indebtedness was about $130,-
Ono.ooo, more than half of which consisted
of accrued interest, for which sum the
Government has realized the entire
amount, less about 16,000,000, within a
period of two years.
FOREST RESERVATIONS.
On June 30, IS9B, there were thirty forrst
reservations (exclusive of the Afognaic
forest and fish culture reserve In Alaska*,
embracing an estimated area of 40.719.174
acres. During the past year two of tlie
existing forest reserves, th*Â» Tr.i'>i â â¢>
Canyon (California), and Black Hills
(South Dakota and Wyoming) have l>Â»en
considerably enlarged; the area of the
Mount Ranier reserve, In the State of
Washington, has been somewhat re
duced, and six additional reserves have
been established, namely, the San Fran
cisco Mountain (Arizona), the Black Mt.-a
(Arizona). Lake Tahoe (California), Oal
latin (Montana), Gila River (New
M.xico) and Fish Lake (Utah), the t<>tul
estimated area of which is 5,(KJ5,772 acres.
This makes at the present time a total o*
thirty-six forestry reservations, embrac
ing an estimated area of IMfljM .terra.
This estimated area is the aggregated
areas within the boundaries of the re
serves. The lands actually reserved are,
however, only the vacant public lands
therein, and these have been set aside
and reserved tor Bale or settlement in
order that they may be of she greatest
use to the people.
Protection of the national forests. In
augurated by the Department of the Jn
trior in 1897. has increased during the
past year, and much has been accom
plished in the way of preventing forest
fires and the protection of the tlmb<-r.
There are now largo tracts covered by
forests which will eventually be reserved
and set apart for forest uses. I'ntil thnt
can be done Congress should increase the
appropriations for the work of protecting
the forests.
AGRICULTURE.
The Department of Agriculture is con
stantly consulting the needs of producers
In all tho States and Territories. It is in
troducing seeds and plants of great value
and promoting fuller diversification of
crops. Grains, grasses, fruits, legumes
and vegetables are imported for all parts
of tho United States. I'ndcr this encour
agement tho boot sugar factory multiplies
In the North and far West, semi-tropical
plants are sent to the South, and conge
nial climates are sought for the choice
productions of the far East. The hy
bridizing of fruit trees and grains is con
ducted In tho search for varieties adapted
to existing conditions. The introduction
of tea gardens Into the Southern States
promises to provide employment for Idle
hands, as well as to supply to home mar
ket with tea. The subject of Irrigation
whore it is of vital importance to the
people Is being carefully studied, steps
are being taken to reclaim injured or
abandoned lands, and information for the
people along thoÃe lines is being printed
and distributed.
-Nf.irkets are being sought and opened
tip for surplus farm and factory products
in Europe and in Asia. The outlook for
the education of the young farmer
through agricultural college experiment
stations, with opportunity Bjtveii to
specialize in the Department of Agricul
ture, is very promising. The people of
Hawaii, PortÂ© FUco and the Philippine
Ishimls have been helped by the estab
lishment of experiment stations to a more
scientific knowledge of the production of
COffee, India rubber and other tropical
products, for which there is demand in the
I'nited States.
There is widespread Interest in the lm
prorement of our public highways at the
present time, and the Department of Ag
riculture is co-operating with the people
in each locality in making the best pos
sible roads from the local material, and
in experimenting with steel tracks.
A more intt'lliirÂ« nt system of managing
the forests of the country is being put
in operation, and a careful study of the
whole forestry problem is being conducted
throughout the T'nited States. A very ex
tensive and complete exhibit of the ag
ricultural and horticultural products of
the I'nited States Is being prepared for
the Paris Exposition.
j THE PHILIPPINES.
)
j No Promise of Independence to Aguln
) aldo â The Islands Are Ours and
> Cannot Be Abandoned.
On the 10th of December. 185S, the treaty
of peace between the United States and
Spain was signed. It provided, among
other things, that Spam should cede to
the United States the archipelago known
as the Philippine Islands; that the United
States should pay to Spain the sum of
$20,000,000, and that the civil rights and
political status of the native inhabitants
of the territories thus ceded to the United
States should be determined by Con
gress. The treaty was ratified by tho
Benate on the 6th of February, is? 9. and
by the Government of Spain on the 19th
of March following. The ratifications
were exchanged on the 11th of April and
the treaty publicly proclaimed. On the
2d of March Congress voted the nim
contemplated by the treaty, and the
amount was paid over to the Spanish
Government on the Ist of Mny.
In this manner the Philippines came to
the United States. The islands were ceded
by the Government of Spain, which had
been In undisputed possession of them
for centuries. They were accepted not
merely by our authorized commissioners
in Paris under the direction of the execu
tive, but by the constitutional and wpll
consldered action of the representative
of the people of the United States In both
houses of Congress. I had every reason
to believe, and I still believe, that this
transfer of sovereignty was in accordance
â¢with tho wishes and the aspirations of
the great mass of the Filipino people.
From the earliest moment no opportunity
was lost of assuring the people of the
islands of our ardent desire for their wel
fare and of the intention of this Govern
ment to do everything possible to advance
their interests. In my ordor of May 19,
IW, the commander of the military expe
dition dispatched to the Philippines was
Instructed to declare that we came not to
make war upon the people of the country,
"nor upon any part or faction among
them, but to protect them In their homes,
m their employments and in their per
sonal and rcliglou-, rights." That there
should be no doubt as to the paramount
authority there, on August 17 it was di
rected that "there must be no Joint occu
pation with the Insurgents"; that the
United States must preserve the peace
and protect persons and property within
the territory occupied by their military
and naval forces; that the Insurgents and
all others must recognize the military oc
cupation and authority of the United
States. As early as December 4, and be
fore the cession, and In anticipation of
that event, the commander in Manila was
urged to restore peace and tranquillity
and to undertake the establishment of a
beneficent government, which should af
ford the fullest security for life and prop
erty. On December 21. after the treaty
â¢was signed, the commander of the forces
of occupation was instructed "to an
nounce and proclaim in the most public
manner that we come, not as Invaders
and conquerors, but as friends to protect
the natives In their homes, in their em
ployments and In their personal and reli
gious rights."
The same day while ordering General
Otis to see that peace should be DTSSSfTSd
In Hollo, he was admonished that "It Is
most Important that there should be no
conflict with the insurgents." On the Ist
day of January. ly.O, your ge. Â«ral ofdsn
were reiterated that the kindly intentions
Of this Government should be in every
possible way communicated to the Insur
gents.
On the 21st of January I announced my
Intention of dispatching to Manila a com
mission composed of three gentlemen o f
the highest character and distinction,
thoroughly acquainted with the Orient,
who, in association with Admiral Dewey
and Major General Otis, were Instructed
to "facilitate the most humane and effect
ive extension of authority throughout the
Islands and to secure, with the least pos
sible delay, the benefits of a wise and
generous protection of life and property
to the Inhabitants."
These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould
Schurman. president of the Cornell Uni
versity the Hon. Charles Denby. for
many years Minister to China, and Pro
fessor Dean C. Worcester of the Univer
sity of Michigan, who had made a most
careful study r.f life in the Philippines.
While the treaty of peace was under con-
federation in the Senate these Commis
sioners set out on their mission of good
will and liberation. Their character was
a sufficient guaranty of the beneficent
purpose with which they wont, even If
they had not borne the positive instruc
tions of this Government, which m.t.10
their errand pre-eminently one of pmt â 
ami friendship.
Hut before their arrival at Manila the
sinister ambition of a few Iâ rtori of the
Filipinos had created a situation full <.f
embarrassments for us and must grievous
in its consequences to themselves. The
clear and impartial preliminary report of
the Commissioners, which I transmit
herewith, gives so lucid and comprehen
sive a history of the present insurrection
ary movement that the story need not be
here repeated. It Is enough to say that
the claim of the rebel leader that he was
promised Independence by any officer of
the United States In return for his assist
ance has no foundation In fact un<l Is
categoric.illy denied by the very witnesses
who were called to prove It. The most
the insurgent leader hoped for when ho
came back to Manila was the liberation
of the Islands from the Spanish control,
which they hail hern laboring for years
without success to throw off.
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other Ideas and ambitions, and
insidious suggestions from various quar
ters perverted the purposes and intentions
with which he had taken up arms No
sooner had our army captured Manila
than the Filipino forces b*?gan to as-umo
an attitude of suspicion and hostility
which tho utmost efforts of our offWr*
and troops were unable to <!l--arm or mod
ify. Their kindness and forbearance wore
taken as proof of cowardice. The aggres-

Blons of the Filipinos continually In
creased, until finally. Just before the time
set for the Senate of the United States for
a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evi
dently prepared in advance, was made all
along the American lines, which result*!
in a terribly destructive and sanguinary
repulse of the Insurgents.
BARBAROUS REBEL ORDER.
Ten days later an orÂ«'-r of the insur
gent Government was Issued to Its adher
ents who had remained in Manila, of
which General Otis justly observes that
"for barbarous' intent it is unequalcd la
modern time*." it directs that at 8 o'clock
on the night of the 4th of February # tho
territorial militia shall come together la
the streets of San Pedro, armed with
their boles, with guns and ammunition,
where convenient: that Filipino families
only shall be respected: but that all other
individuals, of whatever race they may
be. shall be exterminated without any
compassion after the extermination of
the army of occupation, and adds:
"Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on
the Americans and exterminate them,
that we may take our revenge for the. In
famies and treacheries which they have
committed upon us. Have no compassion
upon them: attack with vigor."
A copy of this fell by good fortune Into
the hands of our officers and they were
able to take measures to control the ris
ing, which was actually attempted on the
night of February 22. a week later than
was orgtnally contemplated. A consider
able number of armed insurgents entered
the city by waterways and swamps and
in. concert with confederates Inside at
tempted to destroy Manila by fire. They
were kept In check during the night and
the next day driven out of the city with
heavy loss.
This was the unhappy condition of af
fairs which confronted our Commission
er* on their arrival in Manila. They had
come with the hope and intention of co
operating with Admiral Dewey and Major
General Otis in establishing peace and
order In the archipelago and the largest
measure of self-government compatible
with the true welfare of the. people. What
they actually found can best be set forth
In their own words:
"Deplorable as war Is. the one In which
wo are now engaged was unavoidable by
us. We were attacked by a bold, adven
turous and enthusiastic army. No alter
native was left to us except retreat.
"It Is not to be conceived of th it any
American would have sanctioned the sur
render of Manila to the Insurgents. Our
obligations to other nations and to the
friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and
our flag demanded that force should bo
met by force. Whatever the future of the
Philippines may be. there Is no course
open to us now except the prosecution of
the war until the insurgents are reduced
to submission. The commission Is of the
opinion that there has been no time since
the destruction of the Spanish squadron
by Admiral Dewey when It was possible
to withdraw our forces from the Islands,
either with honor to ourselves or with
safety to the Inhabitants."
"RIGHTEOUS CAMPAIGN."
The course thus clearly indicated has
been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel
lion must he put down. Civil government
cannot be thoroughly established until or
der Is restored. With a devotion and gal
lantry worthy of Its most brilliant his.
Tory, the army, ably and loyally assisted
by the navy, has carried on this unwel
come but most righteous campaign with
richly deserved success. The noble self
sacriflco with which our soldiers and sail
ors whose terms of service had expired
refused to avail themselves of their right
to return home as long as they were
needed at the front forms one of the
brightest pages In our annals. Although
their operations have been somewhat In
terrupted and checked by a rainy season
of unusual violence and duration, they

NEGROS GOVERNMENT.
The unfavorable circumstances con
nected with an active campaign have not
been permitted to Interfere with the
equally Important work of reconstruction.
Again 1 Invite your attention to the re
port of the Commissioners for the Inter
esting and encouraging details of the
work already accomplished in the estab
lishment of peace and order and the in
auguration of self-governing municipal
life in many portions of the archipelago.
A notable beclnnlng has been made in the
establishment of a Government in the
Island of Negros, which Is deserving of
special consideration.
This was the first Island to accept
American sovereignty. Its people unre
servedly proclaimed allegiance to the
United States, and adopted a constitution
looking to the establishment of a popular
government. It was impossible to guar
antee to the people of NegTos that the
constitution so adopted should be the ulti
mate form of government. Such a Ques
tion, under the treaty with Spain and In
accordance with our own constitution
and laws, came exclusively under the
Jurisdiction of Congress. The Govern
ment actually set up by the Inhabitants
of Negros eventually proved unsatisfac
tory to the natives themselves. A new
â¢y*tem was put in force by order of the
major genera* commanding the depart
ment, of which the following are the most
Important elements:
It was ordered that the Government of
the Island of Negros should consist of a
Military Governor appointed by the
United States Military Governor of the
Philippines, and a civil Governor and an
Advisory Council elected by the people.
The Military Governor was authorized to
appoint secret of the Treasury, In
terior, Agriculture, Public Instruction, an
Attorney General and an Auditor. The
peat of Government was fixed at Bacolor.
The Military Governor exercises the su
preme executive power. He Is to see that
the laws are executed, appoint to office
and fill all vacancies In office not other
wise provided for and may, with the ap
proval of the Military Governor of the
Philippines, remove any of.leer from
oflk*. The civil Governor advises the Mil-

Everything Indicates that with the speedy
suppression of the Tagalo rebellion, life
in the archipelago will soon assume its
ary course under the protection of
our sovereignty, and the people of those
favored Islands will enjoy a prosperity
and a freedom which they have never
before known. Already hundreds of
schools are open and tilled with children.

PHILIPPINES' FUTURE.
The future government of the Philip
pines rests with the Congress of the
United States. Few graver responsibili
ties have ever been confided to us. If
we accept them In a spirit worthy of our
race and our traditions, a great opportu
nity comes with them. The Islands lie
under the shelter of our flag. They ure
| ours by every title of law and equity.
: They cannot be abandoned. If we desert
â  them, wo leave them at once to anarchy
and Anally to barbarism. We fling them.

would take from the Congress of the
united States the power of declaring war
and vest that tremendous prerogative in
the Tagalo leader of the hour.
It does not seem desirable that I should
recommend at this time a specific and
final form of government for these isl
ands. When peace shall be restored it
will be the duty of Congress to construct
a plan of government which shall estab
lish and maintain freedom, order and
peace in the Philippines. The insurrec
tion Is still existing and when It termi
nates further Information will be required
as to the actual condition of affairs before
inaugurating a permanent scheme of civil
government. The report of the commis
sion, now In preparation, will contain In
formation and suggestions which will bit
of value to Congress, and -which I will
transmit as soon as it is completed. As
long as the insurrection continues the
military arm must necessarily be su
prime. But there is no reason why steps
should not be taken from time to time to
inaugurate governments essentially popu
lar In their form as fast as territory is
held or controlled by our troops.
RETURN OF COMMISSION.
To this end I am considering the ad
visability of the return of the commis
sion, or such of the members thereof as
can be Eecured, to aid the existing' au
thorities and facilitate this work through
out the Island. I have believed that re
constructions Should not begin by tho es
tablishment of one central civil govern
ment of all the islands, with Its seat at
Manila, but rather that the work should
be commenced by building up from the
bottom, first establishing municipal gov
ernments and then provincial govern
ments, a central government at least to
follow. Until Congress shall have made
known the formal expression of Its will
I shall use the authority vested in me
by the constitution and statutes to uphold
| the sovereignty of the United States In
those distant Islands and In nil other
places where our flag rightfully floats. I
Fhall put at the disposal of the army and
navy nil the means which the liberality
of Congress and the people have provided
to cause this unprovoked and wasteful in
surrection to erase. If any orders of
mine were required to secure the merciful
conduct of military and naval operations,
, they would not be lacking; but every step
of the progress of our troops has been
marked by a humanity which ha sur
prised even the misguided Insurgents. The
truest kindness to them would be swift
and effective defeat of their present lead
er. . The hour of victory will be the hour
, of clemency and reconstruction.
â¢ No effort will be spared to build up the
watte places desolated by war and by
| long years of misgovernment. We shall
â¢ not. wait for the end of the strife to be
! gin the beneficent work. . We shall con
! tinue, as we have begun, to open the
1 Kflhonla and the churches, to set tho
I courts in operation, to foster Industry and
trade and agriculture, and In every way
I In our power to make these people whom
Providence has brought within our Ju
risdiction feel . that It .Is their liberty
and not our power, their welfare and not
our tin that we are peeking to enhance.

has occurred by reaeon of the peculiar
status which the Hawaiian Islands at
present occupy under the Joint resolution
Of annexation approved July T, 1898.
While by that resolution the republic of
Hawaii as an Independent nation was ex
tinguished, its separate sovereignty de
, etroyed and Its property and possessions
vested in the United States, yet a com
plete establishment for its government
under our system was not effected. While
the municipal laws of tho Islands not en

1 r contrary to the constitution of the
United States or of any of its treaties
; remain in force, yet these laws relate
only to the social and international af
fairs of the lalaAda and do not touch any
j subjects of importance which are of a
i broader national character. For exam
, pie. the Hawaiian republic was divested
of all title to the public lands In the
: islands, and is not only unable to dlspusÂ»
of lands to settlers deslrlr.p to take up
. homepUad sites, but is without power to
give complete tl ; le In casts whore lands
have been entered upon on lea?e or othÂ»*r
' conditions which carry with them th<>
right t.> i 1r- purchaser, lessee, or settler
: to have a full title granted to him upon
I compliance with the conditions prescribed
by law or by his particular agreement of
entry. Questions of doubt and difficulty
have also arisen with reference to the
collection of tonnage tax on vessels com
| Ing from Hawaiian ports; with reference
to the status of Chinese In the Islands,
their entrance and exit therefrom; as to
patents and copyrights; as to the register
; of vessels under the navigation laws; as
i to the necessity of holding elections In
-â lanco with the provisions of the
Hawaiian statutes for the choice of va
rious officers and as to several other mat
, ters of detail touching the Interests both
of the Islands and of the Federal Gov
ernment.
By the resolution of annexation the
President was directed to appoint five
commissioners to recommend to Congress
such legislation concerning the islands as
they should deem necessary or proper.
The commissioners were duly appointed
and after a careful Investigation and
study of the system of laws and govern
ment prevailing there, they prepared a
bill to provide a government under the
title of "The Territory of Hawaii." The
report of the commission, with the bill
which they prepared, was transmitted
by me to Congress on December 6. IS9S,
but the bill atlll awaits final action.
The people of those ("lands are entitled
to the benefits and privileges of our leg

Congress providing for Federal courts In
the Islands, and for a procedure by which

there is no provision of law under which

In some localities the Inhabitants have
met together and voluntarily formed a
municipal organization for the purpose
of local government, adopting the form
of a municipal constitution under which
paid officials have been appointed, and
ordinances creating and regulating a po
lice force, a fire department, a depart
ment of health, and making provision
for the carÂ»Â» of the insane and Indigent
poor and sick, and for public schools
have been passed. These proceedings and
ordinances passed by such municipality
are without statutory authority and have
no Action, except as they are maintain
ed by the popular sentiment of the com
munity.
There Is an entire absence of authority
to provide the ordinary instrument ' '

enterprise or discovery, and under cir

officers be provided. There is practically
no orgsnlisd form of government In the

lished in the year l^'O. when a temporary
\ government was provided for the recently
acquired territory, then known under the
name of Louisiana, It seems to me that It
would be advantageous to confer greater
executive power upon the Governor and
to establish, as was done In the case of
i the Territory of Louisiana, a legislative
council, having power to adopt ordinances

provision of this kind would, be satis

is probable that the area Is too vast and

sitory to make it wise at the present
time to provide for an elective legislative

PORTO RICO.
Organization of a Temporary Govern
ment Urged to Consist Partly
of Porto Rlcais.
# ; O:O:o'C-C â¢Â£ C-p O <Â§â¢ oso Of os Â©
I recommend that legislation to the
fame end be had with reference to the j
government of Porto Rico. The time Is
ripe for the adoption of a temporary form >
of government for this Island; and many j
suggestions made with reference to Alas- j
ka are applicable also to Porto Rico.
The system of civil Jurisprudence now
adopted by the people of this island Is de- j
scribed by competent lawyers who are fa- j
miliar with It as thoroughly modern and \
scientific, so far as it relates to matters.
of internal business, trade, production and
I suclul and private rights in general. The
cities of the island are governed under
i charters which probably require very lit- !
tle or no change. So that with relation to ,
matters of local concern and private ,
rights, It Is not probable that much if any j
legislation Is desirable; but with reference
to public administration and the relations
of the Island to the Federal Government
j there are many matters which are of
! pressing urgency. The same necessity
! exists for legislation on the part of Con
gress to establish Federal courts and
Federal Jurisdiction In the Island as has
been previously pointed out by me with '
reference to Hawaii. Besides the ad
ministration of Justice there are subjects i
of public lands; the control and Improve- j
ment of rivers and harbors; the control
of the waters or streams not navigable,
which, under the Spanish law, belonged to j
the crown of Spain, and have by the I
treaty of cession passed to the United 1
States; the Immigration of people from |
foreign countries; the importation of con- I
tract labor; the Imposition and collection j
of Internal revenue; the application of I
the navigation laws; the regulation of the j
current money; the establishment of post- 1
offices and post roads; the regulation of I
tariff rates on merchandise Imported from
the island into the United States: the es
tablishment of ports of entry and dcliv- j
cry; the regulation of patents and copy- j
rightsâthese, with various other sub- j
jects which rest entirely within the power
of Congress, call for careful consid- I
eration and Immediate action. It must
be borne in mind that since the cession
Porto Rico has been denied the principal
markets she had long enjoyed and our I
tariffs have been continued against her j
products as when she was under Spanish
sovereignty. The markets of Spain are 1
closed to her products except upon terms
to which the commerce of all nations is
subjected. The Island of Cuba, which
used to buy her cattle and tobacco with
out customs duties, now imposes the same I
duties upon these products as from any
other country entering her ports. She |
has therefore lost her free Intercourse '
with Spain and Cuba without any com- 1
pensating benefits in this market. Her
coffee was little known and not In use by
our people, and therefore there was no
demand here for this, one of her chief ;
products. The markets of the United
States should be opened up to her pro
ducts. Our plain duty is to abolish all
customs tariffs between the United States
and Porto Rico and give her products free
access to our markets.
As a result of the hurricane which
swept over Porto Rico on the ISth of
August, 1599. over 100.000 people were re- ]
duced to absolute destitution, without I
homes, and deprived of the necessaries of I
life. To the nppeal of the War Depart
ment the people of the United States made
prompt and generous response. In ad
dition to the private charity of our peo- I
ple*, tha War Department, has expended
for the relief of the distressed 1392,342 63.
which does not Include the cost of trans
portation.
It Is desirable that the government of
the Island under the law of belligerent
right, now maintained through the cxc- !
cutive department, should be superseded ;
by an administration entirely civil In its
nature. For present purposes I recom
mend that Congress pass a law for the
organization of a temporary government,
which shall provide for tho appointment ;
by the President, subject to confirmation
by the Senate, of a Governor and such
other officers as the general administra
tion of the island may require and that
for legislative purposes on subjects of a
local nature not partaking 'of a Federal
character a legislative council, composed
partly of Porto Ricans and partly of cit
izens of the United States, shall be nom
inated and appointed by the President,
subject to confirmation by the Senate,
their acts to bo subject to the approval '
of Congress or the President prior |
to going into effect. In the municipali- i
ties and other local subdivisions I recom
mend that the principle of local self-gov
ernment be applied at once so as to en
able the intelligent citizens of the island
! to participate In their own government
and to learn by practical experience the
duties and requirements of a self-con
tained and a self-governing people. I have
not thought it wise to commit the entire
government of the island to officers se
lected by the people, because I doubt
whether in habits, training and experience
they are such as to fit them to exercise
at once so large a degree of self-govern
ment, but it Is my judgment and expec
tation that they will soon arrive at an
attainment of experience and wisdom
and self-control that will Justify confer
ring upon them a much larger participa
tion in the choice of their Insular officers.
The fundamental requirement for these
people, as for all people. Is education.
Tho free school house is the best pre
ceptor for citizenship. In tho introduc
tion of modern educational methods care,
however, must be exercised that changes i
I be not made too abruptly and that the '
history and racial peculiarities of the In- '
habitants shall be given due weight. Sys- j
terns of education in these new posses
j sions founded on common sense methods,
adapted to existing conditions and look-
Ing to the future movement and Indus
trial advancement of the people will com
mend to them in a peculiarly effective
manner tho blessing of free government.
MOB LfiW.
The love of law and sense, obedience
and submission to the lawfully consti
tuted Judicial tribunals are embedded in
the hearts of our people, and any viola
tion of these sentiments and disregard
of their obligations Justly arouses public
condemnation. The guaranties of life,
liberty and civil rights should be faith
fully upheld, the right of trial by Jury
respected and defended. The rule of the
courts should assure the public of the
prompt trial of those charged with crim
inal offense and upon conviction tho pun
ishment should be commensurate with the
enormity of the crime. Those who. In
disregard of law. and the public peace,
unwilling to await the judgment of court
and Jury, constitute themselves judges
and executioners, should not escape the
severest penalties of their crimes.
What I said in my Inaugural address of
March 4. 1897, I now repeat: "The con
1 stituted authorities must be cheerfully
â  and vigorously upheld. Lyachlngs must
not be tolerated in a great and civ
ilized country like the United States.
Courts, not mobs, must execute the pen
alties of the laws. The preservation of
public order, the right of discussion, the
; Integrity of courts and the orderly admin
istration of Justice must continue forever
the rock of safety upon which our na
tional security rests."
DISTRICT CELEBRATION.
In accordance with the act of Congress
providing for an appropriate national cel
ebration in the year 1000 of the establish
ment of the pent of government In the
District of Columbia. I have appointed a
committee, consisting of the Governors
of all the States and Territories of the
United States, who have been Invited to
assemble In the city of Washington on
the first of December, 1399. which, with
the committees from Congress and the
District of Columbia, is charged with the
proper conduct of the celebration.
MEMORIAL BRIDGE.
Congress at its last session appropriated
$5000 "to enable the chief of engineers of
the army to continue the examinations of
the subject and to make or secure de
signs, calculations and estimates for a
rial bridge from the most conven
ient point of the naval obser. .
ground, or adjacent thereto, acro-^
Potomac River to the most convenient
point of Arlington estate property." In
accordance with the provisions of this act
the chief of engineers has selected four
eminent bridge contractors to submit
plans for a bridge combining the ele
ments of strength and durability and
such architectural embellishments and
ornamentation as will fitly apply
to the dedication, "A memorial to
American patriotism." The designs are
1 M being prepared and as soon as com
pleted will be submitted to Congress
by the Secretary of War. The proposed
bridge would be a convenience to all the
people from every part of the country
who visit the National Cemetery, an or
nament to the capital of the nation, and
forever stand as a monument to Ameri
can patriotism. I do not doubt that Con
gress will give to the enterprise still
further proof of its favor and approval.
CIVIL SERVICE ORDER.
The executive order of May 6, 1896| ex
tending the limits of the classified ser
vice, brought within the operation of the
civil service law and rules nearly all r>f
the executive civil service not previously
classified. Some of the Inclusions were
found wholly Illogical and unsulted to the
work of the several departments. The ap
plication of the rules to many of the
places so Included was found to result In
friction and embarrassment. After long
and very thorough consideration It be
came evident to the heads of the depart
ments responsible for their efficiency that
In order to remove these difficulties and
promote an efficient and harmonious ad
ministration certain amendments were
necessary. These amendments wero pro
mulgated by me In executive order dated
May 29. 1599. The principal purpose of the
order was to except from competitive ex
amination certain places Involving fidu
ciary responsibilities or duties of a strict
ly confidential, sclentiflo or executive
character, which It was thought might
: be filled either by non-competitive
examination or In the discretion of the
appointing officer than by open competi
tion. These places were comparatively
few in number. The order provides for the
filling of a much larger number of places,
mainly In the outside service of the War
Department, by what Is known as the
registration system, under regulations to
be approved by the President, similar to
those which have produced such admir
able results In the navy yard service.
All of the amendments had for their
main object a more efficient and satis
factory administration of the system of
appointments established by the civil ser
vice law. The results attained show that
under their operation the public service
has Improved and that the civil service
system is relieved of many objectionable
features which heretofore subjected it to
Just criticism and the administrative of
ficers to the charge of unbuslness-like
methods in the conduct of public affairs.
It is believed that the merit system has
been greatly strengthened and its perma
nence assured. It will be my constant aim
In the administration of government In
our new possessions to make fitness,
character and merit essential to appoint
ment to office, and to give to the capable
an<l deserving Inhabitants preference In
appointments.
WASHINGTON ANNIVERSARY.
The 14th of December will be the one
hundredth anniversary of the death of
Washington. For a hundred years the
republic has had the priceless advantage
of the lofty standard of character an-1
conduct which he bequeathed to the
American people. It is an Inheritance
which time, instead of wasting, contin
ually Increases and enriches. We may
Justly hope that In the years to como the
benignant influence of tho father of his
country may be even more potent for
good In the century which Is drawing to
a close. I have been gled.to learn that In
many parts of the country the people will
fittingly observe this historic anniversary.
CONGRESS' OPPORTUNITIES
Presented to this Congress are great
opportunities. With them come great re
sponsibilities. The power confided to us
Increases the weight of our obligations to
tho people, and we must be profoundly
sensitive of them as we contemplate the
new and grave problems which confront
us. Aiming only at the public good, we
caainot err. A right interpretation of tho
p. 1 ple'4 will and of duty cannot fail to
Insure wise measures for the welfare of
the Islands which have come under the
authority of the I'nited States and inure
to the common interest and lasting honor
of our country.
Never has this nation had more abund
ant cause than during the past year for
thankfulness to God for manifold bless
ings and mercies, for which we make
reverent acknowledgment.

VARIED COMMENT OF
THE ENGLISH PRESS
LONDON, Dec. 6.â A1l the morning
papers have editorials on President Mc-
Klnley's message to Congress. The Dally
Telegraph says: "What differentiates
the present from preceding messages Is
its all but formal admission that the
United States have been drawn into the
eddies of Eastern politics. It Is the Far
East which is the real reason for this par
tial abandonment of Monroeism. So far
as Great Britain Is concerned there is no
apprehension, but rather unqualified satis
faction at the new departure."
The- Daily Mall says: "Commercial ex
pansion is the dominant note of the mes
sage. Shipping subsidies are plainly hint
ed at. If Congress carries these into ef
rect British shipowners and shipping
linns will have to break through all
rings and enter upon a new epoch of eu
terprlse."

GALENA LEDGE FOUND
IN THE KLONDIKE

Vein Showing Free Gold Even
to the Naked Eye.
VICTORIA, B. c.. Dec. 6.â The steamer
Tees, which arrived this evening from
Skaguny, Included among her passengers
John C Russell, who left the Klondike
capital on November 9th in company with
two companions. Near Thistle Creek the
two broke through the Ice and Russell
had a narrow escape from death. He was
saved by his companions, who had i
scrambled out and dragged him from the
Icy water.
According to Russell quite a number of i
people, who have been going to Oawson
over tho Ice, have been drowned. He
heard of a number of accidents and five
drownlngs came under his observation.
He was. however, unable to get the
names or find out anything concerning
the unfortunates who lost their lives.
Mr. Russell tells of a new danger which
threatens the miners who are now work
ing at Dawson. With the introduction of
the thawing machines, tunnels are put in
speedily and in few cases is thÂ« earth
shored up with timbers, the minors rely
ing on the frost to solidify and hold the
earth above in position.
With the coming of the thaw there were
a number of cave-Ins and many accidents
occurred. There were at least three
deaths because of this. He did not make
any note of the victims and was unable
to recall their names. Just before he left
a census of Dawson was taken, showing
4000 people there.
A big quartz llnd has been made, says
Mr. Russell, at the back of Bonanza
Creek. The property was bonded early In
November to Eastern capitalists for
JSO.OOO.
The Tees also brought news of a big
quarts strike on Oundas Island. A I.
C Isle, near Port Simpson. A. 8. Aotell
and H. C. Robertson have found a ledge
of galena thirty-two feet wide, and they
are of the opinion that there Is millions

There Is Borne anxiety for the steamer

never characterized The

Dependable drugs at
reasonable prices have made
our business grow from one

We were the first to cut
the price of patent medi-

patent medicines at cut
prices, saving medicine buy-

So it is with our prescrip-

The character of the

the cost of each prescrip-

NEW YOKK. Dec 5 -A cable tr tbe Sun
from Pretoria via Lourenzo Marquez, Dec. 2,
says : All was quiet at Kin)b?r!ey yesterday.
Ir) regard to the Modder F^iver fight General
Cronje reports that tr;e engagement com

till 7 o'clcc^ in the ever)ing, when t'ne British;

LA feeling of
anxiety and Irritation was In the
a!r last evening at thÂ« clubs:,
hotels, thtaters and wherever mtn
were congregated. There was but
one exclamation. "When will they allow
news to come through?" This feeling is
rÂ«'fl>ctÂ«d in the petulant criticisms of tne
work of the censor which art- to be found
in tho columns of several of the great
I^ndnn dailies. This absolute silence at
a Hmo wryn tho next blow is about to be
i. "â¢ er*-<l,a blow which is likely to be
vital to the fortunes of thÂ»Â» campalen. is
most hard to b<-ar. What makes the MiJÂ«
rwnse more 'ilftlrult t" endure is the
knnwlÂ«Â»Â«Jgo th.it it is caused, not by the
natural circumstances Â«>f the case, but
by the deliberate determination of the
military authorities. It in fully appro
rial ed that any moment may bring news
of the RrÂ«"atrst Importance.
From Natal conic* word that the Hoers
hav#Â» retired frcm Weenrn. southeast of
fnlor.so. It look* as if a part of Sir
Francis Clery's division had been de
tached to mukc a wide detour on thÂ«
f^Â«t of Frcre Station. The flret result Of
such movemeot will bo to drive any out
lying force of Boers across the Rlau
tvakra*6 River. Its Fubsequent object
would b<* to work around so as to menace
the enemy's position at Colcnso from the
east.
General Bulier must now have available
for operation for forcing Tugela River
nearly 24.000 men. It must not neces
sarily be assumed that all will be con
cÂ«*ntratÂ«Â»d at Colenso. General Bulier may
attempt what Methuen paid was lmposri
ble for him. to outflank the enemy. lie
will feint at many places, but the actual
IÂ»olnt at which he roasea may be thit at
which he finds the emmy the least
Ftror.g. This would account for the ex
treme pecr?cy observed as to movements
of the British troops. Far more de
pends on the p&ssage of Tuge'.a River
than depended en that of Modder River.
General Jcubert 1* reported to nave
Ftrcngthen<Â»d both his right and left
flanks in the preparation for tactics like
thesa. but It by no means follows that
h* would ho able to frustrate them. The
Boer pisltlt n on the Tupela has been
madÂ« exv-eedmirly strong as again?: any
front attack, while the character of tile
Country lo this rÂ»Â»Rinn largely helps Jou
!)Â«Â«rt's dispositions. The Boers are reptirt
ed to be m very great numbers at tlrob
lers Kloof and eUewher* around Coler.so.
From a brltish point of view it is hoped
that the Boera will star.d an.l await at

two milÂ«*Â» Â«Jong th* course of the Tugela
Urn result w<-uld be something like guer
rilla warfare.
The Â«J<"lay which has occurred In the
British advance can not only be explained
by General BulW* desire to get up an
overwhelming number of batteries, but
alÂ»Â«rÂ» by rarefully planned and extensive
movement! whereby the IJoers' position

An ur.'-or.flrmrd report njn that (Jen

bridjre at Frere had been sufficiently re
ralred on that date.
The Boers are Mid to be confident of

every kind will have to be. brought from
LX' Aar to Kimberley before any advance
toward the east can begin. This is a
matter of wÂ»-fk.s, not of days.
It seems likely that ttM advance from
Kimberley will be made in conjunction
with an advance of General Caen from
tiif Siromberg district. This advance on
Woemfonteln from Kimberley will with
draw the Free State invaders from Cape
Colony. Hemmed on the Hank by General
Methuen they will retire north, closely
followed by General Gatacre.
Similarly the relief of Ladyamlth will
be the beginning of the Transvaal cam
paign. Whether the main lint- of invasion
will be continued through Natal remains
to be seen. Natal operations .viii be di
rected mainly against the Transvaal
Boers. It Is quite possible that thÂ» defeat
of General Joubert's force prill be fol
lowed by the invaÂ«ion of the Transvaal,
not from the Orange Free State, as orig
inally intended, but from Natal.

LONDON. Dec. 6.â The Daily Telegraph
publishes this dispatch from us special
correspondent:
MODDER RIVER. Thursday afternoon.
Nov. 30.â Lord Methuens troops are at
rest here for a few days after their tre
mendous exertions recently. During the
tight on Tuesday the enemy's lire was
simply terrific throughout the day. Two
of our batteries the Eighteenth and the
SÂ«venty-flfthâ bore the brunt of the battle
and discharged no fewer than 2000 rounds,
the Seventy-fifth shelling the town all day
at a range of 1200 yards and at last having
to retire for want of ammunition. Just
before they withdrew a tremendous flro
was concentrated on them by the Boers.
Major Lindsay and Captain Ferrall were
wounded and two men were killed and
eleven wounded.
Twenty-five horses were lost and offi
cers' chargers had to be used to bring the
battery back. Major Lindsay and Captain
Ferrail had to walk out of action. One
gallant driver, though shot through the
lung, drove his gun out. The Maxim de
tachment of the Scots Guard, under Lieu
tenant Elweys, was completely wiped out
when they advanced to attack the en
emy's trenches. So well hidden were the
Boers that our men, though under their
fire, could not se<- them. Lieutenant
Thorpe crossed the river on the left Hank
with a company of Argyle and Sutherland
Highlanders and held his position until
the brigade could cross. The Highlanders*
loss wr.s very severe. They had to move
across to support our left, and as soon as
they showed themselves they were mowed
down. Regardless of the fusillade, how
ever, they went across in a quiet and
leisurely manner.
. am George Nugent cantered about
with orders on a while pony, drawing a
tremendous !ire from the snemy, but he
llously escaped unhurt. !>>rd
Methoen's original lntentiit, \\as to take
the town with the bayonet after dark, t-'it

We communicated with Kimberley by
means of a searchlight last night. The
bridge over the Modder was destroyed by

putting up their own. The railway was
Uir.iaged. but the engineers repaired
it in wonderfully Â«juick time.

MURDERS WIFE

Horrifying Crime of Ed
Milllken.
ENDS HIS OWN LIFE ALSO
TERRIBLE TRAGEDY ENACTED
NEAR BAKERSFIELD.
Father. Mother and Little Boy Found
Dead Together and No Reason
for the Deed
Known.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERBFIELD. Dec. â fifâ The dead and
horribly mutilated bodies- of Ed Mlillken.
his wife and five-year-old son were found
yesterday at their home, twenty-three
miles northwest of here, on the Kern
County Land Company's Poso Ranch.
Circumstances point to the conclusion
that the dead man was the perpetrator of
the ghastly deed.
Milllken was In the employ of the Kern
County I. and Company as fence rider and
his wile attended to one of the company's
pumps near their home Milllken had not

and not being at his post Mon
day morning nor yesterday morn
ing one of the men at the p ....
Ranch neadquartesr was sent three miles
away to ascertain what was th. matter.
On entering the house the man was horri-
Bed to tiinl the bloody corpses of Mil
liken and his family. Milllkens body and
that of the boy were lying on the sofa,
and the wife was stretched on the Kot
with one foot touching the leg of the sofa.
Milllken had been shot twice in the
breast, the boy's throat was slashed from
ear to ear. and the wife's throat was also
frightfully cut. in addition to which she
had been shot beside the nose. In one of
Milliken's hands was a 3S-callber pistol
and In the other a large skinning knife.
The chambers of th- pistol were empty
and the knife reeking with blood.
It Is not known Just when the tragedy
occurred. It Is surmised that It took place
either Just at supper time Sunday even
ing or at breakfast Monday morning, for
the meal was on the table ready for eat
ing. The situation of everything
about the house did not show that there
had been any scuffle. The indications
were thai the man tirst shot the wife and
failing to kill her finished the act by cut
ting her throat. He then turned and dis
patched the hoy. and followed It up by
ending his own life. Such was the verdict
of the Coroner's jury.
Milliken was about thirty years of an
and came to this county with his wife
and boy about two years ago from Craw
ford. Neb. Soon after arriving here he
went to work for the Kern County l..and
Company. He was reputed to be sober
and industrious and in no financial
trouble. Ills relations with his family
were supposed to be agreeable. The wife
Was â  hard-working woman and made a
salary by attending the pumps. Mllliken
was liked by all his fellow laborers. The
cause of the tragedy is a profound mys
tery.
Fence-riding Is a lonely and arduous
occupation, and It Is surmised that Milll
ken's mind gave way, as have those of
many another line rider, and his mania
took a homicidal turn. The weapons he
used were only such as he might be ex
pected to carry in his occupation, and his
resolution was probably taken on the spur
of the moment without ulterior motive.

DOUBTFUL OF
ENGLAND'S FUTURE
Dr. Ross Says Morals
Have Retrograded.
Special Dispatch to Tl:Â» Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Deo. 5-
Dr. Edward a. Boâ . head of the econom
ics department in Stanford, and who re
cently returned from a year's study
abroad, lectured before the students to
night on "Imperialism in England."
In comparing the English people with
ourselves socially, the speaker said that
they were more conscientious, humane
and fonder of conventionality than the
Americans. Economically they were the
most dependent people In the world, as
two-thirds of their food and clothing sup
plies bad to come across the sea. The
dominant Idea among the English people,
he said. Is that the final disposition of the
planet is now being made and that to I**
the rulers of the world they must get the
major portion of its surface. This idea
has swept England from her moorings and
bean her farther each year Into the
depths of imperialism. This policy whs
also bolstered up by the nobility, who
needed the 18,000 places provided by the
civil service in India to preserve their sons
from the trades.
"In order to maintain this policy." said
the speaker, "England starved her schools

ORGANIZED FOR PROGRESS.
UJ ITH the nnion of the various improvement
/ clul'S of the city in one association for the
purpose of working more , effectively for
progress a new and potent factor has been introduced
into the campaicn fur municipal improvement now
going on. The new organization is in itself an im
provement upon past conditions and give? promise
of achieving great results for the public good.
In the mass meeting which followed the organiza
tion of the Central Club the popular sentiment in
favor of progress and improvement vras abundantly
manifest. The speakers of the evening dealt in de
tail with every issue that is to be voted upon at the
coming elections, and upon each point had the sym
pathies of the audience with them. It is to be noted,
moreover, that the gathering was a thoroughly repre
sentative one. and may be justly considered to have
expressed the sentiment of the whole progressive ele
ment of the community.
As the force of the silurian opposition to the new
movement is directed mainly against the proposals
for extending and improving the park system, it
was natural the speakers should leal moTe particu
larly with that me. The arguments for it were
clearly and strongly presented and were fully appre
ciated by the assembly. The proposed new school
buildings, sewers and hospitals arc of course needed,
but they are not more requisite than the park exten
sions, nor will they serve for the benefit of a larger
number of the people.
With the impulse given by this meeting to the
movement toward popular education on the subject
it is reasonable to expect' the campaign of education
will go briskly on. The various improvement club*
have already attested their value to the districts which
they serve. They have accomplished many notable
f accesses in the special lines of work they have un
dertaken, and now that they are banded together for
this greater work there can be no doubt their efforts
will result in victory. The whole work, however,
nm<t not be left to the association. Every citizen is
concerned in the measures proposed, and each in pro
portion to his energies and opportunities should aid
in the campaign. It is to be. borne in mind that a
two-thirds vote in favor of the improvements will be
necessary to carry them.- Let all progressive citizens
therefore join in the work and help to make success
certain.
School Director Kemp prefers evidently to be
looked upon as a city chump ;vho let a golden oppor

ThjE MESSAGE.
THE great length of the President's message
niakfs its rcvie^- in one article impossible.
The matters in it of firÂ«t interest relate to the
- that have arisen in the Spanish war, and to the
proposed financial legislation by Congress. The
President takes the view, which The Call has con
â¢y urged, that now is the time for such legisla
tion He says the present situation is the most fit
ting time to make adequate provision to insure the
continuance of the gold standard, that public confi
dence may be promoted in the ability and purpose of
the Government to meet all of its obligations in the
mrney recognized by the civilized world as the best
He admits that while, "happily, we are not at
Dt compelled to resort to loans to suocly gold,
it has been done in the past and may have to be done
In the future, and it behooves us, therefore, to pro
vide the Ikm means to meef the emergency when it
. and the best meant are thoÂ«e which are the
â¢ certain and economical Those now authorized
j have neither the virtue of directness nor economy."
He then recommends the measures proposed for
financial reform, which have been so recently dis
cussed in detail in these columns. Incident to his dis
cussion of finance occurs a recommendation for ex
tension pf the protective policy of the Government to
the restoration of American shipping. The reasons
Mich policy have accumulated during the past
year, in which a less percentage of our commerce
was carried in American bottoms than ever before.
His first reference to the change produced by the
Spanish war contains what may be an inadvertence,
â¢ or something intended to be interpreted by what fol-
I lows further on. In discussing our representation at
! the Paris Exposition the message says: "I am in
formed by our Commissioner General that we shall
have in the American sections at Paris over 7000 ex
hibitors, from every State in our country â a num
ber ten times as sreat as at Vienna in 1573. six times
U great as at Paris in 1878, and four times as many
as at Paris in iÃ3q. This statement does not include
exhibits from either Cuba, Porto Rico or Hawaii,
for which arrangements have been' made."
The inclusion of Cuba with the other annexed pos
nd unexplained, will not tend to
piacate the rising resentment of the masses in that
inland. The next reference to Cuba iÂ« to the effect
that the withdrawal of Spain from thnt island left it
held by the United Stitos in tru<t for the inhabitants,
with such government provided by the executive.
ing the execution of the pledge to leave the gov
ernment and control of the island to its people, which
>c sacredly kept." The President then
refers to tile ties which bind Cuba to us as of singular
intimacy and strength, and says that "whether I
(hall be organic or conventional the destinies of
Cuba are in some rightful form and manner irre
vocably linked with our own. but how and how far
is for the future to determine in the ripeness of
events." After saying that we must see to it tint
i* a reality and not a name, other qualifi
cations follow to the effect that free Cuba must not
be a "hasty experiment." a "loosely framed common
wealth to face the vicissitudes which too often atten-1
states whose natural wealth and abundant resources
â â¢set. by the incongruities of their political organ
". ' N*o.vhere does the message use the terms
r.ment or independence for Cuba, which
are "the sacred pledge" of this Government, though
there is a vague mention of a representative conven
lh a general system of independent
:i-l. after a long list of other
things have been accomplished.
While this part of the message is tentative, vague
â¢ .egative, .1 careful analysis discloses the weight
of the Presidential indorsement thrown in the scale
tor the retention of the is'and by the United States.
The conditions precedent to a representative con
vention are such as imply the adoption of the
Fabian policy, of waiting until the Cuban aspiration
for that independence which Congress declared was
already and of right oug-ht to be theirs shall hay;
lieen extinguished in discouragement and delay. The
added recommendation that the products of Cuba
shall have free acce-s to our markets, to the extent
â  ttteh products of other West Indian islands are
admitted free by reciprocity, is in line with such
analysis, and will cause certain foreboding among
our agricultural and horticultural producers.
The message puts our military force in the Philip
pines at 2051 offrcrs nnd 63,483 men; in Cuba at
JU4 â¢ â¢ men; in Pono Rico at 87
â¢rs and 2555 men; in Hawaii 12 officers and 453
men. a total army of 80.071 required in what are
:':,er on referred to as '^ur island possessions."
In reference to the Philippines an overlooked fact
is recalled by the message. It says that the treaty
! of Paris provided "that the civil rights and political
statue of the native inhabitants of the territory so
ceded to the United States should be determined by
the Congress of the United States." It will be seen
â¢that under 'this provision Congress is competent to
j give qualified and progressive independence to the
j people of those islands; but the President proceed",
to apparently conclude the polic* eJ>. this Government
ir. a lons statement of events in the islands: the
righteousness of the war of conquest is asserted, and
the Pre-ident refrains from making any recommenda
tion to Congress, and seems to indicate clearly that
it shall reserve or abdicate its function of fixing the
civil rights and political status of the natives, and
leave that in his hands. The celebrated agreement
â¢vith the Sultan of Sulu is handled gingerly. The.
menage admit * that the Sultan acknowledges the
-eignty of the United States, is pa id a salary of
$760 a month, and that the treaty provides that any
Â«lave in the Sulus shall have the right to purchase
hit freedom "by paying his master the usual market
value." The President ajrs: "I have ratified this
agreement, subject to the action of Congress, an.l
with the reservation, which I have directed shall be
conveyed to the Sultan of Jolo. that this agreement
is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give
consent to the existence of slavery in the Sulu ar
chipelago" As it does not abolish slavery, but per
mit 1 - its existence, it is difficult to see that this reser
vation amounts to anything.
With some voluptuous references to the great
wealth of the islands and our beneficent presence
there the rafajttl is dismissed, in no more satisfac
tory form than it was before. Congress is urged to
I Something for tfawatt, if only to erect there a
Federal judicial district, through which access may
be had to the courts of the United States.
Those who expected any recommendation of the
extension of our constitutional system and its guar
antees, the projection of republican government to
what are frequently called "our new possessions,"
will be disappointed.
HtheWeatures of the message, with an important
bearing on domestic matters, will await further
reference.
If the remainder of the Boers are all like General
Joobeti it is easy to see the finish of the British in
South Africa. No less than four times in as many
weeks the commander in chief of the burghers has
been reported dead again.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1899.
OUR INTERESTS fIT WASHINGTON*
S^ ALIFORXIA'S interests at Washington will be
l^ guarded by a delegation which on the whole
is one of the strongest we have ever had at the
national capital. We have not yet learned the value
of electing the same Representatives term after term
to as to have men of experience as well as of natural
ability in the House, but we have improved upon the
past, and in this Congress will have several members
who have long been in the service and have acquireJ
the friendship and the favor of delegates from other
States upon whom they can rely for assistance in
promoting California measures.
In interviews published in The Call yesterday the
Representatives from the State presented briefly some
of the measures of local interest they hope to be able
to carry successfully. Mr. Loud will endeavor to
bring about the removal of Blo3som and Anita
' rocks, which are the only serious impediment to
navigation in San Francisco harbor, and to procure
lent appropriations for the early completion of
the lonp-desired Federal building in this city; Mr.
K.ihn will give a large part of his energies to the
various questions of commerce which will arise dur
| ing the session and will be among the most zealous
in supporting a bill for the rehabilitation of our mer
! chant marine; Mr. Barham purposes to make a fight
| for immediate action on the Nicaragua canal bill, and
to that end will move to abolish the new commission
that has been appointed to reinvestigate the subject,
j it being his opinion as well as that of other earnest
| acrocates of the canal that we have had commissions
enough and it is now time to act; Mr. Waters' ef
i forts will be directed toward hastening the completion
j of the work at San Pedro harbor, and he will also
j support the movement to provide a Federal system
of irrigation for our arid lands; Mr. de Viries will
carry on the fight of the mining men for the passage
of what is known as the "California mineral lands
bill," and will also favor legislation for the protec
tion of forests; Mr. Needham will seek to obtain
appropriations needed to complete the jetty at San
Diego harbor and also a quarantine stationâ he is
also largely interested in Indian education and in the
irrigation of arid lands and will give much attention
to those subjects;' Mr. Metcalf will be among the
most active in upholding local interests during the
s-csion, and among other measures of importance to
the State will endeavor to obtain extensive appropria
r improvements at Mare Island.
It will be seen from these statements that our Con
gressmen have not gone to Washington neglectful of
the interests of the State. Each has some measure of
local advantage to urge upon the House so far as it
isible to do so. There are reasons for believing
that the work of the delegation so far as these strictly
Californian interests are at issue will be harmonious.
No party questions are involved in them, and for
their attainment the entire delegation should work
together.
c PROSPECTIVE IMPROVEMENT.
EX GENERAL feeling of gratification followed the
I V announcement of the sale of the entire Baldwin
Hotel site to a capitalist who can be reasonably
expected to erect thereon a building that will be an
ornament to the city and worthy of the conspicuous
position the site occupies on our main thoroughfare.
Real estate transfer! of such nature as this are al
ways more or less matters of public concern. When
the Baldwin Hotel burned down there was left in the
aspect of the city a gap that made the face of the
town look as if it had a tooth knocked out. The
fragments of the oH structure which were permitted
to remain so long after the fire were eyesores and
to some extent a menace. Then followed the prob
ability that the lite would be piven over for years
to cheap and comparatively worthless structures, and
that one of the finest corners in the city would be
sacrificed to petty trade and made something like a
â ii^i/race to the municipality.
All such fear* are now happily over. In the pos
session of Mr. Flood the Bfoperty will soon be put
to right use. What manner of structure he will erect
is of course for him to determine. The public is
satisfied in the assurance that it will be a building
which will add to the architectural magnificence of
the city. The transfer of the property conies at a
time when a spirit of improvement and enterprise is
everywhere felt, and there are good reasons for
hoping the new owner will endeavor to raUe upon it
a structure that will stand as typical of the movement
which marks the new era in our municipal develop
ment.
Representative Corliss of Michigan is about to re

MAKING READY
FOR SANTA FE
FREIGHT CARS
How They Will Reach
the City.
The busy life of the water front will
receive another marked boom when the
Santa Fe freight traffic directly reaches
San Francisco early next year. There
will be a big: transformation in the ap
pearance of the front in the neighborhood
of Main-Btreet wharf, where the Santa Fc
freight terminus has been located, and
the life of a big freight depot will be
strung daily by scores of trucks along
south-of-Markct streets.
The Santa Fe authorities and the Har
bor Commissioners are driving the work
of getting the wharves and docks as
signed to the company ready for use, and
for several days the work of clearing the
depot block bounded by Bryant, Spear,
Main and Harrison streets of building-*,
â grading for tracks and getting the.
freight depot building Into shape has
gone rapidly on.
The Santa Fe freight cars are not to be
brought from the bay terminus at Point
Richmond to the city on big ferry-boats
like the Thoroughfare and Transit of the
Southern Pacific system. Instead, "car
floats," or big barges with cartracks laid
on them and hauled by strong tugboats
will be used. Such car floats are used
elsewhere, but will be new out here. Two
floats and one tugboat will be ready for
work when the line is ready. The floats
will be long and narrow, with a length of
240 feet. Each will have three tracks, the
outer ones with a capacity of six cars and
the center one of five.
The work of remodeling the wharf and
building the Blip for the floats is well
along. The tugboat will shove a float
into a slip, where an apron 100 feet long
will connect with the front end of the
float and over which a yard engine will
pass the cars. Two tracks will lead from
the slip across Bryant street to the depot
block.
On this block the old rookeries and
water-front grog shops have all disap
peared. The only building left standing
is a big two-story brick warehouse 137 by
275 feet in size on the corner of Harrison
and Spear streets, and out of this the
freight depot building is now being made.
Big doors are being broken into the sides,
where trucks will receive and deliver
freight. Four tracks will run the length
of the ground floor, with a narrow plat
form along the center and a broad one
along each side.
It has been supposed along the front
that the whole block would be roofed, but
for the present no buidlngs will be erected
and the rest of the space in the block,
which is 275 by 560 feet in size, will be
largely tilled with sidetracks along which
team tracks will run and from which
much unloading and loading of cars will
be done. There will also be a derrick
track, where heavy goods may be handled
with a derrick.
This Is the extent and style of the San
ta Fe freight terminal now. The company
also owns a fragment of the water front
'block on the corner of Harrison and Spear
streets, but It will not be utilized until oc
casion requires. The. Harbor Commis
sioners do not expect that the company
will ever utilize the China Basin conces
sion. This one block looks small for a
transcontinental freight terminus when
compared with the Southern Pacific yard*,
but whatever the Santa Fe people expect
to do in the future about more room when
It is needed they are keeping to them
selves.
The Santa Fe people now want to make
Main street wharf their ocean steamship
terminal as well. They have asked the
Harbor Commission to roof the entire
wharf., which Is 563 feet In length, and to
give them Its exclusive use. The matter
Is still under consideration, bat will prob
ably be done. ThÂ« company wants to run
tracks from its depot grounds alone the
length of this wharf, which would- bo
bringing: ship and car together in an ex
cÂ«ptionnlly convenient way. This shows
that the- Santa F*- expects to do a large
. trans- Pacific business with Its steamers
from this port. If it gets the Main street
wharf its carloads of cotton can be
quickly placed at a steamer's side and Its
shiploads of tea and silk loaoV.l directly
Into ear9,_jvhich will h* crossing the bay
after a f?w minutes' switching.
â When the Santa Fe starts its freight
business In the city according to the**
plans two loner wharves and one dock and
half of another, which â¢ are now daily
crowded with vessels, will he subtracts
from the wator front facilities, already
Inadequate to the general demand for
room.
SCOTT WORE A FALSE
MUSTACHE THAT NIGHT
PASSED COUNTERFEIT HALVES
ON CONDUCTORS.
Had Not Toiled. Neither Had He
Spun, for the Past Two Years,
and Has a Bad Brother.
Frank Scott, accused of paxslng coun
terfeit half-dollars upon conductors of
the Sutter street cars, was held yesterday
afternoon by United States Court Com
missioner Heacock to answer before tae
Federal Grand Jury.
Scott was positively identified by three
car conductors as the man who passed tne
counterfeit half-dollars upon them on tne
night of November IS. They identified
him by his light clothes, a scar on his
fare and a gold ring with a red setting
that he wore. The only variation was tlie
fact that the prlnoner was cl<*an-Pha\ Â»-il
vrlien arrested, while he wore a light mus
tache on the night of the 18th.
His barber ajid a, man who keeps a cigar
stand on the corner of Kearny and Pine
streets testified yesterday that Scott had
been clean-shaved for live months.
Judge Heacoek was of the impression
that tho prisoner wore a false mustache
on the night In question. The fact tnat
Scott had not worked for two years past
ainl had no visible means of support and
the further fact that his brother, Charles
Scott, has been held to answer for pac
ing :i gilded cent piece as a ten-dollar coin
added weight to the false mustache the
ory.

MRS. JANE STANFORD

CONFIRMS THE REPORTS OF
THE BIG STOCK SALE.
Pacific Improvement Deal May Not
Be Consummated for a Year Yet.
A Hitch in the Price.
Mrs. Jane Stanford returned to the city
yesterday morning, after an extended ab
sence in Europe and the East. She re
turns in excellent 'health, having been
nruch benefited by the change of scene
and climate that she has experienced
during her trip.
The sale of her interests in the Southern
Pacific Company is now an old story, but
there may be a new one soon about her
holdings in the Pacific Improvement Com
pany, concerning the sale of which Mrs.
Stanford yesterday admitted there had
been some talk, though nothing definite
ha* yet been arranged
Charles Lathrop and Russell H. Wilson,
Mrs Stanford's direct-. rs In the Southern
Pacific i 'â â mpany, have both sent In their
resignations. That of Mr. Lathrop has
already been accepted and Mr. Wilson's
will also be in the very near future
Mrs. Stanford said yesterday that It
may be a year before ehe and the
Crockers sell out their interests in the
Pacific Improvement Company. They are
willing to sell now. but the point on
which the negotiations hitch is the price
to be received, and it may be some time
before both parties to the deal succeed in
arriving at a figure satisfactory to all
concerned.
Though Mrs. Stanford would say noth
ing concerning the price that she and the
Â« ro< ;5 ers demam! for their holdings In the
Pacific Improvement Company, it is gen
erally reported that the figure Is $8,000,000

THE ADVANCE OF POLYGAMY.
(The Call does not hold Itaeir responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but pre
sents them fur whatever value they may have
as communications of general interest.)
To the Editor of The Call: Tour re
porter missed some of the spirit and
letter of the remarks made by Rev. Ben
jamin Fay Mills on the case of Brigham
Roberts.
Mr. Mills said that in its day polygamy
was a great moral advance upon the pro
miscuous association which must have
preceded it. but that monogamy was a
still greater moral advance on polygamy,
since it placed the sanctity of the home
upon a still higher foundation.
Those who have, read Lecky's chapter
on monogamy in his "History of Morals"
will at once appreciate the full forco of
the preacher's reference to the subject.

contention. It will also be maintained that
the accused is being persecuted by hi*

SCOTT & BOWXE. Ckmist*, NewTsriLROBERTS PLEADS HIS OWN
CASE BEFORE THE HOUSE
By a Vote of 302 to 30 the Polygamist Is Denied
Seat Pending an Investigation of
Charges Against Him.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6-After an
Interesting debate of three
hourÂ» the House to-day, by a
vote of 302 to SO. adopted the
resolution offered toy Taylor of
Ohio yesterday for the appointment of a
tpecial committee, to Investigate the
â¢ hargÂ«s against Hrigh&m 11 Roberts, the
Mormon Represent atlve-clect from Utah.
Previously the House had rejects a
robotitttte resolution offered by Richard
t<">n. the leader of the minority, to allow
Robert* to be swou in and to w nd the
whole cape to the Judiciary Committe-*.
This substitute resolution, however, by
no means commanded the full, Demo
cratic strength. Only fifty-seven men-
Tern voted for It. Of the thirty who then
voted against the Taylor resolution, all
*frf Democrats except two. Ixiud. a
<"al:fornia Republican, and Newlanda, a
Hilvcrlte from Nevada.
n.v the tÂ»*rms of the resolution Roberts
if not only excluded from all participa
tion In the proceedings of the House until
the committee reports and the House
padres upon his case, but he la denied a
feat in the hall. Whether this will be in
terpreted to deny him admission within
the chamber pending the disposition of
his case iÂ» yot to be decided.
The reading of the President's message
â â  as completely overshadowed by the
dramatic proceedings which resulted In
the action of the House to-day. Th-* gal
lerira were thronged with spectators,
mostly women, who sat patiently through
the three weary hours that preceded the
debate and then waited on three hours
more until it was concluded. The most
remarkable feat of the debate was tho
f;ict that Roberta' presentation of his own
Udo of the <"iLÂ«e. which lasted almost an
hour, became to absorbing that h>Â» won
thÂ«Â» sympathy of many of those in tho
i. â  :.. Â» and wits several times ehowered
with applause. It was evident that he
r. allzej that tho Houte was t.verwhelm-
Incty against him. and at times he *poke
li< roÂ«ly and deflantly.
Taylor conducted the case upon his
tldo. Richardson championed his resolu
tion. _
Purir.g the debate Orosvenor (R.) of
( >hio arose to indignantly repel an In
t-lnuatlou of Roberts that the President
Â».ad knowingly appointed men guilty of
polygamy to Federal otllces in Utan.
At 12 o'clock Speaker Henderson called
the members to *.nier. riatt of Connecti

reported that thut duty had beÂ«-n per

j after the passage of the Edmunds act
! and irrespective of whether he had since
] cohabited with a plural wife, he w.ia
! guilty of polygamy if he still maintained
the relation of husband to more than one
wife. Referring again to the two procla
mations of amnesty, he argued that the
claimant was in no better position than
he would have, been had no such procia
i matlon been issued. Hut higher than the
I civil law was a law of civilization which
demanded that one so tainted should be
excluded. There were precedents for such
an appeal to the higher law.
H. cited the case of Whittemore. who
had been guilty of Belling cadetships and
who up. >n his appearance at the bar of
the House wu*. rejected as until to alt In
the House. The power and the right were
Inherent, said Taylor. It was only a ques
tion of propriety." of wisdom and of prece
dent. In all his investigation and Btudy
; of precedents. Taylor said, he had failed
to rind a single case where the House had
hesitated to assert upon proper occasion
its right to halt a member at the bar
when his qu.iliilcattons for a seat were
quostluned. He quoted extenslvoly from
"MeCreary on Elections" In support of his
argument. He reviewed the cases of
PrÂ«Â»ctor Knott. Boyd Winchester and
John M. Rice of Kentucky, who had been
FtoppeJ at the bar of the House on the
ground that they were disqualified be
cause they had been disloyal.
"We are told." Mid Taylor, In conclu
sion, his voice ringing out clearly, "that
we. are about to create an unhappy prece
dent. Why. Mr. Speaker, we are doing
this In the open ga.ze of the whole world,
not in a cloistered court. We arc. the ser
vants of the people, empowered to do the
right as we see it. The public eye Is upon
us. the public conscience quickens us. In
that presence we can d i no wrong if we
do but obey it."
Taylor's concluding words were greeted
with a storm of applause, both from the
flixir and the galleries.
Richardson; the minority loader, fol
' lowed T;tylor. He did not intend, ho said,
to discuss the merits of the ease. The
question In Issue was as to whether the
Representative-elect. Roberts, had a
prima fnolo right to his seat. He was
not willing to reject a Representative
elect who appeared at the bar of the
House with his credentials in duo form.
If he were denied admission a precedent
would be created which would rise to
plague the House in years to comÂ©. The
only constitutional objection raised
ugainst thfi member-elect related to his
naturaJizatlon, and that, Richardson as
serted, would not hold. He defied the
other sldÂ« to produce a single precedent
whore objection was raised to tho ad
ministration of the oath except on con
stitutional grounds. The precedents cited
were made during the war and were not
ito be relied on. In thoso days the con
stitution was written with the sword.
They had all been since overruled after
the passions [lowing the war had eub
slde<i. Richardson declared that the m!
nority wan in no wise bound by his do
sttion. Ho spoke for himself alone. He
was willing to fay that if the charges
against the member-elect were proved be
should favor his expulsion.
"If there is one thing the American peo
ple are a unit upon." ho said, "it is that
the American home shall be preserved in
all its loveliness, sweetness and purity."
(.Applause.*
"Hut." he proceeded, "it Is not wise to
permit our Judgment to be warped by
public clamor. To do so amounts to con
demnation without trial."
Richardson then brought forward sev
eral precedtjus in support of his posi
tion. The first was that of George Q.
Cannon, who appe-ared in the House as a
delegate-Â«*ieot from tab In 1*7;: Cannon
wan a Republican. Almost identically the
same charges now mado against Roberts
were made against Cannon. He read
from the speeches of S. S. Cox of New
York and other prominent Democrats who
opiÂ»->tÂ«ed tho heating of Cannon on the
ground that it would establish a danger
ous precedent and produce chaos In the
future.
â¢'Those Democrats." paid he. "roue
abovo party prejudice and stood by the
constitution and the right. . oratic
applause.)
Ho cited the case of Ramy. colored Re
publican from South Carolina. In the
forty-fifth Congress, where the Demo
crats had insisted that he should have
the oath administered to him. He also
quoted from the late President James A.
Giirfield in support of his contention that
where the credentials presented were in
regular form there was no power In the
HouÂ«e to exclude him. Richardson read
the words of Garfield, which concluded:
"There are no personal objections."
"But there are personal objections in
tho case before the House." Interposed
Taylor amid !auÃhtÂ»r and applause.
"Not personal objections to the mem
er elect, ' said Richardson: "personal
disqualifications only are alleged.
"Yes. personal objections." shouted a
member on the Republican side, amid an
other outburst.

and !n the stillness could be heard to the
farthest corner of the hall. As he got into
rgument his voice grew louder, until
i.n Mvarmi occasions it rang out until the
; fretted ceiling overhead gave back the
echo.
Roberts began by sending to the clerk's
desk an.l having read a copy of his nat
uralization paptTs, as he said that all the
documents In this extraordinary case
should be before the House. He then read
a paragraph from "McCreary on Elec
tions." containing a general caution
against hasty procedure in election con-
He continued:
HOW, gentlemen, that It the statement of one
whose book has authority In this country. And
If it Is the rule of the House of Representatives
In canes that arise to the dignity of a contest,
how Infinitely more should that rule be ob
served when a mere protest Is made against a
member who presents himself to take the oath
of office.
I next proceed to the consideration of the
charges that are nuppot<ed to justify what the
gentleman from Ohio (Taylor) himself concedes
to be an unusual proceeding, and which my
friends on this side (Richardson of Tennessee)
has demonstrated to be an unprecedented pro
ceeding. The gentleman from Ohio bases his
charge upon a court record: that some twelve
years ago. in the mMst of our conflict In the
then Territory of Utah over the subject of
polygamy, I pleaded guilty to a charge of mis
demeanor. The gentleman seems to be oblivious
to the fact that since the date of his court rec
ord on this subject we have had two Presiden
tial amnesties proclaimed that have been ap
plied to men disqualified by the Edmunds- ,
Tucker act. I understand gentlemen who were |
lawyers to admit this fact, and they will cer
tainly appreciate the cost of it.
The gentleman from Ohio has no court rec
ord to show that I was ever arraigned or con
drmned of crime whatsoever Flnce the promul- I
ration of the amnesty proclamation of the
I'resident of the United States. The gentle
man â¢ ms also to forget the fact that since
the Confession of that misdemeanor to which !
he referred there was passed by Congress an
enabling act authorized by the. State of Utah
to form a State government. That enabling
act also had a provision embodied In It that I
qualified all citizens withlh the limits of the j
Territory to become citizens of the United
StntPS and was particularly framed to remove
the disqualifications and (Usabilities which had j
bet-n created by the Edmunds-Tucker law. i
The gentleman seems to forget also that the
State constitution of Utah was satisfactory to
the President and his advisors, and Utah has ;
>een admitted as a State Into the Union and |
has taken upon itself the responsibilities of a
sovereign State, declaring under Its constitu
tion who of the people residing In Its borders
â hall exercise the elective franchise and be
qualified for office as citizens of that great
commonwealth.
The gentleman from Ohio says that ever
â lace Ittl I have been a persistent lawbreaker
In the State of Utah. If that be true, let me
ask why It Is I was not punished for law
breaking. Certainly there was no disposition
not to execute the law on the part of the peo
ple of Utah. Its administration was In the
hands of non-Mormons, of those who had no
sympathy with men of my religious faith. All
the machinery of the law was in the hands of
Federal appointees. How Is It that I could
be an open and defiant lawbreaker and yet
escape thÂ» penalty of law?
The gentleman's objection then Is based not
upon court record, but upon affidavits and
papers that have been supplied him by the
people.
And now as to the manner In which these
charges are nude It has been about fifteen
months Â»â !:-..â <â  they began, since the Representa
tive from Utah was heralded throughout this
land as a defiant lawbreaker. And yet I walked
the streets of Salt I*ake In open day. within
easy reach of the law. an.l my faults lay open
to the law If I were guilty Of transgressing.
Other men were arrested before the courts of
Dtah and were fined tor the very offense al
leged against me. and yet DO complaint was
made against me. No; It did not suit the pur
pose of those who had this present agitation In
hand to vindicate the law quietly and by the
usual method*. They desired particularly to
have this case, upon which, apparently, to
arouse the sentiment of the country. Not until
my business called me â¢â¢:â¢...
to make any charges against me. Hut the mo
ment of. or shortly after, my departure they
began this agitation, resulting In the present
sentiment of the country now aroused against
me. I cull roar attention next to the fact that
the only charge against me. even by the pres
ent opponents of the resolution, la that of a
misdemeanor. They do not charge a felony.
I understand that the members of Congress
are granted certain privileges while In attend
ance up<-n this House. It would be Impossible
to arrest any one of. the members on the charge
of misdemeanor. And yet you would deny me
the privilege of being sworn as a member of
this House, upon the allegation of the existence
of some charge or other that I was guilty of
a misdemeanor. For the thing for which thÂ«
law Itself could not lay a hand on me while In
attendance upon this House, you propose â I
sp*ak of the little cotf-rle of men who have en
tered Into this conspiracy to crowd this ques
tion to the front at this particular time, and for
the reason that they are fearful that If the
matter should go to a consideration under a
resolution to expel the member from Utah they
could net marshal the necessary two-thirds
vote to accomplish their purpose to pass the
present resolution.
I understand, sir, 'hat these Immunities are
not given for the benefit of Individual mem
bers. They axe given rather as a protection
for his constituency, who are entitled to hi*
services ar their representative. And. there
fore. I Invoke the protection that la given to the
constituency nf a sovereign State against the
proceedings they are Instituting here to deprive
me of th.- privilege of twiner nwi>ni In as a
member of this House. Privilege, did I say.
sir? 1 am not asking any privileges in this
House. I am not asking any favors of the
members of this House, L'mier the shadow of
the constitution of the United States. I merely
demand, both for myself an.l for thÂ« people
of my State, the protection that Is due usâ
and :t Is a demandâ lt Is asking no favors.
(Great applause on the Democratic side, and
In the galleries.)
Roberts next called attention to thÂ«
precedent In the Forty-third Congress In
the case of Cannon, adding:
I can add nothing to the force of that gen
tleman's remarks, except this: that In the case
Of Mr. Cannon the House was dealing with a
Delegate from a Territory, not the Representa
tive of the people of a sovereign State. They
were dealing with a delegate who was created
by a statute passed by the Congress of the
United States. And throughout the discussion
It was alleged as a reason for taking exceptions
to him that they could do so because he was
unprotected by the provisions of the constitu
tion. And yet. Fir. knowing he was but a crea
tion of law, still they admitted htm as a mem
ber upon the floor of this House It Is to be
remarked In this oonnectlon that, strange to
say. the course of nature was not disturbed.
Notwithstanding an alleged p<ly(fimlst was
permitted by the vote of a Republican Con
rress to remain upon the floor of this House. It
did not transpire, as It is said It did transpire
In ancient Rome a little ere the mighty Julius
fell: the. grave stood not tenantless; the
sheeted dead did not stand and gibber In the.
etreets of Rome. Why. sir, the sun was not
darkened MC ti as the moon turned to blood.
Actually, sir, the rain continued to fall upon
the Just and the unjust alike. (Laughter and
applause.)
Gentlemen of the Democratic party, some few
of whom may perhaps tremble a little at the
thunderous objection that has been presented
as pretending to voice the sentiment of the
country upon this subject. I want to call your
attention to another thing, and that la that
notwithstanding a Republican Congress seated
this roan, yet the Republican party really sur
vived Its action. (Laughter.) Why. It Is here
to-day and I believe, gentlemen of the major
ity, that It could survive even If It should seal
the present Representative from the State of
Utah.
.Proceeding, he took up the charge that
Utah had broken her compact with the
United States by the Â©lection of an alleged
polygamous Representative, if that were
true, then Utah had simply followed the
Illustrious example, of the present nation
al administration.
"I affirm." said he. "that there Is abun
dant evidence that objections similar to
those In the present case were made to
the President and the Senate against the
appointment of certain Federal officials
in Utah, but the objections were waived
aside."
"Do you mean to say that polygamies
were appointed to, Federal offices In Utah
by the present executive?" queried Hop
kins (R.) of Illinois.
"With the knowledge of the President?*
added Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio quickly
amid some laughter on the Uemocrutlc
side.
"When men were applicants for Federal
office* In Utah," reiterated Roberts, â¢*..Â».
jections were made and affidavits were
filed both with the President and the Sen
ate, but nevertheless the appointments
were made."
"That Joes not answer my question "
observed Hopkins.
Roberts urged that the case ought to go
to the Judiciary Committee, where it
could be Investigated. He warned the Re
publican aide that this was a serious
question. If the people of Utah were
pullty of violating the compact with the
Union, what of the President, who hud
appointed to life positions In Utah men
chargeable with the same offense?
Roberts ridiculed the manner In wh'ch
the petition favoring his expulsion hna
been procured. In concluding he denied
that the members who voted to seat him
would bo voting for polygamy. The ques
tion of polygamy was settled.
"I hold It as an honor," said ho, "that'
I will bo quoted long in Utah as one who
helped to tittle that question on the floor
of the constitutional convention. 1 am not
defending polygamy. It is dead."
Roberts concluded by thanking Taylor
and the House for their Indulgence. He
was given a round of applause as he took
his seat.
Dlnsmoro (D.) of Arkansas brieflly op
posed the Taylor resolution.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio denounced Rob
erts' statement concerning the appoint
ment by the President of polygamlsts In
Utah as a miserable subterfuge.
"I make the statement," said he, "and
I defy contradiction, that the President
of the United States never knowingly ap
pointed a polygamist to office. As well
might one charge that the President had
plunged his stainless hands in human
blood as to charge that he appointed to
public office men guilty of the crime al
leged against the gentleman from Utah."
(Great applause on the Republican side.)
"1 charged and I reiterate It." said
Roberts, "that men appointed to office In
Utah were charged before the President
and the Senate with the same misde
meanor of which it Is charged I am
guilty."
"Were they guilty?" inquired Dalzell.
"It does not apoear whether they were
guilty." answered Roberts, raising his
voice and looking around the hall. "They
were only charged, as I am charged."
(Applause on the Democratic side, in
which many people in the galleries Join
ed.)
Taylor concluded the debate. Roberts,
he said, had exhibited a large incapacity
to understand his (Taylor's) position, his
(Roberts') position or the spirit of the
American peopleâ a righteous expression
of their sentiment Justly founded, how
ever much misdirected. He did not say
Mr. Roberts was guilty. But he indicted
him upon his own responsibility. Said
he:
"I am not unmindful of the Importance
of the question the Home Is about to de
cide. It is unusual, but not unprecedented.
We do not undertake to determine the
right of the claimant to that seat, but
only whether he shall bo halted at the
bar of the House and await the adminis
tration of the oath until the House shall
determine that right.
"Mr. Speaker. Utah was admitted as a
State Into the Union on the 4th day of
January. I*!*}. These are the alleged facts
against the claimant: First, that he was
indicted In February, IRS7. for unlawful
cohabitation under the Edmunds act and
pleaded guilty on April 29, ISB9. and was
incarcerated on that account In the pen
itentiary for four months: second^ that he
has persistently from that time forward
down to a recent date been guilty of the
offense of unlawful cohabitation; also 1
that he has continued from the date of
his conviction nnd is now a polygamlst.
"By the alleged facts these questions
are raised:
"Firstâ Aft he was convicted in IRS9
did he not then become and ever after
ward remain by reason of section 8 Ineli- :
gible to be a member of Congress unless 1
he were pardoned? If ho were guilty of
polygamous cohabitation between No
vember 1. IS9O, and the date of the Harri
son proclamation he was not pardoned by
that proclamation.
"This situation, assuming the facts to he
as alleged, raises several questions:
"Firstâ Roberts was convicted as stat- j
ed, is the burden on him to affirmatively
bring himself within the embrace of the
amnesty proclamation?
"Secondâ lf he was guilty of polygamous
cohabitation after November 1. 1590. Is he
not without the benefit of the proclama
tion?
"Thirdâ lf he continued to be the head of
more than one family under his original
polygamous marriage contract after the.
Ist of November. ISJO, and without polyga
mous cohabitation, then Is he not a
polygamist under the definition of the
Supreme Court in the case of Murphy vs.
Ramsey?
"Fourthâ May not the facts. If estab
lished, and Independent of any law creat-
Ing Inedibility. Justify the House In re
fuslne admission to Roberts?
"Fifthâ Does not the compact created
between th<- V: â  . ami the
of I'tnli by th.' proclamation, enabl::
institution justify the House In re
fusing to admit a representative from
that State who is to-day, under the defi
nition of the Supremo Court, a Dohrca
mlst?
"Sixthâ May It not be that upon a care
ful examination of the law it would be
found that the claimant Is not a citizen
of the United States, and If not, of course
Is Ineligible?
"Seventhâ ls it wise If the acts be as
alleged, unless we are absolutely without
power to keep Roberts out. to subject his
case to the doubtful process of expulsion?
âdoubtful for two reasons: First, because
It requires the concurrence of two-thirds
to expel him; second, because very emi
nent lawyers from the beginning of the
Government down to the present time
have taken the position that the Houso
has not right to expel except for some
misconduct while a member, and relating
to his offense as a member. In the Forty
fifth Congress, in the Mattison caso. a
committee by an all but unanimous voice
reported that the House had no power,
mean arid low and vile as the character of
that man was, exhibited by his conduct
before that time, to expel him, because
it had not the right to expel a man for
that which had occurred prior to his flec
tion to Congress."
Taylor went Into a legal argument In
support of the proposition that Congress
had the right to bold Roberts Ineligible
to sit as a member of Congress. He con
tended that the language of the constitu
tion with respect to the Qualifications of
members of the House was negative In Its
character and that with Congress was left
the right to add to these qualifications.
He then cited as precedents for the pres
ent course the cases of Proctor Knott
Boyd Winchester and John m. Rice of
Kentucky, who were charged with dis
loyalty after the war, and concluded as
follows:
Mr. Speaker, we are told That this will make
nn unhappy precedent. Precedent? Why. what
v.f do hÂ»re are do before the open and gazlnK
eyes of the world, and we are at once draxK**<i
to the bar of history to answer for our deeds.
We are In no cloister court. We are no Â»tat
ute-bound tribunal. We anÂ» the servants of
the people, empowered, thank God, under the.
constitution to do the right as we see the
right. That Is the law to us. The public
eye Is on us. the public conscience quickens vÂ«.
In that presence and before such a Judge we
can do no wrong If we but obey It. (Applauds
on the Republican side.)
The vote was then taken, first on thÂ«
substitute, which was defeated. 6^â247
The vote then recurred upon the adop
tion of Taylor's resolution, the roll being
called upon the demand of the Republi
cans. The resolution was adopted 302 -
30. Those who voted In the negative were*
Adnmson. Allen (Mississippi), Bailey, Ball
Brewer. Burllson, '^arma.-k. Cooper, Dnvey"

sion of the Senate lasted two hours and

President's message. The reading was
largely perfunctory, few Senators accord
ing it any attention.
The announcement of the death of Sen

sincere regret. Although he was not of
tlclally a member of the body he was well
known to many of the Senators and by
them was held in high regard At the

SENATE MEMBERS
IN PARTY CAUCUSES
Reorganization of Committees Dis
cussed by Republicans and
the Opposition.
WASHINGTON. Dec. s.â Three cau
cuses were held In the Senate end of the
<"ap:t"! to-day. They were under the
auspices, respectively, of the Republican,
tIM Ixmocratlc and the Independent Sen
ators, the last named Including the Silver
Republicans and the Populists, and each
considered the reorganization of the Pen
ate committees. In each case the detail
work was referred to special committees.
Senator Allison was empowered by thÂ«
Republican caucus to select a commit
tee '>f nine to confer with the opposition
and make the r.pportlonment of members.
There was a su^g.stion that the Repub
lican representation on committees
should be In proportion to the Republican
membership of the Senate, and In reply
to a question Senator Allison said thit
the Republican* numbered about flve
eighths .>f the Â«-nrlÂ»-,Â» Senate. After some
discussion the suggestion was abandoned
because of the effect that such a demand
In t! â¢ would have upon the
House, when the Republicans have pro
portionately a much smaller majority.
Tti'Ti' was, however, a general under
standing that the Republicans should
have clear majorities on all committees.
Senator Hale moved a committee on the
Insular possessions of the United States,
and upon the suggestion of Senator
LoJge agreed to amen>l his motion so as
to provide for two new committees, one
to cover Cuba, and the other to include
the affairs of Porto Rico anil the Philip
pines. The motion was referred to the
proposed committee on committees, hut
no disposition was mailo on a suggestion
made sotto voce by Senator Mason that
be, S. i;ati>r Hoar and Senator Hale
should be given places on the proposed
Philippine commission. Tho conference
really delegated the whole subject to the
committee on committees, which Senator
Allison promiPf-'l to appoint promptly.
The Democrats transacted no busings
beyon the unanimous selection of Sen
ator Jones of Arkansas as chairman of
tin- caucus to succeed Senator Turpie.
and the authorization of the chairman to
appoint a eommltt'-e to confer with the
Republican committee on the reorganiza
tion of the standing committees.
The Independents agreed to act with the
Democrats In the organization of the
Senate, and Senator i'ettignw was ap
pointed to act as a member on the
minority committee on committees. This
conference was attended by all the Silver
Republicans and Populist Senators, of
whom there are eight.

TWO FINE SPECIMENS
Of Physical Manhood.
No form of athletic exercise demands
â¢such perfect physical condition as prise
fighting. Every muscle In the body must
be fully developed and supple, and the
heart, lungs and stomach must act to per-
fection.
Whether we Indorse priie fighting or not
It Is. nevertheless, interesting to know
the manner by which men arrive at such
physical perfection.
James Jeffries, the present champion
heavy-weight of the world, and his gal-
lant opponent, Tom Bharkey, Id the great-
est pugilistic encounter that haa -*ver
taken place, both pursued much the â  rn^
course of training and the first and most
Important part of this training was to got
the stomach in condition and to keep the
digestion absolutely perfect, so that every
muscle ani nerve would be at Its hi,Â£n..st
capabilities.
This was not done by a secret patent
medicine, but both of these great pu^ll-
iFts used a well known natural digestive
tablet sold by druggists under name of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and composed
of the digestive ferments* which every
stomach requires for healthy digestion.
Champion Jeffries pays: "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets prevent acidity, strength-
en the stomach and Insure perfect diges-
tion. They keep a man In fine physical
condition." Signed, James J. Jeffries,
champion of the world.
The gallant fighter. Sharkey. aays: "Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets remove all dis-
comfort after eating. They rest the BUm-
ach and restore It to a healthful condi-
toin. I heartily recommend them."
Signed. Thos. J. Sharkey.
The advantage of the daily use of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets Is that they keep
people well and ward off sickness and are
equally valuable to well persons as to the
dyspeptics. Another advantage is that
these tabl3ts contain no cathartics, or poi-
sons of any character, but limply diges-
tive ferments which are found In every
healthy stomach, and when digestion Is
Imperfect It Is because the stomach lacKS
some of these elements, and Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets supply it.
They are no cheap cathartic, but a per-
fectly safe and efficient digestive and the
demand for them Is greater than the Hale
of all other so-called dyspepsia cures com-
bined. No remedy could possibly reach
such a place In public esteem except as
the result of positive merit.
Full sized packages are sold by all
druggists at 50 cents and the best habit
you can possibly form Is to take a 6 r u-
art Tablet after each meal. They matte
weak stomachs strong and keep strong
stomachs vigorous.

FARMERS WOULD
CUT SALARIES
Action Taken by Po
mona Grange.
Special Dispatea to The Call.
STOCKTON. Dec. 5.-At the last meet
ing of Pomona Grange, held at mil,
some very strong resolutions were passed.
Members of the Grange called attention
to the salaries paid county officials and
announced that they â will not support any
candidate for the Legislature who will not
work for a reduction of salaries to con
form to the Income of a farmer. The fol
lowing are the resolutions In full:
Whereas. RÂ«cosnizlng the fact that the til
ler of the noil Is constantly descending In thÂ«
social Bcaif. and the occupation of the farmer
Is being brought into disrepute, and believing
that we are fact drifting to a peasantry, and
whereas, we view with alarm the fact that
nearly all of the moneyed Institutions of the
State are loadlnK up with land taken .in mort
gage*, and believing that thin lamentable state
of affairs l!< due to unjust taxation and hitch
salaries raid State and county officials and
*a.lariÂ»vi people in general, and believing that
said salaries are out of all proportion to the
Income of farmer* and business men, therefor*
be It
Resolved. By Pomona Grange of San Joaquln
County that we pledge iurÂ»rlveÂ« individually
and collectively not to support any candidate
for the Legislature, no matter by what party
nominated, unless ho will pledce himself un
reservedly. If elected, to labor the whole ses
â lon. If need be, to reduce the salaries of our
county officials to conform to the Income of
the farmers and business men.

HAVR DONE MURDER
Startling Admission Made by a Wit
ness Charged With Assault
With a Deadly Weapon.
NAPA. Dec. 6.â C. Rlckerr of Snell Val
ley, during his trial in the Superior Court
here to-day on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon, preferred by L. B. Pax
son of the same valley, created a sensa
tion by admitting on the witness-stand
that he would have killed Paxson if ho
could on the day of the alleged assault.
To-day's proceedings are the outgrowth
of a quarrel between the two men on Oc
tober 28 last at Klckert's ranch In this
County. The exact facts of the quarrel
did not get before the public until the toj
tlmony of Rlcken and Paxuon was heard
Hlckert claims that the defendant came
to his ranch and assaulted him with a
whip, stones and a plow share. Paxson
on the other hand states that on the day
of the alleged assault Rickert attacked
him with a knife and cut him over the
eye. The wound Is visible. The two men
are residents of Napa Valley and the ver
dict of the jury Is awaited with Interest

HlÂ» Kxcelleney, Governor BrndU-y. OovÂ»rnor
Of Kentuckyâ Sir: Since the Uc.ird or E'.ec

of truth In the reports to which we herein call
your attention.
WILL P. IKY
T. W. ELLIS,
CHARLES B. POYNT2,
State Board of Election Commlssloners.
Governor Bradley wrote the following
reply, which he carried personally Into
the boardroom and handed to Judge
Pryor, chairman of the board:
Gentlemen: I regret very much that you
rhould have for onÂ» moment believe. l the mali
cious He that has been circulated and of which
you â¢ak. 1 have absolutely become wearied
by contra^llctlnÃ the lies o{ a partisan prea*.
You Â«huuld kn>>w me well enough to know that
1 don't resort to any such clandestine method*,
and especially you should know that the report
Is false. In view of the fact that I waited upon
the chairman of our board yesterday tnnrn
inK and offered. If he desired, to exclude all
perron*, except thr*e who had businefs In the
department, from the building*. Any Materm-nt
that any men or sÂ«-t of men ti<tve been brought
here with my knowledge, consent or approval to
piand ; â >â¢ with a view of cverawlnK the board.
Is a malicious He. I have brought no man here
for any purpose, and no man It her* by my or
der. I see It stated In the papers that certain
members of the State Guard are here In cltl
zenÂ«" clothes. I have seen several officers here,
but they are here Individually and not aa mem
bers 01 that orKanlzatlon. and not by any con
nivance on my part. Instead of Intimidating I
nm ready at all times to protect any officer of
the law In the discharge of his sworn duty.
W. O. BRADLEY.
As he entered Governor Bradley In
quired:
"May I interrupt the board a mo
ment? I want to make a public state
ment. I received your communication a
few moments ago. I was â  little busy at
the time and my attention waa not called
to it until a moment ago. 1 answered it
at once. I not only want to answer It in
writing, but I want to make a statement
for the benefit of lying 1 correspondents
that are purposely miHrepresentinEr me."
Here the Governor was interrupted by
Judge Harris, the senior Democratic
counsel, who for some time had been try
inc to break in. but could not until Gov
ernor Bradley paused to breathe.
"T object to this statement." said
Judge Argis. "I don't know what it is
about."
"It is about the presence of the sol
diers." said Judge Pryor.
"Then I have no objection." replied
Judge Hargls.
"I don't care if you do object." replied
the Governor, with a strong emphasis on
the "I." "I want to say there are no
FOldlers here. There are some officers
here who have come here on Individual
business. No soldier is here, no citizen li
here, by my order. I do not do things!
that way. I want to say. Mr. Chairman,
that I came to you yesterday morning,
seeing this crowd here, and I .-.lid to you.
'If you want the crowd excluded from
this building I will do it.' "
"That Is right." retorted Judge Pryor,
"and I bo notified the board."
â¢ "I say to you." went on the Governor,
speaking in quick, emphatic tones, "that
no officer shall be intimidated in the dis
charge of his sworn duty so long as I am
Governor of this State, ui.<i any man who
Intimates that 1 have called soldiers hero
or anybody here Is a malicioud liar. That
Is all I have to say to the board."
"\\'e thought," replied Judge Pryor.
"that it was due to us and just to you
that you should be notitled of the fact
that was suggested."
"That is right." said Governor Bradley
as he walked toward the door. Turning
with his hand on the doorknob, he sola
emphatically:
"And 1 am responsible for it In here or
out of here."
After leaving the Commissioners' room
Governor Bradley stopped In front of a
larce crowd of spectators who tilled the
outer ofllce of the Secretary of State.
"Now. boys," he said, "you knuw you
are talking about Intimidation and 1
don't really think It Is wise for you to
remain here. Of course we all know you
would not intimidate anybody, but it Is
Just as well that there should not be an
arrest."
In obedience to the suggestion the
crowd, which comprised as many Demo
crats as Republicans, quietly left the of
fice.
In addition to the counties passed yes
! terday for argument before the contesting
board the counties of Hopkins. Jeftcrson
I Johnson. Knr.x. Lewis. Magoffln and Mar
| tin were passed to-dny. Jefferson County,
; In which Louisville is situated, was passed
; without much argument. Immediately on
the conclusion of the canvass Judge
I'ryor remarked to th- Democratic at
torneys:
"Gentlemen, you will please submit in
, writing when the board convenes to-mor
row written copies of the charge* you
I bring In each county and will of courso
serve copies upon th- attorneys on the
] other side "
Mr. Wilson of the Republicans then sug-
I gested that as the. great question to be
settled by the board to-morrow was
whether or not it had the right to go be
hind the certified returns it might be well
to argue that question first, as all the
others depended upon It. The matter was
i not decided, but It probably will be
! brought up a* the opening of the first con
: test in the morning. So Tar there has not
bees, the lightest indication of trouble in
Frankfort.

ATTEMPTED TO HANG
HERSELF IN A CELL
THE ACT OF ALMA HOWARD, A
MORPHINE "FIEND."
She Was Sentenced to Five Months
for Petty Larceny, but Said She
Would Rather Die.
Alma Howard, a morphine "fiend." at
tempted to hang herself In a cell in the
City Prison yesterday morning, and if a
"trusty" who had occasion to pass the
cell had not discovered her she would
have accomplished her purpose. She was
in one of the women's cells, which are
entirely excluded from observation of any
of the prison officials.
She had been talking with her attorney
a few minutes before, and when ii
"trusty" took her back to her cell, of
which she was the solo occupant, he no
ticed that she was very much excited. It
struck him a few minutes later that he
would pass the cell and see how she was
petting along, and he noticed her hanging
by the neck. She had made a rope out of
her petticoat, and. climbing on top Of a
bench, had tied the ends to a cross bar
to the entrance to the toilet. The other
ends she tied around her neck and Jumped
off the bench. The "trusty" promptly
opened the cell door and. taking hold of
her body, gave it a Jerk and Broke the
rope. He then notified the prison official*
and she was sent to the Receiving Hos
pital, where she soon recovered. She was
later sent to the Branch County Jail.
She came Into notice in August last,
when she was sentenced to thirty days
for stealing a silk waist from a dry goods
store on Market street. On Wednesday
last Judge Graham sentenced her to five
months for stealing a gold pin belonging
to her landlady, but she declared that
she would rather kill herself than Â«.-rv..
the sentence. She was foolish enough to
concoct a story that she belonged to the
aristocratic Fairfax family ..r Virginia
but later admitted that .^he was a urid

TRIED A SECOND TIME
TO END HIS LIFE
Lannis McClaren Attempts to Jump
Out of a Window, but Is
Frustrated.
I.nnnis McClaren, the merchant of Cres

tempted to end his life Monday morning
by stabbing himself twenty times In the
region of the heart, tried to complete his
efforts by attempting to jump out of a
window at MS Hayes street. Again he
was unsuccessful, though hut for the vigi
lance of two ladles he would now be past
all earthly suffering.
When McClaren's wounds were dressed
on Monday he was taken to the residence
of Mrs. McCarthy at 648 Hayes street and
a careful watch was placed over th.- de
mented man. Taking advantage yester
day afternoon of the absence of his
nurse McÂ«'laren proceeded to crawl
through the window of his bedroom,
which Is on th* second Hoor. His evident
Intention was to throw himself to the
street below, and he might have succceed
ed but for the return of his nurse, who,
seeing her patient's perilous position,
grabbed him by the arms and attempted
to pull him Into the room. Her screams
for help attracted Mrs. McCarthy and a
painter who was working on the outside
of the house, and with their combined ef
forts they managed to drag him Into the
room. His condition became worse and
he was i moved to the Receiving Hospi
tal and was later taken to St. Mary's
Hospital, where he Is carefully watched.

GIRLS LIBRARY.
BY JOHN MILLAR. M.A.
Reading Circles.
The years of school life are short for
most persons. Fifty per cent of all chil
dren who enter school leave before the
age of 12. Too often the love of read:
is not created before the duties of life
are to be assumed. The girl who has no
taste for literature should seek, so far
as she can. the environment which will
give her a love for good books. Parents
and friends may not be the best Judges of
proper reading matter. Not Infrequently
teachers suggest reading courses for ex
pupils of their schools. It Is a great ad
vantage to young people when bob ptr
son in the community Interests himself In
the formation of reading circles. The
young woman who Joins a good liter;' ry
society or reading club has a chance of
getting above many of the petty cares
and the gossip of this life Into a higher
realmâ the realm of ideals.
Organizations of this kind sometimes
anbtmoe itiidCÃti attending â¢ â¢
Institutions, but more frequently th>-
membership is made up of persons who
huvo finished school life. When the laat
lesson Is Riven children by the teacher
there should be some mean* of hav<ng
the process of education continued. It Is
becoming more fully recognized that the
boys and girls who are "out of school"
deserve consideration. Public libraries
are not enough. Hence the many move
ments such as "university extension" of
the present day. The need of "school ex
tension" Is more pressing. Perhaps no
development in this direction has had
such marvelous success as the Chautau
qua literary and scientific circle. The
plan has paved the way for a system of
home reading and study which has In
come widespread. It Is often maintained
that methods of this kind cannot furnish
opportunities for getting the best train
ing, and that the knowledge gained hi
superficial. There Is some force In these
objections. Attendance at college Is to
be preferred. Only a few have, however,
the privilege of going to the higher -rats
of learning. It Is for the great body of
young people that movements of the kind
mentioned are Intended. A demand for
the education of the masses Is a sign of
the Christian conscience. Hence the or
ganization of literary associations in con
nection with many congregations. In
obedience to the same demand. Christian
Endeavor and Epworth League move
ments have not overlooked the benefits
of good literature. Unfortunately, efforts
of the kind have not reached many
young persons. What is needed very
much Is public school extension, Bnme
plan Is urgent for extending the useful
ness of the school to the students who
have at an early age been obliged to
work In the home, the office, the store or
the factory. Reading clubs may be
formed wherever there Is available some
person able and willing to give advice re
garding the books to oe taken up. It is
not necessary that the club should be
large, provided the few who constitute Its
membership are filled with the desire for
self-Improvement. The organization of a
reading circle Is a simple process. A
dozen or a less number meet once a week
to discuss matters pertaining to the book
read by each of the members. Another
book is read, and at the next meeting
notes are again compared. Opinions are
freely expressed, and mutual hen*-: re
suits from the Interchange of opinion.
No attempt at critical examination

LIâ ARITHMETIC OF THE OFFICE
Lesson No. 3 â Discount.
A discount it) a reduction trom the facÂ»Â»
value. When we Hay that a discount Of 5
per cent is allowed on a bin or an account
we mean that $5 has been "thrown off"
â¢ry $11*1. when we >.iy ih.it a bank
discounts our not. at
that they charge Â»Â« Interest at the rate
of 6 per cent for cashing the note. Note
the following illustrations:
A dealer *ells â  lull ol i^n.i.is th<Â» gross
amount of which Is $543 Â»>'; h^ allows a dis
count of 20 per cent; find the net amount
of the bill.
We find 20 per cent of $543 <V) by multl
plylnÃ by 20 and dividing by MO. Twenty
per cent of a number i.* 20 hundredth* of
the number. To divide by 100 we cut off
th<> two additional decimal places. It
iMi't necessary, however, t" write down
the 20 an a multiplier. We simply multi
ply by 2 and carry une place
to the rigrht. The discount in $16S 72. and
the not amount of the bill in $674 88. To
find 30 per cent multiply by :i and carry
one place to the right. To rind 40 per cent
multiply by 4 ami carry one place to the
right. To find 60 per cent take one-half:
to find 25 per cent take one-fourth- to
find 12W per rent take one-eighth. To
flrul 1') per cent of a number we simply
takÂ»- one-tenth of Itâ that Is, remove the
decimal point one place to the left- 10
per cent r.f $4Â»> 50 la $49 65. In the same
way we <;.n dsdud two or three discounts
as in the following example:
A dealer allows 20. io and 2 oft a bill of
1720; find the net amount.
The net amount of the bill Is $508 03. To
deduct 2 per cent multiply by 2 and carry
two places to the right: 3 per cent, 4 per
cent. 6 per cent. 7 per cent. etc.. are de
ducted In the same way; 6 per cent la one
half of 10 per cent; I per cent la the same
number with the decimal point removed
two places to the left; Vi per cent Is one
half of 1 per cent. It Is not necessary to
carry the figures more than three places
to the right of the decimal point. Solve
the following exercises:
. 1- A merchant sells goods catalogued at
$67fi 40 at a discount of 20 per cent find
the net amount of the bill.
2 ;. i Th catalogue price of a particular
article Is $27 50. If a discount of 40 per
cent Is allowed, what Is the selling prloe?
should be attempted. Too much time my
bo wasted if the "niceties" of diction,
figures of rhetoric, etc.. receive attention.
An Intelligent understanding: of what 1*
read should be the main object. If a
play of Shakespeare Is read let the an
notated editions receive but little favor.
Discussions foreign to the purpose* of
the club should be discouraged. The
books read should be the works that have
had their value tested. It Is not neces
sary to have uniform copies of the text*
taken up. One good effect of these circles
should be to weaken the everlasting habit
of some young persons for reading trashy
books. The leader In an organization of
this kind may have discouragements.
The successful teacher or th* successful
preacher must have a stout heart. Much
of the success of the circle will depend on
enthusiasm, personal magnetism, tact
and good comxnon-sense.
Reading Courses.
To make a list of books for which pref
erence should be given is not an easy
task. Much depends upon the tastts. at
tainments and purposes, of the reader.
Guidance Is very - rabta, and teacher*
who have a Rood knowledge of literature
will generally prove the best advtaer*.
It Is a common practice for schools to
prescribe courses for supplementary read-
Ing. When convenient, a young woman
will not make a mistake by taking up the
books read by the students of the gram
mar or high school. In this way she may
keep herself In touch with the work of
those who are more fortunate in not be
ing obliged to leave school so soon. If a
girl has access to a public library a sys
tematic course of reading ...
sued. To help girls who may not have
some one to guide them a fortes of read
ing courses Is ht-re recommended. It la
not assumed that a better choice cannot
be made. It Is hoped, however, the selec
tions will prove serviceable:

TYSON INQUEST.
The Girl's Dying Statement Wai In*
formal and Not Admissible
in Court.
Coroner-elect Dr. R Beverley Cole at
tended the Inquest held yesterday morning
by Coroner Hill upon the body of Su-EIU
Tyson, who died of septic peritonitis at
014 A Powell street on December I. ThÂ«
Coroner-elect appeared to bo much edified
at the judicial manner in which Coroner
Hill conducted the, examination.
Dr. 8. Newman, who li accused of hav
ing caused the death of Miss Tyson, and
John Vaccarl. her lover, were present,
but did not take the stand. It developed
from the testimony that the girl dying
statement would not be admissible In a
court of law. because On. Mather and
McNutt. who took her statement, ilid not
advise her that she was In a dying con
dition. Her statement was that Dr. New
man had been guilty of gross malpractice
and that Vaccari was the author of her
trouble.
SurÃical Instruments found on Dr. New
man's operating table at the time of his
arrest were produced at the Inquest, and
Dr. Leland testified that If they had beÂ«n
used In the dirty condition In which they
were found there would be almost â¢ cer
tainty of blood poisoning from them.
A drug clerk named Eshmann testified
that he filled a prescription written by
Dr. Newman ana presented by Vaccarl.
Dr. Newman ha. l stated to Detective*
Dillon and Kuan that he had never seen
the dead jrtrl and did not know her.
The inquest will be resumed this mora

TRIED TO CAPTURE A CANNON.
One Deputy Street Superintendent
Fired With Military Passion.
All the mm with the nerve requisite to
capture a cannon are not in the Philip
pines, nor yet are they in South Africa.
Â«Â»ne lit least is a deputy in the Street De
jwirtmcnt of Sun Francisco. ll' mar.l
fested his bravery yesterday, and while
he tonic no xii'TÂ© of ordnance it wan not
li!f fault.
The cannon upon which the Street De
partment deputy charged was located on
th*Â» Powell-stre.t pavement In front of
the Colombia Theat.-r. It is a large threo-
Inch brass affair, paid to have seen ser
vice in the Civil War. Ai present it is
one of the advertising proj>erUes of
"Shenandoah" and was placed in position
In front of the playhouse to advertise tho
current attraction. A supe uniformed .1
a Yankee soldier paraded up and down as
If on guard of thÂ»* piece. For days and
day*. since the beginning of the
â¢"Shenandoah" engagement the cannon
has been unmolested, the fierce-looking,
phony Kolfller probably deterring interfer
ence. ]t heid It* position In brassy si
lence until yesterday, when a deputy of
the Street Suj*rintend*nt hove in view.
He paw the big gun and the fake soldiÂ«Â»r
and Immediately sounded (he charge. The
Foldler never llinrhoj when the deputy
ordered him to drat; thÂ«s cannon away.
"I'm paid to act." said the uniformed
ran "not to labor. I>o it yourself."
The deputy, apparently, wasn't looking
for work, but he was up to 1 trick worth
two of it. Out of one pocket he whipped
& hammer, out of another a couple of
tack*, and out of still another a placard,
which he proo^ded to tack to the car
riage of the pun. Th* printed notice was
to inform the proprietor of the cannon
that if he didn't remove It within an hour
it would be hauled to the corporation
yard.
The deputy, having finished, surveyed
his work, turm-d on his heH and disap
peared, looking for another cannon n
capture. He returned in an hour prepared
to cart the gun iÂ«v .<>-. according to the
printed threat. It was gone. The theat
rical manag'-ment had taken It insido out
of the wet. thus flanking another brilliant
military movement.

ALL THE SPORTS OF THE DAY
DUNBLANE
RECEIVED A
BIG "BOOST"
Walter Jennings Retal ated by
Claiming; Decoy â Caldweli
St 11 Cut of Form.
The first race at Tanforan Park yester
day was responsible for considerable
"horse Bwapping." It was a six furlong
selling dash for two-year-olds, and in a
mild drive Walter Jennings' big colt Dun
blane llnished a length In front of Decoy,
with Tar Hill a close third. The winner
was enured to be sold for $300. and was
bid up to $1000 by Frank Doss, the owner
of the second horse. This caused the
placid features of Walter Jennings to
wear a ruflled look, and straightway he
strolled to the secretary's ofllce an-i put
in v claim for I>. coy. Doss, seeing that
lie was to have an empty stall on his
hands, claimed Tar Hill, owned by the
Cambridge stable. Decoy was entwrd
for (500. and adding to this amount firs',
money of the purse. j._s, ana vail of me
"run up" money, $500, Frank Doss re
ceived JIH2S for his colt. Tar Hill, entered
for $400. would cost his new owner T7^Â».
which was generally considered a pretty
fair bargain.
There wore many unpleasant features
about the balance of the sport, asldo from
the defeat of three warm favorites. Mr.
Caldwell spent three very uneven and un
happy hours with the barrier, and on one
or two occasiones his ragged work almost
caused a public demonstration. Th was
regrettable, for in the past the veteran
has done some brilliant starting,
In the fourth fixture on the card. Napa
max with Thorpe up made a marvelous
run, after being nearly left at tho post,
and on returning to the stand the "old

J...u!s Esell'a Meddler ruled a hot
favorite for the fifth event, but refused
to break and was left at thÂ« post. El

NEW PARK
WILL CLOSE
FOR A TIME
San Mateo Coursing Associa
tion Officials Prepare for
a Fresh Start.
Th* officials of San Mateo Coursing As
sociation do not expect to open the gates;
of their park next Sunday. The directors
will meet to-night and If they follow their
Inclinations will decide to promote no i
more coursing tor some weeks. The park
opened under circumstances which were J
anything but auspicious and has gained
but slowly in public estimation. The |
judging and slipping under John Grace \
Jr. and Arthur Massey, have been of the
highest standard and some of the best
dogs on the coast have run there, but â¢
the attendance grew slowly.
As the park has been operated at a
loss the wiser counsels among the direc
tors have been to close f<>r a time and
reorganize. This is the action which will
be recommended to-night.
The members of l:igleslde Coursing As
sociation, which controls the sport at
Ingleslde Park, held their annual meet- j
ing at Pythian Castle lust night. The di- i
rectors elected were: Dominick Shannon.
Charles K. .Morns. David Dillon. H. A. |
Deckelman and W. K. Thompson. Mr. i
Thompson succeeds William llalpin. who
declined renomination. This Is the only
change in the old directorate.
At a meeting of the Interstate Coursing
Club last night. John A. Klein was elect
ed representative of the club on the Cali
ifornia coursing committee, vice J. H.
Rosseter, resigned.
F. Bchoil was proposed for membership.
Arrangements for the running of the
John Grace cup stake and the Bell Hran
don cup stake will be perfected by the
executive committee of the club.

ment on Big Lines.
The Olympic Athletic Club directors are
sending invitations to the great athletic
institutions of the East asking for their
best boxers for a tournament to be held
here. The date has not been fixed defin
itely, but it will bo about the middle of
February. Leader John A. Hammersmith

Olympic Club officials agree to pay the
traveling expenses of contestants, in ad
dition to the necessary training expenses
for two weeks in this city. Trophies Will
be offered for each event in accordance
with the regulations of the Amateur Ath
letic Union. The bouts ' will be four
rounds each.
The rules of the union will govern the
contests, which will be divided into the
following classes: Bantam, not to exceed
US pounds; feather, not to exceed 125
pounds; light, not to exceed 135 pounds;
welter, not to exceed 14.'> pounds; middle,
not to exceed 15S pounds, and heavy, any
weight.
Entries will not he received later than
January 15. At the championship meet
ing in the East "Jim" Corbet! was the
referee. . it is expected that candidates
for ring honors will be plentiful, as the
local clubs are turning out many promis
ing boxers.
This will bo ladles* night at the club.
There will be an exciting game of Indoor
baseball and a more exciting match at
water polo in the big tank. The teams
will be made up from among the following
swimmers: George Hlnkel. Alex Pape,
C. K. Melrose. Lester Hammersmith.
George James, J. Hobson, D. Carroll. L.
Cooper, Charles Weidemann, Ed Con
nolly. A. W. Taylor, W. B. Taylor. W.
Leonard and George Crowell.
Sid Cavill, the club's swimming teacher,
recently from Australia, will show his
skill as a swimmer and diver. .

11 HIS MAJESTY" HAS
A GOOD SECOND ACT
HIS MAJESTY" is a comic opera
parted in the middle. There Is one
good act, the second, to hear
which one should curb one's pos
sible desire to leave after the Brat This
Introductory section l"ft me in a quandary
as to whefher the music might be im
proved by a hotter libretto or the libretto
assisted by better music. Perhaps I should
say more appropriate music, for the music
as it is, is good, but its merit is evident
only In the orchestration, which is ex
cellent, and at times distinguished. There
Is not that comic-opera flavor, that desir
able Quality of cistrhlnnâ . in the vocal
Side of the footlights that dowers a work
with longevity, and the efforts of the sing
ers avail not tO make tliÂ«- thing
Wot my part, 1 prefer to hear a good
song poorly sung than an indifferent one
well rendered, tor one's imagination can
supply the lack in one case, whereas in
the other there is nothing to do but pity
the afflicted artist. Then- Is a dearth Of
happy tuiu-s in "His Majesty." though a
few lack but little of the adequate spirit.
They are nor of the kind to gain plaud
its and pndse, and we must seek rise
where i". â !â¢ the qualities that make the i>i"
duction the acceptable one that it is. If
there were more stuff as good as the
opening duet of the sooond act the opera
would take a much higher place, and in
this division the author as well as the
composer is at his best. The business and
comedy here as wen as the music are ex
cellent
To Fay that there are good lines in tho
bo< k is not a compliment, though ;t Is
the best I can offer. A good libretto may
not be thus specifically judged; "pocil
lines" are only remarkable when rare.
Some nf the lyrics gr> smoothly, though
the rhythm is careless, and when double
and triple rhymes (the heavy artill* ry ..f
th<> librettist) are essayed they are uni
formly commonplace.
The principals do more or less good
work. Wolff is the same excellent s<
class comedian and Edith Mason Is
dainty in her rigid, fri^.d way. i
Fairbairn as the queen does not make aÂ»
much as she might of what should be an
excellent comedy part, and Miss Ladd.
denied the advantage of tights, does well
in a small part, though singing in h'-r
usual expressionless way. The chorus Is
as good us ever, singing with a mag
nificent volume and acting admirably.
Scenically the production Is more than
good, the credit thrrefor belong'ng to
Mr. King, whose work deserves the high
est commendation. The sets at the Grand
Opera-house are always well exeunt" ii
and In some Instances are notable in
composition, color and perspective.

FOURTH RECITAL OF
HOLMES QUARTET
Elegant Rendition of the Great
Brahms Sextet â Very Successful
Song Recital by Mrs. J.
E. Birmingham.
There was a musical object lesson prev
alent in yestÂ«T<l:ty's chamber music con
cert by the Holmes Quartet. This lesson
consisted of the remarkable contrast be
tween a string quartet in C by Mozart
and a sextet in B-flat by Brahms. It
was, so to speak, the contrast between
the antique and the modern. By antique
I do not wish to convey any idea of infe
riority, but merely to give a term to a
certain quality of music. When we listen
t>> Mozart's quintet we are Impi
with the gentleness of the motif, the
KncefulneM of ideas and the delicacy of
â  xpr* -smiik romantic thoughts. The
Brahms sextet gives us vigor, emphatic
punctuation arid distinct description of
emotional sentiments. Now the phrwefl
are alluring, ami then the tone mass In
comes commanding and imperative. The
pizzicato is us.-.l very judiciously, so as
to create a very striking effect. I would
term Mozart's a f.-minlne composition,
while Brahms' work Is a decidedly mascu
line creation.
This Brahms' sextet was the best work
the Holmes yuartet has attempted so far
It was rendered with the necessary vigor
and a delightful judgment In inteYpreta
tlon. Henry Holmes and his assistants
are entitled to much praise for their suc
cessful effort. The quartet was assisted
by \\ aldoman Und. second viola and
William Wertsch. second 'cello. The vo
calist was again Mrs. rharles Olcott Rich
ards, who sang Mendelssohn's "Minne-
Jied" and "Sulelka." . There was a marked
Improvement noticeable In Mrs. RtchardV
diction. It wns easier to understand thÂ©
words of her songs. The pre-eminent feat
ure of her Ringing Is splendid taste In ex
ecution. The accompanlste was Miss Con
stance Jordan, whose excellent work Is
too well known to need any detailed men

The high reputation which Mrs. J. E.
Birmingham possesses attracted a large
audience to Sherman & Clay Hall last
evening. Those who attended were not
disappointed if they expected to hear
singing: of as artistic a quality as was
ever heard in this city. Mrs. Birming
ham shows in every selection she renders
the thorough schooling she underwent
and the Intelligence with which shÂ©
grasped the ideas of her master* The
tone comes free and full from her lips
She brings it forward and produces it
with ease and without endeavoring to
sing for effect. It is the Inborn refine
ment in music which manifests Itself In
a quiet, unassuming rendition of good
works Another very agreeable character
istic of Mrs. Birmingham is the selection
of what may vulgarly be termed "simple
Kongs." These very simple works are the
most difficult to Interpret, and the lady
shows her remarkable facility by interest
ing her listeners as much in an unassum
ing composition as others do by resorting
to throat-breaking vocal acrobatics
Mrs. Birmingham was assisted by
Harry Girard, a young man who but re
cently arrived from New York, where his
fresh barytone .brought him laurels in the
concert field. His voice is remarkable bo
cause of its strength, and he shows much
temperament in his execution. There in
however, a slight trembling noticeable
during his singing, which has a certain
effect upon some people, but which from
an artistic standpoint Is not allowable l
think that Mr. < '.Irani can easily rid him
self of this defect, and. then his voice
having gained firmness, will count as the
foremost barytone on this coast at pres
ent. Mrs. W. J. Bachelder played the ac
companiments very satisfactorily.

ARE FAR IN
ADVANCE OF
THE RECORD
Some Changes in Position of
the Six-Day Riders at
New York.
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
NEW YORK. Dec. sâ The plodders at
Madison-square Garden are riding far
ahead of the record, as was expected.
There has been some change in the rela
tive position of the riders, and several of
them have left the track In the past
twenty-four hours. This afternoon there
was an accident, in which Jay Eaton,
then a lud ahead of all the others, wad
crowded to the edge of the track and
pitched from his wheel. Eaton, amid the
greatest excitement, tried to remount,
but found that his tire was flat, and be
fore he got another wheel he was four
laps to the rear.
The matter was taken to the referee by
Eaton, who. after several hours' consiJ
eration, ruled that the Eaton-Wallhour
team should take its place with the leaders.
This put the team back only one lap, thÂ«;
one by which it was leading at the time
the spill occurred, and the decision was
received with general protest on the part
of all the riders. Waller said he would
leave the track, but he was still riding
at a late hour to-night.
Walthour took the track for his team
for a couple of hours after the accident,
and at 6 o'clock Eaton relieved him and
started out to regain the team's lost lap.
Miller tacked on to him and held him
safely, but only after a territic spurt,
which several times got within the two
minute limit.
The leading four teams were seventy-six
miles ahead of the record at the close of
the forty-second hour. Glmm made the
former record in MM with 7C7 miles 600
yards to his credit.
Through a misunderstanding, the Eaton-
Walthour team lost the laps at about 7:39
o'clock. They were both off the track at
the same time, not knowing of one an
other's temporary retirement. Then an
hour later Eaton announced his retire
ment for good, saying that his fall of the
afternoon had left him so shaken that he
was too weak to continue. Walthour,
however, announced that he would keep
on after some of the "individual" money.
He got a bad fall at 10:15 o'clock, but was
able to remount and close up the gap that
the fail had occasioned.
ilarley Davidson, the Canadian, with
drew from the contest at 8 o'clock, having
329 miles anil live laps to his credit.
[Creamer withdrew from the race at 7
o'clock, but his team mate, Aronson, con
tinued to ride.
The riders were seventy-nine miles
ahead of the record at the end of the
forty-fifth hour, and at midnight the lead
ers were eighty-three miles ahead of the
record. Following is the 12 o'clock score:

COUNTY GAME
LAWS ARE IN
JEOPARDY
Supreme Court Decision May
Upset Police Regulations
in Many Counties.
Justice Temple of the Supreme Court
wrote an opinion yesterday in the Stanis
laus County anti-gume shipping case which
may be made far reaching. A short time
ago James Knapp, a market hunter of
Stanislaus County, in order to test the
ordinance, attempted to ship two ducks
to this city. He was arrested and sen
tenced to fine and Imprisonment. Th*
case went to the Supreme Court on a writ
of habeas corpus and the petitioner was
discharged by oral order from the bench.
The decision was not handed down until
yesterday, although sportsmen and offi
cers of half the counties of the State have
been anxiously awaiting it. The Interest
of the latter may be understood when It
is known that fourteen of the counties
have passed a law similar to that of
'Stanislaus, prohibiting the shipping oÂ£
game out of the county and forbidding tho
transportation companies receiving such
game for shipment.
The opinion handed down yesterday de
clares all such ordinances as the onÂ« con
tested illegal and void. More than this.
the language of Justice Temple leave*
room for conjecture in the matter of other
ordinances now on the records of the
counties and already projected. It prac
tically upsets the antl-pumpgun law of
Marln County and may possibly interfere
with the passing of a law llml^ng tho
amount hunters may kill for euch .lay. an
proposed in San Mateo County. Some of
the counties nave passed laws Increasing
the length of the cloÂ«Â«e season fur certain
kinds of game. By a careful reading of
the (tract of the opinion following the
constitutionality of these regulations Is
open to question and may possibly pro
voko contests. The principal features of
the decision are as follows:
Serious question has been mad* as to thÂ«
power of any county Hoard of Supervisors
to add either restraints or regulations to
the right to take or kill wild game, to tho*Â«
made by the Legislature. We do not find It
necessary tor the purposes of this rase to
decide this question. If such further re
strlctlons upon the right to kill game mar
be made by county .... such regula
tions must be reasonable, not oppressive to
any class, and must not contravene any
established policy of the State. Presumably
the two ducks were lawfully taken by James
Knapp In Stanislaus County. It in not
charged that they were hunted or killed
for the purpose of being transported without
the county, though such fact. If It existed.
would not have changed the result. Hnv
\nz taken th- game lawfully and at a ttm*
when it Is lawful for any one to shoot
ducks, the ordinance prohibiting their ship
ment is an unreasonable Interference with
the rights of private property, an unneces
sary restraint of trade. The statutes of thÂ«
State In regard to game prohibit the offer-
Ing for sale of game during the ttroe It is
unlawful to kilt such game. The State reg
ulations upon this particular subject seem
complete, and restrict th" rights of citizens
so far as was necessary to prevent the us*
lawful killing of game.
It was stated In the argument, substan*
tlally. that the ordinance Â«-,Â«Â« aimed at "pot
hunters." I understand this phrase coven
all except sportsmen, relatively a smaU
part of the community only are sportsmen.
A law or ordinance which Â» old dlscrlmln
ate In their favor would not be a propej
exercise of the so-called police power. II
that be the manifest or admitted purpos*
of the ordinance It Is void, for that reason
also.
Chief Justice Eeatty adds:
The people of th- State, bdnr thÂ» ownei
of it* wild raroe. it may be eoncedM thai
the State Legislature could annex any con
dition It chose to the privilege if taking It,
but a county ordinance forbidding alt p#r
sons under penalty to transport 111 law.

HIS TROUBLES
TO THE JURY
Story of How Turner
Robbed Him.
TOOK ALL OF HIS SAVINGS
BARBER SAYS HE WAS FOR
YEARS HIS VICTIMS DUPE.
Bcmarkable Statement of the Events
Which Are Alleged to Have
Unbalanced Defendant's
Hind.
-oseph P. Prenna went on the Btand in
l"*T*L Cook ' 8 co^rt yesterday and pro
ceeded to tell the jury the atory of how he
..ad become mentally unbalanced as the
result of the peculiar business methods of
Janus F. Turner as practiced In the lat
ter* dealings with the defendant, extend
lnÂ« over a number of years. He declared
that Turner had by his trickery and bald
laced deception succeeded In robbing him
of ail he possessed and then deliberately
threw him over, refusing to make even a
partial restitution or give his dupe any
satisfaction whatever.
Frenna. testimony was all concerning I
his f.nanclal dealings with the dead man.
He began his recital shortly after the
â¢ â¢penlng of court in the morning. J. H.
KUbcl, an unimportant witness, preceding ,
Him on the stand for a brief Btsslon. ana
when rourt adjourned In the afternoon he
was etill answering questions and volun
teering Information concerning the finan- j
cial inuie in which Turner had involved
him. to his utter ruin.
The barber testified that he first met :
Turner in lssu. being Introduced to him by â 
one McAvoy. an ex -policeman. Turner let
rrn grass grow under his ftet. for on Jan
uary 15 of that year he borrowed $5000 of
* renna. giving as security a piece of
property in Oakland. He kept coming
Â£* c * fjJJ" more, and soon owod Fronna
J;'** 0 - Jhen he proposed to bunch the en
ure Indebtedness In one note. Afterward
fr renna received $,V>oi) nnd a piece of prop
erty in Lav- County in lieu of the other
s*. **0.
Ip to this stage of the proceedings Dis
trict Attorney Murphy had remained a
f ilent listener, but when Attorney Hosmer
produced a deed to apiece of property
that hud been given to Frenna by Turner
*Â» security for a loan and offered It in
evidence he made a decided objection. Mr :
Ho?mer contended that It formed a por- I
tlun of the proof of certain transactions
which it wan claimed had caused the de
fendant to become temporarily Insane nx
the Ume he had inadvertently put an end
to the existence of tlie much-discussed i
Turner Judge Co<>k decided that undrr i
the ruling of the Supreme Court In the
Shattuek case all testlmonv of whatever
character tending to establish insanity of
the defendant was admissible, and' he
thÂ»fore overruled the objection.
The ten were down, and then followed
a Â»Â»ewUderlnÂ»c mass of testimony of such |
i*n intricate character that if the Jury I
<an unravel it without succumbing to
nervous prostration a miracle will have
|w n accomplished. Deeds, mortgage* re
i<Msrs. stipulations, nous. tÂ»l<'grams
lorreemoms. tax receipts and all manner I
ox papers were produced in rapid sucees
â¢inn. all of course tending to prove that
Turner was a crook and Frenna an in
n cent dujH?. who was justified in becom
ing insane. Hut the most remarkable de
\Â«!oj)ment of Freima's testimony. If it Is
to !>â¢â¢ U-lleved. was the childish" susccpti- I
bllity of th.* defÂ«?ndnnt in his dealing* '
with Turner, of which the documents of
fered In evidence purport to be the ma
ten*] proof.
Accnrdlng to thÂ«Â« testimony. Frenna
TrM discovered the perfidy of Tiirner after
re had loaned him a few thousand dollar? i
mi â ! jet. although lie stormed and threat!
er.-<J TurijÂ«-r. insteud of redÂ«Â»emlns spuri
'â¢uÂ« .'cr.'.s and squaring matters, simply
made fresh i>romi>eÂ« and then Induced
I i- :ma to advance additional rums on I
equally worthless security. Not once only
Li this done, but repeatedly, until Fren- '
:..i had loaned Turner Jl7.sm\ secured by '
iwo notes nnd a lot of worthless property '
Frenna said on th<* stand that at <>nÂ« time
be had deeds to about half of California
i ivrn him by Turner. Theuâ this* was In '
>.<:.-he had Turner arrested for forrerv I
although convicted in the Superior !
<"ourt. the Supreme Court reversed the '
'!â¢â¢< ision and nothing came of it. Even I
while the case was pending Turner con
tinued to pull the wool over the eyes of
iU+ man wno claims he wu being robbed '
*nd after the trial Frenna was induced to I
Lijv Btlll another gilded brick.
I renna has a sT'-nt deal more to tell the |
â¢r.ry. and will probably be on the stand I
r^veral days, and If here Is much more
of this kind of testimony the trial will be
proJnnKed indefinitely.

passage of the ordinance.
In the case of the "Park" bond election
notice there is do reference to any kind
of money whatever. No express warrant
Is there given for making those bonds
payable in anything other than what may
be legal tender. Whether in such case
"gold coin â¢ may be sped tied is a ques
tion which the highest courts of other
States have decided diversely and which
our Supreme Court has not passed upon.
Attorney Lane deems it the only safe
way to make no further partlcularlzation
as to money than is made therein.
Blanks nre also left In the notices for
denomination of thÂ» bonds and also in
one of the forms for the rate of Interest,
the rate in the other Instance having
been fixed by prior ordinance. Park
bonds can be of any denomination not ex
ceeding $KÂ«>). Tne other bonds cannot
be less than $100 each or more than $1000.

THINKS DODGE SHOULD PAY.
Julius Saulman Protests the Paying
of Salaries by the City to Poll
Tax Collectors.
Mayor Phelan Is In receipt of a com
munication from Julius Saulman, where
in the latter calls th.' Mayor's attention
to what he terms a misappropriation of
the city's finances and the depleting of
the treasury by the unwarranted and Il
legal methous of Assessor Dodge and
asks that tne Mayor Investigate the
charges and call a halt to a practice that
has already cost the city many thousand
dollars.
Mr. Saulman more specifically charges
that Assessor Dodge has in his employ
several deputies whose duties consist sole*
ly of collecting poll tax and thai their
salaries are paid out of the city's general
fund; that while the Assessor recolves 15
per cent of the entire amount of poll tax
s.i collected he pays nothing for the col
lection of the nine and the entire ex
po n^o is borne by the city.
At this time .if the year when but few
poll tax receipts nre sold It often happens
thai the deputy collects lens money during
the month than the amount which the
city pays him as a salary and 15 per cent
of the collections Is withheld as the As
sessor's commission, making the city
poorer than It would have been had no
deputy beÂ«-n employed Mayor Phelan
has promised to look Into the matter.

TANKER'S NERVE
IS SHAKEN WHEN
A WOMAN FAINTS
Scene at Opening of
Murder Trial.
LOUIS MILLE ON THE STAND
DR. ZABALA'S ABSENCE CAUSES
AN ADJOURNMENT.
Special Counsel for the People Says
That He Will Show That Jeal
ousy Was Responsible
for the Tragedy.
George L. Tanner, who shot and killed
James Brown and Fannie Barnes on
August 26 last in a little lodging house at
503 Folsom street, experienced various
emotions during the short time he was
on trial for murder before Judge Dunne
yesterday morning. The trial opened
shortly after 10 o'clock. George W. Rue
sell had taken the stand and pointed out
the various Important points on the dia
gram he had drawn of the scene of the
tragedy. Tanner sat rubbing his hands
nervously together, intently watching the
first witness against him, Louis Mllle.
when a scream behind him started him
from his chair. Miss Brown, a daughter
of the murdered man, anxious to see that
her loss through her father's murder was
avenged, had come into court, but the
strain proved too great for her nerves
and she swooned away.
The bailiff hurried to her assistance and
Just as he reached her she apparent
ly went into convulsions. Several men as
sisted In removing her to the adjoining
chamber and a physician was summoned
from the Receiving Hospital. Remedies
were administered and In a short time
she was able to be removed to her home.
The excitement occasioned by the scene
did not subside for some time. Finally,
however, the examination of the witness:
continued. He was the keeper of the
house In which the tragedy was en
acted, but an objection made by the de
fense prevented him from telling the
story of the crime.
Dr. Zabaia, autopsy physician of the
Morgue, was not present, and the defense
contended that as the corpus delect! had
not been established the testimony of the
witness was incompetent. Tne objection
was sustained and the witness left the
Stand. Dr. Zabaia will testify as to the
death of the murdered man and woman
to-day and give evidence as to the cause
thereof, after which the trial will proceed
with Mllle on the stand.
J. X. B. Wilson appeared as special
counsel for the prosecution, and said that
he would show that the murder was ac
tuated by jealousy and that the accused,
who is an old man. moved next door to
the place occupied by his victims with the
sole Intention of murdering them.
TO IMPROVE MISSION STREET.
The Official Grade and Modern Pave-
ment Are Demanded.
The committee for the Improvement of
Mission street met in the oillco of the
Merchants' Association yesterday. Pres
ent were Herbert E. Law, J. P. Merrill
and \v. J. Lowrj of the committee. Â«â¢ S.
Chamberlain, representing th.; wood
block pavement, was also present. The
grade of Mission street was discussed and
a communication was submitted from the
Surveyor's office relative to the grading of
the street.
It was suggested that It would be a
good plan, after the charter goes into
effect, trt have the city put the street on
the official grade. A motion was adopted
that the City Engineer be requested to
furnish a diagram showing how much
each corner of the streets intersecting
Mission street In below the official grade.
Mr. Law stated that the Sharon estate
heirs, and also Wells, Fargo & Co., have
expressed themselves as willing to co-
Operate with the committee In any man
ner possible. He suggested that the pe
tition for the signatures of the property
owners be drawn up In two parts; one
for the rejmvement of the street and the
oth*r for cutting off the sidewalk. Messrs.
Merrill and Lowry were appointed a spe
cial committee to Interview Mayor Phe
lan upon the probability of securing as
sistance from the city for the improve
ment of Mission street after the charter
Â£"> s Into effect.
The secretary was Instructed to notify
the committee as soon as he received
from the City Engineer the diagram
showing the grades of Mission street, so
that a meeting may be held for the con
sideration of the same. The length and
extension of the seawall were discussed.
It was ascertained that the same extends
from the foot of Taylor street to within
75 feet of the northerly line of Mission
street. y

MARRIED WOMEN
NEED NOT APPLY
OAKLAND, Dee. 6.â An effort made by the Oakland Board of Educa
tion last night to revise the rules of the Oakland School Department
resulted In only a revision and Intensification of the rule that makes
the unmarried teacher the only available article In Oakland educa
tional circles.
School Director Wakefleld. who Is himself the only unmarried member of
the Board of Education, appeared as the champion of the married women.
He wanted the rules of the Oakland School Depart) â¢ amended so that mar
ried women could be employed in the schools, and he introduced a resolution
to that effect.
Then the board went Into executive session for fear that pome one might
overhear the discussion upon this <)< licit* point. The other members of the
l.fard. some of whom had long bÂ«-e;i \n the service of the schools and were
rf fj>fÂ»nFll>le for the enactment .>f this rule, took the unmarried Director
Wakcfirld Into a side room and toM him why no married women were wanted
and why only young, pretty and unmarried teachers should be permitted to
teach the young Idea how to shoot In Oakland.
There is one woman upon 'â¢â¢ School Hoard. Mrs. Dr. Myra Knox, and
phe seconded the efforts of Mr. WakeJield to remove the prohibition upon
married women.
Hut what happened In the pecrÂ»*t session the School Directors do not want
tn pay. Hut there were enough votes to overcome the proposition /if
Directors Wakefleld and Kik>x <md the married women were vanquished. The
rule will stand and no married women need apply at the Oakland School
Department-

WHIPPLE MAY
HAVE TO PAY
FOR PLAYING
Faculty Will Consider
His Case.
CAPTATN *vnirH,K.
BERK] : Dec. 6.â Speculation Is rife
among the students of thÂ« university as
to the action taken and to be tuk. -ri by
the authorities in the case of Captain
Whipple of the football team, who ren
dered himself liable to censure by dis
obeying the rder of the committee on
student affairs forbidding him to play in
the Thanksgiving game. Captain Whip
ple hati always stood well with the fac
ulty heretofore, but this year his numer
ous cares in looking after the interests
of tila team so occupied his time that he
fell below grade in his university stand
ing. The faculty rules are very stringent,
and Captain Whlpple's prominence and
prestige were of bo avail to save him
from their operation, and so he was con
fronted with the dilemma of either defy
ing thiÂ» ruling or giving up his place In
the great game. Ills choice of the latter
alternative broke off peaceful relation*
with the faculty, and Colonel Edwards,
tho chairman of the committoe on stu
dent nifalrs. at once went to the manage
ment of the Stanford team and endeav
ored to persuade them to protest against
Whlpple when he came on the gridiron.
The Stanford men could not see that it
was within their province to do so, and
the attempt of the California professor to
carry his point by this means was made
tho subject of some very unpleasant per-
Bonaiiti'Â». Contradictory rumors were
flying about the campus to-day concern
ing Whipple's suspension and probable
expulsion He loft tewn Immediately after
the cam*! and Ik supposed to be ..waiting
the faculty's action at his home near On
tervi: I'rofcssor Thomas It. Bacon of
the students' affairs committee said to
night that his committee had taken no
action with regard to the matter, which
would be taken up and passed upon at a
meeting of the entire faculty next Friday.
President Wheeler would express no opin
ion on the caM except to deny that he
had suspended (Vhjpple or hud forbidden
him the campus. He said that the ath
lete's own action in going into the (tame
had severed his connection with the uni
versity until further notice and that his
absence in the meantime was simply dic
tated by good taste.
Ipple Is a member of the class of
IWO, and would have graduated In May
but for th. present Interruption.
Student sentiment upholds the. action of
the splendid athlete who sa.-rifWd so
much, to secure the 30â0 victory, but the
general opinion Is that he will be made
an example of, probably by a year* sus
pension. '

the House hill and beyond this, ho said,
the Ijills proceeded substantially on the
Kaine lines, the differences beini? tbota <>f

belief that these differences could readily
be adjusted in a conference committee.
The Michigan Republican delegation In

SEATTLE SHIPWRIGHTS
GO TO MARE ISLAND
VALLEJO, Dec. 6.â Ten shipwright*
from Seattle arrived at Mare Island and
registered to-day. The force on the Hart
ford numbers about twenty. They are
pronounced far Inferior to the men who
loft the Job. Workmen a:<- still tearing
out planks from the ship and it U believ
ed sÂ«he will not leave here until after tho
new year, although the Bastern dis
patches state that she Is scheduled to
leave on the UOth lust. Shipwright** who
left off work on the Hartford and were
prohibited from employment at Mare Isl
and on that account for one year, will
probably be allowed to register for re-em
ployment In a few days to be re-employed
whenever their services are required.
The discharge of sixty Ironworker's,
mostly machinists, occurred to-day at
Mure Island In the department of steam
engineering. The cause Is a lack of or
den from Washington, no work en hand
and no allotment of funds to proceed with
It.

ALVARADO MAY
HAVE A DIRECT
LINE BY WATER
Sugar and Water
Company May Act.
ALVARADO. Dec. s.â This town has
been suddenly thrown Into a fever of ex
citement over reports that would seem to
Indicate bright prospects for cheaper
freight rates from this point to San Fran
cisco by rail and water, and In direct com
petition with the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
Great Interest has been aroused In the
purchase by the Alameda Sugar Company
of a strip of land fifty feet wide from the
Migar works to tide water. In view of the
announcement made by the Contra Costa
Water Company that the latter would
ship fuel to thla point by water If such
became possible, and, further, in view of
the complaints of the sugar people to the
effect that the railroad has been getting
all the profit for hauling their product
from the mill. It la believed here that the
sugar company Is preparing to enter the
railway business on a small scale by mak
ing rail connections of their own with a
water route to San Francisco.
The purchase of the strip of land men
tioned was made with the announced In
tention of making a sewer outlet to the
bay; but the fact of the width of the strip,
together with the dissatisfaction directed
to the railroad, has given rise to many
conjectures, one of which, that seems
most plausible, being that a railroad way
Is to be constructed.
Railroad rates have been advancing
steadily, until now the sugar company
claims that there is but little chance for
it to compete with other concerns. They
argue If they can reach the bay and then
by water carry their product to San
Francteco they will be independent of the
Southern Pacific Company. Moreover, It
is argued that returning vessels could
easily carry fuel for both the sugar com
pany and the water company at much
tower rates than are In effect now. A sav
ing could thus be made at both ends.
Atfaln, if such a line were opened most of
the merchandise for local merchants
would be shipped here by this new route.
John L. Howard, president of the AJa
ineda Sugar Company, when seen at his
home on Vernon Heights to-night, was
Inclined to deny the railway story and
asserted that the strip of land was pur
chased solely for the purpose of a rlsfht
of way for a pipe from the workÃ to the
water, by which to carry off the refuse

SPAT.ON THE SIDEWALK
AND WAS ARRESTED
J. L. Ramsuer Taken Into Custody
for Violating a Municipal Ordi
nance.
Chief I^eÂ«e says he has concluded to put
a stop to expectorating on the sidewalks of
this city. The frequent complaints received
from citizens who complain that the mu
nicipal ordinance Is not being enforced
has led the head of the department to ls-
BUC orders to Captains Spillane, Wlttman
and Uillen to notify the men to arrest
any man they sec using the sidewalks
fur a cuspidor.
Captain Splllane's lecture to his squad
on the importance of eradicating the evil
bore fruit la*>t nighu when Officers Thom
as Murphy and J. C. Laws arrested J. L.
Itamsuer, a saloon keeper, and Fred Mul
lls, an lronraolder, for the offense.
It is the intention of the police to press
the charge. In the hope that if an exam
ple is made of the two men further viola
tion of the ordinance will be stopped.

THREATEN TO PREVENT
THE BOND ELECTIONS
Merchants Create Consternation
by Unique Proceedings.
Registrar Has Already Made an Enormous
Deficiency, Which Must Be Greatly
Increased This Month.
SOMETHING In the nature of a .
bomb has fallen In the midst of i
the officials at the City Hall, j
Tradesmen who for years have j
furnished the city government |
with supplies and are living In unsatisfied
hep* that some day they may be paid,
threaten now to make reprisals which will
throw well laid plans and prospects Into
'hÂ»o,'. These merchants are threatening
that unlefcs they are paid they will f.le a
f-ult and secure an injunction preventing
the bond elections which are scheduled for !
the latter part of this month. While the |
merchants are not yet ready to carry |
their scheme Into execution, their threat 1
is considered to be cf very* serious mo- j
xnent, as lawyers and men well Informed
in municipal law are inclined to believe
that an injunction from a competent tri
bunal can prevent the bond elections tor
which such elaborate preparations have
been made.
While it Is admitted that the Supreme
Court has already decided that no obsta
cle shall bo placed In the way of the
people when they wish to mako known 1
their desires In an election. It is feared :
that the startling proposition of the angry j
merchants pretents a new problem not |
yet answered by the Supreme Court, j
Whatever the outcome may be, It has ,
even in its present form given cause for ;
a great deal of ofilcial unrest.
At the beginning of this fiscal year the
election machinery of the city wa*> in first i
class condition. The Election Commission j
owed nothing and the Board of Supervls- j
or* had only to provide money enough to
conduct the four elections provided for
during the fix months now ending. These >
elections were the primary for both par- !
tie*, the general election tor the selection !
of municipal authorities and the two bond !
elections which have been set by the I
Board cf Supervisors for this month.
For all of these elections the Supervis
ors made the absurdly low appropriation
of JGS.fcOO. Facts and figures were pre
sented by th<* Registrar to show that it !
was Impossible to hold the four elections !
for this sum of money. No more would ;
bo given, however, and the election au- â 
thcrltlcs had to be content. They had. i
however, one tremendous advantage. If i
they exceeded their appropriation they I

KLONDIKER LUNNUN ADMITS
HOW SOFT A MARK HE WAS
ff s? BKBI I,UXNUN*. a truest at
FT I.VNNrN. and one of
Ban Boon Â«nd one of
ca*iÂ«Â»st thing* . that ever
O ii t-wung out of the Arctic Cir
cle, put In an hour yesterday
In Police Judge Graham's court telling
what n soft mark he had been for
Henry Rurke. alias Charles Nile*, a
prisoner In the dock.
Th<- recital was as good as a fare**
rnmody. and his Honor and the court
room crowd were kept on the broad
grin at the Klondikt-r's confessions of
verdancy. Kunnun himself was BMP*
pHle.l to smile at the good thing he
ha<! l*Â»en. -.
ThÂ« story he told was a long on*.
Ftartlng from the time he got In from
the Klondike with his pockets full of
du*t until he discovered the duplicity
of nurke. By chance he met that indi
vidual one day. and Burke, after mak
ing the Klondlker believe he was an
ex-soldier back from Manila, com
menced operations by touching I,un
nun for the price of a Bhave. He fol
lowed this up by dining with the miner
Â«nd sleeping with him. putting up far
the bed and board a woeful taJe of
longtime starvation.
Next morning., as I*unnun said, he
routed cut Burke, gave, him a dollar
and told him to hunt for work. The.
ex-soldlcr came back, saying he had
found It. borrowing $5 on the strength
of his representations and keeping up
his little touches on various flimsy
pretexts, all of which have since been
were absolutely sure of being paid. The
law provides that all salaries shall be
paid out of the general fund, and It makes
no difference out of what fiscal year the
money shall be paid. It Is different under
the consolidation act with merchants.
They must be paid out of the funds of the
fiscal year in which the Indebtedness was
incurred.
Having this advantage the election au
thorities proceeded, knowing, however,
that they would far exceed the appropria
tion made for them. They were perfectly
correct in their estimates. The primary
elation cost $12,000 and the peneral elec
tion cost JiC.O&O. a total of $104,000. The
Election Commission has already exceed
ed Its appropriation therefore, by $37,500
and the bond elections have not yet been
held. It is estimated that both of them
will cost a total of $3C'.O>.K). hut it Is safe to
â ay that they will cost more.
Whatever they coal they will simply
add to the deficiency of $37,500 already
created. The total deficiency will con
sequently be at least $C7,f>oo, which is more
than the entire appropriation for the gen
eral ejections. This money must be paid
out of the general fund and the army of
tradesmen who furnish supplies to the
prisons and hospitals and all other muni
cipal departments must skirmish for their
money.
The merchants realize very clearly that
the craeh will not come until the end of
the fiscal year. A bitter experience has
taught them this fact and they ure not
anxious to repeat It. They intend, there
tore, to prevent the bond elections if they
can by injunction. They understand the
difficulty of doing This. tÂ»ut if they carry
their threat into execution they an at
least crer.te trouble. In a measure they
have been mollified by a promise that In
the near future provision will be made for
them by a bond Issue.
They have seen how hopeless it is to
expect payment for supplies furnished In
previous fiscal years. No relief has been
given by special legislation and none ha*
been found in actions before the courts.
It has been proposed, therefore, that the
aggregated bills of merchants against the
city be paid by an Issue of bonds. This
may ward off the threatened attack of the
tradesmen, but If it does not an interest
ing time may be expected between now
and the day set for the first bond elec
tion.
ing. which takes place on Saturday. After
discussing the matter it was decided that
eeverai typewritten copies of the report
be distributed to members of the board,
who would then be able to give the mat
ter the consideration its Importance de
served.
A communication from Librarian Fred
erick Toggart was then read proposing
that thÂ« board establish branch libraries
in country towns which have no such in
stitutions. Mr. Tergart suÃgested that
each member ho allowed four books a
week, which when finished would be
passed on .to the next town and so on
forming a circulating library like those
operated successfully in the East The
manor will be referred to the library
committee. r
Slashed Her Own Wrist.
A woman named Mattie Foy attempted
suicide In a saloon at 103 Grant avenue
early Tuesday morning by slashing her
wrist. Her life was saved by the prompt
action of George Blomqulst. who happen
ed to be In the place. After her effort
proved futile the woman rushed from the
place and entered the saloon kept by
Billy Abbott, where she was arrested by
Police Officers Edwards and Geimann
; and taken to the California street sta
tion.
Robbed by a Woman.
Late Rtaturday night a Klondike nam
ed Wellington Mazza was robbed by a
woman named Ford on California street.
between Dupont and K<arny. The matter
was reported to the California police sta
tion and officers are looking for the
woman.
Mazza. who accumulated considerable
money while In the Northern mining re
gion, came to this city â  short time ago
Saturday night he left his hotel and vis
ited snme of the saloons in thÂ« vicinity
of Dupont and Pine street. He drank con
proved false. He became bolder and
got Lunnun to give him $11, with which
he redeemed his watch, after which
operation he borrowed $13 more from
the Klondlker. Later on he made sev
eral other descents on the miner's
pocketbook, finally concluding, the wit

coin and $50 worth of nuggets as he
slept In his room at the Russ House.

story, denying everything. He said
he was sober Thanksgiving night: that

MRS. PHELAN'S
LONG LIFE IS
EBBING AWAY
Mayor Watches by
Her Deathbed.
DAUGHTERS NOT AT HOME
FAMILY HAD ARRANGED A
CHRISTMAS REUNION.
â¦
The Banquet to the Municipal
Officers-Elect Has Been Post
poned Indefinitely by Mayor
Phelan.
â¢
Mr.". James Phelan. mother of the
Mayor, suffered a serious relapse early
yesterday ni<irnlng, and her physicians at
once declared that there was no hope of
her recorerjr. Throughout the day she i
lay unconscious, between life and death. I
hut last night a slight relief of the ex
treme congestion was noted, although the
doctors would not acknowledge that it
was ground for hope.
The severe illness of Mrs. Phelan is |
especially unhappy at this time, as a
grand family reunion had been planned
for Christmas. At present none of the
children axe home, with the exception of
the Mayor. Miss Mollie Phelan has been
in Europe for over two years and left
Hamburg last Saturday for home. Mrs.
F. J. Sullivan, the other daughter, has
left for New York to meet her sister, and
they cannot return, under the most fa
vorable circumstances, for at least a
week.
Mr?. Phelan has been seriously ill forÂ»
some weeks, and on more than one oc
casion her life was despaired of, but no â 
attack has h.-cn so severe as that of yes- ;
terday morning. Drs. Bazet and Devlin i
and Mayor I'h. Lan were at the dying wo
man s bedside throughout the day and in
the evening their watch was joined in by
J-olonel Ktil ll van, secretary of the Mayor
Ihe greatest anxiety of the family
was in regard to the absent daughters
and that the* might return in time to
Be* their mother In life once more.
Mrs. Phelan has lived In San Francisco
and Its vicinity since pioneer day? Her
5 husband camV to the mines in 1MÂ«
and shortly afterward he went East and
married bringing Mrs. Phelan to this
City, where she has mostly resided ever
since tor many years Â»f 6 has divided !
ncr time between the fam residence on
\alencla street and her place in San Ma
teo (. OUntr. Slip has never been desirous
Â°L P" bll< :lt. v . mid even her many acts of !
charity have 1,, on devoid of any osten- !
atlon Mrs. Phelan's affiliation with fit.
Irnatlus Omrch is probably of longer l
duration than that of any odher member
she having born for years a pewholder
n the old building on Market street that
â led the handsome structure on
Hayes street. S-he haw made many gifts
to St. Ignatius and until his death two
years SCO, her favorite priest was Father
MUraskey, who was her spiritual adviser
for a generation. It was at St. Ignatius
that Mayor I'helan was educated, and
until a few weeks ago Mrs. Phelan w.-is
a regular attendant at the church that
contained for her so many associations
and where ) n the past she had worshiped
with her husband.
Mrs. Phelmn'i advanced age Is greatly
against her chances of recovery, she hav
ing been born In Ireland seventy-three
years ago.
Mayor Phelan was to hav^ presided last
evening at a banquet to which he had
called and bench warrants were issued
for them, returnable at 2 o'clock In the
afternoon, the court before taking a
recess announcing that there might be
"somethln' doin' " later with Captain
Btoant.
When court reconvened only one of
Attorney Curtis' witnesses was pres
ent. He was Corporal Tyson, and he
came far from proving the alibi sought
to be established by the defense. He
eaid merely that he had seen Andrew
Jaskson take his shoes off Thanks
giving night as if going to bed.
In rebuttal the prosei-ution put on
four witnesses who added their testi
mony to that of the others that the
defendant had shot at Stanton and
Alexander. Daniel Jackson was one of
these; Harry Briggs, bartender for Al
White, was another; James Good and
James Burns completed the quartet.
Daniel Jackson explained that the rea
son he had not answered the sub
pena was because his captain had or
d. red him to camp and ordered him
under arrest on a charge almost for
gotten. At this statement the court
boiled over and said things about Cap
tain Blount. II- nry Morris, an earlier
witness in the caso, also informed the
court that he had been ordered under
arrest by Blount for attending the
trial on the pretext that he was away
from camp without leave.
Judge Conlan then ordered the issu- <
ance of a warrant for Blount and held '
Andrew Jackson to answer. <
The Forty-ninth being so near the '
time for embarkation for the Philip- ]
pines, it is suspected that Captain <
Blount may attempt to evade the serv- <
ice of the warrant by taking refuge <
under the wing of the military law ,
In such an event there may be a pretty <
crash between civil and military au- <

NEW PIPE LINE
Injunction Against Bear
Gulch Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. Dec. sâ ThÂ« Bear
Gulch Water Company, now engaged in
replacing the old seven-inch pipe with
lifteen-ineh pipe, will be compelled to re
lay Its new pipe on the lino of the old
and will not be permitted to lay another
line of pipe adjacent to the old one.
In the Superior Court to-day Judge
Buck granted the injunction prayed for
by the Spring Valley Company, thereby
restraining the Bear Gulch Company from
laying its new pipe in any other place
than that set forth in the old right of
way, which was obtained in 1567.
A question that neatly interests the
people of Menlo Park was touched upon
hut not decided during the present court
proceedings. It is the amount of water
to which the Bear Gulch Company is en
titled under the old decree of condemna
tion. The Spring Valley Company claims
that the Bear Gulch Company never ob
tained by the decree in condemnation the
right to take one drop of water oft the
lund on the banks of the stream, but that
by prescription they have the right to
take seven inches, the size of the present
pipe, and no more; this for the reason
that in the original condemnation pro
ceedings all riparian owners were not
made parties and hence there are wirae
who are still entitled to all the water over
and above seven inches.

State University a few months ago. The
balance of the stock is held by Charles
W. Felton of Menlo Park. There prom
ises to be further litigation before the
matter is finally settled.
