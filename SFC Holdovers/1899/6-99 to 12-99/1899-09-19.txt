SECOND WARSHIP
WILL PROBABLY BE
SENT TO VENEZUELA
So Serious Has the Revolution Become That the Appre
hension Is Shared by All Diplomats at Caracas,
and the American Minister Will
Hurry to His Post.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARACAS. Sept. 18. â The United States cruiser Detroit
arrived to-day. Government forces have reoccupied
Puerto Cabello. Troops are being mobilized at Vic
toria under General Luciano Meridoza. Puerto Cabello is a sea
port and was reported taken by the insurgent general. Cipriano
Castro, on Saturday. On Sunday he was reported as having
reached Maracai, which lies between Puerto Cabello and Vic
toria.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18.â While a serious condition
of affairs exists in Venezuela the authorities say that American
interests are not in danger to such an extent as to justify a naval
demonstration being made in Venezuelan waters. Only a re
quest for another warship made by Commander Tlemphill, com
manding the Detroit, will cause the issuance of an order to the
gunboat Nashville to proceed to Puerto Cabello. Commander
Hemphill, who reached La Guayra to-night, will make an inves
tigation of the situation and wire the result to Washington.
Advices from Mr. Russell, American Charge d' Affaires,
are not conclusive, but they show that his apprehension is
shared by other diplomats in Caracas, and he has confirmed The
Call's dispatch that the Ministers of Great Britain and Germany
have wired their Governments for warships. The information
of the State Department is to the effect that the insurgents have
occupied Valencia and Puerto Cabello and are now moving
along the railroad connectin Valencia with Caracas. Xo sur
prise would be experienced if another battle should occur at
Victoria.
Francis B. Loomis. American Minister to Venezuela, was at
the State Department to-day in consultation with officials. Mr.
Loomis considers the situation sufficiently grave to require his
departure at once for his post, and he left Washington this af
ternoon for Xew York, where he will take the first steamer for
La Guayra.
Official information shows that the revolution owes its suc
cess to a combination of the forces of Generals Castro and Her
nandez. Castro's army was badly beaten some weeks ago, and
it was believed that it could not reorganize. About the same
time the Government arrested Hernandez and some of his
friends in Caracas. It is presumed that the followers of Her
nandez immediately joined Castro and that the insurrectionary
movement thus attained sufficient force to succeed, as it has
done.

The Cape Town correspondent of the j

NEW YORK. Sept. 18.â A World ca
ble from London says: Transvaal's
firm refusal of Great Britain's latest
demands has undoubtedly provoked
both anxiety and surprise among the
jingoes here. Their absolute conviction
had been that President Kruger would,
however unwillingly, accept Secretary
Chamberlain's veiled ultimatum, or
would at any rate send some temporiz
ing reply, enabling England to com
hT preparations to crush the
South Africa n re public.

is possible; but tho British Cabinet
cannot now recede from the position to
which Chamberlain committed the
Ministry in his latest dispatch, and he
is declared to have made the refusal
r . f all outside arbitration an essential
condition of his continuance in office.
In fa<-t tho idea of arbitration has been
entirely ignored by the British news

obviously paralyzed by tho tone and

OLIVE SCHREINER'S
PLEA FOR THE BOERS
LONDON. Sept 18. â CHive Sehreiner
(Mrs. Cronwright) contributes an elo
quent cable letter on the situation to
the Manchester Guardian. She says:
"Let England clearly understand
what war in South Africa means. The
largest empire the world has ever seen
will hurl its full force against a small
state and about 30.000 men, including
lads of sixteen and old men of sixty,
without a standing army or organized
commissariat. The entire little people
will have to resoive itself into an army
of their wives and daughters, who will
prepare the bread and meat the farmers
will put in their saddle-bags when they
go to meet the enemy. To-day the wo
men of the Transvaal are demanding
guns that they may take their part in
the last stand. We may crush the little
people with the aid of Australians and
Canadians, since the British Isles seem
unable to crush them alone. We may
take their land and lower the little flag
of his independence, so dear to the
Boer, but we shall have placed a stain
upon our own that centuries will not
wash out. Only the international spec
ulator who, through persistent misrep
resentations and by means of the press,
has wrought this evil, will gain and fill
his already overloaded pockets with
South African gold."

PARIS. Sept. IS.â The Senate met [

charge of conspiring against the Gov

the Senators* places were filled a few
minutes before 2 o'clock. Then the roll
of a drum was heard in the distance.

The cells are comfortably furnished. I
M, BERNARD, PROCURATEUR-GENERAL OF FRANCE,
He Is conducting the prosecution of twenty-two politicians who are now
on trial on a charge of conspiring to overthrow the Government.
The floor is covered with linoleum and
the walls are hung with greenish cloth.
- The furniture consists of an iron bed
stead, an easy chair, a marble-topped
toiiet table, a cuspidor and a ru?. Thus
| the prisoners will have little to com
j plain. of, and may congratulate them
l selves that times have changed since
i the Girondists were confined in the pal
! ace of the Senate by Robespierre dur
-1 ing the reign of terror and languished
I in its dungeons, and since Marshal Nev
j was immured in an unventilated cell
until led forth to be shot in the gardens.
There were people who, while loung
ing in the corridors just after the Sen
ators were supposed to have entered
behind closed doors, though in reality
they were taking the air outside for a
few minutes, remarked that conspira
cies to overthrow the existing regime
were apparently regarded as a much
less serious matter nowadays than in
times past.
The most rigorous precautions were
taken for the safety of the Senate
building this afternoon. It was cor
doned by police, who were stationed
I every few yards, while every gate lead
ing to the Luxembourg Palace was
guarded by a detachment of municipal
guards. Nobody was allowed to enter
the courtyard or even remain in the
precincts of the palace without a card of
entry. Consequently a small crowd wit
nessed the arrival of the Senators, who
alighted from the carriages and entered
the palace without demonstration
of any sort except the raising of hats
by a few of the spectators. The ticket
holders, after crossing the main court
yard, had to traverse the dark entrance
hall, passing between a double row of
j stacked rifles, behind which, barely dis
tinguishable in the gloom, were silent
figuresâ a strong detachment of the
municipal guards in their blue uniforms
decorated with red cord. The ushers
on the staircases repeatedly examined
their tickets.
President Fallieres opened the pro
ceedings amid general silence by read
ing the decree of the President of the
republic constituting the Senate, on the
report of the Minister of Justice, into
a high court to try the charge against
the accused of making an attempt on
the security of the state.
PRICE FIV r E CENTS.
M. Fallieres then declared the Senate
constituted as a high court, and the.
clerk of the court called the roll of Sen
ators, who answered with the word
"present."
There was momentary excitement
when President Fallieres concluded
reading the President's decree. A
Rightist Senator, M. Lamarzelle. began
to speak, and M. Fallieres said sharply.
'"I cannot hear you," and the Leftists
insisted, and M. Fallieres again said:
"I cannot hear you," and the Lefists
shouted "Order! Order!"
A Rightist Senator, Provost de Lau
nay, thereupon cried, pointing to the
Leftists. "There axe our judges!"
At this the!* 1 was a general shout of
"Oh!" and "Silence!" from the Leftists
and the galleries, the public and mem
bers of the pres.-i. the latter being
throughout the pn edings more audi
ble than the Senators themselves. M.
Fallieres, however, with a rapping of
his mallet, quickly restored order.
The leading absentees, when the mii
was called. were MM. Conatans.
Scheurer-Kestner and Mercier.
Then the door through which M. Fal
lieres entered was again opened wide
j and three tall figures, in loner scarlet
robes, appeared on the threshold and
with stat-ly mien marched into the hall
and, ascending the steps of the plat
: form, took up their places on the right
j hand of the president.
The first was M. P.^rnard. the
| Procurateur-General. who was a hand
! some figure in his scarlet robe
| trimmed with a broad strip of er
! mine. The two substitutes with
I him wore scarlet gowns trimmed
; with black and having no ermine. M.
i Bernard immediately began to read the
indictment in a monotonous voice.
The indictment commenced by recit
j ing the facts of the arrest of MM. De
| roulede and Marcel-Habert. and said
the inquiry had shown the existence of
a conspiracy to change the form of
government, to which the disorders of
last February, it was added, were due.
! and in which MM. Deroulede. Marcel
j Habert and some members of the
â  League of Patriots, M. Guerin and
some members of the Anti-Semite
League, M. Duboc and some members
of the Society of Anti-Semitic Youth.
MM. Buffet, Godefrey and Chevilly and
j members of the Royalist party, were
inculpated. All the societies mentioned
i since 1898, it was pointed out. had aban
doned electoral action for revolutionary
action, and the League of Patriots
openly pursued the object of over
throwing the constitutional govern
ment, MM. Deroulede and Marcel-Ha
bert seeking to attain their ends by the
union of rioters and troops in the
streets. The Anti-Semitic League, it
was also claimed, has joined the insur
rectional organization, wherewith are
associated the Nationalists. Royalists
and Imperialists League and the Anti-
Semitic Youth.
M. Duboe, it was further charged, is
the link between the anti-Semite and
patriotic leagues.
The indictment then gave a few par
ticulars of the provisional organization.
Referring to the Royalist League it
said it was worthy of attention because,
though the idea of a monarchic restora
tion appeared inconceivable, it had
played a preponderant role in the re
cent events, its leader being the Duke
of Orleans himself and its managers
his accredited representatives. All tha2
ORLEANS GAID TO
BE WITH GUERIN
Royalist Pretender Reported to
Be Shut Up in port
Chabrol.
m PARIS, Sept. is.â S.-vora! papers to-day revived the rumor that the g
5 Puke of Orleans is shut up with M Guerin in Fort Chabrol, the head- .%
i* quarters of the Anti-Semite League which has been besieged since An- Â£
6 gust 12. Nn definite 3tatemenl was made to this effect, and the papers '\
merely hinted that it might be true, basing their Idea on the statement ,;_â¢
*â¢ that the Duke of Orleans has not been heard ?v,>r,\ for mere than a â¢*
-. ;:th. The same rumoi >>n a previous occasion was utterly discredited. '\
Â£ Since then s.vera: persons have entered Fort Chabrol ami have not Been Â«>
Â»? the Duke. As a matt.-v o f fact the 1 uike of Orleans has been heard of â¢"
several tines. T Luynes, "lie of his intimate friends, said on S'
5 August 30 that the Duke of Orleans was in Austria. The silence of the q
royalist at this stage is not surprising, and is not taken to be .'
'â ;. nj ground for supposing him to be with Guerin. <|
league, it *vas assprtou, '8K to cnange
the form <â .;â  government by street
risings.
A letter from the Duke of Orleans to
hfs representative, M. Buffet, written
from Marienbad in July, 1896, instruct
ing him to commence a royalist organi
sation, was read and then other secret
Instructions, In which it was stipulated
that the sum to be spent was not to
exceed 300,000 francs.
The mention of this figure evoked
laughter from the Senators and others
present.
"Throe hundred thousand francs
would be cheap," was the remark heard
from the press gallery.
M. Fallieres tapped for silence and i
M. Bernard continued to review the |
royalist agitation at the end, of 1898, i
showing that M. Buffet, October 24 and j
October 26. telegraphed in code to the ;
Duke of Orleans, who was then in Bo- !
hernia, to come to the frontier, October
25 being the date of the anti-Semitic j
and Royalist disturbance on the Place j
de Concorde. On December 12 there
was further disorder, a mob marching
on the Cherche Midi prison crying
"Vive le Due d'Orleans!" The police
stopped the mob but M. Chevilly wired
to the Duke of Orleans: "Success
a'estime; 2000 demonstrators; police
stopped them, but will recommence."
This royalist outing, it appears. j
aroused the jealousy of the other par
ties and M. Buffet wired to the Duke
of Orleans that he feared the Bonapart- i
ists were also contemplating action.
The indictment proceeded with a re
capitulation of the Royalist maneuvers,
and declared the Royalists led and paid
a mob to insult President Louhet on
the day of his election.
Letters seized at the residence of M.
Ohevilly showed that the funds were
becoming exhausted by February. 1899,
and promises of money, mostly for
ladies, was found in the correspond
ence.
The culminary event of the Royalist
conspiracy was reached February 23, ;
when M. Deroulede made his notorious
attempt on the Place de la Nation to
Induce a brigade of infantry to march
on the Elysee Palace. Everything, it
seems, was prepared to carry out the !
Royalist plan that day, but M. Derou
lede's failure spoiled all. and the Duke
of Orleans, who was awaiting at Brus
sels the signal to come to Paris, re
ceived instead a telegram from M.
Buffet, saying: "Useless to come. Send
you further news to-morrow."
The Duke of Orleans then wanted to
go farther away, and the fact that the
Royalists wished to carry out their con
spiracy if possible was shown in a tele
gram which M. Buffet sent him. bee
ging him to remain, "as the Govern
ment did not know what to do with M.
Deroulede."
Continuing, the indictment then ex
plained the conspiracy was not aban
boned with the failure of February 23,
but that the machinations continued in
secret, and public meetings were con
tinually held. MM. Deroulede and
Marcel-Habert in July at St. Cloud and
in the Theater de la Republique. Paris,
outlined the plans still existing for the
overthrow of the parliamentary regime
by a mob uprising, aided by several
chiefs of the army and troops on whom
they could count.
The indictment evoked frequent out
bursts of derisive laughter and ironical
comment at the expense of the Royal
ists, especially on the reading of the
various telegrams exchanged and the
failure of the plots.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the indictment M. Bernard and his col
league's left the Senate, and M. Fal
lleres ordered the Senators to sit behind
closed doors.
In secret session the Senators dis
cussed whether they were competent to
sit as a high court and try the case.
On the resumption of the public sit
ting M. Fallieres announced that the
Senate had decided by a vote of 234
against 32 to allow the prisoner to be
represented by counsel during the pre
liminary Inquiry, but that the question
of the competence of the Senate to sit
as a high court to try the charges had
been adjourned until after the conclu
sion of the preliminary inquiry.
This is tantamount to the adjourn
men of the high court for several
weeks at least. Most of the Senators
were present when the announcement
was made, but there were few persons
in the public and press galleries.
The general comment in the Senate
lobbies was that the indictment dis
played the ridiculous but still criminal
character of the royalist intrigues to
overthrow the republic.

PRESENTS THE CLAIM
OF GREAT BRITAIN
Sir Richard Webster, Attorney Gen
eral, Argues Upon the Venezue
lan Boundary Matter.
PARIS. Sept. IS.â At to-day's session of
Ihe Anglo-Venezuelan Boundary Arbitra
tion Commission Sir Richard Wester, the
British Attorney General, continuing his
argument on behalf of Great Britain,
dwelt upon the alliance between the
Dutch and the Indians. Describing the
colony as it was in 1714, at the time of
the treaty of Utrecht, he claimed that
the Dutch then owned all that is now
contended for by Great Britain, and ar
gued that the acts of Spanish interfer
ence during the, eighteenth century had
been without effect.;
Describing the colony in 1814. he as
serted that at "he time of the transfer
to England all the territory and all the
rivers owned by the Dutch passed from
the Netherlands to England.
Sir Richard criticized the report of M.
Mallet-PrevoÃt, secretary of the commis
sion and one of the counsel for Vene
zuela, upon the maps that have been laid
before the tribunal, and then commenced
to sketch the British period of occupa
tion. He will conclude his argument to
morrow.

PROTEST AGAINST THE
ASSIGNMENT OF SCHLEY
WASHINGTON. Sept. 18. â Governor
Lowndes, Senator Wellington, Mayor Mal
ster of Baltimore and General Felix Ag
nus called upon the President to-day and
formally protested against the assignment
of Rear Admiral Schley to command the
South Atlantic squadron, on the ground
that it was not commensurate with the
dignity and the service he had rendered
during the Spanls.. -American war. The
protest was made voluntarily and without
Admiral Schley"s knowledge. The Presi
dent listened attentively to what the
Maryland Republican leaders had to say
but gave no indication of what he would
do.

This morning I had a conversation with
President Dole and ex-Attorney General
W. O. Smith in reference to the Hawaiian
Government being represented in Wash
ington during the next session of Con?
gress. The matter has been under dis
cussion in the local press and has stirred
up rather bitter partisan feelings between
the conservatives and the radicals, and I
felt that the Government's views should
be presented.
Mr. Dole stated that a commissioner
would certainly be appointed, to leave in
November, to represent Hawaii not in a
spirit of dictating or lobbying for certain
views or interests but to be on hand to
supply information when needed for com
mittees or individual legislators. Unless
such information was on hand grave in
justice and much future embarrassment
i nd difficulty might be caused by preju
dicial legislation, however honest in in
tent. To entirely and radically change
existing conditions would be Impractica
ble. They would have to be very care
fully considered.
So far as the labor problem was con
cerned, that might be deemed practically
settled by the abolition of the penal 'con
tract system, which was irretrievably
doomed. The only problem, remaining to
be solved is how and whence to obtain
the .labor most adaptable to the needs of
the country and most beneficial to Its
future. This seemed very likely to be
favorably solved by the efforts to be made
In Portugal and Italy, either by a simple
contract or free labor, but that was more
the province of the planters than of the
Government. The Government had un
reservedly selected W. O. Smith as Its
representative to Washington, as. being
Hawaiian born, a lawyer and ex-member
of the Cabinet, he. is thoroughly Informed
of the needs and existing conditions and
laws of the country. Mr. Smith had very
reluctantly accepted, but in the event of
his being unable to go the Cabinet had
another gentleman in view, but his name
could not. until Mr. Smith's final decision
had been received, be disclosed
Mr. Smith said that he did not wish to
go to Washington partly on account of
business relations, but more especially for
personal and family reasons, which might
eventually prevent him from accepting
the position. The matter was still under
consideration by him.
The Planters' Association will also, it
is understood, send a representative, but
Mr. Klnney is undecided whether his
services can be made available owing to
other business engagements.
There is another very interesting light
in connection with the labor problem
coming up before the courts. The attor
ney for the Hilo settlers has taken up the
case of certain Japanese at Pepeekeo
plantation, who were arrested fur breach
of their penal contracts and subsequently
released. A suit for $100,000 for false im
prisonment is to he brought. As a rule,
such cases have failed in this country, but
this case will be fought to the bitter end.
as a test case against the plantations and
on principle. Should a satisfactory prece
dent be established such suits will become
innumerable and costly and the country
will have more unrest.
As an interesting sequel to the release
of the Galicians. most of whom have ob
tained employment, the Sunday Volcano
has suspended, or as its editor says, "it
has been suppressed." Yesterday a
"dodger" was Issued in lieu of the paper
in which Mr. Marshall says:
"After printing six pages our publishers
declined to proceed further with this issue
and we were compelled to adopt this
method of keeping faith with our readers.
The Volcano, greater and more aggressive
than ever. will, like the phenfx, arise
from her ashes and soar into the literary
and emancipating skies of freedom. The
paper, the Sunday Volcano, asks no quar
ter in this warfare, neither will it give
any. Look out for its Hppearance, which
will come, like, the angels to the shepherds
on the plains of Bethlehem, proclaiming
a new dispensation :to the liberty-loving

DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 18.â Hard,
persistent rain has been the predomi

STOCKTON, Sept. 18.â The county fair
- . I pÂ» â  : 1 1 â¢ 1 Ed-day under promising auspices,
and the city presents a scene of old-time
fair-week activity. The fair will undoubt
edly surpass any of recent years, both as
to the attractiveness of the programme
and the attendance.
The pavilion in which so many famous
exhibits have been made was becoming
dilapidated for want of attention, when
six months ago five enterprising young
men, w. c. Neumiller, H. E. Adams, John
Willy. ('. K. Doan and George Catts took
the matter up and painted and renovated
the big structure till it presents a credit
able appearance.
Every foot of space has been sold for
some time, and at the formal opening to
night nearly all of the displays were in
position.
The show Is very complete and covers
almost every avenue of industry. The
place is profusely decorated, the national
colors predominating. The farmers are
t.ikinn an active interest and are well
n presi ntftd in the crowds that throng the
streets. Kakers have pitched tents around
the town, and will not be molested so long
as they do not attempt unlawful games.
IS INVESTIGATING
THE TIMBER FRAUDS
Walace R. Boss of the Forestry De
partment Tells How the Govern
ment Was Mulcted.
TACOMA, Sept. IS.â Wallace R. Ross of
th<- Forestry Department at Washington
is one of the several officers sent to ln
vestlgate the Umber frauds whereby large
tracts of timber in the forest reserves
have bees cut down. Mr. Ross says:
"Prior to the establishment of reserves
many thousands of acres of valuable tim
ber lands were patented by logging and
lumber companies. To such as held deeds
the Government offered to give an equal
acreage of timber lands at other points,
but neglected to set a date of exchange.
"These great companies at once put to
work an extra force of men and by keep
ing them hard at work soon had their
patent cleared of all timber; then under
the law they presented the land to the
Government, selecting in return the most
valuable timber land that could be se
cured. In other words, they have been
â double shooting the turn,' and in many
cases where it was the intention of the
Government to preserve a timbered area
it has on its hands nothing but a stump
acreage wholly devoid of material for
parks.
"When logging was done prior to the
passage of ihe law there was. of course,
no criminal intent; but the question the
department will now take up ia whether
or hot thflse who have cut timber from
their patents aftÂ«-r the passage of the law
can or cannot be held liable.
"It is not the purpose of the department
to prosecute those who have literally dis
obeyed the law. but to effectually put a
stop to future operations along the same
lines.
"As it is. the forept reserves in West
ern Washington are badly broken up and
it will take years before they will he as
good as those in the eastern part of the
State, which were not so heavily patented
when the law was passed."

: accumulate money, nor has intentional ex
, travagance been indulged in. Still, as a
! rule, our expenditures exceed our rev
: enues and a continuance of such a condl
i tion can have but one result. 1 do not
believe that biennial sessions of the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge or a lixed place of
) meeting will solve the problem. The
1 seeming remedy is a reduction in the sum
paid for mileage."
The grand sire gave an epitome history
! of the order and its growth, referring to
j the relation existing between the Ameri
can order and those of foreign countries.
! He reported that the affairs of the di
versely situated and widely separated
brotherhood were generally In a pros
perous Condition. Appended to the report
were reports on the condition of the order
in Europe, Japan, Hawaii, tlouth America,
Alaska and Northwest Canada.
Clrand Secretary Grant's was a very
voluminous report, The secretary re
ported encouraging-increases for the year
jin both the subordinate and Rebekah
branches, that of the former having been
greater than in any year since 1892. A
small decrease was reported iii the en
! campment branch, much smaller, how
ever, than in any other of several years
] past.
"Another evidence of progress during
i the yeur." said the secretary, "is found
in the unusually long list of warrants
issued. In Hawaii. Newfoundland. The
Netherlands and Alaska new charters
: have been asked for. Favorable reports
j are coming in from Cuba and a new lodge |
is to be instituted in Buenos Ayres. The
! number of foreign Grand Lodge represen
tatives Is increased to 189."
The secretary gave the following sum
mary of the condition of the order on De
i cember 31, LSyS:
Sovereign grand lodge, 1; independent
j grand lodges, 5 (Australia, Denmark,
I Germany, Sweden and Switzerland i; suli
| ordinate grand lodges, 65: subordinate
grand encampments, 65; subordinate i
lodges, 11,796; subordinate encampments, i
2641; lodge members. K59.929; encampment 1
members, 128.267; Rebekah lodges, ."iv>7 l : â¢
members of Rebekah lodges, 313.1G3.
The whole increase in all branches of
the order for the year was 30J>25. The
report showed the relief expenditures by
lodges to be 53, 126,050; relief by encamp- j
ments, $249.75G, and by Rebekah lodges, '
$47,149, making a total of $3 .422.086. The
total expenses of subordinate lodges fig
ures $4,159,726. The revenue of subordinate
lodges amounted to $7,752,282: subordinate
encampments, $."70,762: Rebekah Jodges,
$44:U45; total, $8,786,393. The toal invested
] funds aggregate $27,185,241.
Many resolutions were offered. The
most important one was introduced by
Representative Young of Maryland, and is
aimed at the mileage paid representatives j
to the Sovereign Grand Lodge. At present '
10 cents per mile is allowed for delegates
living east of the Rocky Mountains and ]2 \
cents west. Jt orders the figures reduced
to 8 and 10 cents, respectively.
A resolution is pending from last year"s
meeting reducing the mileage to 7 "and 8
cents. Both thtse were, after an hour's ;
discussion, referred to a special commit
tee of five, with a request to report as
soon as possible.
That the mi Wage allowance will he re
duced is believed t<> be certain, as a cut
musl be made in the expenses, and the
delegates are almost a unit in favoring
this as the proper place.
A resolution ordering the abolishing of
"visitiiiK cards" was referred to the reso- j
lutions committee. The visiting card is j
now necessary to enable a member of one j
lodge to visit another. It is proposed
inst-ad. to make the receipt for dues'
sufficient.
The matter of admitting negroes to the
Independent Order of odd Fellows :s ex
pected tn come up at this session as it
ha? done for a number of years. Resolu
tions providing for the admission of ne
groes have always heretofore been voted
down, and the sentiment among the pres
ent delegates causes predictions of a sim
ilar fate for any Introduction at this ses
sion. The X ii.k.ih branch is working to
obtain Representation on the floor of the
Soverefgn Grand Lodge, but then- is a
deaj of opposition to such an innovation
i and experimental stations. Professor \

SECURING THE
DESIRELLO JURY
Work Is Proceeding Very
Slowly.
ELEVEN WHO MAY SERVE
SPECIAL VENTRE OF TWENTY
FIVE EXHAUSTED.
Secon^^ia^^h^la^Wh^Cilled
Young James Johnston at Colma
in March of Last
Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 18.â The selec
tion of a jury for the second tri.;i of
Fred Desirello. the Baden Constable
charged with the murder of young James
Johnston, commenced at this place this
morning. The regular panel of fifty tales
man was exhausted before noon and a
special venire of twenty-five was ordered
returnable at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
This lias also been exhausted and fif
teen more ordered for to-morrow morn
ing. There are now eleven men in the
jury box, though none have as yet been
accepted. The probabilities are that all
day to-morrow will be consumed in se
curing; the jury.
So far the prosecution has exercised but
one peremptory challenge, and the de
fense eleven. Desirello has been once
tried for the crime of murder, the jury ;
standinÃ six for manslaughter and six for ;
acquittal. It is conceded by the prose
cution that a conviction of murder can- |
not be obtained, as there ure not the ele- |
ments in the case that go to make a )
crime of that character. The whole week |
will wry likely be consumed in the trial |
of the case, as there are a great many >
witnesses to be examined.
Desirello is charged with murdering i
James Johnston, a young man about 17 i
years of age, at (Mima on the 18th of last J
March. The evidence showed on the for- I
mer trial that on that day defendant had j
been In attendance at the coursing park
at Colma. being hired by the manage- i
ment of the association to maintain or
der and keep the peace. After the races
and on his way to Belli's store in the
town he stopped at the White House.
While he was standing in front of this
place talking with a friend young John,
ston, accompanied by John Vaccari and
Henry Jensen, two boys about his own
age, came down the road from the direc
tion of San Francisco in a wagon.
As to what occurred when the wagon
reached the White House, the evidence
is. contradictory. Defendant claims that j
the boys were either driving in a reck
less and careless manner and at a rate ,
of speed sufficient to endanK t- r their own
lives and the lives of pedestrians and
others who might be in the road, or that j
the horses had got beyond their control !
and were running away. He claims that \
he called to the boys to halt and slacken i
their slued, and when they paid no at
tention to him tired his pistol In the air !
to compel compliance. He tired a second j
and third shot, as he claims, at the j
horses, his only intention being to crip
ple or kill them, as he had cume to the ;
conclusion that they were running away. !
Instead of striking the horses, one of the !
shots struck young Johnston in the neck, i
causing his death a few minutes later.
The boys on the wagon claim that the
horses were at all times under the con
trol of the driver. John Vaccari, and that I
they wÂ»-re trotting only at an ordinary '
rate; that the first they knew of any at
tempt to stop them was when young:
Johnston was shot: that Desirello never;
called to them at all. Defendant in the j
tirH! trial admitted the killing, but ;
claimed that it was an accident pure and
simple, and six of the jurors believed
him not guilty.
Since his first trial Desirello has been
out of jail on bail and working at Baden, j
Defendant's counsel are ex-Judge E. F. j
Fitzpatrick and ex-District Attorney H.
W. Walker. District Attorney Bullock is
prosecuting;

THREE MEN INJLRED
f Perry M.il and Lumber
] , LosAx_- !:ngCa. and
J. F. Holbrook Destroyed.
Scecial Dispatch to Tie Call.
LOS ANGELES. Sept. IS.â Practically
an entire block bounded by Commer
cial, Alameda, Requena and Wilming
ton streets -was destroyed by fire this
afternoon. The buildings destroyed
"Were those of the Los Angeles Farm-
Ing- and Milling Company, the Perry
Mill and Lumber Company, the plant
cf J. F. Holbrook, dealer in iron pipe
and oil well casings, in addition to a
large amount of lumber belonging- to
the two lumber fines.
Three men were Injured In the fire,
two of them probably fatally. They
are:
GEORGE KNOWLTON. assistant en
gineer; fatally burned.
JAMSS M. DIETER, engineer; seri-
H. B. TEBBETTS, overcome by the
heat.
Th-e fire originated In the engine- ;
room of the Perry Mill and Lumber i
Company. A spark from the engine i
Jell into a pile of shavings and in a j
few minutes the whole place was In a
blaze. In a struggle to put out the I
Carries Knowlton and Dieter received '
their injuries.
â As soon as possible an alarm of fire I
vas turned in and this was closely fol- j
lowed by a second alarm. By the time |
the engines reached the scene of the !
conflagration the big- three-story brick !
building and the whole yard a:. . the !
mill of the Perry Company were ablaze.
Next to the Perry Mill on the east 'â 
â¢"were the frame buildings of the Los I
Angeles Farming and Milling Company. !
These and the big one-story building |
that runs along Alameda. street were j
soon a roaring furnace. The firemen !
had an almost impossible task in fight- J
frig- the Harries on account of the In- â¢
tense heat. Even the police had easy i
â work in keeping- back the crowd, as i
the heat did their work for them.
The tire department realized that it
could not hope to save the buildings
already on fire and therefore directed
nearly all of its energies to keep the <
buiMlngs across the street from de- I
struction. The small shops along Com
mercial street smoked from the heat I
and many of the occupants were in
fear that the hungry flames would drive
them from their homes and business.
The hose was 'kept playing on these
buildings and they were saved.
After the walls of the warehouse at |
Alameda and Commercial streets had '
fallen the troughs leading from the
bins In the upper part of the Farming
and Milling Company's warehouse were i
eaten open by the fire and a stream
of wheat ten feet in diameter poured
davzn en the fire below. This served
ttf smother cne of the tottest parts of. j
the blaze.
At 2 o'clock the fire was under con
trol, though the lumber and the milling
companies plants were swept clear,
with the exception of one warehouse
on Alameda street.
Though of very short duration the !
fire was one of the most destructive
that ever occurred in Los Angeles, at
least a quarter of a million dollars go-
Ing up in smoke in less than an hour.
the Los Angeles Farming and Milling
Company had a stock on hand valued, j
â¢with the expensive machinery, at $120.
--000, which Is practically a total loss.
An insurance of nearly $100,000 was car
ried.
The Perry Lumber and Milliner Com
pany carried a stock valued at $125,000,
including a large number of valuable
patterns, which it will be difficult to
replace. This company only carried
115.000 insurance. There are a number j
of small individual losses which foot up
In the aggregate the amount named.
During the progress of the fire a man,
three women and a boy were standing
on a porch in the rear of Emil Faure'a
saloon when the floor gave way and all
were precipitated a distance of twenty
feet to the ground. The three women
were injured, but none, it Is believed, I
James Dieter, engineer of the Perry j
Mining â â â¢.---_-â :-; !
ton, his assistant, were both horribly '
burned in the fire. The chances for
Knowlton's recovery are very slight
end Dieter's condition is scarcely less
serious.
â Ward Cunningham, foreman of the
Perry Mill and Lumber Company, is miss
ing, and his family and friends fÂ»ar that
he perished fn the flames. They have been
searching for him all the afternoon and
evening, but not the slightest trace of
him has been found.
NO OFFICIAL REPORT
OF THE BOMBARDMENT
WASHINGTON*. Sept. IS.â Admiral Wat-
JB<m has not yet reported to the Navy De
partment upon the reported bombardment
of the fort In Subig Bay by the Charles
ton yesterday. General Otis recently was
Informed by cable that he could have th*
fullest co-operation of the navy in any
movement, and it is thought at the Navy
Department that in execution of thi3
promise Admiral Watson is initiating' th*
ne-w campaign. '
Subiz Bay is the site of a projected
r.aval station. The Spaniards discovered
that it afforded advantages for such a
r,urpo<e over Manila Bay, and especially
over Cavite. They spent nearly $1,000,000
upon the place before the war and it was
one of the plans of Admiral Montejo, the
Spanish naval commander, to make his
stead against Dewey at Subig- instead of
at Cavite. â â

KELLER ADMITS

Did Not Know the Posi

Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKER3FTELD. Sept. IS.â The Famoso
wreck continues to be the topic of con
versation, and the majority of the- people
believe that the Porterville crew was re
sponsible for the awful happening- This
Is the opinion of such railroad men as
venture to give an opinion.
Station Agent T. A. Keller at Famoso
sticks to the story that he told Conductor
Kessler of the Porterville .train that No.
S had orders to wait at Famoso for the
*xtra freight. He said he heard the order
going over the wires from Kern, but had
given Kessler no written orders.
"When you dropped the semaphore and
showed a clear track did you know that
Kessler'3 train was on the main line?"
"Why. certainly not; I thought the main
line clear when I dropped it," was the
reply. "Further I did not know that
Kessler was going to take the time of No.
S when I told him it was going to wait
for a freight." Agent Keller did not know
whether the order he heard for No. â¢ to
stop at Famoso had ever been counter -
manded or not.
A gentleman with a very good knowl
edge of Southern Pacific ways said to
day he did not think that any. one would
be discharged by the railroad on account
of the wreck, as at the damage suit
likely to follow the men may tell some
thing the company did not want known.
He intimated that an attempt may be
made to saddle the blame of the wreck
on dead Engineer" Wright. The com
munity is greatly dissatisfied over the
wav the coroner's inquest turned out. It
wanted more facts brought out.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBEE 19, 1899.
RODDEN'S ACTION
IS DENOUNCED
Citizens Disgusted With
the Judge.
EcÂ«sclai Dispatch to The CalL
SAN RAFAEL. Sept. 18.â The Call's ex
pose of Judge Rodden's bold attempt to
throttle justice and determine the guilt
of a defendant who had not even been
heard in court was a shock to the law
respecting and liberty-loving' people of
this community. San Rafael was astound
ed a: the revelations, and solid citizens
expressed shame that they had voted
such a man as Redden into the respons
ible position of Justice of the Peace.
The town with one voice has denounced
his action in the Perkins case. They char
acterize it as a high-handed outrage such
as no law-abiding community can afford
to tolerate. A repetition of his offense
againsr decency and Justice would go
hard with Rodden while his fellow towns
men are in their present frame of mind.
The city which has been his home for thÂ«
past twenty-two years is not proud of
him now. His neighbors have no kind
words to say for him in the hour when
his shame has brought a reflection on the
courts of Mails County. No excuses are
offered for him; none can be. His offense
is not a trilling- matter, and the proof of
his guilt is too positive to be contro
verted.
Within a few minutes after the arrival
of the train which brought the morning
papers the news of The Call's expose was
on every lip. Copies .of the paper were
sought with eagerness, and every word
or: the arraignment of Rodden was read
with breathless interest. The citizens
were not long in appreciating the enor
mity of -â¢-- The proof was there,
and neither Et dden nor a possible friend
made any attempt to deny it-
Excitement ran high. On every street
comer, in the stores and other public
places men congregated and discussed the
raw work of Rodden. They had heard ru
mors of such things before, but never
had the proof been presented until The
Call laid bare tne rottenness of the Rod
den court.
The disgraced Judge, after reading of
his own shame, presented a spectacle that
in any other Instance would have excited
the compassion of men whose heart 3
might have been made of mud. He ran up
and down the streets like a madman,
searching in vain for a friend who might
offer him condolence. His acquaintances
took him to task for his actions, and no
where could he find a place of refuge
from the scorn of his fellow citizens. The
expose will have the effect of remedying
an evil in the machinery of the Just
Court of San Rafael, for the people will
see to it in the future that Â«very defend
ant will be given a hearing before judg
ment is passed upon him. and that the
Judge will not be allowed to use his
power to punish his real or fancied ene
mies.
Despite the fact that Rodden has held
Perkins to answer to a charge of criminal
libel the preliminary hearing will not take
place until next Friday morning, and then
it will not be In the court presided over
by the biased and vindictive magistrate.

were In session ail day. The nearest ap
proach to friction came In the executive
committee, when George Fred Williams
was asked why the Massachusetts Demo
crats were to select delegates to the Dem
ocratic National Convention next Thurs
day, months before the national conven
tion was called. It is said that Mr. Wil
son admitted that John R. McLean had
some ground for charging that the Massa
chusetts Democrats had taken "snap
judgment," but -insisted that the Bryan
Democrats feared that the anti-Bryan
men might get the delegation away from
them if the election of national delegates
was put oft until next year.
Mr. Williams.- just before leaving for
home, said that the Republicans had
passed a law which provided that only
two political conventions should be held
in any one year by any one party, and If a
convention were held next year to elect
national delegates the Democrats would
not be able to hold the other two neces
sary nominating conventions.

MANILA, Sept. IS. â Colonel Den by
and Dean Worcester of the Philippine
Commission sailed for home to-day. All
the attaches of the commission remain

been continuing to assist the milltary

the work of collecting material con
cerning the resources of the islands,
their government by the Spanish, and
whatever other points are likely to be

permanent form of administration.
The commission has the views of many
prominent Filipinos and is prepared to
submit an exhaustive report to Con
gress.

CHINA PROTESTS AGAINST
OTIS' EXCLUSION ORDER
WASHINGTON. Sept. IS.â The imperial
Chinese Government, through Its Minister
here, Wu Ting Fang, has lodged with the
State Department an emphatic protest
against the military order of General Otis
excluding Chinese from the Philippines.
Neither the State Department nor the
Chinese legation will give any informa
tion concerning the protest, but from en
tirely reliable quarters It Is learned that It
insists that General Otis' action is con
trary to international law. In violation of
existing treaties and in complete disre
gard oi the friendly relations which have
been so long maintained between the two
countries. Minister Wu called ... State
Department last Friday and it is be
lieved he submitted the protest in per
son at that time.
The matter was promptly brought to the
attention of the President, as the protest
was of such a character as to give the
subject an international aspect consider
ably beyond the purely military questions
involved. It is raid that China points out
that she has welcomed the recent advent
of th- United States into the affairs of
the far East, and has hoped that this step
would prove a further bond and would
extend the relations between the two
countries, particularly in their neighbor-
In? possessions. Furthermore. It Is under
stood that among the specific points of
protest submitted by the Chinese Govern
ment is one to the effect that such an
order is a departure from the announced
purpose of the President of the United
States to maintain the present status of
affairs in the Philippines until Congress
has determined a permanent condition.
The military phases of the question have
been referred to Secretary Root. Owing
to his familiarity with International law
he probably will consider the subject
broadly, both in its international a3 well
as its military aspects.
General Otis' order was issued some
time ago, without direction from Wash
ington, and apparently as a military ne
cessity, although the Chinese protest
ursres that there is no such military
necessity, but, on the contrary, that the
Chinese have rendered valuable military
assistance.
Genera] Otis' order is signed by himself
as military- governor of the Philippines
and by "Brigadier General Charles A.
Whittaker as Collector of Customs, hav
ing supervision of Chinese affairs. It
says: "The laws of the United States
which prohibit the entrance of Chinese
will be enforced here."
The decree then except! such Chinese
as have previously lived in the Philip
pines and who hold certificates showing
this fact. It also except? Chinese of
ficials, travelers, etc., excepted under the
treaty between the United States and
China. Provision is made for registering
the Chinese in the Philippines and their
deportation to China in case of failure to
refrister. As very few Chinese other than
those now in the Philippines come within
the exception, the effect of the decree is
to make the exclusion practically abso
lute.

BRITISH SHIPS CHASED
BY AMERICAN GUNBOATS
HONGKONG, Sept. IS.â The American
grunboat Pampanga has chased the Brit
ish steamer Yuen Sang from Manila to
Hongkong. The g-unboat sighted the
steamer during the night of September 13
about thirty miles off the north coast of
the island of Luzon, and suspected that
she was a filibuster. The Pampanga
fired threo shots, which the Yuen Sang
disregarded, until the third shell exploded
near her. She then stopped, and the com
mander of the gunboat boarded the Yuen
San?, found he had make a mistake and
apologized.
An American gunboat, name unknown,

NOVEL PLANS FOR
NEW BATTLESHIPS
Vessels Designed to Have Speed
as Well as Great Figbting
Ability.
> WASHINGTON, Sept. IS.â The naval engineers have projected plans
Â» for the new battleships which, if adopted, will provide an entirely novel
I type of the navy. The purpose is to have these ships combine in them
selves the good qualities of battleship and armored cruiser. The aim
will be to have the highest possible speed for such ships, in this case
1 twenty knots per hour. This will be attained by the use of triple screws,
' two small side screws for use in ordinary cruising- and a big central
1 screw to add to the propulsive force in case high speed is needed. The
i ships would be of 14.000 or 15,000 tons displacement and with seven
i inches of the latest armor would be almost as strong in defense as a
! regular battleship. The coal capacity would be about 2000 tons â sufficient
at ordinary cruising speed to carry the ship ten or fifteen thousand miles.
bound from Manila to Hongkong. Tae
warship sighted the steamer near Snbig
Bay during the night of September lt> and
whistled signals to stop. The signals
were disregarded, and the gunboat ran
alongside the Diamte, getting so dGse
that her guns tore away the Diamte's out
raging. Her passengers were thrown into
a panic. The "gunboat, on learning vie
identity of the steamer, shored off.
CONTINUED RAINS
BLOCK OTIS' PLANS
' -WASHINGTON, Sept. IS.â According to
official advices received at the War De
partment to-day. General Otis has been
disappointed In carrying out several mili
tary movements contemplated at this
time by reason of continued rains. He
fears now that the American troops will
be able to do little if anything in the way
of aggressive action before the 1st of No
vember. The authorities had hoped to
get news of several important engage
ments, the plans of which they have
known for some time, during the present
month. In some respects they consider
that delay will be beneficial. By the 1st
of November General Otis will have 10.000
more men than he has at the present time
and will therefore be able to put a larger
army in the field and. begin a much more
aggressive campaign than is possible at
the present time.

ORPHAN CLAIMS
WERE DUPLICATED
West Oakland Home
Charged With Fraud.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. IS.â The claims
against the State for the support of or
phans and abandoned children sent In fay
the West Oakland Home for the six
months ending Jane 30. 1399, have not yet
been approved by the State Board of Ex
aminers, and there is no reason to expect
that they will be In the near future.
Since the receipt of the claims the ex
perts of the State Board have been busy :
on them, and according to their figures
the West Oakland Home for the half year
ending December 31. ÃBS, drew from the
State H')77 â¢' for support of orphans-, etc..
who were not then in the institution and j
some of whom had been discharged two |
years before, and .whose names, after
being dropped from the rolls for a period
of six months, were again entered and
funds collected on the entries. These
figures show that from July 1. HM to |
December 31, 1898, the Oakland institu- j
tion has collected altogether 51341 27 for
children who had been discharged and for '
the support of whom the institution was in I
no wise interested.
The figures in the office of the State
Board of Examiners also show that for
the half year ending June 30, 1899 claims '
aggregating $1143 37 were sent in by the '
West Oakland Home for the support of !
children previously discharged from the i
institution.
Th- figures show that there were thirty
two allesred fraudulent entries made, on
the majority of which the State for the
half year ending December 31. IS3B, paid ;
the usual quota, and they further show
that those entries, with two exceptions,
were duplicated and sent in as valid
claims against the State for the six'
months ending June 30, 1899.
Several inquiries have been made as to
the reason of the delay in approving the I
claims and the reply written to-day con- I
tamed a request to the institution to re- |
turn to the State the sum of $1341 27 which
it had wrongfully received.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 18.â The weather
favored the Shamrock to-day In her first
trial over the full international course of
thirty miles. Bright sunshine, clear air
and a splendid Failing: ln\-zi' offered an

Fifteen miles to windward wis marked

south breeze blowing about eight knots
an hour, but the wind grew until, on the
homeward leg, It was blowing fully four

On the windward leg I hours 15 minutes

could have been made In somewhat less

the yacht than was actually necessary.

The mainsail, which seemed faultless on
Friday, was somewhat rough on foot, but
during the day the wind smoothed out its

decided, after much discussion, to hold
the twenty-mile team race on October 8
and the ten-mile handicap on the 15th
The date for the fifty-mile track race was
not set positively, as Delegate Lamkln
from San Jose offered a proposition' that
the race be held in that city instead of
here, and held out such Inducements that
the directors decided to withhold final
action until their next meeting.
Robert M. Welch made an impassioned
speech in favor of the association turn
ing over its race control to the National
Cycling Association and devoting Its en
ergies to road Improvement and similar
pastoral pursuits. Charles Albert Adams
opposed this plan, stating that now that
the association had achieved its ends in
securing control of the sport on this
coast it should continue its management.
The matter was finally left open for the
delegates to ruminate about until the next
meeting.
The delegates present were: Paul M.
Nippert, Robert M. Welch, Charles Albert
Adams, Stanley G. Scovern, T. G. Spil

BESTS "COFFEE
COOLER" CRAIG
Syracuse Lad Gives the Ne
gro a Terrible Drubbing
in the Ring.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. Tommy Ryan,
the Syracuse middle-weight pugilist, grave \
Frank Craig, the Harlem "Coffee Cooler,"
a terrible drubbing before 7000 persons at
the Coney Island Sporting Club to-night.
Craig only recently returned from Eng
land, where he has been making quite a
reputation and plenty of money tor some
three years past.
Craig was introduced as Frank Craig of
England, and this announcement proved
some merriment, and a good deal of hiss-
Ing.
Both men were in splendid condition,
and each when he weighed In two hours
before the tight was under 158 pounds.
That Ryan would defeat Craig was gen
erally believed, but from tnÂ«- glowing ac
counts of Craig's doings among the
Britons every one looked tor a much bet
ter, light thai, that which the colored man
put up. He knocked Ryan down in the
second round, but never afterward aid he
hold the upper hand.
Ryan's fast work in the fourth round
told on Craig, and two heavy rights over
the art at tin opening of the filth round
did not improve his condition. Ryan's
left played a tattoo on Craig's face, and
the colored man began spitting blood.
In the sixth Ryan sent his right under
the jaw and uppercut his opponent with
his left on the lace. This brought more
blood from Craig's mouth and two more
jabs made him wild. Puling the next two
rounds Ryan kept the negro busy trying
to protect himself.
Round 9â Ryan sent right and left three
times to the head. Then he sent Craig to
the floor with a right swing. Craig re
mained down about eight seconds and
then dropped three times on one knee to
escape punishment. Ryan finally got him
up and pummeled him with right and left.
Craig seemed to be quitting and dropped
twice more. Ryan and Craig fell and
Craig lay on top, hugging Ryan's body
with his arm until the referee got them
apart at the bell. Craig staggered about
blindly and Ryan awaited an opportunity
for a swine:.
Round Ryan lost no time in going
for his man. He rushed him and Bent
both hands to the head and body. Craig
landed two wild swings on Ryan's head
and shoulders, but Ryan kept punching
him all over the ring. Craig daggered
about blindly. Tommy landed a right on
the side of Craig's head, the "Cooler"
falling in a heap. He got up on the tenth
second and Ryan rushed at him again,
but Referee Siler set-ing that Craig was
unable to defend himself stepped between
the men and declared Ryan the winner.
Time of last round two minutes thirty sec
onds.

PARIS, Sept. 18.â Paris is again to see
a bull-fight. As a matter of fact, it will
not be tn the city, but on its doorstep,
that is to say, at Enghein. There a plaza
is to be built to accommodate 10.000 spec
tators The first "fiesta" is to take place
on October 1. Four espadan have been
engagedâ Minuto, Montcs and Ouerrento
(all Spaniards) rind Felix Robert, a
Frenchman and the only French matador,
in fact as he has received the accolade,
or what is its tauromaehic equivalent,
the "alternatlvo," in Madrid. This, in the
bull-fighting world, corresponds to an
Italian prlma donna's debut at the Scala
in Milan In the palmy days of Bellinlan
There is sure to be a howl about this
bull-fighting festival, but it is hard to see
h.>w the law is to stop it here, when it is
allowed every Sunday all over France.

BELIEVE IT A PIPE DREAM.
I Police Fail to Corroborate an Erratic
Evening Paper's Story.
An erratic evening paper published a
| story last evening to the effect that a
Miss S. W. Williams, supposed to reside
on Clay Btreet, near Hyde, had been
beaten and nearly murdered by a saldier.
The story told of two sisters who were
followed by a man in the army uniform
for several blocks, and then of a brutal
assault upon one. of them because she re
fused to place a small donation Into an
outstretched hand. According to the ac
count th<- abused young woman hastened
to the residence of Dr. It. C, Meyers, her
physician, who could n<u tell at the press
hour of the erratic journal whether or not
the injuri< s would prove serious.
Lieutenant of Police Esola of the Cali
fornia-street station made an investiga
tion of the affair and was unable to get
corroboration of the Btory. At police
headquarters the story is pronounced a
fake. l>r. Meyers could not be found las'
evening. His cleric, however, disclaims
any knowledge "f the alleged assault and
one of them on duty last night stated
that while he was at work Sunday even-
Ing no woman applied at the drugstore
nor physician's office for medical treat

OPENING OF
THE RACES
AT STOCKTON
Everything Favorable to Ex
cellent Sport and Three
Favorites First.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Sept. 18.â The opening day
of the racing under the auspices of the
Stockton Driving Club brought out what
was without doubt the largest initial day
crowd ever at the local park.
The betting was light and there Is every
indication that it will not improve in the
books.
The track ; was very fast and the
weather could not have been better for
the horses. Three favorites were first to
the wire, but only one of them was heav
ily played, and the books probably lost
more money on the victory of the sprin
ter New Moon in the seven furlong dash
than in the other two events. Daedalion
won the 2:30 pace off the reel, finishing
each heat under a strong pull, with
plenty to spare. Goldy, with Ed Lafferty
up' kept after the winner, but could not
force him to a break.
The betting on the first heat opened
with Daedalion a favorite at 10 to 1 for
the field, but before the horses were
given the word it was 10 to 10. The books
posted the following odds:
Daedalion 2 to .',. Gaff Topsail and Goldy
4 each and Clipper even money.
The exhibit! in the Agricultural Pa
vilion are all in place and never before in
the history of the building has there been
, such elaborate displays or so many of
them. A splendid programme has been
arranged for each evening. The racing
card at the track is a strong one of three
harness eventsâ the 2:12 trot, 2:15 pace and
a match race â in addition to two dashes,
a five-furlong and a seven-furlong. The

HIGH SCORES

SAN RAFAEL
Successful Close of Annual
Festival of the California
Schuetzen Club.
One of the most successful shooting fes
tivals that the California Schuetzen Club
has ever held was brought to a close
yesterday afternoon at Schuetzen Park.
In all the contests there was shown
marksmanship of an unusually high or
der. Strecker, the champion of so many
contests, fared badly. He won only the
goblet for the greatest number of points,
yet in every event he was so close to
the winner that he shared in the vic
tory.
The prize on' the honorary target was
won by D. 13. Faktor with a score of 74.
Strecker was next to him with >'â 'â . while
Rahwyler, danger and others reached as
high as 70. , ,ââ
The members' contest was won by Wil
liam Glindermann. He did not appear at
the ranges ' until late in the afternoon
and it was thought that Louis Bendel had
"a cinch" on the money. Glinderrnann
on his first ticket made 71. with 24 to
back it, defeating Bendel by a small mar
gin. The scores were as follows:

courage failed him. is at liberty. With
-ill the monstrous crimes the Chief of Po

crime being charged by U'ellx Bloc*, the
tailor who claimed that as the man Just
released had rested sufficient nerve
to don a suit of clothes sent him by the
cutter thereof he must certainly be a
crook of the deepest dye. A writ of habeas
c'.rnus sworn out on behali of the accused
permitted the hearing of the tacts of the
case however, and when they had been
presented together with the law bearing
' tV issues involved Judge Murasky,
who heard the argument on tne writ, held
that even sufficient evidence did not exist
for the successful prosecution of an ac
tion in trover, let alone upon which to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19. 1899.
DR. VOORSANGER
WARNS AGAINST
IMPERIALISM
Reviews the Dreyfus
Case.
THE LESSON IT CONTAINS
SAYS THE INCREASING ARMY IS
A MENACE.
During the services last night at Temple
Emanu-El in celebration of the feast of
Sukkoth, Rabbi Voorsanger lectured on
"The Dreyfus Case After the Second
Court-martial." So large an audience
gathered that the seating capacity of the
house of worship was entirely inadequate
to seat it, many remaining standing till
the conclusion. The music was particu
larly delightful.
In beginning his discourse Rabbi Voor-
j sanger called attention to the 9th of Sep
i tember, the day on which thi> court-mar
j tial at Rennea found Dreyfus guilty, <as
"tlir- day upon which human justice was
assassinated and the French nation sanc
tilied by crime."
"I can understand," he said, "at this
particular point In the worlcTs history
that there are some people who will ask
'Where Is God? 1
"1 do not want to present the Jewish
standpoint of this case," he continued, re
ferring to the Dreyfus court-martial. "At
some other time, when you feel like it, I
may open the books of Jewish history for
you and show you that the story of thin
man is but an added chapter of the his
tory of the martyr known to you as the
Wandering Jew; that it is but one of the
rehearsed stories which has escaped apol
ogists who write history â but to-night I
Intend to confine myself to a consideration
of this case from the standpoint of an or
dinary American citizen, to ascertain
whether or not it has merit.
"There are a good many people here
and elsewhere whose stupid prejudice,
whose unreasoning race hatred, whose
i fanaticism forever prevents them from
coming to a reasonable conclusion, but 1
dislike to argue with people who believe
that there is a Deity who turns an eye of
love to the Christian and an eye of hatred
to everybody else. I hold such sentiments
and teachings contemptible, and l would
not dignify them by denouncing them as
being unworthy of the lowest grade of
human intelligence. No! no! I will not
speak of Dreyfus as the Jew, but as a
man, a Frenchman and a citizen. What
has he to say for himself before the bar
of public opinion in America? Is he guilty
or not guilty?"
Rabbi Voorsanger briefly reviewed the
history of the first court-martial, the ac
tion taken five years later by the Court
of Cassation and the recent proceedings
of the military court at Rentes. Of the
case he paid:
Sometimes I think the whole affair ought
not to be taken seriously. Wasn't it a
beautiful arrangement. They had a tradi
tion In olden times Of the "Man with the
Iron Mask"; and they hail the prisoner of
the Chateau d'lf, and that story must be
reproduced for the entertainment of France.
The people of France needed another spasm
: and Devils Island was put on as the last
scene In the tragedy that was gotten up,
because, forsooth, the nation needed enter
tainment. Sometimes it appears so, â¢ and I
was afraid that; the whole affair must be
taken as humorous. It didn't appear that
Justice could fall so low.
Voicing his contempt for the military
judges of Dreyfus and- their partial ver
dict. Dr. Voorsangor said he did not be
lieve that the ends of Justice would :be
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
ECONOMY AND WRECKS
Kruttschnitt Blamed for the
Policy of Retrenchment,
Traffic Manager Stubbs Defends the Gen
eral Manager, and Says He Must Not Be
CensuredforTrainmen'sCarelessness.
THE recent frequency of wrecks on
the Southern Pacific Railroad has
attracted more than the ordinary
share of public attention. The
dozen that occurred on different
parts of the system during the first
six months of the year have been fol
lowed so closely by six or seven more
within the present month that people are
rapidly gaining the opinion that some
thing is radically wrong with the road.
and that the sooner it is traced and
r. medied the better. As it is now it ap
pears to be almost like taking one's life
in one's hand to make a journey over
any of the lines of the company. En
gines are smashed, cars ditched, lives
crushed out of the bodies of passengers
and train crews day after day. The com
pany and tho Coront-rs stationed at va
rious Doints on the system are appar
ently busy investigating, but up to date
seem no nearer to the seat of the danger
than when they started.
Various theories have, been advanced
to account for this succession of disas
ters, but no one theory by any possible
majiner of means will cover them all.
compassed by any unkind act or any re
taliatory method, but, he continued, tho
French people ought tn understand that
the source of American Indignation at the
Dreyfun verdict Bprings not from a desire
to meddle with other people's business
but from the Btrength of their own idt-ais
The people of the united States could not
understand any judge and jury holding
in contempt the opinion of the highest
court in the land, as the Dreyfus court
martial had held the opinion of the Court
of Cassation when militarism declared
Dreyfus a traitor to his country. HÂ»: con
tinued:
What do you think? Is hÂ« a traitor? I
have beard some voices raised here and
there thai say he is pruilty. Probably there
mv pome here as well. Who declares Drey
fus quiity? Political trait. irs; false priests;
; i iple who desire pews in churches as step
ping stones to anarchy; people who are
thriving upon sedition, upon raff- hatred
and Upon treason. They declare Dreyfus
guilty to-day. The civilized world has de
clared him Innocent.
Fellow citizens, we in the f'nited States
ought to â  learn something else fn.ni this
Dreyfus case. I am a Jew, a co-religionist
<.f Dreyfus, and I would rather stand with
him and suiter with him than to lie in the
place of his judges. We might to learn
something with which thf- Jew is not con
cerned and with which the Frenchman Is
not concerned. It seems to me that when
â  court of limited jurisdiction, as this court
martial was, can override the decrees Âf the
Supreme Court of the land, there must he
something rotten In Denmark. We cannot
permit any court to insult the dignity of
that court which represents the Inchest
authority of our constitution, in France
a court of soliders laughs at civil jurisdic
tion. Thai shows that. In reality there are
two factors In France, that Is the army
and the people; and. In the United States

manhood and the rights and privileges for
which your lathers fought go on Increasing
the standing army of the United States and
find out to ytmr cost what will occur when
a military oligarchy or a military conspiracy
will endeavor to override the will of the
people as It has dine in France.
That Is what Ih going to happen to us;
that will be the result of the growth of
standing armies all over the world. In
Germany and Russia, a standing army may
be a glorious thing from the point of the
feudalists, but from the standpoint of a
free man, a standing army Is a constant
menace to the free institutions which we
hope to defend with our lives.
I have refrained from talking politics
from this pulpit, hut the time has come
when the pulpit must tnke a hand when
men feel In their own minds that the rights
and privileges of the people are in Jeopardy
and with the possibility of an army seek
ing to impose upon the people, can take
place In this country as will as in France.
Let us not sacrifice our Ideals of democ
racy, or our Ideals of justice in this new
passion, in this new-grown love for im
perialism, in this new fad of the nation.
Let us take care not to sacrifice too much
of the simplicity of our lives, lest we fall
and sorrow as unhappy France Is sorrowing.
Spreading rails, negligent trainmen,
storms and In the last accident in Ala
meda fog have been blamed for the
wrecking of trains and the maiming of
travelers. None of the. heads of the com
pany â Rill make any statement that seems
to throw any light on the menacing state
of affairs. When they are assked concern
ing any or all of the accidents they an
swer that the company would prevent
them if it could; that it feels the loss <>f
its cars and its engines; that it dots not
like to be put to the expense of sending
wrecking trains and surgeons to the scene
of every accident, and that if there is
any possible way to avert the disasters
they would only be too glad to learn it
and to put it into practice immediately.
Then the officers ot the company allow
the impression to get out In some way or
another that the fault lies really with the
trainmen, who disobey orders. I ntortu
nateiy tor the trainmen, tney dare nut
tell. Should any one of them feel cour
ageous enough to deny the innuendoes of
the heads ot department he feels that he
would get his discharge in short order.
Consequently the men Keep mum and the
accidents go on happening with the regu
larity oi clockwork.
The public, which has long waited for
some explanation from the railroad peo
ple, has about finished building ut a
theory of its own to fit* the series of
accidents. As a basis it began with the
well-founded rumors that lloated up from
the souih shortly after the wreck of the
train bearing delegates to the National
Educational Association convention at
L,os Angeles. Two women were killed on
that train and any number of others
badly shaken up and bruised, escaping
death only by a miracle. It was said that
that wreck was caused from the fact that
the engineer of the teachers' special was
asleep at his post, absolutely unable to
hold up his head by reason of the fact
that he was overworked. Putting two
ami two togetherâ and tor this purpose
there are more than four accidentsâ the
people have come to the conclusion that
there is only one theory that will account
for the nearly a score of accidents that
have occurred along the line of the South
ern Pacilic during the present year. That
theory, which has attained the propor
tions ef an uncontradicted rumor, is be-
Ueved by a great number of people. It ia
that the policy of retrenchment inaug
urated by the Southern Pacilic Company
at the beginning of the year is responsi
ble for all the accidents, in that it com
pels engineers, firemen and trainmen to
work when they are nearly dropping on
their feet from sleep, while it has cut
down the force of trackwalkers to the
danger point.
This policy of retrenchment, rightly or
not, has been generally attributed to
Genera] Manager Kruttschnitt. A re
porter for The Call paid a visit yesterday
to his office for the purpose of interview
ing turn in regard to the recent criticisms
of the management growing out of the
frequency of wrecks on the system. The
general manager was very busy with his
correspondence and would not say till
to-day whether or not ho cared to give
out an interview. Traffic Manager Stubbs
was asked for an interview on the so
called Kruttschnitt policy of retrench
ment said to be responsible for the recent
accidents on the road and for the delays
in the overland train service. He gave
out the following:
"Mr. Kruttschnitt'a policy, whatever
it may be, good, bad or indifferent (and
I believe it to be good, for he is one of the
best transportation men in the country),
i< not responsible for the recent accidents
on our roads nor for delay to the over
land train service. The latter, I am in
formed, is largely due to failure of our
connections to make schedule time, which
is followed through to destination with
increasing loss of time, because the heavy
traffic of the Southern Pacific Company
precludes the possibility of its making up
the time lost by its connections, as has
been its custom under ordinary condi
tions.
"The disposition to mnke the general
manager responsible for the disobedience
or forgetfnlness or carelessness of train
men is unfair, is harmful to him person
ally and a positive injury to the public.
The press loses its force and diminishes
its power for good when it becomes per
sonal." ]2_
THE NEW COAST
AND GEODETIC
STEAMER HERE
Pathfinder Is in Port
From San Diego.
Tho United States roast and geodetic
survi y steamer Pathfinder arrived from
New York last Sunday night. She is a
brand new vessel, having been completed
during the Spanish war. She will go to
the navy yard and have a few small guns
put aboard, after which she will do some
important work for T'ncle Sam in the
neighborhood of Hawaii. After that she
will go to Alaskan waters. The Path
finder is a wonderfully economical boat,
as she can steam 250 knots on a con
sumption of ten tons of coal.
The Pathfinder left New York in June
last and went to Washington. D. C. From
there she went to Norfolk and some de
fects having been found in her she went
to Newport News for an overhauling.
She started on her long journey to San
Francisco on June 16, and stopped on the
way at San Lueie. Fernambuoo, Rio de
Janeiro, Montevideo, and then made her
way through the straits of Magellan to
Callao, and from there to San Diego and
thence to this port. The trip was an
uneventful one. The men caught sixteen
turtles after leaving Callao and the last
one was not consumed until San Diego
was reached. At San Diego, .is already
told in The Call, one of the cadets was
taken sick and died.
Captain Perkins is in command of the
Pathfinder and he is assisted by Execu
tive Officer Dow, Second Officer Glover
and Third Officer Atkinson. Chief Engi
neer Goldsborough is In charge of the
engine room and Eugene Wheat is pay
master. The Pathfinder is anchored in
naval row, just astern of the Marble
head and lowa.
The German gunboat Geier went to soa
yesterday. She will stop at Esquimau,
H. C, and will then go for a cruise in
Bering S.>a.
The steamer Sequoia had a narrow es
cape yesterday. She went on Duxbury
reef, but was got off without assistance.
Owing to the dense fog Captain Thurieg
had stopped the engines, having run up
his distance, and the vessel was drifting
with the tide. The first intimation of
danger was when the vessel struck. She
stayed on the reef about four hours and
then came off. She had on board 175,000
feet of lumber, and as soon as it is dis
charged she will be docked for an ex
amination. Captain Thurieg does not
think the hull is materially damaged.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
steamer Coptic, which arrived from the
Orient Sunday night, had aboard eighty
cabin, fourteen second cabin and 536 Jap
anese and three Chinese steerage pas
sengers. On September 3 she spoke the
four-masted British bark Ancona, bound
from Manila for New York, and on Sep
tember 12 the mail steamer Aiameda

from San Francisco for Honolulu. The
transports Siani and Leelanaw were in
Honolulu when tho Coptic w;;s there. Al
fred Watson, a hospital steward on the
Sinm, had his lep broken by one of the
horses. The teamsters on the Leelanaw
were on a strike and threatening- to de
sert. They asserted that two of their
number were left behind and they had
to work double to make up for their loss.
They were not allowed on deck during
the voyage, and the crew of the Coptic
said they were only awaiting' a chance
to leave the transport. The" horses on
both transports were landed and put
aboard again in splendid health.
The schooner Anna was in collision with
the battleship [owa y< sterday, but very
little damage resulted. The schooner wag
beating out from the wharf, when the
wind fell light and the ebb tide carried
her down on the warship. The captain
let go his anchor, but it was too late
to prevent the Anna from carrying away
the lowa's boat boom.
The ship Bohemia arrived from the can
neries last night. John Sodeberg. one of
the crew, had his leg badly broken and
he was sent to the German hospital as
soon as the vessel anchored. During
some heavy weather one of the water
casks went adrift and while trying to
secure it. SodPberg had his leg crushed.
The men on the auxiliary cruiser Bad
ger consider they only enlisted for the
war. and that in consequence they are
being illegally kept on the vessel. Nine
teen of them deserted some weeks ago
and the others assert they will "jump
the ship" on the first opportunity. In
consequence Commander Miller has
stopped all shore liberty and the men are
growling worse than ever.

JUSTICE RODDEN'S METHODS.
JUSTICE RODDEN of Marin County has bee.i
: exposed in the double offense of
â â running in advance oi any heating or trial
.;: i : Igmcnt against Frank L. Perkins, .1
tin si ourt, and of defacing the records ol
iurt for the purpose of destroying the proof of
i'lie motive for the judgment oi
â¢ ided ui>< m before a word of evidence was
submitted appears from the statements of the justice
â¢: one of personal spite against the
ment of the record was a fu
nd cowardly attempt tv escape the consequences
- action.
The evil of the wrong done by the Justice is aggra
; by the circumstances under which it was com
mitted. The charge upon which he made up his
mind in advance was not made against Perkins alone.
It iÂ« riminai libel -worn out by one .M.
. si John D. Spreckels as proprietor
of The Call and Frank L. Perkins, the San Rafael
correspondent of the paper. Against Mr. Spreckels
the Justice had no I ptte, and it appears he
to have been given at least a hearing before con
demnation, but against the other defendant the de
cision was made at once.
n which the Justice recorded his
noting. Upon the back of the
complaint he A'rote: "It appearing to me that the
nse in the within deposition mentioned has been
committed, and that there is sufficient cause to be
lieve tin within named Frank L. Perkins guilty
thereof, I order that he be held to answer to the same
and committed to "
Thus by the record- of hi^ court and in his own
handwriting did it appear that even before the trial,
the submission of evidence. Justice Rod
den had made up his mind to decide Perkins guilty
and hold him for trial. An offense of that nature is
about as a petty mind can devise and a cow
ature perpetrate. Tt is significant at once of
In- meanness, his malice, his revengeful instincts and
irdice. It atti sts that he is not only unrit for
the office he holds, but i- not worthy of social recog
nition in any decent community.
It is possible, of course, that Mr. Perkins has been
the only victim of the spite of this malicious fool in
office. Nevertheless it must be borne in mind that
other persons against whom Rodden has a prejudice
may have been haled before his court and compelled
to submit to such judgment as his malice prompted
without regard to evident, A malicious mind finds
cause for enmity on every side, and not a few of the
residents within his di-tricf Who have excited his spite
may have been made to suffer as much of wrong as
he has had the courage to inflict.
The case is one that call- lor little comment. The
fact? of themselves are sufficient to arouse public in
dignation. In the Justice Courts are tried the causes
and the -nits of the common people. The great mass
of small law case- and criminal charges of all kinds
are heard before such magistrates. A considerable
number of persons who are summoned before Jus
tice Courts are neither rich nor influential, and are
therefore dependent lor justice upon the integrity of
:irt itself. It is therefore imperative that the
magistrates of such courts be honest men. and the
fact that such a spiteful fool as Hodden presides as a
Justice of the Peace in Marin County constitutes a
menace to the property and the liberty of every citi
zen in his district.
â nor Gage would not declare a holiday to do
honor to the return of the California Volunteer.,.
Governor Roosevelt of New York has declared two
holidays in honor of the home-coming of Dewey. It
.-'ll depends upon the caliber of the Governor, and
everybody knows that Roosevelt is a big gun.
Lieutenant Peary, according to the latest reports,
has lost his toes through freezing in the far north.
One would hardly suspect the lieutenant of so bad a
if "cold feet."
There is no truth in the statement made by a morn
ing contemporary that the Republicans of San Fran
cisco are grooming a dark horse for Mayor.
After the Trust Conference at Chicago comes the
Anti-Trust Conference at St. Louis, but it won't be
.mi improvement.
Bryan did not wish his speech at Chicago to be
construed as a reply to Cockran, and it is safe to say
it will not be.
THE STATE FAIR
TIU-: great success of the State Fair at Sacra
mento is gratifying tv every public-spirited
California!!. ,
Prior to midsummer The Call kept before the pco
j pie reasons why the annual exposition of the States
resources and energies should be a success, and pre
dicted that it would excel any previous effort oi re
cent years in that line.
When men err in their plans and policies in the
conduct of such an exhibition criticism of their error
is proper without having in it any rancorous personal j
element. The directory of the State Agricultural So- j
ciety had been for years a rather dose corporation, :
â  which seemed to have secured for itself perpetual
succession. Perhaps rather too much of its time and
attention were given to the continual intrigue re
quired to maintain such succession, and too little to
; the vast and progressive changes and advances made ;
; in the interests in whose behalf the fair was intended j
to be held. Too much weight was put upon the im- |
portance of that great productive industry, pool
selling and bookmaking, and only the mistaken di
rectory was to blame if agriculture, horticulture, mm'
â  ing, lumbering, manufacturing, the vintage and the
arts and sciences, which engage the thought and toil
of SO many of our people, felt that they were reduced
', to a secondary place. It was this feeling that gener- I
I ated the hostility which threatened entire withdrawal
of the State's patronage of the State Fair.
This year's experience has changed all'this. The
newer energies and fresh personalities which appeared
[in the directory have proved to be abreast of the times,
j equal to the original purpose of the exhibition, and so
' in touch with the vital interests of the State as to be
i able to make the occasion not only a revelation of ;
''â  what has been done by the people, but a distinct and
valuable inspiration to their further effort and greater i
! progress. The board. From it- active and sympa
thetic president to its keenly intelligent secretary,
came into touch with every interest, and the result
has been the gratifying success which we were able
to predict in advance out of abundant faith in the
effect of a changed and bettered policy.
The track took its proper place, as the means of
Stimulating interest in one form of the State's ma- '.
terialitics. as necessary to show the climatic effect
favorable to the development of the horses descended
from Diomed and Rysdyk's Hambletonian as a load
and harness are to test the traction power of the
Percherons, Normans, Cleveland Bays and other draft !
horses. In other words, it was a feature of the ex
hibition that illuminated instead of obscuring all other
features, and was so conducted as to add to the amuse
ment and pleasure of the time without detracting
from its many other pleasures and amusements.
The show of neat cattle, sheep, -wine and all do
mestic animals was convincing of a fact that is more
general in the economies of California than in any
ttlier State In the Eastern States what came to be j
; known as "native breeds" had to be slowly bred out
to make room for stock that had been intelligently
bred for ages toward a definite utility. The shaggi
and scraggy native cattle, dwarfed in carcass and
deficient in quality through shifting for themselves
for many generation-, yielded slowly to the beef
breeds and to the Jerseys carefully developed for the
creamery as pro. hirer- of butter fats, and the Hol
stein.> and Dutch-Frisians, as carefully selected for
their conversion of forage into casein, for use in the
cheese Factory. In like manner the native hog. with
hi- snout elongated in his struggle for existence, be
cause in each succeeding generation he had to root
deeper or die. retired sullenly before the Suffolk,
Chester-White, Poland-China and other -trains care
fully bred to get the most pork on the shortest leg.
and whose snouts were shortened by removing the
necessity for incessant rooting. As with cattle and
-wine it was >\ith sheep, chickens and all animals that i
flock or herd upon the farm.
In California, new land and free from a past as it
was, from almost the beginning of agriculture the
ranchers equipped themselves with improved breeds,
and so it has come to passthatfrom horses to dogs one
find- but few scrubs or curs. The State Fair this year
impressed this fact upon strangers and all visitors.
Our people know the economy and profit of keeping
the best, and secure it. They would a- soon think of
planting orchards of choke pears and choke cherries
as stocking their pens and pastures with common cat
tle and razor-spined hi \i;s.
The directors deserve credit and praise for making j
the fair a demonstration of all this, and the Citizens'
Committee, through which Sacramento so usefully
co-operated, may vit-w its labor-, with the keenest
satisfaction, inasmuch as for the iir-t time in many
years the fair has passed without giving pretext for
the criticisms degenerating into libel, which have here
tofore been rife in the State. It is manifest that mak
ing the fair a success, interesting in it every producer
and public-spirited citizen within our borders, lias not
only eliminated offensive features, but has given the
press and people something useful to think of and so
has diverted attention away from rinding faults and
flaws.
The report that the Dreyfus indignation meeting
called to assemble at Hyde Park, in London, at
tracted only the usual idlers of the city recalls the
statement made by the London Chief of Police some
years ago that no matter what kind of meeting was
called in the parks or squares of London it was al
ways the same crowd that assembled. A whole lot
of noise that passes for the voice of an indignant peo
ple is after all only the clamor of irresponsible per
sons who shout just because they have nothing else
to do. and applaud at a mass-meeting as other folks
applaud at a theater.
BRYAN AMD COCKRAN.
IT has not gilded any <>f the plumes in Mr. Bryan's
helmet that he suffered himself to take part in the
Trust Conference at Chicago and be put in con
trast to men who are in the habit of preceding speech
upon any subject with thought on that subject.
His refusal to debate with Hon. Bourke Cockran
was an exhibition of over caution incompatible with
his attitude of infallibility. He first became notorious
through a persistently repeated challenge to Mr.
Cleveland and Mr. Carlisle to enter into joint debate
with him. His fervid fondness for that means of
manifesting himself seems to have cooled to such an
extent that alter his meeting with Cockran was an
nounced he flinched and retreated. An attentive read
ing of Cockran's speech and of Bryan's, delivered
next day. reveals the cause of the Nebraska man's
abstention from combat. Cockran's speech is a mas
terly statement of the trust issue, its cause and its
remedy. The remedy requires no doubtful interpreta
tion of constitutional power, but is ample and amply
within the powers now derived from the fundamental
law. His exposition of the need of a statute of pub
licity and the means of legal restraint puts a dear hori
zon to the whole question.
Mr. Bryan's speech remarketed the platitudes of his
San Francisco speech, especially his arrant and inex
cusable misquotation from Lincoln, and, instead of a
clear horizon, put around the whole issue a circular
fogbank in which his voice droned like a foghorn,
THE PAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY. SEPTEMBER 19, 1899.
â  which warns of a danger without suggestion ot a rem
i edy. As Cockran had declared that among the means
'of reducing the power of a trust tariff protection
should be withdrawn from it, Bryan, in order to an
tagonize him, disputed this, and his supporters will
be pained to have such a big spoke knocked out of
I their wheel. For the rest he contented himself with
! running up and down the gamut of "solemn warnings"
! and "viewing with alarm/ The situation affected him
badly, and there ran through his speech an undertone
of conviction that Bryan himself is the remedy for all
public evils. He is evidently of opinion that he is a
â  pill that will cure the national liver of its torpidity, and
! a nerve and bone liniment which will set right the
sprains and bruises of the national body. \\ hen he
speaks he thinks, but his thought is: "Take me. I
am the arnica and the Pond's extract; the liver pad
and porous plaster; the cholagogue and emulsion; no
other required.''
His .quackery, like all quackery, depends on words,
, words, high-sounding terms and phrases. Cockran
: measured him perfectly when he said: "I am free to
confess that when you have called an aggregation of
capital a combination, "a hydra-headed monster, an
octopus." you cast no light that can illumine my
pathway. I can understand how the use of these
phrases can have some effect, as nothing frightens
pebple so much as incomprehensible names. Let a
r.oise be made now that we don't understand and we
I will all be looking out of the windows. Men can be put
to intellectual flight by the terrifying noises of sound."
That is the correct estimate of Mr. Bryan as a tocsin,
a drumhead, a gourd lull of peas, making a noise that
is inexpressive of thought. His idea of politics is
copied from the Chinese idea of war. Instead of in
venting defensive arms and paying attention to tac
tics, the Chinese military establishment encourages
the invention of gongs, tomtoms and other racket
producing instruments which can make such a jargon
of sound as to terrify the enemy with a noise which
it never heard before and therefore is afraid of.
But Mr. Bryan is not a new invention. He emitted
sound and propagated fury in 1806, and has been at
' it ever since. His noises are all registered and known
and excite no more terror than the vesper braying
of the useful jack or the matin gurgle of a Shang
â  hai rooster.
The story that General Otis sentenced a soldier to a
year's confinement in Bilibid prison solely because
the soldier wrote a letter to the general without ob
taining a permit from his regimental officers is in
teresting as a campaign tale, but is not likely to be
true. General Otis is not popular and may not be a
great commander, but there is no reason for believ
ing he has turned into a senseless tyrant.
SOMETHING other than accident must be the
controlling cause of so many railway catas
trophes following one another with such rapid
succession as have taken place on the Southern Pacific
system within this State since the notable one at New
man last July, in which two tourists on their way to
the educational convention at Los Angeles were killed
;uid eight other persons injured.
If each case be considered alone doubtless a good
showing can be made to prove it to have been caused
by unavoidable accident or by some carelessness
of subordinate employes of the road, but when the
whole scries is* taken into consideration and the fact
is noted that since July there have been ten accidents
(Mi the Southern Pacific system, it will certainly ap
pear to intelligent men there must be something
wrong with the management of the roads. What we
call "accidents" arc as subject to law as other events,
and when they occur with groat frequency on a par
ticular system of railways and in a particular locality
it is a fair inference that the law which determines
them i^ one lor which the management is largely re
sponsible.
In cases of this kind that arc to come before the
courts in the trial of suits for damages The Call has
no desire to inflame the popular mind <>r to excite
prejudice against the company. Still it is evident that
something should be done to enforce upon the South
ern Pacific Company a better supervision of its roads
in this State and a safer manner of operating them.
Whether it be the economy enforced by the president
and hoard of directors, or whether it be the incom
petency of the general manager, it is clear that 'acci
dents are too numerous and follow one another too
rapidly.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury at the inquest
upon the bodies of the victims of the Famoso wreck
is that they came to their death by a collision of trains
"due to the negligence of the employes of the South
ern Pacific." That presents the subject as far as the
Coroner's inquiry could go, and perhaps in that case it
maj* be as far as the most searching inquiry could
have gone, but in many instances the wrecks due ap
parently to negligence of employes may have been the
result of overwork or of the employment of inefficient
men on account of economy. The punishment of sub
ordinate employes will have no effect in determining
the company to improve its management and exer
cise a truer economy hereafter. What is needed is
some means of making the managers of the roads
feel their responsibility and take the steps required
to make railway accidents less frequent.
An English army officer is in this country for the
purpose of securing a thousand mules for use in
South Africa. This wandering so far from the seat
of expected trouble is a tacit admission by the Brit
ish that all the harsh things they have been saying
about the mulishness of the Boers are untrue.
Whenever the war cloud hangs most darkly over
South Africa old man Kruger writes an evasive re
ply to the British, and before they can make out what
he means the clouds roll by and the negotiation^

RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.
IRRIGATION INVESTIGATIONS
WILL BEGIN IN CALIFORNIA
The Government Has Appointed Professor Harry H. Hirst of
> the University of California on the Important Work.
Mr. Edward P. Adams, Wrights, Cal.â Dear Sir: I have the honor to ac
knowledge the recelpi of your letter of August 30, inclosing a petition signed
by citizens of California, asking that Mr. Elwood Mead be detailed 'by the de
partment i.. conduct a series of irrigation Investigations in California.
The importance am! desirability of such an investigation are readily granted,
and it is the desire of the department to conduct such investigation as your pe
titioners desiiv, and to do this promptly and efficiently. It does not. however, seem
feasible to detail Mr. Mead to work continuously in California in immediate
charge of this investigation, as his duties as expert in charge of all the irri
gation Investigations of the department require that most of his time shall
be given t<> the general supervision of this large enterprise. Mr. Mead, has,
however, given considerable time to the consideration of the needs of irrigated
agriculture in California and to determining who are proper agents for con
ducting useful investigations in each State.
On his recommendation. Professor Harry H. Hirst of the University of Cali
fornia has been Belected to have immediate charge of this investigation, and pro
vision has been made for the employment of assistants as far as may be
necessary to secure the prompt completion of the work. Professor Hirst will
be given leave of absence by the University of California, so as to devote his
time and energies fully to our work. The plans and instructions for this work
will be drawn by Mr. Mead and he will give the enterprise close supervision by
visiting California from time to time and corresponding with our agents there.
1 trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory to your petitioners and to
the people <'f California and that you will assure the signers of this petition that
both tli.' Secretary of Agriculture and myself, as well as Mr. Mead, highly
appreciate the int. rest which they have manifested in the irrigation investiga
tions of the department and that we earnestly desire to accomplish results in
our work in California which will be of much use to the vast agricultural in
teresta of that greal St;it<\ Very respectfully yours, A. C. TRUE. Director.

PRESS COMMENTS
The Situation Exaggerated.
saunas maex.
A Castroville correspondent of the San
Francisco Examiner gives a highly ex
aggerated account of iish dying in the
Salinas River near that place, which is
attributed to the water used at the
Spreckels sugar factory Mowing into the
stream. The correspondent in question
wants the factory closed down and says
that a special meeting of the Hoard of
Supervisors will be called to tak> action
upon the matter. The alleged facts aro
for the most part the offspring of a lively
Imagination. The situation is greatly ex
aggerated. Besides, it would be better
thai i very tish in the river should die
from the factory to Moss Landing than
that the big mill should be shut down. All
persons living along the river have wells
for domestic use.

obliged to put the one-cent revenue
stamp on the shipping receipt. This is
the second decision that has been ren
dered against the company, and it seems
that it is about time that J. J. Valentine.

everything that affects the coffers of the

SOME OF BURNS' VOTES.
Red Bluff Sentinel.
Tho Woodland Mail seems to think that
T). M. Burns should Vie elected Senator
because the San Francisco press has lied
about him. The residents of this State
have been acquainted with him and his
record for the past twenty years. It
should be sufficient to defeat him that the
great majority of the people don't want
him. If there should he an election held
and the question should be Burns or no
Senator, Colonel Dan would not pet over
100 votes in Tehama County, and all the
balance would be "no Senator."

I unless the sender prepaid the war tax
which the Government designed that the
I company should pay. The company so far
; has lost all suits of this kind, and if the
: public would bring action on each case
for $'â  and costs, from the judgment on
which there can be no appeal, the wealthy
corporation would Boon find it more ex
pensive to shirk its payment of the war
tax than to pay it.

AUSPICIOUS OPENING OF
ST. ANTHONY'S CHURCH FAIR
THE fair and bazaar in aid of St.
Anthony"* Church and school on
Army street, near Folsora, was
auspiciously op< ned last evening,
and judging from the large crowd in
att< ndance it is safe to say that the
object for which the fair is being
given, namely, the lifting of the
church and school debt, will be fully
accomplished.
The largo auditorium mi the -
floor of the school building has been
pressed into Berviee for the fair, which
will last two weeks. Some fifteen
booths have been artistically arranged
around the sides of the hall and many
charming young ladles <>f the parish
vied with one another in selling arti
:" all descriptions to the chari
tably inclined.
The exercises last evening in honor
of the opening consisted of a few In
troductory remarks l>y Father Ra
phael Fuhr. pastor of the church, who
explained the obje< ts of the fair and
made an earnest appeal to those pres-
Icnd their financial assistance
!!â  raising the necessarj funds. He
then Introduced Mayor Phelan. who
delivered the address of the evening.
The Mayor congratulated Father Ra
phael and the people under his charge
on the laudable w.irk in which they
are engaged, th;u of teaching the
youthful mind. He spoke of the rapid
growth of the surrounding section
which a few years ago was a com
parative wildenu ss. He concluded
;: :^.. by urging his hearers to din down
deep in their pockets for the occa
sion.
The muslral portion of the pro
gramme consisted of vocal numbers
by a chorus of forty voices, led by
Father Raphael, and piano and zither
bi lei tions by the following young la
dies: Misses Lulu ('urtts, i-iouise
Ruegg, May and Frances Schoenst'in,
[xtuise and Constance Schmitz and
Emma Christen.
It is the intention to have an in
teresting programme every evening
during the fair, which will also be
opened Tuesday. Thursday and Satur

SHIP AND CARGO BURNED AT SEA.
THE American ship George Stetson and her cargo of 1,205.4,7 feet of lumber have been destroyed by fire. The Q
news came from Nagasaki, Japan, to the Merchant*' Exchange yesterday. The telegram simply stated that the C
vessel and cargo had been "destroyed by lire on the Lnoohno Islands," and that "no lives were lust." j|
The Stetson was in trouble from the time she left New York over a year ago. Captain Murphy was arrested jt
on the arrival of the vessel here on a charge of having been Implicated in the death of one of his sailors on the s
high seas. The ship went to the Columbia River and Captain Murphy came down to attend the trial. He was ac- oj
quitted, miii] on his way back to Portland caught pneumonia and died. Â£
Captain Patton was then sent from San Francisco and took charge of the vessel. He had a great deal of trouble .J
getting a crew, ami the vessel lay a month at Astoria before she was manned. Finnlfy a crew was secured here and C
s<-nt north to the ship. On July 19 the Stetson pot away from the Columbia River for Taku. China, and she had not *
been heard from until yesterday. The Loochoo Islands are between Japan and Formosa, and the general opinion is o *
that when the vessel reached them on her way to China the crew fired the vessel, as there was no love lost between Â£
the officers and men. *,
The George Stetson was to have gone from China to Honolulu to load supar for New York. She was built In ISSO Â£
by Arthur Sewall & Co. at Hath, Me., and was 1710 tons net burden. She was 232 feet 9 Inches long, 41 feet 3 inches <ji
broad and 26 feet 3 Inches deep. C
bearlnK on the contest in 1900, It is important
that new questions that have forced them
selves Into the canvass should be thoroughly
understood by our voters before election day.
We feel that, by reason of your familiarity
with and participation In current national af
fairs you could present the Issue* In a man
ner so convincing eh to dispel opposition and
add greatly to our majority.
I therefore, earnestly request your accep
tance, and ask that you inform us what dates
will be most convenient for you. With kind
rejrards, very truly yours.

STRIKE ON THE
TRANSPORTS IS
NOW UNDER WAY
Boilermakers on Two
Ships Walk Out.
PAINTERS MAY FOLLOWTO-DAY
COAL-PASSERS AND FIREMEN
MAKING TROUBLE.
The strike on the Government trans
ports has begun. It is only a small be
| ginning, but there is no telling where it j
j will end. If mutual concessions are not j
j made it may end in the transport service
being driven away from San Francisco.
I Uncle Sam and the contractors are not in
j a position just now to dictate terms, but
â¢ the time is not far off when they will be
; able to do so, and then the workmen and
: the city may suffer.
Yesterday the boilermakers on the Ta
coma and Sheridan struck. They demand
i ten hours' pay for a day's work of eight
! hours, and twenty-six hours' pay for a
night's work of eleven hours. The con
tractors offer ten hours' pay for a nine
i hour day and twenty-two hours' pay for
jan eleven-hour night. The night scale
! applies on both sides to Sundays and hol
idays. The transport Glenogle is to be
examined by the United States Inspectors
of Hulls and Boilers, after which there
i will be considerable work to do on her.
' After her will come the Sherman, Valen-
I cia, Charles Nelson, Zealandia, Olympia, ;
Lennox and Victoria, and if any of them 1
are delayed by the strike it is going to be |
bad for the port.
The demands of the machinists have |
been acceded to, and all the men are
working with a will. The painters have !
made no move, and the chances are that |
they will not, as there are hundreds of j
men eager to take their places. The men i
held a meeting last night, at which the i
matter In dispute was discussed. To-day ]
the result of their deliberations will be
[aid before Captains Barneson and Ben
nett, and some understanding may be
reached.
"The men are going the right way to
drive business away from the port," said
Captain Barneson yesterday. "They are
now employed more steadily than they
have been for years, and because
work is more abundant they want more
pay. It can only result in one thing. If
the men insist upon their demands the
transports will be fitted out somewhere
else. It will be a hard blow to this port,
but the workmen will be co blame for it
all."
The coal passers and firemen on the i
transport Centennial struck last Sunday. '
They refused to work because they were
entitled to a day off. Yesterday morning
they were all paid off and a new crew put
in their place. The Centennial will prob
ably get away to-day with a cargo of
I horses.
George W. Daubs, a painter on the
transport Tacoma, was nearly choked to
death by a fellow v >rkman named Kear
ney yesterday. Daubs asserts that Kear
ney is a "scab" and a poor workman.
Daubs was Bet to work painting the of
ficers' hospital, and Kearney went to
work on the soldiers' quarters. Daubs
was finished first and was sent to help
Kearney. They got to quarreling, and
Kearney struck Daubs on the face with
a paint brush full of paint. He then got '
Daubs down in the scuppers and was i
i choking him to death when the other
' painters rushed in and separated them.
What with the paint and the choking
Daubs was nearly dead, and had to be I
. rushed over to the hospital ship Relief for I
treatment. To-day he will swear out a
warrant for the arrest of Kearney.
ILncon Parlor to Go Fishing.
Rlncon Parlor No. 72, Native Sons of
the Golden West, has arranged to go on a
fishing excursion on the steamer Point
Arena to the Oordell hanks on Saturday
next. The boat will leave at 11 o'clock In
the forenoon from Mission street wharf,
and it will carry but 110 persons.
The drum coips composed of members
of this parlor has elected the following
named as its officers for the current term:
L. F. Berlcano, president; George \V.
Korts. secretary; Henry Raeoulliat. finan
cial secretary, and F." McCarthy, treas
urer. The corps will go on the excursion
to drum up the fish.
Still More Counterfeiting.
The Secret Service has just unearth. another
band of counterfeiters and secured a large
quantity of hojrus bills, which are so cleverly
executed that the average person would never
suspect them of being spurious. Things of
great value are always selected for Imitation,
notably Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, which has
many imitators but no equals for disorders like
indigestion, dyspepsia, constipation, nervous
ness and general debility. Always go to relia

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. There was a further !
drastic liquidation of speculative accounts on j
the Stock Exchang in response to the contin- !
lied attraction of credits by the banks, who
entered upon a struggle to maintain their re
perves within the legal limit. Since Friday
ir.crt' than enouch money has trona, from the
inks to the sub-treasury and the interior to
wire out the. Insignificant surplus show.:-, by
Saturday's hank statement. As only a half
hour was afTuioed after the appearance of the
Ftatemr-nt on Saturday for the liquidation
of accounts, a very large volume of soiling
orders from all quarters had accumulated in
brokers' hands when the market, opened to-day.
Trices took a downward plunge on opening
transactions throughout the list. The profes
sional traders were very hold on the bear Bide
nnd helped on the decline by large sales for short
account. The highly speculative industrial
â¢specialties showed the must serious losses, the
opening sales showing anywhere from 2 to over
ft point* clipped from Saturday's last prices for
pretty much all of the active industrials. The
New York municipal stocks, Sugar, Tobacco,
the Iron and Steel stocks and the so-called
flower (tockfl as a group led In the decline.
Rock Island as a member of the latter croup
fell 3ViC. Declines In the railroads otherwise
were not a.Â« violent as in the specialties, but ex
tended very generally between one and two
points. The Bt-lllng was in thousand-share lots
and upward In practically all stocks dealt in
wlihin the first few minutes. The bears were
somewhat dazed by their own success and al
most Immediately proceeded to take quick
profits by buying to cover shorts. Rallies of
two to three points resulted in many stocks.
But before noon the pressure was renewed,
when a deluge of Brooklyn Rapid Transit was
poured upon the market. The New York Trac
tion and Gas stocks moved in close sympathy.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit dropped an extreme
!â¢'â¢Â». Metropolitan 5*4, Consolidated Gas 7. Man
hattan a 1 -*. Third avenue 4% and Brooklyn
Vnion Gas 6. The lowest prices of the day
generally were touched on this movement, St.
J'aul extending its loss to 2%. The very vio
lence of the movement invited some recovery
and soon after 1 o'clock prices generally hHiJ
tumwl upward. The evident relaxation of the
pressure to liquidate wairn-1 me bears that
they had oversold the market, and the buying
demand became rather urgent. Prices of th<i
specialties recovered from two to over four
points. The absorption of railroad stocks be
came quite conspicuous. New York Central M
pecially moving up 3V4 from the lowest and
any others rallying from one to two points.
KliKiit trains over Saturday's prices were re
corded for New York Central. Atchison pre
ferred, Burlington, Union Pacific preferred,
Reading Brst preferred. Northwestern and
Lackawanna. Best prices were not maintained
and the market closed easy. The late rally In
prices was assisted by an easing of the rate for
call money to 7 per cent. After ruling at 10
per cent a sharp drop of M per cent in the
actual rates for demand sterling and cable j
transfer, and the marking down of post rate* !
also had an Influence in relieving the strain |
on the stock market. Rumors were Circulated
of a con'erence of bankers to take measure*
looking to the relief of the money market by
an increase of circulation, but these were de
nied and bankers seemed free from anxiety
over the outcome. One bank only took out Â»l
ditional circulation according to reports from
Washington, and that to the extent of only
about $200,000. Since the first of thÂ»: month the
New York banks have Increased In circulation
lets than a million dollars. London sold heav- j
ily in this market on account of the Transvaal
excitement to the extent of itbout 40.000 snares
and no gold movement from that quarter seems
likely for the immediate future. The October
coupons of United States 4 per oÂ»nt bonus of
1907 were payable to-day at the sub-treasury,
and some slight relief was afforded to the
money market by that means. No reliable esti
mate is possible of the extent to which loans |
were liquidated to-day, but that repayments to
the bunks were very heavy i.Â« the testimony of
all r, i-hiiities on the subject.
Bonds were weak in sympathy with stocks,
and liquidation of the speculative issues were
on a large scale. Total sales, par value,

Chicago Wheat Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. IS.â WHEATâ Opened at an
advance of J .-4<s*ic from Saturday's closing
price, with a good general demand at those
figures. The cause of the advance was the
strength of cables on account of the critical
South African situation, and some rather lib
eral covering by shorts was done during the
first half hour's trading. The demand was
readily supplied, but though plenty of bearish
newp was on hand in regard to the crop move
ment and seedinr conditions the market held
up well until near the no.m hour. After the
first rush of buyers had been accommodated
trading became dull anil prices kept within a
narrow range. December rasing off slightly
from opening figures. September in the mean
time was decidedly strong on a narrow amount
of trading. Very little was offered for sale
and elevator >ole were moderate bidders.
prices in consequence advancing sharply early.
before noon December began to weaken partly
on account of the weakness In Wall street, but
principally on the indications of an enormous
increase in the visible, th" figures of which
were anally put at 8,171,000 bushels. Heavy
selling was done by one firm supposed to be in
the way of liquidation of a ing line. Most of

Broomhall cabled that the African situation
â¢was causing an advance in England, and the
Chicago market opened firmer in consequence.
The tone was given increased strength by
smaller receipts at Duluth and an increase In
Northwest stocks of only 750,000 instead of
1.100,000 bushels as expected. Later on, how
ever, an Increase of 3,000,000 bushels In the
visible supply discouraged holders and the
market closed weak, with no support. There
were large sales on Ban Francisco account.
The local market was kept up somewhat by
the covering of a large short line, but the feel
ing was weak and depressed, nevertheless.
Scarcity of shir* is keeping this market down.

melodious, overexpression does not drop
from the pen in its praise. The story '
goes over the old roads, with a few shy
variations, and one keeps tab upon the
progress of the story by cursory glances
at the argument. The dialogue is quite
ordinary, sometimes with a touch of dime
novel tragedy; but lor all that the produc
tion is lull "of interest for the musical
laity and the eye that hungers for spec
tacle, for the Quarrel; if indeed there be
any, is not wiih the treatment.
Everything is in fresh feather and the
stage pictures are more than satisfy
ing. The French soldiers are vividly got
up on the empire plan, Pt-rsse looking
lumseif like the Little Corporal, :mU ;
sometimes the grouping of the maidens
of the chorus suggests the Aubisson and
JJeauvais tapestries. Persse as Captain
Robert lives, loves and sings aspiringly j
ana finally wins his Stella (Miss Mason),
who during the troubled wooing has run
the gamut pi many disguises and ing at
least two pretty solos. Georgie Cooper
make? a fetching vivandiere, William
Wolf a sr.ld'erly drum major and Hattie
Ueile I.add a picturesque Griolet. The
minor oaris are wrll sustained. Miss Ma
son really has the musical opportunities,
but the chorus that closes the second act
wins the applause of the night. it was
suggestive of a selection sung by an aug
mented church choir at some fete season
and won four encores. Finally the march,
which worked away from the conventions,
left a pretty picture on the retina of every
healthy eye. Stage managers who can
train such are in the singular number.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Alcazar.
Tt would be difficult, indeed, to get a
better company to play "Too Much John
son" than the one headed by Eugene Or
monde at the Alcazar. Notwithstanding
its absurdities and improbabilities, the
farce retains its popularity, for it has
one good thing about it, .and that is
"fun." Clarence Montainc's' Frenchman,
a little off in his accent, was more than
compensated for by the excellence of his
acting. Webster was a roaringly buffo
Johnsonj and Charles King's Faddish was
artistic. Gertrude Foster's Mrs. Billings
was seriously played and proved a good
foil to the fun. while Marie Howe made a
hit as the vinegary mother-in-law. Or
monde was a cold-blooded enough Bill
ings, and Denithorne and Miss Helen

ers.

Tivoli.
Inasmuch a? "Othello" will attract
large houses because, of the two favorites,
Balas and Avedano, It will do no harm
to say a few words about "I^ohengrin."
Xo better opportunity is offered the true
music lover to show whether he is en
titled to this distinction than the produc
tion of a great musical masterpiece.
Such an exceptional work we have In
"Lohengrin." As the writer has heard
"Lohengrin" on one of the leading Ger
man opera stapes, he is fully able to say
that it is not necessary to hear this work
in connection with all the brilliant para
phernalia and surroundings wlta which
a big theater endows it in order
to judge its musical merit. You take the
Tivol! orchestra, rron LJerthald as Lo
hengrin. William Mert'-ns as Telramund,
and you cannot complain of being unable
to distinguish the magnificent musical
structure which Wagner has er-cted. A
mar: cannot claim a thorough knowledge
of our modern music unless he has seen
and heard at least the leading Wagnerian
operas, and surely "Lohengrin" is one of
these. The poetry, grandeur and splendor
which permeate this work are character
istic of the dramatic fervor which
stamped Wagner a revolutionist. There-
re, it is insufficient to watch the singers
only in order to extract all the musical
marrow from this work, but to appreciate

THE STUDY OF FOOD.
When a man knows that he depends
on food alone from which to make his
brains and that his success in life is
largely owing to the kind of brains he
lias, It would seem the part of wisdom
to study food a bit.
All men do not have the opportunity
to make a careful analytical study of
the subject and are satisfied to have
the food experts attend to this for
them.
A food especially made to supply
the nourishing elements needed to re-
build the brain and nervous centers
bears the name Grape-Nuts, and its
use for ten days or two weeks produces
a sturdy, substantial and powerful
condition of the thinking machinery,
enabling one to do things, to make
money or succeed in whatever enter-
prise is reasonably undertaken.
Systematic, logical, concentrated
thinking is the one requisite to success
and that needs good, healthy brains,
well nourished, and the waste supplied
each day. Grape-Nuts make their
energy known to the user, and, being

Orpheum.
The bill provided for the patrons of the
Orpheum last night was an exceptionally
strong one, and some of the new-comers
prove great favorites. Stinson and
Merton, eccentric singers, dancers and
dialogue artists, are very clever and
natural. Stinson is one of the funniest
entertainers that has appeared for a long
time. John S. Terry and Mabel Lambert,
tenor and soprano, "sing with rare charm,
and give a most pleasing act as the
"tough" young man and girl. Frederick
Halle-n and Mollle Fuller were well re
ceived in the one-act comedy "His WitVs
Hero." Bright Brothers can justly lay
claim to the designation "the sensational
athletes." The holdovers, the Hungarian
Boys' Military Band. Charley Case, the
Bacheli r Club and the Crawford Slaters,
complete the attractive bill.

GENERAL WARFIELD HOME.
Unimpaired in Health, the National
Guardsman Has Returned From
Philadelphia.
General Warfield, proprietor of the Cal
ifornia Hotel, returned yesterday morning
from Philadelphia, where he went to at
tend the annual encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic.
While there the general was stricken
down with the heat and was forced to
spend a couple of days in the hospital be
fore he was himself again. The accident
was reported here as a serious illness, and
greatly startled his numerous friends.
General Warfleld speaks very enthusias
tically of the celebration, which, to judge
from the crowds that attended it. must
have been magnificent. Over 40,000 veter
ans were In line, and the trainmen report
that not less than 350,000 visitors came to
the city to watch them march past as
they were reviewed by President McKin
ley.
The general reports that the sentiment
in the East is strongly against the con
tinuation of hostilities in the Philip]
and that all are in favor of dispatching
any number of men there that may be
deemed necessary to thoroughly quell the
trouble.
GENERAL REEVE ACQUITTED
Was Forced on Board the Transport
by the Jubilant Soldiers.
General C. Mi i . Reeve has been exon
erated by United States Attorney Coombs
fn>m the charge preferred by Federal
Quarantine Officer Kinyoun of having
boarded the Government transport Sheri
dan before the vessel had been passed
upon by the quarantine authorities.
The testimony of Customs Inspector
Harrigan, taken before Mr. Coombs yes
terday morning, convinced Mr. Coombs
that the general had been dragged aboard
the Sheridan by brute force, aided and
abetted by his coat collar.
Mr. Harrigan said that boats of all
kinds were coming to and going from the
vessel, and that the gang-way ladder was
high enough to keep people from coming
on board. Two soldiers were on guard,
and the witness ordered them to prevent
anybody from boarding the vessel. Gen
eral Reeve came alongside and tried to
obey Harrigan's order. In fact, he drew
back as well as he could, but the soldiers
raised him up bodily and he was forced
aboard.
MINNESOTAN HOSTS.

The speech of Governor Dind was par

thÂ»- future might afford the people of
Minnesota an opportunity to show thÂ© ap

RECOVERED HIS MONEY.
A Peculiar Bobbery in a McAllister-
Street Barber-Shop.
R. D. Sexton, a barber, and his wife
arrived in this city Sunday night. from
Still water, Minn. They had been mar
ried only a few weeks, and at the sug
gestion of his wife Sexton concluded to
I visit this city in the hope of making a
â  living for himself and his bride. Yester
day morning he secured employment in
I a barber shop at 220 McAllister street.
i During the afternoon he missed his vest,
which contained $tW in greenbacks and a
draft for $200. Sexton at once reported
his loss to Captain Seymour, who, after
listening to his story, detailed Detective
Anthony on the case. Failing to get a
j satisfactory report from him, and touched
by the tearful appeal of Sexton, Cap
tain Seymour visited the barber shop and
proceeded to make a thorough Investi
gation. Convinced that the vest with its
precious contents had been tak> n by
j some person connected with the saloon
adjoining, ho closely questioned the bar
i tender and the habitues of the place.
Just as Seymour concluded his Investi
gation he received a telephone communi
cation from Attorney Charles Reynolds,
Informing him that he had Sexton's
property, and asking him to call at hie
office. Seymour refused to see him, and

ARISTIDES GILLET WAS
THE DROWNED BOY
LUNCH BASKET AND FISHING
TACKLE WERE IDENTIFIED.
Worked in the Day, Attended School
at Night and Went Fishing for
Recreation, of Which
He Had Little.
The boy who was swept off the Olympic
pier by a huge breaker last Sunday morn
ing was Aristides Gillet, the 15-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gillet of the
Belford lodging house, 10*55 Market street.
The grief-distrapted parents were con
fronted yesterday with the proof of their
son's loss on the ocean beach when they
saw the little fellow's lunch basket and
fishing reel that had been cast up on the
beach by the waves.
Young Aristides, who was known by
his playmates as "Arthur," worked as a
cash boy in the White House on Kearny
street to assist his parents in earning a
living and was a very well behaved and
faithful employe. In order to be more
useful and that he might iftJt lose an op
portunity for education he went to night
school so that he voluntarily debarred
himself from that recreation which is so
much needed and enjoyed by the young.-
On Saturday he told his mother that he
would like to go fishing- on Sunday near
the Cliff House and promised to be home
by 5 o'clock in the afternoon. On Satur
day night he arranged the tackle and put
Up his lunch and was delighted with the
prospect of a good day's sport.
His parents worried all night when he
did not return, and tried to console them
selves with the theory that the boy might
have changed his mind and gone to Oak
land and missed the last boat. As soon
as the morning paper arrived yesterday
they looked over it, dreading to find what
they did findâ the news of the drowning
of their son.

SEEK SAN FRANCISCO MARKETS.
More Buyers Come on the Manufac
turers' and Wholesalers'
Excursions.
The thin! excursion of the Manufactur
ers' and Wholesalers" League arrived yes
â  from Oregon, Washington, Idaho
and Northern California, and many of th>
prospective buyers registered at the head
quarters at 2 r >2 Market street. So far the i
project to induce the coast purchasers
of goods to patronize San Francisco deal- i
ers Instead of sending orders to Eastern ,
â houses has been productive of good re
sults. There were on the first excursions
fr >m Ogden and the Northwest and the
second excursion from T^xas, New Mex
ico, Arizona and Southern California a
good representation of merchants, and
the amount of their purchases has war
ranted the undertaking nf the local manu
facturers and wholesalers.
The inducement of lower rates of trans
portation, etc., has brought to this city
a thoroughly representative lot of buyers,
whose dealings in San Francisco have
been so satisfactory that their future
patronage is assured. Nearly all ex
pressed surprise that this city had such a
varied and extensive quantity of goods to
show, and there was not one who did not j
state that coming direct to the market ,
I is more satisfactory than laying In their
k of wares, etc., by sample, as has
been done in the past. One or two of
those who received the benefits of the of
few mad- by the league took an unfair
advantage by enjoying all of the pleas
ures of a junketing trip at small cost to
themselves and made no returns by pur
chasing here. This was expected, but the
experience obtained will be the means of
guarding against impostors in the future.
TWO VERDICTS.
Coroner Hill Refused to Sign the One

Sunday by being run over by a street car

signed by Jurors David E. Harris, H. T.
Hauxhurst and Gecrge A. Beanston.
The Coroner refused to approve the ver

town knew that he kept anything of
value In his mom.
In speaking of the alleged robbery, Fos
ter says that when he went to the Chief
of Police's office some one turned him
over to Detective Shorey. "Mr. Shorey
impressed me with the necessity of keep
ing the matter very quiet," said Foster.
"I made an agreement with him that I
would pny him $:00 in gold coin if he
would recover the thousand dollars I
lost. I would not put up any money in
advance, however, because I once did
that and came out loser in Oregon. If
Mr. Shorey recovers my money I will
gludly pay him. At present we have no
clew to the rubber."
Chief of Police Hodgkins made this
statement to-night: "Last Friday Fos
ter reported his loss to this department.
Detective Shorey and Detective Holland
went to the Hotel Vendome and searched
his room. In a bureau they found $aso
in gold, which they forced him to deposit
in some bank. His trunk had been forced
open, and I am inclined to think that
the money was stolen from him. There
was no deal made with the detectives,
but Foster did say that he would will*
ingly give half of what was lost to re
cover the other half. There was no
agreement made, and I feel sure the de
| tectlves acted squarely. So far there is
no clew to the robber."
HELD THE BABY WHILE
MOTHER SOUGHT AID
OAKLAND, Sept. 18.â "Pop" Wells, the
County Supervisor, otherwise familiarly
known as "Honest Tom Wells," was the
victim to-day of what some of his con
freres on the Supervisorial board would
term a "joke in black and white."
Mrs. Mangram, a Peruvian, appeared
before the board asking for help. She
had a four-months-old baby with her.
She had to sign her affidavit, and "Pop"
Wells offered to hold the youngster while
the woman wrote her name. Mr. Wells
took the dark Infant up in his arms.
From the way the lobby and Supervisors
laughed one might say that the spectacle
was a joke in black and white.

he had received an offer of $1000 from

sum that would probably be needed. The

with Senator Perkins In raising the
amount needed. The committee will be

RAILROAD CASE THAT
PUZZLED AUTHORITIES
t OAKLAND, Sept. 18.â The proper mo- '
dus operandi in the prosecution of the â 
> Oakland Railroad Company for violating
I the city ordinance in not having two men
in charge of each car running on Alcatraz
i avenue, where little Esther Wahlstad was
! run over and killed a few weeks ago, is
| puzzling the authorities.
i At the preliminary examination held .n
I the Police Court the corporation, which is
! a tributary of the Southern Pacific Com
j pany. was held to answer. It was sup
! posed that the irial proper, therefore,
: would be held in the Superior Court, but
' it was discovered to-day that if there is to
; be a trial it also must be held in the Po
-1 lice Court.
"According to section 4427 of the Polit
', ical Code the Police Court has exclusive
, jurisdiction of all proceeding* for viola
! tion of any ordinance of the city, both
civil and criminal." said Deputy District
i Attorney Samuels tc-day. "I have looked
the matter up carefully. The Whitney
i act, a general law establishing Police
Courts, contains the same provision. To
; my mind the only method will be for the
Police Judge to impose the fine provided
for by law. Then the corporation may
apr^al from the judgment to the Superior
i Court, but thereafter there is no appeal
to a higher court, for the simple reason
' that the Police Court's jurisdiction is ex
â  elusive In this class of cases."
If the case is tried in the Police Court
it will be the first of its kind in the his
- tory of the Oakland Police Court.
HENRY S. MORRIS TURNS
TABLES ON HIS WIFE
OAKLAND. Sept. IS.â A motion to
quash service of summons and set aside
a default in the divorce suit of Lettie Ann
Morris against Henry S. Morris was
granted by Judge Greene this afternoon,
and defendant's attorney forthwith filed
an answer and cross-complaint, denying
the wife's allegations of cruelty and aver
ring that the suit was commenced for the
purpose of tying up the community prop
erty and harassing Morris, who at one
time was well to do. He was prominent
among the colored Masons and was some
years ago messenger in the Mayor's of
fice. San Francisco. After transferring
his property to his wife he went to Mon
tana became ill and in need, but hi? wife
refused to kid him financially. When he
succeeded in getting back to his Oakland
home one of his children closed the door
in his face, remarking that Mrs. Morris
would not see him. Since then Morris
has been dependent upon charity. In his
cross-complaint he alleges cruelty.
Dingee-Sather Libel Suit.
OAKLAND. Sept. IS.â Judge Greene has
settled the bill of exceptions in the appeal
taken in the suit of W. J. Dingee against
Mrs Jane K. Sather for $150,000 damages
for alleged libel. The appeal is based on
Judge Greene's refusal to dismiss the ac
tion on the ground that plaintiff at the
lime of tiling the suit had tailed to also
file a required bond.

SUIT OVER A CHILD
BORN ON THE YUKON
OAKLAND. Sept. IS. -Little Louise Yu
kon Beaumont was the subject of inter
esting habeas corpus proceedings heard
and determined before Superior Judge
Hall this afternoon. Six years ago the
child was born on the Yukon, in the
frozen northern gold fields, and about two
years ago the child was brought to Oak
land by her father, with instructions from
the mother that the child be placed ia
a convent. Instead, William Leaumont
placed the Yukon maiden in the care and
custody of Mrs. M. W. Teeple. residing at
1053 East Sixteenth street. Recently Mrs.
Beaumont learned that her instructions
had not be^n carried out. and a few days
ago she arrived here and demanded pos
session of her child. Mrs. Teeple refused
to give up the little one. on the ground
that the father had warned her against
doing so to any on* but himself. me
grieving mother to-day sued out a writ or
habeas corpus, and Judge Hall determined
that Mrs. Beaumont was a.s much entitled
to the custody of the child as the father,
and rendered a decision accordingly, ma
child will now be placed in a convent.

SHE PASSES HER DAYS

Strange Life of Amelia

of Feeble Mentality*
! T N the basement of a Rmnll house at
I 51 Jessie street, between First and

, chained t" the walL Her name Is
' Amelia Tarentlno, and the light of rea-

? Strange Hounds Issue from her mouth,
' and her face to twisted and contorted
( J in Ugly grimaces. Being of a destruct

? to the wall, allowing about five feet of
5 tether to the child, -who spends the
hours of daylight cuddled up in a cor
-5 ncr or groping about for something to
, pifll and tear.
Mrs. Tarantlno has been In San
5 Francisco but. a single week. Her
former home was Texas, where she
5 lived and raised her family, which
> consists of five children of graduated
ages. The girl is not the only feeble
-5 minded member of the family. A boy,
Joseph Tarentino, suffers from the
5 same mental malady, and he has been
before the Insane Commissioners of
Â» this city. As is natural with such
, abnormities of nature, the physique of
' both boy and girl is stunted, but the
{ boy had not evinced any of the vio-
ninety days' time from September 30 on their
contract to macadamize Army street from Do
lores to Church streets.

Age.
James do la Montanya, a prominent
merchant of this city, passed quietly
away last night at his residence, 1524 j
Taylor street. He was surrounded by his
family during the last hours. The de
ceased lived to a rii >â¢â  old age, being 80 I
years old at the time of his death. Dur- j
ing his lifetime he won the esteem of
his fellow miTi by his courtesy and in- i
tegrity. For the post forty years he had

and ranges and his large business occu
pies an imposing building which he bad

MR. DUNPHY'S WIFE.
C. M. Dunphy, an armless man, railed
upon United States Attorney Onomhs yes
terday and complained that his wife was
collecting his pension from the Govern
ment and not allowing him any "pin
money." He said he had been obliged to
beg a shave on more than one occasion
: by reason of the parsimony of his better
| half. His pension Is $](V) per month, and
he received it because he, lost his arms on
the Hartford under Farragut.
Mr. Coombs sent a letter to Mrs. Dun
i phy notifying her that it was illegaJ for
her to collect her husband's pension, and
i that she would be punished if she repeat
â  ed the offense.

RUSS IS NOT
A CANDIDATE
FOR MAYORALTY
Dark Horse Is Still in
Grooming Quarters.
A HUNT FOR SUPERVISORS
DEMOCRATS DESIRE TO EXCLUDE
OLD-TIME OFFICE-SEEKERS.
Iroquois Club Resolution May Pro
voke a Big Row in the
Democratic Con
vention.
To-night the Republican Convention's
committee on permanent organization
and order of business will meet at the
Grand Hotel. It is probable that a plan
of business proceeding will be adopted.
Henry B. Russ, ex-Supervisor and man
ager of the Russ estate, is not a candi
date for the nomination of Mayor. He is
not the real thing as a "dark horse," and
is not the one that the leaders of the
Republican League have in mind for the
race. When Mr. Russ was spoken to yes
terday on the topic of his proposed can
didacy, he remarked:
"I am not a candidate for Mayor and
would not accept the nomination if the
convention nominated me. Yes, several
delegates to the convention have men
tioned the subject and inquired of me if
1 would accept, but I told them that I
was not a candidate and would not under
any circumstances agree to run. My
business affairs render it impossible for
me to engage in politics at this time."
When it was suggested to Mr. Russ that
Zenas U. Dodge desired to bring him for
ward as a candidate, the former said:
"Mr. Dodge did not speak to me on the
subject." The question was asked: "Did
Henry T. Scott suggest your acceptance
of the nomination?" To this inquiry ~j.r.
Rosa replied: "Yes, Mr. Scott spoke to
me, suggesting that I should be a candi
date, but 1 toid him that I could not take
the time from my business which the
duties of the office would demand. I feel
extremely grateful for the newspaper and
personal comment, but my acceptance of
any political office this year is out of the
question."
At the Democratic fountain of inspira
tion the assertion is made in a positive
manner that the Republican "dark horse"
was trotted out in the person of Mr.
Russ, but at the headquarters of the
Republican .League the story is told that
the real "dark horse" is young in years
and full of spirit and go. The knowing
ones say: "Wait for a day or two for the
grooming, and you will see the winner
of the race."
No doubt seven or eight names will be ;
presented to the league caucus September !
28. Many Republictins believe that Hor- ]
ace Davis Is the strongest man men
tioned. Others asert that Captain John !
Uermingham would make an excellent
candidate. The advocates of youth speak !
of George Newhall, Henry J. Crocker and
Judge Slack. John Lackraann, who Is fre
quently mentioned as the leading candi
date for Sheriff, is being urged to run for '
Assessor. Before the campaign for nomi
nations draws to a close the popular
Supervisor may be pressed to run lor i
Mayor.
The Democrats are not making much
headway in the pursuit of acceptable men
for the Supervisorial ticket. A special |
effort to exclude old fossils is recom
mended to the committee of seven.
According to inside gossip, there is no !
intention of turning down old men other !
than those who are old in officeholding. |
Men are wanted whose names are not !
constantly l>efore the public. The seven !
Democrats who are charged with the duty j
of discovering eighteen first-class men ,
encounter obstacles at every meeting, j
Common fairness und good politics re- j
quire them to consider the names pre
sented by the various district delegations,
but when the obscure and untried are ;
excluded few remain but the old-timers of ,
the political arena. A well-known Demo- I
cratic leader remarked: "The stomach of I
the public revolts at the old dose. Young
men are not specially sought for, but j
modern men whose names have not been
before every convention of the past j
twenty years are wanted, and it is no
easy task to persuade them to give a
little time to the service of the city."
The row precipitated by the Iroquois
braves in demanding the scalp of every
gold Democrat may cause Fred Baldwin
to lose the nomination for County Clerk.
His name was signed to the resolution
characterizing the gold Democrats as
men who sacrificed principle for profit.
It Is said by the Democratic advocates
of sound money that L. F. Bylngton. who
Hales.
presided at the famous council of the
Iroquois, did not brighten his political
prospects when ho gave countenance to
the raid.
The Iroquois braves who are contempt
uously termed "old squaws and pie hunt
ers" will insist that the men who de
sert* d Bryan in 1896 shall be excluded
frnm the Democratic municipal ticket.
The bravea, or "squaws," insist that the
25.000 Democrats of San Francisco -^ho
voted for silver in 1896 shall direct the
affairs of the party. The followers of
Bryan talk of open revolt in the cvnt
of recognition by the convention of any
Democrat who gave his support to Mc-
Kinley in the last Presidential election.
