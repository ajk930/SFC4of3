GENERAL BULLER'S FORCE DEFEATED
WHILE TRYING TO CROSS THE TUGELA
Attempt of Commander in Chief of
the British Troops in South
Africa to Reach Ladysmith Re
sults m Disaster.
Boers Concealed Along the River Mow Down
the Advancing Foe, Causing the British to
Hastily Retreat, Leaving Eleven Guns and
Many Dead Behind.
LONDON. Dec. 16.â The War Office has received a dispatch announcing that General Buller has
met with a serious reverse, losing eleven guns. General Buller was attempting to cross the
Tugela River. Finding it impossible to effect his object he ordered a retreat in order to avoid
greater losses.
The following is the tevt of General Bulier's dispatch announcing his reverse:
"Buller to Lansdowne: Chieveley Camp. December 15. 6:20 p. m.â l regret to report a seri
ous reverse. I moved in full strength from our camp near Chieveley at 4 o'clock this morning.
There are two fordable places in the Tugela River, and it was my intention to force a passage
through at one of them. They are about two miles apart.
"My intention was to force one or the other with one brigade supported by a central
brigade.
"General Hart was to attack the left drift. General Hildyard the right road and General Lyt
telton was to take the center and to support either. Early in the day I saw that General Hart
would not be abie to force a passage, and I directed him to withdraw. He had, however- at
tacked with great gallantry, and his leading battalion, the Connaught Rangers. I fear, suffered a
great deal. Colonel LG. Brooke was seriously wounded.
"I then ordered General Hildyard to advance, which he did. and his leading regiment, the
East Surrey, occupied Colenso station and the houses near the bridge.
"At that moment I heard that the whole artillery I had sent to support the attackâ the
Fourteenth and Sixty-sixth field batteries and six naval 12-pounder quick-firers, under Coionel
Longâ had advanced close io the river in Long's desire to be within effective range. It proved to
be full oi the enemy, who suddenly opened a galling fire at close range, killing all their horses, and
the gunners were compelled to stand to their guns. Some of the wagon teams got shelter for the
troops in a donga, and desperate efforts were made to bring out the field guns. The fire, how
ever, was too severe, and only two were saved by Captain Scholfield and some drivers whose
names I will furnish.
"Another most gallant attempt with three teams was made by an officer, whose name ! will
Of the eighteen horses inirteen were killed- and as several drivers were wounded
I would not allow another attempt, as it seemed that they would be a shell mark, sacrificing life to
a gallant attempt to force the passage. Unsupported by artillery, I directed the troops to with
draw, which they did in good order.
"Throughout the day a considerable force of the enemy was pressing on my right flank,
but was kept back by mounted men under Lord Dundonald and another part of General Barton's bri
gade. The day was intensely hot and most trying on the troops, whose conduct was excellent
We have abandoned ten guns and lost by shell fire one. Th.3 losses in General Hart's brigade
are. I fear, very heavy, although the proportion of severely wounded. I hope, is not large The
Fourteenth and Sixty sixth Field Batteries also suffered severe losses. We have retired to' our
camp at Chieveley."

LONDON, Dec. r6.âEng
land went to sleep last night
without knowing the worst
news that has come from the seat
of war since hostilities began.
What time the War Office re
ceived the news of General ful
ler's reverse, which was practical
ly a defeat, is not known, but it
was after midnight when it made
public Buller's report.
While the report is fairly dear
it needs â¢elucidation in certain
parts, but there can he no mis
taking the results of the battle.
Eleven British guns lost, at
tempts by two columns to cross
the river repulsed with heavy loss
and the retreat to camp â that is
the outcome of Buller's first at
tempt to reach Ladysmith.
Two points in his report stand
out with tremendous significance
when the circumstances of the re
verses experienced by Methuen
and Gatacre are recalled. When
he moved out in full force from
Chieveley early yesterday morn
ing it was his intention to force
the passage at one of two ford
able places on the Tugela River,
but he discovered that this was
not feasible, owing to the fact
that the number of Boers had
been under estimated.
At Stormberg and Magersfon
tein the same fact was discovered,
but not until the British advance
had been surrounded by the mo
bile foe.
Again, as in these other two
engagements, the British on the
Tugela River were caught in an
ambush. The river bed at the
point selected by General Hild
yard's column to cross turned out
to be full of Boers, who over
whelmed the British artillery.
Ten guns had to be abandoned
and another was lost by shell fire.
Two were saved b>; the heroic

MORE TROOPS TO BE

His Defeat Regarded as the Most

LONDON. Dec. 15. 4:30 a. m.â The
news of General Roller's reverse
was received bo late that news
paper comment to-day Is confined to
perfunctory expressions of extreme
regret and disappointment and of
the necessity of calmness and redoubled
efforts to retrieve the position. This latest
check Is regarded as the most serious
event In Great Britain's military history
since the Indian mutiny.
The Standard says: "General Buller's

Is all the Rreater a* during the last forty
eight hours there had been reports of the
relief of Lsdysmtth. Yesterday the War
i tflic*- allowed it to be understood that me

factory. The reaction is all the more
i ron ninced on this account.
The gloomy information came too late
â¢â ice clntis. and only a few
,iists and straKcl- rs were waiting at
the War Office. It had hardly been real
ised until now. even after the experience
of the week, that General Buller could
fall.
Virtually nothing had he*Â»n allowed to
leak through regarding his preparation,
but the public waited patiently. In the
confident belief that he was taking *uch
time and precautions as would Insure suc
cess.
No independent reports of the engage
ment have yet been allowed to come
through, but General Buller'R own dis
patch tells the sad tale In sufficient out
lino to show that the British have been
entrapped again by the astute BOOTS. It
was not anticipated that General Duller
would make a frontal attack. No criti
cisms of his movements are made, how
ever, since apparently he suffered a re
pulse rather than a defeat, and did not

some drivers.
It seems almost incredible that
the artillery should have ap
proached so near the river with
out cavalry or even infantry skir
mishers having first developed
the enemy's position. Colonel
Long, who was in command of
the batteries, seems to have only
discovered that the river was full
of Boers when he got quite close
to it with his guns. He was sub
jected to a galling fire at close
range, which killed his men and
horses before he could extricate
himself. No mention is made of
any supporting infantry, though
it is hardly possible that batteries
would be sent so far forward

"A Berlin."
This is an extract from a letter
written by General Joubert from Lady
smith under date of October 27 to a con
tributor to the H.-rlia Gazette, In which
paper it was published In full. The other
passages, which at this Juncture will be
read with peculiar Interest, follow:
"Ever since the infamous Jameson raid
of ISM our Government was convinced
i that some disreputable characters would
urge England to war. Its meaning could
not be mistaken. It could have for Its
j sole object only the annihilation of the
I Boer republic. We were equally sure that
we would have to depend on our own
resources, for. although we knew that
this war would meet with the unanimous
condemnation of all European powers, wa
did not anticipate that any of them would
summon the strength to come to our
rescue. England's arrogance and her
strong navy have so cowed European
powers that they dare not bid her stop
in her despicable land-grabbing, not even
where their own interests arÂ«? Involved.
j Knowing this circumstance, we depended
! solely on ourselves, improved our means
of defense and tried to keep the English
in the dark as to our real preparations.
To this purpose we gave their disguised
spies access to our antiquated guns and
artillery, but were very careful to con
ceal from them our modern artillery
parks. Our calculations proved correct.
The English public credited these mln

"Your letter lays much stress on the
numerical superiority of the English, but
in my opinion the example Is a different
one. England cannot Â»end more than
85.C00 soldiers to the Transvaal without
withdrawing all her troops from the colo

but only half of them will be available.

the landing of her troops by the middle

ADAM SWEIGERT'S WILL
MAY BE CONTESTED
Heirs Assert That the Executor Has
Appropriated Funds to His
Own Use.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 15.â There promises to
be a bitter contest over the estate of
Adam Sweigert. a capitalist, who died In
San Francisco about a month ago leaving
an estate worth nearly (500,000. This was
; to be divided between his ion Jonathan,
, hi* daughter, Mis. Caroline Schmoll. and
tin- children of a deceased son, the two
1 llrst named each to receive one-third of
; the entire estate and the remaining thli 1
to be divided equally between the heirs
of the deceased son. Jonathan Swelfc-ert
was made the executor by the will, and
now it is claimed he has appropriated
some of the funds of the estate to his
own u?e.
Two weeks ago, when the petition for
probate of the will came up. it was con
tinued on behalf of the other heirs. Yes
terday it developed there was a disagree
ment between Jonathan Bwelgert and the
other devisees over the disposition of $97,
000 cash received by the testator for prop
erty at the corner of Kearny and Post
streets, San Francisco, shortly before his
death, and not Included in the will. Jona
than claimed that these funds were plated
in his hands by Adam Bwetgert In trust
for specific purposes, and the continiu*Â«ce
that was asked was in reality for the pur
pose of enabling Jonathan and the other
heirs to come to some amicable agreement
i In regard to the disposition of this money.
This had not been done >esterday, and
Judge liyland suggested that the heirs
come to some agreement over the mat
ter. Another continuance of two weeks
1 was granted.
William J. SwHgert. one of the grand
children, stated that the account rendered
by Jonathan Swelgert as to thÂ« disposi
tion of funds received from the Bale of
the Pout and Kearny street property was
unsatisfactory as to items aggregating
upward of J3<",(X"O; that among these Hems
were gifts to himself of $10,000; to his
wife, 110.000; to his son George, $5000;
to his daughter Clara, $1500: $5000
to Mrs. Schmoll and $500 to the
grandchildren. Jonathan Swelgert, he
â aid, claimed that he had carried out the
instructions of his father in these mat
ter.", while he (William J.) and other
heirs claim that the funds were not a
trust, but part of the estate, and that
. the manner of distribution was pre-
I scribed in the will. He added that $30,000
Would have to be returned to the estate
or there would be a spirited opposition
i to Jonathan's appointment as executor.
Eminent legal talent has been engaged
on both sides. Jonathan Swelgert has
secured T. C. Coogan and Snook & Church
of Oakland, and Mrs. Schmoll and the
i other heirs. Rodgers. Paterson & Slack of

a ui veritable fruit-producing and fruit
phipping empire, whose superior products
have long since outgrown local dimensions
and are now entering the markets of the
world. A broad-gauge commercial integ
rityâhonest goods. honePtly packed and
honestly labeledâ is needed to extend our
markets. As a basic principle the fruit
grower should produce only Al fruit, his
market product should be free of all
wormy, undersized, warty specimens of
windfalls and bruised specimens, and con
sist of only a prime article. The next
Step must be to study European condi
tions and practicesâ style of package,
methods of marketing and preparation to
meet the customs and practices of the
European seller and consumer. Dried
apricots, pears and peaches from the Pa
<itu- Coast dominate the markets of Con
tinental Europe. There has been some
complaint In regard to the packing and
assorting of American dried fruits and
this must be remedied.
The committee on resolutions presented
the following In regard to the recent re
ciprocity treat? entered Into with France:
Whereas, The Government of the United
States has entered Into a reciprocity conven
tion with th.- Government of France. in which
li contemplated a material reduction of duties
on Imports of French prunes, walnut! 1 , al
monds, preserved fruits, olive oil, wines, etc.;
and whereas. It U the belief of the fruit-grow
ers of the State of California assembled In
their annual meetlne: that any lessening or re
mm-al of the present tariff duties on French
prunes, nuts and wines would work a most
serious Injury to the fruit, nut and wine In
dustries of the Pacific Coast; now. therefore,
be it
Resolved. That the frult-prower* of the State
of California do most earnestly and strenuously
protect arainxt-nny and all proponed reduc
tions from existing tariff rates . n Imports of
French prunes, walnuts, almonds, preserved
fruits, olive Oil, wines, etc . and further be It
Resolved. That the honr.raMe members of the
l.'nlted States Senate are hÂ«-reby respectfully
requested to so modify the promised reciprocity
treaty between the united States and France
aa to permit the present tariff on Imports of
French fruits, nuts an.l wines to remain un-
Impaired, thus Riving to the frult-trrowers of
the Pacific Coast that measure of protection
which satisfies labor with a fair return and
lends safety to the millions of capital Invested
In their orchards. He it further
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be engrossed and that the same be sent to
Senator c,en r jte C. Perkins, through whom the I
action of the fnilt-rrower* of California In
convention nssemMed shall he mad.* known to
the State Board of Horticulture. He treat
ed of the propagation of the citron and
treatment of fruit. So far the citron con
sumed In the United States Is imported
from Europe. Most of it Is shipped to
Eastern houses and by them prepared for
mnrkrt. In this way the importers avoid
the payment of duty. This Important over
sight on the pÂ»rt of Congress should en
list the attention of California growers.
Reliable houses place the demand of th*>
United States for citron at 12.n0n cases of
2.10 pounds each. The best quality of cit- '
ron is raised In Corsica, the next best In
Greece and the poorest In Sicily. We do i
not know of any citron grown in this
country. The citron grows and fruits well
In California wherever the lemon thrive.

that such a place would be a great benefit
to the producers and to the purchasers. It
presented the following resolution, which

Resolved. That the establishment of a freÂ«

terms of the law passed for that purpose. I- a
duty Imposed not only by /legislative enactment
but by the Interests of thousands of producer*
throughout the State and of thousand* of con

Resolved. That the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners be appealed to to carry out the
provisions of the law, and If in their Judg

recommend such additional enactments as will
enable them to speedily and effectively estab

The committee on the president's ad
dress made the following report, which
was unanimously adopted:
So much of the address as relates to the
question of fruit distribution la of vital Inter
est to the growers throughout the St.it..- and
merits the most careful consideration of the
convention. Matter* have, since the address so
read, been Incidentally discussed before the
convention, and we recommend that m much
<â . the address as relates to that subject be
referred to the standing committee on mar
keting.
The question as to Insect pests and Investiga
tion touching predacious Insects* and parasites
so ably discussed In the address is one of great
Interest to the frult-growera of the State and
should rjrcelve earnest consideration and In
telligent action on the part of this convention.
The work of the State Board of Horticulture
In the suppression of Insect pruts is especially
commanded to the attention of the California
fruit-growers. Producers of do other State in
the Union or of an) other country in the world
have made the progress In the destruction of

The appropriations suggested on the part â¢â (
our State legislature (should be urged, not
only by this convention but by all local socle

Regarding tnexi adulteration, we would re

can be none more Important, be referred to tho
legislative committee to devise a plan Â»o that

PHILADELPHIA GETS
THE BIG CONVENTION
Republicans to Meet in the Quaker
City on June 19 to Name a
National Ticket,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15 -The National
; Republican Convention will convene at
! Philadelphia on Tuesday, June 19 next.
The place and date were decided upon by
: the National Republican Commit- to
day after a friendly contest for the honor
of entertaining the convention between
the city selected, Chicago. St. Louis ard
New York. The meeting of the committee
was held at the Arlington Hotel and was
presided over by Senator Hanna. the
I chairman of the committee. Forty-three
I Of the forty-rive States and each of the
i six Territories were represented. Senator
Foraker. proxy for Charles L. Kurtz, the
I national commltteeman from Ohio, and
Senator Wolcott, proxy for J. F. Saunders
of Colorado, being the only absentees. In
addition to the committee many of the
leaders of the Republican party were In
; attendance.
The proceedings throughout were enthu
j siastic and harmonious, every speech that
: was made emphasizing the fact that Prc3.
, Idem MeKinlcy would berenomlnated and
that the convention would be in effect
simply a ratification meeting.
The claims of the rival cities were pre
sented by distinguished citizens of each
In open session. The balloting occurred
in the afternoon behind closed doors.
Upon the first ballot Philadelphia received
13 votes, Chicago 20, New York 7 and St.
; Louis 9. On the second ballot the contest
narrowed down to Philadelphia and Chi
cago, the New York votes went fo Pnlla
delphla and the St. Louis vote was split
between the City of Brotherly Love and
the Windy City of the Lakes.
An amusing Incident occurred In connec
tion with this ballot. After it was con
cluded and announced a* Philadelphia 26
and Chicago 23 T. N. Jamie ton the na
tional commltteeman from Illinois, sud
denly discovered that In the excitement
be had forgotten to vote. He demanded
that the vote should he recast, and this
was accordingly done, but it ill I not
change the result. Chicago gaining only
the vote of the committe*!man from Illi
nois. Philadelphia won by the narrow
margin of only one vote.
Immediately after the announcement
the Quaker City boomers, who had been
waiting in the lobby, broke out In ringing
cheers, and th*Â» hotel was soon given up
to their jubilation. Later many of them
went to the White House and called upon
the President.
As the ballot was secret there Is no rec
ord of the city for which each committee
man voted, It was thÂ« desire of the lead
ers at the meeting to-day 'hat the conven
tion should be held on June 12. and that
date would have been selected had it not
been that It conflicted with the date of
the Rhode Island elections. June 5 was
then selected; but the date was reconsid
ered and changed to the 10th. in the hope
and belief that fore that date Congress
will have adjourned.

McKINLEY COMES
IN FOR CENSURE
Civil Service League's
Resolutions.
Special tMspetch to ThÂ» Call.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. Dec. 15.â At the
business session of the National Civil
Service League to-day all the old officers
were re-elected and resolutions, which
were In part M follows, wore adopted:
The league reKurds thÂ« order Issued by th*
President on the r.'th day of May last withdraw*
In; several thousand places from the classified
service and nullifying thÂ« rules intended to
prevent evasion of the law as the first unmU
lakable backward step taken by * Federal ad
ministration since the civil service law was
parsed. The Injurious effects of, this order hava
already been se*n In the demoralization of
many Darts of the Federal service, In the en
couragement of the enemies of reform In their
efforts to cripple the merit system and secure a
further relaxation of the rules and In the wide
spread distrust of the promise* of the Presi
dent and the party In power to enforce and
r-xv li.l the civil service law.
We also regret that the President has not jet
fulfilled the assurances given by him to a
commlttf-e of the league of his Intention to In
clude In thÂ» claÂ«t>lnÂ«-d service a much larger
number of places thin those withdrawn, but on
the contrary he ha* Included none whatever.
We venture to hope that such extensions may
be yet made at no distant day.
We ask Congress to remove the legislative
restriction ui>on the consolidation of post
offices to the end that the department may
apply the merit system to minor offices wher
ever practicable by making them branches of
larger offices and filling them from the cleri
cal force therein.
The withdrawal of fourth-class r-^stmaster
shipt from patronage would afford a most for
inM.it.l* blow at the remaining- bulwarks of the
(polls tsyotem.
The leaguo rejoices In the substantial
progress made In civil service reform In
the State of New York by the passing of
an effective reform law, and heartily
commends Governor Roosevelt for his dis
tinguished public service In aiding to re
store the merit system, which had been
seriously impaired by his predecessor Th
league expresses Its satisfaction at thÂ©
action of Governor Wolcott of Massa
chusetts In extending th*' classified serv
ice and resisting the Insidious attempt
made to cripple the merit system In that
State, and declares:
We confidently rely on public opinion to pro
mote the extension of the merit system to all
brauchea of our national. State and municipal

HAWAIIAN RACE IS
FASTJJISAPPEARING
HONOLULU, Dec The number of
deaths in this city during eleven months of
this year Is an Increase of 40 per cent over
the number during the year when cholera
visited the Islands and an Increase of no
less than bO per cent over the figures for
the year following, which was Just after
the city Lad been given a thorough clean
ing. Statistics show that the principal in
crease Is among the native Htwalians
and the Japanese. As there are no recent
census figures upon which to compute a
death rate It Is Impossible to compare
death rates, but physicians think that the
growth Of population Is not enough to ac
count for the Increase In deaths. " The na
tive population is decreasing, yet there
will be 626 deaths during !899 if the rate
keeps up, while In no year since 18*9 has
there been more than 461. This reems to
confirm the Idea that the natives are dy

Payne Resolution Abandoned.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â The Payne
resolution for the reapportlonment of del
egates to the National Republican Con
vention on the basis of the Republican
vote cast In the States and Territories will
not be pressed at thi9 meeting of the Na
tional Committee.
Up to last night Mr. Payne had fully In
tended to offer the resolution to-morrow
and to urge Its adoption, but after a con
ference with the President at the WhltÂ«
House to-night, nt which Secretary Dick
and Governor Nash of Ohio were present,
he decided to abandon the effort to have
It acted on at this met ting Much oppo
sition had developed to the proposed
change, and the conclusion was reached
that it was inexpedient to push the mat
ter at this time.
does not nhcw such a state of affairs
According to the fig', for eleven
months there will he tifry-six dearhs
among whites during this year. La.* 1 year
there were seventy-seven and in sevctal
previous years the figures have gone over
thirty, while the population has undoubt
edly grown very much. From these fig
ures it appears that the whites are do'.nff
better In Honolulu as regards health than
either natives. Japanese. Chinese or Por
tuguese. The manner of living may have
something to do with this, and an ai;!Â»;i

WHEELER AND BERRY CLASH
GOVERNORSHIP FIGHT BOBS UP
IN CONGRESS.
Goebelite and Anti-Goebelite Take
Occasion to Denounce Each Other
During the Financial
Debate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec, 13.â closing
day of the general debate on the financial
bill proved to be one of exceptional inter
est. At the outset a â harp personal col
loquy occurred between Representative*
Wheeler and Berry, of Kentucky, both
Democrats, over tha. recent Kentucky
election and the charges growing out of
it. Wheeler secured recognition to ques
tion statements made by lierry yesterday
as to corruption in the recent Kentucky
campaign.
"1 regret the necessity of having to
â  wash our dirty linen of Kentucky on the
Boor of the Mouse,' said Wheeler, "but I
do not propose that our people shall be
maligned and slandered without a. word
of protest. '
Berry Â»at a few seats ahead of Wheeler
and the latter addressed himself person*
ally to his colleague. Wheeler declared
that Berry iepresented neither Kentucky
nor her people and that the people of his
district woiiitl speedily rebuke him by re
tiring him to private life. The election of
Taylor he asserted, had been bought and
paid lor. with .1 railroad on one side and
the plain people on the other. Hut
despite this, he said, Governor Goebel
would yet We seated.
"Yes. I use the word advisedly," pro
ceeded \V heeler, referring to his character
ization Ot Goebel as Qo\ ernor, "for before
the bud* burst <â !) any tree In Kentucky
be will be Us chief executive and he will
have routed that nefarious guns who won
their certificate of election i>y corruption,
timid and rascality."
Wheeler closed by declaring emphatic
ally that Taylor had not been elected,
th.it he had secured by Irregular methods
a certificate of election; but when the
calcium light of the courts was turned
on this proceeding li would be William
Qoebel who would be seated In the execu
tive chair.
(â .ii.in.-l H<-rry was quickly on his feet
as Wheeler closed and responded savage
ly, personally and with much feeling He
said the speech just heard was typical of
the Intolerance of thai Kentucky element
which did not brÂ«*ok any freedom of opin
ion, He did not need the Influence of the
gentleman or his backers. Four times
he had been sent here and he would re
turn again. Shaking his linger at Wheeler
Berry exclaimed: "You are cringing at
the feet of Goebel, and 1 tell you that
your scalp â¢- taken now by Qoebel."
Whm reference was made to the irreg
ularity of :he Louisville convention
Wheeler sought to Intel nipt, l"it Berry
waved him off. declaring thai the gentle
man had participated in the disorder and
had stood up and yelled down op|>ositton
with policemen about him.
Wheeler interjected H flat contradiction
of this but. not heeding Interruptions,
Colonel' Berry proceeded In hi liery re
sponse, declining that Wheeler was as
bad as Goebel himself.
Wheeler gained a minute to rep de
fending the regularity of the Ixjuitnille.
convention and saying that only a few
thugs and ti.uKhs were excluded. The
tension over the affair was relieved at
this point by a point of order from Kep
resentative Cox of Tennessee.
"What Is the point of order? asked the
chairman. ' 'â '.'â  . â  â 
â¢I object to having this Kentucky side
show thrust into a tinunclul debate." said
Cox gravely, to the education of the He
publican side. This caused a laugh and
he heal of the exchange between the two
Kentucky gentlemen was dispelled.
Broslus of I'ennsylvanla spoke in favor
of the bill. BroaluH declared that no
Date in American history would shine
with greater splendor through the cen
turies than that Which tells how this ii:t
ii. hi preserved Its honor, maintained its
credit and kept its money good.
(â¢iv..ii. i of Tennessee spoke against the
I.HI Williams of Mississippi arraigned the
Republican side for inconsistency, and
urged that it was possible by legislative
enactment to maintain a ratio between
the metals Boerlnj? of Kentucky denied
that the election of Taylor In Kentucky
\v;is due to fraud, and said the strongest
refutation of i he charge was the fact that
the election was held under the Ooebel
law framed by the Democratic candidate.
" Bailey of Texas received dose attention
from both sides when he sj>oke. He said
a remarkable spectacle was presented by
the debate on this bill. He recalled that
when In the Fifty-fourth Congress Towne
asserted that the Republican party had
never declared tor the gold standard, the
Congressional Record showed that he was
Interrupted by man} Republicans with the
exclamation:
â â¢And It never will.
Bailey said the Republican â¢- was bo
busy studying the trend of events that it
had not time to study the science of
â  money While the first section of this
' bill purports to establish the gold stand
! ard the law of 1875 fixed the gold dollar
! -is the unit of value. This bill was. there
fore simply a re-enactment i"M forward
; to make people believe something new and
i wise was being done.
I Immediately following Bailey <- m.> the
I statement of Scudder (Dem.) of New
â¢â¢As - Democrat I favor the single gold

A TACOMA MAN'S
HORRIBLE CRIME
Adam Crist Kills His Wife and
One Son and Wounds
a Second Child.
TACOMA. Dec 15.â Adam Crist to-day deliberately shot % his wife fata My.
killed his *-year-old son, seriously wounded a second son â â *â¢ <1 3 years, :i id
then ended the tragedy by putting a bullet through his own brain. Jeal
ousy is the only motive assigned for the crime.
Crist was the proprietor of the Chicago lodglng-hous?. ll' returned
this morning from a six month"' business trip to Spokane and wan at the hotel
during the forenoon, apparently in 'lie best of health and spirits. At 2 o'clock In
the afternoon he went to a Pacific avenue pawnbroker and purchased two revol
vers. He stopped a few doors away .it a drugstore and bought 23 cents" worth of
vitriol, lie must have proceeded directly home, for the shooting occurred only
a few minutes later.
Crist was In the kitchen of the lotel, on the second floor. wtMB hi* wife â¢vas
called ;o th*- head of the stairs to talk to a peddler. After an Interval of a few
minute? be sent the younger child to ask her to come to the kitchen. Immedl-Ue
|y afterw.ird four shots were tired, all of which were found to have taken effect
In her body. Crist then turned the revolver on the little boy and wounded him in
the leg, but the child managed to crawl down the stairs and escape. The woman
staggered to the sidewalk and Crist went Into the hall, where he caught the
8-year-old boy. There are no wltneases to this part of the tragedy, but from the
position of the body he must have held the lad close to him while he put a bul
let through bis heart.
A .:â¢Â»-â¢ allt.er bullet through his own head followed and both bodies fell to thÂ«
floor, still clasped in each other's arms.
MARIN INVADED
BY PANTHERS
Party Organized to Kill
the Animals.
Fiwlal Dlxpatch to Th* Call.
TIBITRON. Dec. 15.â Two large speci
m. us of the ferocious panther tribe which
have been responsible of late tor numer
ous depredations In the northern part of
Marin Countyâ not even stopping at mak
ing attacks on human beings, as wit
nessed In a recent Incident near Camp
Taylor have visited the southern part of
the county, and for ten days have kept
the residents of the mountain region
around here and Xl Campo In â  state of
terror. A number of old hunters tried to
hunt the dangerous beasts down yester
day and again this morning, but without
any success.
For several days a number of dairymen
leasing portions of the Lyford ranch have
been annoyed by finding calves killed and
partly eaten, footprints in the vicinity
â bowing the work to be that of California
lions, as they ure commonly called. Last
Monday J. Jucobson saw one of the beasts
in the "hills above Xi Campo, and hastily
beat a retreat, as he had no weapon but
a shotgun loaded with buckshot. On the
following day Henry Mersey perceived
the two panther*, a male and a female,
together back ot Hlfarlta station. Consid
erable alarm was manifested by the more
timid residents at these discoveries, but
affairs reached a focus yesterday, when v
Portuguese dairyman witnessed the kill-
Ing of a tine call and could do nothing to
prevent it. He came to town and reported
his loss, whereupon a posse sallied forth,
but found when they reached the spot
that both beasts had disappeared 'after
eating a good part of the slaughtered ani
mal
Next Sunday Albert Smith, "boss"
painter of the Donahue line, will head a
party that mean.-* to trail the two danger
ous panthers to their lair by means of
rleerhounds and there make short work of
them. Those who will go with Smith are:
C Almv. George Donahue. J. Jacobson,
Henry Hersey and George Oollomore.
Coyotes have also been numerous In this
region of late, and as many as five have
been >â â¢â¢< n In a pack. Their depredations
have so far been confined to poultry.

] To offset this Turner caught Parker
with a left on the head. In the next
moment Turner landed onÂ© of the most
t-ftVctive blows of the fight. He caught
1 Purktr flush on the face as the Denver
â  boxer came toward him and again had

at Parker, fhowerlr.g blows on him. but
i could not reach a vulnerable point. The

the gong sounds. The spectators were
all on th-lr feet, yelling Mko madmen. The
boxers did not l.Â«-ar the slgT.aJ that the
round had ended and had to be dragged
to their corners by their seconds.
In the third round Parker began tr.<Â»
tactics which won him the fight. He

An Alaskan hut is not tho worst place

Fists of a Mjuare Moor of earth flanked on
all sides by two wide ledges rising one
I above the other like- a terrace. On the low
er one rest the cooking, weaving and fish
ing utensils, the knives and needles, pots
and pans. On the upper ledge, with much
display of wonderfully woven . blankets,
ure the beds. In the centtr of the room
glows the lire, the smoke groping its way
out of a hole In the rojf. After the days
work is done and the stomachs of both
! people and dogs are full the family gath

the father, next to him the mother; on
one hanu the sons, and on the other tho
! daughters, even to the third and fourth
generations. It may be. lU-yond these are
the servants or p laves. Each has his place
| and takes it as a matter of course. With
out, in the darkness, the dogs clutter
I about the door and howl. The mysterious

I The snow-capped mountains, with their
! Illimitable glaciers, lie Just beyond. The

sUange that, amid Fcent-s so "wild and
ftarful. superstitions, also wild and fear
ful, spring Into existence? Or can one be
surprised that in an unlettered country
the story tellers are of mighty power, and
toll tal-s that affright the "children till
they scramble to the safe shelter of their
mothers arms? When the family sings
In strunge. broken, yet rhythmical meas
ures, the dogs howl louder than before,
and tho women sway their squat 1....;i>s
back and forth unceasingly, keeping their
hands occupied meanwhile at their ta--ks
of weaving or braiding. Ihe men carve
their spoons or cut curious figures from
i the black i-late. Th- suitor for the hand
of one of the daughter* enters slyly and
takes a seat with the sons. No "protest
Is made. The father and mother go on
with their little tasks, tho voting girls
giggle after the fashion of girls the world
over. And the suitor, thus unrepulsed
contents himself, thinking hi* case won.
The oldest among them chants some old
folk song, and the father rises. It is the
signal for good-nights. The ashes are

Three Wives in One Picture.
Copley, the irtlst and father of the
future Lord Lyndhurrt, once had a
singular exiH>riÂ«nc*Â». A rich citizen of
Rrlstol who had married a second
wife, instructed him to paint a fam
ily group of himself, wife and their seven
1 children. ' When Jt was done the gentle
man remarked that it wanted one thing
more, and that was a portrait of his first
wife. "But." said the artist, "she is dead
you know. What can I do? ShÂ« can only
be admits] as an angel." "Not at all,
said the other, "she must come in as a
woman; no â  â â¢â¢1* for me." So the tlrst
wife was added to the group. While
however, the picture remained In the
studio, the citizen returned one day with
a strange woman on his arm. "I must
have ati"; cast of your hand. Mr. Cop
ley." said he "An an i.lent befell my sec
ond wife; this Is my third, and she Is come
to have her likeness included in the
group." The painter compiled, and all
three spouses appeared In the picture.â

PARKER JABS TURNER UNTIL THE LATTER IS DEFEATED.
Parker's strength was waning and he
could not take advantage of his oppo
ner.t'B weakness. Turner went down
again falling on his back in Parker cor
ner. He apparently wanted to stay down,
but the cries of the spectators had the
effect of making him Mand up.
Parker continued jabbing with his left
hjvnd. and whenever Turner could do so he
clinched to avoid punishment. Parker
threw all his weight on Turner when he
had an opportunity. Turner was on the
floor when tie gong signaled the end of

seconds and of the spectators urged him
to continue, and ho lasted out the round.
The end came in the ninth. Purker beat
a tattoo on Turner's bcnly nd Turner
suddenly went down, clutching his side
after the fashion set by Richie In the pre
liminary bout. He whs counted out rap

The Obelisk in Danger.
one of the chief attractions of Central
Park, In the Cltv of New York, Is the
Egyptian obelisk erected opposite the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. This an
cltnt monolith was erected in Central
Park in ISM. having been transported
from Alexandria, under charge of Lieu
tenant Commander Qorringe. It was as
serted that the severity of our climate
would cause (integration, and steps were
taken to prevent this, or to reduce it to
a minimum. A careful examination made
recently proves that in spite of the care
takÂ»:n to prevent It the process of disin
tegration lias been going on. The rav
ages of th<> weather arÂ« particularly no
tlceuble on the wept face of the obelisk,
which has a scaly appearance In certain
places. This la the side upon which the
shaft rested when partly burled In the
s.inds of Egypt, and the hleroejljrpl on
11 are much fainter than on the other
three surfaces. Then, the crack which
extends from the base to the south side
of the obelisk has been gradually spread
ing, although It was rtlled with a wooden
plug covered with cement when Uk
stone was erected on Its present site.
The authorities who have chance of the
obelisk will make a thorough investiga
tion, and if it can bo shown that the
monument is in danger of destruction by
being exposed to the Inclement elements
It will probably bo removed and exhib
ited una cover.

his groin mutely indicating that he had
received a foul blow. Referee Jordan
waited until he stood up and th<en decided
the bout In his favor, allowing the claim
of foul. Richie' seconds led Mm to his
corner, where he continued to give out
ward signs of pain.
The spectators wen In doubt as to the
extent of Richie's Injury and many of
them raised the cry of "fake." After a
few moments the injured boxer walked
out of the ring unaided. ThÂ»; blow, as
described by Cole and persons in his cor
ner, was â  fair one. He had been getting
some punishment in his own corner and
In a breakaway landed a left swing on
the head. He followed this Instantly with
a straight r:^;;t on the body; which land
ed Just at the top of Richie s trunks. This
was well above the danger line.
Cole's showing waa disappointing. It is
explained by his friends a> being due to
illness. He is said to have trained nt a
disadvantage and his work showed he was
not in his old-time form. i!- was slow,
his Judgment of distance was bad and
he had no defense which his opponent
could not get Inside of. Richie was the
aggressor and had much the best of the
first round. Cole tr!M several swings in
the second but mIFsM and took some stiff
jabs in return. The sudden rndlng of
the bout early in the second r â¢ml proved
a disappointment. On th*> showing made
up to that time Richie would have won

Education of Japanese Women.
Under the auspices of the economic and
reform section of the Society for Ethical
Culture, addresses upon "The Social Con
dition and Education of Women in Japan"
were recently delivered before a large au
dience. Inazo Kitrobe, I'h. D.. professor
of economics In the Imperial College at
riapporo. rave a historic resume of the
condition of Japanese women, and said
their present Inferiority Is due to the feud
alism existing In his country for the last
.00 years. Japan received its beginnings
In literature from China and its Buddhism
from India, and both of these forces also
had an indirect influence in lowering the
status of women.
Ohson H. Sakurai. Registrar of the Melji
Girls* Semiary at Toklo, and Miss Anna
C. HartÃhorno. who spent three years in
Japan, said that general interest In educa
tion is Increasing, and it is only a matter
of time before privately endowed schools
for women will be a part of Japan's edu
cational system. The Mei.li Seminary',
which is the only private non-sectarian
girls' school in Japan, was established In
IV.'. but lost all Its buildings and appar
atus by fire three years ago. Over I*oo
girls have received the benefit of Its train
ing, but, owing to financial needs and the
CLARHNCE RICHIE.

lack of a permanent fund, only sixty are
now in attendance.
The Japanese Government began to take
an interest in co-education twenty yt-irs
ago. when several young women were
sent abroad for study, and at the present
time there are ten Japanese girls studying
In the United States. The outlook for the
future was said to be a promising one if
the proper interest and encouragement
are given from countries more advanced
in culture and enlightenment.â Philadel

so little of the youngster's class that lv

Dlomed, which had receded from 7 to 10

riving early pr : ... â¢ of winning In rag
time. Henry gradually moved up from
fifth position with his mount and catching
Dionied when his breathing apparatus
showed signs of Impairment, beat him oat
a scant length at the wire. The winner
ran practically unbacked, and his victory
was welcomed by the books. Mountebank,
with Burns up, backed from S to 5 to even
money favoritism, ran unplaced.
Cold, rainy weather and a card which
did not look particularly enticing., at

The seven turlong handicap proved only

CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL'S FAR-FAMED FOOTBALL TEAM.
FOOTBALL enthusiasts are of the opinion that the forth
coming contest on th.- gridiron Held, between the Univer
sity of California eleven and thai from tho Carlisle 'I'a.i
Indian Bchool, will be the most sensational In all the history
of the game on this coast. Tin- Indians have met tl

CALIFORNIA'S MEN
PREPARING FOR
THE INDIAN TEAM
Most Sensational Game In the History
of the Sport Is Expectea When
the Elevens M^et.
After weeks of negotiation, first with
the Chicago University and then with rep
resentatives of the <"a.rlislc- Indians, a
bolidaj game has at last L>Â« on arranged
definitely with the latti-r loutbaii team.

â  ttes .1 gi iiÂ»-rai attention to all football
tave reached v:< general conclusion
that even a team <>f the ralltHW ihown i>y
iiit j! 111. i eleven In the Thanksglv
urn game, when 1 Stanford w.i^ def< ated by
ore of 3u to o, cannot nope to prove
victorious in a contest with the sensa
tional Indian football U-am Still tht-re
are many who hoia v contrary opinion,
and thej are of im-. t.fiutf that Urn

Ki"ry in th. gridiron struyKie between

California has certainly played a fine
quality of football during toe entire sea
son and is entitled to a game with the
Eastern whirlwind team, itegret is heard
on wary side that the University of Chi
ciago eleven was not secured for the holi
day game, .is in.th that team and the blue
and gold aggregation are similar In re
gard to their style of -play* and general
make-up. The Indians have played the
biggest teams', in the country except
Princeton and have met with a meed of
success in all their engagements.
Heavy, grinding worK is what the In
dians map out lor themselves In every
game. They know little, of the tine points
of the game, that is from the strategic
point of view. If they did, according to
the foremost critic ot tootball In America,
there would not be a team In the country
that could defeat them. In straight foot
ball they have no superiors, and they play
with a fierceness cnaraeteristic of their
race. The style of game most effective
against them is the tricky, .new-formation
kind. On line play they are strong,
strength and long training having
wrought a bulwark of defense in this par
ticular.
With this end in view California will
perfect all its tricks, devoting most of the
time to the practice of plays that were
not used against Stanford or the Olympic
teams this season. As a master of trick
football Cochran has no equal, and he la
ably seconded by Kelly. Both men are
saturated with the crafty play thai has
characterized Princeton, and the training
work for the next two weekÃ will be well
worth the watching.
Tills lighter team of California, with
backs fleet as the wind, and a team that
has handled itself in fine fashion all sea
son, opposed to â  swarthy, muscular and
strong set of aborigines, will certainly
present a football spectacle new to this
coast. The Indians play marvelous,
straight football, and they come almost
up to the Harvard team in weight, tho
heaviest eleven In the country. The only
hope for California thus is in Its quick
backs playing trick football.
California's eleven began training yes
tesday. Since Thanksgiving the men have
Indulged themselves, forgetting nil about
training restrictions and dietary bans.
The two weeks' rest will not necessarily
be ruinous to their condition. Had the
season lasted another week the blue and
gold eleven would have been stale beyond
a doubt. With two weeks of active train-
Ing the eleven should be In strong lighting
trim. For six days before the game the
Indians* will have no opportunity for
training, due to the trip across the conti
nent. They will not suffer seriously on this
account, as tlyy are always in prime
physical shape.
The blue and gold eleven that will line
up against the Indians will be the same
as the Thanksgiving team, with two ex
ceptions â Captain Whlpple and Hill, left
end. Clay will be found in Wnlpplo's
place and Masters in that of Hill. This
will weaken the team to some extent.
Christmas day has been set for the
game, but this may be altered. It Is sug
gested that a game on New Year's day
would be more fruitful from a financial
point of view.
The price of admission will be $150 and
$1. and the game will he played at Six
teenth and Folsom street grounds, the
stands that were erected for the Thanks
giving game not having been disturbed
The public will get a chance this time to
secure the best s<-Hts. as the usual reser
vations by the colleges and University
Club will not be made. : ;. â 
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
If the ground is in such condition that
play Is possible, there will be an associa
tion football match to-day on the Presidio
athletic ground, between tho Vampires
and a fan of British apprentices, cap
tained by the Rev. H. W. 1. O'Rourke,
one of the chaplains of the Seamen's In
stitute. The Vampires have not played
together since their visit to Shasta Coun
ty on Thanksgiving day. where the Res

game. The Vampire team will be chosen
from the following: J. McGaw (captain).

the newly formed poods, rinding in them
some feed which the <>id ponds do not
afford. With the northÂ« m birds here me
gunmen look for good sport from this
time forward whenever â booting condi

week may have scattered the birds over a
large territory, but they arc at least
within the district over which the city
sportsmen shoot.

FACULTY AT STANFORD
ABOLISHES BASKET-BALL

STANFORD INIVKUSITV. Dec. 15 â
The faculty athletic committee at a meet

which rvquir.-s team work, and further
provides that all contests must bo played

that the same of tennis should come with

THE STRfIW EOND EVIL.
T Thomas A. Kelly, former

a straw bond upon which 1

ry and corruption.
The manufacture of straw bonds has been a Police
Court industry with which the authorities have tem
porized and trifled for many years. Grand juries
have investigated numerous scandals having straw
bonds for their objective, the police have protested
publicly and privately against the acceptance of such
sureties, and the Supervisors have occasionally
:i<]o]ited measures to restrain the evil; but the case
fixers, the clerks of the Police Court and the political
bosses have continued to divide the proceeds of the
business without practically any more serious inter
ierence than an occasional new>-paper exposure.
Every time a new Board of Supervisors has been in
ducted into office the members have been warned
anair.st appointing as Police Court clerks persons ad
dicted to tht habit of accepting straw bonds. But in
most cases the warn ings have Rone unheeded. Year
after year a class of men have sought and obtained
these places whose only purpose has been to use therf

TELL THE TRUTH-
SENATOR CHANDLER has not done well in
moving to table the Pettigrew resolution, and
the Senate did worse in adopting the motion.
The resolution asked for information, for the use of
Congress, upon the extent to which the Filipino gov
ernment, organized by a proclamation written by
Consul General Wildman. had been recognized by
the army and navy of the United States. This in
quiry is amply justified by the official statements of
â¢:an -now in his reports in the State Uepart
nciit. and by the more recent testimony concerning
the action of our naval authority in the affair at
In his public addresses and in his message the
ent has left the disposition of the Philippines in
the hands of Congress. That body represents directly
the people and the States. It is influenced by public
opinion, aii'l that should be based upon full knowl
edge of all the facts. The people of the country wish
to be just. With the facts before them they will de
vhat is just We can rise superior to any na
tional misfortune. In the course of our history this
country has been invaded; its Capitol has been
burned; its soil has been desecrated; the union of its
a has been dissolved and re-formed; its Presi
dents have been murdered, and it has survived it all
and emerged from misfortune stronger by reason of
the difficulties it has mastered. But it has never been
guilty of injustice and dishonor, and will not be un
less intrigue and deception lead the instincts of the
people astray.
itor Chandler has not explained how Congress
can act intelligently in the grave matter referred to
i* by the President unless all the facts are before it.
The summary suppression of thi? resolution of in-
quiry j'.ams and locks the door upon all the facts
which are material. The same Senate, when it rati
fied the treaty of Paris, qualified that act by its reso
â  disclaiming any intention of our Government
â¢rmanently annex the Philippines. Whether that
disclaimer were wise or otherwise it was the solemn
act of the treaty-making branch of Congress. It is
known that without that qualification the treaty could
not have been ratified. This disclaimer was made in
view of the disclosures of Wildman's official reports
and the reports of our army and navy officers. The
suppression of this inquiry into further facts in the
line will be taken by the country as a confession
â¢ â  these facts exi>t. It would be taken as an ad
mission that action under Pettigrew's resolution
would disclose the formation of a Philippine govern
ment under Wildman's proclamation, the exercise by
it of all the powers of government, civil and military,
including the 1 I - jht of nationality in the parole
of prisoners of war. and that it had a flag and an
army to follow it and a fleet that sailed under it.
NÂ« I Mowing these is the admission that
the four islands were surrendered by Spain to that
government, with the exception of a small strip of
territory around Manila Bay and the city of Manila.
It prill be seen, therefore, that suppression of the in
makes no part of the situation any easier for
â¢ in authority, bin rather tends to increase their
difficulties. The people of this country- are not chil
dren, to be chidden for asking questions. They are
the final z- .nd have a right to know the rei
son for all thing 9 done by their Government. They
are not going to be frightened by any disclosures.
They are not afraid of the dark and surely do not
shrink from the light.
We regard it a? extremely unfortunate that the
Senate refuses to Â«eek the facts. Admiral Dewcv
talks about shooting Aguinaldo when we catch him.
We can do that. Spain <hot Rizal. The Filipinos
are giving us a guerrilla fight, as they did Spain, and
it is proposed that when we take prisoners we shall
execute them as Spain did. But then things are not
me way as by Spain. The
Spanish Government is not republican. The people
had no responsibility in the slaughter of Ri.-al and
the wholesale butchery of guerrillas in the plaza of
Cavitr. Rut when we imitate those thing* it is the

AMERICAN EXHIBITS AT PARIS.
PVENJAMIN D. WOODWARD. Qnited States
Commissioner to the Paris Exposition, gave in
the course of a short interview just before his
recent return to Paris a good deal of interesting in
concendng the prospects of the American
exhibit there. It appears from his statement that we
will surpass the world in the departments of machin-
I engineering, and yet we will not be able
to make complete display of our work in those lines.
The reasons why we shall fall. short of showing all
we can do or have done is curious. In the first place
the prosperity of the country and the activity of in
dustry have constituted a handicap in an unexpected
way. Many of our manufacturers have actually been
so rushed by the work of filling orders they could
not prepare exhibits. Mr. Woodward is quoted is
saying: "All American industries are crowded to the
utmost extent. In many cases manufacturers are
working night and day to fill orders. It is difficult
to get materials. Many exhibitors who took space
and desired to exhibit find it impossible to use it.
They cannot get ready. There will be no carriage
exhibit, for instance. It has always been in other
exhibitions an important exhibit, and the manufac
turers were very anxious to get space, but when they
Start building a vehicle for the exposition it is sold
before it receives the first coat of paint. A customer
comes in and finds it to be just what he wants, and
immediately he demands it. I have finally had to give
up the idea, of settings-carriage exhibit.''
Another obstacle in the way of obtaining exhibits
has been the rapid absorption of manufacturing plants
by trusts. By reason of these movements toward
larger organizations individual manufacturers or ex
isting manufacturing companies stop all their plans
for making exhibits, and the trust organizations are
not effected in time to undertake them. We have
thus the curious paradox that we shall make an in
complete industrial display at the expositi6n because
of the very activity of our industry and the magni
tude of its enterprises.
In commenting upon the State displays Mr. Wood
ward Riven the first place to New York hy reason of
the magnificent exhibit it will make of engine
work. Of our own commonwealth he uys: â¢ I Tho
State of California has prepared at great expense a
large relief map of the State; also maps and models
of the largest engineering work on the railroads of
the State, and of long-distance electrical transmission,
which is an important thing. California's appropria
tion is being expended very judiciously. They are
doing exactly what we wanted them to do."
Finally it may be noted the Commissioner is san
guine the exposition will be thoroughly ready for the
opening day. "We shall make it a matter of pride,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT/L, SATURDAY. DECEMIVKK I<>, 1899.
he said, "to be ready on time, and the French and
others will do likewise. Our first material was
shipped on the Prairieâ a Government transport. We
have completed all the contracts for all of our four
annex buildings to be finished on the first of Janu
ary or February. They will be devoted to agricul
ture, liberal arts, marine and forestry."
Thus it appears that while our display will not be
a comprehensive one showing all we can do, it
will still be one that will astonish foreigners, and in'
most respects at any rate witf be in good shape when
the first visitors see it. Our Government has not
voted so much money for the exposition as other
great nations, but private enterprise has made up the
deficiency, and Americans at the great world competi
tion that closes the century will have well founded
reasons for pride in the work of their countrymen.
LIEUTENANT N I BLACK of the navy, after
six months' service in the Philippines, has de
termined upon a complete reversal of our
policy toward Chinese labor. He says: 'The Chi
nese, of all the Asiatics, are individually the most
trustworthy, commercially the only honest, and as
employes the only faithful people who are at hand
as the true instruments to use in making these islands
a veritable treasure trove. To restrict them in any
way will be a political blunder and commercial sui
cide."
It is announced that Admiral Dewey is in thorough
sympathy with this view. The other members of the
Philippine Commission are not as marked in their ap
proval. We have no doubt that, as an economic
proposition, Niblack states the truth. He is backed
by the fact that no tropical country has ever im
pressed the world's commerce with its surplus pro
duction without using some form of servile and do
cile labor. White men cannot work in the Philip
pines, and it is proved that the natives will not work
beyond supplying their simple .necessities. Our
dream of wealth, therefore, is to be realized by the
exploitation of cheap coolie labor from China. This
labor is to produce such a surplus of hemp, sugar and
t< k-ieco as to make the islands a treasure trove. We
are told that between them and the United States
commercial intercourse is to be free. No pretense Is
made that coolie wages in the islands can be raised
to the American white standard. If it were pretended
no one in California would believe. Out of an
abundant experience we have learned that Chinese
coolie labor here, instead of going upon the white
standard, established here the coolie standard for
white labor, and for that reason we demanded the ex
clusion of Chinese. But why exclude them here if
they are to be commoners under our flag in the Phil
ippines? From there they can continue a still more
dangerous competition with the American white
wage-worker. They can really make the islands a
treasure trove for the few who have the capital to
exploit cheap labor, but the white labor of this coun
try will be more vitally smitten than ever.
It is a settled element in the protective policy that
to admit free to our markets the products of servile
labor which compete with the products of white labor
| here is the equivalent of domesticating servile labor in
| this country to compete with white labor face to face.
; We call these matters to public attention now.
i Others say this country will cross that bridge when it
comes to it. The same men will say, when the bridge
is reached, that it is manifest destiny; the flag will
be waved and white labor will get a stunning blow in
the name of Fate and Patriotism.
WHEN* reviewing a few days ago the recom
mendationj of the Postmaster General The
â¢ued out that his plan of petting rid of
the deficit in the postal revenues by restricting the
amount of matter carried as second class mail would
have the immediate effect of reviving the cry for a
reduction in the rates paid to railways. It is con
i by impartial rtndentl of the subject that either
of the proposed remedies would be sufficient for the
evil, but up to this time it has never been possible to
get a majority in both houses of Congress to decide
which one to take.
. There i^ do reason why both remedies should not
be applied. The abuses of second class mail privilege
should he checked, and st the same time the exces
sive payments to the railroads should be stopped.
By that process the postoftice would not only be rid
of its annual deficit but would have each year a hand
some surplus to turn into the treasury or to be ap
plied to postal improvements of one kind or another.
It never seems to occur to anybody in Congress,
however, that both economies might be practiced!
and consequently the advocates of each are just about
strong enough to defeat the advocates of the other
whenever that other gets a bill before the House.
In the last Congress the action of the House on
the subject was a farce. When a bill to put an end
to the second class mail abuses was to be voted on
a majority of the members, without regard to party.
i 1 they would never restrict second class mail
privileges so long as the greater evil of railroad ex
tortions was permitted, so they voted against that
bill. A little later, when a bill to reduce the postal
payments to railways was under consideration, a
majority vowed they would never impair the effi
ciency of our railway mail service by a false economy
so long as frauds were tolerated in the second class
mails. So nothing was done. Every Congressman,
however, had made a record which he could show
to his constituents to prove that he had endeavored
to put an end to extravagance or fraud in postoffice.
affairs.
The Postmaster General has given his indorsement
to the proposed restrictions upon second class mail
privileges, and now comes a representative of the
National Board of Trade and urges in place of that
plan a reduction of railway payments. TTr i* reported
as saying oo per cent of the mail is carried in railway
mail-cars, the railroads receiving an average of $.75,049
annually for each of the 021 cars allotted to this work,
whereas for passenger cars the receipts amount to
only $10,528. He advocated a horizontal reduction of
25 per cent in rates paid railroads for carrying the
mails, and charged the Postoffice Department with
discriminating in the interests of the railroads. He
expressed the opinion that a cheap parcels post could
not be secured until this ceased.
The statement that we cannot expect a cheap par
cels post until railroad mail rates are reduced is sig
nificant. It is known the express companies are
fighting against the establishment of a parcels post.
The railroads will of course fight any attempt to re
duce their revenues from the postoffice. The two
forces will, naturally combine, and as a consequence
postal reform at this session is hardly to be looked
for. It will take a long fight to overcome an oppcv
1 sition of that kind.
Patriotism seems to be in disfavor at the mtional
capital. The House nf Representatives has declined
to he represented officially at the unveiling of a
statue of Daniel Webster which has been erected in
Washington.

THE German four-masted bark Theodor has hrul an eventful career. In 1562, she was launched from the yards of
R. Napier & Sons. Glasgow, and In her time was one of the fastest steamers running between Liverpool and New
York. Faster craft were built, however, and tho steamer was relegated to the second class. Boon the was not
Ijood enough for that, so her machinery was taken out and the was christened the China. Later she* became
the Magallar.es and that name can still be traced on her bow, although it is partially covered by her present name
Theodor. On her voyage here from London the Theodor was 232 days on the passage. She was partially dismasted off
the Horn and had to put Into Honolulu for repairs. The vessel was twentydays coming' here from the Islands.
MORE BIG REALTY DEALS.
BUSINESS has been good In real
estate circles during the past
week, notwithstanding tho fact
that we are on the verge of the
holiday seasiÂ»n, when all property
transfer* are supposed to be more or less
neglected. The fact that south of Mar
ket street property is sti.l in great de
mand received further jiroof in the t>:Ue

l.'t near the water front for 554.000. The
property has a frontage of eighty feet,
and the pufcoaser contemplates the erec
tion of a line building on that and the ad-
Joining site. No further details or de
scription of the property are yet obtain
able.-

44 THE FR AW 'LEYS"
AGAIN ON DECK
mR. FRAWLEY has withdrawn
yMV, "ThÂ« Fatal Card." a title tlrnt
li Ih v* came near having a double sig
nificance, and has called a new
deal with a revival of "The Sporting
Duchess." The latter Is a far better play,
however you may look- at It. although a
certain tone that It seems to have In the
first act Â»Â«â¢ very materially lowered by the
clots of melodrama that follow. In his
last dramatic experimentâ ln his present
selection' of plays and peopleâ Mr. Fraw
ley is treading close to the danger line of
tolerance. He has allowed too slight a
margin of safety, and it is his own fault
if the more discriminating element of his
onco enviable clientele has deserted him.
Frawley's name was one to conjure with
In the past, when he gave- us Blanche
Hates and Frank Worthing, but ho should
not count too much upon the things that
he ha." done and try to cajole the public
Into believing that the Frawley company
must necessarily be a great organization
by virtue merely of its title. The man
ager of a theatrical company cannot rest
on his record and hope to succeed with
indifferent wares, which Is a lesson that I
think Mr. Frawley Is taking to heart
about this time.
There are possibilities In the company
as It Ik- there is promise of better plays
In the future, and personally I wish Mr
Frawlry good luck In his enterprise; but
the necessity of rending htm a lecture la
not the less on his present showing.
"The Snorting Duchess" Ib a play of
modern Kngllsh life in which the arts of
Intrigue are dexterously employed and the
vices of society exposed in an amazingly
outspoken manner. There Is never a
veiled allusion, but rather a boldness of
speech that Is absolutely unnatural In Its
crudeness. Th<>re Is some good unaffected
dialogue and fair comedy, and. art aside,
the play Is one of movement and Interest

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND
Strengthens Racked Nerves.
Adjt. 5. W. Groomes, 140 East Jones St., Dayton,
Ohio, writes:
**l had great relief from Paine's Celery Compound last December.
While living: in Columbus I took a heavy cold that resulted in the urip. I
suffered intense pain with my head for three months. No medicine seem d
to do me any good until I bejjan using Paine's Celery Compound. Ail the
suffering in my head was soon gone, and 1 have Celery Compound alone to
thank for my cure."
Suffering has its first effect upon the nerves.
When the body is not sustained by nerve energy,
indigestion, slow circulation of the blood and an im-
poverished system result.

VICTIMS SAY CARELESSNESS;
GRIPMAN SAYS ACCIDENT
Cable Cars Crash Together at Sut
ter and Powell Streets and Seri
odsly Injure Two People.
BECAUSE of a gripman's bad Judgement or an Imper
fect brake â circumstances which In street railroad com
pany's logic are the direct result of a shower of rainâ
two cars crashed into each other at Slitter and Powell
streets yesterday noon. One victim Is at his home with
a damaged kneecap, a lad is badly bruised and a score of
passengers in suffering, from shock.
The force of the collision was so violent that the dummy of
the Suiter-street car knocked the Powell-street car clear
across, the track, the blow doing serious damage to both. The
cars were crowded, and in addition to those injured many were
thrown to the street. Had the cars crashed into each other
a moment earlier the Powell-street would have been struck
in the. center and a fatality could hardly have been avoided.
The dummy approached the crossing at a lively speed,
struck the rear end of the Powell-street car. on which Joseph
Kahn and a boy were Standing'; and threw them heavily to the
Boor aÂ« the car was derailed. The dummy should have waited
until the car had crossed, but the brakes were not used in
time to prevent the collision.
Joseph Kahn of 1207 Jackson street, a man of middle age
and crippled, was on the rear platform of the Powell-street

BONDS WARMLY ADVOCATED
Â»
MAYOR PHELAN APPEALS TO
CIVIC PRIDE.
If earnest work on the part of Improve
ment and district clubs can Insure suc
cess, all of the bond propositions will un
doubtedly be voted upon favorably. Last
night meetings were held in many parts
of town. All were well attended, and but
one spirit was manifestedâ the spirit of
civic pride and progress.
Mayor Phelun visited several meetings
and gave short addresses in advocacy of
the bonds, but although he asked his
hearers to question him freely regarding
any objection they might have, no one
was found who was not In accord with his
Honor's arguments.
I'ixley's Hall, at Polk street and Pacific
avenue., was crowded by members ot the
Forty-first District Improvement Club
and voters when ex-Supervisor Denman
called for order. In opening the proceed
ings he said that some of the bonds need
ed no explanation, but regarding the pan
handle there is still need lor some popular
education. "We need schools, and shall
have them," said he. '"We need sewers,
and shall have them. We certainly need a
hospital, and we shall have it. We want
our park panhandle extended, and we
should have It also. Every great city ex
tends and maintains a creditable park and
boulevard system. We must have it too,
and we certainly shall have it It our cit
izens realize the value of It and their re
sponsibility. This extension will act also
as a great firebreak between the north
and south sections of the city, and this is
a new id. a that should not be lost sight
of l expect to see all the bonds passed
by much more than the necessary two
thirds vote."
P. N. w.-llin spoke in detail of the var
ious bond propositlons^and attacked some
of the existing fallacies concerning them.
He refuted the Idea that the sewer system
would result in tearing up all the streets,
destroying existing systems and taxing
small owners out of their property, lie
explained how the various sections of the
city would be benefited and stated that
the cost would be very small compared
with the immense improvements.
Mr Wellin said that the labor question
was disposed of by the charter, which
fixed the hours and the pay of laborers.
It will require from 500 to 1000 men. prob
ably for two years. to work on the park
extension, and all the money spent will
merely change hands right here In our
own city. lie referred to the opposition
to Golden Gate Park thirty years ago and
to the many arguments that were ad
vanced against it at that time and showed
how they had been proved fallacious and
misleading.
"Was there ever a time, he asked,
"when obstructionists did not arise when
ever a public Improvement was suggest
ed? They will always be with us. but
they must not blind us nor stop us. If
Chicago had had a park running through
h/r midst at the time of her great n*rÂ© not
car. He was so severely injured that he had to be conveyed
home and at once put to bed.
"It appeared to me that the gripman of the dummy could
not have been attending to his business." said Mr. Kahn,
"for at that point Sutter street is nearly level, while Powell
approaches down a steep grade. The dummy crashed Into it
with great force, and a moment later I was picked up. dazed
and with fearful pains in my left side. I have suffered for
some years from sciatic rheumatism and now my knee is
numb and swollen considerably, and I also received a blow
on my back, which is causing considerable pain. A lad who
was stantling by me was also knocked down and carried into
a drugstore. Several passenegers were thrown from their
Seats, but not seriously hurt. I am only surprised that I was
not killed ."
The gripman of the dummy explained the accident by say
ing that the slippery condition of the tracks, due to the rain,
was- alone responsible tor the accident. One of the shocked
passengers asked him if a gripman is not supposed to make
allowance for a slippery track, but received the reply that
BUCh affairs are unavoidable accidents. The injured buy, after
being treated in a drugstore, was taken home.
one-half of that city would have been re
duced to a:'li.'s. We want to live here
and enjoy life here, and our children
want to do the nine, It is our duty to
â¢ 'fiat Owe improvements are carried
out."
A. Sbarboro. representing the Associat
ed Improvement Clubs, was the next
sj>eaker. lit* .said that he does not own a
foot of land anywhere near the line of the
proposed park improvement, but was con
vinced that by extending the park and
building the sewers every inch of the city
would he directly benefit.l .
The adoption of the new charter has
mail.' it perfectly safe for. the city to issue
bonds, for every dollar that will be spent
will go Into the proper channel for which
it was intended.
"This is not an election of brfsses," said
the speaker, "but an election In which tins
laborers and the artisans are U) determine
whether they itre to insure an era of pro
gress or whether they are going to allow
another Coxey army to march out of this
State because there Is nothing to do here
1' Is a Question of whether you will allow
t c city to sleep as sha h:us slept for the
pust live years or whether she Is to bÂ« put
in a position where she can double her
population and importance during the
next fifteen years."
Ch'-ers greeted Mayor Phelan as he
arose to speak. "Ordinarily we are divid
ed at elections," he Mid, "but ut this time
we can be united. We are to build a city
for the future. The pioneers, noble as
they were, only eared for their present
and made no plans for the future. They
intended only to make their money here
and go somewhere else to spend it. We
do not feel like that. It is true San Fran
etoco is out of debt, but if we have no
debt, it is equally true that we have noth
ing for which a debt may stand. It is only
our climatic favors that prevent this city
from being very unhealthy. Our schools
are a menace to child life; our hospital Is
a menace to tiie health of any who go
there. Oakland. Alameaa and Los An
geiei put up to shame with their beautiful
schools, anil they acquired them all by
Issuing bonds.
"It Is said that we should have necessi
ties before luxuries This is true, but
where Is the man who does not have both
if he can afford them? And is not San
Francisco wealthy en,, ugh to have both?
We save had the four walls of a house
long enough: it is now time we put a little
furniture ami a few pictures and carpets
in It. 1 would not vote to make San Ra
fael, or even Oakland, a world's resort. It
would be foolish, because they can never
be aught but suburban places and will
only get what w. leave. With San Fran-
Cteeo H Is different. We are bound to
grow and the more beautiful we make our
city, the more quickly will It grow. If the
acquisition <rf schools, parks and sewers
would retard the obtaining of our water
and light plants we might hesitate, but
these improvements we propose to acquire
now will but hel]. us in the near future to
own all our gas and water plants and per
haps other things.
Precita Valley Club.
The mass meeting which had been an
nounced for last night was unavoidably
postponed until Monday night in conse
quence of other pressing engagements ot
ttM speakeri who bad been scheduled to
addrÂ«Â»Â« the meeting.
In the awntliws the club proceeded to
transact Its regular business. John T.
Oraham, chairman of the executive com
mittee, offered s resolution indorsing the
bond kssue tor all of the features em
bodied m tile proposition. The scheme for
UWtn was Indorsed la particular, as the
section of the < Ity in which the club v*
located and for which the property own
ers bave been contending erer since the
organisation of the improvement club Is
i!.Â«Â«-d of sewer unprorements.
President J. B. Vlzzard spoke of the
dilatory tactics of the contractor who has
the tlilin,,' In of Bernal I'ark. This
lir.niÂ«ht rorth additional remarks from
Secretary Young, who announced
that the Supervisors had extended 120
more days to the contractor without any
seeming Justification, thereby protracting
the work, which should have been com
pleted months ago.
It was shown liy the statistics of the
number of families with school children
that there Is a necessity for another
school building south of Twenty-fourth
street, and to bave such a building erected
will be the aim of the property owners as
scion as the hond election so decides.
The dub has made ample preparations
for the mass meeting on next Mr>mTay
night, at which there will be able speak
ers present.
Park Sentiment.
The Trusting held at Devisadero Hall
under the auspice* of the Panhandle and
Ashbury Heights Improvement Club to
discuss the bond issues was largely at
tended. A number of speakers presented
stronp and convincing arguments favor-
Ing the proposed improvements. In call
ing the meeting to order Chairman C. D.
Saltield -xpressed the opinion that there
would not be 5000 votes cast against the
buml measures, lie had made a hoase
to-house canvass and found that business
men, merchants, lawyer* and labonng
men generally were going to vote for the
bonds.
Henry X. Clement, who was one of the
first Park Commissioners, stated that he
and his colleagues, Frank McCoppin and
<"l!;irlf>8 H. Story, had agreed upon the
need of a park at least 1000 acres in ar< a.
It was to extend west to the ocean nnd
t-aat to \an Neaa aveuue. As the charier
line extended to the west line of DeviÂ«a
dero street the city had no power to make
any reservation outside of its limits. He
contended that the only way to acquire
parks, sewers, schoolhouses and hospitals
was by the issuance of bonds.
A. 8. Baldwin said that It was not a
question of squandering money but to buy
borne valuable land that will afford pleas
ure and comfort to the people and b* a
well-paying advertisement for the entire
city. There would be no trouble to sci me
a syndicate to buy the property Intended
for the panhandle on twenty \"e.ars' ti ne
hi " per cent. It Is a cold business propo
sition that will be of great protit to the
community.
Charles Sweigert, State Senator Wolfe
Assemblyman White, Charles Alpers, G.
B. Perkins and D. C. Henderson also
spoke of the benefits that would accrue
to people in all walks of life if the 'jund
elections are favorably voted upon.
Point Lobos Club.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club met
las,, evening to consider the bond :
Oeorge R. Fletcher presided. The attend
ance was large. Resolutions were adopt
ed that Indorsed the act of Mayor Phelan
In calling for the bond election;* invited all
Improvement clubs and citizens to vote
for the bonds; approved of the action of
the Merchants' Association, and also
pledged the club members to do all that
th*-y could to carry the elections on De
cember 27 and I*9 in favor of the three
propositions.
President Fletcher said that the reports
he had received from different quarters
had convinced him that all of Richmond
favored the bond Issues and was practi
cally a unit. The Point LoboS < lub wus
the first to take up the bond issue, and
was proud of its record In that connection.
The . (tension of the panhandle and the
boulevard would be of Incalculable value
to Richmond. President Fletcher also
named committees to work for the bonds.

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
I effects of the well known remedy,
SrÃui- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually.
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irrigating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are plea.sant to the
taste, hut the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna end
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig BTBVF
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

A PROMISING LITERARY
CAREER ENDED BY DEATH
THE death of Peter E. Studebakor
at the Hotel Savoy yesterday
morning cut short what promised
to be ii brilliant literary career.
Young Mr. Studobaker was the
prnndHun of the founder of the famous
linn that bears his name and the son
of Peter E. Studebaker Sr.. who Is now
the head of the carriage baUM and
who. ,th William K. Vnnderbllt, con
trols t'. automobile trust that is capi
talized at 5200.000.000.
Born the heir to almost limitless
wealth the deceased was the victim
at .1 lii'ij-t unkind fate. An accident
in early childhood resulted in his be
coming a cripple and so shocked an
already delicate constitution that con
sumption und other troubles added
th*lr burden to the poor pain-racked
frame that he was forced to bear
through the world. Bui as a compen
sation for his physical ill nature grave
him an intellect of a very high order,
which it was Ilia pleasure to cultivate
In scientific and literary pursuits. He
became quite proflcent in the various
sciences, and when a short time ago he
gave his attention to play-writing, he
achieved almost instantaneous success
as a dramatic author. One of his recent pieces, "Sword and Scepter," a ro
mantic drama of the "Prisoner of Zenda" order, was being prepared for
presentation at tho time of Mr. Studebaker's death, and another, "Friendly
Foes." was soon to be put on the boards by the Frawlcy company.
Though young Studebaker had been suffering from a complication of com
plaints, the immediate cause of his death was heart failure, superinduced by
tho weakness resultant on a severe attack of nervous prostration from which
be had been suffering during the past week. He was barely past his twenty
first birthday at th.; time of his death, and though he had been on the coast
but a short time, he hail succeeded la winning for himself a host of friends
who â 111 mourn his untimely taking off.
The only relatives with him at the time of his death wore his mother
and sister, who had accompanied him to the Pacific Coast to look after him,
tho trip having been undertaken for the benefit of his health. He was
worth about '.000 In his own right and this will go to them. The body Is at
present at a local undertaking establishment awaiting the decision of the
family regarding Jtn final disposition.
The death of her brother makes Miss Studebaker the sole heiress of her
father's fortune and one of the richest young ladles In prospects In the United
States.

Considerable friendly rivalry was exhibited by repre
sentatives of the various cities to have the honor next
year of entertaining the convention. Mayor Sweet of San
ta Rosa Invited the delegates to hold the convention in
his city, with Its beautiful water; Joseph Spinney asked
them to go to FTesno. where they had wine stronger than
water; Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles urged them to take
the convention to his city. Th/- gentlemen named offered
various arguments In behnlf of their cities. Other dele
gates wore of the opinion that San Francisco was the
best placo for the next convention, and after three ballots
this city was chosen, Los Angeles bring neck and neck
with her until Delegate O. A. Bennett of Yreka cast the
deciding vote In favor of San Francisco.
Resolutions wore adopted thanking Mayor Phelan and
the city and county of San Francisco for hospitality ex
tended; thanking 11. A Mason for his untiring efforts as
secretary, without compensation, during the post year;
thanking B. F. Lemborn for bis work as league organizer,
and providing for the appointment of a special commit
tee of five whose duty it shall be to Investigate the mat
ter of the adoption of a uniform system In municipal ac
counts, to submit their report at the next annual conven
tion of the league.
Just before adjournment Mayor Phelan proposed the
following resolution:
Whereas, a constitutional amendment will be voted on
at the n*xt State election, exempting State, county and
municipal bonds of CRllfornla from taxation. ThÂ» Imposi
tion of this tax simply reeults In preventing our citizens
and savings banks from holding th'-fo bonds. Issued at low
rate* of Interest, and compels their sal* outside of thÂ«
State, which is a needless draupht upon our resources; and
\Vherens. It Is Illogical and unproductive of revenue for
the State to tax Its own Indebtedness;
Reno] therefore, by the league of California Munici
palities, That the people of the State be urgently requested
to vote at the next election for the constitutional amend
ment exempting from taxes all ndÂ» lesued by the State
and by the counties and cities of the State of California.
In support of the resolution the Mayor said that under
the present system it was impossible to sell such bonds
In the State, fur which reason they were bought up by
bankers In other States, Instead of by citizens of Califor
nia, who could find In them a safe and good Investment
If they were pot taxed. Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles sup
ported this view, and the resolution carried unanimously.
After luncheon the delegates boarded two special trol
ley cars at Fourth and Market streets and were whirled
over the electric lines of the Market Street Railway Com
pany for three hours. They were guided through the
Union Iron Works, taken to the garbage crematory and
the Lick School, shown all over the big electric power
house on Sixteenth street, carried along the panhandle
and pointed out the park extension, and finally were land
ed at the Cliff House. After enjoying a tasty spread to
short addresses by Mayor Phelan. Joseph Hutchinson of
Palo Alto, Mayor Eaton of Los Angeles, "Sammy" Braun
hart. Frank J. Sullivan, D. O. Druffel of Santa Clara and
B. F. Lamborn of Alameda, with three cheers for San
Francisco and its Mayor the delegates took the cars back
to town, their labors ended.

HER CONTEMPT PALPABLE
AS SHE IS A WOMAN SHE WAS
SPARED BY THE COURT.
Attorneys Stipulnte for the Compro
mise of a Claim and More's Es
tate Will Soon Be
Settled.
In answer to the citation Issued by
Judge Coffey. Eliza M. Miller, adminis
tratrix of the estate of the late Alexander
P. More, appeared In court yesterday
morning to show cause why she ehould
not file her final account. Mrs. Miller was
called to the stand and the court Imme
diately called her to account for state
ments she had made reflecting on his. con
duct In the case. * Mrs. Miller admitted
having expressed her opinion of the ac
tions of the court as published, whereupon
Van R. Paterson arose and demanded her
suspension as executrix on the ground
that hor prejudice and evident misman
agement of the estate were resulting in
great damage to other heirs. Judge Cof
rey said that she was plainly In contempt
of court, but as she was a woman the
court wns Indisposed to punish her. Judge
Coffey also said that he would not sus
pend her, as It would only complicate
matters and she was allowed to remain
in power.
Mrs. Miller then presented an answer to
the citation requiring her to render her
final account as administratrix. She al
leged that it was Impossible for her to
settle the estate at the present time, as
such settlement was prevented by a suit
pending in the Supreme Court, by which
U. Clifford More, as administrator of the
estate of Lawrence \V. More, sought to
recover $13,670 14 from the estate 01 A. P.
More. The attorneys representing the
heirs then stipulated that the claim be
compromised for 50 pÂ«Â»r cent of the sum.
The case then went over till next Wednes
day, and In the meantime an effort will
be made by Mrs. Miller to reach an agree
ment with the claimant.
Mrs. Miller denies that Helen K. Row*Â»'Â«
share of the estate, which practically con
sists of one-t\venty-fourth>)f Santa Rosa
Island, can be distributed to her without
loss to the estate, and this application for
distribution will also be heard on Wednes
day.

X. THE HOME IN ITS RELA
TION TO THE STATE.
Every one, or almost every one. unites
in pralÂ»e of the family and the home. It
is the original unit of the state and the
ultimate test of its soundness. On the one
hand good conditions here are the abso
lutely necessary prerequisites of pood so
cial conditions Kenerally. On the other
hand happy home conditions are, the inti
mate object of most human endeavor.
James Russell Lowell Fays In one of his
delightful letters: "You say that life
seems to be a struggle after nothing in
particular. But you are wrong. It Is a
struggle after the peaceful home of the
soul In a natural and loving state of life.
Men are mostly unconscious of the object
of their struggle, but It Is always connect
ed In some way with this. If they gain
wealth or power or glory It la always to
make up for this want which they feel
but scarce know what It la."
Nevertheless, when so much is said tn
a general way of the Importance of the
home remarkably little attention seems to
be paid to It In tho concrete. Whenever
the need Is felt of "doing something."
whenivcr a want Is detected, any agency
rather than the home is reported tn
cation must be made more eompfate, and
the school Is Instituted. ThÂ»- little child
must be taught to occupy itself, to ob
serve, to adapt Itself to others; hap;
wholesome moods must be made habitual
to it, and the kindergarten takes in the
little one. Religious training must be
made as far-reaching as possible, and the
Sunday school spreads over the land and
in large measure substitutes itself f'.r
home teaching. There is felt to be a lack
of mean* of recreation, and sociables and
girls" and boys' clubs and other organised
schemes are started. Mothers no longer
find time to read as they didâ let th m
form reading circles and read together,
or clubs and study and debatÂ« togeth'-r.
From religion to whist, the tendency is
to organize groups of persons, selected
for their common interest in some
one matter, to exercise or Indulge
themselves together in a special dir
meeting on only one side of their lives.
themselves more or less all of one cla^a
and with a corresponding narrowr. :
experience to be got from one another.
AH this is the direct opposite of the
conditions' at home life, where a small
number of persons of t >th wm, unlik- in
age and generally In tastes, but united by
close personal ties, meet, not for one spe
cialized kind of activity, but in the multi
farious unclasslflable activities of home
life.
It Is obvious that the tendency to rr
ganlze in groups, cutting across the famllv
group, is natural and Inevitable. It Is also
obvious that It brings about very- great
advantages. It Is equally obvious that It
tends to take from the duties and activi
ties that find their place within tho fam
ily circle, to lessen the scope of the family
lifo, which is the object of so much en
thusiasm.
This change. It ts Interesting to notice.
Is quite In accordance with the trend ~>f
the development of the family as far an
w* know it? history. In early Rome the
state was essentially a federation of pa
triachally organized family groups. Each
family contained not only the immediate
family, as we understand It. but a much
more extended circle of relativesâ uncles,
cousins, married sons and grandchildrenâ
besides the slaves. These were bound to
gether by the common and a!
authority of the patriarch head of the
family (paterfamilias), who had the right
to even kill his children or to sell th-m
as slaves. This group was bound togeth
er, too, by the worship of its ancestors
and the sacred ceremonies of the hearth,
which gave It Its chief sanctity and im
portance.
Many of these features reproduce them
selves more or less exactly In the nv>*t
diverse nations and diverse times. To?
patriarchal famiiy of the early H*bre*s.
the Chinese family to-day, with its an
cestor worship and intense filial piety, nre
examples.
Such a family may bo studied from
many different aspects, as a body of kin
dred, as a household, as an economic com
munity, as a religious group or as a po lt
tcal unit (whether independent, as a clan
or an imperlum in lmperio, a state viihin
the state.i.
In all these aspects the tendency has
been similarâ to reduce the family group,
to simplify it. to give over its vaiiDUS
functions, as they develop, to be carried
on In new ways and In a more highly or
ganized form outside the family. The
typical family comes to contain only the
parents and unmarried children. The rites
Of rÂ«'llt;i'in are observed not mainly with
in the family, but In public worship. The
family authority not only extends over a
Btnaller group, but its scope Is constantly
Â1 by the growth of public author
( law, of the state.
This family law had two Fidesâ the au
thority of the family, vested In Its bond,
over Its own members, and. secondly, the
duty of the family to protect itÂ» own
members from outside aggression. Th*Â»
origin of our own penal law Is In the tribal
codes of retribution whereby one family
could exact from another damages for In-
Jury Inflicted by one of Its members. In
place of Â»he otherwise obligatory .evenge.
with the endless counter revenge* of a
blood feud thereby entailed. It rested also
with the fomily to punish Its own offend
ing members, whether for Injuries with
in Its own circle or for Injuries to out
siders entailing general cost to the group.
It wns a HKMMntoUI ' - hanee when the
state took from the family (and from the
Individual) the, right of revenge and the
-Ibllity for defense ami undert >.>k
to preserve order hy public rules and by
public powerâ a step In civilization which
Is not yet accepted, to our shame. In all
p.irtÃ of our country. whether among
Georgia lyncherÂ» or Kentucky feud flght-
K'lunlly momentous was the other ride
of this change, when th<- "tat-- took from
the hand of the father the right to punish
the fTOWH son. thus bringing about the
direct relation between the state and the
individual citizen which characterizes
ni' .;â¢ m < ivili2utl<>n.
Nowhere, perhaps. haÂ« the disintegra
tion of the family pone further than in
this country, where children so early oeek
Independent live*, where parents are so
little disposed to exert authority.
Some radicals not only prophesy !,ut
desire a further movement In this direc
tion. They <rlticize family life as econ
omically wasteful and unsatisfactory, ;is
dwarfing and stultifying to the individual,
as bietrtllH a family selfishness which Is
as harmful to society as persona;
â netful*.
To most of us. In spite of the element
of truth In these criticisms, th* family
seems to have a raison d'etre which Is bo
fundamental, po far-reaching that It Is,
like all the deepest things, almost Impos
sible to prove or to analyze. The fact
that the tendency has been for thousands
of years to simplify the family group,
both In Its composition and Its activities,'
does not In the least mean that there Is a
tendency to do away with It. On the con
trary, the essentials of the family may be
only brought Into higher relief by being
thus separated,.
'i*â¢' â¢ ji r Â». .Var.nr-t E. gangster. Mr*.
Miss Anna Harrow., Mr Mary Holx-rts a , th
md other*. *
The family ha* functions which cannot
be taken from it without unspeakable
loss. it gives to the future citizen that
early education that education which is
largely preconj-clous even, which Is tho
most Important of oil. nn<l It educates all
its im-mbtrn. as can be done in no other
wny. on the intimate personal si<lf\ No
education In the world romparos with that
received by the parent! in bringing up &
child. The kelflsh become unseltlsh. the
frivolous earnent, th. careless responsible,
the foolish wise, at least In 11 degree.
Here. In an intensely Individualistic soci
ety, a limited communism Is practiced,
which keeps alive the Ideal of fraternal
dealings. Here the parent realizes that
he has a stake In the country exceeding
the span of his own lifetime and his own
Interests.
The way to Mrengthen the family is
not mainly to organize societies to Â»tuÂ«ly
or Improve It, but for etuh Individual to
bring his own family life to the highest
possible plane, to create a home atmos
phere where family affection doea n^>t

the retail trade In seasonable lines baa been
effected in some localities by unfavorable
weather holiday specialties have enjoy. i ex
ceptional activity. As regards prices It is a
notable tact that as many staples hnve ad
advanced this week as have declined, while
by far the larger number of quotations have
remained steady or firm. The strength of tex
tiles is still a most notable feature of the
general situation. Cotton goods are heavily
sold ahead by agents and a very large spring
business has already, been booked. Raw cot
ton la firm and unchanKt-U on the week, partly
owing to the light receipts and to reafflrma
tion of a short crop estimated by the De
partment of Agriculture.
Manufactured goods, where not advanced, are
firmly held. Wool it- less active than of late,
but prices are not less firm and BOOM finer
gradc-H are quoted higher. The London market
haa closed at an advance over the last sale
and talk of higher prices with the first of
the year it. common. Woolen goods share the
strength of the raw material and silks and
products are also linnly held.
Corn, among th â¢ cereal?, has displayed a
specially strong tone, owing to small receipts
and depleted stocks. Provisions have weakened
after the recent advance, but lard and pork
are still higher than last week, and hoc re
ceipts are rather emaller than expected. Wheat
has been steady, partly on foreign reports of
cold weather, partly because of intimations of
international disturbances and because of ex
pectatiGna of a bullish Government crop re
port.
In most lines of Iron and steel quietness and
firmness are confident. Estimates of produc
tion point to a net gain In stock, and a source
â¢â ! strength Is the claim made that th* fur
: nace capacity for half of next year at least
Is already booked. .... m ore have been
. a.-me and although nothing like the rush to
book production witnessed a year ago has
been seen a large part of next year's output
Is expectod to be placed by the close of the
' .'-ear. What little weakness there is percepti
â  ble Is in a few lines of finished product.
Hardware Is in quite active demand at a
; number of markets on holiday specialties. In
| other metals there Is considerable Irregularity.
| Tin In again dull and copper Is being shaded.
j while lead Is higher. The open season, usually
\ not regarded an favorable In the anthracite
coal trade, is this year welcomed because it
; allows or unimpeded shipments later than
: usual. High water In the Ohio has released
i a large quantity of bituminous coal and the
: outlook Ib for replenished Western stocks.
; At the East, however, bituminous coal Is still
I In scant supply.

Dun s Review of Trade.
NEW YORK. Dee. IS â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
! weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
] Unusual depression In stocks this week has
displayed the great divergence between the
' trading and the productive Industries of the
| country and Its speculation. Never has pro-
I duction been greater, the number of haflia
employed larger, the wages distributed higher,
nor the purchasing power based on earnings
greater than at this time. and never have Â11-
j dltlons of trade or returns Of earnings and
traffic given more certainty of greater .>usl
, ness for transporters. Yet an the earnings
of the railways and manufacturing companies
mount upward tJiHr stocks decline us If it
were disastrous for a roud to double Its earn
ings and ruinous for a mill to realize unpre
cedented prospect*. Inflated capitalization has.
of course, done much barm and speculative
excitement has counted profits in many oases
i long before they were earned. Money markets
here and abroad have been strained by British
I reverses In South Africa, and wherever they
; were overloaded have been pushed to quick
1 and disastrous Instead of gradual liquidation.
The result Is that the Industries and tranx
ponlng companies realize great profits, thÂ«
speculative holders of their t>tocks realize se
i vere losses.
Iron production still expands. The iron Age
reports the output of pig :: m.<<.<>:. 9m .<<.<>:.9 tons weekly
December 1. against 255.512 tons November 1.
The decrease in stocks not held by the great
steel companies la 5200 tons. A Plttsburg com- 1
l pany bought 40,000 tons of Bessemer for $24
at Valley mill, which Is below recent prices
I and Oray forge Is quoted a shade lower at
$21. Bars are again irregular, Lie for com
1 mon at PlttsbUrg and 2.2 c for refined nt the
I Bast and plates nnt exceeding sixty inches i
are sold at 2.1 cby mills out of orders, while
it Is said 2.4e is shaded at times for No. 27
black sheets, but nearly all works still have
, orders far ahead and In other specialties prices i
are unchanged.
The collapse of London speculation dropped
j the quotation of tin to 24c here, with recovery
to 25 1 , c, and copper Is weak at 16*ic, but
lead Is a shade stronger.
The boot and shoe works are hastening de
liveries to meet the enormous consuming de
mand and have shipped from Boston 188.421
cases In two weeks â¢â¢ December, against "2. -
C.',\ last year and still less In any other year
except I*&7. when 191.524 cn.-t.-s were shii.|.*.l. 1
The same dealers who urge early delivery on j
past orders at lower prices are slow to pll4M
more at the higher prices now asked, white
most of the works holding orders for some I
time ahead are not anxious to take more &t
present.
The approaching holidays make all welcome
a season of quiet. Leather continues vÂ»ry
strong, with scanty supplies of Â«sole but great
demands for upper.
The movement of wheat Is disappointing, but
priors have declined only SS I.1 '. With corn a
fraction higher. Atlantic exports of wheat.
Hour included, have In two weeks of Decem
ber been only 5.32*. 604 bushels, against 11.1?$,- '
4i!Â« bushels last year, and Pacific exports were
1.501.957 bushels, against L2M.U4 bushels last ]
year. Shrinkage In Western receipts only 8.- i
975.725 bushels, having come forward In two
weeks. against 17.745.411 bushels last year. Is
remarkable, though the movement then was
abnormal.
Exports of breadstufts In November decreased
t5.500.000. which, with the losses of $000,000 In !
provisions and $13.nfK>.000 In cotton, lowered the
value of staple exports $15,337,567 . In spite of
an Increase of 000. 000 In oil. Hut enormous ]
â¢shipments of products made the excess of ex
ports over Imports more than $49,000,000 for the ,
month.
Wool did not advance further, though sales
(scarcely diminish and have been 22.075,000 ;
pounds In two weeks at the three chief mar- j
kets, so far exceeding all consuming demand* [
that peculation must still account for moat
of the business, but there was less excitement
and more buying by small works. No change
In quotations of good appear, though In pome
heavy weights for fall advances of 10 to 15 J
per cent are reported.
Failures for the week were 21R In the fnlt.d
States, against Ml last year, and 26 In Canada, ;
against 31 last year.

an excellent demand, commission houses com
liiK Into the pit with pood outside orders.
Speculators bought with confidence in even

day; May lard closed I2'iÂ©lsc up and May

Wheat was dull and heavy, there being a
Reneral disposition to await the Government
crop report, which was not due until after trad

strength of llrht Northwest receipts, and the
steadiness of the. Liverpool market. Mar open

These wen the propositions and the ap
proximate amounts that will be allowed
for each, as determined by the. City Coun
cil, to be submitted to the people of Oak
land at a bond election- So the first move
toward bonds has been made. The City
Council In committee of the whole to
r.lght began the discussion of City At
torney L'uv'a report upon the method of
submitting the bond question to the peo
ple. 1 hey started a little at sea and
Mayor Snow read to them a message that
he had prepared upon the bond question.
"A careful figuring shows that 15 cents
lidded to the tax levy of Oakland will pay
:he Interest and the one-fortieth redemp
tion on each million dollars* worth of
bonds," â¢Kan the Mayor. "If the Im
provement to be made can Increase the
v alue of the property of this city 16,500.000
then the taxes on this Increased valua
:on will pay the Interest and redemption
n each million dollars worth of bonds
and there will be no Increase In the tax
rate. Therefore It will be only necessary
0 Increase the assessed valuation of Oak
land 100 per cent In twenty years to be
itile to pay the Interest and redemption
â i $4,(vj,'>oo In bonds without an Increase
In the tax levy, and Oakland has more
.ban doubled in assessed valuation In the
ast twenty years."
-Mayor Snow th<*n went over the propo
-itaons which he suggested, lie urged the
.(instruction by bonoa of tho southern and
western Intercepting Fewera and a storm
â Â«iwer for the annexed districts. In order
:o. Increase the aseessment valuation ox
he city he proposed ihu purchase of some
â !' ::.- low lands along the southern and
'â â¢ su-rn shr>rÂ«\ the improvement of this
;ind under the park and boulevard act by
1 ppeclaJ Issue of bonds and the leasing of
his. laud tor manufacturing. Tins he held
Aould so Improve other land In the nelgh
:>< rfaood of thes* sewers as to bring up
.he valuation and the municipal Income.
L'ndcr the law a separate election must
; - held tor parks, boulevards and thor
nughlarcs, and Mayor Snow buggested
iha.t about JSCw.OOO be set aside for theso
jiurpoees, of which -".wo will bo for per
manent crosswalks. This money, ho t aid.
s-hould only bo asked for from the people
after the most definite plans had been
jjrepared for a system of parks.
For the building of wharves ho recom
mended no specific amount, but that one
Krand plan for tho city should be first
adopted, and that this plan should always
be adhered to, but that it should be car
ried out from tlmo to time as the people
choc* to vote the bonds.
On water works the Mayor said:
"Until State absorption of pnvato water
X ants for the benefit of municipalities oc
turs bond money Invested by cities In a
water system that Is any less complete
than that of the private corporations sup
'.ylrg too city will always result In an
apparent lose that will have to bo paid
cut of tho treasury. That loss will be
moro apparent than real, for \*hile water
rates are ncmlnally fixed by the Council
they are really regulated by competition,
â¢md a system of pipes that would supply
water to Oakland would reduce the cost of
â¢water to consumers, wherever laid, 50 per
cent below the present charges. It Is
j robeÂ«blÂ« that tI&O.CWO annually could be
taved the people of Oakland, which would
bo Interest and redemption upon $2,500,000
In bonds.
"If the fresh water for consumption
Tiropoeltlon is submitted the salt water for
s-prfnkllng will bo unnecessary, but the

CREEDS OF THE
CHURCHES MUST
BE BROADENED
Remarkable Address
of a Layman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Dec. 15.
Deputy City Attorney Seymour \V. Con
don made a remarkable address at the
meeting of the Bay Association of Con
gregational Churches last e\*enlng. Ha
spoke for a modification of creeds and de
clared that creeds should be broad enough
to take In any one who wanted to wor
ship God.
â¢â¢Every church." eald he. "has Its own
peculiarities, but also It has that which Is
In common with every churchâ the com
mon worship of God. For years 1 have
been studying these separate churches,
and through all these years I have been
incapable of understanding the verbal ma
chinery, the costly apparatus of creed,
by which we worship. But through all
this there is only one thing which appeals
to me and that is the common worship of
God on a common basis. Young men are
barred out of the church by the creed
which you maintain.
"We have not the strength to say that
we as a church are â¢willing to make our
creed broad enough for , all. There are
broad minded men who are kept out be
cause they cannot honestly declare they
believe in all to which we adhere. There
is a great moral waste in the- cost of
this great religious machinery; but it is
not all waste which should keep men
away. It is because they fad themselves
up again.n a statement of creed they
subscribe to honestly ami squarely.
"There is a crisis in our churches and
religious thought of this period. The time
is coming when we have no right to take
our yard stick and tell our brother wo
cannot worship under the same roof. The
tendency is to subdivide, and this should
not be.
"The church should modify Its creed so
as to keep no heart out. It should take
; in all those whose hearts beat true to God.
Not to do this is to violate tho sacred
trust of the church."
The remarks caused no little friendly
discussion. _______^___ â
Society.
OAKLAND. Dec. 15.â Mr. John Vance
Cheney was the guest of the Ebell So
clty at luncheon Tuesday and enter
tained the members with one of her de
lightful talks. There was a fairly large
and very representative attendance and
In si!' of the threatening Idea the af
fair proved to be one of the pleasantest
of the year. The luncheon tables were
especially pretty, decorated in green and
red, Christmas berries being employed.
Mrs. Cheney, in her talk, spoke of the
necessity of lifting the- mind dally from
the little things of life And fixing It upon
the higher and nobler. She quoted Pro
fessor Gates of Amhcrst, who said that
with only thirty days of spiritual eleva
tion of this kind would come marked re-
Eults. Faith, she said further, was the
keynote to success, and argued that In
the present case of the securing of the
funds for the now library site, faith had
been the means of accomplishing much.
After Mrs. Cheney's address, Mrs. K. P.
Gleason, the president of Ebell, spoke for
a few moments on the entertainment to
bo given Thursday evening at the Mac
donough Theater for the augmenting of
the site fund and urged redoubled
efforts on the part of the ladles in the
disposing of tickets for the evening.
The luncheon was rendered additionally
pleasant through the kindness of Miss
Maud Wellendorff of Berkeley, who play
ed thrÂ«e piano selections in splendid style.

ST. MARCUS GERMAN CHURCH
IS INVOLVED.
Lutheran Organization Seeks to Sell
Church Property to Meet Big
Note and Rev. Jatho's
Back Salary.
Oakland Office San Frar.rlsco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 15.
According to a petition filed In the Su
perior Court this afternoon, asking for an
authorization to sell certain church prop
erty, it appears that the St. Marcus Ger
man Lutheran Church on Filbert street,
Seventh, U heavily involved in debt.
The petition was filed by William E. F.
Wehr and G. Magerstaedt, president and
secretary respectively of the church or
ganization, which is incorporated under
the laws of this State, and the property
they ask to be allowed to sell 1h that on
which the church .stands on the east side
of Filbert street, MO feet north of Sev
enth; and the reason given is that the
church has do money with which to meet
a certain promissory note made on June
13. 18?6, for the sum of $5000. and an in
debtedness of $800 due the pastor, Rev. A.
Jatho. for back salary.
The obvious inability of the church to
meet tliees obligations was thoroughly
discussed at a m.'<tlng of the church trus
tees, held last Monday, and after due
consideration it was decided that the only
means by which the debt could be paid
would be by raising money from a sale
of the church property, and the president
and secretary were thereupon instructed
to apply to the Superior Court for power
to make the sale.
The matter will come up before Supe
rior Judge Greene on December 22.

THE FUND IS COMPLETE.
The Women Have Performed a Pub

Praise.
The EbÂ«ll Society; through Its p--;ldent,
Mrs. R. P. GleaBon. to-day sent Its an
swering message of gratitude to C. P.
Huntingdon for his contribution of 13009 to
the library site fund. The message ran.
The ladle* of the Ehell send to Mr. Hunt-
Ington their heartfelt thanks for his gra- '
clous and uÂ«Â»n*r'"'us addition to this library
fund. It has Insured their success. The
announcement of the splendid gift to Oak
land was made last evening to a mati
meetlnt? of citizens and was received with
(treat applause.
MRS. R. P. GLEAPON,
President.
Mr. Huntington's proffer of the gift
was somewhat more lengthy than the
Ebell's telegram of thanks and contained
a line that expressed surprise at Oak
land's not having raised the money
through other methods than solicitingsub
soriptlons. The telegram was as follows:
Mrs. n. P. Glea*in. Ebell. Oakland:
Telegram received. I have multitude of
calls for money, so many that I have to
turn most of them down, but as I can see
the dlfÃcultjr you must have experienced In
raising money to buy a site for a library
that another party Is to erect, which will
of course give all the credit to him, I will
Rive you the J3OOO you need. It Deem* to
me, though, that this would have been a
proper and appropriate thins for the city
to do through a tax upon all ltd citizens.
C. P. HUNTINQTON.
Though thÂ© society feels that a great
responsibility has been lifted, leaving the
organization entirely successful as far as
the matter of the site is concerned, the
ladles did not altogether cease their tabors
to-day. The treasurer of the library site
committee. Miss Babson, was on hand, as
usual, to receive contributions, for It is
Intended that all surplus In the fund shall
be devoted to the equipment of a chil
dren's room In the new library building.
The children of the city have already sub
scribed $123 91 to this purpose and this
has been doubled by the children's com
mittee of the Ebell, so that now there Is
$274 52 pledged for the Juvenile room.
More contributions are coming in rapidly
and It is expected that the baseball game
on Saturday afternoon of next week be
tween the city and county officials will
still further swell the fund. Miss Mor
ton's pupils have given a generous dona
tionâas the result of an entertain
ment.
It has been suggested that the children's
fund be raised to $5000 In order that an
elegant room may be fitted up. This fol
lows the Idea as carried out in the Bos
ton Library. The ladles In charge of this
matter ire the original committeeâ Mrs
F. B. Glnn. Dr. Myra Knox, Mrs. R. P.
Oleason. Dr. C. Annette Bucket and Mrs
John Russ. Miss Babson will be treas
urer.
The Ebell in Its Joy to-day did not for
get the next business step necessary and
this afternoon a communication was di
rected to the City Council reporting suc
cess, officially and offering the $20 000 At
the meeting of the Council on Monday
night action on this formal proffer will
be taken. The communication reads:
To the Honorable, the Council of the City
of Gentlemen: The Ebell Bo
ciety has the honor to report to you that
pursuant to the extension of time given
therefor by your honorable body and
within the time so allowed we have suc
ceeded In raising by voluntary subscrip
tions the sum of twenty thousand dollars
(SM.000). for the purchase of the library
site at the southwest corner of Grove and
Fourteenth streets (100 feet on Grove street
by 1M on Fourteenth), that the title to said
lot Is perfect and clear and that the deed
of the same to the city of Oakland will be
promptly obtained and delivered.
The time of our option having been ex
. tended and part of the money having been
paid, there Is no uncertainty in this direc
tion. Very respectfully,

would be lacking that amount or over at
the expiration of the option. Since there
waa nothing lacking the bank will not be
called upon to pay.
With the consummation of the site
matter Oakland finds herself awaiting the
erection of two public buildingsâ the li
brary and the postofflce. Within a fort
night both sites have been secured and it
is only a question of a few months when
the buildings will be und^r way. This
fortnight, therefore, will be regarded as a
new turning point in local bistort, for
both buildings are badly needed and hi\Â«
been long desired.
The movement f<>r the library site can
not but be most gratifying to the Bbell,
for It has beÂ»Â»n â  C''m-r;il <>n<- Into which
the public has entered gladly In no way

one. From the most prominent and from
the mnpt modest gifts were accepted and
with equal pleasure; ami It is probable
that in every ease the 25-cent contribution
of a schoolboy or the $1 donation "f a
mechanic was received with mure genuine
delight by the ladles than the more muni
ficent pledges. The widespread good will
in the work was shown in on*' way la^t
evening, and particularly remarked by the
ladle*, by the presence of the gleo club at
the First Presbyterian Church and it* evi
dent willingness to help make the meeting
a pleasant one.
MILLER ON COST OF
CROSSWALK SYSTEM
OAKLAND. Dec 15.â Street Superin
tendent Miller hub made a report to
Mayor Snow regarding the cost of laying
E roper crosswalks throughout the city to
c used in connection with the Question of
the proposed bond Issue.
Mr. Miller shows that the total number
of crosswalks In the city Is 1350, combina
tion wooden culverts and crosswalks 1200,
bituminous crosswalks 340; total 2X90. At
aoout 250 points in the city no crosswalks
have ever been built, though to subserve
public convenience there should have
teen, and at least 100 crosswalks could be
constructed to good advantage In the
more thickly settled sections of the an
nexed district. At present about one-fifth
of the wooden crosswalks in the city are
more or less in need of repair.
The Street Superintendent estimates
that to substitute concrete, iron and
bitumen for wood in the reconstruction of
combination crosswalks and culverts the
total expense will amount approximately
to $75 for each walk; the cost of recon
structing 600 crosswalks in bitumen at $38
will be $22,800; 400 combination crosswalks
and culverts at $75, $30,000. making a total
of $52,800.

Change in Foreign Rates Declared to
Be the Cause of the Ex

NEW YORK. Dec. 15.â Wall street re
ceived with little surprise to-day the an
nouncements of gold shipments to Europe.
There has been talk to that effect all
through the week, and with the change In
foreign rates it was declared that exports
were inevitable.
The lust engagement announced was
that of &00.GGO by the banking house of
Belmont & Co., and although the news
first came from the sub-treasury it wan
said the gold would not be drawn from

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
Ml Broadway I
Papers were prepared M-day and se"rve<l
upon Mayor R. W. Snow In" the threatened
suit against him for personal property
commissions collected by him while Aud
itor and Assessor of the city of Oakland]
The papers were sworn to by 11. D. Howe,
president of the City Council of Oakland,
and were prepared by M. C. Chapman an. l
Fred V. Wood, as attorneys, and thÂ»
amount sued for Is $*517 21. the amount or
the commission between the years 1553
and IMC.
These papers arc not a full raft, but
rather a preliminary hearing before tnÂ«Â»
Attorney General of the State In a request
for permission to sue Mayor Snow In thÂ«Â»
name of the State. When threats of *uic
against the May i were made M. ('. Chi[>
man was employed to examine the law.
and it was found that suit could only be
brought In two ways, by the Oakland City
Council or by some taxpayer with thÂ»
consent of the Attorney General. The City
Council has up to the present refused t<Â»
bring the suit and has postponed action
for three months, and this It Is believed
means that no such action will ever i<
taken. That left the matter where It w.i *
necessary to bring a suit against thÂ«
Mayor in the name of some taxpayer with
the consent of Attorney General Ford.
In such cases Mr. Ford has made a rulÂ»Â»
that he will grant no such requests until
a hearing has been given earn Hide. Â«md
In making such a request It I- necessary
to prepare the complaint It Is proposed t.Â»
file, together with the argument* nÂ» to
why the name of the State Is desired.
These must b*. filed with the Attorney
General and served upon the defendant,
and the defendent then has ten days In
which to make reply. The Attorney Gen
eral gives his decision upon these papers.
The suit again- Mayor Hnow will tako
this course. The complaint WU drawn to
day and served upon the Mayor to-night
and will be filed with the Attorney Un
eral at once. 11. I). Row*, the president
of the Council, finally derided to bring;
the suit In hi* own name, and so he pj>
pears as the complainant niM.rnt 'â !>â â¢
Mayor. The suit Ik brought acalnst May
or Snow and against George T. Hawley
and E. A. Heron, who were hi* lands
men as Auditor and Assessor in l v >",.
â¢â¢I have Snail) decided to bring thu *ult
in my own name if 1 can secure the ne.vs
sary permission." said Mr. Ilnwe to-nunt.
"1 believe that I am right and when I
1 hold that belief It would be cowardly not
to be willing to use my own nnraÂ», and *Â«Â»
I will bring the suit If 1 can get th* op
portunity. Th<Â» complaint merely nay*
that In 1536 Mr. Snow took $'Â£17 Zl wnich
he claimed as the commissions upon thÂ«
collection of personal property tax** for
the seven years previous. It thÂ»n state*
that the charter of Oakland provides that
no city ni!li ial shall be entitle), to any
compensatlon aside from hi* salary, art!
that this was In addition 10 his* salary.
Accompanying this complaint Is a hrl'f
of arguments why I should â¢â â¢ permlttr<l
to bring this Mil In the name >r th*
State. Mr. Snow win be given an opirr
tunlty to answer this brief. If Attorney
General Ford decides not to grant my
request my suit falls, but If I get ttin
necessary permission the suit will be filed
at once and In my namÂ« This Is r>-... > a
preliminary hearing of the case.
"I have only brought suit fox thoso
seven years' commissions because th it
amount was taken at once and was *.h>*
first amount taken. Should I get permis
sion to bring the suit 1 will all Ale in .
other suits for about HbtM in all. repre

QUAY PROFESSES TO BE
SANGUINE OF VICTORY
Denies That He Will Withdraw From
the Fight Without a Vote
Being Taken.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.-Senator Quay
does not agree with the predictions mado
by some of his friends that his case be
fore the Senate Is hopeless. On the con
trary, when I saw him at his burnt to
night he seemed In the best of spirits and
entirely optimistic as to the results.
"I Just arrived in the city to-day." ho
said, "and have not yet had (Ira to mahu
a thorough canvass of the situation, but
I believe that I will be seated."
"It has been said. Senator, that jroti
would ask the Governor to recall your ap
pointment In case you should find it Im
possible to obtain a majority In your fa
vor." I observed.
"That is not so." replied Mr Quay. "My
case is before the Senate and . will stay
In the fight until It Is disposed of. I have
no objection to a vote being taken at any
time.'
Mr. Quay declined to say anything. fur
ther for publication, d. clarmc that he h.i I
not been here lons enough to nÂ»cÂ«Â»rtnlrÂ»
thÂ© exact situation; but that he was qult.Â»
willing to nave the matter decided on It*
merits.
The Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections will have a meeting to-morrow
to hear arguments by former Senator E I
munds and Lawyer Wilson against thÂ«
seating of Quay and by th* Attorney Gen
eral of Pennsylvania In his behalf. Tho
hearings will bo public.

SACRAMENTO. Dec. 15.â There was a
meeting at the State Capitol to-day of
the superintendents of the State Hospitals
for the Insane, together with one mem
ber of each managing board, with the
State Commission in Lunacy. In the ab-
Eence of the Governor Daniel Kevaue,
secretary of the StatÂ© Board of Exam
iners, presided.
The purpose of the meeting was to Re
vise methods for the Improvement of the
administration of the various- institutions.
It was rt-solved to appoint a committee to
be named later to provide a unrform sys
tem of by-laws for the several asylums.
It was also decided to form a commit lee
to bo revise the contract schedules that
articles and supplies of uniform descrip
tions shall be furnished the State lnsil
tutions, ihus giving the State the benefit
of small margins by bidders.
It was also resolved to bring about a
revision of the diet table bo that more uni
formity would be obtained in the feeding
of the inmates at the five asylums.
Quit" a discussion was had relative to
the duty of the superintendents in caring
for cases of r.current Insanity, but the
opinion was general that mu.-h must be
left In these matters to the discretion of
the medical superintendents. It developed
that much carelessness Is practiced in the
commitment of Insane patients and wry
often persons ar>- sent by county examin
ers t" the asylum without a proper show
ing or without Informing the asylum man
agers as to the peculiarities in the case.
At the afternoon session a desultory dis
cussion respecting the recently adopted
salary schedule was indulged in. Several
of the doctors and members of the Board
of Managers objected to the cut made in
the snlarieÃ of some of the employes.
After hearing all complaints the com
n went into executive session, and
when the doors were reopened the follow
ing changfp wre announced in the salary
schedule adopted about two weeks ago:
Beeretary to ny Â«li^a.l superintendent. 1100
per month with maintenance. $125 with
out. Instead of $100 flat; treasurer and sec
retary t" Board t%t Managers, $70 per
month, instead of $50: laundryman, $60 per
month, instead of $o5; female night at
tendant. $.V). Instead of $40; servant to

, $50 without; servant to assistant

A yellow sensation Â«ns pricks and

The sensational story waÂ« to the effect
that the man was murdered about a

la ;Â«.n, tho sailors having struck for
higher wayes and the dÂ«*cea.<Â«-d being a

It was not a case of murder. Dr. ZabaU

FIRE FIEND OF A HOODOO
THEATER SOUGHT BY POLICE
I J
0' San Francisco's oldest play
houses, around which is associated
many incidents of the early ''ays,
was damaged by a fire yesterday
afternoon, which left little of the
building: hut its miter walls and the
memory of its past successes.
The tire is supposed to be of incendiary
l origin
Shortly after 1 o'clock fire was dlÂ»
< covered on the stage of the old
Push Street Theater. As poon as
, Chief Sullivan of th* Fire Depart
, ment arrived on th<Â» scene he appreciated
i the sorlr.usiie?s of tnr * situation and a see
| ond and a third alarm wore rung in. The
Inflammable character of the interior of
the building made the blaze an extremely
dangerous one. and had it not been for the
well-constructed outor wall of brick the
greater part of thÂ« block, bounded by
Kearny. Montgomery, Sutter and Bush
streets,' would have been destroyed.
The firemen made â  heroic fight
against the blaze and kept the flames
within the confines of the walla of the old
theater building. By 3 o'clock the fire
was practically extinguished. The theater
was destroyed, but the only damage suf
fered by the surrounding buildings was
from the smoke that swept through them
In clouds. The loss is roughly estimated
to be JlS.fOrt and (a fully covered by insur
ance. The following companies carry
\ lines on the theater building: Sun of
Ixindon. H*>oo; Greenwich, $3r.00;3 r .00; Westches
ter. SSSOO; Home of New York. 13000; Home
Mutual, $15nO: Springfield. (2000; a total of
Â«2 # >.O*i. The property is owned by the
Shields estate.
While many of the firemen had narrow
e*ca>-'s from Injury during the progress
of the fire, none of them were seriously
hurt. Extraman Rich of Engine 17 was
near -a portion of the roof when it fell
and In rushing for safety grabbed a piece
â¢ if rapped tin, severing the arteries of his
wrist and severely slashing the fingers of
his left hand. His wounds wore dressed
by I Â»r. Morrison of the Harbor EfospitnL
. Chief Sullivan had a hall breadth escape
from falling through the burning roof
Into the seething furnace of flames below.
He was Htanding on the roof when he felt
it giving away beneath him and Jumped.
He was grabbed by member* of Engine 3,
Jufi as the Umbers tumbled.

eral detectives, Â»â Â«.< last night scouring

pending further investigation.
Shortly before midnight Stone was seen
walking hurriedly down Fifth street and
the Fire Marshal was at once lnforme.l of
the fact. Summoning two of Captain

DEFENSE OF FAIR'S
CHILDREN NOT GOOD
I JUDGE TROUTT SUSTAINS MRS.
CRAVEN'S DEMURRER,
Petition for an Allowance for Main
tenance Will Now Go to Trial
on Its Merits.
For a second time Judge Troutt has
sustained the demurrers of Mrs. Nettie
R. Craven to the separate answers of
Charles I. Fair. Teresa A. Oelrichs anil
Virginia Vanderbilt. and her application
for a family allowance from the estate
'of the late James G. Fair will now be
j heard on its merits. In his opinion Judge
1 Troutt pays:
"In the separate answers offered by the '
respondents it is in effect alleged thai on â 
April 13. 1537. on the children's application
fr,r distribution to them of a portion of
the real property of the estate, it was
decreed by this court that they were the !
sole heirs of. the decedent and hence enti- i
tled to a distribution to themselves of
the whole of such property, and also that
Nettle H. Craven had actual knowledge
: as well a* constructive notice of the ap
plication for partial distribution, and had
an opportunity then to prove that she, as
the decedent's widow, was one of the
heirs, and that having then failed to as
sert any claim to such share in Buch dis
tribution she is forever bound by the re
cital in the decree declaring the" children
to be decedent's sole heirs.
"The demurrer urges that these allega
tions do not constitute a defense to her
petition. On the other side, however. It
is contended that these facts when proven

entered Into negotiations with Elling
hou.Â«e to rent tlie A 1 ham bra. Stone rep
lesrnted that he had "money to burn."
and that lie intended to become the fore
most theatrical manager of the United
States. When the time came for Stone
to pay the rent of the theater he de
clared that he had lost a portion of his
imaginary wealth in a disastrous mining
deal, but promised to pay the amount on
the following day.
Kllinghouso â¢ came suspicious and or
dered Stone out of the theater, together
with his company. Incensed at the action
of KllinghoiiFe the "colonel" uttered loud
and angry threats and procuring a bowle
knife and a pistol that looked like it had
done service in the war of the rebellion,
he started out with the fixed Intel I of
sending the theatrical manager to the
Morgue. Stone's wife, on learning thrt
the company had been thrown nut of the
Alhamhra. went to Klllnghouse and plead
ed with him to allow the "â tars" to per
form.
"II will break my husband's heart if
you don't," she tearfully remarked. "You
know he Is so wrapped up In them."
Touched by her pitiful appeal KMlnÃ
houae consented to allow the troupe of
dilapidated perform*" rs to occupy the
theater for one week. He confidently ex
pected that Stone would at least keep his
promise to pay the rent, but In this he
was mistaken.
About a week ago ElllnÃhnuso rented
the Hush-street Theater for an indefinite
period. StÂ« " after being ejected from the
Palace and other hotels took his company
to the Hush-street playhouse, as he had
no other place to go. They were Installed
in the property room of the theater and
proceefferl to make themselves at home.
Again Stone failed to pay the rent of the
theater, and the wandering band "was
again thrown Into the street.
Shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday after
noon the "colonel" went to the theater
and meeting the watchman severely crif
clzed Elllnphouse and swore to be re
venged on him. He paid he was going to
asserting herself to be the decedent's
widow, and hence will defeat her applica
tion for an allowance out of the estate.
"By reference to section 14R6 of the Code
of Civil Procedure It appears that It Is
the duty of the court to make such rea-
FonaMo allowance out of the estate of a
decedent as shall be necessary for the
maintenance of the widow during the
progress of the settlement of the estate,
it ifÂ» conceivable that a decedent's estate
might ronfclst entirely of separate prop
erty and be entirely disposed of by will
to some other person other than the wife.
Nevertheless, the widow. It is apparent,
would be entitled to a reasonable allow
ance out of the estate for her mainten
ance during the period of time designated
by the statute.

The watchman, who the police say was
under the Influence of liquor, a few min
utes later left the thenter to â â â¢ â¢' â¢'â¢ >Irlnk.
Stone was standing outside and he would
have had little trouble, so the detect lVCÃ
argue, to re-enter the playhouse and set
fire to it. It is known that he did not ap
pear at Raver's office until some lime af
ter the fire. He seemed nervous and de
manded pufllcient money to pay his debt*.
Raver refu-ed to let him have any money
and he at once left the place.
About five years apo Stone was em
ployed as watchman at the Maze, on Mar
ket street. He was there only a short
time when various articles disappeared as
if by mafic. Suspicion was directed to
him. and ho was taken Into custody. As
ho seemed to be mentally deranged he
was examined as to his Insanity an* sent
to the Stockton Asylum for the Insane.
Several months later ho escaped and went
to Honolulu.

speculation. Madame Fabri-Mueller'a

Two Convicted by Judge Mognn of

Their Possession.
Willam Harris and Fred Turner, who
were arrested late Wednesday night at
Fell and Filbert streets by Policemen
Carrier and O'Connor for having burg
lars' tools In their possession, appeared
before Judge Mogan yesterday. They
were acting suspiciously, which fact at
tracted the attention of the officer? and
when they were searched each had a
piece of iron shaped at the point like .1
"jimmy.
They are genuine specimens of the
'hobo, and when the Judge asked them
what they were Intending to do they
frankly admitted that their object was
burglary. "We were hungry.' said Har
ris, "and had to do something. We found
the pieces of iron on the water front and
went out on the cars to look for a suit
able place to break Into. After wandering
around we thought it was sinful to take
other people's property and were on our
way back to the water front when the
officers arrested us.**
Harris Is from Minneapolis and Turner
from Illinois. They mm on a brakebeam
between Portland and this city. The Judge
did not believe their tale of being hungry
and their sudden conversion and ordered
them to appear for sentence this morning.

RESULT OF THE CONFERENCES

NEW FORM OF AGREEMENT IS
DEMANDED.

Governor Gape chanced his plans and
left the city for Sacramento on the Ore
gon express at I o'clock Thursday even-
Ing. Several politicians v.-: had expected
to see him and talk on extra session topics
were disappointed when they ascertained
that he had gone to the capital. Two con
ferences were held Thursday, and at tho
second one. which took place after 6
o'clock In the afternoon. It was decided
that the extra session should not be called
before the middle of January. The pro
gramme in this respect is open to revision.
The enthusiastic advocates of the special
session still insist, however, that th. Gov
ernor will issue the proclamation without
delay.
Within the past week D. M. Burn* has
stated positively to his contldentiul i>up
porters that he would not accept an up
pointment ad United Btali Sc.iator even
if the Senate fhould decide to admit Mr.
Quay of I't-nnsylvania.
Burns' thirty supporters have not yet
signed the agreement for the extra ses
sion. Many Senators and Assemblymen
who are not opposed to an extra session
declare against the pledge which had been
presented for signatures and which sev
eral members have signed. The aim baM
legislators who have not signed any pa
per want a caucus of the whole Republi
can membership of the legislature, and
they desire a provision against secret bal
lot in caucus.
Tho Call ascertains that tha opposition
to the election of Burns Is now stronger
than it was on the day the regular ses
sion adjourned. Assemblyman iluber Is
said to be the only recruit that Burn has
gained since last winter. It is not even
surf that Burns fa Huber'a first choice.
Men- who wagered and lost ler^e Bums
of money last winter on the proposition
that Burns would be elected Senator have
lost betting confidence. One of the heav
iest losers remarked yesterday that Hums
developed his â¢ Mr.' strength at the regu
lar session, and that the tifty-slx anti
railroad members were masters of the sit'
uation.
Senator Thomas Flint left the city yes
terday for his home at Ban Juan, Sena
tor John F. Davis of Jackson also left
town for home yesterday morning. Sena
tor Morehouse has returned to Santa
Clara County.
