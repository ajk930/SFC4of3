<>f their fire our infantry and Thorny

3:30 a party of Boers were observed mov

and receiving no reply to their opening

had made a sortie. Later dispatches announce that General White sortied from
Ladysmith and inflicted a demoralizing defeat upon the Boers.
It would be premature to give full credence to either report. What is quite
certain is that Ladysmith, Estcourt and the Mooi River station are all isolated and
the Boers seem able after detaching enough troops to hold three British foi
aggregating 17,000 men, to push on toward Pietermaritzburg with some 7000
men.
A disquieting feature of the whole campaign is the fact that all the advanc- j
ing generals report meeting the Boers in force. In view of the brilliant success of
General Joubert in partially paralyzing the relieving columns the question is I <
asked. What would have happened had he at the outset of the war. instead of sit
ting down before Ladysmith. pushed on to Pietermaritzburg?
General Gatacre's report that the Dutch are rising increases public anxiety,
as it tends to confirm rumors that have long been current. A special dispatch
from Durban announces that more big naval guns were landed Wednesday and
sent to the front. Prince Christian Victor left the Mooi River camp before it 1
was invested, bearing dispatches tn Pietermai ; tzburg.
Late last evening it was asserted at Aldershot that the Sixth division, now in \
process of mobilization, will actually be required for active service. Some of the
yoemanry agents have been warned for mobilization owing to the scarcity of cav
alry in Africa. It is also reported that another brigade of horse artillery will be
mobilized. 1

During the entire movement from Ger

the insurgent army, and the Mayor, with
General Mac Arthur and Colonel Bell In>

the town. Gener.il Mac Arthur received
an ovation. Explaining the Americans*
Intentions, he announced they intended to
garrison all the towns on the railroad.
Hundreds of men are in the n>id harvest

ers in the territory assert that Aguinaldo
was not expecting th-; American advanco

is true many rifles are likely to be brought
in to secure the 130 offered for each
weapon seized.

"I am authorised to say most positively

Special Dispatch to The Pall.
TACOMA, Nov. '.:..â Tn a secluded spot
a few miles from Tacoma lies buried flO,
000 in gold coin, the savings of a life of
care â  id toll, while in a casket at Hoska's
undertaking parlors repose the remains of
a man who accumulated this treasure,
dollar by dollar, and hid it where no
prying eyes might find and take It from
him. Whether the burled treasure will
ever be found is a question, but a deter
mined search was started to-day.
John McNeil, who accumulated and bu-
I ried the treasure, died at the County Hos
pital last night. Before his spirit passed
i he told of his wealth and wept tears of
grlet that he could not leave his bed and
show the way to the gold that the rela
tives who survive him might be made
comfortable after he was gone.
About two weeks ago Mre. Daniel Mc-
Carthy made application for the admis
sion of her father, John McNeil, to the
County Hospital. He was old, eccentric
! and almost helpless. He was taken In
and It then developed he was not with
out funds, for In a wallet that he cart
fully guarded was a quantity of gold. It
soon became evident that the end was
near, and McNeil then conflded to his
physician that he had thousands of dol
lars buried eight miles from town.
Ha begged Dr. Heliker to get him Into
such a condition that he could go and
unearth the treasure which he declared
no other person could find. He tried to
tell where the fortune was burled, but
he had taken such pains -to conceal its
whereabouts that bis explanation wan not
Intelligible. When his trunk was exam
ined it was found to contain a compli
cate!, diagram, which may enable his
relatives to locate the treasure.
McNeil was S9 years old. Mrs. McCarthy
and Mrs. Hush, a granddaughter, are his
nearest relatives. â¢
MORE EXPLANATIONS
AS TO -DEWEY" ARCH
NEW YORK. Nov. 23.â Colonel William
Conant Church, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the committee for the
perpetuation of the Dewey arch, to-day
made a lengthy statement in regard to
the relation of the arch to Admiral
Dewey. :;\
"The arch," he said, "is to be the Dewey
arch in the sense it has always been. It
is certain that the fame of Admiral
Dewey and the battle of Manila Bay are
to be commemorated in the arch, and
there is little doubt that it will be known
as the Dewey arch Just as the Trafalgar
column In London is called the Nelson
monument."
DEWEY IS GRATEFUL.
Gratified at the Invitation Extended
to Visit Chicago.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 23.-"Yes." said
Admiral DewÂ«jr, with an appearance of In
tense â¢ faction in his manner, to-day,
"l received to-day a telegram from i.he
Mayor of Chicago supplementing the let
ter of the Dewey committee of that city
inviting me to visit there on the Ist of
May. You may Bay in your dispatches
that, all things being equal, and barring
' any unlooked for circumstances, I shall
accept the Invitation to visit the city on
the Ist of May. I have been thinking of
Feme place In which to spend thai any.
the anniwrsary of the memorable day tiro
years ugo, and I don't know 01 any more
agrei-able city in which to spend it than
Chicago. The people there have been kind
and pleasant to me, and ever since '.he
battle of Manila I have been receiving
evidences of their good-will and affection.
My hope, therefore, Is to be able to ac
cept the Invitation which has been ex
tended to me."
The evidence of good-will and kindness
indicated by the letter from the commit
tee and the Mayor is a source of extreme
gratification to the admiral at this time,
! and he embraced the opportunity offered
by their request to reiterate his thanks
to the people who have stood by him in
i the face of criticism which has appeared
as a result of a. change in the title of the
property given by the American people.
"From every section of the country," he
says, "have telegrams and letters come to
me showing the good-will and kindness of
the American people. It is impossible for
mo to acknowledge each one of these com
â  munications individually, but I assure you
j that 1 am deeply grateful to their senders
; and appreciate their consideration. 1 am
I constantly receiving tokens of good-will
'. from the people, as you will see by look
ing around this room and seeing the beau
tiful things that have been tent to me. I
have been in my office all day long look-
Ing over the telegrams and letters which
have come. I don't care to make any ob
servations on the criticisms which have
> arisen as a result of the transfer of the
property other than those which I have
already given public expression to.
Enough has already been said, and I now
\ want to live quietly and peaceably."

SAMOAN TREATY
IS DRAWN UP
Another Signed by Ger
many and England.
Special IMspat -h to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â Two treaties
for the final partition of the Samoan Inl
ands have been drawn, and one of them
already has been signed. The main treaty
is trilateral in character, between the
United States, Great Britain and Ger
many, by which the territorial arrange
ment of the islands is fixed. It Is quite
brief, comprising only four or five articles,
tha essential features being that Great
Britain and Germany renounce all claims
in the island of Tutuila and the outlying
islands, which go to the United State",
and this Government and Groat Britain
renounce Interest in Upolu and Savftli.
which go to Germany. The present ex
: pectation is that this treaty will be signed
in Washington, in which case Secretary
Hay and Embassadors Pauncefote and
Yon Holleben will be the signatory par
ties, although '.t is still possible that the
execution of the document may occur in
London.
The second treaty is between Grett
Britain and Germany, and is longer an
the first, covering the rights and interests
In the Tonga and the Solomon Islands and
other settlements, brought about by the
Bamoan partition. The United States do<;s
not sign this treaty, and Is only indiffer
1 ently concerned. It is understood that this
collateral treaty has already been exe
cuted in Berlin, and that the signing of
the trilateral treaty will bring to a close
the negotiations for the division of the
I islands.

REWARD FOR LEE
AND WHEELER
Will Be Made Regular
Officers.
'
Special D;Â«p*tch to The CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING- :
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Nov. 23 â !
There are s<>od reasons for believing that
President MrKinley will reward three dis
tinguished volunteer officers now In the
service by appointing and retiring them
with th 9 rank anl pay of brigadier gen
eral of the rijrular army. These oiHcers
are General Joseph Wheeler, General ,
Fitzhugh Lee and Genera! James Wilson.
The appointments of Generals Wheeler
and Lee will be particularly pleasing to
the South, and will doubtless be accepted
generally as another evidence of the Pres
ident's desire to deal liberally with the
ex-Confederate generals who so promptly
came to the nation's deicnÂ«e, and thus j
wi;>e out all traces of sectionalism grow- j
itig out of the rebellion.
While there is no specific law permit- i
ting the ap;>ointment of volunteers to
brigadier generalships In the regular
army, there is nothing in the statutes to
prohibit it. The popularity of the Ocen
it is believed, will assure confirmations of
their nominations if sent to the Senate,
and in this way their appointments will
be legalized anil they will t>e permitted to
enjoy a liberal pension for the rest of
their lives. It Is understood that the
President has delayed tilling the existing
vacancies In the icra<le cf brigadier gen
eral largely through his rt^slre to provide
for these three ottlcors in the manner in
dicated. The appointments will not be
made until some time in January, when
another vacancy aril occur by the retire
ment of General Anderson. By this lime,
the authorities believe that reduction In
the volunteer command will be in order,
and It is probable that vacancies in the
grade of brigadier general will be utilized
as a channel through which several de
1 serving officers In the regular service, as
well as the three volunteer generals
named, will find their way to th*Â» retired
list of the regular army. Eventually it Is
proposed to reward Generals \oung.
Lawton .if.l Arthur with higher com
missions than they now hold In the regu
lar establishment.

had been reported In .'ew York. He had
recently consulted a physician and he had
been advised to refrain from severe train-
Ing for a few weeks and to take a com
plete rest from conditioning work. It
appears to be the opinion of his friends
here that his present trouble resulted
from too constant training and that he
haÂ« not taken sufficient rest between his

METCALF OFFERS
HIS RESIGNATION
Too Many Scandals in
Dental Board.
OTHERS MAY FOLLOW HIM
MAJORITY AGREED TO DROP
OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY.
Metcalf Became Tired of Waiting for
the Others to Act and Tendered
His Itesignation to the
Governor.
>
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 23.â The scandal
in the State Board of Dental Examiners
reached a culmination this afternoon, at
least in so far as one of its members Is
concerned, since Dr. F. H. Metcalf of
Sacramento notified the Governor that
his resignation was in his hands. In re
sponse to a request to-night for a state
ment for The Call Dr. Metcalf said that
he could no longer remain on the board
and retain his self-respect.
Governor Gage left the city this after
noon and It Is not known that he ex
pressed himself as to the disturbances
which occasioned Dr. Metca'.f's resigna
tion. It had be*-n expected that Dr. Met
calfs rej-iznation would be simultaneous
with that oi other members of the board,
who had expressed dissatisfaction with
the manner to which the good name of
the membership as a whole had become
Involved, but the act of Dr. Metcalf to
day is taken as evidence that he became
tired of the delay and decided to bring
things to a point at once. It was sup
posed that Dr. P. F. Tebbets would also
present his resignation, but there i* as
yet no positive indication that he has any
such intention.
SaIdLrFJJ. Metcalf jo reporter oi
The call to-night: "1 have no personal
animosity toward Dr. Tebfcets*. and am
sorry to be obliged to resign, as the ap
pointment was a pleasant recognition
coming from the chief executive- but i
! could not do otherwise and retain my self
i respect. After our troubles at the exam
ination of applicants for certirtcares in
August last, ending In a personal quarrel
between Dr. Cranz and Ur. Yebbets the
latter told me that he would resign, gtvlng
me his word as a fellow practitioner and
brother Elk that he would do so by Sep
tember 1 He failed to keep his word
I wrote to another member of the board lv
reference to the matteV. but before I re
ceivetl a reply the newspapers had gut
hold of the affair and it became common
property. I certainly could not blame Dr.
Tebbeta for not resigning then. The mat
ter was taken up by the Governor, who
referred It to the Attorney General, and
his rÂ«Â»ply. leaving the matter with the
board, has been published.
V? 0 /"/ :hr ** c weeks ago a meeting was
i called for the purpose of making an mves-
I tigation into the charges against Dr Teb
bets. Witnesses had been notlried to be
present, but none appeared, with the ex-
I ceptJon of a Chinese, who claimed, when
i questioned, to have no knowledge of the
I matter one way or the other, arid Dr. W
[ C. King of San Francisco, to whom the
i Armenian who had made m- of the
I charges had related his story. A depoÂ«i
! tlon from this Armenian was "also at hand
i The other witnesses who had been direct
1 ed to appear not having done so. the
. meeting was adjourned to enable further
: efforts to be made to secure their attend
; ance. The meeting following was held
last Saturday nisrht. and. the witnesses
i still not appearing. It was voted that the
; evidence was not sufficient to substantiate
; the charges, and the matter was dropped
; It was generally understood at that time
i that a majority of the board would re

The Spjrtsmen"s Ass<xriation and the
Supervisor* of Stanislaus County have
re^eivM H setback at the hands of the
Justices of the Supreme Court. Some time
; ago the Stanislaus Supervisors passed an
; ordinance making it v midemeanor to ship
| same <>ut of the county. This was aimed
at the market hunters, who persisted in
using huge scatter guns throwing a pound
; of shot into the Hocks of birds.
The fir^t : orson to contest this mii!
; r.ar.ce was a market hunter r.2.mtr<l James
; Knapj>. who attempted to ship a quanti
â¢ ty of ducks to this city. He wa? arrested
; and nr.vd $2b with the alternative of
. twenty days In Ja!l. Tho case v.-as car
i rled to the Supreme Court and h?.*rd yes

The attorney for Knapp. In his argu
ment on 'he writ of habeas corpuÂ«. con
tended that the ordinance was unconsti
tutional, inasmuch as the name of rhe
country was the property of the public
anil more especially the property of the
man who killed it. and that this being
so tho owner had a right to do wi;h It as

eight of the eleven long-distance riders
who started yesterday In the six-day bi

the game. Plummer. the local rl^er.
John Chapman of Atlanta and Fred Nel

BOXER GEORGE GREEN WANTS A NEW REFEREE CHOSEN.
GEORGE GREEN has availed himself of the privilege accorded boxers
and prlma donnas, and has changed h!s mind on the all-Important
question of a referee for his engagement with Al Ncill to-night.
Charlen Long, proposed by Ne!!l, was accepted for the position at a
conference between the men on Wednesday evening. Green* friends car
ried Btorie* to him yesterday about Long, wit the result that he decided not
to enter the ring until a referee more acceptable to him replaced Long. On
broad grounds the objection to the latter is based on the charge that he Is
a betting man. An effort was made to bring the boxers together last night,
but without avail. They will meet this afternoon at i o'clock and will settle
the disturbing question before they enter the ring. The National Club mana
gers insist upon the men reaching ait agreement, so that thete may be no
hitch once the men enter the ring.
The betting at Harry i"m; !..â â¢â¢ yesterday was steady throughout the
day. each man apparently having a large following. The odds on both bouts
remained unchanged. N>i!l and Maxwell being the favorites. In the mu
tuels. out of 4Â»5 tickets sold 262 were on N-?lll and M on Green.
The main bout will be a twenty-round affair, while the preliminary will
be of fifteen rounds' duration. Maxwell and Turner are both clever, ag
gressive boxers, and there seems but small chance of their bout reaching
the limit. The colored man is a finished boxer of the most modern school
and has many admirers here. The meeting between himself and Maxwell has
attracted ps much attention as has the main bout. The men are expected
to enter the ring at Woodward's Pavilion to-night at 5 3"'.

F. W. Brode Beaten in a
Ga ; lopâ Several Surprises
at Oaklanl
In Duckoy, a big, growthy looking son
â of imp. Brutus and Decoy Duck, the
Burns & Waterhouse stable introduced an
â¢ apparently very useful piece of racing
\ hardware to the public at Oakland yester
' day. One of the twelve entries in the five
! furlong dash, second on the card, the ring
' laid 6 and 7 to 1 about the youngster, and
â  he plowed through the muddy going like
\ a Yukon ice cutter. F. W. Brode, thÂ«
i crack two-year-old of the Schorr string.
I finish* second, with the favorite. Mort
; page, third. The winner was ridden by
i l.harley Thorpe and had pounds to spare
'â  at the finish.
The track was still in a muddy condi
tion, but there was no "path" for the
riders to battle for. Three ia\orltes met
defeat, still there were no reversals for
the crowd to grumble about.
In the first number, a seven furiong
selling affair, tne all white colors of \V.
I F. fc?hultÂ«.- were seen to marked advantage
j for the nrst time at the meeting. Schan

Scbrelb< r's horse Â»\\i\xt handily. Ross
more, the old jumper, piloted t>y Burn?,
ran third.
Barney Schreiber's colors met with more
succesain the third event. Miss Marlon,
at odds of 1 to 2. won in a big gallop froxn
Balibta. Ihe fa.^t mare fenowred a f.rÂ«e
flight of speed anil shuuld win mnny a

Lovdal enjoyed the honors of favoritism,
with Mrailowthorpe and Lavator equally
well backed. Jennie Rt-id. New Moon and

From that on It was only a canter for the.

Southern Girl had altogether too much
speed for Princess Zeika in the two-year
old sprint owr the Futurity course. The

lncr that place a terriSe storm came up.
which lasted for four days. On the Hth
inst. tt blew a hurricane and at times it
sÂ«~mrd as rhoush the stout little steamer
wcuid be engulfed.
Mary of the passenrers were In the

Another sea broke aboard and carried
away the corner, of the after-house.
slashed the port lifeboat Into kindling
â wood and wrecked a steam launch that
waÂ« on deck. Another wave flooded the
engrlne-rcvm. and for a while it seemed
as though the fires would be put out.
After this the storm let up for a while.
but it soon began to blow with renewed
force. It was a. circular Kale. When i:
first came up the wind was from the I
nvrtheaÂ«. but when it b-esran to blow j
aroin !: wa.< from the south-southwest, j
On this occasion the passengers were all
put down in the hold and the hatches
battened down on them. There they lived
for four hours, and one and all declare
that such a time ther never experienced ;
In th'lr lives before, some of them nearly '

were recovering from typhoid fever con- 1
tracted at Nome, while seme had been
down to sea in ships before; but none of
them had ever experienced anything to
compare with that four hours in the hold

Finally the storm abated and the men j
were allowed en deck apaia. The heavy
weather continued, and last Tuesday was j
the Srst bit of decent weather the steamer 1
had during the run from Dutch Harbor. 1
Early in the morning the schooner Ohal- |

heavy southeast storms and also that he

SYMPATHY GOES
TO STRUGGLING
ARMY Of BOERS
Mass - Meeting Held
Last Night.
BRITISH ACTION DENOUNCED
JOH^' P. TRTSH GRIXXS JOHN
HAYZS HAXiIOXD.
War Ccsipar-d to the Unequal Strife
Against Natives of Philippines.
Horal Support Extended
the Bepublic.
There Is a warm place la the hearts cf
San Franciscans tor the Boers of the
Transvaal. Judging from the monster
meeting held last night it Metropolitan
Temple by the sympathizers In this city
of the people of the South African re
public In their war with Great Britain.
Among the speakers, whose sentiments
were received with tumultuous applause.
were Jean P. Irish. William H. AlTord
and Colonel Thomas F. Barry. Ringi-g
resolutions were adopted expressing
sympathy with th* Beers and cor.d*mr.-
Ing that portion of the press which is en
deavoring to create the imprcj-a.cn th.it
the United States li an ally of England
In the present struggle. Incidentally im
perialism was denounced, it being claimed
that Uncle Sam's actions in the Philip
pines were --. _ parallel with Great Brit
ain I*,1 *, treatment of the Boers.
William H. Aivord was introduced as
th* chairman cf the meeting. said
that its purpose was to stamp a^ ar." in
famous libel en the people of th* United
states the statement that they were
either openly or secretly allied w-.th Great
Britain cr approved cf ar^y war that was
r.ot:n defers of liberty and Justice.
"This occasion Is net a joyous cne."
said the speaker. "Every "expression
must be cne of regret ar.d every- breath
a sigh. Everything In this strife indi
cates that ta it ail En-glaxd has be*n
wrong ar.d the Bc*rÂ« have bÂ«*n right.
While w* ar* pointing to the faults of
our r.eirhbor we should not overiook our
own. There has only b*en one nation
great enough to follow the morning star
cf liberty, rut we are dimmin? the luster
cf our glory by the prosecution of a war
against the Filipinos equally as unjusti
fiable as the war against the Bo<?r?.
While we ar* locking at the acts of Great
Britain, let us ur.roll again the Declara
tion of Independence."
The next speaker was L. M. CroweH cf
the Hastings Law School, who wen a
debate on tn* B-?*r question against rep
resentatives from th* University cf Cali
fornia. He reviewed the >eai "status of
th* Transvaal situation and "claimed that
according tO the treaties cf ISSI anJ ISM
England had no Justifiable excuse for the
war that she is now waging. He aÂ«
strted ... Beers w*r* net asking for
m*rcy. but fcr justice, and that th* strife
was one of th* strong striving to suppress
the weak.
Much enthusiasm was created by the
remarks of J^hn P. IriÂ«h. whose addr-ss
was the fÂ»a:ur* cf the meeting. He gave
considerable attention to the "gang plank
opinions" of John Hayes Hammond.
"This man was mixed u^> in the Jameson
raids." said Mr. Irish. "H* did a little
raiding and then th* B-:ers dM some raid
ing. The latter prove-i to b* thjÂ» better
raiders and caught son* of th* offenders,
among them Kimmord, who was sen
tenced to be hanged. 'Wner. this country
maci* a plea for his neck Oom Paul saia
to him. 'I don't want to hang you; It
would be putting good rope to a bad us*.'
and h* let him off wit a big f.r.*. And
this Is the kind cf a man who comes
back to \i3 and says that there is no jus-
tice on the side of the Boers In this s'rur
gle."
Colonel Barry introduced the resolutions
referred to. which were adopted with
great applause. Three cheers were given
for the Boer republic at the close of the
meeting.
â¢MUCH ADO ABOUT XOTHIXG.'
"Shakespeare's Greatest Structural
Achievenieat." Says Howard
Ticknor.
ThÂ» last of the cours-e of lectures with
which Howard Malcolm Ticknor has for
the last â¢â â â â  weeks been delighting me
society litterateurs was delivered by him
at th* First Unitarian Church. Geary as 3
Franklin streets. yes:erday afternoon. An
even larger audience than canal greeted
the f.r.al appearance cf th- lecturer an.]
chairs ----- at a premium. The subject
chosen by Mr. Tlckncr was "'Shakespeare
Considered as a Dramatic Constructor."
and the medium chosen for the exposition
of the port's knowledge of statecraft
was "Much Ado About Ncthing." ThÂ»
comedy was referred to by the lecturer
as being the greatest triumph from Â«
structural point of view of the whole
Shakespearean drama. The expEanatlori
offered of the title was that It referred
to the tremendous toil and trouble which
the effort* to bring two people who love
each other to own their feelings ccc*
sioueti-
In speaking of Benedick, he said: "The
basis of all comedy is incongruity. And
of course, if in comedy we can make a
man who Is in love appear to imagine
he Isn't, when he ts forced to acknow
ledge his true feelings there will be all
the more laughter."
Touching on the necessity of the heavy
element of the piece, the lecturer de
clared that "in a comedy that is five acts
long there must of necessity be some op
position to the happy denouement both
in order tnat the pray may run Its five
acts and that the pleasant results mat
gain In effect by temporary frustration."
Mr. Ticknor during his stay here ..as
made many friends, and with his frlendlv.
unassuming talks on men and books Im
parted more general knowledge of litera
ture to his audiences than could hayÂ»
been gained from the conning of many
pretentious volumes on the subject. He
will remain In California till January.
To-night he lectures to the members ot
the Stockton Round Table Club on "Lit
erary Celebrities. 1 '

The InJiars were all sent west of â¢' - Missouri River,
then down on the geography as the Great American
Desert, to prow up with the star-spangled Sahara.
The largest band of them, subnamexi Musquaka?, un
der the headship of Chief Poweshick, languished on
the Platte. Lcup and Elkhorn river bottoms for a
time and then returned and bought several sections of
land in Tama County, settled thereon and have lived
at peace with all the world ever since. They are treated
as reservation Indians and have an agent. They
. have drawn their annuities, raised squaw com, made
maple supar and trapped muskrats for more than
thirty years. Their chief. Kec-nee-saw, who managed
their return to the soil of their sires, died long ago
and was buried in a tree-top, and others have suc
ceeded him. Among thr:n were half-castes, in whose
veins coursed some of the beft pior.eer blood of lowa,
flowing from those far frontier days when laws and
customs were lax in "the settlements."
They would never have been heard of by the out
side world had not their agent been recently seized
with a rage for education. Desiring to conduct them
across the Pons aÂ«inorum to a higher civilization, he
bnilt a schoolhouse and proceeded to make education
compulsory. In gathering them into the arms of
modem culture he imprudently corralled a girl
named Lc-bh-Puck-a-chee. Now, Puckachee in
their language means "Get out," "Go away," and had
the agent known this he would have avoided trouble,
for Le-lah is a married woman, and is thereby under
the laws of lowa raised out of the class of school age
who may be rounded up and inoculated with knowl
edge of the three R's. Her husband, Mr. Ta-ta-pe
cha, which means "Good-by, my dear," refused to live
up to it, and when his wife was taken from him by
force and imprisoned in the school compound in the
uncongrnial company of a spel!ing-book and waÂ«h
jbasirf he put on his war paint and feathers and stirred
the tribe to mutiny and rage. The people of Toledo
and T?.ma City have brcn mounting guard for a week
as a precaution against massacre. The chief,
N*ie-a tauco-sy, which means horse, is minded to show
that he is no nsÂ« and does rot propose that the
matrons of his tribe shall have thesr domestic duties
fiiÂ«r>pnÂ«M by a fool agent. The very county in which
his !ot i< cast is named for that Tamah, a learned
chif f who figures in Schoolcraft'j "American Indians,"
r.nd on a field ?o baptized the pride of the aborigine
regents this effort to crrm unnecessary facts ad fig
ures dosra thnr throats. A white man who reiects his
jiart of the burden has :nduced a specni fitting of the
Federal court to issue the great writ of liberty to
Madam Puck-a-chee. r.nd it is probable that white
winged pearr will car.fi there soon and that the hor
rors wrought by Ink-pah~dutah nt Spirit Lake will not
be repeated. The affair raises the very interesting
question whether the Government can compel In
dians to attend school, and whether, this power
granted, attempts to educate by force can produce any
testing good.

DEALING WITH MALAYS.
THE Chicago Times-Herald, pointing to the ex
ample of Great Britain in dealing with alien
races, say* that when between thÂ«m and the
whites war is or.cc begun the whites must dictate the
terms of peace or surrender all authority. It con
cludes, therefore, that we have no alternative except
to crush the Filipinos, "it it take twenty or fifty
years." In the same article the case of Holland and
Acheea is referred to. In that case the Acheenese
Malays, in Northern Sumatra, while under British
rule had made agreements and treaties with Great
â : which were to be indefeasible. England cede!
Acheen to Holland by treaty. Holland disregarded
the British treaties, voided their terms and withdrew
whatever protection they implied to the Acheenese.
This planted in the Malay lÂ«r< ; ; ~t a sense of wrong
which caused a revolt that has continued for
â¢ five years. hi every battle the Dutch
hare won, but the moment military vigilance
of the sternest form is relaxed the fight is
red. It has cost Holland SO dearly that all the
Cones of her Asiatic possessions have been
'â â¢'. <\ by it and a balance is left to the bad side of
her colonial account. It is not in the heart of a free
n;an to condemn any people who fight because they
have been wronged and cheated, and while this trait
in the Malay character is regarded by imperialists as
deserving nothing better than the crushing process,
administered by an army, still it is a trait common to
all races that have made any mark in history.
It is not useful now to review the history of the
Philippine war. Two incidents that preceded it suf
fice for illustration. When the President said that
forcible annexation was criminal aggression opposed
to our code of morals, and the Senate of the United
States foil wed ratification of the Paris treaty by a
solemn resolution <!eclaring that it was not our pur
' p<->cc to annex the Philippines, two official pledges of
the highest order were .Liven to the world and to the
people immediately concerned. When these were
added to what had preceded them, the Singapore
agreement with Aguinaldo, his landing at Cavite, his
proclamation of a government prepared for him by
- Consul General at Hongkong, his expulsion of
Spanish sovereignty from the four islands before the
. n will l>e seen that we have
â  and .i problem on a parity with that of
been. The question for us to consider,
fnr the pi â  I â¢ pass upon, is, Arc we to

nnded and has been maintained and
Holland as the
ran be devised? If we do. notwithstanding
c rosy reports, there is no reason to believe that
the succe-s o f the prc-ent campaign will end the
th.,n that in Acheen has been
ended by a Dutch victory in every battle. If we don't
have twenty or fiftj real tual war we muÂ«t
qutvalent in constant readiness for war and
heavy garrisons throughout the islands.
Th:s V.;'! be necessary, because it is probably true
that the natives feel that same sense of injury which
the Acheenese refuse to for( I

Where they may en with the 0 I :' an enemy
may we not go with the unarmed hand and open palm

siderations arc suggested there is an outcry about the
trade and the u'i'tenng wealth of those possessing

and their rights as owners or tcna-its of all the wealth

prestige of a republic differs from that of a monarchy.
Our truest prestige is in an inflexible adherence to jus
tice and morality in all dealings with other people,
and in promptly righting wrongs we may do either by
inadvertence or misdirected intention.

hereafter will seek alliances not only where there are
great armies but where there is the money required to
maintain them in the field if war should come.
Judging from the mystery surrounding the present
whereabouts of Aguinaldo and his Cabinet, it takes
no expert to venture the opinion that it is one of those
disappearing affairs you read about.
f~* ONSIDERABLE attention is given in the
I larger cities of the East to the good results ob-
taincd in New York during the last two years
by a system of daily medical examination of the health
of school-children. From the reports it appears the
:-cial effects of the work have been notable in
many ways, and it is likely a similar system will soon
be pm into operation in other cities.
In outlining the plan upon which the inspection is
maintained in New York one of the officials of the
Board of Education of that city stated to a cor
respondent of the Philadelphia Ledger: 'In this in
spection are included all the public and parochial
schools. The inspecting physicians are appointed by
the Mayor and are paid $30 a month for their ser
vices. The city is cut up into districts, and the schools
in each divided among the inspectors, some having
several schools to visit. They report at the schools
from 8:50 to 9:30 every morning of the school ses
sion and examine each child suspected by the teachers
in charge. All those who show any signs of con
tagious or infectious disease, especially measles,
diphtheria, scarlet fever, croup, whooping cough,
mumps, contagious eye diseases, parasiftc diseases of
the head or body, or chicken pox, are at once ex
cluded from the school. Each pupil so excluded is
given a printed card, on which the reason for exclu
sion is noted. In the case of severe contagious dis
eases inspection at home follows within twenty-four
hours after exclusion from school."
By reason of this daily inspection the danger of the
spread of disease through the schools is greatly di
minished, and, in fact, virtually eliminated. The
health of the community is improved and the welfare
of the children thoroughly guarded. The system
', was put into force in New York in March. 1897, and
therefore been subjected to a thorough test. It
merits consideration here as well as on the Atlantic
*. and a similar routine of daily medical examina
tion might well be included among the improvements
! introduced into our schools under the new charter.
\\ AXV and various are r he lessons that have
I \ been drawn for the American people from the
course of the war between the British and the
Boers, but perhaps the most singular of them all is
one which the New York Press has put forward in the
mem that the ease with which the British have
transported an army corps to South Africa is a proof
that we need a larger army in the United States to
protect our country from military invasion.
The Press say> it Great Britain can pirt 50,000 men
ittth African soil in three weeks Germany can
put 100.000 men on North American soil in ten days.
It argues that Germany has now two great steamship
lines possessing ships that can carry 2500 men each
across the Atlantic in six and a half days, and that to
furnish a flotilla capable of transporting an army of
the size named to the United States within eight days
would not be too great a task for the German mer
chant marine.
Having thus stated the transportation problem our
contemporary goes on to say: "The two large army
corps nece-sary for such an expedition would impose
: rain on the resources of the German army, with
its peace footing of 562,000 men, or of France, with its
of 570.000. They would be, however, equal to
the entire United States army on a war foot
ing, regulars and volunteers. They would be
four times the peace strength of that army and more
than three times the strength of the force now avail
able, with 60,000 men in the Philippines and 10.000 in
The harbor defence?, rapidly and defectively
installed, mainly as a result <Â«f the war with Spain,
i have no part to play in ?uch operations. They
are designed to protect cities from attack by hostile
fleets. Invasion never strike- a fortified port. It seeks
some remote and undefended point on the seacoast.''
The Press conclude* by saying it has no desire to
alarm any one, but merely to direct attention to the
fact that we can no longer rely upon the ocean to
protect us from invasion, but must maintain a stand
ing army to defend ourselves. It is not likely the
menace thus depicted will be regarded by Americans
with much foreboding. If we are in such danger.
however, it would be better to guard against it by
increasing the navy rather than the army. Why wait
until the enemy has landed on our shores before we
â laughter him? Why not have a navy like that of
Great Britain, that can meet the invading flotilla on
the sea and demolish it there so as to avoid the ne
cessity of mussing our seaside resorts up with blood
and bones?
r( >R many years past American humorists have
suggested the existence of a type of man who
would like to own the earth and put a barbed
wire fence around it. It now appears the jest wai
at one time very near realization, and not in joke
either, but in the earnestnes, that is known as
"strictly business."
In his testimony before the Industrial Commission
John W. Gates, managing director of the American
Steel and Wire Company, stated that after the con
solidation of the big wire companies in this country
he went to Europe to effect an international combi
nation of all the wire manufacturers of the world. In
explaining why his plan failed of accomplishment he
is quoted as having said the German manufactnn r
first proposed that in case of an international consoli
dation the United States should be content with 25
per cent of the product. This he had declined, and
they afterward increased the allowance to 55 per cent.
He had to run away from Berlin to avoid accepting
this allowance. He had himself represented the pos
sibility of increasing prices to the extent of about
$10 per ton in ense of the proposed amalgamation,
but found that the Germans had in view an increase of
about $20 per ton.
The witness further declared lm combination has a
monopoly of barbed wire patent*. It has shut down
some of the mills that were running before the con
tion waa effected last January, but it still gives
employment to about .Vi.ooo men. His company sup
plies Great Rritain with about 60 per cent of the wire
used there, and ships abroad upward of 700 tons of
wire a day. The only competition in sight is that
which is maintained by Germany, and it is for that
reason he was eager to make the combination. It will
be seen we were very near to having a worM-pinllins
wire combination as a fact and not as a joke. The
imagination of the humorist is great, but it docs not
keep much ahead of the schemes of the modern trust
manager.

THANKSGIVING DATâ D., City.
The first Thanksgiving day held In this
country Is usually said to have been a
day appointed for that purpose in Feb
ruary, MB. At that date the colony at
Charlestown was reduced to the point of
starvation, when a vessel with supplies
arrived, and a day of public rcjolcin* and
thanksgiving wan ordered by the Gover
nor. In June. 1452. the colonies of Mas.
*aehi. Bay and Plymouth held a day
of thanksgiving on account of favorablo
measures for the colml^s pansed by tha
Privy Council of th King of England.
In iv; 3 and, IStX the annual Thanksgiving
day was appointed by national proclama
tion. Since thÂ»n tn* proclamation has
been issued annually by the President.
ONCE MORE THE CENTURY-J. 11.
R-. City. This correspondent write* "In
your Answers to Correspondents of Oc
tober 22 and November 13, It appears that
the next century will commence with the
Ist day of January, ISol. Is that not
wrong? With the 313t day of December,
1533, 00 years are completed, and January
1. 1900, will be the beginning of the new
century. la that right?" To both ques
tions the answer is "no." The answer
given in this department to other corre
spondents on the dates named were cor
rect. If J. H. R. will for a moment con
sider the fact that It takes 100 years to
complete a century he will discover that
the first century, which commenced with
the year 1, was not completed until th*
close of the year 100, consequently the sec
ond century did not commence until thÂ»
first day of th year 101. Following that
rule down the centuries, this department
is at a loss to discover how or by what
rule of figuring j. 11. R. arrives at the
conclusion 1300 years will have been com
pleted on the 31st day of December. 1599.
On that day ISS9 years will have been
completed. If the correspondent will do a
little figuring he will 1001 satisfy himself
that the twentieth century commences
with the year 1901.

Looks as if these $1.30 hats were going to be the
most popular hats we ever sold. You would think so
if you saw the big number we sold last Saturday. .
Giving such a value we expected that the hats
would sell, so we bought 1200, but it seems as if we
would have to duplicate the order soon.
Hats come in stiff and soft shapes in all the

Its value. This use of the land was per

was cut down to $42Ki 79.

of a dividend of 4 1-10 cents on the dollar

VALLEY ROAD'S BIG VIADUCT.
STEAM CRANE RAISING THE SUPPORTS OF THE NEW
BRIDGE.
WITHIN a few days the Valley road's big steel viaduct across tho
Alhambra Valley. Just back of Martinez, -will be finished. Thl*
structure Is the largest steel bridge In California, and the most
modern one of Its kind In the world.
At a first glance the new bridge looks very curiousâ for all the
world like a heavy beam laid across the top of a row of sticks.
And that Is ally the principle the engineers have been aiming at. because It
Is known that this embodies the strongest methods of building.
It Is 1680 feet across the Alhambra Valley whore the bridge crosses. The
first work was to put In the foundation for the upright supports of the bridge.
These consisted of nests of piles driven Into the ground thirty-two feet, and
on top of each sixteen feet of concrete, all being covered with a heavy cap of
granite. This work was done several months ago and allowed to harden, so
that when the heavy steel was placed In position It was as solid as the earth
Itself.
The main girders used In the bridge are each sixty feet long: and six feet
deep, being made of solid plates of steel. Each girder weighs ten tons. The
length of the posts varies from ten feet to eighty feet, the longest being quit*
close to the San Francisco end of the bridge. The roadway of the bridge Is
seven feet wide between the centers DX the girders.
Although the material used In the bridge Is of the heaviest kind. It h>
bandied with the greatest ease. Twelve hundred feet of the bridge Is now
finished, and tho work was all done in thirteen days by the Thompson Bridge
Company. Should all go well the work will be finished by next Monday or
Tuesday.
All the Iron and steel for the bridge are shipped to the site In sections,
ready to be bolted together. ... upright posts are bolted into a A shape i
piece. A rope from an enormous traveling crane on the bridge Is then made
fast to the upper md. and the plecv 111 led Into position. From the same
traveling crane one of the enormous girders Is run out to meet the posts and
the ends bolted together. A second girder is run out and bolted, and that sec
tion of the bridge Is complete. The work goes along so fast that it appears
like magic.
Kngineer Crcesfleld has been In charge of the steel work of the new bridge.
He cays It Is one of the smoothest pieces of work he has ever handled. Every
thing has gone along perfectly, and not a man has been hurt. And, best of ah.
the bridge as finished Is as solid as a rock. Not the least vibration can be de
tected, even when the crane Is at work raising one of the enormous pieces of
steel Into position.

DANGER FROM ACETYLENE.
Practical Illustration Given by Fire
Marshal Towe to the Fire Com
missioners.
Fire Marshal Towe at a meeting of the
Fire Commissioners yesterday afternoon
gave a practical illustration of the inflam
mable nature of calcium carbide, from
which acetylene gas is generated. It is
kept on sale in hardware stores and
cyclerles, and an ordinance based upon
the one In force In New York was adopted
by thÂ« Fire Committee at its mewling
Tuesday. The ordinance provides that th.
calcium carbide must be kept In tin re
ceptacles, ar.d not more than UÂ» pounds
can be kept In stock at one time. At
present one warehouse has as a rule two
carloads in stock.
The Fire Marshal took a small piece
about an Inch iquare and poured a little
cold water on it. The gas was immedi
ately generated and tne Fire Marshal
applied a lighted match to the gas, when
a large volume of flame shot out and
made the Commissioners tart back.
More water was poured on the flame and
it had the effect of spreading It Instead
of putting it out. It li thÂ«Â» greatest dan
ger that tlremon have to face.

GRE/\T AMERICAN STATESMEN.
VI. THOMAS JEFFERSON.
BY WILLIS M. WKST. M A.
Personal Characteristics and Early
Life.
Thomas Jeffr-rpon gave immortal torn
to the principles of our Revolution of IT7>'.

tin- popular Ide
i ant irit.rnal "revolution" ol If I I
by his election to th<- Presl 'â¢icy.
These are th<Â» two great facts that stand
out bold and clear against his eighty-thre"
years of varied activity. Lee or \
hight have penned a stately Dccl t
of Independence, but neither of them
could have made the document speak that
eloquent and Inspiring faith which was jÂ«o
"to shape the destinies of the v.
world" and "to educate mankind t
dom"; nor in the next generation was
there any other gr^at figure to stand forth
at once the prophet and the statesman
general of democracy and Americanism
against the aristocratic, pessimistic.
Europeanlzing proclivities of the mass of
intellectual leaders in that day.
Like Jackson and Llncodn later, he
stands for a new typeâ this first Ameri
can. His engaging personality is I
be portrayed by bold strokesâ only by de'.l
cate pencilings. These fine phadlngs of
character seemed, of course, to i
critics to imply hypocrisy or wku
and he was necessarily misunderstood by
his adversaries- this Intellectual ari-
and apostle of social democracy; this the
orist of wildest Ideals, but most astute
politician upon all Immediate practical
problems; this shy man, averse to con
flict, but a popular dictator. Naturally
Federalist pamphleteers found much â¢ r
out at, even had they not descended to
that mire of filth and falsehood with
which the slk-nt Jefferson was 1
tered as Is never any public man In our
better-mannered era. In person Jefferson
was tallâ 6 fer-t 21;2 1 ; Inchesâ of vigorous but
loose-Jointed frame, with sandy hair and

irreg^ir, freckled, sunny face. He was
an athletic, reckless horseman, the friend
of science and philosophy, an enthusiastic
farmer, a man of universal Interests, the
valued correspondent of the most famous
savants of Europe. It is not hard to pic
ture him, by the description of contem
poraries, sitting humped up on one hip,
with neglected dress and slippers down at
the heel, talking Incessantly with ram
bling charm, or with methodical industry
with his ready pen recording minutest
weather details, drawing up a neat table
to show the dates of the appearance of
thirty-seven select vegetables In the
"Washington markets during his residence
there, reporting Judicial decisions, devis
ing rules for parliamentary procedure, di
recting with gentlest suggestion the poll
tics of a distant State, discussing with
French or English celebrity the latest dis
covery in science or Inditing some other
form of that voluminous and delightful
correspondence which well earns for the
author the title of the greatest American
letter writer.
Jefferson was born In 1713 upon the
estate to which he waa to give tne name
Montlcello (little mountain). The earliest
American Jefferson, of the English yeo
man class, sat In the first representative
assembly upon this continent In Kl9; and
on his mother's side Jefferson was de
scended from one of the proudest cavalier
families. His education at William and
Mary College was as good as America af
forded. Though still young, he practiced
law with eminent success and was rap-
Idly augmenting his private fortune when
he was called into public service, which
was to occupy his next forty years.
Early Revolution â The Declara-
tion of Independence.
Already in 1763 the youth of 22 had lis
tened with ardent sympathy from the
doorway while his older friend, Henry, in
that most bloody debate, a? Jefferson
styled it. against "all the cyphers of the
aristocracy! "rang the alarm bell for the
continent." Four years later Jefferson
himself appears in the Assembly, and
when that body Is shortly dissolved be
cause of Its generous protest against Eng
land's treatment of Massachusetts, he Is
one of the deputies who assemble at the
Raleigh tavern under the lead of Wash
ington to form that early non-importation
league. In 1773 he was named upon the
tlrst Virginia Intercolonial Correspond
ence Committee, when his colony inaugu
rated that most Important plan for united
action. During the next two stormy
yenrs we Fee him drafting Important state
papers, chairman of committee of safety
for hi? county and delegateto the various
revolutionary provincial conventions, un
til In 1775 he appears at Philadelphia as a
member of the second Continental Con
gress.
Reforms in Virginia and War Gover-
nor.
The next year Jefferson is back In the
Virginia Assembly. He hail written to
Franklin regarding the new Btal consti
tution that "th. people seem to have laid
nside monarchical and taken up republican
government with as much ease as would
have attended their throwing off an old
and putting on â¢ new suit of clothes."
Hut the change was not yet realized or
completed, and during 177<-7S. in all the
turmoil of war, Virginia was to have an
Internal social revolution of her own by
legislation. The contest was only less
bitter than that in thu field, and Jeffer
son's work might easily have filled out the
fame of a smaller man. He was the ac
know!' and almost sole leader of the
radical reform party, which finally swept
away the church establishment with every
check upon religious freedom, the old
semi-feudal aristocracy with its bulwark*
of entail and primogeniture, and the com
plex barbarities of the old legal system
for a marvelous!)- simple, compact, hu
mane code. Jefferson's victory Ameri
canized Virginia and consolidated in that
State the Democratic j>a%y he was soon
to organize for the nation at large
His alms were even more generous and
far-reaching than these great results The
effort to provide for gradual emancipa
tion was poorly rewarded by the restric
tion actually secured upon further Impor
tation of slaves Into the State: and the
noble attempt to establish a compete
State system of education from primary
schools to nnJvenitr. too far In advMca
of the age for any part of America then,
bore no .rult on thÂ»> unfavorable soil ot
Vt.-Kl.' though Jffferaon w.-ui to recur
to the 4lroam tagcrly In the leisure of iUa
latest yearn.
From this congenial worÃ J<f?erson was
called to Kerve a* Governor for thu two
terms 1779. 17S0. It was to be a dUtnwÂ»>
Ing period for the State. Virginia had
generously orainnl h.r?. If of men. horÂ«eÂ»
and arms fur the <â .-:..â¢.; continental ar
mlf-s. Now. nakfd ami OefenMlna, sno
was herself crutlly and repeatedly hur
rltd by Arnold and Tark-ton. Under tuch
conditioni the Governor of course re
ceived much unmerited censure*; but.
however cjol and courageous. Jefferson
certainly lacked the decisive energy anu
Intuitive Insight of a commander In chkr,
and this part of his life Justly caused
him deep chagrin. At the same time he
was assailed by private grlefrf. His prop
erty was luthle^^ly and wantonly de
stroyed by British troopers; his only non.
an Infant, died Just after the family
flight, and Boon afterward his wife fell
Into that long and fatal Illness In which
Jefferson nursed her with touching Â».nd
loving care.
In 1783 Jeffemon Is again In the Con
gress of the confederation. In these tew
months ho secured for us our sensible
decimal money notation, though his plan,
for a complete metric system of weigh:*
and measures unfortunately failed then
and afterward; and he had the gratifica
tion of presenting to Congress Virginia's
noble cession of her Imperial dom.ita
north of Ohio. Fitly, toeâ and the most
Important event of this second term la
Congressâ it _f>ll to JefT(?rson to preparo
the first ordinance for the organization,
of this new- national Territory which wan
to be the model for the later more fa
mous Northwest ordinance of 1757, and.
I Indeed, for all our subsequent territorial
I organization.
Strangely suggestive to see Jefferson,
soon to be the founder of the great Dem
ocratic party, already In 17S1. In this first
attempt to restrict the area of slavery
anticipating the platform upon which
was to M the rival Republican party
seventy years later! ,

secured a nrm^r
hold, but his de
voted admiration of
France by no mean*
weakened his pa
triotism. He urg^d
Monroe to come tÂ»Â»
France, because "it
will make you adore
your own country.

laws, people ami
manners," and ha
pr â¢dlc tc d that.
though many Euro
peans would settlo
in America, no man
living would see an
American seek a
home in Europe. Mo
watched the early
stances of the
French rev oletion
with keenest Inter
est, and. while irre
proachably preserv
ing the neutrality of
a foreign Minister,
he was in private
the valued adviser
of Lafayette and
other ardent reform
ers, whose unpracti
cal plans he not in
frequently helped to
moderate.
In 17Â» he returned
to America and be
came Washington's
Secretary of State.

No doubt much chaff, mingled with Jef
rerson s sounder political doctrine His
rantastlc aversion to titles like "honora
ble and to "monarchic" celebrations of
February 22 (he kept his own birÂ»tulay
secret;: his foolish idea that all public
debt and legislation should expire with
the enacting generation; his vicious drca.l
of strong government, which led him to
draw the mischievous Kentucky resolu
tionsâa 1 these are to be regretted. But
after all. these are trifling blots upon his
wise larger hopes for mankind and for
America as "the world's best hope"â a
creative faith which contrasted so fortu
nately with the despair of the Federal
ists, to whose short sight their country
men s Ideals appeared only sordid ami
meanâ and certainly the victory of liw)
as has been Justly said, does mark tho
resumption of the progress toward de
mocracy and Americanization which had
been interrupted the preceding twelve
years.
The purchase of Louisiana completed
Jefferson's popularity. In the darkest
days of the revolution he had encouraged
Clark's heroic Invasion of the British
Northwest, and his one satisfactory act
as war Governor had been the holding and
organizing the territory so conquered tin
had already taken keen Interest also In
the exploration of the distant Oregon
country, and it was poetically right that
this new territory, doubling the national
area, should be jrt-quirrd by the man who
more than any statesman of the day had
enthusiastic faith In the west and lxi our
expansion over the continent.
The long public career seemed about to
close In n blaza of glory. Opposition at
home was silenced or annihilated. But
clouds of humiliation were gathering from
Kurope. Kngland and Napoleon, again it
war. were each bent upon drawing the
nÂ«"w republic In train. Jefferson, with h's
pacific disposition and his ideal of peaco
for the American continent, clung to a
neutrality even after hla country became
common sport of the two arrogant rob
bers. No American can read the story
without a blush. The s failure ns war Gov
ernor was repeated on a larger scale and
Jefferson sadly escaned In ISO 3 from the
disgraceful failure of his fort !gn policy to
hs retreat at montlcello for the r"st of
hiÂ« day*. But his weakness was forgotten

The harbor matter is one that is caus

an enviable one. The town of A!. mil da

differ materially from those held by Ala

Mr. Metcalf introduce a resolution into
Congress asking thai all matters In con

the Hoard of Trade has been submitted
to Congressman Metcalf, with a request
that he act upon it.
Mr/ Metcalf has not yet committed him

BERLIN. Nov. 23.â Tho trial was besun
here, to-day of Max Schlemaugk, who de
scribes himself as a former major of
United States volunteers, on charges of
obtaining money under false pretenses.
Evidence was produced showing that the

served as a private In the German army
until 11*9. and committed many dishonest
actions, In view of his claim thai he was
elected a major of United States volun
teers during the Spanish-American war,
the court endeavored to And in Berlin
some person reliably informed regarding
the American militia system. This at
tempt proved unsuccessful. The Judge
sent for Count yon Goetzen, former mili
tary attache to the German embassy In
Washington, who was commissioned by
Kmperor William to accompany the Amer
ican troops during the war for purposes
of observation and official report. The
Count, however, said that the American

nERLIK. Nov. 23.â Investigation Bhows
that the facts In the Cameroon ncandal
made public by the Tageblatt November
I s . when that paper said an apparently
corrupt deal had taken place by which tae
chief of the Colonial Department gave
uwuy 10,000 square kilometres of. Cameroon
aoll. estimated to be worth about 40,
marks, to various high personages, far
exceeds the Tageblatt story. The pro
moters, It appears, first formed a company
and soon sold out to a new company
fornud at Brussels, and made up of Bel
gluns. Englishmen and several Americans,
for 18,500,000 francs. The concession. It
prtber ;ij. pears, really cost them noth
ing. IHe t:rn company was named In the
concession Sudekameron. Prime Hohen
lohe-Oerhingen was one of the original
concessioners. For this reason the Em
peror forced his resignation as chief court
chamberlain.
The facts in the most recent grant of a
concession are even worse. To a company
called the Nordw^st-Kanierun a territory
was . onceued larger than Uavaria. It lies
In the Hinterland of the Camerouns, Is ex
tremely fertile and Includes valuable for
worth a thousand times the obliga
tions the company assume* toward tne
c-n.plre. The entire financial obligation Is
only a 100,0)0 marks' contribution to the
:"'-!iad Luke expedition, while
there are other undertakings to spend
5.000.0U0 marks within ten years in im
â¢ meats of the tracts, to cot.
: . steamer lines, plantations and fac
all redounding to the benefit of tin
company. The concession was granted for
fifty years, which is to be extended for
sixty years more If the company within
twelve years constructs a railroad
coastwise.
v the expiration of the Becond term the
Immense tract becomes the company's
property absolutely. The company also
agrees to pay the Government a small
share of Its profits. There is no provision
that the company or a majority of its
shareholder* must be Germans.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns from the Colonial Office in
explanation of the above that the present
chief, I>r. yon Buchka, adopted the Brit
ish policy nf retting big moneyed syndi
cates to t:.ke bold of the colonies on the
prospect of Inrge profits. It Is understood
that the whole aitalr will be thoroughiV
ventilated In the RÂ« lohstag, and that Dr.
vnn Buchka's days as an official are
probably numben-<l.

WILL MARK THE
PASSING OF THE
OLD POSTOFFICE
Main Postal Business
to Migrate.
The mors-grown old postofflee on Wash
ington street will soon be deprived of the
greater part of its business. While it may
remain for a time. In name, the general
postofflee for the city, it will do no more
business than a station, which It will be In
fact. Tho registry department will go to
the ferry to Station D. The railway mail
service will setk the same location. After
much negotiation and the exercise of me
diplomacy on the part of Harbor Commis
sioner Kilburn, who has been talking with
the United States postal authorities and
others, an assignment of space near the
foot of Market, street has been reached
which Is satisfactory to the Federal Gov
ernment. Not much longer will Station D
be situated In the ferry building. A large
structure will be erected south of the fer
ry building for the postal station, with tho
following dimensions on the ground: East
street front, % feet; total length. 232 feet;
width In the rear, C 7 feet I Inches.
That this move has been contemplated
has been kept as secret as possible. In
fact, tho matter has not . been finally
closed, but an agreement has been practi
cally reached and the final disposition of
the proposition will be made to-day, when
Post.'il Inspector Munro and the Harbor
Commissioners will meet. The. plan for
the structure has been submitted to the
Postolllce Department at Washington and
has met with favor. Postmaster Mon
tnguo la pleased with It; so are the em
ployes of the postal service In this city.
The first consideration that arose was the
amount of rent to be paid for the Ftatinn
to the Harbor Commissioners, It was
agreed by the Commissioners that there
should be no Increase over the price paid
for the presnt space In and back of the
ferry depot. That was entirely satisfac
tory to the Federal Government. When
the site for the new building was dJÃ
cussed the postal people were not satis
fied to go south of the ferry depot. On
second thought they were pleased with the
location, because It Insured them plenty
of room, plenty of light and freedom from
annoying Interruptions, which have trou
bled them in the roar of the ferry depot.
Where teams have been constantly passing
between Station D and the dispatching de
partment on the wharf.
The new building will come within
twelve feet of the electric car tracks on
East street, and will extend back farther
east than the ferry building. It will be of
Irregular shape. Part of it will be two
stories highâ tho front portion. The back
will be only one story nigh. The greater
part of the second story win be occupied
by the railway mail service. Practically
all other departments will bo on ihe
â round floor. Borne definite Idea of Its size
may be gathered from the Statement that
the ground floor will cover 15.394 square
feet, and the upper floor WOO foot. About
one-third only will be two Stories high.
This arrangement will leave the ferry
depot to the v.so of the railroad companies,
the ferry service and Wells-Fargo s Ex
press. As soon as the postal matter Is
finally fixed up the assignment of space
to the transportation lines will be made.
IMans have been submitted to the Santa
IV. but they are not made public pending
final decision. The express company will
probably remain In Its present location,
using tho dolphin, which has been jointly
occupied with the postal station. There
will be little delay In beginning the new
postal building. A structure Is on the site,
but It will be removed. One advantage
which the postal people will have, that
they have not heretofore enjoyed, will be
a driveway around all sides of the station.
Thin will facilitate the receipt and dis
patching of malls appreciably In point of
time. _
Pioneers' Reception.

staff, and she so managed things that each Individual be
lieved himself to be next. For Mrs. Wolfe Miss Ander
son professed a tender attachment, leading tho landlady
to believe that whtn the next remittance came the two
would buy and run the Palace Hotel.
In other words, Miss Anderson had the landlady hyp
notized, atirt despite tho fact that the star boarder's bill
was rapidly mounting Skyward MrrÂ». Wolfe was fearful
of Introducing the silver question. The press of financial
uts. however, compelled her to broach a few
days SCO the matter of a partial payment of the bill, and
Anderson gave her landlady another story about
v from home am! the uncertainty of the malls.
Several days later Miss Anderson failed to show for
meals at the boarding house and Mrs. Wolfe began to
fear that something had happened to her. Not a doubt
a.Â» to the good Intentions of Miss Anderson entered the
landlady's mind until a big man went to the boarding
r the late star boarder's trunk. Mrs. Wolfe pro
tested against its nmoval. but she wai small, and when
he left all she had to remember Miss Anderson by was
an empty <h'Ur in the dining room.
That's why she swore out a warrant yesterday charg
ing : A rson with defrauding an Innkeeper. The
accused woman was arrested a! : . r.g house
and later on her own recognizance by Police

NOVEL LAW POINT.
Can a Boy of Eighteen Enlist Legally
Without His Parents' Consent?
A nice point of law came up yesterday
in the United States District <"ourt in thÂ«
matter of the application of Mrs. Marian
.1 Norton for a writ of habeas corpus to
recover possession of her son, Eugene L.
Norton, who enlisted without her c
on tho United States steamer Pensaoota.
lulled States Attorney Ombs raised
the point that as the testimony showed
DETECTIVES WORK ON
CLEWS OF SUPPOSED MURDER
THE discovery of the body of an unknown man In a vacant lot on "Wal
ler stieet, between Stelner and Flllmore, furnished material for a good
<l't'< tlvo case and created a Btlr In police circles yesterday. It wai be
lieved that an unfortunate party had been murdered, but through the
efforts of Metectlve George McMahon, who was given charge of the case, the
mystery was Â«-xploded, and there remains now little doubt that the man's
death whs accidental.
The boÂ«ly was found early yesterday morning by Chris Claussen of 118
Steiner street, and was taken to the Morgue.
In the Jim ki-ts of the dead man were found a flmall purse containing a
rusty key and a printed business card of H. 1,. Qoggtatf drug store. 904 J
â tltel, Sacrumento, "represented by Ed T. Naghel." Around the neck was a
Roman Catholic Hcapular, and fastened to the inside of the vest was a medal
of the League of the Barred Heart, a Roman Catholic Boclety.
The position of the body ami the fact that there were no marks of violence
HCOapt a flight bruise on the scalp above the right ear, which It was thought
was due to a fall, led to the belief that death had been caused by apoplexy or
heart disease. The body was placed on a slab and marked "unidentified." At
4 o'clock an autopsy was made by Morgue Surgeon Zab.ila, and he found that
the ukull Just under the contusion near the right ear was fractured, and that
death was caused by the fracture.
The deceased was about 45 or 50 years old. five feet nine Inches tall and
weighing about 150 pounds. He was dressed In a dark cassimere sack suit,
with uheap working trousers and No. 7 congress gaiters. Hl* hair and mustache
were brown, nprinkled with gray, and there was about a week's growth of
beard on the face. The eyes were blue, the chin pointed and the nose flat, as
though It had been brok<n.
Detective McMahon ascertained that two boys, Edwin Young of 70 Waller
street and George White-head of 214 Steiner street, had found the man lying
on the sidewalk about 8 o'clock on Wednesday evening in an intoxicated can
dltlon, and sat him up against the side of a building. Several other people
claim to have seen an Intoxicated man wandering around their neighborhood
after the time the boys say they found their man. and others heard him
rroanlng. The witnesses were John James and wife and Mrs. F. C. Mart
of 417 Waller street and a grocer named Schroder who resides at 611 Hayes
street. None of the witnesses saw the Intoxicated man In company with any
one.
Near where the boys say they picked up the Intoxicated man a small clot
of blood was found. It Is now the theory of the police that the man while
drunk fell on the sidewalk, fracturing hiÃ skull, and then wandered to the
vacant lot. where he expired from bis Injuries as well as exposure. No one
has thus far identified the body.
that the youth wns more than 18 years
old his enlistment, according to ti
of <'ongress. was legal, and that his pa
rents were not entitled to the writ.
Bert Bchlesinger, attorney for Mrs. Nor
ton, argued that n.n the boy, "this mere
child, your Honor." was riot yet 21 years
old. ho was under the care and control of
his parents and he could not enlist legally
without their consent.
Judge <1Â«- Haven continued the further
hearing of the case until next Monday,
and Intimated that United States Attor
ney Coombs' point was good law.

TWO STEAMERS
TO TAKE AWAY
THE FORTIETH
The Recruit Camps
Cleaned Out.
The transports Ohio and Indiana got
away from the Government wharf last
night. The Ohio has aboard six coinp.m
ies of the Fortieth Infantry and the
quarters and baud. The men are under
command of Colonel Goodwin. Lieutenant
James F. Me Klnley, a nephew of the
President, was also a pa*Â»enger on the
Ohio. Ue la connected with the Sixth
Cavalry, and will report to General Young
on hi* arrival at Manila as General
Young's aid.
The Indiana carried the remaining six
companies of the Fortieth and 10u recruits,
all under command of Major Craighlll.
General Funntun was a passenger on the
Indiana, and he also will rÂ«-p'Â»rt for duty
on his arrival In the Philippine*.
There was no excitement at all attend
ing Uie departure of the troops. The
usual number of the curious were down
to see the men away, but outside of them
little Interest was taken In the departure
of the troopships.
This leaves only the Forty-second and
the Forty-ninth at the Presidio and the
Forty-eighth at the detention camp at
Angel Island. The Forty-second will get
away about the S7th inst., and the other
two will be away about December 12 if
nothing happens to delay the Forty
eighth. Latent reports from the camp,
however, show a total of eight emm of
smallpox developed in the regiment since
It went into quarantine, ana unless the
development ot other cases ie stopped the
regiment will have to hang on until
Christmas. It will have to remain until
two weeks alter the discovery of the last
Case of smallpox, and if they keep crop
ping up the men will have to stay over
there an Indefinite time.
The Presidio has been cleaned out of
recruits as well as regiments, for by the
Ohio are going all that were in the camps
and tit for service. There are but a few
left who are on the sick list, but there l.Â«
not an able-bodied recruit not on his way
to Manila.
News from the detention camp at the
Presidio shows five eases and one suspect.
At first there were three cases and three
suspects, but two of the suspects have
been taken down with the disease and
the case of the third suspect Is .still a
matter of doubt.
1 lie K.Tty-second Infantry Is short
eighteen men, and yesterday Lieutenant
Colonel Beacom, Who Is In command, re
ceived authority to accept recruits from
here. There are also Jive vacancies in the
band, and these, too, he will endeavor to
till before he leaves for the Philippines.
He will try to rÂ«crult his regiment right
here in the city, and all applicants for
service will be examined at the wimp of
the command.
Acting Assistant Surgeon O. W. Woods
was assigned to thf> transport Indiana
just before she sailed. He has been as
nlgned to the Victoria, to sail from Seat
tle, but he did not receive his orders In
time to report.
First Lieutenant Prank E. Harris, Third
Artillery, has been relieved from duty as
quartermaster and commissary of the
camp of volunteers at the Presidio. Out-
Bide of the tearing down of the tents this
is about the last official act in the abo
lition, of the volunteers' camps, as they
have been known.
W. Frank Cloeckner sntled for Manila
