PARIS ANARCHISTS IN
BATTLES WITH POLICE
Rioters Sack a Church in the French Capital and
Attack Priests With Knives.
Sanguinary Encounters Between the Authorities and Armed Mobs
of Socialists Continue Throughout the Sabbath and
Far Into the Night*
J^)ARIS, 'Aug. 20. â Paris was
J[ to-day the scene of most
serious disturbances, recall
ing some aspect of the Commune.
In response to an appeal of the Jour
nal Dv Feuple and La Petit Re
fublique groups of anarchists and
socialists gathered at about 3
*> 'clock in the afternoon in the Place
-de la Republiquc. The police had
taken precautions and there seemed
mo danger of disorders.
Sebastian Faure and Faberol,
well-known revolutionary anarch
ists, were the ringleaders. Faure,
standing on the pedestal of the
â¢statue which rises in the center of
the Place de la Repubhque, ad
dressed the crowd. Among other
things he said the anarchists should
be masters of the streets. The po
lice then interfered and dislodged

The police broke through the col
umn, and a struggle for the mastery
followed. Shots were tired, and M.
Goullicr, Commissary of Police,
was twice stabbed with a knife.
This threw the police into mo
mentary confusion. The mob re
assembled and ran toward the Place
dc la Nation. The police, rein
forced by a squad that had . been
held in reserve, made another at

fresh, fierce fighting occurred, three

traced their course to the Place de
la Republique, smashing the win
dows of religious edifices on the
way.
Suddenly, eitlter at the word of
command or in obedience to the im
pulse, the cohwin made a loop and
curved toward the Church of St.
Ambroise, where tlw rioters
smashed the windows. Proceeding
thence toward the Faubourg dv
Temple, at the comer of Rue d'Ar
boy and the Rue St. Mauri-Popin-
court, they formed up into a com
pact body. Hatchets were suddenly
produced, with long knives, stolen
from the counters of shops, and a
j concerted rush teas made upon the
Church of St. Joseph. The aged
sacristan, seeing the mob, hastily
closed the outer gates, but these were
| soon forced with hatchets and bars
of iron. The massive oaken doors
were then attacked. According to
the first account the wild horde burst
into the church, which instantly be
came a scene of pillage and sacri
lege. Altars and statues were
hurled to the floor and smashed;
! pictures were rent, candlesticks, or
naments and hosts from high altars
Ztfere thrown down and trampled
under foot. The crucifix above was
made the target for missiles, and
: the figure of the Savior was frac
j hired in several places.
Then, while rancorous voices
\ sang the "Carmagnole," the chairs
were carried outside, piled up and
set on fire in the center of the
square fronting tlie church.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 1899.
When this stage was reached the
crucifix was pulled down and
â¢ thrown into the flames. Suddenly
i the cry was raised that the statue
1 of the virgin had been forgotten,
and the crowd returned and tore
this down also.
Meanwhile the sacristan, who
had been captured by the anarch
ists, escaped and called the police
and republican guards, who\
\ promptly answered with many con
| stables. They were compelled to
\ fall back in order to form up into
I line of defense, as the anarchists
attacked them' with knives.
At length the officers began to\
gain the fnastery. A score of an- j
arckists took refuge in an adjacent \
house. Others intrenched them- l
I selves in the belfry and fiercely de- J
I fended themselves by showering
missiles on the republican guards,
\ but finally these were dislodged.
Twenty anarchists were arrested,
taken to the police station, searched,
and found to be carrying revolvers,
loaded sticks and knives.
When the police entered the
church the anarchists had just sct\
tire to the pulpit. The interior of \
the edifice was a complete wreck. j
Several valuable old pictures that
can never be replaced were ruined.
After the mob had been driven
away, Aobe Lacour, the incumbent, â 
collected the fragments of the sac- \
rament and replaced them in the I
ciborium. As he did so he was
heard bitterly lamenting. The pco- \
pic living in the houses near by ex- I
tmguished the bonfire.
From 8 o'clock until midnight the
demonstrators so far as Garc de
I'Est, were repeatedly driven back
by police charges, the crowd crying, j
"Vive I'Armee" and "Vive la Rc
publique."
The police also dispersed a crowd
of gamins ivho 7vere burning bun

SUDDENLY WAKES
At the Eleventh Hour He|
Shows a Disposition to
Usurp Citizens' Com
mittee's Power.
GRACELESS GOVERNOR j
GAGE, aided and abetted by j
his asinine mouthpiece. Ad- j
jutant General Seamans, has |
once, more given the people crt j
California incontrovertible, if not un- !
necessary, proof: of his piggish nature ;
and brutal disregard for the rights of \
others. . At the same time, he has ex
hibited . a wealth of ignorance of the
duties, powers and privileges of his |
exalted position, as remarkable as it is j
lamentable. That the unspeakable
Seamans would clutch every oppor- |
tunity to display his asinine proclivi- |
ties was predicted by The Call at the
time of his appointment, but that he
would be permitted by his official I
creator to disturb the peace of the com- j
monwealth by wigwagging his ears
and emitting his discordant bray upon
a great public occasion like the recep
tion to the California volunteers, was
beyond the ken of any intelligent
citizen.
With an Insulting effrontery that
would shame the most shameless ward
heeler on the staff of his political j
partner and master, Burns, Governor j
Gage yesterday dispatched his creature ;
Seamans to the citizens' executive com- j
mittee with a peremptory demand to j
turn over to him the direction of the \
reception to the brave sons of Califor
nia. He demanded in effect that the I
citizens' committee, which % has accu- I
mulated a fund of over $50,000 and per- j
fected plans for a magnificent reception !
to the country's defenders, should step
aside and allow him to pose, in the full
glare of public admiration, as- the |
"Great I Am." the man to. whom all
credit for the assured success, of the
great manifestation of Joy and honor
was s.rlely due. . ; " </
And this is the man who has hereto

difference to- all that has been done;
who. has refused to proclaim the day
set apart for the celebration in honor
of the returning soldier boys a legal
holiday. He steps in at the last moment
and seeks to cast a cloud over the fes
tivities unless he is recognized and I
bowed down to as the great mogul
whose word is law and must be obeyed.
When Seamans obtruded "his off ensi . c
personality upon the citizens' execu
tive committee yesterday afternoon,
and presented Gage's demands, the
members of that body were stupefied
with astonishment and sat In their
chairs mute and dazed, while the adju
tant general of the State swelled and
strutted and voiced the dictum of his
master. When they finally recovered

their power of speech they advanced to
the attack with a vehemence that
caused the ass's ears on the puppet
J before them to droop and his chest to
collapse like a punctured toy balloon.
He entered the room with the bearing
of a dime novel conqueror and opened
| his campaign of words with a pompous
i bluster that seemed to his self-esteem
to permit of no denial of his demands.
He retired discomfited and demoralized
and in a condition bordering closely
upon physical and mental collapse.
The committee informed him that if
Governor Gage participated in the fes
tivities he would do so as the guest of
the people of San Francisco and not as
their master; that he would not be
to dictate in the management.
GENERAL SHAFTER'S PLAIN STATEMENT.
\ \ T HEN the California Voluteers return from Manila and are
tJ\l landed in San Francisco," said General Shafter, last night,
"they will be under but one jurisdiction â that of the United States
military laws. Until they are mustered out the general laws pre
scribed for all United States soldiers will apply to them as well as
to the regulars. When they became United States soldiers they lost
their identity as members of the National Guard of this State. Un
less the California boys re-enter the National Guard they will never
come under the military power of the Governor of the State. After
two or three weeks in this city they will then be mustered out. The
moment this happens they are no longer soldiers, but 'private citi
zens.
"In the strict letter ot the law the return of the California
Volunteers is no different from that of any other volunteer regi
ment, other than the fact that this is their home. I realize that the
few weeks which they will pass in camp are only for the purpose of
shaping affairs toward the final mustering out. As they are not to
remain in the service when this is accomplished they will be ac
corded every possible liberty and freedom. Their camp duties will
be of the most meager kind and no binding restrictions will be
placed upon their movements."
; either of the big naval Darade on the
bay or of the military parade on shore;
that he would, in fact, have no voice
whatever in the arrangements for the
! celebration, although he would at the
â  same time be shown every courtesy due
him as Governor of the State.
Previous to his disastrous assault on
the committee Seamans sought an in
terview with John D. Spreckels, com
modore of the fleet, and in charge of the
arrangements of the bay parade. With
! this object in view he called at the San
Francisco Club and there met "W. S.
Leake, representing Mr. Spreckels, to
whom he made a demand similar in
every respect to that which later he
presented to the executive committee,
but necessarily more limited in its
scope.
"As the representative of the Gov
ernor of California," began this choice
specimen of what a military official
; should not be. "I demand to know what
: position has been assigned him in the
' naval parade. I see by the papers
| that the State tug Governor Markham
! has been assigned to a certain position
lin the line. I see also, by the press re
ports, that the Governor's tug is to tow
a yacht.
"The programme must be changed.
The Governor has been invited by Sen
ator Perkins to meet the transport as
his guest on the steamer Santa Rosa,
on which will be Federal officers and
members of the Legislature. This in
vitation the Governor declined, stating
that he had already made arrange
. >TfirTi*f~--4**Z(pkf: rtftln* 1 1 -? jja.""tj^r of -friends
6n\ the State tugs Governor Markham
and Governor Irwin."
"But the State tugs have been placed
at the disposal of the citizens' commit
tee by the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners," said Mr. Leake.
"The Governor has ordered the tugs
for his personal use," declared Seamans
pompously, "and the citizens' commit
tee has nothing to do with them.
"Now the Governor, while not com
plaining of the position assigned him in
the line, asks that the Santa Rosa, on
which will be the members of the Leg
islature, be placed in line following his
tug." â¢
"That will be impossible," replied Mr.
Leake, "as no large steamers will be al
lowed to get in line or approach close to
the transport on account of the danger
of a collision."
"Well," continued Seamans, waxing
wroth, "the Governor does not propose
to remain in line and he does not pro
pose to tow a yacht. The arrange
ments will have to be changed."
The adjutant general was quietly in
formed that Commodore Spreckels had
completed his arrangements and would
not be likely to change them to suit the
whim of the Governor.
"But the Governor intends to run
alongside the Sherman and extend a |
greeting to the volunteers," puffed the
now thoroughly exasperated Seamans. I
"He cannot remain in line, and, sir, it
is absolutely essential â absolutely es
sentiaJ, sir, that I, as adjutant general j
of California, should confer with Colo
nel Duboce at the earliest opportunity
In order to arrange for the landing: of
the volunteers and for the street pa
rade."
The prepondering Idea of the ad
jutant general, and the one he was ap
parently most anxious in his ignorant
egotism to make prominent, was that
the California volunteers are still a
branch of the militia organization of
the State, and as such subject to the
authority of Governor Gage as com
mander-in-chief, from the moment they
landed in San Francisco.
"That has already been provided for
by the citizens' committee," said Mr.
Leake, "and neither you nor the Gover
nor vill have anything to do with it.
Moreover, if the Governor participates
in the naval parade he must take the
position assigned to him and retain it,
and I do not think he will be allowed to
run alongside the transport. His tug
has been assigned to tow a yacht, as
has every other tug that will appear in
the parade, a matter that has been
rendered necessary on account of the
great number who desire to witness the
spectacle and join in the first welcome
to the volun .eers."
"But I tell you, <Â»ir, the Governor will
rot * ke a tow."
"Very well," replied Mr. Leake, "if
the Governor objects to his towing a
yacht and if he objects to the place as
signed to him in the parade, I suggest
that he had better remain on shore or
i take a cruise by himself. If he goes
, in the para ie he will go as a guest of
I the committee and must conform to
I the rules laid down."
Seamans continued to expostulate
and was sharply informed that Gover
nor Gage was hrrdly in a position to
appear at this late day and dictate as
to the arrangements for the reception
oif th<e volunteers.
"The committee has addressed sev
eral communications to the Governor,"
said Mr. Leake, "and he has not
deigned to answer them. He has re
fused to -"-oclaim a holiday on the oc
casion of the celebration and he has
studiously avoided extending the cus
tomary courtesies to the Governors of
other States who have visited San
Francisco to welcome their troops dur
' ing the past few weeks. Instead of re-
maining here an<* attending to these
matters he has been down at CataJina
Island or some other place doing poli
tics with Dan Burns and a lot of touts.
"He has contributed nothing to the
success of the proposed celebration,
either by word or deed, but now, at the
last minute, he seeks to upset all ar
rangements of those who have made
success possible and project himself to
the front in order that he may be the
central figure in the festivities. This
celebration is a celebration by the peo
ple of San Francisco, and is being paid
for by them. The Governor has not
even accepted the invitation extended
to him by the committee to participate
in the land and naval parade, and I j
would like to know by what right hÂ«j

presume to interfere at this lat<Â» day?"
Seamans almost choked with """rath
while he listened to the merciless scor
ing of his master, hut he finally man
aged to stammer:
"Governor Gage is commander in
chief of the military forces of the P*ate
and has a right to a voice In the direc
tion of celebrations in which the militia
of the State is to take part."
He then said the Governor, with his
valuable assistance, had prepared a
programme which he desired followed,
but Mr. Lieake declined to look at it and
Mr. Martin, who was present, invited
him to appear before the committee.
After his warm reception by that
body Seamans did not venture to offer
his "programme." He was asked to do
so just before leaving .the room in
which the committee met, but the
starch had been taken out of him, and
he hesitatingly said he had no pro
gramme, but had simply jotted down a
few lines for reference.
He did have a programme and it con
sisted of a complete outline of the land
celebration, line of march, officers in
charge of the various divisions and all
other details, and he came before the
committee with the firmly expressed
determination of demanding its substi
tution for that prepared by the commit
tee. That he did not do so proved he
feared the eruption he knew would fol
low.
As an illustration of the utter Incom
petence of the adjutant general of the
State, as well as his insufferable arro
gance, he informed the citizens' execu
tive committee that Major Generil
Dickinson had no authority to order
out the militia of San Francisco with
out his (Seamans') consent. In answer
to a query put by Mayor Phelan as to
whether General Dickinson, who with
GeneraJ Shafter, has charge of the
military parade, did not command the
militia in this section, he swelled out
his chest and replied:
"Next to me, sir! Next to me."
Adjutant GeneraJ Seamans will bump
up against a tough proposition if he
attempts to interfere with that parade.
General Shafter has informed Grand
Marshal Pistolesi that he proposes to
run the military parade and will brook
no interference. The California volun
teers are under the jurisdiction of Gen
eral Shafter, representing the Federal
| authorities, the moment they set foot
on the soil of California, and not as
Seamans vaingloriously announced sub
ject to the orders of Governor Gage or
his disgusting puppet. Gage may real
ize the false position his asinine
mouthpiece has placed him in and re
pudiate his utterances as the easiest
way out of the dilemma, but he will
have no official voice in the celebration
in honor of the returning California
volunteers.
Commodore S^reckels said last night
that the Governo" and his party had
been given a place in the line of the
naval parade and that Gage must abide
by that arrangement if he desired to
participate in the pageant.
HOW THE AFFAIR OCCURRED
Stenographic Report of the Tilt
Between Seamans and the
Committee.
Adjutant General Seamans of the Gov
ernor's staff intimated to the citizens'
executive committee yesterday that Mr.
Gage, who has evinced a spirit of indif
ference and antipathy to the reception
to the California Volunteers, had sudden
ly concluded that he wanted to be the
whole show and that if he was not al
"I TALKED TOO MUCH."2
SAYS GEN. SEAMANS.
I HAVE not read the newspapers and consequently I know nothing of
tne arrangements made by the citizens' committee to receive our re
turning troops. I believe they ere going to hold a night demonstration
and a naval parade.
WE have made special arrangements to receive the Cai.fornia regi
ment on their arrival. When the Sherman reaches port she will be re
ceived by Governor GAGE and the next day WE will march the troops
through the city under a military escort to the Presidio. That will be
OUR. demonstration.
Whether or not Governor GAGE and his staff will participate with
the citizens in their night parade has not been settled to MY knowledge.
The GOVERNOR received an invitation to appear mounted in the parad'i.
but HE thought it was quite a hazardous undertaking on account of
bursting skyrockets. I conferred with General Shafter as to the military
etiquette of the GOVERNOR and staff participating mounted in a demon
stration of this kind and he informed ME that generally the high civic
authorities ride in carriages on occasions if this kind. So far as I know
the GOVERNOR has not as yet made up HIS mind whether HE will
participate in the night parade.
Governor GAGE will announce HIS ultimatum as to whether HE
will tow the yacht Aggie on the occasion of the naval parade at nine
o'clock to-morrow morning.
When I first mentioned the matter to the GOVERNOR HE in
formed me that HE would not take a tow. HE was willing to take HIS
position behind Commodore Spreckels. The citizens' committee cannot
dictate the will of the GOVERNOR in this matter. The bay is larg9
and WE will go out to meet the transport any way WE plcnse. The
GOVERNOR intends to take HIS proper place in this reception.
I talked this matter over with the GOVERNOR and HE informed
ME that HE objected to taking a tow for the reason that HE might
not see fit to go over the entire course with the parade, or HE might
wish to break in and go alongside the transport. â Adjutant General

conception of what is right.
lowed to be the main thing he would not
play at all.
The general appeared before the com
mittee on the Invitation of Oommitteeman
W. J. Martin, whom he had consulted
earlier in the day and who was so
astounded with the information he im
parted that he thought it wise to turn
him over to the committee. When the
conference was concluded the Governor's
emissary was thoroughly convinced that
there were others. The general started
out with the astonishing announcement
that Governor Gage was not satisfied
with the arrangements that had been
made for the celebration. Mr. Gage did
not propose to allow the State tug. Gov
ernor Markham. to take part in the naval
parade if it had to tow a yarht. Mr.
Gage did propose, that the military par
ade in the city should be arranged ac
cording to his Ideas.

mows over tneir respective opinions or
Mr. Gage, but their discussion only reach
ed the point of angry words and no blood
was spilled.
The general was greeted kindly by the
committee and proceeded to tell the mem
bers what was what without losing time
on preliminaries.
Following is a stenographic report of
the proceedings:
Mr. Martinâ At my request General
Seamans will state to you the programme
as far as their participation in the street
parade Is concerned.
General Seamansâ Mr. Mayor and gen
tlemen of the committee: I appear here
this morning at the suggestion of Mr.
Martin. Certain Inquiries I made from
Mr. Martin seem to him should be made
before this committee, and then I indi
cated the programme for the day parade
upon the landing of the volunteers from
Manila. Mr. Martin thought it would be
advisable for me to advise the committee
of the desires of the Governor in that re
gard; hence I am here for that purpose.
In the first place I noticed in the papers
yesterday that the Governor's tug. Gov
ernor Markham, had been assigned to po
sition In the naval parade. It was stated
she would have attached to her a tow
in the shape of a yacht. The Governor
received an invitation from Senator Per
kins to accept - his hospitality on the
steamer to be tendered to the members of
the Legislature, State officers, the con
gressional delegation and the executive
committee, but as he had already arrang
ed to go out with his friends on the Gov
ernor Markham. he declined to go. The
position indicated in the newspapers ys
the position assigned to the tug in the.
naval parade was perfectly satisfactory
to the Governor, but he did not like to
have a tow attached to that boat, and
he wanted the proper authority advised
as to his objections.
Mr. Lawrenceâ L>oes the Governor not
know thai we have not enough tugs for
the naval parade? Does he not know that
every tug has been assigned a tow?
General Seamansâ l don't know what the
Governor knows.
Mr. Lawrenceâ This was all published
in the newspapers, and if the Governor
would read the newspapers he might get
an intelligent Idea of current events.
General amans â am here to represent
the Governor, and I f eel perfectly compe
tent to protect myself and the Governor
from any aspersions of this character. if
1 can be heard with due xespect I am
ready to proceed, but if not I ask permis
sion to withdraw.
Mr. Lawrenceâ Does the Governor not
read the newspapers to keep himself in
formed? All this matter has been pub
lished in the newspapers for weeks.
General Seaman*â l don't know whether
the Governor reads the newspapers or not.
Mr. Lawrence â If the Governor would
read the newspapers he might learn some
thing about what the committee is doing.
General Seamansâ l come here to outline
the form of the parade, and I do not pro
pose to be insulted.
Mr. Lawrenceâ Do you intend to convey,
sir, that anything that I have said has
Insulted you?
General Seaman?â l do not want to have
any aspersions cast on the Governor. We
feel that we have tne right to say how
the parade shall be conducted.
Mr Lawrenceâ l will not permit you. sir,
to say here that I have cast any asper
sions on the Governor: and as for you
personally, if I intended to cast any as
persions on you you would know it. If I
jumped on you or on the Governor you
would know very soon that something had
happened. I speak very plainly when I
desire to make myself understood.
General Seamansâ l will let you know,
sir, that I am able here, sir, and every
where, sir, to protect myself; and I shall
not permit you, sir, nor any other man,
to Insult me. If I â  cannot be heard
â with due respect to his Excellency I shall
ask permission to withdraw.
Mr. Lawrenceâ You are at perfect lib
erty to withdraw whenever you like, but
I do not propose that you shall come here
representing the Governor or any one else,
in bulldoze this committee or the citizens
of this community as to how this recep
tion shall be conducted. The citizens have
put up all the money, appointed their
committees and have been proceeding: tor
a month past to make their arrangements,
and have been proceeding to carry them
out: and they will not submit to be Inter
fered with at this late date. That, you
must understand, sir, before you go any
farther.
Mayor Phelanâ Now. gentlemen, gentle
men, let us get along quietly. Nobody Is
seeking- trouble on this committee. Now,
general, general: now, Mr. Lawrence-
Order was restored and the meeting pro
ceeded.
Mr. Martinâ have heard the address
of the distinguished gentleman represent
ing the Governor. I would now ask the
committee to hear what I have to say.
The gentleman has the right. In fact I
invite interruption if I misstate facts.
I met the gentleman to-day in company
with others, and the programme now in
ills poÂ«Â«*snfr.i was made known to me.
I at once took exception to it on the
ground that it would interfere with the
plans. of this committee; that while I had
no doubt that this committee would
yield as far as possible to the Governor
or his representatives if their wants were
made known, I felt that this committee
would tolerate no interference at the
eleventh hour, especially when it was pro
posed to set aside the programme ar
ranged by conference between the com-
It tee representing the parents, the
Native Sons and Daughters and this com
mittee.' The gentleman called my atten
tion to the fact that first came the United
States authorities, second those of the
State of California and thirdly the muni
cipality of San Francisco; that he as the
Governor's representative controlled the
State troops and had prepared orders for
their assembling In San Frail Cisco. I
called his attention to the fact that this
committee had provided the money to

bring thorn to San Francisco in order t that !
they might participate in the parade; |
i that it was very evident to me that there j
was a wide difference between the Gov- |
ernor's wishes in the matter and the ar
rangements of this committee. So far as :
the Governor's wishes with reference to
the naval parade are concerned I made it â 
moll clear that this committee had no
jurisdiction over the matter; that that i
was something to bo controlled by the |
commodore commanding the naval pa- '
rade. While I was not authorized to
speak for the commodore I felt that he â 
would â ' insist upon his regulations being
carried out. The gentleman stated that it i
| was '.he Governors Intention to meet the
i transport first and welcome the troops, ;
I and he did not care to be ineumbered by
a tow. In the interest of harmony I re
quested that the gentleman appear before
: this committee and submit his pro
; gramme. I further stated that this com
i mittee would insist upon their rights in
the matter, and while they would con- i
cede any reasonable point, they were not i
i willing to.be dictated to by the Governor â 
: or his representative at a time when our !
i arrangements had been all made. It i
I seemed to me that the Governor should
have made known his wishes at an
earlier date. â¢
Mr. Beamansâ next proposition was
as to the poaitton of the Governor and ;
National Guard .in the military parade
on the day of the landing of the return-
Ing volunteers from the Philippine Isl- '
ands. That Is determined between the
United States military authorities here
and the Governor of the State. Mr. Mar- I
tin stated to me that the commute*
would like to know what had been deter
mined. First, a* I understand . it. the
United States military authorities will
furnish an escort from the regular army,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 1899.
THREE DAYS MORE, AND THE
SHERMAN WILL ENTER PORT
AT noon' to-day (San Francisco time) the transport Sherman should be only about %0 nautical miles from home,
and each succeeding twenty-four hours should see Her lessen the distance by at least 290 knots. That would
bring her to the Farallones at about noon on the 24th. Should the Sherman have made better time than ex
pected coming across she could not In any event make th? Farallones by Wednesday before dark, so in the
event of her getting well along by the afternoon of the 23d Captain Grant Will blow lown so as to make the
Faraliones at noon oil the 24th.
(Vccording to Nautical Expert McMillan'B calculations the Sherman was at noon yesterday (^an Francisco
time) in latitude 40* degrees 35 minutes north, longitude 150 degrees 25 minutes west, or about 1250 nautical miles
from San Francisco. -,_ ~ Â..,_ a

special escort of the Governor of the
State and then the Governor of Califor
nia and his staff. After this will rollow
the National Guard of California. Next
will come the returning volunteers. Me
yond that and after that we have noth
ing to suggest, nothing to propose ana
nothing to say. We leave the rest to
the gentlemen who have charge of the
parade to arrange as they see nt. ir
there be any other programme that this
committee would like to have carried out
wo will confer with them if they see lit.
Mayor Phelanâ la the Governor to par
ticipate in the night parade?
Grand Marshal Plstolesiâ Shat
ter said that he would supply proper
mounts for Governor Gngo and his stair.
General Seamansâ l presume he will,
but I am not advised about it.
Mayor Phelanâ And as to the tug?
General Seamansâ He proposes to go
out on the State tug Governor Markham,
and he request.* that there be no tow.
Mayor Phelanâ Of whom does he make
this request?
â¢â¢He makes that request of who
ever has that arrangement. We called
oh Mr. Sprockets this morning, but failed
to, find him in. His representatives. Mr. |
Leake and Mr Martin, were there." !
Mr. Martinâ 1 would like to correct the
general on that lust statement. 1 think
he will recollect that we .stated most em
phatically that we were not there to
represent Mr. Spreckels. We met the
general, and In discussing this matter I
stated that I deemed it proper that the
Governor should make his wants known
to this committee, so far as the day pa
rade was concerned. I differed from the
Governor, as the city is raising these
funds. We are paying the transportation
of these troops, and should be consulted.
I took the ground that the municipality
had some rights in this matter, and I
don't propose that the Governor or any
one else shall come in here and interfere >
with us. .- .-
Seamans â Mr. Martin has asked me as !
the military representative of the Gov
ernor to come here. I would ask Mr.
Martin what he proposes. We may not
be so very far apart in this matter.
â¢ Martinâ l am very glad to see that the
Governor's representative will be glad to
co-operate with this committee, ana 1 f+;el
I can speak for the balance of the
committee on that point; but It must be
made very clear that any action on the
part of the Governor or his representa
tives, independently of the committee, will
mar the demonstration.
Lawrence â 1 don't understand why the :
Governor at this late day seeks to Inter
fere with our arrangements. That the
Governor should plead Ignorance concern-
Ing this Is a mystery. too deep for under
standing. If he claims that he does not
know what we are going to do, when all
the papers have been devoting a great
deal of space to the proposed celebration,
it argues that he does not keep informed on
current events. We have gone ahead and
tried the best we could to make this a
grand occasionâ the grandest in the his
tory of this city. 1 do not see where
the Governor could do anything for. this
meeting except lend his presence; and ho
has been invited by the grand marshal.
The volunteers are beyond his control.
He is no more their commanding officer
than I am. Major General Shafter said
he would consult with this committee;
that the volunteers were in his hands, and
that he would consult with this commit
tee as to assigning them to a place in
the parade. Do you not know, sir, that as
far as the military companies in the inte
rior are concerned they could not move a
step to participate In these ceremonies
ecept for the courtesy of the citizens of
this community? The State has not pro
vided one dollar, but this committee pays
for the transportation of every man. We
want them with us. and they have signi
'lied their willingness to participate with
the people of this city; and we do not de
sire that you or any one else shall mar
the success of this grand demonstration
at this late moment by Interfering with all
the plans. What part the Governor has in
this I don't see, and I am amazed by an
attempt at this late day to interfere.
These organizations belong to us; these j
boys were born in this city, and they are
ours. The people of this city have raised
a fund of $50,000. a portion of which only |
is for the pageant. The balance will be
expended In taking care of the sick, the
maimed and the penniless. An attempt to
come in at this moment to disturb the ]
arrangements of the committee simply
surprises me, and, I think, all the rest of
the committee. The grand marshal is
present and will tell you what arrange- !
ments have been made.
Seaman?- 1 am very sure that the Gov
ernor of this State has no desire to mar in
any way. but to facilitate so far as lies in
his power the arrangements made for the
reception of the returning volunteers, hut
so far as providing money and bringing
the National Guard Into the city of San
Francisco Is concerned, I do not know
myself whether the Governor of the State
is advised that they are to be brought
here at the expense of the committee or
not. I certainly have not been officially
Informed of it. It ife certainly very com
mendable on the part of the citizens of \
this city to bring them here in order to \
make the reception more appropriate on
that occasion. I know It to be a fact
that the outside organizations of the Na
tional Guard have no funds .with which i
they can be brought to this city, and if !
money is supplied I am not aware that '.
the Governor is advised of the appropria
tion by the city of funds for the traps- ;
portation of the troops to the city, but
I think that he would fully appreciae it.
He expressed himself, not only to me, last !
night but to other members of his staff,
as wishing to co-operate in every legiti- j
mate and proper "way that he could to
make this demonstration fitting and up
to the occasion. The reason why 1 de
layed to inform this committee, or rep
resentatives of it, what his Idea.was is the
simple fact that it was not fully con
cluded or determined upon until last night
at midnight, and we could -not tell you '
until now what we thought to be fit and
proper, and I am here at the earliest mo
ment, and we ask with a view of ascer- '
taining what your ideas are about what
we thought In regard to certain portions j
of this parade. â 
Martinâ would like to ask the gentle
man who preceded me if It was not a fact
that he had in his possession an arrange- ;
ment for this parade, and If he was not j
willing to turn It- over to me, and I want >
to know if this is subject to a change by !
arrangement with this â¢committee.
General Seamansâ l pulled my pro- \
gramme out of my pocket and I stated to
him as I stated to you. that Is all the
programme there is. It Is exactly identi
cal with what I said to this committee
to-day. The Governor will have no other j
programme. . .".-;â ...-.
Martinâ l will ask the gentleman If he I
is willing to submit their programme to
this committee and coincide with the com- i
mittee in any changes we may suggest. â ;.
General Seamansâ l win give the ; pro
gramme to the committee, but I will not
commit the Governor In advance to any
thing this committee may see fit to do. Â I

Guard troops, and 1 want to deny the
statement that (i.-neralSeamansmade that
General Dickinson is subordinate to Him .
and if ho can show me how a major gen

general, which General Beamana Is, I
should like t<i know. He Is simply a staff

ihe Held mid take charge of the^troops
in the nbsence of the Governor, ami If he
had known hIR business he would have
gjoni to General Dickinson.
Martinâ J would state that if General
Die!- 1 :son would load and be first in the
line of battle In the absence of the Gov
ernor, 1 have no doubt but that the Gov
ernof would he absent.
"Is Mr. Gage going tn participate In the
night parade?" inquired Chairman Phelan
of Grand Marshal Plstolosi.
His spokesman, the adjutant general,
previous to his departure volunteered to
answer the question. The Governor would
probatily be in the parade, and would have
been pleased to go mounted, but he was
unattle jo secure a ffery steed to his liking,
and Bo he would ride In a carriage and
expected the parade committee to provide
him with one.
"The question of a mount has been set
tled. " said Mr. I'istolesi. "General Shafter
is going to supply us with all we need.""
This exploded one of the Gape excuses,
and his military representative rushed to
the rescue. â¢
"Besides we nre unofficially Informed
that there will be fireworks during the
night parade, and the Governor Is afraid
thnt if he- rides horseback his anlmnl
might become soured and he would get
hurl." and General Scamans never blushed
for the timidity of the commander-ln
chief of the State militia.

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES PROPOSED
BERKELEY, Aug. 20.-Can the Unl- I
versity of California be represented n .he
monster p:.rade which is to welcome the.
California boys home from Manila? This
is the question which is now being dis
cussed by the Berkeley collegians. There
is a general opinion that the university
ought to take part in the reception, but
the way In which it could be carried out
is troubling the college men.
The executive committee of the Asso
ciated Students recommended to the
faculty that the university regiment of
, cadets be called out to march in the pro
' session. The cadet battalion, -lowever
will not be organized until the occasion
| for the display^ has passed, and at the
suggestion of Profesor Frank Soule, the
idea of a military showing has been given
up.
There is another way left, however, and
: it Is that all the students appear decked
| in the strangely battered top hats which
I custom dictates that the upper, class of
I the university should affect. The liars
together with college yells would make up
something distinctive of the State Uni
versity. Many of the students are eager
to carry out the plan.
HOMECOMING OF THE FIRST.
Rev. E. Nelander.of the First English
Lutheran Church preached an able ser
mon yesterday, to his : congregation : on
"The Homecoming of the* First California
Regiment." In part he said:
' /They are coming home! Eventful months
have passed since our boys went forth at their
country's call. What a day that was! â â â â  The
huzza could not drown the sadness. Fathers,
mothers, sisters crying: the boys smiling- out
side, crying inside. With bright uniforms and
new rifles that glistened In -the sunlight, with
a silken flag-that floated proudly in the "f rep
air above them, : they marched down Market
street amid the roll of drums and tear-fllled
eyes and aching hearts. They were gone, but
our hearts went with them. In the cheerless
camp, on the weary marches, .in the hour of
battle we were with j them. Nor had they for
gotten those who were left behind, as testify
their weary hours of homesickness, the starlit
nights of picket duty, the sly tears which they
wiped off when they heard a group at the
campfire singing about the old folks at home
But now they are returning home. -Not all
but the spirit forms of the fallen will fill un
the gaps and keep step with the living. And
if their uniforms are not so bright; If their
musket* are runty with the damp* of Philip
pine swamp*; If the Soar old flag is rent and
torn, It will only increase our grateful homaÃ-o,

I The captain Informed them that he would
! do anything he could in the matter, as
| he was only too glad of an opportunity to
j enow his appreciation of the treatment
he had received from the people of San

PARIS, Aug. 21 â 2 a, Besides St.

wrecked. At a late hour 20,000 people j
were in the Boulevard de Magenta,
which runs past the end of the Rue de

moving by the Republican Guards, who
have made a remarkable display of force.
Large bodies of police were constantly
operating in an*] around the Rue de

iness at the nearest barracks.

Fifty or sixty policemen were seen :

to draw their swords against the anar

Four policemen were wounded, two se- ,

A lamentable feature of the affair is ,
that it will be regarded as a pro-Drefus !
demonstration and react greatly to the
detriment of the chance of acquittal.
It is much to be feared that yester
day's scenes were due to the weakness
the Government has displayed over the
<;i;erin affair* The Government's desire
to avoid bloodshed has been misinter- i
preted with the worst results.
It appears that the anarchists' de- |
monstration was decided upon at a ;
meeting held Saturday night. The
Journal dv Peuple, edited by Sebastian
Faure, published a manifesto de
nouncing the military party, the anti-
Somites, the monarchists and the
priests and urged Its supporters to j
meet force with force.
"Should Dreyfus be convicted," said
the manifesto, "it will be a triumph of
bandits. Should he be acquitted the
military section will be open to rebel
lion."
The paper called on all anarchists to
demonstrate against the priests and the |
Jesuits. Copies of the manifesto were
scattered broadcast and the result was
that the anarchists flocked into the
afreets singing "Carmagnole" and cry
ing "Abas Rochefort," "Abas Drumont"
and "Abas â¢ ruerin."
The Guerin affair is becoming a com- '

COURT OF CASSATION
WILL SAVE DREYFUS
New Trials to Be Ordered Until the
Court-Martial Acquits tiie
Prisoner.
SEATTLE. Aug. 20.â M. Leon Bureau of
Paris, formerly private secretary of M.
Labor!, is in the city a guest of Dr.
Adriene Monod, the French Vice Consul.
He said to-day the present trinl of Drey
fus would result In his acquittal. If "a
verdict of guilty were returned the Court
of Cassation, the. highest French author
ity, would at once set It aside and order
another court-martial, and so on until
Dreyfus be acquitted. This court knew
that French law was being juggled by the
military court, and had two grounds on
which it could set aside such a sentence:
First, violation of the law, and, second,
abuse of power.
"When the Court of Cassation sent
Dreyfus back for a second trial he was
remanded on the charge of having been
the author of the bordereau." said M. Bu
reau. "Now this Is the only thing he could
be tried for. Instead of sticking to this
the court has permitted witnesses to talk
of his relations with women and other
outside matters, which is directly a vio
lation of French law."
M. Bureau said it was within the power
of the Court of Cassation to have decreed
Dreyfus innocent. In fact, there were but
two things for that tribunal to doâ either
adjudge him not guilty or send him back
for retrial. This latter proceeding was
deemed best, as through a retrial a me
dium would be furnished and so give the
military party a ehancr to redeem itself.
It would look so much better in the eyes
of the world and help to take away the
odium any acquittal by the Court of Cas
sation would make.

CLEMENCEAU,S REVIEW
OF THE DREYFUS CASE
Says the Trial Will Last Much Long
er Than Was at First
Expected.
NEW YORK. Aug. 30.â The Journal has
the following from Paris: George Clemen
ceau, in a review of the Dreyfus trial,
Bays: The trial at Rennes will surely last
, much longer than was expected at first.
At this present, moment there are enough
witnesses to occupy the court down to
Sptembef 2, but Dew witnesses are gath
ered from day to day. Some capital ques
tions, such as the Mercier-Schnelder for
gery, and another very strong case which
baa not been spoken of yet and in which
Generals Morn, r and Â«'hanoine are
Strongly implicated, will surely occupy
Beveral sittings of the court. If matters
are to be made dear, therefore, there
i.Â« no use to anticipate the end of the de
bates before the 10th or 15th of September,
and I should not wonder if things came
, still later to a dose.
Some very important witnesses have.
j thus far been beard, but it is a matter of
< remark that they are much more impor
tajit by personal character arid title than
by the weight of their evidence. In no
' English or American or even French court
were such witnesses ever seen.
A matter of wonder is that the French
Supreme Court has increased with great
care the domain in which the Rennes
court-martial is called to move. Judges,
witnesses and the State's Attorney thus
far have not taken into acount this deci
sion of the Supreme Court. It has been
settled, for Instance, that the bordereau
1 was Anally recognized as being in the
handwriting of Esterhazy, and, legally,
the only question before the court-martial
is this: "Has Dreyfus delivered to the
; German Government thp very documents
] which Esterhazy mentioned in his bor
dereau?"
There is not thn slightest doubt left
j that Dreyfug had never any connection
whatever, direct or indirect, with Estor
: hazy. At no time was this point con
i tested. Nobody ever argued that the two
; men ever had any. So that If the law
whs followed th<> whole trial at Reenes

DREYFUS COURT-MARTIAL
RESUMES ITS SITTING
Colonel Fabre Reiterates His Convic
tion That the Accused Wrote
the Bordereau.
RENNKS, Auk. 21.â The Dreyfus court
martial rpconvened this morning at the
usual hour. Maitre Labor! was not prps
ent. His doctors considered that it was
inadvisable for him to attempt to take
ANTI-SEMITIC LEAGUE'S LEADERS AND HEADQUARTERS.
MERCIER SAYS DREYFUS'
CONVICTION IS CERTAIN
RENNES, Aug. 20.â General Mercier, who was Minister of War when
Captain Dreyfus was condemned, and who in the present trial is
the virtual prosecutor, was this afternoon Invited to make a state
ment of the position of the anti-Dreyfusards. General Mercier
gave through his eldest son the following expression of his views:
General Mercier considers it useless to attempt to convert foreign opinion
regarding the Dreyfus question, in which, moreover, foreigners have no right
to Intervene. Foreign people have been misled by their press, which Is vio
lently Dreyfusard, for the good reason that a majority of the foreign news
papers have been bribed by thp Jewish syndicate. General Mercier considers
that anything he might say explaining his position, which is that of a major
ity of the French people, would be useless. The best reply to Dreyfusard
statements abroad will be the condemnation of Dreyfus.
This condemnation is only a matter of ten days or a fortnight, for con
demned Dreyfus certainly will be. Foreigners will then sec that their jour
nals ha^e deceived them, for they will recognize that the mass of the French
nation, who will receive the news of the conviction of Dreyfus as joyful tid
ings, is not composed of officials, and that the majority of the French applaud
the condemnation; it will be because it is just and merited.
The correspondent then called upon Maitre Labori. who lives within
200 yards of General Mercier, the houses of both being guarded by gen
darmes and dt'cteetives who sit in chairs in the roadway in front of the
houses. M. Labor! was taking the air in the garden. He has been suffer
ing severely fn>m insomnia and to-day was feverish and excited. The
wound itself has not made the progress the doctors hoped for, although
there has been no relapse.
In view of his general condition, his medical advisers oppose his go
ing to court to-morrow, as he had desired. They predict that the exer
tion would so overtax his strength as to compel him to take to his bed,
which he would not probably leave in that event for a month. Tues
day or Wednesday, therefore, will more probably see his reappearance In
court. He will be provided with a specially constructed chair that will
enable him to conduct the cross-examination at the outset, without rising
from his seat.
M. Labor! is intensely anxious to return to court, even if he has to be
carried there in an ambulance. He is dissatisfied with M. Demange's
conduct of the case thus far, and on his return he intends -to have Gen
eral Mercier and the other generals placed upon the witness-stand. After
reading their evidence he is confident of his ability to crush Mercier and
he expects to use the Schneider and Fanizzardi telegrams also to con
found Mercier.
part in to-day's proceedings in view of the
danger of a relapse.
The witness was. Colonel Fabre, who
deposed that he had discovered a simi
larity between the handwriting of the ac
cused and that of the bordereau. He re
it, rated his conviction of the guilt or
Dreyfus, saying:
"1 am sure he wrote the bordereau.
Plotters to Be Arrested.
NEW YORK. Aug. 20.â A Sun cable
from ' Paris says: There are rumors that
further arrests of plotters against the
Government will be made, but they pan
not be confirmed. It was said the arrest
<>f M. Mlllevoye a Nationalist leader, was
imminent, and he went to Prefect of Po
lice Lepine to ask if the report were true.
The latter said tho Government had no
intention of arresting him. I-e Petrie de
clares English newspapers paid Esterhazy
25.000 francs to declare himself the author
of the bordereau.
MAJOR HARRISON ILL
WITH YELLOW FEVER
The First Case That Has Occurred in
the New Camp at Cris
tobal.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 20.â Major
Russell Harrison, inspector general, is
critically ill with yellow fever. The dis
ease has progressed for three days, al
though it was not pronounced yellow fever
until this afternoon. The case is the first
to occur at Cristobal, to which place the
headquarters was removed last month to
â¢ scape infection.
Of late the quarantine rules have been
relaxed, owing to the fact that there have
t.et'ii no rases in the city, and tho officers
from headquarters have been in the habit
of coming to Santiago daily and returning
to headquarters at night. Major Harrison
has been isolated, but not brought to the
fever hospital.
The Army and Navy Journal, In Its is
sue of August 12, reports the death, from
yellow fever, of Private Beattie of the
Eighth Infantry, the report bearing the
signature of Major O'Reilly. This is an
error, due to translating ''dead," the word
in the code message, which should have
been rendered "sick."
Beattie had a very light case, and It is
even doubtful whether the disorder was
yellow fever. He has been on duty now
several days since his convalescence.

NEARLY WRECKED
BY A HURRICANE
Terrifying Experiences of Passengers
on the Kansas City, Off Cape
Hatteras.
SAVANNAH. Ga., Aug. 20. â The
steamer Kansas City, which reached here
this morning fifty hours overdue, had a
thrilling experience in the West Indian
j hurricane. The steamer encountered the
storm off Cape Hatteras, and battled with
it lor two days. The ship was driven
i 100 miles off her course seaward. The sa
j loon was flooded with water, the passen
gers were wet, bedraggled and sick, and
| some of the women became hysterical.
Must of the. passengers remained in their
| rooms, and those on the upper deck were
| unable to get out. The ship rolled and
! lurched as the huge waves struck her
I and broke over her decks. The doors and
windows were battered, and every mo
ment during the fiercest of the storm It
was feared that the skylights would be
broken in and let the waves through. At i
one time danger of tiro was added to the '
horror of the storm. Friday morning the I
electric light wires Bet fire to the casing
in the after companionway. Thf> fire
worked its way along the casing to the
main saloon. The ;Uarm was given im
mediately, and the call to quarters was
sounded. The storm was still at its
height, but the crew responded quickly to i
the call, and the fire was subdued. All i
the casualties were among the officers !
and crew. Captain Fisher was injured j
though not seriously, by a fall, and First !
Officer Smith was thrown against the
deck and internally Injured. Several coal â 
passers wore injured, and it was only by
extra effort that they were kept at
work.
NEW RAILROAD TO BE

Initial Meeting of the Stockholders of
the Stockton-Sacramento
Road.
STOCKTON, Aug. 20.â The Initial meet-
Ing of the promoters of the new railroad
between Stockton and Sacramento was i
held here this afternoon. Those present
voted to keep ali the plans secret for the
present, several declaring there had been
too much discussion already. The result
of the meeting was the election of H. T.
Compton as chief engineer, and authori
zation was given him to start the survey
as soon as he can make necessary prepa
rations. It was further decided to incor
porate and establish headquarters in this
city.
The present Identity of those interested
will nut be made public, but the personnel !
of those present at to-day's meeting in-!
(iicales that several farmers and shippprs I
are the prime movers. A positive denial
is made that the Santa Fe is in any way
interested, and those enlisted in the en
[ terprise are confident that an independent
I line through the upper valley will be com
pleted within twelve months. It is learned â 
on the outside that the company has the
option on a valuable piece of water front
property located on the north side of the
Htockton channel. There is already a
bulkhead on it and several miles of grade
running north, which was completed sev
eral years ago for a road which was to
have been known as the Lodi Terminal
Railroad.

ADMIRAL DEWEY DECLARES
FOR PHILIPPINE AUTONOMY
LONDON, Aug. 20.â The Rome correspondent of the
Daily News writes that Lewis M. Iddings, secretary of
the American embassy at Rome, enabled him to interview
Admiral Dewey at Naples at the moment of the Olympia's
departure from that place. According to the correspondent,
the admiral said:
"I have the question of the Philippines more at heart
than any other American, because I know the Filipinos inti
mately. They know I am their friend. The recent insurrec
tion is the fruit of the anarchy that long reigned in the isl
ands. The insurgents will have to submit themselves to law
after being accustomed tc no law. I believe and affirm,
nevertheless, that the Philippine question very shortly will
be solved. The Filipinos are capable of governing them
selves. It is a question of time, but the only way to settle
the insurrection and to assure prosperity is to concede self
government. I have never been in favor of violence against
the Filipinos. The islands are now blockaded by the fleet,
and war reigns in the interior. I would like to see auton
omy first conceded and then annexation talked about."
The correspondent says Dewey told him he had in his
case made the first exception to his rule of not giving inter
views to newspapers.

IGNORANCE CAUSED
THE INSURRECTION
President Schurman of the Philippine
Peace Commission Talks of
the War.
CHICAGO, Aug. 20,-^Jacob Gould Schur
man, United States Commissioner to the
Philippines, arrived in Chicago to-day
irom the islands, of which he has just
completed a six months' study at the in
stance of President McKinley. He left
for his home in Ithaca, N. V., and will
report to the President as soon as a meet
ing can be arranged. In an interview he
said :
So far as the results of my official
negotiations with the representatives
of Aguinaldo or other Filipino officials
were concerned, I am not at liberty to
talk of them till I have made my re
port to the President concerning the
islands in general. However, there is
much to be told. In my opinion the
rebellion, the last of which we are try
ing to suppress, was due in the first
place to several causes, the principal
of which were the tyranny of some of
the religious orders, the exercise of ar
bitrary power by the Governor Gener
als and the delay and corruption of
justice.
The leaders of the rebellion tell their
followers the most astounding tales of
the Americans, and the common peo
ple believe that the priests under
American rule would subject them to
the same tyranny. That the American
army killed priests or otherwise mal
treated churchmen or church property
is itself utterly without foundation.
Aguinaldo is believed in the islands
to be honest, and I think he is acting
honestly in money matters, but wheth
er from moral or political reasons I
would not say. While I don't care to
discuss the real motives behind the re
bellion at this time, I will say that
If it were suppressed there would be
many prominent native officials out of
an occupation.
Mr. Schurman declined to answer the
question as to whether he had been the
subject of any anti-imperialist commu
nications, saying that on that question he
would not speak. He said that the re-
sources of the Islands were great, but
that he must decline to commit himself on
the subject of making them a part of this
country.
ARRESTED BECAUSE HE
CRITICIZED HIS COLONEL
Surgeon-Major Warne of the First
South Dakota Volunteers in
Duress.
MINNEAPOLIS. Aug. 20,â A special to
the Times from Sioux Falls, S. D.. says:
Senator Pettigrew is in receipt of a ca
blegram dated at Nagasaki, Japan, from
Dr. R. C. Warne, major and surgeon of
the First Regiment, South Dakota Volun
teers, which pays:
â¢'Arrested by Frost for published let
ter."
This Is the culmination of the charges
made by Warne against Colonel Alfred
S. Frost of the South Dakota regiment In
a letter published here last month, in
which Warne referred to Frost as a "low,
contemptible cur. looking only to his own
interests; that he would gladly sacrifice
every man in the regiment for a few dol
lars in his own pocket or a littlt glory for
himself, and that he has no interest in th>;
men except to use them for his own sel
fish advancement."
FOUR ARMIES MAY BE

Plan Likely to Be Put Into Execution
When Otis Receives His Re
inforcements.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.-The map of
the Philippines, and especially of that
portion of the island of Luzon north and
south of Manila, which have been pre
pared for the use of Secretary Root, may
assume a more important part in the com
ing campaign than has been given it nero
tofore. Secretary Root has not only as
certained where the United States troops
are located and has them nicely marked
, off on the map but he has also taken into
i consideration such information as can be
! obtained relative to the population of the
i adjacent country, the kind of people and
| their disposition toward the United Stit?a.
I The Secretary has been studying the lines
| of transportation and learning what he
j can of the geography of the country.
It Is believed that more than one army
I may operate to advantage in the Philip
i pines, and the suggestion has been made
by some army officers that an army
i should start from different points and
! operate in such a manner as to distract
and destroy the Filipino forces.
At present the United States forces do
i not occupy the line of railway half-wav
|to Lingayen. on the gulf of the samV>
; name. It has been suggested that if one
i force were to start from Lingayen and
j move south at the same time that another
I was moving north there would be a very
i great probability of soon securing the
entire railway for the use of the array
and the Insurgents would be separated
into divisions east and west by the rail
road as they are now divided into north
ern and southern bands. Between Angeles
| and Lingayen is Tarlac. a town of con
| siderable size and situated in a province
where the natives are said to be not un
! friendly to the United States. If this
province could be occupied it might be of
great advantage to the Government
m?- L e i e c u re m . ere 'y suggestions it
may be that when the army in the Phil
ippines consists of 60.000 men instead of
about 20,000 or 25.000 it will be possible to
have four or more armies operating in-
I stead of two as during the last campaign.
The location of troops as marked by
i pins on the map prepared for Secretary
I Root show the places occupied as follows:
North of Manilaâ Under General Mac-
Arthur, a point above Angeles (General

A GREAT DEMAND FOR GOODS
WHILE the commercial agencies report trade
its high pressure pitch of the pan
few months eekly bank clearings indi
cate a relaxation, the gain last week falling to about
19 per cent over the same week last year. This is the
smallest increase for a long time. Still, when the
farmers of Kansas and Nebraska buy 7000 buggies
vagons in three months business must be good.
and when the feature of trade in the latter State ; -;
the active purchasing oi pianos by the same farm
ers, times certainly cannot be called hard. For the
rest, all reports from the Hast and West unite in
saying that the demand for goods of all descriptions
was never better. That for iron and steel is so enor
ers for manufactured products have to
b< delayed owing to difficulty in petting the steel.
The Cramps have laid off many hundred hands and
asked Ku~ n extension of time on the two
warships for this reason. In the iron trade this is a
us case of too much activity for the good of
the trade. Wheat, as indicated in this column last
. has advanced, as the quotations have been
; too low (â  g the conditions of the
- crops, and the export demand has corre
spondingly increased. The wool trade shows no
pause worthy of note, the sales for three weeks be
ing 28,300,000 pounds, against 13,096,500 pounds for
:ne time last year, while a number of lineÂ« of .
the manufactured product have again advanced. The
nee in boots and -hoes has not checked the de
. and a further rise in lumber is reported at
several Western markets. In fact, prices for the vari
ous merchandise staples arc advancing with such con
tinuity that business men are beginning to ask how
long the advance can keep up without diminishing
the consumption. This, they say. must come, sooner
or later, but it is not in sight yet. Cotton is the only
staple to show any weakness, and this in the face of
more unfavorable crop reports.
The situation is unique. There is no boom in any
thing as far as can be seen, yet from all quarters of
the country come the same reports of unprecedented
trade activity, week after week. It seems to be a legit- â¢
rmate inquiry for merchandise for actual consump
tion, for speculation occupies a minor place in this
remarkable activity. Neither is it the usual reaction
after a long period of dullness, for the reaction oc
curred last year. It appears to be a .videspread and
continuous demand for goods, based upon an ex
ceptional condition of general prosperity.
A gratifying feature in this connection is the ea<;
ing off of the London money market, which, several
weeks ago. exhibited indications of a serious strin
gency, not to say panic. The passing of this cloud
is another sign of the healthy expansion in trade, and
cannot fail to increase confidence in the future.
Locally, there is nothing new. The great staples
of the coast still maintain their strong position, and
there is no decline of any consequence in anything.
The export trade is still so active that it is a question
of vessels, not "rdrr-. The domestic trade never was
better at this time of the year. , Money is in liberal
supply and easily procurable by sound borrowers,
collections are up to the average, and there have been
no large failures for -<>me time. Complaints are still
heard of the scarcity of farming hands, but this is
not a bad sign, as it indicates a lively condition of
trade. We lack nothing except a moderate increase
in the price of wheat and it- attendant cereals, and
if we get it we will break all records this year, if,
indeed, we are not doing it even now.
Congressman Gark of Missouri declares that the
people will break the necks of all Democrats who
play false. His warning i^ wretchedly indefinite, but
perhaps he means that Democrats, having a better
knowledge of the situation, intend to break the necks
of one another.
Tf the Spanish war did nothing else it jarred Eu
rope into a painful awakening that we are on the map.
Even Holland insists upon being ridiculous and
wants to lean on Germany as a protector against the
aggression of Uncle Sam in the West Indies.
So it appears after all that the Britishers care less
for their fellows in t,he Transvaal than they do for a
political advantage at home. A war is to be forced
upon the Boers in order that the Conservative party
may strengthen itself in London.
SEAMANS BRAYS FOR THE GOVERNOR
WHEN Governor. Gage appointed W. H. Sea
mans, the oniament.il ass of the orange belt,
to the responsible position of adjutant-gen
eral, The Call expected that some fantastic military
tricks would be played before high heaven. The ex
pected happened yesterday, and the angels wept.
General Seamans made such a show of ignorance
and asininity as was never before seen. The spec
tacle from start to finish, while ridiculous, was yet de
plorable. Appearing before the executive committee
appointed to arrange for a fitting reception of Cali
fornia volunteers, he sought by a great flourish of
assumed military authority to upset the plans adopted
by the citizens of San Francisco and transform the
celebration into an ovation in honor of himself and
the Governor.
The fact should be noted in connection with the
proposed welcome to the troop? that the money to
defray the cost of the celebration has been contrib
uted by the people of this city. The State is not
asked to pay a dollar. It is proposed that the citi
zens shall even pay the cost of transporting the com
panies of militia from the interior to the city. Now,
at the eleventh hour, when all the plans are com
plete. Gage's chief of staff makes his appearance, as
suming authority to remove Major General Shaftei
from the command of the United States troops and
Major General Dickinson from the command of the
State troops. The sublime ass has got the notion
between his ears that the First California Regiment
will be a State organization as soon as theÂ»troops
step from the transport to the land. The First Cali
fornia Regiment was duly mustered into the service
(-â { the L'nited States at the beginning of the war. and
will remain a United States volunteer regiment until
mustered out When Colonel Duboce of the First
California arrives here he will report to Major Gen
eral Shatter, commanding the Department of Cali
fornia. U. S. A. Colonel Duboee. an intelligent sol
dier, will readily obey the orders of the department
commander.
Senmans expanded himself yesterday before the
committee and "pooh-poohed" Major General Dick
inson, yet in the absence of the Governor the major
general is entitled to command by reason of being
next in rank to the commander-in-chief. Seamans
is a brigadier and Dickinson a major general.
General Seamans during pauses in his military
cavorting told the committee that he was authorized
to speak for the Governor. This was the rir-^t official
information of Gage's decision to pay any attention
whatever to the reception of the volunteers. During
the past month volunteers from other States have
been coming home. The people of San Francisco
assembling on the line (if march from the dock to
the Presidio have cheered the gallant soldiers. Dis
tinguished Governors and eminent citizens have jour
neyed half across the continent to welcome the in
coming troops. All this time Gage elected to stnv
away from San Francisco. He was not here to wel
come the visiting Governors. Californians regretted
that the State's reputation for hospitality had been
tarnished by the indifference of the Governor and
sought to find some excuse for his conduct. He pre
ferred the solace of secret intrigue at Catahna with
Dan Burns and other ofT-color politicians. He did
not have the courtesy to acknowledge the invitation
of the executive committee to assist in the welcome
to the California volunteers. He declined to pro
claim a legal holiday in honor of the return of the
troops, putting forward as reason for his refusal ..
desire that business should not be interrupted. His
conduct throughout has been marked by an utter dis
legard of the common civilities of life. To round
oft his career as a "war Governor," he sends out the
pompous Seamans with orders to change all the
plan; rif the celebration in order to exhibit himself
on land and water.
FARMERS AND EXPANSION.
THE best test of American opinion on impe
rialism is not to be found by polling the readers
of a newspaper on either side of the issue. A
paper as an advocate is sure to influence its constant
readers, and ii it call for an expression of judgment
among them a majority will surely be found with it.
Therefore the true way to find out what the people
arc thinking upon any matter of public importance
is by securing an expression from the readers of a
paper that has been non-partisan to the subject of
inquiry. In Massachusetts is published the most
widely circulated organ of the agricultural and hor
ticultural interests in the country. This journal, The
Farm and Home, recently sent out a postal card in
quiry in every section of the country among its sub
scribers, asking them to say whether they favored
independence and self-government for the Filipinos
or their subjection to us by conquest.. The answers
were as follows:
For i For
Independence. Subjection
New England 1,276 785
Middle States , 8,867 â¢ 2 343
Central West 4,901 3^102
Southern States 1,792 I]OS3
. Pacific Coast 1,684 l'lO3
Total 18,520 8,416
The vote stands, then, among the farmers by the
test so per cent more for independence than for con
quest and subjection.
The same paper then took another vote upon the
independence or annexation of Cuba, and it stood
13.199 for independence and only 7362 for annexation.
As in the case of the Philippines, every section gave
a majority for independence.
A third vote was taken on the question, "In gen
eral, should the United States adhere to or depart
from its former policy of non-interference with na
tions beyond either ocean?"
This is the issue of imperialism and anti-imperial
ism flat. The vote by sections. is very admonitory:
, . Adhere. Depart.
New England 1,578 291
Middle States 3,946 1203
Central West 6.179 1^204
The South 2,065 â¢ 817
Pacific Coast 1,856 572
Total... 15,624 4,087
So the vote is four to one against repudiating the
Declaration of Independence and abandoning, the
Monroe Doctrine. ' ; '
The passing applause which has greeted the ora
tors who have called the Declaration of Independence
an "absurdity" and "a damnable lie" is evidently not
expressive of the feelings of the sturdy rural popu
lation of the country. ' ,
The farmers do not believe that the country has
outgrown the constitution, and they evidently think
that when the flag is to be fought for it should repre
sent the principles for which it has stood from the
beginning.
The farmers are a thinking class, not easily ex-
THE SAN FItAlSr CISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 1899.
I
cited by pageantry or lifted oft their solid footing by
the tinselry of military glory. It is worthy of note
that the same and allied classes in Europe, sincere
admirers of our republican institutions, feel the same
way.
An American now traveling abroad writes to a
friend in New York that he talked with gentlemen in
Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow and many other places
in the British Isles to find among them a general
tone of regret that we should abandon our traditions
and so deprive the world of our good example, which
has been the inciting cause of all public reform in
Europe for a half century. He found among them
universal denial of our current and flippant claim
I that "trade follows the flag," for it follows only on
j better methods and cheaper production.
THE CONDITION OF CUBA-
IT seems to be assumed that officers of the regular
army are the proper judges of the civil policy of
this Government in the administration of the vari
ous islands upon which we are at present practicing.
The army idea carries invariably the necessity for
prolonged military occupation.
Lieutenant Kennon has recently made a report
! upon Cuba. He dwells at great length upon the re
sponsibility we have assumed for the government of
I that island. One learns from him that we are bound
to stay there until the people are fit to operate a gov
ernment such as has never yet existed among men.
All the people must be first educated, and there must
lie such order that crime and change are practically
[ unknown. To show how far away is this ideal condi
tion, he dwells upon the quality of the population.
I two-thirds negro and 83 per cent illiterate. From all
these facts Lieutenant Kennon instructs the people
of this republic that they owe to the world the duty
of keeping Cuba under the administration of a cap
tain-general and the army.
Will the people happen to remember that this army
officer repeats precisely the statements of the Span
ish army officers and gives the Spanish excuse for
I denying the self-government which the Cubans de
manded? because Spain would not yield to the Cu
| bans we impeached lier government, denied the valid
ity of the very reasons which Kennon now asks us
to accept as the foundation of our own policy, and
expelled her from the West Indies. We are no<v
asked to admit the truth of every Spanish claim
which we went to war to oppose. In a year remark
able for its usurpations, its inconsistencies and its
I dangers and dishonors, this demand of the army is
the most startling and the most unpleasant, since it
: cuts from under our feet the sole and only reason by
which we justified our war with Spain.
It maj' not occur to the army, but it will be re
membered by the people that there were just aa many
negroes in Cuba and the same percentage of illit
eracy when our people rushed into war to deliver
I them from military government and Congress de
| clared them to be free and of right independent. The
conditions of Cuba as to the races, and their morals
and merit-, composing her population have not
changed since the policy of this country was sol
emnly declared by Congress. The people intend to
adhere to that declaration. Congress was fully
aware of the condition of Cuba and needs no in
struction from Mr. Kennon. His report was ordered
by the War Department, and the affair looks as if
the army has concluded to go on and do as it pleases
with Cuba, regardless of Congress and the will of
the people. The design of the report is apparent in
its declaration that 75 per cent of the population
should not be trusted with the ballot. This is to
cloak a design for military restriction oi the ballot
and the permission of the franchise to one-fourth of
the people in order to get a vote for annexation and
set up the lying pretense that it is the wish of the
people. As this scheme develops -it will bear
watching.'
RECEPTION week begins to-day and promises
to be the most joyous festival in the annals of
San Francisco. Certainly the city has never
before been so beautifully adorned as it will be this
week, nor was there ever before so large a number
of people directly and warmly interested in any festal
movement of a public nature as in this one.
Contributions to the fund amounted on Saturday
evening to more than $48,000. That means the sum
asked for by the citizens' executive committee will
be given to the last dollar by a generous and pa
triotic people. The subscription, it is to be noted,
has been in every respect a popular one. There have
been comparatively few donations running up into
the thousands. The bulk of the money has come
in small sums and represents the offerings of the
mass of the people.
Unless some accident to the transport check her
progress or some adverse storm of the sea baffle her
in her course, the volunteers will enter the Golden
Gate about the middle of the week. The announce
ment of her arrival will be the signal for the pent-up
enthusiasm of the people to burst forth, and from
that time on it will flow with a full and roaring
strength until the hearts of all have been satisfied
and our heroic boys have been assured of the honor
in which they are held by their fellow citizens.
San Francisco prepares the welcome and defrays
the cost, but she wiH not be alone in the enjoyment
of it. Large numbers of people will come from the
farthest parts of the State to share in the greeting
to the men who in the far-off Philippines attested
the valor of California and the devotion of her sons
to the cause of the Union.
It is to be regretted that the Governor in his little
ness has not been able to comprehend the magnitude
of the popular fervor in the reception and has refused
to set apart one day of the reception as a public
holiday. Had a holiday been proclaimed the work
ing men and women of the city would have had full
freedom to join in the throngs that will cheer the
volunteers as they parade the streets and share in
the joy that will attend the concerts and illumina
tions that follow.
Since the Governor has refused to provide such
a legal holiday, it is the duty of citizens to make a
holiday for themselves. Certain industries must, of
cchirse, be carried on for public necessity and con
venience, but let all other offices, shops and stores
be closed on the day of the great parade, when the
reception festivities will culminate. It is not yet
I known on what day of the week the parade will fall,
j but as it does not occur until the second day after
the volunteers reach the port, ample time will be
given for all to arrange for it.
At this time all looks well for the success of every
feature of the reception. The decorations of the
streets will not be only profuse but artistic, and will
be the more pleasing because they will be to some ex
tent an expression of the sentiments of the Colorado
volunteers, now in the city, who have volunteere 1
to assist in arranging them. The management of the
military concerts, the fireworks, the feasts, the re
ceptions and all other parts of the festival are in good
hands and have been planned on a noble scale.
We will be ready for the boys when they come.
RECEPTION WEEK-
MINERS' LEGAL TROUBLES,
STATE LAW PROBLEM.
THE RED DOG SUIT.
SUBMARINE MINING
Along with the general new activity in !
the mining Industry in this State has sud
denly appeared a boom in mining law.
The miners of California have a variety
of important legal problems to interest
them and mining lawyers are sitting; up
nights calculating the range and velocity
of constitutions, Federal and State stat
utes and legal opinions, including their
own.
The big question of. whether the State
i mining law of 1897 is or is not in force
jis the chief one. Since the announcement
] in The Call a few days ago that Attorney
i A. H. Ricketts, chairman of the mineral
lands committee of the California Miners'
Association, had discovered a fatal blun
der in the. repealing act of March' 20, 1899,
and that the law remains in force, there
j has been a great deal of inquiry and dis
j cussion all over the State. During the
past week a number* of lawyers have
I formulated opinions on the grave question
i and a number of intelligent mining men
hare expressed lay opinions.
As is understood by those who have
given the matter attention the repealing
act as passed and approved reads: "An
! act to repeal 'an act etc.," is hereby re
| pealed." Had "entitled" been used in
stead of "to repeal." the intention of the
Legislature as expressed correctly in title
would have been accomplished. " As the
act reads it repeals "an act to repeal,"
and there was no such act to be repealed.
The whole question is, Can the court, un
der the rules and laws governing Judicial
construction of statutes, correct the blun
der by eliminating "to repeal" and read
ing "entitled" in its place? Mr. Ricketts'
opinion is that since the language is
clear and definite the court must accept i
the language as it stands, there being no
I ambiguity. Other mining attorneys hold
the same view.
But other lawyers as strongly hold that
the court may so correct the blunder.
i Judge J. M. Walling of Nevada City haÂ»
I written for the Nevada City Transcript
! a lengthy opinion to that effect. He cites
I numerous cases to support his contention
that "correcting a clear mistake of the
use of a wrong word in a statute is not
an assumption of legislative powers."
j In People vs. King, 23 Cal. 274, the Su
; preme Court substituted "296" for "293 "
I In ex-parte Hedley, 31 Cal. 108, "within"
was substituted for "without." The fol
lowing is another of the opinions of the
week :
Editor Call: In the Issue of The Call of the
12th inst. a lengthy and instructive article ap
peared relating to the act. repealing the min
ing location law of 1897. This article has given
rise to a good deal of speculation and inquiry
as to the present status of the laws of this
State governing the subject. Mr. Ricketts an.l
authorities are quoted to enow the law of 1n97
ifs still in force. I have received an inquiry
as to the effect of the repealing act and have
advised that it repealed the act of 1897. By
reference to the title of the act, chapter CXIII,
page 148, Stats. 1599. It will be seen that the
act of March 27, 1597, was that which the
act repeals, though section 1, of the repealing
act, reads: "An act to repeal." etc., instead
of "An act entitled an act,'-' etc. It was held
in Savings Bank vs. Burns, 104 Cal., 478, that
where the act Is ambiguous and of doubtful
meaning or application, it Is competent to look
to the title of the act and to read it in con
nection with the body of the repealing ail
to determine the intention of the legislative
body, and a similar act was upheld. This
decision of our Supreme Court fellows those
of the United States Supreme Court in Myer
vs. Western Car Co.. 102 U. 9 . 1, and Wilson
; vs. Sp&ulding. 19 Fed. Hep., 304. So that read-
Ing the title and the body of the act together
! It is plain what the legislative intention was,
though crudely expressed, and the conclusion
follows that the act of March 27. 1597, atands
i repealed." K. M. GAL.VI.V
Mr. Ricketts admits Mr. Galvin's argu-
m ent as far as it goes, but holds that in
i this case there Is no ambiguity and doubt-
I ful meaning. Judge Walling does not
I take the title Into account at all. Be-
I sides the raging conflicts of lawyers there
| are many miners who are being, sustained
! by a faith that if the Federal law is com
i plied with substantially and in good faith,
! justice will somehow preserve mining lo
' cations to those who didn't know that a
i State law was also in force. Such faith
! is probably confounded, for if a State law
! is in force and is valid It must be com
plied with. Many cases involving mil
lions have turned on the location and re
cording of claims according to district
rules and regulations. If States and dis
tricts may supplement the Federal re
quirements, as the Federal law distinctly
allows, ignorance of their existence would
appear of no more protection than igno
rance of the Federal law Itself.
When the doctors of the law disagree
so widely we will have to wait and see
what the Supreme Court says about it.
Meantime locators should carefully ob
serve both the Federal and State laws
and the laws of their mining districts if
I there are any. Claims located since the
supposed repeal last spring should be
promptly relocated according to the State
law. which miners all over the State are
busily looking up.
Through his close study of the law in
the past few days Mr. Ricketts has dis
covered something else new, he believes.
i It is that the requirement in the State law
I of $50 worth of work in sixty days is in
! valid anyway. He holds that it is in con
! flict with the Federal law because the
latter allows a locator to hold a claim by
doing $100 worth of work by the end of the
calendar year after the one In which the
location is made. It is the time and not
the assessment that Is Invalid, he holds.
The State may require additional assess
ment work and regulate the manner of re
cording, etc.. but the additional assess
ment work must accompany the , time
specified in the Federal law. If this view
is correct, another trouble will be on hand
1 If the State law is held to be in force.
Besides the State law muddle the'
I miners have the validity of the Camlnetti
law on hand in the injunction suit re
cently brought by the Anti-Debris Asso
ciation, in the name of Sutter County,
against the Red Dog hydraulic mine of
Nevada County. This mine has been
operating behind a restraining dam
built according to specifications approved
by the Federal engineers composing the
California Debris Commission, and in-
I spected and licensed by them. The suit
asks that the mine be enjoined notwith-
I standing the -approval of the California
Debris Commission, and thus the vital
feature of the Caminettl law which puts
exclusive control of hydraulic mining on
the watersheds of the navigable streams
of this State in the hands of the commis
sion, is assailed. If the Red Dog mine
may be enjoined, any other hydraulic
mine may be shut down at the discretion
of a court, and the discretion of the en
; gineers goes for nothing.
As this is a test case, the California
: Miners' Association will defend the suit
j vigorously in the interest of the industry,
and the Red Dog Mining Company has
i resigned control of the defense to the
| association. Last week the committee re
| cently appointed to provide counsel en-
I gaged C. W. Cross, who will direct the
i defense. The suit was recently trans
ferred to the United States Circuit Court
by the Superior. Court of Sutter County,
and has now been remanded to Sutter
County, where It will first be heard. The
litigation promises to be long and hard-
I fought, and the California Miners" Asso-
I ciation will probably spend several
thousand dollars in the defense. Hence It
will need money, and the County Miners'
Associations will be asked at their ap
proaching conventions to contribute
liberal amounts to the fund.
There is another field In which impor
tant legal problems arise. One of the most
interesting questions that ever came up
in the field of mining law is presented for
the first time by the oil operations in the
tide lands and ocean- bed along the south
ern coast of the State. At Summerland
the inclined oil stratum was found to
pitch out under the sea, and wharves were
| built across the strip of tide land and for
j several hundred feet out into the ocean.
From these wharves many wells have
been sunk, and oil is now being pumped
from under the ocean, as is done nowhere
else in the world. This success at Sum
merland has started prospecting for simi
lar oil lines, along the Santa Barbara
shore, and Is talked of elsewhere. Recent
l ly a nocturnal vigilance committee tore
down a derrick on the shore in front of a
i residence suburb, and Shotguns were
talked of. The law of this situation' has
been talked about, but not settled, and the
questions have not yet got into court as
they likely will. , '

â I
on the tide lands of the State and in the â¢
ocean bed? If a rich quartz ledge vas
found to extend out under the ocea-i 1
could be followed there by tunnelir m
a shuft, how could it be approprla^ xna
held? Is the ocean bed for three .lies
seaward the public domain, and r AO a
lode location be made under the Beaerai,
law, and how? In the case of an oil j
formation, like that at Summerland, cou d ;
a placer location be made, a* on land. ,
If a man or company bores an cil well
in the sea, how can he maintain his pos
session if legally or forcibly assailed.
These interesting questions do not ap
pear to have ever arisen before, as mm- :
ing has in the past never been carried on ,
at sea. The problem was recently offered .
to Attorney A. H. Ricketts, who has long
made a specialty of mining law, and he
pronounced it the most interesting ana
novel legal question he had encountered ,
and proceeded to study it. He has reached
some conclusions that will be of general
interest. , , , .1
Ho decides, for one thing, that the bed ,
of the ocean to the three-mile limit is the
property of the State. The Federal mm- ;
ing laws do not apply, as they do not to
the tide landsâ the strip of shore between
high and low water mark. The State tea
never in any manner provided for the j
mining use of this State domain, and one
who mines there is technically a tres
passer and mines by sufferance of the j
State, which could eject him. The mm- .
prals belong to the first one who gets them
as long as the State does not assert con
trol. An oil wharf or derrick might be
condemned by a court as a nuisance, pri- :
vate or public. The State mining law, if
not repealed, would not apply, because it
applies to the "public domain of the
United States.' The United States con-!
trols those navigable waters, but not the
sea iH'ttom, and might condemn an in
terference with navigation.
The State is also held to own the beds j
of the navigable streams, the navigation;
of which is controlled by the United
States. Therefore the beds of such ;
streams as the Sacramento and "naviga- i
ble" tributaries cannot be located and hold !
as placer claims, to be worked by wing I
damming or dredging. These and other I
opinions have been expressed In part in
the following, written by Mr. Ricketts for i
The Call:
"The several States are the absolute |
owners of navigable waters and the soils
under the same, within their respective ;
borders, subject to the paramount right |
of navigation, the regulation of which in !
certain respects is granted to the I'nitedi
States. This right of the States to the ;
soils under navigable waters i.s not derived
by grant or patent from the United States,
and if mineral in character are not sub- â¢
ject to exclusion as mineral lands of the i
public domain, which are reserved in all j
land grants of Congress to the States, j
etc., but was reserved to the thirteen |
original States, which became sovereign ;
when the Revolution took place. The act
of Congress admitting California to the |
Union declares that she is admitted on
equal footing in all respects with the
original States.
"The navigable streams within this
State are public highways, are for the use 1
of the people of the State, and obstruc
tions placed therein impairing the public I
right incident to the use of such waters
are public nuisances which no lapse of !
time <-an legalize. In my opinion the State '
has the sole right to regulate the mining j
of the beds of such streams, as well as
the beds of all other navigable waters I
within its territorial limits, the provisions
of the Untied States mining laws not be-!
ing applicable to mineral deposits found
therein, as the paramount title to the !
beds of such streams and other navigable |
waters has never been in the United ;
States.
"In the absence of am- grant ot per
mission from the State to remove the min
erals from such ground the person doing 1
bo is a trespasser against whom an action 1
in ejectment would lie at the instance of
the State just as well as if the mining 1
was done upon dry land. Such person j
may also be enjoined from the prosecution |
of such work and may be compelled to
respond in damages. But, as against 1
every one but the State, the appropriator !
is the owner of the minerals Be extracts j
from such soils; for, as one law writer !
puts it, 'they are like the fish in the
water, the property of him who takes
them.'
"While there are certain provisions af
fecting the sale of tidelands to be found
in the constitution and laws of this State, j
it may b* stated as a general proposition
that lands on the shore of the ocean be- I
tween high and low-water mark every
where in this State cannot become the
subject of private ownership.
"The boundary of this State (substan
tially like those of Oregon, Washington
and Massachusetts, hut not liko those of
Texas and Alabama, which extend three j
and six leagues, respectively, into navi- 1
gable waters) is extended under its con
stitution Into the Pacific Ocean a dis
tance of three English miles. Over such
waters the United States exercises do
minion for the purposes or protection
from invasion, the regulation of naviga
tion, etc.: and all nations have also a,
common right to use the same for the
gurpose of commerce notwithstanding the
tate's assertion of ownership.
"Subject to such rights a State has the
right to determine the extent of its owner
ship of the soils under "navigable waters,"
including in that term what is com
monly called the 'open sea." Therefore
the lied of the Pacific Ocean for a dis
tance of three English miles along the
shore of this State is within its borders;
and it follows that the title to the same
Is in the State of California.
"The necessary conclusion is that no
person can legally acquire any rights
to mine the same without the consent of
the State, and such concession, if grant
ed, must be made and held subject to
the paramount right of the navigator."
"The maintaining of dredgers in navi
gable rivers of this State, the building
of wharves into the ocean to facilitate
the extraction of petroleum, etc.. and the
erection of derricks thereon is without
warrant of law." says Mr. Ricketts.
Not only could the trespasser be eject
ed by the State, but his wharf would be- j
long to the State. Tho statutes governing â 
the abatement of nuisances apply. One !
who has possession may hold it as against '
other individuals and he may kr>ep the j
minerals !f he can get them, as he may
keep fiah caueht from his wharf. It is
possible that any one might remove one
of these outcast derricks subject to the
laws governing the public peace.
The beds of the rivers of California
are golden and there is a boom in rjolil
dredging. This and other things make
the legal problems raised of practical
importance as well as of theoretical in- I
terest. The legal status of beach mines i
where the sand below high-water mark j
is worked is involved. Many related prnb- I
lems easily occur In following out the i
theories advanced by Mr. Ricketts
Whnt is here given is not, of course I
stated through any desire to discourage I
or unnecessarily trouble any one engaged !
in the promising mining enterprises con- '<
cerned. but as a simple speculative nre- '
sentation of an Interesting situation which I
needs to be understood and which will
likely result in State legislation on the
mining use of State property.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
Russia has set apart 54.5W.000 for tna
construction of a harbor at Alexandrow
ski. in Saghalien, in order to provide the
eastern squadron with its own coal and to
make Port Arthur and Ta-lien-wan inde
pendent of Japanese and English sources.
The Vulcan Engineering and Ship
building Works at Stettin. Germany, is
rapidly coming to the front as one of
the principal naval yards. It was found
ed in 1552. with a capital stock of $750. 000.
which has been increased to $2,000,000. A
heavy reserve fund is kept, and the cap
ital stock does not in reality Indicate the
progress of the concern. The plant was
valued at $47fi.000 in 1867, and its value
now is $4,500,000. The Vulcan works
have built 247 vessels since 1852. of which
61 were naval, and it has now on the
stocks two war vessels of 1fi.350 tons and
36.000 horsepower, and six merchant
steamers of 7Â».0OO tons and 74.000 horse
power. The works employ about 6000
men.
The docking facilities of the British
navy are far superior to those of any
naval power. The Government owns
forty-one drydocks in Its six naval sta
tions at home, four at Malta and three
under construction at Gibraltar, making
a total of forty-eight in European wa
ters. It also owns sixteen docks In Its
possessions abroad, namely: three In
North America, one at Bermuda, three
in Australia and nine In the East Indies.
The recent naval estimates provide for
one large dock at Chatham, two at Malta
of 790 and 530 fc-et length, one at Timons
Bay 750 feet In length, a smaller dock
at Hongkong and a 550-foot floating
dock at Bermuda. These new docks will
probably be completed within two years,
and Great Britain will then have seventy
drydocks reserved exclusively for naval
vessels. The number of Government
docks in the United States is only ten
actually built and four in course of con
struction, to be completed within two
years. Three of those already built are
useless at present owing to defect? in
construction, and only two docks are of
sufficient size to take in any of the
large battleships.
During the recent British naval ma
r.puvers twenty-four vessels of one of
the fleets were tested as to their speed,
on which the admiral could rely upon
during the forthcoming operations. The
sea was calm, and the ships steamed un
der three-fifths power, with results as
shown in the appended table. To facili
tate comparison between trial speed and
speed under three-fifths power, it must
be explained that the first is under full
power, and that a reduction of two
thirds power causes a diminuition of
speed in the vessels named of about one
knot:
It seems evident from the foregoing
speed figures that none of the battleships
would come within a knot and a half
of their trial speed if tried under full
power. The new cruisers came up fairly
to the mark, but those built prior to IS?S
appear very deficient, and all except the
Sybllle and Terpsichore are decidedly
slow, while the Thames, Aeolus, Mersey
and Arethusa are failures. One of the
causes for this falling off in speed is the
fact that the ships were under service
conditions, with bunkers full and draw
ing a couple of feet more than when thÂ«y
passed through their acceptance trials.

NAVAJO INDIANS KILL
AND SCALP A WHITE
Troops Ordered Out to Quell an Arizona
Uprising Caused by a Gambler's
Cheating.
"WINSLOW, Ariz., Aug. 20. â Two hundred Indiana In Foreman
Minks' grading gang at Navajo Springs, Ariz., seventy-five miles
east of here, are threatening to exterminate all the whites In that
section. They were paid off on the 15th and proceeded to gamble and
drink heavily. A gambler named C. H. Landreth cheated them, and
when they remonstrated he assaulted one, shooting and stabbing him
seriously. The tribe armed themselves with all the weapons In the
camp, shot the gambler seven times, scalped him and mutilated his
body beyond recognition.
Troops from Fort Wingate will be on the scene by to-morrow. Seri
ous trouble cannot be averted, as the Indians are plentifully supplied
with whisky from some source, and vow vengeance on all the whites.
The camp is deserted. Campfires can be seen on the hills for miles
around. Delegations of Indians from the Fort Defiance Indian Agency
are on their way to Navajo Springs. C. N. Cotton, the Indian trader,
is expected soon to assist In bringing about a peaceful settlement.
Deputy Sheriff J. B. Stockwell of Navajo County has surrounded the
station with deputies to prevent another attack until the troops from
Fort Wingate arrive. A supply of arms goes to Navajo Springs from
Winslow to-night. The troops from Fort Wingate bring provisions and
ammunition for a forced march Into the enemy's camp at once.
With the reinforcements from other agencies the Indian force will be
over five hundred and most of the men are armed. Ammunition is
plentiful, and being well supplied with money at this time, It will be no
trouble for the Indians to withstand a long siege in their stronghold In
the mountains north and east of Navajo Springs. Water is hard to get
and pursuit into their encampment will be attended by great hardships
and privatic-ns. It has not yet been determined where the troops will
start first, as the Indians are well prepared to resist any moderate force.
Important developments will no doubt transpire when the troops arrive
one the scene of action.

of Having Violated Fish
ing Laws.
EVAXSVILLE, Ind.. Aug. 20.â A
i trial, conviction and fine by long-dis
j tance telephone were recorded in
j Evansville last evening. Edward Ruf
! fler, a fireman on the Evansville and

! caught seining the waters near Prince
ton.
Yesterday Deputy Fish Commissioner
Earle quietly slipped into this city,
placed Ruffler under arrest and was
about to carry him back to Princeton
when Ruffler protested, sayinrr: "Why.
I can't go to^Princeton. I am a rail
road man and can't get away. I'll lose
my job." The deputy thought for a
moment and suddenly said he would
have Ruffler tried by . telephone. A
long-distance telephc-ne was then re
sorted to and the Princeton Justice of
the Peace called up. Ruffler pleaded
guilty and the Justice announced that
he should pay a fine of $5 and costs in
the case. The money was delivered to
Deputy Earle ano" Ruffler was given
his freedom. He then hurried to the
depot to catch his train.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 21. 1899.
DRIVING YAQUIS TO
THE MOUNTAINS
Latest Move of General
Torres.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BACATET, Mexico, Aug. 18 (via Po
toma, Mexico, Aug. 20).â The situation
along the Yaqui River from Medano to
Torrin has now reached its most crit
ical period. The Indians have com
menced their passage to the Pitaya and
Bacatet. The main body of the warriors
are reported to be in the vicinity south
of Bacum, while the remainder of them
are scattered through the woods as far
down the river as Medano in small
bands numbering from four to fifty.
The inhabitants keep themselves close
â within the town limits and especially
the peaceable Yaqui element. A small
band of renegades approached the river
bank opposite Potam yesterday after
noon and made an effort to drive off
some mules, but were discovered and
retreated. General Torres' entire field
command is now at Chumampaco, four
miles above Torrin.
The general's next move will be to
send out an advance column to a favor
ite watering place of the Yaquis. Other
detachments which will follow are in
tended to form a line across the four
miles of woods along the river. An ad
vance will then be made down the val
ley almost to the sea, with the purpose
of clearing the valley of the enemy. It
is the opinion of many who know the
Yaquis well that this removal of the
scene of hostilities to the mountains
will be more advantageous to the In
dians than to the troops.
A detachment of the Seventeenth
Regiment under Captain Morales leaves
Potam this morning for Chumampaco,
and 100 men of the Eleventh will start
in the morning for the same destina
tion. The total number of soldiers now
on the Yaqui River is 3500. About 1200
of these are in the field and the rest
stationed at different points along the
river doing garrison and other duties.
The Don Lorrenza, a small steamer
plying between Potam and General
Torres' camp, was attacked by the
Yaquis Tuesday, but got away with one
killed. Captain McDonald, a Scotch
man, well known in El Paso, was
wounded in the shoulder during the
skirmish. General Torres is so far re
covered from the wound in his thigh
that he expects to take the field again
within ten days.
One hundred volunteers have been
organized in Hermosillo and will leave
for the front via Batamotal.
The soldiers of the Seventeenth ar
rived in Potam on their march to join
General Torres, whose command left
the lower river yesterday from Torrin,
and they will be given three days for
a much-needed rest. They are footsore
and sick and bordering on the condition
of being entirely unfit for duty.
It has been found the machine guns,
of which so much was expected, are a
complete failure in the flat jungle river
country, as the Indians usually fight
in small bands when they enter the
mountains. The guns are expected to
be of little service there also. In the
last engagement the troops fought with
a Colt's automatic gun, which was
brought into action, but was broken by
untrained hands before it was felt by
the enemy.
THIRTY INJURED.
Terrible Results of a Collision Be
tween Trolley Cars.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 20.-A head-on
collision between two trolley cars occur
red to-day on the Norristown and Chest
nut Hill and Roxborough Railway, in Ply
mouth Township. Thirty persons were
Injured. The following are believed to be
fatally hurt:
John Parsons. Philadelphia, internal in
juries and several ribs broken; William
Hartstine, "West Point, Pa., internal In
juries and ribs broken; Mrs. Bridget Nu
nan, seriously injured about the body.
Others badly hurt, but not fatally in
jured are:
Mrs. Julia Moeslin, Norristown, and
Miss Alice McGuigan. Philadelphia.
The railway is a single track road with
switches. The passengers of the south
bound car assert that the motorman fail
ed to wait at the switch for the arrival
of the car going north and the accident
resulted.
TRIPLE EXECUTION OF
DAWSON MURDERERS
SEATTLE, Aug. 20.â Passengers of the steamer City of Topeka,
which arrived to-night from Skaguay, Alaska, bring news of the first
legal execution in the Klondike. A triple hanging occurred at Dawson
on August 4. The men hanged were two Indiansâ Dawson Nantuck
and Jim Nantuckâ and one white man, Edward Henderson.
Henderson was convicted of having murdered his partner, named
Peterson, on the trail near Marsh Lake in September, 1897. The Indians
were convicted of the murder of William Mahan and the injuring of his
partner. James Fox, on the McClintock River in May, 1838. There were
originally four Indians implicated in the murder of Mahan, but two of
them died in jail at Dawson last fall.
The execution was private and passed off without special incident.
ROMANTIC TALE
OF THE WEST
A Wealthy Cattleman
Wins a Bride.
MRS. BUDD OF THIS STATE
SHE WILL SHORTLY WED JOHN
L CLARE OF TEXAS.
The Lady Is Well Known In Califor
nia, Being the Owner of Exten
sive Orange Groves and
Very Wealthy.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 20.â John
I. Clare of Texas, one of the great cat
tle kings of the West, and Mrs. B. G.
Budd, a California woman with a mil
lion or more in her own right, are to
be married at the Baltimore Hotel here
September 5, and thereby hangs a ro
mantic tale. Two years ago Clare was
attending the big convention of stock
men in San Antonio. Among the spec
tators v. as a fine-looking woman. She
was Mrs. Budd of Riverside, Cal., own
er of vast oranffe groves and inheritor
of a fortune left her by her father, a
Frenchman of noble birth, who came
to this country many years ago and
purchased estates in Virginia, whence
he moved later to New Orleans. When
the cattle king arose to make a speech
in the San Antonio convention the
black eyes of Mrs. Budd met his, and
that was the beginning of the end.
It was a case of love at first sight.
They met and saw each other many
times after that. The orange groves
were sold and six months ago Mrs.
Budd came to Kansas City to prepare
for the wedding. Meanwhile she
startled people by the magnificent cos- j
fumes she wore at the theater and else
where. And she startled the managers
of one of the largest dry-goods estab
lishments in town by making purchases
amounting to several thousand dollars
and paying for them in cash. Her
wedding gown alone cost more than j
$1000. The heavy cream satin is cov
ered with yards and yards of real lace
that cost $35 a yard, and strings of
real pearls.
The wedding will be a most magnifl- i
cent one. It will outdo the recent
Flood-Fritz affair, if carried out as
planned. Clarissa Hess will be the j
maid of honor. After the wedding the j
couple will leave for a tour of the
West, and then return to Kansas City
to live.
SERIOUS RUNAWAYS
IN MARIN COUNTY
W. B. Larzelere and Wife Injured
and Charley de Young's Filly
Badly Cut.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 20.â While rid
ing In company with his wife to-day
W. R. Larzelere. the San Francisco
commission merchant, met with an ac
cident that might have resulted fatally
had it not been for the bravery of
Joseph Kelly and Joseph Hermann. As
it was, both Larzelere and his wife were
badly bruised by being thrown out of
their vehicle onto a concrete pave
ment.
The runaway was caused by Larze
lere trying to cross the broad-gauge
track near the depot in front of a mov
ing train. The horses took fright and
dashed into the side of Kelly's stable.
Both horses were knocked dowij by the
impact with the brick wall and one
was injured so badly it will probably
have to be shot. Mrs. Larzelere was
thrown over the dashboard between the
two horses and was rescued by Kelly,
who was badly lamed, one of the horses
kicking him on the right leg. Larze
lere, who was stunned by his fall, was
gotten out of harm's way by Hermann
and the frightened horse that remained
uninjured broueht under control. The
vehicle was completely wrecked.
Runaways have been common in
Marln County lately. Last night a
stable boy took the sorrel filly Sweet
heart, on which Charley de Young has
won several paper chases, out of M. H.
de Young's stable, and hitching her to
a buggy, crowded three companions
into the vehicle and went to Larkspur.
There the company became intoxicated
and on their return home were thrown
out by the filly running away. She ran
into a barbed-wire fence and sustained
several cuts on the legs and breast,
which were dressed by Dr. Masero. It
was rumored that the valuable animal
was so badly injured that she would
have to be killed, but Mr. de Young as
serts that the injuries are not serious.
The owner was in Belvedere at the time
of the accident and was considerably
surprised at the filly being taken out of
the stable. Investigation showed that
it occurred white the coachman was
absent.

THOUSANDS AT THE GAME
LOCALS HAD CONTEST WON UP
TO LAST INNING.
Catcher Stanley and Umpire Graves
Met in a Limited Contest â A
Drawâ" Truck" Eagan Re
ceives Flowers.
Over 7000 hooting, howling, shrieking
baseball enthusiasts filled the grandstand
and "bleachers" at Recreation Park yes
terday afternoon to see the final game of
the series between Kripp's Sacramento
stick-wielders and the local team. Twice
In two days had Hank Harris' nine wasp
like young men gone down before the
prowess of the "Brewers," and they tried
hard to redeem themselves. The fates
were against them. Playing a faultless
game, with the score standing 1 to 0 in
their favor, Kripp's crew of nine smashed
out two runs in their half of the ninth,
and Uncle wept again.
The bright particular stars of the day
were "Truck. Eagan and Mat Stanley.
â Truck," be'eause he was presented with
a handsome floral baggage truck as he
stepped to the plate the first time, and
Stanley for deciding to take a fall out of
Umpire Graves and then changing his
mind. The latter little episode occurred
in the ninth inning, when the Sacramc ntos
were most in need of runs. Eagan lined one
to right field and reached first. Next at
the bat, Stanley bunted, beating the
sphere to first. "Orator" O'Neil claimed
the ball rolled foul, and Graves so decided.
Stanley came back to dispute the ruling |
of the umpire, and to make his talk per
suasive shoot the letter's mask. It is quite
evident Mr. Graves will "stick" when oc- 1
casion requires it. Snatching the wire
cage from his head he swung right and
left at Stanley until restrained by some
of the other players. in an Instant pande
monium reigned, and several officers ap
peared on the scene. However, Stanley
picked up his bat, Graves regretted and
the Incident was soon history.
The game was really a pitchers' battle,
both "Silent" Harvey and "Fireman'
Pitapatrick receiving perfect support. The
former struck out four men, while three
of the Sacramentos failed to connect with
the "Fireman's" curves. The locals played
an errorless game, with but two misplays
charged to the opposing team.
The lone run recorded in favor of Uncle
Hank's players was made by Krug in
the first inning. Hit by pitcher, he made
a circuit of the bags on wild throws of
Stanley and Shanahan. The former en
deavored to catch Krug at second on a
steal, and the outfielder threw wild in an
attempt to nail "Helny" at the corner.
For the victors the wicked smash from
Shanahan's bat, sending the ball to cen
ter, brought in the winning run. Bag
had already reach, d the home plate on
Doyle's two-bagger, and when Bnanahan
made connections Doyle scampered in
amid a scene of wild confusion.

Sacramento 8, San Francisco 6.
The morning game at Freeman's Park.
Berkeley, b< tween the Sacramento and
San Francisco teams was a very spirited
contest, resulting In a victory for the
former hy a score of 8 to G. The cranks,
who were out in full force, filling the un
pretentious grand stand to overflowing.
were treated to a lurid exhibition of the
nal game, interspersed with fre
quent spells of jangling and wrangling.
In the owning inning the San Francis
cos, first at bat, touched up the delivery
of Doyle early and often, rolling up four
runF before O'Neil finally retired the side
with a hit that Eagan gathered in. In
the inning following one more run was
counted up. Sacramento scored one In
the flrÃt
Then followed the eventful third In
ning, in which Sacramento pulled the
gamo from the coals, creating at the same
time a big "kick." Missel DallS by Josh
Kik-y and Swindells allowed Doyle and
Stultz to tcore, which, Added to runs
made by O'Connor, Eagan. Merit-fee and
BheÂ«han piled up a total of six. After
this Harris' men tried hard, but could
get l>ut one man over the plate.

Started B warm argument in the third
inning after Doyle and Stultz had scored.
O'Neil claitned the ball fielded by Hiley
and mnffcl by Swindells at the plate was
a "blocked ball," but Levy failed to ob
. Interference, and the claim
was disallowed. For his persistent and
threatening oratorical efforts O'Neil was
ordered out of the game and fincl $?<.
I' :,<â¢ was moved to second, and Fitzpat

San Francisco Yachtsmen Hold a
Trial of Speed From Mare Island
to Clubhouse at Sau
salita. Â»""â¢'â¢,'/. "
H. R. Simpkins' new yawl Tramontana
entered her first race yesterday and won
two prize flags. The race between the
yawl and G. E. Billings' sloop Nixie was
close and exciting, the yawl crossing the
finishing line In front of the San Fran
cisco clubhouse 1 minute 57 seconds ahead
of her rival. The Tramontana won the
flag for crossing the finishing line first,
and also that for making the fastest time
down from Vallejo to Sausalito. Her time
for the trip was 3 hours 37 minutes 36
seconds. I. Gutte's schooner Chispa made
the next best time, finishing in 'â * hours 43
minutes 45 seconds.
The San Francisco Yacht Club's trial of
speed from Vallejo to Sausalito on May 21
was Be successful and excited so much In
terest that Commodore Hill decided to call
off the annual regatta over the triangular
course in front of the clubhouse at bau
salito and substitute for it a second cruise
from Vallejo. On May 21 the finish be
tween the schooners Aggie. i,urllne and
Ramona was the leading feature of the
race, but on this occasion neither J. D.
Spreckels' Lurline nor E. A. Wlltsee's
Aggie started. The event of yesterday,
however, had a strong element of Interest
H. R. Simpkins' yawl Tramontana, which
sailed her maiden race and proved herself
! a speedy craft. O. E. Billings' sloop Is'lxle
finished less than two minutes after the
1 Winner, nnd I. Qutte's ciiispa finished less
than six minutes later than the Nixie. Dr.
A. YV. McKtr.zff's sloop Sappho and Com
modore T. L. Hill's sloop CygnUÃ made a
close race, the flagship finishing only
sixty-one seconds later than the. Sappho.
Thrri- was a large fleet of yaCuiS at Val-
I lejo on Saturday night, the Ban Francis
-1 cos contributing the schooners Chispa,
Outing and Ramona, the yawls Frolic and
Tramontana and the sloops Cygnus and
Thetis. \V. Woods' sloÂ«p Angela also lay
at anohnr off Vallejo. Several Corinthian
! yachts escorted the flagship Aeolus and
tli" Bloops Mignon and Edna, which start
ed yesterday morning on a cruise up river
to Mare Island. Among these were the
yawl Arcturua and the sloops Freda,
; Presto and Jessie A. The California sloop
1 Embla was also on hand, but her rival,
j Commodore A. M. Clay's Pactolus, v.Â»d
; not put in an appearance though arrange
ments had been made for them to join the
cruise nf the San Franciscns.
The fleet beat out of Mare Island Straits
1 under a good breeze, which freshened
' considerably in San Pablo Bay. The early
' part of the' race was against a flood tide,
and. strong as the wlnn was. the sea did
not run high. Commodore Hill and G. E.
I Billings made over toward the Marin
| shore, hoping to find a stronger breeze
; there, but the rest of the fleet hugged
! the Contra Costa shore and made better
time by doing so. The flagship Cvgnus
! carried full sail all through, and though
1 the turnbuekle on her port backstay part
i ed, and later the traveler of her main
boom was wrenched from the deck on the
; starboard side, the damage was quickly
repaired and caused little or no delay. On
! nearing Sausalito the commodore, mis
taking the position of the stakeboat. held
;on too long before putting about and
failed to beat out the Sappho.

ROYAL FLUSH A WINNER.
SHOOTING ON THE RANGES
ROYAL FLUSH IS
A STAKE WINNER
AT UNION PARK
Is Favored by Luck
Throughout.
BEATS GLADIATOR BY CHANCE
D. J. HEALEY'S GRENADA IS THE
BEST OF THE PUPPIES.
With Strong Hares and the Fleetest
of Dogs. High Class Sport Is
Presented at the Two
Parks.
The fortunes of coursing were in evi
dence many times at Union Park yester
day. This was particularly so in the semi
final rcund of the open stake when the
faster dog was beaten in two instances.
Flyaway had the speed of For Glory, but
th.- hare turned back to the latter arid the
course was over before Flyaway could re
cover the ground she had lost. The next
round was run under the same conditions,
J. Dean's great dog Gladiator losing to
Royal Flush. Gladiator led, but the hare
turned to Royal Flush and his opponent
threw up his head unsighted. From thai
on until the kill Flush did all the work
and secured the decision. Gladiator was
running in excellent form and was a most
likely candidate for the stake.
The final was between Royal Flush and
For Glory. . The latter is a mite of a
greyhound and had punishing courses
throughout the day. On the other hand
Flush had been favored with compara
tively short courses and was full of run
ning. When they met Flush led up and
scored the first time. He let For Glory
in for a few wrenches and then killed,
winning the stake from F. A. McComb.
D. J. Heal i Grenada, by Rusty Gold-
Wave, the prohibitive favorite tor the
puppy stake, won handily. He led
Wanda from slips, and although the De
Lopez representative drew level in the run
up Grenada secured the first turn and
killed, winning the stake.
Judge Bull erred in the course between â¢
Lawrence and Statesman in the second
round. The former won in a fairly even
course which the judge called a "no-go."
When the dogs were slipped for the sec
ond time there was nothing to the course
except Statesman, who won all the way.
The judge gave the decision to Lawrence,
possibly to make amends for his decision
when they met previously. The runs were
as follows:

Shamrock Has Fin Keel.
NEW YORK. Aug. 21.-The Tribune
says: The sailors on the Shamrock are
not so secretive as the owners of the
boat. One of them said yesterday that
the Shamrock was a fin-keel boat, built
much on the lines of Emperor William's
Meteor. There is nothing about her
smooth deck to indicate that she carries
a center-board.

Edward Rockhill Shot
by His Wife.
SHE CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE
SAYS HE STABBED HER WITH
A BUTCHER KNIFE.
Almost Fatal Sequel to a Row That
Started Over a Woman's Re
fusal to Cook Turkey Din
ner Last Thanksgiving.
Oakland office Ban Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 20.
The bitter aftermath or nn Incident that
occurred last Thanksgiving day, when
Mrs. Edward Rockhill refused to serve
her husband with a turkey dinner, almost
culminated in a murder this morning at
their home, corner of Forty-third and
Linden streets.
The climax of Mr. and Mrs. Rockhill's
domestic troubles -was signaled by the
loud report of a shotgun In their barn
shortly aft( r the couple had engaged In a
desperate encounter at the breakfast
table, in which Rockhill claims his wife
attempted to assassinate him with a
kitchen butcher-knife.
Later the wife went to the barn. The
husband followed her, and while he was
standing in the barn doorway the infuri
ated woman leveled a shotgun at him and
fired the contents of one barrel, a goodly
portion of the charge of No. â "â  shot lodg
ing In Rockhlll's left shoulder.
Without attempting to renew the strug
gle the injured husband ran for his life.
scaled fences and finally escaped.
Neighbors summoned the police and
Rockhill was t.iken to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Stratton dressed the
wounds, which were pronounced not seri
ous. About thirty shot had penetrated
the flesh. He was later taken to the City
Prison, where he will be held awaiting
further developments.
Mrs.v Rockhill went to her room after
firing the shot and had Dr. Depue of
Golden (iate summoned. She was treated
for several incised wounds on her chest
and hark which she declares were inflicted
by her husband. She was not arrested.
"My husband has treated me brutally
for a long time." said Mrs. Rockhill this
afternoon, "and I could stand it no longer.
1 ran first to the neighbors and then to
our barn for protection, and had to defend
mv life against him."
Several of the neighbors aver that the
husband had frequently handled her
roughly and that only this morning he
chased her from the house and threatened
her.
Rockhili declares that trouble has been
brewing between himself and his wife for
several years.
"My wife has a terrible temper." he said
aftf-r being locked up in the City Prison,
"and this morning at breakfast she quar
reled because I nad gone out to get a
ilrink. She picked up a butcher-knife and
threatened to carve me. I wrestled with
her nd !lna.lly wrenched the knife from
lit grasp. If she is cut at all it must
have happened while we were struggling,
for I had no intention of injuring her.
Afterward she went to the barn, and
wh*-n I opened the door, telling her to
come out and go into the house and be
have herself, she stood In the horse stall,
and before I knew it leveled the shotgun
and fired. I knew I was hit, and ran for
my life. If she files an information
against me I'll do the same against her.
I can bring witnesses to prove that she Is
In the wrong. I'll never spend another
night in that house with her.
"Thf whole trouble was caused over a
?iri named Arelia, the fifteen-year-old
laughter of my wife's sister. My wife
las always devoted more time to directing
his girl in her dancing for the stage than
:o her- household duties. This girl has
'topped with us for years, and when she
law me shot she said it served me right.
fhat's the thanks I get for feeding her.
"I have no fc-ar of the outcome of this
iffair. Mv wife had me arrested last
Phanksgiving day because, as she said. I
â  truck her for not cooKlng a 'turkey din
ler: but she never proved the charge.
lY>'vÂ« had trouble ever since. Several
ninths ago she filed a homestead on my
iroperty which I owned before I married
ler thirteen years ago."
Rockhill is employed as a heater In the
Fudson Iron Works. He is 49 years of
ige. and the woman whom he c*aims at
*mpted twice to-day to assassinate him
f his second wife. By her he has no
â hildr^n. but back at nis old home in
"Mttsburg. Perm., he has five children,
anqing in ages from If! to 28 years.
CLOSE SHAVE FOR McHUGH
Overcome by Gas, He Is Revived Aft

OAKLAND, Auk. 20.â William McHugh,
formerly manager of the People's Express

carbonic acid' gas asphyxiation to-night
at his home, corner of Ninth avenue and
East Sixteenth street. He was found by
his wife lying; unconscious on the' floor

Dr. W. J. Wllcox was promptly sum

to pronounce him fairly out of danger
It was reported that McHugh had at
tempted suicide on account of some re
cent financial reverses, and it was known
that he had been in poor health for some
weeks past, but after he had sufficiently
revived to speak to-night he declared
that it was purely accidental. He says he

ROANOKE BRINGS GOLD
FROM CAPE NOME
SEATTLE. Wash.. Aiifc. 20.â The steam- i
er Roanoke arrived to-night from St.
Michael, Alaska, with 350 miners and gold
dust estimated at (150,000. Mont of this
was brought out of the Cape Norn- dis
trict. G. \V. Price of San Francisco has
the largest individual amount, about $60,
--000. The failure of tho Roanoke to bring
a larger amount of gold dust from Daw
son i.s explained by the fact that she
failed to mako connection? with the Yu

The Roanoke brings further particulars l
of the foundering of tho river steamer

which carried United States Government

duplicate the consignment.
With average good luck It will hp pos

"FATHERS OF THE CHURCH."
The Editor of the Catholic World
Magazine Delivers an Eloquent
Sermon at Old St. Mary's.
The Rev. A. P. Doyle delivered an elo
quent address to the congregation of Old
St. Mary's last evening. Father Doyle,
who was born In San Francisco, Is now
In charge of the literary work of the
Paulist Fathers at New York, being the
editor of the Catholic World. lie spoke
last night of the "Future of the Church,"
in part, as follows:
The nineteenth century, with all its mar
velous changes In the political, industrial and
nodal orders, is the John the Baptist among
the centuriesâ the precursor of a spiritual
awakening. While It ma;' be foolish to as
sume the role of a prophet, still one can easily
argue from signs that are to events that will
be. It may be definitely stated that the trend
of all the great movements, as well as the
result of all the wonderful changes of thk
century, will be a more widespread Intellec
tuality, a closer brotherhood, an.l consequently
a deeper spirituality. There Is no stronger pas
sion In the human heart than that of re
ligion. Very few hearts have ever been with
out some movements of it, and by all odds
the largest majority of men have been stirred
to the highest heroism through its prompt-
Ings. The upward and onward struggle of
humanity -for better living, greater freedom
and higher existence will only more and mora
develop the religious sentiment In the heart.
Unless all signs fall we may consequently ex
pect In the early years of the coming cen
tury a wonderful revival of the religious spirit.
The Catholic church Is gaining recruits to
her standards by the thousands, and this not
only among the common people, but among the
brightest and best in the land. Cardinal Gib
bons estimates the yearly Increase of converts
to the Catholic church to be 30,000. The move
ment which took the form of giving missions
to non-Catholics is now bearing the richest
harvests. This movement takes for its motto:
â¢â¢We come not to conquer, but to win." It
says we are right and we can prove It. It
gathers people of all religions and of no re
ligion, and it explains the truth of Catholic
belief to them. All over the country is this
work carried on, particularly by the diocesan
clergy, with the best result*.

Driven Ashore.
ADVENTURE OF THREE BOYS
ADRIFT IN A BOAT FOB NEARLY
THREE HOURS.
Very Few Tickets for the Excursion
to Meet the Sherman Left â Ah
Sam's Bitter Experience
on the Wilder.
The launch Christian Endeavor, owned
by the Golden Gate Association of Chris
tian Endeavorers, is a wreck on the Ala
meda shore and a party of the Endeavor
ers had to reach shore yesterday by wad
ing through half a mile of mud and water. '
For a long time it has been the custom
Of the association to send a band of En
deavorers onc< or twice through the week
and every Sunday to ships in the bay.
Services are held aboard and a number of j
tracts an.l some literature are distributed i
among the sailors. Yesterday the launch j
was sent nut in spite of the northwester I
that was blowing at the rateof twenty-five .
miles an hour on the bay. All went well ;
until midstream was reached, when the â 
machinery broke down. Those aboard |
waved signals of distress and did every- i
thing possible to attract attention, but |
in vain.
For over an hour tho Endeavours drift- j
ed about in their frail launch and then she j
was driven hard and fast on the Alameda ;
mud flats. A submerged rock went
through the boats bottom and she grad- I
ually filled up t'> a level with the tide. .
Then the young men took off their shoes
and stockings, roiled up their trousers and
carried the ladies ashore. Upon returning j
to this Hide they tried to charter the tug ,
Ida \V. but Captain James had chasi 1
all the derelicts he was looking for that j
day and besides his boat drew too much ;
water. Then they went to Joe Kane and j
he went over in the I.risk. but could ii"t
get near the stranded launch on account I
of low water. If she does not go to pieces j
to-night the boat will be towed off to- .
morrow.
Captain Dan James hnd a long chase in |
tig Ida \V yesterdny after three boya j
in a skiff. The youngsters' names are '
McNulty, Manor and Johnson, and they I
live on Townsend street, between Second I
and Third. Yesterday they went aboard
Whitelaw'a wrecking scow Catalina. See
ing noh.idy around they got into the skiff
that wan alongside, and using a piece of |
plank for an oar paddled away. Once away
from the wharves the wind took control
Of the party and the youngsters were in â¢
a bad way when the Ida \v came along.
The tug was towing the schooner Ruby
A. Cousins and had to make Channel,
street In time to catch the Fourth street
bridge. â  Captain James could not stop,
therefore, to pick up the boat, but rushed i
the schooner through the bridge as quick- j
ly as possible and then went in search '
of the boys. By this time they were ha'.f
way across the bay and it took the Ida
W 'half an hour to catch up with them, i
The boys were lying in the bottom of i
the skiff crying when the tug went along- ;
side. They had given themselves up for
lost and were correspondingly relieved |
when they found themselves aboard tne j
tug.
People who want to meet the Sherman
when she comes in with the California
aboard had hotter hurry up and get
their tickets. Every steamer has been j
sold out except the Piedmont. Berkeley
and Pride of tho River, and these boats j
will only accommodate 2400 people, rnder i
no consideration will more than a given |
numbei of tickets be sold, as the commit-;
tec in charge is determined there shall
be no â rowding. There are left, there
fore, 1"" ; tickets for the Berkeley, 1000 i<-r :
the Piedmont and tOO for the Pride of the
River. No more will be issued.
Ah Sam. cook of the chip Spartan, got a

The <-..ok on the Wilder was not a sue- i
LSt trip and Captain Jackson asked
tan to gel him another one. Sam
tried but failed and yesterday went

of his failure. â  He ran across the old
cook as soon as he crossed the gangplank
and the result was a badly battered Sam

THE DREYFUS TRAGEDY
Discussed From the Pulpit by Rev.
William Rader Last Evening.
Rev. William Rader's sermon on the
"Dreyfus Tragedy" was received by the
congregation of the Third Congregational
Church last night with hearty applause.
The able pastor of * that well-known
church did not mince words in his dis
cussion of the persecution now going on
in the French capital. He chose as his
text Matthew, vltil; 2, 3. In part he said:
The Dreyfus tragedy Is n reproduction and
revelation of the baser passions of the human
heart, and at the samp time an expression of
conscience, courage and â  desire for justice.
In conspiracy It in likened to Macbeth, and
the conspiracy depicted by Shakespeare in his
Julius Caesar. Race and religious hatred is
at the bottom of thin affair. It is France
against the Jew. Dreyfus has Riven the world
an example of the former to suffer alone in
prison, rut off from associations. He had for
aids, first, hip conscience. His letters to his
wife Indicate his self respect and Innocence.
Secondly, the support of his wife, who has
proved herself to be to her husband what the
wife of Uurke was to him, and the wife of
Phillips was to the orator of Hoston's mobs.
Thirdly. Zola, a* brave as a lion and as mag
nificent as the thunder rolling across the sky,
defended him to the last, and Is to be thought
of with the Garrisons, the Beechers and the
Lincolns of history. Fourthly, the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of Moses,'
of Elijah and the chosen people of Israel was
his support.
Public pinion in Paris predicts his convic
tion. The court before which he 13 tried Is
a travesty on Justice. It Is a dlKgrace to
France, regardless of the guilt of the soldier-
Jew. Its decision will probably produce a civil
war. Outraged justice breeds mobs.
There is an eternal law of justice not only
in the Sermon on the Mount, but in life. That
law Is the prophecy of the time when It will
be shown that the beam In the eye of the
French army is of more consequence than the
mote in the eye of Dreyfus. ,

The Dead Pugilist.
Hey. W. E. Dugan of Simpson- Memorial
U. P. Church delivered a short sermon
last night on the death of Boxer Fruney.
In part he said:
As the result of a prizefight Wednesday
evening, one of the pugilists Is dead and an
other black spot has been added to the record
of our city. We can scarcely call ou.wlvi"?
an Intelligent and strong-minded peopla when
the brute propensities m. predominate that we
are satisfied with nothing short of human
flesh and blood with which to feed our do
praved appetites. Franey was literally sacri
ficed to feed the bloodthirsty cravings of the
low and. vicious sporting element of San r"r'/i
--clkco; sacrificed because ho fought not for t\,n
but for money offered by the people present
to have him fight to appease the lowest ap
petites of their brute natures. We shudder
with horror at the thoughts of the cannibalism
of the savage islands of the south seas, but
the sports of San Francisco complacently nit
down to feed on the flesh and blood of a prize
fighter. /;/..",

"REBIRTH OF THE SOUL."
Dr. J. A. Anderson Gives an Interest
ing Lecture at the Academy
of Sciences Hall.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson gave a most
interesting lecture on the reincarnation of
the Joul at the hall of Academy of
Sciences last evening. The speaker's
treatment of the subject was masterly.
In part, he said:
Philosophy demands a reason for existence,
and this reincarnation satisfies by showing
that the soul Is evolving by means of repeated
ly returning: to earth into a god-like being, and
one worthy of and fitted for Immortality. This
v\xrld would be but a chaos If the soul came
hJre but once, and the hapoy accident of
death a few minutes after birth assured eter
nal haDDlneps, while for one who struggled
through a lonsr life of honest endeavor eternal
suffering Is dealt out because of some doubtful
ethical failure.
The soul Is a conscious unit and conserves
its own experiences; eternally broadening and
widening its character through repeated re
birth until It at last becomes god-like, and the
necesÂ»ity for reincarnation ceases. It is dif
fering decrees of evolution which make dif
fering grades of character, for the progress of
any soul depends upon its own exertions.
Genius, the Inflni differences In capacity
which we see in men, are but the result of the
exertions of the *r.ul in past lives, and are due
to nÂ»>-t.ier favoritism nor accident.
DELEGATES WILL
FIGHT UNIT RULE
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT OF ONE
ACCORD.
Chairman Dodge's Plan May Give
Rise to Trouble in the
Convention.
The adoption of the unit rule on Satur
day night by the delegates of the Central
Republican League has caused more dis
cussion than any other occurrence in local
politics for some time past. Although the
rule was adopted as the plan of procedure
for the coming convention it was done
only after a hard fight and much hot dis
cussion. There was a strong element in
the caucus in favor of permitting all fac
tions of the party to name the County
Commltteemen in the districts in which
they won out, and it is likely that they
will combine with the Kelly and Crimmins
delegation on that point when they get
together on Wednesday.
Charlie Nagle of the Thirty-sixth led
the fight against Mr. Dodge's resolution
to adopt the unit, and his delegation bolt
ed thr> caucus when it was adopted. Nagle
said yesterday that he was voicing the
opinions of many other delegates in the
hall and that they had not finished the
fight yet. He denied that he was working
in the interests of Kelly and Crimmins.
but said that if tho unit were allowed to
prevail and the bosses were robbed of the
representation they had won the party
would lose just that many votes at the
election. Mr. Dodge, on the other hand.
says the adoption of his resolution was
another signal of victory over the bosses.
and that there is little danger of losing
their voting strength, as they will have
to openly desert the party to do any
harm.
The candidate crop is growing. One of
the most, prominent of recent announce
ments is that of Edward Head, the School
Director, who Is out for the nomination
for Sheriff. Mr. Head wa.s promised the
nomination lant year, but for political
reasons withdrew. Ho is a prominent
Eagle and a Native Son and controls a
pnlid delegation from thp Thirty-seventh.
He is confident that he will be awarded
the place he seeks on the ticket.
Supervisor Bylngton. another Native
Son. will shortly announce hid candidacy
for District Attorney on the Democratic
ticket, and ex-Food Inspector James
Dockery is hard at work In his fight for
Sheriff Martin's chair.

lu-er took his own life. Mystery pur
rounried the entire affair at Brtt from the
fact that the relatives of the deceased
gave out the story that Boer had fallen
down stairs, when they knew ho was suf
fering from the effects of asphyxiation.

Turned in False Fire Alarm.
A false alarm of firp was turned in from
box 96, at the corner of Ellis and Taylor
streets, about 11 o'clock last night. A
similar alarm was sent in from the same
box about six weeks ago. Both evidently
came from some of the auxiliary boxes,
and the officers are working to discover
the perpetrators of the contemptible busi
ness.

AGRARIAN ISM
IN GERMANY
Movement Is Gaining in
Strength.
OPINIONS OF AN EXPERT
INTEBVIEW WITH ATTACHE OF
GERMAN EMBASSY.
Speaks Concerning the Status of the
Meat Inspection Bill and the
Exports of Sugar to This
Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 20.â Baron vnn
Herman, agricultural expert of the Ger
man Embassy, is back from a visit to
Germany, where he observed the progress
of the meat inspection bill in the Reich
stag and noted the development of the
Agrarian movement which is having such
a marked influence on German affairs, in
cluding the question" of exporting German
beet sugar to the United States. When
asked as to the status of the meat inspec
tion bill he said:
"The bill was brought before the
Reichstag last spring, but a strong oppo
sition developed among Agrarian mem
bers on the ground that the Government
measures were too friendly to the United
I States. About that time a provision was
i placed in the agricultural appropriation
bill passed in this country, giving the
Secretary of Agriculture authority to ex
clude such imports as he considered mi
i jurious to health. This provision was
directed against certain German products,
such as toys which, it was said, might
!be injurious to hen lth because of the
| paint on them. At all events this pro
! vision caused a bad feeling in Germany
I and madtj it more difficult fur the Gov
i eminent to secure the passage of the meat
i inspection bill. It was referred by the
| Reichstag to a committee which had full
power to determine which course was to
Ibe adopted. The committee reported ad
versely and that was equivalent to a re
fusal by the Reichstag to take any action.
ilt may be brought forward again, a?
there really ought to be some modification
of the present law. But It is too early
to say what the future plans will be as
| the Reichttagr is adjourned until Novem
i ber, and everything is at a standstill
; through the summer. It is probable, how
| over, that the Government will consult
with the leaders, and see if some under
standing can be reached on the measure."
Concerning the Agrarian movement,
! Baron yon Herman said: "It is very
! strong, and is turning Its attention to the
'â  interests of the agricultural classes of
I Germany. Tlu- sugar question is essen
: tially an Agrarian one. Our sugar inter
ests are seriously injured by the tax and
countervailing duties 1n the American
tariff law and the Agrarians hold that
'. this not only prejudices their industry.
but that it is a discrimination against
them. They feel U most because it
touches their point and as the results of
their labor, but. above tnis is the consid
eration that the system is not right, being
! a discrimination. They contend that the
question should be dealt with on broad]
j grounds. In the final analysis it comes i
down )" this pimple question:
"Shall there be a development of the
cane industry of uncivilized, semi-bar
barous countries, or shall there be a con
: tinuation of sugar products of civilized
i countries, which are able to buy things
I in return? As the United States does not
product- the sugar actually required by
consumers, a supply must come from out
side sources. Now, it is to the inter
est of this country to buy of the German
producers, rather than turn to the cane
Industry of Java, for example, when Java
, can give little or no return for the pur
chase made of her."
"Moreover, it should be understood."
! added Baron yon Herman, "that the Ger
! man Government derives $30,000,000 out of
the taxes on the sugar industries of the
country, while it pays back as export !
bounties only about 98,000,000, so as a mat- I
ter of fact the bounty comes out of the i
pocket of the sugar producer, instead of !
the treasury, as it is a part of the tax â 
which the producer has paid on his in- j
1 dustry. It is somewhat in line with the i
American revenue tax on mixed flour, !
: which is refunded to the producer in case i
the flour is exported."
On the whole Baron yon Herman seems â 
to think that these pending questions can
be solved to the satisfaction of both sides,
and that a public understanding of the j
legislation Involved will solve half the !
difficulty. Both nations, in his judgment, j
are too far advanced not to see that their
interests lie in the development of their
already existing trade, and not, as he
Bays, "building up a Chinese wall against
the outside world."
U. C. CREW -TO ROW
AGAINST BRITISHERS
Great Interest Developed in the In
ternational Race toâ laj^e
Place at Astoria.
ASTORIA, Augr. 20.â Devotees of rowing,
of whom about 10,000 arc now in Astoria,
I are greatly worked up to-night over the
big Internationa] race which takes place
to-morrow morning. In this contest are
I entered the Alameda and University of
California crews, representing the Ameri
can Side of the race, while the English
i representation consists of a crew picked :
fmm the finest oarsmen of Vancouver j
â  and Victoria, B. C. No other event ever !
! held on the Pacific Coast baa attracted so !
i much attention, and there has been so j
1 much said of it that interest \6 almost en
tirely centered on the race.
The British Columbians had their shell
oui tor an hour this morning for the first
I time. The river was not smooth, but the
! Northerners went over the course several
! times, and expressed themselves as being
â  well satisfied with It. The Californlans
also were out, but returned after a short
i Hpin. Each of the three crews has a
i large number of admirers, and the colors
worn yesterday in honor of the athletes
! have been supplanted by the colors of
I the several crews. Much betting has been
done on the race, which fs thought by
many to lie between the Alamedans and |
the Britishers. Fine weather is probable j
and a new record will doubtless be estab- j
lished. Bach crew realizes that it has ;
the race of a lifetime on its hands and ;
; each Is determined to come out victorious, j
j The launches bearing Governor Geer, his \
j staff, Commodore Edwards, Admiral Day
and other dignitaries, arrived this after- i
1 noon. They were met upon their arrival :
i by a marine procession from this city
and the entire contingent steamed up to I
the city with banners flying and bands |
playing. The Governor and his party
were accorded a hearty reception.
The exercises will open to-morrow with i
the crowning of the Queen. The ceremony j
I will take place at the grand stand, where
i the throne has been erected and will be â 
j participated in by Governor Geer, Mayor
! Bergman and other prominent men of the
j State. To-morrow night the Pacific Coast
I Association of Amateur Oarsmen will be
organized at the Chamber of Commerce.
All the coast clubs, which are now repre- j
sented here, will join in tho organization,
I the future of which is bright. Officers |
will be elected and a constitution adopted. '
To-day an Immense crowd went to the i
' seaside, where a Sunday programme was !
: carried out. The main attraction was the
! life-saving exhibition given by Dr. Fred
j crick Rieul of San Francisco. The doctor
I himself went out into the breakers and
1 gave a demonstratoon of the efficiency of
his apparatus, and later sent out two men.
j While they were returning the kite drop- ;
ptd into the water, and for a time there i
was much excitement, many fearing the;
men would drown. They finally reached !
shore, after a hard swim against the ebb- :
ing tide.
Tennis Cracks Coming.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Aug. 20.â A1l ar-
rangements have been made by George
Wright of Boston to take an all-Eastern
team through the Pacific Coast next
week to play in an intersectional lawn
tennis tournament. The players selected
for the trip are the national champion,
Malcolm D. Whitman, Holcombe Ward
and Dwigtit F. Davis, the great Harvard
team, and the interscholastlc champion,
Beals C. Wright, also of Harvard. This
quartet, who are easily the representa
tive players of the East, will play in a
series of round-robin tournaments. They
will meet the best men on the courts of I
the coast.

FEMALE POISONER
BECOMES INSANE
OMAHA, Aug. 30.â A special to the BeÂ«
from Hastings. Neb., says: Word comes
to Hastings that Miss Viola Horlocker,
who is resting under a $5000 bond charged
with having atempu-d to take the life of
Mrs. Charles F. Morey by sending her a
box of poisoned candy on April 10 last, is
now in an insane asylum at Jacksonville,
111. About two months ago Bilsa Horlock
er went to New York City to visit her sis
ter and recuperate, but it was generally
thought at that time she would not re
turn to Hastings to attend the continua
ii>>n of hf-r hearing, which was to come up
during the equity term of the District
Court. September 25. after which she was
to have been bound over to the jury term
of the District Court in December. It is
the general feeling here that Miss Hor
lncker will be properly adjudged insane,
and this celebrated case will thus ba
brought to a close.

ANOTHER BUTLER IS
ON HIS WAY HERE
Frederick W. Hayball Wanted
in England for Murder,
He Is a Sailor and Supposed to Be On One
of Half a Dozen Vessels Now Com
ing to San Francisco.
THF, harbor police have another
Butler case en their hands. This
time the murderer is supposed to
i><* on his way here from England
on any one of half a dozen vessels.
In Butler's case the police knew he was
on the Swanhilda and was coming here
from Newcastle, Australia, but In the
present instance they will have to keep
a lookout for every vessel that left Eng
land for this port between May 20 and 31.
Frederick William Hayball, sailor, is
wanted for the murder of his wife by the
chief constable of Bristol, England. Hay
ball and his wife were not a happy couple,
end on a number of occasions the husband
was sent to prison for beating her. Once
Fhe left him and for three years sup
ported herself and child. In the mean-
Time Hayball made two voyages to Aus
tralia, and from there to San Francisco
end then home. On returning after the
second voyage he persuaded his wife to
live with him again.
For a year the couple got along all right,
Hayball making a living as a 'longshore
man. At the <nd of the year he began
beating his wife again, and she had him
arrested and he was sent to Jail. After
serving his sentence Hayball went home
and once more commenced to ill treat his
wife, at the same time telling her if she
had him arrested again h>- would kill her.
This was= in March last, and the following
April Mrs. Hayball had her husband ar
again.
When Hayball got out of jail he went
-ht home and found his wife hard at
work. His little daughter was playing in
the yard, but he took no notice of her as
urried Into the house. The bupi
lion is that Ilis wife heard him coming
and tried to lock herself in the bedroom.
The neighbors paid no attention to her
ms, thinking she was only getting
another beating.
Hayball had takÂ«ni a small hatchet with
him a iieiv.l the house. With it

AUTOGRAPHED
PHOTOGRAPHS
FOR A SONG
WAS it not Zangwill who said that if
writing his name on bits of paper
and scattering them broadcast added
to the sum total of human happiness,' he
for one was ready to do it? Now that was
very thoughtful of him; very generous.
Perhaps the same spirit actuated Miss
Bates when she gave recently a souvenir
photograph matinee. Or was it a coup?
"Was it the result of pressure? Was she
snowed under and was this a gracious
way of plowing herself out of town? The
photograph matinee must be an insti
tution of the future â and what Is more
the autograph must be added. Two pro
fessionals, whose anonymosity I am
bound by a promise to preserve, have,
during a short season in San Fran
cisco, received individually close upon
300 letters asking for autographed
photographs. Scarce one stamp among
he lot. That's an item quite forgot.
Some .folks fancy, don't you know, stamps
and photographs just "grow. "You are
adorable; your acting Is perfect; your
voice is liquid silver and the picture you
sond shall pre-empt and ever hold a con
spicuous place on my dressing table â is
the overhandled theme of the notes.
Sometimes the song reaches the piercing
cadenza of "angelic," "divine!" The pro
fessionals of whom I speak are too well
bred to disclose the authorship, but all
are not so considerate, so one should
ever beware what he puts above a signa
ture.
But what I meant to say Is this. Each
of the 400 askers Is probably equally
worthy the thing he covets. How. then,
shall a selection be made? Sometimes a
little messenger, with the hat and habit
and bearing of the cultured, gone uncon
ventional In a hot sympathetic moment,
gets what he seeks and more, but he is
the exception. These claimant demanders
Intend honestly, but when one considers
the expense, financial, mental and physi
ntely cooked and ate the meal the dead
woman hart been preparing for herself,
and then he went to a saloon near by. A
couple of hours later a neighbor went to
the house and found the body of the
woman.
The (load woman had a presentiment
that she was going to lose her life. She
told a friend she felt as if she were go-
Ing to be killed, and she asked her friend
to come around at noon just to see If she
was all right. The neighbor came around
at noon, only to find that the unfortu
nate woman's presentiment had come
true.
Hayball, when notified of his wife's mur- '
der, "was taking a drink. He swallowed i
the whisky and then said he would take
another and go to the house. Instead of
going to the house he disappeared, and
eluding the Bristol police he got away and .
took ship for San Francisco.
There are eight vessels on their way to j
San Francisco, any one of which may |
have Hayball among the crew. They are
the British ship Duchalburn, now out I
eighty-nine days, which saijed from Lon- ,
don four days after the murder: the Bea- |
con Rock, eighty-eight days out from Lon
don: the British ship Glenbreck, ninety
days from Swansea; the French barks
Salnte Annie. Cambronne and Genevieve
Molinos, all eighty-nine days out from
Swansea, and the British ship Dunsdale, j
eighty-two days, and bark Inversnaid,
eighty-six days, from Cardiff.
The description of the murderer for- |
warded to Chief of Police Lees is as fol- j
lows: "Frederick William Hayball, a sea
man, but has recently worked as a dock j
laborer: about M years of age, 5 feet 9^l
inches high, dark brown hair, brown eyes, !
fresh complexion, stout build. Marks, an- j
chor and two blue dots on left forearm. j
Dressed when last seen in a dark coat 1
with a patch on one shoulder, moleskin i
trousers, supposed white muffler with blue ,
spots and cloth cap. Please cause every i
possible Inquiry to be made, and If found [
arrest and wire the chief constable, Bris
tol."
The fleet, on any one of which Hayball I
cal. necessary to satisfy them, the gap
between intention and action looks 100
wide (i â  n to sprawl over. It is a case
of forgetting to multiply yourself by all
others of like mind.
The professional life ip a hard one. Ap
plause is their due. It is meat and drink
fi m:iny. But such food, too highly sea-
Boned and offered as a bribe, is very in
digestible. The professional needs rest.
When the part is played he would lay
it quietly aside and take hold of some
thing else, and that something âbe it
knownâ is not a bundle of letters wherein
the whole .world begs at the top of its
voice, for the pittance of a set of features
on a card, the same made valuable by a
name sometimes Rraciously written by
the feature's private secretary. How Im
personal and absurd It all seems.

yesterday morning. The dedication took
place in the chapel of the edifice at 8
o'clock, and a congregation made up
largely of the solicitors of St. Joseph's
Union assembled to assist the mass,
which was celebrated by the Archbishop.

the inscriptions and records telling 01 laivr
troubles which took place 3000 years ago in
Egypt might be used with but slight altera
tions to describe the strikes among the Penn
sylvania coal miners, or that of the masons

Before Moses led the Hebrews away from the
brickyards of Egypt, before the building of
Rome, and when Greece ; was in its infancy,
the land of the Nile had strikes and riots
among its worklngmen.
Do I believe in trades unions? Oh, yes.
Trades men have as much right to unite as
merchant men, or medical men or clergymen.
The various trades have as muchâ yes moreâ
right to form and organize themselves into
unions for self-protection, self-help and mutual
benefit than the great corporations have to
unite in pools and trusts.
Every laboring man has the inherent right
to his own labor, to dispose of it where and
â when he pleases, and at what may appear to
him the best advantageâ but he has no right,
neither as an individual, a union nor a con
federation of unions to mob or murder another
man for exercising this same right.
AT THE PARK AND CLIFF.
Big Crowds Enjoy the Day at the
Pleasure Places.
Although the crowds at the park and
beach were large yesterday, the absence
of accidents or special incidents placed
the day on the list of quiet ones. The
music was pood, the drive crowded and
soldiers were everywhere in evidence,
and were objects of comment and inter
est.
The crowd at the Chutes was also made
up of thousands of pleasure seekers.
One of the Seymour acrobats Injured his
wrist, and in consequence the Banzards
were tailed upon to take the stage. They
made a big hit with their new Hying act:
Next week Adgie with her lions will
agnin thrill the audience with her daring.
Seats for the reception fund benefit are
being rapidly sold, and it is safe to say
that the house will be crowded to the
doors on Tuesday night when the play
opens.
One of the largest crowds of the season
visited the Cliff House. Sutro baths was
the chief attraction of the day. The fol

DOYLE MAY BE
IN HIDING IN
MARIN COUNTY
Detectives' Mysteri
ous Movements.
DECOY WORK IS SUSPECTED
LEES ENTERS A DENIAL TO CER
TAIN STORIES.
Chief of Police Declares Judge Frick's
Statement Regarding Detective
Cody to Be a Rehash of Un
substantiated Charges.
Chief Lees may believe that Charles
Doyle, alias Howard, alias "Plunger" Hill,
wanted for defrauding Willard Reed
Green of Denver, is on his way to Victo
ria, with the Orient as his ultimate desti
nation, but the movements of his detect
ives are in direct contradiction to such a
theory. For two days detectives have been
quietly at work around San Rafael, and
yesterday two of them were seen and
recognized in Sausalito, facts leading to
the opinion that the wily Chief really
thinks Doyle is in hiding in Marin County
and wishes to entrap his man by having
tales published that he Is probably safe
out of the country. This is an old dodge,
and has oft times proved successful.
Last Friday two men appeared in San
Rafael and interviewed several persons
as regards the whereabouts of a man
whose name they did not give but whose
description iits that of the "plunger."
Whether they were detectives or not no
body seems to know, but they put in a
good deal of their time on Friday and Sat
tirday around the broad gauge depot,
near the stables of the Kelly brothers,
and on Saturday evening took, a late train
for this city.
Yesterday Detectives Graham and Fitz
gerald went to Sausalito and stayed there
the greater part of the forenoon. About
noon they hired a team and went into
the country, in company with Harry Gor
man, an employe of Harvey, the poolroom
operator. On their return to Sausalito
they both told Constable Richard Garrity
they were merely on a pleasure excursion
and were not trying to find Doyle or any
body else.
Chief I^eoÃ is more amused than an
noyed over the statements that he be
friended Howard. Yesterday he cate
gorically denied the reports from Oak
land of his interest in the prosecution of
Fred Foster, the horseman arrested by
Howard for obtaining money by false pre
tenses from him in connection with tne
purchase of the race horses Yellow Tail
and Sam McKeever.
"I only spoke to Howard twice in my
lite " said the Chief yesterday. "The first
time was when he called upon me as to
swearing out a warrant for Foster's ar
rest. He was not with me more than a
minute or two. 1 rang the bell and asked
Sergeant Colby to send one of the de
tectives in, and Tom Gibson came. I told
Gibson to take Howard to one of the
prosecuting attorneys and get him to
swear to the warrant.
"The second occasion was when Judge
Baker came to me and told me Howard
had sworn to ...e warrant under a false
name, as his real name was Hill. I went
outside and Howard was in the corridor.
I told him what Judge Baker had said,
and he replied that It was all right; that
he took the name of Hill on the race
track, as he did not want his family to
"To Father Crowley," said the Arch
bishop, "we owe this beautiful building,
so ornate and well fitted for the use of
which it was destined. To him and to the
solicitors who have made possible the
opening of this magnificent institution for
destitute boys I desire to extend my con
gratulations.
"This is a noble work in which you are
engaged, and we should be grateful to
God that he permits us to co-operate with
him In brirging souls to salvation. There
is no work greater than that of looking
after little children. The Lord himself
singles them out as special subjects ior
our regard and love. The hope and future
of the world lie in the little ones. As
children are, so will the state and the
church be. Unfortunately, thousands of
boys and girls are neglected, and the
problem that confronts us is, w^at are
we to do with those who are liable to be
come dangerous factors in society and
useless members of the church.
"it is to make good citizens and Chris
tians of these neglected little ones that
the Youths' Directory has been formed, so
that they may make their way in the
World decently, honestly and religiously.
The State has no right to pumsn people,
tf we neglect them in the beginning, 'ihe
State does little for this most important
work. It provides jails for the criminal^
and should provide generously for insti
tutions of this character.
"Let us work zealously to free thin
building from debt. The grand bazaar
which is soon to be held should net at
least $30,000 or $40.imki for every cent of it
will be needed. Lot us put our hearts in
the work of forming- the youth of our land
into poor! men and women. With these
few words I intrust this work tn our
blessed Master and :isk St. Joseph to pro
tect all who labor for it."
At the dose of the servi'-es Fa-her
Crowley showed the Ki'ests throughoii"
iho lino edifice and explained that i; has
cost $125,000, and that there was still a
dÂ« ht of $30,000 to ho paid.
Amonp those who were present were
Rev. Father Frieden, superior of the
Jesuit Order, and Rev. Pius Murphy, su
perior of the Dominicans.
I know that lie was a plunger. The ex
planation seemei] satisfactory.
"I deny absolutely thai i ever saw
Howard in the Palace Hotel or anywhere
else, except on the two occasions I have
mentioned. I also deny that I had any
; thing to do with Attorney Dunne petting
; Into the cast- of Howard against Foster.
! I admit that lie is a warm personal friend
i of mine, but how he got into the Howard
case is not within my knowledge.
"Judge Frick's statenÂ«ent as to Detec
tive Cody is merely a rehash of the
: charges tic made last April and did not
attempt to substantiate. I have Detective
j Cody's statement in reply to the published
charges at that time, and it was shown
that Frick attempted to entrap Cody into
making a proposition to him. so he could
use him as a witness for his client. Fop
ter. If Judge Frick had made charges
against Cody, the Police Commissioners,
as he well knows, would have thoroughly
investigated them."
Regarding the rumor that Howard was
in his Pine-street house Monday and
Tuesday last, the Chief said it was too
absurd" to merit attention. Attorney
Sweeney was at the house on these days,
superintending the packing of Howard's
effects, and the letter-carrier had evi
dently mistaken him for Howard.
