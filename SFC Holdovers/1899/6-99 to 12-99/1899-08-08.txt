HARDSHIPS OF
GOLD-HUNTERS ON
ARCTIC SHORES
Prospectors on the Porcupine
River Found After Thrilling
Adventures.
Second Party Led by Scott Mason of Chi
cago Depart After Being Rescued.
It Is Feared All Have Perished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. Ci Aug. 7.â According to arrivals by the
steamer Rosalia. John F. Robertson and a party of eleven
prospectors, who set out from Dawson City a year ago to
prospect along the Porcupine River, returned to the Klon
dike in an emaciated condition on July 22. At Dawson they
told a story of suffering and hardship, a story of narrow escapes
from death time and again in their fruitless search for gold.
They reached Dawson on the steamer Sault Ste. Marie,
which vessel picked them up at the confluence of the Porcupine
and Yukon. The unfortunate prospectors left Dawson because
of a report of a lone miner- who came in from the headwaters
of the Porcupine and told of rich finds there. The Robertson
party, led by the miner, started for the scene of his reported
finds, but during their journey the miner was drowned, and al
though they searched the country thoroughly Robertson and his
party failed to find a trace of the dead man's El Dorado.
Failing to find the golden creeks, they worked their way
across the mountains to the Arctic, intending to prospect en
route, but they found no prospects that induced them to stop.
Colors were found in places, but no pay dirt.
After a trying journey the wandering argonauts at length
reached the Arctic, and were camped on the ocean's shores
near Herschell Island with their provisions all but exhausted
when they were found by a whaler's longboat and by its occu
pants taken to their ship, the only vessel then at anchor at the
Arctic whaling depot. . ..*.._ ,; .. .. ,â.. ; *.~-,. Â .. 'Â£&Â£* -- -.
The Scott Mason ''party* of Chicago had been found on the
Arctic shores by the whalers a short time before the Robert
son party were picked up, and. after being housed and fed for
a month, they had left, intending to make a short prospecting
tour and return. They had not returned, however, and it was
feared they have perished.
The Robertson party spent the winter on the whaler and
then started on the journey back to Dawson. The reminis
cences of their trip are replete with hairbreadth escapes. On
one occasion the raft on which they were drifting down the
Porcupine was swamped, and they had to scramble ashore
leaving their food in the river bed. They managed to subsist,
however, on the game of the northern country, for Robertson
says enormous numbers of cariboo are to be found there.
They were in a very weak condition from the effects of
their journey when the Yukon was reached.

RENNES, Aug. 7.â At 6:30 a. m. this
pretty city of Rennes, neatly
decked with monuments and be
flowered, awakes with incredible
indifference to the great drama
i about- to open, but on every side there
! is animation â gayety even, so pure and
| brilliant is the summer morning. We
; look for places that have been assigned
Ito each of us. There is nothing pomp-
I ous about this salles dcs fetes save its
, name. It is adorned with modest mo
! dillions. exactly like the theater of a
I casino or club in watering places of
recent creation. Chairs have been
, placed in the center for witnesses and a
few specially invited persons, and
; school benches and desks alongside the
walls for journalists.
Some little time is required for every
body to get properly seated, but every
thing is done with urbanity, almost
with cordiality. Evidently for to-day
partisans have railed a truce. The feel
; ing of being out on a holiday agitates
l these Parisians and these Parisienues
i who have escaped from the stifling heat
'of Paris. A breeze delicately perfumed

in through the wide-open windows.
Half an hour has passed while we are
getting installed.
Almost immediately after the stroke
j of 7 the members of the court-martial
and barristers make their entrance. The
! physiognomies of the advocates are
i well knownâ Laborie, of sturdy build,
with his energetic face framed with a
placid, pointed beard; Demange, with
': frame and face of a peasant from the
! plains of Beauce, high-colored and sly.
' The faces with the most strongly
â¢ marked character are those of the col
onel presiding and the Government
commissary. Carrierre. The colonel has
a rather high and mighty air, made
more pronounced by an enormous pair
of entirely white mustaches and by a
heavy white imperial. From a distance
his eyes and white hair are the only
I distinguishable features of his face, but
1 the eye is soft and kindly, in contradic
i tion with the assumed unkindness of
bristling mustache and dryness and
1 volubility of his speech. As for Major
Carrierre, he is a stooping figure, a
wearied man. His face is deeply fur- j
j rowed and fatigued, his voice thin, his
i elocution stumbling. He apepars to be
much more hostile to the prisoner than
j Colonel Jouaust, despite the latter's
I crabbed manner.
"Bring in the accused!"
One of those indescribable, unspeak-
I able moments of which chroniclers rid
I themselves by writing "sensation" or
| "emotion." â *
Ah, yes! .-.;. An 'emotion, sudden and
violent, which seems to , make the
i whole audience rise to its feet, a sensa
tion of curiosity, of pity in the high
est degree, mingled with a vague anx
iety, with heartfelt anguish in the case
of those most passionately thirsting for
justice. yy. tftf
It has been so often stated that this
man Dreyfus has a thankless phy
sique, displeasing voice, an awkward
manner. How will he make his ap
pearance?
Behold him at the foot of a sort of
pulpit, in which his advocates. De
mange and Laborie, are installed with
their secretaries. He is wearing an
artillery captain's uniform, newly
made, his kepi in his white-gloved
hand. He sits down and henceforward
makes never a move. I can see his pro
file clearly as it stands out against the
side wall, of the stage. This profile,
strictly speaking, has no striking fea
ture. Dreyfus is slightly ' bald. The
coronal of hair which still remains
above his temples and back of his head
is "Mite gray, almost white. His mus
tache has lost less of its color. 'The
eyes are deep sunken in their sockets.
His complexion is fresh colored. In a
word, he still very much resembles the
youthful. photograph of. him which we
see in the windows of .Paris paper
shops and which was taken shortly
after he left the Eeole Polytechnique.
The hard life of the Isle dv Diable
which prematurely bleached his hair
has prevented" the lines from filling out
and preserved the firmness, delicacy
and lightness of- youth.
It is toward the end of the sitting that
the audience has its greatest sensation,
during the course of the prisoner's
cross-examinationâ close, sharp and a

little nervous on the part of Colonel
Jouaust and extremely clear and calm
in so far as the prisoner's replies are
concerned.
First of all the bordereau is placed
before Dreyfus* eyes. We ourselves
catch a glimpse from afar of this docu
ment, famous henceforward through all
time.
And at this moment Dreyfus, despite
â  his determination to be firm, again be
i trays emotion and his voice is at once
j warm and thick as he replies: "No,
! Monsieur Colonel. I did not write that.
! I am innocent. Monsieur Colonel, I am
innocent. I have been five years in a
dungeon and I am innocent!"

PARIS, Aug. 7. An evening paper here to-day caused a sensation
by including among the supplementally witnesses whom Colonel Jouaust *<
announces he is to personally summon the name of De Muller, offi- (
cially described as a merchant of Lille, but whom the paper character- ,
izes as a witness from Potsdam, asserting that he will testify concern- :>

It' is also said that -there is a witness named Wilton, a merchant of ,

HARSHNESS TO DISARM
ENEMIES OF DREYFUS
RENNES. Aug. 7.â Mme. Dreyfus visited her husband this after
noon and found him hopeful, although much unnerved, as the rigorous
examination, and especially the unfeeling demeanor displayed toward
him by Colonel Jouaust, proved a tremendous strain upon him.
There are many persons who were present at the trial now under the
impression that the harshness of the presiding judge was assumed and
was intended to disarm the enemies of Dreyfus, who are exceedingly
anxious to interpret ordinary courtesy into the grossest partiality
toward the prisoner. If this be the case, and such an explanation is
quite plausible, Dreyfus is naturally unaware of it, and the effect upon
his highly strung nerves must be very severe.
I the Jews!" or anything like that. Th?
' Paris journalists who had come to re
j port the trial seemed calmed by the
I quietude of this dead city.
It was expected that the Dreyfus
| ites and anti-Dreyfusites would shun
i each other and put up at different
i hotels, but they have tacitly agreed to
I sink their differences in each others
| company. They not only lodge at the
same hotels, but they take their meals
at the same tables and amicably pass
'to each other the dishes. Rennes does
not want them to be theatrical, and so
i they do not pose as ferocious patriots,
: but are glad to drop the characters as
sumed for the drama-loving public of
Paris. tf'tftf '' : ''\ytf
No idea exists in Rennes that the
eyes of the world are upon her, yet
there must be within her walls 300
I men, representing journalism all the
i world over. It never before occurred to
' me what a far-reaching institution the
, press isâ or, at least, I never realized
it so peculiarly.
We were all up at 5 this morning, and
after a hurried meal we rushed to the
! concert-room of the Lycee, where
I the trial takes place. The Ly
! ccc is opposite the military prison,
i and, with the parish church, forms a
j block surrounded by four streets.
Military preparations were going for
i ward to prevent a lot of roughs com
| ing from Paris to act riotously. Drey
fus was to cross the street from the
', prison to the courtroom, but nobody
j was to see him except the military,
! which barred the street to the right
and left of the Lycee door. An offi
cer whispered to me, when I was in the
| Lycee, to go to the window, which he
j indicated, and get a glimpse of Drey
fus. The prisoner was to cross the
i street at ten minutes past 6 and to
j wait in a private room for the sum
| mons to . appear before his Judges.

that accompanies auburn hair. The
lips are rather thin and the chin is that
of a strong man. Indeed, the chin
contradicts the expression of the
eyes.

close to me and entered a room, the

who were taken to the rector's room-
Generals Billot, Mercier, Chanoine,

The widow of Colonel Henry leaned
upon the arm of Captain Wunos. She
was most amiably saluted by Generals
de Boisdeffre and Mercier. She looks
stagy and not ladylike. General Pel
lieux kept , aloof. M. Cavaignac's
cheerfulness seemed forced, but former
President Casimir-Perier was blithe
as a boy. He wore' a summer suit of
shepherd's plaid, a white waistcoat and
a straw hat.
Lieutenant Colonel Picquart was in
plain clothes and was cold-shouldered
by the army people. But apparently
ne did not mind. He had played the
winning card and could afford to be
indifferent. .;*.*'' V .'~ T .--}.-

held, has a vaulted roof. The walls are

At 7 o'clock the coming of the court
was announced in military fashion,
the soldiers presenting arms. The
judges entered from the wings and
were in full dress uniform. They pro
ceeded in Indian file to their places be
hind a long table on a slightly raised
patform. Colonel Jouaust, the presid
ing officer, is a man of dignified ap
pearance, not unintellectual, and has
an upright, martial air. The counsel
for the defense have seats and desks
on the stag- or platform to the left of

cused is in front and also on the stage.
Facing it on the right side are desks

ished all. The figure remains clean
Duilt. He entered with measured step.
His mode of saluting the court was
jerky and very composed, but his fin
gers betrayed nervousness.. His voice
is not good, but it was out of practice
for five years.
The first incident was the declaration
of the President Colonel that he had
unlimited power to call witnesses. He
then ordered those of M. Quesnay de
Beaurepaire to be cited. The indict
ment is that of 1894.
Dreyfus answered cautiously all
questions. The Judge was fair but
evidently not friendly. He showed
himself, however, sensible and sober
minded and impressed every one fa
vorably.
The accused is unfortunate in not
being able, apart from his sufferings,
as told by others, to command sym
pathy. His countenance only expressed
a wish to hide his feelings. It is a
reticent face, but not a bad one. One
would like it to be more frank- The
voice is not pleasing, and the diction is
less so.
Dreyfus seems without dramatic feel
ing and lacks ease in all things. How
ever, he passed to-day through a cruel
ordeal. It was trying, after the ex
perience of the last five years, to find
himself in the full blaze of publicity
and stared at and scrutinized by 700
observers.
In the course of a conversation with
Maitre Demange he remarked that
Dreyfus seemed to be unresponsive and
uncapable of emitting a flow of feeling.
"Think," he said, "what I. or you would
be if for five years out of humanity a
reach constantly under the eye of a
surly jailer, and not only under his eye,
but within the aim of his revolver. He
was bound to silence unless when given
leave to speak. He was beset with ene
mies, was treated as the vilest of mor
tals, was put in irons, though docile and
submissive. He almost learned to cow
er. He found he was losing the lingual
faculties and had to speak to himself
to keep jtup.lknew hitnj)gfcre he was
sent to Devils Island. He" was then
hearty, responsive and really good
company with those he His voice
was singularly tuneful and expressive,
but he lost it.
â¢'Dreyfus is now the ghost of his
former self. All spirit was broken by
the tyrannical treatment, the vapor
bath, the noxious insects and the isola
tion from all intelligent human beings.
He is still proud, but he is cowed. That
hollow voice is such evidence to me of
long and indescribable suffering. It is
a far-off voice, like what one hears in a
telephone. His lachrymal glands are
worn out. In short, he is a wreck.
"I wish his pride would suffer him to
collapse. If it did he would draw tears
from the most stony-hearted. He seem
ed to me miraculous as he bore himself
through all thqse long hours, the, center
to which all eyes converged.: Dreyfus,
I repeat, was a a charming man five
years ago. He was thought fascinating
by the other sex. Only; a lovable man
could have been loved as he has been
by his wife." EMILY CRAWFORD.

DECLARES DREYFUS
Rigid Examination of the
Famous Prisoner by
Colonel Jouaust.
RENNES, Aug. 7.â lnteresting scenes
attended the opening of the second
court-martial of Dreyfus this morning.
At 7 o'clock MM. Laborie and De
mange and Major Carriere, with as
sistants, took their seats and the wit
nesses followed.
MM. Laborie and Demange were
greeted with warm handshakes from
numerous friends in the courtroom.
Former President Casimir-Perier en
tered shortly before 7. An officer met
him at the door and conducted him
to the velvet-covered chairs reserved
for witnesses. The ex-President found
himself between Generals Billot and
Chanoin, both in parade uniform.
Other ex-Ministers of War, Generals
Mercier and Zurlinden and Cavaignac
were seated behind. Colonel Picquart
took a seat without any demonstration
for or against him. '..--.> '-':'"
The officer commanding the row ot
soldiers at the back of the court gave
the command "Carry arms!" "Present
arms!" There was a rattle of arms, and
a moment later Colonel Jouaust, fol
lowed by the other members of the
court, walked on the stage from a room
behind and took seats at the table.
Deep silence fell upon the audience,
who up to then had engaged in a buzz
of conversation. .
The members of the court-martial are
as follows: President, Colonel Jouaust,
director in the Engineer Corps; Lieu
tenant Colonel Brongniart. director of
the School of Artillery; Major de Breon
of the Seventh Regiment of Artillery;
Major Pronllet of the Tenth Regiment
of Artillery; Major Merle of the Sev
enth Regiment of Artillery: Captain
Parfait of the Seventh Regiment of Ar
tillery: Captain Beauvais of the Sev
enth Regiment of Artillery.
Colonel Jouaust and his colleagues
wore full parade uniforms, with aigrettes
in the front of the peaked shakos. On
the right hand of Colonel Jouaust sat
Lieutenant Colonel Brongniart, Major de
Breon and Captain Parfait, all of the ar
tillery. On his left hand were Majors
Profillet and Merle and Captain Beauvais,
also of the artillery.
Immediately after Colonel Jouaust was
seated he gave the order to bring in tne
prisoner. All eyes were then turned to
the right of the stage, on which side was
a door leading Into the room in which
Dreyfus was awaiting the summons. Al
most everybody but the most prominent
officers stood on their feet; some mounted
the benches to qbtain a better view.
There were subdued cries of Sit down,
amid which the door opened and Captain
Alfred Dreyfus, preceded and followed by
a gendarme, emerged into the courtroom.
His features were deathly pale and his
teeth were set with a determined but not
defiant bearing. He walked quietly with
almost an elastic step, and ascended the
three steps leading to the platform in
front of the Judges. There he drew him
self up erect, brought his right hand
sharply to the peak of his military cap,2

to the word of command from the lieu
tenant in charge carrying and presenting
arms, the Judges leaving and re-entering
to the rattle of rifles as th.- line of soldiers
brought their weapons, like a piece of
machinery. smartly to the "present and
then dropped their butts heavily to t..e
ground. This performance was repeated
every time the court retired. Dreyfus was
withdrawn into an inner room during the
court's retirements. On the final return
of the court Major Carriere said he
thought the absence of Esterhazy ought
not to prevent the trial proceeding.
"Let him come or not," he said, it
matters nothing to us."
After the court had decided not to ad-
Jqurn on account of the absence of certain
witnesses the clerk of the court was or
dered to read d'Ormeschevllle's bill oi
indictment of 1894, which, he did in a loud
voice. Dreyfus. In the meanwhile; listen
ing unmoved as the old charges against
him were read.
Colonel Jouaust then handed the pris
oner a long slip of cardboard upon which
the bordereau was pasted.
"Do you recognize this document .
Dreyfus replied with a passional out
burst: "No. mv colonel. I am innocent.
1 declare, here, as I declared in 1894. I
am a victimâ"
His voice here was choked with ids,
which must have stirred every specta
tor In the court. The voice of the pris
oner did not seem human. It resem
bled the cry of a wounded animal. He
ended his reply with the words: "Five
years in the galleys! My wife, my chil
dren! Mv God! lam innocent, innocent!
Colonel" Jouaust said. "Then you deny
It?"
Dreyfus replied. "Yes. my colonel.
Colonel Jouaust then read the boidereau
and afterward asked, "In 1890 you word at
Borges?" - - â  â
Dreyfus replied, "Yes. my colon"!.
Jouaust- The 120 brake was then being
made and you were In a position to know
the instruction of the brake?
Dreyfusâ l knew the principle of it.
Jouaustâ Had you any information re
specting Its working?
Dreyfusâ No: I did, not know the details,
never" having worked It.
Jouaustâ Did you have the brake at the
military school?
Drevfus â I don't remember.
Jouaustâ At the beginning of 1891 you
entered the general staff?
Dreyfus--- Yes, my colonel. I
Jouaustâ Have you talked on gun 120 and
its brake?
Dreyfus, who then had regained his
composure, spoke distinctly and in a way
which carried conviction with It. An
swering the last question he said. "No; I
never had any knowledge of this gun
while I was in the bureau of the general
staff."
Jouaustâ The second document of the
bordereau relates to mobilization. Had you
any knowledge thereof?
Dreyfusâ No; I was not in that bureau
dealing with mobilization.
Jouaust â You had to do with transports.
Now. when the regulations concerning the
conveying of troops in 1894 were modified
there were difficulties in insuring the
transportation of troops and provisional
measures were taken which were changed
In the following spring. Did you know
of these dlfficu titles?
Dreyfusâ l had no knowledge of this
question in 1894. I had certain documents
concerning the provisioning and convey
ing of troops.
Jouausl â You had papers in your pos
session intended for print?
Dreyfusâ Yes. I sometimes made a mis
take In the bureau to which they should
be sent.
Jouaust â Ton had these papers twice
Dreyfusâ l did not have any confidential
documents.
Jouaust- You must have known the con
tents of these documents?
Dreyfusâ l never asked for them from
any-one.
Jouaustâ third document relates to
artillery formations. You ought to be ac
quaint, -d with these matters?
Dreyfusâ No. . itf-tf:
Jouaustâ Major Morin-Milon sent . you
special documents from the 15th to the
20th of July, -1894. a month before the date
of the bordereau? -,*â¢ â¢Â«- . > â

Jouaustâ the end of 1594 had you
knowledge, of information sent to Lieuten
ant Bac by the' third bureau on the effect
iveness of the batteries of the 120-gun?
Dreyfusâ No. ......
Jouaust- '(with a movement of impa
tience)â This is astonishing. The bureau
knew what documents pass from one to
the other.
Dreyfusâ What I say Is correct.
Jouaustâ l turn to the fourth document,
a note referring to Madagascar. There
are two papers. A corporal who copied
them saw you pass through his offlce go
ing to the colonel's room.
Dreyfusâ l went through occasionally.
Jouaustâ Y'ou could have obtained this
document from the corporal's desk?
Dreyfusâ This ls not usual.
Jouaust â No. but it could be done. The
copying was flnlsned on the 28th. and the
bordereau dated from several days later,
Not** for the fifth document, the proposed
firing manual for field artillery. Did you
know the contents of the manual?
Dreyfus (emphatically)â Never!
Jouaustâ A witness says you communi
cated It to him.
Dreyfus (vehemently) No, never.
Jouaustâ A major lent this firing manual
to you?
Dreyfusâ No, my colonel. I deny it ab
solutely.
Dreyfus then entered Into an explana
tion of dates, but his memory failed him.
Colonel Jouaust then took up the famous
phrase, "I am starting for the maneu
vers." He said :
"You had never been at the maneuvers
because it was the custom for only pro
bationers to go. But at the date of the
bordereau you did not know you would
not go?"
Dreyfus There had been fresh orders
given.
Major Carriere here intervened, saying:
"But there were two sets of orders given.
It was in September when It was decided
not to send the probationers to the ma
neuvers."
Jouaustâ work were you engaged
on in the fourth and first bureaus?"
Dreyfus enumerated the different tasks,
adding: "I was only occupied with cur
rent matters and perhaps a few studies
of which I forget the subject."
Jouaustâ At the military school you
were reproached with saying the Alsa
tians were happier as Germans than as
Frenchmen?
Dreyfusâ No; I never uttered such
words. tftftftftf
Jouaustâ Plow do you account for tho
r bad note against you written by a certain
| general? .
Dreyfusâ He said he wanted no Jews on
the general staff.
Jouaustâ How do you know what he
j said?
Dreyfusâ conversations.
Jouaust -You attributed this bad note
I to your religion?
! Dreyfusâ Yes.
Jouaustâ ln 1892 you went to Mulhaus.
> What did you do there?
Dreyfus I went there three times by
i way of Basle, without a passport. Once I
â¢; arrived at ray house I never went- out.
; Jouaustâ You went there in 1886?
Dreyfusâ Yes, possibly.
: Jouaustâ Did you follow the German
! maneuvers?
Dreyfus â No.
! Jouaustâ Did you converse with German
! officers?
Dreyfusâ l deny it absolutely.
I Jouaustâ What was your object in going
I to Alsace?
Dreyfus- -For instruction.
Jouaust- You studied transports?
Dreyfusâ Yes.
I Jouaustâ You wrote certain information
! respecting the manufacture of the Robin
' shell. You said this information was re
j quested by a professor of the military
' school. This was false. I am told you
; asked officers indiscreet questions.
! Dreyfusâ lt is not true.
| Jouaustâ Did you go to Brussels in 1894?
Dreyfusâ No.
! Jouaustâ A witness affirms you went.
Dreyfus- It is false.
Jouaustâ You had relations with a
woman?
! 1 âºreyfusâ Yes.
Jouaust- What nationality?
â¢ Dreyfusâ Austrian.
Jouaustâ How could you have such rela
| tions, you an officer of the general staff?
Dreyfusâ committed no indiscretion.
Jouaustâ Your books were well kept.
j You had special resources. Passing
i through the Champs Elysee in ]â '!'] you
j remarked: "Here lives a certain lady.
i Suppose we call on her. I have lost heavy
| sums at her house."
Dreyfusâ lt is false. I have never
i gambled. Never, never!
I Jouaustâ Did you know Colonel dv Paty
l-^eyfus-No.
Dreyfus- No.
i Jouaustâ Did you know Major Henry?
Dreyfusâ
! Jouaustâ You have no motive for ani
: mosity against them? *
Dreyfusâ No.
Jouaust â And Colonel Plcquart?
Dreyfusâ l don't know him.
Jouaustâ Ajid Lieutenant Colonel Ester
hazy?
Dreyfus-"-! don't know him.
Jouaustâ You never wrote him?
Dreyfusâ No.
| Jouaustâ Colonel dv Paty de Clam says
: that your writing at his dictation was less
j nrm when he made you undergo a trial on
j the day of your arrest.
, Dreyfusâ My writing has not 'much
j changed.
Here a non-commissioned officer, who
was standing in front of Major Carrier-,
crossed the platform and handed Dreyfus
his writing on the day of his arrest.
Dreyfus replied by insisting that there
: was nothing to show any perceptible
; change in his handwriting. -- â¢
Colonel Jouaust then spoke of the inter-
I view with Dv Paty de Clam, and Drey
fus replied, "I never confessed anything
to Dv Paty do Clam."
Here occurred one of the most dramatic
: scenes In the proceeding. Dreyfus, tre
mendously excited, swayed to and fro for
a moment, and then all his pent-up emo
tion and Indignation burst forth, and in a
â  piping voice, heard throughout the court
room, and even by those standing on the
' outside, said: "It is iniquitous to con
demn an innocent man. I never confessed
i anythingâ never!"
Dreyfus as he uttered these words
raised his white-gloved right hand and
held it aloft as if appealing to heaven to
' vindicate him.
Colonel Jouaust then said: "At the
| time of your condemnation Colon"] Dv
Paty do Clam went to see you In the
prison. What passed between you?
Dreyfusâ He asked me If I had not given
unimportant information ln order to ob
tain other information. I replied "No,"
and added that It was iniquitous to con
demn an innocent man. I also asked him
to bog the Minister of War to seek full
light to the affair.
Jouaustâ Did you not say to him, refer
ring to a foreign military attache, that
you would cut his throat with a polgnard?
Dreyfusâ No. I asked Dv Paty do Clam
to have the investigation continued. I
said: "Any Government which has means
of investigating can have the foreign mil
itary attaches questioned. If I were in Its
place, rather than have an innocent man
condemned I would force them to speak,
even if I had to hold a dagger to their
throats."
Colonel Jouaust then said: "Coming to
the day of your degradation, what passed
between you and Captain Le Brun Re
nault? What did you tell him?
Dreyfusâ Nothing. It was really a sort
of broken monologue on my part. I felt
that everybody knew of the crime with
which I was charged, and I wished to say
I was not the guilty parte I wished to
make clear that the criminal was not he
whom they had before their eyes, and I
said: "Le Brun, * will cry aloud my inno
cence in the face of the people."
Jouaustâ Did -ou not say: "The Minis
ter knows I handed over documents"?
Dreyfusâ No; ir I sDoke of a Minister
who knew I was Innocent. I referred to a
conversation I had previously had with
Paty de Clam.
- . Jouaustâ Did you say; '.'lf I handed
over documents it was to have more im
portant ones In return"? _ , ;
Dreyfus No,
Earlier in the examination Colonel
Jouaust asked: "Had you relations with
a lady living in the Rue Bizet?"
Dreyfus replied: "I had no Intimate re
lations with her."
Jouaustâ l do not mean from a moral
point of view but from a. military point of
view. This woman was* suspected of spy
ing. Why did you visit her?
Dreyfusâ Lonly learned that at my trial
In ISM. Major Gondrlon introduced me to
her. and as Gondrion belonged to the in
quiry bureau he ought to have known if
j she was suspected.
! Jouaustâ you say "In three years
: they will recognize my Innocence?" Why
j did you say "three years?"
Dreyfusâ l asked for all means of In
' vestigation. They were refused me. I was
i justified that at the end of two or three
] years my innocence would come to light.
Jouaustâ Why three years?
Dreyfusâ Because a certain time Is ne
cessary to obtain light.
Jouaustâ Had you an arrlere penseo
(afterthought)?
Dreyfusâ No.
The examination of the prisoner was
ended with a few minor questions and the
court decided to sit behind -closed doors
by five votes to two.
During the trial Dreyfus' voice was
harsh, nasal and no wise sympathetic. Ho
spoke very low at first and later as he
grew more used to his surroundings he
spoke louder, more confidently and more
distinctly. The prisoner responded with
military precision to the first questions
of the Judge, who opened with an abrupt
order to stand up. Dreyfus thereupon
I stood and Colonel Jouattst continued:
"Your name?" Â.,.*
"Alfred Dreyfus."
"Your age?"
"Thirty-nine years. - -
"Your profession?"
"Captain of artillery."
''Where were you born?"
"Mulhouse."
Colonel Jouaust treated Dreyfus
brusquely, almost brutally, and It was -a
matter of satisfaction to the friends of the
prisoner when the latter set tne Judge
himself right on certain dates connected
with Dreyfus' stay on the general staff.
It was an unimportant point, but it was
; eloquent testimony to the keenness of
Dreyfus' intellect.
The prisoner sat most of the time with
his legs stretched out. his spurs resting
; ! on the ground, his hands Joined and rest
| ing on his lap. He repelled the insinua
tions that he had relations with German
officers during his stay in Alsace in
â  fiercely indignant terms.

DEWEY'S EYE ON MANILA
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO
Requested Permission to Capture the
City at the Time of the
Virginius Affair.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.â An interesting
historical fact dating back to .873 has
come to light in which Admiral Dewey
was the centra', figure. Dewey, then a
commander, was in command of the
United States ship Narragansett on the
Astatic station, having taken charge of
the vessel on March l. 1873. The vessel
was on surveying duty when the Vir
ginlus trouble was precipitated and a" war
with Spain seemed imminent. Commander
Dewey wrote to the Navy Department re
questing that in case war was declared he
be assigned to the duty of capturing Ma
nila. The peaceful settlement of the con
troversy with Spain avoided th.- necessity
for a hostile demonstration, but the in
teresting fact Is that the doughty officer
had his eye on Manila over a quarter of
a century ago. â . * ; 'Â.....
A search twill he made for the letter m
the flies of the Navy Department and if it
is found it is expected an effort will be
made by the citizens' committee to have
it reproduced as a souvenir of the recep
tion to be tendered Admiral Dewey on his
arrival here.
LONDON. -Aug. B.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says Admiral
Dewey will arrive there on Wednesday
and that he has asked for an audience
with the Pope. According to the same
correspondent the admiral will visit Lon
don before returning to the United States.
LABOR POLITICAL PARTY
FORMED IN NEW YORK
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.-- response to a
call issued some time ago by the Central
Federated Union twenty-one delegates,
representing 105 labor organizations, met
to-night in Clarendon Hall to consider the
advisability of forming a permanent la
bor political party. President Samuel
Prince of the Central Federated Union
called the organization to order.
The credential committee declined to ad
mit Edward Friday of the Clothing
Salesmen's Union on the ground that he
is a Tammany politician and an inspector
on the Third Avenue Railway and not a
bona fide salesman. William Marlin, with
credentials from the Knights of Labor
local assembly 1563. was rejected on the
ground that he had been a candidate on
the last Republican ticket- - ".'â ;â¢
Joseph Barondoos of the tailors, leader

PUBLIC AUTOMOBILE
SERVICE IN NEW JERSEY
Syndicate Formed to Run Vehicles
Between Philadelphia and
New York.
TRENTON. Aug. 7.â This city and all
the larger cities of New Jersey will soon
have a public service of automobiles. To
provide this the New Jersey Electric Ve
hicle and Transportation Company has
increased its capital from $100,000 to $1,200,
--000, a certificate to that effect being filed
to-day. This company is backed by the
capital of the Whitney-ETkins syndicate,
of which James E. Hayes, president of
the company and formerly law partner of
the late George M. Robeson. Secretary of
the Navy under General Grant, is the
New Jersey representative. .
Mr. Hayes said to-night that an auto
mobile service would at once be estab
lished in the larger cities and towns of
the State and at the coast resorts.
"We will establish a connecting system
between New York and Philadelphia," he
said, "and expect to make the New Jer
sey company our working model for other
States. We have formed twenty com
panies under the Now Jersey laws and
expect to make this the center of our en
tiro system. On our conveyances in this
State will be put all the modern appli
ances.
"For the present our headquarters in
this State will be Jersey City, although
it is probable we will soon establish
branches at Trenton to have supervision
over the southern end of the State. Al
ready we have 4500 vehicles constructed
and we will begin the operation of our
system at once."

SOLDIERS CHEER THE
CLEVELAND STRIKERS
j CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. More per
i sons rode on the cars of the Big Consoli
! dated Streetcar Company to-day than on
! any day since the boycott was declared.
A new feature of the strike was the act
! of prominent business men in -signing, a
call for a meeting to be held in the Cham
! ber of Commerce building to-morrow
night to organize a law and order league
to fight the boycott. Sympathy for the
strikers has extended to the soldiers who
are' guarding the property of the street
car company, and to-day. when a com
pany of the Fourth Regiment lined up at
the Miles-avenue barns In Newburg. the
soldiers gave three cheers for the strik
ers. These were followed by three lusty
groans for the non-union men.
To-day the local Brotherhood of loco
motive Engineers' lodge sent a Contribu
tion of $mo and a letter to the*, strikers.
In the letter the lodge said the contribu
tion was made because P. M. Arthur.
chief of the brotherhood, had advanced
himself in the favor of the company and
had ridden on the boycotted cars. The
lodge by a unanimous vote censured the
chief.
To-day the newsboys declared a boycott
on the Leader and Plain Dealer, morning
newspapers, because of their favorable
attitude toward the streetcar company.

NEW REGIMENTS
TO BE HURRIED TO
THE PHILIPPINES
Otis Will Be Reinforced for the
Fall Campaign by the First
of November.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.â
In accordance with the new policy inaug
urated by Secretary Root to expedite the
departure of reinforcements for General
Otis. orders were telegraphed to recruit
ing officers to-day by Colonel Thomas
Ward, assistant adjutant general, direct
ing them to complete the enlistment of
men for new volunteer regiments by the
end. of the present week.
Th regiments will then be carefully
drilled. at" their present camps and will,
department officials say, be prepared to
commence the journey to Manila by-
September 1. Quartermaster General
Luddington told me this afternoon that
the transports Sherman and Grant would
be at San Francisco the latter part of the
month, and they will be able to accommo
date two of the regiments. Other ships
will be at San Francisco early in Septem
ber. The Logan and the Thomas, which are
being converted into modern troopships
at New York and Philadelphia, will be
completed as rapidly as possible, and they
undoubtedly will be ready in time to con
vey two of the volunteer regiments to the
Philippines. -..-,'
By the early part of November all the
reinforcements now under orders to join
General Otis will, it is stated, have
reached their destination, and he will
have 46,000 men under his command to
engage in the fall campaign. '*._ ' .
Of the 13,000 men required for the ten
regiments being organized in this country
Colonel Ward told me to-day that 10,3.52
have been enlisted, leaving 275S yet to be
mustered into service. As enlistments
have been made in the past at the rate of
510 per day no doubt is expressed that the
department's orders sent put to-day <Â»-'
reeling that the regiments be h led by toe
end of the week will be complied with
The Twenty-seventh and lhirty-nrst
regiments now have more men than they
were allowed by the President s orders,
but over-enlistments were permitted in
order that they might work out some of
the undesirable men who have undoubt
edly entered the service.
Probably because of the sentiment ex
isting in the South against the war in the
Philippines the War Department has
found that it will be impossible to Ml the
two regiments being organized at Fort
McPherson, Georgia, and Fort Sam
Houston with Southern recruits. The re
cruiting officers at Fort McPherson have
succeeded in enlisting only 635 men, while
those at Sam Houston have obtained but
545 men. Orders will, therefore, be issued
directing that Northern and Western men
be drafted into these regiments until UV'ir
entire complement is obtained. The de
partment has not obtained a more satis
factory reason for the unwillingness of
Southerners to enter the army than the
sentiment which appears to exist against
continuing the struggle to suppress the
rebellion. There is reason to believe that
Major General Miles is in favor of increas- j
ing the cavalry force in the Philippines to
10,000 men, and as the Herald has stated
the department is considering the art visa- ,
bility of sending more cavalry to Manila. |
General Otis has reported that he Is ob- |
taining a number of men for the volun
teer cavalry regiment he is organizing at i
Manila, but the department Is making ar
rangements to ship cavalry recruits along |
STRIFE OVER A PIANO
MAY END IN COURT
SAN* RAFAEL, Aug. 7â The sensation
at Bollnas over the arrest of three prom
inent society persons on the charge of
house-breaking, it being alleged that they
entered the house of William MeGovern
and took therefrom a piano, is rivaled in
local school circles. Miss Jessie Elliott,
the teacher of the San Rafael Kinder
garten, now has a piano which she had
carted away from the rooms of the Moth
ers' Club without the consent of the own
ers, and it is probable that her arrest will
follow.
Four years ago a social and temperance
organization existed in this city known
as "The Y's." The members held enter
tainments and with the money thus ob
tained purchased a good piano. The club
finally disbanded and at Miss Elliott f s
expressed desire placed the instrument in
her hands tor safe keeping. For the use.
of it she agreed to keep It in order, and
promised to surrender it when a majority
of the members so wished. ~ tftf
Three weeks ago the members of the
disbanded club were asked to permit the
Mothers' Club to use the piano at a cer
tain monthly rental, and concluded so to
do. William McKenzie, the secretary of
"The V's," was sent to Miss Elliott for
the piano. She refused at first to sur
render it, but finally became angry and
said that if it was not taken out of her
house by 9 o'clock the next morning she
would take a hatchet and destroy it. An
expressman was sent for the instrument
and removed it to the apartments of the
Mothers* Club in the High School build-
Ing.
Three days afterward Miss Elliott sent
another expressman to the High School
building while the janitor was engaged
in cleaning the halls and had the piano
brought back to her house. Since then
she has refused to relinquish possession
of it. McKenzie threatened her with ar
rest, but she remained obdurate. The
High School opened to-day and the
Mothers' Club has to carry on Its work
without the consoling strains of the
piano.
Secretary McKenzie was suddenly called
to Bolinas and said before he departed
that on his return he intended to have
Miss Elliott placed under arrest. The
Mothers' Club includes in its membership
the wives of some of the most prominent
citizens of the community. Miss Elliott
is the best known of local kindergarten
teachers.
HOSPITAL ATTENDANTS
CHARGED WITH MURDER
NEW YORK, Aug. 7.â An examination
of the body of James McGuire, formerly
a paretic inmate at the Manhattan Hos
pital on Wards Island, and who died in
that institution on Saturday, led to the
arrest to-night of four keepers, Thomas
Sexton. Patrick Ryan, Daniel O'Connell
and Martin White, who may have to
answer to a charge of murder. The ar
rests were made on the strength of the
report of the Coroner's physician who
conducted the post-mortem and reached
the conclusion that McGuire met death
by violence.
Scarcely a spot en the dead man's body
was free from bruises, which apparently
were the result, not of blows from a club
or other instrument, but of pressure from
the knees of the attendants. From his
head to his knees deep blue dents were
discernible on the flesh. Six of the ribs
on the right side were* broken. The In
testines had broken through the abdom
inal membrane, while the membrane itself
had been torn almost to ribbons. The
kidneys and liver had been badly bruised
and although there Was no fracture of
the skull there was a large abrasion at
the back of the head. - . -- .*.-.-
McGuire. before becoming insane, had
been a professional strong man and
wrestler.
PROPOSE TO LICENSE â¢
PUBLIC UTILITIES
HOLLISTER, Aug. 7.â The District At
torney has been instructed to prepare a
license ordinance and in future all tele
phone, telegraph and express companies
will be required to procure licenses to
transact business in San Benito County.
The action of Wells, Fargo & Co. in
requiring patrons to pay the War tax has
aroused the greatest hostility to the com
pany, and a vigorous effort will be made
by town and county to bring It to book.
At the session of the Town ' Trustees
to-night a license ordinance affecting
telephone,, telegraph and express com
panies was passed. The officials here are
in earnest and have ample funds to carry
the case through to the highest courts.

SHIELDS' PRAISE OF
A SLAIN ORDERLY
WASHINGTON, Aug. Major George
F. Shields, surgeon of the Third Brigade
at Manila, has made a report to Surgeon
General Sternberg under date of June 1
of his duties during April and May. In
it he specially commends Private Paul
Gompers of the Hospital Corps, who was
killed in action April 25. â¢ ''< '-":-'â â 'â¢ â >
Major Shields says: "On April 25. dur
ing the advance at the river Bagbag, my
orderly. Private Paul Gompers, was fa
tally wounded while on the armored car,
a Remington bullet passing through his
neck, completely severing the carotid ar
tery and jugular vein on both sides. I
beg here to call the attention of the sur
geon general to the services of this man.
He was constantly with me from Feb
ruary 5 until the day of his death. "We
were' together on the firing line during
the battle and after the battle, and he
performed his duty so bravely, so faith
fully and so unselfishly that he gained
the respect and admiration of the com
manding general and his staff, as well as
all with whom he came in contact. 1
could quote instance after instance of
his bravery, but I feel that the collective
statements*- which I have made will be
evidence enough of the fact that he was
a man of unusual merit."
GUNBOAT NAPIDAN
SHELLS PAETE
MANILA. Aug. 2 (via Hongkong).â The
gunboat Napldan last week shelled Paete
on the lake near Santa Cruz. The town
was full of people who had been en
couraged to return after General Law
ton's expedition, having been assured that
they would not be molested if they peace
ably attended to their business.
Lieutenant Copp, who was in command
of the Napidan, heard that the in
surgents had reoccupied the town and
steaming close in opened fire with his
six-pounders without warning.
The people, seeing the boat approaching,
fled to the hills in a terrified condition and
with barely time to. escape. One child
was killed and many buildings were dam
aged. The authorities express great re
gret on account of the incident.
After the taking of Calamha by the
Americans General Lawton ordered that
Captain Otis of the Washington regiment
be relieved of his command and placed
under arrest on account of slowness and
seeming reluctance of the companies un
der his command in obeying the order to
disembarked from the cascoes and wade
through the marshes under fire. The men
say that a majority of them have been
sick and unfit for duty and were given
to understand that they wouldn't be
asked to do any more fighting.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 7.â The follow
ing dispatch has been received from
Admiral Watson, in command of the
Asiatic station:
Secretary of the Navy, "Washington:
Nazro, the commander of the Manila, on
July 7 .re-established the lighthouse at
("ape Melville, Balabac, Philippine Islands,
and hoisted the nag with appropriate
honors. July 13, on his return, thirteen
Moros. under arms, were found to be in
possession of the lighthouse. Landing
party, commanded by Ensign E. L. Bis
sett. encountered resistance. There were
no casualties In our party. The enemy
lost one officer and one "man. Diegagb
Manilo, chief of the Balabac Moros, was
killed, seven were taken prisoners and
two escaped. The chief of the party was
very unpopular with the people of Bala
bac owing to fear of him. The lighthouse
has been restored. The Charleston Is on
her way to Balabac and will rend all
assistance possible. WATSON.
The Island of Balabac, the scene of
the brush with the Moros, detailed in
Admiral Watson's dispatch, is situated
poutheast of the island of Palawan,
which is the most westerly of the Phil
ippine Islands and directly west of the
island of Pa nay. The light there, which
was re-established by "Lieutenant Com
mander Nazro, shows for twenty-five
miles and is regarded as of consider
able importance to navigation, being
directly in the line between Singapore
and the Straits Settlements and the isl
ands to he north. The island is twen
ty-two miles long and. according to in
formation in the possession of the de
partment, has but a population of 1100.
These are described in Admiral Wat
son's dispatch as Moros, the name ap
plied to the fierce natives of the Sulu
group. They are Mohammedans and
nre regarded as the most warlike peo
ple in the Philippines. The capital.
Balabac, has a population of 200. The
Spp.nish Government established a mil
itary post there in 1857. It consists
of a barracks, a hospital and an armed
fort.
The Manila, the vessel described in
the dispatch, is a captured transport.
Its mission in that vicinity is unknown
at the Navy Department. It is evident
from the dispatch that the Manila has
left a landing force there to guard the
light and that, the Charleston, which
is on its way there, will see that the
landing party receives such reinforce
ments as may be deemed necessary.

Sir Mackenzie characterizes as childish
I the Premier's alleged excuse of hostility
ito Canada on the part of the United

to every man in Canada to know whether
the friendly relations between the I nited

Sir Mackenzie Bowell retortea that

NEW SAMOAN TREATY

WASHINGTON. Aug. 7.â The State De
partment has received a brief dispatch
from San Francisco announcing the ar
rival of the American and German mem

proposed to substitute for the treaty of ,

bassy called at the State Department dur
ing the day and had a long talk with As
sistant' Secretary Cridler, who has spe
cial charge of Samoan affairs. It brought
out no new phases, however, as neither
of them had received anything from the
commissioners save brief announcements
of their landing, It appears that chief
Justice Chambers' visit here may be de- ,
ferred until next month, as he has writ- ,
ten a private letter to one of the officials
In this city saying that he probably j
would put off his visit until September
According to the view taken at the
State Department the action of the com
mission so far as It changes the Berlin
treaty is merely ad referendum and does ;
not become effective until formally ap- ;
proved by the three governments and. In
this country, ratified by the Senate. This.
is likely to bring about extended consid- ;
eVatlon of the work done by the com
mission, though tnere Is no disposition to
question the care with which it has pro- j
ceeded.
CANADA COMPLAINS.
Seizure of Fishing Vessels Leads to
Complications.
PORT TOWNSEND, Aug. 7.â The recent
seizure of several Canadian fishing vessels
by the revenue launch Guard in the vicin
ity of Point Roberts and Blame for fish
ing In American waters has raised some
intricate points In International law. It
is claimed there is no law which prohibits
foreign vessels from fishing in American
waters, and under this claim the British
embassy at Washington made a demand
on the "United States Government for the
immediate release of the vessels. - The
case was referred here for investigation
and the revenue officers say the vessels
were seized for landing nets in American
waters without complying with the cus
toms laws by entering their certificates.
This explanation was not satisfactory,
and advices by wire from the Treasury
Department at Washington say that
United States Consul. Smith at Victor'
has been ordered to proceed to Point Rob
erts and Blame immediately to make a
thorough Investigation and report with
out delay to the department.

inch gashes in the back of her head.
Beside her on the floor lay a bloody
hatchet. The flat was In perfect order
and Mrs. Kronmann's jewelry, valued at
several thousand dollars, had not been
disturbed. There was no evidence of a
struggle. The woman had evidently been
struck down while passing through the
private hallway. Mrs. Kronmann was
removed to the hospital and up to a late
hour had not regained consciousness. Mr.
Kronmann is a wealthy fruit commission
merchant.
Kronmann was permitted to visit Roose- ;
velt Hospital to-night- Afterward he was
i taken to the West Thirty-seventh street
; station and charged with attempting to ,
murder his wife.
The police say they have learned that a i
woman had been much in Kronmann's ,
company of late, and that she called fre- ;
: quently at his place of business. Kron
: mann and the woman, the police say,
i would frequently spend several hours
I in each other's company, and on such
' occasions he always arrived home late.
When his wife demanded explanations he
â  pleaded business engagements.
Kronrrfann was seen to leave his place
of business accompanied by the woman,
j and he admits that he did not reach his
home until 7 o'clock. When examined at
the police station his coat sleeves and ;
cuffs were found to be stained with
blood, but he says he received the stains
! while lifting his wife out of the hallway.

Engaged.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. The Citizens' !
State Fair Club met to-night and con- \
sidered various matters in connection !
with the approaching State Fair. E. B.
Willis, managing editor of the Record-

most of them accompanied by their wives,
would enjoy Thursday, _â¢ rlday and Sat
urday of the first week of the State Fair.
Captain H. I. Seymour, chairman of the
committee on local exhibits, reported that
every inch of the lower floor of the vast
exposition building had been engaged and
that until the new exhibitors could In
duce the others to contract their space
an overflow annex would have to be pro
vided.
The Commercial Travelers, the For
esters, the Caledonians, the -Native Sons
and other fraternal and social organiza
tions are each to have a day. at the fair,
and they are already arranging pro
grammes and sending out circulars for
the events.
It is worthy of note that the local Chi
nese and Japanese colonies have become
Interested in the exposition. The Japan
ese are to p.esent some clever athletes
and will show how their native wed&ings
are performed. The Chinese, on the other
hand, will lend the services of a native
orchestra, whose shrill melodies have
often floated across the placid depths of

promise that the State Fair, which opens
in this city September 4, will be one of
the most attractive ever held in Sacra

Francisco filed application with the Coun
ty Clerk to-day for the discharge of his
sister, Mary A. Brunnings, from Agnews

HAVANA, Aug. 7.â General
Jiminez stated to-day that he
would not personally take charge
of an expedition to San Domin
go; at least, not for some time.
He showed me a cipher cable
from an agent In Puerto Plata
saying: "Do not come until we
call for you. You are too valu
able to lose. We can get along
here without you."
Jiminez says that he can di
rect affairs better while in Ha-
vana and can secure more
money, more arms and more
men than if he were in the field
himself. An American to-day
offered Jiminez the services of
1000 Americans, fully armed and
equipped. Jiminez refused them,
saying that he had more men
now than he could use, as well
as arms. General Gomez was in
conference with Jiminez to
night.
The probabilities are that at
the last minute Jiminez will let
the revolution fall through. He
is afraid to take the field him
self and will trust all the work
to lieutenants, who will fail
him. Alfredo Soria, who claims
to be an Intimate friend and ad
visor of the late President
Heureaux, arrived here to-day
and was in close conference
with Jiminez this afternoon. It
is rumored that Jiminez's secre
tary- started for the United
States to-day on the Olivette,
but this could not be confirmed.

PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, Aug. 7.â
â¢ In Hayti the political situation has im
proved. All persons thought capable of
taking part in a revolutionary move
j ment have been arrested or have
sought refuge in the consulates. The
Government is treating the prisoners
with clemency, owing to the interces
sion of the " United . States Minister.
William F. Powell. The financial sit
uation here, however, is still critical.
Pourparlers on the subject have
passed between the Government and
i Minister Powell, who has assured the
Ministers that a loan with suitable
guarantees could certainly be floated in
1 the United States. The only difficulty
1 seems to be the control of the customs,
' which those who are willing to advance
money demand in return for the loan.
This, up to the present, has been re
fused by the Government of Hayti, but
Mr. Powell hopes to persuade the Min
isters to give way. ____;

is to connect the Alum Rock road with the
city and to build a new line to Alviso,
connecting with the first street railroad.
The Alviso franchise probably will be

PEACE COMMISSION IS
ACCOMPLISHING MUCH
Optimistic Letter From President Whi
to Dr. Jordan of Stanford
University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. President Jordan of Stanford
University is in receipt of a private letter from Dr. Andrew D. White,
United States Embassador to Germany and a member of the Interna
tional Peace Commission. The letter Is dated at The Hague. Dr. White
expresses great satisfaction at the outcome of the Peace Convention,
regarding the actual results as much more important than the apparent
ones. The convention must, in his opinion, necessarily open the way for
others of a similar nature and the final result will be the amelioration
of war. the doing away with costly and mischievous armaments and
the ultimate recognition of the principle of arbitration, Which will mean
the establishment of justice, not merely an attempt to reconcile â¢ oppos
ing claims by splitting differences. lÂ».
President White hopes that the American press will realize the situ
ation and will strengthen the work of the convention, not belittle it be
cause it has not at its first session accomplished the impossible nor
done everything that needs doing. It has accomplished all that the
American representatives hoped for and more than they had a right to
expect.

Time.
SAN RAFAEL. Aug. 7.-Though it was

a poor condition that County Treasurer

Last year the levy was 10 cents higher

agance of the Board of Supervisors, it is
claimed, has been such that current de

While this may be true it Is rather pe
culiar that the board has seen fit to
refuse the payment of legitimate bills
incurred by Sheriff Taylor In raiding the
oolro.ms at Sausalito. The condition
of affairs is so bad and the causes lead

threatens to become involved in a scandal.

APPLY FOR HILLARY
"STARR'S LIFE INSURANCE
Relatives of the Missing Man Are of
the Belief That He Is
Dead.
PASADENA. Aug. 7.â Mrs. Hillary S.
Starr has made an application to the
Grand Lodge of the Maccabees, in behalf
of the family, that it pay the claimants
$2000 to cover the insurance that Starr
carried in that organizafion. From the
moment when on the night of April 24
last. Starr, the foreman of the Oak
Knoli ranch, disappeared, until the pres
ent day no tidings have come from the
absent man. The family in making this
demand pursues the theory that Starr is
dead.
To support the claim S. R. Smith man
ager of the Oak Knoll ranch, makes an
affidavit in which he recites the incidents
of the supposed kidnaping, and particu
larizes the footprints, the broken watch
guard, evidences of the struggle and the
mysterious buggy tracks, in an endeavor
to prove that Starr met foul play at the
hands of persons as yet unknown. Sher
iff Hammill of Los Angeles County and
City Marshal Lacey of Pasadena have
prepared statements that their efforts to
find Starr have been unavailing.
Officers of the Maccabees contend that
litigation may follow, and that payment
may for a long time be deferred unless
more convincing proof of death be pro
duced.

the treaty of peace with the Mexican
Government over two years ago.
Captain R. Martin Ross, who is well
known in mining circles of Western
Mexico and Arizona, is a member of one
of the prospecting parties that have
just reached here. He was one of the
flrst Americans to enter the unknown
region two years ago. Previous to that
time he had lived for several years in
Ures, Mexico, and has had a long and
Intimate acquaintance with the Yaquis.
He says that he has been expecting the
outbreak to occur for several months
past. The Indians have never been sat
isfied with the surrender of their lands
and mineral rights, which was made
through the influence of the old men of
the tribe. There is an old tradition
among the Yaqui braves to the effect
that they will Increase in numbers and
power until they rule all the lands of
the setting sun. For the past two cen
turies they have made every effort to
resist allegiance to any outside govern
ment, and it did not require much agi
tation to induce the present revolution
against the Mexican Government.
In reference to the danger of Amer
ican prospectors in the Yaqui country.
Captain Ross states that they had the
first warning of the outbreak and the
most of them will have an opportunity
to escape. He estimates that there are
not over 500 American mining men in
the turbulent territory. Several thou
sand prospectors went into the country
from the United States when it was
first opened, but the majority of them
met with disappointment in their search
for gold and did not remain long.
Captain Ross also reports that the
Yaqui braves are in two divisions. One
division is located in the Suhua
rlpa Mountains and the other in
the Bacatete Mountains. Each of these
main forces numbers about 2000 men,
and in addition there are numerous
small bands of roving warriors who are
committing most of the murders and
outrages in the valley.
Another regiment of Mexican cavalry
has just passed through here on its way
to the northern part of the Yaqui coun
try. It is understood this regiment will
be used to drive the force of Indians out
of the Suhuaripa Mountains. A large
force of troops are moving up the valley
from the south.

SILVER TROPHIES FOR RIVAL
STATE BOYS IN BLUE TO WIN
Utah and Pennsylvania to Meet on the Diamond.
WHEN the Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers and the Utah Light Ar
tillery returned from the Philippiw a with splendid records won in the
field the newspapers throughout the country extolled their deeds
and published to the world their splendid achievements. Two victo
ries were won by the commands which were omitted in the pub
lished accounts, but to the members of the regiment and battery as much
pride is taken in describing the battles as any in which they participated.
Marry trophies were carried away from Manila, but none more beautiful and
more Interesting than the two silver cups wen by the representatives of the
-eminent and battery by prowess on the diamond. During the prolonged stay
of the volunteer regiments In the Philippines time hung heavily on the hands
of the soldiers. To relieve the monotony the American Commercial Com] of
Manila offered two cups to be contested for by nines from the commands
ihen stationed In the city. The incentive started the men practicing and
within a short time nine men were chosen in m each regiment to uphold the
honor of their organisations. The series of games played were watched by
thousands of soldiers and natives and among the former caused intense ex
citement and enthusiasm. The Pennsylvania*** succeeded in capturing the
first series and were awarded the cup. In the second series the victors did
not participate and Utah's representatives carried off the trophy.
It was the intention of the victors to play for the cups and the champion
ship of Manila, but orders to return to the United States prevented the con
test taking place. The challenge was renewed a few days ago and on Sun
day next the two nines will battle for supremacy on the baseball field at the
Presidio. Both aggregations are assiduously practicing and the game prom
ices to be extremely lively. Charley Newman of the Richelieu, in whose place
the- cups are now on exhibition, has furnished the teams with baseballs and
bats and also promises to furnish refreshments ty the men during the game
and a big dinner to the victorious nine.
It is probable thai Utah will again send forth the nine men who.- did so
we il on the Manila diamond. The team is composed of W. F. Griffiths (cap
tain! H. Klenke, K. A. Walgast, VV. H. Seaver, T. S. Gunn, N. < '. Margetts,
Lieutenant K. C. Naylor, XV. H. Shearer, E. H. Roberts Jr. Lindsay Hudson.
manager of the aggregation, is confident of victory. The Pennsylvanians have
not as .',,.. decided on their line-up. They are anxious to add another trophy
to their* collection and intend putting forth the best talent to do it.

SHAMROCK TO BE TOWED
ONLY DURING CALMS
New York Yacht Club Explains the
Concession Made to Sir
Thomas Lipton.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Aug. 7.â The
New York Yacht Club, learning that the
Shamrock was being towed, to-night is
sued the following statement:
In relation to the statement that the Sham
rock had been reported in tow of a steamer in
lisht order off Tuska, and as such action ls re
garded in violation of the deed of the gift and
the conditions governing the match for the
America's cud, the officers of the New York
Yacht Club desire to state that some time
since a communication was received from a
representative of Sir Thomas Linton announc
ing the intention of the latter to take a south
erly course for the Shamrock, and asking
whether in view of the probability of encoun
tering calms on the proposed route it would be
deemed a violation of the match if the Sham
rock availed herself of the presence of a steam
yacht to bo towed during the calm spells.
In view of the fact of the entire good faith
In which the request was made and that the
towing would subject the vessel to greater
strain than the sailing and could therefore not
be made a pretext for evading th? conditions of
the deed of gift that the challenger should
proceed on her own bottom to the port of con
test, the officers of the club sent an answer to
the effect that the New York Yacht Club would
take no exception to the Shamrock being towed
during calm Intervals between breezes. Its
action in consenting not to object to such a
course should not be regarded, however, as a
precedent, and Is applicable only to this par
ticular case.

LAWIOR AND TURNER DRAW.
Honors Even in Their Twenty-Round
Go at Stockton.
STOCKTON. Aug. 7.â The first fights
of the newly incorporated San Joaquin
Club, composed of sporting men of Stock
ton, took place to-night and Avon The
ater was crowded with interested specta
tow*. The first mill was between Young
Peter Jackson and Charlie Turner of
Stockton, once a clever pugilist but now
stale. Jackson was the better man and
in the second round Turner was counted
out to save him from punishment.
The event of the evening was a 20-round
go between Jimmie Lawlor of San Fran
cisco and Rube Turner of Stockton, both
weighing 134 pounds. It was a pretty
sparring match, though rather tame for
the spectators, who wanted- knockout
blows. Both men fought cautiously. I.aw
lor led the oftener. but Turner countered
best. In the twentieth round the fight was
very even and declared a draw, the purse
of *.*"00 being divided. The decision of
Charley Oliver, the referee, was received
with satisfaction. 'â *

a dozen meetings of as many
different committees were held and
much work accomplished.
As a result the decoration commit
tee was allowed $6000 to start with
for the illumination of the city, with
a promise of more if possible and it

The Native Sons' committee is
busy arranging for places in the line ;
cf parade for the many societies that
have signified a desire to march.
PARADE plans of the Native Sons
and Daughters on ' reception ' day
may be so changed as to allow of a
purely military procession during the
t afternoon and a grand civic and mili
tary parade at night under the canopy of
incandescent lamps which it is the pur
pose of the citizens' decoration- commit
tee to put in place..
This idea, suggested earlier in the day.
was laid before the Native Sons' and
Daughters' parade' committee last night
by W. J. Martin of the citizens' executive
committee. He said that the citizens' dec
oration committee would have $6000 for its
purposes and would in- pleased to have
the Native Sons and Daughters act with
it to secure the best results for the ex
penditure.
Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr.. representing
th( Mayor, said it was the desire of the
citizens' committee to have a purely mili
tary parade In the day time and at night
a joint parade of the military and civic
societies, but if that did not meet the
views of the Native Sons and Daughters,
who had taken the initiative in the re
ception, the citizens' committee would do
all that could be done to work in har
mony with them.
-Mr. Martin said the citizens' committee
has in contemplation a banquet to the
soldiers, but that no arrangements would
I-.- made that would in any way Interfere
with the banquet the Native Sons and
Daughters have arranged.
I A general discussion followed concern
g the time of holding the grand parade,
r. Mcl'ike. Mr. Maritn and Mr. Mor
rrstern taking part. It was finally de
led to appoint a committee to confer
th tin. citizens' committee at 11 o'clock
is morning in Mayor Phelan's private
Ree, with power to determine whether j
c grand parade shall be In the day time :
at night. L. F. Byington, A. _.. Mor
â¢nstern, J. \\*. Lewis, _. H. S. Dryden
id Mrs; Mary E. Tillman were named as
i at committee. ' â 
After the adjournment there was an in
rmal talk, and the sentiment was
rongly in favor of acting upon the Idea
the citizens' committee, as all seemed
realize that it would be better to have
â¢i military reception in the morning and
c grand parade by the military and
civic organizations at night, as it would :
lable more to join In the ranks and '
the brilliant display to be made by the
citizens' committee would add greatly to

ade It is likely that the vote to-day will

DEDICATION OF THE BIG TENT IN UNION-SQUARE.
THE headquarters tent in Union-square Park, intended as a gathering place, reading-room and depository for re
turning volunteers will be dedicated this evening to what promises to be a long career of usefulness.
" The ceremonies attendant on the dedication will be made more than usually interesting. A. M. I,****- renr-v who

ferry depot and City Hall, $4000.
Marx also made a proposition to string
5000 lights across Market street from the
ferry to Larkin for $2900.
The Tidball-Marx proposition was de
clared at once to be beyond the reach of
the means It was thought would be placed
in the hands of the executive committee.
Chairman Martin stated* that the in
vitation to attend the meeting had been
extended Messrs. de Young and Lawrence
for i.he purpose of obtaining their views
concerning the amount of money that
would be appropriated for decoration. Mr.
de Young said that was not possible to
tell at the present stage of the financier-
Ins: Mr. Lawrence was of the opinion
that there should be $8000 or $10,000 for
decorations. Mr. Martin said he did not
see how there could be any sort of decora
tion lor a night parade short' of .S6OOO.
"What couid you do with $7000.' asked
Mr. Lawrence. '- * â 'â '- Â_ . _
The members of the commit.cc, who
had practically derided that they .did not
want an electric arch, seemed to think
that $7500 would be sufficient.
It was decided to ask the executive com
mittee immediately for some figure upon
which the decoration committee could
work with certainty, and the members ad
lourned till the afternoon at 1:30 o clock
at the office of the I'nion Trust Company.
Upon reassembling Chairman W. J. Mar
tin informed the committee of the action
of the executive committee in allowing
the sum of $6000 for an electrical display.
â¢â¢It is now in order," he said, for the
committee to spend the money judiciously
to obtain the best results."
After a long discussion it was ordered
en motion of Charles Hirsch that Reid
Brothers, the architects, be asked to fur
nish the foil- .wing plans and specifica
tions:
Fur the electrical decoration of the City Hall
dome. , , Â tf 1 !
For the decoration of the dome, including the

pose consists of Messrs. Hirsch, Holbrook

tions have been finished the denotation

for the electrical decoration. If the funds
hold out the committee will elaborate on
the details.
Chairman Martin stated that he would
confer with the Native Sons' committee
with the idea previously suggested that by
changing their programme they would be
able to help out the decoration commit
tee. '-.'." -'-'.
It was decided that the committee would
for the present take up the question of
electrical decoration alone and request ail
citizens to decorate their residences and
business places as they desired.
Messrs. Hellman, Mills and Thayer were
appointed a committee "to wait on electric
light companies and request the donation
of the necessary current for illumination

W. H. Mills, brought up the matter of

BOAT OWNERS WILL
SWELL THE FUND
THE executive council of the finance committee raising funds for the recep
tion of the returning volunteers was greatly encouraged in its work yes
terday by a statement made by Harbor Commissioner Kilburn. Several
days ago the Harbor Commission*; rs were appointed a committee to canvass
the owners of steamers, tugs, launches and Other small craft for the
purpose of ascertaining how many of them were willing to run excursions
on Reception day, turning over the proceeds to the reception committee.
Commmissioners Kilburn and Harney put in yesterday forenoon on the er
rand. The result is best told in Commissioner Kilburn's own words:
"We saw the owners of a great many small craft," he said, and not one
of them but promised to do as we asked. It all remains with the people to
swell the fund. Major Harney's Idea and mine is that excursionists be
charged 50 cents a head to go out on the bay to meet the transports. We
are satisfied that there will be at least 20,000 people willing to avail them
selves of the opportunity at that price. If that is the case it is only a matter
of carrying capacity for us to add $10,000 to the reception fund.
The entire matter will be settled to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock at a
meeting of shipowners in the Harbor Commissioners' office.
XV. J. Martin, chairman of the decoration
committee. He stated that his committee
was anxious, in order to proceed intel
ligently, to know how much money would
in- appropriated to it. On being asked
how much money would be required for
the night display. Mr. Martin replied at
least $6000. On motion of Mr. de Voting
the decoration committee, was authorized
to spend that amount, with the under
standing that if it is found possible later
to Increase the amount it will he done.
It was the general opinion that the
decollation question was the most im
portant one of all, and the committee was
Inclined to be generous on that point.
The $6000 will not Include the fireworks
display. In this connection the Chinese
Arm of "Wing Fat & Co. .set a good ex
ample by offering to donate Its surplus
stock of fireworks left over from Fourth
of July.
Mr. de Young presented the following
resolutions providing for a proper organ
ization of the executive committee:
Resolvedâ That no liabilities be in- i
curred by any committee or member without
th. proper authority from the executive com- i
mittee.
â¢ Secondâ That the secretary shall keep a rec- .
ord of all contracts entered into and all lia- ;
bilities incurred.
Thirdâ The sub-committees are only author
ized to spend moneys within the limitations
set by the executive committee and the
amounts appropriated for the purposes of said j
committee. -.*'.â¢â¢"
Fourthâ All bills shall lie presented to the j
executive committee to be audited and certi- i
fied by the chairman and secretary to the
treasurer, who alone will have power to pay i
them.
Fifth â Payments will be made by check in
every Instance except where the amounts are i
under $10.

SULTANS. SULU fIND UTfIH-
THE Mahometan Sultan of Sulu is rattling in the
pocket of his broad-hulled trousers $10,000 in
American gold and has on file a contract, made
in the name of the American people, for the payment
to him of an annual subsidy of $20,000 in the same
coin, as his reward for being a Yankee and acknowl
edging our jurisdiction. The taxpayers who furnish
the money may wonder why we paid Spain twenty
millions for the sovereignty of all those islands and
then pay the Sultan a salary to admit our title. The
presumption is that in default of the salary he would
have disputed our authority, and there is room for
still more speculation why we salary him and shoot
the Christian Filipinos.
Our agreement with him stipulates mat we musi
leave him undisturbed in the religion and institutions
of his people.; That religion is Mohametan, and the
institutions are polygamy and chattel slavery. While
we extend our jurisdiction over the Koran
and polygamy and salary the Sultan who be
lieves in the one and practices the other the
Stars and Stripes, protecting the harems of
Sulu, waves as a banner of virtuous vengeance to
strike terror into the harems of Utah. The Book of
Mormon and the continuing revelations that pro
ject it, like the Koran, teach polygamy as a religious
duty, not assumed exactly as a burden but rather as a
means of offsetting certain austerities in the obser
vance of creed and ritual. Pious as Mormondom is,
the Utah basin would smile if a brother should lead
his plural mates to the altar protesting against the
privilege as a burden and a frowning providence not
lined by a dollar's worth of silver.
The Book of Mormon is built on the Koran and
the Code Napoleon. It establishes in Utah one of
the institutions which we recognize and protect in the
Sulus. It is on the principle that surfeit of a good
thing is impossible, and throughout it converts to
highly spiritual purposes that cheerful song â
"When you get a good thing
Keep it, keep it."
Whereas the Koran stops at four wives per husband,
the Mormon establishment puts no limit on the
game. But, if it is a praiseworthy institution, de
serving a salary and distinguished consideration in
Sulu, what's a limit among friends? But the United
States, which looks upon plurality of wives in the
Sulus and calls it good, looks upon the same in Utah
-md calls it an abomination before the Lord! â¢
When Utah was admitted as a State the Unites
States made a contract with her which bears no. re
semblance to the one made with the Sulu Sultan
Congress bound Utah to observe the principles of the
Declaration of Independence and to forever abjure
polygamy or, plural marriage. Congress forced the
incorporation of the Tucker-Edmunds law into the
first statutes of the new State, fixing fine and im
prisonment as the penalty of keeping a harem. In
Utah there are twelve Sultans. They are called the
First Presidency of the Church, and are sometimes
known as the Twelve Apostles. One of them, the
Sultan Angus Cannon, determined to live up to hi
religion and obey the spirit rather than the statutes,
has been getting married at every drop of the hat for
the last year or two, until his harem numbers six
ladies. But his further career as a family man has
been cut off. The law has its grip on him, and he ha
pleaded guilty to an act which is repaid with a fine an;
jail in Utah and with an annual salary and protection
in the Sulus all under the flag and jurisdiction of the
United States!
The Utah Battery has just returned from the Phil
ippines. In it are many Mormons and a grandson of
Brigham Young. , They left the Sultan of Sulu in
good health, well and abundantly married and paid
a salary. They find one of the Sultans of Utah, also
well and abundantly married, pining in a dungeon
therefor. They also find the same flag over the Utah
jail that they have been engaged in nailing to the
Philippines. May we not expect a great emigration
movement from Salt Lake to Sulu?

HAWAIIAN LABOR.
1- J
IN an interview on the "wide open coolie and con
tract labor policy in Hawaii Senator Perkins de
clares that his act to prevent the importation of
coolies would have passed the Senate except for an
objection interposed by Senator Morgan of Alabama.
Senator Perkins, therefore, charges Morgan with the
responsibility of permitting the violation of every
promise that was made the American people by the
annexation crowd. It will be remembered that every
organ of annexation insisted that under the joint reso
lution of Congress, which effected the union of
Hawaii to this country, contract labor would be im
possible and coolies could not enter the islands. The
Call at that time pointed out the fallacy of this state
ment and predicted just what has happened. Nearly
30,000 coolies have been imported under penal con
tracts, and an energetic effort has been made to get
Italians and Portuguese under the same form of con
tract. Between coolie contract labor in Hawaii, as
now existing under c*ir flag and jurisdiction, and
slave labor in the South before the Civil War, if
there be any difference, it is in favor of the slave la
bor as far as the condition of the individual is con
cerned.
There has been talk in Honolulu of convening the
Island Legislature to repeal the penal clause in the
labor contract laws. It will be remembered that while
annexation was before Congress a bill to effect this
repeal was introduced in the Hawaiian Legislature,
and the annexation agents from the islands and the
American newspapers they had bribed gave the most
solemn assurances that the repeal should be passed.
Millions of Americans read this promise, and believe
even now that it was carried out, but it was not, nor
will it be until the people of this country force these
manipulators to keep faith.
The statement by Senator Perkins is of first impor
tance because it fixes responsibility for this condition
of things. Senator Morgan tried in vain to dictate a
foreign policy to Mr. Cleveland, and, failing, turned
and fought the administration of his own party with
a reckless disregard for truth and for the decencies of
official life that tarnished throughout the world the
reputation of public life in this republic. He has
wrought ceaselessly to impose his fantastic ideas of
foreign policy upon President McKinley's adminis
tration, and good Republicans have omitted any ex
pression of pleasure at seeing the counsel of men like
Senator Hoar and ex-Senator Edmunds rejected
while Morgan made himself a mouthpiece of an ad
ministration of which he is the natural political
enemy.
Morgan's party in the campaign next year will at- :
tack the Republicans upon the very policy which he
tried to force upon Cleveland, and it is well to bear
in mind the origin of that policy.
President McKinley sent Morgan as a Commis
sioner to Honolulu to make an examination of the
status in the islands and report a code to Congress
for the government of that country. This work was
supposed to be done, and at any rate was paid for by
the American taxpayers. It was expected by Ameri
can employers that the employers of labor in the
islands would be at once forced to assume legal
equality with them. It was also expected by Ameri
can laborers that their wages and their hours of labor
would not be imperiled by coolie contract competition
in Hawaii. And by the whole people it was expected
that the solemn promises made by the annexationists
would be kept. But every one of these expectations
has been disappointed. Every promise has been bra
zenly violated, and Senator Perkins states publicly
that Senator Morgan is responsible, and the people
believe him. The Democracy of California made a
ribboned ox out of Morgan when he was here. Their j
official and personal attentions to him were of the
highest order. His leadership was hailed in voices j
scented by every variety of spirits used to keep up j
party courage, from steam beer to Mumra. He es- !
pecially delighted them by coarse and ribald abuse of
Cleveland. Now it appears that instead of going to j
Hawaii to do his duty to the Republican administra- j
tion which honored him, and to the people who paid j
him, he went to consult the island tricksters and to I
concert ways and means for maintaining servile labor j
there, to the damage of American workmen, and re
turned to deceive the President who sent him by im
peding the performance of promises for which the
administration was responsible. The Republican
party, remembering the words of Lincoln, insists
upon equality before the law for everybody within the
jurisdiction of the United States.
When Great Britain abolished slavery Freedom
touched with her emancipating chrism every foot of
British soil. It became and has remained the boast
of British statesmen that the genius of universal
emancipation spread her wings over the empire, and
when the foot of a slave touched that soil his chains !
fell off and his bonds were broken.
Among the other national shames that are upon us
shall we have to blush for the betrayal of American
labor and denial to it of universal equality before the
law wherever the flag floats? That is the position in i
which the Morgan policy has put us. Will not the
leaders of the Republican party extricate us from the
control of this Alabaman Mokanna?
Deny it as he may, Emperor William can no longer
disguise his hostility to America and Americans. He
threw off the mask the other day when he proffered
the services of the skipper of the Meteor to sail the
Shamrock against the Columbia.

THE DUTY OF THE DAY.
ATTEND the primaries. Go to the polling
booths and vote for the candidates who repre
sent the better elements of citizenship. That
is the duty of every citizen; it is in a special sense
the duty of taxpayers, of property-owners, of indus
trious workingmen, of all who constitute the intelli
gence, honesty and the progressiveness of the com
munity.
Fair-minded Democrats can see no prospect of
good government in their party, dominated as it must
be either by the faction of Buckley or by that of
Rainey and the Examiner. Within the Republican !
party, however, there is a bright prospect of victory
for intelligence and honesty. If the citizens who have
a true regard for public welfare will act in accordance I
with that regard, all will be well. Good men will con
trol the Republican convention, and thus there will
be assured the nomination of a ticket which good men
of all parties can support against any ticket that may
be named by either the Buckleyites or the Rainey
iles of the Democratic camp.
The Call has no special set of men to champion.
Let each Republican ; go over the list of candidates
from his district and vote for those whom he knows
to be gcod and true. No man known as a tool of the
bosses or of the railroad should receive the support of
an intelligent voter. Such men cannot have the wel
fare of the community at heart, nor can they, be
counted on to vote in the convention for the nomina
THE SAN FSAiNCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 1899.
tion of able, public-spirited men. It is, in fact, to de
feat just such candidates that good citizens should at
tend to their political duties.
Every taxpayer, every business man, every indus
trious workingman, has a personal concern in the
struggle of the day. An honest, progressive,: busi
ness-like administration of municipal affairs will be of
personal benefit to every good citizen. Bad govern
ment will entail deficient public services and heavy
burdens of taxation. For their own interests, there
fore, as well as from a sense of civic patriotism, all
should make it a point to take part in the primaries.
By the votes cast to-day it will be virtually deter
mined whether San Francisco is to have a good gov
ernment under the new charter or not. It is nou#
possible to elect good men to the Republican conven
tion and so assure a strong and reliable ticket. He
who is willing to act for the city as well as to talk
must act to-day, must attend the primaries to-day,
must vote for good men to-day. To-morrow it will be
too late.

PLEDGES FAITHFULLY KEPT.
WITH the adoption of a tax levy within the
dollar limit the Republican majority of the
Board of Supervisors have kept faith with the
public on that issue, and the party can now point to
a record of official service remarkable for its fidelity
to campaign promises.
The subject merits the attentive consideration of
voters. As it is the rule to denounce an official who
proves false, so it should be the rule to give honor
to those who are faithful, and under that rule the
Republican Supervisors deserve and should receive
the commendations of their fellow citizens.
The Republican platform, after declaring in favor
of municipal ownership of public utilities, went on. to
.say: "Until that result is accomplished we pledge
our nominees for Supervisor* to fix a water rate which
will net the Spring Valley Water Company not more
than 5 per cent on its capital stock, providing that the
operating and constructing expenses of the corpora
tion be reduced to an amount that is fair and equal.
To that end we pledge our said nominees to make .1
careful and methodical investigation of the books of
the company.''
That pledge has been kept, and water rates both to
the municipality and to private consumers have been
reduced in accordance with it.
On the subject of the lighting supply of the city
the platform said: "The charge for gas and electric
light should be reduced and the quality improved,
and the city should have its lamps lighted every night
in the year. The lighting of the city constitutes a
large and necessary item of public expense. We fa
vor legislation which will encourage competition for
this contract and secure to the public the maximum
of efficient service at the minimum of expense. We
are in favor of placing underground all electric wires,
and we pledge our nominees to secure these results." <
The three demands set forth in that plank have been
complied with. The cost of lighting has been re
duced to the municipality and to private parties, the
Supervisors have provided for competition by grant
ing franchises to competing companies, and electric
wires are required to be put underground.
The platform asserted: "The affairs of the munici
pality should be conducted upon principles of hon
esty and economy that prevail, in private business.
Conducted on these principles a tax of one dollar per
hundred dollars of an assessed valuation of $350,000.
--000 will be amply sufficient properly to operate the
municipal government. We therefore pledge our can
didates for the office of Supervisor to limit the annual
tax levy to an amount not exceeding that which will
be produced by a tax of one dollar for every hundred
dollars of assessed valuation not exceeding
$350,000,000."
By the action taken yesterday that pledge is ful
filled, and after years of struggle the people will at
last, thanks to the Republican majority of the board,
have a fair test made of the dollar limit tax.
On the subject of assessments the platform de
clared: "We pledge our nominees for the Board of
Supervisors, sitting as a Board of Equalization, and
our nominee for Assessor, to the levying of all assess
ments upon an absolutely fair and equal basis. We
insist that as between rich and poor, corporation and
private citizen, there shall be no discrimination, that
the burdens of government shall be borne in equal
proportion by all classes, and that in the assessment
of corporate franchises care shall be taken to de
termine the reasonable value of such franchises in their
relation to more tangible property vested in the cor
porations -assessed by deducting the value of the en
tire tangible property of such corporations from the
market value of their stocks and bonds."
The Republican party did not elect the Assessor,
but the Republican majority of the Board of Equali
zation set itself earnestly to the task of revising the
assessments made by the Democratic incumbent of
that office. They increased the assessment of the
Market Street Railway Company, and would have
increased that of the Sutter street line and those of
other corporations had not the Democratic minority
by dilatory tactics prevented. Even with such ob
stacles to contend with the Republican Supervisors
acting as Equalizers have fulfilled that plank of the
platform to the extent at least of giving the city the
fairest assessment of property made within the life
of this generation.
, Such is the record of pledges fulfilled by the Repub
lican Supervisors. The six great issues which made
up the points of popular interest in the campaign last
year have been met in accord with the demands of the
people and the promises of the party. First, water
rates have been reduced. Second, gas and electric
rates have been reduced. Third, competition in gas
and ele-tric lighting has been encouraged and pro
vided for. Fourth, electric wires have been required
to be laid underground. Fifth, the dollar limit of
taxation has been adopted. â  Sixth, assessments have
been equalized better than ever before between the
private citizen and corporations, between the rich and
the poor.
On that showing of fidelity and honesty the Re
publican party can justly ask the continued support
of the voters in the municipal campaign.

NEW YORK HEIRESS
MADE- SCHOOL INSPECTOR
THE appointment of Miss Elsie Clews as school inspector for the Four
teenth District, New York, which has Just been made public, is a recogni
tion of the educational philanthropy the young heiress has practiced since
her graduation. On emerging from Barnard ln 1896 Miss Clews' first public
work was done ln the interests of the Citizens' Union and Seth Low's cam
paign for the Mayoralty. The Woman's Auxiliary of the union was* recruited
from New York's wealthy and exclusive classâ women who had dabbled in poli
tics only in the abstract, as a study of the aspects of the municipality.
Miss Clews' was one of the earliest signatures In the list of those publicly
pledged to support the union. She was one of the busiest workers ln the organiz
ing of meetings in all parts of the city, and was one of those on the platform at
the big mass-meeting in Cooper Union when ex-Mayor Strong was chairman
and Low, Choate, Waring and Carter among the speakers.
Miss Clews is a member of the League for Political Education, which contrib
uted so large a quota to the Union Auxiliary. The league has achieved Its political
ends, which are purely educational, largely through sociological means. The As
sembly district work, one of its specialties, brought its members into direct con
tact with the lives of the families of voters ln each district, with a view of improv
ing existing conditions and so helping to an Intelligent comprehension of muni
cipal needs.
Miss Clews' inspectorship will naturally prove of value in smoothing out school
difficulties. She is the only daughter of the banker, Henry Clews. Her mother has
been famous not alone as a belle but as one of the best-educated women of the
Four Hundred. ''. tftftf -'â¢'_;>"
Miss Clews herself holds the degree of doctor of philosophy, conferred by Co

Apache Volunteers A Lapse of
Memory.
Editor of The Call: Your paper this
morning announces a scheme on foot to
secure 10,000 Apache braves for use against
the Filipinos, for whose sole offense of
loving their country and hating, subjec
tion we are now at war with them.
In this It would appear that the Jingo
advocates of this benevolent scheme have
suffered another lapse of memory as to
the text of the supposed to be immortal
Declaration of Independence. Not that
their past record renders this further evi
dence at all surprising, but it furnishes
one more among an eloquent aggregation
of facts, showing >a mighty cleavage oil
their part, away from the principles of
just government. They either forget, or
ignore those passages of Jefferson s
matchless indictment against King
George, wherein it is charged:
"He has plundered our seas,
ravaged our coasts, burned our
towns and destroyed the lives of
our people.
"He has excited domestic in
surrection among us, and has en
deavored to bring on the inhabi
tants of our frontiers the merci
less Indian savages, whose known
rule of warfare is an undistin
guished destruction of all ages,
sexes and conditions."
Without claiming for the proposed dis
patch of savages to prey upon the Fili
pino patriots any greater degree of incon
sistency with American doctrine than has
marked the course of the Jingoes to date,
I would gladly learn by what alchemic
process an act becomes right when prac
ticed by McKinley upon the Filipinos
which was atrocious when practiced by
King George upon the Americans?

Give the Naval Reserve a Chance.
Editor The Call: California furnished
sixty-five men and ten officers from the
Naval Militia at San Francisco, who gave
up their homes and positions to serve for
Old Glory. They enlisted in a body at the
breaking out of the war and served
throughout on board the United States
steamers Iroquois and Vigilant. Although
these men did not see active service, they
were ready and went where the Secretary
of the Navy sent them. Ask Captain L.
H. Turner, who commanded the Iroquois
(formerly the tug Fearless), also Captain
Gunn of the Vigilant, and I am sure they
will have nothing but praise for their
men. Although they are the only volun
teers San Francisco* furnished from the
State militia besides our homeward
bound heroes, they are not Included in
any of the<festlvities mapped out. There
are seventy-five of them, nearly all of
whom since their discharge serving the
State on board the Marion.
If nothing more, they are at least en
titled to be included in the honorary es
cort of our home-coming heroes. Hoping
The Call will see justice done to her San
Francisco volunteer sailors, I am. very
respectfully, JOHN E. BROWN,

While the Examiner confined Its Inter

teers wholly to their opinions of the con

its interviews to the availability of the
islands for white labor and the character
of the people. Their views as to the en

are unanimous as to every one of the j

They differ as to the availability of the
Filipinos for citizenship, some holding
they would make excellent citizens and
others quite the contrary- Let them be
citizens of their own country and not of
ours is the consensus of opinion. In other
words, leave them alone, and they will
work out their own salvation.

Mayor Phelan's Attemp*. to Do Business With the

Would Avoid Responsibility.
The Supervisors have made good an
other of the i ledges upon which they
were electedâ the tax levy is fixed Within
the dollar limit.
It was neither the levy of the Mer
chants' Association nor that of Mayor
Phelan which they adopted yesterday. It i
was one of the board's own, although I
drawn on the lines that the merchants I
and the Mayor had laid down as proper j
within the pledge. The schedules which
they recently submitted the finance com
mittee could not use in toto. Ignorance ;
>'f municipal affairs led the merchants to |
certain mistakes which would have ren
dered the success of their levy an im
possibility; and Mayor Phelan, In at- j
tempting to pander more to politics a4Â«d
his immediate future than to the public
good, nail discriminated in favor of cer
tain funds to the detriment of others to
the extent that chaos would have resulted
in the rity's government had his schedule j
been indorsed. I
In the main, however, it was followed.
His figures for the School Department j
were allowed to stand; his suggestion that
the Golden Gate Park fund be reduced !
from '--â  "â  to t_l4,ouo was adopted and
his plan was further followed In cutting j
uown the appropriation for copying the j
assessment books from $1200 to (MM. Also
pursuant to his suggestion the committee
eliminated the position of chief clerk to
tne District Attorney, thus cutting oil
tin***) in municipal expense, but as District
Attorney .uurpny appeared uunng tne
meeting.ana pointed out clearly that that
position was statutory, despite the
Aluyor's contrary contention, the water
tund was shaveu down the tloOv* necessary
_nd the position re-established.
The disposition of the board was to in
crease tne appropriation ol the County â¢
i_ierk's office, out here again tne Mayor
intervened and his decision that Clerk :
Deane should have no more than the stat
ute allows him compelled the board lo
adhere to the figure already fixed, in
tact Mayor elan's figures were abided j
by in nearly every case where it was not i
Eiaririgty arent that some fund had
"ten sughtea for another for the purpose j
ot raising political capital.
Tnere Â»tit two notable except! ns tor

Phelan in his attacK upon City Hall jani

pronounced inclination to reduce the
wages of city help has been In evidence
since the ast election, when in an ill- ,
guardea moment he expressed the opinion
that **4'J per month was enough â¢lot any
man doing that class of work. In- levy
which he submit the other day not only

In offering the report of the r-inanpe
Committee yesterday -supervisor P-.irault,
the chairman, said it had been apparent
since lasi January that the city could not
he operated on a levy within the dollar
limit. He sail every member of the board
realized this, but that in deference to Ml*.
Pheian's larger experience iii municipal
arTaits they had abided by his decision
thai it could be done and that he would ,
point the way to do it. Mr. Ph-uu*. was
quick to deny this, but he subside when -.
Dr. Perrau produced the record. in
fact. Mr. Phelan was prone to deny c* ci y
thing that tended to place on hi.* shoul
ders the responsibility which he asoumed ,
early in the year for the operation of a
tax lew constructed inside the pledge.
The report of the Finance Committee
did not deal lightly nor delicately with '
the attitude Mr. Phelan has maintained â 
since the tax levy was first discussed. His
original message on that question pi< dgod
himself to the dollar limit, and he _Â»:bse
quently volunteered to ad the way in :
whicii the Supervisors should walk to
stay within the prescribed lines, V- ster
day the Supervisors adopted all but his !
political scheme, but during the reading |
of the report, which recited his various
suggestions, he frantically attempted to
dodge all responsibility for the success or
non-success of the instrument, th text
of which he had practically framed.
The efforts of the Mayor to g'.-t from
under should his political dollar limit
schemes go wrong have been so pro
nounced the past fortnight that the com
mittee was constrained to state its posi
tion in its report. Upon that point it said:
His Honor the Mayor's opinions, he
being the exponent of the require
ments of the government under the
consolidation act and under the new
charter, have been given much
weight and his suggestions in the
main have been adopted in the con
sideration of retrenchments to be ef
fected, without reference to any other
consideration, political or otherwise.
As the responsibility for the main
tenance and operation of the govern
ment to be instituted next January
is freely assumed by his Honor the
Mayor, your committee certainly can
have no motive other than to second
his efforts to secure either under the
present or the new regime an eco
nomical and successful administra
tion of the public business.
"I object to that passage," shouted Mr.
Phelnn. "I have never assumed respon- I
sibility for the tax levy." j
"1 apologize to your Honor," retorted
Supervisor Perrault. "We have been led j
to believe from reading the Examiner ,
that you had pre-empted the Mayor's,
chair for the next term of offlce."
Upon Mr. Phelan's suggestion to reduce
the force and wages of City Hall janitors
and employes, the report of the commit
tee was particularly severe, so severe,
in fact, that the Mayor again rose in his
wrath to deny that he had ever said any
such thing. Dr. Perrault simply called
on the transcript of the shorthand re
porter to back him up. and that not be
ing forthcoming a decision went over
until the next meeting. In every case
where his name was mentioned or his
connection with the tax levy was hinted
at Mr. Phelan was' ready with a dis
claimer. He had submitted a levy and
the board had followed its suggestions so
far as It was practicable, but ne wanted
It understood that he was not responsible
fur what he had done, and said so in the
sharpest language.
The principal changes made by the com
mittee in its original schedule were in
the cases of the Health Department, the
Fire. Department and the City and County
Hospital. It increased the Health De
partment's fund $15.9'"0, or enough to pro
vide for the Ferry Hospital and the Food
Inspection Department. The City and
County Hospital fund was Increased from
$80,000 to $111,906 and $1305 was added for
repairs. The Almshouse fund was raised
from $75,000 to $90,000 and a high tribute
paid to Captain Beddy for his adminis
tration of the institution. The reduced
figures for the Tax Collector submitted
by the Mayor were agreed to, but the
water fund* was Increased from $250,000
to $259,000 and the Street Department was
raised from $353,000 to $402,204.
When the report came up for adoption
the Mayor demanded that the passages
he had objected to be stricken out. He
said no gentleman would make such
things a part of any report he might have
occasion to write. Supervisor Byington
thought so, too, and so did Mr. Deasy.
Supervisor Perrault was quite willing to
withdraw all personal allusion until such
time IS the stenographer's minutes were
ready to prove what had been said, and
he moved to "strike out" with the un
derstanding that that section of the
Bhorthand report dealing with the Mayor j
.t.,,,, . . -tftf tf tftf
fnouicl be spread upon the minutes His
motion was carried.
Mr. Collins moved to adopt the new levy
and pledge the board to re-enact it upon
the third Moi lay in November. Deasv
moved to recommit and Holland moved
to lay Deasy'S motion on tlie table. It
was so ordered. Then Collins' motion was
put to a vote and carried the Democrats
voting with Republican members in its
_â r 'i _ ,
l^nelps offered a resolution to adjourn
untll September 11, but as there was con
siderable work on hand he withdrew it
until Monday next.

FAREWELL TO
SERVICE, SAY
OREGON MEN
The Regiment Mus
tered Out.
MEN AND OFFICERS PAID OFF
Lively Scenes Out at the Presidio
During the Breaking of the
Northern Boys'
Camp.
The closing scenes of the military life j
i of the Second Oregon Volunteers were en- j
i acted yesterday. The men were given j
! their discharges, they were all paid off ,
I and by nightfall the camp that has. been
'so busy was almost deserted. Most of the
! men spent the night in town. A few came
I back to the camp and spent the night
. there after passing the first hours of free
dom in the city, but out of the whole ra- ,
iment there were not more than one hun
dred to be found in the tents two hours
after the last company had been mustered
out.
Before the actual mustering out of the
men began General Summers lined up his
regiment and addressed his soldiers. He
spoke of the cordial relations which hud |
existed between the men and their oitt- |
cers, the willingness of the regiment to
obey orders ana perform any duty and j
of the record it had made. He then ap- j
pealed to the men to remain together until j
they should reach home. He wished to
take the regiment back to Its own State
i just as it had left a year ago, and he
j asked the men to stay together and not
! to separate at the last moment.
' Then the last piece of work was taken
up. Each company was formed in line
and the mustering officer called the roll ,
| and verified the papers of every man as ;
â¢ be answered to his name. Each man was
j handed his discharge, and then th^ com- j
j pany was marched before the paymaster, j
who closed each man's account and paid ,
him the balance due him. General Sum- .
! mers was the last man in the regiment to |
! receive his pay and his discharge.
There were over 1100 men mustered out,
and they were paid altogether over -i'".-i
' 000, or an average of about $127. Th. men .
! were paid for one month and seven days'
I service since last payday, two months' i
I extra allowed by Congress to every man
i serving outside the country during the
war, a balance due on clothing allowance ;
and travel pay home.
The men are not satisfied with their dis
charges and there is a vigorous compiatnt
taking shape among the better element of
the regiment. Every discharge bears in
the blank for the performance of duty i
the words "honestly and faithfully." No i
distinction has been mad.- between the !
good and the bad. and there is no blank I
for conduct or character as Is In the dis
charge granted to men having the regu- I
lar service. The men of the Oregon regl-. I
ment say there has been nothing to show
who of the regiment have tried to keep
up the reputation of the organization and
have done their best to fit themselves for
their duties. No distinction has been made
between the proficient and the inefficient ]
j and the proficient believe they have the j
I right to have their efforts to make good \
! soldiers of themselves made of record In ;
i their discharges. A number have come <
I together and have drawn up a protest i
| against the single classification of the ;
I men, and this will be prerenied to Gen- j
! eral Summers It is probable that the
â¢ matter will be taken before the Governor
of Oregon and that he will do something
in the matter.
As soon as the first company had gone
through the mustering -"it mill signs of
i departure began to appear on every side. \
| In the vicinity of the post an astute busi- ,
I ness man had laid in a stock of trunks
and upon these the men made an assault. j
His stock was barely sufficient to stand
the sudden drain upon it and before long [
there were trunks all over the camp, al'
In different stages of packing. It was an
nounced to the men that trucks would be â¢
in readiness this morning to cart the bag
gage to the ferry, but the men would not ;
wait. They sent for wagons of their own
and all day loads of trunks and boxes
blocked the' streets leading from the Pre- {
sidio. Lieutenant Knapp, quartermaster
of the regiment, had ordered eight trucks
: to report at the camp this morning, hut
as he saw the amount of baggage grow
ing less and less be countermanded the i
order for eight and made it three. It Is I
hardly probable that even three will be
filled " by what is left. The tents are
empty, the property Is nearly all away,
: and 'he deserted company streets are be
ing patrolled by a guard from the Penn
sylvania regiment.
The men will report out at the Presidio |
1 this morning in time to form In line at 1
o'clock to march to the ferry. It Is op
tional with them, of course, but General
! Summers says he will have a full regi
i ment in line. They will be escorted by the
band of the Nebraska regiment and the
Utah artillerymen. They will have no
arms, but will carry their colors. The
march will be down the streets by which
they reached the Presidioâ down Lombard ;
street to Van Ness avenue, to Golden |
Gate avenue, to Market street and to the ;
ferry. The regiment will march on board I
the Oakland boat at once and on the |
mole it will take the special train wnich i
will be waiting there. Then with a whoop I
and a hurrah the boys will off for Ore
gon. * . ,_

THREE FEDERAL DECISIONS, j
Ninety-Day Clause in Accident In
surance Declared to Be Valid
and Binding.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow de
livered an opinion yesterday in favor of
the defendant in the case of Lucy Pryor
Brown against the United States Casualty
Company. The suit was brought by the
widow of Arthur Page Brown, architect,
to recover $10,000 on two policies of acci
dent insurance for $5000 each.
It was admitted by the defendant that
Brown dltd from the direct result of a
runaway accident on January 21, I_Â«0, 106
days after the accident. The company
paid the widow $"".7 14. being $50 weekly
indemnity from the time of the accident
to the time of Mr. Brown's death, but
refused to pay the death benefits, alleging
as a reason for such refusal the existence
in the policies of a clause providing that
1 death benefits shall be paid only in cases
I where the death occurs within ninety days
after the accident.
Judge Morrow held that the clause was
! valid and that the company was not i
! obliged to pay the death benefit.

MRS. ARATA DROWNED.
The Body of the Demented Woman
Found Floating in the Bay.
Mrs. Louisa Arata of 716 Montgomery
avenue, who left home on July 16 after
repeated threats of suicide, made her word
good, and her disfigured body was found
yesterday morning floating in the bay at
section 1 of the seawall.
Several months ago an Infant son of Mr.
and Mrs. Stephen Arata died of the croup.
The father at the time was In Italy, and
the mother became afflicted with the idea
that on his return to this city he would
blame her for the child's death. She
grieved so much over the matter that her
brain gave way. and at 11 o'clock oil the
night of July 16 she slipped out if the
house unknown to her husband and dis
appeared. The condition of the oody in
dicates that she drowned herself on the
night on which she left home. *_
The remains were taken to the Morgue
and an inquest was held yesterday morn
ing, the jury returning a verdict that Mrs.
Arata had committed suicide while tem
porarily insane.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 7.â To-day's stock market
was largely professional and seemed to move
in response to the closing out of speculative ac
counts rather from any new ventures. A group
of specialties which were lifted last week re
acted sharply on profit-taking, while those that
had been raided by the bears last week tended
toward very. The Tobacco stocks and
Tennessee Coal ,were most acute sufferers on
realizing. American Tobacco fell off 2*. points,
with only a fractional rally, and Tennessee
Coal dropped an extreme 2"4- The Continental
tobacco stocks and securities of companies di

atfecled There was a continued upward move

extreme advance reaching 4'Â«. This stuck be
came feverish in the late trading and i I Â«ed
with a net gain of I*4: The announcement of
the purchase of receivers* certificates by the re
organization committee may have to do with
the strength. Support was manifest in the
Wisconsin Central Issues, and th.- Pittsburg.
C. ,- and St. Louis stock 6 closed I@2 points
higher respectively on the da . There was a
Etrong upward movement in Northern Pacific
from the extreme rise, reaching I*4. This in
duced bear covering in Union Pacific, resulting
in an advance of a point in that stock. The
smelting stocks were very firm, and in the late
dealing's New York Central was lifted *4 on the
good showing of July earnings, while Penn
sylvania moved a point in the opposite direc
tion. Lackawanna and Paper dropped 2. each.
The attitude of speculators was for the most
-.art a waiting one. and there was no severe
pressure to sell, notwithstanding the low state
of reseives shown by Saturday's bank state
ment. Money continued in supply at 4 per cent.
The bank holiday in London left to means of
gauging the money market there, but the ad
\anre from 4*-_ to 5 per cent of German Im
perial banks rates of discount reflected the con
tinued process of drawing in of credits to the
London center. This did not prevent a fall of
a fraction of the rates for sterling exchange In
New York.
There was no sign of acute apprehension over
the money situation in the stock market, but
Interest is keenly centered on the money re
sources of outside domestic centers with a view

<$â ________<â¢*>
CHICAGO, Aug. 7.â The most prominent fea
ture of wheat trading throughout the entire
session was its exceeding dullness. Interest In
trading, never very great during the hot sum- |
mer months, dwindled to insignificant propor- j
tions to-day, and the sum total of the ses
sion's transactions was hardly as goat as has
frequently been seen during a lively half hour.
Variations in the price were confined to a
range of %c in September and but a shade over
that In the more distant futures. September i
opened %c to %c lower at 69% c. Weather in
the spring wheat belt was favorable and this I
caused a little languid selling at first, enough I
to put the price at 69c. The favorable weather j
was In a measure offset by reports of disap- |
pointing yields from various points and by bad
crop reports from European countries. A mod- |
crate covering movement ensued, carrying Sep
tember to 69*-ic. Up to the noon hour the price
kept close to that figure, but after that time
the neglected market developed more weakness,
September getting back to 69c again. This was
"put" price, and several little rallies occurred
on buying against the privileges, but the sup
port was unsubstantial and the market invari
ably worked back to the even figure. The cash
demand was small and New fork reported only
ten boatloads taken for export. Primary re
ceipts continued large, the total being 756,000
bushels. September was bringing 69c at the
close.
Corn was Irregular, with some degree of j
activity.. The market opened weak on the ex- i
oellent" crop conditions and large crop esti
mates. The cash situation was strong, and
September showed a substantial advance at one
time. The new crop features were sold more
liberally, and later in the session September
also weakened, practically all the advanve be-
Ing lost. September closed a shade higher, and
December closed %c to Ur lower.
Oats were neglected. The market was In
fluenced almost entirely by corn. September
closed unchanged.
Provisions were dull, but rather steady. In
view of a break In hog prices, showing weak
ness early; recovered later and closed steady.
The demand for meats was good. Packers were
moderate sellers. At the close September pork
was 2%c lower, lard a shade lower and ribs a
shade higher.

Small Russian shipments were the only encour
aging feature. Later on the market steadied
somewhat unaer Continental bids, as Spain and
Portugal were again buyers, but the rallying
tendency was checked by an increase of 910,000

WON THE PRIZE
For His Composition Upon the Father
of His Country.
Bobby has just reached English compo-
sition in his school, and his father is a
newspaper man, who prides himself on his
concise style. Bobby came home from
school the "other day in high glee because
his teacher had praised his composition)
on George Washington. He showed the
production to his father with pride, but
was somewhat crestfallen at his parent's
criticism: Â '..._-; Â«â  â¢
â¢â¢Too many words, my son. Too many
words altogether. Why can't your teach-
ers instruct you how to express your
ideas tersely? Now, just sit down at that
table, take this pencil, cut out every word
you can spare without leaving out a single
idea, and if your mother does not agree
with me that the result is better than this
composition which your teacher praises,
I'll give you half a dollar."
The lad took the pencil and fell to work
while his father read the paper. After a
lung time Bobby brought the heavily
scored manuscript to him, saying:
"It was hard work to keep In something
on every one of the things Washington is
famous for, dad. but I guess I did it.
This is how the result read:
"George Washington became the father
of his country because he had no little
boy of his own to whip for cutting down
cherry trees, .and he is remarkable among
American statesmen because he would
not tell a lie."

TOOK TWO METHODS
OF ENDING HIS LIFE
OAKLAND, Aug. John Curley passed
his â¢her ln the back yard of their home
this morning without speaking, and went
into the house. A moment later a shot was
heard, and the father, on opening the
door, saw his son lying dead on a sofa.
John Curley was a teamster about 30
years â â¢Id living at Forty-sixth and Grove
streets. He did not return home last
night, but about noon to-day he appeared
at the house. He said nothing to any
body, but calmly walked through* the
yard into the house and committed sui
cide by firing a bullet Into his brain.
Short as was the time between leaving
his father and sister, who was also In
the house, and the firing of the shot.
Curley made two attempts to end his
life. As soon as he went Into the room
he made two severe cuts on his throat
â¢with a razor and a few seconds later used
his pistol. An nation of the body
showed that the gashes would have been
fatal, had they not received immediate
attention, but bleeding to death was evi
dently too tedious for Curley.
The deceased's father says that his son
has not seemed to be possessed of his
ordinary good sense for several weeks.
When he passed him In the yard his son
held up his coat with one hand as though
he were anxious not to pee his father.
Some years ago John Curley had trouble
with a man named Leggett, and shot the
latter in self-defense.
BLIND PEOPLE MARRY,
NOW APPEAL FOR AID
OAKLAND, Aug. 7.â Mrs. Mary J. Libb.
a blind young woman, appeared before
the Supervisors to-day as an indigent.
From her testimony it appeared that she
was formerly an Inmate of the Home for
the Adult Blind and that she had some
time ago married a man also blind. Nei
ther of them had been able to secure em
ployment, and to relieve them from a life
of squalor in a ramshackle hut at Thirty
sixth and Grove streets she pleaded for
aid. -'-"--
Among the other applicants for aid as
Indigents was R. F. Fallmer of '.*".*"' Union
street, Alameda. He Is the father of
Clara Fallmer, who shot and killed her
lover in Alameda xifcarly^wo years ago
and was afterward acquitted at great cost
to the county. Besides this daughter he
has five other children depending upon
him for support.
Both cases were referred to the Super
visors of the respective districts.
SHE BEGGED FOR NICKELS;
OWNED THREE HOUSES
Oakland office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 7.
Mrs. Margaret Olvis, the aged woman
who was arrested by Officer Woods last
Saturday night because she was found
begging on the streets, and on whom,
when searched, was found an old black
glove containing $14 55, pleaded guilty to
day in the Police art, and Judge Smith
sentenced her to three months' imprison
ment in the County Jail.
It developed in court when she was ar
raigned that she had insulted several
women on Washington street. Asked why
she had done this, Mrs. Olvis replied that
they "had refused to help her."
Mrs. Olvis is GO years of age. and has
been a familiar figure on tho streets. She
is a plump little woman and a perfect
actress when It comes to affecting a de
crepit condition. But when she is refused
alms she casts aside her disguise and
abuses in vile terms those who thus of
fend her. It is no secret that she pays
taxes on at least $300. worth of property,
being the owner of three cozy cottages on
Seventeenth street, from which she gains
a fair revenue; but all this she vigorously
denies, and says it is a shame teat the
widow of a Mexican war veteran should be
Incarcerated in a prison with disreputable
characters and criminals.
"Oh, I once had money," she frankly
confessed when questioned at the County
Jail this afternoon, "but it's all gone now.
aid the $14 they found on me was Just a
little thai was left over. I made my
money at cooking. .'';.:.
"No. 1 have no one to help me. I did
have a husband, Daniel Olvis. He was a
veteran of the Mexican war, but several
years ago. after 1 hadn't heard from him
for nearly a whole year, 1 received a tele
gram announcing that he had died at
X*kiah. I went there, but never found a
grave, and for all i know he has probably
married another woman."
MORE ARCHITECTURAL
PLANS HAVE ARRIVEI
BERKELEY, Aug. 7.â Late this after
noon the secretary of the Board of '*â¢
gents of the University of California re
ceived a consignment of drawings for the
Phebe Hearst international architectural
competition, which is to be decided in
Berkeley shortly. To-day's consignment
was the second of the ten which are
due to arrive here before the end of the
present month.
The plans were forwarded by the firm
of Whitney Warren and Charles D. Wet
more, architects of New York city. They
had a valuation of $1000. Judging from
the K lze of the packing case In which
they were shipped the drawing must be
of the most extensive and elaborate kind,
as the case completely filled the express
wagon which hauled it from the South
ern Pacific depot on ttuck avenue to
South Hall upon the university campus.
Acting Secretary James M wen took
charge of the Immense designs and had
them stored In the basement of South
Hall along with those already forwarded
by Philip Codman of Boston.
It is expected that the remaining eight
of the plans yet to arrive will be here
shortly, as the competition closes by the
end of August. As soon as possible after
that date the hoard of judges selected for
the important duty of choosing the
gigantic plans for the future University
0-~Californla will convene at Berkeley to
inspect the designs and make their de
cision.

ELEVEN LAWYERS
AND AN EX-WIFE
CHASING HIM
Surprise in Freeman
Divorce Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 7.
"I will never be able to pay any alimo
ny with eleven lawyers and this woman
behind me chasing me all. day long. I have
told Mrs. Freeman several times that
whenever she draws down the lawyers
| and lets me alone long enough to get a
start in business I will do what I can for
; her."
The speaker was Thomas Freeman, a
: carriage painter, in the employ of W. B.
Woodward, who had been -ited to appear
before Judge Ogden this afternoon to
show cause, if any he had, why he should
not be punished for contempt of court in
having failed and refused to pay his di
vorced wife, Sarah Freeman, $20 monthly
alimony until there was $320 due.
Mrs. Freeman was granted her divorce
by Judge Greene in January, 1*.95, on the
ground of infidelity and ever since then
Â«he hag had any amount of difficulty to
collect the alimony. On the witness stand
to-day the ex-wife testified that her for
mer husband hau been working every day
and that he surely must be able to con
tribute the small amount of $20 as de
creed for her support and maintenance.
Mrs. Freeman was formerly Mrs. Barnes
and she was also Freeman's second wife.
He has one son by his first wife and she
has two daughters by her first husband.
"Were It not for my two children," said
Mrs. Freeman to-day, "I would be com- :
pelled to go Into the streets for charity."
On cross-examination Attorney Frick
sprung a decided and rather sensational
surprise. He asked Mrs. Freeman to give
the date and place of her marriage to
Freeman and to this question her attor
ney J. E. McElroy, made serious objec
tions, 'but Attorney Prick explained to
the court that he intended bringing out
facts on which his client proposed to base
an action for the modification of the de
cree, intimating that the parties were
never legally married. Mrs. Freeman was
allowed to answer. She â¢J'ld that the
marriage was solemnized at San Diego In
September, 18S7.
The defendant was also called as a wit
ness to show that he had not earned
enough to meet the demand for alimony.
He paid he had earned but WOO the past
six months; that out of this he paid for
clothes, medicine, room rent, tools, etc..
about $-"--' When asked what had become
of the balance, $7*. he facetiously replied
that he "had eaten that." -ytf'"' _:'â¢.
Continuing, witness testified that at the
divorce trial he had shown that for
months he was compelled to go almost
naked and lived on $27 per month, but
Judge Ogden here Interrupted and repri
manded him. , _ _ â¢â 
â¢â if you barely lived on $27 per month,
queried his Honor, "how do you suppose
Mrs. Freeman could live on nothing?
You know you were at fault. She was
given a decree on the ground that you
had violated the marriage vow. You seem
to have kept yourself t pretty well, but
not so with your wife."
On cross-examination Freeman admitted
that at one time he had told Deptuy Dis
trict Attorney Melvin that if the wife
would 'iron the divorce suit he would
gladly give her one-half of his earnings.
This, however, she had refused, and the
offer was not repeated to-day.
Owing to the absence of an important
witness further hearing went over until
next Monday, by which time interesting
developments might be expected.
HOSPITAL OPENS TO-MORROW.
I The Board of Health announced yester
day that the Central Receiving Hospital
would be open again on Wednesday morn
i ing. The plumbing which was begun last
week will be completed to-night and the
building will be In sanitary condition.
'â  Only the repainting will remain to be fin
ished but as that is to be done ward by
ward there will be no inconvenience.
REMORSE CAUSED HIS ACT.
Richard Koch, one of the proprietors of |
the Sutter saloon at Market and Sutter
streets committed suicide by turning on
the gas in a room at 43 Hardy street yes
terday afternoon. The cause of his act
was trouble which he recently had with
his wife. â , _ _ tf.
Koch was about 30 years of age and had
been married five years. He frequently
abused bis wife and was arrested for
wife-beating about a month ago. After
his release domestic infelicity began anew
and three days ago Mrs. Koch left her
husband and home. Koch brooded some
what over the matter, and retired yester
day to his room, where he took his life.
The odor of gas was first detected by E.
T M. Lai?., who occupies the flat imme
diately above the one utilized by the Koch
family. McLain attempted to ascertain
whether there was any one in tip* house,
and receiving no response notified the
police. An officer smashed in the door and
repairing to a back room found Koch
stretched out on the bed, lifeless. The gas
had been escaping for some time.
Deputy Coroners La Combe and Flan
nigan were called and took the body to
the Morgue. The wife could not be found
last night. Koch was a prominent Ger
man and was associated with Theodore
Relnke in the saloon business.
REILLY HAD A FIT.
The Convicted Soldier Creates a Scene
in the City Prison.
John Reilly. a soldier who Is confined
in the City Prison, created considerable
consternation among his cellmates last
evening by screaming at the top of his
voice and otherwise acting like an insane
man. Sergeant Brown, thinking that he
had been suddenly bereft of his reason,
ordered him removed to the insane ward
of the Receiving Hospital. The superin
i tendent of the Institution refused to re
ceive him as he concluded that Reilly
! was shamming. Reilly was then returned
-, to the prison and locked up. Shortly
afterward he recovered his reason and
i explained that he had had a fit.
Illy was arrested Saturday night for
'â â  soliciting alms from pedestrians on Mar-
I ket street and was yesterday convicted

MILITARY DRAMA
AND A PATHETIC
CENTRAL FIGURE
Brother Officers'" Is
a Success.
Trevor's London success, "Brother Of- I
ficers," was last night offered to a San j
Francisco audience by Henry Miller and !
his company at the Columbia and ac- j
cepted with applause and many curtain j
calls. To those who have eyes and will
see the pathetic heart story of "Brother j
Officers" is laid bare in the first act. \
Lieutenant John Hinds, a great-hearted,
strong-souled fellow, a diamond in the i
rough, sprung from the gutter, but with
"the feelins" of a gentleman, having
passed with distinction through the ranks
to a commission, Is suddenly set down in
the midst of swelldom in the persons of
the First Lancers and Its guests, whose :
ancestors, to a man, we are made to feel, I
bequeathed them the priceless legacy of j
an aristocratic name.
The feeling that he has, up to this, ;
missed the best companionship, is evoked
in sudden agony, as he touches, for the
first time, the hand of a beautiful, cul- â 
tured woman; Lady Roydon. He has i
been distinguished for great bravery in
the ranks, has, by daring courage, saved ;
the life of his "brother officer," Lieuten
ant Launcelot Pleydell; he has the soul
of a hero and the discipline of his com
panionship Is to make men of more than I
one of his comrades. Yet there he stands, .
a most pathetic figure, restless, 111 at
ease feeling his shortcomings, not know
ing 'his worth, telling Launcelot, when
they are alone, that he wants to be
taught manners In order-dressing, talk
ing eating, smoking and the rest. It s
a matter ot breed," he says, "we come
from different stables." And Launcelot
promises to lick him Into shape. In ,
obedience to the hitter's advice to be ;
genial and easy with the officers of the
mesa lords and all, he goes through his j
whole repertory of manners, and In try- ,
ing to do Justice to the occasion makes)
the awful mistake of asking "his dean- .
ship," "his holiness." what he would say
to a "peg," "something small,' a whisky
and soda, and drinks "success to the :
church and confusion to heretics! The ,
comedy of the situation makes a big
laugh, but the pathos of it make- the
collar tight. And the laugh Increases
with every false move until, in the midst I
of his trying hospitably to Persuade
champagne upon the ladies the old colonel ,
appears upon the scene and in hard, un- |
shaded fashion rebukes his lack of man
ners before them all-poor fellow, when
he meant so well. Then the laugh ceases
Lady Roydon, whose slightest wisfr is
law saves" the situation and proves her
right to a title by suddenly becoming
thirst y and asking them all to join her
in a toast, saying: "I drink to a brave
gentleman and his better acquaintance
The glasses are raised, the toast is drunk
-a pause-then once more Lieutenant
Hinds touches her hand, this time In (
gratitude, with his lips. Curtain.
Lady Roydon loves her cousin, Launce
lot*. she has told us so In look and tone, ;
and so we have the story. John s chances
of happiness are forever lost In a pressure
of the lips. In two more acts he becomes
a gentleman, of Launcelot- ma king, and
save* the boy from disgrace and discharge
by discovering in one Hutton, **Â»?,. is
Dressing for the payment of ---ambling ,
debts a thief and a blackguard who has
fobbed hi (Hinds') father of fortune and
honor, and from whom a word will send |
the fellow to penal servitude and oblivion.
Hinds has one weak moment, â¢when his
love for Lady Roydon prompts him to
withdraw his help and let Laum go o
the devil, that he may fill his place; but
his better nature quickly takes shape by
pressure from without, and he gives up,
knowing, as we all do, that it is be* so.
for, somehow, though he Is good enough.
we know that he could never make Lady
Roydon happy. "There are two classes of
men " he repeats, "gentlemen and the
rest." I fall in with the rest."
Launcelot. a worthless sort of fellow |
through false education, wins her hand
and because of love she will probably be
happy Hinds, nature's nobleman, loses
her and because of love all his happiness
is dead. So the world wags. The first act
is best in dialogue and situation, the sec
ond 'n serious interest and the third in
scene The sen. ml is too slow and made
somewhat slower than necessary by what
the elocutionist calls "too long quantity,
but it has a clever drop and win- two
call-* Hinds, Lady Roydon, Launcelot
and Hutton are four well drawn charac
ters and really make the play. After
seeing Mr. Miller as John Hinds we won
der -.â ;-â _ is -a dramatic problem he is I
not capable of grappling with and mas
tering ' His individuality becomes a plas- ,
tic, obedient, unreasoning quality and
disappears under his make-up. which is ;
the most natural, and, best of all, not ex- ;
S _me a say's so many pleasant things of
Miss Anglin that the collection of adjec
tives at one's command is about ex
hausted. As Lady Roydon she is just
herself and what more can be said in
uraise? Mr. Standing gets our blessing
when he wins her, in spite of our con
viction that he doesn't deserve her, be
cause Mr. Standing digs down in the
character and shows us the spots where
its graces lie. Mr. Stevens ln the third
act wins a well-deserved scene call, and
although scene calls are bad and â¢should
not be encouraged. I clapped myself. The
Dar are generally divided, for even the #
garnishing in the way of lovers, mothers
and devoted gallants is good garnishing.
Miss Dale has one fine speech and makes
a hit with it. and Mrs Whiff en as
1 auncelot's mother, with her superfluous
and misplaced adjectives, and her pen
chant for matchmaking, is a most amus
ing figure. Mr. Allen in the small port of
the curate does good work, and the
minor support is most satisfactory.
The plot of the play is not exceeding
novel, but it is well worked out. The
finale curtain rings down on Hinds step
' ping easily out of a wide door (doors that
: lead to desolation are always wide) on
his way to India. But what matters the
place? The backward look he gives upon
the happiness he is leaving shows us but
too leariy that al! places will for the
future be the same to him. And the birds
Â«ing because the sun is rising!
8 CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
California.
It reeds only the announcement that
"The Fairy Godmother" la based upon a
French subject by the elder Dumas to
warrant the expectation that the new I
comedy is sprightly, interesting, witty j
and probable, and it needs only the state
ment that Blanche Bates, Manola Mould,
T Daniel Frawley and Alfred Hickman
were in the leading roles to convince the
reader that the brand new comedy at the i
California last night was a success. The
production is of the light French order !
and 1}.,. Btory must have been written by i
the incomparable Dumas pere when he j
was m the champagne and cigar mood.
It is bright, sparkling, consistent and en- j
joyable. -â â ; tftf . _ _
The play could not have been put upon
the stage in better form. Miss Bates.
Miss Mould and Miss Van Buren ap- ;
peared in stunning toilets and Frawley
and Hickman In court attire. When the
curtain rose upon the third act there was
a spontaneous burst of applause for the
beautiful stage setting, representing the
palace gardens in Madrid.
The motive of the play Is norn of love
and Jealousy and the story is simply told.
Miss Bates Is at her best as Mile. Yvonne ,
Mau<dair and Miss Mould as Charlotte de I
Merian presents a charming and artistic
bit of acting. T. Daniel Frawiey was ex
ceptionally pleasing In the congenial role
of Hercule Dubouloy and the audience
gave him an ovation that was abundantly j
merited. .
Orpheum.
The changes in the programme at the
Orpheum last night made a great im
provement in the entertainment and .in
consequence the large audience was high
ly phased. Some of the old stars con
tinued their successes of last week and
the new ores established themselves as
favorites. The Denozo brothers in their
trick barrel jumping act are particularly i
clever. They accomplish some surprising i
feats, in which they jump into barrels,
on tables and finally land side by Â»ide
in a barrel which rests on a table. Harry '
Linton and Leila Mclntyre, in "A Doc- i
tor's Patient," were amusing, as were also j
"Bob" Alden and "Strap Hill in a real
ragtime coon specialty. Alden is also i
master at producing ragtime music on the
piano. Alexandra Dagmar in her. interna
tional songs created a very favorable im
pression. She has a clear, flexible voice
| and uses it to good advantage. The Amer
â  - â  â¢-" . ' I
lean biograph was well received. The J
Pennsylvania boys marching In review
made a particularly fine scene. â  ,-
Tivoli. .' '
The popularity of "II Trovatore," as (
well as the Tivoli Grand Opera Company,
seems to have gained pretty large dini-i'
sions. if one may judge from the crowded
house and the enthusiasm last evening. ;
The honors of the performance must be
accorded to Mary Linck, who played and
sang Azuc.na with a vim and dash that
needs must' earn her the admiration or
her audience. Of course Avadena and
Salassa. as usual, captured the house
with, their inimitable vocal art. and cur- i
tain calls appeared to be the rule or tne .
evening. Miss Anna Lichter. too, as Leo- -
nora, added to her reputation as a vocal
ist of more than ordinary merit. The en- .
semble work was fully, worthy of the gen
erous approval awarded it. Inasmuch
as the audience bestowed ovation upon ;
ovation It Is needless to go Into any da
tailed criticism. Orchestra and chorus .
deserve to be particularly encouraged. '
This evening "Faust" will be presented.
Miss Prossnltz being afflicted with a gen- ,
': nine California cold, it was necessary to :
i make a few changes in the casts. Thus â¢
Madame de Pasquali, who recently
! achieved such a remarkable success here
' in fragments of various grand operas. â¢
> has been secured for Marguerite, in which i
' role she Is exceptionally brilliant. Ber- ;
'â  thald. whose Faust was always admired,
will assume that responsible role, while
Mr. Wanrell will essay the part. of Me
phisto. If one may judge from the cast
the performance this evening will be an
exceptional one. ALFRED METZGER.
Grand Opera House.
Pretty scenery and costumes, laughable
i situations, good music and several very
! attractive duets is a fair summary of the
comic opera "Falka," which was put on
| for the first time at the Grand Opera
House last evening. Edith Mason as
Falka won much applause for her capti
: vating voice and acting. Hattie Belle
Ladd as Edwlge and Wlnfred Goff as
Boleslas were recalled several times in
: the duet.
.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar was crowded last night,
: when "The Lady of Lyons," with its old
j romantic love story, was presented. It
I was magnificently staged and well re
ceived. Miss Florence Roberts' Pauline
', will rank among the best that has been
'seen- in this city, her portrayal of the
character being admirable. White AN hlt
: tlesey can claim distinction as being a
, manly and winning stage lover and his
Claude Melnotte was one of the best ef
! forts. In the cottage scene he and Miss
j Roberts wore seven times called before
the curtain. In marked contrast to the
hero was the villain Beauseant, repre
sented by Frank Denithorne, who did not
! fit his part. Clarence Montaine as Colo
! rel Damas was the bluff old soldier to
i the life. Miss Marie Howe was rather
i too boisterous as Madame Deschapelles.
I Mrs. George Watson as Widow Melnotte
' was quite delightful.
Chutes.
The musical act offered by Kate and
\ Charles Willard at the Chutes Theater
last night proved a successful novelty.
They play upon such unique instruments
as a "Japanese bamboo calliope," the
"English musical whirls." the "Swiss
I Trinity bells," the "American aluminum
chimes" and the "Guatemala mammoth
hone." Pat Kelly, as Irish in action
; as his name is in print, told a lot of new
stories and sang some old songs. He made.
' a hit. Frank and Celia Morris, a strong
i man and woman, did most extraordinary
feats in the way of holding each other ly
their teeth, carrying four and five met.
on their shoulders and breaking chains.
Olympia.
Tod Sloan's sister is the main attraction
j at the Olympia for this week. Her brother
j objects to her appearance in public, and
' out of respect for the little jockey's feel-
I Ings she calls herself Blanche Sloan St.
j Clalr. She is clever and her work with
i the riving rings Is daring as any of the
! now famous Tod's rides. The other at
! tractions are all good. I
SOLDIERS IN CAMP

i sidio last evening at retreat. The review
took place on that, part of the old parade

General Longstreet. In the meantime the j
I Pennsylvania men had held dress parade
j on the color line of the camp and they
i were marched out after the Nebraska men

showing and General Longstreet express
led much pleasure at the honor that had

Permission has been received from

custom and the intention to keep these 1
men until their regiments had returned
and then to muster them out with their
comrades, but the men look upon this as ;
a hardship and they wish to get out as
soon as they are able. General Shatter

POLITICS AT WORK IN
THE OLYMPIC CLUB
TWO NOMINATING TICKETS ARE
IN THE FIELD.
For the first time In three years politics
within the Olympic Club manifested itself
in a factional strife. At the annual elec
tion of the nominating committee last
night two tickets were placed In the Held.
Vice President McLellan presided and a
quorum of 100 members was present. The
meeting was held In the club gymnasium,
and to the surprise of the old clubmen
evolved into a political fight. There was
much discussion over the manner In which
the ticket should be voted. Some were in
favor of a composite vote on a straight
ticket others preferred a ballot for indi
viduals The former wop. out after a
lengthy debate on parliamentary laws.
The "Work of the evening began when
A M. Armstrong rose to nominate what
he termed representatives of the minor
ity He said he represented a bulk of
club' members who used the cluo daily,
and they wanted representation. Other
wise there would be discord and discon
tent. At first Armstrong was in mind to
nominate two men, but later changed to
the naming of five. Leo Pockwitz led the
opposition and he named five. Arm
strong's ticket was Frank W. Pearson,
William Cartwrlght. Al Hoffman, Roy
Welden and John Tait. Pockwitz nom
inated Tom Sawyer. Ed Zimmer. H. S.
Russ, Herman Heydenfeldt and T. C. Har
dee. Pockwitz's ticket won out handily,
as the "boss" politician had marshaled
his forces and voted them in a lump.

LUMBERMEN DISCUSS
FOREST CONDITIONS
GUILBERT PINCHOT TALKS ON
, CALIFORNIA TREES.
Meeting in the Chamber of Commerce
Brings About an Exchange of
Ideas on Forest Preserves. "
A number of prominent lumbermen and
those interested in systematic forestry as
sembled yesterday afternoon in the hall
â  of the Chamber of Commerce to discuss
: forestry conditions in the State of Cali
-1 fornia. Hugh Craig presided. Guilbert
I Pinchot, United States Commissioner of
| Forestry, was present and spoke at some
i length about the arboreal investigations
in this and other States. -:- v > '
"The lumbermen throughout the United
States ought to be interested in the con
servation of our big forests," said Mr.
Pinchot. "The private ownership of for
est lands far exceeds the national pre
serves, and the lumbermen ought to use
a wary eye for the conservation of this
I source" of supply. I suggest to you gen
j tlemen present that a thorough study of
conditions as they are in this State be
' made systematically. It would be of great
advantage to know what districts will
produce the best of certain kinds of trees
and what the commercial distribution of
trees is. It would also be wise to study
the effect of chaparral growth upon the
bigger trees and to ascertain what land
is alone fitted for timber purposes "
After Commissioner Pinchot finished his
address a general discussion was had late
in the afternoon.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Suits for divorce on the ground of deser
tion have been filed by Mary E. Hock

COUNTY CLERK WILL
KEEP PRESENT FORCE I
DEPUTIES DEVISE THE WAYS
AND MEANS THEREFOR.
Although the Board of Supervisors
Refused the Requested Relief
the Public Will Not
Suffer.
As the Supervisors have refused to al
low County Clerk Deane a further allow
ance that official and his force of depu
ties have arranged matters so that not
withstanding the effort, on the part of
Mayor Phelan and others to cut the force
to thirty-four men the public will not
suffer. Several weeks ago, when the
Supervisors made the appropriation for
the expenses of the County Clerk's office,
an investigation was made by Mr. Deane
and it was found that it was absolutely
impossible to run the office on the
Mayor's figures. Acting Chief . Deputy
Goddard went before the board and ex
plained the situation. He showed the
board that litigation would be impeded,
estates in course of ' settlement tied up
and perhaps criminals freed If the force
of the office was reduced to inefficient
numbers.
The argument, however, had no effect
on the board and the appropriation was
allowed to stand as first fixed. In con
sequence Mr. Deane, appreciating the
damage which would result to litigants
and the public in general If the Mayor s
wishes were carried out, began to devise
ways and means by which the force or
the offlce could be kept up and the ex
penses still run within the appropriation.
In the meantime the many deputies of the
office, each knowing that the action of
the board meant that some twenty men
would be dropped from the roll if some
plan was not devised, held an informal
meeting and decided that if County Clerk
Deane would keep the present force they
would see that the amount allowed
monthly for salaries was so divided that
each man would get his share of the
whole, the Importance of the offices and
salary heretofore drawn by each man be^
ing considered in the division.
This matter arranged. County Clerk
Deane was called into consultation. Al
though regretting that the board could
not be convinced that an extra appro
priation was needed that the efficiency of
the force might be kept up, and feeling
that the division of the various salaries
was to some extent a sacrifice on the
part of many of the deputies, Mr. Deane
said that in his opinion the public good
was first to be considered, lf the men
had all agreed to the plan as stated, he
said that he had no objection, and that
their agreement had lifted from his
shoulders the further burden of devising
ways by which litigation could be con
tinued without interruption. In conse
quence the force, through the efforts of
Mr. Deane and those under him, will re
main in Its present efficient condition.
Speaking of the situation, Mr. Deane
said last evening that the action of the
board had embarrassed him to some ex
tent, but did not discourage him. He was
confident that although Mayor Phelan
and those who stood by the reduction
measure did not understand the situation
and refused him the needed relief, some
way would be devised by which the public
needs would be attended to. The action
of the County Clerk and his subordinates
caused general satisfaction among the
members of the bar, for the public has
been saved great inconvenience if not
loss, notwithstanding the adverse stand
taken by those who, behind the mask they
hold bearing the slogan "for the public
good," perform official acts to the public
damage.

KIDNAPING OF AH MOY.
The Preliminary Examination of
Wong You Commenced Before
Judge Treadwell.
The preliminary examination of Wong
You, charged with the kidnaping of
pretty Ah Moy some weeks ago from
Chinatown, was commenced before Judge
Tread well yesterday.
John J. Kerrigan, the hackman, who
was arrested along with Wong You, had
the charge against him withdrawn on the
understanding that he would be a wit
ness for the prosecution against Wong
You, -hut after he got on the stand he
showed a reluctance In telling what he
knew. He related how Wong You had
hired his hack and that he drove him and
two other Chinese and the woman to
Holy Cross Cemetery, where they left
the "hack, one of the Chinese carrying the
woman on his back.
Policeman Herve testified to arresting
Kerrigan and the defendant at Ocean
View while driving back t.i the city. The
ease was continued until Thursday. The
police have as yet been unable to dis
cover the whereabouts of Ah Moy.

ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.
Charge of Murder Against John P.
Wilson Dismissed by Judge
Mogan.
The case of John P. "Wilson, charged
with th. murder of Walter Cavanaugh in
a saloon on Ellis and Mason streets a
week ago, was dismissed by Judge Mogan
yesterday on the ground that Wilson act
ed in self-defense.
The Judge reviewed the evidence care
fully and said that from the evidence of
the witnesses for the prosecution it was
apparent that Cavanaugh had determined
to kill Wilson, and if Wilson had not pro
tected himself he certainly would have
been killed. Wilson did not seek Cava
naugh, but Cavanaugh sought him with
murder in his heart.

POLITICAL LEGIONS IN

Resort to Violent Methods.

cratic Ruffians at the Polls.
T "JT TORKERS attached to the va-
WORKERS attached to the va
rious political organizations

fi if the primary election were
actively engaged In their re
spective districts last evening in mak
ing ready for the battle to-day. Esti
mates of the number of votes that \v*"l
be thro wni to-day cover a. wide ranee.
Men who fancy that the interest will
hot be widespread predict that not
more than 25,000 men will vote. others
who have given the campaign close at
tention estimate that 40.000 ballots will
1
be cast. .
There were scenes of activity at â¢all
the political headquarters last night-
The energy displayed at the headquar
ters of the Buckley faction of Demo
crats and the number of workers there
assembled indicate to neutral observ
ers that the old boss will capture a big
section of the Democratic nominating
convention. The Buckleyites do not
underrate the strength of the Rainey-
Examiner League, as many of them
know from experience the force that
the Fire Department organized as a po
litical machine can exert at the polls.
It is known that tickets and instruc
tions have been given to the firemen.
The Instructions convey the idea that
if they lose the election they may lose
their positions. There is an apprehen
sion that the firemen have been ad
vised by implication to use violent
methods If violence shall be necessary
to their success. The Chief of Police
has been notified of the instructions se
cretly given at the various engine
houses Rainey and the Examiner are
desperate and will; not stop short of
sandbagging Innocent citizens in order
to execute their political designs. The
Examiner's work is so raw and clumsy
that Phelan's friend, the Bulletin, is
obliged to protest in this fashion:
"One of the most diabolical features
of this campaign is the attempt that is
being made by Sam Rainey to win by
the use of the Fire Department. This
branch of the city government is be
ing employed without the slightest at
tempt at concealment to carry the
Rainey ticket through. This makes the
stable boss more formidable than his
old ally Buckley. The party organ of
the Democrats has helped to expose
Buckley, but seems to be satisfied with
the Rainey ticket.
"It has denounced the blind man ln
unmeasured terms, but has left Rainey
untouched. This leaves the Bulletin to
fight the battle against Rainey alone.
The public is, therefore, specially
warned against his fakes and informed
of the manner in which he is using the
Fire Department to accomplish his
ends. Members of the department
have heen given leave of absence in or
der that they may do work around the
pools on election day. They have been
ordered to 'get out and work.' and
have been given to understand that
their bread and butter depends upon
compliance with instructions of the
boss. Men have been told that unless
they work for the Rainey ticket they
will lose their places In the department,
and Captain Foley has been promising
the men in the Forty-fifth District
places if they support the Rainey tick
et. This ought in itself to make every
honest man redouble his efforts to ex
clude Rainey from the convention."
So far as can be ascertained, Mayor
Phelan. the executive officer of the city, j
has not uttered an official protest !
against the unwarranted perversion of i
the Fire Department. Yet the Bulle- i
tin, the Mayor's subsidized guardian
and the protect of his political estate,
bluntly characterizes the Fire Depart
ment interference as "one of the most
diabolical features of the campaign."
In the Republican ranks there is
sharp rivalry between the followers of j
the County Committee on one side and
the supporters of the Grand Hotel ticket
on the other. The Republican conven
tion must of necessity be better than
the one which the Democrats will
choose, because the most inferior ma
terial on the Republican ticket is bet- j
ter than the best put forward by Demo- ;
cratic factions. The fight in the Demo
cratic party in so bitter, and withal so
alluring to the political heeler, that the
touts and ruffians who recently trained
under the Republican banner will get

the ordinary illnesses of childhood?
Any woman may insure the health of her
children who will take proper care of her
health in a womanly way. The health of
her children depends almost entirely upon
her general health, and particularly upon
the health and strength of the delicate and
important organs '.hat bear the burdens of
maternity. A woman has no right to dis-
regard her own health, comfort, ease and
happiness, she certainly has less right to
condemn her children to a life of suffering
or an early death. That is what she does
if she neglects the health of her special
womanly organism. Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription is an unfailing remedy for all
disorders of this description. It strength-
ens and invigorates the sensitive orgaus
concerned, and is the best preparation for
the trials and dangers of maternity. It in-
sures the well being of the mother and the
health of the child. Its use is a guarantee
of a bountiful supply of nourishment for
the little new-comer. Many women who
once bore children only to speedily lose
them, are now mothers of healthy, robust
children as the result of the use of this
medicine.
Darbra A. Mudd. of Indian Creek, Mo., writes:
"I am very thankful for what Dr. Pierces Fa-
vorite Prescription did for me. I was all broken
down fro-.u nervous prostration, but since taking
your medicine I have had more relief than
(rom all the doctors. Your ' Favorite Prescrip-
tion ' did me a world of good."
Many women have told their experiences,
and given their names, addresses and pho-
tographs in Dr. Pierces Common Sense
Medical Adviser. " This book is free. A
copy will be sent to any address upon re-
ceipt of 21 one-cent stamps to cover cost of

Into the Democratic party for service
at the polls to-day. For this reason the
Republican vote may fall short of pre
vious expectation. The Republicans
are, however, assured that the party

'.rf San Francisco.
Senator Sammie Braunhart has quit.
Early last evening he took a final look
at the perplexing situation, and in ring
parlance threw up the sponge and ad
mitted to several of his opposing Demo
crats that his chances at the primary
to-day would be too slim to warrant a
show of what little strength he had.
Before he visited the railroad head
quarters Sammie felt sure that he
could pull the Committee of One Hun
dred of the Democracy through in the
THE RAINEY-EXAMINER ROUND-UP.
Twenty-ninth District, but when the in
terview was over the Senator found that
the support he looked for had already
been given to the Examiner-Rainey
combination, and Sammie was told that
he must shift for himself and incident
ally the Committee of One Hundred. Be
fore leaving the office, however, he was
handed a small book, entitled, "How to
interview a railroad political boss with
out the knowledge of a newspaper."
A queer state of affairs exists in the
camp of the Committee of One Hun
dred of the Democracy in the Fortieth
District.
M. C. Hassett had his eye on the lead
ership of that district. Ed Rock in his
desire to get to. the front told his many
friends that he also could handle the
lines In good shape. When Hassett
learned of Rock's ambition he hastened
to him and tried, to explain to Rock that
he (Hassett) would better satisfy the
district as Its leader. Mr. Rock could
not see it that way, and in order to
settle the matter Rock suggested that
both call a meeting and the one show
ing the larger roll of legitimate voters
would assume the leadership. Hassett
consented to the plan and meetings
were called, and Rock, it is said, won
according to the agreement.
Hassett was not satisfied with the re
sult and repaired forthwith to head
quarters with his grievance. The Com
mittee of One Hundred tried to smooth
the matter over by coaxing Rock to
step down, but Mr. Rock was firm and
no amount of pleading could move him.
At last reports the committee had
failed to patch up the difficulty, and
both aspirants for leadership honors
have agreed to fight it out to a finish at
the polls to-day.
Rainey and the Examiner In the For
tieth are anxious to Join forces with the
Committee of One Hundred of the
Democracy represented by M. C. Has
sett in that district and are offering and
suggesting all sorts of compromises
and combinations in order to squeeze In.
Hassett does not take very kindly to 'â 
! the idea and declares that he would j
I rather have his wing of the Democratic 'â¢â 
party defeated in an honest, open fight
! than to win a few delegates and have
the stain of Examiner- Raineyism on ;
j them.
BUCKLEY HEADQUARTERS
I The Blind Man's Followers
Propose to Shape the Des
tiny of the Democracy.
All was activity in the headquarters of ;
! Buckley last night. The rooms were |
; crowded with scores of young men, over
j half of whom had the general appearance
of having worked hard during the day at
their respective trades. The topic of dis
cussion was the primary election and the I
chances of the tickets in the various As
sembly districts to-day. .
The trend of the conversation often led ;
to the part the Examiner had taken In ,
the fight and the onslaught it has made :
on Buckley and the men who support him.
It seemed to be the universal opinion |
i among tho workingmen who compose the !
I different clubs that the harsh things said j
j of Buckley's followers are intended for
! them, and they therefore are indignant.
While Buckley does not hold Phelan re- !
j sponsible for the reviling he and his \
{friend* have received in the columns of j
THE SAN, AX CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 1899.
the Examiner, his followers do. The fol
lowers of Mr. Buckley are determined to
continue their organizations whether they
be successful at the polls to-day or not.
They number many thousands and feel
they can wield some influence in shaping
the destiny of their party. .
In a general conversation Buckley re
gretted that the members of the Fire De
partment were compelled to get out and
work hard for the success of Ralney's
ticket. He said he was advised last night
that the order had gone forth to the brave
boys who risk their lives for a paltry sum
and whose bread and butter depends on
their positions to get out and help the
man who controls their very existence.
He also said that he had no ambitions to
gratify and ail he desired was that the
Democratic citizens of this city be per
mitted to go out to-day and cast their
votes without molestation.
In answer to a question put to him by
one of his friends as to whether ne was
aware of the attack on him in the Exam
iner he replied that he was familiar with
the assault. "The attacks on me," he
said, "are personal, not political. Some
years ago the then managing editor of
that paper called on me and wanted me to
nominate a man for Congress by the name
of Jerry* Lynch, a stock broker, who had
failed in business, stating that Lynch
would pay him $3000 for his aid. Of course
I refused to have anything to do with it.
"This scurrilous attack is made on me
in a general way. They do not point to
any specific transaction, but they take
their slush bucket and daub their vile
slanders all over me. I have charged
them in a specific manner with acts that
they do not dare refute. Why don't the
Examiner reply?
"The "Mudmiir speaks of association
with a corrupt boss. Max Popper is tly-Ir
intimate friend. They have hidden him
during this campaign for reasons best
known to themselves. Notwithstanding
that Popper had knowledge of all the cor
ruption done in politics they still cham
pion his cause. The Examiner like Pop
per, when called Upon to defend itself, re
fuses to answer. _'__': . Â
â¢'The programme of the managing edi
tor of the Examiner at this time is that
he wants to control the convention for the
same Ignoble purposes his predecessor
had. It looks as if he would like to sell
nominations. '"â â¢-â¢; _â¢â â *'
"I have advised my men to keep the
peace to-morrow, and I have asked tho
Chief of Police to send his officers to the
various precincts to protect these citizens.
I only ask that the citizens of this city be
given a fair chance to choose* the men
they want in the convention. The law |
provides that at the election to-moi row a
Comity Committee be elected. As the men j
who compose that body control the party, !
it behooves the citizens of this city to j
choose wisely between the people and the ,
unholy Examiner-Rainey alliance."
THANKED THE CALL. .
Members of the Thirty- j
District Compliment the-
Paper for Its Fairness.
The delegates and representatives .of
the conference committee of the Demo
cratic League of Clubs of the Thirty-first
District met last night to air their griev
ances for the treatment they had received
from the Examiner and the Bulletin. It
had been charged that the delegates rep- |
resented the boss element in Democratic I
politics and were not true to the candi- |
dacy of Mayor Phelan. All of these |
charges were denied by numerous speak
ers, and the papers making them were .
roundly condemned. The Call was com
plimented for the fairness It had shown |
to all parties during the campaign, and j
upon a rising vote It was unanimously re- j
solved that every member of the league j
should give it his support.
Ex-Assemblyman Timothy Treacy, one |
of those who had been assailed, led in the
denunciation of the league's enemies. He
said: "We are not masquerading. We are
attending to our own business and trying
to "work in the interests of the people of
thlsdlstrict. We have indorsed Phelan, and
when we say we have done that we have
gone far enough. But the bosses are mas
querading behind the good name and pop
ularity of the Mayor. From one side we
hear that if we are not taking orders from
McNab or some other boss we must be in
the camp of Buckley or Rainey. Our
crime seems to be that we are Independ
ent of them all, and for our independence
we have been assailed by the organs of
these political corruptionists, the Exam
iner and the Bulletin."
J. C. A. Wehr, Horace Jackson, Gus
Asmussen and many others spoke in a
similar strain. One of the speakers said
that their delegates had been charged
with being cutthroats, hoodlums and ev
erything else that was bad, but stated
that they represented over $100,000 worth
of taxable property in the district, by
wav of refutation.
Chairman Charles Holcomb stated that
the delegates who were receiving the. sup
port of the Examiner had not been named
by the people, but had been put up at
a private conference held downtown. He
stated further: "The Examiner has gone
Into politics and is no longer in the busi
ness of giving the news. It should be.
treated the same as any other political
â  boss. It is the duty of the people .to
stand by the paper that treats them fairly.
and prints the truth. I refer to The Call.
The mention of this paper was greeted
with cheers. -tftf.- yy- -.-"v
The meeting was a representative one
and very enthusiastic.
The. German Democratic Club met In its
headquarters, Norman's Hall, 411 Busn
street, last night and passed the follow
ing resolution:

tral Club heartily indorses the distinguished

of Orange County.' is visiting friends in
San , Francisco. Mr. Edelman was a can
didate for the nomination for Treasurer
at the Democratic State Convention held
at Sacramento last summer. It was then
strongly urged that Orange County should
be represented on the ticket. While visit
ing here Mr. Edelman has consented to
serve as a delegate In the .Democratic
Municipal Convention of San Francisco.
The Committee of One Hundred being shy
of resident material placed Mr. Edelman
on the ticket as one of the representatives
in the Thirty-ninth District. _ â  '
The Democrats of the Thirty-first. Dis
trict have issued a circular to the voters
of that district urging them not to be de
ceived by the bosses, who claim to be
friendly to Mayor Phelan but who are in
fact not in favor of honest government.
They ask all voters desirous of a clean,
decent government to vote the ticket
headed by Charles H. Holcomb in that
district.

through its president, J. Harris, and, Sec
retary W. W. Campbell, has Issued an ap
peal to voters. One paragraph in the ap
peal Is as folows:
This is the time for action. Every
good citizen should make a determined
effort at the polls to-morrow to secure
the election of such delegates to the
municipal conventions who will nomi
nate none but honest and reliable men
ln order to improve the advantages
that we have within our reach.
AFTER THE TURNTABLES.
Supervisors Called Upon to Declare
Them Public Nuisances.
The Supervisors will make another at
tempt to rid the streets of the turntables
operated by the . Market-street Railway
Company. A resolution with that point in
view was introduced in the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday by Supervisor Bying
ton. The preamble of the resolution re
cites that the Supreme Court decided
when an attempt was made to remove the
turntable at Geary and Market streets
that the matter could only be reached by
general regulation and not by special or
der. Upon" this decision Supervisor By
ington based his resolution, which makes
the construction and maintenance of any
turntable or similar device for turning or
switching cars upon public street cross
ings a misdemeanor punishable by a fine
of not less that $100 nor more than $1000,
or Imprisonment for six months, or both.
The resolution was passed' to print.
SEWER COMMISSION INVALID.
No Law Exists for Its Creation by
the ' Supervisors.
General Dickinson yesterday' advised
Auditor Wells that In his opinion the
sewer commission appointed by the Board
of Supervisors was not a legal body. The
law, he said, empowered the Board of Su
pervisors to appoint either an architect
or an engineer, but not to create a com
mission. Auditor Wells immediately noti
fied Mayor Phelan and his attorney,
Daniel C. Murphy, and together they went
to Wells' office, where a hot discussion
ensued. General Dickinson read the sec
tion which he has discovered and now the
Mayor will attempt to straighten the mat
ter out by having the board appoint one
of the present commission a chief engi
neer and empower him to employ assist
ants. If the present commission had
been permitted to proceed any bond Issue
that might have ensued for sewer pur
poses would have been invalid.

Vessels Building Ove
rdue Ships.
The transport Morgan City was sched
uled to sail for Manila to-day with 800
recruits, but' owing to the non-arrival of
some freight she will not now get away
before Thursday. The St. Paul is. going
to Seattle to help carry the Fourth Cavalry
to Manila, the Siam will not be ready
for her cargo of horses for ten days, the
Hancock will be at least six weeks at the
Union Iron Works, the Relief will be
overhauled and will go back to the Philip
pines for another load of wounded, the
Senator is coaling at Broadway wharf and
the Leelanaw discharged her Filipinos
yesterday and went to the Union Iron
Works.
In connection with the arrival of the
I transport Sherman with the California
boys a big mistake has been made. Colo
nel Duboce has cabled that he will so ar
range matters that the transport will be
off the Faraliones at noon of the day
she will arrive. What he should have done
was to have her off Point Reyes at that
hour. The Point is the first land Captain
Grant will make on a direct course from
Yokohama to San Francisco, and in or
der to make the Faraliones he will have
to go out of his way. Directly the Sher
man is spoken off Point Reyes the fact
would be known in San Francisco, thus
giving at least two hours and a half to
make necessary preparations. From the
Faraliones the proposition is to bring the
news in by tug, but there is not a tug in
the bay that can outrun the Sherman,
and more than likely both will be sighted
together by the Merchants' Exchange
lookout at Point Lobos. It should be so
arranged that the Sherman will be report
ed from Point Reyes and then everybody
will have ample time to reach the water
front before the transport gets in.
A three-cornered race from here to
Honolulu will begin to-morrow and con
siderable Interest is attached to the event,
as the vessels are three of the fastest of
the sugar fleet. The barkentine S. N.
Castle will get away this afternoon, while
the barkentine Planter and the bark S. C.
Allen will leave together early Wednesday
morning. Captain Hubbard of the Castle
Is going to make the most of his start
and expects to get to Honolulu first even
if he does not win the race. Captain Mc-
Neill of the Planter is sure that he will
be first to sight Diamond Head and has
bet Captain Perriman a suit of clothes
that he will make the islands first. The
vessels are very evenly matched and it Is
a toss up as to which one will win.
Two new vessels for the lumber trade
and one for the oil trade are being built
at Eureka. One of the lumber vessels will
be the steamer Dispatch, for Gray &
Mitchell, and the other will be the
schooner Alexander, for Charles Nelson.
The Alexander will carry 800,000 feet of
lumber, and Captain Senate of the Allen
A will command her. The Dispatch will
have first-class passenger accommoda
tions, and will carry 650.000 feet of lumber.
The transport Hancock will dock at the
Hunters Point drydock. It was stated a
few days ago that the vessel would have
to go to Hongkong or Port Orchard to
drydock, as she was too long for Hunters
Point. This was incorrect, as there is
not only room for the Hancock there but
eighteen feet to spare. All arrangements
for docking the vessel have been made,
and as soon as she is overhauled at the
Union Iron "Works she will go on Hunters
Point. It is the intention of the California
Drydock Company, shortly, to lengthen
the Hunters Point drydock to 610 feet on
th" sill, and Howard C. Holmes, the chief
engineer of the Harbor Commission, is
engaged in getting up the plans and speci
fications. __ _._,__. '
The British ship Hyderabad is lying in

WANTED TO HUG THEM.
An Insane Young Man Makes Violent
Love to Two Girls.
A young man giving his name as George
Marks yesterday afternoon accosted two
girls on Sutter street, near Scott, and
attempted to hug them. Their screams
attracted the attention of a citizen, who
notified the sergeant at the O'Farrell
street station. An officer was hurriedly
dispatched to the scene, and he placed
Marks under arrest. As he seemed to be
mentally unbalanced he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital and locked up in the
Insane ward pending an examination as
to his sanity. ___

HARRY COOPER THINKS
HE WAS A GOOD THING
GUARANTEED A $12 BELL AND
IS SUED FOR $1200.
Claims He Was Fooled by David
Bloom, the Artist, and Phil
Montague.
Harry R. Cooper of Cooper's bookstore,
746 Market street, thinks that he has been
made the victim of misplaced confidence.
His establishment was attached 0:1 Sat
urday afternoon in a suit for $1200 filed
by the Sunset Photo-engraving Company.
The matter involves the publication of
the history of thÂ© First California Regi
ment, with which Cooper says he had
nothing to do except to befriend the pub
lishers. David Bloom, the artist, and Phil
Montague, ex-secretary of the Press Club.
According to Mr. Cooper's story Mon
tague rushed into his place some months
ago and told him that the Sunset people
had $12 worth of cuts for the book which
they refused to surrender without the cash
or a guarantee that it would be paid.
Cooper wrote a note to the firm .hat he
would stand good for whatever Montague
had there. No amount was specified, and
right there is where Cooper thinks he
made a blunder that promises to be ex
pensive. On the strength of his note the
photo-engravers turned out $1200 worth of
work for Bloom & Montague. When the
bill was presented to Cooper and his at
tention called to the guarantee he was
dumfounded and refused payment. Hence
the suit. â Â _.
"If I owed the money, said Mr Cooper,
"I would pay it in a minute, but it was
my understanding that I was only guar
anteeing $12. The matter will be fougnt
in the courts."
The attachment was released yesterday
morning.
CITY HOSPITAL LOTS.
According to Old Laws They Belong
to San Francisco.
The city of San Francisco has won In
its actions against Honora Sharp, Eliza
M. Sharp and John H. Dunham. The ac
tions were to quiet title to a tract of land
which was designated on the Van Ness
map of 1856 as "hospital lots," and which
was originally part of the pueblo lands
of the city within the corporate lands as
defined in ISSI. The land was included in
the scope of the Van Ness and other or
dinances relating to the disposition of
pueblo lands, and which wer.- ratified by
the Legislature of March. 1853. â 
Defendants had possession of a portion
of the tract, and the possession so held
by them was derived continuously through
their predecessors in interest since i time
prior to January 1, 1855. The court below
rendered judgment declaring that the city
is the owner of the land in suit "in trust
for the use and benefit of the people of
the State of California and the inhabitants
of the city and county of San Francisco
for the purposes of a public hospital," and
that the defendants have no rights or in
terest in any part of the same.
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
A Despondent Restaurant Keeper
Turns on the Gas.
Because his wife took apartments on
another floor of his lodging house H. Le
Blanc, proprietor of the Saddle Rock res
taurant, 115 Stockton street, attempted to
end his life early yesterday morning in
his sleeping room. The despondent caterer
turned on the gas on retiring shortly after
midnight, and had it not been for the vigi
lance of the night clerk, who knew* that
Le Blanc and his wife were not on speak
ing terms, the would-be suicide would
doubtless have gone to the borne he
sought. '-.".- _/â  , __. Â
During the day Le Blanc and his wife
quarreled. Mrs. Le Blanc proved her hus
band's master in the wordy war which fol
lowed, and to even matters Le Blanc spent
an hour or two cutting her clothes to
shreds. ! Mrs. Le Blanc occupied a room in
another part of the house to annoy her
husband. * . -^ . â _â¢"â _"
When the night clerk, who smeller" the
escaping gas. broke Into Le Blanc room
he found both jets turned full on. Le
Blanc resented this visit as an intrusion
and attempted to claim that the night
clerk and special officer turned on the gas
when they entered the room. At latest
accounts he was still alive and kicking.
