Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept. 16.â Sunday will be
an anxious day for Great Britain. The
reply of the Transvaal Government, it
is known to-night, has been formu
lated and is In the hands of the British
a pent at Pretoria. Furthermore, the
â wires at the Foreign Office are busy
with a long dispatch from the British
High Commissioner in South Africa,
Sir Alfred Milner, to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, Joseph Cham
berlain, which is being rapidly re

] Southampton for Natal to-day was
| marked by such scenes as have not oc
curred in England for many years.
Wives, daughters, sweethearts and
friends crowded around the Northum
berland Fusiliers, or as they are better
known, ''the Fighting Fifth," at the sta
tions and at the docks, crying, waving
hats and handkerchiefs and cheering,
! mixing grief and patriotism as men
and women do only when those dear to
: them go to war. Most of the special
officers wore civilian clothes, but as
many of them were well known they
were quickly recognized and received
ovations. The "Fighting Fifth" nearly
! all wore the Khartoum medals.
BRITISH FORCES
DEPART FOR NATAL
â LONDON. Sept. 16.â The first bat
talion-of the Northumberland Fusiliers,
900 strong, and detachments of the
army service corps and ordnance
corps, sailed on the steamer Gaul at 2
p. in. to-day from Southampton en
, route to Natal, amid great enthusiasm.
The men appeared to be in splendid
J condition and openly anxious for fight
â  ing. The Fusiliers went direct from
i Aldershot, but many of the officers of
thai regiment and numbers of special
service officers started from London,
receiving at Waterloo station an en
' thusiastic send-off from the large
1 crowd present.. The porters cried "All
aboard for Pretoria," which was taken
up by the crowd uproariously.
General Sir George Stewart White,
V. C., former quartermaster general,
who is going to command the troops In
Natal, sails with his staff o n the Tantal
Castle from Plymouth. He left Lon
don subsequently to the main body of
officers. Though General .White tried to
keep private the hour of his departure
from oLndfon, a large crowd' was pres
) ent and gave him an ovation.
Captain Sir Edward Chichester, the
commander of the British cruiser Im
mortalite, at Manila, is among the of
ficers accompanying General White.
!!â¢â¢ is going to Cape Town to command
second class cruiser Doris, flagship
Admiral Harris. Captain Chichester
said to a reporter: "This is my first
march. It is difficult to say which way
events will turn. My work is among
the hewers of wood and drawers of
water. 1 am to hustle between Cape
Town and Delagoa Bay, the prospec
. tive seat of war. in the Doris, with pro
visions and equipment for the men. I
look back with vast pleasure at my old
American comrades, but am off to a
different scene of action. I am sorry
I cannot see the reception to Admiral
Dewey or join in welcoming such a
typical navy man. Admiral Dewey is
<iv~ to peace, while I fear I am off into
the thick of war. The scenes have
I changed, that is all. Good-by."
The crowd cheered lustily as the
train pulled out, and pressed around
the cars in order to get a handshake
with General White.

CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSED
QUARANTINE DISCUSSED
Eastern Physicians of the Opinion That This
State Has No Right to Exclude Con
sumptives.
O yEW YORK, Sept. 16.â The action by California looking toward the quarantining of that State against all
â  l\ I P ersons suffering with consumption has been viewed with interest by physicians in this city, and the ad
Â§ I\j visability of adopting stringent regulations for checking the disease in New York has been discussed.
*T -L 1 Dr - George F. Shrady says: "The idea of quarantining against tuberculosis as we do against an
actively contagious disease ?s too absurd for serious consideration. There is no warrant for It in a scien
v tiflc sense, nor is there reason for it from the standpoint of sound public policy. Tuberculosis Is not very
S readily communicable from one person to another unless In the latter case there is. a hereditary predisposition to
p the disease. Suppose other States should attempt to establish similar quarantines, what would become of the
S consumptive? He certainly has a right to live and breathe somewhere. Even a Californian hasn't an absolute
2% monopoly on climate and healthful surroundings of his State when a despairing consumptive needs them for a
# possible restoration to health. To deny him this privilege on the score of increased safety to the people is not
iS only cruel, but absurd."
O "It was stated that 20,000 persons welcomed President McKlnley at Ocean Grove recently by giving the
Â§ 'Chatauqua salute,' " said Dr. Newton to-day. "A very pretty exhibition, no doubt, but it will be followed in
Â£S many cases with fatal results. In a crowd of 20,000 persons I would say there were 4000 suffering with pulmon
s> ary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is acquired by direct transmission of the tubercle bicilll from the sick to the
0 well. I do not believe that the plan proposed in California for quarantining against all persons suffering from
g consumption will prove practicable."
g Dr. Roger S. Tracy of the Health Department said: "I do not think the plan proposed in California would
Â« prove practicable."
28 Dr. A. Guernsey Rankin, who has made a special study of diseases oof the lungs, said: "I regard the pro-
P- posed quarantine in California as rather drastic. Tuberculosis is a communicable disease, but it is distinctly pre
gj ventable."
Â£8 Dr. R. W. Steger, who is acquainted with the conditions in California, said: "I do not wonder that residents
Â£ of other towns in California caught the alarm that seemed to have started in Los Angeles over the increasing
$ number of consumptive visitors. I do not think that consumptives should be prevented from entering that State,
#'. but I do believe they should be isolated while they are undergoing treatment."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA. Sept. 16.â The cruiser
Charleston at daylight Thurs
day morning joined the patrol
ship Zafiro near Grande Isl-
and, Stibig Bay, with the ob
ject of dismounting the gun at Olau
gapo that had been used by the insur
gents. The Charleston stood in front
of the town while the Zafiro sailed
northward. At 5000 yards the Charles
ton began shelling the enemy, who re
plied at once. The first shot from the
insurgents' gun burst a boat's length
ahead of the Zafiro, while the second
ricochetted between the Charleston's
masts. The Charleston kept throwing
in eight-inch shells with great accur
acy and soon destroyed the earth
works around the gun. which the cap
tain of the cruiser believed had been
dismounted.
ThÂ»>n the Charleston steamed closer !
in shore and got within 3000 yards of
the earthworks. The insurgents at
once began firing again, and some of
the shells fell very close to the cruiser.
Both ships then withdrew, the Zafiro
returning to Manila, while the Charles
ton remained in Subig Bay.
The Filipino fire was remarkably ac
curate, and the gun was probably not
handled by native gunners. Black
powder was used and six or nine inch
Spanish shells fired. The Charleston
fired sixty-nine shells.

CITY OF CARACAS, CAPITAL OF VENEZUELA.
According to The Call's Washington advices, the insurgents of Venezuela are marching toward the capital city,
with a view to its capture. So serious has the situation become that President Andrade has gone to Valencia to person
ally take command of the Government forces.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1399, by James Gordon Bennett.
CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept, 16.â Cipriano Castro, at the head of
the revolutionary army, has fought and won a bloody battle
near Tacuyo. He has taken Valencia and Puerto Cabello and
it is believed the killed and wounded will number 1600. It is re
ported that Senor Ferrer, Minister of War, has been killed. Presi
dent Andrade, who left on Thursday to put himself at the head of
the Government forces in Valencia, is said to be returning to
Caracas.
ADVICES INDICATE
SPREAD OF REVOLUTION
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.âInforma
i tion received at the State Department
to-day from Mr. Russell, the American
Charge d' Affaires at Caracas, indicates
that tlie revolution in Venezuela is
spreading. According to the depart
ment's information, the insurgents
have captured Valencia and the sea
port of Puerto Cabello, and no surprise
would be manifested if Information
should be received indicating that the
country to the west of Valencia is in
possession of the insurgents.
Mr. Russell indicated that warships
were desirable. The dispatch was re
ferred to the Navy Department, and
Acting Secretary Allen notified the
State Department that if it desired an
other ship ordered to Venezuelan
waters li* 1 would send instructions to
j the gunboat Nashville, now at Glbara.
! It is thought that the Detroit, which is
hourly expected at La Guayra. will be
sufficient to look out for American in
terests. When I saw Senor Pulido,
Charge d' Affaires of th.' Venezuelan le
gation here, he told me he had received
absolutely no advices from his Govern-
I ment respecting the revolution, and he
' is inclined to believe that the reports of
i the successes of the revolutionists are
manufactured.
"I cannot even tell you the cause of
the revolution," he said to me this af
ternoon. "I propose to cable to my
Government asking that I be informed
j of the progress of events, but at pres
ent I am officially ignorant. "When
President Andrade started for the
front, several days ago, he very prob
ably took with him a large force, and
I would like to know where he was
during the fighting. I can hardly be
; Wove that the insurgents, without or
j ganization or equipment, could be as
successful as the press dispatches in
dicate.
"In the great revolution of 1892 the
insurgent forces fought for a year be
fore they captured Caracas, and when
they entered the capital they had only
a small force of 11,000 men. The rea
son why the Government has such a
small army is because it is impossible
to handle a large corps in the moun
tains of my country. I am hopeful
that the information I shall receive
will fully describe the situation, and
I am confident it will show that the
Government forces have been vic
torious."
NASHVILLE MAY ALSO
GO TO VENEZUELA
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â 1n an an
swer to an inquiry from Acting Secre
tary McAdee, the Navigation Bureau of
the Navy Department stated that the
cruiser Detroit will arrive at La Guay
ara Monday next. As some apprehen
sion exists as to the security of Ameri
can interests in Venezuela in the inter
val before the arrival of the Detroit,
the State Department officials have
made the settlement that, save in the
Prestan revolt at Panama in 1884. there
has been no instance in which Ameri
can interests have suffered directly in
Central or South America through the
absence of a warship. However, if the
situation should continue without im
provement in Venezuela, the Navy De
partment will dispatch the Nashville,
now at Gibara, to reinforce the De
troit.
BOLD ROBBERY OF
BANK BY SIX MEN
JOLIET, 111., Sept. 16.â Six robbers
blew open the safe of the Exchange
Bank at Frankfort, a small village
fifty miles east of Joliet, early this
morning and carried away nearly $2000
in currency.
Night Watchmar Knipple was blind
folded, gagged and thrown Into a ditch,
while one man stood guard over him.
Then the bank was broken into and
work began on the safe. Three ex
plosions were necessary to blow off the
door. The first aroused a family living
above the bank, but the terrified people
were ordered not to make an outcry or
strike a light under penalty of death.
Having secured the money the robbers
departed, leaving the night watchman
helpless in the ditch. â¢

ESCAPED PRISONER IS
FINALLY RETAKEN
Rev. Mr. Howard Considered by Pos
tal Authorities Cleverest Con
fidence Man in the World.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â An ac
complished swindler, shrewd confidence
man and a fugitive from justice for
years. Rev. Dr. G. T. Howard, was cap
tured to-day by Postofnce Inspectors
j Baird and Gould at Jackson, Miss.,
j whence he will be taken to Columbus,
0., to serve out the unr-xpired term of
his sentence in the Ohio Penitentiary.
Howard escaped from the penitentiary
about two years ago, after having
served three years of a nine years' sen
tence for using the United States mails
for fraudulent purposes. He is a doctor
of divinity and a lawyer and was the
editor of two or three religious publi
cations. At his first trial witnesses
were subpenaed from all parts of this
country and Europe, among them being
Hon. Robert T. Lincoln, Minister to
Great Britain, and Hon. J. <*'. Now,
Consul General to London. The jury
disagreed and he was convicted on his
second hearing.
By sending broadcast over this coun
try circulars representing that the re
cipients were heirs tt> estates in various
places in Europe, Howard, under the
name of E. Ross, manager of the Eu
ropean Claims Agency, obtained re
mittances of $25 from many of his vic
tims on the pretext that he would prose
cute their claims to the estates. He
operated all over the world. His scheme
netted him thousands of dollars. Since.
his escape from the penitentiary he
has been operating in the West, his
victims principally residing in Great
Britain. He is regarded by the postal
authorities- as one of thÂ« most danger
ous confidence men and swindlers in
the country.
ROBBERY ON A STEAMER.
TACOMA, Sept. 16.â The steamer
Dirigo brought down a large number
of Klondikers, who left Dawsn n Au

up the river on the steamer Willie Ir
ving. An exciting incident occurred
on the 'way up. There were eighty-one
passengers 6n the steamer, and some
where between the mouth of Little
Salmon River and White Horse Rapid 3
a forty-ounce sack of gold dust was
stolen from the purser's room. The
purser claims that he went away for
a moment, leaving his room door and
the treasure box unopened. \r\ thÂ«
meanwhile some one got away with
one of the. sacks, worth $700. Several
passengers had left the boat before the
theft was discovered.
When the Irving got to White Horse
the mounted police were nntifiod and a
round-up was ordered. All had to sub
mit to being searched and every man's
gold was weighed. The missing gold
was not located. Some of the Ameri
can miners were indignant at the idea
of having to meekly submit to being
"stood up" and searched.

ALGER'S WITHDRAWAL
MAY HELP THE PARTY
Osborne Suggested for Governor and
Pingree as Candidate for the Sena
torial Toga.
Q WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â The withdrawal of former Secretary Al- 9
r from the Senatorial contest in Michigan is looked upon by Michi- &
i-:an'lf*rs here as a step in the direction of the unification of the several
Â£$ factions of the Republican party In that State. All prominent public kS
it> men representing Michigan are out of the city at present, but those who fi
V have watched the progress of events predict that General Alger's with- Â§
Â£Â£ drawal Is the result of advice given him by his friend and adviser. Rail- j*
j> road Commissioner Osborne, and they expect that in consequence of his Â§
g withdrawal Mr. Osborne will be agreed upon by the McMillan-Plngree- *?
Â£â Â»' Alger faction as a candidate for Governor.
"Whether Governor Pingree will be a candidate for the Senate to sue-
." r^ed Senator McMillan now that General Alger has withdrawn Is not 8?
â inltely known. The best opinion, however, seems to be that McMil- O
â¢i will be allowed a clear field. The Senator is now in Massachusetts &
iÂ» and he proposes, according to advices rvceived here, to go to his home Â®
Â£ on the Ist of October and remain there until Congress convenes, perfect- 3
Â£ ing the organization of the State for the coming elections, and it would *?
tbe surprising if he were selected as chairman of the Republican &

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, Sept. 16.â Mrs. Dan

her father, which is estimated to be
quite valuable, and in connection there
with is quite an interesting story.
About twenty years ago a man named

; About eight or nine years afterward
; Mr. Connors went to Arizona to enerage

At that time she also made a discov
ery both interesting and surprising.
I She learned that at the time she came
to California her mother was still liv
ing and her real maiden name was Mo-
Coy and not Connors. Her father told
her these things while In a communi
cative mood. But he was naturally
quiet ;?nd reserved and withheld many
'; particulars concerning their early life
that no doubt would have been of much
I interest to her.
He told Mrs. Nason nothing more ex-
I cept that he assumed the name of Con
nors in order that his wife might not
know of his whereabouts. These reve-
I lations, for the time being, Mrs. Nason
kept i" herself, or if she confided them
at all it was only to the most trusted
'* and confidential friends.
After a brief visit Mr. McCoy re
, turned to Arizona and resumed his
mining operations without having
given his daughter m^ch information
'â  concerning the nature and extent of his
business.
A few months ago Mrs. Xason re
-1 ceived a letter purporting to come from
! a man who represented that he and
, Mr. McCoy were partners In some min
ing property. He wrote that Mr. Mc-
Coy was quite ill. A few days later a
second letter tame, announcing his
death.
A short timÂ» afterward Information
came that McCoy left an estate which
needed attention. Mr. Xason made a
trip to Arizona to investigate. He as
certained that the deceased had an in
terest in a mine that is regarded as
good property, that he had some money
deposited In a local bank and about
$3000 deposited in the Hibernia Bank
at San Francisco.
Legal steps were at once commenced
to have the estate probated. At this
time there does not appear to be any
obstacles that will prevent it from be
ing closed at an early date. If the mine
is as valuable as those who know most
about it think Mr. and Mrs. Nason will
soon come into the possession of a
comfortable inheritance. They were at
one time residents of Woodland, but
now live at Arbuckle. Their many
friends will be pleased to learn of their
good fortune.
ARGUES BEFORE THE
ARBITRATION BOARD
Sir Eichard Webster Talks for Eng
land on the Venezuelan
Boundary.
PARIS. Sept. 16.â At to-day's session of
the Anglo-Veneiuelan Boundary Arbitra
: tion Commission Sir Richard Webster, the
British Attorney General, completed his
review of the treaty of Munster. He
Strongly attacked the theory of the over
lordship of Spain and showed the lmport
;iiice or considering the matter of spheres
i-i influence.
In the preftent discussion the spheres
1 pertaining to both countries are contended
â¢ to be on an equal footing. The evidence
; showed that the Dutch sphere was much
larger than Spain's and Venezuela had
produced few aota of control by Spain be-
Oftuse Spain then had no control. There
fore the theory of overlordship had been
adduced in order to rpinforce the fe-w acts
1 dono by Spain.
Sir lilchard urgred that Venezuela had
no title to Barlma, Though it might have
been offered by various Ministers as a
â  concession, It belonged by gTound right to
; England.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1899.
STATE FAIR COMES TO
A SUCCESSFUL CLOSE
It Is Roughly Estimated That the
Profits Will Be at Least Ten
Thousand Dollars.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 16.â The forty-
Bixth annual State Fair, the most suc
cessful affair of a similar character
conducted In this State for many years,
closed In an auspicious manner to
night. Hundreds of people who had
not attended the pavilion since the
opening of the State Fair visited It to
night. There was an immense throng
in the vast structure and the exhibitors
vied with each other in disposing of
the surplus samples of their stock. The
musical and vaudeville programmes
were specially arranged for the last
night and were excellently rendered In
every respect.
The representative of the California
Paris Exposition Commission has been
In attendance at the fair and he has
made known his desire to procure a
number of the finer exhibits for the use
of the commission. This request was
made known to the managers of the
splendid exhibit of Sacramento County,
who will lay the matter before the
Board of Supervisors, who no doubt
will heartily comply with the commis
sion's request.
Since the beginning of the fair this
city has entertained thousands of
strangers and they were pleased with
the treatment accorded them by the
residents of the Capital City. From
the very outset President A. B. Soreck
els and his colleagues of the State Ag
ricultural Society, working in conjunc
tion with the Citizens' State Fair Club,
labored assiduously for the success of
the State's great annual show, and
their labors have not been in vain. The
directors ypeak in glowing terms of
the valuable assistance rendered by the
citizens' committee and every one else
in making the fair a most complete suc
cess. Beyond a doubt the work done
by the citizens' committee this year
will be a criterion for similar commit
tees in the future, and will be renewed
with increased interest and enthu
siasm. , ,
From 9 to 10:30 o'clock to-night the
Citizens' State Fair Club gave a recep
tion to the exhibitors in the director?'
room, and a few hours were spent in
social intercourse and congratulatory
SALES OF GRAIN
BAGS LIMITED
Monthly Meeting of the
Prison Directors.
Special Dispatch "-to The Call.
SAN QUENTIX PRISON, Sept. 16.â
The Board of State Prison Directors
evidently fears that another attempt is
about to be made to corner the grain
bag output of the prison jute mill, for
at Its monthly meeting held to-day
steps were taken to prevent such a pro
ceeding. On motion of Director Wil
kins a resolution was adopted limiting
sales to lots of 2000, for the specified
reason that the orders now registered
will take all that can be manufactured
to October 1. The board also reserves
the right to refuse all orders when the
aggregate will exceed the raw jute out
put.
An unexpected zest was added to the
meeting by the appearance of George
King, an agent for a Kan Francsico oil
firm, who claimed in an address before
the board that the oil used in finishing
grain bags is not whale oil, as called
for in the specifications for bids, but
herring oil, which sells for 15 cents less
per gallon than whale oil. Warden
Aguirre furnished the expert opinion of
two chemists that the oil ustÂ»d is bet
ter than the sample supplied bidders.
A question arose as to where the sam
ple came from and nobody seemed to
know. King declared that something
was wrong and asked for an investiga
tion, whereupon the board laid the
matter over until the next meeting,
when a representative of the Arctic
( >il Works will be asked to be present
and answer King's charges, that com
pany furnishing the oil now used.
Two interesting cases of applications
for restoration of forfeited credits came
before the board. One was by William
Manning, the Mendocino stage robber
who escaped from prison in 1884, and,
with John Hanlon, ensconsed himself
in the hills near San Rafael and kept
a posse of officers at bay for a week.
Manning admitted to Devlin that an
ex-convict had furnished them arms,
but refused to give his name. The pris
oner was sent back to hie cell to think
it over.
Joseph F. Ross, serving a long term
from Merced, made a pitiful appeal, his
statements being corroborated by Ex-
Turnkey Jamieson. Ross lost his cred
its for making two attempts to escape.
He said that he left a young and inex
perienced wife in Merced, who was
forced, after many trials, to a life of
shame for support. Her letters of ap
peal maddened Ross and caused his at
tempts to escape. Finally the wife
died and since then the prisoner has
proved a model inmate. His credits
will probably be restored, which virtu
ally amounts to a pardon.
TERRIBLE DAMAGE
DONE BY THE STORM
Along the Nswfoundland Coast Scores
of Craft Have Been Wrecked
and Many Lives Lost.
ST. JOHNS, N. F.. Sept. Râ The Peary
relief steamer Diana returned from Syd
ney last night. Frightful damage was
done along the coast by Thursday night's
storm. Seven more fishermen are reported
to have been drowned, and scores of
schooners and other craft were driven
ashore. Â»
COCHRANE ARRESTED.
Beleased on Bail Furnished by His
Brothers.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 16.â Michael F.
Cochrane was arrested to-day by Con
stable George Agnow on a charge of per-
Jury preferred by Mrs. Charles W. Smyth
and taken before Recorder Gardner.
He was released upon furnishing $500
bail, with his brothers. James and Pat
rick Cochrane, as sureties. The prelimi
nary hearing was set for next Thursday.
Plague Is Feared.
LONDON. Sept. 16.â 1t was reported
from Falmouth that four deaths have oc
curred on board a Norwegian vessel at
that port. Fears were entertained that
they were cases of plague and the vessel
has been quarantined.

speeches by members of the Ajfricul
tural Society, the State Fair Club and
the exhibitors.
J. O. Coleman Introduced President A.
B. Spreckels to the exhibitors and in
vited guests. Mr. Spreckels said that
the people of the State were to be con
gratulated for the fair being such an
unqualified success. On behalf of the
society he thanked the Citizens" State
Fair Club for its valuable assistance
in the conduct of the fair. He also
thanked the exhibitors for their efforts
to make the institution a success and
for the extraordinarily fine display of
the products and resources of the State.
When Mr. Spreckels finished speaking
he was heartily cheered by those In at
tendance.
Vice President Frederick Cox also ad
dressed those present. He, too, thanked
every one connected with the fair for
their efforts in assisting to make a suc
cess of the show. The members of the
club of '99 also held a reception and en
tertained a large number of women who
had been invited to partake of their
hospitality. Refreshments were served
at both receptions.
The total receipts for both park and
pavilion for this year are $22,600. The
total for last year was $14,700, an in
crease for this year of $7900, or over 50
per cent gain. In addition to this there
was an increase of $5262 for betting
privileges, of $321 for programme priv
ileges and of $100 for pavilion privileges.
The expenses of administration this
year, notwithstanding the great growth i
of the exposition, do not exceed those
of 1898. The only particulars in which |
added expense was incurred was in the
electric light and power service fur
nished exhibitors, carpenter work in
preparing the grand stand and pavilion
to sustain the vast crowds which
thronged them, in plumbing and in '
preparing the great poultry' annex. The |
management has paid liberal and in
creased premiums to breeders and pro
ducers, has provided a more perfect j
police service and has improved the j
grounds and kept them clean and
orderly. Notwithstanding this a hasty I
casting up of accounts to-night indi
cates that there will be a clear profit of
over $10,000 to apply to the indebtedness
which accumulated in past years.
FATHER DE SMET'S
CROSS IS FOUND
Marks the Location of a
Rich Mine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 16.â According
to ::ews which has reached here from
U'irilemere the cross placed by Father
<ie Smcjt on Sinclair Pass In 1854. which hag
been the subject of more than one miner'?
<lr< am of wealth, has been found by a
trio of prospectors who have been seek
ing :he cross, which marks very rich
mineral deposits, for some thirteen years.
The reverend father, who was engaged
in missionary work in the Knot
forty-five years ago, after his return to
Franco In 1865 published a book on his
Travels in Northwest America. In this
volume ho tells of finding a ledge of rich
mineral in the vicinity of Sinclair Pass
and of placing a cross to mark the. find
for 3<>me fortunate prospector In some
distant time, as he prophesied that some
day the then sea of untrodden moun
tains would be a great mining country.
A copy of the book was found by sonic
prospectors about twenty years ago in
the library of Ft. Mary's mission in Bast
Kootenai anil an expedition was organ
ized t" Bearch for the cross. The search
was unsuccessful. Numerous other expe
ditions searched for the lo^t ledge with
out avail.
None were successful enough to find the
cross until last month, when a of
prospectorsâ Joe Lassrord, Dave Smith
and Frank Mnrsjeanâ found the remains
of the cross, which had fallen years ago
to decay among the rocks. For thirteen
years this trio have been searching for
t ho priest's mine and many are the hard
ships they went through before success
crowned their efforts.
Owing to the heavy fall of snow pros
| pecting was impossible and they returned
|to "Windemere. They will return next
i summer to further prospect and open up
! the mine.
RAILWAY STRIKE MAY
BE DECLARED OFF
Street-Car Men in Cleveland Are Los
ing Ground Against the Big
Corporation.
CLEVELAND, Sept. 16.â 50 many of
the street railway strikers are deserting
and applying for work with the big
' Consolidated Company that a number
of leading members of the union, head
ed by the vice-president, Charles Eber
ly, have demanded that a meeting be
j held for the purpose of considering
' whether the strike should not be de-
I clared <>ff. The meeting will be held in
j Arch Hall Sunday evening.
i Eberly believes that the strike should
be ended, in justice to the members of
the other trades unions, which impose
lines on their members found riding:
in Big Consolidated cars. Severe
weather is approaching and as the
strikers are not standing together, says
Eberly, it would be an injustice to al
low the large number of trades union
ists in the city to continue walking and
riding in open wagons.
President Everett and Superintendent
Douglass of the company declare that
the strike is completely broken, and
that more than 100 former strikers are
back at work and that others apply for
places every day and their names are
placed at the foot of the extra list.
They declare that they will not re-em
ploy any of the men who were guilty of
, lawlessness during the strikes. No
questions are asked of the men as to
whether they belong to a union or not.
FIREMEN OVERCOME.
Twelve Men Nearly Lose Tbeir Lives
in Milwaukee.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Sept. 16.â A flre
which threatened to be destructive broke
out In the foundry of the Milwaukee
Harvester Company's big plant on the
South Side this afternoon. The flames,
however, were gotten under control when
damage aggregating $10,000 was done.
Several barrels of rosin stored In the
foundry caught flre and twelve firemen
were overcome from the fumes. They
were quickly restored to consciousness,
however, and none of them suffered seri
ous injury- The work of two fire tups
prevented what would have been a heavy
loss.

NEW YORK, Sept. 16.â Vice-Presldent
Hobart, who was oonflned to his bed with

ABUSES IN LOS
ANGELES HOSPITAL
No Consideration Is
Shown Patients.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 16.â Patients
In the County Hospital have filed com
plaints with the Board of Supervisors
alleging the greatest cruelty and gross
negligence on the part of nurses em
ployed In that Institution. Charles H.
Earley, a patient. Is the author of the
complaint. He says that John Howie,
a Scotch boy, died in ward 10 under
the most horrifying surroundings from
hemorrhagesâ in fact, In his helpless
ness he fell from his bed and lay for
hours unnoticed until .the nurse,
Dougherty, finally covered the boy
with filthy clothes.
Earley cites another pathetic in
stance of abuse on the part of the
nurses in the case of Barney Silver
man, who was brought to the hospital
dying of consumption. On the night of
September 6 Silverman was in a dying
condition. He wanted to get to thÂ«
night chair, and pleaded for help.
Dougherty was at the time helping
Howie, and one of the patients named
Wheaton went to his assistance.
Silverman got to the chair and
Wheaton was waiting to help him back,
when Dougherty saw him and ordered
him to bed. Then he stood in front of
SUvermfcn and commanded him to "get
up and get into bed." Silverman could
not and Earley interposed. Dougherty
then assisted him to bed and, having
done so, said roughly to Earley, "I, want
you to mind your own business." "I
am minding my business," Earley re
plied. "I'll come over there and 111
throw you out of the window," Dough
erty said. Earley made some repiy and
Dougherty said threateningly, "I'll put
you in the insane ward."
Silverman was a corpse the next
morning, declares Earley in his report.
Dr. John Murietta was the physician in
charge of ward 10 at the time.
While this recital is dreadful, Earley
declares and he corroborates his state
ment by that of other patients that
when a colored man, Tobe by name,
died the attendants robbed the pockets
of the corpse. The whole matter will
be Investigated, as the people are de
termined to settle these scandalous re
ports regarding public institutions.

OBJECT TO SCHOOL TAX.
Citizens of San Diego File Suit to
Prevent a Special Levy.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 16.â A number of
tax-payers have joined in a suit against
the city to prevent the levy of a special
school tax of 37 cents on the $100 recently
voted at a special election in this city.
The levy is opposed by many citizens
on the ground that there is money enough
in the school fund if economically ex
pended and that the election was illegal
and ihe levy Is therefore Illegal. An In
junction was applied for in the Superior
Court to-day against the Board of Su
pervisors to prevent their adding this tax
to the annual levy which Is to be made
on Monday.

â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16.â at
tention of the State Department has
I been drawn to the situation on the
1 frontier of Arizona, where Mexican
and American troops are confronting
each other and trouble is threatened
;as the result of the killing of some
Mexican soldiers by cowboys.
The Mexican Embassador, Senor As
plros, now at Manchester-by-the-Sea,
has received a communication from his
Government on the subject, and this
was deemed of sufficient importance to
warrant a presentation of the facts
sent out to-day to Acting Secretary
Adee by Senor Santo Banos, the resi
dent member of the Mexican legation.
Mr. Adee, in turn, has called on the
Governor of Arizona for a statement
of the conditions on the border. Extra
dition proceedings can take place di
rectly between the Governors of the
j States without recourse to the State
! Departments of either the United
i States or Mexico.
In the present instance some of the
parties to the killing of the Mexican
officers have escaped into Arizona, and
serious resistance may be offered to
any effort to secure their arrest and
; return. The assistance of the United
States Government may be invoked.

Brooklyn, arrived in port to-day and
went to anchorage off Tompklnsvllle,

the Grand Army encampment. It
comes here to take part in the Dewey
celebration.
Hear Admiral Sampson smiled after
.-.? a clipping from a morning
Lper which said that the New
York was to take carrier pigeons on
1 axid Eteam out to sea to look for
1 vwey. releasing the birds as soon as
â¢ iympia was sighted.
'Dewey doesn't need any looking
. " the admiral said, as he handed
hvk the clipping. "This item," he
nued, "is a misconstruction of an
order which I have received directing
a dozen carrier pigeons from the
navy yard coop be received on board
New York, the birds to be released
when the Olympia is sighted corning
l;:to the harbor. There is no intention
<>f sending the New York to sea, so far
as I have been informed."
Nothing is yet known as to how
many of Dewey s captains will attend

CONFEDERATION
IS PRAYED FOR
Petition of South Aus
tralians.
Copyrighted. 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Sept. 15.â The first address
praying for confederation arrived this
week from South Australia. Others *ro
expected soon. The Secretary of State
for the Colonies, Mr. Chamberlain, is ex
pected to bring in the Federal enabling
bill early next session, which is the only
step now required to fill the desire of the
Australians. The Joint majority in favor
of the commonwealth bill in the colony
is estimated at 200.000. Lord Jersey, it
is surmised, will be the first Uoverimr
General and Sir George Turner the first
Premk-r.
Lord Rosebery's speech September 9 at
the dinner of the Caledonian Railway em
ployes, comparing British and Ameican
railways, has created comment.
The Saturday Review contests the for
mer Premier's solution by painting out
that Great Britain has borrowed many
railroad improvements from the United
States and might borrow more.
The Speaker says: AniL-noa. has prob
ably not much to teach us in railway
management. Unless we can bring out
s' Ives to ad' pt American ways we .
our very modified oligarchs to the rail
way autocrats of the United Sti
i'he president of the Board of Agricul
ture, Walter Ixing, is the latest victim
of the church dispute, his Liverpool con
i stituents censuring him because he voted
I agaiim the church discipline bill, there
by gaining a reputation as a defender of
the ritualists, it Is likely he will resign.
The Irony of this lies in the fact that Mr.
Long is an extremely low church man and
. voted because he thought the bill
; from a legal point of view. Such an cx
i pianation, however, is powerless against
t the "no popery" cry of his constituents.
The British Admiralty is experiencing
! the same tumeulty as was encountered by
| the United States Navy Department last
year in finding good machinists for ships
; at smaller salaries than are paid by the
merchant marine. The British navy
I larks 500 men of the number of these arti
'â¢ risers required to man vessels. To remedy
j this serious defeat it Is proposed to diviae
â ountry Into five marine engineering
I recruiting districts, each with an admir
alty agent, with a civilian engineer In
touch with the shipping centers, and
I maintain a substantial saiary and so
â  much for each recruit. The system has
I just commenced at Liverpool and Sun-
I derland, with signs of success.
The Secretary of War, the -Marquis of
â  Lansdowne, has Issued a circular to the
I general officers saving he has noticed
: that a predominant fashion exists among
I young officers to shave the upper lip, and
adding That thiÂ£ Is much to be regretted.
The result is that many unfertile lips
are being coerced. The regulation against
I Ing the upper lip has been little ob
served of recent years, and its revival is
pular.
'1 he Globe, commenting on the letter of
the United States Secretary of State,
Colonel John Hay. anent the treaties,
says: "There can never be anything in
I the nature of a combative alliance be
tween the two great English-speaking
;â¢â  plea until each Is in a position to offer
"ther an equitable quid pro quo."
Kr;,.)rts from the great royal gathering
â  in Denmark say the Czar Is amusing him
self playing tennis, chiefly with the Prln-
Victoria of Wales. In the evenings
King < hristlan has a rubber of whist and
ail retire early, except the Czar, who
works into the small hours on state pa
pers, which are brought daily from St.
Petersburg. Russian und Danish detec
tives surround Bergsdorff Castle.

CLOSE OF THE CONFERENCE ON
USES AND ABUSES OF TRUSTS
William J. Bryan Declares That Legislation Is
the Proper Remedy for Combinations.
Bourke Cockran's Second Address.
CHICAGO, Sept. 16.â The conference
on the uses and abuses of trusts
closed its session here to-day in a blaze
of oratory in which Colonel William J.
Bryan and W. Bourke Cockran were
the central figures. Mr. Cockran fol
lowed the noted Nebraskan, but dis
claimed any intention of debating the
conclusions of his immediate predeces
sor and declaring his complete con
currence in much that Mr. Bryan had
said.
The Westerner had delivered the
! speech of the day during the forenoon
i amid frequent interruptions of tumult
| uous applause. Mr. Foulke of Indiana,
I commenting on the speech, made asser
! tions which Mr. Bryan desired further
ito discuss. He was requested to take
i the stage and complied, for the second
â  time facing a wildly enthusiastic house.
At the conclusion, Mr. Cockran arose
| and observed: "Just a few words."
j The spectators wanted more and re
i fused to subside until he had taken the
platform. He agreed with Mr. Bryan,
he said, but he wanted information.
Phe crowd which greeted Colonel
an when the doors were thrown
a amounted almost to a mob. Cen-
Musio Hall was jammed from pit
gallery with admirers of the Ne
braskan. When he had concluded his
! speech SO per cent of the audience de-
I parted, leaving a few straggling spec
tators to listen to the remaining speak
ers and the report of the committee
â¢ on resolution.
Ex-Governor Luce of Michigan was
i chairman of this committee and he rtg-
I idly adhered to the resolutions passed
yesterday, in which it was resolved
that no resolutions giving the senti
| ment of the conference on the trust
| problems should be presented or con-
i sidered.
Mr. Keasley x>f Xew Jersey, a mem
ber of the committee, declared that he
j had spoken with Colonel Bryan, and
i that the latt-r had given it as his opin
j ion that the nature of the conference
j made resolutions expressive of senti
i ment on the problem out of place. He
proposed that to the original resolu
tions be added something to the effect
that the coneference had been of bene
fit to the delegates, had cleared thelf-
I minds of many doubts and enlightened
; their understanding. These suggestion*
were not considered.
The decision of the committee as
submitted in Chairman Luce's report
was unanimously adopted, as was a
motion put before the house thanking
tlu> Civic Federation for its entertain
ment of the d^legeites.
Other speakefs during the day were
J. H. Raymond, <J. W. Northrup Jr..
Professor David Kinley. T. B. Walker,
\V. W. Howe, "x-Senator Blair of New
Hampshire, Attorney General T. S.
Smith of Texas, J. B. Dill, A. Copeland.
W. D. Foulke, while many others took
part in the discussion which closed the
conference.
It was derided that those who had
j prepared speeches, but had not been al
lowed, owing to the limitation of the
programme, to read them, should de
liver them into th* hands of Secretary
Easley to be published In book form,
together with those which had been de
i llvered- from the stage.
In his principal speech during the
1 morning session, Mr. Bryan said:
The trust question has grown in lm
i portance. Within the past two years more
i trusts have been organized than were
i organized In all the previous history of
i the country, and the people now corns
! face to face with this question. Is the
! trust a blessing or a curse? it' a curse,
. what remedy can be applied to the
j curse? 1 want to start with the declar
| atlon that monopoly in private hands is
1 Indefensible from any standpoint and
Intolerable. One trust may be less harm
ful than another. One trust magnate may
; be more benevolent than another; but
! there is no good monopoly in private
! hands, and I do not believe it is safe for
BO< lety to permit any man or group of
I men to monopolize any article of mer
chandise or any branch of business.
The defense of the monopoly Is always
; placed on the ground that if you will
' allow people to control the market and
lix the price they will be good to the peo
ple who purchase of them. The entire de
' fense of the trusts rests upon a money
argument.
Jn the early years of Lincoln's admin
| istration he sent a message t" Congress,
and in that message he warned his coun
-1 trymen against the approach of monarchy,
i lie said it was the attempt to put capital
! upon an equal footing with, if not above,
: labor in the structure of government, and
; in that attempt he saw the approach of
monarchy. Lincoln was right. Whenever
you put capital on an equal footing with
labor, or above labor, in the structure of
i government you are on the road to aid-
Ing a government that rests not upon
i reason, but vipon force.
Nothing is more Important than that we
i shall, in the baginning. rightly under
stand the relation between money and
man. What is the purpose of trusts or
thy monopoly? For when 1 use the word
' "trust" I use it in the sense that the word
ns monopoly; and what is the pur
pose of monopoly?
The first advantage of a monopoly is to
lower the price of the raw material fur
i nlshed by the people to that combination.
i The next thing is, after you have bought
i up all the factories, to close a part of
! thpm and turn out of employment the
: men who are engaged In them, and If you
j will look over the country you will see
! whpre those enterprises, having come
1 under the control of the trusts, have been
closed up and stand now as silent monu
ments to the wisdom of the trust system.
We must recognize selfishness, and we
mu=t so make <mr laws that people shall
: not be permitted to trespass upon the
rights of others In their r-ffor*p to secure
, advantages for themselves. I believe that
society is Interested In the Independence
of every citizen. Society is interested In
this, because if a man dies and leaves no
provision for his wife and children the
i burden falls upon society.
I believe that the principle of monopoly
fiiids its inspiration in the desire of men
to secure by monopoly what they cannot
secure in the open field of competition.
: Another thing that, to my judgment, has
aided monopoly is a high tarlfT. Nobody
can dispute th.it ft tariff law, import duty,
enables a trufet to charge for Its product
the pri'e of a similar foreign product,
plus the tariff.
Now, some have suggested that to put
everything on the free lists that trusts
make would destroy the trusts. I dn not
agree with this statement, as It is made so
. broadly. I believe that the high tariff has
; aided the trust to collect more than the
trust otherwise could collect. But I do
not believe that you could destroy nil
trusts by putting all trust-made articles
on the tree list. Why? Because tf an
article can be produced in this country
as cheaply as it can bo produced abroad.
: the trust could exist without the benellt
: of any tariff at all. although It could not
! extort so much as It could with the tar
iff, and while some relief may come with
'. modifications of the tariff we cannot de
! stroy monopoly until we lay the ax at
the root of the tree and make monopoly
impossible by law.
It has been suggested that discrimina
tion by railroads has aided the trusts.
There is no question that discrimination
and favoritism, secured by "ne corpora
â  tlon against another, has been largely in
strumental in enabling a desired raonop-
I oly to become practically a complete mo
| nopoly.
Now that can be remedied by laws that
j will prevent this discrimination, and when
' we prevent the discrimination, still mo
! nopoly may exist. The remedy must be
' complete enough to prevent the organi
i zation of n monopoly. Both State ann
'â  P'ederal government should hava reme
i dies.
I believe that Congress has the power
to place such restrictions and limitations,
i even to the point of prevention, upon any
I corporation organized In one State that
wants to <Jo business outside of the
State.
Now, I believe that these concurrent
remedies will reach the difficulty: That
the people of every State shall first de
cide whether or not they want to create a
corporation; that they shall, secondly, de
cide whether they want any outside cor
poration to do business in the State, and
1f so, upon what conditions: and, thirdly,
that Congress shall exercise the right to
place upon every corporation doing busi
ness outside of the State in which it is
organized similar restrictions as may be
needed for the public good.
If it is unconstitutional and so de
clared by the Supreme Court, I am in fa
vor of an amendment to the constitution
that will give to Congress power to de
stroy every trust in the country. The
tirstcondition which I suggested was that
no water should be allowed in the Btock.
I do not believe that any State should
permit the organization of any corpora
tion with a single drop of water in the
stock of that corporation.
If a license is granted, then the first
conditions can be that any corporation
desiring to do business outside of the
State in which it is organized shall bring
to that board or body proof that the
stock is bona fide and that there is no
water in it. In my judgment when you
take frcm monopoly th*> power to issue
stock represented by no money you wi!l
go more than half "the way toward de
stroying monopoly in the I'nited States.
You can provide fur publicity and that
annually or at oth^r times the corpor
ations shall make returns of Its business,
and when you provide for publicity so
that the puMic shall know Just what
there is in the corporation you will go an
other long Â«tpp toward the destruction
of the principle of monopoly.
A third condition 1 suggest Is that this,
li'-'-nse shall -not be granted until the cor
poration shall show that it has not had
a monopoly and is not attempting a
monopoly of any branch of Industry or
any article of me'rehandise, and to provide
that if the law is violated the license can
be revoked.
Now. I may be mistaken, but it has
seemed to me that this method of dealing
with the trusts would prove an effective
method. 1 do not believe it is the natural
outgrowth of unnatural conditions created
by man-made laws. You cannot hide be
hind the doctrine that it is here and you
cannot get rid of it. I believe that the
American people can get rid of anything
that they don't want, and that they ought
to get rid of everything that is not good.
I believe that the Declaration of Inde
pendence was the grandest document ever
penned by human hands. The truths of
that declaration are condensed into four
great propositionsâ that all men are cre
ated equal ; that they are endowed with
Inalienable rights; that governments are
instituted among men to preserve these
rights, and that governments derive their
Just powers from the consent of the gov
erned. Such a government Is impossible
under industrial aristocracy. Place the
food and clothing and all that we eat and
wear and use In the hands of a few people
and Instead of being a government by the
people it will be a government of the syn
dicates by the syndicates and for the syn
dicates. Establish such a government and
the people will soon be powerless to secure
a legislative remedy for any abuse.
I am not willing to place the laboring
men of this country absolutely at the
mercy of the heads of monopolies. When
you control the price that a man is to re
ceive for what he produced, you control
the price that he is to receive for the
labor in the production of that thing.
Some people have tried to separate the
laboring man who works in the factory
from the workingman who works on the
farm. I warn the laboring men in the
factories that when they join with the
monopolies to crush the farmer, as soon
ns the farmer is crushed the laboring man
will be crushed, and his ally will be de
stroyed; and In a test of endurance the
farmer will stand It longer than tho labor
ing man. The farmer was the first man
on the scene when civilization began, and
he will be the last one to disappear.
But. my friends, why should we try to
see who could hold out the longest in suf
fering? For one hundred years all na
tions have looked to this nation for hope
and instruction. Lft us settle these gr.-at
questions that we have; let us teach the
wo^d the blessing of a government that
comes from the people, and let us sh>w
them how happy and how prosperous peo
ple can be.
The afternoon session opened with
addresses by Attorney General Smith

Colonel Bryan, who was sitting in
the back part of the hall, arose and.
amid cheering, started to reply. Before
he had uttered a dozen words, however,
cries of "Take the platform!" came
from all parts of the hall, and with a
smile he did so. In concluding his
speech Mr. Bryan said:

SHE WANTED TO
BE A SAILOR
Young Lady Runs Away
From Home.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSBND, Sept. 16.â LovÂ© of
the sea and a desire for a life on the
ocean wave induced Miss Kate Ross, aged
â J2. a leading society young lady of Bal
iard, Wash., to run away from home.
Last evening Miss Koss left her home,
announcing that she was going fur a row
on the bay. according to her custom. In
stead of Returning at the usual hour she
continued her journey down ttio Sound in
her frail craft until the reached the en
trance, to Fuca Straits, a distance of forty
miles, where a heavy swell was running.
Her courage failed her and she hailed a
passing steamer and she and her boat
were taken aboard and landed at Seattle.
She then boarded a steamer for Victoria,
arriving here this morning. Being recog
nized on tho passage from Seattle, the
Chief of Police was notified and ahe was
brought ashore and her relatives Informed
of her whereabouts.
Owing to her social standing, when she
disappeared great excitement prevailed in
Billiard, and searching parties started
out both by land and water and the
search was continued for four days, and
she was given up as having been drowned.
The only explanation she would give of
her strange conduct was that she wanted
to become a sailor, stating thnt she had
a fascination for the sea. While In charge
of toe Chief of Police here she begged
most piteously not to be sent to her home
In Rallard. but to be allowed to ship as
cook or stewardess on one of the vessels
in this port. She belongs to one of the.
pioneer families of Pugot Sound and is
highly respected, and her strang-e freak
is unaccountable to her friends and rela
tives.

accord with our dignity as a people, or
in accordance with the rights of the peo
ple 10 say because a great corporation is
organized that therefore It should be per
mitted to go Into the field of a new cor
poration, undersell it until it bankrupts
it, raising the money by higher prices
somewhere else. I do not think it is neces
sary for us to do that. I haveonlysuggest
ed a plan. It may not he the best plan.
If you have anything better propose it.
If there is any amendment that you can
think of that will improve it suggest it.
I am arxious to accept anything.
Let me suggest one other thing that I
believe will be a step in the right direc
tion. The great trouble has been that
while our platforms denounce corpora
tions corporations control the elections
and place under obligation to them the
men who are elected to enforce the law.
(Applause.)
Cet me propose a remedyâ not a remedy,
but a step. I think, in the right direction.
Let the laws. State and national, make it
a penal offense for any corporation to
contribute to the campaign fund of any
political party. (Continued cheers arid ap
plause, i Nebraska has such a law. passed
two vrars at;o. Such a law was passed,
or was introduced, in the State of New
York, but so far it has not reached the
stage of actual law in the State of New
York. <Laughter. >
Now, I believe it is a step in the right
direction. You remember the testimony
takf-n before a Senate committee a few
years ngn, when the head of the sugar
trust testified that the sugar trust made
it its business to contribute to campaign
funds, and when ;isked to which it con
tributed It replied that it depended upon
circumstance.-;. "To which one do you
contribute in Massachusetts?" was asked.
"To the Republican fund." "To which
fund in New STork?" "To the Democratic
fund." "To what fund in New Jersey?"
and the man says. "W>ll, I will have to
look at the books; thnt is a doubtful
State." (Continued laughter and ap
plause.)
Now, that is almost a literal reproduc
tion of the testimony of one great cor
poration on the subject of campaign con
tribution. I do not mean to say that that
remedy would be a complete one. but 1
believe that if you prevent a corporation
from contributing to campaign funds
you take a step In the right direction
toward better legislation, because some
corporations are compelled to contribute.
They are blackmailed into contributions,
and such a law would protect a corpora
tion that did not want to contribute and
also prevent a corporation from contrib
uting that did .want to contribute. If
the people are in earnest they can do it,
and you can never do anything in this
country until the people are In earnest,
and when the American people under
stand what the monopoly question means
I believe that there will be no power,
political, financial or otherwise, to pre
vent the people from taking possession
of every branch of the government from
President to the Supreme Court and mak
ing t?ie Government responsible to thÂ©
people's will. (.Great cheers and ap
plau.- .)
At the conclusion of Colonel Bryan's
address Bourke Cockran arose and
started to speak from his seat in the
hall, but in response to cheers and calls
to "Come to the front," he took the
platform. Mr. Cockran said in part:
Just one moment while I express my
complete concurrence In much that Mr.
Bryan has said. If there be a monopoly
that oppresses, I believe that there is no
constitutional limitation, there is no pro
vision of government, there is no power
on earth against these people redressing
a wrong when it becomes a wrong.
The question to which I think the at
tention of this conference should be di
rected Is whether this one exists and
where It is.
Now, who is hurt and where? Where
has this octopus got possession of some
body? On whom is it acting? Where is !
its lair? I am free to confess that when
you call an aggregation of capitalâ a com
binationâa hydra-headed monsterâ an oc
topusâit don't cast any light upon It that
illumines my pathway. 1 can understand
how the use of these phrases can have i
some effect, as nothing frightens people I
so much as incomprehensive names. Let i
a noise be hÂ«-arcl now that none of us
understand and we will all be looking out
of the windows.
Now, men can be put to intellectual and
physical rtigtit by the terrifying noises of
sound. What is that we hear? Are we
doing pretty well? Well, we have had
here reports of labor organizations who
have been telling us that wages are
higher to-day than they ever have been.
Certainly they do not seem to Butter. We
are told that it is not the dollar that we
want, but we want the man. Well, what
is the purpose of the dollar if not to
improve the condition of the man?
i Laughter.)
If you want competition, must not some
body succeed In it? Will you suppress the
man because he excels another so far that
he constitutes a monopoly? Are you go-
Ing to place, limits upon excellency? We
seem to have drifted Into an atmosphere
of bigness concerning what Is called the
evil of monopoly. Now there has been, no
evil given that has been attributed to
monopoly here, against which, if it exist
ed, I would not be entitled under the ban
ner of those to suppress it. If It be an
evil thingâ if you can show evil upon it â
I do not hesitate to adopt Mr. Bryan's
remedy.
If you point out to me, as Mr. Bryan did
this "morning, the fact that we have not
Been the evils of this monopoly yet, why,
then. I say, you are simply creating a
fanciful picture; your excessive affection
for your fellows has conjured a grade of
evils" that exist only in your brain.
If we realize for the moment that this
is an age of improvement, that the condi
tions of men are growing better and bet
ter, we ought to hesitate a while before
we change to take the side, maybe, for
one of fanciful experiments.
Great cheering greeted the conclu
sion of Mr. Cockran'a speech. General
discussion was then resumed. Ex-Sen
ator Blair of New Hampshire and
William Wirt Howe of New Orleans
read short papers. Soon after, on the
motion of Congressman John W. Gains
of Tennessee, the conference passed a
vote of thanks to the Civic Federation
for the courtesy shown the visiting
delegates.
The conference then adjourned sine

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 16.-
The announcement of the decision of the
Supreme Court holding that Mrs. Stan
ford must pay an inheritance tax of near

State of California aroused considerable
anxiety in university circles to-day. Manx

WILL VOTE FOR
MUNICIPAL GAS
A Special Election at

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CLARA, Sept. 16.â The question
of voting $30,000 worth of bonds for the
construction of municipal gas works Is tc
be decided at a special election in this
city next Wednesday. Great Interest is
being manifested in this question, for If
the proposition carries It will be the first
gas works to pass under municipal owner
ship in this State-
All of the heaviest taxpayers of the
town, with the exception of two or three,
are open in their advocacy of the project.
The Hoard of Town Trustees has made a
canvass of the town and has secured
promise of a gas consumption sufficient
to pay the operating expenses and also
the Interest and annual installment of the
bonded debt.
At present the San Jose Light and
Power Company partially supplies the
town, charging $2 76 per thousand feet
when used for lightingpurposes and J2 25
when used for fuel. This company has
interested itself to defeat the proposition
Yesterday It caused anonymous circulars
to be distributed, wherein it was charged
that the Town Trustees were favoring the
project because they would have a large
sum of money to handle. Inasmuch us
thlÃ city has always been free from
charges of municipal corruption and mis
management, such statements have
aroused the greatest indignation.
The Town Trustees are the moat promi
nent citizens and represent property in

one-tenth of the entire assessment roll.
The outlook now Is that the project will
earn' by a big vote, the anonymous cir
culars having had a reactionary effect.

) a collegiate education. He was uorn in
Hardin County on June 28. 1845. He was
graduated from Centre College in 1559;
studied law and at once entered upon the
practice of his profession. He had early
I taken interest in politics and was a noted
i stump speaker when a boy in his teens.
! So great became his reputation that in
| 1559, before he was of age, he was elect

i not take his seat until his twenty-fifth
birthday. In li-tW he stumped the State

POPE INSTRUCTS
FRENCH CLERGY
Omits All Reference to
Dreyfus Case,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME. Sept. 16.â The Pope's letter to
the French people Is one of the longest
documents his Holiness ever wrote. It
Is written In French and is addressed to
j the Bishops and clergy of France, who
j are given minute instructions in regard
i to the education of the people and their
duties in the matter of charity by means
of spiritual works. especially among
workingmen. There is no allusion to the
Dreyfus affair. An appeal for pacifica
tion of spirit Is an indirect reference.
PARIS. Sept It?.â The anxiously ex
pected encyclical letter of the Pope to the
French people was Issued to-day and will
api.>< ar in to-morrow's edition of the
I'nlverse. It does not refer to the Drey
| fus case, being devoted entirely to the
| duties and mission of the French clergy.
The Pope highly praises their pure lives,
ardent faith and spirit of devotion and
self-sacrifice. He urges them to pursue
scientific studies, which he says are nec
essary to combat the teachings of ag
nostics. Above all he Inculcates obedl
ence to Bishops, and tells them to avoid
public meetings.
The Pope reminds them that he recently
i warned American Catholics to beware of
I innovations tending to replace the prin
i clples of Christian perfection by manners
'â  more or less impregnated with natural
ism. The encyclical highly applauds mod
ern progress and says: "We desire to
wÂ» Icome an increase in the patronage of
sciences and anything else that may con
tribute to augment or spread public pros
! perity. but we add that the wise author
i Ity of the church is necessary in order
j that such progress may efficaciously serve
the cause of God."
FLOODS IN GERMANY.
Izer Rises Rapidly and Part of
Munich Is Overflown.
BERLIN, Sept. 16.â The terrific rain
storms in the whole eastern part of South
ern Germany did great damage. The
temperature dropped almost to the freez
ing point in many localities. Much snow
fell in the Bavarian Alps and even in the
valleys. The Izer rose suddenly. Munich
was overflowed, and in the sports exhibi
tion, held on an Island, most of the
buildings were under water.
Advances made on furniture and planoa, with
or without removal. J.,NooiJtua, 1017-1023 Mission.
Zenas M. Crane and grandson of Zenas
Crane, who a hundred years ago founded
the great paper industry in Western Mas
sachusetts. When IT years old Mr. Crane
â went to work in his father's mills, and
now owns, with his brother Zenas, four
important paper plants on the banks of
the Housatonic. Theye mills are the old
Berkshire, Pioneer, Bay State and Gov
ernment. Since 1579 the firm has manu
factured the bond paper for the National
Government, the first contract then made
by W. Murray Crane having been re
newed annually. Mr. Crane is probably
the richest man in Massachusetts politics.
Alexander Bern Bruce is for the second
time the Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor of Massachusetts. Mr. Bruce comes
with a strong backing from the manufac
turing districts, as he has repeatedly
served as Mayor of Lawrence and has
earned his popularity in the northern part
of the State. He is emphatically a s9lf
made man. He was born in Scotland in
1863, ; ; d ai an early n^-; came to this
country with his parents, living at An
dover until his fifteenth year. At that
age he secured work at the cracker bak
ery of the late Johnathan P. Kent, and
at "1 had worked his way up to the posi
tion of foreman. In l v sl he secured a
partnership in the business and in 1891
became Bole proprietor of what has be
come one of the largest cracker manufac
tories In New England. It Is characteristic
that whfn the news of the Johnstown
disaster reached him Mr. Bruce sent as
a personal contribution a carload of sup
plies from his establishment. Mr. Bruce

GREAT MEN WILL BE ENGAGED
SYMPHONIC CONCERTS RESUMED
BY HIRSCHEELD.
A Great Orchestration of Othello by a
Local Musician â Organization
of Philharmonic Orchestra
Soon Completed.
â¦
A piece of musical news of the utmost
importance to the musical world of Cali
fornia, as well as the United States, la
the report that it is the sense of those in
whose care !s the erection of a great uni
versity to add thereto a conservatory of
niutic the like of which cannot be found
In this country nor In the world. My In
formant says that Signiund Be<?l is to be
called back from London to conduct this
great organization in case the plans do
not require too long for completion and
that the best masters will be engaged for
this purpose. That the idea is a most
excellent one cannot be questioned. No
one with any power of perception Will
deny that California has a great musical
future ahead of it. and those who have
spent some time in investigating the musi
cal history of this coast know what a
tremendous amount of work is accom
plished in this art. It is therefore not at
all probable that the institution of such
a conservatory will be the outcome of the
present movement toward musical pros
perity, which has not been equaled either
in energy or usefulness or rapidity of
progress In any part of the world. The
unmit;ated would -.â¢ally be surprised to
sec the amount of work accomplished by
California musicians.
The news of tic heel's engagement In
Philadelphia has occasioned much dis
cussion a* to the fate of the symphony
concerts. Some maintain that there will
not be any orchestra at all, others con
tend that the concerts are to bo resumed
with a new conductor, but none succeeded
in guessing correctly. Ad a matter of fact
the sympnony concerts will be under
taken by Max HirschfelJ, who intends to
t.-iiarge the Tivoli orchestra for this purr
pose; Knowing the feeling that prevails
. re in favor of Jscheei, Mr. Hirschfeld
will not attempt the heavier works at
first; but will begin with Jigluer pro
grammes, interspersed with operatic mu
se, ar;u will inaugurate what may be
termed a series of popular concerts.
Should there be a demand for a higher
class of music Mr. Hirschfeld will not
li-.-itate to supply the demand. That the
iuea is an t-xceilent one no one who has
the musical welfare of this city at heart
will dispute. It is a most laudable enter-
The work accomplished by the Tlvoll
orchestra speaks much for its excellence,
and there art- sufficiently capable musi
cians hero to create a splendid symphony
orchestra. It has been done before at the
Tivoli. In order to bring such an under
taking to a successful conclusion it re
quires a leader whose energy and ambi
tion do not know any limits^ and whose
industry equals his ability, buch a man
is Mr. Hirschfeld. for whoever accom
plishes the great eat of presenting two
such operas as "Lohengrin" and "Othel
lo" in one week, while rehearsals and
performances are going on at the
same time, is a musician of unlimited re
sources and is bound to succeed. So
symphonic and operatic concerts under
the direction of Max H.'rsehfeld will takÂ«
trie place of Scheel'a symphony concerts.
It is safe to predict a complete success
for these affairs.
The reorganization of the old Philhar
monic orchestra is progressing rapidly. It
is now settled that the members are anx
ious to come together usain. and Her
man Ger.ss will be the conductor. A
meeting will be held next week if possi
ble, and the plans will be announced ere
long.
In commenting upon the performances
at the Tivoli the critics seem to be blind
to one important fact, namely, the or
chestration. When it is known that the
orchestration of "Othello" was written
in this city by a local man and that this
musician worked his arrangement from
a piano tcore which did not contain any
notation aa to the individual instruments,
many a cne acquainted with the beauties
of the orchestration will be surprised ,to
rind such a feat possible. And yet George
Koppitz wrote an orchestration for
"Othello" that is a masterpiece in every
sens*- cf the word. He not only condensed
the score for the limited number of pieces
In the orchestra but he succeeded in get
ting every possible effect for the dra
matic situations. He evidently studied
his score carefully, made himself abso
lutely intimate with the ideas of the com
posers and sketched an orchestration that
will earn him the admiration and reSpect
of all those musicians who honor true
genius. If any one doubts this assertion,
let him go and listen to "Othello" aM
mark well the orchestration.
Great interest is manifested in Miss
Clara Kalisher's concert. A vocalist who
has received the unstinted praise of Mas
senet must certainly be endowed with re
markable talent, and one who passed suc
cessfully the gauntlet of critical ears at
the Paris salons cannot be lightly re
garded. From all appearances Miss
Kallsher has accomplished much during
her studies in Europe, and her friends are
right to expect much of this ambitious
vocalist. ALFRED METZGER.

INDIGNATION
IN GERMANY
Dreyfus Case Excites the
People.
GOVERNMENT PAPERS QUIET
FEEL THE INSULT TENDERED
THE REICHSANZEIGER.
Believe That France Should Have
Paid Some Attention to the
Statements Made by That
Paper.
Copyrights, UH, by the Assoc'ated Press.
BERLIN", Sept. 16.â Though the Qovern
â  ment has taken pains to preserve its
equilibrium the result of the Dreyfus trial
; has tremendously shocked the German
people irrespective of creed and politics.
The bitter insult Implied by the total dis
regard upon the part of the Rennes court
of the Official Relchsanzeiger's declaration
of Dreyfus' innocence 13 deeply felt here.
Owing to the peculiar relations with
France these sentiments have not found
full vent in the press a.vl the Govern
ment organs have even done their best
to smother them. But In conversation the
real filings of the peop!Â». indignation
, and almost contempt are universally and
; freely expressed. A small majority, com
posed of anti-Semites and some Agrarians
1 and conservatives, more or lees approved
j the sentence. The Hamburger Nach
i rlchten, formerly the late Prince Bls
; marck's organ, made itseif their mouth
j piece, asserting repeatedly that the cvi
', cer.ee against Dreyfus this time was no
' more than had previously been made pub
lic and that Dreyfus had been convicted
not for spying for Germany, but for Rus-
Bla, citing a mass of alleged evidence In
! support of this assertion. When th.3
wan disputed and ridiculed by the bulk
'â  of the press the paper said the informa
; tion waÂ£ derived from a source excluding
all doubt of its authenticity and correct
. ness and was corroborated by several
1 competent persons. This view was shared
1 by a number of prominent papers, includ
ing -.he Deutsche Tages Zcitung. the
Staatsburger Zeltung and others. The i
; correspondent here of the Associated '
Press has interviewed a prominent for
eign official, who said:
"The Government wai not surprised at
;h<> conviction of Dreyfus. The Reichs
! anzeiger publication was largely for the
: purpose of depriving the world of the
'â¢ chance of saying Dreyfus had again been
- sentenced Because Germany kept silent.
'. W e postponed the publication until the
i last moment, as we suspected It might
| hurt rather than benefit the accused.
"Regarding the comments of the Ham
: burger Narhrlchten, we think It quite
MkMy the paper is making the statement*
jon good authority. Many well Informed
i per?. : i Dreyfus had Russia, and '
I not Germany, to deal with.
"Concerning the talk of boycotting the
Paris Exposition, it Is not Germany's
: part to put herself In the foreground .n
; such a movement. The official relation*
of France and Germany have not suffered

THE EMPORIUM.
[ eminent to join in any directly unfriend- \
ly steps against France. The best proof
1 that we do not mean to suspend prepara
- for the exposition is that the chief
commissioner, Herr Richter, has Just
started for Paris."
The reported connection of Dreyfus with
Russia 1? also common talk in riiplomntic
circles here, where it finds credence. It
is also stated that evidence of this was
produced a: the secret session at Renr.es,
and Del Casse's hurried visit to St.
i't-tersburg Just before the court-martial
is cited in support of this theory.
On the question of joining to a boycott
public opinion is divided. The big" ma-
I jority favor active participation in the
exposition, while a number of leading and
: influential papers, like the Vissisehe Zei
tung, Frankfurter Zeitung and Tapeblatt,
[ advocate abstention. It is reported that
a lew important firms and several commer
cial associations have declared their in- :
tention to abstain, but these, so far. are
the exception, and not the rule. The bulk I
of influential opinion seems to await the '
action of Germany's principal competitors j
in the commercial race, especially Great j
Britain and the United Srates, and will
be guided thereby.

divisions was a tine sight. But all â â â¢>â 
experts present agreed that such a charge
in actual war and under the same condi
tions would have led to the complete an
nihilation of the whole cavalry. There
was, however, the remarkable fact that
the physical condition and morale of the
troops on both sides remained in tine
shape. in spite of the weather. Only a
few rases of serious illness were reported.
Experts assert that the new tieM artil
lery and automobiles were both found to
be easily transportable. Automobile.-?
henceforth will be regularly used in array
transportation. Some automobiles made
during the night and over unknown roads
from fifty to seventy miles without break
ing down.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of
the maneuvers was that the Fifteenth
! corps, mair.lv recruited in .-vlsace-. fra
i ternized freely with the Thirteenth and
Fourteenth corps, who were from other
parts of the empire.

A PLAIN POLITICAL JOB.
'i â JH". legislative satellites of Dan Burns demand
that an extra session of the Legislature shall be
called, nor to send their patron to the Federal
S< â l.ate via the caucus route, but in order that the
Vrooman street improvement act may be amended
and re-enacted. They fall to weeping and wailing
whenever the subject of streets and sewers is men
tioned. According to them, unless an extra session
is convened to amend this statute there will be no
ny re eclipses of the moon, wheat will not sprout
next year, fruit and grapes will fail, the mines will
peter cvr and the Lord will suspend the transit of
Venus until a more opportune season.
This argument is senile, and is talked and written
for gudgeons. Within a year and three months the
Legislature will assemble in regular session. That is
a very short period. The State has been many a
longer time without a statute under which the con
struction of streets and sewers was compulsory. in
188 l the Supreme Court declared the street law of
1876 unconstitutional, and it was not until 1885 that
an act was passed providing a practicable method of
carrying on public work. In the interim streets and
Â«ewrrs throughout the State were built by the people
by private contract. The same thing may be done
now. There is nothing to prevent property-owner^
who desire to improve their property from calling in
a contractor and ordering him to build according to
legal specifications, in which event the work will be
accepted by the government.
But even if this were not all gospel truth, the fact
remains that the Supreme Court has not yet declared
the Vrooman act unconstitutional. Our Mexican
ifeliow citizens may have a fear that when the case of
the Petaluma Paving Company gets before that
tribunal some such a catastrophe will happen; but
to all intents and purposes the Vrooman act is still
â¢in force. Moreover, in the case of Hornung vs.
McCarthy, decided on the Bth inst., the court ex
pressly dodged the point raised in the Petaluma case
and held a street assessment under the Vrooman act
valid and enforceable. Nor was the constitutional
issue raised in the latter case overlooked. A certi
fied copy of the decision of the United States Supreme
Court in the case of Norwood vs. Baker comprised
a part of the record.
McCarthy was the owner of a lot on a hill in South
San Francisco. Under the Vrooman act the Super
visors cut a street through the eminence and assessed
the cost, according to the "front foot" plan, upon the
adjacent prop'"-'.;.-. McCarthy was deemed to have
been damaged to the extent of $1500, but he was a.-,
sessed for "benefits" nearly five times that sum. He
was consequently left with a lot forty feet in the air
and a bill to pay amounting to more than the value
of his property.
If ever there was a horrible example of the uncon
stitationality of the '"front foot" method of street as
sessment here was one. Yet the Supreme Court held
the proceedings valid on the ground that McCarthy
should have brought an injunction to restrain the
work Having remained quiescent while the con
tractor executed the improvement and paid for ir,
the court thought it was not constitutional to pick
the latter's pocket by the indirect process of a law
suit.
Why will not the court take the same view of other
cisc; which come up under the ruling of the Federal
tribunal in Norwood vs. Bnker? Jf it does so. what
necessity is there for calling the Legislature together
to amend the Vrooman act? Street improvement
and sewet building will go on until injunctions are
procured to stop them, and if the injunctions are sus
tained what harm can result? True, a few streets
may remain unimproved and a few sewers may not
be built until iooi. but in all cases where the property^
owners permit the work to actually commence they
will have to pay the bill.
All this makes it clear that the demand of our
Mexican fellow-citizens for an extra session of the
Legislature is a political job. Will they with this
transparent argument be able to pull the wool over the
eyes of the people? We shall see.
THE SUPREME COURT.
THE new charter for this city is before the Su
preme Court for a final judicial interpretation
of it 6 validity. Reasonable men who favored
and reasonable men who opposed the charter see in
this a very necessary policy. To start a city govern
: ment on a new fundamental law in uncertainty of its
constitutionality would of necessity cripple admin
istration and nullify the reformatory object for which
the charter was made. When new constitutions are
made for States, under legislative provision and by
the act of a solemn convention, ratified by the peo
ple and established in the ballot-box, they are still
subject to judicial consideration, and if they fail to
square with the Federal constitution in any particu
i lar they are to that extent set aside by the courts.
| So, also, if in the process of their construction there
1 have been substantial failures in complying with the
law providing for amendment or substitution, the
courts detect such failure in time to prevent the re
organization of a government upon an invalid founda
tion.
The new charter of this city makes wide and acute
changes in administration honestly intended to better
it and to be in the public interest. While opinions
may differ as to their competency to secure the end
in view, there is no difference in the ascription of
virtuous intention in the instrument itself, therein
reflecting the public spirit and good purpose of its
framers.
It is before the final court to receive its judgment
in all particulars that go to its validity as the organic
law of a great city. When that judgment is pro
nounced our people will show forth their good citi
7cnship by cheerful acquiescence. While this spirit
is abroad and controls the purpose of the masses of
our people the Examiner is pursuing a course cal
culated to dilute and weaken the effect of a favorable
decision by raising the presumption that the court
can be or must be influenced in such decision by
swaggering threats and the fear of popular execra
tion.
Falsely creating a condition that does not exist, that
paper begins by saying that "busybodies who assume
to speak for the Supreme Court on the outside are
on the streets whispering intimations that tfie court
is preparing to set aside the San Francisco charter."
Having by. falsehood laid a foundation, the Exam
iner proceeds to say: '"The Supreme Court will not
dare to set aside the results of a popular election hon
estly conducted, as every man knows the charter and
; Freeholder elections were conducted. It was the will
of the people openly and honestly declared. No, the
1 Supreme Court will not throw out the charter.
There are limits beyond which men who mean to live
in California will not care to go."
Installing a pretext by falsehood, the Examiner pro
ceeds to misrepresent the legal points involved, as
suming that the case turns upon the honesty of two
elections, and that the court "will not dare" to set
aside the charter or any part of it, because it was the
result of a popular election! That is to say tint
though the charter might contravene, directly, pro
visions in the State or Federal constitution, though
it might deprive any one of rights entrenched in
those instruments, the Supreme Court will not dare
to say so because the P2xaminer will thereupon make
it impossible for the Justices to live in California!
Tiic history of American journalism affords a no
more flagrant interference with the independence and i
authority of a court than tins.
If the mere fact of adoption of an organic act or
a fundamental law by popular vote puts the instru
ment where courts dare not interpret it, our system
of government is at an end. Then State constitutions
may nullify the Federal constitution, to be in turn
nullified themselves by the charters of their own sub
- ordinate municipalities, and symmetry and order will
disappear and popular liberty and the rights of per
son and property wilf follow. The attitude of the
Examiner, then, is strictly revolutionary, and sets up
a rule of action that ends all stability in government.
It would make the administration of an American
i State as willful and uncertain as that of the turbulent
| countries of Central and South America, and far less
'â  orderly than the aboriginal government of an Indian
tribe. Under the pretense of devotion to good gov
; ernmentj it proposes an intolerable system destruc
tive of all government. Worst of all, it shadows and
dilutes a decision favorable to the charter with the
idea that the court did not dare decide otherwise for
; fear of an outbreak which would exile its members
from the State or outlaw them within its borders!
The Examiner cannot now support the validity of
â  the charter, if affirmed by the court, on the ground
; that such affirmation speaks the judicial mind and is
! derived by application of the rules of legal interpre-
I tation, but because the judgment utters only the fear
of the court and is rendered under threat and moral
duress.
We put the case calmly to lawyers and laymen
â  alike and ask them to consider the consequences of
such judicial rule as the Examiner proposes to insti
; tute. It is simply subversive of society and its insti
j tutions. If acted upon, or if there arise a suspicion
that a court is subject to it. chaos takes the place of
i law and confusion substitutes system. All over this
! State men and organizations are working together
i for the greatening of our materialities. Our attractive
i phylactery is spread like a banner of enterprise to lure
. a thrifty population to come and put its property and
' its profits under the shelter of our laws and the pro
tection of our courts. But what prudent man will
subject his family and his gains to the annihilation of
I rights which must everywhere closely follow the pol
! icy by which the Examiner proposes to abolish ju
! dicial protection and independence and substitute
j them with dynamite and the bludgeon?
We are painfully aware of the effect of such a publi
' cation upon certain unthinking elements and indi
| vidual minds. The thoughtless have ever been the
j beneficiaries of the thoughtful, to whom the world
I owes the careful and majestic architecture of that sys
i tern of judicial guardianship which has made owner
\ ship of property as safe to the weak as to the strong.
I That system can only exist while the judiciary is free
and safe to apply to all issues joined the principles
of the science of the law. Yet here, at the very begin
i ning and germ of our whole constitutional scheme of
government, it is demanded that a court shall abdi
cate its independence, shut its eyes to judicial inter
pretation and let fear for its physical safety be the
sole motive for decision in a matter which is at the
origin of all government! The impression upon th'it
thoughtful class of minds which are the final cause
of public opinion must reveal the danger of letting
j such a threat and its brazen infamy go unrebuked.
The gentleman of Keswick who shot the top of his
friend's head off in a controversy over a mine appears
to have acted somewhat hastily. The courts have de
cided that the mine belonged neither to the murdered
man nor to the murderer.
The State authorities of health intend to begin a
vigorous crusade against consumptives. Los Angeles
may take it as an invidious attack upon its resources
by politicians.

seems to have gone beyond his depth in mingling
with gentlemen. At the Sacramento State Fair he
gave every necessary evidence of the fact that his
sphere of usefulness was rightly chosen when he de
termined to confine his energies to the consideration
of insect pests.
RECEPTIONS TO THE VOLUNTEERS.
SO far as the general public is concerned the re
ceptions given by the city to the volunteers re
turning from the Philippines culminated in the
grand pageants and brilliant illuminations which at
tended the welcome to the Californians. All that has
followed has seemed in the nature of an anti-climax,
and comparatively little attention is given to it.
It is of course natural that this should be so. The
enthusiasm and the interest of the people mounted
rapidly from the time when the first of the volun
teers returned until the day when our own boys came
back and then overflowed in an exuberance of re
joicing in that week of festivals. The inevitable re
| action has followed, and comparatively few people
take note of the fact that the receptions are still
going on as each successive regiment returns, and
that the courtesies and the hospitality of the city are
extended by the committee with undiminished hear
tiness and liberality.
By the economy with which it managed the grand
I displays of welcome to the California troops the com
mittee has on hand a surplus to continue the recep
tions to the troops of other States as they arrive. As
fast as they come they find a welcome waiting them.
They are greeted with music and are entertained at the
theaters, and other forms of hospitality are shown
them. The committee, in fact, continues to discharge
its duties with as much zeal and energy as it did when
the subject was a matter of universal interest an-1
when all eyes were upon it.
It is said that several men who went to the mining
town of Anvil to practice law and medicine are now
using the pick and shovel with commendable cheer
fulness and some success. A few estimable gentle
men nearer home might respect the eternal fitness
of things and follow suit.
The dispatches announce that the Filipino con
gress has become disheartened. The determination
with which the military progress of General Otis is
resisted indicates very clearly that the germ of dis
content has not yet entered the Filipino army.
IT lias long been known that enough flood water
flows back to the sea in our rainy seasons to more
than triplicate the Stated resource for irrigation.
The aiiirmation by the courts of riparian rights and
their modification by some rights of prior appropria
tion lay only upon the average normal flow of the
streams. The Hood waters are not subject to any of
the limitations upon their use that stand around the
usual flow.
Therefore, it has been felt that if some system is
workable whereby the flood waters can be impounded
and saved from waste, leaving the average carriage
of the streams to those whose right to it is confirmed
by the law, not only would many distressing disputes
and costly lawsuits be obviated, but the arable area of
; the State would be finally extended to cover all land
that can be made fruitful by a proper service of water.
We are looking to a great extension of our commerce
and are already in enjoyment of its first fruits, buz,
after all, commerce depends upon the production of
all those things which enter into profitable exchange.
Increase in our marketable production is increase in
our commerce. That production is limited to the
amount of water available for irrigation. It may not
all be always needed. The rainfall may obsolete its
use sometimes, but, after all, stability of commerce
! depends upon stability of production, and this can
bs assured in California only by having always at
hand and ready for distribution a sufficient volume of
water for irrigation. The only source of this is in
the efficient storage of the flood waters, which other
wise waste.
An attempt is of long standing to have this done
by the Federal Government, but so far no appre
ciable headway is made. The trouble with Federal
?.Lt ; on is that it implies, primarily, the expenditure of
public money, and the Government, being a political
corporation, is controlled by a majority of its stock
holders â that is to say, of its voters. That majority
is planted where men farm without invoking Federal
aid in anything, and they cannot be brought to sec
why others 6hould have it in the same vocation. This
exertion of the power of the majority throws the
question of flood water storage back upon the State â â 
at least as far as California is concerned.
The vast and numerous interests affected, running
from the miners to the horticulturists, have organ
ized to suggest and secure some plan by which the
State can impound these flood waters and provide
for their equitable distribution. If this can be done
the future of this State is made alluring.
The State Board of Trade and the California
I Press Association have emphasized the necessity of
| the proposed work by putting at the disposition of the
new organization a sufficient sum of money to in
itiate its work, and it is proposed to hold a State
convention to crystallize the plan and prepare the
legislation required.
No more important economic matter is now be
fore our people, and there is no doubt that it will get
the attention and support which it deserves.
The good people of Santa Rita are nothing if not
deliberate iq estimating consequences. They have
finally arrived at the conclusion that an eleven-year
old boy who attempted to kill three playmates and
then stole a horse is likely to become a criminal if his
career is not checked.
RIVALRY IN THE TWIN CITIES.
RTVALRY between St. Paul and Minneapolis is
so keen that a stroke of newspaper enterprise
in one city is immediately followed by a clever
counter stroke in the other. Thus when the Minne
apolis Times made a fine showing by taking the fron
tispiece of The Call's volunteer reception edition, fend
using it as an illustration in announcing the arrival of
the Minnesota boys from the Philippines, merely sub
stituting the name "Sheridan" for "Sherman" on the
transport, the Pioneer Press of St. Paul proceeded to
get even by reproducing from that same edition of
The Call the picture of the naval parade, making,
of course, the change in the name of the transport.
Enterprise which follows in the lead of The Call
and profits thereby to the extent of giving a wider
enjoyment of our artistic iflustrations is to be com
mended, but it should be accompanied by more care
than was exercised by either of the rival journalists
in this case. We regret to note that in changing the
name of the transport each of them forgot to give
credit to The Call for the original pictures. If the
Times will now direct the attention of Minneapolis
to the misdeeds of the St. Paul journalist and the
Pioneer Press will point out to the people of St.
Paul the wrong of the Minneapolis newspaper justice
will be done and all forgiven.
UTILIZING FLOODS.
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
The man on the street In the United
- States has gone wild on a good many
occasions and from a wide variety of
causes in my time, but he has never
: been quite so hysterical as over
â  the conviction of Dreyfus. I can
; remember when he wished to have
Congress hurl defiance at Bismarck
because of what he called "the i
I persecution of Yon Arnim"; I recall
: ! the vigor with which he urged the
I President to demand of Victoria the |
immediate release of Mrs. Maybrick; â 
but in neither of thoÃe instances was !
the man on the street quite so uproar- '
iously furious as he is at present. Two j
â j or three of him the other night
i | threatened to close up one of our best- :
| known restaurants because the musi- '
cians of the place started to play the !
1 "Marseillaise." Others of him insist
i upon a general boycott of everything
. ; French and would have us all Jforswear ;
a visit to the Paris Exposition of 1900. j
Such performances and demands are
intended to show that the man is a j
friend of humanity and a lover of jus
tice, but the effect is very different j
, ! from the intention. For my part I am j
! inclined to believe the men who are so '
! eager to have Paris boycotted are sim- j
I ply a lot of impecunious fellows who j
won't be able to attend the exposition
themselves and don't like any one else
!to go. To stay away from France for
the sake of "avenging Dreyfus" would :
not be logical, nor would it help Drey- '
fus, but it sounds well to persons who
think if the Parisians should happen to
miss us they would feel hurt and be >,
sorry.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The innocence of Dreyfus Is pro
claimed by "the civilized world" that â 
didn't hear or read the evidence, and
his guilt has been pronounced by two :
sets of "prejudiced and degenerate
! scoundrels" who did hear the evidence. !
I Such is the statement of the case gen- j
j erally made on the street. On that j
I showing a man of reasonable coolness
will at least reserve judgment enough
to avoid hysteria. That an innocent
man should be condemned by villains
in high office is no doubt very bad, but i
why condemn all France, French music j
and French expositions?
The advocates of Captain Carter,
whose case is one of some celebrity In
our own country, assert his innocence
as vigorously as ever that of Dreyfus
has been asserted. They maintain he
j was unjustly convicted by a court-
I martial composed of eminent officers of
! our army and that his persecution and
condemnation were brought about by
a conspiracy on the part of a giant
corporation whose iniquity he was
about to expose. Suppose the French
; should take ud the Carter case and i
! boycott us? Suppose they should say j
! no American goods shall be exhibited
; at their exposition and no American be
j permitted to Bee thHr "Midway Plai
jsance"? Th^n, indf-od, there would be
occasion for hysteria and the man on
the street could have full liberty to
dance a war dance and disturb the de
corum of our public resorts at his
] pleasure. Until that happen, however,
the Dreyfusard should be abated a lit
tle. It isn't our year for a revolution.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Here are a few extracts from an ac
count of a religious meeting by a
writer in a recent issue of the New
York Tipes: "As we entered the room
an order was given in a stern voice to
all fall on their faces and pray. Being
unused to the customs I knelt at a
: chair and was surprised to hear shouts
I while the prayer went up to humble
I the proud spirit of the woman who was
kneeling. Looking around I discovered
I was the only one not with my face on
the floor, so I got down rather than
create a scene. * * After the pray
ing had gone on for a short time the
leader jumped to his feet and shouted
! that the devil was present in the room
I and that God would not listen to his
I prayers. 'I will go to the turret and
talk with God and find out what the
trouble is.' As he said this he walked
out of the room, stepping on the pros
trate forms on the floor on his way to
the hall."
That sounds like a description of
some abomination of Buddhism in Asia
or fetish worship in Africa, but it isn't.
It is an account of the way a certain
class of our fellow countrymen of the
good old State of Maine carry on the
religious observances of Christianity.
Had such a scene occurred in Frarce it
would be easy to class it among the
I roofs of the degeneracy of the race,
but as it is we shall have to let it go
ucclaesed and call it "zeal."
Ry way of contrast to the perfervic!
drvttion of the revivalists of Maine, it
is worth noting the cool and perfunc
tory way in which camp meetings are,
sometimes at least, conducted in Geor
gia. At the close of such a meeting in
that State a short time ago a sot of res
olutions of thanks were adopted by a
rising vote. The resolutions contained
| eight clauses after the preamble, each
of which gave thanks to some particu
lar person or set of persons: and the
last two, according to the report given
in the Atlanta Constitution, run thus:
"Seventhâ To the railroad for the re
duced rate of one and a third fare for
round trip to persons attending the
meeting.
'Eighthâ To Almighty God, the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for call
ing so many of his people together,
and meeting with them in power and
demonstration."'
To give thanks to a railroad company
and to God in one set of resolutions
and in the same form may not be the
height of decorum and dignity, but it is
better than the practice in Maine of
lying down to let an evangelist walk
over your prostrate body. Such is my
opinion. If, however, any one think
differently he has a right to rejoice
that he can think at all. In matters of
religion in a free country it is not de
sirable there should be either conform
ity or uniformity.
â¢ â¢ â¢
It is well known that President Kru
j ger of the Transvaal Is a profoundly
! religious man, and it will be remem
bered that a few weeks ago he advised
the British officials to read certain
Psalms for the edification of their
minds on the subject of their strife
with him. It is not so well known,
however, that Cecil Rhodes, the great
opponent of Kruger, is also a devout
man serving the Lord diligently after
his manner. He recently made a speech
at the laying of the cornerstone of a
Presbyterian church at Woodstock,
near Cape Town, and it is thus reported
in the Westminster Gazette:
"He remembered when the Bishop of
Deny was out here, and was staying
I with him. On the Sabbath the Bishop
said to him. "I suppose you are com
ing to hear me at Rondebosch
Church?" and Mr. Rhodes said, "No,
sir, I have got my own chapel." The
Bishop said. "Where is it?" and he re
plied, "It is up the mountain." The
fact was. if he might take them into
j his confidence, that he did not care to
go to a particular church on one day in
the year when he ftsed his own chapel
at all other times. He found that up I
i that mountain one got thoughts â what
j they might term religious thoughts, be
i cause they were thoughts for the bet
! terment of humanity, and he believed
I that was the best description of relig
i ion â to work for the betterment of hu

Going to a mountain to get thoughts
for the betterment of humanity is good
; exercise, but Mr. Rhodes should have
i remembered that Satan's plan of
: temptation has been known to include
taking one to the pinnacle of a moun
| tain, showing him all the surrounding
i country and offering him the kingdom
|if he would bow down. Is Mr. Rhodes
| quite certain that when from the top of
| his favorite mountain he looks over
' into Kruger's country, he has always
i said with firmness: "Get thee behind
me, Satan"?

In these days when the discontented
are doing so much of the talking it is
pleasant to know there is one man of
; a cheerful disposition and easily satis- j
! fled, who has sufficient rank in the j
world to compel attention when he ]
wishes to say something, and sufficient
| good humor to say something comfort-
I ing when he has attention. That happy
j personage is the Czar of Russia, and
', he has been pleased to notify the rra
-1 tions that he is satisfied with the re
! suits of the Peace Conference. In their
j note the Ministers who represented
him at the conference and who speak
for him say:
"It has been found necessary for the
conference to postpone a definite set
tlement of the complicated question of
the suspension of armaments until
fully elucidated by the different Gov
ernments. Nevertheless," they add,
"the lightening of military burdens is
already admitted by unanimous reso
lution to be urgently desirable for all
nations."
Language of that kind from such a
source is charming. The babblers of
the world have been complaining that
the conference accomplished nothing,
and judging from their reports it would
be supposed a man who was pleased j
with the results wouldn't be discon- 1
tented if he stuck a nail in his foot.
Now comes the man who called the ;
conference and he tells his people they I
got their moneys worth. Surely it is |
better to be a Czar and have a contented :
mind than to be a critic and have j
nothing but an inclination to be un- |
happy; better to be satisfied with even \
so windy a thing as a "unanimous !
resolution" than not to be satisfied at j
all.

A lurid contemporary which pub
llshed last Sunday a full page account of
alleged bacchanalian revels and drunken ;
orgies at a resort where good folks I
spend the summer and musical young '
men sing eweet songs to the maiden j
moon apologized later on by declaring j
the publication was an "inadvertence." i
As the style of the article was even >
more highly colored than the many- j
hued gaud of a picture that illustrated j
it, the apology has been received with j
hesitation. If the paper had frankly j
admitted that the whole "colored sup
plement" was a mental aberration, the
explanation would have been sufficient
and satisfactory.

That Voltaire was right in defining
history as "a fable agreed upon" has â¢
been proven anew by a fresh illustra
tion of the difficulty of learning the ex*
act truth concerning even contempo- j
rary events. The Society of Architect- j
ural Iron Manufacturers of New York
determined a short time ago to erect
a tablet commemorating the inventor
of what is known as "skeleton con- i
struction" now so frequently used in
the larger structures in our cities; but
when they set about the work they,
found half a dozen claimants for the
honor and the advocates of each cited
some particular building as the earliest '
example of the construction which has
revolutionized architecture and made
the skyscraper possible. Such a dis
pute would appear to be easy of solu
tion, but it isn't. The more the subject
is investigated the farther back can the
system be traced. It was used in Lis- !
bon after the great earthquake, ac- j
cording to good authorities, and before !
the controversy is over we shall prob- j
ably have some antiquarian inform us
it was used at the Tower of Babel.
Meantime a pretty little side dispute i
has cropped out. Chicago avers it is j
Impudence on the part of New York to i
erect a tablet for such a purpose and I
vehemently claims the first skyscraper ;

That spirit of the age which moves
men to join with one another andorgan
ize clubs, unions, leagues, societies, as
sociations and combinations of all sorts i
has been potent in this country, but
even more potent in Great Britain. So
numerous and so strong have the va
rious organizations become in that
kingdom the people who do not belong
to one or more of them are in danger
of being crowded off the island. Hence
there has arisen a burly British oppo
sition to the spirit, and as a result there
has been started in Birmingham a new
secret society which is called the
"Anti-Association Defense League."
The promoters of the movement style
themselves "friends of liberty," but in
asmuch as their mode of fighting asso
ciations consists in forming another as
sociation and making it a secret order,
the advantage of joining them is not
clear. The fact that such a combina
tion has been started, however, is a
sign of the times and an intimation ot
what we are coming to. We have
learned in this country that the best
way to fight a trust is to start an oppo
sition trust, and it appears we shall
have to keep on with the movement
until everybody and every industry are
included in one gigantic trust and then
there will a happy and spontaneous so.
lution of all problems by the inevitable
ending of all in one big bust.
For some time past reports from the
Eastern summer resorts have informed
us of the alarming extent to which
both men and women are becoming ad
dicted to the habit of going about with
out hats. The practice began, it ap
pears, with college oarsmen, thence it
passed to all kinds of boating: people
and afterward to cyclists, and now it i a
said to be a common sight to see youns
men and women of style and stuff rid
ing, driving, promenading and playing
golf hatless, bonnetless, capless; cov
ered as to the heads of them with noth
ing but their own hair.
It is claimed for the fad that a hat
is a nuisance; that it conceals rather
than adorns the dignity of the human
head; that it tends to produce baldness,
engenders colds, is difficult to keep in
place when exercising In a breeze, and
is an old-fashioned custom which it
were well to get rid of. It will be noted
that nothing is said about the Influ
ence of a hat upon the talk of him who
wears It, and from that fact the con
clusion will be readily drawn that the
fad is founded upon reason and not
flippancy.
It is hardly likely the new practice
will be continued through the shocks
of winter, but there are a good many
decent men with a proper regard for
thHr wives who would be glad to see it
revive next spring just before Easte*-.
In the meantime the promptness of the
girls in adopting the style may be cited
as another evidence of feminine per
versity. It took forty laws to compel
the belles to take off their hats in a
theater where the public prefers the
hatless woman, but now without any
law or logic they forswear hats alto
gether just for the sake of following,
the boys. *

MEXICO'S RATAL
DAY CELEBRATED
IN GRAND STYLE
Natives of Southern
Republic Rejoice.
The sons and daughters of old V
ad their descendants turned out
in vast numbers last night to cele
brate the eighty-ninth anniversary
ndence of the souther:! re
public. They swarmed into Odd Fel

The hall was literally ,
jammed, men, women an : h â¢:. be-
in like sardines in a box.
those who arrived early were
able to secure seats, but those who
were compelled to star.d con gram
even that
; â  .
rienced by ail was
feeling of patriotic exultation that per- .
vaded the assemblage.
Over the -â¢ â - the flag of Mexico was
entwined with Old Glory, while around
the gallery rail colored bunting was
gracefully festooned. The exercises, as
Is customary, consisted of a literary
and musical entertainment, followed
by a grand ball, but th..- year the lit
erary and musical part of the pro
gramme had been prepared with un
usual care, a fact that was manifest
the moment the curtain rolled up and
revealed the grand chorus seated, row
upon row, in semi-eircuiar formation,
a dozen or bo seats in the center of the
arch being occupied by the officers
and the speakers. The arrangement
resembled In appearance nothing so
much as a minstrel first part, but
there the resemblance ceased.
After an overture by the orchestra
President Charles Baez presented Hon.
A. K. Coney, Consul General of ilex- j
ico, as honorary president of the day. j
Secretary A. de la Torre read the act
of independence proclaimed by Mexico
when she severed her allegiance front
Spain, and the orchestra played ' In
dependencia," which was enthusiasti
cally cheered. This constituted the
"Instalacion de la Junta Patriotica,"
and the celebration was on In earnest.
Ramon Garcia, the orator of the day.
delivered an address that teemed with
eloquence and arc-used the vast audi
ence to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.
The only other speakers were Mayor
Phelan and L. A. Campbell, who made
brief addresses appropriate to the occa- ,
sion in English.
A ran dance by Nina Gertrudis Xar
vaez was very prettily executed and
brought its reward in the shape of gen
erous applause and magnificent bou
quets of flowers from admirers in the
audience. Solos were sung by Miss M.
Dagnin, Mrs. Brigida Caraarena, Miss
Nellie O'Rourke, Mrs. Laura de George |
and Miss Justina Perez. Miss O'Rourke J
sang the "Star-spangled Banner" to an
orchestra accompaniment in a manner
that brought down the house. The
other soloists were accc-mpanied on the
piano by M. A. Ohlmeyer and Mrs.
Lamkin. and all were the recipients of
beautiful floral offerings. Miss Celsa '
Rivero recited a poem, and a very j
pretty trio was rendered by Miss Emily
Lassale, Miss Blanche Blanc and Miss
Jennie Lassale, accompanied on the
piano by Mrs. C Lassale Vauthier. As
a fitting climax to the entertainment
the Mexican national hymn was ren- j
dered. The four stanzas were sung re
spectively by Miss Leonor Balleto, Mrs.
Laura de George. Miss Josephlna Mesa
and Mrs. Brigida Camarena. The
chorus was beautifully rendered by the
following:
Misses Edna Adams, Jessie Dusen
berry, Lucy Coffey, Jennie Lass

At the conclusion of the literary and
musical programme the floor was
cleared and dancing held sway during
the remainder of the night. The un
qualified success of the celebration was
due to the untiring and intelligent ef
forts of the executive committee, !
which was composed of the following:

The citizens of Colmal the solid j
business men of the town and the own- '

country side, turned out en masse last ''
night, and from the hands of the Buck
ley-Schwartz combination and Its fol- I
lowing of thugs wrested the welfare j

meeting, which was to have been the \
crowning triumph of the touts, was
suddenly and Btartlingly turned Into â 
the strongest of rebukes, and Instead
of discussing Incorporation and pool- j
rooms, the hundred and odd solid tax- ]
payers present turned to the improve- |
ment of their roads and to other thinzs
that would bring greater value to their ;

There has been a mighty opening of ,
eyes in Colma since The Call first
sounded the alarm. The cold facts that
were presented in the opening expose
mted for the sudden and warm in- j
terest Martin Kelly and others of his |
ilk were showing in the little San .

served merely as proof of the alleea

Thornton's temperature dropped into
his boots before the meeting was half ;

Aa on previous occasions, Henry '
"Ward Brown occupied the chair. In i
his opening statement he said nothing
at all of incorporation; on the con

PASSES AWAY II
PRIME OF LIFE
Prominent in Reform
Movements.
Ge^.rsp T. Gaden, a well-known cltt
â  3 o Francisco, died in this city
rday. Mr. Gaden first came into
r.ence through the active interest
-played in municipal reform and
problems. By reason of his knowl
edge of urban affairs he was selected
by the late Mayor Sutro as a confiden
tial secretary and adviser in matters
connected with the. operations of the
I of Supervisors with which Mr.
Sutro was associated. He devoted his
time largely to the watching of street
â¢actors and to exposing the th^n
prevailing methods of defrauding the
city.
As secretary of the Civic Federation
Mr. Gaden did a great deal of hard
work on the lines pursued by that or
ganization, with which were identified
GtOÃGfc T. GADEN.
R^v. Dr. Dille. J. Wesley Reed. I. J.
Truman and others. The Incident in
his career in this city that brought, him
most prominently before the public was
the suit of Dr. Marc Levingston against
Mr. Gaden. Dr. Dille. I. J. Truman and
others for criminal libel.
This action grew out of a set of res
olutions for whi^h the gentlemen

spring morning In 1852, when he first
floated in and settled down on the pres
ent site of Colma, and after dragging it
over every road in the county butted
into the next century on that bLack
day when Colma would wake up to the
fact that she had no sewer system
and no water of her own. and no alms
house "and all," said Mr. Thornton,
"because she never incorporated and
all the other districts in the county had
spent her money on their own roads."
'"Hold on there," interrupted Jim Cai
lanan, who owns and pays taxes on a
lucrative hog ranch, "how much do
these poolroom people pay you to come
in here and talk incorporation?"
Mr. Thornton ignored the unkind in
sinuation of Mr. Callanan, but immedi
ately reverted to the Sao Bruno avenue
project. He was expressing himself
upon th* hopelessness of that plan and
was just about to shoot off another al
lusion to incorporation when he was held
up by Henry Bruhns. who also runs a
hog ranch, who wanted the versatile
agent of Mr. Buckley to explain why he
had been strongly in favor of the San
Bruno route before the incorporation
question had been brought up and was
now so strongly opposed to it.
Chairman Henry Ward Brown re
lieved the embarrassment that resulted
by getting up to deny that he had
ever had affiliation or tickets with any
poolroom. He pointed "with pride
to the fact that at the last Legislature
he had framed a bill against that in
iquity, which had got as far as second
reading when the session was adjourn
ed. He said a whole bunch of real un
kind things about the newspapers and
accused The Call of having alluded to
the citizens of Colma as touts and stew
bums. Henry Bruhns again Interrupt
ed at this point to say that he had
understood the papers to say that Mar
tin Kelly and his crowd were all those
things. Then Mr. Brown got embar
rassed himself and pulled out of his
pocket a bunch of letters and references
on the cost of running a small-sized
town under its own government. Mr.
Thornton saw the point, but steered
clear of it and said he was glad the
road matter had been settled, and as
nobody offered a rousing demonstra
tion for Incorporations and poolrooms

was that of a broker and commission

New Charter Test Case.
The argument in thÂ» charter test case
"f Ml F. Frag'.ey against Mayor Phelan
has been set by the Supreme Court for
Thursday. September 28, at 10 a. m. After
the adoption of the new charter by the
people the Mayor began preparations fo*
an election of city officials under the new
law. Such an election necessarily affects
the tenure of office of the present office
holders, and Superintendent of Streets
Fragley began an Injunction action to
restrain the Mayor from calling the pro
posed election, and this action is to test
the validity of the new charter. Owing
to the importance of the subjects in
-1 it is believed that interesting ar
guments will be made and that the mat
ter will be decided by the court before
very long-.
LYNCH CAUGHT IN
RANK FALSIFICATION
MAYOR PHELAN GIVES HIM THE
LIE DIRECT.
Market-Street Railway Will Be Com
pelled to Use Iron Poles
on Its New Line.
Mayor Phelan yesterday announced his !
disapproval of the resolution recently j
adopted by the Supervisors which gave !
! the Market Street Railway Company per- j
i mission to take iron poles from Kentucky â 
street to be used on the new corkscrew
line. Concerning the false representations
made by Henry Lynch, superintendent of :
1 the company, the Mayor deals at some !
length. His message is as follows:
September S. 1599.
To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San Francisco â
Gentlemen: I herewith return to you without I
my approval resolution No. 3373 (fourth aeries),
granting permission to the Market Street Rail- !
way Company to remove Iron poles on Ken- j
tucky street, on the Mission road and on Vir- !
ginia avenue, and to replace them by tem
porary wooden poles, to be replaced by iron
poles within two years. My objection Is ad
follows:
Iron poles are required on the above named
streets by the franchise granted. The com
pany undertook to remove them without per
mission. When apprehended they then asked
permission of the Board of Supervisors, which
was granted on the ex parte statement of the
superintendent of construction of the company
that they desired to use the Iron poles in com
pleting their railways,- under lranchises grant
ed in the downtown districts, and that they ;
could not procure new Iron poles for eighteen
months.
I find, however, on inquiry, that poles can :
; be secured In this city in three or four months' â 
! time. I had a commercial house, in the regu
i lar course of business, send the following
telegram East: '"Quote price and earliest de- .
livery for 180 electrical railway poles, thirty
feet long, made of five. 8 and 7 inch hydraulic '
pipe five-sixteenths thick, railroad freight." \
The answer came that such poles may be pro- ;
i cured for $33 each f. o. b. cars at San Fran
i cisco for shipment by rail within a mouth.
I. therefore, conclude that the superintend- :
ent's statement was erroneous and calculated
to mislead members of the board, which would
not have granted the permission were this in- \
formation before them.
I desire in every way to facilitate the build- j
ing of the new road, but unless there is some
; great public interest involved I do not be- !
: !iev c that one section of the city should be :
! made to contribute to the benefit of another.
If the company had ordered the poles when :
â  they secured the franchise they would be en ;
th-> ground to-day. 'The price of iron has ad
vanced and I am disposed to believe. in view
of the facts, that this attempt to remove poles
from one part of the city to another, in vio- ;
lation of the franchise, was merely a measure
of small economy. Respectfully submitted.

REPUBLICANS
WILL CAUCUS
ON CANDIDATES
Convention to Meet
October 3.
A CONFERENCE OF LEADERS
MONEY FOR THE CAMPAIGN
WILL BE PRODUCED.
According to announcement, the execu
tive committee of the City Republican
League met in Henry T. Scott's office I
yesterday morning at 9 o'clock. The ses
sion lasted for an hour and a half. Many
topics were discussed, but the one which
engaged the closest attention of the com
miueemen had reference to finance. When
it was clearly demonstrated that money
was needed to carry out the reform pur- :
poses of the organization several men
expressed a readiness to raise the sum
required then and there, but others less
enthusiastic and more prudent suggested
that the burden should be distributed over â 
an area embracing a larger population.
The liberality displayed was accepted as
a sure indication that the money neces
sary to conduct the campaign can be '
readily obtained when it is needed.
The Call ascertains that Henry T.
Scott talked fluently at the conference. â 
His talk was breezy, edifying and enter
taining. In a large hall he might be sub
ject to a little timidity in addressing his .
fellow-citizens, but in his own office,
where he is familiar with his own voice
and his echoes, he speaks without per
6eptib!e embarra-sment or impediment i:i
his speech. Mr. Scott wili be congrat
ulated by his fellow Republicans for the
progress he is making in the domain of
local politics. Mayor Phelan began his
public career by practicing on the Bo
hemian Cub; hence it is not out of place
tor Mr. Scott to practice on the executive
committee. The Mayor is now so profi
cient that he can make a speech at any
time or in any place, and gracefully open
anything from a church fair to a jack pot.
The executive committeemen resolved
that on the evening of September 2a. a:
Bnai B'rith Hall, there should be a cau
cus of the 200 delegates to the Republican
local convention who were elected under
the auspices of the league.
Candidates for Mayor will be consid
ered at the caucus. Names already men
tioned will be submitted to the judgment
of the conference. The caucus will also
consider candidates for Supervisor. Each '
district delegation represented in the cau
eua will be expected to submit five or six
good men who would be willing to serve
on the Board of Supervisors. The discus
sion at yesterday's meeting of the execu- i
tive committee caused the impression that i
the caucus would reserve the right to â¢
name the eighteen' candidates for the j
board. District delegations will be asked
to recommend good men, but if the men i
so recommended do not reach the stand
ard of fitness prescribed by the caucus.
ethers coming up to the standard of qual
ification may be placed on the ticket.
The point is advanced that the judgment
of 200 delegates, comprising the league's
controlling strength in the convention. ;
would be a safer guide than the judgment
of a district delegation. Candidates axe
desired whose good qualities are known
throughout the city. The caucus wili Bet
tie many questions that mifht arise in the
convention and provoke prolonged discus- \
sion. More than one session of the cau
cus may be required to adjust affairs to
the satisfaction of the majority.
Leaders of the league still insist that a
candidate for Mayor, whose strength and
availability will be widely recognized, but .
name has not yet been published
in tfce list of probable nominees, will be
presented to the caucus.
The Republican local convention will be
called to order by Chairman Sheldon G.
Kellogg on Tuesday evening, October 3.
The ticket from top to bottom will be .
complete before Saturday. October 7, as
It must be filed not later than the latter
date.

He Contends That the Securities of

A question of importance Is now before

credit â  â  on. This was in
the I nk < v.se..
A Ruramarj of the brief brings out the
Inent points:
The constitution of California pro
vides that where land Is mortgaged
â  of the mortgage must t>.- do
ducted from tho value of the land,
and th< r. maining value of the land
ed 1 â  ::â ! own* r and I

tinently sskod: "What becomes of the
rule of uniformity and equality which
tnits money in hand to be taxed,
but exempt? it when invested and
brincing in money?"
Again, referring to the deduction nf
made in favor of the
land owner, the Attorney General
says:
"The fact that the framors of the
constitution saw fit to lessen the tax

nia in no manner signifies a like In

PRINTERS' UNION
LOSES A POUT
IN VITAL CASE
Involves Legal Life of
Labor Bodies.
LOST IN THE SUPERIOR COURT
MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL HAS
BEEN DENIED.
Supreme Court Will Be Called Upon
to Pnss Judgment on Precedents
Recently Established by
English Courts.
In the suit of Hess vs. the San Fran
cisco Typographical Union In Judge Daln-
Kerfield's court defendant's motion for a
new trial was denied. The union has ap-
I fmra the former judgment of the
t, and later on will appeal from the
order denying defendant's motion for a
new trial.
The action was brought by Hess against
the union to recover $25,000 damages, and
in his complaint alleges that he was em
ployed on the Bulletin as a linotype ma
chinist in September. 1597, and that de
iis entered into a conspiracy to
compel the Bulletin by means of throats,
strikes and Intimidations to discharge him
nn the grounds th;it he was not a member
of the union. The result was that he was
discharged, but was again employed after
two months, but only for one day,
as the union succeeded in having the Bul
letin discharge him again. Ho was,
through the action of the union, unable
â lire work ai his trade tn San Fran
or any of the larger cities of the
try, hence the suit. Judgment v.is
red in favor of plaintiff for $1200 and

In its appeal tho defendant relies upon
a recent decision of the House of Lords,
England, entitled Allen vs. Flood, re
: in L. K. App. i !as. I 1 1898), decided
in 1897. This case was followed in the
case of Davis vs. Th< I ted Stationary

of New York early in 1898, and reported
In 28 App. Div. iN. V.) :;'."'.. and it was
wed later in the same year by the
Supreme Court of the Dominion of Can
ada In tho case of Perrault vs. Gautier.
These cases decide that members of
trades unions as well as other individuals
hnve a right to say that they will not
work with persons who do not belong to
their organization; and whether they say
this themselves or through their organ

have the right by pursuing that method

The outcome of the appeal is awaited

HOMER'S SAILING DELAYED
TWO CASES OF OILED CLOTHING
CAUSE TROUBLE.
Coal in the America Maru's Bunkers

pital Cases.
A board of survey has been ordered for
the hospital ship Relief. Several times
she has been announced as ready to sail
for Manila, but for various reasons she
never managed to get away on time. Yes
terday morning it was positively an
nounced that she would leave at 9:30
o'clock with about 100 hospital nurses and
a few doctors. At noon she was still
alongside the wharf and her captain said
at 1 p. m. he was going into the stream
to adjust the compasses. The Relief did
not go into the stream and at 3 p. m.
the board of survey was ordered by Gen
eral Sr-after.
The report to the authorities in Wash
ington set forth that the hospital ship had
a very small coal capacity and that to
roach Manila she would have to go via
Honolulu and Guam; also that owing to
her high docks she would be dangerous
In a typhoon. On this report the Govern
ment acted.
The transport Belgian King got away
with &00 men of the Thirty-fourth Regi
ment last night. Among the passengers
was Captain George E. Baldwin, former
ly a sergeant of police. He was appoint
ed a captain in the regulars and went to
Alaska with Major Ray's command. He
returned to San Francisco a few days
ago .md said on the wharf yesterday that
he had been appointed a captain in the
commissary department of the army In
Manila.
The transport Aztec did not get all her
load of horses aboard until late last night.
She will go to Manila via Honolulu. Tne
Centennial, which is also to transport
horses, will go to Honolulu and. leaving
her cargo there, will return to San Fran
cisco for another cargo of livestock. The
transports Grant, Sheridan and Sherman
will all go to Manila via Nagasaki.
Two small packages of oiled clothing
delayed the Balling of the steamer Ho
mer' for St. Michael twenty-four hours
and necessitated the discharge of nearly
all the cargo for Yukon River points and
Cape Nome. The Homer was to have
sailed Friday afte rnoon at 2 o'clock for
St. Michael. Anvil City, rape Nome and
Golovin Bay. An Imur before sailing time
the agent Was going over the bills of
lading and found one for '.wo cases of
i | oiled clothing. This kind of merchandibÂ«
j is never carried in the hold, as it is ii.i
--l ble t<> catch Hre from spontaneous com
â¢ bustujn when confined In a place where
: there is no ventilation. A search for the
, : dangerous cases was at once begun, but
no trace "f tht-m could be found. The or
der to unload tin- ship wan then Riven
;.:ni nearly every ton <>i cargo was taken
â¢ out before the rases were found in the
â  'tween deckÃ aft.
When the oiled clothing was found
â  i everybody except the agents of the ves
sel was happy. By working nearly all of
Friday night and all of yesterday the
i steamer was loaded again anrt stcaraeil
i away about 5 p. m. on her journey.
The delay is particularly exasperating
. i at this time of the year, as a day may
â  mean the loss e>f a connection at St.
! Michael. The Homer will not get there
until the first week in October, and at
that time last year the Yukon River was
â¢ frozen. Cape Nome, however, is well out
to Bea, and should the Homer be unable
j to reach St. Michael she will land all her
sunplies at Anvil City.
'ilie Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Bertha also sailed for st.
Michael yesterday. She is loaded down
with supplies and will stop at I'nalaska
on the way up. At. St. Michael she will
! connect with the company's smaller
steamers for Cape Nome and Golovin
j Bay.
â  : The little San Salvadorean steamer
: | Maulc was docked al Mission street wharf
. yesterday. She will take on coal and Bup

steamer of less than 100 tons burden and
was formerly employed on the Chilean
'. coast. She was supposed to have come
h<>re for an overhauling. Her captain
. says she will be In port for nearly a fort
! night, as there is no immediate need for
i the vessel In Salvadorean waters until the
new coffee crop is gathered.
The doctors at the Harbor Hospital were
kepi pretty busy yesterday. As soon as
one patient was discharged" there was an
; other ready for the operating table. H.
! Serrie, cook of the British ship Dynomene
had a badly lacerated face sewed up by
Dr. Robinson. He had some trouble with
; the bo' Bun, and the latter struck him.
! Serrie then reported the matter to the
j British Consul, and when the bosun heard
i of it he gave the rook an unmerciful beat
- intr and nearly put his eye out. Serrie
will make another report " to the Consul
I and will then remain away from the I iv

Charles Helling had the four fingers of
his left hand amputated by Drs. Robin

It will be the first week in October before
she arrives here, however, as the Mer

the coal in her bunkers having caught fire

of the coal had" to be thrown overboard,

COUNTY GOVERNMENT ACT.
Supreme Court Passes Upon the Right
to Sell Bonds.
Julius J. Mark, a resident and taxpayer
of Kern County, brought an action to
enjoin the Board of Supervisors from
carrying out a certain contract entered
into by the board and Trowbridge & Co.
relative to the sale of refunding bonds of
that county. The lower court decreed
a perpetual injunction, from which an
appeal was taken by Trowbridge. The
right and power of the Supervisors to
dispose of the bonds at all was the prin
cipal question before the court. By the
appellants it was contended that this
power is found in the county government
act of ISf'T, and by the respondents that
this power is denied to the Supervisors
and vested in the Treasurer under the
provisions of the county government act
of 1593. The Supreme Court, after re
viewing the two acts, said: "â¢ â¢ â¢ A
m<rr- reading of the two will at once dis
close that the legislature by the latter
formulated a plan for the issuance of

A man in Grand Rapids, Michigan, !
F. J. Hill, a druggist, discovered that j
cne of the most perfect and safe ways \
to wean a babe was to begin feeding j
Grape-Nuts, the famous breakfast food. I
His letter states: 'It there is a baby j
fo<Â»d that Is better than Grape-Nuts it |
isust be a dandy. We began feeding i
our little Carola Grape-Nuts before j
weaning, ai.l for a few months after >
it was her only food, and a fatter, more j
healtcy child could not be found. We j
were never up a night, nor did she ,
hsre a day's sickness. We didn't realize !
when she gave up the-narse. Conse- j
Quentiy we feel grateful for the pro- \
d^ct called Grape-Nuts and wish you j

ime manner that the human body

andied by even a very young baby.
It is not only the most powerful j

The attendance last night was the
largest of any night of the fair, and was

stand to testify in hia own behalf in the
perjury proceedings growing out of his
testimony given In the recent libel suit
brought against â¢- â  Examiner by ex-Sen
ator William J. Duns.
Sammy, of course, denied everything.
He fatly contradicted Senator Burkes
positive statement that It DO time did he
say that Senator Dunn's reputation for
truth, honesty and -_â¢-â -_- bad.
Braunhart was represented by Attorney
Garret McEnerney, and Â«m Frank Mc-
Gow&n's pleasure to cross-examine
Braunhart on txSalf of the people.
Attorney McEnerney at the outset of
fered in evidence sections of the journal
of the Senate referrti - to certain charges
made by Senator Bfggy, which were in
vestigated by a special Senate committee.
As me report of the committee practi
cally exonerated Senator Dunn. In that it
refused to decide in point of fact between
the statements made at that time by Sen
ators Bigs and Dunn, Attorney Jlc-
Gowar. offered no objection to the Intro
duction of the testimony. In fact, it had
little bearing on the merits of the case,
as it did not even bolstfr Braunhart'3
statement that Senator Burke told him
that Dunn's reputation was bad. Under
Attorney McGowan's sharp cross-exam
ination Sammy admitted that the
conversation which he says he had, wtth
Senator Burke, Senator Dunn's legislative
record only was discussed.
In his rambling testimony/ ranging from
legislative scandals to ward politics,
Braunhart that Senator Burke dis-
I cussed Dunn's position and the position
of other members of the Senate In con
nection with the HcCoppin act. .attorney
McGowan. who I* a clever student of leg

time he had the conversation with Sen
ator Burke the MeCoppln act was not

of the conversation had with Senator
Burke. At times he burst forth into pyro

court and spectators of the agony of lis
tening to his lens - â¢ - â¢ be*.
The conversation* which Senator Braun
hart had with J. J. McGovern in reference
to Senator Dunn's reputation were then
taken up. McGovem had already testified
that every time Senator Dunn was dis
cussed Senator Braunhart always intro
duced the subject. On the stand yester
day Braunhart swore that it was McGov
ern. and not he, who brought up the sub
ject. Aside from this contradictory testi
mony the fact remains that Mr. McGov
era swore positively that at no time did
he ' ever tell Senator Braunhact that Sen
ator Dunn's reputation Cor truth, honesty
and Integrity was bad. ."â 
Joe Piunkett, who admitted under cross
examination that Senator Braanhart once
secured him a position in the City Hall,
testified that he was present last Satur

The police are Investigating the alleged I
disappearance of property belonging to
! AViiliam B. Shrimpton. a mechanic, who
died suddenly of alcoholiem at 15 Verona!
I place last evening. Friends state that '
i Shrimpton was possessed of a valuable j
watch and Masonic charm shortly before j
his death, but the Coroner's (V-putles '
were unable to find either when they ar
rived at the house to take the body to the
Morgue. The statement of the landlady,
Mrs. M. Crowley, that two men repre
senting themselves as representatives of
a fraternal order had searched the me
chanic's room shortly after his death and
had departed with a valise, makes the
case somewhat suspicious and has Insti
gated the investigation. The disappear
ance- of the watch and charm was re- 1
j ported to H. J. Moulthrop of the Masonic
I board of relief by William R. Towne and
i William Haddock, both engineers and I
1 members of a lodge to which Shrimpton
; belonged, and the former communicated
; the Information to Deputy Coroner La- I

' quarters and had officers detailed to as

WILLIAM SELLS ON THE
EVOLUTION OF A CIRCUS
THE ADVANCEMENTS MADE IN
RECENT YEARS.
How the Walter Main Show Started
With a Spotted Pig and Be
came Famous.
"There has been a most complete evo
lution In the circuÃ business during tho
last few years, and the circus of to-day
is far from being the circus of our boy
hood tinys," remarked William Sells, who
has been coming to San Francisco In con
nection with circuses for several years
past.
"Speaking of the original circus ven
ture of Walter L. i.iain some fifteen years
ago, he was then living on a rocky farm
over In Ohio. He conceived the Idea of
having a circus. As a boy he had played
circus with the other boys at school. He
had visited all of the traveling shows that
stopped in Geneva, 0., and, gaining what
knowledge he could from observation,
Btarted a circus. He had a couple
of trained dogs, a cat and a sheep. Like
other boys, he showed in back yards and
the barns, and accepted pins and mar
bles as pay for the tickets to the reserved
seats. The juveniles of the town vlsltou
the performance and brought their par
ents along, all of whom pronounced it
the greatest show on earth.
"One night, while he was sleeping In
the loft of the old farm house, he con
cluded to take to the road. Geneva is not
much of a show town, but one fine sum
mer morning the citizens were surprised
to see advertisements posted upon the
dead walls, railing attention to the fact
that upon a certain date Walter L. Main's
circus would give Its Initial appearance.
The bills were- not four-sheet posters,
gaudy in bright colors, but instead they
were plain affairs, the printing being of
the scrawly kind such as you would ex
pect from boys.
"Well, the long and short of It was that
Walter I* Main had a circus. He had a
tent that a party of surveyors had used,
and in this he exhibited a learned pig, a
cow, a dog and some hens. The experi
ence in Geneva was the beginning of a
life career. It meant that he was to be
a showman. The next year he bousht a
spotted calf that had six legs, and in a
modest way and under a little tent ho
started out, visiting some of the nearby
towns. He made a little money, and the
next year he added a camel and hired a
man who could ride the horses and do
acrobatic turns In the ring. At the end
of the season he had made more money,
and the next year branched out, bought
a few more animals and hired a few more
performers.
"With him every promise was a pledge,
and he advertised nothing he did not
show. This was the beginning of his suc
cess. Since then things have been com
ing his way as well as could be asked for.
Each year he has added to his show, and
now has one of the best on the road.
From a show that had only a spotted pig
he has built up a concern that travels by
three trains. There are 800 people upon
the payroll, with a salary list that re
quires the expenditure of $3000 per day,
to say nothing of other expenses.
"As to Ban Francisco, I regard It as one
of the best show towns In the country,
and always feel certain of doing a good
business. This year we opened the sea
eon in Cleveland, 0., to enormous busi
nessâln fact, turned people away at all
performances.
"Like all other lines of trade, In order
to do business you must have the biggest
and the best. There was a time when the
one-ring show traveled over the country
and was good enough for anybody, but
now if a man would start out with such a
concern he would go broke Inside of forty
days unless he had an unlimited bank
account. To draw the crowd you must
come to town with a blare of trumpets.
You must first have your gilded advertis
ing cars, and then you must follow this
up with your smooth advance agents who
can drive good bargains. After this you
must have a lot or boomers who come a
couple of days In advance of the show.
Then as a climax you must have the
show. Of course, with the circus there
must be a lot of gold braid and tinsel, but
on the whole It muÃt be a show worthy of
FRED GRAY'S COUNTERFEITING PLANT ON NATOMA STREET.
located. The trunk which contained his
counterfeiting outfit will be turned over
to the United States authorities this
morning.
Gray first met Mills In Sacramento
shortly after the latter's discharge from
Folsom, where he had served four years
for burglary committed in Oakland. They
came to this city and- went to live In a
lodging-house on Grant avenue. Think
ing they were being watched, they moved
to the house on Natoma street, taking
their outfit with them.
Late Friday night they left their room
after turning out a quantity of bogus
half dollars, and walked down Natoma
street. When near Mission and Sixth
they met McCullom, who was evidently
lying in wait for them.
McCullom accosted Mills and in an an
gry tone accused him of having been too
friendly with his wife. Mills denied the
charge and started to walk away. Just
then McCullom, who was crazed from the
effects of opium, drew his revolver and
fired two shots at Mills. As the latter
fell to the sidewalk his murderous as
sailant again attempted to shoot, but was
patronage. Last year we had a troupe of
live acrobats, each of whom drew $100 per
day. It is doubtful if they t-arned the
money, but we had to have them, and as
an advertisement they were a great draw
ing card. We could have got something
cheaper, but we did not want to humbug
the people; and there you have It.
"It is a fact that the people of the coun
try like to be humbugged, and no better
evidence of this can be clt^d than the
I'ardifT giant which Mr. Karnum exhib
ited a number of years ago. The tli s=t
season that the stone figure was out It
was made apparent that the exhihit was
nothing but a carved block of gypsum
from the quarries of Fort Dodge, lowa,
but notwithstanding this thousands of
people visited the show Just to see the
freak. One year Mr. Main advertised a
beast which was supposed to be half man
and half horse. It drew a big crowd, and
Ihe paid It a big salary. In fact, it was
! a money-maker until one day when the
man-half got drunk and discarded the
horse-half, so he was left in the lurch,
with all of his advertising material out
on the boards.
"Since then Walter L. Main hna gone,
upen the theory that the best thing to do
Is to advertise and show only the legiti
mate. This year promises to be a bonanza
for the phowmon." continued Mr. Pells.
"The country KenM to be in a prosperous
condition, men are at work In all linos and
mon<\v â¢eemi to be In abundance. An era
of prosperity is sweeping the country,
and apparently there Is no reason why

prevented by Policeman O'Shea, who
after disarming him took him to the City
Prison. Mills, who Is said to be a des
perate burglar, was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where he now lies.
Gray, when questioned by the police,
attempted to deny that he had witnessed
the shooting. As he was identified by
several citizens as the man who was
with Mills at the time the police took him
to the City Prison and booked him
as a witness.
Evidently fearing that his room would
be located and his counterfeiting outfit
found. Gray yesterday sent for several
friends and endeavored to induce them
to have him released. He also tried to
Influence a former pal to visit his room
and do away with the evidence of his
guilt. Thinking that the police had taken
possession &t the trunk containing his
outfit, his friend refused. In the room
were also found a Colt's revolver and an

over to the United States authorities.

Through the Ân fl shone
thousands of lanterns, glimmering amid
the shrubbery like huge fireflies, and
here and ti Â,â¢ flre> de _
taching themselves from the greater
masses, wound their tortuous lengths
down the mountain sides to be lost amid
the universal brilliance that met them at I
tin-, water's edt;e-
- r^SsS>^ v r Jor .. â '
Every house was outlined in a hundred
different hues, every fence and post had
its quota of lanterns and each road and
footpath was traceable by the gleaming
splendor that marked its course.
From every butte and hillock, from
every point and headland, there flashed
upward a pyrotechnic volcano that, merg
ing Us hues with those of the chemical
fires that burned on every porch, ascended
and. spreading out, formed a glowing
canopy over all.
Down in the cove and along the water
front the scene was if anything more
beautiful, and thrice as animated. Be
ginning within a few hundred yards of
the hotel, which for the nonce had been
transformed into a translucent crystal
palace agleam with decorative fires, the
arks strung themselves out along the
Belevedere shore.
Each owner had tried to outdo his
neighbor in the beauty and artistic effect
of his decorations, and the result was an
ensemble which was as unique as it was
pleasing to the eye. No two house-boats
were the same, and none exhibited any
thing but a lavlshmer.t of adornment,
which was only limited by delicacy and
good taste.
Through this glittering maze small
launches, rowboats and other small craft
darted hither and thither, conveying vis
itors this way and that, or, filled with a
gay crowd of residents, they simply drift
ed idly about, serenading any one they
chanced to meet with a light song or a lot
of good-natured badinage.
From Belvedere Point to the end of the
Corinthian Club wharf the yachts had
anchored in a long chain fencing with a
stream of light the outer waters of the
bay from the little cove in which the
nuptial ceremonies were to be performed.
Each yacht had decorated itself In honor
of the occasion and the delicate tracery
BA^ FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER IT, 1899.
of spar and rigging was outlined against
the .lear background of the night by the
glistening lights with which they were
strung. Just outside this line lay the
different steamers and pleasure craft
which had come from the several points
around the bay to witness the celebration.
Still further out, as though to lend the
power of its protection to the happiness
within, lay the shapely .tfarblehead, a
huge luminous star, fitting 6ymbol of the
glory of our arms upon the sea, flashing
its promises of hope from between the
two tall smokestacks.
Seats had been erected on the hill over
the Corinthian Club, and these, together
with the private houses, the arks, hotel
and yachts, provided ample accommoda
tion for the crowds that arrived to par
ticipate in the celebration.
Beginning early in the morning tjiey
commenced to arrive in numbers just
great enough to comfortably fill the seat
ing capacity cf the regular boats, and
then the rush gradually increased until
they swarmed in in such crowds toward
the later hours that there was not a
square inch of standing room to spare
either on the regular boats or the extra
ones which were specially run for the oc
casion. Yet such was the excellence of
the management that all were attended
to, each one was made comfortable and
accommodated In every particular, and
among the 7000 visitors who, it is esti
mated, were received, not one serious
accident, complaint or altercation was re
ported.
Precisely at the hour setâ 9 o'clockâ the
wedding ceremonies commenced. At^^^H
nal from a cannon on the hill a long: pro
cession of gayly decorated barges started
from Belvedere Point, and moving in
stately procession passed into the cove
and up to the Olympic Club boathouse,
â¢where the Doge's barge was waiting for
j the escort which should conduct him to
â¢ his nautical nuptials.
As soon as the procession reached the
j Doge formal salutations were exchanged,
j and then the gorgeous flotilla, with the
I stately liucentaur in its center, passed
I out to the middle of the cove, where,
; amid the booming of cannon and the
i cheers of the thousands un the hillsides,
j the espousals were consummated and the
i ring dropped in the water, while rockets
I with their lurid splendor illuminated the
dark sky, carrying in their wild flight
heavenward thousands of brilliant stars,
which, bursting, showered down upon the
heads of those who, clustering around
| the Doge, awoke the echoes with the mel
ody of their voices.
As soon as tne actual ceremony had
been brought to a conclusion the line was
broken and in a minute the cove was
covered -with all soits and conditions of
boats, which hurried in and out among
the arks, exchanging greetings with
their owners, and then hurrying away on
borne errand of pleasure, only to return
in a short time ana again accept of the
! hospitality which was lavished on till
j sides.
The scene on land was much the same.
Every house was open, wide open, and
mirth was the watchword of the night.
The roads were filled with laughing men
and happy women. The whole scene was
one of carnival. Carnival partaking of all
the joyousness of the Latin nation and
yet so dignified and fre*e from the stain
of anything approaching license that
when one left one left nothing to regret.
From inception to conception Belve
dere's third "Night In Venice" was an un
qualified success. Nothing was left un
done and yet nothing was overdone. It
was as it was and that was exactly as it
should be.
The programme was carried out exactly
on time and not one single item was over
looked. When the piece had been enacted
and the sta^e was thrown open for all to
caper on they capered with right good
Will. But they capered decently, dec
orously, and the searchlights which from
the Marblehead and the top of Valentine
Hill played upon the revels until the
dawning of another day dimmed their
brightness discovered nothing which one
would have wished to omit from "A
Night in Venice."
YACHTS AND LAUNCHES
VIE WITH WARSHIPS
Never has a larger number of yachts
been gathered in one spot on the Bay of
San Francisco than were moored in Bel
vedere Cove. Every yacht club around
San Francisco contributed nearly its en
tire fleet, and, besides yachts, the United
States cruiser Marblehead. the torpedo
boat destroyer Farragut, arks, launches,
rowboats and tugs, lent variety to the
scene. The yachts were moved in a triple
line between Wheeler's Point and the Co
rinthian Yacht Club house, and presented
a pretty sight as they lay at the moor
ings in the bright light of day. But, as
darkness fell, strings of Chinese lanterns
and of fairy lamps lent a fantastic beauty
to the spectacle.
The arks were lined from end to end
with lighted lanterns, the most conspicu
ous among them being F. Bushnell's
Cuckoo and the large ark of George Wel
lington, the former having festoons of
varicolored fairy lamps above and all
around it, and the latter being illumin
ated entirely with red lanterns. The Illum
ination was complete by about 8:30 p. m.
The Illuminated launches and rowboats
[Pages 11 to 20

that were to take part in the performance
were assembled near Wheeler's Point and
proceeded slowly in double line up the
channel toward the Hotel Belvedere,
where they were joined by the Doge's
barge, which was crowded with an array
of senators and other officials in brilliant
robes of scarlet.
The searchlight on the top of Valentines
Island was kept fixed on the Doge's barge
during the ceremony, at the close of whLch
the Doge wedded the sea by casting a
ring Into the waters. The espousal of the
&ea being complete and the chorus, "Love
ly Night," having been sung, the boats
and launches passed in review before the
prize committee, consisting of Mayor J.
D. Phelan, Irving M. Scott, J. A. Stanton
and Vanderlynn Stow. The prize for the
most beautifully illuminated ark was
awarded to F. Bushnell's Cuckoo; for the
most beautifully illuminated yacht to E.
F. Sagar's sloop Edna, for rowboats to
Mr. Dohrman and for the best house to
J. M. Mattoon.
The sloop Edna had an electric plant on
board, which served to illuminate trans
parencies representing the stars and
Btripea and the Union Jack, and to throw
into brilliant relief the letters of her
name. J. M. Mattcon's house was nota
ble for the dome which had been erected
above it in imitation of the dome of the
new City Hall.
A few rowboats carrying no lanterns
managed to get within the inclosed space,
but on the whole the patrol was i#Dst ef
fectively kept, and the whole perform
ance passed off without a hitch or a mis
hap. The United States cruiser Marble
head kept her searchlight in constant op
eration and displayed a beautiful electric
star. The Farragut anchored consid
erably farther out than the cruiser, but
was even more prettily decorated, her
sides, funnels and masts being outlined

with electric lights.
Noticeable among the craft flitting
about the cove was the launch Imp. which
had a lire of electric lamps from stem
to stern and a windmill revolving In her
bow.

Besides the illumination of houses on
the shore, of arks, yachts, launches ami
rowboats on the water, searchlights
from the t'nited States cruiser Marble
head and the hill above the Corinthian
Club house, many rockets were sent up
from a barge moored in the cove, and co'

THE ENGINEERS
HAVE STARTED
FOR THE COAST
Miners Soon to Greet
Their Guests.
Â« â
This week will feel the stir of many
miners In full action. The special train j
hearing the bis? party of Eastern mem
bers of the American Institute of Mining j
Engineers will cross the northern State (
line on Saturday, en route to the annual
meeting of this big organization of 3000 j
Fclentlflc men, in San Francisco on the
Esth inst. and succeeding days.
They will receive their first royal Cali
fornia welcome at Montague on next Sat
urday, when they will run against a spe
cial carload of eminent members of the
California Miners' Association, some em- i
inent California mineral waters and a few
other eminent things, including old Shas
ta. Royal California hospitality will at
tend the guests for the next two weeks.
The general programme and the Itiner
ary, as heretofore pi/blished in The Call,
will bo adhered to, with the exception of j
very light changes. Sunday will be given ;
to Redding, the Keswick smelters and the
liig Mountain copper mine, and Monday.
Tuesday and Wednesday will be given to
the sessions of the annual meeting at the
Palace Hotel, to the degree that social
and other temptations, including those
provided by the California Miners' Asso
ciation, will permit. Then will come the
long and interesting trips about the min
ing regions of the State, from north to
south and along the mother lode, occupy
ing about two weeks and larded with
much hospitality provided by boards of
Suimrvisois, local committees of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, commercial
and other bodies, et al.
Among the latest reports received by
Secretary E. H. Benjamin announcing lo
cal hospitalities is one from the Fresno
Chamber of Commerce, which proposes to
do "the proper thing" when these emi
nent mining men are ready to drift
through the big vineyards of Fresno
County and possibly determine the duty
of a minor's inch of San Joaquin Valley
wine. One feature of the day at Orovllle
is to be a big open-air feast provided by
ladies of that place during an intermls
fcion in an inspection of gold dredges, etc..
made easy by the Butte County Miners
Association, with the usual aid of local
newspapers and enterprising citizens.
During the past week local preparations
in ban Francisco, which are mainly in
the executive hands of Secretary Benja
iiiin of the California Miners' Association,
have consisted largely of correspondence
â with commltteemen and others through
out the State. Among the many local
arrangements already .made is one for
a reception to the ladies, tendered by the
California Club, for ono,day of the San
Francisco meeting.
To-morrow activities will become gen
eral In caring for the details of the gen
â¢ ral programme already arranged. W. C.
Ralston, vice pr< siuer.t of the California
Minors' Association and chairman of the
general committee on arrangements, will
return from the Molones mine in Cala
veras County and help swing the helm.
President J. 11. Nelt will be on hand early
this week to lend a hand and some wise
counsel. The San Francisco County Min
ers' Association will bold a special meet
ing to consider a situation which calls on
the industrial patriotism " : the San Fran
cisco mining men of public spirit. The
annual meeting was secured for San
Francisco by the California 'Miners' As
sociation, which has gladly assumed the
duties of a host in behalf of the whole
State which is asked to join In the recep
tion '.hi,! the members of the- local or
ganization, which Includes some of the
most prominent and enterprising members
of thf business community, are showing a
quick readiness to aid in making this
meeting of this great body a red letter
one in its history.
The financial and commissary depart
ments will bo got into special activity
Â«.ar"ly this week. The finance committee,
of which A. A. Watkins is chairman, will
go to work getting the rest of the sev
eral thousand dollars wanted by the as
pociation to enable it to do the handsome
thing The other day two members of the
committee went around one afternoon and
raised $1700. This has been increased
since then, and it is not expected that
there will be any trouble about getting
the rest in a city which was founded on
the mining industry, which has been built
up largely through it. which has so many
millions of its capital invested in mines,
which has several thousand citizens finan
cially interested In mines and which is
the financial, commercial and manufac
turing mining center of the entire Pacific
r< ThÂ°e n commissary department is not like
ly to need any boards of investigation

The party that arrives includes quite
a number of eminent men whose wide (
reputations are not confined to the fields i
of mining, geology and metallurgy, in
wh'ch they have chiefly acuuii > d what j
fame is theirs. Dr. Jamrs Douglass of j
New York is the president of the insti- |
tute and of the company owning the great j
r Queen mine of Arizona. David i
T. Day of the United States Geological j
Survey has needed no identification among I
mining men for many years. Many other
names command respect in these fields
and out of them.
A few very eminent men 'will probably
be greatly missed, because they will get
good money for mixing in a big legal
battle now on in the courts at Butte City,
Mont., in which the company owning the
great Anaconda mine iÂ« a party and in
which valuable ore bodies far under
ground are at stake.
Rossiter W. Raymond, founder and
present secretary of the institute, and the
oldest and best known authority on the
mining resources of the country, is an
expert on one side. So are Waldemar
Linggren and Clarence King, who have
done such splendid service to the mining
Industry through the United States Geo
logical Survey and otherwise. So are W.
S. Keyes and Louis Janin of San Fran
cisco. The hearing of this suit begins
to-morrow at Butte City, and these men
are supposed to be there. If the trial pro
ceeds they will likely stay there; if not,
they will be present.
The party that will meet the visitors at
Montague will, according to the present
plans, include President J. H. Neff, Vice
President W. C. Ralston, Secretary E. H.
Benjamin, Professor S. B. Christy, W. A.

URGED TO JOIN IN THE
FIGHT FOR NEW HOSPITAL
THE PRESENT BUILDINGS REEK
WITH DISEASE, i
The movement Inaugurated by Dr. W.
B. Coffey of the Board of Health to se
cure the erection of a new City and Coun
ty Hospital to replace the filthy, germ
infested buildings that now bear that ti
tle, has reached a stage where the united
efforts of all v.-ho have the slightest re
i gard for the health of the community are
i requested to induce the Board of Super
| visors to take such action as will make
| the building of a new hospital possible by
providing money for that purpose in the
I next tax levy.
In pursuance of this idea, and in view of
the fact that Monday Is the last day for
action by the Supervisors, Dr. Coffey yes
! terday held a conference with Health Of
j ficer Lawlor, as a result of which It was
I decided to send an appeal to all interested
I bodies and individuals throughout the
; city, urging them to use all their Influence
I with the Supervisors to secure the needed
| appropriation. The following letter was
j prepared and sent to every minister in
i the city by special messenger, to the Red
I Cross, to the Merchants' Association, the
â  Chamber of Commerce, the newspapers,
! physicians, lawyers, and in fact to every
! body who it was thought could be Induced
i to take an active interest in the move
ment:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15, 1899.
The Ban Francisco Call, Cityâ Dear Sirs:
There is an urgent effort being; made to in. luce
. the honorable Board of. Supervisors to appro
! priate or provide the ways and means to have
| constructed a new City and County Hospital,
j to the end that the city may provide an Insti
! tution for the care of the deserving poor, that
! may be a credit to the municipality. Your
| kind co-oneration In the matter is earnestly
i solicited, ond the honorable Board of Health
trusts you can see your way clear to give the
j matter your support before tho Board of Su
! pervisors at its next meeting:, Monday, the
ISth inst., at 2 p. m. The Importance of the
above action at this time is that at the meet
ing on the 18th the subject of appropriating
; money for the proper conduct of the city gov
ernment for the next fiscal year will be con
! sidered.
For the rust twenty-five years the City and
i County Hospital has served as a refuge for
! every known form of disease. The Institution
is saturated with filth and impregnated with
i germs. The wards are a menace to the health
:of the Inmates. Over one-third of the mor
! tality at this Institution show that patients
who have been treated for bronchial and other
complaints have re-entered the hospital, hay
: ing become In the meantime victims of tuber
culosis or consumption contracted during their
! previous residence In the wards. The recent
â  severe Illness of eljht attending nurses with
typhoid fever and the death of one of the
medical staff due to the came disease is a suf
; ficient warning cry to this community to eradi
cate this disgrace and ulcer from our midst.
i By order of the Board of Health. Yours very
WILLIAM M LAWLOR,
Health Officer.
E. B. CARROLL, Secretary.
Dr. Coffey Is in hope that the minister?
will recognize the urgency and importance
i of the matter and discuss the subject from
! their pulpits to-day, or at least lend their
i personal Influence with the Supervisors to
i secure new hospital buildings. As was
stated in the communication forwarded to
the Supervisors by the Board of Health
a day or two ago, the present City and
County Hospital buildings are unlit for
occupation, and if they are not replaced
] will be condemned and the hospital closed.

INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT.
James Coffroth. clerk of the Superior
Court in San Francisco, started from
Bushnell's ark In a rowboat to go to the
Tlburon pier to bring off Judge Hunt.
He had covered about half the distance,
when the steam launch Gypsy ran Into
his frail craft, cutting it completely in
half. Coffroth was thrown into the water,
but, being an expert swimmer, managed
to keep afloat until he was rescued by the
launch.
F. H. Bushnell's ark Cuckoo was one
of the most brilliant features of the fete.
It was brilliantly lighted from stem to
stern, and in addition to dispensing open
handed liberality all the evening Bush
nell kept a perfect shower of colored
rockets and bombs bursting and falling
from the sky in the vicinity of his craft.
DECORATED HOUSES.

my complexion to prevent looking upon
my return to town as though my face
had been dipped in rcdhot grease. Well.
1 didn't have a bit of a good time, and
I when my friends saw me they all de
clared they didn't believe I'd been away
at all; thought I'd just been concealing
myself in an attic or a back bedroom!
So no cold cream this year, and my trunk
boasts nothing in the way of a head pro
tection but a few of the daintiest little
hats that would be about as much service
in protecting my face from the sun as a
doughnut pinned to my trusses. The
doubting Thomases shan't have the
shadow of a chance this year."
And she wafted me a kiss from the tips
of her ringers and was gone without hav
ing given me an opportunity to slip In a
word edgeways.
Well! 1 met her again yesterday, and
! of all the forlorn looking creatures that
! one could possibly imagine she certainly
took the lead. Her nose looked as though
it was endeavoring to amputate itaelf by
a slow peeling process, and her erstwhile
fair complexion was covered with a gold
en brown tan that had distributed itself
like patches on a crazy quilt.
â¢Well what kind of a lime did you
\ ye?" I inquired, delicately ignoring the
state of her complexion, but well-nigh
bursting with a desire to say "I told
you so.
â¢â¢Oh, 1 had a glorious time. Went fish
ing without any hat? at all and sat out
on a huge, beautiful bowlder by the sea,
with the only young man in the place.
â  Never gave my complexion a thoughtâ
! lust went in for a good time and had it,
but do you think I'm hilariously huppy,
now that it's all over? Look at my face!
Did you ever see anything quite so
hideous?" .Â«..Â».Â»
"P.ut Low about your friends? I inter
rupted. "Have you succeeded in convinc
ing them that >ou spent your summer
away from town?"
"My friends!" she exclaimed, the
brutes do nothing but giggle and smirk
and nudge each other, and make disa
greeable allusions to cold cream and other
remedies. Dear Mme. Hygeia, I shall
take your advice next time, but what in
in.- world shall 1 do in the meanwhile to
K<-t rid of this horrid tan?"
There are probably others in the same
l,Â«,it with this little girl, so they shall
have the benefit of my suggestions.
Tan is much easier to acquire than to
get rid of. Besides, it's a case of "him
that has. gits." However, as it is caused
merely by exposure to wind or sun, it is
the easiest thing in the world to avoid.
GIOVeB, a few pretty veils and a good
Sized parasol will successful combat the
warmest of old Sol's rays and the bliz
sardlest blizzard that ever hailed from
Medicine Hat. Any good cold cream will
help matters along. Never, under any cir
cumstances, bathe your face In soap and
water before going out or just after com
ing in.
A lotion that is said to prevent the skin
from tanning to any great extent is the
following:
Distilled witch hazel, three ounces.
Prepared cucumber juice, three ounces.
Rosewater, one and one-half ounces).
Essence of white rose, one and one-half
ounces.
Simple tincture of benzoin, one-half
ounce.
Rub this into the skin with the finger
tips and after the cuticle has absorbed
it apply a pure vegetable powder.
After the face has become tanned or
Bun burned there really is nothing to do
but to apply plenty of cold cream and to
protect the skin from further exposure
to the elements.
Answers to Correspor)der)ts.
O. N. E.â The only way to keep the
pores of the skin emptied of the seba
ceous matter that clogs them 1b to give
the face an energetic scrubbing every
night with a complexion brush of good,
firm bristles, warm water and castile
soap. Follow the scrubbing with a liberal
smearing with a good cold cream. I am
sure, this will help you.
SIAUDIEâ The following tonic will cer
tainly make the eyebrows grow: Red
vaseline, 3 ounces; tincture of canthar- >
ides. l / 2 ounce; Jamaica rum, % ounce;
origanum, 6 drops; glycerin, Vi ounce; oil
of rosemary 5 drops.
â¢ MARY CARPENTERâ I am very sorry
that 1 could not give you an answer just
when you requested it, but it would not
have been fair to the others who were
ahead of you. You say you are obliged
to do much brain work. This doubtless is
the cause of the "loss of your hair. The
hair splits at the ends because of lack
of nourishment at the roots, and as long
as the split ends remain the hair will re
fuse to grow. The first thing to do, then, â 
is to singe off all the split ends, every one
of them, and then supply the nourishment
that is lacking. Sometimes a little warm
olive oil rubbed into the roots with the
fingertips is all that is necessary. How
ever, 1 wish you would try the following
tonic. It is a wonder, and even though
it has alcohol in it, I feel certain that it
will stop the hair coming out almost in
stantly: Forty-eight grains resorcin, one
fourth ounce glycerin, and alcohol enough
to fill a two-ounce bottle. Apply to the
scalp every night with a small sponge,
rubbing it in well. Very dry hair should
not be shampooed oftener than once a
month. " If you really hesitate to use a
tonic containing alcohol, then try the fol
lowing: Two drams tincture of canthar
ides, six ounces essence of rosemary and
eleven ounces elderfiower water. I should
not cut the hair off if I were you; at least
not yet awhile.
SISSYâ Yes, the warm olive oil will cer
tainly bring about the development you
desire if you use it every night of your
life, rubbing it into the skin for ten cr
fifteen minutes at a time. It will be at
least seven or eight weeks before any de
velopment will be noticeable, but it will
surely come if the rubbing is persisted in.
Dashing with cold water in the morning
and rubbing with a Turkish towel will
help the work along.
TESLA-You will find the following lo
tion delightful -or the hands: Gum trag
acanth, whole, 30 grains; rosewater, 7
ounces; glycerin. J 2 ounce; alcohol, *Â£
ounce. Soften the tragacanth in rose
water for a day or two. and strain for
cibly through muslin or cheesecloth. Then
add glycerin and alcohol. Previously
mixed, shake well and periume to suit.
VALERIE FLOYDâ The lotion sug
gested in foregoing letter to Tesla Is just
what you need to whiten and soften the
hands. The best complexion brush is one
of firm, wnite bristles. Use it just as you
would any brush.

GREYHOUNDS
RUN WELL AT
UNION PARK
Evenly Matched Dogs Pro
vide Exciting Sport for
the Leashmen.
"With strong hares and evenly matched
dogs the coursing at Union Park yester
day was of the sensational order. In
many instances the greyhounds ran
J)across the field like double teams. The
average of the courses was unusually
long, especially in the Produce stake con
solation. Rosio Clair was one of the un
fortunates, requiring two minutes and
twenty seconds to defeat Hugh Lynch 1
Lexington. Rock Island King required the
same time to secure the Hag from hot
Haste, the score being 17 to 14. O'Hara
put May Hempstead outâ to 0.
There were an unusually large number
of "byes," owing to dogs being with
drawn. Many of them had not recovered
from their hard work last week.
In the open stake Crawford Lad beat
Bhylock Boy after running two minutes
and twenty seconds. Johnny R beat
Maori Land after a grand working course.
Lord Byron, at odds of 1 to 3, beat Mlai
mo. Minneola ran a desperate course with
Warship, defeating him by a score of 19
to 1. The winner was 1 to 3 in the bet
ting. Lowlander and Pet Kirby had
'"byes" and ran them oft! together. Each
scored three points and Judge Grace did
net require them to run again as they
had done sufficient work. Rochester and
Moonlight ran an â¢"undecided." The
former broke one of his toes and was
drawn. Connemara beat Mose handily
and is favorite for the stake. Bohe is
favorite for the Produce stake consola
tion, with O'Hara, Rosle Clair and Wan

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
The crowd that Journeyed out to Ingle
slde Coursing Park yesterday to watch
the hounds chase the fleet hares over the I

were enough shortenders winning to make
the game Interesting. The hares ran i
well, some of the courses being unusu- I

biggest upset of the day was the defeat
of Soubrette by Joy Bells at five to one.

SHAMROCK'S
UNDERBODY
Mystery of the Yacht's Con
struction Is Shortly to Be
Revealed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 16.â Yachtsmen will
be glad to learn that there will be an
opportunity several days before the inter
national match between the Columbia and
Shamrock to see these racers out of
water.
Th-.-re has been a great deal of mystery
about the foreign cutter, her designer.
Will Fife Jr.. deeming it best to con
struct her in secret and launch her "in
petticoats." Then since her arrival in
, these waters only her crew and a few
1 home friends of Sir Thomas Lipton and
I designers have been permitted on board.
Thus little that is positive has been as
! certained about the yacht beiow water
i and only guesswork leads tv the sug
! gestion that the shape of her underbody
] may forcibly remind yachtsmen of the
! Defender.
All who took the trouble to make the
journey to Bristol, R. L, could see the
Columbia out of water, and excellent
photographs of her have been made and
published both here and abroad. The
days of mystery. however, are rapidly
passing, as on Thursday, September 2s,
about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, both
yachts will be taken in the larger docks
at the Jonn X. Robins Company's Ehlp
yard, Erie Basin. There with bow and
stern -within a few yards of each other
they may be looked at and studied until
the following Monday, October 2, the day
before the I'.rst international race.
It is pretty certain that the pieced-out
gaff used on the Shamrock during her
practice spin Thursday lest did nnt give
satisfaction. There was no time lost this
morning in bringing it back to the city,
and if reports are true It will be stiffened
with angle irons in time to be used in
Monday's trial. This old graff Is only a
makeshift, and its place will be taken by
the racing spar which buckled last week
as soon as it has been repaired.

BROOKLYN, Sept. Another row marked

ragged fielding and some sensational fielding.
Brooklyn was ahead when the seventh inning
closed. Believing that another Inning could
not be completed. Swartwood called the game.

THE Â£AST FRAtfCIStO CALL, SUSPAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1899.
WASPS WIN
FROM DUDES
BY ONE RUN
Little Stick Work and Hard
Luck Make an Inter-
esting Game.
San Franciseos 1, Oaklands 0.
For six Innings Cal E wing's packers of
dress-suit cases and Uncle Harris' sting
ers failed to score. Then the locals bit
off a chunk of luck and forced the scorer
to pull the cord that rang the bell that
woke the boy who works on the score
board. The Dudes were in bad luck and
they gave the boy no necessary or un
necessary labor.
Up to the seventh Inning the play was
of a peculiar order, few hits, plenty of
men on bases and no runs. This is how
the game was won and why Ewing smiles
no more. Riley fanned thrice and said
something not in polite vocabularies. Then
Mr. Pyne took a stick and made the first
station by an honest safe hit. Fitzpatrick
played Casey at the bat and went to the
benches after three air-slashing fans. All
this time Pyne played a love game with
the first bag, fearing to stray away. Mr.
Brockhoff was next to bat and Pyne took
heart and attempted to steal second.
Hammond threw to Francks, who was
anxiously awaiting the ball, but it was
a bad effort on the part of Hammond and
the spheroid went a-bounding to fax cen
ter. Pyne is fleet of foot and he fairly
flew over the course, beating the ball
home by the closest possible margin.
There was wild and unrestrained excite
ment in the avuncular camp and the
Dudes were a few shades bluer than
ultramarine.
Several times after this burst it looked
as if there was a chance for the Dudes,

FRENNA HELD
IN JAIL ON A
BENCH WARRANT
Writ of Certiorari Was
Dismissed.
Superior Judgre Lawlor haÂ» filed an
opinion in which he holds that it Is be
yond his Jurisdiction to review the action
of Police Judge Graham ordering the re
lease of Joseph P. Frenna, murderer of
J. F. Turner, from custody. A writ of
certiorarl demanding a review of the pro
ceedings of the lower court, secured at
the instance of the prosecution, has in
consequence been dismissed by the court,
but the fact remains that Frenna is still
in jail. Immediately upon the dismissal
of the writ George D. Collins, who. dur
ing the certiorari proceedings, occupied
the position of special prosecutor, went
Immediately to Presiding Judge Dalnger
field and laid the facts of the case be
fore him Judge Dalngerfleld forthwith
issued a bench warrant for the arrest of
the murderer, if his release was secured
on bonds, remanding him to the custody
of the Sheriff without bail. An informa
tion charging Frenna with murder was
then filed with the court and the case
was assigned to Judge Cook for trial. To
morrow morning Judge Cook will review
the case and if he linds that "the proof
is evident or the presumption great" that
I'renna is guilty of the crime charged he
will refuse him his liberty on ball; if
otherwise the prisoner will be released on
bonds, but for a greater sum than that
fixed by the committing magistrate.
Alter reviewing the facts of the arrest,
preliminary examination and admittance
to baH of the prisoner and calling atten
tion to the fact that the law makes
Judges from those of the lowest court to
the supreme tribunal equally Qualified
magistrates, Judge Lawlor says:
Tl.e single question before the court
is, Did the respondent, Hon. Thomas
F. Graham, have authority to admit
the delendant to bail? In other words,
does the writ of certiorari lie to re
view his action in that behalf?
The writ of certiorari is a writ of re
view and can only issue for the pur
pose of reviewing final determinations
and adjudications of inferior tribunals,
boards or officers exercising judicial
functions when there is no appeal nor
any plain, speedy or adequate remedy.
The general scope of the writ is well
defined in the case of Whitney vs. The
B. of D. of S. F. F. D., 14 Cal.. 500.
The decision sayu: "We think it ia
well settled that a common law cer
tiorari tries nothing but the Jurisdic
tion and Incidentally the regularity

dicap at Gravesend Race

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 16.-In the Prospect

CHICAGO, Sept 16.-The public and Ed
of the proceedings upon which the jur
isdiction depends. It brings up no is-
Bue of law or fact not Involved in the
question of Jurisdiction. Under no cir
cumstances can the review be extend
ed to the merits. Upon every question
except the mere question of power the
action of the inferior tribunal is final
and conclusive. This we understand
to be the settled doctrine both in Eng
land and In this country-"
The position of the petitioner In this
matter is substantially that the said
respondent acted as a magistrate in
the case; that he had pursued and
acted within his authority as such
magistrate up to the point of holding
the defendant to answer; that his au
thority in respect to bail is dependent
upon the ascertainment of a fact,
namely, does the testimony show that
the proof is evident or the presump
tion great? and that Inasmuch as the
Jurisdiction to admit to bail depends
upon the ascertainment of a fact, such
fact Is the legitimate subject of review
under a writ of certiorari on behalf of
the people.
The position of the respondents,
however, is that the said respondent,
Hon. Thomas F. Graham, acted regu
larly within the general Jurisdiction of
a magistrate, which jurisdiction ex
tends to the determination of the
question of ball in capital cases^gSLnd
that having acted regularly therein
the writ of certiorari does not lie on
behalf of the people.
It is true, as counsel haÃ pointed
out, if certiorari does not lie in a case
like the one at bar the rights of the
people might be seriously invaded If
the magistrate failed to prudently or
even conscientiously perform his duty
therein, but such liability attaches to
the enforcement of the law generally.
The law itself approximates right and
Justice. Every power has its corre
sponding responsibilities. The people
in a country like this select those who
shall enforce the laws, and if there
be a failure in the administration
thereof the fault Is not in the law it
self but in the administration of it.
The best and most beneficent of laws
may be the subject of official abuse.
The enforcement thereof in the con
creto cnn be no nearer perfection than
is human nature itself.
Upon a full consideration of the is
sues in this matter, however, the court
la of the opinion that the authority of
the magistrate in fixing ball in a cap
ital case is found In the general Juris
diction conferred upon him and not
made tn depend upon the sufficiency
of the evidence Introduced before him
in each particular case; that In this
case the respondent. Hon. Thomas F.
Oraham. hnd authority to determine
the qti^stion of hail under such general
jurisdiction; that his action in the ex
ercise of such jurisdiction appears reg
ular on its face, and that the merits of
his determination therein are not the
subject of review by this court.
After the decision had been read Georg<
D. Collins carried the matter to Presiding
Judge Daingerfleld. with the result stated
while John A. Hnsmer, who represents the
defendant, appeared before Judge Gra
ham with a bond for Frenna's release
Before acting- In the matter, however
Judge Graham presented the bond to Ex
pert Newman for investigation,. Ever
though it is passed upon the bench war
rant still stands between Frenna and lib
erty, and the story of his crime will per.
hapn be told again before a final declsior
In the matter of ball is reached.
Corrlgan captured everything In sight at
the Hawthorne track to-day. Favorites
and close second choices, all well played,

INJURED AT A
STEEPLECHASE
Accident to Sidney Still-
well.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAXTA BARBARA, Sept. 15.â Sidney
I Stillwell, one of the best-known gentle
| man riders of England and well known
I in club circles of this city and at the
Burlingame Club, received Berioue in
juries this afternoon and to-night he is
in a very critical condition.
The members of the four hundred of this
city gave a race meet this afternoon at
Agricultural Park and during the three
and a quarter mile hurdle race Stillwell's
horse fell with him while making a hur
dle. Stillwell fell under his horse, being
held there by the weight of the animal
for two or three minutes. Stillwell was
leading at the three-eighths mile hurdle
when his horse fell. He was caught un
der the hind-quarters of the horse and
as the horse attempted to rise he began
kicking. Stillwell knew that he would
be kicked to death if the horse succeeded
In getting up, so he reached for the line
of the bridle and turned the horse's head
so he could not rise, but ail this time Still
well was suffering terrible pain from the
weight of the horse.
Two minutes later, when assistance ar
rived from the finish, half a mile distant
Stillwell was still unable to move and was
covered with blood. He was taken to the
grandstand and then immediately to the
Santa Barbara Clubhouse. An hour after
the accident he became unconscious and
it was found that his shoulder had been
broken and his fnad badly cut and
bruised. He is suffering from a concus
sion of the brain and late thiÃ evening
had not gained consciousness.
Stillwell came here about two years ago
from England as the private secretary
and general manager of the CounteaÂ«
Riter, who maintains a beautiful home in
El Monteclto. although 6he lives here but
a short time during the winter. Slillw-il
is one of the best-known steeplechasers
of England, and his skillful manipulation
of tandems at the horse shows in this ciiy
has excited much comment.

Henry T. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works, appeared before United
States Commissioner Heacock and pre
sented a written order signed by the quar
termaster directing the work on all the
Government transports to be done with

such work was under the head of "ex

LAST DAY
OF RACES AT
SACRAMENTO
Charley Davis Attacked for
Bidding Up Yule, Winner
of the Last Race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 16.â An immense
crowd attended the closing day of the
State Fair racing meet at Agricultural
Park and the betting was of the fierce
order, notwithstanding the short prices
laid by the bookies. Nearly every horse
starting was accorded more or less sup
port, and with four of seven choices win
ning the books cleaned up in the neigh
borhood of $4000.
After Lottie had defeated Psyche for
the 2:26 class trot the free-for-all pace was
called. Don was lnstaJled a stanch fa
vorite and took the first heat with ease
from Al Gregor. In the second heat Don
left his feet at the first turn and Beech
wood won easily from Fannie Putnam in
2:l4V*. The third heat found Don going
as steady as clockwork and he won prick
ing his ears in 2:14^4.
Bracdta this trip led Fannie Putnam
past the wire for the place. At the far
turn Beechwood made a disastrous break,
which lost him second money, for the
distance Hag was waved in his face. Much
better refused to score up, ar.-l after the
race was reported to have ruptured an
intestine.
The Favorite stake, over one mile and
a quarter, was the stellar feature among
the running events, resulting in a handy
victory' for Reolia, piloted by Mounce.
At post time Fortis and Monrovia were
equal choices in the betting. Monrovia,
with Butler in the saddle, made the run
ning for a mile, where she had enough.
Well bunched a furlong from home,
Reolia parted company with the field,
leading out Fortis half a length, with
Rapido at the latter's saddle skirts. It
was a pretty finish, speaking volumes for
the skill of the handicapper.
The only unusual happening: of the af
ternoon occurred just after the last race,
when Yule, the winner, was bid up from
$200 to $475 by Charley Davis. During the
progress of the bidding Windy Jim, a fol
lower of the turf, struck Davis, nearly
precipitating a riot. Dick Ledgett took
sides with Davis, landing a right-hander
on Windy, knocking him down. Ledgett
was in turn given battle by another turf
man, and for a while it looked as if the
struggle would be a gory one. It sub
sided quickly and the mare was bid in by
"Daggie" Smith for her owner, Hiram
Elliott.
In the 2:26 trot Donathan found much

per Fruitvaie school, and requested that a
department of manual training be estab

it general all over the county, and if the
funds will permit this may be done In this

FORGETS THAT
HER HUSBAND
TRIED MURDER
Judge Smith Orders a
Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 16.
Although Edward Rockhill and his wife
have forgiven each other and are now
living together as peacefully as doves the
husband was held to answer to-day to the
Superior Court for attempting to murder
his wife a month ago. When the Rock
hllls quarreled Mrs. Rockhlll swore to a
complaint charging her husband with try-
Ing to murder her with a butcher knife,
which he, according to the lady's story,
used very freely in slashing her breast.
The husband claimed that when he at
tempted to punish his wife he was suf
fering from a charge of buckshot in his
left shoulder, which he claims Mrs. Rock
hill had shot into him with the family
shotgun.
When the case was first called before
Judge Smith the pair were willing to tes
tify to all kinds of heinous thir.gs against
each other. Since then they have patched
up a peace and in the interval have con
cluded to forget and forgive. In the Po
lice Court to-day Mrs. RockhtU was put
on the stand for cross-examination, she
having told her direct story of the at
tempted tragedy two weeks ago. To the
surprise of the prosecution she said she
was not responsible for her previous tes
as she had not taken food for
eral days and her head troubled her
at the time.
The witness stated that eight years ago
she suffered an injury to her head and
since that time her memory Is very bad.
She said that they were both angry at
the time of the attempted murder and
she believes she was aj much to blame aa
her husband.
In answer to a question by the court
the lady said she could not tell, because
of her excitement at the time, whether
her husband cut her on the breast or not.
But she did remember that while she had
hold of a shotgun In the barn it went eft
accidentally, but she never shot her hus
band Intentionally.
Judge Smith decided that the evidence
justified holding the prisoner under $2000
bail and the wife left the court to secure
the necessary bondsmen.

DELAY IN PROBATING
VANDERBILT'S WILL
Family Awaits the Arrival of Alfred
Vanderbilt, Who Is Traveling
Abroad.
NEW YORK. Sept. 16.â The will of Cor
nelius Vanderbilt will not be probated
nor its contents made public until young
Alfred Vanderbilt, the second son, can
reach home. He is now in the mountains
of Japan. It will be four or five weeks
before he can arrive in New York at the
quickest. . ;
This decision was reached to-day by the
members of the family and their lawyers
at a conference in Senator Depew'3 of
fice. These gentlemen agreed that Alfred
Vanderbilt was one of the chief heirs to
his father's estate and it would be far
wiser and more considerate of his inter
eats to defer probating the will until he
could be In New York.
A cable message was lent to him. tell
ing him to return to v v York with all
possible speed. This canceled a previ
ous cable message advising that he com
plete his tour around the world, as his
presence six weeks after the funeral
would do no good. What else was de
cided upon at the conference was not
divulged. Each of those present left the
Grand Central station separately. All re
fused to say a word save Mr. Depew,
who 'simply announced that all action
would be deferred till Alfred Vander
return.
The entire will and codicils are in Mr.
Vanderbiit's own handwriting. He wrote
the original document several years ago.
submitting the rough draft to his law
yers. Several codicils were added from
time to time. All in turn were revised by
the lawyer that each might be in proper
legal form. Then they were returned to
Mr. Vanderbilt, who Is said to have copied
the entire will and codicil again in
his own handwriting. It is not a long
will.
Mr. Vanderbilt had very clear ideas
about the division of his vast estate and
framed these ideas in very terse English,
which left no doubt a3 to his intentions.
He often told his lawyers that he did not
wish his will crowded with a mass of
legal verbiage.
Cornelius vanderbilt Jr. has not been
disinherited because of his marriage to
Miss Grace Wilson against his father's
wishes.

him and which has since been transferred

will, she desiring to leave his share of
the estate to a little child she had adopt

that a month later he met his mother and
asked her for $2000. He received the
amount, returning to her the JBOOO note
and accepted a new note for $4000, which
the mother now seeks to ha" canceled,
because she fears it will be disposed of to
some third party. The case was finally

FACULTY AND STUDENTS
DEPLORE THE RUSH
A FULL INVESTIGATION HAS

It Is Thought That Severe Punish
ment Will Be Meted Out to the
Ringleaders.
BERKELEY. Sept. IS.â The action of
the freshmen and sophomore classes of
i the University of California in Indulging
! in a disgraceful mix-up yesterday morn
ing is universally deplored by both the
members of the faculty and the student
I body. Not only was the fracas a serious
; violation of college rules, but like the act
:of hoodlums. Condemnation is coming
'. from all sides for those who were respon
i sible for the outbreak.
i The faculty have taken the matter up
I and their action is awaited with Interest.
I Professor Thomas R. Bacon and Prof's
sor M. W. Haskell. both of whom assisted
in putting an end to the fight, declare that
it was the most disgraceful incident that
1 has ever happened on the university cam
pus. If the rest of the professors share
! in this feeling it may go hard with the
I students upon whom the blame is finally
i fixed.
The gravity of the situation is seen in
the action of Regent Andrew S. Hallidie,
acting president of the university. Re
j gent Hallidie has appointed a special com-
I mittee consisting of Professor Walter Ma
gee Professor Frank Soule and Colonel
I George C. Edwards to Investigate the
affair and prepare a report. The matter
will also come under the coenizanoe of
the â =â¢.â¢â - affairs committee, to which
Professor Bacon belongs.
Inasmuch as the affair was not a pre
! meditated outbreak it is doubtful whether
i the latter committee will expel from col
lege the hostages of the sophomore class
which it has retains for the purpose of
trying to prevent just such outbreaks ad
that of Friday.
So far no notices have been sent out

nled that anything of the kind had hap
pened in his saloon.
Shank was closely questioned by the
policeman, but all he could get out of
him was that he would know the man
who robbed him, although he was unable
to give any description of him. An effort
will be made to find the robber, but it is
believed to be hopeless.

FOR SELLING MORPHINE
Severn Miller, clerk In R. E. Rockstroh*?
drug store, Seventh and Howard streets,
who was convicted by Judge Graham on
the charge of selling morphine to Ada
Alters, a confirmed "fiend," without a
physician's prescription, appeared for sen
tence yesterday morning.
The Judge sentenced him to three
months' imprisonment in the County Jail
without the option of a fine. "This crime,"
said the Judge, "is worse than robbery,
as it makes physical and mental wrecks
of men and women and should be se
verely punished."
Rockstroh, the proprietor of the drug
store, was recently fined $.?00 by Judge
Treadwell on a similar charge, a^.d the
fine was paid.

Labor Council's Work.
The Labor Council at its session Friday
night received, from Secretary Rosenberg
a report of his labors in the prosecution
of the proprietors of the Union Iron
Works before the Federal court for a
violation of the eight-hour law with men
working on Government ships.
The action was undertaken by the labor
organizations of this city at the instance
of the Boiler-makers' Union, whose men
complained of the Union Iron Works in
particular, as all the other shipbuilders
had recognized the Federal law. The
present prosecution will test the law as
applied to transport vessels undergoing
repairs by contractors.
After a spirited debate and a close vote
of 13 to 13. the section of the Labor Coun
cil constitution which precluded political
nominees from retaining a seat in tho
body of the council was stricken out.
The matter is. however, not decisive, as
It must come up at a future meeting for
final action.
Delegate Charles Slepel was seated from
the Stereotypers* Union, as was T. D.
Conness from the Electrical Workers.
Slebe & Green sent in a communication
requesting a further conference with the

Federal and State
Laws Clash.
BERKELEY, Sept. 16.â Some decidedly
! startling developments are growing out of
; a law case now in progress In the little
court at the university town. The grav
ity ef the affair has never been equaled
, here. As an upshot of the whole thing
: Justice of the Peace Robert Edgar came
within an ace of committing Deputy In
ternal Revenue Collector FranK Fletcher
| to Jail for contempt of court.
Two weeks ago the police arrested
Charles Schmitt, charging him with vio-
I lating the one-mile liquor law. Schmltt is
: the proprietor of a place on Center street,
i below Shattuck avenue. The case against
him Is a strong one from the evidence
gained during the raid made by Marshal
i Lloyd and his deputies. This afternoon
the accused liquor dealer was brought up
for trial. He was represented by Attor
ney M. C. Chapman of Oakland as coun
i sel, Town Attorney Brewton. A. Hayne
â  representing the city.
The ordinary preliminaries of trial had
! been gone through in the customary way
when Attorney Hayne surprised the
courtroom by calling to the stand Deputy
Internal Revenue Collector Fletcher. Up
on Fletcher's testimony the prosecution
expected largely to rest its case. It has
long been known to the police authorities
that revenue collectors have exacted
! money from liquor dealers within the one
j mile limit. It was known to the prosecu
tion that Fletcher had been seen in
Schmitt'3 place. If Fletcher could be
brought to acknowledge that he had col
lected money or had asked for money
from Schmitt the evidence would prove in
valuable to the city.
Fletcher took the stand and was duly
sworn. He admitted being in Schmltt's
place on the date named by the prosecu
tion. But when Attorney Hayne asked
him to relate what was said and done
there the court came to a deadlock.
; Fletcher flatly refused to answer. The
prosecuting attorney argued and ex
! plained. Judge Edgar likewise argued and
i explained. But Fletcher persisted in his
! refusal. When asked for his reasons he
I stated that as a United States official he
! was not at liberty to reveal any Govern
! ernment secrets. Attorney Hayne expos-
I tulated and Judge Edgar expostulated,
but without avail.
It was then that Judge Edgar became
i threatening. He told the witness that
I unless the prosecuting attorney's ques
j tion were answered he would be com
mitted to jail for contempt of court.
Fletcher remained silent, however, and
the court was about to carry out the
threat, when Attorney Hayne intervened.
He asked the court to continue the case
I until Monday, in order that the revenue
i collector might consult with his superiors
ias to the course of action. Judge Edgar
. hesitated, but was disposed finally to
grant the attorney's request, although he
i explained to Fletcher that if next Monday
, '. he still persisted In his refusal he would
i be committed to jail at once.
Aside from the legal technicalities In

States official to testify to the direct

â  | which the whole police force of the uni

GOLDEN JUBILEE OF THE
FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH
RETTNION OF MEMBERS IN HON
OR OF THE OCCASION.
The Past IHscussed and Predictions
Freely Made of the Institution's
Growth in the Future.
Th<Â»re was a reunion Friday night of
the members of the First Baptist Church
to ceiebrare the golden Jubilee of the or
ganisation. The pvi-ning was one of rem
iniscence. The history and growth, the
trials and tribulations of the congrega- ;
tion were the favorite themes of all those
â who made addresses. While there was a
general review of the past, the future was
net overlooked, and th^re were many pre- I
dictions that the prospects were bright I
and that the good work of the church
would so on and Increase as the years
wore away and that the centennial cele
bration would find it in even a more flour
ishing condition than did its golden. Ju
bilee.
The reunion was held in the lecture
room and the Sunday-school apartment of
the church. In the parlors leading off
the lecture-room tables were set for 150 ;
guests, where, following the addresses,
refreshments were serveu to the old mar
ried folk, while the young people who â 
were not inarrieil and those who were en- |
gaged, as the pastor put it, were fed on j
ice cream and cake in the main lecture
room.
In calling the assemblage to order. Rev. '
E. A. Woods, the pastor, called upon the
Almighty to bless the occasion of the re
union, the n&mn, memory and influence ot
the church ar.d the sole surviving repre
sentatives of the founders of the Institu
tion fifty years ago. Mr. and Mrs. John F.
Pope.
Mr. Pop* reviewed the early hlatorv of
the church, dwelling upon the hardships
and struggles of the little congregation
to maintain its house of worship. He said
that he and his wife had been members
of the Baptist church for over sixty yearÂ«
and now that their lease of life had al
most run they calmly and trustfully
awaited the final call. In early days the ;
church numbered among Its membership ;
people from all sections of the country, i
who brought with them different ideas
and customs. There were men from the
South and men from the North, and when
the war broke out members of the con
gregation almost feared to mention to
each other the great national Issues which
then threatened the country. Forbear
ance had marked all Its deliberations and
in the end the church derided to throw 'â â 
Its comparatively feeble strength and in- I
fluence for the maintenance of the Union. â 
The congregation upheld the Vigilance I
Committee and took a prominent part in j
all the public matters that agitated the !
then troubled community. He remarked j
that the devotion of the women of the !
church was one of the features most po
tent in maintaining its existence.
Finances of the church were discussed
by B. C. Wright. He presented figures to
show that during its fifty years the con
gregation had poured Into the pulpit
alone over $150,000. Its choir had cost
$30,000 janitor $17,500, taxes and insurance
$25,000, gas and lights $20,000, repairs $10,000,
interest $77,500. benevolence. $s<>.<*K>. Other
minor items brought the grand total ex
pended by the members for their religious
welfare lip to the neighborhood of half a
million dollars. E. F. Joy talked on the
women's work in the church, and mission-*
ary work was discussed by W. B. Thomp
son A few remarks were made by <*ap
tain M. C. Prindle of the United States
navy and Major W. A. Gilbert, paymaster
in the army.
The exercises in connection with the
golden Jubilee will close with Sundays
services at the church.

But that Federal officers should have been

DEBT COLLECTORS FREED
BY FEDERAL GRAND JURY
OAKLAND, Sept. 16.â The sending of
Information regarding a man's Insolvency
through the mails upon a postal card is
not a felony. Nor is it any offense, pre
sumably, against the postal laws. A
Federal Grand Jury has handed in an
opinion stating that It has decided to Ig

and Hobson, debt collectors of this city.
This matter has excited much attention
since the arrest of the conecting arm
some months ago for sending to W. H.
Stanlels of A'.ameda a card informing him
of the dismissal of his insolvency peti
tion by Judge Hall. This action was con
sidered as being In the nature of a threat
by the Federal authorities, and was re

Just decided there was" nothing in the
presumption of criminality, as the Insol

Fruitvale Election In
validated.
Oakland Office San Francisco Ca'.l,
908 Broadway, Sept. 16.
The election held at Fruitvale to-day for
the purpose of determining the question
of imposing: a tax to raise $1000 for the
maintenance of the flre district in that
quiet and picturesque suburb of Oakland
for the next twelve months was knocked
Into a cocked hat In a way that bespeaks
some of the wonders that can be accom
plished through the clever manipulations
of politics.
The quiet suburb is rapidly growing and
Is already thickly settled. That the dis
trict needs a fire department of some sort
has long been apparent, but there are
many residents who beiieve that they are
already taxed overmuch, hence there was
a bitter opposing faction at to-day's elec
tion.
The election officers had been duly
named, and the polling place, on East
Fourteenth street, between Fruitvale ave
nue and Bassett street, selected.
During the early hours of the morning
but few appeared at the polls, and there
was but one election officerâ R. Campbellâ
on duty. At noon the poll was closed
while the officers went off for their noon
day lunch. They had not gone far nor
long when several electorsâ presumably
of the opposition faction â called at the
poll, and tinding the place deserted we c
thus deprived of the privilege of casting
their votes, a fact which, under the law,
invalidates the election.
The electors thus deprived went away
angered, and the news of the invalida
tion was soon the chief topic Â«f talk at
every street corner in town. It was very
evident that the majority of property
(wntn are against the tax, and it is
even hinted that the opposing forces in
duced the election officers to do as they
did in order that the election might be
invalidated.
"At least two-thirds of the people here
In Fruitvale are opposed to the tax," said
G. R. Warren, a prominent resident of the
suburb, this evening, "and there is quite
r strong sentiment prevailing in fa\
consolidation with Oakland. I understand
that there were but ninety votes cast at
to-day's election, and that the majority
was against the tax for fire department
purposes." _______ ______

The Hay Market.
The circular of Scott & Magner says: "We
have received 4251 toes of Hay on this market i
during the past week. Arrivals by rail would
have been much heavier if the railroad was
In a position to handle the amount of Hay
being offered It for shipment. As It is, :
shipments by rail are held back for some days ]
en account of the want of trackage here in I
the city lor the reception and unloading of j
cars. There is not much change to report la ,
the market conditions. Consignments are sell- i
ing very well as they arrive, and the feeling i
throughout is fair steady."
Alfalfa Hayâ While arrivals are fairly lib- j
eral, the demand at this time is quite active,
and offerings have sold readily and the market
can be quoted as firm. Choice offerings find â 
very ready sale, and the medium grades,
while they do cot move off as readily, still \
are being satisfactorily placed.
Straw â The demand for this article has been !
first rate, and consignments are being readily |
sold at the following figures: Choice Barley t
Straw, 35c; No. 1 lots of Barley or of Wheat j
Straw, 27%332%c per bale."

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nezv York Stock Market.
KTCW TORK, Sept. 18.â appearance of
the bank statement effectually dispersed all the
encotrragin* Illustrations that speculative hold
ers of securities have been indulging for several
flays past and threw the market Into demoral
lzatic^i. Prices were offered down by plunges,
and very heavy blocks were liquidated appar
ently for what they would bring. The local
traction stocks were a special mark, seemingly
on the theory that they had not responded
adequately In sympathy with Brooklyn Tran
sit. Metropolitan slumped an extreme 14%
points and Manhattan 8. Brooklyn Transit it
self was somewhat relieved from the recent
v-re pressure and held firmly at ES or above
through most of the storm in the late mar
ket The other Flower stocks were fiercely at
tacked People's Gas dropped nearly 4, Rock
Island IK and Federal Steel 1%. Sugar fell
an extreme 4- 9 and Tobacco ~\. Losses else
where In the specialties extended between 2
end 3 points In numerous cases. St. Paul suf
fered from continued liquidation even before
the late break, a.-.d after the bank statement
appeared It dropped an extreme l%i to ll*.
Many Â«-allroad stocks fell a point or over. The
violent declines Invited the taking of some
quick profits by the bears, which caused fever
ish rallies. In Metropolitan the rally reached
over 3 points. But the tone of the speculation
at the closing was completely demoralized, and
prices in many cases were still being offered
down rapidly In the frantic efforts of holders
to unload. The losses in cash by the banks
for the week were over $2,000,000 less than had
been foreshadowed by the known movements,
but on the other hand a contraction In loans
had been expected to reach as high as 125.000,
--000 according to some estimate?. As the re
firns showed a reduction of only 57,845,400 in
loans the net result brought the surplus re
serves down to about a quarter of a million
dollars of the lÂ»en! requirement. Stocks held
en marjfin and with borrowed money have been
forced to sale In large volume during the week,
â¢with resulting raids on thÂ« market prices
reaching a considerable figure In some cases.
Last Saturday's bank statement showing re
serves of a number of the clearing-house ln
ttitutlonH already below their legal limit, made
It certain that there would be loan contraction
and the bears were eager to anticipate the
Exiling which was in prospect. Rates for call
loans were marked up on Monday and Tum
d!Â»y by rpafon of the eager bidding of the
â¢would-b* i lowers, who were seeking to shift
loar.g which had been called. The volume of
liquidation indicated clearly enough that many
w<>re unable to get accommodations even at
thÂ« higher level. The bears sold bo Indus
triously that their endoavor to cover short con
tracts worked a sharp rally on Wednesday,
wh?n the banks cased to call in loans, and the
pressure of forced liquidation was relaxed.
But whon the demand from th* shorta was
Fatisflfd thÂ« market fell back again. The re
actionary tendency was emphasized by the re
fusial of the St. Paul directors to extend the
disbursements of the larger surplus earnings
of the year beyond the regular dividend rate.
The decision was calculated to have thÂ». more
effect on the railroad stocks since many stocks
have been lifted on speculative buying based
en *-xpect*tion of increased dividends, few
of thwse stocks can show as large a surplus
of current earnings as St. Paul, ana many are
in far more urgent need of expenditures on
structure and equipment In order to increase
the operating efficiency. The annual report
of nearly every Important railroad that comes
to hand contains the same etory of aimlnlsn
lnir rates for transportation.
Ton-nili* revenue was never so low betore
a'Â»d is still declining, and the further rnduc
tt-j'is In ton-rnl!e cost of operation thus maae
necessary |B only to be ach!eve<l bjr enormous
outlays of capital for Improving roadbeds and
tra equipment and structures, putting 1 down
of pra'les so as to make possible the carryinsr
of heavier tmtnloads. The relaxation of the
money stringency after the banks had reduced
their liabilities on account of loans lea to an
optimistic midweek view of the money outlook,
which however, was not long: maintained. i
Somewhat exaggerated effect wm produced on j
j sentiment by the decision of the Treasury De- |
partment to anticipate the payment of October
1 interest on Government bonds. Last year's
experience In a similar period of stock market
i need of money demonstrated that holders of j
Government bonds were not Inclined to avail
. themselves of the offered privilege. The relief
I at tx?st would be small and is not immediate-
Ily available. With continued demand for cash
I In sight, both from the Treasury and from in-
I terior money centers, no source of replenish
i ment ti discernible. Bankers, In fact, express
themselves as well content with the existing .
I rate lor money, and are not disposed to seek
I means for relief of speculative borrowers. They .
hold the view that a check on undue specula- |
tion and a weeding out of weak speculative ac- '
i counts makes for the safety of the financial ;
j fabric. The causes of the firmness of sterling '
j exchange with money rates in New York far
I above the London level and a supposed credit
\ balance In our favor or many millions does
i not find very adequate explanation. There are
' Â£ald to have been large receipts from abroad '
1 of securities, but selling from that source has i
, not been In evidence through the regular j
agencies. Foreign houses in New York have I
lent money here during the week. The pur- j
i pose may be to ease the money rate and so !
defer the pressure on London for gold until j
the Transvaal crisis has resolved itself in some
â way.
Bonds have moved In sympathy with stocks,
but not as widely. United States 6s advanced
X In the bid price.

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â The Financier says:
The clearing-house banks of New York, ac
cording to their report for the week ending
September 16. lost about $8,000,000 In cash as a
result of the previous sir days' operations.
More than half of this was absorbed by the
treasury an.', the rest went to the Interior. The
banks reported September 9 less than $3,000,000
cash over legal requirements so that the de
crease for tiie current week was larger than
the available fund from which to draw it. The
result, neÂ«Â»<iiess to 6ay, was accomplished by a
heavy contraction in leans, with a resultant
shrinkage in deposits. Despite the loss, there
fore, the banks still hold $276,450 more reserve
than required by law. Practically they have
reached the limit cf their power to supply new
money, and future demands must be met by
renewed operations of the character namedâ
that is. borrowers will be called upon to liquid
ate their indebtedness. This foreshows, ma
terially, a continued hard money market, al
though rates do not â to be able to hold
above 6 per cent under circumstances that or
dinarily would indicate money famine. The
truth of the matter Is that the situation is well
understCKxl that there is no apprehension what
ever. If money works much higher in New
York the idle surpluses which are held else
whore will be Immediately forwarded to this
center, with a consequent lessening pressure.
The trouble ir m a banking standpoint is the
heavy drain which the treasury is making on
banks. The loss since the end of July has been
upward of seventeen millions, a sum much
greater than has gone to the interior. When
this drain is relieved all trouble over the future
will be eliminated. At present, however, It is
a serious fact, One year ago. It may be re
mark'-'l. the excess reserve of the New York
banks was only about five millions, but a few
weeks later the total had risen to over twenty
millions. â¢".-â ld imports assisted in creating this
increase. There is no immediate sign that last
year's method of recuperating Is to be re
peated now.
London Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 16.â The Commercial Ad

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 16.â advance In quota
tions In Liverpool gave wheat a firm feeling
at thÂ« opening, with the prices ranging about
half a cent higher all around. The strength at
Liverpool due to the critical condition of af
fairs in the Transvaal brought a number of
yesterday sellers into the market, and buy-
Ing from this source while it lasted kept prices
up for deferred futures well above yesterday's
closing point. The trading, however, was con
fined almost entirely to local operators, and
when shorts had satisfied their wants the mar
ket was allowed to drift. For the remainder
of, the short Saturday session the tendency was
steadily downward. Receipts at primary points
were heavy, and this, coupled with a poor cash
demand, few of Friday's offers being accepted,
encouraged the bear element. Selling. pressure
was light at all times, but the buying demand
was so slack that little liquidation sufficed to
depths prices. In September more strength
was shown. There was almost nothing done,
but elevator selling was totally absent and the
price at all times held at a good advance.
Weakness in the deferred futures became more
pronounced .toward the close, when for the
first time liquidation assumed respectable pro
portions. Atlantic sort clearances of wheat
and flour amounted to 600,000 bushels. Snow's
weekly " crop report estimated the total
wheat crop at about 630,000,000 bushels, and
predicted the Government's report on the acre
age would probably be revised. This had some
effect. December opened. %c to He h:Â«rher at
71V4S'l%c, and gradually declined to 70%@70>ic.
closing- at 70Â«4c. September sold between TIVÂ»'U>
71'ic and 70?ic. and closed %c higher at 71Â»fcc.
Corn in the main followed wheat, though de
ferred futures did not develop so much weak
ness. There was an active demand for Septem
ber from shorts, who found some difficulty In
covering. September at one time sold as high
as 33c. and closed %c higher at 32%e. De
cember closed Ho higher at 2S%f?2STsc.
There was a good demand for all oat fu
tures early In." the session, but later the â  de
mand slackened and . prices receded. Decem
ber closed unchanged and September %c lower.
Provisions were dull but steady. Prices were
a little higher at thÂ« opening with grain mar
kets and kept within a narrow range through
out A good export demand for meats was a
feature. At the close January Dork -was .Be i
higher, lard 2%<55c higher and ribs 2%c higher.

percentage of the Oats which will find their
way here will be badly discolored. What ef
fect this will' have upon the market Is hard
to determine as yet. That it should stiffen
the price for good bright Oats of til kinds
goes without saying, but prices of Inferior of

good grain or Hay of any kind. At this writ-

authorizing the establishment of com

eligible to honorary membership. As

i such a companion court. .L...-U
lay night court Xerba Buena No.

tary. He spoke of the Bdvantagea that

pointment as supreme deputy organizer
to enable him to proceed with the organi
sation ut a companion court to Court

in other orders it is one that will re
dound to the benefit of all courts that
follow the lead of Court Yerba Buena.

tlon, there was no decrease greater than |
is usual the year round. In some of the

evidence that the membership ajjproves
the change made by the supreme body.

"V 'V* "\ HEN George Dewey, admiral
\ A / sails into New York harboi
W \/ late this month he will be th<
*" ' most talked of man in thÂ»
world and the best loved man
In America. Only Dreyfus has occupied
so large a Â»hare of public thought, dur
ing the months since Dewey left Ma
nila, and Dreyfus' prominence has been
that notoriety, not. fame.
"If the money that is to be spent on
Dewey's reception should be weighed
up In â liver," said a statistical - fiend,
"it would be pretty nearly as heavy as
i the aggregate weight of the shot he
; fired at the Spanish ships."
Whether this is true or not is of no
possible consequence, but it is certain
ly a fact that America has never so
nearly approached a national fit of af
fectionate hysteria as she will on the
day the hero of. the Philippines comes
home. It will be like the meeting, of a
sweetheart with her lover after a long
separation. Miss Columbia's arms are
widely spread and she >viil hug George
Dewey fervently.
I have been in New York and on
for a good many years, and 'it has
been my business to Bee its big events.
There has never been a eel I ration in
honor of any one man approaching the
Dewey reception in magnitude. Al
ready, almost throe weeks before the
admiral â  is scheduled .to arrive, his
name is the wor-l heard in every group
of men from 'the stevedores on the
docks to the millionaires in the Union
League Club; already, the novelty mak
ers are putting their .Dewey badges on
sale on the streets and getting their
Dewey bunting ready to fly from every
place in town which can offer holding
room for a waving, cole/red rag. Dare
and ugly timbers hide the . fronts of
â cores of houses and business buildings
before which the great parade will pass;
6mall speculators have staked their all
in renting space. Streetcar companies
are figuring out ways by which they
can keep their cars away from certain
crowded streets and still transport the
crowd cabmen are reckoning on a
great harvest in the glorious twenty
four hours of Dewey's day; hotels are
furbishing up their rooms and restau
rants are buying food supplies long in
advance; all New York is getting ready
to receive the admiral.

Not Ires than a million people will bÂ«

timate of the general passenger agent
of the New York Central.
Hundreds of thousands of people will
be disappointed In their efforts to see
the admiral as he passes along the line

are not as complete as it was hoped
they would be. Mayor Van "Wyck'i
private secretary, Mr. Downs, who hÂ«u,
had much to do with the arrangement*
for the celebration, says that not more

The great feature of New York's
preparations will consist of the colossal"
arch and colonnade on Fifth avenue,
where it will be Hanked by the famous
Madison' square and the Fifth-avenue
Hotel. This is the outgrowth of patriot
ism pure and simple. The Idea was put
forward by C. R. Lamb, a well-known
decorator. He told of it to J. Q. A.
Ward, the famous sculptor.
"The city will furnish the money If
the sculptors will do the work." eaid
Mr. Lamb. "But I don't suppose the
sculptors will do the work."
"The sculptors will do the work." said
Mr. Ward, "but the city will not fur

Mr. Ward did suggest the plan to the
Sculpture Society. They took it up
with a good will that carried it through
in one night. The city government was
scarcely less prompt in appropriating
the money for materials and workmen.
There was a hitch in the Issuance of
the bonds, but it was caused by a com

Mrs. H. J. Cusack, who has already
become famous for the charming hats
and bonnets she constructs from corn
husks, has surpassed all former at
tempts in her art this year.
Three bonnets which she hus con
structed for Mir. William McKinley,
Queen Victoria and Miss Helen Gould
are marvels of exquisite taste and
workmanship. Mrs. McKinley's is a
dainty evening bonnet in the natural
corn husk. The frame Is braided to
Imitate an Imported straw, it la
trimmed with Marechal Neil roses, re
lieved by sofi black rosettes. Queen
Victoria's bonnet is a Marie Stuart
shape in royal purple braid, passion
flowers and knots of cream colored
husks form the trimming. Miss Gould's
hat is not more beautiful than the
others, but it presents nearly a month
of arduous labor. The hat is fash
ioned after a Paris pattern, sent to Mrs.
Cusack for the purpose; it has a high
crown and rolling brim, lavishly
trimmed with violets of every shade of
purple. Near the bark ami beneath tho
brim is a cluster of tea roses. The
Khapp itself bo closely resembles a Tus
can bra id ihat it is almost beyond de
tectlon. The liatw and trimmings are
entirply made '<f corn husks, of course,
prepared Â«nd dried.
Many others have picked up the art
of making corn husk hats, and for two
weeks before the carnival many girls
who could nql wail until the stated day
to show their new millinery have
bravely sallied forth in their corn husk
h;its. Tiny are, many of them, fully

Just why Ato'TiTins have a peculiar na

explained, nor has the twenty-first annual
congress of the American Laryngologies,]
Society, which lms just been concluded,
thrown much lisht on the subject. The
opinions expressed by the various throat
specialists upon the subject were so di
verse ami scientific that the layman in
left but little the wiser.
One point, however, received universal
aoceptance, nii'l that â was that the cli

Invariably described with the term "Yan

the New England States, but hat spread
all over the continent, and as the rli
mate varies almost to extremes through
out the country, it was scarcely fair to
ascribe to it all the changes that take
lilare in the larynx and vocal cords, and
which produce the unpleasant twang.
Dr. Shedson Makuen of Philadelphia
told the association that he attributed the

tension of American life. When a person
is excited or hurried the voice always be
e imi h pitched, and it does not tn.ke
long bi ire the habit is formed and the
voice assumes v nasal twang.
To show that it was not a question of
race that would account fur the twang of
the American voice, like the guttural
voice of tin Dutch or the peculiar type
of nasal voice of the French, it was
pointed out that our English cousins had
voices of an agreeably low pitch. Com
paratively few Englishmen suffer from
nasal catarrh or affection of the larynx,
while it is the exception to find an Ameri
can who Is unaffected by some similar
ffection It might very well lie the case
the nasal i wang is the cause of the
larynx being affected instead of what Is
nllj believed the nasal twang being
â¢I by the nasal catarrh.
Still another specialist, Dr. Thomas
11 hhard of Toledo, advanced the theory
that high pitched voices were caused by

lÂ»r. John W. l'arlow of Boston ascribed
to Immigration a great number of hlzzare
sounds that have crept Into the spoken
iage. Guttural sounds were Intro
duced by the Germans and Dutch, while
a number of nasal sounds were brought
Into use by French Canadians. The result
was that the American had grown care-
Icss as to the best way of using his voice
and had a kind of mongrel speech. People
fall into the conversational habits of the

the present volume, "The Mandate," is
realism of another sort. The key to the
tale Is found on the title page in a verse
by George Meredith:
"In tragic life. God wot

For there is no villain in the story and
passions, the strongest; truly spin the
plot. Three nines In a miserable life dis

good ringing note when Bounded alone,
one a sweet pathetic note, but both much
out of tune, with a third hopelessly off
pitch. Paula, the heroine is pitiable,
lovable, indefensible â a perfectly amiable
and virtuous woman who does not love
her husband. "She had married open
eyed and without Illusions a man most
infinitely her inferior; had married him
with scornful tolerance, believing she
could always dominate him, could always
go her way and keep htm in his own
place. She had huckstered her own beauty
against wealth, believing herself, after
all. assured of the better side of .the bar
gain. Finding her" husband more despic
able than she had deemed, the conveni
ence of her position less than she had
anticipated, she had no right to repine."
Such a bargain is always a base one, no
matter what the circumstances. In
Paula's case th< y were but remotely If at
all justifiable. She was the oldest of four
daughters of a poor clergyman and much
in the way 'if her stepmother. And so she
married John St. Kelvin, a journalist and
promoter of mining schemes, a perfectly
commonplace brute with a brain, who,
when he ceased to drink, through the in
fluence of suggested hypnotism, was over
mastered with a lust of cruelty.
"The exorcised devil of drink" gave
place to the more Intolerable demon of
violence. " in the words of the author:
"The tragical purl of such marriages is
the opportunity which they afford to that
odd immoral destiny which sometimes

the drink habit. When Paula reveals her

St. Kelvin becomes unbearable, Paula
comes to Massie for protection. Tie helps
her to find a home outside of London, safe
from the possible annoyance of her hus
band, avoids St. Kelvin thereafter and
deeply desires his death. In an evil hour,
after a day spent by Massie in the British
Museum, reading Binet and Frere on hyp
notism, he meets him at the club. St. Kel
vin, who has discovered that Massie keeps
him from drinking, tells him in a rage
that he has taken all the satisfaction out
of his life for the last two months and
whines to lie released from the spell. Mas-
Bie agrees, takes him to his rooms, puts
him under hypnotic power, tells him he Is
to drink in future, to his heart's content
and be damned, and coursing through his
brain all this time were certain words of
Binet and Frerc: "Death may bo caused
by suggestion!" This is his opportunity
and he suggests death and becomes at
lie-art a murderer. Within the night the
crime accomplishes itself. Tie and Paula
marry, hut the ghost of St. Kelvin follows
him about, makes of life a bell and finally
makes of him a raving maniac.
The characters of Mangle and St. Kel

the latter, a man who habitually reeked

a libertine, not a disturber of domestic

At Every Local Election
Their Vote Will Be Two
Hundred Stronger Than
at the Election Previous.
THE political arena of San Francisco
Is about to become the recipient
of a new force. Not only will it
be new to San Francisco, but it
will be new to the United States,
for while all European nationalities are
mow or less colonised in politics, the field
has heretofore been free of any offspring
of Asia. Now. however, the Asiatic unit
has girded his loins and Is prepared to
make himself felt. The Chinese are ex
cluded from citizenship, It Is true; but
this inhibition does not extend to their
progeny bom upon American soil. They
Â»rÂ«. under the constitution and laws of
the' United States, citizens by right of
birth. One thousand of these, males and
of full voting age, are now numbered
among the denizens of Ban Francisco's
Chinatown, and scattered throughout the
State there are no less than 4000 more.
These will all vote In the next election.
This announcement may be somewhat
startling to the State and local politi
cians, but their number and character
presents a factor to be taken Into con
sideration in the making up of the slates
of thÂ« future.
There are SCOO male Chinese chil
dren of all ages below majority In
Ban Francisco, and throughout the State
there are about 6000 more. These were
ail born In the United States, and
hence are citizens. They are coming
to majority at a rate of about 260 a
year about 100 of whom are residents of
San Francisco. Consequently It may be
said that in even' local election the Chi
nese vote will be 300 stronger than at the
election previous, and at each State elec
tion It will be 1000 stronger than It was
at the preceding count.
It can be seen, therefore, that the Chi
nese vote is destined to become a most
effective engine In politics. This can be
realize when it Is understood that these
voters will stand and ballot upon every
principle and every candidate as a unit.
Vo other vote is or can be bo homogene
ous The Irish. German. Scandinavian.
Italian votes have certain communal in
terests which they always severally assert
about election times, but even their so

specified â¢ number of votes. With this
new element the condition may be ex-
Jected to be widely different. Its integrals
will be under the influence of a central
head, who will point out to them their
Interests In politics and direct them the
way they should stand; and it Is beyond
The perad^nture of a doubt that these
semi-celestials will be guided by and will
obey this chief. v^- â¢'--'
Such a chief has already been found
and the organization through which he Is
clothed with powers is in existence. The
man is Robert L. Parke and the corpora
tion is the Tung Yuen Chung Gok. which
in English means " United Parlor of
Native Sons." or. as the incorporat on
papers have It. "Native Sons of he
Golden State." This organization Is. he
second of the kind to arise in California.
Five years ago there was a charter
granted by thÂ© Legislature to a Tong -et
native sons under the leadership of one
Ling Vow. The charter gathered under
Its folds about 200 members, but the affair
did not prosper, owing to the detracting
influences of Mr. Ling's business, which
was that of a drummer for a fruit can
ning establishment, requiring him to
make trips about the State and be much
cf the time away from the city. Lpon
the ashes of this concern grew the exist
ing Tong which was brought Into life
through another charter, and dates its
existence from May 11. 1595.
Mr. Parke is its president. It has the
second floor of a building on Powell
street on the northern edge of Chinatown
for its quarters, and here once a week
meetingÃ are held at which about 300
members gather and Mr. Parke presides.
While this parlor has been in existence
for three years, it has only been recently
that the management has aroused to a
definite purpose of going Into politics.
The first conception was to identify and
secure the assemblage of the American
born Chinese, then get them acquainted
with the organization as an instrument of
fraternal amalgamation. The parlor
therefore undertook to procure employ
ment for Idle members; to assist members
who were in poverty, to comfort the siok
and bury the dead; In short to distribute
as much brotherhood among themselves
as the limited funds of the affair, raised
from contributions of membership fees,
would allow. Alongside of this Quality of

j heroically designed and lavishly decor
i ated.
This was one night's work. The nÂ«*xt
', day the sculptors were hard at work on
j their designs, and within a week the
models were growing in their studios.
To J. Q. A. Ward was naturally in
trusted the task of making the great
group for the top of the arch. Prancing
sea horses drawing Victory's barge
through curling waves, with Liberty
at the helm, was his subject. Two
weeks he had to complete his model In â
work which ordinarily would have oc
cunied as many months. And the task,
the glory of the reason for it. inspired
him. Done In haste the great group will
be but hurried in appearance it will
not be.
And so with the two great groups
which will appear on the sides of the
arch's downtown front. Niehaus and
Karl Bitter took them up with the same,
impulsive enthusiasm, and the sea war
riors returning to their home with Vic
tory's wings spread over th^m will
stand out on the Dewey arch not only
as evidences of the intense patriotism
which animated the idea, but as sam-
Dles of good art. Philip Martigni. Dan
iel C French. F. W. Ruchstuhl, George
E Bissell, Charles A. Lopez, Isadore
Conti and many othersâ nearly all the
members of the Sculpture Society, In
factâ have done as much. Never have
the atudios of New York's workers at
â trong social flavor. The Chinese arÂ«
proverbially clannish, but this Is shown
specifically when they are confronted
with Interests of other nationalities,
between themselves they are selfish,
jealous, rusplclouÃ and Individual enough.
It was to overcome these tenden
cies that the social phase of
the movement was carefully fos
tered. Convivial parties were given,
there were crude "Â©vents" which as
sembled the multitude, a little rice wine
was distributed upon occasion, ex
changes of ideas supervened, and ulti
mately the Native Sons acquired the
reputation throughout the Kwang Tung
province of San Francisco of being a
band of Jolly good fellows, membership
of whose body came to be desired by
every American born Chinese In the
district, and the ardent ambition of all
those whose approaching majority would
entitle them to admission.
The social advantages and felicities as
well as the material benefits of the parlor
being well established, the movement has
lately come to take upon itself the real
phase which has all along been the
primary object In the mind of
its organizer, namely, a political
status. The Native Sons have had
careful drilling. It has been Im
pressed upon them that their condition 13

they axe entitled to vote and that this

policy and Its administrator!. Scarcely
Is there one of them who cannot cite
sections of the constitution of the United
States by heart, and cannot explain In
telligently the division of powers be
tween the Federal arrangements and the
States.
These Jovial youths all speak English;
the vernacular of some of them is of the
winged pigeon variety, but they can
nevertheless make themselves understood,
and can with quite agile alacrity "catchee
on" to the meaning of their conversation
ist. Only a few of them are of parents
well-to-do, for there are few such In
Chinatown; the greater number are poor
and of Ignorant paternity. Upon general
lines they are ignorant themselves, but
specifically they are bright and ready;
this readiness abides In the direction of
their political interests which It has been
the care of Mr. Parke to inculcate In
them.
In appearance the native son generally
is not distinguishable from a foreign
born. Bave through his youth. His occu
pation holding him close to his own peo

cluding the queue; a few of them dress In
the American garb, and this is disported
by Mr. Parke himself, but paternal pro-
this art been so busy. Vacations have
been curtailed. Other orders have been
put aside. Nothing has been permitted
to stand In the way of making the home
romlng of our great Admiral a beauti
ful as well as an enthusiastic occasion.
"All this has another significance,"
Mr. Ward said. He was hard at work
on the touches needed to finish his
great group. His years sit lightly on
him. The tale of time told by his gray
hair and pointed white beard is belied
by the athletic lines of his active fig
ure. He is no plush-jacketed sculptor
dabbling daintily. He wore a white,
clay-spattered undershirt that day, and
his trousers were the overalls of the
hard-working hod-carrier. He profess
edly was pleased with all parts of life
except his own group (which stood in
brown, shining clay behind him on a
turning standard), and modesty alone
made him slight the merits of that.
Two assistants were working with the
mud which filled the great clay chest
In one corner of the enormous room,
and they were visibly proud of their
master and of his work.
Mr. Ward beamed benignly.
"It all means more than we see on
the surface," he admitted. "It means
the coming of a great thing to New
Tork and to America. From time im
memorial It has been said that we
lacked public spirit and especially that
as a people we lacked artistic appre
ciation. What could be more publio
spirited than the way the country la

The parlor now includes In Its member

As yet no attempt has been made to or
ganize branch parlors In other parts of the
State, but arrangements are now pending
to start one in Los Angeles and one In
Sacramento. It is expected that each of
these parlors will open with 150 members.

installed in it. He will establish branches
wherever there are enough ellglbles to
maintain such, and these will all take
their mandates from San Francisco. In
time, and within a very little time, the
native-born Chinese throughout the State
will be compactly organized and consoli
dated, ready to swing as a column right
or left, however their interests may de
flect them.
The identity and character of the In
fluence or force which will ewlng this
column is a matter of the highest inter
est. Undoubtedly, It will be personal and
that person will be Mr. Park*. This indi
vidual is about 25 years old and was born
in Chinatown. His parents were nominal*
and are now superannuated and shelved.
I asked Mr. Parke what his father did;
he replied "nothing;." and qulokly chang
ed the subject. It wu obvious thÂ«,t Mr.
"Dewey's coming has a significance
whioh none of us dreamed it would
have. He brings with him not only
the laurel wreaths of a fighter's vic
tories but he has started a movement,
without knowing it himself, which will
be of incalculable artistic benefit to
the American people. Our cities have
been by no means as slow in such mat
ters as they have been credited with
being. Every American city of size
has many things to its credit on Art's
books. But nothing of the magnitude
of these Dewey decorations has ever
been started on pure enthusiasm in
any city in America. The whole thing
will be an object lesson to the sculp
tors. It will prove to them that the
people and those who are elected to
govern them are not wholly out of
sympathy with artists and art feeling
as they have been supposed to be. It
will be an object lesson to the people.
It will show them how greatly art can
add to a demonstration of this kind,
and will also prove to them that the
artists of New York are as patriotio
as any one is and more than ready to
co-operate with other citizens in add
ing to the glory of a great national
event."
The construction of this arch Is
much more Interesting than the build
ing of any other similar structure has
been, because of the great haste with
which it is being done. It was only
three weeks ago that the first inclos
ure of pine boards was put up In the
street where the arch now stands, al
most completed. At that time the
sculptors had not entirely finished any
of their models and all that could be
erected before these were finished was
the bare framework of the arch. At
the earn* time that tbia board fence

Is pre-eminently Americanâ that of look
ing at things as they areâ and even
though such object may be the author of
his being he is not swerved by any false
notions concerning it.
In brief, the whole ganglion of Confu
cian precepts and postulates, with Its
Joss houses, rice papers and combustible
prayers, has been thrown overboard by
Mr. Parke, who Is not only not a pagan
but is a Presbyterian of the full-fledged,
dry-wine type, who chants hymns, reads
Scripture and has morals as straight as
the tight string on a plumb bob.
In fact, Mr. Parke Is by profession a
teacher, and is now about to open a Pres
byterian mission day school in China
town, through which he will teach the
future disciples of his political guidance
the linguistic intricacies and idioms of the
English primer, and the trick of comput
ing numerals with fln-de-siecle lead-pencil
facility. The presence of such a character
in the practical politics of San Francisco
is certainly as extraordinary as the ag
gregation which he heads, and he embod
ies a personage very different from what
would commonly be expected to surge to
the fore in suoh a movement.
Mr. Parke was the first Chine** to
graduate from a grammar school of San
Francisco, his alma mater of this grade
being the Lincoln Grammar School, whose
examination he passed in 1892. There
have only been three Chinese graduates
from grammar schools in the city since,
and they both evolved this year; two of
these passed from the Washington Gram
mar and one from the Claremont School.
After getting through the grammar school
Mr. Parke attended the high school, and
graduated there and finally took a special
course at the University of California,
which he has Just completed.
The first suggestions of an education as
well as the earliest glimmer of the power
of politics came to him through Colonel
F. A. Bee, for years Chinese Consul of
San Francisco. Colonel Bee was an Ameri
can who during the plug-ugly days of
Keameyism took up the defense of the
Chinese who were being persecuted by
that debauch. So successful was he in this
that the Chinese Emperor wrote him a
personal letter and rewarded him with the
office of Consul, which he retained until
his death. Parke was his servant, and

was put up in the middle of Fifth ave
nue, the basement of Madison Square
Garden was turned into a great and
interesting workshop. It was there
that the sculptors' models were to be
enlarged from small clay images into
heroic figures ready for position on
the arch. From twenty to sixty men
were employed in this work and their
manner of going at it was strange to
the layman's eye. First of all a small
square frame was put over the artist's
mi>*el. This was notched by inches
ana from each notch a plumb line of
black thread was dropped until it
struck some important point on the
model itself. After these had been
carefully adjusted a similar and much
larger square frame was built and
hung at a height somewhat above the
point where the completed statue was
to reach. From this plumb lines ex
actly corresponding to the little ones
hanging from the smaller square were
dropped, and these marked the relative
positions of the measured points in
the larger statue.
There was no chipping of marble,
no delicate chiseling with fine tools
in this vast sculptors' studio. The
mass of the figures was built up of
common excelsior dipped in plaster.
White spattered workmen piled hand
ful upon handful of this crude mate
rial up until It approximated the shape
.of the figure to be imitated. After
this was accomplished they took any
road to Rome. With chisels and knives
they chipped the plaster off; with
hatchets they hacked at it; with
saws they sawed it; with round-ended
sticks they modeled it; with brooms
they swept it. Then came the artists

"Primarily we shall see that the Chinese
citizens are registered." said Mr. Parke
in discussing the purposes and future of
his organization recently. "We "are Ameri
cans, and we shall all claim the right of
franchise. China is disheveled and break-
Ing up; who can say he is a member of
the Chinese nation or a subject of its
Government when the Indications are that
It will presently be no more of a nation
than the Jews are a nation and when the
Government is so weak that It is dying
of paresis? If we were not Americans we
would be nothing; our fathers are Just
now in this anomalous predicament. De
nied citizenship of the U.nted State* they
are in reality denationalized; they are
men without a country.
"After we get our men naturallxed,"
continued Mr. Parke. "we will see to It
also that each man votes. At least, we
will be satisfied that nothing stands in
the way of his voting if he wishes to do
so, and our great effort has been to edu
cate our boys that it 1b not only their
right, but It Is their duty to vote, even
though the exercise of such Involves some
personal discomfort and Inconvenience.
We shall vote at all elections. "We shall
ask for a representation In whatever con
ventions we elect to enter, and we pro
pose to assert an influence in the making
up of the tickets as well as in the suc
cess of such. Through our votes we
â hall control the seats from our district
In both the supervisorial board and that
of education, and I can see no reason why
our man may not go to the Legislature
from the Chinatown legislative district
and we shall have a strong pull on the
Senate. Of course I cannot say that the
Chinese will vote in every instance as a
unit; they may vote as they please; but
we are together in a single organization
and we shall in afl probability make up
a ticket from the nominees of the several
parties, and the ticket when so made up
will be the one we will vote.
"You can rely upon this." he continued,
"that the Chinese vote will never be cast
for a man whose record shows him to be
or ever to have been against Chinese in
terests. What will we oppose? Primar
ily, of course, the exclusion laws. We
cannot see why our father's countrymen
should be the victims of such unfair dis
crimination that they are made by the
laws a sort of debased race. We cannot
travel from one part of this continent to
the other unless we are equipped with
passports and pictures of identification,
and if we leave the country we must pro
vide ourselves with a mass of credentials
In order to be permitted to return to our
homes. This must be done away with.
If it cannot be effected through treaties
based upon the amicabilities which must
follow the extension of American trade
In China, then it must be blotted out
through the votes of Chinese Americans.
"We shall in time demand, too, that the
Chinese be admitted to citizenship on the
same- terms as any other nation. There
Is no reason why in this country of gov
ernment by the people a large body of
the people should be under the same dis
ability as are paupers, idiots and Indians
ânot taxed. A man's right to vote should
depend, not upon the site of his birth, but
upon his Intelligence, his understanding
of and fidelity to the Government under
which he lives. Fifteen per cent of the
real estate in Chinatown is owned by
resident Chinese. There was a time when
40 per cent of it was so owned, but
after the passage of the discriminating
laws the situation took on a menacing
attitude of persecution and many Chinese
capitalists sold out their holdings, re
duced their property to gold and with It
sailed back to China. There are 400 stores
In Chinatown and their taxable stocks
will average $7000 each. I know gentle
men there who pay taxes on $35,000, $40,000
and as high as $50,000 worth of goods.
Their hands are in their tills to help out
every project and enterprise to which
their contributions are solicited upon the
score of benefits to the city's welfare;
and yet these substantial men are denied
a right to the ballot, while any German
born or Italian-born tramp picked up
overalls, was carefully dressed when
compared to the artists after they be
gan their work in Madison Square
Garden. Attendants stood by with
pans of plaster as the sculptors Jump
ed about putting the finishing touches
on their tributes to Dewey's great
ness. No man held himself down
to his own figure. They were all work
ing together with one object in view â
the completion of a great whole to do
honor to a great occasion. Wherever
they could be of use they worked. No
spectators were permitted to bother
them, nor even friends to visit them.
How closely they have had to figure
in order to complete the work in time
is shown by. the fact that the last fig
ures will not leave Madison Suoare
Garden finished until the day Dewey
lands in New York City and the day
before the great parade of which the
arch is to be the feature.
Whether or not the enthusiasm
which has carried the plans for the
reception, of Dewey so far with a rush
will last long enough to raise the $750,
--000 necessary to make the arch per
manent is extremely doubtful. "Even
if it is," said, Mr. Ward, "many things
will need to be considered carefully.
First, of course, the design of the
arch has been hurriedly decided upon
and might be . afterward much im
proved. t Second, it is by no means
certain that the location is the best
that could be selected. All these mat
ters must come up for discussion
later."
In view of the trouble New York
found in raising the money for Grant's
tomb and the $100,000 for the Washing
ton : memorial arch, it is by no means
certain that this new and much great
er effort will be token up at ail
about the docks, who has been naturalli
ed, may go up to the polls and vote with
out any questioning as to his fitness or
his prompting?, which are frequently ex
pressed by two round dollars in his
pocket, put there by some heeler whom
he votes to serve. It is nonsense to pre
tend that under proper educational and
other tests the Chinese would not make
citizens in every way acceptable to the
republic. Yes. we would have our labor
ers use the ballot too. An ignorant Can
tonese-talking Chinaman is just as fit
and proper a person to vote as your
densely ignorant negroes and European
whites. All of this sort of vote is bad;
such people are entirely unfitted to exer
cise the franchise; yet you persist in per
mitting them to do so. and if black Igno
rance is good enough voting material for
the republic, why is not yellow ignorance
just as good?
"Yes, these are Federal matters rather
than local questions." assented Mr. Parke,
when I called his attention to this faot.
"The larger sphere of our being Is natur
ally related to the Federal Government,
yet there will be local interests which
engage our attention as well. There have
been times in the past when, if we had
been a voting force, Chinese people would
have received more consideration from
city departments. Very recently the Fire
Department notified Chinatown residents
to remove the wooden bars from their
windows; they did so and put up screens;
then the police came along and prohibited
the use of screens. If it were not that
the Chinese, as aliens, have a standing In
the United States court they might some
times go bare of Justice. We think If the
head of a department realized that there
were a thousand votes hung up on a nail
to be lodged against him at the next elec
tion If he acted unfairly with any one In
Chinatown, there would be more care ex
ercised with the rights and feelings of
Chinese."
Mr. Parke In conclnslon admitted that
his Americanized name was not alto
gether a translation from Chinese. If he
were in China his name would be Len
Parke, the family name being Len. Ha
has adopted the surname Robert out
right and contracted his family name to
his middle initial, using the Chinese- sur
named Parke as a Christian name. He has
a brother who is a seaman on the United
States steamer Albatross who is also a
native son. He declares the native sons
are intensely patriotic; during the war
nearly all of them wore decorations of
American colors, and one of the most
treasured possessions of the parlor are
three shells taken by Dye He, a member
of the tong. from one of the Spanish
craft at Manila shortly after the battle.
Dye being an the Boston and having
taken part in that battle.
Certain of the municipal authorities,
however, do not take kindly to this san
guine project of Mr. Parke's of register
ing all the native born Chinese and "see
ing that they vote." "It opens the door,"
said Registrar J. Steppacher. " to end
less fraud and something will certainly
have to be done about It if Parke at
tempts the onslaught on the registration
books which he is said to contemplate.
Who can tell who is a native born Chi
nese and who is not? There is no dis
tinguishing between the two. Some whom
I know to be native born have never as
sociated with whites and they under
stand little or no English, besides many
of thos*e born in China speak our lan
guage quite plainly. If we could be satis
fied with the statements of the witnesses
upon all occasions all would be well, but
we know that "for tricks that are vain,
the heathen Chinee is peculiar. 1
"I will say, however," continued the
Registrar, "that I do not believe that any
of the Chinese natives who have regis
tered thus far are improperly registered
or that the witnesses have stated any
thing but the truth. Last year we had
only six Chinese on the books. This
year, thus far, and since this movement
began, we have nearly forty, and they are
still coming in. As long as there are no
frauds connected with it we are all right,
and, as I have stated, we know of none
thus far."
Gavin McNab said the theme and the
situation were entirely new, and required
the most careful consideration. He had
no doubt the Chinese vote would be a
homogeneous one â that they would each
vote the sentiments of their leader. He
thought the man who could implicitly
control the polling of a thousand votes
would be the strongest political force in
San Francisco, and would have to be
reckoned with in every move made either
!n city or State politics. The favor of
that man would in 1596 have placed Cali
ifornia in the Democratic ranks and
changed eight votes from McKinley to
Bryan. In the Tilden-Hayes contest this
change would have elected Mr. Tilden.
Mr. McNab did not think that this influ
ence, resident in a single individual, was
at all healthy from the standpoint of the
common weal. The theory upon which
the franchise is granted is that its exer
cise shall express the individual, inde
pendent sentiments of the voter. In the
case, however, of men who cannot speak
the English language and who must have
everything political translated for them
by their confidant and leader, this indi
viduality cannot in the nature of things
be manifest. As to what legislation
might be devised to meet the condition
Mr. McNab was unable to suggest, but
his opinion was that it would have to be
effected through Congress.
Still another view was entertained bjr
a wirepuller who had been doing poll
ial chores through the region just be
yond Chinatown for some years past.
"Them lads," says he. "is full regulars.
You'll see them bloods g<>iri' round here
presently eatin' ginger an' smokin' of the
best China-made cigars wots in the box.
The patriotism in their get-ups don't
weigh half as much as does the question
of profit. Do you 'spose that guy Parke
Is goln' to colonize all them votes for
mere sport? Not much, he ain'tâ he's
smooth. He'll have this bunch of votes
In his fist, an' he'll go to Kelly or Buck
or Crimmins an' say, 'See here wot I've
got!' â¢Wot'll yer take for 'emT Buck'U
ask. 'Wot'll you gimme?' will say Parke.
'Dollar fer each vote.' 'Fer each name
on the ticket?' an' it'll be a go, an' ther
native sons will be in it way up to ther
necks."
Whether any of the above is oojw
rect ixi his hypdthesis or not, certainly
the possession of a thousand votes will
repose a power in their holder sufficient
at least to make him respectable, If he
desires to be so. Those votes would have
been the balance of power in a dozen
offices in San Francisco at the last elec
tion, and It cannot be doubted that In *
city where the counts are as close as In
San Francisco the man who can influence
the casting of such a number of ballots
will have the deciding of fhe fate of many
ABplrantg to political office.

CHAPTER XIX.
The ladies of the Wainwright party had not Complained at all when de
prived of iven such civilized advantages as a shelter and a knife and fork
ap and water, bul Mrs. Wainwright complained bitterly amid the
balf-civilUation of Arta. She could f no excuse for the absence or
several hundred things which she had always regarded as essential to
it - ; .i a. in. to m.ik. both the professor and Marjory woe
ful with an endless dissertation upon the beds in the hotel at Athens.
Of course, she had not regarded them at the time as being quite ex< ep
, beds . . . that was quite true . . . but tin n one really
knew what one was really missing until one really missed it
She would never have thought that she would â 
those Athenian beds as excellent . . â¢. but experience Is a great teacher
makes one reflect upon the people who year in and year out have
no beds at all, poor things. . . . Well, it made one glad if one did have
bed even If it was at the time on the other side .if the world.
... If she ever reached it she did not know what could ever induce her
to leave it again. . . . She would never b< induced
"'lnduced!'" snarled the professor. The word represented to him a
practiced feminine misusage of truth, and at Buch his white warlock al
ways arose. "'lnduced!' Out of four American women I have seen
lately you seem to be the only one who would cay thai you had endured
this thing because you had been 'induced' by others to come over here.
Mrs. Wainwright fixed her husband with a steely eye. She saw oppor
tunity for a shattering retort. "You don't mean. Harrison, to include
Marjory and 1 in the same breath with those two women?"
The" professor saw no danger ahead for himself. He merely answered:
"I had nu thought either way. It did not seem important."
"Well it is Important," snapped Mrs. Wainwright. "Do you know
that you are speaking ln the same breath of Marjory and Nora Black,
the actress." ... ...
"No," Bald the professor. 'Ts that so?" He was astonished, but he
was not aghast at all. "Do you mean to say t+iat is Nora Black, the
comic opera star': "
"That's exactly who she is," said Mrs. Wainwright dramatically. And
I consider thatâ l i â  nsider that Rufus Coleman has done no less thanâ
misled us."
This last declaration wm'd to have no effect upon the professors
pure astonishment, but Marjory looked at her mother BUddenly. However,
she said nu word, exhibiting again that strange ami inscrutable counte
nance which niaskt <i even the tiniest of her maidenly emotions.
Mrs. Wainwright was triumphant, and she immediately set about cele
brating her victory. "Men never see tnose things." she said to her hus
band. "Men ii' â  nose things. You would have gone on f<
without finding <mt that yourâ yourâ hospitality was being abused by that
Rufus Coleman."
The professor woke up. "Hospitality?" he said indignantly. H< --
pltality" 1 have not had any hospitality to be abused. Why don't you
talk sense? it Is noi that, hutâ it might â " He hesitated and then spoke
slowly. "It might be very awkward. Of course, one never knows any
thing definite about Buch people, but'] suppose . . . Anyhow, it was
strange in Coleman to allow her to rr>e<>t us."
"It was all a prearranged plan," answered the triumphant Mrs. Wain
wright. "She came here im purpose to meet Kufus Coleman, and he knew
it. and I should not wonder if they had not the exact spot picked out
where they w< re going to meet."
"I can hardly believe that," said the pfnfossor ln distress. "I can
hardly believe that. It does not seem to me that Colema.n â "
"On, yes. Your dear Uufus coleman." cried Mrs. Wainwright. "You
think he is very tine now. But 1 can remember when you didn't
th'nk "
And the parents turned together nnd abashed looked at their daughter.
The professor actually flushed with shame. U seemed to him that h
Just committed an atrocity upon the heart of his child. The instinct of
each of them was to go v"> her and console her in their arms. She noted
It immediately, and seemed to fear it. She spoke In a clear and even
voice. "! don't think, father, that you should humiliate me by suppos
ing that T am concerned at all If Mr. Coleman cares to get Nora Black
over here."
"Not at all?" stuttered the professor. "I '
Mrs. Wainwright's consternation turned suddenly to anger. "He is a
ecai epoat. A rascal. Aâ a "
"Oh," pnid Marjory coolly, "I don't see why it isn't his own affair. He
didn't really present her to you. mother, you remember? She seemed quite
to force heY way at first, and thf>n youâ you did the rest. It should be
very easy to avoid her. now that we arf out of the wilderness. And then it
becomes a private matter of Mr. Coleman's. For my part. 1 rather liked
her. I don't see such a dreadful calamity."
"Marjory!" exclaimed her mother. "Flow dreadful. Liked her! Don't
let me hear you say such shocking things."
"I fall to see anything shocking, " answered Marjory stolidly.
The professor was looking helplessly fn.m his daughter to his wife, and
from his wife to his daughter, like a man who was convinced that his
troubles would never end. This new catastrophe created a different kind
of difficulty, but he considered that the difficulties were as robust as had
been the preceding ones. He put on his hat and went out of the room
He felt an impossibility of saying anything to Coleman, but he. felt that
he must look upon him. He must look upon this man and try to know
from his manner the measure of guilt. And Incidentally he longed for the
machinery of a finished society which prevents Its parts from clashing,
prevents it with its great series of law upon law, easily operative, but re
lentless. Here ho felt ns a man flung into the jungle with his wife and
daughter, where they could become the victims of any sort of savagery.
His thought referred once more to what he considered the invaluable ser
vices of Coleman, and as he observed them in conjunction with the present
accusation he was simply dazed. It was then possible that one man could
play two such divergent parts. He had not learned this at Washurst
But no; the world was not such a bed of putrefaction. He would not be
lieve If he would not believe it.
Aft^r adventures which require great nervous endurance it is only upon
the second or third night that the common man sleeps hard. The students
had expected to slumber like dogs on the first night after their trials but
none slept long, and few slept soundly.
Coleman was the first man to rise. When he left the room the stu
dents were just beginning to blink. He took his dragoman among the
shops and he bought there all the little odds and ends which might go to
make up the best breakfast in Arta. If he had had news of certain talk
he probably would not have been playing dragoman for eleven people
Instead he would have been buying breakfast for one. During his
absence tho students arose and performed their frugal toilets. Consider
able attention was paid to Coke by the others "He made a monkey of
you," said Peter Tounley with unction. He twisted you until you looked
like a wet gray rag. You had better leave this wise guy alone."
It waa not the night nor was It meditation that had taught Cope any
thing, but he seemed to have learned something from the mere lapse of
time. In appearance he waa eubdued, but he managed to make a tem
porary jauntiness as he naid: "Oh I don t know.
"We'll, you ought to know," said he who was called Blllle. "You ought
to know. You made an egregious snark of yourself Indeed, you some
times resembles a boojum. Anyhow, you were a plain chump. You ex
ploded your face about something of which you knew nothing, and I'm

"You're a half-bred water spaniel," blurted Peter Tounlcy. "And," he
added musingly, "that is a pretty low animal."
Cuke was argumentative. "Why am I?" he asked, turning his head
from side ro side. "I don't sop whore I was so wrong."
"Oh. dances, balloons, picnics, parades and ascensions," they retorted
profanely. "You swam voluntarily into water that was too deep for you.
Swim out. Get dry. Mere's a towel."
Coke, smitten in the face with a wet cloth rolled into a ball, grabbed
it and Hung it futtlely at a well dodging companion. "No," he cried, "I
don"t see it. Now, look here, I don't see why we shouldn't all resent this
Nora Black business."
one student said: "Well, what's the matter with Nora Black, any
how?"
Another student said: "I don't see how you've been issued any license
to say things about Nora Black."
Another student said dubiously: "Well, he knows her well."
And then three or four spoke at once. "He was very badly rattled
wht n she appeared upon the scene. "
Peter Tounley asked: "Well, which of you people know anything wrong
about Nora Black?"
There was a pause, and then C/ite said: "Oh, of courseâ l don't know
but "
He who was called Billie then addressed his companions. "It wouldn't
be right to Bpeak any old lie about Nora Black, and by the same token
It wouldn't be right to s>Â«e old Mother Wainwright chummin' with her.
There is no wisdom hi going further than that. Old Mother Walnwright
don't know that her fair companion of >â¢ sterday la the famous comic opera
star. For my part, I believe that Coleman is simply afraid to tell her. I
don't think he wished to see Nora Black yesterday any more than he
wished to see the devil. The discussion, as I understand itâ concerned
Itself only with what Coleman had to do with the thing, and yesterday
anybody could see that lie was In a panic."
They heard a step on the Ptair, and directly Coleman entered, followed
by his dragoman. They were laden with the raw material for breakfast.
The correspondent looked keenly among the students, f<>r it was plain
that they had been talking of him. It filled him with rage, and for a
stifling moment he could not think why he failed to immediately decamp In
chagrin and leave eleven orphans to whatever fate their general Incompe
tence might lead them. It struck him as a deep Bhame that even then he
and his paid man were carrying in the breakfast. He wanted to fling it
mi the tlnor and walk out. Then he remembered Marjory. She was the
reason. She was the reason for everything.
Bui he could nut repress certain of bis thoughts. "Say, you people." he
said icily, "you had better soon learn to hustle for yourselves. I may be a
dragoman, and a butl< r, and a cook, and a housemaid, but I'm blowed if
J'm a wetnurse." In reality be had taken the most generous pleasure In
working for the others before their eves had even be<T opened from sleep,
but it was now all turned to wormwood. It is certaain that even this
could not have deviated this executive man from labor and management
because th'-se were his lif>-. Hut he felt that he was about to walk out
of the room, consigning them all to Hades. His glance of angry reproach
fastened Itself mainly upon Peter Tounley. because he knew that of all
Peter was the most innocent.
Peter Tounley was abased by this glance. "So you've brought us some
thing to eat, old man. That is tremenodusly nice of you â weâ appreciate
it likeâ ev< rything."
Coleman was mollified by Peter's tone. Peter had had that emotion
which is equivalent to a sense of guilt, although in reality he was speech
less. Two or three of the other students bobbed up to a sense of the
situation. They ran to Coleman, and with polite cries took his provisions
from him. One dropped a bunch of lettuce on the floor, and others re
proached him with scholastic curses. Coke was Beated near the window,
half militant, half conciliatory. It was impossible for him to keep up a
manner of deadly enmity while Coleman was bringing in his breakfast.
He would have much preferred that Coleman had not brought in his break
fast. He would have much preferred to have foregone breakfast alto
gether. He would have much preferred anything. There seemed to be a
conspiracy of circumstance to put him in the wrong and make him appear
as a ridiculous young peasant. He was the victim of a benefaction, and
he hatod Coleman harder now than at any previous time. He saw that if
he stalked out and took his breakfast alone In a cafe, the others would
consider him still more of an outsider. Coleman had expressed himself
like a man of the world and a gentleman, and Coke was convinced that
he was a superior man of the world and a superior gentleman, but
that he simply hnd not had words to express his position at the proper
time. Coleman was glib. Therefore, Coke had been the victim of an
THE SUNDAY CALL.
attitude as well as of a benefaction. And so he deeply hated Coleman.
The others were talking cheerfully. "What the deuce are these, <-Â°l e -
man? Sausages? Oh, my. And look at these burlesque rishes. Say, tnese
Greeks don't care what they eat. Them thar' things am sardines in tne
crude state. No? Great God, look at those things. Look. What? \es,
they are. Radishes. Greek synonym for radishes."
The professor entered. "Oh." he said apologetically, as if he were in
truding in a boudoir. All his serious desire to probe Coleman to the oot
tom ended in embarrassment. Mayhap it was not a law of feeling, but it
happened at any rate. He had come in a puzzled frame of mind, even an
accusative frame of mind, and a'most immediately he found himself suffer
ing like a culprit before his judge. It is a phenomenon of what we call
guilt and innocence.
Coleman welcomed him cordially. "Well, professor, good morning.
I've rounded up some things that at least may be eaten."
"You are very good; very considerate. Mr. Coleman," answered the pro
fessor hastily. "I am sure we are much indebted to you." He had
scanned the correspondent's face, and it had -been so devoid of guile that
he was fearful that his suspicion, a base suspicion, of this^noble soul
would be detected. "No, no; we can never thank you enough."
Some of the students began to caper with a sort of decorous hilarity
before their teacher. "Look at the sausage, professor. Did you ever see
Buch sausage? Isn't It salubrious? And see these other things, sir.
Aren't they curious? I shouldn't wonder if they were alive. Turnips sir.
No, sir. I think they are Pharisees. 1 have seen a Pharisee. look like a
pelican, but I have never seen a Pharisee look like a turnip, so I think
these turnips must be Pharisees, sir. Yes, they may be walrus. We re not
sure. Anyhow, their angle.- are geometrically all wrong. Peter, look
out." Some green stuff was flung across the room. The professor laughed;
Coleman laughed. Despite Coke, dark-browed, sulking, and yet desirous
of reinstating himself, the room had waxed warm with the old college
feeling, the feeling of lads who seemed never to treat anything respect
fully, and yet at the same time managed to treat the real things witn re
spect. The prufessor himself contributed to their wild carouse over tne
strange Greek viands. It was a vivacious moment common to this class
in times of relaxation, and it was understood perfectly.
Oke arose. "I don't fee that I have any friends here, he said
hoarsely, "and in consequence I don't see why I should remain here..
All looked at him. At the same moment Mrs. Wainwnght and Marjor>
entered the room.
CHAPTER XX.
"Good-morning," said Mrs. Wainwright jovially to the students, and
then she stared at Coleman as if he were a sweep at a wedding.
"Good-morning," said Marjory. _ .
Coleman and the students made reply. "Good-morning. Good-morn
ing. Good-morning. Good-morningâ" . Â
It was curious to sea this greeting, this common phrase this bit nfold
ware, this antique, come upon a dramatic scene and pulverize it. Notmns,
remained but a ridiculous dust. Coke, glowering, with his lips still trem
bling from heroic speech, was an angry clown, a pantaloon in rage isotn-
Ing was to be done to keep him from looking like an ass. He strode toward
the door mumbling about a walk before breakfast. â¢ . ,
Mrs. Wainwright beamed upon him. "Why, Mr. Coke, not before
breakfast? You surely won't have time." It was grim punishment He
appeared to go blind, and he fairly staggered out of the door mumbling
again, mumbling thanks or apologies or explanations. About the niouth
of Coleman played a sinister smile. The professor cast upon his
wife a glance expressing -weariness. Tt was as if he said: "There you go
again. You can't keep your foot out of it." She understood the glance,
and so she asked blankly: "Why, what's the matter? Oh." Her belated
mind grasped that It was an aftermath of the quarrel of Coleman and
Coke. . Marjory looked as if she was distressed in the belief that her
mother had been stupid. Coleman was outwardly serene. It was Peter
Tounley who finally laughed a cheery, healthy laugh and they all looked
at him with gratitude as if his sudden mirth had been a real statement
of reconciliation and consequent peace.
The dragoman and others disported themselves until a breakfast was
laid upon the floor. The adventurers squatted upon the floor. They made
a large company. The professor and Coleman discussed the means 6T get
ting to Athens. Peter Tounley. Sat next, to Marjory. "Peter," she said
privately, "what was all this, trouble between Co'leman and (Joke?" '
Peter answered blandly: "Oh. nothing at all. Nothing at all."
"Well, butâ" she persisted, "what was the cause of it?"
He looked at her quaintly. He was not one of those in love with her,
but he was interested in the affair. "Don't you know?" he asked.
She understood from his manner that she had been some kind of an
Issue in the quarrel. "No," she answered hastily. "I don't."
"Oh. I don't mean that," said Peter. "I only meantâ l only meantâ
oh, well, it was nothingâ really."
"It must have been about something," continued Marjory. She contin
ued because Peter had denied that she was concerned in it. "Whose
fault?"
"I really don't know. It was all rather confusing," lied Peter tran
quilly.
Coleman and the professor decided to accept a plan of the correspond

The dVagoman had said, that he had found two large carriages rentable*

"Go ahead," urged Nora. "Tell me about it. Have it out.
He began with great importance and solemnity. "Now, to tell you the
truth * â¢ that is why I hate him â¢ â¢ I hate him like anything. â¢ â¢
I can't see why everybody admires him so. I don't see anything to him

wouldn't trust him with two dollars. Why, I know stories about him that

His speech had become a torrent. But here Nora raised her hand
"Oh! Oh! Oh! That will do. That will do. Don't lose your senses. I
don't see why this girl Marjory is any too good. She is ( no chicken. 111
bet. Don't let yourself get fooled with that sort of thing.
Coleman was unaware of his incautious expressions. He floundered
on, while Nora looked at him as if she wanted to wring his neck. Noâ
she's too fine and too goodâ for him or anybody like himâ she a too flna
and too goodâ" . -; \:. M _ â
"Aw, rats," interrupted Nora, furiously. "You make me tired.
Coke had a wooden-headed conviction that he must make Nora under
stand Marjory's infinite superiority to all others of her sex, and so he
passed into a panegyric, each word of which was a hot coal to the girl ad
dressed. Nothing would stop him, apparently. He even made the most
stupid repetitions. Nora finally stamped her foot formidably. Will you
stop? Will you stop?" she said through her clenched teeth. 'Do you
think I want to listen to your everlasting twaddle about her? Why, she sâ
she's no better than other people, you ignorant little mamma s boy. She 3
no better than other people, you swab!" .
Coke looked at her with the eyes of a fish. He did not understand.
"But she is better than other people," he persisted.
â¢ Nora seemed to decide suddenly that there would be no accomplish
ment in flying desperately against this rock-walled conviction. "Oh,
well,' she said with marvelous good natuie. "perhaps you are right, num
skull. But look here; do you think she cares for him?"
In his heart, his jealous heart, he believed that Marjory loved Cole
man. but he reiterated eternally to himself that it was not true. As for
speaking it to another, that was out of the question. "No," he said, stoutly,
"she doesn't care a snap for him." If he had admitted it, it would have
seemed to him that he was somehow advancing Coieman's chances.
"Oh, she doesn't, eh?" said Nora enigmatically. "She doesn't? He
studied her face with an abrupt, miserable suspicion, but he repeated
doggedly, "No, she doesn't." M , , ,
"Ahem," replied Nora. "Why. she's set her cap for him all right.
She's after him for certain. It's as plain as day. Can't you see that,
stupidity?"
"No." he said hoarsely. , , ,
'/You are a fool," said Nora. "It isn't Coleman that's after her. It is
she that is after Coleman."
Coke was mulish. "No such thing. Coleman's crazy about her. Every
body has known it ever since he was in college. You ask any of the other
Nora was now very serious, almost doleful. She remained still for a
time, casting at Coke little glances of hatred. "I don't see my way clear
to ask any of the other fellows," she said at last, with considerable bit
terness. "I'm not in the habit of conducting such inquiries."
Coke felt now that he disliked her, and he read plainly her dislike of
him. If they were the two villains of the piny, they were not having fun
together at all. Each had some kind of a deep knowledge that their aspi
rations, far from colliding, were of such character that the success of one
would mean at least assistance to the other, but neither could see how to
confess It. Perhaps it was from shame; perhaps it was because Nora
thought Coke to have little wit: perhaps it was because Coke thought
Nora to have little conscience. Their talk was mainly rudderless. From
time to time Nora had an inspiration to come boldly at the point, but this
Inspiration was commonly defeated by some extraordinary manifestation
of Coke's Incapacity. To her mind. then, it seemed like a proposition to
ally herself to a butcher boy in a matter purely sentimental. She won
dered indignantly how she was going to conspire with this lad, who
puffed out his infantile cheeks in order to conceitedly demonstrate that he
did not understand the game at all. She hated Marjory for It. Evidently
It was only the weaklings who fell in love with that girl. Coleman was
an exception, but then Coleman was misled by extraordinary artifices. She
meditated for a moment if she should tell Coke to go home and not bother
her. What at last decided the question was his unhappiness. She clung to
this unhappiness for its value as it stood alone, and because its reason for
existence was related to her own happiness. "You say you are not going
back to Athen with your party. I don't suppose you're going to stay
here. I'm going back to Athens to-day. I came up here to see a battle,
but it doesn't seem that there are to be any more battles. The fighting
will now all be on the other side of the mountains." Apparently she had
learned in some haphazard way that the Greek peninsula was known by a
spine of almost Inaccessible mountains, and the war was thus split Into
two simultaneous campaigns. The Arta campaign was known to be
ended. "If you want to go back to Athens without consorting with your
friends you had better go back with me. I can take you in my carriage as
far as the beginning of the railroad. Don't you worry. You've got money
enough, haven't you? The professor isn't keeping your money?"
"Yes " he said slowly. "I've got money enough."
In their abstracted walk they had arrived in front of the house occu
pied by Coleman and the Wainwright party. Two carriages, forlorn in
dusty age, stood before the door. Men were carrying out new leather lug
gage and Singing it into the traps amid a great deal of talk which seemed
to refer to nothing. Nora and Coke stood looking at the scene without
either thinking of the importance of running away, when out tumbled
"seven students, followed immediately but in more decorous fashion by
the WainwriKhts and Coleman. :- ; .
Some student set up a whoop. "Oh, there he is. There's Coke. Hey,
Coke, where you been? Here he is. profssor."
CHAPTER XXI.
Nora and Coke were an odd looking pair at the time. They stood in
deed as if rooted to the spot, staring vacuously, like two villagers, at the
surprising travelers. It was not an eternity before the practiced girl of
the stage recovered her poise, but to the end of the incident the green
youth looked like a culprit and a fool. Mr?. Wainwright's glower of of
fensive incredulity was a masterpiece. Marjory nodded pleasantly; the
professor nodded. The seven students clambered boisterously into the
forward carriage, making it clang with noise like a rook's nest. They
shouted to Coke: "Come on; all aboard; come on. Coke; we're off. Hey,
:here. Cokey, hurry up." The professor, as soon as he had seated himself
on the forward seat of the second carriage, turned in Coke's general direc
tion and asked formally, "Mr. Coke, are you or arp you not coming with
us?" He felt seemingly much in doubt as to the propriety of abandoning
the headstrong young man. and this doubt was not at all decreased by
Coke' a appearance with Nora Black. As far as he could tell, any asser
tion of authority on his part would end only in a scene in which Coke
would probably insult him with some gross violation of collegiate conduct.
As at first the young man made no reply, the professor, after waiting,
spoke again. "You understand, Mr. Coke, that if you separate yourself
from the party you encounter my strongest disapproval, and if I did not
feel responsible to the college and your father for your safe journey to
New York Iâ l don't know but what I would have you expelled by cable
if that were possible."
Although Coke had been silent and Nora Kind; had had the appear
ance of being silent in reality she had lowered her chin and whispered
sideways and swiftly. She had said: "Now here's your time. Decide
quickly, and don't look such a wooden Indian."
Coke pulled himself together with a visible effort and spoke to the pro
fessor from an Inspiration in which he had no faith. "I understand my
rluties to you. sir. perfectly. 1 also understand my duty to the college.
Bui T fail to see where either of these obligations require me to accept the
introduction of objectionable people Into the party. Tf I owe a duty to the
college and to you. J don't owe any to Coleman, and. as I understand it,
Col.man was not in the original plan of this expedition. If such had been
the case I would not have been here. 1 can't tell what the college may
see fit to do, but as for my father. I have no doubt of how he will view it. ;>
The first one to be electrified by the speech was Coke himself. He saw
with a kind of sub-conscious amazement this volley of bird shot take effect
upon the face of the old professor. The face of Marjory Hushed crimson,
as if her mind had sprung to a fear that if Coke could develop ability in
ibis singular fashion he might succeed In humiliating her father intha
street in the presence of ihe seven students, her mother, Coleman andâ
herself. She had felt the bird shot stirg her father.
When Coke had launched forth. Coleman. with his legs stretched far
apart, had just -struck a match on the wall of the house and was about to
light a cigar. His groom was leading up his horse. He saw the vain.' of
Coke's argument more appreciatively and sooner perhaps than did Coke.
The match dropped from his fingers, and in the white sunshine and stili
air it burned on the pavement orange-colored and with languor Coleman
held his cigar with all five fingersâ in a maaner out of all the HwÂ« '
smoking. He turned toward Coke. Their was danger in the moment but
then in a flash it came upon him that his role was not of squabbling with
Coke, far less of punching him. On the contrary, he wad to (< t the I
of a cool and instructed nian who refused to be waylaid into foolishness I
the outcries of this pouting youngster and who placed himself in comDlete
deference to the wishes of the professor. Before the professor had time
to embark upon any reply to Coke, Coleman was at the side of the car
riage and with a fine assumption of distress was saving- "Professor I
could very easily ride back to Agrinion alone. It would 'be all right.' I
To bis surprise the professor waved at him to be silent as if he were
a mere child. The old man's face was set with the resolution of ex 5

with feeling, but with no trace of anger: "Mr. Coke it has broba

Some very lovely gowns trimmed with
narrow Valenciennes of an inexpensive
quality are not as .expensive as they are
elaborate, and any one who has a knack
for sewing upon rows of ruffles, edging
them with lace, and then putting them
on a skirt, will be successful with those
models. They are usually of the yel
low Valenciennes. Dozens of little ruf
fles, very narrow and edged with this very
narrow lace, are put upon a white nain
sook skirt. The skirt is white, but the ruf
fles and the lace edging them are decid
edly yellow. Then there is a polonaise,
or rather tunic, of white nainsook, which
may have Insertions of the Valenciennes
lace about Its flowing edges, or may not.
If It does not the tunic appears to be a
part of the underskirt â Is, It Is fas
tened to the top of the ruffled skirt, and
the ruffles come out from It like foam.
The tunic meets at the waist and Is
pointed in frontâ that Is, meets in a point,
bo that the yoke and shoulders are cov
ered with these little ruffles, and the
collar is - of lace and nainsook. The ruf
fles usually fall over the tops of the
sleeves, which are made of row upon row
of Insertions of nainsook and lace. ThÂ«
result is a diaphanous dream of a gown.
The time consumed In making It will
never show, and a modiste will have to
charge a good round sum to get adequate
compensation for her work. If iv wearer
makes it she can leave her own valuable
time- out of the bill.

INTERESTING ITEMS ON
HOUSEHOLD MATTERS
Tvnonn who live In top fiats and who
nave to climb what seems to them endless
staircases to reach their homes should
not take the matter to heart, for a well
known physician declares that stair
climbing Is the very best thing for the
health when performed In a proper man
ner.
Usually a person treads on the ball of
bis foot In taking each step. This Is very
tiresome and wearying, as it throws the
entire suspended weight of the body on
the muscles of the legs and feet. In walk-
Ing or climbing stairs the risfht method is
to seek for the most equal distribution
possible of the body's weight.
In walking upstairs the feet should be
placed squarely down on each step, heel
and all, and then the work should be per
formed slowly and deliberately. In this
way there is no strain upon any particu
lar muscle, but each one is doing its duty
In a natural manner.
Climbing stairs in this manner is an ex
cellent form of exercise for the lower
limbs, and, provided the chest is thrown
well back and the climber does not get
Into the habit of bending half double
when ascending stairs, is excellent for the
lungs and heart. The latter is excited to
a more rapid action and the lungs get full
play.
The doctor is in the habit of prescribing
systematic stair-climbing for all his pa
tients who are suffering from dyspepsia
or lung trouble, and says that many a
case of incipient consumption has been
cured by the patient having to climb
â¢tairs.
A clever clothes closet for a woman is

to enter the side, which Is covered either

ELECTRICAL
RANGES '
PROMISE
TO BE THE
FAD FOR
UP-TO-DATE
COOKS.
Electrical ranges now. Electrical
kitchens with every labor-saving devic*
Imaginable. Xo more coal stoves with
ashes, dirt and smell.
No more ugly gas stoves that have to
be closely watched if one dislikes burned
dinners. Just electrical ranges, orna
mental and time-saving.
Expensive? Quite.
These electrical ranges look very much
like the furniture in a living room. The
heating apparatus is made of soapstone
and on this polished shelf the electrical
cooking utensils stand. Each one has Its
own heater, which is somewhat smaller
than the base of the kettles. The cur
rent is at the back of the tile and taps
the plugs. Each plug has a lever which
regulates the degrees of heatâ "hot,"
"medium" and "very hot." No firÂ© to
build and to sit and wait for. Just press
a button and the whole force goes on
without any preparation. The heat can
be applied at any one place, none being
lost as in an ordinary coal range. The
ovens and platÂ© warmers are madÂ« of
block tin trimmed with polished brass.
The ovens have a thermometer and In
the more expensive ranges glass doors.
The surface of an electrical heater
heats very rapidly, in one-half the time
consumed by an ordinary fire and cooks
In the same proportion.
Electrical kitchens are a little more
expensive than ordinary ones, a good one
costing all the way from $120 to $200. The
ovens and plate warmers are most ex
pensive, the oven i coming as high as $70
apiece.
The portable stoves which are to bÂ«
set on the corner of a table, bake hot
cakes a tender and delicious brown.
They are $5, and some of the individuals
$20. Teakettles and coffee pots are $5,
$7 50 to $8. They keep the tea and coffee
hot all through the meal and are the
handiest things imaginable.
The same with the chafing dish, No
more bother with alcohol, that always
spills and never did have an appetizing
odor. The chafing dishes are works of
art and therefore costs money. ' Sixteen to
thirty dollars are their prices.
As for the expense for running an elec
trical range. It differs with the location.
In cities or towns where electricity is
manufactured it is much less expensive
than either coal or gas. :
An ordinary coal range uses from 75
cents to a dollar's worth of coal a day for
a medium-sized family. In the hands of
an inexperienced person an electrical will
for one meal cost $3, while otherwise 15
cents' worth of electricity will run a
range for five hours.
Like everything else practice and ex
perience are needed.
When gauged properly electricity Is no
more expensive than any other fueL The
overt is the most extravagant part. But if
heated to a certain point and half of the
current turned off It will cook just as well
and the rest of the current, if needed, can
be divided among the heaters.
A few stores and companies have finely;
equipped kitchens, where meals are pre
pared for directors and employes.
Electrical ranges make cooking a de
light and save an Immense amount of
time and patience. Electrical inventions
are not limited to the kitchen. There are
electric foot-warmers, electric heating
pads and electric radiators. The heating
pads are made of thick felt and take the
place of the hot-water bag. It is much
more convenient and no time Is lost wait
ing for water to heat.
The foot-warmer is a delight to Invalids,
as it is made of cast Iron and bo con
structed that it can be used anywhere,
under chair or desk. ThÂ« electric radiat
ors screw to the baseboard of thÂ© wall
and the carpet is held firmly by clamped
feet. They soon heat a chilly corner and
can be moved when desired from place to
place. _
{Pointers on Curtains.
"Windows are the eyes to our housea."
Just as our eyes betray our thought bo
the window expresses the character and
taste of the people within. So much Is
expressed. The manner of the people;
refinement and culture; order in tha
household: whether dirty faced children
romp behind its cover. I mean It. I'll
r .i nickel that if you go into a house

in the windows you will findâ taking f< r
granted there are childrenâ a baby with
a dirty frock and a face which soap and
water" would improve. Nine cases out <â >?
ten you will find it soâ and lose your
nickel.
A curtain may be royally experariTe and
yet not look half as nice as a curtain
next door, which cost one-fourth as much.
It isn't in the curtainâ it's In the way it's
hung.
White curtains always suggest dainti
ness; red and pink and blue and green,
look, especially at night when the shades
happen to be up. like great dragon's eyes
with a wicked wink. If you want colored
curtains put them over the white â never
next to the street. Arrange them so they
can be drawn together ana tone down the
glare when the sun strikes the window.
That is all they are meant for.
In buying enrtains choose something
that washes well. Curtains that can't
stand being laundrled are an abomina
tion. In bedrooms particularly curtains
should be changed once a month. Dust
soon accumulates and the laundry is the
only alternative.'
Keep the curtains fresh and dainty,

which a skirt may be hung and pulled out

from the top five or six brass rods run

WHAT TWO CALIFORNIA WOMEN.
T7 T is of more than passing interest thnt the paths and destiny of the
l| two California women who have taken up the work of lifting Califor
nia higher than its materialities, lofty though they be, have met,
crossed and paralleled, during their career.
Leland Stanford wps Governor of the State. G-eorge Hearst as
pired to bo, and in the pursuit and defeat of his ambition was the
provocation for the conditions which deprived Governor Stanford of the
university regency and compelled the completion of his intention in
the founding- of a rival institution. Both men became Senators, sat
together in that great chamber and there renewed a friendship that had
grown cold under the vexations of politics. Senator Hearst was a man
of qualities. No one can read his description of his weary march to the
new gold fields we now call the Comstock without receiving a pro
found impression of his descriptive powers. He trudged over the moun
tains on a doubtful quest. His fortunes were at the lowest ebb, and
when, in his own language, worn out, he sat down by the trail, "turned
weak and human," and debated a retreat, to rise strengthened by the
determination to finish the march and make one more throw for fortune,
made it and won, there is presented a picture worthy to stand with the
career of Robert Bruce.
Like Stanford's his life came to a close while he was yet a Senator
of the United States.
When his largo estate came within control there began to develop
ono of those compensations, those restorations, so rare in the history of
a Stale. As influences emanating from his newspaper had influenced the
less to the State University of Stanford's fortune, his wife taking on
a high purpose and deciding that her property should go for the good of
mankind and the ennobling of her State, developed a way to devote it to
higher education. As her friendly rival in a similar purpose, she was
the mother of one child, happier in his survival. There was nothing
in the way but to find the way to do the most good with her riches. That
way she found herself.
Mrs. Hearst is not lacking in high ideals, nor does she lack in
applying them practically. She found the State University meanly
housed. Its ignoble architectural equipment wrb brought into more re
pulsive relief by the wÂ«ll designed beauties and fitness of the structures
cf Stanford University.
Possessing excellent taste, refreshed by personal knowledge of tlie
best European models, she determined that T.li 3 architecture of the State
University should be expressive of its intellectual purpose, and that the
part of education which is absorbed from daily contact with the best
and most beautiful in art should bs no longer denied to the sons and
daughters of the State who get their training nt Berkeley.
Her bold plans involved the razing of every building on the State
campus, and the effective grouping of the best structures known to the
resources of architecture. From the application of landscape engineer
ing to the fine grounds, heretofore untouched by any artistic hand, to
the finial of the last necessary structure, she built the great plan in
her mind and then called into action the architects of the world to work
out its details.
When the great work is finished the highest interests of the State
will be enthroned upon the purpose formed and executed by a woman.
The rugged men of California have done much for the State. They have
scaled frowning summits to carry commerce over mountain heights and
have gone into the depths to drag out gold to build ships and cities.
Forests have fallen before them and strange waters and far shores
have yielded their treasures of commerce to the profit of adventure. But,
after all, it may be well questioned whether all the men together have
wrought as much for the everlasting interests th.it are greater than
gold, more immortal than commerce, as have these two women.
When their work is done and the two universities are in full action,
panoplied in the glorias their ganius has created, the names of Mrs.
Hearst and Mrs. Stanford will ba cherished in every happy house
within our borders, and no matter what monuments may attempt to
perpetuate their memory, those built by themselves will the longest en
dure and be the inspiration of the remotest generations.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
IT Is worth noting what a front rank
woman has hold in the education of
California. Fifty years ago Mrs.
Olive Mann Isbell stood a row of
empty boxes in a room by the old Santa
Clara Mission, and rang- her clanking
bell to call together the first American
school In our State. The pupils who were
forthcoming; sat on the empty box.- and
bumped little bare heels against the
front of them. There was a hole in the
ceiling where the smoke had leave to
escape, and where it availed itself or not
of Its permission as it and the weather
chose.
But in spite of what some might have
thought inconveniences, Mrs. Isbell from
lowa went at her work as if she didn't
mir.d, which Is the best way in the world
to embarrass inconveniences. Without
adjustable desks or spring-roller maps or
much be-patente,d felt erasers, she never
theless taught. She stands in the records
to-day as the founder and teacher of the
first American school of California.
It is not with so different a spirit, after
all. although with such widely different
means, that Mrs. Hearst and Mrs. Stan
ford are continuing the work which .Mrs.
Jsbell began. Both of them have had
much to struggle with as did she. Both
have had one purpose and have held to
it. That purpose has been the higher
civilization of California.
Mrs. Hearst's work has been just as
much her own conception us was Mrs.
IsbeN's in the old days. The State was
to her mind not offering all the advan
tages Jn an educational way thru its
young people deserved. Hence she would
take the matter in hand.
It has held good straight through
her life that when Mrs. Hearst saw any
thing which needed attending to, she
promptly attended. She has wanted
things well done and has known that she
must therefore do them herself Since
her husband's death she has little by
little grown into the recognition of tnÂ«
public as a philanthropist. Philanthropy
has become a profession these days but
there are all sorts and conditions of its
professors. She is of thr kind that is not
satisfied with the mere giving of money
but must needs give of personality alone
with it. '* 6
In the East, Washington has profited by
more of her charities ihan any other
Â£ its ;; He I l lnt Â«'Â£ P!1 t in S'rls is without
limit, and it shows Itself in the endow
ments she has chosen to make. There is
an Episcopal school for girls that is
thriving under her care. There is a
women's club .hat looks to herâ never In
vainâ for a helping hand. There are as
many as three kindergartens which she
supports, and the chief one of these Is
a training school where struggling young
teachers may be helped to help them
selves. ./..;. â â â "â V.-
Neither has' she neglected the Washing
ton boys. There is a boys' home there
conducted by the Episcopal church which
she has furnished with her own good
faste.
But dearer to Mrs. Hearst's heart than
all of these good deeds are her charities
in the West. She is a Missouri woman by
birth and Senator Hearst was a Mis
sourian. He set out in Western moun
tains to make hi.- fortune. This had been
his ambition ever since a boy.
It was in the West that he chose to
sock his golden land. It was in the West
that he labored and hoped and despaired
and finally found.
The mining country was therefore sa
cred to him as the scene of his mightiest
struggles. It has remained sacred to his
widow for the memory he left.
The mining towns know her bounty. Her
plan of benevolence has for its keynote
â¢"education." In so many lines she has
shown this. Whether it he the teaching
of a score of homeless youngsters or the
endowment of a world-famous university
her aim is ever education. In the dingy
little Montana and Dakota towns that
perch on the sides of brown mountains
she has built libraries that bring a
breath of the great world beyond. Many
of the dreary ones who seek and never
find, or dig good gold for others' profitâ
many of these find a friendly feeling in
the cozy library rooms, where a careful
attendant looks out for everybody's
wants. "In Lead City," a letter says
"the library proved a menace to. bar
rooms." It took some of the men's time.
They wandered to the reading room and
the writing room, and they began to write
cautiously spelled letters to Mrs Hearst
saying "Thank you." She was gratified
by the letters, and seeing that her work
was appreciated she added to what she
had already done. She arranged to have
a musicale given every week by musi
cians whom she hired for the purpose
The men and the women both enjoyed
them. They broke the monotony. It was
a little more like living
In Anaconda^ Mont.?ihe has lately built
a library -.-.vrh as a large city might he
proud of. Miss Andrews says." it is colo
nial in style, broad and strong and wel
coming. Jt is modern throughout In its
appointments. Anaconda is a little place
that is seen now and then only because
Bjfto n ?f r ,{ s U !Ib C r ar| Ut lt can : bra e to even
Uutte of Its library.
And so It goes that from coast to coast
Mrs. Phebe Hearst's hand and mind have
been ready to recognize the need and till
It Schools and libraries and clubs every
where owe her debts of gratitude. But
through air the years that she wa.s work-
Ing ana planning and helping: here and
there she was discussing with herself the
great question how best to use the bulk
of her rare fortune to further the highest
interests? It came at last â answer.
California's sons and daughters are the
fortunate ones.
From the beginning Mrs. Hearst has
aimed at having t*ie University of Cali
fornia the most splendid in the world. She
showed daring thought when she first or
ganized the competition. Admitting that
few would have ever conceived such a
planâ how many of those few would ever
have held to it? It sounded like a story
book. And now to give realism to the
Story, we have the report that several
millions from this California woman are
to start the great project on its road to
completion.
It is in memory of her husband's toils
and defeats and final sue" - s that she
has chosen to give her first attention to a
building for the young mining engineers
who will come to equip themselves at
Berkeley for the same kind of work. If
they are better equipped than George
Hearst was, they may thank his wife for
the fact.
Mrs. Hearst hns loner admired the nat
ural beauties of the Berkeley grounds,
where the buildings now stand, and her
wish was to hay.- this beauty n it hidden,
but developed, perfected. This end was
attained by B'-nard when he saved every
tn c where It had been put in the flrs't
place, and pr< served th< : land
marks for tradition of future freshmen
who will talk vaguely of the old build
ings that once \.
As the time advanced toward the final
decision, Mrs. Hearst cam< â  be on
the scene. Four architects came to make
the awards, and with them brother archi
tects and wives and friends. There have
been entertainments and the excitemi nt
has wearied Mrs. Hearst more than her
friends like to see. She has made her es
cape to the country, now that all Is over,
and nst promises to make her like her
own strong, accomplishing self once more.
This same strong self is ueceiving, by
the way. It is the big soul of a little
womrn. who looks too slenderly nervous
to stand great strains. Her strength is
of a wiry kind that builds on the will
rather than the body. She has a serene
expression and manner that give no indi
cation of the high-strung qualities. Fur
thermore, her femininity is so pror.
In dress and speech that one would never
guess that the firmly executive brain
within would do credit to a man of busi
ness. Mrs. Hearst manages her own prop
erty almost entirely. She has the clear
est insight into business transactions and
is never timid, although always prudent.
That little touch of swetness and
warmth that lurks in her smile and hi r
voice is the heritage of her Southern
parents. Both of them wer-^ Virginians,
and Virginians of the old school. Her
own early life was Bpent in Missouri,
whpre much of the Southern spirit ling
ered a few years ago, and her life in
Washington has fosterei this element in
her nature. Southerners do not break
away easily from old customs.
I thought of this to-day as a very
brown face above a . very spandv whita
apron met me at the door of Mrs. Hearst's
apartments, and the tone, at once rever
ential and protective, in which Mrs.
Hearst's Illness was mentioned had the
true darky ring of loyalty. The mistress
of this maid clings to the service of her
youthâ the negro service, with its affec
tion and its jealousy and its hero-wor
ship still intact.
Although her work has brought her
much before the public of late years, she
Ins an instinctive shrinking from tur
moil. This led her to take refuge in her
country home last week after the excite
ment of banqueting was over and before
the final decision was to be reached.
Across the bay. at the lovely Hacienda
del Poso do Verona, she ent< rtained the
visitors right royally, giving them a
glimpse into the arcadian life <>f country
California. Then the architects came
back to their labor and left their hostess
in quiet. She did not return to town until
the great Thursday. She fled from the
crowd of the hotel where she has apart
ments and went to her own retired rooms
in a high sunny corner of her Mark, t
str>et building. There sho has been
hedged about by an army of still-footed
caretakers. It is a cosy retreat up there
with the sunny windows and the Sowers
and the hide-and-seek screens that zig
zag across velvety carpets.
Mrs. Hearst's keen artistic sense is evi
denced in her dress and her homes She
reverences beauty as one of the elements
*>f goodness. Her Eastern homo is full
of rich hflngings and pictures and curios
which she has loaned many a time for
exhibitions whore women who see little
of the beautiful might learn and enjoy.
Her own education has been extensive
She is a fine linguist, especially known as
a French scholar. Her breadth of learn
ing gives her a breadth of opinion that
only men usually achieve. Her gifts have
boon made to institutions of more than
one religious denomination. Her ',>ositi"ii
as an educator has boon recognized in a
way that no other woman's has ever been
in her holding a State Regency.
1 met a girl I know the other dayâ a
girl who has boon fighting a haul way up
hill for a little sister as well as herself
She lias always longed for s university
education and. the little she had managed
to save imm broad winnings bought her
one year of the coveted college life. Then
the money gave out and she was thrown
lack to light again. When 1 met hÂ»r the
other day there was a kind of s:;renes"s 'a
the grip of her hand and she beamed.
"You are still at work?" I asked.
'â¢I'm a 'Varsity girl, bow." she said
radiantly. "I'm at Berkeley to finish my
course. Yon see, it just happened that
when ?was Btaying over there 1 me; Mrs
Hearstâ and Bomehow- well, Mrs Hearst
is putting me through college. And rriv
little sister is living with me. And we

if Mrs. Hearst could have been there

That is only one little scrap of a story.

STANFORD students of the old ia.ys
rem^rr. ber great, whole-souled re
ceptions siven them in the big
house over at Menlo. They remem
ber moonlight drives through the
long vineyard, where the grapes hung
heavyi awaiting their time. Their cwn
rollicking voices and the thumping of the
clumsy 'bus crashed through the stillness.
Then the lights streamed out of a sudden
from open doors and led the war to two
good weleorr.es from two warm hearts.
One of these hearts stopped beating a
while back. There's another place tilled
Inside the white peace of the litt'.e mau
soleum. There's another reason for
thoughts that sweep away the lauch from
an idler's lips a? he strolls past its steps.
Students of late days know only what is.
It stands wirh the traditions for eraduate
telHng how the sweet, saddened woman
who now walks alone opened her house
to every boy who laid claim to being a
Stanfordite. and. side by side with her
husband, gave them such a royal wel
come as made every mother's son of them
know lie was wanted- There was the
whole raft of them, from Encina Hall
and the frat. houses and the ramshackle
cottages where some bach, it: and every
man was dressed according to his lights.
Judging from results, the lights varied
all the way from tallow candles to incan
descent drops, but did Mrs. Stanford care?
They are her boys to her, every last one
of them, and the woman who has enter
tained newsboys as if they wore titles is
not the one to criticize the cut of
a coat or the tie of a scarf. Some
of them knew hew to do it as It
should be done and some blundered pit
eously. Bet it was all right, once that
hand clasped theirs and the serenity of
these eyes met their eyes. There is some
thing about Mrs. Stanford's eyes that
smooths difficulties.
These good times came in the fall of '92.
A few months later a trouble came to the
tig house, and it was all dark and so dif
ferent. Mrs. Stanford changed to a lonely
woman, who has had almost no care save
to carry out the purpose of herself and
her husband, which at his death became
doubly hers. Nevertheless, in spite of the
soberness that crept in she has .way
kept up a lively Interest in the young peo
ple's doings just as in the old and happier
days. Their pleasure still ia young and
sunny, even if her skies have grown
cloudy. She ia too generous a woman to
Inflict her gri^f upon others. She takes
part in their joys even if her own have
failed.
Mrs. Stanford's Interest in the univer
sity has always been of the most per
soncl <:ha:ucter. It is not enough for her
to direct affairs at a distance and
through ether hand?. Her practical idea
of management was displayed in the very
first yearâ the year when the pioneer
class came in ail Its unadulterated glory
and Golden Age was no name for the
time. Then Mrs. Stanford was so anxious
for i'otai!s to be perfect thnt she .shared
many a meal herself with the R.ibie girls
In their biir. rattling dining room. She
ate of thicir muffins to try if they were
as they should be, and she committed to

she recruits her ranks of friends. In
Washington she was famous during the
Senator's years of office as one of the
most talented hostesses that the Senate
could claim. She seems to have been
born with a gift for entertaining. It is
a gift that has its origin in an entire
absence of self-rdpsciousness and an en
tire consciousness of the needs of other?.
It is the simp!- and old-fashioned virtue
of iovinc one s fellow-man. It is freedom
from posing.
When she gave her regular Christmas
dinners to Washington newsboys, she
was the same hostess that she was to
Cabinet members. Her guests were the
center of Interest, not herself. The boys
ate and ate again, firstly to stop being
hungry and secondly to enjoy being fed.
They "were conducted from turkey to
mince pie with as careful detail as if It
really mattered after all. They ate and
were merry, and said the best things of
her that their vocabulary afforded â and
they thought still better ones.
The Washington life is over now. The
capital has lost one of its best. From
now on her me will be spent in the big
place at California and Powellâ the great
drab house that stands "the top of the
=teps that stand at the top of the hill.
Here the doors are closed just now, and
I stumbled against a bamboo rod that

who lives by herself down where the foot

This little old woman had a husband once
who worked for "the Guvner," and then
the- husband died one day. But somehow
the little old woman went on living in the
same house, although she had no money
to pay rent. s?r.d somehow fuel kept on
coming to her door, although ?he had no
man any longer employed on the estate,
and her chickens remain hers and
seem likely to. so long as she lives.
Mrs. Stanford's charities also spread out
to adjacent towns. Maytield. a mile or so
beyond the campus, rejoiced for several
'years in a wee bit of a kindergarten
within a wee bit of a house, where two
teachers took care of the most juvenile
part of Mayneld society, while Mayfield
mothers washed and scrubbed and bar
gained. The whole school was establish
ed and supported by Mrs. Stanford 3
bounty. They were great days when the
benefactress arrived at the kindergarten
door and descended from her carriage to
spend a forenoon with colored balls and
sand pictures and pinafored happiness. A
proud mother sent Robbie to the school,
and she tells me of one of these visits
when "Mr?. Stanford laid her hand on
Robbie's head and patted it! It was like
it used to be. in England when great la
dies came from the great houses to see
their tenants."

Mrs. Stanford has traveled widely and
studied what there was to learn where
Â«he traveled. She has brought from
Europe collections that adorn her homes.
But thÂ«> best of these have been turned
over to the university museum, where
they are within the reach of all. So as
much as can be of her travels are brought
back to the stay-at-homes whom she
cares for.
It is in the home at Menlo Park that
she likes beat to be. She loves the quiet
restfulness of the house back behind the
trees and the pink geraniums. There are
more lawns and flowers there than on ail
Nob Hill put together, and she likes them.
There is a friendly green parrot hanging
.hi the porch that rasps the air cheer
fully and there is a team of bounding,
booming Great Dane dogs to come to meet

be only a month or two now before th^
students will sec the dignified, black-robed

THE SI'SDAY CALL.
<=p=HE rise of Stanford University -was no more remarkable than has
j been the permanency with which it has been sustained. Its
origin was in a play of politics. Governor Stanford and his
wife were beginning to consider the devotion of a large share of their
fortune to the good of mankind. With that keen insight into the ele
m3nts of success which was an attribute of both, they decided that the
road to achievement lies through the school room, and who would aid
man best must equip him by education to help himself. Governor Per
kins, aware of this growing intention, appointed Governor Stanford aEo
gent of the State University. It was an appointment in rscsss of the
Legislature and had to be confirmed by the Senats. When that body
met the Stats had changed Governors; Stcneman had succeeded Perkins,
and there was a swiftly rising tide of enmity to the Southern Pacific
Railroad. This was generated almost entirely by the Examiner, the
property of Mr. George Hearst. It so influenced tr vernor Stoneman that
immediately upon his inauguration he withdrew PeTkins" nomination of
Governor Stanford to the Regency and sent in another name. This ac
tion for a time suspended the educational intentions of Gcvernor Stan
ford, as far as the public knew. But this suspension was more apparent
than real. Governor Stanford was not a man to put millions into a pro
ject for the public benefit without having a voice in the method of its
application to its intended purpose. His character was a charming
blend of the ideal and practical. His ideals were high and refined. Eut,
when he came to apply them to the concrete concerns of life, each must
be weighed in the practical scale and be rejected or accepted according
to that test. There came to him and his wife the gTeat trial which no
conditions of fortune or station can avoid or mitigate, in the death of
their only son. He wag in the flower and promise of his youth, beauti
ful in person and mentally endowed to a degree that was promising^of
a hieh career. When the end came, and every hope invested in his fu
ture^had faded, there came to his bereaved parents the determination
that his life, ended so untimely, should be resurrected in the lives of
thousands to be. they gathered their great properties and their vast^ re
sources and massed them in the rich endowment of L-eland Stanford
Junior University. It was a conception that must inspire the most
stolid mind and thrill the coldest heart. It was immediately carried
into execution. The noble buildings rose from the ground and after the
work began it proceeded without let or pause until the faculty was in
stalled and the scholastic duties begun.
As was to have been expected in the execution on so great a seal*
of this noble purpose, the matriculations were counted in hundreds. Tha
first year put this young school in the ranks of the oldest and in ail
higher education it was at once counted as a force that had to be
reckoned with.
"With that keen judgment which went into all that he did. Gover
nor Stanford chose for its head Jordan, the pupil of Agassiz. the peer
of Andrew D. White, and the spirit he brought passed to an able fac
ulty. Living to see his hopes realized and the memorial to his son as
sured of immortality. Governor Stanford reached the end of his days and
went cwaj. Not given to aspsrities. in many traits a philosopher, the
frictions cf a great and greatly busy life were forgotten in that day of
sorrow, when the State cams to mourn by his tomb.
The somber time was immediately illuminated by the high cour
age, intelligence and zeal with which the work that had absorbed the
energies cf both was taken and carried by Mrs. Stanford. Hard days
came. The settlement of the vast estate, the adjustment of undefined
interests of the Federal Government, troubles and complications for
which no foresight could provide, came trooping to the assault upon her
strength and courage. But this mother and widow, doubly stricken,
held steadily to the purpose new mere fondly cherished. The limit and
boundary of her personal sacrifices are not public knowledge, but their
magnitude, from which a man would have recoilad, may be judged in the
result. The great school went on, consecrated again in the martyrdom,
of self which its sustenance demanded. A woman once commanded an
army and delivered her country from alien domiaation. "Women have
ruled kingdoms and empires, but above them in history must stand this
woman, the trustee of such a sublime trust, and the founder of king
dom upon kingdorh in that ineffable domain of the intellect whence
issue the principles that govern svevy republic, principality end power.
When every problem had been solved and every trouble sur
mounted, the busy waiting stage of the university passed into the busy
working stage of further development, and the young school further
intrenched its footing and enlarged its influence until its example beat
with an awakening light upon the moss-grown walls of its elders in
the new world and the old. Mrs. Stanford had completed the high
and self-appointed task and had taken her place among the immortals
who chose to live among the few to whom it has been, given to ea
iigLten the world.

Angeles they would find there in Moor
park an ursine problem which would prob
ably puzzle them to study out.
In th* eyes and on the records of the
Park Commissioners of that charming
city the creature referred to is a grizzly
bear cub, a healthy and interesting young-
Bter, which has seen not more than six
short months of existence, and of which
much is to be expected in the future. In

In This Cavern Saltpeter Was Dug to
Supply the Patriots During the
Revolutionary War.
PROBABLY the most curious meet
ing place in the world is the lodge
room of (Jap Creek Lodge No. 72,
Independent Order of Odd Fellows.
The lodge for five years has been meet
ing in Hyder's Cave, near Gap Run,
Term. The cave, in Carter County, five
miles from Elizabethtown and seven
miles from Johnson City, was discov
ered by tho first settlers of Tennessee.
Earth taken from the cave has long
been used for the manufacture of salt
peter. During the Civil War the cave
was worked by the Confederate Gov
ernment, and thousands of pounds of
saltpeter were made there. Some of the
powder used in the battle of Kings
Mountain was manufactured from salt
peter dug in this cave.
The cave lies due east and west, and
at any time during the day there is
erstwhile monarch of California's moun
tains and plains and valleys this particu
lar individual of the species Ursus horri
bilis is a freak such as has never before
been met with.
The Park Commissioners value him
highly, for he fills a long-felt want in
their hearts and lives. For a long time it
has been known among the hunters,
miners and vauueros of the Tehachapis
that these gentlemen were very desirous
of obtaining a grizzly as a special attrac
tion for their park, but as these animals
are very rare now no one was able to sup
ply the demand.
The rapture and purchase of bo young
and healthy a cub was therefore an
event interesting to all Southern Califor
nia and especially satisfactory to the pub
light enough to read. The anteroom of
the lodgeroom is twelve feet square,
arched over by variegated limestone.
It is separated from the main hall by
folding doors.
The hall proper is twelve feet lower
than the anteroom. The main floor is
20x36 feet. At one end is a rostrum 12
feet square, elevated thirty Inches
above the floor. The roof is an arch,
the top of which is twenty feet from
the door. During the summer season
the sun shines in the face of the noble
grand from 3 o'clock until evening.
Since the lodge, which has flfty-flve
members, began meeting in the oave
it has had no deaths. Frequently pic

deavor to propitiate him by offerings of
dainties which are supposed to be particu
larly suited both to the taste and stomach
of an infantile grizzly. Queerly enough,
though, captivity or something else seems
to have developed In this little creature
qualities and proclivities very different
from those characteristic of his species.
Young as he apparently Is he has decided
and indeed depraved ideas on the subject
of diet. The nuts' and fruits and crisp
green things which are dear to the heart
of the grizzly in his native wilds and in
captivity eagerly welcomed by him are
looked upon by this youngster with surly
scorn. The tender, fresh red meat which
is generously provided for his delectation
is left untasted if he can but unearth
somewhere about his abiding place a piece
of decayed flesh, the odor of which would
drive any grizzly worthy of the name
fasting over the mountains into the next
county.
He looks like a young grizzly most cer
tainly as far as the color of his shaggy
coat is concerned, but in no other respect
does he resemble the powerful, ferocious
but always self-r- specting animals who
are supposed to be his forefathers, or
rather his forebears.
A grizzly is cleanly in his habits, dain
tily nice regarding his diet, loftily digni
fied in his deportment, and gifted with a
high grade of animal intelligence. The
Moorpark scion of this aristocratic race
is a vulgar, stupid, filthy little beast, pre
cocious in nothing save the number, size
and general appearance of his dental ar
rangements, which even the commission
ers are unwillingly obliged to admit are
surprisingly aged-looking considering the
few months which ara supposed to have
passed over his baby head. Of a truth he
Is an anomaly, and as such would be
worthy of study were it not that there is
attached to him, grizzly though he is sup
posed to be, a tale of quite another kind
of a bear.
Shortly before this year's glorious
Fourth Dave O'Brien, a vaquero on the
Tejon Ranchos, captured a common black
bear, one of the despised species known
as the "buzzards" of the bear family â
worthless, cowardly, ill-smelling scaven
gers of the brute creation â and not know
ing what else to do with him, made ar
rangements with a Bakersfleld man who
owned a huge and ugly-tempered mastiff
for a finish fight between dog and bear on
the day of our national celebration.
After going to considerable expense in
the way of advertising the match, and
bringing the bear to Bakersfield, the pro
moters of the affair and the big crowd
which had assembled to witness it, met
keenest disappointment at the hands of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, which put an emphatic veto
on the whole enterprise.
To drown his disappointment Dave, in
company with his three financial backers
(two of them miners and the other a va
quero, like himself) started to make an
experimental tour of Bakersfleld's saloons,
and that brought them almost immediate
ly into the company of a barber named
Duggans, who had arrived at that satis
fying stage of inebriation wherein his own
professional prowess seemed to him of all
things in the world most worthy of loud
voiced and continuous praise. One of hia
specialties, it seemed, and the one on
which he most prided himself, was his
ability to turn the darkest kind of a bru
nette into a blonde with a neatness and
dispatch unequaled among his fellows.
He could "bleach the bristles of a shoe
brush any shade of red or yellow," hÂ©
I declared, and as he heard this O'Brien
had an inspiration upon which he im-
[ mediately acted. After consulting with
his "backers," the four proceeded to treat
the barber to all the whisky that ha
could bear up under, meanwhile encourag
ing him to brag his biggest and loudest,
until at last he was so flushed with pro
fessional pride, combined with alcohol,
that he was ready to undertake anything
to prove his vast superiority to all others
of his trade.
When he had arrived at this satis
factory condition Dave and his friends
guided him to the barn wherein the bear
was chained and Dave, affecting not to
believe his previous boasts, bet him JlO
that he neither could nor would bleach
the coat of the creature, as he very prob
ably did not really understand his busi
ness, but was also too cowardly to under
take such a job.
This was too much for Duggan. Ha
wavered but for a moment and then being
assured that the animal was securely
fastened accepted the wager and went to
work. All the bleaching fluid he had in
his shop and pretty nearly all that could
be found in the town drug stores was
speedily secured and poured into a five
gallon palvanized imn pail, and armed
with a long-handled whitewash brush the
barber proceeded to prove his previous as
sertions.
To attain anything even approaching to
success in the undertaking several appli
cations of the linuid were necessary and
considerable hard rubbing, to which the
bear violently objected.
As Duggan was neither clear as to his
brain nor steady as to his legs and tha
bear v.as active, vigorous and vicious it
required the united vigilance of the four
spectatorsâ who were almost exhausted
with laughter before the ludicrous per
formance was over withâ to prevent a
"mix up" between the two, which, in the
bear's exasperated state of mind,
might have resulted unpleasantly
for his tonsorial artist. It seemed
at first as if it would be necessary
to put the bear to soak in the bleaching
preparation in order to produce any ef
fect whatever upon his thick and greasy
fur, but after several wettings and dry
ings the black turned to darkest seal and
then slowly but surely to a reddish-brown
which delighted the four conspirators be
yond measure. True it wasn't the exact
color which would have been necessary
for their purpose had their victim been
larger, but as his size made it necessary
for him to masquerade as a very young
member of the Ursua family the "shade
was eminently satisfactory.
The barber was paid his $10 at once and
the next day O'lJricn sent a tel
egram and received an answer.
A few days later the Park Com
missioners of Los Angeles welcomed
a "little stranger" who traveled to them
in a stout iron-bound crate upon which
was a label stating that the occupant
thereof was a "cub grizzly." From the
size of the check which Dave O'Brien and
his three friends divided up among them
selves a short time afterward it might be
judged that the "cub" fell into appreci-
One thing 'is certain: If the Park Com
missioners have been deceived as to the

raging torrent roars and thundersâ this is
a situation to appal the bravest heart.
And yet there is one woman In California
whom it did not frighten and who telis
the story so quietly that It is apparent
6he wishes to minimize rather than to
exaggerate the danger.
This woman, however, is a Dianaâ born
In the forest, trained from her earliest
years to ride and to shoot, perfectly at
home on the mountain trails, whether by
flay or by night, and an utter stranger to
Buch a thing as fear. What to others
would be a perilous adventure, to be re
membered for a lifetime, is to her only
an incident in a series of experiences so
often repeated that the most startling ac
cident does not appear very ususual.
To mention the name of this young
woman is to revive recollections of 'hat
pioneer and historian of the Yosemite
Valley. J. M. Hutching*, .Mill living and
as much interested as ever in California's
great gallery of natural wonders, which
he ha - devoted his life to making better
known to the worid. It will also recall
to' the minds of many visitors to the vul
ley .ring the last few years the pleasant
picture of a Blender, graceful girl- a per
fect brunetteâ riding a magniticent bUck
horse, a handsome bat vicious tempered
anjir:al whom none but the most accora
plishfl horseman or horsewoman cjuld
think of mounting. This young woman Is
Miss Gertrude Hutchings, daughter of
lings, the explorer and all but <lis
coverer of the beautiful valley with which
his name has been so prominently asso
ciated for more than forty years.
Born in the valley. Miss Hutchings has
known no oth<jr home. and with every

around, he is familar. Her father's cot

African.
Verily, Africa is fast becoming civilized.
An English girl has actually fallen in love
with a dusky African. And no ordinary
irirl is she but one with an abundance of
money and no small share of good looks.
Her name is Florence K. Jewell, and she
is the daughter of Joseph Jewell, a min
ing engineer, who made a fortune in Hex
? Miss Jewell happened to be at Bloem-
Miss Jewell happened to be at Blnem
fontein. the capital of the Orange Free
State some time ago. and there one
eultrv afternoon her attention was at
tracted toward a you- ; Matabele warrior.
He was clad in his picturesque, *' /ee'd
edly barbaric, native costume, and the
ordinary traveler would have seen in him
nothing more than a stalwart African
ravage Miss Jewell, however, saw a
good deal more in hlm-so much more, in
fact, that fhe lost no time In finding out
who he was.
She was informed that he was a pure
blooded Matabele- that he was known a
"Prince" Loben. or Lobengula. and that
he professed to be a relative of the fa
mous Matabeie king of that name. She

being concentrated on Lobengula.
Day after day she went to see and ad
the highest cataract of the world are
never out of one's sight or hearing. Op
posite the door of the pioneer's homo
rose the mighty masses of the Half Dome
and Sentinel Peak, while in the fore
ground thrre glanced by the waters of
that most beautiful of rivers, the clear
flowing, r-haed Merced. In winter
the snows softened the harsh outlines of
the crags and lay deep upon the valley,
and in summer the pine and cedar forests
stretched away in solemn loneliness for
scores of miles.
A childhood spent amid such scenes was
bound to develop a character as unusual
as the surroundings. Love of adventure
was as natural to Miss Hutching.* and
contempt of danger as easy as habits of
domestic and feminine timidity are to
other women. She learned to ride the
most dangerous trails with equal facility
by night and by day, and in the moonlight
nights, when all the valley lay buried
deep in mow, she would tie on her snow
shoes and start out for a long stroll
through the white silences of the tremen
dous mountain gorge. She would pass un
der the shadows of the great cliffs, thread
the ghcstly aisles of the forest, and not
return home till the early hours just be
fore the break of day. As a rifle-shot the
young girl became as proficient as the
most expert hunter, and as for fishing
she could throw a line with the best an
gler and lure the shy trout from their re
cesses with as much certainty as an Indian.
Marvelous are' the tales told of the dar
ing of this quiet, reserved young laiiy,
whose manner is that of the gently reared
daughter of the city rather than of the
border heroine. Sometimes she would
fir.d a basking rattlesnake asleep upon the
trail, and slipping up on it with stealthy
tread she would seize It by the tall, swing
it. swiftly around and around in the air,
and striking its bead against a rock or a
tree kill it before it could seize an oppor
tunity to use its terrible fangs, of which
a single touch meant death. At other
times she would climb the steep trail to
Glacier Point and walk out upon the ter
rible overhanging rock, that dangerous
mire him, and, being a man, he naturally
Boon saw what an impression he had made
on her. They talked to each other and the
young lady was surprised to discover that
her dusky Adonis aid talk fluently both
in English and Dutch. What th<Â»y talked
about only they two knew, but every one
can guess. Anyhow, they soon came to
an understanding and the result was that
all arrangements were made for a speedy
wedding.
Meanwhile, however. Miss Jewell's
friends had not been asleep. They saw
how the African had fascinated the weal
thy girl and they were determined that
he should not profit by it. They hoped
that it was merely a girl's wayward
fancy, but they were undeceived when the
bitter news of the proposed wedding
reached them. Then they rose up in arms.
They vowed that a cultured and wealthy
English girl should not become the wife
of an uncouth savage. But how could
they prevent the wedding? Miss Jewell
is 22 and can do as she pleases. They
knew that, and so, instead of remonstrat
ing, they pleaded with her not to ruin her
young life In this mad fashion. She lis
tened patiently to these pleas and finally
so much pressure was brought on her that
she consented to postpone the wedding.
No more extraordinary romance than
this has occurred In our day, and thou
sands who never jaw Miss Jewell or
Lobengula will be anxious to know how
It will end. That Lobengula should have
spent so much of his time In lovemaklng
while In London Is certainly surprising,
for the reason that other Matabeles who
have gone to the English capital have
apparently had no time to do anything
except to wonder at the extraordinary
sights around them. King Lobengula sent
emissaries to Queen Victoria a few years
ago. and London was to them the most
wonderful place on earth.
Some strange marriages are made now
adays, but this is apparently the first
time that a cultured and wealthy white
girl has set her affections on a native
African. That there should be a strong
opposition to the marriage Is not surpris
ing Lobengula may be. and very prob
ably is. a first-class fellow in his own
country, but there are very few persons
in England, if indeed there are any, who
think that he is fit to become Miss Jew
ell's husband.
Strange Cases of
Surgery.
Dr. Morestin. a Russian surgeon, who
had been treating a woman for recurring
abscesses, announced the recovery of his
patient the other day. He had removed
from her a pair of physician's hemostatlc
forceps, four Inches long, which had been
accidentally sewed up in her body four
years before.
Said a New York physician: "A Bhort
time ago an up-country doctor came to
the city to be operated upon for the re
moval of the vermiform appendix, al
though I understand he never had ap
pendicitis. He did not improve after the
operation, and one night he died. There
was an autopsy, and it was found that a
sponge had been sewed up in him. Yet I
have known of many forceps, clamps and
other metal Instruments to be forgotten
and left in patients, and the latter get
weli
"Sponges are bad. Prom their very na
ture they become collecting agents and
soon poison the body. The smooth metal
objects, on the other hand, are apt to
work their way Into the alimentary tract,
and then they soon pass away. You doubt
less have heard of needles which have
Btayed In the human body for years, grad
ually working their way out of the sys
tem, or of old soldiers who still carry the
bullets shot 'nto them during the civil
war. The glass swullower3 of the dime
museums really perform wonders in the
way of resisting foreign substances In the
human body.
"The most wonderful case of all was
that of an insane man whom I caw in an
asylum In Lancaster, Pa. He took to
swallowing things in the carpenter shop,
and before he was stopped he had gulped
down 140 nails of all sizes, some buckles,
a piece of old iron, some screws and a lot
of other things.
"All of this hardware was extracted and
the man recovered. He is still living and
still a lunatic."

tilting projection upon which one step
amisa would precipitate you three thou
sand feet down to the valley floor. WhUe
there were a few others venturesome
enough to go out upon this rock in day
light. Miss Hutchings would take the
awful risk of doing it at night, and with
unshaken courage stand there, and wav
ing above her head a flambeau afford to
the watchers far below in the valley a
spectacle which made their nerves tingle
with the knowledge they had of the dan
gers dared by the heroic young woman.
Some years ago Miss Hutching^ met
with a girl after her own heart. ShÂ«- was
the daughter of a San Francisco mer
chant, who had been bred in the city, but
who had become as enthusiastic a lover
of thÂ«Â» forest as the Yosemite Diana. To
gether they resolved upen a life of adven
ture, and obtaining horses and rifles they
started out to live as hunters. Week
after week and month after month they
ranged through tha mountains from the
Merced to Kings River, and from tho
western limits of tho Sierras to the oharp
declivity of Its eastern edge. They ex
plored every canyon, followed ever}' trail
and took every chance which is taken by
the woodman and the mountaineer. They
camped wherever night overtook them
and lived upon the game which their rifles
brought down. Occasionally some shcep
hardar or cartle-n.iui would ha Eiirnrlssd
at seeing two young: women, with rifles
swung from their saddle-bows, ride .Into
his lonely camp and offer to trade a
haunch of venlsen for a little flour or cof
fee.
This continued until the San Francisco
merchant, becoming genuinely alarmed
for his daughter's safety, succeeded in
finding: her and reasserting his authority.
He decided that as the best cure for such
romantic wildnesa the girl should be sent
East to attend a school, in which deport
ment and all the proprieties are a prom
inent feature of the curriculum. But she
refused to part from Miss Hutchings, and
as the only way to solve the difficulty the
latter was sent along, too. This educa
tional course lasted a couple of years, and
soon alter returning the San Francisco
girl was married to a gentleman who was
prominent in educational circles.
liisa Hutchirgs returned to her life in
the valley and to her habit of lonely
rambles. One of her favorite tricks was
to make the ride of twenty-six miles from
Wawona Into the valley after nightfall.
She would go down to Wawona to see
friends who lived there, would let the time
slip by until darkness began to gather,
and only then wnuH think of the neces
sity of starting homeward. -Laughing to
scorn the anxious advice not to attempt
in the darkness roads which other persons

mount the big black charger and start i
upon a gallop through the deep shadows i
of the forest. Phe would not always fol- <
low the road, but would sometimes try de- 1
tours and cut-offs, and It was while dolnÂ«: 1
this she met with the experience men- '
tloned in the beginning of this article.
The night was a stormy one, in ihe j
midst of a prolonged wet spell, when the
creeks and rivers were all converted into ]
torrents. The right was inky black, and
some of the Ycsemite people who reitte
this story say Miss Hutchings lost her
way and wandered at random through the
woods, But this is not credited by those
who know her best, for they do not be- '
lieve the darkest night could be dark '
enough to make her lose the way through,
the forest, an 1 they assert she was merely ',
taking a short trail. ,
In any event, she found herself riding
along the precipitous bank of one of the ,
forks of the Merced River, and before she
realized that the was in any danger she ;
felt her horse losing his footing and slip
ping and slid! ni? downward. Instantly eha
threw herself from the saddle, and she
and the horse together pitched and rolled
.down, as if to certain death. It seemed
to be a mere chance of being Wiled by the
fall or of being swept to death In the
swollen torrent.
Fortunately there was a projecting
ledge on which both horse and horse
woman landed. They were conscious that
they had been saved almost by a miracle
from death for the time being, but Inal
escape from such a fearful position was
more than doubtful. Miss Hutchings was
conscious that the shelf of rock was nar
row, and that any movement was danger
ous, ami the horse was no less aware of
It. for he shook and trembled in a tun
ing agony of fear. For once all the fire
\\. s taken out of the big black ch:trgf>r.
His mistress managed to slip off his sad
dle and bridle, thinking this might slightly
improve Ms chance to escape alive if he
should fall off the ledge Into the river.
For herself th<=r^ was nothing to do but
to wait for morning and some luclrr
chance. . It was impossible to climb up tne
bank before daylight came, and It was
euualli- out of. the auestion tg think of
moving down toward the river. It was
raining and sleeting-, and the night was as
cold as it was black. The woman and the
horse shivered through it in some way.
Inspired in their determination to main
tain their perilous foothold by catching
glimpses through the darkness of the
flashing foam in the torrent, which
showed where it dashed over the ragged
rocks that would have made a fall into its
water certain death.
Daylight came at last and with !t an
opportunity to escape. By crawling carr
fully along the bank, making use of hand
and foot holds. Miss Hutchings reached
a place of temporary safety on the edgo
of the stream, and in a little while shÂ»
succeeded In attracting the attention of a
rancher who lived on the farther side of
the stream, and who. taking no small risk
of losing his life, crossed the river in a
boat, which he had first made fast to a
tree by a long rope. Miss Hutchings was
rescued, and a little later the horse wxa
also taien out of his place of danger.
Every one else In the valley talk? of
Miss Hutchings' adventure as thrilling
almost beyond parallel, but she refers to
it with reluctance and declines to accept
the position of heroine. At the present
time Mise Hutchings Is acting as librarian
and secretary for the Sierra Club In To

Qirl as a JYaval
Architect.
A brlg-ht-faced girl works with hammer
and anvil at a forge In a shop next to the
railroad tracks in Boston. Her name ia
Lydia Gould Weld; the shop Is part of tha
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and she is studying: to be a naval archi
tect.
Miss Weld is 21 years old, and daughter
of the late Franklin Weld of Falmouth.
While attending- the Institute of Technol
ogy she lives with her relative, George F.
Seavera, in Morton street. Jamaica Plain.
She is an attractive girl of medium height,
with brown hair, blue eyes and a merry
laugh, which does not go at all with the
popular conception of the erudite woman.
| She has not had a college education in tho
classics, but is well up in mathematics.
Before coming to the Institute of Tech
nology she was a pupil at a fashionable
school In Bryn Miwr.
Miss Weld, says the St. Louis Republic,
made hÂ«r choice of the profession of ma
rine architecture a few years ago, when a
yachting party cf which she was one put
In at Bristol. R. 1., to repair a broken,
shaft. In looking- over the shops of the
HerreshoiTs while the work was being
done thÂ» desire to be a master of that
craft took possession of her and grew to
a serious purpose, in which she was hu
! mored by her family. In the same shop
j with Miss Weld are working about fifteen
; young men, some graduates of universities
or sons of manufacturers, who have here
more facilities for iearning rapidly than
In the shops of their fathers. Miss "Weld's
first lesson in forging consisted in ham
mering to a point the end of a short piece
of iron bar. Next she was given a foot
length of bar and told to make it into a
pointed rod with a ring on the end.
About this time the blisters began to
come. The first was ar the base of the
forefinger of the left hand. This burst,
and the continued abrasion of tho hammer
i handle turned the skin black, leaving a
| square half an inch so tender that an or
dinary girl would have cried had anything
touched it. No cries and no gloves for
Miss Weld â only more hammering.
A day or two later she made an iron
bracket like that used to support a man
tel. There are three nat! holes in
j arm of this bracket, which must he
punched and countersunk at the anvil.
In using the punch she missed it with one
awing of the heavy hammer and struck
the back of her left hand a hard blow,
peeling off the skin and raising a sweil
: in*.
! A hook and staple was one of her easi
j est pieces of work. She surprised h<=-r in
! structors with the ease with which she
made an iron strap similar to that used
i for suspending thp ends of timbers.
[ After that she tried fagot welding, be-
I ing given three scraps of iron, which she
j forged into single ba-. This is not so
I easy as it seems, and many an apprentice
blacksmith has become vexed in spirit to
see the cracks in plain sight and one or
two stray ends sticking out.
The most difficult of her tasks so far
has been the timber-hanger. Six or seven
years ago, says the Instructor, a young
man became so angry at the obstinacy
1 of the iron which he was trying to shape
I into this form that hi hurled the hated
thing through the open window to the
furthermost side of the railroad tracks
and walked out of the shop, leaving a
blue streak in the air as he passed. Two
or three days later he returned in humble
and determined spirit and managed to
conquer the troublesome bit of iron. This
is an indication that Mia? Weld's path is
not altogether one of rosos. and that the
j problems in forging- set before her are of
! the kind that would sometimes test the
patience of a saint.
The reporter asked the instructor if he
didn't give his " extraordinary student
more attention than the young men. but
he explained her proficiency by another
reason, saying:
"She is more than usually quick to com
prehend what is told her. In grasping the
! principles of forging she has proved her
i self the equal Of any of the young men.
Her use of the hammer is fully up to the
; average. She has a very strong arm and
â  does not appear to get tired. A few days
: ago I was busy in another part of the
' shop for a long time and was somewhat
' curious to know how was getting
I along. When I got back to her she asked
| me, jokingly, if I : ken her. I
i found that she had progressed as well as
I if I had been advising her, and she went
i right ahead until the job was done."

To extract the sugar from the beets

training Wallace. My answer Is: I
am training him as -I have trained all
the other lions whosa education â or,
rather, subjugationâ l have taken In
hand during the more than ten years that
X have been known to the public as a lion
tamer.
I am training him with a view to gain
ing first his tolerance, second his liking
and third his respect and obedience.
Wallace., as every one who has visited
thÂ« Chutes knowr. Is one of the finest
Wallace In /to CagÃr*
entirely different from that of extract
ing- sugar from cane. To get sugar
from cane it is only necessary to
squeeze out the juice, evaporate the
water anfi stir the residue to produce
granulation. This can ail be done on
:> small scale, but to get sugar out of
beets an elaboiate plant Is necessary.
I g to the nature of the bâ 'ts they
cannot be pressed or squeezed, because
the macerated fiber would produce a
disagreeable taste that could not be
got rid of during the manipulation
that follows.
Let us see how it is all done.
Out in the fields for miles and miles
around Salinas beets are ready to har
vest. The tops are not as green as
they were some weeks ago, which Indi
cate that they are ready to be made
into sugar.
First a man with a plow com^s along
and turns a furrow that throws the
specimens of his kind now In captlvtty.
He Is a forest-bred animal, untamed save
by the mere fact of captivity, which has
by no means broken his spirit, and he Is
mature, being seven years o!d, which In a
lion signifies that he has arrived at his
majority and is fully worthy of his title
as monarch of the beasts.
To tell the truth, Wallace Is by far the
hardest experiment that I have yet
attempted, for he has so far known no
living creature superior to himself.
Any lion-tamer knows that It Is far
beets out where they can be reached.
To pull them out of the ground, except
where they are very small, would re
quire the strength of a mule coupled
with a derrick. Then another man
comee with a long knife that
looks like a machete and cuts off the
green tops at a puint just above tha
sugar-bearing section. Then the beets
are thrown into a wagon and hauled to
the factory. First they are weighed
and then dumped into the receiving
bine. Some beets from a distance come
to the factory In freight cars. These
are run up onto a platform and with a
hydraulic pump the entire car is turned
over and the contents dumped into the
receiving bins. They are now ready
for the trip through the factory to come
out in the form of brown sugar all
ready for the refiner.
It is necessary, In order to keep the
factory running, that the beets flow
better, both as regards personal safety
and educational results, to begin tha
training: of a lion while, he Is yet a very
young- cub. My Prince, who Is second to
no performing: lion In the world, I brought
up, as one might say, on a bottle. I
cuddled and petted him and carried him
about with me and fairly loved him Into
doing what I wanted him to do.
At the present time I am trying to get
upon good terms with Wallace. I visit
him every morning and feed him with
my own hands. There Is a platform built

Into It In a steady stream. The be
ginning of this iÂ« at tho big bins. At
the bottom of each of these is a con
duit with a stream of water running
through it. When the beets are dumped
into the bins they fall upon a bottom
of heavy boards laid in position loosely
over the water. When the bins are
full the boards at each end are lifted
out and the beets allowed to fall into
the stream of water beneath. They are
now started on the journey through the
factory and nothing can stop them ex
cept some derangement of the ma
chinery.
'Beets. are composed of about 95 per
cent water and v per cent fibrins. In
the tiny cells of the fiber the sugar
exists in a free stats. The first thing
to do is to open these cells and let the
sugar get out.
When ths beeta reach the corner of
the factory where the work begins they
Â£y /tdgier*
so that I am on a level with him, and I
get up on this and talk to him and give
him meat and milk. He has already
grown accustomed to my near presence
and will come to me when I call him.
After another week I hope to be able to
enter his cage, but it is necessary to be

better off outside.
are seized by elevating screws and raised
to the washing tanks, where by a pro
cess of scrubbing: and scouring every
particle of foreign matter is removed
from the outsides. The beets then find
their way into great buckets that hoist
them skyward into the big distributing
boxes. From here they drop down into
the cutters, where by razor-like knives
they are cut into tlie thinnest khid of
stringy slices. Then comes a bath in
the diffusion tanks. This is always at
a gentle temperature and absorbs
nearly all of the sugar out of the beet
slices. The fiber is now of no use in
sugar making and a straining process
removes it out of the building to a
place where It can be converted Into
cattle food.
The rest of the sugar making process
consists of removing the very fine par
ticles of vegetable fiber, evaporating
the water and causing 1 crystallization.
One* I succeed In being: admitted I shall
go In dally, armed with a small Iron rod
and a light piece of board wide enough
to form a kind of shield for my body.
Then I shall put him through the regu
lar course of Instruction. I shall make
him Jump the bars by driving him around
the cage and standing directly In his
way when he wants to pass. He has
either got to Jump me or the bars in
order to go by, and the bars are lower,
bo he Jumps them. Of course all lions
are liable to strike out and snap at you; â
The first of these is accomplished by
mixing the fluid with milk of lime in
the carbonization tanks. A boiling
then takes place and most of the im
purities are precipitated, but to make
doubly sure the clear fluid is put
through the filter presses that takes
out the finest kind of fiber. This pro
cess is repeated several times until
the fluid remaining is practically only
pure sugar and water. Then comes the
concentration of this juice.
This is accomplished in great closed
pans or evaporators heated by steam.
The sugary fluid passes from one
chamber to another, all the time get
ting thicker and thicker. When the
right point is reached it is drawn off
Into the vacuum-pan. This intricate
apparatus allows the fluid to be boiled
at a very low temperature, so that
crystallization begins. When crystals
of the proper size can be taken from
It Is your business to watch, Interpose the
bit of board. Jump back, and then â punish
them.
The rules for lion-taming: may be con
densed into two: First make your sub
ject familiar with your presence; sec
ond, make him or her understand that
you intend to be obeyedâ that you see
everything:, know everything, and are all
powerful. The first sign of weakness,
mental or physical, ruins you with the
Hon.
The lion Is treacherous anS he isâ when

the vacuum-pan the syrup Is allowud
to flow below into the centrifugal ma
chines.. Hern it is whirled around at
a speed equivalent to two miles a min
ute, so that every drop of uncrystal
lized syrup is forced out through tha
sides, leaving the finished product be
hind. This is sugar. And the beet
reaches this condition eighteen hours
after it was started through the con
duit from the bin.
But all the sugar has not been taken
out of the fluid. The second and third
grades remain. These are taken out by
returning the syrup to the vacuum-pan
and again heating It and putting It
through a granulation machine. This
yields the second grade of Eug*ar. A
repetition of the process yields thÂ« third
grade. The product is now put In sacks
and sent to the refinery to come out In
the form of pure white oubÂ«s and pQej

enter his cage, suddenly remembered thÂ»
