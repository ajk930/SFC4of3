VOLUME LXXXVI- NO. 135.
SENSATIONAL REPORT ON CONDITIONS IN PHILIPPINES
JUST FILED BY A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT AGENT
A Commissioner Sent to the
Islands Makes Startling
Disclosures Regarding the
Existing Conditions.
SPANISH FRIARS SHOULD
BE SHORN OF roWER ;
In regard to the power of the churcn
in the Islands, I have given the subject
much attention and careful thought, and
I conclude that the Spanish friars and
the holy orders had in the past, and still
have, more power than is good for the
development of the Philippines. I have
expressed to you and in the press my
great admiration for the Catholic divines
who accompanied our army as chaplains.
I think th Catholic religion the best re
ligion for the natives of the Philippines.
But the insidious rule of the priests and
friars is undoubtedly working an injury
to the cause of advancement in the Phil
ippine Islands. Again and again men of
high degree and low In the Philippines
assured me that they loved the Catholic
church and were loyal to the Catholic
faith, but hated the friars as the gates of
hell.
Of course, the power of the holy orders
is sometimes overestimated. For exam
ple, I learn that on farms near Manila,
which these orders rented to the natives
for three cents an acre per year, the peo
ple complained, notwithstanding the rea
sonable rent. f
There are Americans going into
Manila who do not represent even the
average class of American citizens.
Take some of the civilians. There is
a Mr. Brown, whose name is Baran
ski. and a Mr. Carmen, associated to
gether in the American Commercial
Company. I have it on the authority
of Mr. Kaelin and Timothy W. Coak
iey of ',â c rmnppmes-American Com
pany that Carmen and Brown sell
tomatoes for $7 50 per case, whereas
the duty on tomatoes is $8 per case.
It is said that Carmen came to Manila
six months ago a penniless man, and
that to-day he has a monopoly of the
nipa thatch and the cascos for trans
portation on the Pasig River. Brown
is often seen with American officers
when these officers are intoxicated,
taking them to his home. Everybody
tries to get a saloon. General Otis
will not give a license to an ex-sol
dier. This is good as far as it goes,
but it goes such a short way that it
only irritates the ex-soldiers.
The abuses referred to in the above
paragraph are undoubtedly caused by the
â fact that we retain
the Impractical du
ties of the Spanish
regime in force. The
continuing of these
Spanish laws, in my
judgment, is an irri
tant to the people,
and only makes the
wound opened by the
war still deeper and
more exasperating.
The European resi
dents who have lived
in Manila for many
years assert unlver-
sally that taxes were
Gene-a! Otis.
J ereo grievous un-
Jer the Spanish rule as they are now under
our martial law. Of course, they under
stand that it is war time, but to have
martial law for more than a year ln a city
of 900,000 inhabitants must work hardship
to the vast mass of the people. I have
often talked to Filipinos, and found they
were brooding over these taxes and feel
ing that it was a wrong and an outrage.
You cannot convince them that it was a
military necessity, and so one of the
measures necessary to bring the war to a
close keeps It going on.
AGUINALDO HAS A
GREAT DEAL OF POWER
As far as the relation of one tribe i
to another goes, the tribes will fight !
one another when they get out of a j
job, but as a rule I think the Fili- ;
pinos, especially the Tagalos and
Visayans, are pretty much under the
influence of Aguinaldo. I do not
think they fear Aguinaldo, because i
he really could not reach them in ,
Cebu or Iloilo; but I genuinely think '
the people in the islands generally
would rather have an ' autonomous 'â 
Government under an American pro- j
tectorate than anything like a colo- ;
nial or annexation arrangement. It
will be a great deal easier to restore j
peace when you have 65,000 or 70,- i
000 soldiers in the islands; but that '
the rebels will ever give up their \
arms I do not believe. They will give j
up those arms that the Americans ;
corral and take from them; otherwise j
1 think they will hide away their ;
Mausers for another revolution. It is j
sometimes said that Aguinaldo has j
very little power, but I think that he j
has far more power than we are in
clined to admit. His name is one to
conjure with. I have never seen a
Filipino who would not turn his ear
and listen, if the magic name of j
Aguinaldo was mentioned. This man
must have some great traits of char
acter-

CORRUPTION MD DISHONESTY
COMMON IN THE ARMY
Rumors of dishonesty and corrupt
officialism in our army are so common
in Manila that it seems to me that
there must be some truth in them.
Thus, we hear that an English con
tractor sold 150 mules to the Govern-
ment, but had to pay lj>6ooo to have
his contract accepted. The truth of
this transaction I cannot be certain
of, but I feel quite certain about one
thing which was told me by a most
responsible person, Mrs. Br. Beer,
chief of the Red Cross Society of Col
orado. She said that a Chinese
woman who contracted to sell vege
tables, eggs, etc., to the American
hospitals came to her and asked her
to try to influence the proper officials
to continue her contract. She said to
Mrs. Beer that she had been paying
the Americans 20 per cent commis
sion on the goods she sold the Gov
ernment, and they wanted 25 per
cent, which was more than she could
pay and make a reasonable profit. I
think the impression was growing
among the Spaniards and Filipinos,
as well as our own people in Manila,
when I left, that some of the Ameri
can civilians and soldiers could give
the Spaniards cards and spades and
beat them at the game of theft.
There is no use for any American
civilian trvincr to tret
into Luzon just now
to start a business
because if he takes
in his merchandise
honestly through the
Custom house it
would be impossible
for him to make a
living. These things
are not pleasant to
say, but when your
own countrymen all
through the city
laugh and sneer at
such things there
must be some truth
in them. I know that
Aguinaid
our soldiers aredescending from the poetry
of history to the prose of shame. They
oftentimes levy blackmail on the people
of the city, going, for example, into a
Chinaman's house and charging him $3
for the tax of his piano. So much is this
carried on, that a day of two before I
came away the walls of Manila were
plastered with a proclamation of General
Otis in Spanish, English and Tagah g,
calling attention to the fact that no citi
zen should pay taxes to any one except
at the places established by the Govern
ment. Of course, it is very difficult to
see how these things can be helped. I
am of the strong opinion that our officers
are too strict on the men In relation to
their conduct around the camp and in
places where it conduces to the comfort
or discomfort of the officers; but that
they are not strict enough with them
when they go out on the streets, or In
other words, when their conduct conduces
to the comfort or discomfort of the gen
eral nubile.
RED CROSS SUPPLIES
STOLEN BY OFFICERS
Then it will depend upon how
justly the people we send there treat
the Filipinos. Nobody could justly
have the idea that either the Ameri
can Government or people mean to
oppress the inhabitants of the Phil
ippines, but many of the agents
sent there are undoubtedly cor
rupt. For instance, I saw on the
books of the Red Cross Society of
California to-day an account of how
two young fellows, one an army offi
cer and the other a Red Cross officer,
had stolen the supplies of the Red
Cross Society and sold them, and
have now gone into business and are
now prosperous business men in
Manila. As long as dishonesty and
cruelty are possible with our soldiers
and civilians I do not think thero will
be any lasting peace in the Philip
pines, but I do think that if the cam
paign was given into the hands of
one man who was competent to run
the civil administration we could
have peace; in other words, by send
ing men above politics or bribes or
flattery men of . large brain, whose
honor is unstained and who, are hon
est and sincere .without being affect-.

The Call gives below the most important and most sensational official report on the J
5 present condition of affairs in the Philippines ever filed with this Government. It was ?
5 made by a special agent of the War Department, who has been secretly investigating ?
5 affairs on the islands for some time past, and who has just filed the startling result of his 5
' labors with Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn. f
It is a plain and exhaustive portrayal of the true condition of affairs in the Philip- J
' pines, and is made by a man backed by our Government and empowered to get at the very a
I heart of official corruption. It tells plainly and directly of the jealousy, bickerings and dis- s?
â¢ honesty of certain officers in the army and navy, of the misinformation constantly sent out a
5 to the public, of the shameful treatment of the wives and daughters of the natives by some J
'â¢ of the American troops, of the gross incompetency of many political appointees and of the * s
I heartless conspiracies on the part of men in public and private life there to rob both the na- &
â¢ fives and this Government. â¦
â¢ For obvious reasons the administration has not yet made public this extraordinary â¦
â  report. â¦

cd. The deepest danger in the Philip
pines is that we have men in high
offices there who are utterly incapable
of studying the problem from a psy
chological standpoint; who can do no
governing but simply to damn and
kick "niggers."
ARMY OFFICERS JEALOUS
OF ONE ANOTHER
There is a good deal of Jealousy be
ween the high officers of the army, and
that makes it dlffl-
â uit to iorce matters
o a focus with the
Filipinos. Thus, for
'xample, when Law

Iro Mac Arthur's di

eason for Lawton's
movement was, to get down fromArayatto

him between Malolos and San Fernando.

whom I have talked with about this
maneuver all seemed to feel that we had

General Hale
HERE ARE A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS THAT WERE
REACHED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENT.
/]GUINALDO has more power than we are inclined to admit. His name is one to conjure with.
v* It will be a good deal easier to restore peace when you have 65,000 or 70,000 soldiers
in the Islands, but that the rebels will ever give up their arms I do not believe.
It seems unfortunate to retain General Otis in command. He has entirely lost the confi
dence of the soldiers and civilians in the Philippines.
Many of the agents sent here are undoubtedly corrupt. Two young officers stole sup
plies of the Red Cross, sold them, and are now prosperous business men in Manila.
The deepest danger in the Philippines is that we have men In high offices who can do no
governing but to simply damn and kick "niggers."
Men like Funston could have taken command of the army, and men like Irving Hale would
be very well suited for the civil government.
The Filipino Peace Commissioners were sharper diplomatists than ours.
The Tagals who are at the head of the revolution are the smartest, brightest and best of
all the Filipinos.
A silly decree was published, and, I believe upheld by General Otis, that all marriages
that have thus far been performed in the Philippines by Protestant clergymen are null and void.
While we have allowed our soldiers all to gamble, the Tagals watch us at cards and craps
and fully realize that cockfights (which have been abolished) are no worse.
I am surprised that John Barrett should state in the Review of Reviews that the people of
Cebu asked our protection. The records show that Cebu was surrendered to the Americans
under protest.
* There Is a good deal of jealousy between the high officers of the army.
If offices cannot be filled by men of merit it will be dangerous for the United States to
hold the Philippines.
movement on San Fernando. These
operations, it is true, gave us ten or fif
teen miles of railroad, but it left the
enemy as secure and defiant as ever.
RETENTION OF OTIS
IS UNFORTUNATE
I think it is absolutely necessary
to give the command of the army to
one strong man under the direction
of one strong brain. If I may be al
lowed to suggest, it seems unfortu
nate to retain General Otis in com
mand of the Philippines. He may
have all the qualifications and have
the confidence of the Gevernment, but
inasmuch as he has entirely lost the
confidence of the soldiers and civil
ians in the Philippines I think you
will find it more difficult to handle
things with him as Governor General
than you would if you had a new
man a man like General Leonard
Wood or ' General Irving Hale. The
great qualities of some of the younger
men in the Philippines, I feel sure,
have been overlooked. Men like Fun
ston could have taken full command
of the army, and men like Irving
Hale would be very well suited for
the civil Government, There must be
thousands of men in America who
have great business capacity and who
would accept for a brief time the Gov
ernor Generalship. I have the utmost
. respect personally for General Otis,
and believe him to be a much ma
ligned man. I feel sure that he is a
man of great ability in many ways,
but somehow the popular pulse does
not beat his way.
I am sorry I have to differ somewhat
from the opinions of Dr. Sehurman, as
they have been published in the dis
patches. Perhaps these are not his opin
ions, but I think he is very right if he
believes that the people of the towns and
provinces are practically able to run their
own affairs. I did not think this way at
first, but study and observation have con
vinced me that the Filipinos have a good
deal of latent intelligence. I do not
agree, however, with Dr. Sehurman if he
thinks that the sphere of hostility to
America is a small
one. In fact, the
gruff behavior of our
people, especially in
Manila, Is very of
fensive to the people
of the Islands. I am
upheld in this belief
by men unbiased' like
the French, German
and Russian corre
spondents, men who
really like the Amer
icans. Most of the
unprejudiced Ameri
cans think the same
way. We are too free
and easy in some
jeneral Funston
cases and too strict and rough with the
people in some other cases. It needs
wise, c^lm and disinterested mci: -to rep
resent us in the islands. Whether they
are right or not I do not presume to say,
but the natives of all the islands I visit
ed, Cebu, Negros, Panay, Sulu and Lu
zon, all seemed to feel that we are the
aggressors; except the people of Jolo, who
do not believe that we are going to es
tablish a very firm government over them
or one distinctively American.
PEOPLE OF CEBU DID
NOT ASK OUR PROTECTION
I am surprised that John Barrett
should state in the Review of Re
views that . the people of Cebu
asked our protection. On the con
trary, I have read the records of the
American occupation of Cebu in the
diary of the German Vice Consul,
who is a Scotchman, a British citizen
and the only foreigner I found enthu
siastic for American rule in the Phil
ippines. Mr. Cummings made an en
try like this:
"Cebu was surrendered to the
Americans, under protest, by the in
fluence of Majie and Llorente, the two
ablest Filipinos in Cebu.
"The young men of Cebu advised
to burn the town, but wiser counsels
prevailed. Majie said to the com
mander of the Petrel that, finding
ing themselves abandoned by Spain,
they had joined the Filipino Repub
lic. They had no orders from Aguin
aldo, but would yield only under pro
,test, owing to the greater force of the
Americans. At 9:40 the Americans
landed forty sailors, who raised the
Stars and Stripes amid a sullen and
angry populace who wanted to attack
the Americans."
This is quoted to show you what a vast
amount of misinformation there has been
regarding the Philippines, and to show
you how absolutely necessary it is to send
only the best heart and brains of the
country to try and establish a govern
ment which shall satisfy these people. A
large part of our army openly sympa
thizes with many of the Filipino conten
tions. This is especially marked in the
volunteer regiments and is also very
marked among the older men of the reg
ular army. Even here in California,
which of all States will benefit most from
the trade of the Philippines, opinion is
much divided.

The second day after the first negro
regiment landed in Manila I saw a negro
soldier take the money belt off a China
man in front of Major Devol's office amid
the laughter of our own people, civilians
and soldiers. Corporal Harvey of Major
Devol's office threw a Filipino on the
paving stones just because he was in the
way. An assistant clerk in the same office
struck a Filipino standing beside me on
the stomach. On being remonstrated with
he exclaimed, "He is only a damned

INFAMOUS TREATMENT OF
THE NATIVE WOMEN
An American chaplain in Malabon,
whose name I withhold, told me
that in his first parish work he had
been told by the natives of Malabo.,
that their wives and daughters had
been raped by our soldiers. He could
authenticate only five cases. The pa
pers of that date (September 15) say
that two men in Manila have been
condemned to death for maltreating
native women. I saw again and again
the brothels of Manila crowded to the
doors by our soldiers, and the saloons
also. All these things may be ; un
avoidable at times. They show how
necessary it is to have the right dis
cipline, i General Hughes kept Manila
in the best order. A Boston lawyer

to his office on the Escolta of natives
who had been maltreated. These peo
ple said: "Your soldiers who came
into the towns first are very bad men,
but those who come later are very
kind men." I can explain this to you.
The men often got ahead of their offi
cers and committed outrages until
the officers came up.
General Lawton told me that he had
hard work to stop looting. He was very
good on this. One of the Kansas boys
told me "Funston is hard nuts on _nn
keyin' with the dead; the boys burned
the wooden Christs and stole the brass
Jesuses off the crucifixes." Jean Hess of
the Figaro is practically correct in his
notes on the campaign, but he does not
understand the Americans. The Filipino
peace commissioners were sharper diplo
matists than ours. I Interviewed Dr. Sehur
man for the Associated Press. He was
a good, strong man, and fair-minded, but
he did not see so much of the Filipino
question as the reporters. These men who
signed the round-robin against censorship
are to my certain knowledge reliable men.
Bass and Collins are especially conserva
tive.
THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED.
In conclusion let me sum up. First, we
need to study the question psychological
ly. These people are not as our people.
Our very voices rasp them. Individual
Americans, civilians and soldiers, treat
them arrogantly, as if already they were
our slaves. The Filipinos never forget:
they never forgive; they are highly sensi
tive, easy to flatter, but impossible to fool;
they are very bitter, very brave, very per
sistent. We need on our side great tact,
absolute discipline, stainless honor, in
corruptible â otherwise a legacy of
hate and bloodshed. This is as certain as
the decrees of God. -
Secondly â For the Philippines we
must have civil service. There are
instances all over of incompetency.
Captain Hanna, captain of the port
of Iloilo, is not fit for the place. I
saw him behave in a very ungentle
manly way to a Spanish captain.
Many other things show that he is
no man for the place. There are doz
ens of such men, and they are polit
ical appointees, and are no good in
such positions, but do us lots of harm.
If the offices cannot be filled by men
of merit it will be dangerous for the
United States to hold the Philippines.
Thirdâ Martial law in Manila ought to
be abolished as soon
as possible. There
seems to be no rea
sonable ground for it
at present. The Span
ish taxes ought to be
recast at once, if fur
ther trouble, both
with Americans and
foreigners, is to be
avoided. Absolutely
strict discipline of
our soldiers in their
relation to the na
tives, especially to
the women, is neces
sary. I note, in the
newspaper dis-
General Mac Arthur
patches that two soldiers have been
sentenced to death for maltreating
women. If this be true, you will see the
ground for my remark.
Fourth Our Congress ought to be
called at once to give the Filipinos
some promise of government. It is
claimed by men familiar with the
subject in Luzon that our Govern
ment has not promised them any
thing except the most attenuated
generalities. The Chino-Tagals, who
are the leaders in the movement, are
among the shrewdest men on earth.
They know the difference between an
absolute statement and a diplomatic
evasion, and unless some promise is
made of a very definite character, in
my judgment ' the war will . not cease
with the conquest of Aguinaldo.

SPECULATION AS TO
THE CHARTER DECISION
Supreme Court Will Adjourn the
Session in Los Angeles Mon
day and Come Here.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12.â Attaches in
and about the Supreme Court chambers
have been bothered all day with inquiries
as to when the decision upon the San
Francisco charter may be expected. Hun
dreds of inquiries have been pouring in on
the subject during the past twenty-four
hours. There has been no official intima
tion anywhere, so far as can be learned,
that the decision is to be delivered while
the court is in session here. San Fran
cisco, however, is evidently of that opin
ion. The Supreme Court will conclude its
labors here to-morrow evening, and most
of the members will arrive in San Fran
cisco on' the owl train Saturday morning.

of the revolution are the smartest,
brightest and best of all the Filipinos.
They have great power with their tribes.
It is not true that this power is gained
through terrorism. It is gained because
there is a spirit of nationality abroad In
the Philippines to-day. This is what
made it so easy for Aguinaldo's emissar
ies to gain control in Panay, Cebu, South
Luzon and Mindanao. Of the final dis
position of the Philippines I have no sug
gestion to make. That lies with the peo
ple of the United States. At present the
zone of hostility to the United States
authority is very wide in the islands.
owing in part, I think, to our lack of
success in dealing with the people.
Hatred of Americans has developed and
increased as we have advanced in our
occupation. The abolition of cock-fight
ing and the retaining of taxes has griev
ously offended the Filipinos. While we
have allowed our soldiers all to gamble,
the Tagals watch us at our cards and
"craps" and fully realize that cock-fight
ing is no worse.

so that both we and
they should have our minds made up as
to what our permanent relations should
be. The manner of dealing with the peo
. pie of Sulu is, I believe, the proper one
â¢in dealing with the Filipinos, although
opponents of the administration will say,
with some degree of justice, that we
should not have encouraged the Datto
Mundi, the Mohammedan, to take venge
ance on the Christians of Mindanao.
This will undoubtedly be used by the
hostile press. Moreover, to send Indians
to the Philippines will be apt to have a
reactionary effect upon the people of the
country, because it was one of the ob
jections made by William Pitt in the
House of Commons that England intro
duced into her warfare with the Americans
the "scalping knife and the tomahawk of
the savage."
REPLACE THE FRIARS
WITH AMERICAN PRIESTS
Seventh â The Spanish friars should
go home to Spain and American
priests take their places, granting to
the Filipino "padres'' the full rights
of priesthood, which they have never
had under Spain. Religion should be
let alone or wisely guided. Catholi
cism is best suited for them at the
present time. Protestants should
have the same rights as Catholics all
through the islands. A silly decree
was published (and, I believe, upheld
by General Otis) that all marriages
that have thus far been performed in
the Philippines by Protestant clergy
men are null and void. It caused a
great deal of unfavorable sentiment
among the Americans, who would not
tolerate such a measure.
These are my opinions and ob
servations. They are given with
out fear and without favor and I hope
they will be of use to you in considering
the question. If I am wrong time will
very soon show it, and if I am right there
is no use sending you flattering words
which only take up your time and throw .
no light on the question. I hope for the
President and his Cabinet all success in
dealing with -the Philippine problem, and
have no doubt that j their painstaking
work will in the end : bring good results,
although at times, they may be criticized
by an ungrateful public.

WILL TRY TO SECURE BOTH
NATIONAL CONVENTIONS
Prominent San Francisco Public Men Are Confident That by Proper
Effort This City Can Secure the Two Big Political
Gatherings of Next Year*
Senator Perkins, Congressmen Loud and Kahn, Mayor Pheian and Other Influential Men
Promise Their Hearty Co-operation in the Work of Achieving This Success.
CALIFORNIA may have the honor of
playing host to the national lead
ers of both great political parties
in 1900. It is the opinion of those
who are In close touch with the
condition of political affairs In the East
that by proper effort San Francisco may
be made the seat of the next National
Republican and National Democratic con
ventions. This city made a bid for this
distinction some years ago, but had then
to contend with conditions which have
since been eliminated.
At that time it was admitted that San
Francisco's claims were well founded, but
certain circumstances, due largely to her
geographical position, were against, her.
Apprehension was felt thai her hob ac
commodations would prove Insufficient:
that large crowds could not be properly
handled; that telegraphic facilities were
inadequate; that the distance from the
great centers of population was too great.
as too much time would have to be con
sumed in making the Journey across the
continent; and political combinations had
to be made that precluded San Francisco
from carrying off the prize of being
chosen the convention seat.
Since that time San Francisco has had
ample opportunities to test most of these
objections, and has most successfully
demonstrated that they do not. at least
at the present time, exist. The capacity
of the city and the ability of the people of
San Francisco to take care of large
crowds of visitors with comfort and safety
was well Illustrated during the convention
of the Christian Endeavor societies a few
years ago, and more recently on the re
turn of the California volunteers.
The telegraphic facilities of San Fran
cisco have also been put to the test, and
were not found wanting. As for distance
and time, these factors have been greatly
reduced in Importance by the changes that
have been made and are to be made in the
transportation of passengers between the
East and San Francisco. The time from
Chicago to San Francisco will be but three
days, while the trip from New York, the
other extreme of the continent, will con
sume but an additional day.
It is proposed to make the movement
to bring these great and Influential bodies
of men to California a strictly non-par
tisan project. The object in view will
be the advancement of the material pros
perity of the State and its neighboring
commonwealths by bringing their rich
and innumerable resources to the direct
attention of some of the men who are
most influential in the affairs of the na-
-It* Is expected that not only will indi
viduals be interested and attracted by
the opportunities for investment on this
side of the Rocky Mountains, but much
will be done to impress upon public men
the needs of the coast in the way of ap
propriations for public improvements and
other national legislation.
Congressman Julius Kahn is enthusi
astic over the project and is confident
that it can be carried to a successful
consummation.
"It seems to me," he said, "that If San
Francisco has any intention of securing
the national conventions this Is her op
portunity. That McKinley will be re
nominated Is practically conceded by
everybody. The element of uncertainty
which makes it necessary for the Repub
lican convention to be held at some point
where the party managers are within
easy telegraphic communication with
other prominent men will be entirely
eliminated from the approaching conven
tion. There is no uncertainty as to who
will be the Republican party nominee
and I am satisfied that San Francisco
can thus early secure the hearty co
operation of many of the national, com
mitteemen if her citizens make an earnest
effort to secure the conventions.

â¦ PORTLAND, Oct. Light snow â¦
-â¦- fell over the higher altitudes of â¦
â¦ Oregon, Washington and Idaho last -f
+ night and to-day. +
ELMIRA, Oct. Rain commenced
falling at 10 o'clock to-day, and the
downpour was steady. At noon .17 of an
inch had fallen, and there was no benefit
except to lay the dust. No damage was
done to the dried fruit and the grain,
which was mostly under cover.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. About 4 o'clock
this morning a heavy rain commenced to
fall here which has completely cleared the
atmosphere of the smoke, which has been
very bad on account of the forest fires.
The rain was hailed with pleasure by
everybody except the grape growers, who
have not finished picking and the fruit
men who still have the fruit in the dry
ing yards. The precipitation was .25 of
an inch.
MONTEREY, Oct. 12.â The rain that
began falling at midnight Tuesday
throughout this section is apparently not
over yet. Heavy showers fell during the
early morning and to-day, and a warm
southwest wind, with considerable cloud!-
ness, still prevails. It Is believed this lo
cality will receive about an inch of rain
before the storm is over.
NAPA, Oct. 12.â Rain began falling at
10 a. m. to-day. There was no damage
to crops.
UKIAH. Oct. 12.â During the storm
thirty-two hundredths of an Inch of rain
has fallen. It was providential. The for
est fires have all been, extinguished' and
vegetation has been started. For a month
past fires have been raging in the. rod
woods and much damage had been done.
PLEASANTON, Oct. 12.â From Wednes
day morning up to 5 o'clock to-night
fifty-hundredths of an inch of rain had
fallen in this section. The damage to
hay has not been very great so far and
If It dries up to-morrow little damage will
be done. Grapes have been much dam
aged, though the loss to this fruit cannot
yet be estimated. '..' . /'-
WOODLAND. Oct. 12.â weather is
cold and threatening, but so far only one
light shower has fallen, and that was not
sufficient to do, any damage. The vine
yardlsts have not yet begun to pick the
second crop of grapes and not more than
half the raisin crop has been cured. A
1;.-; ivy rain now would cause a big loss to
the raisin and wine industries.
MERCED, Oct. 12.â Rain began falling
here yesterday morning, continuing at in

day was nine one-hundredths of an inch.
To-day at noon eighteen one-hundredths

THE SAJS FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1899.
I months have all gone away from here
j filled with gratitude to. our people, and
| they have Invariably expressed them
; selves as being anxious to show their ap
: preciation of the generous hospitality of
| our citizens in some tangible form. Their
j influence with their National Committee
men'would be of great assistance to us.
and I believe that that influence would be
exerted without stint or hesitation.
"Asa general thing the conventions are
held, during the month of June. This Is
a season of the year when the heat in
most of the Eastern cities is. overpower
ing. ' We all remember the pictures in the
illustrated papers of the last national con
ventions, where the delegates sat around
coatless and hatless with fans .in their
; hands, trying to raise a breath of air.
'â¢ Here in San Francisco during the month
I of June the climate Is cool, invigorating
and bracing. We have ample hotel accom-
I modations for all the delegates and visit
ors who may come, and that the city Is
capable of handling large crowds was
I demonstrated recently upon the arrival of
the First California Volunteers."
Henry T. Scott, chairman of the anti
' boss Republican organization- of this city,
Is a strong advocate of the proposition.
"I would be very glad to see the next
national convention held in San Francisco.
It would certainly be a great thing for
i the community and the State and would
do much to gain recognition for San Fran
cisco as the great commercial port which
she is destined to be. No better means
of advertising the advantages of our sec
tion of the country could be devised. No
effort should be spared to secure this
great honor and advantage."
United States Senator Perkins declared
that he has always been and is now in
favor of bringing the national convention
to this city. "It will bring the most rep
resentative men of the nation to our
State." said he, "and will be of vast bene
fit to every enterprise and industry. Each
citizen should become a missionary in this
cause. Personally I shall do everything
within my power at all times and in all
places to bring victory to the banner of
San Francisco. I am always for Califor
nia, first and last."
As president of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association A. Sbarboro had
this to say of the project:
"It has been proved that the gathering
'â  of a large number of people for whatever
purpose in a large city Is a great advan
'. tage to the community. Therefore I be
lieve that this city should do all in its
power to have the conventions meet here.
By seeing our city and State many cap
italists may find inducements either to
settle here or to Invest some of their sur
plus capital, all of which would redound
to the benefit of the State, j
"We have shown how Californians can
entertain large crowds both as to the lib
eral subscriptions for money required and
I men are especially benefited, as grass will
now be abundant No damage is reported
in this section. The rain was a great help
to mining in Mariposa County.
VISALIA, Oct. D.uring the past
twenty-four hours .31 of an inch of rain
has fallen in Tulare County. Practically
no damage was done to crops. Stockmen
and ranchers are jubilant, as plenty of
pasture is now assured. A few raisin
growers Buffered slight loss, but it was
mostly their own fault In not heeding the
warning from the Weather Bureau. Had
rain occurred twenty-four hours sooner
hundreds of tons of prunes would have
been damaged. â_â¢_â¢Â»_*
BAKERSFIELD, Oct. Light rain
fell nearly all day Wednesday, .out
amounted to only one-tenth of an inch.
Some damage was done the raisins and
prunes, though the bulk of both crops
was saved. September having been un

and considerable hay was out. Farmers
and orcharaists are now rushing in all
â â  crops. ...
HOLLISTER. Oct. 12â The rain which
1 commenced here last Tuesday night and
- continued intermittently ever since has
amounted to about .25 of an Inch.
Farmers are looking forward to a wet
winter, and preparing to put in an im
mense acreage If the rains turn out right.
PETALUMA, Oct. This city was
visited to-day by a heavy downpour of
rain, which seemed to please farmers ,in
general. Some slight damage will be done
to grapes, and considerable hay is out yet.
i but it is claimed that the benefit from rain
! will more than doubly cover the damage.
i SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. Twenty
i four hundreths of an Inch of rain fell here
in the last twenty-four hours. There has
1 been no damage to crops, although it
, has interfered considerably with the
thrashing of grain owing to the unusual
ly large yield in this section. Thrashing
will not be through with for at least
another month.
SANTA CRUZ, Oct. 12.â Heavy showers
j fell all day in this city. Light rains fell
' at Ben Lomond and up the coast to Pes
i cadero. Grapes on the vines will be dam-
I aged, and exposed hay will suffer. Much
of this year's crop of grapes has already
, been gathered.
SONOMA, Oct. 12.â A heavy rain set in
' this morning and continued at intervals
. throughout the day. , At times the pre
i cipitation amounted to a downpour.
1 Should the lain continue there will be
i much damage to grapes, about one-third

scarcity of threshers much grain ' yet
being unthreshed. On . the whole, how
ever, the rain has been beneficial and
the threshers jubilant over the prospects.
MODESTO, Oct. 12.â This county has
experienced cold and stormy weather
during the past three days. The rain
fall has varied from .56 of an inch in the
eastern portion to a trace in the western
section. Harvesting is over and the only
damage will be to dry feed. Indications
to-night are for more ruin.
COLUSA, Oct. 12.â rainy season
commenced to-day, but up to this evening
also by the manner In which the citizens
have entertained privately. I am sure
that citizens of all political parties would
join in giving the conventions a hearty
welcome." â¢
Congressman Eugene F. Loud, who re
turned from a three months' trip to
Europe yesterday, is also strongly in fa
vor of the enterprise.
"The project is quite possible," he re
marked. "The benefit to the State and
the entire coast would be great. The more
you bring Eastern people in contact with
California and her varied resources the
more they understand and appreciate us
and the advantages we have to offer. I
found four years" ago, after the conven
tions had adjourned, that there was quite
a sentiment in favor of coming here,
which would lead me to hope that It is
possible to secure one or both of the con
ventions next year. Time is being ob
literate.l every year, and is. in fact, no
objection .at the present time. I think
there is sufficient hope of success to war
rant an effort being made. I never thought
so before. Heretofore I have always re
garded it as impossible. '
"The eyes of the whole country are
now turned. to San Francisco, probably
to a greater degree than most people
realize. Everybody is talking of San
Francisco as certain of becoming one of
the great commercial centers of the
world. Any one who talked to the peo
ple of the Fast ten years ago and who
has talked to them recently is surprised
at the, sentiment of commercial interest
in San Francisco to-day as compared
with the past. All seem to agree that
nothing can prevent this city from be
coming the great commercial center for
the oriental trade.
"I shall be pleased to render such as
sistance as is in my power to make the
project a success. I think the sending
of a strong, conservative delegation to
represent the city before the national
committees when they meet would do
much to bring about success, but they
should go without so much flourishing of
trumpets as we are in the habit of using.
It is none too early to begin the cam
paign, as I believe the national commit
tees meet some time In December, about
two months from now."
Mayor Pheian promised hearty co
operation in the project. "A movement of
! that kind," he said, "would have my
' strong support. San Francisco Is well
i adapted for convention, purposes. Con-
I ventions are generally held in midsum
mer, and the member! will be able to
work with comfort. I have seen a na
tional convention at Chicago and I know
the discomforts of that place. Our ho
tels and boarding-houses would meet all
requirements, and thÂ» city, by reason of
the conspicuous position it has assumed
during the last two years, would be nat
urally an attraction for strangers to
visit, thus assuring a large convention.
"I venture to say it would be a more
deliberative and dignified body than any
which has assembled in recent years.
"One great advantage to both parties
would be the convention delegates mov
ing across the continent. This would
spread enthusiasm for either cause. They
might come by one route and return by
another. It would be an advantage to
the entire country, no less than to the
West. Some of our statesmen who at
tend conventions ought occasionally to
see the country which they propose to
govern.
"The practical way is to interest the
National Committeemen. The two Na
tional Committeemen from California,
John D. Spreckels of the Republican
Committee and J. J. Dwyer of the Dem
ocratic Committee, should take the in
itiative, and with them I should be
pleased to give my fullest co-operation."
only .12 of an inch of rain had fallen.
Good rains needed.
WILLOWS, Oct. 12.â The weather is
threatening to-day, but there has been no
rain so fur. Heavy rain would damage
some hay, raisins and prunes that are
still out, and would also destroy enormous
amounts of dry feed on the cattle and
sheep ranges.
KESWICK, Oct. There was a good
downpour of rain this afternoon, it being
the first of the season. It promises to
give water enough for the placer miners,
who have long been unable to work
claims. It will also put a stop to forest
fires thai have for the past month been
a great source of danger.
YUBA CITY. Oct. 12.- Showery weather
has prevailed for tin- last two days. The
precipitation for the. storm is .05 of an
inch, and for the season .23 of an Inch.
No damage to dried fruit or raisins or late
summer crops. Fruit harvest about over.
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 12.â The weather
here has been showery all day and even
ing, the fall up to 5 o'clock being .13 of an
Inch, and considerable has since fallen.
Should the weather become cool and clear
with a dry wind the injury to grapes will
be nominal, but continued wet weather
will soon spoil them for table purposes.
Beans and other small products on the
Islands down the river will also be dam
aped if the rain continues. On the other
hand, the showers have cleared the at
mosphere and flushed the sewers and are
therefore welcome.
FRESNO, Oct. 12.â Up to 6 o'clock this
evening .10 of an Inch of rain fell, making
a total of .30 for the season. Some slight
damage was done to the second crop of
raisins.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. Although
nearly .30 of an inch of rain fell in the
city yesterday, the country outside the
city and the adjacent counties received a
much more copious drenching. There
was snow and hall at El Cajon Pass, and
South California Railroad employes re
port a heavy precipitation along their
lines.

DEWEY'S OFFICIAL GREETING
BY THE STATE OF VERMONT
DEWEY HOMESTEAD, MONTPELIER, VT.
The cross under the window marks the room in which the admiral was born,
W
MONTPELIER, Vt., Oct. 12.â
State of Vermont gave welcome
to Admiral Dewey to-day with a
parade and a reception at the
State House. Tho weather was
perfect, and 30,000 visitors joined
with the hero's townsmen in the cele
bration. .Never before has there been
such a massing of people and so elabor
ate a demonstration in the history of
Vermont. The town was handsomely
decorated.
â  Admiral Dewey spent the night on
board the sleeping-car Geneva, and the
car and the railroad yard were picketed
by ' National Guardsmen. Early this
morning, on a train from Northfield,
came the battalion of cadets from Nor
wich University, the military school
which Admiral Dewey attended when a
youth. The cadets brought two field
pieces to be used in firing salutes.
The admiral was up betimes, although
only a few persons saw him until shortly
after 8 o'clock, when he left his car
and walked to the office of his brother
Charles. He spent a few minutes there
and then returned to the car. Old
friends and neighbors were received by
him during most of the forenoon. A
delegation of King's Daughteas brought
him a large bouquet of roses. Shortly
before noon he went to the residence of
his brother, where a family gathering
was held and luncheon was served. The
occasion was a very happy one, as there
were quite a number of the admiral's
relatives present.
The celebration began at S o'clock with
the firing of an admiral's salute by the
Norwich Cadets. Then a band concert
took place. At noon the Governor's sa
lute was fired, and Immediately after
ward the column for the parade was
formed. ... _ . .
At 1 o'clock the admiral returned to the
car and In a few moments received a
special committee from the State, who
informed the distinguished guest that
they had come to take him in charge
for the remainder of the day. Soon
afterward, in a closed carriage, the
admiral accompanied them to the execu
tive mansion, where he was formally
presented to Governor Smith and Mayor
Senter. Lieutenant Brumby, flag lieu
tenant, accompanied the admiral.
ALASKAN DISPUTE
BUT OF THE WAY
Temporary Agreement
Reached. ,
Special DisiÂ»atcÃ to The Call.
LONDON. Oct. 12.â Sir Louis Henry
Davies, Canadian Minister of Marine and
1 Fisheries, informs the Associated Press
that he has given Canada's consent to a
temporary arrangement of the Alaskan
dispute. This has practically settled tho
whole matter for the time being, as the
main features of the arrangement were
originally suggested by the United States.
- Colonel John Hay. the American Secre
tary of State, will sign the last papers
within a few 'lays and Reginald Tower,
British Charge d'Affaires in Washington,
will ratify on behalf of Great Britain.
Sir Louis Davies said this evening:
"The terms agreed upon are simply a
line drawn across Chl.kat Pass, delimin
ated by the river and mountain top*. It
has absolutely no significance except that
I we hope thereby to avert local friction.
Of course an arrival at even a temporary
agreement is satisfactory. So far as the
original contention is concerned we are
just as misty as ever. I see no signs of
reaching an immediate settlement.
"Canada relinquishes no claim by her
assent to this temporary arrangement
and she has not the slightest intention
of allowing her original contention to
lapse to obscurity. '
"It is not our purpose to permit this
new understanding to extend a day longer
than is necessary. The fact that I am
returning to Canada must not be taken
to indicate that a settlement will be
reached by the date of my leaving Eng
land. My return Is necessitated by mat
ters altogether outside the Alaskan affair.
"I am, however, working in conjunction
with the Colonial Office upon the case. It
will not come before the Joint High Com
mission unless a diplomatic settlement is
previously attained."

Samoan Correspondence Issued.
LONDON. Oct. 12.â Foreign Office
has issued the correspondence which
passed between it and C. N. E. Eliot,
British commissioner to the Samoan con
ference, regarding Samoa and the report
of the joint commissioners of July 18,
inclosing a draft of the amended act for
Dewey there donned his uniform of full
admiral of the navy and then with the
State and city committees entered a lan
dau and through long lines of cheering
people was driven to the foot of State
street, where a column of about 500 men
was awaiting to participate in the parade.
The Norwich University Cadets formed
a personal guard about Admiral Dewey's
carriage.
. The parade began at 2:30 and the route,
nearly three miles in length, lay through
streets lined with bunting and flags. The
cheering was continuous and the admiral
was kept busy during the entire time in
returning greetings.
Before the marchers reached the Capi
tol grounds the admiral's party left the
carriages and ascended the State House
reviewing stand. The procession con
tinued through the main streets and up
through the Capitol grounds, salutes be
ing given as each company passed the
admiral.
A separate stand had been erected be
side the one on which the admiral stood
and on this were over 200 members of the
State and city reception committee. On
the lawn in front a thousand spectators
were massed, with as many more at the
foot of the slope and across the street.
The parade was completed at 4 o'clock
and when quietness had been restored
Governor Smith, turning to Admiral
Dewey, extended to him the welcome of
the State of Vermont, at the same time
presenting to him the medal which the
State had enacted should be given him
as a memorial. Then the Mayor offered
the welcome of the city and the formal
exercises were at an end.
The admiral was escorted back to his
car after a short reception at the State
House.
The day wound up with a gorgeous dis
play of fireworks on the ground behind
the Dewey cottage and an immense bon
fire on Capitol Hill. It is claimed that
the fire was the largest ever constructed
in the country. The fire was on the top
of the hill, which rises abruptly from the
main street, nearly 300 feet above the
Winooski River, and , seventy-five feet
above and directly behind the Capitol
dome. There were used in the construction
of the pile 1000 barrels, 700. railroad ties
the lumber from two buildings and an im
mense quantity of other combustibles.
The expense of the fire was borne by the
State and city. The pile had been guard
ed night and day since completion, and
the government of the islands. Included
in the correspondence is a communication
to Mr. Eliot, dated April 13, in which
Lord Salisbury reviews recent events and
announces his appointment on the com
mission and a note from Mr. Eliot under
date of July 26, giving to Lord Salisbury
a brief narrative of the proceedings o"f
the commission.

to-day many barrels of oil and tar were

rocket. The fire was set at 9 o'clock, and
the flames shot 100 feet Into the air, light
ing up the country for miles around, the
glare being seen thirty miles away. The
pile burned until long after midnight.
The jewel presented to Admiral Dewey
by the State of Vermont is of beautiful

CHARGED WITH SLANDER
BY A NEW YORK MAN
Ex-Chief Justice Vincent of the New

Under Arrest.
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â William G. Vin
cent, a prominent attorney of Chicago
and ex-Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of New Mexico, was arrested to
night in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
charged with slander and defamation of
character. The complainant is Charles G.

It is alleged that Vincent, who had a
quarrel of years' standing with Davis, ap
plied abusive epithets to Davis in the
hotel on Wednesday, and also recom
mended that the clerk of the hotel show-
Davis to the hotel detective. Vincent
gave $1000 cash bail.BOERS DECLARE WAR AND COMMENCE
MOST AGGRESSIVE ACTS:
JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 12.â War was declared
yesterday. The formal declaration occurred at
10 o'clock this rooming.
VRYBURG, Cape Colony, Oct. 12.â A body of
Boers have cut the border fence, advanced to
ti)e railway and cut the telegraph wires. Two
thousand Boers are now occupying the railroad
line.
LONDON. Oct. 13.â When the Cabinet
meets at noon to-day it is evident
the Boer advance will be in full
swing. Judging from present ap
pearances the Boers are preparing
for a simultaneous invasion at five sepa
rate pointsâ Lalngs Neck, Kimberly, Vry
burg, Mafeking and Lobastsi. Therefore.
It is almost impossible to guess the plan
of campaign. A dispatch from Durban,
dated Thursday morning at S o'clock, an
nounces that the Boers seized Albertina
station and demanded the keys, which
were delivered to them by the station
master, who reached Ladysmith on a
trolley car. The excitement at Ladysmith
Is increasing and the troops are ready to
act at a moment's notice.
It is now definitely known that the Brit
ish Government sent no final proposals to
Pretoria. The Transvaal's ultimatum fore
stalled that Intention.
News received thus far shows that
no shot has yet been fired. The evacuated
district between Charlestown and New
castle, Natal, has an area of -â "â¢' 1 square
miles, and consists chiefly of hilly moor
land, sparsely populated.
The Jacobsdal command of the Free
State Boers is marching on the Modder
River.
There is no abatement in the anti-Eng
lish feeling on the Continent. The Times'
Berlin correspondent declares that the
German nation as a whole is unfriendly to
England and that there would be re
joicing on all sides if England should suf
fer disaster, just is the people were
ready to rejoice had America suffered de
feat at the hands of Spain.
Advices from Vienna report that at an
anti-Semitic meeting there Burgomaster
Lueger included both the United States
and England in a charge of ruthlessness
and thirst for gold, especially criticizing
America In her economic dings with
Europe, lierr Lueger. in the course of
his speech, paid homage to the patriotism
and love of liberty displayed by the Boers.
The Daily Mail's correspondent at Lo
bs tsi, telegraphing on Wednesday, says:
"The Boers are on the border preparing
to cross at 3 o'clock to-day. A messenger
sent to the Beors -king them to spare
the women and children has been de
tained.
The home preparations for war are
growing apace. The reservists are re
sponding more actively to the proclama
tion ordering their mobilization and the
Government has engaged more transports.
The morning papers are cussing at
some length the authority of the docu
ments which have recently emanated
from President Kruger's Government. Dr.
Leyds, tho European representative of the
South African Republic, is generally cred-
ited with the authorship of the ultima
tum.
The Daily Mail says: "Certainly neither
President Kruger nor State Secretary
Reitz drafted the message to the New
York World, and it is more probable that
Mr. Smuts (State Attorney) is the author
of this and the ultimatum."
f-*:-bident Kruger is credited with de
clining to quit Pretoria, declaring that,
"like a faithful captain, he will remain on
the bridge whether the ship rides safely
Ino the harbor or goes down into the
â 
Harry Escombe, former Prime Miniser
of Natal, was among the last to leave
Charlestown; He still doubts whether the
Boers will really move, into Natal.
Conyngham Greene, when bidding fare
well to the Transvaai Government, men
tioned the case of the Englishman Rob
ertson, who ls imprisoned at Pretoria on
a charge of aUempting to raise recruits
at Johannesburg for the Natal Light
Horse. His friends re seriously con
cerned for his safety and have appealed
to the American Consul on his Desalt.
NON-COMBATANTS
MUST LEAVE MAFEKING
MAFEKING. Cape Colony. Oct. 13.â As
Colonel Baden-Powell's Movement From Mafeking.
View of Mafeklne and the country east to the Transvaal border, some nine or ten miles distant, across which, near Ottoshoop and Roolgrond, Boers to the number of 3500 are said to be in "laager" prepar
ing for a raid. The troops ln the foreground are Colonel Baden-Powell's forces, which left Mafeking yesterday for a more favorable position nearer the frontier. _he road they are on is the same by which
the Jameson raiders left Mafeking for Johannisburg in J896. The border line runs to the southeast, between the last two hills shown on the right.
| the Boers in strong force threaten this
! place the situation is so serious that all
j non-combatants have been notified that
they will be taken away at the expense
j of the Imperial Government and housed
jat Cape Town. A railroad train carrying
| 300 women and children was escorted by
; a detachment of Colonel Baden-Powell's
I force as far south as Vryburg, where the
Cape railway becomes responsible for the
' safety of the passengers.
LONDON, Oct. 13.â Albertina, which a
dispatch from Durban reported as having
been seized on Thursday h,v the Boers, is
a station in the Free State on the Harri
smith line. Harrlsmith is equipped and
officered entirely by Natal troops. Dur
ban advices received here say that the
Royal Irish Fuslleers have arrived there
and that military headquarters are being
removed to Ladysmith, whither General
Sir George Stewart White. General Sir
Archibald Hunter and General Symonds,
with their staffs, have already gone.
MAFEKING PREPARES
FOR AN ATTACK
CAPE TOWN. Oct. 12.â Advices from
Mafeking say that precaution has been
taken against attack and all the streets
are barricaded. According to these ad
vices the Boers Intend to shell the town
before delivering their attack. They are
said to possess twelve guns. Every man
in Mafeking is carrying a rifle and the
military authorities are confident that
they will be able to repel attack, but they
lack the force necessary to follow a Boer
retreat. The convent sisters and many
ladles have elected to stay and nurse the
wounded and houses have been converted
into hospitals. The searchlight on the
fort ls kept working across the veldt.
Three Boer spies have been arrested In
| the town. Railway communication to
I the southward is practically at the mercy
; of the Boers, over 200 miles of the line
being within easy striking distance of
the enterprising commandos.
Sad scenes occurred at the railway sta
tion on the departure of the women and
children by train. It is thought that even
should the main line be blown up at any
polnt the damage can be repaired within
a few hours.
BADEN-POWELL'S FORCE
TAKES DEFENSIVE GROUND
LONDON. Oct. 12.â A dispatch from
Mafeking under to-day's date says that
Colonel Baden-Powell has just sent a
strong British force from Mafeking to
ward the border with field guns and am
bulances, presumably with a view of oc
cupying advantageous defensive high
ground.
Dispatches from Duban. Natal, confirm
the report that the Orange Free State
authorities seized the Natal train that
was leaving Ladysmith yesterday morn
ing for Harrismith. They also stopped a
train due to leave Harrismith in the aft
ernoon. All the rolling stock has been
ordered down the country out of reach of
seizure.
It is understood that telegraphic com
munication with the Transvaal ceased
punctually at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon (Transvaal time). *

BIG ADVANCE IN
ATLANTIC FREIGHT RATES
NEW YORK, Oct. . 12.â According to
Dcean freight agents in the Produce Ex
change, Atlantic freight rates have ad
vanced on ah average of five shillings a
ton. This Increase is due to the fact that
the English Government has chartered
more than eighty steamers. More than
one-half of these were used In the Atlan
tic trade. Agents say that they will not
know what boats have been taken until
the steamships are ready to leave the
other side. Then they will be notified that
the vessels have been taken. Within the
last few weeks ocean freight rates are
said to have advanced 25 to 30 per cent.
HALIFAX RESERVES
TO GO TO THE CAPE
HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. 12.â The military
authorities here are active in view of the
Transvaal situation. Lord Seymour has
Issued an order for all the reserve men
In and about Halifax to be prepared to
shoulder guns and go to the Cape if neces
sary. To-day the whole reserve force
here was notified of the War Depart
ment's Instructions. The order to the re
serves was that they may be required to
go to the Cape. There are several hun
dred reserves in Halifax.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
SENT FROM MAFEKING
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 12.â At G;10 Wednes
day evening three carriages containing i
women and children, but not a single j
white man except sick ministers, were i
dispatched from Mafeking- The prepara
tions for the defense of Mafeking are ex
cellent. It is reported by natives at Mafe
king that they were robbed of money by
the Boers at Malmani.
The news of the ultimatum created no
excitement ' at Mafeking. A transport
rider suspected of carrying details daily
across the border has been arrested there.
STRICT NEUTRALITY
OF THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, Oct. Although ;
urged to tender the mediation of the !
United States to aid Great Britain in her .
operations against the Boers, and again .
to assist President Kruger's forces ln op- j
posing the British, President McKlnley \
has decided to maintain strict neutrality '
ln the South African war. The official !
announcement of this as the attitude of
the United States was made by the State
Department to-day. This announcement
was undoubtedly prepared by Secretary
Hay after consultation with the President
and his Cabinet, and forwarded to Wash
ington for publication by the State De
partment. Appended is the statement is
sued by the State Department:
The President has received a large number of
petitions signed by many citizens of distinction
requesting him to tender the mediation of the
United States to settle the difficulties existing
between the Government of Great Britain and
that of the Transvaal. He has received other
petitions on the same subject, some of them
desiring him to make common cause with
Great Britain to redress the wrongs alleged to
have been suffered my the Outlanders, and
especially by American citizens tn the Trans
vaal, and others wishing him to assist the
Boers against alleged aggression. It Is under-
Stood that the President does not think it ex
pedient to take action In any of these direc
tions. As to taking sides with either party to
the dispute it is not to be thought of. As to
mediation, the President has received no Inti
mation from either of the countries that the
mediation of the I'-ited States would be ac
cepted, and In the absence of such intimation
from both parties there is nothing In the rules
of international usage to Justtf- an offer of
mediation in the present circumstances. It is
known that the President sincerely hopes and
desires that hostilities may be avoided, but If,
unfortunately, they ...ould come to pass, the
effort of this Government will be directedâ
they are at presentâ to seeing that neither our
national Interests nor those fat our citizens
shall suffer unnecessary Injury.
Formal application that the United
States protect British Interests In the
Transvaal had not been made to the State
ultimatum^'' Â° Ct ' 12 Followln * ,s the text of the British reply to the Boer
"Chamberlain to Milner, High Commissioner, 10-45 p. m
October 10, 1899: '
"Her Majesty's Government has received with great regret the
peremptory demands of the South African republic, conveyed in
your telegram of October 9. You will inform the Government of the
South African republic in reply that the conditions demanded by the
Government of the South African republic are such as her Majesty's
Government deems it impossible to discuss."

REPORTED DESTROYED
Big Loss of Life Will Result, and the
News Is Unofficially Con-
firmed.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 13.â A
dispatch from Vryburg says an
armored train has been de-
stroyed. It is feared that much
loss of life will result. The news
has been unofficially confirmed.
The first shot of war, it is now
admitted, has been fired. Before
Kruger's ultimatum was issued
it came from a Boer patrol, who
fired on the mail train from Na-
tal. The seizure of a mail train
in the Free State at Harrismith
is also reported.

FIFTH FIZZLE IN THE
ATTEMPT TO RACE
So Scarce Is the Wind Off Sandy
Hook That There Is Agitation
to Change the Course.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13. â
Sandy Hook at 2 a. m. reports
thick fog and no wind. The
Weather Bureau predicts light
winds for to-day. The pros
pect of a race to-day is not
good.
NEW YORK. Oct. 12â A blanket of
fog over the course and the utter
absence of wind caused the fifth
successive lizzie when another at
tempt was made -das to sail the
first of the Columbia-Shamrock se
ries for the international trophy. The
yachts will try again to-morrow.
The repeated failures have had a most
discouraging effect on the general pub
lic and there was a great falling off in
the number of excursion boats as well
as the number of their passengers when
the fleet gathered around Sandy Hook
lightship to-day at the time set for the
start. The heavy fog made navigation
not only exceedingly difficult but very
dangerous. The ships of the fleet that
did brave the perils of the fog could only
crawl out to their destination, keening
double lookouts forward and their fog
whistles constantly going to avoid col
lision. At times it was Impossible to see
fifty feet ahead and it was an uncanny
spectacle to have a big, ghost-like hull
loom up close aboard. The mist lay
thickest upon the surface of the water
and on the way down the bay the top
royal yards of several big clippers could
be made out when their hulls were In
visible. The yards seemed to be suspend
ed in midair without support. Down in
the lower bay the fog was not quite so
thick and about 10 o'clock a light land
breeze from the west gave a faint hope
that it would send the fog out to sea and
furnish good racing conditions later on.
So the racing sloops let go of their moor
ings and were towed out to the starting
line. There they got their sails up and
drifted about, rocking in the gentle
ground-swell. But the haze did not lift
and the breeze, instead of increasing,
died away altogether. When the time
came to signal the course the weather
vane at the masthead of the committee
boat, which would respond to the breath
of a sleeping infant, lay limp and life
lees against the staff. Shortly after 12
o'clock, by mutual consent, the commit
tee boat hoisted the letter "R" on the
triatic stay, meaning race is off.
The Bails were lowered and the tenders
of the two yachts took them In tow back
to the Horseshoe, while the excursionists
sailed homeward. Mr. Iselin's interview
in this morning's papers protesting
against the savage criticism of the Co
lumbia, which has been liberally in
dulged in by some of the newspapers
and appealing for the Yankee and her
crew until the race is completed, evi
dently touched a patriotic chord, for on
the way back every excursion steamer In
the fleet sailed alongside and saluted,
while the passengers gave the white
beauty three rousing cheers and a tiger.
The repeated flukes off Sandy Hook
have led to some agitation for a change
of the course to Newport, where there is
usually a breeze, or to Marblehead. of
the Massachusetts coast, where no diffi
culty would l"- experienced in getting
plenty of wind, but it is hardly likely that
any change will be made. The regatta
committee argues that this sort of
weather cannot last at this time of the
year.
The early morning hours at Sandy Hook
Bay gave little promise of a race. The
weather war fairly clear for a few miles
seaward at S o'clock, and there was a
light breeze from a little south of west
but up to the northward, toward the Nar
rows, the fog still hunt, thickly.
Mainsails were hoisted early on both
yachts, and soon after 9 'clock th. cast
off from their moorings and were 'towed
out to Sandy Hook lightship. Club top
sails were mastheaded on he way out
the Columbia setting a smaller one than
was shown on Wednesday afternoon. The
Shamrock's was apparently larger than
any yet seen aloft. It was bent 01 two
light aluminum spars, and its narrow
cloth radiated from a center band like
a jib.
Th- yachts arrived off the lightship at
10:10 a. m. Casting off their towllnes and
breaking out their headsails, they circled
about the lights for an hour 'or so in
the light southwest breeze, waiting for
th.. commit! boat to arrive. The fog
showed a disposition to clear off about
this time, but there was hardly wind
enough to give the yachts steerage way
For an hour after the committee boat ar
rived there was no more wind, and no
prospect of any, so at 12:10 lock after
a consultation between those in charge of
the yachts, both agreed to call the race
off, a gun was fired and the code signal
letter "R" was hoisted, announcing that
fact to the assembled fleet. A few min
utes later, as agreed on a few days ago,
another gun was lined, calling attention
to the signal that the race would be run
Friday. The Manning and other revenue
cutters, the torpedo boat Porter and all
other vessels having the signal letters
hoisted them, so that all the fleet micht
know of the committee's decision before
going back to the city.
The sails of both yachts were taken in
as they were towed back to their moor
ings In the Horseshoe, where they arrived
at 1:30. The same persons were aboard

COMMENT OF TWO
YACHTING PAPERS
LONDON, Oct. 12.â Yachting World
says to-day with reference to the interna

are three points regarding which the mind
of the public is now satisfied. The Co
lumbia is no match for the Shamrock in
light weather; the Americans are stretch
ing somewhat In Sir Thomas Upton's fa
vor in agreeing to race dally, and the
criticism of Captain Barr, the Columbia's
skipper, forms the only jarring note in
what so fir has been a most harmonious
contest, for it is evident that it is no fault
of Barr that the Columbia will not travel.
The Yachtsman, discussing the time

hour, when wind and weather conditions.

AMHEI DESTROYED AND
FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE
KILLED BY AN EARTHQUAKE
AMSTERDAM. Oct. 12.â A dispatch to the Mandelsblad from Batavia. the capital of The Netherlands Indies, Java, says
that a violent earthquake has visited the south side of the island of Ceram, completely destroying the town of Amhel
and killing instantly some 4000 people, as well as injuring some 500 others. The dispatch says details of the disaster
have not yet been obtained.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 12.â of the severest earthquakes ever felt here took place to-night exactly at 9 o'clock, and
following one which occurred at 7 o'clock this morning it created much excitement. A minstrel show, which was in
progress at Athanaeura Hall, was brought to a hurried close and the audience rushed from the building. Chimneys were
thrown down and plaster in many parts of the city was shaken from the laths. A few minutes after two other shocks of a
similar nature, but less severe, followed. The people are much disturbed, as the shake-up was more in the nature of an at
mospheric disturbance than an earthquake, and was not felt In Petaluma, sixteen miles south of here.
This adds 100 men to the strikers. The
company had offered to remedy individual
grievances, but would not recognize the
union.
IDENTITY OF BANK
ROBBER PARTLY CLEARED
Believed to Have Been Dr. Lewis, a
Young Man Who Once Held
High Place.
CHICAGO. Oct. 12.â The mystery as to
the identity of the man who tried to rob
Charles H. Patten's bank in Palatine
September 21, and who was mortally
wounded in the attempt, was, it is
thought, cleared up to-day by one who
believes himself to be a brother of the
dead man, and by C. A. Partridge of
Waukeegan, adjutant general of the Ill
inois department of the G. A. R. Both
are positive that the man who lost his life
while in the commission of a crime and
who now lies in a nameless grave in the
potters field was Dr. William L. Lewis,
a graduate of two medical colleges; a li
censed physician, and a man who was
driven to the deed by the excessive use
of morphine.
Dr. Lewis was 2C years old and lived
most of his life in Wisconsin. He trav
eled extensively, and it was considered
had a brilliant future before him. His
linen was marked with the initials W. L.,
and after being wounded he gave his
name as Walter Lawton, admitting the
name was assumed. He refused to the
last to disclose his identity, saying that
he did not care to have his relatives in
New York know anything of the disgrace
he had brought upon them.
After being wounded he showed much
knowledge of surgery, engaging at one
time in an argument with the physicians
as to whether he was bleeding internally.
Something over two years ago he was
seized with pneumonia, and, opium being
used as a medicine, he became a victim
of the drug. It is believed by his rela
tives that he was in an unbalanced men
tal condition when he attacked the bank.
The fact that Dr. Lewis, who had been
living at the Palmer House ln this city,
has never been seen or heard from since
the day of the episode at Palatine, to
gether with the marking of "Lawton's"
linen, first brought his family to the be
lief that the men were identical. The
body will be exhumed for identification.

PEARL HART
ESCAPES FROM
PRISON CELL
Famous Woman Bandit and
Stage Robber Once More
at Liberty.-
HELPED BY A MAN
She and Her Accomplice Are Now
Thought to Be Safe Across
the Mexican Border.
Special . Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 12â The latest and
probably the final act, so far as the
public will ever know, in the dramatic
career of the famous woman bandit,
Pearl Hart, occurred this morning be
tween midnight and daylight. Some time
between those hours she succeeded in
making her escape from the county jail
in this city.
Several months ago this woman, with
a male companion, held up and robbed
a stage in the mountains in the central
part of the Territory. With several
hundred dollars in cash and considerable
jewelry, as the booty of the hold up, the
pair journeyed across the mountains and
desert ln vain attempt to reach the rail
road in the southern part of the Terri
tory. When within one day's journey of
Benson, on the Southern Pacific, they
were discovered and arrested. The
woman took the entire responsibility for
the robbery and gave as the reason her
desire to reach her mother, who she
had heard was dying in Cleveland, Ohio,
With her unsavory reputation she had
been unable to borrow the money or ob
tain it in any other way.
In order to secure fitting accommoda
tions. Miss Hart was soon removed from
Florence to this city ami lodged in a
comfortable room on the second floor of
the county jail, far removed from the
other prisoners. Her absolutely unique ca
reer has attracted widespread attention
and there has been much public interest
manifested in her case. Some weeks ago
an unknown man was lodged in jail on a
charge of drunkenness. After his release
he was soon recommitted on a sixty-day
sentence for the same offense. By his
good conduct he secured the confidence
of the officers and was permitted many
liberties. These he used profitably In
planning the successful escape of Pearl
Hart. Yesterday he easily left the jail
unnoticed, as he was permitted to go
around the building and yard. During
the night he returned to the courthouse,
adjoining the jail, made his way to the
staircase leading to the tower of the
courthouse and, passing under the roof,
reached a point nearly on a level with
the celling of the room occupied by Pearl '
Hart. At this point only plaster and
lathing formed the wall and soon a hole
a foot square was cut through. Miss
Hart arranged a sheet to catch the falling
plaster to avoid the noise and then piled
up her furniture to enable her to climb
out. It is not known in what direction
the fugitives went, but they are supposed
to be safely across the Mexican border.
Miss Hart frequently boasted that she
would not come to trial on a charge of
violating a law in which she, as a woman,
had no voice in making.
FOR THE BETTERMENT
OF THE LOWLY RED
Mohonk Conference Favors the Tak
ing of the Indian Service
Out of Politics.
MOHONK LAKE, N. V., Oct. 12.â The
Mohonk Indian conference to-day re
ceived the report of the committee ap
pointed last year to recommend a scheme
adapted to carry into effect the views
expressed tn the platform of last year's
conference. The report disavows any
purpose of personal attack upon the pres
ent administration of Indian affairs. It
declares that the Indian service should
be taken out of politics; that the commis
sion should not be regarded as a politi
cal office; expresses confidence in the
present Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs; advises
that the present system should be re
garded as temporary, to be simplified, so
far as possible, and that such a policy
should be adopted as will tend toward Its
gradual abandonment. Several methods
which have been suggested with this end
in view are discussed without approval.
Finally It was recommended that the
agencies should be discontinued as fast
as it becomes practicable in each case.
Several agencies were mentioned which
in the opinion of the commission might
soon be abolished. The supply of rations
and payment of annuities should also be
discontinued as soon as possible. The
agents should be Included in the classi
fied service. The report was discussed
at length by the conference and with
most amendments unanimously adopted.
Addresses from Dr. Flssel of the Hamp
ton Institute and Dr. Slocum, president
of the Colorado College, received close
attention.

Sixth Round.

Athletic Club to-night "Spike" Sullivan
of Ireland knocked out Jimmy Murray of
Cincinnati In the sixth round of what was
to have been a twenty-five-round bout, at
133 pounds, before a crowd of 3000 specta
tors. Murray had been heralded as a
wonder from the West and was expected
to give the Irishman a hard run. Sullivan
was at no time in danger, but took no
chances, and wore his man down with
body blows until he was able to send over
a swing to a vital spot. He wasted no
time in preliminary sparring, but went
right to his man and forced him about
the ring with left jabs to the face and
left and right to the body. ,_ -,.-' 'â â¢.
Murray opened the second round with a
straight left to the face and ducked a
dangerous right-hand swing, sending
rights twice to Spike's jaw. Spike con
tinued his play on the body, and, suddenly
shifting, sent Murray to the floor with a
left swing on the jaw. Murray was on
his feet in time, but stood away for the
rest of the round. The following two
rounds were all Sullivan's, and in the fifth
he brought down Murray's guard with left
and right to the body and swung his
right 'to the jaw. sending the stern
man to the- floor. Murray was weak when
he regained his feet, and Spike sent him
down again with a right swing on the
chest. Murray regained his feet just as
the bell rang.
Murray was very weak when he came
up for the sixth, and Spike forced him
about the ring with left and right swings
to the head. Twice he went down from
right swings on the jaw. but each time
struggled gamely to his feet. After get
ting to his feet the second time Spike
swung his left to the chin and Murray
went down and out. Time of round, two
minutes and twenty-two seconds.

CUBAN SUGAR NEEDED.
Havana Paper on the United States
Market Outlook.
HAVANA, Oct. 12.â Patrla says to
day:
There is no need to fear that the United
States can get all the sugar needed by the
Americans from the American sugar islands.
The most that Porto Rico can produce is 100
--000 tons. Hawaii could not produce 450,000 tons.
The Philippines are as yet unconquered. and,
moreover, they are twenty-five days distant.
Hawaii, counting the freight by sea to San
Francisco and the railroad freight to the East
ern coast, could not compete in the Eastern
States with Cuban sugar, which takes only
five days to reach New York.
The annual consumption of sugar in the
United States is not less than 2,000,000 tons, and
it is steadily increasing. If we take away the
550,000 tons supplied by Hawaii and Porto Rico
there is a balance of about 1,500,000 tons to be
obtained from Louisiana and the Philippines.
Louisiana suppplles only 250,000 tons, which she
will not be able to increase on account of the
lowering in prices caused by allowing Hawaii
and the Philippine sugar to enter the United
I States. The Americans, therefore, will be
compelled to apply to Cuba.

FAVOR TEACHING
OF THE CLASSICS
Archbishops Again Ap
peal to the Pope.
Special Dispatch to The Call. *Â».
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING* ;
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Oct. 12.â'
! Pope Leo XIII is to be again petitioned
I by' the archbishops of the Amerlcai
! church to allow Christian Brothers to re
-1 sume the teaching of classics in the
! schools in this country. This was the im-
I portant subject under consideration by
j the archbishops in their meeting to-day â 
!at the Catholic University. There were
i present Cardinal Gibbons and Arch-
I bishops Williams of Boston, Corrigan of
i New York, Rvan of Philadelphia, Elder
j of Cincinnati, Ireland of St. Paul, Christie
of Oregon, Matz of Milwaukee, Riordan,
; of San Francisco, Bourgade of Santa Fa
; and Kain of St. Louis, the latter being
I secretary of the board.
The prelates, after a long debate, con
| eluded to reaffirm the petition sent to
Rome last year regarding the status of
the Christian Brothers in this country.
Archbishop Riordan, who is going to
Rome to make his visit ad limina. was
appointed representative of the American
hierarchy and was instructed to ask for
a perpetual dispensation for the brother
i hood to teach classics in their American
schools.
It is also proposed to plead especially
the cause of those brothers who have
been sent into exile becauss they have
carried .out the wishes of the American
archbishops. There are now twelve of
these, prominent among whom are Broth
ers Paulian and Justin of New York,
well-known educators; Brother Maurellan
of Nashville and Brother Fabrician, for
mer head of the college in this city. All
of these men were conspicuous in the

GIVEN A WELCOME
BY THE PRESIDENT
Mr. McKinley Reviews the Thir
teenth Regiment and Warmly
Praises the Volunteers.
MINNEAPOLIS. Oct. 12.â From a plat
form in front of the Minneapolis Exposi
tion building President McKinley this aft
ernoon voiced the nation's welcome to the
Thirteenth. Minnesota Volunteers, just re
turned from the Philippines, and delivered
an address to thousands of cheering peo
ple.
The President and his party were driven
to the exposition building directly after
having viewed the long parade from the
reviewing stand on Nicollet avenue. About
the platform in front of the building,
where General Harrison was nominated
for President of the United States by c
convention presided over by William Mc
kinley, were massed the returned volun
teers. Behind them was a crowd whose
numbers could scarcely be estimated. The
cheering broke loose as soon as President
McKinley, Governor Lind and General
Summers of the Second Oregon Volun
teers appeared on the platform. Dr.
Cyrus Northrup, president of the Univer
sity of Minnesota, presided over the exer
cises and the invocation was pronounced
by Bishop Isaac W. Joyce of the Metho
dist Episcopal church.
Mayor day spoke the words of greet
ing to the soldiers and distinguished
guests on behalf of the city, and Governor
land on behalf of the State. The Gover
nor paid a strong tribute to tho returned
volunteers.
President McKinley was greeted with
cheers that continued for several minutes,
and throughout the delivery of the ad
dress the applause was frequet. Said he:
I have come from the capital of the nation
that 1 might give the nation's welcome to a
regiment of the nation's fenders. I have
. come to speak the voice of love and gratitude
which comes from every American heart to-day
thai loves the tlag. I have come to hid you
welcome because you did your duty, ami that
1b the highest tribute that can be paid to any
foldler anywhere; and I do not think the mem
bers of this regiment, or the regiments consti
tuting the Eighth Army Corps in the Philip
pines, realize the Importance and heroism of
their action niter the treaty of peace was
signed and ratified 1 want to say to you men,
and to Colonel Summersâ General Somers now,
because of his gallantryâ that the officers and
men of the Eighth Army Corps sent to Wash
ington a message t. ...ng me that they would
stay in the Philippines until I could create a
new army and send it there to take their
places. . . ._
1 come to bid you welcome and give you the
honor of the nation because you sustained the
tlag of the nation, because you refused to stack
arms, refused to sound retreat. And you have
come back, having a high place In the hearts
and affections of the American people and grat
itude that will continue for all time. You have
also by your services added much to th. cause
of huma'nitv, added much to the advancement
of the civilization which has so characterized
the century just now fading away. This cen
tury heralds the most wonderful progress of
the world known to all history.
The century now drawing to a close has been
most memorable in the world's progress and
history. The march of manking in moral and
intellectual advancement has been onward and
upward. The growth of the world's material
Interests is so ast that the figures would al
most seem to be drawn from the realm of im
agination rather than from the field of fact.
All peoples have felt the elevating influences
of the century. Humanity and home have been
lifted up. Nations have been drawn closer to
gether In feeling and interest and sen
timent. Contact has removed old prejudices at
home and abroad, and brought about a bettor
understanding which has destroyed enmity and
prompted amity. Civilization has achieved
great victories and to the gospel of good will
there are now few dissenters. The great pow
ers under the inspiration of the Czar of Rus
sia have been sluing together in a parliament
of peace seeking to find a common basis for the
adjustment of controversies without war and
I waste. While they have not made war Impos
sible, they have made peace more probable and
have emphasized the -....,: love of peace.
They have made a gain for the world's repose;
und Americans, while rejoicing In what was
accomplished, rejoice also for their participa
tion ln the great cause yet to be advanced, we
trust, to more perfect fulfillment.
The century has blessed us as a nation. While
it has not given us perfect peace, it has brought
us constant and ever-increasing blessings and
Imposes upon us no humiliation or dishonor.
We have had wars with foreign powers and
the unhappy one nt homeâ but all terminated
ln no loss of prestige or honor or territory, but
a gain in all.
The increase of our territory has added vastly
to our strength and prosperity without chang
ing our Republican character. li has given
wider scope to democratic principles and en
larged the area for republican Institutions.
I sometimes think we do not realize what we
have, and the mighty trust we have committed
Ito our keeping. The study of ipraphy and
history have now more than a passing interest
to the American people. It Is worth reading
that when the Federal Cnion was formed we
held 909,760 square miles of territory and in less
than 100 years we have grown to 3,845,513 square
miles.
The first acquisition. In 18 3. known as the
â¢'Louisiana purchase." embraced 8^3,072 square
miles, exclusive of the area west of the Rocky
Mountains. Its vastness and value will best be
understood wh.cn I say that It comprises the
entire States of Arkansas, Mississippi, lowa,
Nebraska. North and South Dakota and parts
of the States of Minnesota. Kan. Colorado,
Montana, Wyoming, Louisiana, all of Indian
Territory and .urt of Oklahoma. It would
fcfm almost incredible to the present genera
tion that this rich addition to the Federal do
main should have been opposed, and yet It was
resisted In every form and by every kind of
ass_ult. The ceded territory was characterized
aÂ« a "malarial swamp." its prairies destitute
of trees or vegetation. It was commonly
charged that we had been cheated by giving
J15.000.000 for a territory so worthless and pesti
lential that it could never be Inhabited or put
to use, and it was also . a ely asserted that
the purchise would lead to ci replications and
wars with European powers. Iji the debate in
the Senate over the treaty a distinguished Sen
ator from Connecticut said:
"The vast and unmanageable estate which the
lyoulsiana acquisition will give the United
States, the consequent dispersion .' our popu
lation and the destruction of that balance
which It is so Important to maintain between
the Eastern and Western States, threatens at

no very distant day the subversion of our
Union."
A distinguished Senator from Delaware said:
"But as to Louisiana, this new. Immense,
unbounded worldâ lf it should ever be incorpo
rated into the Union, of which I have no Idea,
and which can only be done by amending the
constitution. I believe it will be the greatest
curse that could at present befall us. It may
be productive of Innumerable evils, and espe
cially of one that I lear to ever look upon.
Thus our citizens will be removed to the im
mense distance of two or three thousand miles
from the capital of the Union, where they will
scarcely ever feel the rays of the genera] Gov
ernment, their affections will be alienated, they
will gradually begin to view us as strangers,
they will form other commercial connections
and our Interest will become distinct * * â¢
and I do say that under existing circumstances,
even supposing that this extent of territory was
a desirable acquisition, fifteen millions of dol
lars was a most enormous sum to give."
A distinguished representative from Virginia
said:
"I fear the effect of the vast extent of our
empire." He feared the effects of the Increased
value of labor, the decrease In the value of
lands and the influence of climate upon our
citizens who should migrate thither. "I fear
(though this land was represented as flowing
with milk and honey) that this Eden of the
new world will prove a cemetery for the bodies
of our citizens."
Imperialism had a chief place ln the cata
logue of disasters which would follow the rati
fication of this treaty, and It was alleged that
it was the first and sure step to the creation
of an empire and the subversion of the con
stitution. The phrase which is now employed
by some critics, "planetary" policy," so far as
I have been able to discover, first appeared
here. Jefferson was made the subject of satiri
cal verse:
"See him commence, land speculator.
And buy up the realm of nature,
Towns, cities, Indians, Spaniards, prairies."
The opponents, however, were in the minority
and the star of the republic did not set, and
the mighty West was brought under the flag
of justice, freedom and opportunity.
In 1819 we added 68,749 square miles, which
now comprises Florida and all parts of Ala
bama, Louisiana and Mississippi. In 1846 we
received the cession of Texas. It contained
376.931 square miles and embraced the State of
Texas and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Col
orado, Wyoming and New Mexico. The next
cession was under the treaty of IS4B, contain
ing 622,568 square miles, embracing the States
of California, Nevada, Utah and parts of Col
orado and Wyoming and of. the Territories of
Arizona and New Mexico.
In 1853 we acquired by the Gadsden purchase
45,535 square miles, which embrace parts of
Louisiana and New Mexico.
The next great acquisition was that of
Alaska in 1667, containing 699,446 square miles.
This treaty, like that of the "Louisiana pur
chase," was fiercely resisted. When the House
had under consideration the bill appropriating
the sum of $7,200,000, the amount of purchase
money for Alaska agreed upon by the treaty,
the minority report on that bill quoted ap
provingly an article which characterized Alaska
as a "terra incognita," and "that persons well
informed as to Alaska are ungrateful er.ough
to hint that we could have bought a much su
perior elephant ln Slam or Bombay for one
hundredth part of the money, with not a ten
thousandth part of expense incurred in keeping
the animal in proper condition."
The minority report proceeded to say that
"the committee having considered various ques
tions involved and the evidence In regard to
the country under consideration, are forced to
the conclusion that the possession of the coun
try is of no value to the Government of the
United States; that it will be a source of weak
ness Instead of power, and a constant annual
expense, for which there will be no adequate
return; that it has no capacity as an agri
cultural country; that it is known that it has
no value as a mineral country; that its trade
is of insignificant value to us as a nation and
will speedily come to an ned; that the fisheries
are of doubtful value and that whatever the
value of its fisheries, its fur trade. Its timber
and its minerals, they were all open to the
citizens of the United States under existing
treaties; that the right to govern the nation or
nations of savages in a climate unlit for the
habitation of civilized men was not worthy of
purchase." They therefore reported the follow
ing resolution:
"Resolved, That It is inexpedient to appro
priate money for the purchase of Russian
America."
In the debate in the House a distinguished
Representative from Massachusetts said:
"If we are to pay for Russia friendship this
amount, 1 desire to give her the {7,200,000 and
let her keep Alaska. 1 have no doubt that at
any time within the last twenty year., we could
have had Alaska for the asking, providing we
would have taken it as a gift, but no man, ex
cept one insane enough to buy the earthquakes
of St. Thomas and the ice fields of Greenland,
could be found to agree to any other terms for
its acquisition to this country."
To this treaty the opponents were in the
minority and that great, rich territory, from
which we have drawn many and many times
over Its purchase price, and with phenomenal
wealth yet undeveloped, is ours in spite of their
Dpposltion.
In the last year we have added to the terri
tory of the United States the territory of the
Hawaiian [stands, one of the gems of the Pa
cific Ocean, containing 6724 square miles; Porto
Rico, containing 3600 square miles; Guam, con
taining fifty square miles, and the Philippine
archipelago, embracing approximately 143,000
square miles. This latest acquisition is about
one-sixth the size of the original thirteen
States. This is larger than the combined area
of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina and the District
of Columbia. It equals in area all of the New
England States. It is almost as large as
Washington and Oregon combined and greater
than Ohio, Indiana and Illinois united. Three
times larger than New York, and three and
a half times larger than the State of Ohio.
The treaty of peace with Spain, which gave '
us the Philippines, Porto Rico and Guam, met j
with some opposition in the Senate, but was j
ratified by that body by more than a two-thirds
vote; while in the House the appropriation of
$20,000,000 was made with little or no opposition^
As in the case of the Louisiana purchase and
Alaska, the opponents of the treaty were In tha
minority and the star of hope to an oppressed
people was not extinguished.
The future of these new possessions Is in the
keeping of Congress, and Congress Is the serv
ant of the people. That they will be retained
under the benign sovereignty of the United
States I do not permit myself to doubt. That
they will prove a rich and invaluable heritage
I feel assured. That Congress will provide for
them a government which will bring them
blessings, which will promote their material
Interests as well as advance their people In the
path Of civilization and Intelligence, I confi
dently believe. They will not be governed as
vassals or serfs or slavesâ they will be given a
government of liberty, regulated by law, hon
estly administered, without oppressing or ex
acting, taxation without tyranny. Justice with
out bribe, education without distinction of so
cial conditions, freedom of religious worship
and protection in life, liberty and the pursuit
â¢>'. happiness. >
Attorney General Griggs was. next in
troduced. In a brief address he praised
the volunteers for their gallantry in ac
tion and complimented them on their good
appearance.
Secretary Long of the Navy was the
closing speaker. B_t_B
"I am one with you." said Secretary
Long, "in love and admiration for the
President of the United States, who
stands before you, the representative of
that great country whose citizens you are.
I am one with you also in your love
for your own great State. And I
am one with you In your appre
ciation cf tho navy of the United
States. I thrill through and through in
admiration for its achievements. I recall
the fall of Santiago before the guns of
Sampsonâ"
At this point hundreds of voices in the
crowd interrupted the Secretary's re
marks with shouts of "Schley! Schley!
Schley!" The Secretary paused a mo
ment and then said:
"Mv friends, there is glory enough for
all. If I were to attempt to enumerate
the names of all these who took part in
the great naval achievements you .would
never have your dinner before I had con
cluded."
General Summers, responding to calls of
the soldier boys, came forward and bowed
his acknowledgments amid frantic cheers.
"We left Old Glory floating in Luzon,"
he said, "and if necessary we will go back
there to defend it."
At the conclusion of the exercises the
returned volunteers were served with an
elaborate dinner In the exposition build
ing. The Presidential party was driven to
the residence of Thomas Lowrey for din
ner and at 6 o'clock was conveyed to St.
Paul on the interurban trolley line.

Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Oct. General Schwan's
expedition having accomplished its ob
ject, the troops are all returning to their
former positions, abandoning the towns
taken. General Schwan is en route from
Perez de Marinas to Imus, with the in
fantry, while the artillery and cavalry
and all mule teams are retracing their
route from Malabon to Bacoor, with the
signal corps removing the wires. General
Trias, with the organized bodies of insur
gents, retreated to Silang and Indang, at
the base of the mountain.
The movement of United States troops
was a fine display of American general
ship and energy, while the Filipinos made
what General Alejandro terms "our pe
culiar method of warfare."
The whole country is an immense
swamp, and the Filipinos never expected
that the Americans could or would at- |
tempt to invade it during the wet season. j
Moreover, the line of march furnished a
succession of surprises, the advancing !
troops being generally attacked from the j
unexpected points.
In Cavite province, the scene of the hot- j
test fights and their greatest successes
over the Spaniards, the Filipinos might
have been expected to make a resolute â¢
stand, if anywhere, but after their whip
pings at Cavite, Vicjo and Noveleta their
tactics consisted chiefly in a continuous |
exhibition of their agility and their trans- j
formation from warriors to amigos.
The marines, while reconnoltering about |
the scene of Sunday's encounter. find ,
that the trenches have been already re- ,
occupied, although the enemy manifested j
more than their usual willingness to re
treat before the Americans. Bands have j
appeared along the shore road between j
Bacoor and Rosario and the troops re- !
turning by that route expect another |
light at Rosario. At Malabon the Ameri- j
cans corralled two or three hundred na- ;
fives supposed to be lighting men. A few
of them were caught with arms in their |
hands, but large numbers were found in
hiding, dressed in khaki like the Ameri
can uniforms. A majority of them were
in the garb of amigos, but they are sus
pected of shooting at the troops from
houses, a growing habit, which flourished
throughout the advance whenever small
parties of Americans strayed from the
main body. Â'.
The prisoners are a white elephant on j
the hands of the Americans. The Mala- j
bon contingent spent an unhappy night
incarcerated in a church. A native priest
and an uncle of General Trias were dis- j
covered in the Filipino arsenal outside
the town. They are credited with being
two of the pillars of the insurrection, but j
they vigorously proclaim their innocence. I
The leading citizens of Rosario are ter- ]
porarily engaged in towing a fleet of
cascoes laden with .the American army's :
impedimenta at Bac'oor.
The prisoners, with the exception of |
those caught red-handed, will be released, I
as owing to the fact that the insurgents
have so many more men than guns the
keeping of prisoners Is a useless expense |
unless the policy of reconcentration which !
General Weyler pursued is to be adopted, j
In conversation with an Associated Press
representative a hading merchant of
Rosario remarked: j
"They will all be engaged in their old
business as soon as: released."
When asked where! the army had gone,
the merchant replied:
"The majority of them are here. They
simply hide their guns when they see a
superior force approaching."
The lighting falls the hardest on the
women and children. Hundreds of them |
spent the night before the Americans j
reached Rosario in boats, the bay for |
miles being crowded with small craft ,
containing non-combatants, few of whom j
remained in the town.
The work of commissary and quarter
masters" departments, directed by Cap- I
tains Riddle and Horton, was remarkable
throughout. The transportation of sup- j
plies from Rosario to Malabon seemed to j
be Impossible. The wagons had to be re
peatedly unloaded and reloaded while be
ing dragged through the mire.
General Schwan is marching back with
out the teams, all the loads of baggage
being shipped from Bacoor by cascoes and
the wagons going empty.
A telegraph squad under Lieutenant
Clark kept th" wire abreast of the line to
Malabon, but in order to do this the teams
had to be abandoned and the wire carried
by coolies.

WILLIAM L. WILSON
NEARING HIS GRAVE
Former Postmaster General Is Dying,
Hated by the Members of
His Party.
BY O'BRIEN MOORE.
f EX-POSTMASTER GENERAL WILLIAM L. WILSON. 4
WORD comes from the bleak |
hamlet of Martinsburg, W.
Va., that William Lyne Wil
son is dying. Mr. Wilson does
not live at Martinsburg; his
home is at Charles Town, fif
teen miles away, near the northern mouth
of the famous Shenandoah Valley. There
are two towns in West Virginia that
are eternally conflicting. One is Charles
ton, the State capital, situate on the
Kanawha, not far from Kentucky and
Ohio, and with a population Hearing 20,
--000. The other is Charles Town, popula
tion 3000, not far from Harpers Ferry.
and almost within hailing distance of
Washington. Charles Town is aristo
cratic and discontented and only enjoys
life by sneering at Charleston. It is a
popular fallacy that every adult residing
in Charles Town can write a magazine
article and habitually does. Charles
Town has a sign out that it has reached
the limit of Its growth and ambition and
that new settlers are not wanted.
Charles Town was cut off from Virginia
when West Virginia was made a State,
and consequently the town has since been
discontented. All the people of Charles
Town are society people; but they only
hold social relations with Virginians;
there is not a West Virginian outside of
Charles Town on their visiting lists; and
no Charles Town people who are not dis
contented because they are geograph
ically West Virginians instead of Vir
ginians.
â¢ * â¢
In Charles Town, with its peculiar en
vironment, prejudices and conditions, was
born and has lived William L. Wilson.
In years Wilson Is about midway between
his fifth and sixth decade. He served in
the Confederate Army during the last
year and a half of the Civil War. Often
has he shown me a little tin-type picture
of himself in Confederate gray, standing
at attention with his gun at the "pre
sent." He did not look robust ln the
picture, and as a matter of fact he never
has been robust. Wilson Is not of the
chivalry of Virginiaâ he springs from the
school-teaching class.
Wilson is a lovable man. Nearly
every one who has had opportunity to be
come acquainted with him has liked him.
He is not warm, nor spontaneous, nor is
He endowed with many of the other
traits that make Virginians so attractive.
But there is a simpleness in him, and
his conversation, while by no means
glittering with wit, is so delightful and
pure that no one who has ever heard
film talk missed an opportunity to hear
him again.
â¢ â¢ *
Wilson's rise in West Virginia was
slow and progressive, and his fall was
sharp and violent. He was the best
loved man in his Stateâ in fact, was
described by common consent as "the
first citizen of the commonwealth." Then
the fatal "curse of Cleveland" fell on
him, and West Virginians derided and
despised him instead of honoring him.
He was called upon in a political emerg
ency to choose "between the people who
loved him and had honored him, and the
President of the United States, who had
made him a member of his official family."
He decided to stand by the President,
and his party in West Virginia turned
on him with such fierce hate that for
a couple of years he deemed It prudent

Wilson was elected to Congress from
the Second District of West Virginia for
six consecutive termsâ twelve years. He
was picked up accidentally. He was the
president of the University of West Vir
ginia, located at Morgantown. .A Demo
cratic Congressional Convention was in
session there and became -deadlocked.
There was balloting for more . than â¢ a
Week, three favorite sons being in the
race. At last the convention broke up in
a row and the three men who were before
the convention became candidates before
the people. The Republicans were united
and it became plain to the Democrats
that they would have to unite or lose
the district. A new convention was called,
the favorite sons stood aside and Wil
son, considered; inoffensive and not of
much account and likely not to be long
In anybody's way, was nominated. Ho
was elected and did not attract much
attention during his first term.
He did, however, attract the attention
of one keen and farsighted statesman,
who at the time was chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee and ' the
leader of the House. This was William
R. Morrison of Illinois. Morrison is the
real discoverer of Wilson. Morrison found
that the ex-college president was a stu
dent and had looked deep into the tariff
question. Morrison was looking for men
of that kind and when the next Congress
convened he got Speaker Carlisle to put
Wilson on the Ways and Means Com
mittee. From that time until the blight
of Clevelandism struck the Democratic
party Wilson was a power in Congress.
â¢ * Â«
He was chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee and leader of the
House during the Fifty-third Congress.
He is the author of the tariff bill that
has gone to history labeled with his
name. The industries of West Virginia
were hit hard by the Wilson bill. He
put wool and coal and lumber on the
free list. This touched the pockets of
such Democrats as ex-Senator Henry G.
Davis and ex-Senator J. N. Camden. They
built a cave under Wilson and on election
day his Republican opponent had the bet
ter of him by more than 2000. .
. â¢ â  Â» *
The writer of this accompanied Wilson
during his . last Congressional ! campaign.
I was then the Washington correspondent
of the St. Louis Republic and a very de
voted friend of Wilson. We traveled to
gether, ate together and slept together.'
He. was very primitive in his tastes and
habits. It was his custom to sleep in his
I underclothesâ heavy woolen undercloth-
I ing that he wore during the day and
I perspired through during hours of speech
j making. He was pretty well satisfied
that one good washing a week sufficed;
he had no idea of the luxury of the bath.
My tendency to take cold water outward
ly amused him immensely, and the peel
ing off of all my "duds" at night and
my wearing of night garments he re
garded as a personal invention and to a
great extent a personal affectation. One
night, when our bed was small and our
accommodations very limited indeed, and
he was tired and nervous and could not
sleep, I suggested to him that he might
try my plan of rubbing a cold wet towel
over himself and putting on a nightshirt.
He tried it and soon went to sleep. Since
then he has been devoted to the night
shirt and has hardly ever met me that
he did not express his gratitude for my
"higher education" of him. In fact It
! might be said that the nightshirt struck
j Wilson as the game of poker struck the
Kentuckianâ like the dawn of a new
revelation.
Wilson campaigned in very light march
ing order. When he left home his wife
habitually put a clean handkerchief in the
stern-wheel pocket of his trousers. He
made this do duty until he again got
home sometimes perhaps for two or three
weeks. He hated to bother with a valise,
and he regarded a pocketful of papers and
data and a tooth brush as about all that
civilization and emergency demanded of
him to carry. A nail brush that was a
part of my equipage and that I made
work for a living attracted him. He had
never known the use of this article be
fore. He became delighted with it.
Wilson was very much in the dumps at
the time that Cleveland called him to the
Cabinet. A couple of weeks before Ike
Grey of Indiana had died and thereby
created a vacancy in the embassy to
Mexico, Wilson was a candidate for the
post. He expected to get it and wanted
it "mighty bad." But old Matt Ransom
of North Carolina, who had been in the
Senate twenty-four years, had been
knocked out by the Republicans and Pop
ulists of his State and he succeeded in
getting all the Senators to sign a petition
to the President asking for his appoint
ment. He got it, and Wilson was very
sore. He talked freely with me at this
epoch about the "ingratitude of Cleve
land." A few weeks later Bissell resigned
from the Cabinet and left the postoffice
portfolio vacant. It was after midnight
when Wilson came to my office. He told
me that the President had appointed him
Postmaster General; that he had gone to
bed, but his wife reminded him that he
owed me a favor, and so he got up to
come to tell me about It and give me a
"scoop." I had performed a whole lot of
favors for Wilson, and this was the only
occasion that he performed a favor for
mo. Even that time he admitted that his
wife reminded him of It. His mind was
not constituted to think of little things
like that himself.
* * â¢
I have not seen Wilson since the 27th
of September, 1896. He returned from
Europe the day before, and for a week
preceding my office was crowded with
West Virginians urging me to use my in
fluence with Wilson "not to destroy him
self" by bolting the Chicago ticket. I
went to see the Postmaster General at
his office. He candidly told me that he
would not support the Democratic ticket.
'He said that he regarded himself as in
honor bound to stand with Mr. Cleveland.
I asked him if he felt under more obli
gations to Cleveland than to the Demo
crats of his State, and he, without saying
so. plainly intimated "yes."
A week later he was heartbroken. The
West Virginians made life a torture to
him. He went up to Charlestown to make
a speech for Palmer and Buckner. He- was
met at the depot by three white men and
about 300- negroes. It subsequently de
veloped that his old friends had hired
the negroes to go and receive him. He
delivered I a masterly address at a public
hall, but only fourteen white men heard
him. His neighbors "cut" him. Not one
of his old friends would speak to him.

PROSPERITY AND POLITICS.
PRESIDENT McKINLEY has shown all of
that political tact and sound common sense
for which he is noted in making the prosperity
of the nation and the people the chief theme of his
addresses to the various audiences that greet him on
his tour through the Mississippi Valley. Prosperity
is indeed the issue of 1 mount interest in the poli
tics of the year, for after all is said and done the
question which the voters will ask themselves in
Ohio and lowa and Nebraska when they go to the
polls will be whether they shall vote for the party
of prosperity or the party of calamity.
The attempt of Bryan and his followers to revive
popular interest in the silver question has failed, and
in not a single State where campaigns are going on
does it hold a prominent place in the discussions of
the people or tnc press. An effort to make a vital
issue on the trust problem has also led, and im-
periah.-.m remains an affair oi individuals rather than â¢
of partes. In such a condition of politics the only
recourse cf the Democratic orators 1- to denounce
the administration generally and ask for its condem- :
nation upon its record as a whole and not upon any
particular feature, of its policy.
So far. then, as the State campaigns affect na
tional questions at all tin- issue is that of supporting
the administration or opposing it. That fact gives
pertinence to the President's references to the abun- |
dant prosperity which prevails under the operation of
Republican legislation. A protective tariff has
restored our industries, which were stricken ;
down by the Democratic tariff adopted during the ;
Cleveland administration, and the maintenance of ;
sound finance has given confidence to business of all
kinds. From years of panic and depression we have
passed to years of activity in all lines of effort and
every section of the country, and every class of the
people have been benefited.
In his speeches the President has put the issue
fairly before the people. At Vincennes he said: "We
have been blessed with good crops and fair prices.
Wages and employment have waited upon labor and,
differing from what it was a few years ago, labor is
not waiting on the outside for wages. Our financial
condition was never better than bow. We have good
money and. plenty of it circulating as our medium of
exchange. Banks may fail, fluctuation in prices come
and go, but the money of the country remains al
ways good, and when you have a dollar of it you
know that dollar is worth one hundred cents, because
b-ck'of it is the Government of the United States."
At Danville, 111., he treated the issue in another
way and illustrated the degree of our prosperity by
pointing out how easily the people carry an amount
of taxation which to any other people would be an
oppressive burden. "We are," he said, "collecting
just now $1,000,000 for every working day of the
month on our internal revenue taxes and you don't
seem to be very much oppressed here on that ac-
lint We are collecting about $650,000 every work
ing day of every month from the tariff that we put on
foreign products that come into the United States
from other countries and that does not seem to give
you any serious trouble here."
Against the party to whose legislation this prosper
ity is due. and against the administration under which
it has been attained, there is arrayed the party of free
trade, fiat money, class antagonisms and general dis
content. With such a choice before them the intel
ligent voters of the States where elections are to be
held will hardly hesitate. There may be local issues,
or faction fights,, or personal prejudices, or old party
ties which will incline men to vote the Democratic
ticket in those States this fall, but upon national ques
tions there is nothing on which Democracy can
rightly expect the suffrage of a single intelligent pa
triot
The testimony in the Hite divorce case indicates
somewhat clearly that the purchase of a man's honor
is one of the few things that is not -worth the price.
Several of the witnesses have admitted that they re
ceived money from both sides and now feel perfectly
free to be true to neither.
Under the new charter it may be possible to pass
a regulation that police detectives shall not be vac
cinated. In such a case they may be expected to
catch something.
MR. DAY'S EXPLANATION.
aUDGE DAY of Ohio, who was president of
,-,1 the American Peace Commission which nego
tiated with Spain the' Paris treaty, has written
; a letter, published yesterday, explaining the character
of our title to the Philippines.
In this he declares that we have no title by con
i quest. He says: "It must be remembered that we
were in possession only of the city, bay and harbor
of Manila under the protocol of August 12, 1898, pro
viding that the United States should occupy and hold
the same* pending the conclusion of the treaty of
peace."
Gradually from the most authoritative sources the
clouds and mists which have obscured our Philippine
situation are being cleared away. We were in
possession only of Manila city, bay and harbor. Who
held possession of the rest of the islands? Every
Spanish soldier in Luzon, Panay, Cebu and Negros
was a prisoner of war held by the Filipino army and
government. That government, organized by a
proclamation which our Consul Wildman officially
reports that he prepared for Aguinaldo, was engaged
in administration and, as Wildman reports, was exer
cising civil authority "with dignity and justice."
On December 21, .1898, President McKinley
through the Secretary of War, transmitted to General
Otis at Manila an order and proclamation in these
terms: "The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the
harbor of Manila by the United States naval squad
ron, commanded by Rear Admiral Dewey, followed
by the reduction of the city and surrender of the
Spanish forces, practically effected the conquest of
the Philippine Islands and the suspension of Spanish
sovereignty therein. With the signature of the treaty
of peace at Paris on the 10th inst., and as the result
of the victories of American arms, the future con
...
trol, disposition and government of the Philippine
Islands are ceded to the United States. In fulfillment
of the right of sovereignty thus acquired and the re
sponsible obligations of government thus assured,
the actual occupation and administration of the en
tire group of the Philippine Islands becomes imme
diately necessary, and the military government here
tofore maintained by the United States in the city,
harbor and bay of Manila is to be extended with all
possible dispatch to the whole of the ceded territory.
* * * All persons who, either by active aid or by
honest submission, co-operate with the Government
of the United States to give effect to these beneficent
purposes will receive the reward of its support and
protection. All others will be brought within the
lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness if need
be, but without severity so far as may be possible."
In President McKinley's address to the returned
Pennsylvania Volunteers two months ago he said:
"Until the treaty was ratified we had no authority
beyond Manila city, bay and harbor. We then had
no other title to defend, no authority beyond that to
maintain. Spain was still in possession of the re
mainder of the archipelago. Spain had sued for
peace. The truce and treaty were not concluded."
Now, as the treaty was not ratified until February
6, 1899, under the President's own declaration,
whence did he derive authority for his order of occu
pation of December 21, 1898?
At Pittsburg he said: "Until the treaty was rati
fied (February 6, 1899) we had no authority beyond
Manila city, bay and harbor. We then had no other
title to defend, no authority beyond that to main
tain." But on the 2i.-t of the preceding December
he had ordered Otis to "immediately extend the
military government of the United States to the
whole" of the Philippine Islands,!
In the same order he informed Otis that we had
"completed their conquest," while at Pittsburg he
declared that when that order was issued we had no
title nor authority over the islands beyond the city,
bay and harbor, for "Spain was still in possession of
the rest of the archipelago."
Now Judge Day says we had no title by conquest,
though the President asserted such title last Decem
ber. We beg to remind the President that his ad
ministration represents, in a large sense, the country,
and in an important sense the party which elected
him. Therefore the discrepancy between his Decem
ber proclamation and his Pittsburg speech becomes
of overshadowing importance. If, as he said at Pitts
burg, "Spain was still in possession of the rest of the
archipelago" until February 6, 1899, his December,
1898. order for its immediate military occupation by
the United States was a Presidential declaration of
war, a violation of the protocol of August 12, 1898,
and an exercise of authority that he dijj not possess.
If Spain were in possession until February 6, as he
declared at Pittsburg, the armed conflict of February
4. upon territory to which "we had no title to de

thority which was not ours.
We are unable to reach any other conclusion, and
what the Republican party needs and the country will
require is an explanation of the order of December
21, 1898, in the light thrown upon it by the Presi
dent's speech and Judge Day's letter.
THE NEED OF THE STATE LIBRARY.
REPORTS from Sacramento are to the effect
that some very important changes may soon
be made in the arrangements of the interior of
the Capitol, inasmuch as the number of volumes in
the State library has increased so rapidly it will be
necessary to provide more space in the building for
storing them. It is said the librarian finds it impos
sible to make room for all the books, and the trus-
tees have applied for the use of the Supreme Court
room for use as a law library.
On that showing it will be conceded the first and
most pressing need of the State library is for more
room and more ample accommodations for its vol
umes. It would. be of little use to add to the num
ber of volumes it they cannot be placed in a position
where they will be convenient and accessible to the
readers. There remains, however, the question
whether the additional space can be better acquired in
the Capitol than elsewhere. If a considerable num
ber of the volumes were in continuous circulation
among the people of the State who are taxed to main
tain the library there would be ample space in the
present rooms to hold those which would remain on
the shelves. ' Â»
i The Call has repeatedly directed attention to the
' many advantages which have resulted from the travel
! ing library system wherever it has been extensively
| applied. The adoption of that system by our State
library would entail little or no additional expense,
i and would at once solve the problem of book storage.
Were it put in operation several thousands of vol
umes now unread and unused at Sacramento would
be circulated throughout the State for the benefit
j of the public and the usefulness of the library thereby
vastly increased.
Should it be found impossible for the trustees of
the library to adopt the traveling system without
authority given by an act of the Legislature, there
is another plan now under consideration in New Eng
land which might soon be undertaken here. with suc
cess. That plan, which was reviewed in The Call
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1899.
a few days ago, proposes to obtain from Congress an
act extending to libraries the right of sending out
books for general circulation through the mails at
the rate of second class mail matter. In other words,
the aim is to obtain for libraries the same mail facili
ties which are now given to publishing houses.
The movement has found such general and strong
support there is every reason to expect Congress- to
grant the desired privilege at the coming session. It
will then be possible, if the trustees see fit, to keep
a large number of the volumes of the State library
in use among the people instead of storing them
idly and unused on the shelves they have already
overcrowded. There will of course be no objection
to the proposed use of the Supreme Court room for a
law library if that course should be deemed advisable
by the Justices and others interested, but the point
to be borne in mind is that the chief need of the
State library is more readers and not more book
shelves. If the library were made to serve the liter
ary requirements of the taxpayers throughout the
State there would be no storage problem to fret the
minds of the trustees for years to come.
WE publish to-day nearly the full text of an
official report made to our Government by an
agent of the War Department upon affairs in
the Philippines. It is something that should instantly
enlist the attention of the American expansionists
and imperialists. The policy of the Government in
the Philippines is at this time dictated by them, and
they are responsible for everything that follows the
installation of that policy.
Time will prove that it would have been much
easier to begin right, with an upright, honest and
disciplined administration, than to reform and set
it tight after beginning wrong. Imperialists who are
moved by policy and not by impulse will see in this
report a verification of everything said and predicted
by the anti-imperialists. They will see also that un
less vigorous measures are taken to mend our man
ners and purify administration in the islands the
charge will stand that it is a war for the profit of army
followers and contractors.
The report makes an American feel as if he is in
a strange country. It reveals matters that two years
ago seemed so foreign to our scheme of government
and to the genius of our people that one is brought
face to face with a startling change. The unhappiest
of all revelations is that of the persistence of race
prejudice. In our administration abroad we are reap
in; the consequence of so long leaving that prejudice
unbridled at home. The contempt felt for the In
dian, negro and Chinese has been fostered rather than
suppressed. In the Philippines this prejudice flares
up against a people we must have always with us, if
we hold the islands, for none but the natives and the
Chinese can live there and work and produce a sur
plus of the articles of commerce. This prejudice
st; nds in the way, whether our motive in occupa
tion is merely commercial or really educative. A race
against which we feel that prejudice is not to be
educated and elevated by another race that holds it
in contempt and regard it as inferior. It may bet
ter be trusted to continue self-education, with self
government and independence as the prize for its
success.
The report conveys much information on the sub
ject of the indignation and hostility of the people,
and leaves no doubt that the Americans are hated,
if anything, more cordially than were the Spaniards.
Through this report and the declarations of Judge
Day and President Sehurman the people are getting
needed light upon the appalling problem which has
arisen in the East and promises to remain for many
a day to tax our resources and our patience.
THE CUBAN PROBLEM.
J\,\ ORE and more clearly do the imperialists as
/ \ sert their intention to violate all the profes
sions of the Government with regard to Cuba
and if possible bring about the annexation of the
island to our empire. They do not, indeed, refer to
the Cubans as "our subjects," that word being con
fined as yet to the Filipinos, but they are announcing
with no little assurance that the Cubans are unfit to
govern themselves and that any who show a desire
for independence are lacking in "patriotism."
For the purpose of convincing the American peo
ple of the imperative necessity of establishing a per
manent government in Cuba there is now going on
a campaign of education by the imperialist press. It
Is conducted with no little skill. The public is told
that the better class of Cubans do not wish indepen
dence. It is even said that those who fought for it
against Spain are now of the opinion it would be a
bad thing, and they would prefer not to have it.
Along with the imperialists the owners of the big
sugar and tobacco interests of the islands are work
ing for annexation. Admission to the Union even
as a Territory would mean admission to the full
freedom of trade which prevails throughout our do
main. There would then be vast profits for the men
who controlled the Cuban industries and worked
them with cheap labor.
The issue may have to be met at the coming ses
sion of Congress, and should therefore have the ear
nest attention of the people. Imperialism aims at
more than the conquest of the Philippines. It is sup
ported largely by men who desire to exploit the labor
of tropic islands for their own enrichment, careless
of the consequences to American labor or America
welfare. It is safe to say that at present a popular
vote on the subject would result in an overwhelming
majority against the annexation scheme. A cunning
campaign of education, however, worked up by an
occasional disturbance in Cuba, may have the effect
of converting a good many unreflecting persons tc
the imperial scheme. It is, therefore, well to watch
the movement closely, for there is no telling what
may happen next.
The issue, moreover, has its moral as well as its
material aspect. It is not merely a question* of
whether it be expedient to bring into competition
with the industries of our people those of the tropic
islands. There is the further consideration of na
tional good faith. As the "Boston Transcript says:
"in considering the ultimate destiny of Cuba the law
makers at the Capitol must deal not only with the
wishes of the United States but the desires of Cuba.
They must regard as more than a mere formula that
solemn declaration of President McKinley, reiterated
by Congress, that the United' States disclaims any
intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or con
trol of Cuba except for the pacification thereof, and
that, when that is accomplished, it intends to leave
the government and the control of the island to its
people. He who runs may read and, reading, under
stand this plain statement. It is an outspoken decla
ration against annexation."
There are some things connected with the game of
cricket that the American mind fails to grasp." For
instance, in a match at Germantown between the Eng
lish eleven and the gentlemen of Philadelphia Prince
Ranjitsinjhi was unable to play owing to a sore
throat the Prince is no Lillian Russell, either.

MARCONI'S MOTHER IS IRISH.
Has Lived in Ireland a Great Deal and His First
Practical Experiments in Wireless Telegra
phy Were Conducted There.
WILLIAM MARCONI, whose wire
less telegraphic invention has
made him a peer of Edison and
Tesla in the scientific world, is
not altogether an Italian. His mother has
something to do with it, and she is Irish
of the Irish. Marconi himself betrays the
nativity of his mother in his Irish blue
eyes and his tone of "devilment."
It came about in this way: About a
half a century ago an Italian of the name
of Charles Bianconi settled in Ireland
He was thrifty and enterprising. He
located in Clonmel, the capital of Tip
perary. He established a stage line and
within a dozen years controlled nearly
all the usual routes of transportation in
the southern province of Ireland. In a
little whileâ this, it ought to be re
membered, was before the development
of railroadsâ Bianconi had the contract
for carrying nearly all the Irish mails.
He got "rich, bought an estate and a
castle, and his children are now number
ed among the Irish country gentry.
Bianconi had a nephew of the name of
Marconi, who went to Ireland as chief
veterinary surgeon for the Bianconi
stage routes. This Marconi was a civil
engineer as well as a veterinary surgeon.
He was also an all-around sportsman.

Wireless Telegraphy in Practice.
Cincinnati! Commercial Tribune.
For the first time wireless telegraphy
was put to a practical test during the
races between the Shamrock and Co
lumbia. It was a success, though its
practicability under other conditions is
not absolutely assured.
Moving boats accompanied the yachts
on their course. From these dispatches
were sent to receiving stations along
th( shore. The messages were accurate
ly transmitted and easily read, In ad
dition, there was no loss of time, as
the relative positions of the yachts
were known in the news centers of
New York without the loss of more
than half a minute of time or a min
ute at the furthest. : = r
The system of wireless telegraphy is
explained in a novel way in a news
Item in the Public Ledger. It says "a
better understanding may be had by
illustrating the system by means of
tuning forks. Two forks of the same
key will respond sympathetically each
to the other, if either be set in motion.
Forks of dissimilar keys will not effect
each other, even though they be
brought almost into contact. â¢ So it Is
with the Marconi instruments. Ar
ranged by the master's hand, a score
may be stationed about and each will
respond to any signal from any of the
others. But by a simple reversal the
apparatus may be individualized and
signals exchanged between the two. while
none of the other eighteen respond."
It may be said that this late test
was under favorable conditions, though
Sig. Marconi has sent messages across
the English Channel, and really believes
that he will yet send them across the
Atlantic, without the use of submarine
cables. It certainly seems possible.
Some of the best electrical talent in
the world is engaged upon the unsolved
problems of wireless telegraphy. Suc
cess in the widest way seems possible,
If not probable.

"YOUNG GUARDIAN ANGELS."
School Children Banded Together to
Protect Dumb Animals.
The ladies of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals are meeting
with gratifying success in their efforts to
present a meritorious entertainment to
raise funds to purchase badges for the
youthful members of the Bands of Mercy.
These youngsters, numbering over 50,000
pupils of the public schools, are being
carefully educated to be kind and mer
ciful to all dumb animals, and many have
actually entered the ffeld of active work.
Their membership in a measure makes
them a part of the parent society, and
feeling this not a few are on the lookout
for cases of cruelty, which are reported
to. the secretary or the organization for
investigation. A number iof cases have
been thus discovered and the culprits ar
rested and punished by the proper of
ficers of the law.
Thus the influence of the Bands of
Mercy, aside from the educational fea
tures, is being felt in the community, for
no person who is abusing his animals
knows who may be witnessing the abuse,
to become an Important factor in his pros
ecution. The badges of membership which
the ladies are arranging to purchase are
simply to be the evidence that the wear
ers belong to the organization. The public
is responding liberally to the call for
money for this worthy purpose.
Ample talent has volunteered for the
entertainment, which is to be held next
It takes a very daring rider to win dis
tinction in Ireland, a country of daring
riders, but Marconi accomplished that
feat. He did 'something else. He cap
tured the daughter of Power of Gurteen,
one of the haughtiest of the rural Irish
aristocracy, and took her to Italy on a
bridal tour.
The fruit of that union is the present
distinguished inventor of wireless teleg
raphy.
Marconi has lived a good deal in Ire
land among his mother's relations, but
he was born and educated in Italy. He
considers himself fully half Irish, and
many of his characteristics are more
Irish than Italian.
Marconi's first practical experiments
with wireless telegraphy were made in
Dublin Bay. The first wireless tele
graphic newspaper dispatch was printed
in the Dublin Independent, a not very en
terprising paper published at the Irish
capital.
Marconi has a relative living in this
city engaged in Government employment.
His name ls Power and he is a special
inspector, of the Treasury Department.
Marconi's Irish relatives are well off,
while his Italian relations are poor. His
education was at the expense of his Irish
kindred. If Marconi is not already en
gaged, he hopes to be, to marry a Miss

NOTARY SMITH APPEARS IN A
BAD LIGHT.

Talbott and Bourne Demand of At
torney Monroe to Withdraw
Their Names From the
Complaint.
The suit against the executive council of
the citizens' volunteer reception commit
tee haa practically ' fallen. Two of the
plaintiffs, John E. Talbott and William A.
Bourne, deny that they ever authorized
Attorney Henry' B. Monroe to Institute the
proceedings, and the .former, whose name
is appended w the complaint, denies that
he ever made affidavit to the instrument,
although It bears the notorial seal of Mrs.
K. W. Smith, a notary' public in the Mills
building.
Talbott says that about two weeks be
fore the California regiment was mustered
out of the service he was approached by
a man named John Keogh, who claimed
that he was "on the inside" and knew
that the executive council had "decided to
divide the surplus of the volunteer recep
tion fund into there parts and get away
with it." He argued that it should be di
vided among the soldier boys and sug
gested that a petition of that nature be
signed by them. He said that he was not
acting In the matter for his health, and
expected to make something out of it him
self. Keogh was acting as the agent of
Attorney Monroe.
At Keogh's house a few days later Tal
bott was presented with a typewritten pa-
per which Keogh represented to be the
petition he had mentioned, and asked the
soldier to sign it. Without reading the
document Talbott did as requested. He
did not swear to it before a notary-
Bourne was approached in a similar way
about ten days ago, and signed what pur
ported to be a petition to the executive
council to divide the funds. It now trans
pires that the paper was an authorization
to Monroe to commence the proceedings
which have resulted in presenting the at
torney in such an unenviable light before
the citizens of Ban Francisco. Reynolds,
the third one of the plaintiffs, cannot be
located.

Monroe yesterday and asked for an expla
nation. He told them that if they did not
care to go on with the. suit he would with
draw their names as plaintiffs. T^his they
demanded, but they were not entirely sat
isfied with such an arrangement. They
claim that the action of the attorney in
using them as his catspaw has greatly in
jured them in the community, and they
t>ropose to hold him to account. They
have made affidavits setting forth all the
facts as stated, and a thorough investiga
tion of the whole proceeding will be in
sisted upon. Notary Smith will be called
upon to do some explaining. She admits
that Talbott never appeared before her to

4:50 a. m. yesterday. The body was taken
to the Morgue and an Inquest will be held
to-day.
Maccabe's death was brought about in
a singular way. He had been drinking
to excess since his young wife deserted
him several months ago. On Wednesday
evening while on his way to visit his
old friend, Police Sergeant Moffit, he
Htepped into a florist's shop to buy a
bouquet for Mrs. Moffit. While waiting
he reeled and fell heavily to the Boor,
striking the back of his head against a
corner of the counter, fracturing his skull.
The unfortunate man was picked up In an
unconscious condition and taken to the
City Receiving Hospital, in which place
he remained until he died.
Maccabe was a native of Ireland and
was about 70 years old. although he looked
twenty years younger. He practiced In
Denver, Colo., for a while before coming
to this city, "divorces obtained or no fee,"
being his motto. Eight years ago he came
to San Francisco and put up his shingle
on Market street, proclaiming himself as
"The People's Lawyer" and offering ad
vice "free of charge."
Sergeant Moffit notified Coroner Hill
yesterday that he would take charge of
the funeral, Maccabe not having a dollar
to his name.

CUTICURA Speedily Cures.
My mother has been a victim to ulcers from
varicose veins for thirty-five years. Eleven of
these terrible sores have existed at one time on
the limb affected. Excruciating pain and intense
suffering were endured, with all sorts of remedies
on trial and numberless physicians' calls and
proscriptions applied, but all practically with
but little benefit. However, at last the remedial
agent was found in Cuticura (ointment), which
surely proved its weight in gold, alleviating pain
and causing healing processes to commence and
a cure speedily effected. She has, also, used
Cuticcra with marked benefit in erysipelas
Of the face and eczema. The Cuticura Soap,
also, has established a record only as the best
cleansing, purifying, and healing in its nature,
having proved itself a most excellent and valu-
able auxiliary to the Cutiouoa (ointment).
I would remark that this testimonial is entirely
unsolicited, being a voluntary contribution for
humanity's sake, and the commendation of the
Cuticcra Remedies to the fullest confidence,
being satisfied of their purity, genuineness, and
almost miracles wrought.

The transport Conemaugh arrived from
Manila yesterday after a passage of thir
ty-six days. She was in Nagasaki with
the Newport, and fifty-seven of the sol

came home on the Conemaugh. They say
their quarters on the Newport were not
fit to live in and the food was disgusting.
They therefore seized the first opportu
nity to leave the vessel. The United States
Consul at Nagasaki sent them home on
the Conemaugh. Among them were fif

INVESTIGATED
MAIL SYSTEMS
OF EUROPEANS
â¦ ; j
Congressman ; Loud
Back From Abroad.
4, . ;
Congressman Eugene F. , Loud returned
yesterday from a three months' trip
through some of the principal countries
of Europe, where he had gene to investi
gate the postal systems in' vogue there
for the purpose of adapting to our sys
tem any desirable Improvements he might
find. His daughter accompanied him on
the trip. Congressman Louts was in Paris
during the height of the Dreyfus excite
ment and made some interesting com
ments thereon in the course of an inter
view. He went to Europe '.on behalf of
the Postal Commission, which was cre
ated by Congress two years ago and of
which body he is a member. Speaking
of the official part of his trip he said:
"I went to Europe to Investigate the
postal systems there for tile purpose of
making comparisons with oiir own, more
particularly as to cost. I have, however,
been unable to work up ail the figures,
and it will be a month before I will be
able to do so. We found it a- difficult mat
ter to get the kind of Information we
wanted. We had to get a little here and
a little there as best we could. To illus
trate, we desired to ascertain what cer
tain railroads were paid for: carrying the
mails. We got the price, but we then had
to go through a lot of records to ascer
tain the mileage of the roads and the
amount of mall matter they transported.
"I found nothing in Europe that was an
improvement on the service we have.
Without boasting, I think our service is
superior to any in the world, and when
we consider the high wage's we pay in
comparison with the wages paid in
Europe it is surprising thai our service
is as economically handled as it is. We
pay four and five times as touch for ser
vice as they do in Europe. I The English
service is the highest paid in Europe. The
highest salary a man may gain there is
80 shillings, equal to about 47 50, a week.
They begin at 18 and work tip to 30 shil
lings. This applies to clerks,' carriers and
railway mail clerks. Our postofflce clerks
average $900 a year and begin at $600. Our
carriers average $950 and get, $1000 after
two years, while railway mail clerks aver
age $1050. Yet . our service son the whole
is about as cheaply managed. as theirs
This is largely due to the svstemlzing of
the work with us- and to thâ¢ fact that
our men do more work than- the men em
ployed in the European countries. This
applies to all branches of business."
London, Paris and Berlin ! were visited
officially by Congressman Loud, but he
also traveled through Belgium and Hol
land. Referring to his experiences in
Paris he said: i' i
"I was in the French capital all through
the Dreyfus excitement. It. was a dif
ficult matter to get at the real sentiment
of the people on this sublet. ! I was told
by a gentleman who has been connected
= -
MISS MINDEL DREYFUSS.
with a foreign legation in Paris for
twenty years that the sentiment of the
better class of people was for Dreyfus,
but that the lower classes, being' more
closely allied with the army, were against
Dreyfus. I will say this, if it were not
for the English and American newspapers
which we get there we would not have
known that there was any excitement in
Paris. I reached London after the riot
had taken place in Paris, and I was ad
vised not to go there. When I arrived at
Paris I saw no indications of any trouble.
The people there did not seem to appre
ciate that anything extraordinary was
transpiring."
KOPP WAS HEARTLESS.
His Daughter Testifies *in Favor of
Her Mother, Who Shot Him.
Evidence to prove that Mrs. Louisa
Kopp was justified in ending her hus
band's life on June 28 last was produced
yesterday in Judge Dunne's court during
the trial of the woman on a charge of
manslaughter. Miss Amanda Kopp,
daughter of the defendant, was again
placed on the stand by her attorneys, and
said that her dead father never con
cealed his attachment for. Mrs. Monte,
the widow, who was the Immediate cause
of the killing. The young witness testi
fied that on frequent occasions her father
threatened her mother with a hammer,
and one time struck her with It. Again
he used a piece of a chandalier as a
weapon, and on another occasion choked
his wife. In order to make her life the
harder to bear he inserted an advertise
ment in the papers to the effect that he
would not be responsible for any debts
contracted by her. When Mrs. Kopp saw
the advertisement, the daughter said, it
almost broke her heart, and she did not
recover from the nervous strain for some
time.
Mrs. Monte remains in court most of the
day and is an interested listener, and, not
withstanding the relation she bears to the
case, she will not be called as a witness.
The case will probably reach the Jury to
day.

SAN FRANCISCO
DROPPED MONEY
IN THE CANAL
Right to Dig Ended on
Tuesday.
â â
BONDS BECAME WORTHLESS
â¦ .
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THE
LOCAL LOSS.
â¦ â 
Funds Were Subscribed During the
Period of Enthusiasm When
the Outlook Seemed Bright
for Nicaragua Ditch!
During the present week Nicaragua
canal securities to the amount of $200,000
or upward, held by San Francisco mer
chants mainly, have become valueless.
That amount approximately represents
the actual cash help San Francisco gave
to the Nicaragua canal,, in addition to
years of hard work to promote that pro
ject. No one says anything about the loss,
for it has been foreseen for some time
that It was inevitable. The concession j
under which Warner Miller and his asso
ciates operated until the funds gave out
expired by limitation last Tuesday.
Under the concession given to the Eyre-
Cragin syndicate, Nicaragua is estopped
from entering into any dicker for the re-;
newal of any contract with the Warner |
Miller or any other companies. The Eyre- â 
Cragin contract is in actual force. The |
stocks and bonds issued by the Nicaragua j
Construction and Nicaragua Maritime Ca- ;
nal companies were necessarily based on
the possibility of completing the canal. in ;
cash something like $0,000,0u0 has been ex- â 
tended on the ditch. Now the exclusive
privilege to build a canal in Nicaragua :
has passed into other hands and the new j
contract runs for 500 years.
It will be recalled that Senator Miller |
visited this city and opened headquarters j
for the taking of subscriptions for Nica- ;
ragua canal securities a few years ago. |
Local subscribers, in common with many j
subscribers in the East, who took bonds I
of the Construction Company, got as a j
bonus a certain proportion of stock of '
the Maritime Canal Company. The Con- i
struction Company and the Maritime Ca- j
nal Company were controlled by the same :
men, and Warner Miller was the head of j
the enterprise. There was much local en- i
thusiasm upon the occasion of that visit |
of Senator Miller. Committees of citizens j
co-operated with the Chamber of Com- j
merce, which manifested lively interest j
in the work. One large business house
took securities to the amount of $10,000.
Others subscribed .lesser amounts.
It is difficult to get at the exact total of
the Investments at that time. The Bank j
of California acted in a fiduciary capa
city, but subscriptions were taken of j
which the bank had no knowledge. The !
prospect for building the canal then
seemed to be very bright and the move
ment was at the height of its local popu
larity. Had other parts of the United
States responded as well proportionately
as did San Francisco the necessary funds
might have been raised. They did not do
so and Congress failed to support the en
terprise and it has failed for the present.
The San Francisco bond subscriptions
were not a total loss. The bonds carried
interest at the rate of 6 per cent per an
num, and this interest has been regularly
paid. Most of the subscribers Invested
because of public spirit. At the same time
the investment looked to be a very fair
one. Warner Miller and his associates
worked under the Cardenas-Menocal con
tract. The following extract from the
contract made between the Government
of Nicaragua and Eyre-Cragin tells of
ficially the fate of the first named con
tract: '
It la understood, for the purposes of this
contract, that the Cardenas-Menocal contract
shall cease on the Sth day of October, 1599; and
therefore, all the foregoing stipulations shall
take effect without necessity of further ac
tion, declaration or law, on the 10th day of Oc
tober, 1899, or sooner, should the Messrs. Eyre
and Cragin, their heirs or assigns, obtain the
rescission of the Cardenas-Menocal contract.
FRAUDULENT PENSION CLAIMS.
United States Marshal Shine yesterday
arrested William Leland, an Inmate of
the National Soldiers' Home in Yount
ville, Napa County, on a warrant issued
by the United States Attorney at Au
gusta, Me., charging Iceland with having
sworn falsely to a claim for a pension.
The crime was alleged to have been com
mitted in Chelsea, Me., in October, 1897.
The Federal authorities of the State of
Maine have been looking for Leland ever
since. Marshal Shine was notified only a
short time ago and succeeded in landing
his man. Mr. Shine will take the prisoner
back to Maine.

BOXERS MAKE
A FARCE OF
THEIR BOUTS
Russell Wins on a Foul,
While the Police Stop the
Turner-Reilly Bout.
The thirty-live rounds of boxing outlined
ca the gramme of the National Ath
letic Club for last night dwindled down to
six, and of these there was only one round
of clean give â id take hitting. Both Tur
ner and Reilly gave a brilliant exhibition
in the first round of their bout, In the
second round li Illy went down twice and
the police stopped what at the moment
seemed a one-sided match. It was said
afterward that Reilly went down to draw
his opponent's fire, thinking he would rush
In blindly to finish him.
Tho event of the evening was a roaring
farce from first to last, and as such was
hugely enjoyed by the spectators. It
came to a sudden stop in the fourth
round, when Referee Jordan gave the de
cision to Russell on a foul. The foul con
sisted in Van Buskirk biting Russell's ear
until the blood llowed freely. It was an
nounced that the nun would box straight
asbery rules, but the bout developed
into a rough ana tumble, eaten as catch
can affair almost at the nrst Bound of the
Â£OI)Â£.
Contrary to the reports sent out from
Van Buskirk's training quarters he was
palpaDly not in condition for a fight. Fat
nurig in rouis about ins belt while he was
t-tiuggnng lor breath after the nrst scrim
mage, rtusseii carried do superfluous
tiesh, but be was an exploded "phenom"
alter tne first exchange of blows. He had
no guard apparently, simply standing and
waiting for a blow to land and then
clinching.
Alter each clinch he showed he was pos
sessed oi great strength by rushing \'an
Busk to the ropes, where he neid him
in a deathlike grip.
Two. \\.isiier\>omen with wet towels
could do more execution than the big fel
lows while they were boxing. Russell
Clinched peatedjy and Van buskirk pep
pered him at snort range, but without
seeming damage. They were roughing it
so much in the first round that Captain
of Police Gilien warned them to desist.
The spectators made preparations to leave
after the first round, as that showed them
the caliber of the men as boxers.
In the second round each landed some
blows, but none were effective. Toward
the end of the round Russell followed Van
Buskirk around the ring, hitting him at
will, but not hard Van Buskirk tried
some wild swings in the third round, all
of which went wide of the mark. The
only effect was to leave him putting like a
wheezy bellows at the end of the round.
In the fourth round the men hugged one
another like dancing bears, while Referee
Jordan grew purple in the face trying to
drag them apart. The round was hardly
halt over when Jordan stopped the men
and awarded the bout to Russell. Tha
foul consisted of biting his ear.
The bout between Turner and Reilly
was merry milling while it lasted, which
was less than two rounds. When the men
came together In the second round they
assumed he crouching position so mucn
favored by "Kid" McCoy. Both feinted
fur a few moments, when Reilly caught
Turner heavily with a left swing on the
he-ad. This aroused Turner to action and
he promptly eked Reilly down.
The latter took a reasonable time before
facing the music again. When he did so
Turner promptly knock him down
again. At this juncture Captain of Police
Gilien 3tepped into the ring i (stopped
the bout. Reilly jumped to his feet and
walked to his corner with a crestfallen
manner. The spectators called for a
draw. Referee Jordan said that as Tur
ner had the best of it up to the time the
bout was stopped by the police he would
give him Ihe decision.
Reilly forced the going In the first round
and made a good showing against Tur
ner, who is a marvclously clever boxer
and stiff puncher. In one exchange it was
give and take, with a chance of either
man going out at any moment. Near the
end of the round Turner knocked Reilly
down and huer caught him twice with left
hocks. Reilly returned the compliment in
kind, drawing blood from Turner's mouth.
When the out was stopped Reilly
looked in much worse condition than he
really was. but with the Franey fatality
fresh in mind Captain Gil len took no
chances of a recurrence of I bat affair.
The betting was 10 to 5 on each fight
throughout the day. Turner and Van Bus
kirk being the favorites. The Paris mu
tti.ils at Harry Coibett's paid $* 25 for
each dollar played on Russell and $7 "> for
Turner.
Russell was seconded by Munroe. Martin
Murphy and "Jimmy" Lawlor, while in
Van Buskirk's corner were Frank Bur
ton, Al Neill and ".lack" Morris.

BOXER VAN BUSKIRK LOSES TO RUSSELL ON A FOUL.
The boxing bouts at the National Athletic Club last night did not consume
much time. Referee Jordan stopped Heavyweights Van Buskirk and Russell in
the fourth round of their bout. He awarded the decision to Russell, as Van
Buskirk was biting his ear. The police stopped the Turner-Reilly bout in the
second round*
a contract by the terms of which they
are to furnish Sunday baseball, to be
played in Maryland, five and a half miles
out of this city, during the championship
season of 1900. The other parties to the
contract are owners and operators of a
street railway.
PLAYS EXCELLENT GOLF.
Mrs. Fox Defeats Miss Sands on the
Philadelphia Links.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 12. -As good an
article of golf as any one would care to
see was played to-day in the second round
for the woman's championship of the Uni
ted States. The stars of the day were
Mrs. Caleb F. Fox of the Huntingdon
Valley Cricket Club, Rydale, Pa., and
Miss Anna Sands of the Newport Golf
Club, Newport, R. I. Although Miss
Bands was defeated by Mrs. Fox, the
Newport player was by no means dis
graced and was heartily applauded for
her uphill work. The golf of Mrs. Fox
has been the sensation of the tournament,
although in the preliminary round her
name was little mentioned for champion
ship honors.
Mrs. Fox's opponent to-morrow for the
semi-final round will be Miss Marion
Oliver of Albany, N. Y. Miss Oliver is
another player who has surprised the
talent. The other winners to-day were
Miss Ruth Underhill of Glencove, L. 1.,
and Miss Elsie Cassatt of this city.

Oppression.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Oct. 12.â impe
rial irade has been issued abolishing all
measures that prevented the free move

In addition to these remedial measures
the irade pardons fifty-four prisoners and
commutes to imprisonment, for life the

It was thought yesterday by physicians
that the case was one of varioloid, but an
other examination to-day showed it to be
smallpox in Its worst form.
The patient is Beecher Slooo. a milk

Bain Prevents Racing.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct., 12.â The trot
ting races were postponed to-day on ac
count of rain. There will be a double
programme to-morrow.
TWO CHOICES
BOWLED OVER
AT OAKLAND
Horton Had a Narrow Escape.
Novia and .Wyoming
Earned Brackets.
The light downpour of rain left a vel
vety surface to the track at Oakland and
yesterday the members of the "patched
up" brigade ran like two-year-olds. Of
the five favorites sent to the post three,
Wyoming, Tenrlca and Horton were re
turned winners.
It seemed as if Galen Brown's Wyoming
could be half good and beat the bunch he
was pitted against in the first event, a
six-furlong selling run. The ring laid as
good as 6 to 5 about him, and he came
home alone, three open lengths before
Don Luis, an 8 to 1 sled, well supported.
Rosalbra made a bid for the purse, but
stopped noticeably the last part.
Novia, the speedy Islington mare, carry
ing the Spreckels colors, pocketed the sec
ond purse. She was third choice in the
betting to Yule and Sorrow, and with
Jack Ward in the saddle was never head
ed. Alicia, contender from the jump, was
beaten but a neck and could have scored
had the distance been further. Mounce,
on the favorite Yule, rode in wretched
form, running unplaced.
A selling handicap, over one mile and
a sixteenth, turned out "oil from the can'
for Tenrica. Tommy Walsh, the protege
of "Butch" Fisher, sat on her back, and
reserving his rush for the last furlong
won galloping. Postel with the leg up on
Anchored found the longest way around
the track, and at the wire was downed
a neck for the place by Stromo. Mon
rovia, the second choice, undoubtedly pre
fers the sprinting distance.
For the fourth event, a scramble over
the Futurity course, Horton was served
up a steaming hot 2 to 7 choice. Frawley
nearly gave the chestnut colt's backers
heart disease, as at the paddock Horton
looked beaten. His gameness pulled him
through, for he forged ahead from there,
leading I Don't Know over the line a
scant length. Whitcomb ran third.
Beyond peradventure of a doubt, if
Frawlev were to get lost on the burning
sands of Death Valley he would stumble
across a hitherto unknown well and fall
in. In a race he can find pockets that
would shame a classic member of the
light-fingered fraternity. In the conclud
ing chapter he had the mount on Polish,
the favorite, and the books were to have
received a jarring. As the field broke
Frawlev managed to get his mount's head
through the webbing, taking all but the
posts and Ferguson with him. He lost
several lengths, but hugged the rail and
lost the decision by less than a length to
Ringmaster. The latter horse, however,
won cleverly. Tiburon, which made all
the running, finished a close third.

Enlarged to 16 Pages
$1 per Year.SUPREME COURT
PUTS PREMIUM
ON NEGLIGENCE
It Is Not a Crime if
Eyes Are Closed.
REMISSNESS IS PROFITABLE
Judge Daingerfield Forced to Instruct
a Jury in Keeping With It
and a Disagreement
P-esults.
A recent decision handed down by tne
Supreme Court. placing a premium on" neg
ligence and making "remissness" on the
part of corporation employes a profitable
matter lor corporations, has prevented
the recovery of damages from the South
ern racific Company by the widow and
aged parents of Christen P. Bladt, who
was crushed to death beneath the wheels
of a locomotive at Estudillo Station, near
San Lorenzo, In the early morning of
July 29 of last year. On the morning of
the accident Bladt started for Oakland to
sell a load of fruit. Believing that no
train was near, he started to cross the
track, and the next instant he was hurled
unconscious to the dust, injured unto
death. Some time later he was removed
to his home, but died shortly after he
arrived th.-re.
His widow, Helene K. Bladt, and dece
dent's parents filed suit against the cor
poration to recover $20,000 damages for his
death. In the complaint it was set forth
that the corporation employes failed to
sound a warning whistle or ring the bell
when approaching the crossing, and that
after the train had hurled Bladt to the
roadside they refused to go back and ren
der him aid. A general denial on the part
of the Souther Pacific joined the issues,
and the case went to trial before Judge
Daingerfleld. Considerable evidence was
produced substantiating plaintiffs' claim
that the corporation employes were re
sponsible by reason of negligence for the
accident, while on the other hand the en
gineer and fireman of the locomotive tes
tified that the whistle was blown at the
proper place and that the bell was sound
ed to warn any one approaching the
track. After this testimony was in At
torney Peter F. Dunne, who represented
the company, examined the engineer and
fireman at length on the point as to
whether or not they saw the vehicle oc
cupied by Bladt approaching the track.
Both testified positively that they did not,
and the reason for the lengthy examina
tion on this point became clear when the
instructions Wc-re presented to the tin,
as among them was that based on the Su
preme Court decision making miss
ness" on the part of employes Stable
to the corporation. This decision was
handed down in the case of Herbert vs.
the Southern Pacific Company, and holds
that if the negligence or the injured party
puts him in peril and his peril is noticed
by the defendant twhich in this case re
fers to the defendant's agents, the engin
eer and fireman), and by the exercise of
ordinary diligence the defendant could
have avoided the injury, and lid not, the
defendant will be held liable for the in
jury. This rule is based, however, con
tinues the court, on the theory that the
defendant did know the plaintiff's peril,
and is not based on the proposition that
the defendant would have discovered the
peril of plaintiff but for remissness on his
part. "Under this rule," the Supreme
Court decision concludes, "the defendant
Is not liable because he ought to have
known the peril of plaintiff." As an in
struction based on this decision was de
manded by the company's attorney. Judge
Daingerfield had no alternative but to give
1. The jury filed out. and after being out
all night was unable to agree and was
discharged.
Many attorneys in the court spoke of
the danger to the people and the protec
tion to the company in the decision above. I
All a locomotive engineer must do now to i
protect the company is to whistle out a
â¢juarter of a mile from a station or a
.rossing. open his throttle and turn his
back: If he leaves a trail of maimed and
lead in hi.s wake his employers are not li- j
ible because he ought, to have attended to
luty ar.d known the peril of the dead and
injured! which he did not. and in his ig
norance of their peril, in his "remissness^"
ne has given his employers protection
and saved them financial loss. Had he
oeen negligent with open eyes the com
aany would be forced to pay, in Supreme
Court logic, but negligence wit! closed
.yes covers a multitude of sins and saves
i multitude of dollars.
THEGBAID PUNCHED SLADKY.
Bad Feeling Engendered Through a
Case in Judge Mogan's Court.
The case of R. W. Theobald, charged
ivith the embezzlement of $16 40 by
Tharles W. Sladky, ex-proprietor of the
SLammam Baths, for whom he was agent,
las been dragging along in Judge Mogan's
lotirt since March last.
Yesterday there was a further hearing
n the case, witnesses for the defense ap
pearing to testify, and another contlnu
ince was granted till Tuesday.
When all parties left the courtroom In
i bunch and faced each other in the cor
â¢idor. Sladky angrily said to Theobald.
'Who are you looking at?" and Theobald
replied, "At you." Then Theobald re
;orted by asking Sladky, "Who are you
ooking at?" and Sladky gave the same
â¢eply, "At you." Theobald shot out his
â¢ight fist and smote Sladky in the facÂ»,
md was dragged away by his attorney,
Seel B. Terry.
Sladky hurried into court and demanded
hat the Judge should issue a warrant for
Theobald's arrest on the charge of bat
ery, but the Judge advised him to wait
ill this morning as his warrant clerk had
rone for the day.

bad looking
|The New V' rk Herald of September 24
published an article exposing Advani arid
characterizing him as a swindler and for
ger. He went to Ottawa in the beginning
of September, where he registered ... the
Russell House, the leading hotel there,
and soon made lots of friends in society.
He was introduced to Lord Mime, the
Governor General of Canada, and got an
introduction to the Bank of British North
America, where he explained that he had
deposited in the National Bank of India,
in London, Â£&Â»>. to his credit. He got a
lot of valuable jewelry from a leading
Jewelry firm, and the proprietor of the
Russell House cashed all his checks with
out demur. Then he disappeared after
getting a letter of introduction to the
branch of the Bank of British North
America here.
â¢ Advani turned up in New York and soon
made the acquaintance of the Hindoo
merchants there and secured from Roos
tarn Beramji $6.. in cash and several hun
dred dollars' worth of goods. After leav
ing New York he went to Chicago, where
he cut a wide swath in society md be
came engaged to Miss Virginia Tyler Hud
son, a reporter on the Evening News. She
is a daughter of the late Rev. D. L. Hud-
Eon of Madison, Ind., and a gran.;.:
ter of the late ex-Piesident Tyler. Among
his effects is a letter from her dated
"Palmer House, September 21," in which
she speaks of how highly honored she
felt at the prospect of being the wife of
such a distinguished man. He bought a
diamond engagement ring for her from
C. D. Peacock, a jeweler in Chicago, and
gave in payment a draft on the Bank of
British North America, Ottawa. He was
arrested on a dispatch from Ottawa for
sending a "fake" draft, but as the Cana
dian authorities did not care to be at the
coat of extraditing him he was released
from custody. That finished his career
in Chicago. "Prior to his exposure, how
ever, he had opened an account with the
Commercial National Bank in Chicago on
the same representations he had made to
the Ottawa Bank, and received a check
book from the bank.
Chief Lees saw the article in the New
York Herald and made up his mind to
watch for the swindler If he should come
this way. Captain Seymour learned
Tuesday that Advani had arrived here
on the steamer Umatilla from Victoria
the previous day, and at once notified the
Chief. They went to the various banks
to warn them to be on their guard and
learned from the local manager of the
Bank of British North America that Ad
vani had already been there, but they had
taken from him the letter of introduction
which he had obtained by fraud and the
check book. They ascertained that Advani
had called at the Bank of California with
two ladies whom he met on the Umatilla,
to each of whom he had given a draft for
$300 on the Chicago bank, to deposit the
drafts for collection. He also deposited
[a draft in his own name for $1000 for
collection and wanted an advance of $50
on it, but was refused. He claimed he
had lost his letters of introduction and
check books. He went to another bank
and deposited a draft for 1600 for collec
tion and got an advance of $25. He also
went to Thomas Cook & Son, the tourist
agents, to purchase a ticket for Los An
geles and gave them a draft for $600, ex
pecting to get the change when he called
â¢ yesterday, hut he was too late. Besides
' all this he had deposited with the Lon
don, Paris and American Bank a draft
for Â£8000 on the London and County
Bank, London, England, which he Intend
ed to draw upon, so that he did not waste
any time in getting to work.
The Chief had wired to Chicago and
the bank telegraphed a reply to get from
Advani their check book. The Chief and
Captain Seymour discovered that Advani
was a guest at the Grand Hotel and De
tective George McMahon was detailed to
watch for him. He was arrested yester
day after he had paid his bill at the hotel
and was going to Cook & Son to get his
ticket to Los Angeles. He was so hard
up that after his arrival here he pawned
his gold watch, diamond and ruby gold
pin and diamond and ruby ring for $25.
He was taken to the Chief's office and
put through a searching examination. He
stoutly maintained that he was an indigo
merchant from Bombay and that all his
transactions were honorable. He account
ed for his lack of funds by the fact that
his father on learning that he had mar
ried an Englishwoman, Miss Holmes, in
London, had sent word to his bankers In
London to" stop all supplies unknown to
him. He is a Brahmin and his father
would not forgive him for marrying a
Christian. His wife died last April in
giving birth to a daughter, who is with
friends ln England. He said he was first
married when he was 6 years old to a
girl 4 years old. who died when she was
21. Like Sir Harry Cooper, he had stamps
made In New York with banking firms'
names on them and had tetter heads and
other documents printed. Among his

papers were found a number of letters
written by women in New York, Chicago,
Pittsburg and England showing that he |
was a heartbreaker. !
In view of the decision of the Supreme
Court in the Alonzo Whiteman case the i
Chief will not be able to hold Advani as
he.would require to bring witnesses from
London. England, to testify, and he will
reluctantly have to discharge him.
TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION
TO ORGANIZE A CLUB
The members of the various unions af
filiated with the Allied Printing Trades
C Including printers, tereotypers,
web pressmen, printing pressmen, photo
engravers, etc.â have determined to enter
the municipal political campaign and
make a fight for the union label.
A largely attended meeting was held
last night at the headquarters of the
Typographical Union. 533 Kearny street,
and temporary organization effected by
electing Harry Gibb, president of the
Typographical Union, as chairman, andT.
J. Dfnan, president of the Web Press
men, as secretary.
A resolution was unanimously adopted,
and referred to the. committee on plat
form and rules, with instructions to
draw up the platform In accordant to
the spirit thereof. The resolution is as
follows:
Whereas, The membtrs of the unions affil
iated with the Allied Printing Trades Council,
and all men who are In favor of union labor
li.-ing employed on all commercial work, having
found It impossible to secure the use of the
Allied Printing Trades Council label on city
printing; and.
Whereas, .Ml efforts having failed to secure
the appearance of said label without entering
the field of politics: therefore, be it
Resolved, That all union men, and all friends
of union labor, do form .1 political club, which
shall be non-partisan and nun- sectarian, and
the members of said club shall pledge them
selves to support only such candidates for
office who, in the opinion of this club, would,
if elected, fulfill their professions of friendship
for organized labor and the _: lon label.
Th*- chair was instructed to appoint a
committee -on permanent organization and
a. committee on platform and rules. The
following were appointed:
Committee on permanent organizationâ
T. J. Carroll (chairman),; 3. Wainwright,
A. I. Miner, C. Vandervodrt, 11. Pohlman,
J. Smith, N. Ewers, C. Bishop, F. Caler
and J. Benson.

Michaelson. F. 1.. Hall. T. Wall H Ma
honey, F. Ewald, \v. aver, J. J Ken
ny, A. Bramwell, H. Meirnn and J. May
The meeting adjourned to next Sunday
afternoon at 2 (.'clock, at Becker's Hali,
14 Third street, when permanent organiza
tion will be effected, a platform adopted
and possibly several candidates indorsed.
Tre club will open permanent headquar
ters at 14 Montgomery street.
This Is the first instance in the history
of the printing trade of this city where
the members of the unions connected
therewith have affiliated for non-partisan
political purposes. The unions connected
with this movement have a membership
of over 1000, and they are sanguine of ac
complishing much good for the cause of
unionism, irrespective of party.
MILE OF TRACK A DAY.
Rapidity With Which the Valley
Road Is Reing Pushed to
Completion-.
Chief Engineer Storey reports that the
; track of the Valley road Is being pushed
; ahead at the rate of a mile a day and
i that all the other labor In Connection with
! the great enterprise is moving ahead with
j the same gratifying celerity.
The rails are now in plkce five miles
west of Stockton in the direction of Point
Richmond and only about, ten miles of
uncovered ground lies between the end of
the ties and Middle River, the next Im
portant objective point. The track is al
â¢ ready In place In front of Antioch and
has been pushed out to a distance of
about four miles to the westward of that
place.
The foundations of the big steel viaduc*
at the upper end of the El' Hambre Val
ley are already in place and the actual
work of construction will be started some
time next week. As all the steel for this
structure and the bridges has arrived
from the foundries in the East there Is
now nothing to prevent the work being
carried rapidly to completion.
The bridge over the San Joaquin Is fin
ished and now has trains- running over
it. The bridges over the Middle and Old
rivers, however, are not so- far along and
It will take probably until the first part
of next month to finish them.
Work on all the tunnels is progressing
satisfactorily and It is expected that they
will all be in working order within the
next three weeks except possibly the big
Franklin tunnel, which ha*, to be exten
sively retlmbered, which labor will delay
Its completion some two or. three week's
longer than the others. j

WAR TAX TO BE
AMENDED BY THE
NEXT CONGRESS
Millions of Dollars Not

â â¦ â
AMBIGUITY IN THE WORDING
â¦
Undivided Profits of Banks to Pay a
Tax of Two Cents on Each
One Hundred Dollars
Used.
A dispatch received from Washington
yesterday stated that the Internal Reve-
nue Commissioner was about to urge
upon the members of Congress, at the
coming session, the necessity of amending
the war-tax law. BO as to save to the
Treasury many millions of dollars yearly.
which are now uncollectable because of
ambiguity in the wording of the law and
adverse decisions by the courts. Internal
Revenue Agent Burt M. Thomas of this
city said yesterday that there is much
to do for Congress in this matter, in order
to save millions of dollars now lost to
the Government.
"The greatest loss," said Mr. Thomas,
"is the tax on the undivided profits of
banks. According to section 2, paragraph
2, of the war-tax law, all banks having
an undivided surplus must pay the tax
of 2 cents on each $100 used in the bank.
The Attorney General ruled that undi
vided profits in banks were not considered
as capital or surplus and that the banks
did not have to pay the tax. So the
Government lost a large amount of
money. On the other hand the Govern
ment gains considerable money by the tax
on stocks, the tax being on the face valu
ation of the shares. In the northeastern
districts of California between $200,000
and $300,000 per year are lost by the fail
ure to collect the bank tax.
"Some money is lost on the wine tax
by restaurant keepers serving wine in
pitchers instead of bottles which are
taxed, and also by the use of tax stamps
a second and a third time. this loss
could be avoided by taxing the wine in
the winery, or by having strip stamps
fastened to the cork and to the bottle
in such a way that the cork could not
be drawn without breaking the stamp.
I have no doubt that Congress will amend
the law so that those leakages will be
checked."
WELL WON BARS FOR
A FIRST LIEUTENANT
PROMOTION FOR J. D. LEITCH,
POST ADJUTANT.
First of the Regiments Formed Un
der the Last Call Ordered Out
to This Station.
First Lieutenant Joseph Leitch of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, post adjutant of
the Presidio, has been promoted to a cap
taincy of the Twenty-fifth Infantry, and
with the commission comes an order to
join his new command as soon as possi
ble. Company G of the Twenty-fifth, to
which he has been promoted, is the garri
son company at Fort Sam Houston, San
Antonio, Texas, and before long Captain
I.eitch will have to make his way south
ward, unless he is retained in his present
position.
His departure will be a distinct loss to
the Presidio, for among officers and men, j
as well as those 'whose business is with i
j and not of the military establishment, he
â  has earned an enviable reputation for
â  courtesy and kindliness. Captain Leitch
S was an officer of the Fifth Army Corps
that served through the campaign in
| Cuba. He was in all the engagements of
! importance, and when he came to the Pre
sidio with his regiment last June he
brought with him a record to be proud of.
Fort Sam Houston is the headquarters
â of the Department of Texas. It is the
I most important post in the Southwest,
and in the ordinary course of events Cap
'â  tain I.eitch will become a post commander
as well as a captain. He brings to the
position more than the usual experience j
\ and ability. The congratulations of all
his friends follow him to his new com
mand.
The Forty-fifth Infantry, under Colonel
i Dorst, has been ordered to make a start
from Fort Spelling for Manila on October
22. Two companies of the regiment which
have been recruited in Vancouver have
been ordered to await at Portland the go%
'' ing of the Thirty-ninth Infantry, under
Colonel Bullard, but the remaining ten
companies will come to San Francisco and
leave from here. The Thirty-eighth,
under Colonel Wallace, has been ordered
to leave Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, on
the 2"ih Inst., and the Forty-fourth, under
Colonel McClennand, has been ordered to
proceed to this city on October 25. The
Forty-fourth is being recruited at Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas'.
Two cases of diphtheria have developed
in the Twenty-eighth. They were sent to
the general hospital yesterday and were
isolated.
Major Blair D. Taylor, surgeon, U. S.
A., has been ordered to the Hawaiian Isl
ands to take the place of Major Marshall
W. Wood, surgeon, U. S. A., who has
been in charge of the medical department
there. Major Taylor is now on his 'way
out here from the East. Colonel Green
leaf, who was to have proceeded to the
camps in the Hawaiian Islands on his
tour of inspection, has been ordered to
Manila. He will probably sail on the
Hancock, the next transport to leave this
port. - --, . .
Under orders from Washington the fol
lowing female nurses will prepare for ser
vice in the Philippines: Miss Julia Woods,
Miss Edith Rutley. Miss Sibbie Wilson,
Miss Jeanette McDonald, Miss Mary Ly
ons, Miss Lulu Durkee. .Miss Mary Bar
clay and Miss Marcella Doyle. These
nurses will leave for Manila on the first
transport that sails. The service in Manila
is considered most desirable by the fe
male nurses doing duty at the general
hospital at the Presidio, and all those or
dered out to the Islands are rejoicing over
their assignment. They will be put on
duty in the various hospitals in Manila
and its environs, but they will not be as
signed to field duty.
Captain Clarke of Company H. William
J. Watson of Company D and Lieutenant
Colin Hall of Company X of the Kansas
regiment, having been discharged from
the hospital, have rejoined theircommand.
Lieutenant Albert H. Crouse. who has
been in command of Company H, in place
of Captain Clarke, has been assigned to
Company E.
Solomon Mullins and Edward Tomlln of
Company M of the Thirty-first Infantry
have returned to duty. Both men have
been held in detention at the smallpox
camp at the Presido. The Thirty-first
regiment will be released from quarantine
to-day, the time for their detention since
the last case appearing in the regiment
having expired.
General Funston called upon General
Shafter yesterday morning to pay his re
spects. Governor Stanley of Kansas also
called, and was afterward escorted to the
Presidio by Captain Greene, signal officer
on General Shafter's staff, where he was
shown all there was to be seen. He was
given a salute of nineteen guns fired by
the light battery of the Third Artillery.
General Shafter has received a dispatch
from General Otis, requesting that the
families of officers serving in the Philip
pines be induced to stay at home. "There
is no place in the Philippines for the
wives and children of officers," says the
telegram, and hereafter it is probable that
no more of them will be allowed to go out
there at the Government's expense. If they
wish to go there themselves on their own
account It is another matter, but the Gov
ernment will not be responsible for their
transportation or their quarters in the
islands.
Acting Assistant Surgeon NevlH M.
Garrett, having returned from the islands
and having been relieved as attending \
surgeon on the transport Pennsylvania, f
has been ordered to report for duty at the i
general hospital at the Presidio.
Acting Assistant Surgeon George S.
Pitcher has been ordered to proceed to
New York for the annulment of his con
tract.

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial says:
"The upward tendency in all varieties of dried I
fruits continues, and prices are on the verge of j
an advance in a number of prominent lines. De
mand and inquiry are both much heavier, and
brokers and commission men are corresponding
ly jubilant. Even though business ha* seemed
exceedingly dull for me weeks, as a matter
of fact the fall demand has begun much
earlier than usual in some lines. This is due
to the fact that the market ie virtually bare of
some sorts, and buyers are compelled to go into
the market early to supply their customers.
"There is a fairly liberal movement in new
loose Muscatel raisins for consumptive pur
poses. Trading for the past few days has been
active, and some of the large sales reported in
process of negotiation are said to have been
consummated, but that statement cannot be
wholly confirmed. Sultanas are doing better,
and Valencias are moving out at good prices.
"Prunes tend upward, particularly the small
sizes, which are nearly unobtainable. Buyers
pay a premium for all small-sized prunes they
get. and 90s. 80s and 70s an. scarce in all posi
tions. Up to 3".< cis offered in some cases for the
four sizes in bags '.. >. b., while the three sizes
are held firmly at 3c. Demand ls increasing
and movement is much heavier.
"Peaches are firm, and the prices tend up
ward .ii all sizes and grades. Heavy specula
tive buying, removing perhaps 300 cars from the
regular channels of distribution, has had a
hardening effect on the market, and some
grades have gone up with a Jump. None are to .
be had below quotations, and many profess to j
think that further advances will be made \
shortly.
"Apricots, the shortest crop of all the dried
fruits, are firm and fending upward. Buyers
are iking more inquiry, but actual I transac
tions of any considerable size are not known."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â stock market
made a couple of feeble and futile efforts to
advance this morning. The lethargy of the
trading was an invitation to bear aggression
and when a determined leadership developed
for that faction the professional element among
the traders was quick to follow the lead. A
single block of St. Paul of 6500 shares was
quickly followed by another of 4000 shares, of
fered by brokers who are usually employed
by the acknowledged bear leaders. Selling
generally all around the room was the se
quence. The two large blocks of St. Paul
went at 124%, ar.d the price had fallen to
123 Vi in a few minutes. The grangers. New
York Central, Cleveland, Cincinnati. Chicago
and St. Louie and the leading high-priced spec
ialties were the principal sufferers. Brooklyn
Transit was under conspicuous pressure and
dropped to 85%. Pullman made a brilliant ad
vance of 8% points on rumors of the coming
absorption of the leading competitor, which
were denied later. This was an Isolated In
stance of positive strength. Louisville was
the leader of the abortive advance and was
rather firm after having the advance wiped
out. Otherwise the heaviness was quite uni
form. The developments ln South Africa had
very little effect on the market. Call money
worked a shade easier and did not touch
higher than 7 per cent. What with last Sat
urday's receipts of gold from Europe and some
small accretions of the precious metal from
other sources and the relaxed pressure by the
sub-treasury, added to the further contraction
of loans which has been made, a more favor
able showing is expected from the New York
banks ln the Saturday statement. But the
general outlook ln the money . market Is con
sidered . anything but favorable. The violent
upward movement of half a cent In the pound
sterling rate both for actual and posted rates
is regarded as an admonition that an easing
of the money rate here ls likely to lead to
a demand from London for gold.
It ls exceedingly significant that the Bank
of England parted with some $165,000 ln gold
to-day for shipment to Paris, which city has
been looked to from all points as the avail
able source for relief for the need of gold.
A financial upset in Italy had a disturbing
effect In all the European money markets.
The sharp upward movement here not only
ln sterling exchange but also ln French ex
change suggests a coming pressure on this
center.
The bond market was moderately light and
shows generally decline. Total sales, par
value. $1,650,000.
United States 2s advanced % and the new
4s (registered) declined % in the bid price.

Ninth Convention of the California
Miners' Association Will Meet
October 23â Adieu to Visit
ing Engineers.
The visiting members of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers were
scheduled to leave Los Angeles and the
State en their homeward journey last
Light, and now. since the meeting and
tour of this body is ended, the attention
of the miners of California has turned
to the annual State convention of the
California Miners' elation, which will
open In this city on the 23d Inst, and con
tinue several days.
The convention of this year now prom
ises to be the biggest and most Important
one in the -..' years of the associa
tion's history. Secretary E. H. Benja
min has returned from the Yosemite,
where he and other members of the as
sociation accompanied the visiting engi
neers, and Is busy with correspondence
and preparations concerning the conven
tion. He anticipates that there will be
several hundred delegates present. Of
the Governors of Pacific Coast states
who have been Invited to appoint dele
gates and thus make it practically a Pa
silic Coast convention which shall dis
cuss measures of general Importance to
the mining industry, two have already
responded. Governor Reinhold Sadler of
Neva and Governor Miguel Otero of
New Mexico have each forwarded the
names of ten delegates they have ap
pointed. A general representation of
Paclflc Coast States is already pretty
well assured and this and the business
Â«i the convention will m k- the me ting
of national importance. A cabinet uepart
ment of mines, the revision of Federal
mining laws and the conservation of
water will be among the subjects of dis
cussion, resolution and future aggressive
effort.
More interest Is being manifested in this
convention throughout the State than in
any previous one. A number of the
county associations have already chosen
their delegates. Placer County will send
.<-!, Nevada 60, Tuolumne 10, and others
in proportion
This year Hoards of Supervisors in coun
ties in which there is no organization have
been asked to appoint live delegates.
Among those that have already respond
ed are Madera, Marin and Fresno. New
county associations are expected to fol
low the convention.
The annual election of officers la ex- I
citing early interest. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Jacob H. Neff, who has been unani- '
mously re-elected .each year since the
beginning, declares positively that he will
not again accept the office. There has
been a general expectation that W. C
Halston. the vice president, will tx come
a candidate, and his friends expect to
place him in the chair. During the re
cent trip of the mining engineers ex-
Senator E. C. Voorl ; of Sutter Creek,
Amador County, who has been an active
member from the first, was put forward
as another possible candidate. The sec- j
retaryahip promises a lively contest. The
present energetic secretary, Edward 11. I
Benjamin, will no doubt be a candidate j
lor re-election, and will have good SUP
port- Other candidates have not yet
been definitely announced; but it is un
derstood that several would accept this I
office.
The siting engineers were escorted
into the Yosemite Valley by Secretary
Benjamin! J. E. Douglas, F. A. Leach and
wife, Charles G. Yale and wife and W. A.
Doble and wife. At Fresno on Tuesday
evening adieus were said during a big
impromptu meeting on the depot plat
form, and then the visitors went south,
escorted by L. E. Aubrey. H. Z. Osborne
and Professor Theodore B. Comstock of
the Southern California branch of the
California Miners' Association. At the
Fresno open-air love feast the Easterners
expressed enthusiastic thanks and ap
preciation for the hospitality and pleas
ures offered them by the miners of Cali
fornia, and there were cheers for Califor
nia and everybody in it. Professor N. W.
Lord of Ohio declared that the visit would
result in great good to California All
have agreed to sign a statement recording
their impressions of California and Its
mineral resources, which will be pub
lished In various journals.

ASQUITH PLEADS FOR
AMERICAN SYMPATHY
LONDON, Oct. 12.â Henry Herbert As
quith, former Home Secretary, speaking
at Newburgh this evening on the Trans
vaal situation and referring to the atti
tude abroad, said:
"The Americans have not forgotten,
and 1 believe they will not forget, the at
titude which this country, almost alone
among the nations, assumed toward them
recently when they were enduring times
of crisis and emergency similar to those
which seem now before us. The sympa
thy shown In those hours. of danger and
need engendered a warmth of gratitude,
and, I might say also, a tenderness of
sentiment which is no less genuine than
strong between the nations than between
Individuals.
"Looking backward two years there is
nothing which we have more reason to
congratulate ourselves upon; nothing that
has added more to our international as
sets than the fact that we established
this tie of affectionate reciprocal sympa
thy with our great kindred nation beyond
the Atlantic."
Lee Henry Courtney. Liberal member of
Parliament for the Bodwin division of
Cornwall, addressing his constituents at
Liskeard, was frequently interrupted. Mr.
Courtney lamented the failure of the
principles, enunciated at The Hague, and
In a lengthy criticism of the Government
policy declared that "our policy has been

to distrust us."
He said he did not believe the prevalent
Idea that there was a conspiracy to expel
the British from South Africa, and he re
gretted the Boer ultimatum, but said he
was unable honestly to condemn it.
After his speech Mr. Courtney was fol
lowed by hostile demonstrations.
The customary vote of confidence was
moved, but was met by an amendment,
which was adopted by a large majority,
expressing regret that Mr. Courtney
should be at variance with the Govern
ment's policy, and expressing complete
confidence In Lord Salisbury, j
Mr. Courtney, after the passage of the
amendment, said it was the first time he
had encountered a hostile vote, and he ad
mitted its gravity and seriousness.
The audience then sang "Rule Brltan

an auditorium for the University of Cal
ifornia is to be solved shortly by building
on an addition to the Harmon gymnas

The proposition to build the addition
will come up before a special meeting of
the Board of Regents to be : held next

gymnasium and add on a ipo-foot ex
tension. This will give the floor an area
of 170 feet by SO feet. A stage at one end
will be 34 by 30 feet. In the rear of this
will be dressing-rooms from | which an
entrance to the stage can jbe made.
A gallery eight feet wide will encircle the

FOUND STARVING ON THE
OAKLAND BLEAK MARSH
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â 0n the edge of the bleak marsh near the Sixteenth
street depot there was discovered to-day a little rag-carpet tent in
which was living Michael Kearny, aged 70, his wife, aged 40, and two
children, aged 10 and 6 years. The father, who is a veteran with an
honorable discharge, is in the last stages of consumption and is also
attacked with rheumatism, and is utterly incapable of working. His wife is
not strong and the whole family Is on the verge of starvation. They were
put out of their lodgings some weeks ago, and with only their old carpet for
a covering they built a little tent on a vacant lot. During the hot weather
their condition was not very intolerable, but when the storm arose yesterday
the tent cover was blown off, the heavy showers poured in and the cold wind
off the bay made their hovel more miserable.
To-day when visited by Mrs. Prescott of the Humane Society they were
absolutely without food. Supervisor Mitchell was notified and he at once
provided temporary relief. The parents will probably be sent to the County
Hospital and Mrs. Prescott will find homes for the children.

PRISONER SULLIVAN
A DESPERATE MAN
Threatened the Life of Warden Hale
of San Quentin.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 12.â Ex- Warden Hale
of San Quentin has been relieved of con
siderable worry. With the incarceration of
C. C. Sullivan, who was an accomplice
with Bert Willmore in the attempted
burglary, Sunday night, Mr. Hale feels
that he can walk the streets of Oakland
without expecting to see Sullivan spring
up from some secluded spot to take his
life.
During the time that Sullivan was serv
ing out part of his sentence at San Qucn
tin he formed a dislike for the Wacden
that gradually grew to bitter hatred. He
openly threatened to kill Hale If he ever
got the opportunity, and Hale, knowing
the man, did not doubt that he would do
it. Tuesday evening D. W. Martin of this
city met the ex-Warden at a Knight
Templars* meeting in Oakland, and Hale
told nim that it was the first night he had
been away from home since his return to
Oakland, -knowing that Sullivan was in
San Francisco and fear of him had kept
him from leaving his home after dark.
Â« "I am sincerely ...ad." said Hale, "that
you have him locked up securely in your
city prison, for now I can rest in peace
again. I told Budd after Sullivan's re
lease that he had made a mistake; that if
Sullivan did not kill me he would kill
some one else if he was at large long
enough."
Sullivan is one of the most desperate
Criminals ever confined in San Quentin; in
fact, his behavior was so bad that he had
to be transferred to Folsom. In August,
1891, he was the leader of a gang of des
perate fellows who plotted the murder of
the officials. One of the conspirators
"squaled," however, nnd thus probably
saved the lives of several guards. George
Welles, the man who informed on Sulli
van, was afterward nearly killed by the
latter, and was only saved by the cour
ageous act of a trusty.
Sullivan otherwise made a fairly good
record at Folsom, and two years ago his
sentence was commuted, so that he was
given his freedom on December 21, IS9B.
He said this morning that his sister-in
law, Mrs. Sullivan, was instrumental ln
securing his releaca. She was oniy a lb
tle -'-I when he was sent to prison and
did not know him until after her marriage
to his brother, but she worked almost un
ceasingly for several years for his par
don. She was a cousin to the late Warden
Aun and through the influence of that
gentlemen she succeeded in having Gov
ernor Budd pardon Sullivan. In speaking
of ex-Warden Hcie this evening, Sulli
van's face wore a look of bitter hate, and
his words matched his i<v .
"Hale is no good," said Sullivan. "Soon
after I went to San Quentin he began to
hound me. Aft. - ~. time, under those cir
cumstances, one ceases to be worth much
and gets desperate. I suppose Hale will
try to have me cinched for this trouble,
but they can't give me any more than life,
any way. I don't believe they will give
me thatâ l don't think they will use the
prior conviction in the charge." The time
for the prisoner's preliminary examina
tion has not yet been set.
The funeral of Bert Willmore took place
from Fowler's undertaking parlors this
afternoon at 2 o'clock. Mrs. Willmore and
Miss Ina Willmore, mother and sister of
the deceased, a brother of Mrs. Willmore
and a brother of the dead burglar's
father, were present with their wives.
Rev. E. P. Dennett made a short address
and offered prayer. A hack containing
the relatives and two other vehicles with
friends followed the remains to Mountain
View Cemetery, where the interment took
place.

DEATH OF WILLIAM,
WEIGHEL A PIONEER
OAKLAND, Oct, 12.â William Welghel,
whose funeral took place in this city, was
formerly a well-known mining man in
Nevada County. He came to California
in 1852 and later engaged in the hotel
business in Nevada. While in the Silver
State he was identified with political af
fairs, and represented Humboldt County
In the Legislature. He also held other
public offices. Failing health compelled
him to retire from business and come to
the bay, and after staying in San Fran
cisco and Ookland. he went to Ben
Lemond, where he died.
The deceased was a member of the Odd
Fellows' and of the Masonic order. He
leaves a widow, a son, W. McM Weighel,
and a daughter, Mrs. A. W. Rickard of
San Francisco. The funeral services
were conducted by Rev. E. Francis
Brown, and the remains were temporarily
placed in the receiving vault at Mountain
View. In accordance with the request of
the deceased his remains will be finally
interred in the family burial lot at San
Juan.
DENOUNCES THE SUIT
AS INFAMOUS OUTRAGE
Lieutenant Hayne of Heavy Artillery
Deplores the Action of One of
His Soldiers.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â Auent the suit filed
in San Francisco by John E. Talbot, Ed
ward E. Reynolds and W. A. Bourne, ask
ing for an accounting of the funds collect
ed for the reception and entertainment of
the California volunteers, First Lieuten
ant A. P. Hayne of Battery A, California
Heavy Artillery, in which Bourne was a
private, made the following statement to
night:
"I wish to go on record as denouncing
the suit filed by Talbot, Reynolds and
Bourne as an infamous outrage. Bourne,
who was a private in my battery, repre
sents himself alone. I firmly believe that
1 can say without fear of contradiction
that nine-tenths of our organization wish
to be left out of this affair entirely. And
I believe also that if judgment should be
obtained by the plaintiffs none except
Bourne would take anything by it. The
suit is particularly infamous when we
take into consideration the glorious and
unprecedented reception we were ten
dered, a reception that far outclassed our
most sanguine expectations. And it is
very wrong for a private, who really
never did very much in our battery, to
rope us into such an outrageous scheme.
If there is to be arty kick about the money
collected for the great reception, let those
who gave the money kick over the dis
position of the residue; but God forbid
that a soldier who enjoyed the hospitality
on that memorable occasion should be
among the kickers." â ._';-*"â -"

Bitter Contest Over
the Cook Estate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 12.
The trial of an interesting suit wherein
a big estate is at issue was commenced
before Superior Judge Greene to-day, ar.d
promises to occupy several days. The
suit is that of Richard Kimball and other
heirs of Elizabeth L. Cook, deceased,
against the latter's_ husband's former
business partner, W. G. 3 ripp, whereby
the Cook heirs seek to have annulled and
canceled certain deeds to valuable real
estate, aggregating over $20,000 at the
least estimate.
From the complaint originally filed in
the suit it appears that shortly prior to
her death some years ago Mrs. Cook,
when about to undergo a surglc. 1 opera
tion, and fearing fatal consequences, con
veyed her entire estate to Tripp, her de
ceased husband's former partner, with In
structions to give certain portions of it
to persons she named at the time, and
for Tripp to retain the balance. Under
this disposition many of the closest rela
tives were practically ignored. .
After her death William H. Knight,
then Public Administrator, applied for
and was granted letters of administration
on Mrs. Cook's estate, and thereupon the
relatives began contests to recover such
shares of her property as they would
have been entitled to had she died in
testate and without leaving any provision
for the disposition of the estate. As a
result of those contests about $20,000 in
money was recovered from Tripp, but not
without a most bitter legali battle that
concluded only In the Supreme Court.
The present suit Involves the question
of ownership of the realty which Mrs.
Cook conveyed by deed *o Tripp, and
promises to be as bitterly fought as were
the preceding suits.
On the side of Mrs. Cot's heirs are
arraigned as counsel Joseph Campbell,
Nusbaumer & Reed and Fred E. Whitney,
while Tripp is represented by Cary
Howard and Welles Whitmore.
GAMBLING DEVICES
NOT USED IN CHURCHES
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â nlckel-in-the
slot machines are again causing agita
tion to the city government. Council
man Girard's statement last night that
they are on a par with church fairs and
entertainments, and that all should be
taxed alike, or ignored, is contradicted
by Councilman Barstow. %&>â 's
"I am not a bigot." said Mr. Barstow,
to-day, "but when Mr. Girard said last
night that there was not a church in
Oakland but what is running gambling
games, I challenged his remark. He
named his own church, and I requested
him to speak for his own crowd and let
others alone. I hold that everybody
should be secured, both In their religious
and political rights, and that they should
be protected from persecution or ridicule
concerning them."
City Attorney Dow having reported
that under the State law the machines
are undoubtedly gambling devices, the
City Council will request the Mayor to
order the Chief of Police to make some
arrests, and see If the police court jurors
will convict.

MAY SUE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS
No Returns for Money
Expended.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 12.â The Supervisors 01
Santa Clara County will shortly be asked
to refund $800 to the county out of their
private purses for funds which, it is al
leged, were practically thrown away on
an unpublished special edition of a local
paper. The Taxpayers' League, which is
keeping a strict watch on county affairs,
is said to have the matter in hand.
Furthermore, it is proposed to ask Super
visors Stern, Rea, Roll and Austin to pay
into the county $200 each, and if it in not
done the matter will be laid before the
next Grand Jury.
On July 24 last H. H. Main, then pro
'' prietor of the Evening Herald, appeared
before the Board of Supervisors and
' asked for an appropriation of $1200 to aid
in getting out a special edition adver
tising the resources of Santa Clara Coun
ty. The board voted him $800. At the
> time negotiations were pending by which
Charles M. Shortridge was to become
owner of the Herald. On August 3
1 Main's claim for $800 was allowed. Super
visors Rea and Stern, of the Auditing
i Committee, signing the claim. Main
drew the money but made no attempt
i to get out a special edition and none was
ever published. Supervisors Roll, Austin,
Rea and Stern were present at the meet
ing when the Herald was allowed the $800
and all voted In favor of the appropria
; tion.
The opinion is exnressed that the four
Supervisors voting away this money can
i be held responsible, as no special edition
lof the Herald was ever Issued. Steps are
: to be taken to have the money refunded
j to the county.

PLEA FOR PARTY SOLIDITY.
Reichstag Members Address the So-
cialist Conference.
HANOVER, Oct. 12.â At to-day's session
of the socialists' conference Herren Aver
and Wallmar, members of the Reichstag,
made speeches in which they sought to
arrest the separatist tendency arising
from the divergence of opinion respecting
the theories of socialism and appealed
to their hearers to recognize the necessity
for party solidity.
Both speakers, while to some extent
defending Bernstein, announced their in
tention to support Herr Bebel's resolu
tion of October 10, declaring that the
party shall remain what it is, namely, a
Class party, of which the historical aim
is to acquire political supremacy, and
that there is no reason why the party
should alter Its programme, tactics or
name.
OFFICERS ESCAPE CENSURE.
Cruiser Newark. Court of Inquiry
Report Reaches Washington.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â report of
the court inquiry which investigated the
circumstances under which the cruiser
Newark exhausted her coal and was for a
time in peril in the Straits of Magellan
has been received at the Navy Depart
ment and Is under examination. The in
quiry was had at the Mare Island Navy
Yard, and although the result has not yet
been made public officially it Is gathered
that the court found that no further pro
ceedings were necessary beyond the Issue
of an order to commanding officers to take
special care and ascertain the exact state
of their coal bunkers before going on long
voyages.

SUPERIOR JUDGE
MAY RESIGN
F. M. Angellotti Tires of
His Office.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 12.â A rumor which
has been in circulation for several days
past that Superior Judge F. M. Angellotti
would shortly resign his seat on the
bench to fill the vacancy at the bar
caused by the death of Attorney Hepburn
Wilkins received authentic verification
this evening. The resignation will prob
ably take place within two weeks and it
is understood that ex-District Attorney
E. B. Martinelli will be appointed to the
Superior Judgeship.
Attorney Wilkins filled a peculiar posi
tion in local legal circles and had an
extensive practice, his income being very
large.
Judge Angellotti's salary is $4000 a year,
and as he is deemed the, only logical
candidate for the deceased lawyer's
clientele it will easily be seen that a
resignation at this time means consider
able to him along financial lines. It is
definitely known that a few days ago
Judge Angellotti, Attorney Martinelli and
one or two others held a conference look
ing to a resignation. While such a move
on the part of his Honor is admitted on
all sides to be both logical and expedient
there are many who doubt if his physical
constitution will be strong enough to
stand the added confinement and mental
change inevitable to the change. Judge
Angellotti has twice beer elected to the
office he now holds and his second term
will not expire until 'January 1, 1900.
Previously to his Incumbency as Superiot
Judge he was District Attorney.
Ex-District Attorney James W. Coch
rane Is also said to be in the race for
the Superior Judgeship.
Judge Angellotti, -when seen last night
at the Occidental Hotel, would neither
confirm nor deny the rumor, saying that,
at the present time, he preferred not to
discuss the matter in any way whatever.

GRAND JURY AFTER CORRUPT
SCHOOL DIRECTORS.
Â«
J>r. Gedge and His Partner Went Be
fore the Inquisitors to Protest
Their Innocence Without
Being Summoned.
The Grand Jury is determined to get at
the bottom of the Board of Education
scandal, if such a thing ls possible, and
if present indications count for anything
it is more than likely that indictments
will bo found against at least two mem
bers of that body for accepting bribes
from firms furnishing supplies to the
School Department. The energy displayed
by the members of the Grand Jury in
investigating the charges of corruption
that have been made against Gedge and
Conlon has started shivers of apprehen
sion chasing up and down the spinal col
umns of that unsavory pair, while Di
rector Kemp's disgust at the manner in
which lit- was bunkoed out of what he
considered his share of the "boodle" has
been succeeded by a fear that he may
also be Indicted.
Yesterday these three worthies rushed
panic-stricken before the Grand Jury,
each for himself, to testify to his indi
vidual honesty, In their anxiety, however,
they overreached themselves. They had
not been subpenaed, and If they were in
nocent they could have trusted their fate
safely in the hands of the Grand Jury;
but reason was blinded by the knowledge
t>f their dangerous position, and they tried
a plan that may, alter all, prove their un
doing.
Their actions while waiting in the ante
room for an opportunity to be heard were
suspicious to the last degree. They sat
in one corner of the room for more than
an hour conferring in whispers that is,
i ledge and Cordon did. Kemp was there
part of the time, but his nerves were on
edge, and frequent visits to near-by dis
aries of "grocers" were necessary to
keep up his flagging courage. But Kemp
never got .- chance to protest his pureness
of art and purpose before the Inquis
itors, for by tne time that body had fin
ished with the other two it was ti p. m.,
and an adjournment was taken.
Conlon was the first to be called. He
entered the Grand Jury room with his
little story of how he had been vilified
and abused on the tip of his tongue, but
he had not been under fire five minutes
before the weakness of his defense was
apparent to the most obtuse Juryman in
the roomâ and the Grand Jury is com
posed of an exceptionally intelligent
body of men. Conlon's discomfiture was
caused by his reference to the purchase
from C. F. Weber & Co. of a $10,000 lot
of desks for the School Department.
What has become of JSOOO worth of these
desks Is one of the things that the Grand
Jury is desirous of knowing. Kemp was
asked the question, but claimed he did
not know. He could not tell whether the
desks had ever been received, or If re
ceived how distributed, notwithstanding
the fact that he is and was at the time !
the purchase was made chairman of the
committee on supplies. In fact, so far as
his knowledge went the desks are as com- i
pletely lost as though they had never j
existed.
Dr. Gedge was next given a chance to
clear himself and went to the task with
an assurance worthy of a better cause.
He protested solemnly that he had never
received $2000 nor any other sura as a
bribe, and sought to convince the jurors
of the absurdity of such an assumption
by quoting the price paid for the station
ery supplies, which would preclude the
possibility of the successful bidder pay
ing such a large commission. He did
not attempt to explain where the $8000
worth of desks had gone, however. Dur
ing the course of his testimony Gedge at
tributed his accusation to the animosity
of George Walker, the man to whom he
confessed the acceptance of a $2000 bribe.
In addition to the two directors several
other witnesses were examined, but their
testimony was unimportant. C. S. Bene
dict appeared to testify to the good char
acter of Dr. Gedge, although he had not
been subpenaed as a witness. J. Curtis,
tenting the firm of Payot, Upham &
Co., and C. M. Wiggins, representing the
firm of the Whitaker & Ray Company,
testified in regard to certain supplies fur
nished the department.
The Grand Jury will hold a special ses
sion this afternoon and evening to fur
ther investigate the School Department
scandal.
Bazaar of St. Brendan's Church.
Well merited success has attended St.
Brendan's Church fair which is now in
progress. The excellence of the enter
tainments given each evening has made
the fair popular with the pleasure-seek
ing public and as a result the attendance
has been large. The Inclemency of the
â¢weather last evening did not have the ef
fect of diminishing the attendance. The
programme was under the direction of the
Ladies of the Children of Mary booth
and the church choir booth and contained
many pleasing features. The fair is
scheduled to close to-morrow night, but
It is possible tbrtt It may be continued
several days next week.

GLORIOUS CLIMATE ABDICATES
IN FAVOR OF REAL WEATHER
MANY San Franciscans believed
yesterday that it was raining.
Never were they more mistaken
in their lives. The hot wave
of last Sunday had merely
reached high heaven and made the
angels weep. Of course it would
be impopslble to force Forecaster
McAdie to admit any such thing. -
He insists that the downpour was
caused by a low temperature re
sultant from the collision of a storm
from Mexico with one from the north.
And a mighty mean low temperature
It must have been to spoil such an
angelic theory. Catch a well-bred min
imum or maximum temperature doing
anything of the sort! Never! Only
the lowest of low temperatures could
descend to such depths.
This one, at any rate, according to
McAdie, was caused primarily by the
storm from the republic to the south.
It blew up through the pepper patches
and the tamale beds at a great veloc
ity, getting hotter and hotter as it
came. It struck San Francisco in the
midribs and made it groggy. The luck
less city reeled to its corner, perspir
ing at every pore, faintly calling for
the iceman.
Out from the north there was some
thing charging for a reckoning with
the hot wave. A very Southern Pacific
of a storm, bound to bump into some
thing, was gathering from the glaciers,
and when it started it brought with It
a wave as cold as a 5 o'clock tea. The
two waves met Tuesday night, head
on, just beyond the bar. The collision
was terrific, and water was thrown all
over the adjacent ocean and Marin
County. A little of the sprinkle ar
rived here the same evening, but the
real thing came yesterday morning,
descending first in a tattoo of hall and
later descending in an air-purifying,
eewer-flushlng noonday shower.
WARDEN VACANCY AT
FOLSOM STATE PRISON
TWO REPUBLICAN APPLICANTS
FOR THE POSITION.
Directors Will Meet To-Morrow at the
Prisonâ Report That a Dem
ocrat Will Be Chosen.
The Board of State Prison Directors
will meet at Folsom to-morrow and con
sider the subject of selecting a Warden
to fill the vacancy caused by the death
of Charles Aull. The directors have de
cided to appoint a Democrat, holding that
a custom long established is, in effect, an
unwritten law, and that the Warden at
Folsom shall be a Democrat if the War
den at â¬an Quentln is a Republican.
Warden Aull, a Democrat, held office for
three terms. Owing to the favorable in
fluence of Irwin C. Stump, who was chair
man of the Republican State Central
Committee in the campaign which culmin
ated in the election of H. H. Markham as
Governor, Mr. Aull was retained in office
throughout a Republican administration.
No change, of course, was made when
Governor Budd came into power, and no
change was contemplated, so far as can
be ascertained, by the present administra-
I tion.
There are two Republican aspirants for
the wardenshlp. Ex-Sheriff Thomas Cun
ningham of San Joaquin has many strong
backers for the place. Ex-Sheriff Mark
B. Ivory of Contra Costa County ls in
; dorsed for the position by many prom
inent Republicans. The Prison Directors
have not announced the name of a Demo
crat for the place, but the announcement
will no doubt be made at the meeting to
morrow.

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1899.
It has knocked the hot wave Into
smithereens; the glorious climate of
California has become weather, and
Forecaster McAdie says it will remain
as unsettled as tailors' bills until an
other period of high temperature hap
pens along from God knows where.
The downpour has been general
throughout the State and Arizona,
while in Nevada and Utah it has been
snowing on Indians and Mormons. The
precipitation was somewhat heavier
than is usual in October, and the ac
companying cold snap might have
caused serious damage to fruit grow
ers had not Forecaster McAdie grasped
the situation as he did and sent out
warnings in ample time for growers
and dryers to protect the matured
crops.
In Arizona the downpour was even
heavier than in California, 2.32 inches
falling at Flagstaff up to 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. The Nevadans
and Salt Lakers are the people who
are getting it. One day they got the
warning that something was coming,
md the next day It snowed.
O'Rourke sang a contralto solo; Miss
Beronio gave a selection on the piano
and the "fan" chorus proved to be a
great attraction. St. Rose's booth was
handsomely decorated with flags on the
exterior and with cut flowers, potted
plants and bric-a-brac in the interior.

Mike Hopkins, a hodcarrier, about CO
years of age, employed on a building in

MADE ATTORNEY FOR
COAST BUSINESS MEN
Attorney E. S. Pillsbury.
EBEN S. PILLSBURY will represent. in a legal capacity, the whole
salers and Jobbers and manufacturers of the Pacific Coast before the
Interstate Commerce Commission in St. Louis next month. This was
decided upon, yesterday and the vote of the Pacific Coast Traffic As
sociation's executive committee was unanimous ln the selection. The
hearing on rates, differentials and terminals will take place on November
18. Mr. Pillsbury is not supposed to know as much about rate matters as
the merchants and jobbers, and representatives of the Traffic Association
who have made a study, of rates and all that appertains to them will also
go to St. Louis. Mr. Loveland, the chairman of the Traffic Association's ex
ecutive committee, and W. R. Wheeler are certain to go. While It is true
that the decision of the Interstate Commission is final in one sense of the
word there is here a Belief that the matter may ultimately get into the
Supreme Court, of the United States in some shape. Mr. Pillsbury will
guard the legal interests of the coast. Mr. Pillsbury's selection was made
by a sub-committee and waa then ratified by the full committee. The ex
ecutive committee also named Frank Brown, representing the steel and
wire Interest, and Charles F. Tay of the George H. Tay Company as a sub
committee to visit Los Angeles and confer with the wholesalers and Job
bers and manufacturers concerning the work of organizing the business men
of the coast. |
Forecaster McAdie was not prepared
yesterday afternoon to predict the
limit of the present storm. He is of
the opinion that it will sweep to the

Texas and Louisiana with heavy rains.

Republicans are preparing for the ratifi

was reported in one of the dally papers
recently that the Democratic ratification
meeting would be held at Metropolitan
Hall on Saturday evening of this week,
but the Republicans have engaged the hall
for that evening, and they hold a receipt
for the prepaid rent.
No doubt Democrats will be cordially
welcomed by their fellow-citizens of Re
publican faith. Democrats could not nut
their time to better use than in listening
for a half-hour to the plain language of
that exemplary citizen the Hon. Horace
Davis.
The registration, which closed last
night, renders it certain that a very
large vote will be cast at the municipal
election. A large registration Is always
indicative of Republican success. There
is a marked change of public sentiment in
favor of Mr. Davis. Republicans who
were debating the question last week
whether they should cast another ballot
for Mr. Pheian have settled the problem
by resolving to support Mr. Davis, be
cause he is the Republican nominee and
in every other respect worthy of the in
dorsement of the people of San Francisco.
When Mayor Pheian happens to be cam
paigning in Republican districts he is
very anxious that national issues and
party topics should not he discussed In a
local contest. When addressing a Demo
cratic audience at Metropolitan Hall he
takes another view of the subject. When
he was advertised to address a Demo
cratic mass meeting in this city on August
4 The Call fancied that he would "slop
over," and therefore engaged an expert
stenographer to report his speech ver
batim. The Mayor, with the assistance
of an evening paper, is now trying to
square that speech with subsequent ut
terances, but the matter is not adjustable.
Another extract from the Mayor's Dem
ocratic speech on that occasion may in
terest Republican voters. The Mayor
said: "The old Democratic party that
came down from Jefferson has traditions
which appeal to us all. It has always
been the closest party to the people. And
when Mr. Lane says he Is surprised that
the Republican party has not at any
time inspired the confidence of the peo
ple, notwithstanding that it had with It
such men as Abraham Lincoln, he can
be easily answered when we tell him
that the personnel of the party is com
posed unfailinglyâ and you see it In this
city â of the men who prey upon the pub
lic revenues and avoid their share of
taxation and who subsist upon special
privileges. You can't regenerate the Re
publican party In municipal affairs for
that reason."
When Horace Davis speaks of living
national issues in which every citizen is
concerned Mayor Pheian calls him a
traitor to the charter, but shades of
Monticello, Pheian can bring out Thomas
Jefferson and the early century traditions
of the Democratic party and no one for
that challenges his loyalty to the spirit
of the new charter. In the name of con
science one may ask what Mayor Pheian
means by this Jeffersonian diversion.
The charge made by the Mayor that
the Republican party is composed unfail
ingly of men who avoid their share of
taxation was unwarranted, unjust and
untrue. Republican tax payers may re
sent it at the polls on November 7.
The enrollment of voters in the Horace
Davis Central Club Is progressing rapid
ly. The organization promises to exert
great influence in the cause of good gov
ernment.
Members of the Democratic County
Committee have been notified to attend
the Initial meeting of that body at B'nai
B'rith Hall to-night.
A Democratic ratification meeting will
be held next Monday night at Metro
politan Temple for the purpose of indors
ing the nominees of the late Democratic
convention. '

SALASSA IS
SUBLIME AS
DON CARLOS
npHOSE who heard "Ernani" at the Ti-
THOSE who heard "Ernani" at that so
voli last night will concede that so
I far Salassa's Don Carlos, King of
Spain, was the best work this full
fledged artist has done in this city. Pos
sessing a truly royal stage presence, com
manding a kingly deportment and being
the lucky owner of a barytone the equal
of which is seldom heard on any operatic
stage, it may easily be imagined that Sa
lassa's King Carlos was a dramatic cre
ation over which the most blase music
lovers may well go into ecstasies. His solo
toward the end of the fourth act was
most assuredly a masterful vocal effort,
not alone because of the rare quality of
the voice, but also because of the care
and, may I say, science of execution. Sa
lassa's success is by no means restricted to
his vocal triumphs, but his dramatic tem
perament, his painstaking adherence to
elocutionary effect and his realistic mim
icry combine to make him a king in his
element.
While the lion's share of the success
must be accorded to Salassa, because his
is the most responsible role of the play, it
would be unfair to withhold praise from
the other artists whose assistance was
necessary to complete the performance.
Avedano had no opportunity to exhibit
the full scope of his ability until the last
act, where he showed his worth in a duet
and a trio. Anna Lichter, too, had not
very much chance to display her advan
tages and it is so much more credit to her
that she made very much of her part and
did the little with that care and polish
which mark all her operatic work. G. S.
Wanrell, after a rest of several weeks,
came once more to the front and con
vinced his listeners that his delightful
basso cantante becomes an ornament to
the cast because he knows so well how to
use it to advantage, and because his
method of singing is strictly in accord
ance with the principles of true art. His
Don Silva was exquisite.
But the grandest part of last night's
performance was the finale of the fourth
act, where the chorus showed its utmost
strength. It received five curtain calls.
Max Hirschfeld and his splendid orches
tra contributed their invaluable aid. Â«_nd
now I have written another eulogy orr the
Tivoli Grand Opera Company, but what
will you? It is true eulogies, when too
often repeated, become tiresome. But it
is not my fault that the Tivoli has such
an excellent company that an adverse
criticism would be defamatory. "Ernani"
will be repeated on Saturday and Sunday
evenings. This evening "Satanella" will
be repeated ALFRED METZGER.
ARGONAUTS AT PLAY.
Forty-Niners Enjoy a Reunion at
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Oct. 12.â Just fifty years
ago to-day seventy-nine argonauts, all
residents of Cayuga County. N. V.. who
had formed the Cayuga Joint Stock Com
pany, whose purpose was the Quest of
gold in the hills and rivers of the Golden
State, disembarked in San Francisco after
a stormy ocean voyage of 226 days in the
good old bark Belvldera, which facetiously
has been described by the venerable
Captain Samuel Barney as being forty
feet long, forty feet wide and forty feet
deep. So far as known there are but
ten survivors of that band and six of
these to-night celebrated the fiftieth an
niversary of the event of their disem
barkment, Timothy L. Barker, the re
tired merchant, residing at 1119 Castro
street, being the host of the occasion.
The Barker mansion was brilliantly Il
luminated and the decorations were su
perb. Over the main entrance floated a
huge silk American flag. On the banquet
table, around which the whetted appe
tites of the survivors were satiated with
the best of delicacies that money could
buy, stood a floral miniature of the bark
Belvidera and toasts were drunk to past
and present as well as the next anni-
versary.
The six surviving Argonauts were Timo
thy L. Barker, the host; William M.
Eddy the banker of Santa Barbara;
Werthing S. Lyon, who for the past forty
years has been foreman in the melting
department of the Selby Lead and Smelt
ing Works, San Francisco; Andrew J.
Haight of Alameda, formerly for years
with the old firm of Moffatt and Com
pany, the earliest coiners of San Fran
cisco, and afterward an assayer -with
Keilogg, Huston & Co., predecessors of
the present Selby Smelting Works; Dr.
William A. Grover. retired physician and
oldest of the sextet; Hiram T. Graves,
lormerly with Moffatt & Co., later in the
United States Assayer's office, San Fran
cisco Mint, and at present secretary of
the Mount Olive Cemetery Association.
They were accompanied by their wives.
The combined ages of the six argonauts
is 445 years. The other four survivors,
who have since returned to Cayuga
County, New York, and from whom
greetings were received, are Dr. Oscar,
D. Munson, dentist; Weston A. Ogaen,
retired merchant: John Choate, hard
ware dealer, and George Richardson,
furniture dealer. Among those present
to-nlght as representatives of a younger
generation were Senator George C. Per
kins, Congressman Victor Metcalf, ex-
Mayor W. R. Davis and Colonel John P.
Irish, who extended greeting to.^ the
guests of the occasion. During the In
terims between the spicy speeches, yarns
and reminescenses, . music was rendered
by Miss Annie Herrick, violinist; "Miss
Bertha Marvin, soloist, and Esta Marvin,
pianist, and the evening closed by the
company pinging "Auld Lang Syne, and
a sentiment to the next anniversary.
Each guest was presented with a sou
venir in the way of a miniature p'.ck,
shovel and pan. and each lady received a
little bucket of so-called nuggets.
Run Down by a Cable Car.
John Gerbes, a crippled cigar-dealer,
was knocked down last night by a west
bound cable car at the corner of Eighth
and Market streets, and sustained a se
vere laceration of the right cheek and a
bruised eye. Eyewitnesses claim that the
gnpman failed to ring his bell. Gerbes
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where hi? wounds were dressed by Dr.
Dray.
Wet Weather at the Chutes.
Nearly 2000 persons visited the Chutes
last night, despite the wet weather, and
the management, wanting to show its
appreciation, opened its larder, gave
away ice cream, candies, popcorn and
everything of an edible description. â¢
Registration Closes.
Registration closed last night. Up to
midnight 1451 persons had registered for
the day. and 1207 changes of residence
were recorded.
The total number of voters who regis
tered this year is 70,415, as against 62,456.
