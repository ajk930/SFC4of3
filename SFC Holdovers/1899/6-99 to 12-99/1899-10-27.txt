BRITISH WARSHIPS ARE CHASING A RUSSIAN
STEAMER CARRYING ARMS FOR BOERS
In Addition to the Serious Predicament
of Her Troops in Natal England Seems
to Be in a Fair Way of Causing Inter=
esting Foreign Complications.
MALTA, Oct. 27 âThe British battleship Anson, cruiser Hawk
and destroyer Bruizer have sailed in chase of a Russian steamship
carrying arms for the Boers via Suez Canal.
PARIS, Oct. 27.â A dispatch to the Journal from Toulon says
there is talk there of sending to the southwest coast of Africa a
naval division consisting of three second-class protected cruisers,
commanded by admiral Bienaime
L-OXDOX, Oct. 27.â Although tho dis
patches sent from the front are"
contradictory three or four main
facts stand out prominently. Gen
eral Symons 1 fight at Glencoe was
not anything like tho decisive victory at
first alleged, and General Yule would In
all probability have been annihilated or
have met with the same fate as the cap
tured Hussars if ho had not retreated.
General White's artillery duel at Reit
fontein was a very severe engagement, in
â¢which the rifle did (Treat execution and
which success was also achieved at a dis
tressing cost.
The bombardment of Mafeking has com
menced with unknown result and the
Boers have got their Hussar prisoners
pafely u> Pretoria.
Altogether the campaign is being pushed
by the "Boers so strenuously and on such
Found strategical lines that the situation
of the British must in all probability give
them cause for anxiety for some time to
come. .
It is difficult to see how the concen
trated force at Ladysnilth will be able to
take the aggressive immediately. Apart
from the fatigue, regiments like the Gor
don Highlanders and Rival Rifles have
been practically without officers since the
fights and 135 additional officers have been
ordered to leave England as speedily as
possible.
fÂ» official announcement of the join
if General White and General Yule
come as a great relief, and all the
more so In view of the fact that .later
dispatches have shown .that only the in
capacity of the Intelligence department of
the Boers saved General .Yule's column
from a great disaster.
It seems thaf on Friday night Dundee
was full of alarms. Heavy firing was
hÂ«~ard at 1 o'clock nd again at 4. . A se
v,to thunderstorm soon after stopped the
liner cannonade. Saturday --.â â ; in the
same anxious manner, in momentary ex
pectation of an attack. The British finally
evacuated, taking. all that they could, but
leaving plenty behind for the Boers to
loot." â "
Th? appointments of the Boer hospital
at Dundee are described as very primi
tive. - The Boers themselves, in the ab
sence of a nursing staff, get 'only scant
attention.
It is reported General Sir William Perm
Symons died on Wednesday â not on
Thursdayâ and was buried at Dundee yes-
General Yule's column had a very ex
â¢hausting march, chiefly, it is believed, by
r.lght. The reason of a night march is
not given, but it was probably a fear of
Boer surprises. Th.' heavy rains and mist
hampered the march, but were perhaps
the means of saving General Yule from
molestation. It took the column twenty
four hours to cover the last sixteen miles.
The only news this morning consists of
a more detailed account of the battles al
ready reported. A correspondent who has
visited the hospital at IJadysiriitli! where
the Boors wounded at Elands Laagte who
were captured, are being tended, reports
that General Jan Ko'ck, who was badly
w minded In the thigh and shoulder.,,
the advance.of the patrol under Comman
dant Pienar without guns was simply
with the object of cutting the railway,
and that this body was .subsequently re
inforced without General Joubert's orders,
G^nr-nl Viljnf-n accompanying them. The
latter was killed early in the fight.
According to another correspondent the
Boers say that General Kock, during the
battle, read his Bible and" prayed for vic
tory. His brother, 'two sons and a nephew
â¢were all wounded and taken prisoners.
(Colonel Schiel of the German corps and
Commandant retorius were both severely
wounded. Many prominent Boers are not
yet accounted for. Philip Kock says the
Boers suffered most from "soldiers In lit
tle clothesâ half men and half women"â
meaning the Gordon Highlanders, and in
tho charge of the Fifth Lancers. They
say also that the quick-firing guns cap
tured by the Devonshire Regiment are
those that were taken from the Jameson
raiders.
Colonel Bchiel assured a correspondent
that nothing could stand against the ac
curacy of the British field guns, which re
peatedly drove the Transvaal gunners
from their embrasures. The British in
fantry lire was also, he said, a complete
surprise to the Boers, who were confident
of their ability to master any infantry at
tack.
One Elands Laagte correspondent ex
presses the belief that the British killed
fewer Boers than might have been ex
pected considering the heavy fire of the
British artillery.
The bullet of the Boer Mausers, It ap
pears, makes a clean, healthy wound
where It passes out. No operations for
extraction have been necessary at the
Ladysmltb hospital.
With regard to the western frontier it is
reported that President Steyn recently
visited a force of 2000 Boers encamped ten
miles south of Kimberley.
The war is having Its natural effect in
Cape Colony. Everything is at famine
prices and horseflesh is at a tremendous
premium.

took on six wagons loaded with their

RESOLUTIONS
FOR MEDIATION
ARE PRESENTED.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2H.â The resolu
tions adopted at a mass-m.eting held in
Carnegie Hall. Now York, October 11,
urging the President to offer the friendly
services of the United States in mediation
between Groat Britain and the Transvaal
and the Orange Free State republics,
were presented to the President this after
| noon by a delegation from New York
, headed by Tunis G. Hergin. president of
the Holland Society. The delegation also
j Included Alfred H. Love of Philadelphia,
president of the Universal Peace Union.
Mr. Bergin, in his address presenting
j the petition to the President, said ihe
delegation had no desire to embarrass the
friendly relations between the United j
States and Great Britain. On the con
trary, it was because of that friendliness j
and good understanding that they pre
sented the petition to the President lii the
hope that in the wise ami good discretion
of the executive, a way might be found to
offer the timely offices of the Government
of the United States in an endeavor to
allay the bloody conflict now gojng on in
Africa. This would be in line with the
new diplomacy enunciated at The Hague
peace conference. The hope was <:x
--pressed 'that honorable terms of peace
might be secured, the honor of both
parties be sustained, and th<> names of
two of our sister republics not be stricken
from thÂ» earth. No pc Â»ple would welcome
our giMxl offices like the English people.
â  | the South African republics were ready
for mediation, and the United States, as
the friend of both, should be the best
mediator.
The President, ln responding, thanked the
gentlemen present for appearing and for
! the sentiments expressed in behalf of
peace. Such sentiments had ..is sym
pathy, but In a case where so many di
verse interests are Involved, moves must
be made with great reserve, lest, unwit
tingly, injury be done some of the. parties.

looked that America had Interests at
Stake. The President reiterated that he
was for peace, and assured the delegation
thai the petition would receive his most
earnest consideration.
BULLER EXPECTED SUNDAY.

awaiting eagerly the arrival of General
Redvers Buller, who Is expected on Sun

the front, thus avoiding a march through
I the city and Inevitable demonstrations.
CORDON ABOUND KIMBERLEY
LONDON, Oct. 2Câ There Is little news

The Portuguese authorities have recon

white and black prisoners, whom the
isoers released from their Jails and turned
loose in Portuguese territory.
This little city, often called the Aldorshot of South Africa, is at this time the center of interest for both the Boers and the British. With the addition of
General Yule's forces from Glencoe and Dundee to those of General White, already on. the ground, there are now in and about the place between twelve and thir
teen thousand British troops, while approaching it. and by this time probably investing it, on the north and east, are the Boers under General Joubert, who forced
General Yule from Dundee, .and fought General White at Elands Laagte and Kietfontein, and on the west and southwest from Van Reenans, and other passes in
th.- I>rakensbi'rÂ»r. the Orange Free State forces, making together an aigrette exceeding the British force by several thousand, with a good complement of field
pieces. besides ihf Ijeavy, long-distance guns used in the last attack on Dundee. On the hills about L,adyamith the. British have, also a number of heavy guns, so

HOW THE BRITISH
WERE DRIVEN BACK
TO LADY SMITH
Deadly Aim of the Boers That
Materially Thinned the Ranks
of the Retreating Troops.
LONDON, Oct. 2r>.â The War Of
fice has received the following dis
patch from General White:
"LADYSMITH, Oct. 26. 12:+") p. m.â
General Yule's column has just
marched in here after a very hard
march during a night of exception
ally heavy rain. The men, though
done up, are in, good spirits and
only want a rest. The enemy did
not molest them."
The War Office has received a
telegram from General White,
dated Ladysmith. Thursday, giving
a list of the captured officers of
Hussars, etc., as cabled to the As
sociated Press yesterday. General
While explained that he did not
have the iist until General Yule's
foVce arrived to-day and adds that
he understood they were all alive,
but prisoners.
LONDON, Oct. 2(s.â Details of the
fighting at Reitfontein are coming
in slowly. A special dispatch from
Ladysmlth, dated October 24, filed
after the light, says:
"On discovery that the Boers were
massed to the westward of the main road
to Dundee an attempt .was made by a
train to recover the body of Colonel Scqtt-
Chtsholm, killed at Elands Laagte. The
train was tired upon and obliged to retire,
and General White moved out to attack
the Boers believed to be Free Staters who
should have joined the Transvaalers at

strong ridge, whence they opened fire at
roo yards, hitting several British. In the
meanwhile the Hussars and Natal Car
bineers advanced unscathed through an
opening in the ridge under fire of a Boer
gun? while the Imperial Light Horse took
part of the crest of the hill, the Boers
re "At n fbout 9 o'clock a Boer gun stationed
on the crest of Matawanaskop opened fire
with great accuracy on the main force,
which in the meantime had come up. but
the shells failed to explode and the Brit
ish artillery silenced the opposition. The
whole British force then advanced and
the action became general. A large body
of Boers occupied strong positions at
Matawanaskop and the precipitous ridges
surrounding it. The British guns held the
position and the infantry advanced under
the fire. The Gloilcesters and Devons
crossed a fearful fire zone beneath Tuitan
yoni hill, whence the Boers poured a
withering fire with such effect that thirty
of the attackers dropped in a distance of
200 yards.
"Seeing the peril of the Devons and
Gloucesters, General -White dispatched the
Carbineers and Liverpools to take the
enemy in the rear. A fierce rifle and ar
tillery duel was maintained ior some
time. The British Maxims rattled, but the
Boers, under cover of the rocks, remained
cool and replied with an- incessant rifle
fire. The. British artillery swept the face

treated to another ridge, whence they
were dislodged by the volunteers In the
face of a galling fire.
"The Boers soon reformed and took up
a position oil another ridge, but the volun

eau, again rushed the Boer position and
drove them back to the main force, oc
cupying Matawanasknp. The British then
shelled the latter until clusters of Boers
were seen leaving and retreating west
ward when the engagement closed."
A special from Glencoe Camp, dated Oc
tober 23. says:
"After the alleged victory Friday the
British imagined they were free from fur
ther molestation for some days, but they
soon found that the earlier reports of a
sweeping success were exaggerated. The
reported capture of all the Boer guns was
Incorrect. The burghers succeeded In re
moving some of them before the British
carried the hill, leaving only the riflemen
behind to cover their retreat.
"On Saturday news was received of Gen
eral Jouberfs main column threatening
Dundee. General Yule quickly recognized
the impossibility of defending noih Dun
dee and Glencoe against such superiority
of numbers, and sent word to Ladysmit'n
of his dangerous situation and ordered the
evacuation of Dundee, which commence!
with long range firing by the big guns at
daybreak Sunday. The Boers male ex
cellent practice and the shells from a
forty-pounder occupying the Impntl
Mountains dropped in and around tho
town. In the meanwhile the British had
reached Glencoe In safety. There orders
reached General Yule on Monday to fa I!
back on Lady smith. At the same time
he was informed that a large force was
waiting at Elands Laagte to assist his
retirement. Glencoe Camp was accord
ingly evacuated. The precarious position
of the British was not known to the
Boers."
A belated dispatch sent from Glencoe
camp on the night of the battle in that
vicinity admits that few Boer dead and
wounded were found on the field and at
tempts to explain this by saying:
"Throughout tho fighting the Boers. In
accordance with their custom, buried
their dead and carried off their wounded
Immediately after they fell, those left
representing only the casualties during
the last moments of the fighting. Even
their disabled cannon were removed.' al
though broken pieces of them 'could be

An official British account of the fight
at Reitfontein, given out at Cape Town,
says:
"Yesterday Sir George White, having
ascertained by previous reconnolssanco
that the Free State forces had moved
east from Besters -Station and were at
tempting to gain the road from Lady
smith to the north, moved out In the di
rection of inlands Laagte with the Fifth
Lancers, Nineteenth Hussars, Imperial
Light Horse, Natal Mounted Volunteers,
two field batteries, one mountain battery
and a brigade of infantry. The enemy
posted a battery two miles south of

fire at long range on the British advance
guard, consisting of the Nineteenth Hus

and it is assumed they were mounted infantry."
In the course of a reply relative to the arrangements made for the care of
the wounded; Mr. Windham said there wore ample storks of medicines, etc.. with
all the British forces, but possibly, if they were forced to care for many Boers,
the British resourros would be strained, and the- Government was making pro
vision for this contingency. On October 23, he added, three Boer doctors, with as
sistants, arrived at Ladysmith. and the Boer wounded were placed in the Dutch
church in their charge. These doctors expressed gratitude and satisfaction at the
unexpected arrangements for the comfort ami welfare of the wounded.

MIDST OF ANARCHY
ComplaiQt Made of tt)e Methods
of the flmericao Military
Governors.
I HAVANA. Oct %.â The Tribune, edited by Senor Aleunan,' formerly
prominently identified with the Cuban revolutionary movement,' says to-day:
' "Cuba is now in the midst of anarchy, which is aided and abetted by the
I Government of that republic, whose President pretends, in the name of lib
erty, to spread the military supremacy of the United States all over the
â¢ world. This plan, proposed by the business men of America, is now being
carried out by Mr. McKinley.
"Cubans are not such fools as to believe that the reports sent to Washing
t' by the military Governors do not contain more than appears In the
American newspapers. The reports sent to Washington are craftily worded
They show how false and double-minded are the intervening authorities who
govern Cuba at the pleasure of military commanders. They have even in
formed Washington that our newly formed political parties are not worthy
of the name, and that the men who direct them have no prestige, but have
undertaken to form parties without programmes."

Senator Depew gave out the following
i statement regarding the action of Alfred
j Vanderbilt:
When Alfred Vanderbllt returned he decided,
| from brotherly affection and for family har
, mony, to take out of his own inheritance and
give to his brother Cornelius a sum sufficient
to, make the fortune of Cornelius the same as
that of his brother and sisters. This has
been accepted by Cornelius In the same spirit.
This action -was altogether voluntary, no
threats having been made. Of course' there
might have been a contest under the terms of
the will, but there never was a suggestion of
one. The whole thing was done in a most
beautiful, brotherly way.
The entire fortune is estimated to be
about $70,000.00n. When some surprise was
expressed at the smallness of the amount
Senator Depew said it was not strange
when it is remembered that Mr. Vander
bilt had been giving away perhaps half
of his income for the last twenty-five
years. The exact amount of the fortune
that is distributed will not be known un
til it is appraised by the State officials.
The inheritance tax will be very large
It is estimated by good authorities that
it will amount to at least $1,500 000

DISAPPEARANCE
OF A WITNESS
New Sensation in the
Wilcoxson Case.
Â»
W. H. TOWNSEND IS MISSING
COULD GIVE VEBY IMPORTANT
TESTIMONY.

Unknown to Any of the
Principals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 26.â Who is W. H.
Townsend of 118 Broadway, Oakland, and
where can he be found? This question
arose to-day in a side issue of the now
more or less famous Austin-Wilcoxson
case, and it is one which may have much
bearing on Miss Amanda Austin's claim
cf $150,000 against the estate of her de
ceased uncle. Fcr over two weeks the
battle has been fought in the courts, and
it was only to-day that the defense
opened its case. The effect of Miss Aus
tin's mass of testimony was to show that
twenty years ago her millionaire uncle, a
bachelor, sent for her to leave her home
at Carrollton, Mo., to care for him in his
old age, and that she performed this duty
with the utmost fidelity up to his.death, a
couple of years ago. The testimony â  es
tablished the fact that Wilcoxson had told
various persons that he had $150,000 locked
up in his office safe in Sacramento which
was intended for Amanda, and that there
was a letter with the money addressed to
her making known the gift to her. Be
fore he died Wilcoxson deeded over to
.sixteen nephews and other relatives some
jaKj.ouO, but he left Amanda out of the
transaction entirely and out of his will,
explaining to various persons, according
to their testimony, that the money in the
safe, amounting to $150,000 in bank notes,
was exclusively hers, but that it was not
to be delivered to her until his death.
After his death the safe was opened and
the money found, but it is claimed that
there was no letter with it. The executor,
George Wilcoxson, refused to recognize
Amanda Austin's claim, and as no writing
was produced to prove it the money way
turned back into the estate to be divided
among the sixteen heirs, of whom, owing
to her omission from the will, Amanda
was not one.
The attorneys for Amanda Austin to
day produced a letter signed by W. H.
Townsend of Oakland stating that once,
while in YVilcoxson's office in Sacramento,
he saw the money and the letter ad
dressed to Miss Austin. He remarked to
Wilcoxson that the little safe was a !
strange place in Which to keep money,
and Wilcoxson replied:
"I'es, that is so, and It shows what
what great confidence I have in George," |
meaning George Wilcoxson, the executor, j
â¢'for it represents a legacy to one who has I
spent the better part of her life in my |
service and that letter contains my last
instructions to her."
Townsend added that there were cir- \
cumstances which could be recalled to
bear out his story. Miss Austin's attor
neys wired Townsend to come up imme
diately, but received no reply. Again he
was requested, and under date of the 24th
lnet wired that he would leave that night
cr yesterday morning sure. But he did !
I not come, and so another message was i
', s=ent. This la6t telegram elicited this re- j
i Ply:
â¢'OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â Left last night on
! Oregon express. Have not seen him
since. MAUTALEN."
Who Mautalen is and what has become ;
i of the important witness are mysteries
in a case which has already developed
more than one sensational feature.
OAKLAND, Oct. 26.-W. H. Townsend
has been hunted for in Oakland for sev- '
eral days, but no one has been able to
flnd him. There are several telegrams
waiting for him. At the address given
851 Broadway, no one ever heard of him' '
It is a cigar store only and there are no j
facilities for lodgers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1899.
DR. CRANE ROASTS THE GOVERNOR IN
HIS REPORT ON ASYLUM CONDITIONS
Objects to "Pull" Methods and Explains by Saying
He Lost Respect for Gage When He Backed
Up the Candidacy of Burns.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 26.â Conflicting forces, i
â¢which promise to create a political |
storm, clashed at the last meeting \
of the trustees of the Agnews Asy- j
lum. Dr. J. C. Crane, the Gover- |
nor*s new appointee as medical super- j
Intendent, presented his first report. After
lambasting in general the management of
the institution under the previous admin
istration he referred to "pull" methods
which some Influence had attempted to
continue in vogue. When the doctor was
taken to task by some of the trustees for
his reflection on the political methods
which have marked the handling of asy
lum affairs and was asked whether or not
he was "standing in" with the power that
had given him the Job he struck out
straight from the shoulder, figuratively
speaking, and stated that while he was
a friend of the Governor and a Repub
lican he would not hesitate to say that he
did not approve of Gage's political meth
ods, more especially his efforts In behalf â 
of Dan Burns. There was no ambiguity
about the doctor's words and his nerve
In thus boldly expressing himself has
been the talk of the trustees ever since, j
Some of them are attempting to excuse
his assertions on the ground that he had
lost his temper during the opposition
shown to his report.
Dr. Crane has gone to his home at
Santa Ana since the outburst and has
not been called upon to make any ex
planations to the Governor. Following
are extracts from the report which start
ed the storm:
"At the risk of being misunderstood and
misinterpretation placed upon my words
I deem It my duty to very briefly call
your attention to a few of these objec
tionable features, some of which have al
ready been corrected and others will be
at the earliest possible moment. Through
out th^e entire institution I find ample evi
dence of there having existed laxity of
DIFFICULTY IN
SECURING ARMOR
Work on Warships Is
Delayed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â The Navy De
partment has made public the report of
Rear Admiral Charles O'Neil, chief of
j ordnance. Admiral O'Neil goes at some
I length into the history of the present
difficulty in obtaining- armor suitable for
the new battleships and cruisers. Cun
| press last year limited the price cf armor
to $400 per ton. At this price no accept
able bids were received, but proposals
wt-re recently invited for armor for the
I three new battleships of the Maine class.
| the four harbor defense monitors of the
j Arkansas class and the three battleships
; and three armored cruisers. The total
; amount of armor necessary for the seven
i vessels authorized by act of Congress, ap
proved May 4, 189S, waÂ« 24,000 tons. Only
one firm put in a bid, and that at $450 per
> ton. It was ascertained on inquiry that
, these bidders had no manufacturing plant
: whatever, and the bid was not considered.
â¢ The difficulty in quality and price of
! armor arose in the desire of the depnrt
-1 ment to secure plates of what is gener
j ally known as the Knipp process, which
! is deemed much more satisfactory than
I the face-hardened armor heretofore in
use on American warships. The con
tractors claimed that it was impossible
to supply this armor for $400 per ton. and
the department, in order to avoid a delay
Jn the completion of certain vessels al
i ready contracted for, was obliged to con
tract in August and September of this
! year for a comparatively small â  amount
I of armor, aggregating 226S tons for the
vessels of the Maine class and for the
four harbor defense monitors.
There remain still to be contracted for
j 21.45S tons for the other vessels. In order
! not to delay the completion of the vessels
of the Maine class beyond contract date.
Admiral O'Neil says that it will be neces
sary to make contracts for the remaining
armor by January, 1900. He deplores the
suggestion that the ordinary face
hardened armor should be used in the new
vessels, and urges that the matter tnould
1 be laid before Congress as soon as it as-
Eembles, and that it be urgently requested
ito make such provisions in the early
| days of the session by joint resolution or
I otherwise as will enable the Navy De
partment to make contracts not Inter
â than January, 1900, for the best quality
'of armor that can be obtained. The same
â  should also be done, he says, for the tix
armored vessels authorized by the act of
March 3, 1899.
The Question of a Government armor
factory, he says, should have no bearing
uj.un the supply of armor for the Maine,
Ohio and Missouri, as it would be im
practicable, to obtain armor from such a
source In time to complete these vessels.
He says in conclusion that is it quite evi
dent that tho building of armored ships
of war must be soon discontinued by this
I Government unless the Vexed question of
I the supply and cost of armor can be ais
i posed of.
Admiral O'Neil notes that a new typo of
gun has been completed for the navy this
year and will be ready to test soon. It is
a fourteen-pound three-inch rapid-fire
I rifle intended as a part of the armament
!of the new "destroyers," and probably
will form an important part of thÂ©
secondary battery of future battleships
and large cruisers. It is a particularly
powerful pun of its size, and is calculated
I to have a penetrating power of over an
inch and a half of Harveyized steel at
3000 yards.
Complete batteries, main and secondary,
| together with ammunition and ordnance
| outfits have been already sh.pped to
i Hongkong for the former Spanish vesmrts
Isla de. Luzon, Isla de Cuba and Don Juan
do Austria. There is an Interesting
paragraph devoted to automatic ana
machine guns. A new type, fully auto
j matic, three-pounder gun, has been tried
I with promising results. It has a possible
I fire of seventy shots per minute, com
pared with forty shots per minute for the
H-nii-automatic guns of the same type.
Mention Ib made in tho report of the
joint small arms board of the army, navy
and marine corps, which considered the
adoption of a uniform caliber rifle for (he
three branches of the service. Admiral
O'Neil says that while there Is no fault
to be found with their decision to adopt
the army caliber (.30) together with tho
Canular cartridge of the navy, owing to
the time that would be consumed in the
experiments with tho new cartridge, his
bureau has decided to adopt the army rifle
outright in the purchase of tho additional
guns now needed. The report says the
new smokeless powder now in Ã¼bÂ« in the
navy is equal to the smokeless powder
now In use by any other country. The
estimates for the ensuing year are $6 -
503,124.
Rancher Badly Burned.
PETAI-UMA. Oct. 26.â C. C. Boysen, a
well-known rancher, was badly burned at
his home near this city this morning.
Boysen was aroused by the frantic cries
of his children and hurried to their room.
He found the bed and bedclothes ablaze
and the room filled with smoke. After
a hard battle Boysen succeeded in ex
tinguishing the flames, but not until he
had boen terribly burned about the head
and face.
discipline and good government which
cannot but be prejudicial to Its best and
highest Interests and that of the poor un
fortunates confine*! within its walls.
"Perhaps In no one direction has it been
so apparent as In the seemingly total ab
sence of mutual confidence and under
standirig between the executive head of
the institution and the assistant physi
cian, steward and the heads of other de
partments. The authority and counsel of
these latter officials seem to have been
quite generally Ignored, so that necessary
and clearly Indicated orders and instruc
tions have often failed to be issued, lest
they be countermanded at executive head
quarters. This lack of confidence and mu
tual concession and recognition could re
sult but in one way, namely, a breaking
down of all nice discipline and order and
a general discrediting of ail who could in
any manner be held responsible for such
a condition of things. This resulting con
dition has worked a great injury to some
good men and women who ought not to
have suffered on account of the loose rein
held over the institution. A few objection
able and inefficient employes seem to
have been retained in position by means
of what in common parlance has been
termed a 'pull,' the chief occupation of at
least one or two of them being that of
persistent 'soldiering.'
'There has also come to my notice the
somewhat loose and promiscuous distribu
tion of keys to the female wards, it even
being creditably established that one male
attendant has had one in his possession for
some time past. Viewed in the light of re
cent events, this latter fact cannot but be
a source of great distrust and anxiety,
and one that never should have been per
mitted to exist.
"Attendants and employes have from
time to time' been permitted unrebuked
to remain out late at night, returning in
some instances near the morning hours ut
terly unfit to discharge the duties of their
positions. They have also been allowed, to
a very great degree, the privileges of the
administration building, tho free use of
the telephone and constant access to the
superintendent's and assistant physician's
offices, all of which has caused much con
fusion and greatly disturbed the work of
those in and out of the wardÃ. But for the
WILL LOBBY ON
NATIONAL ISSUE
Temperance Union Ap
points a Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 2S.â Unless
something unforeseen should prevent it,
the next national convention of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
Will he held in Washington, D. C. A sen-
timent practically unanimous in favor of
thut city exists in the executive commit
tee of the National Union, to which body
the convention delegated the duty of iix-
Ing a place and time for the convention
of 1900. A mooting of the executive com
mittee waii held to-day, at which the
committee gave expression, to its prefer
ence for Washington.
The matter linally rests, however, with
the president, Mrs. L. M. N. Stevens, and
the other general officers. This was done
because there are certain arrangements
regarding entertainment to be made be
fore the mutter is settled.
The executive committee transacted
probably more important business at its
meeting to-day than it has at any pre
vious meeting here. It was decided
among other tnings to maintain an active
lobby at Washington this winter in order
to prevent the seating, if possible, of Con
fressm&n Brigham I<\ Roberts of Utah.
Irs. F. D. Kills of New Jersey is the
regular lobbyist at the national capital.
The matter will be placed in her charge,
the general officers of the National Union
assisting in every way and furnishing
powder, so to speak, for her guns. It was
also decided that a number of prominent
W. C. T. U. leaders fihould assemble at
"Washington during the session of Con
gress to aid Mrs. Ellis In her work.
The matter of the extension of the or
ganization and its anti-liquor work In
Cuba, Porto Rico and â¢ Hawaii was
brought up by President Stevens. It was
decided that steps should be immediately
taken by the general officers to effect an
organization in Cuba, Porto Rico and
Hawaii. No mention was made of the
Philippines.
SENATOR MASON MAY
RESIGN HIS SEAT
Then May Seek Re-election to Test
Public Sentiment Concerning
Expansion.
CHICAGO, Oct. 26.â William E. Mason
will resign his seat in the United States
Senate If the declarations of the Repub
lican national convention next year on
the question of the disposition of the
Philippines be of such tenor as to make
him feel he Is not in harmony with the
Republicans. Then he will be a candidate
before the Illinois Legislature for election
to succeed himself. By this method he
will test the sentiment of the people of
the State toward his views on national ex
pansion. He has at present no idea he
would be re-elected under such circum
stances.
For some time rumors have been cur
rent that Senator Mason contemplated re
signing from the Senate because of dif
ference between views held by him and
the views of the Republican party as rep
resented by President McKlnley with re
spect to the Philippines. The Senator was
asked to-day what truth there might be
in the rumors, and he replied:
"It Is true I have thought of resigning
and I am considering the matter, l have

Irving and Terry Arrive.
NEW YORK, Oct. 26.â Among the pas
sengers who arrived to-day on board the
fact there were many faithful and trust
worthy employes, who carefully and
thoroughly attended to their duties and
remained at their posts, confusion and
ultimate chaos must have reigned every
where. I am pleased to state to your
honorable board that already there has
been a marked change for the better in
all departments and everywhere, and
from ail I find a hearty willingness to as

Greeninger and O. A. Hale, but they re
fused to father the "pull" paragraph,
claiming that it was a reflection upon
I them and Governor Gage. A heated dls
i cussion followed, which wound up by the
usual rule being abandoned and" Dr.
Crane's report being received "all by Its

â¢ voting against making it any part of the

Mr. Hale was not exactly clear on the

I a Republican. The medico replied that ne

' Mr. Hale was suspicious and inquired if
! his Republicanism was tinged with silver

serted that he was a gold standard man
from the ground up.
"Then why In the name of common

Governor? In what respect does your poli

"I am a Republican and Governor Gage

NAVAL EXPERIMENTS
WITH MARCONI'S SYSTEM
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â Naval officers are looking forward with inter
est to the coming experiments the department is to make with the
Marconi system of wireless telegraphy. Arrangements have been made
between representatives of the Bureau of Equipment, of which Admiral
Bradford is the head, and Mr. Marconi, by which the department will
bear the expenses to which the inventor may be put in conducting the experi
ments. They are to be under the direction of a board of officers, of which Lieu
tenant Commander Newton and Lieutenants Hill and Bliss, all electrical ex
perts, are members. The cruiser New York and the battleship Massachusetts
are to be used for the experiments, the Navesink light station, on the New Jer
sey Highlands, being utilized as the shore station to which the messages will
be transmitted from the ships at sea. The first trip of the vessels to sea prob
ably will be made on Saturday as the apparatus necessary- for conducting the ex
periments will be made in all kinds of weather, at variable distances and while
the sea Is calm as well as rough, the purpose being to give the system a
thorough trial.
The offices of the department made a study of the experiments with the
wireless telegraphy during the yacht races, but as yet have made no official
report on the subject.
STEAMER ZURICH
HAS FOUNDERED
Entire Crew Believed to
Be Lost.
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 26.â Information has
reached here that the British steamer
ZurJoii, which sailed from Kovda October
12 for this port, foundered during a hurri
cane on October 21 at the Viglen Islands,
oft the west coast of Norway. It is added
that the captain was saved but it is
feared the crew has been lost.
The Zurich was of 1307 tons gross. She
was built in 1883 and was owned by Tur
ner, Brightman & Co. of London.
CHRISTIANA, Oct. 26.â Details of the
foundering of the Zurich have reached
here. It appears that when her fate was
evident the crew constructed two rafts.
The captain, three engineers, the second
mate and four negroes, with two dogs,
went with the first, and the mate, boat
swain, stoker, one white seaman and five
blacks with the second. Neither raft was
supplied with food or water and both were
buffeted by the waves for four days, the
crews starving.
The first raft was picked up near the
Bigton Islands on October 24, with only
the captain alive. The second raft wa3
washed ashore the following day, bearing
no trace of humanity except the corpse
of a negro.
ISTHMIAN CANAL
COMMISSION AT WORK
Will Probably Be Able to Present Its
Report in Time for Congress to
Act at the Next Session.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â The several
committees of the Isthmian Canal Com
slon are working daily at their rooms in
the Corcoran building:. All the members
of the commission which went to Paris
to Investigate the records and surveys
of the French Panama Company have re
turned to the city except General Ernst.
The advance survey parties sent to the
Isthmus are at work with the exception
of the party which is to examine the
routes below Panama, and it will be
dispatched shortly. The commission it
self will not leave the United States until
December. The members will make a
personal inspection of all the suggested
routes, those not heretofore completely
surveyed as well as the Nicaragua and
Panama routes. It is believed that this
examination will consume at least three
months, so that the commission will not
return to the United States until March.
But Inasmuch as all the preliminary work
in connection with the treaties, contracts,
examination of official surveys, etc., Is
being done in advance, the commission,
upon its return, can begin the preparation
of its report immediately
"I think we will be able to submit a
report," said Senator Pasco to-day, "In
time for Congress to act at the approach

SOCIALIST
PROVES TO
BE A CLAM
Beaten by Snips, a Rank Out-
sider â Favorites Out of
Luck at Oakland.
Of the several upsets at Oakland yester
day none occasioned more surprise than
the overthrow of Socialist, 2. t0 5 favorite
for the third event,, a seven furlong run,
by Snips. Twelve to one was laid against
the outsider, and* after Mounce, who rode
the mare, had trailed Lost Girl and So
cialist into the stretch, he made a well
timed move, beating the first choice a
length. Had Songer, on the favorite,
shaken off Lost Girl earlier In the game
It is just probable he would have scored.
Petal nosed Lost Girl out for show hon
ors.
It was somewhat of a tempestuous af
ternoon all around for favorites, Ollnthus
and Alicia being the only ones to earn
brackets. Don â¢ Luis, almost neglected,
captured the last event at odds of 10 to 1.
For the first number, a five furlong
scramble, Songer, astride the 7 to 10 fa
! vorite, Olinthus, took a dying chance in
I the stretch, and, getting through next the
' rail, downed the 60 to 1 shot, Monda; half
a length. The Offering ran third.
TVhaleback, 6 to 5 favorite for the seven
furlong run following, had his colors low
ered by O'Connor, the â second choice,'
piloted by Ward. Thorpe, on the first
choice, waited on O'Connor until a fur
long from home, when he put in his bid.
In a long, hard drive Caesar Young's
gelding stalled off the challenge, getting
the verdict by a head. Meadow Lark,
under hard urging, finished third.
The giant Silver Bullion once more suf
fered defeat in the six furlong spin for
two-year-olds. He was heavily backed to
beat Essence, but the Burns & Water
house youngster made all the running,
winning with a wet sail. Bullion was
kept busy the last hundred yards beating
out Expedient for the place.
Form Moore's useful mare, Alicia, fa
vorite in the ring at odds of 8 to 5, took
the mile and a sixteenth free handicap
after a hard drive from Ringmaster. Rio
Chlco led until nearing the paddock, when
the two horses mentioned passed him and
he landed in the show.
Uncertain Horton had first call in the
betting on the concluding six furlong sell
ing affair, but seems to be of little ac
count, never being a contender. Don Luis,
a vastly improved horse, overtook Tib
uron in the run to the wire, winning out
by a length. Old Libertine ran a close
third. â

FOOTBALL
PLAYED BY
FRESHMEN
Young Representatives of the
Two Big Universities Meet
Here To- Morrow.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 26.-
Football interest is centered in the annual
intercollegiate game to be played with
the Berkeley freshmen in San Francisco
Saturday.
The coaches are doing all in their power
j to bring home a victory to Stanford, while
! the players are eager for the fray. The
I cardinal's prospects were never better.
! If the men play up to the standard they
'â â  have attained In their preliminary matches
I victory should be within their reach. The j
I men who will compose Stanford's baby
! team this year are aggressive r-nd will- 1
1 ing workers, but lack the average
preparatory experience of former fresh
men teams. Not more than half of them
knew anything of the game before they
entered college. This may account for
the admirable spirit which they have
shown throughout the season, and may
! prove advantageous rather than other
-1 wise.
Raitt, the gritty little quarterback and
captain, is one of the few veterans of the
team, having learned the game while
Â§ laying with his High School team in
an Bernardino. Roberts and Crowell,
I respectively fullback and tackle, are both
â  from Belmont, where they gained a
j knowledge of the rudiments of the game.
Of the center trio Lee is the only man of
experience, having played several years
on an academy team in the East. Mc-
Fadden, at tackle, is new to the game,
but partially makes up for his lack of
knowledge by hie fierceness and strength.
Davis and Geer, at the ends, are both
new to their positions, leaving these
places probably the weakest points on
the team.
The backs have been weakened by the
injury of Roberts, fullback, and Sm;tn,
halfback. The former is suffering from
an injured shoulder, while the latter haa
an equally bad knee. If these iwo men
are not ablo to play in to-morrow's game
it will reduce Stanford's chances of a
victory. Among the substitutes are
Johns, center; Campbell full; P. Parker,
and Willot, halfs, and Luck, end. Tne
following are tne men as they will,prob
ably line up and the weight of each:
Lee, center, 185 pounds; Barnhlsel,
right guard, 180; Traeger, left guard, 193;
McFadden, left tackle, ISS; Crowell, right
tackle, 165; Davis, left end, 150; Geer and
Luck, right ends, 165 and 155; Smith, left
half, 156; Narramore, right half, 165;
Roberts, fullback, 163, and Raitt (captain)
150.
BERKELEY, Oct. 26.â The freshman
football Equad at Berkeley from which
Saturday's team will be chosen, is made
up as follows: Dibblee and Hudson, ends;
Robertson, Saeltzer, Gammon and Mlnni,
backs; Valentine and Jones, fullbacks;
Sabichl and Edwards, centers; Holley
and Cook, guards; Fox, Smith and Bund
schu. tackles, and McLain (captain),
quarterback.
The men have lined up against the big
eleven every day this week and are show-
Ing good form. Cochran and Kelley have
been putting on the finishing touches for
the last two or three days.

A special meeting of the Ingleslde

It was determined to abandon the cus
tomary meeting on the plains of Merced.
To replace this a special stake for large
prizes will be run at InKleside next
month. It is expected to attract the best
of the dogs in training. Preliminary steps
were taken In preparation for the annual
banquet, which has always been one of
the most noted gatherings of coursing
men each year.

half a length from Rey del San Juan, who
beat Alaria by a clean length.

FETV stories of crime at sea equal
In sheer fiendishness that brought
to this port yesterday by the cap
tain and crew of the ship Oeorge
H. Stetson of Bath, Me., destroyed by
fire in the China Sea in September
last. Most of them are morally cer
tain, although lacking legal proof,
that a member of the ship's company
âa moral degenerateâ applied the torch
that set the vessel ablaze and drovo
them to the boats, In which they
rowed for two days, after -witnessing
the destruction of their ship, before
they made land.
The George H. Stetson, 1700 tons,
Captain P. W. Patton, was built
eighteen years ago at Bath and was
owned by the Bewails. She was bound
from Portland to Taku, China, with
a cargo of lumber when destroyed.
She- was in latitude 24 degrees 3S min
utes north, longitude 125 degrees 49
minutes east, twenty-five miles to the
eastward of the island of Tat-pin-san,
on the evening of September 25,
when flames wore discovered pouring
from the fore hatch. The alarm was
quickly given and all hands were soon
â¢t work attempting to subdue the
flames, there being no reason to sus
pect at that time that' the fire could
not easily be extinguished. It gained
so rapidly, however, that fifteen min
utes after the flames had been dis
covered the ship was ablaze from the
mainmast forward. High up In the
rigging the tongues of fire leaped
ing rapidly. All around was a
shower of sparks, falling to set ablaze
the ai"; or part of the vessel.
Through all the danger in the
flames and sparks the plucky wife of
Captain Patton, who has been at sea
WILL WORK TO
FREE CHURCHES
FROM TAXATION
The Congregational
ists Take Action.
The California State Association of Con
gregational Churches yesterday morning
appointed a committee, consisting of Rev.
J. K. McLean. Rev. Dr. G. C. Adams and
Thomas Addlson, to take charge of the
work for the abolition of church taxa
tion In California. The subject was
broached at the morning session by Dr.
Adams, who declared that California was
the- only State in the United States where
churches were taxed, and he cited the
amounts paid yearly by a number of
churches to show the extent of the bur
den California Christians are compelled
to bear. The appointment of the commlt-
U-e was accompanied by an expressed de
termination to inaugurate an aggressive
campaign.
The report of the committee on temper
ance, which has been made a special or
der for & o'clock, was adopted after being
slightly amended by striking out the rec<
emmendation that anti-saloon leagues be
organized within the churches. At the
time the work of the Anti-saloon
.â  was heartily indorsed. Some dls
cusfcion arose over an attempt to secure
an indorsement by the association of pro
htbition. Tlie delegates refused to formu
late an official expression on the subject
ami tho attempt failed.
There was also rjulte a long discussion
over the personnel of the executive com
mittee of the Home Mission Society. Dr.
Adams. I>r. Brown of Oakland. Dr. Rader
and Dr. Moore were elected, but the last
three, desiring that representation be
given to the members from outside dia
trlcts and lay members, tendered their
resignations. Dr. A'lams declared that It
There are many good reasons why these physi-
cians have attained their present high standing.

with him for five years, stood bravely
by with her little two-year-old daugh
ter, unafraid and equal to any for
tune. The little girl, instead of show-
Ing signs of fear as might be ex
pected under such circumstances,
viewed the whole fiery 'spectacle as
something to be pleased at, and all
through the shouts and the din of
excitement she voiced her enjoyment
of the fire.
Less than half an hour after the
fire was discovered, the ship having
been previously headed landward. It
me plain that it would be neces
sary to take to the boats. The ship
and cargo were 'loomed and It took
only the loud explosion denoting the
blowing out of the cabin skylight to
warn captain and crew that it was
time to take to the open sea. There
was neither time nor inclination to
save anything and the entire ship's
company was soon in the three boats,
headed for the Island of Tal-pin-san.
The current was against the boats
and all that night they made little
headway, being In plain sight of the

Rev. Dr. C. R. Brown was Hooted
preaoher of the association for the session
of 1901.
Aside from the business the feature of
the morning session was a statistical pa
per by R''V. 11. ]Z. Jewett, covering fifty
years of Congregationalism In California.
In the afternoon Mrs. C. B. Bradley
read a papor on "Why Should Missionary
Societies Enoouragfl the Education of
Women In Non-Christian Lands." Rev.
Dr. C. R. Brown read a paper, on "The
Distinctive Characteristics of Christian
ity," and a number of members made
verbal reports from the International
council.
At the evening session Rev. J. A. Mil
liken of Porterville explained that t h<>
published reports of his address delivered
Wednesday night did him an Injustice.
He Intended no reflection on the pioneers
when he said that he took courage for
thf future of California from the fact
that he had burled many pioneers. What
he meant was that the old pioneers are
passing away and with them was passing
the condition of things that prevailed in
the early days, that made the reform
work and religious work of the higher
type so difficult. "I referred to 'things,'
not 'men.' " said Mr. Milllken.
The work of the Sunday-School and
Publishing Society was reviewed at the
evening session and a number of r.ports
of the meeting of the American Board at
Providence, R. 1., were heard.
The final session of the association will
be held this lon-noon, it having been
decided to adjourn -at noon to-day Instead

Illumination with its rosiny cargo.
All the next day they could see the
smoke. It took them two days, dur
ing which they ran out of water, to
reach Tal-pin-san, where they found
awaiting them the small steamer that
makes monthly trips between' the
Island and the mainland. Its officers
had seen the Illumination of the burn

of its officers and crew. It took them
to Nagasaki, where they took pas

son made up the passenger list of the
ITnlteil States army transport City of
Sydney, which arrived In port yester
day afternoon, docking immediately
after a quick passage of twenty-nine
days from Manila, touching at Naga
saki and Kobe en route. Fine weather
was experienced all the way across,
except on October 15, when the trans
port got Into the track of a typhoon,
which, tumbled things about. One of
the cabin passengers. Lieutenant

who has been â In the Philippines,
was knocked off his feet by the force
of the hurricane and hurled from Btar

suspect him? I guess not. If they
did he wouldn't be on board this boat
now to tell about It. The captain
knows it, but is keeping mum about
it. I know he reported his suspicions
to the Sydney's officers and they have
had the man under surveillance all
the way up."
Captain Patton refused to say any
thing concerning the report, more
than that thoro was something en
tirely peculiar about the fire.
"What is the name of the man you
suspect?"
"I cannot say anything about that
now." ho replied.
After the captain got ashore he
hurried to a telegraph office and It
was said later that he had tele
graphed to Bath asking authority to
incur the necessary expense to prose

Individual, whoever be is, was not
detained on the transport.

On board the transport are the
bodies of Private Peor of the Ninth In

and Private Jeremiah Qulnlan, Ninth
Cavalry, who died October 14. Private
Kellerman of the Fourth Cavalry,
while Insane from disease, Jumped
through a porthole and into the China
Sea. A boat was lowered and got very
close to the soldier, who was swim

hands and disappeared. The body was
not recovered.

of the officers and crew of the United

NARROW ESCAPE
OF THE FRENCH
BARK BOURBAKI
Caught Fire at the
Seawall Yesterday.
For a short time yesterday the French
bark Bourbaki was in imminent danger
of being destroyed by fire. She was
alongside the seawall taking in "stiffen
ing" preparatory to going to Port Costa
to load wheat for Europe. About 2500
sacks of grain had been put aboard and
the ship was to be ready to move up
stream to-morrow morning. The long
shoremen had laid off for the noon hour
and the crew had finished their midday
meal and retired to the forecastle, when
the fire was discovered. There was con
siderable turpentine and paint oil in the
carpenter shop, and some one going in
there dropped a lighted match. The place
was soon in a blaze and the Fire Depart
ment was summoned. The Spreckels
Towboat Company was also notiried and
in a very short space of time the Relief
was alongside ana had four streams or
water playing on the blazev
In the meantime, however, the vessel a
side had got no hot that the paint was
peeling oft In great flakes and the smoke
was pouring out of the ventilators and
chocks. L.uckily the vessel had an iron
deck, so none of the water that was
poured into the forecastle got into the
lower hold, so the cargo is uninjured. It
will not take long to get the Bourbaki
ready for sea again, and she will prob
ably sail next week.
French ships are going to play a very
important part in the commerce of San
Francisco next year. So many of them
will be here bidding for the wneat trade
that the British are liable to have to take
second place, l^ast year but ten ships
flying the French Hag came to San Fran
cisco. This year over twenty have ar
rived and "several more are on the way.
Next year at least fifty French ships
built of steel and with all the latest im
provements will visit this coast.
This wonderful Increase in the French
merchant marine is due to the subsidy
given by the French Government. Every
palling vessel built in France of French
material between now and 1902 gets for
ten years a subsidy of 35 cents per gross
ton for each thousand miles covered.
Every year there Is a reduction of about
IVi cents, so that the last year of the ten
the vessel's subsidy would only be about
23 cents a ton. For instance, a French
vessel of 2000 tons gross burden coming
from Europe to San Francisco gets a
subsidy of $14,000 for the voyage here and
a similar sum for the voyage home. For
this encouragement all the French Gov
ernment asks is that the vessels be built
in France of French material and enter
at a French port at least once in two
years. Over and above this the builder
of the ship gets a bonus of $13 a gross ton
for his share of the work. It is, there
fore, no wonder that the French
shipyards are working night and day and
that a fleet of at least fifty French ships
is expected here in 1900.

SNEAK TACTICS OF THE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC.
ON Sunday, October 15. The Call announced
that the Southern Pacific Company, was en
gaged in a plot to have General N. P. Chip
man, one of its well-known supporters, appointed to
the vacancy on the Inter>tate Commerce Commis
sion. The scheme was cunningly laid, because the
merchants and manufacturers of the entire coast
were actively at work to procure the selection of a
representative of the coast for the office, and the
railroad manager? saw an opportunity to use the
efforts of these men to further the ends of the rail
road itself.
The Call has proof that the petition requesting the
intment ot Chipman was drawn up in the office
of the Southern Pacific Company and was circulated
by Judge Carpenter. When The Call exposed the
scheme the attempt to obtain additional support for
man was dropped, and the petition forwarded to
Washington.
It behooves the merchants of Seattle, Tacoma,
Portland, Los Angeles, San Diego, as well as San
Francisco and all other cities of the Pacific Coast, to
send at once an energetic protest to Washington
against the appointment of Chipman.
It is not a pleasant task to oppose the aspirations
of any Californian for the ofiice, but in this case the
danger to the interests of the public is so great that
the opposition must be made at once and energeti
cally. It will go hard with the interests of this coast
if the Southern Pacific manages to get one of its

THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
AT the last session of the Pennsylvania Legis
lature a committee composed of two Senators |
and three Representatives was appointed to
confer with the Legislatures of other States with a
view to bringinp about an amendment to the consti
tution of the United States providing tor the election
of United States Senators by direct vote of the peo- j
pie. The committee has just held at Philadelphia a'
meeting at which it was announced that communica
tions have been received from the Secretary of State j
of every State in the Union with the exception of
Arkansas, and that there is a strong sentiment, par- j
ticularly in the Western States, in favor of the amend- j
ment.
Upon the showing made the committee felt so
much encouraged it decided to request all the States
to send delegates to a general conference to be held
in Philadelphia next spring to devise ways and
means for bringing the issue to a conclusion. It is
expected the conference will decide upon a plan of j
action which will coflimend itscli to the people as a !
whole, and that as a result there will be immediate'!
action thereafter in the direction of the desired I
amendment.
Just why there should be a conference on the sub- I
ject is not clear. All the States have Representa
tives in Congress, and these are just as well fitted to
discuss and determine a plan cf action as any other
delegates could be. In the end the matter will have i
to be submitted to Congress, and it would be just
as well to urge action upon that body tin's winter as
to wait for the conference next spring.
The whole question has been thoroughly discussed
throughout the*country and the people are familiar
with the causes which render the change necessary
fer the national welfare. There have been deadlocks
â¢r worse in Senatorial elections in Legislatures in
every portion of the Union from Delaware to Cali
fornia. It is time to put an end to them and to re
move from the State Legislatures these fruitful
sources of corruption and disturbance. It not in
frequently happens that business of great impo^ance
to a State is set aside because of the struggles over j
a Senatorial election. Under such circumstances a !
conference on the subject is hardly neressary. It will
of course do no harm, but it is sate to say that the
Senator or Representative who will not vote for sub
mitting the amendment to the States at once will
hardly be persuaded to do so by anything a con
ference can say or do-.
PUBLIC SENTIMENT.
WHEN one meets with politicians, as the Presi
dent does on his tours over the country, noth
ing is easier than to provoke, or induce, what
seems to be a unanimous and enthusiastic indorse
ment of imperialism.
When the President made his Pittsburg speech to
the returned volunteers of the Tenth Pennsylvania the
report of the occasion entirely warranted the conclu
sion that the soldiers and the people were as one in
favor of forcible annexation of the Filipinos. Now
comes the Pittsburg Post with a large number of
signed and authentic interviews with the officers and
members of the regiment in which opinions in direct
antagonism to the President's speech are freely stated.
The whole is summed up by one of the staff officers,
who says: "The regiment sympathized with the na
tives a? righting for a liberty as dear to them as is the
American's to him. The Tenth boys look upon for
cible annexation of the islands as foreign to the ideals
of the American constitution, and from a mere mone
tary point of view as promising only aggrandizement
to a few rich syndicates and heavier taxes to the la
borer because of the huge military force necessary to
hold them." Among the interviews is a letter writ
ten by the gallant Colonel Hawkins, who lost his
life in the poison climate of the islands, in which he
says that "any attempt to hold the islands as colo
nies is a menace to American institutions, and they
are not worth the cost of conquest." Then follow in
terviews with the majors, quartermaster, adjutant, six
captains, five lieutenants and several hundred pri
vates, all of whom express the same opinion. Many
of the privates say: "Of course we obeyed orders
and fought, but what for? Those natives have as
much right to liberty as we have."
We have not the space to copy all of these very in
teresting and significant interviews. When it is re
membered that they are from a majority of the staff
and line of a regiment which the President made a
long journey to welcome, and which he flattered by
the most heroic ascriptions, the politicians may be
led to revise their frequent statement that the coun
try is unanimously imperialist. An American can
hardly imagine a more serious situation for a brave
and obedient soldier than the exposure of his own
life to kill others whom he regards as right and
patriotic in fighting for their liberty to govern them
selves and the freedom of the soil on which they were
born.
Another recent expression that may interest the
imperialist politicians of both parties is the passage
of a resolution in the national session of the
\Y. C. T. U. denouncing the war on the Filipinos.
The wives and mothers and women composing the
W. C. T. U. are of the thoughtful class of society.
They are women who would encourage war in a
cause which they believed to be righteous, and when
they denounce this a? unrighteous it means some
thing. We think that the people everywhere should
know the facts about these expressions of opinion.
With a large percentage of returned volunteers and
the largest women's organization in the Union giving
free expression to such views there must soon be an
abatement in what has seemed to many as a mad
rush into imperialism and all the cost and entangle
ments which it implies. As the necessity of defend
ing England in a like.policy has already appeared,
one may reasonably expect the Tenth Pennsylvania
and the W. C. T. U. will soon receive many recruits.
While the Britons and the Boers are fighting to
decide which shall own South Africa it may occur- to
the blacks to take a hand in the matter and resume
possession of the country themselves. In the South
African woodpile there is a negro of large propor
tions, and he is a fighter when he gets started.
BRITISH POWER ON TRIAL.
WHEN General Buller sent a dispatch to Sir
George Stewart White commanding that offi
cer to make no forward movement on the
Transvaal until Buller himself arrived with his army
curp? he probably did not foresee that the question of
advance or retreat was not to be left to the option of
General White. The Boers have settled the question
for him. Despite the defense made by the British
and the reverses suffered in the fighting of the first
two days, the Transvaal forces have continued to act
upon the aggressive, and it now looks as if White
will have a4l he can do to save his command from
virtual annihilation before the commander in chief
with the reinforcements reaches him.
In addition to the strain of the situation at the
front, the British public have -another cause of
anxiety in the reports that come of the sentiment of
the nations of Continental Europe regarding the war.
The hostility shown to the United States at the out
break of the war with Spain was slight in comparison
with what has been expressed toward the British,
and there have even beer, rumors that the powers
would demand of Great Britain a statement of her
intentions as to the whole African continent, thus in
cluding the Egyptian question with that of the Trans
vaal.
While it is not at all likely an alliance against
Great Britain can be formed so long as that power j
remains formidable, it is within the limits of proba
bility that a serious reverse in South Africa might
tempt the Russians and the Germans to be bolder in
their aggressions in China and the French more en
terprising in pushing their African territory toward
the Nile. Some fear of such a result seems to be felt
in Great Britain, and as a consequence they have
made preparations for war on a scale calculated to.
warn Europe as well as to crush the Boers.
The task they have before them is the greatest ths
British have had to enter upon since the Napoleonic
wars. Their statesmen and their military leaders
agree that it is desirable from every point of view to
force the fighting and put an end to the conflict as
speedily ns possible. No less than eighty steamships
of the first class have been drawn into the service of
the Government, and as soon as the war broke out
it was announced that arrangements had been made
to dispatch six troopships daily from Southampton
for South Africa. It was calculated ;it thnt time that
within a week after General P.uiler started to the
front there would be upward of 50,000 British soldiers
on the sea speeding after him as fast as ste;un can
carry them.
It is, however, a far cry from Southampton to the
field of action. It remains to be seen whether the
British forces now in South Africa can hold thÂ»-ir
own or even save themselves from a crushing defeat
before the reinforcements arrive. In the meantime, to
be prepared for the worst, the whole naval strength of
the empire is being made ready for any emergency
that may happen. Grent Britain is. in fact, making
a demonstration in force throughout the whole length
of her far-flung battle line from Gibraltar to China.
Her statesmen know that her foes are watching every
move, and that unless they end this war quickly they
may have more wars to wage before it ends.
One nf the notable features of the speeches made
by the President in his tour through the Mississippi
Valley was the emphasis which he placed upon the
financial question. "We are on the gold basis," he
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1899.
said, "and we are there to stay." Those time-serving
Republicans who have been opposed to definite action
on currency irsues at the coming session of Congress
have evidently had no influence with the administra
tion.
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S POLICY.
PRESIDENT WHEELER'S address on the
occasion of his installation as president of the
University of California was in the nature of a
declaration of the policy he would pursue in the ad
ministration of his office. It is a policy of progress,
improvement and expansion. The words in which it
was set forth are strong and forceful and will inspire
as well as gladden all who desire to see the univer
sity become one of the foremost seats of learning in
the United States.
The president began by directing attention to the
existing deficiencies and needs of the institution.
"As it were in a night," he said, "a college has
grown here into the dimensions of a university. A
torrent-influx of students has overwhelmed and
burst the barriers of organization, equipment, funds
and shelter. A mass of rapidly developing profes
sional schools, drawn beneath the name and aegis of
the university, have become attached to its organiza
tion by bonds of varying strength, but all ill-tested
and uncertainly set. The schools of the State have
been recently brought into a close connection with
the university, a connection which is still tentative,
but which looks toward a fine unity of action, toward
a common aim. To intensify the stress and confusion
these things have happened at a period when through
out the land the whole mechanism of university edu
cation is in process of readjustment and of adaptation
to larger work. Shifting, experiment and change are
on every hand; nowhere have settled forms been
reached."
As a result of this rapid growth the university has
outstripped its buildings and equipments. Among
the demands which the president notes as of greatest
urgency is an enlargement of the library. "In their
isolation from the Eastern storehouses of learning."
said he, "our scholars require and deserve more than
ordinary resources of this kind." As a further argu
ment and an inducement for the upbuilding of the
library he added: "We are tangent to the domain
of the farthest world-half, of which the Western
world knows yet but little, but of which it will be"
called upon in the coming centuries to know much.
Here on the borderland, as in Alexandria of old,
must be garnered the accumulated lore of the East
as well as the West."
Thus far the argument of the president had been
mainly for scholarship and might have been made by
a man who considers that to be the chief object of
university life, but from that point he passed rapidly
to a consideration of the things needed to make the
university a center of intellectual activity directed to
the advancement of California in all lines of progress.
The school- of commerce, the school of mining en
gineering and the school of agriculture all engage
the interest of the new president, and in no part of
his address was he more earnest or more hopeful than
in speaking of them and the work expected of them.
In a striking passage the speaker described the im
portance of the problem of forest preservation and
the maintenance of the water supply of the State, and
included that problem among those which the uni
versity will help the people to solve. "A school of
forestry," he said, "is an earnest and instant need
The waters that sent forth the Oregon deserve
school of naval engineering. The attention of the
National Government, which now has a Pacific as
well as an Atlantic to care for, should be directed
toward this need. But what it does can best be done
in co-operation with the university as an already es
tablished institution and through development and
differentiation of the existing courses."
It will be seen that President Wheeler proposes to
make the university a part of every movement in
the progress of the State from scholarship to money
making. The whole scope of our higher activities.
j material as well as intellectual, is included within the
â¢ domain of the field which the university is to culti
vate. Lord Bacon's saying. "All wisdom is my prov
ince," is to be fulfilled at Berkeley. The university
is to be a living thing., a vital part of the common
wealth, with sympathy for all the enterprises and
i hopes of its people. â¢
THE THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.
PROSPERITY is the theme of President Mc-
Kinley's proclamation fixing Thursday, No
vember 30, as the day for the annual thanks
giving of the people. It will also be the theme on
which most of the sermons oi the day will be
preached, for it is the dominant feature of our na
tional life.
The President has well said: "Seldom has this
nation had greater cause for profound thanksgiving.
No great pestilence has invaded our shores. Liberal
employment waits upon labor. Abundant crops have
rewarded the efforts of the husbandman. Increased
comforts have come to the home. The national
finances have been strengthened and public credit
has been sustained and made firmer. In all branches
of industry and trade there has been an unequalcd
degree of prosperity, while there has been a steady
gain in the mqraland educational growth of our na
tional character. Churches and schools have flour
ished. American patriotism has been exalted. Those
engaged in maintaining the honor of the flag with
such signal success have been in a large degree spared
from disaster and disease. An honorable peace has
been ratified with a foreign nation with which we were
at war, and we are now at friendly relations with
every power on earth."
All that is thus set forth in reference to the con
dition of our own country is true, and it is to be hoped
the President's further predictions of the speedy return
<.f healthy industrial conditions in Cuba, prosperity
in storm-stricken Porto Rico and peace in the Phil
ippines will be fulfilled. It is only in these islands
that any menace to our continued peace exists, and
none would exist there if the people .of the islands
were assured of the good purposes of the United
States. So long as the Filipinos have reason to dis
trust our promises, or the Cubans to fear the
forcible annexation of their country to the United
States, they will of course hesitate to join us in the
thanksgiving to which the President invites them.
Such vexatious problems as confront us, however,
are slight in comparison to the vast benefits we en
joy. No land on earth is so blessed as ours in all
that makes up the welfare of humanity. We are ad
vancing in all lines of endeavor and are at peace with
all the world save the inhabitants of a group of re
mrte islands who are too weak to threaten Us with
any danger. We are free from the burdens of mili
tary armaments that oppress the taxpayers of other
countries, and we have only to go in the path the
fathers of the republic marked out for us in order t.Â»
continue at peace. Every natural condition of the
year is advantageous to us and the prospects of the
future are bright. We have good reason to give
thanks this year, and it will be our own fault if we
do not have equally good in the year to come.
SWORD FOR ANOTHER HERO OF MANILA
\ Beautiful Tiffany Sword for Brigadier
General Funstonâ Gift of the People
of Kansas.
TIFFANT & CO. of New York have completed and shipped to the Topeka
Capital a beautiful presentation sword, the gift of the people of Kansas to
their idol and distinguished hero, Brigadier General Frederick Funston.
Through the Topeka Capital the people of Kansas contributed $1000 for this
purpose. The sword is an example of the highest quality of workmanship.
In this particular and in beauty of design General Funston will possess a sword
second to none that has been presented to American heroes.
The pommel is encircled by a wreath of oak leaves, and surmounted by an
American eagle in full relief. The grip is of sterling silver, chased to simulate
the scales' of the coat-of-mail of the Goddess Minerva. The guard is formed of
a female figure in full relief, bearing a wreath of laurel and a torch. On the
broad portion of thel guard, on the back, is the seal of the State of Kansas, and
on the front the monogram "F. P.," made of diamonds. The guard terminates
in a sunflower, the center of which is a carved topaz. The scabbard is of ster
ling silver, ornamented with three bands, to which are attached the belt trap
pings, which are chased by hand to represent the various fruits and plants of
the Philippines, Upon these bands al-so are Inscribed the names of the battlesâ
Caloocan, Polo, Marilao, Guiguinta, Malolos, Bagbag, Calumpit, Apalit, San
Tomas, San Fernandoâ and two miniature tropical scenes. On the upper band
of ornament, is the badge of the Eighth Army Corps on one side and the Roman
fasces on the opposite side. The lower band, forming the toe of the scabbard.
Is ornamented with a monogram of the letters, "t\ S."
The blade is of the finest steel, made in accordance with the United States
army regulations in every respect. On one side of it is etched and gilded
General Funston's now famous reply to General Mac Arthur's inquiry as to the
strength of his position on a certain occasion: "I can hold the position until my
regiment is mustered out." On the opposite Side of the blade is the presentation
inscription: "Presented to Brigadier General Frederick Funston by the people of
Kansas."
With the exception of the blade, every particle of metal in the sword is of
fine sterling silver, while all the ornaments on pommel, scabbard, guard and
belt mountings, etc., are heavily gold plated. The belt and sword knot are of
the finest material, and in strict accordance with army regulations. The mono
gram on the guard is of diamonds and the whole is executed in the highest
class of workmanship. A handsome case, lined with chamois and with silver
name plate, completes the very handsome testimonial to the distinguished Kan
sas soldier.â Baltimore American.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1899.
PRESIDENT IS
ASKED TO GIVE
CHIPMAN SEAT
Southern Pacific Now
Unmasked.
HERRINGS HANDIWORK SHOWN
Candidate of the Business Men of the
Pacific Coast for Interstate
Commissioner Opposed by
the Railroad.
The Southern Pacific Company is now
openly opposing the selection of the can
didate of the Pacific Coast .Jobbers' and
Manufacturers' Association for the posi
tion of Interstate Commerce Commission
erâW. R. Wheeler of this city. A peti
tion, drawn up bfr Judge R. B. Carpenter,
at the Instigation of W. F. Herrln,
chief of the law department of the
Southern Pacific Company, and taken
personally by him to prominent
citizens of San Francisco and Los
Angeles for signatures, asking for the
appointment of General Chipman from
President McKlnley, Is already In Wash
ington and in the President's hands. The
petition bears the names of several prom
inent citizens of California, among them
the names of Federal judges, a trustee
of the Mechanics' Institute, an officer of
i the Merchants' Association, also the name
| of a leading officer of the San Francisco
Board of Trade and others not known at
this writing.
The history of the matter Is this: Soon
j after the seafin the Interstate Commerce
I Commission became vacant representa
! tiveÃ of the Southern Pacific Company
called upon certain leading merchants 01'
this city and told them that they desired
that the appointment should be given to
i General Chipman. The m%rchantÂ«, know-
I ing that a man acquainted with business
i and traffic conditions was needed, refused
Ito elgn for Chipman. Judge Carpenter
i then personally called upon- certain per-
I sonal friends of Chipman and.also upon
others and secured their signatures by
; representations of various kfmls. The
! pttition was then placed in the hands of
I Senator Perkins and was forwarded by
| him to President McKlnley. Senator Per
! kins said yesterday that he had forward-
I ed the petition only just as he had pc-
I titions for several others who have also
: aspired to the position of commissioner.
The Southern Pacific Company acted
quicker than could the merchants, who
did not take any concerted action until
the present week, when the meeting of
the Pacific Coast Jobbers' - and Manu
facturers' Association was held in this
city. The merchants are doing all they
can to forward the candidacy of Mr.
â \Yhet-ler, who was the unanimous choice
i of the executive committee of the Pa
cific Coast Association, representing the
business of the coast from Puget Sound
to San Diego.
They will send a petition to President
McKinley In a few days and will try to
I enlist the support of all the Congressional
representatives of the Pacific Coast in the
interest of their choii-e- Mr. Wheeler.
This news will come as a surprise to near
ly all the mercantile community. It jus
tifies everything that was said by The
Call concerning the Southern Pacific Com
pany's attempt to seat Chipman.

They Bay They Were Turned Adrift
From the Omaha Exposition.
Regittients Arriving.
Fourteen belated Filipinos were sent out
to the Presidio yesterday to find quarters
in the casual camp until the Government
â¢can send them home on one of the trans
ports.
The Filipinos were membersof the troupe
of singers that was exhibited at the
Omaha Exposition. They say that their
contract was that they were to have all
their expenses paid, and some of them
were to receive $5 a month in addition.
They declare that they have received
nothing for two months, however, and that
they are In destitute circumstances. They
reached here last Monday, and since then
they have been living anywhere they
could. Some friends gave some of them
the use of two empty rooms, but they
could not be provided for all the time, so
GerTeral Shatter was appealed to. He
had them tent out to the camp, and there
they will stay until they can be taken
home. More of them will drift in from
Omaha in the next few days, for there
were forty in the troupe, and they have
been scattered all the way from Omaha
to this city. They have no friends and
cannot make any fight for the money they
say Is due them, so they were In danger
of becoming public charges when General
Shafter made them wards of the army.
A few of them have shown a desire to
remain in this country if they can find
Work, but It is not likely thÂ«y will be al
lowed to do 80. The understanding was
that when they had finished their exinbi
tion they should be returned to the
islands by the exposition people; other
wise it is doubtful If they yrould have
been allowed admission.
The Tw.>nty-eighth Regiment is short at
leaÃt one man. He showed up at the
general hospital yesterday much the
worse for wear, and explained that he
had missed the transport. He said too. in
justification, that he had broken his leg
and had been otherwise injured, the
presumption being that he had received
the injuries in a mad rush to catch the
vessel. He had no bones broken, how
ever, and he was turned over to the guard
* NEW ADVERT T SEMENTS.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26, 1899.
Editor of The Call: A vote for Horace Davis is an endorse-
ment of the administration of President McKinley. Party issues
are involved in this campaign to a greater extent than ever before
known in a municipal election. Every Republican has watched
with deepest satisfaction the marvelous progress of our country
under the wise and patriotic guidance of William McKinley. Dur-
ing the past three years from the Atlantic to the Pacific every in-
dustry has throbbed with renewed life, every enterprise has pros-
pered beyond the most sanguine expectations. California and San
Francisco stand to-day upon the threshold of an area of progress
such as has never before presented itself, and which if not taken ad-
vantage of now will never offer itself to us again. It would be little
short of criminal not to grasp the present opportunity. The defeat
of Horace Davis would be a staggering blow to the administration
that has brought about this happy condition; the Republican who
fails in his duty now helps to destroy the prosperity of the coun-
try. Let every man who has the welfare of his State and city at
heart rally to the support of Horace Davis, and thus pledge his
fealty to his party and his country.
to be kept in confinement until another
transport sails. A sentry will see that
he is not behind time again.
To-morrow thd Kansas men -will be
mustered out, and already preparations
for departure are being made. The regi
ment will ytart East on a special train
about noon on Sunday. It is a week ear
lier than was at first Intended, but poli
tics in Kansas could not stand the home
coming of the regiment and the election
at the same time, so the work of. muster
ing out was hurried along.
It was at first supposed the idea was
to get the men home in time for the elec
tion, but that was not the reason. It
was figured that if the original date wa9
adhered toâ November 3â the men would
return just on election day. There would
be a big time in Topeka, every one would
flock in from the country and the elec
tion would have to run itself. The poli
ticians of the State drafted a telegram
to the War Department, setting forth all
these facts and requesting that the dato
of mustering out be hurried or delayed so
that the home-coming of the men "would
not interfere with the voting. The an
ewer was a change in the date from No
vember 8 to October 2S.
Acting Assistant Surgeon James B.
Pascoe has been ordered to report at the

DR. FORSTER CHARGED
WITH MANSLAUGHTER
THE PILL BOX PRACTITIONER '
ARRESTED.
Result of the Inquest Into the Cause
of the I>eath of Thos. J. Malley
Upon the Operating Table.
A Coroner's jury yesterday charged Dr.
William Foreter and Dr. Donald Maclean
with manslaughter in their verdict in the
case of the death of Thomas J. Malley,
who died .on the operating table of the '
Pill Box Drug Store, 1059 Market street,
last Sunday. Dr. Forster And his clerk
were engaged in applying chloroform to
the deceased while Dr. Maclean was
about to begin an operation for phymosis.
There was present at the time Walter
McCann, a friend of the deceased. Mc-
C'ann had been a member of the United
States Hospital Corps at Manila and the
deceased was a discharged California sol
dier.
Dr. Maclean testified that Dr. Forster
administered the chloroform and kept the
patient's pulse in hand, while the witness
prepared to begin the operation. Malley
was talking while the drug was being ad
ministered and when the witness applied
a clamp Malley made an exclamation,
showing that he had not become uncon
scious. When there was a convulsive
movement of the patient's legsâ a com
mon occurrence in such cases and usually
followed by unconsciousness and insensi
bility to painâ McCann said that the pa
tient was in dangerâ that too much chlor
oform was being administered, or some
thing to that effect, but the witness did
Hot pay any attention to the remark, he
being convinced that there was no danger.
At that moment the witness asked Dr.
Forster to hand him an Instrument and
Forster left the patient for half a minute
and returned with the instrument. Then
it was that the witness noticed that the
patient was in danger, and he and Dr.
Foster Immediately set to work at induc
ing artiticial respiration, but were unsuc
cessful.
Dr. Forster admitted that his drugstore
cierk assisted him in administering the
drug. On cross-examination by Coroner
Hill, Forster admitted that he had been
summoned to appear before the Board of
Health and produce his diploma as a
doctor. He had failed to appear because
at that time he had no diploma. He suc
ceeded in getting a diploma in May of
last year.
AValter McCann testified that Forster ami
his clerk did not appear to administer the
drug skillfully and that the chloroform
was poured Oirt in such large quantities
by Forster and the clerk that the liquid
ran down the neck of the deceased. He
warned Forster about the danger, but no
attention was paid to his warning.
Dr. Forster's appearance and the manner
in which he gave his testimony created
a bad impression upon the Jury and had
much to do with the severity of their
verdict.
Forster was arrested later In the day
and was released on bonds. The case
against him will be vigorously prosecuted.
Dr. Maclean was arrested in the even
| ing and also charged with manslaughter.
Ili- wns Boon released by Judge Treadwell
on his own recognisance.

CALIFORNIA MAY
ADD A MILLION
TO HER INCOME
Commercial Outlook
for Figs.
PROFESSOR SWINGLE'S HOPES
If the Moths Now in the State Shall
Survive the Winter the State
Will Be Greatly Bene
fitted.
One million of dollars per annum can
be eusily added to the Income of Cali
fornia, In the opinion of Professor Walte*
T. Swingle of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, by cultivating ligs.
Professor Swingle has been touring the
State and keenly observing. His conclu
sion is that the foothill region of Califor
nia is excellently adapted to the growing
of fig orchards and is like the natural
home of the tig. Imported figs are now
selling on the Atlantic coast at the extra
ordinary rate of fiOOO per ton, and there
are few to- be had at that price. If Cali
fornia had a fig crop now it would be as
good as a gold mine.
"California ought to raise figs enough
for the whole United States," said Pro
fessor Swingle to a Call reporter. "I am
satisfied that the possibility of so doing
will be demonstrated satisfactorily."
The explanation of this is that \i the fig
moth, brought from Asia by Professor
Swingle in Capri ligs, shall -survive the
frosts the problem of fertilizing the figs,
which has puzzled generations of Califor
nians, will be settled. It has heretofore
been supposed that the only 'way to intro
duce the fig moth Into California was to
Import small Capri fig trees in pots and
I wait for them to grow. Professor bwin
| gle had adopted the more direct method
! and brought them In figs, the ligs being
wrapped in tin foil. A Journey across the
I Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean
and the North American continent dicr
not hurt the moth In the least. There
are many samples of the moth in the
State now, all so imported and all are
i doing well.
If the moths survive the frost this win
ter, the way will be blazed out for the fu
ture industry, which cannot but prove an
Important addition to the State's .com
mercial resources.
Professor Swingle says that he thinks
that it Is also possible to introduce the
fruit-bearing cactus into California suc
cessfully. This is something like the
prickly pear, with the "prickers" left out.
The fruit is of a dull, red color and
tastes something like a canteloupe. In
Arabia this fruit grows on the desert and
does not need any water to thrive. There
are large tracts in California, now produc
ing no revenue, that might be made to
pay well with crops of this Arabian fruit.
Professor Swingle is Investigating care
fully concerning the outlook for the date
palm in California.
The shortage in the Asiatic fig crop
ought to supply a market for any Califor
nia black figs fit to send forward this sea
son. Black dried figs have already been
sold, in small quantities, in the East, at
very good prices.
Grand Entertainment and Social.

ROBBED WHILE THE
FAMILY WERE DINING
Daring Burglary Committed in the
Western Addition by a Gang of
Clever Crooks.
Despite the ceaseless effort to capture
them, the gang of crooks who success
fully hurglarlzed the residences of Mrs.
S. 11. Proctor, 1917 Webster street; Attor
ney Barclay Henley, 2131 Green street, and
A. Maxfield, 1314 Washington street, and
' other residents last Tuesday night, are
1 still plying their nefarious calling. De
scriptions of the articles taken from the
| residences named have been given to the
I detectives, hut no trace of the valuables
1 has been revealed. The officers whoso
beats are in the Western Addition have re
ceived instructions to be on their guard
and arrest suspicious characters found in
their vicinity.
On Wednesday right the thieves re
newed their unlawful work. They en
tered the home of Robert H. Postle
thwaite, 1315 I>eavenworth street, while the
family were at dinner and boldly walked
! off with nuggets and jewelry. The rob-
I bery occurred at 7 o'clock, and was s<>
cleverly executed that it was not dis
covered until an hour later, when the
Chief of Police was notified.
The police believe two men did the
"trick, and the thoroughness with which
it was done impresses them with the
: opinion that the thieves were perfectly
acquainted with the habits of the family.
i The burglars gained access to the house
by opening the front door with a skeleton
key and then cautiously crept upstairs
1 tn the landing. While one of the fellows
1 hid In the dimly lighted hallway, watch-
Ing the family and some guest* ai dinner,
the other entered the sleeping apartments
in search of valuables. He forced open
a bureau drawer and took therefrom a
i half dozen nugget?, a gold watch and a
number of trinkets, and then continued
! his search in an adjoining apartment ior
nmro Spoil. The thief who kept watch
| evidently became frightened, uh the ser
vant girl had passed him in the hallway
lon her way to nn adjoining room. He
warned his pal and they took a hurried
1 departure, leaving the drawers wide open
I and other evidences of their visit.
When informed Of the robbery. Chief
Leefl Bent two of his men to the house,
i and they thoroughly examined the prem-
I ises, in the hope of finding the culprits.
Mrs. PostlethWalte was greatly shocked
I by the occurrence and declined to make
any statement of her losses. Last night
one lit' the family visited the Chief's office
and Inquired If a trace of the valuables
I had been found, but received a negative
i reply. Every effort will be made to cap
! ture the gang, as its operations in the
i Western Addition are becoming alarming.

11. PATRICK HENRY.
BY FREDERIC W. SPEIRS, PH. D.
Early Career.
Patrick Henry was born in 1736. He
thus reached manhood at that momentous
period of American history when events !
were shaping themselves for the great
revolution, and in that stirring drama he
was destined to play a most brilliant part.
But his earlier years gave small promise
of the distinguished service which "has
made his name familiar to all Americans.
Although he was of excellent family and
might have enjoyed good educational ad
vantages, he displayed no special aptitude
for anything except woodcraft. At 16 his
father established him In trade. This en
terprise speedily failed. And then, as one \
of his biographers puts it, "having attain
ed the ripe age of 18, and being then en
tirely out of employment, and equally out
of money, Patrick rounded out his em
barrassments and gave symmetry to
them, as it were, by getting marriedâ and i
that to a young â â â VBVBVBJ
woman quite as lm- HHVHhHhHhJ
pecunious as him- HHVHVHVHhJ
self." After his â â â â â â â â â I
marriage he tried HBVBVBVBVJ
farming, and when HHhHhHhHhJ
that ended in fail- HBSBSBSBSJ
ure he. returned to HBVBVBVBVJ
shopkeeping. His HBVBVBVBVJ
second venture In HBVBhBhBhJ
trade soon proved - I
as disastrous as the HHVHhHhHhJ
first. Thereupon
this unsuccessful HBVBVBVBVJ
and unpromising
youth decided to en- HBSBhBhBhJ
ter. the profession of I
law, and with many
misgivings on the
part of the examln
ers he was admitted
to the Virginia bar.
Thus lngloriously
began the remark
able career which
was to be crowned
by the highest hon
or attainable in the
legal professionâ the
proffer of the post
of Chief Justice of
the United States. â â â â â â â â â I
Patrick Henry
soon established the
fart that the fail
ures in trade and
agriculture were not
to be repeated in his
new venture. He
poon made a credit- |
able local reputation.
and in 1765 he was sent to the Virginia
Legislature. Immediately upon his en
trance to public life he began a career of
meteoric brilliancy and of large signifi
cance for the American colonies.
The Stamp Act.
The student of American history will
remember that the year 1765 marks the
beginning of the end of the colonial re
lations of America and England. Just be
fore this time the British Ministry began
to rigidly enforce certain navigation laws
of the previous century, which restricted
our trade for the benefit of English mer
chants. At the same time Parliament be
gan the' policy of taxing the colonies
without their consent, for the support of
a standing army. The first important
measure of taxation on the new principle,
the stamp act, was passed in 1765, and
the colonies instantly flamed into indig
nant protest.
On receipt of the news of the passage
of the act the Virginia Legislature re
solved itself into a committee of the whole
House, "immediately to consider the
steps necessary to be taken in conse
quence of the resolutions of the House
of Commons of Great Britain relative to
the charging certain stamp duties in the
colonies and plantations in America." To
obey the law was to surrender the dearly
prized right of self-governmentâ to resist
it was possibly treason. The seriousness I
of the situation was apparent to all. The
wisest counsel of the most experienced
leaders was needed at this juncture. But
to the surprise of the House the man
who presumed to speak at this crisis was
not a veteran statesman, but an un
known, uncouth young lawyer, a new
member of the Legislature. With calm j
audacity Patrick Henry proceeded to
move a. series of resolutions conceived in ]
a spirit of bold resistance to the stamp j
act. The principal resolution was as fol- !
lows: "Resolved, therefore, that the Gen
eral Assembly of this colony have the
only and exclusive right and power to
lay taxes and impositions upon the Inhab
itants of this colony; and that every*at
tempt to vest such power in any person â 
or persons' whatsoever, other than the j
General Assembly aforesaid, has a man
ifest tendency to destroy British as well
as American freedom."
The older leaders were startled by the
boldness of the attack on Parliament,
and opposed the radical resolutions with
all the force of their logic, but the young |
orator met the opposition with keen ar- !
gument and with a torrent of eloquence j
that swept the majority of the Assem
bly to his support. The famous Virginia
resolutions were adopted after a battle j
of two days. By a single speech the
young Virginian had won a place among
the leaders of public opinion in his col
ony. Patrick Henry left for home imme
diately after his victory, and on his de
parture the conservatives succeeded in j
forcing a reconsideration and a modifica
tion of the resolutions, but the sweeping j
condemnation of the stamp act embodied i
in the original resolutions had meantime '
gone out to the country. This trumpet
call of Virginia to her sister colonies *to
resist unjust taxation unquestionably ex-*
erted a profound influence.
An Individual Declaration of War.
On March 20, 1775, a convention was as
sembled in Richmond to consider means
for putting the colony in a position of
defense. It was at this convention that
Patrick Henry, speaking not to Virginia
alone, but to the whole sisterhood of col
onies, declared that the time for peace
ful negotiations had passed and the hour
had struck fur war. As a mere bit of
oratory hlfi famous speech of 1775 is nota
ble, but as an epoch-making revelation of
the unconscious sentiment of a nation
its delivery Is one of the most important
events of the revolutionary period. The
oft-quoted speech first reviewed In mas
terly fashion the attempt of the colonies
to preserve by peaceful methods the an
cient rights of Englishmen. And then,
after art inspiring presentation of the
strength of 3,000,000 of people "armed in
the holy cause of liberty," the speaker,
with all the dramatic power of his won
derful oratory, closed with the majestic
peroration so. familiar to all Americans:-
Oentlemen may cry peace, peace, but there
is nc peace. The war is actually begun. The
next gale that sweeps from the north will
brlnp to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
Our brethren are already in the field. Why
stand we here idle? What Is It that gentle
men wish? What would they have? Is life
so dear, or peace bo sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it
Almighty God! I know not what course others
may take, but as for me, give ma liberty or
give me death!
"Patrick Henry's individual declaration
of war against Grea,t Britain," as Pro
fessor Tyler terms it, made a tremendous
impression upon the country. He bad
proclaimed openly what other men of his
position of influence had whispered under
their breath, and war came, as he pre
dicted, in less than a month.
The Critical Period.
The wnr over, we approach what Mr.
John Fiske calls "the critical period of
American history." In 1777, during the
stress of war, our first form of federal
government had been devised. The
'articles of confederation provided a very
weak national government, and as soon
j as the war was over the States, which
i had been held together by the force of
I necessity as they fronted a common en
i emy, began to drift apart. Exhausted by
] a long war, weighed down by heavy mi
i debtedness, demoralized by bad money
and distracted by threatened rebellions,
the nation that had so gloriously de
i fended its liberties against England was
! In grave danger of dissolution through
! civil strife. The statesmen began to real-
I ize the necessity for a more perfect union.
PATRICK HENRY.
and in May, 1787, there assembled in
Philadelphia a body of fifty-five men
charged with the momentous task of re
vising the articles of confederation. Pat
rick Henry was not a member of the Vir
ginian delegation. He refused the most
urgent invitations to participate in the
convention, for he had come to feel that
there was danger that the proposed re
vision would make the union so strong
as to imperil the liberty of the people ol
the States.
Opposition to the Constitution.
The possible opposition of the great
Virginia leader to the ratification by his
State of the proposed constitution was a
source of great anxiety to the advocates
of the stronger union, and when the con
stitution was adopted by the convention
Washington sent him a copy, with a
strong letter urging his favorable con
sideration. Patrick Henry replied: "I
have to lament that I cannot bring my
mind in accord with the proposed consti
tution. The concern I feel on this ac
count is really greater than I am able to
express."
The Virginia convention to consider the
constitution was convened on June 2, 1788.
Madison, who is sometimes called the
"father of the constitution," in recogni
tion of his great services in the conven
tion of ITS", led with consummate ability
| a strong group of supporters. Patrick
Henry, who had thrown himself in the
contest with his usual energy, marshaled
the forces of the opposition in a masterly
attack. But the eloquence of the great
advocate did not avail. For twenty-three
days battle royal raged, and then the
constitution was ratified by a narrow ma
| jority. - c â¢
The struggle over the ratification of the
constitution was Patrick Henry's last
| great battle in the arena of politics. Dur
ing his public career his legal practice had
necessarily been neglected, and, like many
other unselfish public servants, he found
himself approaching old age with his pri
vate fortune sadly impaired. Declining a
re . e l e ction to the Governorship in 1786,
after his fifth term, he returned to his
practice and soon repaired his fortune. In
17&4 ho retired from practice with a
competency.
In Retirement.
His strenuous opposition to the consti
tution cost him the friendship of many of
his former associates, and for a time there
was a cloud between him and Washing
ton. In a letter written soon after his
1 retirement he speaks thus of his attitude
toward the Government he had tried to
modify:
Since the adoption of the present constitu
tion I have generally moved in a narrow circle.
But In that I have never omitted to inculcate
a strict adherence to the principles of it. And
I have the satisfaction to think that In no part
cf the union have the laws been more pointedly
obeyed than in that where I have resided and
spent my time. Projects, indeed, of a contrary
tendency have been hinted to me; but the
treatment of the projectors has been such as
to prevent all intercourse with them for a
long time.
In 1795 cordial relations with Washing
ton were re-established, and the President
offered hip old friend the portfolio of
State. This honor he refused, and within
a few months he was offered the highest
Judicial position within the gift of the
Presidentâ that of Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. But Patrick Henry couid
not be wooed from his retreat. He
courteously declined the Chief Justice
ship, and "within a year he also declined
the Governorship of Virginia. Two more
appeals for service reached him from the
outside world. President Adams request
ed him to act as -envoy to France at tho
crisis of our relations with the French Di
rectory, but Patrick Henry was now too
feeble to undertake the journey to Eu
rope. The last appeal was from Wash
ington, and this he honored. The violent
attacks on the administration of Adams,
which took form in the Virginia resolu
tions of 1798. had alarmed Washington,
and he asked Patrfok Henry to stand for
election to the Virginia House of. Repre
sentatives that he might "be a bulwark
against such dangerous pentiments as are
delivered there at present." The veteran
statesman consented, and emerged from
his retirement in 1799 to deliver one more
speech with much of his old-time fire. He
was duly elected, but -before the House
convened he died.
"A Mere Orator?"
Patrick Henry ranged himself against
the wisest statesmanship of hi 3 time when
he opposed the adoption of the Federal
constitution, and history has proved him
wrong. His fame has suffered severely
in consequence. Many critics have re
garded him as a mere orator of unusual
magnetism and fire, and have denied him
th* higher qualities of statesmanship, but
later research is tending to confirm the
opinion of his contemporary, John Adams
who asserted that he was a man ' of deep
reflection, ket>n sagacity, clear foresight.
dYriRK enterprise, inflexible .intrepidity
jand untaTnted integrity, with an ardent
! zeal for the liberties, the honor and felic
i ity of his country and his species.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. Wheat opened steady
and scored a %c advance over last night's close ]
during the first hour's trading. Early news was
generally of a bearish cast, but shorts were j
nervous over the situation in South Africa, and :
commenced covering from the start. _ The
strength in corn also encouraged buying, and as j
offerings were scarce the upturn whs easily
accomplished. December opened %c higher at
70%#76%c and advanced' to 71Uc. At the lat- â¢
ter figure, however, a good deal of long wheat
was thrown on the market and a reaction to
7'Vi"" T foljtiwed. The latter part of the ses
sion wae extremely dull, with the price barely
holding at 70 7 /i(jp7lc. and finally closing with
buyers at 70"(,c. Indications of an increase of
1 500,000 bushels In the domestic visible during
the week and reports of complete relief in the
drought-stricken sections had a depressing In
fluence after the early trading.
Corn was strong and active. â¢ A report by an
authoritative statistician that the early esti
mates of this year's yield must be materially
reduced. owing to disapyolntlng husking re
turns, was the chief buying motive, The mar
ket advanced steadily until near the close, when
selling by shippers and profit-taking caused a
Blight â eaetlon. December closed at 32c.
Oats were' dull, but held steady In sympathy
with corn. December advanced to 22;&c. The
advance in corn strengthened provisions early,
but the market yielded under heavy liquidation
near the end and the advance was all lost.
January pork closed 2%c lower, January lard
unchanged and January ribs a shade lower. "-.

crosbreds were In active demand at hid ad
vance, and finest merinos In some cases %d

Continent was a buyer of the best grades. The
general strength was due to the shortness of

PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 26.â There Is very lit
tle wheat offering at present prices, neither
growers nor ship owners showing a disposition
to make concessions sufficient to admit of busi
ness being done. Some exporters quote as low
as SS'ijf^'^c for Walla "Walla, but admit that
they cannot secure wheat at those figures. Val
ley is nominally 57@5Sc.
The committee met to-day and established the
grades to be used In Oregon, Washington an.l
Idaho this season at 5S pounds for No. 1 Walla
Walla and blue stem.
They did not fix the grade for valley, but it
will probably be' the same as Walla Walla, A
standard price was agreed on of 1 cent per
bushel less for 57-pound wheat and 2 cents per
bushel less for 56-pound. Action regarding
lighter grades Is left to the Judgment of the
buyer. .

r>ry Hay is getting: to be a scarce article.
as most of the arrivals are wet and not wanted
by buyers. Reports from the country Bay that
the presses are baling Hay from wet stack*,
â¢which indicates wK Hay for this market for
some time to come. In order to obtain dry
Hay the local merchants are breaking into
country warehouse stocks, which is much
earlier than usual, and Indicates a higher
market later on. There Is no quotable advance,
but the feeling is stiff and prices are likely
to improve any day. The rain was a bless
ing to every farmer whose Hay was under
cover. -
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Receipts of - Hay still continue quite light,
the total for the week being' somewhat less
than 3000 tons, about the same amount as for
the week preceding. There is still con
siderable-trouble in securing cars in
the â¢ country, and this fact, together
with the stormy weather, has kept shipments
down to this small amount. Wet and dam
aged hay continues to arrive in quite large
quantities, and until this is all cleared off
the market there will be no material change
In the present range of prices. All this kind
of Hay is being sold at very low prices, but
anything that is choice, whether it be. wheat
or oat, brings good figures. (
"Receipts of Hay on the San Francisco mar
ket from July 1, 1899, to October 1, 1899. were
67 274 tons in comparison with 69,558 tons for
the same period in the year 189 S. This shows
an increase of about 8000 tons for the present
season.
"Again we .note another advance in the price
of bale. rope. We now quote for three-strand
Manila mixed, 14Vic per pound, and for two

The market Is kept demoralized by the Im
mense receipts of Eastern, some, ten cars or so !
having come In this week. This beats the

selling at $2 2503, hence it will be seen that ;
California Poultry has little chance against
such odds. Hens and Turkeys, however, are
firm, hut young stock is demoralized.

SEVEN ROOMS
SATURATED WITH
KEROSENE OIL
Attempted Arson at
Golden Gate.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 26.
The old Bishop saloon, a large three
story building at Golden Gate, was dis
covered to be on fire early this morning.
After the flames were extinguished and
an investigation made Hubert Bishop, the
owner, and his son, 11. .L. Bishop, were
placed under arrest.
The lire was discovered by Officer Lay
ton, who turned in an alarm, mill the ae
yartment soon had the blaze put out be-'
lore much damage was done. Inside the
house the most elaborate and complete
preparations were discovered for causing
the destruction of the building. There
are fourteen rooms in the house, and in
seven of these the floors, the walls, the
furniture and even the ceilings were sat
urated with kerosene. Little pools of oil
were found standing on the floor In sev
eral places. Bo that everything might con
nect and insure one big blaze with the
least possible delay, holes had been bored
through the floors in the rooms in the
upper story, through which oil had been
poured on the ceilings of the rooms below.
Fire Chief Ball, after carefully noting
the condition' of the house, caused the
arrest of the Bishops.
Oniccr Layton, who first saw the flames,
heard a report like a pistol shot in the
house, and at once went to Investigate.
Some time ago the place was a saloon, but
foi some months a large part of it has
been unoccupied. As soon as the officer
reached the saloon part which was on fire
he noticed that the barn, which is many
feet away, was also on fire, BO he rang
ill-- bells of the neighbors to warn them
of the danger. Layton tried to arouse
the inmates of the Bishop house, but no
one responded, so he threw himself
against the door of the saloon and burst
it In. Inside everything was on fire, the
flame seeming to come from beneath the
counter. Stronger than the smoke was
the smell of kerosene, and the officer lost
no time in calling out the department.
In one of the rooms upstairs Robert
Bishop was found, and claimed to be
asleep. Within a few feet of his bed were
found holes bored in the floor, with pools j
<>f kerosene, and a pair of rubbers which j
had been used to walk over the oiled floor, i
Ho told Chief Ball that he did not know
how the kerosene had been distributed
all over his house, He also said that he
had been robbed of (160 and that the rob
bers had probably tried to destroy the
evidence of their crime, intending that he
also should be a victim. Bishop's son,
who was also in the house, claimed that
he was asleep when the fire was discov- !
ered. The home and barn were insured
for $2500.

SMALL BOY CONVICTED
OF A HEINOUS CRIME
OAKLAND, Oct. X.â A peculiar spec
tacle of the unexpected things a jury will
do ITU afforded to-day in Judge Hall's
court, when a verdict of "guilty as charg
ed," was brought in by a jury in the
of Freddie Canning, aged 12 years, charg
ed with criminally assaulting Maggie Ew
ing. aged 9 years. The case occupied the
past three days in court and the testi
mony was almost entirely that given by
little children.
It was the general opinion, even on the
part of the District Attorney, that a ver
dict of simple assault would be brought
in, and the verdict, therefore, was a de
cided surprise to everybody except the
juror*! who were: H. Hermanson, Hector
M.TiiFon, J. C. Stanley, William Frathen,
s. Oordon, J. Wolfren, J. F. Ford, L. H.
Hr;;;ts, M. T. Sequira. F. M. Burnham,
li. 1". Eber and J. O. Armyer.
When the verdict was read the accused
boy, evidently realizing the seriousness of
the occasion for the first time, broke
down In tears. He was ordered into the
custody of the Sheriff and next Wednes
day was set as the time for pronouncing 1
sentence. The minimum penalty is four
years In a State prison.
The father of the convicted lad declares
that if a new trial is denied the case will
be appealed and that he proposes to fight
There is especially one wonderful feature
noticeable In her playing. Every musician
knows* that in order to obtain a sharp
and clear staccato a violinist must use a
limbor wrist, that Is to say, he musi play
with his hand only. Bada, however, plays
;to with a stiff wrist and uses her
wholo nether arm and still obtains as
~e and sharp a staccato as the most
rienoed violinist. This is a feat which
! I have not yet seen of any one, and
, how she does it is a mystery t.> ni<-. Par
ticular attention should be paid to the ef
fective manner In which eh-^ played "Ben
Bolt" and "The Suanee River." It was
j the acme of refined execution. Any
musician who desires to hear elegant
playing should not miss hearing the lit
tle girl, for she will one of these days be
heard from on the concert stage.

j duties, the greeting was necessarily de
j layed until last evening. Dr. Garrett lost
j nothing by waiting, however. The ladies
had used their best efforts to make the
! affair a success and their labors were
amply rewarded by the pleasure that thp
excellent and entertaining programme
i they had provided gave their reverend
KU'-St.
The polished floors of the Sunday-school
w>re covered with soft Turkish mats,
strings of rare fiowers were twined around
the. stately pillars and bright lights shone

t bid their new pa.Â«tor welcome.
The following musical programme was
excellently rendered and was followed by
a light supper: Vocal selectionsâ Mrs.
; Richards, Miss Agnes Simpson and Miss
| Kirby; violin solo, Miss Van Wyck; vocal
solosâ Frank Coffin and Mr. Girard.
The committee of arrangements that
had the reception In charge was composed
of the following named ladies: Mrs.
Philip Caduc, Mrs. James Rugglos, Mrs.
George Buckingham, Mrs. (ieneral Bab
cock. Miss Heath, Miss Field and Miss
Hoyt. The music was under the direction
of Wallace Sabin.

KILLED BY AN ENGINE.
Joseph Wilson Stepped in Front of
an Approaching Train.
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 26.-Joseph
"Wilson, who resides In old San Bernar
dino, was struck by a motor engine which
left Redlands for this city this morning.
The road passes along the street In front
of Wilson's house and Wilson stepped
from behind a clump of trees In front of
the engine, not seeing or hearing it as
he was very deaf. His head and body
Were badly crushed and he lived but a
short time. Wilson had a similar acci
dent a year ago and was slightly injured.
A short time since he drove on the track
in front of an approaching train. His
wagon was smashed and he was thrown
quite a distance. The engineers, knowing
his peculiarities, watched for him, but
this time he reached the middle of the
track before he was seen. Brakes were
applied but it was too late. No blame
Is attached to the railroad employes.
"Wilson was one of the early pioneers and
well known throughout this section.

LIFE MYSTERY
OF JOHN VIRGIL
STILL UNSOLVED
Heirs to Claim His
No
Wealth.
Oakland Office Sar^ Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 20.
When John A. Virgil, an aged hermit
whose antecedents and means of gaining
a livelihood had always been a mystery,
died In his cabin at Miles, about last
Christmas time., he left an estate that
was appraised at 17788. Shortly after his
death W. 1!. Knight, then Public Admin
istrator, obtained letters and took charge
of the estate, which consisted of $4154 25
in the hands of the administrator; $2752 85
on deposit m the Hibernia Bank, San
Francisco; three lots at Niies of estimat
ed value in the administrator's petition
at $800, and some jewelry and personal
effects
Late this afternoon ex-Public Adminis
trator Knight, by his attorney, G. E. de
Golia, filed tie first account in the ''State,
showing thai v. claim >>f 13130, presented
by Dr. G. K. Chalmers, sued upon, ha<l
been reduced by Judge Oguen. in a judg
ment recently rendered, to $2144 50; and
that there now remains a balance in the
hands of the administrator to the amount
of $4152 3u, tor which no heirs can be
found.
Among the many papers found in \ ir
gil's cabin none bore testimony that
might lead to an unraveling of the her
mit's past life, except that it was found
that in his \ounger dajs he was an or
phan and had been an inmate of an or
phan asylum at St. Augustine. Florida.
The administrator spared no efforts to
learn mon about decedent's past, in the
hope of locating an heir, bui all efforts
were of no avail.
From tin- records of the St. Augustine
orphan asylum It was learned, however,
that neaily seventy years ago an infant
was brought there by an unkiown
woman who gave the name of Virgil and
the child was afterward named John A.
Virgil. There was no record of a father.
Later the boy had been taken into the
custody and care of a prominent physi
cian, who also since died, and about nt'ty
years ago Virgil came to California. The
records of Alameda County show that
twenty-five years ago Virgil purchased
from the late Charles Crocker two town
lots at Niles, directly adjoining the pres
ent site of the Niles Postortice. There
Virgil led the life of a hermit. No one
knew whence came the money that sus
tained him until it was one day discov
ered that he had on deposit in San Fran
cisco banks something like $15,000, but
how he obtained this was all a mystery
and it was noted that the hermit was
always concealing his identity for some
reason unknown to the outside world.
Included in his estate were several Gov
ernment bonds.
When in the latter part of 1895 Virgil
suffered a stroke of paralysis. Dr. Chal
mers attended him, believing he was a
pauper. Later Virgil was taken to the
German Hospital and for a time rallied.
In December, IS9S, he suffered the fatal
stroke that carried him off at the age of
70 years.
In view of the fact that after nearly a
year's chase in pursuit of heirs none
have been found, the balance of the
estate, now in the hands of the adminis
trator, will probably go to replenish the
State school fund.
ROBBED BY HER
NEWLY WED HUSBAND
Illinois Woman Bunkoed by a Clever
Swindler From the State
of New York.
ROCHESTER. N. V., Oct. 26.â Mrs.
Mary Jane Colthar, aged 45 years, of Bun

they met in Indianapolis and the same

Before going, however, Mrs. Colthar
placed a $2000 mortgage on the farm and
drew $2100 from the bank. The trio ar
rived In Rochester a few days ago and
Monroe proposed to engage in the drug
business and prevailed upon his wife to
loan him $4075 and started for New York,
ostensibly to purchase a stock for the
store. Monroe has not been seen since.
On Wednesday Mrs. Colthar received a
letter from him in New York, saying he
had been robbed and advising her to re
turn to Bunker Hill. Mrs. Colthar, re
alizing that she had been deceived, imme
diately laid the case before Chief Cleary,
who has taken steps to catch the man.
Mrs. Colthar has found employment as a
nurse here.

TWENTY DOLLARS FOR
A CHANGE OF LUCK
OAKLAND, Oct. 26.â Harry Richards, a Fruitvale butcher, will not again
be in a hurry to feel the curly locks on a colored boy's head in or
der to change his luck. Richards' last experiment cost him just $20
in an East Oakland Justice Court this morning. A few days ago Rich
ards met two colored boys named Meadows. He went up to the smaller of
the boys and took off his cap. then rubbed the little fellow's head with
his other hand. The little fellows protested strongly against such an indig
nity, whereupon Richards exhibited the butt of a revolver that was in hiÂ«
pocket. The boys afterward secured the arrest of Richards on the charge
of carrying concealed weapons.
Richards took the witness stand this morning in his own behalf and testi
fied that he had merely taken off the boy's cap because he had been told
that if he rubbed his fingers through a colored boy's hair it would change
his luck. He admitted exhibiting the revolver, but said it was not loaded
and he had no intention of using it. Justice Larue found the defendant
guilty of Simple assault, told him that such jokes were very reprehensible
and fined him $20.
REGENT DENICKE'S
GENEROUS OFFER
Starts a Fund for Increasing the
Library of the New University
â¢.;â ';. of California.
BERKELEY, Oct. 26.â Regent Ernst A.
Denlcke of the University, of California
is the first to respond to President
Wheeler's appeal for a fund to increase
the" facilities of the university library. In
his address before the thousands as
sembled to witness his inauguration yes
terday afternoon, the new president de
plored the lack of adequate financial, sup
port from which the library suffers.
"Instead of. 75,000 volumes we want
200,000," said President Wheeler, "and in
stead of one or. two thousand dollars spent
annually for new books, we want from
twenty to thirty thousand; and we want
it right now." The request appears to
have aroused interest in the subject of
the library immediately, for to-day Re
gent Denicke sent over the first contribu
tion for a fund to be raised for the pur
pose. It was a generous donation of
$1000. . .
Repent Denicke's gift was accompanied
by the following letter: V . i
My Dear President "Wheeler: No one who
heard your eloquent address this afternoon
could help being moved thereby. You empha
size that the most urgent need was more books
for the library and a fit building to put them
In. I see no reason why the citizens of this
State, from their private means, should not at
once supply the requisite amount of money.
I am sure that It is but necessary for some
one to start the movement, and I therefore au
thorize you to draw on me for $1000, as my con
tribution to a library fund. Tours very faith
fully, ERNST A. DENICKE.
INCISED WOUND ON AN
EYEBALL SEWED UP
OAKLAND. Oct. 28.â George Bakar, one
ol the three-year-old twin sons of Philip
Bakar. the butcher, met with a very pain
ful mishap at his home. 317 Fifth street,
this afternoon, which necessitated a very
delicate and exceptionally skillful opera
tion. The child, while running ufter his
father, fell on the sidewalk with an ink
bottle in his hand. The bottle broke and
its jagged edges cut a deep ga?h under
the child's left eye, extending from trie
inner cornet to the point of the nose, lay
ing the nostril open, and also inflicting an
incision on the eyeball. Thechlld was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, and it was at
iirst proposed that the eyeball be removed.
lus Stratton and Porter, however, called
in Dr. R. <J. Thomas, the eye specialist.
nnd instead the incised wound on the eye
ball was sewed up, the water having not
all left the ball. The eyesight, however,
is practically destroyed.

REPORT OF LAND
COMMISSIONER
Losses by Fire for Year
About $20,000,000.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
â WASHINGTON. Oct. 28.-The annual
report of Commissioner Binger Hermann
of the General Land Office, made public
to-day, shows a grand total of 329,309,063
acres of unappropriated and reserved
public lands In the United State*. The
disposals of. public lands during the fiscal
year show an Increase of 738,556 acres as
compared with the 'aggregate of the pre
vious year. The total cash receipts of
the service increased $792,142 over iast
year. Original homestead entries showed
a decrease of 28.970 -acres In area Involved.
There were 160,504 acres certified or
patented as swamp lands during the year,
an increase cf almost 54,000. Indian ana
miscellaneous land patents issued aggre
gated 212,848 acres and 420.760 acres se
lected by the various States and Terri
tories were approved and certified for
educational and other purposes. Under
the several railroad grants made by Con
gre"ss there were certified patented last
year 504,671 acres of land, together with
00,392 acres for wagonroad | construction.
The Commissioner made a number of I
returns looking to the betterment of the
land, and suggests the enlargement of
Mount Rainier National Park in Wash
ington, und the Yellowstone National
Park in Wyoming. Protection against
fires is especially urged. It is estimated
that the average yearly loss from this
cause is not less than $20,000,000. The
popular utilization of the grazing lands
on the public domain is also urged, and
it is pointed out that so long as the land
laws require millmen and other lumber
men to pay a fair price to the Govern
ment for timber supplies drawn from
public lands there should be an equal
charge levied on the grazing products of J
public lands. The Government, It Is
urged, should derive a revenue from leas
ing such lands. The adjustment of the
Northern Pacific grants shows 36,570,099
acres as the quantity of lands to which
that company is entitled, and there is
still due the company 14,851,832 acres.
The whole area of that grant to the
Union Pacific is found to be 12,129,842
acres, of which 5,153,646 acres are still
due. â  The whole area of the grant to the
St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba
Company is 1,287.228 acres, and the com
pany has actually received an excess of
10,975 acres. The adjustment of the
Northern Pacific grant shows there was
a deficiency of more than half a million
acres by. the grant of May, 1878. A
deficiency also may be found of the grant
of 1884. â  ~-
COMTE THE WINNER.
Secures a Verdict Against His Assail
ant, Jules Godeau.
"Pas parceque je l'aime; mafs parceque
Je hais," translated by the bailiff, Monsieur
Cooper, and concurred in by Interpreters
Gagan and Dunker, to be words no other
than "not because I love you, but be
cause I hate you." were attached to the
tune of "Because I love you," and
hummed between the teeth of M. Osmin
Comte during the deliberation of the jury
that was to pass judgment on his assail
ant, Jules S. Godeau, undertaker. Later,
when the Jury gave judgment in Comte's
favor for $100 for his suffering, his woe,
the tune, ceased, a smile crept from be
neath his damaged nope and an expres
sion escaped his lips that sounded
strangely like "Vive .la justice." "A bas,
Comte; a bas," came from the other side;
the jury was paid off and the case was
closed.
The jury retired to deliberate on a ver
dict shortly before noon yesterday and at
2 o'clock came into court for instructions.
The members wanted to know if a nom
inal verdict with costs could be entered In
favor of the plaintiff, or if a nominal ver
dict was entered it would carry costs.
The court instructed the jury that mat
ters of this kind were not to be con
sidered by the 'Jury', and sent them out
for further deliberation. Finally the bell
announced that a verdict had been
reached and the judgment was recorded
as stated. A stay of thirty days was
granted at defendant's request.

PACIFIC CABLE
IS DISCUSSED
Goverrunent May Lay
the Line Shortly.
Special "Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26.â 1n diplomatic
and official quarters attention Is being
directed to the question of a Pacific cable
linking this country with the Philippines
and points beywnd, and it is understood
this Government and the foreign govern
ments which would be affected by the
cable are now actively considering the
subject.
The officials hÂ«re are assembling data
and preparing cable maps with the ex
pectation that the matter will be brought
to the early attention of Congress. In
a general way the project is for a cable
of four links, via: From San Francisco
to Hawaii, 2160 rrriles; from Hawaii to
Wake Island. v 2044 miles; from Wake Is
land to Guam, 1293 miles; from Guam to
Manila, 1350 miles.
These landing points are all within the
] control of the Uniaed States, our flag
j having been raised on Wake Island not
long ago. This would connect all the
j American possessions in the Pacific by
| a line crossing no foreign territory- Be
sides this the plan permits of an expan
sion so as to secure two outlets to Asia
and the Far East. The first of these
would be from Manila to the Japanese
island of Formosa, from which island
Japan has built a line to the Japanese
coast and the mainland of Asia. The sec
ond outlet would be from Hawaii south
to Farmings Island, at which point the
newly projected British cable from Van
couver to New Zealand crosses.
The foregoing projects would not be
private enterprises, but a Government
undertaking. The Government, it la urged
In support of the project, would be not
I only free from the present high charges
| and from the supervision of foreign com
i panics now handling the business, but the
line being opened to the public and com
mercial uses at a reasonable rate would
afford facilities for the expanding trade
j of the Pacific and thereby yield a coa
siderable return to the Government.
Foreisrn governments which would be
affected by this projectâ notably Russia,
I Japan and Great Britainâ are beginning
i to show some concern over It and It is
I understood that the Government has been
I sounded of late from several foreign
quarters to learn what its plans are.

HORACE DAVIS LEADS IN THE
RACE FOR MAYOR.
Cleveland Talks
to Old Time
Democrats.
THE municipal campaign is In full
swing. The Populists and Free Sil
ver Democrats who follow the
standard of William Jennings
Bryan rallied at Metropolitan Tem
ple last night and listened to their
local leader, Dr. C. D. Cleveland, the Peo
ple's party nominee for Mayor. Dr. Cleve
land expounded the principles of Democ
racy as taught by Thomas Jefferson. He
pointed out the false pretenses of the Phe
lan-McNab Democrats in claiming that
the new charter was an Issue in the cam
paign. He made it clear to his audience
that the charter wan adopted by the peo
ple, ratified by the Legislature and de
clared valid by the Supreme Court; that
It was the local constitution of San Fran
cisco and could only be changed by the su
preme intelligence of the people,
Horace Davis, the Republican leader in
the local contest. Is conducting a gallant
campaign and everywhere receiving the
applause of the people. Republicans who
voted for Phelaji last November are daily
falling into line under the banner of Ho
race Davis. Republican districts which
gave but a slender majority for Mr. Pat
ion last year will roll up tremendous ma
jorities for Horace Davis on November 7.
Great activity prevails at the headquar
ters of the Republican County Committee
Â«and at the rooms of the Horace' Davis
Central Club. Reports received from the
eighteen Assembly districts are highly en
couraging. The downtown merchants are
ml little slow m responding to the demands
of party duty. Business la so brisk under
the Republican administration of national
jaffairs that many of the merchants can-
Tiot spare time to consider the impor
tance of local affairs. Should the party
â which Phelan trains with get the reins
of power in this county the merchants
would not have business enough. at their
etores to divert their attention from poli
tics.
Horace Davis and his associates on the
Republican ticket will receive another
popular ovation at Metropolitan Temple
to-morrow night. It is known that United
States Senator George C. Perkins and
Irving M. Scott will address the audience,
and the County Committee may be able
to announce before to-morrow that ex-
S^nator Charles N. Felton will speak to
the people.
Last evening at headquarters of the
Horace Davis Central Club, 723 Market
street, a general meeting of the Republi
can .County Committee was held. An in
terchange of views on the progress of the
campaign was a feature of the assembly.
Reports of Increased activity all along the
line were presented. It was resolved to
furnish the Election 1 Commissioner with
the names of capable men to till the quota
of Republican officers of election.
The subject of Tilling the vacancy in the
Interstate Commerce Commission was
considered. Dr." Dalzell introduced the
following resolution, which was adopted:
Whereas, There now exists a vacancy In the
Interstate Commerce Commission, which va
cancy f? to be filled by appointment by the
President: and whereas, the present Republican
County Committee of the city and county of
San Francisco was created by a convention,
the delegates to which were elected under cir
cumstances, hitherto unprecedented, the Bald
election being held under the recently enacted
State primary law: and whereas, every vote
was cast - â : 1 counted under general super
vision, thus ridding the election of the per
nicious influence of the boss element and there
by making this County Committee truly repre
sentative of the Republican party of this city;
and whereas, there has never been any appointee
from thin great Pacific Coast upon the above
mentioned Interstate Commerce Commission,
therefore, be it â¢
lived. That this County Committee, speak
ing for the Republican party of the city and
county of San Francisco, and feeling that the
Pacific Coast is Justly entitled to a representa
tive upon paid Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, do hereby respectfully and most earnestly
urirp the President to fill the vacancy referred
to by the appointment of a representative from
the Pacific Coast; and be It further

I had been troubled with tetter for several
years. At times my hands would be sore all over,
bo that I could not uÂ»e them at all, and were so
tender that clear water, even, smarted like fire,
and it spread over arms, neck, and face. I had
been treated by physicians, but without benefit,
when I began the Cuticuea remedies. I found
relief before I had taken thefirtt bottle. I used
three or four bottles of Ccticura Resolvrnt,
one cake of Cuticura Soap, and one box of

In the Thirty-third Assembly District
there will be a great rally at Masonic
Hall, corner of Fourteenth and Railroad
avenues, South San Francisco. The peo
ple in that quarter of the city desire to
hear Hon. Frank McGowan, hence at the
request of the County Committee he prom
ises to addrtss the audience to-night. The
mere announcement that he will speÂ£k
will convene a large audience in the
Thirty-third District. Horace Davis, A.
P. Van Duzer and others will address the
voters.
A meeting will be held to-night at Teu
tonia Hall, Howard street, between Ninth
and Tenth, under the auspices of
that excellent and progressive organiza
tion, the American Scandinavian Republi
can i'lub. Brilliant speakers will address
the throng.
Another Republican club meeting will
take place to-night at 638 Folsom street.
Gifted speakers will address the audi
ence.
The readiness with which the working,
men of the city are rallying to the sup
port of Horace Davis Is gratifying to the
County Committee. The splendid service
which Horace Davis has performed in be
half of the working men of San Fran
cisco will ever be remembered by the hon
est sons of toil. He. made one of the man
liest fights ever waged in the Congress of
the United States to protect the working
men from Asiatic competition in the Reids
of labor. It is quite natural, therefore,
that the loyal and honest workingmen 01
San Francisco should rally to hits support
in this campaign. The interests of labor
In San Francisco will be safe with Horace
Davis in the Mayor's chair. He will
economize by dismissing a gang of tax
eaters and will not be found naggling
over little bills and advocating that
tho wages of lamplightere should be re
duced. Horace Davis cannot afford to
pass around $500-checks just before elec
tion, but he can afford to give the work
ingmen Justice.
Horace Davis Is the same man north
of Market street that he is the south of
the great thoroughfare. He is a Repub
lican both day and night on either side
of the street. Demagogues who fancy
that workingmen are dullards go Into one
district and talk free silver to catch the
Bryan vote and then whisk about to an
other district and talk of the advantages
of sound money to a commercial com
munity. Horace DaviÃ is not that kind
of a man. He advocates sound money for
everybody.
Horace Davis Is known far and wide,
and the present municipal contest in San
Francisco Is talked of in the leading
newspapers of the United States. This
paragraph is taken from the Boston Tran
script of October 9, 1899:
"The Republican candidate for Mayor
of San Francisco is Horace Davis, son of
the late 'Honest John,' once Governor of
Massachusetts. If he is as good a man
as his father was, San Francisco is for
tunate in her opportunity."
San Francisco Is fortunate in her op
portunity to support Horace Davis for
Mayor. He is a clean, sincere man of
character, and he is young enough to
make a* vigorous a campaign as his rich
opponent wants to run up against. Some
Bneers have been thrown at Horace Davis
by the Phelanltes because he teaches a
Bible 'iass on Sundays. Doubtless the
purpose of the fling was to excite a saloon
prejudice against Mr. Davis, but that
purpose happily will not be served. Hap
pily thousands of men who keep saloons
and frequent saloons respect the Bible
and the Sunday-school and hold that it Is
right and proper that their children
should not be lacking in that respect.
HORACE DAVIS CLUB.
The Horace Davis riub of the Forty
third Assembly District had a rally last
evening. Horace Davis addressed the
club and advised hard and systematic
work. "We are going to win out," he
paid, "and we are going to succeed only
by hard work." He also spoke at length
on the issues of the campaign. San Fran
cisco had prcfitt-d largely by the prosper
ity brought to the entire country by the
wise prudent and conservative policy and
administration of President McKlnley. He
did not believe that San Francisco would
announce to the world on the 7th of No
vember that it was either ungrateful or
lacked the sense to see whence It
had received its prosperity. San Fran
cisco was entering into a new era of mu
nicipal government. Republicans wished
the administration to be businesslike and
sensible, and the voters could safelj
elude that the men who have managed
their own business affairs with common
and success would carry the same
methods into the public business. Mr.
Davis was ' frequently Interrupted with
applause in a long and -businesslike talk.

THIRTY-SIXTH DISTRICT.
The Republicans of the Thirty-sixth As
sembly District held a meeting last night
at the junction of Twenty-eighth and
Church streets, at which there was a large
and enthusiastic gathering- of voters. The
meeting was Republican in every sense
of the word, as the nominees received
a most flattering encore to their short
addresses. President Frank French of
the regular club presided at the meeting.
Hon. Horace Davis was tne first Bpeaker
of the evening, and the manner in which
he was received showed on its face that
he will get a handsome majority of the
votes of Eureka Valley. He spoke <>n th"
necessity of improvements for the Mis
sion district, including the necessity for
a leading sewer from Ocean View which
would tap the southwestern section. A
full and united support of all the parts
of the new charter would be faithfully
carried out by him when he becomes
Mayor of this gr'-:it and growing city.
He briefly reviewed the wants of the city
and pledged himself to administer â¢ the
business of the municipality with as much
care as he would that of his own indi
vidual interests. 'lit: received a rousing
cheer on the conclusion of his remarks.
The mating was addressed by Dr. K. N.
Torello, N. Blbo, W. Watson. 8. Foster,*
Thomas L. Henderson. Dr. Charles Box
ton and W. C. Johnson, all Supervisorial
nominees. Following these came A. P.
Black, nominee for District Attorney;
James L. Nagle, nominee for Police
Judge; Dr. A. D. McLean, nominee for
Coroner; W. Z. Tlffney, nominee for Re
corder; John Farnham, nominee for Pub
lic Administrator; A. P. Van Duser, E.
Myron Wolf and Major C. W. Kyle.
NEW REPUBLICAN
CLUB ORGANIZED
The hall at ism Polk street was crowded
with enthusiastic Republicans last night.
The object of the meeting was to organ
ize a Forty-first Assembly District Repub
lican Club. The meeting was called to
order by Nathan Frank, who acted as
chairman during the early part of the
evening, but being called away on busi
ness Sydney Ehrman was unanimously
elected his successor. The members dem
onstrated great enthusiasm, and several
of them volunteered to make a personal
house-to-house canvass throughout the
district, which offer was accepted. An
exectitive committee was formed and' a
general meeting and grand rally has been
called for next Thursday evening.
SWEDISH-AMERICAN CLUB.
An informal reception was tendered to
a few of the Republican nominees at a
social banquet In Pythian Hall last night
fay the Swedish-American Society. The

DAVIS ON THE CHARTER.
A rousing rally was held last night by
the Republican Club of the Twenty-ninth
Assembly District at its headquarters at
140 Fourth street. The chief speaker of
the evening was, of course, Horace Da
vis, and it was with difficulty that he
spoke at all, so loud and long was 'the
cheering that greeted him upon his en
trance. Mr. Davis' speech was not one of
length, but in what there was of it he set
every true issue of the present campaign
squarely before his hearers and nailed the
Democratic fallacies that have been hand
ed round so high that no voter in the dis
trict will fail to see them from now until
election day.
Mr. Phelan's pretensions to being father
and mother to the charter and sire oÂ£
about every other civic reform ever set
on foot In the city he disposed of easily
and to the entire satisfaction of every
man in the hall. "Mr. Phelan as Mayor
was ex-offlcio a member of the charter
convention," said Mr. Davis. "I was a
member from the beginning and worked
as hard as did Mr. Phelan in framing that
instrument. After we had it framed 1
spoke in its favor and I worked for it .is
hard as I could when It came up before a
Republican Legislature for ratification. It
was framed by Republicans, voted for by
Republicans and made a law by Repub
licans, and yet our Democratic friends
tell us it Is a Democratic instrument and
Mr. Phelan's pot measure at that. "
Colonel Eddy followed Mr. Davis with
one of his customary telling speeches,

the speaker called upon Silver Democrats to ecratch him and his crew at
the polls. . . â  ; N.iV. '
J. M. Caster was chairman of the meeting, which, as expected, was
not crowded. There were, however, more than 600 voters in the house when he
called it to order, and the rapt attention for the greater part of the meet-
Ing paid to the utterances of the speakers spoke well. for the earnestness of
the audience.
George D. Gillespie, a Silver Democrat, wae the first speaker. He called
attention to the fact that the convention that nominated Phelan and Dodge
had refused absolutely to adopt the Chicago platform, which, while it was
good enough tor Bnyan find Maguire and all Silver Democrats, was not good
enough for Phelan. That repudiation, he said, was the reason for the desire
of the Democratic nominee* for cryintr out against the raising of national is
feues in this campaignâ they did not want attention directed to their apostasy
from the political creed of William Jennings Bryan and the great mass of
Democratic voters.
Dr. c. D. Cleveland, nominee for Mayor of the People's and Silver
Democratic parties; was the next spenker. TTe compared his record as a
Democrat with that of Phelan, proclaiming that he was a Jeffersonian long
before tin- present Mayor made his debut into this vale of tears. He called
attention of the voters to the Phelanite repudiation of Democratic free sil
ver and denied that the new charter was the work of the Mayor.
"There is no issue whatever about the charter, " said Dr. Cleveland. "It
was the work of the people, not the work of Phelan. It was the work of
the people, and the people alone can change it."
John Aubrey Jones talked along the same lines and called the attention of
the big D'sâ the Phelanitesâ that in repudiating the Chicago platform they
had arrayed against them the little D'sâ the Silver Democratsâ who would
pile* up votes against them on election day.
Joseph H. Scott, Republican nominee for Tax Collector, and Nathan Bibo.
Republican candidate for Supervisor, both indorsed by the People's party]
made short' addresses, and the meeting closed.
and he in turn was followed by C. H.
Jackson, nomlnco for City and County
Attorney. Andrew Branch, secretary of
the County Committee, made one of the
most eloquent speeches of tho evening,
dealing well with not only the national
but the municipal issues which figure in
the fight. It was the opinion of his hear
ers that Mr. Branch .should he given
moro time on the stump ;md l^ss aÂ»t hla

Joachimsen and I/ewls A. Gibbons also
spoke and were well received.
A BLACK CLUB.
The Republicans of the lowor md of thft
Thirty-first Assembly District met last
night at Collins Hall, Dore and Bryant
streets, and organized an Alfred P. Black
Club for the purpose of furthering Mr.
Black's candidacy for the office of Dis
trict Attorney. The following officers
were duly elected: President, James J.
Graham: first vice president, Con Daly;
treasurer. Joseph Kennedy; secretary,
Michael Mullln; sergeant at arms, John
Rtilly. About eighty of the voters of the
district signed the club roll and pledged
themselves 'to support and vote for Mr.
Black for District Attorney. Attorney
John W. Koch addressed the club on the
benefits of the new charter and eulogized
Mr. Black for his services as Assistant
District Attorney for the past eight years
in tho Superior Court. The club then ad
journed with three cheers for Mr. Black.
The next regular meeting will be on the
30th of this month at Collins Hall.

Dissatisfaction, with local nominations
â Â»howed itself last night at a mass-meet
ing of Democrats of the Thirty-sixth
kasembly District, held at Twenty-second
and Castro Btreeti. Resolutions were
passed .lenouncing the candidacy of Dr.
Washington Dodge for Assessor and
Edmund Godchaux for Recorder, and
pledging support to Albert Heyer for As
sessor and W. Z. Tiffany for Recorder.
The reasons given for the antipathy to
Dodge are that while energetic In his ef
fort" to collect polltax from the laboring
man he has been as equally active in
overlooking the collection of the fame
from his friends; that he has employed
in the Assessor's office non-voters and
Godchau* is charged with being a too
recent addition to the ranks of Democracy
to be supported for office while .he well
known old time Democrats are overlooked.
Hence the indorsement of their political
opponents. ,

When crossing Fillmore street a bicycle
