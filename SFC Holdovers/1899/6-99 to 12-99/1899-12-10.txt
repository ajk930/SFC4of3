EXPLOSION OF FIREDAMP
ENTOMBS EIGHTY MINERS
Death's Awful Harvest in a Colliery at Car
bonado, Wash.
Two Scores of Workmen Instantly Killed by the Shock or Cut Off
From Escape and Suffocated by
Deadly Gases.
C! WaÂ«h., Dee. 9.â ThO
rr.oct r.ppanirg mlamity In the
l.'slory nf roal mining In this Ft:Â«te
occurred at 11:30 o'clock this morn
ing, v.hen an cxplorlcn In f-haft
Ko. T of the Carbon mil coal mines ooÂ«t
the lives of hrtweÂ«:j forty and fifty min
'rs. The cause of the disaster Is ap jet
ur.kv.own. but It Is rrj orted that miners
working bctv.een the 200 and CM foot lev
els broke Into old mine working*, which
wrre filled with gas. The explosion fol
lowed as so.-i!i as this outpouring r^s
came into contact with the first miner's
lamp. The concussion was sufficient to
V>l<-*t oi:t the life cf every miner in the
bottom of mine No. 7.
Th" men killed are amnnc the best class
f'f minors employed in this State. The
<~*rbon Hill mines have never had any
libor troubles nnd the men are well paid,
making work thÂ«re more desirable than
!n moi-t coal min<Â»s. Most Of the men
wÂ«*re married and lived with their fami
lies in -â¢ .c cottages at <"arhonadrÂ».
whJeh stand* on a hill a few hundred feet
above the entrance to the mine rtdngv.
It was almost r.oon when a dull report
or concussion was heard at Carbonado
and in other shafts of the mines. Some
thought a larger blast than usual had
\>rrn fired, but an Instant later a great
blue volume of smoke bepan pouring from
the mine tunnel and air shaft. It was in
stantly realized that a terrible catastro
phe had occurred. The news quickly
rpr^ad and very soon weeping women and
children were thronging the streets, be
wailing the certain deaths of fathers or
brothers.
Work was immediately suspended In the
ether shafts at.d Superintendent Davles
ordered all xnrn available to commence
resrtjp work, which has been In progress
r-ver since. At midnight eighteen bodies
find eleven injured men have been brought
Â«.ut. The ..-*... i Â»â¦-Â»â â¦- taken to the morgue.
\>ut OUBcalty has been experienced in en
gating men to wash and UrVss them. The
miner* here are chiefly Welshmen and
Fins, the latter of whom are somewhat
*u;vrstltinus nnd seem to dr< ad the hand
ling of the bodies of their comrade* of a
f*.w hours prÂ«'Vious.
Fix men are in the hospital and the oth
er Injured have been taken to their homes.
Men are now working to get the tram
cars In operation on the water level of
t'je mine that the rock, timbers and coal
may be removed from the places where
rirad mlivrs lie entombod. it will require
nil night to accomplish this, making it im
probable that Â«ny more bodies will be re
covered to-night.
The dead men at th* Morgue are burned
end charred almost beyond recognition.

leaving ghastly-looking arms and legs
protruding. Sights like these have made
strong men weep and almost unnerved
the heroic rescuers.
The mine li not yet cleared of fire
damp. The rescuing parties go into the
tunnel as far a.Â« they dare and often
come out entirely overcome by firedamp.
They are laid out In rows at the tunnel
entrance. As fast as they recover they
again enter the mine to rescue the
dead. These parties are relieved by new
sets of men every two or three hour*.
All of these men are volunteers. The
work is being directed by Superintendent
Da Me?.
The superintendent declares his inabil
ity to account for the accident. The
mine has been inspected every few hour-;
for years, in strict conformity with the
State mining laws.
He does not believe in the first theory,
that the miners broke into the old mine
workings and encountered a large cham
ber of gas He Inclines to the belief that
some careless miner disobeyed the rules
and lighted a match or unscrewed his
lamp, thereby Igniting some small gas
body. This in turn set fire to others, and
In an instant the explosion bad been
caused.
Sunday will be the saddest day Carbon
ado has ever experienced. By to-morrow
afternoon most of the bodies will nave
been taken out and turned over to their
sorrowing families. The inquest will be
started on Monday and is likely to last
several days. a car ad of coffins will
arrive on Monday morning. Most of the
funerals Will occur on Monday and Tues
day.
The only mine officer killed in the explo
sion was Fire Inspector Ilees- Jones, aged
30. ii. started to work every day at 2
a. m., Quitting at 11:30 a. in.
His day's work was finished and he was

A few years ago her daughter and Brand

Richard Dare was ore of the finest
young â  Welshmen living here. .He was
married only a year ago. and his aged
father. and. mother, had just arrived here
to visit him and his wife.
When the rescuers came upon the dead
men at the further end of the tunnel it
became necessary to carry them out at

The bodies were accordingly quickly

BOHR HEAD LAAGER, Ladysmith, Friday, Dec. 8.-
The British troops made a sortie between 1 and 2
o'clock this morning. They crawled up a ravine and
stormed and carried Lombards Kop, which was held
by the Boers, and on which were placed a Creusot gun
and a howitzer. These guns were destroyed with
dynamite. The British captured a Maxim gun and
then retired. The Lancers, Hussars and Guards
made a sortie west of Ladysmith at daybreak under
cover o? a heavy artillery fire, which the Boers re
turned briskly. The British afterward returned to
Ladysmith. The Boer losses are reported to have
been slight.

It is known that the Boers have crosscut the ends
of their Mauser bullets, thus producing an effect
similar to the dum-dums. Halse and Warren and
thirty men left the camp at Carnevon to-day and when
four miles out sighted a patrol of twelve Boers,
who sought cover. Two of the Boers were wounded.
Halse ascertained that the Boers were in strong
force in a laager and retired to his base. This is the
first brush of General Gatacre's forces, and they are
all eager to follow it up.

LONDON, Dec. 9.â What with the growing Inclination to be skeptlr.il nver
glorious victories that leave the Boers able to fight just as hard trie next
day. with the still virulent storm of disapproval raining in from .til
quarters on Joseph Chamberlain because of his rtmarkahle alliance
speech, and with the dawning realization of the difficulties which b<*sÂ«t
the task of conquering the Boers and wiping away Afrikander dissatisfaction,
tho position of the British Government at home has been by no .means
strengthened. A really decisive victory, compelling the Boers to vacate thÂ«
scene of British operations, or enabling the British to achieve the relief Â»t
Klnberley or Ladysmlth. would quickly Improve, the feeling. Th.it all Is not

It appears that the British forward movement â¢li retarded m >re by the ;h>

Military critics during the past wetfK nave frequently observed that If It Is nec

British territory it would be much more essential to do m when the head column*

those who accompanied the bodies for
news of their loved ones. In a rough
building belonging to the Miners' Asso

washed and Identilled. Acting upon the
suggestion of the Coroner, the shreds of
clothing torn by the force of the explo

There are undoubtedly a number of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. DECEMBER 10, 1899.
MILLER SAYS EXTRA
SESSION IS ASSURED
Claims Sixty=Seven Signatures to
the Caucus Agreement and Says
Burns Is Losing Strength.
SACRAMENTO. Dec 9.âAssembly
man H. W. Miller of Sun Fran
cisco has been la Sacramento In the
Interest of an extra session and toe
election of Dan Burns as United
States â tor. The Assemblyman did
not talk much on the outside, but he said
enough to make it known that' the par
pose of his visit was primarily in the In
terest of Colonel Burns. The Call corre
spondent is Informed that Miller carried
away the signature only of Assemblyman
Grove LI Johnson to the agreement ot a.
caucus and that he failed to secure the.
names of Senator Doty and Assemblyman
\V. D. Knights and Morris, Brooke. In
deed, it is said that Doty, whose opposi
tion to Burns is well known, was not BVen
approached by the San Francisco As
semblyman en the subject of the extra
session. Miller, it Is understood heie,
claims to nave secured fifty-three or liny
four signatures, although sixty-one are
needed. He gave it out, so The Call corre
spondent is informed, that while the Gov
ernor's call would contain references to
the San Francisco harbor situation and
the necessity for legislation along the
lines of the Vrooman act, the real pur
pose of the call would be the election of
a United States Senator. An important
paper Which Miller asks his fellow-mem
ben of the Legislature to sign. In addi
tion to the request for a call, is an agree
ment to adjourn at the request of Gov
ernor Gage.
It is said that some of those who re
fused to sign this clause did so because
they believed the Governor would exer
cise â¢:..â¢ privilege thus accorded him as
soon as Burns was elected and that no
other business would result from the tcs
â ion. Borne of those who declined to siyn
the agreement said they were not willing
to let Governor Gage dictate to them when
th. proper hour should come for them to
dissolve, as they considered the legisia
lors themselves were competent to deter
mine that. Miller gave assurances
while here that in the event of an extra
session the Burns men would be able to
count upon the support of Assemblyman
Crowley and Senators Feaney and Hall cf
San Francisco, who belonged to the min
ority in the last session of the .Legisla
ture.
Assemblyman W. D. Knights of this
city to The Call correspond* to-night,
in speaking of the conversation he nad
with Assemblyman Miller, said:
"Assemblyman Miller was here on Fri
day." said Mr. Knights, "and he told me
that lie had sixty-two or sixty-three sig
natures to a caucus agreement. He want
ed me to sign the agreement, but 1 re
fused to do so and I told him that if there
was an extra session of the Legislature I
saw no other show for those opposed to
Burns but to go into caucus and fight It
out there Though 1 refused to sign the
caucus agreement, yet 1 feel that there
should be a meeting of the Legislature
for the purpose of electing a Senator. If
Burns can obtain votes enough in the
caucus to Insure his election those op
posed to him should join the caucus. I
am as much opposed to Burns now as
ever, though I still believe that a Senator
should be elected, but of course if those
opposed to him do not concentrate his
election is likely. I do not think that the
Governor would call an extra session un
1. .-- there was a caucus that would in
sure the election of a Senator. I will be
ready to announce my choice whenever
the Legislature convenes, but 1 will not
sign a caucus agreement until it bears
the names of at least seventy-five mem
bers of the Legislature â enough to insure
the election of a Senatorâ at the time It
is presented to me for my signature. 1
will not sign an agreement if it bears but
sixty-one, sixty-two or sixty-three signa
tures."
Mr. Knights concluded by saying that
curd ran give the sliphtest p.,-s<ible ex
planation only safety lampsâ the Enj?

that this v â  although a mule

did not lake much urging, for the black

â  early as T can remember."

There *ir e several air shafts or chutes

outlets for the damp and at the same time
furnished ventilation as the damp was
driven out.

All this evening the rain has been driz

mud.
In this rain and through this mud the
silent procession?, hearing upon stretchers
the corpses and the injured, have been
alOWly treading their way to th.> Morpuo
and the hospital, handling with tender so
licitude their grewsome burdens.
The last estimate Buptriutcudent Da
under, no circumstances will he vote for
Burns in caucus.
Assemblyman H. W. Miller of the For
tieth District said yesterday upon his re
turn from Sacramento that If all Gover
nor Gage required to call an extra ses
sion was the signatures of sixty-one or
more of the legislator! attached to an
agreement to caucus on the Senatorial
proposition and abide by the decision of
the caucus he would be pleased to de
liver th.. goods at any time the executive
might name.
Instead of the sixty-one names demand- i
ed by the Governor Miller claims to have
sixty-seven and further says that he has i
verbal agreements from all of the rest of
the majority, save three or four whom he
has not seen. Concerning the general
Senatorial situation Mr. Miller said last
evening: "In the past two months i have
met nearly every member of the Legisla
ture, and despite contrary statements, I
can see only two candidates for the Sen
atorshlp; they are Colonel Burns and Irv
ing M. Scott. 1 personally am in favor of
M. 11. de Youne and I called to see him
yesterday. He was out, but 1 saw Mr.
Deane, his secretary, and he informed me
that he did not think Mr. de Young would
be a candid not, at any rate, unless he
could get a block of twenty-five of Grant's
votes to go on the Boor with. This is in]
line with what Mr. de Young told me Just
before he went East; at that time he said
he had had all the empty honors he want
ed from the people of California and
would not be again a candidate unless he
was certain of election."
Speaking of the strength which Mr.
Burns will carry into caucus Mr. Miller '
said: "I cannot see where Coloned Burns
has or can increase the strength be had
at the last session, In fact his election
or defeat will be determined by the Brsi
j caucus ballot. Unless he polls thirty- :
seven or thirty-eight votes on the Oral call
he will lose four at least of the votes he
goes on the door with. There are a num
ber in his camp who are very sore, but
who are willing to give him the one
chance of the first ballot. If ho does not
stand then they will gulf his fight. Mr.
Burns told me two weeks ago that he :
. would not tie matters up by staying in
the light if he should see that he could
I not win. but would withdraw in favor of
some other one of the candidate?."
Mr. Miller also corroborated the state
ment that Milton J. Green had declined a
proposition from Colonel Burns to handle
his fight. â¢â¢! was talking with Mr. Green
to-day." said Mr. Miller upon that point,
"and he Informed me that if Irving M.
Scott entered the tight, as was probable
, he would get in on his side. He also told
me that Mr. Burns had made him a prop- I
osition to 'Tret in with him, but that he
bad turned it down."
i The caucus agreement which Mr. Miller
has been circulating has been signed in
each cast- with the understanding that an
nouncement should l" by the Speaker of
the Assembly and President of the Ben
ate at least twenty-four hours before the
caucus hour, in order thai there might be
plenty of time for the rallying of forces.
That the session will come off there is
I now little doubt among the many who are
directly interested. Assemblyman Henry
C. Dibble, who at the last session was
very close to both Colonel Burns and Gov
ernor Gage, a few days ago displayed .i
copy of the call which he said the Gov
ernor would make, but it was noticed at
the time that Dibble' 9 copy said nothing
of the settlement of Senatorial matters
Shortly after Governor <i;, , : is known to
have said that be would not issue a call
unless it Included some such can-.- and
a second copy, which Dibble has sine*.
been exhibiting to his confidants, contains
the necessary paragraph. ''â¢'

ROBERTS DENOUNCES
ONE OF HIS ACCUSERS
Sensational Incident of the Hear
ing Before the Special Com
mittee of the House.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.â The House
special committee having in charge the
oase of Congressman-elect Roberts of
I'tah. who has been denied a seat in the
House on the charge that he is a polyga
mist. spent the entire day listening to
Robert.-' presentation of his defense, and
to the statements of his accusers. The
sensation of the day came in the after
noon, when Roberts bitterly denounced A.
T. Schroeder. one of the Gentile delega
tion fn,m Utah, as a â windier and a man
unworthy of confidence.
The consideration of the Roberts case
was resumed at 10 o'clock. Roberts being
pr- sent to plead to certain specific Inter
rogatories which had been framed. The
proceedings continued to be behind closed
doors. Roberts was lirst asked if he con
ed, d the existence of the court record,
wherein he pleaded guilty in isv> under
the Edmunds-Tucker law. This he con
ceded. He was next asked whether,
about 1887, he had married plural wives
and had lived with them Since that time
as wives. To the whole of this charge
Roberts pleaded not guilty, and then
demurred to the jurisdiction of the
committee for the following reasons:
Firstâ On the ground '>f violation >â ( <-onHti
tnttonal rUhts In that It attÂ»-m;.te.l to try him
f<-t ;i crime without presentment of in.!,
by Brand jury and without trlul before a jury
and .in- pi'" . m >if law.
:it it was an attempt to deprive
him o: vested property that be h<-M in the
emoluments of an office for the full term.
Thlr.lâ That the only evidence that could be
rightfully considered in the committee was a
court record and the establishing of the Kullt.
confessed or proved, of the Uepreaentatlve
elect and that the committee ha* no right to
consider any other evidence.
Fourthâ That the crime alleged, namely, that
of unlawful cohabitationâ even if provedâ
would not constitute a safflclent crime to bar
a member or deprive him of ins neat, because
Innocence of polygamy or unlawful cohabita
tion Is nowhere enumerated in the Constitution
as a qualification of the office of, member of
Congress, nor Is It named In any ITnlted States
law applicable to Utah or any other State.
Roberts argued these points for nearly
two hours, referring to law books and
answering queries. It ws con
troversy throughout, the facts not being
gone Into at length. Roberts concluded
-king that his prlma fade right to
a seat b> at once considered, as the pres
ent status denied to â  sovereign Stat. rep
resentation in the House at a time when
Injurious legislation affecting that State
might t.ik" place.
The first of the public hearings in the
Roberts case began at I o'clock. At that
hour the committee room was crowded
with members, representatives of the
press and delegates representing th
tile element of I'tah. Rot* rts -at at the
end cf a long table, with documents piled
up before him. Tils secretary was near
at hand, bringing him books and other
data of reference, chairman Tayler an
nounced that persons who had partici
pated in framing the charges were pres
ent and he asked that they be heard. A.
T. Bchroeder, 'me of the Gentile delega
tion from rtah. then stepped forward
and was about to proceed when Roberts
hastily and raised his hand in pro
test.
"I object." he said. "1 object to this
witn-ss if hi- comes her-- hs an attorney,
i object to him if he comes as a wit
ness, on lh< ground that he Ih unworthy
of confidence, and because he is â  com
mon swindler. And I propose to â 
i!sh by the records of the Supreme Conn
Of Utah that he is utterly unworthy of
Roberts said he would present the
tenth rtah Supreme Court report In sup
port of his ail. nations. Tayler answered
that Schroeder was not present as a wit
neaa or as counsel, but merely to give
the committee such information as he

SANTA BARBARA. Dec. 9.â \'da Addis
Storke may be a free woman again to
morrow morning. She said to-night that
she would secure ball to-morrow and ma
t liberty pending the appeal of her case
to the Supreme Court. The charge
against her of attempting to murder At
torney Grant Jackson in July last was to
day dismissed on motion of District Attor
ney Bquler on the grounds that the evi
dence against the defendant was insuffi
cient to show intent on her part to take
the life of Jackson as there was only one
witness to the affair, and that one the
prosecuting witness. Her east was also
submitted to the Grand Jury last week
and it failed to put an indictment against
her. but recommended that the matter be
dismissed.
While the prevailing opinion is that the
woman Is guilty as cnarged. yet the tre
mendous expense that li would necessi
tate and the. fact that there was but one
witness, did not In the mind of the Dis
trict Attorney, warrant the chance of a
conviction. It Is here claimed that the de
fendant has been confined in the County
Jail In default of $.V"j ball required of her
on the attempt to murder charge, and
that this time served does not go on the
! sentence on the conviction In the libelous
letter case. It is also claimed that she
will bo compelled to serve one year's time,
commencing at the. time of the dismissal
of the late charge. Vila Addis was 1 much
surprised that her case was dismissed.
Mrs. StorkÂ« is accused <â¢! entering At
torney Grant Jackson's room early one
morning and when awoke she was pr<-
paring to administer chloroform and held
a pistol. Near her were two knives, ropes.
a bottle of cyanide of potassium and two
loaded pistols. Her defense was that she
was there as wife, claiming that they
had entered Into a contract marriage and
she had taken nil name. ?*. .

yard to fix the scale of wages for em
ployes for the next mx months has rec
ommended to the Navy Department a
general Increase of 5 per cent In ail de

metal workers. Mr. Metcalf said that
while the department would probably de
prive the striking shipwrights of employ
ment for some time, they will ultimately
return to work.
â¢ He says that Mr. Allen. Assistant Sec
1 retary of the Navy expressed himself
very strongly regarding the action of
the men In leaving the Hartford in her
unfinished condition and thought they
should be censured In some way.
Mr. Metcalf Is making a comparison, of
wages received by the employes of the
Mare Island navy yard and Eastern

A number Â«jf newspapers were piled In.
the street cloSe to the edge of the side
walk and a lighted match was applied to
the heap.
The children had formed a circle around
the. blaze and were dancing around In glee
when little Mildred, getting too close to
the burning pile, set tire to her clothes.
In a moment the child was enwrapped in
HllWi and the other children were help

Mrs. Weyler and Mrs. Welburn, who
live close to where the accident occurred,
saw the child running, screaming, from
her companions to her house, and, rushing
Into the street, took a coat from the back
of one of Mildred's playmates, wrapped It
around the burning body of the suffering
child and carried her to her home. Dr.
Mahoney was at once summoned, and
upon examination pronounced the burns
fatal. The child's face and neck and
lower limbs were burned in a terrible

for six hours in fearful agony breathed
her last.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Doc. 9.â
Senator Perkins and Representatives Bar
ham, DeVrles, Metcalf, Kahn, Waters and
Needham, accompanied by Captain Dan
iels of Riverside, waited upon the Presi
dent this morning to consult with him
about the citrus fruits of California, and
the possible effect of the proposed recip
rocity treaty with Jamaica now pending
for ratification before the Senate, upon
such industry. Senator Perkins presented
Captain Daniels, and in a very able way
he presented the difficulties with whicn
citrus fruit growers of California had
heretofore contended, and demonstrated
that the present tariff had enabled grow
ers to meet foreign competition and enter
the markets of thÂ« United States
He feared this treaty might be the enter
ing wedge to future treaties of a similar
nature with other countries, which might
: endanger th* industry in California.
The President replied that he did not
want to do anything which would Injure
any Industry In the great State of Cali
fornia, and that he desired that no treaty
affecting her interests should be consid
ered without full hearing being first ac
corded to the Californlan delegation and
to the people of California; and especially
enjoined upon Senator Perkins and the
I delegation to request Commissioner Kas
son. who Is In charge of such treaties, to
accord a hearing before such action.
Later the delegation waited upon Com
missioner wesson and delivered the Presi
! dent a message. They were assured by
him that no reciprocity treaty affecting
the Industries of California would be ne
gotiated without ilrst giving a full hear
ing to the delegation and to the people of
[ that State. The delegation came away
feeling that the rights and Interests of
California will be fully protected by the
present administration. Senator Perkins
has been assured by the Senate Commit
tee on Foreign Relations that the terms
or the treaty will be made public on Mon
day and that ample time will be given the
California delegation and representatives
of the various associations of California

National Committee recommending that
hereafter all candidates, according to the
principles of the party, hÂ»- chosen by the

TAYLOR'S
CERTIFICATE
IS ISSUED
Officially Declared Governor-
Elect of the State of
Kentucky.
FEW PEOPLE PRESENT
Court Deoides That the Ballots
Printed on Tissue Paper Are
Contrary to Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Dec. 9â At 9:t5
this morning the election certificate of
William 8. Taylor was signed by the
dec t lon Commissioners and he was de
clared to be Governor-elect of Kentucky.
The official figures of the vote filed with
the Secretary of State are as follows:
Taylor. 1M.714; Goebel, 191.331. Taylor's
plurality, 13&3.
The operation, which ended, for the.
time being at least, the bitterly fought
gubernatorial contest, was conducted in
the simplest manner. The majority
opinion of Commissioners I'ryor and Ellis
and the minority opinion of Commissioner
Poyntz were not read, as was the origi
nal intention. The three Commissioners
walked first to the office of the Clerk of
the State Supreme Court, where they filed
the two opinions. They then passed into
the office of the Secretary of State.
Clerk Chenault of the Hoard of Commis
sioners read the figures, showing that the
Republican candidates for office on the
State ticket had received the largest num
ber of votes, and then the certificates of
â¦â¢lection were signed at once, that of Mr.
Taylor being lirst on the list.
There were only fourteen people In the
room at the time, and of this number
only two were there a^ spectators.
T_here was no crowd around the build
ing, and no interest was manifested in
the work save by thÂ«.se engaged in it and
those who stood looking on. The threo
Commissioners were all apparently in
g I humor, although Commissioners El
lis and i'rvnr. who had dOM the most
work in preparing the long and elaborate
report, 'â  Joked won and tired.
The certificates, as soon as signed, were
filed with the Secretary of State, and
commissions will be Issued to the elected
men by Governor Bradley.
At to-day's session of the Court of Ap
peals the tissue ballot case from Ohio
Count;, was decided and the decision was
concurred in by tour of the seven
Judges.
The court held that ail ballots should
be printed on white paper, sufficiently
thick thai the'printlng cannot be dlsttn
; guished from the back, and if ballots arÂ«>
! used at an election which do not sub
, stantlally comply with the law the eiec
j tion is not conducted as required by law
I and Is invalid.
The opinion of the court comes too late
I to aff.-ct the decision or the State Elec
1 tlon Commission, but sets a precedent for
the State Contest Hoard.
The Court of Appeals to-day announced
i another decision which has an important
1 bearing upon the late State ele< tion in
Kentucky. The decision was a ruling
making perpetual the wilt of prohibition
Issued against Judge Tony of LOUlSVllle,
restraining Mm from interfering with
local elections bj writs of mandamus. He
was charged by the Democrats with ar
bitrarily issuing writs.

How "77" breaks up
COLDS
How?
It is interesting to know just how
"77" cures a Cold by restoring the
checked circulation (kiiown by a sud-
den chill), the first sign of taking Cold;
starts the blood coursing through the
veins and so "breaks up" the Cold.
Remember that Colds include La
Qrtppe, Influenza. Catarrh. Coughs,
Bon Throat. Diphtheria, Bronchitis and
Pneumonia.
A handy bottle of "77" carried in the
pocket for immediate use prevents, '
"breaks up" and cures every kind of a '
Cold.

a lot of seed wheat owned by him to

stowed away in a mattress. It Is claimed

that it was through line's wife that

the Board of State Prison
Directors.
Fperial r>lÂ«patrh to The Call.
SAN QUEN'TIN PRISON. Doc. 9.âCon
vict D. c Probasco is a marked man. He
has been placed under the ban by the
other prisoners and if he remains at San
Quentin the time la sure to come when
he will meet death at their hands. it may
be a knife-thrust, a blow on. the head
from a bludgeon or the dread cord of the
Karroter; but a violent death in some turn
is as sure as fate.
When the Board of State Prison Direct
ors met to-day In regular monthly ses
sion a novel scene was witnessed. War
den Agulrre arose at the besinnlns of the
meeting and said he had a matter of grave
Importance to draw to its attention, Pro
oasco was the burden of hit remarks.
T he warden informed the board that this
prisoner was the one who had informed
Guard Samuel Yoho that Convict Jacob
Oppenheimer was stabbing Guard James
McDonald in the Jute mill on March 16
last and thereby saved McDonald's life,
lor this the more vicious element in the
prison had decret-d that he should die-,
and already two attempts bad been made
on his life. Though they were made in
vain, no clew had been discovered to the
would-be murderers in either case. Aguir
re believed that Probasco was deserving
of executive clemency on account of Ins
act at the time of the stabbing and asked
that he be recommended for pardon.
Guard McDonald sent the board a letter
In which he asserted that he believed lie
owed his life to Probasco and that if it
had not been for him Yoho would not have
reached the spot in time. McDonald
asked the board to recommend executive
clemency.
Guard Voho told the directors that he
was walking away from the scene of the
attempted murder when Probasco rushed
up and told him what was going on; otn
erwlse he could not have saved McDon
ald life. Yoho favored a pardon.
After due consideration of the circum
stances the board adopted a motion by
which It was decided to ask the Governor
to pardon Probasco. The convict is serv
ing a 21-year term from Btsklyou for
murder in the second degree and In the
ordinary course of events he would not bo
released until November 1, IÂ»J6
President Fitzgerald was absent from
the meeting to-day, but It was the regu
lar time for the election of a new cScrk
or the board for the succeeding four years
and the Directors concluded not to tarry
in the matter. Director Devlin was placed

Clayton C. Bump, who wan paroled two
years ago. addressed the hoard and asked
for a pardon. He said he could.get a good

It on account of the parole law permitting
nobody to leave the State. Hump was Im

He will dwell particularly on Samoa and
the Transvaal and will frankly acknowl

between Germany, the United States and
Great Britain. He will also show the ab

SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST DR. WINN
A Citizen of Tomnles Accuses Him of
Being Responsible for the
Death of a Child.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 9.â Dr. A. C. Winn
of Tomales. the physician who came Into
prominence two weeks ago by his connec
tion with bribery charges In the Gritlln
will contest, was accused to-day by Mar
tin Zoppi of Marshallg with having caused
the death of his four-year-old boy. The
facts in the case, a* alleged by Zoppl,
were laid before Coroner Eden, who will
proceed to Itarshalla to-morrow In com
pany with District Attorney Mclsaac and
make an Investigation of the charges.
Zoppi informed Coroner Eden that a
few days ago be sent for Dr. Wlnn to at
tend the boy. and that the physician im
mediately pronounced him a sufferer from
pneumonia. Wlnn began treatment, but
was 'bo careless in making his professional
calls, so the father claims, and so negli
gent in prescribing that the child died to
3 ay.
Wlnn bears the reputation of being a
"hard drinker." and on that account got
Into trouble with Judge Angellotti during
the progress of the Gritlln will contest.
lit- was subpenaed to give evidence for
the plaintiff and failed to appear. Judge
Angellottl Issued a bench warrant of ar
, rest, which was served on Wlnn at Tlbu
ron by Officer Cottlngham. At that time
Wlnn was intoxicated and so appeared
before the court. He was told to be pres
ent on the. following day. and gave his
promise, but next day became Intoxicated
again and once more failed to appear in
court. Attorney Keys finally decided to
let the evidence pass and Judge Angellotti
was lenient and permitted Wlnn to escape
punishment.
Shortly after this Attorney Hugh Jones
charged Winn with having tried to secure
$100 from the defendant to give favorable
evidence, and Attorney Keys shot bach
the allegation that Wlnn had told him
and others It was Attorney Cochrane who
tried to do the bribing. Nothing came of
the charges.
Attorney â¢ Cochrane. however, fired a
parting salvo at Dr. Winn In the shape
of a charge that in. addition to being a
drunkard he was a "morphine fiend."

CHEAPER GOODS
FOR THE MASSES
Wanamaker on De-
partment Stores.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.â John Wana
maker to-day testified before the Indus
trial Commission on the subject of depart
ment stores. He' claimed these stores
were beneficial to society, having a sub
stantial and moral basis for their exist
ence.
â¢It Is," he says, "tne natural product
of the conditions existing and from a
fixed trade law. Cheaper capital, better
transportation, more rapid communica
tion make the modern retail store possi
ble, natural and useful, therefore inevita
ble. Economy in the expenditure of
money, time and effort measures the de
partment store's success. Just In propor
tion as these ends are reached Is it popu
lar, powerful and prosperous."
He contended that the effect of the cre
ation of these stores had been to reduce
retail prices. in support of this statement
ho asserted that upon American dry goods
generally the retailer's percentage of pro
fits has been reduced one-half during the
last twenty years. This was true also of
woolen, silk and cotton fabrics. The total
per cent of reduction in prices to the con-
Burner could not be stated, owing to the
varying standards of qualities and taste
and Improvements In manufacture, but
Mr. Wanamaker believed that the con
sumer saved the entire reduction in the
retailer's profit. In some articles definite
comparisons of prices were made.
It could also be stated, he said, that the
profits of the great retail stores vary from
3 to 6 per cent on the dollar of the busi
ness done.

LOCAL CONSOLIDATION
1""" HE.. Associated Improvement Clubs of Oakland
\l3\r renewed the campaign lor consolidation
* of OaAdand, Berkeley and Alameda, with certain
intervening villages, into one city and county or
ganizalion.
The residents and taxpayers of these divided mu
nictpalitirs find that under .-. duality of government
they are paying a higher tax rate for their civic es
tsblisJtmcut than is paid in San Francisco. For in
stance, the jvcraq;e rate in Oakland for ten years past
has been $i 63, and in San Francisco $1 i.?. It this
calculation be extended it will be found that that dif
ference of 50 cents on the $100 of property valuation
m.ikrs a portentous sum. At an average taxable
valuation of $30,000,000 it is $150,000 a year, and the
waste in the ten years covered by the statement would
be a million and a half of dollars! That sum, if in
hand now, would a'nc to Oakland, at once, the finest
park system in California outside of San Francisco.
In considering consolidation, however, there are
many prejudices to be met. Even small communities
feel a pride in their local designation and dislike to
change it by being rechristencd in the name of
another town against which they have naturally felt
a * pirit of rivalry. This long stood in the way of the
consolidation of Greater New York, and was finally
found to be so insurmountable that all the municipal
panic* thereto were permitted to retain their local
name by being designated a* "boroughs." It will be
found worth while for the consolidationists of Oak
land to examine the constitution and laws of Cali
fornia far authority to do the same with the towns
en thnt side of the bay. The city and county of Oak
land could then include the boroughs of Oakland,
Berkeley, AJamrda. etc., and local pride and prejudice
would be foothed. If no such authority exist now it
would be well to prepare for consolidation by pro
posing an amendment to the constitution which will
permit fucli borough organization.

ABOUT NATIONAL BANKS.
IT is a pleasure to reasonably discuss great issues
affecting the fireside interests of the people.
Perhaps there is no subject more mi -understood,
connected with finance and economics, than the rela
fiii of l>ank> to business and to the people. This
misunderstanding especially affects national banks,
wr|lich are regarded by many as the especial beneii-
Federal favor.
The Willows Promoter, an excellent newspaper of
influence in the Sacramento Valley, in commenting
upon The Call's exposition of the financial reform
'ion now before Congress says:
Bj .\hum are the measures 'desirable' outside of
Wall street and the United States bondholders?
"For the benefit of such of our readers a* may not
know we will state briefly the provisions of the na
tional banking law as it will be after the proposed
.: Any five persons holding an aggregate of
$25,000 worth of United States bonds may incorporate
a national bank. By depositing their bond- with the
Comptroller <>f Currency the United States
$25,000 in bank imti - to the bankers. This is a free
v the Government to the bondholders, wh
â¢ â  pen have to pay for printing the paper money.
This money they can loan at interest, buy real e<t:itf
or in\o-t. ;i S they pleasr. i.t it i- absolutely their own.
Th;> they draw interest on their bonds, and then
, draw another interest on the paper money issued in
; lien of them
"The legislation 'agreed upon' will make a free gift
ait $100,000,000 to Wall street loathe $1,000,000,
000 of Government bund- will get "up to par of tin
bonds' instead of bat 5j00.000.000. a- they do now.
"\\ hy not donate something to >trui<nl' n X business
men direct' Why should the Government pile tip
tash in the money-lender's hands that he may impose
a burden on the producer in the form of interest?
pen if the Promoter stands alone it a ill rane
its voice on the c ide of the people and denounce the
outrageous scheme "agreed upon." "
Hoping thai thi^ means an open mind on the p-irt
of the Promoter, and a desire to spread information.
we invite its attention to the Mtbiect of organizing
a bank with $_'5.000 in bonds deposited as security for
it< circulation.
: The stockholders of such a bank must first buy and
[ deposit with the treasury $25,000 in registered bonds
jof the United States. Under the proposed law they
' will receive $25,000 in national bank bills, which con
stitute the loan fund upon which the bank goes into
. business. The registered bonds of the United States
j by to-day's quotations bear an average premium of
14 per cent. Therefore the stockholders must pay
$28,500 for these $25,000 in bonds. The average in
terest on registered bonds is tf/ 2 per cent. The same
law puts an annual tax of one-tenth of one per cent
j on the capital of the bank and an internal revenue
tax annually of $50. There is also an internal revenue
tax on all drafts and bills of exchange issued by th*.
1 bank, the sum of which depends, of course, upon the
' volume of that line of business transacted. In addi
tion to this the Federal law permits the State taxation
, of the capital of national banks at the same rate is
other moneys and solvent credits. Let us say that in
this State such local taxation averages $2 in the $100.
i which is probably a trifle below the real average. We
! may now estimate the returns to a bank of $25,000
capital in registered bonds. "Any five persons hold
ing an aggregate of $25,000 worth of United States
bonds may incorporate a national bank," and their
account will stand this way:
. Bonds, par value $23,000
Premium 3,500
Total Investment 528.500
They receive $25,000 in bills, the par value of their
bonds, and proceed to loan it. The profit account
' and expense will stand:
Annunl interest on bills $2,500
Annual Interest on bonds 875
â¢ Annual income $3,375
Tax one-tenth of 1 per cent J25.37
Tax on internal revenue M.OO Â
Local tax 100.00
na
-y_
Net pr0fit............... $2,797
This 1- the total net profit flowing from the Federal
law to the 'lac persons" for their investment of
10 in registered bonds, or nine and eight-tenths
per cent
Bat, in addition to that, such bank muM have an
office, a president and a cashier, and the rent of â¦he
office and the salarie* of the officers must also come
out of the profit-. Patting rent at the low rate of
$300 per year leaves $J4Â«j7 out of which to pay the
talarie* <>i the officers, fuel, stationery and other in
cidental expenses of the bank. So the Promoter will
see that the five persons owning such a bank, which
the law says can be established in places of 2000 in
habitant*, will have to look elsewhere than to the Fed
eral "gift" for inducements to into banking. We
invite the attention of our critic to this statement and
' desire a frank reply whether there is anything in it to
I excite the cupidity of Wall street or to deserve tlu*
"denunciation" with which the Promoter threatens to
discuss it?
The object in orÃaiminK mch banks is to put sur
plus capital within ready reach of small rural com
munities. Around Willows, perhaps, there are many
; ranchers who, like all business men. have to rnakr
v.*r of their credit between seedtime and harvest or
between pruning and picking time in their orchards
and vineyards. If they are compelled to use thtl
credit at the country store the average coÂ«t to them
of such uÂ«e of it is put at 25 per cent. If they can
u=e it at a small bank at a cost of 10 per cent we fail
to s-e where and how they have been injured. The
Call has advocated this very change in the law. which
pives currency to banks to the par value of their
registered bonds and reduces the minimum capital to
Â«o. in the belief that it will benefit the farmer who
mint ns P his credit. If we are mistaken we will be
Klad to have our error pointed out.

SENATOR CHANDLER'S LATEST.
SENATOR CHANDLER of New Hampshire iÂ«
not known as a humorist. He is. however. Â«-,,
whimsical in his earnestness and has so' many
crank* to his convictions it is not easy to separate
him froiii the goodly hosts of those who in high
place* play antics for the amusement of the crowd.
His latest freak is one that has all the earmarks of a
merry jest, being a resolution providing that instruc
tion in higher mathematics and foreign languages
shall l>e eliminated from the curriculum at West
Point and Annapolis and in place thereof there shall
he provided courses in bicycling, football, baseball
and golf.
The Senator's bill bears the high-sounding title of
"An act to increase the efficiency of the West Point
Military Academy and the Annapolis Naval Academy
and to qualify and stimulate the American ymith for
actual military service by suitable physical training
THE SAJS fKAJNCISUO GALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 10. 1899.
instead of excessive mental education." It provides
for annual contests between the students at the two
academies to be held at Boston, New York, Philadel
phia, Pittsburgh Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, Rich
mond, Atlanta. New Orleans, Omaha and San Fran
cisco, at which suitable prizes shall be awarded. An
appropriation sufficient to pay the prizes is provided
for. but the railroads are required to carry free the
cadets to the places of contents and also the rep
resentatives of such reputable newspapers as the Sec
retaries of War and Navy may designate
A bill of that kind is certainly worth debating. Of
what avail is a knowledge of higher mathematics on
the part of our officers in the present war in the Phil
ippines? A set of clever sprinters would be more
effective against Aguinaldo than forty regiments of
mathematicians, and since it seems probable our fu
ture soldiers will have to fight in the Philippines for
generations to come, we might as we!! prepare then'
for it.
Moreover, the young men of thr army and the navy
have their uses in time of peace as well as in war.
and it 1- advisable to make such services more widely
popular and useful than they are. At present these
officers can hardly do anything more in times of
peace than lead cotillons. How much better would
it be to educate them to the sweet duties of the golf
field and the gentle sport of the gridiron ground than
to leave them accomplished only in the art of caper
ing in a ballroom to the lascivious pleasingS of a lute!
Another advantage of the proposed course of in
struction would be the relief it would give to the
universities, which arc now overstrained by the de
mand upon them for sluggers and scholars in equal
proportions. If the two great academies of the Gov
ernment undertake to supply the national need of
annual football rows the universities can devote their
energies to education and thus be enabled to furnish
the country with a scholarship equal to that which
emanates from the universities of Europe.
There is another merit of the bill which should not
be overlooked â one which ought to procure for it the
careful consideration of the countryâ that merit is to
be found in its superiority to other Chandler bills.
It will be much better for the Senate to discuss goU
as a part of military education than to listen to
Chandler talk of his peculiar views on finance and
trusts. If the Senator* bill be smothered in commit
tee he is certain to break loose somewhere else, and it
will certainly be wi-e on the part of Congress rather
to take the bill he has given them than to ri~k other-;
they know not of.
Oakland audiences arc being regaled this wcr':
with I scries of lectures intended to prove that a dead
man doesn't know he is dead. The lecturers might
profitably give a little time to an elTort to discover
why some living men don't know that they are alive.
FOR THE ChRISTMfIS SEASON
CHRISTMAS is at hand, and in accord with a
custom which hafi now become something like
an unwritten law the leading periodicals of tin-
Christian World will issue to their readers holiday
editions designed to be appropriate to the occasion
and to add to the general delight in the festival sea
son.
Jn harmony with that custom The Call will issue
next Sunday the most artistic Christmas number that
ever appeared from a California newspaper office.

gaudy patches of color. They will be veritable works
of art, presenting pictures by artists of high rank â
pictures that will repay prolonged study and merit
a conspicuous place among the artistic treasures of
the most cultured home*
The contents of the supplement will include articles
by Mark Twain. Ouida. Madge Morris Wagner and
other well-known writers. The Rev. Peter C. Yorke
will narrate the story of his year of travel in
Europe; Major Jose Ramon Pico, who has lived
in California under three tla^s, will describe the
Christmas festivities of the pastoral days before the
discovery of gold and the breaking up of the old.
happy life that was lived around the missions and on
the haciendas of the great land-owners. Ther.e will
be also pages of fashions, stories for children,
Christmas tale* for grown people, and something of
special interest to all classes of readers and to every
member of each family.
The illustrations which will accompany the articles
and adorn the pages will be of unusual excellence
even for The Call, whose "superiority in newspaper
art work i* now recogni7ed throughout the Union.
Taken as a whole The Â£hristmas Call will be the
most beautiful ever issued on the Pacific Coast and
not inferior to any in the Union. It will mark another
degree attained in the progress of The Call, and by
surpassing all that has been achieved in the past
will serve as a new point of departure for even
greater and more artistic triumphs to come.

DIVISION CAMP
FOR GUARDSMEN
IS DISCUSSED
Veterans of the Late
War Oppose It.
WANT MODIFICATION OF LAW
CAPTAIN WHO WANTS TO HAVE
THE RIGHT OF LINE.
Recent Changes in the Seventh Regi
ment â An Election for Captain
of Nnval Militia Will
Be Held.
The discussion In the National Guard
during the past week was division en
1 campment or no division encampment In
1900. now that the site at Santa Cruz liia
i been inspected by a military board and
approved. There are many who are of
, the opinion that a division encampment
' would be an excellent school for the sol
diers of the State and that it would sfl\e
them an opportunity to become acquaint
ed with the duties of camp life. Those
: who "have been to war" are opposed to
such an encampment for various reasons.
One Is that in seven days in camp ufll-
I cers and men, no matter how well they
, may be up in theory, would not learn ti.at
i which in actual service takes m .r.- than
seven wec^ks to l>Hrn, and. further, that
notwithstanding the division commander
might Issue an onlfr for the various or
ganizations of tht National ittiard
i semble for an encampment nt Santa <ruz.
I and threaten pains anÂ« penalties, lur lai 1
! ure to obey, not onaptialf of the n- n
; would respond, particularly thrÂ«-e ;n the
| sections i emote fr..in the camp site. Thty
argue that less than one-half of thr
Brigade would conM trotn tli> .-â¢mth for
the reason that the majority of those who
i belong to that brigade would have to kIM
the better part of two weeks --twelve
days at leastâ at their own expense, for
the glory of spending seven days playing j
â  soldier.
If it were a ca*<Â» of duty in behalf of
good order and peace or thÂ«- protection "f
I the State from Invasion, the men, onÂ»- md
â¢ all of them, would respond. The
j the soldiers say, applies to a Kreat por-
I tlon of the Third Brigade, so that then
would only be a fair representation, and '
; that from the Second Brigade, which is
1 within easy roach of the eanp The Item
;of expenses Is al*o talked of, for, to
bring the men from distant points would
cut a deep hole in the appropriation of '<
Â»3o.ixkj for camp purposes, as the railroads
WOUld not curry it.i troop* for much less
than regular rat.s and they could n.it be
brought uji ly steamer, a* th.-re is not a !
vessel that can accommodate a regim.'.a. â 
It Is suggested that if those In authority
Intend to help th.- guard an.l inak.
dlers of the mÂ«n. they will, r>r two fears
at leant, order regimental encampments, '
SO that the men <';m familiarise thf-m
selrea with the routine of regimental l'rv. J
They will then be In a position to he pro
detent t'*r a brigade encampment Expe
rience i n brigade formations and so furth !
will be beneficial; then It will be time to i
talk of a division encampment. There srtll i
be so many new m. n and new officers In
the gi'ard in iMO thai they would And
themnelvis sorely puzzled in the matter
of conducting a division encampment The
opponents of siu-h .i camn say: "Teach
the officers and the men to cr<
you make them walk."
I At the next session of the Legislature
I there will be an - rfort made to bring
about a modification â  " that
! tIOO of ih<- law that gives
manders of companies thÂ»- right i
for the dismissal of an anltetea ma:
the good <>f the service," without assign
ing any cause for the demand. This
power was Riven to commanders f.ir thfl
purpoM of reaching men who could no:
be reached bj OOUSt-martleJ nor bj .
thirds vote For Instance, â  man cm be
â  tried by court-martial for absenting hlm
sÂ»-lt from Three consecutive drills but he
cun not be reached if he attends one drill
| out of three. He might b.- dismissed by
; a two-thirds vote o* the company, but it
Is seldom that a rote of that character
can be obtained, for a man who can shirk
can always tlx It with a majority of the
company to prevent his being voted out.
Since that power has been given to cap
t.tliis It has Men abUSedL and nit p who
have dared to vote against a captain
when up for re-elf-etlon have been dis
missed ''for the jrood of the service." A
recent case In point was that of a young
man who belonged to one of the city or
ganizations. He had served six years and
nine months and would have had but
three months more to serve before obtain
ing his exemption certificate, when he
took sides against the captain ami voted
for the other fellow. This coming to the
knowledge of the captain he used his
power and had the young man dismissed
"for the good of the.servtce." causing him
to lose all the time he put Into the service
The captain cannot be required to give a
reason for his action and the young man
has no appeal. It Is proposed to isk the
legislature to amend the law so that
when a discharge is asked for on the
proiind of "the good of the service," the
commanding officer shall give his reasons
Company D of the First K.glment has
filed a supplemental muster roll with
twenty-three names, so that now the two
rolls that have been turned In make i
showing of fifty- five names. With It
plemental roll each company of the First
has more than the minimum, except one
which has an even fifty. As yet dM
regiment has not been "notified of the
acceptance of the rolls by superior head
quarters, because the commander In chief
Is In the southern part of the State and
the muster rolls have not yet been fully
examined and checked.
No notice for election will have any
effect until after the regiment has been
offlclaly recognized, notwithstanding me
fact that the captain of I'ompa:
knowing that his company was to report
back on the 3"Hh of November, gay. n. -
tlce of a call for an election on the 4th
of |ti>romb<T. Such notd-es are issued by
the brigadier general, and the time for
holding an election" must be fixed so far
ahead as to permit of the posting of the ;
notice for election In the armory for ten
days prior thereto. The move of the
captain of Company fJ was probably with
a. view *r> secure the senior captaincy of
the regiment and thus obtain the right
of line.
In the same regiment the following '
promotions are noted: Corporal W. K.
Btevens of Company D to be sergeant '
and Private I. Mendelovltz to be corporal !
In Company O; Sergeant Lewis K. Brown
to be first sergeant and Sergeant C, Â£\ .
Ford to be quartermaster sergeant' ( n
Company L; Corporal \V. B. Bowers to i
be sergeant; Corporal Hugh M. Day to
be sergeant: Privates Rmll F. Barton and
F. C. Roaster to be corporals.
T. H. Derby, who was first sergeant of
Company B of the. Fifth Infantry, and !
who was recently elected to first lieuten
ant of that company, was lirst sergeant
of Company B of the Eighth California
Volunteers, was advanced to sergeant
major, and before the end of his term .if
service was commissioned first lieuten
ant. He Is said to be one of the bright
est men In the regiment.
Orders have been termed for an election
of captain of the naval militia, vice, Can
taln Turner., whose term will shortly ex
pire. The captain has asked to he placed
on the retired list, consequently he v.-!ll
not be a candidate to succeed hims' If.
The election will be held on the Wth ln.st.
and Lieutenant Colonel Miles will

James, ex-dlvlslon commander of the Ni.
tional Guard, he having been placed for
that position several months ago.

TEACHERS MAY BE
AGENTS OF DEATH
Oakland's Health Board Praised
for Its Bold Reforms.
Physicians of Two Cities Give Reasons for
Isolating Consumptive Pupils as Well
as Instructors From Public Schools.
Shall teachers with tuberculosis be permitted to teach in the
public schools?
Shall children with tuberculosis be permitted to attend the
public schools?
These two questions have been propounded by the Oakland
Board of Health, and following so closely upon the proposition made
by Dr. D. D. Crowley of the State Board of Health to quarantine
consumptives are of unusual interest to every family in the State.
The proposition was advanced by Health Officer J. H. Todd, who
first suggested that teachers with the disease be disqualified by
law. The idea was then elaborated by Dr. Maher, who wanted
children with the disease included.
DR. J. MAHER OE OAKLAND'S HEALTH BOARD.
WHILE every medical man in this
city who has expressed an
opinion heartily sin with the
proposition of Health Officer
Todd. all are surprised that neb a seem
ingly rational and Imperative reform was
not inaugurated long ago. Of many phy
sicians who discussed the matter yester-.
day only one, Dr. J. M. Selfrldge of Oak
land, combats the movement, declaring
that consumption is neither contagious
nor Infectious, but hereditary. All others
agree that it is the duty of Boards of
Health and of Education and of parents
to pee that both teachers and pupils who
are suffering from phthisis or consump
tion should not come in contact with chil
dren otherwise healthy. Some have even
gone BO far as to suggest that consump
tive teachers and pupils should be placed
in schools by themselves. â Following are
some of the opinions of local physicians:
Dr. K. L.. Perrault, Supervisorâ l cannot
conceive of any duty more Incumbent on
a Board of Health or a Board of Educa
tion than to see that teachers should be
entirely free from thelgerms of consump
tion. The matter is one of vital impor
tance and interest to every parent, and
certainly no intelligent member of the
medical fraternity will differ from my
view.*. I think it is equally important that
the children also be examined, for con
sumptive children can do even more harm
I than teachers on account of their closer
contact with children who are healthy.
It Is impossible to estimate the amount of
danger that environs a careless victim of
tuberculosis. A teacher could not only
pollute a schoolroom but a whole school
if she should expectorate on the floor or
should be thoughtless in the use of her
handkerchief.
Or. H. H. Hartâ That Oakland health
officer's position is correct. There can be
no possible defense for having a teacher
among young folks who is afflicted with
tuberculosis. I have no doubt that in the
course of time people, young and old, suf
fering from consumption will be Isolated,
but we are not yet quite ready for such
a radical move. -
This matter is not a fad, but, a very
serious business and one that will appeal
to every father and mother. The germs
of consumption can be taken into the sys
tem so easily that no one can guard
against them should they be in the air.
Should the victim have- the least cold 01;
have any membrane in such condition as
to offer a favorable soil to the germs 'he
mischief is done and can/never be un
done. No Board of Health In the country
is doing Its duty that does not follow. tne
example set by the Oakland board.'
Dr. YV. A Meierdlerkâ The examination
of teachers and school children is a meas
ure of great necessity and when parents
understand fully what It means to their
offspring they will no doubt demand that
1 those afflicted with tuberculosis be kept
apart from the others. It Is as essential
that this should be done as It is that
lepers should be kept by themselves.
There Is always a cry against the isola
tion of any particular set of sufferers, but
that will die out when the people are ed
ucated in this matter. I have seen a big
change in public sentiment during the
past few years. Once everybody cried oat
against tae isolation of consumptives be
cause the disease 1b not contagious. Inis
i Is true, but it is very Infectious on ac
; count of the ease with which it may be
. contracted. I was some years with Dr.
Morse and he made a very complete study
; of this question and believed that not only
teachers and pupils but that every citi
zen should be examined to ascertain
whether Jie had consumption or not. I
will tell of one Incident that occurred in
my practice and which will show why I
â  believe consumptive teachers and pupils
! and handlers of food should be isolated.
- I once had a patient who kept a store
i and lived in the rear. He was a fearful
: victim of tuberculosis and he was not
I very particular as to cleanliness. His
, mustache was frequently soiled with nit*
sputum and he would wipe it with 'its
; hands. Once while visiting him he left
i me to serve a customer with a loaf. .He
did it without washing his hands and it
is. possible that by that one act he Mat
death into a famijy. The sputum, when
| dry, Is just so many bacilli, and if but
i one minute germ be absorbed by a child
with a soil rendy to germinate it that ba
cillus will propagate till its ravage* claim
another victim.
'.- Dr. l.efpvreâ lt is surprising to me that
some such action has not already been
taken by boards of health. A school
teacher who carelessly expectorates on
the floor is a menace to the life of every
child in the school. I do not desire to
needlessly alarm, but it is not only by
means of the breathing organs that con
sumption can be contracted. Let me illus
trate. a child cuts its linger. There may
be no poison in the cut. but if the air
should contain some of the perms, and our
schools are mostly old building! and not
any too wt 11 ventilated, and they should
settle on the cut. the evil work is done
and the child Is doomed. Should a teacher
take a handkerchief from her pocket on
I which are some dry germs and should
shake it in a school room she could do
I enough damage to threaten the life of
every child in the school.
â This move -is but oneâ more -step along
I the lines that led to the forbidding of ex
pectoration on the sidewalks, only It Is
far more Important and necessary. San
Francisco should at once take steps to
protect her school children.
Dr. J. A. Blackâ Although I was once
' a teacher. I must confess that I have
j never heard of this important matter be
; Ing taken up In relation to teachers and
pupils. It appears to me that. It Is strik
! ing at the very root of the evil, protecting

COMMON SENSE CURE.
: â  â¢
Remarkable Remedy Which Is Bring- ;
ing Comfort to Thousands of '
. . Sufferers.
Probably, one-half the people who see
this article suffer. from. piles.
It is one of the commonest of diseases
as well as one of the most obstinate and
painful.
People suffer from piles for years and
Just because it is not Immediately fatal
they reÃleet it.
Carelessness causes no end of suffering.
Carelessness about so simple a thing as
piles has frequently caused death.
Hemorrhages occur from no apparent
cause and the loss of blood causes death.
Surnlcal operations for piles often cause
death. Piles are simple in the beginning
and easily cured.
They can be cured even In the worst |
stages without pain, loss of blood or de- â 
tention from business. And the remedy
which will do it surely and completely is ;
the Pyramid Pile Cure.
It ; allays the Itching and inflammation
Immediately, heals the Irritated surfaces,
and after regular use for a short time re-
moves the swelling and puts the rectal
membrane Into Bound, healthy condition. |
The Pyramid Pile Cure cures all forms
of piles thoroughly and permanently.
A great many pile remedies contain
cocaine, morphine and similar dangerous
drugs to quiet the pain and make the pa- '
tient believe he is getting well, but their
action ip temporary and it requires no ar-
gument to show the danger jot using such
remedies.
The Pyramid Pile Cure contains no j
cocaine, narcotic, nor any poisonous drug
whatever, and it is so far ahead of any
other pile remedy for safety and efficiency
as not to be mentioned In the same class.
Any sufferer from piles who will write i
the Pyramid Drug Co. of Marshall, Mich.,
may receive a valuable little book on the !
nature and cure of piles, sent free by â¢'
mall. _ |
Or better yet, ask any druggis* in the
United States what Is the safest and sur-
est pile cure and he will say the Pyramid.
All druggists sell full sized packages of
the Pyramid Pile Cure at 60 cents. They
cure itching piles, protruding, bleeding or
any form of this common and troublesome I
disease. '
the little ones. We all know that no single
disease claims as many victims as con
sumption. The Oakland Board of Health
has started out right, and so far as I
know has set an example to the whole
country.
Health Officer J. 11. Todd of Oakland
was confident yesterday that his resolu
tion would be extended to include chil
dren. He said:
"1 have Just had a talk with Superin
tendent of Schools McC'lymonds and Dr.
W. F. B. Waketield of thÂ« Board of Edu
cation, and both assure me they heartily
believed that the danger of "contagion
among children la quite as great as that
between pupils and teachers and COIISCi
quently that the resolution should be
broad enough to cover both matter- !!â¢â 
"In discussing the question Friday cv.n-
Ing at the meeting of the Health Board
Dr. John T. Kitchmgs told of two cases
coming under his personal observation
where children afflicted with tuberculosis
and having but a year at the most to live
were attending school and exposing all
thoir playmate* to the dread dls. lac.
Now. 1 bellevÂ« that there ar<' very many
such cases In the Oakland school depart
ment.
"I have favored some such action for a
long time, hut never before have deemed
it feasible since there have been teacben
In the < >akland m ho< Is who were knuwn to
!<â¢â¢ OOnmnmptiVeS. S<> far as my pÂ»rs<iti;t]
knowledge goes there are n<me such now,
and therefore this is the time to act."
Dr. Wakefleld, who is one <>f the
three physicians on the School Board. In
dorsed Health Officer Todd's statements.
"This resolution." he declared, "will cer
tainly pass. To take such action Is for
the public welfare, and I am confident
that parents will give us their warmest
support."
"\\> should exclude children as well as
teachers." said Dr. Mailer. "Of course.
wo are to do nothing radical, but It Is
my opinion that the children are far more
likely to give tuberculosis to one another
than they are to catch the disease from
n teacher. For Instance, little children
âand especially fdrlsâ kiss each other a
great deal. Then they loan each other
pencils, which are thoughtlessly stink
into their mouths, nnd they trade lunches,
oftentimes biting at the same apple or
sand.wich."
Another of the physician members of
the Oakland Board of Kducation Is Dr.
Myra W. Knox. It is her contention that
a child afflicted with tutMTculosis. aside
from all other considerations, should
spend Its time in the open air np<l not in
tho schoolroom poring over hooks.
The third physician on the t>,ikland
School Hoard is Dr. W. J. Wilcox. Not
only would he exclude consumptive teach
ers, bnt he would debar consumptive chil
dren from the privileges of the public
schools.
I>rs. J. p. Dunn and Frank T,. Adams,
both health officers of Oakland, indorse
Dr. Todd'i stand.
A dissenting opinion comes from Dr. J.
If. Belfrldce, also of Oakland, who is a
homeopath. He declares that tuberculosis
is communicated only through heredity.
The automatic coin-controlled telephone
Is in considerable use In Merlin, and if
the results of the experiments are satis
factory this means of communication
will be used all over Germany.

TWO FINE SPECIMENS
Of Physical Manhood.
No form of athletic exercise demands j
such perfect physical condition as >nze j
, flKhtintc. Every muscle In the body must |
lie fully developed and supple, and 'he
, heart, lungs and stomach must act to per-
! faction.
Whether we indorse prize flphtlnif or not
it is. nevertheless, Interesting to km.w
the manner by which men arrive at such
| physical perfection.

lant opponent, Tom Bharkey, it. the srt.it-

course of training and the lirst ar.'l
Important part of this tralnlnK w.i- t>.
the stomach in condition and to k<-eip the

This was not done l>y a secret patrnt

I tablet sold by drujrcriHts tinder name* of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and compo*Â«-d
of the digestive ferments which i\-r\

Champion Jeffries says: "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets prevent acidity, strength-
en the stomach and Insure perfect lik.-. â¢->-
tlon. They keep a man in fine physical
condition. ' Signed. James J. Jettrles,
champion of the world.
The gallant tighter. Bharkey, says: "S.u-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets remove all <l.s-
COmfort after eatinK. They reÂ«t the ss t i m-
ach and restore it to a healthful "o;:dl-
i toln. I heartily recommend them."
SiÃned. Tbos. J. Bbarkey.
The advantages of the dally use of Stu-
art's Dj> sjtepsla Tablets is that they k--Â»p
people well and ward off sickness and nre
â¢ qually valuable to well persons as to ihe
dyspeptl - s. Another advantage is that
th>s.- tabl -is contain no cathartics, or pol-
BOns of any character, but 'imply Ihjcs-
i tive ferments which are found in every
! healthy Stomach, and when digestion is
Imperfect it is because the stomach i^cks
some of these elements, and Sruart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets supply it.
They are no cheap cathartic, but a pcr-
1 fectly safe and efficient digestive .md me
j demand for them in greater than the eale
of all other so-called dyspepsia cures coni-

Last night Morse armed himself with

omeer W. C. Ir-lne sent the unfortu

worked half an houi to put him into
recognizable shape." Harty was then put

hud lnfilcted his attentions on her and she
had repulsed him, but made up with him
for fear that Morse would carry out his
threats against her life and do her pa

Morse has served a term in San Quen

DOUGHNUTS AND A GOLD
BRICK FOR TWO COPPERS
POLICEMAN McSORLET of the Southern Station Is in deep distress.
It Is not because he has been cited to appear before the Police Commis
sioners, but simply for the reason that he can not find the man who
presented him with a beautifully gilded brick.
Since becoming one of the "foinrst" Mac has evinced a hatred for
gold brick operators and he never missed an opportunity to so express him
self. Frequently during his dreams he could see myriads of yellow-tinted
bricks suspended in midair, each derisively pleading with him to buy the
bunch. The "heap good Indian" who is absolutely necessary for the suc
cessful completion of a gold brick swindle has In his imagination dogged
his footsteps, begging him to listen to his story of how he became possessed
of a valuable brick that had been stolen by a pirate and burled in a place
remote from civilization.
"They'll never catch me," mused "Mac" whenever he heard his fellow
officer* tell how some tenderfoot had bought a gold brick "I'm too wise
for them fellers."
It so happened that two practical jokers of the Southern Station learned
of "Mac's" boast and they decided to present him with â  gilded brick, "Just
to see how he would take it." Procuring one that served as an ornament
in a Market street cigar store they placed it In a fancy box, and after ad
dressing It to McSorley, sent It to police headquarters. Friday evening Cap
tain Spillano. who had received tno package, sent for McSorley and handed
him the brick.
"Some Chrlftmaa present, I suppose?" Innocently inquired the Southern
Station captain.
â¢â¢] guess so, captain," modestly answered "Mac." "You know, I have so
many friends and they never forget me around Christmas."
With the package under his arm the enthused policeman left the City
Hall and went to his home, on Twenty-Eighth and Mission streets.
"What have you there," Inquired his wife, as she cast admiring glances
at the box which '"Mac" had under his arm.
"Just â  little present," gleefully answered the copper, with a satisfied
smll'*: "Me Mends would insist on giving me something."
"Mac" then proceeded to open the package. As he pulled out the gold
brick he almost fainted. "With at- oath, he fired it against the wall, break
ing a valuable looking-glass.
â¢â¢They've got me at last." he feebly remarked, as he sank exhausted in
an easy chair. "I'll get even, though the heavens fall and Chief Lees is
thrown out of office."
After considerable trouble Mrs. McSorley finally pacified her Indignant
husband. Since then he has been looking for the man who "Jobbed" him,
but without success.
"Handsome Willie' Harrison, who was recently caught in a restaurant
partaking of his favorite diet of w.irm doughnuts, is also the victim" of , a
practical Joke Knowing Harrison's penchant for doughnuts,- the policemen
who sent th.- gold brick to McSorley decided to have some fun with Har
rison Qolngno a bakery, they bought two doughnuts that looked as If they
could do a hard day's work. After placing them In a Japanese box they
paid a messenger boy to take the package to police headquarters. Harrison
was elated when he was handed the box. thinking that It had been sent him
br some lady admirer. Meeting several of his brother officers; who were
standing in the corridor, the proud policeman Invited them to the nearest
saloon where he "set 'em up." As his friends seemed anxious to know what
the package contained. Harrison proceeded to open it.
Catching a glimpse of the two doughnuts. Harrison with an oath threw
the box and contents into the street Like McSorley; he Is now engaged
in trying to find the perpetrator of the Joke. it is said of Harrison that
whenever he passes a bakery the doughnuts that serve for a display rise
up and bow to him. Harrison, however, says that this is not true. -;-r>

A GULLIBLE FARMER.
â¦
Eth'n Button, a farmer who halls from
Dakota, has tost all faith in mankind and
also four hundred hard-earned dollars.
He visited police headquarters last nipht
and unfolded â  tale of man's duplicity
that aroused the sympathy of his audi
tors, hardened as they are to stories and
scenes of crime.
Mr. Hutton stated that he had come
to this State for the purpose of Investing
In a ranch, but a plausible scoundrel, who
gavo his name as Richard Marion, re
lieved him of the amount by Inducing him
to participate .In a game of studhorse
poker.

with tears In his eyes, "and this fellow
Marion called on me at the hotel and In
troduced himself to me. Bj some manner
he learned what I was In quest of and
he stated that he was an agent for a
wealthy man who was anxious to dispose
of a ranch and would be â¢willing to accept
a small amount down from a reliable
party. He Induced me by his description
of the place to accompany him to San
Francisco and on our arrival he made an
appointment to meet mo at his office,
which was on Market street above Eddy.
The next day I called there and as l
entered the room some men who were
seated at .1 table hastily covered up some
cards with a cloth and this fellow Marlon
apologized to Â«no and said they kite â¢ >.

draw but the supposed agent told me to
sit down and watch' the game anil as soon
as he played his hand be would proceed
to business. They then tempted me to
play and like a fool I did so. and before
long I lost my $100â every dollar I had in
the World. Marlon took m.- down t.ie
street and then lost me in a crowd and
since then I have not seen him." ,
Mutton gave the police- a good descrip
tion of the swindler and they recognized
him a.Â« being an old operator. The scheme
employed by Marion is an old one and la
practiced by a regular gang, who lie In
wait In Portland for gullible men like
Hutton.
The later Is despondent, as he waa left

SKY-CLIMBING PRICES MAKE

The New Almaden Not Sold, but
Hunting for Ore â Manager
Bulmore Retires Janu
ary 1.
There Is a big quicksilver boom abroad
in California, and as one result the old
Guadeloupe quicksilver mine in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, not far from New Alma
den, has been bonded by some Napa peo
ple represented by. John I^avie of that
place. This and other circumstances
present. a possibility that this Important
property, which has been idle since tM,
may be reopened In the future.
The property belongs to the Coleman
' estate and Is controlled by James V. Cole
man, but has been in litigation for years,
as it is yet, and this reduces the chances
lof early operation. No sale has been ef
fected, and whether the people securing
j the option directly represent adequate
capital or not is not known.
This simple bonding proposition, simi
lar to many more Important ones effected
fvery week, has started the report that
"the Rothschilds" of London had secured
this and the old and great New Almaden
quicksilver mine. It Is proper in these
days to smell the Rothschilds behind
every mining deal In which particulars
are unknown. But the report is baseless
as far as the New Almaden Is concerned.
Superintendent C. C. Derby Bald last
night:
â¢â¢There is not the slightest basis for
the report as far as the New Almaden is
concerned. The Guadaloupe has been
bonded by some Naps people, who have
been around there for a week. \\ hat will
follow. l do not know. That mine once
reached a production of MOO flasks In one
month, but has been idle for fifteen years
with only a watchman around. Report
has apparently got the Almaden mine of
Spain mixed up with the New Almaden
here. "That great mine has long been
operated by the Spanish Government,
which has owed the Rothschilds and
given them control of its production,
guaranteeing so many flasks per month
and giving, the London Interests virtual
control of the world's quicksilver mar
ket-- It is understood that the Roths
childs made further loans during th*> late
war and have now made over the mines
themselves."
James V. Coleman said last night in re
gard to . rhe deal: "1 have bonded the
mines, but as a pan of the estate !s .uiil
in litigation there is a possibility of the
deal falling through. I cannot say if
preparations are l eTni made tor reopen
ing the mine. 1 know nothing beyond the
fact that I have bonded the property. I
cannot. In fairness to the prospect
ive buyers, fain. ess any tlv prOS) but
buyers, Â«i\Â« any names, but
the deal was made through John Davit of
Naps The property is. I believe, very
valuable and I should have developed it
myself bad not these capitalists made
overtures for its purchase. '
The Ouadalupe deal Is one ; of the re
sults of the boom In quicksilver. The de
mand exceeds the. supply, as In the case
of Iron, popper, sine and lead, and for
several months prices have been mount
ing. From $36 the price has gone to J32
for sport, the last week having Keen an
advance if $152 per â â¢â¢* "'''a 'pounds.
The boom is stimulating, then, ten or a
dozen Important producing mli â  to
search for new- ore bodies and crowd pro

WeaK Kidneys Caused by Over-
| worK, by LiftiQg or a Strain.
IIP! i : ' ' â  â 
We do not always know the constant
danger that confronts us through all
the dally walks of life. It may be an
accident or sudden illness; or perhaps
a disease that has been stealing upon
us from day to day.
. It used to be considered that only
urinary troubles were to be traced to
the kidneys, but now modern science
' proves that nearly all diseases have
their beginning in the disorder of these
most important organs.
Now by this is not meant that you
should overlook all the other organs
and merely look after the kidneys.
Your other organs may need atten-
tion â but your kidneys most, b-
they do most.
If you are sick do not neglect your
kidneys, because as soon as they arÂ«
well they will help all the other organs
to health.
The kidneys may get weak or dis-
eased from a thousand and one causes;
from overwork, worry, a simple cold,
fmm lifting, a strain, or excess in high
living.
ntht-rs may suffer from diabetes,
dropsy, swelling of the feel and ankles.
rheumatism, bad Mood, gout, gISWSI.
â¢ at i rrh of the I. ladder, si
anaemia, nervousness, h'-.idache or
neuralgia.
All these symptoms are due to kidney
trouble, and the most prompt and ef-
fectual cure is Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
koot, th'- great kidney remedy.

SOCIETY GIRL JOINS
THE TIVOLI CHORUS
IT will be !\ surprise to the averag*
thrator-goer to know that therp Is a
society plrl at present parkin? a
*p**ar in tho T!voli chorus: but such
is the case. The jroung lady. Is Miss
Gnu Shaln. and th*Â»re Is a method In
her madness. She has decided to adopt
the dramatic profession as a means of
not only earning a living for herself but
also for her mother and two sisters, who
ore to a certain extent dependent on her.
Miss Shaln has been conducting a swell
dancing school for some time and was
very successful la thÂ« venture; but on
th* advice <-f a number of her friends
she called on Manager John Morrlsey
of the Orpheum In reference to Kolrip on
the vaudeville Stage.
In the Interview with the penial man
ager, at his request she both sans: and
danced, making a very favorable im
pression. She was engaged to do the
Orpheum circuit after the Ist of nest
year. She then called on George I.ark.
stage manager of the Tlvoli and was en
paced for the chorus. The young- lady
will in this way become accustomed to
the glare of the footlights and will not
be so apt to be attacked with the usual
Stage frighl when she makes her initial
appearance in vaudeville.
When Interviewed on the Tirol! stape at the rehearsal yesterday she mÂ«>!iiM
perfectly at home on the boards. "I hope if you put anything In thÂ° paper."
sh<- said, "that you will explain my motive for zning on the stage ram simply
adepUnc ihÂ«> dramatic profession as a meau of maklnx Â livln* for n<ft
mvÂ»,>lf, but also my mf.thor and sisters, Bo far I IIKp th^ profession, and every
body Is so klml lo mÂ«>."
Beveral months ago Mrs. Sham was stricken with a severe Illness and th*
doctors decided that an operation of skin-prartlns; was necessary Miss Shaln
was tni.i by the physicians that somebody with a healthy constitution was neces
sary as a subject and she volunteer*.! for tho operation. The treatment was
successful, and Mrs. Shaln to-day is In p^rfert health. Miss Sham has a macnetlrr
style and her friends assert that she will K o rlfcht to the front in the dramatic
profession. She certainly Is endowed with a pretty far,; and makes n strlklne
appearance on the stage.
CHIEF DUNK WILL
NOT LEAVE THE
CHINESE BUREAU
Consul General Ho
Vow Is Neutral.
NO BLAME FOR MUN'S DEATH
TREASURY DEPARTMENT WILL
STAND BY ITS MAN.
Mr. Dunn Enjoys the Confidence of
the Administration and Was
Warned cf the Enemy's
Tactics.
The Chinese Six Companies have de
cided not to take any action whatever
In the. case of Ho Mun, who died In the
County Jail two weeks ago of heart dis
ease. Mun was an Immigrant who had
been landed and arrested immediately
afterward for being unlawfully In the
ITnlted States and was awaiting the dis
position of his appeal on habeas corpus
when he was carried away with the dis
ease with which he had been afflicted for
a long time..
S. V. Costello. the attorney for Ho Mun.
made the statement that Chief Dunn of
the Chinese Bureau had refused to al
low the Chinaman to be visited by a phy
sician, and several friends of the dead
man took Dp the matter. It was found,
however, that Chief Dunn had made it a
part of the regular routine of the office
to have an interpreter visit the detention
shed at the Mail dock and the County
Jail and Inquire of the detained Chinese
immigrants whether any of them were
sick and needed medical aid. Ho Mun
was visit. d every day by Interpreter Da
Sllva of the Chinese Bureau, and on each
occasion Ho Mun made answer that he
waa well and did not need any doctor,
his reason for so doing being explained
by the bureau by the fact that Ho Mun
feared that he would be detained longer
In Jail if he admitted that he was sick.
The autopsy revealed the fact that death
was due to dilatation of the heart, the
effects of a disease of long standing.
â¢ When th.- Chinese Six Companies were
Informed as to the facts of the case they
decided to drop the matter, the original
Intention of the coolie Importing ring hav
ing been to prefer charges of cruelty and
Incotnpetency against Chief Dunn with
the purpose of having him removed from
the bureau and having the vacancy filled
by some man who would be as lax in the
enforcement of the exclusion act as was
the Meredith administration.
Chinese Consul General Ho Vow said
yesterday that the matter had not been
brought officially to his notice, and that
he did not propose to do anything In the
case in his present frame of mind. It had
been proposed by leading spirits engaged
in the business of making a livelihood
by landing Chinese Immigrants that the
Consul General for China should tile a
claim against the United States Govern
ment of $.10,000 damages for the death of
Ho Mun. but judging from the statement
made yesterday by the consul General
the scheme ended in a flash in the pan.
Chief Dunn has the full confidence of
the Treasury Department. It has been
learned from Washington that before he
was sent to this city to take charge of
the notorious bureau he was personally
advised by the Secretary of the Treasury
that If he followed the wishes of the
Treasury Department and rigorously en
forced the provisions of the exclusion act
he would find arrayed against him power
ful and influential individuals and cor
porations whose interests, financial and
political, lay In the direction of a lax
construction of the Intention of the act.
Before starting for this coast Mr. Dunn
was placed in possession of the tran
scripts of testimony in the Investigation
Into the bureau made by Special Treasury
Agents Smith and Llnck. as well as those
of former Investigations, together with
clippings from San Francisco newspapers
and private information as to the person
nel and mode of procedure of the legal
and political ring Interested in the landing
of coolies. He was Informed that the de
partment would support him In the strict
enforcement of the exclusion act. not
withstanding the power and influence of
the. persons defending the coolie slave
trade.
chief Dunn has followed his Instruc
tions to the letter and his every act has
been approved and commended by the
Treasury Department, even in those cases
wherein he and the Collector of Customs
clashed on disputed points. It was prob
ably this confidence In Chief Dunn and
his worthiness of it that led the Secretary
of the Treasury to brush aside the retro
grade scheme to create a new Deputy
Colleetorshlp, the Incumbent of which
office was to take charge of the Chinese
Bureau In place of Chief Dunn, who. not
being the political creature of local influ
ences, is a rankling thorn in the sides of
the highbinder fraternity, Caucasian as
well as Mongolian.

so everybody was put on short allowance.
That did no good, however, as on Novem
ber 19 we were still a long way from any
port and all there was aboard was a
small quantity of barley. We then be
gan catching gooneya and the captain
proved himself to be the most expert
fisherman aboard. When all the rest of
us failed he would hook a bird and we
would be saved from going supper: to
bed.
"On November 24 the men were so weak I
from want of food that they could not !
work thÂ«? pumps and in order to lighten i
the ship 25.000 fed of lumber had to be
Jettisoned. Then the captain determined
to run into Coos Kay, but II came on
to blow hard and we had to stand off i
shore again. On November 2t5 we ran for ;
land again, but could not make it and
the next day it was blowing another gale â¢
Then we ran for the Columbia River, but j
failinK to make it were heading for Flat- '
tery when on November 2S. at H> ; ;{o a. m. J
we sighted the Robert Adamson. We
Immediately hoisted our flag union down !
and the steamer hove to. 1 went aboard :
and told thnn we were short of provisions
and had been living on seagulls for a '
week. Th*y pave us a bountiful supply
and Â«-ver since we have had plenty to eat. !
Everybody on board enjoyed the seagulls .
and I must say that mine tasted good;
but none of us had any d.sire to go tish- i
ing for tht-m again once we got the sup
plies from the Adamson. I can tell you ,
I'm mighty glad that our voyage is about
over.*"
"I flatter myself that I made a very !
palatable di-h out of those seagulls/
said Co<>k Larsm. "Of course I had none
Â«f the . tot. ras to be found In a French
restaurant, but the men enjoyed those ;
birds and said they were superior to wild i
duck. After killing and dressing them I
put them in cold water with a plentiful
supply of sage. Then I boiled them fur :
half an hour and then the gull was ready
for baking or frying. Fried they were
good, hut baked they were excellent.
One gull made a scant meÃl for six men
and mighty glad we were to get it. I can !
tell you. The worsi of it was that there '<
was a couple of feet of water on the I
floor of the galley all the time and that i
prevented me from putting forth my best
efforts. Still a dish of seagull is" very i
appetizing, prepared as 1 tlxed it up, '
when you are hungry."
i never want to go to sea again." said
Mrs. Olsen. and she laughed as she
raught her husband"? eye, "Andrew
tr.'ed very hard to g*t ie to come home
on a steamer from Grays Harbor, but I
wfif determined to make the trip and I
b. r Â«ve. Such weather I have never seen
oetore. It was not that the wind blew
Â»o very hard, but the cross tea was ter
rific. Then we ran short' of pro visions
md a few cans of canned meats were
kept for me. 1 could not eat the seagull*.
as ihe very thought of them made me
sick. ThÂ« people on tho Robert Adamscn
stnt us a small piece of fresh meat and
i never tasted anything so delicious.
Such a dreary, dreary voyage I have,
never hrard of. and not even the prrscn<e
1 T my husband could comfort me. Many
a tlm<- I thought the schooner was going

which everybody is thankful."

Volunteer Camps on the Reservation
Deserted and Will Soon Be
Dismantled.
Thp Presidio present* a rather deserted
appearance since thÂ«Â» departure of the
Forty-ninth Regiment, the last of the vol
unteers to leave for Manila. The only
troops remaining on the reservation are
the few cavalrymen and artillerymen
comprising the garrison of the post and
|r.Â«s than 13d recruits in the casualty
camp. The garrison will he somewhat
augmented In a few days by the arrival
of twenty-five men of Battery D, Third
Artillery, who are marching to this city,
from Sequoia Park, where they have
been doing guard duty since last spring. <
The detachment is commanded by Sec
ond Lieutenant Henry B. Clark and was
attached to the garrison nt San Diego pre
vious to being ordered to the park. Their ;
services are much needed at the Presidio,
and for that reason they are coming here
instead of returning to San Diego. There
are two 12-inch rifles on disappearing car
riages yet to be mounted at the Presidio
and this work will be done by the artil
lery at the post without unnecessary de
lay. All the guns for which emplace
ments have been built at Fort Point and
Fort Baker are now on the ground, but
owing to the small force of artillerymen
at those points the work of mounting
them will require considerable time, es
pecially at Fort Baker, where the de
tachment of ten men on duty Is hardly
sufficient for guard duty alone.
The quartermaster's department at the
Presidio is busily engaged in caring for .
the movable equipment of the volunteer
camps, such as stoves, kitchen utensils,
etc. The tents will not be taken down
until they arc thoroughly dried. in conse
quence of which the deserted canvas vil
lages will in all probability not be wholly
dismantled for some weeks.

AN INDIAN DEMANDS A
MISANTHROPE'S FORTUNE
Sensational Development in the
Fuller Will Case.
Strange Story of a Mystery of Crime and
Conspiracy Involving People Prom
inent in the State.
THE great fight of lawyers and liti
gants to obtain possession of the
fortune left by old Alfred Fuller
of < "1.1. . has assumed a new phase
and another chapter has been
added to the story of mysterious crime
with Which the courts of the State have
been concerned for over two years. This
strange will contest and struggle for a
dead misanthrope's money has already
wrecked reputations, ruined lives and
landed people In jail on serious accusa
tions. Men and women, prominent In Oro
' ill*- and Chi co, have been deeply involved
in plots and counter plots, and some of
the best known attorneys In the State
have been engaged. Absent heirs have
sprung from out of the shadows, .1 will.
found and fathered under circumstances
of suspicion, has been produced, and now.
to add to the confusion, an alleged Illegiti
mate son of the miser has come forward
to claim everything that belonged to the
dead man.
The story of Alfred Fuller's life and
death has occupied much space In the
newspapers. Fuller was an old resident
of Chlco, having won a fortune of at
least $4iJ,uOo in the mines. He never mar
ried and in his later years lived In bitter
ness toward men and women. He was
particularly opposed to women and his
acquaintances inspected that some early
disappointment had turned love for one
woman Into hatred for all. Fuller was
miserly in the extreme and was proud
that his fellows knew it.
He died suddenly In October. I*7. and
every effort to find :i will proved In vain.
If the old man had disposed of his prop
erty he took good care to conceal his
wishes. After waiting a reasonable time
for the discovery of a will or the ap
pearance of heirs the Public Adminis
trator took charge of the estate. Then a
WILLIAM FULLER, INDIAN CLAIMANT OF A FORTUNE
batch of collateral heirs, nephews an.!
nieces, appeared on the scene, cmployinjj
Knight & Hcgge-i;' and laying claim- 10
the estate. By â  singular coincidence It
began to be whispered about th* streets
that old Fuller had left an olographlc will
and stranger still had I- ft practically all
of his property to one of his natural
fnemlesâ a woman. PÂ«-op'o were Incredu
lous but the rumors were Insistent al
though Fuller had been thirteen months
dead and ample time had been Riven for
the discovery of a will.
To add to the sensational developments
it was said that Dr. J. Kills Rodley. who
was then Mayor of ChicÂ©, and John M
Garner, a reputable and respected citi
zen, had signed the document as wit
nesses. During his later yean old Ful
ler had a deep-seated hatred for these
two men and even ordinary observer* be
gan to I**' confused at the complications,
for Rodley was Interviewed and corrob
orated all of the rumors. He Bald that
Fuller had left a will bequeathing Ills
property to a woman and that Garner
and the physician had attached thÂ«lr sig
natures â¢â  witnesses to the testament.
The people of Orovllle and ChlCO were
dumfouna <1. but the assertion of the
Mayor, who was above reproach, eou.d
not be "repudiated. To add to the niys
terv the will was not produced and Mr.yor
Rodley refused to disclose the Identity of
the woman, sÂ«aylng simply that she wan
one of the most prominent resident* of
Chlco.
It was not long, however, before start
ling developments followed. The miMi-
Inn will dropped from nowhere Into tne
malls addressed to a prominent citizen
of Chlco. He found that It waa made In
favor of Mrs. Minnie Housoworth of .'hi
co and he accordingly turned It over to
her. The testament purported to be In the
handwriting of Fuller, who Irft his en
tire fortune, with the exception of JlOft)
to other heirs, to Mrs. Housewnrth. To
make the matter still more notorious it
was shown that Fuller had. during lils
life, no more than a passing acquaint
with Mrs. Houseworth. She tiled the will
for probate, however. 1 and then the row
commenced.
Meanwhile, to make the controversy
more interesting. A. J. I,nndls filed a
claim for $15.0Â»X) against the estate .for
medical service!" alleged to have been >-
celved by Fuller and said to have btÂ»en
acknowledged by him in a rote. Rumors
of fraud *nd conspiracy, perjury and for
Pages II to 20
(fry were now floating In the air. ml
the at - nt heirs took up the cry with en
ergy. Tin Grand Jury b^gan an Investi
gation ar:l the whole northern part ol the,
State was startled whfn Indictment!* w i
found against Garner. Itodley and House
worth for perjury and forgery. Mr*.
Houseworth was arrested in this rlty and
taken to Orovllle a month aeo to await
her trial.
Another explosion quickly followed
when Garner pleaded guilty. Invited sen
tence, turned State's evidence and made,
what he swore was a complete confession
of â  plot hatched by Dr. Rodley. Mrs.
Houseworth and himself to Kerur<> pis
session of the entire estate. Garner de
clared that the will had not been mad*
until a rear after the death of Fuller and
th.it for his part In the affair he was tÂ«Â»
receive $.7>JO. The contest of the will h
the absent heirs has b*>en postponed until
Dr. Itodley and Mrs. Houseworth can bÂ«
tried for the offense of which they arÂ«
accused.
It was thought that the last develop
ment had come In the remarkable case,
but day before yesterday a new sensa
tion, ami probably the greatest In th*
case, wan sprung. It Is the Introduction
of an alleged illegitimate son of Fuller,
a half-breed Indian, who iii known now.
If he wax not before, as Wllll Fuller.
The Indian claimant to all that Fuller
owned Is a mystery like many other* In
the case. Rut he Insist* that he can es
tablish his relationship to Fuller ard
prove that the old man publicly acknowl
edged him as his son. lliÂ« claim h.iÂ«
been taken up by Attorney Henry E.
Carter, who was a deputy Attorney Gen
eral under ex-Attorney General FitÂ»
gÂ«rald.
In order to establish the Indian* claim
ri. , man Fuller* history Is reviewed from
the time when the old mi*' wan toll
keeper on the Sonera and Mono rood.
Th* Indian declares that his father wMlo
acting as tollkeeper wooed and won his
mother, an Indian woman known a*
Jenita. lie claims that he was born In
I*7l and he says in a petition whan >. *
attorney haÂ» filed with the. trial court
th<:t he has ampl* proof of his acknowl
edgment by his father. FÂ«r that reason
he want" the alleged fraudulent will **t
aside, the absent heirs sent about tnrlr
bimlnesa and the entire rotate given i<Â»
him.- For mnrt of his life he has Jived In
Tuolumne County. where he expects t<>
gather the evidence to support his claim.
His petition will not be hÂ»urd until th#
early spring. and meanwhile th^ other
claimants will try to keep out of th*
State penitentiary or prevent thenvelve*
from leavlni?- the contest profitless.

WILLING TO PLAY
WITH THE INDIANS
! First they would, then they wouldn't,
id now they will and will not play with
ie Chicago University football team or
ie Carlisle Indian kickers.
Those are the separate and distinct
mtral states the blue and cold eleven
aye passed through. At present the
ien have agreed to play, but only on cer
iln conditions. Wfc.-thcr these condi
<mn precedent will bo fuUUled det>ends
iÂ«'U rhrÂ«<- <M*tinct bodies of men.
Yesterday was a busy day for Irwin J.
uma. manager Â«.f the University of Cali
...r-ifi tfitm, â G4trrÂ«4^^Jt>chr!Â«mn4 â t fee
rrit-n of thÂ«Â» eleven which met Stanford
ThanksglvlnK <luy. The positive refusal of
ihf 1. am t.i play Hth^r ihe Chlcajjoans or
th<- Indians molted away before the so
liritious ursinss of <;ochran. wh<i. afti-r
a lone talk with each member of tho
team, finally persuaded them to Rive as
surances that they would play one of the
Eastern elevens during the holiday week.
The. assurances were forthcoming, but
tacked on to them were a couple of
"rider*," the llrst of which is that the
faculty allow Captain Whipple to play
with the team and ihe second that the
proceeds of the same go toward the con
struction Â«>f a training clubhouse for the
a-thletic teams of the university.
The tlrst condition will not be realized
for the faculty and President Wheeler
have refused to rescind their actions in
\Vhlpple> case. It is settled that the
California captain must not play, for he
ha* been MUpaoded from the university
until the iirst nf the year, barred from the
college grounds und campus. But this, it
lr t-l&inu'd. will not deter the team from
playliijr. and they will waive their con
tentions in support of Whippie if Ruaran
lo^d a clubhouse from the proceeds of the
earn*.
It ha* Hlways been a pet scheme of
Cochran to secure a clubhouse for the
â  thVtle teams of California. His word
has RrÂ«-ai weight with the collegians and
It Is bHleve-1 that all opposition will bo
rÂ«movÂ»Â»(i and thai the recalcitrant plc
f=kln kickers will jrlve their ttnn! and as
sured consent to meet the Kasterners.
The bluÂ»" and crold eleven will meet to-

CHAMPIONS AT
GOLF ON THE
LOCAL LINKS
John Lawson Piays Brilliantly
the Game of the ''Hoot
Mons."
The open competition for members of
golf clubs on the Pacific Coast, the quali
fying rounds of which had been played
during the past two weeks, began yester
day on the links at the Presidio. The
qualifying round was over eighteen holes,
mi-i!.ii play, but the competition Is at
mutch play, the llrst and second !<Kin<ls
over eighteen holes, ,the semi-final and
tlnal rounds over thirty-Fix ' holes. ThÂ«
sixteen play. making the lowest scores
were entitled to enter the first round of
the competition. C. R. Winslow. of the
San Francisco Golf Club and P. E. Bowlâ
of the Oakland Golf Club retired, thus
permitting a representative of the army,
iiujur 11. J. Gallegher, and one of the
navy, lieutenant W. G. Miller, each of
whom made 111. to enter the competition.
The afternoon was clear and bright and
the northerly wind had put the course
into good condition, a* from its sandy
nature it dries out quickly. The greens
are somewhat rough and played unevenly,
owing to the fact of the graiw on some of
them being stiff and offering considerable
resistance to the bail, while on others it
was short and allowed the bull to roll
easily. The absence of C. P. Hub! of
the Oakland Golf Club removed the
strongest player on the Adams Point
links from the competition, while Oak
land's second player, E. R. Folger, fell
before John l*nwson. who in probably the
â¢transect golfer in this city or the vicin
ity.. The closest match was played be
tween Charles Page and J. \V. Byrne, the
former ending the first nine holes 3 down,
but wiping off the score and ending 1 up.
The tull result of the play was as fol
lows:
Lieutenant W. O. Miller. V. S. N\, beat
Lansing O. Kellogg C up. 4 to play.
Charles l'age beat J. \V. Byrne. l up.
John Lawt.cn beat E. K. Folger â¢; up. 5

H. M. Fitzgerald beat F. S. Stratton 2
up. 1 to play.
H. B. Goodwin won from G. D. Green
wcod by default.
S. L. Abbott Jr. beat Major H. J. Gal
legher 0 up, â¢Â» to play.
N. W. Howard of the Santa Catallna
Golf Club entered the qualifying round,
but his score of 113 left him seventeenth.
j ..r Just outride the chosen sixteen. The
I only player from any club outside of San
Francisco and neighborhood to qualify
was E. Conde Jones of ili>Â« Loi Anj;eles
Country Club, who made 10] in the quali
fying round. In the second round of
tht* competition the eight winners will be
matched v follows: Lieutenant W. G.
Miller vs. Charles I'age; John I*awson
vs. \\ P. Johnson; hi. Conde Jones vs.
It. M. FltZKerald. and S. L. Abb Jr.
vs. H. B. Goodwin. These couples will
play as circumstances permit, but the en
tire competition must bo concluded nut
later than next Saturday, the 16th lnst.
Several ludi.-s have been round the Pre
sidio course during the past week. On

ed a score of 73; and on Tuesday Mlsg
Helen Chesebroutfh went round in S2.
On the latter day Miss M. O'Connor and

BIG SPORTING EVENTS DECIDED
CENTERVILLE AND BELMONT PLAY
A TIE GAME FOR CHAMPIONSHIP
Centerville O, Belmont 0.
THAT means that the football
championship of the Academic
Athletic League is still unde
cided. For two long, weary
and chilling: hours the Btudents of the
Belmont and Centerville schools fired
away at one another without settling
their many differences. Twice during
the game every indication of a touch
down first filled the youthful breasts
of the Belmont rooters with prospec
tive victory, and soon after the same
thing on the reverse side provided a
short-lived Joy for Centerville.
Both schools were well represented
by makers covered with every
description of ribbon and streamer as
well as armed with blatant tin norns
that never ceased working. The game
was exciting: enough from the stand-
point of the young, and many mothers
will find hoars* sons on this account.
Belmont kicked off to the flve-yard
line and then Onterville began to
push and shove and plunge and rear
until Helmont got a return of the
ball on a fumble. Fighting backward
and forward, both teams settled down
to hard work, but Belmont seemed too

and glum.
Then it was Centenrllle's turn to

Open Evenings:
and around the ends. Straight for the
goal post* they forged their way Inch
by inch until two yards from the Bel
mont goal line. Here they froze, how
ever, not being ah].' to cross the lino
that brings the score that sets the
youthful heart afloat with Joy. After
this Bclmont worked the ball out .if
danger.
The second half showed more kick
ing and some splendid playing by
Sherman, half, and Lindley, fullback,
for Belmont. Punting . was resorted
to, making the game a free and open
one.
The crowd in the stand* cheered and
â tamped to keep a sluggish circulation
moving, while the ball on the field os

Margin.
AU-Californias 4, San Franciscos 2.
While yesterday's contest between the
locals and the all-star aggregation corraled
by "Jim" McDonald was not torrid
enough to keep Official Scorer Stapleton
from freezing to death, still it was lively
enough in spots to enthuse the half thou
sand spectators who saw the game. Tho
All-Californlas had no easy time landing
the victory, as "Uncle Henry's" nine
young men played for keeps. Timely and
well placed hits and excellent support of
Knelt gave the picked nine its initlaJ
game with the Fnscos. Knell and "Fire
men" Fitzpatrick were the opposing
pitchers, and their work was 01 equal
merit. "Khz" allowed eight hits off his
delivery and managed to fan four, the re
doubtable Herti measure being taken
twice out of, the four times he came to
bat.
Van Haltren scooped six long files with
out a miss and earned hearty applause.

"Heney" Krug rushed to second to

Hildt'brand. and the moment the ball
touched the right fielder's hands Lock

by a shade. In the sixth the All-Callfor
nias scored again. Lockhead hit safely
over first and marched to second when
Bhanahan was pret-ented with a base on
balls. McCarthy singled to right, filling
the bases. Knell hit to first, who threw j

The Kens at the Garden at 10 o'clock to
night was exciting when the winners
swept over the line, endln; one of tho
most sensational contests of its kind ever
given Ii this country.
Ten thousand peoplo saw thÂ« finish.
Prom C o'clock to the end the pace main
tained was heartbreaking. It was nothing
more nor less than n continuous series of
fprints. first one and then another of the
rider* electrifying the crowd with a ter
rific burst of speed.
, All the teams worked In fifteen an.l
twenty minute relays, but frequently on<>
man relieved his mate In the middle of -i
hnir-ralsing sprint. Not for a single In
stant did a single rider leave the track
after Â»i Hock. The moment n man dis
mounted from his wheel he was wrapped
In a bathrobe or blanket and hi* handler*
went to work on him In plain view of tho
spectators.
The last ten minute, of the raw were
ridden at a record-breaking pace, first one
and then the other of the leaders golnir
to the front and setting a terrific clip.
Beginning the last lap. Pierce, who had
been trailing tho bunch, suddenly shot to
the front, and he crossed tho finish line
three lengths before Babenek. who had
been lying In fourth place daring the lon
sprints. MrEachern finished third and
Champion Miller was fourth.
After th" race the seventeen prize wln
ne-Â«i were paraded about tho track. Bob
by Walt hour, the individual prize winner
who finished riding at 7:H, also paraded
and to him the, crowd gave ltd heart Irst
welcome. Th- men then went to their
training quarters and after a rest pro
ceeded to their respective hotels.
Only one accident occurred during th"
day. That happened shortly after 1
o'clock during a long sprint. Babcock
fell, carrying Fischer with him. As a re
sult of the fall the bunch becamo separ
ated ana resulted in Miller. Maya an
Walthonr gaining a lap on the others.. An
Investigation showed that the acctdent
was entirely due to careless riding on the
port of Rabcoek and the referee rtoctd*<l
to give back all the laps lost by the un
lucky riders except the offender, who waj
penalized one lap.
The best previous record for JÂ«? hours
was made by Her In the Garden In ISDO
when In a six-day race, he rode 21Â» mile*
and 6Â»Â» yards. The combined mileage of
Miller and Waller for 142 hours, therefore
beats Millers record by M.l miles. " '

1 his life In this city last July. is the Wolf

The 110.000 Insurance now in the hands
of the Public Administrator will be paid

i Wolfsohn appears In the Ilcsh and estab
lish**;- his identity more clearly than by
I affidavits.
The insurance company ii more deeply
: interested than most others and has
t caused full investigation. The chain of
evidence established is so convincing that
General Agent Jones has informed the
New York oillce regarding his conclusions.
The pivotal poll of evidence is centered
around the woman May O'Neill. Her re
! lations with the dead man were such that
j she could not fail to positively identify
â¢ her former friend. She furnished Wolf
sohn the money to go East and make â 
'â¢ new start, and had it not been for fear
. of publicity and not permitting her name
, to be Inserted in the policy she to-day
j would stand as the winning "beneficiary.
ENGLAND PREPARED TO
CHECK INTERVENTION
JCEW YORK. Dec. â¢â A Sun cable from
London says a couple of weeks ago It was
announced that Chief Justice Gregorow
< ski and other civil officers of the Trans
vaal had arrived at Lourenzo Marquez
i from Pretoria, en route to Cape Town.and
suggested the mission was to sue for
peace at the feet of Queen Victoria's high
commissioners. As the war was then
young arÂ»U the Boers had matters their
own way. it m.-'i strange that Kruger
would so soon assume the role of suppli
ant, hut It now appears the mission was
j not bound to Cape Town, but Europe.
They propose to visit every European
I capital with- the object of interesting the
I powers in the cause of the South African
republics, and will reach Paris the end
'of next week. Judging by the aroused
temper of this country and the known
views of a. majority of the Government
it may safely be asserted the mission is
foredoomed to failure, whether or no
any power is so foolish as to interfere.
Th- â¢â  is. however, abundant evidence
to show that the British Government will
not be taken by surprise If France should
endeavor to lend the Boers diplomatic
help and that such mediation would be
polltlely but decisively declined.
In view of what might happen, the Brit
| ish Government has been quietly making
j a variety of preparations, some of which
! are known all over the world, because
they could not be concealed, such as con
centration of the Mediterranean and
channel fleets and the commissioning: of:
] a small special service squadron. There
. are other preparations of which the pa
i triotie newspapers have made little men
j tlon Â«nd which have had no prominence
Iby special request of the Government.
' AltOKether. there Is warrant for the state
ment that If any European power should
attempt to Interfere Kmrlmihl would re
spond by mobilizing the entire Beet and
calllnt; out the volunteer forces, naval and
military.

FERRIS HARTMAN
HIGHLY HONORED
AN audience that almost hurst the
./ \\ Tivoll asunder, first by its magni-
J{~~^, tude and then by its enthusiasm,
gathered last night at the second
coming of Ferris Hartman. and welcomed
him back to the scene of his former tri
umphs. We have clustered on eminences,
we have illuminated, sky-rocketed and
brass-banded in honor of our returning
soldiers; we have zipped and boomed and
ah-ed and re ra rah nd for our football
ers; we have bravo ed and brava-ed and
bravl-ed for the operatic asterism so
lately gone before; but the combined
clamor of these hysterical hours of olirs
were paltry compared with the ebullient
ovation accorded to our own "Teddy."
< Â»f course he made a speechâthere was
no denying the demand. And the wonder
of it is that ho Rot throuÃh It as he did.
for there wan a genuine gulp with every
nee. This is what be naid:
"Xrfidies slid Gentlemenâ l mean Boys
and Girls (gulp): Iâ l've been Eastâ ln the
effete East. I asked "Tommy Leary what
effete Bast meant and he said It meant
â¢you're lucky.' But 1 want to say th. y

I had to treat three or four times Ilrst,
butâ they treatedâ eventually. That story
about my being destitute is a mistake. 1
was never destitute. If I had been I
would have let you know In a most touca-
Ing manner. When I read, l read that
article about me. ! wasâ paralyzed. Then
I went around the corner and got good
and paralyzed."
And th<*n he thanked everybody neatly
and tidily with a "God bless you all for
the best friends I have in the world "
Hartman is not only at home in San
Francisco, but he is at home in "The Tar
and the Tartar." It used once to be a pot
diversion of mine to see him In the role
of Muley, which is the biggest sort of a
part and boisterously humorous from the
iirst entrance to the last exit. Hartman's
work is absolutely artistic, despite the
low order of the comedy. He takes id
vantage of every opportunity given him
by the book and makes others for him
self. Â»He Is working all the time and suc
ceeds In being funny most of it. He is
neither tiresome nor silly, but conscien
tious and good-natured. But it Is needless
to hand him any more bouquets, for he
was deluged with flowers on the stage.
"The Tar and the Tartar" la a rattling
comic opera, with a clever libretto and
music of positively remarkable merit. The
orchestration Is so superior to that of
other operas of this type as to be in a
(lass by itself. The costuming Is exceed
ingly picturesque, and between the bril
liance of color on the stage and the bril
liance of the music in the air the parts of
the opera that might be slow do not drag
for a. moment. The company. does well
even Schuster, with his smoke-colored
voice, acting with spirit. Annie Myers is

TO LAW OVER

ment Set Aside.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
M Broadway, Dec. 9.
Another sensational suit over property
rights between the children of the lato
Mrs. Lou!na Bam rle of Alameda was
I filed to-day, charges of menace, threats
| ami undue influence being prefern-d
I against Adolr-h H. Bauerle. one of the

the mother, died In August of this year,
but on January 11 preceding, so the com
plaint states, she exeeuteu a gir
of the property mentioned to her son
Adolph.
It is declared by the plaintiffs that at
the time of executing this deed Mrs.
BauerU was of unsound mind. weak, de-
I bilitated and Incompetent to execute a
deed. It is furtner alleged that Bauerle
compelled his mother to sign the instru
men by menace and threats of "declar
ing to the world that she had not been a
woman Of good character."
More than this. !t is alleged that be
cause he was with her every day tho
defendant entirely dominated Mrs

undue Influence.
The complaint concludes by asking that
I the deed in question be canceled, and that
: such ether relief as may be necessary be
given the plaintiffs. Snook & Church are

HEALTH OFFICE CLAIMS.
Auditor Will Pass Those Pronounced
Valid by Superior Court.
The remittitur in the ease of Health
Inspector John N. Colter, who sued to
compel Auditor Wells to sign the demands
of some twenty health officials who were
employed under- a former decision of
Judge Hunt, was received by the Auditor
from Judge Murasky's court yesterday
morning. The Auditor will nowVslgn the
demands, notwithstanding the opposition
of Mayor Phelan and City Attorney Lane
wtto thought that the â  .i->. suould' ho ap
pealed to the Supreme Court. Mr. Weils
considers that since there are two Supe
rior Court decisions in favor of the em
ployes, who all performed the labor for
which they presented demands, that it
gives him sufficient authority to pass
them. He thinks that the city has been
put to enough expense already In the mat

the case to a higher court would be
greater than the sum total of the claims

of a decision sustaining the lower courts

DEATH RESULTED FROM A SCRATCH.
OAKLAND. Dec 9.â E. M. Lay
mance, the father of M. J. and
J. Walter Laymanee, died thin
morning from lockjaw, after
suffering for some days. The cause
of the lockjaw was a very slight
wound on a finger of his left hand.
Incurred while cutting some wood. It
was only a scratch, but must have
been Infected with rust or some poison,
for lockjaw resulted and in spite of
every effort he died this morning.
That death should have resulted
from fo slight a wound is a remark
able feature in this case. For two
days the scratch did not cause any
inconvenience and was treated merely
as an ordinary scratch. Then pain
began and one week ago yesterday

was applied, but without avail.

SIMPSON ASKS
AN ACCOUNTING
OF NUSBAUMER
Says Money Is Due on
a Settlement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Dec. 9.
R. F. Simpson to-day tiled a suit against
Emit Nusbaumer demanding an account
ing- frtm Nusbaumer in a settlement made
by Nusbaumer with the late Joseph Mac
donough for Simpson, who was the con
tractor for the Albany Hotel, which Mac
donough was building. The amount
claimed is' not specified in the complaint,
but a demand for an accounting Is made,
and it its claimed outside of the complaint
that anywhere between $2000 and HJOO is
due Simpson.
Simpson was the contractor, for the Al
buny Hotel, Joseph Macdonough, since
dead, being the owner of the property.
The affairs of the proprietor, contractor.
Bub-contractors and material men became
very much tangled and mechanic's lien*
to a very large amount were filed against
the building, and Simpson found that he
could get no money from Macdonough.
He employed Moore & Martin and began
buit against Macdonough and all of those
who had tiled liens against the building in
order to protect himself. But he found in
Macdonough a man who was willing and
anxious to fight, and the suits became
more and more complicated. At last Kmil
Nusbaumer was taken into the case with
the consent of Moore & Martin and he
was given the work of settling up all
claims and untangling the affairs. This
Nnsbatuner did, and Simpson received, as
he says in his complaint. $1116 SO as his
balance after claims .i A nil b<*fn paid
The suit to-day was not unexpected, for
Simpson has In en making frequent asser
tions that Nusbaumer did not make a* full
settlement with him. and he has openly
accused the attorney of holding a portion
of the money due him. There has been
much ill feeding between the two, and at
one time they met and weapons were
PANHANDLE EXTENSION
IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE
PARK SUPERINTENDENT Me-
LABEN TALKS OF GRADES.
The following correspondence between
Mayor Phelan and Superintendent Mc-
Laren of Golden Gate Park explains It
self, and will be Interesting In view of thÂ«
coming election to decide the question of
Issuing bonds for the* extension of ' the
park panhandle to Van Ness avenue:
December 6, iv.<?
John McLaren. .Superintendent Golden
Gate rark. Cityâ My Dear Sir: Should the
citizens vote for the extension of the park
panhandle to Market street, there will be
a question an to the bent mean* of improv
ing the property. There Is a steep ascent
for a few block* on the line of the exten
sion, fully as steep, according to the official
surveys, as Golden Gate avenue, from
Scott to Devlsadero. which approximates
10 per cent. This grade will have to be re
duced or a winding road will have to be
constructed, and as the blocks condemned
are 273 feet wide, the land. I am informed,
will admit of almost any kind of treatment.
I am assured by engineers and architects
that it Is a simple matter to make this
driveway, which is the most natural, direct
and beautiful approach to the park, satis
factory in every' IWDMt As the question
of (trades will be raised and a-, the people
should possess all information possible, I
wish you would please Bend me your Idea
an to the best mean* of treating the land
and let me know particularly what should
be the established grade 'according to your
views and how deep would be the cut* on
the hill top and how the sides of the same,
whon made, can be treated by the landscape
cardener so as to produce the best effect.
These are practical questions and I am
mire that you have the Information at hand.
Yours very truly.
JAMES D. I'HELAN, Mayor.
Office of the Commissioners of Golden Gate
Park.
PAKK OFFICE. Dec. 9. 1SÂ».
Hon. James D. I'helan. Mayor of San
Francisco. New City Hallâ Dear Sir: Re
garding the proposed cut through Oak-strttt
hill the erroneous supposition seems to have
ealned credence that it would be necessary
to make a deep cut, whereas In reality the
deepest cut necessary to give a ( per cent
grade (which should be the maximum) will
only be twenty-six feet, and that for a dis
tance of only three blocks, and the average
slope Iwo to one.
Of course It Is not desirable to give a uni
form elope along the whole distance; the '
effect should be undulating and rolling,
varying In steepness from one and a half
to one to a slope Of three to one. thereby
giving a natural and easy appearance, rather
than one of stiff uniformity. The width of
the block bring HI feet allows ample spare
to give this variety, both In the form of thÂ«
slopes 'and In the . curvature* of the drive
ways. Excellent examples of a two to one
slope such as I* proposed for the panhandle
cut between Stelner and Webster streets
can be seen on the grassy slope opposite the
Cyclers' Kest In Golden Gate Park, where
the old Casino once .stood, and on the North
Ridge road at Us easterly Junction with the
main drive.
It has been suggested that In order to pre
serve the/present grade of the cross streets
brldcen be erected across the drive at
Webster, Kill more and Stelner streets, over
which electric cars and other traffic will be
carried. At Scott and Dtrvlsadero streets
brldres may also be built for the purpose
of carry'ns the driveway, footpath and
cycleway over the streets, thereby allow-
Intr 'cars and wagons engaged In moving
merchandise and other material to cross
under the drive. so that It will not be neces
sary In driving from Van Nes,s avenue to
the park to cross any car lines on the same
level or incur any risk of a collision with
vehicles or cars. The level of the drive
will be here approached by gentle slopes'
and easy roads. -
Once the land Is acquired, however. It Is
a matter for an engineer and landscape gar
dener to devise the best plan for Its Improve
ment. Winding roads may follow the pres
ent â  elevations or the twenty-six-foot cut
be made. In either event the great purposes
of the panhandle extension will be served.
Out of the thirteen blocks only three will
be affected by the cut suggested, and that
will enhance rather than diminish the effect.
Respectfully yours.. JOHN M I-AKKN.
Superintendent.

interference of friends alone pre.
trouble. Since then threats have been
breathed heavily on each side, and the,
Slmpson-Nusbaumer feud ha* Man one of
the old-time contests of the town.
It would seem now Thut Simpson has
decided to make his thmtl X""d and has
taken the case Into the court*, lie as
serts fraud and says that Nusbaumer re
l>orted to him that the material men re
fusal to make discounts on their bills
when the revt rÂ«e was. tho fart. HÂ»> then
says that Nusbaumt r went to San Fran
cisco to effÂ»-Â« t a settlement with Macdon
ouÃh. and that he went to the office of the
late K. I. Cole, Macdonoacb'i attorney,
and there made a settlement, leaving
Simpson outside. Simphon says that he
does not now know the amount for which
the settlement nil made at thut meeting,
and that Nusbaumer has never told him.
He claims that he made several engage
ments with Nusbaumer to meet him at
his office for a settlement and that Nus
baumer kept none of the engagements.
The final assertion Is made that "when
finally pressed to the wall said Nu.t
baumer informed the plaintiff that he did
not remember how much money he had
received on the said demands aginst Mac
donough." According to the complaint thÂ«Â»
only figure he could get was "some $19.
000 as tho amount received. Out of this
he received $1116 80 after paying outstand
ing claims. He now asserts that Instead
of $19,000 Nusbaumer received $21.265 40.
and that at least the balance between thut
figure and $19,000 Is due. If not more. He
also says that the various material firms
discounted their claims largely and that
he is entitled to the discount, and so he
demands the- accounting.
Mr. Nusbaumer was not in Oakland to
day and could not mak" a statement, but
George W. Reed, his law partner, did.
"There is no truth In the complaint at
all." said Mr. Reed. "Simpson s*it tangled
in his contract and the suits got so eoss>
plicated that it became evident that there
would be nothing left for Simpson, so
Judge Nnsbanmer was taken Into the
md worked a full week compromis
ing matters. He finally got something
out for Simpson after paying all claims,
and Simpson was very glÂ«d to g> â â¢
the amount that he did. He never com
plained until about a vcar ago. when xh*
two had some personal difficulty, and
since then he has claimed all the way
from $2.ViO to $4Vtt. It Is true that JudgÂ»
Nu? baumer left Simpson outside when h<Â»
went to make the settlement, hut he did
Â»hnt because he was afraid fhrÂ»t there
might be trouble. Tf It had not been for
would have got anvthlng at all. The suit
Is without any basis at all."
Kir" Kuabamner to-night declared
the Simpson suit against him baseless.
"I shall charge Simnson with perjury for
swenring thnt he did not know thÂ» terms
of that settlement. He knew all about
the terms."
NEW STREET LAW TO
BE FOREMOST TOPIC
MUNICIPALITIES CONVENTION
HAS PROGRAMME.
â¢
Out of the convention of California
municipalities which will take place in
this city this week may come some form
of a suggestion for a new street law to
be submitted by a committee to be cre
1 ated by the convention that may super
sede the Vrooman act. The convention
will be In session three days, beginning
; Wednesday afternoon and continuing
until Friday night Inclusive. The street
laws are the leading subject for discus
1 sion on the programme. Secretary Mason
of the Associated Municipalities explain
ed something of the expectations of many
who will attend as delegates at the con
vention to a Call reporter yesterday.
"There Is need for a new street law.
and this Is clearly seen by all classes of
citizens. Our convention will be made up
of associated municipalities. The basis of
the organization Is that the municipali
ties are actual members of the associa
tion. They Join by vote of the proper au
thorities and pay dues to keep up the
organization. The delegates are all either
city officials or- others elected by city
Councils or . Boards of Trustees and so
are officially present. The Vrooman act
nan become practically inoperative. What
shall be done to relieve the situation?
Can any one determine better the needs
of the municipalities In the matter of
street work and improvements than
these very office-holders, who are contin
ually in touch with that class of prob
lems? I anticipate that one outcome of
the convention will be the appointment
of a committee of officers of municipali
ties to make a draft of a bill to be sub
mitted to the Legislature whenever It
shall convene for consideration. The
officers on. the committee ought to be
able to draft a law that will not be in
favor of the street contractors or In fa
vor of any one but the public."
The programme of the convention ha*
been extended. The following topics. In
addition to others previously announced,
will be discussed: "Municipal Licenses,"
by C. M. .Kirkbrlde of San Mate... "Elec
trical Terms," by Professor L. I* Corey
of the University of California; "The
Value of Municipal Libraries," by Fred
erick Taggart of the Mechanics' Library;
"Sanitary Regulations," by It. Clinton
Lubbock of Alameda; "Municipal Engi
neering." by Professor Frank Soule of
the University of California.

JUNIOR'S FARCE
WAS A DISTINCT
ARTISTIC PLAY
Great Gathering at This
Annual Event.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway. Dec *
From half-past 1 to 2 o'clock this after
noon several hundred students, accom
panted by relatives or friend*, passed I y
little groups Into the Macdonough Theater,
where a. cluster of ushers awaited them.
Every one went In smilingly expectant.
At 6 o'clock those hundreds streamed out.
satisfied and beaming. The farce, had be a
goodâ splendidâ a triumph. And the cur
â  tain raiser no lens commendable.
"It began at the beginning." For the
orchestra, with cunning art. won the le
gions as I hey were directed to their seats
or trod each other's toes on the "stand-
Ing room." by playing tunes dear to col
lege hearts. And from the time il.it
"Palms of Victory" Moated out from tnÂ»Â»
footlights to rebound where verdant
freshman or stately senior mingled In tho
gallery regions of the gods, to that clos-
Ing moment when a falling curtain meant
palms of victory for the playwright of the
day. Richard W. Tully and Milton
Schwartz, there was Fun with a capital.
The audience was the typical audience
that a Junior farce Invites. The president
and his wife and an attending faculty
member In one box. distinguished mem
bers of the press and a pretty girl or
two In another; a third box with faculty
ladies as appreciative as thejolllest Junior;
other boxes lined and rimmed with girl*
in bewitching frocks and hats that at
tracted Â«he ever-moving opera glasses:
the orchestra and dress circles a sea of
faces, with a foyer background of men
and maids that extended to the boxes
again; the balcony as bright as the pit;
the gallery ultra for once.
The opening numbers were- an Introduc
tion to Laurence L. Greene, president of
the Junior class, who modestly but in I
pleasant fashion spoke for ten minutes on
his class.
The curtain raiser followed and carried
In Its cast Its author, Milton 11. Schwartz,
who proved himself not only a clever Im
: personator, but an equally clever writer.
1 From beginning to end the skit was â 
I round of fun. all hinging on the compli
cations of the arrival of a football coach
; and a coachman at once and the sam*
â  time at a suburban home In the college
town of Berkeley. Henry Clinton Melon*
as Francis Nautlce. an English architect,
was first to be mixed up. John \V*. 8.
, Butler, who was Barrett Henran, the real
; coach from Princeton, was tangled next,
and then the coachman, Thomas Thomp
son, who on the Junior rolls Is Elmer M.
Harris. Mr. Schwartz sustained the role
of a retired capitalist and Miss Rub-
I Morse that of his daughter, a profound
admirer of football men.
Then came the farce, which, while local
â  was not so much so as to debar it from*
other audiences, and certainly In every
wayâ characters, lines, situations and
| complicationsâ lt was distinctly above the
line of farces.
It would be difficult to nay to whom the
honors, histrionically, belonged, for from
Mr. Southard to Miss God in the acttn â¢Â»
: was exceptionally good. Mr D. A. Oor
denker as the "good, honest. intelligent
( Japanese schoolboy" who tries at th*
, .name time to be a house servant, created
a part that should live. Rea Hanna wui
loyal and ApoUo-llke enough to win
other hearts thnn Ruth Thornton's. Mr
Schwartz, who had a role in the farce,
too. was a rushed "prof." without ;i
flaw. Ralph Fisher. John Butler and
Charles Cobb each deserve encomiums
The young ladles In the play wurp well
cast. Miss EIIaTFaUIanI sustained the In
: genue and was the daintiest of apple
cheeked girls Miss Isabella Godln won
praise for stately coyness. But special
commendation should be given Ml-..-*
Holmes ("Mrs. Wlgglnton Wiggins") an. l
Mis.-< Bohall. "the daughter" of hÂ»r
I father." Miss Holmes was free from the
' faults of stage novices. Miss Bohall in
troduced a gown worthy of Mary Van
Buren and displayed a beautiful voice in
a song prettily Introduced.
Mr. Tully. who held the title role,
! "James Wobborta. I. S. 8. Boston," de
serves a paragraph, and won the theater
from the start.
Flowers galore poured over the foot
lights at sundry and appropriate time*
during the afternoon. And. indeed, then*
seemed to have been nothing forgotten
or missing, and the assembly waj
devoid of disappointment.

NEWS OF FRATERNAL ORDERS.
Eastern Star.
There axe but few persons any of whom
Is entitled to credit for devotion to the
order of thÂ« Eastern Star and Its prin
ciples In .1 greater degree than Is Mrs.
Maria Akcrs Pierce, wife of William
Frank Pierce of Oakland, a gentleman
who stands very high In thÂ« Masonic or
der. Mrs. Pierce, as a plain every-day
member of Oak Leaf Chapter No. 8, was
a most earnest worker and to her Influ
ence is due much of the success of that
chapter. As an officer, whatever station
she filled, she performed her duties with
a conscientiousness that won for her the
highest admiration of all. But in her
capacity of worthy grand matron of the
State of California she demonstrated
what devotion to an order Is and what
one woman can do when she takes an
Interest In a work which haÂ« for its
chief aim the glorification of her sex and
the placing of woman on the highest
plane, to say nothing of the maintaining
of fraternal love ana of unostentatiously
extending relief to those who are in need,
as does This order. In that capacity she
gH.\-o her time, her energy, at no small
sacrifice of home comforts and personal
convenience, and her intelligence, as she
Ik a remarkably Intelligent woman, to
the end that the order of the Eastern
Star, .if which she i- a most ardent ad
vocate, should become the leader of all
organizations in which women are a
component part and which have frater
nity fur the foundation Btono. By voice
ana action --he did all that any one could
do to exemplify the true meaning of
fraternity and she did it in so affable a
manner that wherever she went she won
every one over to her way of thinking.
During her term she visited seventy
three Of the chapters and established a
large number of schools of instruction
for the purpose of having the beautiful
work of the order performed with uni
formity in every chapter room. She held
twenty-four of these schools during her
term as grand matron and was the In
structor in each. Only those who fully
understand what such instruction means
as to the time and the watchfulness of the
Instructor to nee that every point is faith
fully brought out can appreciate the
amount of work she did. It must be ,-.
gratification to her to know that her work
was appreciated and that she is looked
upon everywhere as one of the grandest
and mod amiable women who ever devot
ed herself to the advancement of the or
der of the Eastern Star in California.

POULTRY SHOW
CLOSES AFTER
GREAT SUCCESS
Most Successful That
Has Been Held.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadwuy. Dec. 9.
The annual show of the Oakland Poul
try Association, the California Collie Club
and the Pacific Pigeon Club came tt. ;i
dose in the Exposition building to-night,
after a most successful season, extending
over the greater part of the present week.
The attendance both afternoon and
evening of each day tilled the walks Ite
tween fowls and animals OB exhibition,
and among the visitors were many people
from all parts of the Pacific Coast. The
receipts have been most gratifying, ami
bo far a.s the Oakland Poultry ABsociation
is concerned will be expended in advanc
ing the purposes of the association. The
next show of this association, as also of
the Pacific Pigeon Club of Akimeda, will
be held in the bum place during the tirst
week la January, li*ol. This year the club
endeavored to make a showing of ItM
birds, and placed 1100 on exhibition. Next
yeur it will aim at placing 2WU before thY
public.
As foreshadowed in this paper yester
day, Mrs. E. B. Thompson of Irvington.
In this county, secured the silver loving
cup which was the lirst prize for the best
kennel of St. Bernards. Her dogs also
tt.ok six individual prizesâ a prize for
ev* ry entry.
Poundmaster Swift of Oakland made an
exhibit of cunlnes which "had been quar
tered in his abode of errant dogs, for the
purpose of showing that they could look
sl^ek and fat even though confined in a
pound. In this respect they were su<-< ess-
I'ul. but they failed to convince any vis
itor that they were dogs of high degree.
In the exhibit of the Pacific Pigeon Club
Dr. T. L. Carpenter of Alameda, himself
un exhibitor, declared that he Intended
to protest against the listing of some of
the birds. He instanced the HUM <>f two
COCks, which he declared were entered U
hens, and In one of these cases the bird
was awarded ilrst prize. This was the
bird In coop 1(6. which was listed as a
"runt cnecquer hen," when the entry wits
of the male gentler.
Another Instance was that of the occu
pant <jf coop '.<\ which was styletl a "sil
vert runt hen," when he was in reality a
cock.
The doctor Intimated that there were
other irregularities and he proposed to
have things done differently the next time
the club gave a show.

Western Football Champion
ship Goes to ihe Chicago
Eleven.
Chicago 17, Wisconsin 0.
MADISON, wis.. Dec '.'.âThe Western
football championship g<>es t<> Chicago.
Before at leaal i-.'Â»"Â» spectators the eleven
Of the fni\ irsity of Chicago t<Â»-<lay de
feated the University ol Wisconsin lean
by a score of IT to 0 in a game that for
desperate playing, for dean, scientific
football, probably never l juaied
on a Western gridiron. It was a game
between v team which in offensive play
ing was perfect, with weather and wind
in its favor, and an eleven whose defen
sive play up to tO*day had been compact
enough to protect its line from all oppos
ing elevens except rale. But Chicago 1 *
m.i^s playt were Irresistible, and though
the Badgers fought until they ooold Bght
no m'iri' the Maroons several times
plunged through Wisconsin's line until
the ball was canted over the coal line.
only once did Wisconsin have a chance
to score, and that one chance they wure
unable to avail themselves of. as with the
ball on their own 15-yard line the Chicago
forwards braced .*-â¢) effectively that on
four downs the ball was only shoved for
ward three yards, in this respect the Chi
cago players surprised their supporters.
Their defensive play was far stronger
than expected, and even when Wisconsin
had the ball, which Wai seldom, ODea
was compelled to kick in most instances.
Throughout the whole game the Badgers
were on the defensive, most of the time
with the ball well into their territory.
Chicago quickly located the weak spots
in the . Badger* defense. They were
mostly on the left side of the line, and In
the tirst half Slaker, Fell, Hammill and
Henry, behind interference that was ap
parently unbreakable, tore through the
tackle and guard positions for gains that'
almost Invariably netted the distance.
On the right side, however, most diffi
culty was experienced. CurtlSS, the Wis
consin right tackle, played a whirlwind
game and tore through Fell time and
again in time to spoil the play, lie was
easily the star of the Wisconsin eleven.
The whirling mass-on tackle, the most
effective play of the Chicago*, was often
directed against him, but it never netted
more than three yards, and frequently
Curtlss Stopped the play before It was
fairly started.
With the other side of the line it came
easier. Flannlgan. Webb and Eldrldge
held their men safe, and when Slaker or
Fell were sent against the line the ball
generally found a resting place several
yards in advance of where it started. In
the second half Comstock. exhausted and
limping, retired in favor of Leerum. and
little Trati also went out, Wilmarth tak
ing his place. But it made little differ
ence. The game had already been won,
and although Leerum made big Flannl
gan'S life a burden to him for the balance
of the game the rest of the team was too
exhausted to make effective headway.
During the latter part of the second half
Chicago played to keep Wisconsin from
scoring, and once Kennedy adopted the
tactics of Captain McÃrldge of Yale and
dropped back twenty yards to hold the
ball. Chicago's Interference was far su
perior to Wisconsin's, and to this fact
more than any other mum be ascribed the
victory. '
Two hours before the game a cold, driz
zling rain began to fall, and throughout
the battle showers fell frequently. The
rain did not have much effect on the
field, but it was sufficiently heavy to ren
der the ball wet and slippery and fumbles
by both sides were frequent.
When the referee's whistle was blown
for the end of the game nearly a thou
sand cheering rooters broke out on the
gridiron, hoisted the tired but happy
champions to their shoulders and headed
by a band marched out of the grounds
and far up the street before they allowed
their burdens to climb into the waiting
carriages.

The play of the grate firelight upon his

There was a deep, thick silence for a

The man turned on hln heel. As he

he flung back over his shoulder:

SHOT THROUGH
THE NECK BY
MASKED MEN
E.D.Vincent Is "Held
Up."
OAKLAND. Doc. 9.â E. D. Vincent, a
butcher, employed in Fred Becker's mar
ket, at the corner of Eleventh and Wash
ington streets, was shot and severely
wounded by masked footpad* to-night.
Shortly before midnight he was walk
inn to his home. 562 Sixth street, carry
ing some $30 in silver in hi- pockets, when
he was confronted by two men. wlio
Jumped off a gate from behind .i vacant
house.
The men, who were masked, harshly or
dered Vincent to throw up his hands.
Vincent refused to comply with the order
and started to run toward his home when
one of the footpads tired a shut, the ball
taking effect in Vincent's neck. The high
waymen then ran toward West Oakland
and escaped.
The shot was heard by John Rohan and
M. K. HoUÃhton, who ran to Vincent and
carried him to the Receiving Hospital,
only a few blocks away.
Dr. Porter found that the bullet had
penetrated the left side of Vincent's neck
and lodged back of the lost tooth on the
lower jaw. The bullet was extracted and
found to be of 23 caliber. Vincent will
probably recover.
The wounded butcher himself tells the
story of the attempt to rob him of a
goodly portion of a busy day's receipts,
and adds thai his assailants were both
young fellows, who evidently knew of his
practice Of taking home part of the Sat
urday's cash.
The police scoured the neighborhood for
the robbers and will maintain the search.
AMERICANS GIVING

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.-Finding the '

troops. Agulnaldo Is trying to return to
the Tagalog belt, and the officials believe
he contemplate* escaping from the har

Otis from the northern campaign.

of Bolacan is to prevent the Junction of
1000 men under the command of General
Pio del Pllar and Agulnaldo. who is try

his destination, which is not far from

General I-awton's plan to destroy Gen

portion of It joins Agulnaldo he will nut i
have any organized body to give assist

follow to the southeast brings him wltn-
In the American lines, and Major Batch

River to get between the insurgent leader
and his destination.
in view of the position of the Am
troops in the vicinity of San Pal
will be Impossible for Agulnaldo with any
considerable body of mÂ«-n to go directly
south, and this fart gives support to the
theory of the department that the Insur

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, .Dec. ?.â To-day's short session |
I of the Stock Exchange was an animated one,
j due In sreat part to the continued demorallzu
! tlon among some of the Industrial stocks. The
j determined Liquidation manifest in Sugar save
, the tone to the market from the opening and
, soon ypread a contagion of weakness nil â 
j through thÂ« Induhtrtal list. Opening Â»*;%â Â« of
I 2T/KI shares ran the price down from 146 to 1444.
j compared with 14T<S. last r.lsht. The block fell
I to 142%, before the appearance of the bank
: statement and the covering movement by the I
j l*ars which followed the publication rallied the
pries to above 144. together with the whole)
i market. The heavy offerings of .-;.âº: a r brought
; out by this advance again decided the tone of
I the whole market, and broke prices throughout
I the list. The last sale of Sugar wa* at 139^.
I the lowest, at a net decline of i>VÂ». American
( Tobacco kept the leader close company, espe
cially In the late break. It sold at IPS. and on
the next and last sale at 104. a net loss of Z\i.
1 There wert wide breaches at other paints la
the list o.' sj^-cialtlet.. notably in Mctroi^litan
. Mn-et Railway, which fell an extreme i*;. The 1
, *te.-l and Iron stocks continued wÂ«-*k. but were
1 not *.. vulnerable as they had been recently.
: and they h. Id the late rally better than other ]
fj-ecialtles. The railroad Mocks were latively
j much firmer than the Industrials. The extreme
I amines reached a point In only a few of them.
The late rally brought prices of many rall
1 rÂ«>Â«ds above last nlnhl and net gains were
.-avt-J for a number of thÂ«>m. Bears had com
menced to cover before the appearance of the
. bank statement and their bojrt&C became rather
; more urK>nt after the statement, owing to the
, unexpectedly small Ic>ks in cash. The jwneral J
; conviction that the return was untrustworthy '
; a* an idea of the real condition of the banks 1
; IKÂ»IiK-d to the final yiHdln* j.rtces. The Â«iutKO
1 to the Sub-TrÂ«-a*ury ulor.e. which is a matter
I of record, has amounu-d to nearly f.1,000,1'00
. since the last return, whereas the statement
â  lt.di<-ates only $2.t7i.4i>0 alKÃether. That there
, has bÂ«-Â»-n n wholesale contraction of loans all
; Â»wk h*s b^en palpable In the stock market.
I and that actual new loans by the few banks
I holdintc the surplus reserve can have ofTsrt the
j contraction f<. lar as tÂ» Lnnc thÂ« latter down
to ICU.EOO was skeptically reparde-1 by the spec
j ulative i.ulillc. Under the belief that the vaÂ«a
rlt-s of the awr*Â«e oystrtn vl computation
clouded the rerults In the ftateraÂ«*nt the market
I c1Â«.!..M with pressure to sell In full force again.
The week has b.Â»en given over to liquidation
In the stock market and prices are lower
! throughout the list. The belief In difficulties
1 Â: ....â ! in the money market was the motiv*
j of the filing- and additional considerations
j Â«mphaslz.-d the weakn.-rs in the industrial list.
1 so that l"**eÂ« in the department ranted up to
! 10 to li points In come cases.
In railroad* most of the* losses were from h
j fraction to 4 points. It is probable that the
j tr.utiey strlnjjenoy und l.mn contraction were
th.Â« primary cause of weakness in the Indus
j trials as in the railroad*, but several Incidents
â¢ het|Â«rd to make a po>>r market for them and the
forced liquidation brought some violent de
| ciines. Monday's Supi-eme Court decision
I ncair.st the Iron pipe combination in the so
j <Â«!led AUdtrton case was given cumulative
erect by the references in the President's
! iHtFtatre of the mallcn effects of some of the
j Industrial combinations In formtnit a practical
j monojKjly of production and In advancing- i
I tirir^s. and Is a conviction that the coming
Presidential campaign will bring clamor a* alma |
the vast industrial combinations which have (
b*oome niHirHtlve in many line*.
The fact that the activity in the Iron and
hteel trade has received a check for the first
time since the "boom" was reflected in the
I H'>cks of lr<>n and steel companies. For all
1 ihene reasons lender* of money have chosen
thoee loans to call nr>t which had any of the
Industrials among the collateral with which
they wcn> secured. Tho^e who contn)llÂ«l the |
limited supply of loanable funds showed equal
discrimination against industrial stocks In mak
lne new louim. The sun>ly of mom-y In NÂ«-w
'â  York hn* mflV-rfd frnm n renewal of the intf-r-
I lot flcmand. The Sub-Treasury oiÂ«-iatlons have
i;. :..!â¢â  hravy inroad* upon the cash reyouroej,
of the l*"h> itinl the relief hy Government
bond redemption* ha* been gradually running
down until on Thursday it craned altogether.
HMs for Government l.ond* In the op^n markri
I are at a higher figure than the Government
offer* and the Government project for refund-
I Ins the national dÂ«-bt prompt* the owner* of
Government t*>nds to hold them, while the Â»â 
Istlns surplus ovÂ«t the leÂ«al reserves â ho*
by the Clearinc-houpe â¢ink? in partly Illusory.
!tÂ« fully half the mÂ»m!ifri of the association
l were down to the lepal limits last week. Even
j thot-e who hold the surplus are anxious to
j have a little mere mom to turn around an the
| new year period approaches". Provision must
j !*â¢ made for the larpe.n Interest and dividend
I disbursements on record. The Â»v,unÂ»e of the
foreign money market xhould disclose an ap
prehensive frame of mind, the most lmi>or
tunt Incident of the week l<elnir the ndvsnrf
, In the official discount rate of the Hank of
France fri>m S to 34 jÂ«Â«t cent to the highest
rate for thirteen years. The drastic contrac
tion 1-th of loans ami of note Issues by t>Â»e
French lnrtltutlon Indicates preparations for
some kind of â My and % determination to
contest the Hank ..f England's effort* to at
trait funds to that country.
The Lnodoo money market Is feeling not only
the cutting off of the usual suply of jrold from
the Trnnsvail mines, but the needii of the un
precedented artlvltv In trade that this coun
try Is dÂ«lnc War expens'-s chanjre South Af
r'f-a to a i!rain on the money market instead
â¢T belr.e the principal source of supply. The
severity of Ixindon's neÂ«-d of money over the
etid of the year yet remain* tn be developed,
but until It Is appeared any relaxation In thÂ«
1 New Tork money rate would certainly lead to
tiif-mpt withdrawal* of puld to lend in Lon
don. Speculators have, therefore, abandoned
bopM of easier money for the present and have
rnld BT'xl'i.
The bond market has movr>d In sympathy
â with *:^-kÂ« and a smaller volume of deallncs
and nvrr a narrower ranee of nr!<-eÂ«.

Associated Banks' Statement.
Â« ' â â¦
NEW YORK. Dec. 9.â The Financier -ny..:
I The statement of the New York Associated
Banks ending DeeemU-r 9 proved â  surprise In
i the moderate amount of cosh losnes for the
week. It had been figured that as a result of
I the operation* with Wie. pub-treasury and the
j Interior at leant $6.u<M,000 had been ink- from
j the reserve and that surplus holdings would
. show a heavy decline. Yet the total decrease
! In excess reserve as revealed by the figures was
only H.C71.175. Tlm actual loss In cash hold
ings was f2.C75.3<w, which was to be traced for
the most iÂ«art to one Institution. Loans fell
off JOS.O'M and d<*jK,slts nearly J1. 000,000. the de
crease iii the latter I rlnclns the reserve re
quirement* down about 11. 000.000 it will be
Feen that the statement waa affected entirely
by the lon of caeh from th banks. Whether
!).â¢â¢ tuiil condition of affairs .it the close of
the week Is portrmjred by this exhibit Is <\ iuhi
ful. The course of the money market from
nuw â .til after the opening of the new year
promlM to l>e erratic, ns preparations for dlvl
dend dlKbur*Â»-ments usually create more or less
confusion. i -it while there wa* a heavy outgo
of money to the South last week, following a
I late demand. it lÂ» worth notlnic that exchange
i at Important Interior points is rising Men-lily.
i This Is usually the case at this season, but the
, return flow of funds this way Is aa yet very
small. A maintained high rate for money,
however. must serve as an Incentive to attract
I whatever floating capital there may be lying
at different point*, while at the same time it
guards axainxt the loss of *p*<Me to Kurope, a"
! contingency that haa not been as Improbable
within the but f'Â» weeks as supposed. The
prerent demand for money, it Is needless to say.
I* unprecedented. Within three months, as
Treasury statistics show, over M0.OT0.0O) have
been added to general circulation, with no ef
! feet on ruling rates of Interest.

CHICAGO. Dec. The wheat market was I
steady at the opening, with the Initial figures ]
for May unchanged from yesterday at 70HÂ® I
"'">Â»'â â¢ Cables were steady and receipts llcht. i
but this support failed in the face of free sell
ing ajrainst weekly calls and gome profit tak- ;
ing. The Argentina newÃ was confusing by I
reason of the conflict In the reports, a private
wire declaring the weather unsettled, while
1 LtveriHiol asserted that climatic conditions were I
â  favorable and that the Argentines would have ,
I 75,000,000 buyhtls exportable surplus. A shade I
more credence was given the English advices.
May ranged from T *'ti7u\Â»c, closing J4c down at
; 6S*iÂ«J7oc.
Primary receipts for the week phowed a fall- j
Ing off of about 2.000,000 bu?hels compared with !
the previous week and about 6.000,000 bushels '
under the corresponding week last year. To- i
ward the dose the market felt some uneasiness |
over the money situation in New York. The
Inanimation of business was due largely to the
scarcity of decisive statistics and partly to the
fact that It was Saturday.
Corn was steady but very dull. May closed
a shade under yesterday nt 32 T 4fi33c.
Oats held their own In â¢-pit.- of the dullness,
but trade was quiet and the ranse was ve.rv

Mister Santa 1b boss at Hale's this week,
And a joll> old boss he is:
Every one in the store, you bet, feels meek,
For Santa, of course, knows his "biz."
"Come here, my boy, now you go and do that,"
And the boy stans oil on a run.

If Hnroness Ynshlkawa can win the
friendship of BaroneM Sannumlya she will
have a i?Â»i!do who can help her over the
stony places In court etiquette. Tho
baroness Is an English lady and the wife
of Baron Sannomlya. court chamberlain.
She has a wonderful influence at court
and 1- mistress of the numberless forms
and technical observances.
The lntrlcuclca of thÂ«Â«sÂ»\ not even thÂ«
visitor to Japan can realize. . I'.>r a visi
tor In the land fit the almond-eyed," un
less he be of ofticlal rank. may Jaunt
Japan, hear the Reishas Binjf. but- he gets
never a peep of Japanese court life, the
most uniquely ceremonious in the world.
The Japanese Invest their Emperor with
divinity, and hi? life of secluded pomp
gives him an additional halo. Mr Coombs
has written a vivid pen picture of his
presentation to the Emperor of Japan in
his capacity as American Minister. Ladles
nre never permitted to meet the Emperor.
Gentlemen of the proper ul'.lclal rank and
station are presented to the Empress, so
both .Mr nnd Mrs. Cooaoba met her Maj
esty, the Empress of Japan.
The Empress will undoubtedly be very
kind to the California girl. Baroness Yo
shlkawa, who will live In the Imperial
palace. The Empress understands a lit
tle English, but never speaks It, prefer
ring to use her Interpreters. She is very
broad-minded and philanthropic, and is
especially interested In the .Intellectual
advancement of the Japanese women.
The Empress took a personal Interest In
the Japanese women's exhibition at the
World's Fair In Chicago. She Is always
affable and charming to the ladles of thÂ«
foreign legations.
The wife is a member of the official
family, and as such Mrs. Coombs was
presented to the Empress. No other lady
can be presented. In case the Minister is
single the sister or other member of the
family cannot occupy the same position;
they have no place In the court life of
Japan
Mrs. Coombs, from her ofllcliil visits at
the palace.. hits a good Idea of what palace
life will mean for the Baroness Yoshl
kawa. "The Empress Is always kind to
foreigners'." said Mrs. Coombs. "I was
prepared " for a slight disappointment
when I was presented to her Majesty. I
had previously been told that I would tlnd
the court ladies not In their liieture.squa
kimonos but In European gowns.
"However. I was not prepared for the
out-of-date gowns of the court ladles. The
Empress herself was in a gorgeous Paris
lan robe six months behind the fashions.
A number of her ladles wore gowns im
ported twelve years ago. when the edict
was first published making European
clothes Imperative for official days. Our
clothes sit oddly on the Japanese women;
they carry them with the pltty-pat of the
kimono wall:, and look and feel painfully
ill at case.
"TheM Indies wear their Japanese eos
tiimfs at all other times arid are far more
picturesque and charming In th'-in than
In the prettiest gown thai ever came from
Worth.
"When I first went to Japan I expected
to sit on the floor nnd sip tea Ilka a
K'-i. c lia girl, !iut the polito Japanese trt- ->
to treat thÂ«- foreigner after hta otvn Â«-us
t"nv whether he will <;r no. Milk and
Fiisnr. never us"d by the natives, are. al
ways ready for the tea served to the for
eigner. It Is almo> t impossible wherein
Japan to do as the Japanese <n>. In their
over-anxiety to please you they almost
force upon you home customs.
"At the diplomatic dinners we Invari
aMy found French dishes ami European
service. The Japanese gentlemen as a
rul* speak English, 'â lit their wives can
seldom lisp more than 'yes, 1 and 'no.' I
could converse with my neiKhl>ors. but'
unfori'unate Mr. 'Coom'os would have to
Kit bbtween . twjo charming Japanese
wnn-icn nnd talk In the language of
smlics."
Mr*. Coornls'j|f> in ft,*: kmi of the
Mikado srives huf a faint Idea of what is
in s:ore for the Haroness Yosblha'wa. The
Jilet.ds of pretty Kate Gilbert wish the
Haroi:e.Â«s Voshlkawa all happiness in her
new .home. Will the Baroness Yoshlkawa
forset the California poppy for the Tokio
chrysanthemum?

childhood â a prospector for fiolden

born in Zanesville, <Â».. and tair.e with
her parents to Stockton when a little
child. She attended the public seho<-!s
at Stockton, and upon the death of her
father went to school in San FranHsco.

School at Chico when li* and began
teaching .it Itialto. in this county, in
September, ISnO. From Rial to j--":e wont
to Spadra. She has practically made
lior own way since she was 1G years old.
Her father's death left the family In
need, and Miss Hilton earned a Rood
pan of her livelihood while at the
Normal School by keeping books for a
San Francisco plumber.
She says that Â«ne has bcÂ»n inter
cFtÂ«d in mineralogy since she can re
member. She used to hear of the won
derful things that the finding of min
eral wealth does for poor people, and
all her life the history of mining camps
and the development of ledge* of
precious ores have been more enter
taining to her thnn the most skillfully
constructed romance. She used to
watch her father's experiments with
the bits of rock h<? brought home in his
saddle bags from a long prospecting
tour in the mountains, and before she
was 12 years old she had a fair idea
of what rock was worth investigation
and what was dead.
Having paved neatly all the money

to visit her bn.-ther at Phoenix Ariz..
when thÂ» summer, vacation of 1893
came. She had planned for two years
to go 4>rospectlhg in that region* and
f-he could scarcely wait to begin her
work. She says that she arrived at
Phoenix one night, and the next after

When the coolor autumnal weather
came, the young woman and her
brother and uncle prospected over the
mountains. The next winter, the
school teacher-prospector and her com
panions went to Globe. Ariz. It was
at that time the most notorious com
munity in the Territory. Hundreds of
hard characters- men who robbed,
assassinated, shot and stabbedâ had
rushed there. But that did not deter
Miss Hilton. There were but two other
men In Globe that winter. She says
she was treated with kindness and on
many occasions the courtesy shown her

months searched the mountains th<re.

saying In Prescott and did a fair busi

was liked, and the miners had coii
fldenc* in h*r statements Â«f the vaJues
of ores.
She was to remain In Prescott, but
when spring opened her enthusiasm for
prospect ing was renewed by the news
her brother sent her that he had found
over in the Harqua Hala region the
best-looking auriferous rock In th*
whole Territory. Miss Hilton closed
her assay office and went across the
country to Harqua Hala with her uncle
and accompanied by the usual comple
ment of ja< kasses and camp outfit. Tho
Harqua Hala mining region was the

At last a, shaft was don-n twenty
feet and several other small openings
were made. Then while the uncle re
mained at the mine Miss Hilton went
forth to sell the property. Sho carried
a gripsack well filled with specimens
and ahead full of practical facts about
her mine. She went all over San Fran
cisco with a miners' directory in her
hand, seeking possible buyers, and
showing specimens from her mine A
score of times she thought she had a
prospective buyer, but there was no
sale. She was told on every side that it
was useless for any one to attempt to
sell a mine so little developed. Among
the mining people she was known as
the girl miner. From San Francisco
Miss Hilton went to Salt Lake There

TWO PROMINENT MEN SUGGEST PRACTICAL OUTLINES FOR OUR POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
PRESIDENT DANIEL COIT OIL,-
JIAX of Johns Hopkins University
is a man by study and occupation
fitted for suggesting a practical
JL outline for our Government* policy
In â .'.'â  Philippine Islands and one who has
already tÂ»ten intrusted with the settle
rr.er.t of similar matters concerning for
tipn territorial disputed.
He has mitde a life study of sociology
and political geography and of Oriental
affairs in particular, having been presi
dent of the American Oriental Society
ilnre 1593.
Graduating from Tale In 1852 he took a
I â  graduate course at Harvard, and
then traveled through Europe for some
years, paying particular attention to the
roclal. political and educational affairs of
its nations.
? Returning to the United States he occu
pied the chair of political geography at
Yale for fifteen years. in the meantime
making many valued contributions to the
world's literature on bis favorite subject,
the geographical changes of nations.
His janicular Interest In the Orient in
duced him to listen to a second call to the
presidency of the University of California,
which he received In JS72, considering that
California was the best vantage ground
for comjirÂ«-h*>nslve study of Oriental af
fairs. At that time when interest In such
things was. with most Americans, limited
to nvrc curiosity. Dr. Gllman made the
following, as it now appears, prophetic
natrmont In the course of his Inaugural
address at Berkeley:
â¢*Th<- po?sihl<Â» relation of th's univer
sity to the enlightenment of Asiatic na
tions plves a Fpedal Interest tn its work.
fnr It is obvious that California is not
only rr.-tnary, treasury and i.:art for the
Arr.rriran States, but it Is the portal
through which the Occident nd the Or
ient must exchange their products and
their thoughts. <*hlna and Japan, Aus
tralU and the islands of the sea are the
ric!g'.it/urs and customers of the Golden
Etat*. Fhnll they not also look here for
instruction in the arts and sciences and
for un <*xanin!e of a well organized and
wc-u educated community?"
That I 'resident Gllman Is considered a
*aiv authority on matters of international
t<rrltorial dlvpute is shown by the fact
tfiat In IKSC he was appointed a member

The ultimate end might be a colony
ruled from Washington, or a self-govern

State.
As to the first, which Is rightly railed

the He to our whole history. A republic
has no machinery to control alien people

such it cease* to be a republic. No man

At the rate of 5 cents a day for after

loÂ«e the habit entirely before catching up
on our Academy expense, but at any rate
It eases our consciences and afternoon tea
has now climbed Into the ranks of the
most desirable things on top of the earth,
because it is denied us.
Contrary to the rule It is fashionable to
appear very early at an Academy seance.

To say that "dominion is inevitable" is
not to say that it is wise or right, and

To the annexation of the Philippines as
territory on probation with a view to
making a future State, 1 object on the
grounds of expediency. These people are
alien and distant and their ideas, prac
tices and Interests are all diverse Iroin
ours. The white population will always
be insignificant, mainly officials and
drummers. Much of our strength as a
nation now lies In common blood and com
mon interests. Where alien blood is with
in our borders we have race problems and
race wars. The danger of the future lies
in the clashing of interests. It teems to
me unwise to add to all this problems we
know to be Insoluble. Two single ques
tions, thoae of the Spanish friars and
Chinese immigration in the Philippines,
nre enough to make us think twice before
adopting them as our own.
These objections held while we thought
that annexation could be accomplished In
peace, and that Filipino gratitude and
hero-worship would lead these peopie to
beg for admittance to our Union. As to
the theoretical questions there was room
for many differing opinions as to what
action was expedient. Since then we have
persistently done the wrong thing, or per
haps the right thing in a halting way and
imperialists, annexationlsts and "little
Americans" alike as they understand tue
facts must, In their hearts at least, admit
this. All good men must wish the
present situation brought to a speedy end.
Till this is done, discussions of ultimate
purposes in effort thrown away.
Our great mistake has lain In ignoring
the Filipinos as a factor in their own
fle6tlny. Dewey understood these people
and handled them with skill. They
respected him and accepted his word as
law. It is the unanimous testimony of
army and naval officers, imperialists as
well as others, that had Dewey retained
authority there would have been no war.
Had his methods been followed, nad the
people been treated with Justice and their

that turn a Paris autumn into spring. Our
footman was imposingly stiff and splen

proached we fell In line with n veritable
procession of superb crirrn\"es .-.11 bound
for our destination. My friend had been
right, a hackney carriage would have
been a humiliation and a disgrace.
We passed into the court through the
lines of soldiers exactly a.--, we had antici
pated, and after appeasing several guards
with a glimpse of our charmed green
tickets entered the world-renowned cham
ber of the immortals.
"How little and stuffy it Is." was the
firft remark of my fr;.-rvi. after we had
chosen our peats, "and how qneerly ar
ranged for a thing of this port, all none

double bow-knot la a good one to pursue
leaders with firmness and courtesy, wo
could have done what we pleased with
their political future. This I get from
private conversation, not from colorless
official reports.
Our first mistake was In the introduction
of militarism and In our refusal to discuss
matters with these people or give any hint
as to what our future purposes toward
them might be. At a certain period in the
history of our occupation, we broke faith
with the Filipinos, with the world and
with ourselves. Meanwhile the struggle
which this made Inevitable has "assumed
the ugly character of a race war."
It we wish to hold the Philippines we
must try, first of all. to stop this war.
I do not believe that this can be done
by force of arms unless conciliation and
redress of grievances goes along, with it.
i may be mistaken, but the history of
other Malay campaigns gives us little
promise of permanent success. A rebel
lion "pacified" by force breaks out when
the conqueror's back Is turned. Besides,
annexation without conciliation Is impos
sible. 1 believe that a couple of months
of civil rule of the people within our
lines, under minor officials of their own
choice, with strict order and absolute Jus
tice Insured by a kindly Governor, would
do more to weaken Aguinaldo's power
than a year of campaigning. The policy
of "relentlessly crushing" out any "nig
ger Insurrection" and of putting off civil
rule, correction of abuses and reform of
taxation, till this is done is one Important
reason why "Insurrection" exists. For
purposes such as these warship* are far
more effective than soldiers. There are
no "glory hunting" officers, the men are
better discipline*! and are better re
strained. Especially they are kept out of
the streets at night.
If It is ever wise to admit or annex the
Philippines, It Is essential to our own in
tegrity that they must enter the Union
as a free commonwealth and the free
united States must accept or reject.
It Is mere childishness to say that we
have already annexed the Philippines,
that we could not help doing It, and that
we cannot help going on with the war.
If the great republic is so poor In re
sources, let us pray that she may be kept
out of all international affairs.
it Is not true that the treaty of Paris
made the Philippines "as much a part

However badl* the Filipinos may handle
ii: r cwn affairs, they can do it better
than we have done thus far, and better
than any outside nation Ii likely to do it.
The onlj way we can really hÂ«ip then is
to imiil the peace around them and over
them while they try for themselves. In
any case no region is part of the I'nited

What should we do to-day? We cannot

There Is no value in a plan unless be

outlive the authority of those now con
ducting it, for if they were open to other
expedients they would nave adopted
them. The people who have no power to

Still 1 shall ri.-k a suggestion in this line.
Let us stop land campala*ntag, bold our

direction not for conquest but for peace.

repeal the odious Spanish taxes still In
operation and permit the people the cork

which cannot be extirpated In a day. He
could make our actual policy, whatever
it Is, perfectly clear to every one, and
most important of all he could bring an
absolute end to the assaults, petty ex
tortions and Indignities from which the
"niggers" have continuously suffered ever
since General Merritt took command at
Manila, and which of themselves made
conflict Inevitable.
As matters are and as politics are, I
would approve the postponement for five
or ten years of the final decision as to the
relation of the Philippines to the United
States. We shall then know the Orientals

lAM not willing to speak at this time
of the circumstances which have
brought us to the present crisis. We
are face to face with momentous
problems which call for calm and ex
perienced Judgment rather than hasty
pronunclamentos. It Is easy to say. Why
does not the Government do this or that,
and why are we involved in these perplex
ities? but such questions do not solve the
problem.
My belief is that we should study the
problem of the government of distant pos
session? exactly as we should study any
other difficult problem, /irst get to facts.
That takes time. Meanwhile look up the
experience of civilized people In dealing
with those who come under their Influ
ence. See what acts hinder, what acts help
on law, order, industry, education and re
ligion.
We have four centuries of experience to
study in the work of Spain, Holland.
France and Englandâ methods of
theirs have been disastrous, what benefi
cial. If the scholars of our American uni
versities would take up ( .ie investigation
and publish their results, much light
would be thrown on the problem.

Elephants are particularly ..seful in

With th*. eiepha.'.t for the .tung!2 and

a complete transportation system for the
tropics.
While Indian elephants force English
guns to th<3 westward against Afghan
territory to prevent the opening of a Rus
sian seaport on the Arabian Sea. the Sir
dar must soon extend his operations
based on the Soudan so as to embrace all
of the Central African territory which
will be traversed by the Cairo to Cape
railway. For this work there is no arm
of the service more powerful than the
Camel Corps, and upon' them will devolve
all of the work of protecting the railroad
construction forces at the front from at
tacks by natives, which may be instigated
by fanatic Mohammedans, or by French
unwilling to see their heroic pioneering In
tropical Africa go for naught.
The origin of the Camel Corps was a
nucleus of seven companies of the Khe
dive's levies, of which two were Fella
heen and five Soudanese.
These were mere skeleton companies
and have been augmented to full
strength, and another corps, consisting
of two Fellaheen and four Soudanese
companies, has been added by the Sirdar.
All of the reconnolterlng and Hanking
from the time that the troop* disembark
at the second cataract of the Nile Is left
to these camel scouts, who are not raw
recruits but picked, both officers and
men. from line regiments of Sir Herbert
Kitchener's forces.
They have been drilled In every possible
formation that is encountered " In desert
lighting:, for It Is Sir Herbert's ambition
that they shall, become Invincible against
the native forces with which they must
contend. They have even been taught to
fire with accuracy from the backs of mov
ing camels. The beauty of this feat will
be appreciated by all who have ridden the
heaving, rolling animals or have seen
them ' walking with ; their long, lurching
strides. ' - .:
The thousands of camels In the Sirdar's
forces can live for days on the water In
their stomachs and the fat in their humps
on which the blood draws as a reserve.
Two or three hundred miles may be made
this way at the rate of seventy miles a
day without food or water, and some
times, for a single uay, 100 miles has been
made. When the camel comes to the end
of his Journey, usually at some oasis on
the edge of the desert, he does not seek
the shade in haste, but standing: In the
blazing sun chews with his hatchet-llke
teeth suoh dry palm stalks as are In con
venient reach and, refreshed with this and
a barrel or more of water, he is ready to
oontlnue bis Journey.
The camel, unlike the elephant, has nei
ther wit nor wisdom. Like most of the
animals of the desert he Is dull and mo
rose and yields his services to man rather
from stupidity man from education.
While on the desert they live on leaves
and twigs of the coarse shrubs, ends of
barren limbs and the tough, paper-like
substance of the doum palms, which seems
much like eating an umbrrlla wrapped In
newspaper.
The soldiers on camels, who are mostly
mounted infantry, take the place of our
cavalry arm In doing dispatch work, with
the additional advantage that no forage

Novel ExperimeQts on
Stilts.
Some very interesting and novel experi
ments with stilts were recently made In
France, the object being to ascertain
whether stilts could be made useful fur
military purposes. The French Postofflce
Department led the way in this direction
by furnishing stilts to the letter carriers
of the Landes, an extensive Bandy district
in the south of France. The Inhabitants
of this place have used stilts for centu
ries to travel over this country-
The pnmtofnee authorities awoke some
time ago to the fact that the delivery of
mall in the Landes would be much facili
tated if the postmen went over their
routes on stilts, and it Is the striking
â Occeaa of their Innovation which has
turned the attention of the military au
thorities to this primitive method of lo
comotion.
The Eighteenth Army Corps, stationed
In the Landes, made the experiments un
der the supervision of the moat expert
cUlt walkers of the district. The first ob
ject was to see how stilts could be made
use of in erecting a telegraph line. In this
work the Thirty-fourth Regiraenf of in
fantry and some skilled telegraph opera
tors took part. Orders were given to be-
Jln the construction of a line near Mont
e-Marsan, on the bank of the Adour. and
to continue It to a certain point, the aim
being to see how quickly communication
couia be established between two bodies
of troops. Thanks to their stilts, the op
erators and soldiers were very soon able
to flash the news that the work was done.
Under ordinary circumstances they would
have been obliged to use ladders for the
purpose of attaching the wires to trees
and houses, but stilts enebled them to do
the work not only eaually well but also
with far less loss of time.
Another curious experiment was made
In a tributary of the Adour. This river Is
deep In some places, and the captain of
an Infantry regiment, desiring to cross It
with hi* men. Instructed some of them
to put on stilts and to walk here and
their through It until they found a place
where it could be forded. The men, aided
by some native experts, went Into the
river and sounded It in various places,
with the result that they found a point at
which it could be forded with perfect ease
and safety. Returning to the bank of
the river they made a report to the cap-
taln. and very soon afterward the enttr*
regiment waa wading through the water
along the zigzag path Indicated by the
stilt walkers. The soldiers wore canvas
shoes while on the stilts and attached
their leather shoes to their knapsacks.
While they marched from one place to
another they carried the stilts on their
hacks in the form of a cross and were re
lieved of their knaps.nks. which were
placed In wagons at the rear.
So pleased were the army officers with
these experiments that they finally deter
mined to s>ee whether stilts could be BBSdi
really useful at such tini'-s as It mij;ht be
desirable to reconnolter the er
country. So they equipped tried s>
with stilts and sent them out over a pe
culiarly uninviting tract of land, which
they were to regard for the nonce as hos
tile territory. The men thorough:
plored this tract, artd the report which
they made satisfied the officers that this
method ofÂ«reconnnoltering would surely
DTOVfI useful In actual warfare
mainly for two reasonsâ first, because
men r>n stilts < an see oVer a much
extent of territory than men on foo
second, because such men can travel
easily over morasses and thickets, which
soldiers on foot could only cross after
much difficulty. If at all.
The Interest shown by the French mili
tary authorities in this matter has nat
orally given a great Impetus to the prep
arations which are being made at Area
chon for the forthcoming tournament of.
stilt walkers. Of this competition the
guiding spirit Is Dornon. who Is probably
the most famous living expert on stilts.
In March. 1881. he started to walk on,
stilts from Paris to Moscow, and great
was the excitement that be caused In
every city and town through which he
pasted. A baker by trade, he Is now
spending much of hi* time In training
competitors for the tournament and for
the stilt races which will be held In Mont
dÂ©-Man an and Bordeaux.

there would wm to be tnma justitleatlon <
for Fuch a view.
Children as renders <Â»f Ftories may be â 
divided Into two classes; thobe who aro
ready to read everything, and those who I
have tv be enticed Into reading anything.
Th*i reading child loves a book-any
book with a story In it. Good or bad.
weak Â«>r strong, old Â«Â»r new. It matters
not to Llm. He b<slns his story in the i
mornlr.g and Is not to be dragged from l
It till It Is Miishei: at night. Sometimes
you will Had him so fur gone that ha
will not hear the dinner bell if rung un
der his rinse. 'Jake away his lamp and !
ho will steal v bit of candle. This entha- i
plasm and concentration If wisely directed Â«
to worthy objects nre sources of power; <
but in many raws they become mere in
centires to* mental dissipation. Tho hasty i
reading of one book after another re- I
1-xrs the liber of thÂ« mind. It destroys <
the power of serious attention. It dimln- I
Ishea the ability to reflect. Many and i
many a man mppofcd to be educated is <
restless unlers his mind Is busy In va- 1
caat idleness with Komcthlng In print, no i
matter how trillir.g. In brief, this Indis
criminate habit of reading may very
easily become a mere debauch of the
mind. The Injudicious encouragement of
reading as rending makes this pernicious
vice appear like a virtue; and parents,
teachers, the public library, combine 'â¢'
support It. What a reading child actually
needs Is restriction. control and direction,
not support in his excesses.
The child who dors not naturally In
Â«"4UwÂ» - la read much lias the way made
easy for him by the nature of the books
offered him. Reading which produces a
mild exhilaration without taxing either
the intellect or the emotions affords . a
gÂ«>nt!Â«Â» amusement which may even for
an active child occasionally take the plate
of play. The nÂ«>ti<.n Is thut reading Is a
Rood thing in Itself, and that the. read-
Ir.K <'f second rate books may in time
educate the tnsto up to tlrst-ratc one?.
The truth is. only the Intelligent reading
of good hooks is praiseworthy or heneri
clnl. and scon-l-rate books only estab
Â«.sh th<? character of thr.se who read
them on a second-rate level. If a "child
can like no books above the rank of the
ordinary child's book, he had better be at
play or at work than be nailing.
The conclusion of the whole matter is
that current children's books with few
exceptions arc injurious to all classes of
roninrul readers. They lead to careless

Children should have few books; they
should read their books over and over
the lio,,ks they have should be such as
they c; tn greatly enjoy; and their read
ing should store their minds with beauti
ful, interesting and liberalizing memories.

made In child-like ages, and books in
which some great soul has expressed

A book that has appeared in part, in

lieutenant in the British army. Tho wri
ter has for his object the representation
of the life of v solulrr from tho time of
his enlistment as a private, throughout
the whole period of his service. In this
connection; It Is Interesting to notice that
the book is dedicated to Rudyard Kip
line an "the friend of soldiers." The short
e*.Â«ays on all sorts of topics connected
with a soldier* life are clearly ami
strongly, if not elegantly, written. Occa
sionally there Is a slight laxity In the
Mructuro of sentences, or a trlfllnjf de
parture from grammatical rules, but these
shortcomings may readli" be overlooked
In the writings of a practical man. whose
whole object Is to present his farts in tho
most forcible way. In his treatment of
various phases of life in the army, one Is
often Inclined to ask whether ho is Just,
or whether he exaggerates the hardships
a soldier has to endure, both in and out
Of barracks.

CHAPTER XVI.
That was a wild day in Manila. Far
o\Â«r near the Bscblta somebody hhot at
a vagrant dog tapping water from â  little
poo, nr.ii.-i- oik- of tlic many hvdranis. The
Ko.oljr policp essayed nn arrest; tho cul
prit broke and ran; the guard fired; a lot
of coolU-s. taking alarm, tied jabbering to
the river Fide. ThÂ» natives, looking for
trouble any moment, rushed to their
iiomr-s. home soldiers on pass and un
armed tumbled over the tables and chairs
in the Alhambra in their dash for tho
open street. A. stampeded sergeant told
a bugler to bound to ami, and In the
twinkling of an eye the call was taken up
from barrack to barrack, and the news
went nulling out by wire to the extreme
front, v. The shopkeepers hastily put up
their shutters and bolted their door*.
O*bÂ», carts aiâ caramattas â even
the street carsâ were Instantly seized by
the soldiery scattered all over town and
utilized to take them tearing back to Join
their regiments. In five minutes the busi
ness streets downtown were deserted. Chi
nese cowered within their crowded huts.
The natives, men and women, either hid
within the shelter of their homes or fled
to the sanctuary of the many churches
Ail over the great city the alarm spread
like wildfire. The battalions formed un
der arms, those nearest the outer lines
being marched at once to their positions
In support. those nearer the walled city
waiting for orders.
Foreign residents took matters more
coolly than did thÂ« Asiatic; German
phlegm, English lmpasslveness and Yan
kee devil-may-carlshneas preventing a
panic. But those who had families and
owned or could hire carriages and
launches were not slow In seeking for
their households the refuge of the fleet
of transports lying placidly at anchor In
the bay, where Dewey's bluejackets shift
ed their quids, went coolly to their sta
tions and, grouped' about their guns,
quietly awaiting turther developments. In
an agony of fear Colonel Frost had bid
den his driver to lash the ponies to a
gallon and go like the wind to Malate;
but trie appearance of the long ranks of
sturdy Infantry resting on their arms and
beginning to look bored, measurably re
assured him before he reached his home.
Once there, however, the sight of Nita.
clinging hysterically to her sister and
moaning on her bed was sufficient to de
termine his first move, which was to wire
for his launch to come around to the bay
shore and take them off to the fleet. The
next was to send and ask for an officer
and twenty men from the cuartel. on re
ceivinrr which message the major com
manding, standing on the dusty roadway
in front of his men, grinned under his
prizzled mustache and said. "Frost's got
em again, Here. Gray, you go over and
tell him to keep his hair on. that it's
nothing but a fake alarm." And Gray
glad enough of the chance to go again
Into the presence of the woman who so
fascinated him. sped on hi* mission. Ho
was In a fury over his recent humiliation
in her very sight he. a commissioned of
ficer, tossed aside. IlkÂ© a child and out
witted by this daring Intruder In th
shape of a private soldierâ and his
guard brushed away and derided by a
young fellow in some strange regimentâ
who had easily escaped along the beach
to an adjoining lnclosure Into which he
darted and was no more seen.
The streets were full of scurrying sol
dierÃ. and it was the simplest "thin* In
the world for him to mingle with them
and make Mb way to his own command.
Of course. Gray well
knew who the man
must be â Nlta's
troublesome lover of
whom Wltchle had
told him so much.
There was his chance
to recover the let
ters Rnd claim the
reward; but man and
letters both had es
caped his grasp; and
when he pulled up. blown and exhausted
after fruitless chase, he was brought to
his senses by the sight of his own men
falling in "for business," and he had to
scamper for his sword and Join them.
That was a miserable evening. Marga
ret Garrison was the only member of the
household who seemed to have her wits
about her and her nerves under control,
for Frank, her liege lord, had his duty
elsewhere, and nut until hours later
trotted slowly home. Margaret plainly
let Gray understand how he had fallen
In her estimation at being so easily tossed
aside. A warning finger was laid upon
her lip. "Not one word of what, has hap
pened while he Is here," she muttered:
and a nod of her fluffy head toward the
perturbed colonel told plainly that the
chief of the household really had no place
in the family councils. To thÂ« sisters
that alarm was a blessing In disguise. It
was all _:'.)â ;â¢;. i to account for Nltn's
prostration. To the rash and reckless
lad who, claiming to be an orderly with
a lett from the colonel, hud passed by

Long will Manila remember the night!
It followed close upon the heels of warn

the strain increased. The insurgents,

fronted by thickets of bamboo that fairly
â¢warmed with Insurgents, yet only by the
Incessant zip and "whiew" of their deadly

fire could this be determined: for with
their smokeless powder and their Indian

be seen of their array. Over to the west

huge Monndnook was driving shell after

abandoned rice fields and the' marshy fiats
that lined the shore. Over to the east
resounding cheers and crashing volleys,
punctuated by the sharp report of field
guns, told that the comrade brigade was
heavily engaged and apparently driving
the enemy before them. To right and
left their volunteer Bupports were bans-
Ing into the brush with their heavy,
Sprlngflelds: and etlll there seemed no
symptom of weakness along the immedi

thing the fury of the insurgent volleying
Increased as the sun climbed higher, and
all along the blue-shlrted line men gritted
their teeth and swore as they crouched
or lay full length along the roadside, peer-
Ing through the filmy veil that drifted
slowly across their frontâ the smoke from
the Springfield! of the volunteers. To lie
there longer with the bullets buzzing
close overhead or biting deep Into the low
embankment, sometimes tearing a sting
ing path through human flesh and bone,
was adding to the nerve strain of the
hours gone by. To rush headlong across
that Intervening open space, through deep
and muddy pools an<l stagnant ditch, and
hurl themselves upon the lurking enemy
In the bamboo conso beyond. had been the
ardent longing of the line since daylight
carno to Illumine the field before them.
Y. stern orders withheld: Defend, but
do not advance, said the general's mes
sage; and the whisper went along from
man to man. "There Is trouble In town
behind us, and the chief may need us
there."
But as R o'clork passed with no word Â«>f
uprising in the rrnr, and the cheering
over toward Bantu Ana grow loud md

became wellnlgh Intolerable. "For God'

more than one company along the Im
patient line; and the gruff voices of vet

silence, while, moving up and down be

against waste of ammunition and .ieed
less exposure. "Lie Hat, nvn. Keep

And presently It came. The cheering
that had died away, far over to the !â  :t

ed Slngalon and Blockhouse 12, was sud
fl( nlv taken Dp nearer at hand. Then
crashing vollr\s sounded along the nar

rang out shrill and clear above the noise
of battle; and then closer still, though
unseen* In tho gloom of the dense thicket
in whlrh they lay. the men of the Sec

trail that led away to the rice fields,
swung their big straw hats and yel>d
for Joy. A young officer, his eyeÂ« flash-
Ing, his face flushing with excitement,
came bounding out from the grove at the
left to the crouching line and made
straight to where the veteran battalion
commander knelt in rear of his center
It was Billy Gray, adjutant of the Third
Battalion, acting that day as adjutant to
the regimental commander. TJie bullets
whistled by his head as he darted spring-
lngly along; and In their Joy at eight of
him even old hands forgot the reserve - f

bhouted: "Now we're off!" and the popu

hair at the top of his head and almos
scoring the scalp. To save his soul lie
could not quite suppress the trembling of
his knees: but. steadying himself by
great effort, he. continued: "The colonel

moment our bugles sound the charge
Now I must get back." . .
"All right, youngster. Tell the colonel
I savoy, and we'll do our level bestâ only,
let us Into It as quick as you can."
But Gray heard only the first part of the
sentence. He. was panting when he
reached his placid, gray-mustached chief
and could only gasp out: "The captain
understands, sir." And then the regi
mental commander simply turned to the
battalion leader, standing silent at his
left in a little clump of timberâ another
veteran grown gray as himself In lons,
lonjr years of senvfee:
"Now's our time, old man. Pitch In.
Gray, we'll go with him."
All along the line from right to left
there ran the cross-country road connect
ing the broader highway, from Malate
to San Rafael and Parana on the west
and from West Paco by way of Slngalon
to Pasay. In front of the right wing all
was swamp, morass or rice fields. In
front of the left wing all was close, dense
bamboo and Jungle, save where the broad,
straight roadway led on past Blockhouse

southward, overarched in places by
spreading branches, and commanded Â«v

the blueshirts stormed these, forssjl
strongholds front th and took them
from the iruopd of Spain. N<>ss tlu-y were
compelled to turn and storm then from
the north: for. just as Stanley Xrtr.^tp.nÃ
said at San Francisco, 'ho Enllplnoa had
turned upon their ally an<l would-be
friend. Agulnaldo had boarded
Bam.
And while the volunteers and regulars
to the right could only remain in sup
port, it fell to the lot of the left wins
of thin brave brigade to assault In almost
Impenetrable position an enemy armed
with magazine rifles or breech loaders and
entirely at home. The bugles rang the
signal; the officers In silence took their
stations, and stepping into the narrow
pathways through the Jungle, crouching
along the roadways or crashing through
the stiff bamboo, the blueshirts drove
ahead. Two, three minutes, and their
purpose seemed undiscovered. Then sud
denly Blockhouse U blazed with fire and
a storm of bullets swept the road. The
earthworks In the thickets to the right
and left seemed to be crowded with a
running flame; and down on their fa^rs
fell the foremost soldiers, their gallant
lender shot through and through, plung
ing headlong, yet In his dying agony wav
ing his surviving men to get to cover.
Vengefuliy wow the "KraÃs" opened In
reply to Remington and Mauser. The
blueshlrta struggled on Inch by Inch
through the network of bamboo. Still the
storm swept up the roadway and no man
could hope to face it and live. But little
by little tho low nlmed. ste^'v volleys,
driven In by squad and section through
the ennebrake or by company and platoon
across tho westward swamps, told on the
nerve- discipline of the little brown
men in the bamboo. Their shots flew
swift, but wild and higher. Then a dar
ing lad. In the rough field uniform of a
subaltern of infantry, sprang like a cat
Into the fire-flushing lane and revolver in

his heels dashed straight nt the wooden
walls ahead. In frantic hastÂ«- the occu

And th. came the rush of comrades
cheering down the lane, tumbling over
the earthworks and the. luckless ganjj

position, and all the southward leading

But, over along the next lane, a parallel

as stern a check; and the fury of the fire
from the trenches In the thickets forced
brave men to cover and dropped others

called on others to follow. Down went

veteran sergeant, drawing the back of a

CHAPTER XVII.
In the fortnight of Incessant action that
followed the mad attack of that starlit
Sunday morning, there was no place for
Billy Gray. Sorely wounded, yet envied
by many a fellow soldier for tho glowing
words In which the brigade commander
praised his conduct and urged his brevet.
the uoy had been carried back to the
great reserve hospital at Malate. ThÂ«
breezy wards were tilled with sick or
wounded, and certain of the rooms of
the old convent once used for study and
recitation had been set apart for officers.
There were three cots in the one to which
they bore him. and two were already oc
cupied. Even In his pain and weakness
he could hardly suppress a cry or dis
may; for there, with his arm bandaged
and In fcpllnta. his face white from loss
of blood, his eyes closed In the Bleep of
utter exhaustion, la) Stanley Armstrong.
Time and again the boy's heart at. con
science had rebuked him for the estrange
ment, that had arisen between him und
this man who had proved his best friend.
Time and again he had promised himself
that he would strive to win bacÂ»c that
friendship; but well he knew that tlrst
he must reinstate himself In Armstrong's
respect; and how could he hope for that
so lour as he surrendered to the fascina
lions that kept litm dangling about tha
dainty isKlrts of Wltchte Garrison? . .
Oddly enough the boy ha<l hardly both
ered his hea.i with any thought of what
Frank Garrison might thli.k of his atten
tions or devotions, whatever they could
be called, to this very captivating und
capricious helpmate. When a husband is
so overwhelmed with other cares or con
siderations that he never sees his wifo
from morn till night, society aeems cor
respondingly to lode sight ot him. Down
in the depths of his bcart the boy was
ashamed of hlm*t-lf. . He never heard
Arms) mentioned that he did not
wince, lie knew arid *hÂ«- Ur.ew that, com
ing suddenly upon Hum as Armstrong
had that tropic night on the Queen, ho
must have heard her words*, must hava
realized that some compact or under
standing existed betweeen them which
neither Gray nor Mrs. Frank could pal
liate or explain. It had not needed ihat
episode to tell her that Armstrong held
her in contempt; und yet. when they
chanced to meet, she could smil* 1 up Into
his eyes as beamingly, as guilelessly, as
though no shadow Â»t sin had ever dark
ened her winsome face. But not kj Gray.
He moaned In secret over the loss of a
strong man's confidence and esteem. Ho
longed to find n way to win it hack. Ho
had even thought to co to the colonel with
his trouble. makÂ»- a clean breast of It. tell
him the truthâ thai !Â»â¢â¢ bad fallen deeply,
as it was i â¢â¢ - 1 1 â¢ 1 - for him to fall. In lovo
with Amy Lawrence: hud hoped his love
was returned; had found It was notâ that
she had only a frank, friendly, kindly in
terest In him; und that, wounded and
stung, he had fretted himself into a fever
at Honolulu, aided by Canker's asper
sions, and thenâ wellâ any man is liable,
eald Billy to himself, to j;ct smitten with
a woman who tenderly and skillfully
nurses him day aftvr day: and that's Just
what Witchie. Garrison did. But somehow
the opportunity to tell him never seemed
to com*: and now that Armstrong;
and himself were thus thrown together
with the prospect of being In the ?amÂ»
room day and night for the best of tho
month, a third olllcer. a stranger, lay
there, too. and in hU presence or hearing
any confidences would be Impossible even
If Armstrong encouraged them, which ho
probably would not. In this embarrass
ment Billy "a wish was that the colonel
were fifty mil* away. Tt was fate and a
hard one. thought he. that brought him
tli* reâ an ever-present reproach. It was
luck of the worst kind that they should
be confronted under Mich circumstance*,
since neither could retreat He submitted
in anxious silence to the keen, quick ex
amination of the skillful surgeon In
charge and tn the redressing of his wound.
If.- could have been proud and n.ippv
but for that shadow on his life, of which
Armstrong's presence would so constantly
remind him. He could not even think how
his dear old dragoon daddy would rejoice
In the congratulations that would surely
preet him when the story of the brave
dash of the â irenth. Hilly among th*
foremost, should reach the States. Ha
1 could not even dream how It would affect
herâ Amy Lawrence. He was beginning
to be ashamed now In this presence to
think how that otherâ how Margaret
Garrison might be Impressed, fonjettln*
that, to the army tr:rl who ha* lived long
years on the frontier, tales or heroUm are
the rule, not the exception. He wondered
How long it could be before she would
come to him to bring him comfort. Bur*lv
by this time she knew that he had been
furiously, painfully wounded. He did not
know, however, that at the very first
sound of battle Frost had bundled th*
sisters aboard his launch and steamed
away to the transports. Yet. what com
fort could her visit bring to him with that
stern censor lying there, peeing and hear
ing all? Billy Gray that Monday night
could almost have wished that Arm
strong's slumber might be eternal, never
dreaming that before, a second Monday
sh'-ul<l rome he would <nk heaven with
grateful heart for Armstrong's presence,
vlirllanc* and Intervention.
In three days the colonel was able to
sit up. Within the week he was per
mitted to take air and exerdsa In thÂ«
spacious court of the old college, his
p-.vord arm In Its sling. But Gray and thÂ«Â»
young officer of volunteers were too seri
ously wounded to leave their pillows.
The â teenth had occupied a new llnÂ« far

several of Billy's old officers had dropped
In to see him and tell him regimental
news, nnd one of them, the young West
Pointer who hnd broken down at slcht of
the dying face that stirrin* Sunday
morning, told him of Latrohn'ti soldier

ence and speechless prlef;.nnd Billy's

and the comfort of your husband, learn
to cook.
Let me tell you something funny. The

at it more from a selfish standpoint than
from a practical one.

FOOD FROM A
SCIENTIFIC
STANDPOINT.
â [jâ-31)00j â -31)00 constitutes the chief Item of
â 1 the living expenses of the people,
of our agricultural production and
of our export- Half of the earn
ings of the wageworkera in this country
and in Europe is spent for foods. The

health and strength <>f all are Intimately
dependent upon their diet. Yet mo:-'
pie unÂ»l. rstarxi wry little about what
their food contain.*, how It nourishes
them, whether they nre economical or
wasteful in buying: and preparing It for
use and whether or not the food they eat
is rightly fitted to the demands of their
bodies. â . .
Scientific research. Interpreting the ob
nervations of practical life. implies that
several errors are common In the use oJ
foods.
First, many people purchase needlessly
expensive kinds or roods, dolnjr this und-r
the false Impression that there I?
peculiar virtue In the costlier material.,
and that economy in our dlot is soirehow
detrimental to our diKnlty or our welfare.
And. unfortunately, those who ure most
extravagant in this respect are often the
ones who can least afford it.
Secondly, the food which we cat does
not always contain the proper proportions
of the different kinds of nutritive ingre
dients. We consume relatively too much
of the fuel or heat producing foods, such
as the fats of meat and butter, the starch
which makes up the larger part of the
nutritive material of flour and potatoes,
and sugar and sweetmeats. Conversely
we have too little of the protein of flesh
forminK Ingredients, such as I, an of meat
and fish and the gluten of wheat, which
make muscle and sinew and which are
the basis of blood, bone and brnln.
Thirdly, many people, not only well-to
do but those In moderate circumstances
use needless quantities of food. Part of
the excess, however. Is simply thrown
away with the wastes of the table and
kitchen: so that the Injury to health,
great as If may be. Is doubtless much
less than 19 Â«il were eaten. Probably the
worst sufferers frÂ«m this evil are fhÂ«
well-to-do people, of sedentary occupa
tionsâbrain workers as distinguished
from hand workers.
Finally we are guilty of serious errors'
In our cooking. We wast* a great deal of
fuel in the preparation of our food, and
even then a great deal of the food la
badly cooked. A reform In these methods
of cooking Is one of the economic de-r
mandn of the day.
We cannot Judge of the nutritive vahi*J
of food by the quantity. This fact may rwÂ»
clearly nhown by analysis of the various
foods. There Is as much nutriment In %
pound of wheat flour as In three and one
half quarts of oysters, weighing Bevmt
pounds. There Is still less connection be->
tween nutritive value and price. In buy-*
in* at ordinary marker rates wÂ« |tet a*
much material to build up our bodies, re
pair tbclr wastes and give strength for
work In 5 cents' worth of flour or beans
as 50 cents or SI will pay for In tenderlola
or lobsters.
Round steak at 10 cents per pound M
just as (11,, vtibi.Â» and Is fully as nutrl
tlous v tenderloin at RO cents. Twenty
five cents Invested In a pint of oysters win
yield about on** ounce of protein and 230
heat units of energy. The same 25 cents
Invested In flour would produce, ten ounces
of protein and 13."tÂ»J heat units of energy.
The question as to how much nutriment
persons of different age, sex and occupa
tion need, and the beÂ«*t foods to rive thÂ»
desired quantity, has been the subject of,
considerable research. Various standards
have been proposed by physiologists and
chemists tor the dally dietaries for per
sons of different age, sex and occupation.
They are usually estimated In terms of,
the three classes of nutritive Ingredients,
protein, fats and carbohydrates. A stand
ard for a ration or a dietary may bÂ«
bused upon cither:
First, the observed Tacts of consump
tion.
Second, the actual need and available
or most economical supply. Standards
estimated on this basis would take Into
account not only the actual demands of
the body for nourishment, but also thÂ»
kinds of food that are to he had and thÂ»
cost of the nutrients In various food ma
terials.
Third, the physiological demand. Bjr
this Is meant the quantities of nutrlenti
which are most appropriate for the par
ticular Individual or class. Standards es
timated upon the first basis would cor
respond to actual practice. Those upon
the second would take into account both
pecuniary and hygienic economy. ThosÂ©
of the third would consider only what
was intrinsically most titling.

to find an answer to .Â«ome of the questions
suggested In the notes:
1. By an analysis of the common foods

ir.g Club. This barge was built a year
ago at a cost of about f.VK>. The money
necessary for this purchase was borrowed
from a hank at a low rate of interest, and
the association, through monthly dues
and subscriptions from members of the
faculty, has already succeeded in raying
*KÂ«0 on the note.
Througn the generosity of the San Diego
Roy.ing Club the association was fur
nished quarters for dressing-rooms and
for housing the Pristis. and was given the
use of tho c lub's barge three days a week,
in consideration for this courtesy new
members were secured for the rowing
club.
There are r.ow seven crows â¢) the asso
ciation, six of these being composed ex
clusively of young ladles and one of yourg
men. Kach crew has its own officers,
generally a captain, a paymaster and a
zÂ»n at all. The course of his whole ca
rter, since early childhood, was changed
by one act of confidence on the elder llen
dorson's part.
For generations the Hendersons dwelt
in Old Deer, a village attached to th.
Karl of Huchan'R estate In rdeenshlrc.
Scotland. As the colonel is now. so was
his father before him. fond of singing.
and possessed of a voice which made him
a general favorite. The Id Karl of Bn
cnan. a. bachelor, who received much
company and lived high, was one of those
who took pleasure in Henderson's voice
ami often had him at the .-astle for the
diversion of bis guests. Henderson had
tho :i<i<J!tional gift of improvising rhymes
readily, and frequently composed new
songs en the spur of th- moment,
adapted them to old airs and sang them,
to th< immense cntertainmr-t.t of the
Karl's visitors. On one occasion when
Henderson's f-fforts had been particularly
pleasing, the Karl told him he might oc
cupy a good sized strip of land at the
mud of Old Deer's main street, promising
that the land should remain rent free to
three generations of his descendants. Ac
cordingly Henderson built a ro-w of six
email fetone houses. Investing virtually all
his savings in their erection, and became
a landlord and a man of substance among
his neighbors. David Brenner Henderson
the youngest of the children, was born
in one of these houses on March 14 IMo
After a heavy dinner the old Earl
dropped dead one night, and the estate
passed Into the hands of strangers who
knew not Henderson. A few days later
the dead Karl's youngor brother called
at the Henderson home and asked to see
title deeds or some other legal documents
under which the land on which the houses
Btood was held. But Henderson had no
title deede. no lease, no legal paper of any
â¢ ort whatsoever. He had never thought
to ask for anything of the sortâ the Ear)
had given permission for the occupation

of the land, bo what need was there for
papers? Then, said the young laird, the
Hendersons must get out inside of two
days. Henderson could not believe his
ears, but the laird meant exactly what he
paid. When this was made clear to him.
Henderson turned, seized the young
gentleman In his mighty grasp. carried
Mm to the door and kicked him into the
street.
In' the mind of Henderson that closed
thÂ« incident, but his clever Wife knew
better. She comprehended how serious
a matter it was for an ordinary man to
commit bodily assault on a member of
the nobility, and know that something
must be done or imprisonment might re
sult. So that night she went to the laird
without her husband's knowledge, and on
her bonded knees begged for clemency
promising a."= speedy evacuation of the
premises as possible without legal contest
of any sort. If only there should bo no
prosecution. It took a long time to move
the angered laird, hut he finally relented.
and the six weeks the Earl had given per
mission for having been sacrllircd
to the emergency, the family embarked
on the old ship Hrooksby for the United
States, where two of Mrs. Henderson's
sisters were living.-
The trip tasted many weeks. David
irenner was only El* years old then, but
op. remembered thÂ« stormy voyage as if
It all happened last week.
The Hendersons struggled slowly to
Chicago. When they reached that place
Thomas Henderson had just one British
sovereign (less than five dollars) left of
the money he had realized from the sale
Df his efTects in Scotland with which to
tegln life anew.
THB STTNDAT CALIj.
Georro Kerr, a nephew of Mrs. Hender
son, met the party at Chicago to escort
th*m farther nn their way. The young
man had brought along two covered]
wagona. In th*-rn the new comers fin
ished their travels. Wasting no time In
!<lle repinlngs, Henderson buckled manful
1\ to hi.-, task. In less than four years he
and his sturdy buys had es.al.lishetl
themselves fo well that they were able
to buy a big tract of Government land In
layette County, In the northeast ernmr.st
corner of lowa, and there they settled
and sprfad out, after genuine Amerloan
pioneer fashion. They named their new
home Pleasant Prairie, but their neigh
bors wouldn"t have it bo. They renamed it
Henderson's Prairie, and so It Is known to
(!)â¢â¢ present day.
It would be !iard to conceive of a busier
bOJT'S life than that of David B. Hender
son in the log home built by his father.
The Whole Â«-nuntry abounded with wild
and the stnarns were full of Bsfa
but the youngster had no time to hunt or

It came about In this way: When ihe
youngster wae 16 or 17 a stranger who had
heard of David's process as a wrestler
visited Henderson's Prairie for the pur
pose of trying conclusions with him. Tho
stranger was taller and heavier than his
boyish opponent, but Henderson throw
him repeatedly, the stranger finally ad
mitting that the boy was the better man.
Finally the stranger said that If he could
have what was called the "right hand
under hold" he would try again. It was
against all precedent to give an opponent
such an advantage, the left hand going
with the under anfl the right wl*.n the up

after a long struggle, the stranger got
the "trip-look," the boy was thrown, his
right wrist being dislocated and one of,

was sent to Rockford, 111., wnure another
surgeon could be consulted.
David was able to do no manual labor
for a long time, and it was while he was
thus incapacitated that serious thought
was taken of a college course. or* he
went to college, however, he taught a
term of school in his home district. â¢
That fall D. B. Henderson entered thÂ«
Upper lowa University as freshman..
There he studied for three years, working
on the farm in summers and living with
the greatest frugality In winters. He and
a chum rented quarters and kept house
for themselves, cooking their own food.
sweeping their own floors, making their
own beds.
Young Henderson pot special standing
among his fellow-students through an in
cident which had a feature suggestive of
the Incident in which his father and the
quartermaster or boatswain: also Its crew
costume of characteristic colors and Its
special day for rowing. A lively but good
natured rivalry exists between the crews
regarding excellence In discipline, epeed
and general form.
From the time the members of a crew
emerge from a dressing-room until th^
boat Is returned and safely housed they
are BUbject to the commands of the cap
tain. The boatswain attends to th-> lower-
Ing of the boat Into the water, sees that
the rudder Is shipped, the members of the
crew are properly placed and tho ptar.-i
and stripes are floated In the stern of the
barge and the crew pennant In the bow.
She then reports to the captain that "the
boat Is r>-.i'iv. sir." TliÂ»> captain then
takes her place In the stern, takes the
tiller ropes and gives the command,
"Shove her off."
The bow girl shoves the bargo clear of
the float. The captain commands "Stand
by!" and follows thin quickly by "Up
oars!" At the latter command the right
long spoon oars go up to a vertical po
sition. "Let fall:" and the oars come
down together Into the oarlocks. "Stand
by!" "Give 'way together!" and the crew
Is off, working with clocklike regularity
on a long pull to Glorletta Bay. to Ma
rine Ways, to visit some man-of-war or
other ship In the harbor, or to some other
of the numerous haunts of the crews.
There are a number of other girls' clubs
that row on the bay in barges similar
to the Prlstls. The chances are, then,
that a Normal School crew will meet the
