LONDON, July 15.â Another week
of bickering, of heated invective
and vituperation, accusations of
tyranny on one hand and treason
on the other, of increasing dis
tress among the Outlanders of the
Rand, owing to th" dislocation of busi
ness: of military preparation and
throughout all the apparent mainte
nance by the Boers of their stolid at
titude of indifference. All the repre
sentations made have only served to
add to the perils of the Transvaal situ
ation, and everything tends to confirm
the opinion that the Imperial Govern- !
ment mean's to obtain reform. The j
Ministers have practically pledged
themselves to enforce them, peaceably
If possible, otherwise forcibly. The em
pire appears absolutely united on this
subject.
The startling telegram published by
the Boer organ here, the Digger News,
on Friday, showing apparently that the
Transvaal was giving in and cordial
relations had been resumed, which was
promptly denied by the Secretary for
the Colonies. Joseph Chamberlain,
though evidently tinged to suit the sus
ceptibilities of the Doppers, was so cir
cumstantial and apparently authorita
tive that momentarily the hope was
aroused that the end of the quarrel was
in sight.
But the only foundation for the dis
patch was found in the fact that Mr.
Chamberlain on Wednesday, before the
new* franchise bill was introduced in

CITY PRISON INMATES
HATCH A BOLD PLOT
Desperate Criminals Removed to the
County Jailâ Knives and Pistols
Confiscated by the Police.
Criminal Leaders in the Attempt to Liberate City Prison Inmates.
C. .Vâ 3 HE local police authorities are
deeply agitated over what they
believe was ,a . deliberate and
I well-planned attempt to- re
â  .lease from the City Prison
some of the most desperate criminals
who have been recently arrested and
are now awaiting' trial for the offenses
of which, they are accused. Pistols and
knives, which .were smuggled into the
City Prison, have been discovered and
confiscated. One of "the ; conspirators

has been induced to expose the plot of !
his criminal associates and to* confess
the part he played in the scheme. '-
He declares that several of the trus
ties, who are serving terms of compara
tive comfort in the Clty-vPrison through j
the influence of political friends, smug
gled knives and pistols Into the prison. !
made duplicate keys of the important ,
cells and the prison door and* prepared '
to liberate several of their desperate â 
friends at the expense even of murder
ing the turnkey.
The plot was exposed by one of the j
trusties who was not consulted in the j
scheme. He learned- of the desperate |
plans of his associates and informed j
Captain Seymour. An investigation
was immediately made. The arms were :
found, two prisoners were transferred â¢
to the County Jail and a third was I
placed in the "tanks" to be questioned.
This third prisoner has confessed his
knowledge of the plot and has admit
ted his participation in the desperate
scheme. It is upon his admissions that
the, authorities base their belief of the
plot to accomplish a delivery and lib
eration of prisoners,, even at the cost i
of death. ,
The police authorities began their in- j
vestigations with well founded misgiv- !
ings that the story that the City Prison
delivery might have been the dream of j
an opium, smoker, and the. police were i
notinclined to give much attention to the
recital. When they investigated, how
ever, they revealed a startling condi
tion of affairs. They were. told to ex
amine the "bunk room" in the City
Prison. They did so and found two pis- ;
tols and several knives. They were In- j
formed that a robbery had been com
mitted in the very prison itself and the \
investigation demonstrated that the in- ;
formation was f correct.
The authorities are not eager to ad- 1
mit what they discovered, but the fact |
remains that a robbery was committed \
in the City Prison by some incarcerated i
public offender. Several nlckel-in-the
slot machines, which were seized by j
the police some days ago, (have been i
broken into and their contents stolen. \
The room in which these machines j
were stored was locked. The key' was !
placed where only the desk sergeant of |
the City Prison and the property clerk ;
of the Police Department could find it.
The room is near the desk sergeant's ;
desk and apparently is vithin the
range of his vision. But it has been
robbed and nobody seems to know
how the theft was accomplished. The !
lock of the door has neither been forced j
nor broken. The door was still locked j
when the authorities made their inves
tigation. But the nickel-in-the-slot
machines had been rifled and their con
tents stolen. '.' . '.
Armed with this corroboration of the
informer's confession, the authorities
took immediate action. On Friday
morning they examined the- "bunk
room" of the prison.* The "bunk room"
is, reserved for the accommodation of
trusties, the favored petty criminals
who. escape imprisonment in the Coun
ty Jail through the influence of a "po
litical pull." The pistols and knives
were found, but no trace of the dupli
cate Vkeys was discovered. 7: The police
claim, therefore, that no such keys
were made. . 7 V
- The authorities belie their own de
nial, however, by their actions. They
accepted the theory of their informer
and- made a raid upon the prison over
which they have: control. . They 7 have
removed from/their quarters three of ,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
' the a most desperate criminals that were
Inmates' of the City." Prison. Two of
these â¢* men' were sent to the County
Jail. They ; are -George' Graham, a
scoundrel -versatile. In many fields of
evildolng. \ and .George Abernethy, an
accomplished burglar. The third of
fender, who is given by. his associates
the evil credit of "an informer, was
locked up in the tanks. He is known
as '.'Bill" Curley. although he has half
a dozen other aliases.
He was closely questioned last night
and declared .that Graham. Abernethy
and himself planned to liberate several
of the men who are detained in the City
Prison awaiting trial for serious of
fenses. Curley said that, a trusty, who
was recently discharged, smuggled the
pistols and knives into the City Prison
and secured impressions of the main
door key and also of the keys of im
portant cells from which to make dupli
cates. These duplicate keys were made,
but the authorities have not been able
to discover them.
At a given signal. Curley confesses,
one of the trusties was to open the cell
doors and another was to look after
the turnkey, even if it were necessary
to kill him. This scheme, it was ar
gued, would have been feasible at a
moment when a trusty would take a
newly; arrested prisoner to the cell as
signed to him. 7,
The betrayal of the plot by another
trusty ended the whole affair. Aber
nethy and Graham were sent to the
County Jail and Curley is in the
tanks. Captain Seymour and Sergeant
Wolf closely questioned Curley last
night, but were unable to learn, from
him any further details of the plot.
The riding of the nickel-in-the-slot
machines will probably remain a mys
tery. The fact that the machines were
stolen cannot be denied, but for ob
vious reasons the police authorities will
not admit that any well-defined plot
was hatched to make a general exodus
from the jail. In conjunction with' this
denial the police have found it extreme
ly difficult to explain the discovery of
the pistols and the knives.

EUROPE NOT
SAFE FROM
THE PLAGUE
Such the Opinion Published
by the British Medical
Journal.
URGES PRECAUTIONS

New York Experts Say There Is No
Danger of the Soourge (jetting
a Foothold in This Country.
Special Cable to The Call an. the New. York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, July 15.â 1f any bu
bonic plague scare arises now,
the British Medical Journal will
have started it. In an article
published to-day the Journal
traces the gradual determined
spread of the plague through
India and Persia right over to
Africa, over Mauritius, Mada
gascar, Central Africa and
Lower Egypt. Though Europe
has escaped so far, it is blind
folly to imagine that it is safe.
Therefore, says the Journal,
every European country should
find money for a large medical
expedition to go into the ef
fected countries, that being the
only thing to be done, if the
plague Is to be combated at all.
NEW YORK, July 15.â New York
physicians heard with considerable in- ;
terest the statement of the British
Medical Journal that Europe is unsafe
while the plague is allowed to rage in
the affected countries. While agreeing
with the publication that too much care
cannot be taken in Europe, they ex
pressed no fear that the disease would
spread to this country. Dr. George F.
Shrady said:
"The occurrence of new cases of bu
bonic plague in Alexandria, and the ap
parent inability of the local authorities
to cope with the situation, are matters
of deep concern, as threatening a pos
sible spread of the disease to Europe.
Making due allowance for exaggeration
In the reports that the population of
-infected districts is openly opposed to
preventive and remedial measures,
there is no question that more strin
gent regulations are necessary, than
have heretofore been attempted.
"Essentially a filth disease, the spe
cific germ readily propagates Itself amid
favoring conditions of extreme poverty,
dense crowding of individuals, food pri
vation, contaminated soil and general
insalubrious surroundings. Everything
depends upon the promptness with
which the pest is attacked at its source.
"What is needed most of all is a uni
form system of quarantine, in which
all the leading powers of Europe and
Asia should take an active part."
_ Dr. Alvah H. Doty, health officer of
the port, is an authority on bubonic
plague, its germs and transmission; j He
went to Egypt- about- four > years' ago
to make a special study of this sub
. ject and of cholera in connection with
his official duties.
"I believe the statement that the
plague might visit Europe and this
country very much overdrawn," Dr.
Doty declared to-day. "The cleanli
ness of the people here, the fresh air,'
the good sewerage, the perfect sanitary
arrangements, the competent health
officials, and Intelligence of the peo
ple in co-operating with the health au
thorities, are conditions- under which
the plague could not survive. I have
not one-tenth the fear" of ' bubonic
plague as I have of ' diphtheria in this
country. About the only danger of the
plague entering.- the country is from
the Western coast,* the route from India ]
to this country being shorter across the j
Pacific. There is a" Federal, and the ;
State quarantine' at ' San . Francisco,
and there is little likelihood of any
case of plague evading the vigilance ? of
,eitherÂ»" â  *-
. Dr. Cyrus Edson, a recognized au
thority on . contagious diseases, >is â¢ also j
of the opinion that diphtheria- is more*
to be dreaded here than bubonic plague.

BRIEF DELAYS IN
THE WESTWARD RUN
Difficulties Overcome by the Automo
bile and Great Enthusiasm Shown
All Along the Route.
BY JOHN D. DAVIS.
HUDSON, N. V.. July 15.â
From Poughkeepsie the
run to-day was fast and
fine, the motor working
perfectly until we
reached Red Hook, where a new
road, apparently solid, gave
way, throwing the carriage into
the ditch, but not upsetting it.
The sudden jar snapped a brass
casting that controls the valve
on the rear cylinder. It took
nearly three hours to repair the
break, and then it was done
with a bit of brass and some
solder.
We struck some speed later,
and the friction ' melted the
solder, causing a second delay
of half an hour. The solder
again gave way, and we came
into Hudson at 5 o'clock with one
cylinder working.
The roads to-day were excel
lent at times, and again miser
able. Our road meter shows a
distance of fifty-seven miles
traveled. We used five gallons
of gasoline.
All grades were easily made,
most of them at second speed.
The entire route has been the
scene of a continual reception,
people having been out every
where to greet us and express
interest in the trip and the car
riage. To-night a new combina
tion of steel is being made, and
we will be ready to start early
in the morning.
Colonel Charles S. Rogers, for
merly of Governor Flower's
staff, entertained us this even
ing.

J SAN QUENTIN PRISON, July. 15.â
. Frank Hunter, a convict, was brought
â before the Board of State Prison Direc
tors at to-day's session, to be disciplin- ;
cd. When Hunter entered the room the |
board and several prison officials were j
seated . carelessly .around a table, en
gaged in conversation. In less than i
; two minutes^ he had every member of j
j the board simply, dumfounded by his;
i .statements. ?He : was", charged with
j smoking opium : in his cell- and having
â  a, vdeadly. -i.weapon* in jj his' possession.
i Hunter ' claimed he had the knife on his
; jpersbh'.^by "accident and added that his .
punishment should not.be made too se- j
i vere, because there were a. dozen such )
knives. in. the possession of convicts in
' the jute mill,' and the facts were known j
6b 'thi prison officials.. 7. "â¢ "
â¢What's that?" fairly yelled, the im- j
perturbable Devlin, starting from his j
chair., -.dozen: such knives as. these" ,
h â holding up ; the .*six inch dirk offered i
as evidenceâ "when this board only re- ;
cently made an order that no knives
were to be permitted prisoners and fixed :
life Imprisonment in the incorrigible
ward as punishment for a violation of i
the rule?" â, 'â  _-
"How about that, warden? demanded :
President Fitzgerald. Warden Aguirre !
mutely turned to Captain of the Yard I
Edgar, who admitted that if the knives j
were in the mill he did not know it. !
Couriers were hastily dispatched for ;
Chief Alden of the jute mill police and j
! Guard Randolph. Alden declared that
only two such weapons were in use to
his knowledge, and that they were used
for cutting holes in belting. All the
directors declared that a knife with an
inch blade was sufficient for such a
purpose and Director Devlin added. that I
the incorrigible cells would soon be |
filled if better discipline were not main- j
tamed. .
Hunter was sent to the Incorrigible
ward for life, as was William Phelan.
for having struck another prisoner oyer
the head with a shuttle in the jute mill.
- Warden Aguirre's report contained a
number of recommendations as regards
| prison reforms. A suggestion that the
yard be better lighted by electricity met
i the favor of the board: Better bathing
facilities were represented as an abso
lute necessity. The cost of construct
ing two bath houses will approximate
$1100. On motion of Wilkins it was de
cided that the cost of each be estimated
In order that they may be built sepa
rately. WardertVAguirre was authorized
to place an iron pipe railing aroui.d.the
main" prison wall in place of the present
wooden railing, which is in so rickety a
condition as to render patrol duty dan
gerous.

J seven miles covered, and Mr. Davis
says five gallons of gasoline was used.
j The travelers were entertained by Col-
I onel Charles S. Rogers, formerly of
! Governor Flower's staff, to-night. Their
, troubles began at Red Hook. The
trip from Poughkeepsie had been pleas
i ant and easy up to that point. They
i found the only road through the village
torn up by roadmakers. who, believing
that a firm foundation Is a good begin
i ning in road construction, had piled the
; street full of rocks, varying from six to
j ten inches in diameter. They left a side
! space of .apparently hard dirt, and Mr.
; Davis steered for this, only to find it
i soft and yielding. _ One side of the mo
! tor instantly sank, and the carriage
! would have been overturned had not
Mr. Davis skillfully headed it into the
! ditch. The motor could not be stopped
until after it had climbed the sidewalk
| and had threatened the destruction of
a fence. In mounting the patch, the
pettycock of the motor with which Mr.
Davis has had so much trouble, and the
brass valve adjuster, or controller, were
broken. V â 
The accident necessitated a three
mile tramp to a blacksmith shop that
proved fruitless. The .controller was
soldered and a new seat was made. As
soon as speed was made the solder
melted and another delay ensued. The
crack in the controller was finally
closed by means of wire and the jour
ney was once more resumed, although
only a slow rate of speed could be
taken. No further accidents and no in
; cidents worthy of note occurred.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis have been re
' ceived with great enthusiasm during
bags sold and not yet delivered, $101,

In executive session the board decided
to recommend Albert Gress to the Gov
ernor for a pardon. He has two years
more to serve on an eight-year sen
tence from Tuolumne County for man
slaughter, but is dying of consumption.
The "Warden reported that he had found
it expedient to give the convicts con
fined in the .incorrigible cells a little
light reading matter once each month.
His grain bag and jute report varied
only slightly from last month.
BULLS FIGHT OVER
HIS SENSELESS BGHY
Point Reyes Lad Pays Dearly for an
Attempt to Separate En
raged Animals.
POINT REYES STATION, July 15.â
Two fierce bulls, one owned by P. Rein
hold and the other by a neighbor, were
engaged in a terrific contest in Rein
hold's barn yard yesterday. The farmer's
eleven-year-old son entered the yard and
tried by throwing stones to make them
cease fighting. Both of the infuriated ani
mals rushed at the lad at the same in
stant. He ran for the barn and was over
taken while opening the door. As they
tried to gore him the horns of the infuri
ated animals became locKed and they
again started to battle over the boy's
prostrate form. _ â  .
Hearing his agonized cries for help, a
farm employe rushed to the scene and,
perceiving the little fellow's plight, he
quickly procured a pitchfork and started
to jab both the bulls with a will. His
determined assault was victorious and the
enraged animals were put to flight.
The unconscious boy was carried to the
house and Dr. Cavanaugh was summoned.
He found that his patient's right hip had
been disjointed, his leg badly torn and
other injuries of a minor nature received.
While the wounds are severe, no fatal
result is expected. - /

STRANGE STORY TOLD BY THE
ASPIRANT. S^'ii
i-'.7*-r-â â¦â â -
Declares He Is the Supposedly Dead
Lord Charles Hamilton,
Whose Burial Was a
Bogus One.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, July 15.â People were
growing tired of dukedom and earl
dom claimant cases, about which so
much interest was aroused, and we
had not heard anything about them for
a long time, but they have suddenly
come to the front again. Two of the
most important are the claims to the
dukedom of Hamilton .and the.earldrom
of Buchan, and they are now creating
a sensation in Scotland.
Colin G. Hamilton, the claimant,
made his appearance on the Island of
Auan, which is one of the Hamilton
possessions, and took up his residence
in Brodick Hotel, but the angry na
" tives made it too hot for him, and he
is now In Glasgow working up his case.
He is following the plan of the well
known Mrs. Druce, and claims that he
is the supposedly dead Lord Charles
Hamilton, whose burial was a bogus
one, and that the grave is full of
bricks. One thing true is that no med
ical attendant was present at the
death of Lord Charles, an undertaker
at Nice signing the certificate of death.
The story is published in the Morning
Leader, however, that Gunn's story is
true, not about Lord Charles but con
cerning the method employed to. rid the
country of a near relative now domi
ciled in the State:, and criminally afraid
to set foot in England. The case is to
come before the court shortly, and is
expected to be a prolonged one.
Two claimants to the earldom of
Buchan have come to an arrangement.
Erskine, the Chile claimant, is to stand
j aside, while Milton Bradford, the Lon
'â  don solicitor, has his try; then, Brad
ford failing, Erskine will have a shot
at it. - â¢â¢
A lot of fun may be made of Mrs. i
i Druce in her claim for the Portland
title on behalf of her son, but there is
! something pathetic in the persistency
1 with which she is pursuing it. It is not
j so much the faith she has in her story
which is amazing, but the number of
people whom she has contrived to Â» win
I over to her side. She evidently ceased
! her activity only through having spent
all her ample means in her melancholy
1 chase after a bigger fortune and title
for her son, but about $100,000 has been
raised by private subscription, and
! soon she will appear in the law courts
to lodge an appeal against the last de
cision for an opening of the Druce
vaults, which went against her.
MAYBRICK WAS AN
EATER OF ARSENIC
Important Evidence Placed in the
7 Hands of Embassador
'â ;':"â  t _i;'.' Choate.
NEW YORK, July 15.â A Norfolk.
Va;, special to the Herald says: Prob
ably the most important bit of late evi
dence brought to light In the case of
Mrs % Maybrick has been furnished by
C. F Greenwood, a jeweler of this city.
Mr. Greenwood does not believe that
Mrs. Maybri-k poisoned her husband,
but that his death was due to his long
use of arsenic. He has made a sworn
statement that Maybrick was an ar
senic toper. The affidavit has been sent
to the State Department, and through
that department to Embassador Choate
in London. -;
Mr. Greenwood says that several
years ago, when the May bricks resided
in Norfolk, he became acquainted with
Mr. May brick's passion for arsenic.
"He came' into my store one day," said
Mr. Greenwood, "and taking a small pack
age from his vest pocket extracted a tab
let. Holding it in view he said: 'Green
wood, if you took that 1 guess it would
kill you.' I asked him what It was.
'Arsenic,' he replied. Surprised, I said:
'Why do you take them? Some day
thev*'ll kill you." To which Maybrick
ligHtly replied that the tablets relieved
him of nervousness, from which he suf
fered.
"It's a well known fact that Maybrick
was a confirmed arsenic eatsr. Why,
there are numbers of people here who can
testify to the fact. 1 made the affidavit
because I was and am still impressed with
the belief that if efforts in Mrs. May
brick's behalf are continued it will be
demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt
that she is what I believe her to be â in
nocent of the foul crime for which she has
been so unjustly punished."

I have been afflicted with severe nasal catarrh for two years, which a few months
since extended to my throat, producing a distressing cough and seriously impairing my
health generally. I have been under the treatment of Dr. Aborn for about three
weeks and have been already greatly relieved, my cough has almost disappeared, and
my health greatly improved. By one application Dr. Aborn relieved me of a severe
neuralgic pain, and with four applications It was entirely cured. âââââ__â

Were it not for the good which I hope It may have done to suffering humanity, by
informing them where they could find relief. I should regret having given Dr. Aborn
my little testimonial of the 10th January*, for the demands made upon my time in
answering inquiries In regard to him have been more numerous than profitable to me;

Aborn, and my confidence In
THE PERMANENCE OF THE CURE
Effected by him. All my difficulty arose from catarrh, which had become of a serious
character affecting the hearing and the throat, giving me at times acute pains and at
others rumbling sounds In the ears, frequent headaches, and so seriously affecting the
bronchial tubes as to sometimes disable me from public speaking. It Is all gone, and
the change was produced, not by the absurd practice of putting medicines into the
stomach which was not affected, but by the skillful application of medicinal remedies
directly to the parts which were diseased. I have found the Doctor a gentleman in his
intercourse and business, and the Judgment that I have formed of him professionally
is that he is a regular physician, thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of the hu-
man body, and possessing a remarkable degree of skill in the treatment of those
diseases which he makes his specialty. CHARLES If. FOX.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
The undersigned, a resident of the city of Dcs Moines for the past thirty-seven
years desires to bear testimony to the skill of . Dr. Aborn in the treatment of pul-
monary and kindred complaints. About the year 1876 I was very seriously afflicted
with bronchial and lung troubles: in fact, had two or three quite severe hemorrhages
and my left lung was practically useless. Dr. Aborn treated me constitutionally and
hv local inhalation applications, and within two months' time I was practically
cured I continued the treatment for some time longer and have never suffered a day
since 'from any trouble of the kind. And my lungs and bronchial tubes have been
sound I believe, as any one's could be, and are at the present time, after a lapse
of twenty-three-years. I have . known the doctor and of his successful practice for the
past thirty the doctor's practice at ._____________:''- personally knew of a number of people
During the doctor's practice at that time I personally knew of a number of people
whom he treated with pronounced success. From my own personal experience and
observation of his treatment of others I believe the doctor to be capable of dotna a
ereat good to person* afflicted with such troubles. Very respectfully, " *

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, July 15.â The Pope is. much
pleased at the success of the council of
Bishops of the Latin-American church,
which has just concluded its delibera
tions at Rome. Subjects which were
expected to show differences of opinion
almost impossible to reconcile were,
disposed of with a minimum of friction.
Perhaps the most important was the
scheme for severing the Latin-Ameri
can episcopate from the jurisdiction
and control of the Spanish Primate.
This was finally imposed, despite ve
hement protests from the Spanish
church. Henceforth the church of
South America- will have an American
born primate chosen by the Pope him
self, ij
In future, also, there will be an Iden
tical liturgy, ecclesiastical code, etc.,
for South American churches, irrespec
tive of the states wherein they are lo
ted
The council's report was submitted
to the Pope this week and formally ap
proved. The new primate will be
nominated at the next consistory and
will be immediately raised to the dig
nity of Cardinal.
In this connection there is now a
great diplomatic struggle at the Vati
can between the representatives of the
various South American republics.
Each contends for the honor of having
the seat of the new primacy within its
borders.
Chile is furiously jealous at the id*a
of a Cardinal being installed at Buenos
Ayres, on which Argentina insists .by
virtue of her wealth and territorial
greatness. The republic of Brazil joins
issue with Chile on these grounds.
Mexico demands the primacy on ac
count of seniority.
The Pope "will address an encyclical

I Santa Cruz's reception to-night
vâ^to the League of the Cross Cadets
was a fitting one. Almost the en

i turned out and welcomed the well
known organization. A large aggrega

in a special train there were cheers and
waving of handkerchiefs. . 7_i v._
The cadets arrived in this city at 6:55
' p. m., their journey to their camping
ground being without accident. The
cadets filled nine passenger cars and
amused themselves en route with songs
and cheering. Immediately upon leav
ing the cars the command formed in
line and marched to Camp Fallon. At
the head of the splendid body of cadets
was its commander, Colonel William P.
Sullivan, Jr., and behind him was his
staff. Then came the band witl>-**hardly
a musician missing, and following in its
footsteps was the fife and drum corps.
The command _ wheeled Into Pacific
avenue shortly after 7 o'clock, and as it
passed by the residents -fluttered hand
kerchiefs at the boys in blue and com
mented favorably on their soldierly_ap
pearance. The summer guests at the

sight of the cadets silhouetted against

pretty one. The music of the band and
fife and drum corps drowned the roar
of the waves. ;:^*.7'
On reaching Camp Fallon the battal

Nothing whatever was brought to him
In connection with the all Important
work affecting the conduct of the war
in the Philppines. :^"v
The fact that General Miles has hold
of the reins of the War Department,
notwithstanding that Alger has more
than once begged the President to re
tire the general from command of the
army, is regarded as another direct
slap at the Secretary. It remains to be
seen whether this additional hint will
have any effect upon the man who says
he will not retire "under fire." It Is not
believed by members of the Cabinet
that Secretary Alger will be allowed
until the first of the year to submit his
resignation. His last public utterance
indicated that he might "voluntarily"
step down and out about January 1, but
I. was told by a Cabinet officer to-day
that the President had contemplated
giving him only sufficient time to com
plete his annual report, which is usually
handed In about November 1. If a vote
were taken in the Cabinet to-day there
would probably be a unanimous j ver
dict that Mr. Alger ought to go at
once.

ALL FILIPINOS KILLED,
NO PRISONERS TAKEN
STOCKTON, July 15.â That the life of a
soldier in the Philippines is calculated to
transform a mild .; mannered young man
into a mere fighting machine, having little
regard for human life and less thought for
the strict observance of the rules of civ
ilized warfare, is evident from a private
letter received here from a young Ala
medan now serving In the Twenty-third
United States Infantry at Cebu.
The writer is not given to exaggeration,
and his comments confirm the recently de
nied stories of the giving of no quarter to
the natives, of shooting them after they
surrendered and of thoughtless soldiers
seeking to stir up trouble with the peace
ably inclined people. To the credit of the
American officers, it will be seen that they
did not know of the deeds of the soldiers.
Excerpts from the letter are as here
given: '
"You remember reading of the horrible
death of Dr. Young of â¢ the Utahs. â¢'.*-â¢
An hour after he was found they sent the
news over to us, and all the rest of the
day we killed every insurgent we saw, in
stead of taking, them prisoners. The men
got so crazed over the news that when
they saw an insurgent near by they would
wait till the officers were not looking and
would deliberately shoot them. ;I; could
tell you things that would â  give * you the

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., July 15.â Two
negroes were killed outright and an
other fatally shot in a fight to-night at
Ishkoda between the striking miners
and the negroes who have been import
ed from Georgia to take their places.
After the first brush the firing became
almost general throughout the mining
town, but deputies who were sent from
here had restored quiet at midnight.
The killing seems to have been the
result of- a plot. To-night about ' 9
o'clock twenty-five or thirty negroes
were gathered In one of the large mess
halls of the company eating water
melons. The house was suddenly fired
on from ambush. Fully two hundred,
shots were fired and . the walls were
riddled. The negroes scattered in ev
ery direction, i'. "â ;-_ .' :
When the deputies reached the house
they found the bodies of two negroes
shot to pieces. Sixteen bullets had pass
ed through one. - ..-z
A third was found in a dying condi

several other places. It oecame s*â¢ gen

with the situation and Sheriff O'Brien
was notified. A special train left here

DESERTED TO VISIT
HIS DYING MOTHER
ANY, Or., July Frank M. Gl
rard, a member of Company I, Oregon
Volunteers, arrived here to-day from San
Francisco. He came In violation of or
ders but in a manner which will arouse
sympathy in his behalf. On reaching San
Francisco harbor, while still on shipboard,
he received a telegram announcing that
his mother, who resides near Monmouth,
was ing and asking him to come at
once. He applied to the officer for a fur
lough offering the telegram as a reason,
but it was refused. By the aid of sym
pathetic comrades he was let down by a
rope into a small boat and went ashore,
taking the train at once for Albany. He .
hired a team and driver here and hurried
to his home. After remaining at- his ;
mother's bedside a few minutes he came
out weeping and said she was yet alive
but very low. He told the driver that he
would return to his regiment in a few
days. He is a young man of unquestioned
veracity and has been one of the best
soldiers In his company. Influential
friends will endeavor to secure his release
from the serious charge of desertion.
AMERICAN SURGEONS

TACOMA. Wash., July 15.â Major Sur

case where wounded Filipinos have tried

On the contrary, they have welcomed our
assistance and have been grateful for it.
Dr. Dawson denies the truth of a sensa

which he was said to have been dressing
the wounds of three FUlppinos who at

If men would only take the most com-
mon sense precautions j against the en-
croachments of ill-health, there would be
fewer .h ouses of mourning, and fewer
women left alone almost helpless before
the battle of life is half over. A man's
liver and stomach are twin machines that
work together, either to make or unmake.
If they work wrong, they deplete and
poison his blood. Impure and impover-
ished blood mean sickness and death. If
they work right, they purify and enrich
the blood. A man whose blood is rich and
pure, and whose liver is active cannot well
be unhealthy. . Headaches, biliousness, in-
digestion and costiveness, which men gen-
erally disregard, are Nature's warnings
that the twin mechanism, stomach and
liver, is working against, instead of fot
him. Dr.' Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery is the best medicine to use under these
circumstances. It creates appetite, 1 cor-
rects all disorders of the digestion, invigor-

across the plains to the Rocky Moun
tains. We started from Fort Leaven
worth." â¢
Speaking of the next campaign in the
Philippines General Wheeler remarked:
"I presume the season will permit mili
tary operations to be renewed early in
October, and I hope that one campaign
will end the fighting. I was misquoted
In one of the Eastern interviews, when
I was reported as saying that no in
formation had been obtained regarding
the strength of the enemy and the num
ber of our own troops available.
"Yes, I may return from the Philip
pines to attend the next session of Con
gress. I am the representative of my
district in Congress. My rank in the
army at Santiago was major general,
but I was mustered out and reappointed
brigadier general. Generals Otis, Law
ton and Mac Arthur, who are now at
the front, rank me. General Young is
also there, but I am his senior in rank.
It will be my pleasure to go to the
front. Of course, a cavalry command
would suit me, but that may be impos
sible. I shall cheerfully accept what
ever assignment may be made."
General Wheeler asked many ques
tions touching the reports brought by
the Oregon volunteers concerning the
discipline and fighting qualities of the
Filipino army. He seemed .to be Im
pressed with the notion that the insur
gents were receiving supplies of arms
and ammunition from Hongkong or
some other port. ;"â .*.
General Wheeler will not tarry in San
Francisco longer than is necessary to
make his arrangements for his voyage
to Manila. On the arrival of the be
lated train last night he went directly
to the Occidental. Hotel, where accom
modations had been â¢ reserved for him
self end companions.
It will afford him great pleasure to
again meet General Shatter, who so
ably commanded the forces in the field
before . Santiago. General Wheeler Is
not one of the military men who con
tend that the American army was in a
bad wav a few days before the Span
iards surrendered. He holds that after
the battle of San Juan the American
position was not one of peril.
Joseph heeler, a son of the general,
has been commissioned major of the

Wnile the Statute of Limitations Is

Pull Is at Work to Save

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 15.â A Washing
ton special to the Journal says: An
other recently developed feature of
Captain Carter's case is that two of the
important witnesses have died. In case.,
civil suits are brought against Carter
or the contractors it is doubtful if they
could be convicted, as the evidence
given in the co-urt-martial cannot be
used in civil proceedings. The statute
of limitations is constantly running
against the dates at which civil suits
can commenced for sums embezzled
from time to time extending over the
period of from ten to twelve years that
Carter had charge of the district.
It is estimated that at least $400,000,
properly recoverable, has escaped by
reason of the failure of bringing civil
suits. The sum of $25,000 is escaping
every month.
Politicians and millions of money are
exerting their potent influence to save
Carter from punishment. Since his
mammoth steal was affirmed by the
court of the highest army officers, and
the most disgraceful penalty devisable
was Imposed, a half-score of officers
have been court-martialed and dis
missed. .
Senator Piatt is the. most conspicuous
pleader for executive clemency for Car

Special r>'Â«pat'-h to Th- Call.
KBW YORK, July Morris K. Jessup,
president of the New York Chamber of
Commerce a: _ president of the Peary
Arctic Club, int.- organized an expedition
which is to start from Sydney. C. 8., to
find and Join Lieutenant Peary, If pos
sible, In tho frozen north. The expedition
will bo under the direction of Herbert _.
Bridgman, secretary of the club, who left
Now York last week to join his ship at
St. Johns. The project of the expedition
was clearly defined by Lieutenant Peary
before his department last summer, and
is a constituent part of his general plan
of operations for reaching the north pole.
The main aim is to deposit, against ail
contingencies an ample supply of food
at Inglefield Gulf and to Inform Peary -it
the tact, so that in case disaster drives
him back he may find subsistence in a
region where he is practically at home.
Tho Diana, the ship which carries the
expedition. Is of 473 gross and 273 net tons,
with 70-horsepower engines of an average
speed of eight Knots an hour. Leaving
Sydney, where she is expected to arrive
In ilv- days, the Diana's ttrat stop will be
at Disco, la Northern Greenland, where
intelligence from the north may be ob
tained.
The next call will be made at Upernavik,
by direction of Mr. Peary, and thence
tiie voyage will be prosecuted with the
utmost" speed possible across Melville Bay
and beyond Cape York to Peary's former
headquarters at Bow Join Bay, in Ingle
field Gulf. The Diana will comply with
Peary's instructions to deposit for him
and for his party supplies at Bowdoin Bay
if a landing can be effected, and if not at
Littleton Island. In each case proper pre
cautions will be taken to Insure the safety
of the caches and the most effective ar
rangements made to secure the comfort
and safety of the explorer and his party
whenever they shall return to either of
the points designated.
The voyage of the Diana is likely to be
fraught with very much more than usual
public interest. In addition to her own
experiences she will probably bring back
full news of the fate of the Windward,
Peary's ship of last summer, from which
nothing has been heard since she left
Etah to attempt the passage of Smitn
Sound to land the explorer north of Sher
rard Osborn Fjord, and also information
concerning the Norwegian party in the
Fram ana their work during last winter.
It is by no means certain that Mr. Peary
will be seen or directly communicated
with. If everything has gone well with
him and his headquarters at Cape Wash
ington or some equally far northern point
has been safely maintained it is not
likely that he will return to Inglefield Gulf
to meet the Diana. Only in case of dis
aster or loss of provisions, compelling him
to fall back on his base, would he be likely
to undertake a journey across inland ico
for the summer to open communication
with the world. The supplies for the ex
pedition weigh in all over fifty tons, and
were shipped in sealed cars, all rail from
New York via Boston and Portland to
Sydney. - : .
The !ast letter from Peary is dated
Etah, August 7, 1808, in which he said: .
"Wednesday morning the Hope started
for Littleton Island and at 9 p. m. joined
the Windward, anchored off the deserted
settlement of Etah. in Foulke Fjord. Both
ships are now here. To-morrow the Hope
will start south and the Windward north.
In passing north I shall land some provi
sions on Littleton Island for use in case
the Windward is crushed going up. . I
have on board now ten Eskimos (five
couples), with their sledges, tents, kayaks
and belongings: about sixty dogs, sixty
walrus and a fair supply of extra cloth-
Ing."
< NEW PASTOR WELCOMED.

SAN RAFAEL.' July 15.â This was a
memorable day for the parishioners of
St. Raphael's parish. Rev. Father Phil
lips of Berkeley, who succeeds Rev.
Father Lagan as pastor, arrived on a
morning train and was greeted at the de
pot by a large number of communicants,
Father Lagan was present to welcome the
new pastor and wish him success in his
new field. :~..c, â¢- - .
The active members of the parish are
now preparing an entertainment and re

choice programme will be presented and
everything possible dpne to make the new
pastor feel that he has come among peo
ple thoroughly appreciative of. talent and
earnest labor. * .
The leave-taking of Father Lagan and
his friends was very affecting. A larpe
crowd was at the depot to wish him god
speed, and many jumped upon the plat
form to wring his hand at parting. Tho
popular priest was keenly moved, espe
cially by the fact that sectarianism
seemed to cut no figure in the farewell.

Admiral Cervera's Cabin Boy Ap

!D 'â 'â¢â â  NEW YORK. July 15.â Pedro Ovida, who was' Admiral Cervera's Â©
J bugler and cabin-boy on the Spanish cruiser Viscaya. is waiting g
5 anxiously for news from Washington. He made formal application to Â«
8 be appointed apprentice In the United States navy, but Rear Admiral g
6 Philip, commandant of the Brooklyn navy-yard, has raised the . techm- "
>J cal point that Pedro may be considered a deserter from the Spanish g
; O navy. This knotty problem has been referred to the Navy Department .Â£
j 88 for solution. Meanwhile the boy is living in Brooklyn. Pedro said to- Â«
j <3 day concerning the Santiago battle: 0
!S3 "As the ships closed in I was up in the superstructure with my 53
i <** bugle. The Texas and lowa came toward us and the Brooklyn made for Â£
S the Colon. The first shot that hit us was from the Texas. It struck g
i I. in the afterpart of the ship." iS
! p Pedro. said he was not frightened, but, thinking of his father and 0
! Â£-? mother, he rushed below to the boiler room. Â g
$ "There was plenty of steam there," he continued. "The shells had j,
$ burst the boiler, and In a little while some one shouted we were sinking.- g;
*S 1 came on deck again and every one was jumping overboard. We were Â» I
â¢Â£-{ very near the beach then, so I ran forward and jumped over, too. The gj
Â§ deck was pretty close to the water, and 1 fell only about twelve feet." g j
;â¢ Pedro said he couldn't swim, but he had a life-preserver on. g!
Â£ "I was In the water an hour." he said, "and the wreckage cut me ter- g |
|iS rfbly. At last a launch from the Texas-picked us up and we were taken #
j 8 to the St. Paul. I do not want to go home, because I will only be a bur- S3
j Â£ den to them. Papa gets $1 a day in Spanish money as a machinist in g
i Â£*? the navy-yard at Bilboa, and has six children to support. In your g
g navy I can get $9 a month right away, and in a year $15, and then. $21, 5;
l-g with the chance of being gunners' mate or electrician. If I return to #

LONDON, July 15.â William Harper
: of " the . Philadelphia Commercial Mv-
I scum, who is just completing a two
' years' tour of the world, collecting
samples of the chief articles the various
nations import, is abcut to forward to I
the United States a collection of the I
most remarkable sample cases ever |
amassed. During the course of his
quest Mr. Harper penetrated to the
I utmost corners of Russia, Asia, Africa,
: Australia and South America and com
piled a vast amount of information as
jto the requirements of the various
i countries, samples of goods, models of
implements and photographs and speci
fications of all the leading articles of
! trade, all of which will be on exhibi
: tion in Philadelphia during the month
of October.
"It is a $50,000 sample case," said Mr.
! Harper to a representative of the Asso
'â â  ciated Press, "'and I' do not think its
'. like Is equaled in the world. It con
[ tains engine models from France, hay
j racks from Russia, textiles from Aleppo
j and Central Asia", cotton from Hong-
I kong and mining tools from the Trans
! vaal. Undoubtedly America has im- .
i mense possibilities for developing her
; exports and I believe the results of my
j researches will greatly aid therein.
"As regards the growth of American
i exports to England, I believe it is
largely due to the fact of Increased con
i sumption of the world generally. Eng
' land' is probably supplying the same as
before, but America is supplying the
surplus. While England is standing
still,' we are growing. The question of
speed is also a great factor. America
: manufactures in such quantities that
i she can produce a completed article
I phenomenally -quick. The point Is well
j exemplified by the following, state
! ments. An official of the Baldwin Loco
; motive Works wrote that they had lo
| comotives lying around on the shelves
and that it was only necessary for a j
j machinist to put the parts . together,
while a French engineer told me a few
I days ago that of fifty engines he built
I recently, no two were alike.
"In the course of my journeying I
j have given the American Consular ser
vice considerable study, and while the
I tenure of office of the English system
; makes Consuls better linguists and dip
lomats, they are often lacking in busi
j ness qualifications. As commercial
| missionaries, I believe the American
j Consuls are the most efficient. All such
I men as Mason at Berlin, Monaghan at
; Chemnitz and Boyle and Marshal Hal
| sted In England, and Bell at Sydney
i are doing great work toward the.devel
j opment of the American market."
The announcement of the British
! Westlnghouse Company, with a capital
! of $1,500,000, caused the. usual expres
j sions of pained surprise in the Eng
j lish newspapers and in commercial cir- j
I cles, although they must be aware that |
j most of the finer electrical appliances I
! used In England are of American make. j
| The Pall Mall Gazette complains that !
the Board of Trade returns do not af-
I ford the opportunity of estimating the i
j magnitude of these reports, and con- i
demns the lack of enterprise of the
home electricians in permitting Amer
ican:' to beat them on their ' own
ground. â¢ Â»-"7.. -*â¢
The; c .-â¢ a recrudescence of anxiety '
regarding 'lie Alaska dispute in politi- !
i cal circles, though the general public !
j does not attach much importance to
â¢ the matter. Jingo newspapers, like the
; Saturday Review, grasped the oppor
tunity to 'reair their anti -American
proclivities.
The Review thinks that as the time
for the Presidential nominations ap- i
proaches President McKinley may "find
the Cleveland precedent over-tempting
and launch an arrogant Alaska mes
sage against England, the recognition
of which will be very different to the I
success attending the Venezuelan."
' After asserting that the Canadians s
desire to finally decide the matter by
impartial debate, while the United |
| States demands a tribunal which will
be either a farce or unlikely to settle i
! anything the Review* says "We cannot :
| concede that to the United States with- |
! out Canadian acceptance, and our ex- I
perience in that direction does not give
much hope of the efficacy of conces
sions even if we do."
...-. In conclusion the Review remarks:
"If the Anglo-Saxon' entente does noth
ing to modify the I American attitude
-toward Alaska it will have proved more
useless and evanescent than the bub
bles of the champagne on which it

Hard Feeling That Exists Between

Forces Is Considerably
... , on the Increase,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 15.â bitter
I feeling between the leaders of Tar
n; many Hall and the Kings County Dem
; ocrats has led to a movement' for re
, pudiation, by the New York Democrats
jof Augustus Van Wyck',s boom for
J President. The Van Wyck boom, it
I will be recalled by students of political
events, was formally launched in Tam
many Hall on July 4, when Joseph J.
Willett of Alabama proposed the . for
mer Judge as the most promising can
| didate to defeat the nomination of Wil
j liam J. Bryan in the next national con
i vention.
The real Tammany leaders are sup
porting former Senator Arthur P. Gor
man of Maryland for President, and
In order that their position may â¢ not
be misunderstood plans are under way
to formally repudiate Augustus Van
Wyck's boom at a meeting of the Dem
ocratic National Committee In Chicago
next Thursday. Such a repudiation
will anger the . King County leaders,
but Tammany men are not worrying
about that. They are more worried
over the possibility that their well-laid
Gorman plans may be entirely upset by
the Van Wyck boom, unless they frown
upon the candidacy of the Brooklyn
man. . :r :^.'
Chairman Campbell, accompanied by
Thomas Hassett, went to Long Branch
to-day and conferred with former Sen
ator Edward Murphy and other leaders
as to the party policies New York
should advocate at the meeting of the
National Committee. Mr. Campbell had
nothing to say for publication, but it
was learned from other sources that he
had been- advised by influential leaders
to make it known to members of the
National Committee in Chicago that
New York Democrats will present no
candidate for President in the national
convention.
If Chairman Campbell acts on this
advice, as he probably will, the claims
of the Van Wyck boom to consideration
will rest entirely upon the efforts of
Southern Democrats, who are kindly
disposed toward the former Judge.
Tho repudiation of the Brooklyn man
by the party leaders outside of Kings
County will increase the hard feeling
that exists between the McLaughlin
and Croker forces, and may lead to
sharp politics on the part of both or
ganizations at the next National Con
' vention. Hugh McLaughlin seldom has
acted with Tammany in State or na
tional gatherings, and if the plan of
repudiating the Van Wyck boom is car
ried the Brooklyn delegates will make
more trouble than ever for Tammany
in the convention of 1900. They may. do
as much harm to Tammany's plans as
j they did in the convention of ISS4, when
| they refused to support \ Roswell P.
i Flower, who was Tammany's candidate
j for President, and declared for Cleve

SETTLING VAT ROBBED
OF GOLDEN SEDIMENT
Thieves Make a Fair Haul, at the
Pioneer Reduction Works in,
Nevada County.
NEVADA V CITY, July 15.â Two thou
sand dollars worth of. chloride of gold
was stolen from the settling vat at the
Pioneer Reduction Works on Gold Flat,
in this township, last night. There is no j
clue to the thieves. . It was one of the
boldest crimes committed here in years.
The thieves, of whom there seem to have
been, three, were undoubtedly familiar
with the premises.
James Snell, August Hoffman and El
mer Simmons were working around the
j roasting furnaces all night. The fur- |
naces are about sixty feet from the set- j
: tling vat, which is the last of a series i
I of large ones, being the furthest from ;
. the furnace room of any of the set. The j
furnace men had no occasion during the
night to go into the vat room, which was, |
as usual, in darkness. Had a light been!
used there it would doubtless have at
tracted their attention.
When William Reynolds, who works
! among the vats, came on shift at 7. o'clock
! this morning he noticed that the water \
, which last evening nearly filled the set
tler had been drawn through the faucet :
â  and Hooded the floor in that locality. An
! investigation showed that after the wa- !
! ter ran out one of the thieves had clam- I
i bered into the vat and removed nearly all
of the sediment, which consisted largely
of precipitated sold. It had possibly been
scraped up with a cup and carried off in ;
a water-tight vessel, as none of it was ;
spilled outside, nor was there any candle
grease around to indicate that a light {
had. been used. The -footprints of three
men' led alongside the building, and be- i
neath the windows the trio had gone down ;
on hands and feet to slip unobserved past
the furnace men. The tracks led toward j
Nevada City. ]
FLEES WITH A WOMAN.
Reported Elopement of a Priest From
" \ . 7 an lowa Parish.
'OMAHA, July 15.â A sensational eloper i
ment is reported from Pawnee County. I
Father Joseph Rhinehart, a priest of the \
Steinauer parish, one of the best known j
and most eloquent divines in the county, j
eloped to Springfield, 111., with Mrs. Henry I
Schmidt, his housekeeper, who had be
come infatuated with him. Michael Steint
fer, an officer, was at once put on the
track of the truant couple and located
them at Springfield, 111. Requisition pa
pers were made out in. blank and the of- !
ficer departed for that city. He learned j
from Rev.. Father Strum, pastor of St. :
Peter's and St.' Paul's Church, that the |
couple had been there, but the priest had
induced them to separate and promise to :
mend their ways. Steinffer returned home j
alone.
Hurled Down an Embankment.
LARKSPUR, July 15.â The celebration I
of the Fall of the Bastile at Escalle last
night was signalized by an accident of
such a nature that the escape of the
persons concerned was little short of a
miracle. In the darkness a buggy in â 
which were Thomas Fox and Timothy
Connelly crashed into a* surrey driven by .
Miss Lydia Lindsay and a buggy contain
ing Miss B. Coleman and a friend. The j
three vehicles and their occupants were 1
thrown down a forty-foot grade. The j
vehicles were smashed but their occu- I
pants and the horses, escaped serious in
jury. Both women were -rendered uncon- '
scious, but a physician found no bones j
broken. â  * *
Sergeant Gleeson Injured.
SAN JOSE, July 15.â Police Sergeant I
Henry P. Gleeson of San Francisco, while |
driving near his ranch at Agnews this j
afternoon, was thrown heavily to the I
ground â¢by the overturning of the buggy '.
and suffered a dislocation of his right I
shoulder, a fracture of the nose and many
painful bruises. He was removed on the
evening train to his home at 16 Hartford I
street, San Francisco. ' '.

Special Dispatch, to The Call.
FRESNO, July. 1.-s.â One of the most dis
astrous fires in the history of Fresno
broke out shortly after 9 o'clock last
night in a small wood-en shed a few feet
north of the City Livery Stables, con
ducted by G. . \\\ Pearson. A few min
utes previous the volunteer fire depart
. in. -m had been summoned to another part
of the city by a false alarm, and when
it reached the scene of the real confla
'. gration the livery stable was. a mass of
flames. All hope of saving the stable
was given up and the department devoted
Its efforts toward saving the surrounding
buildings.
The fire shot across the street and with
in a few minutes another large stable, be
longing to Dorsey _ Parker, was ablaze.
By this time the fire had created a
draught, which carried sparks from the
burning buildings in all directions, and it
was not long before a half-dozen smaller
buildings in the block were burning. The
firemen were confused at first, but they
finally got control of the conflagration
within two hours from the time the alarm
was turned in. â¢
The chief losses, aside from the build
ings, were several fine racehorses i be
longing to Jerrold & Ketehum and "White
Hat" McCarthy. One of these was Trade
Wind, the trotter given to 'McCarthy by
Lord Talbot Clifton. Trade Wind "was
purchased in San Francisco seven or eight
years ago for $23,000. .
Besides. Trade Wind, five local racers
were burned. These included two colts
belonging to F. A. Jerrold arid C. F.
Ketehum, a pacing mare belonging to A.
A. Blaslngame, another mare and a sorrei
running horse belonging to Qua Eisen of
the Eisen vineyard. The loss in horses
alone will probably exceed $50,000.
The buildings were both frame struct
ures, but very large, and contained hay
buggies, harness, etc.. valued at several
thousand. dollar--. The Cltv Livery Stables
were the property of the German Savings
and Loan Society of Ban Francisco and
were partly insured, though the amount of
the insurance is not known. The con
tents belonged to the lessee, G. W. ~ Pear
son, who carried no insurance. Dorsey _
Parker's stable was insured. Their loss
will probably not exceed $5000. 'the other
buildings destroyed were small structures
and of no great value.
While the lire was in progress Gr-orgc
Anderson, a lineman in the employ of the
San Joaquin Electric Company, ascended
a polo near the seat or the conflagration
to repair an electric light wire which had
become loosened from its fastening-- He
was suddenly seen to fall, striking the
pavement on his left side. He was picked
up in an unconscious condition and taken
to the hospital, where he received medical
attendance. It is not thought that he can
recover. The supposition is that he re
ceiyea a shock while repairing the wire
which caused him to fall. The attending
physician gave it as his opinion that the
man had been fatally injured internally.
.During the fire several of the main wires
of the San Joaquin* Electric Company's
plant were burned off, leaving the town
in total darkness for several hours.
Several theories have.been advanced as
to the origin of * the Are. Many persons
think it was incendiary. The fact that
the Are .department was decoyed to a
distant part of the town by a false alarm
just before the fire -, broke oui
strengthens this theory. The same. thing
occurred at the time of the great pack
ing house fire here last fall. Had the flri
department been able to respond -whet
the alarm was turned in there was nÂ«
doubt the buildings could nave . beet
saved.
In addition to the horses that wen
burned there were several others in thÂ«
City Livery Stables when the lire brokt
out.' They were driven into the street and
allowed to care for themselves.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. July 15.â A big Interstate fight |
between Washington and Massachusetts .
was instituted here to-day, a Washington !
man having been kidnaped and brought !
here by the Boston police. There was a
big sensation ln court hero to-day when j
W. E. Baker, the alleged embezzler of j
|SOO from the Adams Express Company, i
who escaped from Captain Dugan and In- i
spector Morrlssey in San Francisco and |
was recaptured and landed here yester- ;
day, was arraigned and held in $4000 bail. â¢
Baker would not plead to the Indictment
against him. acting upon the advice of his '
counsel in such refusal. His refusal is on (
the ground that the court has no jurisdic
tion and that he was illegally arrested at
Seattle. Motions were filed to-day for dis
missal "or false arrest.
Assistant District Attorney Sughrue j
thought substantial bail should be fixed.
He said that the defendant had a dispo- .
sition to avoid prosecution, and he thought
ball should be fixed at $0000. Defendant's j
counsel. Attorney Swasey, opposed the j
motion as most extraordinary. He said
the defendant was in Seattle for a year, j
and when extradition proceedings were !
begun he was admitted to bail in $300. The
amount alleged to have been embezzled
was less than $400, and he thought $1000 |
was ample bail.
He said it was the Intention of the law |
to give a man his liberty on bail. Attor- i
ney Bunyon of counsel for defendant re- [
ferred to the "kidnaping.'' He said the j
defendant was taken from hi- cell and j
out of the State at midnight. His rights i
as a citizen of Washington were not re
spected. He had not taken advantage of |
all his constitutional rights when he was j
taken away. He was instructed that his I
arrest was' false and illegal, and when at I
San Francisco he did escape. He had a j
right to do so. He thought $1000 ample i
bail. If bail were fixed at $5000 the friends I
of the prisoner, upon whom he depends j
for bail, would be predjudlced against j
him. .
Mr. Sughrue ridiculed the Idea that the I
defendant was illegally held. He. said
that if Baker were placed on a smaller
ball he might go away on the same pre
tense that he was illegally held and that j
he had a constitutional right to do so. ,
After a long argument the court finally j
concluded to fix bail at $4000. and the de
fendant was remanded to jail.
Two motions have been filed for his dis- i
charge. This is the principal one in sub- j
stance: Baker alleges that he was an in- .
habitant of and resident of the State of
Washington; that he was wrongfully,
forcibly and against his will and without |
process of law brought from said State of
Washington to this county and without |
proper extradition, and that he is now un- |
der a false arrest and appears in this j
. court against his will and while under I
false arrest. -
Mr. Sughrue aid not think the court \
should follow the custom In Washington. ;
He said that counsel for the defendant re- ;
ferred to the fact that in that State bail j
had been fixed at $3<X). but the Assistant
District Attorney said he wanted to re- j
mind the court that in that same State
bail had been fixed at either $300 or $500
In a case where the man was charged â 
with bribing a Jury. (This was an allu- i
Bi in to the Foy case.) He said that in,
fixing ball the court assumed that the
defendant was guilty.
Redding Votes Against Bonds.
REDDING. July 15.â The proposition to J
bond the city for $20,000 for the purchase j
of a lot and the erection of a new public
school building was voted down to-day.
The lack of interest manifested was re
markable. One hundred and forty-four
votes were cast, forty-six in favor and
ninety-eight against. Redding needs a
new school building very much, and the
people generally are In favor of building.
The conditions of the present bond pro
posal, however, were not favorable. Out
of $20,000 raised by the bonds it was pro
posed to pay off $6000 of old school bonds,
and the people believed the $14,000 remain
ing would be insufficient to erect such a
building as is required, since a high
school also must be provided.

LOS ANGELES, July 15.â de
parture of the teachers and others
who came to Los Angeles to at
tend the National Educational As-
soclation convention has begun in
earnest and over" 2000 of the visitors
will have left Los Angeles by Monday
morning. The Southern Pacific took
out sixteen sleepers at noon, while to
night fourteen additional cars went
north. All accommodations on the Owl
are taken to July 18. The Southern Pa
cific trains to-morrow will all be
crowded. The lowans closed their
headquarters last night, as did also the
Arkansas delegation. The California
headquarters were closed this evening.
The Charleston, S. C, delegation and
the book concerns have folded their
tents and gone.
i Notwithstanding these departures the
arrivals from the. East continue large.
The teachers that are still here have
begun their summer jaunts to the sur
rounding points. The Santa Fe had a
big excursion to San Diego and another
around the kite-shaped track. One ex
tra sleeper went East on the Santa Fe.
Most of the visitors now here will re
main in and about Los Angeles for at
least another week.
The Houghton party of teachers left
at noon to-day for San Franicsco, and
the northern metropolis may expect an
influx of visitors for several weeks.
Of the Eastern States Illinois has had
the largest delegation at the conven
tion, as over 800 members registered
from that State. At this meeting the
largest State attendance naturally was
that of California. The largest city 'â 
delegation came from San Francisco. i
It numbered about 265.
The two concerts that to-night were
given in Hazards Pavilion and in |
Simpson Tabernacle have been eagerly
awaited. The programmes were so I
varied and so choice that lovers of
music found that Los Angeles pos
sessed much capable musical material. :
The chorus of 500 voices at the pavilion
marked a new epoch in musical circles, j
while the 100 women's "voices at Simp- j
son Tabernacle revealed a broad musi- j
cal cultivation. As these concerts were

Present Attitude of Delegates at The

BERLIN. July 15.â Now that a plan
for arbitration has been adopted at The
Hague and the articles regulating war
fare on land have been published, the
press is devoting much attention to the
work of the peace conference. Notwith
standing? the tone ,of skepticism with
which the conference is generally treated,
the opinion is fully expressed that the
results will be considerable and perma
nent. It is admitted that the exagger
-1 ated hopes indulged in by some that the
1 conference would do something to make
'war well nigh impossible in the future
I have not been fulfilled, but it is pointed
! out that the conference is not therefore

ceedingly uncomfortable over the thought
that Germany may be "caught in this
trap," and says it thinks the permanent
> I bureau will ''become a place for i_ng
â¢ llsh intrigue." â . .. â¢
In tf eating the question some of the
papers point out that the United States
and Great Britain have not shown in
practice as much zeal for arbitration as
they have displayed at The Hague. The
refusal of the United States to arbitrate
tho case with Spain, and Great Britain
refusal to so settle the Transvaal diffi
culty are mentioned by the Kreuz Zeitung
and National Zeitung as inconsistent with
their positions at The Hague.
The papers also comment on the United
States' refusal to arbitrate the IJazclton,
FA., affair, as requested by Austria, as be
ing inconsistent with the attitude of the
I American delegates. Otherwise the work
i of the American delegates. Is referred to
: in complimentary terms.
i Great Britain's role at The Hague Is
commented upon with much less approval.
The refusal to abandon the dum-dum bul
let causes bitter remarks upon the sub
ject of what the papers style "England's
uncivilized methods/of warfare."
The Cologne Yolks Zeitung calls atten
tion to the continuous increase of exports
from the United States; while the imports
are continually declining, and confesses
that the United Stages is growing more
nnd more independent of foreign coun
tries It says: "In the iron industry al
ready the United States is strong enough
I to beat England and Germany.*-
The Agrarian Deutsche Tages Zeitung
nrlnts an article claiming that the assert

methods Is an error, adding that the only

The announcement that Russia is about
to order field guns in the United States is
received with doubt here. The Neuezten

ufacturers, claims to know from an un
questionable source that the report is ut
terly untrue, asserts that It Is the product

POOR MARKSMANSHIP SAVED
SOME INTENDED VICTIMS.
But the Prosecution Has Not Yet
Succeeded in Identifying the
Defendant as One of the
Murderous Rioters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLACE. Idaho, July IB.â That the.
rioters who destroyed the Bunker Hill
mill and murdered two men did not kill
more, according to â¢ the evidence to-day,
| was due solely to their poor marksman
ship. The desire to take human life was
present; victims were there in plenty and
the escape of all but two is little short* of
miraculous.
The testimony presented by the State
to-day was directed toward proving the
I killing of Cheyne, with whose murder Paul
Corcoran stands charged. Five witnesses
who were captured by the mob that took
Cheyne's life were examined. R. K.
Rogers, stenographer, and William Huff,
assayer, both in the employ of the Bun
ker Hill Company, were stopped by a
body of masked and armed men as they
were leaving the mill and taken prisoners.
A few moments afterward Cheyne, who
was vanner man at the mill, was seen
making his way along the flume He was
ordered to join the crowd, which he did.
There was evidently a mistake made as
to ('heme's identity, for he was thought
by the rioters to be the mill boss. They
slapped his face and applied vile epithets
to him. * They then ordered him to go
down tho railroad track past the mill.
To this he demurred, saying that it was
an outrage to compel a man to go there
as the fuse had been lighted which would
! soon explode thousands of pounds of
1 dynamite. His refusal seemed to anger
the mob and they ordered Huff, Rogers
I and Cheyne to run for their lives.
Rotters was struck on the head, and
desperate and half crazed the three men
' Blunged down the hill. . Then the mob
ordered them to stop, but the frightened
men never paused. Half way down the
hill Huff stumbled and fell. As he did
bo a bullet carried away part of his upper
lip. Then the mob tired volley after vol
ley after the fleeing men. The bullets
tore un the ground all about them and cut
the shrubbery through which they ran.
Chevne fell, but the others kept on. Huff
reached the river and plunged in. The
! swift current soon carried him out of
i range of his tormentors. Rogers ran up
the street toward the depot and got away
I without further Injury. Mrs. Sinclair and
Mrs. Simons saw Cheyne fall and went to
! his assistance.. He was afterward re
; moved to Spokane, where he died from
! the effects of his wound. . â¢
The prosecution announced to-day that
! they would probably finish their .testi
-1 mony by Tuesday. The defense- will not
< reouire more than two or three days, and
the case will be submitted to the jury
next Saturday or the following Monday.
No evidence has yet been adduced directly
connecting the defendant with the crime,
and much speculation Is being indulged
â in as to whether the prosecution can
1 identify him as having been one, of those
who shot at Cheyne. or whether it will
! seek a conviction upon evidence showing
1 that he was a member of the miners
union, to which organization the masked
i mob undoubtedly belonged.

The retiring president. E. Oram Lyte,

Said Mr. Lyte to-night: "The meet
i ing compares from an educational

bright. Words cannot describe the
pleasure of the visitors. I have heard
nothing but praise from the thousands
who have spoken to meâ not one single
j complaint, and I was placed where I
i would naturally hear complaints if
1 there were any. Even the weather,
I which seems to have aroused some, ap
prehension among Angelenos, was more
] pleasant than at any meeting for the

1 this was the largest and best attended
. meeting ever held in the history of the

Special Disratch to The Call.
CLOVERDALE, July 15.â T0-day J
marks a new era in the wine industry
of Northern Sonoma. The meeting of }
winegrowers in response to the request
of H. J. Crocker was attended by over
250 vineyardists and winemakers from j
Dry Creek, Geyserville, Cloverdale and
Healdsburg. The large citrus Fair Pa
vilion was well filled with growers,
winemakers and visitors and enthusi
asm ran high. The meeting was organ
ized with E. G. Furber, president, and
George B. Baer, secretary. On opening
the meeting Mr. Furber said: . _..;
"We meet to-day to face new condi
tions, which cannot but alleviate the
hardships and poor prices of former
years. Cloverdale, with her tremen
dous wine resources, will undoubtedly
receive benefits which will be lasting. !
Property will enhance in value and j
farmers will regain the solid footing of
former years. The man responsible for |
the -new conditions and brighter future
is H. J. Crocker, and we are met to
gether to encourage the cause."
P. C. Rossi, president of the Italian- '
Swiss Colony, followed and said: "Mr. {
Crocker intends to establish a good,
fair value. Probably, ln one year prices j
will go up, but past experience shows |
that without organization and solid
control prices will go back to a figure
without profit to growers, manufac- I
turers and retailers. Perhaps the price !
is small, but it is nevertheless a good,
fair price." '
A Sbarboro, the secretary of the '
Italian-Swiss colony, said: "I. heartily I
favor the proposition. It will give value
to vineyard properties. The price is a
third higher than in the past ten years. ]
I believe the same! ratio will continue
the next ten years if the proposition is j
not accepted. I believe Mr. Crocker's ,
object is principally philanthropic and j
hope he will succeed. Farmers should
not be speculators. If Mr. Crocker con- j
trols- the grape crop of California he i
will distribute it among existing wine j
cellars, thus working no . harm to any |
Industry established."
F. Albertson said that "this most lib- !
eral offer will enhance the value of.
vineyards from 30 to 40 per cent, pro- j
viding Mr. Crocker can-control the en- |
tire crop and wine output."
James Mille of Healdsburg declared !
"that the . proposition guaranteed the :
success of the industry, as old condi- '
tions will return unless there is unity !
of action."
"W. Q. Witter of San* Francisco, who I
owns, large vineyards, .'said:-"- "The |
growers here should be satisfied. Few I

Thomas. Smith of Geyserville said he

BRITISH, POSTOFFICE SAVINGS.
/"\NE of the features of the operation of postal
ONE the features of Britain brought postal
savings banks in Great Britain brought out by
N-*^ the discussion of the subject due to the recent
laying of the foundation-stone of the great edifice in
West Kensignton is the effect which the opportunity
for saving has in promoting thrift among all classes of
people. That has been, in fact, the most notable result
of such banks in the United Kingdom, and the evi
dence of it is striking.
According to the- statements given by the Post
master General, the Duke of Norfolk, in his address at
the ceremony, the growth of the institution has been
remarkable. At the end of the first ten years there
were 1.500,000 depositor's, with a balance of .Â£19,000,
--000 to their credit. At the end of twenty years the
figures bad doubled, and now, after thirty-seven years,
there were nearly 8.000,000 depositors, with a balance
of Â£12;-.. 000.000. The number of offices at which de
posits could be made or withdrawn was upward of
12,000. As an illustration of the strong hold which
the institution had gained upon the population, the
Duke said, one out of every five persons in the
United Kingdom is now a depositor. It had been cal
culated that about four-fifths of the depositors be
longed to the working classes.
Such a tremendous increase of business done by the
postal bank would seem to imply a loss of business
to private bankers, or to trustee savings banks.
There has, however, been little or no such loss. The
London Mail, in commenting on the subject, says:
"This increase of postoffice business appears to repre
sent, in large measure at least, a real development of
habits "of thrift among the people, and not a mere
transfer of accounts from one agency of deposit to
another. Some of the older trustee savings banks
have been closed, it is true, but those which survive
are sounder than they ever were, and the total sum
deposited in trustee banks exceeds by several millions
the amount which they held when the postoffice sys
tem was established in 1861."
A further evidence that the postal banks do not
seriously cripple or interfere with private banks is
found in the fact that in Scotland, where there are
large facilities given for popular thrift, there is but
one depositor in the postal bank out of every four
teen, persons in the population, while in England and
Wales, where the facilities for saving through pri
vate bank** are less than in Scotland, there is one de
positor for every five inhabitants.
Considered from every point of view, the .postal
savings banks appear to fill an actual "need of a peo
ple. Where there is an opportunity to save, habits of
thrift will grow; but where no such opportunities
are provided, there will always be waste and want.
A long fight will be required to bring about the es
tablishment of such bank's here, and yet in no coun
try on the globe are they more needed. We have
wide areas of territory where there are no savings
banks at all, and where none are likely to be founded
by private parties. In such districts the temptations
to the wage-earner to spend his wages are many, but
the opportunities "for saving are few. The adminis
tration which establishes. postal banks will confer an
immense benefit upon millions of people.

THE CORONER'S DUTY IN THE NEW
MAN WRECK- ;0f;
rROM the evidence obtained by The Call con
cerning the collision at Newman it appears as
clear as day the disaster cannot be passed over
as an unavoidable accident for which no one is to
blame. The exact amount of responsibility of any
one of the employes of the road involved in the af
fair cannot be fixed until the testimony of all of
them is obtained. Thus far they have kept silent un
der orders from the railroad managers, and will con
tinue to do so unless the law forces them to speak
out. It is for the Coroner of Stanislaus County to
compel them to do so. That is his duty in the New
man wreck.
â  The investigation should be thorough and it
should be comprehensive. It should be confined to
no narrow limits, nor should it be partial or incom
plete. The public canrtot afford to ignore the causes
of grave disasters of this kind, nor permit them to
remain the secrets of a railroad bureau.
In a careful review of the subject yesterday The I
Call pointed out the line of questioning the Coroner
should pursue in order to bring out all the facts of
the case. There are certain features of the disaster
which incline to the belief that the managers, of the
road are not wholly blameless, that their responsi- \
bility may be not less than that of the conductors, j
engineers, brakemen and the station-master at New- j
man. These features of the affair should- be ex- j
ploited as fully as any other. They should not be i
set aside for either fear or favor of the railroad mag
nates.
Among the facts which ought to be brought out
are these: Did the crews of the trains have ample j
time for sleep and rest before they were called out j
to take charge of the trains, or were they overworked
and exhausted? Why was the special train run past
Lathrop, over to Tracy, thence to Fresno via Men- I %
dota, when time and mileage can be saved on a road
going direct from Lathrop to Fresno, and on a line I
over which a train seldom runs at night?
These questions are not irrelevant to the acci
dent." If the trainmen were fagged and exhausted
from overwork it is clear the railway service has
been cut down to an inadequate force, and for that
the managers of the road are certainly responsible.
The course taken by the special is still more impor
tant to the issue. If the special had run from Lathrop.
to Fresno it would have had a clear track from all
trains in either direction from before the time it left
Sacramento until 5:30 a. m. On the Tracy-Men
dota line it was due to meet between i o'clock . at
Tracy and 5 o'clock at Fresno one regular freight.*
two regular passenger and several extras, besides two
tegular freights to overtake and pass.
These and all other questions involved in the dis
aster are for the Coroner to investigate. A great dis
aster has occurred, by which two people have been
killed and thirteen injured. The railroad officials
will of course try to pass it off as unavoidable. The
public looks to the Coroner to fix the blame where
it belongs. That is his duty.
MORGAN'S VIEW OF DEMOCRACY.
SENATOR MORGAN has long been one of the
most fervent of the advocates of the free coin
age.of silver. lie was one of the fiercest of the
foes of Cleveland and one of the most potent of the
Senatorial clique which split the Democratic party
rather than uphold the sound money policy of the
Cleveland administration. Now the old warhorse'
has had enough of cavorting like a wild colt. lie has
become serious again and longs for the harmony of
discipline in the party ranks. . /
The plan of the Senator is ingenious. He desires
to eliminate silver from the Presidential campaign,
but to leave it as an issue in the Congressional dis
tricts. He proposes that the. party nominate for the
Presidency a man who shall be non-committal on the
silver question, but who shall pledge himself to have
no policy to carry out against the will of the people.
As the Senator himself has expressed it, he would
nominate a man who would say to his party some
thing like this: "When my party is able in Congress to
pass a free coinage bill I will hot veto it, but will per
mit it to -become a law. Whatever my own opinions
j may be. I believe the combined wisdom of the men of
!my own party in Congress is better than mine. It
| might be possible that I should not personally think
that a free coinage law was the proper thing to enact,
but if your representatives in Congress believe other
wise, if, in your judgment, such a law will be for the
best interests of the county, such a law when enacted '
by you will stand."
The defection of Morgan from the Bryan camp is
not surprising. He has simply joined the other emi
nent leaders of his party. The Call has repeatedly
pointed out that the leading newspapers in the South
: crn States have been more or less open for some time
past in denouncing the folly of Bryanism. Morgan
I adds his voice to theirs in expressing Southern sen- j
i timent. The South has no silver mines to boom.
; Her statesmen see that in following the silver leaders
I the South has been placed in a false light before the
I country, and h how almost shorn of influence in Con- I
gress. Her politicians perceive that Bryanism is a !
sinking ship and they are ready to abandon it.
In the meantime it is to be noted that the. hold of
Bryan upon the masses of the Democratic party in
the North, at any rate, continues undiminished in
â  strength. That much was demonstrated by the out- ;
I burst of enthusiasm upon the utterance of his name
i at the Fourth of July celebration at Tammany Hall.
! The conservative sense of the leaders of his party in
I every "portion of the Union is against him, but with !
the radicals and the unreflecting masses he remains !
I as unquestionable a leader sis ever.
It appears from the present outlook as if the Demo
cratic convention of 1900 would be even more stormy
than that of 1896. The combination against Bryan
j next year will include almost every leader of the party
I who has a national reputation. He may succeed once j
I more in sweeping the delegates away from the do
; main of, common sense by the power of his oratory, !
I but, if so, the revolt that follows will be far greater [
! thai? that which organized the .Palmer and Buckner j
i movement. It will mean the total separation of the
conservative element from the Democratic party,
lcr.ving the name and the machinery in the hands of
the Populists, whom Democracy once fondly. thought I
j it would swallow as the tiger does the lamb. _
j THE FARMERS AND THE TARIFF- i
EASTERN manufacturers, flushed with the I
abundant prosperity attending their export
trade, have in many instances come to the con
â¢ elusion that a protective tariff is no longer necessary
to their welfare. Their opinion, strangely enough,
seems to be shared to some extent by the Postmaster
General. At any rate, that official has been quoted
as saying in a recent-i nterview on the issues of the
day that a protective tariff is no longer so important
as it. was in times past..
As given by the New York Press, his exact words
j are these: "Protection has established, the complete
I industrial independence of this country. : More, than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, JULY 16, 1899.
that, it may fairly be said that it has substantially es
tablished our industrial supremacy. This truth has
been demonstrated within the past two years, as we
are now beating the products of the Old World on
their own grounds. With this development of our
home industries to the point where they completely
possess the home market and are able also to reach
abroad, the protective issue has not the same vital
force it had during the period of struggle and devel- j
opment." '
It is gratifying to note that our New York con
temporary emphatically repudiates the doctrine thus
set forth and points out that to the farmers of the
country protection is an issue even more important
now than ever. As the Press says: ''To the farmer
whose tobacco fields have just recovered from the
ravages of Sumatran competition, and who sees .them
threatened by Porto Rican, Cuban and Philippine
competition; to the Southern fruit-raiser, whom the
Dingley law has rescued from the ruin of Mediter
ranean oranges in ballast and. now sees the whole
West Indies swim with the ken of rivalry; to the beet
sugar grower, to whom has been held forth the daz
zling prospect of a new $100,000,000 crop and now
has this prospect dimmed by the advocacy of Cuban
annexation by the President's own Commissioner to
Cubaâ -to all these the question of the maintenance
of a protective tariff holds now anxieties which it
never knew before." ,
The experience of the country during the disas
trous days of the Wilson tariff showed the farmers
that their welfare was inseparably connected with that
of the miners and the manufacturers. When the mills
closed the home market of the farmer was diminished
so seriously that the price of all forms of his product
fell, and he suffered as much from the depression as
any other class of the community. The manufac
turers of the East will have a similar costly lesson if,
in pursuit of the export trade, they, should break
down the protection given to American farm
products. Should the prosperity of the agriculturists
be diminished, and their consuming power lessened,
the home market for American manufactures would
be at once so weakened that no export trade now in
sight could make up for the loss.
Protection remains a vital issue. ' The Pennsyl
vania manufacturers, following the lead of Carnegie,
may be inclined to regard it as of no further value,
but the common sense of the people of the country
at large is not likely to make such a mistake. They
will never be willing to sacrifice our fruit, tobacco,
sugar, wine and wool interests either to free trade or
to imperialism.
THE WOMAN'S CONGRESS.
WHILE comparatively little attention has been
' given in cables from Europe to the Interna
tional Congress of Women in London, the
press of England has given no little space to a record
of the proceedings. The assembly has been a no
table one in every respect, for it has been attended
by delegates from every quarter of the globe and rep
resenting every civilized race.
One of the notable features of the Congress has
been the strict decorum enforced at all the. meetings.
| The correspondent of the Manchester Guardian says:
"The proceedings everywhere were businesslike and
serious. Indeed, the feminine influence in the ar
rangements seemed to. show itself in an enthusiasm
; for discipline which developed into a kind of in
j genuous officiousness. Innumerable 'stewards' took
control, and strictly forbade any one to enter or leave
'â¢- a room during a speech. There was a certain pleas
urable reminiscence of early childhood in being or
dered about peremptorily by young ladies of the age
of an average pupil teacher in a national school, but
it proved to be a novel and serious impediment to
journalistic duties to be rigorously forbidden to pass
from one section to another."
The congress has held its meetings in sections, for
the discussion of many topics, but the section meet
, ings are not permitted to pass resolutions. That is
a right reserved to the congress as a whole. It was
noted on the first day, while all the ten section meet
ings were well attended, the "political section," .where
the suffrage question was discussed, drew the smallest
crowd, although, as it turned out, the debates there
were the: liveliest of the day.
The industrial section, in which woman's work and
wages were discussed, proved to be most attractive to
by far the larger number of delegates. The papers
and the discussions that followed showed a good deal
of antagonism and competition between the sexes in
the struggle for employment. It **as asserted by
â  some of the speakers that much of the so-called phil
anthropic legislation ostensibly . devised to prevent
' the overworking of "women in factories was really
caused by the jealousy of men ready to put restric
tions upon the competition of women in the labor
market.
Some of the statements made on the subject by
delegates from different countries are interesting.
i Frau Caver said women in Germany work from ten
to fifteen hours a day in factories and receive much
lower wages than men for the same work. Zeneide
Ivanoff reported that in Russia women work for $5
, a month, and often in the most unhealthy surround
-1 ings. Mme. Belilon of France declared that men in
I all classes and in all civilized nations are striving to
keep remunerative work away from women. The
only delegate who thought women have too much,
work as it is was Mrs. Annie Hicks of the United
States, who maintained that mothers should not be
permitted to work for a certain time after the birth
; of a child, and that there should be a maternity fund
provided by the state.
â¢'â¢ The significant fact of the Congress is that-more
attention was paid -by the delegates to 'economic
than to political questions. Woman's suffrage is less
interesting now than woman's work. Much the
same tone marks the assemblies of men in these
days. We have reached a stage of new development
in economic conditions, and the problems it presents
are the main themes of discussion wherever intelli
gent people meet to consider . the general welfare,
whether they be men or women. 7 '.* 'â 'â / :

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfiUGHT.
Bulwer Lytton in one of his best
known novels undertook to depict "va
rieties of English, life." He made a
good story and presented characters
illustrating no inconsiderable number
of the types of men and women that
; go to make up the complex public of
i England. Each had his peculiarities,
1 and nearly every one of them turned a
crank of some kind as diligently as if
he thought the turning were necessary
to make the world go round.
England is but part of an island and
the varieties of life there are few and
1 simple when contrasted with those of
; the United States. What novelist
i would venture upon depicting varieties
of American life?- It takes a news
| paper to do that, and even. then the
! story has to be continued from day to
' day for years to keep pace with the
{ development of the subject. As for our
! cranks â their name is legion. We have
j almost more cranks than people, for
while many of us are not cranks, there
j is a great host each of whom is- sev
j eral kinds of a crank, and the aggre

computes the amount you spend for
cigars and figures out that If you had

this juncture does not turn in vain.
During the construction of the fa
mous .subway in Boston an old burial
ground was disturbed, and it was found
necessary to remove the remains of a
large number of persons interred there.
Of course such a movement of ances
tral bones caused much agitation in the
stagnant pools of Boston aristocrasy.
One eminent person of culture was in
duced to grant a right of way through
his family vault only upon condition
the city would provide him with an.
other constructed according to his Ideas
for. the reception of the mortal remains
of his ancestors.
The city agreed and the work was
done; ' the subway completed and the
new tomb constructed. When all waÂ»
ready; the thrifty respecter of the bones
of his departed pedigree builders was
taken over to Inspect the new reposi
tory. "Now," said the official who had
charge of the work of removing th_
bodies, "you can set a day and the reÂ«
mains can be brought over and depos
ited here." "What!" exclaimed the old
gentleman,, "have that nice new tomb
littered up with those old bones?
Never! Close up the old tomb and let
'em be!" -Thus did he obtain, without
cost, a new family tomb, and prove
himself so '__ well fitted for it that all
Boston will be glad to â¢ see him oc

Chicago furnishes the time with a
good specimen' of the "get there" citi
zen in the person of the man who, hav
ing read the recent report that the
great wall of China is to be torn down,
at once packed, his grip .and started
to Peking to put in a bid for the con
tract. There is another type of Ameri

which is even more interesting in its
way than the type that means busi

I having : made himself without culture,
. proceeds to patronize literary societies

proudly termed by his admiring fellow

or even a philanthropist who endows
a church out of the proceeds of the
sale of embalmed beef. Under his in
fluence the drawing-room conversation j
and even the club talk of Chicago has
become refined like pure leaf lard, and
a member of the upper set wouldn t
talk of sausages at a soiree for a car
load of sausages.
In this aspiration for self-culture
there is always an audible, expression
of delight from the Chicagoan when
ever he gets a new bit of veneering
over some part of his mental furniture
where the natural grain of ignorance
has been hitherto exposed in the raw.
Hence incidents.
Not long ago a distinguished visitor
went to Chicago and by request deliv
ered a lecture on Omar Khayyam be
fore a 1 very self-selected literary so
ciety. The president of the club sat
on the platform and fairly glowed with
rapture all the evening. From the
brightness of \he face of him a casual
stranger in the audience might have
supposed he had guessed right on
wheat. When the lecture was over,
however, he explained the cause of his
joy. "We are greatly indebted to the
speaker," said he to his fellow self
cultured, "for we never before knew
the difference between Omar Khayyam
and Hunyadi Janos."

The letter-writing crank Is Ã¼biqui
tous and he is as gayly variegated as
a cockatoo. New Tork has a fine speci- j
men of himâ perhaps the finest of the (
summer. He has been ' arrested for
sending love-letters to Miss Helen
Gould, his capture being due to the fact
that, not content with sending many
through the mails, he called at the
house and delivered some of them in
person.
When, called upon by an inquisitive
law to explain his conduct he said he
had read of Miss, Gould's n6ble and
generous actions and thought she mer
ited the love as well as the admiration
of every patriotic American; therefore,
believing that all people who deserve
commendation ought to receive it, he.
had written to express his as best he
could and as often as he could. He
had take*n some letters to the house
himself instead of sending them
through the mails simply because he
had not enough money to buy two certt
postage stamps. He pleaded that his
love is disinterested and pure, and in
proof cited the fact that in none of his
letters had he ever asked Miss Gould
to marry him or to give him a dime.
The argument had a very different i
effect from that intended by the defen
dant. The Judge before whom he was
tried, after giving all the facts due
consideration, came to the conclusion
in his New York judicial mind that a
man who would make loye to an heiress
without expecting money must be
crazy, so he sent the letter-writer to
an asylum, and thus deprived the un
appreciative Miss Gould of the only
disinterested lover she ever had" in her
life, or is ever likely to have.

a place in the list of the varieties oÂ£
our life.
A very good story of their kind has
been made public in some of the remin
iscences of Congressman Bland, which
followed his death a few weeks ago.
Despite their differences in politics
and their many battles on the floor of
the House over questions of tariff or
finance, Bland was a great friend of the
late Nelson Dingley. 'The two men
were very much together for years dur
ing their service in Congress, and the
warmth of their attachment for
one another was frequently noted.
When Dingley died Bland was very
much affected, and it is recalled that j
he said to a friend: "I feel all right
myself just now, and am about as well
as ever, but somehow I am convinced
I shall not survive Dingley a year."
The incident is the more interesting
becatise that is the only time on rec
ord when Bland's convictions were
confirmed by results.

Some cranks are forever trying to
set the courts to grinding out redress
for all mankind and cures for every
thing that irritates! The extension
given of late by the courts to the scopÂ«e
of writs of injunction has greatly en
couraged this type, and there are very
few things that haven't been enjoined
in some part of the Union in the last
few years.
A Texas man heads the list of this
type so far by applying to the court to j
enjoin his wife from receiving the com- I
pany of a certain good-looking neigh- j
bor. If the injunction stick, the busi- j
ness -of courts will largely increase and |
lawyers will have a chance to get rich
though honest. If a wife may by in
junction be restrained from receiving
visits, why may she not be enjoined |
from bargain sales, or from keeping |
lapdogs?

Finally, let ite give heed to the Amer
ican poetâ the singer of the day, who
harps not upon worn-out themes of
love or du^y or beauty or booty, but
of current events, the latest sensa
tions; and who rolls his rapturous
rhapsodies round the records of our
new inventions and our freshest feel- I
ings. Here is how a Boston bard i
twangs his lyre in the Journal of that*|
city and sings of "Horseless Things":
Across the pond In gay Paree
They have the horseless coupe.
But what those Frenchmen need the nioat
Is just the horseless soup.
The horseless cab, the horseless bus.
Is Gotham's fondest hope.
But what old Gotham needs the most
Is just the horseless soap.
Chicago wants the horspless hack,
But then the boarder thinks
That what Chicago needs the most
Is horseless sausage links.

Is Discussed.

Â»
The gentleman named Beamans,
who for political reasons was appointed
adjutant general of the National Guard'of
the State by Dan Burns' political partner,
Henry T. Cage, said in assuming office
that he did not know much about the
National Guard, but would learn. The'
National Guardsmen, in view of certain
things that have transpired of late, de
clare that He has a great deal to burn
and that from his acts of late his term
of four years will not be long enough to
enable him to master what he ought to
know about the guard. His acts have
been the subject of considerable discussion
in National Guard circles, and some of
them border so close on absurdity that
one of the guardsmen said yesterday:
"Why, he's the mule of the guard; but
mule is not the word I ought to use."
He has come to the conclusion that all
the officers who during the Spanish-Amer
ican war did not enter the volunteer ser
vice will have to report for duty, as did
those officers and men who did volunteer..
Ii is- claimed that as these officer- were
never discharged from the service of the
State, and that some of -them have been
in continuous service, being in charge of
companies and regiments or .what.' re
mained of them, and that they were pres
ent at the recent muster and Inspections.
that to make them formally report anew
is a most ridiculous proposition, that will
not lie entertained by any one who knows
anything about military affairs.
Then there is what the guardsmen say
is the '"bad break" he made in connection
with the reception of the Oregon volun
teers In the first place, they say that
the commander-in-chief being away from
the ""beat of government when the Gov- I
ernor of Oregon came here as the com
mander-in-chief of the Oregon National
Guard, that the adjutant general, as his
military representative, should have sent
one of the commander-in-chief's aids., or
two of them, to convey the respects of
their superior officer to" the distinguished
visitor, and in support of this position
they say that if a distinguished visitor
comes to this city and is entitled to recog
nition from the army that Brigadier Gen- I

feral- Shaffer does not on his arrival go in
person to pay his respects, but sends one
of his aids, and that what is correct in
the United States army would certainly
be' correct in the National Guard. But
they say that is one of these matter- of
military etiquette that the adjutant gen
eral has not vet familiarized himself with.
Further they say that the excuse given
for the non-appearance of the adjutant
general's staff when he paraded in -an open,
carriage by his lonely before the Oregort
contingent was that he did not have suffi
cient time to notify his staff, although.,
he had more than twelve hours in 'which |
to do so, and that if he could not get his
staff together in twelve hours in time of
peace they would like to know how long
it would take him to summons it if there
was a call to arms. They say that he
might at least have had one or two of
his aides to accompany him. but that is
another of the many things he will have
to learn. They also would like to know
why he did not ask the division com
mander and the brigadier general of the
second brigade to accompany him on an
occasion of ceremony like that. They are
of the opinion that that was another
thing he has not learned. -â â¢
The uniform hoard held a meeting this
week and pared specifications for
blouses, pantaloons and overcoats to be.

In September- next to be placed on the
retired list and surrender the place that
he has filled to the satisfaction of his su
perior officers and those with whom he
has been associated. The reason for that
move is that the captain's private busi
ness affairs require so much of his time
that he is unable now to give as much
attention as he feels he ought to to the
service. The captain entered the service
of the State' on the 28th of September,
1891 as a man of Company D of the
Nival Battalion, as it was then known,
and he rose to be lieutenant of that com
pany and then became lieutenant com

opportunity to go on a cruise on the

month of August. . In his letter the com

of members . of the California Naval
Militia to encourage them in their
patriotic endeavors -to train them
- selves for effective -work in the navy
should their services Ik? required, by
freely granting them the necessary
leave of absence for this cruise, under
the instructions of competent officers,
without fear of losing the positions by
which they now earn a livelihood.
You will agree with me that patriot
ism should be encouraged in our young
men by all right-thinking citizens, for
it is upon them we must rely in case
i 'of offensive or defensive warfare.
This is the only oportunity that can
be offered the Naval Militia of this
State for sea service, and practice
drills during the present year and the
allotment of the. annual appropriation
by the General Government in aid of
this branch of the service will be made
in accordance with the number of men
who report for duty under this offer,
hence the importance of turning out
as large a force as possible.'
Give the boys a chance to make this

you do so it will create an additional
bond between, you and them and will
redound to your ultimate benefit.

WHAT THE THEATERS
HAVE DONE
DURING THE WEEK.
TO keep apace with all that is go
ing on in the theatrical world we
must be industrious, but happi
ness follows in the path of our
* energies. Think of itâ six attrac
tions and not a dull evening. Getting
up out of our winter idleness in way
I embarrasses us. We have grown ac-
I customed to it. Our brief summer run
in the sunshine makes us feel right
pleasant and mirthful. But, did we
group a year of our- theatrical Julys,
sermons about the evils of running
after enjoyments would be in evidence
and sleep would be an item that might
fit where it could. You cannot bring
us a bowl of good wine and -behoove us
not to drain it. "Lord "and Lady Algy"
is playing to excellent business, and
why not? A second hearing reveals a
cleverness, of line and situation not
thoroughly appreciated at a firstâ light
and shade, I mean, such as we find in
pictures after we have bought them
and brought them home. Lord Algy's
flat, with "pretty much everything in
it that he can't afford," is a worthy ex
travagance. . I wish that all stage man
agers would make a study of Mr. Mil
ler's color harmonies. â¢ 'Tis not a mat->
ter of outlay, but of artistic selection
âa careful avoidance of all ugliness.
The hand of critical refinement is ap
parent and the chairs never mutter at
the sofas. The scenic artist and the
property, man touch the whole* com
munity with their conduct, and he who
j forces makeshift upon us so long as
: we do not openly rebel, engages in but
| small work. Indifference to correct ef
i fects is a bald evidence of managerial
! limitation. Avoidable shocks to the
retina are crimes, and many are the
â  criminals! Lady Algy's gowns, so
j much talked of and admired, -were all
made here; and so, by the way, were
j the ones Miss Roberts wears in "Ca
mille." 'Tis a matter, to congratulate
ourselves upon. Just why "Camille" is
j not to run two weeks I am at a loss to
! say. The business warrants it; the ap
! plause demands it. Five curtain calls
! at the close 'of the third act are not
1 unusual, and tearsâ we fairly luxuriate
in them! 'Tis a pity that earlier con
tracts prevent Mr. Whittlesey's stay
ing as leading man. But the itinerary
is Inexorable.
"The- Last Word" will give place on
Monday night to "The Dancing Girl,"
in. which Miss Bates has been so faÂ»
vorably criticized. The intensity of the
play, its strength of dialogue and its
famous fall have been often discussed;
and the Frawley company find it an
ever popular revival.
The Orpheum has an excellent bill
this week. There is always some dra
matic moment to be found there within
the consciousness of each of us. Miss
Palmer finds her one-act play, "Rose
Pompom," _ an excellent medium for
dainty and clever specialties. Her song
of the tin soldier Could not have been
better done, and her dancing is refined j
and graceful. All the knowledge of
what is funny is not contained in one j
small head, for I cannot yet under
stand the reason of the gales of laugh
ter that greet the coarse horse-play of
"A Wise Guy." The stage that is yet
to come contains our chief interest and
if we like this so much, shall Aye not
be given more and worse? The Rix
fords do their best work vertically,
head to headâ brain to brain, as it
were. Their disrobing act in that poÂ»
sition, if a little startling, is immensely
clever, George Wilson is an inimita
ble monologist. His jokes are new and
j well told; his songs clever and well
sung; his audience merry and generally
appreciative. The tragic comedians
j have found favor,- and new work from
the old people meets deserved applause.
The enterprise of the Grand Opera,
house has won the recognition it de
serves and our theater-going public
j have ceased to find the theater remote â 
!or out of the way. "Carmen" is to be
i followed by "Olivette." The rehearsals
promise much and the theater keeps its
promises.
"Blue Beard" at the Tivoli has been
warmly praised by all the critics ana
the management announces an indefi
nite run. .7:,:
Let him who cannot find food to his
taste on this dramatic table slink away
unpitied to his fate.
CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
California.
To-morrow evening the Frawley Com
pany will put on "The Dancing Girl" at
the California, with Blanche Bates in the
part of Drusilla, the wicked little Quaker
ess. One of San Francisco's warmest
favorites, who has not appeared in "The
Last Word." will in this piece give the
audience a chance to see that Hope Ross,
who made such a hit when she was here
before with Gillette's "Secret Service,"
nas lost none of the magnetism
which belongs to her dainty and charming
little person! Mr. Reynolds is another of
the company who will make his initial
bow to San Francisco play-goers at the
same time.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has four new features for
this week and five hits from last week's
bill. Kilpatrick and Barber head the list
with a sensational bicycle act. Les
Browns, the only one-legged male and j
female acrobats and Instrumentalists on I
earth, promise novel entertainment. Hou- j
dini appears again for one week to refute j
an alleged expose of his handcuff escape.
The holdovers are: The Pasqualis, the
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

I Olympia.
At the Olympia Querita Vincent begins
the last week of her long and most suc
cessful engagement. This is her twenty
seventh weekâ the longest contract ever
filled in a vaudeville house in this city,
and, what is most to her credit, she leaves
a greater favorite than when she started
.in. She has packed the Olympia nightly
and has proved a big drawing card from
her opening week. Among the new acts
this week is the famous La Rose brothers,

DR. KIDMER'S REMEDIES.
DR. KILMER'S SWAMP-ROOT
Is Not Recommended, for Everything.
But If You Have Kidney or Bladder
Trouble It Will Be Found Just
the Remedy You Need.
Kidney .trouble preys upon the mjnd,
discourages and lessens ambition;
beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon
disappear when the kidneys are out of
order or diseased.
Kidney trouble has become so preva
lent that it is not uncommon, for a
child to be born afflicted with weak kid
neys. If the child urinates too often,
if the urine scalds the flesh, or if, when
the child reaches an age when it should
be able to control the passage, and it
is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, de
pend upon it, the cause of the difficulty
is kidney trouble, and the first step
should be toward the treatment of these
important organs. This .unpleasant
trouble is due to a diseased condition
of the kidneys and bladder and not to
a habit as most people suppose.
So we find that women as well as
men are made miserable with kidney
and bladder trouble and both need the
same remedy. The mild and the im
mediate effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It is sold by druggists, in
fifty-cent and one dollar sizes. You
may have a sample bottle by mail free,
also pamphlet telling all about it, In
cluding many of the thousands of tes
timonial letters received from sufferers
cured. In writing Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
Binghamton, N. V.. mention the San
Francisco Daily Call.

LISTLESS GAME

Very Few Hits and
Some Tedious Play.
DONOVAN OUT TEN SECONDS
â â¦ â
RUNS SCORED BY SACRAMENTO
DUE TO ERRORS.
Cold Weather, Slow Work and a Few
Base Hits Characterized the
Came Yesterday After
noon.
â¦â â
"If we don't get there to-day, why. to
morrow will do," was the bacillus that
afflicted the Oakland and Sacramento
teams yesterday. It was easy going for
the men across the bay and they rubbed
it into the Senators while thÂ© band played
a tune called 5 to 2.
The weather was not propitious for
good baseball and perhaps this Is the rea
son for the snail-like pace set at the be
ginning and sustained until the end. Had
Schmeer not made an error in the first
Inning Sacramento wOuld have had a
score of ciphers. Two men were out and
Schmeer threw wild to first. After this
two runs were made by the Senators,
their only materialization during the
game.
O'Connor, from the bad^ State of Texas,
greased the lucky streak' and made first
by Schmeer's wild throw. Another base
belonged to him and he took it. Then
Doyle wielded the stick for a single and
another wild throw by Schmeer pushed
O'Connor over the plate. A hit to right
by Eagan completed Doyle's course
around the bags, an_ the only runs reg
istered by Sacramento were tabulated.
Oakland scored ln the first Inning a sin
gle run, but the third was their particu
lar time to shine, and they shone as if
they were the chief polishers in the
Queen's navy. This inning did not promise
much in run-getting at the outset. Don
ovan was hit by Harvey somewhere in the
kidney region of the back. The Oak
lander wrie-gled a bit and dropped on his
back, going out more than ten seconds.
By the combined life-saving efforts of
his own team and half the Sacramento
stickshakers he was finally revived. He
took his base, stole second and remained
on that bag wh, c Peepies shaped himself
on first base, Sheehan's error being the
cause of it. Then up came Hammond,
who, with a terrible swipe, told Donovan
to move on. "Donny" did and he scored,
while Peepies made a pedestal or second
base. Hutchinson followed with a base
on balls and then a passed ball gave
Peepies another run for. his team.
Hardle hit to a safe clod in center, Ham
mond scoring, while Hutchinson moved
around to third. Dunleavy then took up
the stick and away the spheroid went to
the deepest center field inside the
grounds. He made a two bagger, while
Hutchinson scored. Lange and Schmeer
fanned out and retired their side with
two men on bases. No runs were made
after this Inning. The score:

COURSING AT
INGLESIDE FOR
JUST ONE DAY
Mayor Phelan's Veto
Stops the Sport.
NO BETTING TO BE ALLOWED
â â
SIXTY-SIX RACES OF THE OPEN
STARE ARE RUN.
â¦ â
Judge P. J. Reilly and Slipper Harry
Murray Acquit Themselves
in a Creditable
Manner.
Coursing was resumed at Ingleside Park j
yesterday, on the presumption that ns I
nothing had been heard from Mayor Phe
lan as to the attitude he would assume
on the ordinance recently passed by the
Supervisors he intended it should go
into effect by default. If he neither
signed it nor vetoed it -the measure be
came a law yesterday. His Honor, the
Mayor, is in Yosemite Valley, and his veto
of the measure, did not reach here until
late yesterday afternon..
No betting will be permitted on the
races to-day. Captain of Police Glllen and
his men will be ln attendance but will
probably have nothing to do. as the of
ficers of Ingleside Coursing Club have al
ways obeyed the law when It affected
them heretofore. The stake will undoubt
edly be run through without the betting.
Affairs went on smoothly yesterday,
both the old officials and the new flttins
Into the places as though there had been
no interruption in the sport. P. J. Reilly
gave general satisfaction as judge, while
i Harry Murray as slipper * handled a lot
of untried dogs cleverly. T. J. McHugh,
the veteran field steward, kept matters
on the move, and sixty-six races were
run through in good season. In the early
part of the day the hares did not lead the
dogs far, but during the aiiernoon a num
ber of long courses were run, the- hares
in a number of Instances escaping. Eleven
Spot beat Babe Murphy by 1- to 9 points
after running one minute and twenty
three seconds. Hadiwlst won from Gold
en Russet at odds of " to 1. Charming
May beat Cuckoo and Free and Easy beat
Black Night at the same odds. In the
latter race there was a "no go," in which,
after a hard struggle, the hare escaped.
In both Instances the hare favored Black
Night, but Free and Easy outworked her.

Three Exceptions.
The sport at Union Park was provided
by the rundown of the reserve stake, for
w : hlch forty-eight entries were received.
The hares ran well, at times proving too
fleet of foot for the fastest dogs. The
latter ran true to form, the favorites,
with few exceptions, carrying off the
honors. One of the best courses of the
day Was between St. Elmo and Madge
Wildfire, the former winning. Silent
Treasure and Mialmo also showed great
sport in their meeting, Mialmo winning
after a good course. _
The only shortenders to raise a flag
during the afternoon were Pretender,

The ultra fashionable of San Mateo so
ciety made an otherwise dull and dismal
day bright by their presence. The races
were advertised to start at 2 o'clock, but
it was nearly an hour later' before tne
turnouts of upper swelldom began* pour
ing into the infield. Then they * came.
Victorias, dog-carts, foUr-in-hands, coach
es, brakes, drags and even the old-fash
ioned buck-board. The bleachers were
crowded with the townfolks.
Peter Martin with his coach and party
were the first to create a sensation. As
the prancing steeds caught the strains of
Blanchard's band the leaders began a
cakewalk step that threatened destruc
tion to the bicuspeds of the pole horses.
The fractious animals were . quickly de
tached without Peter losing a portion
of "his smile, even though his guests were
a trifle perturbed. Handsome Frank Caro
lan, wife and party were among the early
arriving ones, and Frank showed to ad
vantage as an admirable whip. By the
way, ho Is secretary of the Hunt Club.
The coach of Mr. Hobart was' located op
posite the judges'' stand and of the gay
crowd occupying seats thereon* "Baby
Hannah" was easily the star.
Joe Tobin was there, wearing the latest
effect in balloon trousering, and so was
W. 08. Macdonough. The latter was
mild-mannered and unostentatious as
ever. Jack Casserly and his pretty wife
were the guests of Mrs. Hobart. E. D.
Beylord swung three horses attached to
a "brake" through a gap no wider than
a kitchen door with an air of dash and
vigor that demonstrated that he was
there with the ribbons.-
In the saddle Charley Dunphy and Wal
ter Hobart were tied for first place hon
ors, each piloting two winners. Mr. Ho
bart, however, had slightly the best of it,
twice finishing second and once third out
of the seven events. ,
The sport commenced" with a quarter
mile dash for ponies that had never won
a race. The Hobart cup was the prize
offered and it was taken by Mr. Hume
astride the speedy Gopher, which won in
a drive, leading Mince Meat out a- neck.
Peter Martin rode, the latter, allowing
himself to be outlinlshed. ' ' '
Then followed a match race at four
furlongs, for $50 a side, between Walter
Hobart's pony Comanche and Yucatan,
a thoroughbred mare. Fred Edwards had
the. mare trained to the hour, and in a
furious drive, well ridden by Mr. Carolan,
she won from the pony by a length. .
The steeplechase for the Moore cup at
two and a half miles, with a Held of four
starting, was the big event of the after
noon. All carried IK pounds, and Ad
Baba with Walter Hobart up disposed of
his company somewhat handily. Hugh
Hume with the leg up on old . Harry
Lewis made a bold bid for It; but was out
classed. Merry Boy ran third. . . . ,< '
The Eyre cup, offered for pony racers
was next decided. The distance was half
a -mile, and Gopher, piloted by Dunphy,
made light of his field, winning* unaffect
edly from Dreyfus. Mr. Hobart danced
into third place with Little Egypt. ,
The Carolan cup, a steeplechase for
ponies at one and a quarter miles, fol
lowed. Again Mr. Dunphy showed his
prowess in the saddle. At the start he
opened a big gap over his field with
Bluphcr and was "away off" from Jubilee,
the mount of OUie Tobin. The winner is
not a pony, and the honors- rightly be
longed to Jubilee. Six-bits, Brandy. Molly
and Nolne finished in the order named.
A novel match race followed. Walter
Hobart sat astride Frank Carolan's
Pinto, while Mr. Carolan guided Hobart's
Guzeba, each owner having previously
wagered his pony the. slowest. Driving
hard, Pinto downed Guzeba half a length,
and the laugh was on Mr. Carolan. - y '
The race for the Hume cup saw Flood
more, the veteran' hurdler, with Walter
Hobart In the saddle, beaten out by a
horse called Bragg, ridden by Mr. Walter.
The latter, weighed In many pounds short
of weight, but Mr. Hobart generously
waved all claims. Blairheart, ridden home
by Dr. Williamson, finished third.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 15. Motorcycles
as pacemakers In bicycle races appar
ently have come to stay. On the track
at Manhattan Beach this afternoon
three noisy machines, whose quick-re
curring, explosions of gasoline reminded
one strongly of a Fourth of July cele
bration, cut out a pace for twenty-five
miles at a rate of about thirty-three
miles to the hour. The middle-distance
riders, trailing these machines, were In
a competition for a purse of $1000 and
a percentage of the gate receipts, but
the four .thousand spectators almost
overlooked the performances o-f the
principals in their eagerness to follow
the trail of the motors. Chiefly because
his petroleum quadruplet possessed
more speed than the naphtha tandems
of his rivals "Harry" Elkes," admit
tedly the cleverest pace follower in
America, finished first in the race by a
margin of a half-mile- over Burns
Pierce and of two miles over Earl
Stevens. His time for the journey was
45:11 3-5, the best time made behind
motor pace in this countrj'.
Throughout the contest the actions of
the motor machines were satisfactory
to the riders and to the spectators,
though undoubtedly both Pierce and
Stevens would have pressed Elkes
closer at the finish had they been paced
by "quads" instead of by tandems. The
only faltering on the part of any of the
machines occurred near the end of the
fourteenth mile, when the motor of the
four-seater ceased its work because of
lack of fuel. Its place was taken by a
tandem, which was in readiness in case
of accident. . â  "* \ - . .*"* â 
Pierce rode ln form that would have
been considered good in any other com
pany hut that of Elkes. Up to ten miles
he made an interesting race, frequently
closing on the leader and sometimes
passing him, only to be repassed. For a
brief third of a mile, ending at the five
miles, he held the lead and then began
to gradually fall away. After the tenth
mile he lost ground more rapidly. Ste
vens, disappointed by his inability to
make use of C. W. Miller's new French
tandem, was paced by the machine
brought over from Europe by Henri
Fournier a year ago. He followed: his
pace closely, but was never a factor in
the contest. . \\; â 
POOL ORDER IS KILLED

Mayor Phelan has vetoed the order re
cently passed by the Board of Super
visors which so amended the anti-pool
selling law as to permit pool selling at all
coursing parks. The , measure, although
general in its scope, was intended for the
relief of the Ingleside Coursing Associa
tion, which was forced to suspend when
the ordinance which closed the race track
went into effect. Mayor -Phelan's objec
tions to the measure are stated in his
message of disapproval; which is as fol
lows: SAN FRANCISCO, July 12, 18997.

purports to in part repeal, pool selling
and bookrnaking on all racing tracks

SOUTHAMPTON, July 15.â rea
son the Shamrock did not sail yester
day, after having made all preparations
to do so, as described in yesterday's
dispatch, was. merely a desire not to
wet her new mainsail. The mechanics
âwhom I described as coming aboard
and going below, as well as their sub
sequent tapping were there to make
necessary preparations for girders
which will be placed inside the yacht
for the voyage.
This morning, however, at 10 o'clock
the Shamrock had her jib and trysail
set and was ready and waiting for Sir
Thomas Lipton. The moment he board
ed her her anchor was weighed and she
went very gently down Southampton
water, followed by the Satanita, under
short sail. In front of Netley Hospital
the Shamrock went about, head to
wind, and this time her great mainsail
was set without any uiiftculty. This
operation was performed right under
the guardshlp Australia, whose officers
and men got a fine view of the yacht.
There was not wind enough to blow out
the Royal Ulster Club's pennant, which
was hauled at her peak. She scarcely
moved. Then for the first time the
jackyards topsail was set, as pretty a
piece of canvas as one would want to
see. The wind failing, a tug took the
yacht in tow as far as Brambles,
where a wind of a wholesale order was
speedily forthcoming from the north
west.
To begin with on. this the Shamrock
started on a westerly course ln fine
style. She was close hauled and jibed
around, fetching Cowes Road on the
port tack. She went about and re
turned on the starboard tack. Then she
hove to and took aboard Ratsey, her
sailmaker. Fife was there already. The
wind had now shifted a point to due
west and had more power in it. This
gave the challenger a dead beat toward
Needles in a choppy seaâ just what she
wanted. It thoroughly blew out the
sails.
In this beating the Shamrock showed
palpably the great depth of her keel.
Her capacity to windward is i un
doubted. On that point to-day she
showed herself a clinker, and a stiff
boat. In close hauled tacking she will
be difficult to beat. Having sailed over
Queen's course, the Shamrock routed
west a full hour, then back to Cowes.
The scene there was a remarkable
one. Aged people who had never
showed themselves for years turned out
on crutches and in chairs. There was

pecially on the way she travels wiU_
a fair wind, but It was quite Impossi
ble to judge her full capacity until she
has been seen with all sails set. It was
noticed that the yacht splashed mora
water in traveling to-day than on her,
first spin. ;-' . ' :
At Cowes the Shamrock passed di
rectly behind the Britannia and tha
contrast was striking. The Prince of
"Wales' cutter looked quite small
against the Shamrock, the latter^ top
mast towering over the Britannia's. fa-
There was a beat back from Nab
lightship and a clean reach home up
Southampton water. She was a very
fetching picture as she approached her
anchorage, the setting sun lighting up
her emerald green sides.
It is stated the Kaiser has been re
quested to allow Captain Parker to sail
the Meteor on Tuesday, there being &
doubt concerning the Britannia's capa
bilities after lying for two seasons in
the mud. whereas the Meteor comes
fresh from her racing at Kiel.
Probably you will receive news that
the Shamrock had an accident on her
spin to-day. The report originated at
Cowes, and is to the effect that the
Shamrock carried away her mainsail.
A member of the Royal Thames Yacht
Club, whom I met in Cowes this after
noon, was the center of attraction. He
asserted that in looking with a tele
scope from the club window he distinct
ly saw the peak gaff of the Shamrock
i and then the whole mainsail give way.
In a few minutes all Cowes was talk
ing about the catastrophe. Many
persons said, "I told you so; I knew
her rigging was too light." etc. The
news was telegraphed and appears
here in large type in the evening pa
! pers, with large headings, "Mishap in
the Solent. Mainsail Carried Away."
Of course all that was terrible. Peo
ple began discussing whether the hull
had not been damaged, as of course it
would have been had the halyards
given way. The truth is nothing hap
pened at all. Nothing gave way. The
Shamrock had no accident of any kind.

Association of American Agricultural

in inspecting the resources of Califor
nia concluded their tour here this after
noon, and left for San Francisco, tired
but greatly impressed, by all that had
been shown them. The special train
with the delegates reacted here shortly
after 2 o'clock. The visitors were
shown through the mammoth beet su
gar plant of the Spreckels Sugar Com
pany by its superintendent, W. C.
Waters. The factory will be ready to
begin operations early in September
and will have a capacity of 3000 tons
of sugar a day. It is the most thor
oughly equipped plant of its kind ln
the world, and was built at a cost ex
ceeding $1,000,000.
The agriculturists enjoyed some of
the beauties of Del Monte before leav
ing that famous resort. They were
driven over the seventeen-mile drive.
The old town of Monterey was visited
and its points of interest shown the
visitors.
Many of the delegates will leave for
their respective homes next week, but
a number will remain in the State for
some time for the purpose of visiting

SALMON PACK A FAILURE.
Year's Output From the Columbia
Far Below the Average.
ASTORIA, Or.. July 15.â Three months
of the four constituting the fishing sea
son have passed and thus far the salmon
pack has been a failure. The run of fish
has been fair at short intervals, but as
a whole the season has been a disappoint
ment. The scarcity of salmon is due to
the high water which has prevailed. The
river Is now failing rapidly and salmon
may yet become plentiful enough to bring
.the already short pack up to the average,
although this is extremely unlikely.
One condition which has tended to less
en the pack has been the great amount of
fish handled by the cold storage com
?anies. They receive a much better price
or their flan, which are delivered fresh
â  â â â  Eastern and foreign markets, than do
the canners. and have paid a price to
the fishermen that has materially cut
into the packers' supply, â  .
The estimated total park to date is 188,-.
200 cases, of which the canners'. combine
has packed 62.000 cases. The pack is!
75.000 cases short- of that of I*9B and 200
cases short of that of two years ago.
This year's pack, from present Indica
tions, will be 125.000 cases short.

SAN RAFAEL, July 15.â The immense
passenger traffic on the line of the North
Pacific Coast Railway owing to the in

a summer resort has led the officials of
that company to a determination to add
to their facilities for transportation. The
first step villi be the purchase of several
new passenger cars to be placed on the
route between San Rafael and Sausalito.
but the most important proposition now
under consideration is the building of a

COMMENT ON HIS TELEGRAM
c .
HIS MAJESTY'S UTTERANCES
VARIOUSLY INTERPRETED.
â¢ â -
One Journal Regards Them as an In
dication That the Imperial Gov
ernment Is Trying to Fol
low Bismarck's Policy.
Copyrighted, 1???, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN", July 13.â Emperor Wil
liam's telegram to Dr. Hlnspeter, the ;
; former tutor of his Majesty, furnishes j
; the press with welcome relief from the
midsummer dullness. Hi^ Majesty's as
sertion of his unshaken determination
| to continue in spite of all resistance in
the way he considers right is generally j
I interpreted as referring to the antl- ,
! strike bill, but it is not believed the I
! Emperor's word will help the measure,
I which all aeree is buried beyond hop*Â»
|of resurrection. The telegram has not !
I been well received outside of the con
; servative press. It is generally consid
! ered another of his Majesty's unfortu
j nate meddling with party politic?.
The Pan-German Deutsche Zeitung
regrets the telegram, while sympathiz- â 
: ing with its object, and asks why the
responsible Ministers do not tako such
I work off the Emperor's shoulders. It j
also questions whether the present ut
terances of his Majesty tend to pro- j
j mote the interests of the bill, and de- !
' nies that these utterances promote the
wr-lfare <>f the monarchy.
The Conservative Post regards the
telegram as a symptom of the Imperial
Government being determined not to
leave the path the late Prince Bis
marck followed in dealing with labor
and social question?.
The National Zeitung calls the tele
gram a purely personal and private ut
terance.
The Tac-eblatt attempts to emphasize
this view by printing the telegram un- |
der the heading of court news, and af- i
' fects to regard it as of no political Im- !
i portance and as sent from the imperial ,
I yacht without the presence of a respon
! sible Minister.
The Socialist press at once seized
! upon the telegram as excellent agita
tion material for the Social Democracy.
The Voerwarts regards it as the Em
peror's answer to the Reichstag vote
on the anti-strike bill, adding: "The
Emperor has not been convinced by
the sentiments of the people, and is fol
! lowing aims to which the people are
! passionately opposed and which even
I the Ministry are unwilling to indorse."
The Voerwarts also interprets the mi
i cident as showing that the struggle
! against the bill has only begun, and
I says {hat his Majesty's words have I
\ "produced waves in the stream of con- !
; stitutional life which will not soon dis
appear." __^__________

BANKS FIGHTING
TO ESCAPE TAXES
Injunction Granted D.
O. Mills & Co.
. â â¦ â
REGARDED . AS A TEST CASE
. "_, â â¦ â
ATTEMPT TO BODGE STOCK AS
SESSMENTS.
It Is Claimed That the Law Passed
by the Recent Legislature
Is Retroactive and
Void.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 15.â A suit was
j filed in the Superior Court this after
noon, which is of Interest to every
! holder of national bank stock in the
State, and which, if successful, will
permit of a large amount of property
escaping taxation. Heretofore in Cali
fornia national bank stock has been
held to be non-assessable owing to the
absence of a State law. Other States
jin which the proper law had been
' enacted assessed this stock and col
! lected taxes on it right along.
The last Legislature, wishing to place
California in the category of States
which collected taxes on. this class of
property, passed a law on March 14
making national bank stock assessable.
Holders of stock in the national bank
of D. O. Mills & Co. in this city claimed
that the act of March 14 was retro
active, inasmuch as it attempted to
make assessable property held on
March 1 which was not assessable at
that time. They claimed that if f the
bank officials paid their taxes on this
property they would hold them respon
sible and sue the officials for recovery
of the amount paid.
In view of this threat on the part of
the stockholders the bank of D. O. Mills
& Co. has brought suit in the Superior
Court against County Assessor Berkey,
| asking for an injunction restraining
! him from taking the bank's money to
' pay the taxes on the stock held by the
| stockholders. A temporary injunction
I has been issued.
The act making national bank stock
j assessable, chapter 80, became a law
j under the constitutional provision with
out the Governor's approval on March
14, 1899.
TEST OF MEXICAN
EXTRADITION TREATY
Technical Points Involved in the At
tempt to Bring Back an
Outlaw.
AUSTIN*. Tex., July 15.â John Kee
ton, who is in jail in Juarez, Mexico,
awaiting extradition on the charge of
having been an accomplice in the rob
bery of a Texas and Pacific Railroad
train and the killing of the fireman in
Coleman County. Texas, over a year
ago, still has a chance to gain his lib
erty. The Mexican Government has
given the Texas authorities until July
28 to prove their case, and unless the
necessary papers are in shape by that
time the prisoner probably will be re
leased from custody.
The Mexican authorities still main
tain that under the provisions of the
new treaty an accomplice in a crime
cannot be extradited, but it is likely
that the point will be waived In this
case, a request having been made that
there be furnished them a certified copy
of the conviction record of the other
murderers of the band, who received
penitentiary sentences in Coleman
County. It Is said Keeton has friends
in Mexico who are aiding him in his
fight against extradition.
The outcome of the case depends to
some extent on the result of the action
of the United States Government on the
application for the extradition of Mrs.
John D. Rich, in jail at El Paso
charged with the murder of her hus
band in Juarez. These two cases are
of extraordinary interest by reason of
the fact that they are the first to arise
since the new treaty went into effect,
and some intricate points are to be de.
termlned by their results.
PUTS A STOP TO ALL
RIVER IMPROVEMENTS
Supreme Court to Decide That the
Office of Public Works Com
missioner Has Lapsed.
WOODLAND, July 15.â Information has
been received by means of what is con
sidered a straight tip that as a result of
wrestling with conflicting and confusing
legislation affecting the office of Commis
sioner of Public Works the Supreme Court
will soon render a decision holding that,
owing to a blunder of the Legislature,
the office has lapsed. The effect of the
decision will be to put a stop to all river
improvements under the direction of the
commissioner and the auditing board and
to render -unavailable for the purposes for
which it was appropriated an unexpended
balance of nearly $180,000 in the fund.
Such a decision will be regarded by the
farming and horticultural interests along
the rivers of the State as But little short
of a public calamity. The government
engineers have testified that the depart
ment of public works has accomplished
the maximum of results at a minimum
cost; but much of this good work, for
lack of proper attention from some one
authorized to maintain and keep it in
repair, may be irreparably damaged be
fore the Legislature meets again. The
forecast of the decision is 'regarded as so
reliable that George Randle, assistant en
gineer of the department, has written a
letter to the commissioner tendering his
resignation. He has accepted an offer
from the McÃride Sugar Company and
will soon leave for the Sandwich Islands
to develop an irrigation system on the
island of Kauai.

The fire department was called together

Levison says he simply reported the sud

At the bereaved home then was much
surprise that the death had been reported
as a suicide. Miss Parker, accord to
her _-.;. was a sufferer from neural
gia of the heart, and her death, though
unlocked for, was not altogether unex
pected
The conflicting theories of the family
of the dead girl and the misunderstood
message made it nccessar. to hold an
autopsy. Dr. Levison Is totally at. a loss
to account for the way his message was
misunderstood. "3 have been Miss Par
ker's physician for more than three
years," said the doctor, "and so thus
morning when she was taken ill I was
naturally sent for. When 1 arrived at
the residence the girl was dead. 1 made
no examination of the body. It was not
a ease for the phvsieian but for the Cor
oner." Dr. Levison said that though Miss
Parker had of recent years passed
through several serious illnesses, she was
a robust, healthy young woman. "I did
not know she had heart trouble.' said
the doctor. "I never examined her for
heart trouble." 7. , .
- A strange coincidence in relation to
Miss Parker's death Is the death of her
father, which occurred just ten years

GOVERNOR GEER AND STAFF
RETURN TO PORTLAND.
Farewell Reception Tendered th.
Webfoot Executive and Party
by Representatives of
California.
Governor Geer and staff have returned
to Oregon, but the brave soldier boys of
the Second Oregon Volunteers will remain
for several weeks longer before being
mustered out of the service of Uncle Sam,
in which they have won so much distinc
tion and honor, before being permitted to
return to the peaceful pursuits from
which they were called to defend the hon
or of their country. During these few
weeks the Wcbfoot fighters will practi
cally be the guests of the city, which is j
proud to do them honor. The formal fea
tures of their entertainment .have been at
tended to, but they have'by no means ex
hausted the hospitality of the citizens of
San Francisco, as they are rapidly be-
I coming aware.
Yesterday was devoted principally to
I getting settled in camp and getting paid
off, but one event in the course of the
day caused the veterans to swell with
conscious pride, and that was a formal
recognition by President McKinley of
their splendid services in the Philippines.
The order was made public in a circular
issued by headquarters Department of
California in the afternoon. It was ex
ceedingly complimentary in tone and con
tains the information that the President
will recommend to Congress that a medal
of honor be presented to all the members
of the Eighth Army Corps, to which they
belonged.

By direction of the Secretary of ; War, the following is published for <j,
the information of the Second Oregon Volunteers and United States *
Signal Corps Volunteers recently returned from the -Philippine Islands â  *
and now awaiting muster out* at the Presidio of San Francisco. <Â»
"The President desires to express in the most public manner his ap- T

campaigns and battles against the insurgents in Luzon, when under the <Â£
term of their enlistment they would have been entitled to discharge *
upon the ratification of the treaty of peace 'with Spain. This action on *
their part was noble and heroic. It will sound forth as an example of: <s>

the American soldiers. 'â :â ;.*

The camp of the Oregonians on the Pre
sidio reservation swarmed with visitors
all day, notwithstanding the brisk wind
and the refusal of the sun to shine bright
ly. All were welcomed, and the soldiers
told and retold of the campaigns in the
far away islands that' brought glory to
the American arms and honor to the nar
rators. The event of the morning was the
advent of two paymasters. Majors Recce
and Downing, who liquidated the claims
of officers and privates for two months'
salary. Each private received $31 20 and
the officers from $223 50 to $750, over $40.
--000 being disbursed before the noon hour.
The major portion of this money will in
all probability be spent In San Francisco,
for the "- soldiers have been away from
home a long time and they enjoy spending
money. *
At noon the forty soldiers who were on
duty as a camp guard Friday night while
their comrades were being feted In the
city were given twenty-four hours' leave,

make good use of their. time. .The volun

i bring together the largest body of rifle

every Turner organization has its rifle
shooting section. This year the main
gathering will be at Glen Park, and for
two daya the ride reports will be equal
Ito a Filipino battle. There are to be
other features, such as prize singing, ath

est centers about the shooting for cash
prizes on the rifle range. The Glen Park
management is fitting up a LtW-yard range,
which will have ten targets, with the cor
responding shooting stands and other
necessaries for shooting.
Captain Fred Attinger was selected to

The mix-up in Democratic local politics
vexes the soul of Jimmie Phelan. Law
rence, Rainey, Greaney and Maxwell are
the busiest bodies in the town. Lawrence,
as a schemer to put Phelan in a bad hole,
is only equaled by Eddy Greaney as a
talker and bettor. The other day at the
"cabinet," in the presence of a dozen by
standers, Greaney proclaimed that the
Rainey ticket in the Thirty-eighth Dis
trict would be elected. Wesley Reed dis
sented, expressing the opinion that the
regular ticket, backed by the Committee
of One Hundred, would win out. Greaney
replied that Lawrence and the Examiner
would support the Rainey ticket, and ot
fered to bet $20 that the ticket would
win. Wesley Reed, who fancied that there
was more wind than wisdom in the Law
rence-Rainey combine, took the bet and
covered the money on the spot.
Democratic politicians who are in posi
tion to know what is going on behind the
scenes openly assert that Lawrence has
gone Into the bossing business and lias
promised positions all along the line. Lso
la is mentioned for Sheriff, but should the
machine slip a cog and throw Esola out
the office of Chief of Police will be given
to him through Rainey influence with the
new Board of Police Commissioners.
Mayor Phelan is expected to accept the
Lawrence programme and submit to the
Rainey dictation. Phelan's distress is not
concealed from the managers of the com
mittee of One Hundred.
It is recognized that Rainey and Buck
lev have recruited a strong following of
independent Democrats, and should a deal
be brought about to unite the independ
ents the control of the municipal conven
tion might be wrested from the One Hun
dred. The chief manipulators in the Com
mittee of One Hundred have prepared a
harmony pudding, which is offered to the
clubs. The plan to promote harmony is
to Allow the Assembly district clubs to
appoint six men from each district â or
10$ from the eighteen Assembly districts.
These are to be admitted to the general
Committee of One Hundred, increasing
the governing body to 208. To prevent
bad men from creeping in, Joseph Mc-
Donald is to inspect the reinforcement of
six from each district before enrollment
In the general committee. Lawrence
heard of this proposition yesterday and at
once suspected that Gavin McNa"b would
be looking over Joseph McDonald's shoul
der when the additional names were under
review. Lawrence, Rainey and Greaney
are for harmony, but they want that kind
of harmony which consists of harmonious
consent for Rainey to name the ticket for
the convention and to name the Commis
sioners to he appointed by the Mayor un
der the new charter. Phelan wants peace
and harmony. He prefers that all the
discontented elements should unite under
the banner of the so-called regular or
ganization of One Hundred, and give him
the nomination without exacting pledges
relating to the appointment of Fire and
Police Commissioners.
The plan to increase the general com
mittee suits Phelan, but it does not please
Rainey. If Lawrence could go over the
list and check off the good and bad along
With McDonald and McNab the plan
might suit the Rainey end of the body

threatens a smash of the Lawrence slate.

IT OPPOSES ST. MARY'S PARK.
, -
Mission Federation of Improvement
Clubs Objects to Buying Property.
The Mission Federation of Improvement
Clubs at a meeting held last night at the
office of Dr. E. N. Torello. 4263 Mission
street, discussed improvements and tax
levy matters with the result that it event
ually placed itself on record as being op
posed to the purchase of St. Mary s Park
or any other private property for park
purposes so long as the city has its own
parks unimproved. . ', *,
A S. Lillie started the resolution
a-rolling by introducing the following:
"Resolved, That as taxpayers we would
suggest to the Merchants' Association
that in their report on the tax levy com
parisons be made of the expenditures, re
ceipts and number of employes of each
municipal department, and the amount of
business transacted, so that we may
know the proportion of increase of our
taxes with the growth of business and
population of our city. We believe the
comparisons should be made for three pe
riods, namely, the fiscal years 1880-00,
1894-95 and the present fiscal year 1899-1900.
Such a report will, in our opinion, show
plainly that the great bulk of the tax
payers' money is being absorbed by the
taxeaters. and that their number has
been increased much faster than neces
sary.- It, will also make plain the fact
that our city government can be run on
the $1 limit and still have plenty of money
for permanent improvements."
; Gus Schnee, chairman of the executive
' committee, introduced a resolution touch
ing the. purchase of private property for.
park purposes as follows:, iv ,-.: -",--..
"Resolved, That the Federation of Mis
sion Improvement Clubs protests against
the purchase of , St. Mary's Park
or other private â¢ property for such pur
poses, and reminds the Supervisors that
the city owns many unimproved parks in
the southern portion of the city which
should be beautified in preference to buy
ing other property." "... ;'_â¢",'-â¢' '^\*. :..
A motion was adopted Instructing the
secretary to notify the Supervisors that
it is the wish of the federation that ane
electric lights which were .removed from
the Mission outlying districts.be replaced
as soon as possible, as the sections from
which these lights have been taken â¢ are
now in a condition, of * darkness.
Dr. Torello brought the question of the
pound limits before the federation for
its consideration. He stated that one of
the reasons why property owners in the
outlying districts would, not improve
their homes by the planting of flowers and
shrubs was that no sooner . were such
adornments planted in the gardens than
they would be eaten up by rambling
goats and cows; On his representation of
this evil the federation indorsed â  the ac
tion of the Committee of Health and Po
lice of the Supervisors, which 'body rec
ommended the extension of the pound
limits to the county line.
.Having disposed of the improvement
question the federation took up the com
ing' political contest- and unanimously
pledged itself and its members to sup
port morally and financially such candi
dates as will favor improvements in the
Mission district. It was suggested by
several of the delegates that the Mission
should have; at least six - out of the
eighteen Supervisors to be elected.

SCENE UPON SCENE IN
NAVY DIVORCE SCANDAL
Elizabeth Lung Lands Her Fist on
Detective True's Face.
Threatens to Kill Him for His Alleged Persecution.
Philadelphia's Surgeon Gives Way to His
Emotion.
A savage assault by Mrs. Elizabeth |
Lung upon the person of Ben True, an
ex-railroad detective, in the corridor out
side of Judge Murasky'a courtroom, the
subsequent hysteria of the assailant, the.
retreat of the assaulted, the silent weep-;
ing of Surgeon Lung, a man hardened to
the scenes of battle and a veteran of do
mestic, fury, the discomfiture of the court ;
and the excitement of opposing lawyers
marked an unusual chapter in the divorce
scandal of the navy yesterday morning.
It may be the woman's nature, but
those who know her say that Mrs. Lung's j
reason is on the. verge of toppling through
her sorrows, her life of woe. Yesterday
morning shortly after 10 o'clock Judge
Murasky took the bench to continue the :
hearing of the action for divorce insti
tuted by Dr. Lung against his handsome j
wife. The principals of the action were
not in court, but from the corridor the
Bound of scuffle and the sharp threats of i
a woman's voice startled the lawyers and
Judge. The door swung open, and op- ;
posite, leaning against a door, his hands j
up to shield his face, stood Detective True.
In front of the detective stood Mrs. Lung,
her clenched lists cleaving the air around j
his face, awaiting a chance to land. Final- !
ly there was the sound of a fist's impact j
upon the face of the retreating detective, j
and Mrs. Lung whirled around and start
ed toward the court. Reaching the door
she turned, and facing the detective said:
"I'll kill you; I'll fix you for what you
have done. You have hounded me long
enough; l can stand it no longer." Then"/'
throwing her arms above her head, Mrs.
Lung, her eyes blazing with indignation :
and suppressed emotion, in fact a dramat- !
ie picture! hurried down the aisle of the i
courtroom toward the bench, and shout
ed, addressing no one in -particular: "He
has bounded me, hounded me. hounded
me. He is wearing out my life. I can
stand it no longer."
Then the spasmodic crying and laugh- i
ITS LABORS ENDED.
After a Final Quarrel the Fourth of
July Committee Adjourns
Sine Die.
The executive board of the Fourth of !
July committee met last night In . the I
Grand Hotel and after a short but stormy j
session adjourned sine die. There was ;
â¢barely a quorum in the room when Presi- !
dent Fletcher dropped his gavel and the
rapping for order had hardly died away
when the wrangling commenced.
None of the old sores were opened, but
the committeemen quarreled at every
â¢proposition broached. The report of the
auditing committee was first taken up
and the bickerings began before the first
item had been read. A bright member of
the committee could not understand why
bills which had been ordered paid at the
.last nee ting should not be discussed all
over again and the harder Chairman
Fletcher tried to explain matters the more
obstinate he grew until finally a sharp
call-down quieted him.
The. report of the auditing committee
showed that a balance of $15 still remains
to the credit of the committee. The re
gatta committee owes bills aggregating
$20 and it was moved that the surplus be ;
turned over to this committee to aid it in I
settling Its accounts. This was the signal
for another wrangle and the motion was
finally voted down.
By this time the committeemen had be
come cooler! off. They realized that it
was their last meeting together as a com- !
mittee and petty differences were burled
under a mountain of complimentary reso
lutions. Members who had persuaded i
creditors to reduce their bills were ,
thanked, the creditors who had cut off
ing of the unfortunate woman marked the
complete collapse of her nervous system, i
She was about to faint when Attorney
George D. Collins, her counsel, assisted
her to a chair. Resoratives were pro
cured but as several minutes passed and
she showed no signs of improvement
Judge Murasky was forced to adjourn .
court. About an hour and a half later
she had so recovered that the trial could
proceed and Judge Murasky again took '
the bench.
During the excitement True, the victim
of Mrs. Dung's assault, had fled the build
ing. Whether he returned later or not Is
not known, but in any event he was not [
much in evidence.
Dr. Dung again took the stand to finish :
his story and it was then that the sad
facts leading up to the action for divorce
became known. Dr. Lung told his various
stories of the many times his wife had
compromised him through her intemper- ;
ance, naming dates and places. In refer- 'â¢
ring to an Incident among the many which i
occurred at Port Royal on the Atlantic 1
Coast, in which he said his wife had been j ;
particularly offensive in her actions, he ;
broke down. The tears rolled down his [ <
cheeks and he asked the court for a few : ;
moments in which to compose himself.
The court simply bowed and for some I ;
minutes Dr. Lung gave way to his emo- ! '.
tions. At this demonstration of emotion ! ;
Mrs. Lung, too, broke down and during ' '.
the rest of the afternoon she sat silently ; ;
weeping. At times husband and wife '
would look at each other reproachfully, ;
but there was no sign of enmity \on their ;
faces and from this the officers of the j ',
court, whose sympathies are with both ] '
the unhappy litigants, hope to see a re- : '
conciliation, but the pride of a naval offi- ' '<
cer must be consideredâ and he is not less ',
proud than his wifeâ so even though the Â«
court should refuse to grant a decree as ! ;
prayed it seems that a life apart will .
ever be their lot.
their profits were thanked and a vote of
thanks was extended to the chairman, the
secretary, the treasurer, the auditing
committee and every one else whose name
could conveniently be rung in. A motion
to adjourn then prevailed and the com
mittee which, as Colonel T. J. Robinson
expressed it. "has given San Francisco a
celebration second to none ever held in
the city" passed Into history.

Captain Gillin investigated the complaint
and found it to be correct so far as Dr.

It was explained by the physician that

as the body had been embalmed no evil
effects would be likely to arise from its
presence in his room. The matter was

BIG CAKEWALK CARNIVAL
IN MECHANICS' PAVILION
Â£-_.. >HE great International Cake
walk Carnival is a splendid re
ality. It burst upon the aston
<L> ished gaze of over five thousand
people in Mechanics' Pavilion
last night, amazed the assembled
multitude with the magnificence of the
grand pageant which marked its being
and delighted the throngs of specta
tors throughout the evening by the
wonderful variety and brilliancy of the
innumerable special features it con
tained, and created at once an enthusi
astic appreciation which promises well
for the attendance at the novel and
entrancing spectacle during the com

SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE SHOW.
ing week. The elite of San Francisco
society was there. They came hopeful
of seeing a show worth the trouble
they were put to and yet doubting the
fulfillment of all that had been prom
ised them. They departed satisfied that
the promises of the management had
been more than redeemed and wonder
ing how so much talent could be gath
ered together in; such a comparatively
brie, time. '.',.,.â¢;â¢-
It is no exaggeration to say that the
carnival j is the greatest thing of the
kind ever presented for the delecta
tion of the people of San Francisco.
Its success was assured from the mo
ment the procession of stars made its
appearance on the floor, and every
Succeeding moment but increased the
favorable impression then produced.
The pageant of the three hundred
handsomely costumed cakewalkers/ to
gether with the accompanying floats
and the various other features which
added to the beauty of the spectacle,
was wonderfully attractive. The pro
cession was led by Miss Pearl Hick
man as chief drum major, and, right
here let it be said that Miss Hickman
is a star of the * first magnitude.
Petite in form but perfectly propor
tioned and the personification of grace,
and..- costumed in dazzling attire, she
caught the eye of the audience at once
and was applauded to the echo.. She is
a past master of the art of cakewalk
ing, and as she marched at the- head
of the brilliant throng of professionals
and amateurs she seemed to realize
that she had a reputation to uphold.
That she fulfilled her duty the ap
plause of the great audience is suffi
cient proof.
Immediately behind her came the
retinue of the king and queen of the
carnival, followed by their majesties
seated in a gorgeous chariot. The
royal purple was worn with becoming
dignity by J. R. Allen and Miss Annie
Kennedy. After them came the juven
ile cakewalkers led by a midget drum
major in the person of Miss Marie
Nichols. Then came little Addle Weg
ener driving six cocker spaniels and
followed by a float representing the
birth of the Cakewalk. This was a
cabin in front of which the family of
an ante-bellum plantation darky was
enjoying Itself with exhibitions of
fancy walking by its numerous mem
bers.
Next came the hordes of cakewalkers
in a great variety of costumes, ranging
from the magnificent to the grotesque,
and another float representing the
Cakewalk up to date.
The procession was divided into nu
merous divisions, each accompanied by
harlequins. Bedouins. . Rough Riders
and innumerable strangely attired
promenadofs. After making a circuit
of the hall the chariot containing the
royal pair halted before a bespangled
throne and the king and queen alight
ed. They took their seats on the dais
and the procession moved on in review.

the half a thousand cakewalkers, each

Two girls. Lillie Barrett and â  Mary
Daly, prevented what might have been
a serious conflagration in the drygoods
house of J. J. O'Brien & Co. yesterday
morning. _For several minutes they bat
tled with"a blaze which 'was "started in
the sewing and repairing room by the
careless handling of . benzine.
A cash boy who was sent to polish the
zinc.over a heating stove used rags sat
urated with benzine for the purpose. Soon
after he commenced his task there was
a burst of â  flame and- the boy threw the
rags on the door directly under some
clothing suspended from hooks on the
wall. 'The clothing took fire and the two
young ladies, realizing the danger, seized'
buckets of -.water which they threw : on
the flames. They afterward suffocated
the blaze with other clothing. The sight
of smoke pulling out of the room caused
consternation for a few moments among
the employes, hut the excitement was
soon quelled. Little damage was done.

couple giving continuous exhibitions of
their respective talents, was an attrac
tive sight. Not the least pleasing of
this portion of the evening's entertain
ment was the group of Chinese who
brought up the rear of the fancy step
pers. This is probably the initial ap
pearance of Chinese as participants in
a cakewalk. and their efforts to Imitate
their white associates were humorous
in the extreme. All classes of cake
walkers ' were represented In the pa
geant. Professional cakewalkers, so
ciety cakewalkers. juvenile cakewalk
ers. grotesque cakewalkers, colored
cakewalkers, "specialty" cakewalkers
and ordinary amateurs all were there
and all were doing their best to attract
attention to themselves with gratify
ing success.
But all good things come to an end
and .the pageant gradually melted
away as the various divisions made
their farewell bows to the enthroned
couple and withdrew from the floor.
In this instance however, it was sim
ply withdrawing one good thing to
make room for another. Manager
Buckley announced the terms of the
various contests, and after a brief in
terval sixteen couples of professionals
made their appearance to compete for
the honors of their class. They were
escorted to the center of the floor by
Chief Drum 'Major Miss Hickman,
whose appearance was the signal for
another burst of applause, and the real
business of the carnival was at last
under full sway. For the next two
hours the audience was treated to
cakewalking in all its varieties, many
of them being revelations to the aver
age spectator. The professionals were
followed by those entered in the vari
ous other classes, all gayly costumed
and anxious to outdo each other. The
judges will render their decisions at
the close of, the carnival.
At 11 o'clock the floor was cleared
and an hour devoted to dancing, which
is to mark the close of the entertain
ment each night. It was announced
last night that a liberal proportion of
the gross receipts of the carnival was
to be donated to the fund for the re
ception of the California volunteers on
their return from the Philippines, and
to insure the proper expenditure of this
sum the following committee of well
known citizens has been appointed at
the instance of Managers Leon hard
and Buckley to take charge of the
money: Charles D. Pat ton, chairman;
J. A. Filcher, secretary and treasurer;
Colonel Ernest Denicke, Tirey L. Ford,
General Warfield and General Barrett.

GAS MEN WRANGLE
OVER ASSESSMENTS
Fighting for Relief Against Tax=
ation of Franchises.
Assessor Dodge, J. B. Crockett and Attorney Pillsbury
Bandy Facts and Figures at the Meeting of
the Board of Equalization.
<j7 B. CROCKETT, head and front of
the gas combine; C. O. G. Miller
the gas combine; C. O. G. Miller
V^^J) 0 and Attorneys E. S. Pillsbury and
Thomas B. Bishop and a half
dozen other representatives of more dol
lars than I could be stuffed into the gas
company's great, safe, went before the
Board of Equalization yesterday morning
to protest against the values that Asses
sor Dodge has placed upon their mo
nopoly.
The combined gas companies were there
to ask in. few words for a reduction of a
cool three millions and a half in their as
sessments and they had the best legal
talent In the city with them to make any
argument that might be needed. The
financial woes of the Pacific Gas Improve
ment Company were heard first and they
were ably set forth by Mr. Miller. Mr.
Miller stated that the franchise under
which his company is permitted to do
business was this year assessed at $2,445,
--450, a figure which he considered pre
posterous and for which he could find no
excuse." He requested a reduction of an
even million.
"The Pacific Gas Improvement Com
pany has no exclusive franchise." de
clared Mr. Miller. "1 do not see why As
sessor Dodge sees fit to tax it at all.
There are franchises now in operation in
this city which he has not touched at all
âthat of the Equitable Gas Company, for
instance. Why should not its franchise
be taxed as well as ours?" 7 7 -7 - v
"That's just the beauty of this system
of franchise taxation," said Assessor
Dodge. "On the -Ith of March the. Equit
able Company had only sixty meters set
and was not making money. Consequently
it was not taxed."
Mr. Pillsbury took up tne argument at
this point and it progressed with interest
for some minutes. ' "Why do you tax us
at all?" he demanded. "Our franchise is
not exclusive. Any one may get a fran
chise and lay gas pipe and charge the
same prices we do."
Mr. Dodge here referred to the taxation
of franchises in the State of New York.
"Yes," replied Mr. Pillsbury, "fran
chises are taxable in the State of New
York, and properly so, for the laws of
New York make franchises perpetual and
exclusive, and they, of a consequence,
have a certain tangible value, but the
laws of California are vastly . different.
Here any one may get a franchise. It is
not even necessary to incorporate. Any
one may dig up streets and lay pipe and
make gas and sell it for the same price
that we do. Nor are franchises perpetual
under the laws of this State. They ale
limited to a term of years and are not
exclusive and have no tangible, fixed
value upon which to base an assessment
for taxation. Another thing about the Cal
ifornia franchise: We could sell ours to
day to a company and you as Assessor
could not assess or tax it."
Mr. Miller relieved Mr. Pillsbury for a
few moments with the. statement that by
the reduction of the gas rate to $150 in
terest on the money invested had dropped
from 6 to 5 per cent, and that if the as
sessment were nearly doubled this year
even that figure might be reduced. Mr.
Miller attempted to show that Dodge had
discriminated against his company, and
by way of comparison referred to the
newspapers, which he said were under
assessed. He also declared that Mayor
Phelan had escaped taxation altogether.
Dodge replied that the assessment of
each of the newspapers had been raised
over last year's figures and that Mr. Phe
lan was assessed on all his taxable hold
ings. â¢ :.:,".;:>' â ^'â r.'M
Mr. Miller then gave way to President
Crockett, who opened the case for the
other branch of the combination. Mr.
Crockett was accompanied by his attor
ney. Thomas B. Bishop, and was pre
pared to show why the assessment of
$6,170,612 should he cut down to $4,652.000,
including $2,000,000 which he was willing
to allow for his franchise. â¢ Mr. Crocket!
met with but one difficulty in his exposi
tion. p It was in making his present alle
gations of falling interest and deprecia
tion of values jibe with the claims he set
up when a few months ago the gas rates
were being established. He objected
strongly to the valuation put upon the
land covered by the company's immense
plant and the numerous stations. North
Beach block No. 257. assessed by Dodge
at $105,000, he wanted reduced to $40,000.
and he made the same demand for several
other blocks in the same district. The
company's gas mains and pipe lines,
which were declared to be worth $3,000,000
when the gas rate was being fixed, were
assessed at half that amount, but he de
sired a reduction to $250,000. Gas meters
valued by the Assessor at $115,000 he want
ed cut to $57,500. Dynamos and electrical
apparatus listed at $130,000 he said were
worth only $45,000, and he brought J. E.
Green, his engineer, to prove it. Under
ground construction and conduits billed
at $360,000 he declared were worthy of an
assessment of only $160,000.
The rest of Mr. Crockett's Ideas of value
had warped to about the same degree,
since March last and it was an 'evident
relief When he finished and asked only

There were several other things he
â¢wanted to know, but a motion by Super
visor Byington that the Assessor's fig
ures be allowed to. stand stopped the
questions. Byington was seconded by
Perrault. but Aigeltinger moved to amend
by holding the whole matter over until
to-morrow morning. He was at once
seconded by Collins, and Supervisor Hey
er, who was In the chair, was about to
put the amendment when Perrault inter
rupted with a substitute which provided
that each Of the items in the company's
protests be cut down $100. Lackmann
seconded and Heyer put the substitute.
It was defeated by a vote of six to five â
Byington. Deasy. Heyer, I>ackmann and
Perrault voting aye; Aigcltine.er, At
tridge, Collins, Holland, Kalben and
Phelps voting no. Supervisor Black was

"Well, you fellows have refused to re
duce and" the Assessor's figures stand."
declared Perrault. "The whole thing is
settled." And then a roar went up. Col
lins jumped to his feet to vehemently
deny that such was the case, and the re
maining six of the seven backed his po
sition. Chairman Heyer was called on
for a ruling and he decided that the de
feat of Perrault's substitute to the
amendment finally settled the whole
proposition.
"Don't be a fool." yelled Collins, and
then Bvington moved to take a recess
until 2:15 o'clock. This was defeated by
the same vote of 6 to 5. Aigeltinger or
dered Clerk Russell to call the roll upon
the amendment, but this Russell declined
to do unless so ordered by the chair, .and
the chair refused. Collins then put the.
amendment to a vote himself and it was
carried by the same vote. Heyer declared
the vote out of order and Aigeltinger
moved that the chair be declared vacant
and Phelps be made chairman; but even
the combine would not consent to that,
and so the episode ended. The whole
matter will be called up again on Monday.
In the afternoon Attorney Riordan ap
peared on behalf of a score of Chinese
merchants who were attempting to unload
a good portion of their assessments. As
sessor Dodge soon found himself in the
middle of another heated argument. He.
was obliged to detail the system his men
pursued in appraising Chinese holdings
and the . difficulties that were thrown in
their way. Riordan announced that he,
did not expect to get the reductions he
asked for. but said that ho was preparing
; a suit against Assessor Dodge and the city
i and would fight his case in that way. Mr.
; Riordan also appeared on behalf of S. B.
I Peterson, Charles Nelson and XV. _.
i Megill. who are owners of deep-sea ships
i which have been assessed by Mr. Dodge.
; The ships, he said, ply between the Puget
! Sound country and Australia and do no
j business in the waters of the State, nei-
I ther are they registered here. He claimed
I that they were only assessable at the
i place of their registration, and the board
i was inclined to uphold this view.
With other matters this was faken un
der advisement until to-morrow, when the
board will meet at 10 o'clock.

POLITICAL WARS
KEEP CHILDREN
FROM WASHING
Henry Weber Meets
New Obstructions.
â â¦ â
HIS PRAYER UNANSWERED
â â¢ â
â ANNEXED DISTRICT TO WAIT A
LITTLE LONGER.
â¦ ,
Scores of Families Are Without Any
Sewerage Facilities, While Poli
ticians Wrangle Over Dis
tribution of Spoils.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 15.
An anxious father and twelve beautiful
children are watching with great anxiety
the progressâ or rather the lack of
progressâ of a little political scheme aimed
at City Engineer Clement.
The proud parent Is Henry Weber of
Temescal. and. with his twelve children,
wife and servant he is forced to live in a
house without a sewer. The troubles of
Mr. Weber were very clearly told some
weeks ago in a manuscript lecture he read
to the City Count 11. He was promised
the speediest relief possible, but now 0 --"
tics has intervened and the fourteen Web
ers may not be able to wash their faces
more than once a week.
"Do not send me back to my family,"
â¢â¢aid Mr. Weber, "to tell them that they
cannot wash themselves to-morrow. My
cesspools are all full. If 1 run my
drainage on the street the Board
of Health threatens to arrest me, and
you will not give me permission to lay a
sewer. I am proud of my twelve children.
] wash them every day, and, oh, gentle
men, do not force us to be dirty."
The relief the Council promised was the
passage of an ordinance appropriating
$4000 for the purpose of having an engineer
prepare a scientific system for the whole
of the annexed district. Mr. Weber was
promised that this should be done. at once
and that as soon as the plans were ac
cepted the sewers Would be ordered down
immediately.
Since thenâ two weeks agoâ th.c*
phadow of politics has spread itself over
the annexed district sewer question.
Under ordinary circumstances the WOO for
this special work would go to the City
Engineer, who is paid in fees for the
work that he does. There are big politi
cal differences, however, between the City
Engineer and the officials who have the
votes in the Council and Board of Works.
It is therefore being so arranged that a
special engineer sha'i be employed to pre
pare the sewer plans so that Mr. Clement
will not reap the benefit or" his recent elec
tion to the uttermost.
And while all this is going on Mr.
Mr. Weber, Mrs. Weber, the twelve little-
Webers and the Weber servant are pray-

STANTON MAY REGAIN
HIS POWER OF SPEECH
OAKLAND. July 15.â The condition of
J. Stanton, the patient at the Receiving
Hospital whose skull was fractured in
some unknown manner, continues to im
prove. Dr. Porter removed the bandages
from Stanton's head this afternoon. He.
was well pleased with the appearance of
the wound/which showed that the opera
tion of removing the shattered bone and
a portion of the brain matter proved in
every way successful. A. Constance, a
cook from San Francisco, who identified
Stanton yesterday, visited his friend this
afternoon. Stanton recognized him and
showed encouraging indications of return
ing power of speech. : He Is still unable to
express himself Intelligently, but Dr. Por
ter believes now that his patient will re
cover and be able in a few days to clear
up the mystery of the manner in which he
sustained his almost fatal blow.
I GREEN APPLES KILLED HIM.
OAKLAND, July lo.â Lamar Peregoy,
aged 10 years, died in convulsions at the
home of his aged mother, "1027 Chester
street, last evening- after remaining un
conscious for nearly twenty hours. Ac
cording to Dr. A. li. Pratt, who had at
tended the hoy, death is attributable to
eating too many green apples.
There was an air of mystery surround
ing :he case when first reported, for it
was given out that Mrs. Peregoy had
found her son unconscious in his room
last Thursday morning with the gas
turned on full force. She therefore con
cluded that he had been asphyxiated. Mrs.
Peregoy now states that on last Wednes
day her son ate gui! a number of green
apples. - She says, too, that she- did not
know the cause of death until the doctor
told her :
Dr. Pratt says that when he called to
attend the boy there were no symptoms
of gas poisoning. Drs. Sanborn and
Wilkii . who were called later, are equally
convinced that gas poisoning was not the
cause of death
STRUCK BY A LOCOMOTIVE.
OAKLAND. July George A. Car
â  penter, a conductor for the past several
years on the Seventh-street local, was
1 struck by a locomotive at the Oakland
I mole to-day and sustained a broken arm
j and internal injuries which may prove
fatal.
Carpenter was hurrying to the office at
the mole, and while crossing the track
was struck squarely by the engine' of the
Berkeley local, then switching. The loco
; motive "was running at low speed, but
threw Carpenter to one side. He was
picked up unconscious and taken to his
home. 766 East Seventeenth -street, in the
. ambulance of the Fabiola Hospital. Dr.
B. A. Bain- was summoned and found that
besides a broken left arm there were in-

Who undermined Councilman Cuvelller?
Prince Poniatowski changes in tempera

! ited him three months ago he received

the special committee, which will be pre

the Prince received the delegates luke
warmly on a subsequent occasion, and,
according to the report of the Mayor,
which forms a part of the committee's re

, ambition to own its own water supply as
I a dead cold frost.
It Is very significant that while the Blue
Lakes Company refuses to extend any
aid to Oakland In this matter the water
monopoly of this city has just promised
, Its first dividend in five years. The Contra
Costa Water Company is a San Francisco
j corporation, although every cent's worth
of its business is done on this side of the
bay. It Is more than suspected that the
Prince and some of the capitalists who
own the Contra Costa Company met In
San Francisco and agreed among them
selves to force Oakland to bow to Its
monopoly and to snub It for daring to

i presume that It could get a supply of
water on Its own account.
Three months ago Councilman Cuvellier
commenced work on this subject. He was
led to believe by Prince Ponlatowskt and
i his associates that for about five million
dollars an adequate supply of water could**
be brought to the city limits of Oakland.
' Mayor Snow said that it could not be done
: for less than seventeen millions, and now
i the Mayor is almost in the position of
! being able to say, "I told you so." because
the report shows that It could not be un
: dertaken for less than fifteen millions. .
"After the first" meeting with the Prince
no one could be found willing to tell what
had transpired in- conversation with his.
i Highness. But the report shows very plainly
! that somebody had determined to upset
; Mr. Ouve'.lier's worthy plans of. relieving
j Oakland's taxpayers and got in his deadly
work with the Blue Lakes people. Mr.

NEW YORK. July 15.â A Sun cable from

a claim for a $350,000 estate left by a
miner who perished in the Klondike
about two months ago and, according
to information received to-day from
Washington, she stands a good chance
of securing the fortune.
The dead man is supposed to have

left Chicago two years ago for the
gold country and has never been heard
of since until Mrs. Sutton read of his
death in the papers. _ '
Mrs. Sutton communicated with the
State Department, forwarding a min

COURT NOTES.
Charles Eberhardt. Ellsworth street,
was yesterday sent to the County Jail for
thirty days by Judge Mogan on the
charge of cruelty to his children. . He had
' taken his wife's gold watch and $10 and
the Judge threatened to give him thirty
days more unless ho returned them to
her. She-was in court and. saved him
from getting the additional sentence. It
took four officers to arrest him.
When the case of Lee Wee Doo. charged
with assault with a deadly weapon upon
Hung Dung Chow, COO Jackson street, was
called in Judge Mogan's court yesterday,
the Judge at once saw that it had been
"squared.'.' He insisted noon the ease
going on. and Ah Sing, the principal wit
ness, who had declared thai he saw the
defendant hit Hung Dung Chow over the
head with an iron bar, could not recol
lect anything about It. The Judge or
dered him Into custody and will probably
have him charged with perjury. The
case was continued until to-morrow.
A warrant was sworn out yesterday In
Judge Mogan's court for the arrest of
Fred Uphoff, 06 Sharon street, on the
charge of cruelty to his two minor chil
dren. He has failed to contribute to their
support for some time and his wife says
he intends to desert her. He got six
months about a year ago for battery
upon his wife*.

FRUIT AND SALMON IN ENGLAND.
"Californlan fruits continue in strong de
mand, both for goods on the spot and for for
ward delivery. The position regarding the new
pack is unchanged, and at the present moment
there is decidedly an excess of buyers over
sellers," says the London Grocers' Gazette In
consequence of the 'combines' on the Ameri
can Bide there is great uncertainty as to the
future, and packers will not quote prices at
the present time. This has caused spot stocks,
which are very considerably reduced, to ad
vance. There Is likely to be completely ex
hausted markets before the arrival of new.
The demand for salmon from first hands con
tinues disappointing, but nominally prices are
without change."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 15.â T0-day's short market
was so narrow and so nearly stagnant that
movements of prices were of little significance.
There was a perceptible tone of firmness, how
ever, which was emphasized after the appear
ances of the bank statement by the hasty cov
ering of some small bear contracts in the
grangers which had been put out Just previous
to the appearance of the statement. Probably
the greater part of the day's business was
given over to the closing out of short contracts
by the bears. This contingent has been partic
ularly active In Brooklyn Transit during the
past week on the persistent talk of a pending
strike. Their buying to cover to-day made that
stock the most active on the list and moved it
up two points from the opening decline. Sugar
was largely bought and rose at one time 1%
over last night. People's Gas recovered sharp
ly from yesterday's prices. Oregon Navigation
preferred advanced 1% on the discharge of the
voting trust and the Implied guarantee of pre
ferred dividends to the amount of 10 per cent
ln yearly installments. Cotton oil rose over a
point. Manhattan and the Southwestern rail
roads were also Inclined to strength. The bank
statement was up to expectations ln the item
of loan contractions, and the consequent reduc
tion ln deposit liabilities. It was unexpectedly
favorable in the showing of a gain in cash
considering the payment of $2,500,000 to the Sub-
Treasury on customs payments during the week.
The local money market worked still lower to
day, but demand sterling advanced a small
fraction and London discounts were also hard
er. Sterling exchange at Continental centers
also rose sharply tending to the note of alarm
sounded by the weekly English financial publi
cations over the Immediate future of the Lon
don money market.
The week in Wall street has offered evidences
that an eager speculative contingent Is watch
ing for an opportunity to embark on the long
side of the market. There is evidence also
that a large portion of the contingent was not
possessed of abundant funds, and the continued
tightness of the money market and the success
ful machinations of the bears have checked the
bullish enthusiasm, wiped out margins and
precipitated considerable speculative liquida
tion. A number of individual stocks, however,
have shown aggressive strength on large buy
ing and have sustained the general list. The
activity of the market for call loans on the
Stock Exchange, even at the high rates, also
Indicates confidence in some quarters ln the
earjv clearing of the situation. The extended
period of the hardness of money after the July
1 period upset the calculations of many ob
servers, and last Saturday's bank statement,
showing surplus reserves down to near $5,000,
--000 and lower than since the panic of 1893,
caused something like alarm. There were large
orders to sell at the opening on Monday, as it
was certain that many loans would be called
to reduce deposit accounts of the banks that
were below their legal reserve limit. The acute
phases of the Transvaal situation interfered
with values abroad and emphasized the money
stringency in all foreign centers, with the re
sult that London offered large amounts of
stock for sale in New York. Finally there was
acute weakness in New York traction stocks
on fears of a strike and In People's Gas on re
ported plans for an opposition plant. The com
bined effort was a violent break ln prices
through most of the list and an active selling
movement. The almost complete recovery on
the following day, on only two-thirds the vol
ume of Monday's business, demonstrated the
precipitate selling had been well absorbed and
the amount of stock for sale greatly dimin
ished. - ,
The technical position of the market was
thus much strengthened by the shaking out of
weak bolder* It came to be better under
stood that Saturday's bank statement, being
based on average? of the totals for each day
ln the preceding week, did not fairly reflect the
actual condition of the banks on the date when
It was made. At the same time It became
known that some very large loans made on ac
count of the organization' of the tube industry
and to the New York City government pend
ing its sale of new bonds had been liquidated,
and that funds disbursed on July 1 for dlvD
dends and interest were coming back Into de
posit accounts of New York banks. But the
relief afforded on this account gave way to re
newed uneasiness when It was perceived that
the rate for demand sterling was hardening as
the local rate for money became easier. It
was feared that the continued urgent needs of
the London mone- market would cause a fur
ther drain of gold . from New York and keep
the local rate high for a considerable- time to
come. The downward tendency of long sterl
ing under offerings of futures against merchan
dise shipments partly answered the fears on
this snore. . .
The bond market was moderately active and
rather Irregular, Southwestern Railway Issues
moving up in sympathy with the strength of
the stocks.

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK, July 15.â Financier says:
j There was a material Improvement in the con
' dition of the associated banks of New York
! last week, the reserve above legal requirements
I showing a gain of $5,636,275, which brings the
I total surplus cash to $10,695.750. This was the
' result of a rather drastic liquidation in loans,
! that Item having decreased no less than $17,- ,
j 150,700.
A coincident contraction of $15,273,100 in de- â¢
I posits reduced reserved requirements by $3,
--815,000, and this, added to the gain of $1,818,000
in specie, made the expansion in surplus as
I stated. The statement is much more favorable
I than preliminary estimates had forecast. The
: known movements of money indicated that the
1 banks had lost more money than they had
1 gained, the treasury absorptions being respon
-1 sible for this opinion. But it Is possible that
the previous statements as set forth last week
' in this review very much underrated the real
i position of the Clearing-house institutions. In
the same manner the gains from the Interior
(or the current week were probably larger than
i expected. In any event the reserve has been
j materially strengthened, also it Is still much
: below the average. Whether the statements for
i the next week or two will continue to show
i cash gains cannot be asserted positively, but
I lt is known that a portion of the July divi
; dend disbursements, especially those by the
Government, have not yet been redeposited ln .
banks. The treasury, owing to customs col
| lections, has been a gainer -* late from the
banks. The principal point of interest centers
i In the crop movement demands, the season for j
! which Is rapidly approaching. If reports from j
1 the interior are correct, and the bank ex
-1 hibits now being published seem to show that
I they are. It Is difficult to see where New York
can lose much money in that direction during 1
I the early fall. Reserves all over the country I
; are extremely high and a drain on New York j
i heavy enough to advance Interest rates would
I Inevitably attract large sums of money to this |
I center. The question of foreign exchange is !
j again a subject. of Interest, but In the present
state of the market it will require a. profitable
premium Indeed t6 induce an outward flow of |
j gold. Considered from ever*- standpoint, the
I next few weeks give promise of developing
; some important phases in the monetary world.
THE LONDON MARKET.
'â¢ NEW YORK, July 15.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were lifeless and nervous
' to-day on the Transvaal war preparations,
; which are proceeding actively. The situation
Is apparently delicate. A bank rate of 6 per
cent is talked of in the event of hostilities and
the expectation now is that the rate will he

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 15.â Wheat opened with a
show of firmness, %*"?*_. c over yesterday, at
73% c for September. The upward impulse was
due to reports of too much rain In- the West
and Northwest for the prosecution or harvest
ing. This prop failed early and after selling at
73%073%c September started on a decline from
which there was no rally Cables were indif
ferent, receipts heavy and many bears were re
cruited from* yesterday* bull ranks, -he
weather was principally In -the winter wheat
belt but receipts were heavy enough to check
buying. The cash demand was light. The
Northwest sold wheat In the local market, fine
weather talk and a prospective large Increase
in the visible helped the short sellers. Septem
ber declined steadily to 72% c and closed at 72%
@72% c.
There was considerable selling of September
corn, which opened a shade over yesterday's
close. Weakness followed In sympathy with
wheat. ' September closed a fraction lower.
Oats were firm and %c higher at the opening,
but declined with the break in corn and wheat,
closing a shade under yesterday.
The heavy run of hogs caused a decline In
provisions. September pork dropped off 12 %c,

PORTLAND, July 15.â Spring grown grain :
and re-seeded fields of wheat on light lands in j
a number of localities In the Northwest may be .
termed In a critical condition as a result of the
hot weather of the past week. The intensely i
hot weather has caught the grain at a stage
where it was at the worst disadvantage. At
nearly all points south of Snake River fall 1
grain and spring grain, planted early on heavy 1
soil, is not injured .by the heat. - but' grain
less fortunately situated has been burning. Re- j
ports are ln a measure conflicting, but reports
received in this city within the past forty-eight :
hours show that the crop in many localities
has been considerably damaged.

KILLS HIMSELF
IN FRONT OF
THE HOSPITAL
Joseph Feeney Es
capes to End Life.
Â» â 4 â
PHYSICAL MISERY THE CAUSE
â * â
HE WAS AN INMATE OF THE
COUNTY HOSPITAL.
c
Scaled the Walls and Deliocrately
Shot Himself Outside the
Gates â Left to Secure
the Pistol.
Joseph Feeney, a shoemaker, bent by
! age and sickness, cut off his life yesterday
j morning on the corner of Twenty-second
and Potrero streets, a 32-caliber revolver
serving as the death-dealing instrument.
For two days previous to his suicide ho j
was an inmate of the City and County ]
Hospital, where he was being treated for j
I gastric ailments and a spinal affection. j
He left the hospital grounds yesterday
j morning without a permit, and a few !
hours later shot himself In the lower part j
lof the right side. The ball passed through !
i his body and lodged in the opposite side)
of his chest.
On Thursday night Feeney applied at j
i the hospital for medical treatment. Ills ;
] case was not of a serious nature, so he I
was allowed his liberty and the free use ,
'of the grounds. He remained under the |
i cure Of the hospital physicians until yes- I
terday morning, when his absence was
; noted. Just before the noon hour a shot ;
I was heard and the guards on watch at I
i the main gate rushed out to find that a |
; man had shot himself about 200 feet west
! of the main entrance.
The man was then carried into the hos- :
I pital. Dr. Ebrlght operated upon him and :
removed the bullet, but Feeney died soon j
I after. , ,_. . .
How he secured the pistol with which he
I ended his life is a mystery. It is the be- 1
I lief of the hospital physicians and at
tendants that lie effected an escape by
scaling the walls. When he entered the
hospital he did not have a pistol. He:
might have secreted it somewhere in the
j neighborhood within easy reach upon his ,
discharge. . - . . â-
Feeney was a na.tlve of Ireland. 6. years ;
lof age. He spent the last thirty-five years
'of his life in California. When entering I
I the City and County Hospital he said he <
was married and had two grown sons liv- t
I Ing at 336 Howard street.

The Planter and Emma Claudina
Make Good Runs No More
Midday Trips to Alcatraz
and Angel Island.
The overdue sugar fleet began to arrive
from the Islands Friday night, and kept
on arriving all of yesterday. The bark
entine Planter made the best run and the
bark Mohican the worst. All of the ves
sels met with light winds and calms, but
the Planter struck a lead which Captain
McNeill took advantage of and reached
port in twenty-one days. The next best
run was that of the barkentine Robert
Sudden, twenty-two days from Honolulu,
and then came the brig W. G. Irwin,
twenty-three days from Honolulu; brig
Consuelo, twenty-five days from Mahu
kona; schooner Aloha, twenty-five days;
ship Standard, thirty-one days, and bark
Mohican, thirty-four days from Honolulu.
This Is the Standard's first visit to this
port. She was at Honolulu to load sugar
for New York when San Francisco par
ties bought her, and in future she will
run between here and the islands. The
Standard was built in 1878 at Bath, Me.,
and is 1461 tons net burden. She is 212
feet long. 40 feet 2 inches broad and 24
feet 5 inches deep. Captain Getchell will
leave the Standard here and Captain
Backus, late of the barkentine Edward
May, will take command of her. -
There was a fatality on the barkentine
Robert Sudden during the run from Hon
olulu. It happened on July 10, in latitude
38 north, longitude 137.56 west. Captain
Blrkholm was crowding on every stitch
of canvas to "woo the freshening breeze,"
and the barkentine was slipping through
the water at the rate of ten knots an
hour, when the cry of "A man over
board!" was raised. William Stanton,
one of the sailors, fell overboard from the
port mizzen rigging, and although the
ship was hove to and a boat lowered the
poor fellow sank before assistance could
reach him.
Strange to say, there was also a fatal
ity on the British ship Earl of Dunmore,
which arrived from Newcastle, N. S. XV.,
yesterday, on the same date and almost
in the same latitude and longitude. Will
iam Phillips, an "A. 8.," aged 24 years,
died from some wasting disease and was
buried at sea. He had been ill during
the whole voyage and was almost a skel
eton when he passed away. According to
an old custom, his effects were auctioned
off the next day, and the proceeds, along
with his pay, will be sent to the dead
man's relatives in England,
Captain Kay says the Earl of Dunmore
had to beat her way to San Francisco.
She was eighty-seven days getting here
and had head winds nearly ail the way.
In latitude 39.34 south, longitude 162. 34
west, she ran into some heavy weather,
during which she suffered damage, and
again on June 2 there were some heavy
squalls, which played havoc with the can
vas
The sugar fleet are not the only vessels
that are making long passages. The
British ship Ancaios Is now out 109 days
from Liverpool with, a general cargo and
should be heard from soon. On ADril 3
sbv wa.! in latitude 40 south, longitude 58
west, and must have had a hard time of
it rounding the Horn. The new four
masted schooner Ja*n*es H. Bruce and the
British ship Bidston Hill are both out
eighty-four days for Nlcolaefski and Ma
nila respectively. The Bruce left here
with a general cargo for the Siberian
coast and was expected to make a quick
run. The Bidston Hill took Government
stores for Manila and sailed from here
sixteen days after the American ship
Marion Cbncott left Seattle on a similar
errand. The latter vessel reached Manila
on June 10, but the Bidston Hill has not
jet put in an appearance. There Is a
chance that both the James H. Bruce and
Bidston Hill have arrived and the fact
has not been telegraphed. â '/ -.
The transports Newport and Ohio are
being overhauled and will be ready for
another voyage to Manila In twelve days.
The Tartar will sail on the 22d with two
battalions of the Nineteenth Infantry and
100 recruits. One of the officers of the
Oregon Regiment is minus^his gold watch
and chain and a bundle of sliver mounted
canes. In the hurrry and bustle of get
ting away from the transport Newport on
Friday he forgot the things, and when he
went back for them yesterday they were
gone. -*".'"
Visitors to Alcatraz and Angel Islands
will not be able to make a midday trip
ln future. Owing to the quantity of freight
that has to be carried to the detention
camp at Angel Island the service steamer
has more than she can do. In consequence
the midday trip will be discontinued until
further orders.
Captain Buckman, formerly master of
the whaleback steamer City of Everett,
but for the last two years port captain
for the Pacific Mall Company at Panama,
Is coming home for a well earned holiday.
He has not been well for some time past
and needs a rest. Captain Tllton, formerly
chief officer of the transport Newport,
leaves for Panama on the San Juan next
Tuesday to relieve him.
Josie Anderson, who lives on August
street, off Union, made another attempt
at suicide yesterday. She has been treats
three times as a would-be suicide at the
Harbor Hospital, but her Injuries, have
always been slight. Yesterday she swal
lowed some carbolic acid, so she says,
but if she did Dr. Morrison could not find
any trace of the drug. She was put to

any developments. Josie is a divorced

EXCITING HORSERACE

Shasta's Sheriff Beats Robber Gen
try's Stepfather From Red
ding" to Keswick.
REDDING, July 15.â Sheriff C. H. Boh
hens had a very exciting chase from
Redding to Keswick to-day. Ernest Gen
try, who is under arrest awaiting the ar
rival of the Sheriff from Socorro, N. M.,
where he is wanted for having stolen
$6000 in Government script, -was taken
before Justice of the Peace Herzlnger for
the correction of an error In the papers
on which he is held. Sheriff Behrens has
been watching the express office and
mall closely for the missing script. Yes
terday* a package labeled "life Insurance
policy*' arrived at the Wells-Cargo office
at Keswick for Gentry. Sheriff Behrens
was getting ready to go after It to-day
when Gentry was taken to the court
room. Gentry's stepfather, Jacob Ran
dall of Keswick, was present.
When he was not watched Gentry wrote
an order for the package and gave It to
Randall. Randall ran out, jumped upon
his horse and started for Keswick on the
run. Sheriff Behrens hastily procured a
saddle horse and went in hot pursuilt to
beat Randall to the Keswick express of
fice. Both men are experienced horse
men and they fairly flew over the moun
: tain trails. Randall had fifteen minutes
start, but Behrens overtook him when
100 yards from the office, after having
covered the eight miles over the moun
tains in thirty-five minutes.
Both men sprang from their horses
and rushed into the office. At the Sher
iff's order the package was delivered to
him. It was found to contain nothing but
a life insurance policy in favor of Gen
try's mother, just as it was labeled. The
officers are confident that Gentry ana
Randall believed the package contained
the missing Government script, and the
express and mall will be very closely
watched. The Insurance policy probably
was sent to see if the package would get
through safely.
JUST A CHICAGO BLUFF.

Reported Offer to Sharkey and Jef
fries Occasions Mirth. â¢
NEW YORK, July 15.â An evening paper
says the report that a Chicago syndicate
is making arrangements for a meeting be
tween Jeffries and Sharkey, -ml is pre
pared to offer a purse of 175.000, is char
acterized by fight promoters here as Chi
cago wind." When the stand taken by
Mayor Harrison against the previously
proposed appearances of any of the flrst
class heavv-welghts is recalled, it may
easily be seen that Jeffries and Sharkey
are effectually barred. When Jeffries was
last in Chicago a proposition for him to
meet third-class heavy-weights in limited
round bouts was vetoed, and that ho was
permitted to appear in a short exhibition
bout with his brother was looked upon as
a concession. The only possible shadow of
truth in the offer is that Chicago pro
moters are reported to be negotiating for
the formation of an athletic club in Du
buque, lowa, at which it is proposed to
hold contests of twenty rounds during the
coming winter.

COUNTY CLERK
SWINGS THE AX
UNWILLINGLY
Is Forced to Reduce
Regular Staff.
â â¦ â
TWENTY-FIVE HEADS FALL
â â
ALL TRUST TO LUCK IN A GAME
OF DRAW.
Â«
If the Supervisors Grant Additional
Moneys to the Office All Men
Dismissed Will Be Re
' appointed.
Â«
In obedience to the will of the Super
visor?; and ln anticipation of an adverse
ruling by the Supreme Court on the peti
tion for a rehearing of the issues Involved
in the case recently decided limiting the
number of under-offlclals in the County
Clerk's office, action has been taken and
the heads o_ twenty-five have fallen into
the basket. Yesterday afternoon it was
announced by County Clerk Deane that
the force of the office must be reduced
to me.i the present conditions. He also
announced thai in order, to be fair to ail
concerned that the names of all copyists
and deputies would be placed in a oallot
Vox. with the exception of those of Joseph
Uoddard, acting chief deputy, and John :
Flood, copyist and private secretary, j
sufficient would be drawn to allow the j
office to run within the appropriation -
made by the Supervisors, and those un
fortunates whose names remained within
must step down and out.
The remaining hours of the day were,
in consequence, hours of suspense for the
host of under-officials. Five o'clock came
and the entire office force adjourned to
the court room of Department Six. Jo
seph Goddard carried the box containing
the names, and when ail were seated Mr.
Deane began his remarks.
"Gentlemen, you all know why we are
here." he said. "This seems to be the un
fortunate year for the office of the County
Clerk. We have been made to suffer for
the good of all other offices in the city
â¢ nd county government, it seems. You are
all, of course, familiar with the decision
of the Supreme Court, which, by the way,
is in abeyance owing to the fact that a
-petition for a rehearing is at present be
fore the court, but you all must know that
the Supervisors have taken action against
our office without giving us an opportu
nity to finally determine just what laws
govern our affairs. 1 have been before
the Supervisors and have quoted law and
facts. 1 have shown them that in past
administrations the sum of $110,000 a year
has been granted with which to run the
County Clerk's office, but still they have
cut us down to $71,700. Of this amount
$;.ti.OOO is for the first six months, giving
just J'*'"" l a month with which to conduct
the office. Of this amount $500 must be
expended for stationery, and hence but
j:,",' i can be expended for salaries. The 1
remaining six months must be conducted
at an expense somewhat under $6000 a
month, and. as you all know, the efficien
cy of the office cannot be kept up on that j
basis.
â¢â¢This afternoon the board met as a
board of equalization, and they could have j
easily taken up a communication which I
sent "them and granted me the proper ap
propriation for the office. All I asked was j
-90,000, and from this I agreed to pay all
salaries, purchase stationery and conduct ;
the entire business of the office. As they j
would not grant my request it is there- j
fore necessary that the force of the office I
be reduced to suit the condition, but I
promise that in event the board at a sub
sequent date allows the proper appropria
tion I will again appoint each and every
man that the present unfortunate circum
stance deprives of position.
"An even more startling condition at
present faces us when we consider the
decision of the Supremo Court. Under j
this decision the force of the office is re
duced to thirty-two men. At the present
time, as you all know, there are twelve
courts, and under the decision I can em- j
ploy but nine courtroom clerks. There ;
are at present thirty-six copyists to do
the work of the two departments of the
Probate Court, and the decision only al- |
lows four. If this decision prevails the !
efficiency of the office will be paralyzed. |
Serious trouble will result. The Probate !
courts will be at a standstill, criminals,
who have a right to be tried within a cer- :
tain period, will have to be freed and the
public will suffer to an unlimited degree.
The Supreme Court has seen fit to rele- j
gate the affairs of the office to a decision
of twenty-seven years ago, when the city I
was practically a village. Still, w_
must abide by the law, and we will do our i
best to conduct the office on the limited
appropriation; but I am afraid that our I
best will accomplish but little toward the '
desired result. .- '
"To-day the three courtroom clerks who '
must step down and out under the deci
sion of the Supreme Court will not be re- i
moved from their positions. Before we
determine by ballot who must go we will j
await the remittitur from the Supreme '
Court, which will arrive on the -Ist inst.
If. however, in the meantime the Supreme
Court will grant a rehearing these men
may not of necessity be removed, and,
again, the Supervisors may be induced :
to grant a further appropriation which i
will enable the immediate reappointment j
of you who must step out after the names
have been withdrawn from the box."
At this point Mr. Goddard. whose effi- I
ciency as chief deputy resulted in County j
Clerk Deane refusing to risk him to the
chance of the box, started to take the
names from the box, calling them off as
each was drawn. It was an anxious
crowd that watched the proceedings, but
when it was over all. even those to whom
fortune had been unkind, breathed easier.
The suspense was at an end and all knew
just where they stood.
The names of the copyists who will re- !
main in the office were first drawn from I
the box by Mr. Goddard. They are: ]
George Chenowyth, Frank Williams. 1.

Am soon as the labor of reducing th->
staff of the office by the chance system
instituted by Mr. Deane had been con
cluded, he again announced that in the
event a further appropriation was granted
he would reappoint all whom adverse for
tune had removed. This settled, the
meeting broke up. and now comes the
wait for further developments.

ICEMAN CROWLEY
DECAMPS WITH
TILLIE HEROLD

I New Conquest Inherits Some Money

<
I J. George Crowley, a. familiar figure
i along "the line" and popularly known as
; "Iceman Crowley," has disappeared for
' parts unknown and with him lias gone
: Tillie Herold, a transient butterfly and _.
prominent member of the half-world.
Crowley, up to the time of his disap
. pearance about a week ago, was book
j keeper and confidential agent of the Union
: Ice Company, a fact to which he owes his
| sobriquet of "iceman." There were ru
] mors to the effect that his books were In
I bad shape and that he had defaulted to
I the tune of several hundred dollars, but
i inquiry at the offices of the company on
Fourth street failed to develop any con
firmation of the rumors. The officials of
the concern stated that Crowley had not
taken one cent of its money.
Crowley first became notorious about a
year ago when his wife, Mattle Crowley,
! obtained a divorce from him. It is said
J that Mrs. Crowley is a ravishingly beau
| tiful woman, but her husband had descri
ed her for another. She was awarded
$25 a month alimony and the custody of
the child. About a month 'ago CrotvJey
was in court again, having been sued by
Ms former wife for the payment of ali
mony. â '*--''.
Crowley instituted a' counter-suit in
I which he endeavored to gam possession of
! the child by claiming that the mother
was not a flt person to care for it. lie
i made some sensational charges, which
were thoroughly exploited in The Call, to
i the effect that she had tried to induce
I him to go East and work the "badger
i game" on wealthy Easterners, and also
to blackmail certain prominent men in :
this city. The charges were not sustained,
however, and Crowley lost his suit.
After his divorce Crowley became a con
stant habitue of the tenderloin and led a
gay life with Viola Smith, who had apart
ments at the Royal Eagle on Ellis street.
He rolled things high and spent more
money than was commensurate with his
income, which gave rise to the story of
his defalcation.
About a week ago he fell in with Tillie
Herold. who recently inherited a large
sum of money by the death of an aunt in
i the East, and the tenderloin became very
I warm from the burning of much. money
by Crowley and his new conquest. Tillie
: won the "iceman" away completely from
j Viola, and after a week's hilarious time
decamped with him and left the old love
i to struggle with her sorrow and loneli

HELLO GIRL WRITES
ABOUT HER TROUBLES
TELLS CORONER HILL ABOUT
LONG HOURS OF TOIL.
Testimony of the Superintendent at
the Inquest Contradicted in
Advance by One of His
Employes.
Some of the telephone girls do not trike
any stock in the roseate statement of
Superintendent Lehigh given at the in
quest into the death of Anita Byrne, who
poisoned herself last Tuesday with car
bolic acid.
Mr. Lehigh swore that the girls. were
required to work only eight hours per
day. but this statement is controverted
by the writer of an anonymous letter re
ceived through the mail yesterday morn
ing by Coroner Hill. The letter was signed
"A Telephone Girl."
The Coroner informed the reporters that
he had received af the same time another
note from the same girl giving her name
under the seal of confidence. The anony
mous letter is dated July 14, 1599, and
reads as follows:
Coroner Hillâ Dear Sir: I read in
this morning's Call about your In
tended investigation into the workings
of the Telephone Company. We are
worked to death. We are supposed to
work nine hours every day, but more
often it is lengthened to ten or twelve
hours. Every other Sunday we work
ten hours, with a rest of twenty min
utes to snatch a bit to eat. No holi
day from January 1 to December 31.
If a girl has a free Sunday she is often
called to work some part of the day or
night. When the office is very busy
the manager is supposed to call upon
the main office for assistance, but
Manager Adam of the east office, in
stead of doing that, works the girls
nearly to death and gives them 10 cents
an tour for their overtime. If they
! are worn out and refuse to work they
are threatened with dismissal.
I have heard many a girl say that
she would kill herself if she was not
going out of the office soon. Don't
expect truthful statements from em
ployes of the company. They would
be dismissed if they spoke .the truth.
The girls live in dread of Maggie Ken
nedy and tremble and turn pale If
the*.- think she Is listening on their
table. I cannot sign my name, because
I work for the company, but if you
will be instrumental in benefiting our
case we will all say, "God Bless Coro
ner Hill."
JURORS AGAIN FILE SUIT.
Ask That the Supervisors Be Com
pelled to Approve Their Demands.
Louis P. Boardman. as attorney for the
Jurors In the various criminal depart
ments of the Superior Court, filed a peti
tion yesterday for a writ of mandate to
compel the Board of Supervisors to audit
the demands of the Jurors on the Treas
urer. William Birch, one of the jurors,
appears as petitioner. In the petition it is
set forth that affiant is entitled by law
to be paid by the city and county for ser
vice as a juror the sum of $2 a day for
each day's attendance. As it is neces
sary that the demand of the juror first be
approved by the board, hence the writ to
compel that body to pass upon the de
mand. ,
Heretofore an application was made to
the Supreme Court for a writ of mandate
as prayed in the suit filed yesterday, but
the court held that the matter was not
one of urgency and refused to act.

DOSED THE BABY OUT
OF THE WRONG BOTTLE
MRS. LIZZIE McENTEE POISONED
HER CHILD.
Kept the Poison and the Medicine on
the Same Table and Made a
Fatal Mistake.
James McEntee, the 2-months-old in
j fant of John and Lizzie McEntee of ccl
: Elizabeth street, was accidentally pois
j oned by it? mother under circumstances
I of a peculiarly distressing character.
The child was taken sick with a bron
; chial affection and the mother obtained
! two bottles of drugs from the Pacific
: Dispensary attached to * the Children a
Hospital. One bottle contained medicine
i to be taken internally and the other a
preparation to be Inhaled and containing
a strong corrosive poison as one of its
principal ingredients. The mother placed
both bottles on a table, and when she
found it necessary to give the child some
medicine to quiet it she inadvertently
took the wrong bottle and gave the child
a teaspoonful.
When she discovered her error she has
tily summoned Dr. James V. Hughes, but
when he arrived he saw that it would
be impossible to save the sufferer. The
baby died at half past 9 o'clock on Fri
day night. The Coroner was notified yes
terday and allowed the body to remain in
the house. . â¢
What adds to the distress of the par- i
ents is the fact that this is the third of
their children that lias died within four
months. The two others had been car
ried away by pneumonia. â¢

the Spectacular
Part of Our P,p
cent Fourth of
July Procession,
o*
**ft T O matter who would gainsay it,
/\ j It must be confessed that the
I \ Chinese of San Francisco
V \ ' played the most . conspicuous
part in the procession that
marked the recent Fourth of July cele
bration. In point of numbers they were
not the strongest turnout in tho line,
but, spectacularly, they were far and
away, above every other, the moat
magnificent body. The people of this
city do not as a rule go into raptures
over things Celestial, but as the pig
tailed paraders passed in review, in all
the glory of rich trap] and bold
color, expressions of admiration were
forced from every lip along the route.
For a moment, at any rate, as the .
slangy have it, the Chinese were it. ;Â£
On previous occasions, when the na
tives of the Flowery Kingdom were
asked to participate in public specta
clesâ which asking was rareâ they took
part in a shy, tentative sort of way.
Long years of neighboring with the
citizens of San Francisco had taught
them the lesson that the more they
kept to themselves the better off they
were. The consequence was. always,
when they turned out in parade, they
were few in numbers and poor In show.
This year, how* different! It seemed
as if some modern Aladdin had rubbed
his lamp and there had issued out of
the squalor of the little China above
Kearny street a procession of genii
bearing precious gifts.
it was wonderful, but no Aladdin
had brought it about Ho Vow, Con-
Bui General of his imperial Chinese
Majesty, was the magician that ef
fected the transformation and made
the procession possible. He rubbed no
battered lamp, as did his countryman
In the wondrous tale, but he did the
things that a sensible man must do in
this waning nineteenth century to
bring about desired results. He put
his should) to the wheel â which would
be considered undignified for a man of
his station if the posture wasn't merely
metaphorical â and the Chinese pro
cession began to move. That was all
the magic there was In it, but the re
sult was just as wonderful, as far as
Ban Franciscans are concerned, as if
all the genii of all the Arabian tales
had been summoned to th task.
Knowing the predilections of his
countrymen as he did. Ho Sow had not
such a difficult task as one might sup
pose. The Celestials, above everything
else, love a procession. It is about all
the enjoyment they have outside* of fan
tan and firecrackers and a drama
pitched forever in a perennial falsetto.
From their earliest infancy they are
taught to look upon a procession as the
one evidence of mundane magnificence.
They axe born, and there isa procea^

sion; they marry, there if* another;
they die, there is still anotherâ the size
and splendor of each depending en
tirely upon the worldly wealth of the
person honored by it. On the feast days
of the lanterns and the boats and the
flowers there are processions; there are
processions for the gods and proces
sions for the devils, of which there are
unnumbered legions in China; the Em
perors are forever giving processions;
every time a dignitary, big or little,
happens along, he brings his proces
sion, and the Chinese who is not a part
of it manages, at least as a spectator,
to keep up with the procession.
All this training and knowledge and
love of -pageantry the local Chinese
were induced by their Consul General
to combine to make a showing in the
Fourth of July procession. He sent
â¢word among the merchants of China-
town and the various associations that
now was their chance to make a good
impression. lis advice was received
with enthusiasm by all. by none more
so than the parlor of the Native Sons
of the Golden State, an imitation in
yellow of the white organization of
similar name. It is made up of native
born sons of subjects of his Chinese
majesty. They jumped at the chance
and. set to work .with a will. They
spent money right and left, encourag
ing others by their example to do like
wise.
The result must have exceeded their
expectations, although the* say it is
nothing to what they can do now that
they know that their efforts will not
be frowned upon. It absolutely dazed
the American beholder and paled into
comparative significance everything
els" in lino.
The very position the Chinese page
ant held in the procession aided great
ly to heighten the effect. As was usual,
the despised race was given the fag
i nd of the line, to which place the pov
erty of their former displays had cer
tainly pointed them out. The conse
nuence was that, after the spectators
had watched the moving mass of sol
diers and sailors, gay coated bands,
native sons in regalia, cadets in natty
uniforms, squadrons of cavalry and
batteries of artillery, they were fully
prepared to believe that the best- of it
had passed. They were tired of stand-
Ing, crowded, almost surfeited and non
receptlve. They heard the squeaking*
of the approaching Chinese clarinets
and they prepared to have their teeth
set on edge with the sounds, and their
eyes assaulted with the sight of a non
descript pi-, tailed procession.
The vanguard passed and with It the
apatiy of the. spectators. Once again
they were on the gui vive, as when the
head of the parade hove into sight. A
revelation in color and glory had sud
denly burst upon their vision, the work
of Magician Ho Tow, Stalwart bear
ers, carrying a gorgeous silken carpet,
preceded the native sons in costly blue
and pleasing violet, in gorgeous cap
and buskin. Next came, still more gaily
clad dignitaries on horseback, follow
1. - long trailing dragon flags, then
others and others; groups of soldiers,
troops of runners, floats railed in with
heavy carvings of ebony and ivory,
upon which were the baby flowers of
Chinese families, arrayed in holiday
garb of .surpassing richness. More war
riors with strange banners, more car
pets, more flags trailed past, then came
the fantastically dressed actors and
Shintu priests, in palanquins, with
, coolies staggering under the weight of
portable shrines; more bands, more
warriors and then the great dragon,
rampant, writhing, menacing, like one
of those figures that mark the end of
a highly illuminated novel. It, too.
marked the end of a gorgeous moving
tale. : :.'â :, ."
And so the Chinese procession nassed
in all its kalÂ«*>"<" c copic beautyâ passed
into history as the most wonderful pa

... AN AMERICAN JOURNALIST AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE ...
THIS article is the result of a special
journey made to The Hague by Ed
ward Marshall, the well-known war
correspondent, Mr. Marshall's In
troductions and close personal ac
quaintance with the American dc_ega.es
afforded him many facilities not off-red
to other men who went to the peace coiv
ference to write, It will l"- remembered
that during the Spanish war in Cuba he
was so terribly wounded that he has prac
tically 'is: the use of his limbs, and this
Journey to The Hague (heroic in the cir
cumstances) was the first important en
terprise which he has been able to under
take since his dreadful experience on the
battle-field. He was admitted to the Pal
ace In til" Woods through special ar
rangements made by the Dutch Govern
ment and was accompanied while there
by a representative of Holland's little
Queen, while a detail of Dutch soldiers
v. as told oft to give him such physical
assistance as was necessary In getting
about the building. During his stay in
The Hague he was photographed at the
special request of the Czar. Mr. Mar
shall's wide experience In European cor
respondence, his broad Information and
bis personal acquaintance with the dele
gates make this article of more than or
dinal*) value.
Til HAGUE, Jul Câ Every Important
nation represented at the Peace Confer
ence. excepting only Germany, had a war
on Its hands when iis delegates talked
peace. Tbe United States was fighting in
the Philippines. France was lighting in
Algeria ar.d had by no means secured
peace In Madagascar. England is never
without its little wars in India and in
other of Its colonial possessions. JtusFJa
Inside of three weeks bad threcjsmn.ll in-
Burrettlqns to put down and was fighting
the natives In Chi-i-i. Holland for twenty*
five yortf. has been conducting a war in
Sumatra. While the I-'rench delegates sat
and calm.: discussed means of wiping
out liiteri.-itional warfare some of ;he.
most influential and prominent of their
countrymen in Paris were trying to over
throw the republic at home, and Presi
dent l-oubet found it necessary to call
out 15.000 soldiers to guard him while be
drove less than five miles to a racetrack.
Besides*, these actual warlike disturb
ances there rose on the horizon a blade
cloud Indicative of an armed struggle
between the English Government and the
His In South Africaâ a cloud which has
by no meiins been dispelled as yet.
Certainly there was reason for the
meeting of the hundred men who went
to The Hague to tall of peace. Ten
times their number, while they sat In
conclave there, were busy in their re
spective nations planning *.*.'.â .".
To an American layman among the
delegates it was Intensely impressive to
reflect cii the change In the position of
the United States in the family of >. a
tiers which the Spanish-American war
lias brought about, I have been much
In Europe and much with European
diplomats. 1 know that while their
feeling toward America has, in l):Â»
past, been friendly enough, they etill
failed to take us seriously. It did not
occur to them thai we were a people
likely to either help or binder their
plans. If the peace conference had
been called a year ago and our gates
had attended they would have been
treated courteously, but their opinions
would have bad little weight in tiie de
liberations of the body. As it was, An
drew D. White, Seth Low, Captain Ma
ban. Frederick D. Holls and Captain Cro
sier formed a group which was really the
center of Interest around which the
peace conference revolved. Not even the
Russian delegates, representing the mon
arch who called the conference, were re
garded by the others with the interest
, shown in the Americans.
The first question asked by a European
delegate, who bad something to propose,
was not what will Russia think of It, or
what will Germany think of it, or what
will Francs think .if it, but what will the
I": it- a States think of it?
Another interesting result of the war
was the absolute unimportance of the
Spanish delegation. Poor, broken Spain.
Her haughty hidalgos received no more
consideration than did the delegates from
'.via or Slam. As they left the door of
their apartment ln the Hotel VTeus Doe
leu they saw in the little flag nailed on
another door, almost adjoining, the sym
bol of the nation which rose through their
fall, and they went quietly to the sessions
: entirely bereft of the pompous self-im
portance which, In all tint - gone by has
marked the conduct of the Spaniard on
-uch occasions.
Spain alone of all the nations represent-
Ed, made not one single proposition to the
conference during me first three weeks of
Its existence. Even little Servla had a
message to the conference, but poor
Spain, disheartened and bowed down, did
naught but listen.
The dining room of the Hotel Vieux
Doelen is a superb apartment with a ceil
ing about forty feet from its high' pol
ished hard wood floor. At any time from
8 to 10 o'clock in the morning one of its
small tables was likely to be occupied by
one or more of the men who came here
from the land of the Stars and Stripes.
Mr. White, delicate and fragile in appear
ance, with the deep-set eyes of the pene
trating thinker, with the whitened hair
which is as much the result of unremit
ting mental toll as it Is of age, made the
final plans of the delegation's work while
he ate his simple breakfast. Mr. Holls,
tall, fat; bald-headed, good-natured, read
the amazing mail which poured in to him
as the American secretary while he
drank coffee and munched his Dutch rolls.
Captain Mahan and Captain Crozler fre
quently ate together while the secretaries
and employes of the delegation occupied
another table. The elaborate respect.
which gates from other countries
showed to the Americans was much
greater than the careful courtesy which
men of their stamp would naturally ex
hibit toward each other.
The Russians would how pleasantly to
the German del- gates, but nothing more.
and vice versa. When, however, either
passed th' American delegates or met
them in the smoking room] the salute was
sure. to be not only pleasant but profound]

ligerent governments, ar.d the measure

tions. [Joy many of these things were
pitched will be definitely known by
the time this article is printed, for this
congress will probably have adjourned by
then and the ocean telegraph will have
told the story of its closing work. But the
inside tale of how that work was done Is
never likely to be told in full, although
some interesting details can be given here.
The secrecy which was decided upon
at.il widely criticized was an absolute
necessity. The admission of working
newspaper representatives to the ses
sions of the conference would undoubt
edly have prevented the accomplish
ment of anything whatever.
There were many misunderstanding?
and mistaken reports concerning the
matter of press representatives. There
were no objections whatever to the
presence of journalists at the opening
session of the conference, but the hall
in which the meeting was held was ab
solutely crowded merely by the delegates
themselves. Their secretaries and other
employes literally could not find stand
ing room. Sixty feet above the floor of
the hall, under the very top of a dome,
is a little circular gallery. This furnishes
crowded sitting room for about eight peo
ple, and is the only place from which
the interior of the hall can be seen. It
was decided to offer this gallery to as
many journalists as could get Into It, and
the Dutch Government, which had charge
of the arrangements, out of courtesy tc
the delegates, settled upon the plan of
admitting one newspaper representative
for each of the important countries. It
was, owing to this plan, which the crow.l.

land
... ..VI.
The idta of disarmament was promptly
abandoned as Impracticable It Instantly
became apparent that not one delegato
had taken this proposition seriously, and
the conference did not even take time to
discuss it in committee. It was in these
committee meetings and not in the ses
sions of the conference that the real work
was accomplished.
It was In one of the first committee
meetings that the delegates for these
European countries which bad endeavored
to conspire against us at the time of the
Spanish-American war showed their hos
tile hands for the first and last time. At
this meeting it became evident that cer
tain governments intended to take ad
vantage of the peace conference â  to clip
the wings of the American eagle. Within
the year they had been taught that these
wings were mighty and were capable of
carrying the interesting bird not only
from ocean to ocean in his own dominion,
but wherever else he pleased to soar. This
effort on the part of Europeans to prevent
future American flights came in the shape
of a blow at America's Nicaragua canal
plan. There Is no American enterprise at
which Europe looks with more suspicion
and dread than she does at the probabil
ity of complete American control of this
proposed water highway between the two
great oceans. It fell to the lot of Freder
ick H. Holls. the secretary of the Ameri
can delegation, to discover a little Joker
in one of the propositions submitted which
might have resulted seriously. This joker
was a passage adroitly and diplomatically
â worfjod which provided for .nothing less
â¢ â Jââ. â- I v
than control by a committee of the pow
ers of all interoceanic canals in time of
war. Mr. Holls so completely and vigor
ously shattered tins bright European
dream that Europe could no longer doubt
'â â  ability of our delegates to look after
the affairs or doubt the positive certainty
of a firm stand on the part of the United
State: against anything which might in
the slightest degree prove contrary to the
interests of America.
The greatest secrecy was maintained
throughout concerning the plans of the
conference in relation to a revision of
the rules of actual warfare. Early in the
private -. -sip of the delegates came talk
about a, sensational possibility. It -â*
very generally believed by some that the
actions of Spain during the war in Cuba
would be carefully investigated by the
conference and that some of her viola
tions of the accepted rules of warfare
would be proved by testimony, which
would form the basis for new regula
tions. The fact that Spanish officers, high
ln command, ordered their troops to lire
on our Red Cross flags, that attacks had
been made on our wounded as they were
taken from f"ie battlefields, and that the
Red cress flag had been used by the
Spaniards as a mask for their batteries,
was freely commented on. The possibil
ity that I myself might be called as a
witness was early suggested by two mem
bers of one of the European delegations.
Th.- American delegation, however, imme
diately saw the Inadvisability of intro
ducing any such note of discord Into the
conference, and it was decided, in con
sequence, to avoid action of any kind
along these lines, although the delegates
all realized the necessity of some com
paratively immediate congress at which
these matters could be discussed. This
it was that gave rise to the announce
ment that a second Geneva conference
would be one of the prompt results of the
congress at The Hague.
The work of the American delegates was
never finished. It began with the rising
of the sun and ceased not with its going
down. It was the impression of many
delegates, as well as laymen, before the
conference began, that the gathering
â would be a junket, but the preponder
ence of serious design among the Ameri
can, English and Russian delegates be
came instantly apparent when the con
ference met. The English and American
delegates had evidently gone to Th*
Hague with the dignified and earnest In
tention of accomplishing something along
the lines which the Czar had laid down.
The German delegation had as evidently
gone there with the firm intention of pre
venting any useful work in these direc
tions. The Russian delegation was of
course desirous of glorifying their ruler.
The appointment by Emperor William of
Stengel, an avowed and recorded advocate
of war, was much m re seriously regard
ed by th- delegates of other countries
... ...
than they permitted the journalists to
know. This appointment, with certain ac
tions on the part of the German delegates,
quickly outlined the Emperor's policy of
obstruction. If by the time this article
appears in print some of the larger plans
of the other participating powers, notably
the establishment of a permanent board
of arbitration and mediation, have not
been finally adopted, it will have been
purely because of Germany's hindrance.
The plans of no delegation were more
frequently interfered with by Germany
than those of the able gentlemen who
represented the United States.
Russia's attitude was, of course, in
tensely interesting. It Is not likely that
any of the delegates believed entirely In
the absolute sincerity of the great "Whits
Czar. who. sitting in his palace in St.
Petersburg, had spoken through the
mouth of Count Moravleff, his Prime Min
ister. It was impossible that the Czar
should believe that all his lovely dreams
of boundary lines marked by olive
branches and loving white dove? as inter-
Italian messengers could be realized
in truth.
With all due respect for and much ad
miration of the Emperor of all the Rus
sias, it may be readily believed that his
letter to the nations Inviting the peace
conference was induced much more by a
desire to hide Russian grabs in China and
outrageous Russian oppression in Fin
land; to counteract the effect of Tolstoi's
campaign In behalf of the Russian Quak
ers and against compulsory military ser
vice, and to generally hoodwink the
world's diplomatists and politicians, than
to bring about the disbandment or* armies
and the cessation of war. But Russian
sleeves are large and commodious and af
ford much room for side issues. Up the
sleeve of the Czar was the realization that
whether or not his peace conference man
ifesto resulted in bringing about the po
litical ends which have been mentioned,
it could still scarcely fail to redound to
his own credit. What spectacle could be
lovelier than that of this reformed ruler
in his new role of the universal peace
maker?
The sessions of the conference In the
Palace of the Woods were interesting to
watch, because of their absolute lack of
formality. It might have been expected
that ihis gathering of diplomatists would
be the most formal of all bodies ln Its
procedure, but the choice of M. de Stael,
the head of the Russian delegation, as
president made this possible. De Stael
Is a weazened little old man with a ten
dency toward doddering on his legs. But
despite his age he has no tendency toward
senility in his mind. He exhibited, how
ever, some unique and eccentric Ideas of
the duties of a presiding officer. He opened
the sessions by striking his desk a gentle
rap with the gavel. There was no prayer,
there were no opening exercises whatever
except this wooden mallet's blow. Then
he sat down and left the delegates to
their own devices. There was no "getting
the floor," there were no parliamentary
practices at all. The delegates simply
talked in French, with an occasional lapse
Into their native tongues. At times, un
der this system, the conference became
a perfect Babel.
None of the sessions were lengthy, and
the way in which they were terminated
was quite as unique as the manner In
which they were opened. M. de Stael
would quietly slip out of his chair and
go away. Sometimes this merely meant
that he wished to speak to a delegate on
the floor or visit a committee room. But
if it chanced that he thought that the
gates had talked enough he did not
return. Of course, it was impossible for
the delegates to know if his absence was
to be brief or permanent without waiting
for him to come back. If. after waiting
for him a reasonable time De Stael did
not reappear, the delegates went home.
Votes were taken in the simplest man
ner possible. A motion having been read,
De Stael asked the delegates if they liked
It. Some of them said yes, some of them
â said no. De Stael gave a fairly close
guess as to the number on each side and
the fate of the motion was decided. Such
was the procedure of the Peace Confer
ence from the beginning.
There was as little ceremony about the
way In which the delegates were treated
by "the Dutch Government as there was
about the way in which they conducted
their deliberations. 'One or two official
receptions and dinners at which Holland's
charming little Queen played her part
pleasantly, as she ever does, constituted
all the official entertaining. There were
few exchanges of social visits between the
delegates.
The quarters of the American delega
tion at the Hotel Vieux-Doelen were ele
gant and commodious. It is one of the
most extraordinary structures in Europe
and dates back to about 1470. It Is at the
same time, however, much better man
aged and equipped than most European
hotels. In view of the coming of the
American delegation its owner bought a
large adjoining residence, which he
turned over entirely to our representa
tives, giving them their own entrance and
at the same time connecting them by
means of new doors and new corridors'
with the body of the hotel proper. The
rooms were furnished in the florid gold
and red which is likely to prevail wher
ever a Dutchman thinks elegance Is nec
essary. For some reason Seth Low did
not take advantage of these fine quar
ters, but went alone to the Hotel Belle
Bue, where Mrs. Low joined htm shortly
after the session of the conference be
gan.
The complete apathy of the Dutch pub-
He concerning the doings and personality
of the peace delegates was quite as sur
prising as their own lack of ceremony in
conducting the conference. Only one dele
gate went habitually to the sessions of
the conference in uniform and he,
strangely enough, was Captain < rozier,
the American attache. I believe, although
I am not certain, that some regulation
of the service made it necessary for him
to wear the sober and impressive uniform
of the United States army at the ses
sions of the conference. The Czar sent
a special photographer to The Hague for
the purpose of making pictures of the
defeffi for a great album to be kept
n the winter palace at St. Petersburg
When this photographer was at work the
foreign delegates made bright "Â£Â» J*
color in the courtyard of the \ ieux-Doe
len. Characteristic uniforms covered with
decorations and bedecked with gold lac*
appeared by the dozen, but the moment
the photographer went away the infor
mal dress which was worn at the ses
sions of the conference vt is immediately
resumed. The only decorr ions indicating
that a great international gathering was
in session at The Hague were the dozen
or so of flags whose gorgeous folds draped
impressively against the old red of the
bricks in the Hotel Vieux-Doelen's front.
They were the flags of the delegations
quartered there.
The coming of the delegates from all
parts of the earth on their tremendous
mission attracted no attention whatever
from the lay citizens of this picturesque
military ridden, gin besotten, beautiful old
town. During all my stay here I have
seen practically no manifestation of any
interest in the presence of the delegates.
A company of stupid faced Dutch sol
diers, tight trousered and Scotch capped,
with a discordant band at its head, never
failed to draw the people of Gravenha
gen from their homes and their business
places in curious mobs. But during my
stay at The Hague I have not at one
time seen more than a dozen people gath
ered to watch the delegates or do honor
to the conference.
Whatever happens before the conference
adjourns, whatever results are achieved
by it. whatever failures mark its sessions,
whatever successes are its record, the
United States of America may feel per
fectly certain that Its interests have been
guarded carefully, that its dignity has
been preserved and that its influence on
this most importnt international move
ment has been felt as strongly, if not
more strongly, than that of any other
nation represented.
While I am writing this it looks as If
practical provision for mediation and ar
bitration will really be incorporated into
international law. Hon. Seth Low. whose
influence toward good international gov
ernment has been*-exerted at The Hague
with as much earnestness as he ever ex*
erted toward the promulgation of his
ideas of government in municipal. State
or national matters at home, expressed to
me this opinion.
"It must be by the route of mediation
and arbitration that will recognize the â¢-.
terdependence of nations that the world
will progress toward the poet's dream of
the parliament of man. In the meanwhile
I think the steps likely to be taken will
depend so entirely on the voluntary ac
tions of the nations that no reaction is
to be dreaded. In other words. I think we

GUY STANDING OF
THE MILLER COMPANY
ON very few of us mortals has fate
bestowed the precious gifts nec
essary to the making of a true
artist in any one line. On fewer
yet have been bestowed those
gifts which make persons true artists in
more than one. A man or woman may
be a fine pi et cr a fine musician, but
may very rarely â almost neverâ be
both. So it Is that to be a really good
actor, and yet attain excellence in an
other line of an entirely dissimilar na
ture Is a distinction so rarely met with
as to be looked upon, when the com
bination is discovered, as partaking of
the nature of a surprise.
Guy Standing, the well-known actor,
now playing with the Henry Miller
Company at the Columbia, gives this
surprise to all who are privileged to
meet him in private life as well as see
him In the exercise of what is osten
sibly his chosen profession.
On the stage Mr. Standing delineates
character and personality in order to
procure the loaves and fishes and the
few other things that are necessary to
the existence qf a gentleman of refined
tastes and generous ideas. In hfs leis

RILEY GRANNAN AGAIN WINS FAME AND FORTUNE
,-, FTER two years of "retirement,"
Y~\ which has probably been spent in
r"j[ gathering together the scattered
remnants of a shattered fortune,
Riley Grannan returns to the track and
wins fame again â and another fortune.
Those of our readers who follow the
sporting columns, first heard of him
this season In Europe when he won
sensational amounts in pounds sterling.
Then he came back, modestly told all
about it, showed his roll of something
under a million and settled down to bet
again.
Settled down! Let the term stand.
It best describes Grannan's long, easy
loping attitude, his boyish lounge on
settee or In chair, his stride of the
seat when, in interested moments, he
tells you how he did it!
Riley Grannan, with a rollicking
â¢ Irish name as his only introduction,
came north from Paris, Kentucky,
when he was only 12 years old; and, as
he himself expressed it, has been
"knocking about with horses" nearly
ever since. His first regular start to
ward his present position was when
Botay, who la well known, especially
ln the West, as a man who "ran a
shoestring up into a bank roll," gave
him a position, and when he was 20
years old, or nine years ago, he
branched out as a full-fledged book
maker, bent on a mission of enlighten
ing the racing world.
And enlighten it he did! He made
beta with every one who had a dollar to
put up and he was as cordial to the $2
bettor as to M. F. Dwyer in the latter's
big days. A full account of his gam

who would do her duty to the last; a
woman of courage and daring. Some

matters before acting. Better financial
outlook between 45 and 50.
MR. COAKLEYâ You have worked hard
but have had poor financial results. There
was an Irregular Influence in your life
which made quite an impression. One
marriage.
MRS. A. COAKLEYâ The hand of a
hard-working, devoted mother; one who
of mortals as appeals to his sense of
the picturesque and the beautiful; and
he paints for sheer love of art, and not
for profit or prizes or the praise of
men; and, moreover, he paints well.
It is only during the past three
or four years that Mr. Standing has
done really seri is work, though from
childhood he has used pencil and brush
cleverly, without pursuing any special
method or having any special object in
view except the amusement of the mo
ment.
He has, however, exhibited pictures
both in England and Australia, and
has thus become well and favorably
known to the artistic world of both
those countries. As a child, though the
despair of the drawing teacher whose
duty it was to instruct him and his
schoolmates in the mysteries of draw
ing lines and circles and cubes and par
allelograms and the like, he was
continually endeavoring with his un
skilled little fingers to reproduce on
paper such objects and scenes as im
pressed his childish fancy; and he de
clares now that he really learned mora
through his failures and persistent ex*
bling transactions has not been pre
served.
To induce Grannan to talk to you of
his betting, if you approach him in the
right spirit, is not difficult, for there
is absolutely nothing of the "nouveau
riche" about the man. But it is im
possible to record all he tells you. His
ups and downs have been as the sands
of the sea. To him life seems to hold
no rest from the perpetual unquiet of
the betting ring and the feverish ex
citement of the gambler. Beneath the
native shyness and reticence of the man
this spirit crops out, and he is aware of
it himself.
"I like to gamble," Is a phrase he uses
repeatedly, as if seeking some self-jus
tification.
A friend says of him: "He seems to
wish to impress one that he must bet;
that it is second nature to him, and
that he is to he no more blamed for
risking his money than he is for eating.
â and there cannot be too big a B to
his 'but' â is a huge difference be
tween him and the ordinary book
maker and betting man. He believes in
the honesty of racing. He does not see
a fraud in every race, and this is the
foundation of his speculations. He
backs horses on his own opinions. An
owner mayâ frequently doesâ tell him
that his horse is not fit. If Riley Gran
nan thinks that horse can win he backs
him, in spite of what the owner or
trainer has said."
Details might be given of many Indi
vidual bets which Riley Grannan has
made. He lost $10,000 on Gloaming one
day and $3000 on a steeplechase the
same day. Pepper brought $12,000 into
his coffers; The Commoner won him
$10,000. He also won $40,000 the day
following.

perlments than he could have done
from the best masters. A birthday
present from his father of a box of
paints turned his attention to the pos
sibilities of color, and the attention of
the family also, since- he painted any
thing and everything that came in his
â way from the family bible to the front
door so long as the pigments lasted.
Designed for the navy by his parents,
fate willed otherwise, and young Stan
ding instead entered the theatrical pro
fession at the age of 18. Being of a
nautical turn of mind, however, he was
never truly happy until fortune smiled
upon him- kindly enough to warrant
him in investing some of his spare
funds in the sole ownership of a trim
built and altogether charming yacht,
the cabin of which he has had fitted up
as an ideal studio.
On this yacht, with a congenial
friend or so, Mr. Standing spends all of
the time that he is not made a prisoner
on shore by the exactions of his dra
matic work; and there he finds opportu
nity to transfer to canvas the impres
sions received by his artistic soul.
Charles Dickson, the eminent marine
has stood to win $100,000 on a day
racing, has actually come out $40,000
ahead after losing $23,000 on one race
and nearly $20,000 on another. In a few
words he looks upon a bet of $2000 .as a
mere expression of his opinion that a
horse has a good chance. He very sel
dom bets on a horse at odds on, and
says that his loss of $10,000 on a horse
last week was the first money he had
lost this way in a very long time.
"Grannan is a young man who does
credit to the great gambling fraternity.
He is a modern evolution of the old
time, high-class gambler. Such a man
stimulates business in a ring Instead of
damaging it. He maintains the prices
and makes the public bet, and with him
booking other pencilers will handle
more money on a race than they would
without him. He may die poorâ
great gamblers â but even if he
does, no one will be able to truthfully
say that he ever won money by other
than square gambling.
"It is calculated to make the ordinary
mortal gasp to talk to this tall fellow.
There, is no inclination to blow his own
trumpet, even when one is seeking to
draw him out upon what for lack of a
better word must be. called his exploits.
He mentions the loss or gain of sums
that would make a Wall-street million
aire wince with as perfect placidity as
the average bettor narrates , the come
and go of his tens or twenties."
Needless to say, his transactions have
been* vastly exaggerated. They are
every day, and will be so long as he
continues to do business on his present
scale. Hundreds have been exagger
ated into thousands, and thousands in
to tens of thousands. Talking to him
the other day, I asked whether he had
ever taken ln as much money as has
sorrow at the present time, which sorrow,
however, will not be of long duration.

While Mr. Standing has done some
extremely creditable and forceful work
in oils, his water colors have a distinc
tive charm, a warmth of tone, a truth
and a depth of suggestion rarely met

and white, particularly with the flat
and rapid drying Missini colors recent
ly brought into notice by Julian Rix
and Robert Reed, he has been strik

ticles, illustrated by himself, have been
interesting features in both English

Mr. Standing considers San Fran

picturesque scenery of our park and its
environs, and the stretch of sand

NOW THE AMERICAN BOY HAS A CHANCE
TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE NAVY
Senator Perkins' Valuable
Words of Advice.
William R. Brown of the Oregon Now Gun Captain.
WILLIAM RANSFORD
BROWN of Oakland is a
bright example of the young
American manhood on which
the future of the United
States navy depends. He has just re-
! turned to his home for a vacation, and
brings with him a commission as first
class gun captain.
Young Brown's experience in the
United States navy is just as extensive
as that of the Oregon, and just as long.
When this famous battleship first
sailed from San Francisco on her
maiden voyage William Brown of Oak
land was one of her apprentices. No
sooner had this lad entered upon the
life of a sailor in Uncle Sam's big bat
tleship than he decided to use every ef
fort to obtain promotion. His charac
ter from the first for behavior and
study v. as of the best, and when the
Government some months ago ordered
eight of the Oregon's best lads to go to
a school of gunnery in the East to pre
pare for commissions young Brown
was at once selected for one of the
number.
During the early part of the career Of
the Oregon there was nothing occurred
of particular interest, but in February
of last year, when the battleship was
at Bremerton, In the Stat.* of Washing
ton being thoroughly overhauled, no
. one' guessed that she was really being
pared for that celebrated trip
around Cape Horn to Cuba.
Young Brown during the last year of
the Oregon's history and his own has
shown in a series of letters to his pa*
rents how thoroughly one of Uncle
Sam's sailors enters upon his duties.
From Bahia, in the Brazils, young
Brown sent a brief letter touching upon
the passage to that point from this
coast; In this letter he says:
"We arrived here last night (May 8)
from Rio de Janiero to coal up and
clear the ship for action. We are put
ting on our war paint and clearing the
ship of all woodwork. This is the first
chance we have had to write. There
. Is a Spanish fleet about 200 miles north
of here waiting for us to come along.
1 think they will get all they are look
ing for. We hope to reach some Amer
ican port In eighteen or twenty days.
If we can reach the United States
without a fight we will be very lucky.
The Marietta is expected in to-day.
She has been following close behind us
â¢ all the way. This is the fourth port
we have called In since we left 'Frisco.
We stopped at Callao and at Sandy
Point and at Rio. The Oregon is now
painted .ad color, and it makes her
look very large and fierce, and I think
â when the Spanish sight her they will
â¢ think twice before hey come too near.
Ail the guns are kept loaded all the
time, so as soon as we sight a Span
ish ship we will be ready to fire. You
may not hear from me again, but if we
conic out all right I will write."
Nearly a month later young Brown
continues his log-letters from the Ore
gon, which was then at Santiago de
Cuba.
"Well, we have traveled over 15,000
miles looking for a fight with the Span
iards and did not find one until to
day. After coaling up at Key West
we joined the blockading fleet off Ha
vana. There were about ten American
warships there and we got three cheers
from all of them for our successful
trip around the Horn. As we passed
the Indiana the band played 'There's
a New Bully Come to Town,' and I
guess the band was right.
"With the New York and other ships
we at once proceeded to Santiago, leav
ing . the rest of the ships to blockade
Havana. We arrived early in the
morning off Santiago and found eight
or ten American ships there, all of
which gave us more cheers. The 'great-
Spanish Cape Verde fleet Is inside the
harbor and is afraid to come out. They
were so anxious to get at the Yankees
before the war, but since then they
have, seen some of Uncle Sam's war
ships and they have changed their
tune."
Then the letter goes on to tell about
the sinking of the Merrimac and the
bombardment of the Spanish forts by
the American fleet.
"We are still keeping up the blockade
and as soon as the troops come we will
give the Spaniards some more of Mc-
Kinley's peace-makers. You ought to
have seen the dust fly and the Span
iards, too, while we were firing."
" 'Tis an old story now, the battle of
the Nile,
But a brave story can never die of
age."
And the same Is true of the story
told by young Brown in the following
letter written while all this nation was
celebrating the great victory of which
in his unaffected language he tells:
"OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA,
"July 4, 1898.
"Dear Mother: This, is the 4th of
â¢July and we are taking a day off to
ourselves. We have done a good deal
of work in the last three days and we
need a rest. On the Ist and 2d our
fleet destroyed some of the Spanish
batteries and yesterday we completely
destroyed the Spanish fleet off San
tiago.
"It looks as though the Spanish ad
miral had been waiting for a chance to
escape, for late Saturday night there
were nine of our ships on blockade
duty off the entrance to Santiago.
About daylight Sunday (3d) four of our
best ships left for coal and ammuni
tion some thirty or forty miles to the
eastward of this place. It was a fine
cool Sunday morning, and as we were
clearing the decks for quarters and
cleaning up ourselves for Sunday In
spection, we had not the least idea that
we were in a few minutes to be in one
of the hottest naval battles of modern
times. There were only five ships left
on the blockade, and as it was Sunday
and about time for quarters, the Span

lards considered it a good opportun
ity to escape.
"The Oregon was lying ln front of the
entrance, and the other four ships (In
diana, lowa, Brooklyn and Texas)
were lined up on either side of us.
Just at 9:25 as' first call went to quar
ters the lookout reported the Spanish
fleet coming out of the harbor. We
cleared for action at once and signaled
to the rest of the ships to look out for
what was coming. There was great ex
citement for a few minutes.
'"As soon as the first Spaniard poked
her nose outside she commenced firing
at the Indiana, and we. answered her
with a broadside of six, eight and
thirteen inch shells. Soon her four big
cruisers and the torpedo boats were
outside. They headed up the west
coast of the island, close to shore, and
the Oregon and Brooklyn kept along
side of them about three thousand
yards off.
'"The torpedo boats were blown sky
high in short order. I saw one go up.
When she exploded a volume of black
and white smoke shot up a hundred
feet into the air. That was the last
seen of her and her sisters soon fol
lowed her fate. Before we went two
miles two of the Spanish cruisers were
seen on fire heading for the beach.
They went ashore within half a mile of,
each other. Shells were flying over us
like hail, but luckily none hit us and
not a man was scratched. There were
two more ships ahead of us still, and
we flew after them at the rate of
seventeen knots, firing our heavy guns
as fast as we could, and we could fire
them fast. The third one was struck
and she headed for the beach. We kept
firing as we passed her until she went
high and dry on the beach and there
was an explosion aboard of her. That
was the Viscaya, the one that could
destroy New York City so quickly. I
tell you," mother, that ship will never
enter New York harbor again.
"It was now about 12 o'clock and there
was only one ship left, the Christobal
Colon, the fastest of- the fleet. The
Oregon and Brooklyn chased her for
about two- hours, and when we saw we
were gaining on her we let a few of our
thirteen-inch bow-chasers drive at her.
One went right in front of her. It
struck a little too near to suit her, so
she headed in for the shore and after
a little more shooting hauled down her
colors and surrendered.
"When our prize crew went aboard of
her they found four dead and about
twenty wounded. She was hit a great
many times. About 500 officers and men
were put aboard tiie Resolute and made
prisoners of war. We stayed there all
night to watch her. She was leaking

hardly see her, and that was the end
of the great Cap- Verde fleet. We are
now ready for their reserve fleet if it
comes over.

more when I get paid off. Yesterday's

"WILLIAM R. BROWN."
In another paragraph of the same let
ter young Brown undoubtedly tells
some very plain truths. In answer to
a query from his mother he says: "You
asked me in your letter if my knees
knocked together when the first shot
was fired. I was not so badly scared as
all that, but I will admit that it all
felt a little queer at first. We are used
to It now. We have smelt quite a good
deal of gunpowder in the last month."
Last September there was great joy
aboard the Oregon, for it was then sup
posed that she was to be sent around
the Horn to San Francisco. "I expect
we will be there by Christmas," says
Brown. "Then you can see the ship

Done on the Oregon.
that opened the eyes of the whole
world. "Thousands of people come here
(New York navy yard) every day, and
although there are six other ships all
they want to see is the Oregon."
Then comes what at this time seemed
like a great disappointment to the
young gunner, but which was really
the stepping-stone to his future suc
cess. October 1, writing from the
United States ship Amphitrite, then at
Boston, he says: "We are not going
to Frisco. Sudden orders came from
Washington to send eight young sea
men from the Oregon to this ship to
take Instructions for gun captains. I
was one of the eight, and it nearly
broke my heart to hear that I could not
go back to Frisco with the Oregon. It
is probably for the best, but I don't like
it a bit. If we pass the examinations
we will get from $35 to $50 a month.
We are now taking daily studies at the
gunnery school, working up for ex
aminations." Â. ... ...... . . ... .
After a month -Studying and prac
ticing young Brown realized that the
change ordered in his career was for
his own benefit. "The first lieutenant
of the Oregon," he says, "has explained
the matter to me and has convinced me
that this is the best thing for me to
do if I want to get up in the navy.
I am one of fifty sent here from the
different ships in the navy. It will
take about five months to receive our
instructions and qualify, and if we pass
we will be given our rates right away.
Chief gun captain gets $60 a month,
flrst-class gun captain $50 and second
class captain $40. I am confident now
that I will get second-class, but I shall
try for first. We are sent here, I learn,
because we have all got good records,
and they will shove us along. When
we get through I can go to the Oregon
if I want to, and I want to bad enough.
We expeot to get our prize money about
Christmas, and as soon as our examin
ations are over the Government will
send me overland to Mare Island, where
I shall be paid off, as I have only
eight months now to serve."
The progress made by the Oakland
gunner was evidently very satisfactory,
for after the end of the first prelim
inary examination he only made one
error out of fifteen questions, which all
related to deck battery guns, "and,"
says he, "lt was a corker. The next
examination will be on the Lee rifle,
and I think it will be easier than the
first. We will leave here some time in
the latter part of this month for Port
Royal, S. C, for our target practice,
which will last at least two months.
It will soon be over now, and I shall
be at liberty to come home.
"In the target practice I fired sixteen
shots to-day with a three-pounder and
made t* elve bullseyes at about 1600
yards. To-morrow we will fire six
pounders and four-Inch guns, and last
of all the big ten-Inch guns. The ten
inch shells weigh 500 pounds and will
carry ten miles. We have to fire with
them at a target 3000 yards away. Our
course will finish ln a few days and we
shall know where we stand."
Recently the young Oakland gunner
passed the final examinations, and
qualified for gun captain of the
first class. "If I had got four per cent
more," he says, "I would have got
chief. We have not our appoint
ments yet as the recommendations
have been sent to Washington to be
approved. j I might leave for California
any day and I hope the next letter will
be a verbal one. I will send you a tele
gram as I pass through Los Angeles
on my way to Oakland."
A SOPORIFIC PLANT.
Mr. Gillespie of Edinburgh has called
attention to the curious soporific action
of certain plants found ln Russia and in
America.
These plants ar. known to botanists
under the name of stipa. On thÂ© Mediter
ranean coast, where the stipa grows in
profusion, it is called virgin's flax, and
because of its beautiful blossoms is used
extensively for bouquets.
In Texas and New Mexico a species of
this plant, called stipa viridula, possesses
soporific qualities. :\\ '"/.
The cowboys and herders of the West,
where the plant grows luxuriantly, often
find to their astonishment that their cows
and horses are suddenly overcome with
sleepiness, accompanied with great weak
ness. They are rendered Incapable of
traveling and cannot exert themselves
without great effort^
Horses and cows are affected alike. The
head falls low, the body trembles, the
breath comes with difficulty and the heart
beats tumultuously. Accompanying this
there .s profuse sweating exhaustion. The
poor animal seems violently sick. How
ever, in a few days his state becomes
normal again.
Strangely enough, sheep are not affect
ed by the plant.
As an experiment Mr. Gillespie Inocu
lated frogs and rabbits with an extract
from the stipa viridula. After the Injec
tions the animals were apparently seized

âthe present Is her world.
Three years ago Count Tolfskow of St.
Petersburg, Russia, sojourned for a time
in the flower-embowered city of Santa
Barbara. He was wealthy and eccentric,
and avoiding the society people of the
place spent most of his time in solitary
walks and drives. Two-score years and
fifteen had passed over his titled head,
but he forgot this entirely when he met
Clemente Ruiz.
She was a child then, not quitÂ© 17, but
the old Count, when he first saw her lean
ing lazily against the trunk of a giant
rosebush, with the pink petals of the
flowers showering down on the glossy rip
ples of her untidy hair, thought herâ as
many others have thought her sinee â
quite the most lovely creature that earth
had ever produced.
A number of her small brothers and sis
ters (she has eleven) were playing near
in the quarrelsome fashion of children,
and the stranger made friends with them
and their parents at once by throwing a
handful of silver into the group. He "liked
children" he said, in unnecessary excuse,
and then, tl â¢â  day being warm, he asked
permission to rest for a moment or two
himself under the rosebush.
He was Clemente Ruiz's first lover. And
that he was an ardent one in spite of his
years was proven by the fact that not a
day after that passed that did not find
him worshiping before her shrine, and in
cidentally bringing offerings to the high
priest and priestess, her parents.
Clemente was coy this time. Young as
she was, she had ideas of her own, and
the Count, for all his money and presents,
was not exactly the kind of a sweetheart
that a girl like her would care for. Still,
the madre liked him and the gifts he .
brought, for It was easier to accept than |
to earn, and when he took Clemente to j
walk or to drive he told her wonderful
tales of his far-off home and of what he |
would do for her and hers If she would
but consent to go with him there.
One day Clemente and her aged lover
went riding and did not return. The
heads of the Ruiz family placidly won
dered, and expressed no surprise or sor
row when they learned that the Count
had chartered a small fishing craft and
with Clemente and a minister put'straight
out to sea. That evening the truants re
turned, and announcing their marriage
departed for Los Angeles on a bridal
tour.
And now occurred that which was a
forerunner of all Clemente's after expe
riences. Once embarked upon the ocean
of matrimony, the young girl was at
tacked by a figurative mal de mer. She
had not cared much for the Count as a
lover; she cared for him still less as a
husband. All his stories of wealth and
luxury fell upon deaf ears, and the pros
pect of being an "old man's darling" in
a prison of which he was the jailer af
frighted her wild and untrammeled spirit.
She has proved since that she Is a wo
man of resources, but she began to prove
lt then. In spite of her husband's plead
ings, she betook herself straight to the
authorities of Los Angeles and stated her
case. She was not yet 17, and she was
married to a man whom she hated.
The result was swift and certain. She
came back to the paternal horne â trans
formed from a hut to a pretty cottage
through the generosity of the deserted
oneâ freed from her galling bonds, and
with sufficient money forced upon her
from the same sourceâ for the old man
truly loved herâ to keep her ln luxury for
some little time to come.
That she did not come back Into the
old life was, however, soon apparent. The
child under the rosebush had disappeared
forever. The girl had begun to know the
value of the power of her beauty, and
the romance of which she had been the
heroine brought her the notice which her
awakened vanity craved.
Only a few weeks passed before another
titled lover bent before her, a "Frenchman

oness Beaudry.
This second bridal trip took her as fat
as New York, and she seemed happy and
contented during all the long Journey, bui
when the tickets were fairly bought foi
the trip across the ocean she asked for s
stay of proceedings.
She . was quite sure, without thinking
over the matter at all, that she should
not like to travel upon the water; and she
was also sure, after having done consider
able thinking at odd times on this sub
ject, that she did not truly love thÂ© de
voted and gallant Baron.
Would he kindly excuse her, now that
she had arrived at this unpleasing conclu
sion, and continue his life's journey with
out her? And the Baron, because he was
the politest of his polite nation, did ex
cuse her, with charmingly expressed re
grets, and went his way alone.
He was not gone very long, however, be
fore Clemente began to feel lonely.
She could not recall him, even had shÂ©
wished, for he wasâ by the time that she
began to experience this, to her, novel
emotionâ far beyond the recapturing pow
er of tugboats or steam launches; butâ
there were others.
There were several others, in fact, who
merited consideration under the circum
stances, but they were further away than
the amiable and self-sacrificing Baron.
Still they were more get-at-able, and
there was a possibility that among them
there might be one whom she would like
better.
The New Yorkers she did not like at all.
though they stared at her in open admira
tion whenever she ventured to show her
lovely face outside her own apartment.
She longed for the roses and sunshine and
the gay summer guests of Santa Barbara,
with a longing that, after twenty-four
hours of restlessness, became Irresistible.
She put the few of her belongings that
she had unpacked back into her trunk in
a hurried muddle of wrinkles and cross
folds; coaxed the cover down into place
with the weight of her charming self
perched upon its curving apex, and tri
umphantly turned the key in the strain
ing lock.
Then she sent for her ticket, put on the
thickest of veils to cheat the unappreci

HEARTY JACK TAR AND THE NEW LAW
THE SAILOR BOARDING HOUSE AND DEEP SEA VOYAGES
THERE is trouble on thÂ© water
front over the shipping of sailors
for deep sea voyages, and the
boarding house masters are strug
gling with the problem of how to
respect the law and make a living
at the same time.
"Is it a berth as steward y're want
ing?" said a fat old lady sitting outside
her tumble-down establishment on the
water front.
Why she thought I would like to be a
steward Ido not know. Perhaps she real
ized I was not a genuine sailor, but only
an amateur who had strayed into a dis
trict redolent of the sea. When I haa
explained matters she poured forth hei
grievances readily enough.
"It's hard on us, and hard on the sailor,
too, this new law," she said. "Why they
say a sailor isn't to get more than a
month's advance when he ships, and with
wages at $20 what dots that amount to?
Why many a time a man comes to me,
Just as you might do, and asks to be
taken ln. He hasn't got a cent In his
pocket, nor any clothes except those on
his back. Now what am I to do? I can't
send the poor fellow away hungry. So
I take him in and feed him up well and
get him an outfit for seaâ oilskins, sea
boots, tobacco, matches and all sorts of
thingsâ so that he ships away happy and
contented and blessing his benefactors."
All this was quite a revelation to me.
I had never dreamed before that the sail
ors' boajding-house trade had Its humani
tarian side. But the benevolent old lady
explained how It is done.
'â Well, you see, perhaps we have to keep
the man, if things are slack, five or six
weeks before we can get him a ship. And
the board, with vegetables and meat at
their present prices, Is cheap at $5. Then
there's the outfit, which will run away
with $10, and there's the cash advanced
and a dozen other things. So that you

forth, bound for the home she loved as
much as she was capable of loving any
thing on earth.
Her people were glad to welcome her,
but more glad still was John Wilbur, who,
though he had seen the Circean senorita
only once or twice before Baron Beaudry
carried her away from the scene of her
conquests, had borne her fair Image in his
heart ever since.
John Wilbur w*as thÂ© son of a Pennsyl
vanian oil magnate and heir to millions,
so there could be no possible objection to
his impassioned suit from a practical
point of view even had the ex-Baroness-
Countess been coldly mercenary, which
she never was. He was, moreover, a per
sonable young fellow, educated, accom
plished and manly, and Clemente really
felt something very near akin to love for
him when she for his sake assumed for
the third time the responsibilities of mat
rimony.
For a few brief months thÂ© voting
couple were reasonably happy together.
True, young Wilbur found out, as most
newly made husbands do, that he had
married a very human woman and not an
angel, and Clemente discovered that Span
ish temper and American temper are very
much alike, save in name, and that sweet
hearts and wives stand on very different
planes after the honeymoon is over.
Things would have gone very comfortably
with them, however, and because they
were really fond of each other they would
probably have shot the rapids of early
married life in safety and found smooth
sailing in the calm waters of prosaic mat
rimonial content, had not the Wilbur fam
ily interested themselves in the matter.
John wrote them of his marriage, the
beauty of his bride and his own happiness,
see we can't afford to do it for less than
$40, two months' advance, and that's what
we've always been getting."
Certainly, judging from the appearance
of the establishment, the business is not
a very profitable one. At least it does
not run into gilding and ornamentation,
mirrors and French paintings, as does the
liquor trade. The house Is a low, tumble
down wooden shanty on some street near
the docks. It rooks as If it had never
known the meaning of a coating of fresh
paint, and the dreary looking saloons
which infest the neighborhood keep it fit
ting company. .; !.7 7
In the front room, which has that inde
scribable odor peculiar to a ship's fore
castle, half a dozen men lounge on a
rough wooden bench. They are weather
beaten and stolid, roughly clad in any
sort of old clothes. They do not talk
much, but when they speak it is in short,
jerky sentences. Their conversation is of
the sea, but not of its romance. The mod
ern Jack knows nothing of the glory of
the waters; he only realizes the hard
ships of the life. He talks of his last
trip and of the ill-treatment meted out to
him.
Next voyage lt will be just the same
thing, but in the meantime Jack is con
tent to smoke his short pipe and wait
patiently until the time comes for him
to ship. For he is entirely in the hands
of the boarding house keeper, and knows
that he may at any moment be thrown
penniless into the streets with no refuge
to turn to. No other boarding house
will take him in; there is a mutual un
derstanding between thÂ© keepers. So
that the Â©ailor must perforce accept the
first ship offered, no matter whether shÂ©
be good or bad; even if she be one of
those "hell" ships which leave behind
them at each port a fresh record of bru
tality and bloodshed.
For the present, at any rate, the sailor
is fairly well treated and fed. In thÂ©
but even staid Philadelphians listen to
gossip occasionally and disquieting ru
mors had come through other channelÂ©
to the Wilbur home.
So it was that the Wilbur family an
nounced austerely that they did not ap
prove of young Mrs. John. They did not
care to mix their petroleum with Spanish
blood anyway, but when the lady of
John's choice proved not only to be Span
ish but to have been the heroine of two
other romances previous to her introduc
tion into their sacred circle she became
simply impossible. Father and Mother
Wilbur declined to receive her. They in
formed the youthful benedict of that fact
and Implored him to desert the girl ho
had chosen and return to the bosom of
his relations. As an incentive to obedi
ence they shut off his allowance. That
plan, however, did not work for a time.
John Wilbur was still charmed enough by
his wife's beauty to contemplate with
equanimity the prospect of love in a
Spanishtown 'dobe if need be.
Clemente, though, was different. She
was not troubled much about the money
part of the affair, but her spirit rebelled
at the attitude of her husband's people
toward her; and then, besides, she was
tiring of him a little. A certain John
Harper, son of W. W. Harper, the weal
thiest stockbroker in Cincinnati, had ap
peared upon the scene, and Clemente be
gan to think ruefully that she had been
rather in a hurry, after all, in the Wilbur
affair, and might have done better had
she waited a little.
The result of ail this was that when a
letter arrived offering the 17-year-old wife
a handsome sum to eliminate herself from
the Wilbur equation she viewed the
proposition with favor.
long, low dining room at the back the
steward is spreading the table for sup

is no napery to bother with; the table is
simply covered with oil cloth, a cup
and saucer and plate Is dumped down
opposite each place. Huge piles of bread
and great joints of beef are placed at
Intervals, and all Is ready. From the
kitchen adjoining rises an odor of savory
stew, and soon the men come trooping In
take their seats on the long wooden
benches. Chairs seem to be an unknown
luxury ln this part of the world.
It is all very rough and primitive, but
still not without a certain homely com
fort. To a sailor half starved for four or
five months on hard tack and salt horse,
the fare must seem positively luxurious,
and it is no wonder he waxes fat and is
loth to leave the shelter of his well
supplied boarding house. Yet, If the new

sent to sea without an outfit at all and
will be compelled to call upon the ship's
slop chest and to pay any price which
the skipper may choose to demand. The
fact that he will have more money com
ing to him at the end of the voyage will
not help him much. The usual spree on
landing may be * slightly prolonged ; that
is all. In the end Jack will fall back
penniless, just as he does now, upon the
boarding-house keeper. .
The long' and the short of It is that
all these attempts to ameliorate the lot
of the sailor by legislation are bound to
prove futile. The shipping laws are made
by representatives who know nothing
whatever about the sea, and hence are
more likely to do harm than good. Thus
the new Federal law which came Into
effect last month, though on paper .; it
looks an admirably designed enactment,
is likely to defeat its own object There
Is a most elaborate sealÂ© . of provisions
A few days after there was a romantic
elopement. John Wilbur played the role of
the prodigal son successfully and Mr. and
Mrs. John Harper appeared in Cincinnati
dazzling all beholders with the sight of
youth, beauty and happiness set in a
massive frame of glittering wealth.
Clemente soon learned to spend money
as energetically and industriously as her
fourth husband, and between the two they
managed to make quite a litttle dent In
the family funds before Harper decided
not to spend any more money at all.
Clemente looked utterly enchanting In
mourning, and so chastened was her
spirit by her sudden bereavement that
she even let her lovely eyes rest with tol
eration upon a resident of the State which
she had formerly despised.
Albert Rice was a young business man.
His father was one of the senior members
of the long established and Influential
firm of Hunt, Rice & Almy of Albany, and
he himself held a responsible and lucra
tive position in the house. He had all the
assurance, dash and personal magnetism
necessary to a successful business career,
but he forgot business entirely when he
met Clemente Ruiz Harper.
Her beautiful face dawned on his mental
horizon like the sun of morning. No
music had ever sounded so sweet to him
as the soft tones of her caressing voice
and the dear litttle Spanish accent which
made her speech so delightfully different
from that of any other woman whom he
knew.
â¢ If she looked like a houri in garments of
woe, how would she look in a garb of the
delicately lovely tints which fashion de
crees for the gowning of widow brides?
He had a mind to solve that problem if
the fates would be kind. The grim sisters
for the mariner. Including everything
from canned tomatoes to molasses and
dried fruit. But only the simpleton im
agines '.bat the crew, once the ship is
well on the high seas, will get any of
these luxuries. Many recent cases have
shown how utterly futile It is for the
sailor to appeal to our courts for redress,
and practically, law or no law, he is at
the mercy of the captain and officers,
who may treat him well or 111, just as
they choose.
It is here that the striking diifference
between American and English sailing
vessels is shown. Hardly a Yankee ship
comes Into port without complaint being
made by the crew against the officers.
We hear terrible tales of brutality and
starvation, of hazing "bucko" mates and
embalmed rations. The public has grown
to accustomed to these horrors of the sea
that no one pays them much attention,
and our law courts never Interfere. The
result is that the name "hell" ship has
'become a reproach against our American
deep water vessels.
On the â¢other/hand, one rarely hears of
trouble on board the English sailing ves
sels, which come in such numbers to this
port. Yet both classes of ships are manned
by exactly the same kind of crew. The
American sailor has practically ceased to
exist, and the men who now go to sea
are a cosmopolitan lot, made up of sweep
ings from every race under the sun, from
Dagos to Russian Finns. The English
Board of Trade scale of provisions is less
liberal than that ordered by the United
States law, and the English forecastle is
certainly less comfortable than on most
American ships. Why then should there
be such a difference?
The reason lies, not in the law, but In
the method of Its enforcement. - The Eng-
lish captain or mate knows that he must
respect the law, or else at' the end of his
voyage he will. find a stern, unbending
Consul ready to 7 investigate any com
were gracious and Clemente, after a few
short weeks of deepest gloom, came out
into the sunshine again.
She made, as usual, a charming bride,
and Mr. Rice considered himself for some
little time the happiest of men. Clements
was not domestic, and he discovered after
a little that she had other little idiosyn
crasies which he as a loving husband was
bound to overlook. She was far from be
ing ignorant of the power of her beauty
by this time, and her love of admiration
had become a trifle too pronounced to be
pleasant, even to a husband who adored
her. She could not resist giving a glance
of her lovely eyes under their long black
lashes, and a half-shy, half-alluring smile
of her pomegranate lips to any present
able man who was bold enough
to take second look at her iv
spite of the Cerberus constantly
at her side. Oddly enough, Al
bert Rice, knowing as he did that he was
number five on his wife's list of persons
whom she had sworn to love, honor and
obey, could not reconcile himself to the
idea that any one else should look at her
with any save artistically abstract admir
ation now that she was his wife.
Since he could not expect In the nature
of things to be her Alpha, he wished to be
her Omega. To tell thÂ© truth he was ut-
terly, and, at first, unreasonably Jealous,
and Clemente soon began to rebel at his
unkind suspicions and unremitting espion
age. There was enough of the undisci
plined child about her still to make her
desirous of doing exactly what she was
ordered to leave out of her scheme of ex
istence, and it was not long before she
began to flirt most abominably whenever
opportunity offered. Then came quarrels,
at first slight and easily made up, and
then so severe as to cause not a little mild
neighborhood gossip. And then one day
young Madame Rice packed her trunk
againâ this time neatly and deliberatelyâ
and went off on a western trip with only
her maid for company, because, as she
averred, she found the Eastern climate
far too changeable and severe for her Cal
ifornia-bred constitution, and felt that she
needed change of air and scene. â¢
Fancy apparently, but Fate most assur
edly, led her to exercise the privilege of
her stop-over ticket In Austin, and there
at the hotel table she became aware of an
admiring gaze, even more earnest than
those to which she was by this time ac
customed,, and looking up met the bold
eyes of Will S. Hauk, the famous Texan
stockman, plunging straight into her own.
It was a case of love, or, rather, irre
sistible attraction on both sides this time,
and a few days later Albert Rice was no
tified that he need never expect his wife
to return to him, since she had found
some one whom she liked far better and
with whom she hoped to spend the re
mainder of her life in peace and hap
piness.
After her fifth husband gave up all
claim to her the peace and happiness last
ed only a very few weeks. Hauk was
used to dealing with cattle and cowboys,
plaints the sailors may choose to make.
In fact, it does not pay to ill treat sailors
on British ships; the consequences are too
serious. Exactly the reverse applies on
American vessels. Secure from punish
ment, the brutal mate may haze and drive
as much as he will, the captain gives tacit
approval, and justice, as represented by
the law courts or Consuls, is conveniently
blind. -."" ".'."-
A leading boarding-house master, whom
I asked for an opinion, surprised me by
saying that nowadays American ships
were run more cheaply than British.
"Why," he remarked, "for deep sea voy
ages they only pay thel same rate of
-â¢wages, they spend far less In port and they
do not feed the crew any better, if as
well, as the Britishers. On the other
hand, they get much more work out of
the men. This Is the reason why there
are so few American-born sailors to be
found on our ships to-day. The occupa
tion is too hard and ill paid, and no young
man of independence will choose it in
preference to a shore life."
The new law, as I have explained, Is
not likely to help the sailor much. In
stead of allowing him to draw two
months' pay, or $40, in advance, it will
limit him to one month's pay. But the
law does not fix the rate of remuneration,
and here is the loophole for evasion. In
New York they tried the plan of raising
the wages to $30 a month; on this coast
. they propose to .lower them to $15. That
is to say, the sailor will only get $15 and
the ship will pay the other $5 to the board
ing-house keeper. Thus, If the voyage
lasts four months the sum advanced will
come to $35, as very nearly the same as
under the old system. Jack will neither
be better nor worse off than before; the
boarding-house and saloon will get his
earnings, just as ever, and we will only
have another object lesson of the useful
ness of this class of legislation.

Mexican spurs, with a big whip In his
hand, his legs adorned with shaggy chap
arrajos, and a silver-trimmed sombrero
glued to the top of his self-willed head,
is not an altogether pleasing object to
gaze at unremittingly.

the novelty of it all; then she yawned,

Al Truax, a notorious follower of thÂ©
races and the heaviest player at Latonia,
made his appearance at the golden mo
ment when those glorious dark eyes for
got their wifely duty, and presto, change!
Mr. Hauk was left to run his stock ranch
alone without bothering over or caring for
a wife who preferred to delegate that
pleasant duty to a younger and hand
somer man.
The race track life suited her for a
while. She liked the noise and confusion
and uncertainty of it, but her temper did
not improve under ex-clty conditions, and
when she discovered that her husband
was no more true-hearted than herself
she made some unamiable remarks about
vivisection and hied herself away to pas
tures new. To speak truly, she retired to
a ranch in Southern California, where
Charles Williams, the owner, made her
queen of his whole extensive domain.
Both she and Truax were equally anxious
for a separation, so that episode was eas
ily closed.
Ranch life was decidedly dull, however,
after/the excitement of the race track; lt
was even duller than the stock farm had
been, and so Mrs. Williams after i endur
ing it for a month or so developed a con
suming homesickness which nothing
short of a visit to her childhood's homo
could assuage.
Once ln Santa Barbara again her fancy
lightly turned to thoughts of a certain
â ea captain who had patted her on thÂ©
head ln her bare-legged youth and ad
mired her from a distance in thÂ© yearÂ©
sineÂ© then.
After all, constancy is thÂ© onÂ© earthly
Jewel that time does not dim, decided
she; and Mr. Williams thoughtfully - ef
facing himself at this opportune period,
she set sail on the barkentine of Cap
tain J. Ellis, and made him thÂ© envy of
Eureka by allowing him to announce her
as his bride on their arrival there.
She had discovered on "her trip, how
ever, that seasickness was a decidedly
unpleasing experience, and she was not
by nature calculated to make a name for
herself In the annals of martyrdom. For
the moment she was pleased with the cli
mate and people of Eureka and elected
to make her home there while the bold
captain plowed the main back to his
home port. 7 7-7
The captain should have known better
than to leave her to her own devices, but
he didn't. He went off trustfully, think
ing himself one of the luckiest of men to
have won so fair a flower for his own and
planning for the pretty little home ha
would build her as soon as he had madÂ©
a voyage or two more. When he camÂ©
back to the northern city his ungrateful
bird had flown and with her had gona
Charles Emery, a jeweler of polished
manners and a ready tongue. Being a
philosopher in his own way, as seafaring
men are apt to be, the captain hid his
chagrin under a mask of Indifference and
bade the fugitives godspeed.
Disaster followed them, however, and
for the first time luxury loving ClementÂ©
experienced the inconveniences of lack of
money. A. S. Krump, a San Francisco
drummer, sympathized with her in her
misfortunes and won a small bit of what
she was pleased to call her heart. ShÂ©
quarreled with Emery, forced him to
leave her and rewarded the drummer for
his friendliness in her time of trouble by
becoming Mrs. Krump.
For three or four months the heroine of
eleven matrimonial ventures rested quiet
ly under this far from euphonious appel
lation and then her soul rebelled. Her
husband was at home very little anyway,
! and during his absence she had plenty of
time to think over matters in general and
her absent spouse In particular, and shÂ©
came very quietly and seriously to thÂ©
conclusion that she â unfortunate that she
was â had made another mistake.
Mr. Krump agreed with her cheerfully
when she presented this view of the case
to him and agreed to release her from
all obligations to him whenever she
wished him to do so.
She wished immediately, he found, and
so back again she went to Santa Barbara.
Her adventures and unsettled life and her
illness had dimmed her beauty not a lit
tle and she found to her chagrin that
she was not the idol that she had been
only so short a time ago. She was still
handsome enough to be unusually at
tractive, however, but her record was a
trifle against her in the estimation of
even the most enthusiastic of beauty wor
shipers.

Mrs. Klett's own nationality began to
make love to her in true Spanish style,
which was a welcome novelty to her even
after her many varied experiences in thÂ©
gentle art of courtship. Klett, being an
unobtrusive and mild-mannered man, did
not argue the matter. Clemente was no
help in the barber shop any way, and shÂ©
was inclined to flirt with the customers.
If Charles Coto wanted to marry her
he was quite welcome, so far as he was
concerned, provided there was no unpleas
ant notoriety about the matter and the
gentle current of his business was not in
terrupted by their proceedings.
-. So it is that the little Spanish girl who
stole aged Count Tolfskow's heart under

purchased by an Englishman, and for a
time flew the Union Jack instead of the
Stars and Stripes. During the period of
the Civil War the America's sailing quali
ties tempted a syndicate to purchase her
for use as a blockade runner. During this
period the yacht lurked about the Florida
Keys and made flying trips to Bermuda
ana Nassau. Finally she was caught ln
the St. Johns River and was scuttled ln
order to save her from capture. She was
raised and became a training ship at Ann

she had originally won. She had won it
against a fleet, and in 1870 a fleet was sent

The America beat the Cambria, but she
was preceded by three other American
yachts at the finish, the Magic, the Idler
and the Silvie. After the race the Amer

her duties as a training ship. Three years
later she was condemned by the Govern

hands of his son, Paul Butler.
The America was built by George

This did not mean that she taught them

in short from such a mother one would
have expected a poetic or musical son,
rather than a son with military and po
litical talents like Napoleon or Wash
ington.
Among literary men the parentage of
Richard Brinsley Sheridan is especially
Interesting. His father belonged to a liter
ary family, and his mother in herself was
a woman of great literary talent. In 1739,
when but 15 years old. she had published
a two-volume novel, "Eugenia and Ade
laide," and in the course of years other
romances and many plays came from her
pen, several of which had considerable
notoriety. Some one has, said that she is
the only literary woman who ever won a
husband by the use of her literary gifts.
Nor Is this far from the truth, since a
pamphlet which she wrote on his side of
the controversy growing out of some the
atrical matters in Dublin led to her ac
quaintance and subsequent marriage
with Thomas Sheridan.
Her daughter, Mrs. Le Frann, was a
woman of talent, and her son, Charles
Francis, as well as Richard Brinsley,
showed great ability, while numerous
descendants of hers, like Mrs. Norton and
Lord Duf_erin, have - been distinguished

was to bo a great international assem
blage of yachts at Cowes. Many raceÂ©
were arranged "for. The America was sent
over to represent the nation which had
built her and whose name and colorÂ© sho
bore.
From the moment of her arrival at
Cowes she became an object of ourioslty
and apprehension, and on one pretext or
another the British yacht owners hesi
tated to accept the challenge which Com
modore Stevens issued to the world. Fi
nally the challenge was accepted and thÂ©
race was sailed on Friday, August 22, 1881,
Shortly after 9 o'clock on Tuesday morn

enough, with her long, low, black hull,
her breadth of beam and her thick, stiff
looking rakish masts. Pitted against her
were fourteen yachts, of which six were
schooners and eight cutters. Among these
were the flower of the English sporting
navy, the choicest products of trans-
Atlantic shipbuilding skill. At 10 o'clock
the signal gun was fired from the club
house. Before the smoke had well cleared
away the fleet was under way, moving
steadily to the east with the tide and a
gentle breeze. The only laggard was the
America, which did not move for a second
or so after the others. Steamers shore
boats and yachts of all sizes buzzed along
on each side of the course and spread
away for miles over the rippling sea.
If the British heart leaped with a mo
mentary exultation over the slowness of
the America In getting under way it was
only momentary. She soon began to creep
up on her opponents, passing some of the
cutters to windward. In a quarter of an
hour she left them all behind, save only
the Constance, Beatrice and Fairy Queen,
for their literary ability.
The mother of Goethe, If not a woman
of genius, at least had great influence on
her son's Intellectual development. She
was only 18 years old when her son was
born, and she was always his affectionate
companion. Though not a learned woman,
she had a fine, poetic Imagination, and
she told him all kinds of interesting and
folklore stories.
She also improvised many tales, and
continuing them from night to night,
would stimulate the little boy to tell her
what the probable conclusion would be.
She had a lovable and loving disposition
with a capacity for bringing out each
person's best. Goethe owed much to the
strict training of his father, who was a
rigid disciplinarian, and there may have
been a germ of genius latent In the mind
of both parents. Yet certainly a great'
deal of his poetic genius was due to his
Inheritance from the mother, as well as
to her cultivation of hi* imagination.
A deeply pious man is Veldom the son
of an irreligious mother. Cases innu
merable could be given to illustrate this,
but none more striking than that of Lu
ther. It is not that we know so very
much about her, but all that we do know
shows her to have been a woman of very
decided character. She was a peasant
woman accustomed to the hardest labor.
Yet she and her husband encouraged in
their little Martin a love of study, so
that af 6 years of age he could read and
write with ease. Every little fault was
sternly dealt with, and once for stealing
some little thingâ not, we may be sure a
real theftâ mother beat him with a
hazel rod until the blood flowed.
"I shudder when I think what I went
through," he wrote once. "I had a terri
ble time of it, but she meant well."
The modern method of sparing the rod
cannot be called a bad one, and yet who
can say that Luther did not owe much of
his nobility of character to the strictness
of his early bringing up. â¢ > <â ->â â  â¢

which were well together, and went along
smartly with the light breeze. In another
quarter of an hour she was clear of them
all. Off Sandown Bay, the wind freshen
ing, she carried away her jibboom, but
as she was well handled, the mishap pro
duced no ill effect, her competitors gain
ing a trifle, but not approaching her.
From the moment she rounded St. Cath
erines Point the race was practically over.
When finally she reached the starting
vesel, at 25 minutes to 9 p. m., there was
no competitor in sight. The news reached
Her Majesty the Queen on board her
yacht.
"Who is second?" asked the Queen.
"Your Majesty, there is no second,"
said the messenger.
This was true at the moment, but 20
minutes later the Aurora arrived at the
stakeboat, and was awarded second
honors.
So ended the first great international
yacht race in victory for America, and
this story has been repeated up to the
present day. Sufficient for the day is the
Every one remembers how much John
Wesley owed to the encouragement of
his mother. Susan Wesley was a woman
of almost masculine mind, well-trained
in Greek. Latin, French, mathematics and
logic. She was so Independent that when
a girl she left the dissenters for the
Church of England, although her father,
as a nonconformist minister, had suffered
much for his dissent.
Married at the age of 19, she had nine
teen children. Thirteen of these lived
through childhood and ten to maturity.
She educated her children herself and
brought them up in a strict and loving
discipline. Undoubtedly John Wesley in
herited his own strength of character
and religious fervor from his mother. She
encouraged without at first sharing her
son's peculiar views. Indeed, it was not
until she was past 70 that she professed
herself a convert to Methodism.
Sometimes a talented mother does not
find her talented son altogether satisfac
tory. Agnes Burns, the mother of Rob
ert Burns, though a simple cotter's wife,
had a mind well stored with ballads,
which she was ln the habit of reciting to
her little boy, and by means of which she
probably developed his love of poetry.
Mothers with a bad influence over their
talented sons have been numerous, and
hardly any instance is more famous than
that of Lord Bryon and his 111-tempered
mother. In this case, too, it is difficult to
trace the genius of the poet to his moth-'
er, who, in every way, seems to have been
an ordinary woman. There was insanity
in her family, and her father was a sui
cide. Remembering this, we may see in it
something to confirm the modern theory
that genius is often degeneracy following
vice or mental eccentricity, and of both
qualities Bryon's ancestors had a fair
share. :-i~ : â¢
To emphasize the influence of the moth
erâphysiologicallyâon the child is rather
unnecessary in these modern days, when
every one one has his quota of scientific
knowledge. But it would be quite worth
while for readers of biography to note
every case where the mother's influence

The Columbia, America's new cup de
fender, satisfied her owner, Commodore
Morgan, and\ Designer Herreshoff by
beating tin- Defender 3 minutes and S3
seconds over a thirty-mile course on July
6, although the race was an unsatisfac
tory one, owing to a bad. lumpy sea and
baffling winds. This race was simply a
tryout for the yacht. Since that time she
has beaten the Defender in several races,
under varying conditions the official trials
will come off some time in September.
The nautical sharps who witnessed the
race are of the opinion that the English
challenger will be unable to take the cup
from this side of the water. . -A *
The Columbia is carrying a more true
fir-keel than the Defender, which gives
her a great deal more stability and better
windward qualifications. Experts agreed
that owing to the character of the keel
carried by the Defender, which was of the
bulbed and rocker typo, in her race with
the Valkyrie 111. in 1895, she did not work
A TREE THAT WAS LOST FOR THIRTY YEARS
THINK of a tree being lost for thirty
years.
It hardly seems possible, but that
is just what happened to a tree ln
Wooden Valley, Napa County.
The tree in question is the property of
Uncle Sam. In 1868 he sent out a large
exploring party to run a base line across
Napa County.
But when the settlers began moving In
there a few years later they found that
they could not accurately locate the cor
ners of their sections of land because they
could not find the "bearing tree" that was
the key to the whole problem.
But 'last, week the field class from an
engineering school were out studying in
that section. One of the lessons consisted
in running a level across a certain line
and finding the corners of the different
sections of land.
This work was done for several miles
and all the bearing trees found without
any difficulty by the young engineers.
But finally they came to a certain old
oak tree and the calculations showed that
it should mark the corner of a quarter
section. But there was no mark on it. It
looked like any other tree. .
"We must have made a mistake in run
ning our line," said one of the boys. But
a wiser one made a careful examination
of the bark of the tree and finally found
a slight depression about six feet from
the ground.
"I think the mark Is under there," said
he, and taking an ax began to chop. "The
bark must have grown over the mark
soon after it was made."
He cut through nine inches of bark un
til the. solid wood of the tree was reached
and there, sure enough, were the longed
for markings of the Government engl-
neers:
. "Quarter section bearing tree," he
shouted. "That's what we are looking

well to windward, and showed a tendency
to carry a lee helm. The new defender's
lead keel weighs about 95 tons, and is
more the shape of a plate than a ouib.
The advantage gained by giving the Co
lumbia a plate-shaped keel instead of the
bulb type is principally in the sail-carry
ing power. It also allows her to cut the
water more easily.
The sail area of the Columbia is 13,800
feet. This is the largest spread of canvas
ever placed on a racing cutter. The Val
kyrie 111. carried 13,000 feet, and the De
fender 12.600 feet.
Her approximate dimensions are:
Length over all, 131 feet; water line, â__
feet; beam, 24 feet 2 inches; draught. 20
feet.
The length of the mast is 107 feet 6
inches; 22 feet in the masthead and S
feet below deck and 77 feet from deck to
hounds, where the Defender measures but
72 feet. The topmast measures 63 feet.
The bowsprit extends outboard 27 ftet.

measurement is 73 feet. The distance
from the water to the tip of the club top
sail Is 175 feet. Therefore it would be im
possible to sail this yacht under the
Brooklyn bridge, because a mast 140 feet
high just clears the bridge.
The launching of this beautiful craft
on June 10 was the occasion of a holiday
at Bristol. The shore on both sides of the
shops where she was built was black with
people, as were also the roofs of the shops.
Crafts of all descriptions decked in gay
colors, dotted the immediate waters of
the bay. At exactly 8:16 Mrs. C. Oliver
Iselin christened and started the new
yacht from her cradle down the slight
incline to the water. Cheer after cheer
arose as her keel struck the water, and
she seemed to bow gracefully In acknowl
edgment of the reception. It is estimated
that at least five thousand people wit
nessed the launching. This is twice the
number that saw the Defender take her

JUANlTAâCorrosive sublimate is, I
think, an ingredient of the cream you
have been using. This, as you no doubt
know, is a deadly poison, but used in a
small quantity, ln combination with other
materials, acts on the skin as an imper
ceptible blister, gradually eating away the
outer cuticle. It acts like a charm with
some akins, but not with others. I never
advise it. as I consider its use risky. And
you, my dear little girl, are altogether too
young to be using such things on your
skin anyway. Why, at your age, life is a
beautiful thing, and you ought to be just
squeezing happiness out of it, instead of
worrying about such a trivial thing as a

SOLE SURVIVING SENATOR OF FIFTY YEARS AGO TALKS ABOUT PAST ISSUES
OF the men who were prominent in
public life fifty years ago James
W. Bradbury of Maine, then a
United States Senator, alone sur
vives. He celebrated his ninety
seventh birthday a few days ago,
and is still ln good health. He attended
the reunion of the Bowdoin College class
of 1825 and was apparently ln perfect
mental condition.
Mr. Bradbury recalled how, Just fifty
years ago, on the Fourth of July, there
was a great celebration over the victory
In the Mexican War, tinged with doubt
as to what should be done with the terri
tory acquired. The question then was be
tween slavery and anti-slavery, and the
feeling was far more bitter than it Is
now between expansion and anti-expan
sion. Yet there is something akin be
tween the two questions, since both arose
Maurice Gram Wants Opera in English
Strange Reason Why He Can't Get
Itâ Unusual Talk With the Boss
of Grand Opera, and Inter
esting Facts About
Him.
From a Staff Correspondent of The Sunday Call.
LONDON. July I.â Of course the most
powerful figure In grand opera to
day is Maurice Grau, citizen of the
world. It is supposed here that he
lives in London. Parisians have a
general idea that he is one of them,
and lt Is understood in -America that he
is a resident of New York. Similarly, al
most every one who Is interested In such
matters supposes that every one else In
the . same category knows something
about the man who controls the orbits
of nearly all the stars of the first mag
nitude in the operatic firmament, puts
them under an eclipse when he chooses,
introduces a comet occasionally by way
of variety, and, in short, runs the whole
show.
For a man whose work is so interesting
to the general public singularly little is
known about him. Just now he is a part
of Lo.-don, and is settled in an attractive
flat in Portland place, with James Bryce,
author -if "The. American Common
wealth," ior a near neighbor. There is
nothing gorgeous about the flat, but lt
is so comfortable and homelike and bright
that one seeing it would suppose the ques
tion of Mr. Gran's place of residence to
be answered. But it appeared, after put
ting the question to him, that he Is only
dwelling in London, whereas he is an act
ual resident of New York, although his
home is in Paris. That seems plain
enoughâ an admirably simple solution of
the mystery. "I have a house out ln the
suburbs of Paris," he added, "and I sup
pose that really must be my home, be
cause I am almost never there."
It was rather early in the morning and
the famous entrepreneur was working
over a dozen big white envelopes laid out
In nice rows on his dining-room table.
They looked as if they held contracts,
and" naturally suggested questions about
the coming American season. "We begin
earlier than ever before," said Mr. Grau,
"sailing the middle of September and
opening possibly in San Francisco.
We shall take in half a dozen cities on
the way back to Chicago, which hitherto
has been the western terminus, and ar
riving In New York to open the season at
the Metropolitan Opera-house on Decem
ber 18." 7 r :
Jean de Reszke will be missed from the
company this year, but, on the other
hand, Emma Calve will be back in her
place again, and after a year spent chief
ly in designing her own tombstone and
otherwise indicating that her nerves were
in bad condition. She Is as well as ever
now and in a hurry to get back to the
land of dollars.
The season drawing to a close at the
Royal Opera-house ln Covent Garden will
probably bring the Prince of Wales and
the other distinguished stockholders a tidy
Interest on their money, for it bids fair to
be the most successful season on record
there, like the last season at the Metro
politan Opera-house ln New York. It
probably will help Mr. Grau, also, toward
the achievement of an ambition he has
held for many years. "Operatic managers
usually retire bankrupt, and I do hope I
can prove an exception to the rule," said
he, "Yes, I should like to go to my house
ln Paris and write my memoirs. Perhaps
I shall some day, although I don't know
that I could write well enough to Interest
the public, but certainly I've had experi
ences enough In theaters in every part of
the globe except in Australia."
It took much questioning to persuade
Mr. Grau to eke out some of his autobiog
raphy. It seems that he has been mostly
an American for the last forty-five years,
having landed In New York trom Europe
at the tender age of five. He was cut out
to be a lawyer, so his parents thought,
and after he was graduated from the col
lego of the city of New York at the age of
20 they insisted that he should go to the
Columbia Law School, although he had

out of foreign warsâ the only ones we
have had with non-English speaking
peoples.
Mr. Bradbury spoke freely about the
Issues of 1849, when he was a Senator.
The Senate which met ln December of
that year was, according to the best tes
timony, the ablest that ever sat in Amer
ica. Among its members were Webster,
Clay, Calhoun, Douglas. Shields, Benton,
Seward, Cass, Davis of Mississippi, Gwyn,
Cooper, Soule, Mason, Hunter, Walker,
Dodge of Wisconsin, Dodge of lowa, Han
nibal Hamlin. Truman Smith, John Bell,
Atchison, Sturgeon, Greene, Houston,
Berrien, Corwin, Jones, Felch, Chase,
King, Baldwin, Yulee, Underwood, Foote,
Hale, Dickinson, Mangum, Butler. Rusk
and John Davis of Massachusetts, while
the House of Representatives contained
names almost as famous.
discovered by that time that he didn't
care much for law and that he did care
a great deal for the theater. He studied
lav.- at Columbia with Edward Lauter
bach, and, like Lauterbach, might have
cut a figure in politics later if, after grad
uating from Columbia, the theater had not
got the better of Blackstone.
"You see," said Mr. Grau, "my uncle
was an operatic manager ln New York at
that time, and I was always hanging
around the theater. I began my theatrical
career low on the ladder. The first work
cf that sort I did was selling librettos ip
my uncle's theater in New York the old.
French Theater, now the Fourteenth
street. That was In 1866, when Ristori was
playing there. I was at school then. After
deserting the law, much to my parents
disgust, I held about every position that
one can hold in the theater except on tho
stage. I was never on the stage in my
life. I have been about everywhere, from
Panama north and from St. Petersburg
west. It was thirteen years ago that I
began to work along toward the present
line by becoming acting manager for
Henry E. Abbey. The next year I became
a partner."
London is much interested In a plan that
has been brought before the Government
for the establishment of a national opera,
to be subsidized by the Government. Al
though the plan Is rather vague, it has
gone far enough to Indicate that some
step of the sort is likely to be taken be
fore long. I asked Mr. Grau what he
thought about it, and his answer and the
train of thought to which It led are rather
significant for the future of grand opera
if Mr. Grau is to remain Its king bee.
"If," he said, "national opera means
operas by the best composers of whatever
nationality, sung in English by the best
artists available, of whatever nationality
then I am so heartily in favor of it that I
would want to try it in America the next
season if circumstances would permit. In
theory there Is no good objection to grand
opera in English, and there are sound ar
guments for it. Even the Wagner operas
would be enjoyed better by the general
public if sung in English, and how vastly
more enjoyable to all but a few would be
an opera like 'Don Giovanni' If sung in
English.
"Yes, I can say unreservedly that if cir
cumstances would permit I would even
put on 'Lohengrin' in English in New
York. But circumstances won't permit.
It's all right in theory, but it's not all
right in practice. When you come to sift
the objections to it you get down finally
to just one and that is that the artists,
as a rule, don't wish to sing in English.
Some of them, of course, can't speak Eng
lish, but that doesn't matter so much when
you come to consider that Plancon, for
instance, sings an. entire opera in admir
able German without being able to speak
a single word of that language. No It
Isn't the difficulty of acquiring English,
but it seems to be an objection to the
language itself. I dare say that If we
were to ask Mme. Nordlca, an American,
born ln Maine, to sing grand opera in
English she would object. So, doubtless
would Mme. Eames and all the other
singers whose native tongue Is English.
"It doesn't appear to be so much that
English Is hard to sing as It Is that It is
considered beneath an artist's dignity to
sing grand opera in English. They seem
to reel that It would be somehow a degra
dation." . .. - r â < .r
"But why on earth should it be a degra
dation to sing in English?"
"I suppose it must be because, unhap
pily, English Is not the native language
of grand opera. Englishmen and Ameri
cans don't write grand opera. As soon as
the English speaking race begins to pro
duce successful grand opera then the
stigma on the language in the minds of
singers will begin to disappear.
"At one time I suggested that "The Bo
hemian Girl' be put on in English. The
artists didn't object to the idea violently,
but when Jean de Reszke mentioned the
matter to the late Sir Augustus Harris
that man told Jean that if he heard him
sing 'The Bohemian Girl' in English he
would never speak to him again.
"But aren't you bound by tradition to
the old operas? If even so promising a
composer as E. A. MacDowell or any
other American were to offer you a good
grand opera would you produce it?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 16, 1899.
This Congress thought It settled a great
national question, but It only left a her
itage of war to come over ten years
later.
"Upon the Introduction of the bills for
the organization of the territory acquired
by the treaty with Mexico the slavery
question at once sprang up," Mr. Brad
bury said to me. "The extreme Northern
men insisted on the insertion of the AVil
mot proviso, prohibiting slavery in the
bills covering all the Territories. This
was resisted. by the Southern members.
They urged that the Territories were the
common property of the whole country,
and that they had the same right to them
as the North, and that this was an unfair
attempt to exclude them.
"The discussion went on for months ln
the Senate and House, and the excitement
"Produce lt? Of course we'd produce
lt If it were so good that we felt confi
dence ln It. Aren't we even now bringing
out an opera that Is practically now, De
Lara's 'Messaline?' And, by the way, If
lt goes, we shall bring it out in America
with Calve in the principal part, which
Mr. de Lara has agreed to rewrite for
her, as it originally was arranged for
mezzo-soprano. We may bring out Jules
Massenet's 'Herodlade,' too, which can't
be sung here on account of the Biblical
subject. An American composer, whose
name you know well, asked me If I would
put on a one-act grand opera If he wrote
one for Calve. I told him of course I
would if it were a good one. But he never
came around with It.
"But there haven't been five sucessful
grand operas brought out in the last thir
ty years â really no great successes since
'Carmen.' However, It Isn't operas that
the public goes to hear, it Is the artists.
Put on 'Faust' with an Inconspicuous cast
and you get a small house. Put on a
fioor opera â name no names â a brll
lant cast, and the house is crowded. And
lt Is the most useful opera manager who
knows what tbe public wants and gives it
to them, for the public Itself Is the best
manager, of all, and the man who sets
himself up to give lt something that lt
doesn't want on the ground that lt ought
to want lt Is foolish.
"Yet If I had to-day the ambition that
I had twenty years ago I might try to put
on grand opera in English ln spite of the
prejudice against it, for -I * have - such
continued to Increase. It extended
throughout the country. The Southern
people got very much aroused. The North
ern extremists in Congress insisted that
they would have the proviso. The South
ern extremists then threatened to secede
if slavery was to be excluded from all the
Territories. Conservative members of
both parties, the Democrats and the Na
tionals, united in an effort to bring about
a settlement. Cass and Douglas and
Webster and Clay were our leading men,
Webster and Clay acting with the con
servative Democrats.
"Mr. Clay, who had retired to private
life after he was defeated by Polk for tho
Presidency, returned to the Senate in De

such powerful supporters of grand opera
as England and America should not have
it in their own language. It has been tried
of course without startling success, but
times change, and I firmly believe that
we are coming around to it."
It was Mr. Grau's opinion that If the
English Government were going to spend
money for the establishment of opera by
English composers only, sung by English
artists only, they were foredoomed to
failure, because English composers were'
not writing the sort of grand opera that
the public seemed especially anxious to
hear, and most of the prima donnas now

Mr. Grau is phenomenally busy, as any

of the North and South voted together
against any compromise. Both insisted
they were right. In the Senate, as well
as throughout the country, the excite
ment had become Intense.
"Then, on motion of Mr. Clay, a com
mittee was appointed that reported a se
ries of bills kncwn as Clay's compromise.
The measures embraced by the compro
mise are generally understood. They In
cluded the admission of California as a
free State and the organization of Terri
tories without the proviso, leaving that
question to the people thereof. During
the debate- we had the spectacle day
after day of Webster and Davis voting
together.

to believe that they meant what they
said Mr. Webster was constantly acting
with the conservatives, and Mr. Clay
sometimes met with us also.
"The Northern extremists scouted the
Idea of danger. They said the talk about
withdrawing from the Union was mere
bluster, and that there was no danger of
any such attempt.
"I had occasion to see Webster fre
quently and to know his views and feel
ings; and I have ever regarded his sup
port of the compromise and his speech of
March 7 as among the most patriotic acts
of his life. It was his Intense love of the
Union that guided his course. He was
sensitive to anything that threatened It.
"The danger was more serious than was
believed at the North, and from what
Webster knew he felt It. He and the con
servatives all believed If this crisis was
passed the Union could never again be
exposed to so great peril, as the increase
of population ln the North was so much
greater than ln the South that any future
attempt would invariably fall,

and other Southern Senators filed their
written protests against it as a surrender
of everything of value to the North.
"When Webster returned to Boston the
abolitionists . undertook to exclude him
from Faneuil Hall for surrendering every
thing to the South. He said, however,
that the laws of nature would prevent
slavery going Into any of the Territories
and that the proviso was unnecessary.
The outcome proved It to be true.
"Subsequent events also proved that we
were right ln believing that there was
danger of an attempt to secede. Ten years
afterward the attempt was made, but un
der very different circumstances. In ISSO
the South had a pretext so plausible that
they were united. In 1860 they had no
such pretext and were not united, Mary
land. Kentucky and Missouri adhering to
the Union.
"During that ten years railroads had
spread throughout the great Northwest
and more than doubled its population and
military power. And so great was the di
vision ln the South that Southern cities
had almost as many soldiers in the Union
army as all of New England. Yet lt re
quired an army so large that after more
than thirty years there are nearly a mill
ion pensioners, and it took four years of
war to overcome the attempt to secede.
"These facts will give us the measure of
the danger If the attempt had been made
In 1850, and vindicate the wisdom of avert
ing It by an honorable compromise.
"I have always believed the Union was
ln more danger at that time than lt was
in the darkest days of the civil war. It
was the only time after the commence
ment of the sectional struggle when the
South was relatively strong enough to
have a chance of success.
"I belonged to a different political asso
ciation from Webster and Clay. I saw
much of them during this time of danger
to the Union, and I revered them as noble
patriots."
Senator Bradbury, in spite of advanced
years, preserves his faculties to a remark
able degree. He speaks and writes clearly
and forcibly, although he easily become*
fatigued.
"Clay," he said, "had wonderful tact. 1
remember this Incident In the Senate.
Soule, a Senator from Louisiana, was a
man of great eloquence. He made a
speech attacking Clay's compromise meas
ures, and it made a profound impression.
It aroused Clay, who arose and said a
few words in reply which showed his tact
and skill. After complimenting the dls-
tlnqulshed orator for his eloquence, ha
said:
" 'The gentleman has faithfully de
scribed the agitated condition of the coun
try. What Is the business of a statesman
in such a condition? To provide a rem
edy. Where is his remedy? What does he
propose? Nothing, absolutely nothing, ln
his two hours' speech. The statesman
should have his remedy. It Is email busi
ness to criticize.'
"The effect of Soule's speech was com
pletely overcome in Clay's five-minute re
ply."
When asked about Calhoun, Senator
Bradbury said: "He was a man of very
great ability, was honest and sincere, but
was mastered by his theories. Calhoun
was very fond of converting young men
to his theories of government. ' I had a
long conversation with him prior to the
revival of the slavery question. I recol
lect he made a remark that If his theory
of government had been adopted the
Union would last forever.
"He then explained his theory. It waa
that the national Government should do
absolutely nothing except what was nec
essary to preserve Its nationality. He
believed the national Government should
have to do with matters of peace and war,
leaving all internal matters to each Indi
vidual State. The nation would serve as
a great protector, and as such would be
honored by all the States. There would
then be no need of much national reve
nue, or a great number of federal office
holders.
"Calhoun, referring to the patronage
system, told me that he feared the time
would come when the adherents of polit
ical parties would vote rather for the ad
vantages to be secured out of federal
offices than for the principles represented
by the parties."
Maine people, regardless of political
faith, honor and revere former Senator
Bradbury as "the grand old man" of hie
State. His age makes him like the "last
leaf on the tree," and his achievements
as the contemporary of a group of great
men of which he is the sole survivor make
him a living historical reminder of the
growth and greatness of this American
nation.
Mr. Bradbury In his college days was a
classmate of Longfellow at Bowdoin. He
remembers the early history of the United
States, and has been a close observer of
the progress and development of the na
tion, besides having had a prominent and
active part in its history.

Evidently in the eyes of this particu

milliner is below that of the female

I did not care to strain my over
worked imagination to the needful
notch for conjuring up a picture of this
erstwhile society belle, for the nonce a
milliner. So I nought her ln the square

to have him broken. This was easy, so I made arrangements with a
trainer to break him, charge only $25, and in due time he was returned
to me with a guarantee of being thoroughly broken, and so gentle that
a lady could drive him.
Sunday came, and I thought it would be a nice thing to take a
drive behind my colt, sol had the livery man hitch him, to a buggy
and I took hold of the reins. Possibly the colt had forgotten me. He
turned his head to the right and then to the left to get a good look at
me, undoubtedly for the purpose of ascertaining whether he had ever
met me before or not. Suddenly, having evidently made up his mind
that he knew me; he started. He may have been enthusiastic. upon
the subject of having me as a driver; he may have thought it- was a
holiday; because when he started. instead of advancing with his
forelegs, he threw his hind ones over the dash in close proximity to

Well, he only started, because when he reached the middle of the

he was a trotter, but by his conduct I began to think him a runner.
He covered more territory within a short time than any "bang tail" I
ever saw on the track. We finally stoppedâ that Is, the buggy and I,

for. I had tried the thousand things
for which I had no ability. There was
just one thing for which I had any real
talent trimming hats. For : three
months I spent my mornings at the best
milliners in town learning the tricks of
the trade.
"Then I burned my bridges, borrowed
some money, Imported some hats, hired
a competent trimmer, and sent cards
to every one I ever knew. It's between
seasons now, you know, so I can't ex
pect to do very much. But I'm more
than making expenses, and they're
awfully heavy. Isn't that stunning?"

On the way to San 'Rafael I wonder

The matter was discussed at the stable, and all declared my colt a
record breaker, and that all that was necessary was to have him han
dled and gaited on the track. A well-known trainer volunteered with
the remark. "It won't cost much, and I want to help you out." Of
course I seized the opportunity at once and delivered the colt to my
newly acquainted friend.
In a couple of days one of our mills sent me a bill for $3S for
cracked harley and oats, and a few days afterward a hay firm sent me
a bill for $42 for hay and straw. I inquired if this was all right, and
was told It was the proper thing in order to develop my colt.
In about ten days my trainer called upon me, stated that the colt
had good "motion" and was apt to show considerable speed. He In
formed me that while he did not want any money, yet one of his chil
dren was sick, and his wife needed $10; of course this was a little mat
ter of friendship, so I gave it to him. I did not see him for a week,
then he came in one day and informed me that he had no desire to put
me to any expense, consequently had borrowed Bill Brown's harness,
but Bill needed it. He knew where there was a $90 harness for $50, and
while he did not Insist upon my getting it. he thought it would be a
nice thingâ the colt would get used to it and could make better time.
Well, I considered anything* necessary for the welfare of the colt
paramount to any of my desires, so I bought the harness.
Soon afterward I was informed that the colt was showing some
"fine quarters" and that Tim McGraw had been kind enough to allow
us to use his sulky, but It was an old-fashioned concern and there
fore did not . give the colt a fair show. There was a "bike" which
could be bought for $110, "dirt cheap," and it would greatly assist the
colt in making better time. Of course I bought the bike.
The Agricultural Society announced a race for "District horses,"
and my trainer told me that we had a "walkover." The entrance was
only $25, with $20 and $15 additional. He thought it a wise thing to
enter the colt. Naturally I was pleased, so, of course, the colt was
entered.
About this time I became anxious to see the colt go, so Inquired
when I should better come out, and was told "almost any day." Being
busy, I neglected going until after I paid the second Installment on
the entrance money. I was told to come out on Thursday morning at
T o'clock sharp. I was there, and found my trainer sitting on the
fence. I Inquired for the colt, and he took me around the corner, in
forming me that the colt was ln the barn. He said, "Now the thing
is Just like this: these fellows have got on to the speed of -the colt.
I was going to take him out about 7 o'clock and Jog him a bit, so they
took out their watches, and I thought I would fool them; I went out
this morning at daylight, and 'sent him a half.' and of course I would
not like to give him any more work to-day. If you will come out Sun
day morning about daylight I will show you what he can do."
This was a seemingly square statement, and there was no reason
why I should dispute it, so I went back to my office thrilled with the
prospect of the speed that I would see developed on Sunday morning.
Saturday afternoon my trainer visited me and Inquired. "Are you
coming out ln the morning?" to which I assented. He then said:
"Well, all right, only the colt has been off his feed for the last day or
two, and I think he will get back about Tuesday, so better postpone
your visit until Wednesday morning."
Of course this man knew all about horses and I began to think
that I did not, so I consented.
On Monday afternoon I made the last payment on the race, and
on Tuesday afternoon my trainer Informed me that the colt "had
pulled up a trifle lame," but he thought that everything would be all
right within a couple of days, and suggested that I come out on the
following Friday. He would then be In such perfect condition that he
would give him a full mile. 7.T"
' â _ I was warned that I must be there by 4 o'clock a. m. in order to
prevent any of the stable boys from seeing his wonderful burst of
speed; so, for the purpose of being on time, I sat up all night and went
out to the track In order to faithfully keep my appointment at 4
o'clock. I found my trainer ln bed â so was the colt.
It seems that the colt "must have picked up a nail" or something
else, and as my trainer was a particular friend of mine and was
working for my best interests, he said he would talk to me candidly,
which I guess he did. for he told me this:
"Now. see here, old man, you have got a world beater, and there
is no mistake about that, but he has gone wrong this season, through
no fault of mine. This often happens with. a speedy colt such as he,
especially where they have that high-strung disposition.
"Now, what I would advise you to do is this: I would turn him out
on pasture until next season. Of course, we have paid the entrance
money, and If you want me to drive him, why I will do It, and I may
get third money, but lam afraid it Is going to hurt the colt. Next
year you can put him In the three-minute class, and he will walk
away with all of the money."
Now, what could I say to a friend who was doing so much for me,
and especially when he knew all about horses? Of course I rave Â»â Â«!
ered in a little knot on the veranda.
I was taken into the circle and told to
enjoy my share of the mosquitoes.
We finally evoluted from the weath
er to the "earning-your-own-living"
problem. A ten-cent girl with a ten
thousand dollar education thought it
would be "great sport."
"I don't believe." said Marie, "that
we could all of us together earn
enough to buy a golf stick. If I had
to support myself. I'd put In two or
[ three years visiting all the people who
'have Invited me and then "
And then?
"Why, then oh, bother, what's
the use of thinking, it's silly!"
"The thing to do when you see pov
erty coming your way is to get out of

spots. '.:"â¢-' 7-.
- "Yes, but how?" asked the maiden
who makes repartee Impossible.
The howness of the whichness is no
concern of a girl who is clever in
patches.
Then a girl who passes in the set as
"literary" remarked that she would
really like to be forced to have to be
"somebody" and make "something" of
herself.
"Just look at Juliet Wllbor Tompkins
and Kathryn Jarboe," said the girl with
the aspirations. "They've gone Into the
magazine field and they're winners.
Two or three of the other girls have
had the courage to go on to New York
and they're owning their own living."
OTHER THINGS THEY MIGHT DO.
. We called off the "two or three other
girls" by name. Two of them are mu
sicians and the other one is an artist.
They have ail three studied here, thpre
and everywhere. Their families are
heartbroken because they insist on be
ing "bachelor girls" and "earning their
own living."
, Now this is the brutal truth. Grace
has a studio in ore of the most expen
sive downtown buildings in New ' York.
"She** has any number of Interesting
friends who entertain not a liter*, and
The Society Millir_er.
Grace paints the menu cards and at
tends to the decorations. Grace writes
home all the pretty compliments paid
her work and winds up her letter with
"Of course I couldn't take any pay
from dear Mrs. So and So."
And fond mamma says "quite right."
and the cruel outsider wonders wheth
er dear Mrs. So and So "would order
them unless she were perfectly sure
there would be no bill forthcoming.
Grace gives studio teas, the crush
comes and some one remarks, "I must
have one of your pictures for my col
lection." Then Grace writes home
again and says "she will be very busy
filling an order." And the prospective
purchaser always remains just far
enough ahead to keep up the delusion
in her own and her family's mind, that
she is "earning her own living."
A girl can afford to pay the penalty
of ambition, providing pa pays the
bills!
The two musicians likewise have
"studios," which is the name applied
nowadays to back apartments with
gas stoves. But Edith and Jane, who
used to write her name Janette before
she became a bachelor girl, have the
real thing.
Their apartments are hung with
tapestries, decorated, with works of art.
rare china and priceless bronzes.
Edith sings and Jane plays the piano.
They have studied with all the teach
ers from Marches! to Moskowski. They
have adjoining apartments and prac
tice together. Their friends say they
are so obliging, always willing to come
and sing or play at teas or "at homes."
After these little affairs, over their
steaming chafing dishes, Edith and
Jane count up how much they could
make if they only charged for their
services. They really believe that their
hostesses would pay them If they per
mitted it.
Edith wrestles with one pupil and
Jane cultivates paresis with two. So

to his superior wisdom, and the colt was turned out on pasture.
I did not see my trainer for ten days, when he suddenly appeared
on an occasion when I was very busy. He thought we ought to have
a settlement. "A settlement of what?" I inquired. He replied. "I
have worked this colt for about five months, and $30 a month isn't a
marker for ray services. Of course you have given me a little money
from time to time for the children, but I more than paid that out to
stable boys. I have a little statement here which you can look over
and see if it is all right." Whereupon he produced his bill of the black
smith for shoeing, amounting to $16, together with the bill of the har
nessmaker for halters, boots, hoods, etc., amounting to $7S, which he
said would have to be paid at once, as the parties were crowding him
for the money. I was not "astonished;" this was too mild a term to
express my feelings l settled with him.
I resolved, however, to have my horse run down in the pools on
the three-minute race for the coming year, so I would make a "kill
ing" and get even on my past expenses.
I waited patiently for the coming season and in due time sent out
for my colt. The colt was not in the pasture â "he must have gotten
mixed up with some other horses, but they would send him in to me
soon." _Â£____Â§
I think I paid $100 trying to find that colt, but I didn't find him.
I was consoled, however, ; by some of my friends, who told me,
"Tou are not a sucker. You ought to thank your stars that you
played so lucky," and when I inquired, "How was I lucky?" I was told
"Because you didn't have a 'stable" Instead of one horse.-*

ments, go to the opera and concerts,
â¢take in the horse show and wear silk
lined gowns. As I said before they
have three pupils, and one a charity
pupil at that.
But it's easily explained. Pa's rich
and Mi don't care. So Edith and Jane
go on "earning their own rivl.-.s-.**
Going down to the train with me one
of, the girls --aid: "Well, a society girl's
about as much use earning her own liv
ing as a caddy is on the' links. They
think they're working, but it's always
some other fellow."
* â¢ â¢
I met one of the "other fellows" on
the boat going home. His only daugh
ter is in New York trying to be "some
body" and do "something." He sends
her an allowance and a large one every
month. It isn't a trial, for he has a
goodly store to draw from.
But he wants her companionship; he
misses the delightful camaraderie of his
walks and drives. He likes to talk over
his favorite books with her. However,
she's a bachelor girl in New York "earn
ing her own living."
And she could be somebody right
here at home, and she could do "some
thing." That is If she were willing to
do the work and the only work for
which she Is fittedâ take her mother's
place in her father's household.
"It seems to me," said the old gen
tleman as we boarded the car, "that
the fault lies in the way we educate
our girls. If she really had to take care
of herself, I don't believe she could, yet
I've spent thousands on her education."
It seems to me, I said, thinking lt
over, that she could take care of her
self if she were willing to be honest.
For the fault lies not only in the edu
cation. It's all well enough to learn
about artists and authors, painters and
musicians, but the Lord meant some of
us for stenographers and seamstresses.
And we can enjoy the work of others,
though our own be of a different na
ture.
And the society girl who is writing
"milliner" after the name that has been
written scores of times In the list of
fashionables at an affair has simply
been honest with herself about her own
capabilities.
There isn't any use hunting for a
royal road for breadwinners. The mil
liner who was a society girl says take
the path for which you have the most
ability, even If it doesn't be ln the
world of art.
And by the covers of the Blue Book,
I think she Is right.

TO MEET THE QUEEN
HOW OUR AMERICAN
GIRLS ARE PRESENTED
*y*< MONG the many social functions
f I in London the one of special ln
âl terest, to the feminine visitor, at
>â¢ I least. is the Queen's drawing
â¢** room, and judging from the
ever-increasing number of Americans
presented at court on these occasions
the approach of spring must be a sig
nal for almost as much of a flutter on
our side of the Atlantic as that which
disturbs the peace of the English fire
side. It creates a stir throughout the
country, compared to which that al
most national event in England, the
spring cleaning, fades Into insignifi
cance. While from a social point of
view the drawing-rooms are great
events, the chief benefit derived from
them Is the Impetus they give to the
trades of the dressmakers, the florists,
caterers and photographers, and the
Queen is largely Influenced by this con
sideration in the number she holds dur
ing the season.
Not content with tremblingly enter
ing the presence of the sovereign once,
a great many English women go
through the ceremony a number of
times, being re-presented "on their
marriage," "on their husband's promo
tion," etc. From 10 in the morning un
til evening on a drawing-room day one
meets carriages containing white
gowned and plumed women rolling to
and from Buckingham Palace. Every
house from which some one is going to
be presented is marked by a carpet ex
tending from the front door to the car
riage, each side of which is lined with
open eyed and mouthed people
waiting to see madame sail forth in all
the glory of her presentation gown.
There are numbers of country people
who come to London just to get a
glimpse of all the fuss and feathers and
who, while the carriages wait in line,
sometimes for hours, before reaching
the palace, pass from carriage to car
riage, peering in at the proud and
happy occupants, who regard this as
part of the performance. Even when
the palace door is at last reached there
another wait follows in the ante-room,
but there at least one can admire or
pick to pieces the gowns of the other
women and exchange confidences about
the conditions of one's nerves with
one's friends. The most difficult thine
In connection with the presentation is
the management of the court train, and
even after the drilling which every one
goes through before the eventful day
one must feel some misgivings at the
last moment.
One is inclined to ask if the time,
worry and expense which a presenta
tion entails are worth the very few
moments of the actual ceremony. One
Is announced, enters, bows to the
Queen and other royalties, advances to
kiss the Queen's hand, and backs out.
It is generally conceded that those few
moments are very trying ones, and
many amusing stories are told, though
of course the most amusing ones are
attributed to Americans. One is to the
effect that an American of great fresh
ness and beauty made so pleasing an
Impression on the Queen that her Maj
esty impulsively leaned forward and
kissed her. Our compatriot, either from
surprise or ignorance of court etiquette,
returned the salute with great gusto!
Another American girl in an agony of
nervousness, seeing the Queen's hand
extended. Instead of kissing it shook it
and murmured confusedly, "How do
you do?"
Probably the greatest charm of the
f.resentation lies in the fuss made over
tby the debutante's friends. It is
talked of weeks before and weeks after,
and the day itself is one of long and
delirious excitement. Immediately
after leaving the palace every one
drives to the photographer's to immor
talize the gown. It is difficult to im
agine how- the photographers get
through such a day. for not only have
they so many appointments, but they
ere all for nearly the same hour. Near
ly every woman who is presented issues
Invitations for what is known as a
"drawing-room tea," and immediately
after her return from the studio and a
short turn in the park she stands for a
couple of hours while her friends flock
in to admire her gown, talk over the
presentation and congratulate her. If
at no other time in her life she is queen
of the assemblage, she Is this once, and
she enjoys it as fully as only her femi
nine nature is capable of doing.
How differently the men take their
presentation to the Prince of Wales
when he holds a levee. They drive un
concernedly through town in hansoms,
their brilliant uniforms or court dress
standing out against the dark back

ground of the cabs. At 2 o'clock the
whole thing Is over, and except for the
flash of a helmet or the glitter of gold
braid from a passing cab London
would not know that a levee was being
held.
The Queen, even when she holds a
drawing-room in person, which is rare
ly more than twice during the season,
does not remain for all the presenta
tions, as her advancing years make the
fatigue too great for her to, bear. She
may receive half of the list, |>ut usually
leaves the palace about half-past 4 for
a drive in Hyde Park. This Is one of
the few occasions which the Londoners
have for demonstrating their loyalty,
for the Queen dislikes London Intensely
and spends as little time there as pos
sible. Hyde Park corner and the park
are crowded with people on this after
noon, who are eager to catch a
glimpse of her Majesty, and, while her
reception is an enthusiastic one for the
English to give, It must appear cold to
those who are accustomed to the dem
onstrations some of the popular Conti
nental severeigns receive. This being
the year of the Queen's eightieth birth
day, the number of applicants to the
Lord Chamberlain for presentation has

Against Cheap BooKs.
Sir Walter Besant Is not fond of cheap
price books. As he writes books to sell
he realizes what it means to the pocket
book. Says he: "I think that it is high
time, in the Interest of everybody con
nected with literature, to protest against
the issue of the sixpenny book. It floods
the London bookstall; it covers the coun
ters; it makes books eta higher price un
salable. No one will think of paying more
than sixpence (12 cents) for a book if he
can get a readable one for that sum. It
is fast leading people to believe that six
pence is the outside price that ought -to
be paidâ unless it is 9 centsâ a book
on any subject. I find it stated in one
paper that a new tic-id of readers has been
opened up by the sixpenny book. I wish
I could think so.
"For my own part I do not want to see
literature too cheap. 1 want free libra
ries everywhere, which shall encourage
and enlarge the habit of reading and edu
cate the people in good taste. A public
library ought never to keep. lend, or buy
rubbish. I like to think that literature is
loved so much that people, to obtain it
and possess it, will consent to some thrift,
some kind of self-sacrifice. We all re
member the mischievous effect in America
of the pirated cheap literature; how it
nearly ruined the literary profession, and
how it destroyed the people's respect for
literature by giving them the finest works
of genius in vile paper, vile printing and
vile covers. If fine work is to be pro
duced the artistâ whether poet, dramatist,
novelist or essayistâ must be able to live
by his work; to be able to work all day
long if necessary without having to earn
his livelihood first.
"How can a manâ how can a bookseller
âhow can a publisherâ live by sixpenny
books? Granted that he may get through
100,000 copies. What does it mean to the
author? About $1250 to the good. But
more than half these copies are bought In
stead of higher-priced books. This pro
portion is only approximate, but It serves
to indicate the broad fact. If my conten
tion Is wrong; If the sixpenny books arÂ©
bought in addition to instead of in place
of books of a higher price, then I with
draw my objection. But this I cannot be
lieve in the face of all that I am told and
all that I observe. If I remember aright,
this attempt to enlarge the field of read
ers by cheap Issues has been made two
or three times already, and has resulted
over and over again in the discovery that
the field is not enlarged but that those
who buy give sixpence instead of the
former high price. The only way, I re
peat, is to enlarge the field gradually by
means of free libraries and education; to
make literature accessible to all; and to
trust that the desire to possess will cause
readers to save up their money in order
to buy."

It Is often asked whether colored cov
ers really help to sell books or not. And
it is not at all an easy question to answer.
Publishers hem and haw over lt, and
salesmen in bookshops say they are not
sure. But we have some evidence from
England that bears on the subject,
though lt does not determine it. Mrs.

not take her "Jackanapes" In plain cov
ers; they would not even try to sell it.

ahead from a point a distance away it
corkscrews within a small' space, being
elevated on pillars that increase in height
as the bridge rises until the level of the
span is reached. Passengers on foot and
travelers in vehicles wind around a spiral
roadway, first going toward the river, and
then turning their backs to lt, and then
facing around toward it again, until at
last they find themselves on the bridge

NEW YORK GONE
TUNNEL MAD.
IF New York City Is not tunnel mad
her citizens have certainly developed
something that is closely allied to a
mania for underground transit. Years
ago the first tunnel scheme was pro
jectedâ fio many years ago that the oldest
Inhabitants would have difficulty in re
membering the dateâ and since that time
there have been dozens of such projects
launched upon the financial world. Some
of them have existed only upon paper,
while others have progressed to a most
uninteresting condition of incompletion,
but in each case the interest that has been
aroused in the proposed Improvement has
been permitted to languish and die, and for
a score or more of years the citizens of
New York have thought less of the tunnel
sohemes than of the possibility of some
time being able to reach Europe by means
of aerial navigation. **; \- . . â¢ .';â¢'â â 
Suddenly, however, there has come a
change in the public pulse, and now noth
ing but tunnels and underground transit
Is being talked of.
During the few weeks that have elapsed
since the revival of these long buried
projects nearly a score of plans have been
drawn, and all have tended to the same
end. If these are all carried out, the citi
zen of New York who rides above ground
VI II be regarded somewhat In the light
of a relic of old conditions who is too slow
to keep up with the times.
Up to the present time the tunnel
schemes of New York have been chiefly
conspicuous for the ease with which they
have consumed the capital of those who
have Interested themselves in them. The
old Hudson River tunnel is without
doubt the costliest hole in the ground
in the world. At the present time lt is a
long, deep excavation, filled almost to
the top with water. To the eye of the
casual observer who was not up ln tun
AN ART GEM IN ONE OF OUR CEMETERIES.
THERE Is an art gem tucked away
in a corner of the section set
apart for children, in one of our
largest cemeteries. It is not an
elaborate vault of elegantly
carved marble, nor a delicately fas
hioned shaft, nor yet an idealized fig
ure of perfect workmanship; but mere
ly a simple slab and lying "upon it are
two little children wrapped in each
other's arms. Yet the hand of true art
is there, for the divine spark of life
has been breathed into the group. The
pose is so natural that they seem to
be but resting as ln life when
watched by those to whom they
were so dear in peaceful sleep. It
brings the lump in the throat and
touches the heart strings, and that af
ter all, Is the true sign of an artistio
success.
They represent little twins of sh_
years of age who died in ISB3, and there
is no inscription to tell who the two
little ones were; only the cemetery's
mortuary record shows that. Their
forms were thus reproduced only for
those who mourned their early death.
In spite of the ravages of time on the
rough plaster in which they were casi,
the figures still display the original
grace of pose and molding.
Sixteen years of exposure to wind
and rain, to heat and cold, have crack
ed and worn the monument until now.,

tiques of Greek or Roman art. It Is to
nel lore It does not look as If it was
worth the trouble of pumping lt out
and yet this is all that Is left to show
for more than $4,000,000, and the loss of
twenty-one lives.
It was early In the seventies that Colo
nel de Witt Clinton Hasklns conceived the
scheme of constructing a tunnel under
the Hudson River. He had made money
ln the Union Pacific Railroad and his rep
utation as an engineer enabled him to in
terest such men as Senator Jones of Ne
vada and Millionaire Park in his project.
Together they subscribed $2,000,000 to
carry out the plans and when the money
had been spent they stopped work. Dur
ing this period, however, the tunnel
sprung a leak and twenty-one men were
drowned like rats ln a trap. At the time
when the work on the tunnel was brought
to a standstill the hole was not half com
pleted.

IN THE BOOK WORLD
"MEN'S TRAGEDIES," BOOK
EOR WINTER READING
fy DMMER is a pacific season in the
\^y hook world, and material for re
*+) view comes slowly. This lndul-
r m *y gence to the temperature on the
* part of publishers turns our
thoughts back upon a book that has
been some weeks available and yet Is
not with us either by invitation
or suffrance. I speak of R. V. Risley's
"Men's Tragedies." As I write no
bookshop of prominence has the work
for sale, and none seem anxious to ob
tain it. Now, why is this? Trash ga
lore grins at us from the book shelves,
yawns at us from the tables, and yet
a work that proves its author, a very
young man, too, to be possessed of po
tential greatness, glides unnoticed into
gloom. Gloom, perhaps that is it. It
is summer and we would laugh. The
tragedy of bread-winning Is enough.
We will choose our summer literary
diet of lighter stuff , and we will have
it spread where green hills are the
outlook and the wind stirs the trees
to let the sunlight through. The book
has a preface, and a remarkable one.
To some it would be a warning to keep
out; to others an invitation to enter.
After having read the tragedies one
might slightly change the words of
Jacques ln "As You Like It" and make
a preface equally explanatory. "It is
a melancholy of mine own. compound
ed of many complexes, extracted from
nine morbid objects, and indeed the
sundry contemplation of my travels, in
which my often rumination wraps me
in a most Inharmonious sadness." All
reviewers, I take it, are armed with full
permission to speak their minds, and
there are generally as many reasons
why one should condemn a book as
praise lt. If we so desire we can find
in Risley's nine fictional essays every
manner of doubt as to future great
ness or present originality. He is re
miniscent of Goethe, in that his field
of study Is nature and the human af
fections; of Schiller, when he touches
upon the human aspirations. In a con
fused sort of a way he even suggests
Crawford. -There is a passage some
where that warns us against becom
ing human buzzards, who fly over
God's great, green, beautiful earth
looking for carrion and missing more
sights than they see. 5 "Men's Trage
dies" recalls it. It would be impossible
to traverse the experience of acquaint
ance with these nine men, live over
their tragedies and come out of their
society just as we were when we en
tered it. And yet one should read the
book. It would be well, perhaps, if Mr.
Rlsley chose for his summer wander
ings a quiet spot where he could
"gather bluebells and acorn-cups and
find his way to happiness." He might
then come back to us with a wider
literary horizon ready to "take hold of
a big world with many hands." But,
in the meantime, are we to sit back
and demand always as an antecedent
condition that a man shall be famous
before we read his books? If bo. we
will crush the life out of every rising
author and build our literature but
slowly. He is not yet "in partnership
with things that help the world on,"
but, nevertheless, he merits our con
sideration. He strikes no introductory
chords in his stories, but plunges ot
once to the business in hand, somewhat
clumsily at times, but giving us the
picture without varnish. Only in the
first essay does he follow the beaten
track of a scenery introduction, and
this puts us in touch with the charac
ter of the landscape that is to affect
the human character of those who
come within its influence. In this es
say he makes a character say,. "I sink
further and further into the gloom of
my mood," and the metaphor is the key
to the morbidness that follows. But
a powerful hand is at work, and if we
read between the lines we will see its
: power.
In "The Man Who Hated" we read:
"There was no peace in this book-bred
mind, used to the long distances of his
tory and philosophy, and a deep ex
asperation against littleness made him
willful and impatient at the every
day s. He was weary that he had no
rears and had not yet awakened to
great hopes." Mr. Risley's seems a
book-bred mind, but 'tis well equipped
to meet the world and see what others
have perchance passed by. He tells us
things that we do not understand and
hence do not like, but as one of his
women has ; said "Perhaps we will by
and by when we remember them and
don't laugh at them any more." He
uses some very ugly English and queer
verbal contortions, but many a well
turned phrase as well. He speaks of
"the bravery of a well-slept night,"
tells us "the pity of autumn was in the
air " that "Paris Is afraid she is in the
The Grave of thÂ« Little Twins.
be regretted that the material in which
they were cast is not of a more endur-
this country available for such a scheme
an effort was made to Interest English
capital and it succeeded admirably. Sir
Benjamin Baker, Sir John Fowler and
others of the nobility of the old world
thought they saw an excellent opportuni
ty to take adavantage of the money that
had already been expended and they sent
$2,000,000 more. That, too, went into the
hole. Again the funds gave out and in
1892 the tunnel was walled up and left to
Itself. Now lt has been sold once more
and this time, it is said, the work will
be completed.
The prospects for the completion of the
other tunnel schemes are almost equally
as bright, for when such men as Roths
child, Rockefeller, Whitney, Wldener, El
kins, Flower and Brady figure in a syn
dicate formed for a specific purpose he
would be a rash prophet who would dare
to predict the failure of the project. For
some time past these men, whose names
dark," that some one "was constantly
running against sharp truths and hurt
ing his ideals," that "lower natures
take disillusion more easily because
they have not so far to fall." When
he would explain why a certain farmer
lived in a ravine instead of on the hills
of his ancestors, he does so by saying:
"As the energy of the race lowered
they had come down the hill." In one
short paragraph he has written the
spiritual biography of many a human
soul. "There is something in a man's
heart that makes him, when his own
beloved belief has fallen, feel that all
other beliefs are his. He damns all
dreams in the bitterness of his dis
appointment." He shows in the follow
ing description a keen sense of the
ridiculous and a steady pen for char
acter drawing: "He was a tall, slim,
fair man, with a low forehead, a mili
tary carriage, a large mustache and
plastered down yellow hair. He wore
an eyeglass, stuck out his chin, talked
in a bark, and clanked his saber and
stared coldly. He would have chucked
a saint under the chin â if she were
pretty used his old love letters to light
his pipe with and faced a charging
regiment without losing his glass out
of his eye." From the standpoint of
critical literary examination Mr. Rls
ley's style Is bad and his tales a little
monotonous. His characters are all
idealists who become Peter Grievances
and build or rather wreck their lives
upon the foundation of a shock. But he
has a future. We can't put next year's
peaches on the table and thoroughly
enjoy their flavor, but we can encour
age their growth and not blight them
by frost and neglect. Mr. Risley's book
is quite unlike the fiction with which
we are surfeited and let us welcome
him and his efforts cordially and hope
fully. CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.

SAN FRANCISCO HAS LARGEST
KANGAROO EVER CAPTURED
Tin-: largest kangaroo ever brought
to America is now in -San Fran
cisco. He Is a member of the blue
haired family and Is known among
Australians as the "Old Man" spe
cies, and was captured .it;-- six
weeks ago in Paramatta. Australia, by
James ''adogan. who brought him over
on the Mariposa.
"Old Mail." as he has been dubbed by
Frank Kent, superintendent of the Chutes
iZoo. is exceedingly well behaved, and no
doubt will prove the central attraction of
the animal show, as Kent intends to make
a boxer out of him. Though "Old Man"
has not yet mastered the fine points of
the game, being a novice in the art. Kent
expects in a few weeks to have him de
veloped into a full-fledged heavy-weight,
and intends to issue a challenge to Jef
fries or Sharkey to determine the relative
power of brute strength to the physical
force of manhood. "Old Man" has all the
necessary qualifications for a fighter. He
has an enormous reach, weighs 200 pounds
and when standing erect on his hind toes
measures seven feet to the tips of his fore
limbs. Kent went into the cage yesterday*
and boxed a few rounds with him.
"Old Mai demonstrated that he was
Clever at "parrying" and "ducking." and
he has one trick which is destined to win
for him the championship of the world.
When you least expect it he lets both of
his hind legs fly forward, and woe to the
man who receive:-; the full force of the

while ; i *" was explaining to him that the

the corner of the cage, aitt fortunately
was not hurt. Kent will teach him to box
with the gloves, nnd a most entertaining
a- will soon be on the bills.
"Old Man" feeds on fruit, tables,
hay. grain and almost anything hat a
horse will eat, and he displays a singular
fondness for appl"?. It i:* not thought
that a shoe could be found to fit him, as
his foot measures over a foot in length
and each one is provided with two claws
at least two inches long. His tail Is three
feet long and Is a formidable weapon,
weighing at least thirty pounds. It is
amusing: to see him use the tail as a kind
of springboard to propel him in his jumps.
Mr. Kent, who has had many years of
experience with â â â '.'. kinds of animals, says
that he only knew of one kangaroo which
nearly equaled this one in size, and he
died In Boston some time ago.
The taking of "Old Man's" picture was
an Interesting process yesterday morning.
It was necessary for Mr. Kent to get in
the cage to pose his pet for the photog
rapher, who tremblingly entered the
cage, also. Kent, by means of the ju
dicious bestowal of apples and by playing
with the subject, got him into several at
titudes, but it was found impossible to
induce him to stand at his highest, so the
effect of his gigantic appearance may not
be as well conveyed as it might be. The
flashlight had no appreciable effect on
"Old Man." He gave a little start, just
as a human being would do, but Imme
diately went on sparring with Kent, and

School. Shortly after this T organized
another one in the Western Star Band
of Hope, of which Mrs. James Keene
every once in a while shot out a "double
hind-foot blow," which taxed Kent's
science to evade. This kick is one of his
greatest accomplishments, and he uses it
indiscriminately.
But the greatest of excitement was
created when it was attempted to get a
double picture of "Old Man" and a "wal
laby," which is a smaller sort of kanga
roo. Such a commotion .rose among the
other denizens of the Zoo as must have
awakened the dead. When the "wallaby"
was brought into the cage "Old Man"
made a pass at him. and it was all Kent
could do to -train him from injuring
one of his own kind. The "wallaby" dis
creetly retired to a corner, and could not
be coaxed to me nearer, but finally ran
several tin around the cage, upsetting
the camera in his flight. The noise awak
ened Sultana, the mother of Adgie's lions,
who occupies the adjoining cage, and she
surveyed the situation with calm disdain
and appeared angry at being aroused out
of a sound slumber. The Siberian wolver
ines were interested spectators of the
scene, and the Canada wolf stood on his
hind legs wondering what all the row was
about. The monkey-faced rooster poked
its grotesque head through the wires, and
Don Caesar, the big bear, jumped up out
of the most lazy position imaginable
which he had been occupying, and Nero,
the big lion, observed it all with the dig
nity characteristic of his race. As the
"wallaby" continued to circle around, all
the animals in the Zoo set up a terrific
howling, which was only quelled when
the "wallaby" was taken out and pho
tographed in the open, all by himself. The
attendant throughout the seance carried
the "wallaby" by the tail, which appears
to be one way of carrying an object.
The species to which "Old Man" belongs
Is known in zoological literature as "Ma
cropus Giganteus," in allusion to the pe
culiar length of its hind foot. The head,
especially In the larger species, is small,
compared with the rest of the body, and
tapers forward to the muzzle. The shoul
ders and fore limbs are feebly developed,
and the hind limbs are of disproportionate
strength and magnitude, which gives
them a peculiarly awkward appearance
when moving about on all fours, as they
occasionally do while feeding. Rapid pro
gression is however performed only by
the powerful hind limbs, the animal coy
. ering the ground by a series of immense
bounds, during which the fore par*, of the
body is inclined forward and balanced
by the long, strong, tapering tail, which Is
carried horizontally backward. When
not moving tney often assume a per
fectly upright position, the tail aiding
the two hind legs to form a sort of sup
porting tripod, and the front limbs dang
ling by the side of the chest. This posi
tion gives full scope for the senses of
sight, hearing and smell to warn of the
approach of enemies, from which they
save themselves by their bounding flight,
their astonishing leaps being twenty feet
or more in length.
The kangaroos are naturally timid, inof
fensive creatures, but the larger ones,
when hard pressed, will turn and defend
themselves, sometimes killing a dog by
grasping it In their forepaws, and Inflict
ing terrible wounds with the sharp claws

frequented parts of the country, feeding
together like a herd of deer. When
frightened, the females put their young
ones Into their pouch by means of their
small front feet, or if the young are large
enough they allow them to jump in them
selves, and then away they hasten, leap
ing long distances over rocks and fallen
trees.
It is related that a gentleman, the owner
of sixty thousand sheep, barely escaped
being drowned by an "old man" once.
He enjoyed calling "hilloo" to his kanga
roo dogs, but all the amusement ceased
when an "old man" came leaping toward
him. clutched him around the waist with
his forefeet and commenced hopping
away to a large water hole to drown him
âa well-known and dangerous practice
which the kangaroos haVe in fighting
their enemies. He cried out lustily, as he
might under the circumstances he very
well excused for doing, and luckily the
faithful dogs ' .-'me to his rescue.
The first introduction to the world of
a group of animals now SO familiar was
on the 14th of July. 1770, when Captain
Cook, curing his first memorable voyage
of discovery, was detained for the pur
pose of refitting his ship at Endeavor
River, on the northeast coast of Aus
tralia. It is recorded in the annals of
the voyage that "a strange looking ani
mal entirely unknown to the ship's com
pany was frequently seen. Mr. Gore, who
went out with his sun. had the good for
tune to kill one of the animals which had
been so much the subject of our specu
lation and. which is called by the natives
kangaroo." The name has been adopted
for this animal in all European languages
with only slight modifications of spelling.
Further explorations in Australia have
led to the discovery of a very consid
erable number of species. The affinities
of the species, skins of which were
brought home by Captain Cook and sub
sequent voyagers, were recognized by
Schreoer as nearer to the American opos
sums (then the only known marsupials)
than to any other animals with which
zoologists were acquainted, and conse.
and was entirely the outcome of her
own ideas on the subject cf teaching
children kindness. Miss Ryder's pledge,
formulated by herself, bound the chil
dren taking it not to fight, nor to abuse
animals, nor stone Chinese, and al
though, like all leaders In reform, she
met with opposition at first, later ot:
Miss M. M. Murphy, principal of the
school, became convinced of th good
effects of her work and organized all
the classes into bands, every pupil be
ing required to take this triple pledge.
In February, ISO 3. at the earnest re
quest of S. D. White, principal of
quently It was placed by him in his great
work on the mammalia, then in course
of publication, in the genus "Didelphis"
with "Gigantea" for a specific designa
tionâthe latter having been bestowed b;.
Ximmermann under the impression that
it was huge species of jerboa or jumping
mice as they are called.
The kangaroo forms an important arti
cle of food, and the flesh is represented
by those who have eaten it as being
somewhat like venison. Soup made of the
th-> Spring Valley Grammar School, and
with the hearty co-operation of all his
teachers, I formed twelve bands in that
school, and in the ensuing months pre
vious to my departure for a two years'
stay in the East I worked in the Den
man, Garfield, Irving, Redding and
Whittier schools, forming fifty-six
bands in all.
During my Eastern visit I carried on
this labor of mercy in various places,
and visited Mr. Angell and his co
workers, from whom I learned much
of the broadening of the work and its
good results.
The summer of 1896 I spent on the isl
and of Unalaska. Alaska, and found the
children thcr<_, notably those of the
Mission Home and of the Russian
schools, very willing to pledge them
selves to kindness to all harmless liv
ing things. While there are no horses
and but few domestic animals on this
island, there are many kinds of birds,
and a few cows, sheep and chickens,
and these they soon learned to treat
as th,- <* should. They gang our Band
of Mercy songs with great enthusiasm
am! were very proud of the Mercy
badges, one of which I gave to each
of -.hem.
In 1597 I visited Honolulu and the Isl
and of Hawaii. I found that the teach
ers in the Government schools were re
quired to instruct their pupils in pa
triotism, temperance and kindness to
animals â in fact, all those virtues
which go to ike good citizens, and so
the way as really paved for me. The
deputy inspector, T. ii. Gibson,
and all the teachers in both the Gov
ernment and independent schools, gave
me hearty co-operation, and it was in
teresting to note how harmoniously the
children of different nations
united in this one idsa of kindness. Ha

WHEN Henry Bergh over thirty-five years ago began single
handed his crusade for the relief of abused dumb creatures in
New York he little realized how great a power for good his
comparatively feeble efforts set in motion. The work that he did
then individually is now performed in almost every town and city by
societies backed by the strong arm of the law, and even the children
have gathered them selves together in "Bands of Mercy" and vie in
friendly rivalry as to who shall most truly and constantly carry out
the principles which he taught both by precept and example.
In San Francisco a new impetus has recently been given to this
especial branch of humane organization by the appointment of a sal
aried organizer whose duty is to visit the schools that have not al
ready formed bands and endeavor to interst them in so doing.
This work was begun here several years ago by Mrs. Maria
Freeman Gray, now vice president of the American Humane Society
and county president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
and by request she has given the following account of her most de
voted and successful labors.
nese all took our world-wide pledge and
gave proof of sincere determination to
keep It in both the letter and the spirit.
The highest class in the Royal (Ha
waiian^ School did not wait for me to
come to them, but hearing of my visit
to other schools wrote out and sent
me the following pledge, which was
signed by each of the sixty-two boys:
HONOLULU, H. 1., Nov. 10, 1899.
Mrs. Gray â Madam: We, the
undersigned pupils of the Rev. Alex
ander Mackintosh, principal of the
Royal School, in the city of Honolulu,
desire to show our interest in the
noble work you have at heart in pro
moting kindness and mercy to living
creatures, so we beg to inform you
that we have united in a band of
mercy' to be called the Kehehuna, or
Royal School Band of Mercy.
I afterward formed four additional
bands in this school.
The teachers and pupils of the Portu
guese school were equally glad to Join
our organization, and F. XV. Da
mon, superintendent of Chinese work
on the Islands, entered earnestly into
the spirit of the cause with the result
that a large number of the young men
of the Mills Institute formed a "Robert
Morrison Band, ' named for the first
missionary to China.
Goo Kirn, a man 60 years of
age and China's highest representative
ln the islands, also signed cur pledge
role, as did his Hawaiian wife, and in
the Chinese Girls" School two very large
bands were formed. In brief, my stay
in Honolulu and Hawaii was productive
of most excellent results, and good re
ports thereof are frequently sent me.
I am pleased to see that ether bands
are here taking up the work which lies
so near my heart. Some of the schools
wherein I instituted Bands of Mercy
In the past have, through changes of
teachers and pupils, allowed the inter
est along these lines to lapse, but in
the Spring Valley Grammar and several
other schools this has not been the case.
The Band of Mercy exercises â con
sisting of songs, recitations and a sort
of "experience meeting," wherein the
children tell of their various experi
ences in trying to lighten the load of
misery which so many animals carry
through life â are gone through with
regularly and by no means perfunc
torily, and the results are seen in the
increased gentleness and refinement of
the young members of this most bene
ficent society.
It Is, indeed, gratifying to me, who
worked against not a little opposition
at first, to see the change in public
sentiment which has taken place in
regard to this matter during the past
few years. It is the fate of pioneers to
suffer, but it is a blessed thing to know
that their 'suffering paves the way for
better things for those who come after
them. MARIE FREEMAN GRAY.

Remains of numerous extinct species of
true kangaroos, many of them of much
larger size than those now in existence,
are abundant in the Pleistocene deposits
of Australia and have hitherto been found
in no other part of the world. Other ani
mals of gigantic size as large as a rhi
noceros lived with these kangaroos in the
came land. One species of the animal is
the rat-kangaroo, which are small -ani
mals, none of them exceeding a common
rabbit in size. They inhabit Australia
and Tasmania, are nocturnal and feed on
the leaves of various kinds of grasses
and other plants, as well as roots and
bulbs, which they dig up with their fore
paws. Then there is a genus commonly
known as the "tree-kangaroo," inhabi
tants of Xew Guinea and chiefly arboreal
in their habits, climbing with facility the
branches of large trees and feeding on
the bark, leaves and fruit. In accord
ance with, this habit their hinder limbs
are comparatively shorter than in ths
true kangaroos and their fore limbs are
longer and more robust and have very;
strong curved and pointed claws.
