Upon His Arrival.
PLANS OF RECEPTION
Elaborate Arrangements Being
Made at New York to Honor
the Hero of Manila Bay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 14.â An inter
esting stage in the work on the
Dewey arch was reached to-day.
The gigantic statues of eight of
the most distinguished naval he- |
roes in American Astory were hoisted j
Into position on the fronts of the arch.
These statues weigh about two tons
each and are twelve feet tall. They
had to be raised by block and tackle, j
and the greatest care was exercised to i
prevent them from being broken. The !
statues of the nava! h.-roes to be placed
in this exalted position are those of j
Hull, Macdonough, Porter, Gushing.
John Paul Jones, Farragut, Lawrence
and Perry.
Madison Square was black with spec
tators while the statues were being
placed In position. The figures were
brought over from Madison Sauare
Garden on drays, followed by noisy
crowds. Sculptors were there to see
that their creations were not broken
or damaged in transit.
Walter Damrosch, who has charge of
the children's chorus in City Hall Park
that will Bing on Saturday morning,
â when the city's loving cup will \>e pre
: to Admiral I >ew.-y. had a con
ference to-day with Warren F. Foster, \
the committee. Damrosch
was accompanied by Miles M. O'Brien
of the Boai ! ol Education. It seems
that provision has been made by the
- for 1200 persons on
;id in front of the City
Hall. Mr. Damrosch wants accomni"
dation for 2500 children, and it will be â 
sary to have further â  ommunica- j
tion with the committee on stands.
With the exception <>f a final decision
the line of march i""r the land pa- ;
rade; the preliminary arrangements for ,
the i. ire about completed. The j
line of march \\:i' be agreed up.>n to
meeting of the commit
i :â â .!':â â '..- are that the â 
. a ay route will be abandoned and
that the procession will march on Fifth
avenue from Fifty-ninth street to
Ington Square. This is the route \
' by Major General Roe, Gen
eral Howard Carroll and all the com- j
manding officers ol in.- regiment who
have beer, cons;; .
An effort was made to-day to mak>' it
appear that the national administration
has been trying- to suppress Admiral I
. as a possible Presidential can
by refusing to participate in his !
ion. The basis of this was Presi- i
â lent McKinley's letter made public on
Wednesday and the declination of the
invitations t" the reception by Secre
taries Hay, Hoot, Smith and others.
The understanding of the citizens'
committee was thai the President and
mcml" met had declined in i
order thit Admiral Dewey should have
a free field, v. ith ro one to divide the
glory of the day with him.
John Philip Sousa has offered his own ;
md those of his band to the!
music committee. Mr. Sousa says h>
would be glad to play in front of the ;
ipla'fl sail rs during the parade.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â M-mbers !
of the Cabinet say that their absence '
from the reception to be given to Ad- !
miral Dewey upon his arrival at New
York must not b" constn -light j
upon the New York committee or as |
indicating any re!u< â¢
the hero of Manila. The reason
neither the President nor his
will take part in th<- New York :â 
tton is that Admiral Dewey is to be
officially welcomed upon his arrival in
Washington, when he will be received
by the President and will be formally j
nted by the Secretary of the Navy
with the sword voted to him by Con
;rr-ss in recognition of his victory in
Manila Bay.
Cabinet officials say that it is flttinc i
that the admiral should be welcomed
nt at the capital of the
nation and that as he is to be wel
come officially here it would be absurd
â ..â¢ the President welcome him un
lly in New York.
As all the members of the Cabinet are
to participate in the < -i!jÂ«i;il welcome I
here, the same reasoning applies to
them. Secretary Root says that the
pressure of public business will prevent
:i in the Dewey celebra
â . York. The Secretary said j
.' take pan in the reception to be,
td the admiral upon his arrival I
in Washington by the President and j
the Cabinet.

PRETORIA, Sept. J4.â The discus

evening, President Kruger hav

Government will draw up the reply in
its final form to-morrow morning and
immediately submit the same to the

strongly influenced by the Orange Free
State and among other features the
maintenance of the convention of 1884
will be strongly asserted.
The situation this evening is hot con

LONDON, Sept. 14.â While the staff
of the Foreign Office will maintain con
tinuous communication to-night with
.Mr. Chamberlain at Birmingham, it is
not believed now that the result of th<
debate in the Volksraad will be received
before Friday. Dispatches from Cape
Town dated midnight attach great im
portance to an article in the Ousland,
the orgaÂ« of the Afridander Bund,
which urges the Transvaal Government
to renew its offer regarding a confer
ence, declaring that there is no reason
why the Transvaal should not accept
a conference and calling attention to
the fact that the word "suzerainty" is
not mentioned by Mr. Chamberlain and
that therefore there is nothing to indi

which conveyed the members of the ex

Sydney. C. 8.. Tuesday. The members of
the Princeton scientific party remained
in Sydney to superintend the shipping of
their collections made during the two
months' cruise.
Of Peary's work Mr. Bridgeman said:
"Peary's results in the first year of the
four allotted to his greatest Arctic work
will fully reward expectation and justify
confidence. What he has already achieved
removes his undertaking from the realm
of doubt to reasonably .certain success."
Mr Bridgeman believes that Peary will
accomplish his purpose and reach the pole
before his four years are up.

This article is understood to be the j
outcome of an important Afrigander ;

There is every reason to believe that ,
Mr. Hofmeyer, the Afrikander leader, j

The Pretoria correspondent of the

(extreme measures may be adopted ex

The matter was brought up by Dr. D.

The authorities here have received no
communication tfom Congress recently,

-1 ent this morning questioned General
S> hwan in reference to the report that
Congress had replied to the offer of
autonomy made by the United States Gov
ernment." This reply, according to the re
port, was to the effect that autonomy
might have been accepted and American
sovereignty recognized by the Filipinos
had it not been that the behavior of die
, Americans indicated that they entertained

i the high-handed methods of the Ameri

Captain White Goes to Manila.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â Captain F.
K. White is detached from the Marine
toria and consult constituents, thereby
avoiding their opposition. This belief
is held in Johannesburg and accounts
fur the hopeful condition of the market,
but the general p"ublic is pessimistic.
The Times publishes the following
from Johannesburg: Mystery sur
rounds the attitude of the Orange Free
State. President Steyn's silence is in
terpreted as showing an intention to
support the Transvaal through thick
and thin, although his inclination at
present is on the side of peace. Public
feeling is running very high, and unless
President Kruger Tnakes an emphatic
pronouncement in favor of conciliation
the majority of the B<Â»ers will inevitably
vote against ary concessions beyond a
seven-year franchise. The Cape Town
correspondent of the Daily News ,says:

MANILA, Sept. 11 (via Hongkong, Sept.

sentenced to death by court-martial and
that Private McÃennett has been con
demned to twenty years' Imprisonment
for having criminally assaulted native
women in Manila a month ago. The

STAGE HELD
OP BY A LONE
HIGHWAYMAN
Daring Robbery of the Lake
port Stage at Desperate
Bend.
A SUSPECT ARRESTED
Effort Will Be Made to Fasten the
Guilt on Him With
Bloodhounds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Sept. 14.â The Napa, Calistoga
and Lakeport stage was held up at 11:45
this morning by a lone highwayman at
Desperate Bend, about one mile south
of the tollhouse. The highwayman was
about five feet and eight inches high,
had light hair and a light complexion.
He had on a black hat, pulled down
over his e*yes, and blue overalls, and
carried a long old-fashioned double
barreled shotgun.
Pointing his gun at the driver's head
the highwayman ordered him to throw
out the express box, which he did. The
passengers were next commanded to
put their money and valuables on the
ground. They were then permitted to
get back into the stage and the driver
was told to go ahead. The robber
gathered up all the valuables, sprang
over a fence and disappeared in the
brush. Soon afterward the passengers
heard three explosions, which were
supposed to be the blowing open of the
express box.
Rev. C. F. Coy, pastor of the Metho
dist Church at Middletown. was a pas
senger returning from the conference
at Pacific Grove and the highwayman
got $5 from him. Coy said, "'I am a
poor preacher and that is all I have."
The robber then handed him back $1.
Newton Stiff, an old resident of Mid
dletown, another passenger, had con
siderable money in his purse, which he
slipped into his boot, giving the rob
ber only his loose change. William
Abbey, a passenger who was on his
way to Adams Springs for his health,
was handed back 50 cents. About $75
was secured from the passengers. The
express box contained very little treas
ure, though the day before it contained
a large amount.
CALISTOGA, Sept. 14.â Sheriff Dun
lap and Constable Allen of Napa and
Constable Spurr and City Marshal
Johnson of St. Helena arrived in town
at 5 o'clock. C. E. Buller joined the
officers here with his bloodhounds, for
merly owned by ex-Sheriff J. R. John
son f>f Mendocino County, and the offi
cera are ra hoi pursuit of the fugitive.
It is believed by some that the rob
ber is George Coburn, the Lake County
outlaw. If so there will be a desperate
battle before he is taken into custody,
if at all. Coburn is so thoroughly ac
quainted with the country that his cap
ture would be almost out of the ques
tion. Others are of the opinion that it
is not Coburn, but a local man. The
description given by some of the pas
sengers is that of a rather tall, slim,
sandy-complexioned fellow.
At 7 o'clock Constable Grauss and
Marshal Nash returned with Joe Weir,
a well-known character, whom they
have arrested as the robber. Quigley,
the driver, made a statement at the
tollhouse that he was satisfied that it
was Weir who held him up. With this
clew to work on the officers soon found
evidence against the accused. Weir
lives about a mile from the scene of the
hold-up, all alone. The bloodhounds
have been started on the track and if
they go to Weir's house no further
search â¢will be made.

BAKERSFIELD, Sept. 14.â Three
women and one man lost thefr
lives in an awful wreck last even-
Ing at Famosa station. The last
victim. Engineer Ed Wright of
north-bound passenger, train No. 8,
succumbed at 8:30 o'clock this morning.
The names of the dead women are: Mrs.
Maggie Majors, Santa Monica; Mrs.
Angie Larue, Piano, and Mrs. Jessie
Ross, Porterville. The latter was the
mother of Mrs. Majors. Mrs. Majors
was instantly killed and her crushed
body was found over one hundred feet
from the wrecked caboose. Mrs. Larue
lived an hour and Mrs. Ross three
hours. â¢ The bodies of both were badly
crushed.
The three women and Trackwalker
Bockstrandt were the only persons on
the caboose when it was struck. Brock
strandt was on the front platform and
was knocked several feet. He sustained
a broken leg and a .serious .cut on the
I face and head and a large splinter was
driven through his right arm. He is in
a serious condition and has been sent
!to the Oakland hospital. After the en
! gine had demolished the caboose and
; two boxcars of the Porterville train It
turned over on its right side. The im
pact of the collision threw the coal for
ward in the cab, covering , Engineer
Wright so that he could not extricate
; himself and there he was held and
! scalded by steam which escaped from
| where the whistle had been broken off.
i Fireman Keller, strange to relate, es
caped with only a few bruises. He can
not tell how it happened. He only
1 knows that he found himself on, Â£ the
i ground ; beside .tho overturned 'engine. "
Before he died, notwithstanding his
great agony, brave Engineer Wright
stated that he did all he could. When
he saw he must strike the caboose he
i turned on the full force of air and re
versed the engine, which literally lifted
the tram from the track; making such
a commotion that people half a- mile
away thought it was an earthquake.
He did not see the caboose until he
was within two hundred feet of it. Its
rear lights were dark.
When the air was turned on the pas
sengers were pitched pellmell from
their seats, many of them being more
or less bruised and cut. One lady's
arm was broken. The baggage car
, withstood the shock, but the coach next
to it, being old and having spliced sills,
could not resist the force of the col
j lision and about twelve feet of the for
ward end crumpled up against the rear
of the baggage car. Here several wo
men were found securely fastened in
the wreck, fortunately uninjured, save
for a few slight scratches.
The two boxcars and caboose of the
Porterville train were smashed to kind
ling wood and the engine thrown from
the track. The Porterville train was
in the act of coupling on to the caboose
when the passenger struck it. Brake-
I man Lowe, who had the pin, saw what
was coming and quickly got out of tho
way.
Those who reached the scene of the
collision soon after it happened were
dumfounded at the horrible sight that
met their gaze, but soon fell to work
to help the injured and dying. In a
little while the dead and dying were
borne to the depot, about two hundred
yards away and placed on improvised
cots and when the special train bearing
HILLARY S. STARR

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 14.-The Times
to-morrow will say: Hillary S. Starr, who
80 suddenly and mysteriously disappeared
from his home on the Otik Knoll ranch,
Pasadena, on the night of April 24 and
under such circumstances as to leave
little doubt in the minds of his family and \
friends and the authorities that he had
met with foul play, is alive, but in a pre
carious condition In a military hosptal in
Manila. Philippine Islands.
He writes under date of Manila, P. 1.,
July 30, to his late employer. S. R. Sniith !
of Riverside and to his wife, the letter â¢
conveying the intelligence that he is aj

tdred skull and asserts absolute ignorance j
of the manner in which he left home, how i
he pame to be enlisted in the Third Artil- \
lery under an assumed name, or how he
received his injuries.
Starr left his ranch house on the even
ing of April 24 to go to the pump house
several hundred feet from his residence, j
From that day he has not been seen by
his family or friends. Marks of a scuffle !
were plainly visible, and the theory of j
murder was borne out by all the circum- j
stances.

surgeons arrived from Bakersfleld they
were at once given attention.
Coroner Buckreus and Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Dorsey were also taken
to the scene on a special train and took
observations. A jury was impaneled
and the dead bodies viewed. Both the
train crews and other witnesses to the
affair were summoned to appear here
at 10 o'clock Sunday and give testi
mony at the Investigation.
After this the bodies of the three
women were taken to Porterville on a
special train and the body of Engineer
Wright was taken to Fresno. Mrs.
Wright arrived on a special train four
hours before her husband died. The
meeting was touching.
Some time after the wreck occurred
the train dispatchers at Kern denied
repeatedly that any one was hurt. The
reason they now offer is that no one
was present to take the responsibility
of giving out such information. They
were willing to tell of the wreck, but
were afraid to tell that any one was
hurt. They claim it is against the rules
to talk, notwithstanding the fact that
the public was interested.
The names of the Porterville train
crew are: Conductor, W. A. Kessler;
engineer, Klwood; fireman, A. S. Be
ford; brakemen, Walter Lowe, C. H.
Buck and Frank Thurman. These are
the men on whom the blame of the
wreck will fall.
From information elicited since the
collision it is learned that No. 8, the
passenger train, had been given orders
here to wait until 10 o'rlock at Famosa
for a south-boynd freight. It was seen
before No. 8 was ready to go out that
the freight could not make Famosa by
that time and the order was annulled
to the freight and to the passenger
train. The operator at Famosa told the
trainmen of the Porterville train of the
order which would have protected them
until 10 o'clock but for the annulment,
of which they did not learn. The freight
stopped at Hunt, the next station north,
and the passenger, which left Bakers
field fifteen minutes late, was only
eleven minutes late at Famosa, and it
was the remaining four minutes upon
which the Porterville train crew count
ed to enable them to get off the main
line. The blame all rests with the crew
of the Porterv .le train, who well knew
they took desperate chances while oc
cupying the main line on the passenger
train's time.
It is further stated that the Porter
ville train has in the past been known
to carelessly loiter on the main line too
close on the time of through trains. All
who have visited the scene of the wreck
declare that somebody Is criminally
responsible for its occurrence and -the
cruel loss of life.
The blame for the terrible accident at
Famosa is attributed by the Southern
Pacific officials to the crew of the
freight train. They say that they can
see no reason for the accident except in
the gross carelessness of those having
charge of the freight train and in their
utter disregard of every rule of rail
roading in switching on the main track
without taking the proper precautions
to protect their train from even the
slightest possibility of a collision. Their
conduct appears to be all the more
reprehensible from the fact that the
passenger train was nine minutes be
hind time and those directing the
freight could not but have known that
it was expected to arrive at any mo
ment.
Moreover, the Southern Pacific .offi
cials say, that even if the train was on
the main track against orders they can
not understand how the accident could
have occurred, as the country there is
perfectly level and has nothing along
the line of track which should pre
vent an obstruction as large as a
freight train being seen for many miles
in the daytime, and on a clear night it
f'ould easily be perceived in plenty of
time to prevent any such mishap as
the one which has just caused such an
appalling loss of life.
MEMBERS OF PHILIPPINE
COMMISSION RECALLED
! The President Desires to Consult
With Them Concerning the Re
sult of Their Lahors.
WASHINGTON", Sept. 14.â The recall of
Colonel Denby and Professor Worcester
of the Philippine Commission is for the
purpose of bringing the members of the
commission together in this city in No
vember next, in order that they may
frame a report to the President which
may be transmitted to Congress with' hi 3
message.
Their suggestions regarding the char
acter of government to be given the Fili
pinos will guide the President in his re
commendations. It was supposed that
Professor Worcester, who. by reason of
his long acquaintance with leading Fili
pinos, has probably accomplished more
in the direction of keeping other tribes
from joining the Tagalfl than any other
member would continue in the islands for
some months longer. The President how
ever has concluded that he would like
all civilian members of the commission
here and it has been Thought by some
I that he micrht utilize this as an excuse
for recalling Major General Otis. It was
! positively stated to-night, however, that
; instructions for the members of the com
| mission still in Manila to return^ to the
! t'nlted States did not include General
1 Otis and there are no indications that he
I is to be recalled.

BODY OF THOMAS
DAUGHERTY FOUND
Disappeared From His
Home Last October.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GILROY, Sept. 14.â The body of Thomas
L. Daugherty, who mysteriously .disap
peared from Gllroy last October, waa
found this morning by James Mossi and
i.. >rge Koeler of this city. Mossi and
Keeler were nut hunting for deer on the
Wallace ranch, about ten miles west of
Giiroy, in the redwoods.
The spot where the body was found is
â¢ on a hillside, densely wooded and covered
with underbrush. The men thought there
were prospects of scaring up a deer on
this hillside, When they came across the
body uf a man lying on his back, with his
coat off and used as a pillow. A large
Colt's revolver was hanging in a iimo
within reach and over the body, pointing
downward. By the head lay a curkeu
whisky bottle. A white felt hat lay near
bl The head was severed from the bodi
es as devoid of flesh. The rest of the
body Beemed Intact, though the men did
not stop to examine it closely. One oi tre
ta seemed torn, as i; bj wild animals.
â  The clothes were of a grayish color and
badly rotted.
The men came to town and in company
wit!-. Constable Jack White and an under
taker left again for the scene to bring
the bod) to town.
There is no doubt that the remains aro
those of Daugherty, for both men were
well acquainted with him and the cloth
ing tallies, exactly with that worn by
Daugherty when he disappeared a year
ago.
L>augherty was a former City Marshal
u:><\ Constable oi Giiroy. lie was more
than t'i years of age. and in a state
oi temporary aberration wandered from
his home. When last seen lie was er< --.:.u
--the. li -id opposite his home, going toward
the hills where his body was found. Al
though a diligent search was made at the
time by. his friends not a trace of the
man could be found.
Kate to-night Mrs. l>aujjherty identified
the pistol and scabbard found with the*
body as those of her husband. It is
thought, however, that he took strych
nine, as half a bottle of the poison was
found in his clothes. There was some
whisky in the bottle by his Bide and a
white sediment in tin- bottom gives fur
ther proof that he died from the poison.
The body was brought to town by ("nn
staMe whlti . In :â¢ rtaker Dobbs and
M sefand Keeler, who found the remains.
An Inquest will be held by Coroner Kell
P'riday at 1 <V clock.

Croker. "You're here for one side only,
\ and for one purpose only. I've been look

In this city. I will give what I know to
the press here to-day. I have here a de
cision from the Supreme Court."

TO JOSEPH KAHNY
Decision on a Puzzling
Land Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING. Sept 14.â Word has just
been received by Attorney F. W. Smith
that the Secretary of the Interior has de
cided that the three mining claims situ
ated between Taylor postoffice and the
town of Keswick belong to Joseph Kahny
of this city.
The decision settles an important point
in mining law and quiets title on property
over which murder has been committed
since the suit began. About a year ago
Joseph Kahny applied' to the United
United States Land Office for a patent on
two quartz and one placer claim. nv niie
the application was going through the
usual channel incident to its granting tne
claims were' jumped by John Pendleton

tended that Kahny] had t. 0 Â«fÂ» te Â« llt Â°'?
rights by applying for a single .patent
covering botn quartz and P> ace r c '* lm f â¢
and that such patent could not issue.

of the Interior. In the meanwhile John
O'Hair had disposed of his interest and
John Pendleton and two others were
working the property as j placer claims*
Four weeks ago Jake Handle of Keswick,

ago a rich ledge of gold was uncovered.
Then the trouble arose between the two
claimants and on September 5 Pendleton
shot Handle dead from his cabin window.

MILITARY AND CIVIL
OFFICIALS AT THE FAIR
Day of Sightseeing and Handshaking Termi
nates With a Banquet in the Assembly
Chamber of the Capitol Building,
Scenes and Incidents at the State Fair.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. , Such a
scene as was witnessed, in this city
to-night has never been equaled in
the history of the great State of
California, for the extraordinary
enthusiasm that prevails in connection
with the State Fair is the attending cir
cumstances of Governor's day and Sacra
mento day combined.
The Governor of California was not only
the guest of the directors of the State
Agricultural Society, but he was the
guest also of the citizens of this city rep
resented in their citizens' State Fair Club,
to whom is due nearly all the credit for
the genuine success of the forty-sixth an
nual State Fair. To make the occasion
a momentous Â«ne high United States mil
itary and naval officers were invited.
They came in large numbers and were
graciously received by the people of the
community and In a manner such as
others have seldom been received before.
As a result of the efforts put forth by
those connected directly and indirectly
with the management of the fair to make
it the success it surely is the pavilion
was packed to-night with humanity.
Old people who have resided in this city
from early childhood say that they have
never before seen such a large number
of people in the pavilion at any one time.
* The information that Major General
Shatter of the United States.army and
Rear Admiral Kautz of the United States
navy and their attending officers and
prominent National Guard officers would
attend the fair had much to do with the
general outpouring of the populace. Their
desire to see an officer of high rank or
either the army or the navy who gained
renown in the cause of his country was
gratified to their entire satisfaction.
General Shatter and Admiral Kautz
and other prominent United States army
and navy officers, and Major General
Dickinson and other prominent National
Guard officers arrived on this morning's
train from San Francsico. With them
came also Governor Lee of South Da
kota, Adjutant General Lambert, repre
senting Governor Lind of Minnesota; offi
cers of the Minnesota regiment. Chaplain
Leary of the staff of the Governor of
Minnesota, Colonel Duboce and other offi
cers of the Frst California Volunteers.
The distingufshed visitors were met at
the depot by members of the Citizens'
State Fair Committee and Troop B (cav
alry), of this city, who escorted them to
the Capitol, whereÂ»they paid their re
spects to the Governor. At the conclusion
of the reception in the Governor's office
they proceeded to the Golden Eagle Ho
tel for luncheon. .
In the afternoon they went to Agricul
tural Park, accompanied by the Governor,
where the entire party was received by
the directors of the State Agricultural
Society, whose especial guests they were
while at the park.
From 6 o'clock until 9 this evening there
COMPANY I BANQUETED.
Volunteers Entertained by the Old
San Francisco Fusileers.
The ex-members of Company I. Nation
al Guard of California, and the members
of the San Francisco Fusileers' Benefit
Fund gave a banquet last evening: at Cal
ifornia Hall. 620 Bush street, in honor of
the return from the Philippines of Com- j
pany I, First California Volunteers. Ta
bles were set for 150. The affair â¢was in i
the nature of a reunion of the old San j
Francisco Fusileers, formed in 1871. While j
the organization has been rearranged and i
rechrlstened four or five times, its mem- i
bers have always staid together. When j
the war with Spain broke out those of
Company I who were not bound by ties |
that prevented them from going to the ;
front at once offered their services to
Uncle Bam. and were mustered in as Com- j
pany I. First California Volunteers. It ;
was In honor of the return of these men
and as an expression of appreciation for â¢
i the valor and bravery they displayed on ;
j the battlefield that last evening's banquet ,
! was given.
The spread, a most elaborate one. was
arranged by Huber brothers, both of
whom are members of the company. The â¢
banquet hall was decorated with the na- <
' tional colors and there was a profusion
Of evergreens and flowers. The tables
were arranged In the shape of a hollow
square in the center of which accommo

THE PAIS" FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 % 1899.
! assembled in the Assembly chamber in
I the Capitol one of the most brilliant sath
i erings ever witnessed in the far West.
I The occasion was a banquet to the Gov
i ernor and staff. Governor Lee of South
; Dakota, General Shafter, Admiral Kautz
j and the officers of the army and navy and
'< the National Guard of California. The
I banquet was given by the Citizens' State
i Fair Club. State officials and officers of
j the National Guard in this city, and there
were seated at the banquet tables be
tween 2vO and 300 persons. General Shafter
and Admiral Kautz and nearly ail the
army and navy officers were in full dress
uniform.
A telegram was read from ex-Governor
Budd expressing his regrets that he was
unable to attend, owing to indisposition.
and extending his congratulations to the
| Governor for his success and best wishes
for future prosperity.
Attorney General Tirey I* Ford was
toastmaster of the occasion. He intro
duced the Governor, who responded to the
toast "Our Governor," and was received
with cheers.
The Governor referred In eulogistic
terms to the career of General Shafts,
Admiral Kautz, the California troops
and the troops of other States in the
Philippines. He. spoke glowingly of the
State Fair, and thanked his hosts for the
i toa&ts assigned to him.
The reception of General Shafter was
i much more enthusiastic than that ten
i dered the Governor. The history of the
army, he said, is unequaled and unparal
'< leled since the independence of the coun
' try was established. He referred in high
terms to the loyalty of the regular and
volunteer troops. "The armies of the
country have been successful in four
j wars," said the general, "In which the
i regulars and volunteers were moved to
| love one another. There Is no party in
â  existence that can Induce them to become
disloyal in any degree."
Admiral Kautz was received with a
demonstration equal to that in honor of
Shafter. The admiral's remarks were of
'â  a humorous nature and intensely inter
esting.
The banqueters cheered to the echo
when Governor Lee of South Dakota was
introduced by Attorney General Ford.
He said he had reason to be proud of
California, San Francisco and the State
Red Cross Society for the many acts of
kindness to the South Dakota troops.
Adjutant General Lambert represented
Governor Lind of Minnesota, who. the
General said, was unavoidably absent.
On behalf of Governor Lind he thanked
the people of California for the kind at
i tention they bestowed upon the troops
of the North Star State while they were
In California.
The next speaker was Father Leary,
chaplain attached to the staff of Gov
ernor Lind. He was a very inter
tra; toast, "Our Departed Comrades," C.
Thierbach; selection, "Auld Lang Syne,"
orchestra.
The committee in charge of thÂ» arrar.ge
m-nts consisted of John D. Slebe, J. D.
Ralpf, Colonel A. Huber, L. Haake. J.
Siebe, C. Thierbach. C. Paul. L. Thier
bach, C. Corcoran and H. Day.
FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.
Superintendent Hewitt Recommends
Its Extension and Improvement.
Superintendent Hewitt of the Fire '
Alarm and Police Telegraph filed his an
nual report with the Board of Supervisors
ypst^rday. and he recommended that pro
vision should be made in the next tax levy
for 300 new fire boxes, the placing of
municipal wires underground, a direct tel
ephone system connecting all department
stations with the central office and new
quarters for the office of the department.
He states that the circuits are danger
ously overloaded and of extreme length,
and more room is needed.
The superintendent reports that he has
ordered an emergency circuit placed in all
hotels, theaters and other public build-
Ings, so arranged that the building may
be left in darkness excepting single lights
over exits and in passageways. They will
be controlled by a switch near the main
entrance and accessible to firemen and
the police. He calls attention to the fact
that this is the only large city in the
United Statps that has no order regu
lating the installation of electric wires
according to the rules of the National
Board of Underwriters. He recommends
the passage of an ordinance empowering
the department to issue certificates under
those rules certifying to the efficiency of
the work done.
During the fiscal year ending June 30
last the department received S2B alarms
and 87.427 police calls. The equipment con
sists of 267 gongs and tappers, 531 miles
of wire. 22?2 cells of battery, 278 fire box
es. 200 police boxes, 43 engine house ser
â¼toes and 5 central police systems. The '
service has been extended to Ocean View,
and, with other extensions, required 257
poles and 70 miles of wire.
Ha estimates that the wiring; of all en
esting talker, and said that when the
troops of his State return the splendid
hospitality shown them by California wlil
be referred to in thousands of Minnesota
homes.
When Colonel EHiboce of the First Cali
fornia was introduced the banqueters al
most went wild with enthusiasm. His
remarks were brief and were chiefly con
fined to the loyalty of rhe members of
thÂ° National Guard of California, of whom
the volunteer regiments from California
were mostlty made up of.
Director Grove L. Johnson made a short
address in place of A. B. Spreckels. presi
dent of the State Agricultural Society,
who was suddenly called away from the
capital. Mr. Johnson, on behalf of the
society, invited all present to visit the
pavilion.
R. B. Carpenter responded to the toast
"Our Country." Every one knows what
the country is. he said. The people are
prosperous and happy, which Indicates the
state of existing conditions, although the
soldiers of the country are in active serv
ice against another people. He decried
the efforts of alleged traitors in the
United States to belittle the efforts of
the constituted authorities to carry out
the policy they have planned for the Phil
ippines. What a difference there Is be
tween the United States and France, he
said. In France they are trying an inno
cent man accused of being a traitor, while
in this country they permit a traitor to
go unpunished.
While the committee had done every
thing in its power to make the banquet
a success, it was marred by two unfore
seen occurrences. The first was that
Tirey L. Ford was not in fit condition to
preside and the second was an, asinine
joke piayed by Secretary Lelong of the
State Horticultural Society.
The committee had arranged to provide
the guests â army, navy and State of
ficials â with two-bit risars. but Mr. Le
long juggled with the cigars and passed
a loaded article around. Of course, when
lit, the cigars exploded. Everybody was
disgusted with the perpetration of such
a joke on such an occasion. They left
the table and went away from the ban
quet hall.
At the conclusion of the banquet all
marched to the pavilion, where the Club
of '96 held a reception in honor of the dis
tinguished visitors. General Shafter de
livered a short address to the thousands
of spectators. Admiral Kautz, the Gov
ernor. Governor Lee of South Dakota and
Colonel DubocÂ« of the First California
Volunteers were each introduced to the
people and were heartily received.
To-morrow night President A. B.
Spreckels will give a banquet at the Sut
ter Club to the Citizens' Executive Com
mittee of Sacramento, which has done
so much to make the State Fair a suc
cess.
gine houses for the silent alarm system,
which Is now in progress, will require 20,
--000 feet of main conduit. 20,0)0 feet of lat
eral conduit, 39 manholes, 41 boxes, 45,000
feet of cable and 600.000 feet of conductor.
All the trench work has been completed,
and all that Is necessary is to draw .he
cables through the conduits and the erec
tion of new fire boxes.

Flea fÂ»r Home-Made Cigars.
At a meeting of the Pacific Coast Beer
Bottlers" Protective Association held yes
terday the question of giving encourage
! ment to local cigar-makers was discussed.
I It was stated that there are at the pres
i ent time very few local white men en
] gaged in the manufacturing of cigars, j In
i order to show the sympathy of this as
sociation for the cigar-makers of San
I Francisco the following resolutions were
: adopted:
Whereas, The promising outlook for home
manufactures has encouraged the' cigar
makers Of San Francisco to Inaugurate
a movement for. the rehabilitation of their
Industry In this metropolis, and believing
that there Is no good reason -why. the Cali- .
fornia made cigars should not be restored'
to full popularity in this community, bring
ing to every retail tradesman In San Fran
cisco direct pecuniary benefits and to every
citizen the . Indirect benefits \ that come
from an increasing permanent population
and the steady expansion of our manufac
turing industries, therefore be it
Resolved, That the Pacific Coast Beer
Bottlers' Protective Association hereby
pledges its moral support to the movement
now on foot under the direction of the San
Francisco Protective Association to secure
a fair division of patronage to home made
; cigars, and to do everything In Its power to
I restore to full favor in this community tha
California blue label cigar.

DESTRUCTION OF
THE SATURNUS
Steamer Captured by
Filipinos.
Spectal Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, Sept. 14.â report has
been received by mail at the War Depart
ment giving an account of the capture |
and destruction of the steamer Saturnus, '
which carried $40,000 in cash and a valu- j
able cargo. The report follows:
The United States gunboat Pampanga ar
rived here yesterday morning bringing news of
the capture of the steamer Saturnus, belonging
to the Compania Maritima. The facts as gath
ered from those who know are as follows:
The Saturnus sailed from Manila on the |
morning of July M for San Fernando de la ]
Union, on the north side of the Gulf or Lin- |
gayan Cayvian. Currlmao and Aparrt. all of
which are northern ports. It is supposed the
vessel arrived off San Fernando on the 31st
ult. When discovered by the gunboat Pam- j
panga she was lying with her nose buried In
the sand of the shore south of the city of San
Fernando. Both anchors were out and smoke,
which hovered closely over the vessel, showed
her to be on fire. Small boats with native
crews could be seen carrying the cargo of the
burning vessel ashore.
Little suspecting the true condition of affairs,
the gunboat Pampanga sent a boat out to the j
burning vessel to investigate, but upon the ap- :
I proach of the boat with her American blue
jackets the natives immediately retired and [
opened fire upon the boat's crew, using Mauser â 
and, Remington rifles from concealed trenches |
and sending shells from two three-Inch guns, :
which formed a concealed battery, over and |
close to the little boat.
The watchful officers on the Pampanga Im- j
mediately ordered the fire from the rebel j
trenches to be returned by the crew of the gun
boat and under cover of the guns of the war
' ship' the boat reached the Saturnus. A brief
I inspection of the vessel showed every Indica
( tion that she had been looted by the rebels,
i but the examination failed to disclose any sign
lof the crew or anything to indicate that a j
' struggle had taken place on board. The boat's
: crew then attempted to raise the anchors, but,
i falling in this, they cut the anchor chains and
i attached a hawser from the Pampanga to the
â¢ propeller of the Saturnus. An attempt was then
made to pull her out of the mud and sand, but
1 was unsuccessful.
The Pampanga then abandoned the wrecked
Saturnus an signaled the Concord, which was
sighted as she was crossing the Gulf of Lin
gayan, and reported all the facts of the dis
covery to her commander. The Pampanga was
thereupon ordered to Manila to report the af
â  fair while the Concord remained to attend the
rebels and the wreck. "When the gunboat left
the scene the flames on the Saturnus had en
veloped the vessel, and she, to all appearances,
was doomed.
The Saturnus was commanded by Captain
1 Antonio Aralueea and had two officers, three
1 engineers and a crew of thirty-six natives. It
' is supposed that all were taken prisoners by the
: rebels.
The carsro of the vessel consisted of 520 cases j
Of petroleum, of ten gallons to the case; 600
demijohns of wine. 143 barrels of wine. SO sacks
of rice, 10 cases of linen cloth. 7 cases of money,
containing $40.00") In cash, and 1496 packages
and bales of various kinds. In addition to the
i cargo the vessel carried twenty-six passengers
i and two children, all of whont were either
Filipinos or Chinese.
I There Is absolutely no truth In the rumor of
the assassination or murder of the crew of the
vessel.

pania General de Tobacco, which sailed a few
days after the Saturnus for the same port, re
turned yesterday with the information that the
United States gunboat Paragrua refused per
mission to her to enter the port of San Fer
nando and ordered her to return to Manila.
It is generally believed that a portion of the
crew, and perhaps some of the passengers, were
in league with the rebelu and. knowing that the
Insurgents had a concealed battery planted
there, ran the vessel ashore under the rebel
(Tuns so as to make the looting free and easy
and the capture oÂ£ the vessel and Its valuable '
cargo, together with its officers, moie com
plete with little danger to themselves.
A subsequent report received here states that i
the crew anjd passengers of the Saturnus were !
all safe and uninjured at Tarlac the Filipino <
capital. It was expected that the crew an 1
passengers would arrive in Manila soon as It 'â 
was said that they were free to go wherever :
they pleased unmolested. The Saturnus was ,
fully insured against loes, including the risk j
of war.
Lively Drawn Battle.
WATERBURT, Conn., Sept. 14.â Dan
Murphy of Waterbury and Australian
Jimmy Ryan fought a twenty-round
draw before the Waterbury Athletic Club, j
In the second round Ryan landed a solar I
plexus blow on Murphy, which caused the j
latter to hang to the ropes. Ryan did not i
follow up his advantage, however. In the j
succeeding round Murphy did the leading, j
landing frequently on th* face and head, j
but In almost every case Ryan came back I
with wicked righthand swing's on Mur- j
phy's wind. In the final round Murphy !
went at his man in hammer and tongs i
fashion and punished him severely.
He could not find the jaw, however, for
I a knockout.
Hart Gets the Decision.
STOUX CITY. lowa. Sept. 14.â ThÂ«
feature of the second night of Tommy
White's fistk: carnival was a fifteen
round battle between Sig Hart and
"Australian" Bill Murphy. Both men
were aggressive, and the battle was hot
from the opening round until the close.
Hart, although a head and a half shorter
than Murphy, who also had a much long
er reach, put up the most scientific fight,
and was awarded the decision on points
at the end of the fifteenth round.
FOUGHT HIS CAPTORS.
Frederick Gilbert, a Maniac, Gives
Four Policemen Battle.
Frederick Gilbert, a lithographer, living
at 1522 O'Farrell street, suddenly became i
insane last night and drove his hand â 
through a window in his home, cutting a ,
deep gash in the wrist. His mother, hear
ing the crash, entered the room occupied
by her son and found him wrapping a
blanket around his wrist. As his actions
denoted that he had suddenly lost his
a, Mrs. Gilbert summoned Police
man Aiken. who started to take him into
custody. Gilbert vigorously resisted his
efforts and a desperate struggle ensued, j
With the assistance of three other police-J
men. who were attracted to the house by
thf> maniacal screams of Gilbert. Aiken
finally bound him with ropes and dragged
him from the house. He was then placed
in tie patrol wagon and driven to the Re
ceiving Hospital. Police Surgeon Heintz, :
who was supposed to be on duty at the
time, could not be found and Dr. Hartley, ;
his former interne, who happened to be
present, was compelled to dress the
wound in Gilberts wrist. He was after
ward removed to the insane department ;
and locked up in a padded cell.
It is claimed that Gilbert was formerly
an inmate of Agnews Asylum for the In- \
sane.

SACRAMENTO FAIR.
Finishes in Eastern Races.
GARRETT COCHRAN WILL
LEAD THEM TO VICTORY
BERKELEY, Sepi U ivrkeley collegians attributed their last football
victory to enthusiasm and to Garret! Cocbiun. If to-day's outburst is
any indication of how the Blue and Gold will fare during the coming
season, Berkeley ought to do great things on the gridiron. Cochran
arrived to-day. The whole university turned out to give him a rous
ing welcome.
The big coach reached Sixteenth-street Station, Oakland, on this morn
ing's Southern Overland train. There his reception was worthy of a football
hero. Over 250 students braved the penalties of being absent from college
exercises and went in a body from the university town to be present at the
depot when Cochran arrived. Their good spirits led them to play tricks with
the Southern Â±-a< irtc. and that corporation is out of 250 douo.e fares which
legitimately belong to it. Once on the train, the men realized themselves
masters of the situation, and, piling into the last car. locked the door and
refused to let in the conductor. That functionary's efforts to collect fares
resulted In his being checkmated at every attempt, and the people at Six
teenth-street Station were surprised to see a carload of students pile out of
the windows of the smoker as soon as the Berkeley local stopped. In a hen
roost near the c -pot the men found a rooster. They decorated the bird with
blue and gold ribb ins, and, as Cochran stepped off hi? train, presented it to
him with cheers and yells.
Cochran was evidently much pleased with his reception. He is looking
in splendid condition, and seems much improved after a year's rest. This
afternoon he made his first appearance upon the football field. Professors
and students lined the- bleachers and joined in the cheering as the big coach
came on the gridiron and shook hands with th< Football men. After a light
practice Cochran declared that Berk-ley had a harder tussle than ever be
fore her this year, and that the men would have to get down to steady
work at once.

UNION PARK
Scott's Big Greyhound Beats Out
Merry Maiden for tha
Reserve Stake.
Midweek coursing at Union Park s^ma
to have struck the popular taste. The re
serve stake yesterday served to attract
there more than 2000 people, who were
given more than the ordinary amount of
| sport. The hares, as a rule, were strong,
some remarkably so, and the courses werÂ»>
iat times exciting-. E. & R. Scott's Lord
i'.yron beat E. F. Passon's Maiden to first
money after that active hound had dis
posed of Maiii of Erin in one of the most
stubbornly contested runs of the day, the
hare escaping.
Easy money tickets were torn up in the
tirst round by those who were certain
Eiasel Dell could beat Montana. They
think she can ypt, but she didn't jresi r
â  day, bt-ing away off t'nrm ::f. ;l result, of a
! grueling course Bbfi received last Sunday
at Ingleside. She was badly beaten.
Wondering Tom, who was put out in the
i third round by O X Capitol, got the flag
in the second round from Little Joker.
After a short undecided Tom and the
Joker were slipped after one of those de
mon hares you read about. He ran them
i ail over the lot, flirted with them at one
;of the escapes, refused to take it and
headed away trom them in the direction
or the slips. Wondering Tom taking a
nasty fall on the way. It finally became
necessary to slip another dog, who ran in
and killed.
The linal round was not long in doubt.

It by reason of the grueling Riven to the

BROKEN GAFF OF THE
SHAMROCK BEING FIXED
During the Interim the Yacht Will
Continue Her Trial Spins
With the Old Boom. f
NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â "Will" Fife Jr.
and his associates were busy to-day re
pairing the Shamrock's gaff topsail. The
spars were sent to the yard early in the
morning, and W. D. Dickey, manager of
the plant, was asked to hurry the work
required. The collapsed racing gaff had
to be repaired, as there was no duplicate
of It among the numerous spars sent over
by Mr Fife The yard officials put some
of their best machinists on the Job but
could not promise to complete It for two
or three days.
Under these circumstances, which Mr
Fifo partly anticipated. it was decided to
lengthen the old gaff to the size of the
racing spar, so that the yacht could have
a trial test to-morrow over a logged-off
course. A3 the yacht's practice spins in
American waters have been limited, Mr
tire is now becoming somewhat anxious
and will take advantage of every suita
ble day until the craft is docked to put
her in thorough racing shape.
Both the racing gaff and that used on
the old mainsail are of nickel steel. In the
gaff that collapsed and which is now being
repaired the steel is three-sixteenths of
an inch In thickness. This gaff is sixty
seven feet, long to an inch, which, al
though formidable enough, is five feet
less than experts and wiseacres had es
timated it.. As the old gaff was sixty
three feet ten inches long, the addition
given to it is three feet two inches. These
figures give an inkling of the extent to
which Mr. Fife has increased the area
of the. Shamrock's mainsail since she was
sailed with the cutter Britannia.
Both gaffs are made after the manner
of an old-fashioned stovepipe, and nave
no Inside bracing.

BIG COURSING EVENTS.
Franey's Death an Accident.
NEW RACE
PARK FOR
THE CAPITAL
Wealthy Citizens of Sacra-
mento Plan to Purchase a
Fin* Tract of Land.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 14.â Sacramento's
citizens are wildly enthusiastic over the
success of the State Fair of 1*99. They
have just realized that success can be
achieved by a display of concerted en
ergy. The citizens formed a State Fair
Club and decided to inject liberal supplies
of ginger into the annual exposition. Old
methods were discarded and the result
has been decidedly gratifying; in fact, it
has exceeded the wildest dream of the
most enthusiastic promoters.
The citizens have been fearful for some
months past that they might lose the
State Fair, as there lias been a hitch in
the efforts to dispose of tlie present park,
which is located almost fn the heart of
the city and which has grown too small
for the purpose* for which it, is intended.
The Legislature gave authority to sell the
present park and purchase a new one, but
for .some reason. there was a hitch, and
the people had about made up their minds
that nothing would be donee- â¢ - â  :
The Call's correspondent learned, to
night of a project which has been.inaugu
rated by some of the wealthiest citizens
of Sacramento, which will, if carried out,
give to California's- capital one of .the
finest racing parks on me Pacific Coast.
The plan of the projectors is to purchase
a great tract of land near the city, put
up modern clubhouses and grandstands,
construct a track and stables, pay off the
indebtedness of the State Agricultural
Society and turn the new park over to the
society in exchange for â the , present
grounds.' The indebtedness is about $29,000.
The citizens who are working upon this
scheme are not in it for selfish .motives.
They have the interests of the. city at
heart. They intend, in the event of the
success of their plans, to ' convert ,, the
present racing grounds into a bedutlful
driving park. Old fences and buildings
will be torn down and trees, flowers and
shrubs will be planted. A mile track will
be maintained for pleasure driving and
there will be roadways where parties may |
turn out or drive out at quarter or half
mile points. The scheme is meeting with
great encouragement and will no . doubt
be carried out.

Caller Dinue announced through a mega
i phone the approaching arrival of the
I Governor and staff, also General Shatter
and Admiral Kautz. guests of the occa
sion. Escorted by Troop B, Cavalry, the
vehicles containing the distinguished vis
itors paraded before the stand, the band
struck up a national air and strangely
enough the crowd refused to enthuse.
Even when three cheers were proposed
for his excellency but two or three hol
low, cracked and clammy voices respond
ed, 'the southern Governor is not very
I popular in this northern part of the State.
j General Shatter graciously responded by
raising his cap in acknowledgment of
the hearty welcome accorded him.
The racing was no different from any
other day, four favorites meeting with
defeat, and the books drawing an eagle
bird. Neernut, rank and unsteady, was a
bitter disappointment in the 2:13 trot,
which went to Galttte Wilkes in straight
heats. The Autumn handicap for two
year-olds over a mile fell to Bathos, su
perbly ridden by Frank Duffy. Cromwell
defeated a small field for the Capital City
stake. .
In the event for Sacramento County
roadsters, Regina F, driven by "Billy"
Lampert, won, the mare proving oil from
the can. Peo, over which F. E. Wright
held the reins, ruled a slight favorite
over Regina in the opening betting, but
the mare headed him throughout in each
hfat. Harry, driven by Clarence Nelson,
and Lady, with A. \V. O'Brien in the bike,
had the red bunting swished in their faces
the first heat.
A nicely balanced field of eight scored
for the word in the 2:13 class trot, with
Neernut a commanding favorite. The San
ta Ana horse acted cranky in the first
heat and was beaten hands down by Ga
lette Wilkes, driven by Charley Durfee.
Neernut was even a stronger choice for
the next heat, but the brown mare again
repeated the trick without a bobble in
2:14%, This time Hazel Klnney was sec
ond and Claudius third.
The first running event left a deep dark
brown taste in the mouths of many spec
tators. It was a six-furlong sprint, with
Amasa heavily played at odd? of 4 to 5
throughout. Of the others Yule, with
Butler up, seemed to be the only one try
ing. Mafada, Novia and Mike Rice could
all three have beaten the winner.
Mat Storn thought very highly of the
chances of his youngster Sunello for the
Autumn handicap, and the public coin
sent him to the post favorite. Loullier
rode one of his bungling races, finally
ending up In the show. Duffy, astride
Bathos, a 5 to 1 chance, stole away in the !
lead, and in a drive at the end led Bogus
Bill past the judges over a length in I:4BVs-
The Capital City stake, at one mile and
a furlong, was gathered in by Cromwell,
the even money choice, piloted by Maek
lin. Monrovia cut out the running for
nearly a mile, when she was collared and
beaten out five lengths. Grady disposed
of Mlstleton for the show. ,
Flush of Gold was plunged on to win
the five-furlong dash for two-year-olds,
but was slow to leave the post, and
Druidess won al! the way. The favorite
came with a rush, leading out Rose of
Hilo for the place.
A six-furlong selling run closed the
afternoon's sport- Donator. well ridden
by Morse and a mild favorite in the ring,
tame from behind, and in a hard drive
downed the 15 to 1 shot. Somis. a head.
Negligence, after making the running,
died away, just managing to get the
show.

FOOTBALL
PRACTICE IS
COMMENCED
Coach Chamberlin at Stan
ford Gives the Men Their
First Lesson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 14.â
Between forty and fift<- football men were
out last Tuesday and received their first
lesson from Coach Chamberlin. He is
quite pleased with the material at his dis
posal. The only fault he has to find is
that they are mostly light. But this lack
wi!l be remedied when. "Babe" Burnett,
Cairns, De Forest, Dole, Wrigley and
Leavitt appear on the field. Another man
who may do some great work for Stan
ford is Christy, a two hundred pounder
j from Los Angeles, who has had three
years' experience as guard on the Uni-
I versity 01 Southern California team. De
I Forest of Portland is another man with
I a good football record who is expected.
> The rtturn of the First California Regi
i ment brings back besides Burnett, the
I great '97 center, "Guiby" Dole, guard on
I the 'Ol's freshman team; Leavitt, sub end
on the '91 'varsity, and Wrigley, a sub
guard the same year.
There is an abundance of material for
the freshman team. At present it is im
â  possible to make any forecast of what
j the personnel of the team will be. "Jack"
Reynolds and Lewers, old 'varsity heroes
of the '95 team, now of the law faculty,
will devote much time to the baby team,
thus relieving Chamberlin of this work.
Some of the more promising candidates
as they have shown up in practice so far
are Traeger and Lee for line positions,
P. Parker, John, Grider and Campbell for
halfs. Geer, Thayer and Roberts are
out for full backs, with the chances prob
ably even. For quarter, Luck, captain of
the West Aurora. 111.. High School team,
is the most promising candidate. With
the exception of center, there are plenty
of candidates for the other positions.
Another week will mark a great advance
ment on the gridiron at Stanford, as the
coach is hero at work and all the men
have suits who have applied for them.

AGAINST TRUSTS
In Favor of Their Com
plete Annihilation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Sept. 14.â Enthusiastic inter
est and a crowded hall put to-night's
session of the conference on trusts sharp
ly in contra.--, with the forenoon and aft
ernoon gatherings. Central Music Hall
was packed with an audience that repre
sented, nearly every class of people. Gov
ernor Pir.gree of Michigan was the star
attraction. The Governor was received
with applause so fervent that it was some
rr.lr.utes tx fore he could proceed with hfs
address. He was obliged to rise several
times after taking his seat and bow ac
knowledgment before the audience would
allow the chairman to introduce the next
speaker.
The house was divided against Itself
during- the address of the next speaker
ex-Secretary of the Treasury Charles
Foster. The audience finally became so
demonstrative In interrupting the speaker
with questions and remarks that a dele
gate asked the chairman to clear the gal
leries unless the Interruption ceased.
Governor Pingree's subject was "Th?
Effect of Trusts on Our National. Life and
Citizenship."
He began by mildly criticizing the Civic
ration of Chicago, declaring that ir
all of the sixty-nine questions distributed
by the Federation broadcast over the
country, as a means of gathering mater
ia.l for the use of the conierence. only om
question related in any way to the effect
of trusts upon society. He deplored thÂ«
fact that in all the discussion, business
considerations â the almighty dollar
seemed to be uppermost.
While it is a popular fallacy to denj
the existence of social classes in this
country, he said. if Is nevertheless In
disputable that well defined classes di
vide our society. The strength of the re
public, he said, rests in the great mid
die class, the manufacturers, jobbers
middle men, commercial travelers anc
business men generally and it would bÂ«
little short of calamity to encourage an>
industrial development that would affect
unfavorably this Important class. Close
to them and another strong element art
the skilled mechanics and artisans.
It was the effect of the trust upon the
classes. Governor Pir.gree maintained,
that should be first considered. As he
viewed the situation, the tendency of thÂ«
trusts was to drive these men into th*
service of the great combinations, where
their identity would be lost and where
they would become mere cogs and little
wheels in a great complicated machine.
Ambition ana perhaps inventive genius
would be deadened and killed, inde
pendence would be lost and a sort of in
dustrial slavery would follow. Commer
cial feudalism, "he said, is the logical out
come of the trust, the trust manager be
coming the feudal baron. Commercial
advantages and -advantages might be
argued, "he said, but it would not be
honest to the people either in this con
ference or in legislative assemblies, il
the effect of the trust upon our national
life <t.rA citizenship be not considered.
Governor Pingree believed it would be
better to be forever poor, but indepen
dent and happy as individuals, than tc
lay the foundations for industrial slaver}
and tyranny- Equality of opportunity tc
all mÂ»-n would be better than the control
of the worid's trade.
"I. favor complete and prompt anni
hilation of the trust." declared Governoi
Pingree, "with due regard for propertj
rights, of course."

RAILROAD DIRECTORS
HONOR THE MEMORY OF
CORNELIUS VANDERBILT
NETV YORK, Sept. 14.â The directors of I
:he nine Vanderbilt railroads met togeth- ,
;r yesterday at the Grand Central station
and adopted appropriate resolutions on
the death of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, Mich

were represented.
J. Pierpont Morgan presided, and resolu
tions drawn up by Chauncey M. Depew,
Marvin Hughitt and D. O. Mills were pre
sented. It was directed that the report be
placed on the records of the several com
panies and that a copy of it be sent to
the family of the deceased. The resolu- .
The structure that will receive the remains of Cornelius Vanderbilt and others of the family that follow him for
a. couple of generations to come stands near the little town of Newdorp, Staten Island. It is just outside of the Mora
vian Cemetery, where stands the family vault in which the "Old Commodore" was laid to rest, and near the farmhouse â¦
In which W. H. Vanderbilt lived and where Cornelius J. and others of his children were born. *>
It was begun in ISB4, and was not quite completed at the time of the death of TV*. H. Vanderbilt. December S, I*vs. 4
It was intended to take the place of the ojd Vanderbilt family vault, which was of scant accommodation and rather in-
secure. It was designed and erected by the celebrated architect. Richard M. Hunt, at a cost of 1900,000. The style of
the tomb is Romanesque throughout, and the whole structure contrasts strongly with the simple vault surmounted by
- mite shaft thirty feet high, which served as a tomb for the founder of the Vanderbilt fortunesâ the only ornamen- <
tation of which is the name VAN DERBILT over the door of the vault. â¢ â¦

DESTROYED CULVERT PIPES.
Dug TJp by Workmen Who Thought
They Were Discarded Sewers.
Tn excavating for the foundation of the
new car tracks on Montgomery street the
it men employed have allowed noth
ing to block their way. At the intersec
."' \tp mery and Bush streets the
excavations were somewhat deeper than
at other points along the line, and ab..ut
feet below the grade of the street a
culvert pipe was uncovered. It led from
the culvert at the Mills building to the
sewer running through Bush street.
As the pipe interfered somewhat with
instruction of the car tracks the
workmen had no hesitation in removing
,:>le of sections and plugging up the
exposed ends with concrete. The excuse
for r-r.dering the culvert pipe useless was
that it was thought to be an old sewer,
and as it was dry the workmen did not
think it was of any use. so they complet
ed the job by destroying it.
The matter would not have attracted
any attention until the rainy season had
not the business men of the vicinity no
ticed what the workmen were doing and
protested, but to no avail.
The attention of the Street Superintend
ent was called to the destruction of the
pipe, and he at once stated that h*
would make a thorough ini-estigation and
would force the Market-street Railway
Company to repair whatever injury U3
workmen had done.
OTA WILL LAND
The Secretary of the Treasury De
cides That He Is Not an
Alien Immigrant.
Deputy Immigration Commissioner
Schell received yesterday a telegram from
Commissioner-General Powderly. indorsed
by Secretary Gage, instructing Captain
Schell to allow S. Ota to land. The tele
gram stated that a letter of explanation
would follow by mail. Ota was rÂ»!<>asÂ»d
at once and took the earliest opportunity
to thank Count Nutsu, the Japanese Con
sul, and W. H. L,. Barnes fur their suc
cessful efforts in having him landed over
the head of the local immigration offi
cers.
Ota has been a merchant in this city for
eight y^ars. He went to Japan last March
to purchase iWO worth of goods for his
store. When he returned about a month
ago he was denied a landing on the
ground that he was an alien immigrant
and afflicted with a disease.
The matter was taken before Judge de
Haven, and he decided that Ota was not
an alien immigrant, that he had acquired
a domicile here and was therefore entitled
to land, but that the court had no Juris
diction to review the act of the Immigra
tion Commissioner. The case was* then
laid before the Secretary of tHe Treasury,
who, after examining the facts, revoked
the action of the local Commissioner.

MADDEN ON HIS DEFENSE.
The Teamster Tells a Plain Story
About His Connection With
Ruby Raymond.
John F. Madden, the teamster for E.
Martin & Co., wholesale liquor dealers,
who was charged with attempting to'
"fix" the case of Ruby Raymond, the
: woman from Sari Jose accused of taking
two girls, Daisy Miller and Nathalie Dan
forth, under Is years of age. to San Jose
I for Immoral purposes, appeared before
: Judge Mogan yesterday.
Madden told a straightforward story.
i He said he had received a letter from a
! friend in San Jose to help the woman in
I securing an attorney to help her. He
I knew Mack, and when Ruby called at his
; house Monday night he went with her to
Mucks office. There she gave him $150 as
: part payment of his fee to defend her.
Nothing was ever said about "fixing" the
! case, and if the defendant said otherwise
she lied.
The Judge asked that the woman should
be placed on the stand, but Mack objected
i to her testifying, as she was a defendant.
The Judge was indignant, and said that
if anybody had tampered with the case
he would punish him and would also
1 take the matter before the Grand Jury.
! He did not like the assertion that any one
could "fix" a case in his court, and he
was determined to sift the -matter to the
bottom. He ordered Madden to be in at
, tendance in his court tiil the case against
j the woman Raymond was disposed of.
; The case will come up this morning.

Prosecuting Attorney Wentworth said
he knew nothing about the facts in the j
case, as he believed that special counsel
bad been engaged to prosecute. He was

peared and Bald that Senator McGowan
bad been engaged to conduct the prosecu
tion, but as he was engaged In one of trte

hundreds of spectators, performing a
somersault in their long descent into the
tank, which was about v eight feet deep.
They were loudly cheered for their dar
ing and clever act.

amateur show and the crowds that filled,
the theater were well rewarded for their
time and patience. One of the chief fea
tures was the fat women's boxing contest
and it afforded the greatest amusement
to the spectators. Adgie and her per
forming lions were also a great attrac
tion.

Murderer, Has Deserted
This City.
The police have been working for the
past few days endeavoring to apprehend
Wong Hlng, the San Jose criminal who
fired three shots at Ah Fong and Ah

TRYING TO CLEAR OFF
THE MERCANTILE`S DEBT
Huntington's Donationâ A Circular
Asking Aid of Subscribers to
; Increase Membership.
The Mercantile Library Association is
rapidly paying off the debt of the library
and expects that the institution will be
on a paying basis in a short time. The
last donation made to the association was
a check for $2000, the gift of C. P. Hunt
ington. With a few more donations of
this amount the entire debt will have be
come liquidated and every dollar received
thereafter will be expended in improving
the library- The association has also
issued a circular to every subscriber re
questing that he use his influence in se
curing two additional members, and in
this manner the Library Association may
become one of the strongest in the West.
C P,Huntington proffered the donation
to President Newhall some time ago and
the money was paid over yesterday. The
following communication was received
from New York directing the treasurer of
the Southern Pacific Company to advance
the amount of the donation:
Southern Pacific Company, Office of the Presi
dent, 23 Broad Street. New York, Septem
ber 8, 1599. . _, Â
Mr N ' T Smith, Treasurer Southern Pacific
Company. San Francisco, Cal.: Dear Sirâ
presentation of this order please pay to Mr.
George A. Newhall. president, or to the treas
urer of the Mercantile Library Association of
San Francisco, J two thousand dollars (J2COO),
and charge to my **Â£"*;Â£"!s&Â£%"
The following circular has been issued
to all members of the association:
Dear Sirâ As a member of the Mercantile
Library Association interested in its welfare.
we ask if it is not possible for you to secure
two new members for the association.
We inclose herewith two blank applications
for membership and a stamped envelope in
which to return the new subscriptions secured.
A concerted effort on the part of the mem
bers should increase our membership from its
present number of 700 to over WOOâ which, with
the contributions now .being received, will
quickly restore the association, with its mag
nificent library of 74,000 volumes, to a most
prosperous condition. â¢
The management will most cordially appre
ciate such consideration on your part. Yours
BinCere GEORGE A. NEWHALL. President.,
The circular is expected to bring forth
excellent results and many members have
signified 'their intention of working ener
getically to realize for the association its
expectations. The life membership will
also be largely increased and ten appli
cations for life certificates have been re
ceived These will be issued as soon as
the number of applications reaches twen
ty-five. The entire debt of the association
originally amounted to $60,000. .of which
about $10 000 has already been secured.
Obed Horr has been appointed assistant
to the president and is making a vigorous
effort 'to reduce the Indebtedness.

THE TRANSVAAL.
THE proposition that our Government offer
mediation between England and the Boers
meets with no official favor. It serves, how
r, to bring the actual relation existing between
. and and that republic into general notice. The
tish Government has artfully concealed the nature
extent ot its suzerainty. By the treaty between
Great Britain and the Transvaal it was arranged that
in all external, international matters England
should be suzerain. This relation came up in the
of the Jameson raid. Several American citizens
were involved in that ambitious venture. They ap
d to our Government for relief, and we at once
referred their cases to Great Britain as the suzerain
â er in all international affairs. We received the
urance that the laws of the Transvaal should be
fairly enforced on the trial of our citizens and that
â¢uld be no denial of justice. The domestic
trnment of the republic proceeded to arraign
try the Americans. They were given every de
fensive advantage found in the local laws, were found
â y and sentenced to death. That sentence could
n executed, regardless of any protest and-in
dependent of any interference by this Government or
Great Britain. President Kruger commuted the death
sentence, and as a substitute a very heavy fine was
imposed and paid, and the men were set free and
rted from the country.
In a still more striking way England asknowledged
the absolute internal independence of the Transvaal
by condemning Rhodes for instigating the Jameson
raid and backing the Uitlanders in their revolutionary
proceedings.
Now, however, England has permitted enlargement
that her treaty rights are not limited to
suzerainty in international matters, but that she has
the power to dictate to the Boers in their internal
jMivernment and to demand that they give to British
subjects a vote and voice in the government of the
republic, without relinquishment of their allegiance
to Great Britain. She possesses no such right, and
were the Transvaal her equal in strength .would be far
from claiming it. Nothing but her superior might is
the motive for the making of a claim so absurdly for
eign to her treaty stipulations. But, no matter to
what extent she exceeds her just powers, we are in no
position to protest or to mediate. We have recently
. appeared in the field of exterior politics. We have
gone beyond our own shores, and have as a precedent
action made certain pledges to the world as to our
purposes. Those pledges in regard to Cuba and the
late possessions of Spain remain unfulfilled, and in
instances have been specifically violated. There is
in this country a vicious and carefully propagated
sentiment in favor of violating them all. England
has from the first ingeniously lured us into this posi
tion, for the reason that before we occupied it we
were the only nation that could forcibly and con
sistently protest to her in favor of the wronged and
the weak. We had no beam in our own eye, and had
the right to see the mote in hers. All this is changed
and our right of challenge of another Government is
subject to its right to offer interference in our own
dealings of a similar nature.
We have ceased to be the one power in the world
which, doing equity, could demand it. The change
that has come in the world's affairs since our change
of front and purpose is very significant and appalling
to the weaker peoples and powers. It has propa
gated the notion that a few strong nations have" the
right to divide the world among them, and that it
shall be divide, 1 , up among the United States, Eng
land, Russia and Germany.
Bonaparte set out to make the Continent all
French, and declared that it was destiny that it should
be French or Cossack. His idea was only a little
more monopolistic than the current cult. It is to be
regretted that we have abandoned our moral position
and that the nations of this hemisphere begin to look
upon us with the same suspicion and aversion that
have been felt against England for generations.
There appears to be now a chance that war between
England and the Boers may be averted, but only by
a surrender to Great Britain in matters that she his
no right to control and by concessions so offensive
that they are only yielded in the face of overwhelming
and destructive force.
And so Edna Wallace Hopper, who. since her di
vorce from the fickle Dc Wolf, is known among her

PHILIPPINE NEWS.
THE statement by Commissioner Schurman, an.d
the interview with General Reeve published |
exclusively in The Call, give some information j
: of genuine value to the American people. Schurman
affirms the advanced civilization of the Filipinos and ,
their industrial capacity. He professes great conli
dence in the people and much sympathy for their as
pirations. His statement presents certain contradic- |
dictions, due to the pressure of his official undertak
ing. He finds great difficulty in the way of their in
dependence because they are not a nation.
When our forefathers revolted against .England
I they were not a nation. The thirteen colonies had lio
1 i tie except a common racial origin. Each existed
1 j under a separate Royal Charter granted by the Sov
-1 ! ereign of England. They united only in the desire
for independence and self-government, and had no !
common civil bond until after the revolution sue- .
ceeded. That bond, in the old Confederation, was j
very slight and did not create a nation. That act was ;
deferred for six years after the treaty of peace. We I
did not establish nationality and a common Federal j
authority without rebellion, resistance and outbreaks, j
and the issues arising in the national interpretation |
of the Federal constitution were not finally settled
until we had fought the most sanguinary civil -war
ever known, seventy-two years after we attempted to
form a more perfect nationality under the constitu
tion. In the light of our own history Professor
Schurman's objection to Philippine nationality be- !
cause it is not a nation now is very considerably j
modified. His ascription to the people of the quali- j
ties of intelligence, fidelity and virtue is an answer j
to the persistent attempt to represent them as unde
serving savages.
General Reeve makes a still more important con- [
tribution to the stock of information on the subject, j
He found the Filipinos enlightened, orderly, indus
i trious and ambitious. They were modest in their as
i piration for self-government and desirous of. the
suzerainty of the United States in their international |
affairs, while in their domestic concerns they desired j
! I independence and self-povernmtnt. He affirms that
â¢ throughout Luzon. Panay, Negros and Cebu the
, native government preserved order and ruled justly
from the time they conquested those islands, a year I
ago last July. His emphatic language on this subject j
should smite the truth into the conscience of those j
editors who are calling them bandits.
The fact appears proved that no conquerors ever
took their victory with more temperance and absten
tion from outrage on private and property rights than
J these Filipinos, to whom, under the laws of nations \
and of war, the sovereignty of the islands passed by
conquest more than a year ago.
General Reeve is emphatic in the opinion that the
present war of conquest was unnecessary. Looking
at the general facts of the situation this opinion is
j justified. We have treated with the Mahometan Sul- j
' tan o-f the Stilus and have paid him a salary to ac
-1 knowledge our sovereignty while we have left the in
! ternal administration of his country untouched. In
( other words, we have agreed that the Mahometan
Stilus are qualified for domestic independence and
self-government. In the case of the millions of
Christians on the islands of Luzon, Panay, Negros j
and Cebu. we by proclamation denied them the same
rights so freely conceded, with a salary on the side,
to the Mahometans. This places us in the attitude
df claiming that centuries of Christianity have di>- ,
qualified the Christian Malays for self-government, ]
while centuries of Itdam have qualified the Mahom- I
i etan Malays for self-government!
Throughout the East the preference given to
i Mahometanism by the United States will have its
j effect. To our mind no more serious blow could be I
struck at the efforts of Christian missionaries in Asia.
Police Surgeon Heintz seems to be a sensitive
plant from the backwoods. He has posted a bulletin
warning reporters away from the Receiving Hospital
operating-room. The suspicion is well grounded that
Heintz fears that his methods are not up to the metro
politan standard.
THE SHAMROCK TRIAL RUNS.
WHILE the Columbia continues to be a strong
favorite in betting circles, the reports that
come from New York concerning the Sham
rock tend to the conclusion that the American yacht
has by no means such a sure thing as one would sup
pose from the reports of the odds offered by her sup-
J. porters.
The results of the trial trips made by the Shamrock
show that she will probably give the Columbia a hard
race in almost any kind of weather, and that with
strong winds she will have a very good chance to win
if she be properly handled. Commenting upon her ap
pearance and performances the New York Sun says:
"This and that about the Shamrock have produced
the impression that she is more of a novelty than her
predecessors, and that the strong hope unquestionablj
cherished by her owner is that the new ideas in her
will work. She carries the greatest of rigs to drive
her in case the air is light, and, it is believed, the
heaviest of weights at the bottom of the deepest of
; keels to hold her sails up to the wind in case it blows.
As an attempt at np all-round boat she outstrips all
for boldness in design."
It is to be noted, moreover, that those who watched
the trials of the challenger speak in admiration of the
skill pf her captain and her crew. It is therefore not
likely we shall be able to profit by any great su
periority in that respect. Taken altogether the con
clusion from the reports must be that the two yachts
are not far from an equality of merit, and that the
reason why such odds are given against the challenger
is that the American is a bolder bettor than the Briton
and is in this instance betting very largely on pa
triotism.
An unclean bird would be a strikingly appropriate
advertising sign for the Oakland undertakers who,
more than once, have fought like human buzzards for

A SIGN OF PROSPERITY.
REPORTS from Chicago are to the effect that
passenger traffic on Western roads centering in
that city has reached a point where it surpasses
the World's Fair records. It is stated that several
times during the past few weeks the stations of
Chicago have received larger crowds of passengers
than on any single day of the great fair, not excepting
those which were made specially attractive by some
conspicuous event of the exposition.
Furthermore, it is stated the large traffic is not due
to excursion or suburban travel, but to the passenger
lists of the regular trains. According to the report:
"Roads like the Grand Trunk are now running their
regular trains in two sections into Chicago. These
trains are running with an nverage of seventy passen
gers to a coach, and some in the aisles in many in
stances. Saturday night at the Polk-street depot, be
tween 8 and n o'clock, over 3000 passengers passed
through the gates. The same crush is visible at the
Union station. The, east and west roads have ajl the

passenger business they can comfortably handle. Be
tween 20.000 and 25,000 passengers a day was
considered a comfortable crowd at the Union station
in 1893, but as many are now being handled, and on
days of special trains the past records are surpassed."
Of course the explanation of this immense. passen
ger travel, whi(jh is noted in other large cities of the
East as well as in Chicago, is the prevailing prosper
ity of the country- The people this year can. afford
to travel. Residents of the cities have had vacations
in the country, and the farmers with their families are
visiting the cities. The crops have been good, prices
are fair, business is booming, and a general spirit of
satisfaction prevails.
There are good reasons for believing the large pas
senger travel to and from the pleasure resorts and
metropolitan centers of the East during the. sum
mer and the fall will be followed by a correspond
ingly large travel westward to California and south
ward to Florida later in the season. The winter re
sorts of the country will be as well patronized as the
summer resorts have been. The outlook for the
tourist trade of the coming season is therefore excel
lent, and it is probable our noted hotels will do a
record-breaking business.
With such prospects ahead it will be worth while
for Californians to be more than usually energetic
in advertising the attractiveness of the various sec
tions of the State. While this is decidedly the best
winter climate in the United States, the State is to
some extent handicapped by its remoteness from the
centers of population in the East and by the lavish
advertising given to the Florida resorts by the big
companies which own the hotels there. It will prob
ably pay us well this winter to make special efforts
to attract tourists. When passenger travel is sur
passing the records of the World's Fair year at
Chicago it is time to turn it in our direction if pos
sible.
An irritable bill collector of San Rafael has indi

r~X IRI'XTORS Gedge and Conlon, members of
; ) the Supply Committee of the Board of Edu
â cation, took occasion at the meeting of the
board on Wednesday evening to deny that there had
been any fraud or corrupt collusion between either of
them and any bidder for the contracts for furnishing
the school supplies.
The denial of Director Conlon was made with the
indefinite fluency of extempore speech, but that of j
Director Gedge was more orderly and formal, being
expressed in a written communication denying that he
had received $2000 for assisting in the award of con
tracts to certain firms which he named, and denying
hlso having had the specifications changed. He sub- |
mitted letters from the firms' named, and also one)
from the secretary of the board, supporting his deniab. j
His communication closed with a request that the I
board investigate the charges. After some consider- |
ation the board decided the investigation could, be j
better made by the Grand Jury, and accordingly a j
resolution' was adopted requesting that body to in- ;
vestigate and pledging the board to offer the Grand !
Jury every facility to get at the truth of the whole \
matter.
The action taken by the board is right. An inves- |
tigation by the board itself would not be satisfactory
to the people. The matter is one that should be in
quired into by the Grand Jury â a body that can
gather information given under oath, that has author- [
ity to bring indictments against the accused parties if
found guilty. Moreover, the Grand Jury is an im
partial body, while the Board of Education is too
closely identified with its own Committee on Sup
plies to be properly fitted for conducting such an ex
amination as is required in this case.
The Call has made it known that Director Gedge
informed at least one reputable citizen that the sum
of $2000 was paid to him for conceding certain advan
tages to a firm of bidders for the contract for fur- [
nishing school supplies, and also that he had given
$800 of the money to Director Conlon, who. accord
ing to the story told by Genge, was a party to the deal.
Such is the evidence now before the public. An
investigation is imperative, but the Board of Educa
tion has done well in referring the matter to the
Grand Jury. That is the right course.
COLOR LINE IN POLITICS.
QNE of the State campaigns now under way
which is of national importance is that in
North Carolina, where an attempt is being
made to bring about the adoption of an amendment
to the constitution which will virtually eliminate the
black vote of the State for the rest of this generation.
The proposed amendment requires an educational
qualification for the right of suffrage, but it exempts
from the requirement all voters who are lineal
descendants of men who were voters in the United
States prior to 1867. The exemption, it will be seen,
includes all white men, but bars negroes. Conse
quently the illiterate white will continue to be a voter
even if the amendment be adopted, but the illiterate
negro will be deprived of suffrage.
The plan is similar to that already adopted ill
Mississippi and South Carolina. It is a part of a
movement which has been spreading throughout the
Southern States, and may yet be adopted by all of
them. It is said the people of Virginia and West
Virginia- and even those of Maryland are giving the
subject much consideration, and success in North
Carolina may lead to the adoption of the plan in
those States.
According to reports from North Carolina it ap
pears the amendment will be carried by a sweeping
majority. Strangely enough a considerable number
of white Republicans are said to be in favor of it", and
one of the ablest of their leaders, Thomas Settle, an
ex-Representative in Congress, is quoted as having
declared it to be "the one and wisest solution of the
most difficult problem now confronting the people
of North Carolina and other Southern States, irre
spective of race or politics."
The matter of national importance in the issue is
the effect such wholesale restriction of suffrage in the
South will have upon the apportionment of Repre
sentatives in Congress after the next census. There
were in 1890 something more than 1,750,000 colored
men of voting age in the United States, and in iÃq6
they were allowed by law to exercise the franchise
everywhere except in Mississippi and South Caro
lina. Since that time Louisiana has adopted a consti
tutional provision which debars most of them in that
State from voting, and now North Carolina seems
about to follow the example.
It is not likely the people of the North will be will
ing to concede to the South representation in Con
gress upon the whole of her population when up
ward of one half of it is excluded from the exercise
of the franchise. The issue will not arise until ths
time comes for apportioning Representatives after the
census of next year, but it will be sure to arise then,
and is being already discussed among far-sighted poli
ticians. â¢

DUMB ANIMALS' FRIENDS.
The Society's Lady Members Pre-

have decided to give an entertainment in
the second week of November. The or
ganizers are all members of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
and their mission is to educate the young

they have been successful Is apparent
from the fact that nearly every pupil in
the public schools is a member of one
of the bands. In order to give a tangible
evidence of membership they concluded
to furnish all who belong to the bands
with a badge. A? these cost money the
entertainment was arranged to ruise
funds, and from appearances it will be a
financial and social success.

and Rabbi Voorsanger. ex-Congressman

Italian who was arrested' for killing fish
in Russian River by the use of dynamite,
was taken to T'kiah. where he pleaded
guilty before a Justice of the ppace. As
the Superior Court was in session he was
taken before that tribunal and again ac
knowledging his guilt was sentenced to
pay a fine of $250 or serve 125 days in the
County Jail. This was the follow who
was assisted in his illegal business by a
large black dog. which retrieved the dead
fish from the water for his master.
Deputy Vogelsang had no little difficulty
in slipping the prisoner away from the
dog at Cloverdale',. the faithful animal
seeming determined to follow his owner
even to prison. If Mecheli is unable to
raise the money to pay the fine it is be
lieved that the "officers "will allow the dog
to share Its master's imprisonment.

PICKED UP THE

Found It Northwest of
Point Reyes.
SHIPPING MEN ARE DELIGHTED
GRAVE MENACE TO NAVIGATION
HAS BEEN REMOVED.

The tig log raft 'hat has been such a
menace to navigation for a week past
la on its way Into port. It was sighted
a.t 4:30 a. m. yesterday thirty miles north
west of Point Reyes in tow of a steamer,
presumably the Czarina. At the hour
named the steamer North Fork was mak
ing her way through the fog from Eure
ka to San Francisco. There was a good
eight-knot breeze blowing and a heavy
swell from the northwest made things
lively. Captain Bash did not see the raft
until those on the steamer towing it burnt
a flare-up. From the general appearance
of the steamer he took her to be the
Czarina, and so reported as soon as he
docked at Mission-street wharf.
The northwest swell was going down
rapidly when the raft was sighted from
the North Fork and incoming vessels re
port that outside yesterday it was almost
a dead calm. In that event the Czarina
and her heavy tow should reach here this
afternoon if all goes well. It will be a
relief to everybody when once the un
wieidly affair is safe in port. The steamer
Walla" Walla, me ship Oriental and the
bark Terris Bj Thompson all had narrow
escapes from running into it.
The.tug Reliance was coaled last night
and went out to assist the Czarina in tow
ing the raft into port. Captain Seaman
of the collier must have done somÂ« lever
work in picking up the hawser of the
raft. There was about sixty fathoms Oi
chain and then about 100 fathoms of a
mar.ila hawser attached to one end or the
structure. In order to secure this a
grappling line had to bÂ« passed under the ,
raft ana towed along until it caught in ;
the towing line. This operation must
have been successfully pertormed by
Captain Seaman and his crew. - Â»-
The transport Belgian King will sail

Another water-front benedict is Andrew
Anderson, chief officer of the steamer
B^-tha. On Wednesday nicht he was
married to Miss Gustava Pedersen. but
many of his friends have not yet learned
of the fact.
The Puget Sound tug Pilot, with the
barge Colorado In tOW, had to put into
Grays Harbor yesterday for coal. The
Pilot left here on the sth inst.. and prob
ably had to face a strong northwest
breeze all the way up the coast. With
an empty barge in tow this was probably
hard work and the coal gave out. The
Colorado carries coal for the Dunsmuirs.

THE BIG LOG RAFT ADRIFT.
CHEF MARKET
INSPECTOR GUIS
IS DISCHARGED
Summarily Removed
by Health Board.
The Board of Health held a special ses
sion behind closed doors last night for.
the purpose of investigating the culpabil
ity or incompetence of Chief Market In
spector William Gans, who testified It the
trial of Jesse Meyers; arrested for killins
Immature calves for sale, that the said
calves, or one of them, was at least a
mouth old. Other witnesses, inci'.ding the
mar. who sold the calves to Meyers, testi
fied at the trial that the calves wVre but
three days old, and on the strength of
their testimony Meyers as convicted.
The action of Gans in the matter had a
suspicious look, inasmuch as he seemed
determined to protect Meyers, who is said
to enjoy h's personal friendship, and vig
orously objected to the action of Dr.
O'Rourke. veterinary to the board, and
Officer John Butterworth, who made the
arrest, declaring that tEBj" wen encroach
ing on his authority. \
After hearing the testimony of
O'Rourke. Butterworth and Assistant
Mark- inspector Barron. the board sent
for Gans to tell his side of the story.
Gans admitted that he had sworn that
the Jersey- calf was a month old. but
sought to save himself by explaining that
he might have been mistaken, as he had
made only a superficial examination of
the condemned veal.
The explanation was not satisfactory",
and for fear that Gar.3 might make other
mistakes of a similar character he was
removed from his position by unanimous
vote. Dr. O'Pourke was directed to per
form the duties of Chief Market Inspec
tor pending the appointment oi a succes
sor to Gans.
The board discussed the necessity of a
new City and County Hospital building
and came to the conclusion that the Su
pervisors should be requested to provide
the money for this purpose, regardless of
the dollar limit or anything else. On mo
tion of Dr. Keeney Dr. Payne was dele
gated to drawMip a communication to the
Board of Supervisors, asking that a cer
tain amount of money be provided for the
construction of new hospital buildings,
and stating that if this were not done
the City and County, Hospital would be
at once condemned and closed.
John A. Hoejr. Inspector of the depen
dent poor at the City and County Alma
house. Â«ent in his resignation, which was
accepted. The place will probably be
tilled a* the next meeting of the board.
C. O. Southard was appointed assistant
chemist to the board, the appointment to
dat" from September S.
Mrs. S. B. Re^d was appointed matron
at the City Receiving Hospital, vice Mrs.
Esmonds, removed.
The salary of Dr. W. F. Rarbat. bac

HUNT'S BULLETS FIND
THEiR SECOND VICTIM
E. R. KNIPPEXBERG DIES SUD
DENLY.
Deceased Did Not Know He Had Been
Shot by the Man Who
Killed Elliot.
The bullet wound sustained by Saloon
keeper E. R. Knippenberg in the shooting
which happened in the Young America
saloon, St^uart and Howard streets, Sat
urday afternoon, proved fatal last even
ing. Knlppenberg was shot by Robert L.
Hunt, an insane teamster, at the same
time that George Billot, another occu
pant cf the -king-house, was killed by
a buliet from the same revolver.
The details of the shooting were
brought out at the in<;uest over the body
of Elliot on Tuesday. Hunt, harboring
some imagined grievance against the El
liot brothers, entered the saloon and
tired three shots. At iirst it was sup
posed that only Elliot had been struck,
and it was not until an hour after the
affair had taken place that Knippenberg
discovered that there was a bullet in his
body. He had been removed to his home
and Dr. Peter A. Kearney summoned.
The physician found that the shot had
entered "his right breast just below the
nipple, but, until the hour of the saloon-'
keeper's death, was unable to locate it.
Knippenberg raliied until yesterday,
wht.-n he had a severe sinking spelll.
Win.- his case was considered serious,
none of his family believed that death
would come as soon as it did. Last even
ing about 4 o'clock he became unconscious
an-1 died five minutes afterward.
Hunt has been charged with the mur
der of Elliot, and upon favorable reports
which reached police headquarters h-i was
simply booked with assault with intent to
kill in the case of Knippenberg. This last
booking will be changed to-day, when an
autopsy on the body will be performed.
Knippenberg was about s*l years of age,
leaves a wife, and was well and favorably
known. He conducted a saloon for some
time and belongs to several prominent
German societies.

FRANEY'S DEATH

The Decision of Judge
Conlan.
F. MXONKELL DISCHARGED
THE JUDGE EXPLAINS WHY THE
CHARGE COULD NOT STAND.
All the Other Defendants Are Also
Discharged and Their Bonds
Are Declared Exon
erated.
In connection with the death of "Jim" !
Frar.ey, the pugilist, resulting from a
boxing contest at Woodwards Pavilion
Ota the night of August 16 with Frank Me- i
Connell. Judge Conlan decided yesterday
that neither McConnell nor any one else
was legally responsible, and dismissed \
the cases.
The Judge held that the contest, as j
shown by the testimony, was fully in ac- I
cordance and compliance with the law. ;
The number of rounds was limited to
twenty and the gloves were of not less '
weight than five ounces. The club was '
also incorporated and had paid the an
nual license. A physician. Dr. Lustig.
m in attendance and examined the two
contestants, finding them in a p*rf â¢*â  t
physical condition, and the club had pro
cured ihe necessary permit from the '
Board of Supervisors for the contest i
FRANK V>. THOMPSON, DOGE OF BfcLVtDnRE CARNIVAL
which was conducted under and subject
to the control of the Chief of Police.
The Judge concluded his decision as fol
lows:
From the testimony a!!. it la clearly
proven that the -â¢â  '-â â â â *â  was Diirety upon a
sparring exhibition baols. Of course, it Is un
fortunate that the young man should have m<*t
his deith in that war, but under the circunv
spectlon and caution exercised by the authori
ties such d<*ath might Just as well have re
sulted in any other athletic sport, such as foot
ball playing, bicycle racing, and so forth.
Then* was a treat deal of doubt whether or
not the death resulted from th* fall or from
the blow, bat In either event the defendant
could not be criminally held for the unfor
tunate occurrence. It was also shown by the
testimony that at the time the deceased was
rendered unconÂ»c!oua neither one of the
contestants could deliver what micht be called
a (fctai blow.
The order of the court was that the de
fendant. McConnell, be discharged and his
bonds exonerated, and the same ruling 1
would apply to the other defendants, Tim
McGrath. Danny Needham. Jerry Sulli

pinos have suddenly become imbued with
American ideas. They want to wear the
clothing of the white man. think that
they are a little out of place living in
their native habitation, and. despite all
the efforts of the fair management, they
Insist upon wandering away from th^ir
Village and taking in the sights. Super
intendent Cumming called a halt last
night, and as a result of the conference
two nt the Filipino hoys will take an in
voluntary trip back to Manila. â¢
Last night a new feature was added to
the fair in the shape of a mandolin- or

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mail advices from New York say: "Prunes
are attract attention at present. ' but there
Is an Impression that the trade may be de
celved by present reports and that the output
may be "larger than anticipated. Considerable
sales are reported, but it cannot be learned
that any of them are coming to this market.
It is a difficult matter to get quotations on
large Quantities. Growers seem In no hurry
to dispose of the.lr crops, the present outlook
appearing unusually favorable, according to
mail advices from the coast The principal de
mand at present is for the large sizes, and
prices on them are held high. The proportion
of large sizes appears to be higher than last
season.
"Apricots are quiet at the moment, though
prices are. held firmly. The bulk of the crop
is out of first hands and Jobbers do not care
to move holdings.
"Peaches are dull and the market weak, with
Scarcely any one willing to make firm offers for
large lots. The supply has been heavily in
creased by the throwing back of green fruit by
canners. Improvement may come later, but few
have any faith in it now.
"Raisins are firm, but trading is small- be
cause of the uncertainty regarding opening
prices. Confidential advices confirm the figures
already published, but add that a premium
may be chared for first shipments. Another
statement is that nothing can be depended upon
until prices are actually given out.
"New crop figs are expected toward the last ,
of this month, and prices are quoted at lli&14c
to arrive. - -
"Other lines are quiet, but are firmly held
in anticipation of improving business this
month."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 14.â greater part of
the Rains In prices which were established yes
terday and durras the early part- of to-day
wore wiped out In the latter part of the day's
trading. A Derlod of almost stagnation suc
ceeded until the announcement of the fixing of
the St. Paul dividend at the regular rate. The
large Felling of grangers Induced by this news
Wai met by supporting orders, which rallied
prices from the lowest. Losses are the rule on
the day, however, which extend to a point In
many active stocks. The rate for money was
nnt listed above the lower level established in
yesterday's relapse, and the reaction in prices
could not be attributed to calling of loans. It
vii- rather due to a reconsideration of the
optimistic view engendered yesterday by the
easing In the money rate and the sentimental
effect of the Treasury Department's decision
to anticipate the payment of October interest
on Government bonds. Yesterday's upward
movement has' been reduced to its true propor
tions of a bear scramble .to cover short con
tracts after having oversold the market In the
rush of heavy liquidation on the preceding
days. Estimates varied widely as to whether
the liquidation proceeded to sufficient- lenghts
to re-enforce the banks against the present and
future demand u;.on their cash resources.
Money continuc-s to move to the interior and the
banks have parted with upward or $4,000,000 to
the Sub-Treasury since last Friday. There was
no evidence to-day of a further urgent con
traction of c red Hi but the outlook for the fu
ture is Dint further liquidation may become
necessary. Foreign houses are reported to have
put put considerable sums in loans yesterday
and to-day, nnd this may account for the com
parative firmness of the foreign exchange mar
ket. Discounts hardened to-day In London and
Berlin in spite of the improved condition re
flected by the Hank of England's weekly state
ment, and London bought stocks moderately In
New York in continuation of the fortnightly
settlement. The failure to increase the St.
Paul dividend Is accepted as an Intimation that
the present prosperous condition of the rail
roads are not so well established but that ample
provision must be made against a recession.
The extreme decline from the early high point
ranged from 1 to 2 points very generally among
the active railroads. *
The grangers and trunk lines were especially
affected. In the specialties movements were
Wider. Brooklyn Transit was under pressure
all day and in the final dealings broke its pre
vious low record on the movement and fell
to IM 4. at which point It closed, 4lÂ«. below yes
terday. Tennessee Coal ranged over 3V4 points
and closed with a net lops of 2.
Sugar, Tobacco, the local municipal stocks,
People'B Gas and the Iron and steel stocks were
all wr-ak before the close. A number of oh
scure stocks showed wider movement than the
average. Pullman, Twin City Rapid Transit,
Mobile and Ohio and Pacific Coast common and
second' preferred . gained between 2\i and 4
points, and Knickerbocker Ice dropped 5V4.
The United States milling: stocks continued
their upward course and gained Hi each. Bonds
were only moderately active. Total sales, par
value, $1,985,000. United States bonds were un
changed In bid auotattons.

Chicago Grain Market.
I CHICAGO, Sept. 14.â Uncertainty in regard j
I to the September wheat situation made wheat ,
rather feverish at the opening, and for a short
! time a really large business was done. Cables
were stronger ."and higher, and this and yes
' terday's bulge In September due to the eleva
tor fight gave a tone of bullishness to trading
that was reflected In slight opening advances
in the deferred futures. The bullishness giad
! ually disappeared when Weare, who was so
prominent in yesterday's September deal, was
seen to have considerable September to sell.
This at once relieved the tension in that re
spect, and the September premium, at one time
%c over December, gradually disappeared al
together. Rumors of private settlements of j
September among big shorts were current, and
that gave rise to the belief that the conges- |
tion had been relieved. The inclination among j
local professionals was apparently to sell, and
support came principally from the outside, 1
most of the commission-houses having buying
orders early; The September tension once re- 1
moved, the market became exceedingly dull, j
New York reported good acceptances of last |
: night's cable offers and the Northwest reported
a good cash demand, but the market in a gen
era! way showed heaviness until the primary
receipts, 1,341,000 bushels, when positive weak
ness developed. December opened a shade high
er at 71%(&71%c. It advanced to 71% C, then
sold down to 'â â¢ 14c, closing at 70%@70%c. Sep
tember opened at 72Â®72%c and declined to 70 7 ic,
closing %c lower at 71% c. Weare was a bid
der for September late in the session, which
caused the rally in that option. Large pur
chases of wheat at Southwestern points ' for
shipment to Chicago were reported.
Corn was irregular and fairly active. A fea
ture was the strength of September, growing
! with recent strength' of September wheat and
! the small stocks of corn, which made shorts
' inclined to get out. Prices advanced sharply
early, but heavy liquidation by longs followed,
nearly all' the advance being lost. The mar
' ket was rather easy late in the session, fol
lowing wheat. December closed a shade lower
j and September He higher.
Oats were very dull. December closed un
! changed from yesterday. . â  .-, ." â .-â ."
The market for provisions was neglected.
j There was some firmness early, but the market
sympathized with the late weakness of wheat .
and corn. Most of the light trading was In
the January product. At the close January
pork and ribs were a shade lower and January
lard unchanged. -

LONDON, Sept. 14.â Two thousand five hun
dred bales of sheepskins were sold at auction
in Mincing Lane to-day. The serectlon was
poor, but there were several fine parcels
which brought good prices. Practically all

higher. Fine erossbreds %Â©*. coarse-^ *?
higher. The home trade was the. best bujer,

PEOPLE WILL
ARRANGE THE
BOND DETAILS
No Secret Plan Has
Been Prepared.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Sept. 14.
H. W. Watkins. president of the West
Oakland Improvement Club, stated at the
meeting" of the Associated. Cluba that it
was ais opinion that the details of the
bond issue are already arranged and that
ill the work being done by the eight im
proved clubs in the association, is use
less.
The '.â â .-- to-lay that Mr.
Watkins Is mistaken. "The details of the
bond issue." said Mr. Snow, "will depend
to- a great degree on what the improve
cnent "clubs and every other progressive
Â»iement in the city recommend. I can say
without fear of contradiction that not a
single detail has yet been decided or even
subjected to any more than, cursory dis
" - r wV"are always credited in Oakland
wt*h "being slow, but the issue of bonds
is certainly one at those things that must
r.ot and shall not if I can heip it, be hur
r<ed through without mature deliberation.
[ do not know at present of any one thing
[ipen which any considerable portion of
the city is agreed, except perhaps the con
struction of an Intercepting sewer along
Che estuary. No one knows what parkd
we want, what wharves we need, or what
3th*r improvements should be undertaken
at this time. Nearly everybody has a
rc-erai idea, but no city can jump at an
framatur* conclusion and vote to put her
-eif into- debt for forty years without
knowing very clearly Just what she is
-
"it" is a grave mistake for any one tn
imagine that any little gang of politicians
or capitalists or any other element is
going to get together and lay down tne
law as to now bonds shall be issued. This
is pre-eminently a matter for the whole
people and 30 io-ng as I am Mayor the
whole peo^Me shall pass upon it and shall
help with their advice the decision of
the details. In a few days the tax levy
will be out of the Council's hand and then
I think it will begin its deliberations upon
this vÂ«Â»ry important bond question."
At the next meeting of the Associated
Clubs the executive committee, which 13
composed of one delegate from each club.
will present a report embodying the ideas
of each club on the bond question, and
the association will, from thi3 data, agree
upon a recommendation, to be made to the
City Council.

THE RAiff FRANCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15. 1899.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
WILL FIGHT
CREATION OF
PLAYGROUNDS
Hoodlums May Use
Them.
Oakland OSes Sar. Francisco Call
3CS Broadway. Sept. 14.
Wliliain T. cfagehora, one of the pio
neer merchants of Oakland, called at the
office cf the Board of Works tins after
noon, and made a very pronounced objec
tion to the scheme of converting a por
tion of Jefferson Park into a children's
playground. Mr. Sagehorn was advised
to make his objection, to the beard in
open session and this he will do.
Jefferson Park is located between Sixth
UXd Seventh. Jefferson and Grove streets.
'Tn that neighborhood," said Mr. Sage
horn, "there are two gangs of hoodlums
and if any inducement be offered them
to gather in. that park they will be flght
tng frcm norcisg till night and till next
rnomir.fr. If these people Interested in
:hildren want to give them a playground
[at them place it where society lives, over
in. Madison Square. or els<i P ut ie cc r " a
Seventh street side of Jefferson Park,
where the noise of the children will be
drowned by that of the Seventh street
local train. All the property owners on
the Sixth street side think as I do. and
we don't want lighting boodlxms or
shouting children continually making' a
noise and giving us trouble at our front
doors. Many times I have had to go out
and step fights with the park as it is. If
it 13 made into a public playground the
gangs will be there all the time and the
park win be ruined as a park."
In the Mayor's office there is now on
display a large blue print prepared by a
landscape gardener to the order of the
Board of Works showing how the south
and east triangles of Jefferson Square can
be converted into a girls' and boys' play
ground at little expense. The pian pro
vided for all the ordinary fittings of play
grounds and the Oakland Club composed
of ladies interested in child culture are
heartily in favor of the public playground.
The club has published its reasons why
It favors the using of a portion of the
park for recreation grounds. In their re
port t3 the following paragraph:
In Oakland we have a ciimats eminently
lÂ£aptc4 to outdoor life, with sunshine three
tounha at the year. It is urged that there la
za necessity for playgrounds for children; that
they a!rÂ«ail7 have too much play; that there
irs dozens of vacant lots open to them. These
ars facts, but net all the facts. The streets
are no's- the common playground; really the
3nly playground for Uttiis children during- the
period oÂ£ strongest character growth. The
{nrrrvtg* at the street !a corrupting. Pla7 ta
be of greatest service should be wisely directed.
Children should be surrounded by <;bjeÂ«:ta that
wtll cultivate the beat and purest ideaia.

PAHTOSKEY IS
ROW SUED FOR
MAINTENANCE
Bride of a Few Months
Charges Cruelty.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 14.
To the many tribulations of aged Her
man Pantoskey., the wealthy Junk-dealer
of lower Broadway, was to-day added â >
sensational suit for maintenance filed by
his wife. Rica Pantoskey.
The parties were married in San Fran- !
cisco on January 23 last, and the affair
created quite a flurry in Hebrew circles. â 
Pantoskey ... a widower, and married
on the advice given him by his first wife
an her death bed. Store then the aged
man's life has. been filled with misery
and saddest regrets.
In the complaint Mrs. Rica Pantcskey
alleges that their matrimonial happiness
was of =hort duration, for "on February j
1 1S3!? \e cursed and reviled plaintiff,
keeping such behavior up until July 6,
when she was compelled to leave her
bomt" The complaint charges Herman.
with imbibing too freely in spirituous
liquors on June 15. and remaining in a j
state of intoxication for several days.
July 4. according to the complaint,
was a particular day for celebration and
general boisterous conduct on the part
of the asr*d junkman, for on the natal
day. recites plaintiit. he "called her a
thief and brnoramus," declaring that "he
was sorry *he married her," asserting
that "he would like to get rid of her.'
Charges are also made that Herman.
"pinched and squeezed plaintifl in. â .-. in
hum.tn manner."
Mrs. Pantoskey avers that she is in
destitute circumstances, while her cruel
husband has considerable property,
money on deposit in banks, and that he
threatens to sell out everything. .She
therefore ask 3 for a restraining order
ar.d JT3 per month for her support, be
sides ccu-csel fvea.
Another interesting suit, resulting from
domestic difficulties, id the long threat
ened divorce suit of the CaMlfo of Fruit
vale which was Sled late this afternoon,
wherein Christopher Cahill charges his
wife. Margaret T. Cahill, with cruelty.
Each had long threatened to sue the
other, and the sensational scene which
occurred in thsir home in Diamond last
Friday night brought matters to a cli
max. At that time Cahiil objected to the
presence of William SLikwitz in his home.
An encounter ensued. ainkwitz was
thrashed, but later, so Cahiil claims,
flourished a gun, and ordered the irate
husband out at the house. Sinkwitz was
arrested, and next day Mrs. Cahill bailed
him out. Thereafter Cahill was arrested
for disturbing the peace of his wife, and
to-day Slnfcwtbs was once more arrested
on a charga of battery preferred by
Cahiii. The trial of the suit promises to
be a very lively one.
Judge Ellsworth to-day granted B. v . J.
Merle" a divorce from Florence R. Merle,
on the ground of willful desertion, and
awarded to him the custody of the three
minor children.
Theresa B. Ufken was granted a di
vorce to-day by Judge Oeden from Johr.
G. Ufken on the ground of cruelty. Thes^
parties were married in Illinois in 1886;
ard for several years resided at Tesla.
The divorce suit of Frank G. Kaiser
against Mary E. Kaiser, brought on the
ground of desertion, was continued this
morning by Judge Ogden. until October
31, far the purpose of giving the plaintiit
further time to collect evidence. It was
stated that when Mrs. Kaiser left the
courtroom to-day 3he was assaulted by a
female friend of the plaintiff, who
slapped her face, but the incident hap
o^n^d so suddenly and was so promptly
hushed that every one concerned feigned
total ignorance on the subject.

advice and warning- to the employes.
After citing his regret for the killing' of

it ia better to incur the ill will oÂ£ a. driver by

In the third ;lace. conductors should use
every precaution to prevent ladles and children
from ailshttnff from the car until it has cotne

HE DODGED "MISTS"
AND THE "UNKNOWN"
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, Ml Broadway, Sept. 14.
ALFRED WILKIE. the well-known tenor, is one of the few men who has
had the pleasure of reading his own obituary. It cornea to him all the
way from Chicago, where many years ago WllkJe was tie organizer of
-he Saturday Night Club. A faw weeks ago Wilkie wa3 reported as be
ing m his deathbed, and half a dozen physicians had declared that he
would not see the sunrise an the following morning. When this bulle
tin was issued, some energetic newspaper men. knowing that Wilkie had a
Chicago musical record, put on the wire the item that the papular tenor
passed into the unknown singing a. aong.
On the strength of this dispatch, a musical critic of the windy city wrote
Wilkie 1 - obituary. It was sent to Mr. Wllkis to-day., and, after reciting
th* facts of his final sickness, It says:
"His soul was full of music and fellowship. OnÂ« at â ': i last survivors of
that old Saturday Night Club is not surprised to hear that the last act of
Alfred Wiikie was a song as the mi3ta gathered about him and he passed
into the unknown."
Mr Wilkie was discharged a few weeks age from a. sanatorium, i- . earr
ing the loss of about twenty pounds of fl^eh, he is a long way from the
"mists" and the "unknown."
MYSTERIOUS ROBBERY
OF A LOT OF JEWELRY
OAKLAND, Sept. 14.â The clever opera
tions cf a mysterious burglar, who a few
2ay3 ago made i rich, haul at the home of
Mrs. C. L. Peregoy, 1027 Chester street.
West Oakland, are puzzling the detectives
who are now investigating- the case* The
articles stolen include a necklace of gold.
an old gold watch valued chiefly as a
keepsake, a Masonic charm, a fob chain,
a diamond iocket and numerous other
trinkets, aggregating a total value of
abont 1300 or $400. A peculiar feature of
the aflair ia the fact that the jewelry was
not all taken at the same time, the dia
mond locket beln? first missed. The next
day the gold watch was missing and later
the other articles. An investigation baa
failed to reveal any evidence of the burg
lar having- forced an entrance to the
house, from which fact the detectives are
led to believe that the smooth worker
may be some ore familiar with the prem
ises and interior of the residence.

SMUGGLING IMMIGRANTS.
Mexican Laborers Imported to Work
on Railroads in Arizona and
California.
Samuel I. Peerry of the United States
Immigration Board at Victoria passed
through this city yesterday on his way
to the Mexican frontier to investigate the
alleged KmiiKfding of Mexican railroad la
borers across the line Into the United
States at points of railroÂ«d construction
between Tncson, Arizona, and Bakers
fteld. Cal. A short time ago Deputy
Immigration Commissioner A. de la
Torre of this city visited the border near
San Diego and found that the smuggling
of Mexican labor into California was go
ing on at a lively rate. He reported the
fact to the Commissioner General at
Washington, and Mr. Perry was detailed
to look into the matter.
COMMISSIONER GWIN RETIRES.
Has Been Asked for His Resignation
to Take Effect on the First.
As foreshadowed In The Call several
months ago, news came from Washing
ton yesterday that Shipping Commissionn
( r "William M. Gwin will be request
ed to hand In his resignation to take
effect on the Ist of October. Mr. Gwin
was appointed by President Cleveland six
years ago, and was afterward placed in
act as moderator. Rev. Dr. Mackenzie will
deliver the sermon. Rev. Mr. Carson will
charge the pastor and Rev. Dr. Hemphlll
will charge the people.
Rev. Mr. Thomas is quite young, but he
has already occupied several pastorates.
He is a graduate of Lawrence University,
Wisconsin, and Lane Seminary, Cincin
nati. He was first a pastor at Jackson,
Ohio, and then occupied the pulpit in the
Fifth Presbyterian Church in Cincinnati,
where he remained three years. Then he
was pastor of the Bethlehem Presbyterian
Church in Minneapolis. He comes to San
Francisco from Minneapolis.
the civil service, but President McKin
ley's proclamation of last May took the
position out ,of the civil service and left it
open. Charles W. Bassett will be appoint
ed to the vacancy. He has been fee
ommrinl.il by the California delegation.
The clerks in the office are protected by

THEATER WAR TAX.
Special Agent Thomas Will Procure
the Rearrest of Lessee McDonald
of the Alhambra.
Internal Revenue Agent Bert M.
Thomas is not satisfied with the decision
of United States Commissioner Heacock
in the theater war tax case. In which
Henry McDonald of the Alhambra Thea
ter was the defendant. McDonald was
lessee of the theater and was arrested
for refusing to pay the war tax of $100
per year.
His attorney contended that the pro
prietor of the theater building should pay
the tax and not the lessee. judge
Heacock decided tbat McDonald"s at
torney was right.
Mr. Thomas says that If the derision
stands it will lose A large sum of money
to the United States, and that all over
the country the lessees and not the pro
prietor is made to pay the tax. Mr.
Thomas proposes to file an information
against McDonald and throw the contro
versy Into the United States courts for
decision.
The men of Chicago spend $3,500,000 a
year for shaves.

APOLITICAL soason remarkable for

what by the announcement that

will be called to order again dur-
Ing the last week of this month.
The Republicans may not proceed at once
to the real business of nominating a mu

would cause no surprise.
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the Dem

delegates of that body Tuesday evening,
September 2C. He will then announce the
names of forty men to be added to the
peventy-two already Belected by the va
rious delegations to serve on the county
committee-. Mr. McDonald remarked yes
terday that the delegates would then go
right along -with the work of nominating
a ticket. Gavin. McXab and Jasper Mc-
Donald, as representatives of the Com
mittee of One Hundred, are not holding
the convention with a loose rein. The pro
gramme which they have practically de
cided to Bubmlt will be accepted by the
convention. A delegate whose sympathies
are with the controlling faction makes

Mayor, James D. Phelan; Assessor,
"Washington Dodge; District Attorney, L.

f plrants for the office of District Attorney
j are Senator Porter Ashe, Walter Strad-
I ley, Wesley Reed, Thomas F. Barry, Eu
gene Deuprey and Robert Ferral.
Porter Ashe is popular, but he could
! not serve as District Attorney without
rfsiprning tho Senatorship. The district
whirh he represents is Republican and
| his successor will be a Republican. It is
not possible for the -Republicans to find
another candidate for Senator as
objectionable as the' one defeated
â¢by Mr. Ashe. The Democrats, ap
; preciaiing the fact, art not ready to
' lose a seat in the Senate. Y.et very many
| of them would be delegated to support
! Senator Ashe for District Attorney if the
party did not need his service In the
upper house of the Legislature.
Ihe Sheriff's oflice is an alluring prize.
|It tempts the aspirations of Thomas
; Burke, Colonel O'OAnnor, William J.
I Biggy, Richard I. Whelan, J. P. Dockery,
! Jeremiah Deasy and many others.
For County Clerk Fred Balto-tn.
! Michael Haley and John A. Browrr are
candidates for the convention's favor.
| Leaders of the City Republican Leaerue
I and members of the executive committee
will meet at the headquarters of the
organization. Grand Hotel, at 9 a. m.,
Saturday. The forenoon hour was ap
pointed to suit the convenience of Henry
T. Scott, Zenas U. Dodge and others.
The time for holding another session of
the nominating convention will be fixed
at the morning conference. The present
plan is to convene the delegates on the
evening of September 26, but the leaders
may decide to extend the recess one
week.
The Republican leaders are still sur
veying the field to find the most accept
able candidate for Mayor. John A. Rus
sell, clerk of the Board of Supervisors,
is mentioned as one on the list of the
acceptable, but this mention does not
signify that his name heads the list
Horace Davis still maintains a place
near the head of the column.

7th inst. he found J. D. White, Frank
Winter and C. L. Toyer at the net. which
he was watching, and arrested them on
the spot. The three were taken to Tracy
where, acting upon the advice of the
Justice of the Peace, he carried them on
to Stockton for trial. Toyer was dis
- missed by the Stockton magistral
he immediately demanded that the assist
ant District Attorney issue a warrant for
the arrest of the CommiPsion. rs' officer
for false and illegal imprisonment. This
the assistant refused to do.
Kercheval states that his acts were
proper, being advised to do as he did by
the Justice at Tracy, who did not want
! to handle the case a." the jail at that place
| nad been burned down. In regard to the
j imprisonment of Toyer, he says that
I under tne circumstances that it "was the
only thing he could do. In fact, he sub

and the latter stated that there was
ample evidence to hold him. Mr. Kerche

NEWS OF CAMP, FIELD AND TRANSPORT
TROOPS WILL
PARADE ALONG
THE BAY SNORE
Line Will Form at
Eleven O'Clock.
The great question for discussion at the
Presidio yesterday was the big- parade.
It. has been decided to form the troops
at the foot of the old parade plain, their
right resting on the bay and the line ex
tending up toward the volunteers. This
will bring them facing west. The various
commands have been ordered to be ready
to form at 11 o'clock, and there will be no
delay.
The order requires "undress" uniform,
and this phrase has set commanding offi
| cers talking. Just what undress uniform
Is Is a little uncertain just at present.
It may mean leggins and campaign hats,
or it may mean no leggins and fatigue
| caps; or it may even allow 'the dress the
I volunteer regiments have been wearing
1 very much of lateâ campaign hats, leg
gins, blue trousers, no blousts and a dark
blue shirt, set off sometimes with a red
' necktie. â¢
The Twenty-sixth Infantry will be the
! next to arrive at the Presidio. It was
recruited in the far East and rendezvoused
at Plattsburg barracKs, New York. It is
commanded by Colonel Edward Rice.
The regiment has been some days on the
way out here, but if nothing happens it
should reach here to-day or early to
morrow. Whether or not it will go into
camp here is a question, for unless the
seven remaining companies of the Thirty
fourth get away before it arrives, the
; Twenty-*lxth, or part of It, will have to
<go into temporary quarters in the de-
I tention camp on Angel Island. No troops
I have been sent there yet, for the camp
; was established for any volunteer regi
ment returning, from the Philippines thai
might be put under quarantine
The Belgian King, the transport to
which the remaining companies of the
Thirty-fourth have been assigned, is
booked to sail to-day. If she can get
away the Thirty-fourth will be out Just
in time to make room. There will be
another regiment ' In, the Thirty-third
from San Antonio, Texas, about Septem
ber Â£0, and the Thirty-third will <b e in
danger of banishment to Angel Island if
â  there is any delay in the leaving of the
Thirty-first, booked to sail on the Grant
;on September 18. No westbound regi
ment has so far arrived from the East
i on time, however, so the coast will very
probably be clear when the Thirty-third
I arrives.

MISS LIZZIE PRUE IS
RAPIDLY RECOVERING
SHE HAS BEEN REMOVED TO DR.
LANE'S HOSPITAL.
Yellow Journalism Is Seeking to
Make Capital Out of the Un
fortunate Girl's Attempt
on Her Life.
Miss Lizzie Prue. the young lowa girl
who attempted to commit suicide In the
Grand Hotel Tuesday night and again
"Wednesday morning, is now well, on the
road to recovery. Wednesday night she
had several attacks of heart failure, but
Dr. Robinson never relaxed his" care for
an instant and yesterday morning he was
able to say she was out of danger. Dur
ing the day her brother telegraphed to the
manager of the Grand Hotel to send her
home at once, but the doctor recom
mended a rent of a few days before send
ing her on the long journey.
Miss Denny, who became acquainted
with Mips Prue in the Grand Hotel re
mained with her friend all night and all
of yesterday. She offered to take the un
fortunate girl to Benicia, but the yellow
Journal came on the scene and for ad
vertising purposes had her removed to
Lane's Hospital.
There is really nothing more to be done
for Miss Pnle, as all she wants is a good
rest. To Dr. Robinson belongs all the
credit of bringing her back to life. From
11 a. m. Wednesday until 6 a. m. Thurs
day he was in constant attendance upon
Miss Prue and had it not been for his
skill she would undoubtedly have died.
The would-be Filicide was in a much
healthier frame of mind yesterday. She
now wants to live and is sorry she tried
to kill herself. Miss Denny is 'still of the
opinion that she was out of her mind
when she took the poison and Miss Prue
says she remembers nothing but an over
whelming desire to die. After spending a
few days in the hospital she is going back
to her home in Waverly, lowa.

I It was an informal affair, and a most
enjoyable one. The ladies of the two
companies were all present, and they saw
that no soldier was neglected. The offi
cers of both companies spoke, and several
of the men lent their aid in an impromptu
programme.
Acting Assistant Surgeon John
Sturgeon Hill has been assigned to duty
at the general hospital at the Presidio.

TEACHERS SEEK TO HAVE
SCHOOL FUNDS INCREASED
ENCOURAGED BY SUPERVISOR
HOLLAND'S ATTITUDE.
Secretary Simpson of the Board of
Education Issues a Call for a
Meeting.
Secretary J. A. Simpson of the Board of
Education yesterday sent the following
notification to principals and teachers of
the public schools:
You are hereby notified that the Board of
Kducation has authorized that the pupils be
dismissed and the schools closed Friday after
| noon, September 15, lMÂ»a, and that a meeting
â  of the principals and teachers of this depart
ment be held in the auditorium of the MiHslon
High School, corner of Eighteenth and Dolorea
streets, at 1:80 o'clock p. in., Friday, Septem
ber 15, 1899. Question of school funds. Attend
ance Is requested.
The object of the meeting is to urge
upon the Supervisors the necessity of in
creasing the appropriation of the School
Department. It is understood that the
pedagogues are desirous of having $6000 a
month added to the appropriation as al
ready fixed. They are very much encour
aged at Supervisor Holland's attitude, in
the matter. His intention to submit
amendments increasing certain appropria
tions, as published exclusively in yester
day's Call, includes $70,(M> additional for
the public schools, and this is practically
the amount sought for by the teachers.
Supervisor Aigeltinger, when seen yes
terday, stated that he will stand by the
figures as presented by his colleague, and
his support may he counted upon. A me
morial will be addressed to the Supervis
ors expressing the wish of the teachers
on the subject before next Monday's
meeting, when the lax levy must be posi
tively fixed.
Orphanag-e Reception.
The managers of the Maria Kip Orphan
age will receive their friends next Sat
urday afternoon, September 16, between
the hours of 2 ami 5, at the orphanage,
520 Lake street, corner of Seventh ave
nue. The children have arranged a short
programme to amuse their visitors and
will also nerve light refreshments. All
persons interested in this most worthy
charity for girls are invited to be present.
The South Dakota band has most gener
ously donated its services for the enter
tainment. Miss Shipley will give some
very fine selections on the cornet.
TARTAR GIVEN
HER CLEARANCE
Allowed to Sail From
Hongkong.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
iÂ»AoxjimunjiX| nepi. i*. â Clearance pa
pers have been allowed the Tartar â¢ at
Hongkong. It is expected that she
will proceed to the United States at once.
The Information that clearance had been
allowed came in a dispatch to Adjutant-
General Corbln this morning from Colonel
Metcalf, commanding the. Twentieth Kan
sas, and the troops aboard the trans
port.
It is supposed clearance papers were al
lowed upon the suggestion of the British
Foreign Office to the British Governor at
Hongkong that it would be unwise to In
terfere with American transports. An
other dispatch from Colonel Metcalf in
reply to one sent yesterday states that
the Tartar was no more overcrowded and
that the food was as good as on other
transports leaving Manila. He said that
the trouble arose among the discharged
regular soldiers who were returning home
on board the ship.

At Tempel Emanu-El Rabbi Yoorsanger
; urged the Jews to be loyal to their relig
ion. "I tell you it is high time," said
Rabbi Voorsanger, "that you should un
derstand that the religion of Israel is not
merely a religion of an idol before which
to kneel once a year. It is not the relig
ion of gratitude to express when God has
been good to you. It is the religion of
the virtuous man, of the virtuous woman,
who understand that all life, from its be
ginning to its ending, should be the ex
pression of God in man. It is the religion
of conduct. It is next a question of loy
alty, and next of self-respect."
Rabbi Voorsanger denned loyalty as "a
virtue that does much to improve the re
lations between man and man and the
agencies for the interpretations of God's
law." "The higher virtue of our lives
is loyalty to the parent who â¢ gave us
birth. God pity the man who has not loy
alty for his mother, for his flag and for
his religion. As the mother suggests
protection and love, so does the flag sug
gest protection from worldly danger*; and
religion- suggests the undying hope of the
soul. The sacrifice of loyalty is, at the
same time, the sacrifice of self-resp-.ct.
I do not mean, by loyalty to religion, sim
ply attending the synagogue. 1 mean a
loyalty of heart and of affections; a loy
alty that will come from the sentiment
within us that we will stand by our cause,
no matter what happens, and never let
it go under."
The speaker also urged self-respect. A
man who did not respect his religion does
not respect himself. He had much to
learn who had too little self-respect. A
people who had not self-respect would be I
judged harshly by the world. The cause
was lost that was not founded upon per
sonal conduct, loyalty and communal and
personal self-respect. Cantor Stark and '
Organist Sabin conducted the musical ex
ercises. An orchestra took part .in the
memorial services.
At Sherith-Israel Synagogue Rev. Dr.
Nieto compared the Jews of two periods,,
the Jew of ancient history and the Jew
of the present day. When the barriers
were rent and the Jew of olden times was
liberated the world ceased to molest him
in the practice and observance of his
religion. His hand was taken by his
brother man and he was recognized.
When the ghetto fell what was to be
come of the Jew? He had a difficult task,
for he knew only his own language; he
had to make his way; yet all the facili
ties for success were dented to him. How
could the Jew progress?
He has been brave; he has been true
to religion. Dr. Nieto wished to deny
that the Jew had been either cowardly or
Irreligious. The charge of cowardice upon
the Jew of history was based upon a mis
taken conception of hifmility. The charge
that the Jew would not fight for his
country had been proved to be false. In
Russia he had joined a service that had
given him no honors and has left his
family degraded. Germany was served
by the Jew, but no honors were given him
in return. In France a Jew was not ac
corded his rights. No wonder that he did
not care to serve in the army or navy
of France. But in England and America
the Jew, being accorded his rights, had
proved to be as brave as a Hon. In San
Francisco there were at the time of
speaking 300 Jewish soldiers who were
wearing the uniform of the United States.
and of Samar are praying for the speedy
arrival of the Americans and will wel

It is said that as a result of the forcible
collection of taxes by the emissaries of
the insurgents, who take all they have
got, the natives are in a state of semi
dtarvation. They have no faith in the
Tagalos and they earnestly desire Ameri
can protection.
An insurgent leader, General Luzban,
has bolted to Japan, taking with him
$2firto collected by him for the insurgents.
The agents of the insurgents endeavor to
force the natives to join their forces,
which they will not do. The condition in
the island, it is asserted, is rapidly ap
proaching riot and anarchy, as the heavy
and continued drag upon them in the
form of tribute exasperates them, and
they, the letter says, threaten desperate
disturbance If it continues.

Cantor Davis conducted the music of the
service with an augmented choir.
Rabbi Levy preached at the Geary
street Temple morning and afternoon.
During the afternoon service he asked
his hearers to consider whether they had
passed through the day of atonement in
the proper spirit. Fasting and prayer
were unavailing unless the heart hart
been purified. Had the whole day found
his congregation in a contrite spirit:
Had they taken the attitude of the dying
man who said: "I have sinned, I have
transgressed, I have gone astray . He
urged upon all hearers that they should
harbor the proper spirit that would make
the season of real benefit to their fellow
men and to themselves. At the forenoon
service Rabbi Levy made allusions to the
dead and to the duty of living. Rev J.
Rabinowitz was the cantor. The choir
consisted of eight.
Rabbi Isador Myers of Congregation
Ohabai Shalome. took for his two topics
for the day "Paradise Lost" and "Para
dise Regained," discussing the first-named
at the morning service and the latter in
the afternoon. The Biblical story of the
Kin in the Garden of Eden and the ex
pulsion of Adam and Eve from the
garden was reviewed. God asked the
same Question in modern times that he
a skrd of Adam: "Where art thou?
Awakened conscience led to atonement.
Discussing the Day of Atonement the
rabbi said that it was a means to bring
man back to a state of happiness. It en
abled him to make his peace with God.
The children of Israel returned like doves
to their religion. To be like the dove
they must be humble and gentle. Man
can best find comfort in religion. D. Mey
erson was the cantor. The choir con
tained eight volunteer singers.
Services were held at B'nai B nth Hall
by Rabbi Abraham of the Septorlm con
gregation, composed of orthodox Jews
from the Orient. The services at NeVah
Zedek 943 Mission street, were conducted
by Rev. Mr. Rosenbaum. Jewish soldiers
were in attendance at all the synagogues.

The gasoline launch which had brought
him moved a,way, and not wishing to take
the responsibility of throwing him, over
hoard to the sharks, the officials' were
obliged to allow him to remain.
General Reeve, in explanation of his
act, said that he had not been warned
not to go on board the Sheridan, and that
he was not aware that he was violating
any law or regulation. Tho Minnesota
boys were so glad to see him, he said,
that they pulled him over the rail and
forced him to remain on board all night
against his will.
1 "nited States Attorney Coombs, to
whom the matter was referred, was
making an investigation.

GRAVE CHARGES OF
CORRUPTION IN MANILA
Former Clerk TTndÂ«r Auditor of Pub

DENVER, Colo., Sept. 14.â Napoleon E.
Guyot, late private of Company G, First
Colorado Volunteers, who during the last
three months of 1898 served as clerk un
der Major Kilbourn. and later under
Lieutenant Colonel Potter, auditor of pub
lic accounts. Manila, publishes this even
ing a signed statement in which the
gravest charges of corruption are made
against the American officials in Manila.
He says an examination of the vouchers
forwarded to Washington will show that
exorbitant prices are paid for all kinds
of supplies purchased in Manila- that
vast quantities of high-class wines and
other supplies have been purchased os
tensibly for the Spanish hospitals, while
in the American hospitals only the coars
est supplies are furnished. He says
courts-martial of private soldiers charged
with selling Government property have
been stopped because they would result
In the exposure of official "rascality. The
robberies, he asserts, will aggregate ah
enormous sum.

Cantor Stark composed the music for
