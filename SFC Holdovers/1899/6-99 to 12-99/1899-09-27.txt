DECLARES ADMIRAL GEORGE DEWEY
After an Absence of Twenty-Three Months
the Hero of Manila Bay Fervently
Expresses Pleasure Upon Returning,
Talks About the Philippines and
Seems to Dread the Great Welcome
That Has Been Prepared for Him.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â Out of the
mist and fog that hung over the
sea beyond Sandy Hook at peep
o' day this morning emerged
the Olympia, with Admiral
George Dewey on board. The Olympia
â was weather-stained but stanch, after
her long run horne â and ' tWo days
ahead of â and Dewey, hearty,
bronzed, modest, ready to receive the
plaudits of his countrymen, but des
tined before the day ended to be utterly
'dumfounded when ho learned the mag
nitude of the welcome that awaited
him.
His flagship slipped around Sandy
Hook, and it was by the merest chance
that the little garrison at Fort Han
cock got in an admiral's salute of
seventeen guns before the oiympia
came to anchor in the lower bay. The
Olympia had come at a steady pace of
10 knots an hour, using one screw, for
a. blade of the other had been damaged
In coming through the Suez canal, and
she made no stop anywhere. Her voy
age was made in perfect weather, and
the admiral caught the first glimpse
of his native land early on Monday
night. Then the Olympia stood off
shore until daybreak when she came
in, catching almost everybody napping
except the ship news watcher in Sandy
Hook lookout.
Hardly had her anchor struck bottom
before, the word was passed to this
city and hence all over the country
that Admiral Dewey had arrived.
The gray mist of dawn had hardly
been dispelled before pleasure boats
began sailing about the cruiser and
shouts of welcome arose. A storm of
cheers floated over the water from the
fleet of excursion craft when the ad
miral was recognized. At sight of each
new American flag- the admiral lifted
his cap and bowed. Time and again he
turned to some officers of the Olympia
(standing by his side and said. "Thank
God, I am home again."
When her anchor rattled to the bot
tom and the Olympia swung at her
moorings the admiral stepped out on
the quarterdeck. The sun had not
long, been started on its climb up th"
heavens. The admiral bared his head
and took in a long breath, then .he
pi.id: "I am glad to get back."
Not at that moment nor at any time
later in the day when official visits
were showered on him, did he speak of
the emotion he felt at â¢ his changed
position. Here stood the man for whom
all Americans were waiting the one
creat hero of the war. the individual
The San Francisco Call.
toward â¢ whom the whole heart of his
country went out in good-fellowship.
He/had' come home to receive a wel
come the like -of which has never been
tendered to a living American, yet, less
than two years before he had gone
abroad, a commodore, it is true, but
comparatively unknown outside of his
profession of arms, and outside of his
native. State. He has returned to find
his name on everybody's lips and. his
picture. in . everybody's window, and
everybody speculating, some, vaguely
and some with keen desire, whether, it
would not be well to make George
Dewey President.
The admiral had not expected the re
ception committee until to-morrow. He
had telegraphed the Mayor that he
would be at ; Tomkinsville to-morrow.
But the gentlemen who are running the
reception feared that Governor Roose
velt might call before the committee,
so they acted precipitately. These var
ious calls and Interviews gave an in-
Bight at close range into the character
of the country's greatest hero. In the
first place, everybody will be interested
in knowing what Admiral Dewey thinks
of himself as a Presidential candidate.
He merely laughs. He declines to en
tertain the thought of running for po
litical office. . â¢
When told that his relatives said that
he was a Republican, he said they
knew no more about his politics than
a stick. When a wag informed him
that there was talk of running him for
President, with General Joe Wheeler
for Vice President, he observed that he
and Wheeler would make a pretty mess
of it, "for he would try to run the
country like a ship and Wheeler would
try to run it like a regiment." The ad- |
miral had no criticism of the conduct i
of affairs in the Philippines. His re- j
marks were very guarded, but he reit- :
erated^ his .,. well-known saying. "Fill- â 
pinos are as capable of self-government
as the Cubans," adding that he did not
think the Filipinos were ready for self
government just yet.
Admiral Dewey appears keen, alert,
eager in voice and action, and appar
ently in perfect physical condition. He
said he felt well. He told the commit
tee on reception that he was all right
if he could stand the strain of the re- i
ception awaiting him. Then he ex
plained that at Naples he bad accepted
one dinner invitation, and as a result i
had to accept four others, in conse- |
quence of which he was sick for a week.
His officers do not believe that the
strain he will have to undergo will im
pair his health in the least, and they

think be wH] come out of it as fresh
as he is when he goes in. The admiral
is not guing to sleep ashore until the
heavy part of the reception is over.
When h..- u;ip invited to spend Friday
night at the Waldorf, he said no, he
Would return to his ship, and would be
up in plenty of time to place himself
at the disposal of the committee for
the cup presentation at the City Hall
at 9 o'clock Saturday morning.
It waf not until he talked with naval
callers that the magnitude of the re
ception waiting him began to dawn on
Admiral Dewey. He declared that he
felt immense pride and gratification in
the reception, but it almost confused
him to see what his countrymen were
doing. In all his conversation, in every
tone, every detail of manner, every
movement, the admiral typified the
character which the American people
have given him. All his callers united
in saying that he is modest to a degree
when speaking of his own work. In
deed, he never referred to it by sug
gestion or even by indirection, but he
was enthusiastic and buoyant with
pride when he spoke not only of his
own officers and men, but of the whole
service.
Admiral Dewey is a humorist. He
had to smile when the chairman of the
reception committee, with great unc
tion, detailed how the admiral was to
ride with the Mayor in a carriage
"drawn by four bay horses," and when
he was called upon to explain how he
happened to be two days ahead of time
he remarked that he had made it a
custom in life to be a day or two
ahead rather than an hour behind time,
"because, you see," he said, "I come
from Vermont, and that is a State
where we have to scratch gravel."
The admiral also declared that his
pictures made him look older than he
really was. At the same time he re
marked, "I think I am getting old. The
fact is I started in to be a hero too
late in life. I should have begun
younger."
Admiral Dewey found time yesterday
to receive the newspaper men with
great cordiality. He also found time
to receive a call from Sir Thomas Lip
ton, which he was to return later in the
day. He was scrupulous about doffing
his hat every time one of the Sandy
Hook boats took a cheering crowd of
commuters past. He took everything
in a very matter-of-fact way, and
seemed to be supremely happy to be
back in his native land once more.

TO GET HOME

pared by Ameri
can People.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â Admiral
George Dewey arrived off New York
at dawn, and the Olympia is now
anchored in American waters in the
light cf Sandy Hook.
The first shout of welcome was from
, the pilots a.nd crew of pilot boat No. 7,
j fifteen miles south of the Hook light
: ship. It happened to be Pilot John
Peterson's turn and at 5:50 a. m. he
was put on board the Olympia and
â  brought her around the Hook and into
I the lower bay. The marine observers
j along the coast had sighted the Olym
| pia in the first light of the morning.
I The shore batteries of Fort Hancock,
manned by gunners called from break
fast, let loose seventeen guns. The
flagship replied with twenty-one and
let go her anchors not far from where
the cup challenger Shamrock is moored.
The admiral was in his own country
again, after twenty-three months' ab
sence. He had returned "great with
the arduous greatness of things done,"
and he scarcely seemed to realize it.
The pilot had brought aboard the Sun
day papers and a reporter of the Asso
ciated Press was received by the ad
miral in a cabin littered by the illus
trated Dewey editions, which together
made hundreds of pages in black and
white and in colors, all concerning the
great admiral and the preparations to
receive him.
"It almost saddens me," said he, "to
see what my people are doing for me.
The pride and gratification is immense
and I cannot express the appreciation
I feel. I did not know, I did not really
perceive until this morning the splendid
welcome that my countrymen are giv

are coming to see me and troops from
GREAT JOY IN THE OLD
GREEN MOUNTAIN STATE
NEW YORK. Sept. 26. â In many places throughout the country guns were started booming, bells ringing
and whistles screaming early this morning by the announcement of the safe arrival here of Admiral Dewey. ,
New York City was not the only Joyously noisy place. Other cities far and near celebrated, each in its own j
fashion.
Taken by surprise, the residents of Montpelier, Vt., only worked the harder in preparation for the recep
tion of their most distinguished citizen. The news reached there early, and was greeted with the firing of can
"non, fireworks and unlimited cheering. The citizens term the Olympiads early arrival "another Dewey surprise."
At Norwich University at Northfleld, Vt., where the admiral was once a student, the receipt of the news }
was a signal for a demonstration, in which all the bells and whistles of the town were used, while cannon on >
the university grounds gave the admiral's salute. A meeting will be held at Northfleld to make arrangements j
for receiving the admiral on October 13, when the cornerstone of Dewey Hall is to be laid. 5
In Philadelphia Mayor Ashbridge ordered the ringing of the bell in the tower of historic Independence Hall. J
Seventeen strokes, an admiral's salute, were tolled.
The booming of cannon broke the morning stillness of Princeton, N. J. Whistles, pistols, guns, firecrackers
and other noise-making devices joined, until nothing could be heard but a medley of reverberating sounds. ,
The townspeople turned out in alarm, but the university students told them that Dewey was home. The admiral j
is dear to the hearts of the sons of old Nassau, not only because of his deeds, but because his son is a gradu- j
ate of Princeton and a loyal alumnus. '
The firemen of Belleview, N. J., were scared by the blowing of a whistle in a big factory. They had been
warned that it would be blown when Dewey arrived, but it was so unexpected the flre-fighters hurried out the
apparatus and raced to the factory. When they learned of their mistake the men rushed back and set the
engine-house bell in motion.
Newark, Morrietown. Jersey City and other places throughout New Jersey celebrated with demonstra- ,
tions of most enthusiastic kind.

The admiral stroked the head of a
tawny-haired dog. the crow dog of a
Chinese breed that appears in the il
lustrated interviews with the admiral.
"Bob. here." he said, "is not well.
He yearns to be ashore. He is sick to
get a little grass and to scamper
around. I feel a good deal that way
myself. I am mighty glad to get home.
It is not good for a man any more than
a dog to live on shipboard for twenty
three months."
Alluding to his arrival two days
ahead of time he said: "I am sorry
that I am ahead of schedule. The
Olympia has been steaming at the uni
form rate of ten knots an hour since'
we left Gibraltar. Several days ago
we knew that we would arrive before
Thursday unless we moderated our
speed or went somewhere out of our
course. Captain Lamberton. Lieuten
ant Brumby and I held a consultation.
The propriety of running into Hampton
Roads or some other port in the South
was spoken of, but we concluded that
we ought not to touch land first any
where except at New York. It was
suggested that we cruise some distance
outside New York harbor until Thurs
day, but we knew that if we did we
would be disco% - ered and reported. The
weather looked a little squally, and it
seemed better to be inside the Hook
than outside. But the consideration
that really decided us to come into
port was to give Captain Lamberton a
chance to clean un the ship before our
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
voyage up the harbor. Captain Lam
berton and I are very proud of the
Olympia and we wanted enough time at
our anchorage to rub her down and to
make her look spick and span."
The Olympia looks as smart now as
a yacht. The anchors were hardly
down before details of the crew were
washing the ship's white sides and
touching up the stains with paint.
The admiral's first business was to
send an officer ashore with telegrams
for the Navy Department, Mayor Van
Wyck and General Butterfleld. announ
cing the arrival. He then spent most
of the morning in looking over news
papers and receiving reporters. He
was just finishing a midday breakfast
when Sir Thomas Lipton called on
him. With Sir Thomas were Dr.
Mackay and other visiting Englishmen.
"I suppose you have come for the
' tea." said Admiral Dewey, referring to
| Sir Thomas' gift of five pounds of tea
to each man on the ship while at Co
lombo.
"No; you're welcome to that if any
body can drink it," replied Sir
Thomas.
The admiral and the owner of the cup
challenger had a fifteen-minute talk.
As Sir Thomas and his friends left th<;
Olympia a half hundred of the ship s
crew forward cheered the Baronet.
"You could not stop "em," cried out
Admiral Dewey, waving his hand at
Sir Thomas Lipton. "They had not
any orders to do that."
Admiral Dewey then had a succes
sion of notable callers. Rear Admiral

patch boat was a mile away it began
firing an admiral's salute and the
Olyinpia replied with a rear admiral's
salute of thirteen gun?. The Dolphin
anchored near the Olympia and Rear
Admiral Sampson and his staff went
Ã¼buard. They were received by Admiral
Dewey, Captain Lamberton, Lieutenant
Brumby and the officer of the deck,
the full marine guard and band being
paraded. The officers went to the ad
miral's cabin. Rear Admiral Sampson
paid that he was delighted with the
evident pood health of Admiral Dewey
and he told the admiral that he looked
much younger than most of the port
raits made him out to be. Rear Ad
miral Sampson remained on board for
more than an hour and after returning
to the Dolphin he said:
"Admiral Dewey is delighted, as is
every one aboard, to reach his native
shore a grain. He is much moved by
the great kindness and enthusiasm, of
the people and though shrinking from
public display and ceremony, feels
deeply the regard of which these are
the outcome. In fact he feels and ex
presses him e elf precisely as a man of
his fine and modest temperament may
be expected to do. The country honors
in him these fine qualities as well as
those sterner ones which have given
-
him his fame.
Rear Admiral Sampson had first
learned of Admiral Dewey's arrival at
the Brooklyn navy yard, where he went
about 10 o'clock to see Rear Admiral
Philip. Soon after Rear Admiral Samp
son had gone Rear Admiral Philip
voyaged down the bay in the Narkeeta
and made an official call, attended by
Commander J. D. J. Kelley. The rear
admiral's salute was not fired in this
:ase by request of Rear Admiral Philip.
Admiral Dewey received these official
visits in undress uniform.
Dr. Sanborn of the port physicians'
staff visited the Olympic and look' at
her papers. Eleven of the crew of 375
men have typhoid fever. Some of the
?oses are convalescent and all of them
are of a mild type, according to Dr.
Percy, the ship's surgeon. No one has
3ied of the fever and with this excep
tion the sailors and marines are well.
Dr. Percy is unable to account for the
presence of the fever on the ship. The
cases are not numerous or serious
enough to cause, him alarm and it is
probable that the sick men will be
taken ashore to a hospital to-morrow.
George Bidwell, Collector of the Port,
Postmaster Vancott and several of the
customs' officials visited the admiral
and were personally conducted around
the ship by him.
AJI day tugs, sail boats and excur
sion steamers came up near the Olym
pia and took a look at her. Every
body who asked was* permitted to
come aboard. Rome of the parties of
sightseers on launches and steamers
were invited by the officer of the deck
to come up the gangway. The Olym
pia's anchorage is rather a lonely
place, and rot a great many vessels
make a point of going there. The
North German Lloyd steamer Saale,
outward bound, passed close to the
Olympia. The Saale's passengers
crowded to the rails. Admiral Dewey
responded to waving pocket handker
chiefs by lifting his cap several times.
The Saale's band played the "Star-
Spangled Banner," and the Olympia
dipped her flag. The Cunarder Urania
passed out half an hour afterward.
She fired seventeen signal bombs. Ad
miral Dewey directed the Olympia's
band to play "God Save the Queen."
The admiral about 5 o'clock returned
Sir Thomas Upton's visit. Lieutenant
Brumby and the admiral's son, George
G. Dewey, were with him. Sir Thomas
met the admiral at the starboard gang
way, with his friends, and the entire
party went to the after cabin,' where
the health of the admiral, the Sham
rock and of course the Columbia, was
drunk amid enthusiasm.
The admiral remained on board for
nearly half an hour and then started
for his ship. The Erin's crew began to
cheer, and as his launch drew away the
entire ship's company, guests, officers,
crew, servants, Singalese and all, led
by Sir Thomas, with a "Hip, hip, hip,"
gave three honest cheers, the kind the
admiral heard from the British war
ships in Manila Bay. Admiral Dewey
waved his gold-bound cap like a school
boy as he stood on the rail of his little
white-canopied launch being given a
hearty welcome in his own home
waters by a hundred foreigners.
Admiral Dewey purposes, unless his
plans shall be changed by the reception
committee, to bring the Olympia up the
lower bay and anchor inside the harbor
with the squadron of United States
warships off Tompkinsville, of which
squadron he is now in superior com
mand. <
COMMITTEE
MEETS DEWEY
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â The unex
pected arrival of the cruiser Olympia
with Admiral George Dewey for a time
completely upset the elaborate plans of
the reception committee. Before proÂ»
ceedfng further in the arrangements
fur the reception in Dewey's honor it
was decided to consult the great nuval
hero. After a hasty meeting in the
City Hall all the members of the "sub- |
committee of the reception committee
but two, William C. -Whitney and Lev!
P. Morton, this afternoon visited the
warship arid talked over the plans with
the admiral.
When the programme was explained j
to him. Admiral Dowey said it was very '
satisfactory, and that he would re
main aboard the Olympia until Friday â 
morning and would then receive the
official visit of Mayor A an Wyck.
The police boat Patrol took the sub- j
committee and Mayor Van Wyck's re- I
port to the Olympia. St. Clair McKel- !
way was chosen acting chairman. He
was accompanied, by Richard Cr'oker)
Senator Depew, ex-Congressman Wil- '
liam McAdoo, Warren W. Foster and
Howard Carroll. Mayor Van Wyck
was represented by his secretary, Al
fred M. Downs, Among others on the
Patrol were Chief of Police Devery
and President York â¢â ; the Police Board.
Approaching Admiral Dewey's Hag
ship, this message was wigwagged to
the warship:
"We are the police steamboat Patrol,
having on board representatives of the
Mayor of the city of New York. Will
you make gangway starboard or port?"
No answer was made to this message,
but a few minutes later the Olympia's
steam launch was alongside the Patrol
to carry the delegation to the cruiser.
The representatives of the city ascend- i
ed the gangway to the warship's deck,
headed by Mr. Downs. There, on the
after quarter on the starboard side of. l
the cruiser, the visitors were met by
Flag Lieutenant Brumby, who intro
duced them to Admiral Dewey and
Captain Lamberton and the members
of the sub-committee. After a hearty
handshake with the. visitors Admiral j
Dewey invited the city's representa- I
tives into his cabin. After seating his j
callers in a half circle about him. Ad
miral Dewey also took a chair. Secre
tary Caldwell of the Olympia took a
place at the admiral's left hand and
Flag Lieutenant Brumby at his right.
Recognizing ex-Assistant' Secretary
of the Navy McAdoo, Admiral Dewey
remarked, "You remember how it was
in the Navy Department to get things ',
done, but it is better now."
McAdoo was about to reply, when
Acting Chairman McKelway addressed
the admiral, explaining that the pur
pose of the visit was to submit, for the
admiral's approval an outline of the
plans for the celebration. Admiral i
Dewey at once assented to th proposal
that the Mayor call upon him at 11
o'clock Friday morning, saying:
"As I wrote to Genera] Butterfield, !
[ am entirely in the hands of the com
mittee and any arrangements that it
makes will be agreeable to me. Eleven
o'clock Friday I'll be there, but I want
to say that I hope my strength will
hold out through th; celebration. On
my way here I did not accept any
courtesies excepting at Naples. There
I took one dinner, and they persuaded j
me to take four dinners, and I was sick j
for a week."
The admiral agreed to all of the pro
gramme for Fridayâ the naval parade â
except the last detail, which was that
he should ' spend Friday night at the
Waldorf-Astoria. He said:
"I will stay on board the ship that
night. . Now, I understand that the
committee, has done away with the j
Saturday ' breakfast and you want to
start early on the following morning
you want to start before breakfast."
Mr. Foster here explained that ar- i
rangements had been made for a lunch
eon on board the Mayor's steamer.
"That is very nice, very satisfactory. j
I understand I am expected at the City
Hall at 9 o'clock," said Admiral Dewey. j
"Would It be convenient to come to j
New York In your own launch or one j
of the city's boats?" inquired General j
Carroll. v 1 v.;"
"My launches are slow. It might be j
a bad day and the launch might be j
awash from the craft in the harbor,"
replied the admiral.
"How about the crew of this ship?" j
quickly inquired Admiral Dewey. j
"How will they get ashore? I've got
850 men here and th*y all want to go, \
and how will they get over from where j
we are anchored?"
Mr. McAdoo explained that the city
would supply. boats for the transfer.
"That is all right," said the admiral
with a smile, "that will be very satis- j
factory. The men can go ashore in the j
morning. "I've arrived here a few ;
days in advance of the time," he con- |
tinued, "but I thought it would be
better to be a few days ahead than one |
day behind," soothingly said the ad- j
miral to the committee. "You know the
State I come from. We have to scratch '
gravel in Vermont. I thought it would j
be better to spend two or three days
inside here. If we were one day be
hind it might have upset some of the j
arrangements. I have made it a cus- I
tom in life to try to be two or. three I
days ahead instead of an hour behind." j
A suggestion having been made that ,
the admiral come ashore before the
celebration, he interrupted the speaker,
saying: "I shall remain on board this i
ship until \ Friday morning when the I
Mayor calls." "
The committee, after a brief personal
chat, withdrew and returned to shore.

lado. It was signed by Luna. Admiral Dewey then said that Luna was the
best man the Filipinos had.
"It was a plot to assassinate him," he said. "A crack swordsman was
placed as sentry, and when Luna appeared he simply stabbed him. But
these fellows all," said the admiral, "are a queer lot. They were simply
servants and stablemen, and Aguinaldo was a junior clerk in the navy-yard.
He Is a pretty smart fellow. I knew him pretty well. In fact, we were
great friends, and are, for that matter of fact, but he has not the brains.
There are people behind him, some of them lawyers and able fellows, who
make a tool of Aguinaldo. Here, by the way, is a cane which he presented
to me," and the admiral produced a thick black stick, carved, and resem
biing Irish bog oak more than anything else.
"I thought," said the admiral, "that this thing in the Philippines would
be over long before this, as it should have been. I can't imagine how
they have stood out until now. Of Course there was the rainy season and I
suppose little was done. One great trouble out there has been that General
iii- has tried to do too much. I told him so. He wants to be general,
governor, judge and everything else â to have hold of all the irons. No man
ran do that. This is the great trouble. It is enough for a man to do one
thing, to be one thing, but when a man tries to do everything and be every
thing, it is easy to imagine the result.
"The fight in the Philippines should be easily ended. The people ha-vip
been so badly treated for such a length of time by the Spaniards that they
are distrustful. This is the great difficulty in dealing with them. Where
we have met them and they have been in such contact with us as to learn
that we mean to treat them well, where they have seen that we mean what
we say, there is no trouble. They stand by us all the time. All of them will
learn this in time. They will get from under the influence of Aguinaldo,
or rather those people who are behind Aguinaldo, who, as I said before,
is a mere tool.

WASHINGTON
SURPRISED
Naval Officials Lose No
Tim 3 in Extending
a Welcome.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.â The Navy
Department, equally with New York,
onsi !' n bly surprised this morn
ing at the arrival of the Olympia. at
Sandy Hook. The first official intima
tion that the Olympia had reached
came in this dispatch from the
admiral :
Sandy Hook. N. J.. Sept. 2<5.
Secretary Navy: Olympia will go to
Tompkinsville to-morrow. . - DEWEY.
To this message Secretary Long re
plied:
Admiral Dewey, Sandy Hook: The de
partment is happy to learn of your safe
arrival, and extends to you and to your
officers and crew a most cordial welcome
home. .. JOHN D, LONG.
Secretary Long said -this afternoon
that no definite decision .= had â¢ been
reached as to the admiral's ' future
duty. He said he desired to discuss the
matter with the admiral and learn his
wishes.
It is understood â  that immediately
after the > festivities at New York
formal orders will be issued detaching
the admiral from the Olympia, and he
will then be granted indefinite leave,
should he desire it.
There is no important board to which
the admiral could be assigned, and
when Long discusses the matter with
him it would not be surprising if he
should desire him to accept the post
of official adviser to the Secretary.
Upon the detachment of the admiral
the Olympia will proceed to Boston,
where she will be thoroughly repaired.
Before being placed out of commission
a board of survey will inspect her and
submit a report in regard to repairs
needed. Captain Lamberton and the
other officers will be detached and
granted leave, and as most of the crew
are short time men they, will be dis
charged -from the service.
It was reported to-day that Secretary
Long had instructed Admiral Dewey to
â  to Washington immediately, but
this report is denied by officials, as is
j also the report that the department is
displeased with the admiral because of
the arrival of the Oiynlpia before the
>hÂ«j was due.
After conferring with the President
and Secretary Long, Mr. Allen, the As
; Secretary of the Navy, left here
this afternoon for the purpose of seeing
Admiral Dewey and discussing the ar
rangements for the next few days.
During the Cabinet meeting to-day
plans were matured for the official
ceremony at the Capitol, when the
President will present to Admiral
Dewey the sword awarded by Congress.
Mr. Allen will learn the admiral's
wishes in this regard, and will go over
the several other features of the na
tional ceremony to be carried out
when he arrives here, including the de
tails of the dinner the President will
give to the admiral next Tuesday
night.
AN AERIAL SALUTE
TO ADMIRAL DEWEY
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â William E.
Kddy, according to his own statement,
to-night broke all records in high kite
flying with colored lights attached.
Two kites, forming a tandem, with sev
enteen red, white and blue lights at
tached, we re sent up by Mr. Eddy to a
height of between 2500 and 3000 feet
from a Park Bow building. Mr. Eddy
say.s this is the first time that lights
have been sent up in such numbers on
a kite in New York. The seventeen
lights were intended as a salute to Ad
miral Dewey, but it is doubtful if they
could be seen from where Dewey was.
At half-past 6 o'clock Mr. Eddy sent
up the first kite, and later attached a
second kite, and after his cable had
been sent up a few hundred feet the
lights were attached to it at a distance
of from twenty to thirty feet apart.
They were arranged, first a red light,
then a white one and then a blue one.
until the seventeen had been attached.
Each light consisted of a small lan
tprn having a clear colored globe with
a lighted candle inside. The lanterns
were made of cloth and were each six
feet In diameter. Mr. Eddy said that
the lights were at a height where the"
gale was about forty-five miles an
hour, and in such a breeze they re
mained lighted for several hours.
SALUTE FIRED AT
THE STATE CAPITAL
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 26.â When
news was received at 5 o'clock this
morning of the arrival of Admiral
Dewey in New York harbor the fire
whistle was ordered by the Mayor to be
blown, and within a few minutes scores
of whistles and bells joined in the
chorus. At 10 o'clock the adjutant
general, acting under orders from the
Governor, had fired an admiral's salute
of seventeen guns. Thus Admiral
Dewey Was welcomed both on the part
of the city and the State.
SAX DIEGO, Sept. 26.â 0n the an-
nouncement of the arrival of Admiral
Dewey flags were hoisted on all the
I city schools. The children were
I marched out to salute the nag, and the
principals of each school made patriotic
addresses to their pupils. Flags were
raised on the City Hall, Courthouse
and other buildings throughout the
city.

"Do I think the Filipinos are fit for self-government? Well, no, not^
just now. They probably will be in a little time. They are a very queer 4
peopleâ a very queer mixture. Many of them are quite civilized and good^
people, but I do not think they are fit for self-government just yet. But^
when I say that I must add at the same time that it is my candid opinion^
that they are more fitted for it than the Cubans; that they area better^
peuple than the Cubans in every way. I do wish, however, that the whole,*,
business was settled, and I think that after a little the Filipinos will take r
kindly to us." a
It was suggested to the admjral that the Democratic slate had been-'
settled with Admiral Dewey for the Presidency and General Wheeler for the*
Vice Presidency. f
"Well/* said the admiral, "we should make a pretty mess of it. General
Wheeler, of course, has had some training in the political school, but then '
he is a West Pointer. I had forgotten that. He would want to run every- â¦
thing as he would a regiment, and, of course, would make a splendid mess<s>
of it. You cannot run a government as you would a regiment." i
"Well, admiral," suggested the reporter, "it would not be such a change I
from the ship olympia to the ship of state."
- "Yes." said the admiral, "it would be a very great change. lam not T

Some one said just then to the admiral that his son was reported to have â¦
made a statement to the effect that his father was a dyed-in-the-wool <Â£,
Republican.
The admiral laughed outright, and. turning around, pointed to a piece T
of wood lying on the deck some yards away, at the same time saying: "My*
son knows as much about what my politics are as that piece of wood." â¦
The admiral would not say a word about the alleged interference of the^
German admiral, Diederich, at Manila. |
ANVIL CITY
NOW TO BE
CALLED NOME
Interest Taken in the First
Election of City
Officials.
MINERS VICTORIOUS
Fears That There Will Not Be
Enough Vessels to Aooommodate
People Who Wish to Leave.
BY EUGENE SCOTT.
NOME, Alaska, Sept. 13, via Seattle,
Wash,, Sept. 26.â At a meeting of the
citizens held on September 6 the name
of Anvil City was changed to Nome.
This was done to make the name of the
city correspond with the name of the
Postoffice, which had been Nome from
the time of its establishment.
The greatest event by far that has
taken place at Nome was the election
of city officers yesterday. There were
about 1400 votes cast in the three wards
and excitement ran high all day and
night. Saloons were wide open and in
the Second Ward the polling place was
in a saloon, which made it very handy
for the dry voters, and as a conse
quence fights were quite frequent, but
no one was seriously hurt, which speaks
vtry well for the soldiers and town
officers. The following meu were
elected:
Mayor, T. D. Cashel; Treasurer, J. P.
Kudd; Municipal Judge, A. Kawson;
Chief of Police, W. Eddy; Councilmen,
First Ward, Charles A. Pennington and
A. Lowe; Councilmen, Second Ward,
George A. Wright and T. Robertson;
Couifcilmen, Third Ward, C. P. Dam
and J. B. Miller. The result for Coun
cilmen in the Third Ward is in doubt.
The newly elected officers will receive
their salaries by levying assessments
on the business houses and property
owners. It was freely talked that one
of the tickets up for election was com
posed of the "Soapy Smith" gang of
Skaguay notoriety and they were being
fought very hard by the beachcombers.
The miners' ticket carried throughout.
The Bteamer Alliance leaves to-day
at noon for Seattle with 160 passengers,
among others on board is Mr. Lind
blo in of Undbloom, Lunderberg & Co.,
the owners of the richest mines here.
Lindbloom is going out to lay in sup-
I'li* s for the coining season. They have
taken out a half million dollars already,
according to one of the partner's ac
count. They expect to do much better
next year with the improvements they
will bring in.
There are fully 2000 people now look
ing for passage out and some uneasi
n< ps is felt for fear there will not be
i nough vessels to take them all out.
Coal is also scarce and unless some
is brought in soon ther* will be a gen
eral stampede to get out Lumber is
now worth Sir.o IK >r thousand, and ow
in:r to its price many cannot afford to
build suitable winter quarters. There
will be about 2000 people to winter here.
FOUR HUNDRED MINERS
ARRESTED AT NOME
TACOMA, Sept. 26.-Passengers from
Cape Xome, who arrived to-day on the
steamer Alliance, tell an Interesting Btory
of the arrest of nearly 400 miners along
the beach at Cape Nome last month.
Claim jumping and filing on claims by
power of attorney has caused an almost
endless amount of trouble. These" causes
led the Cape Nome Mining and Develop
ment Company to lay claim to a strip of
beach ground, from which 380 miners were
washing gold. The company made com
plaint, with the result that all of these
miner? were taken Into custody and
marched to Anvil City.
Their claims to the ground in dispute
wore to be heard together. Before action
could be taken, however, the captain of
the revenue cutter Rear heard of the dif
ficulty and came ashore. He sided with
the miners, declaring that the beach from
sixty feet above the tide line to three
miles out at sea belonged to the Govern
ment, and that he had control of it as
the Government's naval representative in
those waters. He held that one man hnd
as much right a? another to wash gold
out of thp bfacli and that no company
could appropriate it. On his orders the
beach miners were accordinuly discharged

1/ >NDON, Sept. 2<">.â The general feel-
Ing, Including. that of the pro-Boers, as
indicated by articles in the afternoon
ra to-day, is that the published dis
patch of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies,. Mr. Chamberlain, to the Brit
ish Hieh Commissioner in South Africa,
Sir Alfred Milner, clears the way for
. if the Boers desire it. In any
ev< at, it is pointed out, it affords
fun her delay, which, in the case of
Great Rrituir, is certainly advantage
ous, as it s;iv.>s time for th- 3 reinforce
ment of the garrisons at the Cape. The
papers generally, however, express the
hope thai President Kruger will now
bis way to meet Great Britain's
views, and the Westminster <:azette,
.whuh is not an anti-Boer paper, says:
"President Kruger and his advisors
Btill have a chance of securing peace
with independence."
In the meanwhile the dispatch of
troops to South Africa proceeds unin
terrupt< dly. Three lic-ld batteries ar
rival at Birkenhead to-day and will
embark for Durban, Natal.
A cablegram i'r in Cape Town says:
Quantities of stores and ammunition
arc leaving here daily. The movement
of th* 1 troops to N.itnl is merely a pre
cautionary measure to secure the coal
mines, and is in no vise in the nature
of menace. There are no Imperial troops
un the in. border. Rumors of
collisions should b<- received with cau
tion.

GERMANY THINKS
ENGLAND SEEKS DELAY
BERLIN', Sept. 26.â The publication
of Mr. Chamberlain's telegrams to Sir
Alfred Mllner, British High Commis
sioner in S. uth Africa, calls forth but
few comments from the German press.
The optimistic views expressed yester
day have givqn way to a general feeling
in many quarters that war is Inevitable
and that the course of British policy is
merely a ruse to gain time to complete
the military preparations.
The National Zeitung says: "The
statements made in the Transvaal
green book are a flat contradiction of
Mr. Chamberlain's version of the live
years' franchise offer and each Govern
ment taxes the other with perfidy re
garding- the rest."
The Neueste Naohrichten says: "The
turn given to the suzerainty question
is really nothing but a play upon words.
The Transvaal is. of course, not sov
ereign, as England's veto restricts it
as a treaty-making power. Nor has
this ever been denied by the Transvaal,
whose Government only wants a re
striction Â°f England's interference in
internal affairs."

ACTIVE VOLCANO
ON JAMES ISLAND
Leander's Crew Get a
Good View of It.
Social Dispatch to Thf Call.
VICTORIA, B. C Sept. 26.â When H.
M. S. Leander, which returned to Esqui
malt to-day, was cruising in the waters
of South America her officers were given
a fireworks exhibition by dame nature,
When the warship called at the Gala
pagos Islands, a group of five large and
ten small islands belonging to Ecquador,
n volcano wps found to be going in full
blast, throwing huge fountains. of sparks,
rocks and molten earth high into the air
and sending streams of lava rolling down
the island slopes to explode with a roar
like hundreds of batteries as they joined
the sea. The volcano, which is said to
have become active about three months
ago, is on James Island, which attains
an elevation of about 3000 feet above the
sea level. It is a mass of volcanoes <>f
varied sorts and sizes, most of which
have been extinct for some years.
The Leander went in as close as she
could with safety and those on board
up< nt a day and a night making obser
vations of the pyro technical display and
broad rivers, of lava. There vvas no dam
age, the officers say. There is nothing
there to be damaged, for the island is
uninhabited. Charles, Chatham Tind Al
bemarie, three other islands of the. group,
are used by the Government of Ecuador
as a prison for those who offend politi
cally.
One of the Leander's officers has a col
lection of plants and flowers from Cha
tham Island which he proposes to send
to the British Museum. He is a deep
Btudent of botany, and says the speci
mens of the islands" flora secured by him
can be found nowhere else on the face of
the earth.
When the Meander was going into Cal
lao the British bark Tenesseran was
found stranded off the Kimac River. For
three days the Leander worked at her
before, with the assistance of the steamer
Bakquin. towing ahead, she was saved.
When she left the mud she narrowly es
caped colliding with the warship.
SWALLOWED CARBOLIC
ACID BY MISTAKE
Mrs. R, M. Donne of San Rafael Has
a Narrow Escape From
Death.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 2*s.â Mrs. R. M.
Donne, the wife of a popular local mer
chant, nearly lost her life to-day at> a re
sult of a mistake in swallowing a mix
ture of carbolic acid and glycerin. She
has been in 111 health and under the care
of a physician for several months past.
At t> o'clock this morning she arose from
bed and took the poison from a bottle on
! Iho mantel instead of the medicine in
t another bottle close to the mixture of
carbolic acid and glycerin, which had
been used in treating a dog with the
mange.
An hour later she was discovered in an
unconscious condition by Mrs. Ennis, the
nurse, who summoned Drs. Keck and
Wickmnn. After three hours' labor. Mrs.
Donne was pronounced out of dancer.
Her husband, who has been spending a
â vacation at Duncans and Vichy Springs,
arrived home just as his wife regained
consciousness.
Donne's troubles have not come singly,
for he returned on crutches as the result
of a bad sprain of the right ankle. As
he ascended the steps of his residence
the dog. whoso affliction was indirectly
responsible for Mrs. Donne's condition,
leaped joyfully upon its master and threw
him off his balance. He fell and severely
sprained the left wrist in addition to
wrenching the injured ankle.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1899.

BOERS VERY ANXIOUS
TO COMMENCE FIGHTING
LONDON, Sept. 26.â The Times has a
dispatch from Johannesburg; which as
sorts that the delay is creating the
worst possible Impression in the minds
of the burghers, who tauntingly boast
that while Great Britain deprecates de
lay upon the part of the Boers, she in
tentionally and unnecessarily prolongs
the controversy because she is afraid
to follow up her own game of bluff with
the arguments of force.
Reports are heard on all sides of the
eagerness of the Boers to start hostili
ties, and their postponement is said to
be wholly due to the restraining in
fluence of General Joubert. It is added
that it is believed that this influence
cannot be exercised much longer. There
is a circumstantial rumor that General
Joubert has received imperative orders
from the armed burghers that unless
h<> Is prepared to take the Initiative
within a brief period he must relinquish
his command of the army. This is
looked upon as an instructive indica
tion of Boer feeling.

STRIKE AVERTED
Students Will Take No
Immediate Action.
M'NAUGHTON'S UNPOPULARITY
SAID TO HAVE APPOINTED A
NUMBER OF SPIES.
Through Threats of Expulsion Trus
tees Secure a Copy of the Min
utes of the Students'
Meeting.
i I Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN* JOSE, Sept. 26.â The threatened
] strike among State Normal School stu
i dents has been averted for a time, but
j the student body declare the matter will
come up again. The faculty and local
j trustees were busy late into last night
; and early this morning doing missionary
work among the students, and by threats
\ and bribes succeeded in allaying the
i trouble. The student body l.s not satis
fied with this smoothing over and declare
i that Professor Daily insulted them and
j he must yet apologize. They assert that
| they have always conducted themselves
jas ladles and gentlemen and the. vice
principal had no reason to rebuke them
as he did.
The students declare that Daily is act
ing as "Man Friday" to Principal Mc-
Naughton and is simply carrying out the
orders of his superior. Last night Prln
; eipa.l McNaughton and Chairman Brown
or the trustees called upon the president
of the student body and demanded the
', minutes of. yesterday's meeting, but were
refused them. Miss June Chappell, the
B&cfetary, was then visited, ana through'
threats of expulsion a copy of the pro- I
j oeodings was secured.
At the meeting this afternoon COO stu
, dents wore present. The committee on
resolutions presented the following, which
had been prepared by Daily: "That we,
the student body of the State Normal '
; School, agree to support the authorities
of this school in all methods of discipline
; which they deem best." This caused a
; groan, and about two-thirds of the stu
dents refrained from voting. It passed.
The committee states that through
threats and bribes they were compelled
to present this. There is ill feeling among
the students and trouble is expected at
any time.
Principal McNaughton has appointed a
i couple of dozen spies among the teachers
and students to watch the scholars, and
j this is causing trouble. Threats have also I
; been made that Otto Mouron, the leader
, of yesterday's meeting, will be expelled
i If this Is done fully 600 students will leave i
| the school.
It is reported that Principal Mc
j Naughton realizes that he cannot man
, age the school and has given Vice Prin
j cipal Daily full authority and that he
will remain principal in name only and
draw the salary.

Forest Fires Raging in San

Counties.
MIXES THREATENED
Gangs of Men Are WorkiDg N'ght
â¢ and Day to Prevent ihe Spread
of the Destroyer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 26.â Forest fires
have been raging in the Cuyamaca
Mountains, fifty miles west of here, for
over a week and have done immense
damage to the timber and watersheds.
The flames started about ten days ago
on the north peak of the Cuyamaca
range, known as Kelly's Mountain and
adjoining the Cuyamaca reservoir. How
the fire started no one seems to know.
It has spread in a northerly direction,
I burning over thousands of acres of
timber lands, destroying the sawmill
on the Kelly ranch, and has rendered
the road impassable between Stonewall
j and Julian. The house of James Tally
was only sav-d by heroic efforts as the
fire burned around it.
The fire has been checked toward the
north, but is now burning toward the
southern and main peak of the Cuya
maca range, which is heavily timbered.
It is reported here that the Golden
'â¢ Key mine in the path of the fire was
destroyed so far as buildings and ma
chinery are concerned.
PLACERVILLE, Sept. 26.â A great
forest flre in the mountains twenty-five
miles northeast of this city threatens
1 to destroy the railroad and camps of
the American River Land and Lumber
Company, together with over ten mil
lion feet of logs lying in the woods.
Lack of water in the south fork of
the American River has prevented the
company making any drive to their
mills at Folsom for the past two years.
The fire is a mile and a half in width
and if not subdued within the next
twenty-four hours the great plant of
the lumber company will undoubtedly
be destroyed.
Another fire is raging in the vicinity
of Grizzly Flats near the Mount Pleas
ant mine. A large forcp of men is kept
busy fighting it away from the build
ings of the mine. It is thought that
the fire is incendiary, as James Lyons
discovered pome men sotting fresh fires
the night before last. They ran as soon
as they found they were discovered and
he followed them on horseback for two
miles, but they finally disappeared in
the brush. He could not identify them.
It is thought that they are trying to
destroy the Mount Pleasant property.
A force of six men is kept on guard I
constantly over the mine aijd if the I
guilty parties are caught it will go
hard with them.
HIGH PRICE FOR
RAISIN CROP
Growers Think It Will
Boom the Industry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Sept. 2(5.-The directors of the
California Raisin Growers' Association,
who wore in session all day, created a
surprise here this evening by announcing
that they had fixed the price of four
crown raisins at 6V2 cents a pound in the
sweat box. The price is the highest ever
obtained in this county, and if the asso
ciation succeeds in maintaining it the re
sult will be an unprecedented boom in the
rq.isin industry.
One of the reasons for the action taken
by the association is the shortage In the
crop this year. On account of the late
frosts and the lateness of the season the
yield, it Is thought, will be much smaller
than last year. The directors thought the
extraordinary raise in price necessary to
! compensate for the loss to the growers
: by reason of the shortage.
Another reason for making the price so
; high Is the fact that all of last year's
â¢ crop has been disposed of at the prices
j fixed by the association. Not only were
j the rates maintained In every instance,
but the market was cleared in time for
this year's crop. This encouraged the as
sociation to make the price higher this
year.
At to-day's meeting the directors also
fixed the price to he demanded for two
; crown and three-crown goods. They will
j ask s^> cents a pound for the former and
6 cents for the latter. These classes,
however, compose a very small portion of
the crop, most of the raisins being four
crown.
For layers the following prices were
fixed: Two-crown London, $1 50 a box;
: throe-crown London, $2; four-crown fancy
clusters, $2 50; five-crown Dehesa clusters,
j $2 GO; six-crown imperial clusters. $3; seed-
I less Muscatels, 6 cents a pound. The
, above prices are f. o. b. to common ship
i ping points, and on condition that raisins
are paid for before shipment.
M. Theo Kearney, president of the as
sociation, thinks the outlook very prom
ising for the growers, and feels sanguine
that the prices will be maintained, not
withstanding they are higher than those
that prevailed in boom days and three
times as high as those obtained last year.

TROUBLE IN SAMOA
Quiet Prevails But the Actions of

AUCKLAND. N. Z., Sept. 26.-Advlees
from Samoa under date of September 20
j received here to-day say quiet prevails
j there, but the feeling among the whites
is that there is trouble ahead. It is added
that Yon Bulow. the former lieutenant
in the German army, who organized the
forces of Matanfn. has been going about
the country interviewing the Mataafa

SHARK DRAGS DOWN
A GERMAN SAILOR
Orje of the Geier's Seamerj Meets
Death When Help Was
Near.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 26.â The sailors of her Majesty's ship Lean- <
der, which arrived this morning from Central America, were witnesses i
of, without being able to avert, the horrible death of a seaman of the \
German warship Geier at Corinto last August. The German with some S
comrades, had left the ship to bathe in the swift running and shark- <
infested waters of Corinto Bay. They were splashing merrily to the <
amusement of a crowd of British sailors who were watching their an- .
tics from the Leander. I
Suddenly there was an outcry and the bathers swam hurriedly \
toward the British war vessel. A dark shadow just below the surface of Â«
the water and a fin's swish showed the cause of alarmâ a shark. <
The Leander's cutter, which according to the British custom is al- *
ways hanging over the quarter, was speedily released from the davits, \
a crew tumbled in and rapidly rowed toward the bathers. One was *
treading water as though fear had rendered his arms useless and when \
the cutter was within twenty feet of him he gave a loud yell and van- \
ished â dragged down by the shark, which wr.s quicker than the would- <
be rescuers. â¢

arouw the Horn, the Moiincs -winning
handily.
The Sardomene was 173 days coining
from Hamburg. The long voyage was due
to light r.-:nds and calms. Captain Mason
says that for days the vessel was be
r&lmec and made more leeway than head
way. The Beacon Reck had- a- coyple of,

Practical problems occupied the atten
tion of the congress at this morning's ses
sion. Dr. Dr-iphagan of Montana, Pro
fessor Whitney or Washington, D. C.
Professor Buftum of Wyoming and others
discuss.*! at length the question of re- |
claiming alkali lands. The principal ad- !
dress at the afternoon session was that of
HonJ E'.wood Mead of Wyoming, whose
subject was, "Water Right Problems." j
The present meeting of the congress is a ;
most successful one. The membership is >
reported of an unusually large number of
States. Indiana on the east and the coast ;
States on the west, Montana on the north i
and New Mexico on the south, represent
the limits covered by the State alesa- j
tions, and they are enthusiastic and sin- â¢
cere. j
At the opening of the afternoon session j
Bishop Shurtleft of Utah presented a res- \
olutlcn of condolence upon the death of j
National Lecturer Emory of Kansas, who
has died since the last meeting of the
congress. This was unanimously adopted.
Horu Elwood Mead, superintendent of the
Federal Bureau of Irrigation in Wyoming,
read an interesting paper on "Water
Rights Problems." Judge Stilwell of
Arizona continued the discussion of the j
water rights problem, especially in its re
iation to the work of the irrigation con
gress. In closing the Judge referred
pleasantly to the results 01 irrigation that
be has seen since cor.me to Montana. {
Gi^-orge H. Maxwell spoke briefly upon the
solution of all these difficulties. State I
Engineer Bond of Wyoming presented a j
paper on â¢"Irrigation in Wyoming." He
set forth the method followed in that ;
State. In obtaining water rights the.]
Wyoming law is regarded generally as a j
model, and its explanation was of mucn
interest to the delegates. State Engineer :
Wilson of Nebraska followed with an in- ;
t^restir.g paper on the irrigation laws and
practices of his State. Mr. Wilson is one >
of the leading, advocates of State control ;
of water, ami in his pap^r he gave much ;
credit and high praise to the Wyoming ;
laws and the men who execute them. He j
regretted that Nebraska's constitution j
did not permit the adoption in full of the
Wyoming laws, but said that the State
had gone as fai as possible along these
lir.r-s. The solution of the water right j
problem according to Mr. Wilson, jies in
the creation of an interstate commission,
which will have power to regulate the apt
portionment of water in an equitable and f
just manner. Â â¢ ' ,
Following Mr. Wilson. D. K. Ross. State
Engineer of Idaho, read sections of Ida- .
hb'a water laws and commented on them |
in an interesting manner. He said the p^o- â 
pie cf Idaho had pride in tht-ir !aw. and !
he explained it in full. At the conclusion !
of Mr. Ross' remarks the congress ad- .
journed until evening. _' .A -
\t the evening session Hon. 1,. T. Can
non secretary of the St. Louis Manufar- j
tnre'rs' Association: was introduced by Dr.
Young and held the audience for twenty
minutes.
Following Mr. anon. Professor Newell
delivered his lecture on the hydrographic
work of the United States Geological Sur
vey of which ho is at the head. The lec
ture was illustrated with â¢ stereopticun !
views. Tha lecturer closed with a discus- j
sion of the possible causes of failure and j
an explanation of the details of the .con
stroction of dams and tho selection of j
site*. The actual work of the congress
will end to-morrow afternoon.
NOVEL USE OF THE
WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
Will Be Utilized to Locate Several
Islands of the Aleutian.
Group.
SEATTLE. Sept. 26.â Superintendent
Henry S. Pritehett of the United Statt^s
Coast and Geodetic Survey announce*
that he will make a new and somewhat
novel use of wireless telegraphy. Next
season the United States steamer Path
finder v.i'.l be s*nt to Alaskan water? to
survey the islands of the Aleutian group
n--ar "Unimak Pass. The islands Mr.
Pritehett says, have boen incorrectly
located on Government charts ard maps.
The Pathfinder was built a year ago at
Elizabeth and IÂ« equipped with the latest
appliances and instruments, including ap
paratus for the r.ew system of telegraphy.
Several islands of the Aleutian group
lying between nfteeen ar.d twenty miles
apart near Unirnak Pass have been se
lected as a field for the use of the wire
less telegraphy. By means of the differ
ence in latitude the location of the islands
will be determined to a fine point.

I SANTA ROSA, Seprt. I When City
Marshal Charles H. Holmes came down
to cpen his office in the City Hall yester
day he discovered that some time during
the night burglars had broken into the
rcoinr and '.completely ransacked it. A
valuable banjo, several articles of minor
valne ar.d. about ?W. in cash were takeji.
The money- represented the aggregate
sum taken frvm Sunday's grist of ine
briates and deposited in the- Marshal's
office for safe keeping. When released
this morning the men demanded their
money. It was not available, so a hur
ried meeting of the City Council was
called and the sum appropriated from thÂ«
general fund in the city treasury. So far
no clew has been discovered as to the
identity of the burglars.
The robber;,- undoubtedly occurred be
tween the hours of 3 and 5 this morning.
When the night force left the City Hall
on its last round, about 3 o'clock, every
ing was all right, but when the doors
were opened shortly after 4 o'clock the
scene was one of much confusion.

â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26.â The an
nouncement that Archbishop Chapelle of
New Orleans has been chosen Apostolic
Delegate for the Philippines attracts much
attention in official and clerical circles.
The position has been vacant up to this
time and owing to the large property in
terests of the church in the Philippines,
the official status it occupied under Spain
and the Influence of the clergy over the
natives it has been regarded as an im
portant factor in reconstruction. About
a year aero the Pope named Archbishop
Chapelle aa Apostolic Delegate for Cuba
and Porto Rico, but no appointment was
made for the Philippines and the Arch
bishop cf Manila has continued to exer
cise chief jurisdiction, dealing directly
with Rome.
In view of the hitter's former strong
pro-Spanish views his co-operation with
the United States military authorities at
Manila has been the source of much sat
isfaction to the church authorities h^re.
But it is felt that the presence of a dele
gate in this country, authorised to act for
the Vatican, will permit more direct co
operation on the questions which are
constantly arising. Under Spanish rule
the Archbishop of Manila was a Govern
ment official, reciving $12.0Â«>0 annually,
while four bishops at the head of four dio
ceses constituting the island received
59>jO. . This status no longer exists and
the church officials are maintained out of
the church resources. It is expected that
Archbishop Chapelle's appointment will
permit a reorganization of the church sys
tem of the islands, based on changed con
ditions.

WASHINGTON. Sept. 26.â 1t has been

its environs and extending north, covering
the territory occupied by General
Arthur. The other department prob
v. ill be in the north of the island,
with headquarters on Lingayen Bay.
Each of these departments in Luzon will
be under a major general. A department
probably will br- established covering the
Visayan group of islands and another the
-;roup. Each of these will be under
the command of a brigadier general. The
plan is not fully arrange-"}, but the latest
proposition embracing these features

SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
BOY BREAKS JAIL
Distracted the Sheriff's Atteo
tion aod Slipped Out of the
Open Door.
PAX RAFAEL. Sept. 26.â Little Manuel Morris, the sÂ»ven-year-old <
.'â !â¢ r who vas sentenced to spend ten days in the County Jail for j
trying to wreck freight cars on the narrow-gauere line, and afterward ;
proved himself to be a diminutive "bad man" by breaking the window ,
and furniture of his cell and trying to knock the head off Sheriff Tay
lor with a bed slat, has capped the climax of his misdeeds by escaping ;
from the custody of the authorities and fleeing to parts unknown. Ag^ â 
and inexperience seem to be no handicap in the case of this wee culprit, ;
as the clever method he employed in regaining his freedom and the cool- |
ness displayed in carrying his plan into execution would have done honor j
to a veteran "crook."
The boy has been confined in a cell off a larger one, on the opposite \
side of the large cell being a bathroom. Little Manuel had the freedom ;
of all three apartments. When Deputy Sheriff Lucas took the child nls '
breakfast this morning his attention was attracted to the bathroom by )
the Bound of running water and the wet condition of the floor near the i
bathroom door. He walked over to investigate and the small prisoner, j
who had hidden behind the door opening into the suite of cells, chos '
the opportunity to slip outside, make his escape from the basement an
go into hiding. When Lucas had stopped the water from running h
sought little Manuel and found him not. Realizing then that the water '
had been turned on and thrown over the floor to attract his attention j
he ran outside the building and saw the boy running in the direction of j
the broad-gauge depot. Lucas gave chase, but the little fellow was too '<
fleet of foot and outdistanced his pursuer.
ManueFs parents have promised that when the lad returns they will I
send him to some relatives living <^n a ranch, where he can be kept out 5
of mischief. Otherwise, if captured, the authorities say he will have to |
be sent to a reformatory.

DIED A VICTIM OF
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
Miss Lorena Krapp of Los Getos
Passes A\ray in the Ap;"W3
Asylum.
BAN JOSE, Sept- 26.â Miss Lorena
Krapp of Los Gates, the young Chris
tian Scientist who was committed to
Agnews asylum less than a week ago,
died at that institution last night. She
was a talented musician, 29 years of
age. Deceased was raised in Minne
sota, and at one time was instructor in
the Young Ladies' Seminary in that
State and in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Several years ago she removed to Los
Gatos with her mother.
While stopping in Chicago she be
came interested in Christian Science.
She studied the works of Mrs. Eddy
Baker and took a course of lectures
from a healer named Fluno in Oakland.
These people played upon her feelings
and in a short time it weakened her
mind. 11l health overcame her, and
they then advised her to use her
mind force as a cure and abstain from
food and reject all medicines. Under
these conditions her mind gave way
and she became a raving maniac.
When it was too late physicians were
called in. They declared Christian Sci
ence responsible for Miss Krapp's con
dition. She was a firm believer in the
doctrine and would listen to nothing
else.
Mrs. Krapp. the mother of the girl,
charges the Christian Scientists with
wrecking her daughter's mind, and also
holds them responsible for her death.
Miss Christian and Evanerelina Baker,
healers, she characterizes as fiends, and
says they worked with her daughter
until they obtained complete control of
her.

A COMMON TROUBLE.
Thousands Suffer From It Without
Knowing Its Real Character.
No trouble is more common or more
misunderstood than nervous dyspepsia.
People bavins it think that their nerves
are to blame, are surprised that they are
not cured by nerve medicines and spring
remedies; the real seat of mischief is lost
BiÂ£ht of; the stomach is the organ to be
looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have any
' pain whatever in the stomach nor perhaps
.â¢ " any of the usual symptoms of stomach
' â¢ â weakness. Nervous dyspepsia shows itself
..â¢ not in the stomach so much as in nearly
every other organ; In some cases the heart
palpitates and is irregular; in others, the
kidneys are affected; in others, the bow-

appetite, with the accumulation of gas, 1

the Irrepressible small boy fn>m creep

become monotonous to the five club
wielders, for when Sergeant Albert Per
rin appeared upon the Bcene at 9 o'clock
be could find no trace of his underlings.
He looked In all directions without suc
cess, and while be was wondering what
had become of them the circus manager
excitedly informed him that at least hxj
buys had made an illegal entrance Into
the show.
ther proof that the railroad support would
have been given to him but for the str> n
uous objection of the Crockers and Mrs.
Stanford. In effect Herrln said in passing
a gold brick to De Young:
"Sou are Mr. Huntingdon's first choice
for United States Senator. Personally I
am jour frined. and you are my lirst
choice. I believe that you are the ablest
man in the State and that you are entitled
to the office, but owing to influences
which Mr. Huntington cannot control the
railroad cannot support you."
Unquestionably De Young- was Hunt
[ngton's first choice, and The Call would
not bf suprrised to learn that the rail
way maycnate had consented 10 overlook
De' Young's recent comment and go back
to the original plan. The Call believes
that De Young is so anxious to go to the
I'nited States Senate that he would wipe
out the past and readily accept the sup
port of the Southern Pacific Company.
Happily for the commonwealth of <"ali
fornia railroad support in a Senatorial
campaign when the Republicans are In
power Is not equivalent to railroad suc
cess. The members of the Legislature in
extra or regular session are answerable
to th<-> prop],, for their conduct. Ther.' is
more than a grain of truth in the story
of Burns' retirement from the contest.
Men whose surroundings enable them to
obtain inside information assert that
Huntington has resolved to withdraw the
support which was extended to Burns at
Sacramento last winter.
When Collis P. Huntington, through
Hr-rrin, passed IV Young one gold brick
he did not exhaust the supply. There
are other glided bricks in the railroad
yard, and another one. more beautiful
than the first, may be presented to Mr.
De Young when the extra session begins.
The sentiment of the people, as cx
presseri in the newspapers throughout tho
State, Is against the election to the Senate
of any corporation candidate. It Is bet
ter that the vacancy exist than to fill it
by the election of a Southern Pacific rep
resentative. From a political point of
view De Young is no better than Burns.
The success of either would wr<vk the
Republican party of the State in 1900.
WANT SIX SUPERVISORS.
Mission District Will Fight for
Full Representation.
The Central Republican League dele
gates from the Thirty-first, Thirty-fourth,
Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth and Thirty
seventh Assembly districts met last night
at 325." Mission street to take action
toward presenting a solid front at the
approaching Republican convention. J.
K. C. Hobbs presided.
One of the primary objects the delegates
have in view la to secure the election of at
least six Supervisors from the. Mission
district The following candidates for the
office were indorsed: T. J. Fields, repre
senting the Thirty-seventh District; Jo
seph L* Count, Thirty-first District;
Charles de Pew, Thirty-fifth District;
Martin Jones and George T. Shaw, grand
secretary of the Odd Fellows, Thirty
fourth District; Henry Burfeind, Thirty
sixth District.
A new candidate for Recorder was pre
sented in -the person of William Tiffany,
who T.'as a candidate for License Collector
against Fred Lees. His name was well
received by the delegates, and he will
probably receive their indorsement.
Martin Feusier, formerly Treasurer of
Virginia City, will .receive the Mission
delegation's support for Treasurer. School
Director Ed Head will be backed for the
office of Sheriff, and John L.ukniann will
be placed In the fight for Assessor.
The meeting refused to champion the
cmise of Treasurer I. J. Truman for re
election, the reason advanced being that
he had used his influence to bring about
the selection of Fred Lees as License Col
lector which, It was claimed, threw the
patronage of that office Into the hands
Âf rrlmmins and Kelly.
At the league caucus to. be held Thnrs
dav night at B'nai B'rith Hall the, Mis
sion delegation will stand as a unit.
rwelft.h Ward Republicans
Fl upper's Hall' on Point- Lobofl and
First avenues was . comfortably filled by
stalwart and enthusiastic ; Republicans
last night. The object of the meeting;
as outlined by George R. Fletcher, who
called the body to order, , was that the
west end of the Twelfth Ward should
have a voice and a say in the selection
of candidates before the coming Republi
can convention. . â¢ .
Having stated the objects of the meet
ing Mr. Fletcher gave , way. to John T.
Williams, who was elected chairman of
the. meeting, with J. J. Cassidy as secre
tary. After a few preliminary remarks
from the young- chairman, D. L. Fitz
gerald introduced, the following resolu
tions. ' .."..... 'â¢'..â . 'â 
' Whereas. The Twelfth Ward- is the second
largest ward In the city and county of San
Francisco in â voting .strength and also Interri
tory; and whereas, â¢ under the provisions of
the new charter eighteen Supervisors are. to bo
elected from the city and county at large on
Tuesday, November 7, 1899;. and whereas, this
above-named ;. Twelfth â  Ward Is rapidly and
surely becoming the residence, portion ;of the
nltv and county of San Francisco, and, as such
requires' a â  vast amount of attention at . the
hands of the Board of Supervisors,' therefore
Resolved/That wÂ«, the Republican voters of
â¢he Twelfth Ward, in mass-meeting assembled,
io petition the convention about to assemble
THE SAN FBANCTSCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1899 c
Somewhat mystified, Sergeant Perrin
blew his whistle, but received no an
swer. Finally h<> went inside, and after
a long search came to a tent from which
procet.'ded loud laughter and talking
that sounded strangely familiar. I'pon
entering the tent he burst upon a
charmed circle. There sat the bearded
lady like a queen on her throne, and
around her in various attitudes were
I'rackbon, Riordan. Norton, Kearney
and Cleu. They looked like so many
courtiers dancing attendance upon their
mistress, and their starry breasts were
that they lelect six of the eighteen candidates
for members of the Hoard of Bupervlson tr^m
the Twelfth Ward: and further.
Resolved. 'Ji-.at a copy of this resolution bo
sent to the raid convention.
Following tlie adoption of these. George
1 Magoonis introduced a resolution favor-
I ing two prominent residents of the west
end for the offices of Supervisors. James
i M. Wilklns, the proprietor of the Cliff
i House, and George Sanderson, son of ex-
Mayor Sanderson. The resolutions were:
Whereas, That portion of the Twelfth Ward
â west of Baker street having never been repre
sented in the Board of Supervisors, and
whereas, this district comprises that section of
the ward which needs the most attention re
garding street improvements, such as the open-
Ing, grading and macadamizing of streets, ad
ditional electric lights, sidewalks, etc.. and
whereas, to obtain these most essential Im
provements it Is absolutely neccessary to have
I>rorer representation in the Board of Super
vlsrs, therefore be It
Resolved, that we, the Republican voters
of this section of the Twelfth Ward in mass
meeting assembled, heartily Indorse James M.
"Wilkins and George R. Sanderson, and hereby
recommend these men to the delegates to the
Republican municipal convention for their ap
proval: and further.
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be
sent to said convention.
Not to be outdone !n his liberality,
George Fletcher recommended Louis Feu
sier of the firm of Martin & Feusier
downtown merchants, for the office of
Treasurer. Mr. Feusier, his sponsor said,
while not a native son of the Golden
West, came to San Francisco when only
3 years of age and grew up with the city
until he became one of its prominent mer
chants. The name was received with
loud cheers.
Among the speakers who addressed the
meeting were George R. Fletcher. L. J.
McMullln, David M. Short, W. P. John
son, Edward Connollev, P. M. McGushin,
D. X Fitzgerald, J." M. Wilkins and
Assemblyman H. W. Miller.
On motion of George R. Fletcher a
vote of thanks was tendered to F. M.
Flugger for the use of his new hall.
The meeting adjourned with three rous
ing cheers "for the success of the Re
publican party.
Considered Candidates.
The Republican delegates of the Forty
second District met last night in the As
' sembly Hall of the Mills building to con
sider the claims of aspiring candidates
; for the coming election. The full delega
; tion was present and A. R. Smith pre-
I sided. Many candidates were present and
! all made brief remarks. In which they
; sÂ»t forth their claims for recognition at
! the hands of the delegation. Among those
i who appeared before the delegation were
Prank Kingwell, ex-Judge Low and Po
lice Judge Thomas Graham, who seek
nominations for Police Judge; Recorder
A. C. Berthier, who desires to be renomi
i nated, and W. G. Dorn, who is a candi

Mochel Is Convicted.
Martin J. Mochr-1, a soldier, who on June
17 last killed Ida Rose Leventhal in the
Campflre Saloon, was convicted by a jury
in Judge Dunre's court yesterday of man
slaughter. An effort was made to prove
that the woman was stabbed by Mochel,
but it sef-ms that she was struck with a
bottle during a drunken row. The convict
will be sentenced Saturday.

they cast upon the fringe-faced damsel.
"it is a downright shame to spoil the
pretty picture," thought the sergeant;
but spoil it he did by the incisive order:

RAILROAD MAGNATES
MUST COME TO TIME
Driven to Salt Lake by the
" Belated Overland,"
Menaced by Competition in Punctuality the
Southern Pacific Deems It Advisable
to Adjust the Time Schedule.
AN exodus of tho gTeat railroad
managers of the Southern Pacific
Company will deplete the yellow
building this week. Third Vice
President J. C. Stubbs, J. A.
Fillmore, Passenger Ag-ent Good
man and Julius Kruttschnltt left last
night for a journey to Salt Lake City,
where they will meet E. O. McCormick,
the head of the passenger traffic depart
ment of tho Southern Pacific and the of
ficials of the Northwestern and Union Pa
citlc railroads. Thoir mission is one of
the cherished secrets that find lodgment
in the nooks and crannies of the Mont
gomery street building, but to the. rail
road men on the street there is but one
reason for the trip, and that is to ar
range a new schedule for the arrival of
Central overland trains.
The Central overland, dubbed the "be
lated," on account of its eccentricity In
reaching this city, has been the butt of
the traveler's wrath and indignation for
several years. Its scheduled time for ar
rival in this city is 8:45 p. m., but the
odds are prohibitive In a betting game
which plays the scheduled time as the fa
vorite. When the train reaches San
Francisco on time the people who await
it or who are passengers on it expect
some great cataclysmic upheaval. It was
the general belief that formerly the train
was purposely delayed to divert traffic to
the Southern route, which was the sole
property of the Southern Paciiic.
At the end of the year the Santa Fe
will have its terminus at this city, and
then the competition for traffic will be
gin. The Southern Pacific realizes that it
must do something to protect Its own in
terests. For several years the complaints
of the traveling public on account of the
uncertainty of Central Pacific trains have
the case to Captain Gillen, who ordered
him to file written charges against his
subordinates who had manifested a pen
chant for a feminine divinity whose
frontispiece is adorned with a "Van
dyke" of colossal proportions. The "cop
pers" now go about singing in muffled
tones the following refrain:
No more we'll succumb to the charms
Of the dame with the beard of fine lacee;
This result we all view with alarmâ
Five cithers may now take our places.
All we want is to set ourselves right.
To the public we make an appeal;

WHY THE ELEPHANT ROCKS.
PRESS AGENT HARRISON DOES
NOT KNOW EVERYTHING.
But Big Liz, the Huge Elephant of
the Main Menagerie, Always
Rocks When She Gets Drunk.
"Harripon, why does that elephant rook
all the time? I have been around here
half an hour, and he hasn't let up a
minute." This from a newspaper man to
Mr. J. D. Harrison, the prince of circus
press agents, with the Walter L. Main
Mammoth Show, who takes care of all
comers connected with the press. "That's
his business," said Harrison, "and you
may say he is onto his job. I have been
keeping tab on him off and on for a num
ber of years, and he doesn't stop for more
than five minutes at a time. Last night
a kid came along, holding his father's
hand. The youngster started in asking
questions when he struck the billboards
outside, and by the time the elephant
corral was reached the old man looked as
though he had been up against the real
thing. First thing the kid pipes out was
that query you made just now: 'Papa.
What makes the elephant rook?' and the
old man took a jerk at his suspenders
and said: 'Oh, he's drunk; run along
now into the circus tent, and don't ask
questions.'
"Of course," continued Harrison, "the
elephant wasn't drunk, but it has hap
pened in my time that the man might
nave been telling the truth. It was when
we were exhibiting in Augusta, Me., last
season, and, owing to the lack of space,
we had to corral the elephants outside
the grounds in a big apple orchard where
a lot of hard cider was stored up in bar
rels in the shade of a big barn. It had
reached that stage when It was pretty
hard for cider and was not quite sour
enough for vinegar: and when Big Liz I
over there got a whiff of it she put her j
foot through the head of a barrel, and in
a jiffy the contents were transferred to
her stomach. Well, say, in about an hour,
when the stuff began to work. Liz was
tied up with a stomach ache and incipient
drunk that was simply paralyzing. She
got out of the tnclosurt) and went tearing |
down Augusta's business streets, spout
ing muddy water through the show win
dows and terrifying everybody. After a
while we caught ber, and it took three !
barrels of strong soda water to sober her
up. I tell you when I first caught sight
of her I felt like throwing up my job.
but, between you and me, that wasn't j
anything to what Big Liz threw up. Go
ask Willie Sells why the elephant rocks.
Ire knows a lot about elephants that he
never tells to anybody."

TEACHERS ASSURED
THEIR SALARIES
AUDITOR WELLS GUARANTEES
THEM PROTECTION.
Bergerot Must Make Affidavit Each
Month That Their Claims Are
Paid.
Auditor Wells and the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Education have
taken a firm stand for the school teachers,
and as a result every pedagogue this year
will receive his or her salary.
At the conference between the Auditor
and the committee, which occurred yes
terday morning. Mr. Wells announced to
the Directors that he would comply with
the law of the last Legislature and fix a
teachers 1 salary fund, based upon the sal
ary expenditure of last year. The com
mittee informed Mr. Wells that the de
partment did not need as much by over
$24,000 as was expended for the purpose
in 1898 and requested him to make avail
able for other purposes the Â¥2tm surplus
which would accrue each month.
\lr Wells replied that he would agree
to* that olan on one condition, and that
was that President Bergerot should file
an affidavit each month that every teach
er had received his or her salary.
The committee at once saw what pro
tection the Auditor's plan would afford .
the teachers and readily agreed. As a I
result there will be something over $2000
each month to be applied to unpaid claims
or other expense.
CADETS AT THE FAIR.
Reception Committee Greeted Colonel
Sullivan and His Staff.
Last night the friends of the League of
the Cross Cadets were present in fuu
force at the Mechanics' Fair at the Pa
vilion and enjoyed a social reception with
the boys. The reception committee of
the board of directors extended a greet
ing to Colonel Sullivan and staff.
The members of the American Institute
of Mining Engineers were present and ex
amined Mrs. Hearst's university plans
and the various exhibits, and especially
the Filipino village, which has become so
popular since hourly lectures have been
delivered on the habits and customs of
the natives. The programme as arranged
for Olympic Club night to-night is an
elaborate one and embraces fencing, box

AN ACQUIRED TASTE

S ator Thurston oi Nebraska says, "I was
:i expansionist," but declares that in arms law is
t, and a civ;', policy for the Philippines must wait
upon the end oi war. Ex Senator Manderson of the
same State goes even further and, after pointing out
that the President is doing his duty now under the
constitution, expressly says that this country can have
no otiier ultimate purpose in the islands short of the
independence and nationality of the people.
Indeed for the strongest expression of the opposite
view one must go to Morgan, Watterson, Scott
Howeil, Denby, Genera! Wheeler, the Democratic
imperialists, and an occasional proselyte, like Senator
Carter.
If the Republican party adopt imperialism it
an acquired taste. The party is mindful of Dewey's
utterances and of General Lawtons latest rep.
expression as to the Filipinos: "It is time for dip
lomacy, time for mutual understanding. These men
are indomitable. All they want is a little justice."
One of the most conspicuous Republican leaders in
the Middle West is Governor Shaw of lowa. A few
months ago he said: "The so-called imperial idea is
one easy to advocate but difficult to defend. You can
go before any audience in the United States and
preach the doctrine of taking all .ye can acquire and
holding all we can get, and meet a ready response.
It i- a very nice sentiment to declare against pulling
down the flag, but it is not, in my opinion, always
the policy to plant the flag wherever chance oppor
tunity is presented." Senator Burrows has shown the
same feeling. Senators Mason, Hale, Wellington and
other Republican leaders have not hesitated to ex
press it, and Senator Hoar is its champion.
The signs multiply daily that the Republican party
does not propose that its position on imperiaJism
shall be dictated by its enemies. In no platform has
it indorsed that policy, and, while some expressions
made in its name are lamentable, tbey are not its ex
pressions. The declaratory resolution of the Senate,
following the ratification of the Paris treaty, is likely
to be the germ of the party's future policy. It will
repudiate the extraconstitutional theories of Denby,
Wheeler and Morgan, and keep in right line with its
history by at once discharging its duty to Republican
principles and observing its responsibility to the
world by nurturing free institutions in the Philippines
and planting there a government which may grow to
be the light of Asia.
It is the duty of good people to strengthen this
party purpose rather than to urge the administration
into a wider departure from it. Christianity cannot
afford the spectacle that would be presented by the
Hawaiians and Filipinos, the only races in the
Pacific Ocean and the Orient that have accepted th?
rule of the Prince of Peace, despoiled of their coun
try and their birthright by those who taught them the
plan of salvation.
If they are to furnish such a melancholy example of
injustice, all Christian missionaries would better be re
called from the far lands where they labor for the
saving of souls, for the difference shown between
Christian precept and Christian practice will be so
great as to make Christianity a hiding and a by
word among the heathen.
If the Christian religion suffer itself to become
merely the forerunner of political conquest, no right
minded man can question the right of civil govern
ment in all unconquered Asiatic countries to rigidly
exclude it as the Western nations exclude anarchy,
nihilism and all cults which come to teach defiance
of the civil authority and deny the right of govern
ment to govern.
From this 6tern and inexorable logic of the situa
tion there is no escape. Emotional appeals to the
impulsive do not answer nor evade it. Recurrence
to the primitive idea of Providence as working its
purposes in the slaughter of the innocent and rob
bery of the unoffending is offensive to common
sense.
Let it be written to be read in the future among
the ruins of a Christianity which weakly identified it
felf with the cruelties of conquest; if these converted
people are defeated in their aspirations born in their
new faith, that faith will not only fade from their
minds, but will lose its influence on the very people
who have used it as a foothold for commercial greed,
territorial spoliation and criminal nergrcs?ion. The
Republican party does not propose to be the agent in
such a downfall.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1899.
HOME EDUCATION AND CULTURE.
ON. Monday. October 16, The Call will begin the publication of a series of papers
designed for the general interest of all readers, but particularly for those who wish
to undertake courses of study either in the privacy of the home circle or in associa
i tion with others. The series will be published every day, except Sunday, and the papers of
: each series will bear such relations as to form an unbroken continuity of instruction from
first to last. The work is to be done under the direction of Seymour Eaton, formerly of the
Drexel Institute of Philadelphia.
The series will include six courses of study. On each Monday and Thursday of the
1 week there will be papers on Shakespeare; on Tuesdays, a succession of articles on the
! world's great artists; on Wednesdays there will be two courses presentedâ studies
, for girls., and shop and trade studies for boys; on Fridays the papers will deal with great
i American statesmen; and every Saturday there will be a study on some subject of home
( science and household economy.
These courses are not to be hastily arranged for idle reading merely. Each will be
! under charge of men of eminence in criticism and education, and will merit the consider
' ation of the most learned and the most thoughtful. To the Shakespearean studies Ed
ward Dowden of the University of Dublin; William J. Rolfe. editor and commentator of
â â  one of the best of recent editions of Shakespeare's works; Hiram Corson of Cornell Uni
versity; Hamilton Mabie, associate editor of the Outlook, and Isaac Demmon of the Uni
versity of Michigan, will contribute. In addition to the leading studies by the contributors
named there will be a number of special side studies of Shakespeare by other writers and
j professors hardly less eminent.
; The course in American history will review the policies and the services of a list of
' sixteen distinguished statesmen, covering the periods of the nation's development from
i trie times of Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry to those of Charles Sunnier. These pa
! pers will be contributed by well-known historians or professors of history in our best uni
j versities. Among them will be such men as John Bach McMaster, Albert Bushnell Hart
I and others. The great artist series will include biographies and critical studies of four
teen of the most noted painters of the world from Titian to Meissonier.
In the department of household economy studies will be given in the home health
ful and beautiful; the buying, cooking and serving of food; the social life of the home,
! and the care and education of children. The leading contributors to the department 'will
|be Mrs. Helen Campbell, Mrs. Margaret E. Sangster, Mrs. Kate Gannett Wells, Miss !
! Lucy Wheelock and Miss Anna Barrows. The course of desk study for girls will include
I instruction in new words and how to use them; correspondence and handwriting; reading
i courses and a girl's library; personal accounts and money affairs, and writing for publica- 1
I tion. The shop and trade studies for boys will include arithmetic of the workshop, draw
| ing for mechanics, arithmetic of the counter and office, money problems and business
records, and machine drawing and design. Each of these courses ' will be under compe
: tent instructors, and the study will be useful practically to all who earnestly undertake it.
;i; In beginning the publication of such a series of papers The Call is not undertaking
a fad. It is but supplying a legitimate demand of the public upon a progressive news
paper. Popular education in America has resulted in producing a community where thou
; sands of people desire to continue to be students as long as they live, and to widen with
j each succeeding year the horizon of their knowledge. From that desire came the estab
j lishment of reading or scientific circles, then the demand for public libraries, next the
I favor shown to lectures on topics- of an educational value. Out of that same desire came
i the growth of the wide-spread Chautauqua Society and the recent movement known as
; university extension, which is doing so much to bring the public* into touch with the I
centers of learning.
The educational series of The Call will supplement all of these studies. They can be
| followed with interest and instruction by all reading societies, Chautauquans and univer
\ sity extension clubs. They are, moreover, more convenient than any of such clubs, be
cause they can be followed in the home itself. They entail no extra cost. They are for the â 
home and the culture of the home, and as such will be welcome to that class of readers
i which The Call delights to serve.
CALIFORNIA MINES FIND MINERALS.
CALIFORNIA MINKS AND MIXFRALS h
the comprehensive title given to an attractive
volume issued by the California Miners' Asso
ciation, under the direction of Secretary Edward H.
Benjamin, -as a souvenir of the meeting in this city
of the American Institute of Mining Engineers.
The contents of the work are as comprehensive
as the title, and the volume constitutes a true com
pendium oi the mines and the mineral resources of
the State. Many of the articles were written by ex
perts who are established authorities on the subjects
with which they deal. The book is in no sense a
"boom" volume designed to attract attention of the
general public, though it might well serve for that
purpose. On the contrary, it is a careful compilation
of the facts of the mining industry r,f the State. It i-;
a volume which will repay the careful study of mining
engineers and mining investors, and will doubtless
receive it from both.
While a. work of this kind, forming a general sum
mary of the whole mineral industry, giving a treat
ment of the subject by counties as well as by the dif
ferent kinds of minerals produced, could not in the
nature of things go much into detail, yet it is to be
noted the articles are in no sense lacking in specific
statement or in as much of detail as is necessary to an
understanding of the topic reviewed. In short, the
work is a really valuable addition to the industrial
literature of California, and will prove of great value
in many v.
Considerable praise is due to the handsome man
ner in which the volume is made up. It is one of the
best specimens of bookmaking ever devoted to an in
dustrial subject. It is printed in large, clear type on
a fine quality of paper, is beautifully illustrated and at
tractively bound. It constitutes, in fact, a souvenir
number worthy of the Miners' Association of the
richest mineral State in the Union.
The story that Cornelius Vanderbilt inherited
$50,000,000 and left a fortune valued at $125,000,000
is hardly correct. There is probably a good deal of
exaggeration in both figures. Still, the increase is
sufficient to show how rapidly vast accumulations
roll up even when the owner does nothing to ad
vance them, but on the contrary spends millions in
the construction of palaces and in the maintenance
of all sorts of luxurious forms of living.
There was a time, celebrated in Gilbertian opera,
when "Queen Victoria ruled the waves." That time
has passed, as Johnny Bull has found when he en
tered the market to secure ships to carry his troops
to South Africa. He found to his sorrow that Uncle
Sam had cornered the market in transports plying
between San Francisco and the Philippines.
Archaelogists are very much excited over the dis
covery of a lot of ruins near Guadalajara, Mexico. At
first they were supposed to be those of a city of the
Aztecs, but fears are now entertained that something
may be found that will connect them with the his
toric, though ill-fated, Baldwin Hotel.

There seems to be reason even for slang. You

The retention of Professor McNaughton as prin
cipal of the State Normal School at San Jose in spite
of the strong protest of the Alumni Association is re
sulting as was expected. The school is in an uproar
and the students, in revolt, declare that they will
strike.
A RAILROAD TO INDIA.
NOT with mighty military armaments and power
] ful navies only are the great nations of Europe
' contending with one another for supremacy.
By granting large subsidies to merchant vessels they
are waging the commercial contest on every sea and
at every port of the globe, and moreover they are
as far as possible constructing railway lines in such
a manner as to be of service to their people in the
industrial competition.
The vast project which Russia is pushing forward
in the establishment of a railway across the northern
part of Asia has stimulated the British to consider
the feasibility of constructing a line to the south
which would bring British India into railway com
munication with the Mediterranean. The franchise
for such a line must of course emanate from the
Turkish Government, as it would have to pass for
a long distance through the "territory of that empire,
and it appears there is now a pretty sharp diplomatic
struggle going on to obtain it.
The objection to the British scheme has come
mainly from the Germans, who for a long time have
been working for industrial and commercial suprem
acy in Turkey and particularly in the Asiatic portion
of that empire. Lately, however, it seems the French
and the Russians have become interested in the mat
ter, and the latter are decidedly antagonistic to both
the Germans and the British, for they are themselves
building a line of railway to the Persian Gulf. The
Vienna correspondent of the. London Times in com
menting upon the situation as presented at the Aus
trian capital says:
"These energetic protests would seem to indicate
that the realization of one of the competing railway
schemes is now looked upon as a not very remote
possibility. Another explanation of the hostility
which finds expression in the Russian press may be
the recognition that in the race to the Persian Gulf
Russia is for the moment seriously handicapped. A
' combination of financial with technical difficulties of
: exceptional gravity will postpone the desired exten
'. sion of the Transcaspian Railway system for a long
time to come. The disinclination of certain foreign
| money markets to make new loans, together with
! the constant and heavy drain upon the Russian
' Treasury for the Siberian Railway, the Far East, and
i the further development of the army and navy, will
necessarily cripple and delay the operations in Per
sia. In ttese circumstances it is quite conceivable
\ that the progress of such powerful and wealthy com
: petitors as Germany and Great-Britain should excite
a little jealousy in St. Petersburg."
It is said the structural difficulties of the road
would be , comparatively slight, and under either
I British or German control it would be easy to ob
tain the money to construct it. It is quite probable,
therefore,. that a new route to India may soon follow
the opening of the Siberian road even if it do not pre
, cede it.

OUR NATIONAL DUTY.
The Question of Expansion and Annexation
of the Philippines.
By FrcmK. H Short.
1 WROTE and published at some
length in December, IS9S, my views
upon the question of the propriety,
advantage and expediency of annex
ing the Philippine Islands. At that
time the presumption was that without
force and substantially by their consent
the Philippine Islands and their inhabi
tants could be annexed and become a part
of our country practically by the consent
of the inhabitants, either as a modified
colonial acquisition or in the shape of
Territories having in view that they
might ultimately become an integral part
of the United States. The situation as it
now exists is much less favorably viewed,
either from a consideration of expediency
or right and justice.
While the San Francisco Chronicle oc
cupies the position of advocating that
the islands shall be annexed as Terri
tories and prospective States, no other
great journal and no leading statesman
has taken this position. So this one paper,
being quite alone in its advocacy of state
hood and citizenship for the Philippines,
it is fair to assume that the question is
now one of granting them independence
or annexing them for colonial purposes
in one form or another. . .;
Since my former article an open rupture
has occurred between this country and
the islands and a continued and aggres
sive warfare has been carried on. So the
present situation is one where we have
purchased the islands and their inhabit
ants from Spain and are prosecuting a
war to enforce our dominion and sov
ereignty, so called, over them. This at
tempt is evidently quite as much against
their consent and will as was the attempt
of King George to continue his sov
ereignty over our colonies, and their op
position is apparently more unanimous
than was ours, because there exists in
the Philippines apparently nothing cor
responding to the Tory party in this
country during the Revolution. *
The maintenance of the position form
erly taken upon this question is more em
barrassing tnan at the time of my former
article upon this subject, for the reason
that at this time we are engaged In an
actual and more or less important war in
which it becomes the duty of every citi
zen whatever his view may be of the
real right or wrong of the controversy
to give his support to the Government
and the army and navy of the Lnited
States, though he may believe and does
believe that the controversy and the war
are unnecessary and the ends sought are
unjust. There is a very radical and im
proper disposition to confound such a po
sition and to undertake to hold all per
sons in opposition to the policy upon tne
grounds of morality and expediency as in
apposition to their own Government ana
its army and navy. The further unpleas
ant complication is that by reason of its
responsible position in connection with
the Philippine question the Republican
party is more or less committed in ad
vance to the policy of annexation, the
continued prosecution of the war and the
further policy of continued domination
over the occupation of these islands; this
latter policy or question being the one
obviously material at this time
The position 1 occupy in this contro
versy is one common with many others
much more prominent in the history and
counsel of the Republican party than I
claim to be. It is therefore of sufficiently
general application to be stated that 1
have no political connections, past, pres
ent or prospective, with any party other
than the Republican party. I be\ieve that
its policies and principles as hitherto
maintained and carried out have been for
the continued advancement and pros
perity of the country along constitutional
and fundamental lines. As founded by
Lincoln and his compatriots it was essen
tially a party of equal rights and civil
liberty to all men of all colors and con
ditions; as matured and subsequently
carried on by Blame and his adherents,
the party is one having equal respect
for civil rights and civil liberty;
its first and foremost principle the doc
trine of protection and reciprocity, the ad
vantages of internal development and
trade as compared with foreign trade and
its consequent necessary dependence upon
international peace and foreign support.
To these policies of the Republican party
I have given my most candid and undi
vided allegiance, have always given it and
now give it the presumption of being
right, unless obviously wrong.
We. have always been taught that ex
cessive party spirit and zeal Is dangerous
to civil liberty and the continuance of re
publican institutions. The predominance
of such a spirit is illustrated by the pres
ent situation. Ther<> can be little question
that if Mr. Bryan had been elected, if the
war had been prosecuted and his admin
istration had adhered to the policy of the
present administration in all of its details,
the majority of the Democratic party would
have been carried with it and would have
now been arrayed on the side of expan
sion; while the Republican party would
have been in practically united opposition.
This is more plainly true when we come
to consider that the acquisition of foreign
territory and the furtherance, of foreign
commerce means an ultimate and inevit
able destruction of the doctrine of protec
tion; therefore the Republican party is
naturally the opponent of the policy of
expansion, and if Here could be any nat
ural support of the policy Its support
could come and come alone from the
branch of the Democratic party ultra free
trade and gold standard. So the fortunes
(if war ar.d of politics have placed the
Republican party where nothing but party
enthusiasm and supposed party loyalty
could have placed it. It is the spirit of
party dominating not only the national pol
icy of the country, but actually subvert
ing the fundamental principles of the
party itself.
So that I may not be misunderstood. I
desire to say that while I stand in un
changeable opposition to the policy of ex
pansion or imperialism, whichever it may
be called, I do so wholly within and as a
member of the Republican party, and
with no thought of allegiance or alliance
; with any other party. Every party has
: many principles and it is hardly possible
that a member of independent mind could
' give full support to every varying prin
ciple of his party. In this Instance the
principle Involved Is of such overshad
: owing importance that fealty and loyalty
j to party does not in my Judgment, and
could not, mean silence or acquiescence.
The policy cannot be the policy of the Re
publican party until it. In its representa-
I tive capacity and in convention, has so
| declared. When this event has transpired,
I as It plainly may and probably will, while
I I cannot and do not expect to give any
1 countenance or support to the policy and
' shall labor as far as I can to assist In re
versing it, overthrowingitand defeating it.
I shall nevertheless do so as a member of
and within the Republican party, labor-
Ing not for the destruction of my party,
but for its return, to those- principles that
thus far have proved sufficient in every
trial, not only, sustaining the party but
advancing the prosperity of the country;
fully realizing in the meantime, however,
'â â  that any party usefulness will '.be im
; paired, and that in order to stand by and
! advocate what I conscientiously believe. I
shall be misunderstood by my political
friend?, and that all political preferment.
i if 'ever .thought of, must be abandoned
I and laid aside.
If the question Involved was one of
mere trade; whether, money should be of
i two kinds or on" kind; whether taxation
' should be of one kind or another; whether
a State should have a little more or a lit
tle less rights as against the general
I Government, a" person might be justified
1 in yielding at least silence and aeaules
cenceto a policy with which he did not
agree; but when the question Is one that
involves the fundamental rights of man.
the -fundamental, objects, duties and obli
! gations of a democratic : form of govern
â  ment, there is no honorable ground for a
â  citizen of the country viewing the matter
, in this light, except to oppose such an in
; novation and subversion of principles with
| all his strength and energy. regardless of
i the resuUs to himself or his party. Dis
respect for the rights of the black m.m
or the brown man lend to ultimate disre
spect for the rights of the white man.
It-Is in this spirit that I further present
.my views upon th Is subject. It is proper
in advance to- say that the declaration
made. early in the history of this country
âalthough Bounding somewhat extreme:
"My country: may she always be right,
but 'always : my country" â Is a true state
j ment of the duties of a citizen of the
United States. Tn proportion to his coun
try's needs It is as much the duty of a
citizen to enlist and serve ;in the" army
and navy of the United States, advance,
protect and defend its fine: at this time,
as at any other time in the history of our
country.^ No policy of rlpht or wrong, no
ouestlon of ; what we should, or should not
do. can be determined by pivinp aid or
i comfort Jto a': foretell : : country - in i time i a
PART I.
war, or in any way contributing to the de
feat of our own armies or to the success
of foreign armies.
I therefore wish to be distinctly under
stood as advocating the support of the i
administration, and so long as the Gov
ernment carries on the war in the Philiu
pines those who enlist are entitled to thÂ«
same recognition and same honor, the I
same loyalsupport irom every citizen, as
would be accorded in any other war. i
While I should vote against every meas
ure looking to a continuance of the pres- i
ent policy, nevertheless so long as the j
war was continued or the policy was en- i
forced I should give every assistance pos- i
sible to the full support of the Govern- j
ment and the full and successful prosecu-
Uon of the war. This much is plain: the
duty of a citizen is always with his coun
try. The further duty is also plain, that
where a citizen does not believo that his
country is on the right side or pursuing
the right policy It is his duty with equal i
vigor to labor for and advocate the return
of his country to fundamental principles â 
and right policy. Take the present situa
tion, for instance, and concede it is the
duty of a citizen to give all the support
outlined to the Government; where the
citizen believes that the continuation and
ultimate establishment of the policy
sought would subvert democratic princi
ples and weaken if not ultimately destroy
his Government, it is then the duty of
the citizen within his country to fight
such a policy with even more determina
tion, if possible, than he would resist Â»
foreign roe; for, while there i.s no appre
hension that any foreign foe can destroy
this country. It is admittedly True that
such a result lies easily with the citizens
of this country.
T â  those cheerfully assuming that lib
erty and democratic self-government can
not" be in any danger we reaffirm that the
old and undisputed aphorism that "eter
nal vigilance is the price of liberty" is
always true, and that this free and dem
ocratic people, with as much facility as
the republics of ancient times, may fritter
away and destroy a democratic Govern
ment even more rapidly than such a re
sult was accomplished In former tlmf-s.
It was never the Intention of any people
to destroy a free Government. They
never thought they were doing so un
til the destruction had been accom
plished; and therefore in this regard the
utmost vigilance should be exercised; j
even the appearance of evil in such a i
direction should he avoided. The pres- I
ent high and haughty assumption that
anything a republican form of govern
ment has done or may do is consistent is
to my mind the most dangerous and un
republican doctrine that could be dissemi
nated.
The expansionists now generally concede
that if. as they state it, the fortunes of
war and the requirements of duty had
not forced the Philippines upon us i
it would be best if we were entirely rid
of the whole problem and responsibility.
As to this idea of being in entire control .
of the situation and nevertheless forced
to assume a position or policy contrary :
to the real interest of the American peo- I
pie, such an assumption should be given
no countenance, and for it I have little :
respect. To the world and to mankind
and human liberty the condition and char
acter of the government in the Philip
pines is of little consequence, perhaps not :
in a very great degree to the Filipinos
themselves, but In the preservation of
this government In Its simplicity and j
purity, the whole world and the whole
future of humanity has a deep and abid- i
Ing interest.
While no one would advocate any cruel
or inhuman policy or disregard of na
tional duty, the assumption that national
duty lies along lines hitherto unfollowed
and inconsistent with our principles of i
government and previous declarations is a
most dangerous and destructive assump- <
tion. The whole contention that we are
carrying on a relentless war out of a
sense of duty to a people that we are
in arms against is so sophistical and il
logical and well known by even ourselves '.
to be false, that it is a shame that so j
frank a people should be driven to or
should resort to such a subterfuge.
It was said, I think. In France during
the Revolution" with great truth., "O lib
erty, liberty, how many crimes in thy '
name have been committed!" And to those j
opposed to the present policy one of the j
most objectionable features is that we ar t 
attempting to enforce our jurisdiction and
control upon an unconsenting people in j
the name of liberty.
The poet wished that the gods could
"some good gift give us to see ourselves ,
as others see us." In this instance we
have practically an opportunity to real
ize the poet's dream if we would avail
ourselves of it. For 300 years and over
the Government of Spain, without the
consent of the governed, has extended its !
jurisdiction to the remotest parts of the
earth. During all these years Spain has
pursued her course of greed and conquest
with the most fulsome pretenses of piety
love and desire for the amelioration of
her subjects. As very forcibly put by
Senator Thurston. when he stood in op
position instead of imitation of her un
lovely policy, quoting the substance of
what he said: "Spain has set up more I
crosses in more countries and under it j
has assassinated more human beings i
than all other countries." We have seen !
her always proceeding in the name of
Christ and under the cross; we have seen
her in his name and under the cross ef
face from the map of the world whole
countries and obliterate and destroy the
Peruvians and Aztecs, bringing poverty,
desolation and death to untold millions
of people, all in the name of the Prince
<>!' IVace and the author of human rights.
and democracy, and under the emblem of '
his rule and in solemn, holy and sacri- :
legious pretenses of christianizing and i
ameliorating the condition of the people '
that they robbed, subjugated and de- j
Btroyed. The cross is dear to every
Christian, and the flag to every Ameri
can and every lover of liberty "through- !
out the world. It does not better an un
christian deed that it is done under the |
cross; it does not improve an undemo
cratic proceeding that it is conducted un- i
der the American flag. The cross is the j
emblem of morality and justice, the flag j
of liberty and law. The cross and the i
pretenses carried on under it deceive no
one as to the greedy purposes and em- !
bitious designs of Spain. The use of I
the flag we love so well and the pretenses
of human and democratic purposes, but â 
faintly believed in the beginning, ?nd !
doubtless to be wholly and practicaliy
unrealized in ihe efld, deceive no one and
cannot relieve us, even in the forum ot
our own conscience and much less in tnt !
judgment of the world from having de
parted from the high plane of humanity
that we have hitherto occupied among the '
nations of the world.
It is said that we mean to givÂ« the peo
ple we subject good and just laws. 1 hope
if this policy prevails that some little of !
this will be realized, but as far <is wo
have gone there seems little to expect r.r
hope for. It is well to remember, exc> pt
from our own point of view, that we are
not much better or worse than others, \
and that in our attempt to solve the race i
problem in the South we have proven
more incompetent to handle and settle it !
than any other question with which we I
have been com'ronted. It is admittedly
true that it is the most perplexing and '
menacing subject with which we are at
tempting to deal, and it would seem an j
unaccountable folly to seek more trouble '
of the same kind existing under more dif- !
ficult conditions.
The expansionists say that we have be
come a world power. If by this it is meant
that we have become a peer of or upon
an equality with the five or six other groat
powers of the world, so called, it is but
the evidence of an alarming retrogression
This country for at least a quarter of a
j century has been the great power of the
world; in the advantages of its position
in its reserved military strength in its'
progress, in its increased financial re
| sources, in the loyalty and intelligence of
its citizens, it has been, and is. inestima
bly in advance of any other power in the
world. To feel elated that this position
of dominancy of one-half at least of the
world, and of great moral influences
throughout the other portion, and of un
questioned loyalty to democratic govern
, ment, has been in a degree, or is to be
substituted for a position of equality
among the imperial powers of the world"
indicates in an alarming degree, if true'
the tendency of the American mind aw.iv
from Americanism and democracy toward
imperial and military power. It is w. 11
to bear in mind that all this argument
has been with ourselves; that we the
beneficiaries, are sitting in this case as
lawyer, judge and jury, and the amount
of argument that we are having with our
selves would indicate that we have a
rather weak caseâ a case that if w<> had
to present to an impartial judge or an im
partial jury would never be presented at
all.
It is historically true that probably no
country or despotic ruler thereof ever un
dertook to extend his Jurisdiction over an
other country or people without asserting
some claim of night and an additional de
sire to benefit, not only his own country.
hut the country and people subje^tM.
Alexander is reputed to have rather terse.
ly put it: "If I have destroyed cities and
countries. I have founded greater." The
Caesars destroyed civil liberty in Rome
as it had previously existed, and thoueb:
they had more than rtoompensf
Roman people by giving th-m an imperial
army and imperial power and the imperial
city of marble, substituted for th
Roman town of wood. But in the light i f
subsequent history the exchange is not
reputed to have been to the advantage or
the Roman people.
If it could be determined In advance
that our purpose in annexing the Philip
! pines was to acquire them as colonial suo
jects and not as prr - s. un
doubtedly we could not do so under trio
; constitution; but since there is no mean:-

; assuming jurisdiction over them without

i the constitution affords little prot
' because it has been constru/a to coi

i not one word or line providing for or

reasons it has been uninteresting to me
to discuss at length the constitutional
question involved.

CORONER'S JURY BLAMES
THE STEVEDORES' FOREMAN
FIXING RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE DEATH OF J. E. BURKE.
Nobody Seemed to Know That the Ex
plosive Formed Part of the
Cargo Handled on the
Sherman.
Coroner Hill yesterday concluded the
inquest Into the cause of the 6<-u-
John ESdmund Burke, the Btevedoro who
was killed last Saturday by the explosion
r(a box of prim*rÂ« that was tx . I
Into the hold of th<Â» Government trans
port Sherman. Only two witnesses were
examined, William Andrews and E. 11.
Patterson. Andrews I* foreman of the
stevedores, and his testimony was to the
effect that the box of primers was part
of what is known as regimental baggage
and was not a part of the general freight,
a large quantity of which was composed
of smokeless powder rifle cartridges. Hi
did not see the box of primers, nor the
package containing them, an it was blown
to pieces by the explosion, so that he
could not Bay whether 'the explosives had
been parked in a cartridge box or j
whether they were in a box used only for
primers.
Patterson, the receiving clerk, did not
see the fatal box and knew nothing of its
appearance. Both witnesses freed thai
primer* were dangerous things to handle,
but neither they nor any of the- other
witnesses examined on the preceding day
knew that the box of primers was there.
Several questions were asked by mem
bers of the Jury to fix the responsibility,
but none of the witnesses knew anything
about the primers, or that they were
there at all. an the jury came to the
conclusion that the foreman did not
exercise sufficient care in inspecting the
packages that were being handled by the
men under his charge. They rendered
the following verdict of censure:
That the said John E. Burke, aged
35 years, nativity Brooklyn, N. V.,
occupation stevedore, residence corner
..Mission and East streets In the city
â ana county of San Francisco, came to
his death at the Harbor Receiving
Hospital in said city and county' on
the 23d day of September. I&D'J,
through shock following injuries; and
we do further find that the said John
E. Burke came to his death from an
: j "xnloslon caused by a box of Drimers
' : . ' "
being loaded on the united States
transport Sherman. We further find
that there wiis no precaution taken
to distinguish between safe and un
safe cargo for the transport. We
further find that R. K. Dunne, chief
stevedore, was negligent and careless
in not distinguishing between safe and
unsafe cargo. We charge him with
criminal negligence. We also charge
the manufacturers of said primers
with carelessness in not marking the
box so it could be distinguished from
a box of cartridges. I. Asch, (fore
man). Albert Ritter, J. B. Forne, Sig

The verdict was approved by the Coro

NEWS FROM VOLUNTEER CAMPS
DISCHARGED MEN
AS THE GUESTS
OF GOVERNMENT
They Will Be Paid at
Once.
1
The men who came home from Manila
are out at the Presidio, or at least there
are a good many of them, and they form
one of the queerest camps that the war
has yet established. They are men dis
charged but still under the wing of the
Government; they are not subject to mil
itary discipline, but they are under the
orders of the officers in charge of the re
cruits, and although they have been dis
charged they must conform to the regula
tions of the post and to the orders of the
officers over them. It Is a camp which
the men may live in or leave, as they
chooseâ a sort of hotel kept by the Gov
ernment, with the discharged men as its
guests.
Not all the men who came in on the
Para are taking advantage of the Gov
ernment's hospitality, however. There are
not more than 400 men there now, but
there will be more before the paymasters
have finished their work. A great many
of the men went at once to their homes
here in the city, and others, who had
some money, sought freedom at once and
did not even Join the parade that passed
up the street or the crowd that made its
way to the ferry building and breakfasted
with the committee of reception and wel
come.
The men came ashore about 8 o'clock,
and the breakfast was not over until after
9. During the meal Mayor Pholan spoke
to the men, the burden of his remarks
being the expression of the hope that they
would make as good citizens, now that
they had been mustered out, as they were
soldiers while in service.
The breakfast being over, the officers
who had come down from the recruit
camp at the Presidio to take charge of
the men formed those who showed a will
ingness to parade into line and marched
them up Market street. There was no
band with the column; two had been
promised and neither had come, so the
men marched in silence except for trie
cheer that now and then would break out
from the people on the sidewalk.
No time was lost by the department in
starting the payment of the men. Four
paymasters were at the Presidio yester
day afternoon and they commenced work
at "once. A pay office was established in
one of the old wooden barracks and the
men were lined up to turn in their papers.
The paymasters are Major George W.
Fishback, Major M. B. Curry, Major S.
Howell and Major G. E. Pickett. Each
paymaster has an office, and each one
uses a certain colored pencil in making
out cards oi identification for the men
whose papers he receives. The papers
of thirty men were received by eacn, pay
master, and these will be figured up before
thia afternoon at 3 o'clock, and then the
men who turned their papers in yester
day will be paid. This morning, however,
a different system will probably be put in
operation. Yesterday the papers or only
thirty men were accepted by each pay
master because thirty men's pay is about (
all a paymaster can figure in a day, par
ticularly when the accounts are so com
plicated as some that the men on the
Para bring home. But to-day the papers
of as many as wish will be accepted, and
these will be figured in order, each man
being told to return for his money at the
time the paymasters expect to have his
account figured, ihe men all have their
papers with them, and they have all been
warned not to lose their descriptive lists
or they cannot be paid. The descriptive
list is a financial statement of the man
whoso name it bears, besides his military
history. It is a transcript of the records
of his" captain in regard to himself, and
it Is the only thing the paymasters have
to go on. If any soldier loses hid descrip
tive list he cannot be paid until he has
secure! a duplicate from his captain,
wherever his captain is. -
The paymasters will be on duty all day
at the Presidio for several days. There
are 924 men to be paid <<!"!. and they ex
pect to be nearly a week at the work-
Each paymaster has bi en allowed J4O,(XW,
but as the men will each draw from $200
to $400 there will have to-be more money
forthcoming before the work is finished.
The Montana regiment expects to be
mustered out on October 17. The papers
of the regiment are in excellent shape,
and it will probably not take that time;
but to avoid the consequences of any de
lays the date will probably be llxed at
the 17th. '
There will be two promotions In the reg
iment, one a battalion adjutant and the
other a captain, there being a vacancy in
Company 11. The appointments are now
being considered by the Governor of Mon
tana, and will be announced In a few
d lt y ls not probable that thÂ« Thirty-first
Regiment will get away from the deten
tion camp cm Angel Island for a week
or ten days yet. There has been a great
,;.ji of sickness in the command aim it
will not be sent away to Manila before
it is considered that the regiment is be
yond the possibility of further- danger.
All the sickness has been traced to the
camp at Fort Thomas, where the regi
ment rendezvoused after being recruited
in Kentucky and the adjoining States.

A SOLDIER'S FUNERAL.
Military Honors in Memory of
Lieutenant J. B. Morse,
Ninth U. S. Infantry.
Under the grass in the National Ceme
tery' at the Presidio lies the body of J.
B. Morse, lieutenant in the Ninth United
States Infantry, who died of typhoid In
Manila. He was buried yesterday with
military honors.
Morse entered the service from this city
when the war broke out as a first lieu
tenant in the battalion of heavy artillery
that was sent from this State. He went
to Manila with his battery, and after sev
eral months of honorable service he was
made a second lieutenant in the Ninth
Regular Infantry, with a commission in
the regular establishment. The distinc
tion conferred upon him was not for long,
however, for while on duty with his com
mand he took the fever and he died soon
after in the Island hospital.
The funeral services were held yester
day in the little chapel at the Presidio,
a building far too small to hold the friends
who came to do honor to the dead. Rev.
John H. Macomber. post chaplain at the
Presidio, conducted the services. They
consisted of the simple burial service with
a few hymns rendered by a choir com
posed of Mrs. Girard, Mrs. Pedlar, Miss
Marshall and Mr. Lucky, all residents of
the post. The organist was Miss Ma
comber, daughter or the chaplain.
Outside the escort and firing party un
der command of Lieutenant Evans of the
Third Artillery was drawn up with the
band from the Thirty-third Infantry and
a caisson drawn by six black horses.
There were also a number of men from
Battery A of the California "Volunteer Ar
tillery, the dead man's old command, and
six sergeants from the same organiza
tion, who acted as body bearers. They
were Sergeant C. B. Sidener, Sergeant
Harry J. Morton, Sergeant J. J. Fitzpat
rick," Sergeant Frank E. McLaughlin,
Sergeant H. L. Auerbach and Sergeant
L. H. Harmon. The pall bearers were
Major Frank S. Rice, who commanded
the old artillery battalion; Captain Denis
Geary, who commanded liattery A,
Morse's old battery; Second Lieutenant
E. L. Admire, Twenty-second Infantry;
Second Lieutenant A. McC. Wilson. Twen
tieth Infantry; Second Lieutenant Rich
mond Smith, Twelfth Infantry, and Sec
ond Lieutenant Willis P. Coleman, Ninth
Infantry.
The procession made Its way slowly
from the chapel to the grave, and the
cfflsson halted almost und^r the flag
which flew at half mast from the staff
in the middle of the cemetery. Among
those who followed with the mourners
were Captain Herbert Choynski, First
Lieutenant Thomas F. Barry and Second
Lieutenant D. J. Keohane of Battery B
of the old battalion. Abner MeKlnley, un
cle of the dead officer; Judge McKenna,
Judge Morrow and most of the officers
of the two Federal courts In this city.
Chaplain Macomber repeated the last
prayer for the dead while standing at the
head of the grave. Three volleys were
fired by the escort, and then Bugler Dev
lin <>f the old battalion blew taps, the
soldiers' farewell. Then the people with
drew from the place and left the grave
to the sexton and his men.

applause. The party spirit is apparent
immediately ion his entrance, and he
clinches his welcome with a new kind of
yell. He finds the profession a boisterous
one and since every healthy nervous sys
tem thrives on noise, he proves a tonic.
An audience always appreciates any little
savor of personal devotion, and so Jennie
Yeamans lingers in the mind a generous
friend who didn't give each of us a pink
simply because she hadn't enough to go
around. She Is very clever, and could if
she would sing the songs of the cafe
chantant in a most convincing way. It
is not well to put your trust In first im
pressions, especially if got at the close of
a programme to the sound of a traveling
audience, and so I think Seymour and
Dupree need to be about four on the list
to be fairly appreciated. Stenson find
Merton could win applause indefinitely.
Stenson, the most ingenuous fraud, has
the technique of foolishness at his finger
tips, and he could scarce find a better
instrument to play, upon than hi expan
sive partner. Such as they are not nu
merous in proportion to the ready wor
shipers. Terry and Lambert show a mu
sical feeling in their work and the latter
is as good a tough girl as Ada Lewis.
That is meant to convey much. Hallen
and Puller have a new sketch and a go (
one; the boys play new selections and
Bright brothers still exhibit their wonder
ful strength of muscle. Next week a
Hawaiian trio do a lyric novelty and
Felix Morris returns to play "The Vaga
bond." CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.

TRANSPORTS ARE
HURRYING OFF TO
THE PHILIPPINES
â¦
Two of Them Sailed
Yesterday
â ââ¢
There will be an exodus of transports
this week. The Grant sailed Monday
afternoon, the Relief got away for Ma
nila at noon and the Rio de Janeiro for
Portland early yesterday afternoon. The
Sikh will sail for Portland this morning.
The troops for- the Rio and Sikh await
them on the Columbia River and they will
sail for Manila early next week. The
Centennial with a cargo of horses will
get away to-day sometime, and the Sheri
dan and Glenogle will sail Saturday.
About three regiments will leave on these
vessels.
The Chinese crew on the Rio de Ja
neiro is working under protest. They
struck for white mt-n's pay as soon as
the transport was painted white, and as
the Mail company will not give in, the
vessel will have to go via Hongkong to
land the strikers and get a new lot of
fireman and sailors. Hitherto the Chi
nese have been glad to get from $25 to
$35 a month in Mexican money, but as
soon as the vessel was engaged as a
transport they made a demand for from
$35 to J. r Ai a month, according to the work
they did; and also insisted upon that
amount being paid in gold. A Mexican
dollar is not worth more than 50 cents,
so the Chinese really asked for an in
crease of three times their old pay and
all because the Rio was under charter to
l/ncle Sam.
All the Chinese on the Rio signed for
the round trip from Hongkong, so they
must work the ship back to that point
whether they like it or not. There they
will be discharged if they do not moder
ate their demands and a new crew will
take the transport to Manila.
Of the transports now in port the Sheri
dan will get away about October 1 and
the Zoalandla and Valencia about Octo
ber 5. The work of getting the City of
Para and Charles Nelson ready has just
begun, and they will probably sail about
October 7. The Hancock will go on Hunt
ers Point drydock the latter part of the
week and will be dispatched as quickly
as possible.
The transports expected here are tbe
Solace, which arrived at Yokohama on
September 18 with sailors from the fleet;
the Tartar, which left Hongkong on Sep
tember 14 with the Twentieth Kansas;
the Pennsylvania, which left Yokohama
on September IS with th^ First Washing
tons; the Newport, which is now twenty
days out, witn signal corps; the Cone
maugh, which sailed from Yokohama on
September IS; the Senator, five days out,
with the Fifty-first lowa, and the Wye
field, four days out, with a few passen
gers. Besides these the Westminster is
now out fourteen and the Port Stephen
seven days from Sydney, N. S. W. ; the
Anglo-Australian. Pak Ling and Moynne
are on the way. while the Olympia. Len
ox and Victoria will be taken just as soon
as they reach Sound ports. The Bristol
is now being overhauled on the Sound,
and as many vessels as possible will be
fitted up outside of San Francisco until
the contractors and boilermakers settle
their differences.
The transports a 1 Manila are thp Ohio,
which arrived on the 19th inst. with the
shipwrecked soldiers from the Morgan
City, the Indiana, ship Tacoma City of
Sydney, Garonne, Athenian, St. Paul and
City of Puel
Thf City of Para docked at Folsom
Btreet wharf yesterday morning and the
soldiers were landed. All day a large
force of cust mis inspectors was engaged
passing the nun's baggage.
All the supplies on the Leelanaw have
been transferred to the Sikh, and the
former will go on the drydock as soon as
ble for repairs.
It's a good thing for men that
women's disposition don't depend on
the fit of their shoes.
The â <Â£% Hotels
The covered passageway connecting these
two immense structures places under one
management 1400 rooms, more than hall of
which have baths attached.
Those who appreciate exclusive clientele,
perfection in cooking, efficient service, and
close proximity to business and amusement
centers can obtain these requirements here.

He Might Have Won at Oak
land-Three Choices Cap
tured Purses.
As the stables keep on arriving at Oak
land track the crowds improve and the
usual good things are beginning: to bub
. bie to the surface. In the opening five
furlong scramble Senator Wilson, a
. . 'Washington bred horse, backed from 30
to 15, gave the bookies some cause for
... uneasiness for a while, but he went the
- way of many others. Negligence, the fa
â¢V vorite, winning easily, and the Senator
ending up In last place. Munsey, practl
â  : cally unbacked at odd* of 7 to 1, and Ex
pedient, once, as good as 15 to 1 In the
.. ring, were the successful outsiders.

' that pave the favorite Negligence any
: . (semblance of a contest. The erratic mare
led into the stretch, but was beaten out
with ease at the wire. I' F took the
show.
Almost any one of the nine starters In
. the seven-furlong run looked to have a
. chance, and in the closing betting there
was no really pronounced favorite,
though Bomis enjoyed a slight call. Jack
,MoCabe, backed from sixes to 7 to 2, was
the best, and after getting away
jioorly n:a around his ileld. hut was un

SHAMROCK SHOWS HER SPEED IN A THIRTY-MILE TRIAL.
THE cup challenger Shamrock was tested over a thirty-mile course last Wednesday and showed she will be no mean
rival to the American yacht She covered for the first time one of the courses of the international racesâ fifteen miles
to windward and back. The time for the thirty miles, taken officially, was 3 hours 2!< minutes. In one part of the
course she covered nearly thirteen knots in an hour. Save for the using of a smaller club topsail, the Shamrock was in
full racing canvas and was pressed to the limit.
brought about by a recently arrived at
: on the part of Sir Thomas Llpton
and the yacht's designer. "William Fife,
that the Shamrock 1h "lit" aloft for the
.Hiiiing contest and thai other tests of
tail and spar would be superfluous.
At "halt-thif" or about half-past 11
O'clock to-morrow the Shamrock will be
docked. Three hours later the yacht will
u e â¢â¢dry," as the ducks pumping engines
are equal to eight f< j et or so an hour.
There may be a surprise when the Sham
i. ck'S form below the water line Is seen.
The keel blocks were laid yesterday, ac
cording to a docking plan furnished by
Mr. Fife. These Mucks show that the
Shamrock's k*-d Is longer than that of the
Columbia and that it has a rocker shape.
The latter is a decided departure from the
usual methods. The Vigilant. Defender
imd Columbia are straight on the bottom
of the keel and early guesses made the
Shamrock The. blocks laid in the dock
at Erie Basin are pretty positive proof
that guessers of last summer regarding
Hi. Shamrock's design were not well in
formed.
The keel of the Shamrock, should any
one be fortunate enough to have the
chance of measuring it, will be found to
be about W feet - Inches from the end of
her lead to the rudder post. Men with
mathematical eyes estimated that the
rocker forward Is about twenty-two
Inches and aft somewhere near three
inches, while, the lowest point of the
r. cker Is about five feet from the rudder
post. From the shane of the boat near
the water the undy body bids fair to be
n series of beautiful curves, such as all
yachtsmen arc familiar with in boats
from the boards of Mr. Fife.
An English yachtsman a month or so
ago. in describing how the Shamrock was
built, said: "There is not wa.t?r enough
:-t Cbiswick Yard to clear the 19 feet 9
inches draught in which the Shamrock
floats, and a yard had to be got further
down the river."
The above iigure<Â» do not tally wfln the
alleged excessive draught of the chal
lenger, which lias given considerable anx
iety to American yachtsmen, and it is be
lieved that the writer Is a few Inches
shost of the correct figures. If one should
Â»idd four or five Inches to the 19 fe^t 0
inches given the curiously inclined will
have the draught of the foreign boat.
ACCIDENT OCCURS TO
THE YACHT COLUMBIA
NEW ROCHELLE, X. T.. Sept. 26.âAn
other accident befell the Columbia to-day,
making the third which the new cup de
fender has met with while at New Ro
chelle. She started down the Sound for a
short spin this afternoon and was out for
two hours. When returning to her moor
irtt.'H and while sailing at a good speed a
bobstay suddenly broke. All the rigging
and headsalls fell to the deck with a
crash, carrying: away the spreaders off
the bowsprit and weakening the topmast.
Confusion reigned. The crew rushed for
ward and gathered In the wreckage, and
the boat made her moorings under the
mainsail. Captain Barr said the damage
â¢was not serious, but It will probably pre
vent the Columbia from going- out for sev
eral days.

KENNEDY
LAID LOW
BY MAHER
California Heavyweight Is
Knocked Out in the
Second Round.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â Seven thousand
persons saw Peter Maher knock out Joe
Kennedy, the California heavyweight, in
the second round in the Lenox Athletic
Club arena to-night. Before the fight the
betting was 2 to 1 on Maher, but his victory
was even easier than his friends had ex
pected. The knockout blow which Maher
delivered was practically a double left
swing and hook on the jaw, following a
right-hand swing on the opposite side of
the jaw. Kennedy fell as if hit with an
ax, and although he was unable to regain
his feet within the allotted ten seconds he
recovered very quickly and walked out of
his corner to his dressing-room within
two minutes after he was floored.
Round Iâ Kennedy was the quicker, and
led to the breast. Then Maher led to his
left on the body and was countered on the
neck. Kennedy cut the pace and they
came to close quarters, both landing.
Maher got first blood with a hard left on
the nose. Kennedy clinched, and was cau
tioned for so doing, but immediately stag
gered Maher with a left on the jaw and
repeated the blow. When Kennedy came
to him again Maher let go his left just
before the bell.
Round I 1 â Both were more cautious and
took things easily. Maher landed a left
on the face, and there was no comeback.
Sparring and fiddling followed, with Ken
nedy trying lefts, which Peter blocked,
and' then Maher put his left on the body
and his right on the face. This last blow
staggered Kennedy, and Maher, seeing
his chance, followed quickly, putting his
left on the face, and then swung his
right and lfft to the jaw with all the
force he hud back of his bie shoulder?,
and Kennedy went down and out. Time
of round, 2 minutes 39 seconds.
In the preliminaries Jack Curley of this
city knocked out Tom Burke of Pittsburg
in the fourth round, and "Kid" Ash (col
ored) of (Cincinnati Rot the decision over
Job Dwyer of this city at the end of a
six-round bout.

, . The second day of the California meet
â¢ ing of the American Institute of Mining
â¢ Engineers, hoi 1 yesterday, was a quiet
.' one. Illustrating well the method and
spirit of this great organization of lead
ers In the world's industrial progress.
.. The meeting moans much to the mining
Industry of the country, and the world as
well, yet it lasted only two hours In the
forenoon, the afternoon and evening ses
sions being skipped ... order that the
park, the Cliff House, Mount Tamalpais,
-.the State Mining Bureau, the State Unl
â¢'. versity and the offices and homes of a few
. .; local scientific men might be variously
â¢. visited.
The average citizen might have called
| â ' .the Tuesday proceedings tame and have
â¢ bmiled at the idea that It was worthy of a
â¢ ' sacrifice â : time and Hospitality on the
'â " part of rtiians, for the crowd in the
small J neatly decorated hall of the Palace
â  Hotel was not large, and there was no
crowding and cheering lobby. But in
â¢ . spirit and in fact that morning session,
into which the whole day's proceedings
â . were . crowded,, was attended by many
~. thousand brainy men, and the audience
will not adjourn for many a year.
After a few remarks by President
Douglas, the formal presentation of val
uabie gifts to the mining industry quietly
proceeded,' and, be It said to the honor
.'. of California, the first three were present
ed L.y men of tnis State. S. B. Christy,
. ueant'f me- college ot mining of the i tu
:.".versity or California and professor of
mining and metaliurgj tnerem, read a
paper on ' Tni- Ji,ieciromotive Force of
. Aietals in Cyanide Solutions." Now, this
paper presented to the world for the tlrst
nine tin.- compactly arrayed results of

lege 01 mining on the results of electric
101 cc on solutions ot various metals In
comoination with cyanide of potassium.
*A"he cyanide process Ib the latest, and in
a considerable degree the most promising,
of the processes lor the economical sepa
ration ot precious metals from base ores,
. and It is one which will in the future cut
a very great feature in the mining indus
try ot -Northern and Southern California,
wnere the ores are not generally suscep
tible to profitable treatment by the or
dinary milling and concentration pro
cesses, which have produced most of the
gold from California s quartz mines.
' In his paper Professor Christy gave in
detail a series of results in the electric
deposition of various metais In cyanide
solutions of greatly varying strens:tn,,and
as the electric process is at tiie bottom
of tne cyanide process tnis paper, wnlch
was illustrated by many graphic dia

known. The author is the son of the well
known Thomas Mem of San Francisco,
manager of this and several other great

MARKET STREET RAILWAY IS FREE
OF SOUTHERN PACIFIC INFLUENCE
THE Market Street Railway system is no longer alto

affairs of the Southern Pacific Company. The con

of street railway affairs.
The whole number of shares of Market Street Railway
company stock is 186.170. The holdings of C. P. Hunting
ton amount to SS.OOO shares. Mrs. Stanford owned until
hares. A short time ago Bhe sold several
thousand shares, which passed Into the hands of San
Francisco men har.ts. Bearles owns 84,000 shares. The num
ber of shares in the estate of the late C. F. Crocker Is 80,
--000. l \v. ii llrnan, Mrs. Parrott, Alvinaa Hayward,
George Crocker and Will Crocker each Â»vrn quite a number
of shares. The Southern Pacific Company, counting the
shares of stock owned by Mrs. Stanford and placing tho
number which she Owns at 20,000, controls onlj 69,000 of the
shares. The number of shares controlled by other
owve'rs is 117,170.
The Call ascertained yesterday that George Crocker's
resignation as a director of the Market Street Railway
system had been tendered. It will be accepted at a Bpecial
meeting of the board to-day or to-morrow. No doubt
Henry T. Scott, one of the executors of the estate of C.
F. Crocker, will b< chosen to fill the vacancy. During the
past two years George Crocker has disposed of nearlj ail
of his street railroad securities. Will Crocker was never a

others kept loyally hustling the present
and future arrangements for the long
season of entertainment in the city and
throughout the State.
The number of members wpo had
voluntarily registered yesterday was
sixty-five. The number of members and
friends who had already registered for
the trips about the State was ninety-eight.
There were probably 100 members of the
institute here yesterday, and doubtless
there will be more than 150 in the party

BENSON SEEMED
OUT FOR A BIT
OF EASY MONEY
Â»
Judgments Against a
' Crazy Man.
â â â ' . ..'" â 
Justice of the Peace Barry uncovered
a case In bis court '-yesterday which places
Attorney P. F. Benson and his Police
Court practices in a peculiar light, to say
the least, If the facts which /are to bi
developed boar out the surface indications
Benson has been guilty of using the ma
chinery of the courts to systematically
rob one Festy O'Donnell of the few hun
dred dollars he hud deposited in the Hi
i ernis Hank.
Benson's system is something unique in j
the line of Police court cYookedneas, it
consisted simply in securing default judg
ment on nil' ged board bills against a man â 
who was mentiflly incompetent to appear
on bis own behalf and whose mental dis
ease made it possible to prevent him em
ploying counseL Thr- default once en
tered. Benson levied attachments on the '
d( fendant'S funds in bank and secured !
possi Ssion of them upon execution.
O'Donnell has been a raving m.ii:i.i
months, but Instead of being .sent to an
asylum wan hidden away in a room of. a .
lodging-house at 803 Natomo street kept ,
by a woman named Winnie McDermoit.
In the lirst suit which was brought
against O'Donnell the McDermott woman"
appeared as plaintiff. Benson, as her at- I
torney, had process served upon O'Don- i
nell In nn action for $So alleged to be due
for four weeks' board and $2 borrowed I
money. The complaint was filed on June
22 of the present year, and was made re- |
turnable before JusticeGroezlnger. O'Don
nell. naturally enough, did not appear,
and on July 31 a default judgment in the
inn amount was entered against him. On
the sam.' day Benson filed papers in an
other action for }V 1 for board from the
IMb to the 31st and fur $12 borrowed
money. The same plaintiff was named.
The rase came before Judge Kerrigan,
who gave judgment by default on August
S. On August 21 another judgment on
still another suit for $o<i was rendered.
On A-Ugust 21 the Sheriff levied on the
funds O Donnell had in thtj Bibernla
t'ar.k. and two sums. $61 35 ana 990%, were
turned over to him by that institution.
'in August 28 he levied again, and re
ceived |77 85. Not satisfied with this
cleanup, Benson appeared in another suit
f<>r one MTTIer upon a claim for jiivi fur
board and $M) for borrowed money, as
signed by Winnie McDermott to plaintiff.
It was in this suit that Benson over
rveacbed himselX. Emboldened by his pre
vious sue* esses, he demanded that de
fault judgtho.nl be at once entered, and
iv ObjUtiiftO wiiiu-.=ses who appeared in a
manner that Justice 1 lurry would not
brook. Becoming suspicious of the ease,
the Judge started an Investigation and
found the :'.. ts an set forth. He at once
refused to enter judgnx nt or to have any
thing further to do with the case until
CP Donnell was represented in court by
either an attorney or guardian. Benson,
when he saw his game was discovered,
set upon the young l>oy from whom Barry
pr>t his information and abused him until
ordered "in by the court.
Whether or not any action will be taken
against Benson ana hla clique cannot be
s.-ti'l. i!s O'DonnelJ is so badly gone that
he cannot lie tnnde to understand any
thing connected with the ca.se. and up to
dat< none of liis friends have presented
themselves.
STORY OF THE MINES.
The Souvenir "California's
Mines nnd Minerals."
"California's Mines and Minerals" was
given by the press yesterday to the min
ing world, arid it will long remain a nota
ble feature of the mining literature of
California.
When the meeting of the American In
stitute of Mining Engineers of the fall of
IS!>9 was secured for California, mainly by
E. H. Benjamin, secretary of the Califor
nia Miners' Association, Mr. Benjamin
conceived the Idea of publishing, in the
name of the association, a book giving an
exposition of the State's mining industry
and mineral resources, to be presented to
PERRAULT AND

WITH CROCKETT
Another Dark Night
the Result.
GAS MAN MAY RELENT TO-DAY
REFERS WHOLE QUESTION TO
HIS DIRECTORS.
The City Plans Retrenchment That
Will Pay Back Bills But Will
Causs Five Dark
Nights.
Mayor Phelan, J. B. Crockett, president
of the San Francisco Qas and Electric
Company, and Supervisor Perrault, chair
man of the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors, met in the Mayor's
| office yesterday morning for the purpose
of arriving at some agreement which
would throw a little light In the city's
dark corners and make the public high
ways safe to travel upon by night..
Up to a late hour 'last night, however,
they had not adjusted the difficulties, and j
the city was again as dark as a pocket. !
As a result of the conference Mayor Phe- j
lan made public the pleasing intelligence
: that though no absolute agreement had
been entered into with the gas company,
Mr. Crockett had "practically agreed"
, I that the street lights would be aglow !
! again this evening. Mr. Crockett, how- j
| ever, qualified his pledge with "the proviso
i that the directors of the. gas company
â¢ ! should authorize him to carry it out and
i turn on the "glim."
The basis of settlement offered by the
Mayor and Chairman Perrault was set
! forth in a letter to Crockett by Mr. Phe
i lan. Mayor Phelan's plan Is to pay the
back bills, but this will necessitate five
dark nights each month. The letter was
as follows:
Sept. 26, 1899. !
Mr. J. B. Crockett. President San Fran
; cisco Gas and Electric Companyâ Dear Sir:
Pursuant to the promise mad*' at the con-
I ference this morning, we write you making
I a suggestion as to public lighting. Two, '
hundred and forty thousand dollars has
been appropriated for the lighting of streets â 
! during the fiscal year, which la $20,000 a 4
month, or $60,000 for three months. Your
j July bills are $23,057 7S; August bill, *20,
--â 930 38; September bill. Including four more â 
; nights for this month beginning and lnclud
â¢ ing to-morrow night, $17,248 92, making a â¢
total of fC1.237 03. or $1237 03 in excess of
the $60,000.
We propose that during the next three
months, October, November and December,
1 a sufficient number of lights be cut off tem
porarily to make up the $1237 03, and our
suggestion is that. In conference with the
Gas Inspector, you agree upon the lights
anil the time as to when that amount
shall be made up, which no doubt can be
â  amicably arranged. In that event your
bills for July, August and September, ag
gregating as above $01.237 03, will be ap
proved by the Finance Committee and
I ordered paid. â¢.:':'
As per compromise agreement It was
understood in the conference held In my
office that you pledged yourselves to bid on
the new contract for gas and electricity
a rate not in excess of that now paid,
which is the compromise rate. We find
that you hare bid 11 cents per lamp per ;
! night for gas Instead of the present rate,
1 which Is the compromise rate, viz, 10 cents
i per lamp per night. At the rate of $1 35
: per one thousand, allowing for main
tenance, we figure that a fas lamp should
j not cost the city more than 8% cents per
' lamp per night, but we. In behalf of the I
city, are willing to stand by the com- i
promise rate and trust that your directors
I â¢ will respect the agreement then made.
There has been $240,000 appropriated for the
lighting of public streets, and that Is all
you can possibly get for the fiscal year and I
it la all we can give. , By carrying out this
â¢ agreement to which we refer, the city will
be ax well supplied with light for the en
suing year as the appropriation will afford,
i ' and In our judgment you will be amply
compensated for your service and we will
nee to It that your bills are promptly paid.

the leaders of the industry. President !
Xeft Vice President Ralston and a num- I
I ber of members of the executive commit- \

the plan, and the enterprise proceeded
under Secretary Benjamin's direction.
The result is a work of 508 pages, which
is one of the handsomest books produced
by a Pacific Coast publishing house. It
Is appropriately bound, in uniformity with

shelved, and the typographical and other
mechanical features of the work are ad
mirable examples of the best which the
publisher's art produces.
There has been a vast amount of in
formation about every feature of the Cal
ifornia mining field scattered in a great
many State and Government reports, in
: proprietary books and in papers and pe

$5000 and the expense has been borne by:
a few advertisements supplemented by
subscriptions by enterprising members of ;
the association. The first edition is, one
of 3000 copies and one copy is to be sent
free by mail to each of the 2600 members ;

The New York Commercial says:
"The week opened dull so fax as actual trafl
ing was concerned, but there was more Inquiry
in all lines, and the prospect of an early re
sumption of business la encouraging. In me
lines conditions are still uncertain, but the
tendency Is toward improvement, and holders
are confident of increased prices on some, with
great activity in all varieties.
"Prunes are attracting more attention,
though up to the cl< Be yestfTday no Important
deala had been consummated. Sales are llm-
Jted to carlotÃ, with here and there a buyer
taking two or even three cars. Western buy
ers re reported to be : rating more exten
fcively, principally because they have accepted
what appears to be the Inevitable, and are
paying the prices asked. There will be Prunes
enough to go around, but apparently large and
email sizes will both be short, and there is
some special demand or both of them.
"Peaches are weak and prices are irregular.
No one wants to make an offer "or a large
block, because the chances are strongly in
favor of its acceptance, and it is unsafe to
make any predictions ling the trend of
prices In the future. The lure of packers
to secure cans has caused a much larger quan
tity to be dried, and that has demoralized
the market.
"Apricots are firm, with exporters about the
only buyers. Domestic handlers are not tak
ing'large quantities, and are offering low prices
lor what they do want. Holders are confident
of the future, and refuse to make concessions
even to prospective buyers of round lots."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26. â The stock market
continued dull ami listless in character to-day.
Several favorable Incident! Imparted an under
tone of strength and discouraged operations for
a decline-, but the soaring tendency of the
money rate waged all speculative demand
on the one side and the day closed â with nearly
all stocks showing a loss. The Incident that
attracted much 'attention was the engagement
in London of $1,000,000 for New York. Prices
rose to the highest on this announcement and
for a number of stocks reached a level above
yesterday's close. Money, however, rose up
ward by quick stages to 20 per cent, and the
heaviness of the market wan renewed. The
gold engagement In the face of firmness of
exchange is obviously based on the expectation
that the money rate will continue high until
the receipt of gold here,' when the profit of
the loaning rate may make good the loss in
volved In the simple importation. The course
of the local money market to-day contradicts
the assertions made yesterday that the higher
rate was due to manipulation. The present
and prospective condition of the money market I
is undeniably tight. Rates advanced not only i
here but at other domestic points' both East j
and West. New York exchange at other points
shows continued pressure on this center. The
announcement that more gold is on the way
from Australia to San Francisco had no effect,
the promised relief being so remote. The fact
of a three days' holiday approaching had its
influence also on the prevailing dullness. ThÂ«Â»
â weakness on foreign stock markets was an la
fluence here only indirectly and so far as It
â¢was deterrent to gold Imports. The series of
railroad statements which appeared to-day was
a real and effective prop to the market and
undoubtedly Induced some good buying from
substantial interests, such as are not dependent
on borrowed money. The overnight statement
of st. Paul for the third week in September,
showing an increase of last year's unprece
dented level of 152,000, led the list. Even more
striking was the . statement of the Atchison
system for August, showing an Increase in
the Income from operations of $705,893, a result
in large part due .to the heavy decrease In
operating expenses.: In the cases of Erie and
the Southern Railway, In spite of liberal in
crt-asfs in operating expenses, there . was an
increase In net earnines for the former of
$221,382 and for the latter of $180,375. Business
on all trunk line* was reported on an un
precedented scale. These facts' gave the
undertone of firmness to the â  market. ' the
Stocks especially affected being those whose
reports were published. The day's net de
clinr-s reached a point In only a few
cases. A number of the industrial special
ties were nt one time 1 to 3% points below last
night's price, but covering by the shorts worked
a partial rally. Brooklyn Transit continued '
very active, though American Tobacco ex
ceeded it and was well sustained after an early
line, rising to a point over yesterday and
closing with a net gain.
The bond market was dull and prices were
lower. Total sales, par value. $1,320,000.- United
States 2s advanced V old 4s (coupon) ; % and
the new 4s % In the bid price.

Chicago Wheat Market.
| CHICAGO, Sept. 26.â Opening prices In Wheat
Showed practically no change from yesterday's
closing figures. Trading was light at first
with the professional element Inclined to sell
on the theory that the recent advance had
about reached its climax, while commission
houses had fair buying orders from the coun
try. Early statistical news was decidedly
â  bullish, and soon after the opening, a marked
falling off In offerings took place, with an in
crease in the demand and a fair advance re
sulted. Some nervousness was shown by Sep
tember shorts and the spread between Septem
ber and December widened at one time to l%c.
Humors were current of a squeeze In 'Decem
ber and an Increase of only 443,000 bushels in
contract stock tended to increase the uneasi
ness of shorts. Nevertheless the professional
i element continued to sell and though offerings
were â¢ well absorbed for some time the short
selling and profit-taking ultimately weighted
down the market and In the afternoon prices
slowly declined. Bradstreets report on the.
1 world's visible made the increase 3,354,000
bushels. This was much larger than looked
for and the market soon after Its announcement
i became heavy, with increased general selling.
Liverpool was strong and 'â¢.'u : higher. This
i had considerable Influence on the early
i strength. December opened a shade lower at
73V't&73%e, advanced irregularly to 73V4c and
later declined to 73c, closing at that price.
September sold between 74c and 75% c and closed
%c lower at 74c.
Corn was quite active. The market early
â was strong, principally in sympathy with
Wheat. â  There was .plenty of Corn for sale,
holders of December and May especially tak
ing profits. But September was offered liberally
at 3f>c by concerns supposed to be big holders.
Prices gradually declined late In the session
' under liberal selling. December â  closed %c
! lower at 30c. September closed %c lower at
34% c.
Oats in a general way followed other grain
markets with a good trade. Early an advance
; took place on a good general buying, but later
profit-taking, which started when other mar
-1 kets turned downward, resulted In the loss of
| all the gains.
Provisions in the main were , firm, witn fair
'â  trade. Heavy sales of Lard for export were
reported, which made packers large buyers of
October product and resulted In a steady mar
: ket all around. There was a disposition to
sell January on the small rallies. Liverpool
reported 6d advance on Hams and Bacon. Janu
ary Pork closed unchanged at $9 75: January
Lard 2%<{?nc higher at fa 55ifj5 57%, and Janu
ary Ribs 2%e lower at $5 10.

SIMONS FILES
A SENSATIONAL
DIVORCE SUIT
Sues Widow of Late
Charles Kramm.
Oakland Offlci San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Sept. 26.
. A sensational divorce suit was flled In
the Superior Court to-day by Anthony
Simons, the well-known mining man,
against Augusta Simons, who before mar
rying him was the wealthy widow of the
late Charles Kramm Sr., the brewer.
The grounds stated in the complaint,
â¢which was prepared by Attorney J. J.
Bcrivi are cruelty and desertion, and
the trial of the suit promises to create
a stir in the local German colony.
Simons was formerly a part owner in
the Anchor Brewery at Temcscal, which
is now owned by Councilman Charles
Kramm Jr., and his three brothers. In
May, 1535. the widow of the brewer
created considerable surprise by announc
ing' her intention of embarking once more
on the sea of matrimony. She had but
shortly previous engaged Slgnor Peano,
a local sculptor, to fashion in bronze and
gold a bust of her late husband, Charles
Kramm. which had been duly installed
in a prominent niche in the parlor of her
home, and during the same month she
married Simons.
Both parties owned considerable prop
erty and their joint Worth was estimated
at over $100,000. Mrs. Krumm-Simons'
eons, ranging in age from 16 to 22 years,
were opposed to the match from the very
beginning, but their protests proved of no
avail.
The season of marital bliss, however,
ran smoothly for about eight month and
then, according to Simons' complaint, the
wife began treating him harshly and in
humanly, and the sons, who are physical
giants, did all in their power to make life
miserable. Simons charges that the sons
had conspired to bring a bout the rupture
between himself and their mother, suc
ceeding finally in turning: her against their
stepfather.
On one occasion, recites the complaint.
Henry Kramm, one of the giant stepsons,
broke into plaintiff's room at the Krtmm
residence. 314 Telegraph avenue, and as
saulted him. June S. 1597, is set down as
the date of another assault with his wife's
approval, and on that occasion plaintiff,
who was suffering from a broken leg, had
Henry arrested, and the latter was fin^d
Jo.
In the following March Simons went to
Alaska in search of more fortune. Wh<^n
he returned eight months later his "wife
slammed the door in his face and told him
to get out, b?cause she wanted no more
of him."
As his second cause of action Simons
alleges that in March, 1898, his wife de
serted him. He asks the court for a de
cree of divorce, and that property, located
on Grove stroot. which he avers he pur
chased subsequently to the marriage, be
deeded to him, and for $500 attorney's
fees and costs.
The summons in the suit was promptly
served on .Mrs. Simons this afternoon by
Deputy Constable Sullivan, and it is whis
pered that sh*> will file a warm answer.
Some of her friends say that she had to
use her own funds to support herself
after marrying Simons, and that the lat
ter refused to spend any of his money,
but had married her solely to get a
whack a: tier fortune.

YOUNG GRAPE-PICKERS
DECLARE A STRIKE
OAKLAND. Sept. 26.â The school chil
dren employed in grape picking at Liver
more have struck for more wages. They
demand an increase of 33 per cent in the
price paid for picking. They have been
paid $1 50 a ton and they demand $2. A
number of the young toilers held a meet
ing and decided to act In harmony. They
notified their employers that they would
not work longer and returned to their
homes.
So long as the picking was good the
children earned fairly good wages, but
now the grapes are so scattered that It
is impossible to earn enough to pay the
children to work. The strike began on
the Mont Range vineyard, owned by
Charles Bon, and It may become general.

. f^i AKLAND, Sept. 86. -If Miss Josie Galloway intends that the aristocrat

* has taken advantage of a legal technicality to fight that balance of $20.
5 Before Judge Quinn to-day the case came on for trial. Attorney Goodsell
â¢ appeared for the plaintiff and Attorney G. Russell Lukens represented himself.
* Mr Goodsell outlined the case. In the heat of the last campaign the Fifth
. Ward Republican Club, which includes many semi and more reputed million
' aires decided to do something noteworthy, It would have a poem, essay and
* cartoon compel The idea was highly approved by the club, and the con
' ditlons of the contest were published.
â¢ D Edward Collins, the banker, Rev. J. W. Ellis and Attorney G. R. Lukens
. were appointed a committee to award the prizes. Many members contended
â¢ that honorary mention was all the prize that any competitor could expect,
Â° but Mr Lukens said It would bo necessary to give money prizes, as brains
* would not wort for nothing. So prizes were awarded, and Mr. and Mrs. Lou
* don and Mrs Josie M. Galloway were declared the winners. The successful
* cartoon was exhibited all over the city, but after the Republican majority

Â° ners They forgot to pay for nearly a year, and finally the distinguished

D Attorney Lukens refused to admit the facts and also refused to consent to
5 a brief postponement to enable the plaintiff to subpena Rev. J. W. Ellis.

DR. TEBBETS MUST NOW
ANSWER HIS ACCUSERS
Formal Charges Are Prepared and Are Ready
for Presentation to the Governor.
The Scandal in the State Board of Dental Examiners Was an
Affair of Common Gossip in the Fraternity in
This City-Efforts to Suppress Facts,
The scandal in the State Board of Dental Examiners has at last reached a climax. Formal
charges agatnst Dr. F. F. Tebbets will be signed this morning by Dr. Louis T. Cranz, and will be mailed
at once to Dr. G. S. Bachman, president of the Board of Drntal Examiners, and to the Governor. These
charges will allege that Dr. F. F. Tebbets has used his official position corruptly to sell examination ques
tions and to grant dental diplomas. No specific instances of alleged corruption will be recited by the ac
cused, but Dr. Cranz, through his attorney, Thomas D. Riordan, will announce himself as ready to pro
duce witnesses and testimony at the investigation which is demanded. The affair has excited the dental
fraternity of the State, and the Governor will be asked to make an immediate inquiry. Dr. Bachman will
not now be in a position to plead that he has no official knowledge of the charges, and as president of the
State board he will be forced to take cognizance of them. As soon as the Governor receives the for
mal charges he will announce his policy.
Dr. G. H. Gazarian, an Accuser of Dr. Tebbets.
DR. CKANZ was not slow yseterday |
in consulting with hla attorney.

In the ma lity. L>r. Crahz
hnJ Thomas D. Riordan determined there
fore to lose no further time. The evi
ls at hand, the wltnc ssea are ready,
the persona: and pn fessional honest;, of a
officer have been questioned, and
f.>r the sake of the entire profession an
investigation has beoon salty.
It was found Impossible yesterday to fin- j
lull the charges in their formal way in
time to mail them to the- Governor and
to the pr. Lhe Stati Board of
Dental Examiner*, The documents will
be signed by Dr. Cranz this morning, and â 
will be immediately mailed. It is within
the Governor's power to determine what
character the investigation shall take.
Some members of the Board of Exam- |
iners believe that the board should not
undertake the inquiry. The scandal has ;
assumed such wide proportions that these i
members believe that suspl a been j
cast over their own feputatic noth
ing should be left undone the
matter to the very bottom. . evident
reluctance of Dr. G. S. Bachman to take
any action has excited adverse comment, j
but prominent nn-n in the dental profes- j
Pion insist that it is due to the entire fra
ternity to locate and punish the guilty
persons -and free the others from an un-
Juet suspicion.
There is an evident disposition on the
part of professional friends of Dr. Teb
bets to suppress the facts, but develop
ments have come so quickly that the ef
fort has. proved hopeless. This disposition
has been shown by men who are members
of the State Board of Dental Examiners,
b~ well U seme that are not. That Is one
reason why the suggestion has been made
that the inquiry should be held exclusively
by the State board.
As an evidence that some strange influ
ence is at work to throttle an investiga
tion and prevent the whole truth of the
Dental Board's rottenness from becoming
public, the attitude Of Dr. J. 1... Asay of
the faculty of the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, is Interesting. After depre
cating the crookedness in the board, after
resigning, as be stated, because he found
himself helpless to do what he though".
was right, and after taking an enthusias
tic hiterec' in the impending investigation
and promising to add his testimony to es
tabllsb the guilt of Tebbets, he has sud
denly suffered h must aggravated case of
"cold feet." In attempting to squirm out
Of the position into which he voluntarily
Btepped he has involved himself in a hope
tangle of contradictions and incon
sistencies. In an interview last night Dr.
Asay said:
"] dens that 1 ever paid Dr. Tebbets
any money for securing a certificate for
a young lad;, or any other person. 1 Ob
ject to having my name used In this
â  â  ctlon, as one of the faculty of Phy
b and Surgeors. It gives out the
ides that we are all â  lot of boodlers out
there. 1 will not deny that I had a young
lad\ friend who took the examinations.
I will not deny that Tebbets approached
me with the information that certain
members of the board were opposed to
granting certificates to women. I will
not deny that he said he could 'fix* the
matter for me. I have consulted an at
torney and I have nothing .to say on
these points.
"This matter is not going to end here.
Before I get through others will be drawn j
into this thing, and Cranz will be sorry I
that he ever stirred up this mess."
And these statements are made within !
twenty-four hours after Dr. A6ay visited I
Dr. Cranz, assured him of his support !
In exposing corruption in the State ,
itoard of. Dental Examiners, and out- j
lined the testimony he would give at
avestigation as published in yester- ;
day's Call.
While neither willing to deny nor affirm
that he knows Dr. Cranz or that he :
visited iii:- office, Dr. Asay says that if
such a visit was made it wjs fur the j
purpose <jf telling L>r. Cranz a number :
"f uncomplimentary things about him- ;
self and cautioning him not to mix the
Asay name in the Dental Board scandal, j
under penalty of severe punishment po
litical and otherwise.
A representative of The Call was pres
ent in Dr. Cranz's office on the occasion
of Asay'a visit, and at that time there i
were do indications of hostilities.
Dr. Asay sent The Call a signed com
munication last night denying, in an
evasive way, that he had paid money to
Tebbets for a certificate fur his young j
lady it;
Dr. \\. Z. King, who has offices in the
Flood building, is in possession of much \
information to corroborate and strengthen '
the statements made by Dr. G. H. Q-aza
rian, the Armenian of Fresno, wnom
Tebbets be.gst-d to put a plaster on his !
ranch so that he could raise the where- I
with with which to do business with the
Tebb*ts question bureau. Dr. King re- j
members well the circumstance and of!
Dr. Gazarian's statement made to him
upon the very day Tebbets held him up to
grease his Itching palm.
"I remember Gazarian very well," said
Dr. Kin? yesterday. "I took pity on him.
He seemed to be a very decent fellow,
well educated, but laboring under the dis
advantage of not being able to read and !
write the English language very readily.
Sympathizing with him I went to the
pr< -idetit of the State Board of Dental
Kxaminers and secured permission for i
him to take the examination through an !
interpreter.
"\\ iien it was all over he came to me i
very much downcast. He said that he had :
been refused a certificate 1 , although his
examination had been satisfactory, and
then, in the presence of Dr. Metralf of
Sacramento, told the story of attempted
extortion precisely as related In this
morning's Call. ,
"1 never discussed the matter with Teb
bets and the 4 assertion that he admitted
to me that he had 'men doing crooked i
business en the board is not correct."
1 >r. King made no effort to conceal the
impression that his opinions of the ac
cused were not the most favorable:
Dr. George R. Harris is decidedly un
nerved at tha publication in The Call of |
Ids corresponden.ee with Covington rela
tive to the possibility of purchasing from
Tebbets the list of questions to be asked
at the examinations given by the State i
board. He thinks the thing is going too
far and asserts that the whole business j
mystifies him. He insists that he can
explain every statement in his letters to
Cuvington. and yet shows no inclination
to do so. When seen at his home in Oak- :
land, Dr. Harris said:
"This thing Is going altogether too far. \
Those letters contain nothing that cannot;
be easily explained. 1 want to deny at I
the outset that I have ever taken part in
any illegal transaction or that 1 attempt- 1
ed to pass my examination by unfair |
means.
"The Chinese and Armenian I men- '
tloned in my letter were first brought to
my knowledge by Dr. Drucker. I was in !
my laboratory some months ago. talking i
with Dr. Covlngton and others, when Dr. :
Drucker came In and told us he had heard
that a Chinaman had put up $1000 to Teb
bets to be allowed to pass the examina
tion and that ar Armenian had put up
$200. Several times after that I heard the
same thing from different sources and I
concluded that there must be something
in It. Of course. It might have been cir
culated by somebody to hurt Tebbets. I
certainly have never told Dr. Metcalf that j
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, AVEDNKSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, I*H9.
T knew that T was doomed because 1
would not instruct a boy Dr. Morffew
sent to me. About six months ago Dr.
Morffew did ser.d me a boy, and I de
i elined to take him In my laboratory, as I
had neither the time nor the Inclination
to t^ach him. At that time Morffew was
a member of the State Board of Dental
Kxamir.ers. but he was not a member
at the time 1 presented myself for ex
amination. 1 do not believe Morffew
would attempt to queer me because I
; would not t;ike his boy. I did not pass
j my examination, but it was for the rea
-1 son 1 liave stated and not because I did
, not receive questions for which I had
paid. This thing is a mystery to me.
s. mebody Is running very close to the
danp>r line, and when I have satisfied
myself just what it all means I shall do
some talking myself."
Dr. Harris has a wrong interpretation
of th" tffetcalf-Morffew incident. It is
not claimi d that Harris told Metcalf that
he (Harris i was doomed because he had
refused to take in Morffew's client. The
statement is that Dr. Metcalf imparted
this information to Dr. Harris.
STOPPING COOLIE IMPORTERS
F. A. Reeve, acting solicitor of the
treasury, has just handed down a de
cision that will debar from admission to
this country a large number of Chinese
persona who have pained admission
hitherto on the ground that they were
ministers of the gospel, missionaries,
8, lawy â¢!â -. etc.
The opinion is to the effect that there
is no authority for the rendmtssion of
â¢ 'hir.ese persons who are neither of the
exempt Vlassesâ returning merchants or
returning registered laborers.
In the month of May of this year
Collector Jackson of this port admitted
Pong Fang, minister. Fond Ting Yuen,
pr< acher and Wcrig Fang Wan, mission
ary, on the ground that they were former
residents of this country "of the exempt
class, not laborers." on evidence satis
factory to the collector, but not furnished
to the Secretary.
The opinion goes on to say that the
Collector says he admitted them on th*>
ground that they were former residents
ot the exf-mpt class, not laborers, upon
evidence satisfactory as to that fact.
"If he means by this that the evidence
was to his satisfaction that Pong Fang
was a minister, that Fond Ting fuen
was a preacher and Wong Pang Wan waÂ«
a missionary, still the legal question re
tQalned as to whether, under the Chinese
â¢ xihision act, :nii:isters, preachers and
missionaries were exempt from their pro
visions. 1 am of the opinion that minis
ters, preachers anil missionaries, as well
as lawyers, doctors, etc., are not of the
exempt class, and I am furthrr of the
opinion that if they were admitted with
out lawful authority they could acquire
no ripht to r>'admlssion to this country
when they return from China."
MILLIONAIRE BRADBURY DOES
HIS BIT IN THE COUNTY JAIL
ONCE upon a timeâ and this is no
fairy taleâ Millionaire \V. B.
Bradbury literally spat upon one
of the ordinances duly made and
prov|ded for the government of the
people of San Francisco. He was ar
r. steel Instanter and found guilty of a
misdemeanor, but it was not until
yesterday afternoon â more than two
years after ho had cxhihited his
ability to shoot snllva at a mark that
fie began to serve the sentence im
posed. He will be released from cus
tody at 11 o'clock this morning, duly
chastened, it is hoped.
It is not every day, even in this city,
th.-it one can find a millionaire doing
time, and, naturally enough, any num
ber of people called at the Broadway
jail last night in the hope that they
might be allowed a glimpse of the
iraseiWe capitalist. He had forestalled
their curiosity, however, by giving in
structions to his jailers to inform
visitors that he was not in. He was,
nevertheless, and it was plain he did
not like it.
The act for whloh Bradbury put in
the night in jail was committed early in
May. 1597. The Board of Supervisors
had just taken occasion to pass an
ordinance against expectorating in
public buildings, on sidewalks or
streetcars. On the ill-fated day of his
arrest Bradbury was riding on a cable
car. On the floor of the car a fly was
crawling. The temptation was too
much for the millionaire. He puckered
and missed the fly, but hit the floor.
The conductor saw the expectoration
and remonstrated with his "fare" for
violation of the ordinance. Bradbury
said some cutting things about the
ordinance, the cable company and the
conductor and said he would expec
torate when and wherever he chose.
The conductor warned him not to
repeat the act. This was like throwing
B red rag to a bull. To show his in
dependence of conventions. Bradbury
spat again. The conductor said noth
ing until he sighted n policeman, when
he lodged a complaint against the mil
lionaire. In the Police Court a few
days later Bradbury was found guilty
by Judge Low and sentenced to twen
ty-four hours In- the County Jail. Hl3
attorney appealed from that Judg
ment, basing it on the ground that the
law provided for a fine as an alterna
tive and the Police Judge had not
recognized that provision.
Pending the decision â¢ of the appeal
Bradbury was released on bail and
nothing more of him was heard until
the following September, when he was
arrested for battery. The aged mil
lionaire had so allowed his fiery tem
per to get the better of him that he
had kicked a piano tuner downstairs
in his hotel. A Jury took Just six mm

ANDREW MARTIN
WEDS MISS GOAD
Elaborate Noon Ceremony
at the Home of the
Bride.
Yesterday at noon, in the presence of a
large company. Miss Genevfeve (Joad and
Andrew Martin stood before the Rev.
Father Prendergast, and after him pro
nounced the woids that made them man
and wife.
It was an impressive ceremony amid
elaborate surroundings. The elegant
family mansion of the Goads on Washing
ton street was given over completely into
the hands of a famous London florist,
who converted the spacious apartments
and magnificent halls into a fairy-like
floral bower. Variety was the keynote
of the Londoner, and the result was a
series of different though most enchanting
effects.
The hall was beautiful with autumn
leaves and American beauty roses; the
reception room was like an enchanted
spot in which great palms and white
blossoms flourished, and the dining hall
was ablaze with autumn foliage and
hop blossoms. The small tables, at
which the elaborate breakfast was served.
were decorated with prnk and yellow
roses, with the exception of the bride's
table, which was a picture of floral loveli
ness with Its decoration of white orchids {
and violets.
In the drawing-room, where the cere- ,
mony was performed, an Immense bower i
of pink ana white lilies and ferns graced
utes to convict him of the offense,
and this second defeat so chastened
the spirit of the man of millions that
he might never have been heard of
again in police circles had It not been
for that appeal.
Things move slowly In the Superior '
Court, however, and it was not till the
Ist of this month that a trio of the
Judges, sitting In bank, affirmed the
judgment of the Police Court. The
rfmittitur In the case was sent on
Monday to Judge Treadwell, successor
to Judge Low, and on a bench warrant
Issued under it Bradbury was taken
into court. The millionaire was in
formed that he would have to go to
jail. Through his attorney he aaked
that the court change the penalty to a
fine. Judge Treadwell could not see
It In that light.
"This Is not the place for such a
motion." he said. "The matter should
have been attended to In the Superior
Court. I have no power other than to
pass judgment, and I order that you
be imprisoned In the County Jail for
twenty-four hours, and God haye â
the large bay-window, and here the
young couple knelt while the solemn
binding words were spoken.
The wedding was set for noon, and
promptly at the appointed hour the
bridal procession was formed. First came
the ushers, E. M. Greenway, Peter D.
Martin, Frederick McNear and Andrew
Mizi.. r; following the ushers came the
maid of honor, Miss Hattie Belle joad.
who In turn preceded the bride, who was
escorted to the improvised altar by her
brother. Frank Goad. At the floral bower
Andrew Martin and his best man, Walter
-Martin, met the bride.
After the ceremony congratulations
were in order, and then the newly wedded
pair led the way to the dining hall,
where an elaborate bridal breakfast was
served.
The bride looked exquisitely beautiful
in her gown of white satin with yoke
and sleeves of rare old Honlton lace. The
tulle veil was fastened to the coiffure
with three diamond stars, the gift of the
groom, and the gown was fastened with
diamond and pearl pins, the gift of
Walter Martin.
Mis.s Hattie Belle Goad, the maid of
honor, wore a dainty gown of pink silk
shrouded in an overdress of pink illusion.
Her bouquet was of bridesmaids roses.
Mrs. Martin, mother of the groom, wore
a magnificent gray satin gown, trimmed
with flounces of. old Chantilly. The
corsage was ablaze with diamond orna
ments. Mrs. OsÃood Hooker, eldest
sister of the bride, wore an exquisite
Mark lace gown, and Mrs. C. K. Mc-
Intr.sh, the other sister of the bride, j
Linked extremely pretty in gray crepe,
with a garniture of pink roses. The j
bridal presents were exceptionally ,
beautiful. The brothers of the groom
were lavish In their gifts of jewels to the I
bride, and among other thingÂ« Walter !
Martin gave a beautiful string of pearls,
and Peter Martin a ring of pearls and un
cut BSpphire. Mrs. Martin's gift was a
magnificent chest of silver and a neck
and the sooner you get there the
sooner you'll get out."
The millionaire and his attorney did
not like the medicine. They asked
that they be given some time to ar
range matters, and In a spirit of ac
commodation Bradbury was taken to
the City Prison and confined in the
office, while his attorney wpnt to the
Supreme Court and applied for a writ
to review the case. He did not return
to his client until nearly 3 o'clock with
the information that the writ had been
denied. Bradbury had been a model
prisoner during the interim, as. not
withstanding the lack of amusement
in the City Prison and the multiplicity
of cracks in the flooring, he managed
so to control himself an to refrain
from squirting at any of them.
In charge of Sergeant of Police Wolf
and a Deputy Sheriff he was taken to
the jail on Broadway and placed in a
cell, in one corner of which was a
cuspidor with a hole in the top so
large that a man of Bradbury's ex
perionce could make a dead center In
the dark.

LORING CLUB OPENS
ITS WINTER SEASON
The Lot-insr Club inaugurated its third
season at Odd Fellows' Hall last evening
with a concert, the artistic quality of
â  which was upon the same level as all af-
I fairs given under the auspices of this
: organization. . A male chorus well oon
| ducted is always pleasant to hear, and
when it contains vocalists of the caliber
! which constitutes the Loring Club its per
formance must needs be witnessed with
delight. The gentlemen sing well to
gether and are able to obtain a splendid
volume, although now and then one would
like to hear still a little more force. The
bassos are especially good, while some
of the tenors are not quite as sure of
their high notes as they ought to be. Da
vid D. L,oring is an excellent leader, who
knows where the strength of his society
lies. But why does the club select con
stantly such antiquated musk 1 ? Why not
| render a modern selection now and then?
The composers are not all dead yet.
The Minetti quartet made its first ap
pearance on this occasion and proved it
self entitled to the distinguished position
of the leading string qunrtet on the Pa
cific Coast. Its ensemble work was par
ticularly excellent in the Dvorak quartet
in F major, where the individual virtuos
ity of the players oame in the foreground.
The Minetti quartet does clean ami accu
rate work, is attentive to the sentiment
embodied in the various compositions,
and its interpretation is delicate and con
tains character. It is just such a quartet
that is needed on this coast, as it con
tributes toward cleansing the musical at
mosphere. Inasmuch as this quartet will
give a series of concerts this winter there
will be ample opportunity to ventilate its
resources. Frank Coffin snng the solo
parts for the last time before his depart
ure to Europe, and it is quite interesting
to know that on this occasion he sang
the same solo which he rendered at his
first appearance with the Loring Club.
That he sang even better than during that
first occasion is a matter of course. And
now he ought to sing the same part after
his return from abroad.
The songs rendered were: "Rhine Wine
Song" (Liszt); "Aye Maria" (Abt); "After
the Battle" (Llebe); "The Haunted Mill"
(Strong); "Drinking Snng" (Mendelssohn).
The Minetti quartet played: Quartet, F
major, op. % A (Dvorak); largo from
quartet in E minor (B. Smetana); vivacis
simo from quartet No. 3, op. 7<> A (Baz
zini). ALFRED MKTZGER.
ORPHANS' DAY.
They Will Be the Guests at the Circus
To-Morrow.
There was neither a box nor fnur-bit
seat left in the bip tents at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets last night, and the Mains
put up a show that was value received
for every dollar that went Into the ticket
office. The menagerie, the horse fair and
the ringside were thronged until the ex
cellent minstrels, that wound up the per
formance, were finished. Although the
audiences that have greeted Main's show
since its arrival here have been large, that
of last night was unusual.
Every attraction of the big show will be
uncovered to-day and paraded through
the principal streets of the city lor five
hours. The procession will leave the lot
at Sixteenth and .Folsom streets at 9:30
p'Clock sharp.
To-morrow the management will keep
open house to the orphan asylums of the
city. The little folks will be taken
through everything on the grounds, and
it is not to cost any of them a cent; they
will be the guests of the circus people,
and a royal pood time is in store for them.
They will see the menagerie and Dockrill
and his rag-time horse and the sixty-three
big ponies and performing Shetlands all
doing their tricks together in one big ring,
and all the rest of the turns that are
brought on nightly. It is quite likely, too,
that they will be given a chance f> see
just how things are done behind the
scenes, although the management has not
been able yet to figure out how so many
youngsters as will be present can be taken
care of there without impeding the per
formance.
A philosopher says it is much easier
to make a blunder than it is to ac
knowledge it.
