Speculation as io the outcome of\
the crisis has now riven way in the \

newspapers to c discussion of mill- j
tary and strategical matters. The\
ultimatum was received in Sir Al-\

at I o clock Tuesday morning. Str]
Alfred had already notified Sir]
George White, so no time was lost-,
in taking the necessary steps.
As the British troops continue'
landing in South Africa and ad-.
vancir.g io the front ii is quite pos-\
sible, according to the terms of the
Boer, ultimatum, that hostilities have
already commenced, as Kruger, has
everything io gain by an instant ad-\
vance. Until the arrival of the]
army corps it is probable that thel
British will everywhere remain on
tlie defensive.
I
speculate at the present stage, but
sharp fighting is likely to occur at
Mafeking. where Colonel Baden-
Powell is pluckily holding his ex
posed position. As the generals have
decided not to attempt to hold the
country north of Dundee the Boers
will doubtless occupy Laings Nek
and advance alone the railway to

places, however, are considered
quite safe against Boer attack.

BRITONS THINK BOERS
HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
LONDON, Oct. 10.â The ultimatum of
the Transvaal Government ls naturally
the absorbing topic of conversation at
the clubs and in political circles to
night, and the late editions of the
afternoon papers, containing the text
of the ultimatum, met with a good
sale in the central parts of London,
the newsboys doing a thriving trade on
the closing of the theaters. There was
no apparent excitement, however, but a
general feeling was expressed that the
Boers had made a mistake, as their forc
ing .- ten would tend to alienate the
sympathy which might have beÂ»_ ex
tended to them had they thrown the
stigma of declaring war on Great Britain.
The text of the Boers' ultimatum on
arriving this morning was sent with all
speed to Lord Salisbury, who came to
lowa this evening, and a dispatch hex
was sent to the Prince of Wales, which
is only done In cases of special urgency.

comes from Lourenzo Marques. It states
that the British third-class cruiser
Philomel is anchored fifteen miles off the
port and is supposed to be waiting the
arrival of transports and warships to
pilot them into the harbor. It is quite
certain, however, that the transports
would not go to Lourenzo Marques unless
the British were about to fly their Mag
over port.
The Cabinet has been summoned to
meet at the Foreign Office on Friday next.
War preparations by Great Britain are
being pushed with the greatest energy.
The Woolwich arsenal has already for

Dr. Gavin Brown Clark, Radical mem

letter of thanks from Commandant Gen

declares that Cecil Rhodes. Dr. Jameson
and Mr. Chamberlain are responsible for
the mischief. He says:
"The Johannesburg clique say that Mr.
Chamberlain regards the existence of the
Orange Free State and the Transvaal as
two blots, which, as Cecil Rhodes has
said, must be wiped out from the map.
He seems desirous to do this with the
blood of the Afrikander people and of

of war is still scanty. Dispatches filed on

can city upon the nr-**.:hcfi .nent of th* war
with Spain. Bot this must cot be inter
preted to mean that England is not alive
to the realities of the situation. The au
dacity of the Transvaal's dispatch mo
mentarily stunned the public, and it was
only when under the glare of the music
hall lights and listening to the stirring
bars or the national anthem and other pa
triotic airs that the effect of the mo
mentary rebuff was lost in demonstrations
that shook the rafters. At the ; mbra
General Sir Redvers Bull er was preaent.
The first bars of "Rule Britannia" brought
the entire audience to its feet and for a
quarter of an hour the house resounded
with the choruses of national airs and
with cheers.
The Army and Navy Club, familiarly
known as the "Rag has not -.- many a
day seen such a gathering of campaigners
as wa-s there to-night. Nor was the
slowly aroused entnuslasm confined to
the officers. At Wellington Barracks,
where a battalion of Grenadiers which
forms a portion of the First Army Corps
had just returned from sixteen months'
service on the Rock of Gibraltar, the en
thusiasm knew no bounds. Seldom does
Tommy Atkins permit himself the luxury
of enthusiasm, but the regiment has had
a long spell of dreary garrison duty and
hailed the call to active service with
schoolboy delight.
Underneath all. however, officers, sub
alt-*rns and civilians recognize the fact
that the Transvaal campaign will not be
a picnic, and the sober reality of this
gives a stem- note to London life to
night than anything that has occurred
since the days of Gordon and Khar
toum.
The first Minister to speak publicly re
garding the ultimatum was Lord James
of Hereford, Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, who, speaking at Aberdeen to
night said:
"The Government has done everything
in its power to preserve peace. Appar
ently, however, diplomacy is ended and
the hopes of peace are virtually destroyed,
and that not by the action of the Queen's
Government, but by the Transvaal Gov
ernment. President Kruger has sent an
ultimatum. If we were to withdraw our
troops at his bidding we should suffer the
greatest humiliation, an.i the Govern
ment would deserve to be hunted from
office as craven cowards."
Lord James said he had Intended, before
receiving the news of the ultimatum, to
take a different view of the position, but
row nothing remains but to commend our
cause to the God of battle and arms and
to Implore his blessing upon the engage
ment about to be entered upon.
Lord James, whose remarks were greet
ed with loud and prolonged cheers, con
cluded by expressing hope that the. war
would be short and humanely conducted,
and when It was terminated counsels of
moderation would prevail as to the way
In which the enemy should be dealt with.

DEFIANT TONE OF
THE BRITISH PRESS
LONDON, Oct. li.â The Standard says:
"The Transvaal's worst enemies could

would lead it to such in extravagance.
The note is written in a style which would
i be offensive- If it came from a first rate
power, and is inconceivably ridiculous as
emanating from a trumpery little State

The Daily Mail says: "The Boers have
doffed the mask and declared war, which
their deluded supporters in England had
considered so impossible. Doubtless at
first we may suffer, but we suffered be
fore, and In the end the Boers and their
supporters will receive the punishment
which their insane attempt to perpetuate
yon an almost barbaric system their gov

thoroughly deserves."

ULTIMATUM PRESENTED TO
GREAT BRITAIN.
CAPE TOWN". Oct. It.â The Transvaal Government ha? sent an ultimatum to
Great Britain.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â The diplomatic circumstances surrounding, the pre
sentation of the Transvaal republic's ultimatum are probably without pre
cedent. Ordinarily a foreign power when addressing peremptory demands
to another sends them through an embassador or minister accredited to
Its adversary. The Transvaal Government, however, has no diplomatic repre
sentative recognized by Great Britain. Montague White, the Transvaal Consul
General In London, would not be received by either the Foreign Office or the
Colonial Office. Consequently, President Kruger was reduced to handing the
ultimatum to Conyngham Greene at Pretoria, who In turn wired it to Sir Alfred
Milner, British High Commissioner in South Africa, by whom it was retrans
mitted to Mr. Chamberlain, who thus becomes' the first Secretary- of State for the
Colonies to receive an ultimatum. As soon as the communication was trans
lated from the cipher in which it was transmitted, Mr. Chamberlain forwarded it
to the Foreign Office. The ultimatum is as follows:
"Sir: The Government of the South African republic feels itself compelled
to refer the Government of her Majesty, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,
once more to the convention of London of IS-S4, concluded between this re
public and the United Kingdom, and which in article XIV secures certain speci
fled rights to the white population of this republic, namely, that all other per
sons than natives on conforming themselves to the laws of the South African
Republic:
1. Will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel or reside in any
part of the South African Republic.
2. They will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses,
shops and other premises.
3. They can carry on their commerce either in person or by any agrents
whom they may think fit to employ.
4. They shall not be subject, In respect of their premises or property or
in respect of their commerce and industry, to any taxes other than those which
are or may be imposed upon the citizens of said republic.
"This Government wishes further to observe that the only rights which her Ma
jesty's Government has reserved in the above convention are with regard to
the Outlander population of this republic, and that a violation only of those
rights could give that Government a right to diplomatic representations or in
tervention; while, moreover, the regulation of all other questions affecting the
position of the rights of the Outlander population under the above mentioned
convention is band over to the Government and representatives of the peo
ple of the South African Republic.
"Among the questions the regulation of which falls exclusively within the
competence of this Government and of the ". --.ad are included those of
the franchise and the representation of the people in this republic, and although
this exclusive right of this Government and of the Volksraad for the regula
tion' of the franchise and the representation of the people is indisputable, yet
this Government has found occasion to discuss, in friendly fashion, the fran
chise and representation of the people with her Majesty's Government, with
out, however, recognizing any right thereto on the part of her Majesty's Gov
ernment.
"This Government has also by the formulation of now existing franchise
law and by reason, with regard to the representations, constantly held these
friendly ... before its eyes. On the part of her Majesty's Government,
however, the friendly nature of these discussions have assumed more and more
a threatening tone, and the minds of the people of this republic and the whole
of South Africa have been excited and a condition of extreme ten-don has been
created owing to the fact that her Majesty's Government could no longer agree
to the question respecting the franchise and the resolution respecting the repre
sentation in this respect; and finally by your note of September 25, 1599. which
broke off all friendly correspondence on the subject and intimated that her Ma
jesty's Government must now proceed to formulate their own proposals for the
final settlement. r . - v
"This Government can only see in the above Intimation from her Majesty's
Government a new violation of the convention of London, in ISS4, which does not
reserve to her Majesty's Government the right to a unilateral settlement of a
question which is exclusively a domes' one for this Government and which has
already been regulated by this Government.
"On account of the strained situation and the consequent serious loss in and
Interruption of the trade in general, which the correspondence respecting fran
chise and the representation of the people of the republic has carried in its
train, her Majesty's Government had recently pressed for an early settlement and
final -pressed, ty your intervention, for an answer within forty- i hours, a
demand subsequently somewhat modified, to your note of September 12, replied
to by the note of this Government of September 15. and to your note of Sep
tember 273. ISS3, and thereafter further friend!:- negotiations were broken off, this
Government receiving an intimation that a proposal for final settlement would
shortly be made.
"Although this premise was once more reported, the proposal up to mho has
not reached this eminent. Even while this friendly correspondence was Suit
going on the Increase of troops on a large scale was introduced by her Majesty's
Government, the troops being stationed in the neighborhood of the borders of me
republic
"Having referred to recurrences In the history of this republic, which It Is un
necessary here to call to mind, this republic felt obliged to regard this military
force In the neighborhood of its borders as a threat against the independence
of the South African republic, hence it was aware of no circumstances which
would justify the presence of such a military force in South Africa, and :..e
neighborhood of its borders.
"In answer to an inquiry with respect thereto, an address to his Excellency,
the High Commissioner, this Government received -to its great astonishment in
answer a veiled Insinuation that, from the side of the republic, an attack was
being made on her Majesty's Colonies, and at the same time a mysterious ref
erence to possibilities, whereby this Government was strengthened in Its sus
picion that the independence of this republic was being threatened. As a de
fensive measure this Government was, therefore, obliged to send a portion of the
burghers of this republic in order to offer requisite resistance to impossibilities.
"Her Majesty's unlawful intervention In the internal affairs of this republic,
in conflict with the London convention of ISS-t. by the extraordinary strength
ening of her troops In the neighborhood of the borders of this republic has
caused an intolerable condition of things to arise, which this Government feels
itself obliged, in the interest not only of this republic but also of all South
Africa, to make an end of as soon as possible, and this Government feels itself
called upon and obliged to press earnestly and with emphasis for an immediate
termination of this state of things and to request her Majesty's Government to
give assurances upon the following four demands:
Firstâ That all points of mutual differences be
regulated by friendly recourse to arbitration or by
whatever amicable way that may be agreed upon by
this Government and Her Majesty's Government.
Secondâ That all troops on the borders of this
repub'.ic shall be instantly withdrawn.
Thirdâ That all reinforcements of troops, which
have arrived in South Africa since June 1, 1899, shall
be removed from South Africa within a reasonable
time, to be agreed upon with this Government, and
with the mutual assurance and guarantee on the
part of this Government that no attack upon or hos
tilities against any portion of the possessions of the
British Government shall be made by this republic
during the further negotiations, within a period of
time to be subsequently agreed upon between the
governments: and this Government will, on compli
ance therewith, be prepared to withdraw the armed
burghers of this republic from the borders.
Fourthâ That Her Majesty's troops which are
now on the high seas shall not be landed in any part
of South Africa.
This Government presses for an immediate and
affirmative answer to these four questions, and
earnestly requests Her Majesty's Government to re
turn an answer before or upon Wednesday, October
11, 1899, not later than 5 o'clock p. m
It desires further to add that in the unexpected
event of an answer unsatisfactory being received by
it within the interval, it will greatly regret to be
compelled to regard the action of Her Majesty's Gov
ernment as a formal declaration of war. and will not
hold itself responsible for the consequences thereof,
and that in the event of any further movement of
troops occurring within the above-mentioned time in
a nearer direction to our border, this Government
will be compelled to regard that also as a formal
declaration of war.

will be received with profound regret by
1a majority of the British people. To the

TRANSVAAL BACKED
BY THE FREE STATE
LONDON, Oct. 10.â A dispatch from
Pretoria, dated .Monday evening, says:
"Owing to' the st a of the country
generally and tho sad circumstances
which prevail. It has been officially an
nounced that there will be no birthday
reception at the Presidency. Matters are
becoming critical, and many of the
burghers and the three main commandoes
are impatient and feel that it is suicidal
to await the arrival of overwhelming re
inforcements from England. The Presi
dent has done his utmost to stem this
feeling in the hone that diplomacy might
still settle matters. During the past few
days telegraphic conferences have been
held with President Steyn. and whatever
course shall be taken by the Transvaal
will receive the commendation and sup
port of the Free State.
"It is freely rumored in the town, and
is believed to be correct, that the Gov
ernment assumed its firm position be
cause Great Britain's new proposals have
not arrived, though Conyngham Greene,
the British diplomatic agent at Pre
toria, informed State Secretary Reitz
nine days ago that they would be for
mulated in a few days' time. Conse
quently the burghers are alarmed at the
continued dispatch of troops from Eng
land and India.
"A telegram received here outlines the
ultimatum In terms already cabled,
which the correspondent gathers has lust
been dispatched."
The correspondent adds: "Martial law
may be proclaimed on Wednesday, but all
depends upon Great Britain's reply. The
Transvaal forces arc being augmented by
volunteers of all nationalities. The War
Office is very busy. Ambulance parties
are starting for the front. There is still
the faintest hope that war may be
averted."
BRITONS DISPLAY
THEIR WARLIKE FEELING
LONDON, Oct. 10.â The more peaceful
nor of the morning's news and com
ments had scarcely been digested and
aroused hope that President Kruger's
birthday would also mark the dissipation
or the commencement of the dissipation
of the clouds hanging over South Africa
when the sensational announcement that
the Transvaal Government had handed a
definite ultimatum to the British diplo
matic agent In Pretoria caused a rapid
slump In the hopes of those who believe
that diplomacy will yet save the situation.
It is understood from the movements of
Ministers and the activity of the Govern
ment offices that developments are immi
nent, although whether they are pacific
or warlike remains an enigma.
The officials at the Colonial Office worked
all night, and Mr. Chamberlain arrived
there early this morning. In some quar^
ters It is intimated that the Government
has received notification of the Boer ul
timatum and is relieved In consequence,
as the Government considers the Boers
now placed in a position of having forced
on war.
Whatever the official feeling may be,
there Is no mistaking the significance ol
the great manifestation, combined with
the war spirit, which occurred In the
streets of London this morning when the
New South Wales Lancers traversed the
city to embark for South Africa. Tens of
thousands assembled to do homage to the
little handful ."of soldiers representing the
empire's ally.
From the arrival of the squadron at
Waterloo station to the embarking on the
railway train at Fenchurch station tu
multuous scenes of wild enthusiasm
marked the route traversed. The" bands
were allowed to play nothing but "Soldiers
of the Queen," "Rule Britannia" and
"God Save the Queen," in which the dense'
crowds joined.
It is doubtful If such frenzied welcome
v. .is ever before witnessed In London.
There was an Incessant roar of cheers and I
song until the Mansion House, the official i
residence of the Lord Mayor of London,
was reached. Here traffic was completely
blocked by th" surging throngs, and it
was only with the greatest difficulty that
the Lord Mayor, Sir John Voce Moore, in
the full robes of office, restrained the sing
ing and vociferous cheering when he ad
dressed the troops, wishing them godspeed
and expressing the interest of the country
in their heroic determination to assist in
asserting Imperial authority in South Af
rica. Sir John .'aid: â¢ "â¢'<
"I hope there will not he war, but the
necessities of the moment require a dem
onstration of authority."
The inspiring scene closed with the sing
ing of the national anthem, the Lord
Mayor leading.
A similar occurrence took place at Fen
church station. The windows In the
neighborhood were crowded with sight
seers, who showered miniature union
jacks and squares of bunting hearing the
portrait of the Queen upon the passing
troops. When the station was reached an.
incident occurred, typical of the readiness,
of the colonists to fight. .. ;-
Viscount Hampden, former Governor
and commander-in-chief of New South
Wales, was present. A sergeant major
stepped forward and drew Lord Hamp
den's attention to the fact that he was

ship- when the latter belonged to the New
South Wales Lancers. Lord Hampden

the sergeant major cautioned him, say
ing: "That sword has been sharpened and !
Is ready for active service." Â .
The reports from all the military en
ters show that the mobilization orders
are received with great enthusiasm now j
that President Kruger has crossed the i
Rubicon and taken the irrevocable step. j
of issuing an ultimatum. The wonder is '
Why, if President Kruger is resolved upon j
fighting, he has waited so long. The ex- !
planation seems to be that his hand has
been forced by the fact that- the Boers I
have got out of control or that if he
awaited the arrival of the British army
ewrps the chances of military success for
him would be of the slimmest possible
character.
The expiration of the time limit of the
ultimatum to-morrow evening does not
leave Great Britain much time to
strengthen the present military position,
although there are still a few troops
at Durban, Natal, available for dispatch
to the front, but the Government will
doubtless now adopt the suggestion to
form the refugees from the Rami into
volunteer regiments.
Outside the momentous news of the ul
timatum nothing of moment has been re
ceived tills morning from the scene of ac
tion except the announcement that the
Boers have constructed forts commanding
La ings Neck, and that guns have been
mounted on Mount Pogwane and Mount
Prospect.

LONDON, Oct. 10. âAlgernon Swin

entitled "October Ninth, Eighteen Ninety-

Patience, long sick to death, is dead. Too
long
Have sloth and doubt and treason bidden
us be
What Cromwell's England was not when
the sea
To him bore witness, given of Blake, how
strong
She stoodâ a commonweal that brooked
no wrong
From foes less vile than men, like wolves
. set free,
Whose war Is waved, where none may
fight or flee,
With women and with weanlings. Speech
and song
Lack utterance now for loathing since we
hear
Foul tongues that blacken God's dishon-
o red name, ' /,â¢>'. r .
With prayed turned curses and with
praise found shame.
Deny the truth whose witness now draws
near.
To scourge these dogs, agape with Jaws
afoam,
Down out of life. Strike, England, and
strike home!

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11. 1899.
SALOON MEN LOSE
PASADENA FIGHT
Sanitary District Will Be
Established.
â â -â¢
THE CONTEST A BITTER ONE
. â , m
MATTER WILL BE CARRIED INTO
THE COURTS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Oct. 10.â North Pasadena
and Lamanda Park declared by vote to
day in favor of sanitary districts, under
the State Legislative act. The Lamanda
Park vote was 126 for and 101 against;
North Pasadena, 195 for and 109 against.
The elections were quiet, and nearly as
heavy a vote was polled as at the general
election. The saloon men say they will
fight the law in court by the advice of
their lawyers.
"We propose to spot Southern California
all- over with sanitary districts, and they
will all be white spots, too. We will abol
ish all saloons and roadhouses in at least
fifteen counties of this State. Los An
geles County is not one of these. We can
raver root the evil out of that city. I am
afraid." So spoke State Superintendent
Dr. E. S. Chapman of the Anti-Saloon
League during the campaign for the es
tablishment of the districts at Lamanda
Park and North Pasadena.
The fight was started on April 10, when
a call was Issued by Dr. 11. A. Keid of
this city, who is State secretary of the
Anti-Saloon League. The call invited the
pastors of all the churches to send dele
gates to the annual convention of the
league at the Young Men's Christian As
sociation building, Los Angeles, on May ;
4. The call set forth that "it will be our !
aim and prayerful endeavor during the en- j
suing year to enlist and unify all the j
Christian forces of Southern California In ;
such steady, persistent and practical of- j
forts as may be suited to the conditions |
existing In each locality for pushing the ;
battle of the churches against the saloon- |
licensing sin and shame of our land."
Nearly every church responded with a
delegate, and Rev. Dr. Chapman was j
c-hosen State superintendent of the league, !
It was agreed with Dr. H. A. Reid, the,
originator of the successful fight against
Pasadena city saloons, that the sanitary
district State law of 1895, providing tor
organization of local self-governments,
was sufficient to knock out the roadhouses
which exist just outside the city limits.
The law gives the local rulers, called the i
sanitary board, five in number, just as
complete control over saloons and all oth
er matters requiring police attention as is
enjoyed by the City Council of Pasadena.
The expense of Inaugurating and main
taining such a local government, which
could refuse to grant liquor licenses, is
smallâ not one-fourth as much as it is for
a city of the sixth class.
The sanitary district law was sustained
in the Supreme Court in a tost case taken
up from Alameda County, but the saloon
keepers say that they will fight it in court
nevertheless. They say that the portion
cf It pertaining to liquor licenses has not
yet been fully tested:
A petition signed by residents of La
manda Park and another signed by resi
dents of North Pasadena, both places be
ing just outside the city limits, was pre
sented to the county Board of Supervisors,
asking that an election be called. Elec
tions were called for October 10.
The candidates for the Sanitary Board
In North Pasadena were C. W. Rhodes,
Byron Lisk. Calvin Thornton. F. G. Good
speed and Royal Plummer. Those at La
mande Park were A. L. Bchofield. C. A.
Day, A. A. WejTnuth and W. T. Sibley.
The fight has been a hot one. The anti
saloon people have held mass meetings
weekly and semi-weekly, and have Issued
hundreds of handbills, dodgers and
badges. There have been distinguished
speakers here. The saloon men. while j
tending to care little whether the elec
tion earned or not, have hired several
lawyers, and "twelve reasons why the dis
trict would : not be advantageous to the
people. have been issued and widely circu
lated. The Liquor Dealers' Association
of Los Angeles put up the money arid se
cured the services of F. F. Davis, attor
iney. Attorney W. S. Wright represented
j the Los Angeles Brewing Company, Judge <
' H. H. Rose the Lamanda Park saloon

CONVENTION OF CATHOLICS.
Union of Societies May Be Effected in
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10.â In tho move
ment to form a federation of interests
among the many Catholic societies of Los
Angeles, the Young Men's Institute has
taken the initiative through Montgomery
Council. Every organization has been in
vited to send delegates to a > convention
that will be held October 26 comprising
the Catholic societies In Los Angelesâ the
Young Men's Institute, one branch of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians.: two Socie
ties of the Catholic Knights of America,
one of the Catholic Order of Foresters
and the Los Angeles Catholic Beneficial
Association. Every one of these ls ex
pected to send delegates based upon the
proportion of one delegate for each
twenty-five members. Bishop Montgom
ery has been invited to address the con
vention, and other prominent Catholic
clergymen as well as laymen will attend
the meeting. Anthony Schwamm, Deputy
Supreme President, speaking of the plans,
says:
"This proposed federation has been agi
tated for some time and has no political
or any other significance. However,
Catholic interests have been anything
but united and therefore the first result
of this convention will be harmony among
all Catholic societies. The attention of
the delegates will be called to the action
of several leading magazines In publish
i ing a certain advertisement which reflects
i seriously upon Catholics. No doubt pro
[ tests will be made against reviving the
i anti-Catholic spirit which this advertise
! ment suggests. Other matters of im
portance alone to the different societies
will he discussed and steps will be taken
to make this proposed federation perma-
I nent and effective."

ADMIRAL DEWEY IS
IN HIS NATIVE STATE
Bonfires Blaze on the Mountain Peaks
and the People Welcome the Re
turning Hero.
SHELBURNE. Vt., Oct. Admiral Dewey is home at last and Is happy to be
within the shadow of the Green Mountains and beside the water of Lake
Champlain, away from the noise and bustle that have filled his ears since his
flagship, the Oiympia, came In sight of Sandy Hook. The fact that the ad
miral was really in Vermont was signaled to-night on all mountain peaks by
bonfires and electric searchlights from one end of the State to the other. Admiral
Dewey is the guest of Dr. Seward Webb at his country residence, Shelburne farm,
and will not become the State's guest until Thursday at the capital, Montpellier.
He came here on a special train from New York City this morning, occupying Dr.
Webb's magnificent car, the Elsmere.
In the party were the admiral and his ' son, Dr. Webb, Flag Lieutenant
Brumby, Governor Smith of Vermont and several railway officials. While In New-
York State Admiral Dewey remained within the car chatting with the others of
the party. But after crossing the Vermont line, above White Hall, the admiral
seemed to grow a little nervous, spoke of his home-coming repeatedly and went
out on the rear platform, although the car was an observatory' car, to view the
scenery. He seemed to be very happy and to those who were around him it ap
peared almost as If the admiral had had a touch of homesickness. As the train
ncared Shelburne the admiral watched the changing scenery intently. Here and
there a flag was seen", but it is nature that has done the lavish painting on this
great occasion, for the Vermont woods are one mass of autumn color. When the
train pulled into Shelburne the villagers and folks from the surrounding towns,
even as far away as Burlington, had made up a crowd of nearly 3000. The en
gine stopped just at the station, so that the rear car, the Elsmere, was abreast
of a little grass plat down the track. When the train stopped Admiral Dewey
stood upon the rear platform. Preceded by Dr. Webb, he walked across the
lawn, where an open landau, drawn by two black horses, was in waiting. As the
admiral walked across the lawn a band from Burlington played "Under the
Double Eagle," a selection made at the special request of the admiral.
As Admiral Dewey stepped into the carriage a salute of seventeen guns was
fired from behind a mass of shrubbery near by. Admiral Dewey remained erect
In the carriage with . hat and gloves In hand, bowing and smiling to the people
around him. He was dressed in a gray cutaway suit and wore a silk hat.
Dr. Webb handed in the admiral's son, who took a seat. Then the crowd of
eager people closed around the carriage until the admiral looked into a sea
of faces. Just at the steps of the carriage stood a man In working clothes,
Michael McKenzie of this city, noticeable because of his height. Suddenly
McKenzie threw his cap Into the air and yelled: "Let's give three cheers for
Admiral Dewey, the hero 'of Manila." The cheers were given.
The admiral stared, looked wonderingly at the man, dropped his hat and
gloves and then impulsively shook McKenzie's hand, which' was still in the air
after tossing his hat. Instantly the hands of the crowd were outstretched toward
the carriage, but Admiral 'Dewey started back in fear, drew his hand toward
his body and said: "No, no, I can't do that; my hands are very sore; too sore
for that." Bowing again and speaking almost inaudibly an expression of thanks
he sat down. The crowd drew back a little, Lieutenant Brumby and Dr. Webb
took their seats and the carriage passed out of the station grounds.
Along the road were drawn up 200 school children, each with a flag and head
ed by their, teacher. At a signal the children sang a parody on "Yankee Doodle
Dandy," beginning: "Yankee Dewey went to sea." The movement of the car
riage was so timed that it reached the end of the line just as the chorus was
reached and the. admiral, who had stood up in passing, bowed his acknowledg
ments.' The horses were then whipped up and the admiral was driven to Shel
burne House at Shelburne farm, three miles away. In the carriages which fol
lowed were other members of the party with the admiral's Chinese valet on
the box with the driver of the second carriage.
WHEELER SPEAKS
TO STANFORD MEN
Education and Athletics
Go Together.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 10.â
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of ; California addressed the
students of Stanford in the university
chapel this afternoon at 3 o'clock.
Dr. Jordan in introducing the speaker
paid a high tribute to President Wheeler,
saying that his coming to California was
one of the most fortunate things that ever
happened to the State.
President Wheeler spoke as follows:
"I feel at home at Stanford already. It j
reminds me of Cornell,, where I spent
thirteen years of my life, when I see the
spirit you have here and a Cornell man
as your president. At Cornell there is
a fraternity spirit of academic discipline
permeating the whole college, life, and I
understand you have it here. I miss the
rowing crews to which I became used at
Cornell. I cannot conceive of a university
without a crew. Now, I beg of you,
students of Stanford, go down to the bay
and row. Do It for the benefit of the
University of California and add this to
your many benefices toward her. Row
ing is better than football. It teaches
eight men to co-operate perfectly. It
does men good to get out on the water.
Get a boat and row and make it hard for
the boys of Berkeley to beat you.
"I love to lie here with you students
to-day. One reason I hesitated to accept
my present position was because I feared
it would shut me up in an office a-.\ay
from the students. I want you Stanford
students to feel that I am interested in
you and you may be assured that 1 shall
be interested in you even during the next
football game. : '
"Just as much as I believe In the dif
ferentiation in athletics and studies, I
believe In the differentiation among col
leges. When men from the small col
leges come to me for graduate work* l
find that they are quite as well prepared
as those from the larger universities to
carry on any advanced work. So I dis
like to hear any one disparage the small
or denominational colleges. Many men
would not be interested in colleges at all
If it had not been for their relation
through the churches.
"I want you to feel proud of your State
University. And I also want Stanford
men to go before the people of the State
and get them to give to the State Uni
versity. You work with your instruments
and we work with ours, but our common
end and aim is the same. Everything we
have is In common, even our only enemy
â barbarity Is common property.
"I have taught classes day after day
In Brown. Harvard and Cornell, yet I
have never been disappointed when my
boys turn up and tell me that they have
forgotten everything about Greek. The
real education is rubbing up against men
and learning the problems of life, and not
memorizing a few subjects. The bureau
drawer idea is not my Idea of a univer
sity. It Is not a place to isolate young
men from life In order that they may
wait, nor to postpone the problems of life.
"You don't hoar much to-day about uni
versity men not being prepared for busi
ness, for they are going Into all the offices
of Wall street, the railroad offices and
editorial rooms of our largest journals.
"If a man has appreciated the opportu
nities of his university training he goes
out with accumulated power to shake
things. You must learn to study so that
you can continuously think about things,
while at the bottom there must be en
thusiastic for your work. You are engaged
In the same work and headed toward the
same goal that we are over at Berkeley,
and I wish for you only the best and bid
you godspeed.â¢^

AN INDUSTRIAL PARADE
Fireworks Explode, Causing a Panic on
the Street and Serious Injure to
Several Persons,
CHICAGO. Och 10.â The last pageant of
the fall festival was the industrial parade
to-night. A drizzling rain was falling.
and only a very small crowd turned out
to witness it. The parade' was confined to
floats of business houses.
A display cf tire not on the parade pro
gramme took place when the procession
was passing along State street. A float
representing a man reclining on a mount
ain of collars and cuffs caught tire, and
the frightened horses tried to rush upon
the sidewalk, which was lined with spec
tators. At this moment another float col
lided with the one on Are, and before long
both were blazing fiercely. By this time
the people on the street were in a panic.
The police were busy with the burning
Scats and could not stop the crushing
and roughness in the crowd. Children j
were stepped on, and women reeled back
Into the crowd exhausted. A bunch of
fireworks on one of the floats exploded. ;
Through the smoke the poiice saw two :
women and three men on one float im
prisoned in the burning stuff. '1 hey fought

PRESIDENTS ESCAPE.
CHICAGO. Oct. lO.â At 11:30 to-night j
President McKinley ar.d members of his j
Cabinet left Chicago for Evansville, Ind., '
on a special train. His departure, with
the cheers ot ar immense throng ringing j
in his ears, brought, to a close a day of i
genuinely hard work. ir. which the Presi- j
dent had sciircely i moment of leisure for j
himself. The crowds which greeted him ]
at every turn were so good-natured and i
so disposed to cheer that the President, j
although wearied, expressed himself aa i
having enjoyed himself.
Ar. exciting incident, varied and for a !
moment threatened to upset the Presi- 1
dent's ceaseless round of activity. While i
In his carriage on Congress street, en j
route to Mem. rial Kail, to greet the mem- i
bers of the Society of the Army of Ten- I
tressee, one of the horses attached to the '
President.! carriage became fractious ar.d I
evinced a desire to run. The driver had i
.... he could do to restrain the animal, and j
after be had been tugging at the lines !
for several blocks, the horse rinaiiy broke;
away and started on a run. Captain Matt '
Piniierton of the Chicago Hussars, a de- I
tachment oi which haa joined the pro- i
cession, galloped beside the unmanageacle
horse ana grasped its bridle, bringing the
animal to a slow trot. The captain main
tained his ,ht;id for the balance of the
trip.
President McKlnley had scarcely fin- j
ished breakfast this morning when a dc.c- ;
gatioa of /laboring men reached the Audi- j
tcrium. The President was ciosited with i
them for half an hour. â  j
The party was mad. up principally of j
members of the Bricklayers' and Stone- j
masons' Union, which made the President ;
an honorary member of their organiza
tion.
President Gubbins of the union in con
versation mentioned the "bricklayers' or
ganization.""
TOur organization, if you please; don't
forget r__-\" smiled Mr. McKinley. and the
committee promised that he would always i
be remembered as a full-fledged union â¢
bricklayer and stonemason.
fhe President asked many questions !
relative to the condition cf Chicago's
laboring people and expressed his pleas- j
ure that they were feeling the erfects of
prosperity.
The cornerstone trouble which arose
from the employment of non-union labor i
in cutting the first stones, and which for
a time threatened the ceremony of yes- j
terday was not spoken of.
The President declared that he consid- !
ered it a compliment to belong to the i
Bricklayers' Union, and pulled from an !
inside pocket the card entitling him to i
a voice in its proceedings.
"I would like to have the international !
body of which our body is a part hold its 1
convention of 1901 in Washington-" said '
the President as the building tradesmen |
were about to retire.
President Gubbins thanked him for the !
invitation and declared that the matter â¢
would be laid before the delegates to the I
convention of 1DÂ»X). i
When the President emerged from th* j
hotel the weather could not have been
nearer perfection. Mr. McKinley drove
first to the Battle of Manila, a panoramic J
reproduction of the famous battle, where I
he spent a few minutes.
In the G. A. P.. Memorial Hall he next '
greeted, the Army of the Tennessee, which !
is holding its reunion at that place. In
addition to the fifty veterans present the
hall was packet! with spectators, who
cheered frantically.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER It, 1899.
YACHTS REMAIN AT
THEIR MOORING BUOYS
NEW YOF-K. Oct. 10.â Hard luck con
tinues to pursue the big single-stickers.
; On the three days last week when the
', yachts made attempts to sail. light, fluky
j winds left them stranded on the course
'- when the time limit expired. To-day a
â  fogbank prevented them from even lea<.-
lng their mooring buoys inside the spit
of land which forms the Sandy Hook ar
the entrance of the lower bay. This was
by far the most dismal fiasco of all. City
; and bay were done up in gray swathing
: clothes of impenetrable mists when the
I yachtsmen jumped out of bed this morn
'â  ing to get a look at the weather, and
there was gloom and dismay along the
water front. The old salts sniffed, saw
: the mist wreaths arid shook their heads.
"Nothing doing on the ocean to-day,"
[ was their verdicr.
But the Weather Bureau, with its sci
[ entitle meteorological methods, and pre
! dieted fair weather with freshening winds
i for to-day, and a few clung vainly to the
: hope that the Weather Bureau prognos
', tications would turn out true for once.
lOf course, the poor, misguided public
1 went like lambs to the slaughter. They
j backed Uncle Sam's weather oracle and
j put to sea. But not in such number as
j last week. Many of the sightseers who
; witnessed the three tiukes at an average
i cost per Cuke of from SS to $25 had lost
: their interest, and lt will take a rest to
j restore it.
Meantime the racers lay tied to their
i big buoy 3 inside the Horseshoe, rhe fog
; had let down its gray curtains all around
â  them. The circle of vision was barely 2*W
: yards in diameter. The yachts were as
\ complereiv shut eff from rhe rest of the
i worid as "if they had been inside a big
'< circus tent- The gray water matched
: the gray mist and blotted out the sky
; and sea line. The sun tried to bore Into
the gloom and once or twice Its dim out
i lines, looking like a shining silver dollar,
< could Just be discerned through the haze.
! There was no wind to lift the cloud of
! mist that literally rested on the water.
â¢ If anything, the curtain seemed to grow
: denser as the tin for the yachts to get
I under way approached. It was mani
i festiy impossible for the yachts to put to
â¢ sea in such weather. Sir Thomas Lipton
' and Mr. Iselin had agreed at 9 o'clock
s not to sail until the fog lifted ami there
; was a suitable breeze. So the big sloops
i lay idly at their moorings. Their crews
: loafed about the decks with nothing tc
:do but wait- The prospect of a race was
never at any time good enough to even
' justify them in removing the covers from
i their mainsails. About them lay the little
; flotilla of bottle-holders who attend upon
i the lighters of the deep â tenders, barge-.
'. and launches.
Sir Thomas and his guests aboard the
; Erin and the flagship of the New Tork
Yacht Club, the Corsair, with Commodore
Morgan and his guests, were within hail
-1 ing distance of the yachts. Through the
mists came the muffled clang of the great
! fog bell at the Hook, tolling Its warning
! to mariners, while from the distance float
: ed in the deep wail of the fog horns of the
', excursion steamers as they felt their way
' out toward the starting- line. Shortly be
fore 12 o'clock the committee boat, which
RENEWED ACTIVITY IN
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
General Advances Along the Ameri
can Lines Begun and Heavy
Fighting Is Expected.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING- '
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.â
A general advance along the American
lines in Luzon has begun and War De
partment officials expect reports of some j
heavy fighting within the next few days.
Official dispatches received to-day and
not made public show that both Generals
Lawton and HacArthur are moving
northward with their forces, the purpose
being to get control of the railroad ajid
important towns as far north as possi
ble. Eventually it Is intended to send an
expedition by water to Lingayen. near the
northern terminus of the railway, so as
to flank the enemy. This expedition,
however, will not start until additiontl
troops have arrived. Meanwhile divisions
under both Lawton and Mac Arthur will
push to the north as far as they can.
According to j statements made at the
War Department to-day this advance is
to be made permanent. There are to be
no more towns taken and then aban
doned. "With the additional troops which
have arrived during the rainy season and
others to follow General Corbln says that
there will be a sufficient number of troops
available to garrison the towns as fast
as they are taken and still leave a for
midable force for continuing the onward
movement. It is this northward move
ment of American forces that probably
accounts for the recent great activity of
the insurgents south of Manila. This aiso
probably accounts for General Schwan's
appearance In the field at the head of a
column. He had been assigned to duty as
chief of staff and War Department au
thorities were congratulating themselves
that General Otis would leave to him the
details cf administrative work and thu3
be free to take up important work whlcn
properly belongs to a commander in chief.
"Without knowing definitely what
brought about this sudden change in Gen
eral Schwan's duties, the authorities be-
I lieve that the withdrawal of General
! Young from the south to join Generals
! Mac Arthur and Lawton tn the movement
[ northward resulted in renewed activity
: among the Insurgents south of Manila,
j and caused General Otis to assign Gen
i eral Schwan to a command for the pur
-1 pose of reinforcing General Grant-
In Otis' dispatch to the War Depart
i ment yesterday the only mention made of
' the marines was that they and the war
vessels at Cavite "made demonstrations
at Noveleta yesterday. General Schwan
advancing at the same time."
Naval officers assert that from Otis' dis
patch it would be judged that the credit
for the capture of Noveleta was due to
the army, and they are comparing the af
fair with the capture of lloilo. which was

TO ADVANCE INTEREST
ON GOVERNMENT BONDS
Plan cf Secretary Vanderlip to Put
More Money Into General
Circulation-
WASHINGTON. Oct. 10.â Assistant
Secretary Vanderlip has decided to antici
pate the interest for the entire fiscal year,
the period ending with July 1, 11W0. The
interest due November 1 will be paid in
full without discount, but if holders of
bonds wish to take advantage of the offer
to anticipate interest due on subsequent
dates a discount at the rate of two-tenths
of one per cent will be exacted.
The amount of interest due from now to
the end of the fiscal year is about $.10,
--000,000; The prepayment of this amount
will, it is believed, be a relief of much
Importance to the present stringent
money situation, while on the other hand
the discount will be a saving of a large
amount to the Government. The Treas
urer is in a position to advance these In
terest payments' without the .east em
barrassment.
The interest November 1 is made
up of the 3 per cent loan of IS9S and the
as of 1904 ar.d the 4s of 1925 L There is
Jl.6oo.SfiO coupon interest which will be

WIFE MURDERED
IN A HOWARD
STREET SALOON
Charles Richardson
the Slayer.
m
PERHAPS IN SELF-DEFENSE
DEAD WOMAN WIELDED HEAVY
BUNG-STARTER.
4
Neighbors and Witnesses Say tho
Pair Were Constantly Quarrel
ing and the Killing Was
the Result.
Charles Richardson, keeper of a low
saloon at 948 Howard street, ended a long
series of family quarrels last night by
killing his wife, Ellen . Richardson. The
scene of the murder was Richardson's
saloon, the weapon with which It was
done a 3S-caliber bulldog revolver of ob
solete pattern, the bullet from which en-
red the dead woman's head at the left
temple, killing her Instantly.
The murderer was placed under arrest
by Officer Askew, who arrived on the
scene a few seconds after the fatal shot
was fired. John J. Brownlee, who re
cently returned from Manila In the Gov
ernment transport service, was the sole
witness to the affair, and was also taken
into custody. The stories of the two men
differ widely upon certain points, but
both agree that the shooting was done
In self-defense. A heavy iron bung
starter, which was lying at the dead
woman's side, when Officer Askew arrived,
In a measure bears out their contention.
Concerning the affair Brownlee said;
"Richardson and his wife had been
quarreling till the evening over trivial
family affairs. They, in fact, spent most
of their time quarreling, and orr three or
four occasions Mrs. Richardson has bad
her husband arrested on different charges.
She had him- arrested about . five weeks
ago for beating her, but later had him
released. They got pretty angry, and
finally Mrs. Richardson told her husband
he could quit her whenever he wanted to
and he said it would take little to make
him do it.
"With that;" continued Brownlee, "she
picked up the bungstarter and said
, I'll beat your brains out, but made
no atlvance toward him. Richardson pulled
his gun from his coat pocket, and l shoved
it aside and told him not to be a fool.
Ills wife was landing at the end of the
bar and he was behind It. Then she
waved the bungstarter at him again and
he red. That was the only shot fired,
but -it killed her Instantly. She dropped
where she stood."
According to Brownlee's further story,
Richardson then placed the gun to his
own lead and was about to take his life
when Brownh c jumped across the bar and
held his hand, telling him at the same
time that there was no need of it, as his
wife w as still alive. Richardson shoved
the gun at him and told him to gel back,
at the same time saying, "1 could not help
it: 1 had to do It."
At this point Officer Askew came in and
Richardson threw his gun under the bar
and submitted to arrest. At the police
station he said In his own defense that
his wife precipitated the quarrel that re
sulted in her death, and that she attacked
him and struck him with the bungstarter
which v. is Found at her side. He said
he warded off the. first blow, but that
"she fame at him again," and in self-de
fense he was "obliged to fire."
Neighbors of the pair say that they
were constantly lighting, and that some
times one and sometimes the other x,<>'.
the best nf their hand to hand encounters,
and that the tragic end last night was
only to be expected. Richardson was for
merly a whaler and had the reputation of
being a brutal man among the men. of his
crew, and since he bought his saloon last
May he ha earned the me reputation
among his customers. Both he and his
wife were hard drinkers and disturbing
elements In the community. -
CALIFORNIA NOT YET
TO BE QUARANTINED
CONSUMPTIVES NOT BARRED
FROM THE COAST.
State Board of Health Rejects All
Propositions to Close the Gates
of the State.
The project to quarantine California
against consumptives of other States is a
dead issue. Last night's meeting of the
State Board of Health at. the Grand Hotel
settled that proposition, despite a long
and- excellently prepared paper In support
of the a sure which was read by Dr.
Crowley, the drafter of the original reso
lution.
Dr. Crowley's original resolution, which
shut out from the benefits of California's
altitudes and climate the sick of every
Other State (if the Union, gave way to a
resolution which accomplished nothing
under present conditions and Which meant
nothing of any .moment to any one to
whom climate and California might mean
anything.
Dr. Bazet of this city stood as the
champion of the sick and did so strongly.
He said that not a country In Europe, -not
a State in the Union, bad ever attempted
to close its gates to those who might have
need to enter, and he for one would not
he the first of all the world to vote for
such a measure. With this extreme view
Dr. Buggies agreed. Dr. .Matthews took
the middle position that he was not at
the time prepared to vote for so radical a
proposition, but at the same time would
not say that he might not do so at a fu
ture opportunity, lie thought the com
promise resolution offered by Dr. Crow
ley was a step In the right direction and
would vote for that, providing no mention
of quarantine was included. Dr. Nutting,
the. president, took that stand, and when
the resolution came to a vote It was car
ried unanimously.
Dr. Crowley's resolution accomplished
one thingâ segregation of tuberculous
patients- from the non-tuberculous in all
State Institutions. It reads as follows:
Resolved, That the California Board of
Health considers tuberculosis to be a dan
gerously infectious disease, acquired prin
cipally through the Inhalation of desiccated
tuberculous sputum and. to a lesser degree,
by the means of tuberculous milk and meat!
Resolved. Whereas tuberculosis Is the
means of causing- frcm. one-seventh to one
fifth of all the deaths In California cities
that the State Hoard of Health shall con
tinue its investigations further for the pur
pose of suggesting to the State and local
authorities sanitary regulation's that will
materially decrease the mortality from
tuberculosis, also that li (the State" Hoard)
will as expediently as possible carry into
effect any sanitary law of which ft lias
control 'that may be the means of lessening
the ravages 'â¢: the disease.
Resolved, That it is the opinion of th*
State Hoard of Health that the great number
of tuberculous people entering our State
and congregating in our cities which have
little or no sanitary regulations ls a menace
to the health and lives of non-tuberculous
persons: and
Resolved further,^ That the board recom
mends that In all State Institutions Where
people are confined the tuberculous people be
segregated In a separate maid or building
tram the non-tuberculous.

SAID TO HAVE . BEEN INFLU

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 10.- Edward Nolan.
Mary A. Loughmane, Lucy Deegan and
thirty-six other nieces and nephews of
Hannah Smith, deceased, to-day began
suit in the Superior Court against Patrick
W. Rlordan. Archbishop of the diocese of
San Francisco of the Roman , Catholic
Church, to recover possession of about
$60,000 worth of property deeded to the
church prior to the death of decedent
Mrs. Smith, who was the widow of
Thomas P. Smith, died In this county on
January 4, 1894. Up to her death she was
a communicant of St. .Patrick's Church. in
this city, presided over by Father P. J.
Dowling. On June 28, 1887, seven years
before her. death, she deeded to Father
Dowling 460 acres of land on the road be
tween Alviso and Milpitas and lots 5, 6
and ' In Dathrop's Adidtion, on Thir
teenth and Charles streets. The deed was
recorded two years later.
The complaint alleges that Father
Dowling was for a long time prior to Mrs.
Smith's making the deed the intimate and
confidential friend and associate and spir
itual adviser as well as confessor of Mrs.
Smith; who was an ardent and zealous
religionist of the Roman Catholic Church.
It states that at all times .Mrs. Smith
was absent from her home she was In
soeietv if Father Dowling, seeking ad
vice and guidance in spiritual and tem
poral matters; that said Father Dowling
with design sedulously taught and In
structed Hannah Smith that if she would
give her estate to him In trust for the
church it- would greatly elevate her In
the esteem of the church and assure her
salvation in the world to come. It is
also alleged that at the time of her death
she was possessed Of personal property
consisting of horses and cattle and $5000
In money, which Father Dowling took
possession of.
Plaintiffs allege that said deed of con
veyance was in the nature of a trust and
without valuable consideration, and was
Intended by Mrs. Smith simply to invest
title in her property to Father Dowling
and the Catholic church until her death,
and state that up to her demise she had
undisturbed possession of the property.
Father Dowling died on January 12, 1894,
a few days after Mrs. Smith's death, and
the complaint states it Is believed that
hip death resulted from the effects of a
severe cold caught while attending Mrs.
Smith's funeral. Two days before his
death Father Dowling deeded the prop
erty to Patrick W. Riordau for the Cath
olic church.
The complaint further states that
for some time plaintiffs have been try
ing to effect a settlement with Archbishop
Rlordan, and that at one time Attorney
G R B. Haves, counsel for the Arch
bishop, offered the heirs 60 per cent of all
the property left by said Hannah Smith
In settlement of their claims, and they ac
cepted the same, but during the past two
months Archbishop Rlordan has refused
to keep his word in regard to the settle
ment. . . , .-.
The plaintiffs pray that judgment be
given them for the land and property and

ITALIAN FAIR AN
ASSURED SUCCESS
The Bazaar in Aid of Sts. Peter and
Paul Church Opens Under Auspi
cious Circumstances.
Washington Square Hall has been con
verted Into a veritable fairyland by the
fair members of Sts. Peter and Paul
Church. Beautifully decorated booths and
pretty girls dressed in parti-colored cos
tumes were attractive features at the ba
zaar which was opened on Monday by
Mayor Phelan. The fair was planned and
carried into execution by the members of
the well-known Italian church, and gives
every promise of being the success that
Its inductors look for.
The funds derived from the. bazaar are
to be used in a worthy cause. With the
money thus obtained the debt on the
church will be materially decreased and
the work of the Saleslitn Fathers among
the youths of this city will be advanced.
A number of prettily decorated booths
meet the visitors' eyes as they enter the
hall. In the center is the Neapolitan
booth, which is decorated in the Italian
colors and over which is a huge Japanese
umbrella surrounded by Chinese lanterns. :
The Japanese booth, a symphony In bam
boo, lanterns and chrysanthemums, makes
one of the most inviting nooks In the hall.
The young ladies In charge are attired In

THE SAIN FKANCISCO CALL- WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, IS**".
WILL CONNECT,
ALASKAN CITIES
Telegraph Line Planned
to Juneau.
TO BE READY NEXT FALL
* .
PROMOTERS OF THE SCHEME
HAVE A GOOD BACKING.
BY h|f.L HOFFMAN.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 5 (via Seattle,
Wish., Oct: 10).â The year 1900 will bring
â¢otuiderable telegraphic . development to
Alaska. This city will in all probability
lave telegraphic communication with the
.vorld at large by next fall and with
Skaguay early next spring. In fact,
Juneau will be in telegraphic touch with
he rest of mankind just as soon as Daw
son and Skaguay.
Robert L. Moore, chief inspector of the
Western Union office at Victoria, B. C,
representing a company to be known as
the British Columbia and Alaska Tele
graph Company, has been here several
lays working up the project. Mr. Moore
proposes to use the Edison phonoplex sys
.em, laying a cable from Juneau to Skag
jay, a distance of 100 miles, over which it
s said .he. phonoplex system will work
eery satisfactorily, lt is proposed to have
he cable In operation next March. Mr.
Moore wants the business interests of Ju
ieau to subscribe to take a total of $10,000
worth of coupons, good for that much
>usin< over the line, the coupons to be
lelivered and paid for when tne cable is
n successful operation. He is meeting
ivith encouragement.
The Canadian Government has already
completed a telegraph line from Lake
Bennett to Dawson and from Taglsh to
Atlin City, where an Office has been
>pened. An appropriation of $400,000 has
men made for the purpose of stringing a
.vire from Quesnelle, on the Eraser River,
.'OO miles north of Ashhroft, B. C, to At
m, and cords of wire are now said to be
piled v.[> at Ashcroft. As early next
spring as possible two gangs of men will
â¢â¢â  put to work, one at the Quesnelle end
md the other at the Atlin, and they are
expected to meet where in the in
terior next fall and- join wires. Thai mo
ment Juneau; Skaguay and Dawson will
ease to be Isolated places of the north,
rhey will, so far as communication is con
denied, be just as close to New York and
London as Seattle or San Francisco.
The Dominion Government will use sev
eral hundred miles of the old telegraph
trail and survey, which was a Jay Gould
md Western Union scheme to put an over
land wire through Siberia to St. Peters
burg and Europe. This was defeated by
the completion of the Cyrus W. Field ca
ble across the Atlantic. Several million
dollars were lost and tons of wire were
left on the ground. Some of it is there
yet.
Some speculation has been Indulged in
here and at Skaguay already as to the
combined press rate to be charged by the
several lines. From Juneau the British
Tolumbia and Alaska Telegraph Company
will probably ask one cent a word to
Skaguay, according to Mr. Moore. The
White Pass and Yukon line to Bennett, or
ragish. must have something, and that
may be another cent. Then the Dominion
Government will probably want at least
a. cent for the long jump from Tagish to
Asia toft, and just to keep things uniform
ii, Western Union or other company that
led vers the stuff to its destination in the
States may fix its slice at one cent. This
makes 4 cents a word, or $4 per 100 wordsâ
which rate must be considerably lowered.
->r there will â â  â â 'â â ]â¢â  lie very little press
matter get overland. The commercial rate
wai proDably we oik enough at birth to
stand alone.
G. B. Bwinehart of Juneau, the well
known newspaper man of Alaska, was in
the field here several weeks ahead of Mr.
Moore with a subscription paper for an
overland line, to be ready In a year, be
tween Juneau and Skaguay. and secured
about 18000 in subscriptions. . The Swine
hart proposition has interfered with the
British Columbia and Alaska Company,
but one or the other of the lines will
doubtless be stretched next year.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MOJAVE, Oct. 10.â A fire which started
at S o'clock last night totally destroyed j
the business portion of this town. One
store remains, but not a saloon, hotel or
lodging-house except the one run by Fred
Harvey at the depot. The brick building
occupied by A. A slier, merchant, and W.

two explosions of giant powder. Prac
tically nothing was saved from the sa
loons, stores and hotels.
The fire started in the Southern Pacific
freight sheds and the wind, blowing at ]
sixty miles an hour, carried the fire
across the wide street and started fires-
In the frame structures on the main
thoroughfare. The railroad company
succeeded in saving the depot hotel build
ings. Cows, horses and dogs were burned
but no human lives were lost. The fire
is supposed to be of Incendiary origin.

FLAMES THREATEN
BOHEMIAN GROVE
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 10.â Word was re
ceived here this afternoon from Guerne
ville that the. forest fires raging In. that '
section were heading for the famous Bo- j
hemian Grove, the beautiful spot pur- ;
chased by the Bohemian Club last year. j
The club's officers were communicated \
with and seventy-five men were put to |
work fighting the flames, with the result ;
that they are now practically under con
trol.
SAX JOSE, Oct. 10.â There was no wind
last night, and In some portions of the
gulches and mountains there was a good
deal of fog. As a result, the tire burning
near Wrights this morning* seemed to be
dying out. The fear now is that a high
wind this afternoon may drive it far and
wide again. A telephone message at noon
from Wrights said that there was still tire
in Austin Gulch and Soquel Canyon, but
SCOUT FERGUSON
BRAVEST OF ALL
Â© Â«- NOTEWORTHY figure in the ranks
A jl \\ of the returning regiment of Kan
'' W Wsas volunteers is Ferguson, private
â 7 and scout. According to the stories
() told by members of the South Dakota
-it soldiers upon their return to this city
A from Manila, Ferguson is entitled to a
V very large ' share of the glory of the
* famous exploit accomplished -by . the
Q Kansans of crossing a swift and unford
-* able river In Luzon under the leadership
A of the intrepid Colonel (now General)
jÂ£ Funston. When the Kansas' Regiment
* came to the river they found that the
Q bridge had been nearly destroyed and
-* that it was seemingly sure death to
A venture upon it. All the roadway of the
_Â£ structure had been torn up by the Flli
"^ pinos and all that remained of the super-
Q structure consisted of the narrow iron
â¢ie beams on either side, to which the floor-
A ing or roadway had originally been bolted.
V Upon the farther side of the river, the
â fc Filipinos were concealed, and occupied
A such a strong position that the deadly
_Â£ fire of their guns could sweep the bridge
"v clear of any person who tried to walk
0 across. The Filipinos evidently did not
-It anticipate the tactics of Ferguson. Strip-
A ping. himself, that his motions might be
V unimpeded and that he might have some
j chance to escape by swimming if he
Q should fall Into the river, Ferguson took
-it a rope arid crawled carefully out upon the
A side of the bridge farthest from the Fiji
v pinos. His progress was slow and the
"? bullets rattled dangerously near him, but
y he managed to gel across and actually
-fc escaped the notice of the Filipinos .when
A he had reached the land, so skillfully had
_, he managed the affair. He was able then
v to help his comrades over by the use of
Q the rope he find carried, they using rafts,
1/ which they pulled over by the rope. This
fc story differs from the story that came
A In th" dispatches to some extent, y
L but it Is derived from the testimony of eye-witnesses of the whole occurrence, *
T The South Dakotans said that Ferguson performed the most daring act of A
0 the Filipino war. V
that it was seemingly tinder control. The ;
fire is burning steadily toward Loma.
Prieta, but it Is difficult to get exact word,
as that section is remote from communi
cation. ... ,
What word goes out will probably reach
Watsonville first. Up to 12 o'clock to-day
no additional damage since last night had
occurred In the territory near Wrights.
The lire has spread north toward the
great basin section. Much timber has been
damaged, and if the fire gets a thorough
hold in the underbrush in the great basin
valuable commercial timber to a vast
amount may go.
There is no alarm at Los Gatos, as it
would be almost impossible for the fire to
reach that place, no matter how much it
might spread. Lumber men here who own
redwood forests In and near the great
basin are not alarmed, but so far to-day
no additional word has been received since
yesterday afternoon. This is construed to
mean that the, watchers have not found
it necessary to go out to telephone.
While some of the estimates of loss run
way up to half a million dollars, many
persons hold that this Is too great, since
most of the section burned over was
largely mountain brush. But startling
word of further spread and destruction of
redwood timber may come at any time if
a gale springs up.

* - â â - '
SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT THE
KING'S PARTY.
â __Â»
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Oct. 8. - Death has re
moved another prominent and interesting
Hawaiian characterâ Hon. James Keau.
In early life Keau amassed' cdnslderble
property as a taro planter and poi-maker.
He was active, intelligent and industri
ous, had a fair share of executive abil
ity, and, like so many of his race, was a
fluent and forcible speaker. Having as
sisted In the organization of the Poola
Society, he had considerable political in
fluence. This society of "sun-heads," so
called through .their working in the 'sun
hatless, is composed principally of the
longshoremen, stevedores and other man
ual laborers. It is this society which, in
quaint garb of imitation feather capes,
holds the ropes and draws the funeral
hearse of royalty or very distinguished
or much-beloved citizens. - ; â 
This special influence made him quite a
prominent leader among his people, who
first sent him to the Legislature some
twenty years ago. He served them faith
fully, but it was in 18S6 that his power
over the people stood out most prom
inently. This was the election in which
the final stand was made by the King
Kalakaua party against the missionary
element. It' was before the days of the
Australian, ballot system, and the
voting tickets were but little bits of col
ored pasteboard. Each party . fought
its hardest.
The King voted "his soldiers In; uniform,
and the missionary element had bogus
dollars with beehives- on them, cashable
at a certain store for goods on certain
conditions. Gin flowed like water, luaus
were abundant.' Each side counterfeited
the other's' ballots. The King's party
bought up and gathered in the bogus dol
lars, and bribery was triumphant.
. Keau brought his patty through victo
riously, and. â¢ F. H. Hayselden, John T.
Baker, E. K. Ltlikani and Kean defeat
ed their opponents by a handsome ma
jority, and Walter Murray Gibson re
mained Premier In- spite of the Carter-
Castle- Waterhouse-Dole combination. The
result of this election, which nearly end
ed in a riot, was the overthrow of Mr.
Gibson in 1887 and the limitation of the
powers of the King by the new constitu
tion.
After the downfall Keau left the islands
for Tonga, but, Hawaiian like, he took
no necessary precautions for the . man
agement of his large estate, and on his
return, as a consequence, about two
years ago. he found that his estate had
vanished and he was but a poor man. His
funeral was attended by a very large
gathering of Hawaiian*.

HONOR ACCORDED
TO NAVAL HERO
Captain Chadwick Given
a Sword.
Special Disratch to The Call.
MORGANTOWN. W. Va., Oct. 10.-
Chadwick day was celebrated by 10.000
! people to-day. The weather was mag
nificent and country people came fortj
i and flftv miles overland. The special
! train with naval officers arrived at 6
I o'clock. A salute in honor of Admiral
Sampson was fired by the university
j cadets. In the party were Admiral I
i Sampson. Captain Chadwick and wife.
j Lieutenant C. C. Marsh and wife and j
Commander S. A. Staunton. Brigadier:
General. D. F. Splllman of Parkersburg,
W. Va,, was chief marshal of the parade.
I The procession was reviewed by
I the distinguished guests and then
dismissed. A meeting was called to
j order by Hon. G. Sturgls and Governor
| Atkinson presented the sword to Captain
1 Chadwick on behalf of the people of the
j State. Captain Chadwick was deeply |
' touched by the ovation accorded him and i
i replied as follows:
"Governor Atkinson: To say that I j
' come here. feeling deeply the kindness and â 
' honor bestowed by you is to exptess but |
' lightly the thoughts which fill my mind j
and heart ta being among the men and ;
! women and seeing the hills which were ;
! familiar scenes of boyhood. I thank j
I you for Â»-our splendid gift, the sentiment j
â  of which fulfills all to which I could ever ,
I aspire; for there is nothing in the lives of â¢
: men which can reach higher than the |
I honest, frank and spontaneous regard of ;
i those who knew them. This, I.know, is !
the limit of my own aspirations and I will
i say, for the comparatively small society
! of the navy In which I have passed most
; of my life that it is but rare to find an
officer whose first thought is not that of j
1 standing well with his fellow officers, to
have the good will, the esteem and honor!
â  of those who best know him.
"I accept the splendid gift. Governor
I Atkinson, which embodies the good will
Of so many kind friends, with heartfelt j
' gratitude; its possession binds me to the j
; highest tndeavor to fitly meet the ap- i
preciation, which you have so kindly j
dwelt upon."
The sword in dimensions corresponds !
I with naval regulations. The blade is of j
i the finest steel, decorated in gold, and

impromptu reception was held, lasting for i
an hour. The naval officers will remain
here several days as the guests of friends. !
RIVER MYSTERY
STILL UNSOLVED
Additional Parts of a
Body Found.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â Interest In the
murder mystery growing out of the find
ing of the left thigh of a woman's body
on West Seventeenth street last Satur
day was greatly Increased this morning
by the discovery of what is believed to be
another portion of the same body on
the beach at Quarantine Station, Staten
Island.
John Heineman, 12 years old, while
walking along the beach at Quarantine
at 7 o'clock this morning picked up a
package wrapped In newspapers and Man
ila Wrapping paper. He opened It and
found a piece of a woman's body from
the waist to the neck. He reported the
case to Dr. Doty, .the State Health Offi
cer, who made an investigation and re
ported that the flesh seemed quite fresh
and appeared to have been in the water
but a snort time.
There was a cut about two inches long
over the right breast, but this was merely
a flesh wound, and Dr. Doty said it did
not indicate the cause of death. The cuts
were jagged, showing- that the head had
probably been hacked off and the arms
had been cut oft close to the shoulders in
a clumsy manner. The police were noti
fied and took charge of the finding and
removed it to police headquarters, whence
it was taken to the morgue for compari
son with the parts of a woman's body al
ready there. â¢
A name that looks like "J. J. Nunan"
and the laundry mark "J. J. X., 188,"
were discovered this morning on one of
the white skirts in a bundle of clothing
found in the basement of 219 West Fif
teenth street. This house is next door to
an areaway in which stood the ashcan
where -the right thigh of the murdered
woman was found. The letters forming
the name are not distinct.
They are partly washed out and blurred.
The "J. J. N." of the laundry mark Is dis
tinct, however, and is expected to had to
the identification of the owner. It will
then be easy to learn whether or not she
was connected In any way with the crime.
Chief of Detectives McClusky said this
morning that the ease was as complete a
mystery as ever; that no point that would
go toward establishing Identification had
been made, and that was the first thing
necessary. It was true, he said, that a
number of clews had been run down, but
the case stands just as It did at the first
finding of the part of the body.
The fragment found by voting Heineman
was examined at the Morgue by Coro
ner's Physician Weston, who says it un
doubtedly belongs to the other "two por
tions there.
Captain McClusky said this afternoon
that the bundle of clothing found in West
Fifteenth street belonged to a professional
nurse. Â« â  â¢ . ' â¢ .

Escaped From a Reform School.
Arthur Otts, a boy of 18 years of age,
who escaped from the Prescott, Reform
School about eighteen months ago. was
arrested Saturday while at work in
Ames & Harris' factory and taken to the
C, i y Prison. gHe had been sent to the
school from Oakland. Judge Graham in
terested himself in the boy's case and en
deavored to get the- police to let him
alone, as he was earning an honest liv
ing. but they could do nothing and he
was sent back to the school yesterday.
CONTRACTS ARE
REPUDIATED
Immigrants Resort to
Technicalities.
TROUBLE AT HONOLULU
ISLANDS WILL SEND EXHIBIT
TO PARIS.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
HONOLULU, Oct. 3.-Trouble has al
ready been occasioned by the arrival of
the latest batch of European immigrants
those brought from Portugal by the
steamer Victoria. This morning nine of
the Spaniards, after spending a day or
two at their plantation near town, de
cided that, they did not like the work and
consequently quit and came into town.
They repudiate their contracts on the
grounds that they are Spanish subjects
and the contracts were made in Portugal
and are not binding upon them. For the
present this matter is being discussed be
tween the acting Vice Consul for Spain
and the plantation agents. â â : â 
Another difficulty nas also arisen with
six Portuguese stowaways brought by tne
same ship. They were allowed to land on
condition that they would contract to
work on the plantation. They now re
pudiate their contracts on the ground that
they are minors. This affair is also re
ceiving consular investigation before pro
ceedings will be instituted. The outlook
is regarded as ominous even by conserva
tive men as tending to disparage the suc
cess of negotiations for European immi
gration, unless some means can be dis
covered to protect the planters after tho
arrival of the men and families who have
been brought here at their expense.. It is
thought that these two instances show
that advantage will be taken to obtain
tree passage to the islands, and then by
the repudiation of the contracts the ai
rivals will â¢â  do other work or steal or
starve rather than do the work for which
they have been engaged. ,'.*_..
It has now been definitely arranged that
Hawaii will exhibit at the Paris Exposi
tion as a territorial portion of the united
States. Hon. William G. Irwin, a promi
nent banker, will be the formal Commis
sioner to Paris, while Major George C.
Potter, secretary of the Foreign Office
and a member of the President's military
staff, will be the active local Commis
sioner. The merchants guarantee a fund
of $12,000 for expenses and the Govern
ment affords all the clerical help for col
lecting and arranging. " --â¢
Smaller shippers and retail dealers. are
becoming very much embarrassed by the
lack of freight steamer accommodation
from the coast, especially for perishable
goods. They claim that San Francisco
shippers inform them that it is impossible
to fill their orders owing to want of facili
ties for shipment. â  â¢ ' -;' .
The executive order in regard to public
lands and registration of vessels has
caused the merchants to ask by what
right President Dole still continues to col
lect, duties from importers for goods
shipped from the mainland here. There
is no Federal official to superintend the
collections, and to define them as muni
cipal taxation appears to be rather
stretching the limits of legal definitions,
the merchants contend.

A Robber Stabbed.
An attempt at robbery on the water
front last night resulted in the stabbing
of John Hogan, one of the lawbreakers.
The prospective victim and the man who
did the cutting was William M. Fostrum,
a miner and recent arrival from
Tuolumne. County.* Hogan's wounds
were not very serious, and after treat
ment at the Harbor Hospital he was
booked with a "pal" for robbery.
About JO o'clock last night Fostrum was
walking along East street. As he ap
proached the corner of Washington street
he was attacked by John Hogan and Al
bert Ryder, both water front "rounders.'*
He was knocked from his feet and the
two men- started to go through his pock
ets. Hogan was standing over his victim
when Fostrum suddenly drew a knife and
stabbed him three times in the head and
upper body. Both men were charged
with robbery.

FIGHTING FRED FUNSTON AND HIS GALLANT REGIMENT,
THE TWENTIETH KANSAS, ARRIVE ON OVERDUE TARTAR
Four Hundred Discharged Regu
lars Are on Board.
Small-Sized Mutiny Breaks Out Among the
Troops in Hongkong on Account of
Condition of Ship,
; if iHE overdue transport Tartar
plowed her way into the bay
early last evening and anchored
â¢far out in the stream. On board
,-^ la the heroic Brigadier General
funston. his gallant regiment, the Twen
tieth Kansas, and about 450 discharged
men from the Fourteenth and Twenty
third infantry and the Third Artillery.
Fighting Fred Funston, or the "Three
Fs." as his sobriquet goes in the army,
returns with the honors if war sitting
full upon him and he bears his reputa
tion well. For two days the wires have
been kept hot by the many friends of
the Kansas Regiment and the Inexplic
able delay of the Tartars arrival was
tne cause of much anxiety on the pa of
friends and relatives of those on board ;
When the ship was sighted about t>
o'clock last night, the news was sent
Immediately to the reception parties v. in
this city, but owing to the rougn weather
on the bay last night ail visits to the
ship were postponed until to-day
As soon as the Tartar entered the har
bor she was boarded by the quarantine
officers. As she has a clean bill of health
the ship will dock some time to-day. On
the trip across the Paciiic the ship hos
pital, which accommodates about twenty
five men, was taxed to its capacity, but
the majority of cases were not serious.
Three men died on the Journeyâ a private
of the Third Artillery and two Kansas
Boldlers, one in Company L and the other
In Company F. Two other bodies were
brought over from Manila, men In the
Nineteenth Infantry.
The Tartar left Manila on September 3
and arrived at Hongkong on the 6th. She
was held over eight days at that place,
being drvdocked at the Aberdeen yards.
In Hongkong the discharged soldiers at
tempted a small-sized mutiny, refusing to
return on the ship unless they were given
better quarters and the ship cleaned.
Consul General Wildman was brought
Into the squabble and through his inter
ference the ship was overhauled. The
soldiers returned^ and no further disturb
ances of any kind marred the trip. From
Hongkong the Tartar sailed to Yoko
hama and there the Kansas men tasted
of the pleasures of Japanese life. This
was her --â¢ stopping place and the trip
across the Pacific was -made In sixteen
days. Â«
A few days out from Yokohama a
heavy storm was met. but no serious
damage was done other than the delay
of the ship's arrival.
General Funston returns with his wife.
"I am in good health," he said last nig-ht.
"and you may say It with c-?rta nty that
lam hap; to get back to my own coun

the future I have not as yet determined.
I shall wait in san Francisco until I re
ceive instructions from Washington. No,
I cannot say that I will return to service.
though I mis do so. Mv mind is not
yet made up and m - : -h will d ped upon
circumstances.- These few w,):d: were
shouted from the upper deck, where tne
general, surrounded by some of his staff.

darkness in order to make himself heard
and fix his position.
BRILLIANT RECORD OF
THE KANSAS BOYS
Equaled by Few. .Beaten by None,
the Sunflowers Return From
the War.
Whatever may have been the impression
created by the men of the Twentieth
Kansas Repiment on their first appear
ance in the streets'of this city, there is
now most certainly but one opinion as to
their fighting qualities not only in San
Francisco but all over the United States,
and in Europe as well. When they were
first seen here as they marched from the
ferry' to Camp Merritt after a railroad
Journey half across the continent there
was little In their general appearance as
a bod: to give a forecast of what they
were going to do on the fighting line when
the opportunity offered. They had started
on hurry orders from their State camp
near Topeka. where they had been poorly
sheltered and badly provided for; their
uniforms as a rule were poor and worn,
and many of them had none at all. Rifles,
too, w-re missing from many shoulders.
The feelings created in the minds of most
people were therefore rather in the line of
sympathy.
But uniforms and guns don't make sol
diers. With all the lack of the essential
elements the men were there and their
after career proved that they were the
kind of men. too, of whom good soldiers,
the best in the world, are made.
They proved this at the first opportunity
and every subsequent one that offered.
The monotonous routine of camp duties,
the tiresome and exacting drills and the
unusually long sea voyage to Manila on
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE IDOL OF THE TURF.
The Most Popular Jockey in America j
and England Recommends
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
No Jockey has ever appealed so strongly
to public favor as Tod Sloan.
He has achieved more than his most
noted predecessors ever attempted and
stands in a class by himself.
Not satisfied with his successes in his
native country, he went to England and
now his fame as a successful horseman ls
on the tip of every tongue not only in
this country and England, but in every
section of the globe where racing has
found favor.
When Tod first went to England his
temerity was openly laughed at, but the
little American played skittles with his
English rivals and his victories made all
England gasp.
Having the stamp of royal approval,
society both at home and abroad "lion-
toe" him and he is feted and petted to an
extent that would turn an ordinary mor-
tal's head.
The great Jockey was In such demand
socially and dined and wined to such an
extent that it was feared his health
would give way. Too much society and
the nervous strain of racing told on him.
A two weeks' trip to America made him
acquainted with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets and their remarkably restorative ef-
fects on a depleted digestive apparatus
and he recommended them In unstinted
terms to a friend, saying: "Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are the best thing I know
of for keeping the stomach in condition
and appetite in good repair."
Thousands of former dyspeptics can
vouch for the truth of Tod Sloan's words,
as "Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets'' have be-
come a household word In America, and
few families are without them. One or
two taken after meals keep the stomach I
sweet by causing prompt and healthy dl-
gestion of the food.
. Perfectly healthy people use them after
heavy dinners to keep their good health
and to make sure that no 111 effects will !
follow an unusually hearty meal. '
Your druggist will tell you or your doc- ,
tor either that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets \
are composed only of digestive ferments.
Asceptlc Pepsin. Hydrastis, fruit acids. I
etc., and for the strong stomach as well ;
as the most delicate constitute a safe-
guard against indigestion and stomach
troubles
i poor fare. too. and under a tropic sun,
were all cheerfully taken by them as mat
ters of course; as part of their soldier
! life. When the quieter incidents of per
' manent camp and quarter life gave way
to the sterner ones of the active cam
paign, the long marches, the almost con
tinuous lighting, supperless eds on the
j hare wet ground, or the dangerous vigil
; of the picket post, cheerfulness in per
formance of duty became eagerness to
do everything and all that could be done.
Wherever It was, and whatever the work
ahead there was neither flutter nor fear,
| with either officers or men of the Twen
i tieth Kansas.
! Tlie Kansas Regiment arrived in San
Francisco May 20 and 21st under charge
of their lieutenant colonel. Little. Colonel
Funston who had been appointed to the
command, being detained for a time on
duty at General Miles' headquarters. They
remained here until October 30, when they
: sailed on the transport Indiana for Ma
; nila, where they arrived after a very te
dious voyage of several days longer than
that of the Tennessee regiment which left
here en the Zealandia three days after
them, the delay causing no little concern
both In Manila and here at home.
They were assigned to General H. G.
Otis' brigade of Mac Arthur's division,
with the First Montana, Third Artillery,
acting as infantry, and the Tenth Penn
sylvania. The American lines followed
very nearly those held by the Spaniards
against the insurgents, extending from
the bay 6hore near Tondo on the north,
around the city to Malate, near the bay
on the south. Otis' brigade held the left
of this line, facing the division of the In
surgent army under General Luna, who
had his headquarters at Caloocan.
Though exposed to tire on the sth and
fith of February' when the heavy fighting
was going on along all the rest of the
American line, the Kansas boys, much to
their chagrin, were comparatively idle,
! the Insurgents making no such showing
! in their front as before most of the other
regiments. On February 7. however, they
advanced toward Caloocan and a recon
l noltering party having developed a force '
j of the enemy which was making an effort |
to cut them off. Colonel Funston with a
i part of his command made a dash at them j
and quickly drove them within their In- I
; trenehme-nts. In this engagement the gal- j
; lant young lieutenant, Alfred C. Afford '
of Company B. with one other man, was ;
, killed and eleven wounded.
Caloocan was the most strongly forti
fled place held by the Insurgents on the
whole island and was said to be gar
risoned by 10,000 of the best troops in
Aguinaldo's army. On February 10 Gen
eral Otis' brigade was ordered to advance
against it. The Kansas boys, on the ex- ,
treme left, with the Montanas and Third ,
Artillery In the center and right, began ;
the movement about 4 p. m.. and at o:30 j
the American flag was floating from the
only flagstaff In the place, and the Fili
pinos were in full retreat toward Malabon
and the Tullahan River. Though under
Are from the very start the Kansas regi- ;
ment advanced rapidly through the j
thickets and across the paddy fields, until '
within a short distance of the intrench- '
! ments, from which a heavy fire was be- !
Ing poured into them, when they started j
on the run, and with their yell, which
carried panic to the hearts of the Fili
pinos, went right up and over the em
bankments ana on after the fleeing ene- i
my through the town. Their loss on this
occasion was but one man killed, though I
thirteen were wounded, Including several
officers.
During the next six weeks, while prep
arations for Mac Arthur's movement to
ward Malolos were being perfected, the
Twentieth Kansas held the lines on the
west and north of Caloocan, every day
exchanging Are with the enemy, and on
several occasions, February 22. 23, 27 and
28 and March 11 and 13 being quite sharp
ly engaged and losing several killed and
a dozen or more wounded, among the
former being Captain D. S. Elliott of
Company G.
On March 24 Mac Arthur's division be
gan the movement northward, which for
the Kansas regiment and their officers,
headed by the bold and dasning Fun
ston, was one blaze of glorious achieve
ment from the start at Caloocan to the
finish at the capture of Fernando seven
weeks later. As before, Otis' brigade
formed the left wing of the American ;
advance, with the Kansas boys generally ;
on the left of their brigade, where they
saw a full share of all the fighting that
was done.
Between Caloocan and Mevacanayan.
where it rested on the night of March 26.
the regiment lost five men killed and
nineteen wounded. On the 27th, at Mlrl
lao River, it lost four killed and five
wounded. Mirllao was occupied the next
day. and on the 29th the advance was con
tinued through Bocave and Bigao to Gui
guinto, within three miles of Malolos.
Aguinaldo's capital, the Kansas Regiment
being on the left and west of the railroad.
The enemy made some show of resistance
at every favorable opportunity and gave
battle In force at Guiguinto, but without
avail, for they were promptly "rushed"
out of their trenches at the point of the
bayonet and with panic-breeding yells by
the Americans. This part of the move- i
ment cost the Kansans three men killed !
and twenty-three wounded out of a total
of seventy for the day on the American
side.
it was at Mirllao River that Colonel
Funston gave the first exhibition of the
amphibious qualities of himself and his
men. The bridge having been broken and
the enemy being strongly intrenched on
the opposite side, preventing its repair,
he took twenty of his men and going a
short distance below swam the river,
carrying their guns and accouterments,
and flanking the enemy drove them from
their trenches, with the capture of eighty
prisoners. At Guiguinto the Filipinos had
partly destroyed the railroad bridge and
Intrenched themselves on the opposite
bank to prevent a crossing, but the Kan- i
sans were not to be stopped. Followed by j
the Pennsylvanlans, tney worked' their I
way over the bridge, under a heavy Are, i
and soon had the enemy again on the run. j^
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1899.
BRIGADIER-GENERAL FRED. FUNSTON.
(By courtesy of The Campaigning in the Philippines Company.)
After a rest of one day at Guiguinto the'
advance on Malolos was taken Dp again
at 7:30 o'clock on the morning; of the 31st. j
and by 'â > o'clock the American flag was
floating over the. plaza In the late capital
of the Filipinos. The Kansas Regiment
had the left of the line, as usual, but did j
not sustain as heavy loss as some other
regiments of the attacking force, losing
but one killed and one wounded. Their
end of the line was kept well forward all
the time and Colonel Funston with a part
of his command were the first American
troops to enter the city. The Montanans.
coming in by another street, raised the
flag on one side of the plaza as the Kan
sans passed over the other In pursuit of
the flying enemy.
In the advance from Malolos to Calum
pit on May 24 the Kansas regiment had
the right of the railroad. while their
fighting mates, the Montanas, had the
left, General Wheaton commanding the
brigade.
Calumplt was not only strongly forti
fied, but was held by a larger force of
the enemy than had been encountered
by the * Americans- before, estimated at
over 13,000 men. It was protected on the
north, east and south by the Calumpit
and Bagbag rivers, the banks of which
were covered with lines of trenches. On
the 25th the Kansas and Montana troops
drove the enemy from the outer line of
trenches on the east side of the Bagbag
River, and the next day, crossing over
the bridge, which had in the meantime
been repaired, drove the enemy from
their inner works and captured the
southern part of the city, while Hale's
column was attending to the northern
part.
On their retreat across the Rio Grande
the insurgents broke down a good part
of the iron railroad bridge, the only
means of following them, and gathering
their forces on the west side began to use
their artillery on the Americans. Colonel
Funston. with the approval of his supe
riors, called for volunteers to effect a
crossing, and selecting the few desired
from the large number that offered, pro
ceeded in the night to try the passage on
the broken down Ironwork of the rail
road bridge. The feat was a hazardous
one, and if discovered while creeping over
the tangled and twisted Ironwork, would
have cost the life of every man In the
party. With eager readiness a number
of men volunteered to make a trial trip.
One was chosen, Sergeant Ferguson. In
the darkness, with the swift, deep river
below him. he worked his way cautiously
to the other side, saw that the enemy
were on the lookout for any such a move
and well prepared to annihilate them if
they tried it. On his report Colonel Fun
ston abandoned the project, to try an
other In daylight. The next morning,
again calling for volunteers and selecting
a hundred and twenty men from the
whole regiment, he proceeded to a point
a mile or more below the bridge and
made preparations to cross. Rafts large
enough to carry eight or ten men .each
were first built and volunteers called for
to carry over a rope and make It fast on
the other side. A large number stepped
forward; two were chosenâ Privates
White and Twombly. These breasted the
broad and deep river and made the line
fast on the opposite bank, right under
the guns of the enemy. The colonel and
the rest of the men crossed as rapidly as
possible, and climbing the bank caught
the enemy In flank, and although out
numbered ten to one put them on the
run toward the bridge, over which other
troops were crossing, and the victory was
complete.
General Luna sent his chief of staff to
the American lines with a flag of truce
to express his admiration of the feats of
the Kansas boys on this occasion, and
their colonel was made a brigadier on the
recommendation of the commanding gen
eral. In this action and the day before
the regiment had three men killed and
twelve wounded. .
On May 4 the advance was resumed, and
the brilliant work of the Kansas boys
continued, winding up the day with the
charge and capture of the enemy's works
at San Tomas, in which they lost Lieu
tenant McTaggart of Company G and four
men killed, and three officers and twenty
two men wounded. On May 19 General
Funston relieved General Wheaton in
command of the brigade, and Lieutenant-
Colonel Little took charge of the regi
ment.
On May 24 General Funston, with the
Kansas and Montana regiments, attacked
and dispersed a large force of insurgents
at Santa Rita, near Bacolor, with a loss
to his old regiment of two killed and
twelve wounded. This was their last se
rious piece of work, although they were
more or less under fire until they were
withdrawn from the front. Besides Its
losses of over a hundred and fifty men
killed and wounded In the campaign, the
hard work they had performed told se
verely on the health of the men. and by
the Ist of July the regiment had less than
450 men fit for duty. Yet there was no
complaint and no request for a rest. Un
stinted praise has been given to the men
of the Kansas regiment by all the re
turning volunteers. They indeed proved
themselves fit followers of their brave
leader, the gallant Funston.
FUNSTON'S CAREER.
Hero of the Filipino Campaign
and His Life's Action.
Though, like King Plpln. many Inches
short of the regulation size, Frederick
Funston has more than counted for a
man on every occasion with which his
name has been connected from a very
early period in his career. Deservedly
famous In certain fields before going to
the Philippines in command of the Twen
tieth Kansas Regiment, he there added
further achievement and desert to his
already brilliant record, until his name
and that of the fine regiment that fol
lowed him, without lessening the honors
won by any others, stand out in full
blaze of glory before the eyes of the
American, and are to them synonyms for
all that is bold In conception and daring;
in soldierly achievement. Any detailed
sketch of Funston's career In the Philip
pines would involve a daily record of the
whole campaign. Suffice it to say that as
a soldier he was always prompt in obe
dience to the orders of his superiors, yet

ready with respectful suggestion when he
saw it would benefit the service. As a
commander he was ever watchful of the
discipline and welfare of his men, and
their leader on the field. As a foe, the
Filipinos themselves have borne the high
est testimony a* to the vigor and firm
ness of his onslaughts.
Frederick Funston was born in Ohio in
1866, and so was only about 33 years of age
when he was made brigadier general. j
From his early boyhood his life has been
a series of varied and interesting ad
venture, always exhibiting the character
istics that have marked his career in the
Philippinesâ contempt for danger, but
without any element of foolhardy reck
lessness, quick perception of the necessi
ties of a situation and ready resourceful
ness to meet them, wonderful capacity for
physical exertion and endurance, coupled
with an almost tender concern for the wel
fare and comfort of those about him, and
a prudent persistency of purpose that is j
not often met with. At the age of 16,
while yet a schoolboy, he took the stump j
in behalf of his father's candidacy for j
Congress, and by his tactful boldness and j
knowledge of men succeeded in electing (
him In the face of strong opposition. After j
two years at the Kansas State University I
he was for a while assistant editor of a j
newspaper at Fort Scott. Kans., then a j
conductor on the Santa Fe railroad, then I
a member of scientific exploring expedi- j
tions in Dakota, California and Alaska,
and is said to be the only surviving sane i
member of the celebrated party which j
in 1891 underwent such terrible hardships |
in Death Valley. California. Soon after
the outbreak of the Cuban rebellion Funs- j
ton joined one of the filibustering expedi
tions, made his way to General Gomez's j
army, and entering* his service fought ,
with him for nearly two years, taking !
part in twenty-two battles. He was cap- j
tured by the Spaniards, but contrived to i
make his escape and reach the United
States. One of the sketches of his career j
In the Cuban army gives the following:
summary of the bodily injuries sustained
by him in action and from the Cuban cli- i
mate: "His left arm has been mutilated
for life by a shell, his. lungs pierced by a I
Mauser bullet, his thigh crushed by "his !
horse falling on him in battle and his" sys
tem racked and debilitated by the Cuban |
fevers."- Add to all these his wound at i
Gulguinto and the effects of his exposure i
In the Filipino campaign, and one wonders j
how any one man not over five feet four
inches in height could find room to hold
so many mishaps: and yet he may be said
to, have just begun his real career, for the
people of Kansas are ready to open up to
his ambition anything in their gift.

WATER STORAGE.
IT is impossible to clothe the coming water storage
convention with any artificial importance. That
which it derives from the circumstances that make
it necessary is so great that its bare statement suffices.
Within the water storage policy lies the future of
California. The utilizing of the normal, un wasted
water has about reached its maximum. But for the
water now available -to irrigate one acre there runs
to waste, as harmful flood, enough to irrigate one
hundred acres.
More than this, when adequate reservoirs are pro
vided the supply of stored water becomes constant.
The rainfall for any decade is proved to be practically
invariable. The precipitation does not decrease in
any term of years as compared with any other similar
term of years. But when dry years come the normal
flow of water decreases and there is not enough left
for its expected service. In years of drought, there
fore, the current supply falls off, neighbor fights with
neighbor and community with community for the lit
tle that is left, fields go barren and orchards and
vineyards fail. Such was the experience of ancient
Egypt, the seat of the earliest irrigation by using the
overflow of the Nile. The inspiring story of the
dream interpreted by Joseph is simply a revelation of
the necessities of Egyptian ' agriculture dependent
upon water. The seven fat ears and the seven fat kine
were the years of plenty caused by abundant water.
The seven lean ears and the seven lean kine that
consumed the fat ones were the want and necessity
that fell upon the land when the water failed, in which
the wealth, and substance laid by in the fruitful years
were consumed. California undergoes the same ex
perience in every scries of dry years. The leanness
of the land causes the consumption of all the accu
mulations of the good years.
But in the good years the fat runs to waste in the
flood waters that would prevent the constantly re
curring consumption of these accumulations, and
they would go forward always, a steady aggregation
of wealth, if that waste were prevented.
The convention of the 14th of November next is to
consider the way? and means by which this waste may
be prevented and all the years be fat.
Within this policy of water storage lies the conser
vation of the forests. These are being reaped now by
fire. The State is under a pall of smoke that rises
from burning forests. . .
When reservoirs are made it will be discovered that
the forests are necessary to hold the soil upon the
mountain slopes, which unrestrained will slip and
wash into the reservoirs, filling and making them
tisclcss. - M .
Therefore ay who want the forests preserved, who
want the timber that is ripe and fit for commerce to
be so harvested as not to destroy the oncoming crop,
should take an interest in this convention. "The tree
is mother of the fountain," and that mother is being
burned to death to-day from one end of the State to
the other, and in her death the cool fountains perish.
The business men of every city in the State must
make this convention the first object of their interest
and support. Without the storage of flood water and
the preservation of forests the day will come when
there will be no business in California, as surely as it
came to the Promised Land, which Moses saw as a
land of milk and honey, filled with corn and wine,
but which by deforesting is now a blear desert, as dry
as the ashes' of the mothers of the fountain which
perished ages ago.

MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.
\A AYOR PHELAN commends his party for
I \ nominating him, which is an exhibition of or
* * dinary gratitude. He seems to be in a self
satisfied state of mind about it, because of his opinion
that he is so much better than his party that he asks
only its nomination, intending to get outside votes to
elect him. To do this he found it necessary for his
party to do the ostrich act and hide its head in the
sand. He said in his Metropolitan Hall speech last
August, "We must get control of the convention."
"We" did not mean that the Democratic party must
control a free convention, in which every man would
have a show and fair play, but that the Mayor
and his friends must control it. Well, "we" succeeded,
and after the Democratic convention met Mr. Phelan
proceeded to force it to pretend that it was not a
Democratic convention. It was compelled to put off
the lion skin of a national organization and appear in
the hide of an ass grown tired of thistles for food and
seeking better pasture. This change of individual
ity, this hiding from itself, this appearance in a mask,
produced one of the most violent and turbulent as
semblages ever seen in this city. A conventicle led
on thesandlots by Dennis Kearney in his high and
mighty days was a Quaker meeting compared to it.
At times the violence rose to such a pitch that Phelan
or his managers had to send for the police, and all
of the force that could be spared from the patrols was
present to prevent riot and bloodshed in Mayor
Phelan's fountain of good government! With the
temporary chairman barricaded behind the stag?,
while an enraged delegate stood on the platform call
ing him a liar and daring him to come out and take
a licking; with the convention exulting in an ecstacy
of riot and disorder, there was presented a forecast
of the style of government which will result from the
Mayor getting control of the convention.
The reading and thinking people need no informa
tion upon the style of good government supplied by
Mr. Phelan's party.
When Greater New York came under its new char
ter "we" got control of the convention there and se
cured the city government- The result has been so
nauseating that the city has retched and strained ever
since in an effort to throw up her new charter, and
her boroughs, greater boundaries and all. â 
Chicago enlarged her borders, greatened herself
and widened her phylactery. "We" got control of
the convention there and inaugurated a Democratic
city government, as did New York. The effect has
followed cause in Chicago. From Democratic testi
mony it is established that the municipal government
has risen no higher than its source, and it bites like
a blister every public and private interest it can
reach. In New York Van Wyck, in Chicago Carter
Harrison, posed as better than their party to secure
votes outside the party, just as Mr. Phelan poses
here, but when elected their obligations ran to the
pit out of which they were digged and thence came
the inspiration of their administration.
If "we" controlled the late Democratic municipal
convention and exhibited in it a reformed party, just
what must the party have been before it reformed?
Republicans and independent citizens have a plain
course before them. Horace Davis has served .in
every position creditably and usefully and cleanly.
He inherited no fortune, but owes all he has to his
own exertions. His life has been upright, moral and
of good example. It has been in no sense a double
life, and is undefiled. His public career is known to
his fellow citizens, and every hour of his private life
may be revealed with no stain nor transgression upon
it. In the" last analysis a man's character is deter
mined by what chance may reveal. Fortunate. i- he
who goes among men fearless of the keenest search.
The Republicans may well rejoice that such a man
heads their ticket. Upon his personal and political
soundness, his public spirit, his sympathy with all
men who, like himself, must begin in the winning of
their own fortunes, they build their policy as upon a
rock. The ticket which he heads is worthy of the
man who leads it. He has uttered no personalities
has ascribed no false motives, has not blurred the
issue with an exhibition of debauched ambition.
Representing the best and simplest in the private
and public life of California, he may well rely upon the
conviction that a majority of the people of this city
have careers, habits and character in common with
him.
With all the credit of "Lipton, Limited" and the
vast connections of the Iselins, it seems a little strange
that the owners of Shamrock and Columbia do
not succeed in raising the wind.
THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM
REPORTS from Philadelphia concerning the
successes of the export exposition are of a
nature to encourage and to stimulate the
efforts of those who have undertaken to establish in
this city a commercial museum for. the purpose of
facilitating our trade with foreign countries. No fea
ture of the exposition seems to have attracted more
attention from* practical business men, whether mer
chants or manufacturers, than those which by ex
hibiting the kinds of goods used in different countries
show in what direction we can most profitably em
ploy our energies in seeking commercial expansion.
The exhibits in the foreign sample department of
the exposition were" obtained partly by the Govern
ment and partly by the Philadelphia Commercial
Museum. Congress appropriated $50,000 for the work
and the Commissioners were engaged about fifteen
months in collecting the exhibits from all parts of the
I globe. In describing them the Philadelphia Record
! says:
"There are displayed in this exhibition considerably
more than 250,000 articles, including every class of
textiles for every market of the globe; hardware of
all descriptions, glassware, plated ware, boots and
! shoes, straw and felt hats, tinware, cutlery, harness
goods, jewelry, agricultural implements and other
j 'goods. Not only have the American agents suc
j ceeded in getting many specimens of the articles
! manufactured in the various countries, but have
| placed by the side of these the articles of the same
kind imported in these markets, so a? 16 give a com
prehensive object lesson to American manufacturers
; as to what these markets desire md what their com
petitors from other countries are furnishing for
j them." . ,
It has been announced that if the citizens of San
Francisco establish and maintain a commercial mu- '
: scum the authorities of the one in Philadelphia would
j co-operate with it and furnish out of the surplus there
', a considerable number of exhibits to start with. It
would be well to accept that offer promptly. From
1 the amount of interest which has been excited in the
I East by the exposition of exports it is certain more j
I than one city will be moved to establish a museum of j
! the kind and apply to Philadelphia for exhibits. If.
we delay the inauguration of the museum here we !
j may lose many a valuable collection of foreign goods
i that might otherwise come to us.
It is to be noted that an exhibit of the extent and
I variety now displayed at Philadelphia is not easily
I obtained. It is said it is the only collection of mer
THE SAN FRANCISCO {CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1899.
! chandise representing the products of the world ever
I gathered for the purpose of giving the exporter the
j opportunity of examining the goods marketable in
| foreign lands and with which he desires to place his
j own in competition. The difficulties of obtaining the
â  collection and its object were explained by William
, Harper, whose efforts brought about the co-operation
of the Federal Government with that of the Philadel
, phia Commercial Museum officials in the accumula
| tion of these so-called samples. Among the expe
riences narrated of the agents in getting them were a
'Â number of instances where the American Commis
! sioners were threatened with death for spying on the
i industrial secrets of various countries. In not a few
cases they were compelled to appeal to the American
. Consul for protection, and this official had to seek
' the assistance of the Government.
San Francisco of course looks forward to a vast
expansion of her commerce in the immediate future,
and, that being so, her merchants should be alert to
profit by the opportunity now afforded to start a com
| mercial museum under such favorable circumstances.
The promoters of the movement should urge it at
| once upon public attention.
rOR the purpose of equalizing library privileges
throughout the country there has been started
in New England a movement which has so much
to commend it that it merits immediate success. The
object is to procure an act of Congress permitting
circulating libraries to send books through the mails
as second class matter to such readers as may choose
to avail themselves of the privileges. The plan, it will
be seen, is perfectly feasible. It will do no more than
give to libraries the privileges now accorded to pub
lishing houses of mailing books at low rates.
The advocates of the movement advance many ar
guments in its favor. It is in harmony with the spirit
of the postal laws to diffuse good reading and to pro
mote the circulation of books that tehd to public en
lightenment; the spread of library advantages is in
timately connected with the diffusion of popular edu
cation; the people who maintain public libraries
under State or municipal laws are the same who main
tain the postal system under national laws; matter
now carried at second rate postage, or in some cases
carried free, has to such rating no claim superior to
that of the books of a public library; the plan will
promote the circulation of good books in districts
where no libraries exist; and, finally, it will put in
right relations two important public interests, the
postoffice and the public library, and thus render each
more serviceable than ever to the community.
The Call has repeatedly pointed out the many ad
vantages which have followed the adoption of the
traveling library system in New York and other East
ern States. The plan now proposed in New England
would supplement that system and would serve an
even wider field of readers. It would give to every
citizen within reach of a postoffice a fair opportunity
to profit by the libraries maintained at public ex
pense or supported by endowments from private
munificence. It would be, in fact, a public benefit
which would cost the National Government little or
nothing, and might, indeed, prove remunerative to
the postoffice.
Many of the leading libraries of the country have
given cordial approval to the enterprise. Not only
are the public libraries in favor of it, but even many of
those maintained without taxation would place their
books at the disposal of the people generally should
such a cheap system of postage be established. It ib
to be noted, moreover, that the scheme is not alto
gether novel, as a 1 similar system has been in opera
tion in some of the countries of Europe. Thus a let
ter on. the subject from the Minister of the Nether
lands says: "In the Netherlands books may go from
libraries of any kind by, mail at book or parcel rates
and the postman delivers the book without extra
charge at the door of the person to whom it is ad
dressed, even in the most remote rural parts of the
kingdom."
. The plan will be presented to Congress at the com
ing session, and, as we have said, merits the approval
of that body. There is no reason why the public
library should not have the same rights of mail fa
cilities for books as are given to publishing houses.
We are an educated people and a nation of readers,
and it is only fair that those who pay taxes for the
support of libraries and of the postoffice should have
the benefits of both to the uttermost extent to which
they can be made available.
BY way of bringing to the attention of capitalists
and , home-seekers the many advantages and
resources of Texas the Governor of that State
has called an industrial convention to meet at Dallas
on the 20th of the present month. The object of the
gathering is to vitalize industry in Texas and con
vince thoughtful investors of the many advantages it
offers for diversified industry. It is stated the con
vention will be attended by upward of two thousand
men of affairs in the State, and will be addressed by
men of national reputation who are in touch with the
progress of the world.
For the purpose of interesting the general public
in the subject and of impressing the value of the con
vention upon all who are seeking business opportu
nities, the invitations to the meeting are accom
panied by a card setting forth some of the advantages
of the commonwealth, as follows: "Raw material of
every description, especially cotton, is produced
cheaper in Texas than anywhere else in the United
States; in short, our natural advantages are second
to those of no other on earth and offer superior in
ducements for the Investment of capital. Of these
facts every dispassionate investigator will be con
vinced. Texas is the nearest cotton field in the
United States to Central and South America and the
Orient. Galveston, its great harbor, occupies as com
manding a position commercially to the republics
bordering on the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea
as does Constantinople to Europe, Asia and Africa,
while we have direct connection by rail with the
gateways of the Pacific Coast."
It is to be borne in mind that this movement in
Texas is in line with similar movements going on
in all the Southern States. Those commonwealths
which for years have been regarded as sluggish and
inert have now set to work in earnest to attract men
and capital from the North. They have already es
tablished a cotton manufacturing industry which
threatens that of New England, and have done also
much in the direction of iron, steel and wood work.
California ought to profit by the lesson that is
being taught in the South. We have, indeed, no cot
ton industry to workup, but we have a large quantity
of raw material that should be manufactured here.
Why should there not be a concerted and resolute
effort to attract to this State the attention of invest
ors? Why learn from Texas?

A LESSON FROM TEXAS.
"SHAMROCK WILL WIN."
So Says an Astrologer.
ASTROLOGICAL COMPARISON OF THE TWO YACHTS
For forty-eight years the sporting circles of Great Britain have been
trying to regain their lost trophy of yachting supremacy.' Fortunes have
been spent and lost In this so far vain effort, and the diplomatic relations
cf the two great Anglo-Saxon nations have been ruffled more than once
over this trifling silver cup, which in itself is not worth one-quarter the
value. of the poorest challenger or defender.
This year our English cousins, with hopeful hearts, send over a yacht
worth an independent fortune, with green paint on its sides, a beautiful
emerald name, and with the Irish pennant flying at Its mlzzen-top. These
tricks will no doubt appeal to the sympathy of the Irish New Yorkers,
where the race will be held, and In case of victory (for the Shamrock),
which teems more probable this year than ever before, and to the Intui
tional almost certain, it will take away part of the chagrin of a purely
English defeat
This article I have offered to the public only after a great many mis
givings, for It is hard for an American by birth, breeding and everything
(even though his business ls that of an astrologer), to write an article
which may appear unpatriotic; and to the betting fraternity I earnestly
hope that they will place no money on my predictions, for astrology is
altogether dependent on the judgment of the interpreter, and an error or
oversight in this respect is at all times possible.
As our graceful and resplendent yacht, the Columbia, the latest valiant
defender of our long-held trophy of victory, slid down the ways at Bristol,
R. 1., the cardinal sign Caprlcornus was on the ascendant, and Its ruler,
the strong, powerful, but unfortunate- planet Saturn, was retrograde in
the twelfth house, the house of grief and secret enemies. He Is also vio
lently opposed by the sun. Mercury and Neptune from the house of naval
forces, and by the ruler of the house of death. These configurations have
to a certain extent already been confirmed by the accidents that have oc
curred to the fleet racer. But Saturn, ruler of the figure, ls happily well
aspected by Mars and the benign planet Jupiter, showing the boat to be
good, powerful and a very* fast sailer. Venus, ruler of the tenth, the house
of honor and success, is also strong and in her own sign, and auspiciously
occupies the fifth house, the ruler of sports, races, etc. Here, therefore, is
a strong element of success, and if beaten it will be by a very small margin.
The Shamrock, the largest, lightest and most graceful rival yacht that
has ever come to American waters, was launched on the Thames at 3:33
p. m., June 2fi, 1599. As her burnished hull first struck water the strong,
fixed and malignant sign Scorpio was ascending, and Its ruler, the war
lord Mars, the planet of fight and push and Irish pluck, shone high In the
heavens and occupied the house of honor and success. Leo had culminated
for the day. and its ruler, the all-powerful sun, is applying to a close
benevolent aspect with Mars; these aspects are certainly auspicious of
success. The Irish boat will prove a very fleet and stanch racer, and Its
ruler, happily free from any malignant Influences, and receiving the kindest
rays from the ruler of the house of honor, presages for it a career of honor
and glory. Jupiter, the lord of the fifth house, the house of sports and
racing, is also In good aspect with the sun. but separates from the evil In
fluence of Saturn. The planets, therefore, are favorable and unfavorable to
a certain extent in each case. Both horoscopes, it will be seen, show ele
ments of strength and speed for their respective boats. There is still a strong
element of doubt left, after carefully considering each map of the sidereal
heavens. The boats are evenly matched, and it will be a very close con
test. The race may bo won by the Shamrock through an accident to the
Columbia, for the cup defender, although a fine boat, is the more unfortu
nate of the two. She will meet with accidents during her whole career,
and probably be totally wrecked or destroyed In the end.â James M. Lang

Angellotti of San Rafael.
At 10 o'clock yesterday morning the
most worshipful Grand Lodge of Free
and Accepted Masons of California met
In annual convocation in the Masonic
I Temple. There were present nearly 500
I representatives who were assembled In
the interests of 267 lodges in this Jurisdic
tion. The following named grand officers
were also present: Master F. M. An

j Grand Organist Samuel D. Mayer and
Grand Tyler George P. Adams of San
I Francisco.
This is the fiftieth annual communica
j tion, the first having been held in the
city of Sacramento on the 7th of May.
! 1850.
Grand Master Judge Angellotti In his j
| annual address, which is an able docu-
I ment, says that there has been during tne '
i year a net increase of over 875 I
I members, something which has been
| exceeded but once in- the history
jof the Grand Lodge In this State.
I Dispensations were granted to organize
West Gate Lodge at Los Angeles, Fruit
vale Lodge at Frultvale, Carquinez
I Lodge at Crockett and San Jacinto Lodge j
lat San Jacinto, while Covlna Lodge, to
j which a charter was granted by the pre
vious Grand Lodge, was regularly con- j
I stituted by Senior Grand Warden James ;
;A. Foshay of Los Angeles. Arcturas I
; Lodge and Petaluma Lodge were consoli- ;
i dated under the name of Petaluma Lodge, j
i and Pilot Hill and Georgetown lodges i
j were consolidated under the name of j
I Georgetown Lodge. No lodge during the i
I year surrendered its charter, and the :
I financial condition is as a rule favorable. '
I Harmony generally exists, and In most I
localities there is apparent a spirit of i
| zeal and enthusiasm that is most grati- 1
I fying.
Only one death occurred in the ranks
| of the past officers of the grand body '
; and none in that of the sitting grand
i officers. The death was that of Theodore
j Guevara Cockrill, who was senior grand
j warden in 1868.
During the year the Grand Lodge laid
. the cornerstone of the college building of
, the Faculties of the College of Physicians
i and Surgeons in San Francisco, of a new
i Methodist Episcopal church in Hod- '
j lands, and by direction of the grand
master the grand senior warden con
! ducted the ceremony of laving the corner
stone of the new City "Hall at Long
Beach.
The grand master enforced the law of
the' order that 'prohibits the work of
lodges being carried on In any language
but that of the ritual of the Grand Lodge,
which is the English language.
The grand treasurer and grand secre
tary presented their reports, which took
the usual course.
It was decided to convene the Grand
Lodge at 9 o'clock this morning and call i
it off at 11 o'clock, and have as many of
the representatives as can go to Decoto
to Inspect the Masonic Home at that ;
place.
To-morrow the officers for the ensuing ]
year will be elected. Last evening Pacific i
Lodge exemplified the work of the third
degree before the Grand Lodge.

CHEESEâ A. S., Middleton. Cal. The
materials employed in making cheese aro
milk and rennet. The milk may be of any
kind, from the poorest skimmed to that
rich in cream, according to the quality of
cheese required. The material being
ready, the greater portion of the milk is
put "into a large tub and the remainder
sufficiently heated to raise the whole
quantity to the temperature of new milk.
The whole is then whisked together and
the rennet added. It is then allowed to
stand until completely â  turned, when the
curd is struck down several times with a
skimming dish, after which it is allowed
to subside. The vat covered witii cheese
cloth is then placed on a horse Or ladder
over the tub and filled with curd by means
of the skimmer. The curd is pressed
down with the hands and more added as
it sinks. This process is repeated until the
curd rises about, two inches above the
edge. The cheese partially- separated
from the whey is placed in a clean tub
and a proper quantity of salt added, after
which a board is placed under and over
it, and pressure applied for two or three
hours. The cheese is then turned out,
new cheese cloth . put around it and
pressed again for ten hours. It requires
practice to make good cheese. There are
books that give all the details.

THREE MILLIONS
MORE FOR FRUIT
IS YEAR'S GAIN
Estimates Made Up
by Two Experts.
â â¢
DRIED PRODUCTS A BONANZA
- â â¢
PRICES ADVANCED AND TRADE
FIELD GREW.
The farmers of California will receive
something: like $15,000,000 this season for
such products of their orchards and vine
yards as are canned or dried. This is
an advance of about $3,500,000 over the
total received last year. D. H. Porter of
Porter Brothers yesterday made an esti
mate of the State's dried fruit output for
The Call at ?5,390,000. Superintendent Fon
tana of the California Fruit. Canners' As
sociation estimated the canned fruit out
put at $6,500,000. The story of the year
as told by these gentlemen makes good
reading for the farmers and for all others
interested In the prosperity of California.
"There has not been an average crop
of peaches," said Mr. Porter, "but prices
have advanced. Dried peaches, for In
stance, are 25 per cent higher than they
were and the Eastern buyer who expected
to get them at his own figures is in the
lurch. At the beginning of the season
j the report was sent out that the peach
j crop would . be very large. The peaches
! will not exceed 1200 to 1300 cars, as
i against an early estimate of 2000 carloads.
The Raisin Association has put up the
price for raisins to almost double the
I figures of last year and yet the goods are
; moved as fast as they are ready. An
. advance has just been made in the prices
lof two grades of raisins. Three crown
! standard loose muscatels have gone up
' one-fourth of. a cent per pound and the
i four crown have- been raised one-half cent
per pound. These prices are netting the
j growers nearly double what they realized
I from the prices last year.
"My estimate Is that the season's out
< put will be 1200 carloads of peaches at
$1200 per car; 1000 carloads of prunes at
$;Â«â  per car; 350 carloads of apricots, for
which $"<'<â  would be a low average; 2500
carloads raisins, averaging $1200 at least;
pears, plums and nectarines and that sort
SUICIDE OF PON HIM,
A WEALTHY MERCHANT
Si â t^ON HIM, a wealthy merchant of
P 1 this city, member of the firm of
[ Shun Yuen Hing, 839 Dupont
is street, committed suicide aev-
eral weeks ago by jumping
overboard from the steamer China
near Yokohama. The n ws reached
the custom-house yesterday through
the agency of a letter received by Dep
uty Customs Collector N. S. Farley.
I Him had been n familiar figure
around the custom-house for the past
i fifteen years or more. He attended
personally to the large importing Inter

their banking business. He was a
j model of commercial honor, and his

some months ago his health began to

this port on the steamer China on
August 25 of this year. When the
steamer was leaving Yokohama Him

of fruit, 150 carloads, averaging $1500 per
car; apples, haps 150 carloads, at $1500
per car.
"The advance over last year's receipts
for dried fruits will be nearly $2,000,000.
This is due in part to the advanced prices
for raisins. Then, again, prune,- are large
and are netting more. The European
market for California goods la widening;
the Atlantic Coast demand Is Increasing;
the Oriental trade and increased con
sumption at home are also factors."
Superintendent Fontana of the Califor
nia Fruit Canners' Association made
these figures as his estimate: "The
canned fruit output will be, approximate
ly, about $Â»5,5<*),000 In value, and about
3.000.0U0 cases in amount. Last year the
pack was worth about 15,000,000 and the
output about 2,500,000 cases. One reason
for the increase is the general prosperity
of the world at large; the other is" the
lack of supplies, the market having been
cleared up, and that gave an opening for
large supplies this year.
BLAMED THE PILOT.
Charged With Responsibility for the
Wreck of the Morgan City.
Postmaster Montague received yester
day a letter from Oscar Schutt. a postal
clerk In the Philippines, in which the
writer gives an account of the wrecking
of the Government transport Morgan
City. Scbutt was a -passenger on the
transport at the time of the wreck. He
writes: "There was no excuse for th"
wreck. The watch called out 'land ahead'
several times. The second officer also
was on the bridge, and he also reminded
the pilot that there was land and for
him to slow down. The pilot thought
that he could turn the ship In time, but
missed the point. The second officer ar
gued with him and said that he would
strike. The second officer rang the gong
and slowed her down a little, thus sav
ing hundreds of lives. If she had struck
running at full speed I am afraid that
few of us would have escaped."
Rudolph Herring Arrives.
Rudolph Herring, the eminent civil en
gineer, who has been employed by the
city to examine, Investigate and approve
â  plan for a sewerage system for San
Francisco, In conjunction with Messrs.
Grunsky, Manson and Tllton, is in this
city, Stopping at the Palace Hotel. He
has just finished work for the city of
Philadelphia of the same character and
has been consulting engineer for most
of the prominent cities of America. Mr.
Herring was entertained at lunch by
Mayor Phelan yesterday. A plan for
drainage will probably be submitted to
the voters on December 23 and the report
of the engineers will doubtless be sub
mitted within ten days.
In the Divorce Court.
Lucy Bear was granted a divorce from
Solomon Bear yesterday on the ground
of desertion. A decree of divorce entered
by Judge Belcher in favor of Nettie Z.
Farrington and against Archibald Far

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
FOR HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
FRED J. CROSS NOW ON HIS WAY
TO CONSULT MARCONI.
A Honolulu Business Man Who In
tends to Utilize the Ital
ian's Genius.
Among those who arrived on the Mari
posa yesterday is Fred J. Cross, a prom
inent business man of Honolulu, who is
on his way East to consult with Marconi
relative to establishing a system of inter-
Island wireless telegraphy in the Ha
waiian group.
Some time ago Mr. Cross received a
letter from Marconi making an appoint
ment for a meeting in New York, to
which city he is now bound In order to
witness the experiments which the won
derful Inventor will make under the
supervision of the Navy Department and
to consult with the brainy Italian regard
ing the establishment of his system for
practical use among the islands.
The instruments tor the experimental
stations on the different islands have al
ready been ordered and will be In Hono
lulu by the end of this month or the first
of November. As soon as Mr. Cross re
turns he will experiment on his own ac
count to ascertain the feasibility of the
idea, as it is his intention to ask for no
subscriptions to the stock of the company
he intends to start until he succeeds in
Â§ roving beyond the poradventure of a
doubt that the venture will be a success.
Mr. Cross will personally arrange with
t Marconi regarding the royalty on the In
struments and the system, and if possible
: will arrange for the Inventor to per
sonally accompany him back to the Ha
: waiian Islands and lend the assistance of
j his genius to the initial experiments.
The Marconi system has now been so
: thoroughly tested In the recent yacht
races that no further demonstration of its
efficiency is needed as far as regards
short distances and the conditions that
pertain on the antic seaboard. As far
as can be foreseen the same success
should obtain among the Hawaiian Is
lands and Mr. Cross may soon have the
satisfaction of knowing that it was his
perception and business foresight, allied
to the inventive genius of the wonderful
Italian, which gave to the Hawaiian Is
lands their first wireless telegraphic ser-
I vice.
PLANS FOR TRAFFIC
ASSOCIATION'S WORK
WASHINGTON SENATORS WILLI
BE INTERVIEWED.
Will Be Asked to Help Secure Pacific
Coast Representation on the
Interstate Commerce
Commission.
The executive committee of the Pacific I
Coast Traffic Association met yesterday j
and appointed a committee, consisting of ;
Frank Brown of the American Steel and
! Wire Company, C. R. Haven of Murphy, !
! Grant & Co. and E. R. Lllienthal of the
Crown Distilling Company, to wait upon j
! the Senators of the State of Washington, I
| both of whom are in the city, to confer j
j with them concerning the best way to se- j
j cure the appointment of a member of the !
; Interstate Commerce Commission to rep- '
resent the Pacific Coast. The committee !
to report the name of an attorney to as- i
i sist in the proceedings before the Inter
state Commissioners in Washington, D. i
C, on the 30th inst. was not ready to re
port, and more time was granted.
The executive committee meets daily,
and will probably meet every day up to
the time for the representatives of the
coast to depart for Washington. Much
that la done is necessarily confidential. ]
The committee members say that there
will be a strong fight and that the coast '
is in good shape to make the fight for its j
! interests. The following is a copy of the
j body of the circular sent out to the whole
salers, manufacturers and jobbers of the
â  coast to get the necessary funds:
: "The suit brought by the Business Men's
League of St. Louis before the Interstate
Commerce Commission against the trans
continental railroads and contributing
lines, demanding that the differentials be
tween carloads and less than carloads be I
i practically done away with; that rates be i
graded from the Atlantic seaboard west
to St. Louis, and that our present Western
terminal system be changed so as to give
all intermediate towns and cities a less j
rate than San Francisco and other ter
minals now have, is a move on the part
of St. Louis, Chicago and other Middle i
West cities, which if successful will re- I
suit in the destruction of the Jobbing bus
iness of the Pacific Coast. The suit is
really brought against you. The whole
salers, jobbers and manufacturers of the |
coast must become parties to the suit and |
defend their rights.
"To do this the Pacific Coast Traffic As- j
sociation has been organized, the member- I
ship of which will consist of all lines in- !
terested in maintaining and defending the i
Eosltlon occupied by the wholesalers, job- i
ers and manufacturers of this coast. j
Your subscription entitles you to mem- j
bership in that association. An attorney
must be employed and an answer filed at
once, as the hearing Is set in the city of !
Washington, D. C, for October 30.
"The committee appointed to receive j
subscriptions will call upon you In the
near future." |
CLEARLY PROVES
HIS INNOCENCE
AND IS RELEASED
Harry McVeay Was
Not the Robber.
â¦
BLUNDERING POLICE METHODS
â¦ â -
AN INNOCENT MAN THROWN IN
THE TANKS.
Harry McVeay, the cook who was un
justly suspected by Detective Crockett
and Sergeant Ellis of being the man who
stole a sack containing $4000 from the
buggy of Captain Barneson, and who
since last Sunday has been locked up In
the "tanks" in the City Prison, was given
his freedom yesterday, as it was conclu
sively shown that he had nothing to do
with the robbery. .-â¢: -'Â».'
The friends of the much abused man
I are now seriously thinking of preferring
J charges of Incompetency against the
I blundering sleuths who dragged McVeay
I from his place of employment and threw
j him In prison without first having ob
; tamed the least evidence against him.
: Yesterday Attorneys Harris and Hess,
! who had been employed by friends of the
j unfortunate man to defend him, visited
j police headquarters, intending to consult
; with him about his arrest. Becoming
; alarmed, Crockett and Ellis immediately
j informed Chief Lees of the presence of
the attorneys and suggested that McVeay
Ibe given his freedom. They both ad
; mitted that they had made a serious
blunder in arresting him.
Learning that the attorneys had applied
to Superior Judge Lawler for a writ of
habeas corpus, intending to secure the re-
I lease of their client. Lees, In order to cir
, cumvent them, sent word to the prison
; keeper to discharge 'McVeay from cus
' tody. McVeay was then ushered out of I
I the prison and told that he was at liberty
,to go where he pleased. The attorneys
1 were much chagrined over the action of
Lees, as they were anxious to show up
' the "Siberian methods" of the local Police
Department in trying to railroad an inno
: cent man to the penitentiary.
The statement of the arresting officers
that McVeay had been seen by a Mrs. ;
Willis entering the Nevada House, where
he roomed, with a sack of coin under his '
coat shortly after the commission of the i
robbery, is untrue. Mrs. Willis unhesitat
ingly declares that the man she saw with
a sack of money secreted under his coat
was Nils Toft, who is employed at the :
! Chutes. On the day of the robbery he j
i was sent to the Mint by his employers
to change some gold and silver into nick
els and dimes. The sack In which he
carried the money was stamped with the
letters V. S. A., and was similar to the
one stolen with In- valuable contents j
from the buggy of Captain Barneson.
Toft rooms at the Nevada House, and ,
after getting the supply of small change
he went to his apartments and placed the
sack and Its contents in a bureau drawer.
Knowing thai McVeay roomed in the
house, the "wise' sleuths concluded that
he was the man who had the sack under
his coat. Yesterday they learned their
mistake, much to their discomfiture.
McVi tells an amusing story of the
particular methods employed by Ellis and
Crockett to force him to make a "con
fession." They first tried to bulldoze him,
but a- he steadfastly proclaimed his in
nocence they resorted to cajolery to In
duce him to "squeal." McVeay has been
' advised by his friends to institute a suit
against Lees, Ellis and Crockett for false
| imprisonment
Jealous of Her Husband.
Mrs. Hannah Herbert, 23 Chesley street,
learned hat her husband bad bought a
parrot for $S and presented It to a girl
who played an organ in a saloon. It
roused her jealousy, and Monday night j
she filled up with whisky and was sent to .
the Receiving Hospital suffering from an
attack of delirium tremens. She works
In a pickle factory and is the mother of
two children. Her husband called at the
hospital yesterday and assured her that
the story of the parrot was false, and !
during the afternoon they went home to- j
gether.
Hotel Baltimore, Van Ness avenue and Geary
street; elegant sunny thret-ityom suite and
oath; also hot and cold salt water baths. â¢
Tried the Gas Route.
An unknown laboring man rented a |
room at 072 Mission street Monday night,
and yesterday morning was discovered
in bed with the gas turned on. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital in the
ambulance, and after the usual res
toratives were applied, the doctors
thought that he would recover. Whether
it was iccident or design will not be |
known till he recovers consciousness.

RAIN QUENCHES RAGING FIRES AROUND TAMALPAIS
Wall of Flame Advancing to De
stroy Corte Madera Extin
guished by a Providential
Downpour.
Jjf7yr> TIMELY downpour of rain has
I \\ extinguished the fierce forest fires
j' â that have raged since Monday
'J U> afternoon around the base of
Mount Tamalpais. " At 9 o'clock
last night the onrush of flame seemed to
threaten the destruction of the towns of
Larkspur and Corte Madera. It seemed
as If nothing could stop the roaring in
ferno that bad mounted the ridge separat
ing them from Mill Valley. New assist
ance rushed to fight the fire.
At 10 o'clock, when hope seemed lost,
when houses had been stripped of their
furnishings and the roadside was littered
with them, the clouds opened and rain
began to patter, slowly at first, faster as
the wind died down from a howling pale
to a gentle breeze. The ruddy glow in the
eky from the mile of fire died down and
'veered to the west, where great black
. storm clouds had gathered. Faster and
faster came the downpour. The previously
-stricken residents hurried back
with their household goods; the sky grew
; black, the fire died down and by mid
; night had been soaked so thoroughly that
.southern Marin County had no fears as
it turned into its bed tor the night, tired
and happy that Its roof was still over
its head.
Nothing short of this providential down
pour could have stayed the progress of
the flames. Checked Monday night and
yesterday in their advance down Corto
Madera Canyon to Mill Valley, they
smoldered awhile in the afternoon only
to burst forth with renewed fierceness
and to wheel with a mighty roar In a
fiery attack from Warners Canyon around
: the eastern slope of Tamalpais on the
rldge that separates the valley from Bal
timore Canyon. At 9 o'clock at night a
-phalanx of leaping flames a mile long and
Tialf a mile wide was sweeping on down
,-t he western side of the rldge toward that
canyon, threatening Corte Madera and
Larkspur. At Corte Madera everything
appeared doomed before the onsweep of
.the flames and people rushed frantically
about In their homes getting together
what portables they could, burying others
in hastily dug holes and deserting their
homes to Join the newly summoned crews
of re-fighters in a last desperate hope
that the onrush of flame might be mlrac
.tiiously stopped.
For those that had nothing to lose from
the conflagration the sight was magnifi
cent beyond all description. For miles
around the countryside was visible in rud
dy relief. Sparks shot upward into the
llaring heavens, descending In showers
into the roaring, crackling, seething fur
nace breath. The wind swept from the
.lorthwest through the gulches and down
the hillsides Into the wall of fire, bending

Members of Golden Gate Park
Dnv.ng Association Classify
Entries for Their Forth-
coming Meeting.
The members of the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association met last night in
their rooms at the Palace Hotel and ar
ranged the programme for their winter
race meeting. This will be held on the
Ingleside track on the 21st Inst. The

tions to entertain their friends. As a
first means to that end the entries are
unusually large and promise well In the
way of sport.
Two novelties will be presented one a
double-team race, for which four entries
have been received, and the other a novel
variety of heat race. In the latter the
horses entered will be divided first into
two heats. First and second horses In
each of these will start in a second heat
to determine possession of first and sec
ond money. The remaining horses will
then race one heat for third money. This
will be an experimental race, and will be
watched with especial interest.
J. C. Ohlandt has already one win in the
Frank O'Kane cup race to his credit, and
will put forth unusual efforts to score a
second victory tor. the valuable cup.

the following members, passed upon their
merits: F. G. O'Kane, li. H. Dunlap, H.

The Olympic Athletic Club Is again a
beneficiary, Henry B. Russ, its treasurer,
being the latest to return bonds held by
him to be canceled. He handed In $3000
worth without consideration.
Hugo D. Keil, a life member, and as

for 150 some days since. Accompanying
it was a note saying he approved of the
work being done by the new board of of

Architect W. D. Shea, a director of the
club, is preparing plans for the new hand

Abuses His Mother.
HFrank Howard, a genuine "tough," llv-
Ing at 569% Minna street, went home early
yesterday morning drunk and chased
his mother out of the house, threatening
10 kill her. He fell and cut his forehead,
and had to be taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Yesterday his father, N. P.
Howard, swore to a complaint In Judge
Graham's court, charging him with
vagrancy, and he was booked on the
charge. He was released from the County
Jail a few days ago, after serving six
months for beating his mother, * 1 ...
lit in rolling waves. There was something
Plutonic In the air. Men and women ran
1 to and fro, blinded by the glare of the
I oncoming fire, gesticulating wildly and
shouting discordantly, lending a demoniac
reality to the infernal ensemble.
When the flames first leaped over the
ridge in the afternoon Roadmaster John
Taker of the narrow gauge line sent twen
ty-five section men to fight them. The
railroaders were reinforced soon after by
another force of twenty-five men hired
by E. H. Pizley of Corte Madera. â¢ All the
male residents of the town and of Lark
spur Joined them in an attempt to back
lire the advance coming faster and faster.
The alarm grew as the gale roared and
I the fire leaped heavenward. Pillars of
| smoke rose high to conceal the blood-red
sun, and clouds of dust were whirled
; through the canyon. The fire was coming
from the southwest right-in the teeth of
! the gale, that was blowing not less than
forty miles an hour. There were only two
campers In Baltimore Canyon, Miss Nellie
Baker and Miss Sylvia Campbell of 347
Minnesota street, this city, and their
I goods were moved at once to Larkspur.
Charles Rice and Charles Burkhardt of
, San Rafael and A. Silva of Corte Madera
volunteered their services and their ex
press wagons, and were soon busy moving
the furniture of the Corte Madera house
holders to Larkspur, where, though the
; flames threatened to reach it, they might
! be safe for a breathing time. Messrs. H.
Metâler and J. Herzog of the Larkspur
! Hotel gave storage to much of the hast
i ily moved furniture, while the remainder
was stacked in piles along the county
i road.
The wind died down a little toward
i dusk, and although it was still blowing to
i the fire the conflagration grew and roared
and advanced, until at dusk it reddened
I the sky until it could be seen as far as
i San Francisco, fifteen miles away. At 9
i o'clock it was reported that nothing could
stop the rush of the fire down Baltimore
; Canyon and that the houses of the follow
! ing were doomed: Attorney E. C. Chap
; man. George Wall. M. Gilllgan, Joseph
i Simms. Charles Wilson, Miss O'Connor,
John O'Connor, Dr. Bliss, Miss Adams,
Walter Peterson, Dr. Card, Peter S.
Conke, William Jackson, A. .F. Sheldon I
and E. H. and H. L. Pixley. At Chap- I
man's the women folk had torn up all the ;
carpets, and placing In them many arti
cles of value they could not very well
carry, burled them In a hastily dug hole i
In the soft loam, to be dv? up again when
the expected fires sweeping toward their
home had been finally extinguished.
On the Coleman-Forbes tract John
Wade, a wealthy land owner, had twenty
five men engaged back-firing In order to
check the advance of the flames to his j
property, near Alto station. Owners of
cattle were driving their herds out on the I
county road out of reach of danger.

Peter the Great and Tommy
Britton Head and Head in
Sensational Race-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 10.â To-day's
card of five races was made notable by
the breaking of one world's record in the
trotting of a fast half-mile over a rather
slow track. It was in the first heat of
the Ashland stake, which was regarded
as a two-horse race between Tommy
Brit ton and Peter the Great. In the first
heat Peter the Great and Tommy Britton
showed the greatest speed ever seen in
a public race when they trotted head and
head the half-mile in 1:014. with the sec
ond quarter In :294. By some it was
considered that bad driving may possibly
have lost the race for the two heavy
favorites. They kept together to the last
eighth, when Tommy Britton drew aw.iv
and won by a length, all out.' with j-vier
the Great as greatly distressed. Tommy
Britton was done for and Bonatella, w.i .
had finished first in the third and fourth
in the first two heats, took the race
rather easily.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.-The Rancho del
Paso and the Fairview were the features
at i Morris Park to-day. In the , former,
which was for two-year-olds, Brigadier,
who ran second in the Futurity, was 'a
hot favorite, Pupil, Montanlc and Waring

THE SAN FRAN CISCO" CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1899.
FLAMES SWEEPING ONWARD TO BALTIMORE CANYON.
From Mill Valley and Corte Madera
Canyon came other reinforcements, men
who had become veteran fire fighters in a
night and a day, and they, too, plunged
Into the seething vortex, and still the
flames rushed on.
And then as if by magic the gale
softened to a breeze, the wind veered
and the rain began. It seemed to drop so
gingerly In spots for a time that those
who had been Inwardly praying for It as
the only salvation were fearful to shout
lest they should be disappointed: but
more than one gave silent evidence of the
faith that was in him by starting, furni
ture-laden, for his recently deserted home.
The promise contained it. the first gentle
patter was confirmed a few minutes later
by a steady dropping and by the incoming
of a stormcldud from the west that pre
saged more. In less than fifteen minutes
the shower was heavy. At 10:30 o'clock it
was still coming down and all danger had
passed, and the most fearsome, toilsome
good start. Waring rushed to the front
and showed the way to the dip with all
the others close up. At this point Brig
adier made his run, and drawing away
without trouble, came on and won under
wraps by three lengths. Pupil took the
place by a neck from Montanic. Leando
took the Fairview, ridden out, from
Tamer and Holland. Tamer was the
favorite, but was poorly handled by
Dangman. Results:
six and a half furlongsâ Walt Not won.

Track fast. jC
day In the history of the southern part of
Marin County had passed with It.
The passage of the fire that started
Monday on the Rosenqulst property near
the water tanks, spreading east and
south, was easily traceable yesterday
morning. Down Corte Madera Canyon,
south and east into Blithedale and War
ner canyons, and easterly over the Cas
cade ride toward Larkspur, its path was
marked by blazing tree stumps and un
derbrush reduced to ashes. It swept into
the beautiful Japanese garden of George
Marsh, and besides destroying the "Owls'
Nest" and the roundhouse consumed a
large area of vaulable plant growth. In
cluding ail acre of the finest Woodwardla
ferns ever grown in the State. Southerly
in Corte Madera Canyon, almost to the
grounds of the Hotel Eastland, on both
sides of the railroad track, the under
growth was nothing but hot ashes and
smoldering embers. In Warner's (or

a stop of three hours in this city they
will resume their Journey homeward over

night.

MIDITY LED
FROM START
TO FINISH
Bit of Fashion a Disappoint-
ment â Montallade First
at 50 to J.
It looked as If five straight favorites
might tramp down the line at Oakland
track yesterday, but it would seem that
nothing Is a certainty in racing. In the
second paragraph of the afternoon's sport
Bit of Fashion, a choice morsel of horse
flesh picked up by Burns & Waterhouse
In St. Louis, and considered one of the
select of the stable, started for the first
time. On looks alone she should have
been installed favorite, and the daughter
of Forest had the call over Mldlty at post
time. Sunello and The Buffoon were the
only, other contenders. â¢ Mldlty, piloted by
Ruiz, broke away In the lead and was
never headed, winning cleverly In slow
time for the Futurity course. Bit of Fash
lon seemed not ready for a bruising race,
finishing last. Sunello, at odds of 25 to 1,
after being Interfered with by The Buf
foon, displayed a sharp turn of speed,
taking the place In Impressive fashion.
In the concluding race of the day Mon
tallade, a 50 to 1 shot, also broke the slate,
first choices capturing the other three
purses. Montallade had Johnson in the
saddle, and nobody gave the sprinter a
thought, his odds drifting from 12 to 40
and 50. Young Johnson trailed Chihua
hua and Mike Rice into the stretch, and
then getting through an opening won gal
loping by three lengths from the. 6 to 5
choice Chihuahua. Lavator led Mike
Rice, second choice in the betting, out for
the show.
Midlove was held at prohibitive odds In
the books to win the opening event at six
furlongs. . After cutting out the pace from
the jump she. beat Faversham a couple of
lengths. Anchored ran third.
Once more Pat Morrlssey ran circles
around his field in the six and a half fur
long run. Backed to Ito 3 he was always
in front, and Yule, finishing second, was
unable- to make him gallop. Loving Cup,
the second choice, under poor guidance
was fourth.
The only real close finish of the day oc
curred at the termination of the mile and
a sixteenth selling afair.. Opponent ruled
favorite in the betting and was fortunate,
for Reolia was plainly the best. Kept
back until the sun had set, Mounee on the
latter came with a terrific rush, falling
short by a scant head. Another Jump and
the decision would have been' reversed.
Marplot, heavily played at remunerative
odds, ran a good third.

BOXERS ARE
READY FOR
THE ARENA
Heavyweights Russell and
Van Buskirk to Meet To-
Morrow Night-
The winter season of boxing will be In
augurated by the National Athletic Club
at Woodward's Pavilion to-morrow night.
An attractive card has been prepared, the
principal bout being between the only
brace of heavy-weights on the coast. As
boxers are always supposed to attract
spectators in keeping with their weight
these men should have a mighty house.-
Russell will enter the ring weighing
about 210 pounds, while Van Buskirk will
scale over 200. This will be Russell's first
appearance on this coast, and he should
be thoroughly tried out by Van Buskirk.
The latter is a seasoned boxer, having
met among others Stelzner, Kennedy and
Jeffries, lt was only to the superior abil
ity of the present champion that he struck
his colors.
Russell placed himself in the hands of
the veteran, Alex Greggains, some weeks
ago and has proved an apt pupil. They
have boxed together every afternoon, and
Russell has shown marked aptitude for
the game, and his mentor expects him to
make a good showing. He Is strong, fast
and willing, and if he wins to-morrow
night he will have a promising future as
a boxer.
Van Buskirk has not been idle and is
pronounced fit for any kind of a bout.
He did a lot of preparatory work at his
home in Marysville, and then put the
finishing touches on at the Seal Rock
House on the ocean beach. From all in
dications the bout should be a merry one
while it lasts. It is not expected to go
the limit when two such willing boxers
face one another.
What the big fellows will lack In agility
and quickness should be supplied by
"Rufe" Turner and "Jimmy. Reillv.
This will be Turner's first appearance
here, while Reiily is an old favorite. Both
are clever lightweights.
"Billy" Jordan, the veteran master of
ceremonies, will referee both bouts. These"
will be the first important ones he has
passed upon In some time, but he has
kept well in 'practice deciding minor
matches. The seating at Woodward's Pa
vilion has been rearranged with the idea
of giving a better view of the ring.

BALTIMORE. Oct. 10.-Darkness came down
on the Baltimore and Washington teams to-day
after plx. Innings had been played, : with the
fleeted In the heavens. Men on horse
back, in buggies and wagons and all
sorts of rigs fairly flew to the rescue of
their threatened redwoods and all through
the night worked like demons to avert
disaster. : _~ . ;v ...
When the morning broke the fires
seemed to be under control. The fire
fighters, black from smoke, hollow eyed
from the lack of sleep and from the glare
of the flames, presented a sorry-looking
sight in the light of dawn. They were
most of them ready to drop in their
tracks from the night's exertions had it
not been that they were still stimulated
with excitement and fearful that the ris
ing winds might still fan the smoldering
embers into other columns of flame.
They told off watches in all the canyons
and deeply wooded hillsides and, in
squads sought breakfast and a few hours
sleep before noon.
It was well they did. Their fears of
the wind were well founded. At 1 o'clock
lt had assumed the proportions of a good,
stiff breeze, and by 2 o'clock it was
whistling through the canyons, carrying
clouds of oust and smoke in its embrace.
Again the underbrush began to crackle
and snap, smoke rose in threatening
spirals into the atmosphere, still hazy
from the smoke of the night before.
Deer, frightened from their coverts, ran
aimlessly through the redwoods and up
and down the country roads, birds twit
tered in affright, rabbits and wood rats
and quail skurried in one heedless, panic
stricken throng anywhere and every
where from the fire demon.
Fires smoldering in the ashes under the
I redwoods were tanned into flame, charred
stumps blazed anew and a thin trail of
lire forked both ways in the porthern part
of Corte Madera Canyon and in Warners
Canyon. Mounted men hastened to the
threatened forests. D. H. Bibb, the lum
ber man, who has a large residence under
the eastern brow of Tamalpais, put a
large torce of men to work to head off
the advance of the new-blown fire over
the ridge into Baltimore Canyon. His
own residence was in no danger. His men
worked heroically setting backfires, but
the wind was against them and the flames
mounted the ridge to threaten Larkspur
and Corte Madera, leaving the lower
Corte Madera Canyon and Mill Valley in
temporary safety.
Over in Warners Canyon and near
Blythedale the gale had fanned the flames
on" their second errand of destruction, and
it was not long before riders raced into
Mill Valley with the news that the resi
dences of Dr. Alexander Warner and
Hugh Boyle had been consumed. These
rumors were found later to be untrue. The
flames, attaining great volume, had swept
into the canyon as on the night before
and before they were checked had com
pletely destroyed the growth of trees and
vines on Warner's place. By the time
the rain fell there the danger point ap
peared to have been passed, but the down
pour was none the less welcome.
And now that the greatest forest fire
in the history of Marin County has passed
into history, the residents of the valleys
and canyons are thanking their stars and
the rain that lt was not worse. Although
many lives were endangered none were
lost, Lorenzo Ferrari, who was supposed
to have perished in the flames, having ap
peared in the flesh bright and early yes
terday to fight the flames. Much personal
property was damaged, how much is not
known, but its value will run up close to
$100,000, but this is hardly regretted as
much as the destruction of trees on the
ridge and in Warners Canyon. That loss
can only be repaired by time.

PDPoslte Palace Hotel, S. F,LEADERSHIP OF
HORACE DAVIS
IS WELCOMED
Republicans Lining
Up for Victory.
CONTEST ON PARTY LINES
WORKINGMEN READY TO UF- j
HOLD THE CANDIDATE.
Republicans throughout the State of
California nrc taking deep interest In the
San Francisco campaign; ' and Horace
Davis- is hourly receiving messages of
congratulation upon his nomination for
Mayor. Many leading Republicans of th_
city who gave their support to Mayor
Phelan last November are now coming
forward to express their gratification over
the selection of Horace Davis to lead the
party in the municipal campaign.
The leadership of Mr. Davis is espe
cially gratifying to the workingmen of the
city. The sacrifice which he made to the
cause of white labor during the agitation
against the Introduction of Mongolian
competition in the fields of local industry
are well known to the laboring men of
San Francisco. Many voters who are not
Republicans in a strict party sense will
cast the weight of their political influence
in behalf of Mr. Davis' candidacy, It Is
recognized that his success in life has
been accomplished by his own toil and
industry, and lt is further recognised that
lie was a champion of the workingmen
when the cause of honest labor demanded
a fearless and capable leader.
The merchants of San Francisco are
hourly extending to Mr. Davis assurances
of their most earnest support. Men, for
example, like Louis Sloss and Levi
Strauss, who have no word of censure
for Mayor Phelan, recognize that the
election of Horace Davis would reflect
the highest' credit on San Francisco. The
claim put forward by Democratic office
seekers that Democrats deserve the chief
credit for the enactment of the primary
election law and the adoption of the new
char.' is treated with tlie mild derision
that the boast deserves. Taxpayers and
voters generally are again advised of the
fact that the primary election law was
framed by a Republican, introduced in
the Legislature by a Republican, enacted
into law by a Republican Legislature and
approved by a Republican Governor. The
charter was framed by non-partisan
freeholders, received its highest major! -
ties in Republican precincts and was rati
fied by a Republican Legislature.
The Republicans are organizing for vic
tory in tlie comsng municipal election.
They appeal for success to the virtue, lii
telligence and civic patriotism of San
Francisco. The campaign : - to be con
ducted vigorously and fearlessly. They
accept Mayor Phelan's challenge for
a contest on party lines. The Mayor, in
( pening the campaign for the Democrats
..t Metropolitan Hall on August 4, de
clared:
"We all have to be party men now. We
have to cany out reforms within the
party. We- all have to be party politi
cians; we can't be independents and go
before the people and say we will do thus
nnd so. We have to get behind the party
and make lt the Instrument and the
agency of our work."
The Call insists that the Mayor shall
abide by his expressed conditions of the
contest. Let him go to the Democrats
that he and his Committee of One Hun
dred excluded from the State convention
which nominated James G. Maguire and
ask for their support as a straight out
party man. It is time, however, that he
should cease his prowling around Repub
lican premises, seeking political favors
under false colors.
The Republicans will open the campaign
â with a bier mass meeting one evening this
week. Eloquent and earnest speakers will
address the taxpayers.
The Horace Davis Central Club has es
tablish^.- "headquarters at 7-3 Market
street, and advocates of the cause of
good municipal government under Repub
lican auspiet s will lie welcomed. John W.
Taylor, a stalwart Republican, is secre
tary of the club. This organization is
separate from the Republican County
Committee, but as the quarters are spa
cious the regular committee of the party
may find accommodation there.

POSTUM CEREAL.
INSANE MAJOR.
Change of Food Cured Him.
What a determined and Intelligent
wife can accomplish is well shown in "
the experience of a certain retired ma- 1
jor of the Civil War, and his estimable j
wife. For obvious reasons the name
and exact address of the major is with-
held, but the facts are given by his
cousin, a well-known lady of Marlon,
Ohio.
Without apparent cause, but coming
on gradually, the major lost his mind,
and some of the most eminent special- !
ists In brain and nervous disease*
stated that he would never recover,
strongly recommending the wife to j
place him in an asylum, although con- â¢
fident he would live only a few months. |
Being a woman of much strength of ;
character, she refused to Incarcerate !
him, but on the contrary took him to ]
.a cottage along the shores of a little j
lake for the summer and devoted her- |
self entirely to the case, studied him I
carefully and especially applied herselr i
to the preparation of food and drink, i
gradually eliminating what was harm-
ful and substituting nutritious and j
properly selected articles, with the
startling result that in about six
months he was an absolutely sane man,
and in a year was healthier than he
had ever been in his life.
She recites that the chief agency in I
his return to health was Postum Cereal
Food for from the moment she
began using that .article in place of
coffee he Improved in a marked degree.
At one time she left, off Postum and
alloy him to use ordinary coffee, and
he .had a quick and serious backset.
Returning to Postum he improved; no.w 1
they- use nothing else and fire most en- !
thUsiastic in their faith In Its health- j
giving qualities, and naturally make j
many. converts among their friends. j
The. .relater adds: "At first we :
thought Postum was fiat and tasteless,
but after following the directions ex-
actly and boiling it twenty minutes we
secured a richness equal to the best
Mocha and Java, and enjoy it greatly.
[ have lost that heavy, depressed feet-
ing, that obtain* formerly, and. my
children are growing fat' on" Postum." ;
The . lady requests that her name be 'Â
omitted from publication. The nam*,
however, will be given by letter upon
application to the Postum Cereal Co., ,
Ltd.. at Battle Creek, Mich. [.
WILL FIGHT FOR
A BIG FORTUNE
IN ROYALTIES
Benson Bidwell's War
on Infringers.
VAST CLAIMS UPON PATENTS
â¦â
NO TROLLEY CAB COULD BE USED
WITHOUT HIS INVENTIONS.
BhNSOM BIDWELL, INVENTOR.
A bill of complaint will soon be filed in
'lie United States Circuit Court here as
the commencement of one of the most
important suits ever tried in any court.
Benson Bldwell. who claims to be the
original Inventor of the system by which
all the electric roads of the country are
operated, is the principal complainant.
The Market-street Railroad Company of
this city, the Thomson-Houston Elec
tric Company of Connecticut and the
General Electric Company of New York
are made defendants,- and similar suits
will be commenced in several States. Bid- j
well charges that the' defendant corpora
tions, as well as others, have made im
mense profits out of his inventions, and i
the suits in question are based upon in
fringement of. his patents. He asks for a j
royalty of 40 per cent on the net profits.
The bill of complaint Is quite volum
inous, but In substance the suit involves j
the validity of the patents by which all
the electric railways in the country are
operated; It is claimed that Benson Bid J
well actually invented and obtained
patents covering the present system of }
electric roads, and that his patents are
now being infringed here and elsewhere. '
It is claimed that the local company is
operating under a license obtained from !
the other companies made defendants in
the suit. â¢
I In brief, the bill of complaint sets forth
i that prior to the 14th of August, 1884
| Benson Hidweli Invented a system for the
! operation of electric railways by which
i the electro-motors of the cars an pro
pelled, anjj-the lamps located In the cars
1 are lighted, by the us of a single current
i of electricity transmitted from a power
: station along the line; that he was the
i original Inventor of the same. On that
j date he applied for a patent covering
this system, which was duly allowed and
granted on May 26, 1885. On February 16
ISS4. he applied for letters patent cover
ing another feature*of the Bystem which
consisted of a metallic line circuit com
posed of tubular conductors, combined
with a movable brush. This invention
was patented September 23, 1884
On August 14, 1884, Bldwell filed another
application for letters patent covering
other features of his system, including a,
generator it the side of the line, metallic
line conductors separate from the railÂ«
traveling current collectors attached to
the car. a polarizing switch by which the
car is reversed, circuit wires by which
the ends of the line conductors are con
nected with the feed wires, supports for
line conductors along the way; means of
switching line conductors, and a system
of gearing direct from the car motor to
the axle of the car.
It is claimed that the iwo patents
actually obtained, and the application
above referred to, cover practically all
the features of the electric railway
system as now operated here and else
where.
Bldwell has demanded royalties and
damages and has commenced suits
against them in other States also, but by
reason of 111 health and lack of funds has
not been able hitherto to prosecute a
hna hearing. He claims that these com
panies have entered Into an alliance to
deprive him of the benefit of his inven
tions; that they have organised a great,
trust which sells to various companies
throughout the country the right to uÂ«=e
and operate electric roads, and covenants
to protect and defend their licenses from
all claims by reason of Bidwell's patents i
It Is alleged that the Market-street Rail
way Company, the principal defendant In
the pending suit, is operating under such
a contract. The purpose of the trust it
Is claimed, is to establish a monopoly and !
discourage and prevent individual effort.
Not a car, it is claimed, could be oper
ated without the use of Bidwell's patents.
He asks the court to decree that he was
the original Inventor of the system of
propelling, lighting and heating cars by
electricity, setting forth his claims li de~
tall; that It l- decreed the Market
street Railway Company and other de
fendants are infringing upon his rights
and that an account be taken of their
profits and the complainant awarded
damages accordingly.
HOSPITAL TROUBLES
BROUGHT TO AN END
AUDITOR WELLS LAYS DOWN A
SATISFACTORY PLAN.
Will Audit Claims in a Way That
Will Leave No Deficit Next
January.
If the Finance and Hospital commit
tees of the Board of Supervisors hud con
sulted Auditor Wells when the shortage
in hospital funds developed they would
have saved themselves several days of
worry and figuring. The Auditor "opened
up shop" yesterday morning by an an
nouncement that he would not abide by
the relief resolution adopted by the Su
pervisors on Monday, and a half dozen
county contractors were soon on hand
With further threats to shut off all sup
plies/ : [':;.'.; 'â â â 
Dr. Hodghead and Chairman Attrldge
were at once Informed of the Auditor's
decision and Immediately sought a con
ference with him at his office. He in
formed them he would audit no claims
drawn on either the statutory salaries or
urgent necessity funds, but would ar
range the matter by auditing all claims
against the hospital fund up to Septem
ber IS. on an appropriation of $113,000 per
year. and all claims contracted thereafter
on an appropriation of 190,000. In that
way the hospital would be only a hun
dred or so dollars behind and the result
would be achieve.', that was contemplated
in the resolution adopted by the Super
visors.
Auditor Wells said he had every right
to figure the appropriation up to Septem
ber IS at $113,000 per year, as that was
the figure set In the provisional tax levy.
The $90,000 appropriation was not fixed un
til the permanent levy went Into effect,
Auditor Wells' decision finally, disposes of
the hospital's troubles, and so satisfac
torily that there will be no deficit to face
at the end of th" fiscal year.
Republican Ratification.

Thirty-second Assembly District Repub-
lican League was held last night at 1110

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 11. 1899.
REPORTER SNOW
WAS DROWNED IN
THE BAY WATERS
Washed Off a Launch
by a Wave.
â â¦â¢ â
MET DEATH DOING HIS DUTY
â ' â â
ASSOCIATES TRIED IN VAIN TO
SAVE HIM.
Will A, Snow, marine reporter of the
Chronicle, was drowned about S o'clock
last night while in the pursuit of his duty
as a reporter. He went out on the launch
Sybil with Reporter Archie Rice and
Artist Johnson of the Chronicle to get
the news from the incoming transport
Tartar, which brought Into port the
Kansas volunteers. The launch went
: alongside of the transport in the stream
as she was coming in and threw out a
; line to the transport. . Snow was a Kansas
man. He was a classmate and close
â¢ friend of General Funston and was per
; sonally acquainted with many of the
. Kansas volunteers, and a lively conver
! sation began between the transport and
i the launch.
While Snow was shouting to Steele, cor
respondent of the Kansas City Star, a
, heavy wave struck the launch, the water
being very rough, and Snow was thrown
; to the deck. Captain Frank Peters of the
j launch saw the mishap and shouted to
; Snow to go aft. Snow remained where he
i was and held on to the side rail. Th"
, transport- and the launch were grlndins
i together on the high sea. Another wave
I struck the launch. Then it is supposed

that Snow went overboard. No one saw
him as he struck the water. Indeed, he
was at first mistaken for a floating pack
! age which Steele was to have cast over
the side of the transport. As soon as he
was missedâ and he was then perhaps
forty feet astern. Archie Rice snouted for
the soldiers on the transport to throw out
a life-preserver, which they did. There
were no life-preservers on the launch nor
anything that could be thrown out to help
', save life.
The line that held the launch to the
transport was not cast off Immediately.
i The si. ldlers did not understand what had
happened. Two 'attempts were made to
pull the launch clear. Finally Captain
Peters yanked the line from the bin. All
the time Snow was drifting away on a
swift ebb tide. As soon as the launch
was clear she backed. Snow was then
shouting in a panicky way. He was told
I to keep still to save his, strength, that the
! launch would save him as soon as it COUld
Ibe turned. After the launch was under

Will A. Snow was a graduate of the
University of Kansas, of which his
father, one of the most prominent ento
mologists living, is the president. He
came to California about a year and a
half ago, having been called to Stanford
University as an instructor in ento
mology. He was a success as an in
structor, and several Eastern universi
ties invited him to instruct for them. He
refused, simply because he had a taste
for newspaper life and was fascinated
with it. Stanford lured him back for a
term. Then he returned to newspaper
work. He became marine reporter for
the Chronicle three months. ago. His en
thusiasm was unbounded. When the
transport Sherman came into port he
learned that there were reporters for
The Call aboard and he was shut out. He
ran alongside of the ship and risked his
life to make a flying leap for the ship's
ladder. He was ordered to get off the
ladder by the ship's officers, but would
not relax his hold until an officer went
down the ladder and stamped on his
Angers, crushing them nearly to pulp.
On another occasion he saved a rival
newspaper man from drowning by pulling
him out Of the bay which finally encom
passed his death. He was a courteous
gentleman, a good friend, a chivalric
newspaper man. His age was 29. He
was a member of the Phi Kappa Pal fra
ternity. His home was in Lawrence,
Kans. __

Dried Fruit in New York.
Mall advices from New York say: "All
brokers and jobbers report an increasing trade
and an upward tendency to prices. The condi
tions under which -opperators are now work
ing are much more favorable than previously,
nnd there are plenty of indications that trade
ls going to improve continuously from now out,
It has been a long wait, but the present out
look promises all the activity dealers antici
pated.
"Prunes are firmer, and, according to rumors
floating about yesterday, there will be large
pales soon, because negotiations for 15 to 20. or
even larger lots, are in progress and will no
doubt be consummated speedily 'i he general
conditions governing the trade are unchanged,
except that firmness has increased md here
is more liberal buying by small purchasers.
The scarcity of 90s makes sales of the four
pizes difficult. Nineties command a premium
of '/Jc. and are sold on that basis. Few lots
are sold for less or more than ?. -. f. a b., In
bags and prices ten! upward rather than down
ward on all sizes.
"Few Important sales of new raisins are In
progress. The price scares some buyers and
the repeated assertions that foreign goods ot
the same quality can be laid down here cheaper
than the cost of loose Muscatels laid down
In this morket has a tendency to weaken the
buying and make probable purchasers of con
siderable quantities hold off until the actual
outcome of present conditions is known. Even
tually consumers will have to have raisins, but
nt present they can worry holders by not
taking them.
"Peaches continue steady at the recent ad
vance, with an upward tendency noted In most
lines. It ls said that Chinese peaches are sell
ing better, and that some grades are already
scarce. Holders feel more confidence and are
Insisting upon better prices or no' -.-lies.
"Apricots continue firm, but the market is
quiet ar.d prices are showing an upward ten
dency when any change is Indicated. The sup
ply ls not excessive, because canners paid more
money than driers could afford and conse
quently left the evaporators with only small
supplies to draw from.
"Pears are likely to be scarce, and prices
will rule high. The crap In California was
Hhort and as the bulk of dried pears come from
there the outcome Is obvious."

EASTERN MARKETS .
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The stock market to
day demonstrated in a striking manner its reli
i ance on the domestic money situation and Its
i indifference to the events in foreign lands. The
j London market advanced prices under the lead
| of Kaffir mining stocks. In which there is a
I merry speculation, bated on the assumption of
| early control by the British Government if the
Hand mining district. The local market re
sponded only partly to the improved quotations
from abroad, and more than lost the opening
gainst before the end of the flrst hour. Then
came the announcement from Washington of
the decision of the Treasury Department to
anticipate the November interest on Govern
ment bonds without discount and that of the
entire fiscal ear at discount of two-tenths of
1 per cent, about the regular rate on Govern
ment bonds. The response was prompt ana em
phatic, prices rising with more appearance of
strength than for a long time past. The gains
ranged from l to over 2 per cent in many active
stocks. The buying was undoubtedly in large
part due to the covering of short contracts by
the bear interest, which has been considerably
extended during the last few days on the con
tinuing appearance of money stringency. The
speculative industrials were most affected, in
cluding those in -the metal Industry. The most
notable movement in the railroad list was that
of Burlington, which rose an extreme -'Â. When
the demand for the short Interest was satisfied
prices began to sag again, and with the ex
ception of sharp bidding up of sugar to the top
Wei In the late dealings the close was In
clined to heaviness. The action of the Treas
ury Department on its face offers something
like went, six millions for the relief of tlie
money market and over $4,300,000 of this with
out discount. The amount provided for imme
diate release, however, is only about $1,500,.00,
t;ie payment of the balance of November 1 in
terest being fixed for weekly periods up to
October 23. The extent to which this privilege
will be availed of Is a problem, but last year's
experiment on the same lines did not bring
striking suits: The anticipated interest last
year was that due on October 1 and November
1, i- ' that this year's offer is greater by more
than $22.000.1.100 so far as interest ls concerned,
but last year the Government anticipated a
redemption of $14,000,000 nf Pacific Railroad
bonds in September and increased its deposits
with the depository' hanks 1.;. $23,000,000 in Sep
tember and October. The treasury was paying
out money freely then, while this year the Gov
ernment surplus is constantly taking mom out
of the market. On the whole the relief offered
by the Government to the money market ap
pears rather meager by contrast with last year,
lien the rate for call loan was at no time
over 6 per cent during the crop-moving peril
The call loan rate worked rather easier to-day,
though the majority of loans were made at 10
per tent maximum rate. In time loans lenders
were more willing to give accommodations for
short periods, whereas they had been holding
out for the six months' period. The rate for
ull periods continues at 6 per cent. The money
situation abroad was again distinctly easier
and the weekly statement of the Imperial Bank
of Germany, as well as the continued receipt
of gold on balance by the Bank of England in
dicated progress toward recuperation. Never
theless, sterling exchange held firm and German
exchange advanced a fraction.
The bond market continued dull and changes
in prices were mixed. Total sales, par value
$2. 035.00 c. United States new fours declined _
in the bid price.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The announcement which was made during
the day's session of the Stock Exchange here j
that the Boers had presented an ultimatum, \
which it was reported demanded the with- |
drawal of British troops from the Transvaal |
borders within forty-eight hours, was received
contemptuously generally by financiers and i
especially In view of the persistent rumors of
the purchase from Portugal of Delagoa Bay.
The markets were Inactive, but stronger on
bear coverings and the knowledge that buying '
orders are awaiting an outbreak of hostilities, i
Consols touched 104. In the American depart- I
ment the opening-was steady. Later there was
; a general sagging till near the close, when a j
short spurt occurred, led by Louisville and I
Nashville. In the street also prices rose, i
though there, as on the board, business was
small. Tintns were 45%. the price going up j
on bear closing of contracts.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 10.â A decline of %c marked I
the opening In wheat. Even at their conces- j
sion there was little demand and under liqui
dation by longs, mostly of a. local nature, a !
still further recession In prices took place. I
Liverpool was slightly lower at the start, but |
developed radical weakness before the close
of the session there. It reflected the views of 1
traders in regard to war prospects in the
Transvaal, which were evidently considered
much more remote, and this fact had a strong
Influence on local trading. An equally im
portant factor was the prospects of a heavy
Increase In the visible supply. The increase
was finally announced at 2,803,000 bushels.
Lccal stocks showed an increase of 582,000
bushels. Another source of weakness was the
enormous primary receipts, 2,461,000 bushels.
compared with 2,015,000 bushels a year ago.
The opening price for December was 7-K072%C
against Saturday's closing of 72%Â®72%c. The
price worked down to 72% c, where a little cov
ering by shorts caused a period of steadiness.
The demand was limited, however, and when â¢
satisfied the market again slowly declined, '
keeping on the downward course until well In !
the afternoon. The trading was narrow. The ]
forthcoming crop report had a restraining in
fluence and the absence of d.mand was but
another factor in the weakness. The price was j
almost continually under puts and not until
near the close was any indication of. a rally
apparent. The December price in the mean
time got down to 71%071%C A break of almost
1 cent was too tempting for shorts, who cov
ered quite freely toward the close and caused
an advance to 72%Â©72% c, where the market
closed. A report from New York that sixty
loads had been engaged for export had some
Influence in causing the late rally.
Corn during the morning was active and
strong. Elevator people and commission j
houses were sharp competitors for all offerings. |
Later the feeling became easier on predictions
of general rains and part of the advance was
li it. December closed VsÂ®%c higher at 30% c. j
The market for oats was very dull and prices |
kept within a narrow range. December closed
a shade higher at 22% c.
Provisions were dull and ruled at Irregular
declines. January pork close,] 71,0 lower at !
$3 67%: January lard a shade lower, and Janu
ary ribs 2' â â â¢ lower.

tons, against 162,100.
WHEATâ Everything conspired to depress
the market yesterday. Cables were lower all '
around, both lrom Liverpool and Paris, the
visible supply increased over 2,000,000 bushels,
Russian shipments were heavy, and the de- i
ma nd was light and chiefly for May. The bears j
seized their advantage and hammered the mar

ESTABLISHED IN CAMP.
Triumphant March of the
Washington Men From the
Transport to Presidio.
The Washington men got safely Into
camp just before noon yesterday, and
despite :he cold wind that spread the
dust over everything, they made them
selves comfortable before night. A
breakfast at the ferry depot was the
first sign cf hospitality that awaited the
men from over the sea. As soon as the
transport docked the soldiers came
ashore and stacked arms on the wharf.
and then they were taken up to the ferry
depot, where the breakfast was waiting.
There was enough and some to spare,
even for hungry men from the ocean, and
while the men ate, the reeeution com
mittee, talked, and everything went
smoothly and merrily.
Governor Rogers of Washington had
not much to say. but what he said was to
the point. He said the breakfast was but
an earnest of what was to come when
they reached home. Colonel Wholly
responded on behalf of the regiment, and
then Levi Arkeny. a capitalist of Wash
ington, who was responsible In a great
measure for the breakfast, and who is
the man who will provide the special
train to take the men home, said just a
word or two to the men at table.
It was a good half hour before the men
were satisfied, and then they marched
back to the dock, unstacked their arms,
and turning in behind the escort from the
Third Artillery, which was waiting to
take them to the Presidio, they irfarted
campward. All along the streets the re
ception was as enthusiastic and as spon
taneous .is If there had never before been
a regiment of returning volunteers pass
ing up Market street. Governor Rogers
was well up toward the head of the
column, and he shared the applause that
greeted the men. When the regiment ar
rived a. the Presidio a delegation from
the Montana Regiment was on hand to
invite officers and men to join the Mon
tana men at dinner, an invitation that
was accepted with alacrity.
The Washingtoniar.s will be given the
usual liberty. It will take them the same
old three weeks to get out of the service,
but the rime will not be long, and under
the additional ration provided by the
Government it will but give the men time
to get into condition for the excitement
of the home reception. There has already
been reports of dissensions among the
officers of the regiment, and talk of ail
kinds of charges against Co'onel .Wholly
ls being heard. Whatever may be the at
titude of the officers, there is no doubt hut
that the commanding officer has the con
fidence of the men. To the allegations
of cowardice hinted at they say that
more than once he has proved himself a
braver man than those who are doing the
talking; and as to his competence, the
men refer to the record of the regiment
and. to the few if any mistakes it has
made. They say the talk ls âdue to
jealousy among the officers, and the
charges are based upon the distortion
of little happenings during the campaign.
The volunteer signal corps was mus
tered out yesterday, each man receiving
nearly $200 from the paymaster.
A diagnosis of the suspected cases of
smallpox at the camp of the Thirty-first
Regiment on Angel Island has resulted
In a decision that one is smallpox and the
other is varioloid. They were both
patients under detention, however, so
they will delay the regiment no longer
than October 14. On that day the men
will be released from quarantine unless
other cases develop.
Hvram Spellman, a private of the
Idaho Regiment, left behind in the hos
pital suffering from consumption, died
yesterday.
Major Samuel D. Sturgls, assistant
adjutant general, has been assigned to
temporary duty at department head
quarters.
First Lieutenant John W. Barker,
Third Infantry, has been assigned to
temporary duty with the recruits at the
Presidio.

Gallant Record of the Wash
ing Volunteers in the
Philippines.
The home-coming volunteers are all, as
they should be. alike dear and deserving
in the eyes of the people of San Fran
cisco: but if any distinctions could be
made, after her own brave soldier boys,
who have already had their "'welcome
home," first would very properly and
justly come the gallant fellows from the
State of Washington. They were the first
of the outside volunteers to enter our
gates and take their place in Uncle Sam's
service along side the California boys.
who preceded them but a few days. They
are the sons of our neighbor and sister
Pacific State, to whom many personal ties
of kinship and social and business con
nection bind us more closel^ and Inti
mately than most of the others. And
again, they were in more than name
brothers In arms of our First California
boys. They were brigaded with them,
and when the trial of battle came fought
and fell side by side with them.
All these things and others incident to
her contact with them make for the
Washington boys a place very near the
warm heart of San Francisco.
The advance of the Washingtons, under

under Colonel Wholly and Major Cary.
on the 22d. They sailed from here in the
same order in October. On arriving at
Manila they were quartered on the south
side of the Pasig, ami later assigned with
the First California, the First Idaho and
the First Wyoming to General King's
brigade of Major General Anderson's divi
sion, which held the American line, from
the Pasig River near Pendacan down
along the Estero Concordia and the Trlpa
de Gaiiir.a. westward to Malate, on the
bay. King's brigade covered the eastern
portion of this line, winding from the river
along the streams mentioned to the vicin
ity of blockhouse 12, a little to the south
east of Pace. This threw them face to
face with General Mascarti- division of
the Filipino my, comprising some of the
best troops in their whole muster.
For some weeks preceding the Filipino
outbreak it had been expected, and whea
it came the Washington boys were eager
and ready for the fray. The insurgent
fire, which began about midnight of Feb
ruary 4 at Santa Mesa, just north of them
on the other side of the river, was opened
on King's brigade at 2:30 in the morning
of the ->th. and for several hours the fight
ing was made across the streams separ
ating the two lines. The Americans were
impatient at the comparative inaction and
wanted to go In and whip the enemy out
of hand, but for several hours, however,
they were restrained by their officers un
der orders from the commanding general.
When the word did come, at 8 o'clocK,
Lieutenant Erwin and nearly a score of
men of Company A. which lay near the
stream, had been wounded and two killed
outright; Company I and others had also
suffered more or less severely. At the
word, though covered with mud, wet to
the skin and stiff from the cramped posi
tions they had occupied so long, the
Washingtons sprang up. rushed down the
bank and through the stream, waist deep,
up on the other side and in ten minutes
had .eared the enemy's trenches and the
thickets and ricetields beyond, and sup
ported on either side by the California's,
and Idahos were rushing the enemy to
ward their fortifications before Santa
Ana There were no laggards or shirk
ers, but every man, like the gallant Otis
Of Company A, bore himself like a true
soldier. That officer, severely wounded in
the face as they crossed the stream, was
advised by General King to retire, but
responded: "It's only a scratch, sir; I
can't let my men go In without me." He
but spoke the spirit of the whole regi
ment. :y r - 'â â -'â 
Without a halt, the Washingtons,
flanked on the right by part of the First
California and on the left by the First
Idaho, kept right on toward Santa Ana.
To the left of the road the insurgents
had strong redouts and earthworks,
armed with Krupp guns. They fought
with obstinate courage and no little skid,
especially at the strong redout in front
of Pendacan. It was in the attack on
this place with the two companies of the
Washingtons that he had led across tho
Concordia breast deep that the gallant
Fortson, captain of Company B, received
his mortal wound. But valor and skill
availed the enemy but little against the
onsweep of the Americans, whose cheer
ing lines, sweeping over their works with
the bayonet, in just one hour after the
advance had been ordered captured San. a
Ana and Its arsenal with the guns, re
serve ammunition and supplies of the
Filipino army, none of which they had
time to destroy.
A short halt was made there, however,
leaving a few companies to round up the
prisoners and guard the town. The main
body kept right on after the enemy that,
reinforced from San Pedro Macati, made
another stand on the road to that place.
They were quickly routed, however, and
pursued through the town to Guadalupe,
four miles farther up the river, where
they made another stand behind the con
vent walls, only to be again dislodged and
carried in full flight to Pasig. on the lake,
where they took refuge behind strong in
trenchments. The whole affair had lasted
less than three hours, yet in that briei
time nine fine fellows of the Washington
regiment had fallen in death and fifty
six others were more or less severely
wounded. Company A suffered the most,
losing 2 killed and 16 wounded; E next,
with 4 killed and 5 wounded, and I, with
3 killed and 6 wounded.
The Washington regiment remained in
the vicinity of San Pedro Macati until the
end of the campaign, except when ordered
out for a time on special service. Though
they were not again called upon for such
heavy work as fell to their lot on the
first day, they were under an almost in
cessant fire from the enemy until the ad
vance on June 10 cleared them away south
beyond Imus. On several occasions the
enemy made strong attacks on their lines,

CAMP SANITATION
Paper by Colonel Greenleaf
Surgeon, U. S. A., Before
the County Doctors.
Colonel Green! medical inspector
of all army camps, spoke on camp
sanitation before the County Medical So
ciety last evening.
The theme of Colonel Greenleaf's re
maps was the camps in this city and a
comparison of what they were before the
breaking out of the war and when the
volunteers were first on their way to the
Islands, and what they are now. He men
tioned the sick percentage of Camp \;,. .
rutâ:- was from _' to 30 per centâ and
compared it with the percentage of sick
v l5 V. r *'l"' rteil fr Â°m the camps now at
the Presidio, which never goes over 5 ! ->
per cent. Both camps are equally ex
posed, he said; both camps have the same
climatic conditions and both are built on
the same soil, yet the difference between
the two from a sanitary standpoint is
enormous. .'.-:.
The high degree of sanitation main
tained at the present camps Colonel
Greenleaf attributed to the agency and
assistance of General Shafter. who from
the : -si has shown the utmost concern
for the health of the men.
.ne- nisi una guunu .ue uini-os. concern
for the- health of the men.
They have now two classes to deal with.
he â¢i.lâ the men returning from the
Philippines and subject to all kinds of in
testinal troubles, and those coming in
from the East an.i from all over the
country, liable to all kinds of Infectious
diseases. Both of these classes are being
handled with great success.
Colonel Greenleaf then described the
camps and their construction and the va
rious sanitary arrangements that have
been introduced. He described the sani
tary corps, a body of civilians that is re
sponsible for the cleaning of the camps,
and said that the daily expense of main
taining it reaches $500.
Colonel Greenleaf also told of the pre
cautions to prevent the spread of small
pox among the troops and what measures
were resorted to when it appeared. His
paper was received with much apprecia
tion by the members of the society pres
ent.

A VENTRILOQUIST WILL
WORRY CHIEF I. W. LEES
J. W. WINTON HAS NO LOVE FOR
ISAIAH.
Asserts That the Head of the Local
Police Department Put Words
in His Mouth.
Chief of Police Lees is likely to hear
voices in the night and imagine that some
of the unfortunates he has sent into
"durance vile" have come back to haunt
him if he continues to throw suspicion
on J. W. Winton, the clever ventriloquist,
who will shortly make his second bow to
a local audience from the Orpheum stage.
Winton threatens to stand outside the
bedroom window of the aged chief and
throw his' voice into his apartments if
he breaks a window in the attempt, for
he is seeking revenge.
The head of the police department
gathered the representatives of the three
morning papers around him on Monday
night and delivered a tittle speech about
some new clews he had discovered indi
cating the guilt of the men who robbed
the strongroom of the steamship Ala
meda Without obtaining, permission
from Mr. Winten he put enough words
in his mouth to have him arrested and
incarcerated for complicity in the now
famous robbery. At first Winton, ap
preciated this kind of notoriety as he
thought it would add to his fame as a
mimic and also throw romance around
him. Later, however, it dawned on him
that he was being placed in an unenviable
position by the aged chief, especially so
when one of the papers in bold headlines
stated that "one of the chief's suspects
is back."
To offset this insinuation Winton has
been moving around in his wide circle of
friends and is assuring them that he has
not banked an;. of the missing sovereigns
and that he does not know where they
are located. Despite these assertions his
friends are begging for their share and
Winton perforce has to appease them by
buying sundry liquids. As this is taking
a great deal of American money Winton
wants himself set right before the world.
He admits being a passenger on the
steamer and having been accosted by
Lewis, alias "Murphy," but ho swears he
only had a passing word with him. He
claims that Lewis, recognizing him as a
public man, approached him one day and
Jocularly said that if he < Winton) knew
what he did he would not be working his
"McGlntys," meaning the dummies the
ventriloquist uses in his performance.
Winton stated that he paid no more at
tention to the remark, thinking that it
was a Joke, and in fact did not inquire
what the speaker meant. Now that his
name is brought Into the affair he wishes
It positively stated that he only knows
Lewis by sight, he having been pointed
out to him as being a shady "gun," or
crook, of Australia.

FIGHTING FOR
HIS COUNTRY
Sad Case of James
Harvey, Soldier.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Oct. 10.
The case of James Harvey, the soldier
who for nearly five hours stood motion
less at the corner of Broadway and Fourth
street yesterday, his head thrown back, his
eyes dilated and his muscles contracted,
was examined for insanity to-day by Lu
nacy Commissioners Stratton and Tisdale,
and his case is one of the saddest of its
kind, his mental faculties having been de
stroyed presumably by the hardships en
countered as a soldier in the Philippines.
According to his discharge papers he
was a member of Company B. Twenty
third United States Infantry. He enlisted
May 16, 1 x t . was an engineer Dy occupa
tion and participated in the assault and
capture ot Manila August 13, 1898: also the
assault and capture of Malinta March 26,
1899; also th.- skirmishes near Marquina
February 6, 1899, in the Philippine insur
rection. His discharge reads that he was
an honest and faithful soldier, and that
there are no oltjec tions to his re-enlisting.
He was discharged August 14. 1899, and the
papers were done at Jolo, Philippine Isl
ands. The papers also recount that he
had drawn $191, pay in full.
Harvey's muscles relaxed last evening,
and for a time he seemed rational, but he
was unable to give any account of him
self. Hi was given a potion to bring on
sleep, but this morning exhibited indis
putable symptoms of insanity. '
I-, several hours he raved like a
maniac, shouting and swearing at imag
inary Filipinos and "the niggers." Then
again he became imbued with the halluci
nation that Aguinaldo had finally cap
tured him and that he was doomed to
sure death.
"Oh, God!" he shouted. "They are
sticking their knives and swords into me
now is I lie here, and I know I will never
get out of this." It became necessary to
strap him down, and then he seemed all
the worse and the perspiration poured
down his cheeks. Frequently he would
call to his mother, urging her to see to
brother and that he would care for him
self.
Judge Ogden could get no answers from
him. but the man seemed temporarily
calmed, and hence the court determined
to allow the matter of his commitment to
lay over until to-morrow. Harvey's
father lives in Baltimore, Md.

other argonauts who rounded the Horn

For months Mr. Barker has been look

the dinner and its glad reunion has been
quite the chief thought in his mind. An
Eastern trip, taken in company with his
family, was even shortened that he might
return on time to celebrate the anniver

The party of which Mr. Barker was a
member was formed of eighty men, all
residents of Cayuga County, New York.
They banded together in a joint stock
company, and on the 28th of February,
1849. sailed from New York on the Belve

Investigate First!
Buy Oil Stock
Afterward!
Is the manner In which all prudent
investors would proceed, for the fol-
lowing of that course would ob-
viate all necessity -for rectifying
mistakes should they occur. They
will inquire whether or no a com-
pany is operating on OIL LAND;
if there are any wells near;
what the probable net return would
be from the product of the wells,
and, finally, if the capitalization of
a company would permit of the
small shareholder ever receiving a
DIVIDEND OF ANY SIZE. .
We answer YES to all these ques-
tions. Let us PROVE IT to you.
Until further notice stock will be
sold at $1 per share.

CONRAD'S VICTIM KILLED AS
HE WAS PLEADING FOR MERCY
Burglar Slain in the Midnight Battle With Police
and Citizens of Alameda Identified as Bert
Willmore, Companion of the Majors Boys.

Ex-Convict. Whose Ac

in Folsom-
m * 9 â¦ Â» Â» Â»-â¦-â Â» _Â»-3> Â» Â» Â» Â» Â» q
WHATEVER mystery surround
ed the identity of the burglars
who engaged the police and cit
izens of Alameda in desperate
combat shortly after midnight
Monday morning has been cleared away.
Behind it ail is a story of a boy who was
led into crime, and after serving a part of
his sentence in the State prison was given
a chance to redeem himself, but despite
an heroic effort surrendered to the influ
ences of the companions he had met while
incarcerated in the penal institution. '.'-
The dead burglar has been identified as
Bert Willmore, the companion of the Ma
jors hoys, who created a reign of terror
in the cities across the bay about four
years ago. Of the trio Archie Majors was
killed in a battle to the death with officers
of the law in Utah; Abe Majors is now
under sentence of death for participation
in the crime- that cost his brother his life,
and Bert Willmoreâ the only one of the
youthful gang who attempted to reform
lies on a slab in the Alameda branch
morgue, the victim of the cowardice of
the Chief of Police of the Encinal City.
That the lad was desperate and would
not hesitate to take a human life in his
frantic efforts to escape from the armed
force that was pursuing him, no one will
question, but when "brave" Chief Conrad
fired the bullet that crushed Willmore's
skull and ended his life's romance the boy
was lying prostrate and helpless on the
ground, writhing In pain from the wounds
he had received, his revolver empty and
beyond his reach. It was then that the
Alameda officer stepped from cover and
displayed his nerve and bravery and sent
a bullet crashing through the skull of
Willmore.
The police were In ignorance of the iden
tity of the dead man and his captured
companion until the prisoner consented to
talk. Although the corpse that covered
a slab at the branch morgue was that of a
boy who had participated in the robbery
of nine stores on the main street of the
city in one night, while officers patrolled
up and down in front of the doors, not a
single ono of the sleurhs of the Alameda
force recognized the remains. â¢ The pris
oner, C. C. Sullivan, a pardoned murderer,
who had been an inmate of the Folsom
prison, revealed the identity of his unfor
tunate companion in crime and cleared
up the mist that surrounded the whole
affair. He unfeelingly placed the respon
sibility on the boy, whom he had led into
the scrape and who had been deprived by
death of the chance of defending him
self from the blame of the distressing af
fair. Sullivan poses as a saint among sin
ners, and pictures the boy whom he lured
to his ruin as a sinner among saints.
All the circumstances surrounding the
tragedy point to Willmore's determination
to profit by the past and endeavor to be
come a useful and honorable citizen. His
employers speak of him in the most flat
tering terms, and the foreman at the elec
tric works where he was engaged shed
tears when he learned of his fate. All
these men had given him a helping hand
in his efforts to redeem himself, and their
kindliness had not been wasted until the
man who had been his companion at Fol
som crossed his life and darkened ids
future. His benefactors had warned him
against the evil that beamed from the
man's countenance, and he promised
them to shun him as be would a pesti
lence. He battled bravely to make good
his resolve, but Sullivan would not be
shaken off. He haunted the boy, he
pleaded with him for money, nnd when he
got him completely under his control he
led him into the crime that ended In young
Willmore's cruel and unwarranted killing.
A tie even greater than Sullivan's own
evil influence held the boy in his fatal
grasp. A woman adds a link to the chain
that dragged the youth to bis death. The
sister-in-law of his evil genius was
forced into his life by the designing Sul
livan. Love was made to play a part in
the desperate game, and when Willmore
met his death at the merciless hand of
Alameda's Chief of Police he was the
affianced husband of the woman. She is
Mrs. Eva Thomas, the divorced wife of
Sullivan's brother. She it was who In
response to a telegram from the "brave"
guardian of the law of the Enclnal an
nouncing the death of her lover visited the
Dranch morgue across the bay, and kneel
ing beside the bier of Willmore rave vent
to her feelings In agonizing sobs and at
tested her affection in fervent, earnest
prayer.
Willmore and Sullivan left the State
prison at Folsom December 24, 1898, tho
lormer on parole, the latter pardoned.
The Dead Burglar and Those Who Influenced His Life.
Ex-Adjutant General A. W. Barrett, who
through the tearful pleadings of Will
more's little sister took an interest In the
boy secured him a position with the
Central Light and Power Company. 11. >
worked steadily and faithfully, and all
the reports that General Barrett heard
from his employers were most encourag
ing until a few weeks ago. when he re
ceived information that Willmore was as
sociating with a suspicious character, an
ex-convict. The general sent for the little
Bister, appreciating that her tender inllu
ences over the brother would be far more
effective than his, and informed her of
the boy's danger. Only a day passed
when Willmore called upon the general
and promised faithfully to shun Sullivan.
"It will be a hard thing for me to do,"
was Willmore's statement. "He treated
me like a father while we were at Fol
som, and now I hardly have the heart to
cast him off. He will not leave me. He
pleads for assistance, and I am not in a
position to give it to him. I know that 1
must leave him alone, for something tells
me that association with him will result
In no good to me." .â¢
And yet, with this presentiment of dan
ger and the warning of his friends, Will
more did not have the will power to re
sist the entreaties of the Evil One. They
continued to meet, but not In the open.
Sullivan himself admits that their meet
ings were in dark alleys and in out-of-the
way places where they would be unob
served. And it was thus that the Alameda
burglary was planned. Suillvan says that
Willmore, discouraged at his financial
condition, determined upon robbery for
relief. He poses as the saint by observ
ing that he pleaded with his dead com
panion not to stray from the narrow path.
but when argument and pleading were or
no avail he determined to stand by the
hoy in case anything should happen to
him; and that, he says, is how he came to
he in Alameda on the night of the burg
lary.
Willmore cannot tell his story. That he
was discouraged or had any reason to be
is denied by his employers. His wages
were on the increase. His work had been
so satisfactory that he had been prom
ised a raise of $10 every other month
until his salary reached $70. His home
life was happy. He lived for his mother
and the little sister lna whose pleadings
had secured him clemency from the
Board of State Prison Directors through
the intercession of General Barrett. His
salary was not large, but still, with tho
earnings of lna with her needle, lt enabled
the mother and daughter and son to live
comfortably and happily.
Their home is at 823 Mission street. A
pathetic incident in the sad case was the
persistent refusal of Mrs. Willmore and
lna, when seen yesterday afternoon, to
believe that the boy had been slain. So
positive were they that he was still alive
and well that they laughed at the sug
gestion that any harm had come to him. 1
They even asserted that he had not left
home until Monday morning, and conse
quently could not have been killed in Ala
meda the night before. The mother re
members Sullivan. He called at her home
on one occasion and Inquired for Bert.
His features were so repulsive that she
ordered him away and cautioned him not
to associate with her boy.
And now to the scene of death and the
alleged bravery of the two Alameda po
lice, who have posed as heroes of the
bloody affair. Officer Hadley, who first
encountered Sullivan and Willmoro in the
store of Gott, the jeweler, did not fire a
shot. He fled from the scene as soon
as Willmore fired at him and broke his
shoulder in his haste to fall out of danger
over a high board fence. His story that
his revolver refused to work after he had
fired the first shot is not correct. Fright
had complete possession of him and his
palsied hand could not pull the trigger
even had he waited to use his weapon.
His heroism consists of losing a piece of
cuticle from the tip end of his little
finger, which he thoughtlessly placed in
front of one of the flying bullets.
Conrad's bravery was on a parallel with
that of the patrolman. When Willmore
shot at him from behind the picket fence
on Central avenue the Chief, according
to the testimony of reputable eye-wit
nesses. scurried out of danger behind a
protecting telegraph pole. Willmore was
then riddled with buckshot and a bullet
had shattered his thigh bone. He fell
forward through the fence, face down on
the sidewalk and with uplifted hand fired
into the air the last shot in his revolver.
In desperation he continued to work the
trigger of the weapon and its repeated
click, click, click, told that the pistol was
empty. In despair he threw it from him.
It was then that the hero, Conrad,
stepped from his place of shelter and
walking up to the prostrate form sped
the bullet that shot away the back of
the boy's head. Citizens who live across
the street from the scene of carnage as
sert that they heard Willmore pleading
pitifully for mercy before the last shot,
which was followed by the order to carry
the man away on a stretcher.
Conrad was not hit by any flying bul-

lets, as he asserted when he was laving
the foundation for a claim of heroism.
The scratch on his neck was not the re
sult of any whizzing leaden missile. Ex
perts are ready to testify that the dainty
wound was made by a rosebush or pos
sibly the "brave" Chiefs finger nail.

At the inquest held this evening by Dr.
C. H. Mehrmann, Coroner of Alameda
County, over the body of the burglar who
was killed while trying to escape, by
Chief Conrad, tho above verdict was ren
dered. Among the witnesses called by
the Coroner to testify at the inquest were
lna Willmore, a sister of the dead man;
H. O. Tenny of 1361 Park street, who
warned the police; Chief of Police John
Conrad, who fired the fatal shot; C. P.
Magagnos. a dealer in photographic sup
plies at 2313 Central avenue, who was
with the Chief when the shooting oc
curred; George H. Brown, a policeman
who aided In the capture of Sullivan: Dr.

J. M. Young, who participated in the
chase and ' afterward attended the dead
man at the police station shortly before
he expired. No testimony was elicited
that has not already been published in
The Call.
After the inquest Miss Willmore stated
that she believed her brother was led to
commit crime because he was discour
aged. She said he received but $35 a
month, out of which he supported her
mother and herself and had no money
to clothe and buy himself the comforts of
life; that he was a good brother and a
good son and anything said to the con
trary was untrue.
Miss Willmore tried to secure the Smith

to kill his pursuers, but was unsuccessful.

WILLMORE'S CAREER
OF CRIME IN OAKLAND
OAKLAND. Oct. 10.â The story of the
Majors and Willmore boys is without par
allel in the criminal annals of California.
The Majors and Willmore families have
been so closely allied for the past four
years that they have been as brothers and
sisters, the connecting link between them
being young lna, now about 17 years old.
In the summer of 1896, after a long suc
cession of burglaries had been committed,
two of these lads were caught returning
from a night of robbery in Alameda. They
confessed all their misdeeds, which in
cluded safe-blowing, burglaries and rob
beries. â¢:..â¢-
At the time of their arrest they were

more, near the First Presbyterian Church,
lna Willmore, then 14, was the sweetheart
of Abe Majors and one of his excuses for
entering on a life of crime was his desire
to make her valuable presents.
The boys were sentenced to ten years
in Folsom. Archie Majors was away from
Oakland at the time of the burglaries,
and after his brother's sentence showed a
desire to lead an honorable life. He wan
dered away from Oakland and put in
some time as a cowboy in Texas, but
when Abe Majors was released on parole
Archie joined him and they went off to
gether. Nothing was heard of them for
some months until they were met by a
Sheriff's posse in Utah.
Last Christmas eve Bert Willmore was
released from Folsom, having been par
doned by Governor Budd because of his
excellent behavior. Nothing has been
heard of the boy in Oakland since leaving
the penitentiary.

TROUBLE CAUSED
FOR SEAMEN BY

Aberdeen Lost Part of
Her Deckload.
THE PORT PATRICK DRIFTED
â¦
The Storm Blew Down a Boor on the
Mail Dock Which Knocked Stone
- Overboardâ Austra
lia in Port.
Captains of vessels in port have been
preparing for a storm during the last
twenty-four hours. A low barometer gave
them warning Monday night and yester
day afternoon the weather bureau or
dered the northwest storm signals dis
played. On the vessels at the north end
of the water front extra mooring lines
were got out, while in many Instances
straw fenders were put between the ves
sels and the wharves to keep them from
chafing. Out in the stream extra an
chors were let go. but the British ship
Port Patrick was caught napping. She
began to drag and before the second an
chor could be dropped she had drifted
down on the Postal Telegraph Company's
cable.
A week ago the big pile raft broke the
cable as it was towed up the bay. A
gang of men was set to work and the
tugs Alert and Transit employed and by
Sunday morning the cable was repaired
and in working order again. Now it is
again broken and it will be several days
before another one can be laid. The tug
Relief was sent out to move the Port
Patrick, but she was too late to prevent
the damage.
A very heavy storm has been raging
off the coast and evefy vessel making
port has had a hard time of it. Captain
Houdlette of the mail streamer Australia
says it blew very hard from the north
west during the last part of the voyage,
and Captain Smith of the City of Peking
and Captain Saunders of the Newport had
similar experiences. All of them agree
in saying that the storm was accompa
nied by a heavy westerly swell.
The steamer Aberdeen "caught it" off
Point Reyes. The northwest storm w as
accompanied by mountainous seas, one of
which broke aboard. The deck lashings
were broken and part of the deckload was
washed away. Some of the lumber
caught in the rigging and pulled the
mainmast out of the vessel. The engine
room and cabin were flooded and for a
time it looked as though the fires under
the boilers would be put out. Captain
Pedersen got his vessel before the gale
and kept her there until repairs were
made, after which he came on to San
Francisco. The Aberdeen was docked at
Lombard street wharf, and following an
examination of her damages she was
towed to Oakland Creek to discharge.
The Aberdeen was from Portland with
600,000 feet of lumber. M;.-;
Customs Inspector J. T. Stone had a
narrow escape on the Mail dock. The
wind blew one of the doors down and in
its fall it knocked Stone into the water
and then fell on top of him. Luckily he
was under water when the door struck
the surface and so escaped injury. Be
j ing a good swimmer he was rescued by
: some of the wharf hands who threw him
i a line.
The transport Newport docked at the
! Government wharf yesterday afternoon.
: Captain Saunders is a very sick man, and
has been ever since the vessel left Ma
nila. The chances are that he will not go
out on. the steamer next trip. The New
port had a hard time of it In the storm
off the Japan coast that delayed the So
lace, Tartar, Pennsylvania and City of
Peking. During the first ten days out
she only made a thousand miles, while
under ordinary circumstances she would
have made 3500. One of .the port lifeboats
was smashed into kindling wood and some
of the- dead lights were stove in. The sol
diers aboard got a great scare, as they
made sure the vessel would never reach
port again.
The Australia, from Honolulu," brought
up forty-three cabin and forty steerage
passengers. There was a coal famine in
the islands and the mail boat had to get
! 240 tons of coal from the Government. She
had enough fuel in her bunkers to bring
her to San Francisco, but in the event
of heavy weather she might have run
short, so after considerable pressure the
agents of the vessel got the 240 tons from
the Government. The cabin passengers
of the Australia were:
A. XV. Anderson, S. C. Allen and
wife, C. F. Bradshaw, E. B. Barthorp,
P. N. Berenger, Mrs. C. E. Camp, F.

HITE ADMIRED HER.
Agreed "With His Friend That Lucy
Was Good Looking.
The trial of the divorce case of Hite
vs. Hite was resumed yesterday morning
before Judge J. P. Jones of Contra Costa
County, who ls holding court In this city.
The morning session was taken up en
tirely by the reading of depositions of
several witnesses. In the afternoon
Thomas Gibbs, a half-breed son of the
plaintiff, was called to testify to the al
leged signatures of John R. Hite, the de
fendant, on the register of El Capltan
Hotel in Mariposa, but his evidence was
not admitted. Later plaintiff's counsel of
fered in evidence a grocery bill made in
the name of John R. Hite for Lucy Hite,
and claimed that it was one of many ren
dered to Mr. Hite headed in the same
way. Defendant's counsel objected to the
bill being offered in evidence, and after
a long argument Judge Jones sustained
the objection.
Charles H. Swain was called as a wit
ness for plaintiff and testified that in
1881, while at Hite's mine as an expert
examining the mine, he first saw Lucy
Hite. It was while sitting in the gro
cery store with John R. Hite and a man
named Ferris that Lucy entered and
bowed to Hite. Ferris spoke up and said:
"Hite, that's a good looking squaw," and
Hite replied: "Yes, I think so; that's my
wife." Witness further stated that
"every one far and wide spoke of Lucy
as Hite's wife." On cross-examination
by Attorney Foote witness stated that he
had been superintendent of many mines
on this coast, but not of any dividend
paying ones. ..- â ,Â»
In her deposition Mrs. Grove, defend
ant's sister, deposed that while visiting
her brother at Hites Cove she had looked
upon Lucy as a good and faithful serv
ant and had never regarded Lucy as
John's wife. Lucy had never sat at the
table with her and Mr. Hite.
The trial will be resumed to-day.
WIFE AGAINST HUSBAND.
Mrs. Johanna Coughlin Wants Her
Spouse Arrested for Felony
Embezzlement.
Mrs. Johanna Coughlin, 39 Clara street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Treadwell's
court yesterday for the arrest of her hus
band, Cornelius, on the charge of felony
embezzlement. She accuses him of em-
bezzling between $1600 and $1700 which he
drew from the Hlbernia Ban.: and intend
ed to use in deserting her and their two
children.
Mrs. Coughlin stated that she and her
husband had saved the money during
their seventeen years of married life. It
was deposited in the bank in their joint
names. Some time ago she drew out $4.0
to enable her husband to go East on a
trip, but after his return she had occa
sion to get an injunction from the courts
to prevent him from drawing any money
without their joint consent. The bank did
not recognize the injunction and allowed
her husband to draw out the balance of
the money, and she had reason to believe
that he intended to leave the city.
