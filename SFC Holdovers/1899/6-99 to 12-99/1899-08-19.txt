VOLUME LXXXVI-NO. 80.
BOERS MAY NOW
PRECIPITATE WAR
Such Opinion Expressed by Ad
miral Howison in a Report
on the Transvaal.
Special Dispatch to The Cal
rALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, Aug. IS.â ln a report re
\^4 ceived at the Navy Department
from Rear Admiral Howison,
thai officer describes the tension exist-
Ing between the Transvaal and Great
Britain and his report indicates that
war may be precipitated by the hot
hesdedness of the Boers.
Though Rear Admiral Howison was
not sent to the Transvaal upon any
diplomatic mission he went to that
country when the Chicago arrived at
Pelagoa Ray last month and joined the
Phip at Cape Town, after having made
a careful study of the conditions pre
vailing in sections through which he
passed. Because cf the important
recommendations made by the rear ad
miral and his statements respecting
the conditions of the itlanders, the
authorities are disinclined to make his
report public. It would not be surpris
ing in the event of war if the British
Government requested the United
States to take care of its interests in
the Transvaal and a ship from the
South Atlantic station will undoubtedly
be sent to Delagoa Bay to look out for
American interests.
According to Rear Admiral Howison
there can only be one result of a war
between Great Britain and the South
African republic â the absorption of the
latter country. The Boers are deter
mined, however, to fight for their inde
oendence. They migrated years ago to
.heir present homes in order to escape
foreign domination and.they are de
:erinined to maintain their Independ
nce or die in its defense. It is appar
el that Real Admiral Howison sympa
:hize? with th. Outlanders. as he says
hey pay five-sixths of the taxes and
â¢epreseht three-fifths of the wealth of
he country. There is no doubt, he
hinks. that th Boer Government is
cry favorably inclined toward Ameri
can citizens. But it cannot extend prlv
lepes to them not accorded to citizens
if other nations because of the appli
cation of the most favored nation
lause and the necessity of treating all
oreigners alike.
Rear Admiral Howison describes the |
Âirr-o Â«.-i fabulously rich, and devotes!
. portion of report t<> the onar&c- ;
<-ristics of the Boers. He says they
ire very superstitious, and mentions
he declination of the Volksraad to pass |
i bill for ridding the country of the j
rrasshopper scourge and for overeom
ng the effects of drought, the reason '<
;!ven being that it would be unwise to |
ittempt to thwart the will of Provi
lence.
It is apparent from reading the rear
idmlral's report that be believes the
3o^rs have put themselves in as good
-ondition of readiness as possible, but
t is evident he sees but one outcome
o a war â their subjugation.

NO SPECIAL TRAIN FOR
NEBRASKA VOLUNTEERS
Governor Poynter Was Unable to Se

doned the Project.
OMAHA. Aug. IS.â Governor Poynter
to-day abandoned the project of pro
viding a special train for the First Ne
braska regiment and the disbanded vol
unteers will be forced to use the travel
ing allowance granted by the Govern
ment. Over 515.000 had been pledged
by private subscription, leaving $20,000
still to be raised.
The Governor issued a proclamation.
in which he states that he resorted to
every possible measure to secure the
funds without result. Bankers and
other wealthy men of Omaha and Lin
coln were appealed to, he says, to ad
vance the money on his promise to call
upon the Legislature for a return of
principal and interest. Following their
refusal the railroads were appealed to
to return the soldiers and accept a
â laim against the State. This request
was denied by the different lines and
the project was abandoned.
The proclamation ends with an ex
pression of regret that Nebraska has
railed to accord to its vqluijteexs^tha
*ame practical honors given- by Other
States. The railroads are arraigned for
indifference to the' interests o.f Ne
braska and for lack of practical pa
triotism.
PRESIDENT REVIEWS THE

With a Silk Flag.
PLATTSBURG. N. V.. Aug. 18.â
Promptly at 4 o'clock this afternoon
the cannon on the parade ground at
Plattsburg Barracks boomed out a
Presidential salute, signifying that
President McKinley had arrived at the

Griggs and Mrs. Griggs and their two
daughters and Secretary of the Inte
rior Hitchcock.
Mrs. McKinley presented a handsome
silk flag to the regiment. Colonel Rice
received It in behalf of his men. The
flag was then given to the color ser
geant of the company, who bore it back
to his place in the ranks. Then the en
tire regiment, headed by the regimental
band, passed in review before the Pres
ident. President McKinley' spoke in the
highest terms of the soldiers. The regi
ment will leave for Manila in about
two weeks.
After the review the members of the
Presidential party were entertained at
lunch by Colonel and Mrs. Rice. The
remainder of the day was spent rather
quietly by the President, as the
weather was decidedly warm.

INDIAN ARRESTED FOR
MURDER OF VEITINGER
Sheriff Jennings Claims He Has Suf

to Convict Him.

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 1599.
LIPTON'S YACHT HAS
REACHED NEW YORK
Rapid Trip Across the Atlantic of the
â  Shamrock, Challenger for the
America's Cup.
LIPTON'S YACHT SHAMROCK AND TENDER ERIN.
NESW YORK. Aug. 18.âWith Sir
Thomas Upton's private signal,
a shamrock on a gold ground,
bordered by a broad band of
green, at her topmast truck and
the British naval reserve ensign at her
jigger masthead, the hull of the chal
; lenging yacht Shamrock, swinging at
1 anchor to the ebb tide off Tompklns
j vllle this morning bore a striking re
i semblance to that of the Columbia. She j
;is painted a light green. If painted
; white it would be a difficult matter at
} a distance to distinguish the yachts by
! their hulls.
In her trip across the Atlantic the
| Shamrock carried a loose-footed main
sail of heavy canvas, having, besides
j_LhÂ£eÂ£~Â£e,is of reef points, a "bonnet" In
the tooi of it. ,Her "jib stay sets up with
I a turnbuckle to the end of a bowsprit
j extending not more than four feet out
board. No gaff was carried on the jig
' ger mast, the sail being of the leg-of
-1 mutton type.
Straight as a reed and very strong'
is the Shamrock's mainmast. It is held
by three steel wire shrouds on each
side, set up with turnbuckles. A great
| deal of the green paint has been
j washed off the bows of the yacht where
i she pounded in the heavy swells, leav-
I ing her bronze plates bare and show
i ing the fine, smooth riveted work done
!by the builders. Besides a big lap
streak cutter, carried on a pair of brass
davits, the Shamrock carried two col
â  lapsible lifeboats on deck. Her long
tiller, with which she was steered, is
covered with canvas.
Conspicuous on -the yacht's deck
' amidships between the skylights and
: waterways are four large wood cleats,
secured by brass bolts. There are two
on each side, presumably one being
j used for belaying the main sheet and
I one for the staysail sheet. Two smaller
wooden cleats, forward of those named,
â  are for the jib sheets.
The deck itself is of steel, covered at
! present with tarred canvas. There are
fore and aft battens like those used on
the Columbia and the Defender to pre
nings, after. a great deal of investiga
tion, claims that he has the murderer
of Jacob J. Yeifinger in custody. Vei
! tinger was a German, 72 years old, who
I lived alone in a cabin in Lee Valley.
! thirty-five miles east of this city, and
I was found shot and burned to death in
the runins of his cabin on July 28.
A day or two following the discovery
of the tragedy an Indian named Chavez :
Kstudero was arrested on. suspicion,
having been seen in the vicinity of the
cabin on the day of the tragedy, but

â¦ LONDON, Aug. IK. â Sir â¦
â â¦â  Thomas Upton is naturally very â¦
â¦ much delighted with the news â â¢â¦â 
â¦ that the Shamrock has arrived â¦
â¦ safely in New York harbor, and â¦
â¦ ' is also much pleased by the re- â¦
â¦ poTts which have reached here â¦
â¦ that his yacht met with such an â¢â¦â 
â¦â¢ enthusiastic welcome as she en- â¦
â¦ tered the harbor. â¦
â¦ When asked what he thought â¦
â¦ about the Shamrock being towed â¦
â¦ two thousand miles as reported â¦
â â¦â  here, he replied that there was â¦

â¦ in a dead calm, but it was, â of â â¦
.â¦- CQUrse, those on -\the>ntlÂ»er~sideâ â¦
â¦â¢ now who- could tell most about it. .-4
--â¦ Anyhow, it was great eatisfac- ; â¦

vent the crew from sliding overboard
during a race.
The crew are a sturdy looking lot of
Scotch and English men. They wore
blue jerseys, bearing on the breast the
words "Shamrock, R. U. Y. C." The
same words appear on the yacht's
stern.
The steam yacht Erin flies, besides
Sir Thomas Upton's private signal, the
colors. of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club.'
The Shamrock reached port this
morning, accompanied by her tender,
the steam yacht Erin. The Shamrock
sailed from Fairlie, on the Clyde., Au
gust 3. and made the trans-Atlantic
voyage In much quicker time than was
anticipated.
The Erin towed the Shamrock about
2000 miles and the latter sailed some
thing more than 1200 miles. Her best
day's run under canvas was 26S knots.
Most of the towing was done after
passing the Azores, August 19. At
quarantine the yachts were promptly
cleared.
the authorities held no strong evidence
against the Indian beyond the fact that
he was believed to have had a gun.
which he had mysteriously disposed of
in some manner when he was arrested.
It has since been learned that Estu
dero, on the day following the murder
of Veitinger, attempted to steal a young
squaw at El Cajon, not far from Vei
tinger's place, and became involved in
a row with another Indian who de
fended the squaw. In the trouble the
woman's protector secured possession
of the gun which Estudero attempted
to use, and this has since come into
possession of Sheriff Jennings, along
with much other evidence which al
most conclusively fixed the crime upon
Estudero. â 
The gun is believed to be the weapon
formerly owned by the murdered Ger
man,' and which could not be found In
the ruins of the burned cabin. In the
effort to find this gun a deputy sheriff
was compelled to travel hundreds of
miles over the mountains of Lower
California in a search for the Indian
who took it from Estudero. The dep
uty also brought back information that
will be of great assistance to the au
thorities. . Sheriff. Jennings claims
that stronger circumstantial evidence
against Estudero would be hard to
find.
CRAMPS THREATENED
WITH A BIG STRIKE
Recent Wholesale Discharges Have
Caused the United Machinists
to Take Action.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. IS.â A secret
meeting of the machinists employed at
Cramps' ship-building yards was held
to-night. Frederick Kunzelman, an
official of the local Machinists' Asso
tion, and formerly employed at
Cramps', stated that the recent whole
sale discharges â¢at the ship yards were
made for the purpose of intimidating
the men. Recently 500 employes were
discharged from the various depart
ments in the yard, and it was intimated
that many more would, follow. The
reason given by the firm was the scar
city of structural,* "on. Mr. . Kunzel
man asserts that ihe machinists are
not affected by this shortage and that
there is enough work to keep them busy
for two years. He says | further ,.-. that
the . employes â¢ were preparing to de
mand a nine-hour das and, thAt - the
After the yachts had anchored in the
unpei" bay Captain Archie Hogarth of
the Shamrock said:
"The Shamrock behaved beautifully.
I am more than satisfied with her. In
fact, I am delighted, because my most
sanguine anticipations have been more
than realized. But I will say this, that,
gleeful as I am with thf behavior of
the boat, I was more surprised with
the generous reception which she got
from the time we were abreast of
Sandy Hook."
Dr. Mackay of Edinburgh, who was
aboard the Erin, acted as spokesman
for Captain Matthews, who was busily
engaged looking after the routine work
on the Erin. The doctor expressed him
self ja6 being delighted with the trip
over, and said that no incident of any
moment occurred during the entire trip.
He said both boats, with th*=> Shamrock
in the lead, left Fairlie at 5:45 p. m.,
August 3. Favorable winds prevailed
and the Shamrock went past the Isle
of Man with all sails set. Up to Tues
day, the Bth, moderate seas prevailed,
but then heavy weather set in, ac
companied by a fog in which the Erin
lost sight of the Shamrock. Heavy seas
swept over the decks of the Erin and
the Shamrock was equally deluged. On
the morning <>f the Oth the Erin picked
up the Shamrock and Captain
Matthews figured that th^y were then
226 miles fr"om Corvo, in the Azores.
Pleasant weather followed. On the
11th a dead calm was experienced, fol
lowed by head winds. The Erin then
took the Shamrock in tow, and during
the 12th and 13th and part of the 14th
Bhe towed the sloop, on which all sails
were up. A slight breeze from the
north northeast continued until the
lath. On the 16th a heavy swell made
both boats rock, but their speed was
not impaired. On the following day
several steamers were signaled. At 7
o'clock the pilots hoarded the two
yachts and brought them into port.
Sir Thomas Upton is exrected here
on the Campania, which will sail from
Queenstown nine days hence.

i forestall this movement. Another meet

: thority f->r the statement that if 500
machinists agree to strike the entire
4000 employes now at work will go out
as a protest against the action of thr
Cramps in making the discharges.

STRENGTHENS THE
DREYFUS DEFENSE
Colonel Picquart Confronts Gen
erals in His Testimony Before
Court-Martial
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Pros.
RENNES, Aug. 19. â The trial of Dreyfus was resumed this morning
at 6:30 o'clock, no special incidents marking the opening of the proceed
ings.
The first witness was Captain Guignet, an aid de camp at the Min
istry of War, who was commissioned by General Gonse last year to
classify and arrange the different documents connected with the Drey
fus. Esterhazy and Picquart affairs.
Captain Guignet declared that he was convinced of the guilt of the
accused.
RENNES, August 18.â A severe
blow to the military sot it was
when the Schneider dispatch
was made known at 5 o'clock
this morning in the refectories
and the hotels. It was a source of ju
bilation to the other side.
General Mercier had greatly empha
sized its importance when giving his
I testimony. His manner was victorious
'as he handed the alleged letter -if
Colonel Schneider to the president of
the court-martial, to be added to and
filed with the other papers connected
with the trial. These generals at
Rennes have no standing counsel to ad
vise them. They show forensic ability
in making speeches when they ought to
be giving evidence, but they lack law
yer-like prudence and legal practice.
Many an advocate would have felt
how risky it was to dwell on such a
I document as an intercepted letter from
a military attache, especially in view of
the forgeries with which the secret
dossiers teemed. After all that has
i transpired about the letters of military
; attaches to each other in 1994. the at
! taches in self-defense wore bound to
1 discredit everything in the secret dos
'. siers. These letters were supported by
police reports. Were they published
the world woujld read them aghast. As
â  at least Il'T persons in all must hava
Been them, the authors, real or alleged,
would find themselves on the defensive.
But these considerations never present
ed themselves to General Mercier's
mind. That he believed in the authen-
tieity of his document and pinned his
. faith to it is now laughed at every
where. His best friends call him a
, donkey, and his enemies rejoice.
Colonel Panizzardi trumps Colonel
I Schneider's denial of his alleged letter

regarding the relations of Colonel

' Colonel Panizzardi mak^s use of that

I statement so far as it dealt with the al

--] tions to Rome, where they were posted
in the hotels for the edification of the
patrons.
The Austrian and Italian embassies
; attest the genuineness of the Schneider
! and Panizzardi dispatches. Mercier
I feels that he has thrown the fat into
'â¢ the fire, and he looked depressed and
, out of- countenance to-day. So did
Roget, who is a stronger man, notwith
standing the tears he shed at the close
of his deposition yesterday. They both
were tired and pale throughout the
tiresome humiliation.
Colonel Picquart was again a witness.
He was allowed to sit in an armchair.

is strange, but not unpleasing-. Thn
aquiline nose is far too long. Th?
eyes are blue and of poetic expression.
but the heavy, drooping lids give them
a triangular shape. The prevailing ex
pression of his countenance is sad.
Still it sh^ws mental serenity. His de
fects are diffuseness, too great facility
and a drawn-out style. He does not
force his conviction in swift, strong
Hashes. He is not graphic and never
goes direct to the root of the matter.
But he is not tedious. The beautiful
voice saves him from that. It makes
the listener patiently follow him
through the mazes of argument, deduc
tion and demonstration. His arrange
ment of arguments is cumulative.
The presiding judge rubbed him often
against the grain and often begged him
not to be diffuse, not to speak so
much about his own concerns, but to
keep to the Dreyfus affair. Picquart
respectfully accepted these reproofs.
Baying he only spoke of his own con
cerns in order to vindicate his char
acter and t<> prove himself a creditable
witness. HÂ» spent two hours yesterday
and four to-day in giving evidence ar.<l
remaining guardian angel of Dreyfus,
standing between him and the im
placÂ«h;o onemies who sit on the front
seat of the witnesses.
In this row are (Jenerals Mercier and
Roget, and many field officers who are
still unheard. How bitterly and
hatingly they eyed Picquart to-day.
General Billot, however, did not ap
parently share in their ferocious feel
ings. He seemed unruffled by Pic
quart's statements. Billot was on the
staff of Bazaine in Mexico and escaped
from Metz. H<? is a born politician,
and is always guided by the instinct of
self-preservation. But he is not a bad
man. He took from Metz to Tures in
1870 a commission as colonel which
Marshal Bazaine had signed, showed
it to Gambetta and then tore it up.
Gambetta at once confirmed it. and
thfn promoted him bjgher. He is a type
of the old red. red sergeant one might
see playing- cards in a provincial cafe
with a pipe and a .class of absinthe.
Those who do not know his history aiv
, amazed to think he was thrice a Mm;
-; ister of War and is a life Senator.
The Dreyfusites greatly fear for Pic-
I quart's life. The stalwarts among
1 them now guard him. He looks a man
with an unpropitious star, and he has
always been unlucky, unless in havinpr
'â  that 'peace of soul that passeth under

experts at the court-martial of uM Pic
proceeded to examine the secret
dossier, a close analysis of which, he
asserted, was particularly necessary
owing to the weight the document had
with the members of the court-maru d
"This dossier," continued the witness, j
"may be divided Into two parts. The j
first" contains three do uinetits. One Is *
known as the d'Avlgiiun document, the
terms of which are about as follows:
â¢Doubt th>- proofs, service letters; situa
tion dang- rous for me with French ofii
cer; no Information from an officer of the
mportant onlyas coming from the 1
Ministry: already somewhere else.' Two
The document containing the words
'cette canaille de D â .' Three- A docu
ment which is nothing but the report of :
a Journey to Switzerland made in behalf
of a foreign power.
"The second part of the dossier," con
tinued Picquart, "consisted chiefly ol a
supplementary review of the first. It con
tained the gWI ol seven or right docu
ments, which, 'cette canaille de
D ,' will serve for the purpose of com
parison. It alÂ«o contained ;he correspond
ence of atUu hes A and B. These initials.

polonel Bchwarak ippe'n, formerly German ' :
military attache at Paris, and Major Pan-
Izzardf, the former military attache of I
Italy at the French capital.
A' this Juncture the colonel said it
would facilitate his explanation if he were
permitted to Bee the secret dossier, add
ing: "I have already had it In my hands,
but 1 fear my metnorj may fail m- on
some polius."
'What you a.=k." replied the president
of the court-marttal, "is impossible.. The
Minister's orders are absolute. The secret j
d< BSler ran only be examined under cer- I
â ulttions."
I r>gret it." answered Picquart," but I '
will try to refresh tnv memory."
The wit'- explained why Major
Dv Paty ile Clam's translation of the
Avignon document. which he had
â i as Idiotic, was open to doubt, and
why that document, if it had any mean-
Ing whatever, was as applicable to Ester
haxy as to l >rej lus.
R< garding the correspondence of the
military attaches, tin: witness demon- |
strated the Insignificance of the Informa
tion asked tor. While Dv Paty de Clam
regarded the correspondence as convinc
ing and as clearly Indicating an officer of
bui eau, Pli quai I maintained
that the terms of the correspondence mdi- ;
cated thai the writer Intended to ask a
friend and not a spy for the information
;. Many headquarters officers. hÂ«
pointed out, were on cordial and abso
lutely legitimate terms with the foreign
ltj attaches. Colonel Pic<juart then
took up the "Cette canaille de l> docu
ment. He called the- attention of the
t that it was ad dr. Sed
by Bchwarskoppen to Panizzardl and not
vice versa, as long believed. After giving
his reasons for believing Dreyfus was not
t! : . person referred to in that document.
Picquart showed how De Clam endeav
ored to ascribe the authorship of the doc
ument to Par.izzardi. with the view of
establishing a connection which in reality,
did not exist between the various' docu- 1
rnents In the Indictment against Dfeyfus.
The document referring to the French
as p nt's. Journey to Switzerland; of which
Bchwarzkoppen is said to have hc-rn in-.
d, was only slightly commented
upon by the witness, as he did not attach
Importance to it.
The minute, detail with which the j
colonel dealt With the evidence, the |
clearness of his language and his deduc
tions had great effect upon the audience
and elicited general admiration. The for-;
mer chief of the Intelligence department
concluded his examination of the lirst por- I
tion of the secret dossier by saying:
"May I be allowed to express deep re- |
gret it the absence of Major dv Pan ie i
Clam It seems to me indispensable that j
this officer, who wrote the commentaries !
on the secret dossJer, should be summoned
to give evidence nere. He would give us J
ins reminiscences rum l would neip n:m.
I Laught< r. i
"But," added Picquart, "since I am i
dealing with this question of commenta- ]
I Major dii Paty de Clam, permit
me to point out to you. gentlemen, that
i Ins document was no{ the property of
any particular Minister. It was class
elonging to the intelligence Depart
ment, and. as you see. it formed part of
a well defined dossierâ a dossier which
v. s shut up in one of the drawers of ray
and which was abstracted from It.
This commentary, therefore, is upon a
â¢ dossier document which was im
properly removed from my department."
(S< nsation.)
ng, the witness said: "Mention
wa 2 made yesterday of the disappearance
of documents. That is the case in point."
Turning to the second part of the dis-
U< r Colonel I'ico.uart said a number of
document!" in it are forgeries and said the
police reports therein contained showed !
nothing serious against Dreyfus. Fie ex
plained that they embodied the theme i
mostly utilized by police spies in order
to dupe the Intelligence Department, and
asserted that th-ir Information was
mostly worthless, embroidered or false â  r
prepared in order to make Interesting
reading.
"In the Inquiry made by M. Quesnay fli>
Beaurepaire" (fonrer President of the
civil se< tion of the Court of Cassation^,
continued colonel Picquart, "you have nn
excellent example of the soft of p.
who can present In the most specious
uui.-e what amounts to absolutely noth
ing. Yon cannot Imagine gentlemen.
what people, In order to get money, if
only a modest 20-franc piece, have brought '
to the Intelligence Department in the!
shape of so-called 'information.' whl< h i
examination has proved to be worthless."
Dreyfus displayed the keenest Interest
in PJcquart's protracted analysis of the
dossier, to which the whole audience i
listened with it.. found attention. The
members of the court-martial and the i
former Ministers of War were equally in
terested. Of the latter Generals Billot
and Zurlinden were in full uniform. Gen
eral Mercier was attired In civilian
clothes. N'tar them sat M. Bertulus the
â â â aiining magistrate, who gave such
strong testimony for Dreyfus yesterday.
Madame Henry, widow of Lieutenant
Colonel Henry, who taxed M. Bertulus
with being a Judas, was not present.
concluding his examination ol the i
secret dossier, Colonel Picquart explained
how he ha<l acquired the conviction that
the bordereau was written by Esterhazy
.and how he ascertained that the auti-
Preyfus proofs were worthless. He be
gan by detailing how he first learned of
the existence ol Esterhazy and his efforts
to discover something about him The
1 â¢ ess earnestly asserted that the first
occasion on which he saw Esterhaxy was
when he read the address of the petit bleu
He Bald hÂ« was not acquainted with and
never had Esterhazy watched. Previous
to this effort had been made to prove the
contrary and show Picquart knew Bster
hasy before the discovery of the petit blue.
'lonel emphasized this point with
â¢ v . as explained, of showing how cer
tain newspapers had travestied the facts
and he created a mild sensation by add
ing: "I shall have occasion to point OUI
otner and similar examples."
The witness then rebutted the charges
made against him- of unnecessarily delay-
Ing the prosecution of Esterhazy. He said
his object was to avoid arousing suspicion
in regard to an officer who, perhaps, was
entirely innocent.
"What a mistake." he added, "won: !
have been averted in IÂ«S4 had they acted
In the same way in regard to Dreyfus!"
This remark caused murmurs of ap- :
prcval in court.
What the witness gathered ahout Ester- !
hazy's character, be continued, created i
the worst, impression upon him. bur !â¢
â¢ i nothing to connect Esterhazv
with any act of espionage. Therefor, he
did not mention his suspicions. An agi mi.
however, was ordered to watch Eetor
hazy, who had completely compromised
himself through his relations with an
El gllsh company of which he had agreed ;
to bee >me a director.
"That could not be permitted in the cast
of a French officer." said Picquart. More
over, Esterhazy gambled, led a life of de
bauchery and lived with Mile. Pays
Turning to the leakage at headquarters,
the witness described the negotiations of a
Major Lauth with Bpy Richard Cuers ot I
Has],, showing how the spy promised in
fortnation about the leakage, and how
Picquart was Induced to allow Lieutenant
colonel Henry to accompany Major
Lauth to Basle.
Picquart also- described the vag.i- re
plies of Henry when o.uestioned on the
subject of Esterhazy before his departure '
and the futility of the visit to Basi.- be- i
cause of Givers' refusal, when he saw
Henry, to impart the promised Informa
tion. This incident caused the witness to
wonder whether, instead of trying to make
Cuers speak, Henry and Lauth hai not
done everything possible to impose silence :
upon him. Before the Basle incident Col
onel Picquart had decided to sneak to â 
General de Boisdeffre about Esterhazy
"in answer to my request." said the
witness, "General do Boisdeffre wrote me !
asking me to meet him at the train on
his arrival from Vichy. While driving
from the railroad station to the generals !
home I told him all I had done in regard '
to Esterhasy. F affirm that Genera! v iis
deffre knew that this question was to re
main a Secret between us, and that I wma
not to mention it except to the Minister
of War. i knew Esterhazy was anxious :
to enter the War Office, and I did not re
gard his desire favorably. I communi
cated my impressions to my chiefs who
approved all my steps, and the application
of Esterhazy was rejected. His insist
ence, however, only increased my uneasi
ness regarding him. and I resolved to ob
tain a specimen of his handwriting I I
was immediately struck with the similar
ity of his handwriting and that of the i
bordereau, and forthwith I had the letters!
of Esterhaxy which were in my possession :
photographed, and showed the photo
graphs to Major I Â» â¢ i Paty de Clam and M
Bertillon <th<> handwriting expert), be-'
tween August S ami September '>."
The colonel emphasized this point, be- j
cause M. Bertillon affirms he saw the pho- !
tographs in May, ISW. and made a note :
of thrm, whereas the letters were not!
written on that date. The conflicting tes- j
timony of Picquart and Bertillon on this '
point has been used to discredit the form
er's evidence.
Colonei Picquart. continuing, said De
Clam, on seeing the writing, forthwith
declared It was that of Matthew Dreyfus
the brother of Captain Dreyfus.
The witness, continuing, said: "You
know h< maintained that 'the bordereau
's the joint work of Alfred and Matthew !
Dreyfus.* M. Bertillon said. 'Thar is the
writing of the bordereau." M. Bertillon
tried to .ifs'-over where I had obtained
the handwriting, luit the only information
I Imparted was that It was current and j
recent handwriting. M. Bertillon then i
sugg 'Sted that it was a tracing and end- I
ed by saying that If it was current hand- |
writing it could only have emanate,] from |
some ore whom the Jews had been exer- ;
cising foi a year in imitating the hand- j
writing of the bordereau.
"At Id. B> rtUlon'a request I left the
photographs with him, When he returned
them he said he had adhered to his opin
lon and earnestly asked to see the oiig- |
leal. AVben I saw beyond a doubt that
the handwriting of the bordereau was Es
terhazy's and seeing that documents men
tioned therein might have been supplied i
by Esterhazy, that the words '1 am going
to the maneuvers' could perfectly well an- i
ply to Esterhazy. and that Esterhazy had I
secret advices at his disposal to copy a
document so voluminous as the 'liring
manual.' I resolved to consult the secret
dossier to see what part of the. treachery
might be ascribed to Dreyfus and to as

THE SAN FTCANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 1899.
PROGRESS OF THE SHERMAN'S
VOYAGE TOWARD THIS PORT
ON August 12 The Call said: "In making San Francisco from Yokohama the Knited States transport Sherman,
with the California boys aboard, will probably cover 4650 knots?. Each day she will log from 290 to 300 knots!
and If she does the soldiers should be off the Farallones the afternoon of the 24th or early on the 25th."' Since '
then the transport Warren has arrived with the news that the Sherman is probably following the course selected
by The Call, and Captain Hart says he thinks she will get here within the hours specified. The Sherman has
better steaming coal than was figured on, and that may make a few hours' difference in her actual time; still the
chances are that in no event will she be off the Farallones before noon of the 24th.
Nautical Expert J. T. McMillan figures that at noon yesterday (San Francisco time) the Sherman was about in
latitude 41 domes north, longitude 162 degrees 30 minutes west, and was therefore a little over 1800 nautical miles
from San Fran<
On account of the crowds that assemble in front of the window on the Market-street side of the business office
of The Call it is almost Impossible nowadays for pedestrians to pass by. A large fac simile of the map shown above
is the drawing card, and the attention it attracts indicates the great interest taken by San Franciscans in the
course of the good ship that is bringing the valiant California boys nearer home day by day. At night the crowds
are even' bit as big.

the next day I explained the whole situa

At that time Esterhazj was at the great

ing Dreyfus by a man of straw and the
discovery of the forged VVeyler letter,
supposed to be connected with the same

not showing any disposition to suspend
ission of the court in order to give
him need< d rest.
The witness thÂ«n turned his attention
to the newspaper attacks on Dreyfus,
saying that the Information regarding the
bordereau contained In them convinced
him that ii had been Inspected by some
losely connected with the Dreyfus
'"â¢â¢They could not," he added, "be attrib

he asked permission to inquire Into the
sources of the articles, but war, forbidden
to Inter, ft" in any way whatever.
â Describing his interview v.lth General
; . September 1, Picquart said: "When
I asked General Gonse for permission to
continue the Investigation, insisting on
the danger of allowing the Dreyfus family
to proceed with the investigation alone,
the general replied that it was Impossible
in his opinion and in the opinion ol Gen
eral Boisedeffre and the Minister of war
to reopen the affair. When I pressed on
the point, in order to make General Cons.
understand that nothing could prevent its

was Innocent, General Gonse replied: 'If
you say nothing nobody will know.'
" 'General.' 1 replied, "what you tell me
is abominable. I do not know what I shall
do I.ut I won't carry this secret with me.'
(Great sensation.) 1 at once left the
room." â¢ . ,
"That is what occurred. I know my ac
count is disputed, but 1 positively swear
it â â  said I** quart as he emphatically
smote the bar in front of the witness box
and looked In t ho direction of the gen
ei als.
The col in ! next described his inten
tions with regard to Esterhazy, which
Generals Gonse and I>e Boisdeffre had
forbidden him to cany out. He attached
particular importance to this point, as il
contained a clew to subsequent occur
rences. I-ater witness said thaj while De
Clara evidently acted wrongly ln\dis
guising himself with a false beard and
Blue Bpectacles, perhaps he was author
ized to do so.
After a few minutes' suspension of the
session Colonel Picquart resumed his dep
osition, snowing how. through an article
in the Eclair. Beptembi r 15, he was satis
lied Esterhazj' had been warned of the
suspicions against him.
In order to make the proofs complete
witness continued his investigations with
the utmost discretion. In his opinion the
only event of Importance in the Dreyfus
affair since the discovery of the bordereau
was the Henry forgery, perperated Octo
ber 31, IS&6. He added that it must have
be< n handed immediately to General
Gonse. Shortly before Henry perpetrated
the forgery an agent named (In. nee.
Henry's right-hand man, prepared a re
pori declaring that c'astelln. Republican
Revisionist Deputy for Laon Division of
Aisne, was about to play the hand of the
Dreyfus family by unmasking in the
Chamber of Deputies the prisoner's ac
complices, thus having the affair re
opened. Colonel Picquart incidentally
complained bitterly that while he ,vns
still chief of the Intelligence Department
Henry's tool, Guenee, should be allowed
to make reports against the witness, who
had then established a connection between
the reports of Guenee, the false deposition
of Henry, who had testified that he bad
seen the witness seated in Maitre L^biois"
office with the document containing- the
words "Cette canaille de D â -."Each
new scheme was a development of the one
preceding.
The next feature of Piequart's deposi
tion was his recital of the Intrigues
against him and the pressure exercised
by Henry, with the view of fixing on the
witness the blame, for communicating in
formation to the newspapers. ThÂ«n, turn
ing to the commission on which he was
dispatched. Picquart described th-" 1 irrita
tion he felt when h" saw he was being
removed because he was no longer wanted
as h^ad of the intelligence department.
He explained that if this disgrace had
been frankly avowed it would have been
much less painful to' him. The colonel
also said that during hit absence his cor
respondence was tampered with.
Dealing with his mission in Tunis?, which
Picquart said might to have been intrust
ed to n commissary of police, the witness
declared It was then that Henry, abandon
ing his underhand intrigues, began a
campaign of open persecution. Henry
wrote to the witness, accusing him of
communicating information to the press,
with disclosing the contents of secret doc
uments and with attempting to suborn of
ficers in connection with the petit btetl
It was then Picquart learned of the ex
isteKce of the forged secret documents di
rected against himself, and foresaw his
own ruin if the Dreyfus affair was re
opened, and to safeguard himself he In
trusted to a lawyer friend a certain letter
from General Gonse, at the same time ac
quainting the lawyer with what he knew
of Esterhazy and instructing the lawyer
how he should intervene if the occasion
demanded it. This lawyer, M. de Blois
communicated with M. Scheurer-Kestner, i
then one of the Vice Presidents of the
Senate, and the representations of the lat
ter to Premier Meline's government fol
lowed.
Wh*>n Picquart's furlough was duo Gen
eral Leclerc, cummaiiiiing in Tunis, was
ordered to send Picquart to the frontier
lof Tripoli. Leclerc commented to the wit
i ness oh thjs abnormal order, and Picquart
! confided to the general the probable rea
i sons for it and his belief In the inno
cence <>f Dreyfus. Leclerc thereupon or
; dered Picquart not to go beyond Gabies.
: In the meanwhile the campaign in Paris
! was continued. ost< rhaxy appeared
among the witnesses and accusers.
Picquart here created a sensation by
incidentally remarking tnat the Judges
in 1894 were shamefully deceived in hav
ing: the document containing the words
"Cette canaille de I> " conveyed to
them. Witness bitterly recited the details
of the various machinations with the view
of incriminating him Instigated by Henry,
Esterhazy and Dv Pats de clam.
Colonel Jouaust, president of the court,
having asked for explanations on certain
points. Picquart said:
"If I t( 11 you 'ill this, gentlemen, it is
to show what must have been the mental
attitude toward me of the members of
the court-martial which tried ICsierhuzy."
i Murmurs of assent.)
When he resumed his deposition the wlt
-11. ss siiid he regretted he hnd not been
given th- opportunity to contradict his
accusers at that court-martial.
"I nave almost finished my task,"'
added Picquart, "but I ask permission
i.. refer to the way the bordereau came
to th- War Office. " I have doubts In re
gard to the person who brought the
bordereau. Two quite different persons
could certainly have delivered the borde
reau in l^iM. Hut if an intelligent person
had delivered it he would certainly have
insisted upon the value of its contents."
General Roget and General Mercier,
Saving intimated a desire to speak. Colo
nel Jouaust asked Dreyfus if he had any
thing tn say, and the prisoner replied in
the negative.
General Roget then mounted the plat
form and asked (.'oioncl Picquart for ex
planations regarding the Quenelli. affair.
'â¢Colonel Piequrirt ." said General Roget,
i "attacked me this morning In regard to
m> speech for the prosecution of the
Qu< nelli (use. He said he was not pres
ent a 1 the -Ministry of War when the
Case was in progress. That Is quite In
correct. I ask colonel Picquart if he de
nies that he wrote Captain Marechal an
order to connect him with Galanti; that
he wrote to the Public Prosecutor enclos
ing documents, and that he wrote to the
Public Prosecutor a second time? If hf
denies this. I ask the court to send for
Marechal and the dossier in the Quenelli
affair."
Colonel Picquart replied that there was
no need to threaten to produce the dos
sier in order to make him reply.
"1 did nol say." he declared, "I was
absent during the Quenelli affair. I said
1 was absent part of the time and that
painful duties did not permit me to par
i ticipate in It. as I would otherwise have
â  don< "
"I>id you write those letters?" asked
Colonel Jouaust.
"Yes." replied Picquart, "I remember
writing letters in the case, though I do
not remember exactly their terms or
date.s."
Colonel Jouaust then said: "General
Roget asks if you deny you wrote a let
ter Bending Galanti to Switzerland?"
"Galanti," the witness replied, "was
an agent who gave us information about
the Italian forts In the neighborhood of
Bell fort. Finding ourselves on the point
of being discovered, we very naturally
took measures to avoid it. That Is why
i Galanti was sent to Switzerland."
"Then you wrote the letters," said Gen
eral Koget, "and 1 add that Colonel
Henry was not concerned in this affair.
He was sent to }?el!fort against his wilt
by Colonel Picquart."
The witness acknowledged writing some
letters and wanted to know their text.
He said he would like to see them so that
he could he more precise.
"You must have Been." he said, "hovt
much falsehood there has been in this
affair "
In reply to further questions Picquart
admitted sending documents to Bellfort
for use in the Quenelli case; "hut." he
added, 'they were handed to the public
prosecutor."
General Rogers questioning was evi
dently with the view of eliciting the con
fession from Colonel Picquart that in the
Quenelli case he communicated to the
j Judges documents unknown to the de
; fense, as he now accuses the general staff
of doing in the Dreyfus case. The general
concluded with angrily repelling various
statements of Picquart In regard to his
connection with the press, and a dialogue,
apparently wholly unconnected with the
present trial, followed.
General Mercier promptly replaced Gen
eral Roget.
"Colonel Picquart," Mercier said, "has
stated that I ordered him to convey docu
| ments to Colonel Mmirel. That is false.
I never hnnded any packet to. Colonel
Picquarr for Colonel Maurel. I never
mentioned secret documents to him."
Tn reply Colonel Picquart said: "I re
; rrlember perfectly handing a packet to
Colonel Maurel."
General Mercier next denied Colonel
Picquart's statement relative to the meet
ing with General Gotrse during the after
noon of January 6. 1SP"Â». when the latter
was greatly excited at the prospect of
war.
"That cannot be the case," said General
â  Mercier. "Gonse will make a deposition
on the subject. I don't know what he
will say. But he could not have been ap
i prehensive of war that afternoon, since I,
' myself, had no apprehensions on that
! score."
Colinel Picquart replied that he ad
hered to everything he had said. General
| Gonse. witness explained, was excited be
cause he knew of the action of an Em
bassadoi toward M. Caslmir-Perier, then
President of the republic.
General Mercie.r next referred to Pic
quarfs statement that the Avignon
document was communicated to the
i court-martial of 1804. He said:
"I deny it positively. The only- docu
ments communicated were the Panlz
' znrdi telrpram. De Clam's commentary,
the note of the Italian attache In regard
to the French railroads and the report of
Guence."
Colonel Picquart here pointed out that
he had only expressed his belief on this
subject.
General Mercier further thought it in
cumbent upon him to reply to the allega
tion of Colonel Picquart regarding the re
sponsibility of De Clam relative to the
communication to a foreign power of a
note c'c-aJing with modifications in the ar
tillery.
This note is said to have been prepared
in General Mercler's department. I de

that the document was drawn up iiot by
Dv Paty de clam, but by Colonel Mafcson.
in another department, though the record
of it ha> disappeared.*'
In regard to the bordereau General
Mercier reaffirmed that it reached the
ministry through the ordinary channels.
Man re Demange at this juncture -com
mented upon the disappearance of De
c lam g commentary, to which General
Mercier answered: "The commentary
was prepared for me."
Counsel, however, insisted that although
it was prepared for Me-rcier the commen
tary was included in the dossier and ought
to be forthcoming.
The court then adjourned for the day.
GUERIN CONTINUES
TO DEFY THE POLICE
PARIS. Aug. IS.â M. Guerin decided to
night to energetically maintain his own
propositions, and refused to accept Chose
proposed by General Jacquey. M.
Guerin's decision not to surrender was
delivered after a deputation of the Na

and informed him of the contents of the
semi-official note.
General Jacquey and M. Kiermen
Faure. Revisionist and anti-Semite dep
uty from Oran, Algeria, had numerous
interviews during the day, and also with
Premier Waldeck-Roiiss>;ui. whereupon
General Jacquey submitted his proposi
tion for surrender.
It is now said that Lasces, anti-Semite I
deputy from the <'ondom district of the
<;ers. has decided to discontinue negotia
tions with M. (luerin. General Jacquey,
who is ;i Republican member of trie
chamber of Deputies, is also discouraged
and has left Paris. A semi-official note
Issued to-night says:
"Having considered for humanity above
all other things, the Government from
the beginning discarded the Idea of
storming M. Guerin's bouse or the seiz
ure of the accused by mere force. Meas
ures for preventing M. Guerin from com- !
municatlng with, the outside world, aa
well as preventing or dispersing all as
semblages, will be maintained, however,
as long as possible."

asked for a razor to shave himself,

tired and worn out. Satisfactory traces
were also found on him at Chateau (Jiron,

dent that he is following the road to
Paris, which is never any great distance
from the railway, where he evidently
hopes to steal s ride or take a ticket oil

will be instantly caught. If he continues
his march in the same direction be must
come out the next day into the open
country, the entrance to which is com
pletely picketed, military and gendarmes

STRUVES REFUSED
TO COMPROMISE
Preliminary Hearing of
Peter Storm.
WAS RELEASED ON BAIL
ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTING TO
MURDER HIS NEPHEW.
The Case Has Stirred Up a Bitter
Family Feud and Trouble Is
Expected When the
Trial Begins.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WATSONVILLE, Aug. 18.â The pre
liminary examination of Peter Storm.
charged with an attempt to murder his
nephew, Lawrence Struves, took place
before Judge Hawkins to-day and
Storm was bound over to appear before
the Superior Court, with bail fixed at
$3000 i He furnished the required bonds,
with George Seitz and Chris Storm as
surety. It was thought for a time that
the Struves would not actively prose
cute Storm, owing to a desire not to
air family troubles in court, but the
efforts put forth to effect a compromise
are at an end and the fight is on to a
finish.
The Struves have retained ex-District
Attorney Lindsay to assist District At
torney Knight in the prosecution, and
Storm has retained for his defense S.
F. Geil of Salinas and Rogers &
Wyckoff of this city.
Owing to the prominence of the
Struves and Storms the trial will at
tract considerable attention, and it
would not surprise any one if further
trouble took place before the case is
heard in the Superior Court.
BURGLARS MAKE A RICH
HAUL IN SAUSALITO
Residence of J. W. Harrison Entered
and Jewelry Carried Away.
SAUSALITO, Aug. IS.â Several bold
and determined attempts at house
breaking have been made here in the
past few days and the town is in a
most excited condition. In one in
stance the thieves secured jewelry and
other valuables estimated to be worth
$2000. The poolrooms are blamed for
the burglaries on account of their pres
ence bringing so many rough and un
ruly characters into the town, and the
antipathy manifested toward the gam
bling, dens by the respectable element
of the community has taken a fresh
lease of life, the probability being that
j a second attempt will be made to have
i the town disincorporated.
Last Wednesday evening J. W. Har
| rison, the San Francisco coal magnate,
â¢ retired with his family about 11 o'clock,
after entertaining a number of guests.
At midnight, while everybody in the
j house was sleeping, burglars effected
|an entrance through a rear window
! and secured a quantity of silver plate
I yalued at $1000. Mrs. and Miss Dickens
i of San Francisco, who were guests of
the family, lost a quantity of valuable
jewelry, including several diamonds.
Among the valuables was a diamond
breastpin valued at $500. The total
value of the booty secured by the ma
rauders aggregated $2000.
On the following evening Arthur Pig
gott of Wildwood Glen, while lying in
bed in the second story of his house,
heard somebody on the lower floor and,
arming himself, proceeded to investi
gate. As he descended the stairway
his coming was heard by the thieves,
two in number, whn dropped a sack in
! which they had placed a quantity of
valuables and fled. Piggott rushed <>ut
into the street and fired at the burglais
as they were fleeing, but is not certain
whether he hit either of them.
On the same night an attempt was
made to effect an entrance into the
i house of Mrs. Tillinghast through th. ;
I front door. The noise of a key turning
j in the lock awakened a member of the
family, who lighted a lamp and started
for the door. As the door opened be
saw one man jumping the fence and
another running down the road.
The services of two San Francisco de
tectives have been secured in an en
deavor to discover the identity of the
thieves who looted the Harrison resi
dence. A close watch Is also being
kept by the local authorities for any
future attempts at burglaries.

TAFF'S LIFE
WASSAVED
His Tonsils Were Inflamed
and Enlarged So That
His Throat Was Com=
pietely Closed.
F. B. Taif Neither Ate Nor
Swallowed for Three Days,
and Death Seemed In-
evitable.
Loit 15 Pounds in Ten Days â Was
Miraculously Cured in Four Days
by Dr. Aborn.
A remarkable cure of quinsy was ef-
fected by Dr. Aborn, the specialist in the
treatment of throat and lung diseases, at
554 Sinter street. The case was that of F.
B. Taff, whose statement is made in the
following sworn affidavit:
F. B. Taff, being duly sworn, deposes
and says:
I was afflicted with a severe case of quin-
sy, to such an extent that my life was
jeopardized, and I lost fteen pounds of
flesh in ten days, and for three days he-
fore applying to Dr. Aborn I could neither
eat, drink nor swallow.
The inflammation was so great that I
suffered the most excruciating pain in my
throat, ears and head.
I was at Pendleton, Or., at the time, and
!at once sought the best medical aid I
could obtain there, but I continually grew
worse instead of better under the treat-
ment, and as it was a matter of life and
death in a short time I immediately took
the train to consult Dr. Aborn. who I
heard was the most successful physician
in the United States for the treatment of
such troubles.
I went direct to Dr. Aborn's office. Al-
though scarcely able to speak above a
whisper I explained to the doctor how I
was afflicted, and upon examination of my
throat he pronounced it "Quinsy In the-
most aggravated form," both tonsils be-
ing so inflamed and swollen . that my
throat was completely closed up, so. that
I could neither eat nor swallow. The doc-
tor said, notwithstanding my dangerous
condition, that lie could relieve me in
forty-eight hours, and I at once submitted
myself to his treatment, and without cut-
ting, scarifying; cauterizing or burning he
gave me instant relief, as though by mag-
ic, and in forty-eight hours 1 was so com-
pletely cured that I could eat, drink and
breathe as well as I ever could, and now,
this being the fourth day, 1 am completely
cured without being subjected to any
harsh or painful treatment whatever, and
with a cheerful and grateful heart I take
pleasure in commending Dr. Aborn to the
public as a most successful and skillful
physician, for without his services I am
satisfied that I could not have lived an-
other forty-eight hours. F. B. TAFF.

SENDS AN APPEAL
TO GOVERNOR GAGE
Dissatisfied With, the White=
washing Given McNaughton
by the Trustees.
BAN JOSE, Aug. IS.â alumni in- |
vestigating committee of the State Nor
mal School is not satisfied with the
"white washing" given Principal Me-
Naughton. charged with immorality,
lncompetency and lack of integrity, and
have appealed to Governor Gage to step i
in ax.d intercede and save the school.
It is claimed the school has been :
.greatly injured by placing a man of
McNaughton's character at its head j
It Is reared now that many pupils will
leave the school and go to the other
r.ormal institutions because of the no
toriety given the local school. The citi
zens of this city also propose to take
up the matter and several strong pe
titions will be sent to the Governor.
The Board of Trustees has been se
verely condemned tor their action in
finding McNaughton not guilty. Trus
tee Short of Fresno prepanJ the reso
lutions that whitewashed McNaughton
and it is claimed they we â¢ written be
fore the Investigation b- -fan.
McNaughton is loth to give up his
position without a hard fight, and has
consulted an attorney about suing for
a full 'years salary â ' dismissed.
The alumni committee, consisting of
J G. Jury. Eli Wright and F. E. Carll.
has prepared the following appeal to '
Governor Gage, which, with a portion
of the evidence taken, has been for
â warded to Sacramento:

S
held en July 17. July 31 and August 1 of
this year. and petition your Exceilency4to
take" such a course in reference to the
matter as we aeem the exigencies of the
occasion require. . â 
We present herewith sufficient or jtne
testimony adduced at the hearing* before
the board to establish the necessity for
intervention upon your part, for it ha? a.
ways been and it still is our conviction
That the controversy in which Professor
McNaughton has been involved for t.-.e
i>a>t ten years, aside from the questions
of his guilt or innocence, is alone suffi
cient to disqualify him for the nigh omce
cf principal of one of our Normal Scnools.
Wo are sorry that the Board of Trustee?
of the Norn ii School saw lit to evade the
real issue by constituting Itself a tribunal
of judees to inquire into and decide upon
the truth or falsity of the Council Bluffs
charges rather than determine the more
vital questions centering about the wel
fare of the Normal Schoui and the de
mands of the people <>t me State for a
man above all reproach, cf unimpeaehed
inttgritv and of unquestioned scholarship.
Over "and over again we stated to the !
board that in our judgment the truth or
falsitj of the Council Bluffs chareos
could rot be determined at such a great
distance lv time and space from the scene
of events; that many of "the witnesses
were dead, others had moved away and
others may have during the last of the
years forgotten many of the happenings
in Council Bluffs surrounding the resig
nation of Professor McNaughton after '
the charges had en tiled against him
â¢with the School Board of that city. We
insisted, on the other hand, that Professor
McNaughton's flight from Council l .luft' >
without demanding any Investigation of
the charges before a proper tribunal
should not be taken as a roof of his In
nocence. . but rather that his retreat
Fhoulfi at least be considered as casting
h doubt over the career of Professor Mc-
Xaughton iiled In that city sufficient to
warrant the Board of Trustees of a State
institution in ' fusing to keep such a man
in a high and responsible position In an
important educational institution.
Why should the State of California
rake up the fight of this man. who in
1890 capitulated like a craven before what
h<? says was an unsubstantial foe? There
are many educators whose , cognized
learning, ability â  :â " character would
lend grr-atness- and stiitgth to the school,
.nil upon onÂ» of these we think should
fall the mantle which has been so worth
ily worn heretofore. We do not say, not
withstanding the effort of the Board of
Trustees to place â¢ in that attitude.
That the Council Bluffs charges are true.
Nor do Tre say they are false. But we
do say that the. State and thÂ»- Normal
School should be relieved It m the neces
sity of mixing up in Professor McNaugh
ton'p scandals.
We submit that the following conclu
sions as stated In our first report to the
Board nf Trustees are fairly, if not ir
refutably deduclble from the "vast amount
of testimony reviewed in the matter.
Firstâ When Dr. ' ' ! ighton was City
Superintendent of Schools at Council
Bluffs; Iowa; the charges referred to
herein were made against him by eight
reputable citizens of Council Bluffs, tiled
with the, School Board and spread upon
The minutes, of such board as a perma
nent record.
Secondâ Said charges have never been
Investigated by any competent tribunal
or court. ; .>.*.â¢â â <.'-
Thirdâ We deem It impossible at this
late date and at surh a distance from
rouncll Bluffs to absolutely determine
the truth or falsity of such charges.
Fourthâ We . consider that Professor
MrNaughton was relict in not demand-
Ing a full investigation of the charges
made against him before some board or
competent tribunal in Council Bluffs, and
nt a time when the controversy arose or
within a reasonable time <-rr-after.
Fifthâ Whether or not Mr. McNaugh
ton is guilty of these charges, the fact
prill remains that he resigned his posi
tion in the far" of them; that although
his accusers were wealthy men. he never
brought suit against any of them for
damages or took any other active steps
to secure a retraction of the same.

Sixthâ many reputable citizens of

charges are true ana that the position
assumed by them is in direct and irre

Seventhâ That this controversy concern-
Ing the character and competency of Pro
fessor McNaughton cannot fall but be
detrimental to the welfare of the Normal
School of San Jose should Professor Mc-
Naughton remain In charge.
Eighthâ That Professor McNaughton
should have advised the Board of Trus

reason that it is evident that charges of
such a nature are not to be lighuy treat
ed or contemptuously waved aside when
the selection of the principal of a State
Normal School is being made.
â That the reason for the dismissal
of Professor McNaughton from the super
inter.Jer.cy of schools at Council Bluffs
rested in the fact that the charges here
inbefore set forth were made against him.
It Is hardly necessary to enumerate the
charges made by the citizens of Council
Blufts against Professor McNaughton. It
is sufficient for the purpose of this appeal
to merely mention that the records of the
school board at Council Bluffs â certified
copy of which we have and which will
be forwarded to you if you request the
samÂ« â speak not only of ineompetency as
a teacher and dereliction of duty; not
only of practices constituting violation of
the laws cf the State of lowa, but of what
would be far more serious and unendur
able in a Normal School principalâ gross
immorality as a man. In the language
of one of San Jose's best known and most
substantial citizens, contained in a letter
recently sent to a Council Bluffs firm
which was soliciting- testimonials li be
half of Professor McNaughton from every
imaginable source: "If Professor M.'-
Naughton did not realize that such
charges were serious he Is an ignoramus,
and if he did realize their seriousness and
failed to demand an investigation but on
the contrary . â¢ created from them, he is
a moral coward either of which would
disqualify him from being a principal of
a Normal School."
We have acted and are continuing to :
act on the assumption that a man who
would be driven from a city or compelled
to resign a high position rough false ac
cusations is too utterly small to occupy
the position of principal of a normal
school with either credit to himself or to
the school.
There is another and far different phase
of the controversy concerning Professor
McNaughton to which we now desire to
direct your attention. We have said re
specting the Council Bluffs matter that
the mere existence of the charges against
Professor Mi Naughton, and their earnest
and solemn reiteration in letters and in
affidavits to the present day, affords suf
ticient reason to demand his release. Yet
from Tempe, Ariz., a ear and unmis
takable note of warning Is sounded. The
Arizona career of Professor McNaughton,
we tend, proves conclusively to any
one not prejudged in his favor that the
trustees have made a eat mistake in
placing him at the head of the Normal
School.
On one side of the controversy letters
and affidavits were introduced before the
board containing specinc statements of
witnesses as to questions under review,
On the other hand, testimonials of good
character from ministers and others were
presented in Professor McNaughton's be
half. Testimonials in general vouching
for the good character and scholarship of
a person must give way in value and im
portance as evidence of a person's qual;
llcations and character when met by spe
citic definite statements of definite trans
actions and events, and based upon In
dividual knowledge. For instance, when
on one hand a minister of the gospel and
a few citizens of Tempe, Ariz., write In a
general way that Professor McNaughton
is an honorable, scholarly and Christian
gentleman and a good disciplinarian
as a teacher, and on the other
hand letters from his former pu
pils and associate teachers and a
number of citizens enumerate specinc in
stances showing that "open rebellion ex
isted in the Normal School at Tempe dur
ing the past year"; that "Professor Mc-
Naughton intercepted letters that were
directed to J. W. Steltzriede, one of the
pupils of the school"; "that one J. W.
Garnett Holmes was expelled three days
before graduation without parent or
justifiable cause"; "that Professor Mc-
ighton used his authority to compel
the pupils in his school to sign a petition
vouching for hi? (Professor McNaugh
ton's) good character when the Council
Bluffs charges became known in Tempe."
and "that he demanded from those pu
pils who had manhood or womanhood
enough to refuse to sign the reasons for
their course"; "that he was influenced by
considerations of wealth and position In
dealing with his pupils, being partial to
those whose parents could aid him in
his political schemes"; "that he
threatened to discipline some and
bluff or cajole others into sign
ing the petition circulated in his
own school In hie own behalf"; "th I he
used disrespectful language in speaking
of his associate teachers"; "that he used
profane language on one occasion in
speaking of a pupil whose dismissal from
the school he had secured": that he was
"untruthful," "partial in his dealings"
with pupils, and "dishonest." When pu
pils writing at different times and from
different places in this manner of their
observations in the Tempe Normal School
while the same was under the charge of
Professor McNaughton, we certainly
ought to pause in our course and inquire
if California can afford to carry such a
man.
These letters from Arizona bear the
stamp of truth. Young men and young
women are not generally in the business
of libeling worthy teachers. What for*
m*Â»r student under Professor Allen, Pro
fessor Childs or Professor Randall, or
what university student under Dr. Jor
dan or Professor Kellogg would for an
instant contemplate writing anything
detrimental to the character or compe
tency of these men and purposely spread
: the fame broadcast to the world? So far
as the career of Dr. McNaughton in .Ari
zona Is concerned we have no hesitancy
In saying that the proofâ the only com
petent proofâ is overwhelming that he is
! a failure as a teacher and disciplinarian
Inasmuch as he did not possess the trust
! and confidence of pupils which a good
; teacher always commands; that he was
: constantly embroiled in disputes with
teachers, students and citizens; that, in
i short, his career has resembled that of
! the politician filled with stormy and In
cessant controversies rather than that of
the scholar, contemplative, serene anu at
peace with his fellow men.
We therefore, in the name of the
Alumni Association of the Normal School
of San Jose, most earnestly petition your
Excellency to intervene in said matter
, In a manner which to you might seem
I most efficient, and trusting: that the re
. sult will be the selection of another per-
I son in the place of Professor McNaugh
! ton as principal of the school. Such Is
our appeal In behalf of the school whose
j destinies have been intrusted to your
i keeping. Very respectfully yours.

GENERAL JIMINEZ IS
ARRESTED AT CIENFUEGOS
Aspirant for the Presidency of Santo Domingo
Prevented by United States Officers
From Leaving Cuba.
HAVANA, Aug. 18.â In view of the
fact that Colonel Bacallao, chief
of the secret police, persisted to
his declaration that General
Jiminez, the aspirant to the
Presidency of San Domingo, was in
Havana, either not having left or hav
ing returned, the military authorities
telegraphed to Cienfuegoa instructing
Captain Stamper, Collector of Customs
there, to ascertain whether Jiminez was
on the Menondez steamer and to take
him under arrest if that should be the
case. Just as the steamer was about
leaving Cienfuegos Captain Stamper lo
cated Jiminez and arrested him. Jimi
nez denounced the arrest as an outrage.
lit said he had broken no law and
would not yield except by force. Cap
tain Stamper replied that he was ready
to use force if necessary, and Jiminez
then yielded, remarking that he did so
only because he could not help himself.
Senor Frias, Mayor of Cienfuegos, re
fused to make the arrest, claiming that
General Jiminez was an old personal
friend whom h** had known intimately
for years. When Jiminez was taken
into custody Senor Frias was found
with a police inspector in close conver
sation with Jiminez and the latter's
tary. It is believed the Mayor was
urging him to leave the steamer, to
conceal himself and to wait for a better
opportunity.
Captain Btamper informed Jiminez
that he would make him as comfortable
RELIEF FOR THE
STORM-SUFFERERS
Food Being- Distributed
in Porto Rico.
OFFICIAL LIST OF DEAD
DANGER OF AN" EPIDEMIC WAS
OVERRATED.
Captain Wheeler Has Decided to Fur
nish Employment to Men In
stead of Doling Out
Alms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 18.â have
just completed a trip through the
southern and most distressed districts
of the island. The misery is very great
and is more apparent now than it was
immediately after the storm, but the
Government has the famine districts
well in hand and has shown itself com.
petent to deal with the situation.
Relief is being rapidly and effectively
distributed. Each post commander has
received $1000 and limited supplies of
food for distribution. More supplies are
being forwarded as fast as possible.
Each commander has appointed a dis
trict officer, who dispenses food and
money or gives employment.
Mayors of towns receive no money or
supplies, but with scarcely an excep
tion they have rendered valuable as
sistance. Besides a loss of crops the
loss of life has been extremely heavy.
Coming from almost every by road pa
thetically humble funeral processions
are met, the bodies being wrapped in
palm leaves. The majority of the dead
were washed away. The Aibonito dis
trict has suffered severely.
The official figures given by the al
calde are: Killed by the storm, 20;
wounded, 60; houses. destroyed in town
and country surrounding, 1225. The
barracks in Aibonito were totally de
stroyed. Many soldiers had a narrow
escape. One was killed and several
were wounded and one is still missing.
Captain "Wheeler has demonstrated the
advantage of giving work to the suffer
ers instead of doles. On his own au
thority he has spent a portion of the
thousand dollars granted him in em
ploying all available labor. As a re
sult Aibonito to-day is well repaired,
the streets are clean and the people are
contented.
In the country district of Juandlaz.
says the Mayor of that town. 103 per
sons were killed in the storm and many
are ill. The result is much misery.
Provisions are scarce.
In all the country districts reports of
danger from infectious disease have
been exaggerated. The only danger is
from fevers arising from hunger.
In Ponce there may be some infec
tion, but even here the authorities may
be able to keep disease under control if
It breaks out. Army surgeous in all
town are visiting, the Invalids daily.
In all the districts in the island ex
treme poverty is likely to continue for
at least two years.
The whole of Ponce Valley from
Juanadiaz down is a complete ruin.
Trees, houses, piles of river sand,
bodies of cattle and general debris are
scattered everywhere. The highway
cannot be picked out in the midst of
the wreckage and traveling is danger
ous even yet.
In Ponce repairs are being pushed
rapidly. The streets are being cleaned,
but the carts available are not suffi
cient to remove with speed the offen
sive matter deposited by the flood.
Local stores are resuming business.
Telegraphic communication has not yet
been re-established, with San Juan.

SUPPLIES SENT TO
THE DESTITUTE
NEW YORK, Aug. IS.â Relief for the

', largely of clothing and medicines.
REPORTS THAT ANDREWS
ISLAND WAS SWEPT AWAY
JACKSONVILLE, Aug. IS.â According
to a Miami dispatch to the Times-Union
and Citizen, Captain Dinon of the steamer
Cocoa slates that the town of Red Bay,
on the Island of Andrews, twenty miles
southwest of Nassau, was swept away
In the recent tropical hurricane and about
300 lives lost. An eye-witness of the storm
estimated that the loss of life on the
, island waa fully 600. Scattered through
j as possible, and after Jiminez and his
secretary had packed their trunks they
were driven, accompanied by the chief
of police and Captain Stamper, to the
; Union Hotel, where two bedrooms and
! a dining-room were placed at their dis
i posal. General Jiminez will be kept
j under police charge until further
j advices are received from the Governor
! General. There is much excitement
â¢ among the people of Cienfuegos over
i the affair.
The sentiment is generally expressed
that the authorities had no right to ar
rest Jiminez, an unarmed citizen, going
: apparently to Santiago de Cuba, and
the point is even made that even if he
| were going to San Domingo he would
j only be returning to his native coijntry.
Senor Aybor, a representative of Jimi
' nez, left Cienfuegos for Santiago last
; Tuesday after remaining at the former
', place ten days. It is beliveed he tried
!to fit out an expedition, as a small
; schooner was found lying outside the
; harbor, supposed to be awaiting a car
i go of ammunition. Aybor had taken out
â¢ clearance papers for Key West several
! days before.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Aug. 18.â The
; San Domingo agents are rapidly re
cruiting expeditions in this part of the
island, particularly on the north coast.
. f'rders were received from Havana to
day to hold the men recently captured
j at Baracoa pending an investigation.
All trading schooners are closely
! watched. Yesterday the tug Adonis
] was armed and sent to Guantanamo to
! patrol the coast. It is certain that sev
i eral expeditions have been able to get
! away without interference, but General
the wreck of houses at Red Bay after!
the storm subside d. he said, were hun- |
dreds of corpses of persons of all ages
and classes. Captain Diilon says the wind
blew at the r.i r - '. ninety miles an hour
at Nassau, with an occ;>si'onal gust which
reached a velocity of 106 miles an hour.
PROTECTING GAME
IN MARIN COUNTY
John Smith Arrested on a Charge of
Killing Deer Out of
Season.
PAN RAFAEL. Aug. lÂ«._The Maria
County Fish and Game Protective As
king an active crusade
against violators of the fish and g-ame j
laws and its existence is felt as a strong '
factor in the work of apprehending and
punishing those who are regarded as
to blame for the wanton slaying of deer
and quails. J. Burnell was fined $25
last evening by Justice Rodden for hav
ing a number of quails in his possession
out of season and to-day John Smith
was arrested by Constable W. J. Trea
nor on a charge of selling deor meat.
Smith is the man alleged to have sold
the carcass of a deer to Messrs. Phelps
and Black, two San Francisco Super
visors. They took the meat to a res
taurant and left it there for their own
use. It seems, however, that the res
taurateur was prevailed upon to sell
some of the meat to Fish and Game
Commissioner Vogelsang, with the re- I
suit that he was placed under arrest.
As soon as th>j local authorities
learned of this they went to work to
! find out who sold Phelps and Black the
: meat, and now claim to have evidence
tffat Smith is the man. When an
i to-day he claimed, according to th"
j officers, to have given the carcass of
the deer to the Supervisors.
Smith is y inclined to treat the matter
as a Joke, and when questioned after
his arr.-st jocularly remarked, "I am
Innocent. I haven't seen a deer this
season." The authorities say they their
evidence is positive and that Smith will
have to pay a fine.

WASHINGTON. Aug. IS.â lt devel
oped to-day that the orders given to the
gunboat Machias, directing her to pro
ceed to Santiago de Cuba and then
cruise along the north coast of Cuba
in the vicinity of Baracoa, were sent
at the request of the War Department,
which has telegraphic information of a
large filibustering expedition whose
destination is San Domingo. There
is a dlsnosition to believe that It is thiÂ«
expedition which Jiminez hoped to take
to San Domingo.
General Brooke and Commander Lo
gan have been advised that the neu
trality laws of the United States must
I be observed, and there is no intention
' on the part of this Govern
ment of permitting San Domin
, go to again infer that the
\ Tnited States winked its eye at
filibustering expeditions, as appeared to
: be the case when the Fanita was used
j by Jiminez in his expedition of a year
i or so ago.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug. 18.âAd

j eminent there is growing desperate,
apprehensive of the arrival of Jiminez,
leader of the revolution, who is momen
tarily expected. His arrival, it was
added, will completely turn popular
â¢ opinion, w*hich has been partly unde
cided. Consequently the chief object of
the Government is to intercept Jiminez,
! and a number of armed vessels are pa
: trolling the coast with orders to search
j every strange vessel and capture Jimi

AN IDAHO TOWN
LAID IS RUINS
Placerville Swept Out of
Existence.
HUNDREDS ARE HOMELESS
BLAZE STARTED BY THE OVER
TURNING OF A LAMP.
Loads of Previsions and Tents Sent
to Sufferers From
Boise and Idaho
City.
.Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE. Idaho, Aug. 18.â A special
from Idaho City says: Placerville,
Idaho, is in ruins to-nlgrht. A fire
started at about 7 o'clock this evening
in the Veasey Hall from an overturned
lamp. For over four hours the fire
raged furiously and the flames at this
hour (11:30) are still dancing like spec
ters over the embers, lighting up spas
modically the awful gloom through
which peer dozens of homeless and
heart-sick people. With the exception
<>f a few residences the town is wiped
out.
The business portion is completely
destroyed, together with a number of
residences in the main portion of the
town. It is impossible to secure all the
details to-night, as the telephone wires
are down. All the information has come
from Centerville, which is seven miles
west of this place, and about four miles
east of Placerville. The fire originated
in the hall owned by John Yeasey. The
interior of the place was soon ablaze,
and the flames burst through. The
t<uvn had no fire protection, and all the
water that could be secured was from
wells. The hall burned like tinder and
in. a short time the fire had spread to
adjoining buildings.
The rows of wooden buildings fur
nished excellent food for the flames,
while they met with practically no re
sistance. Idaho City has sent three
wagon loads of provisions and clothing
and a dozen wagon loads of tents, pro
visions, etc., have been started from
Boise. Thj loss is estimated all the
way from $300,000 to $500,000. with very
little insurance. Placerville was one of
the oldest towns in the State, having a
population of between 600 and 700. The
town sprang Into existence during the
early placer excitement.
HARQUAHALA MINES
AGAIN CHANGE HANDS
A. D. Hubbard Purchases the Famous
Property and Expects to
Make It Pay.
REDLAN'DS, Aug. 18.â The Harqua
hala mines near Yuraa, Ariz., have
again become the property of A. D.
Hubbard, the millionaire miner of Red
lands. Once before Hubbard owned
these famous mines. One bar shipped
to San Francisco worth $98,000 was the
largest gold bar ever sent from an Ari
zona mine.
In 1593 Hubbard sold the mine for
$1,250,000, the purchasers being an
American corporation organized under
the laws of Minnesota, the majority of
th" stock being owned by English capi
talists. It was officered by high-sal
aried, foreigners, inexperienced in min
ing, and run three years without pay
ing. For three years past it has been
leased and poorly managed. Hubbard
has faith in these mines and is a
shrewd expert mining engineer.
IDENTITY OF A
TRAIN-ROBBER KNOWN
CARLSBAD, N. M., Aug. IS.â lt is now
know nthat the man captured here Tues
day last after a hard fight is one of the
robbers who held up the Colorado and
Southern train near Folsom on July 14.
His name Is McGinnis. He was badiy
wounded in the fight with the posse at
Cimarron and was thought to have been
killed. His partner, who escaped. Is
named Franks. The last report from the
posse pursuing him is that they are close
on his trail about 100 miles northwest of
here. Franks is evidently heading for
Arizona. The men came into Southeast
ern New Mexico to secure horses left at
a ranch by them in May. These horses,
it is alleged, were stolen previously some
wher in Arizona.

OFFICERS FOR THE
NEW REGIMENTS
BEING SELECTED
Secretary Root Plans to Con=Â»
duct the Campaign Vig=
orously.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.â Secretary
Root was busily engaged the greater
part of the day in selecting officers to I
fill the new regiments, going over the \
â¢ lists of names that have been submitted
j with recommendations for appoint
i ments, and considering their efficiency
records during the Spanish war. The
Secretary is giving the matter *of the
' selections special attention and the list
is prepared in his private office. After
the selections are made by the Secre
tary they will be sent to the President
for his approval.
Preparations continue actively in the
matter of arranging for the speedy
transportation of the troops to the
'â  Philippines. The Quartermasters De
i partment has been considering the ad- j
'â¢ viaability of chartering more trans- j
> ports on the Pacific Coast. Already the j
ships chartered make it possible to send
! nearly all the organizations now
j formed by September 25, instead of two
i weeks later, which was the schedule
1 first shown to Secretary Root. The
I transports Logan and Thomas are now
! being fitted up on the Atlantic coast,
! and it is expected they will be ready
to sail by the middle of October and
will take three regiments via the Suez
canal. At the latest calculation it is
now believed to be possible to land all
the new regiments in the Philippines by
I the first of December or very soon after
i that date.
Seven of the lieutenant colonels
i named yesterday are now serving in
; the Philippines. They will remain there
' and await the arrival of their, regi
| ments. While it may not be necessary
to use all the troops in the Philippines,
it is understood to be the plan of Sec
retary Root to have a sufficient force,
not only to defeat the insurgents at:
' every point but to garrison and hold
! the places that may be taken, and thus
insure a safe line of communication.
The map which has been prepared for :
| Secretary Root, showing the location of
the troops in the Philippines, has been
completed, and is also accompanied by
a statement explaining how this force
is divided under the generals com
manding the divisions. The first divis

If any man's health is weakened or
wasted, or running down, he should take
the right means to build himself up strong
and well, so that he can both live and care
for those he loves. He should investigate
the virtues of that great remedy, the
"Golden Medical Discovery'" originated
by Dr. R. V. Pierce, chief consulting phy-
sician of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical
Institute, of Buffalo, N. Y. It is a remedy
that makes a man thoroughly well by giv-
ing power and capacity to the digestive and
assimilative organs. It makes healthy in-
vigorating biood out of the food he eats
It gives him strength and energy to put
into his daily task. It builds up hard mus-
cular flesh and nerve fiber, revitalizes the
tissues of the throat and lungs, heals in-
flammation, purges the blood of bilious
poisons and makes a man, strong, vigorous
and hardy. %
"My husband had been sick a long time,"
writes Mrs. J. W. Brittin, of Clinton, Dewitt Co.,
Ills. (Box 475), " had doctored with home phy-
sicians and even went to Chicago and consulted
a doctor there but without receiving any help.
He went to th* hospital and was operated on
and after three months came home to die (as the
doctors here thought), but after awhile he com-
menced to take your wonderful medicine, the
'Golden Medical Discovery ' and now, thanks to
your most welcome medicine, he can eat any-
thin? he wants and is again a well man."
No remedy relieves constipation so
quickly and effectively as Dr. Pierce'a

CONSUL HO TOW
CREATES MUCH
CONSTERNATION
Gives Voice to Pro-
American Ideas.
DIPLOMATS CRITICIZE HIM
. â Â«. â
THE CHINESE OFFICIAL ISSUES
A STRIKING CIRCULAR.
He Fearlessly Expresses Anti-Euro
pean Sentiments and Makes Sug
gestions to American Capital
ists Regarding His Country.
Ho Tow, the local Chinese Consul Gen
eral, has just Issued a printed appeal to
; American capitalists Imploring them to
organize a gigantic corporation to take
! advantage of the splendid commercial ad
; vantages offered In China, The doevk
â  ment, which Ho Vow now asserts was
not issued by him in an official capacity,
has created considerable comment in
diplomatic circles. In fact, many ex
perienced diplomats go so far as to criti
cize the Chinese Consul for uttering in
his appeal what they term^anti-European
sentiments. The Consul openly refers
them to the friendly feelings his people
hold for the United States, and intimates
that the Government he represents has
little love for the European powers.
The following passages from Ho Vow's
remarkable document serves to Illustrate
the unequivocal pro-American and anti-
European sentiments which the Consul
General has had the courage to express:
European nations have not been slow to
recognize the trade opportunities offered in
China and have Bought to obtain territorial
concessions. The United States Government
has always maintained a passive attitude,
and has, in consequence, a material ad
vantage that other nations lack. One who
follows the daily trend of events and is
conversant with the aggressive and grasp-
Ing policy of Europe can readily realize the
advantages that may accrue to the citi
zens of the United States through the lib
eral non-interference of their Government.
Pushing American industry Is bound to
be felt, he continues, and the new era in
china will meet it more than half way. A
union of forces Is bound to be productive
; of great results. A corporation with the
capital that could be commanded by a
union of interests of magnitude could be
made a veritable Golconda. We can, with.
American energy and push and the friendli
ness of the Chinese Government toward this
country, obtain permanent and financial
advantage.
Hitherto the Chinese doing business at
treaty ports have dealt almost â  entirely
â¢with English and German firms. The feel
ing against these nations at present Is such
that If American capital should now step
In a strong combination could be made in
favor of the proposed company, and Its
agencies could be developed Into a valuable
source of revenue, particularly through the
influence of its Chinese connections.
When Interviewed on the matter, Con
sul General Ho Vow did not attempt to
weaken or qualify the sentiments he so
fearlessly uttered in his appeal. He
stated, however, that he wished It plain
ly understood that he issued the docu
ment as an individual, not as Consul
General of the Chinese Government.
"While I am authorized to use all legit
imate means to promote the welfare of
my country as Consul General of China,'
he said, "and while this circular which
I have written might be construed as an
official declaration, it Is not such. It is
a declaration of my individual sentiments
and ideas, and the Chinese Government
is not responsible for it. My apprecia
tion of the new conditions created by the
United States' recent territorial acces
sions, coupled with a desire to advance
the interests of my own country together
with those of the Pacific Coast, prompted
me to issue the circular. Commercial
and : territorial expansion are parallel
propositions. I have no pecuniary In
terests at stake. If I had I would not
have attempted to suggest the opportun
ities offered in China, .
Ho Vow is a man of fine mental, at
tainments. He speaks the English lan
guage quite fluently and can discourse on
almost any subject. ' '

LEAGUE REPUBLICANS
TO CAUCUS TONIGHT
To Complete Convention Arrangements.
Democratic Candidates Announced.
The Burns Faction Working on the Alameda
Delegation â Extra-Session Talk Among
the Legislators.
THE two hundred delegates of the i
Central Republican League will j
caucus to-night at Golden Gate '
Hall, on Sutter street, between j
Mason and Taylor. The caucus j
: plan was decided upon Thursday night, I
j when the chairmen of the district organt- j
' zations came together at the Grand Hotel
to report to the district committee the
standing and attitude of the delegates in
i their different districts.
Word was brought In while the meeting
was in progress that the County Commit
! tee had set the date for the convention at
; Wednesday next, and the necessity of at
i once lining up the league delegates was
â  immediately perceived. The County Com-
I mlttee had permitted the idea to go forth
that the convention would not be called
at any near-at-hand date, and its sudden
j action in fixing the day at a time when
iit knew many of the league delegates
j would be busy with the reception of the
First California^ called down a good deal
of censure.
The league is not yet ready to proceed i
with its nominations and unless every
| thing can be decided at to-night's caucus
! it is likely that adjournment will be taken
Wednesday as soon as the chairman and
secretary "have been named.
i The Democrats are busier at producing
candidates than at anything else. Sena
tor R. Porter Ashe was announced yester
day as a candidate for the District Attor-
I ney's office and when asked about it last
I night did not deny a willingness to accept
i should the nomination come his way. Eu
gene Deuprey, who was pulled off the
j ticket last year at the last moment, is
also out after the counselor's job and j
i intends making a warm fight, as he j
| claims the nomination on last year's j
; promises. Assemblymen Justus Wardell
i and I. J. Crowley are out for the Audi- |
â  tor's desk, and both men have a host of !
' friends working for them. Neither will i
I admit his candidacy, but confess that
; they may fall before the entreaties of an
| anxious constituency before they are
I through with it.
Michael Finn, some time baseball pro
! moter, has announced his candidacy for
I Recorder and Andrew J. Cleary )s the
latest to be prominently mentioned as
i Democratic choice for County Clerk.
State politics is still bubbling merrily.
I Senator Cutter of Sutter has been a good
; deal in evidence the past week, but his
i interest has not been in local politics. The
i Senator said the other day he had come
i to the city to get his back teeth fixed, but
i his friends and a number of others of
' those who spent their time at the last
session voting for Grant say he came
: down to agree to go into caucus when
! Governor Gage gets the tip from Colonel
I Burns to call the extra session.
! Two other dentist-delighters who got
i into town yesterday were Senator Boyce of
. Santa Barbara and Senator Davis <if Am
j ador. They were in close consultation
during the afternoon with members of the
different factions, but whether as a result
in this round, and in the thirteenth land

that they have enough pledges up their
sleeve to assure th<m of only one result.
Just what the latter claim is based on 13
not apparent. Although It is a fart that
a number of those who hold out at the
last session are now willing to caucus, the
anti-Burns spirit is as strong and even
more evident than it w:is last January.
The Alameda delegation is just now the
object of the Burns crowd's keenest poli
tics. Judge Dibble is managing the cam
paign, and members from the other Fide
of the bay are in town dally and are being 1
put through their catechism in the Crock

of caucus talk Is? being handed out, and
every member who is caught in the drag
net is impressed with the absolute cer
tainty of an extra session, although it is
| said that for reasons of economy it is not
to extend over ten days.
Speaker Anderson, who came down from
Sulsun on Thursday, returned yesterday,
but expects to be down again to remain

that EriearilÂ»r General Hale had during- the campaign in the Philip
pines threatened to prefer charges against General Otis which was
telegrapher broadcast throughout the country, appears to be untrue.
The yarn, which emanated from a letter written by Private Henry
Kerr. who was at one time General Hale's orderly, pictured General Hale's
command in the act of winning a. brilliant decisive victory; when General Otis
ordered him to postpone the attack and march his command to the rear. A
stormy Interview between the two eenerals was aJ4eged to have followed, in
which Hale accused Otis of rank cowardice and threatened to prefer, charges
agrainst him to the Government. : I- V
The matter has caused widespread comment among the members and offi
cers of the Colorado Regiment. They not only deny the story in vehement

'"You can quote me as paying that the story of the alleged friction be
tween General Hale and General Otis is not only utterly ridiculous but ab
solutely untrue." said Captain Brooks, adjutant on General Hale's staff,
when seen yesterday at the regimental encampment at the Presidio. "The
story has not the slightest foundation on truth. At no time during the cam
paign did General Hale retreat from a position which we were about to
capture, and at no me did he threaten General Otis with charges of cow
ardice."'
'The story is false from beginning to end," said Lieutenant Perry, Gen ;
eral Hale'? chief aid. "If anything like that had occurred I would surely
have known it. You may be assured that General Hale never had any
trouble with General Otis on any such proposition."

SECRETARY ROOT APPEALS FOR
SUBSCRIPTIONS.

Mayor Phelan Receives a Letter Set
ting Forth Frightful Condi
tions Around San Juan.
Secretary of War Root has Issued to
every city in the country an appeal for
aid for the I sands of Porto Ricans
who suffered by the tornado of a fortnight
ago. The following: letter was received by
Mayor Phelan yesterday and already $115
has been subscribed:
"War Department, Washington, D c.
August 11. !<>:-?.
To the Mayor cf San Francisco, a i â
Sir: The Governor General of Porto Rico
confirms the report that upon the Bth inst
a hurricane swept over that island, en
tirely demolishing many or the towns, de
stroying many lives, and reducing, so far
as he can estimate, not â¢ --â¢:. one hun
dred thousand (100.000) of the inhabitants to
the condition of absolute destitution without
homes or food. Unless immediate and .ef
fective relief Is given, these unfortunate
people will perish of famine.
Under these conditions, the President
deems that an appeal should he made to the
humanity <>'. the American people. It is an
appeal to tht-ir patriotism also, for the In
habitant* of Porto Rico have freely and
gladly submitted themselves to the guard
ianship of the United States and have
voluntarily surr^mlerr-d the protection of
Spain, to which they were formerly en
titled, confidently relying upon more bene
ficent treatment at our hands. The highest
considerations of honor and good faith unite
with the promptings of humanity to re
quire from the United States a generous
response to the demand of Porto Rican dis
tress.
This department has directed the imme
diate distribution of rations to the sufferers
by the army in Porto Rico, as far as it is
â¢within the power of the executive, but in
the absence of any appropriation we must
rely largely upon private contributions.
I teg that you will call upon the public
rtted and humane people of your cltv to
take active Â»nd immediate measures in "this
exigency. The Government transport Mc-
Ptaeraon will be sent directly from the port
of New York to Porto Rico on Monday, the
lith inst., to carry all supplies of* food
which can be obtained Further transports
will be ?Â»>nt at future dates, of which public
notice will be Riven. .
Any committee charged with the raising
of funds will receive full information and
advice upon communicating with this de
partment. I inclose herewith copies of tele
grams received from General Davis. Very
respectfully,

HONORED DEAD
ARE REMEMBERED
Emperor William Un
veils a Monument.
Special T>;ppat<-h to The Tall.
BERFiIX, Aug. Ivâ Emperor William
unveiled a monument to the dead of the
regiment of the First Guards on the St.
Privat battlefield, in the vicinity of Metz.
In the address, which his Majesty made
on the occasion he said:
"Hallowed recollections attend to-day's
festival, making hearts beat higher. My
First Regiment of Foot Guards is repre
sented by one company, its glorious flags
and many old comrades who fought and
bled on this spot. I unveil this monu
ment in remembrance of fhos>* who fell
or. Hie field o; battle. This ceremony also
ttrkts place in the presence of my young
est regiment and the whole army repre
sented by The troops of the Sixteenth
Cirps. This is almost tht- only r-piment
which has not hitherto been represented
by a monument on this hloou-drenched
field. Yet it had fall claim to one. Al
though it is nearly related by history to
my house, whose princes and kings it has
been <ail^d upon to train up and though i
it might rightly th.-refore be considered j
as a family household regiment, yet my
grandfather did noi hesitate for ;t mo
ment â  sacrif c, to the welfare of the
country, the troopa so dear to him. His
tory tells us how the regiment fought.
bled and fulfilled its â¢ / d how its
behavior evoked the praise and its sor
the tears of the great Emperor.
This regiment, with i: i its si nlor com
rade, to-day s*Â»ts up a memorial of stone
to its heroes who re>- h the sward.
"The design of 'his monum-nt differs
from that usual "n .â¢â â â â  - A maii
clad angel leans in cairn repose on a
sword adorned with ti.f regiment's proua
motto, 'semper talis.' I desire that tne
mraning of this figure he generally
.known. It stands on this field as a guar
dian of all the hrav.- soldiers of both
armies, French and German, who fell.
'â¢Th< French Boldiers who found a glor
- t-rave at St. Privat also fdught
bravely and her - their Emperor
and fatherland. When "Vir Sags are low
bred In* greeting before this bronze statue
and flutter mournfully over the graves
of our df-ar comrades, m.-iy they wave
over the tomb? of our foes and whisper
that we think sorrowf illy of their brave â 
dead. With deep thanks and an upward â 
glance to th* 3 I^ord of Hosts for the quid- !
ance he so mercifully v.>u< bsafed to our >
â¢ Emperor, w*> will recall that thÂ»
countless souls of all who once stood face I
to face in hot encounter will look down
upon us from this day from whence they :
stand around the throne of the supreme
Judge, united In eternal peace"
Emperor William strongly emphasized
the words "all" urid â¢'notn in his utter- j
ances -when referring to "all" the brave
soldiers of "both " armies.

Limits.

Significant Letter of Regret From Dr.

of California,
The one hundred and fiftieth anniver
sary of Goethe's birthday will be cele

of the United States. Germany. England
and Russia. The San Francisco celebra
tion is to be a dignified affair. It will

The speakers of the evening will be Da
vid Starr Jordan, Stanford University;
Dr. .Lange. prolessor of English. Univer
sity of California, and Professor Goebel,
head professor of German in Stanford.
Dr. Goebel will speak in German.

Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, whose name

that he carÂ»not attend, and therefore sends
this letter of regret:
ITHACA.' N. T.. July 11. 189 ft.
Mr. W. 7Vmmermann. President of the Goethe
Anniversary. San Francisco. Cal.â My Dear
Sir. Your very kind Invitation to be present
and participate in the celebration of the one
hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth
<â¢'. Goethe on August 28 has been received. I
should certainly accent with er*at pleasure
were I to be in San Francisco on that date, but
the necessity of closing up my affairs in the
East and preparing to transfer my household
goods across the continent necessitate the post
ponement of my arrival in California until Oc
tober 1.
My sympathy with the spirit of German life
and German institutions, as represented in the
enthusiasm for the great spiritual leader of
Germany, Goethe, is strong and persistent. Five
years of my life have been spent under the
aegis of Goethe In German universities, and
under the inspiring- influences of German life.
As the German people are scattered throughout
the world and come under the allegiance to
other Governments than those of the Vater
land they will naturally find their allegiance tc
Germany not a political bond but a spiritual
one. and the headship and leadership which
they will recognize is rather such an one as
Goethe symbolizes than any one which prince
or â â ..â¢â  could embody.
I send my greeting? and best wishes to thÂ«
Germans assembled for the festival and trust
that some future occasion may enable me to
meet the members of the Deutseh-Callfor
nischer Verein in person. Very sincerely yours,
BENJ. IDE WHEELER.

GAGE'S LACK OF PATRIOTISM.
f~* OVERNOR GAGE announces that he will not
( ~~T declare a legal holiday in honor oi the return
â of the California Volunters. He gives this
lame excuse: "If I knew when the ship carrying our
troops would get here I would be glad to make that
day a State holiday. I do not want to make the mis
take of naming the wrong day, and interfering with
business all over the State to no purpose. In order
to make the holiday effective notice would have to
en tv County Clerks all over the State, and
there will be no opportunity to do this when the ship
is sighted."
The executive committee of the celebration desires
that the Governor shall designate the second day after
the arrival r>f the ship as the legal holiday. For ex
ample, if the ship should be sighted on the 22d, the
Governor on that day could issue his proclamation
apart the 24th as the legal holiday. The no
tion that County Clerks throughout the State should
have red tape notice by mail with the great seal of
California attached to parchment is the wildest non
sense. Notice of the designated holiday could be
transmitted by wire to every county of the State
within a few hour?. If the Governor had sense of
propriety or patriotism he would find an easy way to
honor the volunteers and respect the wishes of the
citizens who are making such noble preparations to
me the troops.
When the news reached California on January 15,
1897, that Huntington's scheme had been defeated in
rovernor Budd proclaimed the following
day, January 16, a legal holiday. On this short notice
mess of the State was not paralyzed. The
tion here is to give two days' notice of the
truth may not be acceptable to Gage, but
lie will hear it occasionally whether he likes it or not.
I: he would cease his secret intrigues with Dan Burns
ther shady politicians the people of the State
nould have a higher respect for their chief executive.
ould take half the care to honor the good citi
" as and noble volunteers that he takes to find places
at the public crib for the followers of Burns and
. many good and clean-minded men of the
ho would like to speak well of him would not
feel constrained to apologize for him. His refu-al
te a legal holiday in honor of the return
â  â  : California, when considered in the
light of the universal tribute to the event which all
of the p>'iple are so ready to pay. shows that
he is deficient in State pride and common sense.
THE PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTIONS.
rR< >M the East, where public interest in political
irs is always keener than on this coast, there
come reports showing that a good deal of atten
tion and tion is already given to the selec
tion of the cities in which the Presidential conven
tions of next year are to be held. Among the cities
n of San Francisco holds a prominent place.
Politicians who have had large experience in na
l] conventions are by no means agreed in favor
of !'â  uch conventions in large cities in the
center of the country. Some of the ablest men in
both panics arc of opinion the huge crowds of out
siders that swarm around conventions in Chicago and
St Louis are detrimental to the work the delegates
have to perform. Again and again such men have
advocated the selection of a city of second rate size
and somewhat removed from the centers of popula
tion. These ir.cn are inclined to favor a convention
in San Fran, i though the people of San
Francisco themselves do not put forward the claims
of the city.
A considerable effort was made to bring to this city I
the conventions of 1896, and at that time the advan
tages of the location for a midsummer convention
roughly presented to the national committees
of both parties. The facts then made known have
been remembered, and it is for that reason San Fran
cisco is now ( ! in the discussion going on
erning the selection of the cities at which shall
be held the conventions of tooo.
It -.vill be well for our citizens to take note of the
ing of the discussion of the subject at this early
[f there 1- to be any strong movement to ob
tain either of the conventions of next year it is time
to begin preparing for it. That our city will have
C Â° Tl -â¢' support in the Hast seems to be well
red. The very remoteness from the centers of
ilation, which has hitherto been urged as an ob
jection to holding a convention here, will now in
be regarded as an argument in our
:\n\ so remote from the East
â  inconvenient for the delegates, alter
ant such earnest citizens as desire to attend a
tion, but it will be too far for the great
of ward strikers and other noisy ghr,gs to come
merely for the sake of shouting for some particular
candidate.
The subject is worth considering, and now is the
time â¢ heed to it. While we are attending to
the patriotic jdy of welcoming home the returning
th< Eastern people are' busy discus
inal politic;. Every feature of the campaign of
is already earnestly debated there. Our city has

THE FINAL TEN THOUSAND
SO far the people of San Francisco have re
sponded liberally to the call for money to pro
vide a welcome for the home-coming volun
teers. The committee asked for $50,000. and upward
of $40,000 has been contributed or raised by means
of entertainments. Now the issue is to raise the re
maining $10,000.
It is well understood the sum should be contributed
promptly. The transport bearing our brave boys is
well on her way across the ocean. The date of their
arrival is no longer a question of weeks. In a com
paratively few days they will be here. â¢ The committee
should have the full amount required for the reception
hi its hands at once. Is it too much to ask the peo
ple to contribute the remaining $10,000 to-day?
There are some rich corporations that have refused
to contribute anything. No good citizen will feel like
classifying himself with niggards of that kind. Many
such citizens, however, have as yet failed to con
tribute. They have put the matter off from day to
day, believing there is time enough. Now they must
wake up to the fact that but little time remains. Be
fore the close of the coming week the boys will be
here. Everything in the way of street decoration, of
parades, fireworks, receptions, banquets and all forms
of festivities provided for the occasion, must be ready
in time for their arrival.
The sum asked for is comparatively small. With
about $40,000 already subscribed it ought to be easy
for San Francisco to complete the $50,000 asked for.
It will not be necessary for any one to contribute
much, if each will contribute a little.
Citizens of other States are preparing splendid and
bountiful receptions- for their boys on their return
home. Shall the Californians have a welcome inferior
to that of any other? Is this city,"renowned for its
wealth and its' liberality, to let its reception festivals
fall short for the lack of $10,000?
Such . questions answer themselves. Every citizen
should in proportion to his means contribute to tl!e
reception fund. The volunteers we are to welcome are
j not only our fellow-countrymen but our neighbors
and our kinsmen. Through the widespread ramifica
tions of their relationships and friendships they are in
touch more or less direct with almost every household
in the city. Surely where kinship and . friendship
unite with patriotism and State pride to prompt to
a glorious welcome for the returning brave there can
be no incompleteness in the reception.
Let us relieve the committee of further concern
about money, so that all of its energies next week may
be devoted to the preparing of the welcome. Let us
subscribe the final $10,000 to-day.
It is said that many commercial travelers have or
ganized themselves into a bureau of agitation to boom
the aspirations of Augustus Van Wyck of New York
for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency.
The drummers must expect to pay freight on con-id
erable excess baggage this season.
THE PRIZE-FIGHT LAW
BY the death of Franey, the pugilist, from blows
received in a prize-fight at Woodward's Pa
vilion the people of San Francisco receive a
fearful illustration of the working of the Gage prize
fight law. The bill, which was one of the scandals of
the Legislature, was converted into a disgrace to the
State by the signature of the Governor, and has now
resulted in its first tragedy.
At the time the bill was under consideration it was
condemned by all the decent elements of the State.
It was forced through the Legislature by the Burns
â  push, aided by certain Democratic allies, who, like
Burns and his gang, are closely associated with the
rounders and the toughs, whose delight in prize
fighting is in proportion to the brutality of the exhi
bition. Had Governor Gage been in the least degree
careful of public morals, of the dignity of the State
or of his own reputation, he would have vetoed the
bill. He was at that time, however, too eager to
procure the election of Burns to the United States
Senate to deny anything the supporters of Burns do
sired. He signed the bill.
Boxing matches are not in themselves cither brutal
or dangerous. When engaged in by true athletes they
are among the best contests of physical strength
i known to our race. Some of the most eminent men
in onr own country and in Great Britain have been
good boxers and ha(ve delighted* in the exercise. Like
all other sports, however, boxing becomes brut.il
when practiced by brutal people. Just as horse
racing, which was once proudly called "the sport of
kings" ha? been by the laxity of our i;;ws allowed in
many instances to degenerate into a system of gam
bling for touts and blackguards, corrupting to the
community, so boxing when transformed into pme
fighting becomes the pet pleasure of hoodlums and
human brutes, and breeds a menace to the community.
The essence of the Gage prize-fighting law is license
for a brutality almost unlimited. The only restric
tions put upon the toughs are that the fight- must be
hold under the patronage of an incorporated club, tint
i the fighters must wear glove-; of not lc<;s than five
ounces in weight, that the rounds . shall not ex
ceed "a limited number." It was asserted at the time
the bill was under consideration that the restriction of
such exhibitions to. domestic, incorporated athletic
, clubs would put an end to the fake fights and the
frauds which had become so frequent in the State.
We have seen what the restriction is worth. The
"athletic incorporated club" may be composed of
athletes in name only, and its incorporation may be
for no other purpose than to hold prize-fighting ex
hibitions.
In the death of Franey the Gage law has been
worked out (o its inevitable conclusion. The fair
promises marie for it have proven to be false. It is
licensed brutality at best, and in its worst degrees is
j much like murder.
Bryan, Croker. Ahgeld and Belmont are reported
to be the "big four" in Democratic national politics.
The correspondents charitably refrained from insinu
ating what cards these worthy gentlemen represent
i:i the deck, although four four-spots are considered
dangerous in any game except politics.
A PENNSYLVANIA PROBLEM.
A CURIOUS question of constitutional law has
been rai-ed in the politics of Pennsylvania and
has given rise to an excited demand in some
quarters that the Governor be impeached. From its
nature the i-Â«ue is likely to be interesting to lawyers
and to politicians throughout the Union, since a simi
lar problem nir.y ari=e in other States.
The question turns upon the right of a Governor :o
j refuse to advertise proposed constitutional amend
ments for submission to the people after the Legis
: lati'.rc has in proper form declared such proposed
! amendments shall be advertised and submitted.
By the Pennsylvania constitution any proposed
; amendment must be agreed to by a majority of the
j members elected to each House, and if a majority of
the members next after chosen shall agree to the
amendment, it shalj be submitted to the people. The
| proposed amendment in question was agreed to by
THE Â»AJN JJ'IÂ«AJN i;iÂ»UU CAXjIj, SAM U KUA X", AUWUM' 119. ISW.
two successive Legislatures according to the law, but
the latter Legislature appropriated no money for ad
vertising purposes, nor. for the installation of a sys
tem of voting by electricity which an election act
called for. The Governor thereupon "vetoed" the
resolution submitting the amendment to the people.
Certain advocates of the amendment have applied
to the court for a mandamus compelling the Secre
tary of the Commonwealth to advertise it, but the
County Court, in which the case has been heard, has
refused to issue the writ. From the brief reports of
the*decision that have come to us it appears the Judge
holds that a Governor has as much right to veto a
proposed constitutional amendment as any other act.
He is quoted by the Philadelphia Record as having
said in the course of his decision: "No satisfactory
reason has been given why the executive (Governor
or President) should not have the same share in
amending the constitution as in other legislation."
So far as Pennsylvania is concerned the issue is not
one of law purely. A good deal of politics is mixed
up with it, for the proposed amendment refers to the
registration of voters and is designed to put a check
upon machine politics. Both the Governor and the
Judge of the County Court are accused of standing
in with the machine. It is for that reason impeach
ment is called for.
The argument against the right of an executive to
interfere with constitutional amendments is strong.
If for any reason he may prevent the submission of
such questions to the people a marked innovation
will be made in our practice, if not in our law. It has
not been the custom to consider executive approval
necessary to a constitutional amendment nor to a
resolution submitting a proposal for one to the peo
ple. If it be true that the Governor of Pennsylvania
has in this case acted in the interest of machine poli
ticians he certainly ought to be impeached. Other
wise it would seem the courts are a good enough re
source, and the decision of the final court on the issue
will be awaited with no little interest.
The first echo of San Francisco's receptions to re
turning volunteers has come back from Nevada. In
passing through Reno on their way to Salt Lake the
Utah boys were high in their praise of the treatment
they had received in this city.
A Johannesburg correspondent cables that the
Transvaal Government is sparring for time. He fails
to state according to what rules â Queensberry or
London prize ring.
BACK DOOR IMMIGRATION.
RECENT revelations of the extent to which
Chinese enter the United States through the
New England States bordering on Canada ha^
led to an investigation of other immigration along the
same route. The result of the examination discloÂ«e^
that Chinamen are not the only unwelcome persons
who find an easy admittance through what may be
fairly termed the "open back door."
According to the Boston Herald during June and
July 1400 immigrants passed through St. Albans en
route for Xew York. In June there were 730; in July
670. This average of 700 a month is a significant ad
vance upon the summer record of other years. Quebec 1
and Point Levis, according to the report of the Com- :
missioner General of Immigration, received during the
year ending June 30, [897, 1046 people dcstwied for tlie
United States, and in 1898 received 5126. For the year
which closed June 30, 1590., the record shows an in
crease of over 60 per cent, 8196 being admitted. This I
is more significant when it is seen that the same year |
Halifax, the winter port, increased from 696 in 1897 i
and <)42 in 1898 to 3354 in 1899.
It is noted that the bulk of the European immigra
tion coming by that route is made up of Russian Jews
and other people from Eastern Europe. A consider
able proportion of that class of immigrants is known
to be made up of the sort of persons to whom admis
sion to this country is forbidden. Of immigrants ap
plying for admission to Xew York 138 out of eVery
jo.ooo are rejected, but by the Canadian route the rate ,

So well known has the route become that it v now
a favorite one with immigrants. St. Albans, Vt., is
but a small town, and yet as an immigrant port during
the years 1898 and 1809 it stood fifth in the list
As our Boston contemporary puts it, "the ranking of
the various ports for the entry of immigrants into
United Stales territory is New York. Boston, Balti
more, Philadelphia and St. Albans. After St. Albans
come San Francisco, Key West, Xew Orleans, Galve3
ton and other ports. Portland; Me., had but 502
United States immigrants in 1898; Halifax 942, and St.
Johns 1276. These comparisons give an idea of what
it means when it is said that Immigration Inspector
Forbes at St. Albans is passing 700 people a month.
It is stated the reason why this heavy immigration
by way of St. Albans has not attracted general atten-J
tion is that as soon as the immigrants are admitted I
they at once pass on to New York, where they are
lost sight of in the vast immigration that pours in at j
that port.
The time has come for Congress to deal with the
immigration problem in earnest. It is evident the j
restriction laws now in force are being evaded all
along the line. They are inadequate even in New
York and in San Francisco, where the closest .watch
is being kept of any ports in the country, but in New
England they appear of no effect at all. In that
section of the Union there is a wide open door for ill
comers, whether from Europe or from China. The
Roston Herald is rendering good service to the coun
try in exposing the evil, and the disclosures made
ought to serve to stimulate Congress to take action
this winter.

A TRICYKLE BUILT FOR NINE
BOSTON has just built the largest cycling machine In the world. It Is a tri
cycle, weighing nearly a ton and standing fully eleven feet high. It requires
nine men to operate it, one to direct its course and eight to propel its ped
als. It attains h great speed, too, considering Its weight, being capable of
over thirty miles an hour.
The machine was built .by the Boston Woven Hose Company, and has been
run by the company upon t he streets of Boston on several occasions. Its great
size has attracted f.or it much- attention. Its driving wheels are each eleven
feet in diameter, and weigh in the neighborhood of 250 pounds. They are rubber
tired and fitted' with ball bearing to facilitate their smooth running. They are
driven by chain Rearing connecting with a double shaft. Four sets of pedals
connect with each shaft, the men sitting in a row between the wheels.
The front Steering wheel is over seven fer>t in diameter. It is controlled by a
chnin and wheel easily handled by one man. He sits in front and guides its course,
evading -obstacles with little difficulty.
On a. level mad one man Could readily push It along from behind, but at least
three would be necessary to move it by the pedals. Eight, however, have no dif
ficulty even in fairly hilly districts.
NEW DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
By Judge M. T. Dooling
"When In the course of human events it seema advisable for a strong people to
unite with itself a weaker one by political bands of Its own forging, ana to deprive
the latter <>f thai separate and equal station among the powers of the earth to
which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to such action. '
We hold these truths to bo self-evident: That all men (except Filipinos) are
created equal; that they are endowed (theoretically) by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; thai among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness;
that to secure These rights (to the stronger) governments are instituted among
men, deriving their ju^t powers from the consent of the governed; that if such
consent be not freely accorded it may i>e compelled by the use of such force as
may be necessaryâ not to -exceed, according to the latest estimate, a force of 100,
--("i men; that whenever a weaker people, after 300 years spent in a struggle
against oppressors, are about to achieve their independence, it is the right of such
oppressors to transfer their shadowy sovereignty to a stronger power, whose duty
it Bhall become, after s ilemnly declaring that such weaker people are incapable of
self-government, to Institute a new government, laying its foundations on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their own profit, their own power anil their own giory.
Providence, indeed, will dictate that it be first determined that such struggling
people are Incapable of successful resistance, as all experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to claim for themselves the privilege of self-govern
ment than to accord it to their neighbors, and that the right of one. nation to pre
scribe the fnrm of government to which another shall be subjected depends entire
ly upon Its military force, and that thi extent of such right is measured wholly
by the physical power available to impose such government upon an unwilling
people. But when a long train of actions, pursuing invariably the same object,
evinces a design on the part of the weaker people to tree themselves from des
potism and to establish their own Independence, it is the right, it is the duty of the
stronger nation, If it but have the power, to subdue such people and impose upon
them such government as will provide tor the stronger new sources of future
profit. Such are the conditions which confront the United States, and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former theories of government.
i ' . recent history of the Filipinos is a history of resistance to repeated injuries
and usurpations, having for its direct object the prevention of a foreign govern
ment over their Islands. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world.
They have refused to recognize Spain's right to sell ;hem to us while they were
co-op< rating with us in an endeavor to overthrow the Spanish power.
'I"! ey have become rebels by r< sisting our pretensions, although they were pa^
triots while resisting the pretensions of Spain.
They have refused to accept the form of government which we shall prescribe
for them, although no man on earth knows what manner of government that will
be.
They have refused their assent to laws, which we have not yet passed, for their
(and our own 1 good, in the framing of which they cannot ascertain if they will be
permitted to have a voice.
They are unwilling that laws of Immediate and pressing importance should be
suspended In their operation until our assent should be Obtained.
They have refused to relinquish the right of representation in the Legislature";
a right inestimable to them, but <Â£ which it is our undoubted privilege (again if
we have the power) to deprive them.
They have obstructed the administration of Justice by refusing their assent to
our laws (to be hereafter enacted) for establishing judiciary powers.
They have objected to their Judges being made dependent on our will alono
fur the tenure of their offices and the amount mid payment of their salaries.
They have objected to the erection of a multitude of new offices and .he send
ing thither of swarms of officers to harass ihelr people and eat out tluir sub-
Btanc^.
'1 hei- have objected to the keeping among them in times of peace of
standing armies without the consent of their Legislatures.
i '!'â¢ â  have objected to the military being rendered independent of and su
perior tO '!-e Civil POW< r.
They have objected to our subjecting them to a Jurisdiction foreign to the.ir con
stitution and unacknowledged by their laws and to our proposed nets of pre
tended legislation: for quartering large bodies of armed troops among them: for
cutting oiT their trade with all puns of the world; for imposing taxes upon
them without their consent, for depriving ;.hem in many cases of the benefits
of trial hy jury; for transporting mem beyond seas to be tried for pretended
offenses; for abolishing th> ir own system ill laws nnrt establishing in its stead
an arbitrary government, gradually enlarging its powers bo as to render it a
fit instrument for introducing absolute rule ! nto their Islands; for taking- away
their Independence, abolishing their most valuable laws, and altering fundamen
tally their forms of government; for suspending their own Legislatures and de
claring ourselves invested with power to legislate for them in all cases whatso
ever.
They have objected to our declaring them out of all protection and waging
war against them.
They have objected to our plundering their seas, ravaging their coasts,
burning their towns and destroying the lives of their people.
They have objected to our transporting at this time large armies of
strangers to their soil to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny
already begun with circumstances of perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most
barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
In every stage of these repeated resistances they have endeavored to ascer
tain what we proposed to do with them. We have constantly replied with de
mands for unconditional surrender and pharasalcal platitudes about "a certain
measure of self-government." Before resisting our encroachments and while
still acting Â»r. our allies they sent representatives to our Government to as
certain our purpose, but we refused to receive them or to give the slightest ir.ti
mation of our intentions.
Nor have they been wanting in attention to our peoj^e. They have warned us
from time to time of attempts by our armies to extend an unwarranteable jur
isdiction over them. They have reminded us of the circumstances of their birth
in ownership of and love for their islands. They have appealed to our native
Justice and magnanimity and have conjured us by the "memory of out own strug
gle for liberty to disavow these usurpations i<n<i to concede to them the same
rights which we claimed for ourselves and which we are prepared to enforce i n
the face of all mankind. We. too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of
tradition. They must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
separation and hold us as they hold the rest of mankindâ enemies in war; in
pease, friends.
Now, therefore, the Jingoes of thÂ« United States, through the whole country
disseminated, adopting this new declaration, do in the name of but without any
authority from the people of this country solemnly publish and declare thnt the
Philippine Islands and all the people thereof are and of right ought to he subject
and aep< ndeni colonies; that we are absolved from all allegiance to the constltu
tion of the United States and the history and traditions of our Government' that
we have full right, if we can but muster the power, to subjugate strange and dis
taut peoples with whom we have nad no relation, who have never molested or
interfered with us, and of whose very existence nine-tenths of our people hive
hnd 1 : r til recently but a shadowy idea: and to this declaration and for that subiu!
gation we hereby pledge unlimited treasure exacted from our people and number"
less lives of the youth of our country.

until all countries shall adopt the sim
ples-t method. The French and other Con
tinental arithmel - express the first fig
ure as units, then tens, then hundreds,
following the same nomenclature with
the next three figures, so there is units
of thousands, tens ol thousands and hun
dreds of thousands: the seventh figure
expresses units of millions, the eolith
tens of millions and the ninth hundreds
of millions; the fourth group of figures
is denominated billions, and go fa . lV
threes. In Great Britain the m-!: d
there is a change, for instead ol
billions after hundreds of millions, â 
thousands of millions, ten thousands of
millions Mid hundred thousands of mil
linns, and then billions. This system
tends to makr- the system more compli
cated than the other.

There la a howl gains up from 420 men
on the United States battleship lowa over
the f - rved out to them by Un
cle Bam. The Ballon assert that their ra
tions are practically the same at --a and
in port. What the strict letter of the law
KB them they get, and any little deli- j
caclea or change of diet the men may
hanker after has to be smuggled aboard.
It is nothing: unusual to see l.alf a dozen

"Things have come o such a pass," said
John A. Sherman, s aman on the battle
ship, yesterday, "that we are now ob
of charity. La.-- lay we received
a donation of a >- ick of potatoes, a sack

Cracker hash and slumgullion are two de

!>iumg;;!lion Is made by pounding some
canned meat in a bucket of water and then

"Vhy, had it been k ilt would not have j

titles. One cun of corn or peas has to !

can't understand Is the fact that the ,
Government Insists upon feeding us;
canned mi ats at from 12 to 16 cents per
pound, while th<- best fresh meat can be
I t for 9 cents a pound or less.
"Last night I had the best supper I
have eaten In many a day. It was a
plirf of canteloupe, a peach, some canned '
Falmon and good butter. We had to thank '
the Dupont-street dive for that. This
morning we had spud hashâ again thanks ;
to the Dupont-street dive. There were
two sack. 1 - of Bpuds, and they had to go
around 420 men, but we had enough.
"It costs the Government $9 30 a month j
for each man's food. There Is no charge
for help, light or fuel, and no wear ana '
tear. I don't know how It Is. but if we i
had that $9 30 each and added a couple :
ol dollars a month each to it we could
live like fighting cocks."
Captain Terry says the men get every
thing that the rules and regulations call j
for; that they an allowed to bring dell-'
aboard, but that if the ship was i
divided up Into messes and each mess al- j
lowed to buy its own stores th.-r.- would
' dless confusion, and more odds and

Warships of Uncle Sam's navy.
This Is not a new growl on the part of '

It does not seem to have done them much i

DIED AFTER YEARS
OF PUBLIC SERVICE
HON. J. WEST MARTIN.
EARLY yesterday morning J. West Martin, a citizen of California, who
was widely known and highly esteemed, died at his home, 720 Fourteenth
strret, Oakland. Mr. Martin Was an enterprising public-spirited man of
affairs; While he attained much prominence in banking circles, the ser
vice which he rendered to the University of California in the Board of
Regents and in the Constitutional Convention of 187S-79 will be recorded
to his credit long after his record of business successes has passed out of the
minds of the people. He was appointed Regent of the University in IFSS and
served continuously until the beginning of the present year. He was elected
to the Constitutional Convention in IS7B, and with J. W. Winans and Judge
Hager, who were also members of the convention, zealously and effectively es
poused the cause of the university. They succeeded in obtaining a declaration
In the convention that the university should ever be a public trust. That dec
laration lifted the institution above the low plane of politics and placed behind
it the credit of the commonwealth. When J. West Martin a few months ago
retired from his long period of service on the board his fellow Regents adopted
resolutions testifying to the high character of his work in behalf of the Insti
tution.
J. West Martin was born In Maryland in 1R22. He first settled in Mem
phis, Term., after leaving Maryland, and there engaged in mercantile pursuits.
He came to California in 1853, settling in Livennore Valley. For a number of
years he gave his time and attention to stock raising. As his acquaintance
widened and his business faculties developed he sought a larger field for his
energies. He moved to Oakland and became interested in banks and corpora
tions. Subsequently he was chosen president of the Union Savings Bank, and
was also elected president of the Oakland Gas Light Company. The people
of Oakland, having high regard for his business abilities and ample faith In
his Integrity as a man, elected him Mayor of the city. His administration of
municipal affairs was highly creditable.
Many years ago Mr. Martin married Mrs. Jane Carneal, a daughter of
Hon. Henry S. Foote of Mississippi, and leaves surviving him one son, Shelby
Foote Martin, paying teller of the Union Savings Bank. Mr. Martin was also
the uncle of Hon. William D. English, Warren ii. English ajid John M. Eng
lish.
The funeral of Mr. Martin will be held to-morrow afternoon from St.
John's Episcopal Church, Oakland.
of amateurs. The wrestling: scene was â¢
absurd because the combatants were bo
unevenly matched. An audience cannot j
be thuseaslly deceived. The entrance of ;
l>e Beau, Mr. Mat nun. was a disappoint
ment, for he was not the courtly simple- i
ton, but a counterfeit, trying earnestly
to do his best. The usurping Duke, Wa.
lace Shaw, was without color, life or
spirit, and his lack of decision prevented
Rosalind's reproving speech from being
what it should be â angry sarcasm, and
delivered as such.
There was no good note of human fel
lowship struck In the forest, for the ban
ished Duke, Charles King, spoke his lines
without heart or conviction. Jacques, Mr.
Reynolds, looked too comfortable and
happy to suggest the libertine, sick of the
world's pleasures and full of false moral
izing and cynicism. Ho had no such
moods, and so the Duke ha 3 little to cope
with. Touchstone. Mr. Armory, was un
evenly good, and Cella, Miss Van Buren,
too demonstrative. They all seemed sub
merged in their parts, not by any single, :
definite limitation, but rather because
they have not been schooled in Uje legltl- I
mate and the rehearsals have beert in
adequate, j
Weighted thus Miss Hates and Mr.
Hlckman ' did surprisingly good work.
Never have I seen a more charming pic
ture than Miss Hates presented as the I
boy. She was plainly very nervous at]
first, so that her roguish martial air in- j
tentlons were somewhat defeated and tho ;
colloquial wit did not exert its full influ- â¢
ence on the audience. But from the mo- I
ment she spoke the words. "Woo me. woo
me." she seemed to lose herself in tho
part and became very charming. In ac
tion and portraiture she suggested Ada
Rehan, but In delivery she struck the key
of winsome maldenliness. The rollicking
spirit will oome with experience in the
part, which now has what many another |
has lackedâ a high-bred bearing and a ;
charming archness. The befooling of her I
lover was not done well, but this, too. i
may have been the result of nervousness, i
Mr. Hlikman made a graceful entrace in j
the front scene, delivered his lines Him- i
ply and earnestly, and thus won my sym
pathles at th*> "start. He rave a most I
conscientious performance of the part, j
f.ri'i though physically handicapped. Im- j
bued himself so' with the sentiment of tha
character that Rosalind's love for him j
Beemed a most natural consequence. Miss |
Mnulil was too crisply dressed as Phoebe
and rather strident in her delivery. Mrs.
Bates made n very good Audrey, almost
losing her Identity, so clever was her
make-up. The Forest of Arden was ao
prettily set that It should hnve inspired j
the characters to better work. "As You
I.lke it" is the most exacting of Bbnke-
Bpeare'a comÂ»dir>s, and two people, how
ever threat, cannot carry the fiction on to
success. CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
LABOR COUNCIL AFFAIRS.
Newspaper-Carriers' Delegates Were
Refused Admission to the Body.
The application of the newspaper car
riers for admission into the Labor Coun
cil provoked a long and tedious discussion
at the meeting last night. The principal
objection was that the carriers are not
wage-workers within the strict meaning
of the constitution of the Federation of
Labor.
Delegate P. H. McCarthy made a strong
Pica for the admission of the men who
distribute the newspapers, hut on a final
vote they were refused admission by 17
noes against 11 â¢ ayes. .Delegate Furu
seth moved as an amendment that the re
jection be only temporary and the secre
tary be instructed to correspond with the
*^deration of Labor as to the standing of
the newspaper carriers under the supreme
laws governing the labor organization
The 'boiler-makers' delegate brought un
the question of th* men of his union who
are working on the transport Hancock
at the Union Iron Works and who are
compelled to labor nine hours a day A
special committee of three was appointed
to interview Major Long on the sublet
and if the necessary satisfaction cannot
be obtained from him a communication
.will be forwarded to the Secretary of the
Navy. â¢>

Views.
On the Bth of this month Edward B.
Montague, who dally t-xhlbits a troupe c;'
trained birds at a local department store,
took as his wife Mrs. Elk-en Wilklns of
this city. Yesterday Mrs. Montague filed
suit against "her husband praying for. a
judgment declaring the marriage void.
The plaintiff alleges that when she en
tered into the marriage contract with her
husband she was insane, but recovering
her it ason on the 12th inst. immediately
left him and refuses to longer dwell In hid
home.
Justice of the Peace' Dunne, who mar
ried the couple, was greatly surprised
when he heard the news of the tiling of
the suit and the ground on which It wan
brought. In his opinion Mrs. Montague
has simply set forth that she was Insane
for the reason that no other cause exists
On the day of the ceremony Mrs. Monta

had divorced her husband, but she hoped

unhappy results. The Judge performed
the ceremony and then for naif an hour

Mrs. Montague entered into the conversa

TERESA BELL RESIGNS.
Robina M. . Muriel, Reginald and Eustace
Bell have left the "House of Mystery"
and their mother, Teresa Bell; and have
gone to live with Marie Bell, whom they
believe to be their sister, but whom Mrs.
Hell claims is not of their blood. Yester
day Mrs. Bell filed her resignation with
Judge Coffey as the guardian of her chil
dren and the duties incumbent upon that
position .will be assumed by Marie. On
June 21 the children, according to the res
ignation filed by Mrs. Bell, went to five
with Marie and have since remained in
her custody. Mrs. Bell says that at that
time she was led to believe that Marie
had been appointed their guardian In her
stead, but she has since discovered that
she was in error. Hence her resignation.
In an accompanying report Mrs. Beli
says that no estate remained In her hands
at the settlement of the last account filed
by her in the matter of their guardian
ship. She has received no money since,
and hence her application for discharge.'

WHY HE SHOT HIS SPOUSE
TEMPORARY INSANITY BUT ONE
OF THE CONTENTIONS.
It Is Also Alleged That the Prison
er's Divorced Wife Stabbed Him
Four Times Before He
Shot Her.
Patrick Keenan's defense is now under
way before Judge Dunne. After the
cross-examination of Ella Keenan, daugh
ter of the accused, J. N. E. Wilson, who
with Attorney T. J. Lennon has under
taken the defense of the accused, made
the opening statement. He said that he
would show that Keenan was not in his
right mind at the time he shot hia di
vorced wife, Anna, Domestic fury, he
said, had unhinged his mind, and when
the fatal shot was fired it was but the
culminating act in a domestic tragedy of
months, that left the mind of the pris
oner in a condition of complete irrespon
sibility. He also said that he expected
to prove that Mrs. Keenan had stabbed
her slayer four times before he fired the
fatal shot, and hence only did that which
j the law privileged him to do â defend his
I own life.
Gavin McNab. who was Keenan's attor-
I ney, te.stltied that Keenan had acted in an
erratic manner after the divorce, and alsn
that before that time the prisoner had
frequently asked his assistance in procur
ing him a position outside tho Fire De
partment, that he might be with his fam
ily. Joseph Mogan, former steward at the
i Receiving Hospital, testified that there
: were four knife wounds in the defend-
I ant's breast. In the region of the heart.
James Hudson and Thomas MeGovern
' also testified that Keenan had acted In
a strange manner after his wife, of whom
ihe was very fond, secured a divorce.

The untimely and violent end of Prize-
I fighter James Franey has been the source
of much speculation on the part of the
spectators of the fistic encounter and a
scientific set-to on the part of Drs. Lustig
and Zabala.
After his autopsy Dr. Zabala expressed
opinions which, if true, bespeak the unfit
physical condition of the fighter when he
entered the ring. He found no brain
lesion; simply a hemorrhage, as he termed
it, and one not sufficient to produce death.
The cause of Franoy's death, according
to the autopsy, was a "shock" in the
medical sense of the word. Dr. Zabala
says the man's vitality was not of the or
der to withstand the fierce and grilling
| work of a ring battle.
Dr. D. D. Lustig, the medical examiner
Of the National Athletic Club, has some
uncomplimentary things to say about Dr.
\ Zabala's autopsy and the findings in the
case. â  He wants to know by what mean*
it is possible to reach any defined knowl
edge whether it was the blow on the jaw
or the fall that produced the so-called
' "shock." The general verdict of the men
j who saw the right and the trainers is that
Franey was in line fettle. Dr. Lustig
pronounced the pugilist sound and strong
before the fight.
Yesterday .afternoon Dr. Zabala modi
tied his original statements by allowing
that it was impossible for any physician
to detect any such organic affections as
were afterward found in Franey by a med
ical examination of the pugilist prior to
the light. He said that lie simply told
what the autopsy showed and nothing
more. The following statement from Dr..
Lustig displays his feeling on the ques
tion:
Dr. Zabala's statement that Franey
was not physically fit to enter the ring
is absolutely absurd and would not be
made by any other physician or even
layman." In my professional capacity
as medical examiner of the National
Athletic Club I made a thorough ex
amination of James Franey and found
him physically sound and in condition .
to make a struggle 'requiring strength
and endurance. Aside from that his
actions, his appearance, his ability to
take such a drubbing for fourteen
rounds and the post-mortem examina
tion all show this.
His tine condition was commented on
by experienced men. Only two rea
sons can bo assigned for such a state
ment coming from Dr. Zabala â one,
his experience, he having practiced
medicine a. little over <â !:-â¢ year, and the
other maliciousness, the writer and the
Coroner's office not being on friendly
terms. D. D. LUSTIG. M.D.
Coroner Hill will hold an inquest this
; morning at 10 o'clock upon the body of
the pugilist.
The following have been summoned as
talesmen and nine will be. selected as a
jury:
C. V. S. Gibbs, 303 California street:
B. J. Smith, 25 Market street; Judah
Boaz, capitalist: William Cronan,
Eagle-street Metal Works; George D.

in causing Franey's death, were called
I yesterday morning Judge- Conlan's vourt
â  was congested with people. All the de
fendants were present except Hiram
I Cook and J. D. Gibbs. Attorney Mack,
who represents the National Club, stated
that Glt.bs was in bed suffering, from a
paralytic stroke, but Judge Conlan was
not .satisfied with this, ordering Gibbs to
i appear or a physician's certificate to be
i offered vouching for his illness. A con
tinuance of the cases was granted until
the Coroner's jury is heard from. Next
i Thursday is the day set for the examina
! tion.
| Tim McGrath. assisted by other friends,

i and a fair number of smaller subscrip
-1 tions rave been added. When J. J. Groom
j of the National Athletic Club, was ap
proached he put his name, down for $10,
i but when some one criticized the small
', ness of .the sum he sponged his name off
the list entirely. Enough money will be'
j collected to send the body to Portland

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 18.â A big attend
ance marked the fifth day of the race
meet now being held in this city under the
auspices of the Breeders' Association. A
number of local business houses closed
their doors at noon in order to give their
employes a chance to witness the sport,
ami many people were present from the
country. The lay was pleasant and the
track was in good condition.
The lirst race was a special match be
tween A. G. Guernett's bay mare Echora
Wilkes, by Nutwood Wilkes out of Lou
Wall, and the Santa Rosa Stock Farm's
brown mare Guy Cara, by Guy Wilkes.
The course was one mile and repeat. U.
Abies was up behind Guy Cara and A.
McDonald piloted Echora Wilkes. The
bay mare scored first in 2:18%, but Guy
took the second and third heats in
!:is^ and 2:19^4-
The second race was a two-year-old
pace, one mile and repeat, for a purse of

â coring, and the start was bad. Diablo
,\as several lengths behind and staid there
intll the half, when she closed up and
swung, into the home-stretch a good

>vire was passed, scoring in 2:23%. The
lext two heats went to N L B in 2:23* 4
Hid 2:25. .
The last heat was very pretty to the
hree-quarter pole, but there Diablo and
saken D both went into the air, and

ii the betting, both in the auction pools

BEARS ARE THE GAME
OF LAKE COUNTY MEN
While in Search of Missing Cattle
Charles Crabtree Comes Upon One
Which He Kills.
BARTLETT SPRINGS, Aug 18.â Some
days since several parties reported having
seen bear signs a few miles northwest of
liartlett Springs, while two persons re
ported having actually caught a glimpse j
of bruin. Among the guests at this popu
lar resort are a number of men who take
pleasure in shooting big game, and these
reports created the liveliest interest
among them. A party was organized, and ;
piloted by Professor George Watson, all
round promoter of sports and amusements .
at the springs, the expedition header! for
the district In which the bear was said to
have been seen.
The dogs soon struck the trail, but after '
following it for several hours It led Into
Impenetrable jungles north of Cache
Creek and the chase was abandoned.
Tuesday evening at a late hour the sports
men at the springs were stirred to fever
beat by the arrival of Charles Crabtree
with the carcass of a bear which he had
killed that morning near Eel River, about
eleven miles northwest of the springs.
On Monday Mr. Crabtree Started to
Snow Chain, a spur of Snow Mountains,
in search of some missing cattle. He car
ried ii repeating rifle and was accom
panied by an 11-month-old Irish cctti-r
puppy belonging to H. T. Barr. "When
Within a mile â >: Eel River Mr. Crabtrte
discovert I bear tracks. He put the- dug
an the trail and followed it about a quar
ter of a mile, when he observed the bear
running acro&s an open space about 130
yards away on the opposite side of the '
canyon. At the first tire the bear fell and
rolled me distance down the hill. The
bear recovered, resumed Its flight and was
Boon lost to sight in a thicket. The dog
started the bear again, but a second time
It took refuge In .i jungle of underbrush.
The baying of the dog Indicated the local
ity of the bear; but Mr. Crabtree failed to
rout it out by throwing rocks among the
brush, lit climbed a tree, and by throw
ing pine burrs into the thicket finally
drove bruin out. The dog quickly brought
the bear to bay, and Mr. Crabtree walked
to within fifteen feet of it and fired two
more shots. The first struck it in the
neck and knocked It down. The third, de
livered at short range, struck It In the
head and killed it instantly. It was a
black bear, dressed 175 pounds and was
probably three years old.
Two bears were trapped on Snow Moun
tain last week. Another was trapped In
the Sail Creek country about a year ago, i
but the bear brought in by Mr. Crabtree j
is the only one killed In this vicinity for
many years. There is said to be more
bears In the mountains of Lake County
than usual. Mr. Crabtree attributes, this
to the fact that the scarcity of water In
the foothills has driven them back into
the pine timber of the mountains.
Mr. Cfabtree lives near Little Horse
Mountain, about eight miles from Hari
l<Â»tt Springs. He farms In a small way
and makes a specialty of raising goats
During the. hunting season his trusty rifle
brings him In Quite a revenue. He has
lived here about fifteen years. During
that me be has killed nearly eight hun
dred deer. His record this season Is
twenty-nve. He has taken several bear
hunts, but this was his first successful
ore. He has a father and four brothers
who reside in Lake County, and all of
them are rated as good hunters.
Ed McCain and George Watson bagged
len dozen doves on Monday and all their
friends at Bartlett had .-i r/'nerous sun

RETURNS OLYMPIC CLUB BONDS.
The Olympic Athletic Club enjoys the
favor of the pods these summer days.
It has become the vogue among the hold
ers of the club's bonds to return them
to thÂ« officers with the request that they
be canceled. The latest windfall of this
character to the great athletic Institution
â ID'S from George Crocker. He held
$."000 worth of the bonds and has re
turned them, without consideration, for
cancellation.
Captain George James has announced
a cross-country trip of the members to

CHAMPIONSHIP BALL
AT RECREATION PARK
Sacramento and San Francisco Teams
Will Battle for toe Lead in
Pennant Race.
The topnotchers, Sacramento and San
Francisco, will meet on the Recreation
Park diamond this afternoon and to-mor
row. Every baseball crank in six towns
is waiting for the result and the patrons
of the game in this city will 111 1 the grand
stand and bleachers for both games.
Three weeks ago. when San Francisco
met Santa Cruz, then the two leaders,
there were 7000 people at the Sunday
game.
The local team leads the race by a nar
row marginal percentage. This series of
three games may send the Senators to the
head of the column if they have luck and
play as good ball as they have been doing
during the last few weeks of play. Last
Saturday and Sunday they defeated the
local team in the two matches at Sacra
mento. Uncle's men are waiting for re
venge, and the games to-day and to-mor
row will be for blood.
Fitzpatrlck is in better form than he
was last week, and this will place the
local nine in much better shape. He will
pitch two "lit of the three games, being
opposed to Harvey of Sacramento, whose
twirling has evoked bo much praise of
late, fbefg and Doyle will be In the box
at Oakland on Sunday morning.
Owing to the dissatisfaction manifested
in the game last Sunday on account of
Umpire Long's decisions, a change will be
Instituted in the games this week. Presi
dent Moran has secured the services of
Frank Graves, a veteran ball player and
an ex-National League man. The double
system will be tried, and if better satis
faction is obtained it is probable that two
umpires will pass judgment on the re
maining games.

YACHTS WILL RACE
FROM MARE ISLAND
k Great Fleet of Pleasure Craft to
Sail Down To-Morrow From
the Navy Yard.
The fleet of the San Francisco Yacht
Club will sail up to Vallejo this evening
and to-morrow will start down on the
j race to Sausalito. The smallest boat in
! the fleet wrll Htart first, at 10:30 a. m.,
! and will be followed by the other yachts
In the order of their size, J. I). Spreokelh'
; schooner I^urline being the scratch boat.
The yaxTits, the names of their owners,
time allowances and starting times, ar*Â»
shown in the following table:
H. R. Simpson's' yawl Tramontana was
measured yesterday and will enter- the
race. Her "time allowance will be given
out to-day. A prize (lap will be given to
the yacht making the fastest time down
from Vallejo. ami also to the yacht which
crosses the finishing line first.
On the way down to Sausalito the
rules of the road must be complied
with. The finishing line will be an
i Imaginary line drawn from the club
i house to' a stakeboat, which must be
crossed, leaving the stakeboat onthe star
! board hand. The finishing time will be
taken by the judges at the clubhouse.
; Barrett Fltbian's schooner Rover and J.
D. Spreckels' schooner Lurline will be the
scratch boats. Every yacht in the fleet
will receive a time allowance from these
two. The little We're Here starts at 10:80
a. m., while the Lurline's time for cross
; ing the line is 23 minutes 1- seconds after
j noon. in addition to the yachts of the
Ran Francisco fleet, the flagship Pactolus
of the California Yacht Club and E. N.
Walter's sloop Embla will take part in
the trial of speed. Commodore Allen M.
Clay having requested permission to have
the times of these two boats taken by the
Judges at Sausalito. The racing length of
the Pactoius is 34.33 feet, and that of the
Embla is 34.57 feet.
Independently of the general result, Dr.
A. W. McKeneie Is particularly desirous
that his sloop Sappho should beat G. E.
Billing's sloop Nixie, which on May 21
arrived ahead of the fleet. 11. R. Simp
kins' new yaw] Tramontana will be seen
in a race for the first time to-morrow.
The Corinthians start to-day on their
annual up-river cruise. Commodore Carl
Westerfeld's flagship Aeolus will be ac
companied by k. F. Sugar's sloop Edna
and Paul Biber's sloop Mlgnon. On board
the Aeolus will be the commodore. .R. H.
Morrow, F. E. gchol er and J. Short. E.
F. Bagar's companions will be Prank
Thompson, H. W. \Vesterfeid and J. M.
O'Brien, while on board the Mignon will
be Paul Biber and J. MeusdorfTer.
The race among the thirty-footers at
the regatta on, September 9 Him year will
be unusually Interesting, as Frank Stone's
sloop Presto and H. H. Goner's sloop are
new members of the class, and their quali
ties are as yet untried. The regatta will
serve to test the merits of the possible
defenders of the perpetual challenge cup..
It is doubtful whether the yacht race
set for August 27 In Monterey Bay as a
finale of the carnival of amateur sports
at the Hotel del Monte will take place,
as the arrangements for the reception of
the First California Regiment will prob
ably interfere with It. Admiral J. D.
Spreckels' Lurllne will be on hand for the
naval parade, as also will the pilot boat
Bpnlta while E. A. Wiltsee's schooner
Aggie is out of commission. Kx-('ommo
dore I. Gutte's schooner. Chispa will also
probably Join in the parade. Thus W. N.
McCarthy's schooner Ramona, H. R.
Simpkins' yawl Tramontana and Dr. A.
W. MoKenzle's sloop Sappho are the only
possible competitors.
Admiral J. 1), Spreckels has communi
cated with the commodores of the yacht
clubs with reference to the naval parade
to be held in honor of the returning vol
unteers. He states that he has fourteen
tugs and desires to have a yacht towed
by each of them. The California Yacht
Club will contribute the yawl Idler and
the sloop Pactolus, which have been as
signed to the division anchored off sec
tion 3 of the seawall. They will be there
on the morning of August 24 and will re
main there another day if it Is necessary
Commodore T. L. Hill of the San Fran
cis* will go over to Sausalito as booh
as the arrival of the transport Is known
and will sail his sloop Cygnus over to
North Beach, where he' will anchor her
.until it is time to join the procession.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT
AT DEL MONTE COURTS
Highly Successful Opening of a Series of
Events That Society Lool^s Upon Witfy
Favor and Liberally Attends.
Special Dispt teh to The Call.
DEL MON'TK, Aug. IS.â Del Monte's i
great s;)Â»rting event, which is one of the
most notable events or series of events of j
the kind that has ever occurred on the]
i'.uHM- Coast, opened at. 10 a. m. to-day i
with the first contest in the doubles hand
icap tennis tournament, and never did a
tennis contest begin with more perfect
weather arid under more favorable cir- !
cumstances than marked this. The courts :
w.r.- in pVrfect condition. Numbers of;
people witnessed the matches, both in \
the morning and afternoon, and great en- l
| thusiasm was evidenced by all. The ,
| ladles especially shewed their interest in
the play by freely applauding all brilliant
strokes. This feature of the tournament
has made the first day as conspicuous, a
social as an athletic success.
The handicapping in the tournament, i
which w.-is done on the sixth system, re-;
centlj adopted in England and America, I
was arranged by Sam Hardy and James
A. Code, and was a very complicated af- ;
fair. Each man was credited according
to his previous record, and was given or
>â¢â  prived of odds according to the skill of
bis opponents as determined by last
night's drawing.
To-day'a play held several surprises for
the crack players in the way In which
new men came to the front, notable exam
ples being Warburton and Fatlo of Santa
Clara, who won from Hunt and Stone, the
Alameda crack team', and Jones and Ar- 'â 
Buello of Salinas, who played right up:
Into the semi-finals, only going down In
a close contest with Sam Hardy and*
James i lode.
The tournament began at lit o'clock
with a match between A. W. Jones Jr
the Monterey County singles champion,
ana Louis !.. Arguello, who at one time I
held the Santa Clara County champion
ship, of Salinas, and Ray Emery of Reno
Nev., and Juhii Willey of Pacific Grove I
The latter team was given odds of half
lii teen in their favor. Jones and Arguello i
won easily with the score of 6â 2 6â3 !
despite the handicap. Hunt and Stone of i
Alameda, a team that is considered equal '
to any California players outside the
Hardys and Whitneys, then met Luke i
Warburton and Robert Fatjo-, the cham- I
pion double team of Santa Clara the
Alamedans giving their opponents fifteen
odds. Hunt was not in his usual form
on account of recent ill-health. The game
Wis fast and hotly contested. The Santa
Clarans won by a score of 6â2, 5 â 7, 6â3
The feature of the morning was the
battle of "Ponies" and "Giants"â W. H I
Pyburn Jr. and G. A. Rowling of Salinas
and Dr. Phillips- Nevada's singles cham
pion, and Grant Smith, a young but prom
ising California Club player. Phillips !
and Smith are both over six 'feet tall, and
as the Salinas men are barely over five
feet the combination was very funny.

FOUR MILLION TROUT
FOR MOUNTAIN LAKES
Fish Commission Is Stocking the
Streams Throughout the State
From Its Hatcheries.
Four million trout will be planted by
the officers of the California State Fish
Commission in the streams of the State
this season. To the ardent fisherman
these figures mean much, as the fish will
increase and multiply and will supply
royal sport in the years to come. The
; greater proportion of these game fish will
be placed in the lakes of the Tahoe sec
tion, but all parts of the State will receive
some. The fish are from the Sisson and
the Tahoe hatcheries.
A. L. Coombs and wife have returned
from Pelican Bay after a six weeks' stay
in that vicinity. While there Mr. Coombs
fished the Williamson River, and although
it is late in the season it afforded good
sport. The fly fishing at Pelican Bay is
pronounced disappointing. Trout appear
numerous, but decline to rise to the fly
The favorite method of landing them is
with the Wilson spoon. The shooting sea
son, which opens September l under the
Oregon law should be good. The marsli
in front of the lodge is covered with â¢snipe
and ducks.
A. B. Finch has "returned from his an
nual outing in the Truckee region He
went to Webber Lake in June and fished
white Rock Lake, Fordyce and Truckee
River from Truckee to Tahoe. The fish
ing in W ebber Lake proved somewhat
disappointing, although be secured all th*
trout he wanted with the fly.
J - p - Morrill of Verdi, .\\\\. writes Fish
and Game Commissioner Vogelsang that
he is meeting with a fair measure of suc
cess in having fish ladders placed in the
Truckee River where it passes through
.Nevada. He expects good ladders will do
placed on every dam in that State before
fall. During Mr. Vogelsang's recent visit
to Verdi he effected arrangements with
Mr. Morrill to take this matter up for th*
benefit of both States.
W. R. McFarland, who is collecting fish
for the aquarium :to be shown at the
forthcoming exhibition of Mechanics' In
stitute, says that Charles Green and oth
ers report the black bass fishing In Rus
sian River as being of indifferent quality
Mr. McFarland expects to make a. good
display at the fair. His collection is at
present in one of the Golden Gate Park
lakes.
The fishing at Lake Tahoe still contin
ues remarkable, being at its best near
Tahoe City. Here thÂ« catches still rim
from 50 to 100 to the boat for each day's
fishing. In one day over 1100 pounds of
trout were shipped tP this city. The fish
ing at the lake since June has been fro
most remarkable since any record has
been kept.

Pray, accompanied by their wives, leave

will' enjoy the fishing.

KID McCOY.
Who was knocked out by Jack IfeC â¢. nieht.
CHICAGO, Aug. 18â Jack McCor- ,
mack of Philadelphia knocked out Kid
McCoy in about one minute to-night.
The bout was to have been for six
rounds, and it was generally thought
rmack stood no show at all. He
himself said before entering the ring
that he was going in the ring to do his
best and let it go at that. The fight
was short, and so quickly over that
there was almost nothing to it but the
i punch that put McCoy to sleep. The
fight was und^r strict Queensberry :
I rules, hitting with ono arm free per- !
mitted.
Wh^n the gorig sounded McCormack !
started in to rusti things, relying on hip
. great-: b â¢ :_'!;: -and superior strength to
QCe. Ho received a ;
straight left in the mouth the first time i
he tried it, and a second later a say- i
i age left hook on the side of- the head. '
I Then he rushed twice more, car:
1 McCoy to the ropes each time. The :
, first time he hit M - ' the kid
! neys with his right. The second time,
jas they came from the ropes, still
! clinched, McCoy freed his left and sent I
a houk to Mc< Virmaek's cheek, 'impping
him to the floor.- McCormack lay quiet,
; making a pretense of claiming a foul, i
j although none had been committed. \
I McCormack rose on the order of Ref- j
eree Hogan with a sheepish grin on his
face. The knock-down had not injured
him In the slightest.
The men squared off once more and
then came the end like lightning from
a clear sky. McCoy was moving cau- I
tiously around McCormack, both hands
low down, neither being as high as the
belt. McCormack suddenly let fly his
right and it landed full on the jaw.
McCoy went down like a dead man
j flat on his back, legs and arms out
stretched, his face pointing squarely to
the ceiling. It was evident the instant
he struck the floor that his fighting was
over for to-night, at least.
Pandemomium broke loose in the hall I
and there were wild calls for McCor
mack and shrieks of "Get up, Kid," \
"Get up." Hogan went down on one i
knee by the side of McCoy and shouted i
his call of the seconds in the fighter's !
ear, but McCoy was past all hearing.
At the wurd "Ten" he raised his head |
slightly and Hogan paused an instant I
before he shouted "Out!" but M
was still out of it. Thirty seconds
would not have brought him into condi
tion to fight again..
The instant that Hogan shouted the
word that gave the fight to McCormack j
the yelling In the hall increased until it |
was deafening. The end had come so
quickly that it took the crowd a few 1
seconds to realize that McCoy had been j
beaten. The seconds of McCormack â¢
fairly hugged their man in their de- !
light, and the big fighter stood with a
smile on his face as though wondering
how it had all come about. For all
that, he had won a good fight, fairly
fought and fully deserved his victory.
The general opinion seemed to be that j
McCoy lost the fight through an excess ;
lof confidence. His easy knock-down of ;
McCormack in the opening of the fight ,
had given him an idea that he would ;
have it all hl3 own way to the finish,
and he was not as careful as he might
have been. He made no effort at any
time to block the leads of McCormack,
simply making motions as though to
push them aside. It worked a number ;
of times, but finally it did not. and he ;
lost the fight. McCoy was helped to j
his feet by his seconds and walked 1
slowly to his corner. He was gaining !
strength rapidly again, and by the time
he reached his chair was ready to fight
again. He took his defeat very much to ,
heart, but did not say anything.
Before the fight it was announced by
Tommy Ryan that he had come to j
Chicago for the purpose of making a '

match with McCoy at loS pounds at

There has beÂ»n bad feeling between
the men for years, and it added bitter
ness to the defeat for McCoy to have
his old enemy see hi? defeat.
After the tight, while McCoy was sit
ting in his corner, Ryan came up to
him, laughing, and said: "<>h. give me
a match. McCoy. Give me a match."
McCoy did- not even look up as Ryan
walked away and n ply.
McCoy would say very little after the
fight, merely claiming that it was a
chance blow which
In a hundred fights by a
man of McC irmai k's ability.
mmy Ryan said: "I was not look
ing for it Just that way. I'll admit. I
don't know what I was looking for, ex
actly, but it â  - c. thing to me,
and that is. McCoy has lost his. sightâ
his fiizhtir.K sight. He can't B
hand at a time. When McCormack
ted with thi- left h^ drew back,
threw out his right a little to stop the
he thought w:is coming. He never
saw the right at all. He thought that
left feint was all there was to it. He
simply can't see two hands un an oppo
nent."
â¢'.e'jrge filler- said: "It looked to me
like a fight lost through overconfidenee.
I don't mean to take anything from
McCormack when I say that, for he
won his fight fairly and honestly. Mc-
Coy acted as though he had an
thins of it. and his knock-*down of M>
noed him that there was
1 ne man to it. He was not careful
enough with his guard, it seemed to
me, but then these very things are
what lose and win a fight. A' man is
t"'iind to get punched If he don't stop
the punch. The men could probabiy
fight a long time before such a thing
would happen again, but it happened
thi? time and McCormack is entitled to
all the credit."
Long after the fight was over Mc-
Coy consented to talk about the knock
out. He seemed almost broken-hearted
and sat in his room with a hopeless
look en his face, saying nothing save
wh>"-n questioned directly.
"I suppose," he said, "that I held
McCormack a little too cheaply, but
for all that I was not fighting care
l-s.-ly. and I want it undrn-toud that
I was fairly and honestly beaten. I am
making no excuses whatever. McCor
mack fought me in a manly way and
won a victory. However, I still hold
the opinion- that I am the better man
and if McCormack will give me another
chance I am willing to fight him
again."
When asked concerning the actual
kr.o-ckout McCoy said:
1 I really knew absolutely nothing
about it. The last thing I remember
is seeing McCormack on his knees
after I had knock d him down. What
happened after McCormack got up I
don't know. I don't remember that he
did get up, but I guess he must have
done to," lip said with .1 feeble laugh.
When asked about Ryan's taunting
him for a match McCoy said: "I never
h";ird it. I mver saw him. I wa.6
back in my room before I knew any
thing at all."
McCormack said: "I was satisfied
from what I had heard from Ryan
and others that I. could beat McCoy,
although I naturally did not think I
could do it so quickly. The victory has
not inflated me with the idea that I can
beat any of the other great fighters,
but Just the same I am going after
some of the best."

BATTING AVERAGES.
RACING IN MONTANA
IS TO BE REVIVED
One Hundred Days of Sport Next Sum
merâMarcus Daly to Race a Big
. String Here Next Winter.
From reliable sources It is learned
there will- be one hundred days of racing
In Montana next summer. The circuit will
probably include Butte. Anaconda and
Great Falls, the report to the effect that
the Anaconda track would be plowed up
proving to be a canard. There has been
no racing in Montana to speak of. during
the present season, as the shopkeepers
were complaining of hard tim^s and
Marcus Daly wisely concluded to give the
people a rest. Substantial purses and a
world of coin in the betting ring has made
this section of the country very popular
with horsemen, and there .will no doubt
be an exodus of California owners in that
direction next spring.'
Frank McMahon, he of the smiling
countenance and winning ways, well
known as the former owner of the good
Performer Pat Morrisey, arrived from
Montana Wednesday, accompanied by
Henry Gerhardy, the widely known
trainer. and owner. The latter is col ik T
k-red one of the most capable men in the
business. When the Corrigan horses were
winning all their races here last winter
they were handled by the ex-jockey. At
the close of the season Henry severed his
connection with Corrigan, since which
time the game has been a losing one for
the dethroned ruler of Ingleside and
Hawthorne. McMahon has in training at
Sacramento Stromo, Black Orphan and
Unknown, while Gerhardy expects to win
several purses with his i-year-old Alaria.
Billy Randall, the Great Falls horse
man, recently suffered a sad bereavement
In the death of his "mother, who passed
away at her home In lowa. Mr. Randall
is now in Montana and will ship -his
horses, at present racing in the East,
to Oakland track in about ten days.
Marcus Daly will race a big string of
horses here next winter, some twenty
seven in all. The veteran Dan Dennison
will train and manage the stable, which
will be headed by the crack handicap
horse Imp. Isador, one of the best weight
packers in the country. Some Bitter Root
yearlings that are reeling off three fur
longs in the neighborhood of ?,<o\ 2 seconds
at this early stage will also help to make
up the stable.
Three Montana stables lately arrived
at Sacramento, attracted by the rich
purses offered at the State Fair.
"Whisky" Williams baa in his string
White Fern, Croker, Silver II and a 2
year-old by Sam Lucas. "Bill" Pheno
will send Willm<ter and two others to the
post, and Guy Deming will depend on old
I Don't Know and Juva.
Pat Reagan, the papular assistant of
Starter Jim Ferguson, who has been so
journing at Tuscan Springs, is back In
town. When the hostelry at that place
burned down Pat escaped from the build
ing with his clothes on his arm, while
a dampened towel protected a freshly
grown crop of luxuriant whiskers.
A recently arrived turfite from the East
says that Henry Shields can now ride
at ninety pounds.' If that is the case th&
elongated rider must be suffering with
consumption. . â¢ â¢
â¢ â¦ â  .
A Pioneer Passes Away
Thomas J. Glhon, one of the best known
pioneers, passed away at his home on
Thursday after a few hours' Hlness. His
death was as peaceful as it was sudden.
He had returned to his home feeling In
disposed, and shortly after his arrival he
became unconscious and while in that
condition died. Mr. Gihon arrived in this
city in- the early (if ties and engaged him
self with the Pacific Mail Company. He
was In its employ for many years. Tir
ing of the sea,, he returned to his busi
ness of engraving, which he was actively
engaged In up to the time of his' death.
The funeral services will be held to-day
at 1:30 o'clock from the chapel â¢of the
Good Samaritan, Second street, between
Howard and Folsbm. The interment will
be private.

Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York fay:
"There is a dullness in actual trade, but in
quiry increases and the outlook ; for a good
tni'le in futures is encouraging. It is so much |
so thr.t holders â â â  firm in their views and re
fus3 to grarit concession?, being under the im
pression that if they maintain their present
prices distributors will be compelled to pay j
them or go without stocks. â¢ As long as the
present difference of opir.r.r; uetween buyer and ]
eeller exists there will be a dull market, so far ,
Its actual transactions go.
"Prunes are attracting considerable atten- . .
t!on, but with the exception of occasional small |
lots trading is limited. Offerings are on -a ;
basis of 3uc for ftinta Clara goods foe early
ehipm'ent and 3c for outside. Even at. these
figures little business is done, orders for the
niu.-u part being for small quantities. The crop
Is e=timatf>o somewhat below last ear's output
In California and as a practical failure in the
Northwest and road.
"Peaches are not Belling very rapidly at pres
ent prices. There Is little trading, but plenty
of Inquiry for futures. All supplies are held at ;
6%C Htm, f. o. b., in bags, the coast. While
gales are not large, holders are very stiff in
their views and buyers show no disposition to
inp^t them. The output will probably be heavy
and conditions favor a continuation of the pres
i-nt' ftrons position. Buyers profess to think
that prices will lie lower and that better oppor
tunities to purchase will be afforded later. It
Is said however, that present prices will rule i
for the balance ol this month and the first of j
next. Some holders are firmer in their views
and insist upon fi^c. It is not known that any
pales have iÂ«>en made at that figure, however,
and buyers say that none will be made.
"Raisins arc quiet and trade is limited to
small retail orders. Consuming demand is
trnall at this spaÂ«.n, but there is plenty of
inquiry for futures at prices to b<? rna-le by the i
association. Conditions of the growing crop are
promising anl indicate that the yield will be
almnst as large as last year, though some
shortage, at present undetermined, is prob
able."

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Auk. IS.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will aay: A somewhat easier
lon of the money market has been re
flected In stock speculation by the prevalence
of a moderately bullish sentiment. The
g has been narrow and professionals are
still mainly responsible for the activity. The
bave Bhown some aggressiveness, par
ticularly in connection with Traction stocks,
while bullish tendencies have been must con
spicuously shown in the low priced railn ad
shares or certain Industrials. London has not
factor, though the financial situation
there has Improved, thr- Bank of England ex
hibiting a good Increase in cash and reserves.
The Berlin money market on the other hand
is undergoing another slight disturbance in
Interest rates, which have advanced sharply
and seem likely to attract g..!d from London
to the German capital. The weakness of the
exchange market" and the favorable character
of the July trade statement tend to keep up
an Idea on the part of Wall street that there
will be an autumnal gold influx this year.
Shipments of specie from Australia to' San
Francisco are occurring from time to time,
but expert opinion Is that comparatively little
gold under present financial and trade condi
tions can be expected from abroad, another
conclusion being that Europe will not deVelop
a demand for our securities. It was noted,
however, that Louisville and Nashville owed
Its rise this week to an Initiative on the part
1 : London and that pome other of the inter
national specialties were bull there.
Irregularity has prevailed in the Industrials
ami specialties. The week began with a break
In American Ftoel and Wire, caused by the
fad thai a synopsis of the statement pre
sented by the company to the Stock Exchange
did not come up to anticipations as to earn-
IngÃ, On the other hand, Tennessee Coal de
veloper! great rtri-ngth and rose to 92% on
manipulation, together with relports that back
dividends on the preferred stock are to be ad
just â¢â¢! and the common placed on a dhldend
paylng basis. The Tobacco stocks also rose
sharply, American common selling up to 126
and continental Tobacco (common) to 50% on
the statement that the two concerns had ac
quired control of the Buchanan and Lyall
manufactory. Other rather- tentative bull
movements were seen In various Industrial?,
the Steel stocks showing some strength, which,
however, they did not retain. American Smel
ter was higher on the report -that the strike
at its C( lorado establishments had been settled.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit was a feature, break
ing to 108% on the statement that there were
dissensions in the management, that the presi
dent, Mr. Rossi ter, was to resign in conse
quence of the results of his course during the
strike and that the current net earnings were
d<-cld-?dly adverse to any presumptions about
speedy dividends. At the decline support was,
however, forthcoming and the price rallied to
11214. Consolidated Ice, an inactive Industrial,
distinguished itself on Wednesday by making
a 11-point decline, from which It rallied when
support appeared. Sugar was more than
usually irregular, falling from 164 to 156% and
rallying only tc fall off again.
â¦ $> i
Bradstrcet's on Trade.
<e> -Â»>
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â Bradstreet's will say
to-morrow: The trade situation gathers
strength as summer wanes. Reports of ex
panding fall demand arrive, accompanied by
I very cheerful advices as to the outlook in most
j parts of the country- In manufacturing lines
j production appears to be at a maximum and
; the price (situation retains most of ite old
i strength. Notable In the matter of added
strength are most of the cereals and iron and
steel in many forms. The impetus given to '
v.hetj. prices by the Government report last
week has bÂ«en further reinforced by less fa
vorable crop advices from other countries,
notably India, am] export business Is reported
I somewhat improved. Advices as to the com
j crop are still as favorable as ever, some States,
: notably Kansas, reporting phenomenally large
>i.-l is. Judging from numerous reports, the
ecarcity of supplies of iron and teteel is becom
ing increasingly serious, Hupplies of structural
I and shipbuilding material being reported Inade
quate at a number of points. There is an ap
pearance of quiet a.t Eastern markets, not
shared In, however, by Western centers, where
sales are reported large and price advances nu
merous. The question of outlook as to prices
seems to be largely transferred to next year,
and liberal bookings are reported for the first
quarter of 1900, with some Southern engage
ments reported running as far ahead ap au
tumn a vcar frum now. A notable exception to
the general strength to prices is found in raw
| cotton, which has disregarded almost unani
mously reports of crop deterioration and lost
all of lost week's advance uwlng to the Issu
ance of a bearish crop estimate, which from
the present outlook at least seems very heavy
and at the least prematurely issued. The
etrength of the cotton goods market is main
tained, though advances are as yet small.
In woolen goods orders for llgntweight men's
wear gooods continue; heavy and raw wool,
though less active, is no less firm, and high
grades are particularly well held. .-The ad
vance- In boots and shoes Beeme to have been
felt but -little, and the flight gain' in leather
prices . Imparts . a very. firm tone. to hides. Most
staples, aside from those mentioned; are firm
and unchanged on the - week. â¢ Lumber -still re
flects activity in building, and advances at
Western markets are again reported-' Current
railroad earnings show little reflection of the
falling off In the grain movement and make ex
cellent comparisons with preceding years, and
the like is true of net earnings mentioned else
where.

;' Dun's Review of Trade..
Â« . â : 1
Â« â  *
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s j
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
The Cramps have discharged many hundred j
hands and ask Russia to extend time for the i
completion of two warships because they can- ]
not Bet the steel. Completion of 21 out of 37
vessels building: In the Delaware Is also affect
ed. It Is a curious experience for this country,
but shows the gigantic expansion of home de
mand. No one can question the fact that pay
ments through the principal clearing houses '
have been in August 55.9 per cent larger than I
I In ISB7 for the month thus far, and outside
New York 23 per cent. No better, test of the
volume of business is' known, but there Is a
growing handicap In the advance of prices.
How long and how far this advance can go
without reaction Is the problem which level
headed business men are studying. Evidences
of checked consumption are rare, but it would ;
be childish to hope that at some point higher
prices would not hinder buying-.
InÂ»iron the question is of steel billets, which
the great consuming companies have . bought
far in advance, so that all new orders have a
narrow market. For six months billets have
j sold at $4 to $6 higher than the rails made from
them. Other demands not covered by contracts
are mainly for various shapes and sizes only
prescribed in contracts. : While prices have
risen 25 cents for Southern pig iron, 60 cents for
Chicago local coke and 75 cents for gray forge
at Pittsburg. rails have advanced $1 per ton
with work covered for all this year, .and 400.000. j
tons or more taken beyond what, can be de-
I levered until next year. : other finished prod
ucts do not change, although the demand at all
points exceeds present capacity. Copper is
steady at 18% c for lake, with production for 1
July 21,333 tons domestic and 7490 tons foreign. j
Tin Is lower at 30% c and lead weakens on the
stoppage of smelter strike.
For wool Coatea Bros.' circular for August 1 I
still holds good, although inside quotations are
more often made. Sales for three weeks have
been 28,299,990 pounds, against 13,996,500 pounds
last year. .38,530.305 pounds In 1897 and 23,365,400
pounds In the same weeks of 1892.
Goods have advanced further, especially In
j cassimeres cheviots and cotton warp cash
, meres, and the tendency Is upward in nearly
all grades. .â¢ . j
Wheat has advanced about a cent during the '
week, with Atlantic â¢ exports only 2.363,802 i
j bushels, flour included, against 3,059,380 bushels !
last year and Pacific exports 961,326' bushels
I against 175,400 bushels last year.
Western receipts have been only 3.212,117 ;
j bushels, against 3,869,229 bushels last year. It '
is a question whether the smaller receipts are 1
due to recent change in crop prospects giving
holders of grain a better outlook. Exports of
wheat In three weeks have been from both i
coasts. Hour included, 9.973.764 bushels, against
10,114,246 bushels las-t year /and the Western '
receipts have been 11,864.696 bushels, against !
9, 015,180 bushels last year. . . !

Chicago Grain Market.
Â« 1
CHICAGO, Aug. 18.â Liverpool, always an
influence on local wheat trading, showed an !
opening decline of v;d, which was unlooked for j
after yesterday. s advance here, and had the re- 1
suit of depressing prices about He at the open- i
Ing, September starting at 71Vg@71.Vic. The sell- I
Ing pressure, however, came almost entirely I
from small speculators and was of a local na- |
ture. It was not heavy enough to long depress |
prices, and soon after the opening the market
beÂ«an to rise and lor the remainder of the ses
sion showed considerable firmness. Reports of
a big cash business done yesterday, industri
ously denied by the bear crowd, were confirmed
to-day and the Influence of the cash demand
was augmented by further heavy bids to-day.
The actr.a! amount of business done could not
be ascertained, as shippers would not give out
their transaction* until freight rates had been
secured, but rumors of large quantities worked I
were so thick that they had a marked effect
on speculation. Heavy rains were reported in
the Northwest, and apprehension of wheat
sprouting and being otherwise damaged in
creased the demand. Another and more bullish
feature of the Northwest news was the con
tinued disappointing thrashing reports, which
strengthened the belief that recent crop esti
mates were too large. St. Louis and local
shorts bought heavily at times and this bulled
the market, bringing the smaller fry to cover.
September advanced to 72c. well above calls
but realizing sent it to 71%@71?ie, where it
closed, an advance of sfce over yesterday.
Corn was firm for September, barely steady
for later months and dull for all. It was
mostly a scalpers' market. September closed
KOfte higher.
Oats showed more activity than usual. It fol
lowed wheat In the main, but there was con
siderable selling at the opening. September
closed a shade higher.
Provisions were selling with a somewhat
broader market, prices advancing all round.
A good consumption demand was reported by
packers, and this was the basis of the specu
lative strength. Lack of offerings was a fea
ture. At the close September pork was uc
higher, lard 2%c higher and ribs 2%@6c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follow:

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been the following deliveries of
coal,' Viz., seven from Washington. 14,341 tons;
four from British Columbia, 14,182 .tons; two
from Oregon, 1150 tons; three from Australia,
7073 tons: total, 36,746 tons. We have had lib
eral arrivals this week, still the accumulations
lin yard are not noticeable; in fact, s in some
yards there 'is not a week's supply on hand.
The coal is procurable, but the carriers are "not
to be had, as sailors and steamers cannot be
chartered; they have been diverted to other
lines of business, more profitable than coal
transportation. The total amount cf foreign
coal that can possibly arrive within the next
j thirty days will not foot up 25.000 tons, equal
I to about six days' consumption; this is exclu
sive of British Columbia j products.' which
might be classed as foreign.. This emphatically
demonstrates how entirely we are at the mercy
.of the coast colleries for a fuel supply. In
other words, they control this market, for fully
75 per cent of the fuel necessary. In this age
of syndicates' and combines; where the inter
j ests of ' the 'dear public' are ruthlessly sacri
ficed for the advantage of the few, it is gratify
ing- to make reference to an opening which' is
not availed of.. The coast coal managers num
ber about five, who can make the price -of coals
whatever they may elect, as 90 per cent of our
fuel comes through them, yet they show no dis
position to show their power."

Eggs and Cheese are dearer this week. But
ter remains unchanged.
Fruits and Vegetables have been In enormous
supply during the past ten days, and large
quantities have been dumped into the bay and
sent off in swill carts to clear the stores and
wharves.' It is the same every year at this
time, , when everything seems to get ripe at
once, â  but owlne to the cold foggy weather,
which has restricted the usual demand, the
situation is worse this year than. usual. 'Con
ditions will probably Improve, next week, for the
annual summer glut does not. usually last over
a fortnight at the longest.
Poultry continues in liberal supply and cheap.
Meats are about the same as last week, though
Mutton and Lamb are higher in the whole
sale markets.

Photographs of his family sold tot 25
ents apiece and generous collections
at the First Presbyterian Church
several years ;:p" formed the nucleus of
â  fortune which John Ales ai lÂ» r
T>. .-.\ ;. . the faith healer, now controls In
Chicago.
l 'â¢â â .\ le created a bi nsation h< re li
bj opening a "divine" healing mission In
ihis city, with an office attachment, where
patients paid fiom (1 i Â» $10 per visit, ,u-
cording to their means. His private prac
tice In Oakland assumed large proportions
â¢ claimed to have restored the sight
of a Mind girl and to have caused a deal
to hear, but iho names and address
es of these lucky parties could never be
ivered. When he came to ibis city
he represented that he was going u> start
a garden of Eden, where the sick would
b< healed, the blind mark- to see ai I
where the tire? would be kindled by the
crutches discarded by his guests. Liberal
subscriptions were Becured to carry out
this project, and with a certain class of
enthusiasts Dowie was in great favor.
The "divine" healer made a hit at the
start by securing the Firs; Presbyterian
â¢ h, as this move gave him a st I d
â : >. in the community at once. The pastor
of the church was absent at the time and
Dowie'B methods were not known to the
trustees until they saw his operations.
Then there was much indignation ex
pressed' and the healer was forced to
leave in.' building. He then procured
Hamilton Hall and held a meeting every
night, telling of the miraculous cures he
had effected.
At last the Oakland newspapers liber
ally roasted Mr. Dowie. at which the "di
vine" healer became pugilistic. He threat
ened to use his lists on the men who had
written the truth concerning his opera
tions, but when an opportunity offered
the alleged holy man "took water."
Th*- healer was requested to explain
what he did with the big collections, the
generous subscriptions and the liberal fees
paid to 'him, but he declined to put any
explanation on record. He wound up this
incident by declaring at a special meeting
that newspaper men were similar to the
scribes of Christ's tim". When the col
lections fell off Dr.wie departed. While
here many thousands of his photographs
were sold for 23 cents apiece, and many
are still in existence. To the ultra en
thusiastic these photographs were re
garded somewhat as < harms, some pecu
liar property being attributed to them be
cause of the alleged power of the man
whom they represented,
A few days ngo Information was re
ceived in Oakland* from Chicago showing
that Mr. Dowie did very well with the
support lie received In Oakland. He went
to Chicago after plÂ« king up a few prac
tical Ideas from nrlgnam Young's de
scendants en rcut< ami established Zion
City. A few days ago Mr. Dowie sent
out circulars to the faithful urging them
to greater liberality In supporting the
cause. He calls himself "the representa
tive of God on earth and general overseer
of the Christian Catholic Church." He
declares that "Zlon is hard pressed" and
needs much aÃsistar.ce. Some of these
circuiaÂ«s reached his old enthusiasts in
Oakland, but no one has as > â¢â¢ i . so far

"Walton" was staying at the Lester

Oakland OfFu San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 18.
The above In brief Is th..- record of Ar
thur Arlington, whose trial, bo tar as the
taking of testimony is concerned, was
closed before a jury in Judge HalTs court
this afternoon. Arlington was put on the
stand to testify in his own behalf, and
on cross-examination the prosecution
sprang a surprise by getting him to admit
that he had been twice before convicted
of grand larceny. With this fact admit
ted the prosecution then put In evidence
the judgments in both cases, and on be
half of his client Major McElrath admit
ted the convictions. Had Arlington rot
been imt 0:1 to testify there would have
been no chance to get the facts of his
record before the jury, and matters now
appear very gloomy for the aged bunkoer
On direct examination Arlington to-day
gave a detailed account of ah alleged visit
to the Richmond House in San Francisco
on 'the night of April 14 last in company
with Mrs. Smith, who accuses him of hav
ing robbed her on that very day. Mrs.
Smith had just taken a seat near her spe
cial counsel. F. W. Fry when the accused
man opened his narrative, and the state
ments roused the young woman s anger.
"On that visit," continued the corpulent
arid aged Lothario, 'we remained at the
Richmond all night, after having had
dinner and something to drink.
This statement directed against his fair
accuser who is suing her husband for a
divorce proved the straw that broke the
camel's back, and unable to suppress her
auger any longer Mrs. Smith turned to
her attorney and in a whisper that was
audible enough for Arlington to hear she
Â«aid- "I'll have to shoot that man. 111
do it vet. It's the only way I can get full
redress for the wrongs he has done me."
But Attorney Fry expressing himself as
"not doubting that the man is bad enough
to be shot," advised his client to compose
herself, as she would "get redress in an
other way." â¢"â â â¢'â  - '
Arlington gave his testimony in an easy;,
careless off-hand manner, and while in
the hands of his attorney his memory fal
tered not and his answers came without
"lie a had told of his sincerity of inten
tions to engage Mrs: Smith to take care
of his little daughter, who, he said, was
born in 1889; but on cross-examination by
Deputy District Attorney Samuels wit
ness" attention was called to the fact that
from 1887 until October, 1803. he was a
prisoner in San Quentin. Several mo
ments elapsed before witness, after objec
tions by his attorney, proved equal to the
occasion, and he answered by way of ex
planation that the child's mother was D
widow when he married her. On cross
examination witness was very careful, al
ways halting before answering, profess
ing' Ignorance and frequently giving mat
ters "to the best of his recollection."
For a few moments Mrs. Smith was re
called to prove that slip possessed no gray
dress such as the woman wore who did
â¢â¢pond the night with Arlington nt the
Richmond, and it was then time to call
the mysterious hackdriver, by whom the
defense had promised to dear up all mat
ters concerning that night's escapade, but
Major McElrath frankly confessed "that
we haven't been able to get him."
On the other hand, however, Mrs. Sarah
Watklns of Snntn Barbara was called by
the prosecution and proved a :-tar. She
KÂ»ntjtiÂ«' that she formerly resirlÂ»d at 721
Sixteenth street, this city; thai Mis.
Smith lived with her. and that neither on
the night of April 11 nor any other night
during her sojourn there had Mrs. Smith
remained away from the house over
night. Every effort was made by the de
fense to break down Mrs. Wat kins-testim
ony, nut she proved unimpeachable and
the defense rested.
The case will be argued to the jury to
morrow morning, and it is likely that
Ai lington will know his fate before night.

Physician Declares the Present Su
perintendent Should Not Be Re
moved Because of the Un
fortunate Affair.
OAKLAND, Auk. 18.â Dr. J. J. McLean,
D.D.. has expressed his views regarding
the financial wrecking of the Associated
Charities. Dr. McLean was one of the
original members of the association and
has taken an active part in its affairs for
many years. He declares thai the pr<
distress is not in any sense the fault of
the superintendent. -Mrs. H. 1.. Kelly,
whose resignation the !;"ard of directors
acc< pted, to tak< effect In two weeks'
time.
l >r. McLean's statement contains the
following:
H is impossible to overestimate the
necessity for a competent and suitable
superintendent and secretary. The
early history of thi- organization v .. -
greatly hampered by frequ< nt i bang) â â¢.
for anything 1 i K * â¢ competency on the
part of such official expert knowledge
is essential. The early officials did
the best they could without that
knowledge, and while they were gain
ing the rudiments of it no "ix- among
them has ever made so much progresu
in this direction as has been made by
Mrs. Kelly.
I do not hesitati to say that the or
ganization has been far more effective
under thi j present superintendent"
than at any previous period; and that
because of the knowledge gained of
the general principles of charity or
ganizations and of the wide acquaint
ance with the needy class in our city.
Jt would be a great misfortune to
throw this away. Unless, therefore,
there exists, aside from anything In
the public knowWlse. the most Im
perative reason for a change, it would
be nothing less than a calamity to
place an entirely Inexperienced person
in charge of this most vital and im
portant work of superintending the
wist' administration of charities in our
city. The present financial embarrass
ment is of course to be regretted, nut
the general directorate and the other
officers of the organization must tÂ»
held much more responsible for this
condition of things than the superin
tendent, who is only the executive,
agent in carrying out the decisions of
tin directorate.

Captain Betbcder Denies the Killing.
Consul w. Y. IJoaiza of, the Argentine

lished in The Call a few days after his
vessel left this port to the effect that a
sailor had been killed aboard the ship by
the master-at-arms and the fact hidden,
from the United States officials. A copy
of The Call containing the story of the
killing was forwarded to Captain Bet

for a statement of the facts in the case.

after our leaving that port and not
during our stay there, as stated in the
newspapers. Kindly rectify.
CAPTAIN* BETBEDER.
it will be seen that while Captain Bet
beder admits the fact of the shooting he
seeks to solve himself from the conse

port the affair to the proper United States
authorities by denying that the sailor died
while the Presidents Sarmiento remained

L. M. King, superintendent of the Mer
chants' Association, has made thr follow
ing representations to his association for
obtaining and maintaining a better stir- ;
face for. our streets in San Francisco as
a result of investigations of methods in
successful use In the East:
Firstâ Admit asphalt, vitrified brick
and asphalted wood block pavement
und^r proper specifications and guar
antees In free competition with pres
ent j'.:\ ' merits.
Recordâ Change the spociflcnt lons
for bituminous rock paving so as to
require the use of a binder, and also
that the pavement shall bo rolled
while hot with steam rollers or the
proper weight to thoroughly compress
the pavement and insist upon 10-ypar
guarantees.
Third â Require that all business
streets when repaved with basalt
blocks shall have the blocks laid on
a concrete foundation and shall be
grouted with gravel and asphaltic
cement.
Fourthâ Arrange if possible so that
all pavements shall be guaranteed for i
ten yfars with good surety bonds.
Fifthâ That the work of repairing
the 1 asalt block find cobble streets
shall Im done systematically by divid
ing tho city into districts and keeping
men continually at work in each dis
trict and holding them responsible for I
the condition of thoir districts.
Sixthâ That, as is provided in the
new charter, the city itself undertake
the work of making repairs over j
trenches in the pavement made by
corporations and plumbers. This can
be done by fixing a scale of charges
and doing the work by day labor, or
by letting a contract to some one
party for a year, to make all such re
pairs at the prices bid. In either case
the party cutting the pavement should
deposit the cost of repairs in advance.

GAY GRAFT WILL CROWD THE BAY
Commodore Spreckels Issues Orders for a Grand
Naval Demonstration.
Governor Gage Declines to Declare a
State Holiday in Honor of Re
turning Soldiers.
THE GREAT HARBOR RECEPTION PARADE.
A LETTER will be handed by the boarding pilot to Captain
J. C. Reid, quartermaster in charge of the transport Sher
man, requesting him not to enter the harbor before 2:30
p.m. She will be met off Fort Point by a fleet of tugs, with
yachts in tow, all handsomely decorated. These craft will steam
toward her in two columns and circle around the stern of the
transport and come up the harbor abreast of her. one column on
each side. Outside of these columns, to the northeast and rear.
all other steam and sail vessels will take up their position.
The transport will be allowed by the quarantine officials to
eed to her anchorage off Folsom-street dock.
It is absolutely necessary, in view of the great number of
vessels which will be on the bay, that none except those as
signed a position in the line approach within 400 yards of the
transport, and in no event pass between the transport and the
city front. No communication will be allowed with the trans
port, as the work of the quarantine officials -would be de
layed and might prevent the landing of the troops on the follow
ing day.
The safety of the immense number of people who will be
afloat, and the fact that in the noise and excitement steam signals
cannot readily be distinguished, make it compulsory upon all
those in command of vessel-; to keep in a position of safety, and
relatives and friends must not expect to have their steamers
taken alongside of the transport.
A little common sen^e and exercise of judgment on the part
of all will insure the success of the event.
JOHN D. SPRECKELS.
Commodore Reception Fleet.
jjF the Instruction and details of the
great Instruction and carried out as
croat naval pan. do are carried out as
j| planned the affair will be one of the

, gently requested to keep not less than
400 yards to the north or east of the
line* of parade, or in the rear, and al
low ample room for the handling of
the towboats and yachts during their
maneuvers. Not only the general safe
ty demands this, but it Is necessary to
insure the pub an unobstructed view
from shore.
The vessels which have been as
signed positions in line will form same

will please give that point a wide
berth, thus avoiding confusion.

GOVERNOR GAGE DECLINES
TO HONOR THE SOLDIERS
I â¢ *,
"Z OVERNOR GAGK has declined to declare a legal holiday the day â¢*
â f /f~ ] upon which th people of the State will welcome their returning *
Â£ (( 17 sol(li " rs - He occupies the unenviable position of being the only man *
* \\J in California who does not enter into the spirit of the occasion. He +
* â¢> â^ states that he really wants to do something to honor the returning *â¢
* soldiers, but he cannot see his way cleat to comply with the wishes of the â¦
â¢Â¥â  people. Mr. Gage gives numerous excises for his actions, but none of them *
â Â¥ will be accepted under the elrcumstaiÂ»es. +
â Â¥â  "If I knew when the ship carrying cur troops would get here " says the â Â¥
â Â¥â  Governor, "I would be glad to make that day a State holiday but no one" â Â¥â 
â Â¥â  knows when they will arrive. Ido not want to make the mistake of naming *
â Â¥â  the wrong day and interfering with business all over the State to no purpose *
â Â¥â  In order to make the holiday effective notice would have to be given to â Â¥â 
â Â¥â  County Clerks all over the State, and there will be no opportunity to do this *
â Â¥â  when the ship is sighted. I am anxious to comply with the request of the **
â Â¥â  people of San Francisco who desire a legal holiday, but under the circum- â Â¥
â¢Â¥â  stances I cannot see my way clear In the matter and will have to decline" â¢Â¥â 
â¢* These excuses are puerile and flimsy. The holiday Is not desired until "*
â Â¥â  forty-eight hours after the transport is sighted, and possibly everybody "Â¥â 
* but Governor Gage knows that every section of the State can be reached â Â¥â 
* In that time through the medium of the press or the agency of the telegraph â Â¥â 
-fc wires. He could probably see his way clear in the matter If he gave more â Â¥â 
â * of his attention to his official duties and less to his efforts to land Dan Burns â Â¥â 
-* in the Senate. His actions will disappoint the people, but they have learned â Â¥â 
-* to expect just such things from Gage.-

FINAL MEETING OF THE
PARENTS' ASSOCIATION

imously:

SANTA ROSA TO BE
THE SHIP OF STATE
Senator Perkins Donates to the
Legislature the Use of One
of His Boats.
The members of the State Legislature
and Governor Gage and his party will sail
out to meet the California!] boys on the
good ship Santa Rosa; that was decided
last night, when enough legislators for
caucus purposes gathered at Assembly
man Cobb'a offices in the Parrot building
to discuss the state's share in the big re
ception to come next week.
"The patriotism shown by the people of
the city and county of San Francisco "
said Assemblyman Miller, "impressed me
with the idea that it would In- no more
than right and proper that the State tak^>
some hand in the reception to be given
Calfornla's heroes, bo yesterday I started
out to see what could be done.
Mr. Miller said he had talked it over
first with Chairman Cobb and others of
the San Francisco delegation and had
then gone to the steamship people to see
if a ship could not be got to carry State
officials. He went to Mr. Spreckels first
and Mr. Spreckels said he would have a
boat in from Australia on the 2. Â» th, to
which the State would he most welcome,
in rase the Sherman should not arrive be
fore that date. Then he went to Senator
Perkins, and the Senator tendered the use
of the Santa Rosa, which is due to ar
rive on the morning of the 23d. In case the
Sherman should arrive on the 22d, the
State of California was offered for that
date.
Governor Gage and Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neff will be invited to accompany
the party. Quarters will be â¢ secured at
either the Palace or Grand hotels, to be
j kept open during the coming week.
A motion was carried inviting the legis
lators of all the bay counties to come in
with the San Francisco delegation in the
arrangement of the reception, and invita
tions will be sent out to-day. .
The following committees were ap
pointed:

France from the Germans. You ask me
why I do not appeal to the public powers.
Alas! I haw written twice to the Finance
Minister, but got no reply. I wrote also
to the Prefect of the Seine, and he sent
me 10 francs. What was this for a de
