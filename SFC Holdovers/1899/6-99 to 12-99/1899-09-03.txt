THE PRESENT MONTH.
Two Steamers Loaded With Horses
and Recruits for the Regiments
in the riÂ«ld Depart for ~~
the Philippines,
At the rate with which recruits and ad
ditional regiments are being dispatched
to the Philippines General Otis will have i
near. Â£5,00u men under his orders when |
the fall campaign against Aguinaldo and j
his followers, about two months hence, >
begins. Two more transports got away |
yesterday â the Warren, with eight officers I
and 1y23 recruits, of whom 635 are volun
teers and 2SO are regulars, and the Leele- j
naw. with a big load of horses and mules.
Lieutenant B. H. Dorcy, Fourth Cavalry, j
was in charge of the latter, and Captain
T. W. Moore, Twenty-first Infantry, la
the senior officer in command on the War
ren. Another battalion of the Thirty-first
Volunteer Infantry arrived at the Pre- j
Bidio during the uay and joined the two
battalions of the same regiment that ar
rived the day before. Colonel James Sum
ner Pettit came in with the third bat
talion, which is commanded by Major
John McMahon and the following cum
pany officers: Company A. P. Stivers,

captain; Company C, L. C. Bennett, cap
tain; Company D, W. E. Cabell, captain.
Troop G, Sixth Cavalry, Captain West
commanding, arrived at the Presidio at
about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Other regiments are on their way to
San Frar.cisco and will be forwarded to
the Philippines with the least possible de- '
lay. They will not be kept at the Pre
sidio to indulge in target practice, as has I
heretofore been the case with the raw re- !
cruils, but will sail as soon as transports
can be made ready for them. According
to the schedule for the sailing of these
vessels but little time should bo lost and ,
practically all the reinforcements intend
ed for the army of General Otis should
be away from this port by the Ist of Oc
tober or before.
The Columbia will be ready to go on the
Sth, the Sherman on the 15th, the Belgian
King on the 15th, the Hancock toward the
end of the month, the Grant on the 17th,
the steamship Tacoma on the 17th, the
Sikh on the Lath, the George W. Elder on ,
the 12th. the Aztec lan animal ship; in :
two weeks, the Centennial in ten days and

Is expected In almost immediately, will be
fitted up to sail with the September fleet. |
The Glenogle is expected here on the yth ;
of September. The City of Rio will prob- I
ably be taken and also the Olympic,
which will be ready on October 1. The
Lennox, a large ship due here from the
Sound on the 20th, the British steamship
Victoria and the Acerican steamship Vic
toria are also under consideration. No
specific assignments have as yet been !
made to these transports, although it la J
understood that they will take the new i
volunteer regiments. The Thirty-first and i
Thirty-fourth Infantry have gone into
Camps Nos. 2 and 'i on the hill.
The volunteers are busy preparing for '.
mustering out. The medical inspection,
which has been in progress for several
days past, is proceeding rapidly and the I
muster rolls of the regiment now in camp J
are being prepared as fast as accuracy
will permit.
Major Rice of the California Heavy Ar
tillery has issued orders to the battalion
commanders to prefer charges against all
men under their command who fail to re- i
port for guard duty. J.here has been con
siderable laxity in this respect on the part !
di the soldiers lately anil the major is i
determined to put a stop to it.
A band of eighty horses intended for the ,
United States Cavalry, while being driven
from the cars at Third and Townsend
streets yesterday morning, became fright
ened at a donkey-engine on the water
front and stampeded. The cowboys in I
charge succeeded in rounding up all but i
twenty-three, that were captured by the
poundman and he-Id by the poundn I
until his claim of $4 a head should be j
liquidated. The matter was finally ar- ;
ranged after considerable telephoning and
the horses were safely corraled on the j
reservation.
First Lieutenant Ralph A. Clay, Four- j
teenth Infantry, who died at the general i
hospital on Wednesday night, was buried
In the United States Cemetery at the Pre
eidio yesterday afternoon with military!

Eistlng of a platoon of Battery O. Third
Artillery', commanded by Lieutenant.
Evans. â¢ .
Colonel O. F. Long, superintendent of
the army transport service here, has at
ast induced the War Department to adopt
the plan recommended by him for the
transportation of animals to the Philip
pines. Heretofore the animals were taken
&ff at Honolulu and rested, their trans
ports waiting In the harbor meanwhile.
This involved a great money los-s to the
3overnment, with ships that had been
chartered at so much a day lying id'.e.
According to the new plan, several an!-;
mal ships will ply between Honolulu and
Ban Francisco arid a similar number be
tween Honolulu and Manila, The ani- \
mals will be taken off at Honolulu and
rested there, while the transports return
.â mmedlately to San Francisco. Later they
will be taken on another transport to M i
nila A $0000 appropriation has b^en
granted for corrals and sheds at Hono
lulu where the horses will be thoroughly
rested before starting on their longer
Dcean journey. '
The following order, which is regarded
is of more than ordinary importance, was
* sued yesterday: , 4 .
The following regulations for- the
sanitary service at regimental and re
cruit camps at the Presidio of San
Francisco are announced and will be
strictly followed by all concerned:
J A commissioned medical officer of

medical inspector of the regimental
and recruit camps on the Presidio
Reservation with authority to exercise
general supervision over the medical
and sanitary conditions in these camps

order a)e properly executed.
2 The commanding olncer of each
regiment in camp will detail from his
command two sanitary inspectors, one
â  from the line, preferably a major, and
the other a medical officer, whose
daily duty it shall be jointly to inspect
the general police of the regimental
camp company quarters and streets,

Latest News of Our Volunteers
CALIFORNIA BOYS ARE BANQUETED
BY NATIVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
THE Native Sons and Native
Daughters entertained the brave
soldier boys of the First I
Regiment and the California
Heavy Artillery las: night at a ban
quet in the grand nave of the ferry build
ing .and never was a feast more thor
oughly enjoyed or more appreciated than
that, which was In all probability the last
that the gallant volunteers of the Golden
West will partake of as a body for many,
many months to come. The banquet was
a great undertaking, and Its unqualified
. success was entirely due to the untiring
efforts of the ladles, assisted by a few of
the sterner sex who were placed on the
committee and allowed to assume a cer
: tain measure of authority because of their
i supposed superior knowledge of the re
quirements of the occasion. The grand
nave is an ideal banquet hall, with but a
single fault, and that consists in Its lack
of acoustic properties.
This was in a measure overcome by
placing a band at either end. but. un
fortunately, the speeches could be heard
' only by those in the immediate vicinity of
the speakers. This was unfortunate in
1 that it prevented the soldiers from hear
: ing all the good things that were said of
them. But if they could not hear they
! could tee and appreciate as only a soldier
! ca.n the substantial part of the pro
gramme.
Just north of the main entrance to the
grand nave four tables had been arranged
in the form of a hollow square, and at
these tabli -â¢ ated the officers of
: the First California, of the artillery and
euch of the invited guests as could be ac
commodated. The other guests and the
soldiers were seated at long lines of
tables that reached from one end of the
: great nave to the other. Excellent music
was furnishrd by the bands of the Colo
-1 rado and Idaho regiments, both of which
generously volunteered their services.
There was a big crush of people, fully
i including those at table and the
hundre is of spectators, being in the build
ing. The presence of such a vast throng
seriously incommoded the work of the
committee and resulted in more or loss
unavoidable confusion. People would per

some one else and others could find no
s.ats to get into. Mrs. A. S. Townsend.
open-hearted liberality and grand
In behalf of the California \ olun
t^^rs have earned for her the title of
ler of the Regiment," was one of
those who were temporarily lost in the
shuffle. George Dryden found her stand
ing with her friend. Miss Rattigan, off
to one side, and quickly made a place for
them at a table, where if they could not
â¢h*Â» speeches they could at least see
the soldier boys enjoy themselves.
Among the invited guests who failed to
â¢ wf-re the Governor and Major Gen
eral Shafter. The latter was in Del Monte,
but no ono knew where the Governor was.
Frank H. Mills introduced Daniel A.
Ryan as tonstmaster, and the latter railed
upon Father McKinnon. chaplain of the
First California Regiment, for a prayer,
at the conclusion of which the work of
demolishing the chicken fricasse and other
appetizing dishes began.
The speechmaking did not b^gin until
nearly 9:30, but once started there was no
hitch in the programme. Toastmaster
Ryan started the ball rolling with a short
address, in which, among other things, he
said:
"The California volunteers constitute
the first army in the history of the United
- to go to a foreign territory for the
se of acquiring new possessions, and
I cull upon the people of California io
welcome thes-^ brave sons of California
to their country and their homes."
The Governor was down on the pro
gramme to respond to the "State of Cali
i'rnia." but as he was not present and
do representative Chief Justice
Bf-atty was called upon to speak to the
sentiment. 'â¢â¢â  did briefly.
"The First Regiment, California Volun
was the toast assigned to Colonel
Duboce. who saiil:
"It devolves upon mp to thank you on
bohalf of the California Volunteers for
cry handsome reception. It hardly
becomes me to say anything about the
â¢ nia regiment aft<-rall you have done
to show your appreciation for what the

sickness with their remarks aim ie
commendations in the premises. These
reports will be forwarded the same
day to the post commander through
the medical inspector of the camps.
3. A daily sick call will be held in
earh regiment and slight cases of Hi
ness treated in quarters or in the
regimental hospitals provided for that
purpose, but all serious cases, or those
likeiy to be ill for more than a few
days, will be sent to the United States
General Hospital. San FTancisco. The
senior surgeon of each regiment will
make timely requisition for all neces
sary medical and hospital supplies di
rect to the chief surgeon.
4. If any case of infectious disease
appears, the fact will be promptly re
ported to the medical inspector of
camps, who is authorized to make
proper disposition for its isolation and
care and every precaution will be
taken by the regimental medical offi
cers for thorough disinfection to guard
against the further spread of the dis
ease.
5. An ambulance with team fully
equipped will be assigned by the post
commander to each regimental camp
for service during the day. and one
such ambulance will be stationed at
some convenient place for the general
use of the camps in case of emergency
during the night from retreat to re
veille.
SAX FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1599.
volunteers from this State hare accom
plished, but I desire to refer to one thing
that we were continually hearing all the
time we were at the front in the Philip
pines, and that is the praise from the lips
of all the regiments from the East who
passed through San Francisco on their
way to the seat of war for the hospitable
welcome and . kind treatment they re
ceived from the people of this city.
"We have been sort of dazed the whola
week past and almost killed with kind
ness, and this banquet is a fitting finale
for a week of festivity, and our hearts
are overflowing with gratitude."
Major Frank S. Rice of the California
Heavy Artillery was called upon to re
spond to the toast "On the Firing Line,"
hut he stated in the beginning that he
was not qualified to speak on that sub
ject.
"We were only a little bunch of men
located by General Otis four miles from
nowhere," he said, "doing garrison duty
at Cavite. We were there 140 days, and
for sixty-nine^ days we were under fire.
But we did not go to the front; that
privilege was denied us. We were kept
down there, with a pestilential swamp all
around us. threatened with 'disease, with
Mauser bullets dropping continually in
our camp: but we won no glory, and we
claim none; but if the handful of men
who served under me for sixteen month?
fight the battle of life as nobly as they
did their duty in the swamps of the Phil
ippines they will not have fought in vain."
Mayor Phelan responded to "The Mu
nicipality."
"I know," he said, "you all understand
why we are here to-night. You all recall
not many months ago when the President
was appealing to the country for volun
teers to save the flag from threatened dis
grace and dishonor, how quick and en
thusiastic was the response in California.
You also remember the scenes at the de
parture of the First California Regiment.
Now they are back again and we are glad
to welcome them to their homes once
more."
Senator Perkins was the next speaker,
responding to the toast, "ThÂ« President. â¢
In part he said:
"There was nothing more magnificent
than the great spontaneous uprising of the
people of this great country when the call
to arms was issued by the President of
the United States and the splendid wis
dom and energy displayed by the chief
executive of 75.000 people in carrying on
the war to a successful consummation has
won the heartfelt admiration of soldiers
and civilians throughout the land. No
where in monarchical Europe will you
find such magnificent material for soldiers
as can be found in this country. There
they are all under the influence of a ruler
who bases his claim to authority on her
edity; here every American citizen is a
sovereign by virtue of that citizenship,
and they are luled by a man elected by
them and who is a citizen like themselves.
We are proud of our President and wÂ«
will stand by him in the future as in the
past."
Other toasts were responded to as fol
lows:
"The Native Sons," Lewis F .Byington;
"The Native Daughters." Henry Lun
stedt; "The College Soldier." David Starr
Jordan; "The Home of the Soldier," Hugh I
J. M. Isaac; "The United States," Julius
Kahn; and "The Ladies." Judge Dibble.

TELLS ABOUT
THE NAVAL
RESERVES?
[TVhen the Oregon Nayal Militia came aboard the Badger they imagined
that their cruise of one week was going to be a sort of pionic; all the work
would be done by the regulars and the reserves would have nothing to do but
look pretty and learn how to be Deweys. But they soon found out their
mistake when early in the morning the bugle sounded "bright work." Large
chunks of waste and a can of pomade were served out to f ach section, and they
were soon initiated into the mysteries of highly polished brasswork.
When night came each little sailor man dragged forth his hammock, and
then his troubles really commenced. How to get into the "darned thing" seemed
to cause him more uneasiness than had the wild salt billows which tossed the
Badger around on the unstable surface of the ocean. One of the Portland boys,
in a fever of thoughtfulness, had brought with him an adjustable stepladder, and
lo! the mystery was solved.
The decks of the Badger have been the scene of many events, grave and gay,
but this cruise with the Naval Militia carries off all the laurels lor amusing
Incidents. The arrival on board of Neptune and his suite, our Fourth of July
and subsequent entertainments are all thrown into the shade, and we have rea
son to ever remember the cruise of the Oregonians.]
SAT,5 AT, Dinnis! Hay yez heard how
thim ORegon Naval Preserves
sthood their cruise at say? No?
Well, yez havn't missed much, for
begorrah. they didn't sthand it at ail,
at all; they laid down to at for five
days, an' iv'ry wan ay thim knows now
phwat md ay the gunn th' ball kima
out ay. T'was this way, d'ye see: A
lot ay thim judes fr'm Portland an'
Astoria, t'inkin' they wud loike to do
tings loike Dewey, wint cut to say on
th' Badger, sayin' to thimsilves:
"Arrah, now, 'tis a foine picnic we do
be runnin' up aginst: th' mm ay th'
Badger will do all th' worruk, an* all
| we do Is sit around an' play phwist an'
I watch thim." But, say, Dinnis they
I see th' evil ay their thoughts now, as
! th' Chunday-school teachers say. Th'
i first noight at say It comminst to rain
I loike th' divil, an' along about tin
I o'clock be th' port watch, Ding! Dong!
i Dong! wint th' ship's bell. "Fire!" fire!"
| yelled wan ay th 1 judes. Up on deck
tumbled th' mm, some ay thim In paj
jiminies. or pwhativer ye call thimâ
thim things loike a bag around yer kar
cus; an' some ay thim hadn't turned in
at all because they'd left their step
ladders at home an' couldn't get into
their hammicks, an' others kirn flyin'
up with less clothes an thim than God
gave thim. 'Where's the foire?" wan
ay thim axed the offsur ay th' dick.
"Down in th' engine-room, ye fools!
Don't chez know th' diffrince bechune
a ship's bell an' a fire bell? Go below
agin!" An' thin th' ocean comminst
to get gay an' behave in a viry indacint
manner; manny ay th' judes had niver
be to say befoore, an' ay coorse their
wake, dilicate little stomix couldn't
sthand fur th' mixin' up they got; an'
say. Dinnis ! a cologney factory wud ay
been hailed wid delight. Ivery blissid
i ting thim judes hod insoide ay thim
! was schatthered all over th' ship, an'
j such sthuff that kirn up was corks.
I glass bottles, oats an' that sthuff called
grass; an' Oi belave, if Oi'm not mis
taken, I saw a pair ay gallusses comin'
out ay a jude's stomik. Th' nixt
marnin', bright an' early, ach wan ay
thim was given his first lisson in say
manship. A big chunk ay waste an' a
can ay Fritz's pomade was dealed out
to thim. an' they soon found out phy
th' brass worruk on th' Badger always
looked so bright. Say. Dinnis ! It was
a picnic to see thim judes poiishin' our
brass an' scrubbin' our decks. Says th'
! offsur ay th' deck: "Take off yer chocs
an' stockins!" an' av coorse th' judes did.
Well, begorra, Dinnis, widout a worrud
of a lie, we didn't need army sand
from the locker, for there was enough
that kirn from their fate to scrub her
down wid sand fer a month. I t'ink
Davy Jones must ay been stuck fer a
â week in th' mud that left their fate
from the Badger. After a phile some
felley played us a chune on a fish horn,
which meant that breakfast was reddy,
an' thin, be jabbers, ye shud ay seen
th' rush! Th' poor divils that dropped
their insides along th' deck didn't care
about goin' down below, but they were
hungry, havin' donated their last three
meals to th' mermaids an' Davy Jones;
: an' whin th<nr eyes lighted upon th'
I breakfast they guv wan long yell like a
! Commanche Injun. The offsur ay th'
i dick kern runnin' down th' stairs, an'
| says, says he: "Phwat talk hay yez;
I phwat'fl all this row about?" Says
they: "We want our breakfast!" Says
he: "Oh, yes does, does yez? D'ye think
I this a restaurant? Phwat's good enuff
fur Uncle Sam's sailormin is good
enough fur th' loikes ay ye judes! Is it
poi yez want?" With that he gives wan
kirk at a spit an' walks forrud.
Well, th' judes tuk a tumble an' fell on
to the hardtack, an' divil a worrud a

the determination of the young men- The
Pages II to 20
lie Oi tell ye did they say afther that
about th' grub, or lave army ay it afther
thim, hardtack an' all. Bimeby th' fel
ley wid th' fish horn gave us anither
chune, an' ivery wan ay us wint flyin'
up th' stairs to see what th' divil was
th' matther agin. They called it Giner'l
Quarters, but divil a giner'l cud Oi see;
but annyhow, all th' sailormin was
standin' in line, like they did th' night
Casey opened up th' new s'loon, an' all
th' offsurs had their swords on an' was
walkin' up an' down the deck, rubberin'
at th' capting an' s'iootin' him loike
he was th' Prisidint. "Go ahead wid
th" drill!" says th' capting. "Very good,
sur"' says th' Lootinint, an' wid that he
e'loots th' rist ay thim an' orders thim
to pass th' worrud for th' drills.
"Phvere are they?" says the offsurs.
"In th' fightin' top." says the capting.
Wid that th' Lootinint yells to wan ay
th' judes: "McLean, climb up thim
steps an' bring down thim drills:" The
jude says: "I can't sur; me fate's
webbed." Afther a phile, phin th' Loo
tinint had consulted wid th' capting an'
th' other offsurs, they kirn to th' con
clushun that it was rainin' too much
to have th' drillin' match outside, so th'
Judes was hustled downstairs agin. Th'
Lootinint gave th' order: "Go blow all
th' fourt' division!" an" wud ye b'lave
me, Dinnis, ivry blissid mother's son ay
th' fourt' division made a rush for th'
felley wid th' fish horn to hoy a blow
at th dom thing! Well, they got down
below afther a phile, an' th' division
offsurs dealed out a gunn to aich wan
ay thim an' lined thim up in a row
agin. "'Tinshur.:" says th' offsur.
Each wan ay thim looked at his fate to
see they were both there. "'Prisint
harms'." says he agin. Kaeh jude sail
orman stippert up an' prig in ted th 1 off
sur wid his gunn, an' if th' poor divil
hod twinty hands he cud not ay
grabbed thim fast enough. Say, Dinnis.
d'ye moind th' toime th' haythin at
Samoa surrindid their gunns to us?
â Well, it wus just th' same wid these
Judes. They cudn't give thim up fast
enuff. Bomby th' offsur ay th' deck
kirn along, an' seem' how things was,
he says, says he: "Choulder harms:"
They got this right, so to jolly thim
up a bit, he says: "Arrah, mm, it's
splindid ye'r doin'. Put it on yer other
choulder! It's foine sojersailors yell
be makin' some day twinty cinturles
hince!" Wan ay th' jude? was tryin'
to sneak out ay th' drillin' match, an'
was walking off toward th' gallery: th Q
capting spied him an' sung nut: "'Hey,
there, you! Where d'ye b'long? Kirn
back here!" The jude kep on walkin'
an' said: ""It's airoight, capting. I be
long in Aastoria. an' am goin' to
walk home." He thought he end
walk on th' wather. Afther th' drill
was over th' mm were givin a rist
for about tin minits; thin th' felley wid
the fish horn played a chune an' Giner'l
Quarters kirn along agin. It's a dom
funny thing, Dinnis, that niver a wan
ay us iver got a squint ay th' giner'l,
but sivin tim^s ivry day for five days
th' Giner'l was on hoard th' Badger, an'
th' poor judes didn't have a chanst for
a dacint smoke. But they're home agin
now, Dinnis, an' glad they are. Lavin'
all jokes asoide. thim ORegon mm are
all right. Nixt week the San Francisco
lads will come aboard for a chanst. ay
coorse we expect betther worruk from
thim, as they have hod more experience
than th' O'Regons. But Oi don't belave
the San Francisco byes can do army
betther shootin' wid a foive-inch gunn
than th' O'Regons did. Wan ay thim
named Leery smashed the tar gate all
to smithereens th' first rattle out ay th*
box, an' the capting hod to put out a
new wan for th' other felleys; an', be
jabbers, they'd no sooner got out th'
new tar gate whin, Bing! wan ay thim
Castorians hit it a smash, an' I b'lave
it's goin' yit! I b'lave he thot he wuz
out In th' woods huntin' thim squirls
wid th' long shaggy tails.

A MILLION-DOLLAR BEDROOM.
Gorgeous Sleeping Apartment of Lud

"Half way between Munich and Salz
burg is the third castleâ Herrenchiemseeâ
built by Ludwig II," writes Professor J.
H. Gore in the Ladies' Home Journal.
"This groat structure is incomplete, for
tunately for already overtaxed Bavaria,
for no one could surmise what its cost
would have been. One room aloneâ the re
nowned !>ed chamberâ could not be dupli
cated for less than a million dollars. The
vaulted ceiling is one great allegorical
painting, the rounded cornice is covered
with a score of richly framed mural paint
ings, the walls ar. panels of hammer, rl
gold of intricate designs, and even the
floor is of a marvelous pattern. The only
suggestion of the purpose of this wonder
ful room is the $6o.i>;.ii in <l. with its canopy
more magnificent than any that covt rs ii
regal throne. In t>ie gorgeous dining
room he had erected a disappearing I
which dropped through the floor when :i
course was finished, and in its place came
up another, set ami served. He desired
this so that the servants would be un
necessary in the room and the most secret
state matters could be discussed in safety.
Many people sought in vain to see the
famous room at Herrenchiemsee. Once
an actress pleased Ludwig ho much by
her recitation that she thought it a:i op
portune moment to request permission to
s r e his *most poetic bed chamber.' She
was coolly dismissed for her effrontery,
and the servants were ordered to fumi
gate the room in which she had been re
ceived."
"I tell you, it's no use to hang your
head if you. fire guilty."

appearance of. the Pallors was the signal
for loud and continued cheering.
As the colors were presented every hat
waS doffed and as the sweet strains of the

ing was continued. At the conclusion of
the melody A. Redecker, president of the
vereih stepped forward and. after saluting
the officers and men welcomed them in
the name of the society. He concluded
his remarks by calling for three cheers
for the German Emperor and the navy
and they were ftlven with a will.
The sin"ing section of the Ycrein and

NOVEL INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITION
OPENS AT MECHANICS' PAVILION
THE thirty-first industrial exposi- 1
tion of the Mechanics' Institute j
opened last night under conditions '
that promise to make it even more j
successful than any of its prede- |
1 cessors. The Mechanics' Pavilion was
crowded and made its prettiest appear- ,
;im-f. The Inaugural exercises were brief, i
I'-ennett's band played an overture, Presi- I
dent Denicke of the institute welcomed !
1 the crowd present, Mayor Phelan made a â 
short address in which he said pome nice :
i things about the arts of peace of which :
his surroundings reminded him; a lady j
. cornetist tongued a rattling medley, the |
Knickerbocker yuartet sang and the '
band played on.
In spito of the fact that some of the
| exhibitors were a little tardy in getting
i their displays together, by reason, It was
j explained, of the events crowding on the
return of the California volunteers, the '
i exhibits were many and highly creditable j
i nnd not a few of them were decidedly j
novel. The management promises to have
everything in place for the crowds ex- |
peeled Monday afternoon and evening.
P< ople long familiar with the Interior of j
the Pavilion would have been puzzled j
lnst night to recognize It. Under the
hands of the decorators it had undergone
a wonderful transformation. Everything !
beautiful and bright and gay. Ar

memorable occasion. The effects of his
good time began to assert Itself yesterday
and to relieve his pain he went to a drug-
Btore, corner of Market street and Van

chloral.

hurriedly called in an officer, who had u.e

doctors worked over him for nearly an
hour ;ind managed to bring their patient

terns shed their many-colored refulgence
over the scene and untold incandeseents
brilliantly liprht^d the remotest corner of
the vast structure. Into this splendid
setting the exhibitors had placed their
best products, and the result was highly
praiseworthy.
As in all expositions, so in this. thÂ°rÂ°
are pome things that are not new, but
they are few. The tish display, for in-
Btahce under the south gallery, which.
dt spite the fact that sameness can be al
leged against it, is one of the attractions
tliat appeals to everybody. Then there
is the carriage display, which, as a rule.
Is only interesting to the rich "who ride
in chaises." Last night, however. It was
different, a spanking new automobile lend
ing a novelty to the display that marked
it as being iip to date.
Great towers of baking powder and
coffee, pyramids of jelly, pavilions of per
fumery " tea houses, candy kiosks and
natty "looking restaurants took up the re
mainder of the usual displayâ all, how
ever being more or less unusually taste
ful and fetching. An exposition with only
these would be attractive, but the one
offered this year by the trustees of the
institute is far beyond such a necessity.
TRAVELERS' DAY
AT THE STATE FAIR
BIG PREPARATIONS UNDER
WAY FOR THE EVENT.
Commercial Men at the Capital Unan
imously Agree to Close Their
Places of Business for tho
Occasion.
"Commercial Travelers' day" at thÂ»
State Fair on September 8 promises to be
one of the memorable events of the year
at the capital. - At a meeting oX the
Wholesale Merchants' and Manufacturers'
Association last month it was decided that
every member of the organization should
close his place of business in honor of the
day set apart for the commercial travel
ers. The action of these two leading mu
nicipal bodies has resulted in bajiks, gro
cery stores, and in fact business houses of
every kind and description following their
example.
Five thousand invitations have been Is
sued by the Sacramento Council of the
United Commercial Travelers' Associa
tion and from the reports received by the
members of that organization commercial
and business nvn throughout the State
will Journey to Sacramento to participate
in the festivities.
Fred L. Martin. 11. A. Bell, John F. Ol
sen, B. Richardson and Ed Lynn of the
committee of arrangements v.-pre In the
city last night and attended the meeting
of Golden Gate Council of the United
Commercial Travelers' Association. A cor
dial invitation was extended to the mini
bers of that society, and through it to all
traveling men, whether affiliated or not,
to visit Sacramento on the Bth of Septem
ber and swell the attendance. A large
number of neatly printed invitations, ad
dressed to the wives and daughters of the
members, were left with the members for
distribution.
The committees having the day In
charge are leaving no stone unturned to
make it a memorable one in the annals
of the State Fair. ThÂ«Â» folfowing pro
gramme has been carefully arranged f.ir
the day, and its varied character will un
doubtedly give pleasure to everybody. It
Is as follows:
10 a. m. â Baseball at Agricultural Park;
Sacramento Council vs. San Fran
cisco Council. Come and see
us beat San Francisco.
1 p. m. â All traveling men to meet at hall,
Ninth and J streets, and headed by

Balloting for your favorite traveling man.
It has two novelties, each of which Is a
whole show In itself. The first of these,
as being the most novel, is the Yo-Ki-A
Indian village. The second is the Fi!<
pino troup, a glimpse of which has al
ready been had by the people of San
Fran Cisco.
The Yo-Ki-A village is a small one. It
has at present six inhabitants. Chief oim
and two sub-chiefs, two squaws and a
dusky squawlet of a dozen years or so.
It set ur its single tepee of tules yester
day morning under the north gallery of
the Pavilion, cut it off with a picket
fence, and last night its six inhabitants
were showing the white men and women
how to extract an existence close to the
heart of nature. Around wnat appeared
to be a log fire, but which, owing to the
stringency of the fire ordinances, was
merely a' gas stove masquerading behind
two large logs, the half dozen aborigines
grouped themselves, and set about the
labors that occupy them at their home In
Mendocino County. As a mark of his
dignity in the tribe, of which he is medi
cine nian as well as chief. Chief Jim wore
across his aged shoulders a robe made of
the untanned skin of a spotted doe. He
labored industriously on the shaft of a
bear spear, for which another of the
bucks was making a head of obsidian,
wearing away the flinty rock on a fiat
stone and seeming to enjoy the tedious
process. The third buck was busy mend
ing a fish net.
The elder squaw was busily engaged
pounding acorns in a mortar into the
required fineness for bread. This method,
while it possesses novelty for the ladles
of San Francisco, will never become pop
ular. It is too much like earning one's
bread by the sweat of one's brow. Ine
elder squaw of the Yo-Ki-A tribe will un
doubtedly enjoy a monopoly of this in
dustry while in this city. The other squaw
of the village, who has sat as a mod^l
more than once for a picture from the
brush of Grace Hudson, put in the even-
Ing making baskets. She had as an un
derstudy the little Indian maiden.
Crowds surrounded the paling that In
closed the village, unaware that a gas
stove lurked in the midst of this scene
of savagery as they listened to the tale
of Trustee Healy of the institute, who
had camped four years on the trail of
this Indian village beforÂ« he finally
booked it for the Institute.
The Filipinos were a little backward
last night with their village, although
Open to all, so make your choice.
Modest Man.
(And you all know him.) Prize, choice
of any hat In Fred Trout's hat store.
Handsome Man.
(Now do your guessing.) Prize, choice of
cane or umbrella in Albert Klkus'
clothing store â the umbrella guar
anteed to keep off the wet.
The Slim Man will also get n prize.
The Popular Man will also get something.
The Fat Man, too, will not be overlooked.
10:30 p. m. "Evening." â Badger fight; and
a noted and vicious bulldog has
been scoured. This, of course,
is for men only.
After all this, you won't be sorry you
came.

decked out, as they will be'lore to-morrow

LETTER-CARRIERS WILL MEET
IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA
The Leading Officers of the National Association.
THE first session of the convention of the National Association of Letter-Carriers in the United States will be
held in the city of Scranttfn, Pa_. on Tuesday next. It promises to be the largest assemblage of the carriers of
Uncle Sam's mail that has ever assembled. California, particularly San Francisco, is honored in having on the
executive board the second officer, Conrad Treiber of this city, who is the vice president. The other officers are
John N. Parsons of New York City, president; Edward J. Caiuwell of Washington, D. C, secretary, and M. J.
Connors of Chicago, treasurer.
The association at this time is composed of 653 branches, representing that number of cities, with an aggregate mem
bership of more than 16,000. It has protective and insurance features. Since it was organized in Milwaukee in IS&9. it has
paid out In death benefits alone, more than {300,000. Following the adjournment of the previous convention In Toledo,
Ohio, last year, forty-one new branches were instituted and forty-four delinquents were reinstated. At the first annual
convection held In Boston In 1890 but fifty cities were represented.
One of the principal matters to be brought up at this session will be the preparation of a bill that is to be pre
sented at the next session of Congress, having for its purpose the fixing of the maximum salary of carriers at SI2JO a year.

It was generally supposed that the suit

yesterday that it has not yet reached
that stage.
"If Mr. Dalton believes he has a right
to those commissions." said Mr. Coigan.
"I do not blame him for trying to collect

not see where he has the slightest legal

are his. I have had the statute construed
for me by several attorneys and the At

"I: Is but a small matter, a little over

to withhold payment of the second. It
is to be regretted that there is a differ

whence he escaped.
Cheeseman, It appears rmm latest ac

ALAMEDA NOT
VET SAFE FROM
THE EQUALIZERS
May Be Brought Up
on Tuesday.
DALTON'S FIGURES ARE HIGH
FOUR, TIMES HIGHER THAN SAC-
RAMENTO.
Chief Deputy Robinson Says That a
Comparison With Other Counties
Would Justify a Decrease by
the State Board.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
DOS Broadway. Sept. 2.
It is not altogether improbable that the
State Board of Equalization may spring
some surprises at its meeting next Tues
day. Last night the members could not
agree regarding the raising of the assess
ments of various counties, but there were
always three votes to raise Alameda 5 or
jlO per cent. "When Mr. Beamer positively
objected to having any county in his dis
trict raised, Messrs. Lou Crown and To
land refused to vote to raise any of the
counties, and there the matter was left.
Next Tuesday the State board will hold
its final meeting. One of the Equalizers
says that the assessments of certain
counties may be reconsidered, and that if
this be done Alameda will certainly be
one of these counties.
Th- Equalizers seemed to be of the opin
ion that Alameda should be subjected to a
small raise in order to equalize it with
San Francisco, which has been raised
many millions. The opinion prevailed that
Alanieda, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara Men
docino, Glenn and a few other counties
should be raised, but while some members
of the board favored raising counties in
other members' districts, they objected
to such a procedure in their own. This '
failure to agree resulted in all counties
not already passed upon being left at
their Assessors' figures.
A comparison of the assessments of Ala- ;
meda with other counties brought out i
some peculiar facts. In Sacramento city |
the most valuable property is assessed for
$320 a front toot. The most valuable prop- '
erty in Oakland reaches $1100 per front
foot, and experts declare that, if any
thing, a comparison of values favors Sac
ramento. Compared with Los Angeles,
Alameda shows almost as much improve
ment Luring the past two years.
Chief Deputy Assessor Robinson, who
appeared before the State board, says be
docs not believe any effort will be made
-to incrc-ase this county. "When I heard
some of the figures of other counties." ]
says Mr. Robinson, "I was surprised, and j
now I believe that much of the property i
of Alameda County is still over-assessed. |
There is no property in the city of Oak- j
land more valuable than the very best
property in Sacramento, and yet we have
several blocks of property assessed nearly i
double the amount assessed by Sacra
mento. This is surely not right, and there i
is need of a change somewhere. I think i
Alameda'- 5 assessment is as fair as any
assessment could be. We have taken into
consideration everything that could help
us in arriving at intelligent values, and
have not depended upon any particular
mortgage or deed of trust or considera
tion in a deed or appraisement. We have j
paid attention to all these, and also to the
earning capacity of properties, and I have
no hesitation in saying that no Assessor's
office could have acted more justly or i
more impartially."

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

The exclusive publication in this m mi

â¢ - - â¢ ng the many realty
rs who h:r â  â  . sites to the

declined to supply
further information.
In this evenings edition of his paper,
lirer, is printed the following:
>- 4
âº From many points of view it was -4
âº- a rather interesting session. A note- 4
âº worthy point was the expose of cer- 4
âº tain interested realty speculators to 4
âº secure newspaper backing to assist -4
X them In their efforts to have the -4
âº Postofflce Department at Washing- 4
âº ton select a particular lite for the -4
y new Federal building for Oakland 4
*â  authorized at the last session of -4
âº Congress. 4
âº It was during the discussion mci- 4
âºâ¢ dental to those postoffi â¢â <.â  sites 4
- that the State board was informed 4
y by the manager of a local paper 4
âº that he had been offered $3000 if he 4
âº would assist in selling a certain site -4
âº to the Government. This Informa- -4
âº tion took the pins from under -4
âº Bramer's argument for fair valua- 4
âº tions, for it was conceded that if a 4
âºâ  man could afford to pay such a 4
>â¢ sum for being assisted in his fight, 4
>â  a great deal more than a fair valu- 4
âº ation had been placed on the prop- -4.
âº erty.
âº -â¦
This is not the first story that has been
published in regard to the selection of a
postofflce site. a few weeks ago Colonel
John P. Irish visited Washing-ton, and a
San Francisco newspaper published a
story to the effect that th-? colonel was in
the feast in the interest of the Centennial
block owners. This story was at once
positively refuted by Treasury Agent Rob
erts, who declared that in his report to
the Treasury Department not even men
tion had been made of the Centennial
property.
All kinds of rumors can be heard re
garding influences supposed to be at work
to sell the Government a piece of prop
erty for about twice its actual value, but
not until Mr. Daniels made his positive
statement before the State Board of
Equalization was anything definite known.
This evening Mr. Daniels said he had no
more information to impart other than
that the party who wished to secure his
co-operation had decided not to offer his
property to the Government. "And. in
deed,' 1 added â â¢. Daniels, "I do not think
that the locality could possibly have been
cnosen in any event."
These developments will undoubtedly
cause the Government agent to very care
fully examine into the actual value of any
piece of property he may decide to recom
mend for purchase by the United States
Government

MERRY DISPUTE
OVER THE WILL
OF GOCHNAUER
Widow Slaps at Pub
lic Administrator.
A QUEER OPPOSITION FILED
TAPPAN TURNS LOOSE HOWIT-
ZER OF HUMOR.
JCrs. Gochnauer Declares It's None of
Hawes" Business to Meddle in
the Estate cf Her Deceased
Husband.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
908 Broadway, Sept. a
The petition for letters of administra
tion on the estate of Philip Goehnauer,
who died supposedly intestate at his home
in Alaineda on Augrust 16 last, Sled by
Public Administrator ii. C. Hawes I
through his attorneys. Snook & Church, !
has stirred up a hornet's nest apparently,
and to-day a most peculiar opposition to
the proceedings taken was hied by the
widow, Mrs. Florence A. Gochnauer !
through her attorney, R. B. Tappan.
in the opposition Attorney Tappan turns i
loose bis howitzer of long-suppressed
humor, mingled with Indignation, upon
the Public Administrator tor nosing in
business that he claims doÂ« - not concern
him. The objections to this county offi
cial's steps are set forth in the opposition
as follows:
That the Public Administrator has
no legal right to interfere with the es
tate of said deceased, smce dtcea.sed
left him surviving a low. The Pub
lic Administrator is as much bound by
law as any citizen of this common
wealth is and he is bound to respect
section 1301 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure of said State, which provides
that if a person named in a will as
executor neglects for thirty days to
file the will and petition for Its pro
bate he may be held to have renounce*!
his right to letters. Whether or not
deceased left a will Is of no concern to
the Public Administrator, for deceased
left him surviving a widow, who has a
right to attend to her own business
without outside interference.
It had been stated that the deceased left
a widow and two children surviving him :
and residing near the Catalina Islands, ,
and concerning this statement the opposi- |
tion recites:
The widow of deceased denies that i
she eevr saw the island of Catalina,
but admits that she has seen what is
known "as Goat Island; that did she
reside at the island of Catalina she
would not be disqualified from attend
ing to her business in connection with
this estate, for the widow believes the
said island to be within the jurisdic
tion of this court.
The widow further, through the in
strumentality of Attorney Tappan's
howitzer, alleges "that she has resided
in one house in Alameda continuously
for twenty years last past, and her
residence is as well known in her
neighborhood as is the residence of the
Public Administrator in his neighbor
hood and if the Public Administrator
would have expended 10 cents for far
fare he would have learned the facts
about the family of deceased and
hence he would not have been obliged
to file a petition for letters herein in
which he sets forth that he knows only
that deceased is dead."
The Widow Gochnauer asks that this |
court throw the proceedings out of
court "because of the unreasonable
interference of the Public Administra
tor- that when she gets good and ready
âa.-i the law permitsâ she may petition
this court for letters and to take such
steos as she may be advised."
" FLORENCE A. GOCHNAUER.
Widow of deceased, of sound mind,
qualified to attend to her own affairs.
Public Administrator Hawes declares
that he used no undue haste in applying
for letters on August 26. and that he pro
poses his petition shall be heard in court
unless a will is filed. If there is a will he
is at a loss to account for the delay in its
I

UDAyCITILSI J
THE BERKELEY
FRANCHISES MAY
CAUSE TROUBLE
Proposed Moving of
Local Depots.
RESIDENTS WILL OBJECT
MANY BUSINESS INTERESTS
THREATENED.
Grave Consequences Likely to Follow
if the Berkeley and Dwight Way
Stations Are Finally
Abandoned.
BERKELEY. Sept. The Southern
Pacific Railway Company and the resi
dents of the university town are likely to
soon come to a serious clash. It promises
to be the old story of monopoly coming
in the guise of benefaction and then
abusing the confidence reposed in it.
A month afro C. P. Huntington applied
to the city for two valuable franchises.
He proposed to extend the Telegraph
avenue line now connecting Oakland and
Berkeley so as to cover the best part of
the city's residence and business sections.
The line waa to leave Telegraph avenue,
run down Bancroft way to - tattuck av
enue and along SJiattueK avenue to North
Berkeley. At the time of application for
these privileges some distrust as to the
railway company's motives was enter
tained, but they had no weight with the
Board of Trustees. That body granted
what was asked for within the shortest
time allowed by law.
It now appears that this sudden move
on the part of the Southern Pacific, so
eagerly forwarded by the City Fathers, is
but -..-. step in the direction of a precon
ceived plan whereby the whole traffic of
the university town is to be completely
revolutlonizt 1 without consulting the
wishes of the residents. Having given
away their franchise, the city is beginning
to see through the erne which it is
proposed to force- upon it.
The railway company's plan is said to
be as follows: It will first of all do way
entirely with the depot now known as
Berkeley station, on Shattuck avenue, be
tween Center street and University av
i enue. A new depot will be constructed
: somewhere near the point where Bancroft
way runs into Shattuck avenue. This new
depot will be the terminus of the local
train connecting Berkeley with the Oak
land mole. Traffic between the new sta
tion and North Berkeley will be carried
on by means of the new electric line along
Shattuck avenue, for which the franchise
has just been granted, the new station
being the" point of transfer.
The second change looks toward doing
away altogether with what is known as
Dwight-way station at the point whera
Dwight way crosses Shattuck avenue.
This will leave no stopping place for the
local train between Ash by avenue and the
new station to be built near Bancroft way.
It is asserted that no more serious blow
to the business portion of the town than
this could have been thought of. Berke
ley has but two small business centers
one near Berkeley Station, the other near
Dwight-way Station. Both depend for
their business largely upon the presence
of the two railway depots. The contem
plated change on the part of the Southern
Pacific will have for its principal -iff*
a shifting of the trade center of the town
for a distance of several blocks. It means
that the best business property of the
city will shift from its present location
to the region of Bancroft way and Shat
tuck avenue. The dealers already estab
lished in the neighborhood of Center
street and Stanford place are not slow to
see the imminence of the danger which
will threaten their prospects and they
will fight the move, to the end.
The removal of Dwight-way station
will fall heavily upon the merchants of
that district as well as upon the exten
sive residence section of the city, which
extends for some eight or ten blocks up
Dwight-way and on the streets surround
ing.
The first step taken by the Southern
Pacific in attlpnpting to carry out this
scheme will be the signal for a lively con
troversy between the city and the rail
way monopoly.

RELIC OF MISSION DAYS.
Monterey Man Finds an Ancient
Pair of Shoes.
MONTEREY, Sept. Lâ V. Canet, who
occupies the old Girardin homestead on
Houston street, while ransacking an un
uÂ»( d closet in the house, came upon a
pair of shoes that were so odd that hid
curiosity â was at once aroused and he ex
amined them carefully.
They are made of rawhide, the work
manship b>i:i^ r extremely crude, and are
apparently very old. The poles are half
an Inch thick, and in order to curve the
uppers in the proper shape small cuts
were made on the surface of the rawhide.
Those who have seen the shoes say thore
is no doubt that they were made by one
of the Mission Indians.
The shi.os are like some that have de-
I scendeu from father to son since Mission
i days, only the workmanship is very much
more r-rude, thus showing them to be
nui'-h older.
Mr. Canet found the shoes hidden away
: bo hind a vast accumulation of other ar
tlcles, which sc-emed not to have been
I moved for fifty years or more, so thickly
were they covered with the dust and cob
; webs of time, and it is believed the shoes
; were cast off by some oneâ probably one
j of the Indian peons attached to the house
| hnld of some former occupant of the old
dwelling.
JURY FAILS TO AGREE.
Unable to Convict a Banker Who
Failed to Turn Over Money.
CHICAGO. Sept. 2.â The jury sitting In
the case of Edward S. Drover, the former
prominent banker, charged with failing 1
to turn over to his successor as treasurer !
of the West Park Board $319,000 of the j
board's funds, to-day announced that they
could not agr-^e upon a verdict.
Dreyer was in IR% treasurer of the West
Park Board and senior member of the
banking linn of E. S. Dreyer & Co. With i
the crash of the National Bank of Illinois
numerous smaller institutions, among
them Dreyer & Co., went under. Dreyer !
had deposited the board funds in the I
National Bank of Illinois, and his defense !
was that the loss of the money was
through no fault of his.
Discredits Murder Theory.
SANTA ROSA. S"pt 2.â Coroner Pierce
of Sonoma County stated this afternoon
that the man Gianzini, the section hand

theory that murder was committed. When
he read the dispatch from San Raiael
that the man's neck was broken when
the body was taken there for burial the
Coroner" said when he examined the body
the neck was not broken.

EXPLORING THE
WILDS OF ALASKA
Glenn Party Maps Out
New Trails.
Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Sept. 2.â Some details of
the progress made by the Glenfi mili
tary exploring party in the Cook Inlet
and Shushitna River country, Alaska,
have been brought here by Quarter
master's Clerk P. H. Kuhn.
Unexpected success was achieved by
the expedition, he reports, as far as its
general purposes went. The Shushitna
has been demonstrated to be navigable
for a distance of over 150 miles from
Its mouth, with a minimum depth of
water of three feet. Two of its branches
were ascended and found to be naviga
ble for ordinary river boats of compar
atively light draught.
In a general way the exploration of
the interior of the country is progress
ing favorably, four parties being now
on their way to their several destina
tions.
Before Kuhn left Tynook the last of
the four parties detailed by Captain
Glenn to penetrate the interior had got
ten safely over the divide. One party
was led by Lieutenant J. A. Herron,
with nine men and Indian guides,
bound for the mouth of the Tanana.
The object of this expedition, like
others, was to discover trails leading
to the interior. Lieutenant Herron's
Indian guides deserted when he crossed \
the divide, but he will be able to reach |
his objective point.
Another parly of eight, In command
of J. L. Van Schoonover, is well on the
ivaj; to Circle City and should get
through in good season.
Still another party, In charge of
which is Topographer C. FJ. Griffith, is
working over the divide to Eagle City
and mapping out a new trail for pros
pectors.
Finally an expedition was prepared
which was instructed to discover a
practical route for a trail from Knik
Arm, on Cook Inlet, to Portage Bfiy, on
Prince William Sound. This party has
a great deal of work in sight, the coun
try being rough In the extreme and
filled with glaciers.
There are plenty of destitute miners
still in the Copper River country and
some even In the Cook Inlet district.
DECIDES CRANES GULCH
MINES ARE PLACERS
Judge Bennett Files an Opinion in
the Famous Georgetown
Suit.
PLACERVILLE, Sept. 2.â A decision
I was handed down to-day by Judge M.
P. Bennett in the Superior Court in the
| famous Cranes Gulch mining case, in
volving the title of the Cranes Gulch j
placer mine near Georgetown, in this j
county. The decision is of interest to
every miner on the coast, as the case
presented many new and novel princi
ples in mining law.
Cranes Gulch was patented as a plac
er mining claim in 1572 by Messrs. Wat
son and Whitesides, who afterward
sold it to the California Water and
Mining Company. The claim for years
was worked as a hydraulic placer mine.
In May, 1837, Joseph and Frank.
â  Sherrer and Clifford Cheek of George
i town located the ground as a quartz-
I mining claim, and, sinking a shaft,
were richly rewarded, finding: numer-
I ous seams of quartz rich in gold. The
defendant, the California Water and
; Mining Company, enjoined the miners
! claiming title under their placer patent.
' The injunction to-day was made per
; petual. Judge Bennett holding that the
i ground was placer and the presence of j
â  the quartz seams did not constitute the
| mine a quartz mine within the meaning
!of the Federal statute relating to
mines.
The case was tried in March last and
was one of the most stubbornly con
tested mining cases ever tried in the
courts of 'his county. Leading ex
perts testified in the case, Hon. George
K. Williams and R. W. Wltmer of this
: city representing the corporation plain
tiff and Tabor & Tabor and J. M. Ful
weiler of Auburn the defendants. The
case will be appealed to the Supreme
Court.
GREAT BRITAIN MAKES
IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS
An Agreement as to the Alaskan
Boundary Line May Soon Be
Reached.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2.â lmportant con
cessions have been made by Great Britain,
acting for Canada, in the matter of the
Alaskan boundary dispute. This encour
ages the belief that an agreement for the
establishment of a temporary boundary
line may be reached next week.
The officials are reticent concerning' the
character of these concessions, but it is
understood that in the final draft of the
t modus Vivendi under consideration no pro
vision will be made for a free port on tho
: Lynn canal for Canada. It seems to be
i the general Impression that In the per
! manent arrangement for the settlement of
I the dispute it will be agreed that Great
Britain shall have a port on Lynn canal
â under lease from this government, per
haps for ninety-nine years, no matter how
the other points of the controversy may
be settled.
Although Canada has apparently
changed her attitude and agreed to make
tho concessions which Great Britain has
advanced, It may lie stated that Secretary
Hay has not withdrawn from the position
assumed by this Government that the
boundary line be placed to the northward
of the village of Kluckwan. No matter
whether the dispute is temporarily set-
I tled or not, this Government thinks that
1 it would not do to relinquish a foot of ter
ritory which Is undoubtedly American,
and Great Britain fully understands the
purpose of the United States not to with
draw.
Secretary Hay will thoroughly discuss
the Alaska question to-morrow or Mon
i day with the President and determine the
! attitude of the United States, now that
j there is a prospect of a temporary set
! tlement, at least, of the boundary contro
versy.

WEARY TRAMP FROM
SAN ROQUE PLACERS
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2.â Among 1 the
returning victims from the San Rogue
placer digpings in Lower California are
Mr. and Mrs. W. N. Smith of Denver,
who reached this city to-day on their
return trip, after having walked 550
miles in their struggle to get back to
civilization, and who are now at the
Linwood Hotel.
When the couple left Denver they had
several hundred dollars, but the ex
penses of the trip were so great that
when they discovered the trap into
which they had been led by false re
ports which came from the peninsula
they were not prepared to get out in
proper shape, and the long, hard tramp
was forced upon them. For mile after
mile, day after day, they struggled
against all manner of hardships, in a
country almost inconceivably hot and
desolate, until their feet were swollen
and blistered and every step caused
them agony.
Mr. Smith is an old miner, but he de
clares that he has never encountered
such hardships as those of Lower Cali
fornia, which he thinks is more for
bidding than the Klondike and lacks the
wealth of the latter country.
NEGRO SUFFRAGE
ENDANGERED
Bitter Political Fight Is
Waged.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 2.â The Jour
nal this afternoon publishes a sensa
tional story from its special correspond
ent, who has recently been in North
Carolina, on the campaign commenced
there by the white people, both Demo
crats and Republicans, to disenfran
chise 100,000 negro voters in that State.
The Journal says:
"North Carolina has just entered
upon one of the most eventful cam
paigns in her history. It is a death
struggle between the Anglo-Saxon and
the African, and when the* smoke of
battle will have cleared the political
and social supremacy of the white man,
for the time, and for all time, will either
be absolute arid unconditional or else
negro domination will again immerse
the State in ignominy and disgrace.
The campaign is waged on a proposed
suffrage amendment to the constitu
tion submitted to the people by th<* last
Legislature. It was designed for the
single purpose of eliminating the negro
as a political factor, and it is a notable
fact that the educational qualification
enjoined on the negro is not expected
of the white man. It is not intended
that an Anglo-Saxon shall be disquali
fied.
"Every person of eligible age who
applies for registration, for instance,
must be able to read and write any
section or sections of the Federal con
stitution. Under this clause 100,000 in
competent negro voters in North Caro
lina will be forever barred from the
polls. But the ignorant white voters â
and there are perhaps thousands of
them â can enter through another gate.
"Section 5 provides that any lineal
descendant of any voter in this country
prior to 1867 shall be entitled to vote
whether he can read and write or not.
"It is more than a political fight; it
Is a fight in defense of home and de
cency. It is a constitutional decree
that the Anglo-Saxon shall govern in
this State. On this platform the Dem
ocracy stands. The Republicans have
challenged this amendment for party
protection. The issue has been joined.
For thirty years it has been dodged,
evaded, beclouded. It is to the point
now. It is the crucial test between
Southern Republicanism and Southern
Democracy/^
LOS ANGELES PREPARES
TO WELCOME BATTERY D
Members of the Company Will Re-
ceive Their Old Positions After
Muster Out.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2.-Th<? local war
board held a meeting this afternoon to
consider details pertaining to the recep
tion of Battery D, California Heavy Ar
tillery, when it arrives here after muster
out. It was determined among other
things to request the Board of Educa
tion to allow the. school children to be
marshaled at different points on the line j
of march of the pafade, which will be
a feature of the reception of Battery D,
the children to sing "America" as the
soldiers pass and wave small American
flaps with which they will be equipped.
The board also has under way a grand
benefit performance to lie given at the
Orphcum here on behalf oi a fund which |
le to be used to give material assistance
to such of the volunteers as may need
It. The various theatrical troupes* in the
city and local talent will contribute their
services to the benefit performance. The
entire proceeds of the entertainment will
go to the fund and a handsome sum is
expected. Leading local organizations
evince a willingness to pay big prices for
boxes and lng,-s and the present state of
public Interest in thp matter assures an
overflowing attendance at prices far in
advance of usual theater rates here.
Local business men with *Â»x-e inployes
in the battery declare they are willing to
reinstate the men in situations held at
the time of enlistment. This movement
was started well to-day when W. C. Pat
terson, leading merchant and banker, an
nounced that Corporal Doyle would be
re-i-mployed by him, anil Al Levy, a
prominent restaurant keeper, stated the
same regarding Sergeant Turner.
SAYS CAPE NOME
IS RICH IN GOLD
W. B. Derm the Latest to Boom the
Doubtful District in the
North,
BEATTLB, Sept. 2.â TV. B. Dran. a
well-known resident of this city, who
has just returned from Cape Nome,
claims that the district is very rich.
He said:
"Cape Nome bench has been pros
pected and demonstrated to contain
pay dirt for a distance of thirty-five
miles. There are 600 men beach min
ing, and I think it is a conservative
estimate to say that they are washing
out an average of $25 per day to the
man. The principal portion of the
work is being done between the mouth
of Snake and Penny rivers, a stretch
of beach ton miles in extent. The num
ber of beach diggers is increasing every
day.
"Jafel Lindeberg, John Brynston
and E. O. Lindblom had taken $40,000
in three clean-ups from No. 1 below
Anvil up to the time I left the district,
August 10. Thon the largest nugget
was worth $321 SO. This trio owns Dis
covers' claim and also three claims on
Snow Gulch. Captain Peach of San
Francisco has a lay on one of_ their
richest properties. He gets 25 per cent
of the cloan-up and the owners 75 per
cent. All told, Lindeberg, Brynson and
Lindblom own 2700 acres of the richest
placer ground in the Cape Nome dis
trict.
"Anvil, Glacier and Dexter creeks
were the most extensively worked creeks
up to the time I left. Buster and Ba
sin, tributaries of Nome, had been
worked more or less and some prospect
ing: clone on Rock and Mountain creeks.
"Anvil City has a population of
nearly 3000 people, and there are nearly
5000 all told in the district."
Big Raisin Deal.
FF/SNO, Sept. 2.â The bluest single
raisin d^al in the history of the Califor
nia Raisin Association was consummated
here to-day when li.i cars of three-crown
standard loose muscatels were sold for
over $100, tWO. The purchasers were hoe
Gray, president of the Fresno Home
Packing Company. and Thomas H.
Lynch, manager for Porter Bros. After
the deal had been made otht-r packers
brought up what goods they had in their
possession, with the result that 145 cars
Utere sold for $115,000. This practically
cleans up the crop of IS9S.

KLONDIKER ROBBED BY
THE "CHAMPAGNE TRICK"
A man namocl Barry, bartender at a
saloon on Kearny, near jackson street,
was arrested this morning 1 by Detective
McMahon and his name placed on the
detinue book at the Central Police sta
tion. Barry is believed by the police to be

hoe of Butte, Mont., recently returned
I from the Klondike.
Kehoe reported to th* police that on
i Thursday, after visiting- the saloon in
I question, he found all his money, amount-
I lngr to several hundred dollar?, missing.
The saloon attendants showed him a big
i array of champagne bottles, which they
j claimed he had houpht. and denied all
I knowledge of any robbery. The police are
| now trying to locate Kehoe, who has dis
appeared since reporting his loss.
Artificial Leg That Is Inflated.
An EngliÂ«h inventor has devised a
very ingenious artilioial leg and fool
intended for use in cases of amputation
below the knee join,t. It is mainly
composed of a hollow rubber chamber
â which is inflated in exactly the same
way as is a bicycle tire. The skeleton
of the foot, is of wood, and contains
within it a rubber-faced joint which
permits of movements like those that
take place at the ankle. A pair of rub
ber pneumatic pads surround the end
of the amputated limb, so that no un
due pressure is exerted on the tissue. â

Great Activity in Lumber.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says of Lum
ber: "Redwood Is running smoothly on a
Slightly elevated track, with every propect of
another nearby advance In prices. The time
Is near at hand for the final steps to be taken
ir. the consummation of the consolidation of
the redwood mills, and many Indications point
toward tho success of the- efforts. It is said on
the authority of a well-posted timber land
owner that several millions of dollars of East
ern car-ltal have recently been Invested in
Washington timber lands, and Eastern lumber
men are still seeking Investments. The foreign
demand for Washington mills Is Improving and
th* domestic call for lumber Is rood. At the
Et Paul and Tact-ma Lumber Company's wharf
alone there are now five veraela loading for the
coastwise traile, while M many more are under
charter and on the way to Taootna.
â These demands affect all the branches of the j
lumber trade, running into the wholesale and
retail yards, the planing mill concerns and thÂ« j
fash. door, blind and sash factories, as well
as increasing the profits of the shingle manu- |
facturer. the sawmills and the box factories.
Taken all la all. lumber is stronger than it has
been for several years, and there are indica
tions that th* present quotations will not be
allow?-: to stand long. It is altogether probable
before winter comes that the price list will
again be corrected and a very appreciable ad
vance in prices will be ordered. The domestic
and fcreicn -demand for this coast lumber la
so strong the mills will be compelled to ad
vance price*.
"In the hardwood market a tendency la be
ing fn-l t toward an Improver which is al
rr.o*t certain to come before many week* are

"Taking Washington and California and Ore
gon In fart, the whole West, there has never
bcÂ«n a peri In its history when there has
b?*n such a demand f'Jr lumber as there has
b*en daring the past three months. All the
vlunir.g and saw mills and sash and door fac
tories on the coast are away behind in their
orders and are working extra men. In Borne of
tin* largest mills new machinery of the most
ur-to-date pattern is being installed, and new

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. J.â The stock market was
Intensely dull throughout to-day's short ses
sion and net changes extends beyond fractions
only in rare instances. As the bears had sold
the market short In anticipation of the bank
statement, the evening up of their contracts,
when It appeared, closely conforming to esti
mates created a demand, relieving the market
of Its early depressions and brought prices in
most cases above yesterday's level. The fact;
that Monday Is a holiday had the effect of
keeping stock transactions at a minimum. The
report of a death from yellow fever In New
Orleans and the Texas quarantines caused
weakness In the railroads In the South, also
In Illinois Central. Brooklyn Transit and Ten
nessee Coal. Republic Steel stock* and A/nerl
enn "Tobacco led a rise before the bank state
ment came out. In contrast to the sudden
outbreak yesterday of activity in \anderbilts.
there was only a single sale in the first hour
of Northwestern and Omaha, the latter at . a
pain of a point. New York Central did not
appear on the tap" at all until the second
hour. Kansas and Texas seconds became ac
tive in the late dealings and advanced 1 per
The stock market haÂ« shown the effect* this
week of profit-taking by the organized pools,
which were active last week In advancing thÂ«
prices of certain railroad stocks. Those stocks {
have suffered most acutely, but the whole list
has shown an Increasing disposition to sag.
Early in the week the poolÂ« were sharply
manipulating the industrial specialties to bus- ,
tain prices and covering the realizing going I
on. The short interest in some* of the mi
i duntrlals was sensitive to the upward move- |
] ment and was inclined to cover, helping the
, strength. Ttve various professional maneuvers
Were the surface Indications of the culmination
Of the recent bull movement and the market j
; lapsed Into dullness and neglect after they
had been concluded. There was no hÂ»avy ;
liquidation In evidence outside the speculative j
profit-taking, and the market took, en the con- i
dition of sluggishness, which Indicates the con
tentment of the mass of holders of securities i
and the unwillingness of buyers to raise their
bids. This did not prevent the rise of railroad
stocks here and there from Individual causes. !
Earrings of railroads continue to show un- !
precedented results. But there Is no change
In the cautious and conservative policy here
tofore shown by railway managers. They have
continued to make extraordinary outlays for !
betterment, and In many instances are in- >
clined to pile up a surplus against future con- j
tingencies, or to put the surplus earnings Into
permanent Improvements designed to cheapen
the co?t of transportation. Present high prices
of railroad stocks have thus anticipated in
creased dividend disbursements, which in many
cases have not com*. The persistent Increase I
of railroad earnings makes the higher divi- .
dends Increasingly probable. But the actual
declaration has been in many cases more than
discounted. The stocks of iron and steel com- ]
panics on the exchange very obstinately re
fuse to advance owing to a feeling that the
present conditions In iron and steel are ab- ;
normal and necessarily transitory. Even the
buoyant tone of one stock in this group elicited j
little response elsewhere. The evidence of un- |
easiness, if not actually of distress, In for
eign financial centers on account of the heavy
bills they must pay to thi6 country are ac- |
cepted by the bear* as a symptom that easier
j money will be sought in future to satisfy their â¢
needs. So far as the Immediate outlook Is
concerned, money conditions are favorable to ;
the decline in prices of securities. The sur
plus reserves of New York banks are unprece

New York' Financial Condition.
1 NEW YORK. Sept. 2.â The Financier says: ,
The statement of the New York clearing- banks
for the week ending September 2 shows, as
1 had been anticipated, a loss in surplus reserve â 
! due to operations with the treasury and the .
I interior. The decrease In money held above
I legal requirements aggregated about 25 per
cent, and as there is no reason to exrect a I
different statement for a week or two to come j
the outlook favor* a lirmer tone in money. The
banks have apparently reached a position
where they enrmot expand their business, and |
If the demand for money from the West and
South attains considerable proportions con
tractions in outside standing commitments are
I Inevitable. The loans of the banks have been
! reduced steadily since the opening of July, the
; decrease up to the present having been forty
millions. Deposits show a heavier falling oft. j
I The result of thesa contractions, however, us
! reflected in excess cash. Is seen in an enlarge- '
! tnent of reserve of only five million dollars.
j These are the conditions under which the banks '
face a demand, the extent of which is in doubt,
for money needed to move the crow, Still,
i the outlook is not as dubious as might be in
ferred. The interior institutions are much ;
stronger than at this time last year and the
decline of foreign exchange rates forecasts
what may re expected If rates show a tendency
to rise beyond a reasonable figure. At this :
time last year the reserve* of the New York ;
1 banks were only five millions higher than nt
i present and fell to four and a quarter millions
lon September 4. but a month later, owing
! largely to gold imports and treasury operations, j
! the excess reserve had risen to about twenty
i millions. The movement of money to the West
j th's year will probably be much less than last,
i but in any event the method of recuperation :
thÂ»n employed is easier of accomplishment
now The principal feature In the current state
ment aside from the loss of J5.272.5cn la cash, !
is the decrease of $$.341,300 in deposits. Loans
in the face of considerable Stock hange ac
tivity have contracted $3,126,000. Circulation
for the week has increased J225.4C0.
Cash in the Treasury.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2.â To-<?s.y*9 statement ;
of the condition of the Treasury shows: Avail

which added materially to the bearishnesa of
the situation, though It did not have any
effect at first. A wild spurt took place in core
shortly after the opening. The advance in that
grain was so raaid that for the time being it
took wheat shorts oft* their feet and sent prices
up about Vie for September and about \c for
December. While the influence of the corn
firmness lasted there was considerable activity
In wheat, but when realizing set in in the
coarser grain and prices began to ease off,
wheat readily followed. The influence of the
heavy expected Northwestern receipts then be
gan to be felt. Heavy shorts who had held
aloof from the market during the early spurt
came into tie market then and gradually 1
pressed prices downward. Tito selling of De- j
cember was much more affected than that of '
September and that option suffered more In
consequence. During the last hour of the short
Saturday session early buyers turned sellers,
but the demand wa,s too light to absorb the
offerings and the market closed weak and at
the bottom. December opened unchanged at

The market for corn was active and broad.
Continued dry and hot weather was reported
from the West. and fear of damage was

tory as to quality. Foreign cables were lower,
and there was some frost In the Northwest.
Chicago traders were mostly bullish, but looked
for a. further brsak before any recovery. The
export demand was light. The close wai rather
firmer. , Â _

Receipts of Hay were very large again, being
1252 tons, and the market continued very weak
for the medium grades, though there was no
weakness in choice. The latter description Is
! expected to keep up the balance of the season,
I whatever the medium and lower grades do.
The circular of George Morrow &. Co. says:
"Receipts for the week, 4355 tons. A very dull
I market with continued heavy receipts expresses
i the situation. There has been no change in
j prices and there Is no likelihood of any, so
i long as receipts continue in excess of all de- ;
I martds. Evidently some farmers are at the ]
\ same opinion as ourselves with reference to ;
' choice wheat hay, as receipts of game for the â 
i past few days have been most noticeable by 'â 
: their absence. To-day there is a good inquiry â 
I for choice wheat hay and if shipments only j
i continue Hrht for a while longer the price will
' advance some.
'Farmers holding choice red or black oat :
hay would do well to ship some in now, as the ;
â upply is small and the demand is good and
healthy."

HOSPITAL SHIP
RELIEF IS NOT
A SAFE VESSEL
A Passenger Permit
Refused Her.
TWELVE TRANSPORTS IN PORT
THE WAKREN AND LEELANAW
SAIL FOR MANILA.
AH the Others Will Get Away During
tli* Month, Carrying About
Fifteen Thousand
Soldiers.
The hospital ship Relief was condemned
yesterday by local Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers liolles mid Bulger bo far as the
carrying of passengers is concerned. The
Inspectors found that she was top-heavy
and not safe to be used as a passenger
vessel, and they have recommended that
she be used by the Government as a.
freight vessel to ply in the Philippine Isl
ands. The Relief was to have carried
hospital nurses and doctors and was to
have sailed on the 16th Insf. She will now
probably have her hurricane deck re
moved and will then pass muster.
Two ii the transports got away for Ma
nila yesterday. The JL>ee;aJia.w bailed dur
ing the morning with a load of horses and
mules and the "Warren went out in the
afternoon, with nearly 1000 recruits. There
were not many people on the docks to
Bee either vessel away, but the soldiers on
the Warren made some tun before the
transport departed. A number of them
tried bo pass the guard, and when they
failed endeavored to walk the hawser
from the ship to the shore. Every one of
them fell Into the bay, and the boatmen
were kept busy fishing them out of the
water. Sergeant Matthews was the last
man to ina-ke the ulteiiiiA, and he came
very near drowning, lie struck his head
egainat the anchor, and had not Henry
Peterson dived 111 after him he would
never have- come out 01 the water alive.
There were twelve transports in the bay
yesterday, and the Tacoma, due here from
Seattle, would have made the unlucky
thirteen had she arrived in time. The
departure of the L**elanaw and Warren
eaves the situation, however, and every
man on the fleet is glad in consequence.
Every sailor on the- Iront vows that had
the thirteen transports been in port to
gether "one of them would never have
reached Manila."
The transport Grant comes off the Hun
ters Point drydock to-day. She will sail
for Manila about September 20. The Han
cock's repairs will not be completed for
three weeks, and It will be the first week
In October before she sails. The Sikh,
Belgian King and George W. Elder are
the only vessels of the fleet that have not
taken on their white dress. The Elder
arrived yesterday and went at once on
the drydock. After she comes off coal
will be put aboard and then she and the
other two steamers will be painted white.
She will start for Manila the last week in
the month.
The Centennial and the Columbia will
be ready to sail this week, and both will
probably depart on Friday. The Colum
bia will carry troops and' the Centennial
horses. The work of getting the Aztec
and Sherman ready is being rushed, and
they will probably sail on the 12th inst.
The Aztec will carry over 4000 tons of
supplies and a number of horses, while
the Sherman will convey about 1500 sol
diers. The Tacoma, which is expected
every minute from the Sound, will be pre
pared as quickly as possible and the en
tire fleet will be nt pea before October la
very old. With those on the way they
should give General Otis about 25.000 ad
ditional trooDS by the middle of Novem
ber. Apart from these there is a fleet on
the way here from Manila, all of which
â¢will be sent back as ouickly as they can
be got- ready. The Sheridan is now out
twenty-three days and the Zealandia and
"Valencia eleven days, while the Pennsyl
vania, City of Para. Tartar. Newport.
Ohio and Indiana are expected to sail any
day. _^_^__^^____

UNDERGROUND DUCTS RULE
MILES OF CONDUITS WILL SOON
BE LAID.
TTie Spreckels Company Piles Its
Specifications With the Super
visors â Thousands of Dol
lars Will Be Expended.
There are more things than unpaid
; city gas bills coming before the Board
of Supervisors to make Mr. Crockett of ;
the gas combine wince and look to the j
welfare of his company's slocks. Yester
i day Clerk Russell was requested to take
1 and file for the Independent Electric ]
, Light and Power Company the speciiieu- |
tions for the line of conduits upon which !
it proposes to soon begin work. The j
spi-cifiea tions were accompanied by an I
undertaking, upon which Claus Spreckeis
and A. B. Spreckels appeared as sureties,
to lay the conduits within the strictest
provision of the law and subject to the
supervision and decision of the Superin
tendent of Streets. A blue print map was
i also enclosed outlining the work first to
; be begun, that of station A, which begins j
at the sugar refinery at Georgia and
Humboldt streets and runs west on Hum
i boldt to Illinois, north on Illinois to
Twenty-second, west on Twenty-second I
to Kentucky, north on Kentucky to Mari
: posa and thence west to Mississippi.
j The specifications provide for terra cotta
ducts to be set In an encasement of con
crete. The ducts are to be placed at a
depth of from two and one-half to three
feet under the grade of the street, ac
! cording to the obstacles that may be met 1
with. The trenches to be deg along the j
public highways will be approximately
eighteen inches wide. Brick manholes
with castlron heads will be set in at in- 1
tervals-and branch pipes will be laid from |
: the main conduits to the curb In order
that consumers' lines may be connected.
Every important residence and business |
street in the city is to be grilled with
wire, but under the surface where, al
though it will be more expensive, will be
less unsightly. The specifications provide j
j for conduits along the following Btreets: ,
1 From Georgia and Humboldt streets, on
Humboldt to Illinois, on Illinois to Twenty
. second, on Twenty-second to Kentucky, on

PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM.
A Branch Likely to Be Established in
This City.
The Merchants' Association haa now
taken up the matter of establishing a
branch of the Philadelphia Museum in
this city. Six weeks ago The Call pub
lished an outline of the plan suggested,
stating at the time that as soon as the
consideration of the tax levy by that or
ganization was finished it would start
the movement under consideration. A
ehort time before one or two of the mem
bers of the association were In Philadel
phia, and to them Manager Wilson pro
posed that if the Merchants and com
mercial people of this city would take
hold of the project in earnest he would
furnish a large quantity of the surplus
exhibits to the Western branch.
The establishing of a branch in San
Francisco is regarded by the business men
of the community as a matter of no small
importance. It means the creation of a
numberli ss variety of samples of prod
ucts from every country In the world,

with prices, conditions of packing, de
mand, supply, etc.. which would furnish
Invaluable information for local business
men and exporters. And further, such
an establishment here would bring to this
city thousands of purchasers from all
parts of the Western Hemisphere. At the
meeting of the directors or the associa
tion Thursday many of the features of
the subject were discussed. At the con
clusion Secretary Freud said:
"Having had considerable correspond
ence with the Philadelphia Commercial
Museum the board decided to refer the
matter of the establishment of a branch
museum in this city to a special commit
tee on trade and finance. This committee
will secure further information and re
port to the board of directors its conclu
sions. It was decided to ask members of
the association intending to visit the
Eastern States to visit personally the
Philadelphia Museum, so as to become
thoroughly acquainted with its general
workings and objects. It is the general
opinion of the directors that the estab
lishment in this city of a branch of the
Philadelphia Museum would be productive
of great benefit to the commercial In
terests of San Francisco."
