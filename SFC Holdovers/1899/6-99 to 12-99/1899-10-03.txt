victor on every point "f sailing and
under almost all conditions is no small
triumph.
Mr. Iselln is to sail the Columbia,
aided by Captain "Charlie" Barr. Cap
tains Hogarth and Wringe. two of tho
most expert of the British yacht cap
tains, are to sail the Shamrock. As an
r they will have with them Cap

Important and interesting is the fol
lowing agreement entered into by the
two contestants. It is significant, too,
h iwing the spirit which animates
h.Â«th the English knight and the Amer
ican yachtsman. The agreement is as
follows:
How the Yacht Race Will Be Sailed.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1899.
Inasmuch as wp arp of the opinion that
the America's cup races arp no less a t p st
of Btrengtb of construction of competing
vessels than of their sailing finalities, and
it is deemed advisable to avoid the em
barrassment in which a vessel finds itself
when called upon to decide whether to
withdraw from a race upon the occur
rence of an accident disabling her com
petitor, it is agreed that in the races be
â¡ the Shamrock and the Columbia
each yacht shall stand by the eonse
ea of ;iny accident happening to her,
hat the uninjured vessel shall sail
out the race.
SIR THOMAS LTPTON,
C. OLIVER IBELIN.
It is conceded that weather condi
tions will be an important factor in the
race, as all who have followed the per
formance of the two yachts believe that
the Shamrock is much more dangerous
in ;i good stiff wind than she is in a
light one. If weather experts prove
right the Shamrock will have a wind of
li^r own choosing to-morrow. "Wind
fresh to brisk' is the Washington fore
cast, and therein seems another case pf
"Upton luck."
Fifteen miles to windward and re
turn, or a fifteen-mile run out and a
beat back, according to the direction
of the wind, will comprise to-morrows
race. If the wind be off shore the
yachts will go before "end on" to tho
Duter mark and then beat back to the
finish. If the wind be from the oppo
site direction the racers will beat out
;ind run back.
The start will be made from Sandy
Hook lightship at as near 11 a. m. as
practicable, the preparatory signal
being given fifteen minutes in advance.
But always with the understanding
that should the wind prevent the lay
ing- of the course from the lightship the
starting line will be shifted to the
nearest available point, and that in this
case the preparatory signal will be
given about half an hour before the
time set for starting from the light
ship.
The courses will be as follows:
No. 1. â From the starting line to and
around a mark fifteen miles to wind
ward or leeward, and return, leaving
the mark on the starboard hand.
No. 2. â From the starting line ten
miles to and around a mark, ten miles
to and around a second mark, and ten
miles to finish line, leaving the marks
f-n the outside of the triangle, to port
.r starboard, according as the vessels
are sent around.
The starting and finish lines will be
between a point on the committee boat
indicated by a white flag and the main
mast of the lightship, or other stake
boat if the start is shifted from the
lightship. These lines will be at right
angles with the outward and home
courses respectively.
The goal, or turning point (outer
mark), which each yacht will strive to
reach and round before the other, is

DEWEY WELCOMED AT WASHINGTON BY
THE NATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE,
Admiral and President Review One of the Most Dazzling Night Parades
Ever Held at the Capital.
Scene in the East Room of the White House, Where Admiral
Dewey Was Presented to the President by Secretary Long.
WASHINGTON', Oct. 2. -The
home-coming of Admiral
George Dewey â for hence
forth the national capital is
to be his horne â was made
the occasion for the greatest tribute
ever paid by Washington to any indi
vidual. After the preliminary welcome
in New York, itself unsurpassed in its
kind, it remained for the highest and
greatest in the official world to hold
out the hand of greeting to the famous
admiral and to join with the people
who are to be his fellow citizens in bid
ding him welcome. The citizens had
made every preparation to make the
occasion worthy of their hero. The dec
orations were elaborate. Pennsylvania
avenue was <me mass of colored bunt
ing along the entire line of march, from
the station to the White House, and,
not content with this, few private
citizens failed to make some dis
play of color on their residences.
T'nique designs dotted the horizon;
great searchlights threw beams of
bright light across the blue sky on a
clear October evening and "the stately
Capitol stood revealed in its queenly
beauty in the powerful rays of many
concentrated lights.
The same device was used effectively
in the case of other public buildings
i within the range of vision of Admiral
Dewey and the President, as they re
viewed the throng of people from the
prow of the white Olympia projecting
from the center of the stand erected
Just south of the Treasury building at
the head of Pennsylvania avenue. On
the facade of the newly completed Gov-
I ernmont Posurffiee building flamed
forth two inscriptions set in electric
points, the one reciting the famous
; message of the President directing
Tir-.sey, then thousands of miles away
in the Far East, to go forth to destroy
the Spanish Meet, and the other setting
out the famous admiral's direction to
the lamented Gridley, "You may fire
when you are ready, Gridlc*y." which
marked an epoch in the history of the
T'nit^d States. Twelve thousand mem
bers of civic organizations paraded be
fore him. besides tens of thousands of
non-organized citizens, and in a roar at
cannon rockets and the blaze of red fire
and the thunderous cheering of the
populace and the warm greeting of the
head of the nation Dewey came to the
i national capital and to a welcome such
as has not been known here hitherto.
His journey from New York had been
one continuous ovation, limited in its
intensity only by. the density of popu
| lation. The decorated special train
j which left the Pennsylvania Railroad
ferry slip in Jersey City at 1:50 o'cloch
in the afternoon was fully in keeping
with its distinguished passenger. It
was made up of fi% - e cars, the Penn
sylvania's prize special, the Atalanta,
1 a dining-car, a combination smoker
| and three parlor cars for the accom-
I mod&tion of the Washington reception
j committee. The special was given a
' clear track and the run to Washington
! was made without a stop except at
i Grays Ferry, on the outskirts of Phil
! adelphia, where engines were changed
! and a new train crew came aboard.
| Almost immediately after going aboard
' the train the admiral retired to his
private car for luncheon, which was
; served for sixâ Admiral Dewey, his son
i George, his brother and wife, Captain
i Lamberton and Lieutenant Brumby.
Thereafter the admiral lay down and
' tried to get a little sleep, but this was
impossible owing to the continuous
ovation along the line.
It was said by the railroad officials
and trainmen that the ovation during
; the run from New York to Washington
1 was the most remarkable demonatra
j tion that has ever taken place along
j the line. Every town turned out its
full population and every house and
! crossroads settlement was turned in-
I side out to see the flying special pass.
! It had been the intention of the well
i meaning committee to notify all towns
along the route at what hour the spe
cial might be expected, but the train
1 dispatcher at Jersey City headed them
j off and offered a hasty protest, saying
i that it was next to impossible to get
> the special out of town and that notice
in advance would probably block the
tracks. Apparently, however, the rail
road telegraph operators had passed
the tip along and the crowds were on
hand as though they had been sent for.
A bare stop was made at Princeton,
i where young Dewey had been a stu
-1 dent, and the admiral went to the plat-
I form for a minute, merely saying to
; the boys that he was pleased with the
I reception they had given him. It was
i such a reception as an Emperor might
| have envied, every student of the col
> i laze town beine in evidence as well as
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2.â lt is
said to-night that Admiral
Dewey is engaged to marry the
widow of the late General Wil
liam B. Hazen, who is a daugh
ter of Mrs. Washington McLean,
at whose home the admiral is be
ing entertained. The rumor is
widely current, and in fact has
been in the air ever since the an
nouncement was made that Ad
miral Dewey would be the guest
of the McLean household during
the reception festivities, but has
not been confirmed. Mrs. Hazen
is a sister of John R. McLean.

ernor of Ohio, and remarkable

the whole population of the place, while
college yells resounded above the rum
ble of the departing train.
Admiral Dewey was particularly
touched all along the line by the num
ber of children who turned out to see
him. They formed a very large part
of the crowd in every town, and wher
ever there was a schoolhouse the chil
dren had evidently been given a spe
cial recess to come out and cheer the
train. There was another large crowd
of children at Baltimore, and Admiral
Dewey. who had come to the rear
platform for the sixth or seventh time
on the trip, said to the trainmaster,
who was standing by him, that he felt
more touched and complimented by the
attention of the children than by al
most any other thing that had hap
pened since his return to America.
. All along the line every train, freight
and passenger, that passed the special
saluted it with a long drawn blast of
the whistle, and in all the large towns
where the flyer slowed down within the
city limits there was a continual roar
of steam from factories, machine shops
and the shifting engines and trains on
the sidings. Every engineer seemed to
have been bottling up steam for an
hour in advance and hung out of h ; s
cab window with his hand on the
whistle cord while the fireman, hang
ing to the hand rails and running
board, swung the bell as though ring
ing for a crossing. Chester and Wil
mington seemed to have come down to
the depots en masse, and the train ran
slowly between wide lanes of people
from one end of the town to the other,
while every lamppost, awning pole and
shade tree bore a crop of young Ameri
cans, and the roofs of freight cars on
the siding were converted into grand
stands for the brief instant that the
train swept by. The admiral responded
good naturedly to all these calls on his
stock of strength that he had been re
serving for the trying ordeal in Wash
ington, and came time and again to
the platform to bow as the train went
by.
The train as it reached the line of the
District of Columbia stopped for a few
minutes at the little station of Dean
wood, while the reception committee
went through the formality of present

ing the nation's guest the freedom of
the District. The ceremony was per
formed by District < 'ommissioner
Wieht in the presence of the admiral's
fleet captains, the military and naval
members of the party and as many of
the reception committee as could be
crowded into the admiral's car.
John Addison Porter, secretary to the
President, first extended President Mc-
Kinley's greetings, to which the admi
ral returned his thanks very briefly.
â¢ '"mmissioner Wight then said: "Ad
miral Dewey, you are now in the Dis
trict of Columbia, and, representing: the
commissioners of the District, I have
the honor of tendering you the freedom,
of the- national capital, and in behalf
of the people of the District, from the
most exalted to the most humble citi
zen. I give you a sincere and cordial
welcome home. . We feel gratified that
Washington is to be your future home.
It is the best place in the world in
which to have a home. and it is fitting
that you, who have done so much for
the nation and have done such an im
portant part for the nation, should
make your future home in the nation's
capital. The people of Washington will
esteem it not only a pleasure but an
honor to do all in their power to make
your stay with us as pleasant as your
services have been successful at Ma
nila."
Admiral Dewey's reply was as brief
and characteristic as all of his other
speeches have been.
"I want to thank you very much, my
friends," he said, "for this testimonial
of your regard. It is true that as long
as I live â and I hope to live a long
time (cheers) â I intend to live in Wash
ington. I thank you again for this ex
pression."
Then dropping the tone of formality
I in which this had been uttered, he cx
i tended his hands and said heartily:
I "Now I want to see my friends. Char
' lie, old boy, how are you?" and he
; grasped C. C. Glover by the hand and
I went through the party, shaking the
i hands of all who were within reach.
In a few minutes the train was in the
i brilliantly lighted depot. The middle
i aisle of the station had been carpeted
i clear to the carriage entrance. The
I committeemen and the "fighting line,"
las the brilliantly uniformed officers
i were termed, all alighted, while A. L.
Moses, the chairman of the reception
committee, Theodore Noyes of the
i Evening Star, Commissioner Ross and
! Archibald Greenlees went into the ad
j miral's car and after a few words of
' formal greeting brought him out. Tak-
I ing the arm of Mr. Moses, he headed
! the procession down the station, while
I the officers and committeemen fell in
jat the rear. It was a procession as
I brilliant as a diplomatic reception. The

From the moment a bulletin is writ

party to leave the station was the
citizens and army and
navy officials, who had gone to New
York to meet the famous admiral and
rt him to Washington. They were
quickly followed by the admiral him
and when he appeared to take Ins

almost wild with excitement. The
Marine Band gave the four flourishes
which naval etiquette requires, and
then played "Under the Double Eagle"
by Wagner, which is said to be a spe
cial favprlte with the admiral, and
which, at his request, the Olympiads
band played as the fleet sailed out of

White House, down the gravel walks
and i vi to the street in the rear of the
treasury. The crowd seemed to know
that the hero was approaching, for a
great wave of cheering went up and
Pennsylvania avenue was bathed in
light from end to end.
The stand had been erected at the
head of Pennsylvania avenue, just
south of the Treasury Department
building, anil as Dewey moved through!
: the stand to the prow built out from its
front leaning on the arm of President
McKinley the crowd started a mighty
cheer, which passed down the avenue
and was taken up for blocks. The ad
! miral frequently bowed his acknowl
edgments. The President and Ad
! miral Dewey were joined at the front
: of the stand by Secretaries Hay. Root,
! Hitchcock and Wilson and Postmaster
General Smith, officers of the Olympia
and 'other naval officials. As the cheer- j
ing at length died away the admiral I
turned to President McKinley and the
two, seating, turned to conversation
while awaiting the procession.
The head of the civic parade which
had been arranged In honor of the ad
miral began to pass in review before
him shortly after 8 o'clock. There were
' many novel and interesting features re
lieving the sameness of the ordinary
I civic parade. The spectacle, as the
I marchers came up the length of the
avenue In the glare of the red lights,
â¢ under sweeping arches of stars from
; thousands of roman candles, was beau
tiful and impressive. The beginning of
I the march was heralded by the burst
! ing of thousands of giant crackers,
! while bombs along the line sent show-
I ers of fire into the air.
The column was headed by General
i George Harris, chief marshal, leading
| a numerous body of bicyclists. The
j wheels were interwoven with garlands
i and wreaths of flowers and greens and
jTolored bunting, and every wheelman
carried Chinese lanterns. Many were
in costume. Close behind the splendid j
Marine Band came the veteran organi
\ zations, and Dewey, himself a veteran
, and a Grand Army of the Republic
, man, looked with pride, mingled with
i sorrow, upon the gray heads who
; marched past with as bold a step as
advancing years permitted. Rounds of
' applause went out to the veterans of
| the Spanish war, who mustered in
, creditable numbers for the parade.
A formidable detachment in the line
l was that of the International Machin
ists, following a great 5-inch rifle can
. non from the Washington navy yard,
1 bearing the inscription: "We make the
guns for Dewey."
The Catholic societies of the District
j made a special effort to do honor to j
the admiral and with excellent results,
I for their contingent was one of the j
most numerous and effective in the j
column. They bore great illuminated j
crosses. Many of the orders were in !
uniform, and all of the marchers car
i ried flaming red torches.
The letter carriers had all of the
j local postal cars in line, ablaze with
I electric light, spelling words of welcome
to Dewey. One of their features was a
gigantic illuminated envelope addressed
to Admiral George # Dewey. Manila, and
J marked "Returned" to Washington."
THE SAN FE AN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1809.
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â Naval
Constructor Francis T. Bowles,
who docked the Columbia and
Shamrock in the navy-yard, said
to-day when asked his opinion
of the relative merits of the two
boats:
"It is hard to form an opinion
â which is of any value on a mere
inspection of boats as they lie
in the drydock, so much depends
on the distribution of the weight
and sail. From all that I could
see, however, the advantage ap
pears to me to be decidedly
with the Columbia."
others.
The United States Government fully
appreciates the importance of the re
searches and expeditions made by
ir Marconi into the mysterious
world of electricity. After the yacht !
l-aces th.- inventor of wireless teleg- j
raphy is to conduct a series of demon- !
strations for the benefit of the experts

The German societies had a most
creditable representation, and alto
gether the civic parade was a worthy
one As the rear of the column passed
the public fell in behind ? nd
before the reviewing stand, for an hour
to get a glimpse of their hero. Dewey
The crowd was so eager to see Dewey
that they spoiled the effectiveness of
this part of the arrangements b>
breaking through the ropes and surging
about the grand stand, where they
gave vent to wild cheering and a noisy
demonstration that completely upset
this part of the review. Admiral
Dewey gave frequent acknowledgment
to the cheers for him and, seeing that
the review had lost its distinctive char
acter as a procession, quitted his place
early and with the President, followed
by the members of the Cabinet, left the
stand the admiral proceeding to the
home 'of his hostess, Mrs. McLean, and
some of the others -accompanying the
President to the White House.
The procession was in line for a hair
hour later and there were frequent sa
lutes in ignorance of the admiral ab-
It was 9:10 o'clock when the fatigued
recipient of the day's demonstration
reached the residence of Mrs. Washing
ton McLean, mother of the Democratic
candidate for Governor of Ohio, on X
street, facing Farragut square. He -was
accompanied by Chairman Moses, his
two aids. Lieutenants Brumby and
Caldwell, and his son. George C. Dewey,
arriving at the same time. The admiral
was met at the head of the staircase
by Mrs. McLean and her daughters,
Mrs. Hazen and Mrs. Ludlow, and her
grandson. Captain Frederick Beger.
Mrs. McLean welcomed the admiral
and turned over the house to him for
his use during his stay in Washington.
Mrs. McLean and the members of her
family then left, going to her country
residence, Beaver, in the suburbs of
Washington. The admiral had arrived
sooner than was expected and before
a crowd had collected. Presently the
people surged on all sides and for some
time would not believe the officer, who
said the admiral was inside. A band
came up and serenaded the admiral,
the crowd cheered and cheered and fin
ally Dewey appeared at the window
and bowed his ackowledgments. Cries
of "Speech, speech" were heard on
every side, but met with no response.
Luncheon was served by 9:30 o'clock
and then the admiral retired. Crowds
lingered about the house for some time.
NOW COMES THE GREAT
INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE
FOR THE AMERICA'S CUP
Continued from First Pagp.
to be a white float, carrying a red ball
with horizontal white stripes. The po
sition of the mark will be indicated by
a two-masted tug lying about one hun
dred yards beyond. The tutr will carry
a red ball at each masthead and will
swing a red ball from the triatic stay.
I Should a mark be wrecked its place
will be taken by its marking tug,
which will display a red flag with a
diagonal white stripe in addition to
other indication?, and the turning tug
directions for the mark will govern.
These are the starting signals:
Preparatoryâ A gun will be fired, the
"Blue Peter" set and a red ball hoisted.
Startâ Fifteen minutes later a gun will
te fired and the ball will drop. Handicap
time, two minutes later, a gun will be
fired and the "Blue Peter" hauled down.
Should a signal gun miss fire, a pro
longed blast of a whistlo will be Rivrn.
At the finish a short blast will be given
as each vessel crosses the line.
Preliminaryâ Should the start be mate
rially postponed (fifteen minutes or over),
a preliminary signal will be made by the
discharge of a gun and the display of a
yacht ensign fifteen minutes prior to the
preparatory signal. At night after dark
at the marking tugs and at the finish line
the committee bo;it (and stake boat, if
the start has been shifted from the light
ship) will show four red lights horizontal
ly, and the guide vessel will show four
white lights in a similar manner, and the
marks will hang two white lights verti
cally.
Fogâ At three-minute Intervals the
marking tugs will give five short w"histle
blasts, with two-second Intervals between
the second and third and the fourth and
tlfth, and if the start has been shifted
from the lightship, at the finish line the
committee boat will strike five strokes
upon the bell.
The races shall be sailed on Tues
days, Thursdays and Saturdays until
completed, commencing on Tuesday,
October 3. The racing rules, time al
lowances and system of measurement
of the New York Yacht Club shall
govern. Best three out of five races,
each thirty nautical miles in length,
over the ocean courses outside of the
headlands and with a time limit of five
and a half hours, the first, third and
fifth races being fifteen mlies to win
ward or leeward and return, and the
second and fourth being around an
equilateral triangle, ten miles to a leg.
In every case the outward course shall
be laid to windward if possible and
from Sandy Hook lightship.
If a race has not been started by
1:30 p. DO. the committee may postpone
it for the day and no race shall be
started after 8 p. m. The committee
may postpone the start In case of ac
cident or if the course cannot be laid
from the lightship, as already stated.

, GOVERNORS IST. AND, N. V.. Oct. 2.â
i Signor Marconi: Captain Squier wishes
, to have me convey to you his compliments
.md congratulations on yesterday's work.
WIL.DMAN, Signal Officer.
W. J. Clarke, general manager of the
i United States Electrical Supply Com
] pany of this city, who will be in charge
] on the Grande Duchesse, began experi
-1 menting in wireless telegraphy in the
year 1881, when he was a resident of
; Trenton, Canada. Mr. Clarke was the
â  first in this country to take up and
; follow the work of Mr. Marconi, and al
; though many others have followed in
I the same line, Mr. Clarke has been by
â¢ far the most successful.
The transmitter which will be used
upon the Grande Duchesse will consist
]of a specially designed transformer
which converts a perfectly harmless
current of a small storage battery into
, a current of hundreds of thousands of
; volts. One terminal of the transformer
; will be connected to a perpendicular
j wire hung from the foremast of the
1 ship and the other terminal will be im
mersed in water. Immediately at the
I transformer, however, the two ter
i minals will be provided with brass
balls on oscillators placed about half
;an inch apart. The transmitter key is
: somewhat similar to the ordinary tele
graph key, and is arranged so that
: when it is pressed a current from the
battery is turned into the transformer
if in their opinion the space around the
starting line is not sufficiently dear in
case of fog and if both vessels assent
to a postponement, !n which case the
time of starting will be fixed by the
committee.
The committee boat will display the
I committee flag and at the finish of
each race she will display a red ball.
The courses will be laid by Lieutenant
Commander H. H. Hosley, United
I States navy (New York Yacht Club).
The guide vessel will be under com
| ma ml of Lieutenant R. T. Mullivan,
United States navy (New York Yacht
Club). On starting she will display
two speed cones, and when half way
down the course will masthead a third.
When stationary the cones will be re
versed. Should it be necessary to move
the starting line from the lightship an
emergency tug will act as stakeboat at
the start and finish, and a like com
mittee boat will display a red b&ll. The
seagoing tug Luckenbach will be the
committee boat and will take up a po
sition near the lightship, the line be
tween the two being the line which the
yachts will cross at the start and at
the finish.
SHAMROCK SECURES
A TIME ALLOWANCE
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.-One of thÂ«
greatest surprises for yachtsmen
since the arrival of the Shamrock In
these waters was the announcement
officially made at the New York Yacht
Club to-night that the Columbia would
have to allow the Shamrock six and
thirty-one hundredths seconds on a
thirty-mile course.
It was generally supposed by yachts
men who have sees both yachts sail
and in the drydock that the Shamrock
by reason of , 1( -r greater sail spread
and apparently larger hull, would have
to give the Columbia something like a
minute time allowance over the thirty
mile courses which they are to sail. It
appears, however, that Designer Fife,
while giving the Shamrock a larger sail ;
plan than the Columbia has, at the
same time so constructed her hull so as
to give her greater free board, less
displacement and consequently a
shorter waterline by almost two feet.
At , o'clock to-night two of the regu
lation measurer's certificate ns, one
showing the Columbia's measurements
the other the Shamrock's, were posted
on the bulletin board of the New Â¥ork
Y;i< hi club's house. They were Bigned
by the dub's official measurer, John
Hyslop, and read as follows:
Dimensionsâ Length of water line Co
lumbia 98.66, Shamrock 57.69.
From after end of mall boon to forward
point of measurement, Columbia * 181.62
feet, Shamrock I&U3.
From foresail i f foremast to forward
point of measu -ement, Columbia 73 35,
bhumroek 79.46.
Extreme of spinnaker boom, Columbia
(3.X5, bhamrook 79,-iii.
Main gaff, Columbia 64.95, Shamrock '
G< .64.
Topmastâ Columbia's length 64.50 minus 1
one-fifth, equals 61.60; Shamrock's top
mast s,viM>, minus one-fifth, equals 4-;.4...
Height of upper side of main boom to
topsail halyard block. Columbia 134 7;,
Shamrock 126.28.
Square feet of sail area ;us per rule, Co
lumbia 114.61, Shamrock M.h>.
Hailing length as pei run . ( lolumbia
102.135. Shamrock 101.92.
Tlu- Shamrock's topmast measures 58.6,
one-iifth uft, leaving 46.45 feet.
By these figures it will be seen that
all the Shamrock's spars, except the
topmast, are longer than those of the
Columbia. For instance, the Columbia's
main boom measures 108.27; the Sham
rock's 109.67, making the latter spar
1.40 longer than the Columbia's. Meas
urements of the gaff show 2.69 in favor
of the Shamrock. The Shamrock's spin
naker boom is 6.11 longer than the Co
lumbia's, but her topmast is 6.44 shorter
than that of the American boat.
Judging from the stability of the
Shamrock during her recent trial spins
off gandy Hook Designer Fife has been
able to give his boat a greater amount
of lead ballast than at first supposed by
the yachting sharps who have predicted
that the Shamrock would not be able
to carry her sail.
Thof-e yachtsmen at the club to-night
who heard of the measurements of the
two yachts agree that the Shamrock
will really prove a worthy antagonist
of the tenth defender of the America's
cup.
It was half-past 1 o'clock to-day be
fore the Shamrock was warped into
the drydock where the Columbia had
been measured and the coissc.-n closed,
making the water smooth for the meas
urements. Just before going on board
his yacht, Sir Thomas Lipton said:
"I am extremely sorry that Mr. Fife
is not present. It is a very unfortunate
thing at this time. He Is unable to
leave his hotel, but I hope he can be
with us to-morrow during the race. \W
have done the best we could without
him to-day."
Sir Thomas, Vice Commander Sher
man Crawford and H. McGill Downey
of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club, with
Henry F. Lippltt of the New York
Yacht Club, who will represent the lat
ter club on the Shamrock during the
race, then went on board with Meas
urer Hyslop, his assistant and Captain
Nathaniel Herreshoff, the designer of
the Columbia.
After the measurer's steel chain had
be?n stretched from the topmast down
the mast to the top of the main boom
and from the bowsprit end to the main
boom end all those who will sail in the
Shamrock during the race, some thirty
In all, including Sir Thomas Lipton, sat
on deck on each side amidshipe while
Measurer Hyslop, Captain Hereshoff
and Harry Lippett proceeded to meas
ure the yacht's waterline. This work
occupied two hours and a half. The
and a high tension current is generated
immediately and across between the
two balls, or in other words, the per
pendicular wire is rapidly charged and
discharged and electric waves gener
ated by this peculiar action pat-s out
into space until they reach the receiv
ing apparatus on the cable boat, which
immediately responds to every impulse
of the transmitter.
While the whole arrangement of the
apparatus appears simple in the ex
treme there are many little details
which experts in wireless telegraphy
are alone capable of managing, and al
though when everything is perfectly
adjusted it is an easy matter to trans
mit at the rate of twenty words a min
ute, if anything should go wrong with
the installation it requires the trained
eye of an expert to locate and remove
the difficulty. Mr. Clarke says that
wireless telegraphy is rapidly ap
proaching such perfection of detail that
it will be but a very short time until
it is capable of bMng operated easily
by ordinary Morse operators, and fur
ther than this, predicts that it will be
but a year or so until operators will
be able to transmit by wireless teleg
raphy fully as rapidly, if not more so,
than by the present system.
The Ponce, with a party of excursion
ists, will leave her dock at the foot of
Twenty-fourth street promptly at 9:30
o'clock to-morrow morning and will
run directly to the starting point of the
day's race. Passengers will be landed
in all probability at an hour early
enough to permit them to return to
their homes In. time for dinner.
I yacht's waterline was then marked on
I each quarter with a red letter "V," and
at the bow by a white stripe across her
i benm.
At 4 o'clock Sir Thomas Upton and
I his party left the yacht, the caisson
was swung open, lines cast off. and the
Shamrock, with housed topmast, was
towed away from the navy-yard by a
tug. She arrived and mad*" fast to her
moorings in Sandy Hook Bay at 6:10
p. m., receiving salutes as she passed
down the East River and the upper
bay from almost every passing
steamer. Just before leaving the
navy-yard for his steam yacht Erin
Sir Thomas Lipton called his captains
and gave them final instructions about
the preparations for to-morrow's event,
which means so much to him and them.
He had evidently gathered from what
he had seen and heard while the yacht
was being measured that she certainly
would not have to give the Columbia
any time allowance, and he was cor
respondingly cheerful when he came to
take leave of his two skippers.
The weather indications, according to
the special forecast sent out from
Washington, are that the wind will he
fresh from the northeast. If so the
yachts will start from Sandy Hook
lightship and run almost dead before
the wind down the Jersey coast to a
point just beyond Long Branch.
According to a dispatch received
from Monmouth Beach Life-saving
Station at 10 o'clock to-nl|?ht then- will
1>Â« quite a heavy sea off Sandy Hook
to-morrow unless the wind moderates
or shifts to some other quarter.
The cup defender Columbia was the
first boat of the two to be measured.
When the telltale on the caisson
showed that there was twelve feet of
water in the dock the Columbia floated.
but in order to be sure the ship was off
the blocks the water continued to flow
until there was about four inches short
of twenty-eight feet. John Hyslop, the
official measurer of the New York Club,
who has put the tape on many a cup
challenger and defender in past years,
performed the task again to-day. He
arrived at the navy-yard shortly be
fore 8 o'clock and at once commenced
work getting the length of the boom
eraff. mast and spinnaker pole. The
crew rendered all tlv- assistance they
could and a man was hoisted In a
boatswain's chair m tbe t,,p to carry
the tape to the head of the topmast.
In measuring the length of the spinna
ker boom it was found that the pole
was about three inches longer than the
restrictions allowed -that is, from the
center of the bowsprit between fib and
jib topsails stays to the mast was a
quarter of a foot too long. Captain
Barr called into requisition a flne
toothed saw and cut two inches from
one end and one inch from the other
of the spinnaker pole.
The plans were mad- to measure the
water line and over all lengths of the
bo.nt. The crew\and C. Oliver Iselin,
Captain Woodbury Kane, Herbert C.
Leeds. W. Butler Duncan Jr. of the
Defender, Harry F. Lipnitt of th<Â»
America's cup committee, Hugh C.
Kelley, secretary of the Royal Ulster
Yacht Club, who will sail on the Co
lumbia as Sir Thomas Lipton's repre
sentative in the cup races, J. Connell,
also of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club,
Captain Nat Herreshoff and Mrs. C.
Oliver Tselin were aboard the American
boat when the hull was measured. Mrs.
lselin. Mr. Duncan and Secretary
Kelley were In the cabin engaged in
conversation, while all the others on
board with the exception of Nat Her
reshoff, Captain Barr and Mr. Con
nell were placed amidships in order to
bring the boat down evenly to the 1
wa *â¢ r line.
Mr. Herreshoff, Captain Barr and Mr.
ConnffH assisted Measurer Hyslop in
getting the figures. The forward over
hang was first measured. A plumb line
was suspended from the very tip of
the boom, and, getting into a boat. Mr.
Hyslop. by means of a long measuring
rod, got the length from the plumb to
the water line on the bow. The after
overhang â was obtained In a similar
manner, and after these dimensions
were obtained the measurer applied the
tape from the taffrail to the bow to get
the length over all. After making a few
calculations Mr. Hyslop announced to
Messrs. Iselin and Herreshoff the result
of his measurements.
Evidently the figure was somewhat
less than the managing owner desired
to sail the Columbia on. for a dozen
men were set ashore in the tender, and,
going to the steam tender Plymouth,
carried over to the Columbia twenty
pigs of lead, aggregating about 1700
pounds in weight. Previous to taking
the measurement a lot of dunnage was
brought up from the Columbia's cabin
and put in several large row boats, as
it was the intention of th<^ captain to
cl>\tn out from the hull all movable ar
ticles.
Mr. Leeds stated that the pigs of lead
were placed in the Columbia to make
up for the lops of weight occasioned by
the removal of the dunnage, but it was
noticed that when the ballast had been
added the Columbia sat lower in the
water than shn <1 id before. Then Mr.
Hyplop measured her line again and the
length, 89.66 1-100 inches, proving satis
factory to the owner and Designer
Herreshoff, a V-shaped mark in red

BETTING IN FAVOR
OF THE COLUMBIA
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â There was very
little betting on the yacht races to
night arc-und the hotels. In fact, the
element which usually has money for
the bis yacht races was of the opinion
that the betting interest this year is
helnw the average. It is thought
however, that it will pick up after to

THE ADMIRAL
FROM GOTHAM
NEW YORK, Oct. 2.â Admiral Dewey
arose early this morning and began prep
arations for his departure at 1 o'clock for
Washington. After a light breakfast, dur

of his family, the admiral expressed him
self as being much refreshed after the
fatiguing incidents of the past week. He
saw no visitors this morning, but kept
to his room, attending to some personal
business until about 11 o'clock, when, with
the party escorting him, he started for a
drive before proceeding to the railway
station.
Mayor Van Wyck called about 10 o'clock
and had a short talk with the admiral,
to whom he bade good-by. Before he

to-day received a telegram from Major
Scobel, who is now in St. Louis, asking
authority for himself and staff to pass
from New Orleans into Texas without

RECEPTION
TENDERED TO
ARCHBISHOP
Students Accord Honors to
the Distinguished Pre
late of This City.
VISITS NOTRE DAME.
â¦ â
Interesting Day Spent by the
Churchman at the University He
Attended Many Years Ago.
J D
Srortal rMspatch to ThÂ« Tall.
NOTRE DAME, Ind., Oct. 2.â One of
the most enthusiastic receptions ever
accorded an alumnus of Notre Dame
was that given Archbishop Riqrdan
of San Francisco to-day by the faculty
and students of Notre Dame University.
The prelate's visit was entirely unoffi
cial. He came simply to visit the uni
versity, which he attended as a student
forty-three years ago. He sought to
come quietly, but the news that he
would reach Notre Dame to-day had
preceded him and he was heartily wel
comed.
The large refectory, where most of
the upper classmen take their meals,
was decorated with ferns and the uni
versity orchestra played during the
dinner hour. Afternoon lectures were
discontinued owing to the arrival of
the distinguished guest. Archbishop
Riordan spent the day meeting new
members of the faculty. Late In the af
ternoon a party of ecclesiasts, of which
Archbishop Riordan was a member.
visited St. Mary's Academy. At the
conclusion of the dinner in the senior
refectory at Notre Dame, 14. G. O'Mal-
I ley greeted the Archbishop as follows:
"We students <>f this university ten
der you. Its honored alumnus, greet
ing which Notre Dame men extend
: only to one another. Though nothing
of sincerity can be added to this wel
j come, we must thank you for the kind
! favor of your visit. We know you as a
: distinguished churchman, and so we
: derive n<>t only pleasure but benefit
' from your presence here. Such occa
sions as this are Important educational
factors, supplementing the work of the
, faculty, for we learn not alone by the
study of moral and intellectual princl
p es, but by inspiration drawn from the
: living embodiment of these. We can
-1 not hope, on account of the distance
of your home from us, to see you as
often as we should wish, but we trust
your convenience will give us the pleas
j ure again soon. For your kindness in
rdlng us this opportunity of in
struction we assure you of our deep
gratitud >."
The remarks were so filled with good
feeling and good fellowship that the
Archbishop reconsidered his determina
tion not to address the students, and
made a most eloquent speech. He said
in part:
"I wish to say to you, my dear young
men, that the great question of to-day
in this country is not the question of
imperialism or expansion; It is not the
question of gold or silver; it is not the
question of the opening of new lines
of railways or harbor communications
with distant islands, but the question
Is, what kind of men are we going to
have? That is the question to be solved
in the schools and colleges of the land."
CO-OPERATION IN THE
TREATMENT OF NATIVES
Important Motion Presented to In
ternational Geographical Con
gress for Action.
BERLIN, Oct. 2.â Dr. Nansen. the Arc
tic explorer, said to-day to a representa
tive of the Associated Press:
"The United States ought to join Great
Britain ami Germany in co-operative ex
ploration. Thus the three progressive na
tions would work for the common good of
mankind and science. If the polar dis
tricts are ever to be thoroughly explored,
it will probably be Jue to such joint ac
tlun."
Poultney Blgelow has presented a writ
ten motion for adoption by the Interna
tional Geographical Congress to the ef
fect that hereafter each colonial power
pledges itself to submit such new methods
or questions relative to the treatment of
natives as may come up from time to
time to a permanent international com
mittee empowered to decide upon them.
This proposition coincides with that of
Andrew D. White, the United States Em
bassador hero, made at the recent peace
conference at The Hague.

Special Cable to The Call and the New Ynrk
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, Oct. 2.â The Insurgents
cut the telegraph line between Bacoor
and Manila at 8 o'clock to-night, and
this message to Manila had to be sent
t Jin 'Ugh by water.
The rebels made an attack upon Ba
coor at half-past 8 o'clock this morning
and the fight lasted until dark. Gen
eral Grant conducted the operations of
the American forces in person on the
firing line. The Filipinos first cut the
telegraph wires running from Bacoor
to Imus and ambushed the American
patrol, consisting of eight men. A sig
nal sergeant was killed and two other
Americans were wounded. The little
band was reinforced by a company of
the Fourteenth Infantry and three
companies of the Fourth, which were
hurriedly sent out from Imus and
fought their way through along the
road to their relief.
The rebels were lighting at 4 o'clock
this afternoon from across a deep river
fifty yards wide. Kight men in all of
the American troops had been wounded
up to that time and two had been
killed. An advance will be made to
morrow on the insurgents.
General Alejandrino, head of the
Filipino military commission now con
ferring with General Otis, said in an in
terview with The Call-Herald cor
respondent:
"â¢ >ur government Is willing to ac
cept a protectorate under the United
States. We fought Spain because we
did not wish longer to be a colony. A
colonial government under American
rule wuuld be worse than Spanish, be
cause you know nothing about the wnv
to govern colonies. We do not want
to be experimented on for a century
while you learn how. With England it
would be another matter.
"You are another race and are not
in sympathy wirh us. We know how
to rule our own people. We do not un
derstand why your powerful nation
wants to crush us like insects. You
can conQuer us because you are rich
and our soldiers cannot fight success
fully against yours. We want an hon
orable peace, but we will fight until
death for our institution?. We know
every military move that you make
and get every day local American
newspapers. We know what thu
United States papers say. We believe
that a few men. whom you call politi
( i-irs are waging this war. and that
the people of the United ' States will
soon change in our favor.
"Admiral Dewey promised me in
Hongkong that at the termination of
the war with Spain the Filipinos would
be given their independence. Dewey
was our best friend, but we understand
now that he will not be permitted to
keep his word with us. We do not un
derstand why General Otis refuses to
rorn^nize our government unless he is
afraid that other foreign powers will
then recognize us."
In an hour's interview with the com
mission they gave many evidences of
their purpose to make efforts to se
cure recognition as a nation before
making any attempt at treating for
peace. They also showed much depres
sion over their complete failure in the
battles with the American troops and
also full recognition of the fact that
If the campaign against them was pros
ecuted vigorously by Otis it must mean
their uttei defeat soon.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â A dispatch
from General Otis was received at the
War Department this morning giving
an account of his meeting with the in
surgent envoys. General Otis said the
Interview with Aguinaldo's representa
tives indicated that the leaders were
maneuvering solely with a view to se
cure recognition of the insurgent gov
ernment. All such overtures were re
jected and the envoys were informed
that the only thJng the United States
would recognize was a white flag and
the grounding of arms. He also in
formed the envoys that such capitula
tion on the part of th* 1 insurgents
should come quickly in order to avoid
the consequences of active war, as the
United States did not intend to permit
any delay in the matter.
The course of General Otis is ap
proved at the War Department.
Secretary Root took the dispatch
from General Otis over to the White
House for the President's considera
tion.
NO OFFICIAL ADVICES
OF THE BACOOR FIGHT
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.â No official ad
vices had been received up to midnight
concerning' the engagement with the in
surgents at Bacoor by troops under Gen
eral Grant. There are about 7000 troops
under command of Generals Grant an.d
young south of Manila and within easy
roach of Bacoorâ a force ample, the au
thorities say, to cope with the number of
Insurgents supposed to be in that vicinity.
General Otis has sent wonl of the re
lease of the American prisoners held by
the Filipinos and of his refusal to recog
nize the so-called Filipino Government.
This action of the commander has re
ceived the entire approval of the Presi
dent and Secretary Root. It is stated
that the general made it plain to the Fili
pino envoys that nothing but uncondi
tional surrender would be considered by
this Government, and It is Intended to
stand by this declaration, even after the
fall operations begin and no matter how
sincerely the insurgents may beg for
peace.

After the court had risen a represen
tative of the Associated Press called on

fessed ignorance as to how the award
would go. Mr. Harrison did not seem
anxious regarding the subject.
H. Vignaud, secretary of the Ameri
can Embassy, who called upon Mr.
Harrison at the same time, said the
latter's argument was very much ap
preciated by the court. To this Mr.
Harrison replied:
"We did our best in what I know is
a right cause, but in an arbitral tri
bunal such as this it is a toss-up. It
doi'P not resemble an ordinary tribunal
to the judges of which it is absolutely
immaterial which party wins. I hold
that for international disputes there
should be a permanent arbitration
court.. as I did when questioned on the
subject, and not men specially ap
pointed for a given object.

EARTHQUAKE DESTROYED
ONE THOUSAND LIVES
The Latest Reports From the Devastated Dis
trict in Asia Minor Give Most
Appalling Results.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Oct. 2.â lt is now estimated that lfiOO Persians per
ished in the earthquakes in Asia Minor, around Aidin. The first shock oc
curred at 4 o'clock in the morning of September 20 and lasted forty sec
onds. The effects were appalling. Whole villages were completely destroyed.
The earthquake was felt as far as Scio, Mitylene and Smyrna.
The latest advices from the stricken area show that men, women and
children were buried in the ruins of their dwellings before they realized
their danger. Numbers of bodies still lie beneath the debris. About 600 per
sons were killed at Sarakeni and some 500 at Denizli, where three-fourths
of the buildings fell. There was proportionate losb of life in many of the
smaller villages.
The disturbance has not yet subsided, although its strength appears to be
spent. The shocks continue almost dnily, but vrlth no great violence. The
population is encamped in the open.
One consequence of the earthquake is the subsidence of the level of the
Aidin district t>y two yards. Sulphurous springs burst out in the valley of
Xoander, and the country between Aidin and Denizli became full of crev
ices, out of which rushed black, muddy water with sufficient volume to
wash away a tlock of 1000 sheep.
The villagers of the valley of Noander report that for several days pre
vious to the catastroph" domestic animals were greatly disturbed, sheep
bleating and dogs barking.
CARNIVAL OF
THE DEMOCRATS
Enthusiastic Gathering
at Dallas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
; DALLAS, Tex.. Oct. 2.â There vrete fully
10,000 persons on the grand stand at the
Fair Grounds when the distinguished per
sons who have come from points outside
of â  the State to attend the Democratic
carnival put in an appearance. As the
leaders mounted the stand they were
loudly applauded. When Mr. Bryan ap
peared, it was as if the sound which em
anated from the thousands of throats
would tear out their linings.
â  Among those present were: Hon. O. 11.
j'. Belmont . and Congressman William
(Suiter of. New York, ex-Governor Stone,
Major H. W. Salmons of St. Louis, ex-
State Treasurer of Missouri; Colonel M.
C. Wetmore of St. Louis, the anti-trust
millionaire: Governor D. A. Jones of Ar
kansas; Governor Joseph 1). Sayei of
Texas, Congressman Champ Clark of Mis
souri; ex-Govern T. T. Crittenden of
Missouri; J. G. Johnson of Kansas, chair
man of the National Democratic Execu
tive Committee: Sam B. Cook, chairman
of the State Democratic. Executive Com
mittee of Missouri and manager of the
w&ys and means, committee of the. Demo
cratic National Executive Committee;
Congressman J. W. Bailey, R. 1". Henry
and R. ]â '. Burke; l"u;i. d States Senator
Horace Chilton. Hon. Thomas Campbell
and many Texas leaders. In addition there
were also present:- Colonel Fred Fleming,
James: A. Reid and L,. F. Wilson, all of
Kansas City, who are here for the pur
pose of booming that city as the location
of the next National Convention of that
party. ' â¢
Ex-Governor Stone was the first speak
er. At the close of his speech the temper
of the meeting was manifested by cries of
"Bryan! Bryan!" in stentorian tones from
every portion of the throng, varied with
calls for "Belmont! Belmont! get up and
show yourself." The crowd would take
no refusal; and from his seat in the back
end- of the speakers' stand the New
Yorker arose to receive an ovation. The
calls that reached his ears were long
drawn out and of terrific volume. It was
the old "rebel 11."
Governor Jones of Arkansas was the
next speaker. When Governor Jones
closed there were prolonged cries for Mr.
Bryan. . :
The programme arranged for the morn
ing had not been completed and his time
.had not yet arrived; The calls continuing,
he responded in a short talk, party or
ganization being his theme. He did not
believe all votes cast for him the last
time were counted and thought many were
counted against him which were not cast.
The Democratic party did not have the
advantage in 1896 of such an organization
in the beginning of the campaign as It
had now. .The rank and file of the party
had been fighting ever since the polls
closed and in defeat had been more hope
ful of success in lfÂ»<>o ever since the elec
tion day than the Republican party In
victory.'
Congressman Bailey, Democratic leader
of the House, and Senator Chilton then
spoke. Th- Inner wheel In the carnival
is the Senatorial race In Texas. Senator
Chilton will stand for re-election and it la
generally understood that Mr. Bailey will
oppose him.
At the afternoon meeting the crowds
were larger, if anything, than in the
morning. General- Cabel presided and
Congressman Champ Clark of Missouri,
Congressman Hugh Dinsmore of Arkan
sas and ex-Governor Adams of Colorado
were the speakers.

INSPECTED A
HYDRAULIC MINE
Day of Pleasure for Vis
iting- Engineers.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 2.â The party of
mining- engineers to-day, after having
breakfasted at Colfax and seen the opera
tion of hydraulic mines, went to Auburn
for a brief luncheon and welcome at noon,
I and the late afternoon and evening were
| spent In Sacramento. A visit to Dutch
Flat was also one of the features of the
day. When the party landed there it had
| a splendid scenic view of a stretch of
mountainous country over which great
I white and red scars visibly traced twenty
| three miles of ancient river channels
along which the hydraulic operations of
a generation ago flourished.
The visitors saw the only operating
; hydraulic mine in all that region.
| This was the Polar Star hy
! draulic mine, controlled and superin
tended by William Nicholls Jr. This
is the dry season, but 2000 inches ot
water were turned on for an hour to
"liable the miners to fully operate two
8-inch nozzles in the pit, while the crowd
wondered and admired and took snap
shots. A kinetoscope man. took the
scene to display at the Paris Exposition.
It was a striking object lesson, not only
in hydraulir mining- operations, but in the
vast possibilities of hydraulic mining re
maining in California.
At Auburn the speeches attending 1 the
luncheon were specially felicitous. At Sac
ramento the Crocker Art Gallery and But
ter's Fort were first visited, and after
dinner the party assembled in the Capitol
building 1 , which was open and lighted
throughout In honor of the visitors. A
very pleasant season of speech-making
attended the assemblage of the party in
the State Library.
RAILROAD FAVORS THE
TEXAS QUARANTINE
Will Have Nothing to Do With the
Action to Have It
Broken.
AUSTIN. Oct. 2.â Advices reached here
to-day that the Board of Trade of New
Orleans is the instigator of the injunction
proceedings that were to be instituted in
the Supreme Court of the United States to
break the Texas yellow fever Quarantine
against that city. The suit is now in
course of preparation and will probably
be filed October i" .it Washington.
State Health Officer w. S. Blunt to-day
received a copy oi the following telegram
sent by General Manager <;. Q. Van vleck
of the Southern Pacific Company to J. T.
Kay of I ,v < Orleans:
"] notice a special telegram from New
Orleans to the effect that New Orleans
will go before the United States Supreme
Court in an effort to break the Texas
quarantine. We will have nothing to do
with the proposition, for the following
reasons:
"If the Texas Health Officer is enjoined
orange or Beaumont will unquestionably
put on a local quarantine and tie us up
completely. If they should get an in
junction we would, as a matter of self
protection, appeal to the Governor. They
cannot enjoin him, and we cannot afford,
by reason of the action taken by New Or
leans, to run the risk of having our track
torn up and our bridges destroyed, and I
would ask that you decline to furnish any
information unless it is under legal pro
cess."
WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS FOR CARTER
The Captain, Convicted by Court-
Martial, Granted Temporary
Respite From Prison.
NEW STORK, Oct. 2.â Judge E. Henry
Lacombe of the United States Cifcuit
Court granted to-day the application for
a writ of habeas corpus made by counsel
in behalf of former Captain Oberlln M.
Carter, convicted by court-martial of con
spiring to defraud the Government out
of about $I.7OO.ikhj while in charge of the
harbor improvements work at Savannah
Ga.
The plea for the writ was made by Ab
ram J. Rose and the order was made re
turnable before Judge Lacombe at 11
o'clock Wednesday morning. It was held
by counsel that under the articles of war
< arter could not be punished by both fine
and imprisonment, but should have been
sentenced to suffer one or the other of
the penalties.
The writ will be served on General Mer
ritt and Captain Roberta to-morrow morn
ing and this will prevent his immedite
transfer to Leavenworth prison. Carter
was notified to-night of the granting of
the writ and his friends hope the outcome
will be to save him from further impris
onment.

SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 2.â Joel H.
Cooper, a prominent attorney of this
county and an ex- Assemblyman, was
found* dead last evening in his rooms in
this city. He had a severe hemorrhage,
and being unable to call for assistance,
aied alone. He had retired about 9 o'clock
and about 10 o'clock parties walking along
State street and under the room occupied
by Cooper heard and saw blood dropping
upon the sidewalk. An officer was called
dethes sitting in a chaii with his head
hanging out of the window In several
laces in the room there were quantities
of blood. The supposition is that he broke
a Wood vessel wiuU coughing and rushed
to the door to call someone, but when he

window and there became exhauste^:
M..r<- than a bucketful of blood was up

THE Democratic Municipal Conven
tion Justified Its existence last night ,
by rooking Native Sons' Hall a
scene of â wild disorder and by subÂ»
mitting- to a dictatorship that Buck- '
ley In his palmiest days would not
have dared to assume. ThÂ© delegates
were there, to do as they were ordered.
They could not venture an Individual
opinion or a vote,, and In substitute for
{both they groaned, cheered, hissed, cat
called and howled until the hall was bed
lam and. the chairman, Jasper McDonald,
became the butt of coarse Jokes and every
ribald jest that rowdies cared to fling at
his head. But that was the sum of the
rebellion. ThÂ© delegates voted the pro
gamme which McNab had prepared.
\ There were two protests, but they were
weak in effect if not in noise.
"Break the slate" was shouted from the
galleries and among the delegates, but the
slate as not broken. Some of the worthy
representatives of Democracy kicked In
the traces like stubborn mules, but the
-.bit was too firmly fixed and they were
whipped back again in line. The chair
man made rulings that brought a roa*
from the stubborn ones a.nd a smile to the
faces of the tractable, but his rulings
were sustained. And there were some In
dependent epirits in the convention that
chafed under the humiliation of being
more insultingly led than they ever had
been und< the regime which "reform"
' politics has superseded.
It was perhaps five minutes before
. Chairman McDonald was floundering in
his own rulings. Appeals were taken from
. his â¢ decisions and with the perspiration.
making a full moon of his face he de
' clared himself out of order, sustained
an appeal, than rescinded it and tin tiiy
. guzca oh the cat-calling crowd with a
: look that asked lor assistance. With the
tiicJ of several secretaries he was released
iroiu his entanglement and ordered the
â reading of the platform.
..The document discusses everything from
"The white Man's Burden" to the neces
sity of keeping the streets clean. Every
thing Democratic is lauded and every
thing Republican condemned. It Is re
marKable, perhaps, for two elementsâ its
extreme length and Us significant silence
in reference to the national Democratic
platform adopted at Chicago. This alienee
proved to be the Joker oi the evening.

consume the next thirty minutes of the
convention by the reading of typewritten
manuscript, wherein the Democracy of
ban Francisco reasserted again Its belief

Mayor Phelani Assessor Dodge, City and
County Attorney Lane nd Supervisors
I>yingtpn and Deasy were lauded to the
skies. Ihe pledge was read committing
the nominees of the convention to adher
ence to the civil service provisions of the
new charter, to support of the movement
for new pavements and new sewers to
the extension of the park panhandle and
for the connection of the park with the
Presidio. It advocated the doctrine of

further the platform declares the ac

the convention to proceed with all dili
gence to the reconstruction and repair of
existing school buildings and the erection
of modern buildings where the demands
of the population require them. In the

The reading of the platform contained
also a paragraph announcing the oppo
sition of the delegates to the Introduction
Into political ana social life of religious
tests, and condemned any effort to
abridge the provisions of the constitution
of the country with respect to absolute
religious freedom.
The reading was concluded with a de
nunciation ot trusts and a condemnation
of the present Democratic municipal of
fioe holders and a declaration mat the
platform must be signed by ail candi
dates within ten days of their nomina
tion.
No sooner had Mag'uire ceased from '
reading than E. C. Harrison was on his
feet to hurl the tlrst brick at the slate
H was a heavy missile and well aimed.
"I move," h>- thundered at the chair.
"as an amendment to the platform re
ported that it contain a resolution declar
ing Ineligible for nomination by this con
vention any member of the convention."
One could imagine that he beard a
house fall, so numerous were the cries
of "Good boy!" Sit down:" "What's
eatin' ye?" and similar questions that
were hurled at the amender through the
gaps in the applause. Maguire, who had
[â¢ported the plat from, arose to defend it
from this ass-ault In the house of its
friends. He arose to the point of orn>i
that the resolution contemplated by thÂ»
amendment of Harrison could not be con
tained In the platform, but should be
submitted as a plain resolution, to be re
ferred in Its due course to the committee
on resolutions.
The chair decided the point of order
well taken, and the fighting blood of i
Harrison flew to the top of the glass.
"I appeal from the decision of the
chair." exclaimed Mr. Harrison. "I ap
from the decision of the chair."
"Wow!" how the Harrisonites yelled. I
"No! No!" came from all over the |

â  hair had gained Its second wind by j
this time and was coming to, like a pugll- j
Ist 'Hinting- the fateful ten Beconds. He
stammered and muttered a little and
raise 1 , his voice to announce that a divis
ion had beÂ«-n called for, and he would put
the motion .again. This brought a rÂ»mnn-
Btrance from Harrison, who Insisted that :
the chair had ruled that his appeal had
been sustained by the chair. Mr. McDon
ald was in an awkward fix, and misht
have be*Â»n there yet had not a kindly lot ,
of friends of the slate pot in with uproar ,
enough to drown a Niagara. By the time
that had subsided McDonald was himsHf
again. HÂ«- calmly put the question again, ;
and by rare intelligence and without the
aid of a teller [lucked victory for the
chair and- the slat* out of a chaos of dele- i
gates. So cleverly did ho do It that his
decision was announced before the "noes"
had a chance, to vote, it larred him
somewhat to do it, however, for he was i
about, to pass over the platform without '
the formality of indorsing it. when hla !
attention was called to thr> matter, and!
the eulogy of all thinps Democratic was I
sent through with a whoop.
Del. -gate Kdrlmann thought this was a
good time for him to pet in with his reso- i
lutlon. and he bobbed up again with a \
demand that he be heard. He was
promptly Â«hut off by the chair, who by
; this time had got a rtrm prip on the pro
; gramme and did not propose to be shied
off the track by any such proposition. He
announced that the committee on order
of business would report, and J. V. Whit
ing read the results of that committee's
I labors. It recommended that nominations
be made in the following order: Super
visors. Mayor. Assessor, City and County
Attorney. Public Administrator, Coroner
Tax Collector, Treasurer, Auditor. Sheriff,
County Clerk, District Attorney, Recorder
and Police Judges. A motion to adopt this
order of business was prevented from
sliding through with the smoothness cal
culated by reason of the arising of Dele
pate Harrison with the resolution that
raised the preliminary row. It war.
promptly declared out of order and the

clamored for the ear of the chairman.
He got it at last and was told that he |
; was In order. He started at once to read !
his precious document, only to be inter- j
: rupted by cries of "Platform." "Plat
-1 form," until in sheer desperation he was
forced to mount the dread eminence.
"I offer the following resolution," he
said, "and move that It be adopted by
thls convention." Then he read: "Re
solved. That this convention reaffirm the
principles enunciated in the platform
adopted by the Democratic national con
vention at Chicago In 1896."
Del' pate T. J. 1- itzsimmons, whose locks
are Â«it the shade of the once "champ."
made his way to the front of the hall and
In loud tones called upon the assembled
delegates to declare themselves for or
against the Chicago platform. In the lan
: guage of the street, Fitzsimmons was
given the "haha" and returned to his se.tt
growling and ready to take issue with the
llrst man that knocked the chip off his
; shoulder.
The unexpected Fitzslmmons disposed
i of, the chair announced that the conven
tion was ready to proceed with the order
Of business. He declared that nomina
tions for Supervisors were In order. The
chairman of that committee announced
that It had not finished Its labors and
begged to be excused until the next meet
ing. Tt was so ordered, and the; chair
asked for nominations for Mayor.
J. V. Whiting took the platform and in
a short address placed the name of James
D. Phelan before the convention. There
was considerable cheering as he finished.
Edward I. Coffey, the Judge's nephew,
moved that the nomination be made unan
imous and somebody else moved that the
secretary he Instructed to cast the vote
uf the convention for the Mayor. This
was done amid much cheering. Out of It
arose the pale hair of Mr. FitZSlmmonS,
who. the more he had thought apparently
of his intention to have the committee
Â»Â»o on record concerning the Chicago con
vention, the angrier he grew. His face
i was fairly livid as he demanded recogni
tion from the chair.
Quiet again relfrncd. and a motion was
; made by a man in the amen corner that
a committee of two he appointed to escort
' the Mayor to the platform. He was in-

formed that such action would be taken
later.
Nominations for Assessor being In order,
Charles A. Swelgert took the platform to
present the name of Dr. Washington
Dodge. His purpose was guessed and he
was applauded and for the next five min
utes he filled the arid wastes of oratory
with all the posies from MeGuffey's series
of readers In eulogy of his candidate. The
same procedure was taken as followed the
nomination of Phelan and the secretary
cast the ballot of the convention for
Dodge for Assessor.
Franklin K. LanÂ© was nominated for
City and County Attorney to succeed
himself by Andrew G. Mayuire and his
nomination was carried In the same man
ner as that of the Mayor and the Assessor.
When It came, however, to naming the
candidate for Public Administrator, there
occurred the first hitch In the programme.
Louis de F. Bartlett named Patrick Bo
land. E. C. Harrison, who had caused the
first breeze of the evening, arose to make
the second. He presented the name of
George Maxwell. He was met with a
statement from the chair that the nomina
tions had been declared closed, although
nobody in the neighborhood had heard
any such declaration.
Lionel cries of "no" came from all part*
of the hall, and the chair thought better
of it, allowing the name of Maxwell tÂ« > go
before the convention, the Boland men
demanding that Harrison pnngle up the
$10 nomination fee, although such method
had not been insisted upon up to this
time and although Roland's nominator
had not paid his eagle.
It began to look for a minute as If there
were breakers ahead for the slate. There
was eonsiri-rable hard breathing and
many open manifestations of ill feeling.
What might have come of it all will never
be known, for the reason that Mr. Max
well, in whose favor Harrison had first
Introduced the "Ineligible" resolution, in
order to shut out iiolaml. who was a dele
gate, ;iros. ; and asked that his name be
withdrawn. His wishes were acceded to
with gle<\ and Boland was elected unani
mously, although there were many loud
crie* of "no."
The bitterest feeling of the evening- was
started when the nominations for Coroner
were called for. T. B. I. eland named I Jr.
It. Beverly Cole, and E I. Coffey put in
nomination the Incumbent, Dr. E. E. Hill.
On motion the vote was taken by dele
gations, although mor- than one voice
was raised in protest at this proceeding
Rollcalls were repeatedly asked and the
balloting proceeded amid a thunder of
noises, made principally by the Hill sup
porters, who, as the vote showed, were
stronger in the lobby than the conven
tion. Before the last district had an
nounced its preferences it became plain
that it was all off with Hill. Even while
the secretary was footing up the totals
there were three cheers for Cole and a
like number for Hill.
The chair announced that Dr. Pole had
received 220 votes to 113 for Hill, and he
declared Cole the nominee of the conven
tion. Delegate Ooffey moved that the
nomination of Cole be made unanimous
and, jus-t to show how the Democrat- of
the convention love one another, there
was a storm of noes. Objector Harrison
arose to a point of order that the nomi
nation was not unanimous
"All right." replied the chair; "we will
have to let it stand that it's not unani
mous," and he did.
Richard P. Doolan, nominated by
Thomas Hickey for Tax Collector, had no
I opposition and was chosen unanimously.
'ihe convention then adjourned to meet

-^ NOTHER session of the Republican
I \ caucus at B'nai B'rith Hall last
t^\ night engaged the attention of a"s-
I " pirants for municipal office. One
" hundred and eighty-one delegates
participated in the proceedings and re
newed their determination to stand to
gether in the main convention to-night.
The committee appointed to recommend
candidates for the Board of Supervisors
reported progress and promised to submit
a list o-f names to the caucus to-morrow
evening.
An animated session of the committee^
on platform and resolutions (Judge Schell
chairman) was held at the hall before the
caucus was called to order. Delegate
Joseph K. Jones of the Thirty-seventh
Assembly District came in late and ascer
tained that a plank of education which ha
had presented at a previous meeting was
eliminated or abridged. When the fact
of the abridgment was made known to
him he impulsively withdrew the entire
plank and plainly indicated that his as
sociates had not acted in good faith. He
declared that the educational plank had
not only received the indorsement of the
sub-committee but had been accepted by
the whole committee. He sought to as
certain the reason why it had been reject
ed in his absence. His demand for light
on this branch of the subject elicited the
statement that the executive committee
did not commend the resolution. The sug
gestion that outside influences had been
invoked aroused the ire of Delegate
Jones. He reminded his fellow-members
that the sentiments expressed in the reso
lution met the unqualified commendation
of President David Starr Jordan of the
Stanford University and other progressive
educators.
Following Is the plank which Judge
ScheH's platform-builders decided to mend
or reject:
In harmony â with the genius of our Govern
ment and the traditions of the Republican
party, we believe that there is a vital rela
tion between Intelligence and freedom, and that
education is the essential equipment of full
orbed citizenship. To the extent that it Is
general and competent, to that extent are poli
tical rights accurately determined and effect
ively conserved and political duties adequately
appreciated and faithfully performed.
A frte, self-governing people must not only
be an educated people, but that education
must meet the demands of the increasing com
plexity and comtietitlon of our day, and the
marvelous unfoldlr.es of life and mind In and
about us.
In so far as this municipality can legiti
mately foster. It should supplement the efforts
'>: our great universities In giving -our com
monwealth a higher conception of citizenship
and a clearer view of Its functions and privi
leges. Furthermore, up to a like measure, it
should aid the same influences in not only mak
ing Kan Francisco and its environments the
Intellectual center of the State, but also the
educational objective of the Pacific Coast. To
this end our common schools should have a
larger share of public interest and municipal
care. The curriculum thereof should keep step
not only with the demands and eventualities
of practical life, but also plant the incipient
terms, at least, of that mental equipoise and
Wise determinative Judgment which should
characterize the sovereign unit of a free peo
ple. The teachers should be the best the pro
fession can furnish. Incompetence should have
no place in the School Department, no matter
how high the social position or strong the
political Influence. The best Is none too good,
and should be paid for at a rate and in a way
to secure the best. A cheap school teacher is
the dearest article In which a republic can in
vest. Hence the financial affairs of the School
Department should be administered with such
discretion and honesty as to amply provide for
full and prompt payment of its teachers' sal
aries.
Dishonesty In a municipality is as reprehen
sible as dishonesty In an individual. In brief,
the Republican party pledges itself to place our
public schools in the highest state of efficiency,
educationally and financially.
It would be no surprise if the war over
this plank should be carried into the main
convention to-night. â .--".
At one stage of the proceedings the cau
cus was on the verge of a tumult. Chair
man Kellogg saw the danger ahead and
averted a scene of disorder. A delegate
who was evidently displeased at the
report of the committee appointed to pass
upon the merits of aspirants for Police
Court Judge insinuated thai the report
was not honest. A dozen delegates sprang
up to "hurl back" the insult. Delegate
I. J. Truman Jr. created a sensation by
hints of disclosures made in executive ses
sion of the committee. He said charges
had been made and sustained which re
flected on the honor of two candidates
who had been eulogized in nominating
speeches. Mr. Truman said that he could
not mention names, but intimated that
prominent attorneys had made and proved
the charges before a secret session of the
Chairman Kellogg called the caucus to
order promptly at 8:30 o'clock. A rollcall
being taken, it was found there were few
absentees among the delegates. The chair
announced that the first order of busi
ness would be the nomination of a City
and County Attorney, but there being no
nominations the matter was passed. A
call was then msde for the report of the
committee on Police Judges.
Delegate Edmond Tauszky arose and ad
vised that before the report was made
nominations should be made. He sug
| gested this course, as the convention
j would thus be able to collect $10 from
i each candidate put in nomination. The
; wise suggestion was received with ap-
I plause and was at once put into practice.
, George C. Sargent renewed an old mo
; tion to limit the sppech.es to five minutes,
and then Delegate F. P. Haynes of the
1 Thirty-seventh District caught the chair
man's eye and took the floor. He said
that he had the pleasure of placing: be
j fore the caucus for its consideration for
â¢ the office of Police Judge the name of a
i gentleman who has filled the office cred
itably for the last nine months; that if
I nominated ho would certainly fill it for
the next term. He said the gentleman
I had no enemies in his party; that if nor
n: mated he would have the support of a
â¢ large number of young wn in the Demo
| cratic party, and that his success was
I already assured. He said the nnme he
had the honor of presenting to the cau
; cus was Judge Thomas Graham. When
| the applause that greeted the name had
subsided he continued: "This gentleman
! has got to make a harder tight than sev
eral others who will be here this even
ing, on account of the fact that accord
; ing to your now charter he is disquali
fied. The fact should not stand in his
; way, inasmuch that that particular sec
; tion has been pronounced unconstitu-
I tional by the best lawyers in this city.
And. gentlemen, after a grave considera
tion of that question, I have come to the
conclusion that it is no bar to his chances
of success and should not stand in the
way of your giving him your vote. I
earnestly trust in considering these can
' didatep you will not allow that section of
the charter to militate against his choice
as one of our Police Judges."
In quick succession Delegates W. H. R.
! McMartin, T. \\\ Dennis and Howard
Harron arose and in eulogistic speeches
seconded the nomination.
James B. Barber placed James L. Nagle
in nomination. He said that he arose to
place a gentleman in nomination who had
practiced law in this city for a .number
of years, and that during that period the
finger of scorn had never pointed against
him for any dishonest action on his part;
that he had fulfilled all the qualifications
for the nomination, and If given it he
would win the office surely; that if elect
ed he would be an honor to the bench
and the Republican party. George W.
Elder, Mr. McMartin, G. G. Hillman and
another gentleman from the Thirty-ninth
District added their meed of praise in sec
onding the nomination of Mr. Nagle.
Edmond Tauszky was the next speaker,
and he placed Prosecuting Attorney L. G.
Carpenter in nomination. He said he
arose for the purpose of placing In nom
ination for the office of Police Judge a
gentleman In every res pect qualified for j
the position. He said his candidate had
I lived in this city and county for a great
many years, and possessed all the requi- j
sites-; prescribed by the charter; that he
had a great many friends among Individ
uals and a large following among the
brethren of the press; that he had been
heretofore connected with the press and
that he was earnest and energetic; that
for the last nine months he had acted as
Prosecuting Attorney in the Police Courts.
He had the honor of nominating L. G.
Carpenter.
Percy V. Long seconded the nomination.
Dawson Meyer followed by placing
Judge Henry L. Joachimsen in nomina
tion. He said: "Gentlemen of the caucus:
The gentleman 1 have the great pleasure
of naming to you for Police Judge is well
known to every one in my presence. He
has been before you a great many years.
il<' is- one who has been an officer in this I
municipality prior to the present time, and
Is one whu realizes the Importance of the
position to which he aspires. While on
the bench he wnn the approval of the
merchants of this city and all those who
came before him by reason of the just,
firm and honest way he has acted. The
gentleman 1 have the honor to name this
evening is Henry L. Joachimsen. (Ap
plause.) I need only say to you, gen
tlemen of this caucus, If you will nom
inate the honorable, the fearless Henry
Joachimsen you will make no mistake.
The merchants throughout the commu
nity know him as well as the members
of the bar who have tried cases before
him. and they will all vote for htm if he
is on the ticket." J. H. Humphreys of
the Thirty-seventh District seconded the
nomination in a few fitting sentences.
Judge George W. Schell then arose and
started to nominate E. M. Seamen, but
neglected to pay the $10 assessment. He
was quickly called to account by the del
egates and gracefully yielded the gold
piece. He then delivered an eloquent ap
peal for a nomination for his candidate.
He said he thought the delegates would
delight to vote for him for Judge of the
Police Court of this city and county. His
record was a good oneâ one that any man
mig..: he proud of. "He wears a badge of
the <o ~= .d Army of the Republic," he
said. "He worthily wears it. He defend
ed the flag of this country when treason
was about to sever it. I think he is en
titled to some consideration. I would not
ask for a nomination for that alone. He
is a lawyer, out and out. He was admit
ted to practice in the Supreme Court in
1881, and is In every way worthy and com
petent to perform the duties of a Police
Judge in a capable and able manner. I
assure you he has backbone, and he will
be able to send a man hipher when he
needs it, and down, down, when he ought
to go down. This is the sort of a man
we want. 1 know him well. His name Is
Edward M. Seamen." F. A. Denicke sec
onded the nomination.
J. P. Saunders nominated Judge A. P.
Trcadwell. He spoke highly of the lat
tor's qualities and concluded his eulogy by
saying that for honesty. Integrity and
ability his candidate stood second to
none. "Senator" Leewald seconded the
nomination.
J. B. Boyne was next recognized by the
chairman and in stentorian tones extolled
the virtues of Charles A. Low. He said
he arose to place in nomination a gentle
man who had served the municipality in
the capacity of Police Judge for two terms
and w.is now engaged as Prosecuting At
tornpy in Judge Conion's court. He was
a gentlemen well known to all present.
"lit- may noi have been favorably report
ed on by tho Committee on Police Judges,"
he continued, "but I want delegates in
this caucus to vote for him irrespective
of the committee. (Applause.) I cams
into this convention as a citizen from the
Forty-third District. I am not here
pledged to any many
The speaker was here interrupted by A.
11. Hazell, who. taking umbrage at
Boyne's attack, arose to a point of order,
which was to the effect that the speaker
was attacking a committee that had not
reported. This was passed without action
by the chairman, and Boyne continued:
"I will say again, whether they vote in
his favor or not, it is with you. gentle

KIPLING AND THE KING
'""T^HERE have been signs of flinching in England
as the Boer war feeling has grown. Herbert
* Spencer, representing the extreme of rational
ism, and Cardinal Yaughan, the extreme of super
naturalism, are at one against the war. Literature
and. religion in all time have not forgotten the rights
of the weak and have joined in rebuking the unjust
u;e of a giant's strength. There has been asserted in
England a feeling that it is not a crime in any people
to assert their right to develop institutions in line
with their national or racial genius, ai.a some have
gone so far as to say that the day England fires a
shot as aggressor in the Transvaal will be the begin
ning of the fall of the empire. This may be true, and
yet the present generation may seem tv see in that
act and on that day assurance of the empire's immor
tality. After empires are dead the historian can go
back and find the beginning of their downfall, but it
is usually unseen by those who are cotemporary
with it.
The aversion to this war shown by English thinkers
has evidently made an impression which the British
imperialists feel must be reckoned with. Mr. Rud
yard Kipling is in the habit of illuminating every
seriou3 situation with a flash of his poetic genius,
which lights the whole world at once. The failure of
the Czar's peace conference was sure from the mo
ment he published "Adam Zad the Bear." We may
call it brutal, unjust, inhuman â no matter, it shaped
the policy of the United States and England, and they
issued from a conference called to promote peace on
earth and good will toward men v.ith but one result
of their alliance, and that the retention of the dum
dum bullet in war because it is the crudest missile
that can be fired from a rifle. Adam Zad the Bear
was abroad, and there could be no peace while he
ranged the hills.
This country seemed to be hesitating between the
unselfish purpose of the Spanish war and a new
born greed for power and possessions and the glories
of empire. In that pause Kipling published his
"White Man's Burden," and what to millions had
seemed a national crime appeared as a national duty,
?.nd the brown man has been disappearing from the
face of the earth quite rapidly ever since.
Mr. Kipling had a difficult task to form the Brit
ish conscience in approval of a war pretended to be
for the extension of the franchise and liberty, while
really to crush a rising republic that Britain may have
no rival in South Africa. It must be admitted that
his poem is of less merit than either of its predeces
sors. He professes to see the King come again in
Oom Paul. So he raises the warning voice against
letting the Boers have self-government in the homes
they planted in the wilderness lest the old idea of the
divinely appointed king shall take root in the Dark
Continent, and come again to conquest the world and
rebind its chains on men.
The poem is badly strained. It is cast in the same
stem mold as Adam Zad, but one cannot help feel
ing that it might just as well be fulminated against the
L T nited States, because we fix conditions to naturali
zation and compel a term of years and complete ab
juration of former allegiance before it can be enioyed
at ell. That the Boers choose to fix the terms upon
which aliens may share their birthright is a sign of
the coming of the king again is almost too fantastic
for poetry, and Mr. Kipling has not added to his
fame by setting up such a fallacy. The hard truth is
that the lion and the unicorn want Africa, and intend
to have it regardless of any rights which their holder
is not strong enough to defend.
Oberlin M. Carter, ex-captain in the United States
army, must serve five years in a military prison for
robbing the Government of $1,600,000. Leaving , out
of consideration the element of dishonor, which the
â¦orthy thief seems never to have felt, the Government
h paying him $320,000 a year for his disgrace.
In making its wholesale appointments Saturday
night the Health Board overlooked an opportunity.
It forgot to appoint an inspector of the general fund

PRESSURE ON DEWEY.
THE movement to make Dewey a candidate for
the Presidency may die out, or it may assume
formidable proportions. It is in line with the
habit and practice of our people, who at the close of
b of our wars have sought to express their feeling
for the leading figure of each by an offer of the Presi
â¢ dency. This began with Washington. It was con
; tinned with Jackson. He was the most conspicuous
| personality in the war of 1812. After we had met a
I series of defeats on land he saved our national pride
j by the victory at New Orleans, and the fact that the
. battle was fought after peace was declared did not
'â  affect his position. The keen political insight of Mr.
I Clay at once saw in Jackson a coining President, and
Ihe ceaselessly antagonized a candidacy that was in
evitable. He joined with Adams, in the election by
I the House in 1824, to defeat Jackson in that agree
-1 ment which Randolph characterized as "an alliance
; between an Eastern Puritan and a Western blackleg."
' It must be said for Jackson, however, that he had at
; tamed eminence in civil life. He was a lawyer of
repute, had served creditably as Justice of the Supreme
Court of his State and had legislative experience in
; Congress.
At the close of the Mexican War the Whigs took
advantage of the latest hero worship in the nomina
tion of Taylor. That party Viad opposed the war, and
Mr. Lincoln himself, as a member of Congress from
Illinois, bad gone to great lengths in antagonism.
But the Whig politicians saw a chance to get a statute
of obli party victory at the same time, and
won with Taylor, who was not known to have ever
subscribed to a single principle of Whiggery. It at
tempted to work the same sentiment in 1852 by the
nomination of Scott, but lost. It is true that Pierce
was an officer in the Mexican War. but was undis
tinguished, and his military record did him no good.
In that campaign the part of Scott in the war was
fought over again. The campaign ballads were war
But the smoldering embers of war enthusiasm
could not be made to blaze, and Scott fell, and the
Whig party fell with him, never making another fight.
History was repeated at the close of the Civil War.
Grant, of unknown politics and undistinguished in
civil life, had made such a glorious history for his
country in war that he was a prize for the politicians.
Yet with him the idea was of slow growth. There is
no evidence that it originated with him or that he had
the slightest ambition for the office. But it came to
him, and his career in it did not add to the greatness
of his fame. His countrymen remember him most
fondly as the organizer and winner of victories in
battle.
Hayes, Garfield and McKinley were all officers in
the Civil War, but it cannot be said that their mili
tary experience as volunteers and not as regularly
trained soldiers was a commanding reason for their
election. It was merely a creditable incident in their
careers, but, standing alone, would have been insuffi
cient to promote them.
Now we have ended successfully the first foreign
war of the republic in which we were the invaders,
and it is not unnatural that the old habit asserts it
self.
There are existing political conditions which make
Dewey's candidacy seem an overmastering necessity
to a large number of politicians. It has been a ques
tion in the minds of thoughtful Democrats whether
that party is to survive. It is known that Mr. Tilden
made a grewsome prophecy that it would rally and
elect one man to the Presidency and then pass out of
existence. Its effort to make Dewey a candidate is a
struggle against fate, and repeats the Whig ex
perience with Taylor in 1848. The candidacy of
Dewey is the only possible way in which it can throw-
Bryan and cleanse itself of the eczema with which he
has infected it as principles. Therefore from thÂ»
South and from New York comes the demand for
Dewey, and the movement will present a very inter
esting study for the next eight months. The move
ment now has the features of an attempt to stampede
not only the party but the country. That it is causing
anxiety is evident in the interview of Senator Hannn.
Dewey himself has taken some pains to state his dis
qualifications for the Presidency, and has treated the
proposition only half seriously. This has seemed to
increase the movement.
Viewed from the politician's standpoint, the Ad
miral's immediate future offers the most alluring pos
sibilities for promoting hi 3 candidacy. The unequaled
effusion of feeling in New York is not to be the last
of patriotic demonstration. A little later he is to go
to Philadelphia and Chicago, and the furor will be
prolonged.
At present the question is the most interesting one
in our politics.
The scandal connected with the attempted sale of
a notaryship would suggest that the Governor might
judiciously establish an exchange for the auction of
positions at his disposal. It seems to be a rather un
dignified proceeding, to say the least, to hawk the
places through the byways by political tricksters.
A GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN.
WIDE as are the differences in the political situ
ations of the various States where campaigns
are in progress this fall, there is one feature
common to all, and that is the lack of a definite issue
upon which the Democratic party can ask the sup
port of the people. In every State, from Massachu
setts to Nebraska, the fight of the Bryanites is scat
tering and ineffective. It is like a guerrilla warfare
or a futile skirmish along a far extended line with no
direct assault anywhere.
From the Democratic campaign orators there has
been some denunciation of the gold standard, of the
tariiT, of trusts, and of the general policy of the ad
ministration, but it seems that upon none of these
issues have they succeeded in rousing any energy
among their followers, and accordingly they run back
and forth from one to the other trying to find some
thing which even if it be not an issue will at least
form a campaign cry and serve to excite the masses.
The trust question appears to be the favorite with
the campaigners in several of the States, and yet even
upon that issue there is lack of coherence and force
in the attack. In lowa the Democratic candidate for
Governor has endeavored to combine an old issue
with a new one by attacking the tariff and de
nouncing it as the parent of trusts. Bryan in a re
cent speech tried to fasten the silver question to the
new themÂ« by declaring the gold standard to be the
cause of trusts, and in Ohio McLean is attributing
the existence of trusts to the general depravity of the
Republican party. Thus in one State Democracy
fromises to abolish trusts by the adoption of free
trade, in another by the remonetization of silver, and
in a third by the mere act of getting possession of the
offices.
Such a condition of affairs in the counsels of the
party is not conducive to clearness of thought among
the leaders of the council, and accordingly it is not
surprising to learn that when George Fred Williams
of Massachusetts was asked by a Boston reporter
what measures he would take to curb the evils of the
trust system he replied that 'lie believed that if
Till: SAN FRAK CISCO CAlili, TUESDAY. OCTOBER 3. 1899.
Bryan we re elected and surrounded by men deter
mined to enforce the law much good would result,
and that this would tend in time to bring about an
effective remedy."
In fact, it appears the Democrats have taken up the
trust question not because they have a definite policy
to propose with regard to it. but solely because they
have no other issue at all upon which to make even
a pretense of a campaign. The country is too pros
perous to enable them to rally the masses by any of
the old calamity cries, and the free silver issue will no
longer serve to win votes. Therefore the trust issue
is brought to the front, and therefore the cry is that
the way to remedy the evil is to elect Bryan and trust
to Democracy.
The Board of Education has decided to equip a
number of the school buildings of the city with fiie
escapes. What a pity it has no power to put them in
the City Hall. Director Gedge might then have a
chance to escape the Grand Jury.
ORDINARILY after such a week as that which
witnessed the triumphant welcome accorded to
Admiral Dewey there would be in New York
a week of reaction and comparative repose, but it will
not be so on this occasion. Thousands of the visit
ors who thronged the city to attend the reception will
remain to witness the yacht races, and the fleets of
excursion steamers, yachts and other pleasure craft
that come and go to and from the course will 'n
themselves form a marine display fully as picturesque
and hardly less imposing than the grand naval pageant
that celebrated the return of the hero.
By the trials to which the competing yachts have
been subjected it has been made abundantly evident
they are the fleetest craft of their kind ever con
structed. Never before have sails carried boats capable
of ocean voyaging so lightly or so swiftly over the
seas. They represent the constructive skill and the
seamanship of the two nations whose sailors and
whose ship-builders are the foremost in the world.
The contest, therefore, is something more than a
sport for men of wealth and leisure. It is another
test of the comparative excellence of the Ameriacn
and the Briton, and as such will be watched with in
terest by thousands to whom yachting is a thing un
familiar and racing ordinarily uninteresting.
The race, moreover, is to be marked by another
feature of worldwide interest. It is to afford an
opportunity for a thorough test of the efficacy of
wireless telegraphy in reporting events as they hap
pen. It is true similar tests have been made before,
and only a short time ago The Call achieved a
notable triumph in journalism by arranging to re
ceive by wireless telegraph the earliest report of the
arrival of the transport with the California troops
from Manila, but nothing yet accomplished in that
way will equal what is to be done to-day by The
Call and the New York Herald in receiving by the
new telegraphy dispatches of the various features of
the race while it is yet in progress and the yachts
are fleeting over the sea.
From the tests which have been made under the
personal direction of Signor Marconi it appears the
I arrangements made for the wireless telegraph service
are such as to assure a successful working of the
system when put into operation this morning. It i^
from The Call, therefore, the people of San Francisco
will get the earliest reports of the course of the
race, and ample preparations have been made here for
bulletining them at once and aJso for showing with
miniature yachts the counterfeit presentment of the
race as it occurs.
As for the race itself everything promises well. Sir
Thomas Lipton has won the favor of the American
people by showing himself to be a frank, true-hearted
sportsman in the best sense of the word, and the race
will be one of friendly rivalry free from any trace of
national or personal antagonisms. The course will
be kept clear from the interference of excursion steam
ers and other craft by a small fleet of revenue cutters
under command of Captain Evans of the navy. Un
less, therefore, some storm prevent, the first match
of the two great yachts will take place to-day under
good auspices, and persons in San Francisco who
watch The Call bulletins will be able to follow it
almost as closely as those who actually witness it from
the deck of an excursion steamer.
An astronomer at Nice, Ita'.y, announces the dis
covery of a new comet. It is approaching the earth
at a great rate, and it will not be surprising to hear
within a day or so of some New York yellow news
paper hoisting the name of the celestial wanderer at
the head of its editorial column as a Presidential can
didate â not only hoisting, but nailing.
FOR YOUNG AND FOR OLD.
BY the arrangements made for a series of articles
designed for continuous home studies The Call
will furnish every day papers of instructive value
las well as of interest to the family. The studies are
i designed for the young as well as for the old. While
the series upon the works of Shakespeare will attract
the more thoughtful students of the higher branches
of literature, the desk studies for girls and the shop
and trade studies for boys will meet the need of
young people who wish to acquire information that
will be of practical value to them in the affairs of life.
The education of the mind begins with infancy,
and so long as the brain retains activity the educating
process never ceases. It is for each man and woman
to determine in what directions education shall go
forward. The press furnishes information of all kinds
on matters of current interest, the evil with the good.
the trifling events of life with those of the gravest
importance, but hitherto it has not seriously set about
providing for its readers courses of study having a
definite purpose in the direction of education. That
which has been lacking in the past is now to be made
up so far as The Call is concerned by the reading
courses which have been prepared under the direction
and supervision of Professor Seymour Eaton, for
merly of the Drexel Institute of Philadelphia, and one
of the foremost educators in the United States.
The studies selected are sufficiently varied to please
the most diverse tastes and interests. For one class
of students the articles on the grent artists of the
world will be most gratifying, while .mother will fol
low with most attention those upon American states
men, or those which deal with domestic economy and
household science. Each series, however, will have
something at least of attraction for all. Boys can
profit much by following the articles designed as desk
studies for girls, while many a girl who may have to
seek employment will find it to her advantage to study
carefully the instruction to be given in the shop and
trade studies prepared for boys.
The papers are, in fact, for the whole family. They
will be profusely illustrated and will supply pleasant
reading even to those who do not wish to take them
up as serious studies. To all persons engaged in
educational work they will be of exceptional value,
inasmuch as every article is to be the work of a man
or a woman who has had a large experience in educa
tion in one form or another.
THE YACHT RACES.
FIRST CHURCH FLAG
RAISED IN UNITED 'STATES
THE church flag unfurled by Bishop Coleman of the diocese of Delaware is
attracting much attention. It floats from a sixty-foot pole at the Bishop's
residence, Blshopstead, Fourteenth and Orange streets, and was designed
by the Bishop and two heraldry experts.
Its technical description is as follows: "Barry of thirteen gules and ar
gent on an inescutcheon argent of seven-thirteenths a cross patonce purpure."
This means that It has thirteen bars of red and white bunting alternately, with a
center field of white, seven bars wide, in which field is an Episcopal cross in pur
ple. The cross Is similar in design to the Bishop's pectoral cross. Purple Is tho
Episcopal color. The flag is nine feet six Inches square, the square form being
the more ancient and the more heraldic.
Not only is It the only church flag in the United States, but !t Is also, so far
as known, the only distinctive church flag in the world. The English Church flies
a flag, it Is true, but that is the Union Jack. Bishop Coleman will fly his flag on
every church day, which will make an average of about once a week.
PRESS COMMENTS
Rewards of Mrs. Hearst's Enterprise.
Oakland Tribune.
California is getting a lot of the finest
kind of advertising as a result of Mrs.
Hearst's enterprise in bringing about the
architectural competition for the univer
sity plans. Hero is a sample from the
Chicago Inter-Ocean: "It is plain that in
the future California will have something
to boast of. If we- hope to keep pace
with our sister State of the Pacific Slope
we must expedite the subway and
stadium schemes."
Success of the State Fair.
Ijlvermorp Herald.
The State Fair was brought to a close
last Saturday night after the most suc
cessful season In a decade. The State
Agricultural Society will be enabled to
reduce the heavy debt under which it has
been staggering for years by at least half
and the way has t>een paved for equally
successful fairs in the future. All kinds
of causes have been assigned for this un
precedented 6uccc-ss. The Citizens' Fair
Association, a body of representative
Sacramento business men, contributed a
great deal to the success. An active and
able board of directors with a broad
policy was likewise a strong factor. The
press also contributed its good offices.
But back of all these Influences was the
directing hand of the new secretary of the
society, P<uer J. Shields. Mr. Shields,
while retiring in disposition, has rare ex
ecutive ability and being In thorough
touch with all the interests represented at
the fair was able to direct all the depart
ments to the successful issue mentioned
above. Under his capable administration
the State Agricultural Society should
wax stronger and stronger until its in
fluence upon tbe agricultural and racing
interests of the State is as potent ns if It
was a quarter of a century ago when it
was a lusty infant and a power for good
in California.
Does He Risk His HonorP
BakprsfleM railfnrnlan.
Hon. Frank H. Short of Fresno, stanrh
: Republican, astute politician and spe'.l
-j binder of no mean order, is against ex
! pansion. He lately published an able
paper on the subject, and Is again in print
In a forceful article In The Call arraigning
, the policy of the administration with ref
: erence to the Philippines. Among other
things Mr. Short says:
"It is historically true that probably no
country or despotic ruler thereof ever* un
dertook to extend his jurisdiction over an
â  other country or people without asserting
i some claim of right and an additional de
sire to benefit not only his own country
I but the country and people subjected.
; Alexander is reputed to have rather terse
â¢ ly put it. 'If I have destroyed cities and
: countries. I have founded greater.' The.
: Caesars destroyed civil liberty in Rome as
it had previously existed, and thought
: they had more than recompens d
the Roman people by giving them an Im
perlal army and Imperial power and the
imperial city of marble, substituted fur
â  the old Roman town of wood. But in the
, light of subsequent history the change is
1 not reputed to have been to the advan
tage of the Roman people."
If the Fresnan Is not careful he will find
; a wide chasm between himself and the
grand old party. Mr. Short, by reason of
fitness, ability and location, Is the logical

Clip the Express Companies' Claws.
Chicago Journal.
"When Congress levied an internal rev
enue tax on parcels carried by express the
r-xprrss companies made the people pay
it. They "shifted the tax." They didn't
care where the burden fell, just so it
didn't fall on them. Now they are grum
bling nt the Government for instituting
an international parcels post with Ger
many for parcels up to eleven pounds in
weight. They want to carry thoae pack
ages themselves at their own prices and
compel the sender to pay for the revenue
stamp on the receipt besides.
There is no cure for this kind of greed.
There if" no way to make these corpora
tifuis either generous or patriotic or fair.
The rvnly thing to be done with them Is to
adopt measures that will protect the peo
].;. from their rapacity, and one way to
5o that is for the Government gradually
to extend the activity of the Postal De"
partm^nt until It covers part or all of the
express business.
In quarreling with the German parcels
post treaty the express companies have
drawn attention anew to our own back
ward position in the matter of a parcels
post. No parcels weighing more than four
pounds can now be sent through the mails
between points in this country. Yet if it
is practicable to carry a four-pound par
cel it is perfectly practicable to carry a
larger one, and it ia as practicable to
carry an eleven-pound package between
American points as between an American
and a German point. The eleven-pound
limit would embrace the great bulk of the
Christmas and New Year express busi
ness, and the express charges at that time
of the year are no inconsiderable item of
the holiday shopping expenses.
The people ought to be able to emanci
pate themselves from the tyranny of the
express monopoly, and they can do it if
they will demand of their representatives
when Congress meets, that the benefits*'
the Government gives foreigners through
the international parcels post be extended
to Americans as well. There is no sense
In denying to ourselves what we have
given to others, and there is just ns little
sense in allowing the greedy express com
nanies to monopolize the parcels-carrying <
business as there would be in allowing
them to monopolize the carrying of let
turn.

DREYFTS' JUDGES-W. 8., City. The |
list of the Dreyfus Judges as published ;
In The Call was correct. The fact that
the yellow journal published a list that
varies from that of The Call is no proof
of Its correctness. Whenever you see
anything in The Call you may rest as
mired of its correctness.
BUNCOMBEâ E., City. The origrin of
"buncombe," as applied to effusive rhe
toric irrelevant to the business at hand. I

speaking for you, but for Buncombe."
"STARVING TIME"â E.. City. In 1609,
after the departure of Captain John

like to save themselves from starvation.
That was known as "the starving time."
A PRETTY NAMEâ Mystic M., City, j
What would be "an odd and pretty name ]

THE FLAG IN 1900â O. S.. Soldiers'
Home, Los Angeles County, Cal. This
department has not been able to find In
the records that "Senator John Sherman
introduced a law for the placing of the
stars in the blue field on the American
flag, to take effect in 1900." The placing
of the stars w.is iixnd upon the admission
of the State of Utah in 1894 in alternate
rows of eight and seven.
WOMEN AS CLERKSâ M. E. 8., Col
ma, Cal. Women who are employed as
clerks or saleswomen in dry goods or
cloak stores in San Francisco are paid
from $6 to JS a weeK. Generally tlv hours
are from 7 a. m. to 6 p. m. The wages of
skilled sewers and dressmakers depend
upon the class of work upon which they
are engaged, dressmakers who go out
by the aay charge from $1 DO up.
SOUPâ E. F. M.. City. "Do you eat
soup or do you drink it? " asks this corre
spondent. That is one of the mooted
questions. Writers on etiquette hold
one eats soup, for they all agree thai
should "n^ver eat soup out of the end of :
the spoon, but always from the Bidfl "
Now, consomme is a soup. If that is
served in an ordinary soup plate and par
taken of a spoonful at a time, that would
be considered eating soup, but if the same
consomme was served in cups, the one
taking it the same as coffee or tea would
be looked upon as drinking soup. There :
are a number Of soups, such as family
julienne, bouillabaisse .which no one could
drink, but would have to eat; conse- ;
quently whether one eats soup or drinks
soup depends upon the character of the ;
soup and the manner in which it is served.
ADMIRALâ S. 8., City. The grade of
admiral in the United States navy (as j
distinguished from vice admiral and rear
admiral) was first established by act of i
congress on July 25, 1866, and under that I
act ihrue admirals have been created, i
The first of these was David Glasgow

"Too mi:ch wind thpre." !s the verdict.
There wore all the elements of a strike
at the alleged new racetrack in South
San Francisco yesterday. The men em
pioyed on the new buildings up to Sun
day received $3 per day and were satis
factory but not sufficient in number. On
Sunday and Monday tho racetrack man
agement advertised for more men, as fol
lows:
V ANTsl>â Carpenters at the new racetrack.
South r*an Franclsoo; taUe Southern Pacific
â¢ cars to .-a:. Bruno or electric can to Bade-n;
.wages J3 &0 per day.
A number of men went down to th.> .
new track, determined to endure the ey-
Clones' known to ba perennial there for 'â 
the sake of the wages offered. They were |
informed that $3 was the utmost that i
eouid.be paid under the circumstances and ,
some of them went to work. The old
Tore* of about twenty-flvo to thirty men !
were paid oft, and so th- matter rests.
â¢ It seems that two champions of the j
old foree â "W. Harman and George Chisel ;
âthe former a member of Carpenters' j
Union No. 22. when they saw the adver- .
tisement for more hands In the papers. !
asked Superintendent Allen for equal i
wagesâ i. c.. i. : . 50 (as advertised) in place!
of the $3 they receive The demand was !
repulsed, but afterward Allen secretly of- i
fered Harman and Chisel the raise asked !
on condition that they remained with the
Job. They indignantly refused the offer J
â unless their fellow workmen were ad- !
mitted to the same justice. As the total !
number of men, together with those re- !
cently obtained, would be In excess of the j
number which the funds of the manage- I
ment could employ, the men were paid j
off as stated.
As a matter of fact, the men who quit
are not. sorry to go. The tales they tell
cf the region of the new track are heart
rending.
They say that the accommodations for
men at the new racetrack are not tit for
the decent workineman. They tell of
hands being housed from six to twelve
d"Op in one single room; of th* close cor
poration or combination between the
management of the work and the hotel
keeper whereby the hot^l-keeper is on
hand on pay night the pay office to
prab every cent his books shew against
the unfortunate carpenter. They tell of
the ease with which "checks" for drinks,
tobacco., etc.. may be obtained at the ho
tel, only to be deducted from the payroll,
and of. other inconveniences ana sharp
practices perpetrated on the men so fool
iiardy as to brave the new racetrack
"work.
'.For' there is a. perpetual cyclone there
they =ay. â¢ ThÂ« men who have labored on
the new buildings are assured that the
public will never stand what the track
itself cannot stay with. For some time
thÂ»- rnanagrment has been attempting to
â¢'put. down loam on the track, but the
wind will not lot !t stay, and the steam
Toller is said to have given up the job
of crushing the loam down, regarding the
project as a hollow mockery.
The wind blows, and blows, and blows.
The track is bound to be a slow one if
it ever becomes a track, and the people
who go to the r;ices do not as a rule care
to ' sfii In a windstorm forever. If the
workmen who are pnid to be there do
rot r<4i?h tha scene what will bo thought
of it by those why may b*> asked to pa
troniio the new track for motives (pure
sport -and pleasure?

BROAD GAUGE BUSINESS MEN.
I An Association That Is Not Afraid
to Demand Its Rights.
At a meeting of the Mission Business
i Men's Association last night there was
i but very little time lost in preliminaries, j
i In the absence of the president. V4ce-Pres- !
. idem Eugene McCoy occupied the chair, j
' and Secretary E. S. Harrison read the call j
! which had been issued to the directors for |
\ the meeting after which it was stated j
i that it was about time for the Mission ;
; people to make a concerted movement to '
! secure for themselves a portion of the !
! public funds for Improvements. To ac- |
! complish this end the following resclu- \
j tior.s were read by the secretary and
| adopted without a dissenting voice:
Whereasâ An issue of bonds is contem- j
plated for the pun of beautifying thÂ»
city by extenilng the Park Panhandle to
Van Ness avenue and Market street, and
Wnerea?â This Improvement -Rill be whol
ly for the btr.eflt cf the Western Addition, |
a;:J
Whereasâ Mission has been and '.9 a
neglected district of San Francisco, devoid
cf parks and boulevards and with but few
smoothly paved streets: therefore, be it
Resolvedâ thÂ« Mission Business Men's
Association that a demand be made upon
the Board of Supervisors by the people of
the Mission that a. commission be appointed
to appraise the Jewish Cemetery lots and
that such other Bteps.be taken as to insure
that a provision for this purchase will be
incorporated in the contemplated bonl .-
-; â¢ cue. -We. demand, also, that Dolores ... I
be converted Into a boulevard connecting !
the proposed park at the Jewish Cemetery
lots with the proposed Park Panhandle,
thereby establishing a connection between
Golden Gate Park and the proposed Mission
park. We have petitioned In the past for
Mission Improvement: we have entreated
and been refused. We will no longer
amicably request that these things be done
which should have been done without the
asking, but demand them and give public
notice and warnin* that all efforts to im
prove and beautify the city without giving |
the Mission Just recognition and Its share
of money for public Improvements will be
thwarted by our people. Our , regressive
people favor the Park Panhandle extension,
but It will not get their support unless ade
quate provision for the district in which are
their homes ar.d their property la made.
Be it further
Resolvedâ That this association demands
the repavement of Valencia, Mission and
Sixteenth streets from Guerrero to Folaora.
We want to see the business streets of the
city put ir. the best possible shape. We
do "not want to see our city like Chicago â '
with the finest boulevards and vilest streets
of any city In the United States We be
lieve that smooth, well-paved streets have i
a commercial value far in excess of the !
cost of construction, and think that a. plan j
to beautify the city without improving the i
condition of the principal business streets i
would be like ' Hamlet" without thÂ«Â» Prince
of Denmark. Therefore we earnestly urge, in
view of the uncertain quantity that a dol- I
lar-limit tax levy will provide for -ma
nent street Improvement, that provision be
made in the contemplated bond Issue for
the improvement of the principal business
streets of the city. Including those desig- j
nated in these resolutions.
A committee on conversion of the Jewish :
Cemetery lots into a park .and making:
Dolores street a boulevard to connect with j
Golden Gate Park Panhandle was appoint- :
ed by the chair. It consists of the follow
ing well-known progressive minded Mis
sion residents: Judge F. "W. Van Reyne- j
gom (chairman). Daniel Kelly, A. R. Gun
nison, George Walcom, D. A. Hulse. i
Louis J. Goldman, B. S. Harrison, Eugene

BROWN ACCUSED
OF DERRY'S MURDER
Evidence of a Damag
ing Nature.
: atch to The Call.
XOGALES, Ariz.. Oct. The officials
of Santa Cruz and Pima counties are forg
ing a chain of evidence about J. Clarence
Brown that will result in his examination
on the charge of murdering E. W. Derry
of San Francisco.
District Attorney Cooper of Pima Coun
ty has discovered that Brown and Derry
were together in Bisbee; that they left
there together early in Juno In a light
wagon drawn by two horses. They had
a tent, cooking stove and camp outfit.
Since then nothing has been seen of cither
Derry or the outfit, and no news of him
can be secured. His description has been
secured from Bad Francisco, and It tal
lies closely with the man found hanging
in the ilimslest sort of a manner to a limb
of a tree in the Pajarrtto Mountains.
Sheriff Wakeneld of Pima County is now
working on the case, and says be la posi
tive Derry has been murdered. Brown Is
now in jail in Tucson charged with forg-
Ing Derry's name. When arrested he had
a mass of deeds, mortgages and checks
belonging to Derry. In his baggage was
also found a vial of corrosive sub.'mate
tablets, one of which had been broken In
two and one of the parts was missing
Sheriff Wakefield believes Derry Wai poi
soned.
Brown wrote the Eank of California in
Derry'a n.inif- to forward â¢ . book
V This town. The check book Is here, ad
dressed aa rf-qu^st-d. and a'so a letter
written by Brown from Crittenden, dated
September 6, requesting the postmaster to
forward mail to Tucson. Brown's record
nsactlons in Crittendon Is not yet
known. He refuse to give any history of
himself, and he is yet unidentified.
BIG DAY ON NEW YORK
COTTON EXCHANGE
NEW YORK. Oct. 2.â Tt was a big day
on the Cotton Exoharge. The greatest ad
vance in price? was a matter of thirty
eight points, and from the start to the fin
i.=h the bull faction was in c nfrol. Fri
day's queer doings in the New Orleans
markot had led the trade here to look for
something in the way of a surprise when
the market opened, more particularly as
it had been rumored that Liverpool shorts'
werÂ» in full retreat and being closely fol
i iwed by jubilant bulls-. The Initial sales
J an advan<-? far exceeding the
hopes of th-? most optimistic holders, while
subsequently business revealed an inten
sity of bullish sentiment in outside circles
not even imagined by the market's beat
friends.
The stroke of the gavel started a wild
wave of speculative activity, which
showed little abatement up to the very
close. Opening prices were fifteen to
twenty-five po.nts above the closing of
Thursday, and the market closed firm :it
a net gain of thirty-one to thirty-four
points.

LEADERS IN SAN FRANCISCO
EXCITEMENT IN CHINATOWN
OVER PLACARDS.
â¢
Kang Yu Wei, One of the Late Em

to Replace Kwang Hsu
Upon the Throne.
Chinatown was feverish with excitement
yesterday over several portentous pla
cards which ha'! been ; isted coi

by i . . .. â  sts belonging to
the party of the deposed Emperor, Kwang
1 1 su. The proclamation is neatly printed
iti black ink in Chinese characters and
. ea a sh< * i ; papei v. feet long
by two (eet wide, containing several thou
sand words.
All day long crowds of silent Chinese
stood in front of the placards, and very
few went away without reading the entire
matter. They made no comments, nor d:>l
they speak to one anotherâ a rare specta
cle in Chinatown. There si â¢â mcd to be a
heavy fear resting upon the readers lest
they might betray their approval of a
publication that bristled with treason
against the Dowager Empress of China.
The document Bigned by Kang \"u

. iarters in Victoria. K. â¢ '. When the
eror was dethroned by the Dowager
Empress Wei's four assijclatrs Were be
headed by her order, but he managed to
- in disguise from the empire.
Wei stuns out by tailing attention to
the present weak and deplorable condition
of i hina among the nations of the earth,
and ascribes her condition to the want of
progressive Ideas and of reforms that he
..r.d the Emperor were about to inaug
urate when the dethronement took place.
The Dowager Is of th< atlve class,
and deposed the Emperor because of his
reform Ideas. Wei i all? upon all bis
countrymen who have the love of their
nation and their race at heart to put
themselves, at once in communication with
him ..r his agents and to Join the revolu
tionary movement which he proposes to
inaugurate for the dethronement of the

DECISION
IS GIVEN TO
McCLELLAND
Referee John J. Quinn De
clares Soldier Smith
Committed a Foul.
Esecial Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBT'RG. Oct. 2.â Jack McClelland
got the decision over Soldier Smith to
night in the sixth round of a fight
scheduled for twenty rounds. When Ref
eree John J. Qutnn made the announce
ment that he gave the tight to McClelland
on a foul. It was greeted by mingled
hisses and cheers by the 1500 spectators.
Some called it a fake, but Quinn said
Smith hit Mac while in a clinch. Smith
claimed that he had broken his wrist in
the second round and one uf his sâ
eald the foul was made to finish the tight
ing. If Smith's wrist was really broken h*
did good work, for in the third round he.
floored Mci'ielland with hard punches on
the jaw. Tr> second time down Jack took
the full time limit before getting to his
feet. The contest was about nn even
thing up to the third round, which was
decidedly Smith's. In the fourth Mc-
Clelland had a shade the better of it arid
in the fifth he held his own. The fight
was stopped after thÂ»? sixth round had
commenced. The result every way was
a disappointment to the crowd.

ABANDONED BY
THE MAN SHE
FONDLY LOVED
Romantic Adventure
of a Girl.
LENA SPRAGUE'S MISTAKE
ENTICED FROM HER HOME IN
HEALDSBURG.
While Wandering Along the Water
Front She Was Found by the
Police and Restored to
Her Parents.
-r.a Sprague. the 14-year-old daughter ;
of John Sprague, a well-known resident of '
Healdsburg-, yesterday morning eloped j
with John Bechunni, a young man who
was formerly a resident of this city. As
j soon as the parents of the girl learned
that she had gone with Bechunni they lost '
no time in notifying Chief Lees to Inter
i cept the runaway couple. Yesterday after- j
noon Policeman Bailey saw a girl answer- â 
Ing the description of Miss Sprague wan
! dering aimlessly along Davis street, lie
approached her and inquired if she waa j
from Healdsburg. She at first denied her j
identity, but finally admitted that her J
; name was Miss Sprague and that she had j
left her home to elope with "thy man she
loved."
Bailey took her to police headquarters,
where she was closely questioned by Chief j
.Lees. She claimed that the met Bechunni j
a short time ago and fell "desperately in i
love' with him. lie promised to make j
her his wife, but fearing taut her parents j
would oppose their marriage she agreed !
to elope with him. After gathering her j
effects and placing them in a handsaichel, I I
which the anxious lover bad given her for !
the occasion, the misguided girl left her j
home and went to meet Bechunni who was ]
at the depot waiting for her. The fellow I
nod already purchased railroad tickets j
and together they boarded the train
bound ror thl.s city. They reached here
yesterday morning and went to a lodging
house somewhere on the water front.
Bechunni shortly afterward left his
promised bride on the pretext that he was
going to the City Hall to get a marriage
license. Miss Sprague waited several
hours and as Bechunni failed to return '
she became alarmed and went in search
of him. Just as she was about to give up 'â 
the quest she ran afoul of Officer Bailey, |
who finally recognized her from the de
scription sent to this city by her anxious ,
parents.
The girl had in her possession several
articles of female attire which she said
had been bought by Bechunni. While th*> '
police were questioning her to learn what !
had become of Bechunni the father of the ;
foolish girl visited the Central Police Sta
tion and excitedly inquired if any trace
had been found of his daughter. On catch- '
ing a glimpse oÂ£ her he at first proceeded
to severely catechise her, but finally !
promised to forgive her If she would re
turn home. The girl readily agreed and
together they left the station.
Early this morning Bechunni was found
in the Commercial â . tel. Officer Bailey
went to his room and forced an entrance.
As soon as the door was opened the Ital- I
ian placed his hand to his pocket and
attempted to draw a revolver. After a
struggle he was disarmed, handcuffed an I
taken to the Harbor oollee station. When
searched it was found that Bechunni had
in his possession a large, loaded revolver.
. nn i had It not been for the quick actfcn
of the officer in seizing him It is proba- j
ble that he would have used it. He was
charged with abduction.
GOLD FOUND ON
KOTZEBUE SOUND
TALLANT PABTY SAID TO HAVE
STRUCK IT RICH.
Took Out Twenty-Two Ounces of
Nuggets and Then Had to Re
turn to Cape Blossom for
Provisions.
After all the hard things that have been
said about the Kotzebue Sound country '
It is strange to hear a man speak well of j
It, more particularly a man who put in
nearly eighteen months up there. Gold
hunters who went there in the expecta
tion of finding nuggets in bushels came j
back saying that all the gold that could
be found was only "traces." Some of the !
prospectors died from scurvy, others per- I
ished In the snow and many succumbed \
to a disease called "black leg." No one i
who returned nad a good word to say for j
Kotzebue, and all were glad to get away :
from the countrj, save a few who went
further afleld and are said to have struck
It rich.
All who came away are going to stay
away save one. He is Captain li. A. Hig'- !
gins, and a threatened attack of "black
leg" drove him out. He says he is going
back in the spring by the first vessel that
sails. Captain Higgins is staying at the
Russ House. For six years he was
master of the yacht Gitana, and when the j
owner of the vessel laid her up and went '
traveling Captain Higgins followed his ex
ample and traveled to Kotzebue Sound.
When there seemed not the faintest
chance of striking pay dirt Captain Hig- !
gins went master of the river steamer
John Reilly that was running on the l
Kowak. "Last year the best we could do '
was to get about 300 miles up the river," :
said he yesterday. "The Kowak Is the I
hardest river in the world to navigate.
One day you will have six feet of water
in some places, and the next day th.-re
will not be as many Inches. The channel
changes about once an hour so you never
know what is going to happen.
"This year the river was on its good be
havior, so 1 managed to pet John D Tal
lant. the banker; Howard Palmer of
Oakland and ten others as fir up as the '
Kogoluktuk River. They had brought five i
small boats with them, and these they
took over to the Reed River. They went I
up the Reed River as far as Hot Springs,
and haif way between Hot Springs and
the headwaters of the Notoark River '
they struck i: rich. They got the nuggets '
under the tundra grass on the 15th of i
May last. They say they took out 22
ounces in a short time, but personally I '
only saw about 8 or 10 ounces.
"The party was not very well supplied
with provisions, so two of them were left
behind with nearly all the stores and the
others hurried back to the John Reilly. :'
I was waiting for them and hurried back !
to Cape Blossom, where Mr. Tallant pur
chased a year's supplies for his party and ;
they at once started up the river again, j
The men tried very hard to keep their
secret, but it leaked out and then the
crew of the steamer gave their friends a |
few pointers. As a result the Hayne
party of Santa Barbara and the J." B.
Brown party of San Francisco followed
the Tal'.ant party. At this time T should
say there are about seventy men on the
new diggings.
"The men who have come back from
Kotzebue Sound on the schooner t'harles
Hanson have told me to my face that they
didn't believe my story, but 1 saw the
gold and I know what I am talking about.
Th>- nuggets are a different color from
those found on the Yukon or at Cape
Nome. They have a greenish tinge, and
old miners say they come from an old
Sit and a large one. Black leg: scared
me away, but I'm going in again mxt
spring-. It is a disease something: like
Deri-Deri. The legs swell up and turn
black, the teeth loosÂ«=n and fall out while
you lose flesh rapidly. I once had an at
tack of beri-bpri. and I didn't want to
have black leg if 1 could escape it by run
ning away "
<"aptain Hi?Kln= Is going East on Thurs
day, and will r-nurn here early next year
to take ship for Kotzebue.
The large=t-plass bottle plant in the
world is located at Alton, 111.

TO PLAY POLO
IN THE PARK
Blues and Reds of Blingum
Arc Scheduled to Meet In
Exciting Combat.
"Drags." "traps," buggies and vehicles
of every description will be seen in Golden
Gate Park to-morrow afternoon, as the
brawny men from Blingum are going to
play polo. Society will grai â¢Â«.â¢ the game
With its presence, and it is expected that
n few thousand who are not in the exclu
sive pool will also be there, as the game
. tn all comers.
The game will be played on the recrea
tion' grounds, and is to commence prompt
ly at 3:30 o'clock. This will not be the
first time the exciting game has been
played in the people's pleasure grounds.
Last year two teams from the exclusive
San Mateo club contested for supremacy,
and those who were fortunate enough to
witness the playing: were rewarded with
enough excitement to last them a month.
The men played with vim and frightened
many of the spectators by their daring
races after the wooden sphere. This will
be repeated to-morrow. The winners will
receive the plaudits and smiles of the fair
for their exertions, and later be dined by
the losing team.
Walter Hobart, who has entirely recov
ered from his late Illness, will be In the
eaddle and captain the reds. lie will
have Charley Dunphy, the well-known
gentleman rider, K. J. Carolan and
Thomas Driscoil to assist him. Â»
Richard M. Tobin will look after the
destinies of the blues. He will be aided
by such well-known exports as Peter Mar
tin, Edwin Tobin and C. A. Baldwin to
help land a victory.
There will be enough ponies on the
grounds to make half a hundred boys
happy if they possessed them. These wiry
beasts have been trained to the minute
add seem to take as much interest In the
game as the men who are piloting them
in and out of scrimmages. Then there
will be scores of esquires to lend aid to
the knights who will wield the polo sticks,
aria they in turn will be accompanied by
'ostlers. Ftableboys and other 'orsemen.
Captain Thompson of the Golden Gate
Park police squad will be on hand with
his .silver-mounted saddle and his famous
Jumping horse and help keep the crowd
from stampeding the polo ponies.
Blingum will be out in force. The resi
dents of that exclusive country residence
j-ection Will be transported to the grounds
in four-in-hands and other stylish turn
outs.
â¢ The teams will leave the Palace Hotel
In four-in-hands, dressed for the fray.
Their Journey to the park will undoubt
edly attract attention, as the vehicles will
undoubtedly be decorated with appro
priate colors, and a lusty-lunged youth
will discourse on a coaching trumpet.
It Is .expected that 'â â¢'"Â« people will wit
ness the contest, which promises to be
extremely Interesting. A silver cup will
be awarded the victors.

contested race of the season was the bat
tle royal through the stretch between
Fortis and Alaria in the mile and a slx
:. event, the former winning by a
bead. Fortis was originally booked to
carry ninety-nine pounds, but a penalty
Incurred had been overlooked, and he
picked up 103 pounds. This necessitated
a Blight delay In the betting ring. With
but ninety-four pounds In the saddle Al
aria. made a winning bid for the long end
of the purse, but Mounce, her Jockey, who
b< i ms not to have yet learned the. short
way uruund the track, threw the race
away. He allowed Jack Ward on Fortis,
the favorite, to take all sorts of liberty
with him, and in a lons, hard drive was
led out a short head. It was the pret
tiest linish of the afternoon.
Sisquoc, the unruly son of Brutus, was
Installed a Blight favorite over Rixford
and Palapa for the opening scramble for
two-year-olds. He tried to run away with
Devln, and then after leading Into the
â  stretch was beaten with ease by Kixford.
! Hose of Hilo ran a close third.
There seemed to be no plausible reason
why Socialist, was not the best of the
seven starters In the Six-furlong sprint
that followed, and the St. Carlo horse
; was heavily played at short odds. Ruiz
; held him unaor restraint to the stretch,
; where he let out his wraps and outfooted
Manzanilla to the wire without effort.
Old lndra finished a close third.
Quite a delegation of the smart people
' had Sam Merriwether's Devereux as a
good thing in the second live-furlong .lash
for two-year-olds. The coin was laid
down in chunks on him in the ring-, and
. Ward spoiled It all. While trying to
squeeze through a knothole on the back
stretch the lightweight rider was cut off
! and hopelessly thrown out of the race.
1 Rachel C, the first choice, then disposed ;
comfortably of El Arte, a 25 to 1 out- :
i sider.
, J. Walsh again distinguished himself by I
j sitting still. In the mile selling run he
sat astride Cyril and made a "not foot"
for the wire. The ring at one time laid j
as good as 6 to l about the Ryan entry,
and in a hair-raising drive trie gelding !
I led Opponent, the favorite, out a head.
Dare 11 ran a surprisingly good race, hay
' ing his lieht snuffed out but a nose for
second place.
The concluding six-furlong spin -went
;to Midlove, the 1 to 2 choice. The fat
little filly made all the running, reaching j
the stand a length ahead of Bamboulia,
second choice in the betting. Mike Rice
! took the show from 1 Don't Know.

FOR OWNERS
AT OAKLAND
Ten Rich Stakes Offered by
the California Jockey Cub.
Changed Conditions.
Yesterday the California 'Jockey Club j
announced its list of. stakes to be com
peted for at the meeting: now in progress
at Oakland track. In the past a greater j
number of prizes have been offered, but
many of them, especially those offered
lor horses of the two-year-old brigade,
havo resulted in virtual walkovers,
arousing no interest whatever. This sea
son it is the intention of the association !
across the bay to give liberal overnight ;
handicaps and special events throughout
the season. None of the stakes to be
contested for are less than $1500 valuation,
being headed by the $10,000 Burns handi- !
cap. The Pacific Union handicap has been
increased from (1500 to $2000 and the name
of the Baldwin strike handicap has been |
changed to the. Lissak handicap in honor i
of Ivouls Lipsak, the popular and affable
manager of the track over the bay. The
Naglee selling- stake has also been in
creased and so has the Follansbee handi
cap. The attention of owners is called to
the conditions of the Oebbard handicap.
In all $35'J0 is hung up, but horsemen are |
asked to make payments on a stake of
but ?2000. It is a novel idea and a con
ceit of Handicapper Brooks. Twenty
eight thousand in all is offered, the en
tries for which close on November C.

tested for before January 1, 1900. The con

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A Free Trial Treatment Sent Privately by Mail to All Who
Suffer.
A Remarkable Remsdy for a Terrible Affliction â The Cure Is
Permanent,
A free trial treatment Is being sent out
by the State Medical Institute In order
to demonstrate the fact that the most
horrible of all diseases can be cured.
There is a good deal of controversy over
this subject among those who declare the
disease incurable, but the facts are in-
dubitable and must be acknowledged. The
action of this new remedy Is peculiar. The
physician in charge of the Institute has
had a long and varied experience treating
this uisease o* the blood, and about two
years ago, after a long series of experi-
ments, he found the exact specific that
offsets the poison, renders it lifeless and
eliminates it from the body. Having per-
sonally examined many hundreds of cases
and familiarized himself with every de-
tail of the disease, his discovery came
naturally and has never failed him. One
of his recent cures was a most hopeless
case, the disease having caused the hair
to fall out and the body was one mass of
putrescent sores, boils, blotches and un-
sightly disfigurements. In ten days tho
entire outer skin was healed and there

horse; weights to be announced three days
prior to the race, winners of other than a selling
purse after the weights are announced to carry
five pounds extra: one mile and a furlong.
$1500, the Gunst handicapâ A handler. for
two-year-olds and upward; entrance $10, $25
additional to start; the club to add an amount
necessary to make the gross value of the race
$1500, of which $200 to second and $100 to third
horse; weights to be announced three days prior

The free trial treatment has saved a

A radical cure without drugs for
weaknesses, the result of youthful In-
discretions, for lame back, varicocele,
I etc.
Dr. Sanden presents in his appliance
a scientific treatment. It performs no
miracles, but it will do what he has
demonstrated that drugs and medicines
cannot. It adds strength to the glands,
nerves and organs, while medicines
only stimulate. The Dr. Sanden Elec-
tric Belt with suspensory is simply the
proper application of the proper elec-
tric current.
You put the Dr. Sanden Electric Belt
I on when retiring for the night and take
jit off next morning. Seven to nine
hours of the gentle, strengthening cur-
rent a day for two or three months
does the work.
Dr.' Sanden publishes a little book
explaining all, which will be sent free
by mail in plain sealed envelope, or he
may be consulted free of charge at his
offices daily between the hours of 9 a.
m. and 6p. m., Sundays 11 to 1. He is
there to demonstrate to the patient's
satisfaction the results which can be
; attained by the use of his Dr. Sanden
j Electric Belt. Consultation free. Write
j or call to-day.

MUST WAIT UNTIL WEDNESDAY
BITTER COMPLAINTS AT THE
ENFORCED POVERTY.
Arrival of the Twenty-Eighth Regi
ment From Fort Meade â Sail
ing of Transports and
Clearing of Camps.
The Minnesota boys will be mustered
out of the service to-day, but they will
not be paid until to-morrow, a fact that
nearly caused a riot In the camp yester
day.
It has been the desire of the Governor
and the people of the State that the regi
ment arrive in Minneapolis in time to
meet the President when he reaches there
on October 13. For that reason an at
tempt was made to have the muster out
of the regiment delayed from October 3
to October 5, but in this the Minnesota
delegation was unsuccessful. The date
for the muster out was set for October 3.
and the men had no thought but that
they would be paid on the same day as
were other commands. There was great
excitement therefore when it was an
nounced yesterday morning that there
would be no money until Wednesday.
There was a howl of disappointment
and at once the men gathered around
Colonel Ames' tent and demanded the rea
sons for the delay. They declared they
had to meet their bills this evening, as
they hnd promised to do so in the ex
pectation of being paid promptly; and
they wanted money in their pockets on
the first night of their freedom, and they
believed they were entitled to it. Dele
gations from the different companies
made formal complaint to Colonel Ames,
but he could do nothing in the matter,
and beyond the fact that the delay In
the payment was by order of General
Bhafter. he had no idea what was the
> cause of it.
About the time the committees had
I come to a standstill matters were further
| complicated by the arrival of the Min
i neapolis Journal, in which was a state-
I ment io the effect that the payday had
! been delayed at the request of Governor
Lind, who wished the men to be paid
. only just before they left here for home.
The statement did not Improve the tem
i per of the men, and they were loud and
' bitter In their complaints. To soothe them
they were told the paymasters had too
much to do and could not pay them to
day anyway, but the paymasters depart
ment is always kept up to its work, and
the men can" be paid to-day and would
have been paid to-day if it had not been
for the oraer naming to-morrow as the
time.
The men declare they are not babies
, and they can take care of themselves
without the assistance of the State of
-1 fleers. They hint, too, that the idea is
to bring the men to such a state of mind
that they will break up the intended pa
rade in honor of the President. To-day
will be a lively one among the Minne
sotans.
The South Dakota men are scheduled
to leave the service on Thursday next,
October 3, but there are disquieting ru
mors io the effect that the regiment will
be held until all danger of smallpox has
d. At one time it was the intention
of the department to quarantine both the
South Dakota and the Minnesota regi
ments, but the intention was not carried
out. It is now being debated whether or
not to keep the command in the service
until the proper length of time for quar
antine has gone by, or turn the men loose,
with a possible danger of infection after
they have reached their homes. There
has" been no decision on the question so
far.
The Twenty-eighth Regiment has come
in from Camp Meade, Pa. It reached this
side of the bay at 11 o'clock and started
at once for the post. It came almost to
gether the last section being but a few
hours behind the first. The regiment was
recruited in Pennsylvania and the sur
rounding States, and it has in its ranks a
large percentage of men who have Been
service in the Spanish war. There is also
a liberal sprinkling of sailors, somo of
whom were with Dewey at Manila.
Colonel William E. Rlrkhimer, formerly
a' captain in the Third United States Ar
tillery Is the commanding officer of the
regiment but as he Is in Manila the regi
ment is in charge of Lieutenant Colonel R.
W Leonard. The command has put in a
good deal of time at the ranges, so is well
advanced in target practice.
The Twenty-ninth R>-giment is sched
uled to pall "next Thursday on the Para
and the Zealandlaâ the headquarters band
v. â ! companies on the Para and live
companies "n the Zealandia. The Valen
cia will sail the same day with a full

camp of outgoing volunteers and with

lesa otherwise ordered, the South Dakota
Regiment the Montana men will be the
:roops at the Presidio besides the
garrison a few recruits and the battalion
of the Fortieth and of the Forty-third,
which are struggling into existence.
Reports from the smallpox hospitals at
the Presidio and on Angel Island show no
â â¢â  in the situation. They bring the
information, however, that Corporal Lar

Regiment, is dangerously affected and
probably will not live.

Captain Hardin has been on duty as ad

the first rush toward the Philippines be
gan after the Filipino outbreak. He baa
had one of the most important as well as
one of the most difficult positions In the
service on this coast to fill, for he was
responsible for the instruction, the dis
cipline, the equipment and the general
straightening out of the raw material
that came, here from all over the country.
That they have made such good soldiers

the first of which a large number of candidates
appt ;ired before it and were interrogated as to
their qualifications under the provisions of the
new charter, and also a* to various other mat
ters touching their experience, etc.
After hearing the candidate! the committee
next went Into executive session and decided
to recommend to the caucus the names of the
following gentlemen from which tg select its
four nominees for the ofllco of Police Judges of
this city and county, namely:
W. G. Hritton. L. G. Carpenter, H. L.. Joach
imsen. James L. Xagle, E. M. Seaman, Wil
liam C. Tait.
Amors' the candidates who appeared before
the committee were Judge Thomas F. Graham
and Frank L.. Klngwell. The committee, alter
Investigation, finds that neither of the last two
named gentlemen puss-esses the qualifications
prescribed by the new charter for Police
Judges. Respectfully submitted.
GEORGE W. SCHKLti. Chairman.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
report Delegate Hoyne called attention to
the absence of Messrs. Brittain and Tate,
and said something scathing about it.
I^eon E. Prescoit was next recognized and
created all kinds of excitement by mov
ing that the report he laid on the table,
and Impolitically asserting that he did not
think the report was an honest one. This
was like placing a red rag before the com
mittee, and Edmond Tauszky clamored for
the chairman's attention, and on getting
it said he rose to a question of privilege.
In a voice of passion he said no man had
a right to say that the report was not a
fair and honest one. Ho yelled that he
was a member of that committee and no
one had a right to make such a state
ment. He concluded his heated remarks
by saying that it was discourteous to
place it on the table and hoped it would
be voted down.
I. J. Truman Jr.. another member of
the committee, arose and said it was
treating the committee unfairly by at
tacking it. He said that it Prescott was
an honorabb- man he would apologize for
his remarks, as they were unfair, unman
ly and unjust. He insinuated that he had
heard candidates eulogized to-night who
w.Te unworthy to receive the nomination.
People had mmc to him and told him
things he never knew until he was placed
on the committee. He said he did not
dare mention the names of the unworthy
candidates because they might be nomi
nated and elected and he might appear
before them some day and be at their
mercy.
Chairman Keliogg paid he was sure Mr.
Erescott would apologize, and that young
man in bis own defense said he bad no
Intention of casting a personal reflection
on the committee. He then went on to
give his reasons- for asking that the mat
ter be laid on the table. The motion to
lay it on the table was then put. but was
overwhelmingly lost. A motion for a re
cess of ten minutes was also lost.
Attorney Sargent moved that during the
vote each delegate stand up and call his
vote. This was also lost. W. 11. Hazel!
moved that the report be taken up for the
purpose of discussion. This motion met
with the raine fate.
Judge Bchell was called upon to make a
further report, he being chairman of the
committee on Police Judges. If- said he
was unprepared to make a report, as he
did not exoect any such opposition, as his
committee was appointed on the unani
mous vote of the caucus. He said he had
no objection to either Judge Graham or
Mr. Kingwell. He said he took it that the
Republican party intended indorsing the
new charter and for that very reason he
was willing to carry out Its provisions.
He believed the section prescribing that
candidates for Police Judge should have
practiced their profession five years up
to the time they were candidates for of
lice was constitutional. He then went on
to explain the reasons why he believed it
so and Delegate McMartin called the
chairman's attention to the fact that
Judge Schell was called upon for an ex
planation of the report and not an argu
ment. The. chair thought the delegates
needed all the light possible on the sub
ject and did not reprove the sppaker. L.
L. Solomons concurred in what Judge
Schell said.
Delegate Sargent asked that the nom
inations be reopened and this being
granted no placed William G. Brittain in
nomination. A vote was then taken and
183 votes were cast. Of this number Gra
ham received 106, Nagle UK. Carpenter
127, Joachimsen 124, Seamen 79, Britiaii.
47, Low 107.
Carpenter, Low, Nagle and Joachimsen
having received the highest votes were
declared the nominees of the caucus
The next order of business was the re
port of the committee on Supervisors
chairman Fields asked for more time and
told of the efforts the committee was
making to secure men who would carry
weight in the community and who would
be acceptable to the voters of this city
and county. He stated that the pros
pective candidate for Mayor on the Re
publican ticket had been invited by the
committee to aid it, and that he had been
with them the whole day giving advice
The caucus granted the committee
further time to report.
When the delegates ascertained that
the committee on Supervisors would not
be ready to report until Wednesday even-
Ing, it was decided to adjourn the caucus
until that time.
Wallace Bradford moved that the ques
tion of county committee selection be de
ferred until Wednesday evening. The
motion prevailed.
The subject may be introduced in the
convention tn-nij-'ht. In event of introduc
tion the caucus delegates will vote as a
unit against consideration. The chair
man, at the suggestion of Delegate Brad
ford, explained that such was the moan
ing of the motion to defer the selection
of the county committee until Wednesday
evening.
Delegates were advised that the con
vention would assemble at Odd Fellows'
Hall this evening at 8 o'clock. To-n!fjht
credentials will be required.
The caucus adjourned until Wednes
day evening.
The committee on Supervisors hold a
prolonged session yesterday. Horace Da
vip, whose nomination for Mayor will
probably be made by acclamation to
night, gave the committee the benefit of
his ludgmcnl.
Another session of the committee will
be held this afternoon. Republican lead
ers predict that an excellent ticket for Su
pervisors will be presented.

OF TRANSPORTS
No More Departures
Until Thursday.

ARRIVE IN PORT.
Gold From Nushagak River Brought
Down on the Indiana â One of
the lowa's Boats Cap-
Bizes in thÂ« Bay.
There Is a lull at the transport wharf
just now. The sailing of the Charles Nel
son and Glenogle last Sunday finished up
a great deal of work, but the rush will
be on again in a few days. The New
port, Pennsylvania and Tartar should ar
rive from Manila this week, while the
Valencia, Zealandia and City of Para are
scheduled to sail Thursday. About 6Uoo men
all told will arrive and depart. The Para
will take away a regiment and another
will go on the Zealandia and Valencia.
The Newport, Tartar and Pennsylvania
will bring home about two regiments be
tween them. The Pennsylvania with the
Washington boys left Yokohama on Sep
tember IS and should get here to-morrow
or Thursday. The Glenogle, which sailed
away Sunday, took away the material for
twenty-five miles of railroad. Down In
the Philippines Uncle Sam only controls
about thirty miles of the road out of Ma
nila. Another road Is to be constructed
Into the heart of the enemy's country,
and this will give General Otis two bases
of operation. It is the material for this
road that the Glonogle is carrying.
There is no change in the boilermak
crs' strike. The men still insist upon
eight hours' work and ten hours' pay on
the transports and the contractors will
not give more than ten hours' pay for
nine hours' work. The locked-out men
have held a number of meetings, but
nothing was decided upon except to hold
out to the bitter end.
The bay presents a very different ap
pearance just now to what It did a week
ago. At that time there were very few
grain ships in the bay; now there are a
round dozen of them. Since Saturday
afternoon there have arrived the Fair
port from Puget Sound, Arthur Fltger
trom Antwerp, Inversnald from Swansea,
Valkyrie from Cardiff, Sainte Anne from
Swansea, Province from Liverpool, Ra
hane from Newcastle. Eng., Invercauld
from Swansea, Pytbomtne from Ham
burg, Austrasia from Newcastle, Eng.,
Cambroune from Swansea and Silberhorn
from Antwerp. Chief Wharfinger Hen
derson and Assistant Chief Dryden have
b< en kept busy getting berths for the
fleet. Some of them are still unprovided
for and will have to remain in the stream
until there Is a vacancy at some of the
wharves.
The Silberhorn, which arrived yester- !
day, made a good run of 121 days from |
Antwerp. On July 27 William Sundstrom, |
an able seaman, died of consumption and
was buried ai si-a. The captain of the
Bilberhorn reports an uneventful voyage.
One of the lowa's boat crews got a duck
ing yesterday. All the boats were out for
Balling drill, and as one of them, contain
ing a cockswain and six men, attempted
to tack around the battleship the tide
carried the boat down under the lowa's
boom and she was overset. Some of the
men swam to the gangway and got
aboard, while the others were picked up j
by the launch. The boat was afterward
righted and hoisted aboard.
The ship Indiana arrived from the can- \
neries yesterday. She brought down a
very large cargo and over 500 fishermen
and Chinese. During the voyage three of |
the Chinese died. Two of them were 1
burled at sea, but the third was put in
pickle and brought to San Francisco.
Captain Verry of the Indiana says that
gold was discovered on the Nusha.tr ik '
River while he was up there. He brought
down a small quantity of gold and a few
nuggets that were washed out of the sand. â¢
X- \r spring he is going to the district to >
do some prospecting, as he thinks there !
is a good digging there waiting to be
i ipened up.
Fair's yacht Lucero is to be towed to
Antloch to-day. Her owner is up the river

MINISTERS MEET
IN WEEKLY SESSION
At the Congregational ministers' meet-
Ing yesterday morning Rev. Edgar H.
Libby of Chicago read a paper on
"Preaching of To-day and Preaching for
To-day." He made a plea for evangelical
preaching of the old Gospel. He said the
tendency of to-day was toward the beati
flcation of humanity and not the beatifica
tion of Jesus Christ. He was opposed to
this and desired that ministers should re
turn to the old methods.

INDICATIONS THAT IT .IS WORKING
AROUND TO A BETTER CONDITION.
The circular of Henry Clews says: "The po-
Bltlon of the market, in respect to certain ad
verre factors, shows a tendency toward Im
provement. The recovery of two ami a half
millions In the surplus reserves of the banks,
in spite of still free shipments of currency to
the interior and an excess' of $3,720,000 in re
ceipts over payments at the Sub^Treasury for
the week, is a hopeful symptom. It shows that
the banks have got the situation under control
and without any violence to their Wall-street
customers beyond a sharp discrimination
cgainst certain industrial collaterals. Also, the
tone of the London market is more settled,
though there is no abatement in the chances for
â¢war with the Boers; which is an indication that
the warlike contingencies have been already
largely discounted there, leaving bo much less
disturbance to arise on the actual outbreak of
hostilities. London, Paris and Berlin are keep-
Ing a sharp eye on thu maintenance of their
rtocks of gold and tnay be expected to do all
In their pawer to prevent shipments to this
country.. And yet our exports are so large thai
the foreign banks must calculate upon having
to ship the metal to New York in free volume
at no distant day. With a steady increase in
the supply of grain and cotton bills and the
current great ..disparity in 'money rates between
New York and London, it is not impossible
tbat a- few days may bring thq rate (or ster
. ling exchange to figures that will admit of our
Importing Bold. This need not necessarily be
'un occasion of alarm to London. Within the
last two years we have had abundant evidence
thut a large debtor balance to the United
â States- may be attended with an absence of im
ports of . gold to this coutry. It is not likely
tfiat our bunks would care to be flooded with
foreign supplies of the metal. Their chief im
mediate concern is to Bee the present stringency
.relieved through the strengthening of their ab
normally low reserves. As above shown, they
are already gaining control over that element in
their position: and, in view of the unusally
large stocks of money in the interior, it would
not be surprising ii the reflux of currency from
the West s>t In earlier than usualâ the more
to because the Western purchases of merchan
dise at the East have this season exceeded all
precedent. Under these circumstances, it is not
inconceivable that a moderate Importation of
â  goldâ say $15,000,000â might be regarded by the
metropolitan banks as better serving their ln
[â terests th.-in a lanjor volume. 'With the re
turn of. bay, {30,000,000 of currency from tii>?
Interior ami the receipt of J15.000.000 of gold
from Europe, the reserves would be restored
to a coiulli.on compatible with steady ease, and
their Interests would bo better served by ad
vancing against foreign exchange and permit
ting gold to remain among our Kuropean cus
tomcrF than by encouraging the shipment of the
metal hith?r and. forcing stringency abroad at
the cost of crippling purchases of our products
and forcing an unnatural r.-turn of our securi
ties. These factors suggest a probability thai
we 'are approaching the end of acute stringency
Jn the money market and show that the pro
. cess of recovery is likely to prove a steady and
euro one."

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 2.â The stock market had
to fncÂ» this morning an accumulated .depres
rlon of three days' trading on a sagging mar
ket In Ijomlon while the exchange was closed
here. The drop In prices at the opening was
h. wide one, numerous railroad stocks showing
a loss of a point or over and Tennessee Coal
showing an extreme decline of seven point.'-.
The locai traders were inclined to feel that
London was unduly depressed, especially with
reference to American securities, and they
6tarted to bid prices up again. The first loan
of the day was made, at 6 per cent and this
â¢nccuragcd an optimistic view of the jroney
outlook. The rally was short-lived and the
couise was quite consistently downward for
the rest oÂ£ he (.lay. A Eharp advance in the
coalers on the advance In the rest of the
anthracites was ineffectual to check the â !â â 
dlnes. London sold nut only during the first
hour, but as lung as ortlces there were open
fur business. Liquidation from that source
! reached between 40,000 ami Â£0,000 shurey. The
violent decline in British consols had an Im
portant sentimental effect, although it was
afterward explained that this was partly due
to the expectation of a new issue, Hut the
new issue is as significant of the practical
certainty of war as any Incident that has
thus far occurred, bo that the explanation did
not afford relief to the stock market depres
sion. The sharp rise In London discount rates
caused an advance of &j of a cent in the
actual rate for demand sterling here and had
an equally marked effect <in the sterling ex
change late both at Berlin and Paris. This
derelopment is equivalent to notice that I. m
don is not prepared to part with more gold
to New York without making every possible
effort to prevent It. Ixing sterling was weak
on selling against sterling loans. The local
money rate quickly moved upward when the
renewal of loans carried over from last Thurs
day bepan to influence the market. The call
'â¢â  ana rate was carried up t<i 17 per cent, while
the money market was still In lull activity.
It was then rushed up to 30 per cent, after
which there were violent fluctuations down
to 10 per cent and up again to 35 per nt, at
which rate the last loan of the day was made.
The closing was 30 bid and 33 asked. None
of the expected relief to the money market
was In slsht to-day. The developments in
London lessen the ability of further gold
Imports and the condition of New York ex
chinpe at Interior points Indicates a continu
ance of the demand for funds from that

Chicago Wheat Market.
â  CHICAGO, Oct. 2.â Wheat started strong at
\ an advance of %@%c for December and for
May, the latter option being In considerable
demand throughout the session. War in the
Transvaal was considered certain almost by
English traders, as was shown by a sharp
advance in the Liverpool market, and this
strongly Influenced the local traders.. Primary
receipts showed a big falling off and the for
eign demand for wheat was excellent. The de
mand was general at the opening, outside In
vestment buying being much in evidence and
December, opening at 73%@?4c, soon advanced
to 74'4c. This price was well above call fig
ures and selling against those privileges and
the usual realizing by longs caused a tempo
rary decline, December reacting to 74c. This,
however, was the only soft spot of the entire
session. Prices were soon back to <4>;@74%c.
and though the volume of trading fell off for a
time no further decline resulted. There was
apparently a quiet absorption of all offerings
by some Important Interests. Toward the close j
of the session the market again became very
active and broad and prices advanced ma
terially. A report that diplomatic relations be
tween England and the Transvaal had been
broken off and martial law proclaimed In Pre-
I toria put. a sudden stop to selling of any kind
and prices were bid up quickly. Considerable
interest was taken in the May option. There
was a good outside demand for this future and
the difference between May and' December
widened to 3c. In consequence. December ad
vanced to 74"i.c and closed at 71V.774"Â«c. May
ranged from 76%@77->ic and closed %@}ic higher
at 77% C. . â¢â  .
Corn was fairly active and steady. Exporters
were buyers of both December and May and
both futures scored material advances. De
cember closed %@%c higher at 30%@30 I ,Â£c. May
closed %c higher at 3Hic.
Oats, in common with the other grain mar
kets, were active and higher. December closed
Wâ¬->rc higher.
Provisions were only moderately active. At
the close January pork was 10c higher, January
lard Be higher and January ribs fie higher.

London Wool Sales.
LONDON, Oct. 2.â At the wool auction sales
to-day 1435 bales were offered. Business was
rather more spirited than on Saturday, due
principally to the better selection offered. De
spite this Improvement it was apparent that
the keen edge has worn off "the demand, and
the only stock in good request was a lot of
fine Geelong greasy. French and German act
ively absorbed medium greasy merinos. A large
Bupply of crossbreds was offered. Fine grades
were firm, but the coarser ones were Irregular
and were frequently withdrawn. There was a
considerable falling off in the demand from
American quarters, and consequently big prices
for medium greasy were not obtainable.

Comedian â Theatrical
Notes.
Tnlcfs jou have already made an en
gagement for "Much Ado" don't go.
It would be such a pity for you to gt>.
â¢whoÂ«ver you are. If you belong to the
other generation remember Modjeska of
the one time and be happy. If you be
long to this generation be good children
and believe what papa and mamma tell
you and bo likewise happy. You will be
â more "comfy" all round than if you go
to see "Much Ado" at the Columbia-
Alas and alackaday â the comedy is
turned tragedy. Save for John Kellerd,
bless his merry soul, who comes bravely
t.i the rescue. For Modjeska's Beatrice
is not mischievous; she Is not maddening:
and if her coquetry would turn the head
nt any man I know then by my faith I
know no man. But John I\.ellerd causes
h^3 own bead to be turned in the most
Dcing fashion. He was born for
comedy, whatever he may have tried to
make himself. His fun comes easy and
lb a chummy little way with the au
.'.:ence that It likes. Long life to his Ben
ar.d may the gods prevent bio ever
:-';irr:r.g. It is a blessed thing to know
that there Is a leading man left.
But the comedy is turned tragedy and
I can't forget It. I remember Modjeska's
Beatrice of ten years ago and I wonder
>io I sco aright? The solidity of this, the
higher-education-of-woman tone of It! It
Is thesis-:ike as Shakespeare never meant
it to be. l'il wager before we ask him.
Modjeska. Is Magda â yea; she is Marie
Antoinette, perhaps; above all, she Is
Mary Stuart. It is a sorry thing to see all
that is (rand in those driven away by
.'â¢rriment.
There :s a warm corner in my heart for
Frederick Mosley, who cheerfully made
lit heard above the entrance of tae
audience. He was the only one who sue
d in doing so during the first act.
â¢ me entreat you not to go.
Try "Macbeth," try "Mary Stuart." but
â¢i a "Much Ado." Whether it prove dull
or pathetic is according to you, but you
won't like it. C.
TivolL
"The Mikado" is one of those few comic
operas that never grow old. No matter
how often you listen to them, you are al
ways delighted with the bright and melo
dious strains that run through them. It
â is needless to discuss the merits of the
work itself, bo we have to restrict our
eelves to the individual efforts. Before
all attention should he given to Alf
"Whet-lan, the new comedian who made his
â initial bow this season as Ko Ko. That
Mr. Wheelan is a comedian of experience
may be gathered at the first glance. He
knows his position perfectly well, never
Takes advantage of great applause, but
refrains from doubling up his numerous
successes. He has some very original and
effective ideas and does not force himself
upon his audience. He awaits his chances,
u-ses them to the best of his ability and
then retires to give somebody else an op
portunity. His face is very expressive.
Toward the end Mr. Wheelan began to
introduce just a little too much business
.and it would do no harm to tone down a
little. I also would omit the Hebrew
prayer in the second act; it is not always
' wise to â  ke a religious motive as a pre
text for fun making. There cannot be any
doubt that Mr. Wheelan will be very pop
ular if he has not ready gained popular
ity.
â¢ Another comparatively newcomer who
was very enthusiastically applauded was
Miss Julie Cotte. whost Pitti-Sing was a
charming creature. Miss Cotte plays her
part with much taste and sings daintily.
Although not possessing a very powerful
voice, she understands so well how to use
.it that it hpconipp a true enjoyment to
listen to her. Thomas Green has now
finally established himself in the good
graces of the Tlvoli audiences. His agree
able and clear tenor voice came much in
.evidf>ncf> during his able portrayal of
Nankl-Poo; and his splendid stage Dres
â rnee enhanced the tout-ensemble of his
impersonation. William Schuster, through
his successful representation of Poo-Ran,
proved once more his fitness a.s a vocalist
and an actor. But who would ever have
thoutrht that Louis Newbauer. the dapper
little flutist of the Tivoll orchestra, was a
comedian! Nevertheless, this Is a fact
for his interpolated flute solos contributed
largely toward the humorous aspect of
orA of the scenes.
Two drawback? of the performance were

since the old familiar opera was rendered

Innovations which do not detract but
rather strengthen, the original. There is
a dance by eight young girls in wooden

been added. The choruses are excellent,

The farce comedy "Innocent as a Lamb"
drew a crowded house to the Alcazar last
night, and the large audience was kept
in good humor by the funny situations To- i
bias Pilkington. a stockbroker, got Into !
through deceiving his wife as to a trip to
Boston. .From the opening of the play to
its close there Is not a dull moment. Eu
gene Ormonde, as the stockbroker, showed
that as a comedian he ranks high. He is
Irresistibly funny, and he does it in a

Chutes.
Baby Ruth, the cutest little fairy Im
aginable, pauig and danoed herself Into Im
mediate favor at the Chutes Theater last
night. The large audience rewarded her
work with four encores. The Rousells,
who disjoint themselves on the horizontal
bar in an extraordinary way, were new,
as wore also the Frlodlander Brothers,
really amusing musical comedians. Adgie
continued her Geisha girl dance in thf
cage of lions, some now moving pictures
were shown and the rest of the bill was
up to the Chutes standard. The high
divers are still In evidence and Princess,
the new elephant In the Zoo, attracted
much 'attention.

formation that Bert Morrison, a young
California actor, has been engaged as

rison made his debut at Morosco's about
three years ago, and left for New York
two months ago to try his fortunes In a
larger field. He gives promise of a rapid
rise In his profession.
COURT NOTES.
Judge Murasky has given Judgment for
the defendant In the case of G. Gilletti
' against W. Wykes. Gilletti sought to're
j cover $299 damages from the defendant on

' mirror in his icecream parlors. The case
was decided by Judge Murasky on appeal
: from the Justices' Court and he finds
that the claim of the plaintiff is â without
i merit.

PARK PETS' NEW HOME.
There is to be a new deer and buffalo
paddotk in Golden Gate Park- one that
. will excel the present cramped quarters
j occupied by these animals. Such was the
dt-cision of the Park Commit
! their last meeting. The old paddock will
! not be wholly abandoned, but in th<
: there are to be a< commodations that tne
present ones do not afford. The pi>
: lected is the low land west of 9
I Hill named Zeile Mi â  the Com
, missioners. This pie<-< of ground contains
about twenty acres, all of which lii
i ty-tive feet lower than the several drives
, around it. It is one of the most pictur
! esque spots in the park and from the
surrounding roads an unobstructed view
of the entire meadow may be ootained.
; On account of the acreage there is no
i danger of the grass being trodden down
1 and destroyed by the animals.
Superintendent McLaren will see that
the lawns are kept moist and the grass
growing all the year round. The inclos
ure will require twenty-four miles of
wire fencing eight feet high, which is to
be put In as soon as posa We, The pub
lic's pets will be mov.-d to their new
quarters in about a month. The old pad
dock will still be occupied by some of the
animals, which it may prove advisable
to ke<p apart from the main herd. The
Commissioners propose to make the deer
park one of the principal features and
attractions of Golden Gate Park.

CONFERENCE OF
THE METHODIST
CHURCH SOUTH
Dr. Kenney to Make
Opening Address.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Oct. 2.
To-morrow evening- the Methodist
Church South will open its annual con
ference with the preaching of the intro
ductory sermon by Her. J. J. N. Kenney,
presiding- elder of Fresno district.
The conference will be under the super
intendence of Bishop Duncan, who has
been appointed to the Pacific conference
since last year, and this will be his first
appearance at a coast conference. L^ast
year an important change was made in
the arrangement of the various districts.
There had previously been flvf presiding
elders, each over a district, but last year
the number was reduced to three and
their duties extended over much more
territory. Reports on the working of this
new rule will he made and it is thought
they will show that especially in the
northern part of the State the duties of
the presiding elder have been more ex
acting than he could attend to with per
fect satisfaction.
The conference will be held at the As
bury Methodist Church South and will
extend throughout the balance of the
week.

ROMANCE OF A
POOR YOUNG MAN
AIRED IN COURT
Geo. Everett Did Not
Pay Alimony.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Oct. 2.
A real romance of an unfortunate young
man was aired in Superior Judge Hall's
court this afternoon. The young man was
George C. Everett, on whose behalf his
attorney, L. J. Harvey Jr.. had petitioned
the court for a modification of an order
for $15 monthly alimony incorporated in
a decree of divorce granted to Mary E.
Everett in February, 1898. Everett is aged
33 years and hlh divorced wife has passed
her fiftieth summer.
The divorce was granted on the ground
of extreme cruelty and the trial at the
time proved decidedly sensational. It was
shown that the couple had lived together
happily but two weeks, when the husband
manifested an unusual personification of
the green-eyed monsti r. expressing jeal
ousy over the daily visits of the milkman,
the butcher, the baker and the candle
stick maker, and even the iceman was not
free from Everett's suspicion. As a sum
mary measure Mrs. Everett finally bun
dled* her jealous spouse out of the house
and sued for a divorce.
Everett was formerly a theological stu
dent, but, according to Mrs. Everett's
allegations, corroborated by three wit
nesses at the divorce trial, his capacity
for line liquors was hardly in accord with
his chosen calling. On one occasion, too,
he became decidedly ferocious, drawing a
revolver on his spouse. For this he was
arrested. His plea was to have been in
sanity, and at the suggestion of his at
torneys he was examined by doctors, who
declared him Found mentally. However,
tha f case was dropped, the wife declining
to swear to a complaint.
After the divorce was granted Everett
claimed to have come across a letter,
supposedly written by his ex-wife, where
in some unknown writer advised her to
keep out of Everett's path, "warning ' her
"what a slick devil Everett is. Polished,
but oh, so bad! He is said to he insane,
but this is not bo, for he is devilish to the
core." â
On the witness stand to-day Everett
pleaded poverty and sickness. He said
the only work he had performed since the
entering of the decree was in Pendleton,
Or. where, some weeks ago, he had
watered his sister's grass lawn. He
claimed to be a sufferer from nervous
prostration, functional heart trouble,
stomach trouble and fainting spells and
that he was now dependent upon the
charity of relatives.
He had contended in previous testimony
that his claim to illness and complications
had been verified by Drs. Russell and
Bradley, but Mrs. Everett in expounding
her version of these matters declared that
the doctors had told her they considered
Everett a well man and that Dr. Russell
had advised him to don his old clothes
and go to work; but the doctor expressed
doubts as to Everett's ability to follow
or succeed in a professional life.
The ex-wife apparently labored under
the impression that Everett is not a poor
man for she made the startling declara
tion that a Mrs. C. Henry of I'kiah had
told her that Everett had been making
money and that he had been lavishing
presents on her. Moreover, Mrs. Everett
gave impetus to a rumor that her ex-hus
band was engaged to be married again.
Mrs. Everett was represented at the
hearing to-day by Attorney E. C. Robin
son, who made an eloquent plea that Ev
erett's petition be denied. In fact, the
attorney declared that his client is
afraid of her life and that Everett has
not paid one cent of the alimony or
dered.
Judge Hall gently stroked his beard as
lie summed up the case and mused the
preliminary remarks to his decision. "I
think there is something wrong in the
young man's upper story, ' said his Honor.
""The fact of his marrying a woman 50
years old Is evidence of that, and I think
the doctor was quite right when he said
tills defendant would never make a pto
fesslonal man. On the other hand, this
plaintiff Is able to support herself, and
him. too, for that matter, if he'd behave
himself. Possibly there is some vocation
whe:eby he can realize enough to support
himself.
"He has nothing now, and It Is not the
policy of the law to keep a millstone
about a man forever. Of course, if he
rhiuld be struck by lightning and inherit
something, it would all be very well, but
we cannot disturb the past; so I can see
no reason f"r not modifying the order."
Judge Hall accordingly modified the de
cree by striking the future payment of
alimony until further order of the court,

TOLD OF FOOTPADS
AND WENT TO JAIL
OAKLAND, Oct. 2â J. Parente. a Por
tuguese laborer, aped 40 years, was found
lyinK near an oak tree just off a side-
I waik in West Oakland at 1 o'clock this
morning. His cries for help aroused a
whole neighborhood, and the police took
him to the Receiving Hospital to be treat
ed for a broken nose. He was very much
intoxicated, and claimed that footpads
had laid him out and robbed him of $5.
After his olfactory organ had been re
paired he became so obstreperous that ne
had to be removed to the City Prison,
where he was booked for drunkenness.
When ho appeared in the Police Court
this morning the footpad theory had
slipped his memory, and he was sen
tenced to serve four days in jail, the court
reasoning that the prisoner had already
been quite sufficiently punished for nis
Inebriety by running up against some
mighty oak.

OAKLAND. Oct. 2.â The Alameda

Oakland, not later than October 16. Dr.
Miller, who is president of Eden Town
ship, has gone over part of his district
and counted the houses, and will thus be

using the fire insurance maps to divide
their territory, as they show every house.

enthusiastic over the scheme to canvass
the county in a day and they do not in
tend to let the work stop when they have
done this.

RAILROAD MEN
MAY OBJECT TO
LONGER HOURS
All Freight to Come
Through Niles.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 2.
Beginning with the first of October, & I
very important and sweeping change ha<B
gone into effect in the freight service be
tween San Jose and south, and Oakland.
All the freight trains which have hnherto
gone to San Francisco and been ferried to
Oakland will be sent by way of Niles.
There is no night telegraph station be
tween San Jose and Oakland, and train
men are fearful that there will be many
accidents unless some changes are made i
in the new system. They Bay it is impos-
Bible to have three or four freight trains
between San Jose and Oakland at night
time without their being mixed up unless
they receive some orders en route. The
new conditions will increase the freight :
traffic on this side the bay to fully double
what it has been.
Many of the men, especially the opera- !
tors at Niles, have been working over
time under the old conditions and they
have determined to claim ten hours' con-
Becutlve rest according to the agreement [
entered into with the railroad company ;
under the new schedule adopted and |
which went into effect September 1. At j
present the hours of rest for the men on |
this route are considerably broken up f.nd j
they are not able to have the amount of
consecutive hours agreed on.
S. O. Higley, the ajrent at Niles. has to
sell tickets, check baggage, take train or
ders while trains are in the station, be- .
sides answering all questions that passen
gers may ask. Often there are half a
dozen different orders on the agent's desk
at Niles". with as many different trains in
the yard. On the local train service the
new conditions and the possibility of ac
cidents have been the theme of passen
gers for the past two days.

GENTLEMEN'S NIGHT AT
THE OLYMPIC CLUB
Insurance Men to Be the Guests of
the Institution To-Morrow
Night.
An interestir.gr time is in prospect for
the employes of the- various Insurance
companies of the city at the Olympic Ath
letic Club to-morrow night. The invita
tion extended by that populai^institutio*
to the clerks of the insurance companies
has bten eagerly accepted and they will
till the clubrooms to overflowing to-mor
row evening.
Leader Jonn E. Hammersmith has ar
rangt-d an excellent programme for the
club s quests. There will be boxing, wrest
ling, lencing and gymnastic exnibitions
by the leading athletes of the institution.
It will be in every sense a "Gentlemen s
Night/? and every effort . will be exerted
to make It a memorable evening's enter
tainment. , . ',
Mr. Hammersmith has a surprise in
store for all who attend. It is in the shape
of a trio of Filipinos, who do some won
derful work on the rings and the Roman
ladder. Augistine has created a deep im
pression on Mr. Hammersmith and other
well-known athletes. His arms are so
finely developed that he is able to do in
numerable tricks wuh hi? lithe body, while
in the swinging rings. Tista and a small
Filipino will entertain with some daring
tricks on the ladder.
S. Simpson and C. Millwood, two well
known heavyweights, will pummel each
other, as will a bo "Welterweights P. J.
Racioni and J. F. McCarthy; Middle
weight F. Ast and J. McDonald and Light
weiarhts W. J. Leonard and Willie Cole.
Some hard slugging is looked for in a few
of the bouts as the men will try hard to
impress the spectators with their prowess.
Harry Cobb and J. J. Phillips and Ar
thur Bruman and W. H. King ".ill give
a wrestlintr exhibition. Professor Tron
chet and E. Ortin will have a bout with
the foils and Paul Sere and G. Fisher will
do likewise.
A junior class was formed at the club
last night. It will consist of high school
athletes, ranging from 17 to 20 years of
aie. Seventy-five plications have al
ready been received' by young men who
are anxious to join. The directors of the
club have permitted this innovation as
they believe the young athletes will in
time form the bone and sinew of the in
stitution. .

That the taxpayers in the proposed

t>y the Board of Supervisors yesterday
Â«.ftÂ©rnoon. It was the intention of Mayor
Phelan and the members of the commis
sion to keep the. figures a dead secret until
cfter the panhandle election had taken
place and the result be>en announced. The

Jnotlon of the board to open the report
that the publication of the figures would

praised at a figure lower than that fixed

I that the Mayor considered that a knowl
i edge of the valuations fixed would create
j inure ur less dissatisfaction among the
taxpayers Interested ami the anticipated
favorable result of the election would ot
: a consequence be jeopardized.
The Supervisors. However, took the
i other side of the question. They held
that every property owner along tnp line,
in order to vote Intelligently at the forth
ci ming election, should be Informed of
Just me status of his possessions as re
gards to municipal plans. As LÂ»r. Per
: rault, chairman of tne Finance Commit-
I tee, said after the meeting, "There ar<
tors and lawyers and other professional
people and bakers and business men 111
that district, the success of whose profes
sions and trades depends largely upon the
length of their residence in the locality.
Their values are not confined Bolely to
their realty and improvements, hut large
ly to the fact that they have established
places of business In the community. This
j value was not reckoned by the appraisers,
i yet in some cases it exceeds the b
, value of the holdings. Condemn the
| homes and places of business of surh m<n
i and they are forced into other neighbor
hoods, whore they will suffer a compara
! tive loss until they have beÂ»n there such
a time as to have built up another prac-
I tlce or list of customers."
It was from this standpoint and from
the other point that every man had the
right to know just what plans the city
contemplated with regards to his property
that the Supervisors looked at the ques
tion yesterday and seeing it in that light
they voted to open the report, file it and
rr Â£? r il to the Finance Committee.
The proposed new City and County Hos
pital also came in for gome little further
discussion. Under the original resolution
empowering the medical and art associa
| tlons to select a board to supervise any
I plans that might bo submitted, only the
; County Medical Society was recognized
I and a good-sized kick went up from the
: < ollogo of Physicians and Surgeons, as
members of the Clinical Society. Cooper
Mf-dical College and every other like In
stitution in the city. The same old bltter
i ness that has existed for years among the
I doctor factories found a fresh vent, and
i the roar was loud and long. In framing
, the original resolution Supervisor Per
i raiilt was ignorant of these factional feel-
I Ings and unintentionally slighted every
| one save members of the County Soctetv.
He squared himself yesterday by amend
| ing his first resolution to include Cooper
Medical College, the College of Physicians
; and Surgeons and the University of Cali
fornia Medical Department and two
others to be appointed by the Art Asso
, elation.

I this and other excesses the following

Opinions were handed down yesterday
as follows by the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals:
Several cases in which the Mutual Life
Insurance Company of New York was the
appellant and Bessie F. Sears, Walter D
Allen, Pine Cohen and George E. Hill and
others were the appellees. They repre
sented the estates of dead men who had
taken out policies of life insurance in tne
company ranging from $2000 up to $20,000
In each case. The insured paid one or two
premiums and then refused to pay any
more and their policies were by the com*
pany declared void and canceled. The
executors and heirs sued the insurance
company for the full amount of the policy
All the facts were admitted and the lower
courts gave judgments against the com
pany, the total aggregating about $39,000
I and more. The opinion handed down yes
terday affirms the Judgment of the lower
court. The opinion, after summing- up the
evidence, goes on to say:
Upon these facts admitted upon the pleadings,
It is ilear that the court did not err In sus
taining the demurrer to the answer and ren
i dering the Judgment In favor of the executrix
' for $7448, with interest and rosts. There was
no issue raised by the pleadings. The parties
could not waive the provisions of the statute
of New York which expresses the conditions
upon which a policy might be forfeited for
non-payment of premiums. The New York
statute lias been regarded as Indicative of the
i legislative will and intent that life insurance
i companies shall be deprived of the power to
declare policies forfeited for non-payment of
premiums, except In the mode prescribed by
the statute.

boy, but before the lad could get out of

him on the back and he fell, and one of
the wheels passed over him.
