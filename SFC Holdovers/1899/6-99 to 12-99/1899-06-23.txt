CHAOS IN
POLITICS
OF FRANCE
How the Dreyfus Affair Has
Turned Bitter Enemies
Into Warm Friends.

HeraM. Copyrighted, IS??, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS. June 22. â
j â Dreyfus affair has turned
political parties topsy-tur
vey. It has made revolutionists
of former conservatives, conser
vatives of those who used to be
socialists or even anarchists. The.
existing conflict, in its real as
pect, is between the parties that
have been arrayed against one
another since [789. On one side
are the reactionists, comprising
the imperialists and royalists; on
the other the republicans, divided
into numerous sections, ranging
from conservatives to the most
extreme socialists. Each has
seized upon the Dreyfus affair as
a pretext for furthering its own j
aims and secret aspirations, thus
giving to it an importance for
eign to its character and magni
tude, and out of all proportion
to its judicial importance.
\ficr twenty-nine years of the
republic, as the Temps remark-,
open opposition to that form of
government i> both dangerous
and futile. Reactionary parties do
not accept it. but thinking it best
not t' > shout "A bas 1c republi
que," cry "Vive l'armee" on the
theory thai the party which has
the army at its back will have a
formidable weapon against the
ruling powers..
<>n the other hand, there are
many under the republican ban
ner \\h<>. as Dreyfusards, are
likewise taking advantage of the
situation to advance their favor
ite objects, for which they have
been long openly fighting. They
cry. "Vive la justice." which with
them means "Vive la revolution
sociale," or "A bas les clerica."
The socialists claim, through
the Lanterne and their other or
gans, that the key to the situa
tion is held by the moderates,!
and on them must fall responsi
bility for the consequences of
failure. The moderates retort
that they are as strongly opposed i
to socialists of the extreme left,
who cry "Let no guilty man es
The San Francisco Call.
cape" as they are to the reac
tionists of the right, who go to
the other extreme by insisting
on the infallibility of the court
martial, declaring that to upset
a court-marital is to assail the
army. To run to either excess
is. in the opinion of the moder
ates, to invite civil war and im-
peril the republic.
Extreme socialists^ sftbuting
"Vive la justice," reply that the
safety off he republic depend- on
the punishment of the guilty,
while the reactionaires, with
their cry of "Vive l'armee," insist
I that the acquittal of Dreyfus
will be but the forerunner of
civil war. Each party declares
that salvation is only to be
found on it- >i<ie. The truth
probably, as usual, will be found
midway between the two ex
tremes.
The appointment of General
the Mar<|uis tie Gallifet as Min
ister of War in the new Cabinet
is an extraordinary example of
the. way in which the Dreyfus
case has revolutionized political
conditions. For years past the
general has been the bugaboo
of the extremists, not only be
cause of his monarchical ser
vices, but on account of the rig
orous part he took in repressing
the commune. ! [is entry into
the Cabinet is undoubtedly due
to his attitude toward the Drey
fus.case. which has been througli
oui favorable to Dreyfus.
though he holds thai the procla
mation of the prisoner's inno
cence should not include placing
the responsibility for the appar-J
lent judicial blunders upon the
genera] staff.
Le Courrier Au Soir publishes
an interview this evening with
< ieneral the Marquis de ( iallifct. |
the new Minister of War. who is!
represented as saying: "I am
reproached for my attitude in ;
IN7I. At that time I served the
majority, the constitution and
the law as a soldier on the active
list. J have remained silent until
now. To-day 1 find the army
talking far too much. 1 am, as
] was thirty years ago, at the ser
vice of the majority, the constitu

radical socialist, in an interview |
published by the same paper, is
represented as saying: "The re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
It does not lessen the wrong
committed against the civil law in
Idaho to reflect that the men en
trusted with the enforcement of
the decrees of the military author
ities are purchasable â and pur
chasabfe at a cheap rate. Prison- \
ers brought from the Bull Pen at
Kellogg may escape the indignity
of confinement in the County Jail
at Wallace upon payment of a pal
try $4 each to their jailer. If a man \
does not pay the $4, back he goes
into jail. Military rule is certainly
baa. Military rule tainted with
corruption is atrocious.
WALLACE, Idaho, June 22.âRu
mors that the actions of tbe
officials under martial law were
largely controlled by money
have been prevalent here all ahmgr, but
the first authentic instance oÂ£ bribery
came to lipht to-day. Prisoners brought
from the hull pen to attend court are
confined in tho County Jail while in
Wallace, but those who are able and
willing to contribute $4 to the deputy
may escape this confinement. Sheriff
Young and the < 'commissioners thus
purchased their liberty for last nipht.
but to-day, on refusing to be further
"held up. " they were compelled to go
j back to jail.
Kisrhty miners brought from Missouri,
aching Spokane and learning they
would 'Â»â  cOrrrpWiud to Â«iÂ«'n permitu be
fore going to work, refused to come
further. They are mostly union men,
and were induced to leave their homos !
' by assurances that thpy would not be
asked to supplant members of organ
ized labor unions. Very few miners are
coming in and the mines apparently
will not lie able to resume operations
for many months unless union labor is
employed.
Another party of Missouri miner?, for
the Standard, is expected to-night,
: coming from Tekoa on a special train.
Parl of their baggage arrived to.-day.
When this party left Missouri it num
ber* il 130, but a number deserted on the
way. All the way a ions the line repre
sentatives Â«'f labor organizations have
been trying to induce the men not to
come and some have stopped over.
To-morrow Is the last day allowed
the eight defendants arraigned on
'â  Tuesday to plead to the indictments
' against, them. Their attorneys will
present a motion to quash the indict
ments in each case. The principal
I ground for the metion will be that the
Grand Jury was selected and summoned
bj Coroner France, who had for years
been an employe of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan Company, whose mill was
destroyed, and that every member of
the Grand Jury was either an active
supporter or an employe of the com
: pany, although France was ordered by
the court to go to distant parts of the
1 county and select men who Would be
least, likely t<- have any interest in the
matter. Should the motion be sqs
tained a new Grand Jury would have
to ho summoned, which would delay the
trials probably a m<>nth.
THE NEW CABINET
HAS MANY FOES
Freely Predicted by Its Enemies That
It Will Not Last a
Week.
PARIS, Juno 22.â The Cabinet is a
Btrong combination and is wholly in fa
vor of Dreyfus, l>ut Bince it contains
sin h extreme men OB Marquis do <;alli
fel an<l M. Millerand, it can hardly be
expected to have a long career. The
Sociallsi party has already declared
that it will not in any way be bound
by or responsible for M. Millerand's
acts as a Minister. The latter, however.
is :\ powerful debater, who will share
I with M. Wuldeck-Rousseau the brunt of
defending the Cabinet in the Chamber,
most of the Ministers being far less
' skilled in debate.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau, who is perhaps
the most successful pleader at the
French bar, loses an income of Â£120.000
by becoming Minister. M. de Lanes
san. Minister of Marine, is famous for
his advocacy of the Anglo-French en
tr-uto.
M. Jean Dupuy, Minister of Agricul
ture, is no relative of the former Pre
mier.
Except in connection with the Drey
lus affair, the new ministry has little
interest and is received rather coolly.
The Dreyfusites are delighted and the
anger of the anti-Dreyfusites knows no
bounds. Its opponents predict that the
Cabinet will fall next Monday, owing
to the Incongruous combination of Mar-
quis de Gallifet and M. Millerand.
It is understood no Cabinet will per
m.'l - meeting between Dreyfus and his
wife. Brest remains calm. Its inhabi
tants fire for the greater part Dreyfus
ites. and it is said there would be no
danger of a hostile demonstration even
if Dreyfus landed durlne the day time.

CONDITION OF AFFAIRS
IN THE TRANSVAAL
The following- extract from a letter
written by Howard Rridgewater, a
young Englishman residing in Johan
nesburg, to a relative in this city, gives
an, excellent idea of the feeling at pres
ent existing in the Transvaul:
Here we are in imminent danger of war
(in which case poor men would suffer ter
ribly), which state of things the capital
ists are responsible for. The people arÂ©
contented enough and there would be no
suggestion of war but for the newspaper*!,
which foment bad feeling. Few Brit
ishers want the franchise nr would take
it if offered them, for how many desire
for a mess of pottage to renounce alle
giance to the. Queen? The worst of it is
that the Pretoria Government is so cor
rupt, and that the capitalists have a
case which they can magnify, as they
are doing, for their own ends â with the
help of newspapers, which state that it
is the people who want war. It. is a lie.
Most of the grievances affect the mining
magnates, who, because they can't Ret
them reformed, use their money to cre
ate "crises" witli the idea of bullying
Kruger to climb down. T am no upholder
of bad government, whether it affect--- me
or Dot, but if one has a grievance I think
it should be complained of by that man.
It does not strike me as just that he
should complain of it behind a dummy.
The poorer people of the Transvaal con
stitute the dummy in the present in
stance, and If there is any suffering to
follow it is this dummy who will get the
full benetit of it.
The mine meetings that you rend of are
all organized by the magnates, who are
secure fiom anything like united opposi
tion because every one in Johannesburg
is more or less dependent upon them, and
(but in a much lesser degrr-ei because th<*
people do not. as I have said, care to say
anything about grievances. Rut the peo
ple are distinctly against theso capitalistic
grievances being made to appear as theirs
and being made a rasus belli in tlielr
nameâ which is the position hero to-day.
The more l study this business tho rror<>
I am convinced that Rhodes is at the bot
tom <>f it. Although he is, of course, in
terested to a largo extent in the Trans
vaal from a monetary point of view Hk*
the rest of them, lie la doubtless actuated
also by ambition. It was finite manifest
after the affairs that be was the prim"
mover of the raid <>f '95 -which failed.
And "1 submit further that lie is not the*
man to sit down pnder failure. Whether
this attempt, on the country's independ
ence will succeed remains to be seen. Per
sonally. T think not. There is not enough
of the true ring in the agitation in spite,
of the fact that as much local color as
possible is put into the picture. 1 read,
for instance, in to-night's Star that this
is "essetially a worldngman's struggle for
political freedom." ! fancy it will be,
news to most of them. Rut that doesn't

sumption in Kngland.

Jame? McNaughton, who was recently
elected principal of the State Normal

charges are made nsJiinst McNaugtiton
when he was Superintendent . of the

with Incompeteney and immorality. It
If stated that after school hours the Su

taining lewd and d!Â«solut< characters in
the schoolhouses; also of loaning money
to gamblers and fast women at high rates
of interest and doing other thir.rs un

AGER DISAGREES WITH
HAVEMEYER'S VIEWS
j Says the Trust of Fanners Would BÂ«
Impracticable, as They Would
Not Stand Together.
WASHINGTON. June 22.â Joseph B.
Ager, president of the Maryland State
Grange, Patrons of Husbandry, was be
: fore the Industrial Committee to-day. He
said a trust among the farmers such as .
i was suggested by Mr. Havemeyer was '
i impracticable, owing to the difficulty of
gating the farmers to hold up prices,
peaking of colored labor, he said it was '
; unreliable because of the natural Indo- i
i lence and indifference of individuals of i
| the race. Liquor he regarded as the j
treat bane of that people and responsible I
, or nine-tenths of the crimes committed:
â  by them. Mr. Ager considered the condi- â 
! tion of the average farmer as worse than i
: it was twenty years ago. but he believed 1
money investeu in farming safer than in J
i other lines of business. He attributed !
! the numoer of abandoned farms in the j
j States to the fact that they were owned
by non-residents. . â 
Mr. Ager said the Grange was not so >
I prosper is in point of numbers as for- i
i merly and he attributed the falling oft*
; largely to the fact that the grange could I
; not be used in. politics.
FINDS FATHER'S CHARRED
REMAINS IN BURNED HOUSE
Terrible Discovery Made by a Young
Miner Upon Returning to
His Home.
VANCOUVER. B. c, June 22.â Return-
Ing home anrl finding his father's house
burned and his charred bones among the
smoldering ruins was the sad experience
of John Musgrave. .He is a young miner
of -non. one of th* town? In the in
terior of British Columbia. His father,
Jerry Musgrave, formerly of Winnipeg,
lived alone in the Salmon River country!
about sixty miles in the mountains from
Vernon. A few days ago young Mu.'cnv
went home, and to-day he arrived in
town with a tale of horror. He related
that he arrived home last Tuesday night
and was surprised to find' that the house
where his father bad lived wan burned
down. The place was a mile away from
any other settler, ami the old man, be
ing of eccentric habits, was not often
seen by any person. He had, however
disappeared since the fire and no one
could find any trace of him. Next morn
ing young Musgrsivt- made a search of
the ruin* and found his father's bones
lying near where his bed had stood Just
beside him were two hinges lying In such
a position as to Indicate that they were
parts of a trap door, and the peculiar
crouch of the old man's form led to
further investigation. The whole place
was carefully searched, as the probability
was that some money at least would be
found in the vicinity. The searchers were
not, however, prepared for the surprise
that awaited them Just underneath the
old man's body and in the direction that
he had evidently been reaching wa*
found a bag of money. The cloth was of
course, burned from around the coin,- but
the cash was in gold of the realm of
I nele Sam. There were several thou
sands of dollars.
Musgrave several times requested that
if he should have any money when he died
it should be applied to a church fund in
the East, and this is where all the cash
will go. The other mdtnbers of the family
are dead. J

ST. LOUIS, June 22.-The principal
events of the Elks' reunion to-day were
the prize drill at the Coliseum and the
meeting of the Grand Lodge. The hand
contests also attracted considerable at
tention. ThTe are six band? entered in
the contest for the three prizes of $1000,
$.VÂ») and $2'".
At the drill contest which opened at th*Â»
Coliseum thJp forenoon Captain Rum
bold of Battery A and Captains Brim
paman and Holtcamp of the First Mis
souri Regiment acted a* judges. There
wcrf only, two contestants" â the Toledo
Cherry Kickers commanded by Captain
.W. H. Cook, and the Louisville Lodge
t*am, commanded by Captain John H.
leathers.
The Toledo dri 1 ! team, composed of
thirty-two m^-n two guides and three offi
cers, marched Into the arena first, headed
by Strobe!'^ They made a go<">^ im
pression in their undress uniforms of red
flannel, whit'- shoes and !>lue cape. White
umbrellas were carried in lieu of g\;ns.
Most of th<*ir movements were according
to Upton's tactic? and wtp performer
with a predstoj tl tbi tght forth much
applause. After the drill was over it
M-*med to be the general opinion that the
Toledo company Wits th" 1 more soldierly of
the two.
There w*re only twenty-four men. two
guides and^Three officers- In the Louis
ville <lrill team, but for all that they made
a nn*> appearance in their fatigue uni
forms of white. They wore caps of
the same color and carried white canes.
This f-am drilled by "three." and their
movements were more fanciful than tl
of their competitors. The judir>-Â« will
probably make known their decision this
afternoon. The Grand Ledge went into
n early to-day, with the intention
of Transacting the business before it and
adjourning as soon as possible.
After considerable debate the proposi
tion to < s-iablish an insurance feature in
the order was rejected on the ground that
I was obligatory #on the subordinate
lodges to assist members.
The report of th*> credentials comm:t
--:â¢â - showed that 2L*>. out of a total of Vs-i
members of the Grand Lodge, were pres
ent. During the past year seventy- â¢
new lodges have been granted charters.
A â  port from th-~- committee on lawg and
appeals was against the establishment vi
the office of financial secretary. The sug
gestlon to change memorial day from tiie
first Sunday ir December to the fourth
Sunday In September was not sustained.
Provision was made for the establish
ment of a home for agerf. destitute
indicant members. A resident of Bedf. .'<l
Ind.. not a member of the order, whose
name w,-iÂ« not made public, offered to

OPPOSED TO TUITION TEES.
Alden Anderson Does Not Indorse the
Action of Reg-exits.
SUISUN, June 22.â Public sentiment
does not seem to Indorse the action of
the regents of the University of Califor
nia in the matter of tuition fee for stu
dents. In an interview held with Regent
Alden Anderson, that gentleman said that
at the two previous meetings when this
proposition was advanced he voto.l
against the proposed assessment, and
each time the motion met with over
whelming defeat. He was unavoidably
absent when the matter again" came up,
but he strongly favors a reconsideration
of the question, and hopes that the or
der assessing students $20 a year for at
tending the college will be rescined He
also suggested that if some understand
ing with the Governor cannot be arrived
at in regard to the anticipated deficiency
that the friends of the university be- given
an opportunity to make up the amount by
popular subscription.

SUDDEN DEATH
OF J. B. H. COOPER
MONTEREY, June 22.â J. B. H. ;
Cooper, a wealthy land owner |
and capitalist of this 'county, j
who has for the past few years j
resided in San Francisco, died j
suddenly last night at his ranch south}
of this city, where he was spending the j
summer with his family. He retired at ;
9 o'clock in apparently excellent health, j
but shortly afterward his wife entering j
his room found Him dead in his bed. :
The cause of death was acute heart j
disease.
Juan Bautisto Henrique Cooper was
born in Monterey in 1530, his parents
being noted California pioneers. Cup
tain J. B. R. Cooper, who came to Mon
terey in 1*2:?. and Doha Encarnacion
Vallejo Cooper, sister of the celebrated
General If. G. Vallejo, and was edu
cated in the Sandwich Islands with
other California young men who have
since become prominent. Inherit:... a
large property from his* father, he has
since preatly increased it, his present i
estate being estimated at over $2,000,
--000, including Morro Cojo, El Sur and â¢
San Bernabe ranches in Monterey
County, ranch property in Sonoma
County and San Francisco real estate.
He took a prominent part in early Cali
fornia affairs, but would never accept
office. He was Supervisor of Monterey
County nine years, this being the only
public office he ever held. He was close-, ;
ly related to the Del Valles, Leeses and I
UNEVENTFUL DAY
AT CONVENTION
Electioneering of Ken
tucky Democrats.
Bjvcial Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, June 22.â The second
day of the Democratic convention was
a i'.ank. bo far as proceedings of rec
ord go. Under the surface, however,
it was the busiest day of electioneer
ing and wire-pulling incident to the
gathering. Two short sessions were
held, one in the morning and one in
the evening. At the former commit
tees wen appointed and a recess was
taken until evening to allow them to
work. This evening a? the credential
committee had scarcely <>esun its work,
the convention adjourned until 5
o'clock to-morrow morning.
This committee will have t<-> dispose
of p'> m <=: WO seats. Its deliberations .
will govern the length of the conven
tion, and if radical action be taken in
any one direction it may effectively in
lluence the nominations. The Stone-
Qoebel combination is still master of
th^ situation, having control of the ma
chinery of the convention. Thto was
demonstrated twice to-day in the forc
ing of an adjournment.
Chairman Ked-.vinÂ«'and the other tem
porary officers it is believed will bÂ» re
tained in the permanent organization.
To-night th- Hardin people are busily
\v.,rk:ng on the Stnne delegates, for it
is in this direction their only hope iies.
They are u^ing the argument that the
Goebel followers are using the Bteme
: combination for pureij- t--insn
ses, and that they will attempt
to nominate the Kenton County leader
for Governor regardless of the tacit un
derstanding that Btone should receive
this prize. Meanwhile, there is no sign
of weaknese in the rombination. Stone
or (Joebel may be nominated for Gover- .
nor and the report of the committee .in
credentials may decide the race. The
mako-up of the remainder of the ticket
will depend upon the selection for Gov- ;
ernor.
The platf'Tm -will declare for Bryan
and sliver and is likely to contain an
anti-trust plank.
THE PASSING OF AN
ECCENTRIC LAWYER
Death of Martin V. Biscailuz, Who
Gained Prominence at Los
Angeles.
LOS ANGELES. June 22.â The life of
the most familiar character known to Los
Angeles came to an end when Martin V.
Blscailuz. the eccentric French lawyer,
died at the County Hospital this morn
ing. The lawyer, who was known to every
old-timer, was born' here forty-three
years ago. v His parents died while h^
was very young, which compelled him to
make his own way. He began as a
herder of one of the thousands of flocks
of sheep which at that time roamed
around Los Angeles. Biscailuz, the sheep
herder, as he tended his flock by night,
began to dream of days when he would
become rich and famous. The herder
saved his monthly pittance until he had
enough to pay his way through school
and a law college in the East. After
finishing he came back to Los Angeles
and began to practice law among the
French and Basques. The Basque lan
guage is extremely difficult,, and because
of his knowledge of thÂ«Â» foreign tongue
he acquired a large clientage.
Biscailuz prospered and built a" magnifi
cent home, where he lived with hi? wife.
He drove fine horses and lived in luxury.
Eight years ago he was retained as an
attorney in the Oxarat estate case, and
for hi*- services received the largest fee
ever received by a lawyer in Southern
California, viz.. $36,000. After receiving
the money he took a trip to Europe and.
was absent over a year. After his return
he began to go down at a rapid rate.
Long addicted to the use of absinthe, he
resorted to dishonest means to secure
money. The Masons tried to save him
from inevitable ruin. Hi* wife secured a
divorce and married Captain Hunter, who
Is a relative of the family that was mur
dered by Craig, who paid the death pen
alty for hia crime.

will, I am told, be consulfed in regard
to plans for extending foreign com
merce, which is to become a feature of
th<=> new department.
President McKinley*9 policy in regard :
t" the future form t>f goyernm^nt for.
the Philippines and Cuba is still un
defined, but regardless of what future
developments may bring forth a? to
our attitude toward those islands, he
and the members of th>- Cabinet fully '
appreciate that military governments
in all our dependencies must glv^ way
to civil government as speedily as pos
srble. Preliminary to the establishment
of civil government, the Cabinet has
occluded that there should be a new
civil department, with a Cabinet offi
cer at its head, to inaugurate and have
control of th* 3 new governments which,
sooner or later, must be farmed.
A Cabinet officer thus explained to
me to-day the necessity for such de- ]
partment. "At th<> prf-s.T.t tim- there
is no central head for the consideration
of the multifarious qu-stions constant- I
ly arising in connection with Cuba,
Porto Rico. Hawaii and th*> Philip
pines. The War Department has con
tTOl of these matters now. but there are
many questions, financial, administra
tive, judicial, commercial and diplo
matic, which our army officers are not
competent to deal with and ought not I
be required to pass upon. As matters
go now. there is a disposition to shift
from one department to another and
from one bureau to another to escape
responsibility for settling intricate and
embarrassing questions.
"A territorial form of government for
Porto Rico ynd Hawaii h?.s already
been agreed upon, and there is little
doubt- that the next Congress will pass
measures in this direction. The Presi
dent told a friend the other day that
he favored a government for Porto Rico
similar to that of Arizona, and that if
it were ir his power he would appoint a
civil governor for Porto Rico at. once
Without waiting for legislation by Con
gress.
'Though the War Department will in
all probability remain in nominal con- j
trol of Cuba for some time to come, ;
there will be many questions arising
that ought to be passed upon by the
proposed new colonial department. The
same may be said of the Philippines.
The collection and distribution of th<?
revenue of those Islands, aggregating
already 12*000,000 a month in two plÃ'-es.
ought to go into the hands of experts
with a proper system of accounting and
under a single civilian h<>ad."

ADDITIONAL TROOPS
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
PRESIDENT
TO AUTHORIZE
ENLISTMENT
Otis' Command Will Soon Be
Strengthened by Ten
Regiments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, June 22.âPresi
dent McKinley will authorize
the enlistment of additional
men for the Philippines when
vims to Washing-tun. 'This is the
understanding of well-informed War
Department officials. The administra
tion has. al last, come to recognize the
necessitj of reinforcing General Otis'
command, which has been so persist
ently pointed out.
It was apparent to-day that some of
I the department officials an- figuring on
the advisability of enlisting men to
form t. n complete regiments. Wh"n I
asked Acting Secretary of War Meikle
-1 John on this point he told me if the
President authorised additional men
ih.' number would be determined after
consultation with General Otis. It
would not be surprising were the de
partment to hear from General Otis be
fore the return of the President, so that
the latter may be supplied with neces
sary information in order to take im
mediate action.
"In any event," said the official with
wh./m I talked. "I wish it reiterated
I that there, is little probability of a for
mal call for volunteers. Stat<- organiza
tions will not be accepted, although
there are many applications on file from
them for muster in and dispatch to the
Philippines. Th'; President will, 1
think, authorize the department to di
' rect its recruiting officers to make en
i llstments, and I n:n confident the mi n
i can be obtained In such numbers as iÂ«
I form complete organizations and be
.; ready for service with General Otis
. during the fall months."
Should the President authorize the
formation of ten regiments, recruiting
officers would have to obtain 15.700 men
to mi them. At least 4000 men will be
required for the three volunteer organi
zations which General Otis has author
ity to organize, .making 20,000 of the
000 men of the provisional army eiilist
ment which is authorized by law.
Administration officials not connected
with th" War Department with whom l
talk-d to-day are hopeful that th"
President, when he determines to au
thorize the department to enlist more
men. will direct that the entire 35,000
be enlisted. The moral effect of such
action, they say. would be excellent.
Pr.-ss dispatches from Manila showing
that the Filipino papers have been
printing announcements of the with
drawal of the volunteers and that the
rebels have been much encouraged in
Consequence, believing such withdrawal
means the beginning of the exodus of
American troops, have i n anticipated
by the officials, who believed Aguii
would find in the return of the volun
teers an additional argumeni for a con
tinuan f the war. The news, which
will undoubtedly be promptly cabled to
Hongkongj and thence transmitted to
th>- Filipino leaders, of the determina
tion of the President to semi 35.000 more
troops to General Otis, making 60,000
soldiers under his command, will do
to convince the native officials
of the purpose of this Government to
restore peace and order in the islands
than anything else that might be done.
For this reason the President will be
urged upon his return t" direct the In
crease of the army to the 100,000 men
authorized by the army reorganization
law.
WHY ARGUELLES WAS
PUNISHED BY FILIPINOS
MANILA, June 22. 7:30 p. m. â Details
1 of the sentencing of Colonel Arguelles,
j a Filipino commissioner, to twelve
! years' imprisonment, have just been
Ined her... it was first reported
that his condemnation by the Filipinos
was due to the friendship he displayed
toward Americans, but the Information
'just received shows the accusation
; against him was not based on his peace
1 conferences at Manila, as supposed.
Th'-y confirm President Schurman'a be
: lief in his sincerity and show that his
advocacy of autonomy among the In
surgents was treat". l as treason. Th"
charge against the colonel was that in
conversation with Filipino officers he
predicted that disorders within the in
surgent territory would lead to civil
war, and therefore, he said, he con
sidered autonomy under the Americans
preferable to independence. The Fili
pino congress tried him on the charge
j of treason and a heated debate over
autonomy followed. Finally the colonel
whs sentenced to death, but this was
commuted to twelve years' Imprison
â  ment on account of his previous ser
vices to the cause, after an eloquent
pl^a on the part of his counsel.
Colonel Arguelles is one of the most
conservative and respected men identi
fied "ith the insurrection. The rebels
have learned that "the American volun
teers are returning to the T*nit"<l stat"s,
and the Filipino newspapers show that
they construe this to mean that the
Americans are abandoning the war,
and ai ncouraged thereby.
The outposts of the Washington
Regiment yesterday captured General
pjo dei piiar's brass band of eighty
two piecs. the members of which
Bomehow became separated from th"
rebel army and came near the Ameri
can lines without having the means of
resistance. Some Chinamen of .Manila
have filed a claim against the instru
ments, which, it appears, were leased
by the musicians of General Pio del
Pilar.
Four of tho wounded of the Fourth
Infantry in the recent fight with the
rebels have died in hospitals.

DEWEY IS
WELCOMED
AT COLOMBO
Received by Representative
Englishmen and Present
ed With a Casket.
Special Dispatch to Th<Â» Call.
COLOMBO, Ceylon, June 22.â The
United States cruiser Olympia, with
Admiral Dewey on board, arrived here
at 6 o'clock this morning from sin^<>
pore, saluted the forts ashore and was
saluted by the latter in return.
An aid-de-camp, representing the
Governor of Ceylon, Hon. Sir Joseph
Westridgeway, boarded the Olympia at
7 o'clock this morning in order to wel
come Admiral Dewey, and Colonel Sav
age, commanding the troops, made a
visit at 10 o'clock. The visits were re
turned at 11 o'clock. He was met at
the jetti.s by a guard of honor and
amid cheering drove jn the Governor's
carriage to breakfast with Colonel Sav
age. The admiral afterward 1 k"d
rooms at the Galloface Hotel, and re
turned on board the Olympia at 1
o'clock. There he received a deputa
tion representing the Planters' Asso
ciation and the chamber of Commerce
and was presented with a silver casket
and an address as a memento of his
visit.
The presentation of the casket to
Admiral Dewey was made on board of
the Olympia instead of In the Council
chamber, because his doctor had for
bidden him to participate in any func
tion. The delegates also presented a
thousand pounds of tea to the crew of
the Olympia. The Admiral, replying to
the address of welcome said he wished
he could reply in adequate terms, re
ciprocating the sentiments expressed.
But, he added, he spoke from his heart
v. h-n he said he deeply appreciated the
welcome.
Admiral Dewey added that h" would
have the very acceptable present of tea
distributed as desired, incidentally
mentioning that he was a life-long tea
drinker himself, and assuring the com
mittee that the address would be read
at "muster" and afterwards framed
and preserved. The casket, he re
marked, Vie would always keep on his
table, and he told the delegates that he
would report the matter to his Govern
ment and describe the cordiality of his
reception. Continuing, Admiral Dewey
remarked:
"That cheer raised on the Jetty when
I landed went to the hearts of all of
us. We are 14,000 miles from home,
but that cheer will be heard in Amer-
Ica, although the way in which it has
touched me 1 shall never be able to fully
express. The two nations were never
so closely allied by mutual sympathy
and appreciation as now. The Ameri
can peoph realized this during the late
war and you can imagine how all those
who were at Manila and met Sir Ed
ward Chichester (commander of tho
Ilritish first-Class cruiser Immortalite)
and his gallant comrades hold that feel
ing very deeply."
A general conversation followed and
after toasting the "Anglo-Saxon Union"
and the prosperity of the two countries
the delegation departed.
Admiral Dewey now says it is im
probable that he will go to Kandy and
that he intends staying in Colombo.
The admiral will remain in Ceylon
about a week. He says he had a good
voyage from Singapore and that his
health Is fairly good.

ONE AMERICAN
DEMAND OPPOSED
Protection of Private
Property at Sea.
QUESTION MAY BE OMITTED
COMMITTEES CONSIDER THE USE
OF EXPLOSIVES.
Peace Conference in Favor of Prohib
iting the Use of Certain Deadly-
Bullets and Explosives
From Balloons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE, June 22.â The American
demand for the protection of private
property at sea has not yet been present
ed to the Peace Conference. Andrew D.
White, bead of the American delegation,
on Tuesday requested the president of the
conference, M. dÂ»- Btaal, to submit the
question to the conference, at the same
time suggesting that the proper way to
brinp the matter up for discussion would
be to assi mble a plenary conference, sub
mit the Question and nave it referred to a
commission for examination. M. de
Staal has not yel arrived at a decision,
as the American proposal has not been
translated into French.
It is 1 1 < Â» - genera) opinion that the dole-
Kates of the gr^at powers are absolutely
opposed to raising the Question, arguing
the incompetence of the conference to do
so under the terms of Count Muravieff's
circular, M. de Staal having declared at
the opening of the conference, with the
approval of the delegates, that under no
circumstances would the conference dis
cuss any question not contained in the
circular.
Several delegates declare there is little
chance of the question being discussed,
but that if it is discussed America will
be opposed with the utmost energy by
Great Britain and all the powers.
After short sessions of the sub-com
mit t<>s of war and navy, at which re
ports by Major General Den Der Portu
gael of the Dutch delegation and Count
Soltyk, the Austrian naval expert, were
respectively adopted, the first committee
met to discuss the same in the above
order. The delegates declared in favor of
any state using any explosives or new
inventions for ordnance, Russian and
Bulgaria alone refraining from voting.
The question of dumdum bullets w;iÂ«
discussed. Major Sir John Ardagh of the
British delegation declared that Great
Britain did not desire to use any projectile
inconsistent with the principles of modern
warfare and that dumdums should only
be used against an uncivilized foe.
The conference finally resolved in favor
of prohibiting the use of bullets which
s[ire;id and flatten out in the human body,
such as explosive bullets, bullets in a
hardened case which does not entirely
cover the point or bullets without an
Incision. The Hritish and American dele
gates alone voted in the negative.
The use of any new explosive in pro
jectiles from balloons was prohibited for
live years, The question of restraining 1 the
Introduction of new types of ritles was
referred.
Count Soityk's report was then taken
up. It declared that the sub-committee,
though unable to agree regarding the pro
posed abolition of naval rams, submarine
torpedo boats and the use of explosives,
had declared against the use of asphyx
iating gases, which the first committee
also approved. â¢*
A number of delegates are suffering
from a. mild form of malaria caused by
the emanations from the canals which
receive the sewage. Mrs. Holls, wife of
Frederick Hoiis. secretary of the Ameri
can delegation, has been obliged to go to
Dusseldorf for a change of air.
STRANGE HUMANITARIAN
IDEAS OF PEACE DELEGATES
LONDON, June 23.â The correspondent
of the Times at The Hague says: This
has been one of the most exciting days of
the conference. There was a .sharp con
troversy between the Russian and Ameri
can naval delegates. Captain Mahan very
pertinently asked why the employment of
gases should i.o Interdicted, while the
more cruel wholesale dtsiruction of life
aimed at by the employment of submarine
boats should bo permitted.
"A shell charged with asphyxiating pas
need not necessarily destroy human life,"
ho said, "any more than chloroform, but
might only place men hors dv combat for
a time, .whereas a submarine boat,
stealthily approaching under cover of
darkness, might send a thousand sleeping
nun to a watery grave. Why forbid re
tail asphyxiation by air and permit whole -
sale asphyxiation by water "
A Russian delegate replied that the men
might be picked up when the ship sank.
Captain Mahan retorted by recalling the
case of the British battleship Victoria,
where, as he pointed out in a highly dis
ciplined fleet, in broad daylight and
smooth waters, many hundreds of men
were drowned, so sudden was the satas
trophe and short the available time to
pick up the men. He reminded the com
mission also that this happened when an
immense Beet was close together and in
tent on doing its utmost to save life.
Captain Ma ban's arguments were alto
gether logical and unassailable, but this
did not prevent the commission voting
them down. A suggestion that seemed to
be made quite seriously was put forward
by one delegate to the effect that a sub
marine boat would naturally do her best
to save life after she had sent the ship to
the bottom.
In the discussion regarding- dumdum
bullets the Russian delegate. Colonel Jil
inski, did not mince matters, but plainly
expressed the opinion that the dumdum
was uselessly cruel. He refused to accept
the humanitarian amendment proposed by
Captain Crozlex of the American delega
tion, which would have been voted unani
mously, that no bullets should be adopted
which caused unnecessary suffering 1 .
Although it must bo obvious to ail that
giving a specific technical interdiction to
certain features will not prevent the in
troduction of other features capable of
f>roduclng more cruel results, this is iike
y to be the case.
Indeed, an ingenious and simple means
of evading the Russian interdiction has
already been devised. "What a strange
commentary on a humanitarian confer
ence that one of its results may very well
be the Introduction of a more cruel mis
sile than any at present in use.
When the vote was taken Great Britain
and America were left in the minority.
England and the United States, therefore,
are branded by the majority as uncivil
ized and anti-humanitarian states, while
the Russians are to be congratulated on
having served the cause of civilization
and humanity. At least, the eccentri
cities of to-day's debate have almost put
matters in that absurd light.
YOUNG TURKS NOW
WORRY THE SULTAN
LONDON, June 23.â The correspondent
of the Daily News at The Hague de
scribes the "great effort the Sultan Is
making to Induce the Dutch Government
to suppress the meetings of the Young
Turkish party." He says: "A meeting
was announced and it was given out that
the speakers were to be Achmed Riza Bey
Ammeghian. an Armenian, and Bcwa
kowski, an Austrian Pole. The Govern
ment summoned the speakers to prove
their possession of financial resources,
the absence of which would be the only
ground upon which their expulsion could
be decreed.
This shabby trick failed and the meet
ing was held; but it had an extraordinary
result. Turkhan Pasha, the first dele
gate of Turkey, sent his secretary, Rechid
Bey, to challenge the young Turkish
leader to a duel. Rizar replied that they
were both guests of a country where
dueling was unlawful and that he would
not help the tirst Turkish delegate to
commit a crime. Of course, the Sultan is
behind this, and his Chief of Police is
coming here to look after the young
Turks.
The German delegates are still without
instructions on the arbitration question.

WASHINGTON. June 22. â Admiral
Kantz reported his arrival at San Fran
cisco last evening hy telegraph to the
Navy Department, but made no report,
upon Samoan affairs. This probably will
be committed to the mails. His official
superiors are fully satisfied with his con
duct while at Apia. The admiral retains
his assignment as commander-in-chief of
the forces on the Pacific station and the
Philadelphia will be retained in commis
sion, though necessary repairs and dock-
Ing will be made ai once.
There is a disposition in all diplomatic
quarti rs concerned in Samoa to ai pt
the action of the High Commissioners as
satisfactory, mainly because thp commis
sion has been on the ground, has heard
all evidence and is presumably best able
to determine the means of adjusting ;h>
many conflicting interests.
The British Foreign Office lias forward
ed to Mr. Tower, the British charge here,
a statement of the conclusions reached
by the Samoan Commission, Including in
part the t.-xt of thÂ«Â» proclamation abol
ishing the kingship and establishing the
provisional government, it states:
The commission published a procla
mation on June 10. reciting whereas the
declaration uf the Chief Justice declaring
Malietoa as King is considered by the
High Commission as valid and binding.
whereas, The said Malietoa has volun
tarily tendered his resignation as King,
and the samÂ« has been duly accepted;
and whereas, the High Commission has
decided to abolish the office of King in
Samoa.
Proclamation is made for the establish
ment of a provisional government during
the stay of the High Commisison in Sa

STOCKTON, June 22.â The steamer
< ':* pt :iin Weber came in this morning with
a break in one of her boilers, through
which steam was escaping. It extended
alongside a line of rivets. The danger
was not known until the steamer was
finite near port, and every precaution was
at once taken to prevent serious conse
quences. The passengers knew nothing
of the accident, as it was not deemed
necessary to create any alarm, although
the consequences might have been terrible
but for the timely discovery and prompt
action. The Union Transportation Com
pany's officers took no chances and they
at once announced the boat would not
leave port to-night. The boiler-rooms
were turned over to machinists. The steel
around the crank was cut away and new
Steel parts are being riveted" in. The
W( ber will be out in a day or two and
before Bhe resumes her runs' the company
will have the machinery thoroughly In
spected. The boilers are compartively
new and the break must have been thÂ«
result of a flaw. The "Weber is one of the
best boats in the river service, and the
delay at this busy season involves con
siderable loss to the company.

was to-day put In the position of alter
native choice of the American Institute
of Homeopathy for the place of holding
the institute's flfty-Bixth annual conven
tion in 1900. The committee having the
matter in charee recommended that the
meeting be held in Washington at the
time of the unveiling of the monument to
Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy,
and In case of circumstance? arising
which misrht prevent the unveiling that
thÂ» meeting be held In Put-In-Bay, Ohio.
It was shown, however, that $33,000
must be raised, and an act of Congress
passed giving the site for a monument,
before it can be raised at the capital This
makes It very doubtful if the monument
can ho unveiled a year hence, and the
committee's report would, If adopted,
probably send the convention to Pul-ln-
Bay. It was amended, howevr. by
substituting Cleveland for Put-in-Bay,
and it la probable that the convention #111

MRS. SPRING TO
GET A DIVORCE
And the Custody of the
Three Children.
JUDGE LORIGAN SO SAYS
DEFENDANT DECLABES HE IS
PENNILESS.
But the Wife Avers He Is Worth
$50,000, and Demands a Share
of Community Property
and Big Alimony.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. June 22.â Mrs. Emilie T.
Spring will receive a divorce from her
husband, H. M. N. Spring, and the cus
tody of three small children, also a goodly
share of her husband's property, which is
estimated to be worth over $50,000. JudÂ«e
Lorigan said as much to-day when the
caso was submitted to him for decision.
The Spring divorce suit ended rather
abruptly this afternoon. Considerable In
terest centered in the proceedings be
cause of the prominence of both parties.
and the fact that it was heard behind
closed doors added additional Interest. Tt
was expected it would take a sensational
turn, but it proved to be the dullest case
ever tried with locked doors.
Sprlns was charged with infidelity, two
MlMes Bahr of San Francisco being co
respondents. The names of these young
ladies who â  ined Spring's affection
from his wife were not. mentioned. De
tectives, however, proved the Council
man's unfaithfulness and told of the dual
life he led.
Spring was the first witness to-day and
the sole one for the defense. He was not
questioned about the charge made. Prop
erty interests were gone into, a poor
mouth was put on and he stated his busi
ness did not amount to much and almost
admitted he was penniless. He said he
would support one of three children, and
Intimated lit- would IP-- the custody of
.Tank, a hoy of seven.
Mrs. Spring followed her hasbrâ i. She
reiterated the statement of Spring being
worth 000. find also that she wanted
the children. The boy she intended to ed
ucate at Santa Clara College.
The matter was then submitted without
argument to Judge I. origan, and he took
it under advisement. He said Mrs. Spring
was entitled to a divorce and would have
the custody of the children. He would
consider the property interests. There
was vast difference hetween being nenni
loss and having $50,000. and he would en
deavor to strike a fair average. The own
ership of the furniture would also be de
cided when he rendered his opinion.
The general Impression is that Mrs.
Spring Will receive the pretty home at San
Antonio and Seventh streets. $200 a month
alimony and half of the community prop
erty.
Mrs. Spring is very nronvnent in upper
society circles, nnd Snring conducts a
large clothing ?,tore nnd Is a Councilman.
ThÂ« defend is also very prominent in
or> ur oin circles and keeps a fine pack of
hounds Tt < = to dogs, wine and women
that Mrs. Snrlng attributes the breaking
up of her home.

VIII 1111 Â£11 IllUkllVUllblll Ccr. Spring and Second, Los Angelei. NEVER SOLD IN DRUG STORES-
CARNEGIE GETS
A BIG CONTRACT
Steel Rails for Russian
Government.
AN ORDER WORTH MILLIONS
â Â« â .
TO BE USED ON THE SIBERIAN
ROADS.
There Has Been Nothing Like It
Ever Known in the Steel
Trade in This
Countiy.
Special r>isr' > -t'"h *to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 22.â The New
York Commercial, financial and Wall
street journal, this morning prints the
following::
riTTSnrRO. June 22.â The Carnegie
Step] Company has signed a contract with
the Russian Government for the largest
order of steel ever given In the history
of the world. It has :i double significance,
being as it- is for export. Further, it '
means that the Carnegie Steel Company's
advantages for manufacturing have never
been even partially realized and also that
greater things can be looked for from this
country than foreigners ever dreamed of.
The Carnegie Company has agreed to i
deliver to the Russian Government within
the next twenty-six months 180.000 ton?:
of steel rails at a price said to ho ' the
highest rpidted this year. Tt Is paid the
sale was made at $2S per ton. but this is ,
not authentic. Tt is safe to say the price
is not less than $25 per ton at the mill.
Such being the case, the Carnegie Steel
Company lias an order aggregating $4.- !
500.000, which has never been surpassed '
in the history of the steel trade. Tt could
not be learned who represented the RUB- j
sian Government in the deal, nor was it â 
made clear Just when the first deliveries !
will )>e made. Tht> rails are for exten- '
sive railroad projects the Russian Gov- !
ornment is j. nan. nine: in Siberia and I
China.
Taking the eighty-pound rail as the \
standard, it means that the Carnegie .
Company will supply about isnn miles of
railroad, although it is doubtful if such |
heavy rails will be used for this traffic,
as the sixty-pound rail is usually used
in building new railroads.
The fr-st news of this important steel
ra^l contract was learned to-day by a
representative of the Commercial in ;
this city, and our Pittsburg corres
pondent was asked to confirm it, which
he did, up above. The order was nego- j
tiit' n !n Philadelphia, where the trans
action was completed to-day, through I
A. A. Kasheonikoflf. who represented j
thp Russian 'Invprnment. and who is !
also one of tlv chief engineers of the I
Siberian Railroad. The contract price'
is learned authoritatively by the loral
representative, and is ?2S per ton. free '
on board at Pittsburg. This means that
the total value of the contract will
amount to no less a sum than $5,040,000.
STRIKERS REJECT THE
PROPOSED COMPROMISE
Cleveland Street Car Men Will Stay
Out Sooner Than Accept the
Terms Offered.
CLEVELAND, June 22.â The hope of a
settlement of the street railway strike
was shattered to-night, when the strik
ers at a meeting rejected by a unanimous
vote the propositions submitted by the
company to the special committee of the
City Council and to which the strikers'
committee agreed this afternoon.
The proposition of the company states
that It is ready and willing to take back
Into Its employment such of its employes
as its business demands, aggregating at
the present time SO per cent of such em- i
ployes, excepting always those that have j
committed unlawful acts against the com
pany, its property or employes during the
present strike. It was generally believed
after the conference of the representa
tives of the company and the committee
of the strikers was concluded that the end i
of the strike would come to-morrow morn
ing, and the action of the strikers to- j
night came as a surprise.
NAVY DEPARTMENT

Maryland officer. In anticipation of this,

Various Sizes.
KppclÃl niÂ«-it<-h to Thp Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 22.âAcquaint
ances of C. A. Peer, the erstwhile Beau
Brummel of the mining fraternity,
woulii like to see him once more. Peer
registered at the Van Nuya several
weeks ago. and gave out the informa
tion that he was owner of the Black
Eagle mine at Lytle Creek, which
would begin operation? about the mid
dle of July.
Peer is a man 40 years of acre, dresses
well, wears a dark heard and seems to
be refined. He worked into the tc< *
graces of a number of nice people. Th*
first intimation of his peculiarity of
character was obtained when h< tried
to borrow money from the bell boys at
the hotel.
He remained a week at the Van
Nuys; then he paid his hill and 1> ft.
On June 3 Peer called upon Joseph
Melczer, a liquor denier, and pot cash
for a $20 check on the Fanners' and
Merchants' Bank. Peer represented
himself as a rich man, and said that hfi
did not know that the banks closed
early on Saturdays. On the following
Monday Melczer presented the check at
the hank and was told that Peer was
known there, but that he never had
deposited any money in that bank.
Peer called on Attorney Tom Neal ami
offered to buy Neal'S handsome home
at 2400 South Flower Street for $29.0nn.
At Barker Brothers' he ordered furni
ture and at Cass & Smurr's sto- c hou*<Â»
he ordered kitchen utensils. As the
poods were not called for the orders
were canceled after a few days. It is
said that when Peer left orders for
poods he tried to borrow money and in
several places was successful.
Tie has not been seen in tmvn since
then. Peor had evidently intended to
furnish the Xeal house in elaborate
style for Barker Brothers say his bill
at* their place came to $700 or $WO.
When Peer tried to borrow $20 from the
firm suspicion was arousr-d and the or
der for the sronds was canceled. The
furniture dealers have not heard from
the mysterious Peer since the day he
ordered his handsome unholstery.
MANUFACTURERS' DISPUTE
RETARDS THE FARMERS
An Injunction on the UiÂ»e of Harvest
ers That Interferes With
Operations.
WOODLAND. June 22. â war between
Stockton manufacturers of combined har
vesters seems likely to subject many Sac
ramento Valley farmers to a great deal
of annoyance and some expense. Quite a
number of the Hain*Â»*-Hou.ser harvesters
have been sold in Tolo .and adjoining
counties this season. The Holt Bros., a
rival manufacturing establishment in
Stonkton. claims that thÂ»>ro are certain
devices used on the Haines-Houser ma
chine for â¢which the Holt Company holds
patents. Farmers purchased these ma
chines in good faith and without any
knowledge that Holt Bros, had set up a
claim of infringement of patent. It seems
like a hardship and an unnecessary an
noyance to delay harvesting operations at
such a critical stage, especially when th-i
farmers are nrt the responsible parties, it
there has really ' <?en any infringement.
On Wednesday Deputy United States
Marshal J. A. Littlefield came up from
San Francisco and served an injunction,
upon W. W. Nelson, directing him to ap
pear in the United States Circuit Court In
San Francisco and show cause, if any,
Why he should not be restrained from us
ing a Haines-Houser harvester.
All other Yolo County purchasers have
received a letter from Holt Bros.' attor
ney, in which the demand is made that
they immediately desist from the use of
Haines-Houser machines and at < nee ac
count to Holt Bros, for all gains, dam
ages, profits or advantages to which they
may be entitle! by reason of an infringe
ment of patent. They are threatened with
a suit unless they immediately comply
with the demand.

RUHLIN RULES
THE FAVORITE
AT ONE TO TWO
The Big Boxer Has
Many Supporters.
KENNEDY, TOO, HAS FRIENDS
! LIVELY WAGERING EXPECTED
TO-DAY ON THEIR BOUT.
Jack Stelzner Challenges the Winner
for a Meeting Under Similar
Conditions â Billy Otts
and Charley Tye.
(;\:s Ruhlin and Joe Kennedy will mÂ«ei
at Woodward's Pavilion to-night before
1 the Excelsior Athletic Club in a boxing
i â¢ scheduled to go twenty rounds. As
both are big, husky 230-pounders they
should provide an exhibition such as the
, lovers of boxing in this city would go
miles to see". The press of money hot on
Ruhlin in Co.rbett'3 ,'esterday made him
favorite at odds of ' to 2.
This is such a tempting short end ii is
expected a lot of money will be forth
coming tn be placed on Kennedy before '
the two men enter the ring. The Califor
nian's friend believe he has an excellent )
chance and expert him to bring down his '
big opponent. Both men have trained as
carefully for their meeting as though it |
were a championship battle. Ruhlin ha* j
had a shade the host of it in this respect.
as he was in condition when he arrived
here and needed bot gentle exercise t<> tit
him for his engagement. He has taken !
care not to overtrain.
From the day the match was made
Kennedy has been unremitting In his
preparation. He has made his headquar
ters at the Ocean Beach, and has done his
outdoor work on the park drives, devoting
much of his time to sprinting. His in
door practice lias been varied, including ;
punching the bag, wrestling ant] boxing.
In the latter he has had tne advantage of
boxing with Spider Kelly, who is exceed- j
Ingly clever with the gloves. Kennedy is
tired with ambition and has set his heart
on winning this light. He has a repula-- j
tion for gameness, and. being a good |
boxer, is expected to make a determined
stand against the Easterner.
There is a general casting about for :
championship material, and if this is a
decisive fight the winner will be among I
the candidates whose claims will be con
sidered. He neÂ»d not look far for i :
match, as "Jack'" Stelznor has challenge 1
the victor, and Tom Sharkey might meet
him if sufficient inducements were held
out to him. Madden does not like to have
his protege Idle, so there would oe n i
difficulty in securing a match with Ruh
lin.
The preliminary bout to-night will be
between Otts and Tye. OttÂ« is favorite at
10 to >>. having won his recent fights In i
decisive manner.
Martin Julian wired Jack Stelzner yes
terday asking him if he would accept .i
match in the Bast. No hint was given
as to the man whom Fitzsimmons' man
ager had in view. Stelzner has the mat
ter under consideration.
DENTISTS SANDWICH A
LUNCH WITH MEETINGS
THIRD DAY OF THE CONVEN
TION BRINGS A CHANGE.
In Executive Session the Younger
Case Is Considered and Officers
Elected for the Eollow
ing Year.
The third day of the convention of the I
California State Dental Association intro- j
duced two new features into procedure.
The morning and evening were devoted to
clinical demonstration by means of lan
tern slides; the afternoon was given ever j
to a lunch at thf Cliff House, where some
seventy-five dentists sat down to an ex
tended feast and listened to a dozen or.
more speeches in which teeth did not
figure.
The scientific labor? of the day were
confined to clinics. The following was
: the programme: "Cataphort?sis> and Kooi.
| Canal Filling," by S. L. Strickland of San
â  Francisco; "Ambidexterous Operating,"

i tion of the Use of New and Simple Hoot
| Canal Dryer," by Prank C. Pague of San
Francisco; "Treatment of Pyorrhoea
Alveolaris," by Rusael Hopkins <?00l of
San Francisco: "Administration of Chlor
oform by Means of an Inhaler, Admitting
Atmospheric Air," by C. Deiohmiller of
. San Francisco.
The last paper of the evening was read
by Dr. A. '. Hart, who demonstrated his
problems by lantern slide projections.
His subject was "Embryology and Path
] ology." Many eulogistic speeches were
made upon Dr. Hart's work by members
'of the association. The illustrations and
the accompanying explanations seemed to
strike Dr. Cool very forcibly, for the lat
ter offered to head a subscription for the
! furthering of such .scientific- Investigation
as Dr. Hart had made and disclosed.
In the afternoon, just as the black cof
fee was being served. President Metcalf.
as toastmastf>r, inaugurated a season of
table talk. The following toasts were
given:
â â¢Social Influence." by Dr. L.. Van Or
! den; "The California State Dental Asso
i ciation," by Dr. W. F. Lewis; "Fish
Stories." by Dr. F. L. Platt: "Absent
Ones.'; by Dr. S. E. Knowies; "Past Pres
idents," by Dr. Russel Hopkins Cool;
I "Sweethearts and Wives," by Dr. M.
1 Meek, and "The Bachelors," by Dr. Hen
i dricks.
! The evening's procedure was closed by
; the association going in to executive sef
! sion for the election of officers. The fol
| lowing are the new officers:
Walter F. Lewis of Oakland, president; A.F.
Merrlman, first vice president: A. M- .Barker
of San Jose, srenn/i vice president; T. I>.
Platt, third vice president; R. W. Me<*k of
Oakland, corresponding secretary; C. It.' In(?le
hardt, treasurer, and W. Z. King, recording
secretary.
When in executive session the r;tso of
Dr. \v. J. younger, who is now In Chi
cago, was considered. After much wrang
ling he was maile an honorary member
of the association. The next annual meet-
Ing of the Pacific Coast Dental Associa
tion will be held in this city.

kindred bodies. These organizations reach all classes of trade and ave

With proper committees appointed from each body, the matter will

year or two between fights, nor ask his
opponents to 'get reputations' by whip
ping other pugilists, lie stands ready to
defend the championship against all
comers, and only asks reasonable time in
which to get into proper condition."

RICHARD HENRY SAVAGE.
Ho Asks tc Be Commissioned Briga
dier General â Ready for Ser
vice at the Front.

ice in suppressing the insurrection in the

USED A PENKNIFE.
Frank Trainor, Aged 12 Years, Stab
bed Twice by Another Boy.
Frank Trainor. aged 12 years, was
stabbed in the back and left side yester
day afternoon by another boy named Jo
seph Derites. The latter was arrested by
Police Officers Tracey and Ross and
charged with assault to commit murder.
Trainor's wounds, which are not seri
ous, were dressed at the Receiving Hos
pital by Police Surgeon Well.
Both Trainor and his assailant are
newsboys. -Yesterday afternoon they met
in front of the Palace Hotel and engaged
in a heated dispute. Getting the worst
of the argument. Trainor armed himself
with a piece of wood and started out with
the avowed determination of annihilating
Derites. The latter, divining his inten
tion, took out a penknife and prepared to

raised the piece of wood to strike Derites
plunged the blade of the knifo into his
side. With a cry of pain young Trainor
started to run away, when Derites again
raised the kjilfe and stabbed him in the
back.

RAILROAD IS
COME TOGETHER
TO ORGANIZE
Speculate on How to
Increase Traffic.
A meeting was held in Wells. Fargo &
Oo.'s building yesterday morning, which
was attended by all the local representa
tives of the transcontinental passenger
lines. The object of the gathering was to
form a local or-ranization of railroad pas
senger agents for the purpose of protect
ing, facilitating and furthering the rail
road interests of the State. Such organi
zations have for a long time been estab
lished in all the leading railroad centers
of the South and East and have resulted
in much good, not only to the railroad
representatives who compose them, but
for the people at large, who derive much
benefit in various ways from the business
brought by the increased travel which is
the natural consequence of such united
action.
The meeting yesterday was attended by
i>ver twenty-five local representatives of
different transcontinental roads, who
gathered together in response to a cull
from E. v. McCormlck, passenger traf
fic manager of the Southern Pacific. Mr.
McCormiek called the meeting to order,
after which F. A. Countiss, representative
of the Transcontinental Freight Bureau,
was chosen chairman. Mr. McCormick ad
dressed the meeting, setting: forth the ne
cessity of some such an organization.
which would systematize the passenger
business, do away with rate cutting and
kindred evils, protect the agents and the
people of the ('oast generally and brin^
through legitimate business methods the
proportion of traffic to California which
should rightfully come this way.
After Mr. McCormiek had concluded a
committee of seven was appointed to
draft regulations and by-laws for the gov
ernment of the association, after which
came a. little informal discussion on mat
ters <>f general interest, concluding with
an adjournment until 10 o'clock next
Tuesday morning.
The following roads are represented on
the committee: Union Pacific. Southern
Pacific, Santa Fe, Rio Grande Western.
Burlington. Texas and Paciiic and Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company.
Some time ago a telegram was received
in this city which stated that the I nion
Pacific. Southern Pacific arid Santa Fe
roads had notified their Eastern connec
tions that they would refuse to honor Na
tional Educational Association tickets
where the issuing line failed to add the
additional $5 via the Ogden route, where
the passenger elected to come out via
Ogden and Los Angeles, returning to his
home by way of Shasta and Portland.
Mr. McCormiek when seen in regard to
this telegram branded it as false in every
particular. â¢ ,â,,,,,
"Our conductors," said Mr. Mc< ormick.
"will honor these tickets wherever and
whenever they are presented. As far as
the five-dollar matter is concerned, we
think the Eastern roads should absorb it
and wo imagine they will. Hut. however
that may be, the matter is one w T hich is
strictly between the railroad companies
and in" which the passenger will not figure
vi any way. When he buys his ticket he
need have" no fear of being asked for an
additional $i> or 5 cents."
"The Southern Pacific and Santa Fe
have made a one-way fare of $62 50 from
Chicago to Los Angeles, and the only ad
dition" to that will be the $2 collected for
the Educational Association fund and
which will go not to the railroad's pock
ets, but to defray the expenses of the
association in paying its lecturers, etc.
You can say that the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe are trying their best not
only to do what is right by the people
of this State in the matter of the Edu
cational Association, but are also doing
all in their pow^r to secure the next Ep
worth League convention for this coast.
and will guarantee reduced rates right
through from Chicago to Pacific tide
water, no matter what action the other*
roads may take."

MAY BE ASSESSED.
Bonds Held by ancillary Executors
Are Liable.
City and County Attorney Lane haa
tiled an opinion with Assessor Dodge rela
tive to the liability of bonds held outside
the State by ancillary executors of an es
tate, which is in the Probate Court in
this city, to assessment, such bonds never
having been in this State. Attorney Lane
says:
i The general rule is that personal property of
i decedent* is taxed at the domicile of the de
cedent. An elaborate review of the authorities
! upholding this principle is given in the casp
><( San Francisco vs. Lax, M Cal., 481, whlc-li
rase has beeri accepted as final and determina
tive ..f th<> questli :i in this State. Vnles? the
taking out of ancillary letters in New York
: in some way affects the operation of this rule>
: it must therefore govern in the case before
â  you, as in others.
Ancillary administration is, as the words In
dicate, Â«n administration subordinate and aux
illiary to the original administration. Ancil
j lary administrators do not displace nor super-
I sede executors to whom letters were issued at
i the domicile of the decedent. The purpose of
| ancillary administration is to Rather and pre
â¢ serve the estat" of the decedent in some juris
dlctlon other than that where the original let
ters issued. And it is quite common for an
! ciliary letters to "ne taken out by an executor
who poes into the foreign jurisdiction for that
j purpose. It cannot be. therefore, that ancillary
! administration having been taken out in New
York changes the effect ot the general rulf.
â  and I advise that such bonds held in New York
by an ancillary administrator should be taxod
: in this Statp BO lons us th<* estate remains In
! probate.
FOR THE COMFORT
OF OUR SOLDIERS
GENERAL STERNBERG TO PLAN
THE MODEL CAMP.
He Will Also Make a Thorough In
spection of All Pertaining to
His Department.
Registered at the Palace Hotel is Gen
eral George M. Sternberg. surgeon general
of the army of the United States. Gen-
I eral Sternberg's stay in the city will be
| of several weeks' duration, during whicii
' time he will make a tour of inspection
which will embrace in its scope everything
! connected with the department of whicii
: he is the supreme head.
Not only will he give his attention to
! ordinary routine duties such as the in
spection of hospitals and other branches
i of the service pertaining to his depart
ment, but he will also see that the siitÂ»
chosen for the model camp which is to
| shelter our returning volunteers is prop
erly selected and that all of the camp's
(details are brought as near perfection as
I possible:
General Sternberg has just completed an
exhaustive research upon consumption
and the. best means of caring for those
of t'nele Sam's boys who have had the.
misfortune to lie troubled by that dread
disease. The results of his work will in
i all probability become tangible in the
I erection of a home for consumptives in
New Mexico, where the Government will
take care of those whose constitutions have
broken down under the weight of hardship
j and privation which falls to the lot of a
soldier.
NOT APT TO GET IT.
The Batemans Want More Time to
Complete Hall of Â«i istice.
Bateman Brothers, the contractors who
are supposed to be constructing the Hall
of Justice, are before the Supervisors
again with another request for an ex
tension of thirty days in which to com
plete their- contract. Their time limit
expires on July 1, and unless an extension
is granted them they are liable to $100 a
day forfeit for every day it takes to com
plete the work.
Supervisor Holland says that at the
rate Bateman Bros, are working on the
building it will not be finished for a year.
He is bitterly opposed to granting* any
further extension, and as there is $80,000
still due the contractors he is in favor of
instructing the architect to either hire
men. purchase the materials and finish
the work himself, or let a contract to
somebody else to complete the building.
City Attorney Lane has advised that
either course can be adopted under the
terms of the original contract.
Not o;ie iif the Supervisors seems to be
disposed to grant the Batcmans any fur
ther time.

THE COUNTY CLERK'S DEPUTIES.
ON its face the decision of the Supreme Court
â¢ erning the right of the County Clerk to
appoii t as many deputies as may be ne<
for the prompt and faithful discharge of the duties oi
ln> office a] â â¢' > hsfactory to all con
cerned as any thai could have been rendered had
Daniel him- to judgment.
The court decides that the County Clerk may ap
many deputies a? he deems necessary. that
tlit deputies thus appointed may enter upon their
rform such work as they may find to do,
finally, that the county i- not bound to pay any
deputies c I -â¢â  whose appointment is provided
nd whose salaries are fixed by the act ot Feb
ruary 13, 1880.
It w ill I under this decision the Clerk
retains his unlimited patronage, the deputies retain
ith all attendant honors and dignities,
ty rei â  Everybody ought
yet il . robable thai no one will
\-.- satisfied except the Justices themselves. The ex
â  cc â  :' their judgment and it- firm foundation in
with the absence of any higher court
t .entile- then, will doubtless afford them that com
- faction which springs from a consciousness
of duty well performed; but there will be howling
else .v lure.
What will it profit the County Clerk to retain his
extensive patronage if he have to pay for it out of his;
own : â  Whai satisfaction will the deputies de
rive from the pleasant offices it' there be no salary
attached? What comfort will the county obtain from,
a saving of money which may occasion delay, con
fusion and endless vexation in such important public,
work as that of the Clerk'- office?
It is evident we have reached another of those legal
tangles that seriously interfere with the administra
tion of growing municipalities. The act, which, ac
cording to the court, tixi'< the number of County
Clerk deputies authorized to draw salaries provided
by law. allows but twenty-nine such deputies, while
the present force numbers seventy-seven. Doubtless
the number at present employed is larger than it
should be, but it is fairly certain the work of the
Clcrk'^ office has increased so much since irtÃo that
it cannot now be adequately performed by the former
number of deputies. Thus we have a situation which
is by no mean- so satisfactory as appears on the face
of the decision.
iurse some way will be devised for overcoming
the difficulty, which threatens to interfere with the
public service, and it is reasonable to expect the
solution of the problem will not reopen a way for
further extravagance in the office. In the meantime
it will be noted that a new lesson has been given of
the evil effects of ill-considered legislation at Sacra
mento* Hardly a year passes in which the affairs
of some portion of the State arc not seriously incon
venienced by reason of a tangle in the statutes. We
need many things in California, but what we need
most is a. better set of legislators.
THE WORST FAKER YET.
Â£\ BOUT the worst taker that ever irritated pub-
I \ lie opinion in San Francisco is the self-styled
* preacher who, on the strength of his son's
reputation as a pugilist, lias conic to town announcing
that it any one will furnish him with a hall he will
preach the gospel a Â»d expound the teachings of the
Bible tree.
In the absence of any law by which such an offen^
against religion, decency and the right of free speech
can be prevented by the summary arrest of the faker,
the only recourse left to those who have respect for
all such things is to treat the offender not with that
silent contempt which has no effect on the impu
dent, but with such openly expressed indignation as
will deter any considerable number of thoughtless
or sensation-seeking people from giving him any en
c< luragement whatever.
There is a limit beyond which vociferous fakers
cannot go without becoming something like a nui
sance, and in this case the limit has been passed. One
need not have much reverence in bis make-up to feel
the offensiveness of the pretension that a prize
fighter's success in the ring was due to prayers to
God. Neither need one be very severe in his con- i
demnation of blatherskites generally to condemn a
preacher who seeks to win notoriety by such asser
tions.
There arc many persons in San Francisco who are
willing to encourage almost any kind of folly for the
sake of having a laugh, but it is to be hoped there
are few who will make a jest of such an offense as
this. We can stand pugs who set out to* elevate the !
stage, but we cannot stand the pug's parent who i
poses as a teacher of religion.
A TAX OF ONE DOLLAR.
NEXT to the equalization of an as^sment roll
which shall represent, as between taxpayers,
the true value in money of the real .and personal
property of this city, the most important duty de
volving upon the Supervisors during the next few
weeks will be the adoption of a revenue order fixing
the rate of local taxation for the fiscal year 1899-1900.
Tins function involves no momentous financial
problem. Reduced to its constituent particles it is
Merely a question of whether or not the Supervisors
shnii keep their pledges.
There have been Supervisors who solemnly prom
ised to fix a certain tax rate, but who, after listening
to the' harrowing demand of municipal officials, have
disregarded their pledges. But neither such Super
visors nor the officials who aided and abetted them
have ever emerged from the political oblivion into
which their dishonorable course precipitated them.
Nor have the people ever treated the political parties
responsible for such pledge-breakers with greater
consideration. Therefore, if there is an unwritten
political law in San Francisco which neither politi
cians nor parties are at liberty to violate, it is the law
that platform pledges must be kept at all hazards.
Justification for breaking them can only be found in
war. pestilence, the acts of God or the public enemy â
ruder which two latter heads may be grouped fire.
Hood and earthquake, and the machinations of the
devil himself.
These remarks are apropos because in a few weeks
the Supervisors will consider a tax levy for the fiscal j
year 1809-1900. Last summer both the local political
parties pledged their candidates to a tax limit of one ]
dollar, the pledge of the Republicans, who control the
presem; Board of Supervisors, having been $1 on each
$100 valuation on an assessment roll of $350,000,000.
Under this limit not more than $3,500,000 can be
raised by taxation in San Francisco for the ensuing
fiscal year. If the Supervisors levy a tax for a greater
amount than that they will have to abandon their
pledges and. like some of their predecessors embark j
upon the dark and forbidding sea of political oblivion. I
In order to observe this pledge, it should be re- |
marked, it will not be necessary to conduct the local .
government next year on S3. 500.000. The revenue
from other sources than taxation will easily amount
i" ?i .500.000. The deficit, for which an outside levy
may be made, will reach $300,000, and probably the
demands for interest, sinking funds and judgments
will aggregate $75,000. A saving will be effected in
gas rate- and in the expenditures of "county officers,"
who must now, under a recent decision of the Su
preme Court, trim their necessities to their appropria
tions. Hence the Supervisors may provide next year
for the expenditure of about $5,300,000 and yet keep
within their pledges.
Will this be done? We say unhesitatingly that it
should be done. Moreover, we declare with equal
certainty that unless it is done there will be a reckon
ing at the ballot-boxes in November from which the
politicians and place-hunters of all parties may well
shrink with horror. Two members of the Board of
Supervisors are Democrats. They, with three Repub
lican-, follow the lead of Mayor Phelan, but all are
pledged, including the Mayor himself, to a tax levy
of Si on $^50,000,000.
The tax levy i- not a political question, nor one
which should be made the subject of political capitali
zation. Therefore, the Mayor and Supervisors should
join hand- to maintain these pledges. If Mr. Phelan
contrives any scheme in connection with the tax levy
which shall have for its object the imposition of a
greater tax than $1. in order that he may, like Don
Quixote, provide himself with a windmill for th.< I
rical demolition, the taxpayers will penetrate the veil
of his motives and will hold him responsible. The
overpowering demand of the moment is a lon tax
rate. The dawn of a hopeful season of municipal
prosperity a ill be hastened by the redemption of
these pledges.
SAMOA'S NEW GOVERNMENT.
\\ ODERN man is distinguished from the man
/ \ of ancient day? mainly by his. ability to de
vice new systems of government and his
readiness to apply one to any people upon whom he
has authority to practice it. There is probably, at
this time, hardly a man in Europe or America who
has nut. in his mind a ready-made constitution which
he would like to see substituted for that now in
operation in any country on the globe, from the
United States to the kingdom of Swat.
It was a foregone conclusion that the three Com
missioners appointed to act for the United States,
Germany and Great Britain in the settlement of the
disturbances in Samoa would begin by devising a
new form of government. The report of yesterday,
bringing an account of an agreement among them
to that end, was therefore a surprise to nobody. It
would have been amazing if they hadn't.
For an understanding of the new constitution
agreed upon by the representatives of the powers it
must be remembered that the United States. Germany
and Great Britain, ea-ch and all. severally and unitedly,
are bound by the most solemn obligations to respect
the independence of Samoa, to protect it from the
aggression of other nations, to maintain the right of
the Samoans to choose their own king, and to guar
antee to the Samoan people the preservation of their
native form of self-government.
The Commissioners have undertaken to fulfill
these pledges in a peculiar manner. They agree that
Malietoa Tanu shall be recognized as king of the
islands, in accord with the decision of Judge Cham
bers. That agreement is a victory for the United
States and Great Britain, whose officials at Apia
had put Malietoa on the throne, despite the fact that
the natives had elected Mataafa. It is next agreed
that Malietoa shall immediately abdicate, which is a
victory for Germany, inasmuch as her Consul always
asserted that youth should not rule in Samoa.
Finally it iÂ« determined there shall be no king, and
that decision is a victory for everybody except the
Samoans and the aforesaid treaties.
Samoa's new constitution is a beautiful work of
statecraft. It provides for a government consisting
of a Governor, a Chief Justice, a Legislative Coun
cil, composed of one American, one German and one
Britisher, each of whom, in addition to being one
third of the Samoan Council, i* to be his country's
Consul, and a House of Representatives, to be chosen
by the natives.
The working of such a constitution is sure to be
interesting. As the Samoans hnvc always conducted
their parliamentary proceedings with clubs, the de
bates in the House can be counted on to be lively at
all times. As the Consuls of the three powers have
always been wrangling with one another over every
subject under the Samoan sun, from the Cocoanut
crop to the best means of saving souls, the proceed
ings of the Council will add a new vigor to those of
the House. As for the Governor and the Chief Jus
tice, they will have to act as umpire and referee, and
if not impeached by the Council or clubbed by the
House will doubtless perform their functions with
sufficient eclat to entitle them to their salaries.
For the present, at any rate, the Samoan muddle
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JTNE 23, 1899.
is over. The warships will depart from Apia. Peace
reigns, and a new nation has arisen to the dignity
of a constitutional government.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS.
AS is usual at this season of the year, reports
come from nearly all parts of the State of a
demand for workers for the fields, the orchards
and the vineyards, whose crops are now ripening
or are already ripe for the harvest. At the same time
the streets of the city show a large number of un
employed men, some of whom are genuinely seeking
for work, but many of whom are seeking only fof the
alms that will enable them to live in. idleness.
In an interview with a representative of The Call,
F. \V. Zeile. president of the Mercantile Trust 'Com
pany, has directed attention to the extent of the de
mand at this time for labor in the rural districts. He
has had opportunities to learn the situation from
land-owners in nearly all parts of the State, and re
ports they are complaining of a lack of help to get
in their crops. In the course of his interview he said:
"In the big valleys there is hay and grain to har
vest, and in the smaller valleys the orchardists are be
ginning to feel the necessity of having a few addi
tional men to help handle the fruit crop. From what
1 can learn all kinds of good wages 'are offered. The
common hay and grain handler can get from $i 25 to
$2 30 per day and found. The more expert harvesters
can earn more. Order after order has been sent to
the employment offices here, and still they remain un
filled. There has been some talk to the effect that the
laboring men in the city have not the means to reach
the farms and that is what is keeping them from
going into the country. Whatever may be the rea
son, the fact remains the same â the fanners are sadly
in need of help and hundreds of idle men are to be
seen around the city every day asking for work."
There is apparently no justification for the belief
that city workingmen out of employment cannot avail
themselves of the demand for labor elsewhere by
reason of a lack of means to get to the places where
work is to be obtained. It has long been the custom
of the employer to advance the money necessary for
transportation. Men who are willing to work can
therefore with comparative ease obtain situations at
good wages for the harvest season at least if they de
sire it.
Such being the condition of affairs, it is time for
the people of San Francisco to be less generous to
.sturdy beggars on the street. There are too many
people whr> renlly need help to make it commendable
to support in idleness and vagrancy those who do not
need it. As a rule the well to do people of American
cities are so thoughtless' in their liberality to street
beggars that we are maintaining in every city in the
Union a class of such persons that ought to be pun
ished rather than helped.
That, however, is a minor issne at present. The
one thing to be done now is to make clear to the un
employed of the city that abundant work at good
wages awaits them, if they choose to apply for it.
The work must be done, for the farmers and orchard -
ists cannot afford to lose their crops. Unless white
men will undertake the work, a resort must be made
to' Asiatic labor. Thus a double harm will come if the
unemployed whites prefer to loaf in the city rather
than to work in the country. California has plenty of
work for all her industrious citizens and those who
have no share at all in the general prosperity of the
year will have only themselves to blame if they neg
lect to earn it.
THE AUTOMOBILE AND ITS USES.
rROM the rapidity with which improvements
have been made upon the earlier designs of
automobiles, and from the success which has
of late attended their use both in Europe and in this
country, it i^ now evident we are dose upon the time
when they will constitute an important, if not the
chief, means of transportation for freight and pas
sengers over comparatively short distances.
Two difficulties confronted the inventors in seek
ing to device a self-propelling vehicle suitable for
general use in cities and along country roads. One
of these was that of fashioning a machine that would
not be too heavy or too complicated in its structure.
The other, that of providing a convenient, economi
cal and safe power for propelling it. Both these dif
ficulties have been now fairly surmounted, and the
automobile has been accomplished.
While the first successes with the new vehicles were
achieved in France, there is every reason to believe
American ingenuity has not failed in this, any more
than in other forms of mechanism, to outstrip- the
world. The machines . in use in Eastern cities.
whether propelled by gasoline engines or by com
pressed air. have proven to be of a high order of ex
cellence. So completely has their usefulness been
demonstrated that large plants are now engaged in
constructing them and large combinations of capital
have been formed for the purpose of supplying them
for use in all parts of the Union.
Among the cities which will soon have automo
biles for general use is San Francisco. That much
seems assured by the reports of the organization of a
company to put them into operation here. In any
event they will be introduced here before long, for
their economic value, as well as their convenience, is
so great that no progressive community will long be i
without them.
The introduction of the new vehicle into general
tire will work something like a revolution in the
forms of street transportation. The street car com
pany, which has been so aggressive in its encroach
ments upon the property. of the city, will then have
a competitor that will soon bring it to terms. The auto
mobile will require neither rails, cables, poles nor wires
to perform its work. It will be able to handle pas
senger traffic more cheaply than the street cars and
more conveniently, and may eventually emancipate
the streets from the domination of the car lines alto
gether.
One of the chief advantages to be expected from
the automobile is that of transferring freight across
the city and for considerable distances in the coun
try. In a' recent trial an automobile made a trip
from Cleveland, Ohio, to New York City at a rate
of seventeen miles an hour. That is not equal to the
speed that has been attained on French roads, but it
shows what the vehicle can accomplish on the average
American highway. Clearly the age of the horse as
a draught animal is nearly over. The automobile will
do all his work.
Pugilist Kennedy's friends are of the opinion that
Pugilist Ruhlin. considering the fact that he is to get
the lion's share of the purse in their coming fight,
should also take that animal's share of the punish
ment.
â¢ If there is any truth in the reports from Wardner,
Idaho, concerning the ill-treatment of white women
by the negro soldiery, the verdict that "the colored
troops fought nobly" will have to be reversed.
It is reported in the newspapers that the schooner
W. S. Phelps had a hair-raising experience on her
last voyage. She must have sailed the Indian Ocean.
WILL RISK HIS LIFE
TO TEST HIS FENDER
Cjp& FENDER that will fend is
â¢ A thought .to that at last been
thought to have at last been
Jr â \ discovered. Its inventor, Ed
*J . *^ ward Wehrhan of Jefferson.
Tex., has such confidence in
its efficiency that he has offered to
test It by standing in front of a rapid
ly moving car equipped with his device
in the streets of St. Louis in order
to convince the managers of the street
railways of that city that he has per
fected a fender that will fend. The
thrilling test is expected to take place
shortly and will be looked forward to
with deep interest by the street rail
road men of the entire country, and
if the fender is successful it will mark
a new era in life-saving apparatus.
The inventioxi consists of a double
fender, or a. combination of two. The
lower fender picks up the body lying
on the track and the upper fender
lands the person caught in a stand
ing position. The lower fender throws
the object between it and the upper
one, while the top fender lands a man
on the top of it. giving him six feet
of space from the front of the dash
board, which is all the space desired
for the protection of legs and feet.
The bottom fender is placed just suf
ficiently above the rails to clear thorn
and extends four feet from the Hash
board on the dead level. The top fen
der rests on an angle mensuring six
feet from the dashboard.
"THE LIARS"
AS SEEM BY A
LADY CRITIC
One approaches a review of "The Liars"
with eager pen, for while the cold eye
of the critic brings to the surface im
possfble situation? and unreal people mov
ing in a most conventional world, the
grace and charm of the unreality compel
admiration and make on.' hesitate to
point th.' shortcomings. "The Liars" is
the most cleverly constructed play we
luive Feen in a twelvemonth, wherein a
most unworthy person, one Lady Jessica,
with a unique species of brute for a hus
band, carries on a ilirtation with a cer
tain Edward Falkner to the point of real
1. v.\ possible intrigue and consequent so
cial ruin, and when detection heels her
closely, sits down in a panic with folded.
meditative hands, while those about her
proceed to lie her back to her husband's
hearth ami what we feel must be to her
dull respectability.
A 'comed > in four acts, the programme
r<:nls. but surely 'tis the height of trag
edy to love â¢< woman as Edward Falkner
loved the Ladj Jessica, and know at last
that Bhe is to live out her life with a
Gilbert Napean i whose unnecessarily
brutal ton.-, as played by Mr. Standing,
is surely more than the author intended),
while lie goes to Africa to light for his
country, caring naught the while whether
or not humanity is swepi from the con
tinent, from Cairo to Cape Town, and
from Teneriffe t<> Zanzibar, and all this
for the sake of conventionality. Morality
is not the key note to virtue in the world
Henry Arthur Joins so cleverly paints.
For the good friend of everybody, Colonel
Sir Christopher Deering, rails my lady
back to her senses through fear of Mrs.
Urundy, and the value she sets upon a
place In society.
We are conscious, now that the charm
of 9cene, and color, and light, and wo
men not beautiful, but well gowned and
moving well; of perfectly groomed men,
and musical voices speaking clever
phrases, is vanished, that these people,
excepi Falkner and Sir Christopher, are
not real people, and that their world is
not a good one to dwell In. Mr. Miller's
Sir Christopher is played with so much
dignity and clearness of purpose that we
regret the little pantomime touches so
meaningless and unnecessary that mar an
otherwise perfect performance, and at the
close of the second act run perilously
dose to Pierrol without the saving grace
of costume. No English gentleman of
breeding is ever so frankly hungry, ex
cept in farce comedy. And why allow
the third curtain to tall on a laugh? Our
emotions are deeply touched when Falk
ner tells the truth at Lady Jessica's bid
ding, and the merriment is irritating, the
line that calls it forth superfluous. Mr.
Morgan's portrayal of Edward Falkner
is the most convincing thing we have seen
in modern plays for many a day. Such
men as Falkner are not born to happi
ness. They are the product of a long an
cestry of noble dee,ds and deep loves and
strong passions too often uncontrolled.
Mr. Morgan does not act. He is the
man. and may safely rest his reputation
as ;m actor on such a performance. Miss
Anglin plays the most unworthy Jessica.
against our better Judgment, straight into
our hearts. True genius lurks in her
pauses and her facial expressions are a
revelation. The production in its entirety
is a most melodious chord of harmony,
and only lack of space confines our criti
cism to the dominant notes.
See "The Liars," that its musical
echoes may awake to rill the void that
lies always in the future possibilities of
San Francisco. And. if you can afford it,
patronize their haberdashers and tailor*
and modistes to the confusion of discord
We bow to Mr. Miller and his company!
Would they might know how worthy we
are of their permanent residence here

The Aged Gardener's;
Story Believed to j
Rft True. i
â¢with boer by him at thp hour th^ par
doner says they stopped there.
"T net iced the woman particularly."
"naid William- yesterday, "'from the
sunbonnet ?he wore. It was a black
cmc, and I thought it was rather an
odd one to wear in such a place. I
did not notice whether or not tlii rr
was a child with thr old couple. There
might have been. When they left the
saloon they started up Park street in
the direction of Alameda."
The bonnet described by Williams
fits the description of that worn by
Mrs. Wlttholl. The r<><=t of his state
ment, if it fits ChaÃe's at all. bears the
gardener out in the statement that the
woman voluntarily accompanied and
drank with him. It also contradicts
the st'>ry told by Mrs. Wlttholl that
she chased his buggy four or five miles
in the hot sun.
The mere fact that Mrs. Wittholl
was exhausted when she finally
reached home at 6:30 o'clock on Tues
day night with her grandson, while it
at first gave color to her story that
she had had the run she described, was
vi. wed yi sterday in an absolutely
different light, and as corroborative of
Chase's story. The mere fart that the
aped woman wandered in the hot sun
from the bay near the Sixteenth-street
station in Oakland to the tidal canal
crossing at Alameda and back againâ
a full distance of ten miles as the crow
fli<-~â would account for her exhaustion
and for that of the little fellow, who
<x>uld not have been so badly off had
he been given the buggy ride she de
scribt 1.
If Chase's story, corroborated in
p;irt. is true, the abduction took place
unly in Mrs. Wittholl's imagination,
probably surcharged by the heat and
the worriment consequent on finding
that she had wandered so far in a city
unfamiliar to her that she had lost her
bearings. When she left the house of
her daughter. Mrs. Maguire. 1421 Sev
enteenth street, she said she would be
back at noon. She does not explain
how she came to forget to return home
before the time she met Chase.
The aged gardener, who has been
charged with abduction, will probably
have his preliminary hearing to-day
if Mrs. Wittholl, who was able to go to
the prison yesterday and identify him,
has fully recovered her strength.
woods will stand in space allotted exclu
sively to them, the wines, while taking
their place in the vitioultural exhibit, will

the entire list.
Mr. Runyon says there need be no fear
that California will not get all that is
coining to her. Commissioner General
Peck expressed himself as highly pleased
by the showing that has thus "far been
mnde by tln> Golden State. He said that
though California was three thousand
miles from the scene- of action, yet she
had come to the front mor.e strongly than
any other State in the Union, both in
money and energy. 'I he State's appro
priation of $l"ft.ooft was the largest of any
and the active interest being manifested
had boon equaled by no other State. In
the distribution of space Mr. Peck said
things would all be taken Into considera
tion.

PLACED CONFIDENCE.
4.
Ex-Deputy LÂ«nnon Swears That All I
the Employes Gambled, the
Office Being Nicknamed
"Federal Paddock."
Osca M. Welburn went on the stand in
Judge de Haven's court yesterday after
noon and testified in his own behalf. He
i wore the soldier's suit of blue that he
'â  had on when captured at drill at the Pre- j
[ sidio and was a tall, straight, stalwart
j looking soldier. . ;
There was a large crowd in the court- j
room to listen to his story, and among the j
; most interested x of his auditors were his j
wife and daughter and his son Clyde. The j
1 defendant was remarkably self-possessed
and gave his testimony without the slight- ]
est hesitation. â¢
It was the same story told by him two
years ago, to the effect that Dillard had \
forged his name and had collected check? !
j for certain employes of the Revenue De- i
partment without his consent or author-
I ity. He said that Akins was acting lor j
! Captain Ypungberg and that he had never j
) any reason to suspect that Akins or
Youngberg did not get the full salary due.
He had never authorized Dillard or any
: one else to sign the names of Akins or
others to their checks. All that he knew
was that when the payrolls and salary \
vouchers were ready they were laid upon i
; his desk and he signed them, believing !
i them to be correct. Furthermore, he [
I never instructed Dillard or. any one else
to go to the Bub-Treasury and get money '
on the checks. He supposed that the
clerks and deputies for whose salaries
the warrants had been drawn collected the
money at the Sub-Treasury themselves. I
With reference to the charge of with
j holding part of the salary- of Miss Connelt.
i the witness said that he informed Loupe
' that a stenographer and typewriter was
: wanted in the office to expedite the work
\ necessitated by the income tax law. He
received a letter of application from Miss
Conneli, and the first that he knew after
that was that Loupe had installed Miss
Conneli in his private office. He had no
conversation with Miss Connell as to her
salary or employment. He never knew
that she was not getting her full salary.
j He had turned the check for her salary
I over to Loupe and he himself never han
dled any of the money.
When Miss M. McCarthy was sick, he
said, her work was done in the' office by
C. L. Harter, and Mr. Welburn was not
aware that she was dead at the time the,
: payroll was signed for her salary. He
understood all along that Harter got the
â  money. He never spoke to Dillard about
: her case.
The defendant's testimony was similar
: as to all the other cases. He will be cross
examined to-day.
Edward F. Lennon of Red Bluff, form
erly a deputy in Welburn's office, testi
fied that all the employes sent money to ;
i the races by Dillard to be invested with
j the bookmakers for them, and the office ;
was conducted in a slipshod manner. Be- .
cause of the gambling indulged in by the
employes the Revenue Office received the
; nickname of the "Federal paddock." .
Congressman Julius Kahn, Garret Me
-1 Enerney, E. Watkins and others testified i
to the good reputation of Welburn before ;
! the charges had been filed against him.
F. Bettis. landlord of the house in which
; Louis Loup? lodged, testified that on one
occasion shortly after the suicide of ;
] Cashier Norton he saw Loupe burn a
â  large number of documents in his room.
The trial will be resumed at 10 o'clock
! this morning.
BLACK TROOPS
OFF FOR THE
PHILIPPINES
Sailed on Transport
Zealanclia.
Pan Francisco said good-by to nearly 700
of Uncle Sam's colored troops yesterday
afternoon. They sailed on the transport
Zealandia from Pacific-street wharf, and
a big crowd of the relatives and friends of
the men were down to see them off. Com
panies C, E, G and I of the Twenty-fourth
Infantry, under command of Major J. M.
Thompson, were brougnt over early in the
afternoon on the quarantine steamer Mc-
Dowell from the Presidio and put aboard
the transport. Later 150 recruits were
marched to Pacitio-street wharf, and
when they went aboard the transport
Bailed. All the companies of the Twenty
fourth are recruited up to' their full '^
strength of 12* men, so the ZealancMa took
away a few short of 700 soldiers.
The transport Valencia with the re
mainder of the Twenty-fourth aboard will
sail to-day. The Sheridan, with a big
crowd of recruits, will depart to-morrow,
and the Pennsylvania with a full regi
ment will sail on Sunday. The Wyeh'eld,
with her 50<ki tons of stores for the troops.
will get away to-day or to-morrow, so
that five transports will be on their way
by Sunday next. That will leave only the
Conemaugh in port, and she will sail
again during next week with another load
of cavalry horse?.
Every one of the men on the Zealandia
took a' few fireworks along, and the men
are going to have a Fourth of July of j
their own at sea.
The steamer Australia of the Oceanic
Company's line will L-.;- ready to take up
her usual run on July 3. Captain How
ard, the company's superintendent, is see-
Ing that no time Is wasted and in conse
quence very rapid progress is being made.
When the steamer got in last Tuesday the
workmen, were rushed aboard as soon as
she was tied up at the wharf. By G p. m.
all the wood work had been torn away
and the deck raised so that the men
could get under it and work. Tuesday
night the steamer went to the refinery
and Wednesday 1400 tons of sugar were
discharged and 600 tons of coal put Into
the bunkers, and Thursday morning Â»>arly
the mail boat vrafl back at her Pa-'ine
street dock. All this time the repair work
went on with a rush, and the vessel will
sail again on July ?,. Captain Howard's
long experience enables him to get an im
mense amount of work done quickly with
out the slightest appearance, of hurry or
confusion.
The French bark Amiral Troude had a
narrow escape from going on Point Arena

"God bless you." said the wandering

"And you've .eaten enough to fill an

and then he seized a water front iron

victim went to the Harbor Hospital to

AN AGED FATHER'S SUIT.
John A. Shepston Seeks to Make His
Sons Support Him.
ARfd John A. Shepston appeared in
Judge Murasky's court yesterday to press
his suit against his three sons, John A.
Jr.. Harry T. and George C. Shepston,
for maintenance. In his complaint Mr.
Shepston sets form that he is past 63
years of ago, paralyzed In both legs, ill
and penniless. At present he Is living with
his sister. Mrs. Moran, who assists him
aa much as her financial condition will
admit, hut as he holds that his children
should assist him in bib old age. as he did
them when they Were young, he wiil
press his suit to a final decision.
On behalf of th" sonfi an attempt was
made to prove that .Mr. Shepston had left
his home of his own free will, and his
pn sent condition is the result of sins ot
his own which resulted in Mrs. Shepston
refusing to recognize him as her hus
band. " Judge Murasky, however, re
fused to allow tlvse matters to bo
argued. and he tooK the case
under submission solely on the evidence
introduced to prove the moneys the sons
are now receiving and the present needs
of the plaintiff.
Mr. Shepston has another suit on record
In which he se *ks to recover possession
of property now in the bands of his wife,
Mrs Catherine M. Shepston. he claiming
that he deeded it to her in trust for his
own benefit, but she kÂ» pt the income, and

THE IRON TRADE.
Advances In the price of Iron seem to be en
tirely normal. says the New York Commercial.
Tnpy are due to a demand which exceeds the
supply and which promises to continue indefi
nitely. The reason is plain. During the sea
fti of depression, whs covered a period of
il\e years, improvements of every kind were
almost at a standstill. The return of good times
dated building, and, In fact, every kind
of construction. Iron quotations are a harome
ter. an.! far from being: alarming, they indi
cate that If there is to be a reaction it is still
far in the future.
Ot'R COMMERCIAL STATUS.
The New York circular Of Henry Clews says:
"For the last seventeen months the exports
exceed the Imports by $670,803,000. It seems
to be generally conceded that, after allowing
for some minor creditor items, about J1R0.000.
--000 net por year is required for payments to
other countries on account of interest, ocean
freights, traveling credits and other minor
Items. On these non-commercial items
we have, therefore, lid to pay. during
the seventeen months, about JiJo.OOO.OOO: to
which must be added J20.000.000 for the in
demnity to Spain; making a combined debtor
pun of $273,000,000. If to this latter sum we.
sdd the n<u amount accruing on the securi
ties movement, namely $360,000,000, we have a
total of iii 30.000.000 of debtor items to offset the
$670,803,000 creditor balance accruing on tho
purely commercial and specie movements. It
wonld thus, appear that then* should be a
creditor balance of about 530.000.000 till out
ftanding to our favor in Europe. Relatively,
thi* is not a specially important factor either
one way or another. An adverse condition if
the European money markets, or a necessity
t'> procure gold lor the ' impending loans to
Russia. Japan and Mexico might easily Induce
return? of our securities that would well nigli
extinguish this balance. Meanwhile, the ex
cess of exports over imports is fast diminish
ing. The exports of merchandise nd specie
for May amounted to $100,321,000 while the im
j<irtr- were â  211,000, showing a creditor bal

ncurt-s show that we have reached a condl
lion in nur foreign eiclfenges in which the
creditor balance on commercial account but

swelled by the products of our new crops,
which may quite possibly bring gold this way

NBW vr.p.K STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 22.â The bears secured the
upper band in the trading to-day and ac
complished a. downward range of prices, which
Rave â¢in' appearance of extreme weakness to
the market at one time during the day. But
â  -with thÂ» initial rise in prices and the rally
. on covering; after the drop, the net -changes are
small In the majority of cases. The market
opened with an upward movement and with
more show' l of animation In the buying than
has liet-n the case for some time. The foreign
stock markets reflected am* more cheerful
frame of mind over the political outlook. in
France, and there was a continuation of the
polling pressure from that source which has
)<een a feature several days this we<Â«k. The
railway Btocks, especially the grangers, moved
upward smartly, and very conspicuous gains
were shown by a number of the Vanderbilt
Mocks. There was good baying of some of the
leading specialties, tobacco stocks rallying
briskly from yesterday's extreme weakness
and Sujrar and Brooklyn Transit being well
taken. Wit.M the exception of the drop In
American Spirits and standard distributing on
the announced combinational! that trade, there
was apparently no weak spo^ in the market
and it looked as though .the bears had ex
hausted tin-:"- resources and. abandoned their
campaign. But very marked iveakrH.-s.-i noon de
veloped in Federal Steel and quickly. Involved
other Flower slocks, as well as Hucar. Kx
treme declines were in Sugar 4%, Federal Steel
Si. Brooklyn Transit and Consolidated Gas
2%.
The Vonderbllts, tobacco stocks and many
. railroads held pretty well, but the grangers
yielded a point or over. 'though their declines
*n the day are only a fraction. There was con-
I slderable activity on the decline and more
! appearance of liquidation* by tired holders than
j has been apparent before this week. The late
I Belling movement was based on apprehensions
expressed by the bears of very heavy exports
of cold on Saturday. Rome of the estimates
\ ranging as high as $10,000,000, though the only
; announcement was the engagement of 12,000,

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ situation at Chicago seemed
improved. The market opened firmer on for
eign cables. Liverpool advanced on account of
the unfavorable weather in France and drought
in Southern Russia,, where the recent rains
came too late to be of much service. The dam
age in France is caused by too much rain.
Toward the close the market was very stiff
A good Continental demand all over the world
was reported, and recent bad reports from In
diana and Illinois were confirmed. ' New York
reported large orders for export, amounting to
90 loads, and cash sales at Chicago footed un
450.000 bushels.
Locally futures were firmer, but the spot
market was unchanged. '

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
The canner3 are paying the following prices: j
Peaches. $20 for frees and $30 for clings; Apri
cots, $3.Vur.o per ton, according to size, quality
and district: Bartlett Pears, $40JT45 per ton; I
Green and Yellow Plums, $20 per ton. .
Dealers are waking up to the fact that with j
the exception of Peaches and Apples the fruit i
crop of the State has been overestimated this :
year. The free shipments to the East have
diverted so much fruit from this city that the
market is now moderately supplied and the j
tendency in prices is rather upward. In look- :
ing back It is seen that Cherries, Gooseberries,
| Currants and Strawberries have been in mod
i erute receipt right along, and now Plums are
i getting scarce, with an advance on canning
! account, as will be seen above. If the present i
deficiency continues prices during the balance
of the season will probably be good.
Fluctuations yesterday were neither numerous
nor wide. The general tone of the market was
firm. â -â â â â¢ -â

HE STOLE HIS BRIDE
Miss Ethe! French and Charles Whipple
With Whom She Eioped to Stockton.
.^^N AKLAND, June 22.â Young: Mr, and Mrs. Whipple have gone to Stock-
Oto live, accompanied by the best wishes of his parents and no
II II wishes at all from hers. They were married on the 12th of June,
\^ = Â£/ with no one present but the legal quorumâ themselves, an accom
modating witness and a 'Justice of the Peace. Her father was not
present tn give the bride away, for had he been there the giving away of
the rid? would have had to be dispensed with, so he was not notified. In
fact, it was not until the bride and groom were safely housed in Stockton
That he learned there had been a wedding.
Th- engagement of Charles Whipple of East Oakland and Miss Ethel
French had been known by their friends for over a year, but not until
lately was' it known there would be trouble about it. Whipple has been a
waller it the French home for three or four years, but after the engage
ment was announced it was made plain to him he was not so welcome as
he had been before. It ended two weeks ago in a direct order from the
young lady's father that he go away and stay away and cease his aspira
tions and his intentions and anything else he thought bound him to the
family.
There was nothing- to do but act on the order, and Whipple left, but he
managed to make an appointment with Mlps French the next day. and the
meeting ended in a ceremony and .a hasty flight to Stockton. The bride had
slipped away from home without expecting a wedding, and so one of her
friends provided the trousseau from her own wardrobe. The prolonged
ah.vnre of his daughter finally led French to suspect something was wrong,
so he started out to look for her. He did not find the new Mrs. Whipple,
but he learned what had been done, and he is now nursing his wrath.
While the relatives of the bride were so violently opposed to the mar
riage, the relatives of the groom took a different view. They had known
Miss French since she came to Oakland, about five years ago, and they
have only kind words for her. She was bright and popular and much ad
mired, and she made her father's house on Tenth street a most hospitable
one. Whipple's relatives live in East Oakland, at 1012 Tenth avenue. It
was there the newly married young neople went after the wedding, but they
stayed only until the train for Stockton bore them away from the storm
they knew was coming. It fell mainly on the bride's friends, but they care
but little. They think her father believed he could choose better than she.
and they take much satisfaction In the fact that the girl chose for herself,
There are many of their friends who know nothing of the wedding even
yet. however, and when matters become more temporal announcements
will be sent out. .â ,
Whipple is a painter by trade. Tie was in busines for a number of yeans
In Oakland and then moved over to San Rafael, where he was employed
when he decided to brave parental wrath and hold his own wedding. He In

The young girl was horrified at the pn>
|s and immediately gave the letter
i.. her guardians. In turn they took the
letter to the postal authorities and a trap
whs laid for the self-styled M. Day. A
Utter purporting to be an answer to that
received by Miss Brahany, was written
and forwarded to the address given In
the Day letter. Back came an answer,
and in it the young woman was requested
to me-t the writer at Third and Market
streets last evening at 8 o'clock.
At the hour named Biakoley material
ized, and shortly thereafter Postal In
spector Krwin approached him and said:
â  How do you do, Mr. Blakeley?"
"How do you do?" said Blakeley in re
turn; "l remember your face, but can't
recall your name. "
"My name is Alice," said Mr. Brwln,
"and I have in my pocket a warrant for
your arrest en a charge of sending ob
scene letters through the mails."
The printer collapsed, bui confessed
that he was the writer of tii.' ] itter, ex
cusing his action however, on the ground
that he did not know i, ; at it was againsi
the law to write such letters. He was
informed thai hi was lacking in knowl
edge, and was taken to the County Jail
and placi d b< '.â >.'! the bars.
When he was searched another adver
tisement, doubtlfss intended for publica
tion, was found upon his person, in which
he requires any young lady applying for
the position he offered to be young and
pretty and not too particular regarding
her morals.
The postal authorities believe thai the
prisoner is a moral pervert, and that by
his arresi dishonor of some young and
innoci h! girl has been prevented.

THE COMMITTEES MAKE
PROGRESSIVE REPORTS
BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR FOURTH
OF JULY CELE3RATION.
The Parade Will Be the Most Gor
geous Pageant Ever Sgeh. in
San Francisco.
President George R. Fletcher of the
Fourth of July Committei was kept busy
Â«t the meeting of the committee last
night rapping for order. The reports of
the various committees usually provoked
a general dl cv - â¢ n, and ;>s everybody
wanted to talk at onci and the majority
of those talking had any number of sub
stitute motl ns to nffei and also sumo
personal experiences, much confusion was
the result.
A communication was read from the
Pacific Coast Musicians' Union' in which
i; was stated that the union had heard
thai tlv Musicians' Mutual Protective
Union was to secure the contract for fur
nishing the music on the Fourth of July.
The former union in its letter protested
againsi this and made a number of
charges against th. Mutual Union and also
againsi thi committee In the matter of
partiality. J. â¢'â¢ Levy was heard in be
half of the Pacific Coast Musicians'
Union and A. Dijeau in behalf of the
Musicians' Mutual Protective Union.
President Fletcher read a letter from
Secretary Rosenberg of the San Francisco
l.ai or < Jouncll, in which be stated that
the Musicians' Mutual Protective union
was the only organization recognized by
the Labor Council. There was a groat
deal of discussion and upon a motion ot
X w Lees the subject matter was re
ferred back to the music committee.
A most favorable report was received,
from the tin. inc.' committee. The com*
mittee on Invitations was empowered to
â  ! tie sum of $20 for invitations. This
matter provoked much discussion, some
members nf the committee heing in favorof
expending a larger amount. Trie commit
tee "ii badges, upon a motion of \\ . J-
Herrin, was empowered to expend Job so
for '.'i" badges.
Thomas P. Robinson reported that the
committee on parade was working with
great success and that it was confident
of having the finest parade over made in
San Francisco. The Eintracht Verein, the
San Francisco Verein, Mission Turn ver
ein and the Kreiger Verein will all turn
out. They will have their drum corps,
military organizations and tumblers. The
Native Sons "i Alameda and Oakland will
also I-- in the parade. There will be a
large number of beautiful floats, among
them a Chinese creation. A great number
nf bands will be in the parade, so there
will be no lack of music. In this connec
tion Mr Robinson asked for power upon
the part of tin 1 parade committee, to be
allowed to close contracts and secure ex
tra music if needed. His request was
granted. , , Â
The reports of the literary and hall
committees showed that good progress
was being made. Metropolitan Hall has
been secured by the latter committee and
: - a very large crowd is expected steps
have been taken looking toward secur
ing the Grand Opera-bouse and the Al
hambra.
The report ot the tir. works committee
brought out a long and tiresome discus
sion. The committee announced that the
places selected for the display of the fire
works was Glen Park, in the Mission,
and the vacant lots mar tin chutes. The
;\Â«,o displays are to cost $750 each. "Dan"
Crowley said ho thought the citizens of
North Beach wore entitled to a display
also; then Alta Plaza's representatives de
clared that if North Beach had a display
they were also entitled to one, and so on
from â  liff'-r- nt sections of the city. Fin
ally the discussion waa ended by the mat-
It r going over until Saturday night for
final action.
The repori of the regatta committee re
vealed the tact that there was a strong
sentiment in favor of having the regatta
held on some other day than the Fourth.
'i'h.' question \sas discussed at great
length and all sorts of motions and
amendments were carried and lost, but
the matter was finally settled for the
night by the appointmeni of Frederick
Raabe as a committee to confer with the
regatta committee and to report back at
the next meeting.
A committee will be appointed to visit
the Mayor and various merchants of the
city with a view of trying to get them to
suspend business on Monday. It is
thought that tliis can be accomplished,
as very little business can be done on
thai day.
BELL'S ESTATE INSOLVENT.
Family Allowance of the Late Mil
lionaire May Be Cut Off.
George StaackF, executor of the will of
th-:- late Thomas Bell, who at one time
ranked among the millionaires, took the
stand in Judge i 'offer's court yesterday
and confessed that in his opinion deced
ent's estate was insolvent. In all prooa
i>ilit\ Mrs. Bell's family allowance will
now b" stopped. When Bell died, six
years ago, Mrs. Bell was allowed JfWjO
a month. This allowance has now dwin
dled down to $100 a month, and there still
remains unpaid to her from the allow
ance the sum of $50,000, but in all proba
bility she will never gel it.
It lias been rumored from time to time
that the executor said that he would pax-
Mrs. Bell'B claim whether the creditors
e;nt anything or not, and this has caused
Louisa J. Thompson, trustee of the es
tate of Mary A. Thompson, who has an
allowed claim against the estate for some
$1". oho. to ask Judge ("offey to order the
executor to show cause why he should
not cease to pay Mrs. Rell any further
allowance at all. The executor will be
heard upon the matter July 10.
Owing to the unsettled condition of the
estate n bid of $20,000 offered for the
Providence mine, situated in Mexico.
but which is appraised at $100,000, was
withdrawn, and this money, which would
have greatly assisted in relieving the
present financial strain, wifl not be forth
coming.
In Judge Trout fs court the Insolvency
proceedings against "Mammy" Pleasant,
for years a familiar figure in the Rell
'Household, were taken up. (Jeorge R.
Baton was appointed assignee of
"Mammy's" estate by the creditors, and
he will immediately hngin his labors of
liquidating their demands. â¢
SPIRITUALISTS REPLY.
Three of Their Leaders Criticise the
Utterances of Bishop Moreland.
Fully 20fl spiritualists gathered at lowor
Scottish Hall last evening to hoar \y\\
linm Emmett Coleman. Julia Sehlesinger
and Juhn Slater reply to Bishop More
land, who made caustic strictures on
spirit ualiÃtic belief in his sermon last
Sunday. The three speakers commented
upon Bishop Moreland'S attitude toward
their faitli in lively fashion, but none
of them attempted to abuse the Bishop
for his utterances.
The three defenders of. spiritualism ex
plained the doctrines of spiritualism and
compared them With those of other re
ligions. Julia Schlesingcr's address was
particularly interesting. She is a woman
of exceedingly fine abilities, well educated
and an excellent extemporaneous speaker.
OFFICERS SELECTED
FOR THE PRIMARIES
SUCCESS OF ELECTION COMMIS
SIONERS' EXPERIMENT.
Representative Citizens Will Be
Chispn to Serve on the
Precinct Boards.
The new plan of the Election Commis
sioners for selecting primary election of
ficers was given a trial last night and
proved most successful. The Thirtieth
District was selected for the experiment,
| and by 8 o'clock a large number of voters
I of that district who bad been cited to ap
pear before the board were in attendance
I at the Registrar's office. Commissioners
Phelan. Lane, Wells and Sheehan were
present, together with Registrar Step
pacher.
Mayor Phelan explained to the assem
blage that the board hud cited them in
accordance with the new primary law.
He quoted the object of the law, Raying
that it<was purely in the Interest of good
; government. Primary election officers
must serve without pay, but he hoped
â  every man would be willing to perform
his duty In the interest of good citizen- I
ship. In order to secure good' municipal j
officers it was necessary to have repre
sentative conventions, which had not been
the case in the past.
It was decided to take up the first con- j
solidated precinct of the Thirtieth Dis- ;
trict, and the Registrar called the names I
; of those who had been cited from what is I
known as the Thirteenth precinct one
at a time. The law requires that three
: Democrats and three Republicans shall
; constitute the election officers in each
precinct, and after questioning all who
answered their names the following were
â  selected for the Thirteenth: Daniel Cro-
I nln. Republican, and William F. Healy
, and J. H. O'Brien, Democrats.
The men selected for the Fourteenth
precinct were B. G. Somers, Republican,
and Edward McDevitt and Frederick E.
Rockstrohl. Democrats.
The Fifteenth precinct did better, all i
the officers being secured, as follows: Eu- '
gene Sullivan. Richard Purcell and
Thomas O'Brien, Democrats, and P. Bur
gess, H. Hilderbrandt and Frank C. Stabe,
Republicans.
In the Sixteenth precinct John H. Gil- |
more. George H. Walcott and George
Werner. Democrats, and Henry B. Rus.s
and Frederick Koch. Republicans, were
accepted.
Two Democrats and two Republicans
were secured in the Seventeenth precinct,
as follows: William .1. Cleary and James
H. Riley, Democrats, and Philip Cohen
and William A. Vetter, Republicans.
The board was well satisfied with the
result and derided to cite voters from the
Thirty-first, Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth
districts, and enough to till out the vacan- I
cies In the Thirtieth to appear before it
next Tuesday night. Those who answered '
last night were very representative citi
zens and it seems likely that an excellent
set of officers will be secured.
Commissioner Sheehan offered the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted:
Whereas. suit lias been commenced against
the Hoard of Election Commissioners to test
the validity of the primary election law
Resolved, That Morris M. Esl and Gavin
McXab be employed by the Board of Election '
j Commissioners to represent the board, in con- '
i junction with City and County Attorney Lane.
who is hereby directed to control the litigation
1 In the matter of N. ,T. Hritton vs. the Board
; of Election Commissioners et al.
The board then adjourned till Tuesday
morning, when it will meet for the pur
pose of opening bids for printing and sup- I
plies.

POLL TAX IMBROGLIO.
The case of Charles .7 McGlynn of the \
| Hibernla Bank, charged with refusing to
give his name to a deputy Assessor, was
called in Judge Graham's court yesterday
morning 1 .
Attorney Alford. on behalf of Assessor
I Dodge, said there was no desire to prose
cute the case, as the Assessor had obtain
!ed the information he wanted. Attorney
Stafford for the defendant objected to the
matter being disposed of in such a way,
as statements had been made which were â 
' not in accordance with the facts.
The Judge ordered F. L. Putnam, the I
1 complaining witness, to take the stand, '
and. in answer to questions he admitted
I that when he accosted McGlynn he did j
i not show his -badge or tell him that he â 
was a deputy Assessor.
"Did you not, when you applied for the
warrant, state to me that you had told i
McGlynn you were a denuty Assessor and '
I that was why I issued the warrant?" j
' asked the Judge.
"I don't remember doing so." replied
Putnam, "and if I did it was done inad
vertently."
After some wrangling between counsel
, the Judge said he would not have issued
the warrant if he had known that 'he
deputy Assessor hal not informed Mc-
Glynn when he accosted i.:-n of his offi
cial position, and he thought it was an
outrage that McGlynn should have been
arrest d. He would dismiss the case and
i so ordered.

Declines to Compromise.
John 11. Bievers, who holds a judement
nq:ainst the city for 3woo for damage to
his property at the ccrner of Van Ness
avenue and Lombard street, has -served
notice on the Supervisors that their rffer
to comproinl?i for 11 has been rejected
and that the proceedings In the Sunreme
Court, which were continued until July 3.
pending the negotiations for a compro
mise, will be taken up and prosecuted if
the claim is not sei'i.,l by th:u date.

The Cit-v Not Liable.
Auditor Well? lifts refused to nnrlit the
j bills of the Preston School for the main

years of age, living al 8 Wayland street. They talked together for a few
minutes, and Cassinelli bragged thai he had Jl it. In his pocket. In a jocular
way the three boys made a grab at Cassinelli, who pulled the money cut of
his pocket and held it in his hand. He called Zobler an offensive name and
Zobler hit his hand, scattering the money on the street. One of the boys
grabbed a .->" cent piece niu! the trio ran away.
Cassinelli went home and told his father what had happened him. and
he hurried to the Potrero police station and demanded that the three boys be

TO TEST PRIMARY LAW.
Suit With That Object in ViÂ«w Filed
by Joseph Britton.
A suit to test the validity of the new
primary law was filed yesterday by Jo- j
seph Britton, who petitioned the Superior
Court to issue an injunction restraining
the Election Commissioners from pro- i
ceeding under thÂ»- act. Under the law the j
Blection Commission has power to con- i
so'.idate the 303 precincts in this county I
yo as to reduce the number to IOC. Work !
under the act has already been begun by j
the commission, and, as alleged by the '
petitioner, it is for the purpose of saving
the expense which will be incurred that
ilie suit is tiled.
It is claimed by Britton, who sues as a
taxpayer, that the primary law is con
trary to section 2. article 1. of the consti- ]
Tution. as well as section 1 of article 2. j
section 5 of article 2. sections 24 and 25 of |
article. 4. section 2 of article 20 and other
provisions of the State constitution. Vpon ,
the filing of the suit Judge Seawell Issued j
a temporary injunction restraining the
Commissioners in accordance with th >
1 prayer of t be complaint and directing
them to appear before him next Tuesday
to show cause why they should not be for
- restrained from further proceeding
under the law.
PARISHIONERS HONOR
A DEPARTING PASTOR
Father .McDonald, Who [* .Now in Charge
of St. Claries Chupefr
THAT Rev. James McDonald of St. Peter's Church Is beloved by his
parishioners was shown Wednesday evening, when a special committee
waited on him and presented him with a handsome gold. watch suitably
inscribed, a chain and locket and a finely engraved address, appropri
ately framed and mounted on an easel, as a token of their high esteem.
The presentation took place at the residence of Rev. P. Casey, corner of
Twenty-fourth and Florida streets, and was witnessed by Rev. P. Scanlon,
chancellor of the diocese: Rev. Father Casey, Father M. D. Connolly, Father
James McDonald. Father Lynch, Father C. E. O'Neil, Father .J. Grant.
Brother Erminold, Richard Curtis. P. J. Tormey, D. F. Keefe. Dr. Hugh 1,9.
--gan, Senator Dwyer, M. McCarthy. H. J. Pinkham. Thomas B. Slevin, J. c.
O'Donnell and T. K. Curtis.
Dr. LÂ»igan delivered the presentation speech and extolled the good deeds
of Father McDonald during his seven years of labor in the parish as assistant
pastor of St. Peter's Church, and expressed the hope that he would have
health and strength to continue his good work in his new field. The recipient
was greatly surprised at the appreciation of his congregation and feelingly
answered them. The framed address reads as follows:
Dear Father: We have heard with feelings of regTet and gladness of your appoint
ment to the pastorate of St. Charles parish in this city.
Wo are clad, of course, of your well-merited promotion; but even so, we cannot
help resr'ttlng that you must leave us. WJSd
For seven years you have labored amongst us, with untiring zeal. You have en
lightened us and instructed us by your forcible preaching. You have brought consola
tion to the hearts of our afflicted, and you have been un weary In your care of our
sick. \
Nor do we foriret, nor do we appreciate the less, your kindness to the homeless
and friendless ones of the City and County Hospital.
They had in you not only a zealous priest, but a sympathetic friend. "We feel in
a special manner indebted to you for the fatherly interest you have always taken in the
youth of our parish and for your constant labors for their welfare.
For all these benefits, beyond number and price, we are truly grateful, and it is
but natural that we are sorry to lose you.
Our Borrow, however, Is In some measure assuacred by the fact that you will be
our neighboring pastor.
It will be our privilece to pee you and to meet you- often, and we sincerely hope
that your friendly relations with St. Peter's parish, with its priests and with' its
people will continue as they are to-day during all the years of your ministry. "We
hope that success will crown all your efforts in your new and responsible career, and
that every wish of your priestly heart will be gratified. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 23, 1899.
MINEHAN RAN
AFOUL OF THE
CLAN TOMALTY
Sad Sequel to a Free
Beer Meeting.
ENDED IN GENERAL MIXUP
THE FAITHFUL ATTEMPTED TO
"PACK AWAY THE BOOZE."
The Unlucky Policeman Arrived on
the Scene at a Time When the
Fierce Battle Waged
the Hottest.
Policeman Mlnehan, who was severely
beaten by a gang of rowdies at the cor
ner nf Sixth and Mission streets early
yesterday morning while attempting to
arrest one of them, Is to be congratu
lated despite the faci that he was after- j
ward treated at the Receiving Hospital
for a broken nose and a badly-battered
head. Minehan might have, fared worse,
for Instead of running afoul of an aggre
gation iif Tar Flat hoodlums returning from
;i tri-weekly session of the Glass House
Social Club, as was at lirst supposed, hi
;rnt woefully tangled up with a bunch of '
southside politicians who were gloriously ;
charged with large quantities of free
steam beer that had been doled out to
them In spacious schooners at a meeting ;
of "Pat" Tomalty's Committee of I
Hundred push of the Thirtieth District.
The clan Tomalty had made elaborate
preparations to celt), rate the opening of
the campaign. They hired Academy Hall i
on Mission street between Fifth and Sixth
and flooded the district with florid hand- 'â 
bills inviting all good Democrats to at
tend the joyous occasion. Free beer in .
the Thirtieth was not to be sneered at, so !
when Tomalty called the meeting to order
shortly after 8 o'clock Wednesday night
the hall was literally jammed with south
side citizens from every neighboring dis- !
trict.
It was a proud moment for "Pat" To- '
malty. He had delivered the goods and
received congratulations from Frank
Gould, Bert Schleslnger and several
other notables who had been Imported
from down- town. To be sure it was a la
mentable calamity that his Honor, the
Mayor, u-as not there, but those "close
to-thi -throne" notables would surely in
form him that the tight looked good in'
Tomalty's district. Tomalty forsooth was
happy and his beaming countenance fol
lowed the flitting figure of his colored
stableman, who. arrayed especially for
the occasion iti one of Tomalty's whitesi
b;ir coats, was dispensing beer to the
ihir-tv In all portions of the hall.
When Tomalty's colored stab!, man
failed to dispense the beer rapidly i nough
the gang grew Impatient. Then some-'
body passed the cruel word around that |
the" gentleman of color, the chief dis
penser of beer, was not a member of the I
w liters' Union.
"He's a horse's valet." murmureTl
Mi<key under his breath, and forthwith
the gang Invaded the heretofore sacred
acts of the boozeroom. "Jlmmle"
Gannon and "Bugs" Killigan appointed 1
_
themselves masters of the ceremonies and
the beer came faster. It came too fast,
and thereby hangs the secfet of Police
man Mlnehan's misfortune.' The beer
kegs began to run dry and the gang soon
felt the torrid sensations of approaching
drought. The boozeroom czars went into
executive session and at once unanimous
ly decided that the occupants of the outer
hall had consumed enough of the precious
liquid.
Snipsey" Grimes hit upon the bright
Idea of removing the remaining keg of
beer to Tomalty'p stable only a half block
distant, where only the "close-up" mem
bers of the clan would be admitted. Em
mett Tomalty, a chip of the old block,
was called into consultation. It was a
task worth a man's life to attempt to
take beer out the front way, so Opie
Doakes, one of the faithful, was dis
patched posthaste to Tomalty's stable for
a rope. He returned shortly with a coil
of hemp and soon the beer keg was dang
ling at its end in its gradual descent to
the street below.
"They're stealing Johnnie Brown's keg
of beer!" shouted "Mugs" Flnnegan.
The meeting adjourned sine die then
and there and the gang rushed pell mell
into the street to frustrate the bold at
tempt to get away with the evening's
star attraction.
In less time than it takes to tell the
story, the crowd were in the throes of
combat. At this juncture Policeman
Minehan appeared upon the scene. He
grabbed young Tomalty and started to
hustle him off to the patrol box. Then
the clan forgot their personal differences
and they set upon Minehan to a man,
with dire results to him. V
"DUTCHY" WYMAN CAUGHT.
He Is Wanted on Two Charges of
Assault to Murder.
Charles, alias "Dutchy" Wyman, who is
well known to the police, was arrested
last evening by Detectives Dillon and
Crockett and charged with an assault to
commit murder. On June S "Wyman vis
ited a house kept by a woman named
Mary Dolan at t;4:~> Natoma street and
started a disturbance. A young man
named John Hank, who was present, at
tempted to eject him. when wyman drew
a knife and Stabbed him in the face and
thigh. The injured man was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where his wound*
were dressed.
Wyman disappeared immediately after
the cutting and was supposed to have left
the city. While walking along Stockton
street last evening Dillon and Crockett
saw him standing- in front of a cigar
store and they promptly placed him under
arrest. To-day an additional charge of
assault to commit murder will be placed
against Wyman for having cut a man
named Watson in the breast some time
ago.
MADE GOOD TIME.
Ten Mile Extension on Loop From
Lompoc to Surf Completed.
The ten-mile extension on the loop from
Surf to Lompoc on the coast division of
the Southern Pacific was completed yes
terday.
The work has been rushed through, tak
ing only seven or eight weeks from its
commencement to Its completion. This,
considering the magnitude of the task, is
remarkable time and will doubtless pro\.
highly gratifying to the fanners of that
section, as it affords them an opportunity
to market this season's crops by rail.
It is expected thai before very long the
gap on tin maiic line from Surf to Kl
wood will be bridged over and the long
expected continuous coast line from San
Francisco and San Jose to the Bouthern
part. of the State will have become an ac
complished fact.

he will kill the franchises, as they must

at all. Even If action be taken then

In which to take final action and ad

to tin 1 danger point of losing a Kreat j
public benefit.
Tlio flrsi petitioner to br hoard by the j
Street Committee yesterday afternoonj
was V*. w. Dohrmann, president of the
Merchants' Association. "We beg of |
ji>u. gentlemen," he said, "not to de- j
lay this matter. We understood that it
had all been agreed upon and we loft â¢
you si week -<> with thai belief. The j
franchises as they st:md now nre roa- â 
gonable, and 1 ask you not to permit
any captious objections to keep you;
from giving us the road we desire s<.< ;
much. We cannot always discuss what i
we would like to have, but what we
can Kft. mid I believe the railroad in j
this particular matter is reasonable.
1 understand that "T" rails will not be
used, ami th *y are the only rails to j
which we emphatically protest.
"We are willing to accept the fran
chises as they stand, and we hope the
amendments will be withdrawn. We
want a crosstown road, and I believe
if this new obstruction is removed we
will get on upon reasonable terms. 1
beg of you not to delay."
"This whole matter," interrupted
Supervisor Holland, "was agreed upon
by the Mayor, this committee and citl
zens a week ago. I do not understand
who now objects, except the Mayor and
his minority."
Henry Lynch, representing the Mar
ket-street Company, here assured the
committee that if the franchise were
obtained a written promise would be
given that no "T" rails will be used
In the downtown districts, and that
only a fiat rail will be utilized. This
seemed to settle that phase of the ar
gument, and again Mr. Dohrmann
â  I Bylngton to be fair and per
mit the merchants of the city to obtain
the much sought benefit. Byington
would give iv> promise.
"Well, then," Interjected L. V. Merle,
repres< ntins the Sixth Street Improve
meni Club, "then we will let the people
know who injured us if we lose. These
:â  chnicalities are unfair. The property
owners and merchants want this road.
They demand it. and you should not
i In the way."
There was a general discussion on
ornamental poles, but the amendment j
regarding them had been accepted and
th>- argument again turned to the j
amendment providing for flat rails. H.
H. Taylor, representing the local and
San .Mate,, interests of D. O. Mills, beg
ged Byington tÂ«> withdraw his amend -
an 1 permit the franchises t<> go [
through. "Byington, we represent
heavy interests in this city and Ban
.Mat...." he said, "and you ought to
consider that we have gome rights t"
be respected. We have in San Mateo I
interests amounting to J2.000.000. We
bury your Chinese there, we accept
your garbage, we have taken your
coursing and new are going to pet your
racing. After all of this don't you think j
we have some rights? Withdraw your
amendments and let us have a railroad
down near to us."
".\m'l 1 want to -make the sum.- re
quest," added A. S. Baldwin. "I want
to ask Supervisor Byington to stop bis
filibustering and unreasonable delay. I
mean by this nothing personal, of
course," < 1 > i i â¢ kly added the speaker, and
somebody suggested t" send for the
Mayor. "As representing the Macdon
ough estate," continued Baldwin* "I
ask foi consideration. 1 represent over
(1,000,000 in the district involved. This
property contributes between $25,000
and $30,000 a year to the support of the
city and we want the road. Supervisor
Byington, you should withdraw your
an i idments, which are merely ob
structions and unnecessary obstacles."
Mr. Baldwin then showed that the
people he represents want a spur line:
fr< .n I'< -st street and Grant avenue to
Bush to Sansome. Edgar Painter, rep- i
resenting the North Central [mprove
inent Club, assured Mr. Baldwin that
the California Hotel people objected]
strenuously to such a lini . Mr. Painter
â a as s" informed by Mayor Phelan.
"Then I am Borry to say," declared
Baldwin, "that Mayor I'helan is labor- j
ins under a very serious misapprehen
sion. The California Hotel wants that 1
road." Mr. Baldwin did nol explain, !
how< vet, why it was that such part "f ,
the franchise was n"t supported at the
meeting of the Street Committee a week
before. When he had concluded his ad- j
dress Edgar Painter also begged Bying- *
ti-ii to withdraw his objections, but
there was n<> answer from that official. ;
A suggestion was made to find Mayos
Phelan, l"it to no. purpose, as the
searchers said he was not in the City i
Hail.
After more desultory argument the
franchises were reported for adopt inn
in precisely the same condition as they
were when they came from the board.
An effort was made to recommend the
franchises <>n <Irant avenue and on
Battery street, but it failed. The com
mittee adjourned and Mayor Phelan
will have "ii Monday another oppor
tunity but little profit in continuing
his role of obstruction to advance his
political fortunes.
It is but fair to state in this connection
that Supervisor Byington was not In- his
actions yesterday a free :iÂ«ent. He was
acting under the dictation of the Mayor.

TALKING MACHINE ON
THE WITNESS STAND
.â ^r=> GRAPHOPHONE, one of the kind that grinds out
II \\ coon songs until they resemble nothing in the
II A world so much as the creaking of a broken-down
JJ \}> burn door of a windy night, was the star witness
yesterday morning In Police Judge Conlan's
i ourt. It took the stand, so to speak, in the preliminary
hearing of George Frederick Trueworthy. charged with
the murder of John Landsmann ,a sailor boy, In a street
fiKht Sunday, June 11. With Trueworthy, James Mon
aghan and Frank Bush were on hearing as accessories.
The advent.of the praphophonc in the case was purely
accidental, b'.Jt none the less it may prove the opening
wedge to thr new departure in up-to-date jurisprudence.
It came about, in the first instance, through the desiro of
the police to net on record as soon after the arrest, as
possible the statements of Trueworthy. Bush and Mon
aghan. The boys were in that dreaded "room 6" of the
Police Department, known as the "sweat box." where iTio
.1 are expected to exude pools of proof against
themselves through police pressure.
According to the testimony of Detective Cody no =uch
pressure was exercised on the boy prisoners. They were
asked, he testified, if they desived to make statements,
and answering in the affirmative a messenger was sent
for Stenographer Howard Vernon 'of Judge TreadwjU's
conn to take them down. Yernnn was particularly ousy
at Lhe time and sent His assistant, James Woodthorpe,
who is not a stenographer, but is a wonder on a grapho-
I md typi writer.
Woodthorpe explained the situation to the police, put
a clean-shaven wax cylinder into the machine, set tho
clockwork going, and gave the signal for Trueworthy to
fcx As the witness talked Woodthorpe repeated his
es Into the machine. The result was the 1200-word
waxen record placed on the whirling cylinder when Prose
cuting Attorney Charles A. Low got ready for tho
whirring witness.
"Call the ur.uihnphonp." he said.
"We object. '' said Attorney Pistol esi. who is noted for
objecting. He was seconded by his colleague in tha de
fense. W. P. Humphreys, who proceeded to argue the new
fancied witness out of court on the ground that no foun
dation had bppn laid for it. Despite the evidence of sub
stantial underpinning noticeable in its unsteady whirrings
LADY URSULA GROWS
OUT OF HER COSTUME
err ra IRS MARGARET ANGLTN. the fascinating leading lady of the
// \V/\\ Hf ' nrv Miller company, is In a sad way anG all on account of our
I )( \\ braclnÃ Hiril;tl< ' and her nun very excellent health. The fetching
li 1&> y> ;t( tifss has Taken on several pounds of the "too. '"" solid" Blnce she
faced our Invigorating winds and the hearty applause of the many
who admire her, but unfortunately the lady's wardrobe has noi expanded in
due proportion.
If green velvet were easy to "match" or if tailor? had the 'happy art of
totally concealing 'â¢expansions' Miss Anglin might' be a very happy young
woman. As it i.s the actress spends her moments between acting, and re-'
hearsing with h powerful magnifying lense searching for visible "seams"
and "gussets" and deploring the fashion of the early part of the eighteenth
century, which decrees that trousers and coat must be of the same material
and color.
On Monday evening Miss Amelia Is to play Lady Ursula in a comedy of
the same name from the gifted pen of Anthony Hope. In this play Miss Ang
lin. or rather the Lady Ursula, has ,m adventure which consists In masque
rading in male attire. And it th-i trousers of this same male attire thai are
the cause or all the lady's trouble. Miss Anglin played I'rsula with Sothcrn.
in New York and arranged to wear on Monday evening the same gowns and
costumes she showed In the Empire City. The costumes were sent for ,'md
arrived yesterday, and oh! the pity of it! Miss Anglin had grown stouter
and the trousers were tight. The suit, an elegant affair in green velvet, all
embroidered in gold, the lady would not lay aside, and bo started on a hunt
to match the green velvet. To her horror Miss Anslln discovered that there
are several hundred different shades of green. - lm j t i,; lt tnP particular verdant
shade she wanted WM not to be found. A tailor was called In und by me.ma
known only. to his artful self ho managed to find tiny strips of the. velvet
stowed away in the seams and hems, and this material he converted Into
"gussets." Now the trousers fit the actress, and no one would ever have sus
pected there, was a "gusset" in the whole thing if she herself, had not told it.
bis Honor ruled that the machine was all right, and the
crowd in the courtroom, the three boyish defendants,
court and counsel, all craned their nocks and listened for
the sharp metallic voice.
Just at this point, with interest at a tension. .Air.
Humphreys bethought him of another objection, entirely
legal, but evidently pound, which caused the withdrawal
temporarily of the witness on wheels until Detective Cody
had smoothed the way for it by the statement that ih'e
waxen remarks had not been forced from the boys.
"The position we take," Bald Judge I,ow just before
he ordered the clockwork started, â¢'is this: That a man
may utter language in any way he sees fit. If he has a
machine that can utter it he can use it. In other word?.
he doesn't need to utter it with his tongue to make it nf
force. There was a ease in point here not long ago where
a man touched a button on a machine he had and it pro
duced vulgar language. AYe convicted that man of u<inff
vulgar language."
Woodtborpe, on a signal from the court, set tho phone
working. It creaked and it wheezed: it made noises like a
man drawing a rasp over a steel grating; it emitted
sounds from the tombs, and then, by fits and starts, it
squ.aked out into the listening courtroom the ragtime
statement of one of the actors in a tragedy. Stenog
rapher Frank Vernon, who can pepper a pigeon al any
angle md from any trap ever invented-, was against it.
His facile pencil, which has transfixed some of the
choicest bits of language that ever floated through a
Police Court, was at fault. He mad-, an ineffectual at
tempt to record the alternate rumblings and raspings of
the voice in the machine and failed. <);\o or two stabs at
the paper was all he made before his pencil wandered,
imbecile, over the virgin page.
The machine told In the voice of Woodthorpe and the
words Of th<- defendant that one of the boys, maybe Mon
aghan, maybe Bushâ Trueworthy could not tellâ had given
him a knife during the course of the fight. Then the ma
chine admitted for J?ush that he had given Trueworthy a
knife half an hour before the fight was ever thought of
It reeled off its p.-rfunetory quota of words gave a last
uncanny gasp ami a rusty whirr and stopped' Evervbodv
sat down and looked foolish. Several unimportant wit
nesses were examined and the case closed. Judge Conlan
gave notice that he would pass judgment to-morrow

There wag consternation among tho

Managing Deputy County clerk Joseph
Goddard was kept busy calming the host
of startled deputies under him. "As yet
1 do not know what will )>e done" sain
Mr. Goddard yesterday. "Mr. Deane will
arrive from the springs early to-morrow
morning. I will meet him at tho depot
and w< will go into consultation as to
what is hrst to be done. I do not care to
say what policy, Mr. Deane will follow
hut it isÂ»obvious thai the decision of the
Supreme C.nirt must lie followed to the
letter. No man wishes to work for noth

if the office is crippled the public must
suffer and litigation drag; hut no one j<
to blame Imt the lawmakers. Of course
the prisons may be emptied of criminals
"Wing to the inahiiity of the oflleo to keep

Auditor Wells Bald yesterday: "I don't

Tendered its decision. 1 shall consult with

BUCKLEY IS HERE TO
HELP THE RAILROAD
Herrin Now Seeks Control of the
Democratic Machine.
Republican Fight Against Burns, the Bosses and the
Franchise Grab Compels (he Southern Pacific to
Change Its Political Base.
The men who supported D. M. Burns
at Sacramento last winter are confident
that Governor Gage will call an extra
session of the Legislature. They com
ment with pleasure on the recent ap
pointment of General Barnes to the
board of university regents, holding
that the general's retirement from the
Senatorial contest has thus been re
assured. They note with apparent de
light also that U. S. Giant Jr. of San
Diego is no lunger in the field us an
aspirant for Senatorial honors.
Among the candidates who were sus
tained by votes until the finish of the
regular session Irving M. Scott and D.
M. Burns remain. The politicians who
are now handling the wires for the
Mexican are exalting Irving M. Scoti
as the ideal Republican candidate for
first Mayor of San Francisco under the
new charter. Burns himself is boom
ing Scott and saying all sorts of com
plimentary things about the ship
builder, but he is not quoted as prais
ing Scott's friend and political man
ager, ex-Mayor Ellert.
The obvious purpose of this plowing
admiration for Scott is to eliminate his
candidacy from- the next Senatorial
contest. The backers of the Mexican
want to go to the Governor with some
kind of an assurance that the Legisla
ture, if convened in extra session,
would elect a Senator. The legislators
who are so eager for an extra session
may not know that Irving M. Scott was
C. P. Huntington's second choice at
the regular session last winter, but
Burns is surely advised of that fact.
The Mexican may apprehend danger of
a change in the railroad programme by
which Scott shall be pressed forward as
the first choice of Huntington.
The Southern Pacific is in politics now
as it never was before. The Call is in
possession of important information,
which is deemed authentic, that th(>
managers of the railroad have brought
Buckley back to the field of municipal
politics in order to defeat Mayor
Phelan's renomination by the Demo
crats and gain possession of the Demo
cratic works. The railroad bosses,
aided by a piiant Governor, sought at
Sacramento to debauch the Republican
party and secure the election of D. M.
Burns to the T'nited States Senate. The
railroad busses, aided by the Governor
and supported by members of the Leg
islature who were false to pledges made
to the people, sought to reorganize the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners
so that patronage to the extent of $300,
--000 could be used to support the failing
political fortunes of the Mexican. The
stalwart and incorruptible Republicans
of the Legislature, sustained by The
Call, exposed and defeated the corrupt
scheme.
The railroad bosses sought to cor
rupt the Republican Supervisors of San
Francisco in order to obtain the grant
of a great franchise, but the scheme
was defeated by the integrity of the
Republican minority and the vigilance
of The Call.
Huntington, Herrin, Burns and Gage
have been baffled in their designs to
use the Republican party to enrich the
railroad corporation and extend its
power over the people. The Southern
Pacific therefore plans a chang- of
base, and expects to aei.omplish through
the Democratic party the purposes
which it failed to achieve through the
Republican organization.
The clumsy hand of Herrin is shown
in Democratic manipulation and it will
be again exhibited. His political meth
i-ds are awkward. No skill or dexterity
1s shown in the common, ordinary
movements. As a political manipu
lator Phclan ran give him points. It
may not be generally known, but it is
a fact, nevertheless, that Phelan is n>>
longer a novice in politics. Ho gains
wisdom by experience. He is not a
Bourbon, who learns nothing and for
gets nothing. No doubt he is fully ap
prised of the railroad scheme t<> get
possession of the Democratic works and
is watching for signs of a railroad cam
paign to seize the Nrn-Partisan con
vention through the operations of the
primary law.
It would nÂ«>t surprise the vigilant and
wary if Buckley should combine with
the corrupt elements of the Republican
machine to gain control of the N<rn-
Partisan convention and use that powÂ«r
to 'grant or withhold indorsement of the
nominees of some other convention. In
order to obtain control of the Board of
Supervisors the railrond bosses may
consent id accept Phelan, but the pro
gramme as it stands now is to defeat
his renominatibn. The railroad workers
may wrest control of the Democratic
convention from the Committee of One
Hundred, but should the fight be made
on this line the scheme to seize the
Non-Partisan convention ' would be
abandoned..
Under the primary law the elector^
can vote for delegates to one convent Â»
tion only. Owing to the discontent W
among the masses of the Democratic
party, caused by the gross usurpation
of authority by the Committee of One
Hundred, it would be an easy task for
the independent and Buckley clubs to
combine and elect a majority of dele
gates to the Democratic nominating
convention. The probability of such a
movement has not escaped the observa
tion of Mayor Phelan. He is not put
ting all of his eggs in one "litieal bas
ket. The resolutions indorsing him,
which are presented to every independ
ent club, are carefully prepared and
typewritten in advance of their intro
duction. Should the Committee of One
Hundred fail to capture the convention
Phelan would not be without a follow
ing.
The Republicans have the advantage
of position in the local campaign. Last
fall the party pledged the people that
the railroad should not rule in this
State. The pledge has been fulfilled at
the sacrifice.of a Republican vote in the
United States Senate, but the Republi
cans have kept faith with the people,
despite the falling down of the Gov
ernor and the Railroad Commissioners.
The Governor, elected by a great ma
jority of the people, has permitted the
patronage of his office to be used to
strengthen the railroad's power, but
this desertion shows individual rather
than party weakness. A weak party
would have followed him for the sake
of the political plunder. In the [oral
campaign the Republican leaders can Â«'
go before the voters with this record of
devotion to the public service and ob
tain a vote of confidence from the
masses. A popular local convention, so
large that each precinct may be repre
sented by a delegate, would keep the
party close to the people and remove
danger of corporate control. Good men
throughout the city, desiring to rebuke
the pretensions of Burns and resent the
intrusion of the railroad in polities,
may join in the work of electing dele
gates to the Republican convention.
The railroad bosses, the professional
politicians, the strikers and the horde
of office-seekers are now bent on seiz
ing the Democratic machine.
