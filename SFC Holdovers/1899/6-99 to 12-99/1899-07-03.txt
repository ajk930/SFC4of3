The fact that Otis has reduced to two |
regiments the number to be organized

to fill them up shows that he has had
much difficulty to obtain re-enlistments
of volunteers. It is estimated that he
has obtained only 800 men, not enough
to form one regiment.
Under instructions to recruiting of

volunteers there will be no restrictions

SOUTHERN FILIPINOS
ANXIOUS FOR PEACE
MANILA, July 2.â Professor J. G.

visory Commission for the Philippines,

three weeks' trip In the southern Isl
lands. He tak^s an entirely hopeful
view of the genera! conditions there.

chiefly anxious to be undisturbed. The
president of the town of Sant" Nicolas,
in the island of Cebu, said to Mr.
Schurman: "We want peace, food and
prosperity. W<- do rmt wish to tight.
We would be neutral."
The presideni of the commission
thinks this declaration fairly expn
the sentiments of the people in thp
southern islands of the archipelago-.
Many of the towns there an- in the
hands of small bands of Tagalos, and
the people fear to indorse American;
rule until they are certain that Aguin
aldo will be beaten. Let them once be
convinced of this and the allegiance of
the southern islands, Mr. Schurman
thinks, can be secured by diplomacy.
The United States gunboat Benning
ton took Mr. Schurman to Mindanao
and the islands of the Sulu and Visayan
groups.
Mr. Schurman traveled through the
island of Negros with Colonel Smith I
and a party of natives. In several of
the principal towns lie was tendered
banquets and had an hour's conference
with the young Sultan of Sulu. who
received him in the royal audience
chamber, surrounded by a body-guard
of fierce-looking Oros.
Mr. Schurman told the Sultan that
the United States had acquired the
sovereignty of the Philippines from
Spain, but had no wish to subjugate the
population nor interfere with their cus
tom.'; or religions. On the contrary,;
the great desire of the American Gov
ernment was to help the people, of the
islands to develop their country. The
Sultan replied that he earnestly de- i
sired peace, and was anxious to con
tinue the existing treaties.
On the return voyage the president of
the commission visited the town cf Bor- !
neo, capital of British North Borneo,
where he was cordially recieved by the
British officials, who afforded him
every facility in his study of the local
government and the customs of the
people. The population he found much
like that of the southern Philippine Isl
ands. The government at present is in
a lather elementary state, but a more !
complete organization is being devel- |

Senor Llorente, who is considered the
must influential nati\e tn Cebu, said to
Mr. Schurman: "I like the- American

arrived in .Manila and taken his seat

CHAMBERS MAY SOON
BE CALLED HOME.
JUSTICE CHAMBERS' Press Bu- j
reau has again been discredited by
the publication this morning of a
Berlin dispatch stating that the
Cologne Oazette has h special from
Apia dated June 26 to the effect that
Malietoa Tanu will soon bo transport
ed to the Fiji Islands, and that Cham
bers will soon fallow Maxse and l:ose,
who are now on their way home. The j
Cologne Gazette has scored what is
called in newspaper parlance a "scoop"
over < 'hambers' Press Bureau, for the j
Judge has not sent out either of these
facts. The Call has also "scooped" the
Judge, for it predicted both events in j
its Samoan letter published on July L
The correspondent of the Cologne Ga- !
zette now at Samoa is Dr. Genthe, a
cultured gentleman having the title
of Ph.D. from a German university.
As representing- an official organ of
the German Government much credii
attaches to his statements, and they
may be taken as straws indicating the;
further action of the commission. Evi
dently Tanu has refused t' : beep his
part of the compact and remove from ;
Mulinuu with his followers. The j
American and German Commissioners
have insisted upc-n this, but the Eng
lish Commissioner not standing with
them has given them courage to- resist ,
the order, and it would seem as if the |
English Commissioner had been com- j
p [led to reluctantly consent to his de- i
portation.
As an instance of the unreliability <rf
the reports sent out from Apia, atten- j
tion may be called to an address to
American citizens in Samoa, purporting
to have been issued by United States
Consul General Luther W. Osborn
shortly after the overthrow of the Su- |
preme Court. This address WBJB patri
otic in tone, eulogized Judge Chambers,
stated that in America any one who
criti< Used the Supreme Court would be
severely punished, and closed with the i
exclamation: "American's, stand by '
the flag!" The address was sent out I
and published throughout the United
States; but Mr. Osborn says that be did ;
rot sign- it. nor did ho dictate a word
of it. The r'"-sr knowledge lie had of the ;
existence of the address and its signa- j
ture was received from one of the !
newspapers in which the article con- j
taining them was published. Thus were i
Osborns name and influence used {
to support the dignity of the Supreme |
Court of Samoa.
Later on, when Osborn incurred the
ill will of Chambers and others by re
fusing to perform some act which they
required of him to further their
schemes, he was charged in an article.
which was publishe". extensively, with
having refused while acting as presi
dent of the .Municipal Council to pay
the salary of young King Tanu for the
month of January, as ordered by the
Berlin treaty, and proceedings were
BY W. E. WILLIAMSON.
I instituted in the Supreme Court to com
pel the payment. The dispatch also
stated that Mr. Osborn was the only
one of the American or British officials
"who would have anything to do with
the German Consul General." Mr. <Js
born states that the whole dispatch was
misleading, and was intended to be B >â¢
"My duties as diplomatic and con
sular representative of the United
States and as acting president." said
Mr. Osborn, "required me to have daily
intercourse, by letter and otherwise,
with the other consular representatives
and treaty officials. It would be a pe
culiar representative of a great na
tion who. on account of a difference of
opinion on certain political questions,
'would not have anything to do 1 with
his colleagues and others with whom
he must transact business. Possibly
very much which will ever be regret
ted iiii^ht have been averted if others
had not refused to have anything to
do 1 with certain other officials with
whom it was their duty to co-operate.
"The Berlin treaty contains nothing
whatever upon the subject of the
Kings salary, either as to amount, or
time or manner of payment For the
past three years there has been a con
tinual dispute as to the amount which
the King should receive. For a while
he was paid SISOO a year, and at other
times only one-third of that amount.
The reports are very imperfect, and
do not show clearly just how or when
the amount of the salary was fixed and
determined. In April last, after the
young King had been installed by the
military authorities, the Question of
salary and amount and manner of pay
ment again came up. While I was act
ing as president the three consular rep
resentatives were in reality responsible
for my acts and for any disbursements
that 1 might make. 1 asked the joint
action of the three representatives, but
they could not agree, the German con
sul contending that no disputed claim
should be paid pending the arrival of
tin High Commission. In order that a
matter which had been a subject of
contention for years might be settled. I
suggested to the solicitor for the King
that hi file in the Supreme Court a
Short bill asking a judicial determina
tion of the question. The bill was filed,
and 1 answered the same without sum
mons, interposing no obstructions, but
simply asking that the disputed ques
tion be settled that 1 might be justified
in the payment of the claim and that
no liability of myself or colleagues
might be "incurred. The proceeding
was in reality for the benefit of the
King and the Government, and no other
fours.- could have been pursued by a
prudent and careful official."
During the troubles Consul General
Osborn received a communication from
an American citizen residing in Apia,
who was suspected of being in sym
pathy with Mataafa, protesting against
the continued looting and destruction
Of bis property by Tanu natives, and
asking him to communicate the matter
to the admiral with the request that the
latter take some measures to put a stop
to this pillaging and destruction of his i
property. Consul Osborn acknowledged I
in writing the receipt of the communi
cation, and was seen by one of the
English guard to hand the answer t<> a
native for delivery. This native was
watched and arrested after the delivery
of the note, and thÂ»- occurrence was re
ported by Captain Sturdee t<> Admiral
Kautz. The admiral at crhce sum
moned the American Consul General to
the flagship and warned him against
having any further communication !
with the American above mentioned.
Consul Osborn was indignant at this I
high-handed proceeding, and stated that I
he had but performed an official duty.
| and would certainly repeat the act If
occasion required. He assured Ad
i miral Kautz that he represented the
' American Government in his official
! capacity as Consul General, and was!
responsible for his acts to his Govern- j
ment alone.
These incidents, showing thr way ;
Consul Osbbra has been misrepresented [
\ and insulted by officials from whom he ]
dared to differ have never before been
published. They are related as told by
the Consul General himself, and their
truth cannot be questioned.

Chinese Student of Yale
Tortured by Order of

VICTORIA, R. C July 2.â A
strange story ->f the decoying of
jn Americanized Chinese doctor
from Yale Kniversity to China's j
capital, where he was imprisoned ,
'and tortured before his release was ob- :
i tamed by an American resident of Pc- ;
1 king, is told in copies <'f the North
China Daily Xews received by the last :
! Oriental liners.
According to the Peking correspond- j
ent of the Chinese paper Dr. Yung;
'' Wing. LL. D., of Yale University was
studying medicine and law at Yale up J
to three months age., when he was vis- \
ited by a Chinese, with whom he left j
Yale for the West. It has since been
learned that this Chinese brought to ;
Dr. Yung Wing letters and papers from

position under the Imperial Chinese j
Government, providing he accompanied |

The doctor accepted the position and

As soon as the two Chinese were put

SITUATION IN BELGIUM
EXTREMELY GRAVE.
The Government Will Have Great
Difficulty in Preventing a
Revolution.
BRUSSELS, July 2.â The situation in
; Belgium to-night is regarded as ex
tremely grayÂ«? Socialists und Radicals
cem posing the opposition now demand
j universal suffrage and will be satisfied
i with nothing else. All depends on what
i the Government will do on Tuesday. If
it fails to bring in a bill granting uni
j versal suffrage it is feared that there
will be a revolution, with consequences
of a far-reaching character.
The Government is in a difficult posi
tion. By opposing the demand for uni
versal suffrage it may bring about a
revolution which would sweep away
the monarchy. On the other hand, if
it gives in an appeal for universal suf
frage would apparently result in such
a large Socialist-Republican majority
in the legislative body that the mon
archy would be just as much in danger.
In "addition to all this the workmen
in populous industrial towns in Bel
gium have decided to go out on a strike
if their demands are not yielded to on
Tuesday. Active members of the revo
. lutionary party are collecting arms and
ammunition and are fully prepared to
I support their claims by force.
To-day there was no serious disturb
ance in Brussels itself, but serious
I events occurred in several places in the
provinces. Socialists assembled to-day
i in ereat numbers in the park, where a
I regimental band was to play during
the afternoon. Socialists gathered
! around and sang the "â¢Marseillaise"'
' with such vigor that the music of the
i band could not be heard. The police
j tried to intervene, but had to yield to
i superior numbers, and the Socialists
I carried the day. Socialists to the num
ber of 700 or 800 then formed a proces
â  sion and marched through the streets
| to the Maison dv Peuple, singing the
â .Marseillaise" as they went. At the
Maison dv Peuple a meeting was held,
at which resolutions for universal
! suffrage were passed with great en
i thusiasm.
The most serious disorders were
those which took place at Alost. A
meeting was addressed there by Abbe
Daens, a Catholic socialist, who by

it was given out by the local authori
ties that Dr. Yung Wins was impris
oned because he was believed to have
had some relations in. or connection
with, the late un-fortunate reform
movement, but this was only a blind,
for it afterward de eloped that the
doctor was imprisoned by impecunious
Prince Ching so that he might extort
money from the doctor's friends, who.
it w;is thought, would be ready to pay
heavily to deliver him from imprison
ment and torture or death.
This scheme was nipped in the bud by
an American resident of Peking, to
whom the doctor managed to send word
of his predicament by bribing one of
his keepers. The American, who was
dressed in Chinese costume, went to
the temple, and by threats, accom
panied by the persuasion of a. pointed
revolver, obtained Dr. Yung Wing's re
lease. From the temple he took him to
Tientsin by train, whence the unfor
tunate doctor took a steamer for
Japan. He probably will return to
America.
reason of his attitude in the present
complications has been repudiated by
the Catholic party. An attempt to
Ureftk -p the meeting: by the police was

charged the crowd with extraordinary
violence and many of the people were
I seriously injured. The popular feeling:
at Alost is in such ;in excited state
that further serious trouble is feared
to-night or to-morrow. Abbe Daen's
brother has been arested.
Incidents of extre-mp gravity occur
red at Liege. A review of the civic
guards took place to-day, and while It
' was in progress a procession composed
| of Socialists and Radicals marched past
the troops singing the "Marseillaise"
and '"Carmagnole."' While the Socialists
were marching the civic guards re
mained unmoved, but afterward they
marched in uniform to the celebrated
Maison dv Pouple of Liege, thus dem
onstrating their entire sympathy with
the Socialist party.
A monster meeting of- miners was
held at Mons, at which resolutions in
favor of going out on a strike in the
event of the Government's refusing to
give them satisfaction on electoral
questions on Tuesday were passed.
This means that from 25,000 to 30,000
men are preparing to go on a strike.
Mass meetings were held in Verviers
to-day by all the workmen's associa
tions of that district, and a general
strike was agreed on should the Gov
ernment refuse to give way.
Some 20,000 Radicals and Socialists
held a demonstration in Antwerp last
evening. The Government was very
hotly attacked, and there was a feel
i ing of hostility to the Government in
I general. Order was maintained by the
| police. The Burgomasters of Brussels,

clared his firm belief that the partition of China among the powers of
Europe is only a question of time. Be Bays: "What Japan desires for
her own sake and China's is that China's Integrity should be preserved,
nnd that she should become progressive. But it must bo confessed that
China haa fallen Into a condition offering little hope of these things be
in* accomplished. I think we shall Boon find ourselves separated from
lhe Â, â  ,r Europe by only a narrow strip of water. Japan must
ta k e her own protection, making: every effort to maintain a
r ., tl , . Â£ equal to that <>f ihe countries by which she will be con
fronted."
Official Japan believes Ito is right, he having recently visited China
on a tour of inspection.
GROWERS FIX THE
PRICE OF PEACHES
Initial Step Taken at
Healdsburg.
i
Social Dispatch to The Call.
HEALDSBURG, July 2.â The meeting j
of fruit growers held in Healdsburj yes- j
terday was largely attended by growers j
from difft>rent parts of the county, i
Jonathan Roberts of Santa Rosa, presl- j
dent of tho Sonoma County Horticultural j
Society, acted as president of the meet- j
Ing and P. W. i 'ooke as secretary.
The principal speaker was F. Butler of j
Fprestvllle. lie said that last year the j
canneries paid a great deal better prices j
than they were now offering and pros- i
pered. The market to-day was practical- ;
ly .bare of canned and dried, fruit, and
the trade was offering 9 to 10% cents for
bleached unpeeled peaches. The crop was j
extremely short in all parts of the United :
States other than California, and in
many portions of California as well.
Ninety per cent of the canneries of the f
State "had e.mibinod to regulate the prices
of fruit. They had advanced their sell- |
ing price to 53 per cent over last year and
were trying to reduce the price paid to ;
the growers 33 1-3 per cent.
Mr Butler had no objection to this pro- |
ceeding on the part of the canneries, but i
ho claimed an equal right on the part of
the growers to organize to obtain remun
erative priens. He believed the demand
created for California dried and canned
frolts by the war in the Philippines would
Increase greatly during the next twelve
months and would be of moderate volume ,
for upward of three yean?.
The growers could reach 'hat market i
Independent of the canneries. He urged j
the growers to stand together for a lair
figure; and they would get it. ITT 1 would
dry his peaches unless he obtained $30 per j
ton' for them. ;_,
Among the other speakers were: A. R.
Gallaway of Dry Creek Valley, J. E.
Motzcrer nd W. V. Griffith of Geyser
ville.^Mr. Mack of Santa Rosa. George
Sloeum. D. P. Cullom, Rev. Joe Waldrop.
and William Floyd of Healdsburg and i
Mr. Griges of Fulton.
Th. foflowin preamble and resolutions j
were adopted: .
Whereas, The canning season la near at hand, j
buyers having already entered the held, and j
whereas the supply of peaches Is far short of ,
the average yield of the country, with the eup
ply of last year's stock well exhausted and new !
market developing; and whereas, the packers |
have combined and materially advanced the \
prices of canned poods. Therefore, be It
Resolved. That we. the producers, fix the mini- j
mum price for canning sizes of freestone j
peaches at t"'> por .ton. and of clinkstone at. $30 |
per ton. And the committee further recom- j
mends that committees be appointed to clrcu- I
late forms nf agreement among the fruit-prow- ,
ers of the county to secure unity of action. We
also unre similar action among the producers
of other fruit district.", and we further recom
mend that an executive committee of seven be
appointed to look after the Interests of the ,
fruit-growers In this country. J
The resolutions were unanimously j
adopt* and all present signed the agree- !
mem to sell at not less than $25 and $30.
ThÂ» following executive committee was
chosen: F. Butler of Forestville (chair
man), A. R. Gallaway, D. I. Cullom. W. |
J. McClendon and F. W. Cooke (sccre- I
tary) of Healdsburg. J. E. Metzger of j

AGUIRRE AND EDGAR
ALREADY CLASHING
Violation of a Prison Rule Causes
a Rise in Prophetic
Stock.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. July The j
expected clash between "Warden Aguirre j
and Captain of the Yard Edgar has i
come sooner than was expected. It was |
not a momentous event, 'but such as it j
was it shows pretty clearly that the
prophecies of the wiseacres are in a fair
way to be fulfilled at no distant date.
One of the strictest rules of the prison j
is that in no case shall a . member of I
the fair sex be allowed Inside the walls j
except to act as nurse for a sick person, j
James R. Russell, the new captain of
the guard, was Ignorant of this rule and I
to-day permitted several ladies, accom- !
panJed by their escorts, to go through j
the gates. The party was met by Cap- \
tain Edgar, who nearly fainted at so
flagrant a breach of the rules. Holding j
the par! in the office, a courier was |
sent to Aguirro and a consultation held.
The Warden was at first inclined to up- i
hold Russell, and would have done so !
had not Edgar reminded him in unmistak- I
able ten that the rule had been made i
by the Prison Directors and not by the i
Warden. As Aguirre already has as i
much as 'he wants of the directors he
finally concluded to abide by the rule,
and with many apologies the ladies were
asked to return. - Â»
Warden A guirre denies that this oc
currence took place. In view of the fact
that he has boasted that no paper shall
have any prison news unless he Bays so,
his statement in this instance is deemed
important.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT. July 2.â The Sabbath was
! strictly observed to-day on the Christian i
j Endeavor grounds, the site of the Inter- I
I national '99 Convention. !
Some of the concessionaires who had i
! been slow In getting their tents and equip- j
I ments in place asked permission to work j
j Sunday, but consent was promptly re-
I fused by John Strong:, chairman of tho I
i general "99 committee, who stated that j
: nothing inconsistent with the Christian j
I principles would be allowed on the j
j grounds. Work of necessity, such as pre- I
paring and serving- meals, will of course |
! be permitted next Sunday, as on other j
; days.
All the local committees will this week |
â  transfer their quarters from the thir
i teenth floor of the Majestic building to
' the encampment grounds. The undulat- j
; ing: canvas roofs and Buttering flags of j
I the newly arisen white city, which from J
; Wednesday until the following Tuesday ;
I will be a center of religious enthusiasm, i
I are now plainly visible from the office of
I the general committee, two miles away, j
Tents Endeavor and Williston, the two j
big twin canvas auditoriums, are com- j
plete, save for the decorating, which is j
in progress. :
The predominating colors will.be crim
son and white, the C. K. colors. Huge!
streamers will be stretched to the center
and to the sides of the roof, destroying
the bare effect of the canvas. There are j
ninety-six of the streamers at the stage |
end, "forty-eight at the opposite or en- ;
tranca end and seventy-two along the â 
sides, making a total of 211 of these wide
crimson and white ribbons, radiating as
far as the wall? of the tents. The stage |
will present a ceiling of color and the
bunting will come to a point at the top
of the dome.
The mammoth stage will be done in
white, relieved by festoons of crimson,
and the speaker's stand will be adorn* by
Old Glory and the Union Jack. Suspended
from the center above the speaker's stand
is an electrical device showing the Chris- ;
tian Endeavor monogram. This will be ;
draped on either side with American and :
I British flags. On each of the quarter
] poles there will be banners 4x6 feet in size ;
i in honor of each State in the Union; on \
i the reverse of these will be banners of all 'â 
\ nations in which the Christian Endeavor
f movement has obtained a foothold. Out- j
! side, running down the halyards attached !
I to the three huge center poles and below j
j the tent burgees and stars and stripes,
will be flown a myriad of Dags of all na
tions, the three lines of ensigns reaching
nearly to the ground. Over â *"" flags will
be used In the decsration of the two main j
tents, not counting innumerable small
ones that will adorn the wall poles.
Tents Endeavor and Willlston each has i
a comfortable seating capacity of 10,000, j
; and the platforms each Beat 1000 including
choirs of 500 voices. The speaker's plat- j
! form projects outward from the main j
i stage. Around this projection are tables |
: and chairs assigned to the use of 10") t
working reporters. The usher system has j
! been admirably perfected and confusion j
: will be hardly possible. Non-delegates
will be admitted after certain hours, i
Headquarters, bicycle, information, press j
and ladies' tents are all ample and conve- [
niently arranged. All space designed for I
| restaurant and refreshment tents, etc., is, ,
occupied.
: A rapid street car service is expectd to j
; be a feature. The Woodward-avenue line, \
I running nearest to the grounds, will run
1 cars every twenty seconds. There will be i
i a one-minute service "â . the Lake avenue j
and two-minute cars on other adjacent !
lines. The railroads have established a j
joint agency in Philharmonic Hall, where
all return tickets must be marked and |
where tickets must be deposited in return
for checks if extensions art- desired.
Names of all ticket holders will be re- j
corded and pass agents are hopeful of
largely frustrating ticket brokers' i
| schemes.
Ample accommodations have been se
cured for 40,000; although the number of
B will probably be much
less than that number, others who aro
attracted by the low rates of fare can

COEUR D'ALENES STRIKE
AS A NATIONAL ISSUE
NEW YORK, July 2.â Ex-General Mas
ter Workman James R. .Sovereign of the
Knights of Labor to-day visited the Cen
tral I Union and Btlrred up ex
cit< ment among the delegates on the ac
: G< al Merriam in the Coeur
d'Alene district. He said he had come as
tative of the organized miners
of the Rocky Mountain mines, and ha
thanked the New'-Yorjj unions for the pro
â : â  â  had maJde against th
q that had been alleged had existed.
Mr. Sovereign threw the responsibility
for all the troubles in that mining dis
trict upon John D. Rockefeller, who, he
said, owned the Bunker Hill Company and
: >iied other mines. The manager < t
the mines, he said, had an agr< emeat with
â  inera thai when the prices of ailver
hey would pay thorn
union rates of wages. The prices did
rise, and when the rn<-n ask'-d for thi ad
vanced*rates they wen refused. Th
organized and the managers began dis
charging them in block? of ten and
twenty.
The ex-general master workman then
ribed the gathering of the men, their
taking possession of a train and loading
11 v tii MOO pounds of dynamite with which
they blew up some of the works, "it was
the grandest pyrotechnic display that I
knew of in mj life," he continued,
"but it had not been ordered or pie
by the union, it was Â£he ni< n themselves
who had been goaded to desperation.
"We propose to make a national issue
of this, because it involves national Inter
ests. There may be Jealousies and rival
ries amonf? trades unions, but when the
enemy turns the gatlingr guns against one
union it will turn them against all unions,
and we are of fighting blood out West and
we will fight it out there."

DETROIT, July 2.â Governor Pln
gree to-night dispatched a letter to
Secretary Algrer, brought out by criti
cisms of the Secretary and numerous
comments recently published concern
ing the agreement made by the Gover
nor to support the Secretary in his
campaign for' the Tnitfd States Sena
torship. The letter is. as follows:
My Dear General: I subscribe to a clip
ping 1 bureau and 1 have, within the past
few days been receiving- large numbers of
clippings from newspapers published in
every part of the country, containing
what purports to be an interview with me
in which criticisms of the present admin
istration are put in my mouth. I am as
tonished at the circulation and credence
which this alleged interview has received.
I would not take cognizance of it, were
it not for the fact that it seems to have
been so widely circulated and also for the
reason that there are many people who
have yet to learn that what is termed po
litical news and opinion are as unreliable,
inaccurate and prejudiced as the newspa
per man's ingenuity .and cunning can
make them. It did not seem to me neces
sary to deny the interview. 1 would not
give it any thought whatever, were it not
for the fact that it is made the basis of a
petty and mean-spirited attack upon you,
which is, however, but a natural product
of small-caliber intellects.
The interview to which I have re
ferred is a pure fabrication. There is
not a single sentence in it which was
spoken by me. It is the invention of a
reporter, who may or may not have been
acting under instructions from his chief.
I have at different times expressed my
opinion of the necessity for the war in
the Philippines. I have, In common with
thousands of others in the country, dis
approved of it, and have had no hesita
tion in giving my views whenever I have
hern asked for them. 1 voted for Mr-
Kinley, and I have had no cause what
ever to regret it. If he is a candidate
again' I will take pleasure In giving him
my support.
It has always seemed to me that the
criticism by New York newspapers of
the management of the War Department
has amounted to a condemnation not only
of the President, but of the entire <';ii>
lnet. It Is well known that no important
step Is taken without the concurrence, or
at least the advice of the President and
the Cabinet. I am well satisfied that the
attack up<>n the War Department is noth
ing but a cunningly conceived plot to
create a vacancy to be tilled by a New
fork politician. Already New York
newspapers are discussing the distribu
tion of the patronage of the department.
The other papers of the country have
pimply repented what the New York
newspapers have said.
i>f course, it is not surprising that
Senator McMillan and his "me, too,"
Senator Burrows, have joined in the con
t< mptlble scheme to discredit and defame
the war Department. In so far as the al
leged "alliance" with you is concerned, I
can freely and frankly say that none has
been made. As you are already aware, I
simply proffererd you my support in your
candidacy for rutted States Senator, and
only wanted to know whether you were In
favor of an amendment to the the Consti
tution of the I'nited States permitting
the election of United States Senators by
direct vote of the people. I was glad to
i" advised by you that you favored the
restriction of "trusts." but neither of
these things was made the condition of
my support. In common with thousands
of other Michigan people, 1 merely of
fered to assist you.
If anything, 1 have profited by it politi
cally, because the American people de
test cowardly methods of lighting.
The language which is attributed to me
in the false interview in which I am made
to criticize and abuse the administration
should have conuemned the interview as
a fabrication 'at sight. But even more ab
surd is the statement made by the preM
that I was an avowed candidate for the
Republican nomination for President at
the next national convention; that you
have made an alliance with me. and that,
therefore, you have practically deciar.-ci
your opposition to President MeKinl-y
v.nd should retire from his Cabinet. i if
course such a statement Is too silly to be
entitled to serious attention, It Is surfi
cient to say to you that I have not ami
never did entertain the remotest intention
of becoming a candidate for the Presi
dency. The story is only another inven
tion of Michigan newspapers.
I think the time is not far distant when
public opinion will compel newspapers to
l>e fair and decent in their treatment of
men In public life. T'ntil it does, 1 am con
vinced that the only course to pursue is to
ignore their malicious attacks. Attempts
to correct their reports only result in pro
voking a more liberal outpouring of edi
torial venom. After all. it is well to res
member that a newspaper represents the
opinion of only one man. and that his
opinion' is undoubtedly Influenced by every
motive except a desire to do full justice
The time is not far distant when the peo
ple will awake to this fact, and when they
do ,iere will be a radical change in the
policy of conducting the newspapers of
the country, and especially In their treat
ment of public men.
Regretting if the unwarrantable ..ber
ties taken with mv name have <-qused
you any embarrassment. I am, yours very
sincerely,

Democratic leaders. Including VL F. Dun
lap, candidate fur State Treasurer during
the last campaign; ex-Congressman Hln

Mr. Bryan arrived in Chicago to-day on
his way from Aberdeen, N. !Â».. to Barnes
ville, Ga., where he delivers an address
July 4. He was met by Mr. Thurman and
Mr. Ditty, who had come from Columbus
for that purpose, and together with the
Illinois leaders took dinner at the Sher
man House. At the conclusion of the j
dinner a conference was h<-!d, which last- i
ed the greater part of the afternoon. None j
of the local Democratic leaders were pres- j
ent. Mr. Bryan denied there was
political slgnitioance In the meeting:.
"I am on my way from Aberdeen to
Barnesvllle, Ga.," he said. "Some of my
friends knew 1 would be passing through
the city to-day and were here to meet
me,"
Samuel B. Cook of the ways and means
committee states that the national politi

Stockton Forty-Nmer Dies.
STOCKTON. July 2.â News has been re
ceived here of the death last Friday of
Henry Hodgkins in Cheltenham, England.
Hodgkins was a pioneer of San Joaquin
County, having engaged In the butcher
business here In 1849. He built many of
the ttrst brick blocks In Stockton, and his
wealth Increased so rapidly that In 1858 he
retired from active business and returned
to his old home. Since then he has vis
ited Stockton for a few months every two
years and always kept up his old friend
ships. Recently he deeded $150,0)0 worth
of property to two of his cons, and they
are to become permanent residents of this
city.
THE AUTOMOBILE
IS STRENGTHENED
Extra Precautions Cause a Brief
Delay in tr;e Start flcross
the Continent.
NEW YORK, July 2.â Changes are being made to prepare the auto
mobile, which, under the management of The San Francisco call
and the New York Herald, is to run to San Francisco, for climt>
ing and descending steep mountain roads. Advices from Den
ver to the effect that an automobile built for the good roads or
the East would have little chance of getting through the Rocky Moun
tains have led the makers to put on a much stronger brake than was
first provided and to strengthen several of the working parts of the mo
tor. When these alterations are completed the vehicle will be tested on_
the most precipitous hills that can be found in Connecticut, and when
all is in readiness The Call and the Herald will announce trie day and
hour selected for the start. The officers of the company that is making
the automobile realize that the journey will be one of the most trying
that could be devised and are making a special effort to guard against
breakdowns.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis were greatly disappointed at being delayed in
starting on their tour. They are both confident that the trip can be
made, and are determined to be the first to accomplish it. Mr. Davis'
mail has increased considerably since the announcement of his inten
tion of crossing the continent in a self-propelled touring cart. Some of
the letters contain advice as to roads and suggestions deemed import
ant by the writers, while others are from cranks, who predict dire
calamities unless their advice is followed. Mr. Davis has also been
offered a lamp that never goes out, bells that ring automatically, patent
cleaning and oiling compounds, and any number of devices to patch
"punctured tires. As there Is barely room in the carriage for toilet ar
ticles and clothing all donations from manufacturing concerns have
been declined.
NEW USE FOR
MOVING PICTURES
Department of Agricu!-
ture's Experiments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 2.-The Agricult
ural Department has pressed the moving
picture machine into the service of sci
ence. The Division of Vegetable Pathology
now has a device of this sort in operation
in one of its greenhouses, photographing
the growth of a small oak tree. The ma
chine works automatically, taking a pict
ure each hour. At night an electric light
is thrown into the circuit as the expos
ure is made. The mn chine has been run
ning about two weeks and will be kopt
going about two weeks longer on its pres
ent sul
When the series of pictures is com
pleted it will be possible to Teproduce
with the stereopticon the growth of the
plant from the time the first shoot ap
peared above ground until the tree is in
full leaf and a foot or more high. While
the oak tree's pictures are purely experi
mental to develop the capacity of the
machine, it Is intended to use the serial
photographs in watching the progress of
plant diseases, blights, insect parasites
and the like. The department hopes In
the near future to be able to lÂ«an to the
agricultural colleges and experiment sta
tions rolls of lantern-slide film to illus
trate certain of- the department's bulle
tins on these subjects.
It is pointed out that a lecturer before
a class of students could show In five
minutes the growth and seed distribu-
Umii of any noxious plant, such as the
Canadian thistle or the life history of an
insect pest so that It could be readily
recognized and eombatted on its first ap
pearance In a region, even though the
workers there had never seen it In actual
life.
In addition to the straight photo
graphic work expected of the new ma
chine, its designer intends to adapt i\ to
use with the X-ray so as to take pictures
of certain objects that otherwise would be
invisible. It is thought by the department
that a series of pictures of this sort taken
during the period of gestation would be
of value to stockraisers and might be
adapted to the use of the medical pro
fessi'iTi in certain lines of research.
ORGANIZING FOR A
GENERAL STRIKE
Chicago Packing-House Employes
Form a Union With This
Ei d in View.
CHICAGO, Joly 2.â There will he no
general strike of packing-house employes
at present. This much was decided on at
a mass meeting of discontented laborers
held this afternoon at Forty-third and
Wallace streets. The idea of a strike has
noj been given up altogether, but the
opinion prevailed that the time was not
yet ripe and thai the Interests of the men
would be best conserved by waiting until
an organisation could be perfected of suf
ficient strength to carry to a successful
conclusion any movement ol the kma.
The tirst move in that direction was
made at the meeting. An organization
known as the Packing Houw Employes
Union was formed and over 800 men he
came members. The avowed^ purpose of
the union is to fighi the packers, and it
was said openly at the meeting that as
Boon as the union was sufficiently strong
the packers would have to meet the de
mands of the men or a genera! strike
would take place. By September the
union is expected i" have a membership
of 15.000 and if by that time the demands
of the men for better working hours and
increased wages arÂ« noi complied with it
was Bald- a general tieup of tho packing
houses would be ordered. I" the mean
time all the employes were cautioned to
continue with their work. The names >f I
the officers of the new organisation were
k. pi secret.

GOOD YEAR FOR
MERCHANT MARINE
Bureau of Navigation
Receives Reports.
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
WASHINGTON. July 2.-The fiscal year
which ended on Friday was exceptional
for the American merchant marine in sev
eral respect?. Pull report? will not be
received by the Bureau of Navigation for
several weeks, but returns already re
ceived to warrant these statements.
The total output of American ship
yards has been the largest in any year
fur the last quarter of a century, â¢
1 1881, when 1384 vessels of 360,302 gross tuns
I were built and documented in the United
States. During the past fiscal year the
construction of merchant vessels, offi
cially returned, has consisted of 1129 ves
sels of 320.57>; gross tuns. Besides these
twenty-two vessels of foreign construction
: nirure gat-ing 30,181 gross tons have been
admitted to American registry. It is also
i n ported from Manila that since last Au
gust 141 vessels have been transferred
from the hands of the Spanish, German
and British subjects to Americans, indi
cating the confidence of the business men
of Manila in the American Government.
The tonnage of these vessels has not yet
! been reported and the transfer does not
I carry with it all the rights or American
registry. Had the Senate- passed the
House bill for the registry of Hawaiian
Is the total additional tonnage to our
' merchant fleet during the year would
i have reached nearly 100,000 tons. Our
! largest annual production was in 1555,
when 2027 vessels of $83,450 tons were built
i and documented. During 1898 Great Brlt
'am built 1549 vessels of 1,390,114 tons. The
| difference in the kind of vessel built is
! roughly disclosed by the average size,
i our construction averaging only about 225
tons, while the British averages 900 tons.
Nearly all of our new tonnage is built
to navigate in the coasting trade reserved
Ito American vessels. The only steamship
built directly for the foreign trade \verÂ«
the Havana and Mexico of the New York
and Cuba Mail and the four "admiral"
steamships for Cuba and Jamaica, aggre
gating 10.750 tons, which were built under
the postal subsidy act. In anticipation of
legislation at the coming session, haw
! ever, construction has begun or been con
| tracted for on about 100,000 tons of steel
! steamship for foreign trade and trade
; with Hawaii and Porto Rico, involving
an expenditure of about $15,000,1
For the first time In our history, on
June .TO, the total tonnage of our steam
vessels, when tabulated, will exceed the
t,it;ii '>f ;>ll other kinds of documented
vessels. During the year, however, 460
i sail vessels of 96,468 tons have been built,
I compared with 426 of 42,502 tons for the
previous year, while the steam vessels
built numbered 47s of 167,851 tons, com
pared with 448 of 110.128 tons for the pre
â  vious year. In certain trades our large
: sailing vessels endeavor t<> compete with
foreign cargo steamships and doubtless
will continue to do so. at all events un
til the construction of the Nicaraguan
canal.
A notable vessel is the John Smeaton,
a steel schooner of f-040 grr,pp tons, built
at West Superior. Wls., probably the
largest tore and aft vessel ever built.
The largest sea-going sailing vessel built
in Europe in lv.<S was the Ernest Siegfried
of Havre. 3214 tons.
For the first time in our history Bteel
, has become the principal material in our
! annual construction of rigged vessels. tie
Steel tonnage for the year being 133,991
tons, wood 130,309 tons. Iron has ceased to.
bo ? shipbuilding material, only <>ne ves
el of nine tons having been built of iron.
i During 1898 in Great Britain 96 per cent or
practically the whole construction except
small fishing vessels was of steel.

In the beginning of the riot? the
mob placed obstacles on the street rail

charged and the first shots were fired.
Several persons were wounded. In one
a bullet passed through a shop
and killed a shop assistant within.
As the day advanced the disorders in

Several d< sertlons occurred, and the de

CHINESE MINISTER HAS

WASHINGTON, July 2.â Minister Wu
Ting Fang of China returned to the city
to-day from a three months' European
trip, which he made to present his cre
dentials as Minister to Spain, as well as
the I'nited States. Concerning the Queen
Reg) nt and her son, he said:
"The Quoin Regent is a good woman,
whom I admire very much. She has
many gracious qualities and has the love
of her country ;tt heart. Any unpopular
ity which may exist toward her is due en
tirely i" the fact that she is a foreigner
by birth. The boy King, whose birthday
anniversary 1 attended while in Madrid,
is a bright and sensible lad, who speaks
several languages, though he appears to
be Bomewhat delicate in health."
It was suggested to the Minister that
the discussion regarding the dismember
ment of China had subsided recently, to
which he made an affirmative reply. He
expressed himself as highly Incredulous
:>f the reports coming from Vancouver of
the probable abdication of the Emperor.
This is entirely unlikely, he said, Inas
much as the reigning monarch was put
on the throne by the Empress Dowager,
whose nephew he also Is.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex.. .T\ily 2.â There is no im- '
provement in the distressing situation in
the extensive flooded districts of Central
- uthern Texas. <Â»n the contrary the
Inundation is growing worse. There has j
been another twenty-four hours of heavy. ,
continuous rains, which added to the â¢
already unprecedented volumes of water
in the rivers and creek:-: of the richest 1
agricultural region In the State. There '
to be no end to the rainfall. The 1
Si a of water now extends from the north ]
central part of the State to the Gull a ,
distance uf 300 miles and more, and with | ,
an average width of probably seventy- 1
five miles. The great flood began nearly
a week ago. and the suffering of the peo- '
pie in the inaccessible localities that are '
surrounded and completely cut off from ,
communication with the outside world h
must be severe. j 1
Every possible effort is being made to j 1
'rescue the unfortunate men, women and
children thus situated, and all to-day res
cuers plied the turbulent waters in im- '
provised boats and rafts picking up the : (
stranded people and conveying them to
higher land.
Railroad official? can do nothing to im
prove the situation to their damaged
properties. More costly bridges are re
ported to have been swept away tO-day,
among them being that of the Missouri,
Kansas and Texas road over Little River.
All traffic over that division was sus
pended last night. Freight and passenger
business is at a standstill.
'I'll.- International and Great Northern:
Railroad this morning started .nit a large,
wrecking force to work in the water be
tween here and Hearne to replace the
track and bridges, it has Beveral bridges
to be replaced and much of its track has
been under water. The Houston and
Texas Central does not expect to get its
trains running for six days yet. The
track is four feet under water for much . '
uf its way from Hearnfi down, and as (
a number of bridges have been washed 1
away and workmen cannot get at the j
creeks to replace them, owing to the rag- |
Ing torrents they will of necessity have to i
wait until the waters subside.
The estimated damage of $4,000,000 to the !
country tributary to the Brazos Valley
is none too high, as reports received to
day and to-night merely confirm the tale
of loss and suffering reported yesterday.
The loss of life, though heavy, will not be
as lurge as reported, and will be princl- ,
pally among the negroes.
The Southern Pacific is standing the j
floods better than any other trunk line in '
the State.. That road has profited by past
experience and its roadbed, track and
bridges are far above high-water mark
of the raging rivers.
Arrivals from Chappel Hill to-day say
scores of houses have passed down the
Brazos River near there during the last
twenty-four hours. The carcasses of hun
dreds of cattle, horses and other livestock
have floated by.
Judging from the number of residences
in the. river, there must have 1 n much
destruction of property at points above
there. It is still impossible to verify at
this time the numerous reports of loes of
life in the bottoms of the IJrazos. and its
tributaries. The earlier reports of heavy
loss of life in Robertson County, caused!
by a meeting of the waters of the Brazos
and Little Brazos rivers, have been con- 1
firmed.
The information received here to-day I
from Calvert, which Is In the midst of the
scene of the destruction, is meager, but l
is to the effect that over seventy persons '
are missing. Nine bodies have been re
covered. The floods of the two river? :
came up so suddenly that the negroes
living between the water courses had no
opportunity to escape. They were caught !
in a trap and drowned.
N. R. Bagley, a commission man of \
Kansas City, arrived to-day direct from '
the Hooded region uf Dewitt and adjoin
ing counties. He was directing the ship-,
ment of watermelons when the big rise
occurred. He estimates that over 1000
cars of watermelons of that section were
sw-ppt away by the high waters.
He said: "No one would believe the
extent and the terrible effects of the flood
iii Walter and other counties in the
Colorado and Brazos valleys unless he
had seen for himself. I can not describe
It better than to say that the whole coun
try is under water. I saw hundreds of
horses and cattle standing in fields with j
the water up to their necks. It has
taken me four flays to get from Cuero to
Austin. Many miles of railroads are un- j
der water and in some places an effort is j
being made to run local passenger trains i
with water covering the track to a depth
of nearly three feet. It is not only the
Colorado and Brazos that are inflicting I
great damage, but small streams also are
:! ling the country."
It is estimated that over 2000 wagon
road bridges have been washed away In 1
the counties comprising the flooded dis- ;
trlct. The loss from this source alone is j
v. rv heavy. In some counties as many i
as 200 bridges are gone.
The Bosque is the latest river to got on
a rampage. A telephone message was j
received here to-day -from Walnut j
Bprings stating that that stream was
out of its banks, and that thousands of
acres of shocked wheat had been swept
away. It had also washed away several i
miles of track of the Houston and Texas
Central road, as well as two bridges near,
Walnut Spring?.
HOMESTEAD STRIKE
IS INSIGNIFICANT
Not Enough Men Out to Interfere

PTTTSBT'RO, July 2.â The strike at the
Homestead plant of the Carnegie Com

Newspaper men were escorted through
the mills to-night for the purpose of giv
lng them ocular proof of the company s
claims that all departments were in op
eration. To the reporters every branch
seemed to be working to the limit.
Both Bides claim to be satisfied, the
company because it feels assured that the

QUIET ROYALIST
MOVE IN CUBA
A Weil-Known Cuban
General at Its Head.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA. July 2.â La I.ucha will to
morrow publish a statement regarding
matters which its conductors say they
have been investigating and carefully
guarding for several weeks, owing to the
reticence of those concerned and the de
sire of the latter to avoid a premature
disclosure, leading to a possible failure
of their plans. The paper will say:
"Cuba during the last few months had
been a land of many surprises. The latest
is the establishment of a royalist party.
The new organization is unimportant at
present, probably numbering fewer than
fifty members, but a well known Cuban
general, who claims to be a descendant
of Charlemagne, is reported to be the
head of the party, and the meeting place
is usually the Inglaterra Cafe. The Cu
ban general In question is said to be dls
satislied with American rule. He thinks
that what Cuba needs is not a republic
but a strong hand at the helm like his
own. He is of the opinion that the people
of the Latin race prefer royalty and the
possible honors accruing under a mon

General Ludlow has been made aware
of his successful attempts to collect

According to such other reports of this
bombastic scheme as have leaked out, the
promoter has represented that he will
persuade a majority of the Alcaldes to
give the movement their support by prom
ising to make them dukes, counts and
barons. It is also in the plans to form a
Cuban Legion of Honor. Several persons
who affect to believe that such a scheme
might succeed say the outcome will de
pend largely on the charm of novelty with
a populace" judiciously prepared to em
brace the ideas.
The theory ia that it would be accept
able to such families as already have
titles of Spain and to Spaniards residing
in Cuba who. owing to business or other
considerations, have been compelled to
forfeit their patents of nobility. The pro
moters of the movement allege that they
expect llnancial assistance from these
sources, as the plan promises to substi
tute equal dignities and positions for
those that have been forfeited.

MINERS MADE
NO OUTBREAK
Another Quiet Day at
Carterville.
MILITIA TAKE POSSESSION
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. I.OUIS. July 2.â A special to the Re
public from Cartervllle, 111., says that had
it not been for the militia patrollng the
streets to-day, strangers would hardly
guess that the little city was in the midst
of a struggle berween capital and labor.
Both sides in the trouble between the
union miners and the non-union men lay
on their arms and there were no disturb
ances. The presence of troops quieted
matters and allayed fears of riotous out
breaks.
In accordance with the orders issued by |
! Acting Governor Warder through Adju- |
\ tant General Recce last night, two com- j
i panics of militia, C of Carbondale, under
; Captain Barton, and F of Mount Vernon, j
i under Captain Pavey, arrived at Carbon
! dale on a special train to-day. There
they awaited the coming of Colonel j
Bennett of Greenville, who arrived at
noon. He took command of the troops
and the special arrived at Cartervllle at
1 p. m. They immediately camped in a
grove on the outskirts of town.
A detachment of Company C was de- j
j tailed to patrol the roads leading to the !
; Brush mines and a detail of Company D
patroled the outskirts of town.
Colonel Culver of the Sixth Illinois
Regiment came down from Springrield on !
the noon train as the representative of i
; Ac-ting Governor Warder to look over the |
situation. The business men and citizens
generally of Carterville expressed dis
approval of the action of the Acting Gov
ernor in sending the militia here.
No manifestation of hostility was made
toward the soldiers by the crowd that
had assembled at the station when they
came in, but the consensus of opinion was
i that there was no occasion for their pres- :
j enee here. Sheriff Gray was roundly do- j
nounced by several merchants for his :
telegrams *to the Governor, which re
sulted in the calling out of the troops.
i This afternoon a delegation of merchants
| and property-owners called on Colonel
Culver to protest against the presence
I of the troops and to ask their withdrawal. ;
The members of the delegation Btated
that Sheriff Gray had not exhausted his i
resources to prevent a conflict and that â¢
he did not even attempt to raise a posse;
I furthermore, that he was not at the scene I
! of the trouble more than three hours dur- i
ing the two days it lasted.
At the meeting of the leading merchants '
of the town Saturday night, $450 was
raised to defray the expenses of sending
away the non-union miners in the Brush
shaft. The miners have expressed their
willingness to go, and had it not been for
the arrival of the militia to-uay it is said
that within forty-eight hours not one of '
the negroes would be in the mine. As it
is the citizens fear that their purpose has
been temporarily thwarted, but hope is ,
expressed that the existing agreement
may still be carried out and a peaceful .
solution of the difficulty arrived at.
FIFTEEN MORE FEVER
CASES IN SANTIAGO
Troops Have Been Removed From
the Infected Camp to a More
Healthy Place.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, July 2.â Ten j
new cases of yellow fever were reported
yesterday and five have been reported to- j
day. This raises the total number of cases j
to seventy-four. No deaths have been ;
reported to-day.
The United States troops have all been I
removed from the infected camp, but the i
doctors seem unable to check the progress !
of the disease among them. The camp, i
which is on the road to El Morro and in :
a hilly country, was chosen because of its
known salubrity and perfect sanitary j
conditions. There are no cases of yellow j
fever in the city.
Bryan's Sentiments.

RIO DB JANEIRO, July 2.â Dispatches j
from Bahia say that United States Minis- j
ter Bryan's presence at the banquet at |
Alagoas was the occasion for great j
demonstration of sympathy. Mr. Bryan ;
said that it gave him great pleasure to
see the United States and Brazilian flags
side by side, and that the two nations
would advance together to foster civil
lzatlon, peace and the union of America.
RINGLEADERS
OF RIOTERS
DECAPITATED
Twenty Koreans Executed
and Their Heads Exhib
ited as a Warning.
EMPEHORJS4LARMBD
Instructions Issued to Garrisons to
Suppress the Growing
Insurrections.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash., July 2.â Oriental
, advices received to-day state that
twenty ringleaders of the rioters who
! destroyed and burned electric tramway
curs at Seoul last month were executed :
in public at Korea's capital four weeks j
! ago. They met their fate bravely, i
1 Their heads were cut off and exhibited ;
in public places as a warning to all
evil doers.
It was believed that this summary
action would also have an important j
influence upon the leaders of the j
\ Korean rebellion, which was assuming
large proportions. At last accounts in
' surgents were marching toward Seoul.
The Emperor and his Cabinet are
thoroughly alarmed. A late message
states that the Government at Seoul
! has Issued instructions to the garri
: sons of Kungju and Chullju to proceed
to Kofu to suppress the insurrection.
A telegram from Chemulpo says the
i Japanese charge d'affaires at Seoul has
â  ; sent a letter to the Korean Govern
â¢ : tnent advising it to abolish laws for the
' punishment of accomplices in treason
; I and other capital offenses. This would
. ! have the effect of allaying the fears of
i I the ignorant country people who have
i been le<i into the rebellion and then
i kept in the insurgent ranks by threats
that they would otherwise be exposed
to the Government agents and decapi
tated for treason.
STREET CARS COLLIDE
WITH FATAL RESULTS
Three Killed and Many Injured in
Two Pennsylvania
Wrecks.
PHILADELPHIA. July 2.â A collision

tin, was killed and several people badly
injured. Herbert Fitzgerald, a passen
ger, and William Alexander, the motor
man of the second car, were seriously in
jured and three or four others sustained
severe bruises or contusions.
A car had lost the trolley, and becom
ing darkened was not seen by the car
which followed, and the latter cra.~h"d
into the former while going at full speed.

lision were heavily loaded with passen
gers returning from Kennwood Park.
Motorman Griffith stopped his car near
the bottom of the hill to get a drink of
water at a spring near by. He had hardly
left his car when the electric current, for
some reason as yet unexplained, wa.s
shut off, leaving the car in darkness. Mo
torman Kirkland, with his car, followed
shortly afterward, and as the foremost
car was In darkness, it could not be seen
until too late to check the speed. The
rear car crashed into the other with ter
rific force, almost telescoping it. Mr. Op
sion was standing on the rear platform of
the first car and received the full force of
the impact. Both of his legs were cut off
and his skull crushed. He lived but a
short time.
Kirkland was badly mangled, his head
and body being crushed. He lived about

OIL TRUST LOOKING
FOR STREET RAILROADS
Ag-ent of the Combine Inspecting
Lines in Many
Cities.

Standard Oil Trust poems to he reaching
after the street railway lines In a number
of Western cities. Among them are said to
be those in Kansas City, Omaha, Sioux
City. Minneapolis and St. Paul. It has
just been learned that a New York en
gineering expert of the Standard Oil Com
pany was in S.oux City two days last
week inspecting the lines and property of
the Sioux City Traction Company, and it
leaked out that he came to Sioux City
from Omaha, where he spent four days on
the same mission, and that his inspection
of the Kansas City properties occupied :
eight days.
He went from Sioux City to Minne
apolis and is now either in that city or
St. Paul. It was Impossible to learn the
name of the expert as great secrecy is be- ;
ing maintained and, of course, nothing re- '
gardTng the report he will make can be !
obtained direct. From a reliable, source
it was learned that the report spoke in
favorable terms of the Kansas City and
Omaha properties and that he said the
St. 'Joseph. Mo., system was not being
considered.

SWORD FOR MARTYR
Women of Atlanta Will Present a
Jeweled Blade to Replace
the One Broken.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tort
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Uor
don Bennett.
PARIS, July 2.â The Figaro pub- J
lishes the following letter from the
Prince of Monaco to Mrae. Dreyfus:
Madame: You have with admirable I
i courge defended the honor of jour bus
| band, and triumphant justice briny* to
I you the reparation due. In order to Help
; you to forget such suffering and sucti
: grief 1 invite your husband to come t'Â»
I mv Chateau de Marchais so soon as the |
I holy work of justice has been accom- j
I plished. The presence of the martyr to- i
ward whom the conscience of humanity
- turned in its anguish will honor my ;
I house. Among the sympathy which you
receive none is more sincere and none
more respectful than mine.
Th 3 Chateau de Marehais, the au- i
I tumn residence of the Prince of Mo- i
' naco, is, says the Figaro, in Aisne De- |
partment, twenty kilometers from
L.aon.
Captain Coffiniere de Nordeck, com
! mander of the French cruiser Sfax, !
which brought Captain Dreyfus to
France, says in an interview published ;
that he was struck by the immense
power of self-control displayed by Cap
-1 tain Dreyfus during the voyage. The
i prisoner's attitude throughout was !
j "one of irony and disdain." He had
! been suffering severely from sea sick
i ness when he was transferred to the j
! Sfax, but he walked with firm tread !
iand during the entire trip never showed
a sign of weakness or nervousness.
Captain Dreyfus was ignorant of the ;
fact that a new court-martial awaited j
him and remained in ignorance during
the first part of the voyage. When he
was finally informed not a muscle of
I his face moved. He merely said: "I
| have no ill will toward anybody. I
! shall be glad to re-enter the army,
which I have never ceased to love."
He did not allude to the subject
again during the voyage. Most of the
time he passed in reading.
As the outcome of the Government's
prudence all Franco remains tranquil, j
Maitres Demange and Laborie, with
Mathieu Dreyfus and his wife, arrived
this* evening. The town is quite tranquil.
Maitre Laborie, who will defend Cap
tain Dreyfus before the court-martial. \
has never yet seen him, and Mme. Drey
fus has only obtained permission to visit
her husband thrice weekly for an hour. ,
His composure is the theme of all '
j tongues. It seems that on the train one ;
i of the. officers began to read a newspaper, <
! but although Dreyfus had not seen a pa
per since he left France he did not dis- i
play the slightest interest. He speaks
very little and seems 10 suffer a partial
paralysis of speech, owing to his long <
silence. Even on hoard the Sfax he had i
to communicate with the officers by writ- ;
| ing. He is credited on good authority j
with the following:
"My condemnation and sentence were
I the symbol of anti-Jewish odium. My
i Judges were involuntarily deceived. May
j my undeserved expiation put an end to
all racial or religious feuds in the army
and in that France which I have passion
ately loved and served."
To-morrow Maitre Demange will give
him a written statement of all that hap
pened and fully explain the situation.
RENNES, July 2.â Mme. Dreyfus had a ;
third interview with her husband this !
afternoon. She found him much better.
He received her with smiles instead of
tears. Overdoses <>f quinine while on
Devils Island left him with a serious in- j
digestion. He expresses himself con
vinced that he will be acquitted.
ATLANTA, Ga., July 2.â Mrs. Jos. T. J
Eichberg of Atlanta, assisted by sev
eral leading women of this city, has :
started a movement to raise $2000 with
j which to purchase a fine jeweled
: sword to be presented to Captain â¢
Dreyfus. Mrs. Eichberg thinks the
sword of the captain, which was ]
broken to disgrace him, should be re
placed by one presented by his Ameri
can friends, and she is actively en
gaged in obtaining subscriptions before
ordering the sword in New York to be i
j handed to Captain Dreyfus at the end j
I of his trial in Kennes. Much interest j
has been aroused in the movement, j
especially among the Atlanta Hebrews,
and there seems no doubt that funds
will be quickly raised. Mrs., Eichbers
will ask the French Government for
permission to present the sword.
PASS A NIGHT ON
A YOSEMIT C PEAK
Two Women and a Girl Have an Un
comfortable Experience While
Out Sight-Seeing.
TOSEMITE, July 2.â On tho heights <<i
Columbia Rock Miss Helen M. Brown of :
Utica, N. V., Mrs. Mary A. Knapp of j
Boston and little Hazel Knox, aged only '
12, of Merced had an experience last nip'nt
that will always recall their visit to the |
Yosemite. Columbia Rock is on the trail
to Easle Peak. The rock is on the edge !
of a precipice and an iron railing has
been put there to give nervous people a
sense of security while viewing the val
ley beneath.
When the ladies reached the point last \
evening on their return from Eagle j
Peak the stars were shining over the
great gorge of the Yosemite. Below them j
was a mile or more of zi^zip trail, and j
the edge of the precipice was too un- ,
comfortably clos=e to permit them to pro- ;
ceed without considerable danger. To .
remain where they were meant safety, j
their only fear being that a stray bear
or mountain lion might chance that way.
It did not take them long to decide to .
remain on the rock. They could see the
lights from the hotel and camps below.
A dance was being held on the platform
at the Sentinel and they heard the music
and the different calls.
On their failure to return to the Curry !
camp the guardian was notified and a '
searching party of three was soon |
climbing the trail. It had provisions,
bedding and ropes, but fortunately none
of these were required, except the food.
As the party ascended the trail it blew
a horn, reminding one of rescuing parties
of the Alps.
At 12:30 o'clock the climbers reached >
Columbia Rock and there pistol shots j
told the anxious watchers below that the j
lost party had been found and was safe. ]
WRESTS A PISTOL
FROM A ROBBER
PRESCOTT, Ariz., July 2.â A masked !
man entered the O. K. saloon kept by |
"Tommy" Smith a little before midnight j
last night and leveled a revolver at Smith
with the usual "Throw up your hands" !
remark. Instead of complying. Smith
wrested the revolver from the would-be j
robber's grasp and clubbed the fellow into j
unconsciousness with it.
Then he called an officer, who placed |
the man in jail. Smith had between $300
and $400 in the saloon at the time.
Body Found in a Well.
MARYSVILLE. July 2.â The body of j
Christopher C. Hopkins, a pioneer resi
dent of this county, who was missing for
ten days, was found in a well at the Sim
coe farm, jjve wiles east of town to-day, j
Hopkins evidently fell in while repairing
the curbing to the well a week ago last
Wednesday. He was alone on the place
at the time. The body floated to the sur
face to-day.

en to the street and saved practically
nothing.

A BRILLIANT HALF YEAR
THE half year just closed makes a fine exhibit. 1
The commercial situation shows no loss in
strength, and confidence in the future is a< fan- j
guine as ever. The amount oi business done during
the first half of 1899 was larger than ever before
known, while the general level of prices during
six months was the highest since the spring of 1893
The transportation companies report larger earnings,
i n gpii â  ,'ering rates of transportation.
The failure- were 4852, with liabilities of $48,811,000,
; 6766, with liabilities of $71,246,000, during the
first half of 1898. Here in San Francisco the in
crea- - for the first half of the year is shown
by bank clearing- of 5443.200.000, against 397, i-v
last year.
There are at present no indications that the last half
of 1899 will make any poorer showing than the first |
half. True, .luring the past few weeks the gap be- !
tween the national exports and imports has been
steadily closing, and the former no longer exceed the ;
latter so enormously as at the beginning of the year.
They are still in large excess, however, and as lonj
we sell more than we buy we are all right.
The great staples continue firm, and are more ac
tive than usual at this time of the year, when the mid
summer heat throughout the Fast cuts down business
matetially. Ma,ny of the iron and steel works are so
ciowdcd with orders that they have passed the u-ual
bhutdown ai tin- season and will work right along.
Prices for iron and steel are easily maintained at
their present high level, though orders for distant
future delivery have fallen off of late. The market
pre-ents an Augean task for the furnaces, for they no (
sooner get one line of F.nropean contracts out of the
way than fresh orders come pouring in. Some fur
naces, indeed, have started in with orders for their
whole year's product. The activity in wool con
tinue- unabated, and the cotton mills arr doing well.
as the demand i- so good that it keeps them busy in
spite of the recent fall in the raw product. The boot
.-Mid shoe industry has broken all record-, shipments
being enormous and the distributive demand heavy
in all directions, while the factories nave orders for
several months ahead.
The local situation compares favorably with that in
the East.. Xo better crops could be wished, and with
the single exception of hay are likely to bring good
prices. There is a scarcity in oats and barley at the
moment, which has advanced prices for both descrip j
tions, something unusual in the month of July, when ;
the new crops are coming in. Wheat remains steady j
at prices which, though not high, are still profitable
to the farmer. The demnnd for fruit on canning ac
count is as active as ever, and the unusually high
prices are placing the fruit growers on velvet. The
dried fruit market being cleaned up, good prices will
probably rule for the incoming crop, and, indeed, i
opening figure- already established are considerably
above those predicted several months ago by local
dealer^. There i'; a fine domestic and foreign demand
for the genera; run of merchandise, and the lumber
market i^ more active than for some years at strong
price-. Hops and won] are quoted at a much higher
range than expected last spring, and there is an active
inquiry for both. As has already been remarked this
i- essentially the fanner's year, and the city is reaping
the benefit of it. The mines, too, are in much better
condition than last year at this time, when lack of
water forced many to suspend operations. In brief,
on whatever side we look, we find the State in a con
dition of agricultural and commercial activity that fills
everybody with confidence. A significant sign in this
direction is the scarcity of labor, which has resulted
in a general advance in harvest wages, the beneficial
effect of which throughout the State at large can
hardly be overestimated.
It is said that Dreyfus has lost the power of speech
and with it the ability to defend himself before his
Judges. The testimony of his terrible sufferings that
his tortured face will bear witness will be more elo
quent in pleading than any words he could use or
command.
An Oakland pastor who has had a disagreement
with his flock says he will take a vacation and po to
Fresno or some other warm place. His friends might
have induced him to be more explicit in reference to
his destination, as his enemies will certainly not lose
the opportunity.
About this time look out for fires and accidents:
they are liable to happen with the best regulated use
of firecrackers and bombs
ANOTHER MONOPOLY DEFEAT.
OX Monday last, with the general concurrence
of the public, the Market-street Railway Com
pany was virtually accorded all the rights and
privileges necessary for the extension of street rail
way facilities to the northeastern part of San Fran
cisco. In accordance with views The Call had re
peatedly expressed, complete provision for the cork-
I screw line, through the Post-street system with its
; connections and extensions, was legally made by the
Hoard of Supervisors. An effort to include the new
franchise on Grant avenue and Bush street was de
feated.
It was noticed, however, that Mayor Phelan ex
pressed his entire willingness that this new franchise,
intended to perfect the control of the north end of the
city by the Market-street monopoly, should be award- j
Â,! "I see many advantages in it," was his reported;
language. Upon this change of front, in the face of!
his ostentatious resistance to the original Market
street scheme, The Call has already commented. But
it has not yet exposed the full extent and the treach- j
erous nature of the fraud which it was fully intended |
msummate to-day. It has now become apparent
that in order to lull the community into security, the
Grant avenue and the Bush street robbery was kept j
in the background, with the deliberate intention of
forcing it through the Hoard of Supervisors after the
legitimate cork-crew line had been secured.
Thi^ is practically a holiday on which good citizens j
are preparing for the due celebration of the great
event that for the first time gave man a controlling
influence in his own government. But action upon !
the four franchises, not yet reported, of which the j
Grant avenue and the Bush street loop is the prin
cipal, will not be deferred through the action of the j
Market-street Railway Company, but by causes be- !
yond its control. No man ever knew the Huntington
monopoly in any of its numerous disguises to delay j
the completion of a fraud from patriotic motives or!
from any manly impulse.
There was nothing surprising in the treachery of '
the railway in reserving these four franchises for what
it expected to be a separate and independent exhibi
tion of municipal corruption. But its confidence that i
it could actually secure the indorsement of a majority!
of the Board of Supervisors was simply astounding:
and was fortunately misplaced. The Call has care- i
fully investigated the situation, and has given every
Supervisor who can be reached an opportunity for
explanation. It is happy to announce that at least:
six of them, namely. Supervisors Perrault, Byington, j
Deasy. Lackmann, Kalben and Collins, have distinct- I
ly announced that they will not vote for the four new
franchises or any of them. But for the position taken ,
by Supervisor Collins yesterday, as no hostile action
by Mayor Phelan could be relied upon, the defeat or
the' victory of the Market -street Railway monopoly;
might have rested exclusively with Supervisor Ileyer. 'â¢
Although for the reasons stated the public interests
are safe and it i- even doubtful whether the four fran
chises will be reported by the committee, the attitude
of Supervisor Heyer deserves serious treatment. The
advocates "i the Market-street robbery- have repeat
edly bragged that they had a Supervisor in reserve
who at the right time would range himself against the
community. Tested by his voluntary declarations,
that Supervisor Heyer above ;ill others should have
been the reliance of Superintendent Lynch would be
inconceivable. In The Call of May 31 he said: "I
will oppose the granting of the proposed franchises
to the Market street Railway Company as long as I
have a vote in the board. * * * On Monday I
voted against the attempt to grant the proposed fran
chiscs. and I shall continue so to vote until the end
of the chapter."
When interviewed on Saturday last he professed
; the fa ts in relation to the four fran
chise*, with which he was perfectly familiar when his
live intentions were expre-sed as we have quoted
them, declared that his entire information on the
subject was derived from the newspapers and de
clined to intimate on which side his vote would be
cast. On its face this attitude is hard to explain. It
spreads a deep scarlet color over the insinuations
that have been so frequent against the ultimate in
tegrity of Supervisor Heyer. Fortunately, through
the announcement of Supervisor Collins, his impor
tance in the controversy has ceased. But if possible
he should assuredly make some explanation to the
people. Such treason to common honesty, such re
volting indifference to appearances as would be in
volved in his defection from his incorruptible asso
ciates, is hardly credible. Even Judas Iscariot did not
precede his immortal infamy by a proclamation of his
own integrity. There is not a pen in the United
States sufficiently vitriolic to do justice to the kind
and the degree of apostacy that was attributed to
Supervisor Heyer, although it has really become in
consequential.
VALENTINE AND HIS RECORD.
PRESIDENT VALENTINE of the Wells-
Fargo Company, not content with shirking
taxes, discriminating in favor of large shippers
against smaller ones and levying upon the pub
lic all the tribute it will consent to pay. has of late
felt a new yearning for victims and has found them
in the agents of the company. A circular has gone
forth announcing that their commissions are to be re
duced as much as 50 per cent.
Valentine sometimes accompanies his circulars to
his subordinates with quotations from the Bible ex
horting them to a pious life, and inferential!}- present
ing himself to them as a holy exemplar and teacher.
Whether in the order reducing commissions ho
changed the text of Scripture to suit his notion and
made it read, 'The workman is not worthy of his
hire." we know not. Certain it is, however, that if
put to it he could tlnd a text of some kind, could
preach a sermon on it. and then extort from the pub
lic money enough to have it printed in letters of gold
on plates of silver.
The tax-shirking Pharisee is at his best, however,
when posing as an exemplar rather than as a preacher.
Some years ago, when business was dull with the
company. Valentine issued an order reducing all sal
aries from 10 to 15 per cent, and for the comfort of
his victims set himself to be an example unto them of
how to bear a reduction of salary with Christian resig
nation. He announced that he would have his own
salary reduced by $2000 a year. Moreover, he did not
tell a lie. His salary as president of the Wells-Fargo
Company was actually reduced by the amount named,
and still Valentine wore his unctuous smile and was
as conspicuously pious as ever.
The seem of his posing so beautifully as a self
denying martyr to the cause of economy was a little
trick he had prepared for the occasion. At that time
WdK Far^n Company had control of the Commercial
National Bank at Portland, and Valentine had himself
elected president of the institution at a salary of $5000
a year. Thus, instead of a decrease of $2000 a year
from his official income, the astute poser obtained an
increase of $3000 a year.
In 1897 the affairs of the bank in Portland were
wound up. and Valentine then lost his salary as presi
dent. By that time, however, he had set his example
to the subordinates whose salaries he had cut down
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 3, 1899.
and there was no longer any need for posing. Ac
cordingly he obtained from the directors of Wells-
Fargo Company an increase of $5000 in his salary as
president of the company, so that he remains $3000
a year ahead of the game.
With many of the offenses committed by the tax
shirking corporation and its canting president the
public has no direct concern. They may reduce sala
ries and commissions to starvation wages if they so
choose, for there is no law to prevent. The nefarious
practice of tax-shirking is, however, one which the
law can prevent, and it is the duty of the officers of
the State to do so. Neither Valentine nor his com
pany should, be permitted to evade the taxes they
owe to California. It is the duty of the Assessor to
see to it that no cunning or insolence avails the shirk
ers in an effort to escape their obligations to the
State. To that extent at least their rapacity and their
frauds should be baffled and defeated.
THE FINANCES OF THE UNIVERSITY.
\A ORE than ordinary gratification will be felt
/ \ throughout the State over the action of the re
* gents in rescinding a resolution imposing a
registration fee upon students of the State University.
It is the desire of the people of the State of California
that education for the youth of the commonwealth
shall be free from its beginning to its highest forms,
and they have shown themselves to be ever willing to
bear whatever burden of taxation may be required to
accomplish it.
The Call was earnest in its opposition to the policy â 
of the regents in imposing the tax. and will now be
equally earnest in supporting any well-devised
measure they may adopt to meet the temporary de
ficiency in the funds of the institution and carry on its j
work "without curtailing the efficiency or limiting the
usefulness of any department. In a commonwealth
so rich as this an institution so strongly supported
by public sentiment and by private munificence can
hardly suffer seriously from the present embarrass
ment. It would have suffered, however, had the j
registration tax been imposed and the advantages of i
the institution been to some extent put beyond the
reach of the poor.
No reason exists for believing that the finances of
the university have been in any way wasted or mis
managed; the tirade of Governor Gage to the con
trary notwithstanding. The university is, in fact, one
of the few institutions of the State whose manage
ment has been kept free from politics and has tht
confidence of the public. Gage would doubtless like
to conduct it as he conducted his sheep business and
take possession of its offices as part of the spoils for
himself and Burns. Lacking ability to accomplish
that, he berates the regents as if their management of
the university were as bad as his own sheep record.
As a matter of fact it would now be the easiest
thing in the world for the regents to obtain a tem
porary loan to tide over the deficit in the funds had
not Gage himself, by defrauding a creditor of the
State, shown that so long as he is in office no one can
trust it.
Whatever may be the outcome, the regents have
acted rightly and wisely in rescinding the resolution
imposing the tax on students. The university is a
part of the public education of the State, and like all
other departments of that education it must be free.
ThjE DEWEY MONUMENT.
WITH the patriotic impulses aroused by the cele
bration of Independence day, there will come a
new ardor of public sentiment in favor of the
movement for the erection of a monument to Admiral
Dewey. The sum already raised is sufficient to attest
the earnestness of the people in promoting the enter
prise and virtually assures its success, so that it is
with confidence in the outcome each citizen may in
proportion to his means make his contribution to the
monument fund.
Since the establishment of the American Union
each successive generation has accomplished sonic
great work of national development and produced a i
hero of immortal memory. After Washington and
the Revolution came the War of ISI2 and Andrew
Jackson. The controversy over the slave question
precipitated the Civil War and brought to the front
the heroic military figure of General Grant Our
generation has fought the war that has broken down
the last vestige of Spanish domination in this hemi
sphere, raised the republic to the prestige of a world
power and furnished another hero to our annals in the
person of Admiral Dewey. The fame and the deeds
of Washington. Jackson and Grant have been fitly
commemorated in monumental art. and it is now for 1
us to give an equal expression to the gratitude of the
I (."pie to the hero of Manila Hay.
Almost every large city in the United States now
boasts some conspicuous accomplishment in the way
of monumental construction. We are rapidly ap
proaching the time when our cities will be as rich in
artistic achievements and historic memorials as those
of the Old World. California should keep pace with
the progress of her sister States in this respect. It is
right and fitting that the chief monument to Dewey
should stand in this city, and it is appropriate that it
should be erected while the glory of his victory is
still fresh in the minds of men.
One of the best ways to give your patriotism e\
pression in permanent form U to make a liberal con
tribution to the Dewey monument fund. A subscrip
tion may not make as much noise as a firecracker,
but the glory of it will- last longer.
No display of fireworks arranged by the Fourth of
July committee will blaze more conspicuously in the
public eye than the display it has made of the impera
tive need of men of genuine patriotism and true hon- j
esty to compose such a committee.
It will not matter much if the Peace Conference re- <
ject the proposal for the establishment of an inter- j
national tribunal of arbitration, as it appears there is !
not a single nation on the face of the globe that has a '
dispute it is willing to arbitrate.
Roosevelt is doubtless sincere in asserting that he
is not working up a boom for the Presidential
nomination, but it is certain that he is working his
Rough Rider reputation for all it is worth and a large
amount of fun to boot.
Frank Somers, the murderer of Christopher Gail
braith at Nevada City, appears at any rate to have
had some regard for decency. He took the trouble
to go out into the woods to kill himself.
The Market-street Railway Company has in
augurated a new industry in the city. It is taking
reputations as well as lives in its efforts to monopolize
the streets of San Francisco.
Even the elements seem to know that Captain
Dreyfus is a disturbing individual to the French peo
ple. The exiled officer was returned to his native
land in the midst of a terrific storm.
Tn its wideawake search for news the Associated
Press can find in the reports of our special corre
spondent from Samoa a good deal that will be inter
i esting to itself. I
NEWS OF THE
MINING FIELD
The prospects of the California mining
exhibit at the Paris Exposition have not
brightened during the week or become
less hazy and uncertain. It seems fairly
likely that the exhibit will be pretty well
abandoned to the wishes and discretion
of the three State Commissioners, as there
are strong symntoms that the California
Miners' Association will regard the size
of the mining allowance and the amount
of room for the display as 100 small to
warrant special efforts to get up a fine
display. Colorado is exerting itself to do
something handsome in the interest of Its
ir.ining industry, and a life-sized statue
of solid gold is to be one of its adver
tising features. Montana has five mineral
commissioners, who propose to make a
fine exhibit. California should top them
all, but it would require vigorous and
liberal effort on somebody's part.
The mining regions are crying for help
as well as the fruit and grain regions of
the valleys. No miner need seek employ
ment lons these days, and skilled and un
skilled labor of all kinds is In steady de
maud in a great number of booming
mining districts all over the State. The
situation in Shasta County, which re
flects its mining prosperity, is thus
described by the Redding Free Press:
"Experienced miners out of employ
ment are a decided scarcity in Shasta
County. In fact, there are none idle.
; laborers are also scarce. Capital is now
seeking labor here. < >scar G. Rogers,
i superintendent of the Mount Shasta
I mine, spent Wednesday night and Tues
j day morning in Redding in an endeavor
; to secure five X""d miners to be added to
: the Mount Shasta crew, but was com
pelled to return to the mine without a
| man. Ten miners were secured a few
days ago for the Mount Shasta. The
cause of the increase in the Mount Shasta
force is the development of the 300-foot
level which has just been opened.
"S. L. Stone, who has charge of the
outside work at the Harrison Gulch
property of the Midas Gold Mining Com
! pany, arrived in town Wednesday evening
!in search of thirty laborers. He was
' having hard work to secure that number
; Thursday. Applications are heard on
j all sides for men. A man need not be
I out of employment for a minute in this
< county."
Siskiyou County fully shares in the
! great mining activity of that whole slight-
I ly developed mineral region of Northern
i California, and has a great mining future
1.. fore it. The condition of the industry
ia concisely and conservatively stated by
the Yreka Journal as follows:
"Siskiyou County has now In active op
eration a good many fine paying quartz
mines, and it will not be long before new
and Important discoveries will be made,
as there an- quite a number of pros
i pectors In the hills looking after quartz.
There are hundreds of tine prospects in
this county .it the present time awaiting
development, and nil that is needed la a
little capital to turn them into nne pay-
Ing mines. The mines of this county have
never been boomed, but the county la
gradually and Eurely coming to the front
as nne of the best quartz mining: sec
tions In the State.
'There are till told. 225 stamps and two
Huntington mills in Siskiyou County. Of
this number 150 stamps are in continuous
operation, or at least as much as the
w iter supply of the respective properties
will permit. About forty stamps are idle
! from various causes. The remaining
thirty-five stamps are worked occasional
ly doing custom work and making an uc
ci Bionai run. Of the total 225 stamps
nearly V*i are in the Salmon River coun
try a-; are also the two Huntington
milis Not one of the stamp? fÂ» th; " dis '
'â  trict can be classed us Idle, and s<
arrastres are kept busy In the same
locality. Of the forty .-tamps now idle
preparations are in progress to stari
about one-third or more. The 225 stamps
are divided among thirty-two different
mines or an average of nearly seven
stamps. The Black Bear and Gold Ball
head the list with the largest number.
A number ot r.ew mills are also in con
templation by parties who have recently
purchased mines here."
Still another "gold-dredging" plant for
working the tempting submerged gravels
of the auriferous streams is to be tried.
The Stanislaus Dredging Company has
I three miles of such placer ground on the
Stanislaus River, near Robinson Ferry,
and w. M. Stover, the president, has
adopted the caisson mode of operation
after inspecting the operation of a small |
experimental nnn put on the San Joaquin
River, near Pollasky. Fresno County, by
Mr. DonahOO, the inventor, who has
patented it. In this booming dredger
time the practical experiment with a
i phÂ«n opposed to all past experience will
:be watched with interest. This new sub
marine gold-saving machine is thus de
scribed In the Sonors Democrat:
'The one for the new company will be
; mounted on a dredger to be built and
launched near Robinson Ferry. It will
â  - i feet long. 40 feet wide and draw but
1! Inches of water, thus permitting its
sful operation even during the
period of extremely low water. The bed
r , k is to be reached by a caisson four
teen feel square in the clear, which will
be allowed to Â«itik of its own weight.,,
when- the water will be forced out by
means of compressed air, and the space
witiiin the caisson cleaned up and so on. j
The dirt is to be hoisted to the boat bj i
i means of a twelve-inch centrifugal pump i
' and turned into a double line of sluices, |
. . . h making the circuit of onp end and

Easy lessons In minim? ran hp found in
plenty among the stories of failure .or
partial failure of California mining ven
tures conducted by men without enough
mining wisdom and experience. Here is
a very good one from the Amador Re
publican :
"The Bay State mine, near Plymouth,
wns actively promoted about five years
a^n and a company of local business nun
was organised to develop the property.
Work was carried nn about two years
under this company and a shaft sunk to a
depth of about TOO feet This shaft was
n, it on the Ledge and no crosscut was
mad-' to the ledge from it. The work
Was very expensive and the local capital
ists and business men found it a pretty
burdensome affair and finally allowed the
management to contract debts and then
failed to provide funds to pay them. The
consequence was of course insolvency and
a forced sale of the prospect mine and
improvements before anything could be
known a.s to the value of the property,
more than was known before they com
menced. It was sold to Stockton capital
ists who are now continuing the explora
tion work. They will crosscut to the vein
and run drifts on it In order to deter
mine its value at the depth already
reached and also sink a*) feet more hi the
shaft. When this is done they can form
some estimate of what the mine is worth.
At present it may be said that the sur
face prospects warrant thorough explo
ration and the situation of the claim in
the mineral belt allows no unfavorable
presumption."
Here is another from the .same Issue of
the same paper:
"The Ivanhoe Company has until re
cently been attempting to carry on explo
ration and exploitations simultaneously
from thf grass roots down. Thfr*- are f.w
situations whore this can be done advan
tageously and the Ivanhoe seems not to
1 m> of the exceptions. The mill has
been stopped and some of the men dis
charged while those retained will be kept
at the work of sinking the shaft deeper
drifting, etc., until a larger body of ore
has been made accessible and there is
room to handle it without inconvenience."
There is a Vigorous discussion poing on
among Northern California papers as to
the cause of so many dead fish constantly
floating down the upper Sacramento now.
It has been the general assumption that it
was a result of the operation of the big
smelter of the Mountain Copper Company
at Keswick, the peculiar theory being
that the smelter slag which is dumped
into Spring Creek and partly borne down
the river is responsible, fine, sharp par
ticles of slag, like ground glass getting
into the gills of the fish. The Redding
Free Press defends the smelter by as
serting that it is neither the copper mines,
dynamite nor sea lions that does the mis
chief, but that the fish get caught in the
big log and wood jams in the Pitt River
and below.
One of the largest sales of mining prop
erty ever made in Siskiyou County has
just been effected in the sale of the
Schroeder quartz mine of the Deadw. 0,1
District, miles from Yreka. to a
Canadian company for 1100,000. It is a
paying property, with a ledge tapped by
a tunnel at the depth of 12"0 feet. The
property will be vigorously developed un
der the puperintendency of Mr. Schroeder,
the former owner, who has been retained.
The Virginia Dale Mining District of
San Bernardino County has developed a
condition of permanent prosperity since
several good mines have become pro
ducers. The O. K. mine has been opened
to a depth of 230 feet, where the forty
one-inch vein yields ore of increasing
value. The last run at the mill produced
$2310 in gold and eleven ounces of silver
from 101 tons of ore. The tailings at this
mine are now successfully cyanided, ef
fecting a saving of 90 per cent of the val
ues. The summer temperature out there
on the desert, l. baa forced a six
weeks' closing of the mill. Work Is pur
sued, however, in the shafts and tunnels,
in which there is a strong and constant
natural draught. The Ivanhoe, Brook
lyn and Whit.: Star are among the other
operating mines in the region. The hot
weather has forced all the dry washers in
the placers to quit.
The formation of an asphalt trust in
the East the other day closely concerns
the big asphalt industry of California.
The capital is $20,000,000, and the Asphalt
Company of America proposes to control
all the important asphalt mines of the
world and the use of the products in pav
ing, roofing, etc. The Trinidad mines are
in its grasp. The Ateatraz Asphalt Pav
ing Company of Los Angeles Â»will join
the trust. It controls the output of the
big Alcatraz mines of Santa Barbara
County, which, however, are owned by
another company controlled by the
Crockers.
Large hydraulic operations are to be
started at Orleans Bar on the Klamash
River. In Humboldt County,
Madera expects to have a smelter. A
committee is at work raising funds to
aid the enterprise.
The Bell mine of Tuolumne County,
which has been opened to a depth of 200
feet, is being unwatered.
The American Quartz Milling Cnmpan /
of San Francisco has bought the Anvil
can quartz mine at French Gulch. Shast}l
County, and will reopen and extensive!]
develop the property. The mine has \
ti n-stamp mill and in the past has yielded
$95,000.
Tuolumne County is the great pocket
mining region of the State as well as one
of th<-- best vein mining- districts of the
mother lode. Many good strikes are re
ported every week. During the week sev
eral bunches of gold were taken out of
the Hudson and Birney mine near Colum
bia Hill, aggregating $1700, a pretty good
week's product. Several other strikes at
Yankee Hill and vicinity were reported.
The Zlndara pocket mine has been leased
to San Francisco men, who will go to
work at once.
The Alta copper mine in the Txjw Divide
district of T>il Norte County, owned by
Oakland people, is reported as soon to be
sold. In the early sixties this mine was
Quite extensively worked. A number of
copper prospects are being developed In
T>.l Norte County, and there, as t-lsn

It is reported that the Atlas mine, an

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Ft Is the boast of the Russian navy that
the turret ship Peresvlet, of 12.674 tons.
huilt at St. Petersburg In 1895-98, is con
structed of domestic material alone.
The Ohlnese cruiser Hai-Chi left Sheer
ness on June 9 fnr China. The vessel was
built at EHswick and made 24 knots on her
trial trip. She will fly the British flag on
her initial voyage until delivered to and
paid for by the Chinese Government.
The Frrnrh torpedo boat Lansquerret.
built at Nantes in JS93, has, after repeated
trials, turned out a decided failure. Her
contract speed of 26 knots was not
reached and she was rejected. The build
ers put in a new set of boilers in order to
Increase the horsepower, but at a recent
trial the boat did not even make 20
knots and she is apparently a dismal fail
ure.
The Russian armored gunboat Khrabry
w i- begun at St. Petersburg in UK, bin
still lies in an unfinished condition at
Kronstadt. The vessel is only Imm tons
and with 2^42 horsepower made 14.5 knots.
It has a belt 5 inches thick, tapering to 3
inches at the ends, and a protective deck
1â  - inches thick on the slope. The battery
consists of two S-inch and one 6-inch guns,
and the Khrabry is evidently an experi
ment subject to radical modifications be
fore she is duplicated.
The new drydock at T'chidacho, near
Yokohama. v,as opened on May 1. it is
available for naval vessels, being 483 feet
8 inches lone on the blocks, allowing ships
of over 500 feet to dock. The width of en
trance is 93 feet 8 inches, and at bottom
75 feet 5 Inches, and the water over the
sill at ordinary spring tide is a little over
71 feet. A smaller dock adjoining this
new one and owtied by the Yokohama
Dock Company was built some years ago
and will accommodate ships of 364 feet
length.
Every navy has its "black sheep" ves
sels, that is. ships which, not withstanding
constant tinkering do not come up to th
requirements, or in other ways fail to in
spire confidence. In the British navy the
Penelope, Ajax. Rupert, Neptune, and
even the Nile and Trafalgar, are in that
category. Franc-? has the Mnnnus, Hochc
and Magenta as pronounced black, and
â everal more of doubtful utility. In the
Russian navy there is the Peter Vrliky,
Catherina II and the Russia, and in the
Austrian navy is the Kronprinzessin Ste
phanie. In the United States navy the
Texas is not so much of a success as the
builders would like the public to believe,
for at the nattle off Santiago the decks
were ripped up by the concussion of the
ship's guns, and in this respect the Texas
shares the defects of the Russia.
The French armored cruiser and com
merce destroyer Jeanne d'Arc. launched at
Toulon on June 8, Is attracting consider
able attention in naval circles on account
of its peculiarities and innovations on es
tablished practices. She has a complete
water line belt, is 11.270 tons and with tri
ple screws of 28,500 horsepower is to make
23 knots and 1!> knots under natural
draught. . She is fitted with 48 Dv Temple
water tube boilers, arranged to burn pe
troleum, of which the ship can stow 20
tons. The London Engineer pronounces
the Jeanne d'Arc is more wonderful than
useful. _____
The paymaster's chest on hoard the
British cruiser Niobe was robbed last
January of about 15600, and the police and
naval authorities have been unable to fas
ten the crime upon any one. In conform
:ty to naval usage ;;n example had to be
made of somebody, and Fleet Paymaster
J. A. Wood was court-martialed June 16,
charged with embezzling the missing mon
ey and also with having negligently per
formed his duty by want of care of the
money entrusted to his charge. He plead
ed not guilty to the first charge, and de
clined to plead to the second. The court
acquitted him on the charge of embezzle
ment, but found him guilty of negligence
and adjudged the officer to forfeit all sen
iority as Beet paymaster and be dismissed
his ship.
The fire at the Armstrong. WhitWOTth
& Co. ordnance works. Elswick. on the
night of Juno 11 last destroyed three large
sbopa and a great quantity of machinery
and guns, pun carriages, projectiles, en
gines, cranes, tools and stores to the val
ue of about $1,000,000, and laying idle 2000
men of the 20,000 employed by the firm.
Two of the shops were 900 feet in length
and 108 feel wide, and contained guns in
various stages of completion and turn
tables for heavy ships. The third and
smaller building contained projectiles. It
will take some time to know to a certain
ty the extent of damage to the guns, and
Sir Andrew Noble estimates that the erec
tion of new shops and introduction of new
machine tools would take from three to
four months. The delivery of armaments
to ships would, however, take consider
able more time, and in the case of the Al
bany, completing for the United States
navy, likely cause a delay of over six
months. ___^___________

Brethren. he ye followers: of me. and mark
them that walk so that ye shall have us
for an example, for our conversation is in
heaven .-Phillppians 111. xvli:2o.
The sienirioanre of these words of St.
Paul are brought before our minds to
day with all possible pomp an I splendor.
They wer* addressed originally by the Kreat
apostle to his beloved brethren lately con- â 
verted in Macedonia; in whose salvation
he was intensely interested. These words,
though uttered 1900 years ago. have lost
nono of their original force, but with the
pacing years are looked upon more and
rnor^ as the root and foundation of Chris-
In St. Tanl's words to-day we have the
lesson of a lovine father to his beloved
children, ursrinir them to that sentiment
and that act which we dÂ»s!^nite as prayer.
St. Paul insisted upon prayer by all
Christians, because it !s th^Â» divinely ap
pointed means to obtain the end of our
existence here on earth; id. -iv. our sel
vatton. Prayer Is in this relation second
only in importance to salvation itself.
'â QUO VADIf HIS THEME.
At the Church of St. Francis the Sun
day within the octave, or the feast of
Saints Peter and Paul, was celebrated by
high mass in the mprning. The member.-'
of the Holy Childhood, the Children of
Mar) ami the Holy Angel sodalities re
ceived holy communion at the mass held
at half-past 7 o'clock. Rev. Father C.-ira
her delivered the sermon in the evening!
choosing as his subject "Quo Vadis, or
St. Peter on the Appian Way." His tpxt
was, "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock
I will build my church and the pates of
hell shall not prevail.!' The father spoke
in part as follows:
The word Peter sis" I a rock and the
great apostle was so-called because liÂ» was
to be the spiritual rock on which our Lord
â¢was to found his church; Before his call
to the flpnstleship. he was railed Simon,
which slenifies. "hearing with acceptance."
This name was most appropriate because
Peter, not only heard the call to the apostle
ship, but accepted it instantly and cheer
fully
The great apostle was remarkable for his
burning zeal for his master and his cause.
It was a zeal that forced him to cast him
self unto the waters when our Lord ap
peared walking en the sea of Galilee It
was a zeal that impelled him to cut off
th* ear of Mar â  when our Lord was cap
tured In the garden of Gethsemane. It was
a zeal that prompted him to s-t out for
Rome, the mistress of the world, in order
to conquer It to Christ. On one occasion,
his zeal abated, when he fIM from the
persecution of Nero. He had not proceeded
far outside th<* wails of the city, on the
Apptan way. when he met our Lord. To
the question of St. Peter. "Domlne quo
vadis?" our I^ord replied. "Vado Iterum oru
ciflpi." This gentle rebuke of the Savior
touched the apostle so deeply and mad" him
po ashamed of his cowardice that he re
traced his steps to Rome, where he was
afterward crucified.
In his sermon. Rev. Carraher dwelt on
the historical association connected with
this spot where the Savior and St. Peter
met.

It r is clear that St. Peter merited the of

greatness of his faith and of his love, in
which virtues he stood foremost among the
apostles. After St. Peter's shameful denial
of his Master, thrice repeated, all the mer

benedict at last."
Anderson met his bride in a romantic
manner. Chief Master at Arms Murray
brought his wife out from the East
about a month ago and he advertised
for a house convenient to the Oakland
water front. Mrs. Anderson, formerly
Rodgers, owns considerable property
in Oakland and she paid a visit to the
Pensacola to lease one of her houses
to the chief master at arms. As she
was stepping from the boat to the
landing stage she lost her footing and
would have gone overboard had it not
been for Chief Carpenter's Mate An
derson. That little incident led to a
warm friendship and finally to yester
day's wedding.
Anderson stands very high with
Captain Glass, commandant of the
naval training station, and when the
former askrd permission to have the
wedding take place aboard ship it
was readily granted. Furthermore,
the commandant placed his own rooms
on the Pensacola al tho disposal of
the bridal party and after the cere
mony sent them away in his private
launch.

DISCOURSED ON LIBERTY.
Rev. W. E. Dugan delivered an interest
ing discourse on "Liberty" last night as
a prelude to his regular Sunday evening
sermon to the members of the Stewart
Memorial Church. In part he said:
Every fiftieth year with the Jew was a
year of jubilee and liberty. Their liberty
was a social rather than a political lib
erty. I would as we celebrate our national
liberty on next Tuesday that we also could
rejoice in social libertyâ liberty having
as much meaning to the poor laboring
man as it has for the millionaire and
trust king. Under th" Jewish dispensa
tion there were no multi-millonaires and
trusts nor laboring, poverty-stricken men
who were willing to work, but COUld! not
get it, because men were not allowed for
generations to build trusts at the expense
of the unfortunate workman. Their year
or Jubilee liberty provided against that.
On next Tuesday we will specially be re
minded of the heroism, valor and self-de
nial of our patriotic forefathers. We shall
call back the dark and terrible winter at
Valley Forge, the prints of bleeding feet
on frozen, snowy ground, left by those
who fought with desperation for the free
dom we enjoy to-day. But let us also hold
In mind the valor of our own boys who
have go recently defended that flag with a
valor worthy of the highest respect of all
people. As we remember Washington
crossing the Delaware, let us remember
the California boy speeding across the
broad Pacific. As we rejoice that our
forefathers hurled the British lion back
Into the Atlantic with such force that It
has never dared again to tread our shores
in hostile attitude, let us remember that our
boys have hurled the iron-heeled monster
of tyranny in ignominious defeat, and unite
In one grand hurrah for Old Glory.
Never was the subject of liberty so be
fore our minds as to-day, because of our
relations with the Filipinos. Have we a
right to compel them to submit when they
want us to leave their shores? Are we In
terfering with their liberty by not doing
so? Liberty is only the right to do rightâ
not the privilege of doing as one pleases,
and the Filipino has a right to his desires
only so far as he desires to do right and
live civilly Yes, let Old Glory wave over
the Philippines: let our flag be raised In
every part of the world, till all the world
has learned to taste of our glorious repub
lic's liberty.
Anfelic Ministrations.
"Angelic Ministrations" was the subject
of Rev. D. V. Bowen's sermon before the
congregation of the New Jerusalem
Church last evening. In the course of its
delivery he said:
The angels are spiritual beings who once
were men and women on this or some other
earthâ men and women like ourselves, only
having greater wisdom and love and power.
Numerous Instances are recorded in the
Bible, where angels have amieared to men in
this world, whose spiritual sight has been
opened. Those who saw them were not trans
ferred to some distant place, but standing in
ti.e same spot, were permitted to see their an
geilc associates by the opening of their spirit
ual sight. (Instances servant of Elisha, and
the shepherds of nethlehem.) ,
The spiritual world, with Its inhabitants, Is
not at a distance from us, but as to our spir
itsâwe are ever present in it. Good ami evil
influencen come to us according; to the charac
ter Of our livesâ depending upon what we love
best. â¢'â¢â¢ ;

"How Republics Liv? r.nd Die.''
Rev. Dr. Charles E. Locke held service
â  in his own church yesterday, having re
turned from his two months evening wor

course in the evening was on "How Re

May Live Forever."
His text was, "Righteousness exalteth
a nation; but sin is a reproach to any peo
ple." Dr. Locke said in part:
! As we approach our national festival day our
[ hearts are filled with grateful thanksgiving for
i material prosperity: for home securtiy and for

; religious freedom. Peace, plenty, happiness.
i faith and mercy abound among us as a peo
ple On this Sabbath evening, almost on the
ove of our nation's birthday anniversary, it
will be profitable for us to reverently inquire
"Why republics die," and endeavur to dis
cover what are the Influences which dlsln
; tejcrate a strong nation, and what are the
â  forces which exalt and perpetuate a people.
History is a candid teacher, and if we are but
honest pupils the disasters of the past may be
successfully averted.
j A republic Is the divine ideal of government.
The commonwealth of Israel, under Moses and
! Joshua and the judges, was Interrupted dur
| ing the day of Samuel because the people de
manded a King, that they might Imitate the
heathen nation? about them. A government of
the people, for the people, by the people is the
I highest conception of national organization,
, but for Its integrity and perfection must de
: pend upon the probity and virtue of the in
; dividual citizen.
Republics cannot survive when the states
; men become demagogues, when politics Is
corrupted and when true and self-sacriflclnc
patriotism disappears. Athens and Rome and
! Venice and France have taught the world un
mistakable lessons at this point. When laws
cannot be enforced and when officers of the
law connive at criminal Infractions of the
law; when public sentiment cannot he aroused
and does not resent Insult, but consorts with
cruel enemies, then republics speedily disap
pear.

ELECTRICIAN CRUSHED
IN AN ELEVATOR CAGE
George Fulthorp Meets With a Seri

GEORGE FULTHORP. an electrician In the employ of the Fraser Elec
tric Elevator Company, met with an accident yesterday at noon that
may have a fatal termination. He was engaged along with two others
In repairing the elevator In M. Friedman & Co.'s store, 237 Post street,
when the accident occurred.
Fulthorp was in the elevator running It up and down at great speed with
the view of testing it and the two other men were in the hasement. In de
scending the elevator struck the buffers at the bottom of the well with such
force as to loosen the heavy iron grill work on top of the cage and It fell
Upon Fulthorp. crushing him against the side of the elevator. His fellow
workmen heard his cries for help and quickly extricated him from his dan
geroua and painful position. He was conscious but suffering great pain. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital and Dr. Stephen found that his thigh
bone w.is fractured, there was a contusion over the fronta'. hone and lacer
ated wounaÂ« on his chin and right hand. He was also suffering from internal
Injuries of a serious nature. He is a single man and lives in the Hancock
Houfe. 781 Mission street. . .
â¢"Flie tops of these elevators." said one of the men, "are fixed with small
screws and the first violent iar is apt to knock the screws out and the top
falls in Of course a man accustomed to running an elevator is careful not to
allow It to bump too hard against the buffers, but Fulthorp did not have
that experience. The iron grill work weighs probably about 200 pounds.

clairly demonstrated in the afternoon,

ewats, three of which came In one Inning.

l'he crowd in the afternoon was aug
-3 K-nted by a delegation from the Garden
' City, who came up to help out Dalrym
lÂ»le* in coaching. Their assistance waj j
unnecessary, however, for the dust-rais
ing cake-walker had the fireman going
for a lew minutes in the 111 til and the
game was lost and won.
Alter Krug had taken a couple of shots
at the sun, which cost two runs, the lo
cals played an errorless game, but chose
two runs played the mischief. Notwlth
- standing, the gurne was always interest
ing, and at times became intensely excit
ing, particularly In the ninth, when, with
two men out, ODea threw the ball into
the bleacher*, giving a. run that brought
the score to within one of even. The
crowd, which was Tiling out of the grand
: stand, scrambled back to their Beats, but
;a pop fly ended the agony.
Hilderbrandt came to the front as a
slugger, tearing off two doubles and a
tingle out of four times at bat, while
Krug got in a â  race of two-cushion shot;.
Andrews pitched another good game
â  and was fairly well supported, although
Leak-.*, after Fitzpatrick soaked him in
the arm in the sixth inning, had a couple j
â¢<.>f bad spells. It was not to be wondered <
at. however, for the. ball the fireman !
lammed up against him smoked It was bo
hot.
Frisco opened up with two runs. Pyne
was given his base, going to third on
Krng's double. Rile} was gone on a
grounder to Hanlon nd Sullivan hit a hot
one to Leake. who fielded Pyne out at the
plate, KniÃ going to third. Hilderbrandt's
double to ri^ht scored the Doctor and the
German, bur Muller's out at first on An
derson's assist ended the suspense.
The second inning was fraught with
much episode. With one out, Swindells
tvaÂ« safe on Andrews' error of his drive,
a:i'i went to second on Anderson's error,
A bungle by Leake put him over the rub
ber. Then came some fireworks by Krug
when Ban Jose went to bat. Dafrymple
hit to Hennle mid went to second on the
latter's high throw to first. Hanlon sent
nnothÂ«r down to him, and just to show
that his first effort wasn't a marker to
what he could do, Krug shot the ball
clear over into the bleachers. Dalrymple
and Hanloi scored, while Sullivan hunted
for the ball; but couldn't find it. After
that Krug appeared to be satisfied with
his efforts, for he didn't try to outdo
them.
They had Fitz up In the air for a brief I
period In the tilth, just long enough for
them to score three runs. I.ejLke led off
with a single and Andrews sacrificed.
Kent was assisted out at first by Riley
but when McGucken exploded a double '
scoring l.cake, Dalrymple and ODea
opened their vocal batteries â â¢.: d the Fire
man become visibly affected. He walked
Graham to first and Anderson sent the
Professor and Unhappy home with an
other double. O'Neil and Swindells
sparred for time until Fitz climbed down
the fire escape, and Dalrymple stopped
further trouble by fouling out.
Swindells scored for Frisco in the sev
enth on Leake's wide throw, Fitz's out at
first and Pyne's long fly to right. San
Jose's run in the eighth was made by
Hanlon, who was given his base, stole
second and scored on â¢ <â  I j.-.i double.
With two men out In the ninth, Pyne
hit a hot one to O'Dea. who fielded the
bail brilliantly and then duplicated Krug'M
best throw by shootlngiii across the dia
mond Into the bleachers Pyne making the
circuit. Krug settled it, however with a
pop fiy. The scores:

SCULLERS AND SAILORS TAKE PORT
IN THE INDEPENDENCE DAY SPORTS
THR aquatic part of the Fourth of ,
July celebration was held yesterday,
and was highly successful. Mission
Street Wharf >'o. 2 and the Howard
and Folsom street wharves were
crowded with spectators viewing with
much Interest the barge and skiff raee 3
arranged by the regatta committee of the
Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union. There were five events.
and ail but one proved productive of In
teresting contests.
The lirst Item on the programme was
the junior outrlgged skiff race, for which
there were four entries. M. J. Breen of â¢
the South Ends took the Inside station,
nearest to the wharves, George Lewis of ,
the Alamedas had the inside center po
sition, Warner Lubbock of the Alamedas
was next to the outside and George Col
lopy of the Pioneers had outside place,
lireen secured the best of the start. At .
Folsom street wharf W. Lubbock retired.
Lewis turned the stake first, and M.
Breen and Collopy a little later. When â¢
half way home Breen'e left arm gave
out and he retired, leaving Lewis and
Collopy to finish. Collopy beinK farther
out was helped by the tide, but Lewis
stuck parnely to his work and rowed a ,

beat him out by about f<>ur lengths. The
winner's time was 7 minutes IT. seconds.
For the Junior barge rac- there was
two contesting crewsâ the Ariels and the
Dolphins. The Ariel crew, made up of
E McDonough. bow; C. Wilson, No. 2;
A. Hauehton. No. 3: E. Lynch, stroke,

6 minutes and 15 seconds..
The senior outrigged skiff race brought
out Dr. C. C. Dennis of the South Ends,
who had the outside station; < '. 1.. Ochs
of the Pioneers, who took second place,
mid W O. Patch of the Dolphins, who
whs Inside. The start was even, and
none of the three had much advantage to
m. Then a large steamer came out
from one of the wharves, and Patch, In
stead of going astern of her. went for his
Btakeboat, which he fouled, thereupon re
tiring from the race. After the turn Ochs
had a good lead, and. pulling strongly,
Beemed a sure winner. Dennis kept
at a steady pace, however, and finally
beat Ochs, who steered a poor course, by
one length, after a close contest

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALI,, MONDAY, JULY 3, 1899.
Divisions 1 and 2 of the Naval Battalion
of the National Guard, the former in a
ten-oared cutter, with P. J. Murphy as
cockswain, and the latter in a nix-oared
gig, with Fred Sutton as helmsman. As
might have been expected, the ten-oar
had the race almost from the start, the
six-oar being distanced.
The event that was looked forward to
with most interest was the senior barge
race, for which the Alamedas, the Uni
versity of California and the scratch crew
were "entered. The scratch crew was
made up of if. Wilson, bow; G. Laws >n,
No. 2; F. O. N.-ill. No. 3: A. W. Pape,
stroke, and Roy West, cockswain, and
had the inside station. The University of
California crew had the center place, and
was composed of James Hopper, bow; A.
D. Smith, No. 2; Ray Fryer, No. 3, and
F. Waggershauser, stroke. The Alameda
crew was composed of J. Lewis, bow; \V.
<; Hansen, No. 2; A. C. Webb, No. 3, and
F. Avers, stroke. The university men
started rather raggedly, but soon
settled down to their work. When they
came up to their stake, however, which
was next to the outside one, they found
the AJameda boat already there and could
not round the mark until the Alameda;*
had rounded and started away. Even
after both crews had straightened out for
home the fouling continued. Meanwhile
the scratch crew, with clear water befor â¢
them, rowed away and won as they! liked.

WITH BAT AND BALL.
Pacific Cricketers Are Beaten
by Alamedas by a Narrow
Margin.
The Pacific Cricketers seem to be pur
sued by a demon of ill-luck. They had 121
runs to make yesterday to beat the Ala
meda team, and, though they had ob- j
tamed 109 of these when the fifth wicket
fell, they were all out for 117, or four less
than the required number. This result
was largely due to the fact of J. Myers j
getting unfortunately run out, when he
was well set and scoring freely, and
partly also to the fact that the team was
two men short.
The Alameda men went first to the bat,
G. J. Baugh being top scorer with 35.
Sewell bowled quite successfully, taking ;
5 wickets at a cost of about 12 runs j
apiece. Coles took 2 wickets for 21 runs.
C. Simmonds scored 52, not out for the Pa- i
cifies, but he received little help except
from J. Myers, who made 27, and F. !
Sewell, who contributed 13. The full !

Grass Fires Near Novato.
NOVATO, July 2.â Fire has started in
the dry grass on the hills east of Novato
and is threatening the hay crop which is
drying- in the fields. Fire fighters are
working in squads to protect the fields
and check the flames, but at a late hour
to-night the fire seemed to be burning as
fiercely as ever. It is supposed that the
fire started from the carelessness of some
hunter.
work for the whltehalls. The course was
from Powell-street wharf to and round
' Blossom Rock buoy, thence to and round
a Btakeboat anchored off Powell-street
wharf, thence to and round a stakeboat
off Fort Point, thence home across the
starting line. It was a reach to and from
Blossom Rock buoy, a beat out to Fort
Point and a run home with spinnakers
set. Boat No. 2, after rounding Blossom
Rock buoy carried away part of her run
ning- rigging, and retired from the race.
The following six boats completed tire
course without mishap and won the prizes
In the following order:
Golden Shore, No. 7, sailed by James Sen

Stewart Menzles, No. 3, sailed by David
Crow ley.

Faugh-a-ballaugh, No. 1, sailed by "William
Clark.
Robert J. Tobin, No. 6, sailed by Maurice
Behan.
Chief Lees, No. S, sailed by Joseph Martin.
The race began at 1:30 p. m., and as the
tide turned soon after 2 o'clock the boats
came home on the Hood, and made great
time. The races were watched by a large
crowd of spectators on Powell-street
wharf, and were closely followed by par
ties on board the tugs Governor Mark

In charge of Percy Henderson, the second
of G. C. Phillips and the last of C.
Fisher. The officials In charge of the race
were Percy Henderson, referee; James
McGowan and William Gateley, Judges.
At about 2 p. m. the Italian fishing
boats started for a race over a longer
course than the whitehalls. From Powell
ptreet wharf they reached over to the
Berkeley shoal buoy, round it and back
to Powell-street wharf, thence they beat
to windward out to Fort Point, and
thence ran home to the starting line. By
the time the little fellows came to beat
out to Fort Point the tide was flooding
strongly and the task was a hard one.
Once round the windward buoy, however,
it was simply a romp home. The boats
finished In the following order:
Mondo Nuovo, No. 2, sailed by Captain E.
Varcone.
Sempra Avantl,. No. 1, sailed by Captain
Rosso.
Isabella, No. 5, galled by Captain F. Onorato.

Young America, the black and whit-;

the confidence of hl.s tupportei by rump-
Ing homo a winner iii the final rou of
the open stake at Union Coursing Park
yesterday. He met Master Clair, another
black and white dog, which had also per
formed consistently throughout the day.
The lirst hare to which the brace of Heat
hounds were slipped blended in color with
the dry grass, and the dogs ran about
aimlessly, unsighted.
Their attendants caught them before
any harm had been done. They were soon
â¢lipped again, and it was evident that
Young America had the pace. He Id in
a straight run-up and killed, winning
handily.
There was a long line of bettors with
red tickets at each pool box, waiting to
cash in when Kosie Clair defeated Flush
for the linal of the Consolation stakes.
Flush was favorite at odds of 3 to ">. hav
ing been running well all day. The dog.s
ran as if coupled together for some dis
tance, when Rosie Clair led up, securing
the first and second turns. Flush scored
one turn, when Kosie Clair killed, win
ning the course.
There were several unusually Ion'?
courses. Victor King, a 3 to 1 short-endÂ«*r,
beat Statesman. The latter scored many
points at the start, but the King finally
secured possession of the hare and won.
Benicia Boy and Terrona had a desperate
chase, which led them all over the Held,
Benicia Boy winning ultimately. The bet
ting was even money owing to the fine
showing made by Terrona with Rollicking
Airs when they met in the first round.
There will be coursing at Union Park
to-morrow, the card being a fifty-six-dog

the same as on Sunday. The results in

Are Delivered.
CHURCHES GAYLY DECORATED
REV. E. A. WOODS TALKS TO OLD
SOLDIERS.
Highly Interesting Thoughts on the
Birthday by Rev. Drs.
Wilson, Brown, Locke
and Hemphill.
Patriotism and kindred topics formed
the themes of many ministers in. last
night's services at the churches. The spirit
that pervades the anniversary of the na
tion's birthday permeated the glowing
words which told of love for our country.
At the First Baptist Church a Jars-?
audience, among whom were many mem
bers of various Grand Army posts, lis
tened to an eloquent and stirring address
by Rev. E. A. Woods. The church was
prettily decorated with greens and bunt-
Ing-, and the pulpit was draped with a
beautiful and very large American May.
The pastor spoke in part as follows:
It was with our fathers, is with the
children of Israelâ to them patriotism and
piety were identical. In the foundation of
our national life, love of country and lV
ligion were the same.
We have me to our cr'at national holi
day, the Fourth of July, and we .ink. what
does it rn^an- thf day and flag". We
have developed from an insignificant na
tion to a great Â»e->p!e; from 4.000.000 to
60,400,000. Lot us see what these things
meant in our infancy.
The day and the flag stood out as symbols
of the great struggle of " â â â¢ Revolution;
they became the emblems of our national
lifo This spirit declined in the pr Â«Tesa i
'-' the '"â â¢â  ' struggle over slavery, but In [
that srfent and awful contest the day and
the ;\icr gained ;i new meaning:.
A litt'e more than n year ago our sym
path!Â»-;< and our consciousness as a na- [
t'.in 'vere again aroused. The nation de
rr.and-Â»1 that something )â¢â  done for the '
Buffering Cubans. in the motive which
prompted our Interference and in our ;
splendid victories, one of which was won on ;
the nation's natal dny, the day and the
flag acquired a yet deeper significance. !
WHAT CONSTITUTES
A PATRIOT?
In his sermon on "True Patriotism" last
evening Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the 'all
fornia-street M. E. Church discourse.!
brilliantly on what constitutes the true
and tlio sham patriot. Among the strong
Hintements made by him are the follow
ing:
True patriotism is based on the foundation
of good citizenship. It Is the passion which
aims to serve or.c's country, either in de
fending- hs honor abroad, or upholding and
maintaining its laws and Institutions at
home. ShaH we honor thru man with the
ti'.le of patriot because with loud voice and
foul tongue he curses the foreign foe and
f-hr.uts himself hoarse before a bulletin
b"aril. when for years thi? same man has
u**n living in open defiance of the laws of
hi* own State and eminent?
Think -nu, I call these â  en good soldiers
and patriots, who. having donned the uni
form of T.'ncle Sam. stagger about our
streets, spend their days in saloons and
th*-!r nights In brawls, fighting, stabbing,
sh.-.'tin^. murdering each other or inoffen
sive citizens? No. they are a gang of cow
ardly criminals and in place of wearing
th" blue of Uncle ..am. ought to have the
stripes of â  m Quentin.
Th- law abiding citizen, who hangs out a
bit of bunting, keeps sober and reads the
declaration of Independence to his children
â to himself if he be not blessed with
familyâ will do more a thousand fold to
honor his country and stimulate patriotic
feelings than the man who, with no more
Americanism than a Chinaman, lets of a
bundle of fire-crackers, drinks a barrel of
beer, disgraces the day by his drunken stag
gering, and makes the -â¢.i hideous with
his noise.
-_c true patriot will nnt dodge Dr. Dodge,
but take his medicine in form of a just
personal assessment without resorting to
fraud or perjury. If elected to public- place
he win not serve upon the principle that
".a public office is a private snap." rob the
City or State Treasury and award municipal
contracts to the linn giving the largest
"rake off. He will take a sincere inter
est and have an honest concern for the
moral and educational institutions of his
country.
BELIEVES IN PEACE.
At Calvary Presbyterian Church Rev.
Tm\ John Hemphill spoke on the subject
of "Patriotism.';! His text was taken from
Exodus xii:2<s. "What mean ye by this
service?" Said the pastor:
This question was asked by the Hebrew
chlMren of their fathers concerning the
cflebration of the Pentaeost. just â - our
chiMren to-day a?k ,- ab ml the Fourth of
July. T^Pt us be sure that we remember
this fe?tal day in the right way. National
glori fixation is not the right way. We re
nifmt>er it aright when we Rive the glory
to the God of our fathers.
â¢ The pa?tor referred briefly to the lea.l
lnp events In the country's history, and
while lie Justified war, and especially the
recent conflict with Spain, yet he quoto.l
with fervor the memorable words of Gen
eral Sherman, "War is hell." "I believe
In peace," hf said, "and the glorious day
is enmintr when international arbitration
will be substituted for cruel war."
NEGROES AS WARRIOR'S.
Rev. T. Brown Bpoke of the "Negro s-.
a Warrior Patriot" at the Starr
| in M. B. <"hurch last night. A
large c< nxregation listened to the ititer
. eloqu< i â¢ discourse. He said in
part:
Hannibal, a net,-;- â  was one of the great
[ulty. Tonsatnt, the
prÂ»ir â : i, 'h agh cap
tured by Napoleon's tr-sachery, yet died
a hero for country. No one ever
thought that when twenty negroes were
brought t" America In 1820 that the sons
and daughters of those men would be the

ROBERT GRIEVE PASSES
AWAY IN THIS CITY
WEALTHY HONOLULU PRINTER
GOES TO HIS REWARD.
Weil Known in San Francisco and in
the Islands, Where He Had
Resided Many Years.
Robert Grieve of Honolulu died in this
city on Saturday at the age of 69. He was
ona of America's old-time printers. His
associations with the craft In the United
States and in the Hawaiian Islands both
confer distinction on his memory. Born
in Scotland he went when quite young
to Canada West long before the Domin
ion had an existence. Before he attained
his majority he came to the United
States and forthwith trained as an
American. He was a printer in the New
York Tribune office, as such becoming an
adept In deciphering the grotesque hiero
glyphics of Horace Greeley. Mr. Grieve
was also one of Joseph Medill's printers*
at the birth of the Cleveland Leader.
Going to the Hawaiian Islands some
where along in the forties or fifties, he
made his jnark there as a printer and
newspaper publisher. He was owner of
the Hawaiian Gazette, now the oldest ex
isting English newspaper in the. islands.
Having acquired a competence through
his industry he sold the Gazette in LBB7
and retired from active business. He re
sumed business as a book and job printer
a couple of years later. He leaves a prof
itable establishment under th*.- manage
ment of his son, W. L. Grieve, whom no
brought up to the trade.
Mr. Grieve was one of the most highly
esteemed citizens of Honolulu, a thor
oughly square and Independent man. He
came to San Francisco a few weeks ago
to receive special treatment for his siglit,
which for some years had been steadily
failing. Mrs. Grieve accompanied him
with their daughter, Mrs. James L. Mc-
Lean, wife of the secretary of the Interisl
and Steam Navigation Company. The de
ceased leaves much valuable real eslato
in Honolulu in addition to his printing
establishment.
FRACAS IN A SALOON.
A general saloon mix-up occurred in the
i suloon kept by John Byrne at 12S New
Montgomery street yesterday afternoon.
As a ref-ult, three combatants. E. F.
Tully, aged CO years, residing at 100 Sec
| ond strec-t; James O'Brien, otherwise
j known as "rug." and residing at 114 Na-
I tonia street, and the proprietor of the
j liquor dispensary were ail treated at the
| city hospital for gashes and bruises, and
the two former lucked up at the Central
Police Station.
Tully came to the saloon with hip "can"
and ordered it filled with beer. This
Byrne proceeded to do. but in the mean
while his customer became involved in a
1 dispute with O'Brien. Tully drew a
j knife ar.d O'Brien lost no timp In getting
: behind the bar. where he seized a ver
i mouth butttle and pitched Into the com
i bat. Byrne, realizing that his cordial was
! iikelv to be spilled in the fracas, pulled
!up his sleeeves and made the affair
three-handed. The men fought tor some
time and each received severe cuts anil
bruises aooul the head and body.
Byrne was taken to the Harbor Hos
; pital and O'Brien and Tully were booked
at tho Central Police Station after their
wounds had been dressed at the Receiv
ing Hospital.

fact that L. R. Stockwell and Ma

about; namely, that Timothy Dan
iel Frawley and his company and (I wish
the linotype had italics for that last
| "and 1 :) Blanche Bates would soon be
! playacting in that very same theater. On
| Thursday the 13th inst. the opening takes â 
; place. Mr. Frawley is superstitiously
j enamored of the number 13; hence the
! midweek opening.
[1 sec ms we can't lose the Frawleys any
more than they can lose us. Here the orig
| inal thirteen of them made their start;
and, after deserting us for the joys of i
Eastern applause and the pains of East
ern summertime, it is here they come
back to bouse in the California and com
, plete their circle of San Francisco's first
theaters. The Frawley company
has won a reputation that is more than
, Western, and Blanch- Bates well, she is !
j now acknowledged to be what 1 had the
j audacity to rail nor some time before she .
stirred up the adjectives of the New fork
and Washington critics: one of the few
absolute artists on the American Btage.
It was her performance in "The Dancing
Girl" that called out my superlatives, and,
happily enough, it is as Prusilla Ives in '
; this same play that she will make her
| reappearance in the California on the
' Thursday night of the 13th inst.
Providing we don't get as much of it j
as wÂ« arÂ» having now in the operatic ;
line, there is nothing like good honest !
competition in the theatrical business.
With the return of Frawley, Miller will
not be the only blossom on the bough;
there will be two playhouses instead of
one that a sensitive person may enter (
with safety. Ffawley's list looms well: !
; Blanche Bates. Mary Van Buren. Kath
leen Chambers. Edith Miller. Rose Whit
ney. May Starkf-y. Mrs. F. M. Bates,
Augustus Cook, Harrington Reynolds,
Charles W. King. Alfred Hiekman, Harry
Turnbull, Frank Wilmot, J. R.
Armory, J. B. Hollis, George Gaston,
Frank Mathieu and T. Daniel himself.
| For pieces they have, besides "The
Dancing Girl." "Madame Sans Gene,"
"The Master of Woodbarrow," "An
I Enemy to the Kin*;" and some new ones,
whose titles Mr. Frawley ele.-ts to
[ keep secret until his arrival next Wednes
-1 day. The season will last six weeks at
least, possibly ight. hut Miss Bates
' ', will not be fu-re all of that period, as she
\ has to return to New York in time for ;
â  rehearsals in the leading role of Zang- I
: will's Ghetto play.
How history inverts itself! Several
years ago when the Frawleys |
were gathering in all kinds of wealth and
flowers the Frohmans sent Herbert K-l

nia. Xow. Mr. Frohman is prospering at j

L may deal briefly and gently with Mr.
â¢ Stockwell's season of one week. "A Mid- j

accompaniment. Realism finds expression j
; in the externals; real children, real sleds
: and several instances of almost reai dia-
The play could have been written
nowhere but in America; but even so,
there is no particular reason why we
: should be proud of it. Still, it has consid- '

'no longer young, are characteristically j
sappy, with a little wisdom tucked away >
in many of themâ and anyway, why go
' | back on a piece that we voted pretty j
j good entertainment when it was young? â 
The same applies to Mr. Stockwell. J, for
i ! one, would like to see him ohange a bit, j

formidable as the minister's sister; and '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, 31OXDAY, JULY 3, 1899.
EARLY MORNING
BURGLAR LANDED
BY THE POLICE
Jesse Russell Neatly
Captured.
STOLEN WATCHES RECOVERED
DOWNFALL OF A WELL-KNOWN
YOUNG CLERK.
Enters the Room of J. W. Fagely in
Central Bank Building and
When Cornered by De
tectives Confesses.
Oakland Office San Francisco <""all,
908 Broadway. July 2.
Jesse Russell, aged 20 years, and resid- ;
Ing with his parents at 517 Eleventh
street, was cleverly arrested at an early
hour this morning and languishes in the ,
fitv Prison hooked for burglary. The
arrest was effected about an hour after
the commission of the crime and the pris
oner, after much reluctance, confessed
bis guilt.
Shortly before 5 oYlock the room of J.
\V. Fapely In the Central Hank buildinpr
was entered by a burglar and two gold ,
watches were stolen. Fagely and an- j
other man were asleep in the room at the j
time and the movements of the intruder j
aroused Fagely. who immediately arose!
and the burglar fled. The latter was just
in the act of going through Fagely's j
trousers, the pockets of which contained
a considerable sum of money.
Fagely immediately dressed and noti
fied the police. With the description
given by him Officers Stahle and Lynch j
set out on a still hunt and shortly after 6
o'clock a man answering the description
was seen standing in a doorway on Elev
enth Street, near Washington. When
placed under arrest he gave his name as
Jesse Russell and with a cynical smile
remarked that he had heard the police |
were looking for him; that he had called
at the City Prison to Bee about it. but had ,
found the place locked.
Russell stoutly protested his innocence
until cornered by the officers at the City
Prison afterward, when he broke down
and acknowledged that he was the bur
glar, and thai the two stolen gold watchew
could be found on the roof of the Henry
House on Ninth street, between Washing
tun and Broadway. Later the officers re
covered the timepiece s.
Russell is well known about town. He
is of respectable parentage and fairly
well educated. He has been employed as
clerk in several local stores, but his
downfall is attributed to certain asso- !
dates of a shady character.
Neglected Opportunities.
! Rev. J. George Gibson preached an able !
i discourse on "Neglected Opportunities" â 
before the congregation of the Emmanuel
Baptist Church last night. He said in
I part:
Opportunities to do more and be more come !
|to every human being. Some lives are more !
j fortunate than others. Some have more
' chances, hut most people have opportunities, i
j These opportunities, whether great or small, j
i prove what people are. Great people are not
; always people with a wonderful amount of
I genius, but people who improve their chances.
Success In life is very much a matter of wis
dom. Men of splendid power fail because they |
, do not take advantage of the incoming tide.
j The ordinary men are the men who rule thÂ»
I world. Men who know how to grasp the occa- ;
; sion are the leading men. This gift is often
times greater than mere learning.
No opportunity should be despised. We never
can tell how the small will lead on to the great, j
or the little will lead out to the much. Small
seeds contain treat trees. Little streams
broaden out to great rivers. The small oppor
tunity of we use It may be the first step on i
I the ladder the most of which at present is out ;
1 of sight. Many a boy by falling to keep an .
appointment has lost a good situation.
Don't say you have no opportunities. That
i spirit will keep you from seeing them. Hoy
life of to-day Is defective in Its eyesight. Blind
ness to see opportunities Is one of the diseases
of to-day. The boys are waiting for great op
portunities. They will never come as lone as
we Blight the little ones.

to work the ground on an extensive scale,

CORRIGAN MAY BE
MADE A CARDINAL
NEW YORK! July 2.â A World cable
from Rome says: Tie World correspond
ent asked the Pope's c-hirf priva- secre
tary, Monsignor Angeli. to-day, if he
ihoupht it likeiy. as some newspapers
i.t\. announced, that Archbishop Ireland
will be promoted .o a Cardinalate.
"If the Pope decides to create another
American Cardinal." Monsipnor Ange.i
answered, "the choice will fall. I think,
upon Monsignor Corrigan, Arcnbishop of
New York. The i ope holds Monsignor
Ireland in higrh esteem, but his promotion
to be a Cardinal migrht offend the feehners
of the majority of the American Catn-
Cardlnal Svampa has been in Rome
twice within the last few weeks and has
had lontr conferences with the Pope. Car
dinals Svampa and Cotti are considered
the strongest candidates for successor to
Leo Xlfl. The last time cardinal
guampa came here he was called by the
Pope The conferences were probably up
on succession. The World correspondent
inquired of Msrr. AngelJ who. in the opin
ion of the Vatican prelates, are the two
cardinals the Pone created in petto with
out jnii'iincing- their names.
Mer Angell answered that it is impos-
Sible to know the secrets of the Pope but
he supposes one of the cardinals is .<lur.
Del volpe, major donv> of the Pope, and
the "thf-r Mgr. Casanova, archbishop of
Santiago, Chile.

The Eve of the Glorious Fourth
THE glorious Fourth will arrive to- j
morrow on schedule time. Its ap- |
proach has been marked for weeks |
by the detonation of the torpedo
" and the crack of the redhead at the
hands of the small boy. Ita brief stay
will be the signal for a continuous fusillade
of explosives and a pyrotechnic display
that will pale the stars. Behind it. out of
the noisest twenty-four hours in the year,
will emerge some small boys, powder- ,
burned and minus some useful parts of
themselves, but filled with that youthful
patriotism that, refusing to be surfeited j
In any one day, will insist on bursting !
tl eir last torpedo, firing their ultimate
cracker and setting off their final sky
rockei before they consider the Fourth |
properly ended.
The city has been putting: on its best
nfrs to grace the nation's birthday, ajid
the result is simply beautiful. Gay bunt-
Ing and starry flags fly across the streets
and from many buildings; the ships in
the harbor are decked with all the colors |
!r. their lockers; stores, banks, markets
and hotels are gay with the fluttering^ of
t he red, white and blue, the whole mak- j
ing the most comprehensive, spontaneous I
n ever seen in Pan Francisco.
Although yesterday was the 2d of July,
and a Sunday, and to-day is the 3d. any
person unfamiliar with the dates and
dropping in on the carnival of commingled

I Btruck the national natal day.
The air yesterday was stirred by con
stant detonations, and last night the
patriots, too impatient t.> await the com
ing of the Fourth, sent up their fire
works and shouted themselves hoarse.
To-day and to-night there will be more
of it, and then to-morrow there will be
a real glorious Fourth.

Hundreds upon hundreds of people, pa

BOLD WORK OF
BURGLARS AT
THE PRESIDIO
Capt. Wilder's Quar
ters Entered.
A ROLL OF BILLS STOLEN
FIVE CHECKS ALSO TAKEN ARE
FOUND IN THE KITCHEN.
The Police Were Notified of the Af
fair and Detectives Are En
gaged in Making a Thor
ough Investigation.
A burglary In the officers' quarters at
the Presidio is such a rare thing that
when It became known yesterday it
caused the greatest consternation and
surprise at the daring displayed by the
burglars.
The victim Is Captain W. E. Wilder of
the Fourth Cavalry, and he reported the
affair at police headquarters yesterday.
He Bald he retired about 11:30 o'clock
Saturday night, leaving a roll of bills
amounting to $230 and live checks for $150
on the mantel in his sitting room. About
6:30 o'clock yesterday morning he was |
disagreeably surprised when he arose to ;
find thaf the roll of bills and the checks!
had disappeared from the mantel. He :
made a careful search of the room, but j
could find no trace of them, but pursu- I
ing his investigations he found the live j
checks on the kitchen floor. The burglars
had discarded them, preferring to take
only the currency.
"All the doors and windows In my quar
ters." said the captain, "were unlocked as
usual, as no one suspected for a moment
that any one would dare to commit a
burglary in such a place as the Presidio,
but we were mistaken."
captain Bohen detailed Protective T.
B. Gibson on the case, and he went to the
Presidio and made a close investigation of
th.- premises. He was unable to get a
dew to the burglars, but it Is confi
dently expected that they will yet be
discovered.
There is a strong suspicion that the
burglars were familiar with the interior
nf the captain's quarters, and knew
that he had the money and where it was
k>'pt. They were also aware of th<> fact
that the windows and doors were un
locked. If the burglars are connected
with the army it was a simple thing t'Â»
enter the house without attracting BUSpli -
ion, but if done from the "outside" it was
a most daring piece of work and none but
experts ;it the business would have at
tempted it.
WRAPPED IN MYSTERY.
A Daring Thief Takes His Life
in His Hands.
Tho circumstances surrounding the rob
bery are enveloped In the deepest mys
tery. Neither the officers nor the detec
tives have a.n3 - clew as to the Identity of
the daring thief. Be the man who hÂ«
may. he lacked neither nerve nor a per
fect knowledge of the house. He en
tered in the dead of night a room In
which were asleep two officers. Th>^
room was in perfect darkness, for the
blinds were drawn. There was ni carpet
upon the floor. The officers were sleep
ing upon cots and near at hand each had
laid his loaded revolver. This was not
all, for .the thief passed from the room
occupied by Captain Wilder and Lieu
tenant Frederick T. Arnold, through a
vacant room adjoining, into the room
occupied by Lieutenant George O. Cress,
rifled the pocketbook of the officer, and
then retraced his stops through the
vacant room, out into the kitchen, where
he stopped to leave the checks and Cap
tain Wikk-r's watch before departing.
Granting that the man was in his
stocking feet, there were a number of
articles about the rooms over which, un
less he were familiar with the place, he
might have stumbled in the dark. This
only adds to the mystery, for the officers
are light sleepers, and are not accus
tomed to lights after they retire, there
fore it is highly probable that if the
thief had one it would have awakened
These are not all of the mysterious cir
cumstances, considering the fact that
Captain Wilder says that he knows of no
one whom he can suspect. The captain
arrived at the Presidio on Friday. He
with the two lieutenants were assigned to
Quarters in one of the Queen Anne cot
tages just to the east of the Alameda, The
cottage faces upon the main roadway. On
the left and front is a high cedar hedge.
On the right are the quarters of Captain
6'Hara. while, in the rear the premises
slope down into the maze, from which
they are separated by a row of eucalyp
tus trees. Whoever committed the theft
took advantage of his knowledge of the
grounds surrounding the cottage, and be
sides must of a necessity have been inti
mately acquainted with the interior of the
house. The thief must also have known
that Captain Wilder had the money upon
his person, and by some means this per
son must have known exactly where th-*
officer placed the money when he retired.
Captain Wilder makes the following suc
cinct statement regarding the robbery:
"I retired shortly after 11 o'clock. In
the same room with me was Lieutenant
Arnold, while Lieutenant Cress was in an
adjoining room. When I retired I placed
$2'{'J in bills upon the right end of the man
tle. On top of them I put my revolver
and watch. I had about $600 In checks,
which were in the middle of the mantle,
and upon the left end was $5 in small
change. The bills were the troop fund,
which I had not deposited. I had been
very busy since arriving and had not
time to attend to depositing it. The doors
of the house were not locked, for it la
an unusual custom at a military post.
Lieutenant Cress had his pocketboock
upon a chair beside his cot. He only lost
a few dollars, while Lieutenant Arnold es
caped, for he placed his money and watch
under his pilliow. When I awoke in the
morning and looked for the money it was
gone. A soar-rh of the premises revealed
the fact that the thief had left the checks
and the watch in the kitchen. This
showed that he did not want to take any
thing by which he could be traced. The
small change upon the left end of the
mantle was also untouched.
"Whoever robbed me knew I had the
money, and what is more they knew i
where I placed it when 1 retired. There
is only one way in which I can ac
count for the." robbery. The thief
was hidden in the hedge and saw ,
us when we came into the house. Tbea
he crept up on the porch and by peeping
through the blinds saw me when I put the
money upon the mantel. When we arose
In the morning none of the doors were
opened nor were any of the windows up.
From the finding of the checks and my
watch in the kitchen I believe that the j
thief left the cottage by the rear door.
Once out of the house it was easy for
him to escape by the maze."
It is most probable that the thief en
tered by the front door. There is a fact
that tends to prove this. Just inside the
front door is a small hall with a door
opening from the left into the room where
the captain was sleeping. When the t 'fl
eers retired this door was closed, as far
as thej- can remember, whil^ the one lead
ing into the vacant room that separated
their mom from that Of Lieutenant Cross
was opened. In the morning the door
leading into the hallway was opened,
while the one leading into the vacant
room was closed. If he entered at the
front of the house the thief necessarily
must have passed entirely through the
house. To do this he must have be<;n
familiar with it. for he must have known
that none of the doors were looked. Fur
ther, he must have seen Captain Wilder
place the money upon the mantel, for it is I
not at all probable that he used a light.
Again, he took only the bills, not running
any risk of making a noise by gathering I
up the silver.
Detective Gibson declares that the rob
bery was committed by the sleekest of
professionals, and if this be the case, then
the thief must have had an Intimate
knowledge of Captain Wilder's affairs.
The mystery hinges upon the fact as to
who was the person that possessed all the
necessary information required to commit
the robbery. From the diagram will be
seen the probable entrance and exit of the
thief, and also the ciangpr that he ran of
awakening the sleeping officers. One fact
is certain, and that is that the thief knew
positively that Captain Wilder had the
money upon his person when he entered
the house for the nipht. The officer knew I
of no one who had any knowledge of his
having this money upon his person, as he
had made no display of It. Lieutenant
Cress was fortunate in losing only a small
amount, but the fact that the thief on
tered his room and went over to his cot.
which was in a far corner, only goo? to |
prove that the man has plenty of nerve.
Columbia Marksmen.
The regular meeting: of the Columbia
Pistol and Rifle Club was held yesterday
at the Harbor View range. The at
tendance was larger than usual and near
ly a dozen ladles accompanied the shoot
ers to witness the sport. Several par-
I ticipated, and for beginners their first
efforts were satisfactory. From early In
the morning until late in the day the
markers and scorers on the one rifle and
two pistol ranges were kept busy. The
new targeting system introduced by F.
O. Young worked satisfactorily and was
well appreciated, because it permits of
shooting so much faster than by the older
systems. The best scores of the day were

Heyer lias a Change of Heart and Wiil Vote Against

Committee- -Another Victory.
THB cowardice of Supervisor Al- !
Heyer will avail him nothing,
and fortunately will not injure
the city. The projected franchise

way ' will not b< a< e,>n, â

Six members of the board axe

tion and his vote will divide the board
â  !>'â 
â  ns declares that he has been op
the Grant avenue loop and
will vote against it it" it con
on before the entire board
[ n this connection a most
curious confusion has arisen. The
members of the Street Committee claim
that they do not know whether or not
they have recommended the obnoxious
iiises for adoption. It is not by
any means a certainty, therefore, 1 h it
the Street Committee will urge the
franchises to-day for adoption.
As a matter of fact the members of
the Street Committee did not vote in
dividually on Thursday to recommend j
the four franchises for adoption. After 1
thf* several advocates of the measures
had finished talking the chairman of !
declared that he pre- !
sumed there was no objection to the â 
franchises that were asked for by the
railroad company. No member of the
committee made an objection and the
clerk arrived at a perfectly legiti
mate conclusion that the committee
favored the franehis- s.
â¢ rvisor Collins, who is a mem
ber of the Street Committee, says that
ht- was absent from the room at this
critical moment and when he returned
h'' was informed that nothing of im
portance had been done. This asser
tion of Collins, coupled with his antag- j
onism to the four franchises, places a j
very different light upon the matter.
Supervisor Kalben, who is also a mem
ber of the Street Committee and was
absent at the meeting on Thursday, in
likewise opposed to the franchise steal.
Supervisor Attridge, another member
of the Street Committee, will not say
that he is in favor of the thefr.
Under these circumstances it is very j
unlikely that the committee will r
Its conclusions which were so strangely
adopted. If a recommendation is ma<Je
It will, a^ aln-ady indicat -d. be defeat
ed, as Supervisors Perrault, Lackmann,
Byfcngton, Deasy, Kalben and Collir?a
jvill oast their votes against it.
In speaking about the matter yester
day Supervisor Collins was emphatic in
his opposition i" the proposed fran
chises. If the people want the fran
chise they can wait, he believes, until
the operation of the new charter. Su
pervisor Collins was seen ;ji Mill V.i!- '
ley ;!7ni spoke as follows:
"Last -Thursday, when the matter "f
franchises came up before the board,
I was out in the ante-room. < m my re

against it: I don't think It is the
proper 'thing. That Is not the fran
chise- that was originally railed the
â¢corkscrew,' and I don't see why we
should stick that in there. 1 tun op
posed to it for the present. If the
charter is going into effect let the city
g-et the benefit of these franchises."
This settles the matter definitely.
The gigantic steal has been prevented
and the city will retain the valuable
privileges <>f its streets for legitimate
competition, li is fortunate that to
day is Che last day upon which the
great theft might have been accom
d. the time limit has been
reached. The business men nnd prop
erty owners of the northern and south
ern parts of the town will . receive the
road for which they have persistently
agitated and the raid of the monopoly
has been rendered fruitless.
Supervisor Heyer has come to the
conclusion that he has had time enough
in which to investigate thoroughly the
whole franchise problem. He does not
want to learn anything more about the
affair. n-Â« he is now convinced that the
franchises should not be granted. Ac-
cordingly he pays lie will vote against
them t<>-day. He wan seen last nicht
and declared that ho had. reached a de
cision against the proposed franchise.
If he keeps his word his vote will be
tli" seventh, one more than is neces
sary to defeat the iniquitous measure.

Mrs. Sanchez Killed in
a Saloon.
A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY
EDUARIKD MUSCAT SPED THE
FATAL BULLET.
Made a Feeble Attempt to Kill Him
self While His Victim Was
Writhing in Her Last
Agony.
Mrs. Sofia Sebastlana Sanrhez. aged 22
years, was shot and killed yesterday
morning in Blanken's saloon at the cor
ner of Broadway nnd Kearny street by
â  Eduardo Muscat, with whom she had
i been consorting?. A buUet from his re
volver entered her mouth as she was in
the act "f screaming for help. It plowed
its way upward through the hones of her
skull, making Its exit on the top of her
head She died a few minutes later at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital. After shoot
ing the woman, Muscat turned the re
volver against himself, but, probably
through cowardice, nis aim was so bad
that he missed his head and shot twice
through his hat. He is at the City Prison.
charged with murder.
Muscat's fear that the woman was on
tha point Of deserting him seems to have
been the motive for the crime, although
he said after the shooting that the fatal
quarrel arose from the fact that Mrs.
Sanchez, having been informed by him
that he was k Â»h,k to leave her. had re
fused to return jewelry she had taken
fr Muscat"iÃ a Russian, 34 years old. and
first met Mrs. Sanchez last January at
Vallejo At that time he was a fireman ;

Muscat says, he came to this city to get
rid of the woman, although telegrams!
found in her trunk tell a different story.
At any rate, i he couple took a room at the
New Montreal House. 1300% Stockton!

reled so incessantly and Muscat a
the woman to such an extent that the pro
prietor gave them notice last ihut>d.i\
that they would have to move. âââ_, '
.\t 9 Â'cluck yest.-rday morning Muscat ,
and Mrs. Sancliez entered Blankens place j
and called for drinks, which were served
by the proprietor, who immediately wen..
about his business, paying no particular
: attention to them. Occasionally he heard
loud words, but could not make out their
import. Finally about 11 o'clock Muscat
borrowed 25 cents from him. and after
another drink went out with Mrs. San
chez. In a short time the woman re
turned, being followed almost Immediate
ly by Muscat.
"Keep that man away from me." ex
claimed Mrs. Sanchez to Blanken. point
ing to Muscat. "Keep him away."
Muscat brushed by her and went into
the bar through the swinging door.
Blanken went In to advise Muscat to
leave Mrs. Sanchez alone and to give her
the opportunity he thought she desired
of Slipping away. Instead of doing so,
however, the woman followed the grocer
Inside and stood in front of the bar as if
to resume an interrupted conversation.
Blanken left the quarreling couple to
go into the front of the store, but had |
not been there more than a. minute when I
he heard a shot. Rushing through the
door, he saw Muscat tire the second time,
the muzzle of his revolver being within
a few inches of the woman's mouth.
As Mrs. Sanchez fell on the floor. Mus
cat directed the revolver against his own
head and pulled the. trigger, emitting a
yell as it exploded and falling to the
Hour. Blanken, although an old man. I
jumped on the murderer and grabbed the I
weapon. Still yelling, Muscat pulled the
trigger twice, before; the revolver was
taken from him by the storekeeper.
By this time Officers Haggett and Fowle
had arrived. They placed Muscat, who
was supposed to be mortally injured, un
der arrest and sent for the patrol wagon.
Dr. J. H. O'Connor was summoned from
the County Jail, and, hoping to save the
woman's life, had her sent to the Harbor i
Receiving Hospital, where she died before
they could get her on the operating I
table. Her body was taken to the Morgue.
By this time it had been ascertained
that Muscat was not wounded at all.
He was taken to the City Prison and
booked for murder. Dr. Rice of the Re
ceiving Hospital made an examination of
him and found that he had four scratches
on his face and it few slight powder
burns. A hole in the rim of his hat and
two in the crown showed where his mis
directed bullets had sped.
The prisoner was taken later before
Captain of Detectives Bohen, where he
â¢was warned that anything he might say
would be used against him. He answered
that he was ready to tel! all he knew. He j
said he was born in Odessa, Russia,
thirty-four years ago. and after knocking
around the world considerably had gone
into the navy as fireman and made one
trip on the Nero to Manila. On. his re- j
turn to this country he received his dis
charge. He said he met Mrs. Sanchez
last January at Vailejo, but tiring of her
he left her and- came alone to this city,
where she followed him. Resolving, how
ever, to get rid of the woman he re
enlisted in the navy and was to go away
on the Albatross. ;He told this to Mrs.
Sanchez, he said, and it made her
furious.
A few days ago, Muscat continued, the
woman had stolen from him a silver
watch, a chain and a gold pin and $42
in money, which she refused to return
to him. While she was with him in
Blanken' saloon, she scratched his face |
in her rage, and threw a glass at him; |
also offering to go down the street and
purchase a knife with which he could kill
her. Muscat .remembered having the re
volver in his pocket, but professed to
know nothing of the shooting.
Mrs. Sanchez was a very good looking
young woman, and is said to have come
of a good family in Mazatlan, Mexico.
Her maiden name "was Valdez. Her hus
band, Antonio Sanchez, and a 6-year-old
son are in Mexico.

DODGE CAUSES HAVOC
AMONG THE MERCHANTS
The Personal Property Assessments
Enormously Increased.
Assessor Advances City and County Values Millions of
Dollars â Some of the Tax Evaders That
Were Caught in the Raid.
DR. WASHINGTON DODGE, the
Assessor of San Francisco, has
completed the assessment roll of
the city and county and is ready
to submit for inspection a docu
ment that will startle' the community.
The Assessor has increased enormously
the personal property assessments of
merchants, business men and capital
ists. In some instances the assessment
for this year is thousands of times
greater than it was for the last fiscal
year. The figures in detail will as
tound the people of the city, for a
casual inspection will demonstrate that
hundreds of merchants have heretofore
es-aped their just obligation to the cits
and have shifted to the shoulders of
others the burdens that belonged to
them.
It is out of the question to compare
the assessments of last year and this
; year fn detail, hut over eighty typical
examples have been chosen and they
illustrate with absolute certainty not
only that an equitable division of com
munity burdens has been made this
year, but that behind the assessment
of last year a great public scandal
lurked. It should not be forgotten that
in the comparisons that will follow
I reference is mad' 1 only to personal
property assessment.
Assessments on real property are not
discussed, as the Assessor is not yet in
a position to give thorn and they pos
sess no particular significance. Th>
enormous increases have been made in
personal property. In real property
the changes made by the Assessor are
few and unimportant.
In comparing eighty-seven personal
property assessments of last year with
the assessments "f this year on the
same property a startling condition ><f
facts is revealed. The total assessment
for the personal property of those
eighty-seven persons, corporations and
firms" was $3,515,056 last year. The ;ts
s^ssnient for the same firms, persons
and corporations for this year was
58.415.210. It may readily be seen,
therefore, that fraud or negligence
marked the first assessment.
No attempt will be made to deny this
accusing fact, as nearly all of the per
sons, firms and corporations have al
ready paid their taxes upon the as
sessed valuation of their personal prop
erly as fixed by Assessor Dodge. These
eighty-seven firms will pay taxes on
an assessed valuation which is $2,903,
--lf>4 greater this year, or nearly double
what it was last year.
The result of this enormous increase
is at once apparent. The total as
sessed valuation <^f city and county
property is enormously increased. As
it increases the rate of taxation de
creases and Dodge estimates that the
rate of $1,073 adopted by the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisor?
will be reduced at. least 5 cents on the
dollar, making the lowest taxation in
many years.
Nor is this all. In the matter of
bonds of a quasi-public character and
of corporations the Assessor expects to
add assessable values aggregating $20,
--000,000 to his roll. The Attorney Gen
eral is expected at any moment to ren
der a decision telling whether or not
these bonds may be taxed. This mat
ter has rested in doubt for fifteen years
and a decision is now anxiously
awaited. It was promised last Friday
and is again promised for to-day. It
is perhaps interesting to note that the
Assessor has already collected $500,000
!In personal property taxes, which is
$100,000 more than his predecessor col
lected for the entrre preceding year.
Some of the Individual increases de
serve more than passing comment.
The tax evaders have had a very bad
case of consternation. Mose Gunst. for
example, has been raised from $11,240
to $26 500. '"â¢ P- Huntington. that
shirker of all legitimate obligations,

CHURCH OF ST. JOHN
WELCOMES ITS PASTOR
Rev. G. G. Eldridge Chosen to Fill
an Important Mis
sion.
Yesterday afternoon services were held
in St. John's Presbyterian Church, corner
of Octavia and California streets, the oc
casion being the installation of Rev. G. G.
KMridÃ*\ St. John's new pastor. Rev.
James NVoodworth performed the offices
of mod. rater, the sermon was preached
by Rev. H. N. Bevier. the charge
to the pastor was gl\en by Rev. H S.
Wheeler and thp charge to the people by
Rev. R. W. Reynolds.
The services brought out a large at
tendance, as the church has been without
a pastor for the past two years, and all
the parishioners wire eager to welcome
Dr. Klurtdge. whose fame has preceded
him to the city.
Dr E'.dridge. although a young man,
has already made his mark In the ecclas
tical world. Graduating with high hon
ors from the San Anselmu Presbyterian
Seminary some four or live years ago. he
was cailed to the pastorate of Vacavuie.
There he rapidly acquired such a reputa
tion for eloquence and general f ability
that the congregation of St. Jopn s iook-
Ins around i"r some one to take charge
of the church, came to the conclusion that
none could so well fill the important posi
tion as the young minister who was yes-
e Gre.at things are looked for from Dr.
Fldridee who has entered upon his pas
torate under the happiest of auspices.
DR. THORNE'S ACCIDENT.
Nearly Loses a Leg as a Result of
Jumping On a Car.
For the fact that, in time, he will be
able to walk .around again on two good,
sound legs, young Dr. Walter Thome
must give thanks to good blood, a sound
constitution and the skillful ministrations
of his brother physician. Dr.. Frank
Thompson. Luck had nothing to do with
Dr. Thome's sorry plight is due to the
fact that on the 3d of last month he tried
to board a Jones street car while it was in
motion, and failed. In falling he scraped
his ahin bone in the vicinity of the knee.
At the time nothing was thought of the
matter, as it was considered only a pain
ful bruise, which in time would heal oÂ£ it-

ment increased from $16,320 to $40,000
and probably thinks he is getting off
easily. Sanford Sachs hasn't recovered
from the shock yet. His assessment
was raised from the ridiculous figure
of $100 to $25,000. James L. Flood will
pay upon a basis of $29,500 instead of
$5000. The Southern Pacific Company
will try to justify its evil existence by
paying on a basis of $153,100, instead of
$46,750. Herrin must be out of town.
The American Bank and Trust Com
pany escaped last year with an assess
ment of $37,414. This year it will pay
on a basis of $159,702.
Among the more important of the
others are the following: Carrau &
Green, from $1800 to $30,000; Baldwin
Jewelry Company, from $7000 to $70,000;
M. J. Brandenstein, from $3380 to
$110,000: â¢'. M. Plum & Co., from $5215
to $40,000; Meyerstein & Co., from
$19,050 to $50,000; S. Bachman, fronÂ»

UNITED ACTION AGAINST IT
FATHER CARAHER SFEAKS FOR
HIS PARISH.
All Religions and Creeds Will Come
Together to Put an End to
the Open Illicit
Traffic.
Despite the protests of n justly indig
nant and wrathful public, the Nymphia,
a lodgment for degraded .-women, is an
established fact. All efforts to re
move these outcasts from the thickly
populated portion of the town have so far
been a complete failure as the present
traffic proves. Rut thn inhabitants of the
north end of the town will soon act and
employ every legal measure to remove
this new blot upon their section of the
city. The feeling of opposition to this
ground-Moor hotel on Pacific and Stock
i ton streets is augmenting hour by hour.
It will nut be long before some drastic
measures are adopted to put an end to
the institution, and the people are now
waiting' for the call to bring them to
gether in general mass meeting.
During the construction of the build-
I ing Father Caraher of St. Francis Parish
' fought the builders and owners at every
move. He was partially successful in his
; endeavors to prevent the incursion of
these femmea dv pave into his district.
On Saturday night last the alley was
' opened to visitors and remains so at the
i present time.
There has been a general disposition
â  among the clergy of every denomination
in that part of the city to unite and fight
the matter to a conclusion. In this conneo
i tion Father Caraher said last night:
I did not know that this place was
opened, as I have been very busily en
gaged in spiritual affairs. If it is so, that
Is the signal for a systematic and gen
eral opposition to its continuance. We will
meet In a general assembly in the ver â¢
near future â representatives of all
churches and creeds. This thing must not
be endured, and the people of this district
will not suffer It.
Of course, there are some people who
favor It. but they are not the morally <?ood
people. The great majority will fight it
bitterly. The fact that this so-called
Nymphla is now in nightly operation forces
us to do all in our power to remedy the
evil, which can only be done by compet
ing the denizens to remove from their
houses of shame and pollution. In this
1 voice ihe spirit of the people living
within the bounds of my parish. [t may
take a few days before we collect our
forces, hut when we do there will be a
concert of action. This so-called Nymphia
breeds degradation, vice, sin and the rot
ting of the soul.
