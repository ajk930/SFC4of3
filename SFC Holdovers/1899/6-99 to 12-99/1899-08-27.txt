COUNTERMARCH AT INTERSECTION OF MARKET AND KEARNY.
T- such a hot time in ;
the old town last night that it !
smoked. A glorious zz.dlzz was f
made long after midnight of the
three days' reception to the j
volunteers of California return- i

ed from the Philippines, and the people j
who hai made it returned to their
homes, hoarse from cheering, their vis
ion blurred by the glare of red fire and
electric lights, their legs aching from
hoars of standing, but none the less {
happy that the boys were home for j
-
keeps and that they had had such an
opportunity of testifying their joy.
For three days, at every step in the
progress cf the welcome to the heroes.

The grand night parade in honor of
the First Regiment and the heavy ar
tillery was scheduled to move not later
than 3 o'clock. Everybody knew every-
body- else wanted, to see -". â __*_ knew
also that advantageous positions were
few. and, far between. In consequence,
the crowds began to gather early. At
6 - o'clock . in the evening there was a
continuous, If thin. line of people ex-
tended along the Market curbs .from
Van Ness avenue to the ferry depot. At
half past 6 a person found it difficult
to make his way through the crowds on
the sidewalks. At ' o'clock nearly
everybody was out and nearly every-
body knows _how.it was.
It .was dark. Tou could tell -". by the

. That was on Market street. , Out Â»
Van Ness avenue, where the big parade
was about to form, there was a lack of
official electric illumination, but no.lack
of people, of strings of ."taming lanterns,
cr fireworks or noise-making inven
tions. The sidewalks of ; the avenue
were jammed, the picket â¢â  fences, the
steps to residences, the broad flights of
stone stairs leading to church and -ca-
thedral and -the windows of every
home. Out as far as Broadway, where
the different divisions were forming. to
make up the parade, there was a great
scene of bustle, the gail ; . r. _ cf mar
shal** and the shoutings â -: aids. There
was confusion out of which it seemed
hopeless to ' form anything, much less
; an orderly parade of the immense pro
, portions contemplated. - 'Â
I At 8 o'clock the different sections
were in pretty good shape for the start
.on Van Ness avenue but downtown the
â  Sood cf humanity had absorbed so
â  many tributaries that more than one
I vert tired the guess that no parade
could hope to make the slightest head-
way on Market street. That thorough
â fare was a pert" jam from one cad to
> the other. As far as the eye could see â
and that was a pretty- long distance,
-thanks to the official illumination â
there was a closely packed mass of hu
: manity from house-line to house-line.
;On the sidewalks people had given over
the Idea of walking and stc-od stock still
;to await the parade. There was not the
; slightest chance for any person on the
â¢ pavement to crowd over the -curb out

Hancy to the thoroughfare. At the
lower end the ferry depot was an
architectural iridescence; up on Twin
Peaks dag tar barrels and red fire
gave a fair imitation of the boiler
room of an inferno. From every block
iB the whole length of that great line
-great spouts of flame shooting in air
told that the fireworks committee was

The merrymakers beneath the lights

There was no point on any building

you would see women and men with ba
bies at breast and on'sSoulder, with

and coattails: and it speaks volumes
for the infants of San Prancisco that
none of them exhibited fear at the
great gathering or the Unwonted lights.
It speaks other volumes, too, for the
crowds of San Francisco that parents
dare venture their darlings in their
midst. After hist night's experience.it
would seem that they can do it with
Impunity. No case was reported where
any little one had come off the worse
for a most delirious experience.
And there is no doubt that it was
delirious. Everybody was going every
which way. Nobody knew and very
few seemed to care. The only idea that
seemed to possess all minds alike was
to get the best possible position to view
the parade and shout for the warlike
sons of California. Men and women at
a loss for a seat In -a stand or a win-
dow did the next best thing and se-
cured standing room in some wagon or
hired a hack or buggy and were driven
around on the side streets until such
time as they believed the procession
'was duo to pass, when they took , up
their positions as near Market street
as they could get. *.'.
Stcpladders were borrowed by others
from accommodating friends in stores
and office buildings and planted on
other side streets as near the line of
march as might be. Men and women
with camp stools and chairs and boxes
chased around frantically, pushed and
elbowed â maybe some of them swore
cuss wordsâ in the effort to get within
spying distance.
It was all movement, except for the
parade, which did not seem as if it
would ever come, and light and smoke
from the red fire and noise from the
shouting voices, the horns and bells
and bombs and cannon. v
And so it got to be half-past 8 o'clock
before the signal rockets from the
stand at Van Ness avenue and Market
street announced to the watchers in the
stand of the finance committee at
Lotta's fountain that the great proces
sion was in motion. It was, but the
motion was slow by reason of the great
crowds that blocked its passage on the
avenue, forced back unwillingly on the
crowd on Market street that contained
the promise of blocking it altogether.
It became apparent to those in charge
of the parade that something had to
be done to clear the way for the march
ing men. The police, for the time be-
ing, had thrown up their hands.
It was thought that cavalry might do
better and a troop was sent out on
Market street to see what it could d**.
It did fairly well considering. The
crowds gave way as it approached and
closed in as it passed, leaving condi
tions exactly as they were and the
troopers none the wiser.
FIRST REGIMENT ARTILLERY
HOW THE CALIFORNIA BOYS ARE LOCATED.
C-.J-3HE most frequent question asked by visitors to the camp is in regard to the location of some com-
pany or battalion, and it is not often easy to find . a man except one . belonging to the organization
sought who can tell much about it. ;â¢ In view of this, the accompanying diagram will prove of interest and
'â *â¢* information. "' * .'.'-;â '!â¢"â *"-/
;..*.' The camp is considered from the standpoint of the line of tents occupied by the commanding officers and
their staffs. The battalions each occupy one street, two companies below and two above the kitchens and mess
rooms, each company occupying eight circular tents. ' In the case of the .artillery battalion, the batteries being
.much larger than the infantry companies, there Is one below and one above the mess rooms. The groups of
.three tents at the end of each battalion street are occupied by the battalion commanders and their adjutants,
with one tint for a battalion headquarters. The four square tents at the; end' of each line of circular tents
are occupied by the company officers. " â 'â¢'..' -

MYRIADS OF SCINTILLATING LIGHTS TURN
Still the -head , of the procession
crawled on snail-like on the avenue,
many bars behind the lively marches
played by the League of the Cross band
that headed it. And slowly the thou-
sands in the other twenty-one divisions
followed, so slowly that it took nearly
three quarters of an hour before the
. detail of mounted police in advance
turned on to Market street.
..As soon as they faced the solid mass
on that thoroughfare it became plain
to their practiced eyes that something
heroic had to be done if the parade
was to' pass any given point at any
given time. Chief Lees solved the
problem. He sent orders post haste
to the Central -and Southern police sta
tions and to the police stables and or
dered out all the patrol wagons and
all the drivers available. He ordered
them to meet the head of the procession
at McAllister arid Market streets, fall
in ahead, eight abreast, and force the
crowd out of the way.
At the given place, at the time or-
dered, the eight wagons wheeled in |
ahead of the mounted police, their j
right headlights gleaming. Eight driv- â¢
ers "gee upped" to sixteen nags and :
the crowd gave in, unwillingly at first,
' but it gave in and the' procession
moved, still slowly, down the line, to be
cheered and to wave flags in return, to ,
be illuminated with red fire and to
cheer itself.
It was almost 10 o'clock when the I
head of the procession reached Kearny i
street, and it was an hour later that,
j having countermarched up Market, to
Montgomery, to California to Kearny, |
it met the parade still passing down .
Market street. -
It was all as beautiful as it could be. j
Every organization in line looked its
best and stepped its best Major Gen
eral Shafter and a couple of his staff
in a carriage rode ahead of a detach
ment of the Third Artillery in its full
dress. The Native Sons' section was
the largest' turnout of that* organiza
tion in many a long day, each parlor
vying with the other in point of num

bers and appointments: the Foresters,
the Woodmen, the Red Men in the garb
of aborigines, the Irish section, the
German Vereins, the Austrian guards,
all had fine representation in line.
The division of white-trousered pu
pils of the public schools under com
mand of Marshal George Miehling
made a fine showing, although the
young drummers attached thumped
the sheepskins so Industriously that
they made the marchers hump to keep
up with them. The Jackies of the bat
tleship lowa were loudly cheered. The
journeymen butchers in their white
aprons made up a big division, and so
did the Exempts and the volunteer
firemen and the Fraternal Eagles and
the commercial travelers and their float
of trunks. The ladies and gentlemen
of the Toung Men's and the Young
Ladies' Institutes were in the line in
number. -Ââ¢;â¢*. '.;.-;â 
By the time the two ends of the pa
rade were passing each other on Market
street the police by the greatest display
of energy had succeeded in getting the
crowd far enough back to allow of
good marching 'time, but, despite this.
SOME INCIDENTS OF THE BIG DAY.
it seemed a long time before the Cali
fornia volunteers came in sight. For
two hours the parade had passed, and
still they came not. At last they were
due, the veterans of the Spanish-Amer
ican war and the wounded of the First
California had passed in carriages and
had been cheered 4 until the welkin
rang, and all necks were stretched up
; street for the First and the Heavy Ar
| tillery. They didn't seem to come, al-
though all else in the parade appeared
to have passed.
A wait of twelve minutes and people
began to think that, by reason of the
fact that the banquet at the ferry de-
pot had' been timed for 10:30 and that it
was then midnight, the Fighting First
and the artillerists had been marched
down some other street to the ferry
and would not parade.
It was no sooner thought than it was
believed. Still no sign of them and the
crowds broke up and again filled the
street, many leaving in sheer disgust.
"It's a shame!" said one man.
Another was about to acquiesce,
when a loud shouting was heard up the
street. ;'**'â¢"%
"Here they come!" was the cry, the
lines re-formed, red fire was lighted
again, all was joy and cheers. The
volunteers, for whom a whole city had
turned out, were not going to disap
point their friends. It had net been
their fault that the hiatus had occurred
in tiie line. The crowds above had
simply overwhelmed and held posses
sion of them from the crowds below.
They were marching as fast as they
Could. â¢
The ovations the returned volunteers
received along the line were as numer
ous as were once the cobbles on Market
street. It would be simply impossible
to describe them, so what's the use
trying? They were cheered at every
step of the road and they cheered back
at every other time. The whole town
went mad and the volunteers piled into
their, second banquet at the ferry depot
long enough after midnight to call it
another breakfast.
MIXED WITH
THE PEOPLE
A platoon of mounted police, a pla
toon of United States Cavalry, the
grand marshal and his aids and a band
passed, and then the United States
troops opened the real parade. They
were led by .'a band of the Third Ar
tillery from Angel Island. Then came
Captain Sedgwick Pratt in command of
the artillery battalion, which consisted
of Battery E, under Lieutenant Haynes
from Fort Mason. Battery O from the
Presidio, under Captain Bennett, and
Light Battery C, under Captain Califf.
Right behind the artillery came the de
tachment from the lowa, led by the
marine band. There was a company of
marines, under Captain Carmany and
First Lieutenant Rittenhouse, and a
company of bluejackets, under Lieuten
ant Twining and Naval Cadets Babcock
and Bowers. The whole was under the
command of Lieutenant Witzel, who
had upon his staff Naval Cadet Hanra
han, adjutant, and Passed Assistant
Surgeon Crandali. â *â -.-,' â -.-â -;
The division made a fine showing, and
all along the line of march it was greet
ed with cheers and the waving of flags.
The men from the lowa were particu
larly well received, and they marched
in a way to merit all the applause they
were given. / w;: " .
Down through the line after the divi
sion of regular soldiers and sailors had
passed, there were scattered here and
there bodies of men under arms. There
was the Veteran Reserves of Califor
nia, the Austrian Guard, in their
feathered hats and gray uni
forms, the * . well-known Independ
ent Rifles, the Knights of the
Red Branch, the German shooting
societies and the Veteran Guard. j Be
sides these there were the Dewey
Guard, a squad of boys in white sailor
suits, who had formed a guard to wel
come Dewey home. They were not
named for a place in the line, but
they came up to the Alameda division
of Native Sons, and the Native Sons
allowed them to 'follow on be
hind. Then came the school chil
dren, led by the band of the
(Horace Mann Evening School, a band
of boys, but one that played with the
lustiest; the Columbia Park Boys' Club.
under Captain C. R. Alberger; the
Boys' Brigade, and a good-looking body
of fifty or more naval apprentices from
the British vessels in the harbor.
Ahead of the apprentices was borne an
English flag, the first that has appear
ed in a military parade here in years.
At places along the line it was cheered.
Every one was waiting for the boys
in brown, so while the organizations ,
that preceded them received all kinds
of welcomes, the real cheers were kept
for those who were to come. They
were long in coming, for far up the
street the crowds began, to close in, and
the progress they made was slow and
uncertain.
The enthusiasm started over the
veterans of the Spanish war, the vete
rans who were not attached to any par-
ticular command and those who went
out from the State naval militia to
serve in the navy. The veterans were
headed by Charles Dutreaux, a naval
militiaman, who left the State organiz
ation to become a seaman on the Olym-
pia. He was with her during the bat-
tle of Manila. Just behind marched
some of the -men who were in the tug
fleet here, and then came the veteran
soldiers. It did not take the crowd long
to find out who was passing, and the
people gave cheers enough to wake
themselves up and make ready for
what was coming.
What was coming were mostly police
waving whips, aids with bedraggled
sashes and hoarse voices, patrol wag-
ons with bells clanging and cavalrymen
and Signal Corps men beating back the
advancing crowds with the flat of their
sabers. What the crowd didn't know
about the parade would fill a respect-
able column, but they did know that
last .of all would come the California
men, and that just before would come
the other veterans. As a consequence,
when it. neared the end, there was no
controlling the people. They rushed
out from the sidewalk, and the column
dwindled from company front to col-
umn of fours and then to column of
twos and even to single file. It was be-
cause of no desire on the part of the
people to break up the parade. They
didn't want any one else to get in ahead
of them, so every one rushed for a posi
tion in front, and there was no room
left for the troops.
Along Van Ness avenue it was hard
marching, but when the column of vol
unteers neared Market street it was a
day's work to go a block. When half-
past 10 arrived, when the boys, were ex-
pected to have passed down to the
ferry, back again and over Montgom
ery and Kearny streets, and then on
out Market again,* to be reviewed at
City Hall avenue, it was still trying.
with the aid of half the police force, to
make headway down the first block on
Market street. â â â . , â ;' â¢"..*. *./-â .- -,-.;..*'â¢.'
And even the upper end of Market
street was not so bad as down below
Eighth,-, where .the strings of lamps end-
cd. â ; Below that it was every man for
himself and dodge the flying clubs if
he happened to be out of uniform. It
was a howling, struggling, sweltering
mass of humanity, packed closely as
hay in a bale and with the best of
good nature, trying to jockey each
other out of places on the curb or next
the tight-stretched ropes. The air was
full of cheers, and exploding powder,
and rockets and red fire, with its ac-
companying sulphurous smoke. Roman
candles were let off into the crowd,
with not a murmur from those who
caught the sparks; rockets showered
ribbons of flre in among the people, and
heads ducked now and then to dodge a
bomb wavering in its flight. But no
; one cared and no one complained; they
only crushed closer, guyed the police-
man nearest and waited for a chance
to make another inch toward where the
men were passing.
The California men marched ' as best
they could, but there was that about
their line which perhaps escaped the
ones who yelled the loudest or howled
the longest.. To many the straggling
line of old men who marched' by the
side of the boys were enthusiasts who
had dropped into the column to follow-
along, but to those who knew it was
one of the prettiest elements of the pa-
rade. They were the â  veterans of the
Civil Warâ the members of the local
posts of the Grand Army, and it was
their line that was thrown around the
new veterans, coming home with new
stories, ' new glory, new' honors. The
grizzled old men could ; hardly stand
the strain' of the hurried march, the
harrying of the crowd,' the smoke, the
noise, the excitement, but they' strug
gled on until first one and then another
of the boys would give them a hand,
and so, arm in arm, the new and the
old. they walked down between the
dense masses of people, no longer a
' line, no longer the semblance of a col
umn, only a thin stream of men in
brown, helping along a few men in blue.
Together they took the cheers and to
gether they answered them, and bound
together by the tie which service un
der the flag weaves, between all men.
they divided the honor, and the boys
felt no loss from their share.
It was supposed that the line would
countermarch on Market street, and
that is what it tried to do, but the
crowd fixed it otherwise, and the coun- j
ter march was not all a success. It was
good enough until the volunteers came
along, and then it was good enough for
the* people on the near side, but those
across the way were not going to be
balked of a chance to see their own
regiment. When the military division
passed the volunteers again somewhere
near the reviewing stand there was not
much trouble, for the glitter of uni-
forms, the measured tread of regulars '*
and the rumbling of guns is sight
enough for any ordinary mortal, and j
the people kept their distance, but i
there is nothing forbidding in a column j
of native sons, particularly "" an open
one, with the men armed with flags, so
when" the Native Sons came along first
one more daring than the rest would
cut across; then another venturesome
one would follow, and when the watch-
ful police officer would give chase some
daring man would - make -bold to rush
through the citizen line dragging his
wife after ' him, or perhaps two or
three children. No self-respecting
crowd is going to stand that kind of
thing for any length of time, so before
the California men had come well in
sight the countermarch had developed
into a crossfire, with the unfortunate
countermarchers doing no better serv-
ice .than serving as squads around
which the crossing people could dodge
from the police. - /,'..'.
Two or three mounted officers rode
ahead, and in its wisdom the crowd
would give way and let them pass. The
same courtesy was accorded the patrol
wagons and troops of cavalry that had
left the line of countermarch and were
coming down the street again. But
when these powers of peace and war
had passed the crowd came in again,
/md so it went on down the street, a
wave along the front of the people,
keeping pace with the width of the wa
gons and then closing in to within
handshake of the boys.
When the column reached Third
street there was nothing but a narrow-
ribbon of blue and brown, for the ar
tillery men wore their blue uniforms.
and in the general mixup had mingled
with the .end of the regiment.
A carriage carrying two wounded
men made its way along faster than
the line, and hanging behind it, run-
ning when the carriage had a chance
to hurry, and pushing when it slowed
up, was Major Rice, commander of the
artillery, and his adjutant. Lieutenant
Koster. It was not dignified, but then
dignity had been left up the street, and
the major and his adjutant were mak-
ing fairly good time, and were corre
spondingly happy. . !'
- this way the rfren. reached the
ferry for the half past 10 o'clock ban-
quet. They were a little late, but they
didn't begrudge the time. It was after
12 o'clock, but if they could have seen
the way the people turned contentedly
for home, and hear what they said as
they fought for seats upon the cars,
perhaps the boys would not think they
had been kept waiting too long. They
have waited, but the city has waited,
and last night the people had their
turn. _

who are members of the local circles of
tho Women of Woodcraft.
Will J. Beatty, marshal, led the di-
vision assigned to th*- Knights of Pythias.
This had in the lead a company of the
uniform rank of the order. These were
followed by a company of plumed knights
and a large number of the members of the
local lodges. One feature of this division
was-a delegation of the D. O. K. K. in the
strange dress each member wears in per-
forming the service of initiation.

riage contained many members of the
order. .- :.-
The Young Men's institute councils of
this city and a number from the interior
were under the marshalship of J. J.

American flag,", while the officers wore
their regalia. QB__B-->
The San Francisco Aerie No. 5 of the
new organization known as the Fraternal
Eagles turned out a fair proportion of its
membership. The members were on pa
rade in the regalia of the order. Its main
feature was its float, which represented
a large rock guarded by eagles, one at
each corner, while on the apex of the rock
was an eagle with outstretched wings and
on the rock sat Columbia, represented by
Miss Gertrude Hayes, crowning an army
and a naval hero.
The Knights of the Maccabees were not
behind the other orders in making a good
and attractive display. A large banner at
the head indicated who they were. The
ladies of San Francisco Hive. Golden
West Hive and Phebe Hearst Hive were in
this section In decorated and illuminated
carriages. This order was preceded by
the Commercial Travelers, who turned out
in goodly numbers, with a truck loaded
down with sample-cases.
The Ancient Order of Foresters made a
very creditable- showing, the several

These were followed by the grand offi

from the interior. The float which
this order has was an attractive one. Mrs.
Miiler, the left guide of the Supreme Cir
cle of the Companions, represented Lib-
berty. Miss May Walter represented
Charity and two ladies attired as Red
Cross nurses represented Benevolence,
; these being three of the characteristics of

The Ancient Order of Hibernians made a
strong numerical showing, and at the

members of the Ladies' Auxiliary.
The Foresters of America made a very

most creditable showing. The executive
council of the order, including the grand
chief ranger. Judge Hughes of Sacra-

SOLDIER BOYS
BANQUETED
In the grand nave of the ferry building
last night the gallant volunteers of the
First California Regiment and the two
batteries, B and D, of the California
Heavy Artillery, were banqueted by the
people of San Francisco. The feast was
a fitting climax to the brilliant and ex
citing demonstrations in honor of the re
turning heroes which have come thick
and fast for the last four -days and
marked the close of the season of festiv
ity and joy such as was never before seen
on the Pacific Coast.
Sixteen hundred veterans sat at the long
tables, arranged in parallel rows almost
the entire length of the great corridor.

of the grand stairway, the tables were ar
ranged in a hollow square, and around
these were seated the officers of the regi
ment, the invited guests to the number of
forty and the citizens' executive commit-

It was half an hour after midnight when
the blare of trumpets in the street below
announced to the waiting throng of spec
tators on the ferry building that the sol
diers were coming at last. Tney marched in
With bugles blowing and drums beating and
took their seats at thÂ« tables, which were
loaded down with edibles and lavishlj"
decorated with flowers. The officers came i
next, and as soon as they had taken the
places assigned them the current was
turned on and the thousand red. white
and blue electric bulbs that lined the
arched roof in rows flashed into brilliant
light; which caused an involuntary cheer
to arise from the soldiers, which was re
peated with redoubled energy when they :
saw at either end of the nave welcoming
words blazing down at them through red ,
lamps charged with electricity.
Then a band of twenty-five pieces !
perched on a stand at the lower end of the
grand nave struck up "America" and the I
cheering was ..rain renewed. The boys i
cheered everything and everybody, nclud- j
ing the city, the State, the "Citizens'
Executive Committee, the ladles of the
Red Cross, the army and the navy. And
then they fell to and tackled the chicken
and turkey that had grown cold waiting
for them to come. It was well on toward

and for that reason the speeches were I
somewhat curtailed.
Mayor Phelan made the opening ad- .
dress, warmly welcoming the volunteers

language on their fine, untarnished rec
ords as soldiers. Colonel Duboce made a

wbrda that told volumes.
It was well on toward daylight when

strains of "Home. Sweet Home." floated j
through the building the gathering broke
up and the end of the official programme

proud, had been reached. San Francisco

her admiring citizens. " ;
ALL NATIONS
REPRESENTED
The foreign-American societies distin- ;
guished themselves last night ln the
grand parade. The first of the societies
was in the eighth division, the Austrian
military company, preceded by the well )
trained Austrian military band. In the j
thirteenth division, the section given over !
to the Irish societies, two full companies
turned out in tte full regalia of their
orders. The Ancient Order of Hibernians
came first, the clergy following in car
riages The Celtic division, comprising
the Knights of St. Patrick, Knights of
Tara St. Patrick's Alliance of California
and other Irish societies, stretched out
their column several full blocks in length.
The sixteenth division was given over ,
to the German organizations and evoked
considerable enthusiasm as It passed
clown the line of march. Marshal Franz
Jacoby at the head of the column, was
mounted on a heavy black charger and
was in the immediate advance of the
Krieger Verein. The green uniform and
black cockades worn by the thoroughly
drilled Germans were a feature of the
parade. Following them came the Turn- ,

era in gray uniform, perfectly drilled and
sustaining a ffne alignment. The Slavic,
Italian and Servian societies were in the
eighteenth and nineteenth divisions, and
when the crowd broke in on the forma
tion they were routed.
m
STORY OF THE
MADDENED MOB
The crowd that Jostled and joshed and
jammed each other era Market street last \
night was without exception the most tre
mendous throng that ever assembled in
San Francisco on any one occasion. We
have had our great jubilee celebration and
Fourth of July celebrations by the score,
but if the crowd that came out to witness
all of these events were put together it
would not equal in density the one that
congested Market street last night to pay >
a fitting tribute to California's returned '
heroes. i
Up to 9:30 o'clock it looked as if there
would be no parade. The sidewalks were
packed clear to the walls of the buildings,
and the centers of the wire cables strung
tautly along the edges of the sidewalk ]
were stretched quite a distance into the
street.
Market street was a moving panorama
Market street was a moving panorama
of frantic people literally wild with
ecstatic delight and pent up enthusiasm.
They marches along in the center of the
car tracks waving Hags, blowing fish !
horns, tooting whistles, yelping through
paper megaphones and jangling cowbells.
The usual demonstration on New Year's
eve was shaded and shamed. They made
more noise in one minute on Market street
last night from one end of it to the other
than the New Year's eve crowd would
make ir. the entire evening.
Clear down to the ferry the human
throng moved, crowding and Jostling and
fighting every inch of their way.
The police stationed along the line were
powerless. They handled the people
rather roughly, but few used their clubs
and perhaps if the police had not re
sorted to rough, methods the parade
might still be lined up out on Van Ness
avenue.
Just before the moving column reached
the corners of Third. Kearny and Market
streets that section was so crammed with
people that it was almost impossible to
move a step. !
The bursting of bombs and the menacing
"woo. woo, woo" of the jostling mob and
the clanging of the bells on the patrol
wagons which fought through the crowd
ar.d made way for the procession brought
fear to the nervous, and even strong men
paled visibly as they struggled along with
the moving crowd.
In an open patrol wagon stood Chief
Lees, waving his hands excitedly and
shouting at the top of his voice to his men
along the line. The Chiefs living brigade.
which consisted of eight patrol wagons,
a large squad of policemen and mounted
officers, bore down upon the crowd slowly
and it melted like ice in a hot sun before
the formidable minions of the law. Down
Market street Hew the crowd and few
stopped till they reached the ferry. The
nearer the end of the thoroughfare the
greater grew the jamming mass. They
could not escape through the lines on
either sice of the street, for the patrol
wagons drove close to the curb. When
the crowd reached the ferry it poured into
East street, north and south, like dense
volumes of smoke. Following the Chief's
(lying brigade came a detachment of cav
alry, and It, too, assisted in keeping the
thoroughfare clear for the head of the
procession.
Down at the ferry Captain Wittman.
who rode in front of the patrol wagons in
a buggy, swung the column right, and the
patrol wagons followed him in excellent
order. They fell in four abreast, and the
procession following after swerved to the
right to allow the countt-rmarchers to
pass.
All -long the line Chief Lees was
cheered to the echo for his strategic move.
They shouted from the tops of buildings
through megaphones that the "Chief was
all right." and the Chief acknowledged
the compliment by doffing his cap.
Just as the parade was turning at East
and Market streets a fire on the warter
front tapped in. and the Fire Depart
was forced to battle its way through the
mob. Luckily nobody was injured, but
nany were badly frightened. On the way
jp to Montgomery street the excitement
3n the left side of Market street was in
tense. Thousands of people had pushed
through the sidewalk cables and crushed
â  - - â 
Into the center of the street to view the
passing column moving toward the ferry.
They did not figure on Chi I Lees return
ing with his brigade of heavy patrol
wagons and husky policemen, and when
it moved on them there was some lively
scattering to get to places of safety.
It was a case of the crowd handling the
crowd, for rather than be crushed and
trampled under the wheels of the patrol
wagons they crowded back toward the
sidewalks and left the way clear for the
parade. All along Montgomery street and
down Kearny street to Market the pro
cession was not hampered by the crowd.
Un these thoroughfares the police held
the people well in subjection and the
lines on both Bid. - of the street were even
and orderly, and there were no obstruc
tions in th- center of the street.
There was more trouble In store for
Lhe Chief and his flying brigade when the
procession again reached Market street.
rhe crowd had blocked the street again
and the procession moving toward the
terry doubled the throng.
The brigade got ln action again and the
way was slowly cleared. All the way
>ut Market street as far a.*- Van Ness ave
iue the police had to fight their way. At
Sixth and Market streets the flying brig
ide encountered the thickest mob. It
ook fully a half hour to clear the way as
'ar as Eighth street. In these two blocks
nany people were trampled on by the
worses attached to the patrol wagons and
he cavalry. In front of a cafe at the cor
-r of Sixth and Market streets the re
peating crowd dashed against a step-

ladder on which were seated several men
and women. All were thrown forcibly to
the ground, and one man who occupied a
position on the top rung of the ladder was
thrown so heavily to the stone pavement
below that he was rendered unconscious.
The head of the counter-marching pro
cession met the California troops on the
tail end at the corner of Hayes street and
Van Ness avenue. There the crowd once
again broke loose and the progress of the
gallant heroes was completely checked.
Father McKinnon's horse grew fractious
and for a time it looked as if the chaplain
would be thrown off. He proved himself
an excellent horseman, however, and soon
had his steed under control.
At this point Chief Lees' brigade and
the cavalry left the head of the proces
sion and swung in front of the gallant

their long march to the ferry.
And it was well that he did. for all
along the line the people had again
crowded Into the center of the street.
As the California boys neared the ferry
the crowd grew less dense. It was grow-
Ing late and the people had grown tired
and weary of standing on the streets for
so many hours, so they were allowed to
march along without having to fight their
way up to the banquet which awaited
them at the end.
"I was gone .till I thought of these pa
trol wagons," admitted Chief Lees last
night. "The town was simply too small
to hold the people and my men were
powerless. I was forced to resort to these
harsh measures or there would have been
no parade." >.\* d
Captain John Spillane of the southern
division accompanied Chief Lees in the
charge on the crowd and on several oc
casions when the mob seemed Impregna
ble Captain Spillane got cut of the wagon
and did a patrolman's duty.
All in all it is safe to predict that San
Francisco will never be aDle to bring out
such a crowd as it did last night. For
once in the history of the city San Fran
cisco took leave of its senses.
HERALDING THE
COMING PAGEANT
It was not long after the scheduled hour
when a star bomb went hurtling toward
the heavens from the corner of Market
and Van Ness and heralded the approach
of the pageant. Another and another fol-
lowed; and from the tower across the
street the white shaft of a searchlight
swung along the line of the approaching
column. A mighty cheer went up from
the throats of the vast army spread la
black masses along the street, the re-
straining ropes were forced outward and
the crowd, mad with excitement, started
to surge into the street. The police, how-
ever, were ready and the threats of
swinging clubs and trampling hoofs drove
the people back from the line of
march. There they remained awhile.
but as the column swung into
Market street and started on its
journey to the ferry a horse, bearing
an aid. fell heavily to the pavement.
Fearful that the rider had been seriously
Injured the crowd again broke the ropes
and rushed to his rescue. Again the clubs
were brought into play, the crowd driven
back. The aid, uninjured, assisted his
horse to rise and away went the pageant
on its mission. When the Ked Men round-
ed the oorner it was a signal for general
hilarity. The members of Althamos Tribe,
costumed and painted for the warpath,
watched the crowd for familiar faces.
One seen he was dragged from his po
sition in the line of spectators, a war
dance was hopped on his toes and he was
led captive in the line of march. Pro-
testations were useless, pleas for release
unheard, and then the paleface knew the
power of tribes of the forest. Below Lar-
kin street the crowd again jammed
toward the center of the street and tor
some time the police were powerless.
Finally six patrol wagons abreast cleared
the streets and the march proceeded. It
was thus all along to the end. the police
and crowd in constant combat, but the
former always prevailed and those who
but stopped to think knew that they had
seen a few over five hundred men. clothed
with authority, handle a few under five
hundred thousand people and then no
brutality was used. The police had some
difficulty handling the many wagons built
up to represent so many small theaters.
with seats for sale reserved or otherwise.
These wagons would be halted at the
curb, the springs bumping together under
the Lois, a brief dialogue would' ensue
between officer and driver and then the
wagon would depart, quicker than it
VIEW FROM
LOTTA FOUNTAIN
The executive committee's grand stand
at Lotta's fountain afforded a command
ing view of the pageant. It was at thi3
locality that the crowd was . the densest
and the enthusiasm most manifest. In
the stand as the committee's guest of
honor was Mrs. A. S. Townsend, "the
soldiers' friend." She viewed the parade
for hours, cheering every division, waving
her handkerchief gleefully and smiling
her approval on every feature. Lieu
tenant Commander Hughes and Surgeon
Means of the battleship Boston were also
guests of the executive committee.
The scene from the stand was one of
exceptional animation. The crowds grew
steadily from early in the evening, and
toward 9 o'clock it appeared that the
population of all San Francisco and that
of the surrounding cities of the bay had
assembled on tne streets within the ra
dius of a block of Lotta's fountain. First
the sidewalks filled to the curbs and those
who desired to pass along were forced to
take to the middle of the streets. Poiice-
men stood helpless in the midst of the
moving mass of humanity. It was useless
to attempt to force the crowds back
there was no room for more on the side
walks, and all the officers attempted was
to keep the throng ln motion. The police
were a weary, anxious-looking lot of men.
When a patrol wagon drove along ac
companied by Chief Lees and a force of
men prepared to stretch wire ropes to re
strain the crowd there was a sigh of re
lief. That crowd was the one thing that
worried those who arranged the celebra
tion. For a time the wire rope plan was
effective, but by twos and threes tne peo
ple broke through the lines, and long be
fore the lights on the patrol wagons, that
marked the approach of the parade, ap
peared creeping at snail's pace along
down Market street, the tnoroughfore
was black with people from curb to curb.
No one who viewed that throng from the
stand had hopes of witnessing a parade
that night. It seemed almost beyond hu
man possibility to force a passage through
that human barricade.
At the outset the crowd kept on the go.
People hurried and scurried, without
knowing why or whither. But this
did not last long. As the crowd grew
in numbers it quieted down, and remained
a. stationary mass. When the approach
of the patrol wagons was announced
along the line, those in the rear fell out
and most of the crowd that could not be
accommodated on the sidewalks melted
away into the side streets and alleys. 1 It
Sid not prove a hard crowd to handle and
only once or twice during the night were
! the police forced to use their clubs to em-
phasize their orders to "get back."
The first incident of the evening was
the passing of General Seamans and an
â  acquaintance. They were In a carriage
bound for Van Ness avenue to fall in
! line. No cheers marked their way. In
: fact the chill was so noticeable that the
1 crowd in the streets began to shout "Ice,
ice."
An inoffensive Chinaman was roughly
handled by a crowd of toughs as he at
; tempted to get out of the jam and make
! his way up Kearny street. They grabbed
his queue and tried to sever it from his
1 head. They would have succeeded but
i for the interference of an old gentleman.
The police appeared disinclined to enter
too vigorous protest against the outrage
for fear of exciting the crowd and losing
control.
With an eve to business a man with a
wagon loaded several stories high with
discarded fruit boxes took up a position
opposite the grand stand on Market street,
and in a few minutes disposed of the en-
tire load at 2." cents apiece. One of the
purchasers was a man leading a couple
of little boys. When he bought his box
I he tried to force his way to a place of
vantage to locate it. and in his haste and
excitement forgot all about the two boys,
and lost them. He found them by their
yells, but when he want back after his
box it was gone.
In all directions from the stand was cvi
; dence that men will perch in perilous
i places to view a parade. Over Newman's
} saloon a man found a footing on a cornice
scarcely three inches wide, and there,
; high above the sidewalk, watched the
parade from start to finish. He had a
bottle of whisky to keep the chill out of
his bones, and took liberal doses as every
, division passed by.
When the crowd was the thickest a dele
, gation of university boys came up Market
j street ln single file. doing the
i lock step. They managed to wriggle
: their way through the throngs, appear
\ ing like a huge snake crawling from one
j side of the street to the other, hut when
they reached the junction of Third and
: Market streets they came to grief. The
crowd rushed at them, broke their line
I and they were soon scattered. They
stood in the middle of the street and
shouted themselves hoarse with the col
i lege yell.
A piece of burning decoration fell from
- the Examiner building, striking a woman
;on the head. She fainted, but did not fall.
The crowd pressed around her so closely
that she was held ud until she was
forced out on Third street, when she
. fell to the pavement. A little water re-
vived her and she went back Into the
thickest of the crowd. She was deter-
mined to see th" California boys If she
lost her life In the attempt.
A jolly tar from The lowa amused the
crowd before the parade passed by dane-
ing a Bailor's hornpipe on the Kearny
: street pavement. Several sailors joined
him. and for a time the street was turned
Into a dance hall.
Once or twice when the police attempted
to force back the crowd that tried to
crush Into Market street from Kearny
they had their clubs taken away from
them. They got rather rough several
times, and the people would not have It.
Some of the officers lost their heads, and
whenever they did they lost their clubs In
the bargain.
The oldest veteran in the line rode in a
carriage. When he passed the commit-
tee's stand his enthusiasm got the better
of him. He stood up in the hack and
shouted like a Comanche Indian, while the
crowd veiled its annroval.
GRAND SIGHT
IN THE SKIES
From the top of the Parrott building,
above the smoke of burning powder and
the dampness of the ground fog which
late in the evening settled upon the city,
the scene was one never to be forgotten
and difficult to be described. Far below I
the crowds surged and shouted, not the !
shout of rioting and disorder, but a good- i
natured, noisy expression of rejoicing, to
which horns and whistles lent their aid.
But the attractive feature was the il
lumination over the street, the lines of
incandescent lamps stretching away until
they looked like one broad pathway of
gold ending at the lighted tower over the
bay. To the southwest the dome of tne
City Hall bedecked in light cast rays of
gold over the surrounding darkness. To
the north loomed up the towers of the
Native Sons' building and Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art, also shedding light in all
directions.
Suddenly from the dome of the Claus
Spreckels* buiklln-g. illuminated in every
window from the street to the very top,
a white puff of smoke flew, followed Dy
a sharp resounding report of a cannon.
At the same time the reflected glare of
Roman fire away off by the bay at the
end of Van Ness avenue was seen.
The two announced that the procession
had started. At other points along the line
of march the match was applied to the
pans of powder, which cast a ruddy glow
upward and around. Within ten minutes
scarcely a point of the compass could be
found where the red lights were not burn-
ing, while away off on the top of Park
Hill toward the Twin Peaks bonfires were
lighted, adding to the general brilliant ef
fect* *"â Â£' __ ~' ,
Then came the fireworks. Rockets car-
rying every hue of the rainbow shot into
the air and scattered their brilliant - con-
tents, while from down on the streets
1
arose the shouts of "Oh!" and "Ah!" of
admiration. Around the dome of the City
Hall and the Claus Spreckels building
there were halos of varicolored lights
from the incessant discharge of volca
noes, bombs and rockets. In* fact, all along
the line of march, which was easily made
out from the top of the Parrott structure.
could be seen the same brilliant display
of fiery life. The air was alive with it,
and the booming of cannon and bombs
gave voice to that life. Some of the
grandeur of the scene above the ground
mist was lost to those on the streets, but
to those on the high housetops the scene
may' be described in two wordsâ grand,
magnificent. â >.* ..---â -
COMPLAINT FROM
DISCHARGED MEN
The following petition, signed by 221 dis
charged soldiers who returned on the
Sherman, has been forwarded to the Sec
retary of War. It speaks for itself. These
discharged men have all seen service and
are returned with the best of characters.
They have the moral support of every

ON" BOARD U. S. A. TRANSPORT SHERMAN.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Aug. 24, 1_39.
To the Honorable Secretary of War, Wash
ington, D. Câ Sir: We. the undersigned citi
zens of the United States of America, lately
discharged from the regular and volunteer
armies of the United States, desire to make
the following- statement, complaint and re
quest:
We have each and every one of us been dis
charged ln the Philippine Islands and upon dis
charge were refused travel pay from Manila.
P. L. to San Francisco. Cal.. being furnished
in lieu thereof transportation and subsistence
ln kind, being subsequently assigned to the
U. S. A. transport Shern.an.
Those of us who cashed our final statements
in Manila made written and verbal protests
against receiving the money therefor minus
the travel pay. The least that we expected
was that we would receive good quarters
aboard the transport and rations of good qual
ity and sufficient fur our needs.
Instead of that, . we have at no time received
rations sufficient in quantity to satisfy our
hunger, and on many occasions the food has
been absolutely unfit to eat.
In addition to that, our quarters are (or
rather were, the worst on the boat, being on
the lowest deck, below water line. We have
at all times been Subjected to military author
ity, which ordinarily we would not have ob
jected to. had it been in our power to do so,
but which has on this occasion been very ob
jectionable, and which has made our position
on board this -.hip very humiliating. We all
of us know that we are not receiving the class
of transportation or the quantity and quality
of rations that the United States Government
Intended for us.
We. therefore, respectfully request that we
be allowed our travel pay ln full from the
Philippine Islands to San Francisco, Cal., a.s
we believe that after suffering from the hard
ships and privations *bf the protracted cam
paign in the Philippines that we are more en
titled to the same than are our comrades who
serve In th_ United States and who receive
their travel pay in all instances. We also re
spectfully request that the condition of affairs
aboard this ship be Investigated and those re
sponsible for the condition of the rations
brought to Justice.
Hoping that this will receive the immediate
attention of the War Department, we subscribe
ourselves. Very respectfully.

DR. COULSON'S
KINDNESS
Dr. Nat T. Coulson threw open his hand
some rooms in the Murphy building to
his friends and patrons, and they obtained
a splendid view of the parade from the
windows. There were accommodations for
several hundred guests, and nearly that
number availed themselves of the oppor
tunity and watched the brilliant spectacle
in comfort. Three colored waiters from
the Palace Hotel, attired in dress suits,
flitted among the guests with refresh
ments, while a string band of six pieces
furnished excellent music. â *â¢***. *
In honor of the occasion Dr. Coulson
decorated his spacious rooms with flags.
Pretty souvenirs were also given to the
visitors. They consisted of flags, wooden
cards from the Philippines and colored
horns. The courtesies extended by the
popular dentist were greatly appreciated
by those who enjoyed his generous hospi
tality.

ENTERTAINMENT
NOT YET ENDED
The entertainment for the returned Cali
fornia boys did not end with the banquet
last night. The citizens" executive com
mittee decided yesterday to arrange a
theater party for them for next Wednes
day night. Every showhouse in the city
will be called upon to provide accommo
dations for a portion of the regiment. It
was decided that the committee would
purchase none but rows of front seats for
the soldiers. The details of the party
will be arranged early in the week. Ne.xt
Friday evening a similar entertainment
will be arranged for the crew of the Bos
ton.
MANY FOUND NO
PLACE TO SLEEP
Every doorway, or alleyway, or place !

; ing place for some visitor to the city who
j had come here without calculating upon

, there has not been a vacant room In the
city. During the night, after the parade
i had passed, men, women and children
I could be seen slumbering on boxes, some
i huddled close to buildings, others in door
ways and a few on the curbs. The vesti

I could find no other place in the city to

FOR SOLDIERS
Morgan F. McCollough. Westport, Ind.;
Joseph Whitney, Dallas, Tex., and Luther
Hudson, Hollingsburg, Pa., all members
of the Twenty-third Infantry, were given
employment yesterday by William Weh
ner of Evergreen, Santa Clara County.
The men had been discharged from the
service some time ago. Being unable to
secure employment they had spent all
their money and for some days had been
around the headquarters tent pleading for
assistance. That their cases were deserv
ing the Red Cross ladies were thoroughly
satisfied, and when Mr. Wehner made his
offer they were the first to be recommend
ed. He stated that he had been attracted
by the appeals of the employment com
mittee and felt that it was his duty to
help in the work of providing for the men
who had gone to the front to fight for
their country. In addition to employing
the men mentioned he offered to provide
accommodations at his ranch for a couple
of convalescents.

IN HONOR OF
BOSTON S CREW
In the heat of the excitement over the
home-coming of California's soldier sons
the citizens of the city will not overlook
the officers, marines and sailors of the
Boston. The executive committee agreed
yesterday that they deserved a taste of
California's hospitality and generosity
and Immediately undertook plans to cele
brate their arrival. Next Wednesday
night the electrical illumination of Mar
ket street, the City Hall and the ferry
building will be repeated in their honor,
the company making the display agreeing
to allow their wires and lamps to remain
in place for the occasion. Other enter
tainment will be provided for the men who
fought with Dewey at Manila Bay. Ar
rangements will be perfected as soon as
the work incident to last night's great
parade is disposed of.
SETTLING DOWN
TO CAMP LIFE
Ten o'clock was the time set for the
California men to report back to camp
yesterday morning, and at that hour they
commenced to come in. The two com
mands were a little late in reporting all
present, but every cne reported within an
hour and nothing was said. ;p-,*'
The principal object in having the men
all present was to care for their baggage
and be on hand when the customs officers
inspected it. All through the morning the
trucks were arriving, and in the open
space at the end of the tents of the col
onel and the regimental staff the effects
of the regiment were piled high. The
artillerymen's baggage was put over be
hind Major Rice's tent- at the end of the
artillery battalion street. The baggage
was inspected and passed right there, and
then each man took his effects to his tent.
There waa not much done during the
day except to entertain the visitors who
went out to the Presidio. There were
thousands of them and they were all talk-
ative, so the camp was a lively place.
As soon as a man had 'attended to his
baggage he was not called on for any
further duty, but was ordered to report
back at 6 o'clock, so the men might have
time to form for the parade. It was un-
derstood that after the parade and ban-
quet the men would be allowed to seek
their - own homes, so they were notified
they would turn out without arms or
equipments.
The furlough after the parade and ban-
quet will be until 10 o'clock this morning.
The men will all report then and will put
the camp in order before noon. Colonel
Duboce and Major Rice expect that a
great many people will visit the camps
this afternoon, and they wish to have the
place looking well.
It has not been decided what will be al-
lowed in the way of liberty to-day and
this .evening, but it is certain that to-
morrow morning the business of muster
ing out will be commenced. The muster
ing officers notified the commanding offi
cers yesterday that they would do noth
ing until to-morrow. General Shatters
orders were that until the reception was
well over the men should be given full
liberty.
While the men are awaiting the muster
out they will have but little to do besides
getting fat. There will be no drills, and
an occasional dress parade is all that will
be expected from them. By act of Con
gress their rations will be materially in-
Among the expressions of welcome
and gratitude to our returning volun
teers the distribution of some good
wholesome stimulant to the sick and
wounded and enfeebled has been de
cided upon. This thoughtful act of hos
pitality is being performed under the
auspices of the Board of Health, and
It is said that the honor of supplying
the material has fallen upon the pro

LONDON, Aug. 27.â A dispatch from
Johannesburg says word has been re
ceived there from Pretoria that Presi
dent Kruger and General Joubert favor
sending a special peace commission to
England composed of members of the
Volksraad, headed by E. W. Reitz,
State Secretary.
Though no actual developments have
apparently taken place in the Trans
vaal situation, as previously reviewed
in these dispatches, public interest in
th*> crisis has been wonderfully quick
ened. This is due to the dawning real
ization that Great Britain is making
the most methodical preparations for
war. The utter lack of official news
and the serious outlook have made the
week one of tension. Contradictory re
ports from home and abroad have flour
ished, and on the strength of these the
newspapers have Bee-sawed from peace
to war and vice versa, hopelessly at
sea. Endless supposition has been in
lulged in regarding President Kruger's
counter propositions, but from a broad
point of view such details are not im
portant, as compared with the fact that
President Kruger has refusedâ -some
say evaded the "irreducible minimum"
of Sir Alfred Milner, the Governor of
Cape Colony and British High Commis
sioner of South Africa.
It is now nearly a week since the
British Government has been in pos
session of President Kruger's reply.
Whether, in the Interests of peace,
powers higher than Mr. Chamberlain,
the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
are still temporizing, or whether or not
a decisive ultimatum is already on the
way to the President of the Transvaal,
is pure conjecture. The most conserva
tive opinion is that the Boers will ulti

mately back down, but there are no
signs, Judging from the military activ
ity at the British war office and the
same activity in the South African Re-
public, that such is likely to be the
case, though both sides may be using
the movements of troops as a bluff.
That Mr. Chamberlain is not in a pa-
cific mood, is evidenced by the publica
tion subsequent to the reception of
Kruger's reply, of the correspondence
between the Boers and Sir Alfred Mil-
ner. According to the Speaker this ac-
tion has immeasurably increased the
difficulty of keeping the peace. Com-
menting upon this fact, the Speaker
says:
"Unfortunately, neither in Downing
street nor at Pretoria is the value of
moderation and good temper sufficient-
ly appreciated. The consequence is
that every day the situation becomes
more dangerous and may yet see the
two races locked in a sanguinary
struggle, simply because the leading
men on both sides have failed to keep
sufficient command over their own
tempers and those of their immediate
supporters."
All that can be said is that in a very
short period, probably less than a week,
the world will know definitely whether
President Kruger finally acknowledges
British suzerainty and its potentiality,
or whether he really intends to resort
to arms in order to defend his conten
tion. It is palpable that the British will
now refuse to accept any evasion of
their suzerainty claims whatever other
concessions President Kruger mightl
make.

Manchester Guardian, a well-known
writer on economics, says that he finds
widespread willingness among the Jo-
hannesberg Outlanders to take the

Changes in Railway World.
[ MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 26.â 1t Is an- j
in my power. As you know, for three
months we have been going. President
Kruger has made, perhaps, some little
progress, but I cannot truly say that
the crisis is past.
"President Kruger procrastinates in
his reply. He dribbles each reply like
water from a squeezed sponge. His of- j
fers are accompanied with conditions i
which he knows to be impossible, or he
refuses to allow us to make a satisfac-
tory investigation of their nature.
"I do not think it will be denied that
we have exhibited unparalleled pa-
tience in the relations between a para-
mount and a subordinate state. The
situation is too fraught with danger;
it is too strained for indefinite proposi
tion. The knot must be loosened, to
use Mr. Balfour's words, or else we
shall have to find other ways of unty-
ing it.
"If we are forced to do that, then I
would repeat now- words used by Lord
Salisbury in the House of Lords. I say
that, if forced to make further prepara
tion, if this delay continues much long-
er, we -anall not hold ourselves limited
by what we have already offered, but
having taken this matter in hand, we
will not let. go until we have secured
conditions which, once for all, will es
tablish us as the paramount power in
South Africa and secure for us our ob-
jects there, equal rights and privileges
promised by President ' Kruger when
the Transvaal's -* independence was
granted.- :
"If it comes to this, if the rupture
which We have done everything in our
power to avoid Is forced upon us, I am
confldent we shall have the support
not only of the vast majority of Britons
but of the whole empire. In all
this bad business there is one thing
upon which we can congratulate our
selves, and that is the unity of the em
pire. No British subject can suffer in
justice anywhere without awakening a
responsive chord In our most distant
colonies, which stand together in main
taining the honor and integrity of the
empire."
j nounced that James N. Hill, vice presi
' dent of the Eastern Minnesota, Is to be
| come general manager of the Great
Northern, a position newly created.
Lewis M. Hill, who has been assistant
to his father, will succeed his brother,
with headquarters at Duluth.

ROUND-UP OF
NEGRO BANDS
IN GEORGIA
! Murderer Delagell Surren
ders to the Troop of Sa
vannah Soldiers.
SITUATION IMPROVES
Nevertheless Additional Regiments
Have Been Ordered Out and the
Danger Is Not Yet Over.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call
DARIEN, Ga., Aug. 26.â round-
up of riotous negroes in Mcintosh
County by the military to-day result-
ed in the surrender of Henry Delagell,
the murderer of Deputy Sheriff Towns-
end, and the location for future arrest
of Delagell's brother and the woman ;
i directly Implicated in the killing. Dela-
gell's surrender was made to Lieuten-
ant Wood, in charge of a detachment
of thirty Savannah soldiers stationed
fifteen miles in the country to back up
! the Sheriff's posse, who were scouring
the swamps.
Delagell to-night stated that he sur-
rendered to the troops for protection, as
he saw the Sheriff's posse was closing
in on him and his capture was only a
matter of a few hours or minutes. The
arrest of Delagell and the arrival of
reinforcements for the military seem to
have broken the backbone of the defi
ance of the law by the negroes. A
whole regiment of troops is now on
' duty in and about Darien, under com-
mand of Colonel Lawton, but it is not
! believed there will be further blood
j shed. There are still several ringlead
i ers of the blacks wanted by the officers
lof the law. Unless they come in and
; surrender or are brought in by their
friends and turned over to the authori-
ties, the troops will go after them to-
morrow.
The courthouse here has been turned
Into a barracks for the soldiers. Many
of them to-night are completely ex-
hausted, having been on duty for three
I days and two nights.
At noon to-day a courier from the
swamp, eighteen miles out, arrived and
reported that the negroes had congre-
gated in and around the house of the
Delagells", six miles from the swamp,
and would not surrender or permit the
Delagells to be taken. The Sheriff,
with a posse of 100 men, went to the
Delagells' house, but returned without
making an attack. He gave out the in-
formation that he would need more
men to enforce a demand for the much
wanted negroes, and set about enlarg-
ing his posse. Colonel Lawton, after
communicating with Governor Candler,
ordered the Liberty Independent Troop
of Light Cavalry here and they left
Jones station almost immediately, and
came through the county over the
I wagon roads, a distance of twenty-five
miles, arriving about 4 o'clock this
afternoon.
â  Colonel Lawton also ordered the
First Regiment of Georgia Volunteers,
at Savannah, to proceed at once to
Darien. They reached here this after-
noon at 6 o'clock. Colonel Lawton has
ordered tents and camp equipments for
the men in case they are needed.
It had been reported here that 1000
negroes were in the vicinity of Dela-
gell's house, having come from all parts
of Liberty and Mcintosh counties. Re-
connolterlng was done by courier, but
as the negroes were scattered for sev
eral miles through the swamp their
number was not definitely ascertained.
Colonel Lawton, late in the afternoon,
ordered the Fourth Regiment, with
camps at Brunswick. Yaldosta, Way-
cross and other towns in this section,
to be prepared to move at a moment's
notice. The soldiers at Brunswick and
Waycross are in their armories await-
ing orders to proceed to Darien. The
white people were aroused for miles
around and came in during the day in

JOSEPH HAYES
SUDDENLY DROPS
OUT OF SIGHT
Evades His Nurse and
Disappears.
Joseph Hayes, a well-known liquor deal
er, who lives at 20 John street, is among
the missing, and his family and friends
are greatly perturbed. He disappeared on
Sunday last, and since then no trace has
been found of him. "When last seen he was
staying at Paraiso Springs, where he had
gone on the 16th inst, to recuperate, j
Searching parties have scoured the hills ;
in the vicinity of the resort, and a re- :
ward has been offered in the hope of find- i
ing him, but up to the present without
success.
Mr. Hayes had been drinking heavily,
and was prevailed on by friends to go to
the springs and recover his natural con
dition. He took their advice, and in com- j
pany with Dr. Perrault, proprietor of the j
resort, he left on August 16. Shortly after
his arrival the alcohol he had imbibed be
gan to show Its effects, and an attendant !
was placed over him.
On Saturday he developed symptoms j
of delirium tremens and the watch on
him was drawn closer. The next morn
ing the nurse, seeing Mr. Hayes appar
ently asleep, withdrew for a few minutes,
and on his return found his patient gone.
He immediately instituted a search, but
could not lind him. Appreciating his
condition and fearing that he might be
come violent and do himself or others an
injury, the now affrighted nurse notified
the doctors.
The last trace they got of him was that
he was headed up the mountains hatiess
and wild eyed. A resident of Salinas
who was encamped ln the vicinity
vouched for this fact. A searching party
was immediately set out in the hope of
finding him, but the 'missing matt had
disappeared as if he had been swallowed
up by the earth. Old hunters who know
every path and trail in the hills scoured
them, but without avail. The Sheriff of
the county was also notified, and he sent
telephone messages and deputies in all
directions, but was ' unable to locate
Hayes' whereabouts.
It is feared he crawled into the brush
and perished. This theory is based on the j
fact that the brush is extremely thick in I
the mountains, and if he did come to his I
senses it would be a difficult thing for
him to find his way out. The only water
to be had in the hills is said to be alkali j
and unfit for drinking purposes.
Another theory advanced by the hotel |
people is that Hayes, objecting to the |
close surveillance kept on him, watched j
his opportunity and slipped out, and in- \
stead of heading up the mountains went
in the opposite direction and boarded li
freight train at Soledad.
Mrs. Hayes was immediately notified of
her husband's disappearance, and she took
the first train for the springs. Seeing that â 
she could not improve on the efforts made
to find him she came home.
Mrs. Hayes called at police headquarters
last night and gave a detailed description
of her husband, and asked that every ef- â 
fort be made to find him. .

CYCLONE FORMING IN
MARTINIQUE ISLAND
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug. 26.â The
island of Martinique reports a cyclone
forming: south and moving toward Do
minica and Guadalupe.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Aug. 26.â A1l pos
sible preparations are being made against
the predicted storm. Meanwhile the mili
tary authorities are doing all in their
power to alleviate the conditions which
followed the recent cyclone. There is a
daily, distribution of rice, beans and cod
fish and supplies are sent to other dis
tricts, as rapidly as the transportation fa
cilities will permit. Official wages have
been fixed at five centavos an hour. Many
men have refused to work on these terms,
but some assistance is obtained from
boys.
The water is foul. Four thousand cubio
meters of mud and debris are piled in the
streets, the hospitals are overcrowded and
the temporary hospitals are filled; there
is a good deal of fever and malaria and
some typhoid; such houses as are stand
ing are overcrowded and there are thou
sands who are altogether homeless.

Republicans of the Coming Con-
gress to Support Gold-Standard
\ Legislation.
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â Members
elected to the Fifty-sixth Con-
gress have been asked by The
Call and Herald to Indicate their
preferences for successors of Speaker
Reed and Joseph W. Bailey, the mi-
nority leader, and to explain their po
sition ln regard to currency and trust
legislation.
Answers were given by a very large
proportion of the 357 members of the
House. It appears that David B. Hen-
derson of lowa will be elected Speaker
without Republican opposition. David
A. de Armond of Missouri seems to be
in the lead for the minority nomination.
The Republicans are practically
united in support of the currency bill,
which will be reported by the currency
committee named by the Republican
caucus. They expect this measure to
establish the gold standard unequivo
cally and to Increase National Bank
circulation, while breaking the "end-
less chain" of greenbacks. Democrats
from the South and West will advo
cate free silver coinage, the withdrawal
of National Bank circulation, the re-
tention of the greenback system and
the removal of the tax on State bank
notes.
That the trusts will furnish one of the
leading Issues of the season and of the
coming Presidential campaign Is un-
mistakably foreshadowed. From the
tenor of the replies made to the Her-
ald's questions there seems to be a pos
sibility and hope in some quarters that
the trust issue may eventually divide
the Republicans, and at the same time
unite the Democracy, which now
seems to be hopelessly split on the cur-
rency question. Californians expressed
themselves as follows:
Representative Barham â I have
reached the conclusion that, except in
a very limited way, the question of
trusts ls one calling for State and not
national legislation. Reviewing the
acts of Congress, now existing law on
the statute books. I am unable to see
what further legislation could be had
or made by Congress.
Representative Kahn â So far as cur- j
rency reform is concerned, I shall favor j
a gold standard and shall support such j
legislation as will tend to establish the ;
stability of the American dollar and
sustain its purchasing power in all the :
markets of the world. I consider trusts i
a menace to the welfare of our people,
and I certainly believe they should be j
made a national issue. I
Representative Loudâ regard to
trusts, I cannot say offhand what
should be the course pursued. Time ;

I*rom the day that a young man starts
eat to seek his first position to the end of
his business life, his health has a world to
do with his success. When a young man
applies to a business man for a position, his
personal appearance has a deal to do with
the outcome. "Personal appearance" does
not mean dress alone. It does not mean
exterior cleanliness alone. A young man
may be clean, so far as scap and water will
make him, but be disfigured by unsightly
pimples, eruptions and ulcerations on the
ekin. These are due to impurities in the
blood. The blood becomes impure because
it is improperly nourished. Instead of
receiving the life-giving elements of the
food, it receives the foul emanations of
indigestion, bilousness and costiveness.
The reason that Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery is the best remedy for
disorders of this description is that it goes
right to first causes. It gives a man an
appetite "like a horse." It facilitates the
flow of digestive juices. It corrects all
disorders of the digestion, and makes the
assimilation of the life-giving elements
of the food perfect. It invigorates the
liver. It purifies and enriches the blood.
It makes the muscles strong and active.
It tones and steadies the nerves. It makes
a young man look as he should â of
body, alert of brain and clean and whole-
some of skin. Medicine dealers sell it,
and have nothing "just as good."
" I had eczema in its worst form," writea
Austin Ramsey. Esq.. of Saltillo. Huntingdon
Co . Pa. " I tried three doctors but got no re-
lief I thought it would set rae wild, it itched
and burned so badly. The neighbors thought I
would never be cured. I took your * -Golden

I alone can demonstrate what ls the bet
: ter action to take. Anything that men-
aces the best interests of the country
should be held in subjection by nation
'' al control. The formation of trusts is
! wholly a question of State control.
Trusts judiciously and equitably man
aged are not a menace, and if some
'. of them menace the rights of the peo
ple as, a whole, Congress without doubt
; will and should enact some legislation
respecting them.
Representative Waters ln my opin
i ion currency reform is a question yet
' to be worked out and should have very
1 careful consideration by the Fifty-sixth
. Congress. Regarding trusts, I see no
| legal way that the Federal authorities
can successfully cope with the evils
! engendered thereby, except, perhaps,
' through the control of transportation
! companies. I see no reason why we
should not make the trusts a national
; issue if we can accomplish anything
i thereby.
Representative "Needham am In
; favor of currency reform, and my vote
; and influence will be used to the end
| that our currency may be placed upon
i a more permanent basis. I shall favor
j legislation, so far as Congress has au
thority for the purpose of minimizing
i the evils of trusts.
PLOT TO BOON
CIGAR FACTORY
Stock Was Small and
Heavily Insured.
Pr*claJ Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Aug. 26.â Excitement pre
vails here over what ls supposed to be a
plot to burn down the Redding Co-opera
tive Cigar Factory for the purpose of ob
taining insurance. The factory was start
ed two months ago by five men from Au
burn. F. Van Stavern was manager of the
company and Paul Newman secretary-
The business did not prove successful
and all the members of the company
dropped out but Van Stavern and Newman.
On Wednesday the two went to San Fran
cisco, leaving M. J. Fahey. a recent em
ploye, in charge. Fahey was arrested last
night for trying to sell unstamped cigars.
Mrs. Minnie Blome, who lives in the
building adjoining the factory, declares
that Newman tried on Monday to per
suade her to burn the building, offering
her a good price. She refused and Sheriff
Behrens thinks Fahey was to burn the
property.
The factory was entered and $100 worth
of stock was found. This is insured for
about $SOO. Newman owed $20 at the Tem
ple Hotel and the stock was attached by
the proprietor to-day.
ENGLAND THREATENED
WITH A DROUGHT
Thames Is Very Low and "Wells In
Southern Villages Are
Giving* Out.
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â A World cable
from London says: London and the
whole south of England are still sizzling
under a merciless, untempered tropical
sun. The present drought has been un
paralleled for seventy years. But for the
exceptional rainfall in the winter and
spring the effects would be far more seri
ous.
Wells are giving out in the villages de
pendent upon them. The Thames is lower
than for fifty years and cannot much
longer furnish sufficient supplies for the
London water companies, while the Lea.
which runs through the most populous
and poorest district in the East End, is
described by the sanitary officers as
merely an open sewer. Owing to the want
of water the London streets, especially
In the West End, where there are wood
and asphalt pavements, are frightfully
malodorous. " *
The water companies are evincing their
concern about supplies by Instituting
prosecutions on trivial charges of waste.
London, in short, has been brought face
to face with a most serious situation
owing to the greed and tyranny of the
water monopolies.
A hill for appropriating the water of
the London water monopoly interest will j
be one 'if the first to be introduced by the
next Government.
PASSED A DERELICT
OFF VANCOUVER ISLAND
Believed to Be the Mysterious Vessel
Seen Off Clayoquot
Sound.
PORT TOWNSEND. Aug. -Captain
A. L. Hammer of the schooner Lily L,
from Unalaska, reports to the British
nydrographlc offico that on August 16
he passed a derelict, which appeared to
be a three-masted square-rigged vessel.
The lower part of the mainmast, on
which was a gaff, was standing.
The hull was badly broken and a great
deal of the planking â¢ gone, showing the
ribs. The position of the derelict when
sighted was latitude 49:58 north, longitude
1:36:46 west, about 350 miles from the
north end of Vancouver Island. It is
thought that this is not the same dere
lict barkentine reported off Clayo-quot
Sound recently.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, 1899.
UNEXAMPLED
DEFEAT OF
THE KAISER
Action of the Diet on the
Canal Bill a Personal .
Blow.
WILLIAM IS ANGRY
Dares Not Punish Offending Leaders
Until He Recovers Lost
Strength.
Copyrighted. ISM. by thÂ« Associated Pree*.
BERLIN, Aug. 26.â The political sit-
uation this week has been highly In-
I teresting. The unexampled defeat of
j the Government ln the Diet, which,
: after his emphatic utterance at Dort
j mund, was a personal defeat of Em
: peror William, has engrossed attention,
to the exclusion of almost everything
I else. The fact that the blow was
dealt by the conservatives, a party
which has been favored and nursed for
' generations at the expense of every
' other party, made the event all the
more sensational. The absence of his
Majesty complicated the situation for
the Cabinet, and the Emperor, not hay-
ing expected the rejection of the canal
' bill, no provision was made as to what
' steps the Government would take .In
; such an event. After the final vote
both Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial
Chancellor, and Dr. yon Miquel. Vice
President of the Council of Ministers
: and Prussian Minister of Finance, not
: having any Instructions, neither the
Cabinet nor the Government press
knew what to say or do. For several
days political chaos reigned, 'even the
opposition press being at a loss.
Detailed reports had been wired the
Emperor, and every member of the
1 Cabinet participated in the debates, and
! his Majesty wrote and wired brief re
j plies in which it was apparent he felt
a keen sense of personal outrage and
meant to deal punishment to the worst
blunderers and offenders. That, how-
ever, was insufficient to let the Cabinet
see their way clear how to shade their
actions. It was only on "Wednesday
that the nation and the Cabinet began
to know precisely how the Emperor
stood and what were his intentions re-
garding the unprecedented situation,
nothing like this defeat having been
met with since the establishment of the
I Diet fifty years ago.
Wednesday's and Thursday's crown
councils, however, furnished light. It
! appeared that Emperor William, after
; mature reflection, had concluded not to
1 dissolve the Diet and not to accept the
resignation of the Cabinet. It was rep-
resented to his Majesty that the elec
tions might not result in a majority for
the canal project, while the dismissal of
the Cabinet and the formation of a new
one would present at this juncture new
and almost insurmountable difficul-
ties. To begin with, the Conservatives
formed almost half the membership of
the Diet, and the party strong enough
to govern must be on hand, which was
not the case.
Another weighty reason with his
Majesty is the consideration, skilfully
dwelt on by the conservative press, that
the Emperor absolutely needs a party
to restrain and fight the revolutionary
elements, notably the socialists.
The proposed partial reorganization
of the Cabinet, relieving It of some of
its inefficient members, like Baron yon
der Ecke and Baron yon der Horst,
the Minister of the Interior, has been
postponed to quieter times, his Majesty
meanwhile disciplining some of the
most refractory officials, who. as dele-
gates, voted and agitated against the
canal bill. Having resolved on this, the
present outcome of the crisis amounts
to next to nothing. The Emperor and
tho Cabinet will continue to govern
with the same party which brought on
the crisis.
Mild threats have been launched in
the entire press by the members of the
Government against, the Conservatives
and their leaders. These threats ap
peared for several days in such Govern-
ment organs as the Allegemeine Zei-
tung, Politische Correspondent, Neu-
stan Wachrichten, Hamburger Corre
spondent and others. The crisis is so
serious, however, that every member
of the Cabinet has been recalled to Ber
lin. Prince Hohenlohe even abandoned
his usual summer trip to Ausze, Aus
tria, and will remain in this city for
some time. The wildest rumors and
statements pervaded the papers during
the first half of the week. The entire
Liberal press Indulged ln the hope of a
radical change in the political system
of Prussia, the submerging of the Con-
servative and Agrarian elements and
the coming to the front of the Liberals
and the industrial Interests of the
country. It was the premature and In-
judicious publication of their hopes j
which startled the Emperor and made |
him retrace his steps to the Conserva
tive camp. The correspondent here of j
the Associated Press hears from a reli- j
able source that Prince Hohenlohe in- j
sisted on a dissolution of the Diet and I
the resigning of the Cabinet while Dr.
yon Miquel viewed the situation in the
light finally adopted by the Emperor.
Prince Hohenlohe, although he yield- j
ed, is heartily tired of office and cannot
well bear the burdens much longer. A |
most Interesting feature of the situa- I
tion was the attitude of the Conserva - j

! ular boycott has thus far been carried
I out. It intensely amuses the Vor

probably by the end of next week, after
the most pressing business has been

organs of the Agrarians, proclaimed
that it was high time the Emperor

lute ruler over vassals, but the leader
of a free nation." The paper admitted
the defeat of the canal bill. â  â¢;
The Kreua Zeitung, the old time or-
gan of the Prussian Conservatives,
threatened that if the Government
meant a change of attitude toward the
Conservatives, the latter would revise
their attitude toward the Government,
not only in the Diet but also in.the
Reichstag. The Kreuz Zeitung also
roundly abused Prince Hohenlohe, say

of the Diet.
The commercial relations existing be
tween Germany and the United States

THE COLUMBIA AND THE SHAMROCK
YACHTING experts in New York are by no
means sanguine that in the contest between the
Columbia and the Shamrock we are to have
anything extraordinary in the way of a record
breaking race. It is pointed out that in the trials be
tween them tlie Columbia has not shown herself
much superior to the Defender, while the fact that the
Britannia was beaten by the Meteor almost as badly
as by the Shamrock inclines to the belief that the new
challenger is by mo means such a notable improvement
on former British models of racing yachts as has been
reported.
Since the Shamrock has been studied in New York
the trust of Americans in the success of the Columbia
has been increased. A considerable number of yachts
men have declared they do not regard her as a dan
gerous rival, and express unshaken confidence in the
ability of the home yacht to retain the famous cup on
tin*, side of the water; but there are some authori
ties who hold that Sir Thomas Lipton has a chance to
win under certain conditions of wind and sea, inas
much as his boat will have considerable advantage in
heavy weather.
In an elaborate comparison of the two yachts a
writer for the New York Tribune says: "The Sham
rock has more freeboard, sits higher out of the water
than the Columbia, and does not look any better for
it. She is also more bulky in the build between the
midship section and the stern. Consequently she is
not as trim-looking a model as the American boat.
Whether this is a gain or a fault only trial will tell.
For a long time yachts have been pared away aft to
let them leave the water cleanly when they lie down
to their rail. But the latest high speed racers of Bos
ton have been carrying their beam far aft, and the
width of some of them at the stern is surprising. In
ether words, they prefer to have something to lie
down on rather than to study how to keep their lines
fine and leave the water cleanly. While, therefore,
it i- certain that the Columbia is much prettier in this
region, it by no means follows that her superior grace
means greater speed. There is a good deal of the
'brute' about the Shamrock. Unquestionably she can
carry canvas longer, and more of it. than the Co
lumbia if the ballast power of both boats is about the
same. The Shamrock will be dragging some water
when she is hard pressed over, but she will be lying
down on a good support that will be a powerful aid
to 'carrying on."
It i*- pointed out by the writer that superiority in
' "brute" power does not always win. The Valkyrie
had much more of it that the Defender, but in the
contests between the two it was never once called into
play, for there was never wind enough to enable the
Valkyrie to make use of her huge beam, and the
slim Defender, with more than two feet less of beam,
slipped away from her in every race.
From the judgments pronounced by the experts it
appears the two yachts are not unequally matched, and
that the issue of the contest will be determined partly
by the condition of the weather and partly by the
skill of the men who handle them. The story that
the Shamrock was badly strained while being towed
in her voyage across "the Atlantic is not generally
credited. The races are to be sailed under conditions
of perfect fairness, and the case seems to be one in
which the best sailors rather than the best yacht will
win. â

SEARCHING FOR SIGNIFICANCE.
THE long and highly sustained scries of events
planned to express the unanimous welcome
home of the First California Volunteers has
| gained all of its significance from* their personality
and their return to their homes and the pursuits of
'. peace. Some individual politicians may have used
1 the occasion to put themselves in the focus of public
attention, but as this is the politician's way, and noth-
ing can restrain him from using everything, from a
funeral to a fete, for that purpose, there is nothing un
usual in it. The people have paid for the welcome
and have turned out in hundreds of thousands to ex
press their respect for our fellow-citizens who have
been under arms and under fire, in obedience to
orders, in a hazardous war for which they volun
teered. No sensible person has considered it to mean
anything else. The cheers and tears and shouting
have been by those of all shades of opinion on
the issue of expansion, and of all sorts of political
belief. Silver and Gold Democrats, Republicans and
Populists, all put up their sound money that the city
might be garnished and in gay dress for the pleasure
of the soldier boys.
It has remained for the Evening Post to entirely
disconnect the great occasion from the presence and
the personality of the returned volunteers. It insists
that it is a unanimous expression in favor of incor
porating the Philippines into the United States, and
a demand that Dan Burns be elected Senator in order
to effect such incorporation!
This theory is important. No one else has devel
oped the relation of Burns to the holding of the
Philippines or the holding of anything else, except the
public nose. We had no idea that the case had be
come so bad that the Post sees in every group of con-
sulting citizens and in every* crowd of thousands a de-
mand for Burns. We have no doubt that that ambi
tious person has assumed that it is his campaign.
The welcoming fleet of ships and craft on the bay
were to him the enlistment of Neptune in his fight.
The thousands of electric globes that string the streets
are merely to light his march up the shining way to
the Senate. When the band played "Hail to the
Chief" he saluted himself and knew who wore the
said chief's clothes. The procession, from Shafter to
the last man and horse, was merely . his dopple-
ganger, and when the crowd roared its cheers and
the ladies turned every window into a casemate from
which to throw kisses, the luscious and light artillery
of osculation was all in action for his benefit.
The Post is quite positive in all this. It thinks that
not only the land and the people thereof crave for
Burns to take his scat in the Senate next December,
but the Pacific Ocean joins in the demand. It says
that wide sheet of water has prepared itself for "the
theater of the grandest national drama yet enacted on
the stage of human history," and the play will not go
on unless Burns is elected. If he is not, that ocean
will immediately cease to be a theater and will shrivel
to the petty purposes of a fishpond.
The Post should add that if Burns is not imme
diately commissioned Senator the sun will turn back
at Verdi and cease to beam on California at all. The
big trees will become saplings, the fig trees will bear
thistles, and disgusted nature will shrug her mighty
shoulder and shake the State back to eocene chaos
and black night.
In ail humility The Call ventures to assert that not
the one hundredth of one per cent of the people who
welcomed home our soldier boys had a thought of
the vacancy in the Senate, or of its perpetuation by
the election of Burns. Tiny were not even approv
ing or disapproving of the Philippine war. Its popu
larity or unpopularity did not figure in the event.
The whole occasion was a big-hearted, whole-fisted
welcome to men who had individually and as an or-
ganization shed great glory and imperishable honor
upon their State, and written a shining chapter in its
deathless history. It meant that and nothing else.
and that was enough. It is an insult to the soldiers
themselves and to the people who hailed them home
again so genuinely and heartily to put upon it any
other construction, and especially to reduce all this
hearty roar of good feeling into a shout for Dan
Burns.
There are scores of men in the First who marched
for miles between walls of warm hearts beating time
to their soldierly tread who are better fitted for the
Senate than the Post's candidate. Any one of these
scores can put off his weather-beaten uniform for the
Senatorial toga and wear it worthier than Burns.
But to the eye of the Post these young veterans had
no other place in all the pageantry but to act as sand
wich men bearing a sign inscribed, "Burns for Sen
ator."
Travel in Thibet has been usually regarded as
about the most dangerous on the globe, owing to the
fierce hostility of the natives to foreigners, but two
Englishmen who have just made a tour through the
country report that the Thibetans, while poor, have
a much higher moral standard than their wealthier
neighbors of the adjoining districts of Asia, that
travel is safe and robbery is unknown. It appears,
therefore, that by excluding foreigners the Thibet
folks have remained in poverty but preserved their
morals, and it remains for further investigators to
determine whether the morals are worth the loss of
the money!
THE STABILITY OF FRANCE.
SO many and so sensational are the disturbances
and- excitement that emanate from Paris, a con-
siderable portion of the world has come to the
conclusion that everything in France is in a condi
j tion of instable equilibrium and that a revolution
may occur at any time. Such opinions are not shared
by intelligent men who have closely studied the coun
try and the people. According to their testimony the
French, despite the strength of the military caste, are
' essentially a democratic people, and their institutions
' are about as stable as those of any in Europe.
The popular control of government in France is
by no means so slight or so uncertain as would ap
â  pear from the frequency with which Ministries are
changed in response to clamors on the Parisian boule
i yards. James B. Eustis, who was Minister to France
under Cleveland's administration, has in a recent ar
! ticle in the Conservative Review expressed a high
'.. opinion of the attachment of the people generally to
democratic ideas and of their power in directing legis
i lation along democratic lines. He says: "All the
; laws enacted by the French Assembly are in the in
terest of the masses of the people, and not in the in-
terest of any one class. In the contest between the
power of money and the rights of the people the
brutal influence of wealth is unknown in the politics
of France. * * * No class interests can claim to
exercise any influence over any department of the
j Government of the French republic. As the revolu
tionists of 1793 destroyed the aristocracy which sprung
fiom the nobility of birth, the French. republicans of
to-day will not permit the wealth of a class to con
; tiol the economic policy of their Government, but
'. rather the contrary, for it is the common â the work
'â â  ingâpeople who receive its protection and its favors.
| The spirit of true democracy is so intense in the

French people that they have no reason to apprehend
that their republic will be undermined by the- cor
rupting wealth of a political aristocracy."
.Nor is it against the money power only that French
democracy is holding its own.' The fact that public
opinion has forced the military chiefs to concede a
new and an open trial to Dreyfus is an evidence of
ilie ability of the people to guard against the army as
mVi as against the aristocracy of wealth whenever the
need arises. Excitements, disturbances and not in
frequent riots are the natural accompaniments of free
governments. There could be no Dreyfus affair in
any ether country of Continental Europe, but the
reason is not that other countries are more stable or
more just than France, but solely because public
opinion, having there no freedom to prompt to ac
tion, can produce neither bad nor good results.
The dispatches announce that a triple execution of
murderers at Dawson passed off without special in
cident. It is reasonable to suppose that the mur
derers had a different view of the event.

JUGGLING WITH STATISTICS.
DURING his term of office as Chief of the
Bureau of Statistics of the Treasury Depart-
ment Joseph Nimmo Jr. was instructed to in-
vestigate the commercial aspects of the proposed
canal connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific and
compute the amount of tonnage likely to pass through
such a waterway. His report was highly encouraging
to the advocates of the enterprise and did much to
bring about popular approval of it. Since leaving
the office Mr. Nimmo's services have been at the dis
posal of the opponents of the canal, and he has now
a very different set of figures to show as the result of
his computations.
In the pamphlet recently issued and widely circu
lated he attempts an explanation of the discrepancy
between what he said then and what he says now.
Referring to the computations made while Chief of
the Bureau of Statistics he says:
"The work was one of considerable magnitude. It
was begun in the month of February and completed
in the month of August, 1880. I reported a possible
tonnage of 1,625,000 tons per annum for any one of
the proposed canals. Since the year 1880 seven trans-
continental lines and parts of lines have been com-
pleted, the facilities for transportation by rail have
been greatly increased, there has been an enormous
development of transcontinental traffic, and, as al-
ready shown, rates have greatly fallen. In a word,
the general trend of the evolution of transportation
facilities during the last twenty years has been in
the direction of reducing the possible tonnage of any
American interoceanic canal. From a computation
based upon all the controlling. conditions of the pres
ent day I conclude that not more than 400,000 tons of
shipping annually can be confidently expected to pass
through any such canal. The receipts of any Ameri-
can interoceanic canal from tolls would therefore be
insufficient to meet the expenses of its maintenance
and administration, with nothing for interest on cost
of construction, amounting probably to $8,000,000 a
year."
The passage is interesting as an illustration of the
ease with which clever statisticians can make their
I computations suit their desires and serve as argu
j ments for the object they wish to attain. In 1880, ac-
cording to Mr. Nimmo, the tonnage likely to pass
through either one of the canals would have been over
1,600,000 tons per annum, but now, after nearly
twenty years of increase in commerce, the tonnage
would not exceed 400,000. The logic of the argument
is that as commerce increases the demand for a canal
decreases, and the explanation of the paradox is that
railroads are now doing the work that would have
been taken by the canal in former years.
It requires no great cleverness nor any considerable
! knowledge of the statistics of commerce to refute so
plain a fallacy. The construction of additional trans-
continental railroads has not led to a decrease in the
traffic of the old ones, but has created an additional
traffic. Neither has the increase in railroads been fol-
lowed by a decrease of tonnage afloat, but has been
accompanied by an increase of such tonnage. In-
creased facilities for commerce are always followed
by an increase of commerce itself.
Under the most favorable conditions it will require
at least ten years to complete a canal across either of
the suggested intero'cean routes, and Mr. Nimmo will
be a very clever statistician indeed if by any compu
'. tation he can convince the American people the ton-
nage passing through the canal at that time will be
less than it would have been twenty years ago.

COPYRIGHT IN SPEECHES.
SOMETHING of a novel principle in copyright
law has recently been established by the High
Court of Justice in Great Britain in a case to
which the London Times and Lord Rosebery were
parties. It appears that in preparing a volume of his
"Speeches and Appreciations" Rosebery* included five
speeches taken almost verbatim from the reports in
the Times, and the newspaper at once brought suit
to restrain the publication on the ground that its re
ports of the speeches were copyrighted and the pub
lication would be an infringement of its rights.
The court decided for the newspaper and granted an
injunction .against the publisher. As the decision
means that one man may copyright the speeches of
another and thus prevent the speaker from republish
ing the reports, it has naturally given rise to a good
deal of discussion. The ground upon which the de
cision was based is that there is no such thing as
copyright of ideas; it is all a matter of literary form.
The reporter gave the speeches the written form, and
hence he is entitled to the exclusive control of that
form. Lord Rosebery gave his words and thoughts to
the public at large. If he had written them out in the
beginning and had copyrighted them before speaking
them he could have retained possession. Failing to
do this, the reporter was entitled to become the ex
clusive owner of his version of the speech.
Under this decision it appears that if an orator in
Great Britain desires to retain any property in his
speeches he must take out a lecturer's copyright,
otherwise his ideas will belong to the reporter who
first translates them from spoken to written language
and copyrights them. The decision is good law and
is unquestionably just, but at the same time its novelty
renders it rather startling. The doctrine that an
orator has no rights to his own ideas until he has
copyrighted them will have a tendency to increase
the revenues of the copyright office by a considerable
percentage. >g

and vociferous time." Visitors from the
interior who witnessed the celebration
and shared in its raptures will be con
spicuous among their fellow citizens
when they return home by the size of
their heads and their demand for hats
a little larger than they really ought
to wear. Among our own citizens there
will be, of course, no such distinction
of persons, for the heads and the hearts
of all have expanded in unison. We are
all somewhat bigger, brighter and bet
ter than ever before because we know
we have done the right thing in the
right way at the right time and have
sufficient self-appreciation to be proud
of it. Moreover, the end is not yet, for
it is safe to say most folks will no
sooner get out of bed on this day of
rest than they will proceed to have a
frolic for the rest of the day.

There have been in other cities many
greater and more brilliant pageants
than those which during the week have
been displayed on our bay and along
our streets, but there never has been
one in the world where so large a pro
portion of the whole people took part,
or where the popular ardor and en
thusiasm were greater. As a popular
demonstration of honor to brave men
the reception accorded to California's
heroes has never been surpassed.
The significance of the demonstra
tion will not escape the mind of
any thoughtful person. The American
people are not warlike In the ordinary
meaning of the word. They are not
inordinately fond of military glory, nor
have they any aspirations for battles
and conquests. Nevertheless, when a
Just cause for war arises the republic
never lacks for volunteers to take up
arms and follow the flag wherever
duty calls. Thousands of those who
thronged the streets to cheer the vol
unteers would as readily have enlisted
to follow them across the sea had the
nation needed them In continuance of
a war for liberty, for Justice and foi*
humanity. The reception given to the
volunteers who in the Philippines
have attested their devotion to the re
public and their willingness to give life
itself for their country was therefore
one of fullest sympathy, and the re
sounding acclamations were expressions
of the deepest and truest as well as
the most joyous and jubilant of emo
tions.

Whoever saw Market street in the
glow of its illuminations must have felt
like taking off his hat to the memory
of the pioneers who planned for the
city in Its early days that magnificent
thoroughfare. It seemed to have been
ordained prophetically for this partic
ular occasion, and with the innumer
able lights, many colored and various
as the rainbow, festooned above it and
walling it in, the great avenue was
more mystically and beautifully gor
geous than ever was the Sacred Way
that led to the temple of the Capitollne
Jove when adorned for the pomp and
splendor of imperial triumphs.
We have indeed, for once at any rate.
accomplished something artistic and
splendid in the way of street illumina
tion. There was no evidence any
where of lack of taste or lack of money.
From where the tapering tower of the
ferry depot rose like a shaft of light
against the darkness, to where the
dome of the illuminated City Hall
shone resplendent, the glittering lights
were everywhere as multitudinous as
the eye desired. The whole street /was,
in fact, like a setting for a grand opera
and formed a fitting stage for the ex
ultant drama of glorious life that was
enacted upon it.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Before the glow of delight in the
festival dies away and our thoughts
are made dry as dust by the municipal
campaign that impends above us.
something in the way of public thank.-.
and testimonial should be given to the
members of the executive committee
to whom we are all Indebted for the
success of the reception. When the
committee first announced Its plans
and asked for $50,000 to carry them out,
the proposition was regar led as an ex
travagance. Many persons declared
the sum could not be raised, and for
a time the committee had but a half
hearted support even from the most
generous. The plans, however, were
well devised. Anything less magnifi
cent would have aroused less ardor.
The longer the people meditated upon
the subject the more were they pleased
with the brilliancy of the undertaking.
In the end, as is now well known, the
whole people responded to the commit
tee's leadership, and we have had a
celebration that will have a national
reputation. Therefore while we are
cheering it is but right there should be
three times three and a tiger for the
executive committee. .
â¢ â¢ â¢
Next to the patriotism displayed in
the warmth of the reception given to
the volunteers the most notable feature
of the festival was the delight of the
people in the beauty of the decorations
and in the freedom of the holiday. We
are clearly an artistic, glad-hearted,
pleasure loving community. The crowds
that thronged the streets night after
night were happy and were gay in the
exuberance of their joy in a frolic. We
are not of that class of Americans who
"take their pleasures sadly" and who
can never be merry except when
drunk. The geniality of the climate,
the prevalence of prosperity and the
Influence of the Latin elements of the
population have developed the joyous
faculties of our natures, and that for
mal dullness which marks the holiday
crowds of the East is conspicuous here
by Its total, thorough and very far off
absence. It is evident that if a com
pany of whole-souled men with'well
filled purses should undertake to . pro
vide the city with an annual festival
week New Orleans would soon lose her
prestige as the Carnival City of the
United States. Indeed, it is not un
likely we might make our gala days
as world renowned as were those of
Venice In the years of her glory.

We are. a gay people and a dandy
people and a people of large toleration,
but' neither so gay. so dandy nor so
tolerant as some Eastern ftlks think
us, or pretend to think us. The Boston
Herald has a correspondent who has
Just been visiting our metropolis and
who describes it as "a wide-open town,"
an "isolated town" far remote from civ
ilization, where all sorts of folks do
all sorts of things. Then he says:
"This sense of isolation is greatly en
joyed by the Eastern tourist and as
much by the ladies as by the men. A
very fashionable woman indeedâ when
at home on the Atlantic seaboard
confesses that the other evening at
high midnight she sat in a lace*.
screened box in a "hall," and there wit
nessed the exposition' of Little Egypt.
" Tt was so like Paris.' declared the
truant lady. 'But, poor thing! poor
little Egyptâ must have had the
stomach ache! You see, when I am in
Rome I do as Romeo does!' "
All of which goes to show that when
Boston respectability. is In San Fran
cisco, Boston respectability has a good
timeâ and who can blame it? It is not
fair, however, for the frolicsome dames
to pretend that in all their frolics they
are but living according toÂ» our views ;
of life. It is of course proper "when
in Rome to do as Romeo does," but it
appears the Boston Juliet sometimes
overdoes it and makes Rome howl.
* * â¢
Having quoted that story from the
Boston Herald man it is only fair to j
him to add that on the whole makes j
a good report of us to our well-beloved '
Eastern kin. Thus he says that what
most Impresses the stranger'ln San
Francisco Is the tendency of the people
toward independent judgment In all !
matters, social, literary or artistic; and j
he adds:
There is a disinclination to accept es- j
tablished verdicts and a desire to form i
an opinion based upon the facts In the
case. This is shown In the reception ac- !
corded to celebrities of all sorts, from i
those of the army and navy, the church I
and the state, to those of the stage or I
"the smart set." Some very great people,
indeed, in their own estimation, when in !
the East, are "small pumpkins" indeed \
out here, whereas merit is readily recog- j
nized, and an actress, for example, does I
not need to enjoy a New York or London
reputation to be in vogue in San Fran
cisco, and vice versa.
That statement Is pleasing and thor- |
oughly satisfactory. It will be read i
with general gratification and approval, |
not because it is in praise of us, but -
because it is true. We do not care for j
flattery, but we do like to have visitors \
speak well of us because such speaking j
shows they appreciate merit and can J
tell the truth. That Is always pleasing.

Many men and women of many

AN APOLOGY.
On Reading the Browning Love Letters.
Forgive, sweet lovers of this book,
The sad, who scan your story;
Forgive their wistful eyes that look-
Forgive, sweet lovers of this book,
Their knowledge where your fingers shook;
Their watching of your glory;
Forgive, sweet lovers of this book,
The sad, who scan your story.
Accept, true lovers here enshrined.
The few who share your gladness
In touch of heart, and soul and mind;
Accept, true lovers here enshrined,
Their seeing of themselves defined.
Their growth of joy from sadness â
Accept, true lovers here enshrined.
The few, who share your gladness.
Condone, great loversâ being dead.

Nor shrink that we we too, have read,
Condone, great. loversâ being dead,
Our vision of the gold you shedâ
For hearts in coming ages,
Condone, great loversâ dead,
The printing of these pages.
If that exquisite bit of verse do not
give to all lovers of fine literature a joy
sufficient to induce them to read it
more than once, and to thank me for
digging it for them out of the welter
of the verse of the day, then I don't
know enough about what is poetically

Persons who wish a day of complete
mental as well as physical rest and
relaxation after the strenuous intel
lectual exertions of the week may let
their brains repose upon this conun
drum which is now going the rounds
in the East, having taken the place of
the kissing bug and filling it so full
the bug is not missed:

a capacity of 6000 tons of steam, loaded

he is a good ambulance driver, but the

I submit the conundrum to the atten
tion of the worthy for two reasons
first, as an illustration of how very
silly in the East are.the amusements of
the silly season; second, because it is
asserted there Is an answer to the
conundrum, and as I do not know it I

From the frequency of the Iteration
and reiteration of the report that the
marriage of Lily Langtry to young De
Bathe was due to the match-making of
the Prince of Wales, a suspicion arises
that there Is a theatrical advertisement
in the story, and that we are to have
the bride among the dramatic stars of
the next season. Of course, if she come
she will be welcome, for she is likely
to be a better Lily and she cannot be a
worse actress than she was when we
received her before. It ls to be remem
bered that even in the old days she
showed her appreciation of the true
and the beautiful by purchasing a
ranch in California with the intention
of living in a state of decorum. Mar
riage, like charity, covers a multitude
of sins, and, besides, it counts for
something that Lily has taken a Bathe.

The court-martial now going on at
The court-martial now. going on at
Rennes may not solve all the mys
teries of the Dreyfus case, but one of
the episodes of it has come near to fur
nishing an answer to the old question,
"Who shall decide when doctors dis
agree?" When M. Labori was taken
home after being shot Dr. Reclus, a
member of the French Academy of
Medicine and a professor of surgery,
was called in to attend him. The treat
ment of Reclus was not approved by
Dr. Doyen, who is also a surgeon of
eminence, and between the two dig
nitaries there arose a dispute which has
been called "sensational." In such a
disagreement who should decide? La
bor! decided. He got up out of bed and
went about his business just as boldly
as if he had a legal right to interfere
in the case and settle it to his own ad
vantage. Moreover, as the doctors
when last heard from were still
wrangling, Labori may yet have the
satisfaction of getting a fat fee from
one of them for prosecuting the other.
The French are queer people.
CARRIER PIGEON KILLED.
The Bird Was Bringing a Mes-
sage to The Call.
Santa Rosa Press-Democrat.
Late yesterday afternoon Superintend
ent M. H. Damon of the sewer farm
picked up his shotgun and started out in
quest of birds. He had only proceeded a
short distance when he saw a fine pigeon
feeding not far away, and -killed it. V\ hen
he came to examine his game he found.
that he had killed a carrier pigeon. On
one leg was a thin metal band bearing
the number "A 1489." To the other a
mesage had been attached reading as fol
lows: Â .
"4:35 p. m.â Farralones abeam, dist. one
"4:35 p. m.âFarralones abeam, dist. one

Houdlette." 'v*
Inquiry develops the fact that among the
steamers leaving San Francisco Wednes
day was the Spreckels steamship Austra
lia" bound for Honolulu. The officer in
charge is Captain Houdlette. Lnaer the
circumstances there is little reason to
doubt that the message was intended ror
John D. Spreckels, proprietor of the ban
Francisco Call, and was a special report
to the effect that up to the time stated
the Australia had seen nothing or tne
anxiously awaited transport Sherman,
having on board the volunteers returning
from the Philippines.
As stated in the message and as re
ported in the newspapers, the atmosphere
in the vicinity of the Farallones Wednes
day afternoon was very hazy. Later on a
fog rolled in. The little messenger doubt
less became lost in the fog and instead of
flvlng toward home headed north, a tact
that not only delayed the mesage but
resulted in the messenger meeting with a
sad and untimely death besides.

Why the Naval Parade Was a Success
Â» Oakland Tribune.
Speaking of the bay parade on Thurs
day an Oaklander familiar with such
things said: "Too much credit cannot be
given Commodore Spreckels for the suc
cess of the affair. I never saw so many
steam and sailing vessels in a bunch be
fore. There was no confusion, no hitches
and no accidents. Everybody in charge
of a vessel of any kind knew exactly his
place and he kept out of every other fel
low's place. The line was formed with
much discretion and the picture made
was magnificent. Commodore Spreckels.
In regulation uniform, from the deck of
the Fearless, directed things with two
small launches and proved himself a mas
ter of such work. Just think of ten thou
sand people on the bay with the innumer
able craft to carry them and not even a
hat fell overboard or a single vessel s
paint scratched. The line moved just
when everybody expected it would and no
one felt uneasy or alarmed in any way.
If everybody who has anything to do with
the sodiers' reception does as well or half
as well as John D. Spreckels the event
will be long remembered."
A Record for "Scoops."
The Fourth Estate.
The San Francisco Call is making a
great record for "scoops." A few weeks
ago The Call was the flrst newspaper
In the world to contain the news of the
battle of Samoa, and on July 30 it was
again the flrst to publish the report of the
Samnan Commissioners on the condition
of affairs In the islands and the steps that
have been taken to establish a stable gov
ernment. _. -i - ,
The report of the Samoan Commission
is one of the most important diplomatic
documents of the year, and ln obtaining a
copy and publishing it in advance The
Call achieved one of the greatest suc
cesses of journalism. The Commissioners
arrived a week later.

$40,000 for the lease and Means $15.

poor rancher, whose property adjoins
that of Means, also made a big deal.

was enthusiastically received by the
large audience. It was a plea for or

SANTA BARBARA. Aug. 26.â Officers of
the northern end of the county are in hot
chase after a man named Freeman, who
hails from Chino and who ran away with
a 13-year-old girl about a week ago.
Freeman is an all-around sport, gam
bler and race. horse man. The sorrel race
horse, which has untold speed, was driven
into Chino several months ago attached to
an old buckboard, with his tail and mane
full of barley beards and appearing half
starved and ungroomed. Several match
races for different sized purses were made.
and an afternoon set aside for a race
meet. The sorrel horse entered every
race, coming out in the lead in each one.
No matter how fast the race, the horse
would leave his adversary far in the
lurch. This was repeated in Pomona.
Riverside and neighboring towns. A week
ago Thursday, it is alleged. Freeman stole
a 13-year-old Mexican girl, and it was
thought that -he was making for Mexico.
and the officers were in hot pursuit in that
direction, but the object of their search
was going in the opposite direction. He
passed through this city last Tuesday.
Wednesday he was at Barons, about
twenty-five miles north of here. Thursday
he passed through San Julian ranch and
Friday was seen in Lompoc.
It was not until yesterday that officers
of this county began the chase. It will
be but a matter of a few hours, it Is
thought, when he will be behind prison
bars. Santa Barbara's Sheriff is hot on
the trail, and he declares the man cannot
escape his clutches.

CHACORNAC HOME IN FRONT
IN THE CLASSIC FUTURITY
James R. Keene's New Purchase Starts Favorite in
the Betting and Lands the $42,000 Purse.
SPENCER, THE CALIFORNIAN, HAS THE MOUNT
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â A perfect
start, a clean and unsullied race,
with the new Keene colt running
easily into first place, with nine
teen colts and fillies thundering be-
hindâsuch, in brief, is the story of the
twelfth renewal' of the Futurity stakes.
The Brookdale bred colt Chacornac
got a good start. It was like a line of
cavalry at the word "Charge." He ran
easily under Spencer's guidance, slowly
forging ahead of his field until the last
corner was turned and as the expiring
rush came on and as Brigadier made
his best jump Chacornac slipped under
the wire an easy winner in the second
best Futurity time on recordâ l:lo 2-5.
Ogden had cleared the Futurity course
in 1:10, but good judges considered the
track to-day from one to two seconds
slower than when Ogden made the rec
ord, so Chacornac suffers nothing by
comparison.
By one of those inexplicable touches
of nature the former owner of Chacor-
nac, Mr. Thompson, and the winning
owner, Mr. Keene, stood side by side
on the clubhouse piazza during the
race. Mr. Keene was pale and agi
tated, Mr. Thompson buoyant and
cheerful. As the crowd at the farther
end of the stand took up the shout,
-Keene wins," Mr. Keene heaved a deep
sigh and, turning to Mr. Thompson,
grasped his hand. Soon the horses
swept under the wire, and the new
purchaser's number was run up. The
clubhouse crowd surged about Mr.
Keene to congratulate him. while his
son Foxhall, led a triumphal proces
sion within the doors to celebrate in
magnums.
As the former and the present o^ner
I of Chacornac stood together, in perfect
contentment, it was suggested that
now was the proper time to tell tha
price paid for the exchange.
"I will tell if you will, said Mr.
Keene to Mr. Thompson.
"I will tell if you will," answered Mr.
Thompson, and neither told except to
Bay that anything printed about the
price heretofore was wide of the mark.
It seems to have been one of those
transactions in which each party was
supremely satisfied with the result. Mr.
TTT-E RAX FRANCISCO CAT/L. gTO-TDAT, AUGUST 27, 1899.
CHACORNAC, WINNER OF THE RICH PRIZE.
FUTURITY WINNERS OF THE PAST.
Keene backed his new purchase moder
ately. L. S. Thompson sent a "too-late"
commission into the ring, but his broth
er, William P. Thompson, gathered in
$5000 on the race.
The day was not a pretty one for rac
ing or for morning crowds. J. H. Brad
ford, one of the principal executive of
ficers of the Coney Island Jockey Club,
received reports of the attendance in a
little glass-surrounded corner of the
club stand, which he has had built to
protect his Invalidism.
"About fifteen thousand, we make it,"
said his henchmen from the gates. This
is rather below the average Futurity
attendance, but the lowering skies of
the morning easily accounted for the
falling off, especially in the pretty
woman line. There is nothing gained
in spoiling a delicate muslin or chiffon
gown, and still worse is it to be seen at
Sheepshead Bay in anything that is not
especially smart. .If two thousand
women stayed away on account of the
threatening weather, then It is safe to
say that five thousand men did like
wise; 2% to 1 are not bad odds to ven
ture on such a calculation.
The Futurity, unhappily, occurred at
a time when New York society is utter
ly scattered and busily engaged in the
pursuits of Newport, Bar Harbor,
Lenox, Narragansett and the whole
stretch of coast and mountain from
Cape May to White Mountains.
The Long Island hunting set. which
always adds grace and beauty to the
Suburban, are not within call of the
Futurity. The boxes of the Belmonts,
the Hltchcocks, the Keenes, the Mor
timers, the Birds, the Ripleys, the
Kennedys, the Laniers, the Morgans
and the rest of that fascinating fol
lowing of good racing, were occupied
by others equally interested in the
thoroughbred, perhaps not so well
known in the bouts and routs of Upper
Fifth avenue, but all supremely well
dressed and quite as attractive and
chic as any crowd ever seen at Long
champs or Deanville.
From the boxes all down through the
rows of grand stand seats there was
a succession of delightfully cool-looking
costumes in pale blue, pink and mauve,
with all sorts of picture hats and
feathers and furbelows, with neat lit
tle wraps, all ready for the inevitable
shower, which happily held off until the
day's sport was about over. t
If there were plenty of shirt waists
and shirt sleeves sprinkled among the
big crowd,- they only went to show thai
this was a purely representative Amer
ican crowd, a regular Futurity crowd
.when employes were looking forward
to becoming great bankers and the suit
modelâ 36 bust, 43 skirtâ had an eye
upon a Fifth avenue residence.
A finer lot of two-year-olds never left
Sheepshead Bay paddock than filed out
at half-past 4 o'clock en route to the
post for ;â¢ the great Futurity. There were
twenty in all and each trained to the
hour, ready for the struggle over a try
ing course one hundred and seventy
feet less than three-quarters of a mile,
with one slight bend. David Garrick,
with Jenkins, a Western jockey, in
Pierre Lorlllard's famous cherry and
black, led the parade. The big son of
Hanover and Peg Wofflngton looked
the ideal thoroughbred and 134 pounds
appeared to rest lightly on his back*
Still it was a tremendous load to ask
the youngster, to carry such a journey.
and few experienced turfmen cared to
back him. â .. â *.... : -
Tlie Keene trioâ Doublets Little Mc-
Cue up: Virginia Earle, Maher astride,
and Chacornac, with Spencer as pilot
followed in the order named and there
was no mistaking which the hearty ap
plause was for. The Juvenal gelding,
big, strong and restless, looked from
side to side eager to break away.
Spencer patted him, talked to him and
kept him in his place passing the stand.
Then he almost wheeled, so nervous
and impatient was he to get to running.
Gulden, with Taral in the saddle, was
quiet and docile, and Tenderloin, with
the California boy, Piggott, on his back,
looked handsome enough to do great
things. .
Green Morris' pair, Modrine and
Water King, guided respectively by
j Bullman and Wedderstroud, were
quickly recognized, and then came
"Pittsburg Phil's" badly named son of
I Russell, and Active," Prestidigitator,
with unlucky Sims on his back Plucky,
of whom much was expected, looked
like a great torn, and "Harry" Lewis
appeared to enjoy his seat. Marcus
Daly's colors were borne by St. Finnan,
who, though he had not shown much
form ln his races, was much respected
for his recent work. Musette, daughter
of Juvenal, with Clayton up. Knight of
Rhodes, with O'Cleary in the saddle, and
King Bramble, with Clawson astride,
followed in the order named, and then
walked the Bromley pair, Windemere
and Iroquois Belle, piloted by O'Connor
and Shaw.
Windemere, the particularly good
looking son of Iroquois and Trade
Wind, came in for much admiration by
the shrewd training element, who re-
gretted only that lt was the colt's first
time at the post. A round of applause
for the next horse and jockey revealed
little Odom on .The Scotchman. Pale
from his recent illness, the result of a
bad fall on Brighton Beach, the pride
of the saddle bent his head in recogni
tion of the greeting. Few thought that
Mr. Clark's colt had much chance to
win. but everybody knew that the boy
in the saddle would make the horse do
his best. John Daly's Erwin, J. Hill
up, led the Hyland pair. Okettee and
Brigadier trailed the long procession.
Hennessy had the mount on Okettee,
who ran in J. Boden's colors, but was
coupled in the betting with Brigadier,
who had "Tommy" Burns for a pilot.
The last named cold looked fit to race
for his life, and nearly all the trainers
I talked to in the paddock during the
toilet-making of the candidates agreed
that he was the horse to beat. Once
past the grandstand, the colts broke
into jogs and canters and quickly took
up their positions at the post.
This was the order, Windemere being
next the rail with the starter: Knight
of Rhodes, Doublet, Plucky, Brigadier,
Chacornac, Okettee, Iroquois Belle,
Water King. St. Finnan, Gulden, King
Bramble, David Garrick, Modrine, Er
win, Musette, Virginia Earle, Prestidi
gitator, Tenderloin, The Scotchman,
Windemere.
According to the opinion of the own-
ers, trainers and jockeys Windemere
had the best position and Knight of
Rhodes the worst. The favorites
Chacornac and Brigadierâ however,
were as badly off as Knight of Rhodes.
The horses lined up in good order,
less fractious than most big fields of
two-year-olds, and then several chafing
against the bit broke away. Brought
back again into position, they appeared
to be on even terms when the starter
told them to "Come on," and, moving
as one body, they jumped forward as
nicely lined as such a big field could
possibly be, and the word "Go!" and
the dropping of the flag, simultaneous
ly, witnessed one of the quickest and
fairest starts ever seen.
Modrine had a trifle the best of It, but
Doublet, Virginia Earle and Chacor-
nac were close up, and Windemere and
Plucky and Brigadier were lapped on
them. In the first quarter all were
driving hard, for there was that wicked
turn Into the main track only a short
distance away, and every boy knew
that the flrst horse around the corner
would not have to take any chance of
being crowded out and would be better
straightened for the run home.
Bullman on Modrine was at work
with hands and heels in the effort to
stay in the lead. . As they neared the
end of the main track Modrine began
to fall back, and as they straightened
out the bay gelding Chacornac poked
his white nose in front. Spencer's red
cap and blue and white spotted jacket
showed up plainly now, for he was
clear of the bunch on the outside. The
race was by no means over, however,
for Brigadier was coming with a rush,
and in front of him shone the bright
yellow jacket of O'Connor on Winde-
mere. The last furlong pole was
reached in safety without jostling or
crowding, and then it was apparent
that it was over, for Chacornac was go-
ing easily, Spencer having a bit up his
sleeve in case of accidents, while every
boy was driving hard behind him.
The pace was a little too hot for
Windemere and he began to drop back
for Burns, who was working hard on
Brigadier and wearing him down fast,
until a sixteenth from home the son of
Rayon dOr got his head in front and
; was sure of second place. Spencer was
still going ably on -Chacornac and as
1 they went over the finish line the laftter
j^___B_____la-_*>nÂ»____-__j_Fi-_____.__i__^_-Â»i__jlH^^^
had something more than a neck the
best of it, although he might have made
it more had he been so inclined. Briga
dier was in second place clear of the
others, while Windemere staggered
home a scant head in front of St. Fin
nan, and there was little daylight be
tween the others. Modrine, who had
made the pace, had to be content with
fifth place.
Only yesterday James R. Keene pur
chased Chacornac from James Rowe
for a sum announced to be $25,000.

CHACORNAC'S CAREER.
Is an English Bred Horse, More
Muscular Than Good Looking.
NEW YORK, Aug. Chacornac
was bred by L. S. and W. P. Thompson,
sons of the late Colonel Thompson of
Virginia, at Brookdale Farm, in New
Jersey. More Futurity winners have
come from that establishment than
from any other. Chacornac's sire,
Juvenal, is an English horse. He is
a chestnut with blazed face, of heroic
proportions and splendid muscular de
velopment. Colonel Thompson himself
went to England to make the selection.
When he brought Juvenal home many
old-time American turfmen told him he
had made a mistake.
Chacornac Is not unlike his sire in
appearance, particularly behind the
withers. ' He has Juvenal's big barrel
and tremendous quarters. He also has
great depth through the heart. Chacor
nac ls not a good-looking horse from
an artistic point of view. He Is rather
ugly, In fact. He is slightly sway
backed and has a coarse-looking head
and neck. -Great muscular power rath
er than grace Is his chief characteris
tic. His dam, Lactitla, Is one of the old
Brookdale matrons. The last good
horse she produced was the speedy
Wilkins.

Bock of- Ages and Bona

George Malcom's brindle and white
greyhound Van Cloie was drugged while
in her kennel yesterday afternoon. Some
miscreant administered an overdose of
belladonna, which brought her to a stand
still in her course with T. Kelly's Wild
wood. Van Cloie was a three to one fa-
vorite and should, on form, have led her
opponent all the way. The opposite was
the case.
Van Cloie could not raise a gallop, lag
ging further and further behind. She tin
ally came to a standstill and had to be
helped back to her kennel. Her trainer.
"Mike" Nealon, had difficulty in saving
her life. He bled htr and administered
restoratives and finally brought her
around. "Some person gave her bella
donna," said Mr. Nealon when questioned
regarding the actions of the greyhound in
his charge. "It must have been given
while I was in the field, a half-hour be
fore. I had three dogs running in three
courses in succession, and that took my
two assistants into the field. I did not
notice anything the matter with her until
she was slipped to the hare."
Judge Bull rendered no decision on the
course, thus in effect declaring all bets
off. An effort will be made to punish the
guilty person if he can be found.
The coursing throughout the day was
excellent. The hares proved strong, a
number of them making good their escape.

PART TAKEN BY TROOPS
RIOTERS DID NOT SUFFER VERY
GREATLY.
General Declares That Ail Arrests
Were by the Idaho State Au
thorities and Not by
His Orders.
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug-. 26.â The report
of Brigadier General H. C. Merriam,
:omr__an<_er of the Department of the
Colorado. U. S. A., ln the miners'
riots in the State of Idaho was received
here to-day.
General â.am .elves a detailed his
tory of the events so far as he or the
troops under his command took part.
He shows that the arrests of alleged
participants in the riots were made by
the State authorities, the Federal
troops only acting as guards. At first.
he says, prisoners were quartered in a
large building: originally erected for the
storage of hay. Some suffering from
lack of fires and" bedding occurred, but
regarding the food furnished the gen
eral says:
"By dally inspections I satisfied my
self that the prisoners were being fur
nished abundant food and well pre
pared, although it sometimes unavoid
ably happened that meals were served
late and somewhat irregularly, owing
to the large number, irregular hours of
arrival and limited facilities for serv
ing." ______J-B|
When the building was full about 20"*'
prisoners were kept in boxcars. While
they were not comfortable. General
Merriam says they wen not compelled
to sleep on the ground, as were the sol
diers guarding them. Finally the gen
eral became dissatisfied with the
progress made In the erection of the
prison which the State authorities had
started and made a protest to Governor
Steunenberg, after which better prog
ress was made.
The report shows that the Governor,
not General Merriam. declared martial
law. and that the proclamation for
bidding the employment of uniou
miners in.the mines at Wardner man
ated entirely from the State authori
ties. Copies of teleerams and letters
from the Secretary of "War are given.
which show that his instructions were
to use his troops simply for the preser
vation of the peace, and his report
shows that he complied strictly with
i that piled str
his orders. According to General Mer
riam. about 700 arrests were made, but
only 528 were detained after the first
investigation. Of these three died, two
of disease and one suicide.

The word "independence" will not ap

When such government is established
the American troops will be withdrawn
and the Cubans will be left to govern
themselves. As soon as the census is ac
complished local elections wilL be con

civil Etovernment will be established,

what they can do in the way of governing
themselves.

limit of American occupation, but the
proclamation will show that the Cubans
will be permitted to govern themselves
as promptly as they prove themselves

SANTA FE FORCED TO
LOWER ITS RATES
Has Quoted a Single Fare for the
Excursion Prom El Paso
to San Francisco..
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26.â The Santa Fe
has been compelled to meet the m" of
the Southern Paciflc, and as an offset to
the latter company's one-fare rate from
El Paso to San Francisco for the businesa
men's excursion during September the
Santa Fe Paciflc has made practically a
similar tow rate to the same city from
all stations west of Albuquerque. These
tickets are good on September 'J and for
thirty days thereafter.
The rates quoted for this 'special occa
sion "by the Southern Paciflc, as well as
the Santa Fe. are but a trifle more than
the single fare rates from the several
points affected into Los Angeles.
The Santa Fe road is said to have been
averse to entering into the scheme of San
Francisco excursion, and only made the
low rates after the Southern Pacific Com
pany had done so to protect its own ter
ritory.

GIGANTIC OCTOPUS
AND SUNFISH FIGHT
Novel Battle WitQessed by toe
Crew of the BarK
Willscott.
VICTORIA, B. CL, Aug. 26.â Captain Peabody of the bark Willi
tells of seeing a gigantic octopus which fought with, vanquished and
feasted upon a mammoth sunfish about 8000 pounds in weight in the blue
Pacific some hundreds of miles out from San Francisco, in the sailing
course of vessels bound from Honolulu to Nanaimo.
In his entry in his log in relation to the deep-sea monster, he says:
"In latitude 30:30 north, longitude UM west, my attention was called by
the quartermaster, Frank Bostock of San Diego, to a terrible commo
tion in the water about three points forward of the lee beam. Our
first thought was that it must be breakers on an uncharted reef, but
while we were watching the breaking of the water ceased. Then we
distinctly saw the outline of two objects on the surface, one much larger
than the other. We at once got our telescopes to bear on them and dis
covered the smaller of the two was a very large sunfish curiously
shaped teh, all head and no body, having no tall but an topper and
lower fin, with which it propels itself about in a very lazy fashion. It
appeared to be fully twelve feet in diameter, and judging from small
er ones we have caught, it must have weighed 3000 pounds. It appeared
to be endeavoring to keep its face to its adversary, which turned out
to be a huge octopus, the length of whose body was certainly forty feet
and the breadth about twenty-five feet, with eight tentacles.
"The ship approached the objects, which remained stationary, re
garding each other curiously for five minutes. Suddenly the octopus
discharged a huge stream of colored fluid full in the face of the sun
fish, then rushing, It encircled it with its tentacles, and both disap

VICTORIA. Aug. 26.â The demands of
Lhe United States Government for steam
ers for transport service is being most
severely felt by exporters who are doing
business with China and Japan. The fleet,
crippled by the Government demands,
:annot carry anything like the amount of
freight that is offered and it Is beginning
to pile up at Sound and British Colum
bia Dorts. There is a bij? freight blockade.

the three Japanese â -âwere in serv
ice all were filled on each outward trip,
and at times more freight was offered
than could be carried. Now the Athenian

and Tartar have become transports, both
being now on their way to the Philip
pines; the Arizona, the biggest of the
Northern Pacitic fleet, has for some time
been a troopship; the Victoria has been
-
impressed, and now comes the news that
three other vessels of the Northern Pacific
line have been taken, leaving the line "out
one steamer, the Olympia, to do the busi
ness, which has grown to such proportions
that the six vessels were taxed to their
utmost.
The last vessel to be chartered is the

will be turned over to the United States

In the abdomen from a 44-caliher pistol of
the bulldog type and are now at the
Morgue. When Tanner commenced firing
Brown and the woman retreated toward
the back porch, where they both fell.
Neither of them spoke after being shot.
Mrs. Barnes died almost Immediately
and Brown gasped his last a few minutes
alter. Both were fully dressed and had
come in from the eKreet, and were pre
paring to go out to supper.
The dead woman was 38 years of age
and not at ail prepossessing, and Brown's
friends cannot imagine why he "took
up" with her. It Is said that she has a
husband living in this city named Pau
son and also a son, who works in the
Emporium. Pawson left her in Philadel
phia some years ago and she followed
him out here, but he would have nothing
to do with her. She "took up" with
Brown, who is divorced from his wife.
Brown has a daughter 17 years of age.
He has three brothers, William, Patrick
and Joseph Brown, all stevedores.
The stories of the terrible crime differ
as to who was the aggressor in tha
tragedy. According to Tanner, who made
a statement immediately after the occur
rence, it appears that he had met Brown
on Kearny street, near Broadway, at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon and after a
few words Brown punched Tanner in the
mouth and threatened to kill him. Tan
ner left and returned to the lodging
house and there began to quarrel with
Mrs. Barnes. The woman then left the
house and sought out Brown, telling him
that Tanner had struck her. Brown re
turned with the woman and according to
Tanner's version this is what occurred:
"Brown came to my room," said Tan
ner, "and knocking on the door said:
" 'Come out, you , and I will do you
up.'
"I went to the door, opened it and he
grabbed me by the throat, at the same
time saying that he was going to kill
me. I struggled with him and he threw
me on the floor. All this time Mrs. Barnes
was striking me in the face, and when
I was down, thinking that I was going to
be killed, in the excitement I pulled mv
pistol out of my pocket and shot four
times. I did not intend to kill anybody,
but I had to defend myself. I am sorry
it occurred, but it had to be done."
The story of Louis Mille, the proprietor
of the lodging-house, which is corrobo
rated by several lodgers in the house,
differs from that of Tanner In that they
all agree that Tanner ordered Brown out
of his 'room with threats to kill him.
The story of Mille Is corroborated in the
main by several boys who live in the
houseâ John Lambert, who rang up the
police, Charles Thurston, John Lambert
and William Aufenanger. They all agree
that Tanner invited Brown to come out
of his room and he would kill him. When
Brown did so the struggle with the fatal
result began. The men rolled over the
hallway and Brown got Tanner up against
the door of another room with his hands
tightly clutching his throat. When they
went to the floor Tanner cried out "let me
up and when Brown released him Tanner
began to shoot and Brown cried out:
"I'm gone. I'm done for."
Brown reeled out toward the back
porch, and Mrs. Barnes, who by that time
appeared upon the scene, began to scream,
saying: "He has killed my husband," and
the second bullet sped into her body. She
followed Brown onto the porch, where
they fell and died within two feet of each
other.
Tanner claims that Brown had assaulted
him twice befoie, and he showed a bruise
on the inner part of his lip administered
by Browns fist yesterday afternoon on
Kearny street. When he was In the cell
at the Harbor Station he was asked why
he had committed the deed, and replied:
"I had to. Brown and Mrs. Barnes have
been trying to do me up. but I did not
have the proof until to-day."
When asked what that proof was, Tan
ner said:
"Weil, Mrs. Phillips, who rooms in the
house, told me Â«some time ago that Mrs.
Barnes wanted her to do me up, that is,
to get money away from me. I could not
accuse Mrs. Barnes of this, because Mrs.
Phillips and her husband were up at Lake
Tahoe and only returned to-day. As soon
as they came home I hunted Brown up,
and meeting him on Kearny street this
afternoon I told him about it, and that I
wouldn't let them do me up any more. At
that he began to assault me, and I went
back home."
Tanner Is an Englishman, 57 years of
age, and came to this city in 1874. He fol
lowed the sea for many years and has
been a mate, on several vessels. Some
years ago he went into the saloon business
and opened two places at 108 and 242 Steu

MEN WHO FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF
MANILA BAY HOME ON THE BOSTON
CRUISER BOSTON RETURNS AFTER A LONG STAY AT MANILA. â¢
THERE was no welcome for the
cruiser Boston yesterday. The
vessel that played such an import-
ant part in the battle of Manila
Bay steamed into port and no more
attention was paid to her arrival than
would be given an ordinary merchant
man, save that she was saluted as
she passed up to her anchorage by the
battery on,Alcatraz, and the battleship
lowa.
The Boston left Manila on June 8
and on her way here stopped at Naga
saki, Yokohama and Honolulu. The
run from the latter port was made in
nine days. She came in flying the
homeward bound pennant, which says
she will go out of commission here. On
her decks were sun-browned men who
fought under Dewey in Manila Bay,
others who cruised on her among the
Philippines; some who were on the
Charleston when Guam was captured,
others who were in the fight off San
tiago and a few who made the famous
voyage on the Oregon from San Fran
cisco to Cuba-
Shot and shell poured thick and fast
on the cruiser as she steamed with
Dewey's fleet into Manila Bay and a
few scars show where the fighting
sold out and bought another place on |
Mission street, near East, which he sold
six months ago. Since then he has done :
nothing but spend his money, and accord
ing to his story most of it went on Mrs.

shells got home. One struck the port
side forward, passing through the
hammock netting and piercing the
foremast, and another smashed in a
plate in the stern and the two others
did no material damage. The Bos
ton's own fire destroyed three of her
boats and badly damaged a couple of
others. Since then the cruiser has been
on the drydock at Hongkong and
thoroughly overhauled. All traces of
her fight with the Spanish fleet has
disappeared and the vessel Is now in
first-class order.
There are many relics of the war on
the Boston. In Lieutenant-Command
er Hughes' quarters is a painting of
the Queen Regent of Spain. It is sup
posed to be the work of some Filipino
artist and is a good likeness of the
mother of Alfonso XIII. The ship's
bell came off the Spanish gunboat Don
Antonio de Ulloa (the Boston's was
cracked by a fragment of a shell dur
ing the battle) and a very elaborate
affair it is. too. Almost every man on
the ship has some memento of the
war. Ugly looking daggers, curios,
knives, curved swords and odds and
ends from every island in the group
are stored away in the sailors' diddy
boxes.
The officers of the Boston are: Lieu

lieutenant-commander, W. H. Allen;

On the day of the battle of Manila

Shot Into the Crowd.
Animated by an exalted idea of his own
importance and a liberal load of celebra
tion whisky, an unknown man attempted
to force his way through the. crowd that
H. Allen was on the Oregon during the
battle of Santiago. Lieutenants Slo
cum and Coontz were on the .
Charleston during the taking of
Guam. Ensign Jackson was at
tached to the St. Paul, and Ensign
McCauley was attached to the Brook
lyn before joining the Boston. Assist
ant Surgeon Ward and Paymaster Dv
Bois were formerly with the Bennington.
Chief Engineer Hall was formerly
with the Pensacola and later on the
Petrel. In his report to the
Secretary of the Navy on the '
arsenal at Cavlte, Admiral Dewey
said: "Much credit is due to
Chief Engineer R. T. Hall, U. S. N.,
who has charge of the steam engineer
ing department and has conducted it
with energy and ability." Assistant
Engineer Cone was on the Baltimore
before joining the Boston and Lieuten
ant L. J. Magill received two brevets
for bravery in the Cuban campaign.
Besides her officers the Boston carries
a crew of 211 bluejackets and 28 mar
ines. These men were gathered from
the other ships of the fleet. Nearly all
of them are time-expired men and
have come home to be paid off. .
Of all the men on the cruiser Lieu
tenant Gibson and Passed Assistant
Engineer James were the only men
who saw the battle of Manila Bay
from her decks. The Boston was sixth
in the column and brought up the rear.
Passing in. several shots were fired
from the Spanish batteries and two
shots were sent back from the Boston.
At 5:35 of that memorable May day
morning the battle began and for two
hours the brave men on the cruiser
fought like demons. At 7:35 A. M., in
obedience to a signal the Boston.with
drew and the men had breakfast. At
11:10 A. M., the battle began again and
continued until the Spanish ships were
all either burned, sunk or ~ sheltered
behind the arsenal of Cavite. In his
report to Admiral Dewey, Captain
Wildes said his officers and men bore
themselves with courage and spirit and
it gave him great pleasure to so state.
He also bore testimony to the courage
and resolution of the Spanish fleet,
saying the Spaniards defended their
vessels until all hope was gone.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyright.

PARIS. Aug. 26. â Emile Blanet telegraphs to Petit Bleu that a
report is current in Bonnes that General Mercier has fled to
Jersey.
GENERAL MERCIER, ARCH FOE OF DREYFUS
General Auguste Mercier. the power behind the prosecution of Dreyfus in
the new trial, was the Minister of War during the first trial, and it was
through his alleged perjury, aided by Henry's forgeries, that Dreyfus was found
guilty. He was charged by Zola, in his famous letter of accusation, as being
the "accomplice by weakness of mind of one of the greatest iniquities of the
century." Mercier is 66 years old. He entered the army in 1856, was promoted
to captain in IS6O and since then has risen steadily in the service. He was
made prisoner at Metz in the Franco-Prussian war, took an active part In the
Mexican campaign and has figured prominently In the army for a score of
years. Since 1534 he has been in command of various army corps In France.
To-day's session tore the last shred
of credit from Mercier. but added the
name of Freystmeter to the little roll
of heroes who have rial everything
in the defense of Dreyfus. One needs
ta be in the very midst of the storm of
the passion now raging in France to
appreciate the height of moral cour
age to which Captain Freystmeter has
risen in coming forward to the defense
of the truth against the army chiefs.
They are simply furious the thor
ough exposure, and all blame Maurel
for falling into the trap laid for him
by M. Labori in Thursday's cross-ex
amination, although it is difficult to
see what else Maurel could have done.
After the courtroom had been cleared
and all the public were supposed to be
excluded. General Mercier accosted
Colonel Ida .--*'. In the courtyard and
gave him a piece of his mind, even go
ing to the extent of calling him a block
head. Maurel vainly protested his help-*
--lessness and ----- of ward

MAUREL CONFRONTED
WITH FREYSTMETER
President of the Former Court-Mar-
tial Practically -Convicted
of Perjury.
RENTES, Aug. 26.â When the sixth ses
sion of the third week of the second trial
by court-martial of Captain Alfred Drey
fus of the artillery, on charges of treason
began this morning In the Lycee Alphonse
Bertillon of the anthropometric depart
ment of the Paris Prefecture of Police re
sumed his testimony, interrupted yester
day by the adjournment of the court for
the day. In this case M. Bertillon testi
fied as a handwriting expert and srave
his reasons for believing Dreyfus to be
the author of the famous bordereau, on
which the prosecution mainly depends to
establish the charge again the prisoner.
The comic aspect of M. Bertiilon's per
formance again appealed to the risibilities
of the audience, though the judges paid
close attention to his demonstrations
wni.n were conciuaea at *:<-*' a. m.. the |
witness saying in a declamatory tone': !
"I am convinced the writer of the bor
dereau is the prisoner sitting there."
Dreyfus heard him without flinching and
:'u3 heard him without flinching and
witb an expression of disdain, which he
?howed in a still more noticeable manner
just before the specialist's testimony,
when M. Demange handed him a papor
which M. Bertillon had submitted to the
fudges as convincing proof of the guilt of
the accused. The prisoner perused it for
i few minutes and then handed it back
with a shrug of his shoulders 'and without
ottering a word.
There was a highly declamatic scene to-
There was a nighly declamatlc scene to
ward the end of the session. M. Labori,
eading counsellor the defense, asked to
lave Captain i-reystmeter, one of the
members of the court-martial of 15j4,
which convicted Dreyfus, called in contra
iictlon of the deposition of Colonel
Maurel. the presiding judge on that oc
:asion. who had testified that he read
mly one of the documents out of the se
:ret dossier communicated to the court
martial. The captain, who is a finely
_uilt officer and who has a handsome,
lonest face, amended the platform with
i firm step and fearless air. When he
was to recount what occurred he said his
â¢onviction of the guilt of the prisoner was
formed by the evidence of experts in
landwriting, the deposition of Colonel Dv
Paty de Clam, "and," he continued, "I
nust add. some slight Influence was ex<*>r
:ised over my mind by hearing the secret
lossier read."
The witness was then questioned as to
whether one or more of the documents
were read, and he said all were read. T'ds
was in direct contradiction of Colonel
tfaurel, and M. Labori at once demanded
he confrontation of Captain Freystrr
Â«rith Colonel MaureL The latter mounted
_he stage and presented a miserable oo
ect, his shifting eyes blearing out be
leath heavy eyebrows and looking around
iim with a vicious, hang-dog look.
"How do you explain this?" asked *â *-*-
LaSb ri.
The colonel, at bay. replied savagely:
The colonel, at bay. replied savagely:
"I said I only read one document. I did

This statement called forth an outburst
>f hisses and indignant "Ohs" from the
indlence. which looked upon It as an in
'amous confession. The witness, trem
bling with shame, but evidently deter
nined to fight to the last, threw a fierce
ook of hatred at M. Labori and the audi
:nce as the gendarmes shouted, "Silence
illence." After this the audience listened
spellbound as Captain Freystmeter, In a

â  ally called Colonel Maurel a thorough
liar, and the colonel glared at the captain
ferociously. Captain Freystmeter, how-
ever, was not dismayed, and his words,
spoken b a tone of candor and fearless-
ness, must have carried conviction to
every hearer.
General Mercier then asked to be heard
and placed himself by the side of MaureL
The forbidding appearance of these two
men. both dressed in civilian attire, was
in striking contrast with the erect, on-
.fllnching attitude of Freystmeter, who
wore the smart uniform of a captain of
-.-"..-- with medals on his breast. It
was a remarkable scene.
Major Carriere asked the court to con-
front Colonel Maurel and Captain Freyst-
meter. As Captain Freystmeter, his breast
glittering with decorations, advanced with
firm step and an air of energy he created
a good impression. He wore a short beard
turning gray and a flowing blonde mus
tache. His hair is almost white, though
he is only 42 years old. He deposed, say-
ing:
"I was a Judge of the court-marr i
"I was a Judge of the court-martial of
1534. My belief in the prisoner's guilt was
due to the ev_ieeTi.ce of experts and Colonel
Henry and Major Dv Paty de Clam. I
should say it was strengthened by the
reading of documents which were commu
nicated to us. the judges, in a private
room. (Great sensation.)
'The secret dossier contained: First, a
biographical dossier, imputing to Dreyfus
acts cf treason committed at the Poly-
technic School at Bourges. at the military
college and while on the headquarters
staff. Second, the document known as the
'cette canaille de Dâ ' document. Third,
a letter which, by showing resemblance
of the handwriting, proved the genuine-
ness of the 'cette canaille de D â ' docu
ment, and which was cailed the 'd'Avign-
on letter.' (Cries of "Oh.") Fourth, a tele-
gram from a foreign military attache.
very distinctly asseverating the prisoner's
guilt. (A great sensation and lively inter-
ruptions followed this statement.)
"This telegram, if I remember rightly,"
continued the witness, "was in the follow-
ing terms: 'Dreyfus Is arrested. Emissary
warned.* " Renewed cries of "Oh, oh.")
At this juncture General Mercter and
Colonel Maurel simultaneously ask-; per-
mission to speak. Their action caused
intense excitement, which became breath-
less as Colonel Maurel stood up and both
the former judses confronted each other
with almost defiant looks. Colonel Maurel
said:
'â¢I have only a word to say. The other
day Maitre Labori drew me from the
ground of argument to the ground of se
cret deliberations. I told him I had only
read a single document. These were the
words, 'I only read one document.* I did
not say only one document had been
read. (Sensation.)
"I did not go any further than that.
and did not wish to violate the see- of
the judges' deliberations." Continuing.
Colonel Maurel said: "In reply to ques
tions of counsel for the defense, who woud
have made me say more than I wished,
I declared I had only read one of the
documents. After reading that document I
handed the dossier to the clerk, saying, 1
am tired.' "
This caused a sensation and Interrup
tions, almost developing Into an uproar,
which caused Colonel Jouaust to order the
commandant of gendarmes to maintain
silence.
Colonel Maurel, as he spoke, was great-
ly excited and troubled. The fingers of
his right hand opened and shut nervously,
while those of his left hand kept up a
tattoo on the bar of the witness stand.
Captain Freystmeter steadfastly regard-
ed his former colleague, his cold, deter-
mined attitude having an immense effect
on the audience, whose great agitation in-
creased as exciting incidents follower!.
M. Labori asked whether Colonel Maurel
confirmed the explanations of Captain
Freystmeter and what the latter had said
in regard to Colonel Maurel. The latter
replied: ,
"I answer with all frankness and truth.
"I answer with all frankness and truth.
I only listened to the reading of the doc-
uments very absently. It was not Inter-
esting." (Shouts of "Oh, oh" and much
laughter.) ,__Â»____ -' â "-'--' â ".-â â â 
The witness concluded with saying,
"That is all. Monsieur Ie President. I re-
member nothing else."
Captain Frevstmeter was then request-
ed to definitely give his recollections con-
cerning the production of a secret docu
ment at the court-martial of 1394. His
manner was quiet and collected as he re-
Piled: . _ .. . r Â ; ;

Colonel Maurel, very pale, nervously
protested against the use of the word
"commentary." which caused laughter.
"I could not have acted as Cantain
Freystmeter asserts." said Colonel Mau-
rel "I was too conscious of my duty to
allow myself to influence in any way the-
Judges whose president I was, and if
what Captain Freystmeter has just said

presence, if the president had attempts 1

Addressing -Colonel Jouaust Captain
Freystmeter said:

to make any communication in the

tionary troops, fought the Govern

ing heavy losses. It is reported tliat
the Government force lost 150 men
in killed and injured, and. that the
revolutionists captured two field
pieces. In addition General An

lost only thirteen killed, besides sev
eral wounded.
wh'ch had been awakened in his mind by
Colonel Henry's forgery. He spoke of the
anguish by which his conscience was tor-
ttred. I did not reply to Captain Freyst-
meter, because I am accustomed to allow
every one the liberty of his own opinion-..
In my opinion every one ought to guide
his ship his own way."
M. Labori requested the Judges to not-:
that no contradiction was offered to Cap-
tain Freystmeter's statement that the
Panizzardi telegram of November 2 wa.
communicated privately to the Judges in
IS',H. and under these circumstances Gen-
eral Mercier, having testified that he had
sriven an order that the telegram should
not be communicated, and whereas he nail
also testified that the order was carried
out, counsel begged the president of tha
court to ask General Mercier for an ex-
planation concerning the statement, which
entirely contradicted his evidence. (Great
sensation.)
General Mercier. who had paid rapt at-
tention to what was going on, pointed out
that CaDtain Freystmeter had spoken of
an act of treason alleged to have beer.
described at the 1534 court-martial as hay-
ing been committed by Dreyfus at the
Polytechnic School, adding- that Freyst-
meter seemed to retain very exact recoi
lections of the documents communicated,
and asked what was referred to In the
letter mentioned. Captain Freystmeter:
"It referred to a shell. I see the docu
ment perfectly in my mind's eye."
General Mercierâ So Captain Freystme-
ter is caught* in the very act of lying.
(Loud protests.)
**I repeat it," the general said, coolly.
' Â£ repeat it," the general said, coolly.
amid renewed protests. "As a matter of
fact the Robin shell to which he refers
was only made in Germany in IS!*.. We
were informed of the act of treason in
ISM."
Captain Freystmeter adhered to his
statement that a shell was mentioned In
the commentary submitted to the generate
in 1594.
General Mercierâ As for the telegram of
General Mercierâ As for the telegram of
November 2. I maintain that it was not
communicated to the court of 1534.
Captain Freystmeterâ l am certain that
there was a telegram with the words
"Dreyfus is arrested. Emissary warned."
There was something else, which I do not
remember. As regards the reply General
Mercier has just made to me, I insist I
have not said that there was a document
mentioning particular shells, but simply
a commentary referring to an act of
treason in connection with a shell. I do
not know if that affected the evidence <_f
the prosecution. But I only testified to
that of which I am strictly certain.
General Mercier reiterated that it was
impossible to communicate in 1534 con-
cerning the Robin shell. M. Labori then
said:
"In view of the Incidents occurring, I
must insist once more Monsieur le Presi-
dent, that the condition of Colonel Dv
Paty de Clam -be examined into by im-
partial physicians. General Mercier has
stated that the packet containing the se
cret documents was prepared by Colonel
Dv Patv de Clam."
General Mercier interrupted: "Pardon
me, I said I had learned from General
de ' Boisdeffre that the package was
brought by Colonel Dv Paty de Clam. But
I also said Colonel Sandherr prepared the
package." (Sensation.)
M. Laboriâ Always tbe dead' Sandherr
the dead. Henry the dead. Their testi
mony is constantly being cited.
Colonel Jouaust protested against these
words as being out of order, and M. La-
bori resumed his seat in silence.
This incident, which terminated the cvi-
dence of Captain Freystmeter, caused an
immense impression on the audience. The
Dreyfusards were jubilant.
M. Paref-Joufal, a draughtsman, was
called for the defense. He was accompa
nied by a blackboard, upon which he pro-
posed to refute a portion of M. Bertillon's
problems. The witness said, amid laugh-
ter, that the demonstration would occupy
no less than two hours. He then pro
ceeded to chalk a number of calligraphic
signs on the blackboard, and presented to
the court photographs of the writing of
the bordereau and the prisoner's hand-
writing, pointing out their dissimilarities
and entering into elaborate explanations,
which were not conclude.! when, at 11:50
a. m., the court adjourned.

murderous scheme to the trio. They
readily consented to undertake the job.
and it was agreed that they should
knock him senseless with some blunt
Instrument and then throw him over
board.
They were to receive $20,000 if they
succeeded in doing away with Green.
The men, according to their plans,
boarded the steamer, but made no at
tempt to molest the millionaire. Sev
eral weeks later Casey and Kelly re
turned to this citj'. and after Informing
Howard that they had murdered Green,
demanded the balance of the $20,000 he
had promised them. They represented
that Murphy had gone direct to Aus

pected and thrown in jail. Howard.
evidently satisfied that his murderous
scheme had been carried out, gladly
paid over the money to his hired thugs.
He did not know that at the -dm

the men whom he trusted had given
him what in sporting parlance is
known as the "double cross." After di
viding the "blood" money they had re
ceived from Howard. Casey and Kelly
proceeded to have a good time. They
bought champagne galore and lived
at the most expensive restaurants in
the city.
When the expose came revealing the
true character of Howard the men sud
denly disappeared.- and it was first
thought they had left the city. Tester
ady. however, the detectives learned
that Casey had returned to his haunts
and they set about to arrest him. They
are hopeful of apprehending Kelly ln a
few days.

You will marry once and live happily.
You will have one child, and will travel
quite extensively.
MRS. P. B. L.. San Joseâ Your hus
band's violent death was s.o great a shock
that it has undermined your health. You
are too much Inclined to retrospection and
melancholy. Try to be more cheerful.
There Is happiness for you yet if you
will make it yours.
FREDA CLARKE, Cityâ You have
lived â  reckless and adventurous life and
are too indifferent to public opinion. You
are good-hearted, but Inclined to be care
less of the feelings of others.
MISS (_. E. A. âYou have a great deal
of courage and energy. You are practi
cal and sensible and will marry well. You
will travel and find life as a general thing
pleasant.
MRS. P. M.â Yours is a -hand expressing
more sense than sentiment. Your cher
ished hopes have not been realized. A
great sorrow has left Its Impression upon
your mind. You will travel much.
PAULINE V., Cloverdaleâ Y'ou will suc
ceed In music if you have mire money to
cultivate your talent: but financial con
ditions Interfere with your progress.
There is a piece of good fortune for you
In the future.
MISS E. M. G., Fifteenth streetâ You
will have to take care not to overtax
your brain. Your lines all show that
whatever Illness you suffer would par
ticularly affect the brain. You will marry,
but It would be as well if you did not.
P. L. L., 1029 Market streetâ You would
make a good pawnbroker.- Your sympa
thies will never overpower your prudence.
You are somewhat too penurious. You
have had serious domestic trouble.
ROSCOE LA PLAA-Ybur hand shows
some ability, but you lack originality.
You are sensitive to a fault. You will not
marry until late in life, and then not as
happily as you could wish.
LOLITA 8.. San JoseâYou will excel in
your art If you do not allow your interest
in the opposite sex to absorb too much
time. You will marry at 26.
MRS. A. 1. M.â This is a good motherly
hand, true in affection. There Is only one
marriage to be seen in It. You are affec
tionate, but not sentimental, and had
many financial trials ln early life and one
great sorrow.
EVA DALE. Stocktonâ You are some
what flirtatious and foolish at times, and
your love of admiration will lead you into
some difficulties. You are too easily in
fluenced and should choose friends care
fully. You will not marry until after 30,
but will take a long journey at 2S.
STAR LIGHT, This hand lacks
force and shows too much sentiment. You
are fond of forms and ceremonies iind the
beauties of art and nature. , You are in
clined to be blind and fearful about your
future, but you. have no real reason to be
so. You must take good care of your
health between the apes of 2S and 29.
"LADY* MARTIESE," San Joseâ
palm does not Indicate a. very strong or
determined nature: on the contrary, Tt Is
somewhat too sensitive and too fond of
expressions. You have some dramatic
and elocutionary ability, but an early
heart affair will take your attention from
serious and earnest study. You will have
much happiness. â¢â¢'.-:
MISS F. M. A. G:â You will marry, but
not until you have had your full share
of disappointments. You are so broad
minded and practical that the average
man of. your, acquaintance simply annoys
yoy. but the right one will come after a
while.
MISS F. F. V.â are rather too
changeable to make the most of your life.
You will be happy in your married life
and see a good deal of the world and
have two children. Cultivate repose of
manner and stnhilitv of character.
LADY' ELEANOR R.. San Joseâ The
owner of this hand will experience many
changes in life, will marry twice â once
early In life. You are capable of making
a success in life. Independent of matri
mony, for you are resourceful and have
much latent energy.
MR. H. L., Golden Gate avenueâ This is
the hand of an honest, phlegmatic Indi
vidual, who can talk weil but ddes not
carry out plans with as much force as
would be desirable. An accident Is threat
ened at 45, but can he avoided with proper
care. . .

Coupon That Won the Prize.
MRS. MARY L. DAY of San Lorenzo, Cal., has won The Sunday Call
prize guessing contest as to when the transport Sherman would
be sighted. Tfce ladies of California always have been good
guessers, but Mrs. Day has proved herself a wonder, for she called the
time within forty-four seconds. .
Mrs. Day stated the time of arrival as 5 o'clock 42 minutes and 16
seconds p. m. of August 23. The transport was sighted at Point Lobos
by John Hyslop, the official marine observer for the Merchants' Ex-
change, at exactly 5:43 p. m. of August 23.
Mrs. Day will be well repaid for her lucky guess and the small
amount of time required in preparing and mailing her coupon, for she
will receive $50 in bright, shining gold for herself, besides the credit
of donating $50 to the general fund of the entertainment committee for
our brave Californians just returned.
Thousands upon thousands of coupons have been overwhelming
The Call Coupon Editor for the past week. Every one felt that they
would like to have a chance to express an opinion upon the question
which has been paramount in the minds of â when would the boys ar-
rive? The ship reached port so much sooner than the majority of peo-
ple anticipated that of course the greater, number of guessers missed the
mark by a day or so. Still, there were many who made most remarkably
close estimates.
The following show as fine calculation as the oldest sea captain
could expect:
Miss K.I. Burns, 640 Oak street, city, 5:45; Louis Kreiger, 230
Sixth street, city, 5:45:08; C. Hadle,* 7o7 Market street, city, 5:45:10;
John Peters, 23 Eureka street, city. 5:45:11; Mrs. H. W. Macdonald,
1313 Twelfth avenue. East Oakland, 5:45:20; Mary Johnston, 507 An-
dover avenue, 5:45:32; Mrs. E. Finley, 620 Octavia street, city, 5:45:30;
Margaret Marks, 814 California street, 5:45:30; A. H. Bayless, 75 Chron-
icle building, 5:45:30; Edwin Kendall, 635 Mission street, 5:45:40; H. E.
Christin, San Jose, Cal., 5:45:45; F. W. Davenport, Marysville, Cal.,
5:45:45 â all, of course, dated August 23, and p. m.
Mr. Hyslop, the marine observer for the Merchants' Exchange,
considers the time of sighting as most remarkable. He says it is not
once in a hundred times that a vessel is sighted exactly on the minuto.

BpeÂ«al Dispatch to The Call.
READVTLDE, Mass., Aug. * 26. âThe
Grand Circuit meeting at the Readvllle
track closed to-day with splendid victories
by The Abbott In the free for all trot and
Anaconda in the 2:04 pace. The after
noon's sport was marred by the laying up
of Volo Maid In the 2:25 trot and her dis
qualification, together with her driver.
Ben Demarest, both of whom are barred
from the track for a year.
In the first heat Volo Maid went out
from the bunch and had a commanding
lead until the turn, when she seemed to
drop back suddenly and Cello jumped
ahead, with Paul Pry coming up strong.

Improper food is responsible for
many ailments of humanity.
When one finds a sickness Impending
it is safer to make a radical change in
the food than to go to self-drugging.
Your physician would tell you that
is true.
There are times when one needs the
advice and care of a physician, but for |
plight disorders the surest and safest
way Is to change the food completely, j
Try, for example, for ten days the j
following breakfast: A little fruit,
(little if any sugar), a dish of Grape- j
Nuts (a famous breakfast food) ahd !
cream, a cup of Postum Cereal Food j
Coffee and nothing more. Our word for j
it, you will feel a distinct gain in
health and strength much as if â¢ the j
whole body had been washed clean and
put in first-class order. It is certainly
worth a trial if active good health is
worth anything. â /-'', â :':,
The finish was sensational, for Paul Pry I
made a great burst of speed, but unfor- I

ting a setting back. Cello taking the heat. !
The Judges did not like the driving of j
Volo Maid and substituted McHenry for
Ben Demarest. The change was a good
one, for Volo Maid stepped, a great sec-
ond heat, Paul Pry again being set back
for running, although finishing two
lengths ahead of Volo Maid.
The horses were given a wretched start
for the third heat, and while Volo Maid
led most of the distance Fleetwood and
Hope came up strong. Fleetwood won by
a short neck.
In the fourth and deciding heat Fleet-
wood led from the start, but Volo Maid
gave him a fine race, probably losing the
race by a break near the wire.
The four horses In the free-for-all were
sent away on the first heat in good shape,
Eagle Flanagan having the pole. John
Nolan pulled away and led to the quarter,
followed by Kentucky Union and Blngen.
On the backstretch Blngen jumped Into |
the lead, followed by The Abbott, and the
two had a grand fight to the finish.
The Abbott caught the Forbes horse at
the three-quarters pole. Blngen seemed
winded and Eagle Flanagan nearly caught
him, while The Abbott finished a length
ahead, going easy. - The second and decid-
ing heat was almost a repetition of the
first, except that The Abbott showed a
' still greater burst of speed at the finish
and Bingen was lifted off his feet at the
wire.
The great pacers, Searchlight, Anaconda,
Roan Wilkes and Bessie Bonehill, came
out for the 2:04 pace. The start of the
first heat was seemingly a poor one, for
Bonehill, having the pole, was two lengths
behind. Her driver nodded for the word
! and the horses were sent away. Roan
.Wilkes took the pule at once and left
Searchlight at the quarter, with Anaconda
' light up. The horses were close at the
half. Searchlight being almost even with
Wilkes. At the three-quarters Wilkes,

At last the Dudes have found their
measure. At least that ls what the soft
ppoken Brummellans of the Athenic city
spoken Brummellans of the Athenlc city
call it. In other words, they have won
i game by fast work, due to an instillation
of gingery, patriotic spirit attendant up- j
on the homecoming of the soldiers. It was
the work of a single inning, a combination
of errors and hits, that did it all. At the
end of the run-getting spasm Oakland
mustered up seven tallies, and the fried
Crabs were wallowing ln a stagnant pond
of fulsome errors.
Both teams made a good flying start,
but the finish was poor. Two Innings
passed with but a single hit and no runs.
Then Santa Cruz let out a reef and did
something. Dalrymple hit to Schmeer, [
who threw wild to first, and Dal was safe
on the bag. Dike a thief in the night, he
appropriated the second bag, and scored
on Williams' double.
The Dudes were then given a turn at the
wheel, and the fireworks display they pre
sented to the crowd was of the First Cali
fornia reception order. Four balls were
used up in the controversial labors of the
Dudes to make amends for past apathetic
conduct. Stcffanl, Hutchinson and Ham
mond, occupying the bags on honest hits.
were pulled around to the rubber on a
three-bagger by Hardie. After this a se
ries of hits and errors forced Hardie, Dun
leavy, Schmeer and Dean across the plate,
and the scorer worked his arm sore by
ringing seven times. In the fifth the Dudes
added a couple more tallies to the score,
and one each in the seventh and eighth.
The Crabs were fed with a single bit*
in the seventh, and in the eighth they ate
a Dude or two. Dalrymple was hit on the
calf my Michael Angelo ""Steffani In the
seventh inning, and his base be took. Sec
ond was his on a passed ball, and a wild
throw gave him third. A hit by Williams
to Dunleavy forced Dalrymple over the
plate. In the eighth Pace and Streib
scored when Drennan worked a two-bag
ger to center.
Balsz was an easy mark for the Dudes,
SENATOR HANSBROUGH,
and the error column will tell the rest.

did very good work and were steady

Market Inspector Gans swore to a com
plaint ln Judge Conlan's court yesterday
for the arrest of "John Doe" Anzini, a
butcher at Sixth and Natoma streets, on
a charge of forgery for altering a public
document.
August 9 Gans seized two calves in An*

them on the form prescribed by the Board
of Health. Two days later Philip Deller
sold Anzini three calves. Anzini told him
to call back in an hour and he would pay
him fo rthe calves. When Deller returned
Anzini said that the market inspector had
called and seized the calves, showing him
the receipt, which had been altered from
August 9 to August 11, and from two to
three calves.
Deller knew that the calves he sold were
good, and a few days ago happened to
speak to the market Inspector about seiz
ing them, and the alteration of the re

Order Eastern Star.
Last Tuesday night Ivy Chapter re
ceived an official visit from Worthy Grand
Matron Mrs. Maria Akers Pierce in Its
hall in the Gold, Gate Asylum, which for
the occasion was very prettily decorated.
The decoration* of the east were princi
pally American flags draped on each side
of a panel of scarlet set with silver stars.
Above biased the emblematic star. The
central star was also the object of the
decorator's art. Over it was a great bell*
of ferns and ivy, while from it streamed
garlands which were attached to poles set
at each point and twined with ribbon of
the color of the point. The walls were
draped with yellow and pale pink orna
mented with silver tinsel. The effect was
quite striking. Five were added â¢â  to the
membership by Initiation. These were:
Eugene Graves. Mrs. Olive Pierce, Mrs.
Caroline Robinson. Mrs. Minerva Mar
ston and Michael Silva, and the work was
done by the officers In such a perfect
manner that the grand matron announced
that the officers of this chapter would be
selected to exemplify the work before the
next Grand Chapter, In her address, In
which she reviewed the work of the chap
ter, the worthy grand matron took occa
sion to compliment all the officers for th*
ritualistic work, and particularly those
who represent the five points of the star.
There were present, in addition to the
visiting official, Associate Grand Patron
George Louis Darling, Right Worthy
Grand Ruth Mrs. Augusta Dunn Wilson,
Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Partridge, P. M. W.

Eleanor Marie Owens, Mary Beakes
Moore; Past Grand Treasurers Mrs. Isi
dora Horton and Mrs. A. S. Hubbard;
Mrs. Hattie A. Whitaker of Gait Chapter
and the matrons of nearly all the local
chapters. Dr. James Morsell Gassaway,
the worthy patron, in a very well worded
speech presented the worthy grand ma
tron on behalf of the chapter a bunch of
sweet flowers, and then Mrs. Lydia Ann
Steele, the worthy matron, also on behalf
of the chapter, presented Mrs. Pierce a
tiny gem of a parlor clock. The evening
closed with a banquet partaken of by
nearly 250 people. Aivina Huer Wilson,
who during the initiatory ceremony fur
nished the music, stood under a canopy
of American flags and sang "The Star-
Spangled Banner," the banqueters rising
and joining in the chorus.

The reception that was given to Grand

that will be long remembered with pleas
ure by the Odd Fellows of that city.
It was the first visit of the grand
master to that part of the State.
He and the deputy were greeted
by nearly 300 members of the craft, Can
ton 1 turning out more than thirty strong
and the Veteran Association coming in
with about forty members. The lodges of
the city were well represented. For the
purpose of exemplifying the work of the
order the sitting lodge conferred the
second degree in a manner that won the
commendation of the visiting officials and
other visitors. After the work of the even

instructive addresses.

among the most active men in that branch

announced by Loyal Rebekah Lodge for
Its "straw social" last Monday night, and
there were as many people in Welcome
hall, 1. O. O. F. building, as could enter
to discover what the surprise would be
and where the laugh would come in. The
ian was tastefully decorated with anci
tui arrangements of straw tied with rib
bons of the color of the order, and there
was for tach one present a souvenir in
tne nature of a bunch of wheat for each

last Friday by the members of Redwood

The Native Sons.
During the past week the Native Sons
of this city and Oakland were, all busy
Preparing for the parade of last night
and had but little time to attend to other
business. Among those who were very
active were Frank H. Mills of Mission
Parlor, who was the promoter in that par
lor of the Idea that suggested the mag
Â£atest fraternal If ews.
niflcent ovation to the boys from Califor
nia who came back, and who in recogni
tion of his suggestion in the matter was
made the president of the joint commit
tee of the Native Sons' and Native Daugh
ters' committee. Another who is deserv
ing of special mention is Alfred L. Mor
ganstern, past president of Halcyon Par
lor of Alameda, who held the .responsible
position of chief aid to Grand Marshal
PJstolesl of Sequoia Parlor, who himself
proved an Indefatigable worker. Mr.
Morgenstern came over from his Ala
meda home at 9 o'clock every morning
and remained on duty until lt was time
to catch the last boat. He did much hard
work, and for this his only reward was
the satisfaction that he had worked zeal
ously in a good cause. J. W. Lewis of
Stanford Parlor. L. F. Byington of Niantic
Parlor and J. M. Carroll were' also earnest
workers. Another who, though not a Na
tive Son. did much to direct the work that
was necessary at headquarters in the ar
ranging of all the preliminaries for the
perade. was Harry I. Fisher, the secre
tary. He is a man who has had a great
deal of experience in the matter of laying
out such work, and it came in well during
the time that the plans had to be pre
pared. For a week, during the illness of
the grand marshal, a great deal of the
heaviest preliminary work devolved upon
him.

A new parlor to be known as San An
dreas will be instituted at San ondreas

ing organized this parlor.

Native Daughters' Home.
The members of Orlnda Parlor. Native
Daughters of the Golden West, have in
augurated a plan of assistance to the
Native Daughters' Home which will result
In great good to it. It Ir to give a social
once a month, invite to it one of the
other local parlors, and ask that parlor
to "bring something for the home." What
that something is to be will be set forth
in the Invitation. The first of these was
given last week, and the parlor invited
was Calaveras. It was designated as a
"soap social," or, in other words, the
price of admission was a piece or any
number of pieces of soapâ any kind that
could be useful in the home. The result
was a very satisfactory one, for there
was a generous contribution of soap.
The linen party thai was recently given
by Oro Fino parlor In aid of the home
resulted in a liberal donation of useful
linen articles for the home.
Joaquin Parlor of Stockton has voted
$50 to the support of the home.
During the past week the following
named were guests at the home: Miss S.
F. Connlff, Miss Cora J. Martin. Miss Ma

THE SAN FE AN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, 1899.
I attend what the committee of arrange-
ments anticipates will be one of the most
i enjoyable functions ever given by this
lodge.
Knights of Honor.
The arrangements for the Knights of
Honor excursion to Los Gatos on the Dth
of September are all completed. The
i trains that are to convey the excursionists
there will be decorated with the emblems
! and the colors of the order. Each lodge
will have one or two cars for its members
I their families and friends. A number of
| valuable prizes will be distributed and

: grand barbecue for the visitors.
A new lodge has been instituted at Sa-
I linas, with forty-two charier members,
1 by Grand Dictator P. L. Archibald, E. F.
| Joy, past grand dictator, Thomas John-
stone grand reporter, and W. Stathan.
On the night of the ISth inst. the lodge
i in Monterey gave an anniversary enter
' tainment, that was attended by a very
I large number of people. After a pleas-
I ing menu there was a banquet. Dur-
ing the evening Rev. James Snodgrass de-
I livered an interesting address on fraternal
societies of the beneficiary character, such
as the Knights of Honor. He said that
a number of the clergy of almost every
denomination decried such orders and that
was because they had not given the mat-
ter the careful thought that would en-
able them to judge rightly of them; but
that of late years many ministers had
solved the problem for themselves and
having discovered the good there is in
them, the opposition year by year is
growing less.
Knights of Pythias.
The local lodges of the Knights of
Pythias are making arrangements to give
monthly or semi-monthly entertainments,
under the auspices of the membership, to
friends and to those who may feel an in-
terest in knowing what the order of
Knights of Pythias is. '-. _v
The members of Selby Lodge at Crock-
ett, Contra Costa County, propose to give
an entertainment on the night of the 2d of
September at which the play of "Damon
and Pythias" will be presented.
California Lodge on the night of the llth
inst. had a most enjoyable smoker in its
hall. Henry Beaver presided, and there
was an enjoyable programme of mv-
sic, speeches and songs. The principal
speaker of the evening was Henry Schaff-
ncr, great keeper of records and seals.
Sons of Exempts.
The Sons of Exempt Firemen at the
meeting held last Monday night re-elected
L. S. Graves president, A. McFarland sec-
retary and all the Incumbents to serve an-
other term, in recognition of the faithful-
ness with which they discharged the
duties of their respective offices during
I the term preceding the current one. The.
society ls growing, and when it becomes
better known and the sons of exempt
i firemen realize that this association will
i ln a short time become the successors of
! the. old Exempts and become the custo
! dians of the archives and relics of the
parent organization they will seek mem
! bership and be proud of belonging to a
society that has for its purpose the keep
. Ing alive of the memories of their fathers
i.i their achievements in the early days
of San Francisco.
Friends of the Forest.
The first of a series of At Homes to be

THE X-RAY
Exposes a Fraudulent So-Called Per-
petual-Motion Machine.
Through the use of an X-ray another
so-called perpetual motion machine has
been exposed. It was the invention of J.
M. Aldrich. now a convict ln Auburn
prison, who had succeeded in interesting
a number of capitalists In his contrivance.
They advanced th.' money to perfect the
machine, which Aldrich spent without
apparent result, and he finally brought up
In Jail as a fraud. X*'y:X :rx
His machine fell into the hands of the
i Scientific American. It was not a cumber
' some affair, but small enough to fit into a
bandbox. After looking it over from the
outside the experts decided that it was
one of the cleverest frauds that ever
drew money from the pockets of the
guileless. It was apparently all that the
Inventor claimed it to be. No concealed
devices could be found. The experts did
not care to destroy the machine, and
, while studying out the best way to solve
the problem the X-ray scheme was sug
gested.
The works were Incased In a wooden
j box. This was put under the X-ray,
which revealed the silhouette of an ordi
i nary set of clockwork. The gears were
' connected with the main shaft of the
motor by means of a small rod, extend
-1 ing through one of the posts, two bevel
Wheel! In" the top of the post serving to
! transmit the motion of the clockwork to
a revolving shaft and weights.
The works, which were inserted in a
: hollowed out base of the machine, were
cleverly concealed. The whole thing was
put together with artistic clumsiness.
The keyholes by which the clockwork was
reached were not of suspicious appear-
ance, having been made to resemble
wormholes.â New York Evening World.
He Wasn't Joking^^^^^J
"I had four days' growth of beard on
mv face when 1 struck -a little town in
Northern Michigan," said a civil engineer.
"I found a little coop of a barber shop
near the depot, and I entered it to dis
cover the barber sitting on a bench with
his head In his hands. As he roused up I
told him to get to. work on me, but after
looking me over he replied:
'If I shave you you'll have to take
the chances.'
" 'What chances?' I asked.
"'Well. I've been on a drunk for the
last week, and am just on â¢ the point of
seeing rats. I may get through with lt
all right and I may cut your head off.
"The man had a wild look and was all
a-tremble," continued the engineer, "and,
though he smiled as he talked, I saw that
he wasn't joking. I went away without
getting shaved and for the next two hours
was busy making purchases. As I re
turned to the depot I looked In on the
barber to see how he got along and found
him hanging dead. Just what would have
happened had he started to shave me I
don t know, but I've always felt much
obliged to the man for putting the case
as plainly as he Chicago News.

Odd Ways.
Odd Ways.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Aug. 26.
Mrs. Mary Leilah Kirkham Yarde-Bul
ler, better known as Lady Yarde-Buller,
whose career and eccentricities have fur
nished columns of sensational material
for the newspapers, did not respond in
person to the citation ordering her to ap
pear before Judge Hall to-day to show
cause why W. B. Greenebaum should not
be appointed guardian of her person and
Income. Once the brilliant daughter of
the late General Kirkham. her fondness
for the cup that intoxicates has so com
pletely wrecked her mentally and phys
ically that she has become utterly in
competent to realize the value of money
and has been squandering her Income like
a. mere child.
A Mon Chateau, the well known road-
Bide resort In Piedmont, has of late
months been her domicile. Those who
have been thrown In contact with her
during her sojourn at the chateau testified
in court this morning to corroborate the
allegations of her incompetency as set
forth in Mr. Greenebaum's petition. Th^re
were those who went to the extent of as
serting that her recklessness in the
squandering of the wealth was not barred
at actually throwing money Into the
streets. 'â â¢â¢< - y>
While her actual income ls now only
about $400 monthly she has been spending
$200 in excess of this. She does not realize
that her Income is not as large as ln
years gone by and before her properties
became Incumbered with mortgages. Fre
quently she still talks about her large es
tates, when as a matter of fact her entire
property outside of Alameda County com
prises an interest in a house and six acres
in England, from which she derives her
present income. . ** :
Mr. Greenebaum tetlfied that the lady
had told him "to go ahead and secure let
ters of guardianship," since "her friend
knew best."
The .ady's two sons, Arthur .and Ralph
Blair, Aged 19 and 22 years respective^*,
also testified to their "mother's incompe
tence, and both signified their willingness
to have Greenebaum appointed her guard
lan. Ralph Blair said that his mother
now frequently signs checks on the Bank
of England for large amounts, but these
are promptly returned.
Dr. L. H. Le Gault testified that he had
been treating the lady for some time past
and that he considered her very 111. .Â« *-,
According to Dr. Jeremiah Maher. an
other expert, the lady "talks of anything
nnd everything under the sun and be
comes violent at times." When asked
whether her Ladyship is addicted to the
use of Intoxicants witness replied: "Yes.
Kir; all the time. And her disposition is
to get liquor every time she can."'
There were numerous other witnesses.
among them A. R. Peters who told of
the lady having on* sent him to San
Francisco to collect rents for the half
block of buildings back of the Palace Ho
tel, but he found she owned no such
propertj*.
it developed that Lady Yarde-Buller
had asked for Mr. ilreenebaum's appoint
ment during a lucid moment and Judge
Hall aecordinglj- granted the latter' peti
tion, fixing the guardian's bond at $10,000.
Lady Yarde-Buller began her career as
the petted daughter of wealth â â â .'.>] fash-
in. Her father, the late General Kirk
ham, at one time commandant of the
Presidio, had accumulated vast wealth
and his money was always at the com
mand of his daughter's fads and foibles.
In her younger days, endowed with rare
beauty and a self-asserted desire to lead,
she- shone resplendent! j- in the soeietj
circle wherein "she reigned apparently by
some strange inlluence. She went to
Paris to complete the polish of her ac

she fell in love with a young Englishman.

FELL DOWN A SHAFT.
Now Miner Fred Hartz Seeks
Damages.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 2b.
Suit for the recovery of 920,550 damages
was filed in the Superior Court late this
afternoon by Fred Hartz against the
Mount Jefferson Gold Mining and Devel
opment Company of Maine, which Is car
rying on business and operating a mine
at Groveland, In this State.
Damages are sought for personal in
juries sustained by Hartz on April 15, 1599.
at which time he was employed as an un
derground miner in the Mount Jefferson
mine at Groveland. It appears from the
allegations In the complaint drawn up by
Attorneys W. J. Donovan and F. E. Wood
that Hartz on the day named gave the
signal to the engineer of the mine direct
ing him to lower a car or skip with the
plaintiff therein to the bottom of the mine
from the three hundred foot level; that
instead the engineer raised the car by
reason of not having received the signal
properly on account of the bell cord and
appliances connected therewith being de
fective. In this connection the complaint
sets forth:
That said engineer for the reason aforesaid
and failing to comprehend the signal, raised
the car instead of lowering the same from the
300-foot level toward the top of the mine, there
by causing the car to jump off of and leave the
tracks; that at the same time said tracks
were Imperfectly constructed and were danger
ous and unsafe. * * * And plaintiff was pre
cipitated from the car and fell to the bottom
of the mine, a distance of 125 feet, * * â¢ and
thereby crushed and received great bodily in
jury; had his head injured, the right side being
cut open by the fall; his right shoulder frac
tured; his left knee badly twisted, and plain
tiff was thereby permanently injured and re
ceived a great nervous shock.
By reason of being confined to his bed
and detained from following his occupa
tion as a miner defendant claims damages
In the sum of $300; for medical attendance
$230 and for permanent Injuries $20,000.
ADDITIONAL CONTEST
OVER BAUERLE ESTATE
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â addition to the
sensational suit commenced last Thurs
daj- by Public Administrator B. C. Hawes
against Adolph H. Bauerle to have a deed
made by the late Mrs. Louisa Bauerle to
the latter canceled, Louisa Fromm to
day filed a contest to the will of her
mother, Louisa Bauerle. which will young
Bauerle recently filed for probate. Mrs.
Fromm alleges that at the time of the
signing and execution of the will her
mother was of unsound mind and that
she was acting under fraud and undue In
fluence perpetuated and exercised by her
son, Adolph H. Bauerle. Mrs. Fromm
alleges as a separate ground of contest
that her brother compelled the mother to
sign the will, threatening to Injure her
character by exposing her alleged crim
inal relations with one Henry Meyer in
1894. In this manner: "I'll let everybody
know who you are; I'll let them know
some of the dirty tricks you have been
doing," meaning said transaction with
Meyer. On these grounds Mrs. Fromm
contends that the will is void and she
asks that the petition for letters applied
for by her brother be denied.
SUIT BROUGHT TO
EJECT JUDGE BROWN
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â filing cf
a suit to-day to eject Attorney
Harvej' S. Brown and to collect arrears
In rent caused much surprise, it being
generally considered that Judge Brown,
who for many years was chief counsel for
the Southern Pacific Company, was a man
of vast wealth. A few weeks ago the
Judge's law library figured In a similar
suit.
Judge Brown Is closely connected with
some of the schemes engineered by the
notorious "Brick" McPherson, and recent
ly appeared as McPherson's attorney. It
was generally supposed that the Judge
had himself been a victim to McPherson's
wiles, but ho denies that he ever lost a
cent by the schemer. For a few years
Judge Brown has been a speculator, and
It would now appear that these ventures
have proven financially disastrous.
Up to a year ago the Judge was the
heaviest financial supporter of the Oak
land Psychic Society, being an ardent ad
mirer of the genius of Madame Montague,
the clever little spiritualist. Madame
Montague did many things that puzzled
her friends and her attorneys, but it is
not considered likely that she received
such support from the Judge as to involve
him in financial difficulties. Five years
ago the Judge was chief counsel for the
Southern Pacific Company In the conduct
of the great water front trials.

Captain Was Drunk.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 26.
There was one accident during the
gorgeous naval parade ln honor of Cali
fornia's returning warriors from Manila
last Thursday which, though lt attracted
but little notice at the time, has been
called to the attention of the Governor
and may result In an Investigation of the
Commissioners who have charge of the
Inspection of hulls and boilers of vessels
in San Francisco Bay.
The Cecelia, a steam launch, which ac
cording to several prominent people, who
were aboard her on Thursday, should
have been condemned long ago, if she is
not already ostracized from worthy craft
hood, was chartered by a young ljos
Angeleno, who . had conceived the ilea
of turning a few dollars by cruising
parties about the bay on the day of the
parade. X-XlX* â 
Many who had been' unable to secure
even standing room on good vessels at
any premium had availed themselves of
the, Cecelia's inducements, and among
the passengers that : made up the party
were M. -L. Wurts, the owner of the
Wurts block in this city, together with
his wife and his slstcr-ln-toiw. Miss Sny
der; Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Williams of 297

there were about twenty ladles - and

The Cecelia bad hardly left its moorings

BAY ROMANCE
REVEALED BY
BLANK NOTICE
Marriage on Ferry-
Boat Oakland.
Oakland Offlce, San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 26.
v â {-â :
>. On ferry steamer Oak
*> land, August 9, 1899, at 10 p. m., on
âº the Alameda side of the bay, by the
>* Rev. John A. B. Wilson, Mr.
** of San Francisco and Miss
\> of Los Angeles.
âº
The above marriage notice in yester- j
day's Call, which appears as a puzzle, was
made quite clear by a search in the rec- |
j ords in the County Recorder's office to- j
| day. The groom is Jacob T. Scholl of San j
Francisco and the bride Miss Christine H. |
Whitson of Los Angeles. In his license j
Mr. Scholl stated he was twenty-four
years old, while his wife ls Just six years
younger.
When they decided to be married a ro
mantic^ idea came into their heads. They
wanted to be the hero and heroine of a
tugboat marriage, but Scholl has read
so much in the newspapers recently re
garding the illegality of such weddings, j
that he decided to carry out his idea in i
an abridged manner. With his sweetheart I
he called on Rev. J. A. B. Wilson of San j
Francisco and told him of their desire, i
Miss Whitson had previously come to j
Oakland and secured the necessary 11- I
cense. Dr. Wilson told them that they
could not be married on that license un-
less they were within the jurisdiction of
Alameda county, but otherwise he was
quite willing to unite them on sea or land
or even in a balloon, so long as the wed
ding was one that could be entered into
in good faith by both parties.
Being assured that there was nothing :
more serious than a romantic notion In |
the affair. Rev. Wilson boarded the ferry- |
boat Oakland on the 9th inst. and after !
passing Goat Island the ceremony began. !
It was ended just before the boat reached ;
' the Oakland slip and was performed so i
quietly and in a remote corner of the j
salon, that the passengers were not aware i
' of the little incident.
The party returned to San Francisco on '
the same boat. Mr. and Mrs. Scholl went j
to their new home at 155 Blossom street !
and made no secret of their little es- j
i capade. !
It is not vet made plain why the Scholia
j should have published a skeleton wedding ;
I announcement two weeks after the cere- \
i mony. The license was recorded In this ;
: county by Rev. Dr. Wilson on August
1 14th.
and brother of the popular beaus,
Peter D. and Walter S. Martin. Mr.
Martin is one of the heirs of the vast
Donahue estate, and has quite a repu
tation as a host, entertaining fre
quently and jointly with his mother at
their elegant mansion on Broadway.
Since Mr. Goad's death the young
fiancee has divided her time between
her sisters, Mrs. Osgood Hooker (nee
Ella Goad), and Mrs. Charles K. Mc
intosh (nee Alleen Goad). As to the
approaching marriage no details have
as yet been arranged, but taking into
consideration the high social standing
of the young couple and their great
popularity it will probably be a bril
liant affair.
could be convinced of his recklessness !
the Impending danger became so realistic i
that life preservers were promptly put
about the women, who actually knelt
down on the deck and prayed and
screamed to be rescued. Suddenly the '
little craft crashed into the Newark, and
to avoid being totally wrecked by the
paddle wheels of the big steamer the men '
folks placed their hands so against the j
steamer that the little launch swayed
back, when the Newark was brought to j
a full stop and the Cecelia party rescued.
The Cecelia had her railing torn away,
while her decks and cabin were demol- -
ished, and if she was not condemned be- i
fore this her present condition precludes all
doubts as to her future. Her unworthi
ness as a craft and the fact of her navi- j
gator's Intoxication were promptly report
ed at the office of the Inspector of hulls ;
and boilers, in San Francisco.
"We had not left the inspector's office \
very far behind us," said Mr. Wurts.
"when we were followed and approached
by two men, who claimed to have come,
from the inspector's office. They wished
to know whether the matter could not be
compromised, and appeared to be very so- ,
licitous about it. We were in that frame '
of mind where we concluded that we had j
simply done our duty, and any monetary |
compromise was way out of the question.
On the other hand, the audacity to put
the proposition seemed to us so grotesque
that we deemed it a further duty to rile
a copy of our complaint with the Gov
ernor, pointing out that the Commission
ers were derelict in their duties in allow
ing such a craft as the Cecelia to go out,
and asking for an investigation.".
Attorney Uarnham was quite vigorous I
In his denunciation of the affair, that I
came so near ending disastrously, and he
declares that he will push the matter to j
an issue. _________________

the family plat In Laurel Hill Cemetery.
The deceased was one of the best known
men in San Francisco among the commer
cial .Mass. He was president of the Mor
ton Draying and Warehouse Company
I and also of the firm of the Morton Spe
j cial Delivery Company. In addition to
: these business interests Mr. Morton was
: known and recognized among the business
! men of this city as one of the early pio
neers and helpers in founding San Fran
cisco. He with his two brothersâReu
ben (deceased) and Sargent S.. receiver
in the United States Land Officeâ arrived
in San Francisco in the early 50's and at
| once proceeded to acquire property and
: make a home for themselves and their
1 families. -
The building and equipage of the
original Lone Mountain line of horse
cars that transferrred their pas
sengers at Turk and Taylor streets
for Lone Mountain, and also which
extended down Sixth street, as well
as the building of the Geary street cable
line from Kearny street to Central aye- !
nue, and from there to Golden Gate
Park by steam dummy, were some of
their prosperous undertakings. But chief-
lv draying was one which John Morton
stuck to with a will which placed him
at the. head of one of the best equipped
stables on the Pacific Coast. His ability
to handle heavy shipments had been rec
ognized by the United States Government
as soon as the Spanish war was declared
and after the great Dewey had silenced
the guns of Spain in the bay of Manila
then the Government contracted with
John Morton & Co. to do all of its haul-
ing from train to transport.
During the long years in which the Mor
ton brothers resided in this city they ac-
cumulated quite a large fortune, and at
one time they scarcely knew their wealth.
To show how easy it was to Induce them
to go into heavy Investments the late
James Fair induced John Morton to in-
vest in Best & Belcher, which cost him
$300,000. Since the death of Mrs. Morton,
about a year ago. the deceased lost heart
and after three days* sickness he died at
the age of 79 years. He leaves two sonsâ
W. R. and 11. D.â and one brother. Sar-
gent, to mourn his loss.
WEEOTT IN BAD LUCK.
The matter of the collision between the
Weeott and the McDowell last Friday
morning on the bay has been referred to
Port Collector Jackson. W. H. Ellis, the
master in charge of the Weeott. has a
master's license, but has no pilot 11
--cense which is required of the masters
of all' vessels plying in the waters of the
bay and its tributaries. The usual pen
alty in such cases is a fine of $100 on the
master and $500 on the owner of the yes-
The Weeott went on the rocks up the
coast a short time ago and the McDow
ell in July of last year collided with a
launch from the transport Scandia, caus
ing the death of Mrs. Paxton.
A Soldier Injured.
Thomas McDonough. a soldier, was in
ternally injured last evening riding
on a Haight-street car. When the car
reached Gough street it was struck by a
runaway horse. McDonough attempted to
turn the animal's head away, when he
was struck in the stomach by one of the
shafts. Injuring him severely. -He- was
taken to the railroad hospital, where the
doctors pronounced the wound dangerous.

WYOMING'S EXECUTIVE
SAW THE CELEBRATION
GOVERNOR D. F. RICHARDS cf Wyoming arrived at the Occidental last
night, where he will, remain until the transport Grant, now on her way here
with his State's volunteers, is reported. His object, and that of the large
party that accompanies him. Is- to be the first to extend the hand of wel
come to the brave lads who have done so much to uphold the honor of their flag
and to shed a glorious luster on the State they represent.
When seen last night shortly after his arrival Governor Richards said that as
soon as the Wyoming volunteers are mustered out they will be taken home in a
special train, the expense of which will be borne by the people of their State. As
soon as they arrive home they will be the guests of honor at a monster demonstra
tion which has been prepared for the occasion of their return.
Medals especially provided by Legislative action will be presented to them,
positions will be obtained for those out of employment and everything which a
grateful State has to offer will be theirs to command.
The Governor was met at the hotel by Colonel, Andrews, representing the State
executive, and the whole party, without waiting to go to their apartments, entered
carriages and hurried off to view the celebration. Which they subsequently char
acterized as the most magnificent affair of the sort they had ever witnessed.
Governor Richards was elected to his present position last fall, and before that
time had served with honor and distinction in both branches of his State's Legis
lature. '.X .'â *-'â '. *l -V-â¢

nomination for Governor:
Out of 802 there are only 289 instructed.
as follows: McLean 158. Kilbourne 69. I
Sherwood 36, Seward 11, Chapman 7, Has-
kell 8.
Of the 513 uninstructed men the McLean
men are as confident of 320 as of those
having instructions, making the McLean
vote 478 on the first ballot, or seventy-six
more than necessary. :â¢>
After the delegates once record their
vote for their local favorites, the McLean
men claim, not iess than 45 will go
to McLean, making his strength 523, or
121 more than necessary. The contested
votes will not change the result, as the
contests are said to be between McLean
men mostly. The principal contest is over
the 64 votes in Cuyahoga County.
Advices from different parts of the State
to-night concede the nomination of Mc-
Lean and show a good sentiment for Col-
onel James Kilbourne for Lieutenant Gov
ernor.

HALE AND HEARTY AT
FOUR SCORE AND TEN
"FATHER" WAUGH CELEBRATES HIS 91ST BIRTHDAY
VENERABLE FATHER LORENZO WAUGH. the oldest Methodist
oreacher on this coast, will celebrate the ninety-first anniversary of
bis j birth in Howard Methodist Episcopal Church this evening. He
will deliver an address on "'The Secret of a Green Old Age." Rev.
lohn A. B. Wilson will also speak. .
Father Waugh was born near Greenbrier River. West Virginia, on the
28th day of August, 1808. He was the oldest of twelve children. In his
younger days he knew Daniel Webster, John Quincy Adams, Thomas A.
Benton and other great men who figured in American history. He arrived
in California in 1852, having come over the plains in an ox team, and on his
arrival was met by General Vallejo, who made him a present of 320 acres in
Sonoma County. This land he afterward divided between his children,
retaining forty acres for himself, which he afterward sold for $5500.
It has always been the aged minister's boast that he never used tobacco
or intoxicating liquor of any kind, and to this fact he attribues his long life.
He is now residing in Los Olivos, Santa Barbara County.
mained on Market street until daylight.
At an early hour this morning it was
stated at the hospital that the soldier
picked up at Stockton and Market streets
would die from cerebral hemorrhage. He
is a member of Company A, First Cali
fornia Volunteers.
RECEPTION TO
BATTERY D
Battery D, First Battalion. California
Heavy Artillery, was visited in camp at
the Presidio yesterday afternoon by a
delegation of relatives and friends,' who
came all the way from Los Angeles and
Southern California to welcome . the sol
dier boys who hail from that section of
the State. The reception was something
in the nature of a. surprise and the artil
lerymen were completely carried off their
feet by the warmth of the greeting.
The Los Angelenos swooped down. upon
the camp shortly before 2 o'clock and
overwhelming the guard by sheer fore*
of numbers, gathered their heroes in their
arms and almost carried them to tne
Y. M. C. A. building within the reserva
tion, where for the next two hours they
were fondled, hugged, kissed and forced
to listen to eloquent words of praise
showered upon them by the orators from
the south. Then they were taken back
to their temporarily deserted camp and
feasted on fruits and other delicacies,
which they generously divided with their
comrades of Battery A.
Colonel A. L. Crane of Los Angeles pre
sided at the reception and made a very
brief speech telling of the object of the
gathering. Judge B. N. Smith of. the
Superior Court of Los Angeles County
followed with a stirring address filled
with patriotic utterances and words of
lavish but well deserved praise, which
brought a flush of embarrassment to the
browned faces of the soldiers before him.
Then came aged Captain Cameron E.
Thorn, an ex-Confederate and former
Mayor of Los Angeles; whose two sons
are members of the battery, who wel
comed the soldiers with a voice that
trembled with emotion. He was followed
by Colonel Blennernassett, also a veteran.
of the Confederate army, who made a
speech that vibrated with intensity of
feeling and brought the soldiers and all
present to their feet a dozen times cheer
ing like mad and as often sent the tears
unconsciously coursing down their cheeks.
But the climax of the reception came
during a speech by Lieutenant Diss of
Battery D when that officer referred to
the good angel of the artillery organiza
tion, Mrs. J. M. Griffith of Los Angeles.
In opening his remarks he eaid:
"When we learned of the magnificent
reception San Francisco was preparing in
honor of the returning California volun
teers we expected that naturally the First
Regiment would overshadow us. In fact
we expected to be lost in the shuffle; but
we have been found and found so well
that we are practically foundered."
Then the speaker referreu to the grand
work and open-handed generosity of Mr?.
Griffith. In an Instant every batteryman
was on his feet waving his hat and cheer
ing like a lunatic. It was a spontaneous
outburst of affectionate regard that lasted
until the hysterical soldiers* were too
breathless to continue. The object of this
remarkable demonstration was too much
overcome to respond in words. She could
only bow her thanks wnile she . choked
down the sobs struggling In her throat.
Later, at her request. Secretary W. H.
Anderson made a short speech in her be.
half, thanking the volunteers for the
tribute. -* .;;'-â <-â - .â â -*â _- *'.*; Â£ ._â¢â  XI-
Mayor Fred Eaton of Los Angeles. Cap

Fehnemann made short speeches and the
Mayor promised the boys an even greater
and more enthusiastic reception upon
their return than they received in San
Francisco. .-' : - > - -
The following resolutions of thanks
were adopted, after which the . soldiers
and their friends from home returned to
their camp on the hillside: ' .

POLITICIAN GOULD
SEEKING A DIVORCE
HE CHARGES HIS WIFE WITH
CRUELTY.
CRUELTY.
Complaint Filed by His Attorneys,
William H. Alford and Gavin
McNab â Allega
tions Are Made.
Frank H. Gould, lawyer and politician,
filed suit yesterday for a divorce from his
wife, Mrs. N. Gould. Cruelty is alleged
as the cause of action. William H. Alford
and Gavin McNab, also well known in the
political arena, appear as counsel for the
plaintiff.
In the complaint numerous specific in
stances of cruelty are cited. Although
some of the most intimate friends of the
principals have been aware that they were
not living happily together of late, still
the news of the divorce proceedings will
occasion considerable surprise among the
majority of their acquaintances.

INSECTICIDE POISON.
Coroner Hill Does Not Believe the
Ptomaines Caused Mrs.
Dunn's Death.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
morning into the cause of the death of
Mrs. Jane L. Dunn of 1218 Hyde street.
The Jury returned a verdict of accidental
death. Dr. Boericke explained to the Cor
oner that he had not reported the case
to the Morgue because he had been in at- |
tendance on the deceased for more than
forty-eight hours and did not know that
under the circumstances he would be re
quired to make a report.
On account of the body having been em
balmed there was no opportunity to make
an autopsy to determine the cause of '
death. The Coroner is of the opinion that
some insecticide preparation had been
placed on the cantaloupe eaten by the
family and that the poison was absorbed
by the soft fruit.
Mr. Dunn, the husband of the deceased
was reported out of danger yesterday af
ternoon.

Honors â Finished First on
Three Occasions â
Contested Races.
A very* fair-sized crowd of racegoers at
tended the opening of the Golden Gate
Fair Association's race meet at Oakland
track yesterday. The programme con
sisted entirely of running events, the har
ness horses being kept in the background

much larger had the meeting been more
extensively advertised.

I the six races all being well filled. Eddie
; Jones carritd off the saddle honors by
piloting The Echo, Engea and The Buf-
I foon, all favorites In the betting, past the
; judges in front. In the other events Pol-
I ish, at 12 to 1,- and Roadrunner, with odds
of 7 to 1 about him, pulled the books out
more than even. Mike Rice, a second
! choice, captured his race in commanding
fashion.
J. \V. Brooks, handicapper for the Cali
! fornia Jockey Club, acted as presiding
I judge. With a fractious lot of riders to
contend with, the starting of Dick Havey
! gave perfect satisfaction.
| The sport began with a five-furlong
scramble for maiden two-year-olds. Re-
port had The Echo, a nicely turned daugh
ter of Imp. Artillery', going great guns in
her work, and she was in big demand at
short odds. There was nothing to it from
the start, the filly winning in a romp.
Sunello took the place handily enough
from My Gypsy. The winner is a candi
date for and undoubtedly has a Very rosy
chance to win the rich Futurity stake,
soon to be decided at Sacramento.
Sold to the Elmwood stock farm some
months ago for a twenty-dollar piece,
Engea finally won a race. Meeting a
trashy assortment of maidens In a six
furlong run which followed, she was
played from threes to 8 to 5 favoritism,
and won all the way. Driving hard for
the place, Somls led Lomo out less than ;
a length. |
The tip on Hohenlohe made that horse
a sizzling hot favorite for the third num
ber, but he failed utterly to run to ex-
pectations. Frawley managed to get Pol
ish away In the lead and fairly spread-
eagled his field. Chihuahua, on whicn
there- was an extensive play, downed the
flrst choice for place honors.
Eight more maiden two-year-olds faced
the barrier in the sprint following, with
The Buffoon an even-money chance. Hali-
fax, an 8 to 1 shot, looked a winner at the
stretch turn, but closed up. and the favor-
ite won ridden out from Expedient.
About the hardest dump the crowd re-
ceived was the unlooked for defeat of
Novia. The big bettors unloosened when S
the fifth race came around, and the odds j
against the mare were hammered down |
from 2 to 1 to 4 to 5. She had been espe
cially primed and prepared for the occa
sion, but could never get to the front. I
Eddie Jones, on the second choice, Mike !
Rice, was away first, and never headed I
â won handily from Major Cook. The fa- i
vorite finished in the show.
Young Henry may be a "comer," but he I
.made very botchy work of it in the sad-
dle with the leg up on Ringmaster in the
final mile run. The boy covered all the
ground he could find, and on plainly the I
best horse finished third. Old Lovda'l was
made an even-money chance, but was out-
footed and beaten a length by Roadrun- I
ncr, ridden by Macklin.
MORE GAME VIOLATORS.
D. E. Allison Arrested for Having
Wild Grouse in His Pos-
Wild Grouse in His Pos-
session.
If the precedents of high fines for those
who violate the game laws established by
the Police Judges of this city are to be
followed, another dealer in game is fated
to pay dearly for his offense. The party's
name is D. E. Allison, who conducts a
: commission house on Front street, near
I Washington. Yesterday he was arrested
j by Deputy Game and Fish Commissioner
Charles A. Vogelsang for having grouse
;in his possession out of season. Allison
i had just received a bag of these birds
| from Red Rock. Lassen County, and when
he was taken into custody he pretended
to be very indignant, claiming that the
game was sage hens.
* Even if the deputy had acquiesced that
the birds were sage hens the dealer would
still be in a bad fix, for the sage hen or
sage cock is of the grouse family, and
the law does not make any distinction as
to the different varieties of the family,
all being protected alike until the open
season, which begins on September 1. It
Is believed that the Police Judges will
keep up the pace they have set in the
matter of severely punishing all offenders.

TWELVE HORSES BURNED.
Stables, Stores and Houses Destroyed
in the Western Addition.
A blaze causing a loss of property to the
value of about $25,000 occurred last even
ing in the Western Addition. It started
in the West End stables on California
street, between Fillmore and Stelner, and
before the Fire Department could reach
the place In response to an alarm from j
box 216 the structure and contents were I
almost totally destroyed. From the stable I
the flames spread to the three-story frame I
building, occupied as flats, which is owned j
by E. F. Preston, the attorney. The
stores on the ground floor were gutted and
the structure above was so badly damaged j
as to necessitate rebuilding.
Another stable on the opposite side to i
the one flrst mentioned, owned by C.
Greaver, was also badly damaged. A
heavy wind carried the flre into the resi
dence of Mrs. Asher of 2511 Sacramento
street, burning the rear part badly. A
residence adjoining, . No. 2513 Sacramento
street, was also considerably burned. So
fierce was the blaze that It swung around
to both ends of the stables and completely
shut off ecape for the horses that were
kept there, and as a result about a dozen
fine horses were burned to death. How
the fire started Is not known. The West
ern Addition Fire Department men did
excellent service in checking the blaze as
quickly as they did. , :â¢; â

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. 26.â The market opened
with yesterday's drooping tendency still in
force, and the weakness was not entirely over-
come during the short session although there
wpre Improvements. The London Exchange
was dosed for a holiday, leaving some uncer
tainty as to the. speculative sentiment of that
center, which was depressed yesterday. Added
to this was a *.. -L... tone in Sugar on a new
crop of rumors of a new phase of the war In
the sugar trade. The new stocks of "the Re-
public Steel 1 nil any, dealt In on the ex-
change for the first time yesterday, showed
a disinclination to maintain the price, estab
. lished for them yesterday,' and Norfolk and
Western ar.d Northern Pacific in the railroad
group showed a reactionary tendency. Con-
solidated Gas dropped an extreme 4%. Brook-
lyn Transit was heavy, and there were other
less important. points of weakness. In "the sec-
ond, hour of the session th" traders manifested
-a disposition to cover short contracts, appar
ently In the belief that the unfavorable char-
acter of the bank statement had been exag
gerated, as proved to be the case. Idle and
Ohio gained about 3 and Northern Pacific ral-
lled over a point. Great Western preferred
gained 3. Louisville, Chicago and Western Il
linois. St. Paul and Duluth and the Tobacco
stocks a point or over. Sugar advanced an
extreme 2% and became very feverish, serving
to unsettle the market. The recovery in the
general list, howver, held for the most part.
A feature was the movement In a number of
Insignificant stocks, Including Peoria and East-
em. Kaiiawana and Michigan. Keokuk and
Dcs Moines and Colorado Coal Development
' Company. In view of the" forced liquidation
ln Brooklyn Transit early in the week the ex-
tension of credits to the amount of *9,0_*6,000
shown by the tank 'Statement came as a sur-
prise The decrease la cash proved to be less
than a million, whereas the knout, movements
of money Indicated that it would be 83.500,
- The decline in the surplus Is. therefore,
largely due to Increase of reserve requirements
by reason of the loan expansion. Viewed apart
from the previous exaggerated estimates, the
return is weak.
The changes are Impossible of explanation
from any transactions known to the public.
The action of the stock market was very Ir-
regular and somewhat puzzling during the
week. A number of the most prominent spec-
ialties and industrials showed extreme demor
alization in the week. The raids by the bears
Upon these stocks were commonly supposed to
be a tactical maneuver with the object of ob-
structing the disposition of the general list
to advance. As a matter of fact, the violent
breaks in the specialties proved Ineffective to
prevent â -. rise of various railroad stocks.
Whet, powerful support In the specialties frus
trated the attempts of the. bears to work fur-
ther declines and the way seemed open for a
general advance In prices, the upward move-
ment was met by such heavy offerings to take
profits that, a sentiment of hesitation reas
serted Itself.
A comparison of prices showed some very
substantial gains in a small number of the
.railroad stocks and some severe losses in the .
Industrials. In the majority of the standard
railroad stocks net changes are small, nor hAS
there been any marked activity In these stocks j
during thÂ» week Quite a number of South- i
crn and Southwestern railroads show reac
tions from recent high prices on profit-taking, ,
which has been on a very large scale. It has
been Sufficiently obvious that the tendency of
thÂ« market to advance was chiefly due to oper
ations by pools formed by professional specu
lators. The buying of 5000 shares of, slocks ;
and then bidding several points higher for 100 ,
shares is a quite familiar process on Wall
street, but In a number of cases this week the
.higher bid developed nn astonishing . amount
of stocit waiting to realize. A good deal of
t<*d** according to the opinion of specialists.
Is that stock that was bought at a higher level
last spring by that portion of the population
designated in Wall street as the "outside pub-
lie'" having held through a heavy decline, these
owners are eager to take a small profit or
even to get out -without loss. In the higher
railroad stocks, such as the grangers . and
trunk lines, prices were long ago made to dis-
count expected increases in dividend rates.
In some cases these increases have not come.
In spite of large gains In earnings, but prices
have been maintained at the high level. The
return on the purchase money at present divi
dend rates of many standard railroads is less
thnn on high-grade bonds. Moerover, the great
activity in ail branches of trade and Industry
and the employment thus found for money
has made a rate for money which tempts to
the conversion of securities into floating capi
tal Last year authorities In the financial
world predicted that the return on capital
would be permanent at 3Â©3% per cent, and
prices of high-grade securities were run up
accordingly. With the money in the market

I yielding 4 .per cent or better In loans, the
j holding of stocks and bonds on the high level
of prices becomes somewhat precarious. This
is shown in gilt-edge railroad bonds and on
Government bonrie. both here and abroad.
That money is likely to continue firm at least
as the present level is the evident expecta
tion of the world s financial authorities, as cvi

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Aug. 26.â Wheat opened weak at
from 4c to %c decline. Most of the trading
was in December, but September was given
considerable attention and developed full as
' much weakness as the latter month. Beyond
: a decline at Liverpool and ideal harvesting
j weather in the Northwest there was nothing at
I first to Influence selling. Nevertheless, the mi
i clination to liquidate was quite general, and
: but little support was given the market except
' from shorts, who early in the day bought In
Considerable quantities. The Northwest was
1 even weaker than the local market, and this
toon Lime a prominent factor, heavy selling
t orders coming from that section, which Induced
liquidation by local longs and also brought
celling orders through commission houses. The
result was a steady decline, the market get-
ting under puts and even then receiving no
substantial support. The cash market was
badly out ot line, bids being generally less
; than Vi cent over September for No. 1 North-
I crn which shippers would not accept. Later
| It was reported that several loads had been
worked, but the effect of this was offset by
i advices from the Northwest that much heavier
receipts were expected next week. This was
discounted by shorts, who sold heavily, and
! In the last hour of the short Saturday session
1 the bottom apparently dropped out .of the
â¢ â  market. September wheat opened %o%c lower
'at 71% c. declined to 76% c and reacted to
70% c. where it closed. December opened %@%C
I lower at 73%<ij73%c, declined to 72% c and closed
I at 72% c asked.
! Corn was decidedly weak for September and
I easy for other futures. Heavy receipts caused
selling. September closed %f_.%c lower.
i Oats, considering the weakness of other
I grain markets, were steady. September closed"
'.'i. V lower.
Provisions were dull and weak, Influenced a
little by the decline in grain markets. There
. was scattered liquidation by outsiders, and
scalping longs sold a little. At the decline
packers were fair buyers of all products, and
the market was steady at the close. The cash
! demand for meats was goo.l. At the close
j September pork was 5 cents lower, lard 5 cents
lower and ribs 7%c lower.

point that buyers are beginning to run on East

stocks are lower than for some time.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
There Is not much change to note In any
thing. The local demand for all fruits is brisk
at the moment and there Is no accumulation of
stock. At the same time there is no scarcity
in any description. The canners are taking a
reasonable quantity of Pears and Peaches at
the quotations. Supplies of Grapes are not as
heavy as they have been and the market Is
rather steadier in consequence. Berries are
cheap. Small black Figs are doing better.
Quinces are in light supply and steady. Melons
are rather higher.

PLAYER FOLK
THROUGH THE
CRITICS EYE
WITHOUT anything having been
said to provoke such a confession,
I may say that the remark in
Tuesday's issue, written between
"churchyard yawning and cock-crowing,"
about the wooden Inexperience with which
Oscar Norfleet handled his death, looked
at me rather accusingly from the printed
page. It is a question in my mind whether
any one could have done it better. To
face the audience and die at length, with
a Journal of last messages upon the lips
messages that could and should have been
delivered before the duelâls such a cruel
and inartistic demand for a play to make
upon an actor that he should bo commis
serated rather than criticized. I cry "pec
cavi." Dissolution is at best a grewsome
process, and it is the creed of my dra
matic faith that death scenes will by tho
sword of revolution be lopped from the
drama of the future. Such scenes, coming
down to us with the classics from former
generations, are like the ark of the cov
enant, too sacred to be touched; but the
modern play need not, in pursuit of real-
Ism, lengthen out its acts with mawkish
and unreal gloom. In "Cavallerla Rub
tlcana" Alflo and Turrldu'flght their duel
to a mortal finish behind the scenes. This
piece of art needs no applause. It recom
mends itself by its visible influence on the
opinions of the people, who feel, if they
do not express a quiet relief at this
thoughtful indulgence to their sympathies.
Last week the suggestion was made that
the death of Rake in the desert be cut
from "Under Two Flags." It was tried
and found very good, though it did lead
to a humorous incident. The audience
missed a scene, and, tenacious of its
rights sat after the last drop, waiting,
like Oliver Twist, for "more." Mr. Lada
played the recessional, but no one budged.
Rising to the occasion, he faced the audi
ence with "Home, Sweet Home," and ges
tures indicating the exit. A short pause,
and then the solemn sitting broke up In
flee I have wandered some from "A
outhern Gentleman" and its death scene,
but since I have no affection for either
this is not remarkable. Next week Ho
henstauffen will be welcomed back, for Mr.
Clement has created here a truly human
interesting character, and his portrayal of
the role easily placed him upon a dra
matic height from which he will not easily
be lifted down. Tliere is some talk of his
playing "The Bells." I hope it ls not
mere hearsay.

Temporary* circumstances not possible
to override sometimes lessen the interest
of an Orpheum bill, but no management
keeps better faith with the people than
the Orpheum management. This con
stant and generally successful effort to
give the best is a pretty good touchstone
by which to try the services of those one
trusts. Felix Morris and a picked com
pany present this week Kerry," a one
act play, taken from Boucicault's "Night

Hazel Callahan do a new spectacular mir
ror dance; the Mouliere sisters perform on
the triple bar; Apollo bounds on a wire,
and the old favorites do new specialties.

Art, industry and time, the three most
powerful agents of progress, are produc
ing so much that Is forceful and admir
able in the dramatic world that the pauc
ity of new comic opera is the more ap
parent. A manager can return from the
East with his pockets stuffed with plays
one has never seen presented all
good, to be sure, but if one good comic
opera be found it is a signal for rejoicing
and Immediate praise service. Half the
world is early put to the piano. Much of
this musical energy is well directed and
good musicians are thus produced; but,
alas! so many of them are only musicians.
Genius has been cultivated at the expense
of general education and a certain narrow
mindedness not in touch with the world
is the result. Tlie librettist is supposed
to supply material for Inspiration, but
how shall the musician produce melody
for what he is not in sympathy with? The
best comic opera will be written by the
man who can do both. Comic opera
touches a large community with its influ
ence, and why should it be beneath the
ambitions of those who can handle a
theme with classical correctness? But
what I started out to say is that in spite
of this lack of material the Grand Opera
house, by reason of careful rehearsal and
novel spectacle, gives new interest to the
old and generally rewards its patrons lib
erally for their patronage. "Paul Jones"
is billed for Monday.
Mr. White Whittlesey played i Ingomar
last season to Miss Arthur's Parthenia
and easily shared the honors of the per
formance. To-morrow night the play is to
be produced at the Alcazar and an elab
orate production is promised. This is
Miss Roberts' last week. Her departure
will be regretted and her return looked
forward to with pleasure.

At last Barron Berthald, the splendid
tenor of the Tivoll grand opera company,
has gained recognition as Canio In "Pagli
acci." The public may not Immediately
appreciate the flne achievements of an
accomplished singer, but sooner or later
his value will become known, and then
the people are never backward In be
stowing the necessary applause. Thus It
occurred that Mr. Berthald was the sensa
tion of last week. His Canio was a veri
table revelation. In vocallsm, as well as
dramatic declamation, he obtained the
most gratifying results, and the many
curtain calls he received afforded ample
proof of the high esteem in which he is
held by those who witnessed his delightful
performance. Mr. Berthald is one of !
those few truly earnest artists who at
tend strictly to their duty by doing legiti
mate work without resorting to any
angling for effects.
Next week the Tlvoli will present two
operas whose worth is always appreciated
by the people, namely, "La Giaconda"
and "Rigoletto." The former will be pre
sented by the successful trio, Avedano,
Sala#sa and Miss Llchter, while the latter
will contain Miss Prossnitz, Berthald and
Mertens. This evening Mr. Berthald will
be heard for the first time as Turridu In
"Cavallerla Rusticana," and those who
desire to hear an interesting and artistic
performance of this effective role should
not fail to visit the theater. The more
the Tivoll season progresses the more
creditable become the performances.
In reviving the music of Suppe the
Grand Opera-house made a very wise
move, for his operas are among those
which are truly good and retain neverthe
less the popular favor. The dashing,
rhythmic spirit that runs through "Clo
ver" will never fail to please the masses,
and whenever music is thus constructed
that lt harbors besides a meritorious qual

The Ilarmonle Singing Society, under
the direction of Herman Genss, is dili
gently preparing for a series of grand
concerts to be given next season and as

It is announced that the German Thea
ter is to be reopened. For some time
these performances were discontinued be
cause of the fact that the management
was unable to obtain a suitable place. It
seems, however, that they succeeded in
making satisfactory arrangements with
the management of the Bush-street Thea
ter, where the performances will soon be
resumed. No definite date has as yet been
fixed for the commencement of the new
season. It will be announced later.

j*********' beneath the placid waters of her
* blue bay, Â«*.. blue that it la un
equaled, save by beautiful Naples, there
lies the treasure of all historical relics
but a few fathoms beneath the surface.
It Is nothing more nor less than the
rotting timbers of the good ship Na
talie, formerly the Inconstant, the
ptanch little craft that played so im
portant a part in the making of the
world's history. This small, helpless
wreck, whose slender ribs are now over
grown with eeaweed, was the ship
which conveyed the great Napoleon
from Elba to France, whence he had
been exiled.
After having served France for a
r served France for a
number of years the Inconstant was
Bold to the Mexican Government and
used on this coast In the early '40's as
a coeta garda, cr revenue cutter. When
she became the property of the Span
lards her name as changed to the
Natalie. In IS-13 she was wrecked ln
Monterey Bay. where her poor old
bones are still visible on the sandy bot
tom.
The story is most intensely interest-
â  Is â¢ int rest
ing, especially when told by some of
the old residents of this quiet little
ultra Mexican town, which always re
minds one of a leaf tern from some
book of early history of Alta California.
Captain Lambert, an old and highly
ighly
respectable resident of Monterey, a man
of most striking and magnetic presence,
coupled with great intelligence, one
. one
who has read, traveled and observed
much, and what is better still, mem*
bered lt all, gives a most graphic de
scription of the .wreck and history of
this noted brigantine that had seen
Eervice in all waters and played her
little part in changing the map of the
world. According to Captain Lambert's
narrative the Natalie was doing service
as a customs cruiser for the Mexican
Government in ISI3.
The circumstances of the return of
; " rel am of
Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba to hi.-*
beloved France are well known to all,
but lt Is remarkable that the only tan
gible remnant of that hazardous under
taking, the brigantine Natalie, lies
buried but a few fathoms beneath the
surface of Monterey Bay. There for
fifty-five years the sea fauna and the
teredo have been close companions of
the brave little ship.
The Inconstant was selected for the
ted for the
*.ââ *â¢ 'because she was the smartest
craft, the swiftest sailer and command
ed by the most loyal and daring master
of all the oiu French skippers.
The month of February, 1815, wit
nessed the consummation of this incon
ceivable undertaking, which threatened
the peace of Europe and upset the plans
of the continental statesmen. Fro*n th<_
22d to the 25th of tat month the brig
antine cruised off the island of Elba,
watching and waiting for a' prear
ranged signal from the loyal hearts
ashore. On the night of the 25th the
Blgnal flashed tho glad intelligence that
all was in readiness and twenty-four
hours later Napoleon Bonaparte was
safe on the quarterdeck.
A voyage of three days landed him
at Cannes, where he was greeted with
the shouts and tears of nearly a thou
sand veterans, the remnant of the im
mortal Guard. By Judiciously worded
proclamations, In which he promised
security of property to the people, to
the soldiers martial fame and to the
citizen class a constitution in accord
ance with the demands of the age, he
quickly won all hearts. Marshals
fioult, Ney and Massena were won over
In turn, the tricolor was brought from
its concealment and publicly set up
everywhere again.
In vain did the Count d'Artois hasten
to Lyons to save his brother's throne.
He was encountered by the universal
cry of "Vive l'Empereur!" On March
2<Â» and before a shot was fired, Louis
XVIII fled from the throne to which
he had Just been restored by the com
bined armies of the world and Napoleon
was once more Dictator, only to fall
again and forever, and leave his bones
resting on a foreign shore, Just as be
fell the historic little Natalie in Mon
terey Bay.
"One night," said Captain Lambert.
"It was In March of the same year, the
commander of the Natalie, together
v.ith all the officers of th** wardroom.
came ashore to enjoy themselves in the
customary amusement of the times a
fandango. The night was dark and a
heavy fog hung to westward of the bay.
A more ireful skipper would probably
have taken greater precautions and
Been to It that his ship was safely
moored against the chance of the nasty
weather which threatened her safety.
But then, you know what a Mexican ls
In ordinary ranch life. It is always
'man .na,' and he is no better as a
shipmaster. Everything Is put off till
the morrow. So he left his ship almost
unprotected, with nothing better than
a pleasure-loving Mexican crew to
guard her from the threatening dan
gers.
"Soon after the captain had landed
'â¢ captain had landed
with his staff the weather shut down
thick. The crew, realizing that they
were unobserved, concluded that it
would be real fun to take a hand In the
fandango themselves. They piled Into
the long boat and pulled ashore, leav
ing the little brigantine to fight her
own battles with wind and waves. The
officers of the Natalie repaired to what
was then known as the most notorious
dancehouse in Californiaâ Bai Oro,
or Golden Ball, which was situated on
the corner of Pearl and Alvarado
Btreetsâ there it is, just across the
.street," said Captain Lambert, pointing
to a quite modern-looking two-story
building opposite. "Although she looks
a bit modern now, you must know that,
like most of the old adobes in this town,
the original walls only remain, the rest
having been rebuilt to fulfill the re
quirements of the times." However,
that is the old Golden Ball.
"Well, as I have remarked, the Na
talie was left without a man jack to
lend a hand, and when the morning
broke, after a heavy southeast night,
not a spar nor a timber was left vis
ible above the water. The gritty little
ship had broken her moorings and
dragged her helpless hulk to th** shal
low, shelving beach, not more than 200
yards from shore, where she foundered,
and there she lies to this day, hammer
ing her tough little teak bones on the
sandy bottom of Monterey Bay.
"And she was teak built, too," said
Captain Lambert, with an honest glow
of reminiscent pride, "the kind of ship
you don't see nowadays; solid teak and
copper fastened, with copper bolts as
heavy as the stanchions on a modern
battleship. Just walk over here with
me to Duarte's flsh market. I will show
you the Natalie's rudder.
This was washed ashore, or rather
was loosened from the ship during a
heavy southeast storm last winter, and
young Mr. Duarte, by careful diving
and bottom searching, secured the rud
der and brought it ashore just as you
see it now. Take your penknife and
cut Into the wood. See how firm the
grain is.
"Now, my boy, those were the days
when they built ships to last for gener
ations. No iron or steel ship of mod
ern construction could possibly have
withstood the wear and tear of fifty
five years beneath the water and leave
a piece of this size in sight. Just no
tice the copper bolts with which she is
braced. Why, the copper itself in that
rudder Is worth $20 to-day, and her
fastenings when she was built must
have cost a small fortune. No, she was
not of the old-fashioned,, round-bowed,
high-pooped style that you might Im
agine. She was rather a smart-look
ing, trim-built little brigantine, and
her lines were similar to those you
will find in the South Sea Island trade
to-day. Of course, her shrouds and
cordage were much heavier than you
Bee on the modern craft, as steel rig
ping was entirely unknown in her time.
But, all ln all, she was a sleek, well
built little vessel, with a clean pair of
heels that might have shown great
sailing qualities.
"Yes, she was armed after a fashion.
She carried one bronze swivel gun for
ward and small arms, principally old
fashioned Spanish rifles and cutlasses
in brackets about the masts 'tween
decks. It would probably be worth a
diver's while to make a diligent Bearch
for that old bronze cannon, for lt would
certainly bring a fair price from, any
collector of historical curiosities. No,
to my knowledge no one has ever at
tempted to rescue this rare piece of
metal.
"Oh! you need have no doubts as to
the authenticity of the ship. She ls the
same bit of marine architecture that
carried Napoleon to France upon his
escape from Elba when he started on
his last 'wild rampage with the avowed
intention of changing the political ge
ography of the world. Had it not been
for his terrible repulse and downfall
at Waterloo, it is very probable that
the Natalie would not this day be
grinding her bleached bones beneath
the waters of Monterey, but on the con
trary she would be preserved by France
as the ship which had conveyed the
greatest general from exile to his
grandest victory.
Captain Bralee, another old-time
skipper, who lives in Monterey, re
members the vessel, which was plainly
visible when he arrived there in 1844.
Captain Bralee said: "I arrived in Mon
terey on Admiral Sloat's flagship, the
Savannah, In IS 14. We were warned by
the harbor master to beware of our an
chorage, as a Mexican revenue cutter
had been sunk and her upper works
came very near the surface. I have
looked at the old ship many times in
the last fifty years and have watched
the gradual decay of the historical old
vessel. She was undoubtedly the ship
which carried Napoleon from Elba to
France, just previous to the battle of
Waterloo.
"She was a brigantine â that is. a
two-masted craft, square-rigged for
ward, with fore and aft sails on main
mastsomething seldom seen at the
present time. She was constructed on
what might -be -termed* modern â¢ -Tines.
and was wrecked in the hay of Mon
terey in March, 1843, through the crimi
nal negligence of her captain and crew.
who left her without bo much as an an
chor watch on j a threatening night
when there was every indication- of ap
proaching bad . weather, that they
might enjoy themselves in" debauchery
ashore. â â â â â â 
"She was considered a clever little
ship In her day, and had seen service
in many parts of the world, and prob
ably had a historical record of irreater
Importance than any vessel of which
a vestige is left at the present time in
these waters.
"I have an affection for the old hulk
because I have watched her for so
many years. If I had the money I
should like to have her old bones fished
up from the bottom, set them up and
give them a covering of planking, so
we could exhibit her to the present gen
eration as one of the relics of the past
She is certainly worthy* of some better
fate, and a few years will mean the
total destruction of what remains of
the brave little craft.' Every heavy gale
during the winter months brings one or
more pieces of her timber ashore.
"You may depend upon it, nobody
will dispute my knowledge of the his
tory of this place. As I told you be
fore, I came here on the old flagship
Savannah with Admiral Sloat. No. I
am not the man who was ordered- to
hoist the flag at Monterey. I am quite
sure that no individual was. told to do
so. As a boat's crew we were ordered
to do so collectively, and I was one of
the crew. It was the proudest moment
of my life when I took a heave on those
halyards, and when I saw Old Glory
slide up to the truck of that flagstaff
I realized' that the United States had
added another star to the banner which
would eventually outshine them all. I
am not at all disappointed, either. I
am now an old man, but I have had
the satisfaction of seeing this State
emerge from a miserable little Mexican
province to one of the greatest agri
cultural districts of .the world.. I: am
proud of this State, and I am proud
of the little I had to do with its transi
tion. I was only wrong in one forecast;
I really expected . to see ' Monterey a
great' seaport ; - 'I ' had ' every * reason "to
believe that in* the course of years -this
beautiful ay would divide honors
with San Francisco the way of com
merce.' I was wrong in this respect as
you can see.'* â  ' * -
"I have carefully studied the history
of Napoleon's escape from Elba, and I
am positive the Natalie is the ship that
carried him to 'his final , eat. Many
people have said that heY original name
.was ' the Undaunted; which Is* a 1 mistake.
The Undaunted was the vessel that
carried him from France to Elba.
"The result of that last battle was in
my opinion the best thing that could
have happened, for had he won that
Tight, the whole world would have been
at his mercy, and although a great gen
eral, he was not a merciful man by any
means. . All, ' Europe had , combined
against this one man, determined to
do- i him if such a thing were poaslbla,
and they succeeded.
"Just think of the egotism of the man
on the night preceding the battle. It
had been raining and the night waa
dark and threatening. .Napoleon
walked over the ground, aa was his
custom before a battle. Lightning
flashed and thunder rolled like the
heavy can-.onading which waa but
music to his ears. When he had
reached the center of the field he
paused, and, wrapping hia martial
cloak about his shivering body looked
up into the sky and remarked, "God,
we are agreed." He actually believed
he was in league with his Maker to
conquer the world, but Ood was not
with him on this particular occasion.
The fates had ordained otherswise.
"Napoleon waa lost to fame forever,
and for over flfty years the little ship
that did so much to bring about thia
result haa been dead to history* It
seems like neglecting a corpse to leave
her poor skeleton out there on tha
sandy bottom of Monterey Bay.
"I am sometimes inclined to believe
that aa a people we have very little
reverence ln our make-up. Our rich
men go abroad year after year that
they may Improve themselves by view
ing the treasures that have been care
fully preserved by all of the great na
tions of Europe, yet they simply Ig
nore things of far greater interest at
home, and the wreck of the Natalia la
a. fair sample of our neglect."
In an obscure corner of the Btstta
Mining Bureau may be found a pieo*
of worm-eaten timber which is labeled
something after the following:
"This is a piece of the ship Natalie.
This ship was the one that carried Na
poleon from Elba to France just be
fore the battle of Waterloo. She was
wrecked in Monterey Bay in 1843." No
further interest has ever been taken
in the matter by our local historians.

may be. seated upon an adamantine
wooden bench, while she, hidden in the
fastnesses of the matron's small do
main, decides that momentous ques
tion.
I havo heard much of Mrs. Mills and
the crimes charged against her since
she emerged from the obscurity of pri
vate life into the fierce light of public
ity which In these days beats so cruelly
and unsparingly upon innocent or
guilty, once the unfortunate has suf
fered the ignominy of arrest-
It Is alleged that the "Woman ln
Black" has, during the past few
months, stolen diamonds and other
jewelry amounting ln value to at least
$25, X- sides the three dimes and the
five one-cent pieces, which, being
found In her pocketbook and positively
identified by a lady guest of the Hotel
Stewart as her own especial property.
are the only really tangible causes of
her present Imprisonment.
I have been Informed that she Is a
morphine "fiend." Privately, I am
prejudiced against the woman, and
look forward to the interview which I
am seeking as an unpleaslng but nec
essary experience to be gone through
with as quickly as possible.
It takes her an unconscionably long
time to make up her mind concerning
the advisability of seeing me, but final
ly I hear a soft rustle of skirts and,
looking up, see a woman standing be
fore m**.
The attitude â drooping shoulders,
the head bent slightly forward and the
hand-2 clasped just below her waist â Is
that of a timid schoolgirl accused of a
fault and uncertain whether the per
son to whom she Is about to appeal la
going to blame or exonerate her.
"I am Mrs. Miils." she says simply,
and I note that with a fine sense of
her position she does not offer me any
Other greeting. She feels that I have
come to see her as a matter of busi
ness, and she has made up her mind
to dure the infliction of my Inter
rogative presence just as I made up
my mind to endure the fiendish tortures
inflicted by my dentist.
She sits down on the bench at a lit
tle distance and, gazing straight ahead,
waits for me to begin the conversation.
I am In despair. I cannot possibly talk
to a profile, especially one as Impassive
as Is this woman's, and besides. I want
to see her eyes. An observant and
gallant officer heaves In sight with the
only loose chair obtainable, and my
difficulty Is at an end.
Seated squarely In front of her, I
wonder ln my soul how some newspa
per artists can be as they are and live.
There Is absolutely nothing of the an
archist or the low lodglnghouse-keeper
ln her face or expression or manner.
She is a woman of medium size, whose
bones are just softly cushioned with
flesh, and no more. Evidently In her
early thirties, her face still has a child
ish roundness of contour, except where
the cheeks sag a little each side of the
firm chin ln a way which tells of mus
cles made flaccid by either years or ill
ness.
She has a forehead which is both
wide and prominent, a pair of prettily
curved dark eyebrows, and clear blu
ish-gray eyes, a small but decidedly
self-assertive nose, the short upper lip
which is supposed to be a hall-mark
of aristocratic lineage, a rather wide
but thin-lipped mouth, and teeth as
small and white and even as two rows
of corn ln the milk.
I notice her teeth particularly after
I have Induced her to do her share of
the talking, for she has a peculiar way
of speaking and smiling without un
closing them at all. Her smile is bright
and frequent, her eyes seem frank, her
lips are mobile and her tongue nimble
enough, but there Is something about
those two firmly meeting rows of Ivory
â¢.vhich contrasts oddly with the expres
sion of open and Ingenuous honesty
which characterizes the rest of her
face.
Innocently confiding as Mrs. Ray
Mills may seem, she is most assuredly
a woman who can keep a secret, wheth
er ii be her own or another's. She will
tell just as much as she chooses and
po more; and, by my faith, I do not be
lieve that all the flames of the inquisi
tion could force her to recant once she
had â right or wrong takeii her stand
en any subject.
We converse of extraneous and Irre
levant matters at first, for believe me
lt is a little difficult to even suggest
personal application of such terms as
"burglary" and "sneak-thieving" to a
woman with the face and manners of
Mrs. Mills, even though she may be
guilty of these crimes in Infinite and
appalling variety, but presently she
herself broaches the subject and be
gins to tell me, quite simply and with
no hint of "playing to the gallery"
whatever, the story of her arrest and
Imprisonment.
She has hardly begun, however, when
there is a stir of new arrivals and the
sound of voices in the low-browed hall
way. A man comes in with a bare
headed, grimy-faced baby of two
years old or so perched on his
shoulder, and going to the desk Is
immediately surrounded by a group
of Interested policemen asking ques
tions, making suggestions and some
of them â those who have young
sters of their own at home, doubtless â
poking friendly fingers and making odd
noises with their mouths at the solemn
eyed and silent Infant, who, evidently
thinking that his adventurous spirit

Mrs. Mills snaps the thread of her
story and leans forward with eagerness
to look at the new comers.
"It's a lost child," she says to me ex
planatorily over the curve of her
shoulder. "Poor little thingâwhat a
fright his mother will have over him!
Some way it seems dreadful to see a
baby in such a place even for a mo
ment, but the other night I had the
loveliest time with one." The small
wanderer and his blue-coated retinue
have moved around the corner out of
our line of vision now, and Mrs. Mills
straightens up and faces me again.
"You see they brought a woman in
here who was so Intoxicated that they
did not dare to leave her baby with her,
so they brought it to the matron's
room and I begged the privilege of car

the dearest little thing, only eight
months old, and it snuggled up to me

A FRIEND OF THE "WOMAN IN BLACK"
GIVES HIS OPINION
** m J ELL, so Mrs. Ray Mills is the mysterious woman in black who has been robbing and terrorizing
\I\I all the fashionable hotels. Poor woman! She has my sympathy, as I have known her for years,
and only about a month ago a friend of mine called my attention to certain queer acts and sayings of
hers and said he thought she was going crazy. I thought so, too. I was not aware that she was a
morphine fiend or a thief, but that would have made no difference, as I knew her in other â knew
her as the lovable wife of a sick and dying man; knew her when poor Harry Mills was failing in health
and had to stop writing for the papers; knew her when she sold her diamonds, her jewelry, her sealskins
and all she possessed so as to care for and nourish her dying husband, and in all my experience I have
never witnessed such tender love as she bestowed on poor Mills. In my life I have seen husbands and
wives who doted on each other, but never have I witnessed such a bond as existed between Mills and his
wife. On one occasion as I was walking on one of our streets with a friend we met Mills. He was
then in the last stages of consumption, and was so ill and weak that he would have fallen had we not
reached him and supported his frail body. Poor fellow! We both knew him in lifeâ knew him as a
boon companion and a jolly good fellow, and many happy hours had we spent together, and now, broken
down and dying, we supported his fragile form and, carefully raising him up, we carried him to his
apartments. As we reached his door he fainted, and as we entered the house his wife saw him. The agon
izing, broken-hearted cry that she uttered still rings in my ears. She thought he was dead, and we could
not convince her otherwise, and at last had to forcibly remove her from the room while a physician re
stored Mills to consciousness. Poor woman! At her husband's death she was penniless and left to strug
gle for herself, and now she is in the gravest trouble and perhaps will be convicted of the many charges
against her. I hope that the Judge and jury who try her will temper justice with mercy and deal as
lightly as possible with her. Sad, indeed, to think that after all she has endured she should finally be
led before the bar of justice as the Mysterious Woman in Black. WILLIAM J. AHERi-J.
brightened her life for a few brief days
ln the pastâ softens the lines and light

pressive silence. And then she winks
hard once or twice and turns to me
again, smiling that queer little set
smile of hers which seems someway to
be a barrier between herself and the
big world which she has found so cruel
since she has had to face It alone.

managed, by injudiciously sTarting a
paper which was not suited to The cli
mate and at the same time investing
in some mining enterprises which were
absorptive rather than productive, to
dispose of their joint capital of $38,000
In a surprisingly brief period of time.
After that he was employed for a time
as city editor of the Fresno Expositor.
and later came with his wife to San
Francisco, where he worked for seven
years, doing the City Hall detail and
other regular reportorial work for one
of the morning dailies. Twenty-one
months ago jovial, generous nnd sun-
hearted Harry Mills died of con
sumption in Los ..Angeles, leaving his
wife penniless and utterly worn but by
the constant and self-forgetful care
with which she had surrounded him
during every moment of his last twelve
months' st_*y pn earth. Dying, lie
thought that If he had left her nothing
else he had left her at least friends in
plenty, for his home had ever been hos
pitable, his nature sympathetic and
companionable, and his heart always
ready to share his purse, be it heavy
or light, with any one who asked a
favor.
Ray Mills had friends enough In
truth while her husband was living and
his love and care were all-sufficient for
her, but to-day how manj* has she?
About the same number, perhaps, that
you or I. dear madame, might find our
selves possessed of under similar cir
cumstances, but. of a surety no more.
She tells her brief history of the past
quietly; almost, indeed, as if she were
speaking of some one else, whose joys
and sorrows were a matter of indiffer
ence to her. Hers has been a hard
school and in it she has learned the
wisdom of reticence and self-repres
sion, but she flashes into a vivid white
flame of anger as she speaks of her
present.
"There never was a woman more
wrongfully and unjustly accused than
I," she declares. "I am surrounded by
a network of lies that, if I were a
weaker person, would almost make me
doubt myself. I am accused of having
stolen over $25,000 worth of diamonds
and jewelry during the past four
months, and during three of those
months I was 111 in bed and the rest
of the time I was making a narrow liv
ing by shampooing and hairdresslng.
If I had been the successful thief which
they say I am I would scarcely work
as hard and live as poorly as I have
done. Now that I am in here"sweep
ing a contemptuous glance around
which seems to take in every bar and
bolt and prisoning horror of the crime
haunted placeâ "people are using me
as a foundation upon which to pile all
manner of falsehoods and wild imag-
Inlngs. Persons whom I do not believe
ever owned a real diamond in their
lives are trying to gain a little cheap
notoriety by declaring that I have
robbed them of small fortunes locked
up in precious stones. It would be
funny, if it were not so terrible, to see
how eager human beings are to rend
each other on occasion, as wolves rend
and devour the weak or wounded ones
of their packs."
She - pauses for a moment, softly
beating her clinched hands together in
her lap, her upper teeth for the instant
overlapping, the lower and gnawing at
the scarlet line of her under lip, and
she does not speak again until she has
gained control of nerves and voice.
Then she reverts to the diamonds once
more.
"If I stole them," she says, "what did
1 do with them? to whom did I sell
them? or where did I hide them? I
could not eat nor drink nor wear them
as they were, most certainly. And if
I were clever enough to make such big
'hauls,' lis they call them, would I con
demn myself to dress like -under
neath, at any rate?" She throws out
a scornful foot in the sheltering shadow
of my chair and whisks her dress-skirt
up sufficiently high for me to see the
cheap cotton, petticoats, the common
stockings and the ready-made and
rather shabby boots which she wears,
and I nod understanding^. The
woman to whom money comes easily
from any source is apt, if she be truly
feminine, to invest a satisfactory per
centage of it in the frills and furbelows,
the beribbor.ed and belaced and silk
en under arrangements, the wearing of
which would make her feel cozlly con
tent even though her gown were of
faded calico. Mrs. Mills has none of
these, and In her eyes this seems con
vincing proof of her impecunioslty.
"Perhaps I spent it for morphine,"
she goes on. "They say I am a 'fiend,'
you know. Look there"â she holds
out both hands to me horizontally and
straight from the shoulderâ "l have

IN THE BOOK WORLD.
y N* "Baldoon" Le Roy Hooker has given
I to the public a book of quiet homely In-
' terest. Quiet, because although there
is a tragic interest in the Incidents re
sulting from George McGarriger's inherit
ance, sufficient to assume the dignity of
a although the romance of the trust
ing widow Cramer and The fortune
hunting Horace Bristol is there to attest
the value of side lights, although there
are loving couples In plenty. "whose rough
pathways are in need of good smoothing,
although there is the haunted house, the
village gossip and the sword-tongued
satirist. Mr. Hooker does not wield a
sensational pen, and the pathos and
strong passion of human life is told with
out exaggeration, as "he has had eyes to
see and ears to hear what was being done
and suffered and enjoyed and said" in
the self-centered little community about
him. Homely because his chief charac
ters are plain and often illiterate people
living remote from commercial and social
centers and hence untouched by metro
polltanlsm. There is a passage some
where which reads: "Impressions made
on the retina are really made on the soul
and the mind becomes what it contem
plates." Where then did Baldoon get its
interesting population? The town was
one of the most forlorn wastes of West
ern Ontario, featureless at all times and
in autumn and spring "a dreary water
scape spreading for miles around, show
ing hither and yon, just the scalp of a
mound that served as a buoy to tell the
proprietoi where his farm waited for
summer to dry it out." In harmony with
the location were the houses, all dull gray
of unpainted wood long exposed to the
weather and "Dod-a-bit," says George
McGarriger, quite the personage of the
book. "if I see what use the Almighty
has fer Baldoon,. onless it's Jest fer the
sake of holdln the world together!" But
the landscape seems not to influence the
characters, for variety Is characteristic of
these people, and George and Mary Mc-
Garriger, Andy Harris, Grlsdale, Dan
Littleton, Delby Cramer and Tom
Brimmlcorn acquaint one with the chief
virtues and vices of humanity. The sim
plicity of the people Is perhaps best re
vealed to the intending reader in the
curiosity which brought them from miles
around to hear from the inmates' own
lips all there was to tell of the ghostly
visitations at Baldoon House. No re

early spring, a black hat trimmed with
white aigrettes, and a white veil a
'wash' one at that, because they are
cheaper. Any one who would call me
a 'woman in black' must be color blind
indeed, and if a woman so dressed
really committed the robberies of which
I am accused, why didn't thej' hunt
her up and arrest her instead of me?"
She is asking questions now â ques
tions which I cannot answer â I
feel that it is time to go. As I rise she
rises also and stands looking at me
half-doubtfully, as if she were longing
to read my thoughts.
"I don't know.'' she says brusquely,
after a fieety second of hesitation,
"whether you think me truthful or a
liar, and I don't much care, for it really
doesn't matter. While 1 know in my

reads: "I am to speak of stories you will

istration of Mayor Harrison, the selection

his re-election is due to the solidarity of
the votes of the vicious elements of the
community. It asks how long the contin

revelation of the corruption of the police

of ill-repute and the like, the workings of

the way for the next election, and all
kinds of corruption never dreamed of by

Many and many of the mothers and
wives have been through lt before.

the girls; misses of the bread and butter
age. in the April weather stage; lt ls new
to them.
Deliriously new. They are tearing emo
tion to tatters in a way that melodrama
would hardly recognize. They are gor
geously intoxicated with laughs and tears
and hugs and hysterics. Behind these ls
a good sound basis of feeling that will
grow more reserved In manner before we
have another war. Our own boys aro
coming home too sound to admit of many
tragedies, and most of the tears are the
kind that femininity revels in. To shed
oceans of tears on a big shoulder just be
cause of those tears you didn't have to
shed; do you fancy It reasonable?
The April weather showed its first
symptoms in the bay parade of Thursday.
I was its barometer on the Sunol. Now
the Sunol carried the Camera Club, a
quiet and demure enough boatload, who
wanted for the most part to take pictures.
But the first Bight of the Sherman was
the signal for a little hysterical gasp.
The girl in Happy blue paced like a bear
ln a cage. The wind played havoc with
her. She was the beauty if the boat, but
she didn't care. She let her hair be blown
out of curl and the picture hat lashed as
the wind listed. She only walked, walked
the deck alone, and she looked as If she
might soon walk trippingly out on the
gray crinkles that lay between her and
the Sherman. There were such a lot of
Ftories in her face; is it impudent to won
der?
The plump one was as calm as you ex
pect plumpness to be until we were near
the transport. Then all of a sudden she
saw him. or she thought she did. which
was quite as gfiod. ["hen the April weath
er broke loose in a great gale. Iler camera
dropped heavily to the bench and she
seized the first flag at md. "Dick! Oh.
Richard! Do you see me?" she asked
through a quarter-mile of scolding wind
and pop-banging guns.
Richard did not reply, or at least we did
not understand him if he did.
"Dick!" she cailed again. "Is your arm
ail right, Dick?"
She was reaching out as far as her
plump little arm would go. and she waved
that bit of stars ar.d stripes as if it stood
for a whole conquering army. Then a
young hopeful, who owned the flag, clam
bered on the bench and watched his
chance. Suddenly both his little hands
clutched for the treasure. She clung to it,
and together they let it drop, strugglingly.
Into the bay.
Not until then did she know just what
she had done.
"Was it your flag, little boy?" she asked
repentantly. He was too grief-stricken to
answer. "I'll get you another oneâ a great
hig one â and a horn, tooâ just as soon as
ever we get back to town," she protested.
"But I had to wave at Dick, because I
knew he'd be looking for me. Don't ever
tell," she added, confidentially, to the re
-
covered hopeful, "but Dick and I have
been engaged three years."
It .vas a secret among half a dozen of
us at that end of the deck.
The tall woman's-club looking girl
heard with scorn and looked upon the
April weather with in l'ni-above-it glance
that struck dumb. But I watched her.
Ten minutes it was, while she grew
stliier and cloudier. Then it came. There
was a gulp and down went her head on
the next girl's shoulder, and off bobbed
the glasses and the instructive look was
cast away. It was good to see her try
and wave and laugh and scream like the
rest of them. Don't be afraid. The clubs
may do their worst, but they can't quite
make over our girls after all.
All of this, as I told you, was prelim
inaryâthe symptoms of what broke out
fully on Friday. When I reached Union
depot, long before the breakfast hour, I

yOU'RE under arrest," said the cus-
toms officer. "But I'm over the
Bide," I replied, and then I smiled
appreciation of my power of re-
partee. "You'll find this no laugh-
ing matter," continued the guardian of
our country's commerce. "You have vio
lated the law and my dignity and me and
the United States is goln' to make it hot
for you."
Possibly the law had been violated, but
not by me. I was as innocent of any
wrong Intent as the babe unborn. I had
gone out to see "Big" Ben Clancy,
"Chaps," "Cannon Bail" Jack Switzer.
"The Pirate" McQueeny, "The Ratters"
and about a thousand other fellows on
the big transport Sherman before the
quarantine officer had passed on her.
Louis Honig and Billy Britt had gone
with me, and the three of us had mounted
the rope ladder which hung over tlie
ship's side in order to talk with our
friends.
The Swede who had rowed us over
looked up at one of the vessel's port
holes, and perceiving a copper colored
Filipino there making gorgon's eyes at him
had retreated to the tug in great disorder,
leaving his freight hanging between wind
and water like three barnacles on a
whitewashed pile.
The boys on deck seeing our position,
reached out and yanked us on board.
Britt and Honig went over the Bide,
helped by strong hands on their coat
collars. I was pulled through a port and
arrived inside the transport, not because
I wished to offend the awful dignity that
doth hedge our customs round, but be
cause half a dozen soldiers had hold of
my ankles and because my legs are
rather firmly attached to my body. It
took me several minutes to catch my
breath after I stood upon l_he deck. It
took the officer about half that time to
catch me. Subsequently he lost me Just
about as rapidly.
"You are under arrest," he reiterated,
"and you must come with me."
I fastened my coat by the only button
that my passage through the port had
left upon it. and with firm tread and
proudly erect head I told my captor I
was ready and bade him lead the way.
He took me to the quarterdeck
where an officer attired in much gold lace
and some whiskers told me that I was
a prisoner, but that I would be allowed
the freedom of the ship If I did not try
to escape that evening. I looked at the
lights of the Cliff House that twinkled
like little stars in the dim distance and
at the great stretch of black water that
intervened, and I assured the officer that
I would make no attempt to escape that
evening. On that assurance he removed
my guard and told me I might follow my
Inclinations anywhere save over the sides
of the vessel.
During all this time the officers of the
California Regiment had held aloof, not
daring to break In upon the examination
of a prisoner. As soon, however, as I
had been released on parole they crowded
around to offer their sympathy and to in
quire Into the causes which had led to my
arrest. I told them, and their Indignation
knew no bounds. It was chiefly directed
against the boatman who had deserted
my companions and myself at the ship's
side, and it would have fared ill .with the
heartless Swede if those stern veterans
could have laid hands on him at that
moment.
Notwithstanding the unfortunate cir
cumstances which had brought me to my
present pass â circumstances over which I
had no controlâ yet my position was one
thought the hysterics must have used
themselves up, but not so. The girls
seemed quiet enough then, but i' was
only a lull. When the hungry, tired, lov
ing crowd of boys was turned loose In
the big reception room I found that as
barometer I was to learn what it really
meant to be busy.
Up flew the record one second to mark
the joyfullest squeeze that Grade could
squeeze. Down it fell the next, when
M.-udie burst forth in an ocean of tears
that might have floated the Sherman.
Both meant the sameâ that the dearest
boy was home again.
I wonder if there is a boy in that regi
ment who hasn't a sweetheart waiting. I
d..n't believe it. Some of them have sever
al, and s:.ow a diplomacy in the manage
ment thereof worthy their position.
But of all the skill in these delicate
matters that I saw nothing surpassed the
frankness with which one big brown hero
disposed of his left arm around a pink
girl, his right around a blue one, and
of deep disgrace, and I could not but feel
it keenly. The officers themselves per-
ceived this, and though they attempted
to console me. they recognized that our
relative positions made the situation one
of great delicacy.
The stigma of crime had been placed
upon me, and their silent grief was pitiful
to witness. The speeches of condolence
gradually died away and we stood there
In the pale moonlight a sad and silent

every moment, and something had to be

just one bottle of whisky on the entire
ship. It belongs to me. Let's go and have
a drink." It was a most opportune mvi
tation, and the unanimous alacrity with
which it was accepted showed how eager
the assemblage was to seize upon any
excuse which would serve to dispel the
awkwardness of the meeting.
As soon as the kindly warmth of the
bottle's contents had made itself felt all
hands ripened up a bit, and I began to
get some Information concerning my com
panions in crime, Britt and Honig. Honig
had been seen to steal below, like a dark
ghost of the mist. Billy had not been seen
at all, but as one of the officers said some-
thing of a shooting star I imagined it must
have been Britt's parti-colored shirt and
torrid necktie that flashed In the moon
light as he went flying over the rail.
I determined to find out, and excusing
myself started on a hunt through the ship.
Down below In the steerage I found Honig
hiding under a bunk and consoling himself
with a cup of coffee and a sandwich,
which a kind steward had surreptitiously
smuggled Into him.
Honig tremblingly asked me what was
going to be done with him. Upon my an-
swering that nothing more serious would
be done than to place him under arrest he
took heart of grace and came forth from
his hiding place. He had seen nothing of
Brltt, so I left him, to search for Willie
ln other places.
I left the aristocratic precincts of the
commissioned officers and started forward
among the men. The minute I stepped
into their quarters I experienced a greet-
ing that would atone for a far worse mis-
fortune than Imprisonment by the Cus-
tom-house authorities. The men, whom I
had last seen ln Luzon, crowded around
me and fairly wrung my hand off with
the vigor of their salutations. Questions
flew thick and fast, and I had as many to
ask as I had to reply to.
Regimental and company matters were
recounted and discussed with an Interest
which could not possibly be felt, or even
understood, by one who had not tasted of
the life himself and there learned to feel,
not for the men, but with them.
I don't know why It Is, possibly because
the only station I ever occupied ln Uncle
Sam's service was the most humble he has
to offer, but my affection is all for the
man who packs the gun. The officers
who command them are good men, but
the fellow whose Joys and sorrows, pleas
ures and privations, hopes and disappoint
ments, claim my sympathy, and get It, is
the fellow who In demonstrations, such as
those this past week has seen, shines only
in the aggregateâ the fellow who has all
the worst of It at the front and who is

But to my story. The boys crowded
around me, and again and again I was
forced to answer anxious inquiries after
relatives and friends and to repeat every
detail of the grand reception that awaited
the regiment. They did not seem to un
derstand it. They knew they had done
their duty, but they had been too modest
to expect any such ovation as I pictured
to them. One fellow expressed the general
feeling ln the following sentence: "We
knew the people would be glad to get us
home," he said. "But. hâ l, we never
thought the killing of a few niggers and
greasers was going to create such excite
ment. However, If the people delight to
so honor us we fully appreciate the com
pliment and will do our best to show
them so." This sentence Is repeated as
nearly word for word as memory will per
mit.
As soon, as the boys' curiosity had been
In a measure satisfied they began to an
swer a few of my questions and I learned
of what had been going on In the Phil
ippines. From the Information I thus
gleaned I am satisfied that no reception
was too good for the California volun
teers.
While we were still conversing below

also care a great deal about what they

studying about them.
Now and then the roof rang with a
shriek that meant found. A tall, whole
some girl wearing the Red Cross badge
made her escape from the breakfast room,
where she had been waiting at table.
She came out through the crowd, apron
flying, her arms loaded with wreaths.
Somehow she had caught a glimpse of
him through the bars, and she ran
screaming and waving through the room.
It was a good, healthy sight to see as
she fell on that plucky brother's neck,
and there wasn't a tear In all her wel

done properly, the plucky brother wept
a little weep on his own behalf. Which
likewise was a good, healthy sight to see.

stamped off as he put his hand over the
rail. We carefully searched or the
piece, but it was lost amid (che crowd.
As .a matter of fact the action of the
quartermaster was a piece of unwarrant
ed brutality. He could easily have kept
the reporter off without employing any
such violent means.
The excitement attending the repulse of
the Chronicle boarding party subsiding,
Britt was discovered dressed In a soldier's
uniform. He resisted all importunities to
take It off until he was told that It would
cost him five years on Alcatraz If one of
the military officers caught him in his
borrowed plumes. Then the uniform came
off so quickly that for very modesty one
of the men was forced to wrap him tem
porarily in a couple of old sacks.
Leaving Billy to attend to his toilet I
again went aft. There I found that Ho
nig. who is a lawyer as well as a reporter,
had so tangled up In argument the man
by whom he had been placed under ar
rest that the fellow had actually been
brought to believe that he and not Ho
nig was the person under restraint. As
this was a very satisfactory arrange
ment he was not undeceived up to. the

doubt that when he reads this article
he will receive the first Intimation of his
mistake.

Never having heard most probably of
the two gentlemen previously mention
ed, as being out of his class ln the rival
line, Henry cannot, even by those most
envious of his present glory, be accused
of knowingly putting upon the stage of
actual existence a plagiarism of the
special "turns" which gained those
mythical personages their wide renown.
Like them, however, he has engaged In
single combat with a fierce and raging
specimen of the bovine species, and
with his good right arm, assisted per
haps somewhat by his left, has gained
a victory over his four-footed aotago
neck. And the big sisterly girl in blue
forgot that the much-received darling had
not yet had a single bite, and fell to pat-
ting him on his blessed backâ moth-
erly, go-to-sleep pats, that made eating a
choky risk. The little blue-gowned girl
with a pompadour for an Empress was
the best of all.
"You don't know how men are," she ex-
plained to some colleagues, with the ex
perience of many years in her voice. "Men
don't think kisses are a patch on bread
and butter until after they've finished the
bread and butter." ' Whereupon she set an
object lesson that made itself good for a
table length. She fed them, and fed them
again, and there wasn't a hungry man
left within reach of her plates of chicken
and peas.
Privileged sisters and sweethearts In
side the bars of the east nave leaned over
the backs of their heroes' chairs or sat
beside them at the loaded tables. There
was a little shirt-walsted one I watched
who was wise enough to tell home stories
while her hero enjoyed his breakfast, and
the stories besides. There was one less
wise who asked questions that it starved
a man to keep answered, and there were
a host of girls, simply girls, who both told
and questioned in such a torrent of words
and laughs and tears that it didn't much
matter whether the stories were heard or
the questions answered.
There was a Gladys I Saw who tried
hard to be conventional. Which, as she
soon found, was the most unconventional
thing she could do. "Do explain the po
litical relation!, in' the Philippines," she
began properly then wound up with,
"Oh, I don't care a button about them,
but, Jackie, do you know, the parrot has
learned a bugle call."
The breakfast with its big. splendid, con
clusive cheers over there was a better
Notwithstanding the heinous offense of
which we had been guilty both the of
ficers of the ship and the oflicers of the
regiment did all that lay in their power
to make our forced detention pleasant as
possible. Each of us had the choice of a
dozen beds to sleep In, cigars, cigarettes,
coffee, and. in fact, everything that they
could offer was placed before us and we
settled down to tell them the news of the
world from which they had been so long
separated.
We were getting along in fine shape.
The cabin was filling up with tobacco
smoke, through which jest and stories
were flying thick and fast, when we were
again interrupted. This time it was an
Examiner launch loaded with Alice Rix,
reporters and a dog. .
They all wanted to come right on board
and pleaded for recognition of passes
which they claimed they had from all
sorts and conditions of people in all kinds
and classes of authoritative positions.
But it was no go.
They were forced to content themselves
with talking through a megaphone, ask
ing questions which no one on board un
derstood and receiving replies which were
not distinct enough to be intelligible.
After a while they became tired and
went home. Then the Chronicle made
another try. This time it was Mabel
Craft who appeared. She stood on the
tug's deck and tried to convince the trans
port's officers that by allowing a repre
sentative of her paper on board they
would be conferring a personal favor on
Major General Shatter. They replied that
nothing would give them greater satis
faction than to put the general under an
obligation, and lf the party would repeat
nist, the recital of which will long inter
est the dwellers and workers around
our wharves.
The bull in question was not a
specially large one, but he was possess
ed of a great deal of stubbornness and
was of a most excitable temperament.
Determining in his own heart that life
on the ocean wave was not desirable
for him, he decided not to board the
tug upon which Henry was helping to
load his companions ln misery on their
way to the Brunswick, but instead to
seek the bosky groves of East street
and rest beneath the shade of the trees
thoughtfully planted there some time
since by a nature-loving Harbor Com
mission. v/j-* *:
Up the wharf he started, and his gen
tle amble became a wild and maddened
gallop as the persons whom he met
Jointly and severally proceeded to ob
chance for more comfortable affection
outside the east nave again. Many boys
had 'left their best beloved_outside the
bars when they went in to a breakfast
that couldn't quite make up even by Its
groaning tables for the attractive outside.
There was a long blessed hour for nice
little leave-takingsâ leave-takings that
meant how-dye-do again in no time, and
the roof of San Francisco over both
heads. The Presidio is nearer than Ma
nila.
The boys looked as placid and Jovial
after the feast as private citizens look,
and the tears had for the most part wept
themselves out. The boys beamed under
or over wreaths, and the happiest girls in'
San Francisco leaned on their arms or
clung to their shoulders while they prom-
enaded.
There was a certain society favorite
whose tawny curls alone appeared above
a mass of white sweet peas and silk
waists and golf capes. There was a less
known soldier in another corner with only
one little bunch of pink rosebuds and one
small damsel that nobody ln particular
knew. And they were both entirely sat
isfied so far as the most critical observer
could see.
In days when football men are back
numbers and matinee idols are out of
date; when, in short, there is nothing ln
the masculine line strictly in it except the
sign of our army; In these days there are
overtures made that belong to leap year
alone. But it is entirely the thing to be
as attentive as one likes to a returning
hero, and the Islands of the far East (or
Is lt West?) do not furnish maidens that
come in the way of home ties.
So it is, for the most part, a satisfying
enough home coming on both sides. I
might think it was always so If I didn't
remember the case of the measurer of rib
bons. And even then I wondered lf the
its visit on the morrow, after the doctor
had made his visit, it would be most cor
dially received. Then they also went
home.
As a matter of fact, the whole evening
was passed in hailing newspaper boats
and telling them how sorry we were that
they could not get what they had come
after. One by one the soldiers went below,
little by little the crowd on deck disap
peared,* and finally, when all save the
sentries had gone to rest, we three prison
ers sought the seclusion of the quarters
that had been assigned to us by the
courtesy of the officers and retired.
I had the offer of an unoccupied cabin,
but preferred to accept an invitation of
Lieutenant Curzons, the regimental ad
jutant, to bunk in his room. In the highly
nervous state into which I had been
thrown by my arrest bunking alone was
too suggestive of solitary confinement.
I slept but a few short hours, but in that
time I experienced more real agony than
is generally encompassed in a long life.
I had dreamsâ horrid dreams. They were
filled with visions of custom-house officers
and other uncanny things, and I suffered
intensely.
Early in the morning I arose and started
to look about the ship. Going forward I
found all the boys eating fruit and read
ing the news. The Call's boat had been
out before sunrise and supplied all hands
with papers and delicacies. The other
papers sent out boats some hours later.
As soon as it became perfectly light
crafts of ah sorts and sizes began to come
out, and soon the boys were recognizing
familiar faces and receiving greetings
from loved ones whom they had not seen
for the last fifteen months.
Among the swarm of tugs that circled
us around was a white one commanded
by an officer whose natural fierceness of
expression was considerably increased by
an enormous pair of mustachios that
adorned (?) his upper lip. This gentleman,
lately attached to a Polar relief expedi
tion but now in command of a customs
tug, brought off another officer, who lis
tened to the report of our guard and then
doubled the one on Honig. Our new
captor was not the real thing, but he was
more heavily plated than the one who had
originally arrested us, and he told us that
we were to be handed over to the doctor,
who would act as a sort of preliminary
court to sit on our case. Naturally this
Increased our uneasiness. It is bad enough
to be sat upon by any one, but by a
doctor!
A little before noon the transport
weighed anchor and started toward the
city. Out of the Golden Gate to meet her
there came such a procession of decorated
craft that one would not find It hard to
deceive himself into the belief that he ha**.
been whisked back to the days when Ven
etian splendor was the glory of the seas
and he was witnessing the nuptial cere
monies of the Adriatic.
Just after we entered the heads the doc-
ject to his plans. Up East street he
turned, and just then Henry realized
that something had happened, and, in
the vernacular of the front, "got a wig
gle on." He cleared the wharf in four
bounds and got abreast of the bull In
two more. Then he got a left hook on
the brute's spreading horns and trot
ted along beside him until he came to
a place where, three or four paving
stones being missing, . there was a
chance to stick his toes into terra
firma and make an anchor of himself
for the queer craft he was trying to
get command of. He didn't stick them
quite far enough, however, for the ani
mal dragged him up and sailed along
a little further until they came to an
other hole in the pavement, and here
Henry was more successful. He didn't
break the creature's neck, but he came
pretty near cracking it. and for a few
moments there was an energetic and
spirited tug-of-war between man and
beast, during which bets were even
among the wildly interested onlookers.
Every muscle in the sailor's body was
brown jacket wouldn't finally cut him
out.
There was a girl on the boat Thursday
that I noticed. She had large, well-gloved
hands and smoothly knotted hair. She
was the kind of girl who wears low heels
and a sailor hat conspicuous neither for
very old nor very new shape. She was
cool as a cucumber on the boat; so cool
that I fancied she merely wanted a snap
shot of the transport.
It was a minute before we steamed Into
Washington street wharf that I caught
sight of the yellow flurry of her relative's
badge. "You have somebody on board?"
I asked.
"Yes," she answered; "a brother." She
was as cool as ever, but her eyes shone.
What had there been to have hysterics
over when there was no way of reaching
him? But I saw her at Union depot on
Friday, and from the look of the thing
I didn't believe that brother had one whit
less of a reception for all that good check
rein on self.
The whole affair this week has been
such a patchwork of all the things we
feelâ love and fear and hope and comedy
and tragedy. There are so many little
sights on which hinge so much. There
was more pathos than is quite easy with
out a handkerchief in the way the girl in
the blue silk waist clung to her great
Adonis that once was; poor scarred sol
dier that has returned to her, branded
with the sign of dread disease. And the
woman who stood back against the brass
bars and watched from under her black
veil; watched those who went to meet
somebody. She was alone. Those who
saw her standing there will not forget.

tor came on board. He was made ac
quainted with our apprehension and we
were summoned before him. After read
ing us a caustic lecture on the evil we
had done he stood us in front of him
and sized us up. As a result of his ex-
amination our guards were again
changed. One was put over Honig and
myself and a special man was detailed
to watch over Billy. They all had or-
ders not to allow us out "of sight for a
moment. This readjustment rather hurt
Honig and myself. Billy was a little
bit of a fellow and we did not see why
a special guard should be detailed to
watch him while a single man waa
deemed sufficient to take care of both
of us.
Then we got into trouble between our-
selves. This single espionage racket had
converted us into sort of legal Siamese
twins. Whatever one of us wished to do
both had to do and wherever one of us
wished to go there the other had to fol
low. The guard was willing to accom-
pany us to any part of the ship, but he
insisted we should not separate. Now
this occasioned all sorts of lllfeellng be
tween us.
Honig and myself are dissimilar In every
way and our tastes are as opposite as
our appearances. If I wanted to look at
the city front it was a cinch that Honig
would want to gaze at Alcatraz, and if
Honig wanted to flirt with some one over
the bow I would have a particular friend
in one of the boats astern.
Finally we came to an arrangement by
which we took turn about, each man be-
ing the elder twin for half an hour, then
giving was* to the other. This agreement
worked like a charm and the guard, who
had been losing flesh trying to keep us
both together, had a chance to get a little
rest.
When the vessel came to an anchor a
tug bearing our superiors came alongside
and a message was sent up to us to losa
the guard and come down on board.
We told the boys what was wanted and
they stood in with us nobly. Getting
around our patrol they so mixed him up
among themselves that we had a chance
to slip away. I got on to the tug by the
help of a porthole which a couple of sol
diers held open while I slid down a rope
which a friendly coalpasser supplied me
with. Honig was there when I arrived
and Britt, losing his custodian through
the assistance of the Rafters, slid down
from the stern of the transport on a tug's
"flagpole. Even there he beat us on the
honor end of it. The pole broke and he
descended In a most sensational manner
right in the midst of a circle of ladles
seated on the tug's deck. The tug at
once steamed off and we were again free
men.
Honig and myself were much relieved at
our escape, but we could not help wishing
we had chosen the flagpole.
tried and twisted to the utmost, every
nerve was tense. He had entered upon
an unequal contest, but, having en
tered, his stout heart would not let him
retreat. The bull gathered its forces
for one supreme effort and sprang fran
tically forward. Peterson's legs stiff
ened until they seemed like twin masts
and he sat his nearly three hundred
pounds of individuality back on the at
mosphere and wished, for the moment,
that he were five hundred pounds heav
ier. But he did not need to be. Intel
ligently directed human strength proved
more than a match for blind brute
force. The shock of suddenly arrested
motion followed that last crazed leap
-for liberty, and then with a quick
bending of the giant form beside him
the bull's head was forced down be
tween his quivering forelegs; then
those forelegs wavered and bent, and
prone upon the ground lay . the con
quered beast, with Peterson of the
Brunswick sitting conqueror astride
his neck.

ointment for banishing these little black
spots' ls made of flowers of sulphur, one
teaspoonful; rosewater, one pint; gly

menu was varied; and only in two in*
stances did the food' show the greasir.ess

usual American array of knives and forks
there was a tier of four plates at each
seat. On the top and smallest plate were
crossed a silver knife and fork, and at the
side of the tier was a well laundered rap

The first course, served by tall Russian
waiters in white suits, ' consisted of a
slice of tasty tongue with thin wafers ot

you wish them permanently removed,

again. Nothing has yet been discovered
that will dissolve or kill the hair-roots.
The electrical treatment may have to be

knick-knacks. The tea was served in the
orthodox Russian style in tumblers. The*
waiters poured first an inch of tea, then
filled up with hot water, and the passen
ger used cube sugar and sliced lemon to
taste. The breakfast table was set as for
supper except that a standard dish heaped
with Russian candies wrapped in silver
and oil paper stood at each end of the
table. The first course of our first break

effect. I am inclined to think the little
hairs would have sprouted anyway. How
ever, lf you feel uneasy about lt then use
a cream that contains neither one of these
ingredients. I think you will find the
almond cream more satisfactory than the
other one you mention. If you would pre
fer not to use glycerin omit it. and use
in its place another half ounce of almond
oil. That will make three ounces of the
oil in all. The peroxide of hydrogen
merely bleaches the halra. I doubt lf
cow's cream will aid very materially In
eradicating wrinkles, but it is very soft
ening. You can add a little benzoin to it
if you wleh, not more than ten drops to a
glass of cream, I should say. The lotion
recommended for the hands has such a
very small proportion of glycerin in It
that you need not fear its turning the skin
black or in any way injuring it. Your

proportions called for, else the â ' powder
would not have roughened your face. If

add the liquid all at once immediately
upon removing the other ingredients from
the heat and then beat with an eggbeater
until cold? That is what you should have
done. Thirty-eight drops of benzoin Is al

Fill an earthen jar with nice, firm
mushrooms and sprinkle over them half
a pound of salt, cover well and let stand
twenty-four hours. Then put the Jar in a
medium 'oven for an hour. Strain off the

3*ruit Punches,
Fruit punches are easily made in this,
the season for ripe fruits. They are
wholesome, digestible and appetizing, for
luncheon they may be served for dessert
and lor dinner in place of the oyster
cocktail. â¢ -. *â¢â .â  - ,
Raspberry Punchâ This is also very de
licious made in exactly the same man
ner with the same proportions of fruit
juice, water and sugar. The iuice of two
lemons should, however be added, ana
for a earnish stir in blanched almonds
with the beaten white of an egg. It should
be served in champagne glasses, and v, hen
used as i, dessert it is very nice to have
small triangles of angels' food colored to
the same shade a* the punch.
Cherry Punch-Take one and one-half
pints of cherry juice, one-half pint of
water three-fourths of a pound of sugar,
together with the juice of one lemon an
ounce of candied cherries and the white
of an egg. The cherries should be well
jammed together, and some of the pits
broken in order to get a little of the bit
ter flavor of the nut. The sugar should
then he added and the whole brought to
a boiling point. Strain and add the water.
Put the whoie into an ice cream freezer,
and after it is frozen stir in the beaten
white of an egg and the candied cherries.
Blackberry Punchâ The fruit should be
thoroughly cooked ln order to bring out
the brilliant color. When properly made
it is exceedingly rich and beautiful ln
color, but is apt to be a little dull If tak
en off the stove too quickly. The Ju'.co
of one lemon should be added in order to
give It the requisite tang. White currants
as a garnish give a very pretty effect in
contrast to deep red. "Never om!t the
beaten white of an egg. To two quarts of
berries add three cups of water and one
and one-half cups of sugar. Mash the
fruit and sugar together and let tt stand
two hours, then add water and boll twen
ty minutes, strnln. and when cool, freeze.
Orange Punchâ Take one and one-half
pints of clear Juice, add to lt one-half pint
of water, and dissolve in It three-fourths
of a pound of finely -powdered sug'ir.
After freezing, add in the usual manner
the beaten white of an egg; sliced ba
nanas may be suggested as a crarnlsh.
Lemon punch Is made In exactly the same
way, except that lt requires a full pound
of surar.

Opafo for jCuck.
The opal ls no longer considered of evil
omen by those who are'tne best Informed.
It has become popular to believe that in
stead of 111 luck the opal carries with It
the best luck and happiness in its highest
form. Indeed, it is now. considered the
token of mutual love, burning brightly in
all the colors of the rainbow. It ls the
gift of lover to sweetheart, the symbol
of an eternal devotion, and of so devoted
a character as to- show Itself In constant
and fiery flashes of beautiful color. .
To emphasize this romantic Idea the
opal ls now cut In the form of a heart.
and the sentiment of a heart on fire with
love is one which appeals to all lovers.
This heart, when small enough, is set in
a ring, but Australian opals have recently
been imported of sufficient size to permit
of their being used in a simple gold frame
as a pendant for the lorgnette chain.
These opal hearts are also used for the
centers of brooches.

Dave Won Ever Seen a Human Ifncubator?
-1
I AYE seen a human Incubator.
I discovered it ln the full tide of
successful and glorious operation
ln a nlpa hut hidden ln a bamboo
thicket near Kallbuyo Towers, beyond
La Caridad. and I kept careful daily
watch of It until, its tale of days being
numbered, it delivered to the world over
two dozen of the prettiest and fluffiest
and brightest-eyed little chicks imagin
able.
The day that I first beheld thisâ to
me â novel application of human forces
to distinctively gallinaceous ends was
a notably hot one even for Luzon. The
sky itself seemed almost like the radi
ating roof of a superheated furnace,
and no one save a somewhat foolhardy
and extremely adventurous American
soldier would have even thought of
stirring out from under the grateful
shadow of roof or awning or protect
ing tent.
As, however, it was far too hot to
expect to be even partly comfortable
anywhere, and the monotony of camp
life had become almost unbearable,
Lieutenant George N. Wolf, ordnance
officer of the Oregon regiment, deter
mined, together with myself, to take a
seven-mile ride under those biasing
heavens on an errand partly explora
tive and partly of practical charity.
We had heard the day previous
through one of the native boys that
there was great suffering among the
fisher people down by the Towers be
cause since the Spanish had been driven
away there had been little or no sale
for their only stock in trade. Even had
they possessed their usual small means
it would have been difficult If not im
possible for them to have procured suf
ficient quantities of really nourishing
food to supply their demand, since all
the caraboa, or water buffaloesâ the
mainstay of the Islands ln the way of
low-priced meatâ had been secured for
the use of the Filipino army, and chick-
ens â the other chief dependence of the
people â were simply not to be thought
of at all by persons who were not able
and willing to pay at least ?2 for even
the scrawniest kind of an underfed hen.
It was not that chickens were not plen
tiful enjough to be more easily secured,
but a few enterprising and hard
hearted natives had managed to corner
the supply, with the result that their
poorer countrymen were reduced to
most desperate straits through their In
strumentality. A special element of
wretchedness was added to the situa
STRANGE FEATURES OF THE MOST REMARKABLE LAKE IN CALIFORNIA
BY 11. W. FAIRBANK.
ON the eastern side of the Sierras
and extending close up under
them is the most remarkable
lake in California. While on the
east the snowy peaks tower
above lt, on the northwest and south it
Is bounded by the desert sands of the
Basin area.
Tear after year the mountain streams
pour into the lake and although it has
no outlet it never rises or falls more
than a few feet. It is intensely alka
line and saline. Though only about
twelve miles ln its greatest dimension
the water contains enough salts of
various kinds to supply the world for
generations. For Instance, there are
ninety-two million tons of soda, eigh
ty-six million tons of salt, forty-seven
tlon through the fact that having been
because of their dire poverty restricted
almost exclusively to a flsh diet, the
beach people had become afflicted with
most painful cutaneous eruptions which
had developed in many cases into a
general disease affecting the whole
physical structure.
Loading ourselves with a number of
cans of beef and a half-dozen large
pasteboard boxes of hardtack, the lieu
tenant and I started on our torrid jour
ney, resting for a brief time at La Carl
dad, which seemed utterly deserted un
der that scorching sun, every one hav
ing fled to cover, there to remain until
cooler eventide, and then pushed on
through a bamboo thicket to the beach
skirting that portion of Manila Bay.
Alone on the sands we found one old
woman digging in the sand with her
clawlike fingers for shell flsh, which she
eagerly devoured as soon as found. The
voracity with which she disposed of a
cracker which we experimentally threw
to her showed that anything made of
flour was a heavenly luxury in her es
timation. We gave her as many as we
thought it would be prudent for her to
eat, and she disposed of every crumb of
them without a word or even a gesture
of thanks; but before she shuffled out
of sight into the bamboo Jungle she
uttered a singular cry, which brought
around us as by magic a small army ox
Filipino children.
Half-clothed and far more than half
starved they all were, yellow ln color
and sunken of cheeks, with stick-like
arms and legs, gnarled lumps of knees
and elbows, and abnormally large ab
domens. Boys there were wearing
nothing but breech-cloths, girls clad
with a flutter of rags as a "salsa, " and
little bony toddlers clad only with the
sunshine. There were luminous eyes
gleaming all around -wolfish-looking
eyes that glared at us out of scores of
wan little faces heart-breaking in their
pathos of childish and unmerited mis
ery.
My friend and I stood back to back
and threw handfuls of pieces of cracker
into the famished crowd, being obliged,
however, to interfere occasionally, and
often with considerable force, to pre-

vent the comparatively strong from
triumphing over and defrauding their
weaker companions. As our store of
hardtack grew lower I opened some of
the cans of beef and, cutting thetr con
tents into small* pieces, distributed
them, one to each of the little ones, tell
ing them at the same time that this
was the end of their day's feast and
that their clamorous presence was no
longer desirable to us.
They disappeared as magically as
they had burst upon oqr vision, melt
ing into the wall of green behind us al
million tons of sulphate of soda and ten
million tons of chloride of potassium.
With the water so rich in these de
structive salts it ls strange that any
thing can live in it, but nevertheless
it does support several kinds of animal
life. There ls a little crustacean, half
an inch long, and resembling a shrimp,
with which the water is so filled that as
they swim about here and there they
make the water seem almost alive.
There is a fly also which seems to be
unaffected by the water even if sub
merged in it. The countless numbers
of these insects fairly blacken the
sand ln many places. There is also an
insect which In the early summer lays
its eggs in the water, and toward fall
they hatch out in immense numbers.
These worm-like creatures wash up on
the shore in great windrows, and if left
soon decay and pollute the air. How
ever, this seldom happens, for the In
most like shadows. One little girl, a
tin. id creature with a pair of the most
mournful eyes that. I ever saw, had
particularly attracted our attention by
the fact that although she hid fought
valiantly with her small comrades to
secure even rather more than her share
of the provisions we had brought, she
had eaten not even a crumb of it all,
but had stored It in her "salsa." It
seemed certain that she was Intending
to share her treasure with some one, or
else intended to enjoy a much too large
meal at her leisure and in peace. To
dians since time immorlal have known
the food value of these larval Insects
and come from far and near to gather
them. They are collected in the great
baskets which the squaws carry on
their backs, are dried and then stored
for winter
On a morning after a storm the white
foam may be seen In great masses
floating upon the water, reminding one
forcibly of the Icebergs of the north.
Should a light breeze arise they pre

see which was the case the lieutenant
and I quietly followed her as she sadly
wandered away, and discovered that
her destination was a hut sheltered by
the tali bamboo.
Inside the hut there was absolutely
nothing save a few rude implements
used for cooking, probably, in happier
days, and at one side a sort of raised
platform of bamboo upon which lay a
gaunt old woman, packed, apparently,
in very dirty cotton batting. Cozlly
nestled in this soft material, close
against and between her arms and body
float hither and thither over the water.
There are other strange features about
the lake. There are springs scattered
over Its bottom, and many of these,
which contain lime In solution, have
built up fantastic towers, some of
which extend above the water. From
one the water flows like the stream
from a circular fountain running out
over the edges of the basin.
High above the present level of the
water may be seen the shores of the
old lake which existed here during the
and in her still luxuriant but wildly dis
heveled hair, were nearly three dozen
hens' eggs. The poor old woman, hav
ing outlived her usefulness ln other
ways, had been metamorphosed Into an
Incubator, and most conscientiously
was she performing her arduous duties.
She lay perfectly motionless as her
young grandchild â who had acted the
part of Elijah's ravensâ stood on tiptoe
beside her and fed her slowly with
fragments of meat and cracker; and
she seemed almost afraid to speak, or
even chew, lest she should break the
glacial period. There are two large
Islands in the lake and upon them the
foot of man Is seldom planted, for
though the Indians gather- about the
shores they cannot be persuaded to
cross the water and no canoe ever ruf
fled its surface. A little scow, leaky
and hard to row, was the only avail
able kind of boat and, choosing a quiet
morning, for fear it would not stand
the fierce afternoon winds, we ventured
out to the Islands ln it. Strange islands
indeed we found them to be. One is dark
fragile treasures committed to her
charge.*
From that day George and I made
this living incubator our special chargo
and saw to it that neither she nor her
young attendant lacked for food. We
made frequent visits to the solitary hut
and kept close tvatch not only of the
condition of the old woman but of the
eggs, concerning which we felt a special
and solicitous curiosity. It was our
good fortune to be present when the
hatching time arrived, and the odd
sight it was to see the tiny chickens
and forbidding and formed entirely of
lava, which looks as if It had but yes
terday been lifted above the water.
Jagged lava surrounds a black volcanic
cone of very recent origin. On the older
lava there are a few bushes and a
small flock of goats manage to eke out
an existence.
The larger island Is partly volcanic
and partly formed of clay beds. Its
surface is light in color and almost free
from vegetation. On the south side of
this island, which' ls called by the In-
dlans Paoha, is a considerable area
permeated by the heat of the subter
ranean fires which still smolder there.
The rocks are hot under foot and from
crevices here and there issue jets of
steam or hot vapors. On a cold morn
ing a column of steam can be distinct
ly seen from the mainland six miles
away.

many people In the party? Are they all Americans? Oh, I suppose it wiu
be quite right. Your Minister in Constantinople will arrange that .<-*esiljr,
Where did you say? At NikopoUs? Well, we conclude that the Turks will

garrison at Prevaaa, by the way, may make s deal of trouble Remember
Plevna"
"Exactly how fax la lt to NlkopoUa?" asked Coleman.
"Oh. I think it ls about thirty kilometers," replied the other. ' There
1* a good military road as soon as you cross the Louros River. I've got
the map of the Austrian general staff. Would you like to look at it . '
Coleman studied the map, speeding with his eye rapidly to and fro
betweeii Arta and NikopoUs. To him it was merely a brown lithograph of
mystery, but he could study the distances.
He had received a cordial invitation from the commander of the cav
alry to go with him for another ride into Turkey, and he Inclined to be
lieve that his project would be furthered lf he stuck close to the -avairy*
So he rode back to the cavalry camp and went peacefully to sleep on the
6od. He awoke in the morning with chattering teeth to find his dragoman
saying that the major had unaccountably withdrawn his loan of tha two
troop horsee. Coleman of course Immediately said to himself that the
dragoman was lying again In order to prevent another expedition into
ominous Turkey, but after all if the commander of the cavalry' had sud
denly turned the light of his favor from the correspondent it was only a
proceeding consistent with the nature which Coleman now though: he was
beginning to discern, a nature which can never think twice in the same
place, a gaseous mind which drifts, dissolves, combines, vanishes w'*h the
ability cf an aerial thing until the man of the north feels that *** .ah'
clutches lt with full knowledge of his senses he ls only the vjctn : ,f his
ardent Imagination. It ls tbe difference ln standards, in creeds, which is
the more luminous when men call out that they are all alike.
So Coleman ar.d his dragoman loadea their traps and moved out to
again Invade Turkey. It was not yet clear daylight, but they felt thst
they might well start early since they were no longer mounted men.
On tlie way to the bridge the dragoman, although he was curiously In
love with his 40 Cranes a day and h!9 opportunities, ventured a stout pro
test based apparently upon the fact that after all this foreigner, four cays
out from Athens, was somewhat at his mercy. "Meester Coleman." he
Eaid. stopping suddenly, "I think we make no good If we go there. Much
better we wait Arta for cur horse. Much better. I think this no good.
There ls coming one big fight and I thick much better we go stay Arta.
Much better."
"Oh. come off." said Coleman. And In clear language he began to
labor with the man. "Look here, now, if you think you are engaged In
steering a bunch of wooden-headed guys about the Acropolis, my dear
partner of my joys and sorrows, you are extremely mistaken. As a mat
ter of fact you are paid now to be the dragoman ot a war correspondent
and you were engaged and are paid to be one. It becomes necessary that
you "make good. Make good, do you understand? I'm not out hi -o to be
bunkoed by this sort of game." He continued indefinitely in th:3 strain
and a* intervals he asked sharply, "Do you understand?"
perl the dragoman was dumfounded that the laconic Coleman
could on occasion talk so much, or perhaps he understood everything and
was impressed by the argumentative power. At any rate he suddenly
wilted. He made a gesture which was a protestation of martyrdom, and
picking up his burden proceeded on his way.
When they reached the bridtre they stlw columns of Greek Infantry.
dead black in the dim light, crossing the stream and slowly deploying on
the other shore. It was a bracing sight to the dragoman, who then went
Into one of his absurd babbling moods, in which he would have talked the
head off any man who was not born in a country laved by the childish
Mediterranean. Coleman could not understand what he lid to the soldiers
as th--*v passed; but it was evidently all grandiose nonsense.
Two light batteries had precariously crossed the rickety bridge during
the night, and now this force of several thousand Infantry, with the two
batteries was moving out over the territory which the cavalry had recon
noltered 'on the previous day. The ground being familiar to Coleman he
no longer knew a tremor, and regarding his dragoman he saw that that
Invaluable servitor was also in bettor form. They marched until they
found one of the light batteries unllmbered and aligned on the lake of
grass about a mile from t^bere parts of the white bouse appeared above
the tree tops. Here the dragoman talked with the captain of artillery, a
tiny man on an Immense horse, who for some unknown reason told him
that Â«h!s force was going to raid Into Turkey and try to swing around the
opposing army's right flank. He announced, as he showed his teeth ln a
smile, that it would be very, very dangerous work. The dragoman pre
cipitated himself upon Coleman. "â â l'-.-'l;
"This is much danger. The eopten he tell me the traps- go now. in
back of the Turks. It will be much danger. I think much better we go
Arta wait for horse. Much better." Coleman, although he believed he
despised the dragoman, could not help but be Influenced by his fears. They
were so to speak, in a room with one window, and only the dragoman
looked forth from the window, so If he said that what he saw outside
frightened him Coleman was perforce frightened also in a measure. But
when the correspondent raised his eyes he saw the captain of the battery
looking at him. his teeth still showing in a smile, as if his Information,
whether true or false, had been given to convince the foreigner that the
Greek 3 were a very superior and brave people, notably one little officer of
artillery He had apparently assumed that Coleman would balk from ven
turing "with such a force upon an excursion to trifle with the rear of a
hard-fighting Ottoman army. He exceedingly disliked that man, bitting
un'there on his tall horse and grinr.ing-like a cruel little ape with a secret.
In truth Coleman was taken aback at "the outlook, but he could no more
refrain from Instantly accenting this half-concealed challenge than he
could have refrained from resenting an ordinary form of Insult. His mini
was not at peace, but the small vanities are very large. He was perfectly
aware that he was being misled Into the thing by an odd pride, but any
how it easily might turn out to be a stroke upon the doors of Nlkopolls.
He nodded 'and smiled at the officer ln grateful acknowledgment of his

The Infantry was moving steadily afield. Black blocks of men were
tri'line In column slowly over the plain. They were not unlike the tacks
of dominoes on a green baize table: they were so vivid, so startling. The
corresDondent and his servant followed them. Eventually they overtook
two companies In command of a captain who seemed immensely glad to
have the strangers with him. As they marched the captain spoke through
the draeoman upon the virtues of his men, announcing with other news
-he fact that his first sergeant was the bravest man in the world.
"a number of columns were moving across the plain parallel to their
line lot march and the whole force seemed to have orders to halt when
they reached a long ditch about four hundred yards from where th_ shore
of the rTlaln arose to the luxuriant groves with the cupola of the big white
bn-Se sticking above them. The soldiers lay along the ditch, and the
bravest man In the world spread his blanket on the ground for the cap*
tata Coleman and himself. During a long pause Coleman tried to eluci
date the Question of why the Greek soldiers wore heavy overcoats even in
the bitter beat of midday, but he could only learn that the dews, when
they came ' were very destructive to the lungs. Further, he convinced
b'mself anew that talking through an Interpreter to the minds of otHer
m'en was as satisfactory as looking at a landscape through a stained-glass
"â â  "After a time there was ln front a stir near where a curious hedge of
dry brambles deemed to outline some sort of a garden patch. Many of the
soldiers exclaimed and raised their guns. But there seemed to come a
general understanding to the line that it was wrong to fire. Then Dres
ertlv Into the open came a dirty brown figure, and Coleman could see
through his glasses that its head was crowned wjth a dirty fez which had
once been white. This indicated that the figure was that of one of the;
Christian peasants of Eplrue. Obedient to the captain the sergeant aiosel
a-id waved invitation. The peasant wavered, changed his mind, was ob
viously terror--* trick en. regained confidence and then began to advance
r''**r uitously toward the Greek lines. When he arrived within hailing dis
tance the captain, the sergeant, Coleman's dragoman and many of the
solders yelled human messages, and a moment later he was seen to-be*
a poor, yellow-faced stripling, with a body which seemed to have been
rÂ«t twisted by an ill birth and afterward maimed by either labor or op
pression, these being often identical in their effects. .AX- Xt
v t-t's reception of the Greek soldiery was no less fervid than their wel
come of him to their protection. He threw his grimy fez In the air and
crocked out cheers, while tears wet his cheeks. When he had come upon
tbe right side of the ditch he ran capering among them and the captain,
the sergeant; the dragoman and a number of soldiers received wild em
braces and kisses. He made a dash at Coleman, but Coleman was now
wa" in the game and retired dexterously behind different groups. with a
finished appearance of not noting that the young man wished to greet hm.
Behind the hedge of dry brambles there were more Indications of life.
and the peasant stood up and made beseeching gestures. Soon a whole
flock of miserable people had come out to the Greeks, men, women and
children In crude and comic smocks, prancing here and there -iproar
fously embracing and kissing their deliverers. An old tearful toothless
hag flung herself rapturously into the arms of the captain, and Coleman s
brlck-and-!ron soul was moved to admiration at the way in which the
officer administered a chaste salute upon the furrowed cheek. The &*__Â£_
man told the correspondent that the Turks had run away from the village
up in a valley toward Janina. Everybody was proud and happy. _
A malor of Infantry came from the rear at this time and asked the cap
tain in sharp tones who were the two strangers in civilian att ira Jlhea

The major strode st ths bead of hie men with the group of villagers
singing ana dancing about Mm and looking upon mm aa if he were - god.
Coleman and the dragoman, at the tfflcer** request, marched on* on either
side of him, and ln this manner they entered the village.' Prom all sorts
of hedges end thicket* people cams creeping out to pass into a delirium
of Joy. The major borrowed three little pack horee* with rope bridle* and
thus mounted snd foUowed by the clanking column they rode on in
triumph. 1.-.v: ..-:â â â  y '-*
It wee probably mors of a trae festival thsn moet men experience evon
In the longeet Ufeitims. The major with hi* Greek instinct of drama was
s aplendld personification of poetic quality*, in fact he was himself almost
a lyric. Prom time to time he glanced back at Coleman with eyes half
dimmed with appreciation. The people gathered flowers, great blossom*
of purple and corn color. They sprinkled them over th* three horsemen
and flung them deliriously under the feet of the Uttle nags. Being now
mounted, Coleman had no difficulty in avoiding the embrace* of the peas
ants, but he felt to the tips of his toes an abandonment to a kind of pleas
ure with which he was not at all familiar. Riding thu* amid cries of
thanksgiving addressed at him equally with the others, he felt a burning
virtue and quite lost his old self ln an Illusion of noble benignity. And
there continued the fragrant hall of blossoms.' .:;
Miserable Uttle huts straggled along the sides of the village street as
if they were following at the heel* of the great whit* bouse of the bey. The
column proceeded northward announcing laughingly to the glad villagers
that they would never see another Turk. Before them on the road wa*
here and there a fez from the head of a fled Turkish soldier ana they lay
like drops of blood from some wounded leviathan. Ultimately It grow
cloudy. It even rained slightly. In the misty downfall the column of
soldiers ln blue was dim a* lf It were merely a long trail of low-hung
smoke.
They came to the rv.ns of a church and there the major halted his
battalion. Coleman worried at hts dragoman to learn If the halt was only
temporary. It was a long time before there was answer from the major,
for he had drawn up hi*, men in platoons and was addressing them in a
speech as Interminable as any that Coleman had heard In Greece. The
officer waved his arms and roared out evidently the glories of patriotism
and soldierly honor, the glories of their ancient people, and he may have
Included any subject in this wonderful speech, for the reason that he had
plenty of time in which to do It. It Was impossible to tell whether the
oration was a gcod or a bad one, because the men stood In their loose
platoons without discernible feelings as if to them this appeared merely
as one of the inevitable consequences of a campaign, an established rule
of warfare. Coleman ate black bread and chocolate tablets while the,
dragoman hovered near the major with the Intention of pouncing upon
him for information as soon as his lungs yielded to the strain upon them.
The dragoman at last returned with a very long verbal treatise from the
major, who apparently had not been as exhausted after his speech to the
men as one would think. The major had said that he had been ordered
to halt here to form a junction with some of the troops coming direct from
Arta and that he expected that in the morning the army would be divided
and one wing would chase the retreating Turks on toward Jannina, while
the other wing would advance upon Prevasa, because the enemy had a
garrison there which had not retreated an Inch, and although it was
cut off it was necessary to send either a force to hold it ln its place or a
larger force to go through with the business of capturing It. Else there
would be left in the rear of the left flank of a Greek advance upon Jan
nina a body of the enemy which might become active. Tlie major said
that his battalion would probably form part of the force to advance upon
Prevasa. Nlkopolls was on the road to Prevasa and only three miles away
from It. . -'.-.-,â 
CHAPTER Xn.
Coleman spent a long afternoon ta the drizzle. Enveloped in his mack
intosh he sat on a boulder ln the lea of one of the old walls and moodily
smoked cigars and Ustened to the ceaseless clatter of tongues. A ray of
light penetrated the mind of the dragoman and he labored assiduously
with wet fuel until he had accomplished a tin mug of coffee. Bits of cinder
floated in it, but Coleman rejoiced and was kind to the dragoman.
The night was of cruel monotony. Afflicted by the wind and the dark
ness the correspondent sat with nerves keyed high waiting to hear tne
pickets open f.re on a night attack. He was so unaccountably sure that
there would be a tumult and panic of this kind at some time of the night
that he prevented himself from getting a reasonable amount of rest. Ho
could hear the soldiers breathing ln sleep all about him. He wished to
arouse them from this slumber which, to his Ignorance, seemed stupid.
The quality of mysterious menace in the great gloom and the silence would
have caused him to pray if prayer would have transported him magi
cally to New York and made him a young man with no coat playing bil
liards at his club. _'---"â -'.-- â â '*'- â ':*-*:X:: *r*X:v:.
The chill dawn came at last and with a flne elation which ever follows
a dismal night In war; an elation which bounds in the bosom as soon
as day has knocked the shackles from a trembling mind. Although Cole

The dragoman announced thst the major had suddenly lent Y*Â«*fL_srV_
to some other people, and after ourelng thia versatility of Â«nÂ«*rest lis
aummoned his henchmen snd they moved out on foot. foUowing th* sound

and the dragomen pointing at them said: "They going Prevaaa. That la
roed to NlkopoUs.'r Coleman grinned from ear to ear and "lapped bis
dragoman on the shoulder. For a moment he Intended to hand tb* men
a louia of reward, but he changed hia mind. _ _-'* '* ___ Â__,
Their trapa were in the way of being heavy, but they minded J little
einoe the dragoman was now a victim 'of the Influence of Coleman* en
thusisam The road wound along the base of the mountain range, sheer
ing around the abutments in wide white curves end then cironng into gie.ia
where immense treea apread their ahade over it Some of the great trunks
were oppressed with vines green ac garlands, and these vinea even ran
like verdant foam over the rocks. Streams of translucent water show
ered down from the hilla and made pool* In which every pebble, every
leaf of a water plant shone with magio luster, and if the bottom OX s
pool wsa only of clay th* clsy glowed with sapphire Ught. The flay waa
fair. The country tru part of that land which turned the minds of it*
ancient poets toward a more tender drearylng so that indeed their nympns
would die, one la Burs, in the cold mythology of the north with its storms
smid the gloom of pine forests. It was all wine to Coleman a spirit. It
enlivened him to think of succeas with absolutely surety. To be sure one
of hie boots began soon to raep hia toes, but he gave It no snare of his
attention. They passed st a much faster pace thsn the troopa and every
where they met laughter and confidence and the cry, "On to Prevaas.
At midday they were st the heels of the advance battalion, among
ita stragglers, tsklng Ita white dust into their throata and eyes. The
dragoman was waning and he made a number of attempts to stay Cole
man, but no one could have had influence upon Coleman a steady rush
with hia eyes alwaya straight to the front as lf thus to symbolise hia
ateadlneas ofpurpoae. Rivulets of sweat marked the dust on hia face, and
two of hia toe* were now paining sa if they were being burned oft. He
wsa obliged to concede a privilege of limping, but he would not atop.
At nightfall they halted with, the outpost battalion of the infantry.
All the cavalry had ln the meantime come up and they saw their old
frienda. There was s village from which the Christian peasant* came
and cheered like a trained chorua. Soldiers were driving a great flock
of fst sheep Into a corral. They hsd belonged to a Turkish bey and thay
bleated aa if they knew that they were, the mere spoil* of war. Coleman
lsy on the ateps of the beys house smoking, with hia head on his blanket
roll. Campflres glowed off In the field*. He ws* now about four miles from
Nikopolia. X*
Within the houae the oommander of the cavalry wss writing dispatches.
Officers clanked up and down the stairs. The dashlngyoung captain cams
and said that there would be a general aaaault upon Proves* st the dawn
of the next day. Afterward the dragoman descended upon the village
and ln some way wrenched a Uttle gray horse from sn inhabitant Its
packsaddle was on Its back snd lt would very handily carry the trapa.
In thia matter the dragoman did not consider hia msster; he considered
bia own sore back.
Coleman ate more bread snd ehooolste tablets and also some tinned
sardines. He was content with the day's work. He did not ace how he
could have Improved it There waa only one route by which the Wain
wright party could avoid him and that wss by going to Prevesa and
thence taking ship. But since Prevaas wss blockaded by a Greek fleet
he conceived that event to be Imnoeelble. Hence he had them hedged
on this peninsula and they must be either st Nlkopolls or Prevasa. He
would probably know all early ln the morning. He reflected that he waa
too tired to care If there might be a night attack and then wrapped in hia
blankets he went peacefully to Bleep ln the grass under a big tree with
the crooning of some soldiers around their flre blending into his slumber.
And now, although the dragoman had performed a number of festa
of incapacity, he achieved during the on* hour of Coleman'a Bleeping
a blunder which for real finish was aimply a perfection of art When
Coleman, much later, extracted the full story it appeared that ringing
events happened during thst single hour of Bleep. Ten minutes altar
he had lain down for a night of oblivion the battalion of infantry, which
had advanced a little beyond the village, waa recalled and began a hur
ried night march back on the way It had bo festively coma It was sig
nificant enough to appeal to almost any mind, but the dragoman was
sble to not understand It. He remained Jabbering to some acquaintances
among the troopers. Coleman had been asleep his hour when the dashing
young captain perceived the dragoman and. completely horrified by hie
preaence at that place, ran to him snd whispered to him swiftly thst
the game was to flee, flee, flee. The winr of the army which had advanced
northward upon Jannlna had already been tumbled back by the Turks
snd all the other wing had been recalled to th* Louros River and there
was now nothing practically between him and his Bleeping master and
the enemy but a cavalry picket. The csvalry wae immediately goinir to
make a forced march to the rear. The Btricken dragoman could even thon
see troopers getting Into their saddles. He rushed to the tree, and In a
panic simply bundled Coleman upon his feet before he was awake. He
stuttered out his tale and the dazed correspondent heard it, punctuated
by the steady trample of the retiring cavalry. The dragoman saw a
man's face then turn In a flash from an expression of luxurious drowsiness
to an expression of utter malignancy. However, he was too much In a
hurry to be afraid of lt; he ran off to the little gray horse and fren
zledly but skillfully began to bind the traps upon the packsaddle. He ap
peared in a moment tugging at the halter. He could only say: "Come!
Come! Come! Queek! Queek!" ' They slid hurriedly down a bank to
the road and started to do again that which they had accomplished with
considerable expenditure of physical power during the day. The hoof
beats of the cavalry had already died away and the mountains shadowed
them in lonely silence. They were the rear guard after the rear guard.
The dragon. a:: muttered hastily his last dire rumors. Five hundred
Circassian cavalry were coming. The mountains were now infested with
the dread Albanian Irregulars. Coleman had thought In his daylight
tramp that he had appreciated the noble distances, but he found that
he knew nothing of their nobility until he tried this night stumbling.
And the hoofs of the little horse made on the hard road more noise
than could be made by men beating with hammers upon brazen cylinder-.
The correspondent glanced continuoally up at the crags. From the other
side he could sometimes hear the metallic clink of water deep down in
a glen. For the first time in his life he seriously opened the flap of his
holster and let his fingers remain on the handle of his revolver. From
Just In front of him he could hear the chattering of the dragoman's teeth
which no attempt at more coolness could seem to prevent. In the mean
time the casual manner of the little gray horse struck Coleman with
maddening vividness. If the blank darkness was simply filled with fero
cious Albanians the horse did not care a button: he leisurely put his
feet down with a resounding ring Coleman whispered hastily to the drago
man. "If they rush us. Jump down the bank, no matter how deep It ls.
That's our only chance. And try to keep together."
All they saw of the universe was in front of them, a place faintly
luminous near their feet, but fading in six yards to the darkness of a
dungeon. This represented the bright white road of the daytime. it had
no end. Coleman had thought that he could tell from the very feel of tho
air some of the landmarks of his daytime Journey, but he had now no
sense of location at all. He would not have denied that he was squirm
ing on his belly like a worm through black mud.
They went on and on. Visions of his past were sweeping through
Coleman's mind precisely as they are said to sweep through the mind
of a drowning person. But he had no regret for any bad deeds; he re
gretted merely distant hours of peace and protection. He was no longer
a hero going to rescue his love. He was a slave making a gasping attempt
to escape from the most Incredible tyranny of circumstances. He half
vowed to himself that If the God whom he had ln no wise heeded would
permit him to crawl out of this slavery he would never again venture
a yard toward a danger any greater than may be incurred from the police
of a most proper metropolis. If his juvenile and uplifting' thoughts of
other days had reproached him he would simply have repeated and re
peated, "Adventure be damned."
It became known to them that the horse had to be fed. The debased
creature was asserting its right to do as it had been trainedâ to follow
its gust-omy lt was asserting this tfgbt duripg a situation, whioh required
conduct superior to an training aad owtom. It was ps grossly ootnpsa
tional thst Coleman would bars understood that dacaeolao form of anger
which sometimes leads men to lab knives lato warm bodies. Cowman
from cowardice tried to induce the dragoman tp go ahead leading the
horse and the dragoman from cowardloe tried to induo* Coleman to
go ahead leading tbe horse. Coleman, qf course, bsd to succumb. The
dragoman wss only good to walk behind and tearfully whisper melodlo
tions as be prodded the flanks of their tranquil beast _
at the aftsoluts blaok of the frequent forests Coleman not see his
feet sad he often felt like a man walking forward to fall st sny moment
down a thousand yards ef chasm. He heard whispers; he saw skulking
figures, snd these frights turned out to be the voice of a Uttle trickle
of wat*_\or the effects of wind among ths leaves, but thsy were replaced
by the same torrents tn slightly different forma
Then the poignant thing Interpolated. A volley crashed ahead of them
Some half a mile away snd another volley answered from a still nearer
point Swlahing noises which th* correspondent had heard in the air he
now knew to have been from the passing of bullets. He and the dragoman
cam* stock still. They heard three other volleys sounding with the abrupt
clamor of a hall of Uttle stones upon a hollow surface. Coleman and the
dragoman came close together and looked Into the whites of eaoh other's
eyea The ghastly horae at that moment stretched down hi* neck and
began placidly to pluck the grass at the roadside. The two men were
equally blank with fear and each seemed to seek In the other some newly
rampant manhood upon which he could lean at this time. Behind them
were the Turks. In front of them was a fight in the darkness. In front
it was mathematio to suppose in fact were also the Turks. They were
barred; enclosed: cut off. The end was come.
Even at that moment they heard from behind them the sound of
slow, stealthy footsteps. They both wheeled instantly, choking with this
additional terror. Coleman saw the dragoman move swiftly to the Eide
Of the road, ready to Jump Into whatever abyss happened to be there.
Coleman atlll gripped the halter aa if it were in truth a atraw. Tha
stealthy footsteps were much nearer. Then it was that an insanity camo
upon him as if fear hsd flamed up within him until it gave him all the
magnlflecent desperation of a madman. He Jerked the gray horse broadside
to the approaching mystery, and grabbing out his revolver aimed it from
the top of hia improvised bulwark. He hailed the darkness.
"Haiti Who's there?" He had expected his voice to sound Uke a
groan, but Instead It happened to sound clear, stern, oommar.dlnr, like
the voice of a young sentry at an encampment of volunteers. He did
not seem to have any privilege of aelectlon aa to the words. They were
born of themselvea , . ''.._,
He waited then, blanched snd hopeless, for death to wing out of the
darkness and strike him down. He beard a voice The voice said: Do
you speak English?" For one or two seconds he could not even under
stand English, snd then the great fact swelled up and within him. This
voice with, all its new Quaver* was still undoubtedly the voice of Pro
fessor Harrison B. Wsinwright of Washurst CoUega
CHAPTER XIII.
A change flashed over Coleman aa if lt had come from an electrhj
storage. He had known the professor long, but he hsd never before
heard a Quaver ln hi* voles, and it was this little Quaver that seemed
to Impel him to supreme disregard of the dangers which he looked upon
as being the final dangers. His own voice had quavered.
When he spoke he spoke ta s low tone: it was the votes of the master
of the situation. He could hear his dupes fluttering there in, the darkness.
"Tes," he said, "I speak English. There is some danger. Stay where you
axe and make no noise," He was as cool ss sn Iced drink. To be sure
the circumstances had In no wise changed as to his personal danger, but
beyond the Important fact that there were now othera to endure it with
him he seemed abl* to forget It in s Btrange, unauthorised sense of vio
tory. It came from the professor's quavers. _-__.Â«_-_
Meanwhile he had forgotten the dragoman, but he recalled Mm to time
to bid him wait. Then, sa well concealed as s monk hiding In bis cowl,
he tiptoed back Into a group of people who knew him intimately -He dis
cerned two women mounted on Uttle horses and about them were dim
men. He could hear them breathing hard. "It Is all right" he began
smoothly. "Tou only need to be careful"â _._Â«_ Â»_
Suddenly out of the blackness projected a half phosphorescent face. It
was the face of the Uttle professor. He stsmmered, "Weâ weâ do yott
really speak English?** Coleman in his feeling of superb triumph oould
almost have laughed. His nerves were as steady a* hemp, but he was

ptantly the correspondent felt about him that kind of a tumult which
tries to suppress Itself. He knew that lt was the most theatric moment
of hia life. He glanced quickly toward the two figures on horseback.
He believed that one was making foolish gesticulations while the other
sat rigid and silent. This latter one he knew to be Marjory. He was con
tent that she did not move. Only a women whowas glad he hedoame
but dia not care for him would have moved. This appUed directly te
what he thought he knew of Marjory's nature ..

in such a situation might a centurion. "S-s-steadyP He seized the aÂ»__
of the professor and drew him forcibly close. "The condition is this," he
whispered rapidly. "We are ln a fix with this fight on up the road. I
was sent after you, but I can't get you into the Greek lines to-night.
Mrs. Wainwright and Marjory must dismount and I and my man will take
the horses on and hide them. All the rest of you must go up about a
hundred feet into the woods and hide. When I come back I'll hail you and
you answer tow." The professor was like pulp in his grasp. He choked
out the word "Coleman" in agony and wonder, but he obeyed with
a palpable gratitude. Coleman sprang to the side of the shadowy figure
of Marjory. "Come." he said authoritatively. She laid in his palm a Uttle
icy cold hand and dropped from her horse. He had an Impulse to cling
to the small figure, but he loosened them Immediately, imparting to his
manner as well as the darkness permitted him a kind of casual politeness
as If he were too intent upon the business ln hand. He bunched the
crowd and pushed them Into the wood. Then he and the dragoman took
the horses a hundred yards onward and tethered them. No one would
care if they were stolen; the great point was ta get them where their
noise would have no power of revealing the whole party. There had been
no further firing. *'*;'..
- he had tied the little gray horse to a tree he unroped his lug
gage and carried the most of it back to the point where the others had
left the road. He called out cautiously and received a sibilant answer. He
end the dragoman hunted among the trees until they came to where a
forlorn company was seated awaiting them, lifting their faces like frogs
out of a pond. His first question did not give them any assurance. Ho
said at once. "Are any of you armed?" Unanimously they lowly breathed
"No." He searched them out one by one and finally sank down by the
professor. He kept a sort of hypnotic handcuff upon the dragoman, be
cause he foresaw that this man was really going to be the key to the
best means of escape. To a large neutral party wandering between hostile
lines there was 'technically no danger, but actually there was a great
deal. Both armies had too many irregulars, lawless hillsmen come out
to - fight '. their ' own way, and if they were encountered In the dead of
night on such hazardous ground the Greek hillsmen with their white cross
on a blue field would be precisely as dangerous as the blood-hungry
Albanians. Coleman knew tnat the rational way was to reach the Greek
lines and he had no Intention of reaching the Greek lines without a
tongue, and the only tongue was in the mouth of the dragoman. He was
correct in thinking that the professor's deep knowledge of the ancient
language would give him small clue to the speech of the modern Greek.
As he settled himself by the professor the band of students, eight In
number, pushed their faces close. _^
He did not see any reason for speaking. There were thirty seconds of
deep silence In which he felt that all were bending to hearken to his
words of council. The professor huskily broke the stillness. "Well â¢ â¢ â¢

jfirst Allan in California to Wear a Drees Suit
A pfaneep who orated a sensation on
the Sheets of sacrannento fn

WUST forty-nine years ago Sacra-
I â maelstrom of all human
\ emotions as it was, and had been

S*^ discovery had acted as a load

ditions to this common center â experi
enced a new and surprising sensation.
Nothing tbat bad up to that time
ever occurred ln that then feverishly
busy and prosperous metropolis of Cal
ifornia bad given such a decided shak
ing up to the entire community and
created such unanimous and openly
expressed Interest sa an event which
took place during one sunny afternoon
of a perfect day In June of the year
ISSO.
Robberies, murders and suicides there
had been even then on this side of the
Rockies ghastly tragedies of moral
and physical death such as always fol
low ln the wake of intense mining ex
citement where greed of gain for a
time overshadows all else, save in the
strongest and noblest natures. These
heppenlnga, however, lacked tbe ele
ment of novelty which distinguished
tbe act performed on this special and
long-remembered occasion by a pre
viously retiring and unassuming young
man, who thereby made himself the
center of undivided public attention for
tbe time betas and tbe hero of the
hear.
Tbere fai still more than one hardy
pioneer left bere in California who re
mem hers weH the occurrence, which
erven at tbe time was far more than
a "-lna days' wonder.** The one who
remembers It best of sH. however, ls
naturally be wbo played tbe somewhat
exacting rote of the star in the high
class comedy performance that took
tbe town of Sacramento by storm dur
ing: hia brief engagement and made
most decidedly tbe ""hit of tbe season."
This mail is Aimo-ln B. Paul, for
many years past and now a resident of
San Francisco amd a more than locally
noted mining engineer and authority
oq aQ mining matters.
For a brief thirty minutes or so, Mr.
Paul was the cause of an entire sus
pension of business on the principal
atreets of Sacramento, in those days
wben every moment of a business hour
was a golden one.
And what, pray, was the sot which
be accomplished that had the power to
work snch an upheaval ln the estab
lished customs of the money-making
town? "Wbat doughty deed did he per
form, or what spectacle did he present,
that attracted to himself the unwaver
ing observation of the multitude and
made him the focus of the pubUc gaze?
"Wbat was it which was the occasion of
his springing so suddenly from com
parative obscurity since the town was
generally too busfiy preoccupied to take
much notice of individuals â Into the
fierce light of notoriety? "What was lt
that gained him that day a title which

son City in JB6J.
S~y TABBED with bowie - knives,
Voy shot, and clubbed almost to
V J death, all at the same time, and
r**^ yet living to tell the tale! It
seems almost Incredible, and yet
William Gardner of Sacramento bears
on his head and body the indisputable
evidence of his thrilling experience, and
the array -of long-healed wounds is to
him a badge of honor, for he received
them while defending the "Stars and
Stripes."
William St. Clare Gardner came to
California with Commodore Sloat as a
"powder monkey" on the United States
Snip Congress. During the bombard
ment of Vera Cruz he received wounds
for which he was afterward honorably
discharged from the navy.
Like many other pioneers William
Gardner, or "Bill," as he is familiarly
called, has made and lost two or three
fortunes. In the capital city's golden
days he was associated with Frank
Rhoadea In the draying business, and it
was a poor day's work that brought in
only $75.
His Ufe has been full of adventure
and hairbreadth escapes.

has dung to him through all the al
most half-century of years that have
passed since, and is as well known to
his brother pioneers as is the name that
is his own by birthright and baptismal
ceremony?
He simply arrayed himself in such
garments as a man of fashion in those
days would have worn for a promenade
on a Parisian boulevard, or possibly,
on the shady side of "the avenue" in
the American metropolis, and took a
leisurely walk along the principal
streets of his temporary home. The
result was â business and social â
for the entire period of his ramble.
His costume was the epitome of ele
gance from the top of his shining tall
beaver hat to the tips of his patent
leather boots and the ends of his gloved
fingers. He was simply a living expo
nent of correct masculine garments, as
they were depicted in the French fash
ion plates which California, in those
days, never saw; but had he been
dressed in pink tights and the fluffy
skirts of a feminine ballet-dancer he
could not have created a more genuine
sensation.
To make fully understood the effect
which Mr. Paul's raiment produced
upon his townspeople lt may be neces
sary, perhaps, to state that Sacramento
at that time was emphatically a "shirt
and trousers town." In a population
of 15,000 or more there were less than
flfty white women, and the men, feel
ing themselves free from all conven
tional restraints ln the matter of ex
ternal adornment, dressed in the sim
plest and what seemed to them the
most comfortable fashion. Blue or red
flannel or checked gingham or seer
sucker shirts buttoned at the throat or
not aocording to the weather or the
fancy of the owner, and with their
nether extremities tucked into the
waistband either of trousers made of
the roughest and most serviceable
cloth, or of stout and baggy overalls;
a pair of heavy boots with tops reach
ing to the wearer's knees; and almost
any kind of a hat that came handy â
so it had a brim wide enough to pro
tect the eyes from whirling dustclouds
and the glare of the completed a
costume that was perfectly satisfactory
to every white man in California , at
that time.
Not only miners and teamsters and
those engaged in rough work generally
arrayed themselves in this unpreten
tious and inexpensive manner, but even
the merchants and clerks and other
men who depended for their livelihood
more on the exercising of their brains
than their muscles.
So universal was this custom of
rough-garbing that it early became an
unwritten law in all the towns and
mining camps and it was a long time
even after the first gold excitement
quieted down before a "biled shirt" was
looked upon as being anything but a
proof of effeminacy and general fool
ishness on the part of its mistaken
wearer.
Almarin B. Paul was, however, a

told ln his own words:
"Yes, I've had some pretty close car
but that little scrap In Carson City was
one of those affairs that a man doesn't
care to run up against more'n once ln
his life.
"You see, it was this way. I was run
ning a saloon over in Carson City, Nev.,
in '61. It was a regular red-hot rebel
town, 'cause, you see, about nine
tenths of the inhabitants were South
erners.
"One day, about the Ist of August,
the messenger rode into town, his horse
covered with foam and before he was
fairly on the ground, the news of the
battle of Bull Run had spread through
that camp like a prairie flre.
"Right In the middle of town the boys
had put up a pretty good-sized flag
staff and the next day after the news
came of the battle of Bull Run I heard
that some of the ladles had met and
were making a rebel flag, which was
going to be run up ln place of the
'stars and stripes.'
"I told 'em at the time, says I, if you
try to take down that American flag
you'll have to do it over my dead body.
"I was only one of a handful of Van-
stout-hearted and adventurous young
fellow ln these days, and, besides, be
dearly loved a Joke. He was well
known and well liked ln Sacramento,
as he and his partner, under the firm
name of Paul, White & Co., had dealt
in general merchandise and miners'
hardware since the previous November,
and it struck his youthful fancy that
he would like to do something a little
out of the common.
He had been a prosperous young
business man in St. Louis before com
ing to California, and when he packed
his belongings for his long trip the
whim had seized him to include among
them a full suit of clothes of as ultra
fashionable a cut as a St. Louis tailor
could provide, and with these every
accessory that could possibly be con
sidered necessary to the toilet of a
regular Beau Brummel.
"I didn't expect to wear them much,
of course," he says, lf he can be coaxed
to tell the story himself, smiling at the
recollection of carrying this collection
of masculine finery in his train and
paying extra baggage on lt all the way
from Missouri across the isthmus and
through the Golden Gate and up to
Sacramento. "I just wanted to feel that
I could dress up fine if I wanted to,
but," and he laughs again, "I never
wanted to dress up but Just one time in
the first few years I was in California,
and then I didn't stay dressed up for
more than half an hour."
Elegant as were these garments
which Mr. Paul brought with him from
"the States," fate threw another and
far more gorgeous piece of raiment in
his way before he reached his destina
tion, which â¢ overshadowed all his pre
vious possessions in that special line.
The steamer Oregon, for passage on
which he and his companions held tick
ets, having become temporarily dis
abled by running upon some rocks on
her return trip to Panama, 125 of the
Impatient travelers banded together
and chartered the bark Eugene to make
the trip to San Francisco. Among this
number were several men of pro
nounced sporting proclivities, especially
ln the lino of cards, and the long pas
sage of 104 days, due to many vexatious
calms, gave these adventurers an ex
cellent opportunity to prey upon their
companions.
One young man, a son of an ex
tremely wealthy New Tork family, was
particularly unfortunate in this con
nection and long before the bark
reached its destination was rendered
utterly penniless by the superior skill
of his supposedly friendly antagonists,
who played with him, of course, "Just
to pass away the time."
In his extremity the unsuccessful
young gamester had resort to his
trunk by which to supply him
self with funds sufficient to tide
him over his troubles until such
time as he could, secure a re
mittance from home. He had been trav
eling in Europe when the gold fever
attacked him and among his valuable
proofs of that fact was a coat for which
kees in Carson City, but I made up my
mind I'd prevent that rebel flag from
going up or die a-trying.
"Well, about noon of the sth of Aug
ust, '61â that's when it happenedâ
of August, '61, word was brought to me
that that white flag with the palmetto
tree embroider* on it was to be un
furled to the breeze that very day.'
"When I heard that I" just locked up
the store and, says I, not if William
St. Clare Gardner lives long enough,
there won't be no rebel flag run up to
day. ix'Xy.. ---r.
"Pretty near as quick as I can tell it
I was at the foot of the flagstaff.
"The crowd was already there ahead
of me, and I had only just time to see
that the red, white and blue was still
floating above our heads, and then I
made a grab for that rebel flag.
"Yes l got it all right, and quick as
a flash I wound it about my hand.
"After that I was kept pretty busy
for a few minutes. I didn't have no gun
nor nothing, but, if I do say It myself,
ln those days there wasn't many men
could stand up before me in a single
hand-to-hand fight.
"The flght was a little uneven that
day, however. Fists don't count for
much against bowie-knives and nistols,
and three of the worst desperadoes in
the country had undertaken to do me
up. -XXXI -â : r * â 
"They slashed and cut at me until the
flag, which was still around my arm
and with which I protected my face to
some extent, was dripping with blood.
The flag was burled afterward.
"Finally one of them drew a pistol,
and placing it right here, over my
heart, fired. I guess providence must
have had his eye on me that day, for
the bullet went to one side.
"Poor John Blackburn - was United
States Marshal :at that time, and he
was the only man in the whole crowd
that stood by me or tried to help me.
His wife, by the' way, was one of the

trying to put an end to the unequal
struggle, when the long keen blade of a
bowie-knife was buried in. his â¢ heart.

"As it turned out, I was right, you '
see. Bill Mayfield was killed, not long \
after, in PlacerviUe. Idaho, by a gam- â¢

he had paid In Paris Just previous to
leaving that gay city the sum of 400
.rancs. Ascertaining the fact that Mr.
Paul and himself were of precisely the
same size he so importuned him to buy
the garment that the young merchant
against his wiser Judgment and moved
far more by the moneyless predicament
of his fellow voyager than by any real
desire for the coat's possession finally
consented to purchase it, and packed It
away with his other sartorial treasures
where it remained for eight long
months before he ever dreamed of ex
hibiting it in public. The description
of this coat, as given by Mr. Paul, fills
the modern mind with an emotion very
nearly approaching to awe. It was, he
states, of the very finest and best black
French tweed, lined with heavy black
satin, with the collar, lapels and cuffs
hand embroidered â think of that, ye

elaborate, exquisitely designed and ar

bud and bloom worked ln lustrous black

This was the crowning glory of the
attire in which Mr. Paul took his fa
mous promenade up one side of J street
and down the other on that long-cele
brated summer afternoon. And the
men who possibly and indeed probably
would have jeered at the bashful and
apologetic appearance in their midst of
even one small deviation from the es
tablished order of things in the straight
and narrow way of masculine attire
stood -imply spellbound before the ag
gregation of dazzling splendors of which
young Paul was the motive power.
"I did It just as a piece of fun," he
says, "but I didn't feel a bit funny after
I got the things on and started out.
Some of the other young fellows had
kind of half-way dared me to do it, you
see, and I thought it would be kind of
a joke. It was no joke at all, though, I
found, for a circus wouldn't be more
stared at than .I - was. Luckily , there
were no Httle boys around then or I
should have been the head of a regular
procession.
"As it was I never felt so much alone
in my life as I did walking those few
blocks, but I wouldn't hurry the least
little bit. I walked slowly enough for
everybody to get a good look at me
that wanted, but when I got back into
my store I packed those things all
away again and went back into my
gingham shirt and rough trousers
about as quick as I could conveniently
manage it. I would have given those
dandified clothes of mine away to al
most any one who had asked for them
about that time, and it was many a
long month after that before I ever
wore any of them again."
The fame of that afternoon promen
ade, however, spread widely abroad,
and from then until now Mr. Paul has
been known as the individual who had
the courage to be "the first really well
dressed man in California." ' .Count Jfirokichi Mutsu pisaisses tfe\9 Jreaty ie)ith Japan

Such was the statement of Count

the conditions then prevailing. Jap

a number will accompany the expedition,
which will be carried by the steamer
Fish Hawkâ a vessel specially fitted for
the sort of work contemplated, and pro

"The fact that a Westerner had to be
tried in the court of his Consul, where
the ignorant would naturally charge
favoritism, forced the Japanese author
ities to be exceedingly careful in ac
quiring ample evidence against any
foreigner who should commit a crime.
Accordingly, the Westerners were lim

treaty ports, and to particular quar
ters of these so-called concessions. If
they moved elsewhere they were oblig

"This last feature is most Important
for San Franciscans. Japan's trade is
unexplolted by the United States.
There are only 1140 Americans in Ja
pan among the entire 40,000,000 of the
Japanese. Of these about 600 are
women â members of- the families of
the male residents. Now subtract from
these the American Consuls and their
staffs, together with the other Ameri
cans who reside in the country as of

the merchant element numbering only
a few hundred. These, of course, have
been confined to the five treaty ports.

have taken up their residence in Japan,
have accomplished marvels for the
commerce of their country with us.
It cannot be said that all the bulk of
goods- moving from the United States
to Japan were set in motion th*- ugh
their influence, but they have und-- '*-t
edly placed the greater part. The ag
gregate of these imports into Japan
from the United States during 1898 was
about 40,000,000 yen; in 1892, just four
years prior, it was less than 6,000,000
yenâ a yen being about 50 cents in
your coinage. Yor can see, therefore,
that we buy from you now nearly sev

en times as much as we did only four
years ago.
"The imports into the United States
from Japan, while greater in value
than your exports to us, do not show
the same relative increase. In 1892
these were about 38,500,000 yen; in 1898
they were about 47,250,000 yen, showing
an increase in purchases from us for
the four years of about 10,000,000 yen,
while the increase in purchases from
you had been about 34,000,000 yen.
"In this bulk of business the part
which San Francisco has played Is
conspicuous. In 1894 San Francisco
6ent to all countries values to the
amount of $22,643,127; of this $1,278,780
went to Japan. For the same year the
imports into San Francisco from all
countries were $38,515,686, while from
Japan they were $13,400,518. In 1898 the
San Francisco exports were $32,679,218,
of which $4,516,245 went to Japan,
showing an increase ln the four years
of about $2,250,000. The imports from
Japan, on the other hand, had fallen
Oft nearly $5,000,000, for out of the total
imports through the Golden Gate of
$36,063,124. but |8,185,072 came from
Japan. It should be said, however,
that owing to the drought the Japan
ese trade of last year with this port
was $4,500,000 less than the year be
fore.
"You can see from this, therefore,
that notwithstanding you are taking
less from us, we are buying more from
you than heretofore. And yet there are
some of your people who cry out in
alarm at this newly developed capac
ity of Japan to buy from you; they de
mand higher tariffs against our goods,
and declare that American goods are
in danger of being undersold in their
own markets by products of Japanese
manufacture. Such people would. It
seems, prefer to have old Japan than
new Japan as their neighbor; they
would prefer the conditions when we
sold you practically nothing and
bought practically nothing than things
as they now are and are growing to be.
If this reasoning were correct, if you
have most to fear from the countries
of the greatest productive capacity,
one would naturally expect that that
part of your continent which lies near

ductive powers would be shriveled up
under the fierce glare of their light.
But this Is not the case. The richest
and most industrial part of the United
States lies closest to the great indus
trial centers of Europe; and it is ob
served that as the countries of Europe

ductive and consumptive power, that

The Fish Commission steamer Fish
Hawk will first have to find the tropical
belt, which is no easy matter owing to
its narrowness, and then to follow it
along. This will be accomplished with
the help of a special apparatus consist
ing of a sounding line of wire with a
heavy sinker on the end. to which is at
tached a thermometer. Tne sounding line
is run off a huge reel, and the thermome
ter is fixed in such a way as to turn

when it touches about 52 degrees Fa
renheit, with a depth of 500 to 700 feet

may be taken for granted that the strip
has been struck.
An important part of the expedition's
work will be to map out the limits of
the present range bf the tile fishâ the
dweller of the strip that caused such a
sensation a few years ago. It was in 1878
that the fishing schooner Hutchings, try
ing with trawls for hake in new waters,
100 miles south of Nantucket, took thou
sands of pounds of a flsh up to that time

from five to flfty pounds, and a trial of

such goods, notwithstanding England
had been increasing enormously dur-
ing the decade as a manufacturer. Few
countries have increased in manufac-

Germany. In IS7B you sent her $16,500,
- worth of goods, and notwithstand-
ing her enormous growth In ability to
manufacture and ship abroad, in 1808
your exports to her were $32,700,000.
The same story could be told of France
and of Belgium. In fact all that a na
tion has to buy with is its goods, and
the more of these it can produce the
greater is its buying capacity.
"Another feature of the new treaty,"
continued the Count, "is that trade-
marks, designs and patents are pro-
tected in Japan. Heretofore any Jap-
anese could imitate any of your trade-
marks; they cannot do so now. This
will clean out a considerable business
that has been thriving at the expense
of standard names, but it will be a "-ood
thing for legitimate ventures.
"Japan's trade with the Philippines
is not now an uninteresting thing to
you in California. This, too, has quad-
rupled itself since 1892. In that year
the imports from the Philippines were
475,122 yen and in IS9S they were 3.294,
- yen; the exports to the Philippines
were in 1892 95,193 yen, while in 1898
they had increased to 107,871 yen, so
you can see that even from that part of
your dominions Japan buys many times
more of value than she sells. I have
not a doubt that under the Increased
activity in trade which must come of
the extended opportunities made possi
ble by the new treaty, that we shall
take vastly more from the Philippines
than heretofore, and our imports from
San Francisco will increase even at a
more rapid ratio than ln the past."
Remarking upon the Japanese In
California, Count Mutsu stated that
there are about 5000 of them, chiefly
young men who have come to this State
to get an education, working out their
board in families while they are so do-
ing. The laborers are energetic and in-
dustrious, but they do not save their
money as do the Chinese. They spend
it as fast as they get it, buying knick-
knacks, trinkets, books and such.
They have aided the development of
California Industries to a great extent,
but they have not appeared at any
time as a menace to the labor condi
tions of the State, nor are they likely
to do so. The development of the in-
dustries of Japan, which are now going
on at such a rapid rate, will soon make
a demand for labor in that country ac-
companied by a scale of remuneration
so high that any wages which can be
offered them in the United States will
hardly induce them to emigrate to this
country. JOHN E. BENNETT.

The Fish Commission experts declared
the flsh a new species and an investigation
was proposed; but before it could be car
ried out a dreadful catastrophe occurred.
In March and April, ".882, vessels arriving
at Boston, New York and Philadelphia
reported that they had passed through
hundreds of miles of dead and dying fishes
of an unfamiliar kind floating on the sur
face of the sea. These, as it proved, were
tile fish, and the evidence gathered on
the subject showed that at least 7500
square miles of ocean were strewn thickly
with scaly victims numbering at least one
thousand millions enough to feed the en
tire population of the United States for
two months.
Thus passed the tile fish, tho whole
species being apparently wiped out by a
mysterious and wholesale calamity. But
subsequent . investigation has made lt
pretty clear that the catastrophe was
caused by an intrusion of frigid water
upon the tropical strip. Running south

ready explained. Is an Arctic current from
Labrador, which during this fateful sea
son carried much more cold water than
ordinarily, possibly because of the pres
ence of unusual quantities of floating ice
in the North Atlantic. The cold stream
pushed away the warm stream from the
continental slope and froze the tile fishes
to death.
It was feared that the tile fish had been
rendered extinct, but ten years later, in
1592, the Fish Commission- steamer Gram
pus caught eight specimens in the belt,
and there was great rejoicing. Since then
the species has multiplied fast along the
strip, and Dr. Bumpus is confldent that
large numbers will be taken by his expe
dition. The tile Is a rapid breeder and
has few enemies to fear, being large and
fierce. It bites greedily at any kind of
bait, and there ls every prospect that be

29THE OLDEST SISTERS IN THE WORLD.
SE-MUL-LAH, NINQ-LIO AND TEMESCAL, THE CENTENARIAN INDIAN WOMEN OF SAN DIEQO COUNTY.
THERE can be no doubt that th.
three oldest sisters in the United
Statesâ possibly in the whole world
are some Indian women in San Diego
County, in Southern California
Many a circus and dime museum
man has been after them in the past few
years and has offered large sums for the
old women to leave their families and as
sociates and go out for exhibition pur
poses. But one might as well try to coax
a bear with diamonds and champagne as
to try to Induce these aged Indians with
offers of gold and a living in the best
hotels. Those out here, who know the
Indians' ways, always smile when an
agent for a circus or a dime museum
comes to make offers to these three old
savages.
The women are Se-mul-lah (meaning
peaceful^. Ning-lio (meaning black-eyed)
and Temescal (meaning sharp at a bar
gain). Their combined ages are 296 years.
Se-mul-lah Is the eldest; she was 103 years
old last June. Ning-lio is l"" and Temes
cal is the juvenile of the trio. She was
95 some time last summer. They are rem
nants of the 1... 1 i:. tribe, who were a
part of the thousands of friendly savages
known in California as the Mission In
dians, from the fact that they voluntarily
went under the fostering care of the
Franciscan missionaries in the latter part
of the eighteenth century and gave their
children to the missionaries for Instruc
tion. These old women are able to speak
a few words in English, but their talk is
a Jargon of Spanish and Indian. Each of
them has several score of descendants. A
few years ago a friendly priest in San
Diego took the trouble to hunt up among
the half-breed Indians as many descend
ants as possible of Madame Ning-Uo. He
found that they were scattered among
the reservations in Sonora, Mex., in Low
er California and in four counties in
Southern California, and that they num
bered over seventy. There were about
forty great-grandchildren alone, and some
of them were big boys and girls, and never
knew that Ning-Uo was any relative of
theirs.
There ls not the least doubt among the
people ln Southern California who have
given any attention to these uncommonly
old sisters as to their ages. That ls a
matter of record in the musty old regis
ters ln the archives of the mission at San
Gabriel, in Los Angeles County; also in
a church census taken ln 1810 and now In
the mission of Guadalupe, at the City of
Mexico, where nearly all the records of the
California missions were taken upon a
disestablishment of the Roman Catholic
missions in 1532. There is a record of the
baptism of Ramon Aguilan, a Saboba In
dian, under the charge of the mission at
Ran Diego. The record shows that Ramon
was the father of fourteen children. The
first was born In May, 1759. Se-mul-lah
was born in 1794, and Ning-lio was the
seventh child, and born in 1799, while little
Temescal came in 1801. There Is no record
of deaths in the Indian family, but the
daughters used to say, and it is a mat
ter of tradition among the Indians in San
Diego County, that Ramon died when he
was over a century old. One of his sons
died ln 1887 at the age of 92 years, as the
result of a fall from a cliff. The three sis
ters have never been forty miles away
from home, and have never been out of
what ls now San Diego County, and until

all countries. From time to time rumors
have reached San Francisco telling of the
triumphs achieved by Miss Francisco,
now in Paris, now at Monte Carlo and
last, but not least, comes this engage
ment at Dresden.
Just seven years ago Miss Francisco
was a school girl with a very pretty
voice. She studied at the Fabbri-Muller
Conservatory, and both Madame and
Monsieur Muller were very enthusiastic
about the treasure they were sure they
had discovered. "She combines," said
Monsieur Muller, "warmth and execu
tion, a rarity, believe me. It seldom is
that an artist sings with expression and
that quality of voice direct from the
heart so necessary to the complete con
ception of a role. If Miss Francisco has
developed as she promised to do, and as,
according to the great European critics,
she has done, San Francisco will one day
bo proud of her as one of the greatest
prima donnas in the world."
After leaving San Francisco Miss Ml
chelson adopted the name of her native
city and became professionally known as
Fannie Francisco. From here she went
to Paris and studied four years under
Mme. Marchese. The great teacher was
enthusiastic about her American pupil,

THE ORIGIN OF
LAUGHTER.
Why we laugh Is a question that has al
ways puzzled those who are accustomed
to think -deeply. The laugh, which is now
so closely associated with good humor and
kindly feeling, originally expressed the
exact reverse. It was the crow of tri
umph over a fallen foe. Such ls Its na
ture still among savages, and Its unex
pected manifestations are occasionally
very startling. Dancing on the body of a
prostrate enemy is, In fact, to them hilar
ious fun.
Any new device for torment is a clever
jest. The inflicting of a ghastly wound as
some poor wretch runs the gauntlet makes
them yell with glee. The things that
shock or horrify or disgust the civilized
man are about the only things worth
laughing at from a savage's point of
view. With the exception, therefore, of
rough practical Jokes, which may possibly
wrinkle his stolid features with a mo
mentary grin, the barbarian has no appre
ciation of civilized humor. Even the
knowledge that he himself is to be the
next victim does not spoil the fun of a
cruel spectacle for a barbarian thorough
bred.
Some Siamese who had been engaged in
a revolt were captured redhanded and
sentenced to military execution. A com
pany of soldiers had been drawn up with
loaded muskets, before whom the doomed
men were led out in squads ot five or six
to be shot, while those who were waiting
their turn stood by, under guard, looking
on. When the first volley was fired the
victims, torn by the storm of bullets,
leaped into the air with violent contor
tions and fell dead. And this to the poor
wretches whose turn lt was next to go
through the same experience seemed so
fine a show and so excruciatingly funny
that they were fairly convulsed with
laughter.
Such is the humor of the uncivilized, and
such doubtless were the beginnings of
mirth the world over. Strange as It may
seem, there are many hints of this bar
barous origin in the fun of the most

A CURIOUS SEA
SERPENT.
Many persons have professed to have
seen sea serpents, and while the general
belief Ib that there are no such creatures
it ls quite likely that those who claim to
have Been them did see things which they
honestly and very naturally believed to be
sea serpents. A striking example of the
manner ln which persons may be de
ceived in this matter has just been given
by Dr. R. Dv Bois-Raymond in a paper,
in which he describes his experiences on
board of the Serapis in October, 1890.
It was rather a foggy morning, and the
water was as smooth as glass. The vessel
was going through the Magellan Straits,
and the hours passed monotonously until
suddenly the passengers noticed an ex
traordinary object in the water some dis
tance away.
At once the cry arose that It could be
nothing but a sea serpent, and, indeed,
there seemed to be excellent grounds for
this statement, since the object was cer
tainly alive, and as it moved through the
water presented all the appearance of an
immense snake. That it had a huge head
was clear to every one, and that it was
possessed of an enormous body was mani
fest from the manner in which it splashed
the water on all sides.
A powerful telescope was procured and
the uncanny object was studied through
it. Then its true character was at once
revealed. Instead of being a sea serpent
it was simply a herd of sea lions. The
animals were clustered close together,
and as they gamboled and moved through
the water they certainly presented the
appearance of a long and bulky snake. If
they had been at a greater distance it
would have been difficult to discover what
they really were, and It Is not impossible
that the passengers would forever after
have remained convinced that they had
actually seen the wonderful sea serpent.

Temescal has been married three times
and has had. first and last, more than a
dozen children. Her last husband died
a year ago at the age of about 80. She
has several children who are between the
ages of 70 and SO years. She has a great
great-granddaughter over 25 years old,
and has several great-great-great-grand
children, but the relationship is so remote
when it gets to that stage that the pro
genitors of a race among Indians lose
all interest in their increasing progeny.
One of the old lady's great-great-grand
sons is a bright, active man in the sponge
and oyster business In Guaymas, Mexico.
His mother and his grandfather were
full-blooded Mexicans, and he has very
little of the Indian character in him.
Se-mul-lah, the eldest of the aged trio
of sisters, is said by the white ranchers
who live near the Saboba reservation to
have been the smartest of the trio until
about seven years ago, when she had an
attack of the grip that nearly ended her
days and dulled her mind. She used to
have a fairly good memory of events, but
no idea, as few Indians do. of ages and
the lapse of time. She remembered the
building of the second San Diego mission
by the priests and the Indians. That was
in 1806. She had a vivid recollection of
an earthquake in 1807 that ruined several
of the Franciscan missions in California.
She has never forgotten the name of her
husband, and all the names of her many
children but two or three of her eldest
sons. She is a proud old dame, and to
this day she knows what are the gaudiest
garments, and she vigorously insists on.

She seldom speaks and then only in a few
words of Spanish. She used to be proud
of her extreme age. but now pays no at

her span of life the more unusual. She
walks sometimes a half mile or so about
the Indian village, and will pose at any
time so that a kodak fiend may get her

power ard the indescribable
charm of manner that have for nearly
a generation made her famous amon?
the great actresses of the world. In
fact, Mme. Modjeska is in better physi
cal condition and her Intellect is even
keener. if that were possible, than
when she began her last season's tour
under the management of John C.
Fisher.
Mme. Modjeska met every engage
ment on that long tour, which began
at San Diego ci iy in September and
ended in Denver on April 29, after ex-
tending throughout New England and
the Middle States. Business was good
everywhere, an.' not only Modjeska;
but Msnas-er Fisher, made consider.- ble
money. The co ... scson besrins at
Fan Dirgo, as beforo, where rehearsals
by the company ' -ye been in progress
since August 7 in Mr. Fisher's opera
house.
Thomas G. Moses of New Tork and
Thomas O. Moses of New Tork and
a staff of well-known artists have been
- at work for weeks past painting new
" ncenery for the tour. This includes
Â«- borate productions for the play of
"Marie Antoinette," which is to he the
moot pretentious in Modjeska's reper
toire. Other strong plays* are "Mac-
beth,'' "Marie Stunrt," "Much Ado
About Nothing." "Gringoire" and the
"Ladles' BattÃ." the last two being a
Joint production.
John E. Kellerd. a celebrated actor,
new- to the Pacific Coast, but whose
fame is great in New York and Lon-
don, wil! be Modjeska's leading man.

this country. Miss Kate Dalglish, a
beautiful young lady and a finished
actress, is perhaps most prominent
among the ladles supporting Modjeska.
Miss Mary Hall of Kansas City, one of
the most beautiful young ladles on the
Btage, and Miss Mary Gardiner of Bos-
ton are also with Modjeska. The en-
tire company numbers twenty-six per-
sons.
Little Bessie Bhskirk of Los Angeles

she will also appear as Mary Stuart, a
part well suited to her temperament
and In which she is decidedly popular.
Commenting the other day upon her
plays, Modjeska remarked that they
were all grand, and that she had no
favorite among them. "I never had a
favorite part in all my experience on
the stage," said the famous actress in
her quaint and beautiful accent. "If
I felt that I was successful in any
character that was enough, and I
would as readily take up another part
as to continue in the old one. Every
character I have assumed has been of
Intense interest to me, and I look
ahead to playing the part of Marie
Antoinette with as much interest as I
ever felt over any character.
"Marie Antoinette will be my prin
cipal role the coming season, ln some
respects, at least," continued Mme.
Mrrdjeska. "The play is all based upon
historical factsâ all the names are his
torical, and lt ls a true story, therefore
strong. There is nothing so fine as
that which is from NatHre. The lan
guage, too, is all beautiful. The 'Marie
Antoinette' we will play has nothing to
do with the old version of Glaconettl,
but is quite different. Our version,
written by Clinton Stuart, will be given
for the first time this season, and will
be gorgeous.
"I have long wanted to take the part
of Marie Antoinette, but never liked the
old version, in which the language is
far from attractive. I have wondered
how I could make so much out of it. It
is more of a melodrama than the new
style. Mr. Kellerd will take the part of
King Louis XVI. The 'Ladies' Battle,'
in which Mr. Kellerd is prominent, but
in which I do not appear, is a costume
play, translated by Clinton Stuart.
"Shakespeare?" repeated Modjeska.
In answer to a question as to her opin
ion of the Bard of Stratford-on-Avon.
"Shakespeare is immortal, and there
fore will never grow old. I am devoted
to Shakespeare, but he has so few char
acters of importance for women. There
!s Katherine, in 'Henry VIII,' and
Lady Macbeth, and Beatrice in 'Much
Ado About Nothing,' and then there is
but one leftâ Queen Constance in 'King
John,' but the play is so somber that
no manager dares produce it. I asked
Edwin Booth, when I was with him,
why he never played 'King John," and
he said it was too gloomy, as well as
too expensive,"-
