LOSSES ARE HEAVY

Mortally Wounded.
LONDON, Oct. 22. â The War Office this afternoon published the following dispatch to the
Secretary of State for War, the Marquis of Lansdowne, from the general commanding in
Xatal. Sir George Stewart White, regarding the engagement yesterday at Elands Laagte,
between Glencoe and Ladysmith, when the British under General French routed the Transvaal
forces under General Jan H. M. Koek. second in command in the Transvaal, who was himself
wounded and captured and has since died:
"White, commander in Xatal, to the Secretary of State for Warâ Filed Ladysmith. Octo
oer 22. 10:30 a. m.: In the action at Elands Laagte yesterday the troops engaged were
the following: Cavalry â Fifth Lancers, a squadron of the Fifth I >ragoon Guards, the Imperial
Light Horse and two squadrons of Xatal Carbineers: artillery â Twenty-first Field Batten-, For
ty-second Field Battery and the Xatal Field Batten-; infantry â the Devonshire Regiment, half a
battalion of the Gordon Highlanders and the Manchester Regiment. The whole force was un
der General French, with Colonel lan Hamilton commanding the Infantry.
"I was present in person from 3:30 to 6p. in., but did not assume direction of the fight,
which was left in the hands of General French. Although desultory fighting took place earlier
in the day. while reinforcements, sent out later on ascertaining the enemy's strength, were arriv
ing from Ladysmith. the real action did not begin until 3:30 p. m. At that hour the Boers held a
tion of very exceptional strength, consisting of a rock hill about a mile and a half southeast
of Elands Laagte station.
"At 3:30 p. m. our guns took position on a ridge 4100 yards from the Boers, whose guns at
once opened fire. This fire was generallly well directed, but somewhat high. This time, contrary
to previous experience, their shells burst well.
'"The Imperial Light Horse moved toward the left of the enemy's position and two squad
rons of the Fifth Lancers toward his right. During the artillery duel mounted Boers pushed out
from their left and engaged the Imperial Light Horse. In a few minutes theenemv's gunsceased
firing and our artillery was turned on the mounted Boers who opposed the Imperial Light
The latter at once fell back.
''After the artillery preparations our infantry advanced to the attack, supported by our
guns in the second position. The Devonshires held the enemy in front, while the Manchester
Regiment and the Gordon Highlanders turned his left flank.
"The Boer guns, although often temporarily silenced, invariably opened fire again on the
slightest opportunity and were served with great courage. After severe fighting our infantry car
ition. At 6:30 p. m. this was accomplished, the enemy standing his ground to the
ast with courage and tenacity. The Fifth Lancers and a squadron of the Fifth Dragoon Guards
charged three times through the retreating Boers in the dark, doing considerable execution.
"We captured the Boer camp, with tents, wagons, horses and also two guns. The Boer
3 were very considerable, including a number of wounded, and unwounded prisoners. Among
â rmer was General Jan Kock and Piet Joubert. nephew of Commander General Joubert.
"One goods train, with supplies for Glencoe Camp, and nine English prisoners, were re
covered. Our loss, I regret to say, was heavy. It is roughly computed at 150 killed and
wounded.
"The collection of the wounded over a large area in the dark and the arrangements for
sending them in have thus far occupied our time and attention. A full list will go to you later.
"â ( hir wounded and those of the enemy are now arriving by trains. Besides Boers, we
have many Hollanders, Germans and prisoners of mixed nationalities. The behavior of our
troops and of the colonial forces was admirable."
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 22. â The following additional details from official sources are~at
hand regarding the battle yesterday at Elands Laagte:
"The Boers, although driven from their guns, returned again and again whenever an op
portunity occurred. The high ground near the left of the enemy's position was occupied at the
commencement of the action, the British creeping along the crest and making a wide circuit.
"â¢The infantry attack was directed against the right of the enemy's position, the British
coming quickly into contact with the Boers, who at that point occupied a strong footing, which

UNBEATEN AND DEFIANT
THE BOERS MEET DEATH
Bravery of Burghers at Talana Hill Ex
cites the Admiration of Their
English Foes.
LONDON, Oct. 22.â A correspondent
In Glencoe Camp, telegraphing on
October 20 and describing the fight-
Ing that followed the first engage
ment In the Boer attack upon the
British position that day, says:
"It was after the battle was renewed,
following the lull that ensued upon the
sharp cannonading of the British which
silenced the guns of the Boers on Smiths
Hill, that our casualties began. The In
dian hospital corps of COOlies under Major
Donegan of the Eighteenth Hussars ran
out, keeping in the rear of the advancing
infantry and artillery that had galloped
from the second position through the
town amid the cheers of the citizens.
"At this point the Boers became erratic.
Our artillery was firing on the hill where
the Boers were stationed in great num
bers, but the return fire did little dam
age. The enemy kept up an incessant
shoottng, but our shrapnel began to tell
its tale, with the result that the Boer
fire visibly slackened. From a ceaseless
rattle the rifle fire dwindled to straggling
shots.
"A corporal of the Dublin Fusil eers was
carried past me to the roar on a stretcher.
Major Davidson of the Irish Fusileers
was shot through both legs and Color
Sergeant Anderson of the Dublin Fusl
lfÂ» rs was brought in wounded in the
right shoulder.
"The artillery in front was shelling the
hill and the Kings Royal Rifles on the
right front were busy with the Maxims,
making the Boers anxious a*bout their
position. Their artillery had been silenced
by the spiendid service of ours.
"Meanwhile a squardon of the Eigh
teenth Hussars and a mounted company
of the Dublin Fusileers were creeping
around on the enemy's left flank, while
another sauadron of the Hussars and a
mounted company of the Kings Royal
Rilles deployed to the right flank at the
cornfields.
"The artillery continued to play on
Smiths Hill with a range of nearly 3000
yards. I'r.rier its cover the Dublin Fusi
leers and the Kings Royal Rifles pressed
forward. It was in the execution of this
maneuver that the casualties to our in
fantry occurred several men being killed
or wounded.
The firing now eased off on our side and
only a solitary shot was returned now and
then. General Synions, taking advantage
of this lull, rode rorward with his staff
in front of the guns, taking cover at the
rear of the plantation, mar the base of
the hill. All this time our Infantry, in
extended formation, had gradually press
ed forward, watching the Boers from the
rear of thu artillery and massing on the
extreme left of the hill.
"I saw three shells in quick succession
cut some to pieces and drive others away.
The Boer fire was becoming hot. but the
first battalion of the Kings Royal Rifles
! and the Irish Fusileers. led ri Bpectlvely
I by Colonel Cunning and Colonel Carlton,
; continued to mount the hill. Gradually
they extended along the ridgo, and at tfl
o'clock, after four and a half hours' of
artillery liritig to screen them, they man
aged to reach a wall, running- parallel
I with the ridge, about 600 yards from the
i summit.
"This position was gained under cover
of some magnificent shooting by our artil
i lerymen, who placed shots at the point
! where the Boers were massed with amaz
: ing accuracy, compelling them to retire.
j But not for long. On again the deter
mined burghers would come, only to be
beaten back asain by the excellent shoot
ing of the Thirteenth and Sixty-ninth
batteries under Major Dawkins and
Major King.
"At 11:45 a. m. the firing had almost
erased and our Infantry were over the
wall In a twinkling and rushing toward
the. plateau at the base of the top or sec
ondary ridge. The defense by the Boers
was most determined, the enemy again
and again pouring a long fusillade fire
into the British ranks, which was hotly

ASSAULT ON GLENCOE
Heavy Firing in Progress Near the Scene
of the Recent Battle of
Talana Hill.
GLENCOE CAMP, Natal, Oct. 22.â Heavy firing
is now in progress to the northwest of this
camp.
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 22â A dispatch) has just
I arrived announcing that tr;e Boers are spelling
j Dundee, east of Giencoe, at long range, but tfoat
jthjeir fire is ineffective. The Boers are led by
jCon)n)andant-General Joubert. It is believed trje
railroad between Ladysmith and Giencoe has
been repaired.
It is now definitely known that Giencoe was
dttacKed yesterday by tbe Boer rr)ain northern
column. Our forces are intrenched in a good
position. The situation tr;ere is not yet frully
cleared up.

returned In well directed volleys by the
stoutly advancing Dublin Fusfleers and
Kings Royal Rifles.
"A large body of Boers, driven from
Smiths Hill, took refuge in a cattle kraal,
intending a crossiire. The Thirteenth
Battery opened tire, however, and poured
in such a hail of bullets as caused them
speedily to shift their position.
"Thus far the enemy had displayed un
doubted courage, perhaps unequaled by
the best European troops. Tiny had
stood up to our scattering artillery fire
with the greatest determination, and
then, on Talana ridge, standing clearly
out on the sky. they still appeared un
beaten and defiant.
"The battle had now raged six and one
half hours, when the Sixty-ninth was or
dered to limber up and advance. The
battery galloped into a new position in
splendid form and was in action at the
front in a moment.
"So effective was the apparent result
of this close range firing that the Thir
teenth Battery was at once ordered up.
and after two rounds from each battery
perfect silence reigned over the enemy's
front, broken only by the whirring of
the Maxims served by the Dublin Fus
ileers, who had secured an excellent posi
tion to the right. During a momentary
cessation the Boers had taken up a posi
tion on a hill to the right of the road
leading to Maima Colliery, but the Thir
teenth Battery soon opened fire on them
and compelled them to retire.
"Meanwhile the two infantry battalions

continued to climb up the hill, and at 1:39
p. m., after eight hours of desperate
lighting, the position was carried, ths
Boers having; precipitately evacuated the
hill. Thus what had commenced with a
battle at Dundee ended in a glorious vic
tory for British arms at what must be
known as the battle of Talana Hill.
"Just as the Kings Royal Rifles and
the Dublin Fusiloers gained the hilltop,
the mounted infantry could be seen work
ing around the left flank of the Boer
position and actually getting in their rear
without any attempt on the part of the
enemy to check the movement .while the
bulk of the mounted volunteers, well
hidden in the riantation on the right,
were ready to fal! upon the retreating?
enemy In that direction when the moment
came.
Finally our batteries ceased their
murderous fire and the Infantry charged
up the rocky heights still separating them
from the enemy, and reached the summits
of both peaks of Smith's Hill and of the
Neck between without a check or halt.
It was gallant work on both sides and
scores of men fell within a distance of a
couple hundred yards; but the situa
tion soon became too hot for the Boers,
who broke and fled for their horses,
which they had left at the foot of the
hills on the northeast. There, however,
they were received with a fusillade from
the Hussars, who had stampeded or
captured all the horses.
The enemy swerved in their line of re
treat. Some surrendered there and then;2

BECHUANALAND NOT
INVADED BY BOERS
LONDON, Oct. 22.â The latest dis
patches received to-day do not lndlciate
any Incursion of Boers as yet into Beehu-
I analand. Along the Orange River every.
j thing seems to be quiet. From Colesburg,
Colony, It is reported that all the
available burghers of the Orange Free
â¢ have been sent north and west.
On the other hand, a messenger from
AJiwaJ north reports that a large body
ocrs Is advancing toward the Orange
I River. Refugees are leaving that
in great numbers daily. The Boers have
mounted a Krupp gmi on a bridge com
manding the most thickly populated part.
Advices from Cape Town say that a
whohlesnme fear of a rising in Basuto
: land prevents the Boers invading Cape
y, and that on the other hand there
I is considerable excitement at Masuru and
other Busuto stations, arising from na
tive apprehensions of Boer attacks.
H appears that colonial news is m some
mysterious way supplied to the Boers,
and that their movements depend largely
upon intelligence communicated through
natives. Disquieting news coitus from
Herschell and other points In Cape Col
ony, where the natives are much ex
cited.
ENGLISHMEN ASSUME
SANGUINE ATTITUDE
LONDON,. Oct. 22.â There Is no longer, I
however, any apprehension of even the j
expected Initial success of the Boers. The j
two victories already gained by the I
British must have completely disillusion- j
laed them of the idea they had gained
through the Majuba affair, and, looking;
to the statements already circulated that â 
President Kruger himself was opposed to j
sending the ultimatum, there is specula
tion In some quarters that the Boers may I
now sue for peace. At least it is con
sidered that all fear? of a Dutch rising
In the British colonies may be set aside.
Much admiration has been excited by the
bravery shown by the Boers.
The Times says: "They are honorable I
foes and well worthy of uur mettle. Their !
sterling qualities ought to do much to ;
facilitate the ultimate pacification of
South Africa. It is now the real end of
the war. We have settled once for all
the Question of supremacy and to banish
er the phantom of an Afrikander ]
nation."
The Dally Xews, on the contrary, says:
"It Is not at all likely that the two victor- I
lea portend a speedy end of the war. The
Boers will fight on, and our army of oc- i
cupation must be hurried forward. The (
appalling loss of officers and men we have :
sustained shows clearly that we have
stiff work before us. The army corps will ;
have ample work to do.
"The second British victory, that at
Elands Laagte. in which the British |
losses, though heavy, were not out of pro
m to its importance, may be re
garded as having completely demoralized
ell laid but ineffectively executed
plans of the Boers. ]n the opinion of mil
itary critics it will tend to bring the war
to a speedy conclusion.
"General White, it is hoped, may have!
able by this time to relieve Major I
Yule at Glencoe, thus enabling him to deal i
with General Jnubert's column as General
Symons and General French have already i
d*ne with the others.
"There is still to be guarded against a
le raid from the Drakenburg range
!'>â  Free State troops or from vryheid
through Zululand. The British plan' will
fore, to a great extent, be still on
the defensive, as Sir George White has .-in
extended front, threatened at many
points, to protect."
FIFTY=THREE BOERS
SLAIN AT MAFEKING
CAPE TOWN, Oct. 22.â A message received from Colonel Baden-Powell,
in command of Ma f eking, dated October 15, says that flfty-three boers wore
killed and a larpe number wounded in the encounter with hiÃ force.
It is believed that the explosion of dynamite at Mafeking, so cleverly ar
ranged by Colonel Baden-Powell, resulted In a very large loss to the Boers,
so that it Is quite probable that General Cronje will not resume the attack
and will perhaps retire altogether.
LONDqpf. Oct. 22.â The Daily Telegraph publishes the following dis
patch from its special correspondent:
KIMBERLEY (via Hope town), Oct. 23.â The Kimberley Advertiser pub
lishes full details of the fighting at Mafeking on Saturday last, supplied
by its correspondent who rode 200 miles to telegraph it and who narrowly
escaped capture by the Boers. In the course of the story he says the fight
ing was extremely hot. Captain Fitzclarence made an attack on the Boers
while they were retreating from the armored train. The Boers, In spite of
borne slight cover afforded by stunted trees, suffered severely. Later the
Boers were reinforced and reopened fire.
Captain Fitzclarence was now In difficulties and the troop of Lord
Charles Cavendish-Be-ntinok's squadron under Lieutenant Brady, with a
seven-pounder gun, escorted by Troop C of the squadron under Captain
Sar.dford, came up In reserve. The gunners got a hot reception, but with
out loss shifted their position and began shelling the Boers In the bush.
Fitzclarence meantime handled his men grandly. Their volley fire was moat
effective, the Boers gradually drawing off.
The greatest gallantry was displayed by Surgeon Anderson, who dressed
the wounds of the Injured under a hall of bullets. With the greatest dif
ficulty he prevented the wounded rejoining the firing line. Want of cav
alry prevented Colonel Baden-Powell following the retreating Boers.

DEFEATED
Continued from First Paze.
they held resolutely until a flank attack
was made by our troops, who advanced
with great dash, and in spite of heavy
losses carried the main position with a
rush, just as the light was falling.
"The ground traversed by our troops
was rough and stony, and the capture of
the position was a fine feat of arms. The
cavalry lapped well around and Inflicted
severe losses on the enemy.
"It was highly Important to strike a
severe blow, as the Orange Free State
forces are known to be concentrated
northwest of Ladysmlth in considerable
strength. The flank attack was gallantly
delivered by the Manchester Regiment,
the Gordon Highlanders and the Impe
rial Light Horse. The front attack was
done with splendid spirit by the Devon
shire Regiment.
"The wounded are being attended In the
principal church at Ladysmlth, which has
been converted into a hospital."
ROUT OF THE BURGHERS
BECAME A SLAUGHTER
LADTSMITH, Oct. 22.â Realizing that
the first attack on Glencoe'was part of
a general combined attack by three col
umns, and that the situation was still se
rious so long as the Boers held the rail
road at Elands Laagte, severing commun
ication between Ladysmith and Dundee,
Sir George Stewart White on Friday re
solved to give battle with a view of re
capturing Elands Laagte.
On the morning of that date all the
mounted troops here, supported by two
battalions of infantry and two batteries
of artillery, reconnoitered some twelve
miles along the Newcastle road, an open,
rolling country, very suitable for ca% - alry
operations, although the going was heavy
after the recent rains.
On approaching within three miles or
so of the break In tho railway line our
men saw the Boer outposts falling back,
apparently In no great force. We cap
tured four, who had mistaken our men
for Boers until we were too near for thorn
to get away. Then our men returned and,
later Friday night, General White deter
mined to advance in force on Elands
Laagte at an early hour the following
morning. It was imperative that we dis
lodge the Boers from Elands Laagte, as
we had learned that the Orange Free
State burghers were descending from
their positions on the slopes of the Dra
kenburg, from Tintwa and other western
B, to co-operate with those already
posted at Elands Laagte.
At an early hour our forces moved out
by road and rail. It was computed that
there were about 12' X) Boers, with big guns
and Maxims covering their front and oc
cupying a well chosen position at the
base of a hill, some little distance south
â  i Elands I^aagte. On both flanks were
strong kopjes, on which were three big
guns strongly posted and commanding a
wide sweep on all sides, leaving an open
ing for retreat.
A British armored train, supported by
two trainloads of Infantry, immediately
upon approaching the enemy's position,
was shelled by the Boers, Our artilh ry
was at once brought up and drove the
Boers from their guns, making a series
of brilliant dashes Into the valley and up
the successive heights to get nearer the
Boers' main position. Thrice were the
Boer batteries on the way silenced by our
artillery, although the Boers fought with
great pluck and determination, returning
each time our guns moved and raining
shrapnel and Maxim bullets against our
advance.
At 4 o'clock a treniendous artillery duel
was in progress. Two Boer guns, splen
didly placid, were stubbornly fought for
two hours and a quarter, while mounted
i:. era endeavored to come Into contact
with our men on the left and on the right.
Then at 0:15 the Devonshire regiment,
half the Gordon Highlanders, half the
Manchester regiment and the Imperial
Light Horse advanced on the position
and stormed the enemy's front. A bay
onet charge was sounded as the roar of
artillery oh both sides suddenly ceased,
anu our men, the Devonshire leading,
made a superb dash against the inn m
body of the Boers, undaunted by facing
a fearful fire. Twice were they checked
by the terrible fusillade. Once the ad
vance quivered for a moment, but then,
with ringing, roaring cheers, the whole
of our ftirce hurled Itself forward like
an avalanche and swept over the KOPJes,
bayoneting the brkoen enemy in all di
rections. , , . .
The Boers were overwhelmed and as
tounded. They paused, then retreated,
then raised the white flag and surren.l.-r
--ed Two or three hundred broke and ran,
pursued by the Fifth Lancers, who
charged through and through them.
It was quite dark by this time, but the
slaughter must have been greut. The
Gordon Highlanders say the storming of
DarKui Ridge was more child's play com
pared with this attack. The Boer losa
must have been very heavy. The best es
timates place it at certainly over 4")
killed One of the captured Boers told me
that If he had known English Boldlers
could shoot as our men did he would
never have come. Another Boer said he
knew he was fighting for a lost cause.
Yet a third expressed surprise that he
had to shoot at men wearing khaki. He
was terribly dejected. He had been told
to shoot at 'men with red coats and white
collars, and he saw none. His Impression
seemed to be that the men who fought
against him were not Englishmen.
A heavy rain, heavier than any I have
pvor Been, fell Immediately after the bat
tle, making a piteous scene of the battle
lie )'d where many wounded were lying.
The Devonshire regiment captured
three Boer flags. Commandant de
Meelllon of Johannesburg was taken
prisoner. It is reported that Plet Jou
bert, who was wounded and captured,
has succumbed to his wounds. A bugler
boj of the Fifth Lancers, only 14 years
old, shot three Boers with his revolver.
On returning after the fight he was car
ried shoulder-high around the camp.
Everybody testifies to the splendid
fighting and stubborn bravery of the
Boers, but this tribute requires some qual
ification, as I have learned to-day that

their heads sadly as he clubs his rifle I
and strikes at an imaginary foe, say- I
ing softly, "Poor old Amos. Too bad. I
Too bad." Five days ago Lunt first I
began to manifest signs of Insanity, I
and hi 3 condition has steadily grown I
worse until now the man Is a com- I
plete mental wreck. To-day it was I
found necessary to relieve him of the I
post to which he has been assigned I
and place Frank Arbogast In his I
place.
"They are after me, Frank," whis- I
pered the demented hangman. "There I
are several under the bed now. A I
convict is assisting them, and its I
only a matter of time until they get I
me."
During these five days Lunt has refused to light a fire or a lamp In his
room, assigning as his reason that It was against the rules. For several
days he has refused to eat anything at breakfast time, and very little sub
stance has passed his lips during the day. It Is now known that for twelve
nights he has not -closed his eyes In sleep for fear the specters would
wreak their vengeance while he was off his guard. To-day his wife was
sent for at San Rafael, and upon her arrival she held a conference with
Warden Agulrre and Captain Russell, at the conclusion of which It was
decided to send poor Lunt to San Francisco to-morrow to see If Dr. Bar
bette could not hold out hopes for the restoration of his mind. In case the
physician gives a negative verdict Lunt will be taken before the Lunacy
Commission and sent to an asylum for the Insane.
The first time the noted hangman was ever known to lose his nerve was
at the execution of Harvey Allendor. This was Lunt 1 3 thirteenth execu
tion and he explained his nervousness at the time by declaring that. he was
afraid of the proverbially unlucky number. At the execution of John
Miller, the hunchback murderer of A. L. Knott, the barber, Lunt was also
visibly perturbed over the hemorrhage resulting from the rope cutting
MlUpt's jugular vein, seemingly thinking that the accident would be laid
to his lack of foresight. lie vehemently asserted that he had told Warden
Hale five feet was too great a drop for a man in such poor physical condition.
On January 25 of the present year Lunt won $1000 In a lottery, and
absenting himself from his post of duty for more than the allotted time In
celebration of his luck, was discharged by Mr. Hale. He remained without
employment until two weeks ago, when Warden Aguirre again gave him a
position as guard.
In the executions at which Lunt officiated as hangman two men, Han
sen and St. Clalr, were hanged for crimes against the Federal Government,
and he merely supervised proceedings, not placing the rope around their
necks. Not Including these, Allender would be number thirteen on the list,
which Is as follows: Jose Gabriel, executed March 3, 1593; Lee Sing, Febru
ary 2, 1894; P. J. Sullivan. Xprll 20, 1894; Emlle Garcia. June 7. 1896; Anthony
Azoff, June 7, 1K95; P. J. Collins, Juno 7. 1805; W. M. Fredericks, Jum- 26,
1895; Fremont Smith, August 9, 18%; Hans Hansen, October IS, 1895; Thomas
St. Clair, October X 1896; William Young. October 25, ISPS; W. J. Miller,
December 11, W6; ('hum Sing, February 17, 1597; P. C. Kloss, April 23, ! v :>7;

NEWS OF VICTORIES
GRATIFIES LONDONERS
LONDON, Oct. 22.â Despite the fog the
London newsboys found to-day ready sale
for their extras announcing the continued
victories in South Africa. The losses In
killed and wounded were the subject of
pulpit references in all the churches, es
peclally the Catholic churches, owing to
the disasters that befell the Irish Fusi
lcers.
The vicinity of the War Office was
crowded all day by anxious Inquirers for
the latest information. The greatest anx
iety and suspense existed regarding the
losses at Elands Laagte. and as to the
fate of the Hussars, who pursued the
Boers from Glencoe. Among the callers
at the War Office were the Lord Ohief
Justice of Ireland. Sir Peter O'Brien, who
called to Inquire for particulars as to the
Irish troops; Baron MacNaughton, Lord
Stanley, Lord (ieorge Hamilton, Secre

Glencoe; Joseph Chamberlain and Arthur
J. Ball'our, Lady Randolph Churchill and
othrr well-known society women.
Typewritten copies or the reports of
Genera] Sir George Stewart White were
posted on bulletin boards and read to the
crowds amid much enthusiasm, while the
additions to the list of killed and wounded
at Glencoe were received with manifesta
tions of personal bereavement.
The .stream of callers at the War Of

to read the kindly -message from the
Queen and disappointed at the absence
of news from Glencoe. many arguing that

ENGLAND GUARDING
AGAINST INTRIGUES
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â A Journal cablegram from London says: The Daily
Mail says on the highest Information:
"Those who are behind the scenes in European diplomacy at the present
moment are well aware of the intriguing that Is now taking place between
Russia and France, and their intention, if possible, to take advantage of our
difficulties. We very much doubt if these Intrigues have been checked by
the British successes in Natal, on the western border of the Transvaal and
the Free State.
"Our Government, which is perfectly Informed as to what is passing, has
not hesitated to make very swift preparations, naval and otherwise. In view
of what is being enacted behind the scenes in Paris and St. Petersburg,
and we may add, in London, it Is Interesting to remember that the German
Emperor will be in London on November 20, providing that neither he nor
his Government is a party to what is transpiring.
"The French Mediterranean fleet of six battleships and several cruisers
has left for the Levant, where It has not shown itself for two years. This
may or may not be connected with the schemes above noticed. iCothinK
WOtlld be eanior than for the Russian Black Sea fleot to join it v.-hile passing
the Dandanelles.
"On our side the British channel squadron is moving to Gibraltar, and an
ample convoy is being sent with BrltiÃh transports: The authorities at vari
ous British naval ports have been warned to bo ready to send a strong squad
ron to sea, and several cruisers are now only waiting orders to mobilize. The
militia reserve has been called up and the militia embodied.
"The British nation Is ready."
Amos Lunt.
I wise thf>re would be at least some fur

; General Symons, who, according to an
unconfirmed report, died yesterday of his
wounds.
The British transports Pavonia and
Malta sailed this afternoon from South
ampton with troops of Sir Redvers Bul
ler's army corps. There was a renewal
of the scenes of enthusiasm that marked
the departure of the guards yesterday.
Enormous crowds gathered at the quay
to witness the embarkation. All the
transports that were due to sail last even
ing and this evening from Woolwich and
Tillbury were detained in consequence of
the heavy fog that has enveloped the
London district for forty-eight hours, s. -
rlously impeding the embarkation of
troops. It Is expected that they will leave
to-morrow.
The departure of the last battalions of
the Coldstream Guards from Waterloo
Station to-day was witnessed by great
crowds, although the fog was so dense
that from the sidewalks the troops could
scarcely be seen.
Although the fund opened by the Lord
Mayor, Sir John Moore, for the Trans

war. This will be opened to-morrow.
MAY DEMAND THAT
ENGLAND ARBITRATE
NEW YORK, Oct. 22â A Journal special
from Washington says: A hostile dem
onstration against Great Britain In the
diplomatic field Is expected soon. State
Department officials read with Interest
to-day's news from the various European
centers Indicating the restiveness of Ger
many and France and the probability
that mediation by Germany will be asked
by President Kruger after a few fights in
South Africa. It is believed here that in
such an event Germany will have not only
the moral support of France, Russia,
Italy, Belgium and Holland, but the ma
terial aid of those nations In the pre
sentation of a demand for the cessation
of hostilities and the adjustment of the
South African difficulty by arbitration
The United States. It may be authori
tatively stated, will not participate in any
such move.
State Department officials believe this
is the beginning of a general European
crisis, that mediation by European
countries Is not disinterested and that a
friendly offer of mediation by the other
powers contemplates, if not forcible inter
vention, at least a threat of forcible inter
vention.

COWBOYS KILL
FOUR MEXICANS
Bloody Encounter in a
Border Town.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Tex., Oct. 22.â As the result
of a desperate and bloody encounter be
! tween a number of Mexicans and cowboys
i at Naco, Ariz., a small border town, this
i afternoon, four Mexicans are dead and |
â  one seriously wounded. An Amoricar.
I named Ryan was killed almost Instantly.
I his body being riddled with bullets, and a
miner from Bisbee, whose name couid not
' be learned, was shot through the leg and
lis mortally wounded. An American by
' stander was also wounded.
There had been a great Jollification at (
! Naco over the baseball game between the
I local team and the nine representing Bis
bee. A crowd of Mexicans and cowboys j
were celebrating the event at a small can- |
teen on the Mexican side, when an alter- i
cation arose and a figh: started. The Mcx- \
lean guards undertook to arrest the ;
I Americans, who started to cross the line j
'to the States. When me Americans :
i reached the line the Mexicans opened fire, i
The Americans, who were heavily armed, [
returned the lire, and over fifty shots were
exchanged. A train bearing over 500 ex
lonlsta, including many women and
: children, who were In immediate danger, i
! was leaving the station, when several of /
I the cars were struck and the glass in sev
, eral windows shattered. The cowboys on â¢
j the Arizona side of the line immediately .
; went to the aid of their friends, who were
putting up a desperate resistance on the |
line.
While the fighting was at its height Dan
Burges, an innocent party, attempted to
cross from a store to the train, and was
I shot in the leg. Several of l?is friends
; rushed to his aid, but they were driven
( back under a heavy fire, which whistled
; over the cars, in which were tne scream
j ing women and children. An American
i named Montgomery, who was with Ryan
: when he fell, is still missing. Joe Rhode?,
an American cowboy, was arrested by the
Mexicans and placed in jail. His friends,
learning: of tiie arrest, made an effort to
release him, but the Mexican guards re
pulsed their attacks.
The greatest excitement prevails at
Naco to-night, and an armed posse will
leave for the scene of the bloody en- j
counter. The outlook is exceedingly seri
ous, and further bloodshed Is expected, j
Fifteen Mexican officers and ten cowboys '
were engaged in the fight. To-day's
trouble was the outcome of the recent
daring raid made by Arizona cowboys on
the Naco Mexican jail to release ten of
their companions.

MEXICANS REFUSE TO
SURRENDER A PRISONER
He Is Accused of Having Murdered
an American Woman in Texas
Six Months Ago.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 22.â Leonardo Gon
zales, a Mexican who is under indictment
In Brewster County, Texas, for the mur
der of Ada M. Lauva, a highly respected
American woman living at Alexandria,
that county, Is still In jail at Ciudad Por
flrio Diaz, Mexico, awaiting extradition.
The horrible crime was committed over
six months ago, and the murderer fled to
Mexico, where he was arrested. Governor
Sayres at once made application to Gov
ernor Cardenas of the state of Cuchlla,
Mexico, for the fugitive's extradition.
Governor Cardenas referred the matter
to Judge Ahuarez of the Mexican Federal
District Court a.t Ciudad Portirio Diaz.
Advices were received here to-day that
Judgrt Ahuarez has advised Governor Car
denas not to grant the request of Gov
ernor Sayres for the extradition of the
prisoner, "the grounds for this remarkable
action being that Gonzales is a Mexican
citizen and that no sworn affidavit has
been made by a physician as to the im
mediate cause of the murdered woman's
dfath. The evidence of Gonzales'
guilt is of a positive character and
such an affidavit as is now de-
F.ired by the Mexican authorities was
lint deemed necessary by the Texas au
tnoritlos. The case will be appealed to
the State Department of Mexico. The
law-abiding element of the Rio Grande
border aro very much aroused over the
prospect of Goi tales escaping punishment
for h!s heinous crime, and the result of
the case will have an important effect on
the perpetration of crime and disorder
along the Mexican border.
LIEUTENANT GRUBBS

MANILA, Oct. 23â & a. Advices have

BOSTON, Oct. 22.â The Harvard dickey recently conceived a scheme
that luckily failed, for on its success no end of fussing would have ensued
between Kngland and the United States. Sickness of two of the members
selected reduced the daring hand and the proposed plan was abandoned.
Tourists who visit Quebec are shown an ancient cannon within the historic
citadel. It was captured by the British from the Americans at Bunker Hill.
A traveling dickey chanced to look upon it and thought of the next initiation.
He was one of the committee- of arrangements and conceived the scheme of
capturing the cannon and placing it at the feet of John Harvard.
The lot fell to certain young bloods who had applied for membership, but
not until they had planted that cannon at the feet of John Harvard could
they hope to enjoy membership. An ingenious plan was hit upon to conceal
the warlike proportions of the cannon and transform them into that of a dummy
man. A suit of clothes was to be taken to robe the Iron form and the Har
vard men were simply to have a Jolly tussle with the dummy chum if the
occasion demanded. When once the !ron-stuffed dummy was over the para
pei It was to be placed in a box labeled geological specimens for Harvard
Museum and rushed with railway speed to its destination.
MUCH SUFFERING
AT CAPE HOME
Food Scarce and Fever
Breaks Out.
Special Dispatch lo The Call.
NOME, Alaska. Oct. 5 (via Seattle, Oct.
22 I. âThe mines are all closed down for
the winter and there Is no work to be
had. Typhoid fever is showing itself and
the hospital is now crowded with 250 un
fortunates. There have been five deaths
so far and several more are expected to
die. Lindblom, owner of tho best mines
here, is very low with the fever and may
die.
There Is a great building boom now on
and fully 800 houses are being put up.
Lot Jumping has taken the place of claim
Jumping. The fuel and provision supply
now here is not sufficient to last one
month and unless coal, provisions and
lumber are brought in soon there will be
a stampede.
Tho revenue cutter Bear brought in the
news of a rich strike about 200 miles from
here along the coast to the northwest,
near Cape York, and as a consequence
there has been a small stampede to that
point. Another stampede to Cape Prince
of Wales has commenced. A party came
in from there with $4000 in dust and
claim that gold is as plentiful there as it
is at Nome. It Ms believed here that Cape
Prince of "Wales will prove rich. Two
steam schooners left here yesterday
loaded with prospectors.
MORE SURGEONS FOR
THE NAVY NEEDED
Recommendations Made by Surgeon
General Van Reypen in His
Annual Report.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 22.â The strongest
recommendation in the annual report of
Surgeon General Van Reypen. just made
public, is that relating to an increase in
the medical corps of the navy. He points
out rl;at while there h;iÂ« been a t-
Lse in the enlisted force of the navy
for the past two years, while the ma
rine corps has been swelled by the addi
tion of 3000 men, there has been no suita
ble provision made for a corresponding |
increase in the medical corps, which is i
charged with the cafe of the health of
these men. Every Burgeon who is nut
Hi k is said to be on duty, and the de
partment has been unable to supply sur-
I for recruiting and other duties.
Therefore the surgeon general recom
mends that thr corps be increased five
surgeons and twenty assistant surgeons,
and that five volunteer surgeons who
1 in the war and are now in ser
vice l>e transferred to the regular mils
and the agp limitation be removed In thÂ«#i*
eases. There are eighteen of these men
and in some cases they are over 30 years
of age. It is also earnestly urged that
the naval assistant surgeons be placed on
*n equality with those of the army In
pay and rank. At present the army can
! get all of the medical service it nee-ds,
| while the navy can get scarcely any sur-
I geons to serve.
There are now four vacancies in the
rank of assistant Burgeon and there will
Vie eight more during the year, and the
hope is expressed that the corps will not
be allowed to die out from lack of re
cruits, which must follow unless the in
ducements are equal to those offered in
the army at least. The surgeon general
calls attention to the fact that of tho
i eighty-four casualties during tho war
1 with Spain only seventeen have resulted
i in pension applications so far, a most
I noteworthy fact in view of the report that
eighteen of the casualties resulted fa
tally.
ARCHBISHOP CHAPELLE
REPLIES TO FUNSTON
Answers tha Charge That Friars Are"
Responsible for the Philip
pine Rebellion.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22â A special to the
World from Washington says: The at
tiu-k by General Frederick Funston, in a
recent speech, on. the Catholic church In
the Philippines, has caused much indig-
I nation in Catholic circles here. Arch
bishop Chapelle, the delegate apostolic to
the islands, declared to-day that General
Funston's charge that the friars were re
sposible for rebellion was not borne out
by facts.
"The religious orders,'" he said, "have
been In Luzon for more than 300 years.
If during this time they have acquired
: much property and attained great urom-
I lnenco in national affairs. It must be re
membered that they have also brougfit
religion and culture to the people."
Monrjignor Chapelle will reply formally
to General Funston and Is now preparing J
his statement. He asserts that Luzon has i
less illiteracy per capita than Massa
chusetts.
The apostolic delegate to the United j
| States, Monsignor Martlnelli, is also deep
| ly incensed at the declarations of General
j fhjnston.
"The Augustlnians have been In the
Philippines since 1539," he said to-day,
"and have faithfully worked for the cause
of religion and civilization. Many have
lost their lives in thia work. Their deeds
are matters of history. To call this re
bellion the wnrk of friars is to place false
! construction on plain fact."

DEATH FOR
ASSAILANTS
OF WOMEN
Otis Asks for Permission to
Execute Two Negro
Soldiers.
THEIR FATE DECREED
Crimes Against Morality in the
Philippines to Be Quickly-
Punished.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct. 22.â Ma1l advices from
Manila via Hongkong give details of the
court-martialing of the two negro Ameri
can soldiers now under sentence of death,
having been convicted by court-martial
of assaulting native Filipino women near
Manila. The names of the soldiers con
cerned are not given. A third negro
soldier was on trial four weeks ago for
the same offense, with prospects of his
speedy conviction. General Otis had
cabled to the War Department at Wash
ington asking for permission to execute
the convicted soldiers at once. He hau
not yet received reply, and In the mean
time the convicted men were being closely
guarded.
These two mm attacked three Filipino
women. Their first crime was peculiarly
atrocious, the victim being a woman 60
years of age. The officers were at first
very loath to believe her story, but at the
trial a complete chain of evidence was
established to prove the guilt of her as
sailants. Their other victims were two
young girls living in the suburbs of
Manila.
As American soldiers are supposed to
strictly guard life, property and public
morals, the natives of Manila havo
been very free to allow their women to
go among the soldier camps in the city's
suburbs. In this instance two maidens
had gone out toward the American camps
when the two negros seized them. A
great outcry followed the public an
nouncement of the crime, and no time or
energy was lost by army officials in bring
ing the guilty ones to trial. It Is to give
both the soldiers and the Filipinos an
object lesson in speedy American Justice
In affairs of this sort that General Otis
desires to make nn example of the con
victed men at the earliest opportunity.
Army officers at Manila feel that the
respect for Americans will be greatly
diminished if such crimes are not visited
with tlm severest penalties and without
delay.
Six weeks ago news was received here
that Private Dittenhoffer, whose home is
at Vancouver, Wash., had been convicted
of a similar crime and sentenced to death.
! As he is only 21 years old and enjoyed a
good reputation at home, Senator Foster
took his ca.ie up personally with Presi
dent McKinley, who had the War De
partment cable General Otis to suspend
sentence until the papers in the case
j could be received and reviewed.
OFFICER KILLED AND
TWO MEN WOUNDED
MANILA, Oct. 2J-8.-50 a. m.-An Ameri
can officer â was killed and two men
wounded by the Filipinos In an attack on
a launch with General Lawton's expedi
tion in the Rio Chiquita, near San Isidro.
The rebels fired volleys from the shore.
General Otis has replied to the three
Insurgent oiHcers who entered Angeles
last Friday with a request, made through
General Mac Arthur, for permission for a
Filipino commission, headed by a Filipino
major general, to visit General Otis in
order to discuss peace terms and to ar
range for the delivery of more American
prisoners, that the desired Interview can
not be granted, because the suggested
propositions of the Filipinos are vague,
indefinite and unmllitary, and because the
Americans must continue to decline to re
ceive any reiir^spntative of the so-called
Filipino Glvernment.
PROMOTIONS FOR
SUCCESSFUL OFFICERS
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22. â Brigra/ner
General John C. Bates, United States
Volunteers and colonel of Second In
fantry, regular army, has been appointed
major general of volunteers to fill an
original vacancy caused by the increase
in the enlisted force.

have been decided upon. General Funston
has already received notice of his in
tended reappointment and has accepted.
He will receive orders to-morrow direct
ing him to report to Major General Otis
for assignment to a brigade command.

made possible by the increase In the num
ber of enlisted men. the law allowing a
brigadier general for each 4000 men.

96,000 men, the President still has the ap
pointment of two additional brigade com
manders. Generals Lawton and Bates will
receive notice of their promotion within a
few days. The appointment of Brigadier
General Bates to be major general, like
that of Funston's, Is made possible by

major generals to 96.000 men, thus leaving
one vacancy.

cano's Crater.
CITY OF MEXICO, Oct. 22.â Miss Dorothy Bowman, a young lady of
California who is visiting Mexico, has arrived here from a climb to the very
summit of Popocatepetl volcano. It is claimed by Mexican guides living at
the base of the volcano that Miss Bowman is the first woman to ascend to
the summit overlooking the crater, although a number have returned from
the volcano asserting that they had reached Its top.
The actual ascent of the volcano begins at Tlalemacus, a Btation situ
ated about half way up the mountain, just below the perpetual snow line.
Miss Bowman made the ascent from Tlalemacus to the summit In six and
one-half hours. She planted the American and Mexican flags on the summit.
The arenoid which she carried registered the altitude at 18,460 feet. The
daring young climber experienced the greatest fatigue upon reaching the
summit, but was tenderly cared for by the guides and made the descent
without accident.

General Lawton's appointment as a
brigadier general in the regular army has
been generally expected. It is to be given
as a reward for his irallant service in the
Santiago campaign as well as his splendid
work In the Philippines. His appointment
at the present time makes him a possible

tho retirement of General Miles. General
Mac Arthur is booked for a brigadier gen

MURDER DONE
BY TWO ROBBERS
Wound Storekeeper and
Kill Policeman.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
ATCHTSON, Kans., Oct. 22.â Two rob
bers last night shot and killed one man
and wounded another in a store at Doni
phan, which they later robbed. To-day
they ambushed, shot and killed a police
man and wounded another man, both
members of a posse In pursuit of them.
To-night the robbers are surrounded six
miles north of Atchison and an attempt
to arrest them will be made at daylight.
The dead:
JOHN BROWN, Doniphan.
ROBERT DICKERSON, Atchison.
Woundedâ Charles Kuchs, Doniphan;
â¢Limes Hays, Atchison.
The robbers entered the store of Kuchs*
at Doniphan at 8 o'clock last night and
at the point of revolvers ordered a num
ber of men present to hold up their hands.
The order was obeyed quickly, and one
of the robbers started for the money
drawer. Kuchs and Brown, son of the
postmaster at Doniphan, made a move
ment to resist. Two pistols in the hands
of the robbers cracked instantly. Brown
fell dead where he stood and Kuchs
winced from a wound in his arm. This
was the signal to flee, and the store was
cleared in a wink, while the robbers hur
riedly emptied the till and made off.
A party made up of Atchison and Doni
phan men, all heavily armed, started out
this morning in search of the robbers.
Late* this afternoon, six miles north of
Atchison, they came upon the robbers un
awares, the latter firing upon them from
ambush. Robert Dickerson, an Atchison
police officer, was shot and killed at the
first volley, and before a successful rally
could be made by* the pursuers, James
Hays fell with a bullet in his arm.
The robbers were hidden from view and
the posse, at a disadvantage in the grow
ing darkness, were compelled to withdraw
after firing a few ineffectual shots. The
robbers had duplicated their work of the
night before and again escaped unhurt.
To-night they are hiding behind a bar
ricade of logs, with the posse keeping a
respectful distance. At daybreak a de
termined effort will be made to capture
the robbers.
They are surrounded and It will be im
possible for them to escape. News of the
killing of Officer Dickerson caused intense
excitement here. He was a man of dar
ing and well known. To-ntght a special
train, fairly loaded with armed men, left
Atchison for tl)e scene.

PACIFIC COAST INTERESTS.
AS the movement started by the Traffic Associa
tion to bring about the appointment of a rep
resentative of the Pacific Coast to the Inter
state Commerce Commission is designed for the
benefit of all the interests of the coast, it follows there
is no point of the issue over which there can be any
reasonable antagonisms. It is a movement in which
all the forces of the States of this section of the
Union can unitje and work in harmony.
So great is the solidarity of the Pacific Coast in
terests in the contest with Chicago and St. Louis in
the fixing of freight rates, that not even the railroad
which so frequently opposes itself to the welfare of
California can find any ground for antagonizing the
movement. Kates fixed to protect the commerce and
the industries of the coast would not be unjust nor
unprofitable to the railroads. It is as easy to adjust
them in a manner fair to the coast as to fix them ac
cording to the schemes of the big cities of the Missis
sippi Valley. Between the contending claims the
railroads can at least be impartial, and it is even prob
able that if a comprehensive view be taken of the
question the railway magnates may see it will be of
advantage to them to build up the business of the
State and the coast generally rather than to weaken it
in the interests of other sections.
As the maintenance and extension of the trade of
the coast do nqt entail any loss upon the railroads
that carry the goods that are handled in the trade,
neither would the appointment of a Pacific Coast rep
resentative on the Interstate Commerce Commission
imply any antagonism to the welfare of the trans
portation companies. It would, of course, be objec
tionable to have a rank demagogue on the commis
sion using his official power to harass the roads, just
as it would be objectionable to have in the office a
rank railroad tool, using his official power to support
extortionate rates or unfair discriminations. It is not
at all likely, however, that either a demagogue or a cor
poration attorney will be recommended for the place
or would receive the appointment ii recommended.
The movement has been started in behalf of no par
ticular individual, and it is certain the promoters of
it will not give support to any man who is unworthy
of it either by defect of personal character or by rea
son of his affiliations.
We have then an issue on which for once all the in
fluential forces of the coast can be united. It is a
matter which concerns the welfare of every city west
of the mountains and every class of people, Wash
n, Oregon and California stand side by side in
this emergency. Merchants and farmers have a
common cause. It is moreover a movement ani
mated by good motives and seeking only justice. It
is right .that this section of the Union should have a
representative on the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion, it is right that the commercial interests of our
cities should be duly considered in every question of
rates that affects them.

that a wife can suffer no pecuniary loss in the aliena

There has never been, perhaps, in the political his
tory of San Francisco a time as now, when the
"present incumbent" was so fiercely and numerously
abroad in the land.
THE KAISER'S AMBITION.
I /OAIPER WILLIAM has once more made one
r\ of those speeches by which he reveals an am
* bition to pursue a much more enterprising
course than he has been able to undertake, and once
more he repeats his favorite dogma: The Kaiser is
the Government, and it is the duty of the German
people to obey and to trust the sovereign ordained
by heaven to rule over them. x
The occasion of the new declaration of imperial
policy was the launching of the warship Kaiser Karl
der Grosse at Hamburg. The Emperor reminded
his audience that he had long desired to increase the
naval strength of the empire, but had been baffled by
the opposition parties among the people. He then
went on to say: "If that class of reinforcements had
not been refused me during the first eight years of
my reign, refused despite my Urgent requests and
admonitions, refused with scorn and even mockery,
how different matters would have been now. We
should be abe to push our thriving trade and com
merce over the seas."
The significance of the words cannot be mistaken.
Had the Kaiser been in command of a stronger navy
he would have ventured more than he has ventured.
In what direction his enterprises would have been
pushed no intimation is given, but the world is aware
that he desires to promote German commerce in
China, in Syria, in Africa and among islands of the
Pacific. In every effort he has come into conflict
with some other of the great powers of the earth.
In China and in Syria he has had to confront both
Russia and Great Britain, and, while those nations
have not been united against him, neither has either
of them consented to support his plans. He once in
a notable letter to President Kruger gave evidence
of a willingness to support the Transvaal In the con
test with Great Britain, but by the swift gathering of
the flying squadron ready for war the British gave
him reason to pause, and his African schemes- were
baffled. He has been equally unlucky in his ventures
among the islands of the Pacific, for the United
States have stayed his hand in Samoa and have fore
stalled any designs he may have had on the Philip
pines.
It is under such circumstances the Kaiser informs
his people that condition? would be widely different
had the Reichstag Riven him the strong navy he de
sires. He would then, he says, have been able to
push German commerce, which means, of course, he
would have been willing to enter upon war for im
perial aggrandizement had lie been strong enough to
win.
It goes without saying the speech will be noted
by foreign nations as well as by the Germans. Great
Britain involved in a war in South Africa with the
stubborn Boers will find a new reason for calling out
her reserves and making rendy for any emergency
that may happen. The Kniser hns . by no nirnn?
abandoned his ambitions. On the contrary, he deems
the time frwornble to press them once more on his
people. He invokes them to abandon government by
party. "The face of the world." he says, "has changed
greatly during the last few years. What formerly
required cmturies is now accomplished in a few
months. The task of Kaiser and Government has
consequently grown beyond measure and a solution
will only be possible when the German people re
nounce party division. Standing in serried ranks be

conscious of their real worth, the Germans must
watch the development of foreign states. They must
make sacrifices for their position as a world power,
and, abandoning party spirij, they must stand united
behind their Princes and Emperor."
The speech gives notice that William is not willing
that the United States, Russia and Great Britain
shall be the only world powers. It is his intention
that Germany shall be a partner in the spoils.
THE ALASKAN BOUNDARY.
WITH the formal acceptance by Great Britain
of the proposition of Secretary Hay for the
temporary adjustment of the Alaskan boun
dary line, the possibility of any vexatious conflicts
among the miners and other settlers along the dis
puted border has been removed. The provisional
line stands until the discussionover the boundary is
finally setted by diplomacy after a thorough study of
the whole subject. It is in fact probable the tem
porary line will be confirmed and made permanent,
and that the old dispute will no longer be a cause of
friction between ourselves and Canada.
W r hile there was never any likelihood that war
would grow out of the controversy, there was risk of
serious complications so long as the two govern
ments could not agree upon the line at which the
sovereignty of the one stopped and the other began.
The discovery of gold in the Porcupine district
within the disputed zone added to the apprehensions
of the statesmen of both nations and undoubtedly
did much to hasten an agreement upon the modus
vivendi which has now gone into effect.
There is another cause of gratification over the set
tlement of the boundary dispute. It is well known
that the boundary has been the stumbling block in
the way of the Joint High Commission appointed to
arrange a settlement of all matters in dispute between
the United States and Canada. Now that it is out of
the way the commission can resume its sessions and
proceed to the consideration of the issues that re
main. It will moreover have now a bright prospect
of solving all the problems before it and thus render
ing a great service to both nations.
The American people have every reason to be satis
fied with the line agreed upon. In the final revision
it is said in the reports from Washington that the
temporary boundary on the west by the Dalton trail
is placed twenty-two and a quarter miles above Pyra
mid Harbor, which is regarded under the treaty aa
tfdewater mark, so the Canadians are not allowed to
reach any point on the Lynn Canal. Moreover, there
is no permission given for a free port or even for the
fiee transfer across American territory of Canadian
goods, except of miners' belongings. These matters
may figure later, when it comes to a permanent
boundary line, but they are not touched upon in this
modus. The line on the Chilkat River is twenty-two
and a quarter statute miles from the head of naviga
tion on Chilkat Inlet of Lynn Canal, and on the
Klehini River twelve miles farther inland, and the
whole valley of the Porcupine is included within the
American lines. As to White and Chilkoot passes,
the line is fixed at the summit, or watershed, being
the points which for some time past have been ob
served by the customs authorities of the two coun
tries.
The line it will be seen retains for Alaska all that
our Government has claimed. It is not a compro
mise boundary, and Canada does not get even tem
porary possession of a port on Lynn Canal. Secre
tary Hay has once more proven his fitness for the high
office he holds and given reason for a sanguine ex
pectation that he will yet be able to bring all our dis
putes with Canada to a satisfactory conclusion.
CHANCES FOR INVESTMENT.
/"* OMMENTING upon the changes which have
I been wrought in the industrial conditions of
the Eastern States by the development and ex
tension of the "trust" system of managing indus
tries, the New York Post says: '^t is an extraordi
nary fact that while everybody says that the coun
try is prosperous there are a good many places in
which manufacturing has flourished where men are
being thrown out of work and the local outlook for
the future is discouraging." After citing several
cases of the kind, it adds:
"In some of the smaller places which have experi
enced similar adversity the action of a trust is respon
sible. In other cases the result is due to the same
primary cause, even if there is no trust in the industry
j affected â the fact that the aggregation of capital in
large places and its superior efficiency there have ren
dered it impossible for the manufacturer in the small
town longer to carry on his business profitably."
How far that statement may be true of the Eastern
States we have no means of knowing, but the Post
is in error when it asserts that similar conditions pre
'â  vail all over the Union. It says:
"A business man from a city east of tha Mississippi
who was going to San Francisco was asked by three
or four friends to look around and see if there was an
opening for them to invest some spare capital in a
promising industryâ sls,ooo to $25,000 apiece. They
could not discover a good opening at home, and
thought that probably conditions must be better on
the Pacific Coast. The investigator brought back a
most digcouraging report. In California, as easj; of
the Rockies, the tendency is strong toward the doing
of business by great aggregations of capital, and a
sum which once seemed quite large enough to estab
lish a new industry seems now too small and weak
for consideration."
It would be interesting to know in what part of
California the investigations of that expert were made
and what kind of investments he was looking fo^.
It is safe to say there is not a county in California
where investments of $15,000 to $25,000 in some kind
of manufacturing enterprise could not be profitably
made, if the man who undertakes the factory under
stands his business. There are all kinds of openings
in the State for business men with a moderate amount
of capital, and the skilled men of the East who can
not compete with the big trusts of that section can
find ample opportunities here for doing an independ
ent business and making a profit out of it.
That the industries of California have suffered
something of a handicap by reason of the unjust dis
criminations of transportation rates is true, *but all
prospects now encourage the belief that much of that
evil will be unknown in the future. In the fir^t
place thÂ«re is to be a transcontinental freight com
petition which was not enjoyed in the past, and in
the second place the people of the coast are now
in->re earnest in standing up for their rights than
they have been. Taking all things into consideration
therefore we can safely invite the Eastern manufactur
ers to come West. There is plenty of room and good
profits for an almost unlimited amount of $25,000 in
vestments in California.
If local Democratic orators persist in mixinp their
metaphors in their encomiums of Mayor Phelan his
Honor will be everything from a ship of state to an
Uitlander.
It is now clear the "Lipton luck" won-'t do to bet
on in a yacht race.
STATE NEK CONVENTION.
STORY OF ITS MAIN ISSUES
The eighth annual convention of the
California Miners' Association, which be
gins a three-day session in â  San Fran
cisco to-day, will interest the mining
population of the State in many ways.
Besides the important material questions
affecting the industry to be discussed, this
big association and these big conventions
serve a valuable purpose in giving unity
of force and a sense of solidarity to the
mining people who compose so large a
proportion of the State's population.
They do a great deal to stimulate indus
trial patriotism among men who are al
ways proud of their great industry, which
more than any other industry is free from
grinding competition and which does not
create wealth at the expense of others.
While the California Miners' Association
exists to secure practical benefits for the
miners, its members constantly display
an unselfish loyalty to and pride in the
mining industry and its great future in
, California. The $50,000 or so which has
| gone into the treasury of the associaton
I since 1892 has been freely contributed by
men of large and of small moans in the
city and in the mountains to keep the in
dustry as a whole and without definite
calculations of what dollars were coming
I back and how.
The prospects of the convention ap
peared as bright as ever yesterday, full
county delegations which began to arrive
yesterday promising to appear to-day,
making up a gathering of several hun
dred representative mining men. It can
! not be foretold how many of the dele
gates appointed by the Governors of
seven Western States will put in an ap
pearance.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions, which will be the main business of
Tuesday, will in the main cover the scope
of the convention's business and declare
its opinions and demands. Many resolu
tions have already been prepared for
submission and some will cause lively de
bate.
The miners' demands for a Cabinet de
partment of mines in recognition of the
importance of an Industry which produces
annually nearly JSOu.Oou.OOO Worth of raw
material for the industrial life of the na
tion will be again expressed. The Califor
nia. Miners' Association is really the father
of this movement, having been early in
its history the first organized body to
start this agitation. As a result of its ef
forts this demand has become general
throughout the West, and has been
Btrongly indorsed by Eastern influences.
A great many State and inter-State gath
erings have resolved in favor of the meas
ure, and a good deal of direct effort has
been made in Washington. Tirey L. Ford,
who has long been active in favor of th's
measure in behalf of the association, and
! who is the present chairman of the com
mittee in this matter, will report its
status, which is not yet very encouraging.
The Question in the near future will be
mixed up with proposed colonial and
commercial Cabinet departments, and
its Congressional backers may en
deavor to gain strength by tra.l
ing support. The miners' Interests
are now In the hands of the land
department, the geological survey, the
mint bureau and other bureaus and
departments, and are everywhere made
subordinate. One proposed solution, and
one easier gained, is the creation of a
bureau of mining in the Interior Depart
ment, in which the geological survey and
other governmental functions would be
gathered, and which would have addition
al functions directly concerning the min
ing industry created for it. The miners
naturally insist on a full Cabinet depart
ment. The many similar departments of
foreign governments, including several
British colonies, illustrate the value of
such departments. _
In taking up the question of the con
servation of water In an active way at
this convention the association is not fol
lowing the efforts of any other body. A
year ago the association recognized the
vast importance to the industry of water
storage and control and appointed a com
mittee thereon, of which Surveyor Gen
eral J. M. Gleaves was made chairman.
'A. his committee wisely invited co-opera
tion and organized the California Water
und Forest Society. A delegation to
Sacramento tried to get an appropriation
for a preliminary survey of the State's
water resources, but failed, thanks main
ly to Governor Gage. The Water and
Forest Society went into a decline and
lost interest in nestling lakes and bab
bling brooks, but its soul went marching
on as recent movements have shown.
The association will declare Its policy on
this live issue and be an important factor
in the general efforts that will follow.
How the convention divides on the ques
tion of Stale and Federal sovereignty ot
water storage will be a matter of interest
and chaanpions of both sides are on hand.
This convention will be an important
! influence in the domain of American mm!
-! ing law. Its resolutions and committees
on the revision of the Federal mining law
of 1b72 will cut a large figure in the efforts
of the near future to have this law re
cast and to secure Congressional legisla
tion correcting departmental policies and
rulings on this law and the land laws,
which give the miner the worst of it us a
rule when there is any worst to be given.
It should be remembered in noting tho
value and prestige of the California Min
ers' Association that, as it represents
directly a united membership of 9000
voters, and indirectly the entire mining
population of the State, the Congressional
delegation from this State is always ready
to follow almost implicitly its policies
when simply the mining interests are con
cerned.
Another resolution that will likely pass
will create a committee on State mining
legislation, which will be instructed to re
port to the convention next year a State
mining location law and other legislation
to be submitted to the next Legislature.
It will be hoped that this committee will
succeed in framing a law supplementary
to the Federal law that will be generally
satisfactory to the miners and that sug
gestions will be asked from all sources.
One Important matter which promises
much lively discussion is the policy to be
pursued In defending the validity of the
Caminetti law from the attacks whi.h
the nearly defunct Anti-Debris Associa
tion has begun. Suit was brought against
the Kate Hayes hydraulic mine some
time ago and later the Red Dog hydraulic
mine of Nevada County was temporarily
enjoined by the Superior Court of Yuba
and Sutter counties on suit by Robert T.
Devlin, manager and attorney of the Anti-
Debris Association, who brought suit in
the name of Yuba County, alleging that
the mine was damaging the bed and
bridges of the Feather River below, al
though the mine was operated behind a
dam inspected and licensed by the Federal
engineers, composing the California
Debris Commission, in whose hands tue
Caminetti law places absolute control
of hydraulic mining in the basins of
navigable streams In this State. The
plaintiff alleged that the action of the
engineers was subject to review by a
State court, and that a hydraulic mine
could be enjoined by a State court, i-.o
law being unconstitutional in conveying
exclusive jurisdiction to the board of en
gineers. As the very life essence of the
law of 1593 was assailed the executive
committee In July last assumed the full
defense of the South Yuba Mining Com
pany, which owns the Red Dog mine, and
engaged Attorney C. W. Cross at the as
sociation's expense.
The question as to whether the associa
tion should assume the defense of all hy
draulic miners similarly interfered with
or limits its defense to a full test of the
law in one suit will be a matter of dis
pute with little doubt.
Besides holding what it has gained in
the Interest of hydraulic mining, the as
sociation has future legislation and future
appropriations for dams and river im
provements to plan and labor for, and this
will cut a figure. The miners want re
straining dams to hold the debris the
water from their monitors washes down
the steeps. But they can't go very far
into new legislation concerning debris-re
strain'ng d&ma until the Federal engin
eers make up their minds' what they are
going to do with the $500,000 which has
lain for four years in equal amounts in
the State and national treasuries for the
building of dams. They have waited ever
since, and wondered when dirt would be
gin to fly, and they are waiting yet.
It may be announced, however, that the
engineers will likely report a plan for the
expenditure of the money to Washington
just before Congress convenes. For over
two years Hubert Vischer, an engineer
to whom they have delegated the work,
has been making surveys and borings in
the basin of the Yuba River, which is the
stream holding the most debris. One plan
investigated was that of a dam at The
Narrows, but a series of boring's showed
bedrock to lie eighty feet or more deep,
and a clam would cost the whole sum.
For some time Mr. Vischer has been mak
ing Investigations for a dam at l>e
Guerre Point, and Is yet working there.
The whole river and region has ben care
fully surveyed, and several possible puns
have been considered. Lieutenant Ueakyn
states a final report will probably be
r< ady next month. . ,
"There are important questions of prop
erty rights involved," says Mr. Deakyn,
"and if it were announced what our de
cision was in advance some people would .
ask exhorbitant prices for their land.
Hence it would not be judicious to say
now what plan we are most inclined to
favor." . â.
That is about all the convention will
learn of the status of dam construction.
It may possibly begin next year, and then
more money can be asked for.
The mineral lands question is tied up
with the bill long pending in. Congress ;
providing for the segregation of mineral j
and agricultural lands In railroad grants
1 in California and the salvation of several
million acres to the mining industry. The
lation will have this bill to back at
the coming session of Congress.
The mining exhibit for the Paris Ex
positiuu may be one topic. The execu
tive committee by special efforts got ,
the last Legislature t<> Increase the ap- ;
propriation from $120,000 to $130,000, with
the tacit understanding that the increase
was t'ur the i spei lal account of the min
ers and that $25,000 would be devoted to â¢
the mining exhibit. The Paris commis
sion is getting up a line mining: display !
and has secured exceptional space in the i
mining department for the California ex- f
hibit. Under the direction of A. Ekman. a |
tion is being made, and the State i
will fare better than any other one in ]
this field, but many miners suspect that
the commission will devote but a part
of that $25,000 to mining, and besides the
exhibit much could be done In an adv< r
tlsing way. The commission has not re- |
ported its intentions and some are in
clined to kick. Â»
Then there is Governor Gage and the
Mining- Bureau. When the Legislature
appropriated $50,000 a year for the bureau
it stipulated for Seld work in the mining i
regions to be done by experts, to be ap- |
pointed by the Governor instead of by the
State Mineralogist. That was a long time !
ago, am] this la about the only patronage j
rovernor has not got around to. Four j
months of the fiscal year have gone and i
the Mining Bureau has not done a lick
of field work, or rather the Governor has !
not. The Mining Bureau is confining its i
functions to the Ferry building and field ;
men are not. J. 11. Means has pone to
China. F. C. Mathyas is helping A. Ek- !
man on the Paris exhibit. W. L, Watts,
the oil expert, ended his connection with
the bureau June 30. Some questions may
be asked in the convention.
There will be a number of other matters
brought up, and a number of other
features to a lively and interesting three
days' meeting in which sociability, an
-election and many speeches will cut
figures. Some things of interest will
doubtless be heard from delegates from
other States, of which there will be a
number,
Reports will show a year of activity
and prosperity, during which the associa
tion has done much and grown much.
The report of Secretary E. H. Benjamin
will outline the year's work. The execu
tive committee as a whole at its six meet
ings and through its standing committees
did a lars" number of things. The State
Legislature secured, the State convention
on the conservation of water of a few
months ago, the meeting of the Americsm
Institute of Mining Engineers in San
Francisco, the publication of California
Mines and Minerals and the organization
of the Southern California branch were
competent items of the transactions since
the last annual convention. The associa
tion was never so representative of the
whole industry as now, and it promises
to grow much in membership and influ
ence during the next year.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Four submarine boats are to be built
at Rochefort after plans submitted by
Engineer Maugras. They have been
named Farfodet, Gnome, Kerrigow and
Lutin, and are different from the Nar
whal type, of which no more will be built
until the original has established its
utility.
Vickers at Barrows are utilizing the
once-famous trans-Atlantic liner Alaska
as a boarding house for workmen in the
shipyard. The ship is fitted up with din
ing, smoking, reading and recreation
rooms, and has thus far one hundred
rooms for boarders, who are charged.
$3 50, $3 75 or $4 a week, according to size
and location of rooms. Further exten
sion of the project is contemplated.
The German Emperor has ordered a
change in titles of the lower grade naval
officers. "Kadett" will henceforth be
styled "see kadett," the former "see
kadett" as "faenrich zur see," the
"unter lieutenant zur see" as "lieutenant
zur see," and the "lieutenant zur see" as
"ober lieutenant zur see." The new titles
are those used in the Austrian navy, but
they appear somewhat cumbersome when
compared with those in the British and
the United States navies.
The naval authorities at Portsmouth
dockyard are investigating the mysterious
disappearance of two confidential signal
books from the depot ship Duke of Wel
lington. A similar incident occurred about
two years ago, the thief was discovered
and the books recovered. The missing
books are the signals In use of the navy,
but they are not the secret code, which
are very carefully guarded under lock and
key and for which the captain is held per
sonally responsible. There is, however, a
manifest uneasiness shown by the nava.l
officers who are trying to locate the miss
ing books.
The Marine Engineer of London is au
thority for the statement that during the
recent British naval maneuvers one of
the 11,000 ton cruisers fitted with Belle
ville boilers required only three minutes
to increase the speed from 8 to IS knots.
The Japanese armored cruiser Idzuma
of 9750 tons was launched at Elswlck Sep
tember 19. Her dimensions are: Length,
400 feet; breadth, 68 feet 6 inches; draught,
24 feet 3 inches. The engines are of 14,500
horsepower to give a speed of 20% knots,
and the armament consists of four 8-inch
guns twin-mounted in barbettes, fourteen.
6-inch quick-firers and seventeen 12-
pounders, supplemented with four sub
merged torpedo tubes. The water-li â¢,.
Is of 7-inch Harveyized steel, tapering to
the ends; the citadel is 5 inches ai
barbettes and casemates of nickel
6 inches thick, while the conning t
14 inches thick. The coal capacity
tons. .
A new scale of pay has been established
in the Japanese navy. The salaries af-
I fecting officers embrace fifteen grade?,
indicating a very minute subdivision, cor
responding probably to that of some na
vies wheVe length of service in certain
grades entitles the officer to increased
pay. The new scale is an increase over
the old pay, and a comparison with the
salaries paid to officers of like grades in
our navy shows that the Japanese naval
service offers no temptation to foreigners
to join it, even if the Government should
permit it.
Highest pay of naval officers in the
navies of Japan and the United States:

The vice admiral In the Japanese navy
receives $2000, and a chief boatswain in
the United States navy is entitled to $1960
a year after twenty years' service. It is
evident that only wealthy persons can
serve on such absurdly small pay, and
that it is for honor rather than emolu
ments which induces Japanese to becoma
officers in the navy. .
The trials of the American water-tuba
boiler in the British torpedo-boat Shel
drake have terminated with satisfactory
results after a very exhaustive test, tabu
lated as follows:
Four runs of 1000 miles under 1500 horse
power.
Two runs of 1000 miles under 1800 horse
power.
Two runs of 1000 miles under 2000 horse
power.
One run of 1000 miles under 2250 horse
power.
Only three of the four Babcock & Wil
cox boilers were used, end the primary
object of the tests was to ascertain the
coal consumption under varying horse
powers. The first series of trials gave
1.5S pounds of coal per horsepower per
hour; the second series showed 1.60
pounds; the third test as low as 1.5S
pounds and the fourth gave a consump
tion of 1.62 pounds, all of which trials
gave more economical results than
cylindrical boilers. Another test was mada
to ascertain the time required for the
boiler under full power to cool off suffi
ciently to enable the removal of leaky
tubes. The fires were suddenly with
drawn, the water blown out . and in
twenty-four minutes several caps had
been taker, off ready for drawing the
tubes. The average time, required to
take out tubes was found to be ten
minutes.
SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
Threatening Weather Results in a
Diminution of the Crowd.
The people, remembering the rains of
last week, were loth to leave their homos
yesterday and dare the elements, and
as a result the crowds at the park and
beach were small. The drive was ordi
narily large and wheelmen were out by
the score. The efforts of the park po
lice to put an end to scorching is gradu
ally effecting the desired result, but it
will take some time. Four violators of
the anti-scorching ordinance were ar
rested by the police during the afternoon
and taken to the station. They were M.
P. Van Horn, 412 Linden avenue; X.
Lewis, 317 Gough street; Dr. A. W. Baker,
ISI2 Lyon street, and W. P. Longwill, 14
Stanley place.
Mrs. Ja. Berger, who resides at 1818
Mason street, narrowly escaped serious
Injury while out riding. Her horse took
fright near the Baker street entrance of
the park and bolted. Mounted Officer M.
DeLaguerra gave chase and once grasped
the plunging animal's bit, but It brt.k*
away and continued its night. The of
ficer managed to keep neck ana neck With
the runaway until they reached Chicken,
Point, where Captain Thompson joined
in the cha.se and brought the runaway to
a standstill. Mrs. Berger managed to
keep the saddle during the exciting run,
and her good riding was the cause of
much comment. The runaway was taken
to the stable and Mrs. Berger was con
veyed to her home.
The crowd at the Chutes was as en
thusiastic as usual, although some ex
pressed disappointment over the fact that
Adgie did not enter the cage with Wal
lace, the Chutes lion. Last Friday Wal
lace severely injured his trainer and aa
he has since been in bad temper the
management refused to l n t the noted lion
tamer perform witfl him. Adgie's as
sistant, Hall, will take Wallace in hand
this week, however, and next week he
will perform with the savage beast while
Adgie is doing her turn with her trained
animals. Major Mite is still the at
traction at the Chutes and promises to
occupy that position for several weeks to
come.
A large number of spectators was in at

POLITICS MIXED
WITH PLEASURE
AT GLEN PARK
Barbecue of Mission
Improvers.
There was a pleasant mixture of bar
becued beef and politics out at Glen Park
yesterday, and besides the Democratic
office seekers there were nearly 10,000
people present. The occasion was the re
union of the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs. There were games for
the small boys and an elaborate pro
gramme of amusements for the old folks
and tho good looking young women. The
theater was turned over to the office
seekers, who secured a big audience
under false pretenses. The printed pro
gramme told of cakewalks, specialties
and coon songs by well known celebrities.
Franklin K. Lane certainly did not dance
the Cakewalk and no one has charged
that Mayor Phelan sang any coon selec
tions, although they appeared to be the
principal attractions on the stage and
monopolized the greater part of the after
noon telling the audience why they should
be continued in office.
Robbed of its political atmosphere the
reunion was a bip success and well man
aged, anil the person who attended and
did not receive a full measure of pleas
ure would Indeed be hard to please. The
barbecue bog an at noontime. There was
over half a ton of beef, 260 pigs and four
sheep prepared for the crowds. William
E. Leveroni was the chef, and that he
was an artist in that particular line the
manner in which the barbecued meats
were devoured bears evidence. The Glen
lark band, under the leadership of John
Josephs, furnished the music. The com
mittees In charge of the affair were:

Smallpox Scare on the

I None of the transports will leave for
Manila to-day. Tlie work of getting them
ready has been delayed by the rain, and
in consequence It -will be Wednesday be
fore any of them will sail.
A ease of suspected smallpox was dis
covered on the Pennsylvania, and all the
painters were ordered to quit work yes
terday. The Government was not taking
any chances, and In consequence every
man aboard th& vessel was fumigated.
Then the entire ship was treated In the I
same manner. Every hatchway was j
hermetically sealed, and the fumigating I
gas turned on. The vessel will be Kept
pealed up until 8 a. m. to-day, and then
she will be ready for the painters again.
The case may turn out to be only an at
tack of measles, but with a vessel that
is going to carry troops. Uncle Sam can
not bo too particular.
Four soldiers of the Twenty-eighth In
fantry made a daring attempt to rob a
man in frunt of Peterson's boathouse
yesterday. Two of them were captured
by Officers George Lake and William
Mullander of the harbor police but the
others managed to make tneir escape.
Simon Pleff came down from Nelson,
B. C, on the steamer Walla Walla. Yes
terday morning he visited the water front
and struck up an acquaintance with Gus
Jacobs, Company L, and George Sheid,
Company 1, Twenty-eighth Infantry, and
they had several drinks together. Then
two m<>re members of the Twenty-eighth
joined the company and more drinks were
in order. Pleff paid for the drinks, and
running short of small change, pulled out!
his purse with seven twenty-dollar gold
b in It. The soldiers saw the gold
and made up a scheme to rob "the
hoosier."
They laid the plans In front of the
Spreckels Tugboat Company's office, and
w. Mam, ing overheard them. He at once j
sent word to Officer Lake, and he and i
Officer Mullander were on the scene al- |
most as Boon as the robbery was per- ]
;ed. Jacobs put his hand into
I'leff's pocket and took out the purse.
Plt'ff felt him, and, turning quickly, made ;
a grab for the money. Tile purse fell to j
the wharf and five twenty-dollar gold
pieces rolled out. Pleff grabbed three of I
them and the other two disappeared, j
Just then Lake and Mullander appeared
on the scene and arrested Jacobs and
Sheid, the other two soldiers making
their escape.
James McMenamin of Company D, Twen
ty-eighth [nfantry, objected to'the arrest
of bis comrades, and started in to take
Jacobs away from Officer Lake. He was
promptly knocked down, and at the Har
bor police station was booked for disturb
ing the peace. James H. Cope of 1773
McAllister street also pu! In his oar and
demanded the officers' numbers. He was
given what he wanted, and was also
id at the station as a witness.
When the ;>: isosifrs were searched at the
Harbor station a (20 gold piece was found
in Sheid's shoe and an open knife, in his
pocket On Jacobs nothing was found,
but half a dozen witnesses saw him take
t he purse out of Pleff's pocket. Both men
were charged with grand larceny.
Never in the history of the port have
the shipyards in Oakland Creek been as
busy as they are now. Hay & Wright
have .lust ci mpleted th<* beautiful schoon
er Philippine, and next week they
will launch the Steamer Liliuokalani. She
with particularly graceful lines,
and Is expected to average twelve knots
an hour. She is being built for the Wilder
Steamship Company of Honolulu, and is
feet long, Â») feet beam and 11 feet
draft. The machinery is being built by
the Union Iron Works, and the whole
work is being supervised by H. Johnson,
supervising engineer of the Wilder Com
pany.
The ferry steamer Ocean Wave is being
transformed into one of the finest vessels
of her class afloat, also at Hay &
Wright's. She is the boat purchased In
Portland by the Santa Fc Kailroad. and
is to run between Point Richmond and
San Francisco. Mr. Hay says she will be
ready for service on December 1. Her bow
has been remodeled to fit the ferry slips,
her cabins have been changed through
out and her bottom rcplanked. When com
pleted she will be the fastest and finest
boat of her kind in the bay.
Almost a sister boat to the Philippine Is
also being built in Oakland Creek. She will
be ten feet longer than the schooner now
in commission, but otherwise the dimen
sions are the same. She will not be ready
for launching until March next., and will
go Into the coast trade. Martin Sanders,
managing owner of the Philippine, will
also manage the new vessel, which has
not yet been named.

DR. ROBERTSON'S FUNERAL.
â  Knights Templar Escort Their Dead
Comrade to the Grave.
Funeral services according to the
Masonic ritual were held yesterday after
noon at Masonic Temple over the remains
of the late Dr. Henry D. Robertson. A
largo number of Borrowing friends at
tended to testify to the weeping relatives
the grief they felt. The casket was al
most hidden from sight by the beautiful
floral offerings.
At the conclusion of the services the
body was escorted by the members of
Golden Gate Commandery, of which Dr.
Robertson was a member. The Interment
took placs at Masonic Cemetery. The
music at the funeral services was ren
dered by a quartet composed of ivl.
I Lawrence, Alfred Wtlkle, H. M. Besworth
i and W. 0. Campbell. The pall-bearers

Says Her Husband Beat Her.
Mrs. J. B. St. Denis, wife of a carpen
ter living at >r; Ivy avenue, was taken
to the Receiving Hospital yesterday after
noon by Policeman D. Owens for treat
ment. She was divorced from J. B. Sears
recently and married St. Denis, who, she
claims, left her about a week ago for
another woman. He called upon her yes
terday, she told the hospital attendants,
and upon her refusal to give him money
he got angry and broke the most of her
dishes and some of the furniture. Then
he turned upon her, blackened both her
eyes and bruised her face. She said she
would swear out a warrant for his ar
rest this morning.
BISHOP POTTER
PREACHES THREE
SUNDAY SERMONS
Churches Crowded by
Episcopalians.
Bishop Potter of New York was In great
demand yesterday. In the morning he
preached to a fashionable congregation at
Grace Episcopal Church, California and
Stockton streets, and In the afternoon to
another at Trinity Church, Bush and
Gough streets. In the evening he occu
pied the pulpit of the Episcopal Mission
Chapel on Second street, near Folsom,
preaching to a congregation no less de
vout, if somewhat less aristocratic, than
their co-religionists on the other side of
town. In each Instance the eminent pre
late was honored by crowded houses,
every available seat being occupied long
before the hour for the commencement of
the services, while many late comers
stood in the aisles and vestibules.
At Grace Church, where the Bishop
preached in the morning, a special song
service was rendered by the vested male
choir. The text was taken from Mark,
ii-28. Bishop Potter spoke of the neces
sity of the proper understanding of the
lessons taught in the Bible, and suggested
that much good might result by discussing
the lessons of the morning at the after
noon services, as is the custom in Mo
hammedan mosques and In some Chris
tian churches. He quoted the reply of
Jesus to the inquiry of the Pharisees and
Sadducees, asking whence he received his
authority, and proceeded to draw a lea
son therefrom.
The text for the afternoon sermon was
from the Second Epistle of Peter, the
lesson taught being patience. Bishop
Potter said that the text was particularly
applicable to the American people, who
were always in a hurry to accomplish
whatever they undertook in the shortest
possible time. He said the history of the
human family is a history of slow pro
gress, slow but sure and complete. He
declared that when St. Paul went to
Rome to preach the Gospel in the capital
of the great pagan empire, he did not ex
pect to accomplish its transformation to
a Christian city in a day or a year. He
knew that only by long suffering and
ceaseless effort could the salvation of that
people be finally accomplished. He illus
trated his text by the labor, care and
time required in the construction of a
great modern building.
A feature of the song service In Trinity
was a soprano solo by Miss Millie Flynn.
In the evening at tbe chapel, Bishop
Potter spoke on the subject of honesty.
both in religious and In material things,
taking his text from Second Kings, FS-IS.
He told t.he story of the dishonest servant
who was reproved and punished by
Elisha, and said that petty pilfering of
small things and the neglect of small
things in following the teachings of Christ
aro but stepping stones to greater offenses
against the commands of God.
The boys' choir sang with excellent ef
fect, and a soprano solo by Master Neu-
Fchultz was especially well rendered.
Lecture by Father Sasia.
Father Sasia will deliver an interesting
lecture at College Hall, St. Ignatius
Church, to-morrow night, on "The
Wonderful Subject." Father Sasia re
turned from Europe about two months
ago, having spent almost a year abroad.
The lecturo will be under the auspices
of the Young Men's Institute.
Next Sunday, at St. Ignatius Church, as
well as at the other Catholic churches
throughout the city, special services will
be held. Those services were ordered by
Archbishop Riordan before he left for
Europe, and are in preparation for the
consecration of the twentieth century to
Christ. The new chapel for the Ladles'
Sodality at St. Ignatius will also be dedi
cated next Sunday.
CALL'S
Home Study Circle
SHAKESPEARE
For the People,
FOUR-MONTH COURSE.
With the beginning of the autumn-
winter term we shall take up the study
of Shakespeare. The studies are prepared
specially for the Home Study Circle by
some of the foremost Shakespeare
scholars in the country. We promise for
this season an attractive course. The
plays to be read will be presented in the
following order:
1. Love's Labor's Lost.
2. Comedy of Errors.
3. King Richard 111.
4. The Taming of the Shrew.
5. As You Like It.
6. Othello.
7. King Lear.
8. Coriolanus.
The Home Study Circle recognizes the
great fa<*t that Shakespeare is for every-
i bodyâ the salesman, the mechanic, the
I farmer, the banker, the merchant, the
professional man, the young woman of
the home or In the labor field, the busy
housewifeâ quite as much as for the stu-
dent In school or college. Shakespeare
study means culture, and culture is as
much the right and privilege of one sec-
tion of the community as of another.
The Home Study Circle is glad to be able
to bring the beneficent influences of
Shakespeare study within the reach of
the great masses of the people.

11. LOVE'S LABOR'S LOST.
(Continued.)
Study Points to Be Noted.
"Love's Labor's Lost" will be of value
to the student principally by way of con
trast. It is Shakespeare's poorest play.
It evokes little interest either when read
or when played. It is of little account
as a study of character. It possesses
scarcely any dramatic merit. -It lias few
passages, indeed, almost none at nil, that
have value as poetry. Its one saving salt
Is its humor.
It seems difficult to believe that the
same pen that indited "As You Like It,"
"Much Ado About Nothing," "Measure for
Measure." and "The Merchant of Venice"
should also have indited this play. And
yet, weak as it Is, "Love's Labor's Lost" is
a play that no dramatist of Shakespeare's
time, save Shakespeare himself, could
have written. Its faults are those of
freshness and inexperience. Its de
ficiencies are those natural to an early
stage of mental development. It is the
work of a young man. It Is one of
Shakespeare's earliest plays, if not his
very earliest. It must have been com
posed in about his twenty-fifth or twenty
sixth year, when he had been in London
and connected with theatrical affairs only
some three or four years.
It is more than probable that in writ
ing it Shakespeare's main thought was
satire. He had two ends in view. He
wanted to make game of the pedantry
and pointlessness of John Lyly's plays, at
that time vie most popular plays upon
the stage. He also wanted to hold up
to ridicule the silly affectations of the
"euphuisis," the young court dandies of
the time whose elaborate artificiality of
speech, with its cloying smoothness, its
wearisome indirectness, its monotonous
If ingenious elegance was so op
posite to everything which Shake
speare would deem proper and be
coming in the speech of men. In
Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel (the latter,
we must remember, was but a "hedge
priest") we have pedantry exposed, in Don
Adriano de Armado and the king and
his courtiers we have euphuism exposed.
It is probable that Shakespeare had a
third end in viewâ namely, "to laugh
good-humoredly" at the clumsy inef
fectiveness of the pageants which the
country folk of the day were accustomed
to present "at the houses and in the
gardens of the nobility and at village
fairs and festivals." This end, however,
must have been but a minor one with
him. for txie main stress of the play is
directed toward the other ends.
The one effective piece of characteriza
tion in "Love's Labor's Lost" is that of
the courtier Berowne. It is his. character,
both as it is understood by his fellow
"dramatis personae" and as it is de
vetoped in the play, that gives to the play
the point, the zest, the dramatic interest
it has.
The female characters of the play are
mere outlines. Their portraiture is wholly
external. It will be noticed that a good
deal of sport is made of Rosaline's com
plexion. This is described >of course in
ridicule) as being "as black as ebony.
Even her lover, Berowne, joins in the
general deprecation of her looks; for she
is a brunette. "I am tolling in a pitch,
he says, referring to Rosaline's dark com
plexion. All this was in accord with the
fashion of the time which obsequiously
and extravagantly gave preference to the
"fair" (the truth is. "red") complexion
and hair of QuÂ«en Elizabeth.
There are two other points respecting
this play that require explanation. One
is the strained and artificial style of lan
guage that is put into the mouths of
speakers who are intended to be present
ed naturally, as. for example, that of the
princess in act V, sc. 2. The reason for
this no doubt is that Shakespeare wrote
to please his audience. The play was per
formed at court, and we are told that it
gained the favor of the Queen. We must
remember that this very ultra-laborious
and ultra-artificial style of language was
just the sort of language Queen Eliza
beth delifhted in. The same sort of thing
is noticeable (though to a less extent) in
another play, a play also written in
Shakespeare's young (though not youth
ful) years, and also, so it is supposed,
performed at court, "A Midsummer
Night's Dream."
The other point is the coarseness of the
language that occasionally in this play is
put into the mouths of the female char
acters, even those the most refined, as.
for example, the princess and her three
beautiful companions. The explanation
again is that Shakespeare wrote to please
his audience. Female characters In
Shakespeare's days were not taken by
women and girls, but by men and boys.
It was a stnsre custom then, a bad one.
and one that Shakespeare afterward
dropped, to make these "feminine actors"
utter words and sentiments that derived
a coarse sort of humor from the fact that
they were not appropriate to the parts the
actor? represented, but were more or less
appropriate to the actors themselves in
their own proper persons.
The novice In Shakespeare study must
expect to find in "Love's Labor's Lost,"
as in all other of the plays, many words
used In senses that no longer attach to
the words. For example, in act 11, sc. 1, j
line S2, "competitors" Is used in the sense
of "associates" or "confederates." But
a little study of the context will always
enable the careful student to make diffi
culties of this sort vanish.
But there are difficulties of a different
sort not bo easily to be got over. For
example, in act V, sc. 1, lines 344-345:
And when Txvve speaks the voice of all the g-ods
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
And In act V, sc. 2. lines 518-519:
Where leal strives to content and the content*
Die In the zeal of that which It presents.
The meanings that the poet intends are
not at all clear. Nor do they become
clear even after considerable study. In
deed, learned commentators differ very
much as to the meanings of these pass
ages, and aleo as to hundreds of other
passages that might be instanced in
Shakespeare's plays.
Our advice to the ordinary student in
surh cases as these is this: Try con
scientiously to got at the meaning of the
passage by a fair study of the text and
context. If ita meaning does not come to
you after this fair study mark the pas
sage for easy reference in the future and
go on with your enjoyment of the play
It will often be found that a meaning
once obscure becomes quite Intelligible
after one has had a little Shakespearean
experience. But in almost every play of
Shakespeare's there will be found some
passages that will baffle a student to the
last.
Shakespeare's Mind and Personality
in This Play.
Even more Interesting than the begin
nings of fahakespeare's art which we find
in this play are its revelationa of bis
mental attitude to some of the problem^
of life. It was then the high tide of thÂ«
renaissance in England. The throne was
filled by a pleasure-loving, cultured pa
troness of art and letters. The nobles
who gathered about her were as well read
as well bred. The new movement of In
j tellectual freedom had already broken
! down the feudal barriers of caste.
j Shakespeare himself, the son of a bank
' runt shopkeeper in a country village, was
! rising to fame and wealth in the art of
which he was to be the greatest master.
Even before the revision of "Love's La
bor's Lost" his genius had won for him
the Ciose friendship of one of the most
sp'en'lio noblemen of the court. Is the
I young poet's head turned by his success?
: Does he pose as the thorough-going 1
j champion of a movement from whioh he
: had so much to gain? Not in the least.
â  With his infallible insight Shakespeare
perceived the follies and excesses of tha
new desire for learning, culture, refine
ment, and he exposed them with an in
faring hand. High as Shakespeare's
head might soar above the clouds, his
feet were firmly planted on the earth, and
even '.n this merry play of his youth noth
ing is more remarkable and more admir
able than his simple common sense. In
the words of Kreysslg, "Love's Labor's
I>ost" is from beginning to end a laugh
ing philippic against the excesses of a
learning that was becoming pedantic, and
a refinement of language that was fast
changing into preciosity. It is a plea for
simplicity and natural feeling, against af
fectation in all its forms. The- unnatural
vow of the King to seek learning at the
expense of youth, pleasure and beauty is
broken by the natural course of things
and the natural passion of love. The
pedantic masque of the Nine Worthies,
with Its schoolmasterly deviser, is driven
from the stage by the rattling fire of
I quips, puns and broad jokes, such as rose
of themselves to the lips of the laughter
! loviner Elizabethans. The pompous Span
: iard falls a victim to the charms of a
! country wench and is "infamonized
! among petentates" by a country clown.
| Berowne himself, too sensible to yield
I wholly to the affectation of fashion, too
: cfturtly to escape them altogether, is
! beaten from his point device wooing,
| "taffata phrases, silken terms precise."
| to "russet yeas and honest kersey noes."
Everywhere simplicity and common sense
; triumph over pedantry and affectation,
j and the play fitly closes with a nature
| lyric of the purest type, that rises from
the very heart of the young poet late
come from rustic Stratford. Among all
the follies and fancies and witty affecta
tions of lively London he has not forgot
ten the Warwickshire meadows "with
daisies pled and violets blue," nor the
homely sights and sounds about the cot
tages when icicles hang by the wall.
Truly the words of Mercury are harsh
after the songs of Apollo.
Professor Dowden calls Berowne "the
exponent of Shakespeare's own thought."
He is that, and, I think, something more.
It is perhaps too much to say with the
latest realistic critic that Berowne is
Shakespeare himself. But he exhibits so
meny characteristics of the young Shake
speare that we cannot but feel that he
is a portrait, though perhaps an idealized
portrf.it . of the poet. Berowne possesses,
to use Pater's words, "that winning at
tractiveness which there is no man but
would willingly exercise." and which
Shakespeare must have exercised above
all men. Like the young Shakespeare,
Kcrov.ne is a fellow of Infinite jest, of a
dashing, flashing, yet never savage, wit.
Rosaline's description of her lover is
Shakespeare to the life.
A merrier man
Within the limits of becoming mirth
I never spent an hour's talk withal.
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
r<>r every object that the one doth oatch
The other turns to a mirth-moving: Jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor
Delivers in such apt and -â neious words.
That aged ears play truant at his tales.
And younger hearings are quite ravished.
The young Shakespeare must have been
the most delightful of companions, and
the account left us of the wit combats
at the Mermaid, where he flashed around
the ponderous bulk of Jonson like an Eng
lish privateer about a Spanish galleon, re
minds one of the coruscating fire of wit
with which Berowne drives Holofernes
from the stage. Shakespeare, like Be
rowne. laughed at mere book learning.
Little Latin and less Greek helped him
to a popularity which the university wita
never enjoyed. And finally Shakespeare,
like Berowne, at once partook of the pas
sion of the age for making a plaything
of language and was able at will to rise
above it. In "Love's Labor's Lost," as in
"Romeo and Juliet," we find Shakespeare
stooping to puns, verbal conceits, affected
and rhetorical diction, yet capable at any
moment of shaking off these fetters and
rising to supreme heights of golden elo
quence and simple passion.
The Play in the Drama.
"Love's Labor's Lost" has a stage his
tory, but one that is scarcely worth
speaking of. It was played before Queen
| Elizabeth, Christmas. 1597. and we are
| told that it found favor with the Queen.
On other occasions also in Shakespeare's
I time It was played. But subsequently to
Shakespeare's time for almost 250 years
we have no record of its ever having been
' performed once anywhere. In the middle
of this century, however, we have a rec
[ ord o> its having been performed In Co
: vent Garden. London, in 1839. and in Sad
â  ler's Wells. London, in 1853. But since
i these representations "Love's Labor*
; Lost." so far as we know, has seldom if
ever been performed anywhere.
Noteâ The study of "Love's Labor's
Lost" will be concluded on Thursday.

The first Inning of the afternoon grime
on the local diamond guv the crowd to
understand that the Dudes were not in
the race, but something happened later on
which turned the tide and llxed the smile
on wing's face. Brockhoff went canter
ing' to the fir^t bag and played the thief
with second. When Hildebrand was
thrown out by Dunleavy, Broekhoff ad
vanced another peg, scoring on X rug's
single. A bit by Sullivan to right sent
Krus to third and a passed ball
told Krug and Sully that the time for
ucoring had arrived.
After this there was little accomplished
by the locals until the sixth Inning, when
Sullivan made the first bag on a safe hit,
bcoring on Courtney's long two-bagger.
In the first Inning Uutchlnson was sent
to first on four bad ones, was advanced
a station on Hammond's sacrifice, went

MORNING LOCAL GAME.
Sacramento 1, Santa Cruz 6.
For the first time since the beginning
of the league schedule Sacramento and
Santa Cruz crossed bats yesterday morn-
Ing on the local diamond and the re
sultant game was one of the prettiest
Been In this city for many a day. One
Inning of heavy stick work netted five
runs lor the Shellfish and the game went
with It.
It was In the third that all this hap
pened, and Doyle's curves lost their un-
Folvable characteristics. After Andrews
fanned three times, Whelan worked a
single, and hard upon his success came
McCarthy with another, sending Whelan
to the third station. Babbitt took the
stick In his fist and rapped out a two
bagger, which scored whelan and Mc-
Carthy. Babbitt Jogging 0 third on the
throw-In. A slight mixup at third told
Babbitt to attempt a spurt homo, but he
was cremated at the nlato by a lightning
throw of Eagan. Mindful of his pre
decessors. Devereaux worked Doyle for a
single, followed by a two-base hit on the
part of Dronnan. Then up stepped
Clarke, and his hit went over the center
field Fence, Drennan and Devereaux scor
ing, while Clark cantered around the
bases for a home run. This ended the
pyrotechnics.
The fourth inning brought Sacramento
its sole run, Eagan crossing th". rubber
for the Senators. The one sensational
play of the game happened in this inning.
Stanley was on third and Shcehan caught
the ball on the spot. It sailed to deep
center, chased by Drennan. "Right off the
fence he took it, and quick as unharnessed
lightning, sent it home to strive off Stan
ley. Morrow at the plate did not have to
budge an inch. The leather dropped into
bis hands and Stanley was caught at
tempting to ire. The catch was phe
nomenal, but the throw-In was a point
or two beyond that. The score is:
SANTA CRUZ.

In the Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol
Club's regular contests the principal fea
ture was a spurt made by C. N. Hender
son, one of the new members, who has
not been long in the field of shooters.
It happened that D. B". Faktor, one of
the team contesting for an Eastern prize,
was absent, and the vacancy had to be
filled and Henderson forged ahead for the
place. In the match he ranked second
to the best score made. Two scores were
shot in thin event owing to the fact that
the Golden (latt-s started in later than
some of the Eastern teams, which ac
counts for the two runs of yesterday.
The results of the contests were as fol
luws:
Team match for the outdoor life rifle tro
phy, ten shots, standard American target, June

The Naval Militia was out In full force
for the annual competitions for class
medals. The shooting yesterday was for
the medals of 1898, which were not dis
tributed at the time owing to some mis
understanding about the scores. Shoot-
Ing for the 1599 medals will take place
very soon. The militia shot with the
Government 45-70 rifle, ten shots, at 200

COURSING IS
STOPPED BY
DARKNESS
Neither Stake Is Completed
at San Mateoâ Other
Race Results.
Darkness settled down upon tho field of
San Mateo Coursing Park Association
last night before the two stakes, which
made up the programme for its Initial
meet, could be decided. Curtis & Son's
Cash and N. P. Whiting's Minneola
worked their way through the stake and
will meet in the final for the rich prizes
offered the winner and the runner-up.
This will be run next Sunday afternoon.
The attendance was unusually large, as
In addition to the natural curiosity to see
the new park, the best dogs in training
on the coast were In the running.
The hares in the majority of courses
proved just as strong as on Saturday, and
tested the staying qualities of the dogs
to the utmost limit. They were still un
familiar with the escapes provided for
them and ran about the field aimlessly.
Only three hares escaped throughout the
day. In the majority of the other courses
It was necessary to send out one or more
extra dogs to save those in the stake from
running themselves to death. The sport
was spectacular in the extreme.
The spectators availed themselves of
that peculiar privilege, enjoyed by people
the world over, of disagreeing with the
referee, umpire or judge appointed to
pass upon competitions between men,
horses or dogs. bettors are especially
superstitious on this point, and, given the
opportunity, will .Join in any demonstra
tion against an official. They were in the
mood to rebel yesterday, and took excep
tions to a number of Judge Jerome's de
cisions. They gave voice to their dis
pleasure when Plough Boy was given the
decision over Tea Hose. From the stand
it seemed that Tea Rose led up and killed,
A ' no go" between Prince Hal and Golden
Rule, and another between Luxor and
Wild Tralee also excited their ire.
Arthur Massey again proved clever with
the "slips," but in the -Luxor- Tralee
course the fates were against him. Luxor
and Wild Tralee left his hands together
and ran across the Held neck and neck.
The spectators were applauding the close
running of the dogs when some sharp
eyed individual discovered that the
"slips" had broken at the handle. The
dogs were securely fastened together.
They were given a rest and then
"slipped" again. This time they ran un
sighted. As though this was not enough,
the third time the flags signaled an
"undecided," although the amateur judgta
in the stand thought Luxor bad won. At
the fourth attempt Wild Tralee led and
defeated the San Jose crack.
For a time James Dean's great dog Con- |
nemara looked like the stake winner. He >
met Thornhill in the third round. He i
made several attempts to kill the hare,
â which finally gave the dogs a desperate
course. Connemara succumbed to Cash
in the next round. In the second round
Dean's Gladiator met Minneola. Gladi
ator became entangled In the "slips" and i
lost any chance he may have had.
The last two courses were run in the
dusk, and the management deemed it ad
visable to postpone the final course rather
than spoil what gives promise of being a
good contest. The running of the dogs I
yesterday resulted as follows:
Consolation stakeâ Diamond Kennels' Lady

DEFER GOLF HANDICAPS.
Many Improvements to Be Made on
the San Rafael Links.
The fortnightly tournament which was
to have been held on Saturday on the
links of the San Rafael Golf Club was not
played on account of the doubtful state
of the weather. The men's handicap and
the ladies' handicap will be played next
Saturlay. The first prize for the men's
handicap Is a large stein with a metal
cover and the second prize a slightly
smaller one without a cover. The first
and second prizes for the ladles' handicap
are three-handled loving-cups of glazed
ware.
The council of the San Rafael Golt
Club has made an appropriation for the
purpose of putting the links into first
class order. The ground will be broken
up and sown with gra^s seed. A fully
turfed course of an average width of
about 250 feet will be made and it is in
tended to have the complete eighteen
hole course in fine condition for next
season. The ditches which intersect the
course will be put into playable order by
breaking down the sides and putting
pipes in to carry off the water. Arrange
ments are in progress to nrocure a heavy
stone roller to pass over The course. The
work of preparing the ground for sowing
will begin to-day.

WAS TAUGHT A TRICK
AND LOST HIS MONEY
Henry Carlstatt Confided in Two
Strangers and Parted With His
Hard-Earned Wealth.
Henry Carlstatt, a waiter, reported to
the police last night that he had been
robbed of $40 in a Fourth-street saloon.
According to his story h*e was drinking in
the saloon when two strangers accosted
him and asked him to treat them. After
buying several rounds of drinks one of
the men asked Carlstatt to let him have
some money with which to do a trick.
Carlstatt foolishly took out two $20 bills
and passed them to the stranger. The
latter placed the bills in an empty glass
which was on the counter, aftÂ»r telling
Carlstatt that he intended to make them
disappear. Carlstatt became Interested
in the so-called trick and offered to bet
the drinks that the stranger could not do
the act. The next moment he received a
blow on the jaw which almost knocked
him out. When he regained his feet thÂ«;
two strangers were ixov.t: and with them.;
his hard-earned money. J
Carlstatt has given a good description!
of the men to the police and to-day efforts
will be made to apprehend them.

The feast of Our Lady of Victories, the
patron saint of the brothers of the So

' orated at the Church of Notre Dame,
: Bush and Stockton streets, yesterday.
I The edifice was crowded with worshipers

CHARACTER AS
THE IDEAL OF
TRUE EDUCATION
President Wheeler in
the Pulpit.
Okland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Oct. 22.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the State Uni
versity, in his sermon this morning at the
First Presbyterian Church,, sounded the
keynote of his hopes and ambitions for
the young men and women that will go
out from Berkeley luring his presidency.
It was that they should not enter upon
their life duties burdened with a tangle
of facts and figures and believing that In
the parrot-like knowledge of such lists
v.nd dates they were educated, but in the
possession of that best of knowledge that
is attained through contact with strong
personalities. Coming from the head of
an institution where text-book knowledge
is thÂ« criterion by which students are for
the most part judged, the address was of
special interest."
"As we look tack over our years of
school and college life." said President
"Wheeler, we see nothing but a tangle
of facts in the tangle or subjects of a
tangle of courses. We have forgotten
most of those facts, subjects and courses.
It is well for us that we have. What we
have letained is what we got from the
lives of our teachers and instructors.
Their lives went into ours. It was a con
ierring of life, a true imparting of educa
tion. The convincing power of personality
was everything. To those who teach I
v.ould say: Be not discouraged when
those who sit before you seem not to have
learned as much as you assigned to them.
No man can tell what of his character
has gone over to his pupil, and this idea
of character and not books should be his
paramount thought.
"Teachers, give to your pupils the best
of your life. In being true to yourself
they receive the truth. Belief, I repeat,
is more than books. And remember that
nothing goes over to the pupil but that
which Js warm and liquidâ like blood.
Things must come alive, full of life and
lire. Dead facts will not help us. Not
learning of that kind, but personality and
its knowledge-laden power."
Dr. Wheeler tool: as the subject of his
discourse the "Ideal of Education," and
to aid him the Gospel according to St.
John. He showed that Christ, coming
into the world as a light repelled by the
darkness within, filtered slowly into the
hearts of men "as the sunlight through
the chinks of a wall." And Christ's doc
trines gained their force by permeating
the hearts of men, needing no books, no
scribes; no church, no institution of any
kind to become at la^t the religion of
mankind. In this living of Christ's per
sonality in the hearts and lives of men
lie likened the paining by pupils of truth
ur.'l living knowledge from their instruc
tors.

DAVIE STARTS A NEW
FERRY FREIGHT FIGHT
OAKLAND, Oct. 22.â T0-morrow morning will witness the Inauguration of
a new freight ferry opposition to the Southern Pacific. Ex-Mayor John
L. Davie. who, with his Davie Freight and Transportation Company,
so long and successfully encroached upon the preserves of Collis P.
Huntingdon, will again shine In the role of champion of opposition and lower
rates.
Mr. Davie had two partners in his freight and transportation company-
Messrs. Roland an>l Johnson. Hugh Dimond, a Frultvale capitalist, how
ever, bought into the old company ainl the records of the Custom-house now
show that he is the sole owner. The old name which Davie gave his oppo
sition company was retained until last Friday, when the Davie signs were
removed from the old stern-wheeler and from the v.-harves at the terminals.
Not to be outdone Mr. Davie will start his new opposition to-morrow
morning, placing the steamer Emma in commission at once and running from
the Clay-street wharf. Ho declares he is at a total loss to understand or as
cribe a reason why Hugh Dimond entered into the freight service business,
but he promises sharp competition that may make the waters troubled for
;i spell.
UNITARIANS OF
OAKLAND SECURE
B. FAY MILLS
The Divine to Remain
Till Spring.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 22.
Rev. B. Fay Mills, the well-known Uni
tarian divine, lately from Boston, occu
pied the pulpit of the First Unitarian
Church to-day, and it is stated on most
r>-iiable authority that the trustees of the
Unitarian church of this city have pre-
I upon him to occupy the pulpit
every Sunday from now until next spring,
j. T. Sunderland having recently re
signed.
â¢'The Coming Church" was the subject
of Rev. Mr. Milla' discourse to-day. The
spirit of his sermon was in the main a
definition in detail of Theodore Paxkers
statement of Christianityâ that it is a life
to be lived; not a dogma to be preached.
The coming church in the view of Rev.
Mr. Mills is to be simply a preservation
of all that is best in the church that has
md the application of it in a broader
sense to the service of man.
The congregation this morning filled
every seat in the church, and the sermon,
both in matter and manner of delivery,
d to be very satisfactory. Rev. Mr.
Mills left on this afternoons train to
preach for Rev. Robert Wilcox in the
n Sacramento, the occa
-1 eing the fiftieth anniversary of his
churchâ the First Congregational. Rev.
Mr. Mills is also Invited to preach in one
of the Congregational church'-.s of this
city, and in view of his positive Identifi
cation with the Unitarian body the>
es of kindly feeling on the part of
orthodox ministers and people may be ac-
I as a tribute to his genius as a
preacher and his honesty as a Christian
man.
liuring the past two years Rev. Mr.
, Mills has gathered about him in Boston
ry large congregation, quitf inde
pendent and not backed by the Unitarians
Blastically. There his meeting
held in t:> j very fashionable Hollis-street
Theater, an historic edifice as well, that

ITS LAST PARADE.
I The Twenty-Eighth Makes Its Fare
well Appearance at the Presidio.
After rain enough to lay the dust ami
sun enough to dry the mud. the Presidio
I was an attractive place yesterday, and
j a good part of the city testified its ap
j preciation by going out there. There was
, not much to pee besides the hills beyond
. the bay and the bay Itself, but the
j Twenty-eighth Regiment did what it
[ could to add to the attractions. Its last
! dress parade was held on the Inner pa
i rade ground during the afternoon and
| hundreds of people stood around and
I looked on. seeing nothing differentjfrom
the two dozen other parades the regi
ment has given on the same ground. It
was the final appearance of the Twenty
eighth, however, for this morning it will
march down to the wharf and by to
morrow evening it will be on its way to
Manila.
Mrs. Collins, widow of Captain Collins,
late of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, died
at the residence of Captain Brett at the
Presidio yesterday. The death of Mrs.
Collins was hastened by the news of the
death of her husband at Cebu, which
reached her just as Fhe was taking the
steamer for this port at Manila. She
was much prostrated by the news and
never fully recovered from It. She will
be buried at the Presidio to-day.
There was a game of ball on the drill
ground in front of the brick barracks yes-
I terday afternoon, not very close as to
score" but quite interesting as to play.
One of the nines was from the two com
panies of the Forty-third Regiment, be
ing recruited at the Presidio; and the
other was picked up from among the
1 men from the various organizations at
i the post. The ' men of the Forty-third
. won by a score of 13 to 5 after a game
of five" innings. The nines were made up
as follows: Forty -third â Hahrman,
i catcher; Wilson, pitcher. Leverson. second
base; Anderson, shortstop; Morton, third
[ base; Churchill, center field; Acevedo,
! right field; Clinton, left field. Post nineâ

Fifteen patients from the transport
Senator were received at the general hos
. pital at the Presidio yesterday, five of
them being litter patients. They were

DR. HIRSCHFELDER'S FAITH
IN OXYTUBERCULIN FAINT
DR. J. O. HTHBCHFBIjDER of
j oxytuberculin fame returned to
' San Francisco on Sunday last
after an absonce of a year and
a half. Dr. Hirschfelder spent most of
that time in Paris, experimenting at
the Pasteur Institute. The doctor vig
orously denies the rumors of his phys
ical and mental collapse that have
been rife during his absent. He
ascribes these reports to a mistaken
conception of what the Pasteur Insti
tute isâ some evidently confounding It
with a sanitarium or asylum.
Dr. Hirschfelder h;is taken his con
sumption cure off the market. He
ceased to furnish his agent with it on
January 1. The stock on hand is ex
hausted, and it is now Impossible to
obtain any of it. The discontinuance
of the sale of oxytuberculin is taken
as a conclusive proof that Dr. Hirsch
felder himself no longer believes that
he has solved the consumption riddle.
The local medical fraternity, which
was up in arms on the subject when
Dr. Hirschfelder first introduced oxy
tuberculin, now generally discredits its
utility. At the time there were strong
factions for and against Dr. Hirsch
felder.
Those who are in a position to know
declare there will be no further at-
tempt to debar him from the County Medical Society. Dr. Hirschfelder will
resume his duties as an instructor at Cooper Medical College.
EARLY RAINS

ALL INDUSTRIES
State's Prosperity Is
Assured.

BE ATTRACTED.
E. R. Lilienthal Foresees Great Pos
sibilities â I. W. Hellman De
clares 1900 Will Be a
Banner Year.
It Is the universal opinion of banking i
and commercial men that the early rains j
which have just visited the State will
prove of incalculable benefit to every in
dustry in California. Statistics show that I
a wet October presages a heavy rainfall
for the ensuing season and should that
rule hold good there is no doubt that the j
year 1900 will be a wonderfully prosper
ous one.
One effect of momentous import to the
State which this extraordinarily bright â¢
prospect insures will be the attraction of j
foreign capital to this coast, which in a j
measure had been discouraged, owing to |
the dry season of 1897-8. The abundant i
crops of IS9S-9 hardly had the effect of j
restoring confidence in the stability of j
this State for large investments, by rea- â 
son of the fact that rain only came at the
critical moment to save its reputation for |
abundant crop productions. Now that all
Â«itrns point to good times as a result of ,
the wet Reason that is to be, increased j
revival in every branch of trade is looked j
for and a consequent increase in the in- j
vestments from outside sources.
The industry which has benefited Im
mediately by the rains is mining. The
generous" downpour means an early re
sumption of work in many mines, both
placer and quartz, which have been closed
down for months owing to lack of water. :
This means employment for thousands of
workmen, besides the spending of large
Bums for necessary machinery appliances
and supplies. Besides this the rain guar- ,
antees early feed on the mountains, thus !
insuring a bright outlook for the cattle'
and dairy interests. It is the experience
of wheat men that heavy early fall rains

and then little rain until March and April,
have been most beneficial.
E R. Ulienthal, president of the Crown
Distilleries Company and head of the â¢
firm of Lilienthal & Co., who possesses
larsre agricultural interests in the State,
Is enthusiastic in his ideas of the bene
litÂ« which will accrue to the State by
reason of the auspicious beginning of the
"From an agricultural standpoint."
<-aid he, "the recent rains mean much ;
for California. The good crops of U9B
and the assurance that the present rain
fall elves vis for next year s crop win ,
undoubtedly attract foreign capital to our
agricultural land.-:, as well as to other i
opportunities for Investment. As a ;
n ltural consequence I can pee possibin- j
tips of enormous magnitude and an era of
erity eclipsing that of the present
which has been itself high y
prosperous. The rains coming so early
In the season have assisted in the filling

only need an average rainfall from now
on "to preserve the moisture for root
rrops like sugar l ts, the successful
raising or production of which mean- so
much 'for California, where conditions are
bo favorable for the sugar beet industry.
The October rains help the farmer be-;

pleritv of money which cannot be mathe- j
mattcally calculated, but will run up in
the millions and place California on a
sound financial basis which will do much
for its future development." ..Â«â¢_.
I \V Hellman, president of the Ne- ;
van* National Bank. Is another firm be- ]
liever in the bright outlook for this State,
owing to the early inauguration of the :
rainy season.
"It was a good rainfall at the proper j
time" said Mr. Hellman in an inter
view' "and it is the beginning of a good j
season It will encourage every industry 'â 
in the State and the benefits have already
been very large. With a bountiful rn!n
fr>ll to follow, next year will be the best
California has had in many years. All
branches of trade will receive a stimulus â 
that I am sure will make 1900 the banner j
year of prosperity in the annals of the
State And let us not forget that the
present year has been exceedingly pros
perous in all lines of commercial enter
prises.
"The rainfall has already relieved the
financial stringency to which the farmers
were subject in the past, and plentiful \
rains this season will place them beyond j
the reach of harassing mortgages.
"The early rains will likewise be ex
tremely beneficial to th^ wine industry,
which forms so essential a part of the
States resources. It will cause an in
creased growth of vines and an added
yield of grapes. It may not be advisable
to be over-sanguine regarding the
splendid future in store for California, !
but there can be certainly no mistake
made In predicting a prosperity the equal
of which she has never before experi
enced."
MAY DRIVE THE CREES
OUT OF THE COUNTRY
Captain Watson Says an Effort Will
Be Made to Send Them Back
/to Canada. ' -y,; :
TACOMA, Oct. 22.â 1t is announced on
the authority of Captain Watson that the
United States army will next spring un
dertake the task of rounding up thieving
Cree Indians in Eastern Washington and
Northern Montana, and send them across
the border, where for the second time
they will be turned over to the Canadian
authorities. About 3000 of these Indians
are roaming about in the States named.
They are the remnant of the tribe which
Louis Riel led in rebellion in 1!Â«5. After
that war they drifted southward and
have persisted in remaining in this coun
try. - : â 'O r T r ,-
They are known as the dirtiest Indians
in the West, and it is believed they have
DR. J. O. I IRSCHFELDER.
carried diseases to Northern Montana
towns, near which their tents have been
pitched. They have stolen cattle and
horses and made themselves generally ob
noxious. Captain Watson believes that
the coming Congress will pass a law mak
ing it a penal offense for any Cree In
dian to liveÂ«ln the United States, and
that sufficient money will be appropriated
to hunt up all the Cree renegade bands
and force them to return to Canada.
Before the Riel rebellion the Crees were
the most powerful tribe in the Canadian
Northwest Territory. They received an
nuities, had fertile reservations and were
prosperous until Riel and Gabriel incited
them to rebel.
TRUSTS WILL NOT BE
SEVERELY CONDEMNED
Speculation as to the Report That
Will Be Made by the Indus
trial Commission.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â That so
called trusts and combinations will not
be unqualifiedly condemned in any re
port that the Industrial Commission may
make to Congress seems evident from
the general tone of questions put by the
members and such incidental comment as
they have made while witnesses have
been testifying. In the hearings of the
last two weeks, which have brought the
sessions In Washington to a close for the
present, it has been made very evident
that the attitude of some of the members
of the commission toward great corpora
tions have been materially changed since
the sessions of early summer.
It Is realized that great corporations are
now 'a part of the industrial system of
the country and attempts to regulate
them must only be made after most care
ful study, if the danger of substituting
greater evils than those now complained
of is to be avoifled. The commission has
been much impressed with the part that
the great aggregation of capital in indus
trial corporations, aided by railroads, is
playing in building up the foreign com
merce of the country. This point was first
forcibly brought out by John D. Archi
bald of the Standard Oil Company. It
has since been emphasized by witnesses
representing the great iron and steel com
binations and the whisky trust, who have
contended that if a foreign commerce in
American manufacturers is to be built up
and maintained it must be done by large
corporations.
NEGRO SOLDIERS ARE
HELD FOR TRIAL
Testimony of the Thirteen Accused
Men Before Commissioner Mar-
tin Very Damaging.
GLOBE. Ariz., Oct. 22.â The thirteen
negro soldiers of the Twenty-fifth Infant
ry accused of beating with clubs four
Tonto Indians on the night of October 13
at San Carlos Indian Agency had a pre
liminary hearing yesterday before United
States Court Commissioner Charles T.
Martin. The testimony of the Indian wit
nesses was unimportant, they being un
able to identify the prisoners. Sworn
statements of the defendants themselves |
were damaging, showing probable guilt j
sufficient to justify the action of Commis
sioner Martin, who held the defendants
each under $500 bail to appear before the
United States Grand Jury.
The prisoners will be tuken to Florence
to-morrow, where the United States
Court of the Second Judicial District
meets November 20. The Indian police
man whose skull was fractured by a blow
dealt by George Young, a soldier, is still
In a precarious condition. There is no
t-xcitement among the Indians at San
Carlos and yesterday's proceedings indi
cating punishment of the offenders will
have a salutary effect.
SCHOONER HERA IS
SHORT OF SUPPLIES
FORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 22.â
The schooner Hera, with 300 passengers
from Cape Nome and St. Michael, is re
ported by the steamer Lakh-Me, arriv
ing to-day from Cape Nome, as being in
distress in latitude 49 degrees and 7 min
utes north and 12Â»5 degrees and 40 min
utes west, or al/ ait six miles* oft Capo
Flattery, for want of water and provis
ions.
The Hera spoke the Lakh-Me yesterday,
but the latter vessel cmild render no as
sistance, as she had several hundred pas
sengers from Nome, and having made an
unusually long trip down, her larder was
about empty. How long the Hera's pas
sengers and crew have been without food
or water is not known.
A strong off-shore wind is blowing,
Whlcn will prevent the flora entering the
straits, and it is feared much suffering
will result before relief readies her. A
tugboat with supplies will leave here to
night.
SAND BURR LODGED
IN HER THROAT
OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 22.-C. F. Harris
and daughter, Miss Harris, of Murray,
Cass County, Neb., are in the city. Fri
day Miss Harris, while at school, met
with a very painful accident. In some
way a sand burr lodged in her handker
chief and in using that article the burr
was drawn into her throat. She was
taken to the village physicians, but no
relief could be affordfd her and the father
brought her to Omaha.
Several physicians were called upon
yesterday, but up to last night not one
wan found who could bring forth the
troublesome burr. It appears to be lodged
far down in the throat, having imbedded
itself in the flesh. It is very painful and
distressing, the young lady being unable
to eat, talk or sleep, and all the nourish
ment taken since the accident has been
of a fluid character. Fears are enter
tained that a surgical operation will be
necessary to remove the Durr.
CONSOLIDATION OF BIG
RAILWAY INTERESTS
CHICAGO, Oct. 22.â The Chronicle to
morrow will say:
As a corollary of the Pullman-Wagner
consolidation deal the readjustment of
railroad stockholders on an enormous
scalp is paid on high authority to be the
next move on the boards. A financier
with very close relations to the Morgan
financial syndicate of New York, now in
Chicago, is authority for the statement
that the next few months will witness
a sweeping consolidation of railroad in
terests.
The plans of Morgan and his allies, ac
cording to the authority quoted, are no
1< v than the welding together of the
railroad Interests controlled by the Har
riman, Gould and Vanderbilt interests.
PERISHED IN A BLIZZARD.
Nine Men Known to Have Been Lost
in Montana.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 22.â A special to
the Times from Great Falls. Mont., says:
Nine men perished in the recent blizzard.
Five bodies have been recovered, and it
is probable that this is not half the lost.
The last body found Was that of H. Her
rald. a sheepherder. The shei_p had eaten

boots. Several bands of sheep without ,
herders have been wandering in that j
country and point to unknown deaths.

AWAITING THE
SECOND COMIC
Meetings Held by Apos
tolic Church.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â Meetings were
held in six halls in this city to-night to
mark the beginning of the crusade of the
Catholic Apostolic Church, which will en
deavor to arouse the people to a realiza
tion of the second coming of Christ to
rule the world. The speakers declared
that all signs pointed to the return of the
Savior In the near future, and they
warned their hearers to prepare.
The Catholic Apostolic Church was
founded in Scotland in 1527. and it ob
tained a foothold in this country sixty
- ago. The present crusade has been
advertised by huge posters and in other
ways. The adherents uf the sect, which
has two churches in this city, do not be
lieve that the world is coming to an end
and are careful to distinguish themselves
from the Adventists.
Meetings were held in Carnegie Hall,
Chickering Hall, Young Men's Christian
Association Hall, Harlem and the Brook
lyn Academy of Music by English-speak
ing evangelists, and in Cooper Union and
Saennerbund Hall, Brooklyn, by German
speakers. George Lewis, who spoke in
Carnegie Hail, said: "Men have done
their best and their worst to the church
of God for eighteen centuries, and she
stands to-day a sorrowful exhibition of
their devastingr work. It is time to ex
pect that the Lord will himself arise and
come to the help of his loved church."
J. B. Ravenport said in the Saenger
bund Hall: "The terrible feature of the
social arrangements will make men see
that God alone can regulate the nations,
and then he will send his son, Jesus
Christ, again to help men out of their
troubles. Trouble will make men cry
out, 'Jesus, the son of God.' and he will
come to their aid and rule gloriously.
But In his mercy he sends warning and a
chance to repent. He has restored the
Apostles to his church and they have sent
six evangelists to this city to cry out to
repent and turn to him. So prepare for
the second coming of Christ, who is the
hope of nations, as well as the hope of
church."
Other meetings will be held next Sunday
evening. ___^_________
LIPTON WILL TRY
AGAIN FOR THE CUP
Was Favorably Impressed by the
Treatment Accorded Him by
American Yachtsmen.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â Sir Thomas Lip
| ton spent to-day on board his steam
i yacht Erin. During the greater portion of
! the morning he wan busy with his secre
, taries, but In the afternoon he took a rest.
| He saw a few visitors, although hundreds
â  of small boats floated around the big
| yachts. Some of the most venturesome
i went up to the gangway and sent cards
lon board. The owner of the unsuccessful
cup challenger talked freely to a reporter
and chatted for more than an hour about
his plans for the future.
"I shall not challenge for the cup next'
year," he said in reply to a question.
"You see the time is all too short to de
sign a boat, build her and have her tuned
up to concert pitch to rare next fall. 1
shall, however, issue a challenge for 1901,
and shall complete the arrangements for
it in a day or two. The matter must be
discussed fully with the committee of the
New York Yacht Club."
Sir Thomas commented on the proposed
trip of the Columbia abroad, saying: "It
she were my boat I should take her across
at once and you can take my word for it
she would sweep everything before her. I
sincerely hope she will cross the Atlantic
if for no other purpose than to show them
there whai a Yankee yacht Is like.
' Believe me, it will teacta thf-m .something.
"I want to say again that I hav<
treated with the utmost courtesy by every
one that I have met. Never for a moment
i have the yachtsmen here made me feel
: otherwise than perfectly at hom#. I
have failed to win your cup, but I proved
. what I said before sailing for it. that any
1 yachtsman who came for the cup would
have fair opportunity to win it.
"I am deeply touched at the spirit
shown by you Americans in arranging for
that loving cup for me. I shall prize It
above all things. It shows that my estl
; mate of American character is not wrong.
I am at liberty to say now that the wild
guesses as to what the Shamrock cost
were all of them far out. The cost of tne
boat alone, as she is now. without con
sidering the expense of the crew or any
thing else, is about $500,000."
TWELVE INJURED
IN A CHICAGO FIRE
Fourteen Buildings, Including the
Famous Old Grand Hotel,
Completely Destroyed.
CHICAGO, Oct. 22.â A business block in
South Chicago was burned to-day, entail-
Ing a loss of $120,0)0 and painfully injur
ing twelve persons. Fourteen buildings
were burned. An old landmark was
destroyed in the burning of the Grand
Central Hotel. It was a frame building
and was consumed rapidly. The guests
had barely time to save themselves and
fled for safety with little apparel.
The tire originated In the barn in the
rear of Peter Hanson's saloon and spread
both east and west. When the alarm was
turned in the southwest corner of the
Grand Hotel was ablaze. Officers aroused
the proprietors, who slept on the first
floor. Togrether with others they hur
ried through the different floors and cor
ridors, pounding on the doors, awaken
ing the occupants. A scene of the wild
est confusion ensued. Many- escaped
down the stairway wearing only their
night clothes. Thieves made th^ir ap
pearance during the progress of the fire
and taking advantage of the excitement
operated extensively, it is thought.
The most seriously injured are: Fire
Lieutenant Robert Ambrose, head and
back burned; internal injuries feared.
Mrs. Harry Eisbenz, guest, hands lacer
ated in descending on a rope fire escape
and severely falling the last few feet of
her descent. A. P. Atkinson, guest, face
and throat burned while descending a
fire escape. George Atkinson, guest,
badly bruised by falling to the ground
after descending part way from the third
story on a rope.

PHILIPPINES RICH
IN PRECIOUS METALS
CHICAGO. Oct. 22.â A special to the
Record from Dead wood, S. D., says:
Evidences of the richness of the Philip
pine Islands in precious metals have been
shown in the Black Hills towns since the
return of the volunteer companies which
served a year in the islands.
Many of th* L?!ack Hills boys have rrad 1
practical experience in mining for goVd
and silver, and they have h.>. n watchful
of the Philippines for indications of ore
deposits. Captain Paul McClelland, Com
pany I, has brought back a piece of de
composed silver ore, about half pure,
which is said to have been taken from a
ledge about 100 feet in width situated i. n
miles from Manila. The soldiers have
also brought pieces of rich gold quartz
fmm Luzon, the ore closely resembling
the rich free milling veins !>f the Black
Hills. Chunks of gold ore exhibited by
the soldiers bristle with gnid threads,
flakes and nuggets and most experienced
mining men take it for Black Hilla
Many of the Black Hills men have re
mained in the Philippines for the purp"'> p
of being on the ground for the gold
fields as soon as order is restored in the
islands. Several outfits have been or
ganized which are already In the gold
fields around Manila. Some of the re
turning soldiers have small bottles of
placer gold which they panned out of the
creeks and larger streams of water with
common pans. There seems to be large
quantities of black sand, which is full of
bright yellow gold, easily panned and be
lieved by the Black Hills men to be in
great quantities.
MURDERER CAPTURED
Gee Seok Found Hiding on a Vege
table Ranch.
BAKERSFIELD. Oct. 22.â Gee Seok.
who shot and killed Gee Duck, Chinese
merchant, yesterday, was captured at
daylight this morning a mile and a half
from the scene of the killing. He w v
asleep in a pototo hole In a Chinese veg
etable garden. When aroused Sp>K
jumped up and told the officer that he was
the man. "I sabe, I killed Gee Duck.
He owe me money and not pay it. I kill
him." Seok had no weapon and came
along with the officers without any
trouble.
At the inquest this afternoon CJpe
Duck's wife testified that her husband
and Seok were partners in a fruit c .n
--tract. Seok feared that they would lose
on the deal and refused to put up hip,
share of the money. Duck carried through
the contract and made money. Seok
then wanted a share. Duck refused tn
divide and the killing followed. It is be
lieved, however, that SeoK s love for Mrs.
Duck had something to do with the trag
edy. Duck was a prominent Chinaman.

"A Breach of Promise."
Charles A. Miller Introduced his com
{ pany In the laughable farce comedy "A
Breach of Promise" at the California last
I evening. The plot Is a kind of now-you-
I see-me-now-you-don't affair, and merely
introduced to serve as an excuse for a
piny. This fact does not, however, de
! tract anything from the merit of the play,
i which Is a collection of very clever v.'i
-1 riety features. Ther* are especially ono
' or two acts which are superlatively fun
ny, and others very clever. The hit of the
! evening was an imitation of John Philip
Sousa by Burt Haverly, which was not
only comical, but such an exact reproduc
tion of the original that its very realism
had a telling effect. This part of the per
formance alone Is worth while going to
the California to see. Rosa Crouch is a
graceful terpslchoroan artist and acrobat.
' Nellie Sennett gave a very entertaining
! sketch of the "new woman." Burt Jordan
j danced exceedingly unique. Miss Oirard
' exhibited a neat parlor voice. Tony Pearl
and Memphis Kennedy presented an orig
inal and entertaining musical sketch.
There was laughter galore, and the au
; dlence left in a merry mood.

to take him home as he was leaving a

YACHT RACE AFFORDS
TEXT FOR A SERMON
Rev. E. A. Woods. D. D., pastor of the
First Baptist Church, preached last night
in the auditorium of the Y. M. C. A.
building. He took for his subject "The
Lessons to Be Drawn from the Inter
national Yacht Race." The sermon in
part was as follows:
TVe are all running a race, and our life
may bÂ« compared to th* ocean. There are
winds; there are waves; there are rocks;
and when you think of life's ocean, think
also of life'B wrecks.
The first requisite of a swift racing yacht
is a pood model. In a modern race all de
pends on the model. The yacht designers
have not yet arrived at a perfect one. A
Christian in life'g race has a modelâ a per
fect model.
There Is another lesson we may draw
from the race. How carefully prepared
these vessels were. Their hulls were
scraped and polished and cleaned, that they
might offer no obstructing surface to the
waves. If our lives are not kept clean
and pure and bright we Bhall lose the
race.
Yet another lesson. How helplessly the
beautiful yachts drifted when there was
no breeze â no motive power. That is the
fault of many a man and woman. Th<-y
drift aimlessly. They have no end in
view. AnothVr point: A yacht needs a
captain. How cafe you feH In the care of
a good captain. How much his captain
means to a Christian man. His captain,
who will govern, guard, guide him. Christ
Is our model, our power to drive us on to -
success In the race and to guide us safely
into port when It is won.
REV. DR. RADER TALKS
ON LIFE OF MOSES
The Rev. William Rader delivered a
strong sermon on the life of Moses and Its
significance, to the congregation of the
Third Congregational Church last even-
Ing. He spoke in part as follows:
Moses had been sent up on the heights,
to the peak dedicated to Xebo, to die. His
work was done. In words of rare elo
quence he takes farewell of the tribes.
They have followed him through deserts
and battles, In the deecrlptlon of which
Moses has been transformed frnm shep
herd to emancipator. But a century of
events have not made htm forget the good
will of God. Between the extremes of his
youth and old age stretches a mighty life,
the most majestic In Jewish history. Let
us study It as young men living in a grow
ing city and in a time calling for strong
men.
First, we must have the courage of
memory- Moses could read history without
regret. The young man who has seen no
fire In his life, who has been thrilled by
no Inspiration, has lost something better
than a college diploma. He hasloet power;
he has never "come to himself."
A Maori Missionary.
Among the passengers on the steamer
Moana, which arrived from New Zealand
Friday, was a Maori preacher, Whera
hiko Rawei. He comes from Manga
whero, Otahu, a village on the W an
ganui River. His mother, a well edu
cated Moari. belonged to the famous
Xgatiapa tribe, was married to a Euro
pean In the Government service. Rawel,
till the age of 12, lived as a native, but
on being sent to school at Wellington
proved an apt scholar. He developed a
remarkable gift for poetry, and trans
lated Sankey's hymns into the native
.Maori. He "will remain in this country
live monthÃ.
Struck a Blind Boy.
Because John Young, a blind boy, re
fused to allow Frank Slater, a burly
hoodlum, to take a horse from the for
mer's stable last evening, after Slater
had nearly driven him to death during
Tlio day, he turned upon the helpless boy
and beat him in a most brutal mariner.
Young, though helpless, is an industrious
youth and own? several horses, which he
rente out. Slater having used one of them
during the day. Fatrolman C. B. Harris
placed Slater under arrest on the charge
of battery.

Claims That Death Ensued Be-
Cause the Doctor Did Not
Heed His Warning.
Thomas J. Mailer, a carriage painter,
who resided at 9194 Natoma street, lost !
bis life yesterday afternoon at the Pill j
Box drug store. 1039 Market street, while
Dr. W. M. Poster, Dr. D. Maclean and a
clerk named C. 11. Crawford were at- !
tempting to put him under the Influence \
of chloroform preparatory to performing
an operation. During the time that Inter- ,
vened between the man's death and the
arrival of the Morg-ue deputies Â»'â¢Â» in gold .
â was taken from his pocKets. John F. Me- |
Cann. who accompanied [alley, throws
the responsibility of the missing money
on Dr. Poster, proprietor of the Pill Box. ;
He also charges that the man's death was (
due to the unskillful manner iv which the
anaesthetic was administered. Dr. Foster
asserts that he saw McConn remove the
money from the pockets of his dead
friend. All of the doctor's statements do j
not agrree. He told one story to the I
Morgue deputies, and, later in the even-
Ing gave aa entirely different version of ;
the affair.
According to the statement of McCann. â¢
who was a member of the hospital corps I
at Manila, he was a friend of MaUey. Mal
ley had asked him earlier In the day for
financial aid to have the operation per- ,
formed, and Just before the two went to
the Pill Box McCann gave him JlO which ':
the painter placed in a buckskin bag in
his trousers pocket.
"While they were administering the
chloroform," said McCann, "I felt Mal
ley's pulse, and, noticing that it was get- ;
ting very weak, cautioned the doctors.
Dr. Maclean replied that he was getting
along all right, and that there was noth- ;
ing to fear. [stepped back for a few mo- i
ments when the clerk, who was assisting
Poster to administer the drug, whispered j
something to him, anu aim immediate
ly the operating table was tipped up and
the trio attempted to resuscitate the man j
by means of artificial respiration.
""After working over him for some time
they threw up their hands and, looking
nt me â¢ alingly, announced that they
could do nothing more and that Malley
was dead. They were very much ex
cited and rushed around the place like
a lot of crazy men. I left almost im
mediately after assisting in dressing Mal
ley. At that tin he had in his pockets
the money that 1 had given him. A
thing thut struck me peculiarly was the :
evident desire of Foster and his clerk to I
get me to leave as soon "as possible."
The Morgue officials say that the first
thing Poster told them when they visited
his place was that McCann had taken
flO from the ad man's clothing and was
probably spending it getting drunk. â  The
lit'iiuties found a small amount of sliver !
and the empty buckskin pouch in Mal
ley's pockets. The top of the pouch had
been cut open.
Dr. Foster asserted last evening that
Malley died from cardiac spasm.
"It was one of those cases," he said,
"that we cannot foresee. He was talk
ing to us almost a minute before he
showed signs of apse. The man Mc-
Cann is no pood He is trying to give ,
me n black eye because I told the deputies j
that he took that money. He did take it, i
and I can prove it by my clerk."
Within the past month the Coroner has
had to investigate several cases with
which Dr. Foster has been connected.

My baby had a terrible breaking out all over
bis face .tad head, extending half way down his
back, while his arm became one solid, scaly,
bleeding Bore. A physician gave me a prescrip-
tion which I used, bat he kept getting worse,
and Buffered beyond description. The pain be-
came so intense that he hud to bo put und#r
Opiates. We could get no rest, night or day. He
dwindled down to a mere skeleton. Everybody
who saw him said he would surely die. As a
last resort a trip to the country was suggested,
that the change of air might do him good. As
soon as ray mother saw the child she got a copy
of an Atlanta paper, in which there wan an ac-
count of a wonderful cure Ccticcra Remedies
had wrought on a two-year-old child. My father
started to the nearest drug store, which was fivo
miles, and purchased Ccticcra (ointment), Cu-
ticcba Soap, and Conctnu Resolvext. We
applied as per directions putting plenty of the
CcTlcfHA on his head, face, arm, and back.
The child slept for over tiro hours that night,
improved daily, and in nine weeks from the time
he started on the Ccticcra Remedies we were
able to discontinue their use, and not a sign if
left to tell of his awfnl sufferings.

Secretary Benjamin was on hand ami
was assisted in headquarters' business of
reception and preparation by J. E. Doug

Many leading members of the convention
were there to welcome delegates. Secre
tary Benjamin had received notice of the
appointment of over 600 delegates from
twenty-five counties ami seven other
\V.-stÂ«irn States, the Governors of which
were asked to name ten delegates each.
How many delegates from other mining
States will attend will not be known un
til to-day. Yesterday Thomas Tonge of
Denver, a mining man and correspondent
of several Important mining publications,
arrived as a representative of Colorado,
and J. A. Blossom of Battle Mountain
came as a delegate from Nevada, Wash

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1899.
Kmprpss of India. Captain J. B. Patter
son, master of the vessel, had sailed Pa
cific seas too long not to know thut there
was something doing before he left the
Japanese r>>rt, and would take im
ohance. The wr-ather, however, was
rough for three days, and two days out
uas.iki nearly resulted in two fa
taiiU. s. The boat was bowling along un
ttean and sail when the after sheet
gave way and Privates Edwin Stotler,
Company M. and Homer A. Read, Com
pany A, wore seriously injured. Stotler's
[eg was broken and Read suffered a com
pound fracture of the skull. Everything
was done for the two men and they are
now on the high road to recovery. Pri
vate Edward Kissick. Company F, died
of dysentery In Nagasaki Bay. His body

The transport was wholly given up to
tin- Lowa regiment, only five passengers
and two stowaways being registered on
the books of Purser J. A. Sargent. The
rÂ»'KimÂ»-nt as it returns numbers 764 en
listed men and 4G officers and not one
among them but bears in his face and
physique the record of the things he has
1k en through. Eight months of every
i work at the places where the march-
ing was hardest and the fighting fiercest,
made wrecks of the best of them, and not
even the thirty-day trip over seas has
served to give them the health and color
that was theirs when they sailed away.
That the officers have suffered with their
rru-n Is as evident as that the men have
suffered. Colonel Loper returns a shadow
of himself; shy, thanks to fevers ami
nights in sickening swamps, fifty pounds
of tho flesh he carried away from Camp
Merritt; ami In that respect Colonel
Loper is merely one of the 45 officers on
board the boat.
With the Colonel return his wife. Mrs.
J. C. I,oper. who made her headquarters
in Manila during the months her husband
was out in the lighting. Mrs. H. P. Wll
liams, wife of the chaplain, was also a
passenger, as were Mrs. J. Edaburn and
Captain (5. K. Sage of the Sixth Artillery.
and lieutenant J. J. O'Connell of the
Twenty-fir.n Infantry, who have been act
ing as mustering officers on the other
side.
It was half past 1 In the afternoon
150 to arrivp, and in the evening was fol
lowed by many more. E. C. Voorhies of
Aitiiitlur, who is much talked of for the
presidency of the association, dropped in
during the afternoon, as did A. Caminetti
of the same county.
J. F. Halloran, chairman of a special
committee to suggest matters to be
tit before the convention, was
among those who were actively at â work.
In the evening the committee on dams, of
which A. Caminetti is chairman, and the
committee on legislation, of which John
P. Davis of Amador is chairman, held
meetings.
The proceeding to-day will consist
largely of organization, the reading of the
president's annual address, filing of re
ports, and addresses of welcome by
Mayor Phelan, Senator Perkins, Con
gressjnen do Vriea and Kahn, and others.
I aesday will be the most important work
in:-,- day of the convention. In the evening
Marsden Mansen will deliver a public ad
dress at Golden Gate Hall on the "De
nudation of the Watershed," illustrated
by stereoptlcon views.
There is a good deal of early gossip
about the election of officers which will
occur on AN ednesday, but the prospects
pi tho election will not evolve much that
is definite until to-day. J. H. Neff, who
has lit-en unanimously re-elected presi
dent since organization in 1.592, has posi
tively declined to serve again. He de
clined last y.u\ when U". C. Kalston and

Mr. Neff finally consented to re-election

candidate of the Nevada delegation and

"Voorhies is a mining man and a
mountain man, vigorous, an active mem

There will be much convention politics

be a warm one.
before any of the reception parties who
had taken tugs could get aboard. The
quarantine officers took some little time
in giving the vessel a clean bill of health,
but when they had done so Adjutant Gen
eral Seamans, from the Governor Mark

and the State's felicities. Adjutant Gen

F. Dockery, representing them, went

and his mm the freedom of the city and

transport weighed her anchors and pulled
up the stream. She let go again near
the battleship lowa and then the jackles
of the warship let go three cheers at
the men of the regiment, that could be
heard by all the shipping along the front |
and the men on the transport sent them
back as lustily. The bands on the tugs
started up their music and the band on
the transport did the same thing. A j
lot of pretty girls on the Irwln, who
could not get aboard, struck up a cake
walk and the racket was still on when
the boy? were called aft to the galley
for supper. The boat will dock this morn
ing and the regiment will take the usual
route to camp.

CAPTURE OF A
FAMOUS CROOK
AND HIS "KIT"
Burglar Savage Again
in Prison.
Police Officer Gelman made an Impor
tant capture early yesterday morning in
the person of George Savage, an ex-con-
vict. While patrolling his heat on Grant
avenue Geiman saw Savage emerging
from a lodging-house nt-ar Bush street.
Suspecting that he was about to "turn a
trick" the policeman decided to stand
him up. In his pockets were found a
bunch of skeleton keys, a candle and a ;
"jimmy." Concealed in hs coat were two
knives, one a dirk and the other a case
knife, such as is used by burjjlars in forc
ing open windows. When asked what he
was doing with the tools Savage said that
he had been given them by a friend to
take to his room. Geiman at once slipped
the handcuffs on Savage's wrists and took
him to polfi â¢â  headquarters, where he â¢as
charged with vagrancy.
To-day additional charges of burglary
and carrying burglar tools and having
concealed weapons in his possession will
be recorded against him. The police are
strongly Inclined to believe that he is the
lone burglar who has been operating in
the Western Addition. Last night two of
Chief Lees' men searched his room with
out finding any plunder.
Savage is considered a dangerous crook
and since his release from the peniten
tiary the police have been watching him.
as they knew he would follow his natural
propensity for taking other people's prop
erty. The skeleton keys which were
found on ..im are of expert workmanship
and would unlock almost any ordinary
door.
