MURDER AND RIOT IN
CLEVELAND'S STREETS
Youth Shot Down by a Conductor, and
Additional Explosions.
Arbitrators Abandon Efforts to Conciliate the Strikers, and
Sympathizers Are Only Held in Check by
Police and Militia.
Â§EVELAND. July 24.-The day
has failed to bring any relief
\ . to the strike situation, which is
V *â ' ' regard* as serious. Th^ State
if Arbitration has practically
abandoned its efforts to conciliate the
rtrikers and their former employers.
_ __ _
The resentment of the conductors and
motormen who quit work and the
more turbulent spirit of their sym- \
pathizers-is held in check to a degree
by the presence of the police and
militia. Small riots occurred during
the day. but with one exception they
were without serious results.
In the death of Henry Cornweil,
slain by a bullet fired by Ralph P.
Hawley a conductor on the Broadway
line, is the first fatality recorded of the
strike. Shortly after noon Hawley's
car was approaching Orange street and
was beset by a crowd of men and boys.
Cornweil, the 19-year-old son of a
butcher, was astride a horse and rode
to the side of the car. keeping pace
with it for some distance. Various
stories are told as to what passed be
tween the conductor and the boy, but
the mob was suddenly called to its
senses by the sight of Hawley, who
Jumped to the street and started in
pursuit of .well. The latter, closely
followed by his pursuer, turned up
Perry street. At Woodland avenue the
latter drew his revolver and fired. His
victim fell, with a ghastly wound in
the left temple, and died soon after be
ing removed to the hospital.
The crowd, which before the incident
had been so violent, was awed by the
seriousness of the affair and permitted
the conductor to walk back to hi; car.
He was arrested and taken to the sta
tion, where a charge of murder was en
tered against him. When. the. car re
turned in charge of another man. this
time laden with police, thousands of
people crowded around the fatal spot.
The track was blockaded and the
stalled cars bombarded with stones.

The police managed by dint of using
their clubs to clear the way after a de
lay of about half an hour. -

WHY SECRETARY HAY
REFUSES TO ARBITRATE
Firm in the Belief That the United
States Is Bight in the Boun

WASHINGTON. July 24. as
the Canadian officials have laid stress
upon the refusal of the United States to
accept fair arbitration of the pending
question, it may be proper to explain the
reason for the refusal as pointed out to
day by a high official.
In the first place our Government, it
is contended, is absolutely certain of the
soundness of Its claims ih the matter of
the boundary. That would seem to be a
good reason for submitting the matter

With the exception of the Mayfleld

A number of police officers testified to

the men.
William Ashby. employed by the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company to

It is feared a similar unfortunate condi

expensive side plating will be submerged

OLD BOSSES FALL OUT
AND HONEST MEN REJOICE
Christopher Buckley, Fiercely Assailed by the
Rainey-Lawrence Combine, Threatens to
Fight Accusers to a Finish.
Ugly Secrets of the Past Divulged â The Knife Was Out for
Senator Whiteâ An Electric Franchise Scheme.
CHRISTOPHER A. BUCKLEY.
The war among the Democratic bosses is on. Buckley,
who was fiercely assailed by the Examiner yesterday, retaliates
and divulges many of the ugly political secrets of the past. He
asserts that Rainey is behind the Examiner, and that the Fire
Department is the chief element of strength in the combine.
The assailed boss believes that W. R. Hearst, who tried to
knife Stephen M. White, is a candidate for United States Sena
tor. Buckley asserts that the present -managing editor of the
Examiner once followed him on the streets, hat in hand, beg
ging to be nominated for the Legislature.
THE expected has happened. The
bosses have falter out and the j
honest citizens now* stand a fair
chance of getting their dues. The
Examinees open "att ' on Chris
Buckley clears away all doubt as to the
present relation of Rainey and Buck
ley. These old-time bosses of the Dem
ocratic party are at war one with the
other. It is known as an absolute cer
tainty that Rainey was recently taken
Into the confidence of the Examiner.
Every politician on the inside is dis
cussing the new combine and wonder
ing why Gavin McNab is excluded from
the councils of the paper. The leading
men in the Committee of One Hun
dred appear to be dumfounded at the
remarkable turn of affairs. Jasper Mc-
Donald, chairman of the committee,
cannot account for the peculiar posi
tion of the Democratic organ. The fact
has not escaped the observation of the
committee that Rainey and the Exami
ner are endeavoring to organize clubs
and bring to their support men who
have been active in Democratic poli
tics and whose allegiance was counted
upon to bolster up the McNab column.
The Buckley broadside in yesterday's
Examines makes the fact clear to all
factions that the fight between Rainey
and Buckley is on and will be fought
to the finish. bvv
Buckley is resolved to fight. He pro
poses to give the Examiner as good as
it sends. In one sense this strife.be
tween Buckley and the Examiner is un
natural, as the boss is responsible for
the existence of the paper as a morning
glory of the Democratic party. Buck
ley advised Hearst to buy it, and when
no one happened around to pay its bills
its conductors went to Buckley's saloon
and borrowed money to pay the hired
help. -'' â ."- :'-â '" â¢'- '.'
It is rumored that Huntington. Her
rin and others of the Southern Pacific
monopoly brought Buckley back into
the political arena to lead the Demo
cratic party. Events at Sacramento last
winter, and subsequent events in San
Francisco, convinced the railroad man
agers that the Republican party con
tained within its ranks so many inde
pendent and courageous men that the
monopoly could not control the rank
and file of the organization.
The agents of the monopoly have
since turned their attention to the man
agement of Democratic politics. If
Herrin is behind Buckley the meaning
of the position is that the railroad j
fancies that Buckley is stronger than j
Rainey. : -;>;; . {:J, : 7%'v : f:i~l't~i â â â >'<'-
The Call is glad that the Democratic
fight is on. Truth regarding many
shady and corrupt bargains of the past
may be brought to light. If Buckley
decides to speak out and tell all he
knows about corruption in politics and
the tactics of paid newspaper agents of
corruption, the exposure will redound
to the public good. Buckley has prom
ised to tell it all. The first chapter ap
pears in The Call to-day. This journal,
however, will not take sides in the con
troversy. It offers to the Examiner the
same opportunity that it gives to Buck
ley. Rainey likewise may tell of Buck
ley rascality, and The Call will publish
it. If Gavin McNab wants to intervene
and tell what he knows about both of
the bosses The Call will give him a fair
field. In fact, Herrin himself will not
be denied a fair hearing.
Last night Buckley was invited to
explain why the Examiner-Rainey
combine so furiously assailed him.
"I have been told on good authority,"
said Buckley, "and there Is no question
in my mind as to the truth of the as
sertion, that Hearst, the proprietor of
the Examiner, is a candidate for United
States Senator. He was out here last
fall and put money in some of these
legislative fights. The article which
appeared in this morning's Examiner
is a whole tissue of lies from beginning
to end. I never was an inspector in a
primary or general election. I was in
Vallejo as a business man and not as
a politician."
Speaking of Rainey and the paper he
controls. Buckley said: "They have
sent for dozens of my following and
told them to have nothing to do with
me. I anticipated this assault and told
my friends that the paper would at
tack me. This fellow Rainey has fur
nished the information, but I don't
want to mention his name. He is be
neath my notice." -V _
Buckley mentioned as an incident of
his career as a political manager that
he conducted the Senatorial contest for
George Hearst. He hesitated a min
ute, and then replied: "Later on I
will tell the people the secret of that
Senatorial contest. Let the Examiner
continue its attacks."
Continuing. Buckley made his state
ment in these words:
â¢'I was a conductor on the first street
car, ever run in this city. It was an
occupation a blackmailer never ascends
to. I also kept saloons, but they were
places where the manager and proprie
tor of the 'Mud Mill' would not be tol
erated. I never was a member of the
Republican County Committee, either
here or in Solano.
"I understood that this article was to
be published. I knew that it .was.be
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ing prepared and would he published.
I also understood that the managing
editor of the 'Mud Mill' was telling all
my followers to keep away from me: to
have nothing to do with me. The stuff
printed is simply a rehash of what has
already appeared in the past ten years.
"Many years ago 1 was actively en
gaged with a Â°*entleman named A. J.
Fritz, as members of the Democratic
organization. W. D. English and other
gentlemen who were members of the
State Committee at that time had the
idea that they wanted a Democratic
organ, and they requested George
Hearst, the mining man, who was
afterward Senator, to purchase the Ex
aminer, which he djd. and turned it into
a morning paper, with W. T. Baggett
as managing editor and W. H. Davis
as business manager. Both gentlemen
are living now and are in this city.
Often when the proprietor was out of
town these gentlemen would come to
me for money and I would advance
them $500, $700 and $1000 to keep that
'Mud Mill' from going to pieces.
"In 1875 Mr. Fritz and myself had
built up a Democratic organization, and
through the aid of the people who were
co-operatins: with us we managed to
elect a ticket in that year lÃ7s. In 1877
we elected a portion of the ticket. In
1579 the workingmen absorbed the
Democratic party, with the exception
of about 4000 votes, which we polled. In
1580 we compromised with the Working
men's party and carried the city for
Hancock. In 1881, during the delibera
tions of the Democratic convention, the
character of men who presented them
selves was such that I advised against
accepting them. They would not heed
my advice and went to the convention
and nominated them. I then told them
they would be defeated, and my prog
nostication came true, as they were
ignomlniously defeated by 5000 or 10,000
votes.
â¢'After the defeat of 1881 we then had
in existence a Democratic State Club,
which appointed a committee consist
ing of Washington Bartlett, Joseph
Clark, Judge Hager and two other gen
tlemen for the purpose of bringing
about a reorganization of the Demo
cratic ! party. I. suggested to the com
mittee a plan that the desired result
might be brought about. It was that
the Executive Committee of the State
Central Committee should appoint a
committee of twenty-five and a county
committee of twenty-five, making a
total of fifty. That the County Com
mittee should turn over all its rights to
this committee of fifty, and the com
mittee of fifty was then to formulate
a plan for the reorganization of the
party. This was done and from that
originated the forty-seven precinct
clubs.
"After the clubs were organized
George Hearst came to me and re
quested me to take charge of his con
test for the nomination of Governor of
this State. We secured a large majority
of the San Francisco delegation and
balloted for him for five days at the
Democratic State convention which met
thai year in San Jose. The local ticket
which was nominated that year by the
convention selected by the forty-seven
district clubs, which met in Union Hall,
nominated Washington Bartlett for
Mayor, a Board of Supervisors which
embraced E. B. Pond, J. Henley Smith,
F. S. Strother, Thomas Ashworth. Jef
ferson G. James and others and a whole
municipal ticket. It was elected by up
ward of 10,000 majority.
â¢ "The administration of that govern
ment from 1883 to 1885 is before the peo
ple. It was the best administration of
public affairs that this city has ever
had. In 1884, when, according to this
newspaper. 1 had sold out the party,
Blame carried the State by 4000 ma
jority. Notwithstanding that, we
elected the Mayor, Auditor. County
Clerk. Public Administrator. Mr. Pond
for Supervisor and some other officers.
In 1886 we elected the ticket. In ISRS
we elected the ticket. In 1890. when Mr.
Stanford was a candidate for United
States Senator, his legislative ticket re
ceived 42,000 majority. In that election
Mr. Pond, the Democratic candidate for
Governor, carried the city by a smtil
majority and the local Democratic
ticket received 28,006 votes. 5000 more
than any local ticket has received
since. This is the time referred to in
this article that the city was being
looted and robbed, and during this time
this same managing editor, 'Long
Green' Lawrence, was seen to follow
me around with his hat in his hand,
begging me for a nomination to the
Legislature, which I consented to do at
the request of George Hearst.
"The people should stop to think of
the Government they received from
1882 to 1891. The Democratic adminis
tration of public affairs then was the
best they ever had. The government
was run for $3,850,000 a year. To-day
it costs 16,000,000. What .has been the
cause of this? I will tell you. This
â¢Mud Mill.' It has quarreled and fought
with every reputable man who I is
come into politics that it could not us-.
"These attacks on me are personal,
not political. The present proprietor of
that paper came to me in the State
convention of 1890 and wanted me to
defeat the aspirations of the Hon. Ste
phen M. White, who was seeking the
indorsement of that convention for
United States Senator. This I refused
to do. He afterward, through an
agent, wanted me to secure for him a
franchise for the Electric Improvement
Company from the Board of Supervi
sors. His agent offered to sell me three
thousand shares of Electric Improve
ment Company stock at $2 a share,
stating that when the franchise was
granted it would be worth $75 a share.
I leave it to the public what I was to
do with this stock. I informed his
agent if he wanted to do business of
that kind he would have to do it him
self, as I was not engaged in it. So
you' can see, as I say, his persecution
of me is personal, not political."
In reply to questions s as to the ad
vancement of money to the Examiner,
Mr. Buckley said he got back the
money loaned. Speaking of Lawrence's
career in the Legislature, he said the
managing editor of the Examiner was
a nonentity. "But," he continued. "I
do know, according to the papers, that

CONVERTED YACHTS FOR
CENTRAL AMERICAN WATERS
The Dorothea, Frolic, Hawk and Viking Off Cape Charles.
According to a dispatch to The ("all from Washington, the Navy Department proposes to arm four yachts
which are to do service in Central American waters in case of emergency, with formidable batteries. The Do
rothea will be nicest heavily armed. She will be supplied with six 6-pounders and four Colt automatic machine
guns, a very heavy armament for such comparatively small craft. The Frolic will be supplied with four 6
pounders and two Colts. The Hawk will receive two 6-pounders and two Colts, and the Viking will probably
have a similar battery. All the vessels are light draught, ranging from eight and a half to twelve feet, and
they are- consequently able to get closer to shore than a regular man-of-war.

STREET DUEL WITH
WHIPS AS WEAPONS
Two Sturdy Men Lash One Another
for Ten Minutes at San
Anselmo.
SAN ANSELMO. July 24.â A duel of a
novel character occurred here yesterday,
in which two sturdy men stood for ten
minutes and lashed each other with
horsewhips, to the intense interest of a
large crowd that was waiting for a train.
Both men were painfully injured in the
contest, which was terminated only by
the horses of one of the combatants run
ning away.
John lago, who is foreman of a wood
choppers' camp at Camp Taylor, came to
San Anselmo to get a quantity of sup
plies expected on the next train. li*
tied his horses in front of the regular
hitching posts in such a way that the
large lumber wagon allowed room for no
body else's vehicle. When Eric Pereari,
the proprietor of a resort at Fairfax, ar
rived and demanded room in which to tie
bis team he was refused. Pereari struck
lago's horses with his whip to make them
move along and was- answered with a
blow from lago's whip. Leaping to the
ground, whip in hand, both men went at
it and for ten minutes rained blows upon
one another, lago had no coat on and
got the worst of the contest, but stuck
to his whip and lashed his opponent
across the back and head until some
women witnesses begged the men present
to interfere.
At this juncture lago's team took fright
and ran away. The owner desisted from
the fray and ran after them, with the
blood streaming from a cut across the
-cheek. Pereari had several welts across
the face.

Disliked by the Grand
Army Men.
Special Dispatch to The '-all.
CAPE HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 24.â
Efforts are being made to induce Presi
dent McKinley to forestall the formal re
quest from the Grand Army encampment
for the removal of H. Clay Evans, Com
missioner of Pensions, by transferring
him to some other field. It is an embar
rassing situation for the President, but,
unlike the conditions which brought about
Mr. Alger's retirement. Commissioner
Evans' removal is demanded because he
has too conscientiously performed his
duty.
A special commission appointed by the
Grand Army was recently in Washington
to investigate the doings of Mr. Evans
as commissioner and will report to the
Grand Army encampment which will
meet in Philadelphia In September. Five
members of this committee called upon
the commissioner and the President, and
after concluding their investigation of
the work of the Pension Office separated,
each agreeing to put his individual views
in writing by the time the committee
comes together in September.
During their conference with the Pres
ident, it is understood, they found much
fault with the obstacles they assert Com
missioner Evans was putting In the way
of old soldiers and their widows receiv
ing pensions. And. it is stated, It is Inti
mated that the President might save him
self considerable embarrassment by trans
ferring the commissioner to some other
post.
When these complaints against Mr.
Evans were first made the President paid
little attention to them, but he ls now
said to be wavering. In spite of the fact
that Commissioner Evans has been more
than 01 cc praised by the administration
for his administration of the Pension
Office, it would not be at all surprising.
in view of recent developments, if the
President yielded to the pressure now
being brought to bear on him and trans
ferred Mr. Evans to another office better
than or "equally as good" as the one he
holds.

tor and an officer. That was the last seen
of him for the night, and It was not until
11 o'clock that the terrible deed was re

ment, but the suspense of fearing the
loss of our positions is terrible." The
writers beg General Otis to Intercede for
their release, and he has taken steps in
that direction.
Two Augustinian friars who had landed
frcm the Hongkong ship have been ar
rested here. it Is said they had docu
ments upon their persons snowing they
were agents of the Filipino Junta at
Hongkong and that they intended to bear

BATTLE ON NEGROS
WASHINGTON, July 24.â The War
Department to-day made public the ca
blegram received yesterday from General
Otis, giving fuller details of the light, with
the robber band on the island of Negros.
Its text is us follows:
The campaign against the mountain rob
ber bands on Negros was more successful
than at first reported. Byrne with his
seventy men, killed one-third %C the 450
assembled. Including their leader, a Span
iard or Spanish Mostlzo. Pursuit was
then made by Lieutenant Evans and a
detachment of the Sixth Infantry, who
killed three and captured one of the rob
bers. They also captured many spears
and bolos and a large quantity of pro
visions and destroyed 100 huts. The two
casualties in Byrne's fight are Private

STRUVE WILL RECOVER.
WATSONVILLE, July 24.-Lawrence
Struve, who was shot by his uncle, Peter
Storm, on Saturday night, will soon re
cover from the -wound inflicted. It is not
thought the prosecution of Storm will be
pushed by the Struves, owing to the fact
that they do not wish their family
troubles aired In court. It is not thought
the failure to prosecute will lessen In any
way the 111-feeling that exists between
the male members of the several families.
DISAPPEARANCE
OF A SENATOR
Friends of Beveridge
Are Worried.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, July There has
been some concern here over the
present whereabouts of Senator Al
bert J. Beveridge. Letters last re
ceived from Nagasaki, Japan, dated
\ June 30, showed that he was quaran
tined on board Ship near there, with
the Asiatic plague on the vessel. One
of these letters, apparently smuggled
ashore, was from the Senator himself.
j He states that the victims on board
I were Chinese from Hongkong. In the
I letter the Senator says: "Thank heaven,
i Mrs. Beveridge is at Kioto."
i There has been no cablegram from
! him since the date of the letter. Mr.
j Beveridge has been over a great deal
| of china and traveled over 400 miles on
i horseback around Manila. He was with
i Lawton in his advance and was under i
Ore several times. Advices by mail say
the Senator had a close call in one en
gagement, four bullets being imbedded
in a tree against which he was stand-

ing. several within a few inches of his
head.
A. J. Beveridge, who was chosen to suc
ceed Senator Turpie in the United States
Senate, was born a poor boy. He did
chorea on a farm, then went to the city
and sold papers on the streets, then
studied law, and was admitted to the bar.
Everything he has won for himself by
his own. unaided efforts. This Is not to
say ne did not gain friends, who have
been of great help t.i him. His talents
drew men to him. In the Presidential
campaign of 1896 a Chicago millionaire
wanted to gel Mr. Beveridge out to Chi
cago to deliver a Republican speech a
the Auditorium. He. spoke to the Repub
lican committee about him, but the com
mittee, not knowing much about the Indi
ana man, declined to incur the expense.
The Chicago man, whose name is J. O.
Shaffer, agreed to pay the expense. Still
the committee hesitated, but Mr. Shaffer
said he- would also guarantee the quality
of the speech, So the engagement was
made. When Beveridge rose to speak he
was probably not half so anxious as his
Chicago friend, whoso political reputation
was at stake. Mr. Beveridge began slowly
and quietly, but before long his fine ora
ton began tee rouse the audience of 50W
men to enthusiasm. Time after time they
rose i nd cheered him, and his triumph
was complete. Then the committee was
anxious to take Mr. Shaffer's financial un
dertaking off his hands, but he was just
as anxious to keep it. One result of the
speech was thai when the Chlcagoans
went to the Omaha exposition to cele
brate Chicago day they sent for Bever
idge 10 go along and make their speech
for them, which he did with great suc
cess. Mr. Beveridge is a young man with
classic features, long dark hair and im
posing presence. He Is a brilliant lawyer
and a natural orator.

SAVERS HOPES TO
EXTRADITE KEETON
Filed a Statement Charging Him With
Stealing Sheep in Sutton
County.
AUSTIN, Tex., July 24.â Governor Say- j
ers has not yet abandoned hope of secur- j
ing the extradition of John Keeton, now
In jail at Juarex, Mexico, and wanted in |
Coleman County, Texas, to answer the j
charge of participating In the robbery of i
a Texas and Pacific passenger train and j
killing the fireman. In response to a i
request of the Mexican Government the !
Governor to-day forwarded to the United ;
States extradition agent at El Paso cer- j
, tified copies of judgments and sentences I
against Keeton's accomplices, together :
with a certified copy of the testimony of I
the State's witnesses as It appears ln the |
statement of facts used on appeal, which
facta connect Keeton with the crime. Sup
plementary to this evidence the Gover
nor to-day filed an additional application
for Keeton's extradition based on an mi
i dictment found against him in Sutton
i County for sheep-stealing.
The Mexican Government's refusal
I to grant the first application for Keeton's
extradition was on the ground that he is
charged In the application with being an
accomplice in Coleman County and that
the extradition treaty does not provide
for the extradition of persons charged i
with being accomplices in a crime.

There was great excitement when the

those ln the mine who might be dead.
It was several hours before the extent
of the disaster was known, as the mm!

GOLD FROM ATLIN.
First Shipment of Dust Out of the
New District.
SKAGUAY*, July 20, via Seattle. July 24.
One hundred and thirty thousand dollars
in gold dust came in on the evening train
from Atlin. The shipment was made by
the Atlin branch of the Merchants' Bank
of Halifax. Mr. Hotsford. traveling aud
itor of the bank, had with him an assort
ment of nuggets, the largest of which was
over sixteen ounces of pure gold.
Jesse F. Murphy, a well-known poli
tician of Olympia. Wash., brought out a
collection of handsome nuggets worth
$1000. The productive creeks as reported
in this shipment are Pine, Wright. Wil
low. Musket, Otter. McGee and Spruce.
Blankenship, on Wright, had the largest
individual success, and Willow has proved
rich beyond expectation. Dr. Runnells of
Puvallup is working twenty-five men on
this creek and taking out a very large
amount of- dust dally. Very rich quartz
has recently been struck on this creek
by Christopher of Portland.
Judge Irving is settling up disputed
claims as rapidly as possible, and in every
case is showing a preference for the orig
inal locator, generally an American. His
decisions give general satisfaction. Hun
dreds of claims are idle owing to dis
putes, and hundreds of others are idle be
cause the owners do not care to go on
them while the close season lasts. It is
believed, however, that the season will be
opened August 1. and that during the next
two months the output will be a great
surprise.
SUSPECTED OF MURDER.
Twiner Rescued From Death at Sea
Ends His Life.
JUNEAU, Alaska. July 18 (via Seattle,
July 24Â». Anton Baluh, an Austrian
miner, shot and killed himself to-day. His
suicide was the final act of an unusual
experience.
A few days ago Raluh was picked up at
sea ln an open boat off the mouth of
Copper River by the small steamer Dora.
His only provisions consisted of some
dried apples and a small quantity of fresh
water. In broken English he said he had
been struggling against the waves three
days. He and a companion named Bru

out from Sunrise City in an open boat.
A heavy sea swamped the boat, . and
Brunell was drowned. Some of the
passengers on the Dora intimated to Ba

and his constant brooding over this Is
thought to have caused his self-destruc

terious gases for balloon projectiles and
for the prohibition of the use of bullets
that easily expand in the human body.
The final act contains five expressions
of opinion, as follows:
The conference considers that limita
tions of the military charges which at
present oppress the world are greatly to
be desired for the increase of the material
and moral welfare of mankind.
The conference expresses the opinion
that the question of the rights and duties
of neutrals should be inscribed on the
programme of a conference to be held at
an early date.
The conference expresses the opinion
that the questions relative to the type and
caliber of rifles and naval artillery as
examined by it should be the subject of
study by the different Governments with
a view to arriving at a uniform solution
by a future conference.
The conference expresses the wish that
an early convention be called to revise
the Geneva convention.
The .conference had resolved that
questions relating to the inviolability
of private property in war on land and
the bombardment of towns or villages
in naval war be reserved for future
conferences.
The convention was signed by all the
plenary delegates.
WASHINGTON, July 24.â The United
States will not be bound by the reported
decision of The Hague conference to
prevent the use of the dumdum bullet
in warfare. So far we have not been
obliged to resort to the use of this bul
let, but the ordinance officers have been
making experiments to secure an in
creased "stopping" effect for the small
caliber ball used in the Krag-Jorgensen,
and these experiments have proceeded
somewhat on the lines of the dumdum
ball.
The specific reason why Captain Cro
zier and the remainder of the Ameri
can delegates voted against the pro
posal to prohibit the dumdum bullet
was because their general instructions
forbade them to pledge this Govern
ment to any line of action that would
retard the development of inventive
genius in war. Adhesion to the pro
tocols is voluntary. Great Britain also
refuses to prohibit the use of the dum
dum bullet.

v 731 MARKET ST., 8. F. HPRESIDENT KRUGER IS REPORTED TO
HAVE RESIGNED.
â¦ PAUL KRUGER OF THE TRANSVAAL. t
# Who is reported to have resigned the Presidency of the South African +
iblic.
(From his latest photograph, reproduced from Black and White.) .
PARIS, July 24.â Dispatches re
ceived here from Pretoria. South
African republic, say the absence
of President Kruger from the
â¢.. Â meeting of the executive council
to-day gave currency to* a report that
he had resigned, owing to differences
between himself and members of the
Volksraad.
President Kruger. when seen to
right in regard to the matter, denied
these rumors, stating positively that
they were without foundation.
PRETORIA, July 24.â President Kru
ger had been absent from the Govern
ment building since Friday afternoon
and It was understood that, owing to
the opposition shown by the executive
council and the Volksraad regarding
the questions of -the Johannesburg fort
and the dynamite monopoly, he had ar
rived at the conclusion that he no
longer possessed the Iksraad's con
fidence and threatened to resign. To
day, however, a deputation, including
General Joubert, the Vice President,
Herren Schalk and Burger and the
chairman of the Volksraad, waited upon
President Kruger and induced him to
attend a secret session of the Volks
raad, which lasted over three hours.
Meanwhile an anxious crowd had as
sembled outside the building, waiting
expectantly tec learn the outcome of
what was regarded as a momentous de
bate.
Late this evening it was announced
that the Volksraad had finally assured
the President that they had the utmost
confidence in him. It is understood,
however, that a majority of the mem
bers of the Volksraad still differ from
the President on the dynamite monop
oly question.
KRUGER'S CAREER AS
SOLDIER AND STATESMAN
The resignation of President Kruger
would end a long career of activity and
usefulness in the service of his country,
during which be has filled most accepta
bly every office from the highest to the
lowest in her gift. As soldier and diplo
mat he has been In continuous service
â¢since 1842 and has well earned the respect
of his foes and the love of his own peo
ple, to whom he was commonly known
as "Oom Paul" (our Paul).
Stephanus Johannes Paulus, as Kru
ger was christened, was born at Coles
burg, Cape Colony (since 1806 under Brit
ish rule.), in 1825, and is therefore about
75 years of age. His first African ances
SILLY LEGISLATION
THAT DID NO HARM
Seoator White Says th)e Anti-

_\ LOS ANGELES, July 24.â 1t is the opinion of Senator Stephen M. 9
â¢* White that the so-called newspaper signature and anti-cartoon bills en- .*
Â£ acted by the last Legislature will be dead letters so long as they are per- f>
JH mitted to remain upon the statute books of the State. Senator Whit' %
& was to-day asked what steps had been or would be taken by the news- %',

ft. these laws. He replied: â !:'â  S
Â£5 'There is nothing that can be done. Neither the newspapers nor any Â£â¢

i? of the biggest newspapers of the State have been waiting for months for if
6 an action to be brought against them for a violation of either of the Â£
â¢* two statutes you have named, but no one appears to be willing to come i*

tor was a German, and not a Holland
Dutchman, as has been often said.
Though he spelled his name as Paul
Krugsr, he signs it to-day Kruger (Kroo
ger) after the Dutch, and not Kr tiger
(Krueger) after the German form. As a
boy of 10 years of age he marched at his
father's side in the "Great Trek" of 1835
to Natal and later back over the Drak
ensberg Mountains to the Orange Free
State. He was called into public office at
a very early age, being made magistrate
under the title of "held cornet" when
only 17, and until his present retirement,
of his own volition, he has in one posi
tion or another ever since been continu
ously In the service of his country. When
but vet a mere lad he took part in tbe
war with the Matabeles nd earned much
distinction by his skill and coolness and
bravery.
As a young man of 2.1 he went into his
first fight with the British, and was with
his father when the latter tired the first
shot at the battle of B< omplatz, of which
latter fact he has always since made no
small boast.
Upon the annexation of the Orange re
public by the British Paul Kruger, with
a large number of his countrymen,
"trekked" again, crossed the Vaal River.
and with others who had gone before di
rect from Natal laid the foundation of the
"Transvaal." or South African Republic.
Having earned distinction as a brave sol
dier, and confidence as a cool and clear
headed man. he made- rapid advancement
ln the official positions of the primitive
republic, and by 1*59 had reached the of
fice of commandant. â¢ He held this -position
during the civil war of 1860, and by his
unwavering determination, quick action
and undaunted bravery, together with finÂ»
strategic skill, soon worsted his oppo
nents, captured Potchefstrom. their head
quarters and principal stronghold, and
brought the war to a close. Under the Pres
idency of Van Rensburg Kruger was madÂ»
commander-in-chief of all the Boer forces,
then engaged in hard struggle with the
Kaffirs, Zulus and other tribes, and in the ;
face of overwhelming numbers managed
affairs- most advantageously. In 1876 he
was elected Vice President, which office
he held when the annexation of the
Transvaal was proclaimed by Sir Theophi
lus Shepstone ln behalf of Great Britain
In 1877. He was the leader of the famous
triumvirate composed of Pretorius, Jou
bert and himself, which strenuously op
posed annexation and stood out for the
Independence of the Transvaal as guar
anteed in the Sand River convention of
1852. To Sir Bart I- Frere he appeared most
obdurate on this point always saying:
"We want our country back. We will
take nothing less than our country, and
we will not rest day or night until we
get it."
Kruger was a leading: spirit in the prep
arations for the revolt in 1880-81, and took
an active part in the direction of affairs
at the battle of Majuba Hill, where the
British were bo disastrously defeated and
made overtures for peace.
Kruger. of course, was a lender In the
reorganization of the Transvaal republic, j
and by his wise and moderate counsels
did much to heal the differences that had
been engendered by the events of the pre
vious five years. In 1883 he was elected to
the Presidency for five years. and ,-. -
elected in 1888, 1893 and again to his fourth
term in 1898,

WALLACE. Idaho. July 24.â Argument
in the Corcoran case began this morning.
J. H. Hawley opening for the State. No
limit will be placed on time, but either
side will I;-.- allowed only two speeches.
Robertson will follow Hawley, Reddy
closing for the defense and Borah for the
State.
Hawley occupied the morning session
with an argument on the law In Its appli
cation to Corcoran's case, and in the
afternoon spoke tor two hours, detailing
the evidence. Most of the time was taken
up with the evidence of conspiracy involv
ing the Coeur d'Alene miners and Cor
coran as an officer and leading spirit in
the Burke and Central unions. He de
clared the evidence show- i that all four
unions were moving in harmony, making
connections with each other, and dwelt
upon the orderly movements at Kellogg,
the firing line, the throwing out of skir
mishers, and the leaving of a reserve
party to bring powder when the mill was
captured. The strictures on the people in
Burke were severe, the evidence having
shown that disguises were unnecessary
there. He likened conditions here to the
days of the Molly Magulres in Pennsyl
vania, when strong alibis could be pro
cured for any one arrested. ; He took
twenty minutes to explain that the State
: was making no fight against labor organ
izations when conducted for lawful pur
j poses, believing that the right to organize
was the privilege of laboring men; but
â  that the State fought organizations like
those here which were only for criminal
purpose .
Robertson followed, speaking for an
hour before court adjourned, mainly on
the conditions here, where all mine oper
ators paid men the same scale of wages
except the Bunker Hill Company, and
showing that the latter not only paid less
wages but invited trouble with the unions
by discharging all union men from its
mines wherever found, and refusing to
arbitrate ln compliance with the State
law when the difficulty began in April.

RECIPROCITY
WITH FRANCE IS
FINALLY ARRANGED
Last Treaty Under the Dingley
Act and Marks the End of a
Long Discussion.
WASHINGTON, July 24.â The long pend
ing reciprocity treaty negotiations be
tween the United States and France were
brought to a successful close at the State
Department late this afternoon, when
Embassador Cambon, in behalf of France,
and Commissioner Kasson, in behalf of. the
United States, affixed their signatures to
the reciprocity treaty. It is by far the
most important treaty concluded under
the reciprocity provisions of the Dlngley
law. and tbe only one affecting the trade
with a large commercial nation. The ne
gotiations were marked by rather sharp
and long continued discussions, which
continued to the time the signatures were
placed on the document. In the end a
spirit of compromise prevailed and each
side yielded something. As a whole, both
sides express satisfaction with the gen
eral results secured, for while the com
promise necessitated some minor sacri
fices the general effect of the treaty will
encourage commerce between the two
countries.
The concessions granted by France em
braced most of the articles In what is
known as the French minimum tariff. This
comprises 644 heads, the rates being on an
average about 20 per cent lower than
those in the general tariff of France. It
was found necessary, however, owing to
protests from French agrarian interests
to except from this minimum list about
twenty-four articles, chiefly agricultural
products. The French Ministry was
obliged to pay heed to this sentiment, and
in turn M. i la-Boon made- the exceptions
a condition of closing the treaty. It was
on this point that the negotiations were in
doubt for several days, and it was only by
compromising on the extent of the excep
tions that an agreement was made [pos
sible As first presented the exceptions
numbered twelve, but some of these were
classes including -'a number of distinct
items so that In all there were a large

FINE CLOTHING ENTICED
THEM AWAY FROM HOME
Two Runaway San Francisco Girls
Found by the Police of
Stockton.
STOCKTON, July 24.â Through two
pictures in a newspaper the police were
yesterday able to locate two girls for
whom the officers of San Francisco have
been searching for weeks. Beatrice and
Jennie Jorgensen are two pretty girls,
who apparently were not satisfied be
cause they did not have as gay colored
dresses as other girls in the neighborhood.
They left their home one morning sev
eral weeks ago, and their mother, who i.:
a widow, has been using every means
to find them, but without avail.
The poll officers read of the disap
pearance of the girls in yesterday after
noon's papers.
Jennie, the elder of the two, who had
assumed the name of Madeline, was tound
at a house where she was engaged in
domestic duty. When the officers ac
costed her she admitted her identity and
burst Into tears. . â¢,
The girl, who is IS years of age. said
that she had left home to make some
money with which to buy good clothes.
She then proposed to save something and
become either a milliner or a stenog
rapher. Her sister wanted to learn .-short
hand. She could offer no explanation,
however, as to why she should leav - her
mother without a word of warning.
Chief of Police Gall sent Jennie home
yesterday afternoon. The other sister,
Beatrice, is very ill here, but will return
home as soon as she is well.
POPE AGAIN SUFFERING
FROM HIS OLD MALADY
The Attack Is Not Serious, but He
Has Been Advised to Take
a Rest.
NEW YORK, July 24.â A Journal cable
from Rome says: The Pope is again in
disposed. His old trouble, intestinal ca
tarrh, has reappeared.
The present attack is not serious, but at
the earnest request of Cardinal Lappon
the Pope has abandoned his Intention of
conducting the villeglature.
Ex-Judge Gregg Dead.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, July 24.â V. A.
Gregg, 'ex-Judge of the Superior Court
of this county, died suddenly from a lit
of appoplexy to-day.
important of these articles are petroleum
and mineral oils. At present these oils
enter France on the minimum rate, but
had to-day's treaty failed a rate would
have been imposed making a difference,
of duty amounting to about $5,000,000. The
same is true as to cotton, which is one
of the chief articles of shipment from the
United States to France and enters duty
free. Had the treaty failed a heavy duty
would have been imposed upon Ameri
can cotton. The same is true of copper,
rubber and many classes of machinery.
France secures important' concessions in
over 100 of the chief products sent by
France to this country.
The Dingley law allows not to exceed
20 per cent reduction as a basis of reci
procity, but the full 20 per cent is not
allowed on all the articles covered by the
treaty. On some of them the reduction
is 5 per cent, on others 10 per cent, others
15 and up to 20 per cent. The list would
have been larger and the percentage of
reduction greater In some cases had it
not been for the reluctance of Commis
sioner Kasson to permit exceptions from
the French minimum list. This was the
main cause leading to the omission of
champagne from the list of Important
French products included in the treaty.
While quite desirous of securing a re
duction of duty on this class of wines,
the French authorities were not ready to
grant the large number of reductions
asked as an offset for the proposed re
duction on this particular article. As a
result the regular rates will be main
tained on sparkling wines coming to this
country.
The treaty will result in placing the
products of the United States on the same
basis in France as nroducts of Germany
and Great Britain. At present these coun
tries have the minimum French rate,
while the American goods with few ex
ceptions have had to pay the maximum
rate.
The negotiations ended to-day were be
gun two years ago by M. Patenotre. then
Embassador from France. When he was
succeeded by M. Cambon the latter took
up the negotiations and for a time th.-sre
was a prospect of concluding a treaty,
but delays occurred, and in order to close
the matter the French authorities sent
from Paris M. Charpentier, a treaty ex
pert, as special reciprocity delegate.
Embassador Camhon will leave for
Paris In about a week, carrying with him
the French draft of the treaty. The
French treaty is the last of the instru
ments of this kind and the treaty work
under the Dingley act is now brought to
a close.
MRS. RICH TO BE
TRIED IN MEXICO
Extradition of an Amer
ican Woman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Tex., July 24.â Mrs. Mat
tie C. H. Rich, charged with having
murdered her husband, John D. Rich,
in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, two months
ago, was formally extradited this aft
ernoon at 4 o'clock and delivered into
the hands of the Mexican authorities
for trial. She protested strongly, but
became resigned when the extradition
warrant was read to her. She wrapped
her shoulders and head in an Ameri
can nag and entered the carriage with
the officers and was rapidly driven
across the river.
The case of Mrs. Rich has attracted
wide attention, particularly along the
border, where the citizens have pro
tested against the extradition of any
American citizen to Mexico. The fact
that in this case the citizen is a woman
has greatly intensified the objection to
the procedure.
John D. Rich was the son of a prom
inent banker of Dodge City, Kans., and
courted and married his wife in Chi
cago during the World's Fair. They
went to Ciudad Juarez, opposite this
city, six years ago and engaged in mer
chandizing, she supplying a large share
of the capital. They quarreled often
because, it is alleged, Mrs. Rich was
jealous. Two months ago she found
Rich talking with a notorious woman.
Mrs. Rich attacked and severely beat
the woman. Rich came home late, and
during the night was shot while lying
in bed. Mrs. Rich called for a doctor
and a carriage and had her husband
quickly conveyed to a hospital in this
city.
Rich died and left a statement say
ing the fatal bullet was fired from a
pistol in the hands of his wife. Mrs.
Rich did everything in her power to
aid in the recovery of her husband and
has protested throughout that she is
not the guilty one. She is soon to give
birth to a child.
The Mexican Government has been
touched to the quick by the comments
on its methods of dealing out justice
and its barbarous treatment of prison
el^- and has provided Mrs. Rich with
fine quarters and promises her a
speedy trial. President Diaz has or
dered special officials from the City of
Mexico to Ciudad Juarez to attend the
case. ''â¢*' ''""
YAQUIS DEFEATED BY

Engagement Fought by General
Torres' Force With the Rebel
Tribe of Sonora.
LOS ANGELES. July 24.â According to
advices to-night received by General Juan
Ybarri of Mexico, who is in this city, the
warlike Yaquis of Sonora are again on the
warpath. The tribe is reported to have
plundered many haciendas, but yesterday
it was defeated in an engagement with

Electric Railroad Managers Who
Bravely Walked Into a Howling
Mob Have Since Learned Flight
Would Have Meant Death.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLORADO SPRINGS, July 24.â 1n
referring to the recent attack on the
electric line by fanatical â  natives â¢ in
Seoul, Korea, E. E. Rlttenhouse of this
city, who was connected with the con
struction of this railroad, said to-day:
I have received several letters and
many photos from Seoul lately, and the
most interesting incident to Americans in
connection with this uprising has not
been told, although the press generally
is giving much space to this singular out
break. This is doubtless due to the mod
esty of the two men interested, through
whom most of the news of the riots
reached America. I refer to H. R. Bost-
Wick of San Francisco, manager of the
Seoul Electric Company, and H. Ray
mond Krumm of Columbus, chief of the
engineering department, who alone and
unarmed, by their coolness and good
American nerve, dispersed a howling mob
of 3000 to 4000 Orientals and saved their
own lives and the power-house and elec
trie plant.
At the time the child was run over the
streets were literally packed wltn ex
cited natives discussing the decision of
the astrologers and "Mutangs," that the
electric railway and power-house were the
real causes of the drought and the suf
fering among the poor. With the death
of the child the noisy excitement gave
way to wild, unrestrained fury and the
howling mass of white-clad humanity
fell upon the cars, destroyed and burned
some of them and drove off, with broken
heads, the Japanese employes. A large
section of the mob. estimated by Mr.
Bostwlck at between three and four thou
sand, appeared before the power-house,
filling the street and swarming like sheep
over the city wall and the great east
gate which adjoins the power-house. It
was at this point that the two Americans
appeared on the scene. I have read In
a New York paper that the two Ameri
cans had to run for their lives. I am sure
no such idea entered their heads. To run
would be to Invite pursuit, and their re
mains would have soon been dragged
through the street. At any rate, they did
not run. but started across the open to
ward the mob. The effect was instanta
neous. The sight of those two calm and
fearless white men walking briskly into
the very jaws of death, utterly ignoring
the rage and -wrath of thousands, paral
yzed them with astonishment and awed
them into silence.
Suddenly Bostwlck held up his hand and
commanded them to "chorigah' (disperse)
by order of the United States of 1 America.
He had hoped to impress them With a
show of authority and parley until their
ardor cooled down a little, but he was
hardly prepared for the stampede that
followed the uplifting of his hand. Clubs
and stones that were intended for these
two brave Americans were dropped and
the rioters simply climbed over each
other to get away.
Harry R. Bostwick is a son of Rev.
c Henry E. Bostwick, assistant pastor of
I Trinity Presbyterian Church, situated at
! the corner of Twenty-third and Capp
streets. His brother, Frank F. Bostwick.
is cashier of H. S. Crocker & Co., and
resides in Eastland, Marin County.
Harry Bostwick lived at the family resi
dence. 3505 Twenty-third street, until about
two years ago. when he was engaged by
the syndicate now building the Seoul elec
tric line as a civil engineer, that being
his profession, and later was advanced
to the responsible position of manager.
His father left this city last April to
visit him in Seoul, having obtained leave
of absence from his arduous ministerial
duties, which he had performed during a
1 long period. The father has been with
: his son for some time, and is expected to
j return soon.
Harry Bostwick was born in this city,
and was educated in Horace Mann School.
After finishing there he took a three
years' course in civil engineering and
went to Xew York, where he ' studied
under the ablest professors. He returned
to this city and has been eminently suc
cessful since then. He is 2S years of age,
and. believing that there were great pos
sibilities in the Orient, decided to estab
lish himself there.
BOY SAYS HE SAW
GEORGE SAXTON KILLED
Stood on the Porch and Witnessed
Mrs. George Fire the Shot,
Then Ran Away.
CHICAGO, July 24.â Evidence which
might have had an important effect on
the trial of Mrs. Anna George at Canton,
Ohio, for the murder of George D. Saxton,
brother-in-law of President McKinley,
last October, came to light to-day in the
juvenile court.
Russell Hogan, 15 years old. who was
brought before the court as Richard
McKnight, declared that he had witnessed
the shooting and had left home that night
through fear of being called as a witness
at the trial.
"I was standing right across Lincoln
avenue from Mrs. Alt house" a place and
saw Mr. Saxton on the porch and saw
Mrs. George shoot him. I was afraid they
might do something to me if I told what
I had seen, so I left home and have trav
eled all over the country since then." said
the boy, when assured by Judge Tuthill
that nothing would happen to him if he
told the truth. In response to further
questioning young Hogan said that his
father was R. M. Hogan. superintendent
of the Aultman Manufacturing Company
and well known In Canton.
Judge Tuthill directed that the case be
continued till July 26, and Instructed Pro
bation Officer Kelsey to communicate
with Mr. Hogan at Canton regarding the
boy who claims to be his son. The boy
Is bright-looking and told his story in an
unassuming manner. He was brought be
fore the court on a charge of disorderly
conduct.

who recently.disposed of his clothing store
and started East to avoid paying Mrs.
Emelie T. Spring, who recently obtained a
divorce from him, $200 a month alimony,
reckoned erroneously. By the decree in
the divorce suit filed to-day, all his prop
erty is subject to lien for unpaid alimony.
In case the alimony is not regularly paid
the property is to be sold and a receiver
is to be appointed to take charge of the
property and proceeds. The decree is
dated June 30.
About two weeks ago Spring disposed of
his Interest in his store to his brother-in
law. F. "W. Moore, for $SOOO. and deeded
his real property to his sister "for love
and affection," and that he "may be cared
for by her." These transfers will now be
void, because the decree was signed be
fore they were made. The decree com
pletely upsets the plans of Spring, and it
is expected now that the truant Council
man will return to fight the case.

When the little loved one is sick, when

' features pinched with pain and there are
great blue circles under its eyes, the mother
I hovers about the bedside, and with anxious
i eyes tries to read the meaning of every ex-

A woman may save herself almost all of
this worriment about her children if she
will. but take proper care of her womanly
health during the period of gestation. A
' child born of a mother who is thoroughly
'< healthy in a womanly way will almost
! unfailingly be healthy and robust. Dr.
: Pierces Favorite Prescription acts directly
on the delicate and important organs that
! bear the burdens of maternity. It makes
them well, strong and vigorous. It heals
all internal ulceration and inflammation.
It stops debilitating drains. It fits for
1 motherhood and insures a healthy child.
j Thousands of happy mothers have testified
! rd its merits. No honest dealer will urge
\ you to take an inferior substitute for the
I little added profit it may afford him.
"A lady told me that Dr. Pierces Favorite
; Prescription was good to take when with child."
writes Mrs. Annie Simpson, of No. 13 Chelms-
; ford Street. Lawrence, Mass. : " I was suffering
! terrible pains, aud was unable to get about the
; house without being in misery ._ I began taking
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription and the first
bottle greatly relieved me. I took three bottles
before my baby was born, at which time I suf-
fered very little. The baby has been healthy
: since birth, and is now three months old and
: weighs fifteen pounds. When ray older child
; was born I suffer^ terribly. I don't know how

CHYNESE LOTTERY
RUNS WIDE OPEN
f-\ OOD times have come again in
Chinatown. have come again In
Chinatown.
I T Lottery is played openly and
aboveboard in two prominent
offices and so .re are the promoters
of the game of safety from police
molestation that another company is
fitting up Its rooms and will soon
start operations with a $10,000 drawing
twice a day.
On St. Louis alley, six doors from
the corner of Jackson street, is a tall
building with heavily barred windows
and massive doors. This is the home
of the Fook Tai lottery, and so cer
tain is this company that it can vio
late the. law with impunity that its
doors are wide open and throngs of
Chinamen pass in and out, buying
tickets and watching the daily draw
ings. St. Louis alley is a narrow run
way which winds around from Jack
son to Dupont streetâ so narrow that
four people can scarcely walk abreast
through it. Go there between 9 and
10 o'clock in the evening and the
alley will be found bo crowded with
Chinamen that it is almost impossible
to force a passage way through. These
Chinamen are there for the purpose
of purchasing tickets to the drawing
which takes place at 10 o'clock. There
is no attempt to disguise the nature
of the place, and while white men are
barred by the man at the head of the
stairs 11 is not a difficult matter for a
white man to so disguise himself that
he will be admitted.
At 39 Washington alley, commonly
known as Fish alley, is the home of
Man Lee Dow Lottery Company. Here
also tickets are sold openly to any t
Chinaman who wishes to invest in the
seductive game. The crowds are not
--I great about the doors of Man Lee
Dow, for that company is in had odor
and Fook Tai is taking away most of
its customers. But Man Lee Dow,
like Fook Tai, feels safe from police
Interference and runs wide open and
has banished secrecy from its cate
gory of accomplishments.
There are other lotteries in China

TENNIS PLAYERS
AT DEL MONTE
Doubles Handicap to Be Held
Under Auspices of Lawn
Tennis Association.
Interest among tennis players is cen
tered in the doubles handicap tournament
which will be played at Del Monte on the
ISth md 19th of August. It Is some time
since a general handicap open doubles has
been arranged and this one is likely to
prove attractive for that reason. The
handicapping will be the most difficult
obstacle to overcome In order to secure
the success of the tournament.
The promoters of the tournament rely
upon the visitors at Del Monte to make
the affair a social success, as it will pre
cede the week of sport of the Steeple
chase Association. There Is no prettier
place for a tennis tournament than Del
Monte and it has ever been popular with
the tennis cracks.
The handicap doubles order of tourna
ment is not, as a rule, popular with the
first-class players, but the setting of this
tournament will more than compensate
them for their sacrifice. The three clubs
will be well representedâ Alameda, Oak
land and the California. Across the bay
the interest in the tournament la even
greater than on this side. The Alamedans
have evinced a strong desire to enter and
many of the- players have formed double
teams with a determination to begin prac
tice at once. Oakland will not be repre
sented by the Hardys, as a team. Sum
ner Hardy will, in all probability, be at
Santa Monica on tic- !Tth. as he intends
to play in the Southern California tour
nament. Sam I lard',- will probably enter
with one of the other Oaklanders in first
class ranks, George Whitney, the present
champion of the coast, will not play in
the tournament. He will be on hand, how
ever, to meet the best of the racket
wielders in exhibition singles. Robert N.
Whitney fa at present away on a camp
ing trip and he will not be found in the
lists.
The entries will be made up of the ris
ing younger players. They have taken
the tournament quite serious and have
become more or less enthusiastic over It.
The- championship doubles tournament
of September 9 will be the next event
after the Del Monte games. The Pacific
States Lawn Tennis Association has not
yet decided where the tournament shall
be held. Some are In favor of Del Monte,
while others want San Rafael. The ob
jection to Del Monte is the expense, but
those .who advocate holding the tourna
ment at the great seaside resort claim

still compelled to do business under
cover. Possibly they do not stand in
with the powers that be, as the
friends of Fook Tai and Man Lee Dow
claim these latter companies do. Pos
sibly Fook Tai and Man Lee Dow do
not have a "pull" with the police, but
it is a fact that every Chinaman in
town and many white men know that
the tickets are sold openly every day
and that the drawings are held in
public In the rooms at the places men
tioned. There is evidently either neg
ligence, ignorance or on the part
of the police.
The success of these two companies
in getting business matters so- well
fixed has caused other astute China
man to think that competition will be
the life of trade, and almost directly
across the alley from the Fook Tal
Company's office the Chon Chun Wing
Company is lifting up offices and will
start a $10,030 drawing twice a day In
the near future. This company claims
that It will run openly and will not
be molested by the police. Whether
its boast will be made good or not
is for the police to say.
that they can secure reductions that will
place attendance within reach of all.
The championship doubles this year
promises to be a great event as far as
tennis itself is concerned. It Is likely the
Whitneys will double up once more, and
if they do the Hardys will also [day to
gether. This alone will make as great a
success of the' tournament as the playing
of the Hardys and George Whitney did
for the championship singles at San Ra
fael early in this month.

Tailors' Association Banqueted for
Their Splendid Pageant on July 4.
A banquet was given last night by the
Six Chinese Companies to the Chinese Tai
lors' Association, in recognition of the
splendid features the latter association
produced In the Fourth of July parade in

Chanty. '; >
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 24.â The
grand circuit races began to-day under
favorable weather and track conditions,
but the attendance was somewhat dis
appointing, owing, In the main, to the
street railroad strike. Only two of the
four races were finished, one being post
poned entirely and the other going over
unfinished. The race of most interest was
the 2:14 trot. Altoka was a hot favorite
before the race began, but he got only
one heat, and after hot finishes between
Charley Herr, Bonna T^lla and Altoka,
Chanty finally landed the rape.
Maximilian, the favorite, would have
won the 2:16 pace with ease in the first
three heats but for an accident to his
sulky in the first heat. The heat was
finished on one wheel, and McCarty was
thrown at the wire, but no other damage
was done. It took the favorite until the
fourth heat to recover himself, and then
he went out, winning as he pleased.
The 2:27 pace was the most disappoint
ing of all fur the talent. Harry O was
picked as a sure winner and was played
vigorously at any price. Sphynx S 'â __*
too speedy however, and he won the two
heats, finished after exciting contests with
Harry O in the first and Orin B in the
second.
The 2:19 trot went over until to-morrow.

SUICIDE OF A SCION
OF AN OLD FAMILY
HIS GRANDFATHER NAMED THE
TOWN OF MARTINEZ.
Had Been Drunk All His Life and
Wound It Up With a Revolver
Bullet at the Age of
Thirty-Six.
Joseph Martinez, a descendant of the
Contra Costa pioneer family of that name,
committed suicide yesterday by shooting
himself through the head. He was .36
years old and was born in the town of
Martinez, which took its name from the
grandfather of the suicide.
Joseph was a ship-painter by occupation
whenever he was sufficiently sober to
work It was his boast that he had been
drunk all his life. He and his brother,
Jose I. Martinez, had been on a spree last
Sunday night and took to their room
in a lodging-house at 1050 Howard street
two flasks of whisky. They arose at 8
o'clock yesterday morning and had sev
eral drinks of whisky by way of appetiz
ers and the subject of their- conversation
was what they believed, to be their bad
luck in not possessing more of the world s
S Â°Flnany Joseph pulled out a drawer of
the bureau and took therefrom a British
bulldog revolver of 44 caliber. He began
revolving the cylinder and Jose cautioned
him about being careless, whereupon^ Jo
seph laughed and with the remark I m
tired of fife, anyhow," placed the muzzle

Tivoli.
The people of this city know a good
thing when they see it. and this is the
reason why the Tivoli Opera-house was
rrowded to the doors last evening. The
good thing was J. C. Goodwin's comic
jperetta, "Wang." Two years ago this
piece was presented at the Tlvoll and ,

nit here. Coincident is the fact that he
Digs good-by to his many admirers, prior j
' ;o his departure to the East, in his ongl- j
nal character of Wang, regent of Siam.
He was at his best In acting and voice.
The old nursery songs of the piece were
particularly catching and the juvenile
quartet came in for a large share of well
merited applause. Ada Palmer-Walker,
in the character of Mataya, the crown
prince, was well received. It was a sur
prise to all that she was able to carry
the character so well where heretofore
she has appeared only In prima donna
roles. Charlotte Bockwith, Georgie Cooper
and Inez Dean, and in fact the entire
company, appeared at its host and there
is no doubt that "Wang" will draw full
bouses. Next week the Tlvoli's grand
opera season will open.

California.
Blanche Bates as Mme. Sans Gene is
pre-eminently a success. "Madame Sans

California is likewise. The theater was
crowded last evening with those who had
come to see one of the best nights the
Frawlevs have furnished since their ar
rival in town and Blanche Bates in her
marvelous variety. Â
The difficulties of the play were well
calculated to bring out with a good deal or
force the strength of the peoplewitb whom
Mr. Frawlev has come West. Augustus
Cook as Emperor Napoleon. Charles W.
King as Fouche and Miss Bates In the
title role were honored with repeated cur
lain calls after each act.
Mr Cook's Interpretation of the char
acter of the Emperor has put him much
in the favor of the first-nighters if the
considerable comment that followed the
last act goes for anything. It is a part
which he originated and to which he is
peculiarly adapted. Mr. Frawley as De
Neipperg was simply Mr. Frawley, and
for a week is relegated to a part that
does not lead him often to the footlights.

Grand Opera-House.
The production of Gounod's opera of
"Faust" at the Grand Opera-house last
night was a genuine success and it should
prove the hit of the season. It was mag

rendered and the orchestra was admira

The finale, showing Mephisto and Faust

Preliminary Examination of the Phy
sician Accused of Murdering His
Patient. John Kehlenbeck, by
Overdose of Morphine.
Dr. C. C. J. Wachendorf, accused by a
Coroner's jury of causing the death of
John Kehlenbeck by a deliberate over
dose of morphine administered June 26,
appeared for preliminary examination be
fore Judge Treadwell yesterday after
noon. He was represented by Attorneys
Reel B. Terry and H. J. Custer. L. G.
Carpenter conducted the campaign of the
prosecution. The courtroom was crowd
ed. The defendant, according to the
statement of one of his attorneys, had
been given an injection of cocaine to
steady his nerves for the first legal fray,
and he was a study as he sat next to
| his legal advisers during the preliminary
' hearing. He listened with a smiling In
terest to the testimony of people he had
known during his short stay ln Alameda
! who stated that he had acknowledged
himself broke and starving while in that
city, and while the physicians called by
the prosecution were on the stand he
leaned forward and followed their techni
cal statements as to the relative effects
; of various poisons on the stomach with a
keen and painful concern.
It seemed to be the idea of the defense
to suggest that Kehlenbeck had died of
! a number of natural diseasesâ among
i them diabetes, pyloric tumor of the sto
mach and valvular affection of the heart;
' but the trend of the testimony advanced
lev the professional persons who took part
: in the autopsy and stomach analysis was
that the stomach of the deceased showed
every evidence of an overdose- of mor
phine not hypodermically Injected, but de
liberately taken into the stomach.
Deputy Coroner George F. Fisher, J. S.
Zabala, M. D., George F. Weeks, editor
of the Enclnal of Alameda; Dr. C. H.
Bronson of Alameda (who knew the de
fendant when he sojourned in the Enclnal
city). Deputy Coroner John D. Sullivan,
Dr. George F. Hanson and Dr. L. H. Gru
nig (who attended the autopsy and analy
sis of the stomach of Kehlenbeck), to
gether with City Chemist Louis Crackbon
were called during the afternoon.
Their evidence, in regular order, was
a succession of statements about the case
already published at the time the Coroner
took charge of the remains of the de
ceased. There was, however, quite a bat
tle from time to time between witness
and the attorney for the defense over the
matter of how the analysis could arbi
trarily determine that the deceased had
died from an overdose of morphine.
Dr Zabala. who examined the vital or
gans of Kehlenbeck. testified that the ex
cessive use of morphine was evidenced by
the analysis, although the stomach was
diseased and had in It a pyloric tumor.
Th- deceased had undoubtedly been a
constant user of morphine.
Dr. Bronson of Alameda had met the
defendant in Alameda. Wachendorf was
thou poor, had no money and confessed
himself a victim to the cocaine habit.
Dr Bronson, despairing of inducing him
to give up this habit, forbade him to visit
hi-* house. Keel B. Terry objected to all
this testimony, but the Prosecuting At
torney kept the ball rolling by stating to
the Judge that the plan of the prosecution
was to show that the defendant, after a
siege of poverty in Alameda, suddenly
grew rich lust before the death of his pa
tient and friend, Kehlenbeck. It was also
Intended to prove that Wachendorf was
accustomed to the use of cocaine and
morphine and had a sympathy of habit
with the deceased. ,
Deputy Coroner Sullivan testified that
he secured the body of the deceased on
the evening of June 26 of this year, at
Sire 1 -. Jessie street, up stairs. Wachendorf
was present at the time and gave the
witness several causes of deathâ said atro
pine had been administered to the de
c ceased to stimulate heart action, and
i stated that Dr. Kehlen had attended Keh
. lenbeck part of the time.
I Chemist Crackbon described the analysis
i made of the stomach to determine the
cause of death. Four tests were used. It
, appeared that morphine in large quanti
ties had been administered. There seemed
to be strong evidence of poisoning. Dr.
Hanson followed with technical descrip
tions of the various tests and chemical
results of the analysis made, all of which
has been published before.
Then Dr. Grunlg, who followed the tests
of the stomach of the deceased, came to
'< the stand. A lively word play followed
j between the attorney for the prosecution,
I the defense, the witness and the Judge.
I It was over the question of the presence
j of ptomaine In the stomach of Kehlen
beck. This germ poison is caused by the
'â  decay of animal matter, and the means
chemically used to detect it produce simi
lar results to those following an analysis
for evidences of morphine poisoning.
I Judge Treadwell listened patiently to the
1 ensuing volume of technical queries over
this matter, and finally asked Dr. Grunlg
! for some plain information as to
! ptomaines, and especially Invited statis
j tics as to the number of ptomaines which
the human stomach could accommodate
at one time. The witness went on to state
that there were several kinds of pto
maines, and among them one called the
"skate." This information, given in all
earnestness, caused a mild humor to per
meate the courtroom and precipitated an
adjournment until this afternoon at 2
o'clock. - - ': tf :
The prosecution has several witnesses
to call, and the subsequent attitude of the
defense is yet to be learned.
Meanwhile Wachendorf is closely jailed,
but manages to occasionally secure
enough cocaine and morphine to brace
his nerves for the trials yet to come.
THE TRANSPORT TARTAR SAILS.
General Joseph Wheeler and His
Daughter Were Among the

The transport Tartar got away for the

of the Fourth Cavalry went out on the j

before sailing. A number of the soldiers
had broken out and were having a fare
well drink when the corporal's guard
broke in on their revelry. They were all
hustled aboard the ship, and when they
showed fight were put in the guardroom.
Major General Wheeler and his daugh

number of people were down to see the
gallant Southerner away and he and his
daughter had quite a levee on the poop
deck prior to the gangway being hauled

TREADWELL IS SURE
HE HAS BEEN FOOLED
THE JUDGE ON THE "BRICK" Mc-
PHERSON WARRANT.
Thinks Some One Has Been Guilty of
Perjury or Contempt of Court in
Securing the Warrant.
Th? extraordinary circumstance of
"Brick" McPberson swearing out a war
rant for the arrest of Thomas R. Davis,
supposed to be a mythical personage, on
the charge of embezzling $100,000 has
aroused the indignation of Judge Tread
well, and ho is determined to probe the
matter to the bottom, as he thinks he
has boon made a fool of.
Yesterday afternoon he expressed his J
feelings from the bench. He said: "Mr. j
Clerk, I want you to put the case of
Thomas R. Davis, for whose arrest on a j
charge of felony embezzlement a warrant
was issued by this court last week, on the
calendar for Thursday and issue- subpenas j
to Attorney Harvey Brown. A. W. Mc
pherson and Prosecuting Attorney Car
penter to appear in court on thai day to
give fuller evidence to show why the court
should not withdraw the. warrant entirely.
"I also want the Chief of Police In
structed to bring the warrant into court,
and if it is not in the custody of the Chief,
whoever has it must hand it to the clerk
of the court.
"If the facts as represented in the news
papers are true, and I believe they are,
then the men Instrumental in issuing the '
warrant are responsible and should be -
punished. They are either guilty of per-!
jury or contempt of court. Everything
must be done to bring cent the facts, and
I am determined to do it.
"I don't believe that Mcpherson was
embezzled out of 1100,000., or even 50 cents,
and I believe he has committed perjury in
swearing to the complaint. The sooner
he is landed in San Quentin, where he
belongs, the better."
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter said it
was unnecessary to subpena him. as he
was an officer of the court. He knew a
man who was familiar with all the facts
and if the Judge would issue a "John
Doe" subpena, as he did not wish to give
bis name, he would see that It was served
upon him.
The Judge so ordered, and remarked
that he was satisfied the prosecuting at- ,
torney had only done his duty, but he
wanted the matter fully investigated.

he appeared before the Legislature as
a lobbyist to settle a claim of Himmel
man. It was nothing more than an at
tempt on his part of saddling a debt
on this city of $6,000,000. That fact was
published and spread broadcast over
the country. Lawrence is in the habit
of railing people unconvicted of crimes
criminals. This fellow has been con
victed and was sent to jail by the Leg
islature, and if he had his just dues
he would be there for the balance of
his life. I handed the nomination to
him at the earnest request of George
Hearst, but he never showed any grat
itude. My coat's off and I am ready
to fight. The more they come the
harder I will come back. I am not
seeking this notoriety. It is a cow
ardly attack on a man with his hands
tied or otherwise it would be different,
both to that scoundrel and the man
who has given me that tirade to-day.
I don't think the Lawrence-Rainey
crowd have any support outside the

DEMOCRATS OBJECT.
Twenty-Ninth District Club De
nounces the Examiner.
The Democratic club of the Twenty
ninth Assembly District held a meeting
I last night for the purpose of selecting del
egates to the next municipal convention,
to- be voted for under the new primary
: law. James B. McSheehy presided and
James J. Farrel was secretary. Four hun
dred of the 700 members of the club were
present. , .. .
James Bowlln created quite a stir and
much applause in an attack on the Exam
iner, which paper he accused of an at
tempt to destroy the Democratic party.
He concluded by saying that every Demo
crat should repudiate the Examiner. Re
marks of a similar tenor were made by
Thomas J. Eagan and others.
The club, after indorsing James D. Phe
lan and Dr. Washington Dodge, nominated
the following as its choice for delegates
to the coming municipal convention:
At largeâ Thomas J. Lagan.
First Precinctâ T. J. Malone, George

POLLIES GIVE FAY
THE HORSE LAUGH
General dissatisfaction has been caused
in the Democratic ranks by an attempt
on the part of Charlie Fay, acting pre
sumably for his Honor the Mayor, to in
duce the leaders of the different clubs
throughout the city to submit to him a
list of the names of the delegates whom
they intend nominating for the coining
primary election.
A roar has gone forth throughout the
different precinct clubs in nearly every
district, and it is safe to say that few
clubs have complied with Fay s re
quest. Â_. .
Several prominent politicians were sent
for by Fay and he informed them thai.it
was the wish of the Mayor to peruse the
names of the candidates and advise with
them as to the candidates best fitted to
serve the interests of the party and inci
dentally his own. .
In most cases the request was met with
a flat refusal, but there were some who
complied with the Mayor's wishes and
Mr. Fay's request. The matter has caused
considerable hubbub in political circles,
and Fay Is being severely criticised.
Whether or not the leaders of the clubs
will ultimately deliver themselves over
to Fay is a matter for conjecture, but
it is certain that the request has caused
some soreness and many laughs at the
expense of Fay.
Alcazar.
"Faust," with Lewis Morrison in the
role of Mephisto and Miss Florence Rob
erts as Marguerite, was the attraction at
the Alcazar last night. It was a gratifying
success. As the evil one Mr. Morrison
was afforded an opportunity for the full
display of his dramatic ability, and he
was rewarded by several curtain calls.
Miss Roberts makes a worthy Mar
guerite, and in the scene with her soldier
brother, who is dying from a sword thrust
Inflicted by Faust, and in the prison scene
sin played the pari with great pathos and
dramatic effort. White Whittlesey as 1
Faust is very good and Frank Denithorne I
made a very' favorable impression as Val
entine, Marguerite's brother. The play is
well staged and the scene on the summit
of the Hi-co-ken is given with startling
dramatic effect. Altogether, "Faust.'' as
put on by the Alcazar Company, is well
worth seeing, and Lewis Morrison's fare
well week bids fair to be his most suc
cessful of the season.
The Chutes.
Violet Pale bucked and winged her way
into the good graces of a large audience
at the Chutes theater last night. She
was heartily applauded, as were also Hal
let and Carroll, a clever comedy sketch
team. The three Kei tons provided a varied
entertainment, which ranged from toe
dancing and violin solos to _ complete
dog show. Blanche Le Claire Sloan, a
sister of the redoubtable Tod. gave a pret
ty Roman ring act, and Vifanta presented
a novel electrical club-swinging exhibi
tion. The rest of the bill was good. On
Thursday night a feature of the amateur
performance will he a fat ladies' bicycle
race.
DIAZ TO MAKE A TOUR
OF THE UNITED STATES
Mexico's President Will Accept Many
of the Cordial Invitations
Tendered Him.
CITY OF MEXICO, July 24.â President
Porflrio Diaz feels highly honored by the
; pressing invitations he has received to
! visit many of the principal cities of the
' United States during the coming fall.
While he has not accepted any of these
! invitations, it is stated on the authority
i of a member of his Cabinet that he will
probably obtain leave to go out of the re
public from Congress when that body
â  meets in September, and that he will start
on an extended tour of the United Stater*
about October 1. It has long been Presi
dent Diaz's cl, sire to make a trip such as is
now proposed, and he believes that no
' more propitious time for doing it will be
found than this fall.
NICARAGUA ASKED TO
REFUND TO AMERICANS
During the Recent Revolution Mer
chants Were Forced to Pay-
Double Port Charges.
WASHINGTON, July 24.â Secretary Hay
has called upon the Nicaraguan Govern
ment to refund to American merchants
â  the amount which they were illegally
compelled to pay for port and other duties
during the recent revolution at Bluefields.
Several American merchants were made
to pay these duties twice because officers
representing the revolutionists and the
I Nicaraguan Government were in control
of the different ports at the same time.
, A temporary adjustment was effected by
' the merchants ~aylng the second tax un
i der protest, with the understanding with
I this Government that their rights would
be protected and any overcharge refunded
when Nicaraguan politics assumed a
more satisfactory condition.

ing men of Boston and New York. Henry
Sellers and the two Fleming brothers of
Williams, attempted to cross the river,
which is full of rapids, whirlpools and
falls, at Bright Angel trail on July 9 in
a frail canvas boat. The boat capsized.
When last seen the capsized boat was
going over the rapids, Russell clinging
to it.
A search party was organised in the
hope that Russell reached shore some .'is
tance down the canyon, where, unac
quainted with the few trails leading out
of the canyon, he would perish from star
vation and exposure. The party consisted
of men who have many years' experience
in the great chasm. two of whom went
over the rapids and whirlpools in boats,
nearly meeting Russell's fate. There Is
little doubt now that Russell never
reached shore.

TWO CLASSES OF CITIZENS
DO you care for good government in San Fran
cisco? To that question every business man,
every property owner and every taxpayer will
promptly respond: "Of course 1 do." So far all are
agreed, but beyond that point differences appear, and
the general body of citizens divides into two classes.
The one class seeks to assure good government by
taking an interest in politics during municipal cam
paigns, the other class neglects every duty and shirks
ever*,' -responsibility of that kind, but when the cam
paign is over proceeds to manifest a great concern
for the public welfare by complaining, protesting and
denouncing everything that goes wrong and every
body connected with it.
In the terse language of the streets members of one
class are called "workers," and those of the other
are called "kickers." In communities where workers
prevail there is always a fairly honest and efficient
administration of public affairs, but where the kick
ers predominate there is endless corruption, jobbery,
confusion and wrangling.
There are too many of the kicker class in San Fran
cisco. Too many men of good position in the busi
ness world and in social and club life who content
themselves with wordy and windy denunciations of
bad politics, instead of making any serious and earn
est effort to remedy the evil and bring about the elec
tion of trustworthy officials.
These men find it easier and pleasanter to neglect
their political duties than to attend to them. They
have always some excuse. There is work to do in the
office or the shop, there is an engagement at the club
or the theater, there is a book to read, a friend to see,
or perhaps a mere inclination for dawdling, or play
ing pedro. Anything will serve to turn them aside
from the ward meetings, the primaries, the work ot
the canvass, or any other duty to which the responsi
bilities of citizenship call them.
The kickers become indifferent to politics as soon as an
election approaches. They may have been vehement
all through the year, but as soon as the time comes
when work is expected of them they lose interest in
the city. When urged to arouse themselves they grow
positively antagonistic. They not infrequently refuse
even to read anything about politics. They delight
in jibing at good men who show zeal in public affairs.
They stay in their places of business when no work
requires them, they hang around the clubs or their
homes for hours in idleness, and sometimes can be
heard boasting they arc "too respectable" to take
part in political campaigns.
Having neglected to attend to politics when by
attention they might bring about the election of good
men to office, they find very soon that they neglected
their own interests when they evaded their duty to
the community. Bad politics makes itself felt in their
business, in their homes, in the schools their children
attend, in the streets along which they pass and in the
taxes levied upon their property Then they arouse
again and for another year fill the city with the noise
of their complainings.
Every business man, property owner and taxpayer
cares for good government in San Francisco. The
issue before each of them to determine now is
whether they will manifest that care as a worker or
as a kicker. There is a chance to elect a good admin
istration to inaugurate the municipal government
under the new charter. The Republican party has
prepared the way. If the good citizens of San Fran
cisco share the political work imposed by the respon
sibilities of our republican institutions we can have as
good government as any in the world. If they prefer
private business or pedro games to politics they will
have none but themselves to blame if municipal
affairs pass under the control of Buckley or of Rainey
and the Examiner.
News comes that the report of the arbitration com
mittee has been adopted as a whole by the Interna
tional Peace Congress. Now will the congress ad
journ and crawl into it!
Canadians seem to have short memories. Sir Wil
frid Laurier says the only alternatives in the Alaska
boundary dispute are war or arbitration. He forgets
the Fenians.
The business man who neglects politics in this cam
paign will be neglecting business of the most import
ant kind
ROBERT G. INGERSOLL.
I F the reputation of Robert G. Ingersoll depended
IF the his atheism or his agnosticism it would be
upon his atheism or his agnosticism it would be
1 ephemeral. If the theories he so ostentatiously
announced were true there would be no excuse even
for reference to his extinguished existence. The
Preacher says: "And how dieth the wise man? As
the fool! Wherefore," he added, "I praise the dead
which are already dead more than the living which
are yet alive."
But Robert G. Ingersoll was not a great atheist,
nor a great agnostic. Dissimilar though they are, he
aspired in his published lectures and addresses to both
distinctions. His irreverence, however, his theory
of deistical brutality, was a mere phantasy, unsus
tained by scholarship or by reason and contradicted
by every element of his personal character. His love
for his wife and for his children, his tenderness to
ward relatives and friends, would have been spurious
and repulsive if in his heart he had not accepted what
in speech he derided and contemned.
Mr. Ingersoll was not a great lawyer. He was a
fine advocate before juries. He was an effective plat
form orator. He was capable of grasping immediate
situations and exciting the emotions of men and of
women. Upon occasions he would beat thin senti
mentalism into a glittering leaf that violated Shake
speare's injunction against painting the lily or adorn
ing the rose. And yet the man was intensely emo
tional and shocked human sensibility in terms that
mocked the iconoclasm he professed.
It was fashionable years ago for the narrow-headed
worshipers of themselves who infest modern com
munities to parade as gems sentences from Ingersoll
that, when they were analyzed, were meaningless.
The nineteenth century has produced great agnostics.
Strauss, the German, and Renan the Frenchman, were
specimens of this particular cult. But Robert G. In
gersoll belonged to a lower range of scholarship and
of thought. He had never studied the great German
and French critics of the Bible. His "mistakes of
-Moses" were pervaded by misapprehensions of the
text of the Pentateuch. When he attempted debates
with Jeremiah Black of Pennsylvania and with Wil
liam Ewart Gladstone, his propositions were liter
ally pounded into dust. His logic and his literature
completely failed when subjected to those tests that
represented the highest intellect and profctundest
knowledge of the world.
And yet. though not a great man. Robert G. In
gersoll was not common. The injury his avowed
sentiments might have done to the youth of the
country was counterbalanced by the clashing ac
knowledgments of his life. It was idle for a man to
deny the existence of God who confessed and pro
claimed the principle of fraternity. The aridities of
atheism were divested of their corrosive power when
pervaded by the magnetic affections. The brutali
ties of chance were idle assumptions when accom
panied by the admission of the certainties of law. The
hard conception of annihilation had no place in sen
tences that were infused with the glow and with the
heal of immortality.
There is some of the work of Ingersoll that will
survive and refute his atheistical and his agnostic pre
tensions. He delivered some addresses that were re
plete with tenderness and gently touched the finer
issues of life. He made some arguments that mani
fested power and energy. On many occasions he
developed a deep capacity for humor which was at
once broad and delicate. His heart and his intellect
frequently collided, and those sentiments that are the

The prevailing view of Ingersoll will sound in char
ity. He was better than his opinions, some of which
arrayed against him personal bitterness and held him
below the political crowns and rewards that he would
otherwise have reached. With all his peculiarities, he
stood for lofty principles and in many respects was
helpful to men and to women of all races. His voice
rang out for freedom and against every form of wrong
and injustice that illustrated the inequalities of civil
ization. He will be remembered in America and not
forgotten throughout the world.
THE ALASKAN BOUNDARY DISPUTE.
WHILE American and British banqueters are
holding festal Anglo-Saxon reunions in New
York and London, and while the delegates
from this country and those from Great Britain at the
Peace Conference are fraternally supporting one
another in advocating international arbitration as a
means of settling disputes between civilized nations
and the use of the dumdum bullet when arbitration
fails, the Governments of the two nations are having
the hardest kind of a time in determining which shall
have possession of a strip of territory and a harbor
in the remote wilds of the Alaskan coast.
The issue at stake is not large when the magnitude
of the territorial possessions of the two nations are
taken into consideration. Either of them could af
ford to lose the strip and would never miss it. The
soil in dispute will never be cultivated by either
Americans or British, and the trade of the harbor
will never yield customs duties enough to pay for
maintaining a warship to protect it. Nevertheless, the
dispute concerning the location of the boundary along
that frozen coast line has caused friction enough to
warm it up, and threatens to become in the end hot
enough to make it tropical.
The chief issue involved is the principle of the
thing. In the judgment of our diplomatists Pyramid
harbor belongs to us, and Canada is guilty of aggres
sion when' she demands it. In the judgment of the
Canadians the harbor belongs to them, and we arc
domineering land grabbers because we have taken
possession of it. Great Britain, it is said, is perfectly
willing to concede our claims, but docs not like to
irritate the Canadians. All parties are willing to ar
bitrate, but cannot agree on the terms of arbitration.
So while the champagne sparkles in the glasses of the
fraternizing sentimentalists in New York and London
the hardy adventurers who have gone to hunt gold in
the frozen north are getting their guns and making
ready to fight.
The genial diplomatists of a bygone age who drew
up over their walnuts and their wine the treaty be
tween Great Britain and Russia defining the boun
daries of their possessions in the great frozen north
west, without taking the trouble to have the country
surveyed or even explored, doubtless thought all was
well enough so long as it suited them. They did not
foresee that a time would come when the Russian
possessions would pass into our hands, when gold
would be discovered in the valley of the Yukon, when
there would be a sudden rush of trade into every har
bor along the Lynn Canal, when their carelessness
would come to disturb the relations of two Govern
ments whose people were bubbling over with the rap
ture of a fresh affection.
Such, however, is what has come to pass. The
Russians, who are desirous of keeping Great Britain
and the United States more or less hostile to one
another, are doubtless enjoying the situation. In
their judgment the blunder of the old treaty-makers
was providential. Of course there will be no war on

AUTOMOBILES AND RAILWAYS.
ANEW phase of the automobile question has
presented itself to Wall street. The far-seeing
speculators have begun to consider what effect
the new vehicle may have upon the earning capacity
of railways. It is not expected the competition will
be felt by long-distance freights, but it is believed the
short lines and the short-distance traffic over long
lines will be very seriously affected by the facilities for
transportation furnished by the motor cars.
A recent number of the Financial Review, issued
by Henry Clews & Co., in discussing the prospects of
railway earnings, says the problems of the trunk lines
may be solved by better management and by combi
nations, and then adds:
"The smaller lines, the feeders of the trunk roads,
would present a different problem, less easily con
ti oiled, and which, viewed in the distance, seems to
suggest a less promising outcome. It remains to be
seen how far that class of roads may be exposed to
competition from automobile carriage. Sufficient has
been already achieved by this new appliance to place
it beyond question that the automobile is destined to
become much more than a mere passenger vehicle.
With further perfecting in some of its minor details
it can be made available for carrying freight in con
siderable bulk, upon well constructed highroads, with
greater speed and at much less cost than by either
horse power or railroad. It thus becomes a question
of great interest whether much of the short-haul busi
ness of the railroads is not liable to be diverted from
the minor railroads to this new means of transport.
It is also a question under consideration among en
gineers whether it may not, in many cases, be found
possible to combine the automobile system with the
trolley system with advantage to both."
The Wall street men are by no means premature in
considering the problem. The competition, if it is to
come at all, will come soon in every section of the
country where there are good roads. The construc
tion of automobiles is being carried forward with all
the energy for which American manufacturers are
noted.
Not only are the manufacturing plants already en
gaged in making automobiles large and well
equipped, but new plants are being established.
Within the last few weeks it has been noted in our
exchanges that a Chicago company has been formed
for automobile work with a capital of $5,000,000. A
large bicycle manufacturing company in Kenosha,
Wis., has turned the plant into a factory for making
automobiles, and the Elgin Sewing Machine Com
pany of Elgin, 111., has been bought out by a com
pany, which will convert the plant to an automobile
factory.
The demand is sufficient to justify the new enter
prises. Orders for 4000 electric automobiles, to cost
$8,000,000, have just been placed with a New Eng
land manufacturing company, and a Chicago firm has
taken a contract to furnish Paris with 5000 electro
mobiles. These items are gathered from the records
of the news within the past two weeks. They repre
sent only what is new, and nothing of the great works
previously established and the large orders given in
the past. Wall street, it will be seen, is wise in keep
ing an eye on the automobile as a competitor to rail
roads.
WHEN OUR BOYS COME HOME.
WHILE the departure of the California volun
teers from the Philippines has been delayed
by the typhoons that now prevail there, it is
but a short time when the transports will start on
the voyage home. It is therefore timely to begin
preparations on an extensive scale for their welcome.
There was a great public demonstration of pride
in their patriotic valor when they set forth from the
city to engage in the war. At that time the excite
ment of the contest against Spain was upon the people
and every loyal heart was full of ardor and enthusi
asm. The volunteers represented the patriotism of
the State, and accordingly their farewell was given
amid the roar of guns, the sound of martial music
and the shouts and acclamations of applauding thou
; sands.
They will return to us to find the public mind re
stored to its normal condition, the thoughts of the
people once more intent mainly upon business and
politics, but they must not find any sign of lessened
esteem for their valor and their service. The hearts
of the people have lost none of the ardor that was
felt for them when they sailed away, and that fact
must be made clear by the cordiality, the stately cere
mony and the outburst of popular enthusiasm when
they return.
For an occasion of the kind nothing must be left
to chance. The State, the city and the various organ
izations, civic and military, among the people should
unite in preparing a grand welcome. There was a
holiday when they left us to fight for the flag, and
there should be two or three holidays when they re
turn with their standards crowned with the garlands
of victory. Let all those having authority in such mat
ters set about making preparations for the reception
at once. There is no danger of overdoing it. We
cannot do too much to show forth the love and the
honor due to our heroes.

Era of Long-Distance Riding.
Now that an automobile has left New
York for San Francisco the era of long
distance riding in self-propelling vehicles
may be said to have begun in the United
States. The longest distance heretofore
attempted has been 720 miles, between
Cleveland and New York, but in Europe
trips of several thousand miles have been
made. The journey to San Francisco will
be 3700 miles in extent and require many
weeks, the progress of the machine in the
Rocky Mountain region and across the
muddy prairies being prospectively slow
and difficult. It is now just fifty years
since the exodus to California in conse

the fact of their engagement, and
that as soon as their contract ex

A YOUTHFUL BURGLAR
WHO ROBS POOR BOXES
Out of the Sanctuary Into the Law's .Grasp.
FRED MILLER, a young Norwegian, who claims to be only nineteen
years old, was' caught by Policeman Floyd early yesterday morning
In an attempt to rob the poor boxes of Sacred Heart Church, at the
corner of Fell and Fillmore streets. Miller's partner in crime. Charles
Wilson succeeded in making his escape, but the police hope to locate
him before long. When searched at the City Prison a British bulldog re
volver two false mustaches and a burglar's chisel were found concealed on
Miller's person. In addition to being charged with burglary Miller will have to
answer a charge of carrying concealed weapons. The burglars effected an
entrance to the church by prying open the tower window on th* Fillmore
street side. Inside the window is a massive iron gate, and this barred their
progress and saved the poor boxes from being rifled.
After making several futile efforts to find a way into the vestibule of the
church the thieves gave up In disgust and climbed back to the open window.
Wilson got out first, and as he did so Policeman Floyd, who was standing
across the street, saw him and gave chase. Wilson had a good start, and
a-* Floyd saw Miller clambering out of the window he ran back in time to
catch him. The burglar attempted to make a dash for liberty, but Floyd
drew his revolver and soon brought him to a standstill.
About a month ago the poor boxes of Sacred Heart Church were robbed
and the police and clergy believe that Miller and his partner are responsible
for the theft. Miller appeared fore Judge Conlan yesterday morning and
waived his examination. His case was postponed until next Friday.

EVIDENCE FAVORABLE
TO MINNIE ADAMS
DEFENSE SCORES A FEW MATE
RIAL POINTS.
Cross-Examination of a Witness Al
most Results in a Battle Between
Opposing Counsel and a
Continuance Results.
Yesterday's session of the trial of Mrs.
Minnie Adams, charged with the murder
of her infant son. John Richard Gray, al
most ended in a free for all fight shortly
after 4 o'clock. Some unusual actions on
the part of Assistant District Attorney
Salomon roused the anger of Attorney
Mack, who represents the accused, and
when Mack saw that his anger was get
ting the best of him he blandly asked the
court to adjourn. Judge Lawlor, under
standing the reason for the request, Im
mediately ordered an adjournment and
the prompt withdrawal of Salomon avert
ed a disturbance.
Officer Herlihy was undergoing cross
examination and was not enjoying the
grill in the least, when Salomon made
some remark and then smiled blandly at
the jury. Another smile at the jury from
Salomon resulted in Mack losing his tem
per.
"1 object to the prosecuting attorney
grinning at the jury in an effort to cast
a reflection on the efforts in behalf of
the defendant," said Mack. "It is un
called for and decidedly ungentlemanly."
Attorney Salomon arose and started on
a lengthy oration, all the while smiling
at opposing counsel. Mack saw that he
could stand it no longer, and asked for a
continuance. It was granted, and Salo
mon was deprived of the privilege of con
cluding his answer to the charge of un
gentlemanly conduct.
The little difficulty between counsel was
but the closing scene of an interesting
day. The defense succeeded in weaken
ing the case of the prosecution. Officer
J. P. Harrington was called by the de
fense and brought the records of the
O'Farrell street, station with him. The
record shows that Officer Herlihy, who
said that he saw Mrs. Adams leave the
drug store at the corner of Geary and
Devisadero streets ten minutes before 9
o'clock, tear off a label from a bottle and
throw it on the sidewalk, was at the sta
tion at 9:45 o'clock. He also remained
around there a few minutes and in con
sequence, if the records uo not lie. could
not have been at the corner mentioned
at the hour named. This was a hard
blow to the prosecution. Next Conductor
Herring of the Geary street car. on which
Gripman O. T. Cox said Mrs. Adams pro
ceeded to her home after leaving the drug
store, testified that he did not see any
woman get on the car as testified by Cox.
Cox said that the woman went inside the
car and he noticed her look around to
ward the drug store. Herring, who. if
that be true, must have been near her
all the time, collected her fare and
stopped the car for her to get off at Par
ker avenue, if she got off there as al
leged, remembered none of these things.
He remembered no woman nor any of the
Incidents set forth. When Herring left
the stand Herlihy was called, the trou
ble between counsel arose and the case
was continued until this morning.
"Long before I met you I had heard of
your family," said the count. "Yes," re
plied the beautiful girl, coldly. "I believe
papa Is nuoted in Bradstreet's."â Chicago

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jul: 24.â There was little
change in the Stock Exchange to-day. business
continuing at the same low ebb as last week.
which was the smallest week's business in the
year. The break of Consolidated Gas of 2% i
and a decline of over a point in Sugar turned
prices downward in the morning, but the j
bears were not disposed to be aggressive. Late
in the day an active demand developed for
New York Central, which lifted that stock 1% .
from the early low point. The whole market i
hardened in sympathy, Pennsylvania being ]
conspicuously affected. The early fractional j
losses were thus wiped out and final prices
were a shade above those of Saturday as a
rule. There, were a few wide movements In 1
the prices of individual stocks. Manhattan, I
Federal Steel. American Linseed Oil preferred
[arid Lead were heavy at one time and j
General Elect fell off a fraction, but lat- ,
er rose over two points, closing at 121%.
Pittsburg, C. c and St. Louis. St. Louis and
Southwestern preferred; lowa Central stocks,
Pressed Steel Car stocks and a few others j
made some display of strength. Th.- money I
market of the world showed relaxation from!
the recent strain, discounts In London and in !
Berlin declining an additional fraction, but ;
while anxiety over the money outlook is for
the moment "relieved, there is a general feel
ing that higher rates will rule in the near fu- [
ture. Local money lenders are disinclined to
lend money on time at present rates, believing j
that higher rates will prevail later. The ac
tivity ot business in this country, coupled with
the demand for money to move the crops. Is 1
expected to furnish employment for all avail- I
able funds. Owing to the activity of trade |
both in England and Germany, the large spec
ulative commitments at Paris and at Berlin. â 
there .will undoubtedly be a demand to bor
r.cw on credits established by the United States
on account of food exports. Such loans were
made on a large scale last year, but It is evi
dent that higher rates of interest will be re- \
quired to prevent the calling home of this
country's credit during the coming months,
' owing to the increased opportunities for em
ployment of money at home. It is, this situa
tion which : -as haused a halt in speculation
in securities both in this country and abroad.
Bonds were dull and narrow to-day and :
changes in piice.s were mixed. Total sales,

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
As intimated in Sunday's Call, there has cvi
'â¢ dently been a mistake regarding the offer of

I the very lowest base price mentioned thus far
| for anything in the shape of a Prune.

The report from the Consolidated California
and Virginia mine for Repast week Ism fol
lows: "The Comstoek Pumping Association
ha- been engaged in the following work at the
,- and C. shaft during the past **Â«Â«*â  M â¢
lev.- -The west drift has been extended 20
feet â¢'{a,. 722 feet. The face is in quartz
seams of clay and porphyry. At a point T>o
feet back of the face of this drift **Â£*""Â»
clay wall was cut through, and from that <
olnt into the face there are alternating
streaks of quartz and porphyry â¢^Assays mane .
â¢rem this formation have ranged from $1 to |
ijperton, the value of the ore being largely
in gold. The drift has passed 9 feet .beyond
where connection should have been made with
the old workings as shown by the maps on file
In this of lice, but no such workings have been
encountered 1650 levelâ Necessary repairs are
{ "ing made on this level. 1750 level-The slopes
have been extended upward one set and for |
three sets in length, making the fourth floor,
and to the east and south one set on the third
floor. While extending the sets we haye 'ex
tracted 75.3 tons of ore of a gold value of $18.88
per ton and 75 tons having a gold value of $8.88
per ton. From the second floor a, southwest
drift was started on the clay wall forming the
north boundary of th" new ore. The drift has I
been extended 64 feet, the face being In a ]
heavy clay wall. The course of this clay seems
to "â¢# west of south. In following the clay |
wall- ith this drift, at 8 point 1!' feet in from j
â¢â¢he stope. having run through low-grade ore I
for that distance, an old Btope was cut Into,
the stope being 1- feet wide, 10 feet long an.i j
four Boors above the 1750. The fillings in this ]
stoj.e assay: ('old, $18.60; silver, 12.70 ounces
per ton. As near as can be determined the
top of the stupe Is In sight, but we have been
unable to examine or sample it. At a point 17
feet back from the face of the drift a mass of
ore was cut into five feet thick, assaying from |
$14 to $18 per ton. From the 1750 Slopes there
have been extracted to date 443 tons of $15.96 ,
ore and 161 tons of $8.34 ore. 1800 levelâ The
south drift vv cleaned out and retlmbered for
a distance of 42 feet, making a total length of
112 feet. This drift Is quite full Of rock and
the timbers have to be replaced. The sides i
of this drift show quartz and porphyry, the (
percentage of quartz increasing as we go â 
south. The meachinery Is all In good working
order. The hoisting works have been white
washed and the boiler room closed up so the â 
dust . cannot now enter the engine room and ;
some changes have been made in the boiler |
room that will permit of the work being more
easily done. This report will conclude the |
operations of the Comstoek Pumping Associa
tion in the development and extraction of ore
for and on account of the Con. Cal. and Va.
Company, as the new superintendent, Joseph
1; Ryan, has taken charge of this part of the j
work."
The official report from the Ophir mine for
the past week is as follows: "No underground
work has been done the past week through the
Ophir shaft. Central tunnelâ The joint Mexi
can west crosscut was advanced 19 feet; total I
length, 45 feet; face In porphyry with seams i
of clay. From the old workings referred to in
last week's report ten cars of ore were ex
tracted of a gold value of $11 per ton.
Sutro tunnel connectionâ Sutro tunnel
direct connection was extended 4 feet 6 Inches;
total 265 feet 6 inches; face In the hardest
hanging wall rock we have yet found. Ar- |
rangements are being made to carry com- .
pressed air into the drift so that machine ;
drills can be us.-.l in extending it. Work has
been continued in the southwest drift and the
drift extended S feet; tote 1 length 69 feet: face
in quartz and porphyry, the porphyry forming
the .hanging wall of the vein. During the
week samples from the face have shown values
ranging from 50c to $6 50 per ton."
In the Chollar and Potosi mines the joint
west tunnel has been advanced during the
week 21 feet; total length, 323 feet; face in
clay containing bowlders of quartz of low
grade. At a point 323 feet from the mouth of
the drift they cut one set to the south for
putting down a switch. On the tunnel level,
they have one man on repairs. The joint Bul
llon-Potoai west crosscut has been advanced 13
feet; total length. 272 feet: face In clay, quartz
and prrphyry. Sutro tunnel levelâ The /*nlig

HOT WEATHER MEALS AND
PERSONAL COMFORT.
Fruit of some kind should be used at
the breakfast during hot weather. Fol-
low this with a dish of four heaping
teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts, cold, and
treated with rich, cold cream. This
dish gives the staying qualities neces-
sary. Add a slice or two of entire wheat
bread, with a very little butter or
Grape-Nut Butter, which is a different
article than Grape-Nuts proper. Use
no meat for th.? hot weather breakfast.
Let meat appear but once a day during
this season of the year.
A little care in the selection of food
will help one through the heat of the
day in a way that will not easily be
forgotten. Price 15 cents per package, j

A MYSTERY'S SOLUTION.
J. T. Campbell May Have Committed
Suicide at Seattle.
SEATTLE, July 24.â A letter addressed
"To Whom It May Concern," found on
the water front last night, leads to the
belief that J. T. Campbell of Berkeley,
Cal., ended his life by drowning himself.
The' letter, after stating that Campbell j
did. not know how or when he came to
this city, concluded as follows:
"I shall end my life on this earth by
dropping my body in the bay with the
hope that it will never be recovered."
BERKELEY, July 24.â foregoing
telegram is thought to clear up the mys- i
tery over the disappearance of a Berkeley j
man of that name.
Until within a month ago John T. j
Campbell was employed as a special offi
cer to patrol the grounds of the Univer- i
sity of California. His family, consisting
of a wife, son and daughter, reside in
the university town. Campbell left this
city one day to walk to the house of some
relatives in Niles. For some reason, yet
unexplained, he never reached the latter
place, although Scarcely a day's walk
from here. His friends and relatives held
grave apprehensions that possibly he had
met with foul play on the road, but no
traces of his body nor any clew as to
his whereabouts have reached the family
since he left home. -; : "
The news from Seattle only leaves the
mystery of his wanderings alt the deeper. i
Previous to starting he showed no sign ;
of any mental derangement or of any
thing that would indicate that he had
not full control of all his faculties. His
friends here can think of no motive which
would be likely to have headed him for
Seattle as he has no relatives there.
Campbell was about 50 years of age
and of medium stature. His hair was
gray, also his beard, and his face had a '.
ruddy complexion. He habitually wore a j
dark serge suit and was so attired on i
leaving home. j

FOUGHT LIKE FIENDS
WITH BARE KNUCKLES
OAKLAND, July 24.â details of a '
bloody fight with bare knuckles, lasting
over half an hour, have just come to light.
The duel was fought a few evenings ago
between George Janvrin, aged 27 years,
and Dick Hallahan, aged 22, a son of j
"Mike" Hallahan of the Second Ward. |
The battle, it is said, was the climax of
a grudge the two young men bore each
other, and was fought in a lot quite thick
ly grown with trees at Twenty-second
and Market streets, and was witnessed by
nearly seventy spectators, friends of the
parties, who had been let into the secret.
There were no gloves, no referee and no
rounds, but at the end of about half an
hour, after a desperate encounter. Jan
vrin fell to the ground exhausted, and
Hallahan was cheered as victor of the
day, although he had lost three teeth.
Janvrin's face was badly beaten and cut.

Watchman on the Monitor Camanche
Narrowly Escapes Roasting.
OAKLAND, July 24.â One of the watch- j
men on the old monitor Camanche had a ;
narrow escape last night from being j
burned to death. The old hulk is still on
fire in the estuary, and it if estimated !
that another day must pass before all the !
Interior woodwork will be consumed.
Last evening the Camanche's purchasers
started fires In several parts of the hold |
for the purpose of disposing of the heavy i
woodwork in the hold, which is so secure
ly fastened that it would not pay to dis
mantle it with labor. After starting the I
fires the hulk was towed Into the middle j
of the estuary, where the woodwork is
still burning. Last night one of the watch- j
men on board lay down for a short rest
some distance from where the woodwork
was on fire. He reckoned that he would
have plenty of time to wake up before
the tire should reach where he was reclin
ing. His reckoning was greatly at fault,
for the flames worked around him quicker
than he anticipated. He was in the mid
dle of fire and his clothes were already
smoldering when a loud toot from a pass
ing steamer awoke him Just in time to
save his life.

i HIS DEAD BODY FOUND IN BEAR

â Â»
Went Into an Outhouse and Sent a
Bullet Crashing Through His
Brain â Motives for the
Deed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 24.
The body of Charles D. O'Gara. who had
been missing from his home, 371 Fifth
street since last Wednesday, was found
this afternoon in a closet at the rear of
his saloon, corner of Franklin and Sev
enth streets, with a bullethole through
his temples.
The saloon had remained closed alnce
last Wednesday night, and Mrs. O'Gara
was under the Impression that her hus
band had left the city for a few days,
as he said he had intended doing last
Tuesday when she returned from a few
weeks' "outing in the country. Receiving
no letter from her spouse. Mrs. O'Gara
visited the saloon, and, finding It locked
and apparently deserted, she requested
Officers Arnest and Morrison to investi
gate. The officers broke the pane In the
glass door on the Seventh-street side of
the place, and, quickly making an
inspection, found the dead body of
the missing man in the closet.
By his side lay a .'""-caliber revolver.
His shoes had been removed and
were found near a table in the barroom,
while his hat. tie and collar lay on a
table in the cardroom. A note was found
giving a reason for the suicide, which
was probably committed some time after
midnight on Thursday morning.
Mrs. O'Gara stated that she knew of no
justification for her husband's Act. but
those who were close friends of the de
ceased attribute the suicide to financial
and family troubles. Only about a month
ago O'Oara'a saloon was attached by the
Sheriff for $307 in the suit of Mrs. Mary M
Brockhage brought against the deceased
as bondsman for M. T. Dusinbury. E. 11.
liac-k-tt was also bondsman, and both
had refused to satisfy the guarantee of
the bond. As a result most of O'Gara's
stock and fixtures had been taken by the
Sheriff.
Friends of the deceased assert that
when Mrs. O'Gara learned of the attach
ment on her return she upbraided her
spouse for having got into financial
straits; also that she scolded on account
of a published statement to the effect
that Mrs Charles Grimm of Alameda,
who had deserted her little children to go
to a carousal, had been a visitor to his
saloon. Since then O'Gara began drink
ing heavily, finally ending his troubles by
sendlng a bullet through his head.
The remains were taken to the Morgue
and Coroner Mehrmann will hold an in
quest to-morrow night.
Deceased was a native of Ireland, aged
37 years. He had taken quite a prominent
part in local Democratic politics. During
the last municipal campaign he was a
candidate for the nomination of Council
man at large. He was a first cousin of
Mike O'Gara. the Democratic politician.
He leaves a widow and three children.

YOUNG CORBETT LOSES
TO BILLY ROTCHFORD
Makes a Game Showing in His First
Fight Against a Top
notcher.
â DENVER. July 24.-Billy Rotchford of
Chicago, who claims the world's bantam
weight championship through his tight
with Pedlar Palmer of England some time
ago, was given the decision over "Young
Corbett of Denver at the end of the
twentieth round before the Colorado Ath
letic Association to-night. It was an
nounced at the beginning that the bout
was for the bantam-weight championship
of the West. Rotchford received the -_c
cislon through his aggressiveness and
superior cleverness. Even then it was
said by many present he was not at his
usual fighting speed.
Corbett was game and displayed remark
able recuperative powers. , He was worn
and groggy several times, but would sud
denly recover his strength and agility and
force Billy to assume the defensive. Th.s
is really the only first-class man Corbett
has ever met In the fighting arena and
although he exhibited neryouenaÃ at
first hi soon discovered that Bo^ifâ¢/
blows did not do him very great damage ,
and he took punishment without fi inch
ing. He was unable to counter \er> suc
cessfully on Billy, and his swings were
invariably disastrous, enabling Rotchfora
to duck and uppercut with force.
Young Corbett was several pounds over
weight the agreed limit being 120 .pounds,
and Rotchford did not tip weighed
in this afternoon. His weight was i *.ari
ouslv stated to be from 113 to IK pounds,
while some said Corbett tipped the beam
close to 125 pounds. Billy Woods the of
ficial referee of the club, served in that
capacity to-night. Two thousand persons
witnessed the bouts. There WM a W
amount of money up on the Rotcn.ora-
Corbett fight at odds of 2 to 1. Â
The preliminary was between Faddy
Malonev of San Francisco and Jimmy
Coogan of Denver, ten rounds. In the
first three rounds honors were divided.
The fourth, fifth and sixth were Molo
ney's. He put several hard Jolts to the
head and body and blocked well. The
seventh was a furious one. Coogan Parted
the flesh under Maloney s right _ eje,
bringing the blood, and later started It
flowing from Maloney'S nose by a hard
right jab on that member. In the eighth
and ninth Maloney seemed to get the*- bet
ter of the mix-ups, which were many.
Honors were even in the tenth both being
cautious, and the referee called It a draw.

places as high as eight feet. To get an

FISTIC ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN MERCHANTS
A TALE TOLD IN WHISPERS ON
'CHANGE.
Henry Cahen of the California Fruit
Company and Frank Johnson
of the Johnson-Locke
Company Clash.
There was a clash of business Interests
on California street the other day thai
set the tongues of the commercial dis
trict wagging good naturedly.
The collision was between the Johnson-
Locke Company and the California Fruit
Company. The principals were Henry
Cahen. manager of the last named cor
poration, and Frank Johnson. The clash
was one of fists and not of finances and
occurred in a well-known cafe frequented
by business men during the noon hour.
There are many conflicting tales told of
the affray. Some say no blows were
struck; others that Frank Johnson "put
it all over" i.- adversary; others again
that Mr. Cahen offered a vigorous and
successful defense.
They met in the cafe at 120 California
street at noon. Mr. Johnson, according
to a popular version of the story on
Change, asked Mr. Cahen whether he
Mr. Cahen) had dared to say that he
(Mr. Johnson) had an entire absence of
principle Mr. Cahen is said to have re
plied 'hat he never made such a remark.
Mr. Johnson is reported to have insisted
that he did.
Thereafter, say the tellers of the tale,
Mr. Johnson caused the flush of a coun
ter irritation to Hood Mr. Cahen's lace,
and followed up the open-hand argument
by closing his fists and belaboring hi;
adversary ad libitum. Then friends
stepped in, the combatants were separated
and have since then never spoken to each
other as they have passed by along the
great commercial thoroughfare of the
town.
Now this Is only one of the stories told.
There are others. But they unite in sav
ing that there was a row, that hot words
ensued and that at least some effort was
made by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Cahen to
punish each other without due process
of law, using those means provided for
In the economy of the human anatomy.
Even the date of the battle is in doubt.
Pome say it occurred last AY ednesday.
Mr. Cahen says it took place several
weeks ago, and declares that he not only
has no marks of the fray, but that he
has forgotten the time, the place, and
even the circumstance. Â-,. - .
"Mr. Johnson and I, said Mr. Cahen
last evening, "did have a little misunder
standing, butâ pshaw! there were no
blows struck. I certainly was not hit.
It was not an affair of the heart, nor one
arising out of business relations which
caused the late unpleasantness. It was
entirely a personal matter. I really do
not desire to discuss it. Mr. Johnson and
I have remedied our differences and are
friends. The whole matter is dead and
buried." . Â ,
Here again the Inevitable genius of
rumor steps in to gainsay the responsible
statement of one of the principals, for on
the street it is declared that whereas Air.
Johnson and Cahen were always In the
habit of sharing together their midday
meal, Mr. Johnson still lunches at the
scene of the late alleged battle, while Mr.
Cahen dines at another restaurant where
Mr. Johnson is not.
At any rate, an armistice has been de
clared, for hostilities have not been re
sumed since the date of the first conflict.
Mr Johnson is in the country and his
side of the story is yet to be related.

AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS.
Mrs. Olbrecht, a Centenarian, in
Need of a Guardian.
After over 100 years of toil and saving
Mrs. Ann Olbrecht has accumulated prop
erty valued at $109,000, but now her mind
is clouded with age, and yesterday Mrs.
Sarah Borland made application to be ap
pointed guardian of the. centenarian's es
tate. Mrs. Olbrecht, it is alleged In the
petition, was born in Germany June 29,
1798. She has $74,000 on deposit in the
Hibernia Bank and property on Mason
street valued at $35,000. Mrs. Borland, who
is a niece of the centenarian, alleges that
by reason of her great age she Is weak
to both body and mind, is incompetent in
consequence to manage her property, and
i there is danger that she may lose it or
'be imposed upon and give it away. Al
-1 though wealthy, Mrs. Olbrecht, it Is said
I by the petitioner, has for some years past
refused to support herself, and in conse
quence Mrs. Borland has been forced to
bear the expense. The petition will be
heard by Judge Troutt to-morrow.
ASH BARRELS CONDEMNED.
j Board of Health Begins Its Inspec
â  tion of Chinatown.
The Board of Health descended en force
i upon Chinatown yesterday and condemned '
two broken down ash barrels and a de
! fective sewer connection. It was the first
I day of what the board intends shall be a
thorough house to house inspection, and it
was participated in Uy a _quad of eight
police. Inspectors Devoto. Gans, Benja
min and Beyreuther and Secretary Den
nery and Dr. Lawlor.
Merely a cursory survey of the district
was taken in order that a definite plan
of action might be better mapped out. Be
yond an inspection of the Hotel Nymphia,
the condemnation of a sewer connection
at 705 Stockton street and the suggestion
to a couple of property owners that iron
ash barrels be used Instead of the wooden
ones on the premises, nothing was done.
The inspectors and police will resume
i their duties this morning.

Petitions Presented and Resolutions
â Market-Street Railway
Sends in Its Annual Finan
cial Report.
The Supervisors, with his Honor the
Mayor in the chair, listened yesterday
afternoon to deputations from the Health
Department, the County Clerk's office, the
City and County Hospital and the Street
Department, all intent upon impressing
the minds of the city fathers that the
appropriations allowed them under the $1
tax levy will fall far short of the actual
and absolute necessities of each depart
ment. --".l:y - . ":â  >-â¢â ".
Supervisors Attrldge, Black, Byington,
Deasy, Heyer, Holland, Kalben, Lack
mann, Perrault and Phelps made up the
quorum. The regular business was waived
and the crying demands of the depart
ment orators were heard.
Joseph Goddard. chief deputy of the
County Clerk, was given first chance. He
took oath that $90,000 was the minimum
limit at which his office could exist. The
former figure allowed was $110, and
less than $90,000, he said, would be de
structive. "The business of the office will
be paralyzed and crippled and the work
never up to date unless we get at least
$90,000," iterated Goddard, after reading
a tabulated statement which contained
the records of former years and which
he produced as conclusive evidence of his
case.
Dr. Sussdorf was the pleader for the
City and County Hospital. He implored
for a raise on account of necessary re
pairs, past expenditures and future im
provements. He claimed that the.re was
no place to isolate contagious diseases;
that the nurses needed a new building,
and many other improvements should be
set on foot. Perrault asked Dr. Sussdorf
if it were true that the Merchants' Asso
ciation would recommend $111,000 for the
use of the City and County Hospital. The
doctor said he had not heard of it, nor
did he have an idea what appropriation he.
would get. " '*â â¢.-
Dr. Barbat trumpeted the demands of
the Health Department.
A. M. Donovan, chief deputy of the
Street Department, recited a long list of
expenses that would have to be Incurred.
He did not see how the $l-*o,4w reduction
could be met, and begged a greater ap
propriation for the life of his department.
W. R. Hewitt of the fire-alarm service
was next, and he likewise displayed a
tendency toward the desire for more.
The Mayor listened patiently, interro
gating the pleaders from time to time. The
entire matter was put over for consider
ation until to-morrow evening at S
o'clock, when the board will convene for
the sole purpose of the discussion of these
demands.
Assessor Dodge has notified the board
of his estimate on taxable properties. It
is as follows:
Honorable Board of Supervisors of the City
and County of San Francisco â Re
plying to your request per resolution No. 3163
(fourth series), would say I think it safe to
estimate tZS6 000, 000. with of course the usual
allowances for shrinkage due to delinquencies,
etc. The amount on the rolls over and above
$356. 000, 000â namely, about "115,000,000â wi1l be
contested in the courts and in my opinion can
not be safely included in the total of the roll
for the purposes of estimating the rate. Re
spectfully yours, WASHINGTON DODGE.
Upon a resolution introduced by Holland
to close the Nymphla. Thomas B. O'Brien,
representing a committee to state the op
position to these houses of ill fame on the
part of the residents of that district, arose
and set forth the requests of his constit
uents. The board immediately voted upon
the resolution and the Nymphla received
its final death stroke. It was declared a
public nuisance and was ordered closed.
A resolution was adopted directing the
experts of the board to prepare a list of
supplies furnished the various depart
ments not under contract during the last
three months, together with tne prices
charged for the various articles. A copy
of the list must be furnished to each of
the board before July 31.
E. J. Baldwin has petitioned the Super
visors for permission to place a metal or
asphaltum roof on the premises known
us the Baldwin Hotel building, over the
first story, with thirteen-lnch brick par
tition walls not more than 100 feet apart,
and finish the stores and basements for
rental. , . _ ,
The Mayor's A*eto of the resolution al
lowing pool-selling and betting at dog
races was sustained. Deasy, Heyer, Hoi
land, Lackmann and Byington voted
against it. '--'-''.''?-- ', i, Â _
Holland withdrew his resolution which
provided for a reception committee to wel

WELCOME HOME FOR
NEBRASKA'S HEROES
A Repetition of the Examiner Out=
rage to Be Prevented,
Governor Poynter Will Provide the Returning Troops
With All the Clothing They Needâ A Royal
Reception Promised by Officials.
THE Examiner will have no oppor
tunity to seek out of the Nebraska
troops such cheap and shameful
notoriety as whs sought to be
gained out of the Oregon volun
teers. Congressman H. J. Starke of
Nebraska and T. H. Barry of the same
State have arrived in the city to await
.the coming of the Nebraska troops
from the Philippines. The distin
guished visitors will be joined to-day
by ths Governor of Nebraska, who will
head the Avelcoming legation and give
to he returning soldiers an official
greeting and congratulations. The Ne
braska officers are proud of the record
of their State volunteers in the Philip
pines and careful preparations have
been made to make the soldiers feel
that their valor is honored by those
that know them in their homes.
First of all, the visitors will see that
every Nebraska trooper that needs
clothing of any sort will be amply and
quickly provided for without the im
pertinent and uncalled for suggestion
or interference of the local yellow jour
nal. The soldiers will have ail they
need, if they need any, owing to the
forethought and provision of the State
authorities of Nebraska. One lesson of
indecent greed for notoriety, such as
the Examiner showed in reference to
the Oregon troops, was enough for the
returning volunteers.
The soldiers of Nebraska are expected
to arrive in the city next Saturday.
They will be welcomed by the high rep
resentatives of their own State and un
questionably receive the honors that
were shown by the people of San Fran
cisco to the soldiers of Oregon. Con- ;
egress-man Starke and Adjutant General
Barry have thought very little of pleas- j
ure since their arrival here. Their pur- |
pose in coming was to prepare a Avel- j
come to the troops of their State, and
this the visitors set about doing at
once.
During the day the visitors were the
guests of Congressman Julius Kahn. i
They were introduced to prominent !
Federal officials at this port and to the
members of the State Harbor Commis
sion. Assurances were given that the ;
Government tug is at the service of the
Nebraska representatives whenever it
Is needed. It will probably not be called
into requisition until it steams down
the bay to welcome the returning sol- â 
diers. EA-ery courtesy to the home- |
coming volunteers will be shown by the I
harbor and Federal authorities.
Congressman Starke and Adjutant
General Barry will visit the Presidio to
day to look after the sick and wounded j
soldiers of Nebraska that have already J
returned from the Avar. Nothing that j
may be done to make these men com- j
fortable or to relieve their sufferings J
will be neglected. More than this. Con- j
gressman Starke and Adjutant General j
Barry are determined that the return- i
ing soldiers of Nebraska shall not bee
treated as mendicants. If they need
any underclothing, uniforms or over- |

j tified to this effect and will be shown
! the authority under vvhiclj, the Gover
j nor of Nebraska and his associates act.
The exact form the welcome of the
! Nebraska veterans will assume has
i not, as yet, been definitely settled
. upon, nor wiil the arrangements be
I fully completed until after a consulta-
I tion is had with the Governor, when
| he arrives in this city this evening.
But according to the rough outline
j of the programme, as given last night
j by Cadet Taylor, who has also come
j from Omaha to welcome the boys, who
i have sacrificed so much for the honor
jof their country and their State, a
royal treat will be given. They will
j land and be mustered out in this city.
j Then they will be taken in charge by
I their own people and sent to their
j homes. But they will not go directly
there, unless they SO elect. If they
' wish it, they will be given a little trip
! around the country, taken to the va
rious points of interest and pleasure |
! along their route home and be afforded \
;an opportunity to enjoy themselves [
i generally. Possibly they will go as far j
i north as Portland. The entire expense j
! of the trip will cheerfully be borne by
j the people of the State to which they j
: haA'e brought so much honor and re- j
! nown, Of course this programme is j
: merely problematical. It. as does
everything else, depends entirely upon
I the wishes of the boys themselves.
Mr. Taylor said the first Idea was to :
I take the regiment to Omaha in a body
and, after entertaining it there tor a j
I few days, to send the different com- i
| panics home to the localities where j
, they were first organized. But this j
i plan raised so much protest from the j
I people of those localities who wished
i to be the first to welcome back the
heroes they had sent forth to the wars, ;
\ that it was finally abandoned. Now the
idea is to send each company directly
home as soon as the contemplated ;
' pleasure jaunt is finished.
Mr. Taylor is president of the Thurs
ton Rifies, an organization that was
I formed to care for the armory and look
i after the interests of its absent occu- â ,
pants.
The original Thurston Rides are now j
Company L, of the Nebraska Regiment
and in their ante-bellum days they
were the champion drill corps of the
entire United States.
From the reports we at home have j
: had of them they have certainly lost
none of the excellence of their former
! record.
i Among the returning troops are two
j whom Mr. Taylor will welcome with
I special pride and affection.
They are his sons. Major Wallace C. j
| Taylor and Herbert B. Taylor, first
J sergeant of Company L,.
2415 Buchanan street, was yesterday sen- j
tenced to six months in the County Jail
by Judge Conlan. -".' .

Judge Treadwell held court in Judge
Conlan's courtroom yesterday afternoon
and left his silk hat and cane in tin
chambers. Judge? Conlan had occasion to
go Into the chambers during the after
noon and when leaving unthinkingly
locked the door. Judge Treadwell after
adjourning court had to wait till a ladder
was procured and entrance effected
through the transom before lie got his j
hat and cane.
A bond was accepted by Judge Conlan
Saturday for $2000 for the release of Cad
Williams, the woman held for grand lar- j
ceny, hut yesterday Bond Inspector New- |
man notified the Judge that the bond was j
not sufficient. The sureties were M. Levy,
proprietor of a saloon at IT East street. |
and George W. Wood. The woman was '
surrendered by the bondsmen and Lev) j
said he would put up $1000 cash.
The preliminary examination of John A. -

York streets, was commenced before
Judge Treadwell yesterday. Clarence
Gray, attorney for the defendant, told
the court that Williams had threatened
to shoot Shackleton and asked the pro
tection of the court, but the Judge said
It was only a bluff. After hearing the
evidence of Mrs. Williams the case was
continued.
VALLEY ROAD PROGRESSION.
Chief Engineer W. B. Storey Tells of
tne Work That Is Acccmplish.d.
Captain A. H. Paytson and W. B. Storey
of the Valley road have returned from a
tour they have been making over the line
in the vicinity of Stockton, Bakersfield
and Fresno. They seem quite pleased with
the way the work is progressing and re
port everything favorable along those
portions of the road they' visited.
The three drawbridges over the San
Joaquin. Middle and Old rivers are get
ting along in such shape that it will not
be long before passengers will be trav
eling clear across the entire breadth of
the overflowed lands west of Stockton.
All Hi.- piers of the bridges that will
span the San Joaquin and Middle rivers
are already In, and the piles of the bridge
over Ik' Old river have all been driven
and are now being sawed off. This .saw
lng-off process is being accomplished by
machinery at a depth of thirty feet un
der water. The work on these struc
tures has been considerably delayed by
the difficulty in getting the steel orders
; from the Bast. The factories at which
; they have been placed are so congested
i with work that it has been impossible
feci- them to deliver the goods in any
thing like the time expected. When the
steel does arrive the completion of the
work on the bridges will only be a mat-
I ter of about three months' time.
The Fresno passenger depot Is nearing
I its finish, and in less than sixty days it
is expected to be open for business, It
: Is an exceedingly handsome structure and
has had a great deal of pains and money
expended on its erection. The new yard
! buildings at Bakersfield are all up and
' the workmen there are now merely oc
; cupied in cleaning and doing odds anl
| ends of unfinished work.

THE SA_> T FT-AXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 25, _,-*-9r>.
DEATH SUDDENLY
CALLS LLOYD TEVIS
LLOYD TEVIS, the well known capitalist, died last night at the family
residence, 1316 Taylor street, after an illness of two weeks. At his bed
side at the last moment were Mrs. Tevis. Mrs. Gordon ""'landing, nis
daughter; Dr. Harry Tevis, Hugh Tevis and William S. Tevis, his sons.
The other daughter, Mrs. Fred Sharon, is at present In Paris.
In spite of the fact that Mr. Tevis was 75 years of age no fears of a fatal
termination of his illness were entertained until almost the hour "it" his
death. His years always weighed lightly on him and till within two hours of
the drawing of his last breath the aged capitalist was in full possession of
his mental faculties, showing no sign of approaching dissolution.
A slight cold contracted two weeks ago \esterday was directly responsible
for his death. It settled upon him on the beat coming from San Rafael, at
which place he was stopping with Mrs. Tevis, having closed his town house
for the summer! When he reached his office In the Mills building he com
plained that he was not feeling well. Late in the day he called on his
physician. Dr. Hertzein, at the Waldeck Sanitarium, and upon advice went
to bed in that institution. Next morning he was feeling bright and .well, and
on the succeeding days until a week ago, when he was removed to his Taylor
street residence, he appeared to be recovering.
Until two hours before his death last night he was perfectly conscious
of all that was transpiring around him, and while his children had gathered
at his bedside no one expected that the end was near. From 6 o'clock Mr.
Tevis sank rapidly. He died without a struggle.
Lloyd Tevis was born on March 20, 1 -.24 . In Shelbyville, Ky. When 18 years
of pge he read law under his father and assisted him In his duties as clerk of
the Circuit Court. In 1849, when the discovery of gold in California was the
absorbing excitement, he resolved to try his fortune in the new El Dorado.
He crossed the plains and prospected and dug ln El Dorado County with indif-^
ferent success, and then decided to mine no more. He went to Sacramento
and obtained a position In the Recorder's office. Foreseeing the growth ofj
the capital city, he operated in the purchase of property and in loans. James
B. Haggin. whom he had known in Kentucky, was then In Sacramento, and it
was here that the famous partnership of Haggin & Tevis was formed in
October, 1850. At first It was a partnership of law. but after a few years it
became, from the requirements of Its large capital, investments, enterprises
and interests, a copartnership soleiy of business and finance.
At an early period of telegraphy on this coast Mr. Tevis invested in the
venture, and to such good purpose that, by the management of the negotia
tions by which the State Telegraph Company sold out to the Western Union
Company, he made a clear profit of $_ihi,ooo in a few days without the
placing of a dollar of his own. He was one of the projectors of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, and was president of the company. The sale of the road
and franchises to the corporation now in possession was managed by him.
He was the projector and builder of the California Market In this city.
Mr. Tevis was foremost in starting the Pacific Express Company, which
finally caused Wells, Fargo & Co. to absorb It on conditions which gave to
himself and associates the control of the latter, of which he became the
president. He was a large owner in the Spring Valley Water Company, and
was interested in the Risdon Iron Works and the California-street Railroad.
He owned rich silver and gold mines in California, Nevada, Utah and Idaho,
and was one of the largest owners of improved land In this State. He was
also one of the original stockholders of the Bank of California.
Mr. Tevis was married in Sacramento on April 20. 1854, to Miss Susan G.
Sanders, daughter of Lewis Sanders Jr., a prominent citizen of that city and
also from Kentucky, of which State he had been Attorney General. Mrs.
Tevis and Mrs. Haggin were sisters. Mr. Tevis' widow, three sons and two
daughters survive him.

More than a year ago the engagement
of the editor and the heiress was gos

and accomplished and under the terms
of her father's will has Inherited consid
erable property. Mrs. Hart is a woman
of considerable business ability. She is
the sole manager of the enormous estate
left by her father, and in order to fit her
self for the duties she knew would ulti
mately fall upon her she took a course
at the Hastings Law School while yet
her father lived to guide her with his
wise counsel. Besides her business quali
fications she excels as a sportswoman,
is an excellent driver and a fine swimmer.
Much of the Clark estate Is located in
this city. It Includes the Btudebaker
building at Tenth' and Market streets,
the Pacific-Union Club building and the
structure at the corner of Battery and
Market streets. ' ,:â _ â¢ _. ._

Was Given Knockout Drops.
Guadaloupe Labrada, a Mexican, ' who
arrived in this city last Friday, was given
knockout drops in the Crystal Palace
lodging-house, on Broadway, Sunday
night, after which he was robbed of
about $70 in coin and other valuables. La

accosted by an American on Sunday even
ing, who persisted in becoming familiar
with him. The latter followed the Mexi
can for several blocks and the pair were
Introduced by a Spaniard on Kearny
street later In the evening. Several drinks
were taken and Labrada invited the
American to his rooms in the Crystal Pal
ace lodging-house. When they arrived
there the guest produced two small bot
tles of beer, which the Mexican drank.
He immediately lapsed Into a stupor,
from which he awakened yesterday morn

Justice of the Peace Quinn of Oakland
Performed the Ceremony, and
Now the Young Couple
Are Happy.
Ethel Johnson*, petite and pretty, with
seventeen summers over her fluffy head, ;
I and Ellis Sweeney; a young dentist, who
| is quite a prominent figure on "the line,"
were star performers in a quiet elope
ment to Oakland last Friday morning,
where they were made man and wife very
much against the wishes of their parents.
Miss Johnson attended the Polytechnic ;
I High School and has hosts of friends in i
I this city. She resides at 522 Ellis street.
The marriage ceremony was performed i
by Justice of the Peace Quinn. The young
couple had only known each other a few
j weeks. They met at a social function held
j recently at the home of one of the young .
j lady's friends, and the sweet story of love
j at first sight they whispered into each
! other's ears.
Miss Johnson knew her parents would
enter strenuous objections to a union with j
her loved one, for it was "all so sudden,"
art she yet had three long years to send
the way of all things before she would
leave the memory of her "teens" to the
past, to be resurrected only by the scrib
bling in her school books or the initials of
her best young man scratched on the book
strap which he was so fond of swinging
on the way home. But the mere matter |
of parental objection was a trivial cir
cumstance, not to be considered seriously
when life's happiness was at stake, ac
cording to the argument advanced by the ,
young dentist, and Ethel Johnson deter
mined to become his bride.
Arrangements for the elopement were
made quietly, and the parents of the
young folks did not get even as much as |
an inkling of the Impending match.
At 9 o'clock Monday morning Miss John- !
son and her husband to be met at the
ferry. H> was accompanied by Rege
Moen, an Intimate friend, and she by her
cousin Miss Edna Rock, who resides at
320 Polk street. '
They took an early boat across the bay,
procured a license and then ushered them
selves into the presence of Justice Quinn ;
to have the knot tied.
After th.- ceremony the bridal party re
turned to this city and celebrated the oc- i
casion at a first-class rotisserie.
Of course, explanations of the runaway
match were made to the parents on both I
sides, and of course mamma and papa I
were quite angry, but they have as yet
made no attempt to separate the swain i
from his young bride.
HOME FOR ABANDONED
BABES OF THE CITY
Interesting Statistics of tho Sau
Francisco Foundling Asylum,
for Twelve Months.
The annual report of the San Francisco
Lying-in Hospital and Foundling Asylum
for the fiscal year just ended is an inter
esting commentary on the waywardness
of a great city as well as a remarkable
tribute to the work of a notable charity.
L>uring the period covered by the report
forty-eight infants, most of them only a
few days old. were received in the recep
tacle for babes placed outside the asylum
quarters at 913 Golden Gate avenue. The
unfortunate mothers who have thus can
signed their little ones to the mercy and
charity of the world do not. know per
haps, that the asylum authorities have
an electrical appliance by which a bell
is rung as soon as a baby Is placed in the
basket at the door. The furtive mother
who places her babe in the "crib," as it
is called, almost immediately arouses the
vigilant attendants of the foundling home
thereby.
During the year eight children were
born in the asylum, two were taken away
by the mothers, five died, twenty-three
were adopted, four are in other homes
and twenty-two are in the house at
present.
In connection with the home there is
a training school for nursery maids now.
These I,'iris are paid $5 a month for their
services and are taught by a deliberate
course of instruction how to care lor
young children. After following a course
of training they are graduated and pre
sented with diplomas certifying that they
arc- competent In their work. The com
mencement exercises of the first class of
trained maids will be held at the Florence
Crlttenton Home in the lirst week of Au
gust
The home now has seven rooms for
the use of mothers and the arrangement
of wards for the children provides all
hygienic needs required to protect and en
courage infant life.

THE RIGHTS OF DEPOSITORS.
A Bank in Liquidation Is Not Exempt
From Civil Action.
A decision of Lie Supreme Court handed
down yesterday will be of no little import
ance to a number of depositors of the
Fresno Loan and Savings Bank. A year
or so ago this institution was directed by
the Bank Commissioners to levy an as
sessment of $10 per sh. re. in order to
carry on the business in a safe manner.
This the directors refused to do, and the
commissioners directed that the bank
should go Into liquidation. Demand was
made by some of the depositors for the
money they hart placed with the bank,
which was refused, and suit was begun
for the recovery of the deposits.
The defense was that, being in liquida
tion the bank was not subject to suit by
the depositors, and this was sustained by
the lower court. This was badly upset
by the Supreme Court. The latter tri
bunal sets up as the law that when a
bank goes into liquidation, and while its
doors may be closed to the creditors by
the directors, still the directors cannot
close the doors to the court: also that the
right of action by the creditors is the
same as though the doors of the bank had
never been closed, and Its business was
progressing in the usual channels.

Applications for Franchises Made to
Extend the Telegraph and
San Pablo Avenue
Lines.
BERKELEY. July 24.â The all-absorb- j
ing question of the extension of street
railway transportation of the university
town was brought on afresh to-night by
the somewhat precipitate' action of the
Oakland Improvement Company. The
move on the company's part is by far j
th.- most Important development and in j
its easily foreseen consequences the most
considerable thing which has come up in
the business interests of the community
for several years past. Although kept
well under cover until the company was
ready to play its hand, now that the
move has been made and. the Initial step
taken almost the entire number of the
residents of the town are clamoring for its j
fulfillment at the earliest possible date.
Already a most lively interest has mani- I
fested itself In every detail of the plan, \
and this Interest was shown to a marked
degree at the meeting of the Board of
Trustees to-night, when the projected im
provements were first made public.
The cause of this excitement was the
filing with Town Clerk Hanscom of the
Board of Trustees to-night of two appli
cations for franchises by Attorney J. A.
Foulds of the Oakland Improvement Com
pany. The first application calls for the
operation of a street railway connecting
with the line now running on Telegraph'
avenue. The specifications are that the
line shall commence at the junction of
Telegraph avenue and Bancroft way, run
ning then.ee in a westerly direction down
Bancroft way to Shattuck avenue, and
from there turning north and continuing
to North Berkeley.
The second application refers to the
electric line now operated on San Pablo i
avenue. It provides for a continuation of
the line along San Pablo avenue to West
Berkeley, terminating within 100 feet of
University avenue.
When viewed from the standpoint of !
facilities for transportation which the
project offers, no greater boon could be
