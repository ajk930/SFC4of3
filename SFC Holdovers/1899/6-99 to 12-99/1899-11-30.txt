Special Dispatch to The Call,
PHILAJ>F.LPHIA, Nov. Â».â Neari two
: million dollars' worth of property was
destroyed by two fires in the heart of the
bush...-- section of the city early to-day.
I The greater of the two fires started in the
I big department store of Partridge & Rieh
1 ardson, at the southeast corner of JSigULh
and Filbert streets, the very center of the
. shopping district, at 6:30 a. m.. and be
( fore the Barnes had been put under con
trol they spread to adjoining property
and caused â  heavy loss.
While this fire was progressing and
spreading every moment another I i.
broke, out four blocks away on me fourtn
floor .â â¢ 419 Market street. The loss .it
this lire is estimated at $110,uu0. The losbe*
of the two fires are more than covered
by insurance. Th.- Eighth street fire was
a very ugly one for the firemen to handle.
Eighth street and Filbert street are beta
very narrow thoroughfares. There war. a
strong wind blowing at the time, and the
firemen had . eat difficult] in. preventing
the flames from getting a good hold on
the buildings on both sides of these
streets. As It was. many structures and
their contents were badly scorched and
damaged by water. It took four hours to
get thÂ» Uames under control.
The fire started in the basement of Part
ridge & Richardson's store from an elec
tric spark, and soon the entire building
was a mass of flames. The two stores io
the south of Partridge I Richardson w-re
soon gutted, and then the flames attacked
the big building of the J. B. I,ippincott
Publishing Company, on Filbert street,
east of the burning department store. T;,'s
publishing establishment is one of the
nest known In the country, many first
class reference books, periodicals and nu
merous other pabllcatlona being produced
by the firm. Ihe building was completely
ruined. In this building, stored away in
vaults, is nearly a half million dollars'
â worth of manuscripts, plates and other
material for reference books, and it is
not yet known whether they were de
stroyed.
Lit Brothers' large department store,
which adjoins the Llpplncott building and
which Is valued with Its contents at more
than $1,000,000, was saved, but only after
the contents of one corner of the building
had been damaged. Btrawbrldge & Cloth
ier, another large department store on the
â west side of Eighth street also had a.
narrow escape, and the building and con
tents were damaged to the extent of
about $50.(.Â») O. A number of other business
houses, adjoining LJpplncott's and Part
ridge & Richardson's, were either entirely
destroy* d or badly damaged.
The estimated losses are: Partridge <&
Rlchardton. J700.000; J. B. Llpplncott
llshlng Company. $600,000; Artman <&
Trelchler. wholesale bouse furnishings,
$100.0\Â»: Lit Brothers. 185.000; Strawbrldge
& Clothier. JSOAO; Bailey's 5 and' 1 1 cent
store. J.'.0.000; Rosenberg's" millinery store,
530.000; Partridge & Son's restaurant. $20,
000; Westcott & Thompson, electric sup
plies, $10,000. Additional losses, aggre
gating about $25,000, ' were divided
among twelve email concerns. All the.
losses are covered by Insurance.
The second fire was discovered at 7:30
o'clock In the four-story building at 419
Market street, occupied by several man
agers and wholesale dealers. The entire
building was gutted, as was also the ad-
Joining building. No. 417. The estimated
loss Is $110,000. distributed among nine
firms. ThÂ» loss on the buildings is esti
mated at $40,000. j
More than MM persons are thrown out
of work by the. fires, . but , the proprietors
of other department stores offer tempor
ary employment to all of Partridge <*a
Richardson's 900 employes at the salaries
they received from the burned out firm.
Although the big fire raged for more
than four hours, there were no casualties
beyond a few minor injuries received by
a half-dozen firemen,

WITHDRAWAL
OF TROOPS
FROM CUBA
Heavy Reduction in the
American Garrisons on
the Island.
NO FEAR OF REVOLT
General Wood Says Practically All
of the Cubans Have Turned
in Their Arms.
: Mf-i-atrh to The rr 811.B 11.
WASHINGTON, Nov. "(.-General Leon
ard Wood, who reached Washington" last
ntpht. had a two hours' conference with
the Secretary of War to-day. After the
conference Secretary Root announced that
his recommendations as to th.- removal of
troops from Cuba had been approved, and
that orders would be Issued putting them
Into effect.
Qeneral Wood says that in his opinion
all thÂ«> rumors of impending trouble in
Cuba trerÂ« sroundleas; that thÂ»rÂ« was no
: roapeet of a revolt, and that what
i\. r fri< tion and discontent did tairt
among thÂ«- Cuban* waÂ» due to the racuit
talk of a civil K'Â»vertiinÂ»nt on the iÂ»Un'.
\\ h. n ai-k.d ai>out the report of hit se
lÂ«Ctlon for this pusltlon, General Wood
said:
"I do not know a thin* about It. I have
learned nothing of the plan for a civil
governorship other than what I have seen
in the papers. it has not been offered to
me, and I have not been asked for nny
suggestions on the subject. Whatever dis
content may have arisen among the
Cubans on this subject grows, 1 think,
from their misunderstanding of the term
'civil government." 1 rather take It that
they understand it to mean permanc-it
American government for the Island. This
Is only speculation, however; for I heard
nothing of these rumors In Cuba before
I left.
"1 can speak of my own department.
There is no indication of trouble there,
On the contrary, we have had turned in
over MOO rifles. Adding to these arms
that have been retained for the rural
guard and those the natives have kept
for the protection of their own homes in
the outlying districts. I think you will ac
count for all the arms in the province."
When asked if there were any possibil
ity of an outbreak among the rural guard,
General Wood said :
"No more than there is of an Insurrec
tion among the police force Jn Washing
ton. "
Concerning his mission to Washington,
he said that It was merely for consulta
tion about the reduction of the American
force on the Island,
"I have recommended a reduction of
about 20 per cent of the force In my de
partment," said he; "that Is to say. the
recall of the Fifteenth Infantry arid the
removal of a squadron from each of the
cavalry regiments. I think that this Is
perfectly feasible. When I say that San
tiago in quiet. It Is a pretty fair Indica
tion of the condition throughout the Is
land. Every revolution that has started
there has started In Santiago province,
and In the last war 70 per cent of the
troops were drawn from that province."
Regarding the general conditions in his
department, General Wood said that they
were favorable: the courts were being ad
ministered under as mild an American
supervision as was consistent with keep
ing diligently at work and preventing de
lays In the administration of Justice; the
people were being kept reminded that In
case of palpable mal-admlnlstration
through reversion to the old Spanish
methods they had always the right to
appeal and have any matter thoroughly
Investigated; people were being kept em
ployed and the detailed reforms of the
petty courts and the lower school system
were things that would come eventually
through patient work and local educa
tion.
It Is said that the President has de
cided on the reward to be allotted to
General Wood when his term of service
In Cuba Is over. It Is said on good au
thority that General Wood Is elated to
succeed General George M. Sternberg an
surgeon general of the army when the
latter retires by law In June of the com
ing year. It has been reported several
times that General Wood would receive
a brigadier generalship, as he has been
urged for this by some of his friends In
recognition of his services in the Santi
ago campaign and afterward as Governor
of that province. The President has been
Inclined to bestow some substantial recog
nition on him, but It Is well understood
that the gift of a general's commission
In the- lino would cause a great deal of
feeling among the officers of the regular
establishment, many of whom are General
Woods senior by many years. Th.- same
objection may hold to a lesser extent on
the medical staff, but it la urged by the
friends of General Wood that he has
proved himself eminently capable In ad
ministrative work. It Is said that when
ho was last in Washington the matter
was talked over between him and the
President, and that General Wood was
offered the place and accepted It al
though his preference was for a place on
the line. This was at the time he re
fused a very flattering offer from the
street railway syndicate here, a refusal
hardly likely from a staff captain unless
with some very definite prospect of fu
ture preferment In view
The surgeon generalship would nlace
General Wood at the head of the medical
staff of the American army at but a lltt'i,.
over 35 years of age, making htm the
youngest officer ever holding this respon
sible position It would leave him twi-nty
five years of active service If he so de
sired in a position carrying with It great
prestige in the profession, both at home
and abroad. v

âthat of importing an imprint edition of
this Enrltsb weekly. The editor of ' Lit

Jiangs, lias assumed the editorship of the
"Weekly." No editor of the "Hazar" has

The Mr-ulatlon of the "Monthly."
President Harvey said to-day, had been
favorably affected by the reduction of
price. An annual reduction of $120,0<j0 In
the expenses of the house had been ef
fected, chiefly by reducing salaries. Mr.
Pago, and Dr. Kindley have Joined the
Ftaff of the Doubleday & McClure Com

ed the promised encyclopedia and the
new 10-cent magazine.
President 'Harvey says that the North

recital of this testimony Senator Cutter
was frequently assisted by the excellent
memory of Hugh Huchanan. who was
present In court, in deciphering the names

J. EL McDowell. T. J. Downing Mrs. C.
M. Higgonsou. Thomas Shields Drs â¢'
H. Wheeler and G. H. Flett. all of Sis
tons, had their testimony repeated by
fcenator Cutter. Kach had expressed the
opinion that ichanan was not perfectly
sanÂ«\ but under cross-examination eacn
In turn admitted that Huchanan was a.l
dteted. to the usÂ« of liquor, and that many
of his acts which they described as pecu
liar might have been committed after he
had been bending his elbow too frequent
ly. A rather unexpected turn was riven
the case just before the reading of Dr.
biett'a testimony. District Attorney H.-il.
who Is in the case us a friend of the
court, but who is assisting in making a
determined effort in behalf of Huchanan.
objected to Flett's testimony ns being
cumulative. He declared the object of the
present hearing was to establish Buchan
an's sanity nt this time, not to attack the
judgment of the court which found him
Insane. Hell said he admitted Huchanrm
might have been insane at that time. At
torney Anderson, on behalf of Gardner,
made a plÂ»-a for this testimony.
"There has been introduced an ele
ment," he said, "in the nature of a charge
that this was In some sense a ilxed-UD
affair."
"That came from the statement of the
petitioner." remarked Judge Jones. 1* 1
implicates not only the asylum manage
ment." continued Jones, "but a number of
other people."
"The only testimony of that kind Is that
of Buchanan." interrupted the court, add
ing "continue." and the testimony of
Klett was read.
Adjournment was then taken until Fri
day morning at 10 o'clock.
District Attorney Hell declares that his
admission that Much Huchanan inlÃlit
have been Insane at the time of his trial
does not signify that there may not have
been a conspiracy to find Huchanan 11 111 1 -
fane to save him from a criminal proHtcu
tion.
All the testimony thus far taken In the
habeas corpus hearing, he claims, goes to
show that there has been no change In
liuchanstn'B mental condition since h's
commitment to the asylum, and thai he is
pane at the present time. He holds that
if Hucnannn is sane now be was sane :it
the time the killing was done, and that
Â«lther the medical experts used exceed
ingly bud Judgment or there was a con
spiracy.
Dr. CJardnc-r is billed to take the stand
on Friday, and his examination Is ex
pected to be the most sensational of the
hearing. Other witnesses will also ap
pear from Bville. it was announced
in court to-day that the hearing would
takf at least two more days. During the
entire day Hugh Huchanan sat in court, a
close listener, and followed Intently every
word of the testimony. Owing to the
mental Rtrain of appearing on the stand
yesterday he got little, sleep last night,
liut no one In the room was more mentally
alert and wakeful than he. He feels con
fident that he will gain hi* point and be
turned over to the Yuba County authori
ties for trial for the killing of William 11.

BISHOP PEREIRA
UNDER ARREST
Criticized the Nicara
guan Congress-
â¦â
CorrrÂ«pon<lence of the Associate] Press.
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 6.âPresi
dent Zelaya on November - caused the ar
rest of Roman Catholic Bishop Pereira
of Nicaragua at the episcopal residence
at Leon and had him brought under sur
veillance to Managua. This action Is said
to be in consequence of severe criticism
of the Bishop's recently published pas
toral letter on the law passed by Con
gross October 14, declaring that all dona
tions of the people of lands, cattle, etc.,
; to the church should be subjected to civil
; government and should be sold and ap
plied to th* purposes designated by the
donors by the municipal governments In
stead of as previously by the hierarchy
of the church.
It Is currently reported that Hlshop
Pereira has refused to retract his declara
tions, that be was sent under guard to
Granada yesterday, there to be placed on
board the lake steamer bound for the port
or Ban Juan del Bur. from which place, it
is added, he will be sent out of Nicara
gua on a steamer bound for South Amer
ica. This route, it Is explained, has been
selected in preference to the more direct
route for Corinto, in order to prevent a
possible uprising of the people in the de
pertinent* of Leon and Chtneengu who
are strong Roman Catholics and devoted
to the Bishop, whereas the people of the
departments of Managua and Granada
still retain their old jealousy against Leon
and It.- people and exhibit much feeling
because a native of Leon was appointed
Bishop of Nicaragua Instead of some
priest of Managua or Granada.

gold and silver at the present legal ratio, and
who are. opposed to the policy of extending the
1 gold standard in the I'nltetl State* by retir
ing Greenbacks, destroying the full money
power of the existing silver dollar, providing;
for the payment of all Government obligations
and the redemption of all forms of paper
money in gold alone and s\>rrenderlng to v

Mr. McAdle has no great faith In the per

that dainty finery should be dotted after

LOUIS DREXLER'S ESTATE.
Appraisers Find That His Property
Is Worth About Two Millions.
The inventory and appraisement of the
estate of the late Louis Drexler was filed
In the office of the County Clerk. By the
filing of the inventory the popular belief
that the deceased was ten times a million
aire has been dispelled. Alexander Me-
Callum. Harry H. Dana and Lincoln Sonn
tag, tht appraisers, found the estate to be
worth J1.526.149 30. The largest Items on
the inventory follow: Cash. $15,619 37.
stocks and real property, $442,334 66. A
large portion of the estate consists of se
cured notes, among them being six given
by .Mr.Â«. Florence Blythe Hinckley. dated
January 29. IK9?. two payable to John 11.
Dickinson, one to Cecelia A. Levy and one
to Ida J. Phillips, who assigned them to
Drexler. One note given by W. H. H.
Hart Is for >60.000, but Interest has
greatly advanced Its value. The deceased
held stocks and bonds in a majority of the
quasi-public corporation/, the property
going to make up the total being extreme
ly mixed and varied In value. .â¢
In concluding their report th*Â» executors
say that they have been unable to ascer
tain with exactness from Mrs. Drexler
how much of the estate is community
properly, but are Informed that the bulk
thereof was the separate property of the
deceased.

Tommy Burns, the snappy lightweight,
incurred the displeasure of the stand at
Oakland yesterday, and for the next ten
days can sing songs, whittle, play the
races or anything he chooses but ride
Tommy had the mount on Duckoy, favor
ite for the two-year-old sprint, fourth to
be decided. The big colt was headed from
the start by Walter Jennings' entry, An-
Jou, but this fact was not the cause of the
Jockey's trouble. With second place
cinched. Burns grew frolicsome, eased up
nil mount and was beaten a head by the
fast-coming filly The Lady, piloted by
Ylttltoe. After being censured for his
carelessness by the Judges Hums was set
down for ten days.
The track was very heavy, and outsid
erÃ In the betting cut up their usual
pranks on two different occasions. Miss
Madeline scored by a nose, backed from
10 to â¢, and Mocorito in the last was first
to reach the wire, with 12 to 1 against her
in the ring. Magdalenas, Jerla and Los
Uedanos were the successful choices.
The prettiest finish of the afternoon
took place between Los Medanos, ridden
by Jack Martin, and Satsuma, with Eddie
Jones in the saddle, at the termination
of the mile and a sixteenth run. The
Baldwin horse made the running, followed
Into the stretch by Batauma and Dr.
Sheppard. Jones now shook Satsuma up
nd at the paddock he looked to have the
race won. Martin, however, must have
had a kink In reserve, for, giving Medanos
an additional kick or two, he again pas.- cd
the bald-face horse, getting the cieclson
by a head. The little fellow was heartily
applauded for his splendid effort.
Flying Magdalenas seemed to be In more
than ordinary fettle, downing a big field
in the opening live furlong dash very clev
erly. Backed from twos to 8 to 5. she
shook off Lady Helolse, winning by two
lengths from Alaska, a 12 to 1 chance.
Little Ranch on Miss Madeline, a racy
looking filly, captured the event follow
ing, a jaunt over the Futurity course.
Giro led up to within ten yards of the
wire, where the outsider collared and beat
the Burke entry a nr>se. The favorite,
Aborigine, with Burns up. finished third.

DIAMOND
STARS WILL
PLAY BALL
Western Champions and All-
Californias in Their
Initial Game.
The winter series of baseball games will
begin this afternoon at Recreation Park
with a game between the high salaried
cracks of Eastern diamonds and the
champions of the California League from
Sacramento. The .ill-star aggregation li
composed of men whose names and faces
are familiar to local lovers of the game.
Their performances in the East have been
watched with keen interest by their local
admirers, who have taken pride In their
work, because It was here that they made
their debut In their profession. Conspicu
ous among them Is Jay Hughes, the top
notch twlrler of the Brooklyn Club. To
Hughes more than any other man in that
team Is due the credit for winning the
1 championship of the National league, and
he is acknowledged to-day to be the most
expert twirler in the businr sa. The other
members of the aggregation are seasoned
ball toâ era, and they are capable nf giv
ing any team in the country a hard bat
tle. Yet the- arimirÂ«>rÂ» of the Hacramento
team are ho enthusiastic over the work
of the champions that they are confident
of their ability to cope with thÂ»j NatloriHl
League stars. They are anxious to nvr
Hughes opposed to Harvey In the box and
their wishes are to bo gratified, for In
one of the time games those two twlrl^rs
will official. The outcome of the contest
will be watched with a great Â«lÂ«>al of in
terest not only In this city, but also in
the East, for Harvey has been drafted
by Chicago for next season, and the Na
tional League magnates are anxious to
know what he Is capable of doing. Th*
games will surely be spirited affairs, and
a large attendance Is expected.
The line-up for to-day's contest Is as

bery. The men w*rÂ«* detected by John D.
O'Brlcn. who Informed the officer before
the mi n could escape, and the arrest fol
lowed.
Yesterday morning two men who after
ward proved to lie Joe Riordan and Frank
E. Crafton, both ex-convicts, met Carlo
D. Bernardo, who resides at the California
Hotel, at 210 Montgomery avenue, on
Kearny street, near Sacramento. They
walked him as far as California street
and then commenced a systematic search
of his pockets. While they were engaged
in the daring operation, almost Immedi
ately under tne glare of an electric lamp.
O'Brien stepped irom the CaUfornla~street
police station and walked toward Kearny
street. He recognized the drunk as one
he saw at the same corner a short time
I before and witnessed the men In the act
of attempting to rob him. O'Brien walked
toward tne group, and was hot discovered
until he was almost upon them. Both the
crooks then released their victim and in
a familiar tone bid him adieu. O'Brien
then a*k.-d the trunk it he was acquainted
with his companions. The drunk replied
that he was not. and that the men hud
just gone through his pockets, whereupon
O'Brien called Officer Conway and ap-
Erised him of the facts. The pair of tod
ers cn.ssed California street, and had
just started down the side opposite the
police station when the officer was upon
them. Bernardo then confronted them
and accused them of having attempted to
rub him. in the presence, of several officers
and witnesses.
Both men were taken into the station,
and Kiordan made a desperate attempt to
escape. He was first followed by O'Brien.
Officer James Connolly then Joined In the
chase, and after a long run caught the
Â«-seapÂ»-d prisoner. Riordan struck Con
nolly several severe blows with his heavy
umbrella before he could be handcuffed.
When the crook returned to the station he
gave two names, Joseph Smith and David
Kllngenfess. and his companion claimed to
be a physician who recently arrived from
Chicago". Both â¢.â â â¢â¢ locked up.
To-day the detectives found that both
of the- men were ex-convlcts*and daring
criminals. The man who made an attempt
to free himself from the clutches of the
law is Joe Riordan. who has served two
terms, one for burglary and another for
robbery, besides having been convicted
many times since he was 11 years old of
j mlno'r often â Crafton. Instead of being
a Chicago physician. Is a Fresno forger,
who spent some time in San Quentin.
The cases were called In Judge Mogan's
court yesterday morning, but, owing to
the inability of Bernardo to positively
identify the men. he being badly intoxl
cateel when the affair happened, and the
absence of other witnesses, the case was
postponed until Saturday morning.
The police think that the men are re
sponsible for a large number of the crimes
and holdups which have recently been
committed, and pronounce them bad char
acters. They feel confident of connecting
them with other cases.

CONCEALING THE STATE RECORDS

C-I;OR some reasonâ or possibly from a sheer lack
j of reasonâ Governor Gage has endeavored to
prevent the press from obtaining information
concerning the proceedings of the btatc government
and other oiTscxal matters which should be of public
record. As \va< pointed out yesterday, The Call on-
Saturday published from its correspondent in Santa
Cniz the Inter of resignation of Dr. F. W. Bliss as a
member of the State Hoard of Dental Examiners,
ljut up to yesterday our Sacramento correspondent
had been able to find no record of it open to news-
K-t.iercrs. Information has also been received from
an authoritative source that Dr. G. S. Bachman,
president of the board, and Dr. W. A. Moore, the
secretary, have resided, but here again the records
in the Ciovensnr s ottjee do not show the facts nor
would the attaches oi the oince give mtormation in
regard to them.

The police have arrived at conclusion that a
local degenerate who choked the life out of a woman
is a strangler. It is quite possible that they, may
supplement their opinion with the discovery that the
Chicago ministers have communed with them
selves and have bitterly denounced Thanksgiving
football as a desecration. Somebody in Chicago
must have stumbled across a forgotten copy of the
blue laws.
The dispatches declare that Cecil Rhodes is pre

OUR THANKSGIVING DAY.
WITH each succeeding year the people of the
United States, and chiefly those of California,
find in their conditions some special reason ior
: observing with genuine gratitude and sincere joy the
annual festival of Thanksgiving. It was so even in
the years of financial panic, industrial depression and
of drought, and in this year of prosperity such
reasons are to be found on every side, in every line
of industry, in all sections of the State and in almost
every household.
At the present time the prosperity of California de
pends mainly upon the rural industries of her people,
for as yet she is an agricultural rather than a manu
j factoring or commercial community. It i? to the ,
i farms, therefore, we have to look for the basis of our J
I material good, nor will we look in vain. Statistics j
compiled by the California Fruit-grower in its annual j
review of the harvests of the State abundantly show !
; forth the flourishing condition of our farms, orchards,
vineyards, hoptields and pastures. The shipments of
Caliiorma fnut. vegetable and vine products for the
calendar year iBgS were 8078 ten-ton carloads in ex- j
cess of those of the previous year, and while the ship- j
ments of this year cannot be exactly estimated, yet
j it is certain they will far exceed those of last year.
j In fact, the fresh fruit shipments which were made
j up to October 31 show in increase over those of the I
corresponding period of last year of 1344 carloads, 1
making a total up to that date of 6464 carloads and j
j giving reason to believe that by the end of the year
the fresh deciduous fruit shipments alone will amount i
to about 8000 carloads.
When to these shipments are added those of citrus
fruits, of dried and canned fruits and raisins and nuts
and wine, it will be seen that the grand total will be
something of marvelous richness. Last year the
i shipments were 6078 cars of fresh fruit, 4-. cars of
: prunes. I^7o cars of dried fruits other than prunes. 1
j 40^2 cars of raisins. 2,602.322 cases of canned fruits
! nnd vegetables. 10.875 carloads of oranges and
! lemons, 610 carloads ot almonds and walnuts. 44.500
bales of hops and 3847 cars of fresh vegetables. To
.1 .. V 111 r r Â«
these must be added a sugar output of 36,180.000
! pounds, a wool clip of 25.c63.240 pounds, a wine and
i brandy production of 20,2^8.000 gallons and a gold
output of $15,637,000.
JmiNi were the shipment* ot 1808. the year of what
was known as a season of drought. When the sum
total of this year is made up the record will be suiti
â¢
cient to encourage even the least snn.TJine. am!,
moreover, it is to be remembered that with the abun
dant ram* that have fallen the prospect of the coming
year promises larger harvests still.
lhc enrct 01 these abundant harvests is seen in th: !
Â«â¢ â¢ â  v t . - â¢â â Â«â â â â  ...
strong condition ot the banks which carry on the
i* â¢ I â¢ â  â  â  r~
financial transactions of our people. In the last two
years the amounts in the banks due depositors have
increased by more than $50,000,000. showing that the
1 abundant revenues flowing into the State have
Iâ *.- - . , â¢ !
enable*! the farmers and others not only to pay off
large amounts of mortgages but to add to their sur
plus on deposit.
With all this material prosperity there hn.ve come
moral and intellectual benefits. The discontents and
class antagonisms of the bad years have vanished.
The people arc more harmonious nd united in the"
spirit of enterprise and true patriotism than ever be
fore. The time is clearly approaching when Caliior
nians will 'work together with as much zeal and har
mony as the dwellers in the older States, and when the
moÂ«t far-reaching movements tor the general good
can be undertaken with assurance of success.
The cause of higher education in the State has been
notably advanced during the year. The munificent
endowment of Stanford has been realized into a for
tune so vast as to make it the richest university in the
world. The State University has prospects even
brighter than Stanford, for. founded as it is upon
the wealth of the State and supported liberally by the
people, it is only a matter of time when, growing
with the growth of California, it will far surpass any
institution tounded upon a private fortune.
Thus in the pa*t year we have advanced from good
to better in all things which tend to the welfare of
man. \V< are not only richer than ever before, but
our aspirations arc -higher. Our horizon has widened
before us. A vaster commerce, a busier industry, a
higher culture, a truer patriotism than we have yet
known are our*. And before us even' prospect is
bright. Along the whole horizon there is no cloud
of gloom. Another year of prosperity awaits our
energy and our thrut. and we would be lacking in
deed in an appreciation of the blessings that are ours
if we failed to give thanks to-day in every form of
observance from charity to the poor and rejoicing
at home to that devout gratitude which is due to the
Almighty Giver of all good.

possibilities of wireless telegraphy as demonstrafed by
Signer Marconi, the skillful Italian electrician, have
not exceeded under the most favorable circumstances
fifty words an hour, or an extreme transmission of
275 vrcmfc in fire and a iraii hours. To pretend to
receive more than such a number is therefore an im
position." After giving what purported to be a re
view of Marconi's work by an expert it added: "In
view of these facts it is sheer faking -on the part of
any one to pretend to have received anything over
300 words in six hours by wireless telegraphy."

Now comes the official verification of all the claims
of The Call and the confirmation of the splendid tri

operation of the wireless telegraph during the yacht
race were a number of officers of the United States
navy, who have just made a report to Rear Admiral
Bradford. In the course of this report it is said a
stock quotation from Navesink Light to the Grand
Duchess containing 223 words was received in seven
minutes by the system of counting used on land lines.

received from the station at Navesink with facility
and accuracy, the estimated speed being about twelve
word:, per minute. There was a short hitch at one
in sending messages owing to the interrupting
device failing, which caused a delay of a minute or so.
It was^stated that over 2000 words were sent and over
300 received by Marconi during the day. Lieutenant

I An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
! effects of the trell known remedy,
! STBtT- of Figs, mannfactared br the
j California. Fig Steep Co.. illustrate
| the vain* of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the fona most refreshing- to the
tast* and acceptable to the system. It
is the one penect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually.
dispcilic{r colds headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enablfa $ one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and snb-
stance. ard its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figrs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
tast-. but the medicinal qualities of the
rtmedy are obtained from senna end
:>ther aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to g-et its beneacial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

swam colliers eighty-five hours. Of the !
fleet that got ir yesterday the steamer |
Progreso. â with 2"J30 tons ooal. was 1-H j
hours from Taccma. the schooners Sailor !
Boy was 22 days. Challenger 40 days, and !
bark Gatherer 20 days: the ships America I
ar.d Spartan were 2S and 22 days, resptct- !
lvely. from Seattle: the schooners Emma
Utter. Glen ar.d Twilight 23 days each
i from Grays Harbor, the schooner W b- c
i foot 20 days from Wll'.apa. the schooner
Albion 2S days from Coquille. the schcon
! er Falcon 21 days from Coos Bay and thÂ«
| schooner Uranus 13 days from Willapa.
Of the fleet that made port yesterday :
the Chaitenger was the one that fared \
worst during the grale. For nearly two
weeks she was either under bare poles or i
trying to hold her own under a . able- j
reefed mainsail. She ran short of provt-.
sions, and when the crew was down to a
diet of plain bear.s the Albion hove" in
sight and supplied her with enough bread. '
flour and meat to last ten days. She !
sprang aleak, ar.d night and day the men
bad to work tiu pumps In order to ke^p
the schooner Crczn becoming waterlogged. '
When the Challtr.ger reached port jreater- [
j day ------ at once put on the Mission |
', mud Cats.
The Challenger left Tacoma on October
20 with a load of lumber consigned to the i
Tacoma Mill Company. Almost from the j
moment Flattery was passed a hard time j
was experienced. Captain Anderson says '
I that the weather was nothing unusual far '
| this time of the year up to November & ;
: Then it blew a stiff gale, and gradually â 
; increased in force until November 12,
; when it blew a hurricane, accompanied by
: heavy rain squalls. Not a stitch of can
i vas could be carried on the vessel, ar.d
; she lay in the trough of the sea. the crew
! expecting every minute to see her roll her
; masts out. The hawsers and large ropes
; were got out and bight* put In them, after
which they were allowed to dnur over
i board, and thus helped to brinsr the veÂ«
! sels head up- to the wind. Oil bags Â»j*re
i put over th* b.>w. ar.i these prevented
; the seas from breaking aboard.
When the schooner was out twenty-one
! days the supply of provisions began to
| give out. and by November 13 there wa*
! nothing left in the larder but a supply of
bear.s. There was enough of these to last
a week, but everybody on the Challenzer !
was glad to s*-e the steamer Albion. She
gave thrm a good ten days" supply, ar.d '
every man on the scnoor.er has a good ,
wcrd to say for the captain of the steam- ;
er.
During the heavy weather of November :
12 the Challenger scrang a leak and ever ;
since the pumps nave been kept going ;
night and day. The men took turn aoout j
at the work ar.d managed to keep the
vessel from becoming waterlogged. She
now lies on the Mission mud flats and !
will discharge into lighters, after which ;
she will go en the drydock for a.n over
hauling.
Oft Coos Bay the Challenger righted the
schooner Enterprise with n*r deckload i
gonÂ«*. It had evidently gone by ho board
and took all the bulwarks alon^ with it-
A ship, a bark, a three-masted schooner â¢
! and a topmast schooner w*re also sighted, j
I all making heavy weather cf It. C3.r- '
i tain Anderson Is of the opinion that the '
i Ferris S. Thompson. Highland Light, ;
j American Girl and all the ft>*u overdue i
! on the Sound from San Fran<Msoo have ;
be*n carried north by the ~urr.-nt and !
will make their way tack as soon as me
wind changes.
The heroine of the storm is Mrs. Ltena
Neilsen. wife of the captain of the
schooner Glen, she went to Grays Har- i
bor by steamer to Join h<*r husband ai.J :
came home with him in the -schooner. At i
Grays Harbor the entire crew desert* d!
I the ship nnd Captain Neilsen had to Â«n- <
gage a new lot of men. He could not g^t ;
i cook, so Mrs. Neilsen offered to attend !
to the galley during the run home. The !
voyage lasted 2* days, and Mrs. Neilsen i
says she never wants to go to sea a^ain. !
In sptte of the heavy weather, she *iood i
to her post and cook?d the m^n's meal.i. j
however, and whenever they requested it !
there was always a pot of hot coffee on !
the stove.
"I ncv^r saw such weather." said Mr*. !
Sells yesterday. "At times Â»c cou!d
cot carry a stitch of canvas on the yea- i
sel and at other times it seemed as though j
we were all going to tne bottom sure. .
Once I zeaAs sure we were gone. A pin !
rail brok^ and let the lumber down. Th*n
I started to pack my trunk. Just as I
was puttir.z the last of my clothes in. It
struck me all of a heap what I was go
ing to do with thÂ» trunk. Then I rushed
on deck, determined to die in th? open |
air. but my husband told me to go back
into the Â«abin. faying the deck was no
place for me. I stayed down in that cabin
thinking every moment would be my laÂ«t.
You can imagine how thankful I was
when daylight came and I found the Gien J
I afloat and not damaged at aIL I am now
j preparing the last meal I will ever coot
i on a sailing vessel, and the next time I
; make & holiday trip with my husband I'll
choose another time of the year."
None of the vessels that reached port
yesterday showed any signs of the heavy
weather they came through. They all say
i that the toutbeaster was the heaviest and
t longest continued gale ever -en on the
: coast, but that outside of that fact there
j was nothing unusual to report.
The transports Columbia and Daln<*y
i Vostok will sail for Manila to-day with
i the Forty -second Regiment, and the War-
I ren will follow them on Saturday with
the Forty-ninth Infantry (colored). The
j Warren I? In -plendld shape to make the
; run to the Philippines. Srie has been thor
! oughly overhauled and a couple of defects
j that were found In her steering gear have
! been rectified. Chief Officer Ford E. Mi
i irulre has the transport In a" good con
j ditlon to-day as he had her on her rinÂ«t
voyage, and It Is safe to -ay that the
i Warren will come back to port looking as '
: clean and neat as she does on Inspection i
; day.
ThÂ« Warren's chief officer la one of the {
; best known and best liked master mari
ners on the coast. For six years he was ;
: captain of the Shir and Mercury and '
j for six years more he was master of the
; ship J. B. Brown. He left the latter yes
, sel to go second mate of the Warren, and
! about a year ago was made chief officer
He Is a most able assistant to Captain
; Hart, and bt- tween them they have helped
; to make the Warren one of the most pop
ular transport* In the service.
Captain Jepsen of the steamer Queen '
and Captain Wallace, superintendent oo f
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company !
are very indignant over a fake story that
appeared in a morning paper yesterday
In the Brat part of the article the Queen
run< on the â  -.-.-- and In the
latter part the story' Is denied. Captain
Jepsen says the Queen was mÂ»ver nÂ»Â»are
than a mile and a half to the arallones*
and the engineers say thai they never got
a "stop and back bell" until the * termer
was nearlng the wharf. Captain Wallace
says the story was made out of whole
cloth and the man who could and would
write such a cock MM bull story should
be In a lunatic asylum.

fact, they have adopted a resolution that
the board of directors or a majority there
of in each Incorporated bank In the State
shall U> required, in addition to any other
examination, to make a semi-annual ex
amination of the condition, at the close of
business on JanÂ« 3U and December 31 re
spectively, of each year, of the assets and
liabilities of the bank in which they are
directors, and shall, within ten days
thereafter, make, under oath, a report in
writing, to the Commissioner*, th^ir find-
Ing's and conclusions, upon bl.ir.ks to be
furnished by the Commissioners.
Heretofore the oQcers of the banks have
made the sole reports to the Commission
ers. The directors of some Calif ornia banks
that have been in deep water, have. j.":-r
the crash came, acknowledged that they
did not know the real facts. The more of
the Commissioners Is to put another safe
guard upon the funds deposited or invest
ed in banks, and the measure adopted
seems to be well calculated to make the
directors learn all that they can concern
ing their own banks. Within the past
fortnight every State bank has been noti
fied ar.d the directors have been notified
concerning what is required. In every
letter a copy cf the resolution has been
sent and al.-Â«o a form to be tilled out by
the bank directors and sworn to before a
notary public. Every item concerning the
assets or liabilities of a bank Is specified
with particularity. The form of oath
adopted for the directors Is as follows:
W> do ?ach of us. for hlmaelf aa.J not for
the othÂ«r. Mlctaaly Â«â¢**Â» r that we have pÂ»r
sonally Â»xamtn-M each Item of the ... i and

tne above . j.i---. Â« are true to thÂ« b*Â« of cur
*-â¢,Â»>'.?â¢ and belief.
There are twenty-three direct questions
to answer, which deal with the exact
status of the following: Bank premises,
other rÂ»Â»al estate, stocks, bonds, warrants,
mortgages., bills receivable, overdrafts,
money, checks, clearing house certificates,
ca*h tags, banks â current accounts, bankj
âloaned, furniture, expenses, taxes, and
other assets. On the liabilities side are
the following: Capital, surplus, commer
cial deposits, saving deposits. Interest
certificates, certified checks, banks â cur
rent accounts, banks â borrowed, city.
State or county money, interest collected,
exchange, rents, dividends unpaid, protit
and loss, rediscounts, and other liabilities.
ThÂ«>se are supposed to cover the condition
of a bank so thoroughly that the an?wÂ»rs
will tell the Commissioners what they
wish to know^

in the old play this scene la treated with
all seriomr.es* ar.d the shrew sobeny
calls the sun the moon. Just a- she has
yielded other disputed points to her ar
bitrary mate. Shakespeare knew better
than to compel Kate to contradict the
evidence of her own senses, except In a
sort of merry Irony. This is the fasnton
in which the earlier dramatist does it:

it sun or moon. Scch little touches re-il

meaning, and show what rr.'.z'r.: be mad*
of the comedy if it were rendered anjht
instead of bring degraded, obscured and
caricatured, as it ;ren*rally has fceeo on
th* stage. The performance of. ihe p!.ay
by Mr. Daly's company was a markej
Improvement on the usual misrepresenta
tion, though the personation of tha :.-ti
and heroine did not seem to me to brins
out certain of the more uubtle features
of Shakespeare's characterization.
â¢ The last scene, where Kate wins thÂ»
wajer for her husband by hÂ»r prompt
and unquestionable obedience must be in
terpreted in the liffht of what has pre
ceded: and when Lucentio and Hort^".*lo
express their surprise and wonder Afcat

m*ttt. r<*aee it b**!**. and It*-* aad <;slet life.

And. to b* short, what cct that's ?wÂ»et and
hÂ»pvr *
, The p*ace and love and all that v
i sweet and happy are put first and last.
j and the obedience is mentioned orty In a
i secondary and subordinate way, as if to
> suggest chat it was based â¢.;â¢â¢ n the love
i and not upon masculine lordship.
When Kate pu'ils off her cap and treads
i it under foot It I* because rhÂ« und*r
! stands her husband's purposeâ as In tne
; eaÂ»<? of the sun and the moon. When sh-j
is sent out t<> fetch the other wive* she LÂ»
bright enough to suspect that some trial
! of their conjugal obedience !s going en.
| and she at once enters into It with hearty
I enjoyment. In the long spÂ«^ch tha: fo!-
IowÂ» Shakespeare has avoided ail the ab
surdity of the -corresponding part of taa
old play, which is a pedantic homily on
the creation of the world and of man. I
I give It here as another specimen of the
j material which Shakespeare worked upon
and which some critics strangely assume
to be from his own pen at an earlier
period In hi* dramatic career:

In what Shakespeare makes Kate say
there is little that should offend our mod
ern taste. Obedience Is not made thÂ«
whole duty of the wife, nor Is too much
stress laid upon the husband'a authority
The tribcte due him Is said to be "love"
fair tool and true obedience"â "too lit
tle payment for the debt she owÂ»s" to his
I loving care and labor for her comiort and
welfare. If the husband is represented as
sovereign he is also servant, and the sov
ereisr.ty la based upon the affectionate
and devoted service, not upon thÂ» im
1 posed superiority of sex. r
It should bÂ« said h*re that Shake
speare's part of this scene probably endj
with thÂ« line. "That iÂ«Â«c!cs to bÂ« most
wh!eh we Indeed Jeast are." The rhym*
and the Alexandrine Indicate that h*
meant to have the scene end there: but
tr.e manager of the theater, or whoever
finished up the p!ay for the stas*. ad'!e<l
the btt from the oM comedy about pl.ic-
Injr the wtfe's hands below the husband*
foot. It will be se#r. that the eariler p:ay
wrtjrht adds the stnÂ«e direction "She Ut*s
her hand under h-r husband's fe*t*." #
Shakespeare would never have carried tha
thin? out In that literal way. even If â¢
had retained â  â words as a Cffuratlva
expression.
There Is no "sr>eci*l plÂ»ndinjr" In what I
have said of Shakespeare's moderation cf
the spirit and tone of the earl!er play, f-
noth;r.Â« of the sort was necessary. All
the chances he made were In this direc
tion, and I have referred to only a few a*
Illustrations. To quote and comment upca
all would far exceed the space at my curv.

Italy in Shakespeare's Plays.
England and Italy arÂ» pr*-Â«siir.ent!y ths
countries of Shakespeare's play*. Tha
scene* of fourteen of thÂ»ci 'including thÂ«
historical playi> are laid wholly or partly
In Enelar.d. and of eleven tincludlnit tha
Roman plays* wholly or partly ta Italy.
I count "The Tempest."' arson* the latter
because the character* are Italian thouxhj
the scer.e is laKl on an Ulasd not dÂ«f
Â«<rrtbÂ»d in any prosaic mant:al of reÂ«Â»
raphy. Th* other playsâ twelve In a!!â are
scattered through various landsâ Greece,
Illyria. Bohemia. Fnr.ce. Sicily. Der.inarie.
etc. Some of these are mere names. ThÂ«
Illrria of "Twelfth Nla-ht" and the F->
hemla of "The Winter's Tale." for In
stance, mlffht be anywhere else. In tha
poet* day the theater had little or no
painted scenery, ar.d a sljjn or placard
wa.i often put u^ at the back of the sta<Â«
to Indicate the localityâ Athens. Rome,
Venice or whatever it mi* ht bÂ«. The
Â§ism waa the only aid to the spectator*
trr.arinatico. which had to furnish a local
habitation for the came as best It eouM.
And so with the Messina of "Much Ado "
the Ephesus of "The Comedy of Errors'
and the llk*Â». They are nothing more
than r.acfÂ« *tnck on a sta*e without
scenery. Transpose these name* from
orÂ» play to another and it would make bo
difference except la the measure of a tenr
lire* In which the names occur.
But the Italian scenes are veritably
Italian. In "The Two Gentlemen of Ve
rona." indeed, this local ton* l.Â« not -o
marked, but that play Is one of the earli
est that Shakespeare wrot". an 1 It Li evi
dent that he was not then so much at
home In Italy a- when he wrote the later
play* of which that country is the Â»cer.*Â»
Did he ever visit Italy? It Is not Im
possible, thoujrh it serms to me on t>Â«
whole tmtrobable. 'hat he may hare done
so Critics who have been tn Italy. an<i
some who have Ion? re*Med there, find I*

Mr. C. A. Brown, who lived for yean In

EASTERN MARKETS
Hew York Stock Market.
mm . -rrlces of stocks were
on the wholo well sustained to-day. In spite
of some factor* mnk!r.g for reaction. Chief of |
these was the continued hardness of the money j
market, the further slump in leather and the
movement to take pniflts in the Trunk Line \
su-cks, whtih have ailvanced so aggressively
for Â»ome time past. This protll-taklr.g mov.- |
nÂ»ent was the nearest to official confirmation I
mat oould be had of the numerous published
reports and rumors of a consolidation of con
trol of the rrÂ«u trunk lines. Those favored
with advance information of such a project
would naturally be seller* when the news be
came public property and brought in outside !
â¢ Â» A goÂ»d proportion of to-days outside 1
buyers thus Invited operated by cable orders !
Irom London.. Americans shared in the gen-raj |
etrencsh In the market ..ri account of reports of
British military successes armnst the Uoer*. I
London, buying Â»jj a\*r> attracted by the publi- I
cation c: the currency reform measure to be
Eusneu by the dominant party at the coming
pension of CongrekS. This was the mainttav of !
the market, and the strength displayed here
nnd there by individual stn.ks. many of th-m '
ol**cure. Kept the market nrm In fare Âf the un- ;
easlnors over the money outlo- k. To-morrow's
n..llilor also prompted some closing up of t.hurt '
accounts. While London's buying Â«Â«Â« the majn !
sustaining factor, the further hardening In the
J^-.nj..n money rate and fears of an advance in I
the Hajik of England rate to-morrow, diucour- '
ared oteratlon*> for the long accr.unt. The i
Cervar.d for money kept the rate at : per cent j
and above until it had be.-n mostly sntlsfW.
when It feil below 4 :*r cent in the late deal- I
lngÂ«. and the stock market hardened in r-- i
ep.nse. ThtÂ» âºÃ¼b-TrraÂ«nry's disburr.-m.-nts on I
account of bond redemptions were considerably i
below f'.000.000. and the Trea>-ury statement
frrm vinshin-ton showed th.- day's revenue
receipts nearly $L7tf'.<A' in excess of expendl- '
tures. As this is the last day for which the j
Treasury Department's offer t^ tedeem bonds ,
holds good, the total disbursements tor redemp- !
tion are but little over half the amount <,f the !
total offered. The feeling is general In Wall :
ftrect. however, that the i>erl">d of the offer j
will be extended and a safety-valve against '
pressure of money rates thus supplied.
A further decline In New York exchange at ,
Ch!cac> to It cents discount n,,.i.:.-; ;o conts
yesterday and a downward movement in New
Y->rk exchange at other domestic centers were
again the nppoattlon that New York is Raining
this weÂ»>k on the Interior currency movement
as -â â â â¢ last week. Fractional ft gain*
are the rule in stock* and they rlac to a point
or over in only a few excej-ti.inal casos. The i
bond market was quiet and prices showed tome
Improvement hs the day progressed Total ,
sales, par value. J1.J3.-..000. fnlted States thre* s I

CHICAGO. Nov. 29.â The break In Liverpool,
despite the strength developed here yesterday,
was the prime factor In the local market at the
opening. As traders had looked for a rallying
influence In cables, the Wheiit taken In yester
day woi disposed of early. May opened VÂ»'<iS':
lower at 705?7QVaC. and December was ft a Ilka
fraction at t"j*hi.iiCVV*. Buying against puts,
together with purchases made on the strength
of H-riit Northwestern receipts, caused a rally-
Ing at the opening. May touching 70Vic and De
cember 6Cc. This advantage was loÂ«t. how
ever, as the caah and export demand was poor.
The market became heavy/ and May closed
â¢AfcSc down at C3Â»ic, and December SC%c off
at r.:.V.'''-'V'. As to-morrow Is a holiday, this
was the lant day of December as a future, and
much trading was done in evening up another
preparation for delivery. The difference be
tween May and December narrowed to 4\ie, but
was 4Ut?4Ho at the cloi-e. December deliveries
are expected to be heavy before the 10th.
Corn v.as steady early, with the December
liquidation apparently atciut completed. The
elavator* wen- ready to take all the December
oiltiincb.
May cloeÂ»d a shade down at 22Hc; December

Boston Wool Market.
I â¦â *
BOSTON. Nov. 29.â The American Wool and
Cotton Re porter will say to-morrow: [
There Is no abntement In the easement pre- j
viously noted in the wool market. If any- j
thinK It Is more Intensified. There Is a scarcity j
Of domestic wool facing the members of the '
j trade and manufacturer* and there la quite I
j v s. rambling among the former to secure th<? j
I desirable lots that remain. Many local houses
are entirely out of wool and are compelled to
go Into the opMI market again and again In
order to meet the requirements of their busi- |
ness. Many manufacturers are beginning to i
realise hN.> that they are none too heavily '
stocked and they are ready purchasers of wool j
when It is offered to them at anything like a
reasonable price. The foreign markets are j
. as excited and strong as they are her* and |
the London sales opened on Tuesday of this ;
uÂ»Â«>k at an advance of 13 per cent all around. !
with only 106.00J bales available and active !
; competition.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted
to ia.41J.000 pounds domestic and 502.000 pounds !
foreign, making a total of 15.915.000 pounds, â¢
j against â  total of 13.743.000 pounds for the pre- ;
, vlous week and a total of 3.339.5C0 pounds for ;
! the corresponding week last year. Sales since !
January l. 1*99, amount to 327.952.f.7S pounds. '

birds. Thin poor stock was hold at anything
It would hrihgâisay at ISOttc, and Â»** freely
offered to |*-.lilWs at these figures. The mar

keys than for several years. Live Turkeys
were neglected, as usual the day before
Thanksgiving, and there was no demand for

her estate to a Catholic church, and the

succeeded In breaking the will. But the
matter did not end there, for when the
sr.n was about to dlspore of â¢ part of thÂ«
property located on Seventh strett. near
Washington, for something; 111 SSO-X) the
point was raised that the property be
lonjjed to the estate of Curtis" father and
not to the mother. Judge Greene at the
time denied a petition to sell the property
until the real ownership could be deter
mined.
About this time the then Public Admin
istrator. James Stanley, undertook to set
tle up the estate, and it is said he found
It necessary to expend considerable of his
own money In administering It. Since
then several sets of appraisers have been
appointed, and discharged and last March
Stanley, on petition, was authorized to
pell property of the estate on Railroad
avenue, near I'nion Ftroet, to defray ex
pensos aggregating $3133 24. of which
f\2si 43 was for repairs, water bills, etc.;
J642 for expense of last Illness, burial, etc.
Moreover, the administrator recited that
there would be about $.".'5 60 additional
future expense.
In June the property was sold, and last
month Curtis hail Stanley cited to compel
him to render linal account. Stanley. In

there has been â  battle-royal ever sine-*

HOW ENGINEER
JOHN McCAULEY
SAVED A TRAIN
Storm Had Blown a
Car on the Trestle.
ALAMFDA, Nov. 29. -John McCanlÂ«7,
an engliuÂ«r on ih. Alaâ da ir
local train, saved a tralnload of p '
gors fri-m balnf "ii th-
troÂ«tie near the end of the narrow; .
â¢ mldnltlit laai 1 Igrht Bj
est viÃiiaricf an!
engineer prevented arbat M
one of the BTeati M (.â¢â rrurs In
for a train would bare been v\ :
tho water.
During the heavy storm of wind and
rain shortly before midnight la-t night a
section car was blown off .1 switch at
the depot at the end of the narrow gauge
trestle, and out upon the Alamcda m.iln
line. The car was .1 specially constructed
affair, with I heavy scaffolding built i â . : u 1 1
Into the air, m that palm might work
upon the roof of the ferry building. This
scaffolding caught the full force of lbÂ«
wind and acted Ilk*: sails upon a boat,
carrying the car out upon the main line.
Tins was not noticed by u ny Â«.f th<: â  m
plo)es at the depot)
stood out on the tr'.stl^ m menace to hun
dreds of lives.
The last train from Alameda toward
San Francisco last night was In charge
of John McCauley. and the engineer was
trying to make good time and reach the
depot at the end of the pier so that the
boats might not be held. He had maJe
his run through Alameda without inci
dent, and as he began the long run down
the Alameda till and trestle he opened thÂ«?
throttle and gave his engine almost full
head of steam for the run down.
The wind was blowing hard and the ra:n
was driving into the cab, but the engi
neer kept v eharp lookout ahead. die
night was dark and the storm made it
doubly black outside, and McCuuley
peered out into the night as the train Hew
over the rails.
Suddenly a dark object loomed out of
the darkness ahead, and McCauley saw
that something was on the track. For un
instant he was paralysed with fear, but
It was only an Instant. Instead of Jump
ing from his engine and letting his train
take care of Itself, he stuck to his post
and paved his train.
Throwing the reversing lever back he
crowded all steam on. at the pame time
sanding the rail" to mnko the wheels hold
more firmly. This threw the passengers
In the coaches from their prats and piled
them up in confusion in the aisles, but
McCauley wanted to stop the train before
It was thrown Into the water under the
trestle. Even with all his efforts the
train struck ihe car with sufficient force
to completely demolish the car and break
nil the light upper works on the enylne.
But MeCauley had saved his train.
"There Is nothing to tell." said Mc-
Cauley modestly. "I threw the engine
over and hung on, and did what any
other man would have donÂ» had he Oc-en
where I was. I didn't want to ditch the
train at that point.*'
WILL GET A DIVORCE
AS A NEW YEAR'S GIFT
OAKLAND, Nov. 29.â A decree of di
vorce on the ground of extreme cruelty
and a husband's Infidelity will be one of
the new year's gifts that Mrs. Isabella
Turnbul! Lain* will receive. Such at
least was the assurance Superior Judge
Greene gave the fair plaintiff this after
noon when her sensational divorce suit
against Peter Miller Lalng came up for
argument.
The attorneys, not at all prone to argue
the salacious details of the wife's com
plaint, wherein her own slater, Jemima
rurnbull. la named as corespondent, or
the husband's cross-complaint naming
one Robert Hill .1 - corespondent, an
nounced that the only subject worthy of
debato was that of a division of the prop
erty and they desired that a receiver be
appointed to sell the same, the proceeds
to be apportioned as the court might deem
equitable.
Judge Greene promptly appointed J. n.
Lanktree as receiver and In addition an
nounced that he would withhold entry
of the decree, which should be In favor
of the plaintiff on all grounds she alleged,
until January 2, 1900. at which time no
doubt the receiver would be ready in
court with his report.
Th- divorce suit of Emma Ketchum
against G. 11. Ketchum was to-day re
ferred by Superior Judge Greene to Court
Commissioner Babcock for the purpose
of taking the testimony in the case.

M'DONALD APPEARS
FOR HIS FATHER
TESTIFIES IN THE PACIFIC
BANK CASE.
A Contention Made by Opposing
Counsel Results in His With
drawal From the Wit
ness Stand.
R. 11. McDonald Jr.. looking careworn
and worried, was a witness before Judge
Murasky yesterday in the action Insti
tuted by his father. IV H. McDonald, to
recover $29,100 M, one-third of a sum ul
leKcd to have been loaned to the defunct
Pacific Bank. ThÂ« witness was called up
on to identify certain vouchers, alleged
receipts for the money advanced by the
plaintiff to the bank, but the contention
of the defendant's attorneys that the
vouchers simply showed a transfer of
money from the People*! Home to the Pa
cific Dank, for the purpose of showing a
credit, resulted In the withdrawal of Mc-
Donald from the stand until a future
date. The plaintiff then sought to put
banking expert! on the stand to prove
that the vouchers were as claimed. Ai::iln
argument resulted, and finally Judge Mu
rasky said that It devolved upon the court
to determine the nature of the Instru
ments from facU\evolved during the trial,
and that the testimony of experts .vould
not assist him. A continuance was then
taken.

ASSAILED A PRISONER,
Wesson Wandy Almost Adds Murder
to Other Wrongdoings.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. Wesaon Wandy,
the prisoner who was painfully scalded by
pulling down a steam pipe in the County
Jail, came near adding murder to the list
of his crimes to-day. This was the day
of his release, and he took advantage of
It to knock down young Anton Jason, the
Tomalea boy charged with criminal as
sault, with the brass-tipped end of a gar
den hose and then trying to force water
down his nostrils, with the intention of
asphyxiating the lad.
The boy's muffled cries drew Deputy
Sheriff Lucas to the scene. He tore Wan
dy away from his Intended victim and
locked him in a cell. Though the boy'a
head was badly cut his injuries were not
serious, and accordingly Wamlv was re
leaped and given a ticket to San Fran
cisco. The authorities are glad to get rid
of Wandy, as they look on him as a hoo
doo.

YOUNG MRS. WESTERFELDT RELATES
THE WOES OF A HASTY MARRIAGE
FACES AND FIGURES IN A MINOR DOMESTIC DRAMA.
ADDITIONS to the local colony of rubbernecks were
made by the dozen yesterday in Police Judge Mo
gan's court. The prettiest girl that had passed Its
portals In many months Wai the moving cause.
Ten months ago she was Oroveda Raymond, single and
just sixteen, when she ran away with twenty-year-old
Herman Westerfeldt and got married. Five times in as
many succeeding months she deserted his bed and the
board she pays he promised, but never provided, and five
times she went back because she loved him. Two months
later she deserted again never to return. Only last week,
she says, he threatened to kill her and her appearance
in court was In the role of prosecuting witness against
him on that charge.
According to the story of the bride Westerfeldt was
a poor provider, giving her but little more than love
upon which to live during their many times interrupted
married love. Considering the airiness of that diet the
young woman presented a decidedly healthy appearance
as she sat in court beneath a fetching red hat, awaiting
the calling of her case. She was supported on either side
by young gentlemen who had witnessed the last meeting
between herself and Westcrfeldt, out of which had grown
the prosecution. The defendant, a tall, pale young fel
low with a bang, sat to the left of his attorney, who
was flanked on the left by Paul de Bauge, accused of
being a st rangier of women.
The bride was her own tlrst witness. She said she
would be seventeen next February; that the had been
married ten months, had deserted the defendant six
times in the lirst seven moons of that period; that she
didn't want to live with him any more, and that she.
had instructed her attorney to sue Westerfeldt for di
vorce. In answer to questions from the court she de
scribed the meeting at which she said Westerfeldi had
threatened her. It occurred at noon one day last week
on Market street.*
"He grabbed me by the wrist." Fhe said, "and dragged
me up the street. I screamed and he told me to be care
ful, to consider what I was doingâ I didn't go with him
I would be sorry."

"Did he ever threaten to kill you?" asked the court.
"A number of times," replied the young wife, "he said
he would turn the gas on me. Once he did turn it on.
but he turned it riff again on my promise to get some
money. I went to the City Hall and got $2 trom the
.Mayors fund and gave It to him."
"You mean the Robinson bequest fund." paid his
Honor.
"Yes, sir," replied the witness. "Many other times h"
threat, ned to kill me and threw combs and bru-'
me "
"Did you ever see him have any deadly weapon, a
revolver, or â or a cigarette "
"Not that I know of," was the reply.
Mr- Westerfeldt said that in all her married life her
husband had never contributed, all told, more than $2 to
the maintenance of the menage and she bad been com
pelled to sing in the Tlvoli chorus in order to keep the
table going.
I'ivid 1.. Rosenberg, lr.te of Indlnna. a second cousin
of Mrs. Westerfeldt, was with her when the threat was
alleged to have been made.
"Westerfeldt told me," said Rosenberg, "to keep my
f.-i. .â  out of itâ it was none of my affair. He made a
break to hit me. When he left Mrs. Westerfeldt he said
to her. Til be DP to your mother's this evening at 7:30
nnd I'll be properly armed for whatever may occur.' "
"< Â»h, I tee," said the court, "he was preparing to call
on his mother-in-law'"
Frank de Man .I). mi told substantially the same story
as Rosenberg.
The defendant admitted the meeting, but denied the
threats. He said lie had merely wanted to tell the girl
if she wanted a divorce she could get it and if she didn't
gel It he would. He denied having turned on the p;m
to shorten Mrs. Westerfeldt's troubled marital career
and wa-s positive he had never been SO ungallant as to
shy a hair hru-h at her. On the contrary, he asserted,
his ability as a side-stepper had saved his pate from the
impact of a perfunv- bottle thrown by the bride.
Tho court will decide the case Monday next.

hope of covering up the crime.
McDonnell was visited by his sister-in
law yesterday forenoon at the Marine
Hospital. She endt-avored to R.-t him to
further particulars of the assault,
but he refused to do bo. and stated that
he had no d<sire for the authorities to
<!â¢ nl with the man who had stabbed him.
He Intlmat-'l that when he got well he
would attend to the punishment hims. If.
He refused to say whether Powers was
the man or not. Mrs McDonnell Insists
that the story he told her, as published
exclusively in The Call yesterday morn
lng. was exactly as her hrother-in-law
had told it to her. Investigations made
by the police bear out the story.
The wounded man is Flowlv recovering
and Is now practically out of danger. It
is expected that he will he able to leave
the hospital by the end of the week.
When first >> â it by a Call reporter.
Powers pretended ignorance of the at
tempted murder of McDonnell, and even
denied that he was acquainted with him.
He afterward admitted that he had work
ed with the wounded man's brother and^
knew McDonnell for about twenty years.
As his statements were anything "but sat
isfactory. Detective Gibson was notified
and he at once sought an Interview with
Powers. He readily consented to answer
the questions of the detective, but fre
quently Stopped to proclaim his inno
cence of any connection with the crime.
Gibson will continue his Investigation to
day and is hopeful of apprehending the
murderous assailant of McDonnell.

MORE NAMES ARE
MENTIONED FOR
MAYOR'S FAVORS
Health Board Under
Discussion.
â â¦ â
DRS. BAZET AND WILLIAMSON
â¦
LACKMANNS PATRONAGE GOES
TO THE PARTY.
It is said upon excellent authority that
Dr. Louis Basel and Dr. J. M. William
son Will bo the first choice of Mayor I'h'
lan for the incoming Board of Hcaltn,
and it Is further eald that the Mayor will
be guided largely by their advice in mak
ing subsequent appointments to that body.
Both the physicians named have served
upon previous boards and both have na
tional reputations. The news of their
probable appointment is being well re
ceived by their medical colleagues.
Whether or not Dr. Basel will accept
the proffered ofllce is another question.
His practice and the studies he Is pursuing
along scientific lines were greatly ham
pered by his public duties during the
last administration, and it la known that
he would rather not get into harness
again if he can keep out of It. He iÂ«Â».
however, a warm personal friend of
Mayor Phelan. and is also his Honor's
family physician, and that influence will
probably prove strong enough to compel
his acceptance. Dr. Thomas Shumate is
also generally mentioned a* a probable
member of the board, but he may be ten
dered the position of chief surgeon â¢>( i*ie
Receiving Hospital Instead. Dr. William
R. Dorr and Dr. R. W. Murphy Jr. will
probably be tendered ollicea at either the
harbor or central station. Dr. Dorr has
been attached to the harbor station dur
ing tho present administration, and ulso
mad** an excellent reputation as surgeon
in charge of the big Treadwell Hospital
at Fort Wrangel, Alaska. Dr. Chalmers
Is maktnc a hard light for the position of
City Physician and has some strong
friends behind him.
James H. O'Brien is the latest candldats
who has come prominently into notice as
a probable member of the Civil Service
Commission. Mr. O'Brien wields a pow
erful political Influence In the city and
has always been a consistent supporter of
Mayor Pnelan. and it is said his services
will bo rewarded with pome one or other
of the chief commissions.
There is little change In the Super
visorial situation. Although Supervisor
Jennings has returned from the East it In
not lik< ly that the hoard will caucus until
after the Ist of the month. Mayor Phelan
win tender both Republican and Demo
cratic members a banquet early next
week, and it is expected that the day ror
the organization mooting will be fixed at
that time. The tight for the chairman
ship of the Finance Committee has nar
rowed down to Charles Wesley Re. 11.
U. Brandenstein and "Dick" Hotaling.
Sheriff I.arkmarin Intends to so far ke?p
his pre-election promises to the Grand
Hotel organization that he will accept
from the county committee, through the
district chairmen, suggestions as to the
disposition of the patronage of his office.
No one member of the organisation will
have anything to say in the matter: the
positions will be at the disposition of t!ie
whole organisation, and there will doubt
less be considerable hard work done !n
the next few weeks among district dele
gations. George Hare and Sis: Simon â¢/111
remain in the office. Bo far the commit
tee ordered at the last meeting of the
county committee to Investigate the
course of the campaign committee during
the late fight has done nothing. A num
ber of districts have appointed thÂ»-ir
eommltteemen, but the Thirty-seventh.
Thirty-eighth and Forty-fourth districts
have refused to appoint or take any part
In the Investigation.
