HEROES AS THEY SAIL THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE

THE HARBOR OF HOME.
Scenes of Unparalleled Excitement Mark the
Home-coming of the State's Yolnnteers. j
fhonsands of Men, Women and Children Throng to the
Wharves and Hilltops to Greet the Soldiers on
Their Return From the Wars.
CALIFORNIA'S Volunteers are |
home from the wars. Heralded j
by the deafening boom of can- ;
non, greeted by a myriad of i
boats, cheered again and
again, it seemed in never-ending er.thu-
Fiasm and glad welcome, the heroes of |
the State sailed yesterday afternoon
through the Golden Gate into the bay.
It was a triumphal procession such as
the city in all its history had never
seen before. It was a welcome without I
parallel or precedent on the western j
shore of the American Continent. The
Sherman, groat monster of the sea,
steamed from out of the fog curtain
that hung heavily over the heads.
Slowly the ship moved within the gate.
Thousands of whistles were sounding
their shrill blasts from the city, the
wharves and the hundreds of vessels in
the bay. The mammoth guns of the
forts roared a greeting that was j
echoed and re-echoed among the hills !
in bewildering reverberation. From the â 
hill tops of the city came the hoarse j
acclaim of glad cheers. The soldiers of !
the Golden State were home again,
their debt of patriotism paid to the na
tion.
The day came haze-laden and gloomy.
A heavy fog hung over the Golden
and obscured the northern shore '
ie bay. Masked behind it, as If ;
n by a great curtain, lay the Sher- !
nearly three miles out at sea, |
Within the city all was bustle and con- '
n, the babel of sounds and the
â  x<iting scenes. Men, women
and children were hastening to the hill
and to the wharves. The streets
were thronged with people inspired by
eager, nervous energy and a common |
impulse to honor the men who had j
I ihr-ush the stress and storm of
battle in a triumphant cause.
Along the wharves were gayly !
'lips of every kind, big and I

noon the ships left their moorings and
their docks. Music, patriotic and ex
hilarating, floated over (he waters of j
the bay: cheers horn of the contagion j
eat and enthusiasm sounded I
the wharves. Now and again came
the boom of a signal gun and the an
of waving flags and loud hurrahs.

ward the Golden Gate. The hour for
the home coming of the Californians
was approaching.
Slowly the profession on the bay was
formed. Gradually a broad avenue was

and nearer the procession drew to the

the sullen boom of a

added in tremendous volume to the
tumult and from the city, across the
waters, came the deadened babel of

in the memory of those that saw il.
Its incidents of hysterical excitement,
its babel of sounds, its maze of move
ment and color and enthusiasm never
had a parallel in the history of Ran
Francisco. With something mnrc than
patriotism the people of the city had
gone to the Golden Gate to bring their j
heroes home. ThenÂ» was in it all the
expression of ties dÂ«^per and closer
than those of a common nationality. It
was a welcome for fathers, sons and
sweethearts, and in the gay throngs, in
the cheers and hoarse hurrahs, there
was an undercurrent of sorrow, a
thought of the graves that some, of
California's heroes found when they
answered their nation's call to arms.
It was not long before the Sherman,
travel and storm-beaten, was left a
solitary figure in the bay. The multi

ance and steamed to the docks to re
lease the throngs that had formed the
guard of welcome. Thousands came
from their stations on the hills and
docks. The thoroughfares of the city
were human hives. Confusion reicrned
again in San Francisco, and hastiVv.
nervously, the people prepared for the
night. As darkness came men. women
and children crowded toward the
wharves. They thronged the walks and
usurped the wagon ways. Vehicles of
every description, wagons, carriages,
cars carried their human freight to the
docks. Men and boys climbed upon the
tC'ps of moving cars and shoited their
enthusiasm as they sped toward the
water front. Noise-producing instru
ments of every variety were in commis
sion. As night fell over the city lights
began to gleam on the great buildings.
They were outlined in dazzling bright
ness against the blackness of the sky.
Beacon fires burned on the hilltops and
the murmur of myriad voices, the
sounds of whistles and of bells toid the
boys on the transport that in the city
there was the revelry of gladness.
Suddenly the great tower of the ferry
depot was outlined in flaming lights.
The tremendous structure seemed to
rise a column of fire from the water's
edge. Columns of light danced from
wharf to wharf, and in the bay from
mast to mast were ribbons of flame
stretched. It seemed, on the darkness of
the night. Lazily the tremendous
searchlights of the lowa swept the bay,
bringing out of the blackness the flag
adorned ships at the wharves and the
masses of men and women who had
gathered to see the night display. Tugs
steamed, with their dancing lanterns,
around the transport, and now and
again gave their shrill blasts of greet
ing. Rockets and colored lights flashed
into the air and then a great blaze iit
up the bay. The long celebration of the
day and night was drawing to a close.
The soldiers of the Golden State had
been welcomed home, and from their
dark station in the harbor they could
hear the murmur of the city that meant
to them the best of wishes and good
will.
NAVAL PARADE
IN THE HARBOR
Spectacular Beginning
of the Big Reception.
Gay Craft Escort the Trans
port Sherman to Her
Anchorage.
THE prettiest picture In all the wide,
wide world was presented yesterday
In the landlocked harbor of San
Francisco. From the city front on
one side to the purple shores of Marin en
the other Nature had stretched her can
vas. She called the elements to her aid to |
lay In the background of swelling water, ;
curling into whitecaps, with a grayish
sky above, warming to yellow on the east,
where a belated sun was dissipating tlie
mist into a shifting haze. Out to the went |
a curtain of fog hung over the Golden
Gate.
I'pon this canvas, relieved by this back- j
ground, was to be painted the living pic- !
lure of the meeting of California with her
heroes on board the transport Sherman,
new arrived from the wars and even then
lying on the swelling ocean beyond the in-
Visible bar. Sun Francisco's was the hand
holding the brush.
The entire city moved early from its
hills to the water front, framing one side
of the emerging marine. Eleven o'clock
was the hour set when the first bit of
color would be massed, but long before
that hour the woodwork of the city's side
of the frameâ the wall of piles and slips
and wharves and sheds, from the baige
office to the Mall dockâ was crowded with
humanity. At anchor or moored alongside
â¢was the shipping of the harbor, like pend
ants to the frame, with every bit of bunt
ing from every locker fluttering from peak
and masthead and halyard.
Craft without number there were, and
of every description. Full-rigged ships,
schooners, barks, steamboats, steamships,
transports, natty looking launches and
saucy looking tugs, all flying rainbows of
pennants and flags, all gay in full dress
alow and aloft. On the wharves, on top
of piles, along the stringers, was one long
row of people, from Meiggs wharf to
Brannan street, as gayly decked as the
shipping, Is not as well provided with sea
room.
Everything was moving, the people
taking their cue from the incessant flut
tering^ of the flags. From the city grew
the sound of numberless whistles shriek
ing welcomes to the boys beyond the bar.
Their echoes floated down to the bay in
a harmonious theme, as if some master
was touching his heartstrings to sound
the depth of his feelings. Up above the
hills and the tall buildings could be seen
Â»he puffings of steam from the monster
calliope, whose discordant tootings were
softened by the distance.
The launches called back shrill
answers, the tugs tooted stoutly as if
saying, "We're little, but oh ray!"
Steamboats turned on their steam to add
to the volume, while the inevitable jubi
lee horn and the occasional bell gave the
musical pitch to the whole. It was a
wonderful scene, never to be forgottenâ
the ships, the people, the sounds they
emitted, the groupings they presented.
At 11 o'clock the tugs selected for the
parade began filling up with the ticket
holders. There were no tardy ones and
they wore soon crowded to their limit.
Gay parties gathered on each, and any
number of bands of music, which snon be
gan to make their presence felt and heard
with the latent In music andâ a few of
the earliest, "Home, Sweet Home" and
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home."
No time was lost in getting out the tugs
and absembling the Tines of the naval
parade which was to form the grouping
of the picture, in the foreground of
which was to be the Sherman with its
precious freight for California. No
sooner, had the full complement of guests
been reached on any one vessel than the
signal was given to cast off. and the
holiday craft with its holiday crowd
puffed out into the bay to pick up the
yacht assigned to it and take its place
in the line.
The yachts assigned to the two divisions
of the parade were rendezvousing off sec
tion 3 of the seawall and Meiggs wharf.
While the tugs were still moored to their
wharves the dainty pleasure craft, trim
and clean in their dress of white as any
summer girl, carried ribbons that would
have tried the complexion if not the
temper of that greatly pictured young
woman. Every flag provided for in the
.â¢ode and many that -would distance two
or three codes was flying from every
available stick and rope Yachtsmen in
duck and a plentiful sprinkling of guests

were early on board, full of the spirit of
the occasion and ready to ,be oft and I

taking up the cheer before those on the
docks passed had ceased. Answering yells
and waving of flags from the people
aboard were constant and hearty.
From the tugs the scene was superb.
If any such densely packed crowds of
people ever before gathered on the water
front of San Francisco there is neither
record nor recollection of them. The eye
of the most keen sighted sailor could not
reach the limit of the gatherings. They
covered the wharf space and crowded the
streets leading to it. They w.Â»re as thick
as shingles on every nit-r sh*>d. They
crowned the ridges of the far distant
hills and! they were like ants on the sides
of the nearest. No point from which the
naval pageant could bo seen was slighted.
Telegraph Hill particularly was a favored
spot. Thousands upon thousands of peo
ple capped its summit, concealing the
earth. Hundreds and hundreds of others
braved its declivities, parched on jutting
bits of rock and gazed down <>n the pass
ing craft, unmindful of the jagged rocks
at the bottom of the sheer declivity.
The other sides of the rapidly developing
naval spectacle were no less interesting
Thf sun by this time had managed to lend
a warmer feeling to the air. which quickly
dissipated in the teeth of a twenty-knot
breeze, that served, however, to lift the

fog, Alcatraz Island lifting- boldly, tha
| curtain rising from the Golden Gate and
; Fort Point standing sentinel in a purple
I haze. Across on the Marin shore, white
j against a deep purple. Lime Point stuck
i out below a fleecy bank of cloud. Far
| to the east the battleship lowa was clear
i ly and majestically defined.
All the figures and the properties for tha
living picture were at handâ all but the
principal, the transport Sherman, even
then steaming In to meet the floating city
of relatives and friends.
The tugs, with their tows, were busy
getting into place off the barge office, an-i
when the timeball dropped at noon the
Parade was formed in two columns.
.. Th c Fearless headed the right. She was
the flagship of the fleet, and, as be
came her dignity, was first to take
her place in line, with the yacht Lur-
L ne tÂ° wfn & behind. Her consort was
â¡ Â£i onarcn - wlth th e Pilot boat Gracie
b. The Monarch had orders to keep
abreast of the flagship, and the two lines
dressed on their leaders. With the Fear-
f s 2, was Geor se Knight's naphtha launch
Athlete, detailed to act as aid. With the
Monarch was Frank Moffifs Augusta,
which acted In a similar capacity for the
left column.
One long blast, then a short one, from
the whistle of the Fearless and the naval
parade was in motion toward the Heads.
Everything else unanchored on the bay
followed suit, and two lines originally
designed to string out a thousand yards
became four, a mile long, with craft of
evt-ry description, flying all sorts of dec
oration, strung out to both sides as far
as one could see. To the right of the
nrSi. division slowly steamed the army
transports City of Puebla and Columbia.
Riding still farther to the north were tho
ferry steamers t'kiah. Newark. Pride of
the River, Caroline, Captain Weber, T.
L. v alker. Piedmont and Grace Barton
all laden with excursionists. To the left
was the Monticello with the members of
the citizens' executive committee and
their guests aboard, a number of launches
unattached tugs and whitehails darting
between her and the shore.
Every eye on even' vessel was strained
toward the Gate for the first sight of the
transport. The moments had flown as
swiftly as the tugs were steaming, and it
was nearing 1 o'clock as the head of the
parade drew past the Presidio, where tho
rows of white tents were sown, like th 9
teeth of Cadmus, to yield armed men
Every ear was strained for a signal gun
whereabouts unknown, presumably Alca
traz, maybe Fort Point, announcing the
! entrance into the harbor of the long
looked-for transport.
Boats here and there provided with can
non exasperated the watchers by touch
ing off their ordnance to furnish false
alarms of the desired fact, but no bight
of the Sherman had been had until the
, nagsnip had slowed down under the lee
of the Martn shore. The parade was
ahead of the meeting time, or rather the
Shprman was behind.
The parade had come to a halt, and tak
ing advantage of this the excursion boats
or all descriptions hurried up to the front
keeping for the most part, with commend
able decency, without the lines selected
for the parade manpuvers. The portion of
the bay from the Presidio to Limp Point
was fairly alive with gayly decked ves
sels. Bands began playing, whistles toot
ed and shrieked and coughed, small can
ron popped like firecrackers; but although
everybody waited anxiously for the ap
pearance of the Sherman or the boom of
the gun that announced her approach it
seemed as if it would never come. The
excitement was at fever heat, but there
was nothing to do but wait and make as
much noise as was necessary for the ex
haust of the pent-up feeling.
All of a sudden. "Boom!" There was no
mistaking that gun. It sounded with the
volume of the voice of authority. A big
ruff of blue smoke puffing out from Fort
Point Into the center of the passage
showed whence it came.
"There she is! There she is!" was shout
ed all along the line, and there, sure
enough, was the Sherman, well into the
bay. naving skirted in under cover of the
point and opened out suddenly on the
view, well up the channel. The commit
tee on noise knew its business so well
that its efforts almost drowned out tha
booming of the national salute from t\e
guns in the fort.
The signal to go ahead was fairly
screeched from the Peerless, and the flag
ship led the way out to the harbor en
trance. In and in passed tho white vis
itor, her boys cheering as loudly as their
lungs would warrant in answer to the
snouts of welcome, and waving flags, as
their vessel passed between the lines of
the parade.
Then began the most beautiful figure In
the entire display. The Fearless led it
from the right, the Monarch from the
left. The flagship circled to the left
around the stf-rn of the transport, the
craff. in that column of the parade follow
ing, a hundred yards apart. From the left
the Doats in the column headed by the
Monarch circled to the right, both linos
passing and exchanging positions, for all
the world like a grand-right-and-left in a
quadrille.
The sight is one that will never be for
j gotten by anybody that witnessed it and
i would not have bef-n missed for a great
j deal by those fortunate enough to be
participants. From every vessel in sight
numberless flags were b^ing waved, whis
tles tooted, bombs exploded, clouds lift-
Ing above and sunshine suddenly breaking
for the blue and brown coated boys
aboard the big white transport. They had
all crowded on the decks and all were
! shouting themselves hoarse, peering be-
I tween shout? into the confusion of flags
and noise and music and boats ahead for
the one or two or threp beloved soon to be
| clasped to a manly breast.
The yachts and the tugs towing them
j were still passing around the stern, per
forming the manpuvers without accident,

THE BIVOUAC
OF THE DEAD.
THEODORE OMARA.
THE muffled drums sad roll has. beat the soldier's last tattoo,
Xn more on life's jjarade shall meet that brave and fallen few;
On Fame's eternal camping ground their silent tents are spread,
Where glory guards, with solemn round, the bivouac of the dead.
No rumor of the foe's advance now dwells upon the wind,
No troubled thought at midnightâ haunts of loved ones left behind;
No vision of the morrow's strife the warrior's dream alarms;
No braying horn nor screaming fife at dawn shall call to arms.
Their shivered swords are red with rust, their plumed heads are bowed;
Their haughty banner trailed in dust is now their martial shroud;
And plenteous funeral tears have washed the red stains from each brow,
And the proud forma by battle gashed are free, from anguish now.
The neighing troop, the flashing blade, the bugle's stirring blast,
Thf charge the dreadful cannonade, the din and shout are past:
Nor war's wild note, nor glory's peal, shall thrill with fierce delight
Those breasts that never more may feel the rapture of the fight.
Like the fierce Northern hurricane that sweeps his high plateau.
Flushed \\ i t h the triumph yet to gain came down the serried foe,
Who heard the thunder . .f the fray break o'er the field beneath
Knew well the watchword of that day was "Victory or death!' ,
I ong has the doubtful conflict raged o'er all that stricken plain,
For never fiercer light had waged the vengeful blood of Spain;
\nd still the storm of battle blew, still swelled the gory tide;
Not iungâ our stout old chieftain knew such odds his strength could bide.
'Twaa in that hour his stern command called to a martyr's grave
The flower of his beloved land the nation's flag to save;
T'.y ri\ns of their fathers' sore his first-born laurels grew,
\r.d well he deemed their suns would pour their lives fur glory, too.
Full many a mothers breath has swept o'er Angostura's plain.
\i â¢(" lung the pitying Bky has wept above the moldering slain;
Th. raven's scream, or eagle's flight, or shepherd's pensive lay,
Uone awakes each sullen height that frowned on that dread fray.
Sons of the dark and bloody ground, ye must not slumber there,
Where stranger steps and tongues resound along heedless air;
V..ur own proud land's heroic soil shall be your fitter graveâ
She claims from war his richest spoilâ the ashes of her brave.
Thus 'neath their parent turf they rest, far from the gory field,
Borne to a Spartan mother's breast on many a bloody shield.
The sunshine .if their native sky smiles sadly on them here,
And kindred eyes and hearts watch by the soldiers' sepulcher.
Rest on embalmed and sainted dead, dear as the blood ye gave;
No Impious footstep hero shall tread the herbage of your grave;
Star shall y >ur glory be forgot while Fame her record keeps
Or Honor points the hallowed spot where valor proudly sleeps.
Ton marble minstrel's voiceless stone in deathless song shall tell,
When many 8 vanquished age hath flown, the story how ye fell;
X ir wreck nor change nor winter's blight, nor Time's remorseless doom,
Shall dim one ray of glory's light that gilds your deathless tomb.

ri v f ., â¢ did what they could to

Captain Weber, both stern- wheelers, were

Weber ran acn ss the hows of the flag
ship and started after the Walker. Most
of the. other boats held aloof, as the orders
for thÂ« parade directed, but besides tnu
two mentioned there were â  few others
that preferred to risk spoiling the line
to get a nearer viev .
One of these was the Governor Per

not put any <i ard. nor did her
doctors make any Inquiries as to the
health of the men >>n the transport. In
stead, she ran alongside, and then Harry
Wise nlm was- a passenger, climbed out
on her bows, and with a few friends,
commenced to throw sample bottles 01
whisky to the soldiers. There 1? no rule
of the transport service more strict than
that which forbids the use of liquor
aboard. There is no rule more strict
among the troops than that whleh for
bids the Issue of liquor, but with no ex
cuse for t lit- violation, Wise and his
friends tossed up the bottles to the
poldiers along the transport rail. Every
one had fruit or flower? or greetings of
some sensible kind for the men, but it
rested with Wise and his friends to con
ceive thi Idea of dealing out whisky by
the bottle. Captain Barneson. superin
tendent of the transport service, saw
what was going on and he got Into the

port to slop tin alcoholic offerings of the
Perkins' passengers. Before lie arrived,
however, the Perkins had heen given

PANORAMA OF
THE INCOMING
All San Francisco that was not on the
bay yesterday afternoon was gathered on
the heights and shores overlooking that
beautiful expanse of water, bent upon
sating its appetite with the grand spec
tacle of welcome to the returning Cali
fornia volunteers.
"There she comes! See her masts!"
She's coming in!"
The warning injunctions, delivered in
excited tones by hundreds of watchful
lookouts armed with marine glasses and
telescopes, suddenly recalled the pa
tiently waiting thousands thronging the
heights and hills overlooking the waters
of the bay from their admiring contem
plation of the maneuvering steamers and
yachts composing the reception fleet, and
directed their gaze once more toward the
Golden Gate. A slight haze hung over
Iho harbor ontranop, somewhat, obscuring
! the viev , and a sigh of disappointment
arose, which was suddenly checked as the
lookouts were again heard shouting vo
ciferously:
â 'Look behind the fort! See her mast?:"
Then the tapering ppars of the army
transport were made out, looming Indis
tinctly through the mist as the Sherman
passed into the harbor from behind old
Port Wtnh'r-ld Scott. The half-uttered
sigh changed on the instant to a tremen
dous shout of gratified anticipation and
joy.
A moment later the transport poked her
white nose past Fort Point, and the hills
shook with the cheers that arose sponta
neously from more thnn 30.00(1 throats.
The n;lst again enveloped the steamer as
she cleared the point and headed over
toward Angel Island, but only for a mo
! ment: and when the haze lifted the cheer
j ing was renewed with redoubled vigor and
enthusiasm.
From a spectacular standpoint the
crowds on the shore had by far the best
opportunity for viewing the grand
pageant, and those who had been pre
vented from going out on the water to
greet the returning California volunteers
folt amply satisfied with the fate that
. decreed that they should remain on
! shore.
I Never in the history of San Francisco
has there been such a grand outpouring
of people as that which gathered on the
points of vantage all along the bay front
yesterday afternoon to feast their eyes
jon the grand spectacular welcome in
| honor of the returning soldier boys and
| add their shouts of greeting to the din of
| noise that was wafted out to the brave
I lads on the transport as she slowly made
her way majestically up the bay.
Thousands upon thousands of spectators
lined the crests of Rlncon, Telegraph and
Russian hills, while other unestimated
thousands crowded the terraced slopes of
the heights, occupying every point of
vantage from the loftiest height along the
shore clown to the water's edge, and
stretching from Folsom street to the
Cliff House.
Every vacant plat of ground that af
forded a view of the bay was pre-empted
hours before the transport left her an
chorage outside the Heads, the housetops
alone being reserved for the favored few.
The embankment surrounding the Spring
Valley reservoir on Hyde street furnished
an especially desirable view point, and
every foot of space thereon was uitlized,
until the guards in charge were nearly
driven frantic with anxiety lest some of
the thousand or more congregated there
on, venturesome to the verge nf foolhardl
ness, should slip down the precipitous in
cline into the deep water at the bottom
of the great tank. Fortunately no serious
accident occurred to cast a gloom over
the pleasure of the occasion.
The soldiers doing guard duty at Fort
Mason had a trying time of it keeping the
crowds from invading the sacred precinct
wheroin are located the officers' quarters
and the soldiers' barracks and the main
fortifications. In spite of their utmost
vlgila-nce a few would slip past them oc
casionally, only to be brought to a sudden
stop by the stentorian command, "Halt!
Come back and go the other way."
The Presidio reservation swarmed with
citizens, and thia condition prevailed
along the beach to the Cliff House and
beyond. Those at the Cliff House were
the first to get a view of the transport
as she headed in through the Golden Gate,
but they missed the brilliant pageant of
the inner harbor, none of the reception
fleet going outside the Heads, and the
crowd were left alone by themselves
and the temporarily neglected seals.
It was a patient multitude and it 6 pa
tience was rewarded when, after hours
of expectant gazing, the big transport
finally entered the bay and was received
by the myriads of gayly bedecked yachts
and steamers of the reception fleet. The
bay craft, accompanied by a few ocean
going steamers as a sort of chaperons,
steamed out nearly to Fort Point in
double column formation. As the Sher
man entered the lane thus opened invit
ingly for her the saluting whistles and
guns began their discordant but exhil
arating greetings.
Then was witnessed one of the prettiest
sights of the day as the parallel lines a&
tugs, with their tows, slowly circled
around the transport in opposite direc
tions, with flags and streamers flying
from every mast and spar and guns boom-
Ing incessantly. The sirens on land re
doubled their blasts in a seeming effort
to obtain the recognition which their dis
tance from the scene practically denied
them.
Cheer after cheer arose from the vast
throngs on the heights as the reception
fleet once more headed up the bay, proud
ly escorting the soldier voyagers of whom
going steamers as a sort of chaperons,
sill California is so justly proud, and the
cheering did not cease until the anchors of
the Sherman rattled from hor bow as she
came abreast of Folsom-street dock.
Then the crowds made a simultaneous
riish for the cars, and within an hour the
height? were again deserted, except fur
their everyday residents. It was a great
day for the landlubbers of San Francisco,
as'well as for those who like to sniff the
salt sea breezes from the deck of a
steamer or yacht, and the former had the
advantage at position in this instance.
Vi< wed from the shore the bay parade
was a grand, unqualified success.
OFFICIAL VISIT
TO COL. DUBOCE
Shortly after the Sherman had found
an anchorage Messrs, Martin, De Young
and Lawrence of the executive com
mittee and Mayor Phelan went out on the
Montlcello and paid an official visit to
Colonel Dtiboce and the officers of his
staff. They were received by the colonel
himself at the gang plank and escorted
to the upper deck where a ten-minute
levee was held.
The visit was essentially formal and no
business- save the question of disembarka
tion was discussed. The time was given
up to a friendly exchange of courtesies.
The monlbers of the committee, the
Mayor, Colonel Sullivan and the others
of' the party were all personally
acquainted with the colonel and with
most of his officers, and the reception
was a royal one and enjoyed keenly by
all concerned.
Concerning business. Colonel Diiboce
said he would dock and begin the work
of getting ashore at 7:30 this morning,
but beyond that he could not programme
until he had had time to study his official
orders.
Down on the lower deck the men of the
ranks gathered, and as a member of the
committee, or the Mayor came in sight
above them, they cheered heartily and
announced that they were home and glad
of it. An ovation was tendered the of
ficials when they descended on the way to
their boat, and much time was consumed
in handshaking with old friends or old
employes who had given up everything
else to go aflghting. Over 150 discharged
men Were taken ashore on the Monticello
when she put back to the Mission-street
pier.

II of the vessel bearing them home to
the fond hearts waiting to receive
them was pricked off on a thousand charts
and the city had figured almost to a cer
tainty the time they would arrive. It was
to be Thursday forenoon. -â¢â¢ - â¢. -â >.-'
j But if San Francisco's populace had pro- !
posed, it lay with the winds and the waves
to dispose, and the elements willed it oth
erwise. The boys had come in from their
different afternoon details and were sit
ting at their ' various desks in the local
room engaged on the composition of their
stories, when a telephone in the editor's
sanctum rang. He bent down to catch
the message it had. to. deliver, and the
next minute, jumping from his seat, gave
the signal and The Call's' cannon boomed
out the joyful news that the Sherman had
been sighted and had upset all calcula
tions by appearing on the evening horizon
just as it was growing dim to mark the
close of Wednesday, August 23, 1899.
In a minute all was commotion. Report
ers -were thrown . out of the, office as
though shot from a catapult and thread-
Ing their way through the dense crowds
that were already beginning to gather,
hurried off to the different posts to
which they had been assigned. As I had
once been a member of the California
Regiment myself and had many friends
in the ranks, I was detailed to the tug
Alert, with orders to get on board the
Sherman at all hazard.
Just as we arrived on the tug we saw
launches bearing the representatives of
other papers heading down the bay, bound
full tilt for the Golden Gate. In a minute
the tug's moorings were cast off and
away we went after them. The engineer j
had orders to feed the furnaces with sides
of bacon, put a Filipino on the safety
valve and open her up. He did. Grad
ually gaining headway, the tug's speed
Increased until she seemed to fairly skip
over the waters, touching only the tops of
the white-capped waves as she new on her
way. Wharf after wharf flew past with
a rapidity that made the piles look like
telegraph poles as seen from thÂ« windows
of a passing express train. ' Black Point
was reached, and there we caught up with
the launches that had preceded us just ,
as they were turning around to go back
over their course. They had discovered
that the waters outside were too rough
for them.
Not so with the Alert. Continuing boldly ;
on her course she met the first big roller-'
that came tumbling in through the Gate,
and with a mighty plunge that sent the
white spray in sheets. over her deck and
house broke her. way through it. Sea after
sea was met and conquered as the boat
surged onward, looking for the boys co
whom she was bringing the first message ,
of .greeting they were to receive from that
country on which they have cast such
luster by the glory of their achievements. ;
At last some few lights were Been ;
twinkling in the darkness that had now
settled upon the ocean, and the tug's !
course was headed toward them. Finally
the outlines of a huge vessel were dis
cerned, and there, in the mists that wrap
themselves about the lightship, a big
transport lay, gently rolling. Hiding at
anchor, she rose and fell, responsive to
the blue ocean billows that threw their
greetings to her as they surged past to
ward the Golden Gate. Aboard of her a.
thousand men 'were lining the rails and
darkening the portholes with eager faces
that peered anxiously out into the night
trying to discern the coast outlines,
watching the dull glow that tinged the
somber neavens with a ruddy promise of
the bright homes that were waiting to j
enfold them just behind those dark lumps ;
of sandhills that, raising from the water's !
edge, were dimly outlined in the pale i
light of the rising moon.
The men aboard the vessel were not
clothed in the swell apparel of aristo
cratic tourists. Their clothes were torn
and frayed, soiled and spotted; but Solo
mon in all his glory never made as beau
tiful an appearance as did these boys in
their old army clothes to the few who had
gone to greet them. Every rent in their
garments told of privation borne uncom
plainingly, every spot was a decoration
that told more eloquently of the glory
that was theirs than could the most costly
fabrications of the Jeweler's art. The
men were California's own heroic sons re
turned from a glorious and victorious
war, waiting to receive the tribute of
honor and affection that their native
country was waiting to proffer them. At
last after months of weary waiting: the
boys had come back to their own.
I don't know what the people in the city
were doing, but I con Imagine. Great as
their satisfaction was it was fully equaled
by the delight of the lads themselves. As
soon as the tug approached within hail
ing distance the firing line along the rails
opened on It with volley after volley of
questions and happy messages. The bable
of voices became so great that it was
impossible to distinguish anything save
the one word "Home" in the great '
symphony of joyous salutation. A boat
was lowered from the tug and three of

lus went alongside. We were told that
we could not board, and had no intention
I of doing bo. A rope ladder was hanging
' clown the side of the vessel, and on this
we mounted so as to converse with those
on deck. The Swede who rowed us over
abandoned us as soon as he saw us on
I the bit of rope and pulled back to the
; tug, leaving us. hanging to the ship s side.
j lV \Vhere are you from?" asked some one
!on board We replied we were from The
1 Call. That was enough. In a minute a
: hundred pairs of hands were stretched out
I to' 1 our <>oat collars, and in a minute we
were hauled aboard. Some of us went
over the rail. Some were yanked through
the portholes. The boys were crazy for
news and landed up among themselves
! despite our resistance.
Once aboard we were fairly over
| whelmed. "Have- you seen mother?
"Where Jack?" "is Billy waiting for
me?" "Lord, but I'll bet the old man will
be glad to see me. Did he send any mes
sage?" The questions Hew so fast that it
was impossible *to answer except in a
I general way. Here and there some poor
! fellow would draw one of us quietly aside
! and, with tears starting from his eyes,
ask for some loved one whose caresses he
! will never receive until he journeys across
' that fathomless ocean that separates
I time from eternity. I have seen many
! a sad thing in my life, but 1 know of
j nothing that was more touching than the
j sight of these poor fellows who, amid the
I general rejoicing, returned only to re
i ceive the news of the death of a parent
j or relative whose welcome had been the
i center piece around which had clustered
' their every vision of home; whose longed
j for caress had been the one great reward
j which was to repay them for the months
of weary exile they had undergone.
As soon as I could be discovered a mes
j senger approached and told me I was
: wanted on the quarterdeck. I went thoro
i and was promptly put under arrest for
violating the quarantine law. I told the
j officer to seek out ond apprehend the
guilty Swede who was the cause of my
I plight by leaving me hanging to the rope
! ladder. I was told that the excuse was a
i poor one and that I was to consider my
self a prisoner confined within the limits
of the ship. As the tug had already left
i and as I could not swim to the Cliff
, Couse, that fact was as apparent to me
: as it was to my two companions. Honig
; and Britt, who had also been placed under
the ban. So I went forward among the
, boys of the regiment, there to receive a
: greeting that would have made impris
onment in far worse quarters than those
i of the Sherman a welcome detail indeed.
1 Again I was overwhelmed with questions.
j They came at me from all sides, and in
self-defense I had to ask a few myself.
. After the first burst of excitement had
j passed things began to quiet down a bit,
! and little by little the news of their trip
â¢ across the Pacific was obtained. As that
i has already been published in the columns
of this paper It is not necessary to say
anything further on the subject save that
I the weather was beautiful, the sea calm
! and everything had been as pleasant as
! good weather, good health and the pros
! pect of home at the end of the journey
cculd make it.
The boys joked, danced, played cards,
I sang and hung over the rail until far Into
' the night, watching the lights twinkling:
on the shore and speculating on the splen
did welcome that awaited them there.
i Some time after The Call boat had re
j turned to the shore with the news other
newspaper boats commenced to arrive.
I Their passengers exhausted every device
in the endeavor to get on board, but each
attempt was Â» failure, and at last they
were obliged to desist and retire amid the
; good-natured, laughing badinage ol the
! hundreds of veterans who hung over the
: ship's sides and joshed them as they re
treated, advising them to read The Call In
the morning and get the newÂ«.
Finally the last boat departed and the
ship was left in solitude. Then the boys
broke up into little groups and sat around
discussing the momentous events which
had passed since they had last seen the
lights guarding the harbor entrance of
San Francisco Bay. Many a wild tale
was told and many a desperate deed re-
I counted, but during the entire evening
I I did not hear one man speak who made
j his own prowess the subject of his narra
tive. When praise was bestowed it was
always upon some absent comrade, gen
erally upon one who will never return.
They are brave men, these California
Volunteers, and like all brave men they
are modest. Well let them be so; their
deeds speak for them. â¢ - â 
The hours sped on and on. One by
one the boys drifted below and retired to
their well earned rest. Finally the last
straggler had left the deck and the si
lence echoed to the measured footfall of
the sentry pacing out his last guard.
Then I also retired, going to the bunk
that Adjutant Curzons, my old lieuten
ant, had kindly given up to me â there to
pass a night of troubled dreams in which
customs officers, prison bars, dungeons,
clanking cHains and other horried things
were mingled up in one great hair-raising
: Jumble.
Reveille is supposed to be for the pur
pose of awakening the slumbering soldier.
There was no need of it yesterday morn-
Ing. Long before the gray light of early
dawn had shot Its first rays over me
Berkeley hill? the entire regiment was
awake and on deck, eagerly straining for
the first glimpse of their beloved shore.
Even before the day had reached them
The Call was there to supply the boys
with fruit and papers. How the boys
lit upon them. They fairly tore each
other apart in their endeavor to get at

the news: and fruit disappeared like the
festive June bug before the rapacious
turkey gobbler. Some one remarked to
a grimy private, who was losing his face
in an immense peach, on the dangers of
Btomach trouble. "Never fear." replied
the half-dressed soldier, "nothing grown
on California land will hurt us."
As soon as the mists of night com
menced to fade all hands turned to and
watched for the first glimpse of land.
At last it became light enough for the
outline of the coast to appear, and wren
the Man: County hills dawned fresh and
fair on the vision of the soldiers a shout
arose that seemed to rend the mists apart
as though to allow the day to more
quickly approach and afford to th eyes
of the wanderers an unobstructed view
of their own fatherland. With the dawn
ing 'ho visitors cinnmenced to arrive.
They came nut of the entrance of the
harbor in every availahle sort of a craft.
Anything that would float was pressed
into service. The boys had' made a
break! of fruit bread and coffee. The
regular army rations were thrown over
board to the ills. They were too near
home to relish canned beef. All prepa
rations for going shore had been comp
leted days before. They had com
menced the day they left Manila, and |
everything was ready. So. as the boats j
circled round and round the big ship the
troops, crowding the deck and rigging,
gave themselves up to the ecstacy of
their home-coming. Campaigning, with
all Its hardships and privations, was at
an end. Grim visaged war had smoothed
his wrinkled front, and the lads who had
carried the old grizzly to victory on many j
a hard-fought field, abandoning all else, â 
turned themselves loose to caper to the
music of their sweethearts' voices. Away
above the regimental flag floated from the
masthead where it had been hoisted to
welcome the rirst ray of sunlight while |
the bard played the national hymn and ;
ail stood with uncovered head to watch j
its ascent. , â  i
On deck all was mirth and laughter. The
volunteers' work was at an end and happi
ness reigned supreme.
At the appointed hour the great ship got
up her anchor and started slowly and ma- !
jestically toward the harbor, whose en
trance was already gay with bunting
floating from the hundreds of craft of all
sorts and sizes, which were coming out j
to meet and t-tcort her in. Meeting Â» >c .

House; the long line "of gaily decorattd
yachts arid steamers circled around and
around her. their bands playing inspiring
airs and â¢ heir ' thousands of passengers
waving flags and handkerchiefs and
shouting a welcome that was, truly royal.
The boys remained silent. They just
looked on as though stunned by an ova
tion which has probably never before been
equaled In the entire history of their
country.

fold by wounding my professional pride.
There "is some excuse for him, however.
He was a stranger to me and may have
imagined I represented another paper.
Once inside the Heads and through with
the doctor the big ship proceeded up thÂ«
bay escorted by everything that could

wharves signaled by everything that could

tliÂ» Bplck and span little Monticello with
the executive committee and its Invited
guests aboard pulled itself free from
Miss) >n-street pier and went booming
along in a well-churned wake on her way
to Fort Point.
It was with a cargo of dignitaries the
Monticello was laden; dignataries who
for the moment, threw off dignity and
every other staid quality to shout and
ch^er the returned heroes in voice that
rang as true as ever did pure coin of the
realm Up in the bow were Committee

the members of the finance committee
and Congressman Julius Kshn, City and

When the Sherman hovp In sight off

and high up In the Incoming fog out of the
smoke of the second explosion appeared a
gay little parachute and floating below it

Dr. A. P. O'Bri< n. Dr. Rethers, Dr. Far
rr-11, lieutenant <"har!es llnpn and Cap
tain Edgar Suttliffe, all officers of the
First, who returned from Manila earlier
in the campaign, were on the Montieello
as guests of the committee, and they were
cheered time and again as the boat drew
nearer the transport and they were recog
nlzi 1 by their fellow officers.
There were at leasi 160 people on ihe
Monticello, and the matter of providing
for them had been left to Mr. de Young.
There were edibles of every description,
and wines and softer things in the flLirl
line, and a pleasant half hour was spent
in discussing them, while the band on the
hurricane deck vied with the mortars in
turning patriotism loose into the cheer
rent atmosphere.
The Monticello kept pace with the Sher
mar until anchorage was reached, and
then with a parting salvo she circled
round the lowa and steamed back to her
dock.
SOLDIERS ARE
APPRECIATIVE
Boom went the seventeen guns for the
Governor's salute from the bow of the
Sherman and a chorous of voices from the
halyards trailed each 6hot with the senti
ment, "Never touched me." It was Just
before this incident that the First Cali
fornia Regiment woke up fully to the
I realisation of* the magnitude of the
I aquatic reception In its honor. After the
boom of the cannon the wildest sort "f en
thusiasm prevailed on board the Sherman.
and the war voices of the soldiers rolled
<iut shouts and whoops that shook the hills
on either side of the bay.
Although something unparalleled, some
thing gigantic, was anticipated by the
First California, fur they had heard of
the preparations on foot for their recep
tion, nothing like the scene which was un
rolled before their eyes was even imag-
Ined. The vanguard of tugs and ocean
steamers that plowed seaward and met
t!-..> Sherman soon after she weighed an
chor elicited a few rousing cheers. The
soldier boys had not yet warmed up to the
occasion, and they were wailing for -.he
next number of the programme. Once In
side the Golden Gate the mantle of re
serve was cast off. and then an intense
and vociferous emotion marked every turn
of the screws as. the Sherman worked its
lazy course down the bay. Khaki-uni
formed volunteers twisted in the rigging
and yelled themselves hoarse, and every
soldier who had an instrument of noise
worked it to a white heat. There were
cheers of joy. of supreme satisfaction and
unbridled excitement whenever any new
craft inordinately packed with human
freight and decked with gaudy bunting,
wan discovered.
"That is a reception and a welcome,"
paid a soldier in Company L. "It makes
one forget all about the hardships, the
sore spots and the hard knocks of a year's !

studded the booms and made themselves
one with the rigging just as the order for
entering the harbor was given, they were
more or less apathetic. This was but mo
mentary, however. The rest of the trip
was a gradual outpouring of enthusiasrr
and ecstatic emotion until the grand
finale, when soldier in the rank-s and
epauletted officer began to forget their
differences in rank and joined in the same
harmonic accord.
As the ship rode past the wharves the
cheering swelled louder and louder. The
familiar sights in holiday array touched
the soldier heart. "Back again, and what
a parade!" was the common acclaim fore.
aft or midships. "Who wouldn't be a
California soldier?" some one shouted
from a ttiÃ. The cry was caught up on

When the Santa Rosa got within hail

BIG CARNIVAL
ON THE WATER
Grand Pyrotechnic Dis
play a Great Success.
Brilliancy of the Demonstra
tion Slightly Marred
by Fog.
Countless thousands gathered along the
water front last night to witness the
grant! Illumination and pyrotechnic dis
play in honor of the return of California's
brave heroes. The haze, which hung like
a gauzy curtain over the surface of the
water, partially obscured the view* of the
crowd* of spectators who thronged the
pier* nr hung like monkeys from the rig
ging of the ships lying alongside; but it
could not dampen their enthusiasm nor
smother the brilliancy of the scene en
acted before their eyes. They saw enough
to satisfy them thnt the gallant volun
teers who have battled so nobly in their
country's cause were ing tendered a
reception befitting their worth so far as
climatic conditions would permit, and they
voiced their appreciation with a spon
taneous f-nergy that thrilled the blood and
proved conclusively that the tooting of
whistles and the shrieking of sirens was
1 ut an Incident and not an essential part
of the I>H? celebration^
The booming of cannon with which the
arrival of the Sherman off the Golden
Gate lirid been signaled and to the ac
companiment of which the big white
transport had made her triumphant
entry Into the harbor, gave piace to the
whirr -if hundreds of skyrockets and the
reporta of bursting bombs.
It was a magnificent demonstration of
partriotic love for the soldier, but un
fortunately its magnificence was marred,
or rather hidden; from the sight of many
by the untimely presence of the fog.
Hut in the Immediate vicinity of the
Sherman, which was ail aglow with light
from hundreds of electric bulbs, the
seer.c was one of almost unparalleled
splendor, and as the transport was the
center of attraction, Ihe target for the
bombs and skyrockets; it mattered little
if tin- great beacons m Mount Tamalpais
acrosti the bay were invisible. Tamal- j
pais -mil its bonfires were a secondary
consideration and would have merited
but a passing glance had they been
visible when considered in connection
with the greater snow.
The Illumination started a little ahead
of time, inn not too early for the crowd,
which completely rilled the docks and lit
eraily covered the freight sheds and ship
ping along the front. The throng included
a great, seething mass of humanity,
Stretching clear across last street, leav
ing Market. Mission. Howard and Folsom
hopelessly barred even from a sight of the [
water. ,
Tlih bay in the vicinity of the transport I
was fairly alive with water craft, irom
the l>if.v tugs and river steamers to the
little naphtha launches and rowboats, all
crowded with sightseers brimming with
joyful anticipation Â«,t what was to come.
The great battleship lowa had been
brought up from her anchorage off the
Union Iron Works, ami she had taken a
position scarcely a hundred yards astern
of th? Sherman. Shi loomed up through .
the mist like .i great watchdog guarding
a child from possible harm.
Suddenly the great tower on the ferry
building gleamed forth through the murky
atmosphere in all the dazzling brilliancy
of its elaborate electrical decorations. The
effect was grand; almost sublime. The
liig structure: outlined In fire against he
background of fog, seemed like a blazing
t-haft rising abruptly from the deep,
murky waters of the bay. Almost simul
taneously With this unexpected spectacle j
it seemed as though the cord attached to |
every whistle afloat and ashore was pulled
and tied down, while a half-dozen search-!
lights Hashed toward the tower, render- '
ing the water and the piers for a great
distance as light as day, despite the pres
ence of the haze.
These searchlights played a not unim
portant part in the water carnival. The
four on the lowa were kept continually
moving, crossing and recrosslng. and oc
casionally focusing their rays on a crowd
ed pier like a lieryâyed giant. The Sher
man's searchlights also contributed to the
misty brilliancy of the scene, and another
located on the roof of a downtown busi
ness house flashed its rays Intermittently
in the direction of the transport.
A few minutes after the illumination of
the Bfrry tower a great shower of
bombs arid skyrockets were sent up from
a barge anchored well out in the stream.
A similar shower was .set off from the
end of the Government pier at the same
moment ami the two bursting together al
most directly over thÂ« lowa, descended in
a cloud of brilliantly colored sparks which
can be likened to a rain of gems of the
rarest value. That was the initial feature
of the pyrotechnic display, but, brilliant
though It was, it was far from being the
grandest. From that moment until taps
was sounded at 10 o'clock, the haze was
continually rent by streaming rockets and
bursting shells from both ship and shore.

THE CITY ABLAZE WITH LIGHT.
Every yacht and tug contributed its quota
and the vast multitude on the .were
in ecstacies of delight.
When the torch was applied to the bar
rels of tar and other highly Inflammable
material which formed the cargo of the
old hulk representing the destruction of a
Spanish warship, an Involuntary cheer
burst from- 10,000 throats that must have
{seen heard on the other side of the bay.
The blazing hulk burned for an hour or
more and was plainly visible all along the
water front and from every point of van
tage in the city.
The picture on the water made by the
slowly moving tugs and quickly darting
launches was extremely beautiful and full
of action; and the dim outlines of yachts
at anchor a short distance away and an
occasional ferry steamer wending Its way
toward its slip formed appropriate ad
juncts.
The view from the water craft looking
landward was no less entrancing. The
fiery ferry tower was a sort of center
piece around which were grouped lesser
illuminations. Strings of colored lanterns
suspended from toe pier stringers shone
out over the water like a blazing: ruffle
on the city's skirt. Above them the big
arc lights on the docks and suspended
over the streets beyond glowered through
the misty atmosphere, while the many
private illuminations along East street
and other sections of the front were
dimly visible. Further back and higher
up in the city an occasional rocket cut a
red streak across the sky.
To the volunteers on the transport the
display in their honor was grand beyond
their power to describe. They laughed
and cheered and exchanged jokes with the
passengers on the excursion boats as they
passed and repassed the transports, but
the defiant ring of the warrior was not
perceptible in their voices. They were
subdued by th.- intensity of their feelings,
and seemed almost overcome at the mag
nitude and evident sincerity of the wel
come they found awaiting them. They
gave plenty of evidence of how thorough
ly they enjoyed the demonstration in their
honor, but their manner was similar to
that of a long-lost child being restored to
his parents and almost overcome by his
emotions.
But the night carnival on the bay was
over at last, and with a parting toot and
cheer for the soldier boys on the trans
port the little fleet of steam craft turned
Its prows shoreward and discharged its
precious cargoes, the docks were gradu
ally deserted, and the tired but nappy
multitude wenaed Its way homeward.
During the evening a concert arranged
by the Harbor Commissioners was given
by the band from the training ship Pen
eacola in the grand nave of the ferry
building. It was enjoyed by thousands
who had been able to obtain hut a
meager and unsatisfactory view of the
demonstration on the water. All the col
ored electric lights which constitute the
interior decoration of the building were
turned on and drew many expressions of
admiration from th/> visiting throngs.
The beautiful effect of the illumination
of the exterior of the building has been
the subject of a great many well deserved
compliments. The only display in the city
that will at all compare with it in bril
liancy is the magnificent spectacle pre
sented by the City Hall with its hundreds
of electric lights encircling its dome and
outlining its great pillars.
Next to those, the display that has been
voted the most beautiful is the electrical
illumination of the Hearst building at. the
corner of Market and Third streets. Mrs.
Phebe Hearst has been lavish in her ex
penditure to secure a brilliant and artistic
effect, and she succeeded. Long ropes of
electric lights in red, white and blue are
festooned about the front of the building,
extending from the roof to the first story.

of prominence, with a framework of lights
inclosing an illuminated design, "Califor

striking feature of the decorations and the
most beautiful is a great cross in red elec
tric globes, which occupies the most
prominent position in the angle of the
building. The design as a whole, and Hip
giant cross In particular, drew th*> admir
ing gaze of thousands of pedestrians on
the street last night, and the praise be-
Btowed upon it was well merited.
CITY WENT WILD
WITH THE NIGHT
If Joy is intoxicating San Francisco was
on a terrible time last night. It was sat
urated with patriotism and enthusiastic
to the point of hysterics. The town never
before felt as it did yesterday. It was
never so thoroughly imbued with happi
ness or so completely satisfied with itself.
When the Sherman was sighted the ex
citement began. When the ship came
through the Golden Gate a feeling of wild
exhilaration took possesison of the peo
ple, but it was not until the night wore
on that the city went wild. Everybody
turned out. everybody shouted and every
body tried to outdo his fellow in outland
ish antics and unheard-of modes of mani
festing: his joy. %
While it was yet daylight crowds wend
ed their way toward the water front and
the ferry depot. Some sought a Klimpse
of the transport and the chance of a few
words of greeting to a relative or friend
among the soldier boys aboard. Others
were attracted by the bay illumination
and the thousands of electric lights glis
tening in all their grandeur on the ferry
depot tower. Many went because the
crowd was going. They were caught In
the stream of humanity and were carried
along with the current.
From whence all that vast multitude
came no one could venture to say. And
what became of those countless thou
sands? The march was nil in one direc
tionâall toward the city's water front.
There was apparently no countermarch.
That crowd spread along the docks and
wharves until the front was a surging
mass of humanity, and there it remained,
cheering itself hoarse until far into the
night.
The promenade was not confined to the
sidewalks. From curb to curb the street
was Oiled with pedestrians. At one time
it appeared that the water front had been
filled to the limit, and the ever increasing
and never ending stream of people crowd
ed Market street as far up as Third, and
the onward march was stopped. A string
of cable cars reached from the ferry to a
point beyond the Claus Spreckels build
ing. They were jammed to the limit with
human freight, even the tops being black
with people.
When it appeared that the progress, of
the procession had been stopped for the
night the ranks down by the ferry broke
away, and on. on, on continued the prom
enade. Every cable car carried a load to
the ferry and returned to the outlying dis
tricts without a passenger.
This procession marched to odd music.
The discordant noise from fish horns, cow
bells and rattles was what the crowd
wanted, and was just what it got. The
mingled tinkle and toot and screech from
the endless number of noise-producing
contrivances would have driven the city
crazy on any other occasion.
"When Johnnie Comes Marching Home"
THE CALL'S TRIUMPH.
Oakland Tribune.
The San Francisco Call's war supplement issued this morning in honor
of the home coming of the California Volunteers is one of the most mag
nificent achievements in the history of American journalism. In every detail
the supplement is a work of art and a thing of beauty. The first of the
eight pages is devoted to a picture of the transport Sherman plowing her
way through the Golden Gate that stands out with the vividness of an oil
painting. The other illustrations that adorn every page are equally appro
priate and spirited. _ ,
The most notable of these is a full-page illustration of the heroic Cali
fornians charging to the rescue of the Pennsylvanians when those gallant
soldiers were attacked by the Spaniards during a terrific etorm on the night
of July 31, IS9Bâ the first battle of the Philippine war. The grim face of
Brigadier General Janus F. Smith, together with those of Colonel Victor
Duboce and all the other officers of the regiment, looks from the fourth
page of the supplement, and on the fifth page is a figure of California
mourning her heroic dead, surrounded by the picture of all the gallant men
â who fell victims to the foemen's bullets or the deadly Philippine climate.
The text of the supplement is in keeping with the illustrations, including
as it does a history of the First California Ilegiment. with vivid descrip
tions of the battles in which it participated, together with a complete roster
of the regiment. The Call supplement is a journalistic triumph of which it
may well be proud and a souvenir of the war that will long be cherished by
the friends and admirers of the gallant First.
everything goes, especially when Johnnie
is California's own.
But noise is not all that went with the
crowd. There was a great display of
patriotism as well, me man was lonesome j

"THE CALL'S"
EARLY CALL
It was not the sharp notes of a bugle ,
which Hounded reveille for the boys of the |
First California Regiment yesterday. ]
Three blasts of the siren on the tug Fear- !
less awakened them from their slumber '
ami their dreams of home and sent them
pell-mell up the companion ways to the
upper clock. They found the tug along- i
side, laden with thousands of copies of j
The Call of yesterday morning, all kinds |
of fruit and a quantity of cigarettes,
which the thoughtfulness of The Call
management had sent them.
The men were hatless and coatless. and ;
made their appearance rubbing the slum- j
ber from their eyes. They were soon J
made acquainted with the mission of The j
Call reporters, and the work of transfer- |
ring the delicacies from the tug to the j
transport was soon under way. Their \
first consideration was the paper Itself. |
which told of the bravery of the men In
action, of their gallant officers and their I
heroic dead. Loud were the expressions
of approval at the accuracy of the data, :
the beauty of the Illustrations' and the
literary excellence of the text lights
gleamed through many cabin windows,
from which could be seen the soldier ;
boys, scanning the paper with interest.
The news Bection, containing the latest,
information regarding the plans for their i
reception and entertainment also caught !
their attention.
The cigunttes were particularly accept- I
able after the villainous Manila Cigars
the boys have been forced to use dur- !
ing their stay In the Philippines. Then ;
there were peaches, grapes, cantaloupes '
and other fruit, which were welcomed j
after the steady diet of stew, stew, stew, ;
against which they have such vigorous ;
protests to make. " The fruit, consisting !
of twenty cases, was the gift of a number !
of commission merchants, for whom The ,
Call acted as almoner.
Most treasured of all the articles car- j
ried to the Sherman was a huge American '
flag from Commodore John D. Spreckels
to Captain Read t>> replace one not suit- i
able lor the occasion. The flag floated j
on the breeze as the great transport
glided slowly into the harbor late in the j
day.
The thoughts of the volunteers recur
constantly to the friends and relatives
who have awaited their coming these
many days. There are anxious inquiries j
for mothers and sisters, and yet others
whose names are mentioned with diffi
dence. Shut off as the men have been
from civilization for so long a period, i
they feel that all persons know those .
who are near and dear to them.
The distribution of the articles was j
taken in hand by lieutenant Albert
Adler, who dispensed them among tiie i
men of the entire regiment. They re
peatedly volunteered the information that
"The Call is all right." When the Fear
less wus about to cast off the boys gave
three rousing cheers for The Call and
for its proprietor.
Not a moments delay occurred in de
livering the papers. They were the first
from the press and were sent to the Fear
less at Howard-street wharf without any
loss of time. Chief Engineer J. E. Dris
coll had steam up and once the papers
were on board the lines ' were cast off
and the race against time to the trans
port commenced. The signal to start was
immediately followed by the order to
"hook on." The huge tug ran along the
water front like a shadow, the wharves
disappearing from sight rapidly in the
gray mist of the morning. The run out
was made in less than forty-five minutes,
Engineer Drlscoll acting well his part.
Captain Marshall's daughters accom
panied him and found many friends
among the soldiers. They retailed to them
innocent gossip about mutual acquaint
ances, for' which the boys naturally crave
after their long absence from home.
CROWDS GATHER
AT THE WHARVES
"The world, his wife and all his children
are out to-day," remarked an old water
front habitue as he watched the crowds of
people scurrying toward the wharves from
early morning yesterday until the time ior
the marine display. â¢
"I have never s"en anything to equal it,"
continued this frequenter of the bilge
water district, "not even the reception
tendered to General Grant after his
famous trip around the world. It un
doubtedly eclipses that memorable occa
sion, both in point of numbers and in the
enthusiasm displayed by the spectators."
And, in fact, the water front was crowd r
ed as it never was crowded before. It la
safe to say that over 50,000 people gath-
ered ai the city front yesterday. Ten
thousand or more of these went out on
the Various excursion boats, while the rest
contented themselves by appropriating
points of vantage along the ends of the
piers and wherever they could get a foot
hold. The irrepressible small boy was seen
in large numbers everywhere and in any
old place. The rigging of deep water ships
lying at the docks was weighted down by
v mass of humanity, and no position, no
matter how perilous it may have been, out
had its quota of interested spectators.
The most astonishing feature of this im
mense gathering, which braved many dis
comforts to help in the hearty welcome to
the returning heroes, is that not a single
accident occurred to mar the enjoyment
of the day. Only a few minor cases were
treated at the Harbor Hospital, and of
these only two were taken from the. water
front. One individual, in the excess of
his enthusiasm and exuberance of spirit,
was brought in fainting, but rapidly re
covered. Another w;us treated for the
common complaint, "foreign body in the
eye," but the enemy was dislodged in
short order.

complete arrangements for participation
in the parade.
The executive committee has invited |
Colonel Duboce and his staff to occupy the
committee's grand stand at Kearny and
Market streets during the parade to-day.
Colonel Sullivan announced to the
League of the Cross Cadets that he de
sires a full attendance this morning. The
cadets will form at Steuart and Market
streets at half-past 10 o'clock sharp.
With the compliments of Tillmann &
Bendel, a hng of cigars will be laid be
side the plate of every soldier at their
breakfast this morning. The bag itself
will be a souvenir, and the firm extends a
hearty welcome and smoke to all of the
boys.. Should any soldier be inadvertent
ly overlooked he is requested to call at ]
the company's store, where all deficits
will be made good.
Among those who viewed the parade
from the decks of the flagship Fearless
was Mrs. James F. Smith, wife of Gen
eral Smith, the former commander of the j
First California Regiment. She was the
guest of Mr. and Mrs. John D. Spreckels.
At the Presidio the tents of the First
California Regiment have been beautifully
decorated by Mrs. Colonel Duboce, Mrs.
Major Hoxton, Mrs. Major Firth, Mrs.
George Clark and Miss Mabel Quatman.
Some of the Colorado boys assisted Id the
work and all the bunting was donated by
Hale Brothers, who also lent their head
decorator to assist. The flowers and
greenery were contributed by the Park
Commission. Colonel Duboce's tent is a I
dream of beauty.
SOLDIER AND
WIFE EMBRACE
Standing on the bridge of the Sherman
Colonel Victor D. Duboce watched with
strained eyes the approach of the Gov
ernor Markham. He had been told the
night before that his wife, whom hu had
not seen in more than a year, was to be
on the tug. The commander of the First
California, his glasses glued to his eyes,
saw a figure on the top of the pilot box,
and no longer than a trice was Colonel
Duboi-o on the Sherman's bridge. He de
scended in hasty steps to the upper deck
and on the starboard side waited until his
wife should reach hailing distance.
Mrs. Duboce as soon as she caught sight
of the transport began waving her hand
kerchief in ecstatic delight. Soldiers on
the Sherman who had never met nor seen
Mrs. Duboce wanted to know who she
was, for it. was apparent that this woman
had more than the ordinary interest iiv
the return of the volunteers.
Passing close to the transport the Mark
ham rounded her stern and brushed
alongside. Following the boat which car
ried his wife Colonel Duboce took up a
position within easy speaking range, and
the first words exchanged in fourteen
months between the soldier and his wife
were shouted over the water.
With snail-like pace the Sherman crept
down the bay until when well within the
straits the order was given to lower the
companion ladder. Hardly had it been
done wh'-n Mrs. Duboee mounted to the
transport deck and in an instant was in
her husband's arms. There were tears in
the woman's eyes; the soldier's face
beamed with Joy.
Governor Steunenberg 1 Appreciates.
Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho
caused a demonstration of patriotic feel
ing In the Orpheum last night which will
not soon be forgotten by those present.
He was the guest of the management. Hi 3
presence was announced from the stage
at the first intermission and the audience
demanded a speech.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the Gover
nor. "X was out on the bay to-day. I saw
that grand naval parade. I saw how Ban
Francisco opened her arms to her boys;
and excuse me if I am not able to say
very much. Never in my life have I seen
such a pageant or witnessed such whole
souled enthusiasm. I am here to meet
my own boys, who are due in a few days,
and to-day's reception has touched a cord
in my heart which I find has choked my
voice. The First California was the first
volunteer regiment to go to the front, and
the- manner of their home-coming is in
full accord with tbe gallant sacrifice they
made for their country and flag."

DEN>TES, Aug. 24.â T0-day's ces
sion of the Dreyfus oourt-mar
tial was marked by one of the
UtiaJ. was marked by one of the
most exciting scenes of the trial.
The proceedings opened with a
skirmish entirely favorable to the de
fense over Colonel Maurel, president of
the court-martial of 1894, who admitted
having read to the court one of the
secret documents which had not been
seen by the defense. He protested that
only one document was k looked at, al
tering that this sufficed to enable him
to form a conviction that could not be
shaken.
This protest made matters worse, be
cause, as M. Laborl pointed out, if he
perused one it was his bound duty to
peruse all.
Colonel Jouaust upheld Colonel Mau
rel in his refusal to indicate the nature
of the document he read, but M. La
bori announced that he would summon
Captain Freystatter, another member
of the tribunal of 1594, and get his ver
sion of what passed behind the backs
of the counsel for the defense. Colonel
Maurel felt his position keenly and
continually hesitated before replying to
Labori's questions.
All this, however, was only prelimin
ary to a fierce battle that ensued be
tween M. Labori and General Mercier.
the latter receiving reinforcements
from General Roget, General Gonse
and General de Boisdeffre, as well as
Invaluable assistance from Colonel
Jouaust himself.
M. Labori took General Mercier over
the whole ground of his previous depo
sition. This led to several sharp pas
sages at arms between the advocate
and Colonel Jouaust, who upheld Mer
cier in refusing to reply to several
questions which, in the general opinion
of those in the courtroom, were dis
tinctly pertinent.
Whenever General Mercier was cor
nered he declined to answer, and Col
onel Jouaust invariably supported him.
M. Labori protested most energetically.
His words and manner breathed the
deepest indignation, but the president
of the court-martial was inflexible.
The intervention of Generals Gonse.
Roget and De Boisdeffre and Major
Lauth, who in rapid succession
mounted the stage or arose in their
peats and interposed remarks, was very
exciting, and carried the spectators
along on a wave of breathlessness.
One after the other these officers, who
were to-day in full uniform, would
Jump up and cry "I demand to be
h^ard." and without further waiting
ascend the stairs of the platform and
b< gin a statement in support of a
brother officer. Sometimes four officers
were on the stage at the same time.
It was a marvelous display of military
clanni3hness. At one time a perfect
babel of voices reigned for several min
utes, until Colonel Jouaust intervened
and restored order.
M. Labori's cross-examination was
successful so far as it went, but Colo
nel Jouaust prevented him pressing
his advantage to the utmost. In fact.
Jouaust's hostile atttitude toward the
counsel for the defense then and during
the cross-examination of M. de Grand
maison evoked the severest criticism
on the part of the public present and
bodes ill for Dreyfus. Not only Colonel
Jouaust, but the other judges, dis
played considerable impatience during
Laborl's scathing cross-examination,
shifting restlessly in their seats and
drumming on the tables with the tips
of their fingers.

SORRY SHOWING MADE
BY FRENCH GENERALS
Laborl Causes Each in His Turn to Be
Placed in a Ridiculous
Light.
RRNNES. Aug. 24.â When the fourth
Fusion of the third week of the second
(rial by court-martial of Captain Alfred
Dreyfus, charged with treason, opened at
the Lycee here at 6:30 a. m. to-day Colonel
Jnuaust. president of the court, ordered
that tlve evidence given by M. Penot, a
friend of the late Colonel Sandherr. chief
r-f the Intelligence department, be read
by the clerk of the court. It was to the
effect that Colonel Sandherr said the
Dreyfus family offered him 150,000 franca
rÂ»n condition that he would clear Dreyfus.
If. Demange, for the defense, disposed
of the allegation by reading the actual
note written on the subject by Colonel
.Sar.ilherr. thereby proving that the col
onel's remarks had been distorted, Drey
fus' brothers having only said:
"We are convinced of the innocence of
our brother and -will spend our entire for
tune to discover the truth."
The testimony of the first witness of the
day, M. Llnolle, a former official of the
Government, was also in favor of Drey
fus afi it was in direct contradiction of
what M. de Brieul deposed yesterday In
regard to the alleged Intimacy of Dreyfus
with the German attache at the house of
M Bodson. a mutuaJ friend.
The president of the court then called
Colonel Maurel, who was president of the
I>reyfus court-martial in 189*. Complete
Bllence fell upon the court as the Infantry
sergeant who was acting usher conducted
Maurel to the witness bar. The colonel

the colonel a confession that the secret
dossier was communicated to the judges
of the court-martial of 1894 by Major Dv
Paty de Clam. This avowal produced a
sensation In court and Maurel's declara
tion that he read only one of the docu
ments did not affect the main fact, while
hie statement that the reading of the doc
ument had no effect upon him, as his
mind was already madÂ« up. was nullified
by his subsequent declaration that this
one document sufficed to convince him.
M. Labori then put a series of searching
questions to General Mercier with refer
ence to the communication of the secret
dossier for the court-martial, and his at
titude in 1594, and an Interesting scene
ensued. The general refused to reply to
all the questions, and there were sharp
passages at arms between counsel and
Colonel Jouaust, who upheld Mercier,
while the dialogue between the general
and M. Labori became acrimonious. Coun
sel became very heated and showed it in
his voice and gestures. The general, how
ever, troubled though his mind might be.
seldom departed from the callous de
meanor characteristic of him.
The lawyer made a strong point on the
part Esterhazy played. Mercier said he
did not know Esterhazy, and only saw
him onceâ at the Zola trial.
â¢"That is very interesting,' exclaimed
M. Labori, "but surely General Mercier
was present at the Esterhazy trial?"
The general replied that he was not
there and that he knew nothing about
the evidence in the Esterhazy proseeu
"What." cried M. Labori, "General Mer
cier, who was the chief accuser of Drey
fus, did not even follow the proceedings
in the Esterhazy trial?" .
A loud murmur of surprise and indig
nant comment came from the audience,
but Colonel Jouaust Immediately sup

This indignant protest caused a deep
sensation in court. Continuing. Dreyfus
proceeded to totally deny the story that
he had made a confession to Captain Le
brun-Renauld.
A number of other witnesses were
heard including M. Quesnay de Beaure

The refusal of Colonel Jouaust to per
mit General Roget to be recalled, which
occurred during the proceedings, was
looked upon as indicating a desire to
shorten the case.
Following are the more important pro
ceedings in detail: Â.
Colonel Ma-arel. who was president of
the Dreyfus court-marital of 1594, was
called He started by emphatically deny
ine that any communication, verbal or
written was made to the court during
the course of the trial. He said they only
knew the case from the documents in
the dossier and the testimony given. Then
the colonel, saying he only desired to
sneak of matters upon which his recol
lection was clear, proceeded to declare
that he had nothing to say -in regard to
the expert evidence of M. Charavay. M.
Trissonleres or M. Pelletier, but he added
that M Bertillon's testimony appealed to
the eves and minds of the judges. It had
been said that the judges did not under
stand it. but that was not true.
Regarding the evidence given at the
court-martial of 1594. witness said he con
sidered that Major Dv Paty de Clam had
only given the court a circumspect repe
tition of his report, while the late Lieu
tenant Colonel Henry's evidence would

ated. At the same time. Maurel contin

and protests were far from astonishing
the witness. They seemed perfectly nat
ural. The only letter handed to Colonel
Maurel during the course of the trial
w.i- not brought by Colonel Picquart.
The letter, moreover, was returned the
skine evening to the officer who
brought it.
Replying to M. Labori, Maurel said he
did not know General Mercier and had
not seen him since the trial until June
last.
M. Laboriâ Can Colonel Maurel tell us
to what he attributes the secret commu
nication of the dossier?
Colonel Maurelâ l have not the slightest
idea.
M Laboriâ -Can you tell the name of
the officer who brought you the letter?
Colonel Maurelâ lt was Dv Paty de
Clam.
M Laboriâ Were there many documents
In this secret dossier? Can you state what
they were?
Colonel Maurelâ l only saw one of them.
I did not luok at the others, because my
mind was already made up.
.M. Laboriâ Had the other members ol
the court also made up their minds?
Colonel Maurelâ Yes.
M Labori Can you tell us how, know
ing, as the Judge, that it was your duty
to seek conscientiously for information
and to expect sin. ere communications
from the public prosecutorâ that is to say,
communications setting forth all the
points in the case both for and against
the prisonerâ you could be of the opinion
that your mind was wholly made up after
reading a single document? U'rulonged
tion.J
I lonel Maurel said he failed to clearly
grasp the question, and M. I^aborl repeat
ed his query, whereupon the witness re
plied that he could not answer, because If
he did so he would have to speak of the
first document In the dossier, "which con
vinced the court of the prisoners guilt."
At this point M. Labori said he would
like to confront Colonel Maurel with Cap
tain Freystmeter, another of the judges
at tho court-martial of 1894. Freystmeter
was not present, and Colonel Maurel
promised to wait a few days and give the
captain an opportunity of attending.
A lively incident followed. M. Labori.
having asked leav.- to Interrogate General
Merrier, the Government commissary,
Major Carriere took occasion to remark
that while counsel had the right v. ask
questions he had no business to draw de
ductions, to which the lawyer deftly re
plied tli.it be had always acted with a full
Knowledge of the restrictions imposed
upon counsel and that he had no need of
lessons from Major Carriere and would
not accept them.
General Mercier was then recalled, and
it was noted that he had donned his uni
form for the first lime. The impression
thereby created was that the general, ex
pecting a hot cross-examination, thought
that his uniform would perhaps protect
him. M. Labori said he desired to kii"v,
if General Mercier admitted ordering Col
onel Maurel to communicate secret docu
ments to the court-martial of 1594.
Gdneral Mercier â I knew 1 did not have
the right to give formal orders to that
effect, but I Cave moral orders In a man
ner sufficiently eleir. (Sensation.)
counsel proceeded to closely question
the general, referring to the "Dixi" arti
cle in the Libre Parole. Mercier replied
that he was so accustomed to violence
from the press that he paid no attention
to that article.
Replying to further questions, the gene
ral said that, when Dreyfus was arrested,
ho knew of no other proof against Drey
fus than the bordereau. There were,
therefore, only suspicions, but it was
urgently necessary not to lose time in ar
resting him in order to stop the treason
able practices.
M. Labori here asked Colonel Jouaust
to secure the evidence of M. Papilland,
editor of the Libre Parole, In regard to
the "dixi" letter, in which the name of
Dreyfus was disclosed as that of the of
ficer arrested for espionage. As Colonel
Jouaust hesitated, M. Labori Insisted up-<
on the necessity for an examination of
Papilland. "In order to reach the truth
I am seeking for."
"The whole responsibility for this ease,"
counsel added, "I believe realiy rests up
on the late Lieutenant Colonel Henry and
Major Dv Patj- de Clam."
Resuming his examination of General
Mercior, M. Labori asked him several
questions as to why he at first ascribed
the date of the bordereau to the month
of April. General Mercier said that in
1894 he was only acquainted with the
general reasons which existed for be
lieving Dreyfus guilty and had not paid
much attention to the details.
The general refused to reply to many
of the questions. For Instance, he de"
cllned to say whether he had examined
the proofs against Dreyfus.
M. Laboriâ ln short you consider it in
the nature of a sensational move to have
Dreyfus persecuted and sentenced. Did
you examine previously the charges
against Dreyfus?
General Mercier â I only examined the
nature of the documents betraj-ed.
M. Laboriâ Was !t not necessary for
that purpose to fix the date or the
i bordereau?
General Mercierâ l do not think so.
Further. I declare that Labori is dis
cussing the whole trial of 1894. That may
have seme Interest from an historical
point of view. But since the Court of
Cassation quashed the judgment it seems
to me that it is not for us now to revert
to the various features of that trial.
M. Labori pointed out the contra
dictions in the evidence of officers of the
headquarters staff regarding the im
portance of the contents of the bordereau,
and asked General Mercier where Drey
fus could have obtained particulars about
the automatic brake.
The general hotly objected to being
asked to repeat his evidence, and M. La
in.ri equally warmly said: "I am only
asking for definite statements."
General Mercier then said he thought
| Dreyfus might have had cognizance of the
- brake at Bourges. adding, "in anj- event
he had a better chance to obtain such
knowledge than Esterhazy could possibly
have had."
M. Labori â General Mercier says Drey
j fus might have had cognizance, I desire
Ito emphasize that expression. We shall
now prove Dreyfus could not have cog
nizance of the brake.
Counsel proceeded to demonstrate how
rigorouslj* the secret of the construction
of the brake was guarded and asked why,
in 1894. the charge? regarding the Robin
melenlte shells were not dwelt upon.
General Mercierâ That rises on thft sim
ple fact that it was not known in 1896 or
1897 that information on the subject was
being divulged.
The nassagep-at-arms between M. La
bori and General Mercier were followed
with the keenest interest. Both men were
wary and mutually suspicious of each
other, and there was considerable acer
bity. Colonel Jouaust at times finding it
difficult to prevent the discussion from
wandering outside legal paths.
Continuing, M. Labor! asked why Gen
eral Mercler did not have a report pre
pared regarding the confessions Dreyfus
Is alleged to have made to Captain Le
brun-Renaud. : .y
Mercier â The question of the confessions
was of no chance, as a revision of the case
seemed impossible.
M. Laboriâ What does General Mercier
think of Ksterhazy and the part he
played? "-'â¢:;
General Mercierâ l do not know Ester
hazy and I do not think about him at all.
M. Laboriâ Did he know you at his trial
In ISSS?
General Mercierâ No.
Colonel Jouaustâ Mercier was
not Minister or War then.
M. Laboriâ This is most interesting .
General Mercler declares he knows noth
ing of the trial of 1898.
General Mercierâ know nothing of it.
I leave that to the court-martial which
tried Esterhazy. I have only to 'answer
in court for my acts and I refuse you the
right to question me about my thoughts.
[Sensation.
Colonel Jouaust, addressing M. Labor!,
said: "You are reverting to the evidence
of General Mercier?"
M. Laboriâ My object in interrogating
the witness is to revert to his evidence.
General Merclerâ l protest against the
word "interrogatory," for I am not a
prisoner.
(Noteâ "lnterrogatory" in French law
generally applies to the examination of an
accused person by a magistrate.)
M. Laboriâ lt is not a question of inter
rogatory. I used the word in the most
respectful sense. Will General Mercier
say what he means by the charge pre
ferred against the partisans of Dreyfus
of having spent 35.000,000 francs? What
was the sum used for? The amount is sim
ply ridiculous.
General Merclerâ l might Just as well
ask you. (Sensation.)
M. Laboriâ Do you mean to suggest that
it was spent in advertising and in buying
consciences?
General Mercierâ l say nothing what
ever.
Counsel next wished to know why the
bordereau was communicated to the court
martial of 1594. when it was considered
impossible to show the other documents
of the secret dossier. .
General Mercierâ Because the bordereau 1
was not dated nor signed, and its place
of origin could be concealed.
M. Labori pointed out that the place of I
origin had been mentioned in court, and i
then asked for explanations in regard to
the perpetration of the 1894 forgery.
The cross-examination of General Mer
cier became more and more heated and
so rapid that it was difficult to follow,
and many of the answers were confusing.
As the questions of counsel touched
upon the secret dossier and a certain doc
ument In blue pencil. General Gonse. Gen- '
eral Roget. M. Grlbelin and Major Lauth I
also participated in the discussion, which
at last degenerated into wrangle. The
Government commissary, Major Carriere,
protested against such discussion, and
Colonel Jouaust ordered silence. The com
missary said an attempt was being made
to show there was a fresh forgery, which
was used for purposes of comparisons, to
which M. Labori retorted that Major Car
riere was mistaken. The tendency of these
cross-examinations, he added, was only to
demonstrate the truth.
Major Lauth said he believed a clew to
the blue pencil document existed before
the trial of 1594.
M. Labori asked why, in that case, it
was not produced at the trial, since it in
criminated the prisoner?
General Mercier said he did not know of
this clew, and Major Lauth disclaimed all
responsibility in the matter, as he was
not connected with the preliminary in
quiry. General Gonse said the document
had been In the possession of Colonel
Sandherr (Sensation.), and it was by him
placed in the secret dossier for compari
son with other papers. â¢
M. Labori asked for explanations in re
gard to the commentary on the secret
dossier, and General Mercier admitted he
destroyed it in 1394.
General Gonse, who was questioned on
the same subject, declared that it was by
order of General de Boisdeffre that he re
turned the commentary to General Mer
cier.
After further questions Mercier said
the Panlzzardi telegram was not commu
nicated to the court-martial In 1594. He
was ordered by General de Boisdeffre not
to 1 include it in the secret dossier. (Sen
sation.)
Counsel next discussed the three-page
document claiming that the false render
ing of the Panizzardi telegram was to
make it point directly to Dreyfus as the
traitor.
Mercier asked to be allowed to converse
with General Chanoine before attempting
to explain. General Chanoine thereupon
advanced and explained about the docu
ment, which had been handed him by
General Mercier. He said he noticed in
accuracies in it and resolved not to use It.
Witness, however, had been carried away
in testifying and read a page of the docu
ment, and it was after a friendly conver
sation with Maitre Labori that he read
the entire document in court, at General
Mercier's request, and returned him the
document. , â¢ -' ; -.' i;;
General Mercier acknowledged the accu
racy of General Chanoine s statement,
adding that it was Colonel Dv Paty de
Clam who gave him the document. (Sen
sation.)
Counsel had the document re-read, and
referred to the two versions of two tele
grams of November 2. one designating
Dreyfus as communicating documents to
Germany, M. Labori pointing out that M.
Pateologue of the Foreign Office denied
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had i
communicated this version, and asked I
why General : . Mercier had received It
through Dv Paty de Clam
At this juncture General Roget mounted
the platform and expressed surprise at
this* "idle controversy being resumed."
(Cries qf "Oh! Oh!")
The general asked . that Major Maton,
who assisted in deciphering the telegram,
be called, and counsel protested against
the application of the word "idle" to any
questions he thought proper to ask.
?. General Chanoine said he communicat
ed the document to General Roget. while
enjoining absolute privacy on the subject.
When asked if he a<Â»epted responsibility
for the document General Chanoine re
plied in the affirmative, adding, however,
the admission that he had made a mis

CRIME ATJEDWOOD
Mrs. Lillie Stalter the Victim of
the Rage of a Disappointed
Suitor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 24.âA double
tragedy.was enacted in this city early
this evening â when a love and liquor
crazed man killed the woman who re
fused his offer of marriage, and.then
himself. The tragedy occurred at the
home of Mrs. Titus on Main street.
This morning Mrs. Titus and her
daughter, Mrs. Lillie Stalter,' ' accom
panied by Jerome Turner, a boarder at
their home, visited San Francisco, to
see the decorations. After spending
some time in the city the party con
cluded to take a trip to Alvarado to
visit Mrs. Titus' son. On the ferry
boat both ladies were startled by Tur
ner suddenly proposing marriage' to
Mrs. Stalter. His suit was indignantly"
rejected by both mother and daughter.
On arriving in Oakland they took the
first train to San Francisco, leaving
Turner in Oakland, where he spent a
great portion of the day in saloons
! drinking.
When Mrs. Titus and her daughter
returned to this city Turner came on
! the same train. He took a carriage at
j the station and reached the Titus res
idence in advance of the ladies.
When they entered the house they
were confronted by Turner who bran-
I dished a pistol and shouted: "Now I've
i got you!" He fired two shots at the
! head of Mrs. Stalter, who dropped to
the floor. Mrs, Titus grappled with him
to save herself and, crying â¢ for help,
struggled to the front door and ran out
into the street screaming murder. Im
mediately another shot was heard and
i Turner dropped at the door with a bul
| let in his brain. Persons who hurried
I to the scene of the shooting found Tur
i ncr and his victim breathing their
I last.
Mrs. Stalter was 33, years old and a
! native of this city. She was recently
! divorced. Turner likewise was married
j before, but was divorced by his wife
for cruelty. The latter is now married
to a prominent business man.
The murderer was about 50 years of
' age and, through his dissolute habits,
was a social outcast. Mrs. Stalter was
well known and highly esteemed.

ought to take no notice of the document
in question. , Â
Dreyfus here gave a detailed story or
how he employed his time at Bourges
from October, 1886, to February. 1890. He
said that as he was preparing for his ex
amination he had no time to go to cafes
or to think of anything outside of his dv
ties. This was contrary to General Mer
cier's assertion that he could have learned
that secret of the pneumatic brake there.
The prisoner said: "â, '
"I v.-;is promoted captain September 12,
ISS9, and remained at Bourges from Octo
ber 1689, to February, 1890, when the writ
ten examination at the military college
began. I was then called to Paris, ob
tained two" months' leave and was married
in April. I spent four months at Bourges.
As 1 was preparing for examination 1 Had
no time to go to cafes or to think of any
thing outside of my duties."
General Risbourg, who was commander
of the Republican Guard in Paris in 1894,
was the next witness. He described the
scene with Captain Lebrun-Renaud,
when the witness learned of Dreyfus' al
leged confessions to Captain Lebrun-
Renaud, the day after the prisoner's deg
radation. In conclusion General Risbours
eulogized the service of Captain Lebrun- j
Renaud and said before the incident of
the confession there was nothing against
him. He was an excellent officer, a good
comrade and incapable of injuring any
one. â â  :/.
After being asked the usual questions
Dreyfus protested against General Ris
bourg's evidence.
"I am surprised," the prisoner said,
"that he. Captain Lebrun-Renaud, could
have made the statements attributed to
him. On the way from the prison of La
Sante Captain Lebrun-Renaud shook
hands with me, a fact which is in contra
diction of his statement. Besides, when
such a terrible charge has been hanging
over a man, who has resisted it for five
years, witnesses, should not come here
merely to speak their beliefs but ought
to bring proofs, positive proofs. Other
wise I am completely nonplused as to
how I can reply. (Sensation.)
Dreyfus then proceeded to give the true
version of his words on the occasion of
the alleged confession and dwelt on his
protestations of innocence to Dv Paty do
Clam. The prisoner's remarks deeply
impressed his hearers.
At the request of Demange, General
Mercier was recalled and asked to ex
plain why, having sent Dv Paty de Clam
to Dreyfus to discover the amount of
the injury Dreyfus had done, he had not
followed up his investigations.
Mercierâl did not feel called upon to
do so.
The prisoner again protested that the
inquiry ought to be followed up, "because
it would have . served to destroy the
fiction of a confession, to which such im
portance was now attached." (Sensation.)
r M. Duvereine, special commissary of
the Minister of War. deposed that Colo
nel Picquart was ordered to have Ester
hazy watched. M. Duvereine saw Ester
hazy enter the German Embassy October
23. 1597 He stayed there an hour and
drove to the Credit Foncier. where he
went to the office of La Patrie.
M. LaboriâWhat does General Roget
think of the part played by Esterhazy?
General Rogetâl have said that the
part played by Esterhazy escaped me
completely.
M. LaboriâGeneral Roget,. however,
spoke of the syndicate as though It was
a public institution.
General RogetâExactly: it. is a public
institution. Everybody talks of it.
M. LaboriâBut General Roget men
tioned an offer of 600,000 francs to Ester
hazy. I insist upon asking General Roget
what he thinks of Esterhazy's visit to I
Colonel. Schwarzkoppen (the German mil
itary attache) October 23, 1597. the same
day as the interview in Mount Souris
Park, a visit during the course of which
It is known Esterhazy threatened to com
mit suicide if the German military at
tache refused to declare that he, Ester
hazy, was not the author of the borde-
General Rogetâlt is not for me to say
what I think of it.: - â¢
M. Labori, resuming his seat, said:"
"Very good." (Loud and prolonged laugh
ter )
Colonel Fleur, retired, testified to the al
leged inaccuracies in Cordier's evidence
before the Court of Cassation. Cordier
told the witness that the dismissal of him
self and Coloned Sandherr was the be
ginning of a Jewish revenge, and added
that the Jews had influenced General de
Boisdeffre.
â Cordier also said that he had not doubt
ed the guilt of Dreyfus. The witness
dramatically added:
â¢ 'â¢What was my stupefaction when, later,
I heard Colonel Cordier express ideas dia
metrically opposite to those he expressed
Â°Proceedlng. Colonel Fleur repeated the
tattle tending to incriminate Dreyfus,
when M. Demange interrupted him, say
ing- "This is nothing but gossip."
Counsel insisted that General Roget be
recalled to explain certain inconsistencies,
but Colonel Jouaust refused to recall the
general, and he also refused the request
of General Roget to be allowed to speak.

BUREAU HAS OBTAINED
EVIDENCE FOR DREYFUS
SEATTLE, Aug. 84.â M. Lenn Bureau,
the private secretary of Maitre Labor!,
the leading counsel for Dreyfus, who has
been in Seattle visiting the French Vice
Consul, Dr. Monod, has left for Paris.
In an interview M. Bureau admitted
f^r the first time that his crip to tho
Northwest was for the purpose-^of secur
ing information of great value tQ prey-
He has obtained it and this accelerates
his desire to reach home without loss of
time. "I have been to the Great Slave
Lake in the Northwest Territory," saM
M. Bureau, "after information connecter!
with the Dreyfus case. I hope to reach
Paris in time to hand it over to Labori
before the case closes, but even if I do
not it will still be of value. I am unable
to state th.< exact nature of the informa
tion I obtained, for you know we mun
guard against every contingency in tho
case, future as well as present.
"The impression that there was a con
spiracy among the high army officers
against Dreyfus prior to the time he was
condemned is not in conformity with our
belief and contention. It is true that th-j
proceedings by which he was degraded
were illegal, but wo do not think that an\
deep-dyed conspiracy has been hatched
against him. It was a case of an inno
cent man being prosecuted while the real
criminal was in the background."

EXCLUSION IS TEMPORARY.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24.â The State De
partment does not apprehend that any
international complications will arise from
General Otis' action in excluding Chinese
from the Philippines, as this is said tn be
only a temporary military expedient, leav
ing the general question to be determined
by Congress.
Moreover, it seems that the. exclusion
comes about through the adoption of
the military regulations, following
line of the United States laws and
not by the detailed enforcement of
the United States statutes relating to
Chinese exclusion. "\Vhile the same end
attained, yet the distinction is. made thnt
Congress is the only body which can ap
ply a L'nited States law to the Philippines,
although the military authorities ' may
adopt temporary steps conforming to
these laws.

WELCOME FOR THE BRAVE.
ONCE more we express the voice ol the people
r:iia in a welcome to our victorious
teers. Yesterday, with the rinest marine
witnessed on the Pacific Coast, they were
â¢ transport steamed up the
bay. This morning, with the cheering of a proud
i.nd rejoicing people, they will be welcomed as they
h through the streets.
The Governor would not ordain a single public
holiday for the reception of the heroes, but the people
know how to make holidays for themselves. How
much business was done in San Francisco yester
ilow much will be done to-day? The Gov
ern'>r's pettiness will have no other effect than that of
confusing the business of two days, and of keeping a
large number of working men and women at their
where they had little or nothing to do because
all the patrons of trade had gone to welcome the vol
::e great throngs who line the streets and give
their heart's voice in a roar of cheering, rolling in
unbroken volume from the ferry depot to Van Ness
avenue, the Governor's littleness will be of no mo
â¢ They will have ordained a holiday by the
of the popular will, and it will be one of the
: | ius in our annals.
It is not worth while to urge anew that the wel
come of the volunteers be accompanied by every
manifestation of public rejoicing. The people can
be counted on to look out for that. The elaborate
decorations of the streets along the line of march will
render that part of the city only a little more brilliant
and adorned than other portions. All over town
banners are living, and "Welcome" meets the eye on
every side
rtlay The Call blazoned upon the first page of
its souvenir edition, "California's Glory Is Her Vic
torious Returning Sons." It is in that sentiment the
I-eople will receive them to-day. The heroic volun-
Kcr^ have attested to the world the valor and the loy
alty of Californians in war. and it is now for those
who have remained at home to attest the admiration
and the love with which the valiant and the loyal are
regarded by their fel!ow-citi?ens.
According to the press dispatches Emperor Wil
liam, in refusing to allow the captain of the Meteor
to sail Sir Thomas Lipton'a yacht against the Co
lumbia, assigned no reason. That is the beauty of
majesty â you don't have to assign reasons.
Though the municipal conventions have been al
most lost to sight in the excitement of the reception,
i: i^ to be hoped they will do nothing that will prove
near to t'ne people in the end.
OUR SOUVENIR EDITION.
WITH more than ordinary satisfaction The Call
directs attention this morning to the superb
souvenir edition published yesterdiy in honor
of the arrival of the volunteers. It is unquestionably
the most artistic specimen of newspaper work on a
large scale ever produced on the Pacific Coast, and
lias had no superior anywhere.
In preparing the souvenir designed to recount and
to illustrate the deeds of our heroes in the Philip
pines The Call determined to achieve a supplement
which would need no resort to gaudy colors to render
it attractive. Each picture is the work of a true art
ist, and the mechanical reproduction is faultless.
(Jreat care was taken with the portraits of the officers
; t nd of the brave men who died in the service, and in
each case a good picture and a true likeness is given.
The literary features of the number are not inferior
to the illustrations. It constitutes a compendium of
the regiment and its service during the war. A com
plete roster of the regiment and of the two batteries,
Battery A from this city and Battery D from Los
Angeles, are given, as is also a complete list of those
who fell in battle or died in hospitals. The story of
the principal events connected with the service of the
regiment is told with graphic fidelity, and the num
ber as a whole will be accounted an important con
tribution to the record of the war with Spain and the
military history of California.
It is worth noting in this connection that the pub
lication of the souvenir was on time, notwithstanding
the fact of the arrival of the transport a day sooner
than was expected. The Call not. only does the right
thing in the right way, but does it at the right time.
IMPERIALISM NOT INDORSED.
THE three-ringed circus in politics which Mr.
Bryan is running has so occupied the amuse- ,
ment-loving public that due attention has not j
| been paid to the exceeding conservatism of the Re- j
j pubiican party on the issue of imperialism. Notwith- j
I standing the somewhat frenzied utterances of Gov- j
j ernor Roosevelt, who has gone in with all the youth
ful enthusiasm of a freshman at a college rush, or the
| unthinking muscular zeal of an amateur at football,
j the Republicans have shown great calmness and self- i
I control. The three leading State conventions of the
i party already held, in Kentucky, Ohio and lowa, have
1 emitted entirely any indorsement of expansion and
' imperialism. They ail indorse any effort to establish
civil stability in Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines,
but there they stop. This position is entirely conser
vative, and is, in effect, an attitude of waiting for the
I action of Congress, which must at the next session ,
! declare a policy on which the party will go into next ;
j j ear's campaign. It is fortunate, because no member i
i of Congress can plead imperial pressure from his party '
!at home. The members will meet in an impartial
I mind to do their American duty and so solve the
' i?sue as not to impair our institutions and tarnish the
true fame of the republic. One thing is significant in
conventionsâ the name of Lincoln was invoked
and conjured with to an extent unknown in recent j
. years. This is a good indication. When a party is
willing to sit quietly down with the memory and his- I
tory of its founders and fathers, it is in a mood to rv
new its natal inspirations and strive for the heights
on which its builders stood.
Just now Republican leaders can do their party and
their country no better service than by studying and
the profoundly patriotic and philo
lical view? of Lincoln and his exegesis of the prin
ciples of our government It is a wonderful testimony
resight of the founders of the party that
its first platform, in every expression of principle,
' might serve to-day as a statement upon which to go
I into a campaign in defense of the institutions in whose
: rescue from destruction and forgetfulness it was !
framed.
As the party now and next year gets nearer to the
cradle in which its mewling infancy so suddenly grew
to manly strength, its chances for another lease of
popular confidence improve.
Our word goes to it.s representatives throughout the
Union to stand by its primordial principles and refuse
Ito accept greed as its motive, though it may be
j wrapped in the flag and consecrated by the spume of
: pseudo patriots.
The rights of man. government by consent of the
j governed, the equality of all before the law. were the
high legend written uponthebattle standard of Lincoln
Republicanism. Let that legend shine out like the stars
and the nation will turn to it, away from all the coun- â â 
; tcrfeit enthusiasm and forged pretense of the crowd of
' grub-hunters and small tinkers who have no use for
the party unless it can stuff their bellies or their ;
â  purses.
When Dr. Cohn, quarantine officer of the State
Board of Health, was refused permission to board j
the steamer Doric he took the names of the Federal
inspectors who barred his passage. The doctor j
should be careful. Had there been some fearful dis
ease aboard he might have taken that.
Tom Reed has a right of course to attend to pri- I
vate business for the next few years, or for the rest '
of his life, if he choose; but all the same his retire- j
ment from Congress will be very much like taking ;
! Hamlet out of the play and leaving the stage to the
ghost and the supes.
It is said there was not a single professional poli
tician in the convention that nominated the anti-
Goebel Democratic ticket in Kentucky, and if it be =o
it is safe to say the revolt is truly that of the better
element of the party.
THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
r~^ HAIRMAX KELLOGG, in his address to the.
( Republican municipal convention on Wedncs-
day, clearly set forth the nature of the issues
before the people in the campaign, and the respon
sibilities which rest upon Republicans in confronting
them.
"In November," as the chairman said, "there will
be held the most important municipal election which
has ever taken place in this imperial city of San Fran
cisco." Government under the new charter corre
sponds in point of time with the opening of a new
era in politics by the operation of a primary law
which has at one sweep cleared the city of the domi
nation of ward bosses, and a new era in municipal
development caused by the double effect of commer
cial expansion and the increased interest of progres
sive citizens in public affairs.
To meet this issue fairly and to assure Republican
success at the polls the chairman said: "We must
nominate this year a good ticket throughout. We
have no right to .expect any weakness in our oppo
nents. They/ have a representative convention and
will doubtless nominate respectable candidates." The
wisdom expressed in the words is doubtless fully ap
preciated by the delegates to the convention. This
is not to be a "yellow dog year" by any means. The
party that wins in the election will do so by the
merit of its platform and the personal worth of its
candidates.
The chairman laid due stress upon the importance
of nominating able and public-spirited men for the
office of Supervisor, as well as naming a leader of
sterling worth for the mayoralty. On that point his
words are impressive: "There should be no higher
honor than membership in a body which shapes the
course of a large and rapidly growing city of the
United States. The citizen of London is almost as
proud of a seat in his County Council as in the House
of Commons, and scores of other European cities are
celebrated for the business-like administration of their
municipal affairs. Let us avail ourselves of our op
portunity and make our Board of Supervisors worthy
of the city in which we live, and worthy of the repub
lican institutions, which, in spite of many disappoint
ments, we yet know to be the best on earth."
From the applause with which all snlient points of
the address were greeted it is evident the convention
is in full harmony with the aspirations expressed by
the chairman. The spirit that animates the delegates
is one of civic patriotism and of loyalty to the high
est ideals of Republicanism. It remains to be seen
how far they will be able to accomplish that which
they design. In order that they may do so it will be
necessary for business men to be willing to under
take the severe duties of municipal offices. If men
whom the party would delight to honor decline to
become candidates, of course the convention will be
compelled to have recourse to men of less leadership
and eminence in the community, and no one will be
to blame save the men who have shirked their po
litical duty to the city.
Fortunately, there is no reason visible at the pres
ent outlook for fearing the result. The better class
of citizens are now awake to the importance of the
issues of the time and have shown at the primaries a

willingness to attend to politics as well as to business..
The prospects are therefore good, and we may con
fidently expect of the convention a ticket and a
county committee which will merit and have the sup
port not only of all good Republicans but of inde
pendent voters.
We note that one of the enterprising (?) evening
journals sent four of its reportorial staff out to the
transport on a "fleet-footed" tug. This is evidently
a new departure in tug-building.
Yesterday the people on land shouted welcome for
the boys in the transport, and to-day the people in
transport will shout for the boys on land.
THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH AND
THE SIREN.
YESTERDAY the people of San Francisco had
a striking illustration of the difference between
the swift, silent, scientific methods of legiti
mate journalism and the noisy and discordant pre
tensions of yellow journalism. In obtaining by wire
less telegraphy the first report of the arrival of the
Sherman oft the Golden Gate The Call showed the
people how enterprising journalism profits by every
advance in science* to increase its facilities as a gath
erer and disseminator of news; while in the screech
of its siren the Examiner showed how a faker in
journalism brings mechanism to aid its howling over
discomfiture.
The Call of course does not claim to have been the
first to make use of wireless telegraphy. The system
has been operated off the coast of England during the
past summer, and similar experiments more or less
successful have been made in many parts of Europe
and in the Eastern States. The merit of the feat of
The Call lies in the fact that it was the first use of
wireless telegraphy in practical journalism; the first
time the new marvel of science has enabled enter
prise to accomplish a scoop over slow-going con
temporaries.
The result was not attained without much work in
the way of preliminary experimenting. For six weeks
expert electricians in the service of The Call were
planning, testing and working patiently to devise a
wireless telegraph system that could be relied on
when the emergency called for its use. In the mean
time yellow journalism was polishing up an old
second-hand siren and putting new screech pipes
into the throttle of it.
At last the great day came. Through a thick haze
upon the sea the Sherman, with California's heroes
aboard, loomed upon the sight of the watchers, and
instantly the wireless message of glad tidings was
flashed to the Cliff House, and then to The Call
office, and from there given to a rejoicing city. The
system had proven to be of practical value to live
journalism, and it was a happy coincidence that en
abled its first service to be that of announcing the ar
rival of the California Volunteers home from the
war.
In this contrast between the wireless telegraph and
the siren the public has an epitome of all the thou
sand contrasts between the journalism of enterprise
and the journalism of fakes. The one gathers news,
learns from science how to accomplish new marvels
of success and applies the learning promptly to the
exigencies of the day; while the other fakes some
thing that â will make a noise out of old junk
shops and attracts attention to itself by making more
racket than a pig under a gate.
With the passing of the holiday the screeching of
the Examiner's siren will cease for a time at least,
but the wireless telegraphy of The Call will go on *o
still greater accomplishments, for the noise of fakers
is but for a day, while the enterprises of science are
for all time.
Bryan's opponents in the Democratic party may
figure out in back rooms how to beat him, but when
it comes before an open convention they are not in
evidence, and he has everything his own way.
Even the jingoes will admit it is better to have our
heroes at home than to have them across the ocean
holding down the Filipinos.
THE CRISIS IN SAMSAH BASIN.
I Â» ROM all parts of the Orient come reports oi
i strife and strikes and disturbances because the
* ancient and orderly ways of the people are bein^
disturbed by the introduction of the machinery of our
Western civilization. The jinrikisha men are in re
volt in Japan against electric cars, the punkah workers
in India are bewailing the introduction of the electric
fan, and in China the coolies are protesting against
the opening of a new port in Samsah basin, north of
Foochow, because it will enable ships to receive at
that port a large quantity of freight now carried over
land.
According to the Hongkong Press the coolies em
ployed in carrying the products of the Samsah dis
trict to Foochow number, many thousands, and when
the port was virtually opened by the arrival of the
first steamer they feared their occupation would he
gone, and in the old approved way went in for more
or less violent obstruction. On her first trip the
steamer came back empty and reported that coolies
could not be obtained to put the tea on board. Later
on Mr. Commissioner Tanner visited the port, and
on her next trip the steamer brought back cargo, and
everything appeared to be going on all right. Yester
day an "express" was sent out which stated.
"Dispatches for the steamship Hailan is to be post
poned until further notice. Kwong Shun Tsiang
Company, CtlU Ting, agent." Further inquiry elicited
the reply, "Have makee loosum too muchee. How
can 5 "
So for the time being the port of Santu, in the
Samsah basin, is closed. Electric fans wave in the
palaces of Indian Rajahs and electric cars carry pas
sengers through romantic Japan, but in China the
coolie for a time holds his own. much to the regret
not only of the European business men of that sec
tion, but of the pleasure-lovers, for the Hongkong
Press says sadly: "The Samsah basin is described as
being a miniature inland Sea of Japan, and residents
here were looking forward to a nice little steamer
trip with shooting and fishing thrown in."
Senator Tillman's statement that Boston is the cen
ter of all devilment and is the cause of all the strife
between whites and blacks in South Carolina is not
true to the facts, but it is true to his reputation.
A. sad report comes from the East that one of the
notable features of the camp-meetings in that section
this summer has been the number of counterfeit half
dollars found in the contribution boxes. .
Croker's declaration that Bryan is a great states
man may not have much effect on national politics,
but the next time Tammany gives a $10 banquet the
Platte River orator will be there.
If the "Half-Million Club" can*be revived in time
it could make a ten-strike now and close up its
career brilliantly by taking a census of the city be
fore Saturday night.
CANNON THAT GUARD AGAINST TORNADOES
GUNS IN POSITION TO SHOOT CYCLONES.
A WESTERN man has devised the tornado guard, shown in the Illustration,
which he asserts Is full protection against such unwelcome visitors. It
consists of a wooden framework, covered with strips of copper and lightning
rods. Insulated wires are run to the cannon placed in front of the guard,
and they are discharged by means of electric sparks conveyed by lightning ar
resters. The discharge of the cannon stops the whirling motion and robs a
straight wind of its destructive force.
Lafcadio Hearn's Feat.
"Twenty years ago I.afeadio Hearn was
a reporter "on the staff of a Cincinnati
newspaper which I was directing. He
came fromâ no man knew where. He was
a tiny follow physically, and as myopic
as a bat. He knew nothing about news,
but he could write a 'story' that was as
polished and as full of color as if it had
come from the pen of Gautier himself.
Despite his physique, he was as coura
geous as a lion, and there was no as
signment of peril that he would not bid
for avidly. I remember that one day a
famous steeple climber was going to
scale the spire of the cathedral to repair
the cross that topped the spire 200 feet
above the sidewalk. It was a feat that
all other steeple climbers had balked at,
but this fellow was the master of his
trade and accepted the contract. The
afternoon he first scaled the spire thou
sands of people watched him breathlessly
as he slowly made his way up the out
side of the "steeple, fixing his ropes and
f.'uiholds as he went. Of course, he was
in. rvlewed, and he said boastingly that
the task was bo easy that he could just
as well carry a man up on his back. That
noon Hearn came to me and said timidly
that he had read of the steeple climber's
offer, and he would be glad to ascend
the spire on his back. I was amazed, and
tried to point out to Hearn the peril of
the thing. He would not listen. Finally,
my desire to -get a "good story' overcame
my scruples, and I told Hearn I'd ar
range the matter with the steeple
climber. I thought the latter was mak
ing a huge bluff f'>r business and adver
tising ends, but I was mistaken. He was
as zealous as Hearn. Well, 1 brought the
two together. They arranged their end
of the feat, and I washed my hands of
further responsibility for either the stee
ple climbers or Hearn's safety.
"At the appointed time Hearn mounted
the steeple climber's shoulders, and the
dizzy journey began. Tens of thousands
of people watched the foolhardy pair. At
last the cross was reached, and Hearn
Uft his pÂ«reh on the climber's shoulders.
The steeple .lark swarmed up the cross
and stood on his head on the apex of it.
The mob in the streets below cheered the
daring fellow, but he was so high up in
the air that the cheers were Inaudible.
The two men returned to the ground
safely. Hearn came back to the office and
sat down and wrote two columns of a
Btory describing his sensations, and the
glories of the view he had obtained from
the steeple top. It was literature, this
Btory, and it is regrettable that it has
been lost in the obscurity of a forgotten
newspaper. Such a glowing description
of a i-ity seen from a great heignt I never
;â¢ ad before or sinco. The most interesting
thing about it to me was the fact that
Hearn couldn't see five feet beyond the
tip "f his nose, so myopic was he."â The
Verdict.
Shall We Keep the Philippines?
VisaJia Times.
The Snn Francisco Call is interviewing
the soldiers who are now arriving from
the Philippines and their testimony will
be hard to overcome by the imperialists
who are holding up the vast profits to
i be made by the alleged trade we are to
I have with that country when we whip the
insurgents into a nroper regard for our
< particular brand of foreign libei cy.
It is asserted that white men cannot
â  labor In the Philippines and that the
â  work is nearly all done by Chinese coolies.
The land is owned by the church and
there is no opportunity to get hold of it
at a prire that will make it an object to
American Investors. The Idea of this
country making money trading with a
people who are able to earn only about
K. cents a day is absurd, and something
else will have to be found to make the

One of the bravest, as well as one of the

A story comes from Oklahoma which
shows that a clergyman may have a

Rev. Mr. Newby, new pastor of the

the question, "How many of you have

"Good!" said the preacher. "Now, how

there is no second chapter of Jude, and,
of course, no matter how they may at

PIPER AND CLAYTON-M. S., City.
At the election held November 5, 1872,
Charles Clayton and W. A. Piper were
candidates for Representatives to Con
gress from the First District of Califor
nia. The vote for Clayton was 11,938 and
for Piper 10,882.
TEMBLORâ G. S., City. Temblor, fre
quently used in the newspapers printed
in the" English language, is not an En
glish word, which accounts for your in
ability to find it in ancient or modern dic
tionaries. It is Spanish and is used in
the sense that trembling is. ' Temblor
de tierra" is the Spanish for earthquake.
CANADAâ J. T. L., Oakland, Cal. The
Government of Great Britain does not
receive any revenue from the Dominion of
Canada. The Dominion pays its Governor
General and the salaries of all other of
ficers. It also provides for military and
naval defense. Canada is a colony of
Great Britain the same as Australia.
WHY NOT A LEAP YEARâ E. W. 8.,
Oity. The following explains why the
year 1900 will not be a leap year: If a
year were exactly 365 V* days long there
would be a leap year every four years,
but as there is an excess of 11 minutes
10 3 seconds each year this excess is com
pensated for by dropping the leap year at
the beginning of three out of four centu
ries thus equalizing the time gained
through the century. The length of time
thus established makes an error of only
one day in 3325 years. Of the years con
cluding the centuries, and known as the
hundredth year, such as 1800, 1900, on.y
every fourth year is^.a leap year, com
mencing with 20<jO, or such as are devis
able d/ 400-that is to say. 2000, 2400, 2SOO
and so on.
THE PONY EXPRESSâ Subscriber,

mail line between San Francisco and
New York, by way of Sacramento, Cal.,

pli s the distance was traveled by fleet
horsemen, each of whom rode sixty miles.
The weight carried was not to exceed
ten pounds, end the charge was $<"> gold

an ounce in weight The time between
San Francisco and New York waa four
teen days. The express was in operation
about two years, going cut of existence
when the overland telegraph was com
pleted.
PATENT LEATHERâ Subscriber. City.
There is nothing that will prevent patent
leather shoes from cracking, but by care
exercised with the shoes the cracking may
be reduced to a minimum. That is when
the shoes are removed at night they are
warm and the leather is soft. During the
nijrht the warmth is dispelled and the
leather becomes stiffer than it was the
night before. If the wearer will place the
shoes where they can become warmed
before putting them on the chances of
cracking will not be so great. The follow
ing is given as a polish for patent leather:
Take one-quarter of a pound of molasses
or sugar, half an ounce of gum arable
and <>ne pound of ivory black, which boil
well together. Then let the vessel stand
until the contents are cooled and settled,
after which bottle off. This is an excel
lent reviver and may be used as a black
ing in the ordinary way, no brushes for
polishing being required.

The -whole effort of the insurgents for
three months was to hold off the Ameri
cans until their ally, the rains, arrived.
In this they have been as successful as
they could have hoped. Unless affairs
tike some unforeseen turn the Filipinos
will resume the war this fall with fresh
spirit and a replenished stock of arms
and ammunition. One shipload of arms,
it is learned on good authority, has
reached them within the past week. Of
money the leaders of the insurrection
have no lack. They control the resources
cf a large and exceedingly rich country,
and even though no crops were harvested â 
for several years they could still obtain
enough cash and supplies by impressing
to their use the treasures of the church,
the storehouses of farmers and manufao- i
Ordered to the Front*
Â» turers and the funds of private individ- I
, uals. a system of levy which they have
! long enforced with considerable success,
i All the ships coming .tnd going in the
ports recently opened to trade pay heavy
tribute to the insurrection. Much of the
profits of this informal sort of govern
ment are supp'->3^d to go into the pockets
of the leaders excepting Agruinaldo, who
is generally acquitted of enriching himself
by the present war: but wh^n tne public
treasury becomes empty the pollt
who are exploiting Aguinaldo may. if they
see a possibility of success, consider the
war a good privp.te investment.
Reports brought through the lines to
trds and Filipinos in this cfty are
that the spirits of the Insurrectionists are
improving. Americans. lik*- the Span
iards, must defer to nature and rest on
their arms most of the time while the
: country is a mud wallow. The generals
are telling their followers that American
Inaction during the past month is due
to discouragement and demoralization. .

Through the American secret service
' come different storiesâ that the Filipino
' army is -becoming decimated by daily de
ns to the unmbi'r of twenty or thir
ty and is fast losing heart and on the
; verge of disruption. Past experience
â  with the secret service justifies a suspi
cion that many of ;;^ employes, most of
whom ar* natives or Spaniards, are de*-p

seaming to earn their pay, while the ref
ugees who come through the lin>-s have
been disposed to give reports which they
think will please the authorities.
Almost since the beginning of the war
they have pictured the Filipino army as on
its last legs, and Its collapse but a ouÂ»-s-

Otis caused the country to be placarded
with an offer of $30 for each insurgent

some r<-aaon The newspaper correspond

There was a time- when Apriinaldo's ,

: itÂ« destruction appeared inevitable. That :
was when Mac Arthur had captured San j

thought himself able to take Tarlac from
the rear, and asked to be allowed to do
It with the men and rations he had. But
orders came to withdraw his troops from
San Isidro and return to Malolos, leaving
small garrisons at some of the towns he

TO BLOCKADE
ALL PORTS IN
PHILIPPINES
Plan Likely to Be Adopted
by Secretary Root the
Coming Autumn.
DEEMED AJECESSITC
Would Prevent the Landing of Ex
peditions With Supplies for
the Insurgents.
Boeclal Di.^atch to Th<Â» Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.â The estab
lishment of a blockade of the ports of
the Philippine Is!a r ally those
of Luzon, is a subject which is receiv
ing attention at the War Department,
although Secretary Root says he has
as yet not sufficient information to
warrant leflnite action in the matter.
Th- Secretary t-ays that he believes
in taking advantage of everything nec
essary to make a campaign successful.
and that war cannot be made without
causing distress. At the same time he
thinks an absolute blockade may do
more injury just now than good. He
considers that it would be a serious
hardship upon a peaceful community
to ?hut them off from means of sub
nce because â  port that supplies
them is> in the hands of marauders. An
matter that baa to be considered
is the fact that the m-rchar.ts and busi
ness m<=n in Manila would be seriously
crippled, and It might cause a great
deal of dissatisfaction should a rigid
blockade be maintained at the present
time. The possibilities are. however,
that when the fall campaign begins
there will be an effective blockade
maintained and that commerce between
the town? within the American lines
and the country in the control of the
insurgents will be stopped. Meanwhile
all possible precaution will be taken to
prevent arms and ammunition from be
ing supplied to the insurgents.
MILES' WARM WORDS
FOR SECRETARY ROOT
Says He Is a Man of Business and |
Conditions Are Already
Improving.
NEW YORK. Aug. General Nelson
A. Miles said to the Philadelphia corre
spondent of the Tribune: "The new Sec
retary of War is a man of business. As
a result different conditions already exist.
The interests of the country have de- I
manded a vigorous prosecution-of the war j
In the Philippines. Now they will have It.
"I know nothing about a change of com- i
manders on the island. My command of â 
the army has nothing to do with the ad- '
ministration. As major general command- |
ing I am responsible for the health and
discipline of the army. Both are in ex
cellent condition.
"General Otis is a fine officer. That has
been demonstrated by the splendid morale
of the army, its health and Its efficiency |
in the Reid "in the Philippines.
"The inadequate force to meet the re- i
quirements has been the cause of some
what abating the results which have been
achieved. Our army, notwithstanding the ;
superiority of the enemy in numbers, has
been victorious in every engagement. The
army may be large and valiant enough to j
defeat an army quadruple its size, but it !
takes additional force to hold the towns
In an enemy's country and to cover lines j
of communication.
"About 20 per cent of our army under ;
any conditions Is practically inactive ow- i
ing to various duties about the camp and ;
In hospitals, transportation, sickness and
various other causes. In the Civil War i
only a portion of the army operated on j
the fighting line. A great bulk of the
troops were engaged in various duties in ,
the rear. Much embarrassment has been
occasioned by the supplying of the enemy
with food and munitions of war by their
friends in Manila and Hongkong, not to
speak of encouragement from their friends
In - the States.' It is difficult to discrimin- i
ate in the enemy's country between non- 1
combatants and foes."

Brumby and the Vice Consul here, this

day by M. Gran, president of the Alpes-

through the rooms of the prefecture, the
former palace of the King of Piedmont.
The arty then called on General O'Far
rell, the acting military governor, whom
Admiral Dewey thanked for the permis
sion he had received to land and drill bis
men at Villefranche during the remainder
of the cruiser Olympia's stay at that
place. The Americans also called on
Naval Commander Duval, whom Admiral
Dewey thanked for the port facilities
which had been granted to his vessel. The
\dmiral asked M. Duval to transmit his
thanks to the Maritime Prefect at Tou
lon for sending cruisers to salute the
Olympia on her arrival.
The it habitants of Nice gave Admiral
Dewey an ovation as he passed through
the streets. He returned to Villefranche
at noon
Admiral Dewey expresses regret In re
gard to the incorrect reports concerning
his reception at Trieste. He says It was

In the Golf Contest, Which Is Still

Special Dlf^atcli to The Call.
DEL MONTE, Aug. 24.â For the second
time during the series of sports at this
place Northern California has come off
victorious, and in both cases it Is to Bur
lingamo that the laurels go. Miss Mary
Fcott of Burlingame captured the prize In
the ladies' golf tournament, and now the
Burlingame polo team has defeated the
Southern California team, with a score
that came very near having a goose egg
to the south'a credit.
The match began at 3:30 p. m., with R.
M and Jo Tobin, Charlie Baldwin and C
M. Dunphy In the held for Burlingame.
and C. B. Maud and R. L. Bettner of
Riverside and W. Stillwell and C. Ealand
of Santa Barbara representing the Bouih.
Burlingame Ht-ored the rst goaL Bald
win and I'unphy played exceptionally
well.
Burlingan scored eight goals before the
Bouth made itself felt to any great extent,
but then the southern men rallied and
made several splendid plays, scoring a
goal. The last two points were hotly con
tested and the game, that at first had
been rather slow, eloped much excite
ment unions, the crowd of spectators. 1 he
t-core was it Co 1 in Burlingame's favor.
The men's golf contest for the Del Monte
cup that ... d yesterday, is still uniin-
Ished; but the odds are two to one in favor
r>f victory going to the southern players.
The second round in the final competition
resulted in throwing out all but three
southern men, Tufts. Cosby and Maud,
und one northern man, Fitzgerald. Tufts
uvA Cosby played off this i noon, Tufts
winning in good style. To-morrow morn

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 24.â The Pacific
Coast Association of Amateur Oarsmen
was organized at regatta headquarters
last night. The following gentlemen were
present:
W. G. Frye of the University of Cali
fornia, 11. A. Witkopf of the Ariel Rowing
Club. S. J. Pembroke of Alameda Rowing
Club, Dr. C. C Dennis and J. Foley of
South End Boat Club, G. C. .Fulton of
Astoria Rowing Club. George Jam) of
Olympic Boat Club was represented by
Mr Pembroke. Mr. Fulton was chosen
temporary chairman and Harrison Allen
temporary secretary. The constitution
and by-laws which had been prepared
were then taken up. Each section was
carefully gone over and discussed at
length. The by-laws place oarsmen In
two classes, junior and senior, the inter
mediate class being struck out. A junior
oarsmen is one who has never won a
junior race, while a senior is one who (
has won a junior or senior race. It is j
specified that medals shall not exceed ;
$'<& in value, chough donation cups may be
worth any amount. hen the value of
a first prize for any event shall be less
than $35 there shall be no second prize.
The Idea of this rule is to prevent the
cheapening of medals.
There was much discussion as to defini
tion of boats which shall be used. Some
of the delegates were In favor of adopt
ing the Improved boats, which are of
greater speed, but as I here is only one of
these boats on San Francisco Bay it wu.s
decided to let the matter rest for another
year. It Is expected a majority of clubs
will buy fast boats a year hence, If so
this rule may be changed. The definition i
of barges and skiffs follows:
A barge shall be a clinker-built boat
rowing on the gunwale, meaning that the'
rowlocks shall not be outrigged, and a
skiff shall be a clinker-built boat, not ex
ceeding 21 feet 6 inches in length and 22
inches in width.
The constitution was adopted, and copies
will be sent to all Pacific Coast clubs.
The election of ofttcers resulted as fol
lows:
President G. C. Fulton of Astoria; vice ;
president, S. J. Pembroke of San Fran- :
Cisco; secretary, Harrison Allen of As

DE HAVEN DECIDES
THAT NORTH ERRED
SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED MER
CHANT OTA TO LAUD.
But the Secretary of the Treasury
Alone Has the Right to Review
the Action of the Immigra
tion Commissioner.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday rendered his opinion in the
matter of the habeas corpus petition of
S. Ota, a Japanese merchant of this city,
who was prevented from landing at this
port by 11. H. North. United States Immi
gration Commissioner. General W. 11. L..
Barnes, representing the petitioner, was
present in court. The following Is the full
text of the decision:
This is a proceeding arising upon a writ of
habeas corpus Issued en behalf of one H. Ota,
and the ease was submitted to the court for its
decision upon the petition for the -vr;t. the re
turn thereto and certain admissions made by
counsel during the argument, from which 1
tin. i the following farts: - Â_Â«_.
That the said b. Ota Is a native and subject
of the empire of Japan, and for more than
eight years has been a resident of the State of
California and is now a merchant and a mem
ber of the firm of Ota *â¢ Sanuda, San Fran
cisco; that said firm deals in Japanese fancy
goods teas and coffee, and Imports, manufac
tures'and sells all kinds of bamboo furniture;
that In March of the present year the said 8.
Ola went to Japan for the purpose of buying
goods for his firm, and after having made pur
chases to the amount in value of more than
five thousand dollars he returned to Ban Fran
cisco on the steamship Hongkong Maru, arriv
ing at that port on or about August 5, 1899, and
thereafter on the 10th day of August, 1899, after
a. special inquiry by the Immigration officials
at the port of San Francisco he was found to
be Buffering from a loathsome and contagious
disease and was ordered by 11. H. North, the
Commissioner of Immigration at that port, to
be returned to Japan, and is now in the cus
tody of the steamship company operating the
Hongkong Maru for the purpose of being so
returned to Japan. .â .,"â¢â  , ... Â»
Upon these facts I think it v<>ry clear that
the petitioner is not an alien Immigrant, and
that the Commissioner of Immigration erred in
ordering him to be returned to Japan (in re
Panzara. 51 Fed. 175); but under the act of
August 1. 1894, 28 Stats. 390, the only mode of
correcting this error Is by an appeal to the Sec
retary of the Treasury. That act provides :
In every case where an alien Is excluded from
admission Into the United States under any law
or treaty now existing or hereafter made, the
decision 'of the appropriate immigration or cus
toms officer if adverse to the admission of such
alien shall' be final unless reversed on appeal
to the Secretary of the Treasury.
This statute was before the Supreme Court
in the case of J>m Moon Sing vs. United
States ir,B U. S. 638. and was there construed
as taking away from the courts the authority
to review or set aside the decision of the execu
tive officers named, when such decision is ad
verse to an alien claiming. the right to enter
r.r re-enter the United States. See also In re
Mopes, S3 Fed. MS. â ::â¢': : :
The writ will be discharged.
The case has been appealed to the Sec
retary of the Treasury and will be de
cided in a few days. There is no doubt
that Ota will be allowed to land.

MRS. SUCHINSKI'S DEMAND.
Insane Woman Asks That She Be
Sworn on a Brass Crucifix.
The release of Frances Suchinski from j
the I'kiah Asylum for the Insane on the
ground that she had recovered her mental
balance was a little premature. Up to a I
few months ago the unfortunate woman
lived at 4213 Eighteenth street. She sold j
the property and Leon Czarnecki went to
live In the house, Mrs. Suchinski began [
to annoy the people living in her old home j
and finally she was arrested and sent to â¢
the asylum mentioned, as she was clearly
insane. A few weeks ago some friends
of the unfortunate woman secured a writ !
of habeas corpus for her release, and on i
the showing made by them the court â 
granted the writ Last Friday, however,
the insane woman invaded her old home ;
and, armed with a saw, made a vicious
attack on Mrs. I^-onore Czarnecki. A
policeman was summoned and the scream-
Ing woman was taken to prison. Yester
day morning her case again came up be
fore Judge Cook. When she was brought
Into court she loudly demanded that she
be sworn on a brass crucifix she carried j
and followed her demand with an inco
herent babble, It was readily seen that
she was not quite right mentally and
Judge Cook again admitted her to the
asylum.

MORE REGIMENTS
TO BE ORGANIZED
At Least One Will Be Composed of
Negro Soldiers Commanded by
Regular Army Officers.
NEW YORK, Aug. 24.â A Sun special
from Washington says: Orders for the
enlistment of more volunteer regiments
will be issued soon by the War Depart
ment. The quota of 35.000 enlisted men
for the volunteer army authorized by Con
gress has been nearly exhausted, and only
four regiments can be obtained from the
remainder, nearly f.OOO men. At least one
of the new volunteer regiments will be
composed of negroes. Black soldiers have
given such good service that there is now
! no fear that they will prove unsatisfac-
I tory if placed under officers of the regular
Whether the military authorities will
1 organize more than two new regiments
of volunteers cannot bo ascertained, but
it was said at the department to-day that
the Question of whether it is advisable
to enlist more than one negro regiment
was under consideration.
Two battalions each of the Twrnty
fouith and Twenty-fifth Infantry Regi
ments, both composed of negroes, are
now In the Philippines, and during, their
short service have done excellent work.
Tin- ability of the negro to withstand the
hurd.ships in a tropical climate is one of
the principal reasons why the department
has determined to organize at least one
regiment composed of men of that race.
The colonel and other field officers or
this regiment will be taken from the reg
ular army, but no information Is obtain
able as to whether any of the other offi
cers will be i.egroes. Twenty-threu regi
ments of volunteers have been organized
or are now in progress of organization.
Three of these, including one regime.nt of
: cavalry, are being tormed in the Philip
pines from discharged men of the regular
and volunteer services.
The army reorganization which pro
' vided for the enlistment of tk.,000 regulars
! and 35,000 volunteers, apparently pre
i scribes that three of the volunteer regi
ments shall be composed of expert marks
'â â  mon and horsemen, and shall be orga
' nlzed as cavalry, either mounted or dis
i mounted. This provision was inserted on
account of the excellent service rendered
by Roosevelt's Rough Riders, a regiment
j composed of men familiar with the horse
I and the rifle. Should it be decided to en
list the full volunteer strength authorized
1 some of the new regiments will probably
j be organized as cavalry.

WHERE AND HOW
Wall Paper Was First Manufactured
and Used.
While various kinds of printed
| fabrics were known to the people of
I most remote antiquity, it was not until
] the eighteenth century that wall paper
' in anything like its present form came
! into common use in Europe, though it
appears to have been used much earlier
in China. A few rare examples which
may be as early as the sixteenth cen
! tury exist in England, but these are
I imitations, generally in "flock," of the
I old Florentine and Genoese cut velvets,
! and hence the style of the design in no
way shows the date of the wall paper,
the same traditional patterns being re
produced with little or no change for
many years. It was not till the end of
the last century that the machinery to
make paper in long strips was invent
ed. Up to that time wall papers were
printed on small square pieces of hand
made paper and were very expensive.
On this account wall paper was slow
in superseding the older mural decora
tions, such as tapestry, stamped leather
and pi.p er cloth.
A work printed in London in 1744
throws some light on the use of wall
papers at that time:
"The method of printing wall papers
of the better sort is probably the same
now that it has ever been. Wooden
blocks with the design rut in relief, one
for each color, are applied by hand,
after being dipped in an elastic cloth
sieve charged with wet tempera pig
ment great care being taken to lay
each block exactly on the right place,
so that the various colors may 'register'
lor fit together. In order to suit the
! productions of the paper mills these
! blocks are made in England 21 inches
wide and in France IS inches wide.
The length of the block is limited to
what the workman can easily lift with
one handâ two feet being about the
limit, as the blocks are necessarily
thick, and in many cases made heavier
by being inlaid with copper, especially
the thin outlines, which, if made of
wood, would not stand the wear and
tear of printing.
"In 'flock' and gold and silver print
! ing the design is first printed in strong
! size, the flock (finely cut wool of the re
'â  quired color), or metallic powder, is
then sprinkled by hand all over the
paper; it adheres only to the wet size,
and is easily shaken off the ground or
unsized part. If the pattern is required
j to stand out in some relief the process
' is repeated several times and the whole
i paper then rolled to compress the flock.
! Cheaper sorts of paper are printed by
machinery, the design being cut on the
i surface of wooden rollers under which
] the paper passes. The chief drawback
to this process is that all the colors are j
applied rapidly one after the other j
without allowing each to dry separately |
as is done in hand painting. A some- |
what blurred appearance is usually the
result." â Paper Trade.

MULTIPLICITY
Of Duties That People Crowd Upon
the Policeman.
The big policeman at the foot of the
stairway leading frc.-m the street to the
Reading Kailroad's Spring Garden
street station had just finished telling
that a guardian of the peace had more j
things to attend to in the line of his
official duties than appeared on the sur
face, when a good-looking young
woman, pushing a baby carriage, in
which was seated an infant of perhaps |
eight or ten months, approached him.
"Would you mind seeing that no one J
bothers the baby while I run up to the |
station?" she asked.
The officer's face took on a stern ex
pression.
"What do you want to go up to the
station for?" he questioned severely.
"To see the trains go by?"
"Oh, no," was the reply, "I just want
a time table."
"Humph," responded the bluecoat,
"I'll go up and get the time table for
you. Just wait and see that no one
bothers the baby yourself."
But the young woman was halfway
up the ste"ps by this time and there
was no-thing for the policeman to do
but stand by the baby carriage until
she returned. She was gone a little
longer, apparently, than she should
have been just to obtain a time table,
and the officer's evident anxiety in
creased Avith each passing moment.
Finally, however, she came tripping
down the steps.
"Thank you, very much," she exÂ»
claimed sweetly to the policeman, pre
paring to push the baby carriage up
the street. "I suppose you were afraid
that I was going to get aboard a train
and leave the baby on your hands,
weren't you?"-
The bluecoat muttered something to
the effect that he never had any such
thought, and the young woman de
parted.
"She was right, though, in thinking
that you were afraid she was going to
desert the infant," I said. "Come, now,
cnvn up. Wasn't sHe?"
The policeman grinned an expansive
grin.
"Well," he finally answered, "there is
a good deal of that sort of thing going
on, you know, and we can't be too care
ful. Remember what I was tilling you
about the multiplicity of a policeman's
duties, don't you?"
With which query he strolled on down
the street, swinging his club and softly
whistling a bar of "Pack Your Trunk
and Go." â Philadelphia Inquirer.
NEW AMUSEMENT
Discovered by a Man With a Jag, at
a Cost of $4 35.
"I gmess the most profitable trip this
car ever made for the company was one
it made a few nights ago."
The speaker was the conductor on an
Eleventh street trolley car.
"The Incident happened along about 1
a. m., just as I was making my last run.
There were but two or three passengers
on the car, when a well-dressed young
fellow, who looked as If he had money
to burn and with a 'jag' that must have
cost him considerable to purchase,
climbed aboard. He took a seat back in
the coiner and rode along without saying
anything for a while. Finally, after I
had rung up the fares of a couple more
persons who got on the car, he beckoned

TRAVEL MANY MILES AN HOUR.
Have you ever thought of the distance
you travel while you are out for an hour's
stroll?
Possibly you walk three miles in an
hour, but that does not represent the dis
tance you travel. The earth turns on its
axis every twenty-four hours. In round
figures call the ' earth's circumference
"4 i mX) miles, and you must have traveled
during your hour's stroll a thousand miles
in the axial turn of the earth.
But this is not all. The earth makes a
journey around the sun every year. Put
the distance of our planet from the sun
at P2 OQO .OOO- miles, and the circumference
described by the earth 575.000.000 miles.
In other words, the earth travels around
the sun each day 1,584.000 miles, and every
hourâ for instance, the hour during *vhieh
you took your walkâ the earth moved
through 66,000 miles.
So. adding your three miles of leg travel
to the hour's "axial movement of the earth,
this to the earth's orbital journey, anrl
that again to the earth's excursion with
the sun and you will find you have trav
eled within the hour 86.930 miles.-New

RESCUE OF IE
GOLD HUNTERS
Lieutenant Jarvis Files
His Report.
COMMANDED CUTTER BEAR
FORTY-EIGHT PEOPLE KNOWN
TO HAVE DIED.
Two Hundred and Fifty Survivors
Taken Out From Kotzebue
and Provided With Neces
sary Food.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24.â Captain Shoe
maker of the revenue cutter service to
day received a report from Lieutenant D.
H. Jarvis, the commander of the revenue
cutter Bear, containing an account of thÂ«
rescue of the gold-seekers who rushed
into the Kotzebue gold country, Alaska,
in thÂ«; summer of 1898. Lieutenant Jarvis
was taking the Bear north to Cape Bar
row on her regular trip. At Cape Prince
of Wales he learned of the awful destitu
tion which had overtaken the go]d-seeker3
at Kotzebue Sound. On arrival there ha
found a terrible condition 01 affairs. Men
had died of starvation, scurvy and by
drowning, and he obtained a list of forty
eight deaths. But the list is by no means
complete. This list has been published in
the Associated Press dispatches. Over
10W of the gold-seekers had wintered
there. The Bear, alter relieving as much
of the distress as possible and leaving
stores, lime juice, etc.. for the survivors,
took eighty-two of the survivors to St.
Michael, where they were turned over 10
the military authorities. Lieutenant Jarvis'
report is dated July 30 at St. Michael. He
reported, that he left between 225 and 2io
survivors at Kotzebue Sound. He in
formed the department that lie would pro
ceed to Cape Barrow and upon his return
would touch at Kotzebue Sound and pick
up any who desired to return with him.
Lieutenant Jarvis says: "First Lieuten
ant Bcrtholf and Surgeon Hawley were
sent to the camp at liotham inlet. They
returned with thirty-two sick and conva
lescent, all affected with scurvy. Some of
these were in very low condition, and the
chances are that some of them would not
have survived many days without rnrdi
cine. From 225 to 250 people are still in
the camp. Some had plenty of food and
means of paying their way out.
â¢â¢Returning to the camp Lieutenant
Bertholf and the surgeon brought off all
those In a destitute condition or without
meansâ forty-eight men, two women and
an infant, making eighty-three persona
in all taken from the camp. It was not
possible to take any more at that time,
but assurance was given the people ashore
that if they did not succeed in getting
away before the vessel's return they
would be taken out by the Bear. There
were plenty of provisions for the use of
those remaining, many of them having a
year's outfit, and the only sick person
remaining was a Mrs. Smith, whose casÂ«
was so serious that she could not be
moved. _
"The rush of people to Kotzebue Sound
â was a sad. deplorable affair. Misled by
false information and advertisements,
1200 people, many totally unfitted to stand
hard conditions and climate, rushed to
the country during the open season of 189*.
During the winter no gold whatever was
found, and in the spring they sought every
means of escaping from the region, and
in so doing: many lost their lives."
"1 apprehend also that many of those
who started coasting along the shore for
Cape Nome may have lost their lives in
the Ice and bad weather."
Lieutenant Jarvis. who accomplished tho
rescue of the sold seekers at Kotzebua
Sound, is the revenue marine officer who
in the -winter of ISH7-9S led a relief expedi
tion from Tur.miak, 200 miles below St.
Michael, to Point Barrow. Over 1500 miles
of snow and ice in the dead of winter hÂ«
pushed an expedition for the relief of th<Â»
ice-imprisoned whalers at Point Barrow.
He arrived there with nearly 500 reindeer
after four months of almost indescribable
hardships. It was the only Arctic relief
expedition ever attempted in midwinter.
For his heroism nn that occasion the Pres
ident recommended that Congress givo
him a vote of thanks stnd award him a
gold medai.
Blood Thicker Th*n Water.
That it exists there ran be no doubt.
Even to people on this side of the Atlan
tic it is apparent: and those who, like my
self, have lately passed through thÂ«
United States can testify as to its inten
sity and spontaneity. The cause which
has produced it is not far to seek. A
greater sympathy and friendship has been
apparent* for two or three years. Even,
the excitement about the Venezuelan dis
pute failed to disturb it: and when it
looked as if Continental Europe was dis
posed to enter the contest between the
United States and Spain, not so much in
defense of Spanish interests as with a
view of humiliating: the United States,
there appeared a genuine sympathetic
interest which extended from the man in,
the street to the Cabinet Minister at
Whitehall. We pitied the fall of Spain,
bur Â«ye could not help feeling that our
kinsmen were taking up the cause for
which this country in the past has spent
so much and made such gigantic sacri
fices. As became a neutral, we were un
moved spectators of events, until that
whisper arose which stirred us all to our
depthfl.
When it became evident that an in
trigues was on foot to thi-uw a Latin alli
ance into arms against the United States
the voice of Grent Britain was unmis
takably heard and we showed plainly that
in such an event Great Britain must ba
reckoned with, any attempt to wrest from
our kinsmen the gains won by her sons
ashore :md afloat by a combination or
Continental Europe would have to mccl
the whole Anglo-Saxon race in armed
alliance. The storm passed, but that little
proof of our sincerity did more than a
torrent of words to establish cordial rela
tions between th" United States and Great
Britain. Our kinsmen realized for the first
tima what we have never doubted over
here. that, differ as we may between our
selves, neither of us would ever see ths
flag of Anglo-Saxon freedom dipped on
either side of the Atlantic to an over
whelming combination of Continental Eu

TWENTY BANDIT
SUSPECTS SLAIN
Alleged Act of Cavalry
in Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 24.â Passengers
on the steamer Olivette arriving to
night from Havana report the particu
lars of an affair occurring at Gibara,
news of which, it is alleged, was cen
sored by the Government authorities.
Juan A. Calderon, formerly Judge at
Gibara but recently removed by the
military authorities, brought to Ha
vana the report of the killing, by the
Tenth Cavalry, of twenty men suspect
ed of being bandits. Calderon states
he was removed from his post because
he attempted an investigation of this
wholesale killing. He says for some
time Ernest Russell, captain in the
Rural Guards, and Lieutenant Venegas.
at the head of the detachment of the
Tenth Cavalry, have been unlawfully
arresting many persons well known in
Gibara to be of good character on
charges of a flimsy nature.
A few days ago sp-ldiers, according to
Caideron's story', shot twenty of these
suspects in cold blood, giving as the
only reason they were afraid the pris
oners per contemplating an attempt to
escape. Calderon gives the list of men
thus killed, who were all reputable citi
zens, he says, of that section. Calderon
also says that because they attempted
to investigate the crimes Judges of
Holguin. Gibara, Mayari and Puerto
Farde have been suspended by the
American authorities and that on the
matter being carried to General Wood
he sustained the actions of the au
thorities in suspending the Judge?.
The story told by Calderon has caused
much comment in Havana and an in
vestigation will be made at once. Pas
sengers on the Olivetti state that press
dispatches relating to the matter were
stopped by the authorities and the gen
eral impression is that the killing did
occur as told. Another report which
reached Havana from the scene was to
the effect that twenty suspects were
lined up and shot by thÂ« detnchment of
cavalry without trial. The victims, ac
cording to this later story, were ar
rested on suspicion of belonging to a
gang of bandits which has been com
mitting depredations about Gibara.

ENGLISHMEN VISIT
CHINESE THIBET
Obtain Much Valuable
Information.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Wash., Aug. 24.â The
steamship Kinshui Maru brings news
that two Englishmen, E. Amendesen
and J. Bonin, have just traversed Chi
nese Thibet, situated in Szechuan prov
ince. This country has heretofore been
closely guarded, no Europeans having
previously penetrated it.
Amendesen and his companion
brought much interesting information.
Everything in this part of Thibet bears
the stamp of poverty. The moral status
of the people is much above that of
their wealthier neighbors of the adjoin
ing provinces. Robbers are unknown,
and travel is safe. The roads are
mountainous and baggage animals are
scarce. This Thibetan district is di
vided into two kingdoms â Mill and
Chalag. Supreme authority in each
kingdom is vested in a priest king. The
King of Mili spends his time between
thre>i different Lamaseries, the princi
pal one b^ing Mill Genchen, where 300
lamas live. Three days before reach
ing this place Amendesen met the King
at his Wajin Lamasery and was court
eously received. The King stated that
his people were poor but honest. He
rules them with an iron hand, severely
punishing all wrongdoing. The king
dom of Chalag is more populous and
wealthy. Gold is known to exist in pay
ing quantities. The Chinese attempted
to work it, but the Thibetans rose
against them, driving them out with
loss.
In Chalag Amendesen passed a large
cave which the natives claimed was five
days' journey in extent. People are pro
hibited from entering it because many
who formerly ventured in never re
turned to report their adventures.
Crossing into Yunnan, Amendesen
found the people there to be a mixture
of Chinese and Thibetan, called Moso
by the Chinese. In religion and cus
toms they are Thibetans. The name
of this district is Jang.
From thence he went to the district
of Yunglin a plain full of scattered vil
lages with the usual monastery, where
the King lives. In this instance the
King is not a Lama. The left bank
of the Yangtse Kiang River is reached
a day and a half from this place.
Amendesen's notes will entirely change
the geography of that hitherto un
known region. His remarkable journey
was made with only a Chinese boy and
a Thibetan helper for companions.

TRIES TO TAKE
HIS WIFE'S LIFE
San Luis Obispo Man's
Brutal Deed.
THE KNIFE BLADE BREAKS
THIS PROBABLY PREVENTS A I
MURDER.
Couple Had Been Quarreling for
Some Time and the Woman Had
Left Her Husband for
Safety.
Special Disratch to The Call.
SAX LUIS OBISPO, Aug. 24.â San Luis
Obispo came close to recording a murder
last night, and it is purely by a fortunate
accident that Mrs. Guadalupe Cordova is
now alive. About 8:15 last evening Mrs.
Cordova was stabbed by her husband
with a small butcher-knife and frightfully
cut about the shoulders and arms. There j
has been trouble in the Cordova family for
several days. Tuesday Guadalupe Cor
dova, or "Lupe," as he was familiarly
known, had some words with his wife and
threatened to kill her. The outcome of it
was that she left their home and went to
the Tweed residence, next door.
Mrs. Cordova feared that her husband
would carry out his threats and kill her. j
and had him arrested on a charge of j
threats against life. Guadalupe was re
leased on Donds. '- _^ â â - â¢â¢â - â 'â 'â 
He had left his coat at the Tweed
home, and last night knocked at the door
and in response to Mrs. Tweed question
as to what he wanted replied that he de
sired to come in and get his coat. He en
tered and called for his wife, who was in I
bed in an adjoining room. Mrs. Cordova
refused to come out of the room, where
upon Guadalupe dragged her out, drew
from his pocket a small butcher knife
with a blade about five inches in length
and began to stab his wife with it.
His intention evidently was to stab her
over the heart, but as she had her back to
him and was in a corner of the room he !
was unable to strike her on that part of
the body, but stabbed her about the shoul
ders and arms. All that saved Mrs. Cor
dova's life was the breaking of the knife- i
blade. In striking the right shoulder
blade about three inches of the blade of i
the knife was broken off and dropped to
the floor. After the blade was broken
Cordova made several more slashes at his
wife, one of which was on the left side of
the neck. Had the knife-blade not been
broken at that time the jugular vein
would have been severed and death would
have resulted almost instantly. . It is j
thought that the injured woman will re
cover.
Cordova was captured at an early hour \
this morning by Officer Munoz. He had ,

BIG GUNS TESTED
BY ARMY OFFICERS
Captain Clark of the Ordnance De
partment Examining Fortifica
tions Along the Coast.
ASTOr.IA, Or., Aug. 24.â Three of the |
ten-inch disappearing guns mounted at !
Fort Stevens were tested to-day. The
test was made under the supervision of
Captain Clark of the Ordnance Depart- j
ment, who is visiting- the Pacific Coast !
on a special detail for technical exam- '
ination and official report as to the i
completeness and efficiency of all the j
new batteries located along the coast.
Everything connected with the mech- j
anism and ammunition for the guns j
was carefully scrutinized and measured j
before the firing took place.
Captain Clark expressed the highest j
satisfaction with the guns. The day j
was perfect and the test was success
ful in -every respect. The projectile
used was a solid conical shot weighing i
nearly 600 pounds. Two of the guns j
were fired at a range of five and a half ]
miles over the open water. At the
point of impact with the ocean a col
umn of water spouted into the air sev- !
eral hundred feet. Commander Pat
terson aimed the guns and controlled !
the firing squad. The last shot fired I
was aimed at a fixed target, which was
the extreme detached end of some old
piling over the jetty. The range finder
showed the point to be something over ;
three and a half miles from the gun.
When the smoke cleared away it was
found that the bunch of piles had been
fairly struck, one of them being broken j
and carried away.
OWNER OF BLUE JAY
LEFT IN THE LURCH
Miner Employed by Him "Works a j
Few Days and Suddenly
Disappears.
REDDING, Aug. 24.â Jack Graves,
now sole owner of the Blue Jay mine, |
that famous pocket ylelder of Coffee j
Creek, is laying awake nights trying to j
figure out if he. has been robbed. The
yield of the Blue Jay once caused the
largest mining rush that has ever been
experienced in Northern California. Of
late the property has lain idle, appa
rently having ceased yielding. Jack
Graves became sole owner.
He recently decided to drive a tun
nel thirty feet in length to tap the ledge
at a low point. He engaged a big, j
husky young miner, name unknown, to ,
drive the drift. He provided him with
tools and a month's provisions. The
man was working alone three miles |
from the nearest habitation. Jack
Graves decided to visit the property
Thursday. The miner could not be j
found. The energetic fellow had drift
ed for six feet and panned every pound i
of the dirt. He then took some of the \
provisions and made his departure, j
whither no one knows.
It is the uncertainty of the results
of the stranger's panning that is driv- '
ing Jack Graves gray-headed. Did he !
strike a $40,000 pocket, such as the mine
Once before yielded? It is possible.
Time alone will tell.

MUMMIES OF AN ANCIENT
RACE FOUND IN A CAVERN
Discovery J^ade by a Scientist During a
SearcK for Indian Relics in Western
Ganada.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. Harlan H. Smith, who represents the Na- Â©
tional Museum of New York, has bean on the coast for three months looking- O
up ancient remains and endeavoring to make collections of Indian relics. *o
He arrived here this afternoon from the Harrison Lake; district, where he Â«
made the strangest find of allâ well preserved mummy,' which he says may q
be over a thousand years old. 2*
Two days ago he found the remains of what was without 0
doubt a dead Indian chieftain, and to-day he sent the body forward to New Â«
York. He was examining some kitchen middens, when he came across a 8
stone bearing a hieroglyphic inscription, and It did not take him long to ascer-
tain that this was the door of a hermetically sealed cave. The cave had been gj
cut out of a strong calcium chloride rock. The body was preserved in just the q
same manner as an Egyptian mummy. Mr. Smith said that to an expert the gj>
marks of peculiarity in preparation were always noticeable. <5
"Decomposition takes place under the skin," said Mr. Smith, "and the jo
cuticle remains hard and will stay that way for ages. A slight lifting of the 8
woven wrappers caused the emanation of the penetrating smell that is al- g
ways noticeable when Egyptian wrappings are first removed. The face and tÂ»
hands were practically black and hard and dry. 3
"I do not suppose that it would have stayed in any other formation of 88
rock but the calcium in which I found it. The sarcophagus had evidently *?
been prepared for four persons, but there were no traces of any others, even &
if they had ever been there. I do not think, either, that the remains are X
those of one .of the tribes of Si-washes, the present coast Indians. The body fcÂ»
was that of a tall man with a high forehead, which is just opposite to the In- O
dians around here of the present day. The ornaments and stone implements So
are different from anything I ever saw in connection with the Siwashes." $

A large number of changes in the com
mands of first-rate vessels of the navy i
will occur withing the next two months. |
No word has come from Admiral Samp- j

TROUBLE OVER THE,
SOLDIERS' RAILROAD RATE
S. P. Notifies the Various Lines That
It Can No Longer Abide by
an Agreement.
CHICAGO. Aug. 24.â Passenger officials )
of the Western roads to-day received no- j
tification from the Southern Pacific to
the effect that that line had found it im
possible to carry out the plar for an
equitable distribution of the ea*t-bound
â =oldier traffic from San Francisco. In its
notification the Southern Pacific exploded
a bomb by saying that several of the lines
which had entered into the agreement to
have the business satisfactorily and fairly
distributed were operating with scalpers i
in San Francisco, Omaha and Kansas
City and giving the Philippine campaign- i
ers opportunities to secure rates consid
erably less than those originally agreed
upon 'by all the lines. The agreement now
is regarded as a dead letter, and many
serious complications are expected to arise
as a result of the violation of it.
'The lines drew up a Government-sanc
tioned agreement which fixed a soldier s
rate of $37 50 from the Golden Gate to
Omaha or Kansas City. It was agreed
that the regular rate from the Missouri
River points to this city should be main
tained. Soon after the soldiers began to
return from the Philippines, it is said, the
offending lines began to collaborate with
the brokers in San Francisco and the
Missouri River points. Arrangements
were made whereby the rate from Omaha
was cut fully one-third.

COLONEL BARNETT
FOB TREASURER
Named for State Office
in Pennsylvania.
Snecial Dispatch to The Call.
HARRISBRUG, Aug. 24.â The Republi
can State Convention to-day nominated I
Colonel James Barnett of the Tenth Regi- i
merit for State Treasurer, J. Hay Brown
of Lancaster for Supreme Court Judge and
Josiah R. Adams of Philadelphia for Su
perior Court Judge.
The nomination for Supreme Judge is
equivalent to an election by reason of two
vacancies and no elector being entitled
to vote for more than one person. The
platform indorses the administrations of
President McKinley and Governor Stone,
commends the executive for his appoint
ment of Colonel Quay to the United States
Senate and pledges the party to a reduc
tion in the expenditures of the depart
ments of the State government. It begins
as follows:
We congratulate the people upon the results
of the campaign of 1886, the establishment of a
sound currency, the securing of proper pro
tection to American industry and the election
of that champion of the common people, Wil
liam McKinley. to be President of the United
States. The Republican party has been in con
trol or the national Government for a little
more than two years, and during that time
ever}' promise made by it has been fulfilled.
Business is active and remunerative, labor is
employed at good and increasing wages, capital
has ample field for investment, and- an era of
unexampled prosperity has been inaugurated.
Much of the success of the Republican policy
adopted in 18SS is due to the good judgment,
wise counsel, administrative ability, far-reach
ing diplomacy and broad-minded statesmanship
of our aatriotic President. We firmly support
and fully indorse his administration and place
on record the wish of the Republicans of Penn
sylvania that he be nominated to lead our hosts
to victory In the campaign of IMO, and to this
end we recommend the election of delegates
â who will give his candidacy earnest and vig- !
orous support in the next national convention. j
The platform reaffirms the St. Louis
platform; declares for the maintenance of
the gold standard an* against the free
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1; re
news allegiance to the policy of protection
and indorses the action of Pennsylvania
Congressmen in voting for the Dingley
tariff, and continues:
We congratulate the country on the success
ful termination of the war with Spain and
recognize the wisdom of the policy President
McKinley has inaugurated in the management
of affairs in Cuba and Porto Rico, and prom
ise him our faithful support in the prosecution
of the war in the Philippines, In order that the
supremacy of the . flag planted there by the
valor of our army and navy be maintained.
In additional paragraphs the platform
says:
We have ceased to be content with supplying
products for home consumption alone, we must
keep pace with other nations in seeking new
field." for our commerce, and to this end we
support the policy of industrial, commercial
and national expansion.
We favor for our national defense and the
protection of closer commercial relations be
tween the sections of our vast territory, now
an imperative necessity, the immediate com
mencement and early completion of a great
canal that will give communication between
the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as its pro
tection against foreign control.
We favor the building up of a merchant
marine upon the lines laid out by the bills re
ported favorably to the Senate and House, sec
ond session, Fifty-fifth Congress, so that we
may have a reserve defense in case of war,
and that J200.000.000 of freightage now paid to
foreign ships may remain to the American
ship builder, the American ship owner, the
American seaman and the American mechanic.
CAPITALISTS HAVE ,
BONDED COPPER MINE
Improvements Representing an Out
lay of $1,000,000 Will Be
Made in Shasta.
REDDING, Aug. 24.â The famous
Afterthought group of six copper
claims has just been bonded to John F.
Cowan of Salt Lake for a wealthy com
pany of Salt Lake and Butte (Mont.)
capitalists. The bonding was brought
about by James Sallee, who recently
disposed of the Bully Hill to J. R. de
Lamar and three other mining pro
moters.
It is stated on good authority that
the Afterthought group is already vir
tually sold, though the figure is kept
secret. Mining Experts William Mc-
Dermott and A. J. Schumacker arrived
from Utah a few days ago and on their
recommendation the mine was imme
diately bonded. The Afterthought
group is considered the third richest
copper property in Shasta County. If
the company takes the mine, as they
undoubtedly will, it means that new
smelters and other vast improvements
will be made, representing an outlay of
more than a million dollars.
MOTORMAN ATTACKED
BY AN ANGRY MOB
Had Carelessly Bun Down a Wagon,
Seriously Injuring Its Four
Occupants.
CLEVELAND. Aug. 24.â A big Consol
idated motorman and conductor were
threatened with violence by an angry mob
on Broadway this morning. But for the
timely arrival of the police the motorman
would undoubtedly have been roughly
handled and probably lynched. Cries of
"Lynch him!" Lynch the scab:" were
heard on every side, and the police had
to charge the crowd repeatedly to save
him.
The Broadway car was almost down
town when, running at a rapid rate, it
struck a spring wagon, throwing the four
occupants to the pavement. They were-
John Pofleh, cut severely about"the head
and one ear partially torn off; his wit>
and eight-year-old daughter, both badly
cut about the head and shoulders, and
Joe Krazinstine, a neighbor, bruised.
The police, coming on a riot call had
great difficulty in protecting the street-car
men. but the crowd was finally dispersed
after the patrolmen had used their clubs
â¦

drive against Tennessee Coal, which carried it
down four points, caused a momentary halt
especially in the specialties. Yesterday's strong
upward movement in Tobacco was resumed,
carrying that stock to !31VÂ» and causing sympa
thetic gains of between one to two points In
othf-;- Wdlng specialties.
When it became known after noon that the i
directors of the Continent Tobacco Company
had failed to declare a dividend, as many
speculators had hoped they would, there was a â¢
drop in Tobacco stocks, which reached -\i in ,
American Tobacco. Sugar. Brooklyn Transit
an'! Manhattan responded in sympathy, and a
number of railroads lost a ; Int. The market
drifted rather uncertainly for the rest of the
day, except for some strength in individual
Blocks. The reduction of the dividend rate In
Consolidate! Gas. although it had fully been i
expected; had a bad effect on the market. The â¢
stock itself vibrated feverishly over three
points and closed at a fractional loss. There

Croup of minor granger roads. Realizing was |
In evidence all day in some of the Southern and

The money inarkÂ»t conditions abroad account- |

Chicago Grain Market.
Â« _ $>
CHICAGO, Aug. 24.â The opening in wheat
showed no changes from yesterday's closing
price in either September or December and
with little inclination among traders to at
tempt to force the market In either direction.
The preponderance of sentiment favored the
buying side at first on account of an error in
the Price Current, which estimate made the
total 475.000,000 on the advance of ; 4 d at Liver
pool, and the continued small receipts. â  A
mild covering movement, mostly by local
shorts, caused a slight advance in September
and a more material gain in December, but
before the first hour's trading had ended the
market turned suddenly weak and dropped with
a rapidity that ivaa painfully surprising to
longs. September opened at 72 â  1 72% c and
advanced to 72? 8 0, December opened at 74, ,â 
74 :t sc. and advanced to 74%@74%c. At these
prices a selling movement started that was
much too heavy for the demand. Desire to
Lake profits was apparently the principal mo
tive for most of the liquidation, but a great
ilÂ»>al of professional selling was done when it
became apparent that the market was easily
influenced, and this feature of the market was
taken advantage of by professional scalpers
several times during the day to hammer down
Lhe price. The result was a decidedly nervous
market for most of the session, though trad-
Ing at no time was really heavy. Private
advices in regard to the Northwest crop con
ditions were favorable. September declined to
n*4c and December to 73*i<<i73"j,e. The mar
ket was rallied by the reports of â¢â ! Rood cash
business, but prices were quickly hammered
down again. Corrected figures on the Price
Current estimate made the total wheat crop
50.000.W0 more than first announced. This was
the cause of a weak spot when the figures
were given out, and the market was on the
down grade nt the close, September finishing
at 71*40 ami December. 73 t s c.
Corn was quiet and irregular. September was
Mrong on the excellent shipping business,
which caused a good deal of covering by
shorts. September closed Me higher. Decem
ber closed a shade lower.
The market tor oats was a narrow and
steady one. September dosed 54c higher, De
cember closed higher.
Little was done in- provisions and the mar
ket was practically featureless. Prices ad
vanced somewhat shortly after the opening
with grain. Softness developed later, but in
the afternoon the market firmed up again and
cloned steady. Trading was mostly local. The
cash demand for meats was only moderate. At
the close September pork was a shade higher.

Dried Fruits, Nuts and Raisins.
All fruits except Peaches are firm, and most
kinds are scarce. Prunes continue sluggish
about opening, and the only sales of new crop
thus far ore short sales, and the sellers may
not be able to deliver the goods. A significant
fact In this connection is that a heavy New
York house that made a large sale of old
Prunes last week In now buying some of them
back again at a higher price .than they sold
them for. There are few conditions to make
any dried fruit cheap this year, though the
usual attempts to keep prices low are being
made.'

MILLER DENIES
ANY DESIRE TO
OFFEND MAYOR
Sole Anxiety to Have
Good Streets.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
00$ Broadway, Aug. 24.
Superintendent of Streets Miller does
jot approve of Mayor Snow's criticism
of his actions regarding the tax le\y.
He says he has no idea of running
counter to the Mayor, but that all his
interests are centered in a desire to im
prove the street system.
Mr. Miller said to-day:
The exact language cf my communication to
the City Council In retard to providing funds
for the improvement of main thoroughfares
reads as follows:
â¢â¢I therefore respectfully recommend to your
honorable b.viy that East Fourteenth street.
between Thirteenth avenue and the easterly
city line, and Telegraph avenue, between
Broadway ani Thirty-sixth street, be declared
by the ordinance to be boulevards, and that
an allowance of 12 cents be included in the
park ami boulevard fund of the tax levy about
to be rlxeJ for the express purpose of paying
.-ne-half of the cost or pavtne th- former street
and cf permanently repairing the wornuut i-or
tiur.s of the latter."
In making this request I had no thought of
asking for an increase In the tax levy. I was
simply anxious that s< mewh-re !n the levy
there, should be provided an allowance for this
work, ar.d I believed that it could be best ac
complished through the fund mentioned. It
will be rememberr-i. no dembt, that three years
ago when the question of improving Ea^t
Twelfth street wa." before the Council that
communication after communication was ad
dreseJ to this body by the 5-treet Superintend
ent ani that nearly all the crtan;:eii rÂ»l! j =
In the city. (n?l'.:<i!rig the Board of Trade, Mer
chants' Exchange and other improvement
clubs, took an interest in the matter, and that
the whole fi.sht centered on the question of hay-
Ing an allowance made in the tax levy for the
work.
There 1Â« aiways more or less debate D the
City Council ever fixing the exact amount to
be provided for each fund, and it will not be
known until the levy is actually fixed by the
Council Just how much will be placed in the
park ar.d boulevard fund.
I was summoned to appear before the Coun
cil Committee on Tuesday evening, as were
the heads of ether departments, to discuss this
very matter, and my communication was writ
ton" late Monday afternoon after said notice
had been received. I desired that the matter
should be formally presented at their regu
lar meeting Monday evening so that the ques
tion would be properly before the Council. It
is certainly a well-known fact that the heads
of ail the departments appear before the City
Council each year, net only of their own
volition, but upon the demands or the Coun
cil when the tax levy is being discussed, and
that each man d^es the b-rf.t he can to pre
vail upon the Council to provide as liberally
as ->cFs!ble for his particular department. This
was the sole purpose I had In making; this
recommendation, and any thought of â¢iffendlr.g
the ilaycr personally or the Board of Public
Works Â«as furthermost from my thoughts.
I have never known of the members of the
City Council going either individually or as a
body to the Board of Public Works to dis
cuss matters of this kind pertaJr.lng ' ) the
Street Department.
On the other hand, it is a matter of daily
recurrence for members of the Cour.cil to call
at my office for information and data of one
kind or another, and this is particularly true
during the period of the year when the tax
levy is being discussed. It seems to ha'-e been
assumed by members of the City Council and
the public generally, that the head of the
department, who is devoting i.is whole time
and attention to his official duties, is compara
tively well Informed as regards the details of
Ms work and the necessities of his department.
On June 23 last, a communication was ad-
Jressed to fhe Board of Pusoc Works, stat
r.g substantially thÂ« facta set forth In my
vmmmlcaUon of last Monday to the City
Council, and urging at the same time that
t!-e!r Influence be exerted lr. behalf of this
much-needed work.
I know of no other way Of accomplishing
:he improvement of these thoroughfares at an
early date, except by having provision made
In the tax lÂ«\y of this year's funds, and I
certainly had no thought uf exciting any op
position, much less a persona! attack by the
Mayor, by making an effort in the usual and
rustomary manner to bring about the desired
Work of Philosophical Union.

Fays tne following In regard to disc ha sol
diers:
Traveling allowances to discharged soldiers
are computed hy taking the distance In miles
by the shortest usually traveled route from
place of discharge to that of enlistment and al
lowing one <lay'R pay and subsistence at the
rate of 30 cents for every 20 miles of travel. i
It further gop S on to say â¢-..â¢. transporta
tion has been furnished for any part of the dis
tance that part will be excluded from the com
putation of travel pay. but subsistence â  it the
full distance will be allowed. The Government
was never known to furnish transportation in
kind to a discharged soldier, but always paid
full Travel pay. and that was an Item figured
upon from the day of enlistment. Recruits and
ie-enllsted soliiers would choose a frontier
post, where soMlertng is no picnic, so that at
the end of their enlistment their travel pay,
money saved for clothing not drawn in kind,
et--.. amounted to a neat little sum and has
cften helped men to get a new star", in life.
Some time In January of this year an order
came to Manila tiimed by the Secretary of War
to discontinue giving travel pay to discharged
soldiers, but to furnish them with second-class
passage on a Government transport, or if no
transports are available to furnish second-class
passage <-n sorae llnÂ«>r (before that order came

troops serving in Cuba. Porto Rico. Hawaiian

SON'S AWFUL
CHARGE AGAINST
HIS MOTHER
t
I f
Obtained a, Deed by
Threats. I

. Oakland Office San Francisco Call, â¦
90S Broadway. Aug. 24. â¦
Public Administrator B. C. Haves filed
a most sensational suit in the Superior >
Court late this afternoon against Adolph ?
H. Bauerle for the recovery of valuable â¢$
property belonging to the estate of the I |
latter's mother, the late Mrs. Louisa H. >
Bauerle, who died in this city on the 9th 7
inst. â¦
While the" object of the suit is princi- <*>
pally to have annulled a certain deed, i
wherein the mother transferred to her son X
the title to certain property located In
Ea.st Oakland, the allegations in the com- 7
plaint setting forth the method of fraud '
and undue influence exercised by the son t
over the mother are such as seldom find 4
their way into documents outside of a â¦
divorce complaint. i,
When Mrs. Bauerle died she left prop-
erty valued at about $15,000. Shortly after i
her death her two daughtersâ Mrs. Louisa f
Kromme and Anna Silva â learned that â¦
she had lÂ»ft a ill in thÂ« possession of X
their brother. Adolph H. Bauerle. But
they also discovered that the red mother j â¦
had deeded most of the property to the a
son, who, fearing a contest, refused to
file the will for probate. Then the daugh
ters sought the offices of the Public Ad- <v
ministrator, who promptly petitioned for +
and was granted special letters of admin- [
istratlon. Immediately thereafter Adolph :
H. Bauerle filed the will and asked to be Â¥
appointed executor, as he is named in the 2
instrument, and now the suit riled to-day : '_
is In the way of a contest. *
Pubiie Administrator Hawes alleges in 4
his complaint that at the time Mrs.
Bauerle deeded her property to Adolph *
she was in ill health and incompetent to .3
manage her affairs and that while in this
condition the son. through threats that he Â«
"would expos her criminal relations with 8
one Henry Meyer in 1894." induced her to j
sign the deed. The complaint further *
specifies and quotes the exact language ,i
which Adolph Bauerle is alleged to have
uttered during one of these spasmodic ,
threats in these words: "I'll let every one i 'â¢
know about the affair. I'll let every one 1
know some of the dirty tricks you have
been doing." i
Such threats, declares the special ad- m
ministrator, caused the mother to be
thrown into hysterics, which was fol
lowed by illness and which eventually
resulted in her deeding to her accusing
son much of her valuable property. It is 1
asked that the deed be declared null and j
void.
Celebrct on Notes.
Among the cabin passengers on the
Sherman are three youths of tender years.
who must have opened their eyes wide
with wonder at the reception which wss
accorded the transport yesterday. The}
belong to wealthy and Influential faml- '
lies of the island of Negros, and they
have been sent to this country by their !
parents, who are friendly to "1. Ameri- i
canos," for the purpose of being edu- j
cated. They are under the guardianship j
of Father McKinnon, who will place them !
in some college.
The California regiment attributes the
splendid trip it has had over to the bene- ;
ficent influence which has been exercised !
in its behalf by the following mascots, j
who have worked right and day to fulfill !
the requirements of their position. The
boys consider that, owing to the splendid
service they have rendered they deserve i
special recognition.' They are "Hard â 
Luck Pete," "Fleas." "Skibly" and "Kick- '
apoo." four Filipino dogs; "Butts," a !
goat; "The Parson," a fawn; an assorted;
lot of several hundred monkeys with \
names too numerous to mention, ditto par- j
rots, ditto canary birds, "Victory," an I
eagle, and a job lot of cats.
The Call tlew the American flag- higher
yesterday .an it has ever been flown be
fore. When the whistles blew the signal I
for the formation of the bay parade three '
large box kites, constructed especially for
The Call, were given to the breeze from |
the top of the Mills building. Between the 'â 
kites fluttered a large flag. The kites
mounted steadily in the brisk wind, and l
when the Sherman passed below them
had attained an altitude of 4000 feet. The
flag, which according to measurement was '
at lea- 2500 feet high, was almost invlsi- â 
ble. Over two miles of wire was reeled !
out in reaching this elevation. The kite
flying was in charge of A. M A lee, who I
was ably assisted by H. T. Dodge and W
Scholl.
The Filipino band has been secured by
the Native Sons and Daughters to play
on the grand- stand opposite the City Hall j
during the time that the night parade j
shall pass. ,
v ar has no right to take away anything Con
grc-s save us. But to free, themselves from
blame and be good fellows they are now hold- !
ing out that money to us as a "bait." They j
offer us that money on condition that we re
enlist, enslave ourselves for three years more.
Just as if three months' soldiering In the Phil
ippines wasn't enough to satisfy any man. Of
<"ourÃe some fish will bite at anythingâ so they
bite at the travel pay (which is ours any way)
and get caught. But those wise enough to get
out dent yet off without punishment. They
are aliened to steerage passage on an army
transport, even if their former rank entitled
them to first-class cabin. The Red Cross
nurseÂ«. members of the postal service and
needy Filipinos travel first-class; there la room
for them when there is none for discharged
men. It matters not whether one is a hospital
steward or a dishonorably discharged soldier.
U's> the same, steerage.
It would take hi. too much time and space
to describe the life of a discharged soldier on
a United States transport: one would think
that we were political prisoners sentenced to
Siberia by the mighty Czar Instead of Ameri
can citizens, whose only crime Is that they
were aoliVern and would not re-enlist to serve
in the Phil!; :
A terrible rime, is it not? It isn't sufficient
that these men have all braved hardships,
diseases and the enemy's bullets uncomplain
ingly and been robbed of travel pay in the bar
gain It Isn't sufficient punishment to hold
theni in the army after their contract had ex
pired. These men were a!: held against their
will and all rerxirts to the contrary notwith
standing. It Isn't sufficient punishment that
these men were held after being discharged
under pretext that tl-Te wasn't room for them
on the three transports that left Manila., which
Is a poor "â  ise it best. All these men are j
anxious to return to their families and voca
tions, to take up life where they left off. But
no: they must wait until It will please some
official In authority to grant a bit of space
below three hatches down In the hold (this In j
lieu of travel pay> and subsistence enough to
bold body and soul together.
All they? are not. sufficient punishment, but
the men must be sacrificed to military rules,
and when It pleased that walking hogshead of

The quartermaster Is the one supposed to '>
have charge of us and provide us with quar- !
ters and rations ; he gave us quarters as stated ,
above, but we never got rationsâ l mean the
full ration the Government allows. We sal
dom got sufficient food to satisfy our hunger, '

(one of dirt), spoiled water called coffee for !
courtesy and heated dough (called bread) con

board fared better because they had funds iic- j
cumulated from savings on rations.
Vow what we want to know Is what became ;
our pavings? During our stay at Nagasaki â¢
and Yokohama none of the discharged men ate |
on hoard a saving nt six days' rations for 254
men a total of 1024 rations, which is worth,
according to Government value, $381. Add to
this savings made while we were on board
and see if the quartermaster would have lost
any money by giving us macaroni when the
troops' had it. or giving us the same bread the
troops had 'I mean the bread with the raisins).

OAKLAND, Aug. 24.â The compulsory

STREETCARS
TO BE STOPPED
After the bay celebration was all over
yesterday afternoon the executive com
mittee held a short meeting at Mayor
Phelan's office to discuss some changes in
the programme that had been suggested
and to arrange for a banquet for the
lowa boys after the parade. It was an
nounced that General Shafter and Ad
miral Kautz were at Monterey and would
not be able to be present at the celebra
tion to-day tut would probably be on
hand to-morrow nierht. A message from
Captain Terry of the lowa said that he
could not be in town at all, and Lieuten
ant Wetzel appeared before the committee
as his representative. Lieutenant Wetzel
suid that hie ordrs from Captain Terry
were that the boys of the lowa might par
ticipate in the parade, but that under no
circumstances could they be granted ahore
leave in a body.
The procession to-day will brgin at 10:30
o'clock, and the committee decided to
communicate with < "hief of Police Lees
and renuest hint to hold un all street cars
along the line of march after 10:30 o'clock.
The following letter was addressed to
him:
Mr I. W. Lees. Chief of Police, Qtyâ Dear
Sir; Please Bee that there is nu â¢-â hstrurtion or.

The night parade starts at S o'clock. Please

where I expected to end my business life.

J. J. Carroll, the proprietor of the
Louvre under the Macdonough Theater,
also has his story to tell. "It knocked me
out of exactly $3000 when I was given no

wer charged to place the decorations in po

what they thought appropriate and sug

they hoisted a large sign on which was
painted the word "Welcome" and sus

FOR OAKLAND
Made a Holiday as a
Matter of Course.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Aug. 24.
To-day was practically a holiday in
Oakland, not because of any proclama
tion, but because the people treated It
as such and the merchants, bankers and '
civic officials were naturally forced to ;
fall into line.
The balloon that ascended from The
Call office last night gave the signal for
rejoicing, and there will be no surcease
till Sunday. This city was never so will
ingly a part of San Francisco as at pres
ent. Although It was well known that
there would be no demonstration of any
kind last night thousands of people went
to San Francisco and every train since
has been loaded to its full capacity.
Superintendent of Schools McClymonds
concluded it would be a good thins to
close the public schools from last night
to Monday morning, and he issued the ;
order. At the last meeting of the Board
of Education the superintendent was au
thorized to close the schools "on the day |
of the parade." This would have been]
to-morrow, but Mr. McClymonds is not â 
troubled by such a trifle as an order of
his Board "of Education, and later he |
may have to make an explanation to
i Director Redington.

Hotel She Bought Had
"Stuffed" Rooms.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 24.
If the allegations made in a complaint
filed in the Superior Court this afternoon
by Attorney H. Shafter Aldrlch, on behalf
of aged Mrs. Sarah Rose, can be relied
upon, as incontrovertible, she has been
victimized out of the several hundred
dollars to which she looked for comfort
in her. declining years by Alfred D. and
Phoebe A. HcNevin and G. A. Stevens,
who are described in the complaint as
"sharp, shrewd business people, smooth,
slick and designing, of polished and per
suasive manners, appearance and ad
dress."
Against this trio the plaintiff, aged TO
years, of weak sight and suffering from
mental and physical affliction, evidently
was no match. In her complaint Mrs. Rose
alleges:
That on July 5. IS?9. defendants. McNevins
and George A. Stevens, through fraud, trick
and device an! with intent to swindle and â 
cheat plaintiff, induced plaintiff to purchase
the fixtures and furnishings of a certain lodg
ing-house at Tic Eighth street, for $700. when
they well knew at the time that said fixtures
and furnishings were not worth more than $300; ;
that they also presented that the place was ;
a going one and would give plaintiff a good :
living and $100 per month clear.
Relying upon the representations on account
of the lady-like appearance of Phoebe A. M â -
Kevin and the gentlemanly appearance and
polished manners of A D McNevin and G. A.
Stevens, and on account of the nice, slick and :
plausible way in which they explained she i
could make a good living she paid over to de- i
fendants $300 in cash, giving her promissory
note in the sum of MOO., together with a mort- ;
gage as security to cover the balance.
Mrs. Rose soon realized the alleged j
fraud, and believes now that the room-?
at the alleged lodging-house were
"stuffed" at the time she purchased,
hence she now seeks a decree to have the
note and mortgage declared null, as hav
ing been executed and delivered on fraud
ulent representations and without consid
eration, and asks that the defendants be
ordered to refund to her the $3Â» cash paid .

FARCE WOULD
BE WELCOMED
THE true American comedy, comedy
drama and romantic play seem to
be so well on the way toward per- â 
mar.ent success that it is time for :
seme one to arise in our midst and
carpenter a farce with other than a
French hammer. Let him see that it is
not beamed with the chemical bionde, â 
with song and dance, who gives her man- \
ager the slip to elope with the susceptible
saphead inventor to lie complications into
the biff-bang action that follows, the man
who makes his exists crashingly through ;
glass and the dog who nourishes his right
ing temper on the male trouser-leg and
coat-tail. Though many a tough old farce
Jacobite will yield up these traditions
grudgingly, it may be stated without fear
of immediate contradiction that there art
other ways of being funny. A close ob
server of the daily life of the world will
tlnd much that is frivolous and ridiculous
at his very door, and these truths exag
gerated in the telling might become so
interestingly farcical.
Stapleton's farce, "A Bachelor's Honey
moon," is a good one constructed on ihe
old traditional lines, but with a conces
sion of something novel here and some
thing unexpected there that lift it some
above its pattern. Barbara, the maiii
with her front hair curled around frag
ments of valuable missing information,
and the daughters who wear mourning for
a father morally dead, are a refutation .if
the notion that there is nothing new un
der the sun. Barbara, Verne Castro, has
the fresh look oT the unroLigedâ as though j
a day's brisk sweeping had lashed a Ine ;
color into her cheeks. Since she plainly
does nothing but read detective tales and
answer the call beil gradually, the rapid
circulation effect adds to the fun.

t / OF THE I
COULD GET NO
DIVORCE, THOUGH
WIFE DESERTED
Bushnell Idly Burned
Her Letters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Aug. 24.
Although his wife in reality deserted
him years ago. William Bushnell was de
nied a decree of divorce from Anna Bush
nell to-day by Superior Judge Ellsworth.
Bushnell in his complaint alleged deser
tion as the ground for his cause of action,
and there seemed little doubt that the
story he told on the witness stand was
true in every particular, yet the stern In
tention of the law precluded him from
: obtaining the coveted legal separation be
cause the letters by which he might easily
' have proved desertion had been destroyed
by him in a thoughtless moment.
Ten years ago the couple were married
in England, and two years later Bushnell
came to America to seek new fields in
which to reap a fortune. His frugal hab
its and willingness to work early and late
Boon gave promise of bright prospects and
:he sent for his wife and little one. Mrs.
Bushnell was not long in hurrying to
â  America to join her husband, but she soon
declared herself as not delighted with
American people and their manner? So
about five years ago she returned to her
I old home in England. Bushnell willingly
: defraying all expenses, with the under
' standing that some day the wife might
j change her opinion of Americans and re
turn to him. After a few years of corre
,' spondence and after numerous letters
wherein she declared she would never
. again visit America all communication,
i ceased, and recently BusTinell sued for a
, divorce.
But because no one had known his wife
; and no witness could be found who was
; cognizant of the desertion, and because
the all-Important letters had been de
stroyed, he could obtain no decree.
Victor Perl, who sued his wife. Eliza
beth Perl, for a divorce on the ground of
extreme cruelty, was more fortunate. He
is a pattern-maker, and for several years
has occupied rooms at the Galindo Hotel
with his alleged cruel spouse until during
the latter part of last year, when she be
] gan basking in the smiles of other men
j while her husband was away. On one oc-
I casion she did not return to their rooms
i until 3 a. m., and when the outraged hus
band remonstrated she flew into a rage
: and struck him with a shoe. Then fol
, lowed other abuses until Perl was forced
' to secure other rooms, since when, he tes
â  tified, the wife had gone from bad to
worse. Judge Ogden promptly granted a
decree.
Harriet E. Klatzl. the charming opera
singer, who at present is touring with a
company in the East, was also granted a
' divorce by Judge Ogden to-day from
Frederick J. Klatzl on the ground of de
sertion, and if the truant Frederick can
be found the court directs that he con
| tribute $5 monthly toward the support of
the minor child, whose custody is award-
to the mother. Klatzl is also an actor,
; and when last heard from was performing
;in a San Francisco theater. Two yea.\-3
ago he deserted the fair Harriet.
Barbara Botts has been granted a legal
i separation from James B. Botts on the
1 ground of desertion, and is again free to
resume her maiden name, Josephine Bar
bara Parker.
Manuel S. Bettenc->urt, who was granted
a divorce from Maria S. Bettencourt last
: January, has been cited to appear before
'. Judge Ellsworth on the morning of Sep
. tember 11 to , show cause why he should
not be adjudged guilty of contempt In not
â  obeying the order directing him to pay to
i defendant or her attorney. Frank B. Jo
sephs, the sum of $50 on account of attor
ney's fees.
The divorce suit of Maddalena Ghirar
delli against Antonio Ghirardelli was dis
. missed to-day at the request of plaintiff.

BY DYNAMITE
English Scientists Believe They Can
Make IMamonds.
"Diamonds Made by Dynamite" would
be a queer sign on a jeweler's window,
but queer things are hound to happen in
an a^e of electric furnaot-s on the one
hand and liquefied hydrogen on the other.
After close study of the South African
diamond fields scientists formed the the
ory that diamonds were made In nature's
laboratory fr->m carbon liquefied by enor
mous heat and pressure, and dissolved in
iron, from which they crystallized out In
cooling.
By calculation it was found that this
would requires a temperature of about
legrees centigrade <~-"2 degrees Fah
renheit), and a pressure of fifteen tons to
the square inch. Moissan of Paris and
other experimenters have produced crys
tals by imitating this process as closely
as possible, but they were too small and
imperfect to have any value as jewels.
Some other process must be discovered
whereby carbon and iron can be subjected
to an enormous heat and pressure before
â¢we fan hope to produce diamonds on a
commercial srale.
In this condition Professor Crookes has
suggested that "In th^ir researches on
the gases formed from fired gunpowder
and cordite Sir Frederick Abel and Sir
Andrew Noble obtained in closed steel
cylinders pressures as great as ninoty-five
tons to the square Inch and temperatures
as high as 4000 degrees centigrade." Here,
then. If the observations are correct, we
have sufficient temperature and pressure
to liquefy carbon, and if the temperature
could only be allowed to act for a suffi
cient time on the carbon there is little
doubt that the artificial formation of
diamonds would soon pass from the
microscopic stage to a scale more likely
to satisfy the requirements of science. In

MILLION AND HALF IN
GOLD FROM KLONDIKE
Steamer Portland Brings Back
Many Miners.
None of the Prospectors Carried Much
Dust, But All Had Big Drafts,
Cape Nome Very Rich.
rpilE Alaska Commercial Company s j
I steamer Portland arrived from St. ,
I Michael last night with 163 gold hunt- j
ers and two officers and forty-nine men
of the Fourteenth Infantry and Third Ar
tillery. There was very little wealth
among the passengers, but in twelve large
there was v million and a half In
gold dust for the company. A large
in of it originally belonged to the
passengers, but they sold It to the com
pany i"T drafts which are much easier
to carry than gold dust.
The following passengers came from
Cape Nomeâ John Clifford, Mrs. Dr.
Brigham, J. D. Morgan, Denis Vignolt j
and W. H. Winters. The richest man In
the party Is J. D. Morgan. He has a
numbtr of rich claims at the cape and
says the field Is all that it is cracked up j
to" be. For three miles along the beach
men are working down to the waters
odge and are doing well. In fact more
pr.ld dust is txMng taken out of the ocean
beach than out of the claims on Anvil
OreÂ«k.
The returning miners say that there is
going tn be a great deal of hardship in
Anvil City this winter. There Is no fuel
t drift wood and the lumber brought
mi sailing vessels, and the supply I
is not going to last very long. Such men
as C. D. Lane have laid in a good sup
ply of wood and coal, and their hands j
will he all right if some miners do i.ot
turn to and help themselves when the |
freeze ccmes.
Everything was very quiet at Dawson |
when the miners who came down on the
â  ::.l left. All the news they bring
has been distributed by those who came
out over the trails, however. Those who
came down from St. Michaels areâ ii. L.

MARTHA DAVIS IN TROUBLE.
Her Master Tried to Evade an Inspec
tion and Must Break Open the
Main Hatch.
The American bark Martha Davis Is In
trouble by reason of an attempt of her
master to evade the new law which pro
vides that all sailing vessels of more than
100 tons shall be inspected and licensed by
the United States inspectors of local and
foreign steam vessels before clearing. The
bark had taken on a cargo for Honolulu
last Wednesday, and the master went to
the Custom-house for his clearance pa
pers, but they were refused him because
his vessel had not been inspected. He was
in a great hurry to get away, and he em
ployed a Custom-house broker to accom
pany him to the office of the United
Stales inspectors to request that he be
granted a special permit to sail without
the formality of an Inspection, but the
Inspectors replied that it was their duty
to make a thorough examination of the
vessel's hull. They ordered yesterday that
the cargo be taken out of the main 'hatch
and a sufficient quantity removed to allow
them to Inspect the hull. This work will
be done to-day.
The bark was built in East Boston in
1573 and is registered at $70 tons gross.

Provisions From the Warren Saved
the Crew From Starvation.
ASTORIA, Aug. 24.â The long over
due British *hip Mac Duff reached pert
i to-night, after a passage of 192 days
i from Shanghai. This is the longest
trip on record. She was delayed by
calms in the tropics, where her hull be
came covered with a dense growth of
i seaweed and barnacles. She also en
-1 countered a typh< i, but rode through
it safely. Further north head winds
were experienced.
When the transport "Warren fur
nished the Mac Duff with provisions 500
miles off the cr.ast her stores were ex
hausted and the timely appearance of
i the Warren alone saved the crew from
starvation. The ship was so com
pletely covered with weeds and bar
nacles that the tug Wallula could
scarcely tow her into port.

DANGEROUS FIRE IN
THE LUMBER DISTRICT
Forty-Two Thousand Feet Went
Up in Smoke.
Scott & Van Arsdale and the Humboldt
Company Heavy Losersâ Prompt Work
of Department Prevented Its
Spread,
Cjfra FEW minutes before 12 o'clock
A FEW minutes before out o'clock
last night nre broke out In the
jL â i\ lumber yards of Scott & Van Ars
n dale, on Fifth street, between Bry
ant and Brannan, and before the
flames were under control they had com
municated to the adjoining yards of the
Humboldt Lumber Company and de
stroyed 42,000 feet of lumber.
The blaze was first discovered by Frank
Vocassel, an employe of the Humboldt
Lumber Company, who lives near the
yards. He saw a blaze shoot up from a
corner of a pile of lumber and at once
notified Michael Stroth. a watchman for
Scott & Van Arsdale. Stroth ran toward
I the nearest box, but Policeman McDowell,
who had also seen the blaze, arrived at
; the box first and turned in an alarm.
By this time the flames had completely
i enveloped a large stack of lumber and had
-, caught to the fence dividing the two
: yards. The flickering light on the sky
attracted the attention of thousands of
! sightseers along Market street and the
Streets leading to the scene were In a few
minutes filled with an eager, jostling
throng, which so impeded progress of the
tire apparatus that many people narrowly
escaped injury.
OVER ONE HUNDRED
PROBABLY LOST
Additional Reports of Disaster From
the Storm Along the
Hatteras Coast.
NORFOLK, Va., Aug. 24.â 1t is now
i thought that the number of people who
lost their lives by shipwreck and dis
aster attending the West Indian hur-
I ricane which passed up the coast about
i ten days ago will reach 100. Accounts.
' in many respects conflicting', continue
to come from the Albemarle and Pam
i lioo Sound region and the coast from
1 Hattoras to Boyds Island, in which sec
j tion the greater number of casualties
occurred. As this section of water is
i the artery for snail craft from the re
> glon tributary to Chesapeake Bay and
as far north as Philadelphia and south
to Crporgia the number of vessels tra
i versing these inland seas is always
great.
Masters of craft in from that region
Ftato that schooners. Dungies, sloops
I and fishing craft wrecked, ashore,
broken up. sunk or turned over are to
\ ho seen almost hourly in a trip through
tho sounds and it is thought that the
total drowned will run close to 100, if
It does not even reach it.
On Swan, Hog and other islands in
the vicinity of Portsmouth, Big and
Little Kinnaket, Ocracoke and smaller
points fully sixty to seventy houses.
i four or five churches and numerous
stores, barns and warehouses were
either washed away or damaged beyond
repair. As a result numbers are home
less and destitute and many others
have lost crops and flocks. Stock and
implements and the fishing interests
have suffered greatly.
WILL STOP PAYMENT
OF CUBAN SOLDIERS
General Brooke Resolves to Put an
End to Thievery and Attempted
Swindling.
HAVANA. Aug. 24.â General Brooke has
virtually decided not to make any pay
ments to Cuban troops on the basis of tne
additional rolls. The first payments
brought to light such an amount of thiev
ery and attempted swindling that he has
ceased to consider the question of distrib
uting what is left of the $3,fKK),000 in sup
plementary payments. The sum now left
in his hands he will probably use to assist
wounded and deserving officers, who un
der the original arrangement were to re
ceive nothing.
Most of the Cuban officials agree with a
remark recently made by General Gomez.
He said the $3,000,000 would prove more
harmful than helpful, and the work of
payment has revealed the depths of de
pravity that Ihe best friends of Cuba had
not conceived could exist.
GAME ENDS IN MURDER.
A Saloon-keeper in Idaho Is Fatally
Stabbed by a Miner.
LEWISTON, Idaho, Aug. 24.â Word
reached here to-day of the murder of
Charles Larrabee, a saloonkeeper at
Buffalo Hump, by James Long, a miner,
on Tuesday evening. The men had
quarreled In a gambling game, but it
was thought had settled the difficulty.
A few minutes later Larrabee and
Long walked out of the tent saloon
together apparently In a good humor.
Suddenly Long stabbed Larrabee twice,
one of the wounds penetrating the kid
neys from the back. Larrabee died
Wednesday afternoon. Long arrived at
Mount Idaho, the county seat, last
evening and gave himself up to the au
thorities. Larrabee is well-known in
Northern Idaho. His agfnl mother is
living at West Superior, Wis.
MAY NOT RESIGN.
Emperor William Refuses to Permit
the Cabinet to Quit Its
Office.
BERLIN. Aug. 24.â The correspondent
here of the Associated Press learns
authoritatively that Emperor William has
refused to accept the Cabinet's resigna
tion. Later, however, a partial reorgani
zation of the ministry will be made. The
position of Dr. yon Miquel. the vice
president of the Council of Ministers and
Prussian Minister of Finance, is an
strong as ever, and this shows the im
-1 probability of dissolution.
When the firemen arrived the flames had
spread to such an extent that it was
deemed advisable to send in a second
alarm. The whole inside of the block is
filled with lumber piles, flanked on the
outside with rickety shanties and auper
annunted warehouses. A strong breeze
was springing up, and had the fire g;iined
a linn headway it would have swept the
whole southeast section of the city. The
firemen rushed bravely in among the
smoking, tottering piles of lumber at the
risk of their lives and in half an hour the
fire was under control.
The cause of the blaze is unknown but
many theories are advanced. It is said
that a crowd collected on the lumber piles
early in the evening to get a good view
fe*** **â¢*â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ PS a*
of the illumination on the bay. Many of
the men and boys were smoking and it
Is possible that a live cigar or cigarette
stump may have started the fire. Another
story is that these '.-ame parties set off
a quantity of fireworks from the top of
the pile and these are responsible for thÂ»
damage, while others say the lumber yard
has been a nightly rendezvous for tramps
and low characters who smoked freely
among the piles of wood.
The loss will amount to about $5000, di
vided between Scott & Van Arsdale and
Korbel Brothers, owners of the Humboldt
Lumber Company's yards.
CONSUL BEDLOE HAS
BEEN SUSPENDED
Accused of Having Given a Certifi
cate of American Registry
to a Filibuster.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24.â Consul Ed
ward Bedloe of Pennsylvania, who has
been stationed at Canton. China, during
the administration of President McKinley,
has been suspended by the State Depart
ment and granted permission to return to
the United States.
Dr. Bedloes trouble is not due to
charges of giving aid to the Filipinos,
but arises in part out of the certificate of
I American ownership said to have been
granted by him to the steamer Abbey.
The Abbey was seized by the gunboat
McCulloch on September 23 of last year at
Batangas, where she had landed a cargo
of arms and ammunition. A Philade]
phian, understood to have been interested
in the Abbey's filibustering expedition
says that Mr. Bedloe gave the vessel a
certificate of American ownership, and
she departed to Macao.
The authorities feel assured that Dr.
Redloe is innocent of any wrongdoing, in
tentionally at I-ast. and ttiat only some
misunderstanding exists on his' part.
There is no explicit legal authority. It is
said, for granting such a certificate as
was given by Dr. Bedlop to the Abbey,
but the consular regulations authorize the
issue on the ground that it is reasonable
and proper that American citizens should
be afforded the protection given by such
certificates and by the right to fly the
American flag over their vessels.
EDMONTON SURVIVORS.
Many who Escaped Death on the
Horrible Trail Reach Victoria.
VICTORIA. B. C. Aug. 24.-The steamer
<"'ottagfi City arrived at 1 a, m. Among
the passengers were forty unfortunates,
survivors of the Edmonton route, who
bring a various assortment of hard luck
stories. Many are crippled from their
sufferings. But one more contingent Is to
j come, for which the steamer Strathcona
was to go up on the Stickeen to-day to
bring passengers from Wrangei. Then all
who lived through the sufferings of that
death trap will have reached civilization.
This will clean up all the survivors. The
passengers on the Cottage City report the
death at Olenora a week ago of Hiram
Wells, formerly a politician of Missouri
B. Tennyson, nephew of the late Lord
Alfred, was a passenger from Casslar
He said that a railway is being built from
Olenora into that district. There Is con
siderable gold there, and rich strikes have
been made on Thibert Creek; but outside
of that, although there are opportunities
I for rich hydraulicking, it 1b no poor man's

MORMON COLONISTS.
Extensive Concessions Granted Them
by Mexican Government.
AUSTIN. Tex., Aug. 24.â Louis D. Ma
son of Salt Lake City was here to-day on
his way home from Mexico, where he
claims to have obtained the concession for
the establishment of two large Mormon
colonies in the Nazes River Valley, State
Of I'urango. He expects to locate not less
j than 20,000 Mormon colonists at the places
j selected under the terms of the concession
within the noxt two years.
The colonists will be exempt from the
payment of duties on farm implements
| machinery, construction material, house
-1 hold effects and domestic animals, and
; also exempted from export duties on any
products of the colony for a term of ten
years, Mr. Mason stated that the coloni
zation project had the sanction of the
Mormon church, and that most of the col
onists will go from Salt Lake City. There
are already four large and prosperous
Mormon colonies in Northern Mexico.

LONDON, Aup. 24.â Cnnsiderahlp alarm
â was created yesterday evening by a man
throwing a lPtter into Quepn Victoria's
rarriape as she- was driving into Osbourne,
Isle of Wipht. A rumor spread to the
effect that the letter contained an explo
sive, but this turned out to be false. The
police arrested the man. whose letter was
only an appeal to her Majesty to secure
for him a new trial of a civil suit which
he recently lost. The prisoner was found
to be a German, who was not aware that
his action was against the law. As It was
evident that he had no intention to do
harm the man was released. The Queen
was surprised when the letter fell in her
lap, but she betrayed no alarm.

No Immediate Prospects of a China-

PEKING, Auk. 25.â The Japanese

Apparently it has accomplished noth

Prince Ching favors an alliance with
