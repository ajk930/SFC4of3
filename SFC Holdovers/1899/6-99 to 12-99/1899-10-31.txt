SILENCING BIG BOER GUNS COSTS
THE LIVES OF MANY TROOPS
Shelling of Ladysmith Causes the
Combined British Forces Under
General White to Sally Forth
and Attack the Enemy.
Losses Are Heavy on Both Sides, and the British
Are Again Puzzled by the Tactical Skill of
Joubert's Men--Mules and Guns Fall Into
the Hands of Boers.
LONDON, Oct. 31. â There is considerable speculation in London as to the strength
of the opposing forces at Ladysmith. The British have 15,000 men. With regard to the Boer
force the estimates van*. The Morning Post says 30,000, the Standard 18,000 and the Daily
Mail 17.000.
The Standard summarizes the news as follows: "General White's official estimate of
the Boer loss at Glencoe is 500 killed and wounded. All doubt as to the guns captured at
Glencoe is set at rest by General White's statement that three Boer guns were dismounted or
disabled and left at the top of the hill. The Boers have succeeded in capturing 1500 mules,
which is a serious loss in a country where beasts of burden are difficult to obtain."
LONDON, Oct. 31. â The
Daily Telegraph has the
following account of the
Ladysmith engagement from its
special correspondent at the
front :
"An indecisive reconnoissance

George Stewart White advanced

available forces from Ladysmith,

WHITE'S REPORT OF THE
BATTLE WITH THE BOERS
British Commander of the Troops at Ladysmith
Practically Admits That He Sustained
Heavy Losses
LONDON, Oct an.â Tb* War Office here has received a dispatch which says General White has foupht an engage
ment, presumaViiy with Genera] Joubert's forces, which wore pushed hack after several hours' fighting. The British lost
about 100 mÂ»n and the Boer losses were much greater. The Boers were in grreater number and had better artillery.
General White's dispatch, which was dated 4:30 p. m. to-day, read:
"I .-mployed all the troops here except the obligatory garrison before the works. I sent a mountain
battery, the Royal Irish Fusileers and the Gloucesters to take up a position on the hills to clear my left
flank. The J orce moved at 11 o'clock yesterday evening, and during some night firing, the battery mules
6tampeded with some of the guns, which, however, I hope to recover. These two battalions have not yet re
turned, but they are expected this afternoon.
"I detailed two brigade divisions of field artillery and five battalions of infantry aided by cavalry un
der General French to attack a position upon which the enemy yesterday mounted guns. We found this position
evacuated, but our force was attacked with considerable vigor with what I believe were General Joubert's
troops. They had many guns and showed in great numbers. Our troops were all in action and we pushed the
enemy back several miles, but did not succeed in reaching his laager. Our losses are estimated at between 80
and 100, but those of the enemy must have been much greater, the fire of our guns appearing very effective.
"After being in action several hours I withdrew the troops, and they returned unmolested to their
cantonments. The enemy are in great number, and their guns range further than our fiejd guns.
"I now have some naval guns which have temporarily silenced and I hope will permanently dominate
the enemy's best juns, with which he has been "bombarding the town at a range of over 6000 yards.
The San Francisco Call.
The losses on the Boer side were
considerable."
LADYSMITH, Oct. 30.â Fir
ing commenced at 5 o'clock this
morning, the Boers shelling
Ladysmith with forty-pounders.
An advance of the British
forces was made at dawn, with
the object of shelling the Boers
from the position where yester
day they had mounted a number
!of guns. On reaching the spot,
however, it was found that they
had evacuated the position.
The British continued to ad
vance, and the movement devel
oped into a reconnoissance in :
force. The enemy were posted
on a range of hills having a front
age of about sixteen miles. The
i British force -was disposed in the
following order: On the right,
three regiments of cavalry, iour
batteries of the Royal Field Ar
tillery and five battalions of infan
try; in the center, three batteries
' of the Royal Field Artillery, two
regiments of cavalry and four in
fantry battalions; on the left, the
Royal Irish Fusileers, the Glou
cestershire regiment and the
Tenth Mountain Battery. This
force had been detailed to guard
the English left flank at a late
hour last night. General White's
plan of operations was that as the
movement developed the force
constituting the center, which
was disposed under cover of a
kopje about three miles from the
town, should throw itself ujx>n
the enemy, while the left flank
was being held by the Fusileers
and the Gloucesters. The scheme
was well devised but failed in ex
ecution, owing to the fact that
the Boer position which formed
the British objective had been
evacuated.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1899.
The British artillery quickly
reduced the volume of the en
emy's fire, but the attack deliv
ered on the right flank was the
principal one, and the column
was compelled to charge. The
I Boer attack had been silenced for
a time, and the British infantry
advanced, covered by cavalry.
The enemy now began to develop
a heavy counter attack, and as
they were in great numerical su
periority General White gave or
ders for the infantry to be gradu
ally withdrawn. The movement
was carried out with great steadi
'; ness and deliberation, under cover
of the British guns, which made
excellent practice.
Some shells were thrown into
the town from the Boers forty
pounders at a range of over 6000
1 yards, but no damage was done.
The engagement lasted several ,
hours, and resulted, on the Brit
. ish side, in casualties estimated at
I from 80 to 100. The Boer losses
! must largely have exceeded this
total.
The attack was admirably de
livered by the British right, and

BRITISH TROOPS
WERE REPULSED
Garrison at Mafeking Made an
Unsuccessful Bayonet At
tack on Boers.
LOURENZO MARQUEZ, Delagoa Bay, Oct. 30.â A dispatch received here
to-day under date of October 28 pays General Cronje the Boer commander,
announced there that the British garrison at Mafeking made a bayonet
attack on Commandant Louw'g laager near Grandstand, but were repulsed,
leaving six dead on the field, and it was believed that many of the at
tacking party were wounded. The dispatch adds that Saturday morning
Colonel Baden-Powell asked for an armistice In order to bury the dead. Gen
eral Cronje consented to this, the Boers assisting In placing the dead in the
wacon going to Mafeking.
LONDON". Oct. 30.â The latest news from the western border has appar
ently assured the British authorities as to the ability of Mafeking and Kimber
ley to withstand assaults.
A dispatch from Fort Tuli, forwarded during the evening of October 24, an
nounced that Blackburn's force In the skirmish at Rhodes Drift killed twelve
Boers.
A Kaffir spy reported that many Boers were lying In the Drift dying. Black
burn died of his wounds on returning to Fort Tuli. Scouts there report that the
Boers are concentrating strongly on the Rhodeslan border with Maxims.
A War Office dispatch from Cape Town, dated October 26. says an armored
train under Llewellyn got within 1900 yards of the Boer laager, three miles south
of Crocodile port. The Boers had driven in their horses on the approach of the
train. Three Maxim volleys were discharged into the Boers, who must have
had considerable loss. They returned ten shots with no effect. Colonel Plumers
outpost had several skirmishes on the Crocodile River.
From later advices it was learned that the Llewellyn train returned to Mo
chudi, 100 miles north of Mafeking. Llewelyn reports all quiet.
pressed, sent to their assistance
the whole center column with the
exception of the Devonshire regi
ment.
The battle had then lasted four
hours, during which the artillery
fire on both sides had been almost
incessant. The Naval Brigade,
which landed at Durban, had ar
rived on the scene toward the end
of the fight, and they immediately
brought their heavy guns into
play. Their practice was magnifi
cent. At the fourth shot the en
emy's forty-pounders had been
knocked out of action.
The town is now freed from
apprehension of bombardment.
Throughout the engagement the
Boers held their ground with
courage and tenacity, and, con
sidering the intensity of the Brit
ish artillery fire, they must have
suffered severely.
DEADLY FIRE OF
THE BOER ARTILLERY
LONDON, Oct. 31.â Mr. Stevens, the war
correspondent of the Dally Mall, describ
ing the engagement at Ladysmlth, says:
"By 10 o'clock the British had driven
the Boers back several miles, when the
retirement was ordered, which Sir Arch
ibald Hunter conducted with great skill,
retiring battalion by battalion, cohering
the movement with the artillery of their
guns by alternate batteries. The Boer ar

tllleryâfield, quick firing and slegre gun*â
Immediately opened a heavy flre all
around, showing their, knowledge of war
by aiming at the guns and wagons as
they retired. Little damage was done,
however, and our operations were quite
unflurried.
"At the end of the action a bearer com
pany advanced under a Red Cross flag
to Beck the wounded and was fired upon
by the Boers, apparently through a mis
apprehension or because of want of dis
cipline since the fire soon ceased. In the
meantime the native bearers continued
their advance, their cool bravery .being
most praiseworthy. All the troops retired
In safety and pickets were left on the
field."
Except a vague reference in the Stand
ard, none of the special dispatches make
mention of the missing battalions, state
ments regarding them evidently having
been censored.
The correspondent of the Times at
Lady smith says:
"The action seemed to be proceeding
most satisfactorily when, at 7:15 a. m., the
enemy in largenumbers, with field guns,
Maxims and 37-millimeter guns, began to
develop a heavy attack on Colonel Grim
wood's infantry. The cavalry brigade
had moved #ip on our right, holding the
parallel ridge over against Colonel Grim
wood's position and practically acting as
infantry. In the meantime our batteries
kept down the siege gun fire upon Lady
smith with shrapnel. At 9 o'clock there
seemed to be a lull as our reserves moved
up, but suddenly the engagement re
opened as the enemy on our right brought
further artillery to bear. Colonel Grim
wood, who, with the three advance bat
talions, had held the ridge for five hours,
suddenly fell back across the open upon
our guns.
"The Fifty-third Battery pluckily
pushed forward* to cover this withdrawal.
Several casualties occurred at this phase.
The Fifty-third Battery held on against
a cross-fire of rifles and quick-firing guns
until the infantry was clear. The team<*
of the two guns were damaged and the
battery eventually retired, made-up teams
being sent to extricate the guns. The
.cavalry, remaining unsupported, wero
forced to fall back also.
EUROPE WILL
NOT INTERFERE
State Department â  Fails to
Receive Word of Any
Action by Powers.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, "WASHINGTON. Oct.
30.â None of the American representatives stationed at European courts
has reported anything to the State Department indicating interference by
European powers in the Transvaal war. As a matter of fact, here the
officials indorse The Call-Herald's cablegram from Paris reporting that
the several powers likely to interfere are too busily engaged elsewhere to pay at
tenttoTi to South African affairs. Besides, the mobilization of British squadrons
is undoubtedly a warning by Great Britain of her preparedness to act, and is
accepted as su^h by the powers. Of course, it is to be expected that Russia,
France and Germany are watching the situation carefully, ready to take advan
tage of anything that may result beneficially to them; but none of them, so far
as the information of the State Department indicates, has made any move of a
hostile character to Great Britain, nor is it believed they are likely to take any
action which may precipitate a general war.
No matter if Great Britain should become involved in controversies with for
eign nations growing out of the South African situation, the United States will
undoubtedly maintain an attitude of strict neutrality, provided American inter
ests are not endangered. Such an attitude would undoubtedly be of great value
to Great Britain and more valuable to the powers opposing her.
BERLIN, Oct. 30.â Emperor William's farewell message to the British Royal
Dragoons, of which regiment he is honorary colonel, on their departure for
Africa, expressing his Majesty's hope that all might return "unscathed and well."
is taken as a proof of Germany's official neutrality. One of the evening papers,
referring to the dispatch, points out its high political significance and says it
is the best answer to "pan-Germanic leagues, Anglophobia and predictions of for
eign intervention, in which Germany is to play a leading part."
The Boersen Courier says: "The repeated foreign efforts to inveigle Germany
into interfering in a- question absolutely foreign to her national interests have
palpably the sole object of discrediting her policy. Germany declines the role
of acting manager in foreign interests detrimental to her own."
"Then began a general retirement on
Ladysmith. The guns which had been
covering the Devonshire Regiment stoutly
covered the final withdrawal. The enemy
did not press, but showed themselves in
their position in great numbers, only to
find that the Naval Brigade from the
Powerful had arrived. Two quick-firing
guns were at once placed in position, un
der cover of a redoubt, and in five rounds
they silenced the enemy's forty-pounder.
The troops were back in Ladysmith by 2
o'clock in the afternoon. The casualties
caused by the enemy's artillery were not
severe. The mountain battery on the left
reported it had suffered through a stam
pede of mules. Our artillery, cavalry, j
mounted infantry and volunteer cavalry |
behaved splendidly in difficult circum
stances. Dr. Jameson and Sir John Wil
loughby arrived to-day and were spec
tators of the action."
WHITE'S TROOPS YET IN
SERIOUS PREDICAMENT
LONDON, Oct. 31.â The engagement
yesterday at Ladysmith, which, despite
the rather heavy losses, must be regarded
rather as an extended reconnoissance or
skirmish than a battle, seems to make
little change in the actual position. It is
disappointing to the British public, as
again revealing tactical skill of an un
expectedly high order on the side of ihc
Boers. In addition to the possession of a
number of heavy guns, the transport of
which causes wonderment here, they
have available marvelous ability. Unless
commanded by skillful European officers,
It is hardly considered probable that Boer
farmers would have assumed a feigned
position, as they evidently did. in front
of the right column, with the intention of
retreating from it to their real line of de
fense and of inducing the British to at
tack over a lire-swept zone.
The special dispatches describing the
engagement again fail to confirm General
White's official account that the Boers
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
were pushed back several miles. "When
It is considered that the censorship is
very severe, the only conclusion that can
be arrived at is that the action was lÂ»x
--tremely inconclusive. The fighting began
with a frontal attack on the main Boat
position, which, however, was found
evacuated. The enemy having retired,
now made a change of front and de
veloped a heavy attack on Colonel Grim
wood's brigade.
To meet this, the British artillery,
which had been shelling the evacuated
position, also changed front.
Grimwood's brigade was promptly rein
forced, but soon was obliged to fall back
rapidly, with consequences which might
have been serious had not the Fifty-third
fieid battery pluckily covered the move
ment at considerable loss to itself.
It is quite certain that General White
failed to accomplish the object he in
tended, and the day's proceedings are an
instructive example of the difficulty of
operations when the enemy holds an ex
tended position by -which he is able to
make sudden and unexpected develop
ments and changes of front.
Sir Eedvers Buller cannot arrive at the
scene of the fighting until the end of this
week. In the meantime General White
will need all his resources to prever' 'he
Boers around Ladysmith linking their
forces.
The omission of all details likely to prive
a true idea of the position from General
White's dispatch may be due to his
reticence, but editing bj- war office offi
cials is likely to be again severely com
mented upon.
BULLER AT TABLE BAY.
LONDON, Oct. 31.â A dispatch from
Cape Town announces the arrival at
Table Bay of the Dunottar Castle late
last evening with General Sir Redvers
Buller and his staff, who are expected to
land this morning. They will meet with
a tremendous ovation in Cape Town.
It is reported from Pretoria that 200 of
the British wounded from Dundee have

It is high time that the honest voters

would not be used. It was understood that the small ammunition of the
ward heeler and political vagabond, the slanderous rumors, shameful per
sonalities and prying impertinence of political peeping Toms, was to be
discarded. To men that have the welfare and the future of the city at
heart there is at stake something deeper and better than this, and Demo
crats no less than Republicans pledged themselves to ask the suffrage
of the people for what either party represents in principle.
The Examiner, the organ of Mayor Phelan, has seen fit to disregard
the agreement and to invite a comparison of men and an emulation of
its own disreputable methods. It has opened its sewers of abuse and
asked healthy men to follow the scent in its nostrils. It has revealed in its
unclean self the instincts of the fishwife and asks its readers to follow
it in its prying trail upon the track of a man whose private life, to de
cent people, is still sacred, even if he is asking the suffrages of citizens
for high public place.
That the Examiner has found nothing of discredit in the private
life of Horace Davis is immaterial. The offense is in the indecent effort
of the Examiner to peep within the door of his home, follow him in
every movement of his life, trace him in the privacy of his family circle,
his place of business and his every walk of private life. And to accom
plish this the Examiner has employed a creature whose very name â Sam

MARCONI'S SYSTEM TRIED
WITH SUCCESS BY NAVY
NEW YORK, Oct. 80.â Over twenty
nine miles of the Atlantic Ocean,
over housetops, church spires and
towering office buildings, the Mar
coni electrical ripples successfully
carried and dropped messages be
tween two moving warships to-day. The
naval test at sea proved that within a
radius of twenty-one miles messages can
be transmitted by wireless telegraphy
with all the accuracy and precision of an
ordinary land line. This proved that hills,
high buildings and wires do not break
the force of the electrical waves and do
not interfere in the slightest degree with
the transmission of messages.
By prearrangements operations on
board the New York were conducted by
Bignor Marconi himself. One of his as
sistant* named Rradfleld operated the in
struments on the Massachusetts, while
Telegraph%r Bowden, another Marconi
expert, was stationed in the lighthouse
on the Highlands of Navesink. From the
Marconi transmitter on the lower floor of
the lighthouse annex the wire was carried
through the window, up the tall flagstaff
and up a sort of topmast, making its total
height above the ground about 150 feet.
Through the hatchways of the two war
ships the wires were extended to the
same height.

has been ascertained that # the Natal

the British movements. It seems that,
although the landings and departures of
the troops are effected by night and the
greatest secrecy Is maintained, yet the
enemy somehow gets information, de
Rainey â is an insult in the ears of reputable men, and degradation in the
hearing of decent women. This new commissioner of the Examiner
needs no new characterization. His blackguardism has been well
painted by bis new employer times without number. There is no offense
too vile for his commission. There is no condemnation that for him is too
severe.
According to the Examiner he has stained the public mind and
debauched private morality. His presence has been insult and his touch
contamination. He has been shunned in public and received in private
only by necessity. His morals indicate his methods, and he is the man
whom the Examiner has employed to track an honorable citizen, whose
life and name have been absolutely above reproach.
This creature's prying eyes have followed Horace Davis every
where. They have followed the victim of their indecency to see where

They have reported to their prurient master every detail of an honorable
existence. This is tke policy of the Mayor's organ. It is a policy repug
nant to every sense of propriety and will not be adopted by Republican
newspapers. But since the Examiner has indicated its desire and its
purpose to wallow in moral filth let it follow its policy to its logical con
clusion. Let it set its sewer-rat commissioner upon the track of Mayor
Phelan and have the prying eyes tell where and what he eats, when and
where he sleeps and works â and with whom.

"Follow us down at 1 p. m."
This message was the overture to the
telegraph testing programme, which in
cluded about seventy-five messages, all of
which had been prepared by the naval
board and were especially difficult. Every
five minutes during the course down the
river the New York telegraphed over the
constantly Increasing distance to the. Mas
i sachusetts and the battle ship replied to
the flagship without a break. All the mes
sages in the correspondence were caught
at Navesink and a careful record of them
was kept by Lieutenant Blish, the naval
| representative at the lighthouse. It was
: during the voyage down the river that
an official test for "Interference" was
made.
Without any warning to Marconi the
operator at Navesink. at the direction of
Lieutenant Blish. sent several messages
in quick succession to the flagship. The
result was a message from the Massachu
setts to the New York:
"Navesink has successfully interfered."
But a few minutes later the lighthouse
caught Marconi's explanation that one of
the ground wires on the New York had
not been secured properly, which allowed
the stray messages to break in on the
Conversation between the two warships.

C A. Murdock was selected to a
chairman, and in his introductory 1
marks said that he was like th<- shrimi
that the restaurant proprietor servi
fore the oysters. He was a shrimp, hi
stated, and" his sphere was merely to whel
the audience's appetites for the luscious
feast of reason that was to follow. He
had voted for Lincoln, he said, and had
never had cause to n-Kret his affiliation
with the Republican party and would
have nothing to be ashamed of when
next Tuesday he cast his ballot for Hon.
Horace Davis.
"No candidate fur Mayor," said the
speaker, "represents so many good quali
ties as the Republican candidate."
Mr. Murdock referred to Mr. Phelan's
remarks concerning the charter, and Baid
In many instances he had offered gratui
tous insults to the Republican |
especially after the charter was held to
be constitutional by the Supreme Court,
when he asserted through the columns of
i an evening paper that after a battle it
i was always n< cessary to look out for the
j dead and wounded. In the charter battle,
Phelan had said, the dead and wounded
I would be found in the Republican camp.
''That was a barefaced insult to every
Republican in the city," said Mr. Mur
dock. In reference to the charges made
: against_Mr. Davis for having held a con
sultatton with Martin Kelly, the speaker
said:
"Our enemies have been driven to such
straits that they have been forced to
make a mountain out of a molehill. They
have accredited him with improper mo-
I tives because he was willing to meet and
talk with a Republican who had fought
! a battle and lost. Horace Davis is a
conscientious and thorough Republican,
and he will not kick a man because^ he is
down. Nothing more need be said."
Colonel T. V. Eddy was the rirst of the
list of orators to address the audience.
He said that the Democratic cry that
this was a campaign of home rule was
the cheap claptrap of a demagogue.
"That is strong language," said the
speaker, "but unlike Mr. Phelan I do not
I intend to apologize for it. San Francisco
has always had home rnle. This is not
a campaign where the watchword is
home rule, but the question is. Who shall
rule? The claim of Mr. Phelan and
Franklin K. Lane that they are the
originators and virtual parents of the
chat-tor is the cheap claptrap of a pair of
demagogues."
Colonel Eddy spoke of the record of
Hon. Horace Davis as a citizen, as a
business man and a friend of labor. He
placed special stress on Mr. Davis' fight
against Chinese immigration. "And this
is the man that a political demagogue
called a traitor. He claimed afterward
that he was hasty; but 1 assert now that
when Mr. Phelan applied that word to
Mr. Davis he did it purposely and pre
meditatedly and he did it because he waa
angryâ angry because he was opposed for
the office by a man who had the moral
courage to stand fairly and squarely on
the platform of his party.
"Phelan coum not let his convention in
dorse the national Democratic platform
because he expected to gain a few Repub
lican votes. That is what I call false pre
tenses. If there was a law on the statutes
against false pretenses in politics we
could convict James D. Phelan to-night.
Republican votes elected him last year,
but this year false pretenses will not X".
Horace Davis was not born with a silver
spoon in his mouth. He gained every dol
lar of his fortune by his own labor and
energy. After he came to California he
did one of the noblest things an Ameri
can citizen can doâ and thai Is to rai.--'- ..
family. That is the kind of candidate we
present you. I need not draw compari
sons with the candidate on the other side.
(Laughter.)
"The people will teach Mr. Phelan on
the 7th of November that when he at
tempts to vilify for political reasons one
of our foremost citizens they will not
stand for it. When Horace Davis is
elected Mayor the people will be able to
get in to see him without a pass."
Colonel Eddy reviewed the entire Re
publican ticket, asserting that it was not
necessary to throw mud in order to elect
them. Cheers greeted the speaker at the
conclusion of his address, when he gave
way to Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker of New
! Jersey. Mr. Schoonmaker said:
"The Democrats claim that this Is a
! non-partisan campaign and for that rea-
I son they ask the Republicans to vote the .
Democratic ticket. Hon. Horace Davis 13
in every way the equal and in many par
ticulars' the superior of James D. Phelan.
The only hope of the Democrats is that
Republicans become non-partisan while
Democrats remain partisan. If the full
vote of the Republican party is given to
I Hon. Horace Davis he will be the next
Mayor of this city. The new Mayor of
San Francisco will have the appointment

services ao a member of Congress, president of
the Â«rd of Regents of the State Univer

REPUBLIC AN RALLY
IN THE MISSION
Th* Republicans of the Thirty-sixth
Assembly District held a rousing rally In
Twin Peaks Hall, Seventeenth and Noe

Mr. Davis was, of course, the star at
traction, and received a genuine ovation
when he arose to address the big gather
ing. He made a telling speech, in the
course of which he declared with con
vincing emphasis that he had made no
pledges or promises to any man, and
that if elected Mayor of San Francisco
he would go Into office entirely untram
meled and free to follow his own counsel
in administering the affairs of the city
and in making appointments. He urged
every Republican to get out and work for
the "success of the party at the. coming
election and to go to the polls and vote
for the entire ticket from top to bottom,
declaring that the nominees of the Re
publican party were all good men and
far superior to their opponents on the
Democratic ticket.
Mr. McKinlay made a rattling good
speech and aroused wild enthusiasm by
his sharply drawn contrasts between the

DAVIS RECEIVES
HEARTY WELCOME
In the eyclery ring on Page and Stan
yan streets the voters of the Thirty
eeventh District assembled last night to
listen to the Republican candidates and
show their interest in the campaign.
Horace Davis was the drawing card
here and the large hall was comfortably
filled. Mr. Davis told of his career and
his Intentions if elected. Not only did
he have the good will of his audience,
but their support was pledged him by
three rousing cheers.
Many candidates addressed the meeting
as well as others whose interest in the
campaign is due to a desire to secure the
election of the Republican ticket. Major
Kyle spoke of the good Mr. Davis has al
ready done for the city and what will be
accomplished under the new regime. Mr.
llathorn spoke for John Farnham. who
is at present confined at home. L. G.

tone and at no time was enthusiasm lack

and the usual campaign variations, these
men attested their interest In campaign
issues and pledged themselves with loud
acclaim to do all in their power for the
head of the ticket, Horace Davis, and
every other candidate on it.
The mention of the name of the Repub
lican candidate for Mayor was received

SITUATION IN NATAL
YET MOST SERIOUS
LONDON, Oct. Sl.â How serious the sit
uation In Natal Is considered hero Is
shown by the following summary of the
news which appears in this morning's
Daily TelfÃraph:
"Yesterday Sir George "White had an
other smart encounter with the burghers,
very similar to that at ReitfontHn, when

was from eighty to KiO killed and
wounded.
"Two untoward Incidents are men
tioned. The Royal Irish Fusileers and
Gloucesters were sent out at 11 o'clock
the previous night, accompanied by a
mountain battery, to clear the hills on
our left flank. The mules, frightened by
the night firing, stampeded with somÂ»
guns, which have not yet been recovered.
lÂ»ie two battalions had not returned up to
4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
"The Natal commander-ln-chief's report
was very brief, but he would not say the
return of the guns was expected without
tangible grounds for the statement, so
that he doubtless knows where they are
and will take measures to extricate them
If they have unfortunately got Into a dif
ficult place.
"Yesterday"s brush came about In this
way: General French was sent to attack
the position upon which on Sun'lay the
enemy had mounted several guna Ho

was of considerable strength, was at
tacked by the burghera. Thereupon the

statistical reports of the city, Ma

the formation of the municipal govern

and making our city comfortable for the
families living therein. Mayor Phelan has
never, with his princely income of over
srwi.ooo per year, huilt a factory, machine
shop or mill or in any manner employed
his capital for the benefit of the laboring
people. Major Allen spoke of the Bay

Mayor, and asked the voters to compare
the condition <>f that property to that of
the Horace Davis flour mills.

of the Forty-first Assembly District last
night at Tilton's Hall, Union street, near

"Two Important facts emerge from
General White's dispatch. First. Com
ma ml, mt General Joubert is at last on the
Bpot, and Sir George White believes that
these were his troops he attacked. Gen
eral Joubert had failed in his pursuit of
<;< neral Yule, and now he is committed to
investing Ladysmith, accepting attacks
such as that of yesterday whenever he
appears in force. The second fact is that
thÂ° Koers' guns ranged further than our
field guns, showing that they have been
ab!" to get up their heavy artillery, all of
which, according to Dr. Leyds, has now
been delivered by the makers. They were
alÂ«lo to bombard Ladysmith at a range of
more than 6000 yards.
"General White, however, has now got
some naval guns which have temporarily
silenced the Boers, and he hopes he will
be permanently able to dominate the en

At IO:S0 o'clock to-night word came

11 p. m., said that his condition was ap

HOW PHELAN BETRAYED
AND KNIFED M. C. HALEY
BEHIN 1^ *he scenes of the late Democratic convention M. C. Haley,
who had fairly won the nomination for County Clerk, was politically
knifed and robbed. The scorn of honest Democrats for the perpetrator
of the political crime is beginning to find expression. Thousands of Demo
crats who had intended to support Mayor Phelan for re-election may decide
to vote for Dr. Cleveland when they hear the true story of Haley's undoing,
which is told in the following open letter:
> SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15, 1899. (
Hon. James^T). Phelan, Mayor of San FranclÃeo:
Dear Sirâ l am in receipt of your note of October 12 replying to my letter \
. of the sth inst. relating to your ienomlnation as Mayor and referring also ,
to the matter of County Clerk.
Since the writing of my letter to you the nomination of Dennis Geary <
has lif-en made, or claimed to have been made, by your convention, and with '
my usual frankness in dealing with people I feel constrained to tell you how '
, that action on the part of your convention Is regarded by myself and nun- ',
dreds of Democrats whom I lave met since that unfortunate event.
It is no exaggeration to tate that the action of the convention with re- <
spect to the County Clerk's nomination has to a great extent discredited â¢
the otherwise fairly good work of the convention; that the nomination of '
, such a person as Dennis Geary over a gentleman like Mr. M. C. Haley and the ' (
manner of the nomination are regarded and spoken of as a political crime:
â  and that your part in the outrage perpetrated upon Mr. Haley in robbing ntm <
of a nomination fairly won on the floor of the convention and the injury (
done the party by the nomination of an unworthy person like Geary sheds a '
, new light upon your character and places you in a very unenviable position <
before the good citizenship of this community.
It is Inexplicable to me and to those with whom I have discussed this <
entire matter, men who are conversant with the farts, men who have foi- ' (
lowed you in all your battles, how you could have become a party to this ,
dastardly act. ,
It is Inexplicable how a man like Mr. M. C. Haley, after his splendid ser- Â«
viceÃ for years to the Democratic party and his splendid services to the peo- '
pie of this community as County CWk, having bef-n robbed of the County '
Clerkship in IS!>4 through the election boards of that year, manipulated by the (
base political elements which you publicly condemn and profess to be fight
ingâhow such a man could be twi^e set aside by conventions dominated <
wholly or in part by you and In the more recent one actually robbed of the
nomination through the manifest incompeteney, or, to speak more truth
fully, the unfairness of a chairman.
It cannot be understood how such a man as M. C. Haley, eulogized as he
has been by almost the entire presp of this city and repeatedly by yourself <
for his fidelity to the people and unswerving devotion to duty, could be, de- '
spite the expressed popular will, denied a place upon the Democratic ticket '
by creatures who owe their political existence to James D. Phelan. <
It cannot be explained away by any course of reasoning- why this gentle
man should have been a victim of a political trarle of Gavin McNab in one
convention and of political expediency in anotherâ the one recently held in
Native Sons' Hall and controlled by yourself. Thero are many uncharitable
enough to say that there are other and more potent reasons for the people
being the second time denied an opportunity to vote for M. C. Haley. There
are those who say that the Fame corrupting influences that had him robbed of
the election in 1594 have been successful in keeping him from a nomination in
your two conventions; and support is given to this idea by the fact that
some of the agents of these influences who. opposed Haley in 1594 are now
engaged in an active warfare in behalf of Dennis Geary and endeavoring to
promote his election.
It appears to the honest man. to the average mind, as absolutely indefen
sible that a man so widely and favorably known as M. C. Haley, a man who
made one of the best officials this city or State has ever had, should be
treated in this manner by men claiming to represent all that is good and
pure in public life. It certainly appears indefensible that a man with his
purity and nobility of character appealing strongly to anybody having any
admiration for what is good and pure in life, a man with a splendid public
record that should appeal to any man with honesty of purpose and sincere
desire to give the public good service, a man with a personal following and
popularity calculated to appeal to any leader of political forces possessing
any political sagacity or hone.-t desire to win for his party an important office;
and lastly, a man whose recent misfortune and severe affliction should recom
mend him to the kindly consideration of his more fortunate fellow-men and
appeal to the sympathies of any man claiming to have aught of the "milk of
human kindness" in his compositionâ it certainly appears indefensible that
such a man should be deprived of a nomination which his loyal friends and
the independent members of that convention had manfully won for him,
despite your power and wealth, and the place upon the Democratic ticket
given, through your manipulations of a serviceable chairman, to one like
Dennis Geary, an individual whom reputable men speak of as ungrateful and
dishonest; a man whose doubtful record in civil life has been but poorly ve
neered by a military record in the late war with Spain.
And what is more to be regretted in this matter. It is said that these
facts were placed before you by reputable and disinterested people prior to
his nomination by your convention. That this can be said, or even hinted at,
is certainly regrettable. I personally know that Maurice F. Loewensteln, a
member of your convention from the Fortieth Assembly District, a very
reputable young man, of sterling character, filling a responsible position in
one of our leading wholesale houses, went behind the stage that evening
to where you were directing Geary's fight for the nomination to again pro
test to you against his nomination and to again tell you of his unsavory
record. I also know that two of the candidates on the Democratic ticket
had the courage and the manliness to go behind the stage that evening to
see you and to protest against his nomination.
As a man up to that time interested in your election as Mayor of our
fair city, and up to that time believing in the integrity of your motives and
In your honesty of purpose, I did what I deemed to be my duty in the
premises.
I wrote you, warning you against allowing your political automatons to
make this mistake. I have since learned that I was not the only one to do
so. I was not the only one who wanted to save you from the criticism sure
to follow such an act.
I am also informed that Gavin McNab, your fldus achates, your "guide,
philosopher and fri<?nd." remarked that evening: "If the records of the two
men, M. C. Haley and Dennis Geary, could be placed before the convention
there would be little chance for Phelan's candidate, Dennis Geary."
En passant, it may be here remarked that notwithstanding this declara
tion of Gavin McNab. which he ma.v now deny, the creatures in that con
vention who look to that unselfish, patriotic and distinguished gentleman for
political guidance and advice voted for Dennis Geary.
M. C. Haley has passed from the political stage discouraged and disap
pointed, his faith in man shaken and his confidence in you destroyed. His is
a record of duty well performed and reward but poorly given. Haley, the
loyal friend, the good citizen, the honest man, the faithful public servant
whose candidacy for office was never of his own seeking, opposed in 1894 by
the cohorts of boodle and robbed of the election that year by the election
boards manipulated by political bosses, who opposed because they could not
control him and this year robbed of the nomination by the forces of James D.
Phelan. is driven, by "the powerful Influences dominating this community
into retirement while unworthy men are advanced. What a lesson to our
young men entering public life!
I am a Democrat and as your ticket comes nearer to representing the
principles of my party than does the Republican local ticket, for that reason
alone I feel disposed to "make a virtue of necessity" and vote the ticket
with the exception of Dennis Geary and one or two of your Supervisors,
whom I distrust.
As a citizen mindful of the responsibilities thereof I cannot vote for Den
nis Geary, and as I frankly stated in my letter to you prior to his nomina
tion, 1 will give some of my time toward explaining why I think he should
not be elected to any office of trust or responsibility.
The manner of his nomination makes an interesting addition to the
story. The public will be fully advised of "The True Story of Geary s
Nomination, and given "a peep behind the scenes" of a convention con
trolled by a reformer. Yours truly, MARTIN W. FLEMING.

fact remains that the sailor Is absolutely I

Bharkey showed In his prymnaslum work |
to-day that he is as near the ideal of
physical perfection as possible. There is j
noi an ounce of superfluous flesh on his
body. He is one mass of muscles, and, j
although apparently as hard as nails, is
nevertheless very active. His exercise to
doora to-day consisted of boxing bouta
With Armstrong and Dlxon. bae-punching
and handball and an eight-mile spin on
ad. Although the exercise he took
was of a vigorous and trying nature,
Sharkey did not show distress at any
period of his work. He is perfectly trained
and says that he never felt better pre- ;
pared for a fight than he does at present.
Many persons have been of the opinion .
that Sharkey made a mistake in extend-
Ing the time of battle one week, so as
to give Jeffries an apportunity to pot his
Injured arm into proper shape again; t.ut
the sailor said this idea was an erroneous
one.
"I need the extra week, I gaiess, just |
as much as Jeffries, so my friends need
have no concern about my being over
trained, T am just in the right condition,
and that's all there is to it. '
Be that as it may, "Tommy" Ryan aud |
"Billy" Delaney, under whose supervision
Jeffries has been training at Allenhurst.
N. J., said to-day that they considered
the extra week's time most beneficial to
Jeffries. He looked much better to-day
than he did a week ago, and Ryan and i
Delaney both said that had Jeffries
fought last Friday night he would have
been unable to do himself justice.
The California^ himself believes that
the extension of time was a point in his
favor. He certainly looked well to-day
during his exercise work, which was of a
trying character. He punched the ball
had boxing bouta with Ryan and "Jack"
Jeffries, wrestled with Roeber and played
handball. At the conclusion of his day's
work lie looked in fine shape and showed
no indications of the tired feeling which
is so characteristic of the untrained ath
lete.
Jeffries gave no expression of opinion
as to how long the fight would last. He
said his style of fighting would bo gov.
erned entirely by that employed by Snar
key.
"It may be a short fight and it may
be a long one, but when it is all over I'll
collect the winner's share of the purse."

SUCCESSFUL
DEBUT OF A
CRACK RIDER
Tommy Burns Was on Mag
dalenas, Receiving an Ova
tion â Upsets at Oakland.
Tommy Burns, the Intrepid Middle
Western rider, made his California debut
at Oakland track yesterday, and scored a
signal success. He stayed away from the
Jockey room and mud-bespattered colors
until the last race, when he made the weight
on flying Magdalenas. The event was a
five furlong selling handicap and the mare
opened a 6 to 5 choice, receding later to
11 to 5. Burns comes here with a reputa
tion as a wonder at getting away from
the barrier, and he certainly is good.
Swinging the mare around at about the
fourth breakaway, he was away in front,
leading at one time by a dozen lengths.
The chestnut filly backed up somewhat,
but at the wire he held Novla safe, winning
by a length. Burns was accorded a hearty
welcome as he issued from the paddock
and received quite an ovation from the
assembled crowd as he returned to the
stand on the back of the winner.
As usual, the muddy footing proved
confusing, and several well-backed horses
ran disappointingly. Still, favorites about
held their own by capturing three of the
six events decided.
By long odds the best contest of the
afternoon was the six and a half furlong
sprint for two-year-olds, with Southern
Girl, Bathos, Princess Zeika, Alee and
The Scot as starters. Princess Zeika,
after opening up at 6 to 1 and closing at
10 and 11, turned up winner after a stub
born and desperate duel the last furlong
with Bathos. Southern Girl was always
a prominent favorite in the betting, and
though making a great showing was un
able to concede the weight. Picking up
110 pounds with Bathos, the pair chased
off in the lead, with Ward, on the Prin
cess, trailing behind in fourth position.
As the stretch turn was rounded Ward
made his move, pulling up with the lead
ers. Over a furlong from home the favor
ite was tiring and Bathos looked groggy.
The latter responded gamely, however,
when Jones called on him again, and in
a very close and exciting finish lost by a
scant head. Southern Girl was a lair
third. Alee, after acting badly at the
post, showed to excellent advantage and
will undoubtedly be heard from later on.
Miss Madeline, 0 to 10 favorite in the
betting, took the opening five-furlong spin
from lllilouette, after leading all the way.
Tionza ran a fatr third.
"Butch" Fisher's gelding. Plan, was
quite the thing in the betting on the
seven furlong selling run. In a collision
Just as the barrier was released he had
none the best of it, losing three or four
lengths, and was beaten handily by Mont
allade, the third choice. Jack Martin
rode the winner and made a good Job of
It Don Luis ran an indifferent third.
T. Walsh straddled Castake, favorite
for the mile and a sixteenth free handi
cap, and his saddle work was capital.
He waited on Mamie G until well into
the stretch, where he began sawing wood
and moved to the front. At the last
Reolia came with a rush, compelling
Walsh to ride his mount out to win by
a neck. After opening at 6 to 5 and re
ceding to 9 to 5 Mamie G, the original
favorite, finished third.
The Baldwin stable furnished the sen
sational one in the mile run, for which
Recreation went to the post an 11 to 10
choice. The brown filly dropped in with
Jack Martin and 86 pounds in the saddle,
and sifted along out in the lead. The
favorite made a bid for it at the paddock,
but her legs wobbled and the outsider
crossed the line winner by a head. Show
honors fell to Rainier.
Track Notes.
In the bumping match a3 the barrier
was released in the second event Lodestar
fared badly, losing four or five lengths
to begin with. Songer then made no ef
fort to get up to the leaders. For his
Btrange conduct he was ordered suspended
by the judges for the balance of the week.
In explaining the ride Songer said sev
eral owners had complained about his
unnecessary punishment of their horse 3
and he supposed he was doing right in
not trying to use Lodestar when appar
ently the horse had no chance.
On Thursday morning, at 10 o'clock, at
the corner or Fifteenth and Valencia
streets, 100 head of horses, including many
thoroughbreds and trotters, the property
of Dan McCarty, will be sold at auction.
The stock is now on the premises and
may be inspected by any one Interested.

FILIPINO LADRONES
AND CHINESE FIGHT
WASHINGTON, Oct. "o.â Recent mall
advices from Manila show the existence
of much uneasiness among the Chinese
residents of the city and Ruburbs due to
is conflicts between the na
tive Filipinos and the Chinese. One of
the sources of friction appears to be the
displacement of Chinese laborers for Fil
ipinos <>n a considerable amount of Gov
ernment work. The transportation quar
termaster general discharged 200 Chinese
and ; places with Filipinos, most
of them Macabebes, brought from the
Interior. The discharge of the Chinese Is
paid to bo due to their unwillingness to
be shifted to various points where the
emergency v.'>rk was to be done. In the
suburbs of Blnondo a party of Chinese
was attacked by native Ladrones and a

FRIARS BANISHED FROM
THE ISLAND OF GUAM
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â The Navy De
partment has received a report from Cap
tain Leary. the naval Governor of the
island of Guam, in the Ladrones, which
has excited a good deal of Interest among
the officials to whom it has been exhib
ited. The President himself has read the
report, his interest being particularly at
tracted by the disclosure of the fact that
the first Americaji Governor of the isl
and has been obliged to adopt heroic
measures to insure a proper administra
tion of affairs there Captain Leary soon
learned that his authority as Governor
was being subverted and every one of
the measures of reform which he pro
posed was being defeated by the hostile
Influence of the friars. They resisted
every decree, no matter of what charac
ter, from a spirit of intense conserva
tism, and a belief that any disturbance
of the order of things which had gov
erned the Island for so many years would
cause them to lose their hold upon the
natives.
After exhausting all other means to
overcome this influence. Captain Leary
reports that he was obliged to notify a
half dozen of the friars that they might
have free transportation away from
Guam and he should expect them to avail
themselves of the offer. That left but
one friar on the island, and he was a
man whose character ami reputation were
such as to convince Captain Leary of his
fitness to remain.
QUANTITY OF STORES
TO BE SENT TO GUAM
Now the Navy Department Is not un
mindful of the needs and necessities of
the Island of Guam Is evidenced by the
fact that yesterday noon bids were
opened at the United States Navy Pay
Office In this city fur a large quantity of
ptores for Captain Leary. The supplies
will be shipped to Guam by the united
States steamship Solace, which is now at
Mare Island rapidly preparing for sea
and getting stores aboard. Her destina
tion la Manila, but sÂ»he will drop in at
Guam en route. Twenty thousand feet
of wroughtlron pipe, thousands of fe< t
of castiron pipe, together with all kinds
of fittingu and connections, pig lead, pipe
cutters, wrenches, drills and a large quan
tity of sewer pipe are among the arti
cles purchased. The navy paymaster
bought a complete sawmill outfit, con
sisting of boiler, engine and carriage and
no doubt this will prove quite a novelty
to the natives when in working order.
The Solace Ik scheduled to leave about the
Bth of November.
Last week the navy paymaster deliv- i
ered to A. S. Carman a contract for about ;
$28,000 for the supply of nearly 500,000 feet
f.f lumber, Including a quantity of spars,
the same to be delivered at the navy sta- :

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1899.
HERNANDEZ WILL GIVE
CASTRO MUCH TROURLE
Counter Revolution Likely to Involve Vene
zuela In Internecine Strife for Some
Time to Come.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. -The official announcement of the de
parture of Hernandez with 2000 men from Caracas, presumably for the purpose of inaugurating a counter revolution
against the de facto Government of Venezuela, was received at the State Department to-day. Minister Loomis, dip
lomatic representative of the United States to Venezuela, telegraphed to the State Department this afternoon that
Hernandez left Caracas at midnight last night. He significantly added that next to De Castro General Hernandez
was the strongest leader in Venezuela, so that it is probable that unless an agreement should be reached bloodshed
will continue in the little republic.
It is presumed by officials that the departure of Hernandez Is due to his failure to reach an arrangement with De Cas
tro whereby he should be elected as President. It will be recalled that Hernandez was a candidate for election when An
drade was declared President. He claimed that Andrade's election was the result of fraud. He was arrested in Caracas
with some of his followers and thrown into prison, from which he was liberated by De Castro.
The continuance of revolutionary conditions in Venezuela Is very disappointing to the officials, especially in view of
the lack of ships for service in South and Central American waters. It has been intended to order the Detroit to pro
ceed to Cartagena or Colon to take care of American interests In Colombia, threatened by the insurrection prevailing
there, but this is now Impossible.
The Marblehead will proceed to Panama and the Scorpion early next month to Colon with- members of the Isthmian
second Regiment started from Fort Ni
agara for San Francisco en route for Ma
nila to-day. In the absence of Colonel
Thompson, who is in the Philippines.
Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Beacom was in
command.
PHILIPPNE COMMISSION
BEGINS ITS SITTING
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â The Philippine
Commission held its first meeting at the
quarters selected for it in the Arlington
to-day. Professor Schurmann, for whose ;
arrival the other members have been
waiting, reached Washington this morn
i ing and paid an early call at the State
Department, after which he went to tha
I commission's rooms, where Admiral Dew
ey and Colonel Denby were waiting.
Professor Worcester was the last to ar
rive and the commission sat down to
j business soon after 10 o'clock. It was
â  announced before the meeting that all
1 the sessions would be secret and that none
j of the deliberations would be made pub
lic until the commission had finished its
: labors. Colonel Denby said no programme
! had been arranged and It was impossible
to say even what general course would I
| be followed until after the commissioners ]
1 had discussed the matter.
The commission reorganized its clerical
! force and roughly blocked out the form i
!of its report. There is a mass of material j
i on hand and a good part of the report is i
already written. It was said after the '
meeting that it was too soon to say how
long the work in hand would take, but
the suggestion was made by one member
that it would be a matter of some weeks, j
' but not much longer. The commission â 
will meet daily from 10 until 1 o'clock, [
â  leaving the afternoons and evenings for
Individual work.

SEEK TO CONTROL
SOUTHERN OIL FIELDS
Various Large Investments Recently
Made by Capitalists From San
Francisco.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30.â San Francisco
capital, if Investments that are now in
contemplation are realized, will dominate
the local oil Held as well as the streetcar
system. During the past week northern
capital has purchased the fourteen wella
belonging to the Yukon Oil Company. The
wells purchased are among the steady
producers and have a registered capacity
of 5000 barrels a month. It is reported
that the same company is negotiating
with the Rex Oil Company for its sixty
wells. Producers are strongly inclined to
believe that an effort is being made to
corner the Loa Angeles field. This would
be no impossible task, and once accom
plished would make possible almost any
price on local oil and a profit almost
fabulous.
The Hearst estate has purchased the
controlling interest in the Canfield and
Chanslor Company of Coalinga. The price
paid for thirty-live shares in the company
is said to be $140,000.
The Santa Fe Company has a flowing
well at Fullerton steadily producing 180
barrels of oil dally. The Loft us gusher
In this field is flowing about 160 barrels.
There is a bear tendency In the market
now, oil being sold during the week as low
as Jl 05 a barrel.
NEW YORK FERRY-BOAT
SUNK IN COLLISION
Disaster in Which Several Passen=
gers Are Believed to Have
Lost Their Lives.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.â The Pennsyl
i vania ferry boat Chicago, plying between
| Jersey City and New York, was cut in
i two by the steamer City of Augusta tf
j the Savannah Steamship line at 12:35 this
(Tuesday) morning on the New York side
! of North River. She went down in seven
|or eight minutes. There were between
I thirty and forty persons aboard, four be
ing women. It is supposed several were
drowned, though there Is no positive proof
; of this assertion.
In spite of the severity of the accident
there was no panic Most of the pas
sengers were on the upper deck and only
a half dozen persons were on the lower
deck. Nearly all of them managed to
obtain life preservers. Some who could
not obtain them, about a half dozen in
> number, swam ashore.
The five or six persons who started
j from the lower deck assisted each other
!in getting ashore. One or two were wlth
| out life preservers, but they all aided
one another and succeeded in getting to
j the pier safely.
There was considerable shouting for
I help, those on the boat calling for small
boats to come to their assistance. No
i small boats were launched, however,
! probably owing to the brief time which
i elapsed between the collision and the
. sinking.
The Old Dominion liner was evidently

LAND CASES DECIDED
BY SUPREME COURT
Three Opinions Adjudicating Con

Arizona.
"WASHINGTON. Oct. 30.â 1n the United
States Supreme Court to-day an opinion
was handed down by Justice Brown in the
case of the appeal of the United States
from the decision of the Court of Private
Land Claims in the case of the Cuya
munga land grant, situated in Santa Fe
County, New Mexico. The land court de
cided that the title to the grant was
properly held by Maria de la Paz de Con
way arid associates, and declined to ex
cept in the decree lands covered by pat
ents issued to Pueblo Indians covering a
large portion of the grant. The decision
rendered to-day holds that these lands
should have been excepted, and accord
ingly reversed the opinion of the lower
The court affirmed the opinion of the
Private Land Court in the case of the
claim of the town of Real de Dolores del
Oro to land located In New Mexico, af
firming the decision of the Court of Pri
vate Land Claims. In this case the Su
preme Court found that the land in con
troversy was included in the Ortez mine
grant and that the appellants were with
out legal redress.
The court, in an opinion by Justice
Gray, reversed the decision of the Su
f>reme Court of Arizona in a case involv
ng title to the Sonvlto grant in Arizona.
This title was at issue between Santiago
\insa and the New Mexican and Arizona
Railroad Company. The reversal was
based on the ruling of the court below
that the case could not be tried in the
ordinary courts.
Factory Girls Strike.
EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio. Oct. 30.-
Seven hundred girls employed In the bis

partments of nearly every pottery In the
city struck this morning for higher
wages.
coming up the river at the time of the
accident, while the ferry boat Chicago
was headed straight across from the New
Jersey shore for the New York slip. The
City of Augusta stopped after the acci
dent, but apparently no boats were
launched, and in the brief space of time
which elapsed nothing was done to assist
those In the water.
Estimates made by the persons who
succeeded in escaping differ very widely,
some thinking it possible that at least a
score of persons were drawn into the
whirling vortex as the ferry boat sank.
The steamboat Squad, a few minutes be
fore 2 o'clock, found a body which, it is
supposed, is that of one of the passengers
on the ferry boat, drowned as the result
of the collision.
H. W. Bible of this city jumped over
board with a life-preserver. He saw four
women struggling in the water near him,
but was unable to help them. He was
picked up by a lifeboat and taken ashore.
Searchlights are being used in the work
of rescue. A number of tugs and small
boats have been secured. Everything is
being done under the circumstances to
pick up persons from the water. One
boat brought In six men, two women and
a child. Captain Dunham, who command
eod the ferry-boat, says that he is of the
opinion that no lives were lost unless
perhaps that of one of his firemen, J.
Broom.
Seven wagons and teams were lost. One
of these belonged to the American Ex
press Company and had $8000 worth of sil
ver on it.
CUBAN FARMERS
WANT A TARIFF
Ask That a Duty Be
Placed on Corn.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Oct. 30.â Governor General
Brooke has received a petition signed by
a number of Cuban .farmers urging pro
tection against American corn. The
farmers say they have no money to buy
machinery, but have to plant by hand,
and to carry their produce on their backs
to where they obtain little for it, owing
to the fact that there is scarcely any
duty on foreign grain. The petition goes
on to say that this condition greatly han
dicaps the Cubans in their attempts to
recover a degree of their former pros
perity. â¢ i â â â â -.
Incidentally the farmers protest against
the protective duties on oil, alleging that
these are in force solely to protect one
American refinery, whereas a protective
I duty on corn "would mean the welfare
of thousands of small farmers, whose
only source of revenue is what they make
by growing corn."
Senor Domingo Mendez Capote, Secre
tary of the Government in General
Brookes' advisory Cabinet, when waited
upon by a committee of Veterans of In
dependence, who asked him to explain
the dismissal of General Ruiz Riviera
from the Civil Governorship of Havana,
implying that there had been some dis
tinction made between the two classes of
revolutionists, replied that the dismissal

At Abreu, province of Santa Clara, a
deputation of citizens called upon the
Mayor and asked him to issue an order

leave town immediately, as he had
spoken against the Cubans. The Mayor
told Ceballos he had better go in order
to avoid trouble, and he complied with
the suggestion.
One Borjes, a Cuban, was accused in

the Cubans. He was ordered to leave
town and did so. This man fought for
the Spaniards during the war.

IN UNION IS STRENGTH.
GOVERNOR - â  .'.etermined to serve the
â¢ c Railroad and Dan Burns to
the utmost in': r, and it may therefore
ttled thai upon one pre
tens< ' iture
living the Kentucky
r chance to ck-ct its Mexicai
rite.
being the condition of affairs, it behooves
in the last Letu Mature up
the party and the welfare of Cali
ia by defeating the schemes of Herrin and Burns
ut preparing a plan of campaign
that is to come. In preparing that
rbial truth to be remembered,
"In union then - :ii."
At th< ; the Legislature it was impos
position to Burns and the
â¢sequence the railroad schemers
were baffled but not beaten. The succession to the
â¢orship is still open. There is still a chance for
the Kentucky corporation to disgrace California, by
uring the election of Burns. It is for that reason
tlie extra se^- be called and the taxpayers
burdened with the cost of defraying it= expenses.
on the side of honest politics and hon
est men agreed upon some candidate their victory
would have been complete. California's vacant seat
in the Senate would be filled by a Republican worthy
of the honor and the people would be spared the ex
pense of the c in.
It is not t< â¢ to expect the friends of Grant,
Bulla, Barnes, Scr.tt. Bard, Estee, Felton and the
other Rej lib 1 'dates at the last session to
profit by the I the p md show a greater
wisdom ii It will be a part of the tactics of
the railroad to keep them divided. It is their duty
to unite.
Arrangements should be made at once for some
form of conference among the supporters of the va
rious candidates who were opposed by the railroad
last winter. At that conference the chief object
should be to agree upon some candidate and give
him the united suj . 11. Should such ta
be adopted the defeat of the railroad schemer* would
be assured. If it be not adopted the chances for the
eventual triumph < B are by no means des
perate.
The Call has no candidate to urge upon the stanch
and true Republican* who Â»o honorably and <â â¢'
fastly upheld the credit of the party and the State last
winter. It a<i they unite against the
common foe. If none entlemen voted for
last winter be satisfactory to all, then let some other
man be chosen. There is Mirely some Republican in
California for whom all cood Republicans in the
Legislature will be willing to vote. Let him be
en. â 
The issue is not a question of men but of methods.
It is to drop the old divisions and organize for vic
tory. In union there is strength.
Uncle Sam will probably discover some of these
days that his c-Mer cu^in across the seas does not
permit any renewal of old-time friendship to
blind him to any advantage that may be within
reach. It appears now that under the terms of the
modus vivendi which temporarily fixe; the Alaskan
boundary Canada has received fifteen mile* of very
valuable territory to which she never pretended own
ership.
Tt is not often that the refinement of selfish sar
casm enters into the language of diplomacy as it did
in a recent assurance given by the United States and
nd to China. The Celestial authorities were
assured that if Ru â ia, Germany and France insist
upon partitioning the Chinese empire they will not
Iâ¢â¢ permitted to keep any commercial advantage
away from the newly united cousins.
There is somethiluj deeply pathetic, in tho elaborate
explanation which tfte Spanish authorities have made
of their defeat at Santiago. The story from their
pcint of view could have been summarized in a sen
tence â they were whipped because they didn't win.
THE organs of Mr. Phelan evidently believe that the campaign has reached the stage
at which, from their standpoint, there are votes in personalities. Mr. Phelan began
in that way and made an apology for it which did not apologize.
As far as the Republicans are concerned they welcome a campaign upon the
personality of Horace Davis. He was the architect of his own fortune. As a father, his
children bear his name and are an honor to it. As a student and scholar he stands with the
learned. As a public character he ranks 'with that patient class of State builders who labor
and wait. His word has never been violated. He remembers the path in which he walked
through toil and stress, and looks back over its long stretch with sympathy and brother
hood to those men whose feet arc in it now.
In all these respects the Republican party challenges comparison -with Mr. Phelan.
His organ is provoking that comparison and may not have to wait long to get it.
The course pursued by Mr. Phelan and his partisans is exactly that of the corrupt
and corrupting politicians who by mud-throwing have sought to drive clean and decent
men out of public life in order that the muck brigade might monopolize its opportunities.
As far as The Call is concerned it served notice on its party last summer that its
municipal ticket must be above suspicion or we would not support it. Our word would
have been kept with fidelity. We believed then as we know now- that the Republican
party of this city had in it the best of material for the officiary of a city government under
the new charter or any charter, and we desired to see that material chosen. The result jus
tified this paper. The candidates are an honor to the party. The leader of the ticket is rep
resentative of its character. There is no excuse for beginning personal abuse, except the
excuse of desperation and indecency. We do not propose, however, that our ticket shall
be brained by stones thrown from the glass house of Mr. Phelan's Democratic party.
FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
THE session of Congress will soon begin. There
will be many things requiring its attention.
New subjects of legislation, of the gravest
character, have appeared. They involve questions of
government and of revenue. A great army and a
great navy have to be cared for. Exhausting mili
tary operations at a costly distance from their base
have to be carried on. We are in the midst of un
tried policies and of new problems. Their burden
only adds to the dangers to be anticipated from any
weak places in our system.
Our financial legislation and policy are as weak
now as when their condition so keenly alarmed the
country in 1896. The burden upon them then was
only that of carrying such conditions as might arise
out of policies long before the people, and that bur
den they were believed incapable of supporting. Our
financial system was then believed by millions to be
a disease that threatened, at all times, the public
credit. The Republican party and the gold Democ
racy boldly declared that the disease must be eradi
cated. The Bryan Democracy as stoutly insisted that
it must be used as a foundation.
The country has waited. The Republican party f>
the close of the last Congress had no power to cure
our financial disease. It had no majority in the Sen
ate. It could act no further than to declare its pur
pose to act when the people gave it power. The peo
ple have responded. They have given it a working
rity in both houses. They have been so earnest
in this grant of power that not a single straight Dem
ocratic Senator is left from the North, and seven
Senatorial seats have been tilled by Republicans from
the South. Never in our political history have the
people shown such a determined devotion to have an
issue settled, and settled rightly, as they have shown
in regard to this issue.
Those who don't want to act. who say they want
i to let well enough alone, in effect mean that they
; want to let bad enough alone. The prosperity to
, which they point is not because of our bad financial
. system, but in spite of it.j Were that system sane
and sound there would be less feverish apprehension
attending present business conditions. The prosper
ity we have would promise longer continuance, and
its benefits would be even more general than they
are. if the foundation were secure. They are not
well informed advisers who counsel the Republican
party to sleep on its financial promise?. Public at
tention cannot be altogether withdrawn from those
promises nor from that i^sue. The position of Mr.
Bryan is wrong: it may be called fanaticism, scien
tifically unsound and all that. But it has one single
virtue, and that a very useful one in politics. It is
an affirmative position. It cannot be turned by a
negation. The Republican party has opposed it, up
to the point of reversing the majority in the Senate,
by a positive policy. Its convictions in favor of
financial reform have been so plainly stated that sound
money Democrats and Republicans everywhere com
bined in support of Republican candidates. Tb<*
threatening fusions of last year were in every State
faced, fought and overthrown by that sound money
force.
Therefore it is that every obligation of honor and
policy requires that the Republican party proceed,
decently and in order, of its own will and by the
exercise of the power given to it by the people, to
enact the reform legislation it has promised. Against
this no good argument can be made from a Repub
lican standpoint. The forces behind Mr. Bryan will
be delighted with Republican failure to act. They
will take such failure as an admission that the sound
money men of the country are afraid to use their
power to redeem their promises.
There are roads and roads to such reforms. One
road is by letting the advocates of financial heresy
and confusion take power and use it to enact their
scheme= into law. This is burning the building to
get rid of the rats.
The Republican plan should be to destroy the rats
so that they will not die in the house, and save the
building.
Moreover, it is easy now to put reform legislation
in action. The country is strong in trade. Though
there is still a treasury deficit, the consuming ca
pacity of the people will respond readily to a rate
of taxation that will turn it into a surplus. What
the sound money men proposed in iÃq6 can now be
carried out and not an adverse ripple will appear on
the swelling sea of commerce. Such legislation will
make easier the reaction which always follows these
periods of high activity. Without such legislation
that reaction may become a cyclone. With it there
will be only a in the trade winds and wreck
and ruin will be averted.
Mayor Phelan, who can be voluble enough on
occasion, k strangely silent now that his morning
organ and the afternoon monkey that goes with it
are attempting to slur the character of his opponent.
Does the Mayor wish to be understood as sponsor for
their tat ti ? It seem- to.
Now that the Hoers and British have been sparring
in the preliminaries for several weeks, the event of
the evening, as Master of Ceremonies Billy Jordan
would call it, will be put on Friday night, when Jef
fries and Sharkey contest for the fistic supremacy of
the world.
South American republics must be short of ammu
nition or too busy with their several domestic quar
rel? to so to war with each other. They have de
cided to arbitrate any trouble that may arise among
themselves.
THE 6A^ FRANCISCO CALL, T ITESPAY, OCTOBER 31, 1899.
A PERSONAL CAMPAIGN.
DURING the next seven days the thoughtful, in
telligent voters of San Francisco will have to
make up their minds how they will vote at the
coining election. Fortunately there is every
assurance that very few will ignore or seek to evade
the issue. The interest shown at the primaries, the
large registration, and the full attendance which has
been noted at the principal mass meetings of the
campaign are evidences that at last the business men
and the taxpayers of the city are awake to the import
ance of municipal contests, and purpose to. leave the
results no longer to the determination of bosses and
their gangs.
In the last two elections a considerable number of
Republicans voted for Mayor Phelan and his political
success was due to the support he received in that
way. At that time he was a man of promises and
made his campaigns adroitly. Now he is an official
with a record, and past success has turned his head,
for he is not as adroit as he was when with such
cleverness he played the double bill of a Democrat and
a Non-Partisan. His speeches in this campaign have
shown the extent to which the spirit of bossism has
developed in him. It was revealed in his denunciation
of Horace Davis as "a traitor" and in his declaration
that if elected Mayor, when the time comes for him to
form the bi-partisan commissions provided for by the
charter, "no traitors to the charter, no Republicans
who have dared to force national affairs into our local
campaign, will be given commissions."
The issue is between a ticket virtually dictated by
this would-be boss and headed by him and a ticket
nominated by the Republicans of the city which has
won and merited the commendation of being the best
ticket ever nominated in a municipal contest in San
Francisco. What Republican can give to his friends,
or to himself, any valid reason for voting against
Horace Davi? and his colleagues? Why should any
independent citizen desiring the welfare of the com
munity turn away from a candidate of such distin
guished public service and such eminence in private
business for the purpose of supporting a man who.
having been twice tried in the office of Mayor, has
achieved nothing for the city except such measures
as were almost forced upon him by the Republican
majority of the present Board of Supervisors?
In his efforts to win for a third time by the old
tactirs Phelan has repeatedly declared that national
issues are not in any way involved in the contest. Ii
it certain, however, that if elected he and his party
will hail it as a Democratic victory, and he will make
use of it as a means of obtaining further political
advancement. It will be a Democratic victory if
Phelan win, because it will be a failure on the part of
Republicans to remain true to their own standard and
to uphold their right to administer the affairs of the
city under the new charter.
rROM the Portland Oregonian comes .a curious
argument against legislation in the direction of
upbuilding an American merchant marine. It
says: "Several San Francisco shipowners were for
tunate enough to have steamers available for the
transport service, and the charter rates paid for these
steamers by the Government have invariably been
higher than the rate's paid foreign steamers for the
same service. As the people as a whole will foot the
bills for these transports, it will be seen that the
burden would rest more lightly on them had every
ship in the service been under a foreign flag."
By reason of the lack of legislation to encourage
shipbuilding at home and to put our merchant
marine on an equal footing with that of other nation*,
the United States, when the Spanish war broke out.
found it impossible to obtain enough American
steamers to transport troops to the seat of war, and
had to charter foreign ships. In that fact the Ore
gonian finds a reason for not building American ships
in the future. To most Americans the fact will be a
reason why we should build them. It is not of
advantage to any nation to be dependent upon for
eigners in time of war, even though such dependence
might be a little cheaper than independence.
But^he Orcgonian is wrong in arguing that reliance
upon foreign vessels is economical. Had the United
States possessed a merchant marine in any way
adequate to its commercial rank, it would not have
had to pay such high prices as it did for transports.
Great Britain has been liberal in granting subsidies
to shipping, and as a result of her wisdom she was
able as soon as President Kruger issued his ultimatum,
which meant war, to at once obtain the services of
eighty first-class steamers to transport troops to
South Africa. She obtained them much cheaper than
she could have done had she not built up her shipping
industry in time of peace.
The Oregonian. however, need not go back to the
time of the war with Spain nor to foreign countries to
get object lessons as to the importance of upbuilding
our commercial marine. Oregon has many tons of
wheat and other merchantable products to sell. She
has ports that open out upon the Pacific on the further
shores of which are markets for all that Oregon can
produce. The State has, moreover, the materials for
building ships and men who know how to build them.
Why, then, should not the produce of Oregon be
carried to market across the seas in ships built in
Oregon? Why leave the ocean-carrying trade to the
foreigners? Why pay him tribute on every pound of
thi produce of Oregon that he carries? Why leave
Oregon shipyards idle and Oregon workingmen
unemployed? Does the Oregonian really believe the
foreigner is cheaper when all things are taken into
consideration?

OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
A CERTAINTY AMONG MANY RUMORS
OOM PAULâ WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENS, THEY'LL NEVER HOBSONIZE ME!
WILL BE A GREAT HELP
TO WORKING BOYS
Brother Florinus of Sacred Heart College Saus He
Will Recommend The Call's "Home Study
Circle" to the Attention of His Pupils.
The Editor of the Call: The educational
plan inaugurated in the columns of The Call
meets with my hearty indorsement and commenda
tion. I recognize the fact that the plan will
be of incalculable benefit to all who will take
it up; but more especially will it be a grand
help to working boys who have not the opportu
nities of acquiring an education. I candidly
believe if they will take an interest in the
project that it will benefit them in more ways
than one. It will serve to keep them at home
in the evenings and instil in their minds some
of the best thought of our most distinguished
educators.
I shall take great pleasure in recommending
the attention of the pupils under my charge to
this exceedingly worthy proposition, and con
gratulate The Call on its commendable enter
prise. Respectfully,
President of Sacred Heart College.

HAWAII CLASSED
AS A CONQUEST
Customs Put in Charge
of the Military.
Bpecln.l Dispatch to The Otll.
PORT TOWXSEND, Oct. 30.â According j
to advices brought from Honolulu by the j
Steamship Elihu Thompson, arriving here *
this evening, residents of the Hawaiian
Islands are in a state of great excitement
over the receipt of a letter from As- ;
sistant Secretary of the Treasury Frank ,
Vanderlip, stating that the customs de
partment of the Hawaiian Islands was
under the control of the War Department.
The letter was in reply to an application !
for a position In the customs service by
a resident of Honolulu.
It is claimed this Is the first intimation
the authorities on the island have received
that the customs department has been
transferred to the military, and \vhen
shown the letter Harold M. SewaJl, special
agent of the United States Government,
and other Government representatives
expressed a belief that Secretary Van
cierlip had got the Hawaiian Islands con
fused with Porto Kico, Cuba and other
conquered territory.
Major Mills, in command of two bat
talions of the Sixth Artillery, stationed
at Honolulu, disclaims any knowledge of
the now regime.
In relation to the foregoing a rumor is
In circulation in Honolulu that the present
officers of the local government will be
removed by President McKtnley and new
appointments made immediately, but both
I'resident Dole and Special Agent Sewall
deny having any knowledge of a con
templated change.
The Hawaiian Islands are having
trouble relative to the influx of Chinese.
Many are seeking admittance to the
United States via Honolulu. During the
past month twenty-four arriving on the
I'oyo Maru were rejected. All had affi
davits setting forth their right to land.
The vessel is strongly guarded and the
authorities will see that the Chinese re
turn to Yokohama.
The ship Sir George Curtis and bark S.
C. Allen, both from San Francisco, ar
rived at Honolulu on October 18. They
left San Francisco on October 8, on a
race, and arrived within a few hours of
tach other. On the evening of the first i
day out a cabin boy of the Curtis named
Fred Gieseke was washed overboard and
drowned. The vessel was making thirteen
knots an hour and darkness had set in,
6o no assistance could be rendered.
Honolulu is on the eve of a coal fam
ine, caused by the largo number of trans- !
ports calling, -which have made serious I
Inroads on the supply of army coal, and
Colonel Ruhlen has been compelled to
borrow 2000 tons from the navy to supply
the last transports sailing for Manila.
The navy coal Is nearly exhausted and
the commercial supply is so nearly de
pleted that if some of the expected coal
fleet do not appear within a short time
come of the sugar mills will have to close,
as ell as other factories. Several ves
sels with coal are daily expected, among
them being the bark Noody, 173 days out
from Norfolk, and from which no tidings
have been received since she started on
her voyage.

FRANCHISE
IS GRANTED
Electric Line From San
Jose to Alviso.
Biwctal Dispatch to The C*.IL
SAN JOSE, Oct. 80.â The Board of Su
pervisors this morning granted A. oreen
lnger a franchise for an Â©lectrlo road on
First street and the Alviso road to Alvl
-80. The price paid was JSO. It gives him
the easterly twelve feet of the road from
the northerly city limits. Work is to com
mence within six months and shall be
completed in eighteen months. This la
the franchise that was laid over by the
Board of Supervisors last Wednesday at
the request of ex-Boss Rea. who Is sup
posed to have been working In the Inter
ests of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The
vote to-day was not unanimous. Supervis
ors George E. Rea and F. L. Cottle op
posing the franchise. Those voting for it
were Supervisors Austin, Roll and Stem.
The efforts of business men are supposed
to have brought about the change, as last
Wednesday Supervisor Roll was the only
one in favor of granting the franchise.
The building of the road to connect Al
viso and San Jose Is but the beginning
of a large electric railway system. With
the improvements the Government Is
about to make at Alviso this will give San
Jose a good water route with all coast
points and a reduction in freights and
fares,
A proposition is also on foot to build
an electric road to Los Gatos by way of
Campbell and also to convert the Alum
Rock motor road into an electric line.

out and arrived there before midnight.
There have been several railroad acci
dents in this locality recently, but the
one to-night is the most severe of any.
One of the trainhands had a narrow es

The Sacred Duty of Every Republican.
It is the sacred duty of every Republican to give his loyal sup-
port to his party nominees in this campaign and to cast his ballot
for them on November 7. Unusual conditions prevail which mean
that defeat now will work future disaster to our party. Granting
everything that has been said in behalf of the Democratic nominee
for Mayor, it still remains for Republicans to vote for Horace '
Davis. No better man than he could have been chosen for the office.
Ripe in - commercial and political experience, of sterling integrity,
Horace Davis will give to San. Francisco an ideal administration.
He is progressive, has intimate knowledge of the needs of the city
and the executive ability in a marked degree to take charge of pro-
jected public improvements and successfully execute them, being in
every way peculiarly qualified for the position. Republicans have
only to stop and consider the vital importance to our party of this
election to give Horace Davis and his associates on the Repub-
lican municipal ticket their stanch support.

The Qualities of Horace Davis!
With Horace Davis at the head of the Republican municipal
ticket there can be not the slightest excuse for any loyal citizen to
refuse it his ardent support. Mr. Davis, above all others, is qualified
to fill the office of Mayor. A resident of this city for a third of a cen-
tury, he has been closely identified with its commercial, educational
and political interests. His has been a model life in every respect.
He has honored the community by accepting this nomination; the

must not be repudiated. A vote for Horace Davis means an in-
dorsement of the administration of President William McKinley.
Further, I consider the personal attack on Mr. Davis by one â¢of our

Officers Take Precedence at
The Tables.

patch to the Times from a staff corre
spondent traveling eastward with the
Twentieth Kansas Regiment states that
a large number of the former privates of
the regiment have revolted against their
former superior officers and registered an
emphatic declaration of Independence and
equality. The revolt came at Barstow,
Cal., where the regiment arrived for
breakfast at 10 o'clock In the morning.
The men, who were hungry as wolves,
found the eating-house doors barred and
were told that they would have to wait
for breakfast. Upon entering the tele
graph office one of the privates learned
that thirty-five breakfasts had been or
dered In advance for the officers and an
other private who peered through a rear
window found the men who wore shoul
der straps already seated at tables eating.
Immediately there was an assault upon
the eating-house. Doors were broken In
and the regiment swarmed through the
hall. When Colonel Metcalf attempted
to quiet the men he met with a storm
of abuse and several of the more ob
streperous "citizens" threatened to do
him bodily injury. The men were finally
quieted by the bringing in of their break
fast. After it was all over Colonel Met
calf went among the men and told them
that if there were to bo any more second
tables the officers would wait until the
last.

clubs as weapons took place between N.
Johnson and a man named Dan Folkener
about 8 o'clock this evening. As a result
of the fight Folkener iies at the Morgue a

reluctant to go, and the groceryman, be
coming angry, tried to force him out. The
i men grappled with each other. Near the
I door was a pile of sticks. Johnson
i grabbed one of these and Folkener an
: other. The first blow was struck by Fol
kener, so Johnson claims. At any rate

fled until they reached the yard outside.
After reaching a point about fifty feet
from where the fight first began Johnson,
i according to his own story, dean, his an-
I tagonist a blow in the back of the head,
I which felled him. At this point a neigh
bor rushed up and went to the rescue of
the man on the ground. "Don't touch
him," said Johnson, "ne'U get up and
light again."
An examination of the wounded man,
however, revealed the fact that his neck
was broken and he was already dead.
Few marks were visible on his face.
Johnson was arrested and subsequently
released on SfiOOO ball.
The dead man comes of a good family,
! well known in Fresno and he always bore
I a good reputation.

The sufferings of the young, the ten-

cite sorrowful compassion and a yearn-

And in the light of a great discov-
ery all the rose buds of sweet woman-
hood may see the promise of their
speedy release from all those suffer-
ings which have been the bane of their
sex from, the earliest times.
They need only take that greatest of
modern medicines, Warner's Safe Cure,
as directed, and their past sufferings
will soon appear to them as a painful
dream from which they have awak-
ened to dream no more. "It is a rem-

STUBBS MADE CLAIM HE
ONLY WANTED GOOD MAN
Conference Devised in Yellow
Building.
Tricky Plan to Get Interstate Commissioner
Who Should Represent Huntington's
Interest and Not the Coast's.
SOME surprise was occasioned by the
publication in The Call Sunday
morning of all the facts concern
ing the conference in the Southern
Pacific 'offices last week between H.
E. Huntlngton, J. G. Stubbs and the ex- .
ecutive committee of the Pacific Coast
Jobbers' -and Manufacturers' elation. .
The facts were correctly reported. Mr.
Stubbs then and there declared that he j
had nominated General N. P. Chipman i
and further said that he would not with- '
draw his stiport from Chipman. That is |
a pnrt of the current history of the move- j
inent in which the mercantile interests j
of the Pacific Coast are concerned large- ,
ly. But there is another chapter that has ;
not heretofore, bfen told. Btubba knew
earlier than did the merchants that there
would be a vacancy upon the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The merchants
received the information through him. The
story of the meeting, when they learned j
the facts, is one of unusual Interest.
Two leading merchants were requested |
by Mr. Stubbs to call upon him on tne :
Sd day of October. They went to the yel
low building and there mot Stubbs.
The subject matter was made known j
with little delay. Mr. Stubbs told them .
that he â¢â â â â â â  received a letter from the j
East and that therein the news came that
v. . J. Call) had sent In his resignation
us a member of the Interstate Commerce '
Commission and that it was to take effect j
upon the Ist day of October. The news j
had not yet reached San Francisco by i
wire. Stubbs had requested the mer
chants to â¢â ..â â  and talk about trie Inter- :
state Commerce Commissionershlp, so he I
said. He considered that it would be a j
good thing to have the- vacancy on the ;
commission tilled by a man from and rep
resenting the Pacific Coast. "He need not j
be a professional man to fill the position j
well; not necessarily.*" said Stubbs. |
"but he should be a business manâ one ,
well acquainted with the business and
traffic peculiarities of the coast.
Stubbs then Invited th two merchants .
to express their opinions in the matter.
They both concurred with Stubbs that !
the coast ought to be represented by an |
Interstate Commerce Commissioner. Then i
one of the merchants asked Stubbs if he â 
had any choice tor a Commissioner. ;
"No." said Stubbs, emphatically, "no, i
I have no one to offer; all that I want is
v Brood man for the place."
The merchants believed that Stubbs was i
net ing in good faith, and that he meant .
what he said. j
"Tlil' first thins to he done,' said
Stubbs; "is to get the commercial bodies !
of the whole coast to petition the Presi- j
dent to recognize the Pacific Coast in !
making the appointment. Some one must ;
Be? the newspapers and get the ball to
rolling. I cannot do that, for the news
papers are in such a rabid mood concern
ing the Southern Pacific Company that
they would not listen to me."
Some additional conversation took place, j
Finally the merchants went away, having j
it firmly Impressed upon their minds that j
Stubbs Â« had no candidate. They realized j
fully; then, that the selection of a busi
ness man. conversant with conditions
upon the Pacific Coast, would bo of bene
fit to the commercial community. It
never once dawned upon them that :
Stubbs, acting for the Southern Pacific
Company, would be guilty of trying to
have the company's own attorney select
ed as member of a commission before
which the company might have to appear
to answer charges, aa a defendant, at any |
time. Tiie sequel shows how badly they j
were mistaken. ;
The mercantile organizations of this I
city held meetings and recommended to I
President McKinley that some Pacific j
Coast man should be nominated as Com- j
missioner. While they were doing this. '
and securing the co-oppration of the com
mercl bodies in other cities, it may be,
or may not be the fact, that Stubbs :
"snickered ,'.' as the 'Ing is, "in his
sleeve." Certainly, the Pacific Coast
Traffic Association, the temporary body
that Immediately : â¢ ceded the Pacific
Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation, did not know that Stubbs even.
then had a Joker in his hand, when they
were preparing to enlist the co-operation
of th coast.
When The Call first made known the
fact that the Southern Pacific Company
was taking advantage of the situation to
try to got the President to name the rail
road company's attorney general aston
ishment was occasioned. A large num
ber of leading business men of the city
In Interviews named tho requisites for a I
candidate who could do full justice to the
busin< and transportation interests of
the Pacific Coast.
"He must be a business man; one ac
quainted intimately with traffic matters
ânot a lawyer or politician.
The last provision was dwelt upon
by many merchants who are leaders in
commercial circles.
Mr. Stubbs, who says that he nominated
Chlpman. Justified tho opinion of many
public spirited men in California and else*- i
where. concerning ths ethics of the yel
low "knockery," by getting out and into
circulation a petition to President Me-
Kinley to name Chipman for Commis-
Hiomr, and the merchants knew nothing
of the matter. A number of merchants
iind others were induced to sign the pe
tition in behalf of Chipman, when it was I
taken around in this city by H. B. Car
penter, and in Sacramento by D. O. Mills ;
upon the same sort of representation'
FREIGHT RATES
TO THE ORIENT
SHOVED UPWARD
The Roads Want More
Money.
Romp time ago the different transcon
tinental roads, Inspired by the Southern j
J'acific Company, decided to raise the
on all the principal commodities
shipped out of this country to the great
distributing points In the Orient. This
to be accomplished by an agreement
<1 Into between the various roads
and their ocean steamship connections,
and the only reason for the move was
found in the increased business be
liik done between the I'nlted States and
eastern world and the situation
which, since the commencement of the
war, has been a lack of vessels for char
tÂ«r. This scarcity of bottoms has placed
the merchants In a position of being
obliged to accept any additional burden
that the roads decide to place upon them,
for the reason that they control the only
means of getting the goods, which, In
cases have been already Bold, Eo
the markets for which they are destined.
As many of these sales were based on
the old schedule of freight rates It is easy
that tho coast should have a I
tlve on the commission.
More than oni merchant who happened
trustee or preside nt of â 
zation of commercl il or Indu
.: â â  asked whether he ob
;in added
to his name on th< petition. Merchants
did not know that there would be anj
oth< â  the field. They per
mitted their names to be slgi
clals.
Thus tho railroad appeared to have
grained the indorsement of several
Izations, when It really had only Individ
ual signatures. One organixal
thus was signed up, the Bigner h ivlng
been misled, has since Indorsed Mr.
Wheeler as a body. The president of an
other organization signed as . .
ual. but on the petition the institutl
h he Is the official head was made
ppear to Indorse Chlpman as a
Pays passed and the Chlpman petition
secretly circulated, and the great
mercantile body of the Pacitlc Coast was
In entire ignorance of what was gning un.
Then the fact was fully realized that a
sr.rakthief trick had ! een played on them.
The two business men who had called
upon Mr. Stubbs saw that he had used
them only to pull his chestnuts out of the
fire. Courtesy of the most common sort
c suggested that they should
hay been notified if Mr. Stubbs hi
hÂ« desi ribed his act at the meeting In the
yellow "knockery" last week, nominated
General Chlpman. They were as fully In
\hf dark as were all the Other merchants

BUSINESS MAN WANTED.
i LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30.âNotwithstand
j ing the indorsement of W. R. Wheeler of
I San Francisco by the Pacific Coast Job
j bers' and Manufacturers' Association to
j represent tne coast States on the Inter-
I state Commerce Commission and his
I backing of the Portland Chamber of Com
! merce, It is understood in commercial cir
cles in this city that the present compli
cated position the matter has assumed
may end in no appointment being made
from this coast. The Los Angeles com
mercial bodies are a unit for 'Wheeler, but
to-day they are Informed that General X.
P. Chipman of Red Bluff is in the running
and that he Is groomed by the Southern
Pacific. The matter is further compli
cated by the action of the San Francisco
Manufacturers' an.l Producers' Associa
tion that first Indorsed Chlpman by
adopting resolutions favorable to Chip
man, while to-day a letter is received
from the same body containing resolu
tions commending wheeler. The contest
according to the Los Angeles contingent
appears to be resolving itself Into one of
the hammering affairs for which Califor
nia has for years been noted and that
usualy end in the aspirations of the coast
being defeated.
A prominent wholsaler to-night when
asked to give an opinion said: "A polit
ical string is behind this matter. If the
Los Angeles business men are willing to
trust Wheeler our representatives can af
ford to do bo. As we are warring with
the Southern Pacific and other roads we
aÃk for a plain business man, one who
knows his business and who does not play
Into the hands of the corporations."
WHEELER INDORSED.
Two Thousand Santa Clara
Republicans Voice Their
Sentiments.
BAN JOSE, Oct. 30.â The Republican
Good Government League of Santa Clara,
which represents over 2000 Republican
voters, at a well attended meeting- passed
a resolution indorsing William R.
Wheeler for the vacancy existing In the
Interstate Commerce Commission. It was
urged that the Pacific Coast needed a
representative in that body. The follow-
In?; resolution was passed unanimously:
Resolved, That we heartily indorse the ap
pointment of William R. Wheeler of San Fran
cisco as a member of the Interstate Commerca
Commission, believing sail appointment to be
In the Interests of good government and the
future of our Golden West.
Copies of the resolution will be sent to
the President and to the Congressional
delegation representing California.
The Good Government League is made
up largely of orchardlsts, vlneyardlsts
find farmers, and the resolution* shows
the sentiments of these classes.
A motion was also carried against the
holding of a special session of the Legis
lature for the purpose of electing a T'nited
a Senator, as it was feared that Dan
Burns or some other unsuitable person
would be elected.

SCHOONER SINKS
AT STOCKTON
Mishap to the Energy,
Wheat Laden.
Special Dispatch to The CBJI.
STOCKTON. Oct. 30.â The schooner En
ergy, with 9-" 1 " sacks of choice milling
wheat on board, sunk at 3 o'clock this
, morning in Stockton Channel, just op
i posite the western end of the Union
Transportation Company's shed. There
are several reports as to what caused the
; vessel to sink. The crew of the Energy
claim that rain Boaked into the deckload
of wheat and added so much weight that
the vessel was unable to float. Others
: claim that the schooner leaked. It is de
i cleared that she had on a cargo weighing
en sixty and seventy tons, notwith
iing that her registered tonnage is
but slightly over fifty.
The schooner arrived In the channel at
about T o'clock last evening in tow of the
tug Rush. The vessel tied up at the South
Wharf, but the captain of the sen â 
i on sounding, that the water was
illow next to the wharf that wiien
thf> tide fell the boat would ground and
Ily capsize. He therefore moved the
Energy to the middle of the channel and
anchored.
But one of the crew was on the vessel
when she went down. He was In the eah
! In and narrowly escaped drowning. Had
i the water in the channel been a few feet
i deeper the sailor would not have escaped.
: As it was the top and companlonway of
i the house of the schooner were not en
tirely submerged.
The wheat belong to Jacob Simon and
was being shipped to the Sheperd Doyle
Company for storage. The wheat swelled
so that many of the sacks burst open. A
barere was tnwed alongside the sunken
ncr to-day and the work of trans
; ferring the grain from the schooner cora
i menced.

and overcomes habitual constipation

many ills resulting therefrom. The
great trouble with all other purgatives
and aperients is not that they fail to

that they act too violently and Inva-
STAFFORD SAID
"BOODLE" AND
GEDGE GOT MAD
Sudden Adjournment
of School Board.
THE SCAVENGER TO BLAME
â¢
MRS. BEANSTON REINSTATED IN
HER POSITION.
"I said boodle," grinned Director Staf
ford.
"So did I," echoed Director Stow.
"You be careful what you say, sir,"
lisped the ladylike Director Gedge; and
then to avoid the wrath to come from Di
rector Conlon's business partner Director
Eels moved that the Board (if Education
adjourn and President Bergerot turned
lot se a Bigh of relief and ordered it done.
A matter of saving Director Cole some
thing like VuO per month was behind it all.
It is common talk in the School Depart
ment that the present scavenger whose
duty it is to keep the schools free of gar
hires the wagon he uses from Cole,
who, when he i 3 not attending school
meetings, is In the teaming business. Last
August one of the members of the Scav
engers' Union offered to do the work for
$5u a month less and furnish his own
wagon. He has been offering to do it ever
since. His proposition, however, has been
combated from the ;start by directors
Armstrong, Conlon, Gedge, Kemp and at
times Bergerot. It came up again last
night and Director Stafford got up to ask
why, if hiring the new man would save
the city $50 a month, it was not done, he
Insinuated that only one reason could
stand In the way of so commendable a
measure of economy.
Gedge got up to explain. "Boodle,"
laughed Stafford, and "-Boodle." said Stew.
"You arc a lot of cheap guys," yelled
Kemp, jumping to the assistance of Di
rector Conlon' a partner. Gedge demanded
that Stafford repeat what he had said
and Stafford obligingly complied. Then.
Oedge let loose his threateneing warning
and Mr. Eels got nervous and the meet
ing was out. Cole's scavenger, however,
r'-mained.
The board reinstated Mrs. Emily Bean-
Bton In her position as teacher in the de
partment and ordered warrants drawn on
the Treasurer for her back salary. Mrs.
Beans ton' a case was Introduced by Presi
dent Bergerot, who announced the de
cision of Judge Seawell. Director Stow
moved that an appeal be taken to the Su
preme Court, but Directors Brandenstcin,
Gedge and Head objected on the ground
that nothing was to be gained by such
procedure. Gedge moved to lay Stow's
motion over a week, but there being no
second the vote was ordered on the or
iginal question. There were six ayes and
6 noes and the motion was declared lost,
as seven votes were required to pass it.
A writ of mandate had been served on
President Bergerot earlier in the evening,
and pursuant to Its directions the board
then ordered Mrs. Beanston reinstated
and her back salary paid.
Superintendent Webster reported that
the Italian classes being taught In the Le
Conte School by request of the Italian
Board of Languages behaved so badly
that the neighborhood would not stand It.

not only to the originality and simplic-

rules be amended to read: "Principals and

any other compensation, to pupils of their

any building or room belonging to the Public
School Department. "
The resignations of Mrs. J. S. Drew (nee
Fredericks) and Miss Edna J. Scott were
received and referred to the committee.
Director Holbrook, chairman of *he
Finance Committee, reported that that
body had authorized the purchase of
enough coal for use in the schools until
the middle of November. Chairman Hol
brook also recommended that the board
enter into a contract with the Remington
Typewriter agents for the lease of fifty '
typewriters for twenty months at three
dollars per month each. The contract pro
vided that if the payments were kept up
through the twenty months, ownership in ,
tho machines should pass to the depart- j
ment. The action of the committee in or
dering coal was indorsed and the type
writer lease was adopted, with the pro
vino that it be submitted to Attorney
Samuel Knight and Director Eels 'or
their approval. The buildings and grounds
committee was authorized to expend dur- I
ing November not to exceed $1600 in nee- j

MANY PANTHERS FOUND
IN MARIN COUNTY
Dairymen and Farmers at Some Dis
tance Removed From Towns
Much Frightened.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 30.â 50 many pan
thers seem to be roaming around Marin
County at present that the dairymen and
farmers living away from the vicinity of
towns and villages are kent in a state of
apprehension. The latest instance of a
panther frightening dairymen occurred
this morning when two of the species, a
male and a female, appeared at Dutaro's
ranch near Point San Pedro and killed a
yearling calf. Dutaro saw John Smith.
:i well-known market hunter of this city,
passing by and besought his aid In kill
ing the ferocious beasts. Smith dis
charged a shotgun at the panthers, which
fled into the hills.
Last week a panther chased the 10
--year-old son of Charles Orcutt in Chileno
: Valley and was frightened away from the
i intended victim by two dogs. A month
I ago two of the hungry beasts attacked a
| sea lion nn Hog Island, at the entrance
to Tomales Hay. and succeeded in killing
it after a terrific encounter, in which they
j were both badly injured.
STATE'S GOVERNOR ON
THANKSGIVING DAY
Proclamation Said to Be the Shortest
of the Character Ever Issued
in California.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 30.â The Governor
to-day issued a Thanksgiving proclama
tion, which is said to be one of the short
est ever issued by a California Governor.
It is as follows:
"In obedience to the universal and
praiseworthy American custom of setting
apart a day for public thanksgiving and
prayer to almighty God, and for the per
formance of charitable works; and, fur
ther, in conformity with the proclamation
of the President of the United States of
America, given at the city of Washington,
D. C, October 25. 1599. I. Henry T. Gage,
as Governor of the State of California,
do hereby proclaim Thursday, the 30th
day of November, A. D. IS3O, as Thanks
giving day, and I do hereby declare the
same a legal holiday."

dicinal properties of the remedy are
obtained from an excellent combina-
tion of plants known to be medici-
nally laxativ > and to act most
beneficially.
As the true and original remedy

by the California Fig Syrup Co. only, a
knowledge of that fact will assist in
avoiding the worthless imitations man.
ufactured by other parties. The high
standing of the California Fig Syrup '
Co. with the medical profession, and
the satisfaction which the genuine
Syrup of Figs has given to millions of
families make the name of the com-
pany a guarantee of the excellence of
its remedy.
POLITICAI/.
CITIZENS'
NON-PARTISAN
PARTY.
FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
To the Voter* of Pan Francisco: The Non-
Partisan pnrty was organized seven years ago
to wrest from professional politicians the con-
trol of municipal affairs and to separate en-
tirely from national politics the selection of
city and county officials.
It hns at all times opposed machine politics.
and sought to elect worthy men to office by in-
dependent nomination or indorsement.
The last Legislature passed a law express!?
aimed at the "unwelcome Interference" in
public affairs of non-partisan organization?.
The Rioknrd act forbids any information on the
I. allot concerning the indorsements that a can-
didate may receive and makes It impossible for
a man to he nominated by two parties. Sad
a creditable occurrence as th" nomination last
year by the two great parties of John LÂ«ack-
mann for Supervisor could not be repeatel.
We regard this law as pernicious In prlnclpls
and against public policy, and we intend to
vigorously contest It.
The adoption of a non-partisan charter. thÂ»
result of the last primary election, and the In-
dependent character of the recent Republican
and Democratic conventions, clearly Indicate,
however, that the friends of good government
have awakened toÂ« their dut
With these changed conditions we fee! thn-
there is no occasion for an entire Non-Partlsar.
ticket at this election.
It is, however, a fundamental principle of
this party to support those nominees who hayÂ«
faithfully and fearlessly filled their offices ana
nre renominated for the same office. We would
fall in our obligations were we to leave this
work undone.
â  We therefore unqualifiedly recommend for
your suffrage at the coming election:
For Mayor JAMES D. PHELAN
For Assessor. WASHINGTON DODGE
For Auditor ASA R. WELLS
For City and County Attorney...
FRANKLIN K. LANE
To each of these faithful servants of the
people there is certainly due a generous meas-
ure of credit and encouragement, for the able
and honest manner in which they have ful-
filled their public trust.
This committee, furthermore, realising the
difficulty for each individual voter to inform
himself as to the qualifications of the many
candidates for the Board of Supervisors, has
given careful and impartial study to the rela-
tive merits of the nominees on the several
tickets.
As the result of continuous work by this
committee, extending over a month's time, re-
garding this important department of the city
government, we feel Justified in recommending
for your support and vote, irrespective of
party lines, the following eighteen citizens, se-
lected from the Republican and Democratic
tickets, to constitute the first Board of Super-
visors under the new charter:

to think that they are funny. Meanwhile
another phase of the population is enjoy
j ing flve times as good specialties at the
] Orpheum and pocketing half the price
that the others spend. ;
Every one of the farces that has been i
presented has had one hitâ precisely one. j

I must, for the rest, listen to wit that is
| not witty and watch business that is not
I new, the evening might be better spent.
What is the trouble? Is New York so
! easily pleased, or do the entertainers
think wo are not worth much effort? :
I Speculate who will. The fact remains
that the farce season at the Columbia Is
now in the sere and yellow leaf, and only
two or three funny things have happened
I in its whole course. There is one more
chanceâ "Why Smith Left Home"â if
! Smith is as futile as his predecessors,
; then let us conclude that the times are
out of joint.
â¢'By the Sad Sea Waves" lacks the
rattle-ty-bang that made "Hotel Topsy
Turvy" endurable, and it has not the old
prejudice in its favor that helped "A Milk
White Flag." It is frankly Hat. It does
not make any strenuous effort beyond the
composing of the programme, to be a
joke, and, simple logic, it is not. It is
very, very insipid. Bessie Challenger
I gives promise during the first act of keep
, ing on the safe side of Sis Hopkins and
not overdoing her, much as Sis tempts.
Nonsense! What is the use supposing for
a minute that anybody but Rose Melville
I could steer safely through the song and
dance? Open pops the chance, and In falls
Bessie.
The women of the company can't do
anything but sing, and the men can't do
even that. The plot of the farce is the
least thread that a play was ever strung
upon. But you are expected to laugh.
It may come easier with practice. There
will be almost two weeks more in which
to try. SARAH COMSTOCK.

Why do people go into such ecstasies

theaters, where Felix Mottl, the cele

Impression. Merrltt's imitations of sharp

verted the house into a veritable
bower, and shaded lights heightened
the effect. Promptly at S o'clock the
ceromony began. Thp bride wore a
handsome traveling gown of brown
broadcloth, and was as beautiful as a
bride could be. Mrs. Bird wore an
elegant creation of black lace over
silk. Only the relatives were present.
As a whole the affair was kept very
quiet on account of the recent death
of the groom's father, Jacob Rosen
berg, who was one of the most promi

The bride was given away by her
brother, Marshall Bird, who lately
won renown as one of Roosevelt's

went with perfect smoothness nnd the
principals won a number of recalls.
The Chutes.
Frank Hall, an English lion-tamer, gave
a thrilling performance with Wallace, the
handsome lion from the Zoo at the Chutes
Theater last night. He cowed the big
beast only with the aid of blank car
tridges fired in its face, and the audience
responded with tumultuous applause.
Major Mite gave a new specialty; Adgie
sang "Since Rachel Ran Away With a

There will be no delay in getting the
three regiments now at the. Presidio away
for the Philippines. They have all been
assigned to transports, not by orders as
yet, but their vessels have been decided
upon, and the last of them will sail on
November 6 if nothing happens to change
the programme.
The Forty-fifth, under command of
Colonel John H. Dorst, will win the prize.
i It will be assigned to the transport Han
cock, admitted to be the finest troopship
now in the service. Colonel Dorst's regi

ator and the Ben More, the Senator to
sail on the 3d and the Ben More on the Ist.
The measles that developed in the Thir
ty-eighth Regiment has grown no worse,
and it is not thought the regiment will be
delayed any on account of It. The first
cases that developed were left behind at
Jefferson Barracks, and those which were
discovered just after the regiment reached
camp were sent at once to the general
hospital, and all who had been in contact
with the cases were isolated.
The Forty-sixth was inspected by the
department Inspector general. Lieutenant
Colonel Maus, yesterday. To-day he will
inspect the Forty-fifth and to-morrow he
will reach the Thirty-eighth. The inspec

DONATELLO, THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR.

IIL DONATELLO.
Among the great masters of the Italian
renaissance the name of Donatello stands
out prominently, for the man's work was
so Individual, so essentially appealing and
artistic and so altogether delightful that
it attracts alike the artist and laymanâ
the former for its delicious technique and
masterly manipulation, as well as for its
originality; the latter because of Its hu
manity, its realism and its delicacy, of
fering not only the beauty of externals,
but having the inner suggestlveness that
furnishes food for speculation and analy
sis. One little bas-relief by Donatello has
a world-wide reputation and common
plaster of paris replicas of it may be
found In thousands of households where
even the sculptor's name is unknown; but
wherever it is it gives satisfaction and
furnishes possjbly unsuspectedly an ar
tistic gratification which few plastic rep
resentations afford. It is the little "Saint
Cecilia," the profile of a lovely woman,
with a sweet expression; but vith this
simple motive the artist has given a gen
uine masterpiece that has stood the test
of centuries and remains to-day one of
the gems of the world of art.
We speak of the man as Donatello, and
so he Is known to the world. In truth, his
name was Donato di Nlcolo di Betti Bardi,
and he was the son of a wool-comber In
Florence, Italy, where he was born In 1386.
Although the boy could not by hereuity
lay claim to any notions of art, his sub
sequent taste for it may be explained by
the fact that at an early age he was taken
into the house of the noble family of the
GROUP OF DANCING CHILDREN.
Martelli. who had always been patrons
and lovers of art. At any rate, brought
up amirt the artistic surroundings In the
establishment of this cultivated family.
it Is probable that he imbibed good taste
; and a love for the best things. As to his
i masters there is much doubt, and they
i are altogether a matter of speculation.
! He is said to have been a pupil of Bacd
di Lorenzo and to have studied with the
father of the famous Ghiberti. but of this
there is no proof. It is certain that ho
assisted the great Ghiberti in casting tne
i marvelous bronze gates for the Baptistry
[ in Florence and that he was an intimate
j of Filippo Brunellesco, who, though some
| ten years older that Donatello, found the
â  latter companionable.
It was to this man Brunellesco that Don
atello brought one of his first efforts, a
crucifix carved in wood, which did not
meet with approval, for the older man
remarked that the lad had crucified a eon
tadinoâthe Italian for countryman or
peasantâ meaning that he had missed en
tirely the significance of the figure of
Christ. At this Donatello was enraged
and in a fit of boyish anger advised Bru
nellesco to go and do better. This Bru
nellesco was able to do and. having fin
ished a similar subject, he invited Dona
tello to come and see it. The boy stopped
on his way from market, his hands full
of supplies, and at a sight of the master
piece he was overcome with emotion, let
ting drop his eggs nnd choose. Looking
at the exquisite work he exclaimed: "To
thee it is given to sculpture a Christ; I
can only rrake peasants." However, with
I this man Donatello made a pilgrimage to
Rome and profited by his comradeship.
On his return to Florence, in 1405, he en
tered the crowded studio of Ghiberti, do
ing much independent work, and for seven
or eight years he devoted himself to mak-
I ing large statues, many of which nave
i achieved world-wide fame. He did his fa
mous "David" for the Duomo, or Cathe
dral of Santa Maria del Fiore, the author
ities of which gave him many commis
sions, which included a "Daniel," a
"Joshua" and an old man. He did like
wise a "St. John Evangelist" for the fa
cade, and he collaborated with Brunel
lesco on a statue of marble covered with
gilded lead. The guilds of Florence at
this time were great patrons of art. and
each strove to outdo the other in patri
otic gifts to the city, employing the first
artists in the work. The Guild of Armor
ers commissioned Donatello to make a
ers commissioned uonaieno u> inan.e a
statue for the Church of Or San Miehele.
His work was the famous "Saint George,"
and in this he succeeded to a remarkable
degree in combining nobility of form,
youth, simplicity, proportion and richni as
of decoration. The statue stands to-day as
the accepted type of the church militant.
There followed the well-known marble
"David." a delicate figure that is a mar
velous conception of power in apparent
I weakness.
Donatello did much work for the cathe
dral and the Campanile, and executed
many private commissions for various im
portant patÂ»ons, including a marble lion
for the staircase of the Pope's house in
Santa Maria Novella. After this he exe
cuted an important scries of tombs, be
ginning with that of Pope John XXI II, In
the Baptistry in Florence, a serious de
sign, partly in bronze and partly in mar
ble. In 1-128 he was employed by Cosimo
and Lorenzo de Medici to erect a sepul
chral monument for their father and
mother in the sacristy of San Lorenzo,
and Aragazzi, secretary to Pope Martin
V, ordered a tomb for himself, which is
said to have been a masterpiece , although
now it is dismembered and dispersed
about the church. He went to Rome for
the second time in 1433, and did very much
work there, including a statue of "St.
John the Baptist" for S. Giovanni in La
terano, a bust for the Church of S. Maria
1 Dyke, Dr. Russell Sturgis, Dr. A. L. Froth
others.
Maggiore and a tabernacle of the sacra
ment in S. Pietro.
On his return to Florence he began his
reliefs for the singing gallery over the
sacristy in the cathedral, and these are
among his most famous productions, as
well as among the most popular. Lucca
della Robbia had the commission for
similar work for the organ gallery. Each
is a gem in its way. In that by Donatello
there are singing men and women, groups
of laughing, dancing cherubs, beautifully
modeled and conceived. A famous work
is a bronze group of "Judith and Holo
fernes" in the L,oggia de Lanzi. Presently
the sculptor went to Padua, where ho did
a great deal of work, among other things
a crucifix, this time worth the while, and,
as may be imagined, a decided improve
ment on his youthful attempt. While still
in Padua he made a large equestrian
statue of the famous general of the
Venetian army, Erasmus Narnl, better
known as Gattamelata. This is said to
have been the first equestrian statue since
the time of the Romans. He also carved
many wooden statues, generally for
churches.
So the man worked on, achieving suc
cess after success, leaving in almost
everything he touched the mark of his
great genius, but all through his career
neither adulation nor success had the
slightest effect on his character. To the
end of his long life of eighty years he re
mained simple, natural and unaffected. It
is said that he was not only loved by all
who knew him, but that he never lost a
friend. The great Cosimo de Medici was
not only his patron, he was his warm
BY DONATELLO.
friend, but, though he enjoyed an inti
macy with the sculptor, he never suc
ceeded in making him a fashionable after
the manner of the set with which the rich
man mingled. Once, thinking that Dona
tello did not dress as handsomely as he
ought. Cosimo sent him as a present a
rich scarlet cloak, a cap and a doublet.
Donatello wore this finery but once, and
then he returned the gorgeous raiment,
Baying that it made him very uncomfort
able.
On the death of Cosimo he recommended
the sculptor to the keeping of his son,
who gave the great artist a country
house at Caffagiuolo. For a while Dona
tello was delighted at being a landed
proprietor, but in the end, after a year's
ownership, he begged to be relieved of the
burden and responsibility of the property.
Pietro de Medici made him happy by giv
ing him a settled pension, and from that
time he lived simply in a modest house
with his mother and widowed sister, for
he never married. He was a bohemlan
in the best sense of the word, enjoying
the companionship of his brother artists
and the mild joys of his home life.
On December 13, 144fi, after having been
a long time paralysed, ho died in his own
house, and was buried in San Lorenzo,
where Cosimo already had prepared for
him a sepulcher. Donatello had many
pupils, some of whom occupied important
positions in the history of Italian sculp
ture. Among them may be mentioned
Bertoldo <li Giovanni, Nanni di Antonio
di Banco, Vallano da Padua. Desiderio da
Settignano and Miehelozzo Miehelozzi.
Some of these imitated the master to a
surprising degree, but none of them
reached his excellence. There is an in
effable charm about all the work of Don
atello that is difficult to describe, but
which Is instantly realized, and by the
power of his Individuality, the exquisite
delicacy of his technique and the spirit
uality of hi< Idealizations, he must b^
counted among the very foremost of the
sculptors of all times. Scarcely a painter
or a sculptor since his day has been un
influenced at some time or other by his

cerity, delicacy or simplicity that have
attracted the artistic miml and held it

EASTERN MARKETS.
ck Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. SÂ«.â Prices of stocks moved
Uprvard In the early dealing* to-day according
to the general anticipation, but contrary to
expectations a serious obstacle to the advance
svas met In the violent rise In the rate of call
money. The advance did not extend far Into
the second hour when the market began to
drift downward and met. no effectual check
until the clesi?, which was at about the low
point a:-.d with prices etill giving way to pres- I
sure. No serious net losses are shown In the
railroad list, but the earlier gains, which
amounted to a t<unt and upward in many
ca_Â«trÂ«, were pretty generally wiped out. The
jnarket opened with a strong and animated
t^r.e and a large volume of outside buying
friers, invited by the unexpected strength or I
th? Saturday tank statement. Tlie demand was
particularly large Â£or the grangers and South
westerns and for some ol the Southern raJl
r.^ad stocks, notably Louisville, which was up
I'm at one time. This s.vÂ«_-k resisted the later
depression with sr.ir.* turoess. l.ut closed 7 Â»
bÂ»:ow the best. Even the much-hammered
Industrials had some share In the early
strength. Sugar rose an extreme 2 points be
fore yielding to pressure and the Iron and
steel stocks had a short-lived period of vigor.
Pressure promptly developed against Steel and
Wire uii'i it was weak for the rest of the day,
affecting other members of the group by sym
pathy. Federal Steel was exceptionally firm.
The Leather stocks continued to be largely
i. but the gain in the preferred was
entirely lost before the close. The International
japr Â«toyks were fiercely attacked, the com
mon being forced down 3-Â» and the preferred
4 points. ihe latter recovered 3 points of
Its loss. Rumors coming from Holland of the
fall of I*adysmith were without much effect,
as London seemed disposed to discredit them.
The September statement of St. Paul had a
discouraging effect on speculators, showing as
Jt did the large increase In gross earnings
obliterated by the heavy increase in operating
expenses, so that the net earnings for the
month are already over (260,000 less than In
September of last year. The effect was es
pecially marked upon all the grain-carrying
roa.ls. The day's events in the call money
market showed th:it the extent of the recu
peratlon by New York banks was grossly ex
aggerated in the first enthusiasm over the
Saturday statement. The rate opened at S
per cent, and alter dropping to Tjj per cent
rose violently in the late dealings to 20 per
cent. Bids were made for 40 per cent, but the
closing transaction was at 10 |>er cent. It was
a Btrlklng demonstration of the unfit condition
of the morey market to maintain an active
speculation. New York exchange fen sharply
at some Southern and Western points to-day
although it was harder at Chicago and at
Jicston. It Is evident that the demands of the
Interior are not yet exhausted. The sub
treasury has absorbed a considerable sum from
the banks since Friday and some extra demand
Is coming on the market for November 1 set
tlement. Wai! street opinion upon the money
cutlook fell quickly from extreme optimism
down into the minus tigures of pessimism.
Bonds moved in sympathy with stocks, but
the early gains were not entirely wiped out
In the late reaction. Total sales, par value,

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. 30.â Wheat opened In a tame
and spiritless manner and throughout the ses-
Elon almost an entire lack of interest was evi
dent. There was nothing in the situation to
encourage either buying or selling and prices
slowly but steadily depreciated owing mainly
to lack of sympathetic support. The market
kept just a shade above put figure, until the
end of the session, the range being only He.
when covering : -.â¢ a few shorts started a
slight rally and the market closed barely :
steady. December opened a shade lower at ;
69"i^70c. sold sparingly at 70c. declined to
6&HC and closed with buyers at 6STiÂ£7oc. Chi
cago received -74 cars.
The visible supply Increased 1,006.000
bushels, which though nearly 1,000,000 bushels
less than expected, was enough to exort a |
slight bearish influence. World's shipments to
Europe during the week were 7,864, 000 bushels,
against 8,475,000 bushels the same week last
year, but still about 600.000 bushels In excess
of European weekly requirements. Atlantic
port clearances of wheat and flour equaled
ien.ooo bushels. Cash demand here was very ;
. slow.
Corn was active but rather steady. A poor
cash demand coupled with heavy receipts and
predictions of an Increased movement In the
near future owing to perfect weather encour
aged liquidation. under which the market
gradually yielded until near the close when a |
partial recovery took place on covering. De- i
comber closed at 31 He.
A good shipping demand and buying by ele- ]
vator Interests steadied Oats. Speculative I
trading was light throughout the session. De- I
cember closed 22TÂ»c.
Ft-ar of a shortage In January Pork and
generous buying by packers strengthened Pro
visions early, but on the bulge liquidation be
came heavy and the gain was nearly all lost.
January Pork closed 5c higher; Lard and Ribs !

A big delegation of citizens from the
Western Addition went before the Board
of Supervisors yesterday to protest
strongly against any reduction being
made in the amount to be 'included in
the bond issue fur school purposes. The
amount originally fixed as necessary for
school purposes was (1,500,000. Prior to
the last meeting of the board Mayor Phe
lan and President Bergerot of the Board
of Education came together and agreed
that $1,000,000 would do, and the amount
â was forthwith reduced to that figure.
Charles Uundschu was first to speak
to the board. He argued solely for the :
Lowell High School, and said that it was
the unanimous desire of the residents of
his district that they be treated as well
at least as was the Mission, when the
Mission High School was erected.
â¢ Attorney Frank Gould represented the ,
"Western Addition Improvement Club, and
he, too, spoke for the Lowell High School.
He said the voters in the district would
be more strongly inclined to vote for the
bond issue if they were assured that a
due portion of the amount would come ;
back to .them in the shape of substantial i
improvements. He pointed out also that
every other section of the city had been
better treated in the way of handsome j
pchool buildings than the Western Addi
ction.
stave Snee, representing the Feder
ated Improvement Clubs, echoed the opin
ions of the previous speakers, and Super
visor Perrault at once moved to raise the â 
amount from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. Super
visor Algeltinger backed him. Mayor â¢
I'helan read a letter from Mr. Bergerot, |
which said that an error had evidently
been committed in reducing the amount
at all His Honor, thought, of a conse
quence, that $1,250,000 would be enough,
but Supervisor linger opposed him
and said that education was one thing :
the city could not have too much of, and
h* believed that parsimony should be !
shown in any other than the School De- j
partment.
Then Assistant Superintendent of
Schools Marks came in and Â»the Mayor
asked him if the department could get
along without the administration and
truant school buildings. Marks replied it j
could if it tried, anil his Honor suggested j
that $1,400,000 be fixed as the amount. j
Lackmann moved as an amendment that j
that amount he fixed. When it came to i
a vote Itinger, Attridge, Collins and
Perrault voted "no," because they wanted
a million and a half instead of the lesser
figure. They afterward changed their
vote and made it unanimous.
On motion of Supervisor Phelps the
plans tor the new County Hospital went
over for another week. The board will
view the plans submitted on Friday after
noon.
A permit was granted the. National Ath- ;
letic Club to hold a professional boxing ;
â¢Contest on some evening between Novem
ber 15 and 30. Permission was granted 1
the Western Athletic Club to hold an
amateur contest between ember 1 and
15. in lieu of a permit previously granted
for a go between the loth and 30th.
A resolution was adopted calling atten
tion of the Public Buildings Committee
to the fact that under the charter there
will be eighteen Supervisors, and that |
necessary furniture for six more members
should be provided for.
A resolution was adopted empowering
the Finance Committee to invite bids for
a joint custody double combination safe
for the Treasurer, as required by the |
charter. The committee will confer with j
the Treasurer upon the description of the |
safe to be based. The whole matter j
will be referred to the Board of Super- j
visors and the resolution further pro- j
vldes that the '.-â 'â  Treasurer and Auditor
shall adjust the combination.
The following resolution by Supervisor
Perrault was adopted:
Resolved, That the City and County Attorney
be and he is hereby respectfully requested to
prepare forms of bonds to be executed and
given by all officers and appointees under the
provisions of the new charter as follows:
Firstâ By officers who will be elected by the

Secondâ Uy deputies, clerks and other em
ployes to be appointed by the Mayor to any
office In this city and county.
Third â By deputlefi, clerks and other em

partments to fill positions therein.
And the City and County Attorney Is hereby
requested to prepare the said forms of bonds â¢
|^.ln time to allow of their being: printed tor

ber, 1P59; and for the officers appointed by
his Honor, the Mayor, and for the deputies,
clerks and other employes appointed by officers
and departments of this city and county as
provided in the new charter.
The following resolution by Supervisor
Black, chairman of the Printing and
Salaries Committee, was adopted:
Resolved, That the committee on printing
and salaries be and Is hereby empowered and
required to obtain competitive bids from parties
for priming respectively 2500, 5000, 7500 and
10,000 copies of the new charter and report the
eamo to this board for such action as may
be deemed advisable, it being necessary that
a sufficient number of copies be printed for
genera! distribution.
Alfred Fuhrman was ordered employed
as special counsel for the collection of
delinquent taxes for the fiscal years 1898

Supervisor Holland submitted an ordi
nance which determined and declared
that public interest and necessity de
mand the completion of the Hall of Jus
tice as originally designed, and that in
order to. complete it the lot at the corner
of Dunbar alley and Washington street
should be acquired by the city. The ordi
nance was sued to print. -_ ? ; .?
Mayor Phelan had another explanation
to make when the gas contracts came up
and they were again put over for â  week.
jr.:- Honor said he had addressed another
letter to Mr. Crockett and had Inclosed
with It a statement signed by live mem
bers of the board to the effect that the
company bad broken Its compact in sub
mitting bids on street lights in excess of
10 cents each per night. No answer had

PASSENGERS DISCOMMODED
OAKLAND, Oct. 30.â Somewhere up
! near Sleye Station there is a crippled
', engine attached to a freight train wait

Shortly before 8 o'clock the tower man
In charge of the tower near Sixteenth
street had set the switches for a clear
track lor a freight train down Cedar
street. Just then engine No. 1404, in
charge of Engineer Harry Elejrwood,
came thundering up the track, bound for

understood th-: signals or whether he un
derstood them and could not stop in time
is not known, but his engine jumped the

I track, about 200 feet south of the tower.
He and his fireman jumped for their
lives and escaped uninjured, but the en
gine fell over mi its side, the coal tender
i takins a position which blocked the
! Berkeley local track. As a result passen
â  k<t traffic oh the Berkeley local was sus
pended until nearly midnight and resi
dents of the University town were com

By midHight the- wreck was cleared off
the Berkeley tracks, but the crippled en

Neither the tower men nor Engineer
Heywood had any information to give out
as 'to how tlie engine was ditched. It is
said Heywood waa formerly a hostler and
his fireman h wiper, and that they were

NON-UNION LABOR
GETS A ROAST
OAKLAND. Oct. 30.â Rev. C. R. Brown, pastor of the First Congrega- {
tional Church, in his sermon Sunday night, severely arraigned non- <
union labor. His manuscript has been obtaiued by local labor organi- <
zations and will be largely distributed. His most pointed remarks *
were directed at his neighbors, the Seventh-day Adventists. Referring J
to them, he said: <
"Anything else that is called religion is incomplete and Is often a carica- <
ture. Yonder or. Twelfth street stands a religious printing house. The men c
who manage it are so religious they will not observe the Lord's day. They <
will run their establishment on that day to the detriment of the quiet of the C
neighborhood and to the annoyance of many, and then keep another day of '
their own. They aro afraid they might offend God If they kept the day the \
Christian world observes. Yet with all these scruple?, they refuse to adopt (
the wholesome, industrial methods approved by organized labor and by all <
first -class printing houses In this and other American cities. They refwse to <
pay union wages or to make the conditions nf employment such as intelli- *
gent and conscientious men In the working world to-day approve. Thus their (
house has become notorious among vorkingmen all over the State. Their
great care lest they should offend God by keeping the Sabbath of all other 4
Christians and their anomalous economic position reminds us of those re- <
HgloniÃts to Whom Christ said, 'Ye tithe mint, anise and cumnrtin and neglect <
the weightier matters of justice and mercy.' " <
OAKLAND, Oct. 30 âNo officer of the Pacific Press would reply to-night <
to the remarks of Rev. C. R. Brown. *
â We all feel that these criticisms are uncalled for," said a member of the <
staff, "but if any reply is to be made it should be done by our editor-in-chiaf, <
Mr. Wilcox, who is at Healdsburg and who will return Wednesday." <

BABY'S DEATH
ATTRIBUTED TO
CRUEL NEGLECT
Officials to Probe the
Case.
The death of little two-year-old Marga
ret Cahill was reported to the Morgue
last evening. According to the account
given to Coroner Hill, the baby died of
neglect and cruelty, and the case will re
ceive a thorough probing by the police
and Morgue authorities.
Several days ago Mrs. Judill, who is
connected with one of the local orphan
asylums, visited the home of John Ca
hill, a laborer, at 920 Bryant ntreet. She
shortly afterward found Officer Cook of
the Southern police station and told hmi
a pathetic story of two children, one of
whom w;is dying of neglect. The woman
staffed that Cahill, whose wife died about
three weeks ago, was drunk in the houst,
and that one of his children, a two-year
old girl, was also at the poiiit of death.
When a^kcii why h*- did not give the
baby medical attendance Cahill replied
that h<- had had a woman attending the
children, hut that the latter had deserted
her posi of duty. Officer Cook visited the
house and Cahill promised him thai he
would Becure th<- services <>f another
mirae. The officer then reported the mat
ter tv police headquarters, and to Acting
Sergeant (/.Mara the father made the
same statement.
.Mrs. judill persisted that the child was
being neglected and wanted it removed
from the house. The father just as p ir
sistently refused to let hi> baoy be taken
away. "This occurred on Saturday alter'
noon, and last evening about H o'clock, the
child died. The woman who at lirst ac
cused the parent of inhuman treatment
anÂ«i noglect then came forward and re
ported the matter to Coroner Hill. Hill,
in the report left on the death slip, stales
that not only are charges brought against
the father, but that the woman also holds
the police responsible. The officers, bow
ever, claim that they had no right to
â  the removal of the child from its
home.
The little body lies In the parlor at 920
Bryant street. Last night the home pre
sented ;.. pitiful appearance. The father
was disgracefully Intoxicated, while his
surviving child, a boy of five years, lay ill
and unattended In the next room. The
father claims that he called In a doctor
before his little daughter died, but last
night he appeared too Intoxicated to give
either his name or address. He Imagines
that some one Is trying to rob him of the
body and is loud in imprecations against
any one who should attempt to do so.

HE MADE LOVE TO THE
FAIR WIDOW CAMPBELL
Spirits Have Called It Off, and Now Joe Perry Will Sue
Her for Back Wag.s.
â¢
OAKLAND, Oct. 30.â "J0e," the Portuguese hired man who was born
in France, whose surname turns out to be Perry and who was charged
with Insanity by Mrs. C. E. Campbell, widow of the hue Police Judge
Cnmpbfl! of San Francisco, has turned the tables on the fair-haired
widow, who created a sensation yesterday by reporting that he had
made love to her and that he had declared the spirits and (Jod had told him
he must marry her.
"Joe" voluntarily appeared before the Lunacy Commissioners to-day in
accordance with his promise made to Deputy Sheriffs Striker and Taylor
last night. The young widow also appeared. She was heavily veiled and be
fore Drs. Tlsdale and Sanborn would proceed with the examination of the
Portuguese hired man they demanded of her a $10 fee, which she reluctantly
paid. The doctors argued that it was a Berkeley case and that they had
never been able to recover fees for examining insane patients from the uni
versity town without suit.
Mrs. Campbell reiterated her story as published in The Call this morn
ing; of how "Joo" had once enticed her into one of her rooms in her
former T*Â£rkeley home and how he attempted to hypnotize her; how the man
lnul pretested his love as being urged by spirits and the spirit of the late
lamented Judge himself; and linally how he refused *to quit the Campbell
premises at Wheeler and Ashby avenues in Berkeley. She declared her life
is in dnngor while "Joe" possesses her deceased husband's big revolver.
"Joe" Perry was then asked to explain his conduct and frankly admitted
that for a few weeks he had indulged in a belief in spiritualism, but found
it too great a mystery. He admitted, ton, that on one occasion he had
told Mrs. Campbell that God wanted them to marry, but this dream, too,
had flown, he said. The spirits had called it off. He was willing to give
up the keys to Mrs. Campbell's home and the doctors promptly discharged
him. Now Perry has retained an attorney to bring suit against the widow
for back wages due a* care-taker of her place at Berkeley.

ATTACKED BY
ANGRY MUSKRATS
Police Operator Wound
ed by the Animals.
Special Dispatch to The fall.
CHICAGO, Oct. 80.-B!eeding from a I
score of wounds, J. J. Geraghty, a police
operator in South Chicago, to-day reached
his home and told a strange story of an
attack on himself ami tlog by a horde of
muskrais In a swamp along tha Calumet
River.
Geraghty entered the swamp early this \
morning to hunt for reed birds. His dog,
a magnificent Gordon Better, accompanied
htm. Shortly after noon he started home- I
ward. Suddenly the furious barking of his j
dog startled him, and he ran forward to I
find the animal literally covered with j
muskrats, which were lighting desperate
ly, biting and squealing like mad. They
nipped at Uie dog's eyes and caught his
tongue in their sharp teeth. He seemed
almost helpless, and Geraghty fired his
fhotgun at the little army of rodent.*,
which came scampering to the scene,
hoping- to scare the ones which were fast
killing his dog. He mowed down dozens
of the rats without appreciably decreas- ;
Ing their number. The dog at last sue- ;
cumbed and the reinforcements, number
ing hundreds, Geraghty sayÃ, turned their
attention to him.
"They climbed through my clothes in no j
time and bit me savagely." paid the op
erator in telling the story, "and the only \
thing that saved my life was the arrival
of a couple of other hunters, who ran in 1
with clubs and beat the little fellows off." !
Geraghty's story is corroborated by the
hunters who rescued him. Muskrats in a j
portion of the swamp are known to be i
numerous and occasionally belligerent, j
but thif is said to be the first instance ,
where they have attacked a man in any I
force. .^___________

COX MUST STAND
TRIAL IN HAVANA
I Government Insists on
His Extradition.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.â The Secretary
of War has received a letter from the
Governor of Louisiana relative to the case j
of W. A. Cox, who is now held in cub- |
tody in the city of New Orleans by the j
! State authorities of Louisiana pending
the Governor's action upon a requisition
for his surrender to the authorities of
the United States upon the charge of fel
ony, committed in Havana. The Gover
nor stated that he had received a letter
from a reputable attorney who had prac
ticed law in Havana and was well ac
quainted with Cox and the prosecuting j
witness, which contained allegations of
conspiracy against Cox in Havana and
criticisms upon the manner of adminis
tering justice there as reasons why Cox
should not be surrendered. This letter j
raised doubts in the Governor's mind as i
to what action he should take in the
premises.
In response to the Governor's letter the
Government takes the ground that the |
only question for consideration is as to I
whether there is a charge of crime duly
presented against CoX that ought to re-
I quire him to appear and answer in the
court having jurisdiction of the offense.
"We have a right," It is insisted, "to
assume that the United States is main
taining a government in Havana in which
the rights of persona and of property are
being protected, and that if we are to
permit the United States in its prox-
I imity to Cuba to be a place of refuge for
Cuban criminals the probabilities are that
a great many persons who commit crimes
in the island will escape trial and punish
ment by becoming fugitives to this coun-
RAILROAD WORK AT
SURF IS PROGRESSING
Over 1100 Men Now Employed and
Gaviota Will Be Reached, It Is
Thought, by May 1.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Oct. 30.-In the
eighteen construction camps along the
I route of the gap between Surf and Elwood
! over 1100 men are now employed. Gaviota
cannot be reached before May 1. There
are two viaducts to be built, and one tun
nel 800 or 900 feet in length to be driven.
This tunnel is located about six miles
! above Gaviota. Beyond Santa Anita
! Ranch and extending to Jalima CreeJc
: through Cojo Ranch, a distance of Â«ev
j eral .miles, there is much work still to be
done, including the completion of the lar
gest fill on the line, said by some to be
the largest railroad fill in the world.
Rails are now laid to Jalima Creek, south
from Surf, and a few miles north of Point
Concepcion.
From Jalima Creek to Gaviota is a dis
tance of about twenty miles, most of
! which has yet to be graded, with one big
fill, two large viaducts and a tunnel to
be completed before the rails can be ex
tended to the latter point.
: Half an inch of rain fell here in a heavy
shower this morning, injuring the grain.

Typhoid and Malaria Were Causing
Many Deaths at Nome When
the Steamer SailedâSui
cide en the Bertha.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
Bteamer Bertha arrived from Cape Nome,
via St. Michael and (Jnalaeka, with 3SO
miners yesterday. She had over $750,000
â¢worth of gold dust in boxes and about
J250,iÂ»00 in bags, which were placed in the
safe by the miners for safe keeping,
while each miner carried from JSOO all
the way up to $7000 en his person. In
round figures the Bertha brought down
about J3.w3.000.
The returning minors report that the
new find- reporjed by the whalers Is at
Cape York, near Cape Prince of Wales.
Charles Day brought the news of the dis
covery to Norn..-. He had been given up
for dead, as his boat had been picked up
at sea bottom up. His wife had not given
up hope, however, and was at Anvil City
to receive him on his return. Day 6ays
the Caps York diggings are richer than
Nome, and the Nome people say their dis
trict is richer than the Klondike, so out
eiders can draw their own inferences.
While the Bertha was at Anvil City hun
dreds of people were "leaving for the new
placer mines. They are much easier to
yet at than Cape Nome and wood and
â¢shelter can be procured in limited quan
tities. There will bo a ruiin to Cape York
next spring.
There was a sad fatality on the Bertha
Just before she sailed for San Francisco.
C. Clallin wont to the diggings from
Omaha and did well. He was leaving
for home, where his wife and child await
him, with $i*I,(XH), when he was taken sick
with stomach troubles, and these so
preyed upon him that in a moment of de
pression he blow his bruins out. His body
was brought to San Francisco and will
be sent to his relatives in Omaha.
J. Dinsmore was taken from the Bertha
to St. .Luke's Hospital. During the voy
age he developed typhoid fever and was
a. very sick man when the ship reached
port. He brought from Cape Nome with
lira about $;.o,uoo in gold dust. Another
sick- roan was R. G. Parks. He landed
at Capo Nome with only 25 cents in his
pocket and returns to San Francisco with
925,000 In gold dust in the vessel's strong
box. . ... * *
The men on the Bertha say that typhoid
lever and malaria are very prevalent at
Cape Nome, and, in consequence, there
are live and six deaths daily. There will
be a great deal of suffering this winter,
but the miners will not leave the diggings,
although there are plenty of boats to
bring them to civilization, The Bertha
had a permit to carry twenty more pas
sengers had any of the miners desired to
en me.
The Aloha did not lose her deckload,
but landed every ounce of her cargo at
N/nme. She will bring back a load of pas
sengers and should arrive this week.
E. E. Came of Seattle has chartered the
steamers Charles Nelson and ..-land
to run to Cape Nome and Cape York, via
St. Michael, next year. His charter will
begin next May, so people are beginning
early to get vessels for the trade. Came
Is also building a large steam schooner,
â which will run in connection, with the
Cleveland and Charles Nelson.
The steamer Humboldt will come back
here on November 7 for an overhauling,
and the chances are that she also may go
Into the Nome-York trade next year.
The steamers City of Panama and Aca
pulco arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday. Yellow fever is still
prevalent In the Isthmus, and the crews
of the steamers were not allowed ashore.
while the passengers were fumigated be
fore joining the vessel. The officers of
the Acaitulco think the disease Is being

Case of John Piggott, Pickpocket, in
the Supreme Court.
Th*Â» Supremo Court has upheld the
Judgment convicting John Piggott of
grand larceny. Piggott is, said to on*
of the most clever pickpockets in the

AN EXCITING BOAT RACE
ONE of the most exciting boat
races ever seen on the bay waa
rowed from Hunters Point to
stakeboats anchored off the bat
tleship lowa yesterday. It was be
tween two picked crews from the war
ship, and fully $10,000 changed hands
on the result. The officers were as
much interested in the event as the
men and the band of the flagship
played "See the Conquering Hero
Comes" as the winners passed the
stakeboat.
It was a wonderfully fast race. The
course was four miles long and the
winners covered it in 27 minutes 23
seconds and the losers in 2S minutes
flat. The tide was with the rowers,
but not to any great extent, as it was
nearly slack water. It was expected
that the men would be in an exhausted
condition after their effort, but instead
of that they were as fresh almost as
when they started, and each crew as
sisted in hauling Its boats into the
davits.
The race was the result of rivalry
that came into existence during the
recent boat drills. The first and sec
ond divisions of the lowa's crew are
berthed forward and the third and
fourth divisions aft. Talk led to a

Sergeant Duke and His Squad Make
a Grand Stand Play for the
Benefit of the Celes
tials.
Sergeant Duke and the Chinatown
squad made quite a record yesterday
afternoon. Promptly at 3 o'clock four
raids were made on as many lottery
places, or places supposed to be lottery
offices.
As the Oriental gentlemen -who have
charge of the various places saw the sÂ«t
time approach they put their houses. in
order and received the ununiformed police
with open arms and doors. Of course
they had not received any quiet tips re
garding the prospective raids, but their
Intuition or some other occult power hnd
informed them that trouble was impend
ing, and the result was that when the
squads arrived at 815 Dupont street, at
the Tai Loy office on Waverly place, at
the Fook Tal and the Chun Chun* Wing
on St. Louis alley, they were met by the
most innocent looking lot of Mongolians
that could be found in all Chinatown.
That nothing in the nature of evidence
against the places was found was not
the fault of the squads. They were look
ins for evidence, but, unfortunately for
the police, that intuitive power which
told the Chinese the exact hour at which
the raids were to be made also told them
that it would be well to get all "evidence"
out of the way and let the police make a
water haul.
While the raids accomplished nothing no
far as replenishing the treasury of the
city is concerned, they served to afford a
bit of innocent diversion for a number of
Chinamen who had evidently received !n
--formation that "something would be do
ing," for there was much "rubber-neck
ing" among the Celestials in the vicinity
of the places where the grandstand plays
were made, and from the grins or ap
preciation that appeared on the faces of
those who had evidf-ntly been Invited to
witness the fiasco it would appear that the
farce was well played.
HITE CASE ARGUMENTS.
Van R. Paterson Addresses the
Court Morning and Afternoon.
Arguments began in the Hlte case yes
terday morning before Judge Jones of
Colusa, pitting in Judge Hebbard's court
room. The entire day was consumed by
Van R. Paterson in the opening state
ment and he will talk all of this morning.
W. W. Foote will begin his argument
â  this afternoon. Attorney Hanlon closing
I for the plaintiff.
Quite a crowd gathered In the court
j room, anticipating something sensational,
; but disappointment was their only por
i tion. The attorneys did not Indulge in
verbose wars, nor did the only speaker of
the day refer to the many salacious inci
dents of the cam.
Attorney Paterson's argument re
ured a great deal of the testimony, par
ttcularly that which referred to the main
point of his case, the declared marriage
of Lucy, the Indian woman, to John R.
Hlte, the mining millionaire. Paterson
, claimed that the evidence showed that
I Hlte himself declared Lucy to be his wife;
I that she was known by general repute to
j be his wife and that they lived together
for several years. Many cases were cited
I regarding the solemnization of marriages,
and one, an alliance between an Indian
woman and a white man, was read at
length. Paterson claimed that the mar
riage of Lucy and John R. Hite
was solemnized according to the laws and
customs of the tribe, and such a marriage
was valid according to law, following the
| general legal maxim that a marriage
i good where entered into Is good the world
over.
The arguments will not be completed
until Wednesday.

COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE
An Agent Cannot Impose Upon an
Uninformed Foreigner.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment of the lower court In the action
! of Joseph La Marche against the New
I York Life Insurance Company. La
â  Marche is a foreigner and agreed with
' the agent of the company to tak,e out a
| policy, his understanding being that the
amount would be $10,000. Not being able
! to understand the English language he
j simply signed his name in the application,
and told the agent to fill out th? blanks.
When the' policy was returned from the
home office it was for only $3000 and Lv
! Marche refused to accept it. However,
1 he had given his note for the first pay
ment and the paper having passed into
third hands he was compelled to pay the
amount after suit. La Marche sued the
company to recover the amount, but suf
i fered a nonsuit in the lower court.
On appeal the insurance company ar
i gued that the wife being a benenciary
] should have been joined in th^ action
with the plaintiff; also that tho agent of
the company was the agent of L.i i
Marche, the latter having told him to fill
in the application blank. The Supreme
Court does not see the case in this light.
I It holds that the plaintiff did not accept
â¢ the policy and thus the wife was not a
; beneficiary; and further that the com-
I pany's agent was not the agent for La
I Marche, for he was not told to Insert in
I the form anything differing from the oral
I agreement.
LITTLE HELD TO ANSWER.
, A Jury Will Have to Decide Whether
He Used His Fist or a Club.
James Little, the rancher from San Jose
charged with assault with a deadly wea
pon upon Attorney W. A. Bowden of that
city, was yesterday held to answer before
' the Superior Court by Judge Mogan, in
i $IWO bonds. Bowden was attorney for
Little's wife in a suit for divorce, and se
cured a change of venue from Judge
Dalngerfleld, October 13, to Sacramento
County. After the parties left the court
room Little attacked Bowden, and, it was.
alleged, struck him on the head with
some dangerous instrument. Little as
serted that he only used his fist, but the
Judge thought a jury should decide upon
the question.
As Little had threatened to kill Bowden,
Attorney Chretien, who represented him,
asked the Judge for a warrant for Little's,
arrest on the charge of threats to kill,
: but on Little's promise that he would not
again molest Bowden Chretien consented
not to press for the warrant.

Philip Burke Arrested by Coroner
Hill Sentenced to Sir Months.
Philip Burke, a petty larceny thief, ap

to answer the charge of petty larceny for
stealing a buggy robe belonging to Coro
ner Hill last Friday. He wus chased by
the Coroner and one of his deputies, cap
tured and handed over to a policeman.
"I had a buggy robe stolen last Friday,"
said the Judge, "and I am inclined to be
lieve that you were the thief. Did you
steal the robe?"
Burke would neither affirm nor deny
that he was the man who stole the
Judge's property, although repeatedly
pressed to give a definite answer to the
question. The Judge convicted him of
stealing the Coroner's robe and sentenced
him to six months in the County Jail.

w,ere Bent away to an almost even
start. The third division boat had
about two feet the best of It and never
relinquished the advantage. Its boat
made much better weather of it and
eeemed to ride easier than the one In
which were the representatives of the
second division. For over a mile the
boats moved along like a team, but the
second division boat was taking the
back water of Its rival and it soon
began to tell. Inch by inch the third
division drew ahead until six lengths
separated the two boats. Then the
second division spurted and cut down
the lead, but It was of no avail; tho
third division boys held them safe and
won the race by 37 seconds.
There was a great difference in the
style of the two crews. The second
division men started off with a stroke
of from 38 to 40, and after the first
mile had been covered dropped to 36
strokes a minute. The third division
crew started with 34, but soon settled
down to 32, and held that speed to the
end. The men of the first and fourth
divisions are now going to have a
contest, and the winners of both
events will row for a trophy given by
the officers.

and worried over the loss of his wife.
Fred J. Darrell, a recent arrival from
Chicago, last night attempted to commit
suicide in the Olympic dance hall at 105 !
Grant avenue. Darrell, accompanied by I
a friend, was seated at a table engaged in
drinking a bottle of beer. Several women,
among whom was Katie Edington, were i
conversing with some of the patrons,
when they noticed Darrell take out a card
and write on it. After he had tinished I
scrawling a few lines he produced a vial j
of strychnine and started to pour the i
contents into the beer. The Kdington
woman, suspecting that he intended tv
drink the deadly potion, dashed the glass
out of his hand just as he had placed it
to his lips. He pretended that he was
only joking and to the woman claimed
that the poison was quinine. A few min
utes later he ordered another bottle of
beer and poured part of the contents into
his glass. While the woman's attention
was temporarily distracted Darrell emp
tied the contents of the vial into the glass
Before any one could interfere he drank
the poisonous draught. Police Officer Gei
man was quickly summoned, and on
learning that Darrell had taken poison he
had him conveyed to the Receiving Hos
pital. The doctors who attended him
say he will recover.
The message written by Darrell read as
follows:
:I To whom it may concern: If trouble
comes to this Englishman kindly triform
my esteemed friend F. S. Turton, Palace
Hotel."
To the doctors at the hospital Darrell
said that his wife had left him, and as he
had been unable to effect a reconciliation
he had determined to terminate his ex
istence. He bought the strychnine at a
Grant avenue pharmacy and intended
then to go to his room and end his exis
tence. Meeting a friend, he told him of
his troubles, and the latter, hoping to
cheer him up, induced him to visit the
dance hall where he swallowed the
strychnine. ,
To a reporter the would-be suicide said
his name was Floyd Norris. He, how
ever, admitted that he was frequently
known as Darrell. He said he was from
Plymouth, Devonshire. England, ana that
he left his home intending to visit Dawson
City in search of gold. On account of his
wife leaving him he had abandoned the
trip and resolved to die.

BORLAND WEDS
MINNA WOOD AT
REDWOOD CITY
Sequel to an Attempt
at Suicide.
STORY OF AN ANTIQUE GUN
ABSINTHE, A BULLET AND A
GAY BLONDE.
The Happy Couple Sacrifice Their
Honeymoon and Pledge Min
ister, Officers and Oarralous
Friends to Secrecy.
Guy H. Borland has supplied the tea
tables of the gossips with another de
licious morsel. The young man, it will be
remembered, occupied the public stage
for a few days in June because he shot
the contents of an antique derringer into
his abdomen. There always was a haze
of mystery around the affair, in which
floated the shadowy forms of the tender
loin and the golden hair of a dashing
blonde. Borland is now the loving hus
band of the blonde.
Every effort was made to keep the mar
riage a secret. Even the boon com
panions of the happy couple were left in
the outer darkness of ignorance. A week
ago Borland and the lady who is now his
wife went hurriedly to Redwood City,
where on October 24 they secured a mar
riage license. They were accompanied by
J. Connolly and a Aiiss Cunningham. Rev.
Mr. Martin of Redwood was summoned
and the nuptial knot was tied. The min
ister and County Clerk were cautioned
to preserve the greatest secrecy and the
bridal party returned to this city. As
yet they have not let their closest friends
into the secret, but somehow such things
escape and gossip tongues aTe already
quietly wagging.
Borland's love romance began several
months ago. While his marriage license
records the fact that he is 25 years of age,
ho acts and looks much younger. His
wife, the record reads, is Minna Wood,
aged 23 years. To a wide circle of friends
she has been known as Dorothy Woods,
a lady one would suspect to be some
what more than 23 years old. In the
early part of this year Borland's father,
who is resident representative for the
National Surety Company, went East on
business.
His son seized the opportunity to enjoy
a sweep through the tenderloin. His du
ties as rlerk to his father received little
more than a perfunctory attention and he
became one of the gayest of the small fish
in the famous district. He gave much of
his time to the blonde lady and for we^ks
managed to cut quite a figure. Then he
showed the very bad taste to take to ab
sinthe. On June 6 he entered his father's
office presumably to attend to his after
noon duties. He went into an inner of
fice and very quietly shot a bullet from a
derringer into his abdomen.
The report was not heard and young
Borland left the office unobserved. He
wandered around town for the afternoon
ami at 3 o'clock the next morning called
at an uptown sanitarium. He showed the
surgeon his wound and asked if it could
be fixed up. Results proved that it could
be and Borland dropped from public view.
Shortly .ifter he loft his father's ofhce
that afternoon the blonde lady called. She
evidently suspected something and after
being told that Guy was out she left and
did not return.
As soon as he recovered Borland re
sumed his wooing and the marriage of a
week ago was the result.
LEAVES THE OLD ROW.
The Burlington Route Opens Hand
some New Offices on Market
Street.
B\V. D. Sanborn, general agent of The
Burlington route, is at last in his new of
fices at 631 Market street under the Pal
ace Hotel after having been on Montgom
ery street for over twenty years.
There is as wide a difference in the ap
pearance of the new offices when contrast
ed with the old, as there is in the loca
tion of the two. The old offices were good
ones in their day, but they were of the
past while the new ones are not to be
surpassed by any railroad headquarters
on the street. All the desks, chairs, coun
ters settees and general furniture are of
quartered oak and have been constructed
in accordance with special designs of the

SUICIDE BY GAS.
A Young Waiter Unable to Secure
Employment Killed Himself.
Charles Blanco, a waiter, 24 years old, re
siding at 675 Mission street, committed
suicide last Sunday night by inhaling the
fumes of illuminating gas in his room.
He had closed the window and had
stopped up the keyhole, after writing a
note in pencil, reading as follows:
"To Whom It May Concern: Excuse me
for the trouble I will give you, but I can't
help it. I have tried and have failed to
?et work, and come to the conclusion that
may as well die as to bum around the
city doing nothing. I tried to get work In
the country, and spent $7.50 to go to Los
Angeles, and failed there and had to
spend $7.50 again to get back. It has
driven mo crazy.
"CHARLES BLANCO."
Coroner HUI will hold an Inquest to-day.
Dr. O'Donnell Will Win.
SineÂ© Dr. C. C. O'Donnell recovered
from his sickness he has succeeded In
turning the tide of public opinion In his
favor, and now his election to the office of
Coroner Is a certainty. The people realize
that Dr. O'Donnell's administration as
Coroner was the best we ever had In this
city. It is just that the founder of the
public Morgue should have the honor of
occupying the new Morgue building when
completed in January. â¢

ADMIRAL DEWEY
TO TAKR A BRIDE
Betrothed to Mrs. W. B.
Hazen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. â Admiral
Dewey announced to some of his more in
timate friends to-night the fact of his en
gagement to Mrs. W. B. Hazen of ihis
city. Mrs. Hazen Is the widow of General
Hazen, formerly chief signal officer of the
army, who died about ten years ago, and
is a sister of John R. McLean, Democratic
candidate for Governor of Ohio. Mrs.
Hazen has no children, and since her
husband's death has made her home with
her mother. She is a woman of large
means, about 40 years of age and popular
in the best society circles of Washington.
The date for the wedding has not been
fixed.
The news of the admiral's engagement
first became known to-night when the ad
miral announced the fact to a few of his
friends. Later in the evening he visited
the Lafayette-square Theater, and while
there also acknowledged the news to
some of his near friends and to Secretary
Long, who occupied one of the boxes.
While the date of the wedding is not
definitely known, the understanding is
that it will take place some time during
November.
Rumor has connected the names of the
admiral and Mrs. Hazen for some time,
but little attention was paid to the mat
ter It was at the house of Mrs. McLean,
the mother of Mrs. Hazen, that the ad
miral stopped when he came to Washing
ton after his return from Manila. Pre
vious to his departure to take charge of
the Asiatic squadron two 'ears age he
had been a visitor at the house.
The admiral's lirst wife died in ibtZ. She
was the daughter of a former Governor
of Vermont. One child from that mar
riage, a son. Is now living in New lork.
General Hazen, the former husband of
Mrs Hazen, died on the 16th of January,
1887, and a son from their union died last
Mrs Hazen has long been a social fa
vorite in Washington. She is possessed
of an attractive personality, of most
gracelul manners and has a brilliant
A. delegation of citizens of Tennessee
were among the first to learn of thÂ« ad
miral's engagement. Headed by Represen
tative Games of that State, they called
early in the evening to extend an invita
tion to the admiral to be present in Nash
ville on the occasion of the return home
of the First Tennessee Regiment from
Manila. Admiral Dewey urged the pres
sure of official duties, including the meet
ing- of the Philippine Commission, which
would prevent his accepting the invita
tion There were other matters, also, he
said, which intervened to prevent his
coming, and he finally admitted that he
had just secured the promise of Ms in
tended bride to become Mrs. Dewey.
The admiral was warmly congratulated
by the members of the delegation.
