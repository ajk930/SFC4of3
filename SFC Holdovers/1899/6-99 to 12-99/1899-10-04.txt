The contest was an end-on race â fif
' teen miles to leeward and a beat back
' against light winds. The Columbia,
starling forty-three seconds after the
Shamrock, rounded the mark two min
utt-s and one soct.nd ahead. The Sham
rock gained on the beat back, passed
â  the defender, and held the lead to the
tnd, althongh the Columbia was sain
. ing when the signal gun announced
that the time limit had expired.
â¢ Probably the largest flotilla of excur
. Eion boats and yachts on record fol
â  lowed the racers. It is estimated that
:' nearly two hundred and fifty vessels,
.carrying upward of 50.000 persc-ns, wit
â¢ raessed the contest at close range. But
.there was no interference with the
â race. Captain Robley D. Evans, with
.â¢ five revenue cutters and five torpedo
boats, policed the course admirably.
- Kis. work was high'.y praised both by
visiting and local sportsmen. He or
dered that Washington be notified of
â¢.three excursion steamships and one
yacht which were not dispÂ»>sed to kÂ«_-ep
. cut of the way. and will recommend
â¢ that the license of their masters and
pilot be suspended.
â¢ .'The betting on the cup races shifted
â¢to-nieht. Instead of odds of 10 to S on
the. Columbia even money ruled in
â  rrearly.all of the wagers that were laid.
"VVide" Interest was shown both ashore
and afloat in the reports of the race
Eent by Signer Marconi to the Herald
â ar.d The Call. The system of wireless
; telegraphy worked admirably, the news
. of the contest at every important point
' being , received in the Herald office
â within sixty seconds from the time it
â wa= flashed from the steamship Ponce,
otl which Signor Marconi conducted his
op-rations. About twenty-five hun
dre-1 words were sent from the Ponce,
and important stock quotations and
.the decision in the Venezuelan dispute
were received by those board the
â  Ponce as she followed the yachts along
the c;-jrs~. Srgror Marconi was cheered
frequently by the spectators.

By the Marconi system of wireless
telegraphy and the Herald-Call dis
patch boat came a message saying:
;VSay farewell, â ---. Â».o the
flagon of the Queen." Not yet. but for
a time near the ciose of to-day's ex
citing race .it looked that way. looked
all Shamrockâ looked as though the
Irish racer must inevitably beat her
American rival across the "finish line.
But before either could reach it the
time limit cut in and the race was off.
And everybody drew a long breath and
said: "'Who'd have thought it?" By
flukes and calms nd "Upton luck" the
emerald yacht came very nearly scor
ing- a victory over the Columbia. And
such a theory-upsetting, prediction
smashing victory that would have been.
For this race was run in "Columbia"
weather, with light winds and smooth
eea-s. which her adherents have wished
for and in which it was prophesied she
would show her heele to the Shamrock
from start to finish.
The race was an end-on tilt to an

I sea. The Shamrock had been described
as sluggish when going dead before a
light breeze, while 'on the other hand
; that had I -â¢â¢-:. reckoned as the Colum
j bia's best point of sailing.
But the race of to-day showed that
' the Shamrock, so far from being slug
f gish when running before a light wind,
' is an exceedingly nimble craft, and the
! best the Columbia could do with her
- during that long run down the wind
! was to round the mark two minutes
: one second ahead of her opponent.
In the opinion of ma: this failure
< to lead the Shamrock by a greater mar

In the beat back up the coast the ;
Shamrock seemed to be either better
handled than the Columbia or to have
much better luck. The wind was fluky
and from -:-.- inner In which the Co- j
lumbia consistently fcrmd all the soft ;
patches, it was argued, aid with appar
ent truth, that bad luck did not enter :
so much into the case as did bad man
agement. For luck, as a rule, does not :
run so much in streaks as did that wind
of jto-day. Time after time the Colum
bia was at a standstill, with headway
lost and sails idly flapping, while at the
same time the Shamrock was slipping:
along with sails rap full and pulling
hard. Nor could bad luck be blamed
for keeping the sails of the Columbia"
so pinched, so starved on that beat
back to the starting line that all the
life was taken out of the craft. And
this, too, against a lump}- head sea
which required wind power to drive a
yacht through.
But despite all the 111 luck and all the '
handicaps that were imposed upon her,
the Columbia showed her quality to the
satisfaction of all concerned. Experts
who witnessed the race declared em
phatically that she can outpoint and*
outfoot the Shamrock.
They pointed out that every time that
a chance was given the American yacht
â every time that a bit was loosened as
It wereâ she footed faster and pointed
higher than her opponent. She cer
tainly did have bad luck with wind,
notably at the close of the contest,
when she ran into a zone of idle
zephyrs which for fully five minutes
went shivering down one sail and up
another. And during this good time
the Shamrock, catching a breeze from
the northwest, went driving along at. a
clipping gait, widening her lead t-o
much that it looked as though it would
be impossible for the American yacht
to overtake her unless she made pur
suit in tow.
Then came the thrill. The Colum
' bia's a Iherentfl were astonish.cd by the

as that which was impelling the Co
lumbia, but despite all efforts of the
Irish yacht, despite her greater show
of canvas and great club topsail which
she was wearing, despite her weaker
gauge, despite everything, theHerres
hoff racer gained swiftly on the leader,
rapidly lessening the distance that
stretched between them. Thousands
looked at the performance incredulous
ly amazed. It seemed when the Colum
bia was becalmed that the Shamrock
had the race won, providing that sht
had time in which to finish it. That,
then, was the only doubt. But all that
was changed as soon as the Columbia
was favored with the same sort of wind
that the Shamrock held.
The Columbia's people took no more
chances at pinching their craft. In
stead they kept the sails a good rap
full and as a result the Columbia
footed so fast that it appeared that she
1 would either overtake the leader or
make a very close finish of it. The
thousands who witnessed this splendid
performance of the American yacht
held their breath as they saw the cup
defender overcoming the Shamrock's
lead, and many there were who, having
given ur> the race as lost, then be
lieved that the Columbia would still
beat her rival if time allowed. But it
did not. A full two miles away from
the finish line a gun boomed from the
yacht Corsair announcing to the racers
and to all concerned that the limit of
five and a half hours had expired and

THE CALL STILL AHEAD WITH WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
Was the First Paper in the World to Use the New System
for Gathering News.
TWO MINUTES â That is all that elapsed between the happenings of events In yesterday's big yacht race
and the time people were reading about them on The Call's bulletin boards, three thousand miles away from
where Marconi was ticking off the messages by wireless telegraphy. Over one hundred and fifty of these spe
cial bulletins were sent, each one of them describing some big change in the yacht race, and not one of them
had to be repeated because of inaccurracy.
SUCH A FEAT WAS NEVER BEFORE ACCOMPLISHED IN SENDING MESSAGES. SCIENTISTS
AND EXPERT TELEGRAPHERS ARE DISCUSSING IT AS THE BIGGEST WONDER SINCE MORSE
STARTED HIS SYSTEM.
This whole wonderful feat Us the outcome of The Call's original experiments in that line, with a view to
heralding before all others the approach of the California Volunteers from Manila. So successful were these
experiments that the New York Herald proposed to The Call to utilize them in reporting the big international
yacht race. Mr. "Marconi, the Inventor of wireless telegraphy, was accordingly Invited to America by The Call-
Herald to supervise the handling of the wireless telegraph reports of the race. The experiment was regarded
of such high scientific value by our Government that it detailed naval officers to accompany The Call-Herald spe
cial boat and report on the work with a view to adopting the system into the navy.
The immense success of the dispatches yesterday under. all the adverse conditions and the excitement of
an international yacht race has shown conclusively that wireless telegraphy is going to revolutionize the old
system of sending telegraph dispatches.
Mr. Marconi, from the steamer Ponce, sent his wireless messages to the Highlands. Some of these trav
eled fifteen miles through the air and consumed one minute of time to prepare them for transmission. Another
minute was consumed in sending the messages from the Highlands across the continent 3000 miles to The Call
business office i : v - Â£j
Those who read these bulletins may not know it, but they were witnesses of one of the greatest feats ever
done in telegraphy, and a feat that marks a new epoch in the history of sending dispatches.

in the habit of issuing orders to no ef- â¢
feet, if any such proof were needed. '
Captain Evans has already asked that ;
the license of offending capuajris be.
suspended.
The arrangement made by Captain j
Evans for the shielding of the yachts
from interference seemed to be as per- j
feet as any that could be conceived. All j
boats were kept clear of the starting
line and when the two yachts. jockey
ing for position, broke out their spin
nakers to the starting signal and swept
across the line with booms aswing. the j
course before them lay clear to the sea
line. Back of it the excursion fleet was.
scattered over a vast area and appar
ently in inextricabie confusion. Here
and there the long lean hulls of the
torpedo flotilla were seen, and near by
were the yellow painted cutters of th*
revenue marine service. To the layman
It all seemed a mighty maze, and one
without a plan. But hardly had the :
yachts crossed the line before the great
fleet took definite shape. Torpedo boats
under Lieutenant Commander John C.
Fremont on his flagship, the Porter, the
boat he commanded during the war
with Spain, led the line to the west
ward, keeping all the excursion craft
on the starboard hand.
Led by the flagship the revenue cut- ''
ters took the other side of the line and
kept all seaward craft from approach- j
ing the contesting yachts. The racers, !
therefore, had a clear course before
them and an unobstructed wind be
hind, and with two fleets of excursion
craft on either side, but not near i
enough to in any way interfere with
either. On the beat back the same pre- !
caution was taken to see that neither
of the yachts was in any way ob
structed. But despite the distance from j
which they were kept from the course
none of the excursionists can complain
of not having had a fair sight of the I
contest. Stretched out in long lines
their view was as unobstructed as was :
the course of the racing yachts.
The weather was as fine as any ex- j
cursionist could ask, and those who
did not go afloat to-day missed a spirit
ed yachting picture under clouds which
looked as though they had been painted
for the day and purpose.
Flags snapped gaily to the lash of the
morning, wind ami everywhere was
brightness, light and animation. That
v.-as in the early forenoon, when the
wind held out a promise of being a fair j
Shamrock day, a day of "wet sheets I
and flowing seas," instead of light and
fiuky airs with which it closed.
The excursion fleet was a motley
group. Through the whole gamut of
marine construction it ran, from the j
stately ocean-going steamship and its j
exclusive patrons to the sloppy little j
tug with its catch-as-catch-can patron
age of whatever came its way. Scores J
of craft unfamiliar to these waters,]
alien vessels brought here for Dewey j
parade purposes and remaining over for J
whatever harvest might be reaped from j
the yacht races, were in line, as was
the local fleet, an intact and jealous i
squadron, whose owners and charter- |
ers looked askance at strange keels and j
held mightily that there were some j
yacht race rights and privileges which
outsiders ought to respect.
As to the crowds the vessels carried,
it is to be hoped that no one's feelings
will be hurt when it is said that the
spectators were themselves a spectacle.
They were there because of the yachts,
but had these racing machines been j
swallowed up by the sea or melted into j
vapor the excursion crowd would still
have been a sight well worth a second
look and well worth taking excursion
chances to see. - There was nothing j
little about it. nothing at least so far \
as numbers went. The yachting en
thusiast, with his uncles and his cous- j
ins and his aunts, was there and deeply
interested they all were in the outcome j
of that struggle for the cup.
And many other enthusiasts â those j
who cannot distinguish a fin keel from j
a spinnaker boom â were there besides, j
these mainly distinguishable by that ;
riot-provoking style of headgear which
those who follow yachting by reading
about it so much affect. All were ex
uberant, and if any missed enjoyment

signifying that the course would be
south southwest. Ten minutes later
the Shamrock's crew rigged their spin
naker boom out to port, all ready to
set that sail.
Promptly at 11 o'clock the prepara
tory signal â a blue peter â was set on
board the committee boat, and two red
balls hoisted on the triatic stay. At the
same time a tug started to lead off the
course of fifteen miles to leeward. Dur

topsail about the same time.
At one minute before the start the
--: was approaching the line
from the eastward and the Colombia
from the westward. When thirty sec
onds were left the Shamrock, which had
been coming for the line with boom to
port, gybed to starl . ; ..-â¢ as the Co
lumbia, with boom to port, rounded the
west end of the line and began easing.
Captain Hogarth, however, had his boat
several lengths in the lead, and just as
the signal was given he gybed the
Shamrock again, crossing the line thir
ty-seven seconds after the signal.

At 12:15 the wind shifted to the
northwest. The Columbia, being in

lin the spinnaker shortly. Captain
i Barr gybed her to port, trimmed down
: staysail and balloon jib topsail sheets,
| and in just five minutes the Columbia
I had walked past the Shamrock and was
; the leading boat. Captain Hogarth
; gybed the Shamrock, after taking in
the spinnaker, at 12:16. Th- set her
: spinnaker to starboard at 12:30, but
only for five minutes. Captain Ho
\ garth, finding he was losing time, took
the sail in smartly and luffed the green
sloop across the Columbia's wake,
â¢: taking a position on the starboard
quarter.
The outer mark was obscured by a
haze, bo that it was hot visible from
the. yachts until 1 p. m. That did not
matter much to either Captain Ho
garth or Captain Barr?" for they were
indulging in a luffing ami close in on
the Jersey beach for more than half an
hour. Finally Captain Barr. having
the Columbia well ahead, eased sheets
and kept off for the mark at 1:05,
crossing the Shamrock's bow one
eighth of a mile ahead. At 1:17 he set
the spinnaker on the Columbia to star

mark at perhaps not more than a six

balloon jil tops rtly, and as they
. ;ed the rr.ark. a float bearing a red
, ball with a white stripe, which had to
be left on the starboard hand, the big
main boom swung over to port, all
sheets were trimmed flat on the star

The time taken at the outer mark ia

So it will be seen by the official fig

minutes forty-four seconds. Her elaps

Captain Barr kept the Columbia on
the inshore tack for two minutes forty
five seconds after rounding the mark
when he let her come about to the port
tack, setting the baby jib topsail as
she filled away. In twenty seconds he
swung her about again. The Sham

could have crossed the Columbia's bow.

.'the wind died out again, the Shamrock
â¢ continuing to hold a breeze, and by 3:35
: she was early half a mile to windward
â¢â¢of the Bristol boat. There was a strong
â¢ tide setting to the southwest which
â seemed to affect the Columbia more
.than it did the Shamrock. As it was
â¢ necessary, according to the rules, to
finish the race before 4:45, it soon be
came evident, as the boats at 4 o'clock
: w("-re some five miles to leeward of the
finish, that the race would have to be
declared off. This was done at the time
r.amed, while the boats were still four
miles away from the finish.
vlt was very evident from to-day's
performance of the Shamrock that she
is indeed a very fast yacht. That she is
speedy in light winds was shown by her
..work the first half of the first leg of the
â¢course; that she is quick in stays was
.amply proven by her windward work,
and it is also a fact that she stands up
to her canvas equally well with the Co
lumbia. In the matter of handling
.'sails there was little to choose between
â .the two, and if any mistakes were
made it was more the fault of the fluky
â¢ -.breezes than of the judgment of the
' sailing masters. Some idea of the wind
ward work of these two yachts may be
gathered from the fact that in the
â  twelve miles sailed from the outer mark
.to where the race was concluded the
.Columbia made twenty-five tacks and
the Shamrock twenty-three.

â  result of the race between the Sham
rock and Columbia for the America
.cup. The culminating point was
reached -da'- when the center of the
newspaper world <â : Great [tain was
literally packed with a hu?e multitude
â of cheerine and enthusiastic partisans.
It is calculated that at 10:30 some
thing like 20.000 people were within the
area between Fleet street and the

possible. The police authorities were
completely taken by surprise and no
provision had been made for dealing
with the vast crowds that thronged
Fleet street and the adjacent thorough
fares from St. Paul's to the Piccadilly
Circus.
At midnight the main arteries were
thronged with people excitedly discuss

MARVELOUS
WORK OF WIRELESS
TELEGRAPHY
NEW YORK. Oct. 3 â Marconi's worl^ roore than met expectations. During
the race 2500 words in bulletin service were sent to the Herald and received
without loss of tirt)e. &n average of less than a minute elapsed between the
writing of a bulletin and its receipt in the rjerald office. Not one roessage had
to be repeated.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â Far and
away the greatest achievement
connected with the yacht race
of to-day was the successful
operation of the Marconi sys
tem of wireless telegraphy, by means
i>f which every movement of the com
peting craft was bulletined to the
Herald and The Call as noon as it
occurred. Did either break out a sail
that fact was given to the readers of
the Marconi bulletins before the fresh
canvas had been filled with wind. In
short, the system worked to perfection.

launch his discovery on the world as an >
accomplished news agency. The story of
the preparations made at the eastern
end of the continent have bees told in
full. It only remained for this paper to
take advantage at this end of the pre
parations at the other. How well that
was done was attested by the crowds that
gathered early yesterday morning In front
of The Call business office to watch the
start, the progress and the finish of the
race, upon the result of which two worlds
are hang-ing breathless.
Xo similar successful attempt at pictur
ing and describing a passing event has
ever been recorded in Journalism. The
apparatus was not particularly elaborate,
but It was so perfect, that â¢ those who
witnessed its workings needed nothing
but the power to take out of their con
siderations the. three thousand odd miles
that separated them from the Jersey
coast to imagine they were witnessing the
actual struggle. Across the main arch
of the building was stretched a canvas
forty feet long by eight feet high, on
which had been painted that part of the
ocean over which had been laid out the
cup course and the coasts bounding It.
In front of this picture, hanging by
endless cords, were suspended miniatures
of the contending yachts, so arranged as
to be carried over the course as the bul
letins to be received should indicate the
challenger and defender were moving. In
addition to this a large stretch of white
muslin had been arranged on rollers on
the side of the building upon which the
bulletins were to be painted as fast as
received in order that those not up In
the. maneuvers might be fully informed
of the progress of the race.
Eleven o'clock, New York time, 8 o'clock
in San Francisco, was the hour set for
the start: As early as 7 o'clock, however,
The Call's yachting expert and his as- i
steamship Ponce, and In not a single ,
I instance did it become necessary to re- I
peat a message. Not only did Slgnor
Marconi make it possible for the pub
, lie ashore to closely follow the maneu
! vers of the Columbia and Shamrock, j
but he kept tho?e who had the good
fortune to be on the steamship Ponce j
â  -well informed on the more important i
j events of the day in the world at large. I
: For the benefit of several gentlemen j
i having Wall street interests early
stock quotations were received, and the i
i money market was closely followed.
As the yachts got away the follow
ing: message, the first concerning the ;
; actual race, was written, and in less I
sip tent
wrrp on tiock awaiting the signal
to manipulate the miniatures, and the
crowd began to gather. At 8 o'clock the
street was packed with a multitude that
was not alow to manifest its disapproval
of the slowness of the Eastern racing
officials in giving the signal for the start.
The Call skippers could be seen giving
jerks at the cords preliminary to the
opening of the event.
At 8:05 a. m. the first bulletin was dis
played on the muslin. It read: "The wind
is northwest and blowing eleven knots an
hour, ' which was readily taken by the
crowd to predicate that "Upton luck"
was on the decline and that the Colum
bia was a winner. Seven minutes later
another bulletin announced the start and
The Call skippers trimmed their sails ac
cordingly, the little boats starting out on
the sea of canvas. The Shamrock was
slightly In the lead, the next bulletin an
nouncing that she had crossed the line at
11:15:35, the Columbia following five sec
onds later. -
"They're off:" yelled the crowd, The
Call skippers pulled the cords and the
challenger and defender were soon run
ning before the wind, which had died
down, the next bulletin announced, to
eight knots. For the next five hours and
a half the crowds stood and grew and
watched The Call's miniature yachts
struggle for the supremacy on the canvas
sea. During: thht period' more than 150
bulletins were borno along Maromian
waves to a through land wire and fiashfd
through to The Call office. Every foot of
the course, every movement of the racers
was noted and "wired" for the Informa
tion of the hundred? and hundreds of peo
ple crowding In front of The Call bulle
tins. Every taking in or crowding on of
Fall was noted, every movement of the
wind, every tack was recorded by the bul- .
than ninety seconds was published and
public property in New York:
"Racers away; both yachts flying
mainsail, club topsails, spinnakers,
staysails, Jib and jib topsails. Running
before â¢wind down the Jersey coast.
Wind about eight knots and freshen
ing."
Following this were bulletins giving
more accurate descriptions of the work
being done, and there was joy on the
Ponce when word came back that
everything was working so perfectly
that only a very few seconds separated
the chart room within which the send
ing was being done and the offices of
the Herald and The Call. During those
early moments of the race, when favor
letins of wireless! v jut a
hitch. f
The waiting crowds were all eyes. Bul
letins or a Presidential election could not
have aftracted more attention than those
that recorded the spilling of wind ur the
Happing of a sail, is'or an the time of the
race the street in front of ThÂ« Call busi
ness ortice was a solid jam of humanity,
with the exception of one thick-). â 
policeman, who seemed to be entirely ig
norant of the meaning of tha^L word. He
was officious to the point' of insult, push
ing and hauling people ui>Â»ut without jus
tincation, for all of which there is the
consolation that he will probably have a
chance to answer to his olheial superiors.
At one other newspaper office a. feeble
attempt was made to draw a crowd, but
it was too weak, it lacked all the ele
ments of realism. Small boats were
chased along a narrow cornice of blue
canvas regardless of the positions of thÂ£
racers and in imminent danger of tacking
into a yellow porthole or jibing 1 into the
nearest office window. It was a clear test
of the wired against the wireless tele
graph, and the Journalism that is in the
sere and yellow was plainly wired. Early
in the race it gave up attempts at fur
nishing bulletins for the very good reason
that n received none and the skippers in
a tire-escape to the sou'-sou'east got tir<<i
of chasing to The Call board tor their
facts.
I'uring the entire course of the race,
from the Hrinp of the signal gun until the
posting of the bulletin that announced
"n<> race" the arrangements made by this
paper worked to perfection. The elements
all were favorable, not to speak of the
gentle breeze wafting down Market street
to fill out the sails of the mimic yachts
in fair imitatir.n of the swelling canvas of
the actual racers. The excitement at all
times was intense, particularly in the first
stages of the race, when the Shamrock
seemed to be getting the better of the Co
lumbia. There were groans of disap
proval when the hulk-tins announced that
the excursion boats were shutting off the
Columbia s breeze. It was plain, before all
eyes thai both boat* had Balling qualities

the Columbia showed her heHs to the.

lenger while the cup defender was
floundering a bit uncertain in the
smooth sea, every breeze was described.
The fifth bulletin read thus: "Sham
rock apparently leading slightly. Buth
balloon jibs spilling wind, but Sham
rock's sail is drawing the better. Course
clear."
It required one minute and a quarter
to send this dispatch, yet the first three
wurds, "Shamrock apparently leading,"
were received in New York and given
out as a separate bulletin before the
last word, "clear," was sent.
Whenever the Marconi bulletins were
posted the public was less than seven
ty-five seconds behind the yachts, and
In many cases less than thirty seconds.
By unofficial time the Columbia
rounded the first mark at I:4S and the
Shamrock followed at 1:40:15. The time
of the Columbia had been flashed all
over New York before the Shamrock
had followed.
Aboard the Ponce there was the keen
est apprehension of the work being
done. Indeed, it is not too much to say
that, except at the most critical mo
ments during the race, more attention
was given to the mysterious chart room
and to Signor Marconi than to the
yachts. Aboard the other excursion
steamers, too, the passengers were
deeply interested in the wireless re
ports. Almost without exception the
Ponce was saluted by a round of cheers
from every boat it met during the day.
Signor Marconi was compelled to shut
himself off from the curious, whose
good-natured attentions hindered the
work to be accomplished.
In consequence, until after the race
had been called off the chart room of
the Ponce was closed, except to Signor
Marconi and his assistants, the report
ers for the Herald and The Call, and
the representatives of the Government,
who were present In an unofficial ca
pacitf to watch the results accom
plished by the new system. These gen
tlemen were: Lieutenant Commander
Qualtrough and Lieutenant Blish, rep
resenting the navy, and Captain L. W.
Wildman and Colonel Kinsley nf the
signal service department. Mr. Kinsley
is a civilian, but has given much at
tention to the wireless telegraph, and
was engaged to study and report upon
Signor Marconi's achievements. He
was more than pleased with the work
of the day, and at its close, when asked
for an expression of his opinion, said:
"My first report must be made to
Captain Squier, but there can be only
;>inion when It is known that 2500
words in bulletins were sent ashore and
the total could have, been greatly in
creased, and all of this was done "with
out any vexatious delay or repetition."
Lieutenant Commander Qualtrough
was more outspoken. He became an
enthusiast early in the day, and be
fore nightfall was declaring his be
lief that the United States Govern
ment would do well to persuade Sig
nor Marconi to install his system in
the Philippines at the earliest date.
"If we could only have had this
last year," said Lieutenant Com
mander Qualtrough, "what a great
thing it would have been. When we
landed marines at Guantanamo the
ships were unable to lend assistance
for the reason that the enemy could
not be located, and by firing at ran
dom our own forces would have been
placed in danger. With the aid of
the Marconi system the men ashore
could have directed the fire and all
would have been well.
"The English are prepared now to
do just what I have outlined. They
send a Marconi apparatus ashore with
a landing party and communication
with the ship is never lost. In the
Philippines the system would right
now be of great service to us. It
would do away with wires, which are
easily cut, and it would enable us to

Even if to-day's record could not be

the possibilities of his discovery."
Before the end of the contest a few
private messages were accepted by
Signor Marconi for delivery ashore but
after the battle the final bulletin to the
Herald and The Call announcing "No
race" had been filed, there was a rush
for the chart room and the good-na

Continued on Fourth Pay*.ADMIRAL DEWEY PRESENTED
WITH THE SWORD OF HONOR
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2.â The
culmination of Admiral
Dewey's triumphal home
coming was reached to-day in
the shadow of the dome of the
National Capitol. Here he received
from the hands of the President the
magnificent jeweled sword voted by
Congress ir. commemoration of the vic
tory of Manila Bay. This was the offl
c.'a! reason for the the ceremony. But
mere official sanction could never have
thrown into the demonstration the fer
vor of enthusiasm that was meted out
to the admiral as he appeared bsfore
the vast audience, composed not only
of all the highest ofliciais In the .and,
but of spectators drawn from every
quarter of the United States. The bat
tle of Manila Bay was not forgotten,
but It might be said to have beer rele
gate-I almost to second place in the
desire to do honor to the man who had
proved himself as great after victory
as before it and who had shown in the
long and trying- months that followed
his triumph the qualities cf a states
man and a wise administrator a^ well
as those of the fighting leader of a vic
torious neet.
Ar.d enhancing these qualities was
that of manly modesty, displayed In the
4Uiet dignity with which he met the
occasion. This trait of Dewey's char
acter was in evidence from the moment
he reached the stand side by side with
the Piesident. He paused at this point
point for a moment, unwilling, appar
ent! y. to take the place that had been
prepared for him on the right of the
platform. lest he should appear to
usurp the place due to the chief magis
trate. President McKlniey grasped" the
situation in an instant and, taking the
great sea captain by the arm. placed
him by gentle force in the chair that
had beeii intended for him. Later in
the cay. as the carriage bearing the
official party drove away from the
Capitol oetween walls of cheering peo
ple, the President again displayed his
tact by remaining covered and ignoring
the demonstration himself, leaving its
acknowledgment to the admiral.
For Dewey it was a trying as well as
a triumphal day. It had been given to
few officers in the naval history or" the
country to sit before a crowd uf thou
sands while tha chief of the naval es
tablishment dilated on their exploits.
And then to stand before the same
crowd to receive at the hands or the
President a sword prepared for him a:
the behest of the representatives of the
v. hole people. The strain upon Admiral
Dewey reached almost to the breaking
point. None but those nearest to him
could see how he labored to repress his
feehr.ss during the address of Secre
tary Lor.ir. but when he arose to receive
the* sword from the hands of the Presi
dent no or.c could mistake the ilash of
the white-gloved hand as it rose to
dash away the tears before the admiral
came to the rieid attitude of attention
before his chief?
When it came Dewey's turn to re
ply h;s voice failed him and he made
the effort twice before his lips would
respond. When he did succeed his tones
â were oirar ar.d steady, but so low that
only those nearest him could hear.
There was an exquisite comedy fol
lowing the trying formalities, though it
escaped all but those directly on the
Ftaud. As the admiral closed and took
his seat he turned to the President and
In a tone of quizzical appeal inquired:
"Now, really, don't you think I did
pretty well for an amateur?"
Once during the ceremonies Secretary
Long "embraced an opportunity to ease
the trying situation for the chief actor
in the" day's events. When the Secre
tary- began his address the sun was
shining directly in the admiral's eyes,
and without his hat he was at its
mercy. The Secretary quietly inserted
in his address a low aside. "Admiral,
turn your chair a little; we don't want
to have you blind."
One of the most remarkable features
cf the eventful day was the ovation to
Rear Admiral Schley on the return of
the party from the Capitol to the White
House. His carriage was several num
bers behind that of the President and
Admiral Dewey, and received an ova
tidrj that scarcely ranked below that
accorded to the admiral himself. The
tumult grew as the carriage paced
down the avenue and the crowd surged
aroun'i It until the horses were brought
to a foot pace. Finally a company of
the Hig-h School Cadets came to the
rescue ar.d formed about the carriage
in a hollow square. Thus protected and
ranked by a force of police, the car
riage reached the White House with a
long gap between it and the next offi
cial guests.

The scene of the presentation was
most ...... located under the
shadow of the great Capitol of the na- ;
tion â a spot filled with memories of
other stately ceremonies.
The escort which marched in line j
with the admiral was ma up entirely
of soldiers and sailors. There was
nothing in the general arrangements a.* ;
the immerse crowd swept through the
beautiful plaza to indicate that the oc
casion was anything less than a Presi
dential Inauguration. From the flag
decorated stand the crowd below pre- !
sented the picture of an immense field
of faces turned up toward the shining
white pile of the Capitol. Seats were â¢
provided on the grand stand stretching
between the buttresses of the east por
tico. Here it was that the most bril
liant coloring was laid on the great liv
ing picture as the gold and blue of mili
tary uniforms and the brighter garb of
the diplomatic corps drifted in. Then
came the solid mass of the naval offi
cials.
The start from Mr. McLean's resi
dence was made promptly at 10 o'clock.
Admiral Dewey had breakfasted at 3:10
with his son ar.d Lieutenants Brumby
and CaldwelL He emerged from the
house with Chairman Moses of the lo

and gold lace, the gre-at throng that
had assembled in the adjacent streets
and Farragut square broke out into a
long and loud cheer of applause.

marine band, the admiral was driven to

crowds His progress was slow and he

Perry ended by introducing Secretary
Long, who was received with enthu
siasm, and, standing bareheaded, ad
dressed his remarks directly to Dewey,
who remained bareheaded and seated.
Secretary Long spoke as follows:
My Dear Admiral: Let me read a few
extracts from our official . -â -, '.'-nee,
covering less than a fortnight's time, and
cow known the world over:
"WASHINGTON. April 24. IS9S.â Dewey,

tion for further promotion."
In those few words what a volume of '
history; what a record of swift, high,
heroic discharge of duty. You went, you
saw, you conquered. It seems but yester
day that the republic, full of anxiety.

Let me now read the act of Congress in
I pursuance of whirh we are here.
"Resolved. By the Senate and House of
! R<*r>r*<srntativ^s of the United States nf ]
America; in Cnngr*<=s assembled, that thÂ» \
Secretary of the Navy be and he hereby
is authorized to present a sword of honor
of Commodore George I Â»ewey. and to

mand of Commodore Georgo Dewy on
May 1. ISC-v and that, to enable the Secle
tary to carry out this resolution, the sum
of JIOjQOO. or so much thereof as may be
necessary, is hereby appropriated.
"Approved June 3. IS9S.'"
It was by this solemn enactment, ap
proved by the President, that the people
of the United States made provision for
putting in mat-rial form one expression
of their appreciation of your valor as an
officer of their navy and of your great
achievement as their representative in
oper'ng- trÂ« doo* to a new era in the dv
iiimtion of the world.
The victory at Manila Bay ?ave you
rnr.k ... most distinguished naval
heroes of all tinr's. Nor was your merit
most in the brilliant victory which you
achieved In a battle fought "with the "ut
most gallantry and skill, waged without
error and crowned with overwhelming
success. It was still more in the nerve
with which you sailed from Hongkong
to Manila harbor: tn the spirit of your
conc^n'tion of attack: in your high com
manding confidence as a leader who had
weighed every risk and prepared for
every emergency, and who also had that
unfaltering determination to win and that
utter freedom from the thought of pr.s=i
billty of swerving- from his purpose which
are the very assurance of a victory- No
captain ever faced a more crucial â¢ st
thnr. when that morning bearing the fate
and the honor of your country- In your
hand, thousands of miles from home, with
every foreign port in the world shut to
you: nothing between you and annihila
tion but the thin sheathing of your ship?,
your cannon and your devoted officers and
men. you moved upon the en^my 1 ? bat
teries on shore and on sea with unflinch
ing: faith and rerve. and 'before the sun
was half way up in the heaven? had si
lenced the guns of the foe. sunk the hos
tile fleet, demonstrated the supremacy of
the American sea power and transferred
to the United States an empire of the
islands of the Pacific. Later, by your
display of large powers of administration,
by your poise end prudence and by your
great discretion, not only in act. butaiso
In word, which is almost more important,
you proved yourself a sreat representa
tive citizen of the United States, as well
as its great naval hero.
The luster of the American navy was
gloriously bright before, and you have
added to It a new luster. Its constellation
cf stars was giorious before and you have
added to ft another star of the first mag
nitude. And yet many of your grateful
countrymen feel that, in the "time to come,
it may be your still greater honor that
you struck the first blew under the prov
idence of God In the enfranchisement of
those beautiful island? which make the
great empire of the sea; in relieving
them from the bondage and oppression of
centuries and in putting them on their
way. under the protecting shield of your
country's guidance, to take their place in
the civilization; the arts, thÂ» industries,
the liberties and all the good things of
the most enlightened and happy nations
of the world, so that generations hence
your name shall be to the] a household
word, enshrined in their history and in
their heart*. Clouds and darkness may
llneer about them now. hut the shining
outcome is as sure as the rising of the
sun. Whatever the passing tribulations
and difficulties of the present moment,
they will, in due time, soon and surely
give way to the dawn of a glorious new
day â the day not of any mere selfish im
perial dominion of one peoD'.e over an
other, but of the Imperial moral and
physical growth and expansion of all the
peoples, whatever their race or language
or color, who hnvo come under the shelter
of the broad shield of the United States
of America.
By authorising the presentation of this
sword to you as a mark of its approval,
your country ha? recognized therefore not
only the great rich fruits which, even be
fore returning from your victory, you
have poured into her lap. but a!so her own
responsibility to discharge the grea! trust
which is thus put upon her and fulfill the
destiny of her own growth and of the em
pire that is now her charge. It Is a new
demand upon all the resources of her con
science, wisdom and courage. It is a work
In the speedy and beneficent consumma
tion of which she is entitled to the cordial
help, sympathy and uplift of all her
citizens, no: the faint-hearted doubts and
teasing cavils of any of them. It is â¢
work on which she has entered in the in
terest of early peace in these new land?
their stable government, the establish
ment in th^m of law and order, the se
curity of life and property and the Ameri
can standards of prosperity :ind home
Let those who fear remember that though
her children, guided by you. took the
wings of the morning and dwelt in the
uttermost parts of the sea. even there
her hand shall hold them. In this work
in view of the great part you have taken
in the sudden development of her sov
ereignty, your â  full knowledge of the
situation and the just hold you have on
the hearts of all her people, she looks for
your continued service and listens for
your counsel in the high hope and pur-
E' ose that the triumph of her peace shall
c even greater than her triumph in war.
It is my good fortune, under the terms
of the enactment of Congress, to have the
honor of presenting to you this beautiful
sword. If during the coming years, which
I trust will be yours, of useful service to
your country, it shall remain sheathed in
peace, as God grant it may. that fact will
perhaps be due more than to anything
to thÂ« thoroughness with which you have
already done its work. I congratulate you
on your return acros the sea in full health
of mind and body to receive it here, here
in the National Capitol, here on these con
secrated steps where Lincoln stood, here
etandinc between the statue of the first
President of the United States and him
who is its living President to-day, here in
this beautiful city adorned with the stat
ues of its statesmen and heroes, the num
ber Incomplete until your own is added.
here amid this throng of citizens who are
only a type of the millions and millions
more who are all animated by the same
spirit of affectionate and grateful wel
come. I cannot doubt that this is one of
the proudest days of your life, and I know
it is one of the happiest in the heart of
each one of your fellow countrymen
wherever they are, whether on the conti
nent or on the far-off islands of the sea.
Now. following the authorization of
Congress, I present this sword of honor
which I r.old In my handâ my hand!
rather let It go to you through the hand
of one who In. his youth also periled his
life and fought for his country in battle,
and who to-day is commander-in
of all our armies and navies, thÂ© Presi
dent of the United States.
As Secretary- Long concluded, he
passed the sword to President McKin
ley. The latter rose and faced the ad
miral. Dewey was visibly affected, and
brushed his gloved hands across his
eyes before standing at attention. The
President said:
Admiral Dewey: Prom your entrance
into the harbor of New York with your
gallant crew and valiant ship the demon
strations which have where greeted
you reveal the public esteem of your
heroic action and the fullness of love in
which you are held by your country.
The voice of the nation is lifted in praise
and gratitude for the distinguished and
memorable services you have rendered the
country, and all the people give you an
affectionate welcome home, in which I
join with all my heart.
Your victory exalted American valor
and extended American authority. There
was no rlaw in your victory; there will be
no faltering in maintaining it. iGreat ap

The admiral and the President then
seated themselves and conversed ani
; matedly. The former was facing south,
and he noticed a little girl, probably
four years old. in the crowd near the
stand kissinp her hand to him. In an
| instant his face was aglow and he
i waved both hands to the young one.
I There was some delay in the starting
j of the escort, and during the interval
the admiral and the President were
: joined on the stand by Secretary Long,
j Secretary Hay, Secretary Hitchcock,
I Attorney General Griggs, Postmaster
General Smith. Secretary Root and ex-
Secretary Alger.
The Olympia's men. who had been
placed at points of vantage, whence
I they could see their chief honored, first
I marched across the plaza to take th-Â»
I place of honor at the right of the line,
and were greeted with continuous
cheering. When they fell into place the
review began. General Miles and his
j staff riding by in salute and then
I taking up a position on the plaza north
of the stand. Admiral Dewey, the
i President and the others in the party
j remained standing during the passing
|of the troops. The admiral touched
; his chapeau to each organization and
removed it in salutation of every flag.
He clapped his hands when the Dis
trict National Guard came into view,
j and the guards were also given ap
; plause by the throngs. In the rear of,
i the Olympia'B men marched detach
ments from the Machias, the Marietta
and the lowa, and the famous black
goat, which is the lowa's mascot,
trotted along with the jackies with
most amusing impertinence. The re
i viewing party evidently enjoyed this
feature. The ; mpia's men got a
splendid send-off from every- one. th*
â  citizens in the mounted escort giving
them three cheers and waving their
hats as the men behind the guns
passed by.
When the review was concluded the
admiral and President McKinley en
tered the latter's carriage. The Cabi
net officers and members of the com
mittee entered other carriages. When
: Admiral Schley, -who was well down
the list, entered his carriage he was
given a demonstration which continued
all through the Capitol grounds, and he
| was compelled to rise in his carriage
; and bow his acknowledgments of the
warm greeting given him.

Admiral Dewey came at 8 o'clock, and
; as he passed inside with Flag Lieutenant

'â â¢ admiral was enthusiastically cheered.
' Hear Admiral Sen ley was given a similar

presented a paper signed by ten of the

Asr.lnaldo desired to end the war and
send a civil commission for conference,
ar.d were informed that it would not be
received. They will be sent beyond the

JUNEAU, Alaska. Sept. 30 (via Seat

ent earthquakes on Alaksn
ra is most d< plorabte from a
at of view.

Johi: Davies of Juneau, â who owns a
custom stamp mill, as well as the little
steams Thistle, took an adventurous
Ishman, who wanted to see ice and
plenty of it. up the Taku the other day.
It was the first time any one had at
tempted the trip since the earthquake
inday, September 10. It was seen
that the Foster glacier has slid off down
nearly t< a leyel with the surface of the
water â that is, from the sea level the
glacier runs back at a gentle, rugged
inclineâ the fine, transparent altitudes
of ioe having slid and crashed Into the
rea.
The Englishman thought he saw
more Ice than he probably ever will
again in the course of his natural life.
What happened the glaciers in Dis
enchantment Bay, near Takutat, has

Nov.- the question is, what has hap

it alone of all the principal glaciers In
Alaska have escaped without Injury'?
People hereabouts do not think so.
â vThat makes the uncertainty worse Is
that it Is highly Improbable that there
be any way to find out before the
first tourist ship reaches thÂ°re next sea
son. There are no Indians in the vl
cir.ity, and even If there were this is
the wrong time of the year for them to

MINERS WATCH
BIG DREDGERS
Interesting Day Spent
at Orovilie.
Special D'.ewttch to The CaiL
OROVILLE, Oct. 3.â The mining en
gineers' party experienced to-day in
and around Oroville one of the most
delightful days of its trip. After an
early breakfast on the train, which ar
rived during- the night, the visitors dis
covered close to the depot a feature of
California mining which delighted
them more than have some big quartz
mines. Close to the depot some Chi
nese were mining bedrock gravel
through a small shaft and working it
in. a primitive rocker.
Twenty carriages soon speeded the
party down the Feather River to visit
gold dredgers, six of which are oper
ating along a stretch of six miles of the
river banks. All the dredgers of dif
ferent type were visited and the pon
derous machinery and gold-saving de
vices were closely studied. They saw
great machines costing $35,000 each
which will handle 2000 cubic yards of
gravel a day at a cost of from 3 to 7
cents a yard, and learned that around
Oroville alone are many square miles
of deep gravel beds yielding 15 cents
or more a cubic yard, which can be
worked only by this process, yet new in
the California mining field. A fine lun
cheon was -prepared and served near
one of the dredgers by committees of
Oroville's hospitable men and women.
Some of Bntte County's big orange
and fig orchards gave surprise and dJe
â . and in town a special county
mineral exhibit, which Included several
thousand dollars' worth of gold speci
mens, was displayed. Among the m;.in
features of the varied entertainment
elaborately arranged by local commit
tees was a banquet in the evening. The
party will arrive at lone In the morn
ing for the mother lode trip*, which will
end Thursday night, thÂ» visit to
Tuolumne County having been cut out.

MARVELOUS WORK OF
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Continued From Second Page,
i after the bulletins ceased a dispatch
; came along saying that the system had
; woiked perfectly all day. Ther
been no interruptions:, and the only de
lay htul I ot Flight importance
arid that was on the land wires leading
from Xavesink into the office of the
Hi raid and The Call.
Thursday and on succeeding race
j days the steamship Ponce will leave her
pier at 9 o'clock instead of half past
9. This will make it certain that those
on '.he steamship will be enabled to see
j the yachts go over the line for the start.
Prior to the yacht races the Herald and
j The Call received from the American
Wireless Telegraph and Telephone
i Company an official letter Btatlng that
they were the owners of the Doibear
::t?. covering, they claimed, all
rights to wireless telegraphs and tele
phones In the United States, and that
they formally pretested against the use
of the Marconi system in reporting the
; cup events. The letter furtiu-r stated
that while reserving all rights to take,
. in the immediate future, such legal ac
i tlon in the matter as they might decide
. upon, they did not propose to interfere
â with and stop. the Kerala and The Call
Marconi reports, but desired it distinct
; ly understood that they made such tem
porary waive solely in the interest of
science and because of the great public
j interest in this important demonstra
tion of practical wireless telegraphy.
Professor Doibear and hi? associate?
have for year? been experimenting' on
wireless telegraphy with most s&tisfac
, tory results, and in liS6 a patent was
issued to Professor Doibear, with which
the company claims that the Marconi
patent conflicts. But in the company's
rteoua and public-spirited letter
they decline to seek to interfere with
up race reports by the Herald and
The Call. Professor Dolbc-ar's work
and the results he has obtained show
the active interest that- is being taken
in this field of science by American ln
\ ventors, and in the near future the
American Wireless Telegraph and Tele
phone Company intend to give a pub
lic exhibition of the workings of their
system.

they held undisputed sway for bo long.
As soon as sufficient reinforcements
arrive the Mexican troops will make a

the latter part of the month and
take the field against the Yaquis at the
head of two regiments of Rurales,
which will be pent from Mazatlan and

Mr. Clarke's transformer was connected j
by ordinary Insulated wires with- the mov- j
ing air Immediately above the foremast â

the Grande Duchesse. Down the vertical j

message passed to its destination.
There were many passengers on the j
Grande Duchesse who were interested in \
the experiments carried on at the tele- I
graph station aboard the ship. They i
crowded into the narrow cabin occupied j
by the mysterious instruments and puz- >
J zled over the connecting rows of batteries 'â¢

young women and men on board carried ;
away all the specimens they could obtain

In ISi James Ashbury of England made
the- first challenge, and sent over his
yacht Cambria to try for it. The race
was sailed on August 8, I*7o, under pre
cisely similar conditions to those under
which the America had won the trophyâ
the Cambria against the New York Yacht
Club's best, as the America had raced the
best of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Mr.
Ashbury's effort failed, several of the
New York boats beating the Cambria, the
Magic, the leader, being 2? minutes 32.7
seconds ahead of her at the linish. Tne
race was over the N*ew York Yacht Cluo
course.
Mr. Ashbury was not disheartened,
however, and â¢ directly upon his ar
rival in England gare orders for
a new yacht, which he called the
Livonia, and in May, IS7I, Bent over
his second challenger. Five races in ail
were sailed this time, the Livonia trying
the Columbia on October 16, 18 and .19, and
the Sappho on the 21st and 23d, and being
well beaten each rime.
The third challenge came from Ma;
Charles Gifford of the Royal Canadian
Yacht Club, in April, IS7C. It was ac
cepted, and his boat, the Countess of Dur
ferin, was beaten in two races, August
11 and "- â¢" by the Madeline.
The fourth effort came also from Can
ada but after an interim of five years.
On May 6 ISSI, Captain Alexander Cuth
bert, who had commanded the Countess
of Dufferin In her races in 1576, sent a
challenger for the. cup, with a request
that the six months' notice be waived, as
had been done before. This was agreed
to and on November 9 and 10, 1881; the
New York yacht Mischief beat Captain
Cuthbert's yacht Atalanta the first day
by 28 minutes, and the second by nearly
to minutes, sixteen miles to leeward and
return from buoy off Sandy Hook.
Sir Richard Sutton, owner of the swift
English yacht Genesta, next undertook to
beat the Americans, and February 28, I?ST>,
an official challenge in her behalf came
from the Royal Yacht Squadron. She
came over, and on September 14 and 16
measured her speed with that of the
Puritan, first over the New York Yacht
Club course and next twenty miles to lee
ward off Sandy Hook lightship and re
turn. She fared as did her predecessors
In the effort, being well beaten both days.
The sixth contest came In liS6, and was
brought about by a challenge from an
Irish naval officer, Lieutenant Kunn.R. N.,
who brought over the Galatea to be
beaten by the Mayflower on September 9
over the New York Yacht Club course by
12 minutes, and on the 10th over twenty
miles to leeward of Sandy Hook lightship
and return by 29 minutes.
In I ST the seventh challenger for the
cup appeared in the person of Vice Com
modore James Bell of the Royal Clyde
Yacht Club. His yacht, the Thistle, came
over the next year and sailed against the
Volunteer in two races, being beaten by
19 minutes over the New York Yacht Club
course on September 27, 1887, and again
on the 30th over twenty miles off Scotland
lightship and return by 12 minutes.
The eighth challenger was Lord Dun
raven of recent memory. He brought over
In 1593 the vaunted Valkyrie and had her
beaten by the Morgan-Iselln syndicate
yacht Vigilant on October 7, over fifteen
miles off Sandy Hook lightship and re
turn: on the 10th over a triangular course
of thirty miles off Sandy Hook lightship,
and on" the 13th over fifteen miles off
Sandy Hook lightship and return; the first
day by 6 minutes, the second by 10 min
utes and the third by 50 seconds.
In 1895 the ninth challenge was made for
the cup by the Dunraven syndicate. Lord
Dunraven brought over the Valkyrie 111
to try issues with the Defender. The In
cidents and outcome of that race as told
at length in The Call at the time are still
quite fresh in the minds of the public.
The American gave the British boat a
time allowance of 29 1-10 seconds ar.d beat
her on the first day (September 7) by S
minutes 49 seconds over the Sandy Kook
course, crossing the line over two miles
ahead of her. On the 10th the Valkyrie
111 beat the Defender over the triangular
course by 49 seconds, but having fouled
her at the start the committee gave the
race to the American yacht. Lord Dun
raven withdrew his boat before the next
race and the Defender went over the
course alone, winning all three races, as
had been done by the preceding defenders
of the cup.
ELEVENTH CONTEST FOR
THE AMERICA'S CUP
In 1897 Sir Thomas Johnston Upton, the
self-made multi-millionaire merchant, <
, joined the Royal Ulster Yacht Club of
â  Belfast. Ireland, with the purpose of get
ting that club to challenge in his behalf
for the America's cup, held by the New
York Yacht Club for nearly fifty years.
; despite the tfn strong contests made at
: intervals to carry it back across the At
lantic. August 24, Sir Charles Russell,
representing the Royal Ulster Yacht Club,
who had assumed Sir Thomas LÂ»ipton's
challenge, met the cup committee of the
Ne'w_York_Yacht_Club_and presented the
' challenge, the acceptance "of â which "was
at once signified.
On September 6 the challenge commit
tee of the Royal Ulster Yacht riub met
; the cup committee of the New York Yacht
i Club in Commodore J. Pierpont Morgan's
| office and agreed upon the conditions of i
I the contest, as follows: The races to bs

GIRL PROBABLY
BURNED TO DEATH
PASADENA. Oct. 3.â lt i 3 believed that
Daisy Prushaw, aged 23 years, has been
burned to death. Myron Hi.:, a. well known
young man. was calling this evening on
Mies Prushaw at her home at 252 Kensing
ton place. At 9 o'clock Hill went away
and Miss Prushaw went upstairs with a
lamp in her hand. She dropped the lamp
and it exploded. Hill saw the flames and
came back. He went upstairs, but was
driven out by the flames and smoke.
The house burned rapidly and the fire
department was late In arriving. Nobody
seemed to realize that perhaps a life was
lost. Nearly a half hour after the fire
had been extinguished a search was start
ed. Policeman Reynolds tried to get into
the girl's room, but it was burned off.
The girl faints easily, and it is thought
she fainted and was burr.cd to : death
Another theory is that the sirl was dazÂ°d
and wandered away. She is not with thÂ«=
others members of the family and they
do not know where she is.

"Penger! Tour business interests are

upon tho envelopes recently sent out to
the members of thÂ« Associated Wholesale
Croecrs of California by EL L. Loveland,
their general representative. The matter
6i>r;t to the members under cover justified
the â warning: upon the envelopes. "You

Then Mr. Loveland explained that the '

suit before the Interstate Commerce Com
mission against tho transcontinental

the rates be graded from St. Louis ;

STOMACHS THAT WONT WORK
That Retain the Food and Refuse to
Digest It, Make the Head Heavy
and the Nerves Weak,
Keoc! Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablet 3.
There Is a cure for dyspepsia. Buffer
who lave i ri< I noxious nostrums will
probably be skeptical, but skepticism
vanishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets are tried. Whether the trouble is
dyspepsia of loner stoniiir:K, or merely a
simple ense of indigestion, relief Is prompt
<i!!d pronounced. Th less the trouble the
fewer tablets need be taken.
Heaviness after eating-, sour stomach,
as indicated by belching, fatigue with
plight exertion, or with no exertion at all,
disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipa-
tion, depression, "blues," these things can
commonly be set down as symptoms of
dyspepsia. And dyspepsia is merely indi-
grstlon in on aggravated form.
By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves,
restful, refreshing sleep, pure blood and
good, sound, healthy flesh. They make
the skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind
cheerfuL
â  Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medi-
cine and more than a medicine. They di-
gÂ«-Ht the food and make It easy of assimi-
lation, and they relieve the Inflamed, dis-
f-as>cd condition of the membraneous lin-
ings and the glands of the stomach and
bowels. They help the digestive organs
over the hard places, and put them Into
a â¢â  ill -.-. active condition. They effect
a quick and permanent cure. You don't
have to continue taking them forever;
I still It is well to have a box handy and
take one at the first return of the trou-
ble.
. Perfectly well people are made sick by
eating too much, or unwholesome food,
but not If they take a tablet after eat-
ing. Treatment with Ktuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets does not necessitate dieting or any
change of habits. They digest the proper
food and let upon the other kind In such
a way as to make It pass off quickly and I
harmlessly. You may eat and drink what
you like, when you like and as much &a '
you like y you take a tablet afterward. '

THE ICEMAN WINS OUT IN A
RACE WITH THE SWELTERING SUN
OLD SOL was real hot about
something yesterday. He
was warm when he cot up in
the morning, and he did not
cool off during the day. Whatever
ailed the old fellow he took his re
venge on San Francisco, and made
a telling attempt to roast the In
habitants to a turn. The soda
water stands and the beer saloons
saved more than one life during
the day and were great factors in
frustrating the evil designs of the
sun.
It was a desperate racÂ« between
Sol and the ice man, and the ice
man seemed to have the best of it
at the finish. It was a day that
produces languidness in the or
dinary mortal. It called for the
lightest gowns of the girls, who de
fied tho scorching rays and ven
tured out for tho afternoon prom
tie to San Diego, should work along com
mon lines for the protection and preserva
tion of trade.
A copy of the petition of tho St. Louis
Traffic Bureau and other middle West or
ganizations to the Interstate Commi rce
Commission ha? been received lure. One
paragraph in the complaint indicates the
aim of the middle West Jobbers clearly.
That paragraph Is as foliows: "That in

stantially similar circumstances and con
ditions, than to San Francisco, Portland,

led In the longer distance, the fourth
n of the act to regulate interstate
commerce is completely lgnoretl and
thereby violated."
That there Is need of concerted action
is the opinion of leading business men.
Mr. Loveland has assured them that tho
railroads will defend the suit against
them only so far ns it If to th< Ir interest
to do bo, and no farther. Tt will be re
membered that a strong fight to have the

made by Messrs. Loveland and W. If.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Oct. 3.â John C.
O'Melveney is dead and Captain J. F.
Mills, formerly Lieutenant Governor of
Idaho and recently connected with the
Becond United States Volunteer En
gineer Retrlment, is in the hands of the
State authorities as the result of a
tragedy which occurred here late this
afternoon.
O'Melveney was the chief engineer of

waa In his office about 4 o'clock. It
appears he was alone when Mills en
tered The latter had made application
recently for work in O'Melveney's de
partment, but had not been accepted.
It Is claimed that he blumed O'Mel
veney. He flred three bullets into his
1 victim, then dropped the revolver and
quietly walked to General Traffic Man
ager Eccles' office nnd In the most non
chalant manner informed him of what
he had done. He s^aid:
".Mr. Eccles, i have shot Mr. O'Mel
veney. I told him this morning that I
would do bo, and have kept my word."
Police Officer Lincoln appeared on
the scene about this time nnd said:
"Are you the man who did the shoot-
Ing?" Mills snid Hint h<Â» was and he
was ;it on'-e put under arrest.
O'Metveney was shot while writing

It appears thore was no one present

exact cause of the tragedy is not

Alexandi r McAdie, who attends

It all. It came from the north, and
when it got over San Francisco it

WORMOUTH GAVE
MUCH TO CHARITY
One-Third of the Estate to Be
Dividsd Among San Francisco
Institutions.
SAN* RAFARL. Oct. 3.â The will of the
late Ebenezer Wormouth, bearing date
of last May, was filed with County Clerk
Graham yesterday by Louis H. Bonestell
of Ban Francisco, who Is named by the
Ustator as executor without bonds. The
estate is valued at about $70,000, five
sevenths being composed of real estate in
Marln County and the rest being money
invented in stocks and bonds.
W.rmouth states that lie leaves no wife
or children and that if any person con
tests his will on the. gTound of being a
wife or child anil succeeds In proving the
truth of the allegations, such person shall
receive thft sum of $10, "and no mare."
BoaesteU is directed to convert the
whole of the o-stato into money as rapldly
as may be done consistently along flnan
clal lines; to pay to each of the two sons
of his deceased brother Alexander the
sum of $1000; to eneh of the three sons of
his deceased brother Moses $2000; to each
of the three daughters of his deceas* '1
brother Moses H500; to each child of his
deceased sister Julia $2000; to his brother
William Is'ixh); to his brother Nelson tho
monthly interest on $f,OOO, and to his
brother Hamilton $500 annually as interest
and part principal of a rum of $5000 until
the- principal Is exhausted.
An important feature of the will is the
fact that one-tli!ril of thft estate is be
quea.thed to charitable societies of San
Francisco, share ami share alike. They
arc: The Boys' and (Jirly 1 Aid Society, the
San Francisco Lying-in Hospital and
Foundling: Asylum, the Hospital for Chil
dren n.nd Training School for Nurses and
the Armitage Orphanage of San Fran
cisco.
In all probability the will of Wormouth
will be contested, as It Is definitely known
that Hamilton Wormouth of Stockton
was dispatintie.l with the terms of the
document and had words with his brother
over the disposition of the estate some
timo ago.

PAPERS VALUED AT $4000
FOUND ON HIM.

Denis Conner, whose home was at 605
Broadway, died in the Harbor Hospital
yesterday from an attack of asthma. He
was stricken on the corner of Washing
ton and Sansome streets and was at once
hurried to the hospital. Dr. Dorr did
everything possible for the old man and
for a few minutes it looked as though he
was rallying. Then he collapsed and was
dead in a few seconds.
When starched at the .hospital there
was found in Conner's pocketbook a card
of admission for him to the free clinic for
the poor at the College of Physicians and
Surgeons and in another pocket a bottle
of medicine put up at the free dispensary.
Wrapped up in a handkerchief was lua
bank oook, showing that Denis Connor had
i-^'iib 91: on deposit in the Hiuerina Bank,
while in his hip pocket was $64 bo in cash.
The body was removed to the Morgue,
wnere an autopsy will be held.
Thirteen of the striking boiler-maker 3
went back to work on the transport Lee
lanaw yesterday. The men nad been
working for the Union Iron Works and
quit out of sympathy for their comrades,
iesterday morning nine of. them went to
work and during me afternoon four more
of them asked to be taken back.
The transports Zealandia, City of Para
and Valencia will probably not get away
before Saturday. The Zealandia is ready,
but the paint has not thoroughly dried.
The Para Is not yet painted, but the Va
lencia is ready to go out at any time. The i
Pennsylvania, with the Washington boys,
will probably get in to-day, and the Tar
tar, with the Kansas regiment, about Sat
urday.
The steamer Santa Rosa, which arrived
from southern ports yesterday, passed the
tugs Rescue and Monarch with the log
raft in tow about fifty miles this side of
Port Harford. There was a cross sea
running and a northwest breeze was blow
ing, but the raft seemed to be making:
"good weather of it." The tugs were com
ing along about two knots an hour.
Lieutenant Lowdenham, who came up
on the transport Valencia, is bewailing
the loss of 7000 fine Manila cigars. He I
thinks they were stolen from the trans
port wharf, but the customs officers are
of the opinion that they were stolen by
the soldiers on the ship. Captain Lane of
the Valencia is also of this opinion, as a
large number of empty cigar boxes were
found among the soldiers' baggage.
Captain Blair was back en 'Change yes
terday after a fortnight spent at Byron
Springs. His holiday has done the gallant â¢
skipper a world of good, but he is glad to
get back into harness again. Captain.
Blair is with the Alaska Commercial Com
pany.

FORGED NAME OF
HIS EMPLOYER
Charles Dean Arrested
at Santa Barbara.
Special Dis-witch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Oct. 3.â One of
the boldest forgeries ever attempted
was discovered to-day and the forger
arrested late this evening. Charles
Dean, who has been passing where he
was not known as C. H. Davis, is ac
cused of forging the name of James
Wiley, the railroad contractor, who has
a camp of stonemasons near this city,
and when arrested he told the Sheriff
that the right man had been caught.
Drink, cards and women wrecked his
life, which had been a very successful
one until the last few years. Dean was
for some time bookkeeper at the camp,
but was suspected several weeks ago
and dismissed. On September 16 and 18
he forged Contractor Wiley's name to
two time checks, which he had secured
before leaving the (.-amp, in the sum of
$52 and $170 respectively, and they were
then cashed by C. H. Frink and Ed
wards & Co. of this city.
So cleverly were the signatures made
that Wiley himself was puzzled for a |
time. After securing this money Dean I
remained in the city, spending it at the i
card table, bar and with women, and '
when caught this evening in his rooms
he had very little of the money left. He
confessed to the Sheriff that he was
the party sought.
Dean, who is a man of forty years or
more, spent his boyhood in this city,
and became a civil engineer of some
note. He was employed in the early
days by the Southern Pacific Company
In construction work, and was after
ward sent to Mexico to work at his pro
fession.
He there got possession of consider
able land and became a large catvle
owner. He spent several years In the
San Salvador republic, and during one
of the insurrections was given a com
mission of general. He is familiar with
several languages, and speaks French,
Spa.nish and German fluently. He came
from a very good family. He began
drinking heavily a few years ago. and
since then has lost most of his prop
erty. ______________

FOUL MURDER OF
A LONE WOMAN
Burned to Death in Her
Cottage.
Special Dlsi>atch to The Call.
CRESCENT CITT. Oct. B.â A report has
reached this place of a frightful tragedy
at the little town of Wedderburn, form
erly Gold Beach, in Curry County, Or.,
la3t Tuesday night.
The home of Mrs. A. J. Edson, which
was hidden from the town by a small hill,
was on Wednesday morning found to be
hi a^hes and the charred remains of Mrs.
Edson, who lived alone In the house, were
found among the cinders and debris.
The affair, which at first was presumed
to bo the result of an accident, is being
investigated, and developments begin to
hint strongly of arson and murder. The
unfortunate Lady was quite advanced In
ape and was bflieved to have had a con
siderable sum of money concealed about
the premises. She was known to have
had about $40 in silver a few days before
tho lire. Search was made in the ashes
01' the ruins, but no trace of coin or
precious metal was found, though the
services of an expert miner, with his gold
pan, were engaged. A five-gallon kero
sene can was found near the corpse, the
contents of which are presumed to have
been used to make the conflagration as
effectual as possible. It is paid that a
certain individual of generally bad repute
Is suspected of having committed the
crime.
Mrs. Edson was an old and highly es
teemed citizen of Curry County, and a
thorough investigation will be made.
ROSE ESTATE SOLD.
Property of the Late Horseman. Was
Heavily Mortgaged.
I,OS AXGEI.ES, Oct. 3.â Judge Shaw
to-day confirmed the sale of practically
all the property belonging to the estate
of the late L. J.- Rose, the millionaire
horseman. The property is heavily
mortgaged, and the sale is being mads to
avoid a foreclosure auction.
The petitldn of Amanda M. Rose, the
petitioner ar.u administratrix, shows that
the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank has
a mortgage of $271,319 Go on the estate,
and it is averred that the property at
public auction might not bring the
amount of the mortgage. Leave of the
court was asked to accept a private offer
made by the bank. The bank Is to pay
Mrs. Rose $5000 and take tho mortgaged
property, reserving all rights, however,
to continue tho furclosure suit.
The property which will be thus con
veyed Includes a vast amount of acreage,
besides the Rose house on Fourth and
Grand avenues, lots near Westlake and
500 shares in the Hotel Rose Company.

TRIUMPH OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Sl'. NOR MARCONI has just cause for pride in

i was marked by a statement of the minute at
which it was sent from the vessel, and such was the
y of the arrangements made to transmit it tint
in the space of two or three minut< bul
i to the public in front of The Call ofl
This is the second time The Call has demonstrated
the usefulness of wireless telegraphy in gathering
news. When arrangements were made for an
nouncing by that form of telegraphy the arrival

periment and the work de=-igned to be performed was
comparatively simple. The teat, however, as will be
remembered, w uccessful, and The Call
accomplished the feat of being the first newspaper in

What has now been accomplished in getting reports

made a further stride in the direction of
tricity to be its servant.
The feat of yesterday breaks the record of long dis
r.cw-g.'itherinp:. The people who watched the
n front of The Call building and
she race as they were written upon
might almost be said to have witnessed
the race. The wireless tc^eraph sent a report of
ting of the course of the yachts on each
essive tack and of every change made in the sails.
an incident of the race was omitted. As soon as
any slightest fact of interest occurred it was at once
i the shore. The electric energies
crossed the waves instant'y. and at once the reports
ross the continent over The Call's
p.l leased wire. The aggregate number of words

But what right ha- Colonel Bryan to whimper

party? I' ' . did not have

Bryan's nomination. It had a majority of 9tlverites,
I that majority could adopt a pli it ii could
rot : â  didate, and would have been com
pelled to bolt from the convention to nominate him.
This it avoided by expelling regu | itions and
seating in their place delegations that had never been
chosen in any regular State convention. The regular
deleg :u bis own State was expelled in that
way, though it.- credentials and commission were as
kgai and regular as those of the California or any
body. In its place we
sealed a delegation headed by Bryan, which brought
no en from any Democratic State convention
regularly called and held. Other States were treated
in the same manner, and at last, in Michigan, regulars
were expelled and men put in their place who had
not been in any convention at all. the National Con
tion illegally and corruptly assuming the func
tions of a State convention for that purpose. In this
way Mr. Bryan ;ejcured his two-thirds majority and
the nomination. By these means he pot control of
the party organization and the power to so use it as
to exclude from the party all men who do not favor
his renomination.
It is the fear that the organization ?o acquired will
throw him that send.- him on a pilgrimage to Texas to
mM hi- whimper to the squeals of Governor ! !
With such a record of fraud used to control a
Nation tion, what could be expected of him
trol *ji ballot-boxes or in the.
use of public authority ?
The brain- of the Democracy refused to support
him in 1806 largely because of the shameful ways in
which he -eourcd power in the convention, and the
memory of it rank:- yet and will not down.
So it does not lit- in the mouth of this beneficiary
oi tyranny and corruption in his own party to charge
like offenses upon the party which whipped him.
He is under engagement to Btump Kentucky for
Goebel, whose nomination it is not denied was se
cu'ed by the same method used by Bryan, with
bribery added to fraud and unfairness. The flower
of the silver Democracy of Kentucky, supporter; of
Bryan, have published the proof of the criminal
nominal yet Colonel Bryan will go from
denouncing I Republican frauds to glorify
Democratic bribery in Kentucky.
The young man has too many irons in the fire and
will get hold of^he hot end of some of them.

JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.
PARLIAMENT being out of session and the
Prime Minister in retirement nursing the weak
ness of old age, Joseph Chamberlain, though
holding the comparatively subordinate office of Sec
retary of State for the Colonies, seems to be virtually
the British Government. His is the brain that devises
the policy of the empire at the danger point in the
Transvaal, and it is his voice that gives the commands
which set all the arsenals and the navy-yards of the
empire to working day and night, hurries troops
across the ocean, and, while professing in public a
desire for peace, sounds warlike in every tone.
There have been many extraordinary careers in the
history of parliamentary Goverunrent in Great Brit
ain, but hardly any ttiat is more strange than that oi
the all-powerful Colonial Minister. Something like
fifty years ago the son of a rich Londoner was
t-ent by liis father to Birmingham to engage in the
work of a manufacturer. He grew up to be a suc
cessful business man, but his chief interest was in
politics. He began as a republican, and at one time
joined in a movement to start an agitation for the
abolition of the monarchy upon the death of the pres
ent rovereign. In tho*e days he was one of the men
whom the Conservatives of Great Britain, the sup
porters of the crown and the church, regarded with
the utmost detestation. They mocked at him, they
&neered at him. They called him "Brummagem Joe,"
the "Capital I," the "Petty Jack Cade," and a dozen
other things. "I am the worst abused man in Eng
land," he said on one occasion, and he had good rea
son to say it
One statesman of the time of his early career put
a different construction upon ht3 character and his
conduct. No man did Chamberlain more severely
attack in those days than Disraeli, but that cynical old
politician refused to take him seriously. "He wishes
to be a Duke," said Disraeli, and dismissed him with
a sneer.
The later career of the radical leader of Birmingham
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. OCTOBER 4. 1899.
| goes far to confirm the satirical estimate put upon the
! sincerity of his republicanism by the Tory leader.
Chamberlain broke away from the Liberal party at the
time of Gladstone's home rule bill for Ireland, and
ever since then has become more and more a Tory,
lie has never, however, had the full confidence of the.
Conservative party, and when the present Ministry
. was formed the leadership of the Commons went to
j lialfour. and Chamberlain had to content himself
with the office of Colonial Minister, one which has
hitherto been a good place for a man of business
training and executive ability, but hardly a place in
which an aspiring politician could nuke a dis
tinguished career.
Chamberlain, however, has proved there is moT
', in the man than there is in the otYice. fit- has eclipsed
his colleague- who hold higher offices i" the Cabinet
and has almost overshadowed the Prime Minister
himself. To-day he is the dominant man in the em
pire Ilis word? have mere weight than those of
any other. He seems to be the man who direct'- ihe
forces of imperialism, and if he succeed in destroy
ing the last vestige of Dutch Independence in South
Africa and adding that vast country to the Rriti-h
pire he may yet fulfill literally the sarcastic taunt
oi hi< fonfler political opponent. "Brummagem Joe"
may be a Puke.

T a meeting last May the Chamber of Com
/ \ merce of this city adopted a series of resolutions
"â declaring that whereas the inten rts of the whole
country, increased employment for our people, a
larger home demand for the products of our farms,
our mines, oui forests and our factories, the rein
forcement of our navy, the enlargement of foreign
markets for our surplus products, the reduction in
rates of ocean transportation, would all be promoted
by the restoration of our merchant marine in its for
â  -it ion on the seas of the world; and as the
r | \ increasing opportunities for commercial ex
pansion and the employment of a larger shipping
upon the Pacific, i"or the transportation of our grow
ing exports, emphasizes the need of establishing and
â¢ mg an American merchant marine equal to the
need-; of our foreign commerce; therefore, it is the
opinion of the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
oisco that it i< the duty of the Congress of the United
States at the earliest day possible to enact legislation
to secure restoration on the lines recently reported
favorably to both branches of Congress by the Com
mittee on Commerce on the part of the Senate, and
the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on
the part of the Tlnu ;e.
Since the adoption of the resolutions the Chamber
has not been inactive. It procured the introduction
of the issue to the attention of the Trans-Mississippi
â  Wichita and urged i: with such success
that the congress adopted resolutions in line with
those of the Chamber itself, and is now making
further efforts to impress upon the National Congress
the urgent, need of prompt and effective legislation
for the upbuilding of our shipping industries.
It is gratifying to note the activity of our Chamber
of Commerce in this important work. The Pacific
Coast has a? much to hope for from the upbuilding
of the merchant marine of the nation as any other
section. In fact it has more to look forward to, for
the Atlantic Oce;m commerce is now well supplied
with shipping and any new ships launched upon itd
waters by Americans will have a strong competition
to encounter in the foreign ships, but the commerce
of the Pacific i-^ an expanding one. The shipping ade
quate for the trade of to-day will fall far short of
the demand of the trade that is to be within a few
years. The question is whether the United States
shall furnish the additional tonnage need for the grow
ing: trade, or whether Europe is to be permitted to
do it.
Thi issue is In fact the moÂ«t pressing that will come
before Congress with the sole exception of that of
l^urrency reform. It ha< been under consideration a
long time and there should be no further delay in
| dealing with it.
THE SENATE AND CURRENCY REFORM
rROM reports that conic to us from the East it
appears there is some doubt whether the Senate
will enact any important measure of currency
reform at the coming session of. Congress. The Phil
adelphia Record claims to have accurate inside
information that the Republican committees of the
House and the Senate which have been considering
the matter cannot agree upon a deiinite scheme of
legislation. On the other hand. Congressman Bab
cock of Wisconsin, a member of the committee, is
quoted by the Times-Herald of Chicago 33 saying
that while the Senate Committee has not yet con
curred with the bill proposed by the House Com
mittee, the objection would be overcome and that the
bill is likely to pass both houses.
The measure agreed upon by the House committee
is not radical and it would be a severe setback to the
prosperity of the country if the Senate should inter
pose to prevent its enactment. The Senators can
hardly fail to recognize the importance of the issue
and the urgency of the need of settling the question
at this session. It h time to take the finances of the
nation out of politics and to establish our monetary
system on the gold basis beyond dispute.
Upon what ground the opponents of currency re
form expect the Senate to defeat the will of the peo
ple has not been made known. That the hope is a
forlorn one is clear. The administration is pledged
to reform the monetary system and will urge it upon
Congress. The great mass of the people favor it.
and the House is sure to pass a currency bill and
send it to the Senate early in the session. There will
doubtless be a hard fight against it, but as there is
not only a good Republican majority in the Senate
but several sound money Democrat*, like Lindsay of
Kentucky and Caffery of Louisiana, to vote for it,
its passage seems fairly well assured, despite the
rumors to the contrary.
So it appears after all that the interests of the Out
landers in the Transvaal are the last concern of Great
Britain. The Boers are to be whipped because they
are suspected by the British of plotting future evil.
Perhaps the recent continent of a Britisn statesman
that England is a pirate nation was correct
The evidence that the Germans covet Samoa is a
proof of the iniquity of the Kaiser and his peopla.
It is not righteous to covet anything except the Phil
ippines and we have a pre-emption on that.

PRESS COMMENTS
Success of the State Fair.
Pacific Rural Press.
As foreshadowed In lust week's Pacific
Rural Press, the ri!atp Fair thl* year has
proved exceptionally grt-at In point of
popularity and patronage. It is described
from Sacramento a? the must lury<-ly
attended and successful fair the capital
city has ever known, it Is utated that
the receipts exclusive of the pool privilege,
amount to close on to $23,000, as againat
5U.705 last year. The society will realize
$10,000 over expenses. This result is
largely due to the most diligent and well
planned effort made by the management
thie year to popularize the exposition in
every possible way and to the fact that
Sacramento was well aroused to the ad
vamagu which the fairs are to the city
interests. It is very important to Sac
ramento that such a record is being made
and it will make its mark, no doubt, upon
future legislation. The management of
the society also did very wisely in en
listing the interest and good will of local
Journals and in furnishing available news
to all avenues of publication. Secretary
Shields has certainly won his spurs in
this contest and should be duly honored.
We are well aware that some of the
attractions at the fair were anything but
agricultural, but they seemed to be neces
sary to win popular interest, and, hav
ing this, the exhibitors of strictly agri
cultural excellence were indirectly advan
taged by being able to reach wide assem
blages. Make the fair more popular and
It will draw more exhibitors of the better

j fri-m Charles E. Bateman; foreman of the
I letter department at Station D. Mr. Ford
I explained that the postal officials were
j compelled to weigh every letter supposed
to be short of postage. There were sev
eral sets of scales for this purpose in the
office, and no short weight letter had
: mvi â¢ chance to escape detection, as It
passed down the line and was inspected
successively by several men. Short-paid
matter would not connect a= fully paid
matter would, for the examination and
rating of the letters Insufficiently stamped
took time. No fault could be attached to
the post office on account of the delay, for
the cause was solely the neglect of the
people. He had a record kept of the
amount of short postage checked up in six
j days, and by this means he arrived at the
I somewhat sensational fact that an aver
| age of 500 letters ore daily held up at Sta-
I tion D for short postage.
"You will do the public a favor by call
: inp attention to this matter," feai'd Mr.
i Ford. 'â¢This is the only office In the
â¢ United States where letters mailed only
twelve minutes fore the boat starts
connect. Of course, short postage letters
deposited at the last minute do not go for
, ward without delay. The business men
should see to. it that all letters are fully
j stamped/
W. A. Cooper at Station D added to the
j information concerning the shortage of
j postage. One-filth of the letter mail for
! the Hawaiian Islands was short of post
; age, bo Mr. Cooper said. There had been
i no change In the postal rates to the Ha
waiian Islands since annexation, except
to soldiers and sailors of the navy. When
letters reached Honolulu short of postage
the addressees were compelled to pay
double the shortage, for a penalty was
attached. Many ms were sending out
advertising letters short of postage. The
persons who received these advertising
letters would have to pay the- penalty.
Merchants would thereby get th* 111 will
instead of the good will of the persons

Opinion of Regulars Upon the
"Regular Volunteers."
The following letter published by the
Freedom of Manila on August 13 of this
year shows in what esteem the men who
'enlisted in the regular organizations, or
"regular volunteers" as they were called,
are held by their former comrades.
BALIKAG, Luzon. Aug. 44, 1599. j
Edit Freedomâ Dear Kir: I hope you v.iil
make room for the following remarks In your
paper as i on as convenient:
The volunteer regulars will be dropped from
the rolls of their different organizations by the
tatter part of this week, but will those men be j
forcotten by the comrades they leave behind?
No; they Will never be forgotten by their com- ,
rades of the Eighth Army Corps v.-ho fought
with them through this campaign.
If there ever was a soldier returning to his
native country that is deserving any glory or
that ought to be received with open arms by ,
the people of the United States, that soldier
Is the volunteer regular.
I will say a few words of the volunteer reg
ulars of Battery 'Â». Third Artillery. I have
been in the service twenty-three years, and
during that time I have seen several batteries,
troops and companies in Europe and !n ibÂ»
United State?, but never have I \ en such a
body of men a. - composed the above nam.>d
battery during this campaign, for their Intel
ligence and bravery could not be questioned on
the firing line.
These volunteer regulars came personally un
der my obwrviation. I had the opportunity of
watching them during the different battles and
skirmishes, and I must say that every one of
them was more than willing to advance to the
front, and on several occasions 1 had to call
them back on the line.
I am not a newspaper writer, this being my
first attempt. I desire to express myself sim
ply as to wxiat I have seen and observed.
I hope that all of the volunteer regulars will
enjoy their trip across the Pacific, and that
their experience of flftepn or sixteen months In
service under such trying circumstance will
benefit them In civil life. With the best wishes
of JOHN C. O'CONNOR,
First Sergeant Battery (i, Third Artillery.

AN OLD LADY WHO IS
DETERMINED TO MARRY
THERE was considerable mystery attached to the arrival of the over
land train at the Oakland mole yesterday. The news had leaked out
that there was a runaway couple aboard. The woman was supposed
to have gone out of her mind at Ogden, and had to he put in a strait
jacket. The man had taken possession of the woman's money and the
train officials, thinking- he was going to appropriate the money to his own
use, took it away from him and also took charge of the woman. 'â Â*!;?
As soon as the overland reached Oakland the man and the woman with
their baggage were .turned over to Train Dispatcher J. C. Phillips with the
Instructions to bring them to San Francisco and turn them over to the police.
Phillips reported to Captain Dunleavy at the Harbor Police Station, and the
captain sent him out to Chief I>ees with his charges.
The woman is Mrs. Frederika Schall. aged 49 years, and the man is
Frank Trappehl, aged 38 years, both of Pittsburg, Pa. Mrs. Schall was
formerly a Mrs. Pieton, and by her first husband she had four children, all of
them, save one, a girl aged 15 years, being now married. Her first husband
died about eight years ago, and then Mrs. Pieton married Schall. About
eight months ago Schall dropped dead, and now his widow wants to marry
TjYappehl.
Trappehl is a machinist, and seven years ago was employed in the Ful
ton Iron Works. Soon after the molders' strike he went to Pittsbur?, and
ever yince has been working in the Westinghouse Electrical Machine Works.
He became acquainted with Mrs. Schall and proposed marriage. The
daughters were opposed to the wedding, however, so the couple started for
California. During the journey across the continent Mrs. Schall became
very nervous and hysterical. It was then that Trappr-hl took from her $370
In currency and a couple of checks for small sums of money she had in her
possession.
A doctor who was on the train advised .that Mrs. Schall be put In a
sleeper, and Trappehl says he paid $3 for the berth. She was given mor
phine to quiet her. but the next day she was violent, and while the train
was at Ogden tried to escape through the window. She was then strapped
down, but was released as soon as she showed signs of returning sanity.
The couple were examined by Chief Lees and gaid It was their intention
to get married at once. As both of them seemed perfectly able to take care
of themselves the police could do nothing in the case. On the advice of the
chief Mrs. Schall left $300 of her cash with the property clerk, and if in a
couple of days she dots not change her mind and is still determined to marry
Trapp-'hl, the money will be returned to her.
TrappeJil is furious with the Southern Pacific officials, and says he Is
going to bring a suit against the railroad for damages.
TRIED TO HANG
HERSELF FROM
A WINDOW-SILL
Used a Clothesline
for a Noose.
Mrs. A. Ferroggiaro, residing at 607
â  Greenwich street, is supposed to have at
'â  tempted suicide in a tragic manner yes
terday morning. H< r life was only saved
by the prompt action of neighbors and a
; police officer, and also by the frail quality
I of a rope which was used in the surmised
attempt. After the lady had been re
i moved from her perilous position she de
-1 nled the alleged attempt at suicide, but
! the statement of officers and witnesses
I will not bear out her assertions. The only
! cause for the act which cau be given by
the family is that the woman has been
ill for a short period of time, and this,
with other family troubles, rendered hÂ»r
mentally unbalanced.
Shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morn
ing Mrs. L. V.'egel, who resides at Cv!Â»
Greenwich street, heard a commotion in
the yard which separates her homy from
that' of the Ferrogglaros. She rushed to
the window and wa,s startled to behold
the body i-f a woman dangling in the air
a considerable distance above xhf ground.
She cried for help, and her daughter, Mrs.
' Chris Zimmer, came to her assistance. Be-
I fore Mrs. Zimrm-r could reach the spot the
series of ropes which suspended the
' woman had become partially unfastened,
i and the body fell till it nearly reached
the ground. " Mr?. Zimmer then grasped
, the dangling form and loosened the rope.
; Police Officer Alvarcs. who happened to
! be passing the house and who heard the
I woman's "cries for help, rushed into the
yard and cut the rope.
The woman seemed bent on self-de
struction. She had tied a clothesline
â  around her neck and placed three knots
under her chin. The line was stretched
across the yard aiid when the woman
jumped from the second-story window sill
h^r body swung out far from the buikl
. ing. For a moment or two the form hung
in space, but the pulleys over which the
i lines passed finally pave away and the
' body fell close to the ground. Mrs. Zim
mer pays that when she loosened the rope
on the' neck that Mrs. Ferroggiaro tried
to strangle herself by tightening the
â¢ r.oopp on her throat. It was th.^ opinion
j of witnesses that had the woman known

The patrol wagon was called and the
woman taken to the California street sta
tion by Officer Bakulich. It was found
that she did not suffer much from the
shock, and shortly afterward was re
turned to her home. She protested that
she was hanging clothes on the lines and
accidentally became tangled up in them,
but no one saw any clothes in the vicin

A BIG FLEET.
Twelve Vessels Arrive Within Two
Days Chartered to Carry Grain
From California.
A large fleet of ships, most of which
will be available f<s% grain charters, ar
rived In -his harbor between Saturday
morning vtA Sunday night. There were
twenty .'easels in all, of which -number
eighteen were foreigners.
Twelve have been chartered to take
cargoes of wheat from California. These
twelve ships will carry 32,000 long tons
Of grain, and at the average rate of $8
per ton, will earn for their owners $256,
-" fr.-ight money.
A few were French ships, subsidized by
their Government at the rate of 34 cent's
per ton for each 1000 miles traveled in
direct course. Thr-se subsidies are paid
i.n the Oasis of the gross tonnage, so
that the quarters for the officers und'
crews are unusually large, there being in
I one case a deduction of about 900 tons
j from the gross.
Animals' Little Friends.
Band of Mercy exercises were held yes
terday by four classes of the I/ongfeilow
Primary School on Silver street, near
Harrison. Nearly all the ladies of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals have been at work organizing
these hands in the public schools, and now
th* membership of the pupils Is over 50 000
children. These frequently hold public
exercises, consisting' of songs, recitations
and compositions, the tenor of which Is to
impress the importance of treating: ail
dumb creatures with kindness.
Violated Fish Laws.
Salvadore Rappo, the fishprman who
was arrested for violating- the law by
fishing between the Ist and 15th insts!,
had pleaded guilty before a Suisun jus
tire of the peace, who imposed the pen
alty nf a $200 fine or 100 days in Jail.
Rappo decided to serve out the sentence
and save the money. Deputy Kercheval
yesterday confiscated 200 pounds of under
sized rtriped bass. The fish was divided

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1899.
BERNARDILLO
HAD TO BE
PULLED UP
A Hot Favorite He Was Again
Attacked With Staggers.
Winners at Oakland.
Just as he had about disabused his
friends of the Idea that he was an Invalid
no longer, Bernardillo started a 1 to -
favorite at Oakland yesterday and was
again seized with an attack of the stag- |
gers. The distance was one mile, and the I
hooded horse was cast In with some very j
ordinary samples of horseflesh. He led
for something over half the distance,
when the bunch behind closed on him.
He ran out as the stretch was reached,
carrying RapidÂ© and P. A. Flnnegan with
him, ruining the chances of both. Ward j
then began pulling up the distressed
racer. The accident caused a gap to be
opened, through which Devin on the 10 to
1 shot, Alicia sneaked and at the wire
led Orady, a 59 to 1 chance, out a length.
After the race Trainer Jimmy Coffer said
that he would retire Bernardino, as his
malady seemed incurable. .
Of the other favorites three were suc
cessful. Clarando, the entry of Caesar j
Young, was accorded liberal support to
win the second event, but ran unplaced.
The bookmakers say money Is plentiful In
the ring, but notwithstanding this fact
the best they can do is break even.
Her first start this season Humidity
reigned a 1 to 4 choice for the opening six
1 furlong sprint, winning in ragtime from
Faversham. The latter was well backed
for the place and disposed of Jack Me-
Ca.be without effort. Billy A again started, j
but could not last the route.
AShen the barrier was raised on the I
seven starters In the dash that followed, j
also a six furlong run, Clarando, the la
vorite, with Ward up. was away seventh.
The gelding displayed speed but did not
llniah among the first three. Yule, at odds j
of (i to 1. came fast under punishment the
last furlong, beating out the leader, Neg
ligence, a head. Major Cook, a contender
throughout, ran third.
Jim Grant's natty filly. Princess Zeika,
turned oil another purse In the scramble
for two-y ear-olds after a hard-fought duel
with The Echo. The latter, piloted by Ruiz,
made all the running, and was only col
lared and beaten out in the last few
strides. San To mas closed e<;iial choice
with the winner In the betting, but de- <
veloped a nasty disposition, trying to take
the outside fence with Thorpe soon after
the start.
The fieet-footed Amasi made a runaway
race of the closing number, a six furleng
spin. This was one of the best betting
races of the day. there being no pro
nounced choice. Kovla, of the whole field,
made the gamest bid, but could not get
up, falling short by half a length at the
wire. Sorrow came from, the rear, finish
ing third. Â

LYMAN MOWRY WAS CRUEL.
His Wife Granted an Absolute
Decree of Divorce.
Elizabeth Mowry was awarded the de
cree of divorce In her suit against her
husband, Lyman I. Mo wry, the attorney,
by Judge Troutt yesterday on the ground
of extreme cruelty. The parties were mar
ried In San Jose twelve years ago. They
moved to this city and took up their resi
dence at 316 Haight street, where the acts
of cruelty commenced. One of the chief
causes of complaint, as stated in the court
by Mrs. Mowry, was her husband's con
stant habit of smoking cigars alleged to
be of the Chinatown variety. His business
for many years was derived from Chinese
merchants and companies, /
Mrs. Mowry testified that she was a
professional singer, and that her husband
would come into her bedroom at all hours
of the night and smoke the noxious weed
until her eves were sore and her throat
affected. She had entreated him to cease
the objectionable practice, but without
avail. When she remonstrated with him
she was assailed with profane epithets.
Mowry kept up the same course of con
duct at 1719 Oak street, and at the Berk
shire. His wife says that sho was com
pelled to go to restaurants, as he was ab
sent so often that she was ashamed to go
into the dining-room for fear of comment.
Mrs. Mowry also said that her husband
had only given her $6 25 the last month
they lived together, and his conduct made
her so sick that she was at times inca
pacitated from engaging In her profession.
Her husband also abused her when he
was in liquor. Her testimony was cor
roborated by Mrs. M. 11. Lewis and Mrs.
Virginia Harden, and she was.given a de
cree absolute.

thai when the demand was made there
was money to the credit of the bond and
coupon nmds In the treasury. Widber
refused payment because, prior to the de
mands Hi Meyer, ether holders of bondb
and coupons had made iplmilar demands
and had beefl refused, which gave them a
preferred claim against the fund indefi
nltely. The Supreme Court holds ihat
there Is nothing In the Dupont-street act
which gives preference of payment to
any. as relating- to the presentation of de
mands.
Another point In the contest was that
at the time Meyer made his demand cer
tain money had been deposited with the
Treasurer by the Tax Collector. A por
tion of this money was collected on ac
count of the Dupont*stree< fund, but it
had never been segregated or placed to
the cPfdit of the fund. The lower court
held that it was not applicable to Meyer's
demand. Meyer claimed this was in
error. The question was whether this
money so deposited in sacks with the
Treasurer could be used by him for the
payment of Meyer's bonds. The Supreme
Court held that this money was simply as
a quasi special deposit, and that the
Treasurer had no authority to pay it out
at the demand of any one or at the ex
pense of any fund. The Judgment and
order of the lower court was reversed
with direction to take further proceed
ings in accordance with the opinion ren
dered by the higher tribunal.

Golden Gate Park Driving As
sociation Will Promote a
Big Race Meet.
The fall race meeting of tlie Golden i
Gate Park Driving Association will be
held at lnpleside track on the 21st inst.
The track will bo prepared especially for i
the trotters anil It Is expected the success :
of the Kprlng meeting will be duplicated.
Entries will close next Tuesday, at
which time the various horses entered
will be classllled. A committee passes
upon the speed of the horses and decides
where each one is entitled to start. Ihe [
choice bits of the programme will be a :
double team race and the second contest
for the Frai.k G. O'Kane trophy. This
Is held by J. ('. Ohliindt, who won it at
the Oakland meeting.
At a meeting in the rooms of the asso- j
elation in the Palace Hotel last night
Charles F. Kapp suggested a new method
of running a race, which will be tried at
the forthcoming meeting. By its spon
sors it is claimed that it may revolution
ize trotting races. In brief it is this: If
j a race has eight entries they are divided
| Into two heatÃ of four horses each. The
winners of these heats meet to decide [
the ownership of first and second money, j
The six horses remaining then race for '
third money. This Is expected to result !
in genuine raring from start to finish. The ]
scheme has its defenders and detractors, i
who will dlscut>B it ln all Its phases at I
their next meeting.
Polo in the Park.
A coaching parude in miniature â will j

Country Club. They will go direct to
Golden Gate Park, where they will play '
polo ln the. natural amphitheater used |
as a public baseball field, west of the j
music stuiid. They will use some fifty ;
of the tier test ponies in the State during
the piHi^r'-HP of the game.
Polo as played by the Burllr.game men.
Is a brilliant, sensational Bpectacle. It
relegates football, baseball, boxing. Teddy
Roosevelt's Rough Riders and some circus
riding to the background. The teams are :
evenly balanced and as the players have .
bad a season's practice they are all ln
good condition. No admission fee is ex- |
acted, the play being out ln the open;
where all visitors to the park may view it.

The prominent business men -who fan- j

POSTUM CEREAL.
A COFFEE EXPERIMENT.
Not Likely to Be Repeated.
"The work of a newspaper corre- j
spondent involves constant thought and ;
fetudy, with consequent brain and nerve j
â weariness. It may interest you to know â¢
Â©f my experience with coffee.
"Some years ago I was compelled to |
give it up, and after a few years' ab-
etinence started its use again, at break-
fast only. Within a few weeks I was
compelled to abandon it, as I became ,
nearly paralyzed.
"During the forenoon of each day my
arms and wrists were so benumbed that
2 could use h 1:1 with difficulty. Alarm-
Ing symptoms began to develop which !
my physician informed me were the
forerunners of apoplexy. Coffee was
therefore foresworn. Milk, of which I
t -was very fond, made me intolerably
> |3rowsy-and stupid. .
"About two years ago my attention j
\vas ciillsd to Postum Cereal Pood Cof-
, fe^, and a trial was made, believing
that if it proved half as valuable as '
claimed it would be of great advantage j
to rr.o. On the first trial it tasted rather {
Insipid to our strong coffee loving fam- i
ily, but a little freer use of Postum and !
longer boiling produced a delicious !
-drink, and within a short time the !
members of the family, one and all, had j
.. - become lent advocates of Postum |
Food Coffee.
"In my own case it has worked won- j
ders. I work more constantly than
â  ever, but my general health is better
than at any time in my life, and the
symptoms of nervous trouble have
T.iiolly disappeared. About eight
months ago I made one more trial of
coffee, reducing it with nearly half !
milk. The experiment lasted four or i
five days, and is not likely to bo re- I
peated. The nervous suffering that fol- \
lowed was indescribable, and I did not â 
recover from its effects for nearly two '
weeks. â  ;-.:

Delegations to the Republican Conven
tion have district favorites. The chair
man of the delegation frequently says,
"Mr. Blank is the choice of the district |
and we will accept no other candidate." \
The new charter expressly provides that ,
the Supervisors shall be ohosen at large. !
District boundaries should not bÂ« taken ;
into account. True enough, th Mission, j
the Western Addition, the North Beach
district. South San Francis- i and the
business cent ere of the city should be rep- j
resented in the board, but the notion that !
each one of the Assembly districts should â 
have the nomination of a candidate is not
Justified by the charter. Under the next
apportionment of legislative districts the
number of Assembly districts will not cor
respond to the number of Supervisors. It !
merely happens that the nujnbers . now
correspond.
It Is assumed that the leading mer
chants, bankers, contractors, builders, j
professional men, property owners, manu
facturerS und taxpayers generally are sin
cere in their declarations that the future '
prosperity of the city depends i^rgely
upon an honest and proper administra
tion of municipal affairs, but they cannot I
get the good government so earnestly j
hoped for unless they turn out a:;.! get It I

deal of future responsibility and trouble i
can be avoided. ;,â¢â¢..' <

Acknowledges a Call From Governors
Ortiz r.nd Canedo by Sanding
Them a Pass to Ride on
a Tugboat.
ThÂ© churlish character of Governor
Gage and the fact that he lacks apprecia
tion of the dignity of his office has again j
been manifested in his treatment of two
representatives of the Mexican republic,
who were recently on a visit to this city.
It is no new thine for the present Gover- j
nor of California to insult bis own people; j
It Is not a novelty for him to slight dis
tinguished officials from sister States who .
have come to Caiiicruia expecting to re
ceive from our chief executive a display
of hospitality and generosity which is the;
boasted characterise of the coast; but |
the people ware not prepared lor the
humiliation consequent upon the highest
official at their State snapping his angers
a; two prominent diplomats from a for
eign country, who came- here on a. mission |
01 friendship with the object in view of
establishing closer commercial and social
relations between the nations.
uage = treatment of uiese visitors liter- ;
aliy arove mem away from the city The ;
Mexican Consul. A. K. Coney, is greatly ;
chagrined at the reception accoraed his :
fealow countrymen by the Governor of
California. â  ;/; :*-'-..
Governor Ortiz of Sonora and Governor
Francisco Canedo of Sinaloa came to San
i'rancisco a few weens ago and became
the guests of Consul Coney. One of the
primu objects of their visit was to look ;
into the business relations of California
and the Mexican States, and if possible i
tiring their commercial ... rests still :
closer together. Their presence here was :
made known to the Governor and the of- ;
ncials of the city. Borne entertainment ,
wuti given the gentlemen by the Mayor-, i
but >;.;Â«;'â¢ persistently refused to ac
ki:owlesge their presence.
Presuming that notice of their visit had i
not reached Gage the Mexican officials
called upon him personally at the Palace
Hotel. He did not receive them and they
left their cards, expecting that the Gov
ernor would pay his respects to them as
soon as he got around to it. Several days
went by and still Gage made no acknowl- I
edgment of the call and steadfastly re- j
fused to take cognizance of the visitors'
presence in San Francisco.
Evidently some one told him of the mis
take he was making: and Gage, made a
clumsy attempt to retrieve himself and!
make amends. This attempt added Insult
to Injury and so disgusted the Mexicans ;
that they left the State at once.
The third day after their visit to him at
the Palace Governors Ortiz and Canedo i
received an envelope from Gago. There !
wr-s no letter in it; 11 contained only the |
executive's card and a pans which, he had j
secured from the quartermaster's depart- j
rat-nt, U. 8. A., permitting the Mexican
Governors to take a ride around the bay
on the tug McDowell on one of nor regular
trips â the same style of pass that almost
any one can get for the asking. The gen
tlemen were so provoked at the Gover
nor's Idea of entertaining visitors that
they tore up the passes and returned to
their own country
"Governors Canedo and Ortiz were
sham"' treated during their visit to
this city, said Consul Coney yesterday.
"They were almost entirely ignored by the
officials. They are prominent men. In I
their country -and they came here for the I
purpose of bettering if possible the com
mercial relations of this State and Mcx- I
lco. They v â¢â â¢ certainly entitled to some i
consideration, and I know that they fee)
keenly the eliiiht that was shown them. I
was greatly humiliated over the matter,
as I had led them to believe that they
v.-ould be treated with the consideration
due to their prominence In official circles
In their own country." j

PRESIDENT WHEELER
MEETS HIS STUDENTS
Urges College Men to Be Loyal to Their
University.
The Arbiter of Berkley's Destiny Wins the Hearts of the
Stndent Body in an Eloqne.t Appeal to Their
College Patriotism.
BERKELEY, Oct. 3.â The students of the University of California saw
c their newly elected president this morning for the first time. It was a
happy introduction between some 2000 young men and women and the
man who has Just come from the East to be the central figure in their
college life. That the utmost good feeling is going to exist between Pres
ident Wheeler and the students was clearly shown in his bearing before
them this morning and their hearty applause to everything he said.
The formal introduction took place In the open air upon the college campus
shortly before 12 o'clock. About 4000 people gathered in a large semicircle arouna
the flagpole in front of the library building to watch the proceedings and to catch
the words of the president's address.
About 11:80 President Wheeler, accompanied by Professor Bernard P. Moses,
left the president's office in South Hall and walked toward the assembled gather
ing. 'At the sight of the president the college men raised their hats, and for a
minute the sharp, quick yell of Cornell University Went ringing across the cam
pus. As President Wheeler stepped upon the small platform erected for him he
was given three rousing cheers, and then came the
"Ha! Ha! Ha!
California!
TJ. C. Berkeley,
Zip! Boom! Ah!"
From professors and students alike, it was the college men's recognition of a col
lege man, and the new president seemed to feel, as it burst forth from the thou
sands present, that he was indeed from that moment the president of the student
body of the University of California.
President Moses had been asked by the students to make the introduction, and
he did it in a. lew weii chosen words. Professor Moses said:
"Mr. President: It gives me great pleasure, on behuif of the university, to ex
tend to yuu a hearty welcome on thes-.e grounds and to present to you this body of
students. They are California's most excellent pioduci. They are not the tran
sient guests ol the State, to be scattered later in the four quarters of the Union.
They are here at home, and except in rare Instances th>y are to remain with us,
to carry toward completion on these shores the social structure whose lounda-
Lready hiiU.
"It is, sir, the welfare of these students, the welfare of the students who are
to come after them, and therefore the welfare of the commonwealth, that must be
the absorbing object of your attention and thought. Their moral and intellectual
career mu^t be ihe justification of our labor and our living here.
â¢."ntt; of the university, it gl\es me great pleasure to present to you Dr.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the university." (.Applause.)
In reply, President Wheeler said: "Students of the University of California:
I rejoice that my first introduction to the university takes the form of an intro
dui tlon to \ou. Thus far this university has been to me more or less a thing of
the imagination. I have known of it lÂ«"the form of statutes and reports, names
ties, iorms and observances. I have seen its admirable register. I have
honorable governing board in session. I have seen Its buildings, its
equipment, Its mechanism, its gardens and its trees. lint now, standing here in
t he golden sunlight by its help under this real blue canopy, I look into the faces
of the real blue and gold that constitutes the real, living University of Callfor-
Applar.se.) Nov.- from this hour I know that lam a member in a real and
living association, because lam joined in association with men. The only thing
that is of Interest to me in a university is menâ and women. As long as I live
I trust 1 may never be Interested in a university of mechanisms, reports and
paper, but only In a university of human beings. (Applause.)
"it has been a solicitude on my part lest in entering a presidential office I
might be so absorbed In administrative things that my own loved teaching might
â â¢. from me, and It will be a disappointment to me if in any wise my
hail separate me from active interest in student affairs. Almost the
ation 1 have this morning in entering upon my work is the belief
that 1 am g ill g to know you and to have to do with you intimately; for all this
w irk oi the presidential office is burden and care. It is only done in order that
â¢ : shed, the real object, the bringing forward of a uni
versity made up of students.
"1 want you to find In meâ to believe from the beginning and throughout
ive in me a personal friend. (Applause). 1 shall i sard my mission
'..â¢â¢:' as a failure if that is not the case, l want you to come to Bee me, and to
rsons. Tell me your namesâ l beg of you, tell me your namesâ
: â  . â â¢â¢ me, for whenever I see a man that I have seen before I am
apt to refnember him and to remember a good deal about him- almost everything
- -â¢â  come up to me and say, 'My name Is ' and if
; â  tifl to be Smith, give the initials. (.Laughter.) Please don't be afraid to
â  'it petty matters, little matters. What interests you will interest me.
.)])â¢â¢ i am going to have time enough to know about your petty affairs.
"Now there are a great many things that I am movi on this occasion.
- a stimulating sight. This golden sunshine coming down in genial, lazy
â¢â  ripened brown of these magnificent hills, â â â¢ Is me oi
â  It is more than Hellas that we have here. Greece looked out
toward the old orienta! world; Berkeley looks out through the Golden Gate
t' ward the Oriental world that has meaning for to-day. (Applause.) I should
like to talk to you about the glorious future that I discern for this university. I
should liktj to talk to you about the work we have to do here â plans we have in
band; but in the few moments that 1 have in this sup: me opportunity 1 want to
Bpeak to you about the one thing that, in my idea, is fundamental in the life of a
university, and that la university loyalty. (Applause.)
"A university is not a pla.ee where you come as empty buckets to the well
to bo filled with water or anything else. People are going to pump things into
you, to be sure, but you are going to pour most of it out again. 1 believe, from
mj ov.n experience, that after all we have to take upon ourselves the consola
tion that that does us th< most good which we forget most entirely. Those
things which hover on the superfices of the mind are oftener a stumbling block
than a help. It Is what goes over into spinal marrow, into real life, that makes?
US, and what we are going to get out of our university life is not hits of
knowledge, is not maxims and rules for getting this or that, for learning this
or that, for attaining this or that; but aft'T all It is this one thing that we
talk so much about and understand so imperfectlyâ it Is character. The men
you ti< to are men of character. As I grow older I corn.' less and less to re
spect men of brilliancy, and tie to men for their character. And what men are
going to get out of this university life is not what is pumped Into ihe pail, hut
what goes over into life. And It comes not only from the lecture room, but
from association with the best minds we find here in the student bodyâassocia
te n with the whole life and character of the university. This university Is a
living thing: the real university is alive. Blood pulses through its veins. .The
. life of the men who have gone before is in it. It is not a thing of
building, nor of statutes, nor of courses, it is a thing of life. And what you will
get out of this university that Is worth your while, that will stand by" you, is
what you will get out of association with it as a living thing.
â¢'Therefore 1 say we are not a mechanism for providing j><?op!e with equip
ment; we are alive, we have a heart. And to the. family life I charge you stu
dents of the University of California be loyal. It is worth your while. It is
your duly. Be loyal to the university. Be loyal to all its parts. Say that you
love It. Those who take the misunderstandings and the quarrels of the inside
to ventilate them In the outside world are traitors to us. (Applause.) We are
a family. You cannot ma.kc a university out of minds and brains. In a univer
sity, as elsewhere In the world, heart is more than heads, and love is more than
reason. Hold you fast to that love for this university. Stand strong, shoulder
to shoulder, when you do Its work. Let every man according to his ability do
what the university asks of him. and let every man do in support of the other
man's work what he can. Let the quarter-back pass the ball, let the line stand
solid, let the, men guard the half-back, when he cornea racing around the end.
l^et us stand toother. Let us have at the University of California what we
call In football 'good interference.'
"This university shall be a family's glorious old mother, by whose hearth you
shall love to sit down. I^ove her; it does a man good to love noble things, to'at
taob bis life to noble allegiances. It is a good thing to love the church. It is a
good tiring to lov<* the state. It is a good thing to iove one's home. It is a good
tiling to be loyal to one's father and mother, and after the same thing It is good
loyal to the university, which stands in life for the purest things and the
cleanest, loftiest ideals. Cheer for her; it will do your lung:; good.
"It has done me good to hear your cheer ringing over the campus. My little
hoy (five or six years old), who is already a loyal Californian (applause), asked
n I started to come out here please to instruct him in the California yell;
and 1. to my grent regret, was unable to give It to him In the original. He looked
vi me and shook his head, entertaining some serious doubts Whether I had any
right to be the president of the University of California. And I shared his doubts.
But wo had not been In Sun Francisco many hours when th" yell w;:s learned,
"And so 1 say cheer for her; It will do your lungs good. Love her; it will do
your heart and life pood." (Applause.)
The president's remarks were received with continued outbursts of applause.
At their conclusion Fred Dorety of the class of 1900, president of the Associated
Students, extended a welcome on behalf of the students themselves. When he
had finished President Wheeler rose once more to speak before the gathering
dispersed. He said In conclusion:
"It has been good to be hire, i thank yon. I thank yen. I thank you a
thousand times f"r your cordiality and for your welc ime. May we meet tog-ether
now In the future often to consult and to Ftlr our enthusiasm together. But now
it ha? been -good to be here, and we will go into our homes in peace."
This evening: the members of the faculty held a public reception in honor of
President ajid Mrs. Wheeler in Stiles Hall. The building was tastefully decorated
and a pupperwaspervt-i during the reception. President and Mrs. Wheeler were
introdin ed to all the members of the faculty.

LETT FOR THE EAST LAST
EVENING.
Judge Gilbert of the Circuit Court
of Appeals Handed Down Several
Opinions at the Morning
Session.
J-dircs Gilbert and Hawley sat In the
!'i ted States Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday, and after handing down three
: b written by Judge Gilbert listened
to an argument on a case then before the
court and adjourned shortly after noon
until this morning.
After the adjournment Justice McKenna
shook hands with his friends and bade
them good -by after announcing that he
\\;i? about to depart for the East on the
afternoon train.
The following opinions written by Judge
Gilbert were hanoed flown by the court:
D. R. Campbell &. Sons vs. Moran Bros.
Companyâ Judgment affirmed.
I'nltfij States of America vs. Per.umbra
Kellyâ Motion fÂ«>r ar, order recalling man
flate will be allowed.
Henry D. P. Allen vs. Charles F. Allen
and Aaron C. Allenâ Judgment affirmed.
Taxation, of Bonds.
The appellants' brief In the bond
case of the estate of the late
James G. Fair against the City and
County of San Francisco has been
filed in the Supreme Court. The As
sessor in the performance of his duties
assessed bonds of several quasi-public
corporations, which formed a goodly part '
of the estate, and the demand for' taxes
was refused. Action was begun to en
force payment, and this was contested by
the matter being taken Into the Supreme
Court. The contentions of the ropresenta- i
tlves of the estate are that bonds of rail
road corporations incorporated in this
State and operating railroads in more
than one ('.unity In this State are not as
sessable for taxes, and that bonds of
private or industrial corporations are not
: taxable.

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. H.â The disturbed condi
tion of the. foreign markets for securities and
the upward tendency of foreign discounts
caused a break in :>r!ces at the opening of
the Stock Exchange here. The selling move
ment was quite active in the first hour ami
prices for the day, in the majority, were made
In that time. There v/uh some pressure later
In the day in obscure quarters of the stock list
But prices generally were better by the end of
the first hour. In the latter part of the day
the email volume of offerings invited bidding
up of prices. The level of. many stocks was
carried above that of last night, both In the
railroad? an Industrial department. No lar^e
offerings were brought out by the advance and
even the violent upward leap In the money
rate to 40 per cent after 2 o'clock caused â .:-.:â¢.â 
a slight setback in prices. They hardened again
and the closing was very ftrm In an almost
Ftagnant market or.d only slightly below the
beet of the day. There is a mixture of gains
and losses throughout the list. Thero was con
siderable calling of loans In the early hours by
national ban! whose reserves ure below the
legal limit. But the money rate did not get
above 20 per cent during this period, and at the
opening money loaned at 6 per cent. Before tho
afternoon flurry It had falien back again to 6
jier cent. It was after 2 o'clock when the rate
spurted to 40 per cent, and then dropped back
again before the close. The urgent demand for
money seems confined to tho Stock Exchange,
ami the small disbursements created by to
day's high rate indicate row limits of need
there. Time loans, though they do not respond
to the high rates for call loans, are not offered
in large volume. Call loan rates at neighboring
financial centers wed I me deposition to ad
vance to-day, But the severe stringency j seems
confined to New York and to a narrow specu
lative circle- In the stock market.. There..is no
evidence ns yet of :my disturbance of the course
of general buHluÂ« v for lack at money. The
action of the London and Berlin markets I
and thÂ« weekly return of ' the 'lmperial Bank
of Germany indicate an urgent need for money
there Obviously no further movement of gold
to New York la to be expected in the Imme
diate future. No effect is yet apparent from
the October disbursements of dividends and in
terest, but some funds are expected to make
their way from this source Into the New York
money market before many uuys.
A hope la entertained in Btock market cir
cles that sutne measure of relief by the Treas
ury Department is Imminent, us '.:.>â  absorption
of surplus revenues is thÂ« principal cause of
exhaustion cf the local money reserve.
The bund market was dull, but prices were
lower In response to the high money rate. Tu
tal miles, p:ir value. $1,295,000.

Tho stuck market here opened weak to-day
and went flat early un the announcement of
an advance la the bank rate of discount from
SV4 to 4Vj. he advance was made by the gov
ernors of the Bank of England on their own
responsibility because of the rise In the rate
at Berlin of from 6 to 'i per cent. There was
no panic and little excitement, but It was
decidedly weak, although there was a slight
rebi.und finally.
Lord Rothschild, despite the critical state of
affairs in the Transvaal, told Ills lends this
intuiting that there would be no war. Con
sols were down to 101% lor money and 102Â»Â»
for the N. ijetiil.rr account. At th close to
day they were Wl*i for money.
Americans bepun flat and went from 'i to 1

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Oct. B.â Early Transvaal advices
contained nothing to Increase the apprehension
j of war and Wheat opened easier; December, 74*4
| Â©74?ic; May, 77%Â©77% C, Those who had rushed
i to cover during yesterday's scare sold moder-
a tely. Cables were a disappointment, Liverpool
1 being up only Vid, while consuls showed an
: advanc-f. An advance set In following a report
that -hostilities had already begun. There was
a fat runs outside demand and the early sellers
asxln bought to cover their first sales. Undor
this Impulse December ascended to 74%@74%c.
: The advance was not held long. The nervous
feeling resulted In more selling and the price
slumped to opening figures. The last advance
of the day carried December to 74% c, but this
was also lost, the price sliding off to 73% c, the
i low mark for the day, and closed at 7<c. The
i break was due largely to the big Increase In
Northwestern elevator stocks, 6,000,000 bushels,
compared with 3,493,000 increase In September
of. last year. The announcement of this served
â¢ a? a signal for a lot of selling and the war
news for the time being was Ignored.
Corn held strong the greater part of the day
altected principally by the Transvaal political
crisis. December closed at 30Vi@30%0.
Oats held firm, influenced less by war newÂ«
and break less severely on the turns. De
cember closed at 23VÂ«c.

London Wool Sales.
LONDON, Oct. 3.â The offerings at the wool
auction pales to-day amounted to 10,743 bales.
The tone was steady, with prices ruling at the
late decline. Medium coarse stocks were rather
easier. The recent Blackening In the demand
Is attributed to manufacturers having filled
their requirements. The prospects of dearer
money Is causing many merchants and specu
lators to suspend operations for the time be
in*. Scoured merinos were taken chiefly by
the home trade. Many bales of medium New
South Wales and Queensland were withdrawn.
Locks and pieces were easily disposed of at
a very small decline. Greasy merinos Bold
steadily to French and German buyers. Cross
breda were In large supply, and as the qual
ity was fine competition was spirited. Medium
greasy was Irregular, owing to the withdrawal
of American support. Cearse stock was taken
principally by the home trade at prices on a
level with yesterday's decline. Sllpes were
largely withdrawn.

WHEATâ future market fell back In
sympathy with a decline at Chicago. Spot quo
tations remained unchanged.
Chicago opened easier on large receipts and
latter market were 1 higher, as well ac at
Paris. There were more buyers than sellers,
however, at the decline. War rumors kept the
market nervous and unsettled. Later on good
speculative buying developed, and there was
a phenomenal demand for cash corn. Still ;
later the market turned weak, the outside buy
ing subsiding and the local crowd being over
loaded. In addition St. Louis turned seller on
a large scale and It was learned that Northwest
county elevator stocks Increased 4,00u,00u bush
els in September. ,

Harrison's circular says: "Since the AJa
nieda left the following cargoes of Australian
coal have been delivered here, viz: Dv Gues
clin. 2198 tons; General de Charette, 3058 tons;
Port Patrick, 2726 tons; Sea King, 2160 tons;
total, 10,142 tons. There are In the engagement
list twenty-one vessels, loading and afloat, with
a. capacity of about GO.fcQQ tons; of these only
three lire due this month, hence the stock on
hand i.f Australian will become almost nil
next month. Colonial fuel is being displaced
by our local coast collieries, as the cost de
livered here of the former Is too high, although
i the coals from Newcastle are very popular with
' some consumers, but the deliveries for the past
j Fix months nre diminishing, and are too spas
i modic and Irregular. The prevailing freight
I rates and the high cost of coal at Sydney and
Newcastle make shipments almost prohibitory.
The exceptional dralt this year from Australia
for the Honolulu market hay diverted vessels
1 from thin port, and has forced freights up,
1 so that tonnage for here Is absolutely unob
â  tamable at covering rates. This rush of fuel
, to Honolulu will diminish materially in the
I next nix months, as the moving of troops to
! the front must ease off before that time, and
transport! will be gradually dropped out of
I the service. A number of these same steamers
â  will eventually drift Into coal carrying on the
; coast here, and freights will decline in that
line In 1900, pay about twelve months hence."

CONTINUED ACTIVITY WITH FIRM
PRICES EVERYWHERE.
The Pacific Coast Wood and Iron for Octo
ber says:
"Redwood has not been quite as active dur
ing the past month as In August, but the fall
ing off has not been very noticeable. The re
ceipts have not been as heavy In September,
but It Is always the case each year In this
month. Pine, spruce and fir have held their
I own, and the lumber business, both from a
| retail and wholesale point of view, is extreme
ly healthy and progressive. This is for San
Francisco and the near-by vicinities along and
across the bay.
"In Northern California the most encourag
ing activity is reported. The mining Interests
are making heavy demands for suitable tim
ber, and several large log drives have been
accomplished to meet the orders. Building is
going on rapidly and the evidences of agricul
tural prosperity are seen on all skies. In Hum- 1
i boidt and Mendocino counties the mills are I
j rushed with foreign and domestic orders.
"In the southern part of California reports
i show an ever-increasing lumber business. Or
ders are frequent and heavy, but difficulty is
experienced, as in the past months of 1899, in
getting suitable vessels for the southern route.
To offset this drawback, the local San Fran
cisco, Eureka and Northwestern shipyards are
busy with a number of new schooners. These
may neutralize the scarcity, but more vessels
I will be needed before long.
"In the Pacific Northwest the lumber busi
ness has never been better. The market Is nor
mal and healthy in Its evidences. Portland.
Or., is turning out about 850,000 feet of lumber
per day. Prices are advancing with the in
crease of demands and the present 'wave of
prosperity is carrying the lumber manufac- j
turers and dealers along at a merry rate.
Great scarcity of logs is the heaviest drawback,
and logging outfits are running on a scale I
never heard of before.
"In Washington every department of the lum
her market is happy. The foreign and Fast
cm shipments are growing and show heavier
exports than for years gone by. The Puset
Sound lumbermen see a bright future In the
Hawaiian Island trade. The Puget Sound lum
ber has secured a firm foothold in Hawaii, and
it is expected the. trade will grow to enormous
proportions with the growth of the islands.
"All in all, the coast lumber interests feel
like according a Dewey celebration to the firm
and steady condition of the lumber trade and
the advent of even better times."

MANY SCHEMES
PROPOSED FOR
WELL TESTING
Board of Works Not
in Need of Advice.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 3.
The Board of Pui "â¢ lea will haw
plenty of facilities offered !t for the pur
pose of testing the artesian wells at Rob
erts Landing. Now that it is known that
the Council Is very much in earnest in
the matter and is prepared to expend
money In the making of tests and the
purchase of the necessary machinery,
many people anxious to submit schemes
are appearing at the City Hall. The board
in any event must advertise for bids, and
so all the experimentalists will have an
equal chance to demonstrate their
schemes.
There Is likely to be a little difference
of opinion regarding the purchase of a
special brand of air pump to make the
test, as desired by Mr. Cuvelller. When
spoken to about the matter to-day the
Mayor said that it might not be necessary I
to make a purchase, but that probably one
might be hired for the seventy-two hours
dining which the test is to be maintained.
The ordinance authorizing the Board of
Works to expend $1200 to make the test '
of the capacity of the wells doc-s not cun
tain anything about the use of the air '
t^st machinery, and should the board
think some other test preferable there
may be a valuable pump on hand as a
memento of the friction between ;he |
Board of Works and the Council.
Mayor Snow says that the board will
certainly see that the tests are made as
economically as possible, and that it the
pump be not the best method it will not
be bought.

pany to supply the plaintiff with water
and pay the costs of suit, but declines to

CUVELLIER WORKS ON
WHILE OTHERS APPROVE
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Councilman Cuvelller Is in earnestâ desperately
In earnest. He admits thai all his spare moment? during the day and
the wakeful hours at night are given dp to the study of the best man
ner to obtain municipal ownership of waterworks. Last night was Mr.
Cuve-llier's busy session. With the aid of a batch of resolutions, ordinances
and communications he abandoned one plan and started another. Instead of
allowing the Board of Works unlimited discretion and $1500, he killed that
measure indefinitely and provided another plan. The speed with which he
ran a good-natured Council for about fifteen minutes was amazing. He passed
two resolutions, killed another, read a report on the contour of the county,
filed an extension of an option on property, met all arguments, wiped the
perspiration from his brow and sat downâ all in fourteen minutes and some
seconds.
Nobody but Cuvellier could have half-contracted for the purchase of a
test-pump and passed his ordinance under suspension of the rules. Somehow
the intrepid man of the glasses and small stature has won the confidence of
his brethren, and they are quite willing to let him go ahead. If Oakland
shall ever acquire her own water plant, Cuvellier will not be forgotten and
he will certainly not miss his great ambition if energy and sincerity will dolt

CHARGED WITH FORGERY.
Harry Roberts Arrested at His Home
in Peatlands.
SANTA ANA, Oct. 3.â Harry Roberts,
who recently arrived at the home of his
father In Peatlands, this county, was
last night arrested here on a telegram
from the Sheriff of Nez Perce County,
Idaho who holds a warrant for the arreet
of Roberts for forgery. Roberts is said to
have forged the name of A. C. Davidson
of I>ewlston, Idaho, and thereby secured
a large sum of money, with which he fled
to Portland Or., and thence here. A pic
ture and description, received here last
night procured Roberts' arrest less than

Roberts' father and other relatives are
making Btrenuous efforts to compromise
the matter by wiring Idaho parties their
willingness to refund the money secured
by the forgery, but no arrangement look-

MRS. BARNES BY
A BUNGLE MAY
BE A BIGAMIST
Was Wedded in Ne
vada Prematurely.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.-The matrimonial
proclivities of Mrs. Beatrice A. Barnes of
this city have led that lady into a most
remarkable as well as a thoroughly un
comfortable position according to her ex
husband's attorney. In the eyes of the
law Mrs. Barnes is an i/inocent bigamist,
though the intent of crfme is absent. In
her own opinion, at least until she hears
of her mistake, she is the Nevada-made
bride of Edward H. McNevin of 618 Eighth
street, a teacher who is employed in a
navigation school in San Francisco. Mrs.
Barnes' trouble was caused by a short
but misleading paragraph in a local paper.
Until Mr. McNevin and Mrs. Barnes
took a hurried trip to Reno the story [a
extremely prosaic. Mrs. Barnes was sued
for divorce some time ago through K. B.
Myers, the attorney of her complaining
husband, James A. Barnes. The ground
was infidelity, and since Mrs. Barnes did
not answer the charge, in which Mr. Mc-
Nevin'a name was mentioned prominently,
Mr. Barnes looked for no difficulty in the
way of securing his freedom. The news
of the decree of the divorce which had
been so eagerly looked for by both Mr.
B ;t:;<l i.is wife was published the
&th. It was the signal at once of another
hymeneal venture on the part of Mr*.
Banns, who, after a little preparation,
left fur Nevada with Mr. where
a Justice of : '..<â  Peace forged the welcome
bonds. Then the;, returned to Oakland
and Mr. McNevin went back to the
schoolroom.
Now, however, comes the legal aspect
that turns Mrs. Barnes' hopes to ashes.
The fact that v decree was granted was
not a fact. It was instead the mistake of
a reporter, who in looking over the docket
took down Mra Barnes' default as a de
cree, and thus printed it. Mrs. Barnes,
reading it. concluded that she was free
imparted the glad tidings to her second
and-to-be, and !eft for the Silver
State with him bet' ire convincing herself
that she was divorced in truth. The Ne
vada ceremony, therefore, makes Mrs.
Barnes the wife of two men. a fact of
which up to this morning she was una
ware.

ACT OF ENEMIES
OF SALOON MEN
IS DEPRECATED
Giant Powder Used as
Argument.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Oct. 3.
Borge & Cahill's saloon, in Niles Can
yon, was blown up early this morning,
and Jack Cahill, who was sleeping on the
premises, nearly lost his life. It is be
lieved that the act was committed by
some one who resented the carrying on
of a saloon business by the proprietors In
the canyon.
The giant powder, which It Is believed
was used to demolish the saloon, was
placed under the corner farthest from the
little bedroom where Cahill was sleeping,
and this saved his life. The explosion wai
very severe, and half of the board shanty
and all the contents were completely
wrecked. Cahill was stunned by the
shock and did not recover consciousness
for half an hour. As soon as he was able
he aroused the night watchman and made
an investigation. They could find nothing
that might serve as a clew, and they at
once went into Niles and reported the
matter to the Constable. Cahill had some
suspicions about the matter which he told
the officers, but they led to nothing defi
nite.
For about a month there has been
trouble over the saloon of Borge & Cahill.
The license was granted and revoked. A
protest was made against it. and the pro
testants should have been heard yester
day. To the surprise of everybody. Su
perUsors Church. Roeth and Wells voted
to grant the license without waiting to
hear the protestants.
Deputy Constable George Wales was
j sent out by Sheriff Rogers to make an '.n
-vt-stiKution. He returned this evening, but
liad not obtained any information that
would lead to th* arrest of the miscreant.
[ndlgnatlon is very high at both Niles and
Sunol, and all sorts of opinions are ex
pressed as to the origin of the explosion.

ENTERPRISE OF WATER
FRONT IS EXPANDING
OAKLAND. Oct. 3.â A contract, of con
siderable note from a commercial point of
view, calling for an extension of 600 feet
of Balfour, Guthrie & Co.'s bulkhead at
the foot of Myrtle street, has been re
corded, for which work Johnson & Peter
eon are to receive $4 30 per foot to be
completed within thirty days.
A contract has also been iet to F. H.
Moscow to build a trestle and warehouse
for Balfour, Guthrie & Co. for $34 449
Work on the big grain warehouse just
south of First street has been somewhat
retarded owing to difficulty in gettine
lumber. Jt is probable that when the
first big vessel comes up the creek to be
loaded with grain for Liverpool the event
will be made the occasion for some kind
of public demonstration. Balfour Guthrie
& Co.'s undertaking is one of the most
important Oakland has experienced in
many a day.

EIGHT candidates for office at the
hands of the voters of Kan Fran
cisco Â»re nominated last nlprht
by the Republican Municipal Con
vention held at Odd Fellows'
Hall. A platform was unanimously In
doreed breathing fealty to the principles
of the. party and declaring for the rights
of labor and against religious tests of
citizenship; for public ownership of
Utilities; for a dollar limit of taxation on
O. valuation of $375,000,000; for the re
ference of bond Issues for public im
provements to the voters; for good
schools, competition in street lighting and
In other j.-Ã¼blic contracts; and pledging
all the nominees of the convention to
carry out all the provisions of the new
charter.
All this was r.ot done without consider
able excitement, one mostly to the en

Forty-fourth Assembly District to I

when he put in nomination for Public

Drinkhousc, whoso attorney he happens
to be.
The friends of Prinkhouse had gone Into
the Republican caucus to select nominees,
:ng to abide by the decision of trie
rity. The caucus had decided that
it wanted Captain John Farnham us its
nominee for Public Administrator, and the
quence was that Kuef, who has
what of a record as a bolter, was
displeased. He started the ball of his dis
ire rolling early last night, as one
delegate put It. "with a threat in one
and an offer in the other," for his
own particular purpose. That purpose

Sid not propose to be disappointed in hav

As soon as Mr. Cerf was disposed of
Chairman H. S. Hubbard read the report
of the committee on order of business,
â which recommended that nominations be

The first sensation of the evening was
pprunp by Delegate A. Ruef of the Thlrty
peventn. He offered an amendment to the
committee's report, and in a heated speech
attacked the order of business as pre
sented by the committee and the work. of
the Grand Hotel caucus. His amendment
read:
â  The order of business at this convention shall
be as follow*:
1. Reception of report of committee on per
manent organization and order of business, and
action thereon. â¢ .': . 'â¢:
2. Reception of report of committee on plat

SOME SIDELIGHTS OIN THE CONVENTION.
A PLATFORM OF PRINCIPLES.
TO the Republican Municipal convention
of the City and County if San Franciscoâ
Your committee on platform and reso
lutions begs leave to report the following: plat
form and resolutions and recommends their
adoption:
Resolved. That we. the delegated representa
tives of the Republican party of the city and
county of San Francisco, in municipal oon
ventlon Resembled this third day of October,
]Sh9, In the discharge of the obligations we owe
to our constituents and cur city, declare our
principles and purposes as follows:
1. That we reaffirm our adherence and fidel
ity to the principles of the Republican party
as embodied In its history a.nd expressed In
its rlitformsâ State and national.
'i. That we have l'alth in tha wisd patriot-
Ism and policy of the administration of Presi
dent McKinley and conflder.ee that the game,
will result In the honor, prosperity and glory,
I of the whole country, and particularly of our
city and State.
3. That the thanks of the people are due to
the soldiers and sailors of the array and navy
who have won Imperishable glory en land and
tea In the late war axainst Spanish tyranny.
We honor the California Volunteers who have
periled their lives in defense of the country
end in vindication of the honor of its flaij and
have added new luster to the history of our
{calls, nt State. The country owes to them somo
permanent recognition of their patriotism and
valor, and ample provision for those of their
survivors who have received disabling and
honorable wounds in the service of their coun
try; and that the heroes who have fallen In
Us defend shall Lie held in grateful and last
ing remembrance.
4. The present administration of the State
government has been honest and economical
aDd as bucl) Is entitled to the confidence and
approval of the people.
I. That we are In favor of the enforcement
of the n^w charter for the government of the
city and county of San Francisco, according
to its letter and spirit, and wÂ» pledge the nom
inees of this convention to a conscientious anJ
honest endeavor to bo enforce and carry Into
effect all Its -provisions
6. And especially do we declare In favor of
the acquisition of all public utilities in ac
cordance with the provisions of article XII
of the new charter, and we pledge our nominee
for Mayor and our nominees for the Board of
Supervisors .to that policy. Until that result
is accomplished, we pledge our nominees for
Supervisors to fix within the time prescribed
by law a water rate which will net the Spring
Valley Water Company not more than 5 pÂ«r
cent en its reasonable and legitimate capitali
zation, provided that the operating and con
struction expenses of the corporation be re
duced to an amount that is fair, just and
equitable. To that end we pledge our nominees
to make a careful and methodical Investiga
tion of the books of the company.
7. That the present system of street lighting
should be Improved and extended throughout
the outlying districts. The charge for gas and
electric lights should be reduced and the qual
ity Improved. The lighting of the city's streets
constitutes a large and necessary Item of pub
lic expense. "Wo. favor legislation that will en
courage fair competition for this contract and
secure to the public the maximum of efficient
service at the . minimum of expense. In this,
as in other matters involving the expenditure
of public money, . we are opposed to discrimi
nation In the award of public contracts.
8. "We are In favor of the present ordinance
for the removal .of poles and placing under
ground all electric wires within the district
prescribed by said ordinance, and demand of
our nominees an honest and determined' effort
to secure such a result.
9. We believe in the administration of gov
ernmentâFederal, State and municipal â
cording to the same rigid rules of economy and
honesty that business men observe in the con
duct of their own private affairs. Conducted
on these principles a tax of one dollar on each
hundred dollars, based on an assessed valua
tion of *S7r,.GC<>.>)oo. will be sufficient to properly
administer the municipal government. We
therefore demand of our candidates for the
office- of Supervisors a pledge that they shall
limit the annual tax levy to an amount not
exceeding that which will be produced by a
tax levy of one dollar on every hundred dollars
of assessed valuation not exceeding 1375, 000, (W0.
i 10. As the maximum amount which may be
raised by the tax levy aforesaid will not all be
required for the administration of the city gov
ernment under the new charter we pledge our
' candidates for Mayor and Supervisors to con
! duct said government In an economical manner
' and to expend the surplus in permanent Im
provements, which Improvements shall be spe
j cifically 1 provided for each year in the annual
tax levy The funds set aside for Improvements
: ttha.ll not be diverted or used for any other
' purpose.
San Francisco that regularly elected dole- i
gates have not been permitted to confer j
with other regularly elected delegates on |
the order of business. I expect, by my
statement, to show my reason for asking
a vote in favor of the" propositions that I
shall urge upon you this evening. I have
placed.. the selection of these officers who
have not been selected by a certain cau
cus of this convention before another cau
cus ran be hold and shut out from
the consideration of those names. I have ]
put next the selection of a county com- j
! mittee, because it has not been passed on |
i by the caucus. 1 made the motion in this j
, form because somebody might move to i
! have my report laid on tho table. I wish I
; to know whether the county committee
j shall be selected by regularly appointed
i delegates or by delegates from other dlt>
j tricts. who have been repudiated and who
' have been foisted upon us. I want it de
i termined here and now whether this pri- j
| mary law, which I had a hand in making,
i was a false pretense to the public or
whether It means eometblng different in a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 4. 1899.
11. We further pledge our candidates for
Mayor and Supervisors to submit to the voters
the question or Issuing bonds for such neces
sary Improvements a.Â« cannot be provided for
by the annual tax levy under the charter's dol
lar limit.
12. We pledge our nominees for the Board of
Supervisors, sitting as a Board of Equalization,
and our nominee for Assessor to the levying
and adjustment of all assessments upon an ab
solutely fair and equitable basis. We Insist
that aa between rich and poor, corporation and
private citizen there shall be no discrimination;
that the burdens of government shall be borne
In equal proportion by all classes, and that the
value of corporal franchises should be as
sessed by deducting- the value of the entire
tangible property of such corporations from
the market value of their Ktocks and bonds.
13. The Republican party pledges Itself to
place our public schools in the highest state of
efficiencyâ educationally and financially. We
declare that it la the policy of the Republican
party of the city and county of San Francisco
that the Superintendent of Common Schools
and the Bourd of Education shall dispense with
all unncetsury text books and make no unnec
essary changes In text books, and that all nec
essary supplies shall be furnished to the pupils.
Including text books to Indigent children, free
of charge; that the sanitary condition of our
schools should be Improved and new buildings
conrtructed where neoesaary at the earliest
possible period; that all contracts shall be sub
ject to fair competition after advertisement for
public bids; and that the funds of the School
Department shall be handled with the most
rigid economy.
14. That we are in favor of providing the
means for the payment of the overdue salaries
of the teachers of the School Department; that
the arles of teachers and other employes of
the School Department should be paid oh or
before the 6th day of every month and before
any school Indebtedness Is Incurred on other
accounts; that the County Auditor shall annu
ally segregate so much of the common school
fund -is shall bo sufficient to pay the salaries
of the teachers In the School Department, and
pueh sums shall not bo diverted or used for any
ether purpose. :i â â¢â â¢
16. The Republican party has always been the
champion o. labor and the advocate of protec
tion to the Industrial classes. We pledge our
nominees In every department of the municipal
government to the use of the Allied Printing
Trades Council Isabel, as registered with tho
Secretary of State on all printing for municipal
use.
18. Kicht hours shall be the maximum hours
of labor or service required of all laborers In
the service of the city and county and the min
imum of waEee of such laborers shall not be
less than two dollars a day; and the nominees
of this convention for Supervisors shall stand
pledged to this provision.
17. The Republican party liÂ» re by declares
Knelt In favor of all uuch measures an are nec
essary to protect whlto labor against Chinese
competition. The employment of white labor
and the ÃBe of California materials should be
made conditions of all public franchises.
16. No bill for the grant of any franchise
shall be put upon Its final passage within
ninety days after its introduction and no fran
chise Fliall be renewed before one year prior
to its expiration.
19. We favor the conduct of the public pound
on lust and humane principles and pledge our
nominees for Supervisors to make all necessary
rules and regulations to that end. The present
control of that Institution by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animate has been
eminently satisfactory.
20. We recommend the establishment of a
new and sanitary system of sewerage, In order
to Improve the general sanitary condition of
the city, and to that end all necessary pro
visions should be made for Immediately pro
ceeding with the construction of the best mod
ern-made sewers and sewer outlets as may be
deemed Imperatively necessary, and pledge our
candidates for Mayor and Board of Supervisors
to employ their best efforts to that end.
21. We Indorse the provisions of the new
charter as prescribed by article VI In relation
to the charge; superintendence and control of
our public ways, streets, sewers, etc.. by the
Board of Public Works, under such ordinances
as may tram time to time be adopted by the
Board of Supervisors.
22. All cobble pavements In the business por
tions of the city, and particularly In the dis
trict north of Pine street and east of Kearny,
should be replaced with modern pavements
constructed in the most substantial manner at
the earliest possible period of time and a sys
tematic plan be pursued for Improving other
pavements in bad condition as rapidly as the
funds will permit. Specifications for paving
should be so framed as to admit of asphalt,
vitrified brick, wooden blocks and any other
desirable materials used at present, and all
specifications should require that guarantees
convention; whether it was proper to run
a blanket ticket for the county committee
and to run the business of the Republicnn
party and shut out us delegates, who have
the same right, morally and otherwise, to
be here. I say. gentlemen, you are facing
a crisis in the history of the Republican
party. While the county committee does
not amount to much, yet it will establish
a principle. It im-nns the destruction of
the Republican party. And I say now, if
that is the kind of Republicanism you
gentlemen wish to foist upon vs â to "ex
pect me and fourteen other delegates to
stand and say, we have no voice in a
convention pledged to carry out certain
dictationsâ'
Delegate Tauszky of the Fortieth
raised the point that the original report
contained no provision as to the manner
of selecting the county committee, and
therefore Ruef's amendment specifying
the mode and method of its appointment
was out of order. The chair ruled
against the point.
â  A little fuel was added to the fire by
be given for the maintenance of the pavements
for a period of not lees than ten years.
23. We pledge our candidates for Supervisors
not to Errant any permit or franchise to any
railroad company to operate street railroads
through any densely populated portion at the
city. We further pledge them to use all Just |
and local measures to secure the speedy re
moval of any objectionable steam railway
tracks running through the Mission district to
the county line.
34. We recommend also that plans be pre
pared and proceedings instituted for the con
struction and acquisition at an early date of
a salt water pumping plant and reservoir for
supplying salt water for flushing: sewers and
other purposes where practicable.
25. The telephone service of our city has bo
come a necessity to our people and the privi
leges granted to the telephone companies have
been liberal and (if (Treat value. In return for !
these privileges we demand that said tele-phone
companies furnish free service to the city and
reduce the rate to our citizens.
it. The Coroner's office and the Morgue should
be conducted in such a manner as to show a
decent respect for the dead and a. proper con
sideration for the feelings of the bereaved
relatives and friends. To this end we pledge
our nominee for Coroner to employ a matron
for attendance upon female cases; to conduct
Inquests when practicable at the place* des
ignated by the relatives or friends of the de
ceased, and to abolish the practice of making
certain .undertaking establishments active
agents for carrying out the duties of the
office,
27. Wo fa -or such legislation nnd all other
legitimate measures that may be necessary or
expedient to protect the Inhabitants of our I
city against the manufacture and pale of adul- !
terated foods.
IS. We declare that In appointments to po
litical offices no distinction should be made
as to creed or color, and further affirm that j
the colored racÂ» deserves and should receive
proper reeoirnHirn from the Republican party.
29. We commend the administration of our
Police and Fire departments and pledge our
nominee for Mayor and our nominees fcr tho
Board of Supervisors to support all measures
prescribed by the new charter and calculated
to Increase the efficiency of those Important
branches of the municipal government.
30. We favor the construction of a new City
and County Hospital, pursuant to the most j
modern planÃ for Institutions of that kind; i
and also Fire Department buildings and equip- |
ments In such outside districts as are In need
of them and without fire protectiono.
81. Our candidate for Mayor Is hereby pledged
to appoint as civil service commissioners only
public-spirited citizens who are known to be !
devoted to civil service principles, and our
candidate for Mayor and our candidates for nil
other offices are pledged to strictly and Im- |
partially enforce the provisions of article XIII I
upon civil service in the new charter.
?2. We denounce and condemn the nefarious i
system practiced by some of our city and i
county officers by which employes under their
. control are compelled to pay a certain percent
age of their salaries as compensation for se
curing or retaining their positions, and wo
pledge our nominoes, If elected, to refrain from
direct or Indirect participation In such prac
tice.
33. The Republican party bolleves In liberty,
equality and law; In the sovereignty of the
people ond In the government by and for the
people through their chosen representative and :
according to the constitution; It believes in
personal Independence; in universal religious
liberty; In the dignity of labor; In obedience
to the laws; In electing only the best men to
office. We believe, and it is one of the car
dinal principles of the Republican faith, that
every American citizen within the Jurisdiction
of our government shall (If he wish) exercise
his constitutional prerogative to cast his vote
at every election, whether It be a national.
State, municipal or, the most important of
all. a primary election, free and untrammeled,
for the delegates or candidates of his choice,
and to have that vote honestly counted; and, j
therefore, we, the representatives of these I
vita! principles, of American citizenship, de- |
clare It to be our unalterable purpose to main- i
tain, uphold and support the new primary elec
tion law, passed by a Republican Legislature,
approved by a Republican executive and faith
fully enforced by a Republican Registrar.
34. No person shall become the candidate of ;
this convention unless he shall wholly and |
without reservation Indorse the principles and
purposes declared In this platform. And we |
invite all patriotic citizens to unite with us |
In the accomplishment of the objects nnd pur
poses above set forth, fully believing that the
exigencies of good government will be best
subserved by the election of the candidates
of this convention. Respectfully submitted.

dictates of their own confidences, irrespective
of said unit rule.
Delegate Bradford of the Fortieth
raised the point of order that Ruef stated
as facts conditions that did nut exist.
The chairman agreed with Bradford and
ruled Kuef oui of order.
This finally disposed of the tilt over
the order of business and tho platform,
was read by Chairman Sehell.
Kuef proved that he was still in the
fight as Boon as the reading of the plat
form was concluded, lit.: introduced a
resolution, which was accepted as part of
the platform committee's report. It reads:
This convention unalterably reiterates the
strongest principle of the Republican party,
"Equal rights to every citizen," and is un
qualifiedly opposed to all religious intolerance
!:: politics and public affairs, as well as in
private life; to all exclusion of citizens from
public office "r public employment, or oppo
sition to them, on any motives whatsoever
based upon their religious belief, and denounces
as un-American and un-Kepubliean any and
every combination or organization whose
basis of political existence rents upon religious
b'gotry, fanaticism, proscription and Intoler
ance.
We affirm our allegiance to the constitution
and laws of our great nation, the chief Jewel
uf whose crown has evt-r been its freedom uf
religious worship and Its acknowledgment of
ual rights of all its citizens, irrespective
of their religious belief.
W. EL K. McMartin introduced a resolu
tion on the Philippine question. A point
was made that the subject was one out-
Hide tlio jurisdiction of a municipal con
vention. Delegate Schell thought the
plank Indorsing President McKlnley's pol-
Icj covered the subject fully. I. J. Tru
man Jr. and Waills Bradford urged the
adi ption of the McMartin resolution.
T. S, Sergeant was cruelly treated when
)i>- attempted i'> register a protest agiunst
sing the Philippine policy of tho ad
mlnistration. He said while he was a
thorough Republican he was not afraid
to say that In this connection President
McKlnley had made a mist.-uke. and that
when we started the war we had declared
that the acquisition of territory was not
our object. The declaration was the sig
nal for boisterous interruptions of the
ker. The chair lost control of the
ntion and for a time pandemonium
reigned. Quiet was not restored until
.nit gave up In disgust and sat down.
The McMartin resolution was then
adopted. It is as follows:
That we have faith in the wisdom, patriotism
and policy oi Pri - l< at McKlnlej and have con
fldence that the name will result In the honor,
prosperity and glory of the whole country ami
particularly ot our city and State. And we
heartily indorse the policy of tlie present
administration regarding our new pow â 
In the Philippine archipelago, and the inhabit
ants thereof. That the fortunes ar.d necessi
ties growing out of the war waged by the
United States against Spain laid upon our Oov
nt an obligation solemn In its character,
and lmperatU'e in Its nature to protect and
safeguard the llvta and property of all citi
zens and reeidenta uf the territory which came
under Its dominion, either through purchase
from Spain or as the direct result of the gran i
achievements of our brave soldiers and sailors.
Tnat the full and faithful discharge of such
obligation required the complete submission of
the Inhabitants of all such territory to the
lawful authority ot the United States, and that
-of nJ lute ne easlty, as in that of the
Filipino Insurgents, the use of 9uch force as
iry to biinc about such submission is
fully Justified, to the end th;it a liberal, stable
and progressive government may be established
aniung them under such conditions and with
llmitatl ins and restrictions as a wise
policy may dictate, having regard at all times
for tho rights of mankind and the welfare of
humanity.
That the unpatriotic and un-American criti
cism of the President and national administra
tion for the policy pursued toward the Inhab
itants of our new territorial possessions, par
ticularly the Filipinos, Is unwarranted and un
just and calculated to cripple and hinder the
Government In the work of publication and es
tablishment of government.
Ruef Introduced a resolution commend
ing the course and administration of the
present Republican county oflleials. It
was lost in a storm of noes.
Nominations for Auditor were called for
and Delegate L. L. Solomons took the
platform and placed A>a R. "Wells in
nomination. lie s^aid the office was, next
to that of Mayor, one of the most im
portant in the municipality; that it re
quired a man of sagacious judgment and
well versed In business affairs. He then
went on to outline his candidate's record
and commended hi c . honesty and watch
fulness while in ofl|ce â how he stood by
the school teachers of this city and pro
tected them from the attacks of unscrup
ulous men. At tlie conclusion of his eu
logy the delegates greeted his name with
cheers. 1. J. Truman Jr. seconded the
nomination and added his mei-J of praise
to what had already been said. Nomi
nations for Auditor having closed, Asa
R. Wells was nominated by acclamation.
Before other nominations could be made
Ruef was to the front again with another
resolution. He said It was In the Inter
ests of disposing of the convention's busi
ness without delay. The resolution:
Resolved, The secretary of this convention
C&itt its ballot for the following candidates as
nominees of this convention, and at his leisure
collect from each $10, to wit: Treasurer, IjOUIs
Feusier; Recorder, W. 1). Tiffany; Coroner, A.
D. McLean; County Clerk, William A. Oeane;
Public Administrator, John Farnham; Tax
Collector, J. Harry Scott; Sheriff, John Lack
mann; Assessor, Albert Heyer; District At
torney, A. P. Black.
The point was made that an order of
business had been adopted, and that it
would have to be followed. Ruef moved
the suspension of the order of business
and the adoption of his resolution. On
the ground that it embodied two subjects
under one motion, it wa.s ruled out of or
der. Ruef then went at the subjects one
at a time. Delegate Tauszky of tho For
tieth District wanted to know it if was
the intention of .some of the delegates to
turn the convention into a roaring farce.
Cries of "Yes!" "Yes!" from the rear of
the hal! was the answer to the delegate's
Query. Ruef's motion went down in an
avalanche of noes.
Louis Peusier, nominated for Treasurer
by Charles J. King and seconded by F.
A. Denicke, was selected for that office by
acclamation.
Delegate King bobbed up again when
nominations for Assessor were called and
named Albert Heyer for that honor. The
secretary cast the vote of the convention.
Delegate T. P. Haynes nominated Jo
seph H. Scott for the office of Tax Col
lector and he was chosen by acclamation
to represent the party on the ticket.
W. Z. Tiffany was placed in nomination
for the office of Recorder by Leon E.
Prescott. J. W. Bird and Max Goldberg
seconded the nomination of Mr. Tiffany
and the secretary of the convention cast
Us unanimous vote for the candidate.
Delegate Cerf moved for an adjourn
ment until Thursday night. Ruef amend
ed tho motion by moving that the con
vention adjourn .until to-night. Attorney
Haynes was ready with an amendment to
Ruef's amendment, but it was ruled out
of order. Delegate Hazell moved
that Mr. Ruef's amendment be laid on
the table. The motion prevailed and
nominations for City and County Attor
ney were netft taken up. L. L. Solomons
placed Charles H. Jackson In nomination
which was made by acclamation. Dele
gate Schaertzer named Alfred P. Black
for the office of District Attorney. Secre
tary Wilson cast the vote of the conven
tion for the candidate.
When nominations for Public Adminis
trator were called Delegate Ruef took the
platform and nlacfid John A. Drinkhousw

in nomination. He said he had not in
tended nominating any person for any of
fice, but he thought it his duty to name
him for the consideration of the dele
gates. He said he arose to make the nom
ination and sacrifice $10. He called atten
tion to the report of a statement made by
Judge Schell, in which the latter is pur
ported to have said that the office of
Public Administrator had been wretch
edly conducted. Attorney Ruef said that
he had received Judge Sehell's promise
that he would correct the statement,
which he stated was untrue. In conclud
ing the speaker appealed for a roll call,
as he was desirous of seeing how many
were loyal to Mr. Drinkhouse.
In placing Captain Farnham in nomina
tion Judge Bchell corrected the impression
that had gone forth that he had paid any
thing derogatory to Mr. Drinkhouse. The
nominations having closed the convention
proceeded to a vote. -Â«*_._Â»
When the Thirty-third District was
called William MeNamara, who repre
sented himself to be chairman of the dele
gation, announced 17 votes for Dnnk
hous" This was immediately challenged
by the friends of Farmim and a scene of
disorder followed. MeNamara attempted
to explain the absence of a number of his
delegation, but he was constantly Inter
rupted Chairman Kellogg ordered the
roll of the delegation called, but as the
name of each delegate was called a vote
for Drinkhouse was recorded. Objections
to the vote were made and chaos reigned.
The delegation was passed as no satisfac
tory vote could be taken. After that each
delegation was compelled to stand as its
vote was taken. The vote resulted in
John Farnham receiving 22<i 6-7 votes and
John A. Drinkhouse 7S 2-7. Chairman Kel
logg then announced Mr. Farnham to be
the nominee of the convention for that
office
The convention then adjourned to meet
to-morrow evening in B'nai B'rith Hall.
