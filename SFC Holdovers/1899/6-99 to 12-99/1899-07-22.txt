worth. Th 3 man. his life and his work
will be widely ?nd variously dis

MEW" YORK, July 21.â Colonel
Robert G. [ngersoll died at his
home. : n-on-Hudson, . near
Dobbs Ferry, to-day. His death
was sudden and unexpected an '.
resulted from the heart disease from
which he had suffered since 1896. P.*.
â¦hat year, .during the Republican .Na
tional Convention, he was taken ill and
had to return home. He never fully re
covered from the attack of heart .dis
ease and was tinder th- care of physi
clans constantly. -
For th-" iast three days Colonel In
gersoll has not been feeling well. Last
night he was in better health and
spent a portion of the evening playing
billiards with Walston H. Brown, his
son-in-law. and C. P. Farrell. his
brother-in-law and private secretary.
He cr-cmed to. be in better health and
spirits when he retired than he had
been for several lays.
This morning he arose at the usual
hour ar.d joined the family at break
fast. He then said he had spent a bad
night, but felt better. He had been suf
fering from abdominal pains and tight
ness about the ches;. He did not think
his condition at all dangerous. After
breakfast he telephoned to Dr. Smith,
his physician, who is at haven, and
told him of his â  experience during
the night. Dr. Smith told him to
continue the u?.^ of nitro-glycerine and
that he would see him during the day.
Colonel ingers< ill spent the morning
swinging in a hammock and sitting mi
the veranda with the members of the
family. He said he was better and had
no pain. At 12:30 he started to go up
stairs.
On reaching the head of the stairs
Colonel Ingersoll turned into his wife's
room. Mrs. Ingersoll was there. To
gether they discussed what. they would
have for luncheon, and Colonel Ingcr
soll said ho had better not eat much,
owing to the trouble with his stomach.
He seemed in good spirits then. After
talking for a few minutes. Colonel In
gersoll crossed the room and sat down
in a rocking chair. He .leaned his
head upon his hand, which rested on
the back of the chair. Mrs. Ingersoll
asked him how ho was feeling and he
replied, "Oh. better."
The?,, wo,-,-, his last words. A second ;
after they were uttered he was dead. j
The only sign noticed by Mrs. Inger- j
soli was that the whites of his eyes
suddenly showed. There was not even â¢
a sigh or a groan as death came.. Doc
tors were hastily called, but their ver- i
diet was that death had come instantly. ,
No arrangements have yet been made j
for the funeral, but it will probably
take place on Monday at the hous? and I
the Interment will be in Sleepy Hollow
Cemetery at Tarry town. j
Those present in the house at the
time of his death were his daughters.
Miss Maude Ingersoll and Mrs. W. H.
Brown, Mr. Brown, Mrs. D. W. Parker.
mother of Mrs. [ngersoll, and Mrs. C.
F. Farrell and daughter.
Mrs. Ingersoll was the only person j
In the room with him when he died.
Death came to him as ho had recently 1
expressed a desire it should. He often. j
in old times, said he wished to die slow- ,
ly, with a full consciousness, so he i
might tell those about him how it felt. J
Recently, he experienced a change of j
desire to die painlessly and without !
warning.

BRILLIANT MIND OF
THE GREAT ORATOR
Colonel Ingersoll's orations are regard
ed as gems. Among the most beautiful

brother. Ebon [ngersoll, who died in 1879.
It was his demise that brought forth that
celebrated and exquisite eulogy that has
been considered the greatest burst of ten
der eloquence since Shakespeare's speech
of Marc Antony over the body of Julius
Caesar. The eulogy reads:
"My Friends: I am going to do that
which the dead often promised he would
do for me. The loved and loving brother,
husband. father, friend died where man
hood's morning almost touches noon, and
while the lowa still were falling to
ward the west. He had not passed on
life's highway the stone that marks the
highest point, but being weary for a mo
ment, he lay down by the wayside and
using his burden f or . a pillow fell into
that dreamless sleep that kisses down his
eyelids still. While yet in love with life
and raptured with the world, he passed
to silence and pathetic dust. Yet, after

the breakers of the further shore, a
wreck must mark at last the end of each

every hour Is rich with love and every
moment jeweled with a joy, will, at Its
close, become a tragedy, as sad, and deep,
and dark as can be woven of the warp
and woof of mystery and death. This
brave and tender man in every storm
of life was oak and rock, but in the sun
shine he was vine and flower. He was
the friend of rill heroic souls. IT--, climbed
the heights and left all superstitions far
below, while on his forehead fell the
golden dawning of a grander day. He
loved the beautiful, and was with color,
form- and music touclied to tears. He
sided with the weak, and with a willing
hand gave alms; with loyal heart and
with the purest hand he faithfully dis
charged all public trusts. He was a wor
shiper of liberty and a friend of, the op

him quote the words: 'For justice all

A Rush of Travel Promised for
July, 1901.
T. H. Goodman, general passenger I
agent of the Southern Pacific, received j
a telegram yesterday containing news
which will be of great interest to all
classes of business men in this city. It
came from Assistant General Passen
ger Agent Horsburgh, who is now in ;
Indianapolis, and contained the infor- |
mation, that through the efforts of the
gates from this State*, and Mr.
Horsburgh. the Epworth League Con
vention, which will be held some time j
in July, 1901, had been secured for this
city.. .
This means that at tha*' time San
Francisco will receive in th"" neighbor
hood of 15,000 visitors, many of whom
have never before been within 20 r -'
miles of Pacific tide water.
Mr. " Horsburgh left for Indianapolis,
where the general meeting of the Ep- j
worth League delegates was being .
held, to .decide on where to hold their
convention, for the purpose of assisting
to secure the next one for San Fran-
Cisco. . Yesterday a straw vote was
taken and the returns showed an al
most unanimous predeliotion for the
city by the Golden Gate.
* Professor Springer, who is one of the
committee having the detail matter in
charge, and who is now here with the
National Educationists, said yesterday
that the final vote would be taken
Wednesday next and would of a surety
result in confirming the straw vote of
the meeting in Indianapolis yesterday.
The Southern Pacific offered as an in
ducement, through Mr. Horsburgh. a
round-trip rate. of $50 from all Missouri
River points. This is just one-half the
regular rate and $10 less than one-half
the regular sixty-day stop-over round
trip fare. Through arrangements with
the roads east of the Missouri a like
reduction will be made, which will al
low the tourist to attend the conven
tion from any part of the United States
at one-half or . less than one-half of
what- he -would be forced to pay under
ordinary circumstances.
Four trains containing thirty-four
officers and 978 men of the Nineteenth
Infantry will arrive in the city this
evening; from Fort Meade. The troops
are en route for Manila. Though they
are expected to arrive this evening it
is possible they will not be disembarked
before Monday next.
Yesterday morning the Passenger
Traffic Agents' Association had its reg
ular weekly meeting. Agent Stern of
the Canadian Pacific announced his in
tention of resigning, as he had been in
formed that the association had been
organized in violation of the interstate
commerce law. He has as yet, how
ever, taken no official steps to sever
his connection with the association.
At the Phelan building there is now
being held a conference between the
officials of the Southern Pacific and
delegates representing a large number
of its employes. The conference has for
its object the preparation of a schedule
or wages and working hours which will
be acceptable both to the employers and
the employed.

Mew Member of the Cabinet
Called Upon to Conduct the
Most Important Branch
of the Government
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» '"all.
The President, it i*** said, has deter
mined to have a legal rather than a
military Secretary of War, and to
that end will tender the place in the
Cabinet made vacant by Secretary
Alger's resignation to Mr. Elihu Root
of New York rather than to Colonel
Roosevelt.
The President, without uoubt, is the
best judge of his own necessities. He
has succeeded in demonstrating pret
ty well to the satisfaction of the
country that a soldier Secretary can
not wage war with marked success to
the administration. It will be hoped
that a lawyer Secretary will better
succeed in unraveling the constitu
tional tangle into which the admin
istration is plunged.
NEW YORK. July 21.â Elihu B.
Root of New York, to be Secre
tary of War, vice Russell A. Al
ger, resigned.
Formal announcement of this
appointment will be made to-morrow.
Senator Piatt's hour and a half confer
ence with the President to-night re
sulted in the New York Senator giving
his approval of the decision previously
reached by the President, after a con
sultation with all the members of his
Cabinet, to place Mr. Root at the head
of the War Department. Senator Piatt
was summoned to Washington by the
President for the purpose of ascertain
ing whether Mr. Root's appointment
would be entirely agreeable to him.
But for the desire of the President to
be courteous to the New York Senator
and retain friendly relations with him,
the appointment would have been an
nounced to-day.
Senator Piatt made it known to the
President that General F. V. Greene was
his first choice for the war portfolio,
and he presented some strong reasons
why a soldier rather than a lawyer
should be at the head of that branch
of the Government. It is intimated
that before he became converted to the
President's preference for a lawyer he
secured the promise of another appoint
ment of less importance than a Cabi
net office, but which the Senator par
ticularly desires.
The Senator would not intimate to
night what concessions he had ob
tained, but he said, after leaving the
White House, that he and the President
were thoroughly in accord as to the
result -reached. Piatt declined to say
who had been agreed upon.
"You will have to see the President
if you want to know to-night who the
next Secretary of War will be," said
Piatt. %!M
"It has been understood here that
you were not unfriendly to the appoint
ment of Mr. Root," I observed.
"General Greene was my first choice,"
the Senator stated.
"But it is understood here that the
President had determined to appoint a
lawyer." -'â¢';'
"So I have discovered," laughingly
replied the Senator.
"Would Mr. Root's appointment be
agreeable to you?"
"Any good New York man would be
satisfactory to me. No. I cannot tell
you who has been decided upon, all
that I can say, is that the President
and I are entirely in accord in this
matter."- : â¢ .'-
Tlje selection of Mr. Root is due en
tirely to the President's desire to have
at the head of the War Department a
broad legal mind capable of dealing
with the many important questions
arising out of the administration of the
colonies. From what the President
knows of Mr. Root's reputation as a
lawyer he believes that he is just the
man for the place. He considers that
the War Department will for the next
two or three years be the most import
ant branch of the Government service.
He believes also that there is a great
political future for the man who takes
the office and successfully administers
it. Naturally, the President proposes
to continue as commander-in-chief to
give close attention to the conduct of
the war in the Philippines, but in all
matters of policy Mr. Root's advice
will, of course, be very acceptable to
him. â â 'â 
In the administration of military af
fairs Mr. Root will be assisted by Ma
jor General Miles and Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin. and the President is look
ing for complete harmony of action be
tween these officials.2

LOS ANGELES. July 21.â Not alone has
the Indian Teachers' Institute tint has
been in session during this week In Los
Angeles touched upon every phase of life
of the red man, his future, his schooling
and his training, but teacher, physician,
superintendent and man of God have, had
an opportunity to voice sentiments that
pertain to each branch of the Indian serv
ice. The line of thought that has per
vaded the daily sessions and the papers
discussed is the release of the id lan from
Ids tribal relations, its full scope is out
lined in the following resolution that was
this morning presented by Commissioner
Merrill J. Gab .-,
Resolved, Thai the true object of the
Indian schools and of the Indian man
agement is to accomplish the release
of the Individual Indian from the
slavery of tribal lit.- and to establish
him in the self-supporting freedom of
citizenship and a home in the life of
the nation, and whatever in our pres
ent system hinders the attainment of
this object should be changed.
It remained for Father Ihrysostom Ver
wyst. during his address to superintend- |
ents, to cut into the question and pierce
the core when he declared that the three
great enemies of the Indian were whisky,
money and the white man. Father Y.'r
wyst chose for his topic "The Indian and
the Church." He proclaimed that the ob- j
ject In Indian schools was to civilize
the Indian.
"A white man may have houses and I
money and still be vicious and Immoral."
declared the speaker. "Our forgers.
swindlers, bank-wreckers are civilized j
men; but their civilization is material- j
ism. Money and pleasure are the two ar
ticles of creed of this materialistic civiliz- I
ation. Such was the civilization of Rome
and Greece. It was nothing but refined
barbarism. They legalized infanticide in
Sparta. They deified impurity in Venus,
and drunkenness in Bacchus. They prac
ticed slavery in its most revolting form. |
had their bloody eladltorial shows for the
gratification of the thousands, vet they
were highly civilized.
"God save the Indian from such mate
rialistic civilization. It is a curse, not a
blessing. It docs not elevate man, but .t
drags him down md makes him the slave [ '
of base passions. What civilization do we !
want? Give the Indian a civilization that
will make him better, that will make him J
Tee,-,-,. the great God that made him; |
make' him conscious of his accountability
to his conscience To make- this true civ- {
ilization worthy the name, we want rellg- .
lon. Any system of education that ig
nores religion is a sham. Mere mental !
training is not always a blessing: it is
often a curse to the one that holds this
power and wields it for his own eternal
ruin.
â¢â¢I protest, in the name oi true civiliza
tion and ( -hari!|- toward the Indians,
against the Government's policy,*" which
has set its face against denominational
schools among our Indians and has de
voted them to total extinction in the near
future, in order to give place to a system
of education that will make the Indian
wittier, sharper and more cunning. As
to the older Indians, the way to civilize
them is first by religion. They were civ
ilized by the churchâ and do not forget
by the Catholic church. If, instead of
letting a lot of whitesâ pine land grab
bers and sharpersâ get away with the In
dians' pine for a small sum. out of which
he is cheated by extortionate prices which
are charged at reservation stores in lieu
of his pine if the Government had kept
that pine and other Timber for the benefit
of the Indian and had erected sawmills,
planing mills, tub and stave factories, su
perintended by some Government officials,
the Indian would have made a good living
many years ago."

When talking about the eruption yes
terday Chief Officer Lawless said:
"The afternoon we left Honolulu the
evening papers contained the news that
the lava flow Was within ten* miles of
Hilo arid traveling steadily. The inter
island steamers were crowded with pas
sengers. Pome of the people were going
to view the eruption, and others were'
going to see how their families and
relatives were faring. In my opinion
the. whole orest has been' blown off
Mauna Loa, and if the waters of the sea
have found their way into the crater
then the whole island has been shat- :
tered. In no other way can" I account !
for the peculiar experience we had after
leaving Honolulu. I have been. to sea
a good many years, and never, encoun
tered such a.'peculiar cross sea before.
It would catch the , ship on one side and
then take hold on the other before she
could recover, and in consequence the
passengers had a -merry time of it keep
ing their balance!" â¢ ..'.'
Among the passengers on the Aus
tralia was Major General C. P. Egan
and his wife. The general has a coffee
plantation on the Island of Hawaii, di
rectly in the course of the lava flow
toward Hilo. It is situated about ten
miles up the hills from the town, and
if the flow was not diverted in some
manner then the plantation is covered
by this time. The general is very much
disturbed over the matter, but "is hop
ing against hope that the plantation
has escaped.
There is just a chance that the Aus
tralia on her return trip will go to Hon
olulu via the south end of the Island
of Hawaii. In that event the passen
gers would have a four hours' view of
the volcano in eruption from a distance
of twenty-three miles. seven hours
from a distance .of thirty-five miles,
and nine hours from a distance of fifty
miles. Mauna Loa is 13,650 feet high,
and when the Australia left Honolulu
the pall hanging over the mountain
could be seen from Diamond Head.

"This is a grand yearâ a year filled with
the recollections of the Revolution; filled
with proud and tender memories of the '
past; with the sacred attends of liberty
âa year in which the sons of freedom
will drink from the fountains of enthusi
asm; a year in which the people. call for
a man who has preserved In Congress
what our soldiers won upon the field; a i
year In which they call for the man who j
has torn from the throat of treason the i
tongue of slanderâ for the man who has
snatched the mask of Democracy from
the hideous face of rebellion; for the man
who, like an intellectual athlete, has
Stood in the arena of debate and chal
lenged all comers, and who is still a total
stranger to defeat.
"Like an armed warrior, like a plumed
knight, James G. Blame marched down
the halls of the American Congress and
threw his shining lance full and fair
against the brazen foreheads of the de
tainers of his country and the maligners
of her honor. For the Republican party
to desert this gallant leader now is as
though :an army should desert their gen
eral upon the field of- battle.
"James G. Blame is now and has been
for years the bearer of the sacred stand-
I ard of the Republican party. I call it
sacred," because no human being can
stand, beneath its folds without becoming
and without remaining free.
'-'Gentlemen of the convention, in the
name of the great republic; the only re
public that ever existed upon this earth;
in the name of all her defenders and of
all her - supporters-; in the name of all
ijer soldiers living: in the name of all
her soldiers dead upon the field of cattle,
and In the name of those who perished
in the skeleton clutch of famine at An
dersonville and Llbby, whose sufferings

nominates that prince of parliamenta

Blame."
Colonel Ingersoll's retorts were as quick
as a flashlight and as searching. One of
them was so startling and so effective
as to give a certain famous, long-drawn
out railroad suit the nickname of tha
"Ananias and- Sapphira. case." Ingersoll
was speaking and had made certain state
ments highly damaging to the other side
in such a way as to thoroughly anger a
member of the opposing counsel, who sud
denly interrupted the speaker with the
abrupt and sarcastic remark:
"I suppose the colonel, in the nature of
things, never heard of the story of Ana
nias and Sapphira."
There were those present who expected
to witless an angry outburst on the part
of Ingersoll In response to this plain im
plication that his statement had not the
quality of veracity, but they were disap
pointed. Ingersoll didn't even get angry.
He turned slightly, fixed his limpid blue
eyes upon the interrupter and smiled
cherubically. Then he gently drawled out:
"Oh, yes, I have; yes, I have. And I've
watched the gentleman who has just
spoken all through this case with a curi
ous interest. I've been expecting every
once and awhile to see him drop dead,
but he seems to be all right down to the
present moment." ['".'â 
Ingersoll never became angry when in
terrupted, even If In the middle of an ad
dress or a lecture. A man Interrupted
him In Cincinnati once, cutting right Into
the lecturer's most resonant periods with
a yell:
"That's a lie, Bob Ingersoll, and you
know it."
The audience was In an uproar in an In
stant, and cries of "Put himout:" "Throw
him downstairs!" and the like were heard
from all parts of the house. Ingersoll
stopped talking for a moment and held
up his hands, smiling.
"Don't hurt the man," he said. "He
thinks he is right. But let me explain
this thing for his especial benefit."
Then he reasoned the matter out ln lan
guage so simple and plain that no one of

any Intelligence whatever could fall to
comprehend. Th"c man was not ejected,
but sat through the entire address and
at the close asked the privilege c * beg
ging the lecturer's pardon.
Like most men of genius, Colonel Inger
soll was a passionate lover of music, and
the harmonies of "Wagner seemed to him
to be the very acme of musical expres
sion. In giving voice to his love â¢ for
Wagnerian strains he once said:
"There is something more in music' than
j can be expressed in rhythmical periods,
I some greater joy than can be felt by
j hearing it simply accented in measured
intervals. It struck me long ago that that
I music which rose and fell at precisely the
: same distances with exactly the same
: emphasis did not express the feelings of
i the heart; that there must be some splen
' did composition that did not have to come
back to the starting place in so many
beats. There is a music of the heart and
of the Intellect and of thought, and this
I hold to be the music of Wagner. Of
i all the composers of the world, in my
judgment, Wagner stands at the head.
; Shakespeare uses the same words as we
! do, and yet they glitter with a light that
iit Is impossible for us to give. When we
read him we wonder, 'Is It possible that
: this man does this in a common way?'
And when I hear the ri-Tusic of Wagner I
say, 'Is it possible that this is made with
i ordinary chords?' The moment the or
t chestra begins to play Wagner's strains
' all the instruments are transfigured. They
i seem to utter sounds that they have been
longing to utter ever since they were
| made. Even the dm nis join in the joy
! ous riot. The old bass* viol is alive with
; passion. The 'cellos throb with love and
; the violins thrill with the divine feeling.
; When I hear this music It seems to me
that it is full of glory of color through
which the' violins picture the coming of
.the morning, and the horns the glory of
the stars gleaming above us. Color comes
i gradually from the other instruments and
then the orchestra floods the world with
the day."
Notwithstanding his thoroughly her
etical beliefs, or lack of beliefs, or. as he
would say, because of them. Colonel In
. gersoll was a very tender hearted man.
No one has ever made so strong an ar
gument against vivisection in the alleged
! interests of science as Ingersoll did In a
speech a few years ago. To the presenta-
I tion of his views against the refinements
, of scientific cruelty he brought his most
I vivid imagination, his most careful
thought and his most Impassioned ora
tory. So. too, he was indignant concern
ing what he called the crimes against
criminals, who are often, he believed,
more sinned against than sinning.
; "What shall be done," he asked, "with
the slayers of their fellow-men, with mur
, derers? Shall the nation take life? The
'. tendency of the extreme penalty is to pre
vent conviction. In the presence of death
*it is easy for a jury to find a doubt. If
the penalty were imprisonment for life
. the jury would feel that if a mistake were
made it could be rectified. But where the
penalty is death a mistake is fatal, A con
! scientious man takes into consideration
the defects of human nature, the uncer
tainty of testimony and the countless
' shadows that dim and darken the under;
j standing, and refuses to find a verdict
! that, if wrong,- cannot be righted. â¢ The
death penalty inflicted by the Govern
ment is a perpetual excuse for mobs. The
greatest danger in a republic is a mob,
; and- as long as States inflict the penalty
; of death mobs will follow the example."

TOBIN THOUGHT HE
SAW THE BANSHEE
The upper office men of the Police De
partment have for the past three days
been engaged In a ghost hunt. Instead
of following their* usual occupation of
trailing pickpockets, petty larcenlsts and
other criminals, the detectives have been
devoting their time to investigating a
home-made spook who terrorized the
neighborhood of Sutter and Octavia
streets and incidentally certain members
of the- Police Department.'
It is needless to state that the spook
is now out of a job. but before It went
out of business it came near driving De
tectives Anthony and Ellis and Sergeant
Tobln out of their minds.
It was a real genteel spook, and made
Its nightly visitations at a certain resi
dence on Sutter street quite close to the
corner of Octavia. The lady of the house
grew alarmed and reported the matter to
Chief Lees. Anthony, Ellis and Tobln
were detailed to do a star turn with the
"supernatural being." They visited the
house and all three imagined that they
really saw a ghost, and each crossed hi's
heart in asseverating that he had not
been In Chinatown that evening. Tobln
was convinced that he had at last run
afoul of the banshee. It was ascertained
yesterday that the spook was nothing
more than a neglected wheel on one of
the Sutter street cars which passed the
house at 10 o'clock each evening.. The of
ficers have each made a solemn vow to
smoke nothing In the future stronger
than Napa soda. Anthony hunted up a
Rabbi yesterday" and took the pledge.
DEWEY TALKS
AT A BANQUET
AT TRIESTE
Modestly Gives Others Credit
for the Victory in
Manila Bay.
SPEAKS AUSTRIA
â Â» â
After Cabling Upon Emperor Fran
cis Joseph the Admiral Will
Seek Rest in the Tyrol.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS! 1 ", by James Gor
don Bennett.
TRIESTE, July Admiral Dewey
will give a dinner to-morrow night on
the -cruiser Olympia, In honor of Min
ister Harris, with whom he may so the
next day to Vienna. Subsequently, the
admiral may go to Tschl to call on the
Emperor of Austria and then to th_
Tyrol for rest.
At a banquet to the admiral, given
this evening, after a toast to President
McKinley had been drunk, Mr. Harris,
the American Minister, as host, pro
posed the health of Admiral Dewey,
who in reply, said simply: "I thank
you sincerely, and drink to your good
health.','
Captain Fass responded to the toast.
"The American Navy." Mr. Harris
then proposed "The Captain and Crew
of the Olympia," and requested Ad
miral Dewey to relate something of the
battle of Manila. The Admiral replied:
"I only know that having asked the
steward for something to drink, he
gave me lukewarm, weak coffee, which
made me feel quite sick, but my flag
lieuteirant kept the record and I invite
him to speak."
Flag Lieutenant Brumby said; "I
was a midshipman under. Admiral
Dewey and he taught me not to talk,
so I will only say 'Dewey did it.' "
Admiral Dewey rose again and said:
"You ask me about the guns and the
superiority of our firing. We fired ten
shots a minute with our 5-inch guns
against three shots a minute. I found
at Manila no more neutral flag than
the Austrian." , ,
At this point Mr. Harris interposed,
saying: "Austria is sincerely friendly
to the I'nited States."
Admiral Dewey, then, addressing
himself to the Olynipia's chief en
gineer, said that he had contributed to
j the success of the ship in entering the
Bay of Manila by admirable steaming,
'bringing the speed up to eighteen knots
I immediately when ordered to put on
j full .si-am.
In concluding the banquet Mr. Harris
! proposed a toast to Emperor Francis
Joseph.
A large crowd gathered outside the
! hotel to watch the arrival of the guests.
WASHINGTON. July 21.â A cablet
i gram received by Secretary Long to-day
from Admiral Dewey means that, in
the presence of the President, Secretary
i Long will present to the hero* of Manila
: Bay on the steps at iheÂ«east front of the
! Capitol the sword which Congress voted
| to him in recognition of his conduct of
the battle of Manila Bay.
Secretary Long stated to-day that he
! had no reason to believe that Admiral
! Dewey would arrive in New York Har-
I bor before October 1, the date originally
I set by that officer. The committee
; here is doing everything it can to na-
I tionalize and internationalize the Ad
! miral's return, and has addressed in
vitations to foreign governments to
send warships to New York to take
part in th" ceremonies incidental to
| the Admiral's arrival. Some of the
I members of the Diplomatic Corps have
unofficially represented to the naval of
ficials that their governments cannot
accept invitations from municipalities,
and the Department of State may con
sequently be called upon to formally is
'â â  sue invitations, especially as some of
1 the governments have indicated their
| desire to be represented at New York
by a man-of-war when the Olympia is
I at that port:
Admiral Dewey will be escorted from
New York to Washington by a special
sub-committee. He will travel in a
special train elaborately decorated, and
upon arrival there will be escorted to
his hotel. tftf- tf _^
After paying his respects to the Pres
ident and Secretary Long the admiral
will be escorted to the east front of the
Capitol/where the presentation will oc
cur. The evening of that day will be
1 marked by a grand military, naval and
civic parade, which will be reviewed
by the President, Secretary Long and
I Admiral Dewey. The city will be il
i luminated and a pyrotechnic display
I will add to the occasion.
Secretary Long told me to-day that
i he had reached no* decision as to the
duty to which the admiral will be as
signed upon his return.
"I will consult with him about the
matter upon his return," he said.
There is little doubt, however, that
the admiral will be stationed in Wash
ington and will be placed at the head
of an Important board, probably ad
visory in character. Should a reor
ganization of the department occur and
a board of admirals conduct the me
chanical business of the department
Admiral Dewey will remain in Wash
ington. _, _, _
NEW YORK, July 21.â A v London
cable to the World from Trieste says:
| Privately Admiral Dewey expressed a
determination not to be a candidate for
President and hoped McKinley would
be re-elected.

SAD DEATH OF
A LIFE-SAVER
â¢
Jack Hogan Drowned in
Heroic Struggle.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FIRE ISLAND LIGHT, N. V.. July 21.â
Adelbert G. Hubert of California, while
bathing, although a strong swimmer, was
unable to breast the strong current, and
was gradually carried out to sea. He cried
for help, and Jack Hogan of the life-sav
ing crew responded with others, including
Edmond Lazard, a French cook. The
waves almost ingulfed them. When Laz
ard reached the shore Hogan was just
going Into the surf. Howard Baylisa
threw off his outer garments and followed.
Hogan and Baylisa finally reached Hu
bert's side, almost exhausted. In an en
deavor to gain a hold on the drowning
man they forced him under water. He
gasped: "Don't push me under; I guess
I am all right."
Bayliss and Hogan released their hold,
and were quickly swept away. Bayliss
got near enough to shore for the men who
were waist-deep in the surf to seize him
and drag him to the beach, where he lav
unconscious. Hubert drifted nearer the
shore. Several times -the waves buried
him from the sight of the throng on the
beach.
Hogan, who was still striving to reach
the shore, was seen to throw up his hands
and sink. His body rose and fell In the
surf, but always just beyond reach. Hu
bert, who had drifted close into shore
several hundred yards up the beach, re
gained his footing. With assistance he
struggled ashore and ran up the beach
to aid his would-be rescuer.
Hogan was rolling face downward in the
surf. No lifeline was at hand, but the
men, who were waist deep in the water,
dragged the rope after them. One of them
reached Hogan, who was drawn ashore,
limp and unconscious. Two hours' work
failed to resuscitate him.
Hogan, who is about 30 years old and
unmarried, had a long record of lives
saved. _ _,
Smith Oakley, who has charge of I- ire
Island, which is State property, said to
night: "I have seen many drowning ac
cidents and rescues, but I never witnessed
a more remarkable instance of presence
of mind than that displayed by Hubert,
and to it he undoubtedly owes his life.
Hubert said: "An immense wave swept
me oft mv feet and carried me beyond my
depth. While a good swimmer, my
strength was exhausted by this time.
Again and again the waves swept over
me, and I swallowed much water. I then
called for 'Jack,' and soon saw Hogan
and another man coming toward me.
When they reached me they placed their
hands heavily on mv shoulders, thereby
forcing me under. Hogan was purple in
the "face and puffing violently. I saw
they could not help me. and I said: 'Let
me go; 1 am all right if you stay by me.
At this tiny both released their hold and
were swept away.
â¢'1 tried to swim on my back, but be
coming exhausted called to them to come
Ink I turned my head, and when I saw
the two men. one of them a life saver
and a powerful swimmer, in a life and
death struggle to reach shore I gave .up
all hope. I turned to take one last look
at the shore, and my thoughts turned at
once to the grief of my parents in Cali-
fornla. ' â¢'. _ _ _,
"Suddenly I heard voices and shouting,
and raising my head carefully saw I was
near shore. A big wave struck me just
then nnd hurled me into the arms of those
waist-deep in the surf. I was dragged
ashore, and was horror-struck to learn
that Hogan's body was rolling in the surf
farther up the beach."
FAI_~ TO STOP CONR.O*-.
Armstrong Gets the Decision, but Is
Badly Punished.
NEW YORK, July 21.â 80b Armstrong.
the colored heavy-weight, of Chicago,
who has championship aspirations, failed
to -stop "Stockings" Conroy of Troy in
the twenty-round fight at the Broadway
Athletic Club, although he got the deci
sion after a battle that was a mixture of
commonplace and sensational features.
As far as punishment went, the victor
trot the worst of the encounter, for he was
badly cut up about the face and narrowly
escaped being knocked out a half dozen
times He landed the most blows, how
ever, "and had the best of it on points by
a good margin.
Conroy came to the ring with twenty
pounds of superfluous flesh. Armstrong,
one the contrary* was in superb shape and
towered above his stocky opponent.
In the opening rounds Armstrong was
wild and Conroy kept up against him
without doing any damage. The pace
quickened and became a fight In the tenth
round Then there were three rounds of
hurricane fighting, and out of each of
them the colored man reeled to his corner
bleeding and groggy. The 10 to 8 money
that had gone on him ln large quantities
looked in danger. He pulled out, how
ever, and had the better of the last five
rounds. _

Building of New Cruisers.
WASHINGTON. July 21.â Board of
Naval Chiefs decided to-day to give thirty
months for building the six new protected

CRUISER BONAVENTURE.
PINGREE DEFENDS
POLITICAL PARTNER
Accuses McKinley of
Cowardice.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT. Mich, July 21â Governor
r:ngree to-day handed to the Associ
ated Press a prepared, signed inter
view, giving what the Governor asserts
to be "facts which are absolute!" reli
able," bearing upon the relations be
tween Secretary Alger and President
McKinley, with which the public is
not familiar.
At the outset the Governor says: "I
have no hesitation in saying that the
course pursued by the President in this
matter is little less than cowardly. It
is, to say the least, very unmanly."
Governor Pingree said his informa- !
tion did not come from General Alger, !
but from "one whose knowledge of the |
facts cannot be disputed."
Proceeding, he says that repeatedly
since the Eastern newspapers began
their attack upon Secretary Alger the
Secretary informed the President th;A
'if these press comments embarrassed
the administration in the slightest de
gree he would resign at once, but the
President as often protested emphati
cally that he ha_ the utmost confidence
in Secretary Alger and his conduct of
the War Department, and that the
country could not afford to lose his ser
vices. The Governor says that at the
time his "alleged alliance" with Gen
eral Alger was announced and before
his disavowal of interviews criticizing
the President had reached Washington,
General Alger told the President that
upon the President's slightest intima
tion he would resign, but the President
refused to entertain the idea for a mo
ment.
As to the alleged "alliance" being any
reason for asking for General Alger's
resignation, Governor Pingree says:
"Long before my announcement that
I I would su-nort General Alger for the
: Senate, Secretary of State Hay, on I
i Ju- 2 last, requested Vice President j
Hobart to intimate to General Alger ;
â¢ that his resignation would be accept- j
'â  able to the President and would relieve \
him from the embarrassing attacks of
.the press upon the conduct of the war.
Mr. Hobart properly declined to be a,
party to such an unmanly, not to say i
j cowardly, proceeding, and expressed
| his opinion in terms decidedly vigorous. i
"After that General Alger, entirely
ignorant of this miserable conspiracy, j
i several times offered to end the attacks
I by submitting his resignation, but still
1 the President did not have the courage
to express himself to his Secretary.
General Alger finally, did hand in his
I resignation, to take effect January 2.
j The President dared not face the gen
â  eral in a manly way and ask him to re
| tire and give his reasons for making the
; request. He finally accomplished by in
; direction what, he dared not do in an
open and frank manner himself."
Governor Pingree states that Mr. Ho
; bart was finally prevailed upon by At
â¢ ' torney General Griggs to convey to the
Secretary that his resignation was de
j sired, "and gave my 'alleged alliance'
with the Secretary as a pretext."
Commenting upon the whole matter,
the Governor says that General Alger's
sacrifice was compelled by demands of
New York politicians backed by the j
"unscrupulous and heartless press." He I
predicts that it will be learned "that I
the President himself has been respon- j
sible for whatever mistakes have been j
i made in conducting the war."
He adds: "I am told on the very best j
I authority that General Alger made very
! few appointments of officers during the
j war, and that the commissions were
' issued almost entirely upon the orders
i of the President."
The Governor alleges that the more
; recent attacks upon Alger in the East
I were caused by his frank declaration ft
'opposition to trusts, and he added there
i is a decided odor of trusts around the
: present administration, with Mark
Ilanna as the acknowledged, "king
j maker."
In conclusion the Governor calls upon
Michigan people and newspapers to
protest against the injustice done the
I State's foremost representative in pub
lic life. -It is conjectured here that
Brigadier General Henry M. Duffleld
gave some of the foregoing information,
but the general declines to be inter
j viewed.
Found Dead in a Tree.
STOCKTON, July -An inquest was

MODUS VIVENDI
NOW HOPED FOR
Prospect of Settlement
of Alaskan Boundary.
â * â
NEGOTIATIONS ARE RESUMED
â â
GREAT BRITAIN MAKES SLIGHT
CONCESSION.
â  â¢
Has Not Given Up the Claim to a
Port on Lynn Canal, but Aban
dons the Idea of Securing
Pyramid Harbor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. July 21.â
As a result of the resumption of nego
tiations respecting the Alaskan boundary;
controversy administration officials seem
to be growing confident that the modus
Vivendi will be at last agreed upon.
Naturally the authorities dislike to give
I express! to any optimism because the
! two governments are not by any means
yet out of the woods, but the fact that
the British Government replied to the
American note, and it was stated author
itatively to-day, had made a concession,
slight, perhaps, but nevertheless a con
cession, is considered by well informed
officials to mean that an agreement may
yet be reached. 'Â».
Great Britain, acting for Canada, has
not yet given up the hope of securing a
port on Lynn Canal, thou- she has aban
doned her proposition that her right to
Pyramid Harbor be inserted in the modus
Vivendi.
I understand that the two governments
are agreed that the modus Vivendi shall
not be construed as in any way prejudic
ing their claims to the territory in con
troversy, but in urging her claim to Pyra
mid Harbor Great Britain was actuated,
it is believed, by a desire to show before
an arbitral tribunal that might be ap
! pointed to determine the exact location,
of the boundary line that the United
States has so little faith in its own pre
tensions that it permitted her to occupy
Pyramid Harbor. __. _
The determined objection of this *- ,0%
--ernment caused the abandonment of the
British proposition, and while there is
1 still considerable difference In the claims
' of the two governments yet it is hoped in
view of Secretary Hay's courteous repo
sent yesterday that the British Govern
ment will be willing to advance still
further In order to meet the suggestions
of this Government. it can be re.iterateu
positively that the United States does not
propose to permit Great Britain to nave
jurisdiction over the territory occupied
by American mines, ami for this reason as
well as its desire to strictly observe the
treaties defining the boundary the lihe
' must be fixed above the village of KlueK
wan, as already fixed by Secretary Hay.
' Because of the muddled condition of the
controversy Secretary Hay has been com
pelled to postpone his vacation, but the
resumption of active negotiations and
their delicate conduct by the Secretary
1 have strengthened the hope of the Presi
dent and members of the High Joint Com
mission that it will not be long before the
modus Vivendi will be signed. The mat
ter is being actively pressed, and until it
is settled the department will be unable
; to announce whether the High Joint Com
' mission will be adjourned to a definite
date or indefinitely.
Senator Fairbanks was in conference
with Secretary Hay and Special Reciproc
ity Commissioner Kasson to-day regard
ing the Alaskan boundary question and
later called- upon the President with
whom he discussed the dispute. He will
probably make an official statement to
morrow regarding the matter.

Would Put Anti-Trust and

â¦
Tammany Works Hard Against the
Nebraska,,- but Will Not Bolt
if He Is Renominated.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, July 21.â William J. Bry
an to-day explained to his lieutenants
that anti-trusts and anti-imperialism
Issues must be pushed to the front.
"While Mr. Bryan declines to formally
eet forth liis views beyond what he
says In his speeches, it is believed he
counts on benefiting by reaction from
.the indecisive attitude of the McKinley
administration. In his view the Philip
pine question was one in which the
public looked to their leaders for guid
ance. It was not a case of waiting to
find out what the people wanted be-
use they- -were in doubt.
So, Mr. Bryan took an early stand
against territorial expansion, or, as he
calls it, imperialism. If Mr. McKinley
had taken other ground directly and
openly, Mr. Bryan seems to think the
administration would have been
stronger.
Some of Mr. Bryan's lieutenants are
expansionists. They have remonstrat
ed privately with him. but he told them
to-day he would not change his posi
tion. He reminded them that he had
advocated the prompt ratification of
the treaty of Paris and that he had not
declared in favor of withdrawing
troops from the Philippines.
I* & seeks to force a:, official declara
tion from the McKinley administration
that it is th- purpose to hold the archi
pelago as a territory and thus raise
the discussion of the permanent reten
tion of the Philippines. Meanwhile he
evidently expects reaction from the
lack of vigorous military measures and
from the effect produced by returning
volunteers.
Mr. Bryan made it apparent that he
thinks expansion or Imperialism may
become an overshadowing issue. How
ever, he gives he New York Democrats
no encouragement to persist in their
pleas to have free silver taken out
of the platform.
â¢'They overestimated my influence,"
he remarked, "because 1 believe in free
silver and am going in the same direc
tion as others who believe in it. If
they think others would cease to go for
ward If I turned back, they are wrong."
NEW YORK, July 21â Tammany
realized to-day that all its work to stop
the Bryan boom had come to naught.
li.- was a wag who said that Tam
many's effort to beat Colonel Bryan for
-I-,.. Presidency would be resumed the
flrst week in August. The wag meant ,
that Richard Crocker would 1.- back
the first week In August, and until that
time Colonel Bryan would be permitted
to occapv the position in which the
events of Thursday at Chicago have
placed himâ of . being the sole pretender j
to the Democratic throne. Mr. Croker |
is coming back at least a week earlier
than he had intend
Developments at Chicago, at the
meeting of the Democratic National
Committee rather dazed the/local Tam
many leaders, who have beeen assist
ing Mr. Croker in his campaign to con
trol the next National Convention. John
F. Carroll, the deputy leader of Tam
many, was out of the city, but Corpor
ation Counsel Whalen, Sheriff Dunn.
Mayor Van Wyck and Tax Commis-
Bipner Feitner were in their offices. Not
a man would say a word for publica
tion, but It was evident that they were
prepared for the inevitable and willing
to accept the view that Bryan was
able and willing to nominate himself.
The state of mind in which the Tam
many politicians found themselves per
mit this statement to be made as to
the organization's policy: Bryan's re
nomination is regarded as possible, but
Tammany will do everything in its
power to prevent it.
Falling in that, Tammany will en
deavor to keep 18 to I out of the plat
form and got 'he platform and Bryan's
views toned down to suit the Eastern j
Democrats.

with the spanking brushes, making it
necessary to put In new ones. We have
found it impossible to keep the crowds
away from the carriage, and while
watching one part curious and ma
licious people toy with whatever is in
sight. We stopped at Canostota for
two hours, repairing the spokes and for
luncheon, making the run into Syra
cuse in three minutes less than two
hours, making the total running time
from Utica to Syracuse, fifty-four
miles, four hours and fifteen minutes.
The roads were on the whole excel
lent, except short stretches, and the
turnpike into Syracuse was nearly ideal.
At the city line we struck the meanest
"thank you inarms" and mudholes thus
far seen. The outlying streets are a
disgrace to the municipality. A big
crowd awaited us and escorted us in,
Mr. H. F. Brower being present with
his Duryea motor.
We made a fine run in, but at the
corner of Fayette and State streets met
with a serious accident. The bolt con
necting the piston between the two cyl
inders snapped and the forward piston
tore a big hole in the casing of the
Kinder and bent the main shaft. 1
stopped the motor and also went to a
machine shop to effect repairs. These
will be completed to-morrow, and we
will take up our journey.
Truly it is "Frisco or bust," but so
far it has been mostly "bust." We are
, by the thieves. An entrance was obtained
by prying open a cellar door. Once in the
cellar the burglars entered the main
building by means of a stairway. They
took away silverware to -the value of $200
' and, returning to the cellar, carried away
'â  bottles of wine aggregating $100 in cost.
! A peculiar feature of the burglary was
j that after the men re-entered the cellar
i they closed the door leading to the main
| floor and had a merry carousal. Bottles
! of wine were smashed, groceries thrown
! topsy-turvey and milk spilled over the
; floor. One thief stepped in a crate of
I butter and left the imprint of his foot.
USED ANOTHER'S NAME
TO GAIN A LIVING
Blacklisted Railroad Man Killed by a
Train in the Yards at
Saugus.
DOS ANGELES. July 21.â A railroad
man who called himself Robert J. Dun
lop of Denver, Col., was instantly killed
by a train at Saugus yesterday. Dun
lop came to Los Angeles from Denver
over a month ago, having been former
ly connected with the Denver and Rio
Grande. He was looking for employ
ment and had received a letter, which
was found upon his person, from the
yardmaster at The Needles, offering
him work.
Yesterday Dunlop walked from New
hall to Saugus. There was a freight
train standing there, and he went to
the caboose to have a talk with the
train crew. He was standing on the
steps of the caboose when the train
suddenly moved. Dunlop lost his bal
ance and fell to the ground. The wheels
of the caboose passed over his neck and
nearly decapitated him.
At noon to-day a railroad man named
Michael Connor, who resides in this
city, called at the police station and
told a peculiar story regarding the
death of Dunlop. Connor says that the
man was In reality Charles Ryan, for
merly employed on the Rock Island
Route. He was one of the strikers who
stayed out In the great strike of 1894
and was blacklisted. He went all over
the country trying to get work, but
failed. When his friend. Robert J. Dun
lop, also a railroad man, enlisted for
the war, Ryan assumed his name and
took his card as a member of the union,
In order to get work.
The real Robert J. Dunlop is now in
the Philippines, a member of Company
D. Fourteenth Regiment United States
volunteers, under Captain Hart. Ever
since he went away from Denver in a
soldier's uniform Ryan has used his
name and credentials. A curious state
of affairs now exists. Robert J. Dun
lop is declared by a Coroner's jury to
be legally dead and is in fact alive, or
was when last heard from.
BRADY OF ALASKA
OPPOSED TO TRUS T S
Writes to Sayers of Texas, Reg-retting
That He Cannot Attend the
Conference.
AUSTIN, Tex., . July 21.â Governor
Savers to-day received a< letter from Gov
\ ernor John <;. Brady of Alaska on the.
subject of the proposed anti-trust confer
ence to be held In St. Louis. Brady says:
"I shall not be able to accept your In-
vitation, because I have mapped out a
trip down the Yukon River to St. Michael,
from there to the seal Islands and around
the coast back to Sitka. The subject of
trusts is one of the most important of our
time, and just how to grapple with it and
control it Is a serious problem. Some of
our States are no doubt lax In making" it
easy for any and all kinds of corporations
to be created. It would seem therefore
proper that remedies be applied. Here In
Alaska we have not suffered very much,
save only as to prices of such staple
commodities as have been raised by
trusts. We feel here that capital must
be encouraged by allowing it to combine
under suitable laws, for it requires such
to undertake the development of our re
sources here In Alaska. I am certainly in
f-tvor of regulating these vast combina
tions which undertake to shin off all com
petition and limit production according to
what they think It should be. I hate to
see all small dealers driven to the wall,
and do not believe that it is good public
policy to allow it. Perhaps no better time
in our history could occur for this great
problem to arise and have the people care
fully deliberate upon It and settle It. I
wish you all success In your efforts."
British Sailor Drowned.
HONOLULU, July 14.â George Gibson, a

CORCORAN'S ALIBI THE
POINT OF ATTACK
Prosecution in the Wardner Case
Seeks to Disprove Defend
ant's Statements.
WALLACE, Idaho. July 21.â Most of the
day was taken up by argument on the ad
missibility of evidence regarding Corco
ran's residence before the Coroner's jury.
The Judge took the matter under advise
ment until to-morrow morning, statin.
that he doubted if it was admissible. The
State will make every possible effort to
secure Its admission, as it contradicts
every witness who has aided In providing
an alibi. Corcoran testified before the
Coroner's jury that be went home at 11
o'clock, remaining until 4, during which
time he saw and conversed with but two
persons. This is in conflict with the testi
mony of more than a dozen "witnesses,
who testified to having seen and con
versed with him in Burke between these
hours.
Juror Carr was ill all day and to-night
is under the care of a physician. His
sickness may delay the trial somewhat.

IS EXPLODED
UNDER A CAR
Strike at Cleveland Assumes
a More Serious
Aspect.

â â
Fierce Rioting in the Streets F c
lowed by the Summoning of
the Naval Militia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, 0., July 21.â The street
railway strike is assuming a more
threatening aspect. At 4 o'clock this
afternoon Mayor Farley ordered the
naval reserves to prepare for strike
duty. This organization, 104 strong,
armed with Lee rifles and Gatling and
Gardiner machine guns, assembled at
the armory on Sibley street at 6 o'clock
and to-night slept there. They are
awaiting the further orders of the
Mayor.
To-night there was rioting on Wilson
avenue and on Pearl street. A mob of
5000 congregated on Wilson avenue, be
tween Payne avenue and Superior
street, and threw stones at every car
that came along. A squad of twenty
policemen tried to keep order and only
partly succeeded, the disorder continu
ing until the cars stopped running at 11
p. m. They were compelled to charge
the mob, repeatedly using their heavy
riot clubs, and many broken heads are
the result. One arrest was made.
An attempt was made to blow up a
street car with dynamite at 9:30 o'clock
this evening. The car was on Euclid
avenue, returning to the Lakeview
barns, when a terrific explosion oc
curred under the wheels at Annandale
avenue, opposite the residence of Henry.
A. Everett, president of the Big Con
solidated Street Railway Company.
The car was nearly jolted off the track,
but was not stopped. The half dozen
passengers on board were badly fright
ened, but none of them were injured.
No harm was sustained by the car and
it proceeded on its journey. There is
no clue to the perpetrators.
About the same time on Pearl street
the non-union street railway men who
had left the Holmden avenue barns to
purchase tobacco were pursued by. a
howling mob. One of the fugitives fired
a revolver, but hit no one, and the bul
let passed through a large plateglass
window across the street. The street
car men sought refuge in a store, and
lat this time the police arrived and
i charged into the crowd, scattering it
j quickly . In the confusion a number of
' women who were in the crowd were
thrown down and a little girl was
struck by a policeman's club and se
verely bruised.
STATUS OF THE STRIKE
IN GREATER NEW YORK
NEW YORK, July 21.â 1n the bor
oughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn to
day the strike situation, generally
speaking, remains unchanged. On
Manhattan Island cars on all the lines
of the Metropolitan system were run
on practically the usual headway, and
at night the cars on Second avenue.
Sixth and Eighth avenues were under
police protection, although the claim
is made by the company that there is
no longer any necessity even for this.
Policemen still guard the depots of the
several lines. It is expected they will
be sent back to the stations Saturday
or Sunday, and if this is done little
trouble will be anticipated with the
strikers in the future.
The events of the greatest Interest
during the day were the arrest of Pres
ident Rossiter of the Brooklyn Rapid
Transit Company on a warrant issued
by Magistrate Brenner, charging him
with criminal libel, Albert L. Johnson,
formerly president of the Nassau Hail
road, being the complainant, and the
notification of the different attorneys
within the limits of Greater New _ork
that the ten-hour law was enforcible
and asking them to communicate with
Secretary John P. Donnelly of the
building trades section of the Centra!
Trade Union and submit complaints to
a Grand Jury or Magistrate. The ar
rest of President Rossiter, although in
teresting, will not, it is thought, have
any marked effect on the strike.
Ex-President Johnson objects to
statements made by President Rossiter
to Brooklyn reporters in a recent inter
view. In the interview Mr. Rossiter is
quoted as saying, after referring to the
strikers charged with blowing up the
Fifth avenue elevated structure with
dynamite: "Those are not my men.
Mr. Albert L. Johnson is welcome to
them; Mr. Albert L. Johnson is the
leader of them; lam told that there is
evidence against some of the men to
send them to prison for twenty years."
The letters written by Mayor Van
Wyck to each of the district attorneys
of the four counties Included within the
city, regarding the enforcement of the
ten-hour law. It is thought may result
in a transference of the street car
trouble of Greater New York to the
courts.
After requesting the different district
attorneys to bring the subject of the
alleged enforcement of the ten-hour
law to the Grand Jury or Magistrates
having jurisdiction, the Mayor wrote
to Secretary Donnelly informing him
that violations of the labor laws should
by brought to the attention of the Dis
trict Attorneys in the county where the
offense Is committed and notifying him
of the instructions sent to those offi
cials. The strikers held various meet
ings to-night in the different boroughs.
The Brooklyn strike leaders still seem
to be of the opinion that the men have
a chance for victory. During the after
noon and evening strikers on both sides
of 'the East River discussed the wisdom
of the policy of the programme of Mas
ter Workman Parsons to march to the
City Hall with thousands of men for
the purpose of protesting to Mayor
Van Wyck against the alleged violation
of the ten-hour law. On account of the
action of Mayor Van Wyck in address
ing letters to various district attor
neys asking them to arrange for en
forcement of this law it was decided
to give up the march to the City Hall.

ROBBERS KIDNAP
AN ABLE-BODIED
MAN IN DAYTIME
Crowded Street in Tacoma the
Scene of Their Daring
Exploit.
TACOMA, July David Brittain. a railroad brakeman employed by
the Northern Pacific, created a sensation at police headquarters this after
noon by telling a story of kidnaping and robbery seldom equaled in the an
nals of Tacoma.
According to his story he drew his pay check yesterday shortly after
noon and got it cashed by a Pacific-avenue saloon-keeper. A number of
men were about the saloon, when he received the coin, but he paid no-atten
tion to thera and proceeded up Pacific avenue.
When Brittain reached the corner of Eleventh and Railroad streets he
was accosted by a heavy-set man, who stepped out of a buggy that was
standing near the sidewalk, the stranger asking him if he knew the address
of a certain real estate firm. Brittain replied in the negative. The man sud
denly seized his arm and pushed him into the buggy, in which another man
was seated, and the rig drove off.
Brittain said he tried to remonstrate, but was silenced by the sight at a
knife which the big man drew, telling him to keep his mouth shut or he
would be cut into ribbons.
The buggy was then driven down Railroad street to Fifteenth and out
that thoroughfare until it passed the city limits and reached Lakeview. The
kidnapers seemed to want to avoid observation, for. they took unfrequented
roads and drove as fast as their jaded horse would travel. When near
Hillhurst, Brittain says, they produced a bottle of whisky, from which they
drank, and which was offered to him. He refused, and they then pulled
him out of the buggy and took his money, amounting to $71 50, and his
watch. It was then about 6 o'clock.
The men drove off, leaving him in the road. Not being familiar with the
locality he wandered about until dark and then sat down under a tree
where he remained all night, starting to walk back to Tacoma at daylight
this morning. He went first to the railroad offices and reported his adven
ture and then called tit the police headquarters. He described his kidnapers
closely, stating that the one who pushed him into the buggy was a heavy-set
man about 45 years of age. His companion was somewhat younger He had
never seen either . f them before. The buggy Brittain described as an old
affair, dusty as though it had recently undergone a long journey
The Police Department Is mystified at Brittain's tale, failing to see how
so bold a kidnaping could take place in open daylight without attention
being attracted to it, but is losing no time in tracing the matter up The
cashing of the pay check and several other details have been verified' The
corner where Brittain claimed to have been kidnaped is in the center of
the city and in front of both daily newspaper offices.
STORIES OF ATTEMPTS
TO KILL DREYFUS
Sham Rescue at Devils Island Said
to Have Been Planned as a â 
Pretext for Murder.
NEW YORK, July 21.â A Sun cable from
Paris says: The assertion that an at
tempt was recently made to assassinate
Dreyfus at Rennes causes the French
press to continue the publication of tho
treatment of Dreyfus during his confine
ment on Devils Island.
Upon one occasion, it is declared. Com
mandant Verillon, with the connivance of
the administration, organized a pretended
rescue, hoping that the warder would kill
Dreyfus if he attempted to seize the
chance to escape. The sham attempt to
rescue Dreyfus Is alleged to have been
instigated by minor French officials in
French Guiana.
A whaleboat was brought along Devils
Island In the middle of the night, a gun
was fired and much noise made.
Hearing the noise. Dreyfus' guard took
up a revolver and pointed it at the pris
oner, who. awakened, asked what was the
matter: but seeing the revolver, he said
nothing more.
In an official explanation, it is state
that the affair was, in reality, a test of
the vigilance of the warders.

LAWTON MAY COMMAND
THE FIELD OPERATIONS
NEW YORK. July 21.-A special to the
: Journal from Washington says: When the
rainy season ends and the fall campaign
In the Philippines begins General Otis
will be restricted to discharging the ad
ministrative duties of Governor General,
, while another army officer, probably Law
. ton. will be in command of the field op
i erations.
That prediction may be hazarded at this
; early day. Adjutant General Corbin, who
dislikes heroes, Is opposing the plan, but
; the sentiment among army men is rapidly
crystalizlng, and Republican politicians of
sense are of the same opinion. Nearly
all of the Republican leaders who have
called on the President during the last
four days have told him of the feeling in
their homes.
The criticisms of returning volunteer
are perhaps, the most potent influences
operating on th. Presidential mind.
These sentiments are reaching the Pres
ident by word of mouth, by telegram and
by letter. Army officers of discretion are
i writing privately to their friends in the
service here complaining of Otis' vacilla
tion, lack of decision and aparent Inability
to grasp the full military situation. Several
; of the writers have suggested that Otis
â  was harried and driven almost to distrac
: tion by foolish instructions from Wash
ington. This has reached the President's
, ears, and whether or not true he does
i not like the Imputation.

The Mayor wa.s constantly cheered by
the happy cadets, and on their departure
many utilized pie-plates as souvenirs and
had their host affix his autograph to them.
This kept him busy, as nearly fifty cadets
asked for his signature.

UNNAMED PEAK
IN THE CASCADES
A Discovery Made by
Mountain Climbers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. July 21. Seventeen moun
tain climbers, members of the Mazamas
from Oregon and Washington, have
just had a sensational experience in the
Cascades. They succeeded in planting
the American and English colors on the
summit of a hitherto unnamed peak,
5000 feet above the sea. -
Dr. E. Weldon Young of Seattle, who
led he ascending party, escaped by a
miracle from falling down a steep and
dangerous snow .field. The fortunate
presence of a thin barrier of bush and
dwarf cedars was all that prevented his
being dashed headlong on the rocks be
low.
Dr. Young's terrific toboggan slide of
CCO feet and his marvel escape frorri
death or serious injury was the chief
feature of the ascent. A perfect day
for mountain climbing and the fact that
â¢he leaders in the expedition pronounced
the view from the summit the finest
ever attained In the history of the
Mazamas were the other features.
Clinging to the lifeline and to the al
most perpendicular side of the peak,
â¢,>ith less than two feet on either side
between them and the abyss 2000 feet
below, the Mazamas conducted their
traditional mountain peak exercises by
the breaking of a bottle of wine. The
mountain; which overlooks the Horse
â¢: hoe Basin, was christened Sahale
hinbok (meaning high).
It was while crossing a. snowfield at
nn elevation of 4.00 feet that Dr. Young
came perilously near losing his life.
He was searching for a way to reach
th" bench of rocks above the field,
while the party waited below. The life
nized with a medal. It is only a leather
one, but if it was of gold and studded
with diamonds the auburn-haired man
with the high sounding title would not
take more pleasure In displaying it. It
reposes on his brawny breast, where it
was placed by a committee of ladles in
the presence of the staff officers of the
regiment. On the medal is the following
inscription: "Cum Laude. Presented to
Sergeant 'Brindle' McGinn in recognition
of his heroism in saving the lives of three
young ladies of Santa Cruz. July 20, 1899.
A reception was given in honor of the
hero at the home of the Morriseys on the
Soquel road last night. In making the
presentation speech Miss Kitty Lawlor
of San Francisco told how "Brindle" at
the risk of his own life sprang forward
and prevented a phaeton being overturned
b\ a fractious horse. Her narration
proved a stirring one and her auditors
gazed in admiration at the young sold;,
Among the officers who witnessed the
presentation were: Majors McGloin and
McCarthy. Captains Duffy. Hopper, Mc-
Carthy, Monohan; Bannon and Sullivan,
Lieutenants Mahoney and Watts, Ser
geants James Frank Dougherty and
â¢â¢Hibernian" Owens.
A party consisting of members of Com

Those who went were First Sergeant Mc-
Kinley, Sergeant Leonard, Sergeant Sulli
van. Corporal Byington and Privates Do
lan, Bvington, Joseph O'Brien, Joseph
Sullivan, Rothberg Herring, O'Connell
and McN'enomy. The day's outing was
enlivened by a boat race between Pri
vates Sullivan and O'Brien and Sergeant
McKinley and Corporal Byington. The
latter won because of a dispute between
the former crew as to which one would
have the honor of rowing the boat to vic
tory.
J. Tahan*ev* of Company 11 dreamed last

upward. He started diagonally across
the field, when he missed his footing
and shot down the slope with terrific
velocity, feet foremost. A thin fringe
of dwarf cedars and snruce lay in
Young's path. He grabbed one of these
as he shot down the mountain and then
disappeared from view. There was one
moment of silence and then his cheery
voice saying, "I'm all right," came
from the snow-lined thicket and the
Mazamas breathed again.

TALLULAH, La., July 21.â For many
weeks a lot of goats, belonging to Frank
Defatta have been sleeping and run
ning on the gallery of Dr. J. Ford
Hodge's office and residence. The doc
tor on numerous occasions requested
the owner to keep his goats away, but
he would not do it, and on the night of
the 19th Dr. Hodge shot one of the
goats on his gallery. Early on the
morning of the 20th Frank Defatta
came to Hodge's office and protested.
The doctor promptly ordered him to
leave, and he left, mumbling some
thing the doctor did not understand.
About sundown on the evening of the
20th. as .Dr. Hodge and Mr. Kauffman
were passing Joe Defatta's store,
Charles Defatta came out and said,
"You shot my goat," and struck the
doctor. Hodge attempted to repel the
attack by striking back with his fist,
but, finding the Sicilian too much for
him, attempted to get at his pistol. Joe
Defatta, who was at the door, leveled
a double-barreled shotgun and fired
two shots at the doctor, striking him in

! ties they joined in the chase and sue- :
ceeded in arresting and disarming
Frank Defatta, Sy Deberroch and John
Cereno after a hard struggle. John
Cereno made a lunge at one of the :
i crowd with one of his long knives and
was promptly knocked down by a by- ,
: stander. . I
Immediately the Sheriff with his
posse went to the house where Charles
and Joe Defatta were barricaded, sur
rounded the square, and, after batter-
I ing down the doors of the house, suc
ceeded in taking Charles Defatta. Not
finding Joe In there the crowd began
a search of the premises, going thence
! to the large dwelling immediately be
hind the shop, which was owned by the :
Defattas There they found Joe hid- .
den under the chimney. He was
promptly taken "out and the Sheriff
started to the jail with Charles and j
i Joe. ~
When he got to the Courthouse

! overpowered the Sheriff, and after a se-
I vere struggle took Joe and Charles De
fatta .'.own in the field to the slaughter

j for slaughtering beeves.
Joe denied the shooting and accused

brother, but said Frank Defatta and Sy
Deberroch were the cause of the
trouble.
The crowd then adjourned to the Jail,
overpowered the jailer and deputies,
took the keys, went in and brought out
Sy Deberroch, Frank Defatta and John

in the jail yard. Not a shot was fired
and the crowd was quiet, but very de-

A good many citizens pleaded for the
lives of the Sicilians, but without avail,
as the people were much wrought up,
this gang being charged with a num
ber of outrages that have recently oc
curred In the neighborhood. About
three years ago, Frank Defatta shot
and killed a negro for picking up a
; watermelon which Frank had for sale,
and about a year ago Joe Defatta shot
' and killed Pat Matthews, landing
keeper at Milliken's Bend. La., as he
was passing his store. This murder
'< was due to .'i trivial quarrel the two
1 men had about some freight, and De
fatta was cleared by some technicality
of the law. The Sicilians had frequent
ly boasted that they would do as they
pleased and their money would clear
them. The people believe the five had

shooting. Joe Defatta's gun was found
on the counter, with a box of shells by
it.
Dr. J. Ford Hodge is a prominent
physician and is parish Coroner. He ;
moved to this place from Calhoun
about two years ago. He is badly
wounded, and the doctors say he can

NO FRIENDS
FOR OTIS AMONG
THE VOLUNTEERS
He Is Always Too Late to
Meet an Emergency,
the Men Say.
Answers "Round Robin" of Cor
respondents and Wants to
Raise a Cavalry Regiment.
NOT a soldier who came back on; the transport Indiana, which
reached this port to-day, has a good word to say for General
Otis. The consensus of opinion is that the man is not fitted for
the place and that had General Miles or any other able general
been in the Philippines the war would have been over long ago.
"General Otis thinks he can do everything better than anybody
else, and in consequence he makes a mess of everything," said one of the
men yesterday. "He will not allow a subordinate to do anything, not
even make a copy of his dispatches. The result is that he is doing
some little clerical work when he ought to be engaged in urgent busi
ness. Then when he gets around to the urgent work it is too late. It
is always too late with Otis, and in consequence money and men are
being wasted through his bungling."
CALL HEADQUARTERS,
WELLINGTON HOTEL,
WASHINGTON, July 21.â
It is learned to-day that
Major General Otis had
cabled to the War Department
a recommendation that he be al
lowed to organize a skeleton cav
alry regiment in the Philippines,
to be filled by recruits from the
United States. Upon his recom
mendation Captain James Lock
ett of the Fourth Cavalry will be
selected to command the new
regiment, which will be desig
nated as the Eleventh Volunteer
C*_ v___r_f
Colonel Thomas Ward, assist
ant adjutant general, told me he
had at the Presidio of San Fran
cisco all the men required to in
crease the enlisted strength of
the eight troops of the Third
Cavalry to be sent to the Phil
ippines to 120 men each. The
troops to go are A, C, D, E, I â 
X, L and M. Troops B, G, H and
I will be collected at Fort Myer,
which will be the home station
for the regiment of cavalrymen
who will be at General Otis' dis
posal when the dry season opens.
The War Department has is
sued a statement, quoting certain
dispatches from General Otis, in
answer to the press' correspond
ents' "round robin."
The text of the statement is as .fol
low* â¢ "General Otis, in a dispatch un
der date of July 20, says that the press
correspondents demand permission to
cable that official reports sent misrep
resented conditions. This was denied.
They then demanded the privilege to
send without reservation, facts ascer
tained by them and their opinions.
This wars granted, if the public inter
ests were not imperiled. This answer
was not satisfactory and the corre
: spondents therefore sent by mail to
: Hongkong. General Otis says he is not
conscious of sending misrepresenta
tions, but thinks that his dispatches at
! times have been to conservative. The
I press affair appeared to be a threat.
When the correspondents were asked
jto state wherein General Otis' dis
' patches were misleading they offered
j nothing tangible except that his con
clusions were unwarranted.. When
I told that they were disregarding mili
tary authority, it was apparent that
j they courted martyrdom, which it was
unwise to give them." _
In a later dispatch General Otis says
i that the charges made by the press
i correspondents are untrue. He adds
that the most harmonious relations ex
ist between the army and the navy.
He gives the following extract from a
letter just received from a leading Fili
pino at Tarlac. which is the center of
the main insurgent army:
"For some days I have been trying
ito leave this band of thieves. Am
watched so closely it is impossible to
< leave. A great many of the people
1 here long for the American troops to
advance, for every one Is desperate
: with so much savagery committed by
I Aguinaldo's army."
Captain Barker of the navy, who
succeeded" Admiral Dewey in command
of the fleet, in sending the report of the
commander of the Yorktown to the
Nay Department, makes this indorse
ment: "I am pleased to note the cor
dial co-operation of the army and
navy."
As bearing upon the statement that
â  the operations of the navy had been
minimized, it may be stated that Gen-
I eral Otis has repeate recognized the
work of the navy, as for example in his
dispatch of June 15 last, in which he
says: "The navy aided greatly on' the
shore of the bay. landing forces occa
sionally," and again, urrder date of
I July 9, "the army and the navy are in
; hearty accord and the best of feeling
i prevails."

a large scale or advances covering many
miles will be Impossible for a long time.
Many miles of the country are flooded to
a depth of three or four feet. The Para
naque bridge, which was considered im
pregnable, has been swept away, cutting
off temporarily the garrisons of "imus and
Bacoor from communication with Manila,
In the circumstances it. would be impossi
ble to move wagon trains, as the trails
have become doubtful. Pack mules will be
utilized if it should be Impossible for sol
diers to make marches. The officials will
have their hands full for some time in ar

and in settling the regulars who are re
placing them.
GENERAL ANDERSON SAYS
* HE WAS MISQUOTED
CINCINNATI, July 21. -General T. M.
Anderson, commanding the Department
of the Lakes, who was quoted yesterday
as saying if he had not been held back
he would have finished the Filipino war
with his own division, stated that he had
been misquoted. General Anderson made
the following statement:
"I said that my division or Lawton's
could have defeated the organized forces
but no one could tell how long predatory
warfare would last. I said that a division
commander, whose business it was to
fight, did not take the same view as a
governor general, restrained by political
and diplomatic considerations. The term
politics was not used in a party sense."
BLAMES OFFICIALS FOR
HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
Mrs. Berrill Files ah Affidavit With
the Commission in
Lunacy.
SACRAMENTO, July 21.-The widow of
C. L. Berrill, a San Franciscan, who com
mitted suicide at the Stockton Insane Asy
lum in April, to-day filed with the State
Commission In Lunacy an affidavit in
which she charges that her husband was
"railroaded" to the asylum and that the
San Francisco Insanity Commissioners
were responsible for his death In that they
did not order that proper precautions be
taken to prevent his suicide.
Berrill was employed in Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s Bank in Frultvale. He became sud
denly insane on April 28, and was taken
to the San Francisco Receiving Hospital
While crossing the bay he attempted to
jump overboard. The following day he
was examined by the Insanity Commis
sioners and ordered committed to the hos
pital at Stockton. Mrs. Berrill claims she
was notified of the examination too late
to enable her to attend, and she charges
that because of the haste ln committing
her husband no evidence regarding his
suicidal mania was brought out. The San
Francisco officials explain that their haste
was due to the fact that the following day
was Sunday and the next day Dewey day
and that lf Berrill had not been sent at
once he would have had to remain forty
eight hours in a place where there was
not adequate protection.
VALLEY ROAD EXTENSION.
First Rails Will Be Put Down Within

STOCKTON, July 21.-H. E. Barber,
who has the contract for the Santa Fe
roadbed through Antioch, reports splen
did progress. He is authority for the
statement that the rails will soon be go
ing down on Point Richmond extension
Barber said to-day:
"I believe the first rails and ties will
be set some time next week. According
to my information, the start will be made
at Antioch and work will progress both
waysâ toward, this city and toward the
bay. As soon as the road is ready one
of the engines will be taken over the
Southern Pacific tracks to Antioch and
switched onto the Valley road and con
struction will begin in earnest. Work will
progress in this direction the faster, I be
lieve, as the railroad needs a great deal
of earth for tills and will want to get
out on the plains where the steam shovel
may be used to advantage."

WOODLAND, July 21.âNotwithstand
ing Mrs. Lederer's age and the number
and horrible character of her wounds the
Indications of improvement are both sur
prising and gratifying .to the attending
physician. She rested well last nght, her
pulse and appetite are good, to-day; she

Her recovery now seems almost certain.
Lederer knows this, but continues to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE, July 21.â Baron de Staal
presided at the plenary session of the
International Peace Conference to-day to
place the final seal upon the labors of the
first committee. The first point of M.
Karnebeck's report, dealing with prohi
bition of dropping explosives from bal
loons, was unanimously agreed to.
i The second point, prohibiting the use of
asphyxiating projectiles, was agreed to
by all except the "United States and Great
Britain, whose abstination nullifies the
agreement of the others.
The third point, which relates to ex
panding bullets, occupied the major part
| of the sitting, owing to the question of
dumdum bullets used by the British
j army. Sir Julian Pauncefote expressed
! regret that the plenary session had been
|so suddenly summoned, as the British
I Government had Intended to make a
' statement regarding the dumdum bullet.
; The "conference agreed to leave the mml
l utes of the session open for the Insertion
â  of the British statement.
Andrew D. White, the head of the
''â  United States delegation, then made an
important speech in opposition to the pro
' hibition of such bullets as the dumdum.
Mr. White's argument made a great im
: pression upon the delegates, and especial
ly when he explained that the adoption
I of the proposal as submitted would not
\ prevent the use of another bullet which
! had already been Invented and which
1 would attain the same end as the dum
! dum but in a more cruel manner. The
new 'missile, Mr. White said, was outside
the specific definitions of the present pro
captain Crosier, the military member
of the United States delegation, proposed
as a substitute the following: The use of
i bullets should be prohibited which inflict
i unnecessarily cruel wounds, such as ex
plosive bullets and in general every kind
i of bullet exceeding ..the limits necessary
! to put a man immediately hors de com-
A* long discussion ensued as to whether
a vote should be taken upon the original
proposal or that of Captain Crozier. The
latter was finally chosen to be voted on.
Sir Julian Pauncefote announced that he
would accept Captain Crozier's proposal,
but it was rejected by a vote of 17 to 8.
M Van Karnebeck's version was then
adopted Great Britain and the United
; States alone voting against it. and the

ASSESSMENTS ON YOLO
REAL ESTATE RAISED
Banks of the County Will Fight r._
Attempt to Tax First Mort
gage Bonds.
WOODLAND, July 21.â At the flrst
meeting of the County Board of Equali
zation it was intimated that there would
be reductions in the assessed* valuation
of the farming lands of the county, ag
gregating more than a million of dollars.
The board adjourned sine die on Thurs
day night. The result of its labors fur
nished a genuine surprise. Instead of
there being a material reduction, the roll
has been largely increased and the bulk
of the increase has been made on the
lowlands along the Sacramento River, 're
clamation districts and swamp land sur
veys. The increased assessment on real
property and improvements aggregates
$221,564. The decreases aggregate $18,243.
leaving a net Increase of $203,319. This
big increase in the assessment of real es
tate is due in a great measure to the ex
penditure of less than $50,000 in river im
provement' from the river at Elkhorn
ranch to the jetty system at Newtown
shoals. "i
The assessment on telephone line, boxes,
etc., was increased from $15,000 to $46,
--653.
Another big Increase was made which
raises a point that is new in this State
and the legality of the assessment will
be judicially determined. The Bank of
Woodland is the owner of first mortgage
bonds of California corporations valued
at $30,000; bonds of municipal corporations
of the State valued at l.'tt.OOO; bonds Is
sued by railroads and btner corporations
In other States valued at $121,000. Under
protest, the cashier testified that the cor
poration owned these bonds, but declare.!
they were not subject to taxation In Cali
fornia because they were not now and
had not been in this State. The District
Attorney advised the board that the
bonds were liable for assessment, and the
Assessor was ordered to list them to the
bank. An effort was made to levy an
assessment on the bonds for I*9B, but as
the Assessor has already turned the roll
over to the Auditor he has lost his right
to make the double assessment. The
bank will pay the tax under protest and
sue to recover.
DETERMINED TO DIE.
WOODLAND. July 21.â A Davisville
special to the Democrat says: Simon
! Wermmer, a German cook employed on
; the farm of Fred Wilger, east of this

I morning to commit suicide. He took a
big draught of carbolic acid and was dis
covered in great agony, but before the
deadly poison did Its work effectually. He
was hurried to Davisville, where prompt
medical aid saved his life.
After Wermmer had recovered from
the effects of the poison he told the phy
sician that this was his fourth attempt
,to commit suicide. He is about 50 years
of age. and has been in the employ of
I Mr. Wilger two months. Prior to that
time he was in the employ of John Henle

It was by far the largest of all the large

was given the affair last night by reason
of the fact that the professional cham

Many of the best people in this city

of the public and monetary benefit to
herself was a great surprise to them.
The fact of the matter is. Miss Kil
patrick is hardly less surprised than
her .frier.dr. She .id not seek stage
life; it was forced upon her, and the
results have been so satisfying that
she has decided to stay with It.
*'It whs this way." she said. "I went
to the World's Fair and for the first
time saw ladies riding the bicycle. I
was always very fond of all kinds of
sports, and decided to try the wheel.
Soon plain r-.ling was not venturesome
er.ou-;h for my daring California blood
and 1 Started in to do some trick rid-
Ing. My ability to handle the bicycle
soon came to the ears of the well-
known firm, and they built me a
wheel and asked me to give an exhlbl-
ball.
From the first I was a success. Shortly after the music halls made me an
offer. I accepted and have been with It eyer since." *-â¢',tf.'-:V

WATER AND DITCH RIGHTS.
Los Angeles Loses Its Case Against
Pomefoy and Hooker.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
decision of the lower court in the case of
the city of Eos Angeles against A. K.
Pomeroy and. J. D. Hooker. It was an
action to enjoin the defendants from di
verting water from a certain ditch, from
which the city has been drawing a por
tion of its water supply. The dam and
ditch are on property owned by Pomeroy
and Hooker. In 1843 a Mexican grant was
given to ope of the Mexican settlers to
divert a part of tie water of the Eos An
geles River Into a ditch. The water
rights passed down to the city and the
ownership of the land to the defendants.
In 1893 an agreement between the parties
in interest terminated, and the city ceas
ing to pay for the use of the water di
version; the defendants turned tin- stream,
after using what they required, back into
the natural channel of the river.
Then it was that the injunction pro
ceedings were begun, and in the lower
court the city won. The higher court,
however, takes a different view of the
equity and law of the matter, holding that
while" the city and all below the property
owned by the defendants have riparian
rights the city cannot fore,. Pomeroy and
Hooker to allow the water-to run in their
ditch over their land. While the city has
a right to the water, it has no right to the
use of the land. The cause was remanded.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET SHOWS
IMPROVEMENT
Brokers Expect Early
Revival.
â , â
ONE BIG SALE IS REPORTED
â 
â â¦ â
T. J. REAGAN PURCHASES DOWN
TOWN PROPERTY.
â¢
Loan of Nearly One Hundred Thou
sand Dollars Is Made by the
Whitcomb Estate at
Six Per Cent.
THE midsummer quiet and dullness
of the realty market was 'broken
d"uring thje past week by the sale
of property on the southeast cor
ner of O'Farreli and Powell streets
to T. J. Reegan for $63,500. This is the
same property recently purchased by M.
A. Gunst for $35,500 from the Donald C.
McÃauer estate. It has a frontage of
eighty feet on Powell street and twenty
five feet on. O'Farreil and Is occupied by
a two-story building:. The sale was made
through A. M. Speck & Co.
While this is the largest real estate
transaction reported for several weeks me
past week shows a slight improvement
over preceding weeks, several fairly good
Bales being put through, Including one by
A. M Speck & Co., who sold the old hotel
property on Turk street near Market for
W. O. Watson to A. W. Demlng. The lot
is j54:4"__137:6, occupied by a number of
frame buildings, and the price paid is said
i,, 'Â- in the neighborhood of $40,000. The
smaller sales have been quite numerous
and the brokers predict a brisk business
after the close of the summer vacation
period. This feeling is in a large measure
due to the action of the Hibernia Bank
in reducing Its rate of interest on loans
to 6 per cent. Since the notice of the.re
duction was issued 'the bank has loaned
about $30,000 in small amounts and the
Whitcomb estate advanced $95,000 . to
Thomas J. Reagan at the same rate, se
cured by a mortgage on the property at the
corner of Powell and O'Farreil streets.

f\ GRfIVE LOCAL ISSUE.
AX obligation of the most serious character has
been placed upon the reputable Republican
voters of this city. The future government of
San Francisco will be determined by the decent citi
zens of the city. Upon the shoulders of men who
have something at stake and are interested in pro
moting the welfare of the municipality rests the re
sponsibility of deciding whether our future local gov
ernment shall be good or bad. The primary law has
broken the power of professional politicians to con
trol- conventions and dictate nominations.
Every voter has now the privilege to participate in
political affairs as a free agent, exercising his preroga
tive of individual opinion. With this privilege has
come an obligation which every- Republican voter is
in duty bound to satisfy. The local Republican or
ganization has decided to abide- by the strict letter of
the law. It has repudiated the crafty, boss-conceived
scheme of a blanket ticket. It has pledged an abso
lute precinct representation throughout the city and
has won for every voter the' right to express his
opinion with his vote in primary politics.
A Republican club has been organized in every
Assembly District of San Francisco; and the way is
clear for every Republican to make himself felt in the
government of the city. It is the duty, therefore, of
every Republican to enroll himself in his Assembly
District club and participate in those affairs that lead
up to conventions and the nomination of municipal
candid;
There is no longer an excuse for decent men to
permit professional politicians to rule San Francisco.
The primary law has placed local government in the
hands of those that are best qualified to administer it.
If reputable Republicans do not. obey their duty the
responsibility of bad local government will be upon
them and not upon the men who have won corrupt
power through influences that the primary law has
destroyed. The issue is one that cannot be avoided.
Good citizens must accept their responsibilities.
THE FREE HARBOR CONTEST.
BY all odds the most important event in the
history of Los Angeles is the long struggle for
the construction of a harbor "at San Pedro,
ending, as it did, in a victory which assures to that
city a port of entry which virtually makes Los An
geles a seaport, and one of the foremost on the Pa
cific Coast
The contest against the powerful opposition of the
Southern Pacific Company attracted the attention
and enlisted the sympathies of all Californians. Its
course and character are, therefore, familiar enough
at present, and are not likely to be forgotten by this
generation.. For the purpose of preserving the story
so that it may be fully understood by those who are
to profit in future by the harbor, the history of the
struggle has been written by Charles Dwight Wil
lard and published in an attractive volume hand
somely illustrated. . The work is a valuable addition
to the record of recent events, and may be accounted
a permanent contribution to the history of the State.
The next time Tammany has a banquet Mr. Hogg
of Texas will be left to rest alone in his own little pen

kidnaping the tiger is not one the contemplation of
which Mr. Croker could safely subject his nerves to.
a second time.
Reports from many localities show that a large per
centage of those wounded in the recent Fourth of
July celebration have contracted lockjaw. What a
pity so few of them were politicians and prize-fighters.
It is not to be supposed for a moment, although the
Southern Pacific roadbed over the Alameda marsh
exhibits a tendency to drop out of sight, that it is a
part of Huntington's sinking fund.
It might improve the situation in the Philippines
during the rainy season somewhat if we had a general

STRIKING PfIRfILLELS.
THE Post is struck by the Parallel of Imperialism
in the United States and the imperial career of
Rome. The home-coming of the volunteers is
' the analogue of a Roman triumph. There is regret
! that no more spoils are brought, nor captives to gloat
over. The Post says the Roman Silurians opposed
the policy of conquest and deprecated the triumphal
displays with the captured kings and queens and
treasures and slaves which the returning legions
brought back to Rome. These Roman Silurians,
thinks the Post, resembled what it calls the "dough
faces" of to-day. 1 They saw in each conquest only
; subsequent disaster, and never lost a chance to de
clare that the policy of conquest was a subversion of
; the institutions of their country.
The Post is right: There is a striking parallel, and
: if it will read a bit deeper in Roman history it will
1 discover that every prophecy made by such Roman
Silurians as Cato and Cicero came true. "The illus
-1 trious reign of Augustus" was not over before the
| glorious structure of empire begun by his uncle Julius
1 began to crumble and the liberties of the Roman citi
zens had been wrested from them by the legions. At
i first, when the captives were led through the streets
of Rome chained to the chariot wheels of their. cap
tors, the Roman citizens thronged the way and bel
lowed "Woe to the conquered." But at last there was
' written in history "Woe to the conqueror."
j â¢ The policy of Roman expansion, which had ex
| pression in the campaigns of Julius Caesar against
peoples who had never wronged a Roman, reacted
\ when the Roman conscience revolted and found ex-
I pression in the Senate. Vercingetorix and his chief
' tains had stoutly defended their liberty and their
i homes against the Roman invader, and the Senate,
I impressed by the spectacle, began to flinch from the
! slaughter of others for doing just what the Romans
would if their soil were invaded. It was then that
Caesar betrayed his country and, leaving his own
1 province, crossed its legal boundary, the Rubicon,
and marched on Rome. The imperial policy abroad
I made necessary the abridgment of liberty at home.
I The ancient world understood this as perfectly face to
face as we do in the perspective of history.
Caesar's act was known to mean the downfall of
' the Roman commonwealth, the end of all attempts at
| internal reform and the destruction of Roman lib
i erty. Plutarch records all these impressions and pic
tures the traitor, Julius, the night before he crossed
the Rubicon, tossing in fitful sleep and dreaming that
:he deflowered his own mother. No further record is
' needed to prove the current estimate of his act. Then
followed the expiring tragedy of patriotism, the as
sassination of Julius, the murder of Cicero, and in
due time the dawning of the glories of the Augustan
age. Empire flourished briefly, but its subjects, car
ried captive to Rome, learned tactics and longed fcr
! their native hills as Spartacus did for the green valleys
lof Thrace. Hermann rallied the German tribes, and
when Varus marched against him with the flower of
! the Roman legions, the invincible Latins, who had
made conquests abroad and suppressed by slaughter
all. opposition at home, the seasoned soldiers of the
empire, were powerless against German valor, and in
the frightful carnage of the Teutoberger Wald the
pride of empire was laid low and it- power was
,' broken. Then it was. .-aid that a statue of Victory, out
side the Eternal City, which pointed the road to Ger
many, turned on its pedestal and pointed toward
Rome, and Augustus beat his head against the walls
of his palace and cried, "Emilius Varus, give me back
Imy legions; give me back my legions."
Then how rapid the fall of everything gracious and
glorious in Rome! With empire came the purple and
its muniments, and after Augustus these were seized
and sold by the mercenary legions to the highest
bidder, and the stench of the rotting of Rome filled
the world, and its spume remains to defile history.
Cicero, Cato, the Silurians, all were gone, buUtheir
warnings to this day impress the conscience of the
world far more than the decayed glories of empire in
fluence man's love for pageantry and display.
Indeed, the parallel is striking. Witness the denial
iof free speech, the violation of the privacy of the
: mails, the rigid censorship of all news from the dis-
t ant seat of a war of conquest that Congress never,
f declared, the trampling on the constitution and pro
| posal to punish citizens who speak of liberty, the in
â  solence of military officers and their interference in
j civil affairs. Witness also the cunning deceit with
1 which the servants of the people meet the "round
; robin" of the reputable war correspondents in Man
i ila. The censor cuts all the facts out of news dis
' patches and then himself sends such dispatches as he
chooses to Washington, suppressing the truth and
lying to the people. To the charge of the cor
respondents the authorities answer that they "have
j made public the official dispatches," and that is con
. sidered an answer to the charge that the truth is kept
from :he people, when the charge is that these same
! officihl dispatches are official lies, coined to deceive
the country. All these things are part of the Post's
"striking parallel," but they are no more a part of it
than the end that waits upon imperialism, the pit into
which it falls. Jefferson said that this republic was to
be a new departure, a Government that would eschew
the criminal ambitions and bloody aspirations which
had made Europe a hell. He and the fathers desired to
avoid the striking parallel which impresses the Post
iso favorably, and they must rank, therefore, with
Cato, Cicero, the Roman Silurians and the present
"doughfaces."
THE MENDACIOUS EXAMINER.
THE traditional gobbler with its tail stretched
and its ruffles distended in imbecile antagonism
to the universe is a fit emblem of the Exam
iner, which struts and chuckles over its relations to
the fusion Democracy, now apparently in the final
throes of dissolution. In its editorial columns of
yesterday that organ of vicious idiocy in its language
is unusually truculent and mendacious. Among other
things it claims the existence in San Francisco of "a
strong public sentiment in favor of the Democracy,"
and proceeds to assail The Call, in terms that invite
a retort which will be temporarily restrained, for an
alleged connection with the Huntington railroad
monopoly, typified in the person of William F.
Herrin.
The Examiner consciously and deliberately lies.
But that is a mere incident in its infamous career.
That such a public expression of individual egotism
and vanity should have ever posed as the representa
tive of any approach toward political reform is one of
the unsolved riddles of paresis. When the Democratic
party, as established by Thomas .Jefferson and inocu
lated with the stern virility of Andrew Jackson,
existed, it was the victim of a hundred mean and. sor
did treacheries upon the part of its pretentious or
gan. When the mongrel fusion between the Democ
racy and the Populists or socialists. was embodied in
the Chicago platform and in the hybrid State enun
ciation of last year, it- was again false to every prin
ciple it had pretended to revere. When the Hunting
ton corruptionists sought to impose Daniel M. Burns
as a Federal Senator upon a disgusted people it
sneakingly used its entire influence to promote the
THE SATST FRANCISCO CALL, .SATURDAY, JUJLY 22. 1899.
outrage. On the recent question of the. valuation of !
property for the purpose of. municipal taxation it â¢
patted inequality upon the back and pitted its chosen
Assessor against the integrity of the Board of Super
visors. Years ago it was bought, paid for and re
pudiated by Mr. Huntington, and ever since its stupid
revenges and its morbid thirst for restoration to
monopolistic favor have been visible through all its
pretensions and through all its hypocrisies.
When the Examiner attempts to repudiate the oli
garchical control of the local Democratic organiza
tion through a combination between its managing
editor, Sam Rainey, and possibly the resuscitated j
Chris Buckley, it flies in the face of incontestable facts j
and of firm public opinion. Upon this point the â 
issue may safely be left where it is. But when that j
promoter of "internal policies" in language of a per
sonal quality or in any language seeks to identify The ;
Call with William F. Herrin it impudently parades a |
falsehood that will be resented by every decent news- ,
paper reader and citizen in the State. In order to ;
meet any possible suspicion of undue acerbity we j
quote one sentence in its own words: "We have no
doubt that Spreckels and Herrin would like to put
felons and fugitives from justice in a position of
prominence in the local Democracy." . This is a j
choice specimen of vulgar mendacity. The Exam
iner has toiled and struggled to secure the ascend
ency of corruptionists in the Republican party, not
merely to aid particular schemes inimical to the pub
lic welfare, but to further the project, long ago de
tected by The Call and in which William F. Herrin is
deeply implicated, to turn the State over to the ftt
sionists in 1900. The Call, without a single break,
and it may be said with a success that marks the com
mencement of a new era in California, has resisted j
every form of monopolistic aggression, whether it i
originated with Mr. Huntington or with any of his j
associates or tributaries. It has also welcomed and !
commended every evidence of independence and of
manhood among Republicans and Democrats as mdi- j
eating a revival of the true conception of American J
citizenship. The independence that the Examiner :
has falsely professed The Call has actually manifested
in a succession of controversies in which, almost for
the first time in the history of California, the intelli
gence and the respectability of the people have been
triumphant.
The Examiner is one of "the bushwhackers of j
politics." It has worn about every costume through !
which the meanest hypocrisy and the most unblush
ing falsehood could be detected. If fusion Democ- .
racy. not constitutionally revived it would have \
been destroyed by the organ that represents it. The j
Examiner-Rainey-Buckley association will not es-. I
cape its just fate under the hat of Mayor Phelan or by ;
hanging on to the coat-tails of Assessor Dodge.
BY the death of Robert G. Ingersoll the country
loses one of the most gifted orators of the time
â one who, had he possessed a .better balanced
brain, would probably have been among the foremost
of our statesmen.
His career is a striking proof that the most bril
liant talents, even when accompanied by industry,
courage and energy, fail to accomplish much if they
are dominated by a fixed idea, which colors, exag
gerates and distorts everything presented either to the
mental or the moral vision.
:rsoll was sincere in all the purposes of his life, j
and at all time had the courage of his convictions.
When the war broke out he entered the army and
served with distinction. During the reconstruction
period he was a stanch upholder of the policies of the
Republican party and was one of . its most potent
stump speakers. His speech in nomination of j
Blame for the Presidency at the convention of 1876 |
is one of the classics of American oratory. It made
his fame national and hi.* name familiar in every
household. He was the. bright particular star of the :
campaign that followed, and had he possessed a bet- j
ter balanced intellect he might have aspired. to the
highest honors with a fair expectation of attaining
them.
He could never get rid, however, of the fixed idea
that the Christian religion is a cruel, unreasonable J
survival of barbaric superstition. On that subject he
was almost insane. The defect wrecked his career, |
though it did not prevent him from attaining wealth
and .something of fame. His life was stormy and full
of bitter controversies, but all antagonisms are ended
now, and the country over his tomb will remember
nothing but his courage, his eloquence and his |
patriotism. .
AT the first blush the country will put only one
construction upon the resignation of Alger.
It will be taken as expression of the Presi
dent's disapproval of the management of the War
Department, and a response to the popular demand
caused by the revelations with beef and other army
scandals. There is at present no doubt that the
resignation was demanded. This will not wait long
for confirmation, and when it is known there will be
wrought a change in public opinion. To demand the
resignation now will be taken as expression of the
administration's need of a soapegoat and of a timely
diversion of public attention from the errors and dis
asters of imperialism in the tropics. It can hardly he
said that Alger's beef record and his differences with
General Miles have caused this very late demand for
the purgation of the Cabinet of his presence. The
President, having laboriously constructed two com
missions of inquiry to cleanse Alger of blame, and
having taken upon himself the sins of Eagan, the
country will slowly but surely reach the conclusion
that the general policies of the administration need
to ripen in security from public attention before they
can be trusted to command public favor, and there
fore it is necessary to give the people something to
occupy them.
Official etiquette closes Alger's. mouth until he lays
down his portfolio, as it did John Sherman's, but then
he may be expected to talk, and many things now
greatly dark will be illuminated.
The resignations of Alger and Sherman are two in
cidents that may well impress the public mind. In
politics and their party they were enemies more bitter
than Conkling and Blame. In his book Sherman ac
cused Alger, point blank, of buying negro votes in
the convention which had been pledged to Sherman
for the Presidency, thus defeating the Ohio states
man. For two men in such relation to amicably con
cur in official contact was impossible. However, each
has left the Cabinet for reasons in no way instigated
by the other, but for causes inhering in the policies
of the President and the necessities of their pursuit.
This being true, the country will listen with interest
to what Alger has to say. ' '
The parable of the loaves and the fishes has been
eclipsed, if you will take the Examiner's word for it.

A DISSOLVING CABINET.
ORIGIN OF THE "ROUND ROBIN."
The Famous Protest of the Newspaper Men
at Manila Was Planned on Lines Made
Use Of by the Ancients.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 20.
Editor Callâ The newspapers refer tothe united protest of. the correspondents
at Manila against the strict censorship of General Otis as a "roand robin. l na\e
sought information from a number of friends as to the origin of this peculiar ex
pression, but in vain, and now ask you to give it in your valuable columns tor our
benefit, and also undoubtedly for many other readers of The Call. __â __

[The round robin is a circle divided from the center, like the famed Arthur 3
round table, whence it is thought to have originated. In each compartment of the
robin is _ signature, so that the entire circle when filled exhibits a list, without
priority being given to any name. It is stated, however, that the round robin,
without which a sailor would think himself deprived of his right of petition, was
first invented in Athens on the occasion of the conspiracy of Aristogeiton and
Harmodus against the tyranny of Pisistratide. The Romans, in imitation of the
Greeks, not to indicate their preference to any. either among their guests or
friends or slaves, wrote their names in a circle in such a manner that it was Im
possible to say which was first, second or last in their estimation.
Sir W. Forbes in Boswell's life of Dr. Johnson says: "This jeu d'esprit had its
use one day in 1776 at a dinner at our friend -Sir Joshua Reynolds'. All the com
pany present except myself were friends and acquaintances of Dr. Goldsmith.

WITH TUNEFUL
"OLIVETTE"
AT THE GRAND
A' â . .â¢ â  -- rformance is of'
N excellent performance is often due
to the stimulus given the artists
by a large audience and to the cred
it of the Grand Opera-house be it
said they sing as well to half a
house as to "standing room only." If put
to the test they would no doubt do their
utmost to please the well-known "five" of
Mai ready.
"Olivette" does not seem to have found
! favor with the public: It is tuneful, too,
and merry; has four good characters,
\ some fine choruses, picturesque scenery,
graceful dancing, rather pretty costumes
j and many a laughter provoking incident.
There is nothing to prevent its being
! kindly accepted but the dialogue, and
i surely that with its business is length-
I ened "beyond the limit of patience. The
second act is practically nothing elseâ a
solo or two, a duet and a beautiful one,
a quintet and then dialogue and horse
1 play until the sight of the entering chorus
i is bailed with delight, because we know
lit signals the fall of the curtain. Why
1 would it not be a happy idea to let a dis-
I appearing chorus occasionally indicate a
! curtain fall? The thought Is suggested
j by the grouping in the first act, where
j the chorus turns Its back upon the audi
ence and looks out to sea. It is a very
excellent and effective piece of stage
management.
The dominating figure in the opera is
poor, woebegone Coqu'lelicot. Humor of
the broad sort has set its hall mark upon
Mr. Wolf, and when kept out of military
trappings he easily stands well to the
front as a fun maker. He maintains the
I character rigidly, even In the matter of
i encore, for these he accepts with a bow
I and smile of true henchman stupidity.
Arthur Wooley plays Captain de Merri
mac in a good, honest way, with never a
stage trick for effect, and sings his num
bers artistically with a well-trained voice
lof good range. There are hours when
I Mr. Persse bears . down all prejudice
j against his poor method by his convinc
ing performance, and as Valentine he has
I sounded one of those hours. Miss Ma
son's Olivette Is charming. Her crying
. song was as clever dramatically as musi
cally, and he who finds flaws in her voice
: distinct enough for criticism must be in
; a microscopic bad humor. Miss Riccl
walks out of her character straight to
1 the front of the stage and sings her first
solo for all the world like a concert
: singer. There is no sense in this and no
reason for it. so why Is it permitted? She
never seems to identify herself with her
part and as a result loses all sympathy.
Act 111 makes good the assurance that
"the last shall be first,'' for it far out- j
I strips the other two in effect, scenic and
musical. If it were not for the fact that
people disappear aboard ship behind a
piece of waving sky the illusion would be
complete. The dancing and ensemble
work call for willing approval and were
' greeted with ready applause. Next week
i we are to hear "Faust" in English, and j
i the management promises an elaborate I
j production.

have to come within fifteen or twenty

The Examiner, Mischief-Maker.
No doubt the President is greatly wor
ried over the demands of the Examiner
that he send a general to the Philippines.
In fact the attitude of this influential
journal probably worries him more than
all the other troubles of his administra
tion put together. Especially must this
be so of that brilliant editorial signed by
the great W. R. Hearst himself, and
which was such a remarkably able pro
duction that the Examiner printed It
twice in order that its full significance
might more forcibly strike its thousands
of readers. Warwick was a kingmaker,
Hanna is a president maker, but Willie
Hearst Is the general makerâ that is. gen
eral mischiefâ laker. He should swallow
some of his Internal policies himself, then
go to bed and have a good sweat. Prob

DEATH OF A PIONEER
WHOLESALE GROCER
THOMAS JENNINGS Passes Away at His
Country Seat Near Menlo Park.
ANOTHER of the men who helped to make the history of California
passed away early yesterday morning. Thomas Jennings, the capi
talist, died at his country reside- "Fair Oaks," Menlo Park, of
heart failure following an attack of grip and pneumonia.
Thomas Jennings came here via the Isthmus of Panama early ln
1852. At first he was tempted to go to the mines, but finally decided to settle
down In San Francisco. He joined the wholesale grocery firm of Fonda &
Gray and remained with them for years. Finally he decided to branch out
for himself, and in company with th c late George C. Ludington formed the
firm of Dudington & Jennings.
The rlew firm was a success from the start, and after the copartnership
had existed for years Mr. Ludington decided to go back Bast. Mr. Jennings
bought out his interest and up to about twelve years ago conducted the busi
ness alone. In 1887 Mr. Jennings was a wealthy man. so he decided to retire
from business. A. A. Hooper had beon in his employ for eighteen years and
was very highly thought of by the old gentleman, and as Mr. Jennings' son
George wanted to go Into business a partnership fas formed between Mr.
Hooper and the son, Mr. Jennings turning the whole of his grocery business
over to them. Since that time the firm name has been Hooper & Jennings.
In February last Mr. Jennings was laid up with an attack of the grip.
He got better slowly, and when the family thought he was all right again he
was lid up with a slight attack of pneumonia. AVhen ho rallied from that
he went down to Menlo Park, but his course was run and he passed away
at 5:30 a. m. yesterday from heart failure. The remains were brought up from
Menlo Park on a special train last night and taken to the family residence,
227 Fifteenth street.
Mr. Jennings leaves a widow and two sons and two daughters to mourn
his loss. The sons are George and Thomas Jr. and the daughters Mrs. Paul
F. Kingston and Miss Abigail Jennings. The deceased was 70 years old last
May, so he was only two months over the three score and ten limit.

WAR AMONG
ART SCHOOL
PROFESSORS
Class Division Is the
Cause.
Arthur Matthews, dean of the faculty
of the Hopkins School of Art, has returned
from Europe to quiet the many troubles
â¢which for some time past have beset the
Institution. During the absence of the
dean the school has suffered a serious de
crease in its profits and it is generally
known among- the^students that there has
been considerable friction between the art
professors and their pupils. The popular
ity of the dean is attested by the fact
that during his administration the school
had in average attendance of at least
103 students, whereas after he left for
Europe the average attendance was re
duced to about eighty. This decrease is
answerable for serious losses to the ex
chequer of the art school. Each pupil
attending the full day course pays $10 a
month. The half-day course costs $7 and
the night course $3 a month. From these
tuition fees the school calculates its
profits. â¢
When Dean Matthews left for Europe
several months ago John Stanton was
given charge of affairs. The temporary
change seemed to have he effect of en
gendering considerable friction between
the teachers. Each one was ambitious to
have the largest following of students,
and the rivalry became so acute that
man. discords arose. The trustees took
the matter in hand at last and to abolish
the causes of the inharmony altered the
course of study so as to let out one or
two teachers involved In the war of pop
ularity. This step was considered essen
tial to maintain the school's prestige and
increase Its profits. The earnings of the
institution for the year ended about the
time Mr. Matthews went away were $1000.
The loss thereafter caused by the de
crease of students has amounted to about
$600. ' -; . - â '.- .- â .-:.
According to the new arrangement de
cided upon by the trustees, Mr. Matthews
will continue as dean of the disturbed
faculty and the courses have been so
changed thai Harry Fonda, teacher of the
life class, lias been left without a func
tion. John Mai, resigns the manage
ment of tie school in favor of Mr. Mat
thews nd takes charge of the prepara
tory antique class. R. D. Yelland will
have the lass of sketching and perspec
tive. A night class will meet on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays of each week
under the direction of Charles Judson.
Miss Alice Chittenden will have the Sat
urday classes in antique and portrait
work; Douglass Tilden will have the
modeling class and the dean will continue
to teach the class of life and still life.
The school will reopen under these new
conditions on August 7.
Dean Matthews was seen yesterday rel
ative to the troubles which have con
cerned the school during his absence, lie
refused to enter into any. statement of
them, excepting to say that whatever
friction' there might have been would be
thoroughly dissipated by him when the
next school year commenced.
"I have heard In a general way," said
Mr. Matthews, "that differences have
arisen during my absence between teach
ers over the division of the students in
the various classes, and l believe that the
profits of the school have decreased. â¢â¢ I
intend to settle all these disputes among'
the faculty, and I think the new course
of study will help me in the work. My
only ambition is to see the school pro
gress and answer all the requirements of
a modern art school. I do not intend to
permit any friction to exist, and I sin
cerely hope that all the troubles of the
institution have been* settled. I take
pleasure In saying one thing about my
trip to Europe which shows that the work
of the Hopkins School is bearing satis
factory results. "While in Paris I met
many old pupils of the school who were
pursuing their studies there." .-â -';.= â¢;,; :-->.
A vigorous effort, will be made during
the next school year to Increase the earn
ings of tho institution by reclaiming those
students who discontinued their work as
a result of the internecine rows among
the teachers, and with the reopening it
is expected the warring factions In the
faculty will bury the hatchet and unite
in teaching the young Idea how to paint
to the exclusion of personal animosities
and ambitions.

hundreds of overcoats to keep
itself warm, but it might be well
to remind the paper that there
have been applications for sev
enty-two overcoats. After the
thirty of the Red Cross Society
and the princely eight it bun
koed out of General Warfield
there are still thirty-four _o be
supplied. The Examiner's haste
to supply these is strongly sug
gestive of the iceman.
One thousand strong the Oregon volun
teers held dress parade at the Presidio
last evening. They made as fine a body
of men as ever turned out at the post,
and being clothed in their khaki uni
forms they added a new feature to the
time-honored ceremony. Following the
dress parade was a review tendered to
Brigadier General Charles F. Beebe, com
manding the Oregon National Guard, who,
with three of his staff, had come down
from the north to see the regiment be
fore It would be mustered out of the serv
ice. *â¢
The dress parade was held at retreat.
At half-past 5 o'clock the bugles brought
the men into line in the company streets
and then the regiment "was marched over
to the infantry parade ground, where it
was formed in line of battalions, each
battalion being in close column of com
panies. The parade ground was almost
surrounded by the crowd which had
waited through the greater part of the
afternoon for the ceremony. It had been
announced that the regiment would par
ade some time after noon, and not to be
late, the people began coming from 1 '
o'clock on. They hung around the camp
until half-past 5. and then, following after I
the troops, they made their way over to ;
the parade ground.
There was nothing particular about the â 
ceremony except the appearance of the >
regiment, which could not well have been
improved upon, although Colonel Sum- j
mers said after it was over, "We will do !
it much better next time." A feature of
the parade was the manual of arms exe
cuted by the regiment. There was a
swing and a dasn to it which only ex
perience in the held can bring. The men
Handled their rifles as if they were used
to them and at every change of position
a thousand flashes of sunlight from as
many gun barrels told how nearly as one
the regiment moved. Retreat was sound- â 
ed by the regimental bugle corps,- and j
then the band commence- the ' "Star-
Spangled Banner." .As the first notes
were caught up- by the breeze the Hag j
fluttering at the truck of the tall start
near the guardhouse started slowly down, j
land the men in the crowd, civilians as
well as soldier on-lookers from the post, j
i bared their heads until the music ceased
I and .he nag had been lowered.
General Beebe, O. N. G. ; Major D. J.
Moore, brigade commissary, O. N. G.;
Major R. G. Jubitz, brigade inspector, O. j
N. G., and Captain W. B. Mackay, aid,
O. N. G., were upon the field and at tne
conclusion of the dress parade the gen
! eral and his staff officers took their places
I opposite the center of the regiment. The
order to pass in review was given and
the regiment swung down the parade
i ground and then turning came past the
' reviewing officers, company front, and )
walking with the full, free, easy tread j
of old campaigners. It was a beautiful j
sight. â¢ ,;
The review ended the regiment's duty,
and the companies were marched back to
camp again and' were disbanded at once.
Geneial Beebe expressed the greatest
plasure over the appearance of tne regi- !
ment. He said he was surprised to find tne
men so comfortable and the camp in such
I good condition. Many of the men he knew
personally; and he spent a good part of i
the day going around the tents seeing the i
old guardsmen who were coming nome j
veterans. :'tf-'-' 'tf.-tf '"â¢â¢'"
Just as the Oregon, regiment was com- !
ing Into line on the parade ground last |
evening and while recruits and regulars
made up a good half of the crowd that ;
blocked the roadway the fire call came
sharply from the guardhouse and inure j
was a rapid scamper of every beleggined j
and blue-coated spectator to his place in :
tire quarters. It turned out to be only a j
grass tire near the pumphouse, however, j
and the first few arrivals put it out with
out damage or loss of time. .Then all J
went back to criticize the parade.

surgeon of the department Private Bruce ;

SAN -FRANCISCO, July 21. 1599.
Committee of Native Sons and Daughters ln
Charge of Medal Fund for California Volun
teersâLadles and Gentlemen: Last week, much
'against our wishes, we were* obliged to decline
tc grant the use of the Pavilion to your com
. mittee for some date In August for a reception
to the returning California volunteers. It has
i since occurred to us that If your committee
I does not make any other arrangements we
; would be greatly pleased if we can arrange
i with you to have the distribution of the medals
! to our California volunteers take place at our
I fair. The fair runs from September 2 to Octo
i ber 7 next, and our idea would be to have a
i special night devoted to our soldier boys and
to make the distribution of the medals the
] great feature of the evening. The main aisle of
i the fair ls twenty-five feet wide and over 300
feet long, and the regiment could be drawn up
| along the aisle and after appropriate cere- j
: monies the medals could be presented.
We think that by the co-operation of your I
â  committee with us the matter could be ar
ranged ln a manner satisfactory and creditable â 
to all. . >â¢.â â-> â ::â¢;:..â >,
We would be pleased to have a conference
with a committee from your committee on this
matter at any time that can be convenlently
arranged. Yours very truly,
JOSEPH M. CUMMING, Secretary.
WANT SOLDIERS
TO GO HOME TO
MUSTER OUT
Sentiment of the La
bor Council.
â â¦ â
MAY CROWD LABOR MARKET
â â â¦ â
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO
TAKE ACTION.
â  â¦
It Is Believed That This Is to the
Best Interests of the Volunteers.
Regular Semi - Annual
Nominations Held.
. Under the head of "Good of the Order"
last night members of the San Francisco
Labor Council expressed their disapproval
of having returned volunteer soldiers
mustered out in San Francisco. The chief
reasons given were that the men would
be paid off in this city, would spend their
money here and then, finding themselves
stranded, would either be dependent upon
the charity of the community, driven to
starvation and thence back into the
ranks, or forced into the ranks of labor,
where necessity would cause them to take
work at any wages offered.
The ball was set rolling by Andrew Fu
ruseth of the Sailors' Union. He said:
"The Oregon regiment has elected to be
mustered out here and this brings us face
to face with a serious question, If the
men from Oregon have chosen to say
farewell to army life in this city, the
chances are that other soldiers will fol
low their course. it is a long distance
from the Pacific Coast to the Mississippi
River. When the men who have been
suffering privation In the Philippine Isl
ands for months receive money in a civil
ized city, their first impulse will be to
spend It. ln the course of a few weeks
the majority of them will be penniless
an.l San Francisco, which has profited
for a season from the soldiers, will find
Itself called upon to support them. Ihe
railroad is chary of giving transportation,
Darticularly East. What, then, will be
come of these men? All trades are rep
resented among them, and they are men
who will work for anything rather than
starve or beg. This is a serious question.
We cannot have the ranks of labor aug
mented by starving and penniless men,
and it is our duty to see that proper steps
are taken toward having them mustered
out in their home towns.''
Other members of the council spoke
along the same lines. Secretary Rosen
berg claimed that the whole thing was a
scheme to force the discharged and pen
niless soldiers back into the army in or
der that there would be no difficulty in
organizing a sufficient force to carry on
an apparently endless war in the Philip
pines " He said that both the administra
tion and officers of the army were conniv
ing to this end and that the men were be
ing prompted to choose San Francisco as
th.- mustering out place by their superi
ors The whole matter was finally placed
in the hands of the executive committee,
and the suggestion was made that a cir
cular be addressed to the Governors of
the various States requesting them to lay
the whole matter before their respective
troops and urge the men to come, noma
L. be mustered out.
Nominations for the regular semi-an
nual election of officers to be held next
week resulted as follows: For presidentâ

SHOOTING IS
EXCELLENT IN
MANY COUNTIES
GOOD RETURNS REPORTED
Both Deer and Dove; Are Plenti
ful, Being Scattered All
Over the Country.
The sportsmen who have gone In quest
of deer and doves have returned delighted
with the sport they enjoyed at the onen-
Ir.g of the season. Deer have been killed
within a short distance of this city, while
doves are. from appearances, scattered
all over the State. '..v. are still nest
ing In the fruit orchards and grain fields.
A we'd known gunman is authority for
the statement that there should be no
shooting until the middle of August, thus
giving the young birds a chance to de
velop
Conditions differ in various parts of the
State, the birds maturing early in some
places. For this reason it would be diffi I
cult to frame a law giving the desired
relief. The gardeners up the river are
charged with being the most inveterate
violators of the game laws. They are
accused of shooting doves, quail and
ducks whenever the opportunity 'presents
itself.
W. F. Roed< of this city is In the Santa
Cruz Mountains with a party of friends
and is enjoying exciting sport. In a let
ter to a friend he says:
We are at Camp . -cnt in the moun
tains, six miles back of star-gents Station.
The weather has been windy and foggy
early in the morning, tin the 15th, the first
day out, we had excellent sport, securing
two deer. On the 16th, we killed another.
To-day (Monday) we are taking matters
easy ln camp, as we all feel tlie effects uf
our work iti the field. We have a number
of good shots in our party and have a
pack of twenty dogs in all.
As usual, there are several funmakers in
the camp, who are always jobbing some
lie. They make matters Nolan. with
â¢actieal jokes. The party includes:

Patch, In recognition of his experience
in rowing and his readiness to take new j
crews and single scullers in hand and
give them the benefit of ids knowledge, -
"VV. O. Patch has probably devoted more
attention to the theory of rowing than
any of the local oarsmen, having read
with care the book on rowing and sculling
written by "A*. B. VVoodgate of Brasenose j
College, Oxford, who was a well known |
Oxford University oarsman, and won the :
diamond and Wingneld sculls at Henley ,
regatta on several occasions.
T. J. Sullivan, the new captain of the I
Dolphins, has been a member of the club
for several years, and has filled the offlce j
of president. He is enthusiastic and has :
promised to get together a junior barge
crew for the championship races. The
most likely candidates for places in the
crew an F. \V. Woernner. Frank Mc-
Elrath. Harry Herbert, T. J. Kennedy,
Dr. Bacigalupi and E. Convey. Harry
Herbert, a good swimmer and fond of
rowing, was elected to membership.
The much-talked-of Ladies' day will be
held on the 30th Inst, and great efforts
will be made to render it successful. One
of the principal events will be the second

LONDON, July 21.â The calm preced
ing a battle marked the eve of the in
ternational varsity struggle, both the
London and Brighton teams resting to- ;
day and saving their strength for to
morrow's contests. No competitors ap- i
â¢ eared at the Queen's Club, where a j
score of women were engaged in fitting

possible form and the .team is in even
better condition than when its mem

th.- change of climate, if it has had any
effect at all. has only put the young
athletes in Lett, spirits. Not a man
missed a meal aboard ship or since
they have been in England. Their
training has been very light during
the week. Mr. Wendell's Idea being
merely to keep the men in form after
they had arrived at their best. Mr.
Wendell preserves admirable discipline
without making it irksome, and he is
very popular among his young charges.
The Englishmen and Americans are
fairly evenly matched in the 100-yard
and hurdle races and also in the 440

Fisher are confident of winning this
match.

AGAINST KING SWEENEY
Declare That Ills Potent Pull Was
Used in Stopping Their Graft
Failing to (let His Share of a Recent Robbery, They
Claim He induced the Police to Have Warrants
issued for the Arrest of the Gang.
THF numerous grafters and bunko
men who allied themselves with
John Sweeney on account of his
alleged "pull" with the police are
now up in arms against the man,
who boasts that he has one or more de
tectives on his stuff and that he Is In a
position to square any case of a bucolic
stranger being "skinried" by the schem
ing gang. Sweeney ostensibly is known
as the proprietor of a lodging-house south
of Market street, but in reality is the
"go between" for the horde of sure-thing
operators that infest this city-.
The trouble that exists between the j
modern Fagin and tho adept pupils dates i
back to about a week ago. Sweeney
learned that two of the gang who had ;
worked under his protecting wing neglect
ed to account to him for a "trick" they ,
had turned. He made a quiet investiga
tion; with the result thai he was stag- |
gered to llnd that they had the audacity!
to "beat" a "sucker" out of several hun-j
dred dollars without having given him j
a percentage of the spoils. Determined;
to teach them a lesson, the mighty
Sweeney summoned them before him and
Jn language mere forceful than elegant
informed them that they could no longer j
"work" in this city.
**You have played me fiu'se." remarked
the "king," with considerable dramatic ef- j
feet. "Hereafter cut me out of the deck |
that you use in beating suckers."
Failing to â¢â¢square" themselves, the ex- I
pelled subjects slowly left - *his Majesty" j
to ruminate o-ver their fatal blunder in
not "'piecing*" the man who boasts that
he controls the Police Department.
The disgraced grafters subsequently,
fearing that Sweeney intended to have
them thrown in jail, decided to inform \
t";eir companions in crime of the edict of I
the "king."
After a formal discussion, they resolved
to defy him even at the risk of being sent
to prison.
On learning thai his "subjects" were
determined to dethrone him, Sweeney j
became desperate and swore to get even.
The following day warrants were sworn
out for six ot the gang for vagrancy and
they were promptly arrested. Detective
Egan figured as the complaining witness
in each case. â¢
Since then teen other warrants for
the arrest of the remaining **subjects"
have been issued, but for some reason
they have not been served. It is claimed
that Sweeney, anxious to whip the dis
gruntled gang of grafters into line, has
asked the police not to arrest them at
present, as he seems to think that they
will shortly regret their action and beg
to be taken back to his fold.
Evidently realizing that he is suspected
of being responsible for the issuance of
the warrants Sweeney has discreetly kept
out of the way of the revengeful gang.
Several nights ago two of them visited
his lodging house, intending to wreak vio
lence on him. They were told that he
was out of town, but suspecting that
they were being misled they waited out
side for several hours, but without catch
ing a glimpse of their intended victim.
Some time ago Sweeney, so it Is claimed,
gave the gang the "double cross" and
they started out to get his scalp.
One of them telephoned to him. saying
that Detective Egan wanted to see him
at midnight In front of a Market street
saloon. Â£>v.eeney lost no time in reaching
the supposed trysting place and as tie
entered the saloon he was attacked by
SECRETARY CUMMING
IS AGING PREMATURELY
WANTS TO KNOW "WHY IS A
GIRL WHEN SHE SPINS?"
Troubles and Worries Encountered by
Manager of the Mechanics' In
stitute in Getting a Maiden
to Card WooL
A spinster to s*_in flax or wool was what !
the Mechanics'. Institute wanted as a I
feature for the coming fair, and the spin- j
sters came ln numbers, not large but :
talkativeâ so talkative!
"And still they come," said Secretary
J. M. Gumming of the institute, after the j
third applicant for the post had talked to j
him. He was still debonair and gay, but !
the Secretary Cumming who left the office '
late ln the day. after talking to ten or a
dozen applicants, was not the blithe and ;
happy Cumming of the morning. Instead. â 
he was worn and bore marks of age and
his gold-bowed spectacles sat uneasily on |
his nose.
Mr. Gumming can speak German and !
Gaelic, also Spanish, but he is not a mas- â¢
ter of Swedish, Danish, Erse, Breton and
Polish, So he had a hard day of it, for
the only American who applied up to a j
late hour was a lady from Pike County,
Mo and her dialect was neat but not so
clear as Mr. Gumming is accustomed to i
'â¢Can you spin?" he asked the first ap- j
"Sure and I learned to spin in the ould ;
country," said she. _"â 'â â -;â -'"'-â â¢ Â.,
â¢'But do you know how to card wool?
"Indeed and I don't." said the applicant. i
â â¢Card wool? Why, we lave that to the;
chiider. and I'll not But I can spin from
the roll." , â_,, , . ~
"And how to get the roll?" asked Cum-
m "Sure and that's your business," said
"Sure and that's your business, said
the lady, and she left her name and ad
dress and flounced out-
Some of he ladies knew how to card the
wool and arrange it Into rolls of spinning,
but they were few, and of the few only
two knew how to spin flax as well as
woolâ a necessary condition in order to
obtain the place. But in the various dia- ;
lects that they let loose on Cumming to
explain what they could and what they
could not do they wore him out. So, ex
cept to explain the process, it would be
unfortunate to talk about the art of spin
ning to the secretary of the Mechanics'
Instil for some time to come.
"If any one applies," said he to Miss
Ahem, the typewritist of the institute,
"you just see" what she wants and take
the application." And then he went away-. {

Excellent Work Performed by the
Animal Society's Officers.
Three days ago the Society for the Pre
vent!' of Cruelty to Animals held Its an
nual election of trustees, and Thursday
the latter organized, with N. P. Cole as
president. Colonel John P. Jackson as vice
president, JaitiM S. Hutchinson as treas
urer, Charles B. Holbrook as secretary
and Martin Stevens as attorney for -the
board. Dr. Ivor Jacobsen, Dr. C. Maso
i: o and Dr. Egan -were elected a? the
veterinary surgeons for the society. Four
of the old members, J. B. Godeau, H. G.
Stindt. A. H. Stevenson and E. C. Cordell,
were appointed as special officers. Eleven
new members were elected.
The secretary's report for the month
ending July 19 showed 225 cases of cruelty
reported, involving 42.8 animals, and 223
cases were investigated. This resulted in
22 prosecutions, with 12 convict
The total of the fines imposed by the
Police Judges amounted to $170. During
the month the secretary collected $1722, of
which $S7l 10 was disbursed. leaving a bal
ance of S&SO 90. The trustees heartily in
dorsed the proposition of the lady mem

head with "black jacks."
Sweeney drew his revolver,' which was

not been for a policeman who happened
to see the men assaulting Sweeney and
rushed to His* rescue he might have been
made a subject for the Coroner. As it was
he was severely cut about the head and
face.
In speaking nf Sweeney's alleged pull
with the Police Department one of the
gang said yesterday:
"Whenever a strange bunko man
reaches this city.'* he marked, "he is
told to see Sweeney; otherwise he runs
afoul of a policeman and is arrested. I
have seen dozens of professional grafters
on their arrivel here immediately hunt up

them to rob gullible strangers. Sweeney
exacts 20 per cent of th-Mr ill-gotten gains,

Pushing the Corkscrew Line.
The Market Street Railroad Company
is pushing the construction of the cork
screw line by setting pangs of men to
work on both ends of the turn. The San
some street section Is almost laid, and
yesterday a gang of men started in at
Sixth and Market streets tearing up the
old rails and making the course clear for
the tracklayers to commence digging the
ditch for the bed of the electric line. The
presence of the men at this end of the
road had the effect of scaring off the
ghost bobtail cars that have been bobbing
up and down on Sixth street for the past
twenty years. With the Introduction of
the electric cars on the corkscrew line the
bobtail cars will be relegated to the wood

U. S. TRANSPORT INDIANA, DIRECT FROM MANILA.
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 22, 1899.
SICK SOLDIERS
HOME FROM THE
PHILIPPINE WAR
Transport Indiana In
From Manila,
Â» â
A SOLDIER COMMITS SUICIDE
â â¦ â
WHILE INSANE. ED CRAWFORD
JUMPED OVERBOARD.
Â«
How Sergeant Jones of the Tennessee
. Regiment Captured a Filipino
Flag â Motley Crew on
the Indiana.
The transport Indiana arrived from
Manila via Nagasaki yesterday. She
brought up 125 sick and convalescent sol
diers, twenty-two cabin passengers, fif
teen Filipino ' men, women and children
for the Omaha Exposition and six stow
aways. Tho transport has been nine
months on duty In the Philippines and
in consequence brings back as motley a
crew as has ever reached port. She has
twenty-six Filipinos In the engine-room,
twenty-six Filipino cabin boys, twenty
one Filipino sailors, a Boer fireman, a
French boatswain, some Japanese and
Chinese mess boys, a couple of Arab
deckhands and a sprinkling of all the
Caucasian nationalities. They all seem
to have worked well, for the ship came
into port looking as spick and span as
though she had just come out of the dry
dock.
There was one fatality during the voy
age. Edward Crawford of Company A.
Twenty-third Infantry, jumped overboard
when the Indiana was 250 miles froth port
and was drowned. He was a California
boy, and his sister, Mrs. Alfred Terry,
lives at 10-W Mission street, and another
sister, Mrs. James Glassford, at 28 Grove
Street.
Crawford was under the delusion that
he had been hypnotized and was going
to San Francisco under compulsion to be
killed. He made several attempts to kill
himself, and when the Indiana left M i.
nila Sergeant Kay of the Twenty-third
infant:*.- was detailed to watch him.
While the transport was in Nagasaki,
Kay and Crawford were standing on the
starboard side of the ship watching the
town. Somebody called the sergeant
away, and when he came back Crawford
was gone. The vessel was searched from
stem to stern, but no trace of the miss
ing man could be found. Divers were
sent down and the bottom in the vicinity
of the ship searched in all directions with
out avail.
Just before the Indiana sailed for this
port it was rumored that Crawford had
been seen in the streets of Nagasaki, bo
Sergeant Kay was sent out to look for
him A few minutes before the anchor
was pulled up Crawford came alongside
in a sam pan and Immediately began tell
ing of the splendid time he had had in :
Nagasaki. It was then sailing time and
as there was no sign of Sergeant Kay
the ship went without him. He will prob
ably come along on the next transport
that touches at Nagasaki.
Upon leaving Nagasaki Crawford was
given ln charge of Private Mike O'Brien
and ho Kept a vigilant watch over the
unfortunate man. Last Thursday it was
very rough and O'Brien and Crawford
were the only men aside from the craw
on the deck. They were marching up and
down when all of a sudden Crawford
said, "I'm not going back to be killed," .
and making a rush to the rail Jumped
overboard. The ship was stopped, life '
buoys were thrown overboard and a boat
lowered, but no trace of poor Crawford |
could be found. He was very much -ema
ciated from his long illness and the water
was exceedingly cold, so the chances are '
the Shock killed him. After searching for
th body for nearly an hour the Indiana I
was put on her course and came on to ,
San Francisco.
The Filipinos for the Omaha Exposition
are in charge of Henry F. Daily. They
are said to be a fair sample of the inhab
itants of the Philippines. They are not
beautiful. They have a band of native
instruments and render some pieces very
prettily. All their music Is played by
ear. Their star piece they call "Dakota,"
because they learned it from the Dakota
regiment. Mr. Daily is keeping a very ;
close watch on his charges and says he
will see to it that they are landed in
Omaha safe and sound. This band is
only the advance guard of sixty-five
men. women and children who will event
ually gather here at the Mechanics' Fair.
They will bring the water buffalo and
everything necessary to make up a typi- I
cal Filipino village.
Among the Filipino waiters on the In
diana are two graduates of the Manila
University. One of them, Melancio Alba,
is a very intelligent young fellow and is
going to make his home in America if
the Government will give him a chance.
Among those who returned on the Indi
ana was Dr. Day-wall of San Francisco.
According to him a Filipino wounded in
battle is Insensible to pain. One man
had his eye torn out by a bullet and his
Jaw shattered. When the wound was
dressed he tore the bandages off, and two
or three days later was breaking in a
horse as though there was no gaping
wound in his head. Another Filipino at
tempted to escape and was filled full of
Krag-Jorgensen bullets. When he was
picked tip eighteen wounds were found on
his body and his right arm was shattered.
Three days later he was sitting up In bed
and eating "chow," on the rapid meal.
Still another Filipino was wounded in a
skirmish and lay for sevt-n days in a rice
fleld with,. water. He was carried to
the hospital tent and when the -Indiana
sailed was awaiting a chance to get back
into the insurgent lines.
The most daredevil act of the war was
performed by Sergeant Jones of the Ten
nessee regiment; The latter were opposed
to the Filipinos in force, who were In
trenched. Over the trenches flew a Fili
pino flag-.
SCENES ON BOARD THE TRANSPORT INDIANA.
"Boys, I am going to get that flag, '
said Jones, and off he started.
Jones is a big man, standing over six
feet in his stockings, and he looked taller
even than that when he started out alone
over the "poddy" field for the Filipino
trenches. The enemy were too inucn sur
prised at first at the man's daring to fire
upon him, but they soon opened up and a
perfect hall of lead flew around the gal
lant soldier. When the fire became too
hot ho would lie down for a few seconds
and pick off a venturesome Filipino and
then resume his march toward â¢ the
trenches. When he reached them the ene
my around the flag broke and ran. Jones
then seized it and bore it back in tri
umph to the Tennessee camp. That Fil
ipino flag is now one of the treasures of
tne Tennessee regiment.
A bandit named Papa Rlas Is giving tho
'soldiers at Iloilo a great deal of trouble.
He scours the country and murders all
who will not assist him. Six native police
men were sent to confer with him. Five of
them were brutally murdered and one
returned more dead than alive to tell the
tale. The California boys made a forced
march of twenty-five miles, hoping to
capture the bandit, but he escaped and
was still carrying on his depredations
when the Indiana sailed.
The remains of Major Diggles of the
Minnesota regiment came up on the
transport. He was shot through the head
at the battle of Massln.

and civilians who came up on the Indiana:

A STRANGE CORPSE IN
THE DECKELMAN PLOT
Body of a Filipino in the Place of a
California Volunteer.
Parents of a Young San Franciscan Pay It the Last
Tribute, Thinking It Was That of Their
Soldier Son.
A casket supposed to contain the re
mains of Private Francis Deckelman.
Company L, First California Volunteers,
was lowered in May last into a grave in
the Deckelman family plat at Odd Fel-
lows' Cemetery. On the 11th of the pres
ent month, on the suspicion that a mis
take had been made, the casket was dis
interred at the request of the boy's father,
and the suspicion verified. Another
corpse, he believes, than that of his son
met the eyes of the elder Deckelman.
Decomposition had set in to such an ex
tent that identification was impossible,
but it was plain to the bereaved father
that a dead Filipino had been given the
resting place intended for his son.
Young Deckelman was the son of Mr.
and Mrs. F. Deckelman of 505 Lyon
street, his father being a member of the
firm of Wessels & Deckelman, 239 Cali
fornia street. He was just 22 years old
when he enlisted as a private in Company
L, First California. He sailed with his
regiment to the Philippines, landing at
Cavite July 2, IS9S. When the regiment
moved to Camp Dewey Deckelman, who
had been detailed from his company for
duty with the Medical Corps, remained
behind. He died in the hospital August
28 following and his body was buried in
the San Rogue Cemetery-
Early this year the Government sent
from this city S. Reinhard, who was com
missioned to disinter the soldier dead and
prepare them for shipment to this coun
try*. Eight days after Reinhard reached
Cavite the Aguinaldo rebellion broke out
and the plan of disinterment had to be
abandoned for the time. It was not at
tempted till April, the rebel army mean
while having overrun the San Rogue
Cemetery. When the insurgent bands
were driven back, however, Reinhard be
gan the work for which he had been em
ployed. He entered the cemetery with a
number of assistants and found that all
the headboards marking the graves had
been destroyed by the Filipinos.
In ordinary cases this absence of head
boards would have made difficult the iden
tification of the dead. Such a contin
gency, however, had been provided for. it
having been the custom to place on the
top of each coffin before the earth was
thrown on a sealed bottle containing a
slip of paper upon which was written the
name of the corpse. - ...
Reinhard says that in addition to finding
this bottle on the coffin in a grave offi
cially designated as Djckelmans, the
grave was identified by members of Com
pany L who had seen the boy buried. He
had the coffin hauled up, took out the
remains, which had decomposed beyond
AN OFFICE ABOLISHED
BY THE LEGISLATURE
THE COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC
WORKS CEASES TO EXIST.
Supreme Court Passes on the Test
Case Against Col_*an Presented
by Edward E. Leake.
The Supreme Court yesterday denied the
application of Edward E. Leake, Commis
sioner of Public Works, for a writ of man
date to compel Controller E. P. Colgan to
draw a warrant for the salary of the
Commissioner for the month of last
March. The Controller had refused on
the ground that the office had gone out
of existence by an act of the last Legis
lature. On account of the large amount
of public Improvements in hand and con
templated the Commissioner took the case
to the highest court for a decision. In
denying the petition the court said: tf.'.
"In 1593 the Legislature created the of
flce of Commissioner of Public Works, de
fining Its duties and powers and fixing the
salary, and made an appropriation to

I recognition In the swampy cemetery, and,
resealing them in a zinc covering soldered
i airtight, placed the body in a box and
j sent it with twenty-two others to the
I transport City of Puebla.
The Puebla arrived at San Francisco in
' the latter part of May last, and the box
, containing the hermetically sealed re
mains supposed to be those of young
I Deckelman was turned over to the under
| taker designated by his parents. It was
i decided that it would be best not to open
; the zinc case, and the body was lowered
1 Into the grave, the Deckelmans having
j paid religious tributes to the memory of
! their son without a farewell look at his
i face.
The suspicions of the elder Deckelman
I were not aroused till several days later,
j when he recalled the fact that the casket
did not seem to be heavy enough to con
tain the remains of his son. He commu
nicated this belief to Reinhard. who told
him that this was probably due to the
1 rapidity of decomposition, the remains
i being little more than a skeleton. Later
; on, Reinhard says, he was told by Deckel
i man that his son had been buried at
j Paranaque, and not at San Rogue. A re
i turned soldier, he said, had so told him.
Reinhard explained how -mistakes had
j been guarded against and the elder Deck
elman appeared to be satisfied. He was
not. however, for on the 11th of this
j month he got a permit from the Board
of Health to disinter the body. In com-
I pany with an undertaker, he went to the
j family plat and saw the casket raised and
; the zinc casing cut open. The remains
were practically in the same condition as
i described by Reinhard, little more than
j bones. The flesh was nearly all gone, so
I that not a single distinct feature re
j mained. On top of the skull, however,
! there was still a good sized patch of hair.
enough for the father to satisfy himself
I that it was not the hair of his son.
The hair of young Deckelman was light
I brown and very soft. The hair on the
I skull of the disinterred body was black
I and coarse. The father was overcome at
the discovery. It was a losing again of
the son he had mourned. He knew not
what to do, nor where to go to find the
body of his boy. He was haunted, too,
by the idea that by some strange chemi
cal charge in the swamps of San Rogue
the brown locks of his boy had become
; transformed into the black shock he saw
before him. He was at his wits' end and
I knew not which way to turn, resolving
: finally to have the remains relnterred.
The zinc covering was soldered up, the
: body was lowered and the grave filled in.
I There the remains are to-day, but
I whether or not they are those of his son
! or of a dead Filipino, the father of Fran-
I ciÂ« Deckelman is at a loss to say.
Reinhard, who disinterred the body at
i San Rogue. says that there is no mis-
I take; the body is that of young Deckel
i man without a doubt.
contended, however, that the subject mat
ter of this section Is not embraced within
the title of the act and that it is there
fore vcid under article IV, section 24, of
the constitution, which declares that an
act shall embrace but one subject, which
subject shall be expressed in its title,
and that it shall be void as to matters not
so expressed. But the fixing of the term
or tenure of office under an act such as
this or the abolition of the offlce are all
matters embraced within or germane to
the subject of the original act, and they
may find an expression in an amendatory
act without specific mention of them in
the title of such amendatory act. Such
is the well settled rule based upon very
obvious considerations. Reference need
only be made to Cooley's Constitutional
Limitations, sixth edition, page 174. para

By this last mentioned act an auditing
board for the Commissioner of Public
Works is created; but the amendatory act
continued the offlce in existence for about
two years, and there is nothing in the
latter act for the conclusion that the
Legislature meant to do other than to reg

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, July 21.â The stock market was
flu to-day for the whole list, but the tone ;
â¢was firm "and prices were higher than those
of la?' night. The Grangers were especially in : ,
good demand and ruled for the greater part of j ;
the day at about a point above yesterday. Bur
llngton and Rock Island showed special ,
strength and there was some evidence of man
lpulation In these two stocks. Much talk was
heard of Burlington's large earnings for June
and rumors were afloat of a coming Increase
In Rock Island dividend rate, which was.
however without official sanction. London j
â was a decided factor in the day's higher prices
and buying for thai account in New lorK
was estimated as high as 20,000 shares prin
cipally of Louisville md Nashville. Money
conditions were apparently much easier In
London and the sterling exchange rate here
-worked lower In sympathy in spite of the
lower tendency of the local money rates. All
apprehension of shipments of gold to-morrow
was dissipated early in the day with a bene- '
ficial effect on speculative sentiment. The
Influences from abroad â 'â ' : " all favorable ex
cept a fall In French rentes and a decline
In the sterling exchange rate at Paris, which
suggested increased money need at that cen- j
ter Considerering the dullness of the mar

broad a large number of usually Inactive |
stocks coming Into activity and registering I
sharp gains Among these were Colorado and ,
Southern first preferred. Colorado Fuel, the :
Smelting Stocks, Lead and Pacific Mail. Not :
all 0 { these gains were held, the market drop
ping away somewhat in the intense dullness
,; the late trading. The local traction stocks
were all in pretty good demand, Brooklyn
Transit rising an extreme l"4c and closing up ;
l%c. Sugar was inclined to be heavy through
out the day on rumors of new developments
in the opposition. Some hesitation was caused
in the late dealings by doubts as to the char- j
acter of to-morrow's bank statement, changes ,
in the cash item being problematical. Prices
were marked up li some cases just before the
close, giving a steady tone to the final trans-;
actions. .",_'.

higher. Total sales, par value, $1,600,000.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
I NEW YORK. July 21.- Bradstreet's Financial
I Review will say to-morrow:
Exceedingly narrow conditions have prevail- !
ied this week in the securities market. The j
i customary suspension of its activity at this '
! period of the year has been aggravated by the I
j continued firmness of money, by the uncer- I
j tainty of the financial position and of specu- j
! lation In the foreign markets and by the in- j
; creased symptom of stringency and nothing to j
j enforce liquidation of holdings of stocks. The .
fad that crop prospects at the West are ex- |
: tremely favorable, the outlook for a phenome- '
: nal yield of corn in particular being very j
' bright, has also checked bearish activity and j
I caused some purchasing of the granger stocks, {
I based on the idea thai largely increased earn
; ings are assured in properties. Current rail- I
j road earnings are, Indeed, very satisfactory, |
; and the industrial business situation ln the I
I whole gives confidence to Wall street as to the |
; future of the stock market, modified somewhat j
by the Idea that such a state of affairs will ;
lead to an augmented demand, for money and j
! Ifuth divert capital from speculation and in- i
, duce a higher range of interest rates.
The example of the London money market,
! where the somewhat stringent conditions that
; have lately prevailed, are attributed to the ac
i tivity of trade throughout Great Britain and
1 the consequent demand for mercantile accom- |
I modations, have not escaped the attention of
i the market and furnish the basis for compar
'â  isons between the position at London and what i
jis possible here. During the earlier da . of
; the week the stringency of money at London
and the firmness of exchange rates here
i caused apprehension that the recent outflow of
gold would be renewed, but such fears were
not realized, and the appearance of an easier
tone in the principal foreign money market,
with the absence of the expected advance in
the Bank of England's rate of discount on j
Thursday, was accounted as a favorable fac- :
tor.
The strike on the Brooklyn Transit system
and the similar disturbances on some of the j
I Metropolitan Street Railway lines in Manhat- '
; tan borough had less effect than might have
I been anticipated, though the stocks of both i
i corporations were depressed and the incident,
j particularly in the early portion of the week, j
; created additional caution in professional cir
cles. 1' is, however, one of the maxims of I
Wall street that bear movements based on
labor troubles are seldom if ever profitable to .
short sellers of the stocks affected. For this \
reason and because of 'he support extended to
the traction stocks they did not yield mate
rially and in fact showed some* response to the
latter developments, tending to show the weak
ness of the strike. There were no new deals "â¢
j in the railroad world, though suggestions .of
coming developments of thai kind continue to

BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, July" 21.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: The general trade situation has
apparently lost nothing in strength. The ag
gregate of midsummer business is of an un
precedented volume and signs of expansion ln
the demand for fall and winter goods Increase.
Prices, except for the cereals', coffee; raw su
gar and dairy products, are either firmly held
or tend upward. Notable among the products
advancing are pork products, petroleum, copper,
tin, tin plate and raw wool, while the list of
products unchanged includes refined sugar,
hides, leather, lead and cotton. Crop prospect
are encouraging, the movement of grain to
market is of Immense volume and railroad
earnings consequently continue to show large
increases over preceding years.
- Possibilities that the present corn crop will
equal if not exceed the largest on record have
.depressed prices of this cereal to an extent
equal to the decrease In wheat. The corn yield
in Kansas, particularly, promises to be enor
mous, always providing that hot winds do not
affect the crop.
Iron and steel retain all of their old strength
and while prices at the East are unchanged

material are noted at Chicago. Inquiry by
Bradstreet's shows that the scarcity of sup
plies in this industry has exercised some in
fluence upon industrial operations. Several
mills at the West are reported idle because of
lack of material. Structural forms of Iron
and steel are also backward in delivery and
some new work has been discouraged by fears
that supplies of material will not be forth-
C "textile circles the situation is one of __
In textile circles the situation is one of un
abated strength, but particularly i: Â« .00l i and
woolen goods. Manufacturers are freer buyers
at the East and their agents are purchasing
heavily at the West. Quotations for fine grades
are consequently higher all around, in tne
market for finished goods orders are of la-ge
volume, particularly in worsteds, .and some con
cerns are cutting down consumers orders,
claiming inability to deliver.
The Jobbing demand for dry goods is in
creasing slowly at the East and the prospects
are regarded as highly encouraging.
Advices from the boot and shoe trade s are
generally satisfactory and little difficulty Is .
experienced in obtaining the advanced quota
tions demanded. An example of earlier activity
in this line is furnished by the report that
Boston shipments for the first half of this year

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, July 21.â R. G. Dun & Co's
weekly review of trade will say:
Optimism is always popular, but more than
half the time dangerous. Several years of
halting and reaction historically follow three
of rapid progress. But the three of progress
have not yet passed and the cautious search
discloses no sign of halting. Foreign anxie
ties have been real, but they seem to be pass- I
Ing and Europe has begun paying liberally
for more food without expectation that secur- ;
ities can be sent in settlement. The expensive ;
labor strikes have vanished and the local ;
troubles do not affect national business. Fears j
of new and powerful corporations lessen as It
is found that they are controlled by the same
laws which govern the small companies.
Above all. the general evidences of prosper- |
ity continue convincing, failures are the small
est ever known for the season, railroad earn- j
ings the largest and solvent payments through I
clearing houses in July have been 48.6^ per
cent larger than last year and 62.3 larger than
in 1892. the best previous years.
The official returns of the most wonderful
year in the nation's commerce show a de- \
! crease of Jb5.900.000 in value of the great staples
IFeai-^of deficient crops has been buried un- j
der Western receipts from farms amounting
I to 13 661 046 bushels of wheat for the month
! thus far, against 3,773,108 last year, and 15,298,
--! 655 bushels of corn, against 6.612.31., last year.
Exports.* of wheat, Atlantic and Pacific, have i
i been 7 709 193 bushels during the month thus
' far, against 7,399,259 last year, and of corn |
9.093.041 bushels, igainsi 5,087,857 last . year.
Prices declined sharply with assurance of |
! ample suppliesâ wheat 3 cents and corn -*-
â  centsâ which is the more significant in view
|of the previous heavy exports of both. Cot
| ton also is gaining abroad largely, though lie
i price remains $6 19. . , , , __ I
Pig ron has not advanced this week, but
1 advances have occurred in finished products,
j steel rails to $30 at Pittsburg, billets to $34.
' sheet bars to (3550, sheets to 3 cents at Pitts-
I burg, and cut and wire nails both $3 per ton.
The American Tin Plate Company -settled
with Its men by granting 15 per cent more
! wages and raised the price of plates 50 cents
per box. Still demand does not abate, though ]
works have to refuse many orders. In plates
! one large order for shipment to the Clyde was
I received. In bars less urgency of demand ap-
I pears In the East, but in sheets works are
about filled for the year, and in structural
shapes, besides 3500 tons for bridges and 1200
for buildings at Chicago, a proposal is re-.
ported for 000 tons to build a palace for the
Mikado of Japan.
Coke Is unchanged in price and likely to !
break the record for production this month.
Tin Is lifted to (28 90 by wild speculation; cop
; per is firm at 18*Â£ cents, and lead is said to be ]
sold by the smelting companies below $4 60,
the quoted price.
Wool is still advancing, Coates Brothers' cir- ;
I cular of the 15th showing a rise of 2.19 cents
since May 15, speculation being particularly
actlve in fine wool because It Is rising abroad,
though in less demand for manufacture here
I than combing and medium grades. At the
i three markets 35.956,500 pounds have been sold
| In three weeks, against 34.124,700 pounds in the
I same weeks of 1897, before the present tariff
! was enacted.
j Manufacturers do not appear to be buying
largely, though the demand is better and has I
caused an advance in textiles and some other
kinds. Cotton goods are unchanged but fairly
' -adv.
Leather is in good demand and slightly :
higher and hides at Chicago rise slightly with;
i limited receipts.
Failures for the week have been 140 In the
j United States, against 207 last year, and 23 in'
j Canada, against 17 last year.

news was bearish. There were no shippers in
market, and the bears depressed prices on
heavy Argentine shipments of 1,350.000 bushels.
Northwest temperatures were more favorable,
but South Dakota temperatures were less so.
The bulls turned sellers. ,
Later on the market hardened on a %d ad
vance at Liverpool and wires from Tacoma that

western markets were stronger.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been three arrivals of coal from
British Columbia with 10.343 tons; four from
Washington, 8206 tons; two from Coos Bay,
710 tons; two from Australia, 5706 tons; total,
24,964 tons. Coal tonnage Is becoming so scarce
for the coast transportation that it is with dif
ficulty sufficient can be had for our immediate
requirements. Freights have been marked up,
and owners' demands are readily acceded to. ,
Several new steamers will become local col- .
liers this year, but they are not yet available. |
Business locally In the fuel line shows no
change; prices are stationary and demand fair.
The Honolulu coal demand has not abated: yes
terday a charter for there from Australia was
eloped at 17s 6d per ton, August. 1900, cancella
tion, more than a year hence. Such an occur
rence has never happened before in the history |
of the trade, and demonstrates that later on a :
partial coal famine may be looked for in Ha- I
wall or higher prices will rule there. |
"The extreme rates paid for Honolulu will
divert coal carriers in Australia from seeking
this port, as importers here are prohibited from
chartering at current figures; the cost deliv
ered here would leave an assured loss. Not- I
withstanding the freight advance on Northern
coals, the selling rates now prevailing here
leave a liberal margin for profit and but little
is yarded, deliveries being made direct to con
sumers; by this a further margin of profit is
secured." . 'â -:.".'

DALTON SNUBBED BY
FORMER SUPPORTERS
Turned Down After Five Years of
Sycophantic Support,
(he Republican Assessor Explains His Position and
Defies Any One to Find Crcokedness in
ills Acts or Figures.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 21.
The statement made In -The Call last
Wednesday that E. Black Ryan might not
deign to come to Oakland to argue for
reductions on Southern Pacific property
has not yet rn-4-n contradicted by that
i-entleman. although it is rumored that he
may appear . to-morrow. Only two more
Jays and the life of the Board of Equali
zation will ejt*pire.
Coroner "ishrmami Is now in the back
ground. it is a case of exit Mehrmann,
enter D_Jton and Black Ryan.
In Tfte Call yesterday morning atten
tion A-as called to the fact that Mr. Dal
ton had cut the assessments of the San
Pablo avenue road to a merely nominal
figure- The right of Mr. Dalton to do
this has been challenged, and certain
criticisms ha--e been made of his assess
ments of railroad property in other
places.
To-day Mr. Dalton published the fol- i
lowing defense of his position: "I re- I
duced the railroad company's assessment :
sn the San Pablo avenue cable road be
cause the road was valueless at the
time the assessment was made, inas
much as the road was then about
to be converted into an electric line. j
It would have cost much less to
nave built the electric road had j
the cable road been out of the way. as |
my fair-minded person will admit. Un- i
tier the law, I am required to fix values j
as I find the property. Shortly after the
first Monday "in March, the San Pablo
_ venue cable road property was to be en
tirely destroyed so far as a street rail
way system was concerned. The electric
road property was not' in such shape as
to be assessed- Next year the electric
road, which has taken the- place of the !
cable on San Pablo avenue, will be as- j
jessed on the me basis as other electric
roads in this county.
"The a-ssessment on the Central Pacific
Railroad Company's thirty-eight acre at
Oakland Point was made this year to con- i
form to a reduction of assessment made j
upon the surrounding property belonging j
to Individual taxpayers, the assessment
delng placed at $5000 per acre, and I defy
any unbiased, â¢ competent person to say j
hat It Is underassessed. Under my prede- ;
. e jsor, sixty-eight teres, including this i
flirty-eight acres, were assessed ai oniy j
.171, 500, whereas the -eight acres are j
assessed by me at $130,00(1 The thirty-eight
acres of this same tract of sixty-eight I
Â»cres are assessed by me at $19-00 more j
nan the whole sucty-eight acres ere as
sessed by my predecessor. If l lie whole
iiuet were assessed by me at the same
rate per acre, it would make an assess
a-tent of $34t*,WO as against $971,800 as made :
by my prodece_.sor.
â¢"Since 1 ha\ c been in office, the State
Hoard of Equalization claims the right to
Â»nd dees assess part ot this tract amount- I
ing to thirty acres as the right of way J
ji, the Central Pacific Railway Company. I
"As to the improvements made at the
s-nd ol the broau gunge mole ouring tne |
j. ast year, fu far as tne tilling in of the j
land is concerned, conies under the juris
diction of tht State Board of Lqualiza- ;
:ion. and is nut assessable by the County
Assessor. . , _
**The Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany's property has been treated by me
tor "assessment purposes this year as in
former years; and will be assessed at Its
actual "cash value for assessment pur- j
-joses so long as 1 remain Assessor of this ,
county. â¢ _ I
â¢'The personal property of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company varies in value
Erom to year according to the
amount and value ol personal property on |
apnd. and is assessed accordingly.
**1 have not made an assessment against
Lhe narrow gau_.e lailroad. roadbed-arid
roiling stock, as the Slate Board of
Equalization claims that right and has
made the assessment, and it has not come
under my jurisdiction to watch the Im
provements made on that line."
The question of assessments has been
taken advantage of by politicians on both
tides of the teuce to renew a struggle
live years old between Assessor Da! ton
ci one side and Supervisors Church, Tub
con and Mitchell on the other side.
The past month has revealed many j
ttrange things in this county family nd. j
Mter five years of sycophantic support!
â â¢f Mr. Dalton a morning Democratic ur- j
-tan has recently taken three opportum-
Lies to administer severe snubs to the
County Assessor. It grasped at th op
porturilty offered by the difference of j
opinion betweeen Mr. I >alton and Stat-
Controller gan to repeat and rerepeat
the information that this quarrel was
holding back the pay of the hundreds uf |
'Choolteacbers in Alameda Count}- It j
next took occasion to reprimand Mr. Dal
ton for not having Indexes to the assess-,
ment rolls ready as soon as the assess
ment rolls were completed. Now, after
the publication in The call that Mr. Dal- j
ton had materially reduced the assess
ment on the San Pablo read he Is -red i
tted inferentially with having beeen ta_.cn
into the railroad camp and with making
in illegal asssessment.
This remarkable change of front has .
caused much winking of eyes and nod
jing of heads. Those who recall the leou
liari combinations made by the D.mo
rratic organ in the county fight last fall
and the municipal campaign this spring
are wondering why such a change has!
_ome about, and the only explanation soT
far considered reasonable is that with
Mr. Dalton aspiring to be a Republican |
member of the next Congress he can no
longer expect anything but snubs and
roasts from a Democratic organ the pro
prletor of which aspires to sit in the |
I â  ted States Senate.
The local newspaper which has always j
supported Mr. Dalton has openly X - |
â tressed Itself on the change in the Assess- !
>r's Democrat^ supporter and In replying
:o one of its recent attacks said:
"In a San Francisco morning dally.;
which seems to be given of late to the ex
ploitation of wild stories and baseless ru
mors, there ears a story to-day that
recently 'a delegation of Indignant tax
payers' waited upon Chairman Talcott of
the Board of Supervisors to make com
plaint that there was no index to the as- !
sessment rolls and that no deputy was
furnished by the Assessor to assist prop- j
;rtv-owr.ers in their hunt for assessments.
"The article continued commenting on
these matters, making It appear that the
Assessor was at fault In not having fur
nished an index or deputy."
The article is then strongly denied.
Mr. Dalton was asked to-day If he Â«new
if any reason why his late Democratic
supporter should have changed its atti
tude and he said that he knew of none.
"All talk that 1 have gone to the rail- j
*oad is absolutely false," said Mr. Dalton. !
"I have always endeavored to be fair. j
That expresses the whole situation." Mr. !
Dalton took from his safe a well-worn I
Sheet of yellow paper on which was some
typewriting, purporting to be a list of the |
candidates for whom the railroad ordered
all its employes to vote. This was pro
fluced at the last election and it was no
ticed that it contained the names of all
the men. whether Republican or Demo
crats, who at that time were being as
tailed by the Examiner. It particularly
mentioned that Captain Hacket't. the
Democratic nominee for Assessor, was
the railroad's choice. Mr. Dalton says i
this is prima facie evidence that he was
not supported by the railroad at the last
county election, notwithstanding the fact
:hat the railroad ward ln -which Mr. Dal
ton lived gave him a vast majority.
Then comes the other side to this pam- |
phlet Incident. It Is remarked that this i
pamphlet never saw the light of day until !
t appeared one morning in Mr Dalton' 8
Democratic supporter of that time. This
ivas construed by the old guard as evl-
Jence that the paper in which It appeared
vaÂ« r_j_non*iibl_ for Its production and It
Is worthy of note In this particular squab
ble that in Alameda County the five men
branded as railroad candidates were
Hackett, Frank Leavitt for Senator, A. A.
MeKeen for Assemblman and W. H.
Church and J. Talcott for Supervisors.
These five were vigorously opposed by
the Examiner, although only Hackett was
a Democrat, and, as It happened, he was
the only one that was not elected to of
fice, Mr. Dalton carrying the plum by an
enormous majority. It is argued that had
the yellow ticket been genuine some of
the railroad odium would have stuck to
the other four or five and not have been
centered entirely against the lone Demo
crat. This is the view taken by the oppo
nents of Mr. Dalton.
Should E. Black Ryan not make his
annual visit here. who. will have kept him
away? This Is the question that follows
upon the muddle previously referred to.
Mr. Dalton says he knows of no reason
why the Southern Pacific should be less
anxious to save taxes this year than last
year, and hints that the explanation of
his absence is probably to be found among
the Supervisors. This is interpreted to
mean that next year three of the Super
visors^ â Messrs. Wells. Roeth and Mitchell
âwill- have to be re-elected if they wish
to hold office and that they would not at
this time be likely to support the conten
tions of the railroad's tax agent.
Now a story has been started that Mr.
DaJton has sometime during the past
year received a deed in some manner to
the portion of the water front property
which he uses in the business of his Iron
foundry at West Oakland. "That story
is entirely without foundation,'' said Mr.
Dalton to a Call man to-day. "I guess
as much as twenty-five years ago my
father acquired a deed to the land on
which the foundry stands, and I do not
know of any other deed concerning the
property which has changed hands sine
then.'" On the other hand, it- Is said that
Mr. Dal ton's firm has a deed on record to
the upland on which the foundry Is locat
ed'but that the firm uses a considerable
portion of water front where vessels load
and discharge and where they have *many
pontoons anchored which is or was the
property of the Water Front Company.
There is. however, no deed on record that
can possibly be construed as bearing out
the story that Mr. Dalton has accepted
any favor from the people he has so long
fought
1:, view of the Interesting political de
velopments of to-day. Dr. Mehrmann ami
the Morgue were forgotten on the street.

MAYOR SNOW HAS
DECIDED TO "CORK UP"
OAKLAND, July 21. Mayor Snow has
sent the following letter to Auditor Breed
concerning the remarks recently made in
a meeting of the Board of Works:
"Friend Breed: I have not cared what
the newspapers have had to say until
now. In defense of the statement that
the clerks in the City Hall earn the pay
they receive I made the rather extrava
gant declaration about Mr. Below' work
at this particular time. This has been
given another meaning. 1 am sure that 1
don't need to say to you that to refer
to you In any way at that time was the
farthest from my thought. As 1 have
perhaps almost said of yon more than
once since April 1 â no man has ever come
into the City Hail with equal competence
so quickly evidenced or doing better or
more faithful work. If it was my busi
ness or disposition to criticize (and you
know it Isn't) 1 couldn't do It. This last
straw breaks the back. 1 have concluded
thai there can be no middle course. I
must 'cork up.' Sincerely yours,
"July 21. IS*l. IC W. SNOAV."
DROPPED A BUCKET
ON HER PRETTY NOSE
OAKLAND, July 21.â Miss Clara John
son, a handsome woman, who has long
been particularly proud of nature's gifts,
hat- sued the Schleuter Company for $275
because through their alleged careless
ness in Iron bucket fell upon her nose
and caused her much pain.
The Schleutt-rs conduct a bazaar on
Washington street and Miss Johnson was
passing by one afternoon when the
bucket, which was suspended outside the
door fell on her face. She was badly
injured, but several doctors succeeded in
fixing the wdund so that she has almost
regained her former, beauty. Miss John
son was some years ago a lady In at
tendance at the royal court of Sweden
and all her connections in her native
country are aristocratic. Her abrupt con
tact with the iron bucket shocked her
pride as well as her physical feelings, and
in addition to the $75 she has paid the
doctors she thinks she is entitled to $200
more for consolation.
SILVER IN THE LAKE.
Interesting Reminiscence of Gold-
Brick Workers.
OAKLAND. July 21.â The dredger now
working on Lake Merritt has dug Into a
silver mine. Recently one of the shovels
-became clogged and a metal brick was
found in the machinery. Contractor
Peterson had it assayed, as it showed
traces of gold. The assay proved that
there is considerable silver in the brick.
The place where it* was found In the
lake is not far from the spot on the Pied
mont shore where the "Indian" who
worked with Root and "Big Foot Dave"
did business three years ago. It is be
lieved that the brick is one of the gold
bricks used by these confidence men and
was thrown into the lake when they found
that their scheme was discovered.

STRICKEN WITH HORROR,
MRS. HILDENBRAND DIES
REALIZED SHE WAS IN THE IN
SANE ASYLUM.
She Had Attacked a Woman With a
Cane and Had Been Confined in
the Hope That Her Facul
ties Would Return.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 21.
Horrified with the terrible realization of 1
' finding herself incarcerated in a cell at :
the Stockton-Insane Asylum, Mrs. Mary
Elizabeth Hildenbrand to-day completely :
collapsed, mentally and physically. Her
death was almost Immediate.
Mrs. Hildenbrand was committed to the j
asylum by Judge Greene only, last :
Wednesday. On the morning of that day
she had attacked Mrs. J. Harlan with a j
cane at San Leandro, breaking the lat- ;
ter's arm and nearly beating her to death.
The Insane woman had been laboring un
der the hallucination that Mrs. Harlan,
who is 72 years of age, was planning to
kill Willie Groff, Mrs. Hildenbrand's
grandson. The demented woman had pre- I
viously attempted to kill the grandson '
herself with an ax. believing thus to frus
trate Mrs. Harlan's imagined scheme."
Mrs. Hildenbrand continued violent from j
the time of the vicious attack on Mrs.
Harlan until she was placed in a. cell at
Stockton. She was accompanied by her j
daughter, Mrs. Louise Groff, residing at
San Leandro. who had arranged to be i
near her mother, for a few days at least,
hoping that she might partially regain her
faculties.
During a lucid interval this morning j
Mrs. Hildenbrand grasped her daughter's i
hand, and suddenly realizing her sad In- |
carceration uttered a terrible shriek, and
falling back upon her cut breathed her
last. Her death is attributed to shock.
â¢ Deceased was a native of Germany,
aged 70 years, and besides the daughter
mentioned leaves another, Mrs. Mary
Boehmer of Alameda, ami a son. Conrad j
Hlldenbrand, residing In San Francisco.

DR LYNCH SERIOUSLY ILL.
I A Young Interne at the City and
County Hospital Sick With
Typhoid.
Dr. Oscar J. Lynch, a young physician,
one of the internes of the City and County
Hospital, is lying seriously ill with ty
phoid fever at that institution. He Is a
graduate of the Cooper Medical College,
and has been a member of the Interne
staff of the hospital since last May, dur
ing which time he made himself very pop
ular, not only with his professional broth
ers but also with the patients in the
wards over which he had been placed.
Dr. Lynch contracted the malady which
now' threatens his life about three weeks
ago while in attendance. upon some of the
nurses who were seized with typhoid fe
ver. Immediately after his illness was
made known to the. hospital officials Drs.
T J. Crowlev, assistant resident physi
cian and A. M. Smith, a young interne
who has attended Dr. Lynch's wards, took
charge of tin patient and rendered him all
the aid In their power; but. with all pos
sible attention, it Is very doubtful if bis
life can be saved, It was stated at a late
hour last night thai the sufferer had one
chance in a thousand to recover.
DONT LIKE CONFINEMENT.
Dr. Arthur Martin Applies for a Writ
of Habeas Corpus.
Dr. Arthur Martin, who gained consid
erable notoriety in ISO! through his con
nection with the case of" Alma Joselyn, a
young girl, who brought grave charges
against her guardian, George Staacke.
and who was** subsequently sent to the in
sane asylum at Ukiah, has applied to
Judge Bahrs for a writ of habeas corpus
i,, his own behalf. In the communication
received by Judge Bahrs from Martin the
insane man states that as he is so con
fined that he cannot give bail he asks
that the court Issue a writ of habeas
corpus. An affidavit attached states that
the applicant is illegally confined and re.
strained of his liberty by K. W. King .'md
I, A Bister in the asylum. Other mat
ters are set forth In the communication,
and as they are. couched in good English
Judge Bahrs made inquiries as to the
mental condition of the patient at this
time Tie has been informed, however,
that' Dr. Martin is not only Insane but
dangerously so. and hence the communi
cation will be ignored.

Out for South Park.
Application was made yesterday by the
Public Administrator for letters testa
mentary upon the estate of John Wallace,
who died in Ireland In February of ISS6.
The application Is made to determine the
ownership of South Park. Wallace was
an heir to the estate of George Cordon,
who, in lS"-4. deeded the park in question
in trust to Arnold Eagle Jr., S. M. Bow
man and George Gordon Jr., the condi
tions of the trust being that the trustees
must keep the park in condition for use
by the public. It Is claimed that the pro
visions of the trust have not been com
plied with. Hence the action to terminate
the trust and determine the ownership of
the land.
FOUND NO GOLD IN
KOTZEBUE COUNTRY
Dr. Stone Says That District Is Fitted
Only for a Penal
Colony.
The Associated Press has received an
other letter from Dr. J. S. Stone, who
went to Kotzebue Sound nearly two years
ago In search of gold. The letter is as
follows:
KOWAK RIVER, Alaska, Jan. 29, 1899.
I wrote you on the Ist Inst, regarding
this country. I now wish to emphasize
my former statements. There is no gold
here. We are only waiting and praying
for the Ice to leave so we can go down the
river to Kotsebue Sound and await the ar
rival of some vessel to take us back to
civilization. Prospecting for gold has
been diligently carried on this winter on
the river and its tributaries. More than
1000 holes have been sunk to bedrock, and
in no single instance has anything been
found. On the Par River bedrock was
reached at 42 feet, no colors; on the Pick,
66 feet; Cogoluctuck, 43 feet; Shungnack,
45 feet; Ambler. 47 feet; Mauneeluck, 42
feet. In no* Instance has anything been
found. We are out of the gold belt as
well as out of civilization.
Mr. Seward, In his purchase of Alaska,
"bulfded" better than he knew. What an
ideal place for a penal colony. If the
States of the Union would only banish to
this country their criminals no greater
punishment could be inflicted. There Is
no escape. For nine months of the year
one is surrounded by ice and the weather
will not permit of travel. For the re
mainder no one would attempt to cross
the swamps, lakes and nlggerheads to get
away. What a saving to the States it
would be. Every prison could be abolished
and a few guards on the coast to arrest
the very few adventurers who might get
away would be all that would be required.
There are 600 men here who want to get
away and transportation' should be af
forded them.

Three Owners for a Purse.
James Sullivan, a sailor, was arrested
yesterday afternoon oh complaint of Mrs.
O. Glover and charged at the O'Farreil
Street Station with grand larceny. Mrs.
Glover alleges that while she was visiting
the Presidio her pocket was picked of a
purse containing about $20. The missing
pocketbook was found and Mrs. Glover
was able to give a good description of it.
Before it was turned over to her two oth
er persons, a man and a woman, visited
police headquarters and claimed the purse
as theirs. Neither could give a descrip
toin of it, however, and neither knew the
amount of money contained In it. II is
believed that they are accomplices of Sul
livan, and they will be closely watched
by the police.
A Socialist Arrested,
Anthony McGinty; a socialist, was ar
rested last night at the corner of Third
and. Market streets and charged with ob
structing the sidewalk. McGinty was ex
plaining to a large crowd the principles
of socialism when Policeman Eastman
ordered him to move on. He refused to
do so and was placed under arrest. The
crowd jeered the officer, and as McGinty
was placed In the patrol wagon his sym
pathizers gave him three loud cheers. At
the prison he was at once released on $20
cash ball.

WINNERS OF
TROPHIES AT
THE DOG SHOW
SANTA BARBARA AWARDS
Judge Payne Criticized Because
of Decisions That Were
Seemingly Biased. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, July 21.â The Santa
Barbara Dog Show Is of the past, and it
has, with few exceptions, left pleasant
memories behind. A. G. Wilson, the sec
retary, and J. R. Park, assistant, have
greatly contributed to this end, and the
visitors to Santa Barbara have been
greatly impressed with the hospitality dis
played on all sides. Judge Daingerfield of
San Francisco, who has been a frequent
attendant of the show, is no mean con
noisseur of dogs, and he expressed sur
prise at the high quality of those shown.
The Judge, whose wit is as well known as
his legal acumen, was reminded by this
show of the dinner given to Judge .M -
Kenna on his elevation to the Circuit
Court, when thirty Judges graced the
festive board, and he remarked that it
was the greatest bench show he had ever
seen.
An unprecedented feature of the show
was the competition of about forty mon
grels, accompanied by as. many street
Arabs, for prizes for the ugliest dogs in
Santa Barbara. The prizes were $20 for
flrst, $10 for second and $5 for third. The
first prize was won by a girl. Josle Dota,
with Police, a small black and white non
descript that she found starving and lost
and had taken up out of charity. The
second prize fell to J. R. Barado Jr. fur
a dirty white looking enigma that had a
bulldog ancestor in the dim vista of the
past. Third prize fell to a half-bred
Mexican, Tootsie. owned by Adriano
Basquez. The competition excited great
amusement among the spectators, and
Mr. Underbill's awards met with loud ap
plause.
At the end of the judging an auction
sale was held, and N. J. Stewart of Aro
mas had the pleasure of selling two collie
dog puppies, by Ormskirk Blueher out of
Crapton Miss Rose, at a good figure, one
to D. Byron Erkenbrecher of Los Angeles
ana the other to Miss L. E. Hart of Santa
Barbara. Mr. Rutherford of Santa Bar
bara bought Countess Rosemel, by Cham
pion Melrose out of Valkyrie, from C. K.
Barker of San Jose. This show evidently
imbued the Santa Barbarenos with the
dog fever, for A. G. Wilson has arranged
to take fifteen dogs to the Seattle show
In September.
The awards for specials, as a rule, were
fair, though some of Mr. Payne's decisions
must have been dictated by personal bias,
as mere Ignorance could not account for
them. Mr. Sumner's decisions awarding
to Sweet William all the prizes for which
he was eligible were universally indorsed,
for the pup is one of the finest fox ter
riers ever bred on the coast.
Mr. Payne awarded the special for best
Great Dane to Miss L. E. Hart's Riband
II; a dog with nothing but a fair body to
recommend him. In view of this fact
John L. Cunningham's Champion Juanita
also ran. The decision is as rank a one
as was ever seen and can only be ex
plained on the ground of the judge's per
sonal animus against Juanita's owner.
Viking, the dog that was placed second
to Riband II In the open class, excelled
the latter In every way though he was
not as good as Juanita. Another ridicu
lous decision was the award of the special
for the best St. Bernard to King Mene
lek over Omar Khayyam. The latter is
so much the superior that no comparison
can possibly exist. It is considered un
likely that H. T. Payne will ever judge
the bench show in Santa Barbara again.

Stelzner and Jeffords.
J. D. Glbbs. matchmaker of the Na- â¢
tlonal Athletic Club, is trying to bring
about another meeting between boxers â 
Jeffords and Stelzner on the night of the j
NHll-McConnell bout. They fought in the
ring of the San Francisco Athletic Club
some months since, when Stelzner .won i
after an uphill battle. Jeffords' showing !
with Jones on Thursday night is not
taken as a measure of his form. It is
recalled that Jeffries made a similar
showing with ''Mexican Pete" Everett at :
th* Olympic Club when they met. The '
latter doubled himself up like Jones, and
Jeffries was in doubt as to what he should
do.
It is expected Stelzner and Jeffords will
â soon reach an understanding as to the
purse lor which they will agree to box.

GREAT GRAPE GROWERS
ACCEPT CROCKER'S OFFER
-
The enterprise of Henry J. Crocker, in
which he offers to buy all the dry wine
grapes in the State at a rate of $12 and
$14 per ton for the next seven years ha:
been received with great favor In the va
rious districts where meetings of growers
have been held. It remains, however, for
the Italian-Swiss colony to give the plan
its most substantial and momentous send
off.
In a letter to Mr. Crocker under date
of yesterday Secretary Sbarboro of that
Institution shows the grape growers of
the State his faith In the movement.- He
says:
Enclosed please find postal card favorably
accepting your proposal to buy our grapes for
the next seven years at $14 per ton for stand
ard grades and $12 per ton for Mission and
Malvaslas. We have about 1000 acres of vines,
which produce 2000 to .'i"" -1 tens of grapes,' in
accordance with the season, all the vineyards
not yet being in. bearing.
If the srrape growers of the State act to their
best Interests and accept your proposition the
colony will continue to set out more vines from
year to year until its large tracts of land will
have been all planted. If you -succeed, as we
hone you will, in your laudable undertaking,
the people of California, In whatever pursuit
engaged, will be grateful to you for having
saved and brought to a paying basis what
should eventually be one of the greatest indus
tries ot the State.
SOLDIERS WHO BEG.
Three Arrested and Will Be Turned
Over to the Military Author
ities To-Day.
The practice of soldiers begging on the j
streets has incensed the authorities at the j
Presidio and a severe example will be |
made of those offending. John McGrath, j
who begged from Major Noble, was
turned over to the military authorities
Thursday by Judge Treadwell, and yes
terday a similar request was made to
Judge Conlan in the cases of three other
soldiers.
Edward Noonan of the Twelfth Infan
try and Patrick O'Connor and Frank Sny
der, casuals, were arrested about 1 o'clock
yesterday morning on Montgomery street
by Policeman Leonard for begging. Leon
ard watched them for several blocks and |
saw them solicit money from every per- !
son they met. When he went up to them j
they had the effrontery to ask him for
car fare to take them to the Presidio, I
although all cars had stopped running at
that hour. When searched Noonan hail I
55 cents in his pocket; O'Connor 40 cents :
and Snyder -â¢' cents. They were all un
der the influence of liquor. ;
The Judge received a message from the
Presidio to keep the three men in custody j
till to-day, when an officer would be sent |
to take them to the Presidio, where they |
will be punished.
THEIR MEMORIES DEFECTIVE. j
Three Women Witnesses in the Case
of Charles Wyman Warned by-
Judge Treadwell.
The preliminary examination of Charles
Wyman on the' charge of assault to mur
der, now proceeding in Judge Tread-well's
court, is developing into a farce, and yes
terday the Judge was so incensed that
he threatened to send three women wit
nesses to prison, as he whs satisfied they
were not telling the truth, but he after
ward relented. ,
Wvman was at a social at Mrs. Dolan s
house 431 Jessie street, on the night of
June S. During the height of. the festivi
ties Wyman and John Rank quarreled
and Rank was stabbed twice. For a time
it was thought that the wounds would
prove fatal, but Rank recovered.- He now
refuses to prosecute the, case.
Alice Dent. 544 Minna street: Mrs. Do
lan the hostess, and Mrs. Watts, 1112
Howard street, testified yesterday, but
their evidence was in direct contradiction
to what they told the police on the night
of the affray r . ,
That was what angered the Judge and
be ordered them to be In court on Monday,
warning them to he prepared to tell the
truth then. Rank, who has a charge of
vagrancy pending against him, was or
dered into custody.

His Own Carelessness.
An inquest was held by Coroner -â  >il
yesterday on t..e body of Carlo Solari,
who was killed on the 19th of this month
by being run over by a steam dummy on
the Cliff House route. There was some
conflict in the testimony of witnesses as
to whether the bell of the train thai
struck Rolari was ringing, but the evi
dence was unanimous on the point that
the train was in motion when Solari
jumped and that if the bell was ringing
the trains were so close together at tho
time the unfortunate man Jumped that it
would have been Impossible to have
stopped the dummy in time to save him
F. J. Tutenberg. the fireman, and Samuel
Smith, the engineer, testified positively
that the bell was ringing and that the en
gineer shouted at Solari. The jury re
turned a verdict that the deceased came
to his death through his own carelessness
by jumping off the train while it was in
motion.
Sunday Requiem Masses Forbidden.
It has been the custom In many Catholic
churches in this archdiocese to have re
quiem masses celebrated on Sundays be
tween the hours of 9 and half-past 9
o'clock.- This has been a serious incon
venience to pewholders, who have been
compelled to give up their seats tomourn
ers attending the requiem services. The
Archbishop has just issued a regulation
directing the clergy in charge of parishes
not to hold requiem masses on Sundays
hereafter. Such services may be held on
any other day of the week.
The people of Brazil have learned to
make their own beer and native brewer
ies now supply nearly all the demand.

SLASHED HIS ABDOMEN
WITH A SMALL KNIFE
PETER jrURAN", A COOK, AT
TEMPTS SUICIDE.
Having Been Accused of Theft, He
Preferred Death to a Life At
tended by Disgrace.
Peter Jiuran, a cook, attempted suicide
in the Fairweather chophouse, 242 East
etreet, yesterday morning by ripping his
abdomen with a pocket-knife. He was
discovered In a precarious condition six
hours after he committed the act and
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
Where his wounds were pronounced prob
ably fatal by Dr. Morrison. Jiuran made
the attempt upon his life for the reason
that he had been accused of stealing by
Frank Loretovich, the proprietor of the
chophouse.
Jiuran has been employed on East street
for about fifteen days. During this time
his employer took a vacation and left the
cook in charge of the lace. ' When he
returned some trouble over the receipts
of the house occurred, in which Jiuran
was accused of heft. Thursday nit;: the
latter retired to his room after having
ohatt.-d pleasantly with his friends dur
ing the evening and said nothing which
would indicate that" he contemplated sui
cide. He was absent from his work yes
terday morning and during the afternoon
was discovered in a room In tie house
with four Ugly wounds in his abdomen.
The physicians at the Harbor Hospital
discovered that the man used a penknife
with a blade about an inch and a half
in length in his attempt to end his life.
He made four ugly incised wounds across
Ins body, none of which penetrated the
Intestines. From the condition of the
wounds it is supposed that he used the
knife about 9 o'clock in* the morning and
must have suffered for six hours.
Jiuran has been in San Francisco for
the past nineteen rears. He is well known
as a cook about town. Last night he re
covered sufficiently to make a statement.
In which he said that the charge of dis
honesty preferred against him by his em
ployer and the fear of its subsequentdam
age to his reputation caused him to com
mit the deed. He claims that he has al
ways been honest and denies the charge
of Loretovich. He is about 50 years of
age and is believed to be mentally de
ranged.

DEAD TO THE WORLD.
A Convict Sentenced for Life Cannot I
Inherit Property.
The Supreme Court has decided that
when a man is civilly dead, that Is. serv
ing a sentence of imprisonment for life,!
he forfeits his right to Inherit property, 1
the same as though he was actually "un
der the sod." The decision on this point
was In the case of the estate of Thomas
Donnelly, deceased. Donnelly died intcs- j
t i- 1 . on February 17, 1896, and in Decem- |
ber, 1897, the Judge of the Probate Court
of this city made a decree of distribution j
of the estate. The property was divided
among the widow and three children.
There was a fourth child. James J. Don
nelly, who in IS." l * was sentenced to serve
the i remainder of his natural life in the:
State prison-. After the death of his
father the convict assigned his supposed
#hare of the estate to Charles J. Stillwell. j
a private detective, who applied to. the
lower court for the share that would have j
been that of the convict had the latter
kept out of the State prison. Stllwell's
application was denied by the lower court
on the ground that James J. Donnelly be- .
big civilly dead was to all Intents and pur
poses actually dead. This was upheld by !
the Supreme Court. _ j
Mrs. Williford's Death.
A Coroner's jury decided yesterday that !
Mrs. Adeline Williford of 512 Brannan J
street came to her death from senile
peritonitis following a criminal operation
committed by herself.' The testimony of
Mrs. Kittle Walker and Drs. William
Bell and Arthur L. Sobey was that Mr.?.
Williford confessed to them that she Â« is
the cause of the Injuries which she was
found to have sustained.
PHELAN WAS THE THEME.
Fortieth District Democratic i
Club Meeting at Point
Lobos-.
The Fortieth District Democratic Club |
met with civic fervor last night on the
corner of Point Lobos and Masonic av
enues. James D. Phelan and local Dem- I
ocracy were the songs the orators of the I
evening sang.
President Bernard Blenenfeld of the.'
district club opened the meeting. J. J. j
Harrison, chairman of the meeting, was j
introduced. He spoke in an introductory
way of the purposes of the assemblage i
and called upon Morris V. Samuels, the ;
attorney, for a few remarks on Phelan
and the denial:.: * of the time on all good
Democrats. - "It will be a hard fight,"
said Samuels, "and every man should take
off his coat with a willingness to work for ,
Jam- D. Phelan, decency and Democ- ;
racy." j
The speech of the evening was made by i
A. C. Sweigart, who consumed an hour j
in eulogistic phrases to describe the civic
virtues of the Mayor. He roasted and j
grilled Buckley and his henchmen and |
prayed for a general election of all good
Democrats.
ANTI-BOSS MEETING.

ceiving a fair and satisfactory consider- j
ation, so that a full ticket opposed to
bosses would .be placed In the contest at
the primaries regardless of any other -Re
publican organization.
Resolutions were unanimously adopted
I advising the publicans of the Thirtieth
I District who are opposed to further boss
I rule to abstain from affiliating with or

I and appro - ed of the objects of the Affili
j ated League of Republican Clubs.
The executive committee reported that
a thorough canvass had been made of tho

L Thirtieth District, and sufficient data has
been gained to justify the statement that
the Affiliated League ticket will carry the
district at the primary election and ere
] mate the bosses forever.
The club accepted invitations for affilia- I
tion and co-operation with the Thirty-first
District publican Club (Stanford Club), j

The tax paying classes of the Repub
lican party of the city, embracing work

that the district bosses soon perceived
that programme methods would not
win, and did not attempt, except in
two or three instances, to resist the on
set ol the stanch Republicans.
The large enrollment last night sig
nifies that the Republican masses have
resolved to take the reins of party
management in their own hands and
select a municipal nominating conven
tion which shall' be composed of the
highest grade of citizenship.
The success achieved last night by
the people will encourage Republicans
who have hitherto manifested hut slight
interest in local politics to come for
ward and enlist for the municipal cam
paign new at hand. The club rolls will
he pen daily from 8 to 10 p. ni., until

ins-Kelly Combination Turned
Down by True Republicans.

j thorough manner, saying that the Re- I
i publicans of that district had declared in
favor of a clean primary and pure poll

! would not agree to "do politics" in any
such a manner.
His declaration was greeted with a :
! storm of applause, out of which arose one '
; lone protest against what the person was
; pleased to call "treason to the party." |
The lone protestant was Colonel E. S. :
| Salomon, and though he waved his walk
ing stick frantically and raised his voice
I to a high pitch he was unable to finish
'â  his speech, for the cheering of Hayes' |
remarks. At last, disgusted with the re
' ception, he strode angrily out of the hail, :
followed by about twenty of the adher
ents of the Fifth and Market street
bosses. The remainder of the business.
was transacted with dispatch. Albert L* -
i wald was selected as chairman, W. K.
Owens as secretary, Charley Linehan and
S. Hlbby as sergeants-at-arms. The en- \
rolling committee selected consisted of I
Edward Head, J. H. J. Seyden, H. J. j
| Alexander, J. H, Scott and B. G. Haskell. I
In accepting the position as committee- i

i things to say of the attempts of the
! Crlmmlns-Keiiy combination to secure I
! control of the Republican party. About
] 175 residents of the district signed tne

MISSING COMPLAINT
FOR A MISSING MAN
"BRICK" McPHERSON MAY HAVE
MADE HYPNOTIC PASSES.
Suspicion Grows That the Police
Courts Have Been Used to Give
Color to a Contemplated
Swindle.
The hypnotic Influence the notorious
"Brick" McPherson is supposed to have
exercised over so many San Franciscans
with money seems to be potent in the lo
cal police courts. At any rate, the com
plaint the ruddy "Brick" swore to last
Wednesday in Judge Treadwell's court,
charging one Thomas R. Davis with the
embezzlement of $100,000, has disappeared
from the archives.
Clerk McQuade declares that he never
saw it and knows nothing about it. The
Judge knows nothing about it. and Car
penter says he handed it to Clerk Mc-
Quade. â¢:
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter drew up
the complaint at the request of Attorney
Harvey Brown, but says that he knew
nothing of the particulars; as Brown as
sured him that everything was all right
he did not trouble himself.
Judge Treadwell says that Carpenter
presented the complaint to him and he
signed it. He saw McPherson at Carpen
ter's elbow, and remarked: "It's a
strange thing to see you in the role of
prosecutor." Having faith in Carpenter,
lie did not ask for particulars.
The Davis wanted appears to be as
evanescent as the complaint, and the sus
picion is deepening that he. is ah astral
body projected into the scene by a few
swift passes from "Brick," in furtherance
of a scheme to make some people believe
that he "looks like money."
There the celebrated case rests.
