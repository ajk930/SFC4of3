SOLVES A MYSTERY
OF CARSON CANYON
Body of Murdered Peter Lorraine
Found in the "Black Hole"
of Marin.
SAX RAFAEL, IVr. IS.â The cloud of
murder mystery hanging over Carson
Canyon, which has given It the name of
tho "Wack HoiÂ© of Marln"â a cloud as
dark as thÂ© shadows lurking in th<*
gloomy depths of that mountain fast
nessâwu partially dispelled to-night by
a telegram *-ent to Sheriff Taylor by
John Knos. foreman of .the Howard-
Shaftcr estate. It Â«a.Â« briefly announced
Jn tho dispatch that the body of Peter
I-Traino, the woodchopper who has been
mlcslnff since May 1 last, ha.l been found.
Tho discovery Â«>f the body forges the
lust link In the chain of circumstantial
evidence connecting Suspect James Pier
with thrÂ» murder, and to-night telegrams
were Cashed to nil parts of the State
ordering the arrest of Dier wherever he
j.arly In the morning Sheriff Taylor
nn<l Coroner ]Â£den will proceed to Car
t <>:i Canyon and thoroughly Investigate
tho circumstances leading to the dls
Â«<\rry. It is believed by these official*
that the finding Â«'f the body will not only
tea guilt upon lÂ»ler. but undoubtedly
will 1r.1,1 to the unearthing Â«if evidence
(â¢howlng that the headwaters of Lagu
jilias Creek have been a lair for human
h>Â«-n:is, a spot where any man who dared
to lmur the hatred of his fellows was
kept under surveillance JÂ«y a clique of as
s;i>.-ins until an opportunity arrived for
hi* llfÂ© to pay the penalty. Everybody
nt thÂ« wood choppers' camp will be ar
i.st.vi. brought to town and kept here
until .ifter the inquest.
IVter Lorraine was a woodchopper. aged
tibout CO years, who, previous to his dls
j:pj(f.irajjc<?, had l>een employed by John
Knon, foreman of the Shafter estate in
< 'arson Canyon, ton miles from San Ra-
Jael. In a. separate room of the same
cabin with Lorraine lived ... Dler.
who ha<l been employed by Enos a 1;a 1 ; a
Woodchopper for almost two years. ith
:jt n had unsavory reputations and were
constantly quarreling, so when Lorraine
disappeared on May ] it was only a short
tsinf until the oth< r wr*odchoppers begin
I â  make ugly insinuations that Dier knew
whither hisÂ« house mate had ntÂ».
< 'ii June C Bnos gave Sheriff Taylor in
' rmatloa which caused him to arrest
II ' â ' r. Th<Â» prisoner showed his blood
!;!rsjy propensities by trying to shoot
Taylor when he was arrested; but on be-
B placed in Jail relapsed Into a morose
Btate and would Rive no other informa
tion than that at one time he had been
employed by a man namr-d Miles in the.
SuiSlin Valliy.
3t w.tk hhown that on the day after
'French Pete." am Lorraine was called.
Dier had shown considerable
citation when questioned regarding the
ilsVlng man's wh< rra'Â»outs. nnd also that
â¢ â :â â :â¢â¢ had a bitter quarrel the day be
fore IVto vanished.
Ixirraln^ was last seen at about noon on
th<-- day of lils diÂ«;ip;><-aranee on a lonely
path J.adlng from a small store kept by
I-Inos to thn woodchopper'u cabin. I â¢). r '
fail.vl to account f.ir his own wherea.bouts
that particular time. A number of
metropolitan detectives were employed
to wÂ«>rk Â«.n the case and discovered
enough evidence to hariÃ Dier had they
been able t<Â» locate the body of thÂ«> miss-
Ins man. hut their efforts were balned by
the fact that a heavy shower' on May 2
had Obliterated all trace of the body being
dragged over th>Â» urround or burled.
â¢ '!:â â¢ day Dier iff-mlsed to make a cor- j
*> eslon if the officials called upon him two
hours later. When they returned their in
dipnation and dIFRUHt were unlimited on ''
learning that a yellow journal '.'special I

Shortly afterward he was released and
permitted to roturn to Carson Canyon,

the "Black Hole of Matin" on account of
its tragedies and the mystery that en

TELEPHONE COMPANY
ABSORBED IN SAN JOSE
Sunset Line Purchases the Property
and Franchise of the Local
Corporation.
SAN JOSE. Dec. IS.â Tho Sunset Tele
t phone Company has absorbed the People's
Telephone Company, â  local corporation.
This transaction was made public to-day
through circulars issued by the Sunset
Company. Until a few years ago the peo
ple of the Garden City were charged enor
mous rates for telephones. With the or
ganization of the People's Company they
were cut in two and the service Improved
all round.
The main stockholder In the People's
Company was Henry T. Pierce of San
Francisco. His interest has boon purchas
ed. Small local stockholders know noth
ing of the transaction ami have not been
asked to nell their stock. John I. Sabin
has dealt directly with Pierce and it is
more than likely tho little stockholders
will receive nothing. The circular sent
out by the purchaser states that rates will
not be raised by the Sunset Company.
The transfer takes place January 31,
KÂ«Â«(.. The price paid cannot be learned.
The circular states "that the only object
the Sunset Company has In paying any
thing for. the property is to relieve their
subscribers from the necessity of paying
two rentals and having two telephones."
It Is claimed the new company did not
reduce rates. The Sunset Company states
it will reduce the charges of the two party
line service from $5 to $3 TÂ«0 per month on
and after the consolidation, and also con
tracts at present rates can be entered Into
for nny time up to fifty years.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1899.
BULLER REPORTED TO HAVE
CROSSED THE TUGELA AFTER
A STIFF FIGHT WITH BOERS
Following This Dispatch, However, Corses a Second
Story Stating That Methuen's Force
Is in Great Danger.
LONDON, Dec. 19.â Through a source which is usually inspired by the best
authority 1 learned early this morning that late last night two very important
dispatches from the commander in chief in South Africa had been received in
London. One of these dispatches stated that General Buller had made a second
attempt to cross the Tugsla River, and, after a stiff fight, had succeeded in
doing so. At what point this crossing was made is not stated, nor was any
thing said as to whether the Boers had been driven out of their entrenchments
The other dispatch was to the effect that Lord Methuen's communications
had been cut and it was possible that a flank attack threatened the safety of
his column. At the War Office late last night inquiry as to news from Buller
elicited the evasive reply that the War Office had no news to issue to-night
As a rule answers at the War Office to questions of this kind is that no
further news had been received.
LONDON, Dec. 19.â At last
the details of the battle at
the Tugela are coming
through, but very slowly, and the
stories are mostly incomplete.
All the dispatches bear evidence
of being severely censored. For
instance, General Buller's official
report stated that he had lost
eleven guns, but this fact has
been carefully cut out <>f every
message by the censor, who evi
dently was in ignorance of what
news the War ( Mtice had given to
the public. We now know that
General Hart's brigade did actu
ally cross the Tugela, but had to
be withdrawn, losing very heav
ily; that General Hildyard's bri
gade was also checked, and that
Genera] Barton's brigade, of
whose doings nothing had been
heard, failed t<> carry Inhlawe
Hill, which is a position on the
smith side of the Tugela to the
west of Colenso.
There is no further explana
tion of the loss of the artillery. It
is said that Colonel Long. %v ho
had been much Mimed for tak
ing his guns too near the Boers,
was probably obliged to do so. In
Queenstown, Northern Cape Colony, Gen. Gatacre's Base.
This town lie* south of the Btormh*>rg Mountains, on the Eusu-rn Hailn.ad
line. 154 mile? from East London, on the Indian Ocean, and 126 mil. s fr-ini
Hethuli.' brfdee, by whioh tho road crosses th.^ Orange RlvÂ«Â»r. It was early
chosen as General Oatscre'i baM and he hi now retiring from Pntten kraal to
ward it. as the Boers from Dordrecht are thn-atenlns it on the flank
this connection it li pointed out
thai Colonel Long has the repu
tation of being a very good offi
cer. We are expressly told the
reason, namely, that he was
aiycious to get within effective
range of the enemy.
"It is tile old, old story." said
an artillery expert. "The officers
and gunners of the Royal Artil
lery are second to none, hut their
guns are obsolete. It is certain
that the reverses which have of
late been suffered by the British
have been for the most part the
result of imperfect performance
of scouting duties, not merely
general scouting duties, which
are under the direction of the
headquarters staff, but of duties
for which generals commanding
brigades, colonels commanding
battalions and regiments, and
majors and captains commanding
batteries and companies are re
sponsible. The Hritish officer is.
as a rule, especially in the early
part of the campaign, so keen to
get at his work and so eager to
join in the issue at once with the
enemy that he is very apt to for
get or to hurry over the prelim
inary precautionary measures."
"So much depends upon Lord
Roberts and Lord Kitchener that
it is to be hoped." says the Dairy
Mail, "that no further War Office
red tape and none of the jeal
ousies between generals that are
said to exist there will tie the
hands of the new chiefs. In the
important matter of artillery, if
the two men who go forth under
such immense national responsi
bility think it necessary that
they should have the best artillery
that England, America or Ger
many can provide, let them have
it. and the Government should
insist that Sir Michael Hicks-
Beach shall be no longer allowed
to further sacrifice officers and
men in South Africa by his hope
less notions of imperial finance."
Many letters written to Lon
don papers direct criticism
against some departments of the
War Office and against Sir
Michael J licks-Beach, General
Buller and Lord Wolseley. In
the eves of many. Lord Wolseley
is held responsible for maintain
ing his position as commander
in chief for several years, know
inp. as Ik must have known. th:it
tno antiquated British artillery
would he outranged on its first
meeting- with any adequately
armed force.
A telegram comes this morn
ing which states that < leneral
French has been obliged to evac
uate Vaalkop because of the
weakness of his artillery. Lady
smith would have been obliged
to surrender long ago hut for the
hurried dragging up from some
warships of bitf naval guns. It is
a sad thing to say. but true, that
the artillery of the richest coun
try in the world is less effective
than much that is possessed by a
nation whom certain journals and
orators some weeks ago insisted
upon describing as a small hand
ful of farmers.
TROOPS TO BE RUSHED

PANIC CONDITIONS
IN WALL STREET
Nearly Two hundred Per Cent
Offered for Loans Dur
ing the Day.
NEW YORK, Dec. Panic conditions
developed on the Stock Exchange this aft
ernoon, with the Imperative need of
money developed by the violent contrac
tion in values. Stocks were being thrown
over without the slightest regard to the
price they would I ring and at distressing
sacrifices of values. No end to the help
lessness of the situation seemed in night
when In the last half hour of the market
some $10,000,000 was offered on the stock
exchange by the concerted action of the
CU-aring-house banks to force the rate
arbitrarily down to 6 per cent without re
gard to the distracting bidding at higher
rates which . was being done by other
brokers for distressed operators. The
collapse In the. money rate checked .the
decline and drove the bears to cover. The
recoveries produced by their urgent bid
ding were almost as violent as the de
clines established and the losses were by
no means entirely retrieved. Large offer-
Ings of stocks continued at the rally and
at MMM points. of the list prices broke
anew before the close, making the clos
ing exceedingly irregular and unsettled.
The excitement continued to the end,
with the street looking forward anxiously
for the developments of another day.
â  The seriousness of the crisis has called
forth the best efforts of powerful and
conservative financial Interests, which are
busy concerting measures to tide over the
money difficulties which beset the stock
market and which by reason of their ex
tent and the Importance of the interests
involved threaten to affect the country's
business interests unless obstacles an op
posed.
It is considered a point pained to have
effected a cessation of the ruthless sacrl
ti< â¢â¢ ol values long â¢â¢k'iuku lor .1 period of
consideration over night, for the selling
of stocks had unquestionably reached thaÂ»
stage where ordinary considerations of
pruuunce or even of necessity nail been
thrown to the wind, and the sufferers
from the money stringency were unload
ing the holdings in the true panic spirit.
A pause of .1 tew noun for consideration
is likely In Itself to do much toward rec
tifying such a condition.
So far at actual news was concerned to
day there was a suspension by a newly or
ganised trust company and by .1 Ural of
bankers and brokers who have figured an
traders in stocks to an extent of some im
portance. Neither event in itself would
nave been sufficient to precipitate actinia,
but they were supplemented with s wholt
crop of wild and incoherent rumors which
spared no Interest however powerful,
long established and hltfierto free from
suspicion it may have been. One would
think from the # nnr of Home .1 the gossip
thai was tloating about by telegraph, by
telephone and by messengers or by whis
pen and even by shouting. in the lobbies
of the Stock Exchange that the whole
financial fabric bad been undermined nnd
was about to tumble in ruins. V. the day
closed with the two failure* above men*
tioned ns the sum total of disaster so far
as admitted insolvency was concerned.
The reason for the widespread effect
upon sentiment of the trust company's
suspension was that it was one of â  lnrÂ«je
number of Uu uiutloi recently formed on
Blmllar lines and which have thn â¢â¢ i

have been a feature of the past year
The securities of these combinations hi

street for many weeks pastâ in fact ever
since the headlong Inflation In their prtfes
and subsequent collapse last spring The
disfavor which Is attached to them in
Wall street has been quite indiscriminate
and based upon many varying considera
tions. The principal allegations aga nsi
them are. overcapitalization, exorbitant
prices paid for constituent property hi d
vulnerability to existing and threatened
legislation against combines. It is evi
dent that in so largo a number of combin
ations as have been made these allega
tions can scarcely apply to all alike; but

the sheep have not bern separated from
the goats In Wall street and some of tno
!â¢ .1.-1 fortunate of the new combinations
have been affiliated with the trust com
pany which closed Its doors to-dny. The
incident rausrd v feeling of d*Â£tnuM -aril ri
regard to the whole class of linlu-rri.il
securities, tv Is sufficiently evident (.urn
the wide breaches made In the value of
this class o:' securities In the day's tud
lr.K.
It Is to l>e noted also that th* very
heavy commitments of capital to the trust
form of enterprise Itself and its Incur
sions on the banking field h;ive arouju-d,
much discussion. li has been obvious for
many months pant thai a great deal of

In these new Industrial combinations,
which were becoming burdon.iome to enr

money in the regular channels, the 1..r->.Â»
absorption of funds by reason of the Jjv
ernment's surplus revenues nnd thÂ»Â« ur
gent needs of the lymdon money market,
growing out of the Transvaal war. l-nt

MORGAN ON TRUSTS.
Alabaman Calls Up His Resolution
in the Senate.
WASHINGTON. Dec* IS. â What the
Senate may accomplish m th.' way of leg-
Islation for the Philippine! during the
present session is problematical, but that
the question will be thoroughly discussed
la Indicated by the number of resolutions
waring upon it being Introduced. In op
position of the* retention by the United
States of the Philippines Islands, two res
olutions wero Introduced to-day, one by
Tillman of South Carolina and the other
by Bacon of Georgia. Each purposes to
yield the Inlands to a government to be
established by the Filipino* themselves.
Mora of Alabama called up his reso
lution "to prohibit combinations between
corporations to* control interstate com
merce and transportation." Morgan said
he regarded the evils called "trusts" as
all included in the combinations of per
sons to control trade. What an individual
could accomplish In trade was regarded
as legitimate, but when great corpora
tions were aggregated together to con
trol any branch of trade or commerce or
transportation it became evident that the
rights of the people were likely to be in
fringed. Ho declared that all the advan-
r.-ii>!- which had boon gained by the trusts
had been obtained at the expense of the
people, and particularly of labor.
"1 desire to know." he said,' "whether
this Congress will respond to the almost
despairing demand of the people for re
lief."
Morgan snoke briefly, his argument lÂ»o
itig directed particularly to the members
of the Committee on Judiciary., to which
at the conclusion of his speech his resolu
tion was referred.

HANNA ARRAYED
AGAINST BURNS
Wants California's Legislature to
Meet and Elect Some Other
Candidate.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WK1.1.1N.;-
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Dec I*.-
The Washington â pedaJ to the NÂ«w rork
Herald '"i;cv>rnlnÃ the Quay contest
rÂ»-aÂ«l with interfst In Washington to-day.
\ -ntw-r "i the National I
Committee from â  northeastern St.it'- .-i n . i

Inc:
"I believe it to be true that the admin
istration, through Senator Mark Hanna.
chairman of the National Republican
Committee, la urging that California's
Legislature meet In special session, and
among those who know something of
national politics, it is understood that this
is the result of an appeal made to Sena-
I tory Hanna by Mr. Quay. You will re
member, perhaps, a report current some,
months ago that Pennsylvania's vote
! would be solidly for McKinley â¢and that
: the administration in return would throw
Its Influence to Quay in his struggle to re
tain his place In the Senate.
"Quay realizes that the candidacy of
Colonel Burns of California would bo
hurtful to his own prospects. You notice
that the Herald said Senators have been
bombarded with marked copies of John
i Wanamaker's paper the Philadelphia
I North Americanâ while each Senator has
| been receiving the San* Francisco Call reg
i ularly, and thai these papers published
Governor Gage's intention to appoint
j Burns Senator in case Quay were seated
) and at the same time made complete cx
i posures of Burns' unsavory record.
"It Is well known that John Wana
maker and Quay both aspire to lead Perm-
I sylvanla Republican politics. ,\Vana
: maker does not spare energy or money to
.' defeat Quay. He even went so far as to
| purchase a newspaperâ the North Ameri
; canâ to use against Quay.
"Wanamakor Is no amateur as a poli
tician himself. He learned something of
Burns' record In California and Inquired
of California people if the charges made
i against him were true. L'pon being told
that they were and that his .paperâ the
â  North Americanâ need nave no fear of
libeling, he at once set about employing
pome California newspaper man. who was
i familiar with California politics and with
! Burns' record and who at the same time
! could wield â  trenchant pen.
"Arthur McKwen was recommended.
! Wanamakor employed him at or.cc and

sent him to Washington. McEwen's arti
cles showing up the character of the Call
fornian. who will be a colleague of re
spectable Senators if Quay be seated, have i
shocked Senators. They realize that If
they vote to seat Quay they must. In or
der to be consistent, vote for Burns also.
"It will be i ten at once that Wana
maker'a shrewd bum of using Burns". 1
malodorous record to defeat Quay was
calculated to have a most damaging ef
fect on Quay's prospects. So Quay ap
pealed to Chairman Hanna to urge a
special session of the California Legisla
ture In order to avert the necessity of
an appointment by Governor Gage, who
would have named Rums.
"I see by press dispatches this morning
that some of Burns' friends now declare
that hÂ«- would not accept an appointment,
but that efforts are being made to call a
special session to elect a Senator. These
dispatches were published in the East to i
holp Quay."
â¢â¢But." asked The Call representative. I
'â¢you do not believe that Senator Hanna
In his desire to help Mr. Quay would he \
willing to do anything so hurtful to the '
Republican part} as to urge a special ses
sion which would result In Colonel Burns'
election?"
"Of course not." responded the skillful!
polltiiliui. with a smile of pity. "Mr.
Hanna has faith enough in California Re
publicans. He knows th^t the decent ele
ment made a determined resistance to i
IJurns' election and held the fort for sev- ,
eral months and compelled the Burns
force* to retire last winter. Ho knows
that they will make such a determined
defense again and that Burns cannot win.
No. Indeed: Mr. Hanna has thÂ« welfare of
the Republican party at h'.irt and favors 1
"a meeting of iiiÂ«- California Legislature, I
believing thai it will i-house an honest
m.in for I'nited States Senator.
"In other words, he realizes that Gover
nor Gage would be certain to appoint j
Burn*, while the chances would be alto
gether that the Legislature would Hect ,
some one else, and this. In bis opinion. Is \
a consummation devoutly to be wished
for the sake of the national Republican
party, of which he is chairman.
"Hanna is a great politician. By this
move he expects to accomplish two re- i
sults of Importance to the notional Repub
lican i arty, viz., the continuance of Quay
as a dominant factor in the p:r<\T State
.if Pennsylvania and in national politics,
and the retirement of Colonel Burns,
whose appointment as Senator from a
creat State like California would be most
hurtful to the Republican party."

SORRY THAT
HE FAKED
1 ells Alec Greggains How He
Was Bribed.
Seldom If ever. has a. pugilist who has
thrown his backVrs down by faking In
the ling had any pangs of conscience by
reason of his disreputable act. Charles
Vlckera Is an exception to the rule. He
has unbosomed himself In a private let
ter to Aloe QrcggaJna, one of the man
agers Of the San Francisco Athletic Club.
In it he regretfully tells of his fight with
James Ryan of Montana before the Co
lumbian Athletic Club; how he wa. 1 * led
aside from tho path of square fighting
by promises of reward, and now he
pleads forgiveness for his foolish con
durt.
Vickors and Ryan met before the Co
lombia Athletic Club on the evening of
December 7. and the local fighter made a
raw att< mjÂ»t at feigning defeat. The
fraud whs so palpable that Referee Me
Olnler ordered both men out of the ring
and declared all brts off. Vlckers' ac
tion proved hlÂ» undoing, as ho will never
be matched again by any of the local
clubs. In the following letter from L'Â«a
Angeles he admits his part In the fraud:

match. To toll the truth I <|id not know what
w-as Bring to happen until Just a few minutes
before entering the ring, when a party called
riÂ«Â« to one side and offered me a neat little .sum
If I would do the trick within four rounds and
told me I was up HKainst a hard game anJ
â would be bcatfn anyway. And nwt every one
toM me that. Well, us I expected to be beaton
and I needed the coin. I took the chanc. and
no one Is tnoiv o.rry than I am. Although I
Â»aÂ» a failure at the attempt, neverthi-ie-s I
jrr.t the money. You know. Alec, there are few

much to have put my friends on, but one of *he

Another vessel that is causing groat
uneasiness Is thÂ« schooner American Girl,
which lefi here on October *> last in com
pany with the hark Ferris S. Thompson
for Pugot Sound. The Thompson arrived
at Port Townsend on December 2, and the
captain reported that the day before no
had wen a "bald-headed" three-masted
schooner about 100 miles off Klatteiv
which he took to be the American Girl!
The schooner had only a forestaysAl] set
but she did not then appear to be in dis
tress The general Impression Is that trie
American Girl has lost nearly all her sails
and is trying to get back to the Bound
under short canvas. There is no fear of
the crew running short of provisions as
there was ten tons of supplies in the hold
for Pope & ralbot'i mill at Port Gamble
The American Girl was built at Port
L.udlow in 1875 and is 214 tons net burden
She Is 119 feet 9 inches long 31 feet 4
Inches beam and {â¢ feet 8 Inches draft.

The bark Woollahra, which arrived at
Eureka yesterday. reports passing
through wreckage on December 9 and 10
In latitude 40 degrees 40 min

which some people think Is the remains
of the American Girl. Among the wreck
age was the housetop of a small vessel.
It had bux one scuttle attached. There
were also a number of piles among tne
wreckage, but they were old and had bar
nacles on them.
Captain Murk of tho Ferris s Thomp
son and the Western Union Telegraph
Company are at out* and a lawsuit may
be necessary to settle thi difficulty. Wheii
the Thompson left here in company with
the American CJirl she was under charter
to bring a load of telegraph poles fr.im
the Sound here for the sum of j.?i<i.. When
the bark reached her loading port and
Captain Murk surveyed "tin toad" <>(
he at one. -;ii.l his vessel could
not carry them all. "That is all right."
said the agent; "your price for carrying
the lot is 0000. n..v. you can take all the
ship will carry this trip and come back
for the rest." Captain Murk swore by all
the saints in the calendar that he would
do no such thing, po th<- Thompson

THE TELEPHONE RESOLUTIONS.
01 the majority of the Board of Su
pervisor.* have given proof of a genuine regard
for the public welfare by the enactment of
municipal Irpislation which will be of material benefit
to the community. The passage of the telephone
resolutions yesterday was a distinct victory for the
people against a powerful corporation. Nor was it Â«
barren victory, for it will provide the public treasury
*ith a considerable income by the imposition of a tax
which is in every respect just and equitable.

League was held last evening at thÂ«

Temperance Union on McAllister str^r
Two speakers addressed those present :
Mrs. Charlton Edholm and Rev Mr'
Rowell. The first named made a plea "for
the work of rescuing young girls, and al- '
lepi-d that there Is a f>yÂ»tem by which
thousandti of young girls are entrapped
every month, and *hÂ» i l;Ud the blurm- at
the door of the liquor trade. "Stop the
liquor ir.ift. she said, "and the rescue
of young girls will l>Â»- ea,sy. There are
30rt,0UÂ» young girls annually entrapped bo
cau.-o of the llimor traffic Five millions
of brothers In tin- church Â«.f Jesus Christ
vote for the liquor traffic, and they are
thereby made partners not only In that
tratllc but the responsibility of the down
fall of girls Is upon them." Mrs. IM
holm's manner was very dramatic and
tears : oiled down her cheeks repeatedly
while nhÂ»Â» spoke.
Ray. Mr. Kowell attacked President Me-
Kiuley because, he said, he had not pre
vented the urn of litjuor In the WhitÂ©
House and also had not stopped the car
teen system in the army. Mr. Itowell
aNo paid his attention to Secretary
Root In uncomplimentary terms. He
wondered why the lightning did not
strike McKinley and Root, lie also con
demned the Methodist Hlshop* "who
threw their arms around McKinley." Mr.
Ho well exclaimed that he would rather
rcf the churches dead than to have them
sanction such acts. God could get alomr

C. Alpcrs opened a practical speech with
a reference to thÂ« new all in which the
meeting was held and to the elaborate
manner In which it hud been decorated by
the ladies.
"We ought not to meet any opposition
toward improving our city." ho said, "and
I cannot think that the objections are
made seriously. No one should object to
borrowing money from the future to ap
ply to the present. It is a good business
proposition and we of Sunnyside should
certainly do all we can to improve and
attract attention to our city. We have
Â«nÂ£T lous Park ; . but it beslna nowhere
arid haa no road leading to it worthy of
the name, . i he burden of the cost will

i la that it meets with the hearty support
| of our Mayor, in whom we ail have con
fidence. Y\ c must shake off our lethargy
! mvs i t waagss? tf possibie ' but we
P. N. Wellln argued that it is just as
necessary to procure proper parks a* to
procure sewers and schools and a proper
j hospital, "On an averaj he . u ,i â -Â,
RSfMbS? ? * money that Is spent on a
building is for adornment. A city should
aim t.Â» ninke itself beautiful, and only by
this manner can we brim; to our m!.l~t
those people â¢:." want to spend money
and whose money we want to get. Th.Â»
calamity howlers are raising the point
that the panhandle extension will be bo
very expensive that wo shall be reduced
to Poverty It will cost you just C 3 cents
lon e\ery $10<i worth ot property. I wish
! here to correct .Mr. Barry, who In his
; raper | ust Saturday said the freeholders
: who made the new charter were opposed
,to the panhandle. The truth 1- that at
â  the headquarters of the bond promoters
| to-day twelve out of the fifteen freehold
ers announced that they are flrmiy in
favor of the panhandle extension bonds.
1 think Mr. Harry is one of the u-.- 1 cJU
zens of San Francisco, but In this in
stance somebody haÂ» certainly led him
down a wrong path."
Mayor I'h.-lan congratulated the large
audience on the Interest it showed in
public improvements, and sal.] that in this
campaign he had noticed that the people
In the suburbs wen apparently far more
in earnest than the people in the heart of
the city.
As soon as th.- Mayor had opened his
t speech six young ladles dressed In white
, one bearing an elegant bouquet, marched
jon to the platform and presented the
flowers to the Mayor, while little Miss
L.thel North delivered the following neat
ppeech:
"Your Honorâ Wa, thÂ« children of the
Sunnyside Bchool. present you with this
bouquet of Sunnyside flowers in recogni
tion of the noble efforts you have made
1 to get us a nrhool building in our district
j suitable to our \rant* and 111 for your
; effort in '-, hJf of other districts equally
, as badly off. And Â«â¢â  would say to you,
sir. press on in the nath you have marked
out lor yourself and there will be no such
word a> fall."

bouquet. tJie Mayor v. -ry gracefully ac
knowledged the gift and the kind words

Alva Hotem and Mary Stammer.
The Mayor piled to all the objections
that have been raised and showed that It
Is folly to raise a cry of class, or of tec
i tlonallEm. or of useless adornment or to
' say that because our father* did nr>t need
a panhandle, therefore the present and
succeeding generations shall not have it.
"Give this improvement to ourselves and
to our city as a Christmas present." said
the Mayor "Let us not be mean and nar
row minded. l>ut let us do what I? so
plainly our duty."
Speeches were also made by Etapenrlaor

and spoke on the importance of every
man voting in favor of the Issuing of
bonds to Improve the city. With these few
remarks he Introduced Thomas E. Â«'urran
as chairman of the evening.
Mr. Curran opened with a short address
in which he dwelt on the necessity of rot-
Ing for all of the Improvements coming
before the people â  within the next few
days, and went further by stating that
the time will not be far distant when Ber
nal Heights will be acquired by the city
for a public park.
Among the speakers who aroused the
enthusiasm of the meeting were Judge P.
W. Van Rrynegom and John T. Graham,
both of whom explained the gnat bene
fits to the i â â â  i â '. not only â â¢; the Mission
district but of the entire city in the exten
sion ot the handle, the school build
ings, sewers and a modern city hospital.
C. A. Swelgaft in an eloquent address
pictured the beauties of a city with parka
and boulevards. San Francisco should
and will be one of tho.se cities spoken of
by all visit. ii. when the citizens under the
new charter adorn Its surroundings and
make it attractive. John 11. Qrady, A.
W. Thompson and other speakers in
dorsed all that had been advanced by
those who had stepped to the front to lift
San Francisco from Its villagellke ap
pearance into a gnat and prosperous
municipality, with a spirited and pro
gressive class of inhabitants.
The meeting all through was declared a
decided success and one in favor of prog
ress nd Improvements.
THE FANHAiNDLE

of bonds for the Panhandle extension
net in the .Mills building yesterday after
noon and organized for a brief campulgn.

draw.
The following resolution was passed:

nounced the following:
'Finance Popper, L. AJtschul, Jos

Literatureâ Dr. Taylor, J. H. Barry,
Horace Davis, J. H. Marble,
After much discussion it was decided
that the time is too short to permit of a
campaign of meetings and that the only
feasible plan Is to Issue a circular and
place one in the hands of every voter.
The literary committee was given full
power to act and the finance committ* â¢â¢
promised to supply all the necessary
funds.
i: P. E. Troy strongly criticized thÂ«
speech made at Sunday's debate by
Mayor Phelan "The Mayor is plainly
committed to a subversion and evasion of
the new chattel and I deeply regret it."
James H. Bnrr; expressed the same opin
ion, saying that under the. charter the
matter would BrÂ«1 have to be submitted
to the people and it is this feature that
Mr. Phelan is now engaged in attempting
to defeat.

said that the zrnde of the four blocks In

RESTORATION OF GRAIN
RATES FROM OGDEN WEST
SOUTHERN PACIFIC GETS BACK
TO THE $4 MARK.
Relaxation of Business Activity
Throughout the E i=t Causes a
Fall in Firight Charges on
Westbound Business.
The T'tah Krain rato has been restored
to its uripinal flffure i>v the Boutharn Pa
cific Company, tliÂ»> changa becoming ef
â  â¢ y. stcrday.
The original rate was |1 per ton from
Ogden west, A short time ago this was
Increased to $7 10, the reason given by the
Southern Pacific being that owing to the
tremendous Increase of traffic consequent
on the conditions of trade brought about
by the recent war, particularly the
volume of business being donÂ« by carriers
In connection with the transportation of
troops to the Philippines, It was Impos
sible to supply cars In sufficient numbers
to at one*' take earn of the Increased
traffic and the Utah grain business at
th" same time, and therefore It became
necessary for the company, working: on
good commercial principles, to put in a
rate m high m to practically act an a
prohibitive tariff.
This, while It worked hardship to the
farmers of the Malad and Cache valleys
in Utah by practically preventing them
from getting any of their crops to market
on the Pacific Coast, fathered the ends of
the Southern Pacific by affording thai
company greater facilities for handling
more remunerative freight.
The Oregon Short Lino and the Texas

COMPLETE THE CANAL
OR DREDGE HARBOR
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
MM Broadway, Dec. 18.
Efforts will be made at the present ses
sion of Congress to get Oakland harbor
matters settled, and there la a great deal
of recommending going on from both
Oakland and Alameda. The city of Ala
meda wants the tidal canal finished, and
there are effort* being made In Oak
land to have the western end of the
estuary dredged before the tidal canal Is
completed. Congressman Metcalf has
written to Oakland to say that the whole
matter has been referred to General John
M. Wilson, chief of the engineers of the
War Department, and that an answer
will be received from him during the
present week.
The main point at Issue Is the object
for which the present appropriation shall
be used. There Is still some money to be
used, and certain part want that >
money to bo Uaed In the construction of !
the tidal canal, while others desire thru |
it be expended upon the dredging of the
western end of the estuary. Congressman
Mi toalf writes as follows upon that
point:
E. W. Marston, President Oakland Board
of Trail*â Sir: 1 kiu In receipt of
yours of til* 4th In^U. Inclosing copy of rÂ«nv
lutlons forwarded by the Board Of Trad* to
the honorable Secretary of War in relation
to the Oakland harbor Improvement! In
answer I would say that on the '.'th tnÂ«t.
Senator Pt-rklns and myself called upon
Brlgndler Oeneral John M Wilson, chief
of engineer*, und took up the matter with
him of tho Oakland harbor Improvement.
It was the opinion of tÂ»*nfral Wilson and
of Colonel McKcnzte that bo portion of the
fund Dow available could be used for the
purpose of dredxlnjc a channel easterly from
the Webster-street 1 lids* to the mouth of
the tidal 'anal Â»iÂ»-n<Tal Wilson, however,
salJ that he would give his opinion In .writ-
Ins.
1 have addressed him In writing on thÂ«
subject and have alxo asked thai he rive
me an opinion or ruling upon the resolu
tions of the Hoar.! of Trail-. If no >>ortlon
of the fund i'm be used for this purpose
tin n we want to get an appropriation from
ConÃrÂ«-=s.
It is Important that these questions be
settled without delay, and I have urged
General Wilson to Â»rlve a prompt answer to
my communication. Very respectfully.

It would seem that the opinion In held
In Washington that the tidal canal should
be completed before any further work Is
done, on the Oakland end.

very likely that if the company were fully

VIII. FRANZ HAXS.
BY FRANK VOWLBR
Every great advance in science seems a
port of crystallization of forces which the
previous centuries have hold latent, wait
ing, as It were, for the right moment and
the right man. This appears peculiarly
the case with Dutch painting and the
Dutch painter who Is the subject of this
sketch.
About 200 years before the arrival of
Franz Hals upon the scene, the brothers
Jan and Hubert Van Eyck had released
from Its fetters the art of painting by
placing In the hands of artists the facile
vehicle of oil to be used In the mixing of
pigments. The masterpiece* produced
before this time that have come down
to us were painted in fresco or In dis
temper. Fresco painting, as the word
Implies, meaning "fresh," was the prac
tice of painting on fresh planter, using
water as the medium for mixing the
colors. This obliged the artist to work
very rapidly, besides limiting to â  com
paratively narrow range his choice of
tints. Consequently no great depth of
tone could be secured and anything like
â  realistic Â« eot of nature was by this
means quite out of the question. The
very sobriety of color Imposed by these
restriction*, however, aided In a way the
class of art then called for, 1. c.. religious
painting. Dignified and Imposing sub
jects on a monumental scale for public
buildings and churches could thus be
presented with all the realism demanded
by their function as accessory to archi-
tectural embellishment. But when It be- (
came desirable to produce works destined I
for a different purposeâ pictures that
might be easily portableâ portraits of in
dividual* for the adornment of the '
home, and Illustrations of themes for the |
personal gratification and pleasure they
may giveâ a new method was wanted, '
one capable of recording the wider range
of physical facts which now revealed
themselves to the observation and scru
tiny of the artist. With Increased ac
quaintance on the part of the painter
of visual effects In the world about him
came a like advance In the means of re
cording them, and we find that painting |
In distemper came Into practice. This
called for the employment of glue and the ;
yolk of egg In the mixing of colors, and
pigments thus prepared could be used
over dry walls and wood and canvas.
This was not, however. Its only recom
mendation; it permitted the employment
Of a greater number of . tints, greater
depths of effects of light and shade to be
attained, and gave to the artist a wider
scope In force and brilliancy of color.
This larger liberty extended also to the
character of the themes depleted, and
art began to Include In Its repertory of
subjects scenes from contemporary 1 1 â¦â¢
as well as those from biblical story.
Art. In a word, became more human,
although it was still retained in the
service of the church. Hut with the
broadening of the Held It now entered
science, and observations and discovery
were still advancing, and the Influences
of the outside world were strengthening I
the painter's physical as well as mental
vision. Homely and familiar themes,
homely and familiar emotions, claimed
Illustration at his hands, and with these
claims a still more convenient and ready
means of expressing them was required.
When the Van Eycks discovered, th.
this satisfactory and effective method of
using pigments with oil a new world of j
poslbllltles was opened to the painter, j
and It was like a revelation to the lover I
of painting aa well, for effects in nature
that were probably discerned and appre- :
elated by many before art could render |
them became now legitimate material for
graphic portrayal. An exquisite variety
of colorâ subtle or dramatic renditions of
light and shade, fine differentiations of
ttuctures, the resonance of metal, the rus- I
tle of silk, the shimmer of satin, the Hash
of diamonds, the glimmer of pearls: In j
fact, all the characteristics of the vege- I
table, animal or mineral kingdom that by
appeal to the eye reveal Its density or |
lightness. Its texture or colorâ now be- j
came the property of the painter, a store- i
house from which he drew the materials
of his art. The Van Eycks by freeing
painting of its technical restrictions led
up to this. This then was the momont
when Dutch art became emancipated,
and Franz Hals was the man who eman
cipated It.
I think, for such a destiny, biography
has seemed strangely unfair to this man.
Born at Antwerp, and not at Mechlin, os
some writers say. little appears regarding
his apprenticeship 10 his art other than
i that he Is supposed to have studied with
! Van Manner. Of a social and genial dis
| position, great stress has been laid upon
his fondness for the pleasures of the tav
ern, his improvidence and his too fre
quent lapses from sobriety. Yet he. in re
corded as belonging to several of the hon
orable guilds of the town, and a pension
was awarded him by the city. He lived
to the ripe age of 84. In addition to this
respectable record he has enriched the
world by some of the most masterly can
vases It has Inherited from any hand.
Now It was in Franz Hals, a* I have
jald, that this crystallization culminated,
'or ho thus marked, as It were, tcchnl
?al!y. the cumulative point In Dutch
?aintlngr. Rembrandt, bis Immediate euc
cesaor. Indeed In a degree his contempo
rary, although more than twenty years
his Junior, represented the full flower of
Dutch genius. Hut Hals had cleared much
ground before Rembrandt began to paint.
Before that time, and since the Van
Eycks, Dutch nrt had not made great
progress. It had. however, been prepar
ing the wiy for thr right man to take Jp
this Improved Instrument of nil painting
and to wlel I It right valiantly. This Frana
Hals did. He practically left the flelit
of religious art, took up contemporary
life and depicted Its scenes and feelings.
Hals was almost the ilrst masttr of the
"laugh"' In pSlntlng. Hlti Jovial n.iturÂ«
made this portrayal of mirth on the hu
man countenance almost Infectious. Ills
â¢Tien': freedom of touch gave much
readiness In blocking In those facial mus
cles which come into play when the feat
ures are relaxed by this emotion and his
people re.illy laugh when he wishes them
to do so. It Is no galvanized and sterÂ«o
typed expression which he frives usâ wo
feel that the muscles are moblie and that
without effort they will resume their nor
mal calmness. Then, too, this painter had
a distinguished sense of tone and colorâ
his method is modern In Its frankness a.id
truth of relative values In light and Â«hide.
He paints opposing planet with a sturdy
Intention. There Is corporeity and vol
ume in hi* parsonagesâ they are flesh and
blood.
As the call for rtUgiooM painting became
less the demand for the Interpretation of
national traits Increased, and Hals wit
FRANZ HALS.
In a measure, the father Â» . the nrt r.f
genre painting. Fisher boy*, old house
wives, topers and rollicking burchers
lived on his canvases, and he was capa
ble of perpetuating the honorable mem
bers of civic guilds with a good taste ar4
Judgment that have resulted In some of
the most notable works of portraiture. In
this field of painting he antedated Rem
brandt, and Rembrandt himself In th#s*Â»
same subjects or others kindred to them
produced canvases that are the glory of
Dutch art. How can It 'â¢ saitl. then, that
this man was a worthless fellow? Much
misapprehension and lock of appreciation
have followed Hals, but there are now,
and have been for a number of years past,
evidences that he Is coming Into his own.
It Is sometimes difficult to tell Just why
one painter Is longer than another in re
ceiving recognition. in the case of Hals,
however, it may be attributed to the ex
treme modernity of the artist's method*.
Frank and direct in hla vision and pos
secslng a facility 00 astounding. Hals In
.i great measure painted to please himself,
and often his canvases do not permit of
the close inspection that his contempora
ries had been accustomed to regard as a
test of the perfection of workmanship.
Receiving vivid Impressions from nature,
and not so Imaginative as Rembrandt, ho
pointed wtth an Itnpttuusity at times
which forgot everything that conventional
painting respected. Ho could none tho
less give his portraits a great care ami
completeness when he wished to carry
them farther than a robust sketch, Hut
his skill was so grrat that he would very
often take a painter's pleasure out of hi*
work and leave it. expressive to himself
but less satisfactory to those who hail
nuver *een In art the world thus Imaged.

A large number of the mills In South"CHRISTIAN" IN STAGE GARB.
0 Monday evening the dramatization of Hall Calne's masterpiece,
"The Christian." will be- Feen at the Columbia Theater. No book
cf recent years has provoked more criticism than this very fin de
riocle novel, and the play has '-Id the same position toward the
r>laygoing public as thÂ« book has toward the lovers of human
problems In the dross of modern fiction.
The play differs somewhat from the book-story, bat only to the extent
necÂ»*ssary to raÂ«t dramatic requirements. Glory Quayle appears as repre
p rated in the book. In the story John Storm is a controversial character, a
personage whose somber attributes a? described by the author present him in
th<Â» light of a religious fanatic In th* play Mr. Cain* relieved the stage John
Storm of his pronounced religious characteristics, and presents him as a
noMe. self-sacrificing man, the love existing between Glory Qnayle and him
forming the central motive of the dramatic story.
"The Christian" is presented In â  prologue and four acts. The scene of
the prologue is laid In the tiltlng-ground' In the ruins of Peel Castle, Isle of
Man. brightened by .... atmosphere of that quaint tittle Manx
Island. The tlrst act of the play takes place in the saloon of the i 'nil'.
i-eum Music Hall In London, where Glory Quayle ha.* made her debut as a
Muger; the second In the clubroom of St. Mary Magdalene's Church. Soho.
where John Storm has become I worker In the slums of the East End of
London; the third in Glory's apartments In the garden house, Clement's Inn,
London, and the fourth in the clubroom of John Storm's church.
The company that is to produce "The Christian" is one of unusual ex
cellence*. Effle Elsler will be seen as Glory Quayle and James Colvllle as
John Storm. Others In the cast will include Frank Wecton and Fanchon
Campbell.
HASTINGS HAS A
WARM WELCOME
AT THE ALCAZAR
Warde Appears Again
in " Virginius."
>
HOT COONS AT CALIFORNIA
Â«
"Dr. Hill" was the bill and Ernest
Hastings the drawing card at the AJca
rar laM night. The play was not the hap
piest selection as a reception ceremony,
but Hastings was welcome In spite of It
and met with something of an ovation.
He maJe a speech, which goes without
Baying, and fhowed therein a gentleness
and sincerity that are not conspicuous
virtues of his acting. If he can appear
well bred In a ppeech why not at oth.T
times'? If when he Is himself hÂ« Is re
fined, why Ik bÂ« not when representing
pome <<nÂ» ol.so?
One would say to â M him act that thrro
was a coarse fiber In the roan, but It was
rot evident last night when he stepped
to thÂ« footlights and thanked the au
dlonew for Us cordiality. As Dr. Hill he
is the samp easy, colloquial person ho has
ever been In Alcazar farces. I'lays of the
kind do not seem to tempt him to char
acter work, which Is always an essential
feature >if these plays In the original. I
ray original, for most of the farces at the
Alcazar have been adaptations from the
French, nnd "Dr. Hill" Is not an excep
tion to the rulÂ«. Just how distant the
adaptation is from the real thing is hard
to say. but this much is evidentâ the
Frenchy-Frenehy quality is entirely ab-
FÂ«>nt. only with the aid of our Imagina
tion are we able to percrive original mo- .
tlve. which, to say the least. Is not In
accord with our notions of dramatic pro
priety. It Is chiefly the falaclousness of
these farces that elves them an ephÂ«*m
c-ral vogue in Parts, and there is qul'<Â»
n band of authors over thereâ Itlrson.
Carre. Â«*t al.. who vi<* with one another to
devise some new and nocuous situation
nhout which they may build a cheap and
frothy comedy.
The English \errlon, which is the mis
directed fffort <>f a clover man. Hamilton
Aid*, is innocent enough, but there are
nccnrs and situations that suggest an
original thnt should make "the Turtle"
I.Me Its head and its tall as well.
Halting* is Hastings, which is all that
cm bo snid of him. except that be kisses
his way from curtain to curtain with
characteristic relish. Laura Â«'rews. who
came in for n share of the reception, had
too lit tl<* to do. but she- wan clever in her
peculiarly nice way. Marie Howe and
Frank < ipporm.m are cut from the same
piece and en through their parts with
throttle* wide open. Oeorge Webster,
who sometimes Imitates a bad actor, did
creditable work rÂ«s Mr. Horton. inspector
of police, but Frank Denithome was as

Grand Opera-House.
The revival after nearly a decade of
Strauss' pretty waltz opera, "I Mo Fleder
maus" ("The Bat*/)] proved very success
ful at the Grand Opera-house. The pre
sentation was excellent, and lMith Mason
i held her usual prominent part and ren
| dor. d her songs as Roslland delightfully.
j Hattie Holl Ladd was good as Adele and
Ethel Strachan acquitted herself admira-
I bly as Ida. PerseÂ«? as the married -cape
goat Elsensteln carried his pan to its
i limit, and Bessie Fnirbairn evidenced her
versatility as the IMnce. William Wolff

sees the many separated lovers reconciled
and happy. Judging from the crowd at

California.
"The Hottest Coon in Dixie" opened the
week successfully at the California on
i Sunday and did equally well last night
so far as the box receipts were concerned,
but there was a lamentable lack of im
provement in the female voices and the
concerted Kinging. However, the fun was
fast and furious. Will Proctor, Rob Kelly
and Fred Carey putting up an excellent
performance that more than made up for
the shortcomings of the musical features
,of the programme. The play will be con
tinued during the remainder of the week.
Columbia.
"Vlrginius," with Frederick Warde In
the title role, was the attraction at the
Columbia last evening. There was a fair
attendance and those only were the losers
who were not among those present. Mr.
Warde was of course the central figure of I
the play and his acting was fully up to
expectations. He was repeatedly called
before the curtain at the end of every act
und scene to bow his thanks for the ap
proval of the audience, and at the close
of the fourth act the house would not
rest content until he had advanced to the
footlights and spoken directly to them.
Mr. and Mrs. Clarence M. Bruno, as Icil
lus and Virginia, also came In for a gen- 1
Â«tous share of the applause and were
several times compelled to come back to
make their acknowledgments. To-night
"The Merchant of Venice" will be pre

The teachers in the -public schools may

tlement can be effected with the State

Treasurer Truman agreed to pay the
teachers, after a consultation with Audi

Board of Education, he has mode the dis
covery that there will be no funds avail
able for the purpose until January 5, when
the salaries are legally due.
There is now in the city treasury teach
era 1 demands for the month of November
amounting to 196,000, which have been paid
und are carried along as rash until such
time as the taxes that have been paid
may be apportioned to the salary fund.
The High School fund is overdrawn Iti

GOT THEIR FURNITURE BUT NO LICENSE.
OAKLAND, Dec. 18.â A young couple from th*Â« salt fields of Mount Eden
appeared at the County Cleric's office to-day looking for a marriage license.
They gave the names of William Osterloh and Annie Chrlstenscn. and they
suggested that they were In a hurry for the license, for they wanted to get
married and hurry back to Mount Eden on the afternoon train to go to
housekeeping.
It was quite evident that this latter statement wan true, for the couple
were loaded down with packages that were preparatory to housekeeping.
Besides the usual household goods of the cuisine and dining room type, there
was a baby's high chair and a baby carriage.
.They deposited their good* In one corner of the County Clerk's office
and then spent half an hour trying to persuade Deputy County Clerk Brown-
Ing that even if the young lady was only 17 It would be all right to
. Issue the license. They had come all the way from Mount Eden, made their
housekeeping purchases, and It was a decided shock to them to find that
' they could not' get the license. They were- forced to return home with their
household goods, but not the license.

NUSBAUMER AND
McELRATH PASS
THE LIE DIRECT
Excitement at the For
mer's Deposition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. is.
The taking of Attorney Kmll Nus
baumer's deposition thia afternoon in the
Hult brought against him by R. F. Simp
lon for an accounting ended in an â¢
ing MOM; the lie wo* passed freely, and
but for the timely Interference oi Mr.
Nujl'aumpr's attorney*.. Messrs. K. M
Fitagerald, George W. Keed and ex-Judge
Frlck, Mows would have been â truck. In
fact. Nusbaumer arose to strike plaln
tiff'H attorney, Major J. K. McElrath, f<Â»r
culling him a liar, and the major apt
i ready to dt fend himself with his
fists.
The deposition was taken in the offices
of Court Â»'ommlssioner Batx-oek. who pre-
Bided as Judge for the occasion. R. F.
Simpson was also present.
Sim[iKin wanted NusliHumcr's deposition
taken, for it Is now the fashion in take
depositions in Oakland, and this afternoon
Mt. NusbaumaT told his story, largely a
repetition of his adswer, until it came to
the scene between himself and Attorney
M.-Klinth.
"1 was employed by Simpson's attor
neys, llessrs. A. A. Moore and J. C. Mnr
tin." deposed Mr. Nusbaumer, "to ascer
tain the lowest figure that the
li'-n holders would take, ami tiiat em
ployment was with Simpsons consent, I
interviewed mosi of thÂ« lien holders, with
the exception of Niehaus Bros., and re
the result of my work ti. Attor
neys Moore and Martin, i took a state
ment of what the lien holders agreed to.
No, I haven't th.it paper now. and to the
best of my recollection I turned it over to
E. P. Cole, tlÂ»Â«- attorney for Macdonough.
I never interviewed Macdonough. I
showed Simpson these stated agreements
to settle.
"I interviewed Attorney Cole three
times. On the second occasion 1 went to
him with the names of thuse who agreed
t" settle, and the last time I went then
to obtain such checks as were coming to
Simpson. wlu.sÂ« claim against M.icdon
ough had been consist re,] by Simpson nnd
his attorneys, Martin A Moore and Mac
donough's attorneys, Cole & Bennon. The
price agreed on for a compromise was*
I
"Simpson had refused the $19,000 rompro.
raise offer until he could ascertain at what
figure he could settle with his own cred
itors, and that question depended upon
the suit of Niehaus Brothers. The ques
tion of the final compromise was effected
by Simpson and his attorneys. I repeal
1 did not compromise that suit of Slmp.-m
Macdonough."
Major McElrath here showed witness a
1. -ter signed by the latter and dated
August a, UM, wherein Mr. Nusbaomer
certified that in February. i*Â»w, he acting
as attorney for Stmpson in the litigation
against Macdonough, had received as mm
pensatlon WO. The signature wu.s ac.
knowledged. hut still Nusl.aumer insisted
he had not effected the compromise.
"In February, IS9H." he continued ' I
went to Cole to get the Macdonough checks
for Simpson. Simpson was present, hut
not in the room. f<>r I understood Mac
donougn would be there, an ,i knowing
Simpson to be a man of violent temper
he cant control himselfâ l expected trou
ble, and advised Simpson to remain out
side. After the conference we went down
and cracked a bottle of wine. Sam Bell
wife have been living In the house of
Reinike at Elmhurst, and the recent
matrimonial dissolutions and re-en
gagements seem mutually satisfac
tory to all concerned.
This is the way Greaves explains his
matrimonial troubles and his new al
liance with a girl less than half his
age:
"I got a divorce from my wife on
the ground of desertion. She first
tried to get a divorce from me, but
failed, and I then commenced pro
ceedings. My ex-wife and ' I have
been living with Mr. Reinike and his
daughter for several years. My wife
and I were not happy, though she and
Mr. Relnike seemed to get along well
together. Finally I decided to marry
Miss Reinike if possible. You all know
I have succeeded."
IfcKee was there, but I don't know where
he came from.
"A few days later I gave Blmpson his
two checks. I had carried out the details
of the compromise. I am absolutely cer
tain Attorneys Moore. Martin and Chap
man got the offer of Macdonough to com
promise for $19,000. i remember that be
cause Mr. Simpson once came to my of
flee and said it was for 520J060 or more,
and I told him he was a liar to his teeth.
Simpson will remember that. E. P. Cole.
Macdonough's attorney, is dead, and 1
have ascertained from his dally Journal
two entries. One, on February 17, 1593,
reads: 'After Fix interviews with Bennon,
offered to settle with Simpson for $19,000';
the other. February 19, IV.<3, reads: 'Set
tled and dismiss. Simpson versus Mac
donough, basis of $19,0ij0.' John J. S. â â¢â 
non, who up to his death was Macdon
ough's agent, informed me that he had
destroyed all of Macdonough's papers of
date prior to December, 1894, when he
turned his business over to fata i*ttT censor.
The $3000 check which Simpson claims
Nusbaumer manipulated the latter proved
beyond all doubt had been cashed by
Simpson himself with DalseU & Moller.
The hitter's check book was here Intro
duced to prove this. It plso proved a
great surprise to Simpson and his attor
r.ev. It showed an entry of a changed
check for $3000. on which Dalzell & Mol
ler had given him back a check for
$1116 *Â»" which he (Simpson) himself had
Indorsed, and the balance. $ISS3 20, was
placed to his credit on his bill.
"I would like to say that the contract
Simpson had with Macdonough was $31.
000. " continued Nusbaumer. "but he re
ceived in all a total of $15,000 over his
contract tor extras. It simply shows he
did not lose any money on the proposi
tion."
Coming down to the question of whether
Simpson had not been trying to secure
from Nusbaumer an accounting the latter
answered tersely: "Yes; he has been try-
Ing, but 1 never owed him one. I have
never been the keeper of his money nor
his trustee nor agent. 1 think, though,
I have told him to call at my office lor
an accountingâ that is, I made an ap
pointment with him to co with him to
San Francisco and dig up th!* matter ?nd
show him where his money went to and
to see his attorney over there, who, by
the way, is a respectable and perfect gen
tleman and who would have nothing to do
with this cape." :
This was the straw that burned too 'â rip-
Idly for plaintiff's attorney.
"I Infer lrom that." remarked Attorney
Major McElrath. "that you say that any
attorney who would bring this present
suit Is hot a respectable gentleman?"
"Yes, -sir," quickly responded Nusbaum
er, "that Is what I m"an to say."
"Then." retorted the major, rising from
his chair, "you are a liar."
In an instant Nusbaumer was on his
feet and raising: his hand to deliver a
blow when Attorneys Prick and Fitzger
ald stayed It.
"I will not permit two big stiffs like ycu
fellows to come in here and bluff me."
shouted Nusbaumer, speaking to plaintiff
and his attorney.
When quiet was restored the major
apologized to the Court Commissioner, as
did also Nusbaumer, and again for a, mo
ment it appeared as though hostilities
would be renewed, because the two attor
neys claimed there was no need for their
apologizing to each other.
The taking of the depositions will be re
sumed next Wednesday morning.

STAYING OUT AT
NIGHT NO GROUND
FOR A DIVORCE
Luella M. Dailey Is
Denied a Decree.
Oakland Office San Francis>oo Call.
908 Broadway. DÂ»-
That a wife does not necessarily possess
the privilege of Inquiring Into the where
abouts of her husband when he sees fit
to roam about of night* wan virtually de
cided by Superior Judge O*?den this after
noon in the divorce suit of Mrs. Luella M
Dalley against Edward C. Dailey. It Is
Intimated that It Is not unlikely that
henceforth an action to enjoin inquisitive
wives" from delivering curtain lectures and
unceremoniously interfering with their
husbands' habits of staying out late of
nights may be quite the proper thing.
Mrs. Dailey sought a divorce from her
husband, who Is agent for an Eastern
wholesale rubber house, on the ground of
extreme cruelty. In her complaint she
alleged that the cruelty consisted chiefly
of incompatibility of temper and his In
veterate habit of staying away from home
till late. On the witness stand this after
noon Mrs. Dailey, who Is a comely bru
nette of 38 years, reiterated her story of
her husband's cruelty. Miss Cone, her
sister, who was formerly Dalley'i Â»ten
ographer. also testified that a queer
change came over her brother-in-law last
June, and that prior to that time he had
been a model husband.
Dailey did not appear In court, but was
represented by Attorney C. F. Humphrey,
who made no objection to any of the tes
timony or proceeding's. It appeared that
the parties were quite agreed that a de
cree of divorce should be grunted. Judge
Ogden, however, felt otherwise about it.
His Honor declared that no good ground
for a divorce had been established, and
that as to husbands' habits of staying out
late at night and where they hold forth,
that is a burden that wives will have to
suffer. The court accordingly denied a
decree of divorce, but granted the plain
tiff's prayer for $65 monthly alimony out '
of her husband's monthly salary of $250.
In the Alameda divorce suit of Matilda '
Munro against James Munro the defend
ant was to-day cited to appear before Su
perior Judge Ellsworth on December 2<J
to show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt of court In refusing to I
obey the court's order requiring him to
pay $100 50 as alimony, counsel fees and
costs made on November 11, 1999.
William J. Latlmer has failed to appear

What has befn done with the vaat con
IHE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 19, ,1899.
tril.uUons. to this fund no one knows but '
now. when it should amount to STiO.WO. It
is less than $GoOO. and even against this
paltry sum a legal claim of <"â¢-â¢ has boen
made apparently without warrant. At
torneys for the Fire Department are
neither 111 nor objects of charity and what
claim they may have against the char
itable and sick fund It Is difficult to guess.
A brief outline of the history of the
fund will show very clearly the reason
why scandal Is now clinging to Its affairs.
It was organized over twenty years ago
by the flremen themselves. The Fire Com
miss oners have nothing to do with It
! and It Is ostensibly for the sole purposes
Indicated in its name. Disbursement of
the money Is supposed to be exclusively
under the control of officers elected by the
Bremen. For nearly a quarter of a cen
tury the flr-nv.n of San Francisco have
levied a monthly tax upon themselves to
protect themselves from want In the con
tingency of sickness. This monthly tax
has been $1 on every man In the depart
ment.
It is thus evident that an enormous sum
of money has been paid Into the treasury.
\\ hero much of It has cone since Is a
mystery- Some of it has be<Â»n spent to
erect monuments for .Lad firemen but
under what authority no one < an' toll.
Some of It has cone Into the maw of at
torneys, but why no one knows. Much of
it 1 has disappeared in different directions,
and the cheated llrrmen found it discreet
jto keep their mouths shut Scandals have
! arisen but have been suppressed. Suits
i have been threatened, but compromises
< have been forced. The extramen did not
I dare to interfere with the men who con
trolled the affairs of the department.
And now the scheme is to close the af
fairs of the fund with the same secrecy
that for over twenty years marked its
administration. A week ago the district
engineers received their instructions to
advise the tir'-nien what to do. They in
turn held perfunctory conferences with
the extra men. and a committee was ap
pointed to determine what the llnal dispo
sition of the fund shall be. This commit
! tee is still at work and has determined
S nothing. A suggestion has been made
I that the charitable and sick fund be
; transformed into an endowment fund,
such as is In operation in the Police De
partment. The remnant of the vast reve
â  nues of the charitable and sick fund, un
i der this arrangement, would serve as the
i beginning of the endowment fund, the
| monthly tax to continue as before.
It should not be forgotten that while
the Bremen have cared for their sick find
their poor, they have also looked after
their dead. For every death among their
number they have taxed themselves each
$1. but only $:'>' of the sum thus raised
has been given to the relatives of the
dead. What becomes of the rest no one
seems to know. No excuse, therefore, can
be given for encroaching on the sick fund.
There is a disposition to demand an ac
counting to learn why a fund that, it is
I estimated, should be at least $50,000 Is now
1 about Â£5000 net. Hut as the firemen value
their positions and fear their superiors
they dare not act. It is possible, the.re
for.-. that the trail of dishonesty through
the years will be destroyed with the
death of the old department and the or
ganization of the new.

FRENNA GRANTED
HIS LIBERTY BY
TWELVE JURORS
Turner's Slayer Found
Not Guilty.
CLERK DELAYED THE VERDICT
OSCAR TOLLE FAILED TO RE-
TURN TO HIS DUTIES,
Joseph P. Frenna Is a. free man- â¢ He
was granted his liberty last night. by a
jury In .Judge Cook's court which de
clared him not guilty. j The twelve good
mm and true who rendered the verdict
were:
Jeremiah Geary, H. Hambersrer, Edward
Cameron. L. Houser, H. C. Hinkel, R.
Todt. Charles Evans. T. 11. Dooley, L.
Friedlander, Sol Cahen, J. Currier and
R. L. Anderson.
They were prepared to announce their
verdict at 9:30 o'clock, but Oscar Tolle.
the clerk of the court, failed to material
ize anil the Jurors were compelled to cool
their heolÃ in the jury-room. After wait
ing until 10:45 p. m. Judge Cook be
came tired and appointed Stenog
rapher Frank Drew to act as clerk. The
court obtained the consent of W. S.
Barnes, attorney for the defendant, and
Assistant District Attorney- Saulmann be
fore ho directed the Jury to be brought
Into court. Judge Cook also announced
from the bench that he did not want any
demonstration in the courtroom, no mat
ter how the verdict went, and also di
rected the clerk and ballltt to keep their
eyes open and if they saw any person or
persona making an outburst to bring them
before him and he would deal with them
accordingly. This threat had its de
sired effect and when Foreman of the
Jury Jeremiah Geary announced that
"we the Jury find Joseph P. Frenna not
guilty not a sound was heard.
When the. verdict was announced
Frenna s countenance lighted up with Joy.
and be reached for his attorney's chubby
hand and silently pressed it. Mr. Barnes
then arose and requested that his client
be discharged from the custody of the
Sheriff and Judge Cook made the requi
site order. He also rewarded the Jurors
for their long service by granting them
a year's exemption from jury duty.
As the twelve men left the box their
hands were grasped by Frenna. who fer
vently thanked them for their kindness to
him. As Frenna left the courtroom he
was asked win her he would drink to his
good fortune, and he replied In the nega
tive. He said he would rush to his
mother and announce the joyful tidings.
It was learned afterward that the Jury
agreed on a verdict after taking half a
dozen ballots. At the outset of the bal
loting there were seven for acquittal and
five for conviction. Tho minority were
soon won over, and at the hour of recon
vening they were ready to announce the
result.
Clerk Tolle will receive a severe repri
mand for clogging the wheels of Justice
and prolonging the misery of Frenna.
