GOING, going, gone," with nearly
$6000 in the treasury and not a !
hair turned, is the record of
the auction sale held yesterday !
at the Orpheum of the boxes and seats
to be occupied on the occasion of the
benefit to swell the fund for the recep- \
tion of the homecoming California Vol- j
unteers.
That Is, it is the bare record. The
â¢whole thing would fill a big book if
BG-me one had the power to furnish even
a bare description of the scenes crowd
ed into the hour before and the three
hours taken up in the sale. San Fran
cisco never attempted anything on such
a scale before, but she has set herself
a mark that even such a city will find
it hard to overstep.
For days before the auction the com
mittee of theatrical managers, having
in hand the arrangement of the benefit,
put on its best front; looked large, as is j
the fashion of those who- would induce
others to help them be larger; and, put- j
ting its thumbs into the managerial
vest, said unutterable things, even
though it doubted, about raising $5000
from the benefit.
A man with less imagination than a
clam can picture to himself how the
individual managers felt after the auc
tion was over. They felt that they
were IT. so persistently did the people
pat them on the back for the good work
they had done; and, away down in
their great big hearts, they felt, al
though they blushed to admit it, that
they had done all and more than they
had promised. â¢
Hard as the managers worked every
day since their appointment on the
committee, they worked harder yester
day. They had a sort of skirmish ;
drill at their respective houses to get ;
things In shape to run by themselves, j
in order that they might devote their ;
whole time to the business of the bene-'
fit. Managers Meyerfeld and Morrisey
cast the last cursory eye over the inte
rior of the Orpheum and saw that
everything was in shape; Fred Belasco
got an extra close shave and "Doc"
Leahy patronized the same Figaro for
the latest in Vandykes; "Sammy"
Friedlander made a demi-toilet that j
v. as a wonder and had his hair dressed j
to the dead center. Mark Thall and j
"Jake" Gottlob and Melville Marx j
paid extravagant prices for rare pinks. I
The San Francisco Call.
while Alf Ellinghouse and Sam Mott,
who are always de rigeur, got them
selves up mere so. Harry Morosco. who
has a well-trained pompadour, did not
have to waste much time on prelimin
aries and. consequently, was the first
to pear at the managers' meeting
preliminary, at which they were all put
through their paces by the Tivoli ballet
master.
While the managers were preparing
for the nitric-acid test on the public
pocketbook, the deal people were gath
ering outside in the street, ready to
storm the doors th.- moment the}' show
ed the least sign of giving. The crowd
began assembling as early as 10:30
o'clock. By 11 the gripmen on the
O'Farrell street cars found 'â ' difficult
to navigate their craft through the
sea of summer fashion and millinery,
the women were so thick in the crowd,
despite the lowering frown c-f the morn
ing sky.
As the minutes slowly passed and the
hands on the clock crawled to the ap
point- time for the doers to open, the
street was absolutely blocked. It was
not an Impatient crowd, particularly,
but it took Police Sergeant Shea and
all of his half-dozen assistants to keep
it in bounds.
At last, the managers filed out of the
PRINCIPAL FIGURES
meeting and two to each aisle, they
stationed themselves half-way down,
beneath signs reading, "These Seats
Reserved for Bidders." Policemen were
put on the doors, in addition to the reg
ular corps of doorkeepers, ushers were
placed in readiness for the oncoming
crowd and the signal was given, "Open
the doors!"
An answering yell from the outside
and a rush. Pellmell came millinery
and femininity, sealskins and summer
wraps, crowding past the few men who
had the nerve to mix in such a crush
and going fairly over the heads of
ushers, policemen and onto and beyond
the managers half way down the aisle.
For one short minute the elaborate
plan of management for the auction
seemed to sink out of sight, never to
appear again. It was only for a min
ute, however, an extraordinary and un
looked for minute at that, but the well
laid plan triumphed and bobbed up se
renely, smiling at the steady onpour
of prospective buyers that followed
the first rush.
Every plan made to add to the com
fort of those attending the auction
and everything devised to avoid con
fusion worked as if on wheels. Man
agers, ushers, and policemen were
equal to the occasion, and in less time
than it takes one woman to say good

by to another all were seated for whom
there were seats. The incoming others
were provided with the choicest possi
ble standing-room, until even that was
exhausted, and a still large but dis
appointed crowd of late-comers took
up its stand on the outside to await an j
opportunity later on to sr inside.
The Orpheum seats 2200 people. ..nd
there is comfortable standing-room for
600 or 700 more. You can figure out for |
yourself that there were fully 3000 peo- j
pie in the house by noon. No prettier i
scene than they presented has ever |
been witnessed at any popular gather
ing in the city. This was due undoubt
edly to the fact that a good three
quarters of the crowd was composed of
women. Look which way you would
your eyes rested on parterres of pretty,
I faces banked with summer flowers. The
faces were all smiles, and flashing
orbs above rows of pearly teeth that
made you envy the ripe, red melon that
would tempt them to bite.
It was a dream of fair women one
of those rose gardens of girls you read
about, which once led an anonymous
poet to exclaim:
Cover
Me over
With showers
Of flowers;
Heap
Them deep
My shivering.

, Body above,
For I am dying of love!
Had he been at this auction what' a
pretty accompaniment his poetical
paradox would have been to the
."Going, going, gone!" of the auc
tioneer! The sprinkling of well
dressed men in the audience in all
probability would have shared his
despairing cry.
* It was several minutes past the noon '
hour when the head of the first musi- S
cian poked up from under the stage,
followed quickly -. by a number of*
others, and a general rustle was heard
In the audience, denoting a settling*
down for the promised entertainment. J
Herr Rosner sat himself down to his
organ, washed his hands, and the or-*
chestra plunged into the dreamy music*
of the "Serenade." The ' auction was >
on. *
The overture finished and duly ap-T
plauded the audience had about ten 4
seconds, which it put in with a general *â¦

AT THE ORPHEUM AUCTION.
craning of necks and turning of eyes
in a hunt for the bevy of stage beau
ties promised for close inspection. Not
one was in sight. The shrewd theatrical
managers had planned as wisely in this
as in all other arrangements and had
assembled their. stars on the stage be
yond the gaze of the uninitiate until
such time as they should be sprung,
full panoplied,' into their midst.
A sudden darkening of the house, a
hissing, sputtering sound and a bright
glare of light on the curtain announced
to the audience that the blograph was
in action. A picture of Brigadier Gen
eral Jim Smith, the colonel who led the
boys away and has since earned his
promotion, Was flashed on the scene
and drew forth a burst of yells and
handclappings, the harmony, of . which
was marred by the -sputtering of* the
calcium. A bust of Colonel Duboee was
flashed on the screen and so loudly
cheered that it was flashed on again
to the encore. The wife of the colonel
was in a box to hear the cheers for her
hero.
In quick succession followed spirited
pictures showing deeds on the field of
battle for which California is preparing
such a rousing demonstration for her
returning sons. Part of a regiment of
.New York volunteers was shown
marching from the cars at Tampa to
the transports. Then came one, "What
Our Boys Did in Manila." A Spanish
admiral's* flag flying met the gaze of
the audience. In a moment the head of
an American tar showed as he shinned
up the pole and tore oft the emblem
â of the foe. From his blouse he drew
the Stars and Stripes and. hammer in j
hand, amid the plaudits of the specta
tors, he nailed it to the mast.
Pictures showing the work of the Red j
Cross, were full of action and loudly j
appreciated, the show closing with a
rapid firing charge which showed all
the grim realities of war.
The house lighted -up, a second cur
tain ascended and there on the* stage
was the beauty show. All the adver
tised owners of feminine loveliness,
with the exception of Blanche Bates
and Margaret Anglin, were stretched in
a semicircle, after the manner of a
minstrel first part, Wendell JJHnston, the
official auctioneer, and "W. J. Martin,
chairman of* the citizens' decoration
committee, in the seats of the end men.
Appropriately, In such an aggregation
of loveliness, there were no "bones."
Mrs. John Morrisey, who enjoys the
privilege and distinction of honorary
membership In the Elks, among whom
she is known â¢as â¢ "Our Tillle," was
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
there, as was Mrs. Ernestine Kreling,
proprietress of the Tivoli, always a
prominent figure where funds are to
be raised. Edna Wallace Hopper,
petite and pretty in white, with the
perfume of the new mown hay of her
Livermore ranch clinging about her;
Miss Juliet Crosby, who in private life
is the wife of Fred Belasco of the. Alca
zar; Miss Marie Howe and Elspeth Mc-
Neill of the same theater; Miss Esther
Jacobs, a concert singer from New
York, who will soon appear in public:
Junoesque Mary Van Buren of the
Frawley Company; Delia Stacey, Mary
Linck, Hattie Belle Ladd, Helen Henry.
Irene Everett and Beth Franklynâall
were there.
As head of the finance committee M.
H. de toung was on the stage, ex
changing bon mots with several pretty
affidavit-takers to the efficacy of this
and that dentifrice. Mayor Phelan, his
secretary. Colonel William P. Sullivan
Jr., and J. J. Gottlob and S. H. Fried
lander were there and Henry E. Mo-
Pike, who, besides being the secretary
of the executive committee, is one of
the attorneys for Mrs. Langtry.
Manager Gottlob started the speech
making. He thanked* the people for the
turnout they had made in response to
the. invitation of the managers and he
appealed to their patriotism to make
the benefit a success by digging deep
into their pockets. He then introduced
Mayor Phelan, who was greeted with
cheers.
"Members of the Executive Commit
tee, Ladies of the Profession and La
dies and Gentlemen," said his Honor,
"I desire on behalf of the executive
committee, which was formed for the
purpose of welcoming our California
Volunteers and all other volunteers to
this city, to thank the gentlemen who
represent the theatrical profession of
this city and the artists who appear on
the boards, who have generously con
tributed their services to make the re
ception of the troops a success. .
"The executive committee, I may re
mark, is composed of the editors of the
three leading daily papers and it is
more than a coincidence that the dra
matic profession now comes to their as
sistance. You will remember that be
fore the days of newspapers the play
ers disseminated the news from ham
let to hamlet, from castle to castle,
from court to court, and Shakespeare,
so dear to that profession, has said:
'Good my Lord, will you see the play
ers well bestowed? They are the ab
stract and brief chroniclers of the time.
Better have a bad epitaph than their
ill report.'
"Far from having -their evil report,
we have their good opinion and co
operation. And they, the original dis
seminators of news, have come to the
aid of our newspapers. They who hold
in the hollow of their hands the des
tinies of our States, who fight our wars,
who fight our officers, who direct our
statesmen, who are in fact omniscient
and all wise, have gone back to the
dramatic profession for assistance and
it has responded nobly.
"I am here in behalf of the news
papers to thank the artists and to in
form you that they have undertaken a
great taskâ the raising of $50,000. But,
if it is a very great task, it is for a
worthy purpose. It is our duty to wel
come these brave boys, not so much in
the name of San Francisco, but in the
name of the nation, for it will be in this
city that they will set their feet again
on American soil for the first time.
"A monster entertainment is to be
given here Thursday, beginning at 12
o'clock â an entertainment the like of
which has never been seen by the
theater goers of San Francisco, experi
enced as they are in wonderful things.
Many of you have your favorites now
appearing on the stage in this city â
the men have their favorite actresses,
and perhaps the ladies have their fav
orite actors. (Laughter.) And there is
a difference of opinion among. many of
you as to the histrionic merits, ability
and charm of these people. There will
be a competition right here on this
stage next Thursday, in which each
actor and actress will vie with every
other to show the mettle in them. The
press will be silent on that day as it is
under deep obligations to the profes
sion, but you will be able to express
yourselves on the merits of the profes
sionals. They will, therefore, be upon
their best behavior and do their best to
win your approval. Therefore, come
one and all, but in order to come you
will have to pay your way and as it is
in a good cause do not be backward in
paying.
"We have here Wendell Easton, who
will offer these seats. Apart from the
merits of the performance the sale of
seats will enable the committee to give
a fit reception to the boys who have
offered up their lives in defense of their
country. Therefore let your giving be
commensurate with the worthiness of
the object."
The applause that followed Mayor
Phelan to his seat was a satisfactory
evidence that the crowd was in a re
ceptive mood. Wendell Easton jumped
forward to clinch the nail.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "on
behalf of my fellow auctioneers I take
pleasure in saying to you that we ac
cept the invitation of the theatrical
managers committee to do our part of
enabling you to knock these little black
spots off the map. as the California vol
unteers have knocked those other black
spots, the Filipinos, off the map. We
do not propose to do much talking. You
understand the business in front of us.
This is a serious matter. This is war.
"This house Was not built for war.
It was built for peace and I'm sure
many of you have enjoyed a number of
pieces here. We are not able to go down
and face you even. We are going to
attack you in the rear. We are going
to come down .and charge you face to
face and reach with our hands into
your pocket books." ..."â . ;'
Mr Easton then explained the plan of
the auction, impressing on the minds of
prospective bidders the fact that the
money they bid was only in the way
of premiums and that in addition they
would have to pay the fixed price for
each box and' seat.
"Now, girls," he said, turning to the
semicircle of beauty, "up and at 'em!"
And at 'em they went, as Mr. Easton
had planned, aiming to take the friend
ly enemy In the rear. Out through the
flies and down into the pit in single file2
they charged, making th" half circuit
of the theater, coming in close order
up the center aisle, Sergeant of Police
Shea in the lead, followed by Manager
Gottlob and the line of stage beauties,
which deployed neatly through the au
dience as Mr. Easton and Colonel J. L.
Lyon took their stand In the pulpit-like
structure "they called a block set in the
orchestra. In front on a more lowly
block was a blacksmith's anvil, and a
man stationed above with a hammer to
clinch the sales.
"Keep yc-ur > yes on us," said Easton,
shedding his cuffs, "and we'll keep ours
on you. How much am I offered for
choice of the first box?"
"Fifty," piped a voice from the far
right.
"Going, going " from Co-ronel
Lyon..
"Sixty," said another.
"Seventy-live," came in tones that
were recognized as those of C. 13. Stone
of the Associated Breweries.
"Hundred."
"Hundred and fifty." -
"Two hundred."
My, how things were going, going.
"Two fifty."
The mark set by the managers had
been reached.
" "Three hundred!" in a woman's voice.
"Here's a lady bids three hundred."
"Three twenty-five," said Mayor
Phelan.
Three fifty." retorted the lady.
Things were becoming lively and half
the audi.-. ice were out of their (hairs,
highly excited.
Then "three seventy-five," said Stone,
and the lady topped him twenty-five, to
be raised twenty-five more in return.
Cheers upon cheers rent the air, but
the steady advance of the bidding could
not be stopped. Everybody's eyes were
centered on the lady with the . jaunty
white hat. In which perched a saucy
feather, all thinking she was the bidder
whose identity was a mystery. 'Nobody
paid any attention to the elderly
woman in black sitting at her side, on
horn at the hysterica! stages in the
bidding she bestowed a hasty kirs.
Four fifty it went, five, hundred, six
hundred in jumps of fifty.
"Listen to the lady," said Mr. Eastc-n.
"There's a woman for you."
"Rah! Rah!" cheered the audience.
many of the women waving their
handkerchiefs. a number being so
wrought up that tears, they knew not
for what reason, started from their
eyes.
"Six fifty," sit id the Mayor.
"Seven hundred," from the -. unen by
the anvil.
There war- a tense lull. "Going, go
ing!" warned Colonel Lyon. The man
with the hammer raised It high over
his head ready to come down.
"Fifty, fiftyâ can I have r<-ven fifty?"
shrieked the colonel to the Mayor. Mr.
J 'he];..-. nodded.
"Seven fifty I have; make it eight."
Th- lady nodded.
"Eight hundredâ Ing, goingâ" and

for bo doing did not present itself until 'he iroopi began pourlrs into the X

bought handkerchiefs to be used as mufflers by the men, but secured baths ,
for "the entire command at tro's; paid for their lunches and car fare to and ,

wants giving ird words to the sick, bringing them delicacies o-.d ' - son- 3

she became beloved by the soldiers, who actually worshiped her. Many i
of the members of the Tennessee regiment .wrote home to their loved ones )

Duringith. bidding! yesterday she save an Instance of her retiring dlsposi- '

"I am' a bidder," she quietly replied. Mott thinks now she's the queen .
of bidders. So does everybody else. '
The managers felt so deeply grateful to Mrs. Townsend that they gave :
her hot only a vote of thanks and three rousing cheers at a meeting of their -
committee held after the performance, but v. -ted to present her with the Â»

Would the Mayor show the white

THE CHECK THAT TELLS THE STORY OF THE SALE.
Treasurer Meverfeld of the theatrical managers' committee received after the action, In payment of the premium
bid by Mrs. A. S. Townsend for the first two boxes sold at the Orpheum auction for the California Volunteers' benefit,
a cashier's check of the Bank of California for $2025.
and after a lull again the Mayor.
Twenty-fives began piling up until $500
was reached by his Honor. -
"Have I nine seventy-five?
"Nine seventy-five," nodded the lady
In the white hat. â¢â
"Nine . seventy-fiveâ going, going â
very slowlyâ going, goingâ gone!"
The hammer struck the anvil and the
first box was Bold. Half a dozen of the
managers crowded around the lady to
get her name. They got their heads
close together while the audience
cheered. "Doc" Leahy at last caught
the eye of the auctioneer and said
something that could not be heard ten
feet away for the cheers. Finally Mr.
Easton got his chance.
"Mrs. A. S. Townsend is the pur
chaser, but she will not take the box,"
he said, "unless she be allowed to pay
$1000 for it."
"Three cheers for Mrs. Townsend,"
yelled a man a few rows back. " 'Ray!"

There were cheers for General Shatter
and cheers on general principles, mostly
1 for Mrs. Townsend, whom nobody knew,
but everybody admired. All had It fixed
In their minds that she was the lady with

taken in that, but she certainly had a
feather In her cap, even if she was sitting
modestly out of sight. All over the thea
ter the managers were In smiles, and the
bevy of beautiful actresses were pleased
to think how easy one woman was mak
ing the way for them. At the rate the
' auction had started they didn't care much
If there wasn't any need for their serv
ices. Mr. Easton thought he might use
Edna Wallace Hopper alongside him, and
he sent for the little lady. She was
cheered as she tripped daintily to the
"pulpit" and perched herself on its edge.
She whispered in Mr. Easton's ear.
"The lady says we must have $1500 for
this next box. You all know her. She is

a Californian, and what she says goes!"
There was a bid of $150, at which the
petite actress meouwed prettily, and tha.
fetched a bid of $200 and one last follow
in "NÂ°o f $300.. chirped the theatrical cherub
from her perch. "That'll never do.. __ it
teen hundred." , , . â *.Â«..-, >.:,.
Non-bidders cheered and two oth3r_> hid
$400 and $500, respectively.
"She says no," cried Mr. Easton. No
body had oeen bidding but C. B. Stone and
the Mayor up to this time, and it looked
as if the battle was between them . me
fact that both had subscribed liberally to
the reception fund gave promise of a 'liver
ly fight. Under the "meouws and the
"no, no. nos" of Edna Wallace Hopper
and her pretty little klckings they ad
vanced at jumps of $50 to $750. Â.__
Another portentous lull followed, Ldna
Wallace making her prettiest ey*.B and
giving her most fetching little kicks. It
looked as if the hammer would drop to
Mayor Phelan's last bid. It dkln t, how
ever. The woman with the feather In
her cap jumped up again. â 
"Mrs. Townsend bids $800 for this box.
She bids $850. Do I get MOO?" â â  â  ,
The Mayor nodded and cheers broke for
him and 'his woman opponent.
"Nine-fifty she bids," said Colonel
Lyon.
"One thousand." said the Mayor.
"Do I get fifty?" The lady in the
feathered hat kissed the other. Y\ hen
they separated the applause was deafen
ing. After it had ceased Mr. Easton an
nounced: ' ,
"Mrs. Townsend bids a thousand and
twenty-five! Mrs. Hopper Insists on $1100.
Do I hear it?" V â â 
He didn't. There was another pause,
but no voice was raised higher.
"Going, going,' going," called Colonel
Lyon. "Sold to Mrs. A. S. Townsend for
$1023."
"Three cheers for Mrs. Towns. .
shouted Manager Belasco. and he got
them. The lady with the feather In her
hat kissed the other. Everybody was on
tiptoe, wondering who in the world she
could be and how many more thousands
she had to spend. Their curiosity could
not be satisfied just then. The auction
had to go on.
"How much for the next box?"
"Mayor Phelan bids a thousand dollars,"
called Manager Friedlander.
Edna Wallace Hopper was not satisfied.
She called "more, more," but it was not
forthcoming, and the box was sold to the
Mayor, for whom three hearty cheers
were also given.
The fourth box was sold without much
opposition to C. B. Stone of the Asso
ciated Breweries, whose highest bid was
$050. i
"Three cheers for Stone, cried some
one.
"Make II three beefs!" said another,
but the cheers were given with a will.
The price of boxes drooped then, but bid
ders increased Under the persuasive elo
quence of the women cf the theaters, and
one after another â â¢â â¢:â¢ Bold until four
teen had been disposed cf. Mrs. Ernestine

sale of seats ' went merrily on until 3 [
o'clock, when the cashier's tab showed a i
total In premiums of $5564 50, just $564 50
more than the managers anticipated from
the entire benefit. They were congratu
lated on all hands and, as became them,
had nothing but good words to say of
their aids. Wendell Easton and his co
adjutor. Colonel J. L. Lyon, a Grand
Army veteran, were given a large meed
of praise, as were also their assistants.
They included the pick of the office, and
the admirable system -which allowed the
auction to. proceed without a particle of
friction was entirely due to their inti
mate knowledge of all the details and the
untiring zeal with which they carried out
their respective duties. Miss A. Watson,
Miss E. Klotz and Miss M. Babcock per
formed the stenographic work in master
ful style. Besides these the following
assisted: B. H. Nelson, manager of the
real estate department; A. H. Quartman.
manager of the house renting depart
ment; W. S. Armstrong, private secretary
to Mr. Easton, and Clerks J. Dunne, F. J.
i Knewing and G. O. Johnson.
George H. Meyers, treasurer of the
[ Orpheum Theater, likewise did excellent
service In receiving the moneys, and his
experience was invaluable to the Starr.
It is all over and it was a good job.
The benefit will realize $10,000.
MANAGERS ARE
HIGHLY PLEASED
They Pass Votes of Thanks
to All Who Assisted
Them.
Immediately after the auction sale was
concluded the theatrical managers ad
journed to the Orpheum Annex. Jacob
Gottlob called the. meeting to order. Three
cheers for Mrs. Townsend for her pa
triotic and generous bids in the premium
sale were proposed and given with a will.
It was the sense of the meeting that the
action of Mrs. Townsend was largely in
strumental In making the sale the enor
mous success that it was, and a special
vote of thanks was ordered spread on the
minutes and will be sent to her.
The managers desire to express through
the press their sincere gratitude to all
who in any way assisted in the sale and
more especially to the ladies whose pres
ence was regarded as an inspiration.
The managers desire it to be thoroughly

downstairs have been disposed of. All the

SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO. Aug. 10.â A courier arrived from Humacao brings information
of the complete destruction of that city, which had a population of 8000. Only two build
ings in the place are standing. The loss of life is large. Sixty-four persons are known to
have been killed. The injured number 200. The property loss will be about $2,000,000.
In Yabuco, a town of 4000 inhabitants, every house is down with the exception of one.
Twenty persons were killed.
The total number of deaths thus far reported is 136.
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, Aug ,
10. A hurricane broke over the j
south coast at 1 o'clock Tuesday ]
morning and swept northwest. j
There was no abatement for nine i
hours, the greatest damage being done
between 8 and 10 o'clock a m. The
wires were down and communication j
â with the interior was for a time impos- j
sible. It is now chiefly carried on by
couriers.
At San Juan four natives were
drowned in the harbor; eighty houses
â were demolished and hundreds were un- j
roofed. The damage to property is es- ;
timated at (500,000. Commissary stores j
to the value of $50,000 were destroyed.
A dispatch by cable from Ponce, sent j
at 10 o'clock this morning, says the
town was almost destroyed. Almost all
the frame buildings are down, the
bridge is swept away and there is no
communication between the port and
the city proper. The damage to the
port Is estimated at $250,000. Two na
tives are known to have been drowned.
The records and the property of the
custom house are ruined and all the
vessels are ashore.
At Aibonito very little remains stand
ing except the cathedral and the bar- ,
racks. Four natives perished and three
United States soldiers were badly in- j
jured. As the town is without provi
sions, Government renef has been dis
patched thither.
El ..nay was leveled to the ground,
200 houses being demolished. Two
United States soldiers were injured |
there, and many cavalry horses killed.
At Catano the entire plant of the
Standard Oil Company was ruined.
The loss on the property is (200,000. At
Jiayamon, a majority of the houses
were destroyed and the rest were flood
ed. Two hundred cattle were killed and
the railroad was seriously damaged.
The village of Carolina was literally
razed. At Caguas four persons were
killed.
A courier who has just arrived from
Humacao, capital of the province of
that name, on the eastern coast of the
island, reports awful destruction. The
loss to property is estimated at $600,
--000, but this is the least item in the
disaster. The courier brought an offi
cial report from Captain Eben Swift of
the Fifth United States Cavalry, who
says: "Humacao was totally destroyed
by the hurricane. Forty-six bodies
have been recovered and there are
many more in the debris. Eight pri
vates of Troop C were injured, two fa-
Tally. Sergeant King of the Eleventh
Infantry was injured. North, a dis
charged private, is missing. At the
port of Humacao eighty-one bodies
have been recovered. Eight hundred
people are starving here."
Three persons were killed at Las
Pledras, and five at Junco. Couriers
from the other districts are anxiously
expected at the palace. The steamer
Slocum, Captain Thomas, en route
from Mayaguez to San Juan, was
caught in the storm, but her passen
gers and crew were saved through the
heroism of Mr. Single, the first officer.
The coffee crop is ruined and the loss
will reach millions. Very great injury
has been done also to the orange crop.
No definite returns have yet been re
ceived from the southern section of the
island, apart from Ponce. It Is cer
tain, however, that the food supply in
the stricken districts has been de
stroyed and in these quarters the
quantity of Government stores on hand
Is small. Relief wagons will be sent
to-morrow In various directions.
General George W. Davis, the Gover
nor General, has cabled to the War De
partment an appeal for assistance.

PORT DE FRANCE. Island of Mar

I ricane that St. Thomas and St. Croix |
i suffered lightly, that St. Antigua was |
j seriously hit and at St. Kitts two hun- j
dred houses were destroyed. j
The hurricane passed over l orto |
Plata and appears to have ravaged the j
north of the Dominican republic. All
communication between Porto Plata
and the interior, not Including San
Domingo, la interrupted, and it is im
possible to obtain a correct account of
â  the damage done, although it is thought
to be important. The railroad from
Porto Plata to San Domingo is no

Eventually the -hurricane swept over
Cape Haytien with less violence and
therefore with correspondingly less

ST THOMAS, Aug. 10.â The hurri
cane which has wrought such destruc
tion in the West Indies was central to
east of Dominica on Monday, and was
then traveling northwest.
In Dominica some damage was done,
but more in Martinique. There was
serious loss of property in Guadeloupe.
A hundred lives were lost in Montser
rat. which was completely devastated.
Th* official death list is already seven
ty-four. Antigua and St. Kitts suffer
ed severely. Tremendous devastation
was done in St. Croix and thirty labor
ers were killed. There were several
marine disasters Including, the schoon
er Melbourne, which was stranded.
Much stock was lost.
In St. Thomas the principal destruc
tion was caused by the sea. Most of
the. wharves were destroyed. Part of a
wharf went down and fifty tons of coal
of the Hamburg Company were lost.
The storm struck San Juan, Porto
Rico, at daylight Monday and caused
great destruction.
The hurricane was last reported at
Turks Island yesterday. It was also
reported to have struck San Domingo
yesterday and was expected at San
Jago to-night. Crops have suffered se
verely everywhere.
As later advices come in from Mont
serrat. it is seen that the first reports
conveyed only a faint idea of the suf
ferings of the people and their deplor
able condition. The administration ap
peals for help. ;"â !*.
At La Pointe-a-Pitre, Island of
Guadeloupe, immense damage was
wrought and according to a report not
yet confirmed, 102 persons were killed.
In the Island of St. Croix, the largest
of the Virginia Islands, the destruction
was appalling. It was chiefly wrought
at the west end, where the smaller
houses are a tangled mass of wreckage.
Thirty persons were killed and the in
habitants are in great distress.
COMMANDER DAVIS'
REPORT ON STORM
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â Secre
tary of War to-day received the fol
lowing report from General Davis,
commanding in Porto Rico, on the cy
clone of last Tuesday:
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Aug. 9.â
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 11, 1899.
hurricane of extreme violence passed
over Porto Rico yesterday. The princi
pal military loss at San Juan, one tem
porary company barrack wholly de
stroyed, some quartermaster property
damaged. No personal, lnjuries yet re
ported, but all wires are down. No in
jury to shipping here, save two small
local schooners sunk, two sailors
drowned. San Juan lights temporarily
disabled. Cable reports from Ponce
say all shipping is ashore. Custom
house sheds badly damaged and goods
stored therein.
Messengers from two interior posts
tell of barracks unroofed and consid
erable property damaged. The loss to
inhabitants is very great and extreme
suffering must result. The last hur
ricane as severe as this was in 1876,
when owing to loss of houses, fruit and
provisions there was famine. I would
suggest public notice in the United
States to the effect that contributions
of food, clothing and money for the
destitute would be received with the
greatest gratitude and will be applied
strictly to relief of the destitute. Have
appointed a board to supervise distri
bution. There are many thousands of
families who are entirely homeless and
great distress must follow.
DAVIS, Commanding.
SHIPPING SUNK
IN ALL DIRECTIONS
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug. 10.â
Great havoc has been wrought by the
i hurricane, according to the latest re
ports from Porto Rico, San Domingo,
Guadeloupe, Antigua, The Bahamas, St.
Thomas and St. Croix. Although the
i storm was apparently less severe than
most of those recorded at these islands,
its disastrous effects were felt most se
verely in Porto Rico, St. Thomas and
St. Croix. Everywhere shipping suffer
i ed, scores of sailing vessels being sunk,
especially at Guadeloupe. Crops were
destroyed in many places and wide
spread distress will probably result.
The velocity of the hurricane was more
than seventy miles an hour.
In St. Thomas two hundred houses
were destroyed. The harbor there was
much damaged. In Porto Rico and St.
Croix many lives were lost. It is fear
ed that shipping at sea has suffered
heavily. In Antigua the principal dam
age was done to estates, though towns
also were devastated. The British
West Indies are deeply indebted to
timely warnings of the American
Weather Bureau at Havana, which
saved much shipping. The bureau's
forecasts were most accurate and re
: liable. Full details of the devastation
i are not yet forthcoming, but it is feared
| that some islands are badly crippled.
American commercial Interests are in

WASHINGTON, August 10.â The

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, .Aug. 10.â A special to
the Brooklyn Eagle from Washington
says: The State Department will call
the attention of the British Govern
ment to the alleged interview given out
at Victoria, 8.C., by Lieutenant Com
mander P. S. St. John of the British
gunboat Peacock, in which he indulged
in severe criticism of General Otis and
the latter's conduct of the war in the
Philippines. The War Department has
already taken steps to secure an offi
cial denial of the remarks. When Ad
jutant General Corbin was seen by the
Eagle correspondent this afternoon he
said he had seen extracts from the in
terview and that he was inclined to
doubt its authenticity.
Inquiry was made at the Navy De
: partment with the result that the offi-
c ial register of the British navy showed
that there is such an officer in the
; service, his full name being Percy
Stuart St. John. An officer was also
discovered in the Bureau of Naval In
j telligence who knew Lieutenant Com
i mander St. John, having met him on
i the China station. This officer ex
, pressed great surprise that St. John
: should have given utterance to such in-
I discreet remarks, although, he added,
i he was a free talking man and easily
approached. When the War Depart
ment officials learned of this it was de
termined to push the matter. General
! Corbin stated to the Eagle correspond
i ent that he had sent for papers con
taining a full report of the interview.
"We shall refer them to the State
â  Department," he said, "and the State
! Department officials will investigate."
Acting Secretary of State Adee
said he had not yet heard anything of
the delegation of American citizens
which Commander St. John stated was
coming to the United States for the
purpose of petitioning this Govern
ment to exchange the Philippine Isl-
a nds for Jamaica.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â Captain J

Reported Insolvency of Alexander Mc-
Donald, "the Klondike King."
CHICAGO, August 11.â A special I
from Victoria, B. <'.. says: Advices from :
Dawson say Alexander McDonald, the j
"Klondike King," has filed a petition in
insolvency, stating his liabilities to be
$6,000,000. McDonald was supposed to
be worth $10,000,000 a year ago.
* * â¢
McDonald arrived at Juneau about
two years ago with only $3 50 in his
pocket from Aspinwall, where he had
been a miner and mine owner about
twelve years. He worked there in sil
ver mines and the depreciation in the
price of silver took away his fortune.
Then he decided to try mining in
Alaska. McDonald was so poor at
that time that he was compelled to
ask the consideration of Messrs. Olds
and â  >rton, proprietors of a hotel here,
and they being old miners readily
granted it. He went to work for
wages in the Tread well mines. For
several months he had saved consider
able money and left for the Yukon Val

Incidentally, the chart shows that the
construction of the Nicaraguan Canal
would bring the Philippine Islands only
about 500 miles nearer the port ot New-
York than by the present route.
Steaming by way of the Suez Canal
a troopship, according to the chart,
will have to cover 11,556 miles, while
proceeding from San Francisco to the
same point the vessel would only have
to steam 6493 miles. Were the Nicar

ing from New York to Manila would
; have to cover 11,034 miles, making a
I difference of 552 miles in favor of this
route over that of the Suez Canal for

The distance between Manila and the
j island of Guam is 1506 miles, between
j Manila and the Pelew Islands, which
j Admiral Bradford urged the Peace
i Commission to acquire, but which Ger

DREYFUS CLIMAX
COMING TO-MORROW
MERCIER AND
THE ACCUSED
FACE TO FACE
Dramatic Scene Anticipated
When the Two Foes
Meet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENNES, Aug. 10.â The members
of the Dreyfus court-martial to
day took the testimony of MM.
Chamoine and Paleologue. The
former was examined from 6:30
i to 9:30 and the latter was on the stand
j from 9:30 to 11:45 a. m., when the court
adjourned until to-morrow, when it will
conclude the examination of the secret
dossier.
Colonel. Jouaust, president of the
i court-martial, on leaving the court to
day, said a public session would take
I place Saturday.
The police adopted the same methods
of precaution as yesterday, and there
was only the smallest gathering of
j spectators. Captain Dreyfus was al
j lowed to walk to and from the Lycee
| without his usual escort of four or six
j gendarmes. Only a captain of gen-
I darmes was with him and this officer
walked a few steps behind the prisoner.
Saturday's public session will be a
, veritable field day. probably the most
! important and exciting day " of the
whole trial, as General Mercier and M.
'â¢ Casimir-Perier have been cited to give
: their testimony then.
The first witness will be Lieutenant
Colonel de la Roche Vernet, French
Military Attache in Berlin at the time
of the arrest of Dreyfus. His evidence,
it is expected, will be soon disposed of
and then General Mercier will be called.
A dramatic scene is anticipated by
the anti-Dreyfusites, who rely upon
i him to throw a bombshell and confound
the accused once for all. His words:
"1 have complete proofs of the guilt
of Dreyfus," are remembered, and both
sides are waiting for him to prove his
statement.
. The Dreyfusites believe that his tes
j timony will be torn to pieces by MM.
Laborie and Demange and that he will
j leave the court utterly discredited.
I Captain Dreyfus will have the right
ley. That was the beginning of Mc-
Donald's fortune. He got to the Klon
dike shortly after the first locations
were made. At the time he was mining
a claim on Miller Creek, near Forty-
Mile. He threw down his pick and left
the cabin on Miller Creek as It stood,
though the ground was paying wages.
It was his knowledge of mining and
his confidence in himself which
brought his success as a miner and as
an operator on the Klondike. He
owned more claims than any other man
In Dawson, and only one or two poor
ones.
McDonald was born In Antlgonlsh
County, Nova Scotia, in November,
1854. A short time ago he went to Lon
don, England, with his confidential
man and partner in some claims, Ron
ald Morrison. The steamer from Daw
son could not get up the river farther
than Rink Rapids and McDonald and
others had to vole up the river rr m
that point to Lake Bennett in a small
j boat.
to question him, and It is expected
that the latter's cross-examination of
Mercier will prove the climax of the
whole proceedings.
Former President Casimir-Perier
will follow, if possible, the same day,
but it is doubtful whether his examina
tion will be concluded before court ad
journs until Monday. There will be no
session on Tuesday, that being As
sumption day. 'â¢....
Maitre Demange, the principal coun
sel for Captain Dreyfus, in an Inter
view after to-day's session with a rep
resentative of the Associated Press,
expressed himself as very well con
tented with the way in which matters
are proceeding, and, judging from his
manner, one may say that the defend
ers of the accused have not yet met
anything very surprising or alarming
In the secret dossier. Naturally, M. De
mange declined to give any particulars
respecting the contents of the dossier,
but he declared that he and his col
league, M. Laborie, were satisfied of
the conscientious desire of the mem
bers of the court to thresh the whole
matter out and to have full light
turned upon the accusations against
their client.
This will take some time and the end
of the month will be reached before
judgment can be given. Meanwhile the
strain is telling on Dreyfus, who is
showing physical distress.
Colonel Henry, the Red Traitor.
LONDON, Aug. 11.â The Times says:
We are in a position to state that in
addition to communications of slight
value ""enumerated in the bordereau
more than 160 documents of consider
able importance were furnished to the
German attache in Paris, Colonel
Schwarzkoppen, at various times by
Esterhazy, acting as intermediary for
and accomplice of the late Lieutenant
Colonel Henry. A-y.
One of these documents contained de
tailed information relative to the gen
eral plan of mobilization of the French
army. The proceeds of this traffic were
divided between- Esterhazy and Henry.
In Parisian diplomatic circles . the lat
ter was known to be the red traitor for

more than one European government

SANTA TERESA LEADS
THE YAQUI BRAVES
WOMAN AT
THE HEAD OF
THE REVOLT
Yaqui Rebellion Incited by
the Maiden Who Hates
the Mexicans.
REGARDEDiS A SAINT
â Â« â
For Years She Has Wielded a
Powerful Influence Over the
Indian Tribe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. 10.â Santa
Teresa, the patron saint of the
Yaqui Indians, has been among
that tribe for the past three
months endeavoring to Incite
them to revolt against the Mexican
Government, and how well she has suc
ceeded is shown by the recent uprising
of the Yaquis, which promises to re
sult In great bloodshed. It is not im
probable that the war will continue un
til almost every member of the tribe
has been exterminated. Santa Teresa
is urging the braves to throw off the
yoke which she claims the Mexican
Government has placed upon them and
to resume their old spirit of freedom
and independence.
Teresa de Urrea, who is known to
the Indians and lower class of Mexi
cans throughout Western Mexico as
Santa Teresa de Cabora, possesses
wonderful and unaccountable powers
as a healer of the sick and afflicted, and
to the simple-minded Indians she is a
divine being, it was through her ad
vice that the Yaqui Indians went on
the warpath about five years ago and
made such bold and daring attacks on
the Mexican troops that they won
every battle. At that time Teresa was
a. mere girl, not over 16 years of age.
She was born and was at that time
living near one of the Yaqui Indian vil
lages in the northern part of the State
of Sonora. Her parents were ignorant
Tomachic Indians. She claims that
one beautiful morning in the early part
of summer she went to the spring near
her home to get some water, when the
Archangel Gabriel appeared before her
and handed her a letter written in
Spanish, of which the following is the
English translation, as printed and
sold by the thousands of copies by the
girl and her followers along the Mexi
can border during the past few years:
To the Saint of Cabora. Teresa de
Jesusâ My Daughter: If my sacred heart
had not burned with divine love for man,
I should long ago have cast them into
the depth of hell for the terrible offenses
with which they have profaned my jus
tice. But as mv heart is that of a living
father, and tor man's salvation, I have
shed mv precious blood upon the cross in
order that they may have time to re
pent of their sins. Now, if they do not
so I will make them feel the rigor of my
justice. I will visit upon them sickness
and I will hasten the judgment day when
the good shall be separated from th*. bad
and "will say to the wicked: "Go, sin
ners, to the fires of hell for all _.errity:
you will not hear me when I spoke nor
have you paid attention to my advice.
Go. sq to live in the eternal flame-- of
hell." And to the good I will say: "Come,
blessed of my father, who listen to my
words; come and share in my glory as
your reward for submission and obedi
ence; come and enjoy everlasting life."
Therefore I desire that they should re
pent in their hearts, have care for their
souls. adore and venerate the Holy-
Mother Mary, who is the one that pleads
most with me for the salvation of sin
ners and happiness of men; recite the
rosary; revere the holy . cross; respect
their superiors; give to the needy. I will
he merciful to all who comply with my
precepts and will fill them with prosper
ity, and will cause them to succeed in all
their enterprises or business; and if any
one should Bay that this letter does not
come from God, I will crush out the In

blessings. Among the number were
many crippled and afflicted men and
women. The girl laid her hands upon
these unfortunate sufferers and they
went their way rejoicing, proclaiming
that they had been made whole and re
stored to health by her divine touch.
The fame of the girl spread so rapidly
and caused so much excitement that
the Mexican authorities became
alarmed. The Tomachic Indians looked
upon Santa Teresa as their special pro
tector, and when a force of Mexican
troops arrived in that locality and sent
word that the gathering of fanatics
would have to disperse the girl told
the Tomachics that they must follow
her standard and she would lead them
to victory. .
The Tomachics rallied around the girl
when the force of soldiers arrived at
the place and gave the final order for
them to disperse. The several hundred
Indians refused to obey- the order and
a charge was made upon them by the
soldiers. It was a desperate battle and
resulted in the routing of the Toma
chics They rallied a few days later
at another point in that section. Santa
Teresa took personal command of the
small army of Indians and when- the
second attack was made she was in
the thickest of the fray. The Toma
chics met with a terrible slaughter and
the girl and a few of her followers
barely escaped into the mountains with
their lives. It was the last battle the
Mexican troops had with the Toma
chic Indians. That tribe was practically
wiped out of existence in the two fights.
Santa Teresa then sought refuge in
the heart of the Yaqui Indian country
and became the patron saint of the
Yaquis. She had been with them but a
few weeks when she worked the braves
up to such a high pitch of excitement
that they made an attack on a large
force of Mexican soldiers not far from
the town of Ures. Santa Teresa was
with them and was captured by the
Mexican troops. Her power had be
come well known to the Mexican mili
tary and civil authorities and It was
generally agreed that she should be se
verely punished. She was taken over
land to Guaymas, a distance of over 200
miles, under the escort of a troop of
cavalry. She was placed in prison at
Guaymas, but had been in her new
quarters but a few days when a courier
arrived from the Yaqui country bearing
a note from the chief of the tribe, in
forming the military commander at
Guaymas that unless Santa Teresa was
immediately released from prison an
attack would be made on the town and
all the buildings burned. Twelve hours
were given the Mexican commander in
which to comply with the demand. The
commander at Guaymas immediately
communicated with President Diaz, ac
quainting the latter with the situation,
and asked what should be done with
the prisoner. The President replied, or
dering that the girl be exiled from Mex
ico. She was placed on a northbound
train on the Sonora railroad that even
ing, in charge of an armed guard, and
taken to Nogales, Arizona, and turned
loose with the strict injunction that if
she ever set foot in Mexico again and
was captured she would be shot.
Santa Teresa remained in Nogales
for several months. Thousands of af
flicted Mexicans and Yaqui Indians
visited her there. She disappeared one
day and when next heard of she was
the leader of a band of Yaqui Indians
who made a raid on the town of Fron
teras, near the United States border.
Several Indians and a number of Mexi
cans were killed in that raid. Again,
she was forced to leave the country
and this time she sought refuge in El
Paso, Texas, where she lived In com
parative quiet for several months. She
performed many apparently miraculous
cures of afflicted persons while in El
Paso.
She again disappeared and next came
into public notice as the chief actor in
an army of about 1000 fanatical Mexi
cans in the State of Chihuahua, Mexi
co. They had their camp just across
the Rio Grande from Presidio del Norte,
Texas, and the wonderful woman seem
ed to have full sway over her followers.
This gathering of fanatics became so
large that the Mexican authorities be
came alarmed, the report having reach
ed Chihuahua that they intended start
ing a revolution against the Mexican
Government. A regiment of soldiers
was sent out from Chihuahua to dis
perse the fanatics. The troops went to
Sierra Mojada by train and then
marched overland to the border, a dis
tance of 100 miles. The religious fan
atics refused to obey the order to dis
perse, and a conflict took place in which
six soldiers and twenty fanatics were
killed.
Santa Teresa escaped across the river
and kept in hiding in Texas until the
excitement died out. She then returned
to El Paso, where she lived until her
recent disappearance.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. 10.â A Fargo
(N. D.) special to the Pioneer Press
| says:
Two million bushels of wheat are es
timated to have been lost in to-day's
hailstorm, which partially destroyed
the crop on nearly 250,000 acres of land
in this State. Farmers who were busily
engaged this morning were driven to
their barns for shelter and afterward
found it unnecessary to take the bind
ers back to the fields as the grain had
been harvested by hail in a few brief
moments.
Just before 11 o'clock the .storm
struck the northern part of Cass and
southern part of Traill counties. In
addition to a big area over which hail
fell thickly, heavy wind and rain
storms completed the destruction of
thousands of acres of grain.
On either side of the center of the
path of the hail, covering an area fif
teen miles north and south between
Argusville and Gardiner in Cass, to
Kelso in Traill, and on the east and
west territory ranging from five miles
wide on the south to fifteen or twenty
on the north, the country is practically
devastated. Losses are estimated all

WRANGEL, Alaska. Aug. 6 (via Seattle,

steamer Strathcona arrived here to-day
with thirty survivors of the Edmonton
trail.
They are: M. Randleman, Chicago; J.

Tiger, Prince Albert Province, Canada;
C. Stiefel, Chicago; W. H. Wells, Mis- j
souri; D. Robertson, Vancouver; I. G. â 
Tomllnson, Tacoma.
All these men came in with the pack- :
trains sent out from Telegraph Creek and
Laketon by the various trading companies i
last spring.
These unfortunates tell heartrending j
stories of hardships endured and comrades i
lost and abandoned, and strongly denounce '
the trading and transportation companies, :
as well as the Canadian officials and
newspapers that so profusely advertised |
this route as a feasible one to the Klon- !
dike gold fields. " ]
To outward appearances these men cer- .
tainly give evidence of the awful suffer
ings undergone since leaving Edmonton |
eighteen months ago. Most of them are i
sickly looking, with unkempt beards- and
greasy clothesâ of physical and
financial wrecks. Several are prematurely :
gray and bear the marks of scurvy.
A few have just enough money to reach
Seattle or Victoria, but the majority are
without funds. The citizens of Wrangel
have appealed to the United States Gov
ernment at Washington, but up to this '
date no aid has been received. There are |
now about twenty-five destitute miners i
here. Many had narrow escapes from !
starvation along the Trail from Fort Simp
son to Mud River and Fort Laird. A. H.
Tiger and party lived on red squirrels
and bacon for nearly two weeks.
M. Ostig, C. F. Steifel and M. W.
Weisen, three of a party of five from
Chicago, owe their lives to a bear thaT
they killed just as they had run out of
provisions about twenty miles from
Laird Post. William Schmidt and Fred
Swift of the same party left camp at
Laird Post last spring to trap and have
never, been heard from Since. M. Randle- :
man of Chicago was lost in the woods |
above Fori Laird last fall and was com
pelled to live on bacon for three weeks.
Perry Wells, brother of W. H. Wells,
who was one of the passengers on the ;
Strathcona, died of scurvy at Telegraph
Creek.
It Is estimated that there are still more |
than 100 men scattered along the trail be- |
tween Laird Post and the Pell y Banks, and I
relief parties have been sent out by the
Hudson Bay Company. The last report
brought to Laird Post was that many
were dying of scurvy and hunger. It is
estimated that there are thirty or forty j
sufferers at Telegraph Creek awaiting
the next trip of the boat. The sick that!
had to be carried on stretchers had not
yet reached Glenora when the Strathcona]
sailed.
Several starvation cases are reported.
About twenty miles above Devil's Port
age two unknown men were found frozen
to death last winter. A man bearing the
name of Johnson from New York was j
found dead in a tent near the source of
the Mud River last fall. This poor fellow
had as a covering only half of a blanket,
and In a diary still open and in his hand
were these words opposite to the date,.
February 15, 1897: "I died of hunger."
All along the route from Fort Simpson
on the Mackenzie River to Fort Laird men
with frozen limbs were assisted, while
some, too weak to help themselves, were
necessarily left behind by those more
fortunate and able to struggle along.
Scurvy raged in all the camps more or
less, but there are few deaths from this
disease reported. A number of Canadians
who attempted to cross Cutland Trail
from Fort Simpson to Fort Francis last
fall have never been heard from, and it
is likely that they perished from cold.
Beaupree was the name of one of these
men, and he hailed from Ontario.
Provisions were scarce and high at all
the military posts last winter, and at sev
eral, Including Laird Post and Fort
Francisc; even the post men were put on
short rations during the months of April
and May of this year. Flour sold at $35
per sack, bacon 75 cents per pound and
beans 25 cents per quart. This made up j
the daily menu for several weeks. Many
owe their lives to the relief party under j
Scott Simpson sent out by the Cosca ;
Trading Company, that reached Laird
Post May 23. This daring party â  left
Lake.ton in March and made a most peril- |
ous trip across Dease Lake with dogs. j
As the ice broke up one of* this rescuing
party was drowned and nearly all the 1
dogs" and sleds were lost.
The majority of the returning gold- ,
seekers took the Mackenzie ' water route j
south from Edmonton. Coarse gold was
found in several small streams and gold !
colors were often seen, though not in j
sufficient quantity to work.
MORE TALES OF
DEATH AND DISASTER
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 10.â R. Reed
and brother of Calgary, Northwest Terri
tory, who started for Dawson over the
Edmonton trail eighteen months ago,
reached here to-day from Glenora. They
say about a dozen men were lying at
Glenora in various stages of scurvy and
other sickness brought on by exposure
and insufficient food. Some were badly
frostbitten.
They heard of several deaths at differ
ent points on the trail. A man named
Wells of Kansas City died of scurvy at
Frances Lake a few weeks ago. Another
man named Ford, from somewhere In
Eastern Canada, near Deast Lake, died
about the first week In July. In April
they heard of the death of a German
named Waldemar Wendeleur. He had
started for the coast over the Ice, broke
down and died all alone In a shack be
side th-? trail, where his body was found.
One man. whose name they did not learn,
was drowned In Frances River during
June. His canoe was capsized while com
ing through Middle Canyon. â  Another,
name likewise unknown, was drowned
while going up Deast Lake on the ice.

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 10.â Sec
ond Oregon Regiment has disbanded
and . the men have returned to their
peaceful occupations after fifteen
months' service in the volunteer army
of the United States. The train bearing
700 men arrived here in three sections
at 4 o'clock this afternoon and twenty
thousand people gathered about the
Union Depot to welcome home the vol

From the State line to this city the
regiment received an ovation and
wherever stops were made the citizens
prepared an elaborate spread for them.
Governor Geer and his staff, in a spe
cial car, accompanied the regiment on
their journey from the southern to the
northern boundary of the State. This
morning at 6 o'clock the regiment
breakfasted at Eugene and at Salem
lunch was served to the men in the
State Capitol building. At both these
places the regiment paraded for the

DAY SET FOR SECOND
TRIAL OF DESIRELLO
At the First Trial the Jury Stood Six
for Acquittal and Six for
Manslaughter.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 10.â The second
trial of Frederick Desirollo was set this
morning by consent for the ISth of Sep
tember. Desirello is charged with the
murder of James Johnston, committed at
Colma, in San Mateo County, on the ISth
day of last March. The first trial, lasting
from May 2 to 6, resulted in a disagree
ment, the jury standing six for man
; slaughter and six for acquittal. After
: the trial the defendant was released on
ball and has been employed since that
time in Baden at the Fuller Paint Works.
The defense made by Desirello at the first
trial was accidental shooting..
The facts of the case are as follows: On
the evening of the 18th of March James
Johnston, a young man 17 years of age,
in company with James Jensen and John
Baccari, two other boys, were driving
on the main county road into Colma. their
destination being Belll's store at that
place. Deslrello was at the White House,
a short distance from the store, when the
boys came along. From the testimony
of "Deslrello, borne out by other witnesses,
the boys were either driving recklessly
or the horses were running away. At
any rate, Desirello thought they were
going at an unsafe rate. He called to
the boys to stop, but they did not hear or
heed him.
He thereupon drew his revolver and
shot at the horses In order to stop them,
but unfortunately shot Johnston In the
neck, from the effects of which he died
a few moments later. The boys, Jensen
and Baccari, deny that they were driving
at any other than an ordinary rate of
speed and say Deslrello never called to
them to stop. The Coroner's jury charged
Deslrello with willful murder in the first
degree and the committing magistrate
held him to answer for murder, but the
highest offense voted for by the Trial jury
was manslaughter, as no motive or malice
in the killing could be found. In fact,
Deslrello testified that he did not even
, know the unfortunate boy in his lifetime
i and would have no object In injuring him.
, A jury was drawn to-day to be in attend- i
i ance on the 18th of September.
SANTA BARBARA PARK
LEASED BY OIL MEN
Steps Taken to Recover the Tract
and Prevent Its Disfiguration
by Derricks.
SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 10.â W. H.
Nelson, a saloon-keeper who retired from
his profession to make a fortune at oil
digging along the beach of this city, has
come to the conclusion that he will not
have an easy job of It. He represents a
number of heavy speculators and has a
large amount of capital to back him in
his enterprise. He recently procured a
lease of the Agricultural Park along the
beach, with the understanding that the
park be used for agricultural purposes
and that he would develop it into a
botanical garden. He came here about
two months ago, passing himself off as
an experienced farmer, and said that in
a short time he could irrigate the salt
land Into fertile soil. His offer was Imme
diately accepted on the foregoing condi
tion, as it has been the ambition of the
owners of the property to beautify the
barren tract which is now used as a race
track. Recently he ackuowledged to a
friend that he represented outside capital
and was to invest it in oil digging.
These facts became known to the lessee,
who took Immediate steps to revoke the
lease by which Nelson holds the land, on
the ground that he obtained it through
fraud and misrepresentation. An action
to have the lease annulled will be riled to
morrow.
MILLS HEARING GOES OVER
Judge Buck Advises the Chathams to
Join Issues.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 10.â The Robert
Mills estate was again before the court
this morning, at which time Judge Buck
announced that he would hear and deter
mine the proceedings commenced by the
Chatham claimants under section 1664 of
the Code of Civil Procedure to determine
heirship as soon as the Issues could be
framed. A complaint under that section
was filed by the attorneys for the Chat
hams on the 4th Inst. The parties Inter
ested in the estate have twenty days after
service In which to appear and answer
and then the matter will be in a condi
tion to go to trial. -.-..-.
The court suggested that If Issues could
be joined the case might be tried next
month, as there would be a jury In at

claim to be the son and daughter of
Robert Mills and entitled to two-thirds of
his estate, valued at more than $250,000.
Deceased left no legitimate children and
died intestate, hence his estate would go
one-half to his widow and the remainder

â â
GUN WILL FIRE FOUR HUNDRED
SHOTS A MINUTE.
â¦â â
The Major Intends Taking the Gun
Overland to Washington and
Exhibiting It to Army
Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PEORIA, 111., Aug. 10.â automobile
gun carriage upon which a Colt auto
matic rapid-firing gun will be mounted, Is
now being constructed here. It Is being
made on the order of Major Davidson of
the Highland Park Military Academy.
The carriage will be a. three-wheeled
affair with seats for four men, who will
constitute the crew, and provision for at
least 1000 rounds of cartridges. The
whole concern is expected to weigh about
1000 pounds.
An ordinary six horse-power motor will
be employed, and it is expected to drive
the machine at a good pace over ground
of almost any. character where horses
might be driven. The carriage is de
signed, however, principally for use . in
suppressing riots in the city streets. The
gun Is fixed upon a pivot or turning
plate, so that it may be moved in any
direction at will. The gun Is fired by
simply pulling a back trigger, and will
continue to shoot as long as it la held
back. It will fire 400 shots a minute, or
about seven a second.
Major Davidson intends to take thÂ«
machine to Washington. It is his In
tention to run it overland from High
land Park to the national capital, where
an endeavor will be made to interest
army officials in it. The cost of the
carriage will be only about $1500.
AUTOMOBILE USED FOR
COLLECTING MAIL
WASHINGTON. Aug. 10.â With a view
to the adoption of specially constructed
automobile wagons for the collection of
mall, James E. Bell, superintendent In the
Washington postofflce, to-day made a
preliminary test of collecting mall over
one of the regular city routes in an elec
tric automobile made by the American
Electric Vehicle Company of Chicago.
The start was made about 2 o'clock and
the route from Tenth to Eighteenth
street, northwest on X and I streets, was
covered. This is an easy route, as the
streets were clear and the mall boxes are
not numerous. Further tests will be made
where conditions are more exacting. The
test demonstrated that a large saving of
time Is possible in collecting with an au
tomobile. - _ _._.*_._.
"The trial to-day was very satisfac
tory," said Major Bell. "The collection
route was covered in much less time than
with a horse. Getting in and out of a
high vehicle like the one I used to-day
was not convenient, but suitable wagons
will of course, be built if the automobile
Is adopted for collecting mail. The de
partment spends an immense sum annual
ly for horse hire, and it may be possible
to use this money with greatly increased
results if the automobile mail collecting
wagon proves practicable.
"The electric mobile was used to-day
and the agents make a' good point in
recommending it. They say that the mo
tive power would not cost us a cent here,
as the batteries in the wagons could be
charged by our own electric plant, using
the power which is going to waste."
A CLOSE CALL FOR
STEAMER GOLD STAR
An Exciting Adventure in Five Fin
ger Rapids on the Upper
Yukon.
SEATTLE, Aug. Advices received
from Alaska say the steamer Gold Star
met with an exciting adventure in Five
! Finger Rapids on the Upper Yukon.
They were lining the steamer, up
i through the Five Fingers and had worked
: up to a point where they entered a huge
! eddy. The cable was slackened from the
capstan and steam turned on a bit. The
' vessel plowed ahead, and before she was
' under perfect control again her bow
pushed forward into the strong current,
throwing her nose around. At the same
. time the eddy caught the stern and threw
It about up stream. The effect of this
i was to shoot the Gold. Star straight

MISS ELLIOTT EXPLAINS.
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 10.â Miss Jessie
Elliott, the kindergarten schoolteacher
who removed a piano belonging to "Tho
V's" from the High School building and
was threatened for this procedure with
arrest, is on the warpath.
"I took that piano at the request of
Mrs. J. S. Stratton," she says, "ami 1
aid refuse to give it up because my right
to it was better than anybody else's. 1
have not been threatened with arrest and
intend to see that . those who have ma
ligned me are made to suffer.
"I took the piano from the school be
cause the Board of School Trustees held
a meeting and ordered it taken out of the
building. I did not sneak around there
when the janitor had the doors open
cleaning the halls. The club has not met
for three years and is generally regarded
as defunct." v . .
A school director flatly contradicts the
story of Miss Elliott. that the piano was
ordered removed from the High School
and that. she was notified to be at the
meeting in order to take it away. In
stead of such being true, the director
stated that Miss Elliott appeared before
the board and claimed that the Instru

by force. The board then told her that
she could, take it away, as that body did

QUESTION OF PRISON
CREDITS SETTLED
i Judge Budd Decides a Prisoner Is En
titled to Them Whether He
Works or Not.
STOCKTON, Aug. 10.â Prisoners serv
ing sentence In county jails are entitled
to five days a month credits under the
special act granting Supervisor the
power to commute terms being served in
county jails where the prisoner is recom
'. mended for clemency by the Sheriff.
Such was the decision of Judge Budd
! to-day. when he ordered the release of
i Lee Quong Hong on habeas corpus pro
< ceedings instituted by 'Attorney Scanlan
! in his behalf. Hong was sentenced to the
count y jail for one year for assault. He
i has served ten months of that time ana
has deported himself as a good prisoner.
At a meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors the prisoner asked to be allowed
I credits under the special act of the Leg
j islature. . _ __. â¢ , -"' _- l
District Attorney Ashley opposed the
I release on the ground that the act ap
plied only to prisoners who had been en
gaged on public work. He also raised,
several other points, which questioned
the oowers of the board and the Intent
of the act and virtually left it a dead
letter.
Judge Budd held in effect that proper
proceedings had been had under the law,
that good conduct or work in or out of
the jail entitled a person to credits upon
the recommendation of the Sheriff. If
his conduct was good and he was not
called upon to perform work at all his
privileges under the law remained unim
paired. In briefer form, the court's de
cision was that the act meant just what
it said.

Great Military Activity Indicates
That the Confiiob Is Close
at Hand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. 11.â There is little
tual news this morning concerning
Transvaal affairs. From the silence of
the itches regarding Mr. Chamber
lain's last speech, it looks as though
the - -ship were again active. It is
evident, however, that the amendment
to the constitution empowering the
Government in the event of war to call
upon all Inhabitants without distinction
to" assist in the defense of the state, cre
ated some amount of alarm. The Ger
man outlanders are said to have ap
plied to their consul to interfere in the
matter, while the Standard and the
Diggers News, the Boer organ, pub
lishes a statement that the Government
has sanctioned assurances being given
through the press that there is no idea
of calling upon Englishmen to fight
Englishmen, or in any other way of
ignoring international sentiment, tradi
tion or customs.
Dispatches from Pietermarltzburg re
port considerable military activity
there. The commanding officers have
held a meeting and issued circulars
notifying the volunteers to hold them
selves in readiness for active service.
The Pretoria correspondent of the
Times says: "In order to avoid inter
ference with the Transvaal's internal
affairs, which is the strongest objection
to the proposed conference on the fran
chise bill, the adoption of a five-years'
residence limit is probable. At the
protracted secret sessions of the Volks
raad President Kruger has failed to ob
tain the consent of the members to the
removal of religious disabilities without
the consent of the burghers, but it haÂ»
been left to the President to publish the
bill for consideration next session."
The Johannesburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph says: "In the
Volksraad to-day (Thursday) Mr. Kru
ger declared that he was glad that they
had agreed to stand by the Lord as the
head of the State. The Raad, he con
tinued, was afraid to go off the right
path and away from the Lord. Finally
Mr. Kruger advised the members to
read thoroughly Psalm 119, verse 37.
PLANS FOR ENDING
THE EASTERN WAR
XEW YORK, Aug. 10.â A World special
from Washington says: Secretary Root
began to-day active preparations for con
ducting the final campaign in the Philip
pines. It can be stated that the follow
ing programme win be put into execu
tion as the result of his conference with
President McKinley:
Recruiting will be continued indefinitely
and all available troops will be hurried.
The full quota of troops authorized
under the army reorganization will be
enlisted, and Congress will be asked for j
more men if it becomes necessary. It
is intended to raise the total army in the j
Philippines to 70,000 men at the earliest
possible date.
Otis will be given additional time in j
which to accomplish appreciable results. |
Failing to achieve a greater degree of
success thai heretofore la- will be re
lieved of the military command, but will
not be humiliated.
Miles will not J>e ordered or requested
to go to the Philippines, but will be given
full recognition as the commanding gen
eral of the army.
Merritt will be consulted with reference
to the Philippines, and probably will take
charge of field operations if General Otis
fails to end the war within a reasonable
period.
An order redefining the duties of the
inspector general's department will be \
issued, recognizing General Miles.
Before Secretary Root left the War
Department this afternoon he received a;
list of th* transports available for carry- .
Ing troops, showing the capacity of each
vessel and the dates on which the first, i
second and third voyages can be made, i
On each voyage all the transports can j
carry an aggregate of 18,000 soldiers.
Thus the first and second voyages will
take to the Philip, about 36,000 men. j
or the total additional number believed i
to be necessary to end the war. i
CHAIGNEATJ HAS RESIGNED.
Doings of the Napa Town Trustees
May Be Investigated.
NAPA: Aug. 10.â The Board of Trustees
at its meeting last Monday night refused
to call on Marshal Chaigneau for his
resignation, but instead allowed him to
appoint a deputy.*
Chaigneau has confessed to embezzling
$?Ao<). the most of which sum he has made
good: When discovered, in his shortage
he promised to refund all the money, and
to The Call representative he stated that
st b-ast one of the members of the board
promised him that if he did so he would
not be prosecuted. The action of the
board on last Monday caused much dis
satisfaction. District Attorney Bell has
since notified Marshal Chaigneau that
within ten days he would begin an action
to oust him from office. Chaigneau at
once prepared and submitted his resigna
tion, and took the first train this morn
ing for somewhereâ presumably San
Francisco. '
The District Attorney has urged Judge
Ham to call a special grand jury to in
vestigate the action of the City Trustees
and other city officers, as well as some
sensational statements relative to the in
sane asylum located near here. Judge
Ham has not signified his intention rela
tive thereto.

ON THE BANKS OF THE BLYDE, IN THE TRANSVAAL.
From a sketch made by J. Harrington.
It Is through the valley of the Blyde that the only road leads from Natal to the Lydenburg district. This road was
strongly fortified by the Boers during the last war with redoubts and rifle pits improvised out of the loose stone which
abounds along the river banks. In the distance to the left is the site of the battle fought between the British and Boers
at Langs Neck, which resulted so disastrously to the former.
ROOSEVELT FOR
VICE-PRESIDENT
Named as McKinley's
Running Mate.
â * â
Social Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â Among poli
ticians here it is deemed certain that
Theodore Roosevelt will not be the Re
publican candidate for Governor of
New York next year. Yet a few weeks
ago, no one doubted his renomination.or
that he would be re-elected by a larger
plurality than he received last fall.
j But in some way, how authoritative it is
impossible to discover, it seems to have
been reported to the greater politicians
in both parties that Vice President
Hobart will not a candidate for renom-
Ination. The report is that his physi
claps have advised him to wholly ab
stain from business or political pur
suits, and to devote himself, for a year
or two, to regaining his health.
It is probable that if the decision were
left to the Republicans New York State
would far prefer Governor Roosevelt
be nominated for Governor than for
Vice President. But the news comes
here from other parts of the country
and especially from the Western States,
where the Republican party's strength
is greatest, indicating that the party
will demand Roosevelt's nomination for
Vice President, and if the demand Is
made in a manner which now seems
probable Governor Roosevelt cannot re
fuse to heed it. In fact he will not re
fuse to heed it. This has been made so
plain by the Governor that politicians
have already, begun casting about for
timber for his successor, taking for
granted that he will be McKinley's run
ning mate in 1900.
From Michigan, through influential
â¢ citizens of Detroit, comes the news that
the retirement of Secretary Alger from
the Cabinet was expedited and tactfully
compassed through the advice and aid
of Governor Roosevelt. Exactly how
it was done Is not known. That, at
least, is the view taken by Michigan
men who have recently talked with Sec-
I retary Alger, and while it was not so
! stated, nevertheless the inference was a
j natural one from what was said that
' the first information of this came from
I General Alger himself.
Judge Joseph J. Willett of Alabama.
! who is credited with originating the
i Van Wyck boom, sent a sensational
telegram to Saratoga to-day to the ef
fect that Richard Croker should not be
taken into the conference with South
â¢ crn men, and that if the boss was al
lowed to affiliate Judge Willett would
have nothing to do with it upon his
arrival here Monday. !
COLONEL RAY RULES IN
CAPE NOME DISTRICT
Miners Will Submit to His Decisions
Until the Courts Are Heard
From.
SEATTLE, Aug. 10.â Colonel Ray and
the miners at Cape Nome understand
each other, and until the United States
Court decides whether or not powers of
attorney are legal and also untangles nu
merous other legal knots the soldiers will
be the dictators. Before leaving with his
expedition for the Yukon River, Colonel
Ray visited Cape Nome, and while there
had several conferences with the men
who were most active in getting up the
meeting that was dispersed by Lieutenant
Spauldlng several weeks ago. .
Colonel Ray Is said to have Informed
these men that actions tending to incite
disturbances of any kind would not be
tolerated and warned them that a re
currence of the trouble would prove very
serious to them. He said ha wanted to
be perfectly fair in the matter and treat
all men as American citizens, but he was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, AUGUST 11. 18HtÂ».
there to preserve order, and this he In- :
tended to do to the letter.
After stating their side of the contro
versy the men promised to aid the sol
diers in maintaining order in every man
ner possible. Colonel Ray, before going
up the river, let contracts for the build
ing of a post at Cape Nome to cost $16,000,
the barracks and quarters to be ready
for occupancy before winter sets in.
A meeting of miners was held July 15
at which a committee was appointed to
raise funds sufficient to carry on a full
Investigation of the law relating to pow
ers of attorney and also to investigate
the holding of claims by Laplanders. It
is alleged that the Laplanders are aliens,
and as such have no right to hold mining
claims in American territory.
THE SALMON SEASON
MAY BE EXTENDED
Fish Did Not Begin Running Until
Very Late and the Pack Is
Short.
ASTORIA. Or., Aug. 10.â The fishing
season closed at 12 o'clock to-day, but it
is quite probable that it will be extended.
The pack to date does not exceed 225,000
cases, the shortage being about 150,000
cases. As has been expected all along,
the run of fish was late, yesterday sal
mon began entering the river In immense
numbers, and this morning the canneries
and cold storages received as much fish
as they could handle. Six. cents a pound
was the prevailing price and fishermen
mad.- all the way from $25 to $120 on their
night's work.
Fish Commissioner Reed this morning
announced his intention of strictly en
forcing the law as to the. close season,
but several influential men, principal
among them State Senator Fulton, called
on him and asked him to allow fishing to
continue for a week or ten days more.
The State law does not permit the Com
missioner to make any extension, but no
one but the Commissioner has the power
to stop fishing. Mr. Reed said he was in
favor of extending the season but that
he wished to have the support of Gov
ernor Geer, who is a member of the Fish
Commission. Mr. Fulton drafted a mes
sage to Governor Geer, representing that
owing to the late spring and continued
high water the pack was short and that
unless an extension were granted there
would be distress among the fishermen.
The telegram was signed by the editors
of three daily papers, Mayor Bergman
and the entire legislative delegation.
It is stated on good authority that the
Washington State Fish Commissioner will
Allow fishing to continue on his side of
the river for a week and it is probable
that Governor Geer will express himself
as in favor of the plan. A week's fishing
means a quarter of a million dollars
to Astoria.
TWO ACTING BRITISH
CONSULS AT APIA
Major Muir, Who Was Appointed by
Lord Ranfurly, Will Probably
Resign.
VICTORIA, B. <'.. Aug. 10.â There are
two acting British Consuls at Apia, and
each one does not know what to do'be
cause of the other. The peculiar state of
affairs arose from the fact that one was
appointed at Auckland and the other at
| Suva.
When Lord Ranfurly of New Zealand
i was asked by C. N. E. Eliot to appoint
I an acting Consul for Samoa he at once
; sent Major Muir and three days after his
appointment 'the major left for Apia.
On his arrival he found that four days
â  prior to his coming the Tutanehi had
| met and installed Hamilton Hunter of
Fiji as acting Consul. It seems that at the
same time .'is Mr. Eliot requested Lord
Ranfurly to make the appointment he
also sent a request to the High Commis
sioner of the Western Pacific at Fiji, and
that officer appointed Hunter, who was
taken to Apia by H. M. S. Torch. Major
Muir will probably go back to New Zea
land.
MUCH ANXIETY FOR
THE INDIANAPOLIS
SEATTLE, Aug. 10.â report from
Dawson says advices received there

The steamer is reported to have
passed out of the Yukon into Bering

The last advices received at Seattle
from St. Michael came to-night on the
steam whaler Jeanie. Her captain re
ports that he heard of no disaster to
the Indianapolis. In fact, he heard "of
no such vessel and it is very probable
that she reached her destination safely.

LOST BARK MIDAS
IS HEARD FROM
Last Message Found in
a Floating Bottle.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Aug. 10.â What has
every appearance of being a genuine
message from the lost bark Midas was
found floating in the breakers off Stot's
Place, about four miles north of the Co
lumbia River Tuesday-. The slip of
paper was found in a bottle and as far
as it could be Interpreted by handwrit
ing experts the message reads as fol
lows:
"Brit, bark Midas, ballast shifted, all
in small boats, first mate's boat cap
sized, will all drown â â "
The Midas sailed from Nagasaki for
Portland in January, 1898, with a crew
of twenty-five men under charter to C.
W. Tracy to load wheat. Soon after
leaving the Japan coast a heavy storm
swept over that region, and two other
ships which afterward reached Port
land narrowly escaped foundering.
On receipt of the message the signa
ture was compared with that of Cap
tain Messenger on his clearance papers
at the Custom House. The resemblance
Is so striking as to leave small room
for doubt as to it's being made by the
captain of the lost Midas.
YUBA WILL SUE ITS
FORMER SUPERVISORS
Will Seek to Recover Moneys Alleged
to Have Been Illegally Ex
pended.
MARYSVILLE. Aug. in.â A resolution
'was adopted by tin- Board of Supervisors
of Yuba County to-day employing Forbes
& Carlin as attorneys to begin suit
against John C. White et als, to recover
moneys alleged to have been illegally
withdrawn by them from the treasury
of the county of Yuba and dispensed in
connection with , the work of the State
Debris Association.
The sum sought to be recovered will
reach $7000. A suit is also to be brought
against T. J. Sherwood to recover moneys
alleged to have been embezzled by him
while County Clerk of Yuba County some
years since in connection with the mail
of collecting fees in estates of deceased
persons, which he converted to his own
purposes.
As a result of the deliberations of the
recent Grand Jury, based on the report
made by an expert who had overhauled
the county books for the past three years,
suits were begun to-day by the District
Attorney against ex-Supervisor Atkinson
and bondsmen to recover $707 55 and costs;
Supervisor K. McGuire, $1230 60 and costs;
Supervisor Louis Conrath, $v>7 79 and
costs; Supervisor A. < '. Irwin, $358 60 and
costs, and against Supervisor W. J. Mel
lon, $770 84 and costs. The suits are
brought to recover moneys alleged to
have been drawn from the county treas
ury, in many cases after having been duly
"O K'd" by the District Attorney, in con
nection with road work and said to be in
excess of any amount that might properly
have been allowed in any one year, the
total for three years so overdrawn being
represented by the suits now filed. The
suit against Supervisor Irwin contem
plates the recovery of moneys expended
by him attending meetings of the State
Debris Association, running over a period
of three years, to the treasury of which
association Yuba County has been a sub
scriber to the amount of $200 per month
during said time, Irwin having been dele
gated by the Board of Supervisors to at
tend the deliberations of the association as

able books stolen from the library, which

NO MONEY FOR GRACE-
There Is No Appropriation in the Tax
Levy to Pay Morgue Matron
- Hasris.
Mrs. Grace D. Harris, who has been the
efficient matron of the Morgue ever since
Dr. Hill assumed the duties of Coroner,
was informed yesterday by Supervisor
Perrault that the city would not pay her
for her services in July owing to the fact
that by reason of the dollar limit there
was no appropriation for a Morgue mat
ron, neither for past nor for future ser
vices. This leaves the Morgue without
a matron and the duties of that official
must be divided among Deputies McCor
mick, Sullivan, Flanagan, Smith, Gately,
Lacombe, Mogan and Wolfe. . â¢

JANNSEN
TO FORM A
NEW PARISH
His Plan for Ending the
X Difficulties in the Belle
ville Diocese.
LETTER FROM KIEL!
â â¢ â
The Aged Pastor of Holy Angels'
Church Advises the Bishop on
the Best Course to Pursue.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â A special to
the Herald from Belleville, 111., says:
Bishop Jannsen, who excommunicated
700 Irish parishioners of St. Patrick's
Church, East St. Louis, is done with
that congregation and will organize an
other church. This information, com
ing from sources close to the Bishop, is
said to be his method of solving the
church war now. on in the Belleville
diocese.
A hall will be rented until a perma
nent church, which will be named ; St.
; Patrick's, is built. Vicar General Cluse,
: who has been appointed rector of St.
Patrick's, will be In charge of the new
congregation.
Rev. Father Kielty, pastor of Holy
Angels' Church, St. Louis, and one of
the oldest priests in that archdiocese, |
wrote a letter to Bishop Jannsen re- j
cently, urging him to desist from his j
position. The letter was made public J
to-day and is as follows:
Bishop Jannsen, Belleville, 111.â Dear j
Bishop: Proprio motu 1 send you this
friendly suggestion. I see from the morn
! ing papers that no satisfactory conclusion
has been reached between you and the
â¢ trustees*. There axe two proverbs which
say, "Past counsel, past grace," and, "It
I is the part of the wise man sometimes to
' change, but the fool never."
Fleury says: "Such heed was paid to
the assent of the people in the first six
ages of the church that if they refused
to accept a Bishop even after his conse
cration they were not constrained, and an
other more acceptable was provided."
Disc. 1, sec. 4, St.' Augustine gives rea
son addressed in these words to his peo
ple: "Wo are Christians for our own
salres, Bishops for yours." Now, here is
my â¢ friendly suggestion. Have Father
j Cluse decline the place on the ground of
I the congregation's great dlslik*. to him i
' and appoint Father Downey administra-
I tor indefinitely. In doing this you will
put a stop to the already terrible scandal.
i By acting thus you will uphold your au
[ thority. This course of action will neither
lower," weaken nor dishonor your episcopal
dignity. On 'the contrary, it will greatly
elevate It before the religious and non
religious world.
We depend on the people not only for
: our own support but also for the accom
; plishment of those works that develop the
| action of the church. In other countries
the clergy calculate on the benefactions of
a rich and generous aristocracy. In this
I our reliance is on the people, properly so
called. We cannot therefore afford to
alienate their affections. If we do so they
[ may not only withdraw their support from
the church but they may league them
i selves with our natural enemies.
Take down your books, my dear Bishop,
I and there read of the terrible and inter
! minable scandals caused by the trustees
in New York and Philadelphia, What has
j happened may happen again. You are
familiar with the language of our divine
Lord, "Vac homini illi per quern scandal
urn venit."
Totus tuns in Domino, F. M. KIELTY.
I The Latin phrases used in the letter are
translated as follows: "Pro prio motu"â
on my own initiative. "Vac homini illi
per quern scandalum venit" â Woe to
him through whom scandal originates.
"Totus tuns in Domino" â Yours entirely
in the Lord.

OUR HEROIC FIREMEN.
ON no field of battle was there ever displayed a
heroism more genuine than that exhibited by
the members of the Fire Department in res
cuing their comrades who were stricken down by the
falling roof of the Grand Central Market during the
fire on Wednesday night. Had such fidelity of com
radeship and such readiness to venture lite for the pur
pose of saving that of another been shown in a strug
gle of armies and amid the pomp and circumstance
of glorious war the deed would be renowned through
out the laud and there would have been universal
laudation, for the heroes.
Every incident of the occurrence attests the sterling
manhood of the heroes who were involved in the
catastrophe. Those who were crushed and maimed
were not less heroic than those who risked death to
save them. James McGivins, one of the first to be
rescued, was dragged from under -i rile of burning
timbers, with his hip broken and his face streaming
with blood from a scalp wound, but even in that suf
fering condition did not forget his fellow sufferers,
and while his rescuers were attending him he waved
them off and urged them to waste no time in minis
tering to him, but to save hi - comrades, who, like
him, had been caught in the ruins.
F.ugcne Crowe, while working in the burning
building for the rescue, was himself struck on the
head by a heavy piece of falling timber and badly
hurt. Yet he did not for a moment falter in his he
roic task. To the men who begged him to retire and
seek medical assistance for his hurt be replied, "I am
all right, boys, and I do not intend to leave here un
til I am satisfied there is no one else in the ruins."
Deeds like these ennoble humanity. They attest
that the quality of heroism docs not need the stimulus
of martial music, the excitement of battle, to rouse
it at the call of duty. True valor shows itself wher
ever needed and never fails in any emergency of life,
It is always in evidence in the hour and in the place
of danger, and its deeds arc as noble when performed
in some inconspicuous service as when acted out be
fore all the world on some great battle with the
muse of history standing ready to record it.
If the full story of American life could be written
it would disclose as many brave, self-sacrificing deeds
done in lighting fire as have been done in any other
department of American endeavor. Neither the ad
venturous leers who in the early days drove out
the savages and subdued the wilderness, nor the sol
diers who in war have won the victories of the re
public, nor the seamen who have carried our ships
over every stormy sea under the heavens, have been
more valiant or more faithful than the men who form
the fire service of our cities and protect us from dan
gers which the inflammable condition of many of Our
buildings render continually menacing.
V. ordinance has been introduced by the Town
Trustees of Alameda to compel the display after dark
of lamps on baby-buggies. This is not only objec
tionable on the ground that it is class legislation, but
he-cause it gives the impression that the beautiful
babes of Alameda are nighthawks.
A few months ago over at Oakland a young man
and a young woman, both blind, were married. Now
they have appealed to the Alameda Supervisors for
aid,- declaring they cannot see their way clear to exist
without public charily.
The Iksraad has resolved to send to the British

WEST POINT JEW BAITING.
CONGRESSMAN BROSIUS of Lancaster, Pi.,
chairman of the Committee on Claims, in a j
competitive examination appointed Sigmund
I Albert, a Jew, to a cadetship in West Point. Mr. Al- ,
! bert took his examinations successfully and ranked
well in his class, but has been compelled to resign
and go home by the ceaseless physical abuse put upon
him by the Christian cadets.
A Pleb at West Point must fight a few times. It
is a part of the mettle-trying process of the military j
school, and is winked at by the authorities. But when
a Pleb has proved his com in a couple of mills;
the prank*, and persecutions which compel him to fight '
1 usually cease. But in Albert's case there was no ces- j
j sation. He was tripped at drill, insulted and pursued,
and a regular conspiracy was entered into to wear him
out He is a young fellow of fine physique,, and if.]
the usual course had been pursued with him would j
have found no difficulty in sustaining the trying ex- j
periences common to the new cadets. But whether
he whipped or was whipped made no difference. He
fought some mills that sent him to the hospital, but j
in spite of the daily trial of his temper and courage j
he kept up with his lessons and classwork. Finally,
; when he was just out of hospital after a battle that
disabled him, he was set upon by an Irish cadet, and
; in his weakened state being incapable of a stout de- i
fense was brutally pounded into insensibility. After j
' being somewhat restored in the hospital, foreseeing |
that his several hundred persecutors could wear him !
out and cause his failure in class standing, he re
signed and went home. ;
Two other Jewish cadets, AfTel of New York and
Huntzler of Baltimore, have been driven out of West j
Point this year in the same way, though they do not J
seem to have sustained the unequal battle as long as j
Albert did. Congressman Brosius has been notified
of the resignation and vacancy, but has taken no
steps in the matter. As each of the three Jews who
have been driven out of the Academy won his ap
pointment in a competitive examination, scholastic
and physical, and was not the beneficiary of favorit
ism, the case is one of peculiar hardship. It is of in
terest to San Francisco, because a bright young Jew,
who has already seen military service, we believe, has
been appointed to West Point from Congressman
Kahn's district.
The recent distressing scandals in the French army,
which for a time threatened the stability of the re
public, had their origin in hatred of the Jews. Cap
tain Dreyfus is a Jew, and in the invention of a case
against him and the conspiracy to destroy him by for
gery and perjury the whole motive was racial and re
ligious. Unfortunately, the civil government of
France, aware of this conspiracy in military circles,
weakly cowered before the influence of the army and
by its cowardice nearly brought to pass a revolution
that would have reversed the political destiny of
France.
That a similar moral disease should become en
demic in the United States army must be more than
deplored. It must be prevented. There is no man- â 
hood, courage nor thing American and praise
worthy in such a combination of numbers as seems to
have been made against Cadet Albert. Among savage
Indians if the victim ran the gauntlet once and lived
his rights were respected and he had no further ordeal.
This honorable rule seems to be ignored at West
Point, and the numerous young men being educated
there for a salaried life at the expense of the tax
payers should be made to understand that such con
duct as is reported toward Cadet Albert is regarded
as cowardly and unmanly to the last degree.
The Jew cadet from San Francisco can see what i
ahead of him and should be prepared for it. It is
expect also, by all of our people, of all creeds,
that if a similar attack is made upon him Congress
man Kahn will initiate such investigation as will
demonstrate whether the military cadets of this coun
try arc to be permitted to class Jew--; and negroes to
gether and deny to both the right to the advantages
and training of the Academy. *
The Jews are numerically weak in this country,
numbering but little more than half a million in a
population of seventy-five millions. But the constitu
tion guarantees to them absolute equality of right be
fore the law. If there were but one Jew in the coun
try he should be as safe as if the armies of the princely
Maccabees were here to enforce his rights. We have
just made a finish of Spain, but her downfall began
when in the flush and high tide of power greater than
we now have she turned upon the Jew r in precisely the
same spirit that inspires the disgraceful and cowardly
acts of the West Point cadets.
Six firemen were injured Wednesday night at the
Grand Central Market lire. An advertising fence
that rears its ugly height twelve feet above the roof
was directly responsible for their injuries. By rea
son of the fact of its presence the firemen could not
work properly from the street and had to g<s into the
burning building. They were fortunate they were
not killed â no thanks to the owners of the advertis
ing fence. Similar accidents from similar causes. are
liable to occur at any fire. The Fire Commissioners
should take some means to preserve the lives of their
men. .
THE SIBERIAN RfIILROf.D.
CAPTAIN VASHIRO, a naval attache of the
Japanese legation at St. Petersburg, is reported
to have stated in a speech at a recent banquet
! at Tokio that in his judgment Russia will eventually
abandon the great undertaking of constructing a rail
: road across Siberia. He describes the difficulties in
the way as being well nigh insuperable. Siberia, he
says, suffers from severe cold weather for more than
half the year, yet the work of construction was hur
riedly pushed forward when the ground was frozen.
When warm weather came in the spring the ground
thawed and gaps were made in the line. At some
places the joints of the rails were broken.
There are many reasons why a Japanese would not
look favorably upon the Russian project. The wish
' is father to the thought, "and the statesmen and the
military officials of Japan most certainly wish Russia
I may never be able to provide a means for the rapid
-port of troops and military and naval stores
across Siberia to the Asiatic coast. It is quite prob
able, therefore, that the views of Captain Vashiro
have been colored and distorted to some extent by
; his national prejudices. *
That the road does not give satisfaction has long
j been known, but some investigators attribute the de
fects not so much to any insuperable difficulties of the
country traversed as to the negligent or fraudulent
i manner in which the contractors have done their
work. British papers have given much closer atten
tion to the work than our own, and the London Mail
recently quoted a St. Petersburg correspondent as
saying:
"In the first place, the different works have been
executed in a manner that shows very little con
-1 science. Even-thing, or nearly everything, will have
:to be done over again before the ' authorities cat
j think of throwing open this â¢ gigantic line to regular
| working. In very many places the road gives way

on the passage of a train a little heavier than usual
or traveling at a speed of more than twenty miles an
i hour, and accidents more or less grave are continually
! happening. More than usual courage is demanded oi
any one undertaking a journey on this railway. This
! construction a la Russe has already swallowed up hun
| dreds of millions of rubles, or, to speak more truth
| fully, the constructors and not the construction have
j absorbed the millions. People are beginning to ask
j how it will finish."
There is, however, another side to the story. Ac
| cording to reports made by American Consuls the
defects in the road are due solely to an unwise
j economy practiced in the original construction. . It
I was not foreseen that any great traffic would be car-
I ried on over the road, and consequently the roadbed
' and the rails are inadequate to the immense pressure j
j which has been put upon them. j
Some statistics of the traffic of the road are given
jby Consul General Holloway at St. Petersburg and
j are published in the Consular Reports for July.
; By these it is shown that the business of the road is
â  increasing with great rapidity. In .896 the western
\ section carried 160,000 passengers and 379.000,001)
; pounds of freight, while in 1898 the number of pas
i sengcrs had increased to 350,000 and the freight to
j over 1,000,000,000 pounds. The central section,
1 which in [896 carried 15,000 passengers and 36,000,000
J pounds of freight, carried in 1898 300,000 passengers |
I and 393,000,000 pounds of freight.
The extraordinary development of the traffic has
been too much for the ill-ballasted roadbed and the
light rails used in the construction of the road, and
accordingly travel over it is by no means pleasant or
speedy. There appears, however, to be nothing in the
situation to justify Captain Vashiro's prediction that
Russia will eventually abandon the undertaking. On
the contrary, Consul General Holloway reports that
heavier rails are being laid, sidetracks are being put
in, and $40,000,000 is to be expended in developing
the traffic by the construction of branch lines.
The authorities at Washington affect to think that
Commander St. John of 11. M. S. Peacock did not
know what he was talking about when he spoke dis
paragingly of General Otis. Come to think of it, the
Washington authorities may be correct. Otis is a
conundrum too deep for the average British intel
lect.
TflX SHIRKING EXTRAORDINARY.
TIN. so-called "war revenue law" was passed by
Congress in June one year ago. Among other
schemes for producing revenue it provided for
a tax of one cent upon each and every package trans
ported by inland railroad, steamboat and express
compani-S. The agents and employes of these cor
porations were required to affix to all receipts, bills
of lading, manifests or other evidences of the con
tract of carriage a revenue stamp of the denomination
stated, the cancellation of such stamp constituting the
payment of the tax.
All over the country the express companies un
patriotically refused to pay the tax. They took ad
vantage of an absurd ambiguity in the wording of the
statute to contend that the shipper and not they should
affix and cancel the stamp. One of the chief and most
insolent offenders in this regard was Wells, Fargo &
Co. of this city, whose illegitimate revenues from the
people of Californiaâ upon whom it has foisted the
payment of this taxâ been estimated at $10,000 a
month. In July of last year a suit was brought in the
Justices' Court against the company for damages. In
that case the Justices' and Superior Court in written
opinions held that the law plainly compels the express
companies to pay the tax. Judge Tuley of the Il
linois Circuit Court had previously made a similar
titling. Later in the year the Michigan Supreme
Court took the same view of the law. In fact, up to
date no respectable legal authority has been found to
declare that this tax-shirking corporation has a legal
leg to stand upon.
Shortly before the expiration of his term of office
Attorney General Fitzgerald applied to the Superior
Court of this city for a writ of mandate to compel
Wells, Fargo & Co. to stamp its receipts. The cor
poration promptly removed this proceeding to the'
Federal courts. After a long delay Attorney General
Ford argued the matter and Judge Morrow without
hesitation remanded the case. This was two months
ago. The Attorney General has not since been heard
from. Whether he has actually taken the proceeding
back to the State tribunal or whether he intends to
further prosecute it nobody knows. While the people
of California arc waiting for Mr. Ford to act, how
ever, they are being robbed by Wells, Fargo & Co. of
about $10,000 a month.
The Attorney General may not regard this as a
consequential matter, but we think he will discover
before long that, however trivial it may seem to him,
in the public eye it is a subject of momentous im
portance. If every man who patronizes Wells, Fargo
& Co., and who in consequence is held up for one
cent, can be made to realize that the robbery is per
petuated mainly through the neglect of the chief law
officer of the State to do his duty, Mr. Ford may find
later on that his inactivity from a political viewpoint
will be rather costly.
In October last two suits were brought against
Wells, Fargo & Co. by individuals named Johnson
and Bcnham, for damages. These actions have been
twice taken to the Federal courts by the corporation
and are now pending before Judge Morrow on mo
tions to return them to the State courts. On the
last occasion they were removed on grounds which
are a positive insult to the intelligence of the United
States Circuit Judge. In that proceeding Wells,
Fargo & Co. claims that it is a collector, instead of a
shirker, of Federal taxes, and that, therefore, it is
entitled to have its fleecing operations attended to by
the United States Circuit Courts. Judge Morrow
has once decided that he has no jurisdiction to try
actions brought against this express company in the
State courts unless the amount sued for exceeds
$2000, and yet, for the purpose of delaying litigation
and prosecuting its tax-shirking, the corporation
continues to abuse the process of the courts and in
sult the intelligence of the Judges.
But there is no excuse for the Attorney General.
It is his duty to bring this tax-shirker to terms, and
if he faithfully discharges it he can produce results
within a month. â¢ The question is not one of law, but
one of preventing delay.
The Mazet Committee, which is investigating cer
j tain robberies in the New- York tenderloin, thinks it
may find collusion between police and criminals. It
I would better look for it under some other name â
rake-off, for instance.

MINGLING DIVERGENT MANKIND.
Can the Contact of Two Races in
the Philippines Result Eeneiici
ally to Either?
i.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: The
position of your journal In opposing the
permanent retention of the Philippine Isl
ands by the United States Government
Is one that should commend Itself to the
pood sense and prudence of every Amer
ican who being; sincerely patriotic desires
the real and permanent welfare of his
nation, and not merely the tinsel glory
of defeating and subjugating a people
vastly inferior to our own in numbers,
wealth and civilization. Patriotism does
not mean that American citizens shall
be slavishly subservient to temporary
leaders or to official representatives, but
only that we shall honestly strive to ac
complish what we sincerely believe to.be
for the nation's greatest permanent good.
The problem involved in the subjuga
tion and retention of the Philippines is
not one of mere political partisanship. I
am now and have been for more than
twenty years an active member of the
Republican party, but I do not conceive
that it is my duty to defend or uphold
the tendencies of those members of ray
party who have advocated the acquisi
tion of new terrUory without careful con
sideration of the race, civilization and
general character of the people who in
habit it. In considering the problems
involved in what is termed "expansion,"
the people of the United States should
rise above mere partisan polities, for the
result of their consideration and action
may have in the end a tremendous in
fluence upon the future of the nation, ;
and upon the happiness of the existing
population, or at least upon the welfare
Of their immediate successors.
The problem of the Philippines may he
discussed from various standpoints. I
have selected for consideration in this
series of articles one feature of the ques
tion which Is usually overlooked, but
which seems to me to be more important
than those which customarily attract at
tention, and less capable of being dif
puted than other objections which are
made to the retention of the Islands. I
allude to' the intermingling of races be
tween which there exists no desire for
nor expectation of Intermarriage as <_
normal social condition, and to the evil
results arising therefrom.
A little reflection should teach any ob
f-ervant person, especially if he be famil
iar with history, that the non-existence
of marriage between any two classes of
people inevitably acts as an insuperable
obstacle to completely harmonious rela
tions. The most virulent hatred may at
first exist' between two families, tribes,
clans, factions, nations or even races, but
if it does not extend so far as to prevent
marriages among the young people tr.
evil prejudices will disappear In a few
generations and a complete amalgamation
will be effected. The opposing^ clans be
come one people- brought together by the
kindly efforts of Cupid among the young
men and women. The consolidation of
the Normans and Saxons In England is
a notable instance of this principle, and
the early history of Europe is full of in
stances where ; nations have been built
in this way from association and inter
marriage between distinct tribes that
originally hated one another with a oitter
nesa comprehensible only to a barbarian
of that period. , -^-..-a.
On the other hand, history also records
abundant instances of the other proposi
tion that so long as intermarriage is for
any reason not permissible the hostility
cannot disappear, although it may be les
sened as the entire people progress in
that tolerance which is a dlstingul
feature of real civilization. Ihe history
Of the Jews forms probably the most m
' teresting commentary of this condition.
I They are of the Caucasian race and they
have lived almost exclusively among Cau
casians for centuries. They refuse to in
termarry with their associates - however,
i and for centuries, notwithstanding Â»aen
tity of language, race and color, they have
; been hated and persecuted. To-day in an
parts of the world the Jews as a class are
disliked and wherever they become very
numerous they are persecuted. .1 he ill
! will toward them exists not because or
any defects in their character, but it is
the instinctive hostility which formerly
existed between all clans and which can
: be entirely removed only by marriage and
the complete amalgamation which results.
I In preserving their existence as a distinct
people the Jews have also perpetuated
the hatred against them, and both are
due to the same cause â their refusal to
intermarry with other people.
The results arising from the contact of
different races proceeds along these lines.
If there exist between two races in con
tact no original antipathy which prevents
intermarriage, hostility and ihe evils
which arise from it are temporary, and a
mongrel population soon arises in testi
mony of permanent declarations of peace.
if antipathy to marriage exists no amal
gamation can occur and the condition is
one of oppression or warfare. One race
must subjugate the other or exterminate
It.
Of all the branches of the Caucasian
race which have been brought into Inti
mate association with other races the
people of Northern and Central Europe,
usually termed the Anglo-Saxons, and
their descendants have proved to be the
least fitted for any approach to amalga
mation. In all parts of the world their
approach to the darker races has meant
extermination or political slavery under
the name of military domination. The
Latin branches of the race have shown a
slightly greater degree of adaptability to
amalgamation, involving a corresponding
degree of harmony, and It is a well known
fact in our history that the French and
Indians or Spanish and Indians were in
variably allied against our forefathers of
Anglo-Saxon descent. The Anglo-Saxons
and their descendants have always exhib
ited toward the lower races a harsh and
unsympathetic character. There is not
the slightest tendency toward the tolera
tion which has sometimes developed from
contact of the Latins with these races,
and the intermarriage of our people with
other races as a general social result is
not a thing that can occur unless existing
standards of morality are abrogated. We
have enslaved Inferior races, we have ex
terminated them, but wo have never in
termarried with them.
The people of the United States have re
ceived in their comparatively brief his
tory as a nation three great lessons in
these sociological principles, and the
memory of the teaching should have im
pressed them seriously. They were given
to us in blood and tears and groans; in
sin and sorrow; in excruciating physical
pain, in moral degradation, and in all
that makes intelligent human beings
ashamed of their own existence.
The first of these lessons is the miser
able record of cur Indian wars from the
time North America was colonized by
Europeans, it is a record of cruel tor
ture and pillage on the part of the In
dians in their efforts to drive away the
hated invaders, and of merciless revenge
and destruction by the more powerful
race. It is a story of women and children
brained and scalped, of white men burned
alive and of Indiana shot down with less
regret than if they had been wolves. It
Is a story that is now nearly completed
by the approaching extermination of
the Indians as tribal organizations and
the aDSorption of the few remnants into
the great body of our population. And
it is one that all of us would gladly ex
punge from the records of the nation if
we could blot out â¢ the history of our
shame in that way.
I shall avoid discussing the moral fea
tures of our Indian problem, now almost
solved by the rapidly approaching ex
termination of the tribe.-, Our ances
tors were most certainly robber hordes
invading the territory occupied by
the Indians and driving them from
It. The history of the world is
merely the repetition of similar aggres
sion, ."the weak giving way to the strong
on every hand.
The extirpation of the Indians, contrary
as it is to all the morality embodied in
Christ's teachings, may be defended by
the plea that the pressure of European
population drove our ancestors Into Amer
ica No such theory can apply to the col
onization of the Philippines by the people
of the United States. If we persist in tne
effort to mingle the white race of this
country with the brown men of these
islands we will deliberately incur all the
evils that have resulted from our contact
with the Indian tribes and bring unneces
sarily upon ourselves and our descend
ants the curses that invariably arise out
of such association. The resources of the
United States are abundantly able to sup
port a much greater population than the
country now maintains: the de-sity of
population in the Philippines is nearly
four times as great as that of our own
country; and even if we admit that it is
desirable at times to secure new terri
tory regardless of the wishes of occu
pants, that desirability does not appear In
the pre! instance. The opinion of cur
volunteer soldiers who have returned ap
pears to be almost unanimous that "the
game is not worth the candle."
The worth or worthlessness of the Phil
ippines, however, will make no difference
in the evil results that are sure to follow
our occupancy and possession of the
Islands because the race contact cannot be
avoided. Had the aborigines of North
America been of the Caucasian race or
had no antipathy toward marriage with
the Indians existed among the whites
when the country was colonized the evil
results of continuous brutal warfare
would not have occurred. Amalgamation
would have resulted in America as it did

BUFFALO. N. V.. Aug. 10.â The four
day card of the Buffalo Driving Club
was completed at the Fort Erie track
to-day, although with the brisk half-hour
shower and the match affairs the Grand
Circuit performers were kept busy until
nearly 8 o'clock. The shower sprang up
as the horses were called for the third
heat of the Queen City trotting stake
and it made the track heavy and sticky.
The stake was a hotly contested affair.
At the start it looked like a battle con
fined to Surpol. the Electricity horse, and
the Village farm's The Queen. However.
both Surpol and The Queen fell by the
wayside and the winner appeared in
Lord Vincent, which won a hard race
very easily in the sixth heat. It was a
terrific upset and thousands were lost on
The Queen and Surpol. Coney took the

THE COLOMBIA
IS BEATEN BY
THE DEFENDER
Race Over a Rough
Sea.
â â¢ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Aug-. 10.â
The old Defender practically won a race
against the Columbia to-day if time al
lowance was given, in the dirtiest sort
of weather for a yacht club cruise. But
the victory, it must be admitted, was
more than well earned, and the yachts
men of the New York Club and their
guests never saw beforeâ and may never
see again for yearsâ such a sailing event.
The margin between the famous sloops
was fourteen seconds over a minute in
the thirty-seven mile run from Brentotns
Reef lightship, off Newport, to the West
Chop buoy in Vineyard Sound, with a
change in the course nt Vineyard Sound
lightship, seventeen and a quarter miles
from the start.
The- race between the Columbia and the
Defender was fairly soul-stirring. After
both got away over the starting line it
was nip and tuck with cased sheets for
almost an hour, the Defender just a hair's
breadth, comparatively speaking, in the j
lead, with the Columbia abeam. Even af
ter the Columbia made a gain so that (he .
Defender could cross under her stern the
Columbia did not walk away, as the heavy
breeze hove the latter clown and made her j
lose distance on repeated luffs.
The fleet got away from Newport with
miserable weather prospects. Rain fell
I through the entire day and the southerly
fifteen-knot wind brought in a wringing
wet mist from seaward.
The Defender crossed the line at 11::20:10
and the Columbia at 11:20:40. The Colum
bia at once bore down on the Defender's
weather quarter, but could not get by her,
and for fifteen miles the boats sailed side
by side. Just before reaching the light
ship both boats set jib topsails, and three
strong puffs knocked both boats well
down, Columbia being forced to luff each
time. From the lightship to the finish,
nearly twenty miles, the boats ran some
what more off the wind and the Columbia
drew away from the Defender, finishing
one minute and four seconds ahead.
To-day's race and the performance of
the Columbia was satisfactory on the
score of heavy weather. She took all
that came, and. while eased up several
times, that was no evidence that she
would have had too much of a good
thing if a stake were pending on the out- i
come of the race.
All the other boats found that the;
weather was boisterous enough for the
time being and some of the schooners
fairly flew through the water. The sloop
i Vigilant, which headed the fleet, finished
first, with the Navahoe second and then
i came the two big racers. Ail the craft
finished In a nastly squall, which made
: the turn at the west Chop buoy particu-
I larly exhilarating for all hands.
To-night the. feet rides at alienor in the
I harbor, with turbulent waters under
i neath and plenty of wind whistling
1 through the rigging overhead. To-mor
row most of the boats will sail over to
; New Bedford, but the Columbia and De
: fender will probably pass by Buzzards
i Bay and continue to Newport.

THE SAX AN CISCO CALL,, FRIDAT, AUGUST ,11/ 1899.
BLEND ORATORY
AND BOXING AT
EXCELSIOR CLUB
Good Bouts Between
Amateurs.
â â
A brace of good boxing bouts, an ex
hibition by Joe Kennedy and Spider Kelly
and a lot of oratory made up the enter
tainment provided by the Excelsior Ath
letic Club last night. The oratory devel
oped over the refusal of Billy Hoskins
and Charley Vickers to put on the gloves
until the purse of $35 was placed In the
hands of the referee.
Secretary Friedlander explained that
the club's guarantee that the money
would be forthcoming was sufficient, clos
ing with the statement that boxers would
not be allowed to dictate how matters
should be run. The seconds of the men
had their innings and after a lot of good
natured badinage from the spectators
the men stripped for the fray. It was
found the referee had the money all the
time.
The bout went the limit, eight rounds,
and was awarded to Vickers. Throughout
tie- entire time, and some of the rounds
lasted seven minutes, he kept jabbing
lloskir.. in the face until it glowed .ike
a summer sunset. Early in the bout it
seemed Hoskins could not last, but he
kept gamely at his task.
The best bout of the evening was be
tween "Kid" Hogan and Neil Callahan.
The former won suddenly In the third
round. He had his opponent tired and
just as they clinched he landed a hard
right over Callahan's heart. The latter
hung limply for a moment and then slid
to the Boor, where he was counted out.
Both proved good boxers, hitting cleanly.
The three rounds between Kennedy and
his mentor, Kelly, were fast. Kennedy
had taken on a lot of flesh since his meet
ing with Ruhlin, but proved remarkably
fast with both hands and feet. The in
imitable Kelly thought the first round too
long and called "time" on it himself.

The Game Chicago Rider Beats Good
son, the Australian, by Nearly
Four Miles at the
Finish.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTREAL. Aug. 10. â Beautiful
weather and a crowd of 5000 people greet
ed the second day of the world's bicycle
meet. The racing was of a better order,
the management giving pacemakers
places in the semi-finals. On account of
the lime occupied in disposing of the 100
--kilometer the five-mile amateur handicap
was postponed until to-morrow, when it
will be run oil as part of an extra day's
race.
There were two world's championships
on the card, the 100-kilometer race and
the mile professional. The former race
was a gift for the Chicago rider, John A.
Nelson, who had no difficulty in winning,
beating Goodson, the Australian, by
nearly four miles and Riddle of Winni
peg, the only other finisher, by seven
miles. Cherry, the English champion,
who won at Vienna last year, was
scratched, having injured his leg by run
ning against the fence yesterday. Nel
son had much the better of the pace with
a steam motor, a triplet and a tandem,
and he evidently had the most experience
in following pace. Goodson's pacing by a
triplet and a tandem was good, while Rid
dle practically had no pace at all. Two
other men started, but dropped out before
many miles had been covered. It was easi
ly seen that records were going to fall
when Nelson rode the first five miles in
9:31. and he kept on reeling off miles at
a two-minute gait until he had the ama
teur record in the distance.
Major Taylor had little difficulty in add
ing the mile professional championship
to his laurels. All the preliminary heats
were marked by good finishes except that
won by the major, who easily won. The
most interesting were the third, in which
Nat Butler cleverly disposed of R. Mc-
Carthy of St. Louis, and the fourth, in
which Angus McLeod, the fastest of the
Canadians, disposed of Bowler of Chicago
in a rattling finish.
In the final Nat Butler took the lead at
the start. Major Taylor dropping into last
place. The pace was slow. On the back
stretch in the second round there was
some pretty maneuvering for place and
when it was over the major had dropped
Into the position he wanted, second, with
Butler leading. The men began riding
at the three-quarters. McLeod went to
the front with a rush and attempted to
make a runaway of it, but the others
were not to be denied. When they round
ed into the stretch McLeod was still lead
ing, with the others well bunched be
hind him. Half way down the stretch
the major had the race well in hand and
a great fight was on between Tom and
Nat Butler and McLeod. Fifty feet from
the wire McLeod wilted under the terrific
pace, while Tom Butler beat Nat out by
a half wheel to the wire, the major win
ning by a wheel.
Moran of Chelsea, Mass., won the two
mile amateur from Caldow, the Scotch
man, coming out of the bunch at the
head of the stretch and winning by a
wheel. Peabody got into a pocket on the
turn Into the stretch and gave up the
race.
The Landow pursuit race was easy for
the Butlers. Summary:

LARGEST FINE EVER IMPOSED.
! Market Men Pay Dearly for Selling
Game Out of Season.
The market men who violate the law
by selling, game out of season received
a great setback yesterday at the hands
of Police Judge Treadwell. A week or
so ago Henry Mitchell, head salesman
for O'Brien & Spotomo in the California
Market, was arrested by Deputy C. A.
Vogelsang for having a lot of mallards,
teals and other ducks in his possession
out of season.
Many of the ducks were so young that
even the pin leathers had not disappeared.
It is doubtful if ever a case of violating
game laws has been before a Police Jung;
where there was so much influence
brought to bear as in this. When the j
1 man was convicted every conceivable er- .
fort was made to have the Judge impose ,
the smallest fine, which is $20. f âââ.
When the Judge pronounced sentence
he stated that the "pull" and the push |
had done everything possible to get. the,
fellow let off lightly, and even one of Ins,
brother Judges had come down from the
bench to influence the judgment. judge
. Treadwell said that if the market hunt-
' ers are encouraged to violate the law by
the market men it will be only a short
time before all of cur native ducks and
other game will be exterminated, rue
only way to put a stop to this unlawful

LIPMAN GETS JUDGMENT.
Southern Pacific Railroad Company-
Fails in a Land Contract.
Some time aero Louis Lipman bought a
tract of land from the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, the property being a
part of the main line grant between Mo
jave and the Needles, the price being $400.
Lipman was guaranteed a title as soon
as the final payment had been made, and
as he had about completed his part of the
contract he begun to look for a title. As
it was not forthcoming with the desired
speed he brought suit before Justice of
the Peace Dunn to recover the amount
paid the company. Judge Dunn gave
judgment for the plaintiff on the ground
that the company had not used due dili
gence to procure a patent from the Gov
ernment, and thus the purchaser had been
left without protection. The matter was
appealed to the Superior Court, and yes
terday Judge Seawell affirmed the dcci- ;
sion. It is said that the company has sold
land amounting to a big figure on the
same lines, and the decision will force it
to return many thousands of dollars.

Wonderful Case of Joseph Smith,
Who Gained 24 Pounds in Three
Weeks Under Dr. Aborn's
Treatment at 554 Sut-
ter Street.
In the treatment of chronic diseases of
the 3tomach, liver, bladder and kidneys,
as well as of the eye, ear, head, throat
and mngs, Dr. Aborn of 554 Sutter street
is a recognized authority. A remarkable
cure recently effected by him was brought
to the attention of a reporter a few days
ago. The patient was Joseph Smith,
whose statement is given herewith in
full:
"I was for two years sorely afflicted," said
Mr. Smith, "with an obstinate chronic disease
that completely broke down my health so that
I had given up ail hope of ever getting well.
I tried several doctors without any benefit. I
persevered under one doctor's treatment for a
whole year without benefit. My stomach,
liver, kidneys and bladder were affected and
life was a burden to me In this miserable con-
dition. In this seemingly hopeless state of
; health I applied to Dr. Aborn. just three weeks
I ago and he has cured me as though by magic,
so speedily and thoroughly lias his treatment
! acted in my case. I improved from the first
day's treatment and I have gained just twenty-
four pounds in three weeks under Dr. Aborn's
modern system of treatment. I look and feel
! like a new man. I make this statment for the
benefit of the afflicted, that they may know
Dr. Aborn effects speedy and permanent cures
! after all others have failed. The facts I cheer-
fully attest to under oath."
Dr. Aborn's phenomenal success is well
known on the American continent for the
past thirty years. Instantaneous relief
and permanent cures are often effected at
the first personal consultation, especially
in such cases as have for years or a life-
time resisted the ordinary modes of prac-
tice.

Reported to Be Raising a

-I TEW YORK, Aug. John Ja- 1
\ cob Astor is to lead in battle in
\ the Philippine Islands a com
-L " pany he has equipped, so a tele
graphic dispatch from Newport
received here says. The authority for
this report could not be obtained. Colo
nel Astor Is not at Newport, and his |
house here is closed. Neither was he
at the Waldorf- Astoria, but it was said
there he was at Rhinebeck. The re
port has plausibility, since John Jacob
Astor was one of the most ardent vol- \
unteers in the war against Spain. He j
fought in Cuba, but he had not the
honor of leading in person in the Phil
ippines his efficient Astor Battery.
POL'GHKEEPSIE, N. V., Aug. 10.â j
A Rhinebeck man was in town to-day
with a story to the effect that he saw- |
Colonel John Jacob Astor at Femcliffe !
and interviewed, him on his reported j
intention of going to the Philippines j
with a military company of his own
raising. In reply Colonel Astor Is j
quoted as saying he takes great inter
est in the development of the Philippine j
Islands, and if the War Department j
should express a desire for him to go
there he would willingly leave home.
and friends at any time to answer his
country's call.
Colonel Astor is further quoted as
Baying that he deplored the action of
his cousin, William Waldorf Astor, in I
forfeiting his American citizenship to
become a naturalized Briton, and to
have accentuated his own pride of
country by the remark: "I have the
blood in me of my grandmother, who
â was the sister of Colonel Henry B.
Armstrong and the daughter of General j
Armstrong. They were true Ameri
cans."
OTIS TO REMAIN IN
SUPREME COMMAND!
Decision Beached by President Mc-
Kinley and Secretary
Boot.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Aug. 10.â
Major General Otis will remain in su
preme command pf the Philippine Islands.
Should he request to be relieved, Major
General I.awton will be assigned to duti
as his successor. I am informed by high
authority that this is the decision reached
by the President and Secretary Root dur
ing their several conferences at Lake ;
Champlairi. Secretary Root made no se- ,
cret to-day of the intention of the Presi
dent to retain General Otis in control at j
Manila and so informed General Miles at ;
a lengthy conference during which the
Philippine situation was discussed. It is
evident that notwithstanding General;
Merritt's expressed desire to return to ;
Manila he will not have the opportunity,
and even General Lawton's promotion Is
conditional upon the request of General
Otis to he detached from his present com
" l learned to-day that former Secretary
A leer just hefore his retirement, recom
mended that General Otis be relieved, on
the ground tnat he had not proved himself
equal to the emergency.
Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed
by the friends of the administration at |
the decision of â :.. President to leave Gen
eral Otis to continue his ineffectual strug-
Ele to suppress the insurrection; but it
was .aid to-day that Mr. McKinley de
sired to give him a chance to show what
he could do with 60,000 effective troops.
General Miles favors the dispatch of ad
ditional cavalry to bring the total up to
10 000 but I was informed this afternoon
that 'Secretary Root had no intention at
present of adopting the recommendation,
though he holds himself ready, if neces- :
fc arv to order additional troops to Manila.
The operations which General Mac A
rthur has been conducting to the north
ward of San Fernando have a double pur
pose in viewâ first, the demoralization
of the insurgents and to prevent them
strengthening the positions they hold and
prepare themselves for a fall campaign; j
and second, for the purpose of establish-
Ing himself at a point on a railway con
necting the Gulf of Lingayen with Manila.
General iwton's recent demonstration!
to the southward of Manila and the appar
ently desultory operations of the troops i
generally are all based upon General Otis' |
plan to "keep the Insurgents in constant
fear of attack, in order that they may
have no opportunity to get into condition I
for operations which will begin in No
vember.
The efforts being made by Aguinaldo to ,
prevent natives deserting to the Ameri
cans are illustrated by letters captured by
General Otis, showing that the insurgents
are being â¢ exhorted to hold out a little
longer, and they are promised that Euro
pean recognition will be obtained and the;
McKinley administration overthrown by
August 31_
Cable reports received several weeks ago
from the Philippine Commission showed
that Aguinaldo was confronting grave
diflicultv in preventing desertions to the;
American side, the general feeling among
the natives being one of despondency.
High officials of the administration are
not at all discouraged over the situation, i
as they say the dispatch of additional
troops to Manila in itself will show the ;
natives that the reports that this Gov
ernment proposes to abandon the islands ;
are without foundation and that it is in- 1
tended by the President to restore peace '
and order in the islands.
THE OLD CONTROVERSY
WILL NOT STAY DOWN
Secretary Root and General Miles
Contend for Author
ity.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 10.âSecre
tary Root has inherited the old contro
versy as to the power of the major gen
eral In command of the army, and, owing
to the strained relations between Secre
tary Alger and General Miles, the new
Secretary is forced to take up this ques
tion in the very beginning of his admin
istration.
General Miles called upon the Secretary
mi? morning loaded with authorities rela
tive to the recognition of the commanding
general in the management and discipline
of the army _<nd sought to convince Sec
retary Root that his predecessor, Secre
tary Alger, had Issued an order that
should not be promulgated regarding the
inspector general's department. This order
prepared by Secretary Alger the day be
fore he left the office, recognized the in
spector general's department as Just what
the statute makes Itâ bureau of the
War Department and the inspector gen
eral a member of the staff, who shall re
port directly to the Secretary of War.
General Miles contended that the in
spection of the army had always been
subject to the orders of the major general
In command, and he cited authorities
bearing him out in that contention.
Secretary Root heard General Miles' ar
gument and then sent for Assistant Sec
retary Meiklejohn and Inspector General
Breckenridge in turn. The Assistant Sec
retary presented the law passed by Con
gress creating the staff, and showed that
the Inspector general was like the ad
jutant general, commissary general and
quartermaster general, a staff officer to
the Secretary of War. The law creating
bureaus of the War Department makes no
difference between these.
The Assistant Secretary could, however,
find no statutory authority in regard to
the commanding general. There is no
law of Congress touching the command
ing general. He is simply the senior ma
jor general assigned to command by the
President, who is Commander-in-Chief of
the army.
On the issue by General Miles for juris
diction over the inspector general's de
partment, through the technicality of an
old regulation, it was explained that this
was only a department in name. It is a
bureau, like others in the War Depart
ment, and differs in no respect from other
bureaus in being under the direction of
the Secretary of War. The inspector gen
eral is a staff officer of the Secretary of
War.
It is evident Secretary Root desires to
give General Miles what recognition ho
can under the law, but it is the opinion of
experienced army officers that he can find
no law which will enable him to recognize
the general in command as having any j
other authority than that delegated to
him by the Secretary of War, who is and |
must be his superior.
MINOR ENGAGEMENTS WITH
THE ELUSIVE FILIPINOS
MANILA, Aug. 10, 5:45 p. m.â Official \
reports received here from the scene of '
the recent fighting with the Filipinos say j
the day was spent in reconnoissance, dur
ing which the American troops found a
few of the enemy. But there were no en
gagements of importance, A battalion
of the Seventeenth Infantry, under Major
O'Brien, advanced very close to Angeles.
The major reports about 250 insurgents
there. A battalion of the Twelfth In
fantry made a reconnoissance in the di
rection of Porac, but the enemy there scat
tered. The main body of the American
army is at Calulum. The lines have been
lengthened materially since the advance j
was stopped yesterday, and now includes |
the towns of Guagua and Santa Rita
Major General Otis to-day Issued an
order closing the ports in the hands of
the insurgents to Interisland traffic.
Aguinaldo issued a decree July 24, dated
from Tarlac, closing the insurgent ports
to vessels flying the American flag and
inviting vessels under other flags to visit
them. Visitors under foreign flags can
not traffic with these ports without run
ning the blockade.
The gunboats Concord, Yorktown, Callao
and Pampanga bombarded San Fernando
Tuesday. The Filipinos replied with can
non and musketry for an hour and then
fled to the hills, the gunboats firing on
them through machine guns until the
rebels disappeared. The bombardment
was continued for some time afterward
and many houses were riddled and de
stroyed, but the town was not set on fire.
The gunboats did not land men. The
rebel losses are not known.
The United States transport Sheridan
left for home with 607 men of the South i
Dakota Regiment, 996 of the Minnesota '
Regiment and 205 discharged men.
HARD FIGHTING FOR
FIFTY-FIRST IOWA
Colonel Loper Tells the Story of
the Becent Severe
Battle.
PES MOINES, Aug. 10.â The Dcs
Moines News has received the following ;
cablegram from Colonel J. C. Loper, com
manding the Fifty-first Regiment, in ref- j
erence to Wednesday's battle:
"The Fifty-first lowa saw some of the j
hardest fighting it has encountered dur
ing the present campaign. Our forces j
advanced several miles from San Fer
nando, wading through deep mud and
fighting almost constantly, the Filipinos
retiring In considerable confusion, but ,
maintaining a steady fire. The engage- j
ment was general, 6000 of the enemy being !
engaged, while General Mac Arthur had,
in addition to our regiment, the Ninth
and Twelfth regiments and the Thirty
sixth, part cf the Seventeenth and a
cavalry troop. Our advance was assisted
by the artillery, fifteen guns employed.
One battalion of- the Fifty-first accom
panied the artillery in a successful move
ment in the direction of Mexico, the regi
ment advancing with the main body of
troops toward Angeles. The American
loss was severe, several killed and about
twenty-five wounded. Our casualties j
were as follows:
Harry P. Brenholts, private Company j
M, Mount Pleasant, shot in leg; severe.
Lamont Williams, second lieutenant
Company E, Shenandoah, shot in both
thighs; modeiate.
Peter Hardiff, private Company C, Hen

ADMIRAL DEWEY WILL
NOT VISIT ENGLAND
Sends His Regrets, but Says He Must
Be in New York in
October.
LONDON, Aug. 11.â Admiral Dewey,
in response to an inquiry made by the
Daily Mail, sends the following:
"I regret that I cannot visit England.
Must arrive in New York by October
1."
The Rome correspondent of the Daily
Mail says: The warm reception given
Admiral Dewey in Italy is regarded
with mixed feelings by the Govern
ment, which is morbidly anxious not to
offend Spain. As it is, the Spanish Em
bassador, Signor Cipriano del Maso,
protested against the toasts proposed
by General Bogliolo, Admiral Gonzales
and the Prefect of Naples at the re
cent reception of the American admiral,
in which the American victories over
Spain were glorified. In consequence of
i the protest, the Government requested
Bogliolo, Gonzales and the Prefect to
furnish explanations, which the Em
bassador accepted as satisfactory, but
the incident produced a bad impression
and Admiral Dewey abandoned his in
tention to come to Rome.

LA NINFA'ON THE REEF
AT BARBERS POINT
She Is Not Stove In, but Leaking
Badly and Will Probably
Be Lost.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 10.â The
steamer Miowera brings news that the
topmast schooner La Ninfa is on the
reef off Barbers Point, where a hundred
years ago Captain Barber, whose name
was given to the point, was wrecked.
The La Ninfa lies one mile off the beach
and three miles westward of Pearl Har
bor, just out from Ewa Plantation. The
vessel has only eight feet of water un
der the bow and draws ten feet. Her
keel is gone and, although not yet stove
in, she is leaking badly. She has a
cargo of about 3500 bags of paddy con
signed to Hyman Bros., which is in
sured with John Walker. If her cargo
can be taken off she can probably be
saved. It is hardly likely, however,
that the cargo can be saved.
The La Ninfa was bound from Hanalel
to Honolulu. In tacking in off Barbers
Point the vessel got in too close and
found herself on the sandbar. This
happened about 5- o'clock in the after
noon. She ran on to the bar head on
and immediately swung around to port.
There was aboard the La Ninfa five
Japanese and three white men in the
crew and two passengers.
The La Ninfa came to Hilo some
months ago with a load of lumber from
the Sound and then entered the island
coasting trade. She made two trips to
Alaska before coming here. She is now
owned by John H. Wilson and is valued
at $6000.

served for witnesses when the session of
the Mazet executive investigation com
mittee met to-day. They came from all
parts of the city, from Coney Island to
the Bronx.
Mr. Mess said that the only book fur
nished him by Captain McCluskey's de
tective bureau was one showing robberies
with a record of property recovered. The
property appearing therein does not ap
pear on the Chief's book. Mr. Moss read
from the book the value of the property
recovered. It showed that property from
all over the United States was brought
to New York and disposed of in pawn
shops and other places. "It appears from
this," said Mr. Moss, "that thieves who
live here go into the outlying districts to
commit robberies and then bring their >
plunder to this city and get rid of it j
here."
"Yesterday," said Mr. Moss, "we put in
evidence the record of the complaints of
160 citizens robbed in two precincts by
women. Now, 1 offer a transcript from
the record showing 190 other such rob
beries reported to the police in four pre
cincts."
John R. Wood, one of the committee's
detectives, testified concerning the opium
joints In New York City. He also detailed
many interesting facts concerning the
existence of poolrooms in the city. The
manner in which t.he Police Commis
sioners deal with offending policemen was
the feature during the latter half of the
day.
COMMANDED BY MEXICANS.
Veteran Officers Head the Yaqui Up
rising.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Aug. 11.â spe
cial from El Paso, Tex., says: Senor
Aguierre of this city, formerly an officer
in the Mexican army, and who was
charged by the Mexican Government with
being implicated in the Ocho revolution,
received a letter to-day from a friend in
Guaymas, in which he says: "The Yaqui
Indians now in the field are commanded
by old commanders of the Mexican army,
who came to Sonora from Mexico City
two months ago, before the uprising. Th. .
Government is suppressing this fact,
fearing it would encourage uprisings In
other portions of the country. The Yaquis
have provisions for a two years' war.
General Luis Torres will be removed
from command of the Mexican forces and
General Angel Martinez will succeed him.
It Is reported here that the Mayos will
join the revolutionists, and there are 2000 I
Mayo warriors on the Mayo River."

EX-AUDITOR BRODERICK
CALLS PHELAN DOWN
ACCUSES HIM OF RANK mis-
STATEMENT.
Denies That He Ever Discussed the
Auditor's Appropriation With.
the Executive.
In making his suggestions for the re
cently framed tax levy Mayor Phelan
took occasion to say that Auditor Wells
appropriation might be cut down $1000
without in any way inconveniencing that
official In the performance of his duty.
He said he knew this could be done, as
ex-Auditor Broderick had told him so. It
was a strong argument to use against
Auditor Wells, and the Mayor made it
one of his great points. Some one called
Mr. Broderick's attention to the matter a
day or so ago, and now he has come
down on the Mayor, and in a letter to Mr.
Wells gives Mr. Phelan the lie direct. The
letter which Mr. Wells received yester
day was as follows:
Asa R. Wells Esq., Auditor, San Francisco-
Dear Sir: My attention was this day called to
the following extract from the report of the
meeting of the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors, as published in the Examiner,
August 4. The committee were considering the
schedules or estimated appropriation tendered
by the Merchants' Association and also by
Mayor Phelan.
Mayor Phelan, in reply to a question about
the Assessor's appropriation, stated that his
estimate was $20,000 less than the amount al
lowed last year, and an Increase of $11,000 over
the committee's figures. He reduced the Audi
tor's allowance for writing the assessment roll
$1000 on the statement of former Auditor Brod
erick that it could be shaved $1000.
In Justice to my own reputation and experi
ence In the Auditor's duties and in justice to
yourself, I desire to say that Mr. Phelan (If
quoted properly) is entirely wrong In the state
ment relating to the allowance for the Audi
tor's office.
I have never had occasion to express an opin
ion ns to the Auditor's allowance for this year.
The question was never put to me by any one,
nor have I had any occasion to refer to It as
stated by Mr. Phelan: From experience I Judge
that the allowance now settled upon will force
you to make a strong reduction In rate of com
pensation of clerks to enable you to meet the
requirements of law and the duties assigned
to Auditors b> etatutes. Yours very respect
fully, WILLIAM BRODERICK.

ager of the State Board of Trade, have
received letters from Admiral Dewey,
dated "at sea" on June 30 and mailed at
Trieste, Austria. When the Admiral was
in Manila and it was known that he was
to return to the United States a strong
c-.srt -Â»__* -isAo to have him return by
the way of San Francisco. All of the
commercial bodies and dozens of private
citizens used every means In their power
to effect this end, but to no purpose. In
response to the invitations Admiral Dewey
thanks the people of this city and State
for their invitations and says that his
return route had been selected before the
requests were received by him.

DESTRUCTIVE FIRE
RAGING IN DALLAS
Several Lives Are Supposed to
Have Been
Lost.
DALLAS, Texas, Aug. Fire this
morning destroyed the Guild building,
one of the largest in the city, occupied
by the Darragh Furniture and Storing
Company. The fourth and fifth floors
were occupied by families.
Many heroic rescues were made by
firemen. The Clifton Hotel, on the west,
and the Garlington Produce Company's
building, were partly demolished by fall
ing walls and are now burning. Armour
& Co.'s storage plant and the Standard
Electric Light Company's immense plants
are threatened.
At 1:40 a. m. the fire Is still raging. It
is supposed several people who became
panic-stricken lost their lives, but It is
impossible to verify It at this hour.

DELEGATES IN THE
THIRTIETH ARE TIE
SIX CANDIDATES ELECTED TO
ONE SEAT.
Crimmins and Kelly and the Centrals
Got Six Delegates
Each.
Six candidates tie for the same dele
gate's seat in the Thirtieth Assembly
District is the unusual circumstance de
veloped by the official canvass of the
primary ballot by the Election Commis
sioners. The semi-official returns gave
the Kelly-Crimmins faction seven dele
gates in that District and the Central
Rebublican League six. The official re
count gives them six delegates each, with
six candidates tied for the thirteenth
place.
Those of the Central League ticket who
were elected were: Henry B. Russ, Lewis
Freitsch, B. G. Summers, John Ir.ench,
J. J. Morehouse and Charles Mason. The
Kellv-Crimmins delegates were: John E.
Mt-Dougald, C. L. Morgan, A. Brady, N.
B. Engle, I. Erb and A. Sadler. Those
who were tied with 185 votes each were:
E. C. Stirling, Frank Lawrence, Matthew
Harris and M. C. Baker of the Central
League ticket, and R. Cox and John H.
Durst, representing the Kelly and t'rim
mins faction. The question of which of
the six has won will have to be deter
mined by the convention, which may se
lect one of the number or allow all six
to sit with a sixth of a vote each.
The official canvass of the ballots will
probably be completed to-day. The Com
missioners worked over them all day yes
terday, and are now well along in the
Thirty-fifth District. The only changes
so far effected are those In the Thirtieth
District.

WOULD NOT CAUSE PERMANENT
FINANCIAL INJUBY.
â â â
' Establishment of a Gold Standard the
Simplest and Most Effective
Way of Attracting
Capital. *>
Facial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.â In diplomatic
circles copies of the report just' present- j
ed to the houses of Parliament by the j
committee which investigated the cur
rency of India have been received. It is â 
on this report that Lord George Hamil
ton, Secretary of State for India, has
based his announcement within the last |
few days that India will be on a gold
standard. This announcement has attract
ed much 'attention in the United States,
and the conclusions are, moreover, to j
| some extent connected with the negotia
| tions carried on some months ago by .
j Senator Wolcott and others representing
' this country as to International bimet
allism. This committee was made up of
the most influential statesmen and finan- ,
! ciers of JEngand. . .
The report first sets forth the origin
; and present condition of the monetary j
system of India and then says:
"We proceed to consider the question j
i whether, in the light of the six years'
' experience gained since 1893, it is desir- ,
! able to reverse the policy initiated in that j
] year and to reopen the Indian mints to
| the unrestricted coinage of silver. In our |
j opinion any measures for gradual reopen- 1
j ing would be so fully and immediately j
discounted as to defeat the precise ob
jects for which they, are suggested. It
lls obvious, moreover, that the certain
â  prospect of a heavy fall in coinage would I
at once drive capital from India.
"The policy of opening the mints at '
| some future date to silver stands on a dif
! ferent footing when urged by those who
I look forward to the International agree- â 
i ment within a limited period. Such per-
I sons aim directly at a staple exchange :
j between India and the United Kingdom
and advocate delay only in order that an \
international agreement may be reached.
"With regard to this anticipation we
confine ourselves here to stating that the !
' negotiations of 1897 with France and the '
j United States of America having proved ]
I fruitless no fresh prospects, so far as we ,
l are aware, have been or are being made i
! by any of the governments concerned.
"We come next to the suggestion that j
the present system of closed mints han- ;
I dicaps India in her industrial competition
| with countries on a silver standard. This
i aspect of the question was considered by I
Lord Herschell's committee, who ex- I
pressed the opinion that even if we as- j
! sume the argument as to a stimulus or â 
; check to production to be sound, the
effect of each successive fall In exchange ,
must be transitory and could be con- :
tinued when circumstances have brought \
about the inevitable adjustment.
"In this opinion we concur and cvi- I
! dence has been laid before us which
shows that prices and wages have risen
; in China since silver has fallen in price j
and the local currency has appreciated in !
! terms of silver. To reopen the Indian |
: mints to silver without an international j
agreement would unnecessarily result, ac- !
cording to all past experience, in renew- j
] ing the instability of exchanges between !
I India and gold standard countries. .It is :
generally recognized that fluctuations of i
exchange constitute an obstacle to Inter- !
. ' national trade, the true interests of which
are to be sought in a stable monetary
power of exchange."
The report then discusses the principle
; of a gold standard and says: "At the -
present time the practical alternative to '
silver monometallism is a gold standard â j
that is to say, gold as the measure of
value In India either with a gold currency
or a gold reserve.
"Four-fifths of the foreign trade of
India is with gold standard countries, and
for this reason it is desirable that India
should have the same measure of value i
as those countries. The change to a gold j
basis has been presented to us by Pro
fessor Marshall of Cambridge as 'like a
movement toward bringing the railway
gauge on the side branches) of the world's
railways into unison with the main line.'
"A further and not certainly a less im
portant consideration for a country like
India Is that the establishment of a gold
standard is the simplest and most effec
tive means of attracting capital."
In conclusion the report says: "For
these reasons we conclude that steps
I should be taken to avoid all possibility of
: doubt as to the determination now to re
vert to a silver standard, but to proceed
i with measures for the effective estab-
I lishment of a gold standard."

MYSTERY VEILS
LANDIS' DEATH
A Quest of Murder
or Suicide.
. â â¦ â
NO MOTIVE FOR EITHER
SUSPICIOUS BULLET FOUND IN
THE CEILING.

Whitmore and Aber, the Two Men
Arrested, Have Been Beleased

*
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 10.â Can it be
possible that Frank Landis met his
death at his own hands? Rumors are
so thick at Lincoln and Auburn to
night that it is impossible to form any
conclusion that is not shaken the next
minute by some new- and apparently
reasonable theory.
From Auburn to-night comes the
story that members of the Coroner's
jury have declared that they felt some
doubt as to the manner of Landis'
death. Up to the time a bullet from his
revolver was found imbedded in the
ceiling of his store it was thought that
he had committeed suicide, but the dis
covery of this bullet, coupled with the
fact that it matched the one empty
chamber of his revolver, seemed to be
conclusive evidence that the shot had
been fired in a struggle with his mur
derous antagonist. The bullet taken
from his body was also of the same
caliber as that found in the ceiling.
A circumstance which the authori
ties at Auburn mention as singular is
that on the night he met his death
Landis is declared to have taken two
glasses of whisky, although it is not
known that he ever before indulged in
liquor, but no theory of suicide can be
advanced in the face of the fact that
only one chamber of his revolver was
empty and that a bullet of the same
size was found in the ceiling of the
store. No explanation of suicide can
stand unless it can be made to appear
probable that in order to conceal his
intention Landis fired a shot from his
revolver into the ceiling and then re
moving and secreting the shell reloaded
i and killed himself with another dis-
I charge. But then there is the over
turned lamp in the office to be ac
counted for, besides the open door in
! the rear of the store, with the wedge
j which secured it thrown some feet out
i side.
Nobody can advance a single reason
why Landis should have committed
! suicide, but on the other hand there is
Ino apparent reason why anybody
! should have murdered him, for nobody
'in Lincoln was more generally es
teemed. Certainly nothing about the
case indicated robbery as a motive, un
less there is excepted the feature of the
overturned lamp on the office floor, de
noting a possible struggle in an at
tempt to make the young groceryman
open his safe. The Sheriff and three
deputies are still scouring Placer Coun
ty, but up to midnight no arrests had
been reported at the Sheriff's office at
Auburn.
The two men, F. Whit more and J.
Aber, whose arrest was chronicled in
this morning's Call, have been released,
as the suspicion against them did not
appear to be warranted.
Some importance is attached to the
finding of an old suit of underwear
wrapped in paper in front of Landis'
store at the time his body was dis
covered. Nothing about the under
clothes denotes the owner, and the of
ficers have little hope of connecting the
discovery with the person or persons
responsible for young Landis* death.
The case is completely mystifying, and
one theory seems almost as plausible
as another.

Phebe Hearst's University of Cali
fornia Final Plan Competition Is
to Take Place in the Ferry
Building.
The Harbor Commissioners and Captain
A. H. Payson, vice president, and W. B.
Storey Jr.. chief engineer, of the Santa Fe
Terminal Railway Company of California
held a conference yesterday. The ferry
landings between Main and Little Main
street wharves, to be built for the rail
road, were discussed and the Commis
sioners agreed to rush the work to a
completion. Captain Payson informed the
board that the road would be ready for
both freight and passenger business by
January 1. 1900, and Commissioner Harney
announced that everything would be in
readiness for him before that time.
The Commissioners decided to advertise
for bids for tho construction of the land
ings at once, and the secretary was In
structed to write to the State Printer
urging that gentleman to hurry up with
the printing of the specifications. As soon
as these arrive bids will be called for the
work and by January 1. 1900, a competing
road will enter San Francisco.
A communication was received by the
board from J. B. Reinstein. chairman of
thÂ« Phebe Hearst college plans commit
tee, stating that the final international
competition of architects for making the
architectural plans of the University of
California would take place in this city
en Oceober 1. The display will comprise
â 100 drawings and will occupy 600 lineal
feet. The city has been looked over for
a suitable building and the only one that
meets the requirements is the new ferry
depot. Regent Relnstein says:
'The grand nave Is hardly equaled in
the United States and ' - superior even
to the fine wings of the Royal Museum
a: Antwerp, which were furnished lor
the preliminary competition by the munic
ipal authorities of that famous city."
"The Commissioners were asked for suffi
cient space in which to hold the exhibi
tion, and the upstair waiting rooms of the
Tiburon and Sausalito ferries were set
apart for that purpose. The drawings
will be on view for twenty days.
The United States transport Morgan
City sailed for Manila last night with 673
recruits and "casuals" aboard. There
was little or no excitement over the sail
ing of the vessel and very few people
were down to see her off. The recruits
were mar. aboard during the after
noon and the steamer was moved to the
end of the wharf, the Senator taking her
place. As soon as the last of the supplies
were aboard the Morgan City hauled into
the stream and an hour or so later sailed
for Manila.
There Is a rush of freight to the Ha
waiian .lands and every vessel on the
berth has more goods offering than she
can carry. During the last three or four
days the barkentine S. N. Castle has tak
en away merchandise valued at $60,781, the
steamer Moana stuff valued at $9512 and
other vessels as follows: Bark Mohican,
$31,089; bark S. C. Allen, $37,821; steamer
City of Peking, $6039; and the barkentine
Planter, $41,000. Thus goods valued at
over $186,000 have been sent to Hawaii
and sugar valued at more than that sum
has been received here in exchange.
There was a sudden change In the cap
tains of Welch & Co.'s fleet last "Wednes
day night that made some of the old salts

his preparations to go out as master of

Bâ There is no lack of population In the
Philippines so far as I could judge. What
the opportunities are for obtaining land
there for agriculture I could not say. as
that is a matter I know nothing about.
They raise some corn there, but I do not
think it amounts to very much and I
do not think it would be possible to raise
American cereals, such as wheat and bar
ley, on account of the extreme moisture.
I think the climate is too hot for Ameri
cans to work in the fields at any form of
agriculture. Most of the heavy work is
now done by the Chinese. I do not care
to express my opinion as to the probable
effect of the prohibition of contract labor
I:-, the Islands and the extending of our
labor laws to that country. So far as the
climate is concerned a white man can get
along there if he does not try to do any
work, but he cannot live there and retain
his energy unimpaired. I am opposed to
making the Filipinos citizens of the
United States.
PRIVATE W. H. COOK, Company Bâ
There are plenty of people in the Philip-
Ines now. I do not know what the oppor
tunities are for obtaining land for agri
culture. Wheat and barley will not, In
my opinion, flourish in the islands, be
cause there is too much rain and too much
hot weather. Some cattle are raised, but
there does not appear to be any good
grazing country. Americans cannot work
in the fields at any kind of work they are
used to in this country or in raising the
native crops. The hard work at present
Is done principally by the Chinese. I
would not undertake to say what the ef
fect of extending our labor laws to the
islands and forbidding contract labor
there would be. The climate Is enervating
and it is no place for a white man to live
unless he has plenty of money. I do not
think the Filipinos should be made citi
zens of the United States.
PRIVATE L. H. WILSON, Company
Bâ l do not think the Philippines are in
need of any more population. Nearly all
the land there is owned by the church,
and I think a man can get hold of it very
easily if he has a little money, but you
can't raise wheat there nor hardily any
other American grain. They raise a little
corn, but it is very tough and poor. It Is
also impracticable to raise either cattle
or hogs. American field laborers can
neither stand the climate nor compete in
wages with the natives and Chinese, who
do all the hard work. I do not think the
Islands would be profitable to this country
If our labor laws were enforced there and
contract labor prohibited. It Is not a
country for a poor man. People of our
race cannot live in that climate and re
tain their energy unimpaired. The na
tives should not be made citizens of the
United States.
PRIVATE JAMES RUNYAN, Company
Bâ The Philippines are well populated
and there is lots of land there yet, most
of which is owned by the church. I do
not know of any reason why land should
not be easy to gain possession of for the
purpose of agriculture, although I am not
of the opinion that the climate is calcu
lated for American cereals. Corn Is
grown there in small quantities, but It
Is of a very poor quality. Wheat cannot
be grown there, and I do not think other
American grains can. Hogs do not thrive
and few cattle are raised. Americans can

the introduction of our labor laws to the

PRIVATE SIDNEY COOK, Company B
âI think the islands are pretty well peo
pled, although there is undoubtedly room
for a few more. The land should not be
difficult to obtain. It is mostly owned
by the church and is rented to the na
tives and Chinese. Some corn is raised
there, but I do not think wheat or other
American cereals can be grown there with
profit. It is too wet. Americans cannot
work in the fields- there, and they could
not compete wltn the natives even If the
climate was not too much for them. All
the hard work is done by the natives and
the Chinese, and I think they would con
tinue to do It if our labor laws were ex
tended to the islands. It Is no place for
a white man unless he Is a capitalist.
The climate saps his energy and he can
not afford to work for the wages paid to
the natives and coolies. . The Filipinos

Informed as to the facilities for obtaining

to investigate the question. Ido not
think American cereals, such as wheat,
oats, etc., will thrive In the islands; it is
too wet for them. Neither do I think
Americans can labor there In our form
of agriculture, or at all at out-of-door
labor. That work Is nearly all done by
the Chinese. It is hard to say what the
result would be to this country If our
labor laws were extended to the Philip
pines and contract labor In the islands
forbidden. I do not think white men can
live in that country and preserve their

get along easily enough if he had the

he has suffered such Intense mental dis

Whether his death was due. to a deliber

It will bo remembered that Dr. McLay
attended a smallpox patient at tho Mac

diagnosis. Several cases developed
through contact with the body, and Dr.
McLay was taken to the Pesthouse,
where he was quarantined. Being of a

I Oregonians and the Nebraskans in their candidly expressed opinions that the Philippines were
not worth -fighting for. Of the scores of them interviewed by Call reporters yesterday there
was scarcely a soldier who did not declare that the islands are no place for a white man to live; that
he could not work in that enervating climate if he desired, and that the idea of white laborers
competing with the natives and Chinese coolies was out of the question. They were also, almost to
a man, opposed to making the Filipinos citizens of the United States.
So far as the country is concerned, it appears that American cereals will not thrive there, if
the American soldier is any judge of conditions. As zvas the case with the Oregonians and the
Nebraskans, the Pennsylvanians say zvheat and oats will not ripen there ,on account of the exces

prising Americans to obtain any for agriculture.
The soldiers say they are glad to get azvay from the islands, which they would not accept as
a gift.

church, and while I think It could bo ob

much difficulty I do not know: anything
about It. They cannot raise wheat there,
and the corn that is raised Is small and
tough. There are plenty of hogs, but
their flesh is diseased. There are some
good cattle, but I do not think the coun

I should say they were very well popu

that appears to be practically unoccupied,
but I understand it all belongs to the

not thrive In that climate. It is too hot
and too wet. Wheat will not ripen there
and neither will oats. The corn that is
raised Is of little account. The country
Is full of hogs, but they are not fit to

he lost his health and spirits .to such a
degree that it was necessary to call In
the assistance of Dr. A. L. Sobey, his
life-time friend. Upon his return from
the Pesthouse Dr. McLay was never the
same man. For a year he has been the
victim of insomnia, and during the last
few weeks of his life not a moment of
sleep visited him to ease his mind. He
was despondent and cared little for life,
fearing that the reputation which he had
builded as a practicing physician was
shattered by the error which he recently
made. Li _ . Â.,,.
Tuesday mcrning Dr. Sobey visited his
patient and found him in a deep slumber.
Dr. McLay's daughter thought the pa
tient was recovering and had at last found
the sleep which he had been courting for
so many wakeful nights and days. Dr.
Sobey made an examination of his patient
and found that his condition was any
thing but satisfactory- The deen slumber
was not natural: it was the result of
morphine, and the symptoms suggested
poisoning from an overdose of this nar
cotic Antidotes were administered, but
Dr McLav never regained consciousness,
although his physician, with the assist
ance of Dr. McDermott, worked inces
santly to counteract the effect of the
morphine. Their combined efforts proved
futile and at 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing Dr. McLay expired.
The immediate relatives of the deceased
assign the cause of death to Intense men
tal grief. They say that since his return
from the Pesthouse Dr. McLay has wor

day last week Dr. McLay called for Dr.
Sobey and told him that his daughter was
in a precarious condition, and that she
I needed immediate medical assistance to
save her life. Dr. McLay's daughter was
: quite well, but no matter how strong the

iof a mind unbalanced by suffering. Dr.

result of suicide. He is of the opinion that

of so much moisture, combined with ex

good deal of land there held by the
church, but so far as obtaining land for
agriculture Is concerned there are at the
present time no opportunities for doing
so. I suppose some American crops could
be raised in the islands, but It is alter
nately too dry and too wet for such crops
as wheat and oats. The natives raise
some nice cattle. I do not think Ameri

any length of time. The hard work is

There are enough people In the Philip

all the land to be had for agricultural
purposes. There are no facilities for ob
taining land for agriculture at the present
time, but after they get through fighting
over there things may be different.
American cereals may be raised, but I
doubt it. It is certainly too wet for wheat,

Unless enlistments for the Thirty-fifth
Infantry increase materially during the
next few days the regiment will have to
be recruited in the East. Major Brinkor
hoff, recruiting officer for this depart
ment, received a telegram from the adju
tant general directing that enlistments
for the Thirty-fifth be hurried as rapidly
as possible, as it was desired that the
regiment be rilled by the end of this
week. The telegram stated that the regi
ment is short nearly 1100 men, which
means that less than 200 have been en
listed so far.
Another significant statement that ap
peared in the telegram was that Eastern
recruiting offices had been ordered to ac
cept recruits for the Thirty-fifth. It was
originally intended that the Thirty-iifth
Infantry should be a Pacific Coast regi
ment, but the small number of men en
listed here has made that impossible.
Various causes for the reluctance of
prospective soldiers from the Pacific
Coast have been mentioned, the principal
one being that men are all employed here,
or at least such men as would be accept
able to the recruiting officer. Again it is
urged that the population out here is so
small compared to the population East
that enlistments must necessarily be
fewer. At any rate the Thirty-fifth prom
ises to be more of an Eastern than a
Western regiment.
Recruiting stations for the Thirty-fifth
Infantry have been established all over
the State, an officer of the regiment be
ing stationed at each. Lieutenant Becker
Is at Sacramento, Captain Matthews is in

Major Brinkerhoff has received word
that any returned volunteer re-enlisting
for the Philippines may be given a thirty
day furlough immediately upon his en
listment. This has not been generally
known and may remove some of the ob
jections the returning volunteers have had
against going Into service again.
Colonel Greenleaf, medical inspector of
the army, was at the Presidio yesterday
inspecting the general hospital.
"My occupation Is gone when I come
here," was his comment on Colonel Gi
rard's management of the hospital. He
was through all the wards and buildings
and expressed himself as being much
pleased with what he saw.
There is another thing that has pleased
Colonel Greenleaf; that is the condition
of the Presidio camps, but particularly
the volunteer camp. The percentage of
sick at the volunteer camp is but Lfi, or
less than It is In the city. At the recruit
camp it is Just 5 per cent. In estimating
thes/e figures a man is counted sick when
he is relieved from any military dutj on
account of illness. As the men are re
lieved from duty for any slight Illness,
the figures are large rather than small
estimates.
In the hospital there were but two
deaths during the month of July, with
They cannot compete with the latter in
wages, and even If they could they could
not stand the climate. I do not think the
introduction of our labor laws and the
prohibition of contract labor would have
a beneficial result so far as we are con
cerned. Even when not engaged In hard
labor a white man soon gets played out
In that climate. It is good enough for
the natives, but they are not good enough
for us. I am not in favor of making them
citizens of the United States.
CORPORAL D. S. DARRAGH, Com
pany Bâ l think the Philippines are fairly
well populated, but as we were on the
Island of Luzon all the time we were in
the islands we can hardly be expected
to have any definite knowledge of condi
tions on the others. The land appears to
be nearly all In the hands of the church,
and at present there are no opportunities
for obtaining land for agriculture. Aside
from the native crops I could not say
what could be raised there. I saw some
fine looking cattle, but there does not
appear to be any grazing land. I do not
think American cereals will grow there
on account of the extremes of heat and
moisture. The extreme heat would also
be a bar to Americans laboring In the
fields. That class of work is all done by
the Chinese. I do not think our labor
laws could be extended and enforced In
the islands with any degree of success
and profit to us. The climate Is ex
tremely enervating and a white man can
not live there longer than three years.
I do not want to see the Filipinos made
citizens of the United States.
SERGEANT G. L. McCLELLAN, Com
pany Bâ do not care to say much about
the Philippines, as I do not pretend to
know very much about them. They are
pretty well populated, though, and I do
not think there Is any great amount of
unoccupied land that Is not owned by the
church. * The climate is not â¢ suited for
the raising of American cereals and nei
ther is it adapted to American workmen.
The natives and Chineseâ principally the
latterâ do all the hard work, and they
would continue to do it even If our labor
laws were established in the islands. It
is not a suitable climate for people of our
raoe. There are some very intelligent
Filipinos, but I am not In favor of mak
ing them citizens of the United States.

looking native cattle in Luzon. Americans
cannot work out of doors in that climate.
The hard work Is done now by the Chi
nese, I do not think it would make any
difference If our labor laws were extended
to the Islands and contract labor prohib
ited. Americans and Europeans cannot
live in the Philippines and retain their
energy. They soon find themselves cul
tivating a habit of indolence like the
natives. I am decidedly opposed to mak
ing the Filipinos citizens of the United
States. They are a degraded set of people
and not fit to be considered our equals.
PRIVATE G. W.Â« BITTNER, Company
Eâ l do not think there is any lack of
population in the Philippines, judging
from what I saw of the islands. I do not
know anything about the ownership of the
land or the opportunities for obtaining
possession of It for agriculture; neither
am I prepared to say whether wheat or
other American cereals could be success
fully raised there or not. I do not think
Americans could work there either in our
form of agriculture or In raising the na
tive products of the soil. The hard work
is now done by the Chinese. The climate
Is not suited to people of our race and
they soon become enervated. I do not
think the Filipinos should be made citi
zens of the United States at the present
time, but they might be later after they
have become more civilized.
PRIVATE JOSEPH SCULLY. Company j
Gâ would not live In the Philippines if |
I owned every island down there. It s â 
a pretty place and Its natives seem pros
perous and happy, but the climate is too |
hot for an American. When we struck
the cold weather the boys became invig
orated. Then we noticed particularly the
difference in the two climates. Some of
the boys stood the change, but they lost
weight. I don't think a white man could
live in the Philippines and be healthy and
happy. Of course there are many golden |
opportunities there for American capital, I
but American labor - had best stay at
home. The country is thickly populated
and the natives and Chinese coolies do
most of the work. In the heat of the day
they, too, become Indolent and sleepy.
The natives should never be made citi
zens of this country. The chance for the
introduction of our agricultural system I
Is good. The land is fertile and they raise
good crops of rice, hemp and corn.
PRIVATE EDWAR.D MOORES, Com
pany â The Filipinos should never be al
lowed to become citizens of our country
with privileges equal to ours. They are
a low-bred race, extremely , treacherous
and utterly Ignorant. We soldiers who
have endured all sorts of hardships in the
Philippines are prejudiced against tho
country, but 1 believe the islands will i
ultimately become profitable to the United
States. A white man, however, cannot |
labor there and live long. The country
is too hot and there are only two seasons.
The wet season is uncomfortable and un
healthy and the dry season iake3 all the
ginger out of an American.' An Ameri
can could become acclimated after a few
years if he lived that long, but he would
not be able to work. Everything they I
raise in the Philippines Is first class.

lots of good corn. The mining outlook is
encouraging. .

EASTERN CAPITAL IS
COMING TO OUR MINES
SHASTA COUNTY SOON TO EX
PERIENCE A BOOM.
D. P. Posey, Owner of the Tom Boy
Mine, and G. S. Holmes, of Salt
Lake, Come Seeking In
vestments.
D. P. Posey of Denver, owner of the
famous Tom Boy mine, and G. S. Holmes,
owner of the Knuttsford Hotel of Salt
Lake City, are in the city visiting Sidney
Smith. The purpose of their visit is to
examine into the merits of the Bully
Chupe mines of Shasta County. William
Bruce, formerly of South Africa, is now
looking at the property, and if his re
port is favorable these gentlemen will
purchase it and a new mining combina
tion will enter the State with capital to
back It. The Shasta County property Is
a large deposit of low-grade ore upon
which $130,000 has been spent In develop
ment.
Sidney Smith is building a pumping
plant on his Bismarck and Glad
stone property, near Nevada City, and
making contracts to sink 300 feet deeper.
Much money has been spent on this mine,
and as surface indications are very prom
ising it Is thought that the fissure veins
will be found to go down, as such Is the
formation of all that part of the country,
A clean-up of $1100 has just been made
on the Garner mine in Calaveras County.
This Is the property that was originally
opened by Marion de Vries and the
former owners, S. S. Lucas and G. G.
Gates. A large body of rich ore was
found on the lower level and a tunnel is
now being pushed ahead as rapidly as the
work can be accomplished by the aid of
machine drills. The owners propose to
erect large hoisting works and sink 5"0
feet deeper. This property has thus far
produced over $100,000 on its upper levels
alone. Formerly it was necessary to haul
the ore some four miles down the river
in order to work it, but now the ten
stamp mill known as the Tripp mill has
been purchased, together with the water
rights that go with It. Ten more stamps
will be added, making the mine the
cheapest working property in the State
aside from some of the old Spanish mines.

to the people of our race, but at the same
time they can easily endure It. The sol
diers had much to contend with. They
were laboring under many disadvantages
which made their stay there extremely
uncomfortable. The possibility of Intro
ducing our labor laws In the Philippine*
is quite remote. In the first place, it is
out of the question to attempt to raise
their labor standard, It has fallen so low.
They can live so cheaply that they work
for almost nothing. The Chinese and
Filipinos do most of the work. Mining
operations could be carried on profitably.
We found good indications of gold, coal
and lead, but it would take considerable
capital to work the deposits. Most of the
natives are low-bred and Ignorant and
extremely treacherous. The facilities for
securing land seem to be good, but after
an American got hold of a strip large
enough to raise anything on he would
have to hire native laborers, as he could
not do the work himself.
PRIVATE STONE, Company Lâ ln Lu
zon there is the finest farming land I
have ever seen, but I don't think an Am
erican could live there and be contented.
They raise good corn, but I did not see
any wheat. The rainy season Is too wet
and the dry season too dry for wheat.
The introduction of American agricultu
ral machines would greatly benefit the
production of the country and perhaps
make farming more profitable, but while
the labor standard remains as low as it
is there is absolutely no chance there for
a white man without capital. The cli
mate impairs the energy of white people.
A person doesn't want to do anything but
sleep. The nights are pleasant, and the
rich people of Manila are quite an enter
taining class. The lower classes of na
tives are ignorant and superstitious. Why,
they thought when we first went down
there that the identification tags we wore
about our necks protected us from bul
lets. The country around Manila i_
thickly populated. I don't think it possi
ble to introduce our labor system in the
Philippines. No true American should
favor a proposition to make the Filipinos
citizens with, privileges equal to ours.

The Current Industrial Boom.
A New York circular says: "Sufficient con
sideration has not been accorded the fact that
the United States is more under the Influence
of industrial affairs than ever before. For
years it has been the custom of ' merchants
and bankers to formulate their plans upon the
prospects and results of agriculture. Without
in any degree wishing to underrate the im
portance of the latter, it is necessary- to keep
in sight the wonderful march of industry.
We are rapidly passing from an agricultural
into a manufacturing population. In 1880 there
were 7,600.000 persons employed in agriculture
and 8,400,000 in manufacturing. In IS9O the
totals were 6,400.1 and 5,090,000 respectively.
During this ten years the Increase In entire
population, according to the census, was 25
per cent; the increase in agricultural employ
ments being only 10 per cent, while that in
manufacturing was nearly 50 per cent. The
next census will certainly show a very much
larger development of Industry. Figures could
be "added showing that agriculture has little
more than held its own during the past ten
or twenty years, while the mineral and manu
facturing industries have doubled and quad
rupled their output many times over during the
same period. The object of these remarks is to
impress upon the reader the importance of the
industrial 'boom' which the country is now
experiencing, and which has never . been ap
proached, .- far outweighs in importance In
the sum total of prosperity any increased bene
fits that the agricultural situation Is likely to
offer. In the iron ide and its various
branches extraordinary conditions prevail.
Furnaces and mills are running to their ut
most capacity; hi-.'!-, prices fail to check de
mand; large" advances have been made in
wages: the demand is legitimate, not specula
tive, and is expected to continue for another
year at least. Export orders are frequently
refused to satisfy home demands. The textile
trades are si aril the improvement; cotton mill
building in the South is progressing at an ex
traordinary rate; and throughout the whole
country the wheels of industry .ire humming
at a rate never before experienced."
Wheat, Corn and Cotton,
Mall advices from New York say: "It Is alto
gether too early yet to form any positive opin
ions as to the final yield of the principal crops;
but of wheat, corn and cotton there is every
prospect of a sufficiency to meet our own and
foreign requirements. Wheat has been the
chief subject of anxiety, because of early in
juries both at home and abroad. The most
conservative estimates indicate a yield this year
of not less than 560.C00.t-00 bushels, possibly
more, compared with 675.000.000 last year. In
view, however, of the surplus left over from
previous crop, It is expected that we shall have
available for export at least 200,000,000 bushels,
again. 222.0C0.000 bushels last year, which was
next to the largest year ol" wheat exports in
our history. It is questionable, therefore, if
a larger wheat crop would be an advantage;
for there is no prospect of serious scarcity In
the world's supply, and a second bumper crop
might be disastrous to farmers If low prices
followed. As to corn, much depends upon the
next few weeks, the present outlook being for
a crop of over 2,000,000,000 bushels, compared
with 1,924 OilO. ooo bushels In 1898. Cotton, ac 7
cording to an average estimate, promises a
crop of 11,250,000 bales, or about the same as
last year. Thus, while, the crop situation af
fords no basis for extravagant expectations, It
certainly promises the farmers over a large
section of the country results above the aver
age, particularly when the better prices now
realize. are taken Into consideration. We are
at least sure of a good foreign demand for our
wheat for the second year in succession. This
Is all that can be said of the agricultural situ
ation."
Stocks and Gold.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The most substantial feature in the stock
market is the railroad department. These se
curities have been tried: their earning capacity
is beyond the experimental stage; and present
prosperity, especially of those running through
the grain and manufacturing districts, prom
ises continual large earnings for some time to
come. There is one element of caution In
the market, and that is money. Firm rates
seem probable, a result-of good times, not fear
or adversity. Leaders are looking forward to
a 6 per cent market. The probabilities of a
squeeze are not seriously discussed; but they
are sufficiently possible to act as a wholesome
restraint upon illation. A drop In exchange
exerted a favorable effect here; and the pros
pect of continue! large exports of grain, pro
duce and manufactures Induces the belief that
gold imports will not be long delayed, notwith
standing European opposition. Last year Eu
rope sent us securities Instead of gold; but the
foreign supply of the former has been so re
duced that we are likely to draw the precious
metal when wanted. Gold is now arriving from
the Klondike and Australia, to say nothing of
increasing home production. Except for the
money outlook the situation favors higher
prices. Powerful interests are supporting the
market, expecting renewed outside support in
due season. Later on the course of affairs will
be much more interesting."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â To-day's stock mar
ket was a great deal more active than for
gone time past and showed undeniable evi
dence of strength. But the strength was for,
the most part in spots and the speculation
did not get far outside professional limits.
The favorites were the industrials and only
a few of the railroads made any conspicuous
gains. The most prominent movement, of the
day was in the leather stocks, the common
rising 1% and the preferred 1% on very heavy
dealings in the first named. The iron - and
steel stocks as a group all showed strength
in somewhat . varying degree, but gains in
most of them reached a point and in some of
them approached two points. . Tennessee Coal
| and Iron was the leader of the group and of
I the market with a rise of nearly three points
!on very heavy demand. The strength In this
I group Is accounted for by the extraordinary
condition in the iron trade, when production
of the lower grades, although largely increased,
seems quite able to keep pace with consump
tion in the higher grades of the industry.
Anaconda mining shows a handsome gain and
there was a very large demand for National
Lead. American Smelting, Tin Plate, Colorado
Fuel and various other stocks more or less
affected by conditions In the iron trade were
firm In sympathy. Sugar, People's Gas, De
troit Gas and Linseed Oil preferred had their
periods of strength. In the railroad list specu
| lation was Inclined to hold aloof pending the
| publication of the Government crop report. The
i St. Paul statement for the first week of Au
j gust prompted some buying of the grangers.
Gains of a point or over were shown by the
'â¢ Kansas, Pittsburg and Gulf, Oregon Naviga
| tion. Hocking Valley preferred. Wheeling and
Lake Erie preferred, Pittsburg, C, C. and
St. Louis, lowa Central preferred and Pacific
Coast preferred.
Developments In the money market continue
to receive much attention, but were not im
portant to-day. Anxiety as to the outlook was,
however, appreciably less. Outside money con
: tinued to be offered in the local market, call
, money continuing rather easy and rates for
j prime mercantile paper was shaded slightly.
1 Time money, however, continued firm and
lenders were not anxious to do business at
present rates. The failure of the Bank of
England to advance Its rate above 3% per cent
| was deemed to have a good sentimental effect
; on the London market, but private discounts
: there were unchanged. London bought stocks
i here to a moderate extent. -*'
Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf firsts were
I active and strong and have gained 2% per cent

Chicago Grain Market. . .
Â« : . Â»
CHICAGO, Aug. 10.â opening In wheat
was tame, without any material change in
price, September starting at about 69% c. Do
mestic receipts were small, and higher quota
tions came from Liverpool, . but the Govern
ment crop report was due this afternoon, and
pending its issuance traders .were unwilling to
get into the market on either side. The result
was that the .entire- session was marked by a
dullness that is seldom equaled. The intense
heat also kept traders out of the pit except
when actually necessary. September touched
69% c shortly after the opening. The market
followed lazily between that figure and 69c
until shortly after noon, when it gradually
sagged more from the dullness than from any
thing bearish In the news, and the close was
weak at about the lowest point of the day.
The Government report was expected to show
a decline In the condition of spring wheat or
from 5 to 8 points, and this fact, perhaps, pre
vented the market from developing more weak
ness than it did. Crop reports in the North
west were conflicting, but the weather in that
section was favorable. Some hall was reported
in North Dakota and some South Dakota
threshing returns were disappointing, Septem
ber near the close declined to 6S%c, about put
price. Buying against those privileges steadied
the market, but the close was at the bottom-
Corn was fairly steady early, but late In the
session developed marked weakness, L-ignt re- ;
ceipts and a continued good shipping demand
sustained prices. Belief in a bearish Govern- ,
ment report and favorable crop reports, with
the late weakness of wheat, broke corn after
noon, scalpers selling quite freely. The close
was weak and %c to %c lower. j
Oats were dull and weak. September lost tte
Provisions, though rather firm during the
morning, went to pieces in the afternoon, and
closed at declines all around. There was an ,
Improved cash demand, and this helped the ;
market early, but sympathy with the grain
markets started a general selling late in the
day and the decline was not recovered *. At the
close September pork and ribs were 5c lower
and lard 2%c to 5c lower. , Â â"

WHEATâ The markets are apathetio every- j
where. Chicago was â  firm but inactive yester
day, and news from there was meager. The
Michigan State report placed the yield of the
State at an average of only eight bushels per
acre, the smallest fcr years. The Northwestern
crop reports were disappointing, showing a de
creased yield, and It was expected that the
Government report would show the condition
of spring-wheat at 5 points lower than in July.
The Northwestern demand for cash wheat was
strong, with diminishing receipts.
In the local market there was a further frac
tional decline, both In futures and spot wheat.

Much-Married Man Shows Great
Anxiety Regarding the Penalty
for Having Too Many
Wives.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 10.
Young Mrs. Tyrer was weeping at an
early hour this morning in a cabin at
Tesla. William Wolf, the man with whom
she eloped two weeks ago. was weeping
three hours later in Judge Quinn's court.
This is" the beginning of the end of an
Emeryville romance.
William Wolf is sorry now that he de
serted his second wife, that he deserted
his first wife and did not get a divorce,
and that he openly eloped to the Tesla
mines with the divorced wife of another
man. Nothing but the grossest Ignorance
of the nature of women could have led
Wolf to believe that he could hold up to
scorn three of them with impunity. Con
stable Williamson went to Tesla â¢ last
night with the warrant sworn out by
Wolf's second wife charging him with
bigamy. lie nad no difficulty in finding
"Mr. and Mrs. Charles Leiter." When he
told Wolf of the purpose of his visit,
Wolf calmly replied that he was expect
ing the Constable, as he had read about
himself in The Call. As soon as Mrs.
Tyrer realized that her sweetheart was
to go to jail she swooned, apparently. The
harsh * 'onstable proposed dashing a glass
of water on her face, but the sound of
his voice revived the little runaway.
Wolf makes no secret of his many mar
riages, and when in court he asked Judge
Quinn what were the maximum and mini
mum sentences and if his Honor would
let him off as lightly as possible. He Im
plied that he was ready to plead guilty,
but the court informed him that he had
no need to plead at a preliminary exam
ination, that formality being reserved for
the Superior Court. Wolf said he had no
attorney and no means of hiring one, and
seemed far more anxious to know what
his fate would be and to work it out than
to evade the consequences of his actions.
It was not Wolf's first appearance be
fore Judge inn. A few months ago,
when the Judge was Recorder of Emery
ville. Mrs. Wolf discovered evidence of
her husband's perfidy and placed it be
fore him on the street. He was so
angered that he was about to strike her
on the face when he was arrested by a
deputy. He was convicted and judgment
Was suspended to see if he would behave
himself. While on parole for this mis
demeanor he went oft' and added a felony
to it. He is now subject to be sentenced
for his conviction at Emeryville last
winter.
Mrs. Wolf X... 2 has no need to apply
for a divorce The same evidence of her
husband's first marriage in Delaware,
which is still in force anu which will con
vict him of bigamy, will also furnish the
1-asis for an annulment of her alleged
marriage to Wolf in Sacramento. When
in the County Jail Wolf expressed a de
sire- that his second wife call upon him,
but she stated this evening that she has
no intention of meeting him again, ex
cept in court to testify against him.
REVOKED A BEQUEST
FOR A SHELTER HOME
OAKLAND, Aug. 10.â A bitter legal
contest will be instituted, in all proba
bility, over tiie valuable estate of Anne
McMenamin, who led in this city on
July 15 last at the age of 75 years.
The contents of the will tiled for pro
bate this afternoon by Attorneys Fitz
gerald & Abbott on behalf of William
Joseph Keogb and John J. McLaughlin,
who are named in the instrument as ex
ecutors, created a mild sensation.
Mrs. McMenamin was reputed to be
worth between $10,000 and $50,000, and it
was. supposed that she had bequeathed
half of her wealth for the establishment
of a sheltering home in this city. And in
the original will, dated October 30, 1894,
such a bequest is made in the following
iiauÂ«.:
I bequeath unto the Rev. Michael King, rec
tor of the Church of the Immaculate Concep-.
tlon of Oakland, or his successor In charge of
Â«aid parish, the sum of $20,000 for the purpose
of establishing and maintaining in this city a
hheltering home for children said home to be
In charge of the Bisters of the Holy Family.
This is followed by bequests of $5 each
to George Tracy, a brother; Catherine
Brolly, a sister: Rose McLaughlin, a
in-law, all residing In Ireland;
also to the latter $150 yearly; to Ellen
McCaughy; Catherine Boyle, a niece, and
Mrs. Bridget Keogh of San Francisco
SIOO each yearly; to Anne MeCaughy and
Ellen McKeever J." 1 " cash; and to John
McCaughy of Ireland $300 cash.
The residue of the estate is bequeathed
to John J. McLaughlin, whs i's employed
in M. J. Keller's shirt manufactory here.
However, attached to the will Is a
codicil, dated December i, 1896, and wit
nessed by Attorneys Fitzgerald and Ab
bott, by "the terms of which the bequest
to Rev. Mr. King is revoked.
It now develops that Mrs. McMenamin,
prior to her death, deeded most of her
property, including a valuable corner at
Thirteenth and Franklin streets, to At
torney R. M. Fitzgerald in trust for John
J. McLaughlin, a nephew, and one of the
executors.
In the petition filed to-day by Mc-
Laughlin and Keogh, wherein they apply
for letters on the estate, the value of the
estate Is given as unknown, though It is
stated to consist of $750 in bank and
notes, bank stock and furniture valued
about $2250.
This will In Itself create consternation
among the nephews and other relatives,
some of whom were cut off with $.". in the
will, and it is understood they have al
ready retained attorneys to guard their
Interests In the estate. There is little
doubt that McLaughlin's coup by which
he secured most of the estate will be bit
terly contested.

STATE TYPOGRAPHICAL
UNION IN SESSION
OAKLAND. Aug. ID.â The ninth annual
session of the California State Typo
: graphical Union opened at Y. M. I. Hall
to-day.
The report of President Read was read.
In which he said that although the State
union had not extended its field of oper
ations during the past year it has held
Its own and was financially In good condi
tion. The report urged the convention
to consider the question of the better uni
fication of all the local unions in the
State.
"The State union is not properly un
derstood by some of our members."
said the president. "They fail to see the
: immense benefits that would accrue from
a strongly organized and powerful com
bination of all th.- printers of this State.
Without a united and representative
union it would be suicidal to make any
' demand whatever or anywhere. That was
; unfortunately demonstrated last year In
a neighboring city, if the allied printing
trades will join the State union in a body,
If the few 'knockers' will hold their
peac" l confidently diet that the 'ad
fornia State Typographical Union will be
come what its projectors Intended a use
ful and beneficial and Indispensable trade
union, for the mutual benefit of all.
The day's proceedings were taken up
with the reading of reports. Delegates
were present from Fresno, Sacramento,
San Francisco, Oakland, Stockton, Santa
Rosa and Eureka.
This evening there was a ball and en
tertainment in honor of the visiting dole
gates. To-morrow the annual election of
officers will be held.

OAKLAND
IMPROVEMENT CLUBS
HAVE GONE ON RECORD
OAKLAND. Aug. 10.â At a meeting of
the North Oakland Improvement Club last
night a guarded reply to Councilman
Girard's communication on the municipal
ownership of water was adopted. The
reply is to the effect that while the club
some time ago unanimously passed reso
lutions favoring municipal ownership, it
would not place itself on record as In
dorsing the purchasing of the Roberts
wells at San Leandro, or any other, until
such source shall have been proved be
yond a reasonable doubt to be amply suf
ficient to supply any required demands.
The Boulevard and Peralta Heights Im
provement Association has gone on record
j in favor of the opening of Sixteenth
street. The club is opposed to any change
jin the plans for the dredging of Lake
M> rritt.
THEY ARGUED ALL DAY.
Contending Attorneys in Larsen
Explosion Damage Suit Dis
cuss Proximate Cause.
OAKLAND. Aug. 10.â The suit of Ras
! mus Larsen against the "Western Fuse and
| Explosives Company for $1500 damages
on account of the wrecking of his nome
by the explosion of the Melrose Fuse
Works will probably be decided either by
the jury or Judge Ogden to-morrow.
The greater part of to-day was con
sumed by motions and arguments by the
contending attorneys. But little testi
mony was taken by the defense, which
closed Its side of the case early in the
day. It was then that Attorneys Nus
baumer and Chapman moved the court to
instruct the jury to find for the plaintiff
on the pit adings, inasmuch as the answer
of defendant admitted every material al
legation.
This motion being disposed of by a re
fusal on the part of Judge Ogden, Attor
neys Wright and Lukens moved that the
i Jury be Instructed to find for the de
'â  fendant on the ground that no negligence,
carelessness or nuisance had been proved.
The arguments which followed were
closely confined to a thorough discussion,
accompanied by any number of citations
of cases, of the doctrine of the proxi
mate cause and nuisances per se. The
attorneys for the : defendant vigorously
contended that Ah Ing. the Chinese mur
derer whose arrest was being sought by
the officers, was solely responsible for the
explosion, and that the corporation did
all In its power to avoid the explosion.
The arguments continued until 5 o'clock,
when the matter went over till to-morrow
morning.

Secretary Sharpe Outlines the Plan
That It Is Thought Will Be
Successful Next
Winter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Aug. 10.
There will be no Oakland Exposition
this year. This step has not been formal
ly announced by the directors, but the
fact is known that the annual show will
not tak â¢ place. '.
The decision of the directors is largely
due to the failure of the exposition last
year, when it was placed under the man
agement of Count Charles de Garmo
Gray. Much prejudice was engendered
against the show and financially as well
as spectacularly it was a dire failure.
The exposition usually opens in the
middle of August at the Tabernacle. As
nothing has been done this year toward
the opening Secretary Craigie Sharp was
asked to-day what the corporation in
tended to do. "There will not be any
show this August," said he. "The people
-â¦â -_. -â¦â$. -â¦âÂ£>-â¦-- <$-*-"**- â¦â Sâ â¦-*-.-â â¦âJ*-*--Â©
have not yet forgotten the disappointment
of last year, and it is thought that it
would be better to wait a while before at- ;
tempting another exhibition. Count de
Garmo Gray did not manage the. affair
according to Oakland's ideas and in ad
dition to eating up all the Income he man
aged to expend the large surplus that re
mained from the previous year when I
was superintendent of the exposition.
"By next year we shall probably be
able to erect a suitable building and there
must bo many new ideas Injected into the
show. People will not come year after
year to see the same thing. It is not pos
sible to hold an exposition to advantage
In the old Tabernacle. Next year will be
a presidential year and there will he a
big demand for a suitable auditorium or
wigwam In which to hold monster politi
cal meetings. This fact, in connection with
the assured income from a well conduct
ed and representative exposition, would
justify the erection of a suitable building.
The cbtporatlon has a fund In bank which
might form the nucleus of a permanent
building, but of course this is not decided.
It should be comparatively easy to inter
est public sentiment next year, whereas
it would be impossible to do so this year.
Besides. It is too late now to undertake
the task and open the exposition at the
time we have found to be the best, name
ly. August."
The Oakland Exposition was Inau
gurated about five years ago and gave
three very successful shows. Last year
It entrusted the management of the af
fair to a professional show organizer and
the directors greatly regretted the de
parture from their ordinary course. From
every point of view the affair was unsuc
cessful and had there not been a good
surplus left from the previous years the
society would now be heavily in debt.

STATE PRINTERS INDORSE

Whoever Is Chosen Must Name the
Deputies Selected by Gage and
â Complications Over
the Governor's Staff.
Politicians are all concerned In a quiet
interview which took place not' long
ago in the Palace Hotel between Gov
ernor Gage and A. J. Read of Oak
land, who is a candidate for Labor Com
missioner.
The appointment of Labor Commis
sioner should have been made by the
Governor three months ago when Com
missioner Fitzgerald's term expired. Ow
ing to the strong fight being made by
several candidates, the Governor has <
been unable to decide which candidate
would be the best suited to his Interests.
Two months ago it was known that the
Governor had decided to appoint Wallace j
Pond of Berkeley, formerly of Yolo, to
the position. But the friends of other j
candidates were so determined that Mr.
Pond should not set the plum that the â¢
Governor vacillated, and now unless he
shall decide upon a dark horse the nght
is squarely between Wallace Pond and ;
A. J. Beau. __
This makes the call of Mr. Read on the i
: Governor a matter of great interest, and
i ail are wondering what transpired at the
! little meeting at the Palace.
Naturally th.- friends of Mr. Read con- |
I Btrue the meeting as favorable, trguing ;
i that the Governor would not send for ;
| Mr. Read unless he intended to tal__ busi-
I ness with him.
During the past few weeks the support- I
! ers of A. J. Read have made many __-
i saults upon the Governor. It is known
j that among the Oakland man's warm
friends are Dr. Pardee, Frank A. Leach, \
Colonel J. P. Irish, Congressman Metcalf, (
W. G. Hens-haw and J. J. Valentine.
At yesterday's session of the annual con- j
vention of the State. Typographical Union
the following message proposed by Dele- ;
gate Coolldge of Santa Rosa was unani
mously ordered sent to the Governor:
"Hon. H. T. Gage, Sacramento: Call- i
fornia State Typographical Union, -low in I
session, respectfully requests that you
will appoint A. J. Read, our honored presi
dent, to thÂ© position of Labor Commis- j
sioner."
The Labor Commissioner's office under |
the new law has qulfet an extensive pat- i
ronage. About eight deputies, including ]
the chief deputy, have to be appointed, ;
some in San Francisco, one in Sacra- j
mento, one in Los Angeles and one in San j
Jose. It is believed to be this patronage
which Is causing the tie-up in the nam- |
ing of a Commissioner. Mr. Read de
clines to say anything regarding his ;
Interview with Governor Gage and seems i
surprised that the fact has become public.
The Governor's long hesitation over .
j this appointment may occasion surprise ]
J in Oakland, but the politicians elsewhere :
- who get inside tips know that the ques- â 
i tion of patronage must be settled before
i a commission is Issued to Mr. Fitzgerald's
successor. Whoever gets the office of
Labor Commissioner must signify in ad
vance that he will appoint deputies and !
attaches from a list of names to be fur- |
nished him. No doubt this list has been |
prepared to meet the views of Gage and j
! Burns on the distribution of patronage. j
i Bead may kick against the programme
and Pond of Yolo may show signs of re- |
j volt, but the programme for subordinates !
'. will not be changed to please the head of
] the bureau. The Bureau of Labor Sta
i tistics is to be used as a political agency |
!to boost Dan Burns. If neither Read nor i
Pond will accept the terms prescribed, j
I some other aspirant may be easily found
who will take the office for the salary and !
accept the patronage list without ques
tion. It is possible that applicants in j
j their zeal have promised the trades !
! unions some recognition in the selection j
lof deputies. It will not be possible for I
I the successful aspirant to fulfill such '
j promises. The unions should he advised j
1 that the patronage has been held out for
! the Mexican, so that time may not be
1 wasted In Indorsing favorites.
In the National Guard there is much i
whispering about appointments to the j
j staff of Governor Gage. The colonels.
' lieutenant colonels and majors who sur- !
j rounded Governor Budd and lent such
brilliancy to the Gage inaugural cere- ,
! monies are still on duty. It is said that
' delay in the selection of their successors
is due to an apprehension on the part of '
those who have been invited to serve that
'military duty on Governor Gage's staff
would "imperil their chances of future
' success In politics. An officer on the staff
lof the Governor receives no pay. The .
service affords him no opportunity to
distinguish himself in battle and ' thus
gain promotion and increased emolument.
The only rewards open on the Governor's
staff are social distinction and political
preferment, and as Gage Is tied up to
I Burns he cannot confer either. Gage,
| however, can always console himself for ;
! the absence of military splendor In a
I group by contemplating the isolated
beauty of Adjutant General Seamans.
EXPECTATION
REWARDED AT
THE ORPHEUM
OF all sacrifices that of one's time
is the most painfulâ the
over-employed population, with
but one night in the week for dis
traction, turns Orpheumward with
a light heart, sure of something
it can appreciate. This week's page has
but one blot, and that is Alexandra Dag- j
mar. She comes on ponderously in an
awful gown of no particular time or clime
and an unexplainable. headgear and sings
with grand opera gestures a simple ballad
we have loved this many a day for its
twinging melody, losing by over-exertion
the best notes of a rather good voice be
fore she Is half through. Jus. what "na
tional character" she represents i.-. ihe
act we should like to know. Her cloth
ing disappears by degrees until she
reaches tights, for which there Is no ap
parent demand and no physical excuse,
thus draining the last pint from our cask
of endurance. â¢'?'"'
Now let us talk of something pleasant.
"A Doctor's Patient" is billed, without
claim to dramatic place, a creation of
Harry Linton and Leila Mclntyre, and
is quite the brightest thing in clean witty
dialogue we have heard in a quarter; al
most as bright as Miss Leila's eyes, that
look out amusedly upon a world that is
all a farce and made only for songs and
dances. There is not a dull moment In
the act. A "second hearing of Idalene-
Cotton and "Nick" Long witnout matinee
cuts, brings Maria and Luigl Risotto to the
front as a possible best of the imitations
and undeniably "the real thing." Hav
ing had Mrs. Flske's murder scene thor
oughly explained by one who knows, I am
prepared to say that "Tess" is another
clever piece of work. Idalene Cotton is
an artist, but it is poor judgment to give
imitations of what we have never seen.
When Dixey came out here years ago
and gave us imitations' of Henry Irving
we thought him rather amusing. We did
not know why. and when in the course
of events Sir Henry followed him we
thought how like Henry Dixey he was.
Miss Cotton may get some of her de
served applause In the hereafter. Joseph
Adelman brings some very sweet music
out of wood and glass and lives up to
his good natured face by granting us as
many encores as stage management can
allow. .->-â --. >-:â¢â¢ â¢
The Deonzo brothers care not a rush
for style, and with simple sugar barrels

characteristic note is not grace, but their
dominant qualities are strength and ab

novel. Strap Hill has a wonderful tongue.

Midweek Notes.
"Brother Officers" has been well re
ceived at the Columbia by good houses.
Next week Mr. Miller revives the great
est successes of the season, giving us
"The Adventures of Lady Ursula" on
Monday and Tuesday, "Heartsease" on
Wednesday and Thursday and "The
Liars" on Friday and Saturday and the
Saturday matinee. A special Tuesday
matinee at 1:30 offers a double billâ"Fred
erick Lemaitre" and "Heartsease."
The Tivoli. with a fine cast' and aug
mented orchestra, has sung "Faust" and
"II Tro\ atore" to crowded houses. Next
week "Fidelio" and "Trovatore" will be
the attractions. "Fidelio." though a very
old opera, has not been sung on the coast
before.
The Alcazar with the "Lady of Lyons"
has done an excellent week's business.
The lay will be followed by "Under Two
Flags," with Florence Roberts as Cig
arette and White Whittlesey as Bertie
Cecil, the king of bohemians.
The California offers "London Assur
ance" from Monday to Thursday, inclu
sive, and "As You Like It" the balance
of the week. A special Wednesday mati
nee of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" is adver
tised and those who remember Miss Bates
in "The Doll's House" look forward to
this presentation with pleasure.
"Falka" has crowded the Grand Opera
house and furnished much amusement to
Its patrons. It Is a highly meritorious
performance. Next week "Dorothy," a
comic opera by Alfred Cellier, is to be the
attraction.
Set Fire to the Bedclothes.
An alarm was turned In from box S3
; shortly before midnight last night for a
! fire in a three-story frame building at 133
' Oak street, owned and occupied by
.Thomas Quinn. A member of the house
: hold was reading in bed by aid of a can
: die. which was accidentally overturned,
setting fire to the bedclothes. The dam
, ages were nominal.
Rabbi Voorsang-er's Anniversary.
To-morrow morning Rev. Dr. Voorsan
ger will preach a sermon on the occasion
of the fourteenth anniversary of his rab
binate In the Temple Emanu-El. His
subject will be "Looking Backward and
Forward." The service will be at 10
o'clock. The congregation and the com
munity are cordially invited to attend.

WAGON LOADS OF MONEY.
Five Millions in Silver Coin . Come |
From the Carson Mint.
For several days the officials and em
ployes at the Sub-treasury of this city
have been busy storing away bags of .
silver coin received from the old mint at
("arson. The shipment, which is being j
made through "Wells, Fargo & Co., I
amounts to $5,000,000. The money is in I
5000 bags, containing $1000 each, and the !
transportation of these occupies the at- j
tention of several teamsters. Assistant
Treasurer Jacobs states that he is having
no little trouble in placing the silver i
where It will not be in the way, the vault
room being Inadequate for so large a
consignment. Yesterday three truckloads
were dumped in front of the counter in
the main office, which hampered the
transaction of business not a little.
The coin being sent here was minted In
1890, and since then it has been stored In
the vaults at Carson. The Washington
officials evidently concluded that it would
be better to have the money stored in the
Sub-treasury in this city, although there
Is plenty of money on hand here. Even
after this shipment is complete there will
be lots of silver money in the Carson mint,
which has not been In operation since IMX).
A Neglected Thoroughfare.
At a meeting of the Five-Mile House
Improvement Club last night, Dr. E. N.
Torello expressed himself forcibly regard
ing the .condition of the old Mission road.
This thoroughfare Is so badly neglected
as to render it unfit for traffic, and it Is
avoided by all who can get into San
Mateo County by any other means. Dr.
Torello condemned the action of the
Supervisors in reducing the appropriation
from (10,000 to $3000 for the repair of out
side county roads.
"It is true," he remarked, "that Mission
road is no longer a county road, but
rather a continuation of Mission street.
Be it a street or a road. It is within the
Jurisdiction of the municipality, and It is
the duty of the Supervisors to keep It in
decent repair."
Another breach of trust was alleged
against the City Fathers In not having
provided electric lights for the Mission
district. Circular avenue, between Mis
sion street and San Bruno avenue, has
been permitted to remain in a condition
of darkness for a number of years. The
last Board of Supervisors appropriated a
sufficient sum of money to have electric
lights placed on that - thoroughfare be
tween the two given points, but this
board has failed to provide the improve
ment. -:!â¢-.
A committee representing the . wants
and wishes of the Mission residents will
soon. take the board to task. V

HUNTINGTON EXCITES
LOCAL INSURANCE MEN
Policies for Over a Million on the California-
Street Mansion.
How the Agents of the Railroad Magnate Made
Two Remarkable Appraisements of the Same
Propertyâ The Assessor Outwitted.
CONSIDERABLE excitement has
been created in local insurance
circles over one of the largest
series of policies ever issued on
the Pacific Coast. Within the last
â few days representatives of Collis P.
Huntington have insured the personal
property of the railroad magnate in the
splendid mansion at California and
Taylor streets for over one million dol
lars. Even this enormous valuation
does not represent the true value of the
property that has been insured. Hunt
ington is the possessor of some of the
finest paintings in the world, and he
has seen fit to establish In his Cali
fornia-street home one of the great gal
leries of the United States.
It is not generally known that the
aged railway king is a lover of art if
not of education, and that in his San
Francisco borne he has surrounded i
himself with some of the finest artistic }
gems in existence. These paintings j
have been insured for $700,000, but they
are easily worth much more than that
sum. Huntington has also in his local
palace bric-a-brac of great value. Tears
have been spent in the accumulation
of these household treasures and Hunt
ington has at last recognized the wis
dom of having them insured.
This fact, interesting in itself, pos
sesses a double importance. "When the
insurance agents visited the California
street mansion they were induced to
write policies of $700,000 on the paint
ings alone. The bric-a-brac was also
heavily appraised. When the local rep
resentative of Huntington, E. Black
Ryan, was called upon to place a value i
upon the same material for the Asses
sor he said the paintings and bric-a
brac were worth $8525.
In obedience to the rule which the
Assessor has established Ryan, as the I
representative of Huntington, sub
mitted a list of the assessable property
in the house at Taylor and California
streets. All of the property, real and
personal, was in the name of Mrs. Ara
bella D. Huntington. In the list Ryan
was careful to include an item of $20
for coal, but he was equally careful to
appraise at JJBS2J paintings which are
now insured for $700,000. Mrs. Hunting
SCONCHIN COMES
BACK TO SPEND
NUMBERED DAYS
Dying and Destitute
He Arrives Home.
Sconchln Maloney, whose meteoric
career in .this city is still fresh in the |
minds of lis acquaintances, arrived from
New York, on Thursday night's over
land, broken in health and spirit. The
famous wit was at once removed to his
mother's home in Oakland for a short rest
prior to his departure for Napa, where he
will spend the rest of his numbered days
at the home of his brother. There is little
hope for Sconchin's recovery- He has suf
fered fer many months with a wasting
sickness. Induced, so the physicians say,
by high living and the wild revelries of
prosperous days.
Of all the many characters who have in
the past played star engagements on the
.local primrose paths, Sconchln Maloney
was the most widely known. His name
was a watchword on the tenderloin and
in his palmy days his genial company was
eought by all classes. Sconchln rubbed
shoulders with the nabobs and pleased
the palms of the poor. When he had
money he carried It in his overcoat pocket
and it belonged to everybody. His ready
wit and airy nature made him popular
and his generosity won him the empty
lame of a "good fellow."
When Sconchln first came to California
he was employed In the railroad shops on
Folsom street. His capabilities were real
ized by the inside forces of the railroad
company, and Sconchin was placed in a
responsible position in the Southern Pa
cific's law department, whose destiny was
then presided over by Creed Haymond.
As a railroad politician Sconchin pros
pered beyond the idle dreams of his youth
a_nd -he became a central figure In local
affairs. He made money rapidly and
â¢spent it in the same fashion.
"Aisy come, aisy go." was Sconchln"s
philosophy, and his trail was marked
with empty wine bottles and popped
corks. During his career as a railroad
manipulator Sconchln took a trip to
Japan. Much concern was caused over
his visit, but nobody ever found out why
he took the trip. As a Shakespearean
quoter Sconchin had no peer in the city.
He knew nearly every* passage in the
great bard's works by heart, and his fre
quent exhibitions of his memory brought
him more fame.
Sconchin figured In several Police Court
escapades, and he always defended him
self. When the case was called in the
morning Sconchin always walked Into the
court room with a stack of law books
under his arm, and rather than grapple
with Sconchin's legal talents the Judjr*
invariably dismissed the case. Several
years ago Sconchln left here and went to
New York, where he lived off the meager
generosity of his former friends. His
health broke down several months ago,
and since then Sconchin has been travel
ing the road that leads to the hereafter.

ton's possession of a $--â -> sewing ma
chine was duly noted and any suspicion
that she possessed diamonds was re
pudiated. The list as submitted by E.
Black Ryan was Interesting. It was a3
follows: Furniture, S4SSO; musical in
struments. $100; sewing machine, $25;
harness. $80; wagons and other ve
hicles, $275; libraries. law, medical and
miscellaneous, $250; coal, $20; paintings
and bric-a-brac, $8525; billiards, $100;
typewriter. $50; other property, $200;
total, $14,475.
This was the valuation which Hunt
ington's paid representative placed up
on the enormously valuable property In
the house on California and Taylor
streets. In his sworn statement Ryan
declared that the real property is worth
$74,400 and the improvements $37,800.
Assessor Dodge scanned the list very
carefully, but forgot that the paintings
owned by Huntington are alone Insured
for the great sum already indicated. If
the Assessor had taken the pains to in
quire he wo^ild have learned facts that
are not of general knowledge. In the
Huntington art collection there are two
of Murillo's works, each insured at
$75,000. There are two of Rousseau's,
each insured for $30,000. Greuze is rep
resented by a painting insured at $50,
--000, and there is in the California street
mansion one of Diaz' worth more than
$40,000. Two other pictures represent
$50,000, but the entire collection is as
sessed by Dodge at $28,525. The Asses
sor had not been altogether satisfied
with Ryan's appraisement of $8525 for
painting and bric-a-brac and had arbi
trarily raised the estimate to $28,525.
To this estimate has been added the
valuation of the real property and the
improvements, and upon the whole
Huntington pays $2659 95 in taxes.
Hi's wife, represented by "E. ' Black :
Ryan, swears that she possesses in San
Francisco, no wine, firearms or horses.
She has, so Ryan declares, no dia
monds, jewelry, plate or money, that
the Assessor of San Francisco may tax.
She has no stocks in corporations or in
railroads, and she pays taxes practical
ly upon one-tenth of her assessable
holdings in the city. This discrimina
tion, which works its evil upon less for
tunate taxpayers, shows with what j
fidelity the general' assessment has
been made in the city.
HE RESEMBLES
J. C. DUNHAM
Description of the Lou-
isvilie Suspect.
Sneclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 10.â Sheriff Lang-ford !
to-day received pictures and a description j
of the Dunham suspect recently arrested |
at Louisville, Ky., and there is a proba
bility that the right man has been ar- !
rested.- The photos bear a strong resem
blance to James C. Dunham, the mur- !
derer of the McGlincy family at Camp
bell.
The man, who gives his name as C. F.
Netterfield, has been hanging around |
Louisville for a couple of months. On ;
May 26 last Chief of Detectives Sullivan I
of that city notified Sheriff Langford that |
he was watching a man whom he sus- j
pected of being Dunham. Since then a
strict watch has been kept on the man,
and a few days ago the authorities be
came convinced they had the right man I
spotted, and he was arrested on a charge
of vagrancy to hold him until the local
officers could be heard from.
The following is-the letter received with
the photos:
Department of Police,
. CITY OF LOUISVILLE, August 6, 1899.
R. J. Langford, Sheriff. San Jos**, Cal.â Dear
Sir: Enclosed find photos of .a man arrested
here, who gives his" name as C. F. Netterfleld,
and we found on him letters addressed to that
name, but all dated prior to ISS<6, and not a
scrap or line to identify him since. We sus
pect the man to be James C. Dunham, wanted
by you for murder, as his forehead, eyes, nose,
mouth, chin and neck answer the description of
Dunham.
He is 5 feet 10 Inches tall In his bare
feet, weighs l."6V_ pounds, has a brown mus
tache, dark chestnut hair. He gives his age as
45, but looks to be about 36 years old. He has
exceedingly large wrists and forearms. The
suspect ls addicted to the morphine habit, and
while under the Influence of the drug admitted
in his conversation he was wanted in California
for murder. From his talk he has been in
Mexico, the Rocky Mountains and all over the
country. Wire me if he ls James C. Dunham,
and If he is send warrant. Very respectfully,
WILLIAM J. SULLIVAN.
Chief of Detectives.
The pictures bear the - closest resem
blance to Dunham of any yet received.
H. L. Miller, who knew Dunham inti
mately, says there is a strong probability
of the man being Dunham. There Is that
peculiar droop to the left eye that marked
Dunham, and the description of Netter- I
field In all manner fits.
The fact that letters of Identification I
were found on the man bearing date prior
to 1596 is one of the strongest arguments j
In the matter. Dunham committed his
crimes on May 26, 1896, and if he is the
man wanted he probably made these let
ters to ward off suspicion in case of ar
rest.
That he is addicted to morphine is also j
thought to be another link In the evi
dence. The pictures show the inroad the I
drug has made on the man, but many I
think it Dunham. They argue that a '
man with the enormity of Dunham's
crimes hanging over his head would take
to liquor or some drug.
Netterfleld admits having been in Mexico
and also states that he in wanted for mur
der in California. Shortly after the mur
der Sheriff Lyndon received information, I
that was considered of a positive nature, !
that Dunham had made his way into I
Mexico, but a thorough search failed to !
reveal him.
No action has yet been taken in the
matter, but undoubtedly the Board of
Supervisors will be asked for authority
to send a man East to see if the man is
really Dunham.

I^l with the Arions of the Pacific,
I ' and a programme of six days'

the local organization for' the enter

Preparations for the reception and the
festivities to follow have been under
way for several months, and when the
visitors arrive this evening on the
northern overland train everything will
be in readiness for them. They are
coming 155 strong, and of this number
twenty-five are members of the singing
section of the society. *. $
These societies are not members of
any general organization. It was
merely by a happy coincidence that
the German residents or this city or
ganized some years ago a -social and
musical society and christened it the
Arion Club, to learn some time later
that a similar society with the same
name had been formed in the Empire
City. Naturally a fraternal feeling
sprang up between the two clubs,
which resulted in a bond of friendship
growing between the Arions of the
East and the Arions of the West, few
of whom have had the pleasure of a
personal acquaintance.
The Eastern Arions will be met this
evening at Benicia by a delegation
from the local society, headed by
President Jacob F. Plagemann and Dr.
Max Magnus, chairman of the musical
section and in charge of the pro
gramme of festivities. -Upon their ar
rival at the ferry depot, foot of Market
street, they will be met by the German
singing societies of the city, who will
accord them a musical welcome to the
Western metropolis and escort them to
the headquarters of the Arjons at 414
Pine street, where there will be an in
formal reception. At 9:30 in the even
ing there will be a serenade in the
court of the Palace Hotel, where the
visitors will stop during their stay in
the city. There will be three numbers
by a chorus of 150 voices from the
Harmonic Teutonia and Arion socie

Following the serenade there will
be a reunion at the Arion Club for

DESTROY A BUILDING
SCENE OF ACCIDENT ON ILLINOIS STREET, NEAR NINETEENTH
THE saloon of John Kunltz, on Il
linois street, near Nineteenth,
received a shock yesterday after
noon at 1:30 o'clock that nearly
wrecked the entire building. One of
"the biggest boxcars used for freight
ing jumped the rails in front of the
saloon and went tilting up against
the building, churning everything in
the house like so much butter. The
car was heavily packed with sugar in
barrels and weighed many thousands
of pounds, another car rolled over
the bank just above Kunltz's place,
.the entire top being thrown outward
and many tons of sugar in sacks
being dumped upon the ground.
A Chinese Holiday.
The â¢ Little Woman's Festival was ob- j

their long journey to continue the fes
tivities into the night.
Saturday forenoon the Easterners
will be taken in carriages to all points
of Interest in the city, winding up with
a trip through the park and out to the
Cliff House, In the evening com
mencing at 8 o'clock, "commers" will
occupy the time of the visitors and
their entertainers until midnight.
"Commers" is the German for high
jinks, ami on this occasion the enter
tainment will be for the ladies as well
as the gentlemen. This part of the
programme will take place at Odd Fel
lows' Hall, and it is the intention of
the local Arions to make it one of the
principal features of the festivities.
The steamer Piedmont has been
chartered to take the Arions around
the bay Sunday. It will leave the ferry
depot at 9 o'clock in the morning. The
steamer will go out to the heads and
as far up the bay as Mare Island.
Monday and Tuesday the visitors will
be permitted to enjoy themselves ac
cording to their own inclinations. The
festivities will close Wednesday with
an excursion to the summit of Mount
Tamalpais.
Before leaving California the New
York Arions will visit Monterey and
the Yosemite Valley, and will return
to their Eastern home by way of the
The cause of the accident was a
springing of the rails. A Southron
Pacific freight train of about seven
cars was being hauled from the sugar
refinery on the point along Illinois
street when two of . the rear boxcars
jumped the rails. The brakeman in
the forepart of. the train did not no
tice the accident at the time of its
occurrence, and the derailed cars
dragged and cut Into the track from
Twenty-first to Twentieth street be
fore either one capsized. Between
Nineteenth and Twentieth the first
derailed car tilted over and was only
stopped from turning completely by
Kunltz's house. The second car
event is In commemoration of the descent
of the Joss upon earth, which occurred
countless ages ago. The celebration was
participated in only by young women,
who visited from house to house, carry-

DID COLEMAN SEEK
SYMPATHY OR DEATH?
An Ensign on the lowa Makes an Awk
ward Attempt Upon His Life,
A Career of V/ine and Unpaid Debts Led to
Charges and Court- Martial Which
. He Dared Not Face.
NOAH T. COLEMAN, an ensign
aboard the battleship lowa, at
tempted suicide by shooting, at
10 o'clock Wednesday night
while confined to his quarters
waiting trial by court-martial. Ensign |
Coleman's injuries will not keep him
long confined. His hair was consider
ably singed and the bullet which he
fired at himself out of a Colt's navy
revolver flew harmlessly by his head
and found lodgment in the ceiling ovei
his bunk. ;
Of the reasons for his rather awk
ward attempt at self-destruction the j
officers of the boat decline to speak, j
As soon as it was discovered that news j
of the affair had reached shore orders i
were issued by Captain Terry that no
newspaper representatives should be j
allowed aboard and every man from j
Jackie up was instructed to say abso- !
lutely nothing of the affair. Shore leave
was limited last night to only those of
the crew who could be trusted to keep
close-mouthed upon the ship's affairs.
Those of Coleman's fellow officers ;
who speak of the matter at all smile
when suicide is suggested; they incline
to the belief that his attempt was a
bungling play for sympathy rather
than a bona-fide effort at good marks
manship. Coleman's trial, which was
to have occurred before the court- I
martial sitting on the Badger, was to ;
have been upon serious charges, which
were the natural result of the career he
has led since 1893.
Among. naval people he has the repu
tation of a good fellow, but a hard
drinker and not to be altogether relied
upon in matters of business. He was
appointed an ensign from New York
in 1891 and in 1893 was made the junior â 
member of the examining board sta- J
tioned at .the Carnegie Iron Works to
inspect Government armor plate made j
at the Bethlehem mills.
The history of that board and the
scandal that attached to it those of
the navy circle still dislike to discuss.
There was every evidence of collusion
to defraud the Government between
the officers and the Carnegie Com
pany's manipulators and as a result of
it the board was finally withdrawn and
charges brought against individual
members, of whom Coleman was one.
As is usual with matters which attack ,
the honor of the navy the affair was J
finally lost sight of and the officers ,
were never brought to trial, but the â 
record has always clung to Coleman ,
and hampered him. it is said, in his
efforts to secure promotion.
It also left him with a big lawyer's
bill and with other debts which he has j
since been trying to pay off and at the ,
same time live a peg or so ahead of his
income. It is said he has scattered I j
O U'a in nearly every port where he i
was possessed of friends or social ac- j

ARREST OF A SUPPOSED BICYCLE
THIEF.
After Giving- a Fictitious Name He Is

named Menson, who has a cyclery at 642
Golden Gate avenue, and sold the -wheel
for $7 CO. As he failed to return with the
bicycle Menson became alarmed and no
tified the police.
Yesterday Purcey visited another
cvclerv on Larkln street, near McAllister,
and after announcing that he was anxious
to meet a relative in San Jose rented
a wheel. Shortly after leaving the
cvlerv Purcey rode to a pawnshop on
Third street and attempted to dispose of

quaintances, and it is also stated that
he has not always considered his hotel
bill a preferred account. Matters of
this sort have been called to the atten
tion of the commander of the ship since
her return to this port and following
close upon matters of a more serious
aspect, of which the ship's officers re
fuse to speak, his arrest and the order
for court-martial followed.
As a result of his alleged attempt at
suicide it is probable that the original
charge will be temporarily withdrawn
and that of insanity be placed against
1 him. It is the one loophole through
which he may retire from the navy
without th stigma of dishonorable
charges attaching either to him or his
ship, and it was understood last night
that this chance would be given him.
He is still confined to his quarters and
will remain so until his trial takes
place.
