in which the Boers lost more men than
they did at Majuba Hill, is held to prove
that their shooting is not so good as it
is reputed to be. It is the general be

HEAVY FIGHTING
NORTH OF MAFEKING
LONDON. Oct. 17.â special dispatch
from Pretoria, dated October 14, by way
of Delagoa Bay, says: A cyclist dispatch
was received from Ottosheep, near Mal
mani, at 6 o'clock asserting that heavy
fighting had been in progress all day long
north of Mafeking. The British troops
on board an armored train acted as a
covering force for the engineers engaged
in repairing the track. A Maxim on the
train kept up a continuous fire.
Conspicuous bravery was displayed on
both sides, but it soon became apparent
that the rifles of the burghers were in
effective against an armored train. The
latter, however, was once forced to re
treat before a particularly strong assault,
but it soon returned, accompanied by a
British mounted contingent, and the
fighting was renewed fiercely.
Fighting still continues, the Boers hold
ing their positions well. A dozen Boers
were killed or wounded, but the British
casualties cannot be ascertained.
Heavy firing can be heard south of
Mafeking, where General Cronje's com
mando is operating.
A corps of experienced continental en
gineers, former officers, has left Pretoria
for the southwestern borders, escorted by
a commando of picked Poet shot". % It 'Js
probably intended for large dynamite op
erations.
A big engagement Is expected shortly In
the vicinity of Ladysmith. The forces of
Commandant Piet Vys are encamped on a
mountain overlooking Dundee, from
which point they will be able to observe
the movements of the British troops.

and wounding seven. The British had no
losses.
LONDON, Oct. 17.â skirmish near
Spytsfontein, says a special dispatch
from Cape Town, was quite lively. The
armored train with a detachment of
Lancashires approached unmolested until
within range and then the Boers opened
fire. The Maxims were strongly set to
work and did good execution among the
burghers. The latter also used artillery,
but ineffectively. The armored train re
turned to Kimberley unharmed.
The crew of the armored train say the
Boers fired thirteen shells,. but their aim
was wretched and not a single shot
struck the train, which then made bold
to approach nearer and opened fire with
the Maxims. The burghers replied with
heavy rifles, again shooting wildly. Only
three or four bullets struck the train.
Subsequently the crew learned that Aye
Boers and two Boer horses were killed
while several Boers and horses were
wounded. Not a member of the British
force was so much as touched
PRELIMINARY BATTLES
IN THE BOER ADVANCE
PRETORIA. Oct. 14 (Delayed in trans
missions-Heavy fighting took place this
morning north of Mafeking. An armored

which nine British were wounded
Yesterday while General Cronje's troops
were near the broken railway bridge nine
miles north Â° Mafeking an approaching
train loaded with dynamite was fired upon
and blown up. There were no casualties
on the Transvaal side.
Further dispatches received by the Gov
ernment say that the fighting continues
north of Mafeking. The British, after the
second engagement, retired in the direc
tion of the town, but the.v resumed the at

SHAMROCK CRIPPLED AND
COLUMBIA HAS A "WALKOVER."
TOPMAST OF THE CUP CHALLENGER CARRIED AWAY.
After the Shamrock had crossed the starting line yesterday this accident caused her enormous club topsail, with its 3000 feet of canvas, to fall to the deck.
This catastrophe caused the Shamrocks captain to at once abandon the race. ,
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Another vic
tory for Columbia! Bat public in
terest will hardly survive another
triumph of the sort. It lapsed
with the fall of the challenger's
topmast, and though a part of the excur
sion fleet followed the Columbia in her
solitary ramble around the triangular
course there were few to grow enthus
iastic over a victory which accident had
rendered certain. . Nor was there any ap
plause for the Columbia when after that
mishap to the Shamrock the defender con
tinued upon her course. "Magnificent, but
it is not war," was a soldier's comment
on Balaklava. Mr. Iselin was plainly
within his rights when he rounded out
the run and claimed the victory, for Sir
Thomas Lipton is signatory to an agree
ment wherein It is stipulated that in case
of accident to either yacht the other
shall continue on her course and be cred
ited with a race should she finish. There
is a deep-seated instinct which protests
against the acceptance of victory through
the unsuspected weakness of a piece of
rigging worn by a rival craft. The hope
was freely expressed that the Columbia
would not claim and would not take he
rights. But when lt was seen that there
was no intent of relinquishing the ad
vantage gained there was a fervent hope,
and one freely and frequently expressed,
that the wind would die out and thus
prevent the winning of a race through
the mishap to a rival. -..*,;-
To every one who went out the disap
pointment: was keen. A fairer yachting
day could hardly be imagined. Moreover,
It was the sort of day that the Shamrock
people have been wishing for, a J fresh
wind blowing true and a lively sea run
ning before it. The race Itself over the
triangular course was another feature
which attracted many. All : previous ef
forts in this series have been fifteen miles
to the windward or leeward route, but the
course of to-day was to be over the tri
angular run, and in the fresh winds and
tumbling seas the contest promised to be
as thrilling as any ever witnessed in these
waters.
In pure gayety of spirit the excursion
ists cheered and shouted and waved
handkerchiefs and hats when the two
racers,; with boom and spar buckling to
the strain of swollen canvas, went storm
ing across the starting line. A more ani
mated yachting picture was never wit
nessed than that presented by these splen
did yachts dashing along the course, the
foam dancing in brilliant rainbows about
their weather bows, while to leeward the
water swept in glassy curves from the
clear knife-like stems. Under mainsail,
club topsails, jib, baby jib and staysails
the two j clipped it along, - both pointing
high and footing so fast that some of the
excursion boats had difficulty in keeping
pace. But all set out in pursuit of the
winged racers, and all were rejoicing in
the prospect of, a glorious struggle, when
hopes were dashed by the accident to the
Shamrock. She was then the focus for
all eyes, for to the many It seemed that
she. was outfooting the cup defender, and
it appeared also that she had reached out
far, enough to cross the Columbia's bow.
A number were expecting that she would
attempt that maneuver and were watch
ing | the challenger with intense interest,
when a cry of dismay arose. Bending to
the weight -of the club topsail the Sham
rock's topmast suddenly snapped and fell,
precipitating -the, sail's spar into a mass
of â  wreckage, . which, suspended 'â  by Its
â wire rigging, swung ?to and fro with the
movement of the yacht. V . - V
' The disabled cutter was promptly head
ed Into the wind, and efforts were quickly
made to secure the splintered mast and
bagging topsail before it had done any in
jury to the mainsail. The Erin, with Sir
Thomas Lipton on board, promptly stood
toward her crippled consort, at the same
time making signals to the Shamrock's
tender, the tugboat Lawrence. That ves
sel headed for the crippled yacht, and as
soon as the wreckage had been secured a
tow line was made fast and the two were
headed back to port. The Erin followed
and as the procession moved silently by
the excursion fleet opened up its whistles
and all the passengers cheered the unfor
tunate vessel and her plucky owner. The
Erin ranged near to the Shamrock, and
Sir Thomas Lipton spoke encouragingly
to Captain Hogarth, who seemed to feel
the accident very keenly.
To newspaper men Captain Hogarth
would not attempt any explanation. All
that he cared to say was that he was glad
the broken mast had not come down on
deck and that he was pleased no one was
injured. '.'^
Apparently afraid that she would meet
with a similar mishap, the skipper of the
Columbia immediately after the breaking
of the Shamrock's topmast ordered her
baby jib taken in.
-The Columbia, however, made a fine
race of it, plucklly holding on to her club
topsail throughout and setting her bal
loon jib in the final reach for home. Her
time was little short of marvelous. She
covered the course in 3 hours 37 minutes,
the beat ten miles to windward in 1 hour
39 minutes 11 seconds, the reach to the
second mark In 53 minutes 59 seconds, and
the last leg In I hour 3 minutes 50 seconds.
As she crossed the finish line she let go her
head sails and one of the Deer Isle sailors
treated the spectators to an exhibition of
daring as he climbed out over the peak
halliards eighty feet In the air to loose the
club topsail. i.;Â« Â».*._ *c"\'".'-V
Mr. Iselin, when seen after the Colum
bia had run her race and reached her
moorings, said that he much regretted
the accident. Sir Thomas Upton de
clared emphatically that the Columbia
was entitled to the race, and that Mr.
Iselin had a perfect right to claim it. Tne
two defeats have not discouraged him,
however. He has another chance and he
hopes to make that one count. The
ShEhnrock . was towed to Erie Basin,
where necessary repairs will be made.
After the new topmast has been put in
place the vessel will be remeasured and
will be ready for the contest Thursday.
That is to be the old fifteen miles to
windward or leeward and back, and if the
Columbia wins the series will have been
completed without* giving the Shamrock
an opportunity 7 to test her merits In her
favorite* point of sailing over a triangular
course. â 7777 y'y
TECHNICAL STORY OF
THE ONE-SIDED RACE
Owing to the Injury to the Shamrock
the Next Contest Is Postponed
.One Day. ._
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Clear weather
and a fine whole sail breeze greeted the
skippers and : crews of. the racing yachts
when they turned to Â« this morning. An
early start was the order and both yachts
.were towing out past the j point of the
Hook at 9 o'clock. The Shamrock's main
sail was hoisted soon after, and at 9:20 she
, cast off her towline, broke out her Jib and.

filled away to starboard at a point mid
way between Scotland and Sandy Hook
lightships. The Columbia continued In
tow until well up to the Sandy Hook
lightship, and at 9:25 o'clock her crew set
the mainsail in eight minutes. As soon as
the sail was up she cast off her towline
and set what appeared to be her No. 2
club topsail, not the largest one she has.
The club topsail which the Shamrock
began* to set at 9:40 o'clock was appar
ently her largest one, the same one which
was bent on Monday to aluminum spars.
To-day wooden ones were used. With a
freshening breeze from the eastward and
an ugly swell rolling in from the same
quarter, it seemed a rather risky pro
ceeding to swing such a large topsail
aloft. . Subsequent events proved that
with a smaller club topsail the Shamrock
might have finished the race. The same
persons were on board the Columbia and
Shamrock as on previous race days and
when the committee boat arrived and an
chored northeast of the lightship at 10:20
o'clock the yachts were ready for the
start.
The signals for a triangular course were
set at 10:30 o'clock and one of the com
mittee boats was at once sent to log off
the first ten-mile leg and place the first
mark. The Course for the first leg was
east by south, for the second southwest
half south and for the third leg north
northwest. The first ten miles was to
windward, the second ten miles a reach
with boom. to starboard and the third a
reach with boom to port, thirty miles in
all. r
At 10:45, when the preparatory signal was
given, the yachts were maneuvering for
position, while the torpedo-boats and the
revenue cutters were driving out a few
excursion boats and yachts away from
the starting line. At the warning sig
nal, given at 10:55, the breeze had In
creased perceptibly and there was prom
ise of a good start in a few minutes. The
skipper of each yacht saw to it that tho
main sheets were kept well aft, so that
he could quickly gybe or tack his boat.
At one minute before the starting gun
the Shamrock, which had been maneu
vering southeast of the lightship, stood
to the northwest, closing in toward it.
Her boom was to port and well in board.
Coming up from the northward, also with
boom to port and wind abeam, the Co
lumbia met the Shamrock just as Ho
garth was getting ready to luff his yacht
sharp around the lightship's stern.
The situation at the gunfire was almost
exactly the same as that between the De
fender and Valkyrie 111 as they ap
proached the line on the day when the
Valkyrie fouled the Defender. When the
Shamrock, a moment after gunfire round
ed the lightship's stern and luffed sharp
up on the wind, the Columbia having been
unable to gain the weather berth, had
now an overlap of half her length on the
lee side of the Shamrock and so close
were they that the Shamrock's main boom
as she luffed to her course came danger
ously near the Columbia's weather shrouds
and masthead runner. Both yachts were
close hauled on the starboard tack, cross
ing the line on a diagonal course.
- The Shamrock had certainly the better
of the start and Columbia was placed In a
position that few yachts would be able to
extricate themselves from without either
keeping broad off or fouling. It was with
intense interest, then, that those. on the
accompanying yachts and excursion boats
watched the outcome* of this battle royal
between the slngle-sticKers.
One minute had not passed before the
Columbia's bowsprit began to show out
ahead of the Shamrock's. At 11:02, when
the handicap gun was fired the Columbia
was half a length out from under the lee
of her rival, and thirty seconds later when
the Shamrock tacked to port to get clear
of the Columbia's backwind the latter
yacht, by ; tacking five seconds later,
placed herself in a commanding position
on the Shamrock's weatner quarter.
The official time of the start was: Sham
rock, 11:00:15; Columbia, 11:00:17.
The wind was east by south and fresh2
NEWS FLASHED ASHORE
BY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
NEW TORK, Oct. 17.â News of the Shamrock's misfortune ln losing her
topmast was flashed ashore by Signor Marconi within a few seconds
of the accident. While observers on shore endeavored in vain to peer
through the haze, and even those on the Mackay-Bennett cable
steamer, anchored four miles away, were in doubt as to what had
happened, watchers on the Grande Duchesse saw the challenger's spar
topple and fall. ' Before any attempt could be made to clear away the wreck
age a bulletin had been sent by wireless telegraphy to the Herald and The
Call .'.: 7\
As in Monday's race, and on days when attempts to race had been made,
Signor Marconi "led with Th.- news. Every feature was reported from the
time when the competing yachts began maneuvering for position at the
start to the solitary finish of the Columbia.* There were many -Wall street
operators on board, who Improved the opportunity to see a yacht race and
at the same time keep In touch with ths stock market.
On the way down the bay Signor Marconi tested his apparatus and
made the necessary adjustments. When the two yachts approached the
starting line their Jockeying for positions, the sails they carried and the
direction and force of the wind were reported. As the contestants crossed
the line nearly abeam the time of the tart was flashed ashore. When the
torpedo-boat Dupont fired a gun to compel the yacht Vamoose to obey an
order tv go outside the guard line Signor Marconi alone telegraphed the news
ashore. The fact that a boat was lowered and that the Vamoose was taken
In charge was also reported. This was one of the many incidents in a day's
working of wlreles* telegraphy.
According to watches held on the Grande Duchesse the accident to the
Shamrock' happened at 11:20. A minute 40 seconds later a bulletin was posted In
front of the Herald and The Call oflices. While the disabled topmast dangled
In the air threatening to punch in the Shamrock's mainsail, excursionists
crowde.l about the entrances to the room from which Signor Marconi was
sending his reports. Every ono was anxious that the outside world should
receive the earliest and most complete .-tory of the accident, and knew that
it must be sent from the Grande Duchesse. Among other news bulletins
received from the shore on the Grande Duchesse was one announcing the
report of an alleged battle at Mafeking, with the loss of three hundred
Uvea to the Boers and einhteon to the British.
Returning from Hampton Roads, the cruiser New York and the battleships
Massachusetts and Indiana reached this port to-day. The Indiana anchored
off Tompkinsville. The New York and Massachusetts cast anchor off Thirty
fifth street, in North River. It has been reported from official sources that
the New York and Massachusetts, as soon as Signor Marconi has finished
reporting the yacht races for the Herald and The Call, will be equipped by
him with wireless telegraphy. An exhaustive test of the system will then
be made by the Government by experiments off Sandy Hook.
ening by degrees as the yachts stood I
along on a northeast by Boteth course.
They were taking the easterly swells
rather hard at times, plunging their tow
sprits clear under and doubtless putting
t.i a severe test all the spars and rigging.
With half an eye any sailor could see
looking at the yachts end-on from astern
the Columbia was lying, say, from half to
three-quarters of a point higher than the
Shamrock, both apparently having their
sheets trimmed alike on this port tack, j
The fact that the Shamrock carried no
baby jlbtopsail ! was excellent evidence
that her captains were afraid that if set I
it would pull her head off more yet, bo |
it was kept down, while the Columbia's, j
setting perfectly on Its stay, must have
helped that yacht instead of retarding ]
her In the windward work. Fifteen min
utes after the start the Columbia's posi- j
tion was fully 2 1 " 1 yards dead to wind
ward of the Shamrock, the latter being
at that time slightly forward of the Co- |
lumbia's lee beam.
Captain Barr evidently meant to con- j
tinue on the port tack to Liverpool, If ,
necessary, until the Shamrock came j
about. That never happened, however,
for as the breeze freshened and both :
yachts began to put their lee rails down j
harder it seemed, looking at the Sham
rock's topmast from astern, as if It were
sprung. At 11:24, with a crash that could !
be heard far off to leeward, the Sham- .
rock's topmast broke at a point close to
the cap, and the great club topsail with
long spars went flying down to leeward
of the mainsail. Swinging the long tiller
across her stern to port. Captain Ho
garth Immediately put the Shamrock be
fore the wind, and, finding that do one
on board was hurt, he gybed her and all
hands began clearing away the wreckage.
The foresail was taken in first and men
were sent aloft to overhaul the club top
sails, sheets and and halyards and clear
away the topmast backstays and other
gear. It was some fifteen minutes be
fore they were able to get the club top
sail down On deck. It was found that the
direct cause of the accident was the part
ing of the foremast shroud in the "nip"â
that is, the portion of this steel wire, rope
resting in the spread which extends out
board from the hounds of the lower
mast. The strands of the wire easily
chafe and rust at that point, especially
when the shroud ls slacked by reason of
being to leeward.
That, ended the race so far as the Sham
rock 'was concerned.
The Columbia took In her baby Jib top- i
sail and continued on her course, tacking 1
to starboard at 11:25. for it had been spe- .
cially agreed a few days prior to the date
set for the first race that In the event of
an accident to either yacht the uninjured |
vessel was to complete the course. This j
agreement was signed by Mr. Iselin and |
Sir Thomas Upton. .It was a great pity, ;
of course, that such an accident should
have happened at such a time, .when
everything looked promising for a good |
triangular race. '-.*â¢ I
At the time of the accident the Colum- \
bia was about an eighth of a mile to the
windward of the Shamrock.
The steam yacht Erin, with Sir Thomas
Lipton and party on board, followed the
Shamrock back to Sandy Hook while she
was towed by her tender. On her way in
the Erin was passed by the steam yacht
Oneida. Former Commodore F. C. Bene
dict was on the bridge. He hailed Sir
Thomas through the megaphone and said:
"I am very sorry to see the accident and
I am sorry that the race Is to be won in
that way. We should all be more pleased
to see the yachts sail it out."
. Sir Thomas thanked him and passed on
in his yacht. For thirty-eight minutes
and forty-five seconds the Columbia con
tinued on the starboard tack. She had '
taken in her Jib topsail soon after the ac- j
cident to the* Shamrock so as to relieve
,the topmast of any unnecessary strain. In |
twenty-two minutes she went about again i
to starboard and eleven minutes later she !
made her last tack for the first mark. In j
three and a half minutes she was up to '
the mark and keeping off. rounded lt. As i
she eased sheets to starboard a No. 2 Jib ;
topsail was broken out and the white
yacht began her ten-mile reach for the '
second mark. Her official time at the turn
was 12:39:28, showing that she had cov
ered the distance to windward, about
fourteen miles, In one hour, thirty-nine
minutes and eleven seconds.
The reach to the second mark was de
void of interest, for the Columbia simply i
sailed her course of southwest half south |
straight as a die. only chancing her fore I
staysail for a ballooner at 1:13. She con- 'â¢
tinued to carry her Jib topsail until the '
second mark was nearly reached. The j
second mark was gybed around In 1:33:27, !
Her elapsed time for this leg was 63 mm- ;
utes 39 seconds, a little better than ten
miles an hour.
Setting the balloon Jib topsail a few
minutes after rounding this mark, the I
Columbia headed north, northwest for the i
home mark. On this last leg of ten miles !
the wind lightened considerably and the |
yacht's speed was not as good as on the j
previous leg. It took her 1 hour 3 mm- ;
utes 60 seconds to cover the distance
The wind hauled a little to the westward ]
as she approached the finish line, so the i
balloon lib topsail was taken in and the '
small Jib topsail set. At 2:37:17 the Co- !
lumbia crossed the finish line between i
the red lightship and the committee |
boat, a winner of the second race of the
international series. She was greeted by <
the usual steam whistle applause and was
soon after towed to her moorings in the
Horseshoe, back of Sandy Hook.
When the committee "boat arrived in

NEW YORK, Oct. After her mis

to Erie Basin, first going to the Horse
shoe. On the way *ip she was passed by
a multitude of steam craft. The story
of her misfortune was evident to all as
the crowds lined the sides. One English
outward-bound steamer dipped her colors
in a mournful salute. >
Once ln the Erie Basin she was warped
Up to the end of a pier next to an army
transport. The crew set to work at once.
The wreckage had been cleared away be
fore the ship loft the course, That was
about all that could be done, for the big
topsail had been torn and the standing
rigging was all badly wrenched. The
tender Plymouth had the men for this
work, and she arrived about 5 p. m., with
Mr. Ratsey on board. No time was lost.
The sailraakers were set at their labors
at once on the upper deck of the Ply
mouth, while the riggers went aboard.
By moonlight the crippled yacht Sham
rock was repaired to-night in Erie Basin!
Brooklyn. At midnight the new topmast
was In place and a new gaff ready to be
set. The new topmast is fifty-six feet
long and twelve Inches in diameter at Its
base. The gaff is sixty-. feet long
and of the same diameter.

MEDIATION YET
OUT OF THE QUESTION
WASHINGTON.' Oct. 17.â Representa- '
tives of the South African republic are
again in Washington, apparently for the
purpose of renewing their attempt to in- i
duce the United States to mediate in the
Transvaal war. General James R. !
O'Belrne, accredited by President Kruger
as High Commissioner to this country, I
and Mr. J. G. Robin, both of New York, '
are in Washington, but they did not call
at the State Department to-day. Even
should General O'Belrne call upon Secre
tary he will not get' recognition as a rep
resentative of the Transvaal, as Acting
Secretary Hill's decision not to receive
him as an official representative of a for- ;
eign state because of his American citi- j
zenship, has been approved by the Presi- !
dent and Secretary of State. He may j
have an Informal conference with Sec- |
retary Hay Just as he had an Informal
conversation with Dr. Hill but the reply I
to his representations will undoubtedly i
be what ft was beforeâ that the United :
States cannot consent to mediate unless !
Great Britain, as well as the Transvaal
should formally request It. It Is un- j
derstood that General O'Belrne has some
suggestions which he believes will re- :
ceive the approval of the administration i
when submitted. It is hardly necessary j
to add that President McKinley considers ;
war in South Africa too remote to war- !
rant interference, especially In view of I
the Injurious effect such interference j
would undoubtedly have upon the cordial i
relations now existing between the United |
States and Great Britain.

BRUTAL ARREST OF
AN AGED WIDOW
Mrs. Welsh Summarily
Sent to Jail.
__
Special Dispatch to T he Call.
SAN RAFAEL, bet. 17.â While on her
way home from church last Sunday
morning Mrs. Sarah Welsh, an aged
widow, was arrested on the street and
thrown into jail by Constables W. J. and
Frank Treanor because she had Incurred
their animosity by making the former's
children cease injuring her fence. Though
two respectable merchants came to the
old lady's rescue and furnished bail, the
so-called legal machinery was set in op
eration and a threat of Justice of the
Peace George Rodden so frightened the
poor old woman that she paid a fine and
went home crying bitterly at the dis
grace forced upon her.
This is the lirst case ln the history of
San Rafael where court was" held in the
rear room of a saloon, and so strong is
the indignation manifested that the affair
is the chief topic of conversation in every
public resort In town.
According to Mrs. Welsh's version, she
made Treanor's children get off her fence
on Saturday, and on Sunday, while on her
way home from church, was accosted by
W. .1 Treanor, who angered her by telling
her that she. would. have to remove the
trees In front of her property, with the
result that she called him a 'â¢ruffian and
a "beggar." At this juncture Frank
Treanor grasped Mrs. Welsh by the arm,
with the statement that she was drunk,
and dragged her before Justice Rodden.
where a charge of disturbing the peace
was placed against her by W. J. Treanor.
She was then taken to the County Jail,
but two citizens, named James Kenney
and E. H. Conway, promptly balled hei
out.
On Monday evening Mrs. Welsh was
taken into a parlor in the rear of Frank
Walsh's saloon, and there met â W. J.
Treanor and Judge Rodden. At Rodden'a
request, Mrs. Walsh told the aged de
fendant that it would cost her $2 50 for
every day she delayed the case. This
fact is admitted by Mrs. Walsh and has
excited most of the unfavorable comment,
as it was this threat that caused Mrs.
Welsh to pay a line of $5.
Treanor endeavors to excuse his action
on the score that the defendant called
him names. For Justice Hodden's act in
saying that it would cost Mrs. Welsh $2 s')
for every day the case was delayed no
excuse has been offered, but this occa
sions little surprise.
So strong is the feeling on account of
the unwarranted arrest and Intimidation
of Mrs. Welsh that it is probable the
affair will be drawn to the attention of
the Grand Jury. 1-7. Tl. Conway asserted
to-night that Mrs. Welsh was dragged
down a back street and thrown Into jail
before st complaint was entered or a war
rant Issued. The complaint was filed at
the bondsmen's request, so that ball could
be given. Mr. Kenney was so Indignant
that It required considerable persuasion
to induce him not to thrash the Treanors.
Both men who were eye-witnesses of
the affair pronounce It the greatest out
rage they ever witnessed.
FIREMEN'S LIFE CRUSHED

I est building In the city, was in the path j
' of the flames and was destroyed together
I with the buildings occupied by E. O. An

ELOPED WITH ANOTHER
MAN TO SAN FRANCISCO
NEW YORK. Oct. 17.â Theodore Bauer
of Brooklyn has made application to the
Supreme Court for' an absolute divorce
from his wife, Sophie Bauer. She aban
doned him, he alleges, on May 11 of. last
year, and he has succeeded in tracing her
to San Francisco: Service of summons in
his suit has been made by publication.
Gustave A. Bunge is named by Mr.
Bauer as the man who broke up his home,
and he Is said to be Mrs. Bauer's compan
ion now.
Bauer alleges that the acts of which he
complains were committed on the steam
ship Advance of the Panama Railway
Company during a voyage from New Yonit
to Colon, and at 96 South Park, San Fran
cisco.
Previous to leaving this city with
Bunge. it is alleged by Mr. Bauer, his
wife lived at 565 Third avenue and in Ken
slco, this State. Her cousin, who lives in
the last-named â  place, gave information
that she had gone out of the State. '.The
Chief of Police of San Francisco was
communicated with and 'he wrote that
Mrs. Bauer was there and called herself

DILLON DENOUNCES THE WAR
AS. UNJUST AND COWARDLY
LONDON, Oct. 17.â Parliament opened
to-day in extraordinary session to
consider the South ' African situa
tion. In the speech from* the
throne, her Majesty said:
My Lord, and Gentlemen: Within a very
brief period after the recent prorogation I am
compelled by events deeply affecting the Inter
ests of my empire to recur to your advice and
aid. The state of affairs in South Africa has
made it expedient that my Government should
be enabled to strengthen the military forcc-^of
this country bj calling out the reserve. I- Or
thin purpose the provisions of the law tender
it necessary that Parliament should be called
together. Except for the differences that have
been caused by the action of the South African
republic the condition of the world continues to
be peaceful. ?--;â¢.'â -...!Â« ...
Gentlemen of the House of Commons: Meas
ures will Ije laid before you for the purpose of
providing for the expenditure which has been
or may be caused by events In South Africa.
Estimates for, the ensuing year will be sub
mitted to you In due course.
My Lords and Gentlemen: There are many
subjects of domestic Interest to which your at- ;
tention will be Invited at a later season, when
the season of labors for a parliamentary session
has been reached. For the present I have In
vited your dance In order to ask you to
deal with an exceptional exigency; and I pray
that, in performing the duties which claim your,
attention, you may have the guidance and i
blessings of Almighty God.
Both houses assembled in the Chamber !
of Peers at _! o'clock, the Queen's speech I
being read by commission, immediately ;
after the reading the Speaker of the |
House of Commons, the Right Hon. Wil
liam Court Gulley, returned to the Cham
ber of Commons, the House taking a re- !
cess mull 4 o'clock.
Large crowds waited ln the precincts of t
St. Stephen's for the reassembling of i
Lords and Commoners and heartily wel- ;
corned the favorites, especially Joseph '
Chamberlain Secretary of State for the
Colonies. The Prince of Wales was loud- |
ly cheered while driving to the House of 1
Lords.
Within the House cordial receptions
marked the arrival of Mr. Balfour and \
the other members of the Government, .
The House listened impatiently to the I
usual protest by James Lowther against j
the alleged interference of peers in elec- '
lions, but Mr. Chamberlain's coming nut
everybody in good humor and was the I
signal for an immense outburst of ap- ;
plause. He entered carrying a big dis- !
patch box. Mr. Balfour gave notice of a :
motion to-morrow that no private busi- |
ness should be taken up during the au- j
tumn session. â¢ . - - . |
The speaker then rend the Queen s
speech, shortly after which Sir Alexander |
Puller Acland Hood, Conservative mem
ber for West Somerset, rose to move the
address in reply. He wore the scarlet and
gold uniform of a captain of the Grena- |
diers. Sir Alexander Hood said the House |
had never met .under graver circum- |
stances, not only for South Africa but for j
the whole empire. Dwelling upon the
horrors of war, he declared that war
should not be undertaken except from
absolute necessity, but that in this case
all peaceable means having failed, war
had become necessary "to establish equal
rights for the white race in South Africa
and to remove the grievances of the Out
landers."
After reviewing the course of the nego
tiations between the British Government
and the Transvaal, he said that Presi
dent Kruger by his own act had removed
all chance of peace. After dwelling upon -
the splendid offers of assistance made by
the colonies and the "necessity of main- *
taining Great Britain's paramountcy," ho
animadverted upon the defiant language
of President Stern of the Orange Free
State, declaring that unless the question
of British supremacy was settled now
British rule In South Africa would go.
He asserted that the British Government
under exceptional provocation had shown
great patience and forbearance and that
Great Britain had now no option but to
repel attack.
Clement Royds, Conservative member ;
for Rochdale, seconded the address.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Liberal
leader in the House of Commons, who fol- ;
lowed Mr. yds, said Parliament had .
beep summoned to-glve its approval to the
early steps of war. Never had the house j
mi t" In circumstances more serious or j
amid conditions engaging ,to a greater de
gree the profound interest of the British I
people. The demands made by : the Gov
ernment of the South African' republic j
were such as to make it Impossible for the i
Government or any self-respecting coun
try ever to take them into consideration. i
"Actual hostilities have commenced," |
said Sir Henry, "and an active aggression
has been committed, which it is the plain ' !
duty of our Ministers, of Parliament and |
of the people to resist. There will be no
disposition on the part of this House to \
place any obstacle in the way of granting
such supplies and such powers â to the
crown as may be necessary to secure the
rapid and effective prosecution of a war
commenced to vindicate our rights. The
campaign should be vigorously and \
promptly prosecuted, and nothing neces
sary for that purpose should be refused
by the House of Commons."
The leader of the opposition went on to :
congratulate the Government upon the !
choice made of officers to whom the main :
charge of the "expedition" had been
given. Never, he believed, had so capable
and experienced a staff been dispatched !
from the shores of England.
"Our natural position in South Africa," I
he declared, "has placed upon us the duty
of seeing any impediment to our own \
supremacy removed. On that we are all .
agreed. i have no. intention of entering
upon a minute or delicate criticism of!
the steps taken by the Government. The
time for that has not yet come, and it .
is proper to wait for further explanations. j
But 1 may say it does appear to me that \
the governments are engaged In a game
of bluff (cheers and Ministerialist cries of
"No. no"), which is not a very worthy '
one for a great country like this. The J
raising of the suzerainty question was
utterly unnecessary and did more than ''
anything else to remove all chance of sue- !
cess of the negotiations."
Mr. Balfour, who was received with i
loud cheering, expressed satisfaction at
the declaration of Sir Henry Campbell- I
Bannerman, with which, he said, be was I
himself in heary agreement. Mr. Balfour
complained that while Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman insinuated that the war
was due to errors of the Government, he I
did not specify these errors. The Gov- I
ernment would like to have charges j
brought forward so that they could re- I
fute them. He repelled the allegation |
that the Government had goaded the l
South African republic Into war by flaunt- j
Ing Great Britain's suzerainty In their i
faces. The South African republic made
claims to being an Independent sovereign :
state, but these were Inconsistent with the
conventions of 1881 and 1884. Mr. Balfour
said ho could not understand Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman's declaration that
the Government had played a game of
bluff. ' â 7-7:y. -:",-â¢â .**
"Bluff," said the Government leader I
"means a person acting as though he 'held ;
cards he does not possess; but this coun- '
try holds tho cards and means to play i
them."
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, he
said, disapproved sending the troops to '
South Africa, an Irritating- menace to the
Boers. "But where would we not be but
for those troops? Not to have sent troops !
would have been to betray the country.
Mr. Balfour said further that he felt en- i
titled to say: "If war must come it has
seldom been entered Into by Great Britain
upon an issue which was more. clearly an :
issue of righteousness and liberty, and we
have undoubted proof that our self-gov- !
erning colonies beyond the seas are with -
us heart and soul."
John Dillon, Nationalist member of the I
East Division of Mayo, moved an amend- !
metn to the address as follows: ,
. "We humbly represent to her Majesty I
that the state of war now existing be
tween Great Britain and the South Afri- I
can Republic has been caused by the as- ;
sertion of claims which interfere with the I
Internal government of the republic, in di- I
rect violation of the terms of the conven
tion of ISS4, and by massing large bodies
of British troops on the frontier of the '
republic. We humbly submit that before I
more bloodshed takes place' a proposal be i
made In the spirit of the recent confer- j
ence at The Hague with a view, of finding I
in independent arbitration a settlement
of the differences between the two govern- I
ments, and ln order that an Ignominious !
war be thus avoided between the over- j
whelming forces of her Majesty's empire I
and those of two small nations number- i
ing altogether lass than 200. souls."
; Mr. Dillon claimed that his amendment '
would appeal to an overwhelming major
ity of the. civilized world outside of Eng
land. He wan proud, -he' said, 7 that Ire- i
land was against ' this "unjust and ' cow- ;
ardly war." (Nationalist cheers.)
"It ls not a war," he continued,". for the '
freedom of the Outlanders, but a war i
against the yoke of Cecil Rhodes being
put" upon these poor people." (Cries' or "
"Oh.") . â¢
Mr. Dillon asserted that the Govern.
ment was breaking the convention be
cause gold had been discovered in the
Transvaal. '-,77 â¢
Henry Labouchere, Liberal member for
Northampton, seconded the amendment,
leclaring the war the absolute act of Mr.
Chamberlain..
"If there had been no Rhodes, 'or if
Lord Salisbury had been in the Colonial
Oflice," said Mr. Laboucherei "there
would have been no war. i There is too
much of the Stock Exchange about the
whole business."
Michael Davitt, member for South
Mayo, vigorously supported the ' amend
ment, declaring that outside of Jingo cir
cles and stock jobbing rings the whole
British empire cried shame. The result
of a war between a giant and a dwarf
would bring neither honor nor prestige to
British arms. Â:.,:...,.-: :.
William Redmond, Parnellite member
for the East Division of Claire, main
tained everything he had already said in
Ireland against the iniquity of the war.
It would be a sorry thing, lie declared, for
the dignity of the oath of allegiance If it
compelled those who took it to acquiesce
in every act ,of a jingo government.
Sir Ellis Ashmead Bartlett. Conserva
tive, representing the Ecclesall Division
of Sheffield, predicted that within five
fears after the struggle the Dutch popu
ation of the Cape, the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State would be perfectly
contented and happy.
After some sharp passages between
Colonel Edward J. Saunderson, who sits
for North Armagh in the Conservative in
terest, and the Irish members, a divi
sion was taken on Mr. Dillon's amend
ment, which was rejected by a vote of 722
to 64.
The minority consisted mainly of Irish
members and a few Radicals, including
Mr. Henry Labouchere, Mr. P. J. Stan
lope and Mr. E. H. Pickersgill and others.
The majority included the occupants of
the front opposition bench and the bulk
of the Liberals.
The House of Lords reassembled at 4
o'clock, the floor and galleries being
crowded. The Prince of Wales sat ami*
the cross benches and there were many
peeresses ln the galleries. The Marquis
of Granby, in moving the address of the
peers in reply to the Queen's speech, said
that the present situation had been
brought about by the deliberate action of
the Transvaal and Orange Free State
governments. Difficulties ' had been ac
cumulating for years. They were not the
creation of a day. He went on to dwell
upon the grievances of the Outlanders,
and emphatically declared that the Brit
ish Government has resorted to every pos
sible means of effecting a peaceful Issue
After criticising the action of the Trans
vaal executive council in sending the ul
timatum, the Marquis of Granby ob
served that it was not "impossible that
the union of the two states originated
in some deeper scheme which may have
lurked in the minds of the two govern
ments for some time.
"This scheme for a Joint movement."
he continued, "is not aided, I trust, by
Afrikanders in other parts of Sonth
Africa; but, if it exists, it is one that
would tend seriously to impair the power
of Great Britain. Unanimous feeling
here, however. is that the paramount
power in South Africa should be - Great
Britain." '-'- ; .-'.\7 7
Baron Barnard seconded the address.
The Earl of Kimberley, the Liberal
leader, said Parliament had been sum
moned at a solemn moment when Britons
found themselves engaged in a war which
was, in some of itÂ» aspects, a civil war.
Of course. it was not civil war precisely,
but it was a war in which a number of
British subjects, not of the English race,
were deeply engaged.
Regarding the calling out of the re
serves and the voting of supplies, he con
tinued: "I can speak with no doubtful
voice. Whatever may be our opinions as
to the past history of this melancholy
business, we are as ready as the usual
supporters of the Government to give our
support to whatever measure may be nec
essary to vindicate the honor of* the em
pire and to protect its interests."
Lord Kimberley said the Government
could not have sent any other reply than
it did send to the extraordinary ulti
matum of the Transvaal. He warmly
praised the readiness of the reserves and
expressed entire confidence that the Brit
ish soldier would do his duty In South
Africa in the future as he had done every
where In the past.
"There are some points in the negotia
tions, however," observed his lordship,
"which I have not viewed with satisfac
tion. The .negotiations have not oeen con
ducted in a prudent and certainly not in
a successful manner. My own interpre
tation of the word 'suzerainty' is that
there are in the London convention cer
tain stipulations which limit British sov
ereignty in the Transvaal and to the ex
tent of these limitations there is con
structive suzerainty."
Lord Kimberley in closing criticized the
tone of Mr. Chamberlain's recent
speeches. â â -.-_ -"..-â¢
The Premier, the Marquis of Salibury
replying to Lord Kimberley's criticisms of
the negotiations, said:
"The Boer Government was pleased to
dispense with any negotiations on our
part respecting the causes or justifica
tion of the war. They have done what no
provocation on our part could have Jus
tified. 1 hey have done what the strong
est nation has never in its strength done
to any opponent it had challenged. They
issued a defiance so audacious that 'l
could scarcely depict it without using
words unsuited for this assembly, and by
so doing they liberated this country from
the necessity of explaining to the people
of England why we are at war. But for
this no one could have predicted that we
would ever be at war. There have been
very grave questions between us, but up
to the time of the ultimatum the modes
we suggested of settling them were suc
cessful and the spirit in which we were
met was encouraging. We lat#ly had
hoped that the future had in reserve for
us a better fate.
"But now all question of possible peace
all question of justifying the attitude we
had assumed and all question of point
ing out the errors and the grave op
pression of which the Transvaal Govern

"It is a satisfactory feature of our
policy during these later days that on
questions involving the vital interest* and
honor of the country there are no distinc
tions of party."
His Lordship said be believed that a
desire to get rid of the word "suzerainty"
and the ! reality which It expressed had
been the controlling desireâ the dream of
President Kruger"s life. It was for that
the President of the Transvaal had set up
the negotiations of 1534, and In order to
get that hateful word out of the conven
tion he, had made considerable sacrifices
Mr. Kruger -has used oppression of the
Outlanders as a screw to obtain a con
cession on the subject' of suzerainty
"I quite agree," he remarked, "that the
word suzerainty Is not necessary for Great
Britain's present purpose. Situated __.%
Great Britain Is In South Africa toward
the Transvaal and Outlanders. she ha*
a duty to fulfill which has nothing to do
with any convention or any question of
suzerainty. This word, however, being
put into the treaty, obtained an artificial
value and meaning which has prevented
Great Britain entirely abandoning It If
Great Britain dropped It she would be In
timating that she also repudiated and
abandoned the Ideas attached to It. It
was largely due to the character of Mr
Kruger and to the Ideas pursued by him
that we have been led step by step to the
present moment, when we are compelled
to decide whether the future of South
Africa will be a growing Dutch suprem-

â¢The Premier concluded by dealing brietty
with the Government's future policy in
South Africa, declaring that, while there
must be ho doubt as to the paramountry
of the sovereign power of Great Britain,
there must also be no doubt that the
white races in South Africa would be put
upon an equality and due precautions
taken for the "philanthropic, friendly and
improving .treatment of those countless
indigenous races of whose destiny I fear
we have hitherto, been too forgetful.
"Those thinigs must be Insisted upon in
the future," exclaimed Lord Salisbury.
"By what means they are. to be obtained
I do not know. I hope they may be con
sistent with a -very large amount-** au
tonomy on the part of a race which values
its Individual share in government as
much as the Dutch people do. But with
that Question we are not concerned now.
We have only to make It clear that the
great objects essential to the power of
England In South Africa, to the good gov
ernment of South Africa and to the rights
of all the races concerned, are the objects
of the British Government; objects,
which, with the full support of the na
tion and without distinction of party the
Government are now pursuing and which
they will pursue and persevere in to the
end." (Cheers.) .
After several less important speeches,
the House of Lords agreed to the address
and adjourned.
INDIANS DEMAND. THAT
SOLDIERS BE PUNISHED
Promise That if This Is Done There
Will Be no Further
Trouble.
GLOBE, Ariz., Oct. 17.â Information re
garding the disturbance between negro
soldiers and Indians at the San Carlos
agency Indicates that the trouble Is far
from being ended.
The Indians demand the punishment of
the soldiers who participated in the as
sault, agreeing that If the culprits are
arrested and punishment meted out to
them the Incident will be closed, other
wise they will take the matter into their
own hands and they threaten to extermin
ate the soldiers. â  7 -â -
There are probably 1000 adult male In
dians at the agency, all armed, and the
consequences of an outbreak are viewed
with much apprehension. Thirteen sol
diers. implicated In the assault upon the
Indians, have been arrested, and will
probably be held for trial in the United
States court. An Indian policeman, who
was seriously. injured by the soldiers, is
not expected to live and his death might
greatly complicate matters. The agent
and the commanding officers are doing
their utmost to quell the disturbance and
bring the culprits to Justice.

cX /p ESTERDAY was Grand Encamp-
YESTERDAY was Grand Fellows'
m< -nt day at the Odd Fellows'
|f building, for that body met in an
il nual session in Memorial Hall.
y There were in attendance Grand
Patriarch J. W. Harris and all the grand
officers and a full representation from the
ninety-five subordinate encampments in
the Jurisdiction. After organization the
Grand Encampment degree was conferred
upon seventy past chief patriarchs. There
were provided for those entitled to them
250 metal badges of beautiful design, but
that number was not sufficient to meet the
demands by all entitled to them and ad
ditional ones were ordered.
Reports were received from. Grand Pa
triarch James W. Harris, Grand Scribe
William H. Barnes, Grand Treasurer
George W. Lemont, Grand Representa
tives J. T. Doran and O. W. Erie wine;
committee on appealsâ Arthur S. Ward,

ing. These give in detail the work of that
order during the year. -
The grand patriarch in his report says:
The year LS3JB and up to the middle of
March, IM>9, were serious oates in the
history of California. A dismal, dry
year closed, depressing every avenue
of life, and for almost three months of
the new year dark forebodings hovered
over the future; and, as a matter of
course, our term, ending December 31,
189 K. and ip to May. 1899, was anything
but encouraging and prosperous; but
as the report of the grand scribe
shows, despite these untoward sur
roundings, we made a net gain of
seven for 1898, and notwithstanding
the depression, suspensions, etc., of the
term ending June 30, 1899, the loss of .
said term is but the trifle of eighteen,
and since the beginning of the new
term, in July of this year, a renewed
and active Interest Is manifest in al
most every subordinate.
Especially gratifying is the status in
the city of San Franclsco, where every
encampment, without exception, has
been doing work, a state of affairs un
known here for years. in other sec
tions, as wiil be seen by the reports of
the deputies, marked energy is mani
fest, and It is not exaggerating to pre
dict a line increase for the present
term.
ring the year he officially visited
fhlrty-four encampments and paid a num
ber of fraternal visits unofficially, lie
pays a high compliment to Grand Scribe
Barnes and Grand Treasurer Lemont.
In the report of the committee on ap
peals there i.s a case which reverses the
decision of Santa Rosa Encampment,
whirl; refused to pay benefits to a mem
ber who had been admitted to the home
at Thermalito, on the ground that he is
a guest there. The committee adds that
the benefit- must be paid, not to the indi
vidual but to the trustees of the home.
This was approved.
Invitations were received from Fresno
and from Redding to hold the Grand En
campment of 1900 there. These will be
acted upon to-day.
During the day the grand body was
visited by Grand Patriarch Davis of the

The ladies who belong to the Rebekah
branch have not been idle in the matter
of the Jubilee. Hundreds of them have
been working to the end that so far as
they are concerned no one shall have lt
to say that they have not done their
share toward the success of the celebra
tion. Some of the lodges of this branch
have-been busy during the past week in
the preparation of special features to
display in the parade to-morrow, notably
Oriental Lodge No. 90. which is preparing
a float, but what It is to be the ladies
decline to tell as they say that they do
not want any other lodge to copy them.
The members. of Drill Corps No. 2 have
been drilling every evening to be so per
fect as to attract the attention of all on
lookers and to win their commendation.
They have another motive In perfecting
themselves, in the drill, and that is the
carrying away of the first prize that will
be awarded at j the competitive drill in
the Pavilion to-morrow night. . One of
the prizes ls a pair of Ivory gavels mount
ed with 14-karat gold and having handles
made of historic wood from the Philip
pine Islands. It must be said to the credit
of the members of - this - corps that since
the organization last May no member has
missed a drill, with the exception of one
who - hau the misfortune to sustain an
injury to one . of her feet, which â¢ forced
her to withdraw from .' the corps. '.

; a float in the parade. This committee has
i in the past three years expended in re

session of the Sovereign Grand Lodge it
'â¢ was announced that the San Francisco
relief committee leads all such commit

was the Emporium, which had placed a
fine display over the main entrance, and
it was to have been illuminated by elec

were being tested there was a leak and
the bunting caught fire, and In a very
short space of time the entire decoration
was a mass of ruins.
At 7 o'clock last night the electrical il
lumination at the Odd Fellows' building
was tested and the effect in red, white,
blue and gold was grand and effective.
The lights were allowed to burn but a
short time. The building will be illum

GRAND CHAPTER
EASTERN STAR
et., â jHE Grand Chapter of the Eastern
Star held its first session yesterday
afternoon in the Sherman-Clay
( 3 Hall. There were present all the
grand officers, whose names have
already been published in The Call, and
delegates from all the chapters of the
jurisdiction, which embraces California
and Nevada.
After the preliminary business of or
ganizing the grand body the time was
taken up In the reading of the annual re
ports of the worthy grand matron, Mrs.
Maria A. Pierce of Oakland, and of Dr.
Joseph Martin Laurance of Los Angeles,
the worthy grand patron.
The grand matron gave an account of
good result of the schools, of instruction
held in all parts of the jurisdiction during
the year. She recommends that the juris
diction be divided into ten districts, with
one grand instructor for each district,
and that the appointments be solely con
trolled by a standard of qualification;
that it shall be optional whether the
grand oflicers or a corps selected from
various chapters shall exemplify the work
for the Grand Chapter; that a commit
tee on ritualistic work shall be the au
thority on ritual; that the time for elect
ing officers for subordinate chapters be
changed so that such shall be held prior
to the meeting of the Grand Chapter, in
stead of so closely following it as at pres-
ent. ..-.-,'.'â  â  .
The grand patron in his report says
that during the year there were insti
tuted nine chapters. He recommends
the alteration of the burdens of new
chapters; he recommends several changes
In the private work of the order and that
August 31 of each year he set apart by
the General Grand Chapter of the United
States as "our Natal day," it being the
anniversary of the birth of Robert Mor
ris the father and founder of the Order
of the Eastern Star. He suggests that
there should be built and maintained an
Eastern Star Home for the wives,
mothers, daughters and sisters of Master
Masons, where they may find a refuge.
The officers for the ensuing term will be
elected to-morrow afternoon and that
night Ivy Chapter will exemplify the
work in Masonic Temple before the Grand
Chapter. 77' -'<â¢ " . ....
Last evening there was a very brilliant
assemblage of the members of the order
In the Sherman-Clay Hall, the occasion
being a reception tendered by the seven
local chapters to the grand officers. The
function was under the direction of the
following named, who constituted the
committee of arrangements: Mrs. Ada
R. Duncan (chairman), E. K. Head, Em
ma Ella Bradley, Dr. James M. Gassa
way, Mrs. Lydia A. Steele, Mrs. Frances
Bonnefield, â *. M. J. Savage, Mrs. Anna
Johnson, Mrs. Carter, Andrew Christen
sen, Mrs. James A. Wilson. Mrs. Hickey,
M. Rohlmann, Mrs. McDonald, Mrs.
Bonales, Dr. A. Miles Taylor, Mrs. Olive
Schmidt, Miss McConskey, A. M. Blade,
Mrs. A. M. Blade and Mrs. F. M. Wood.
Dr. Gassaway was master of ceremo
nies, and he called for the overture from
"Zampa" by the orchestra, then followed
a grand march led by Dr. Gassaway,
patron, and Mrs. Lydia A. Steele, matron
of Ivy Chapter. After that the worthy
grand matron, Mrs. Maria A. Pierce, and
the worthy grand patron. Dr. Lawrence,
received the delegates and shook hands
with each.
May Frances Code favored with a con
tralto solo, "To All Eternity," rendering
it in a most charming voice; Mrs. Celina
Ciprio recited "The Dandy Fifth," by
Frank H. Gassaway, and for an encore
gave the "Pride of Battery B," by the
same writer. The programme concluded
with vocal selections by the Knicker
bocker quartet. . Then followed a pro
gramme of dances, Ernest K. Head being
the floor director. The four hundred ladies
and gentlemen i who composed the party
did not depart until midnight. '
fresh flowers and fragrant plants, about
forty guests sat down last evening to
partake of the good cheer provided for
the first annual banquet of the California
Commandery of the Society of American
Wars, which was held in the conservatory
of the Palace Hotel.
In the effort to make their initial din
ner a success those having the arrange
ments in charge gave the chef carte
blanche impressing on him the necessity
of doing his best,, regardless of the dam
age. - The consequence was that a menu
was provided which carried the guests
ln an epicurean ecstacy far on Into the
evening.
When the cigars had been lighted and
the black-coffee cups had been filled for
the second time Toastmaster Com
mander Henry Glass, U. S. N., arose and
after making a few introductory remarks
called upon the following gentlemen, who
arose in the order named, and spoke on
the following subjects: Prayer, Rev.
Arthur Crosby; "The Society of American
Wars," David Starr Jordan; "The Navy,"
Captain Caspar Frederick Goodrich; "Cal
ifornia," Hon. George C. Perkins; "The
Army," Major C. L. Tilden; "Building a
Navy," Irving M. Scott. In all of these
speeches and in the Impromptu ones that
followed there was not a sentence ut
tered that was not pregnant with wisdom
and bright with wit.
The dinner was a complete success and
so much did those present enjoy it that
the sun was only a little behind them
In rising.
Previous to the banquet a meeting was
held in the hotel, at which the following
officers were elected to serve during the
ensuing year: Commander, Captain
Henry Glass, U. S. N. ; recorder, A. J.

Cruelty to a Child.
Neighbors of Mrs. Augusta Haskins,
whose husband has a clothing store at
440 Bush street, complained to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
that she was in the habit of taking her
stepdaughter Dora, aged 8 years, into the
yard and beating her unmercifully. She
was arrested yesterday afternoon by Offi
cers McMurray and Coleman and taken
to the City Prison, but was released on
$150 cash bail. The child was examined by
the matron at the prison, but beyond a
slight mark on her cheek and an injured
kneecap, nothing wrong was found. The
girl said her kneecap was Injured by a
fall. Several of the neighbors will be
asked to testify in Judge Mogan's court
to-day. : '

ANNUAL SESSION
OF FORESTERS
FRESNO, Oct. 17.â The tenth annual
session of the California High
Court, Independent Order of For
esters, convened at Spinney Hall
this afternoon. High Chief Ranger
G. A. McElfresh of Los Angeles presided,
and all the other officers were present.
Over 400 delegates were in attendance.
Most of the afternoon was spent in or
ganizing the High Court. The reports of
the various officers were approved, in
cluding an address by the high chief
ranger. Mr. McElfresh reviewed the
progress made by the order during the
year. In speaking of the prosperity of
the order Mr. McElfresh stated that its
membership consisted of 150,000 young and
vigorous men, whose average age is un
der 38 years. It has a surplus fund
amounting to over $3,500,000 and an aver
age death rate of less than six to the
thousand. He stated that the order had
distributed over $7,000,000 among the
widows and orphans of deceased breth
ren. The speaker ascribed the falling off
of business which followed the readjust
ment of the rates of assessment to lack
of Information upon the part of the gen
eral membership as to the Importance and
necessltly of the readjustment and the
keen competition of sister societies that
have not yet seen the importance of re
adjusting their rates, and which by rea
son of their few years of experience in
the . fraternal Insurance field have
not been forced to do so by
the natural laws governing In the
premises. He thought the falling
off of new business only a temporary con
dition, because the change was in har
mony with the opinions of all the lead
ing and intelligent minds in fraternal in
surance. The order, explained the
.speaker, had suffered no loss in member
ship by reason of the readjustment. Other
features of Forestry were also discussed
by the chief ranger, and his address was
frequently interrupted by applause.
To-night a grand banquet was given at
Armory Hall in honor of the visiting For
esters by members of the local court.
To-morrow the High Court will be in
session all day. In the evening the high
officer delegates will be given a recep
tion at the Barton Opera-house by the
citizens of Fresno. On the day following
a suburban railway excursion will take
place, and they will be banqueted at the
Maltermoro winery. The number of dele
gates In attendance is 423. 'â¢} : ; :

POSSE AND
DESPERADOES
IN BATTLE
One Bandit Killed and An

Had Murdered an American and
Raided Ranches in the Pata-
gonia Mountains.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NOG ALES, Ariz., Oct. 17.â Word was
received yesterday at the Sheriffs office
from Harshaw, this county, that a party
of. bandits camped In . the Patagonia
Mountains had for some days been rob
bing and plundering frtrms and ranches
in the vicinity. A traveler who had been
apprehended by the robbers â  came into
town and reported having seen fifty gal
lons of contraband mescal in the moun
tains near the camp of the bandits. A re
port was received 'yesterday that" an
American had been shot by the robbers.
The Sheriff organized a posse and left
last night, calculating to arrive at Har
shaw about daylight. This forenoon a
telegram from Flewelling brought the
news of a light ween the posse and
the bandits at daylight this morning One
of the bandits was killed and another
wounded. None of tlie posse was in
,inr< d.
The robbers took flight toward the in
ternational boundary line.
In response to a telegram another posse
was organized and left at noon to-day,
with the hope of Intercepting the robbers.
The horses of the' Flewelling posse grave
out and the men were consequently un
able to follow the trail. A posse will also
go out from Nogales, Sonora, to take the
trail if the robbers succeed in escaping
across the line.
CORPORATIONS FIGHT
FOR WATER RIGHTS
Case Involving the Water Rights of
Kern River Opened at
Bakersfield.
UCERSFIELD, Oct. 17.â The Kern
County Land Company and Miller & Lux
are In n great battle over the water sup
ply of Kern River. The fight began this
morning when the case of the Farmers'
Canal Company vs. J. R. Simmons et
al. went to trial. The land company's
force are behind the canal company and
the Miller & Lux people behind Simmons
et' al. The case involves the rights of
Panama Slough, which is the same as
the Farmers' Canal. E. J. Mc< 'uti
of -San Francisco and r.aul Bennett of
the local bar represent the land company
and Houghton & Houghton and Joseph
Campbell are for Miller & Lux. Judge
Lucien Shaw of Los Angeles is hearing
the case. It is estimated that the trial
will occupy the attention of the court
continuously for two months. An army
of witnesses has been summoned.
The Fanners' Canal Company organiz- i
ed in the early seventies and in conse- j
quence all the old-timers living that know ;
anything about the canal are gathered i
to testify. ' The water interests of the I
big concerns are so closely and critically
connected that it is predicted that the I
fight will involve the whole water rights
OI Kern River before it Is concluded, a j
repetition of the great contest of 1881, i
when the county was * shaken with a )
fervor of excitement by the two factions.
This time the people are looking on with
complacency, as they have nothing to
lose either way. Kern River is now !
owned, bottom and bank, by the two;
corporations, and if one. of them should)
own it no change would be felt from the
present condition. |

ANTI-EXPANSION CRUSADE
IS LAUNCHED AT CHICAGO
CHICAGO, Oct. 17â The opposition of
the anti-expansionists to the subjugation '
of the Filipinos took tangible form to
day in the meeting of about 160 delegates ,
from different parts of the country to
launch a crusade against the policy of the (
administration In the Philippines. The
meeting was called to order in Central
Music Hall by Temporary Chairman Ed- ,
win Burritt Smith of Chicago. Mr. Smith
spoke as follows:
It Is now some eighteen months since Mr. <
McKinley, with professions of reluctance, de
liberately, changed a simple naval position be
fore Manila Into a complex military situation <
on Asiatic soil. The army of occupation was
not sent to protect the naval force under Ad
miral Dewey. It was sent to support a dec- ,
laration that the Filipinos as well as the
Cubans are and of right ought to lie free and
j Independent, it was sent to defend a flag hoist
ed without right on a foreign soil. It was
sent to transform a war of libera
tion in th? Western Hemisphere Into a ,
war of conquest In Asia -in a word, to com
mence "a war of criminal aggression." -Men
recruited to tight for liberty in Cuba were sent
Ito fight against liberty, In the Philippines. Mr. I
I McKinley thus transformed a war of humanity [
in Cuba into a war Of inhumanity in the Kast. '
The administration seeks to complete the de- ;
Ptruction of self-government in the Philippines '
before the American people can pass Judgment '
upon Its course. It seems to be thought that *
i with the death by American hands of the first !
attempt at self-government In Asia all oppo- ?
sition here v.ill cease. J
This ls a huge mistake. Much as we abhor :
' the "war of crimlnr' aggression" in the Phil- 'â  ;
ippines, greatly as we regret that the blood of r
i the Filipinos is on American hands, we more
deeply resent the betraj of American insti- (
tutions at home. The real firing line is not in
the suburbs of Manila. It Is here. The enemy
ls of our own household. Me comes to us ! ,
prating or* "loyalty" and uttering fine phrases ,
â¢j about benevolent assimilation, priceless prin- \
lj clple and hoisted Bags j Â°
This conference should make It known at l
j once to whom It may concern that we propose I
â¢next year to contribute to the defeat of any \.
party tim shall then stand for the forcible \
j subjugation of any people; that we shall op- ,
; pose the re-election of any, who. In the White
House or Congress, shall have betrayed Ameri- '
: can liberty in pursuit of empire. 'â  r
The committee on organization of the
j conference was appointed as follows- p
i George G. Mercer, Philadelphia; Frank ll' ; p
j Scott, Chicago; Dana Estes, Boston- o
I Loafs R. Ehrich. Colorado Springs Colo' '
i and Paul . F. Coste, St. Louis. * "' r
j Owing to the Illness of his wife George l!
; H. Boutwell could not be present, but l
i a letter from him read as follows: - '
I There are several points on which the con-' t
; ferrnce may declare its opinions and announce ! I

Addresses.
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 17.â The train bearing
the Presidential party from the North
slipped into Chicago at 2:40 o'clock this
afternoon, was transferred to the Michi
gan Central tracks and left for Michigan
points almost immediately. As the train
passed through Lake Forest the golf links
were deserted and the players surrounded
the station, cheering lustily, A short stop
was made and President McKinley bowed
to the throng, but there was no speech
making.
When the train arrived at the North
western station here a guard of policemen
was stationed alongside the cars. There
was not a large gathering of people, as
few knew that tne President was to ar
rive. Most of the people who crowded
around the rear car containing the Presi
dent were passengers awaiting trains.
President McKinley did not appear and
no speeches were made. A few friends
entered the President's car and greeted i
him. *.'-< -.-.77- .-â¢ ; â  ,-
This evening the President delivered

Despite the rain and the early hour a
very large crowd assembled in the opera

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1899.
3. The conference may declare its Intention
to oppose the re-election of any member of
Congress who may sustain an appropriation of
men or money for the prosecution of the war.
On these points there should be no compromise,
no concessions.
At present we are not in co-operation with
any political party. . Let us reserve arid pre
serve our right of action and bur freedom of
action in the Presidential election of 1900. until
that contest has been organized, coupled with
the understanding that lt is our purpose to con
tribute to the defeat of any party that de
mands the subjugation of the Philippines.
Professor Albert 11. Tolman of the
Chicago University said:
Just one Important official message was' sent
o the Filipinos by this Government previous to
the outbreak of hostilities a; Manila. This
iv. is the proclamation of President McKinley,
la ted December 21, 1898, and made public in
:hls country on January 5, 1899.
There is one adjective that will describe
:his document fully and fairly. It is a
Spanish proclamationâ such a one as the
Filipinos had many times listened to. There
s the same parade or benevolent purposes and
he same tyrannical substance. The natives
-ecognlzed the document as one. of the kind
o which they were accustomed.
Not only are the most un-American things
â  resent lit this proclamation, but the most im
Â«ortant things that have been stated are here
emitted. It has been well said that this docu
ment takes not the slightest notice of any
-lghts on the ) part of the people of these
slands except what we are graciously pleased
o grant them; lt contains no recognition of
:helr long struggle against Spain, their ardu
ous struggle for liberty, no recognition of
'.heir long sufferings under her rule, no ae
isr-cwledgment of their fitness for self-govern
ment, no expression of our desire or even of
â¢ur willingness that they should govern them-
elves. Mr. McKinley Simply promised the
Filipinos protection "in their personal and re

WANTS CHURCH TO

Address of Bishop More
land at Sacramento.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Oct 17.-The twenty
first annual convocation of the Pro
testant Episcopal church of Northern
California opened at St. Paul's Church
in this city this morning. Bishop Wil
liam Hall Moreland officiated at holy
communion and afterward delivered an
address in which he reviewed the work
of the Episcopal church in his newly
formed diocese during the past year and
spoke of the plans for the future.
The Bishop refused the tender of tha
clergy and laity, made at the conference
held In this city a year ago, offering to
raise the sum of $1000 to aid the Bishop
in establishing himself here. The Bishop
stated his belief that the district was
not In a position to warrant such effort
in the course of his address the Bishop
said that his people must be taught that
"there is no more charity in paying pew
rents or monthly pledges than in pay
ing house rent or taxes or gas or gro
cery bills." Bishop Moreland submitted
for the i consideration of the conference a
pian by which the diocese might be
come Independent and self-supporting
by the year 1904, the Bishop remarking
"For twenty-live years Northern Cali
fornia has been a dependence upon the
bounty of the church. Within. that time
this district received from the board of
missions the sum of $82,500 for the /up
port of the Episcopal churches alone
and $37,500 additional for the building
up of its missionary work. '
"Self-respect compels us to consider how
soon we may bring this condition to an
end. Loyalty to the church demands that
we lay our plans to release the board as
soon as possible from this large expense.
Love- of our brethren constrains us to
take action in order that the loving, nur
turing care of our great church, so long
given to us, may be transferred to weaker
and less favored fields."
The remainder of_the session to-day was
consumed ln the consideration of routine
matters. â¢â¢j-.'-Â«v- "-' w
To-night a reception was tendered to
Bishop and Mrs. Moreland in the parlors
of the Golden Eagle Hotel, and it proved
a very attractive social event, several

wives and daughters calling to pay their

Reception to Funston.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct.. 17.â
General FunÃton will -be tendered a re
ception next ' Friday evening : at Stanford
University by the resident members of
sonal declaration of war many brave American j
soldiers and brave Filipino patriots have died
and are dying. And . when shall we. see the I
end of William McKinley's war?
Hon. Whitelaw Reld, Senator Davis and Sen
ator Frye, three of the five commissioners who
made the treaty with Spain, have defended it
heartily on the ground of pecuniary and com
mercial advantages likely to result to the
United States from our possession of the Phil
ippines. The welfare of the Filipinos has not
occupied a prominent place In their thoughts.
Not destiny and duty, but dollars, put us into
the Philippines. And who will get the dollars?
Millionaires and syndicates will secure any
small gains which could just as easily be ob
tained without enforcing our sovereignty. Mil
lionaires and syndicates are virtually saying to
our common soldiers: â -. - â¢
"You stop the bullets and we'll do the rest."
The proclamation issued at the beginning of
April by the American Commissioners to the
Philippines declared that hostilities had broken I
out because of the "pure alms and purposes of
the American Government and people" had
been "misinterpreted." if this means that the
Filipinos misunderstood the President's pre
vious public letter. I deny it. They understood
It; that was the trouble, and I challenge any
body to understand it differently.
J. Sterling Morton presided at the even
ing session and upon introducing Carl
Schurz, who delivered the address of the
evening, spoke as follows:
After 1500 years of Christianity, intellectual
growth and of a constantly improving civiliza
tion, in which the tender kindness and loving
teachings of the gentle Nazarene have been
thrown like light Into the uttermost parts of
the earth, we witness the most phenomenal
paradox In government which the race baa ever
experienced. The Government of Russia, a
government with the largest standing army in
the world,- declares for disarmament and 'pro
poses universal peace. But the great republic
of the United States, founded by Washington,
Franklin, Jefferson and their compatriots, de
clares for war, conquest, subjugation and an
nexation. Russia would be the peacemaker,
the United States the warmaker. In ail history
there is not another so striking and inexplic
able antithesis.
Mr. Schurz, In his speech, said:
I confidently trust that the American people
will prove themselves too clear-headed not to
appreciate the vital difference between the ex
pansion of the republic and Its free institu
tions over contiguous territory and kindred
populations, which we all gladly welcome if
accomplished peaceably and honorablyâ and
imperialism which reaches out for distant
lands to be ruled as subject provinces; too In
telligent not to perceive that our very first
step on the road of imperialism has been a be
trayal of the fundamental principles of de
mocracy followed by disaster and disgrace;
too enlightened not to understand that a mon
archy may do such things and still remain a
strong monarchy, while a democracy cannot
do them and still remain a democracy; too
wise not to detect the false pride or the
dangerous ambitions or the . selfish schemes
which so often hid* themselves under that de
ceptive cry of mock patriotism: "Our country,
right or wrong." They will not fail to recog
nize that our dignity, our free Institutions and
the peace and welfare of this and coming
generations of Americans will be secure only
as we Cling to the watchword of true patriot
ism: "Our countryâ right to be kept
right; when wrong to be put right." *.Â«*. r;

Boom for Copperopolis.
COPPEROPOLIS, Oct. 17.-After a close
down of six years and two months, the
Union Copper Company started to pump
out the old Cnion copper shaft at 2
o'clock yesterday. The pumping of the
mine will probably require three months'
time. Last night the old residents of the
place fired cannons and giant, powder,
whistles were blown, the large bells at
the schoolhouse and church were rung
and a general jollification was held. The
opening of this property will give employ
ment to a great number of people and
means that Copperopolis will once again
be one of the foremost towns in the
county. .â¢iv*.

It will be necessary to recapture San

tablish a base of supplies. The Rio Grande
is being used as the supply line from
Calumpit, but the river is falling rapidly
and It is doubtful unless the rain comes
whether all the supplies can be forwarded
by water. Regrets are expressed at the
front that this movement was not made
during the heavy rainfall. At present
wagon and horse and mule transportation
is able to fulfill only a small portion of
the requisitions. The dropping of bOO
mules on the steamer Slam is a serious
loss now. ' - __Â

GENERAL CRITICISM
OF OTIS' METHODS
MANILA, Oct. 13 (via Hongkong, Oct.
; 17).â Recent military operations on Porac
! to the north and on San Francisco and
â  Malabon to the south, which were
planned in General Otis' office In Manila,
â â  contemplated only expeditions against the
' enemy and immediate withdrawal from
I these regions. These operations were
severely criticised by the military men
! generally, as the territory abandoned by
| the Americans was immediately reoccu
! pled by the insurgents. â¢
The futility of such maneuvers is dis-
I couraging. Soldiers and officers alike
| feel that their lives are being sacrificed
: without accomplishing results. Our losses
are heavy when compared with the ad
l vantages gained. Sound military men
say the territory must be held by garri
! soning the principal ports and interior
towns. .
! The blockaded ports are filled with im
mense quantities of hemp. Foreign buy
ers and shippers claim that the market
and the people are being ruined, and
peaceful people starved through the short
age in rice caused by the failure of the
Americans to occupy and control these
ports.
The medical department is outraged be
cause General Otis refuses to recognize
through its representations the dire need
of more medical officers, nurses and hos-
I pital room.
The first reserve hospital is in bad
! shape. Hundreds of sick are lying in dirty
I tents, though for months the extreme
| need of more room was impressed on the
' Governor General. The failure to erect
! or provide sufficient hospital room Is pos
â  sibly explained by General Otis' mental
i attitude, which causes him to say to
newspaper correspondents that 25 per cent
| of the men in the hospitals are maling
ering.
General Otis recently sent a line officer
i with no medical knowledge to Investigate
and report on the men sick in a certain
regiment, though the surgeons' official re
ports in hand showed an expert diagnosis
In each case.
Constant refusals to meet the quarter
masters' demands- may handicap future
moves very seriously. Many officers are
protecting themselves by going on record.

PARDON GRANTED
TO EMILE ARTON
The Notorious Panama
Canal Swindler Free. â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 17.â The Exchange Tele
graph Company publishes a dispatch from
Paris saying that Emile Arton of Panama
canal notoriety, has been pardoned.
EMILE ARTON.
It seems only yesterday that all Europe
was first ringing the name of Arton. He
was the "missing link" of the chain of j
Panama rascality. He was the inter- j
mediary between Baron de Reinach and j
the incriminated Deputies; that is, be- |
tween the briber and bribed. He wrote
the checks. He had the checkbook on j
whose stubs was recorded damnation for i
a hundred and forty, more or less, emi
nent politicians. He alone possessed the
secrets of the whole foul business; he
alone, at any rate, after Reinach put
himself out of the way. He is described
by those who knew him as having been i
Just the man for the Panama business.
He had all the tact and cunning for j
success in his mission of bribery and cor- j
ruption. He was in the prime of life, |
active and energetic, with not an "atom I
of scruple.- Of gentlemanly and engaging !
manners, he spoke several languages,
which enabled him to move about in dif- j
ferent countries without suspicion. At |
one time or another he appeared in all |
the capitals of Europe. As assistant to |
Reinach he was invaluable, and the way j
in which he got into relations with mem- I
bers of both Chambers and "persuaded"
some of them to vote for the Panama lot
tery loan was most skillful. Armed with
his checkbook, he frequented the Palais
Bourbon, and got informed of everything
that was going on, whether before or be
hind the scenes. He knew everybody,
and everybody knew him, and he
scattered his bribes in all di
rections and without limit. He
also lived without limit to his luxuries.
He had a splendid mansion in Paris in
the Rue Rouget de l'lsle, and a villa at
Bougival, both of which were popular
resorts for members of the gay world.
A beautiful Austrian actress, once a
celebrity on the stage, was his most con
stant companion, though she was by
no means alone in enjoying his "protec
tion." He was the "boss" of the stock
exchange, and the backer and manager
of several theaters.
The crash came in 1892. On July 13 in \
that year a warrant for his arrest was j
issued. But when they sought to sc.-ve
it he was gone. He had been associated'
with a certain M. Gilbert Le Quay as j
director of the Societe Francaise de Dy- i
namite. M. Le Guay, who appears to j
have been an honest man, but of weak
character, 'allowed himself to fall under
the Influence of Arton to such an extent i
that the latter was enabled to appropri- \
ate to his own use as much as $740,000 of
the company's funds. Arton fled Just in
time to avoid arrest when the authorities
made a descent upon his lodgings in the |
Rue Rouget de l'lsle. But the unfortun
ate M. Le Guay, who is said to have been
. his dupe, was tried and . condemned, on
February 15, 1 93, to five years' imprison- j
ment and a fine of $600. Meanwhile the |
agents of the French police were, to all !
appearances, doing their best to track !
the fugitive, but in vain. Then came the
Panama scandal. Arton was, in his ab- I
sence, tried for his attempt to bribe a
Deputy, convicted and sentenced to five
years' imprisonment and $80,000 fine. He
was also sentenced to twenty years' im
prisonment and $600 fine for his rascality
in connection with the dynamite company.
When Arton fled from Paris he went
straight to London, and there he lived
openly while French detectives searched
the world over for him. Three years
elapsed before he was discovered. His ar
rest was effected by English and French
detectives.
MAYO BAND JOINS
THE YAQUI REBELS
Will Make Common
Cause Against Mexico.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 17.â A dispatch
from Ortiz, State of Sonora, Mexico, says
that a band of over 300 Mayo Indians have
joined the Yaqui rebels at their rendez
vous near Sahauripa. When the Taqui
uprising occurred a few months ago emis
saries were sent by the Yaqui chiefs to
the Mayo tribe to induce those Indians to
Join them in the war against the Mexican
Government.
The Mayo chiefs refused to take part
in the war, but the enthusiasm of^ the
younger braves could not be controlled
and many of them abandoned their pas
i toral pursuits and began dancing. These
I dances have continued without interrup
| tion ever since, and it is expected several
! hundred more Mayos in addition to the
! hundreds now at the Sahauripa camp will
soon join the Yaquis.
The Mayos and Yaquis have long oc
cupied adjacent territory and lived in har
mony with each other.
In the previous wars of the Yaquis
against the Mexican Government the
I Mayos refused to become their allies and
j the present action of the younger Mayo
braves is strongly disapproved: by the
older element of the peaceable tribe.
The Mayo tribe of Indians should not
1 be confounded with the Mayo Indians,
! the latter tribe being now at war with the
j Mexican Government in the State of Yu
catan, near ttie border of British Hon
| duras.
Llutenant Lacanne of the Mexican army
| passed through here to-day on his way
to New Orleans, where he will take
charge of the gunboat Montezuma, which
was recently purchased by the Mexican
Government. He will equip the boat with
â¢a crew of Americans and proceed with it
immediately to the Island of Cozumet, on
I the coast of Yucatan, where lt will join
the Mexican mosquito fleet in the cam
i paign now being waged against the re
j bellious Mayo Indians. Lieutenant La
| canne states the land forces nave already
I attacked the Indians. The Indians: are
! well armed and have been working for
several months building strong intrench-
I ments and defenses. It is reported that
\ they are receiving substantial aid from
| residents of British Honduras, and that
I some of their fortifications are manned
j with rapid-fire guns which were obtained
! by the rebels from that source.

CHIPMAN ON COMMISSION
Practical Knowledge of Traffic
Conditions Necessary,
Southern Pacific Attorney Gets No Comfort
From Merchants, Who Tell What
Sort of Man Is Required,
1
Câ jp^llK afternoon organetto of the
Southern Pacific Company is "up
against it" in the matter of its
l}, absurd claim that opposition to the
appointment of a Southern Pacific
attorney to the vacancy on the Interstate
Commerce Commission is opposition to
California. Such an Idea may have been
received from the yellow "knockery"
without cracking a smile in the editorial
ciih where the writers fatten on South
ern Paeilie money. The hard fad dem
onstrated by interviews with the leading
merchants of California is that they will
not be enthusiastic if the President should
name for the position of Commissioner a
railroad lawyer. General Chipman is
not their choice. They want a business
man. a person of affairs and experience
in transportation matters; one ho
knows tho difference between a "differen
tial" and us application and a brake
beam. In a word, they want some one
who knows what they need, and what are
ihe business needs of the Pa. ifie Coast.
-A railroad attorney or a hack politician
does not fill the measure of their desires.
I If there is a merchant In the wholesale
district bounded by Mission, Clay, East
and Sansome streets v. in. is enthusiastic
in the advocacy of the appointment of
General Chipman for Interstate Com
merce Commissioner, .<. diligent search
failed to , reveal his occult hiding place.
On the other hand, there were scores of
merchants who had clean-cut ideas as to
what is necessary. It is unnecessary to
repeat the unpleasant things that were
said about the foolish attempt of the
Southern Pacific Company to foist its at
torney on the President of the I'nited
States as a Commissioner. Une typical
statement was this: "If the President
should appoint a railroad attorney to rep
resent the i'acilie < 'oast in the Interstate
Commission it would be enough against
h!m to hurt th.- chances of publican
success in California at the coming Presi
dential election. This is something that
President McKinley will be likely to heed
when he knows the facts."
The largest organization of merchants
west of the Mississippi is the Pacific
Coast Traffic Association; soon to be aug
mented by accessions of membership
from the States of Washington and Ore
gon, It is this association which, as a
whole; is making the movement to have a
Commissioner appointed who shall rep
resent truly the rests of the whole
const. Already 400 hob sale houses are
enrolled In its membership, the com- '
bined capital of which runs high in the j
ten of millions of dollars, and represents j
all the leading commercial enterprises of
the coast from Pugel Sound to San Diego.
The association is engaged in a light for |
the Jobbing business of th. coast, -ral ]
defendants in a suit now- pending before
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The members an not politicians, but busi
ness men. whose success or failure means
much to the welfare of the coast.
Seeing that the St. Louis and Chicago
jobbers had united to cinch the coast ;
knowing that the coast had no represen
tative on tiie commission and that it has
never had one: finding that there was a
chance to get a real representative of
Pacitic Coast interests on the commission, :
one of the first matters to engage the rep
resentatives of the association in San
Francisco was the necessity of doing all
that was possible to have some man
named who could benefit the coast. These
gentlemen are disgusted to find that the
Southern Pacific Company; with its
usual greed. is trying to turn their op-!
portunity to its own selfish ends.
It is true that few merchants care to
openly antagonize the railroad people.
Their business can be badly affected by
the hostile acts '!' the company. Tic
do not care to mention the name of Gen
eral Chipman to condemn 'the railroad
company: but hat they do not think
that a corporation attorney and a poli
tician will (ill the measure of their wants
appears clearly from what they say. In
indicating heir preferences hey show
whet they think would not be a good
selection. The Traffic Association has
not yet expressed its desire for the selec
tion of any particular candidate for the j
position af commissioner, and ma not
do so. There are three States In tin
league for the defense of the business of
the Pacilic Coast. They may have some

GOOD DOCTORS.
Are Quick to See and Appreciate Real
Merit in Any Preparation â Many
of Them Are Now Purchasing
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets in All Stomach
Troubles.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a dis-
covery of great value to the medical pro-
fession and the public. They are an un-
failing specific In all cases of dyspepsia
and disordered digestion.
Almost everybody's digestion is disord-
ered more or less, and the commonest
thing they do for it is to take some one
of the many so-called blood purifiers,
which ln many cases are merely strong
cathartics. Such things are not needed.
If the organs are in a clogged condition,
they need only a little help and they will
riglit themselves. Cathartics irritate the
Fcnsitive linings of the stomach and
bowels and often do more harm than
good.
Purging Is, not what Is needed. The
thing to do is to put the food in condi-
tion to be readily digested and assimilat-
ed. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do this
perfectly. They partly digest what Is
eaten and give the stomach just the help
it needs. They stimulate the secretion
and excretion of the digestive fluids and
relieve the congested condition of the
glands and membranes. They put the
who] digestive system in condition to
do its work. When that is done, you
need take no more tablets, unless you
cat what does not agree with yon. Then
lake one, or tw6 tabletsâ give them need-
ed help, and you will have no trouble.
It's a common sense medicine and a
common sense treatment and it will cure
every time. Not only cure the disease,
but cure th.c cause. Goes about It In a
perfectly sensible ,nd scientific way.
We have testimonials enough to fill a
book, but we don't publish many of them
Howeverâ
Mrs. E M. Faith of Byrds Creek. Wis
says: I have taken all the Tablets I got
of you and they have done their work
w.ll in my caÂ«>, for I feel like a different
person altogether. I don't doubt If 1 had
not got them i should have been at rest
by this time.
H. K. Willard, Onslow. la says: Mr

I choice to express. It is more than pos
sible that this matter will come op lor
discussion next week at the meeting to
be held In this city to effect a permanent
organization. In the meantime it is in
| teresting fo know that there is a candi
j date In Oregon to fill the vacancy in the
commission. This is ex-Governor Lord,
j who is boomed by Senator Simon.
! Charles Holbrook. of Holbrook, Merrill
l& Stetson, presided at the meeting- at
| which the Pacific Coast Traffic Associa
â  tion was called into existence in this city.
I Mr. Holbrook said yesterday concerning
I the needs of the coast in the matter of
1 commissioner:
"It Is almost a necessity that the Pacific
I Coast should have a representative on
i the Interstate Commerce Commission. He
j should have an intimate knowledge of
i the business of the coast, in order to be
! able to represent us intelligently. We are
; politically entitled to one member of the
i commission. The appointment is not
local. It is to represent the whole coast
A man of large business experience Is
needed and one who knows all about our
relations with the transportation lines In
a commercial way. He should not be se
lected as a successful politician. A lawyer
or politician will not be able to represent
j commercial interests involved in decisions
]of the commission. The Commissioners
; formulate rules. They should understand
the general principles underlying traffic
- ahd the relations of sea and rail, and of
! one section with another. I would not
like to see a man named for the position
i who is under obligations to any railroad.
i 1 prefer a man who is Independent. He
; should have, i repeat, large experience In I
! transportation and commercial affairs, It
! would 1..- better to have the choice go to
i Oregon or Washington than have him the
representative of any one railroad."
William Haas of Haas Bros., president '
of the Associated Wholesale Grocers of
California, said: "To represent the Pacific
'oast a Commissioner should be familiar
with the advantages of our geographical
position. Now that our Oriental trade is
Increasing, a well-equipped Commissioner
representing the coast can do much to
[ promote trade. He should be fully awake
to the requirements of traffic of this
coast. He should be thoroughly familiar
with transportation questions. No man
without that knowledge could meet tha :
other members of the commission on
equal terms. A novice in traffic matters
would have It all to learn. There are
many men in San Franclsco who have
! reconnected with business houses who
have the requisite knowledge. I think
that 11. D. Loveland, chairman of the
executve committee of the Traffic Asso
ciation, would be a good man for the
place â¢> tip-top man. Emphatically I
would say that a lawyer or politician is
not thâ¬. proper sort of man for the place."
Ernest Folger of J. A. Folger & Co.
said: "If we have a Pacific Coast repre
sentative in the Interstate Commerce
Commission he should be a business man.
No man would be the proper choice who
is not familiar with business conditions
and th.- making of rates. I would not
favor the appointment of a lawyer or pol
itician by any means, nor the appoint
ment of the representative of any rail
road. He should be a non-partisan traffic
man. thoroughly acquainted with the
needs 'â : the coast."
Frank S. Johnson of the Johnson-
Locke Commercial Company said- "H
D. Loveland is the man. He Is brilliant!
brainy and. above all things, practical.
He has complete knowledge of the ex
isting conditions on the coast. The coast
needs for Its representative a practical
ami Intelligent merchant, who must at
th.- same time be familiar with the law.
I will bet that If a canvass should be
made In he mercantile community Love
land would have a large vote as the
choice of San Francis.... and Chipman
would not be able to get a corporal's
guard of merchants to support him."
Philip Teller of Norton, Teller & Roden
said: "A Pacific Coast representative
member of the Interstate Commerce
Commission should be a combination of
traffic man and business man. That is
the requisite."
Sidney Smith of the California Fruit
Canners' Association said: "The Pacific
Coast member of the commission ought
not to 1..- a lawyer- nor a politician. What
we need to represent us is a man fa
miliar with all phases of transportation."
Isaac I'pham expressed this view: "It
will require a business man. No novice
in transportation and tariffs will be
able to represent the needs of the coast.
We do not want a lawyer. That Is my
Imoression."
W. R. Wheeler: "The first thing to do
Ip to get the President committed to giv
ing the Pacific Coast a place upon the
commission. I believe that the man
needed to fill the place properly must
be acquainted with the principles under
lying transportation. That would be the
best kind of a Commissioner."
- Charles M. Yates: "We need an indi
vidual of the type of J. S. Leeds. The
matter is purely one of business, con
sequently the best appointment would be
a business man. He should also have a
thorough knowledge of traffic matters."
Lippmann Sachs of the firm of Sachs
Bros. & Co.â "We deserve representation
ci the Interstate Commerce Commission.
San Francisco is the third In Importance
ofÂ»the shipping points of the United
States. We must not have a lawyer or
a politician to represent us. The first
would go too much Into the technicalities
of the situation and not display enough
practical judgment to be of any benefit
to us. Th.- other would have too many
strings on him to act fairly between tho
Jobbers and the transportation compan
ies. II" should be a man who is In posi
tion to assist in promoting commerce and
who will not be likely, by reason of , his
affiliations, to be biased in favor of 'the
transportation companies. This is not. a
local matter exactlyâ lt ls a question
that effects the whole country. Our pros
perity depends upon the promotion of
trade of the commerce between States,
In other words. It would be better for
us to have no representation whatever
on the commission than to have the
wrong man appointed. A lawyer will not
do, because he cannot look at the prac
tical effect of the measures that may
come before the commission. And a poli
tician would be out of place, because com
merce ls a matter so entirely foreign to
his profession and has no bearing what
ever upon the politics of any section or
State. The man who Is appointed must
be thoroughly, familiar with our condi
tions and the situation of our trade. He
positively must not be affiliated with any
transcontinental railroad, either directly
or by reputation, and at all times must
be in a position to act intelligently and
fairly. I do not care to speak directly
against General Chipman. but from what
I have said In a general wav you can
readily see from my point of view that
he would not fill the bill."
Alfred Meyerstein of the Meyer'steln
Companyâ "Better have no representative
whatever on the Interstate Commission
than to have the wrong man. All of the
wholesalers with whom I have discussed
the matter agree that a man of affairsâ
a man with a know!. -dire of trade mat
tersâshould represent us. Above all, he
should not be Identified with any trans
continental railroad. I do not think that
a politician or a lawyer should be ap
pointed. Either, I believe, would be detri
mental to our commercial interests. "â â

CELEBRATING MUSTER OUT
â¦
A BECALMED SCHOONER UNDER
FIRE AND HIT FOUR TIMES.
â¦ . â .
Captain Joseph D. Leitch Has Been
Made an Aid to General
'Shafterâ A Sword for
L y Wholly.
There came a sequel yesterday to the
jollification of the Montana men during
their last night of service. Monday even
ing the Montana camp was a lively scene.
The Kansas men had come up to have
a social with the Montana men, and part
of the entertainment, furnished the guests
was the firing of rifles. The regiment had
turned in all arms, but the Mausers and
Remingtons captured from the Spaniards
and Filipinos belonged to the men, and
they had plenty of ammunition. The
firing continued for over an hour, and
then most of the shooters turned their
attention to other forms of amusement.
Yesterday morning the master of the
schooner Ida A appeared at headquarters
and announced that while becalmed off
the Presidio his boat was hit. four times
by the bullets from the enthusiastic Mon
tanans and that for some time he and his
crew were in great danger of being shot.
The bullets were hitting the water all
around the: . and as there was no wind
they could not get out of range. They
were perhaps two miles from the camp
on the hill where the men were shooting,
and it was no use for them to call out.
All they could do was to trust to luck
that they would drift out of range or
that the firing would cease before any
of them were hit. As it was, three shots
struck the vessel and one went through
her sail.
An Investigation was Immediately
ordered, but it had little result. The Mon
tana men were mustered out yesterday
and there was no time to make a thor
ough investigation of the affair, besides
no one would admit that he fired any
shots, or that he saw any one else do so,
or even that any shots had been fired
from the Montana camp. It was pointed
out that the men of the Montana regi
ment had turned in all their arms and
therefore had nothing to shoot with, but
it was not with Government arms they
expressed their enthusiasm. it was fur
ther declared that most of the shooting
came from the Kansas camp, but it is not
probable that more than half a dozen of
the shots were tired from there. At any
rate, the investigation has developed
nothing.
Later in the day another complaint
came in from Harbor View. One of the
bullets had gone through a bedroom, and
the occupant wanted to be sure there
would be no repetition. Bullets were also
heard to whistle over the Presidio build
ings, but at the time it was not supposed
that any one was shooting ball cartridges.
Those who heard the men thought tney
were shooting blanks, and while it was
believed to be a little off color even with
blanks, from a military standpoint, still
none of the volunteer officers saw fit to
stop it. There is no guard from the post
garrison over the volunteer camps, so no
report of the shooting was turned in to
headquarters. '
Colonel Freeman, commandant of the
post, Issued an order yesterday forbidding
the discharge of firearms in any of the
camps. It has been a practice of the reg
iments to be mustered out to celebrate
their last night in service with some such
demonstration, but heretofore blank
cartridges have been used. Now the
practice will have to stop altogether.
Captain J. D. Leitch was relieved from
duty as an adjutant of the Presidio yes
terday and he was ordered to duty as an
aid to General Shafter. He has received
no orders from Washington assigning him
to the position, but it is not Improbable !
that he will he ordered away from this I
department. His place as post adjutant
has been taken by Captain James 11. Fri
er. Seventeenth Infantry.
Monday evening the officers of the Pre
sidio and those of the Twenty-eighth
Regiment called upon General Shafter to
pay their respects and to congrati 'ate
him upon his retention In the vo' \,.'teer
service and as commander of this depart
ment. The band of the Twenty-eighth
Regiment was with the officers and It ser
enaded the general. There were nearly
seventy officers in attendance.
# Three hundred recruits under command
of Captain W. N. Hughes, Thirteenth In
fantry, and Lieutenants W. N. Hughes
Wilson. Pasco.' and Kinzie have been as
signed to the transport Manuense with
two companies of the Thirty-first 'under
command of Lieutenant Colonel Hayes
The Montana regiment was mustered
out yesterday, each man receiving in the
neighborhood of $100 in pay and allow
ances. The regiment will start east on a
special train this evening, the train to
leave from the 9 o'clock boat from this
side. The bulk of the regiment will go
over on the 8 o'clock boat, and the 9
o'clock will be the last that will catch :+>.
train. --....â 
The men of the Washington regiment
presented Colonel Wholly with a beautiful
sword yesterday. It was the finest the
men could buy, and every man in the regi
ment contributed his share to the pur
chase price. On the blade is the colonel's
name and the fact that it was a token of
esteem from the enlisted men whom he
commanded.
It was payday ln the Kansas regiment
yesterday, but one month's money was all
the men received. They will be mustered
out November 3.
The detachment from Battery N, Third
Artillery, now stationed at Benicia Bar
racks, will be relieved by a detachment*
from Battery E of the same regiment,
which will be sent from Fort Mason. The
detachment from Battery N will return to
its company's station, Alcatraz Island.

LUMBER DRIFTS ASHORE.
Residents of Bolinas Profit by the
Aberdeen's Loss.
BOLINAS. Oct. About 100,000 feet of
pine lumber which was washed from the
deck of the steamer Aberdeen last Tues
day while she was on her way from Port
land, Or., to San Francisco, floated into
Bolinas Bay last Friday. There was so
much of the lumber that for a half mile
from shore the ocean appeared yellow.
The Incident created a good deal of ex
citement, and for a while residents were
busily engaged in removing the lumber
from the. beach to their homes. All the
lumber now reposes in piles and .stacks
on the various ranches in the vicinity,
where it will lie used for firewood, as it
is cut into too large scantlings to be used
iii local building operations
It was on last Tuesday that the Aber
deen. Captain Pedersen, ; encountered a
fierce northwester off Point Reyes. The
lashings of the lumber which formed her
cargo broke loose and some of the lumber
getting caught in the rigging the main
mast of the steamer was carried away
Water poured into the engine-room and
the cabin and for a few minutes it was
feared that the fires would be extin
guished The vessel was turned bows on
and weathered the storm. She reached
Lombard-street wharf. San Francisco,
with about 500.000 feet of lumber and was
sent to Oakland Creek after discharging.

GENERAL GREEN'S VIEWS.
IF irrigation has a father in California that person
is General Will S. Green, whose views The Call
* published yesterday. We are of the opinion that
an examination of his position will show him that the
water storage movement is one solution of the very
difficulties which he presents. The present laws for
the enjoyment and distribution of water relate to the
normal flow of the streams and originate in riparian
rights. The application of the common law of ri
parian ownership has undergone certain statutory
modifications, and the water is subject to judicial
distribution, according to its use, but we need not
enter now into these details. They all concern the
normal flow and not the floods.
With the storage of flood waters we approach an
other view of the law of distribution that is not af
fected by riparian ownership nor subject to any of the
limitations now imposed.
As General Green is aware, many ditch and canal
companies which have sold permanent water rights that
go with the land have oversold. That is to say, their
tale of water has been measured not by the minimum
normal flow nor by the average, but by the maxi
mumâby that flow that fills the banks. The result
is that when dry years come and the flow is at the
minimum they cannot deliver the water they have
sold as a permanent right. While one may severely
impeach their lack of foresight, or may cail by a
harsher name their sale of water they cannot be sure
of possessing, hard judgment on them does not re
lieve the irrigator. He needs the water, and if the
ditch-owner can find it in a reservoir where flood
water is stored he can be compelled to get it and
fill his tracts.
Aside from this the distribution of flood water will
be independent of the difficulties now existing and so
well described by General Green. We hope to see
bim in the coming convention, for he has much to
teach and will meet there many who have much to
learn.
If Sir Thomas Lipton succeeds now in his boast
to "lift" the America challenge cup he will have to
be something more of a heavy-weight than he aspires
to be.
PATROL WAGON DRIVERS.
BY the recent order of the Board of Supervisors
\ discharging all patrol drivers now in the em
ploy of the city and placing the selection and
appointment of employes of that branch of the mu
nicipal service in the hands of the Police Department
a true reform was effected in the city administration.
It is therefore inevitable there should be opposition
to it. The bosses who profited by the old system
and who used the positions of patrol drivers as a part
of the spoils of oifice for distribution among their
follo'wcvs arc of course eager to set the reform aside
and return to- the old way. A movement has been
made in the Board of Supervisors to conform to their
wishes to a partial extent at least, and there is now
under consideration a motion to defer the date when
the reform is to go into effect from November I to
December 15.
The issue in the case is a simple one. If the patrol
drivers be placed under control of the Police Depart
ment there will be a clear responsibility in that de-
partment for the selection of proper men for the ser
vice. At present the places are given out at the dic
tation of ward bosses and are designed as rewards for
partisan activity rather than for the work of the
municipality. The patrol drivers are of course in
close relations with the police force and are virtually
a part of that force. It is therefore fitting they should
be under the control of that department.
Nor is there any good reason why the change hi
the system of appointment should be delayed. When
a thing is worth doing it is well to do it promptly. A
postponement now would be a precedent for another
postponement later on. The reform is a good one.
It io line with the progress which) has been made
in eliminating boss control from our politics. It is
oppo c ed only by Kelly and Crimmins and men of
that kind. It will work a marked improvement in
the patrol service and be also a help and an advan
tage to th.c Police Department in the performance of
the work that is required of it. It should therefore be
tamed as it standi.
MERCHANT MARINE SUBSIDIES.
COMMISSIONER of Navigation Chamber
lain has made an important contribution
to the discussion of the merchant marine
bill by an official report showing the amount
of subsidies paid to their commercial marine by the
greater nations of the globe. The showing is by no
means flattering to the United States', inasmuch as it
reveals that we are far behind our rivals in the race
for commercial supremacy.
Subsidies to shipping are granted for various pur
j poses, such as mail contracts, sen-ice in time of war,
: retainers to seamen, for the training of apprentices
and for fishing bounties. In none of these purposes
; does the United States offer such inducements as are
â  offered elsewhere. Taking the payments as a whole
! it is noted the United States stands far down on the
list, paying only $1,038,141 for ocean mails carried
in American vessels. France, which is making
strenuous efforts to build up a strong merchant fleet,
stands at the head of the list, with payments under
I various headings aggregating 532,242. Great Brit
] am comes next with $5,762,762 paid to ship-owners
and seamen as the contribution of the Government
toward maintaining British supremacy in ocean com
merce. Japan comes third with payments aggregat
ing $3492,107. These are amounts paid by other na
! tions: Italy, $2,185,266; Germany, $1,894,620; Aus
tria-Hungary, $1,724,249; Spain, $1,629,927; Russia,
I $1,168,187.
With that official record before them of what other
nations are doing to promote commerce it is certainly
to be expected that members of Congress will pass
a shipping subsidy bill at the coming session. Our
export and import trade is enormous, but it is car
ried almost wholly in foreign vessels. Senator Frye
estimates we pay $100,000 a day to foreign ship
owners for transporting our commerce, and the drain
makes a heavy reduction annually from our profits.
We have been liberal in providing for the up
building of our industries on land, and the results
have been so remarkable as to constitute one of the
marvels of the century. We are now able to manu
facture not only for our own needs but vast quantities
of goods for foreign markets. A similar policy of
protection and promotion carried out with respect to
our shipping would eventually enable American en
terprise to be as conspicuous on the seas as it is now
on land.
The issue was submitted to the people at the last
Presidential election. The Republican party at that
time took strong ground in favor of an American
merchant marine and gave an emphatic pledge to the
people to provide for its augmentation and expansion.
That pledge has not yet been fulfilled, and now an
other Presidential election is approaching. Under
such circumstances it is clearly the duty of Congress
to provide for our mercantile marine at the coming
session.
Since Mayor Phelan has assumed the dictatorship
of a "new Democracy" it would be within the realm
of Ids arrogated power to force some of his nomi
nees to bear the yoke quietly. Assessor Dodge in
sists that he is a party in himself, and the other
candidates must hustle for themselves. The creed
of the "new Democrats" appears to be everybody for
hints
CAMPAIGN BANNERS.
j AMOTION was made at "the meeting of the
/ \ Board of Supervisors on Monday evening to
i so amend the order forbidding the stretching
of campaign banners across the streets as to permit
thai nuisance on all streets except Market and
Kearny. Th inks to Supervisor Holland the board
was saved from hasty and inconsiderate action on the
subject and the motion vent over for reconsideration
at the next meeting.
The proposed amendment has nothing to justify it.
Either the promiscuous swinging of unsightly
stretches of canvas over our thoroughfares is a nui
sance or it rs not. If it be a nuisance why permit it
in any part of the city? If it be not a nuisance why
prohibit it on Market and Kearny? In what respect
are the people who pass along those streets entitled
to mofe consideration from the municipal authorities
than the people who pa- on other streets?
The order prohibiting that form of public nuisance
has been well received and cordially approved by the
community. There is no objection anywhere to the
artistic decoration of the streets with banners which
are in themselves bright and fair to look upon and
j which have a festal significance. Campaign banners,
fever, are anything rather than artistic. They are
simply huge advertising posters displaying in lurid
letters the name of some aspirant for office. They
mar the appearance of the streets and in many in
stances are as offensive to the mind as to the eye.
There is no reason why the streets should be given
up to that kind of advertising. Candidates for office
have many means by which to parade their names
and their virtues before the voters without granting
them the privilege of turning the streets into a pano
rama of flapping canvas with their names displayed.
Before the subject comes up for reconsideration the
Supervisors will have an opportunity to learn some
thing of public sentiment on'the matter. The political
banner stretched across the street is a serious nuisance
in the eyes of the great mass of the community.
There is a strong sentiment in favor of suppressing it,
and a grave mistake will be made if the recent well
approved order be rescinded or weakened by amend
ment or alteration.
H. H. Kohlsaat, the able editor of the Chicago
Times-Herald, is deservedly distinguished for ability
in many fields, but when the Chronicle framed his

aspire. lie has a fighting editor of his own.
MR. BRYAN'S LECTURE RATES.
W X BRYAN, according to all reports, has been
/ \ making a good deal of hay out of the political
* * sunshine which has been glowing so brightly
and warmly of late in the Mississippi Valley. A
special correspondent of the Philadelphia Record
quotes a Cabinet official as saying that for his speech
at Canton, 111., the silver aspirant for the Presidency
was paid $600, which is surely a good reward for a
two-hours' talk.
When asked by whom the money was subscribed
the official is reported to have said: "By the citizens
of the town and the people interested in the State
Fair which is in progress this week. Of course Bryan
is an attraction, and he brought several thousand peo
ple to town who would not have come otherwise.
Thus the subscribers had an opportunity to get their
money back. I assume it is all right for Mr. Bryan
to make money this way. Still, isn't it rather undig
nified for a man who poses as the leader of the
Democracy and as a prospective candidate for the
Presidency to accept money for his 'work of educat
ing the people?' " -
While the Record correspondent does not give
the name of the Cabinet official, the statement
TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1899.
; regarding the fee paid to Bryan for the Canton speech
j has been confirmed by reports from other sources.
j Whether it be dignified in a candidate for the Presi
dency to charge for addressing the people depends
i upon the kind of man who is posing as a candidate.
j It would be undignified in Admiral Dewey to charge
j for his appearance at any particular city, and it would
I be undignified for Cleveland or Harrison to seek to
j make money by such means. Bryan, however, is a
character unique in our politics. Stumping the coun
try at State fairs for coin is not undignified in him
because it comports well with all other of his per
formances. He has a right to lecture for coin and
it the people are willing to pay his price there is no
reason why he should not make a living that way.
It is a part of his habitual practice to serve the people
"for the money that is in it and not for the honor."
In his criticism of General Shaffer's conduct of
the campaign at Santiago Admiral Sampson prob
ably forgets that he had o only a long distance view
of the situation. And General Shafter adds, with a
touch of sarcasm, that in affairs warlike Admiral
Sampson has not yet won the honor of being a good
judge.
WHILE a considerable number of newspapers
/ have kept out of their columns all reports of
the brilliant successes achieved by the Mar
coni system of wireless telegraphy, it is to be noted
that the more influential journals in the East have
been superior to such petty jealousies and have given
to the work done for The Call and the Herald by
Marconi the most outspoken and cordial praise.
The Philadelphia Ledger, for example, says: "Al
though the yacht races have been inconclusive, the
Marconi system of wireless telegraphy has proved
beyond any question its practicability and value. It
has been employed under rather unfavorable condi
tions â that is to say, with the sending station on a
boat itching about in a rough sea and during foggy
weather â at all times with complete success. Not
a single hitch has occurred, and the number of mes
sages sent and received has far exceeded the ordin
ary demands upon a commercial line. The special
value of the bulletins sent from the Ponce to the
shore lines is that they record from the scene of the
race itself the events as they happen. The bulletins
sent from shore stations are unreliable estimates of
the positions of far distant yachts, which at times can
not be distinguished, and the messages sent from
other boats following the races are necessarily de
layed a long time before they reach land lines or
cables. Wireless telegraphy, therefore, has a field of
its own in reporting events at sea, and the uses of
the system are quite obvious."
The people of San Francisco have had a con
vincing proof that the estimate put upon the Mar
coni service by the Ledger, although high, is not in
any way exaggerated. The bulletins from the races
have been as full as the occasion called for, and, as
the Ledger says, they have in quantity of words ex
ceeded the ordinary demands upon a commercial
wire. Persons in this city watching The Call bulle
tins have kept pace almost with the yachts as they
sailed, the news of each incident of the race being
posted here within two or three minutes after it
occurred.
Wireless telegraphy has, in fact, been accom
plished. It cannot be ignored. Sooner or later the
very journals that now pass its marvels over without
a word of information to their readers will have to
take up the story and tell it. This yacht race will be
memorable in the history of the world, not because
of any particular distinction in itself, but because it
furnished a striking opportunity to attest to civiliza
tion the usefulness of wireless telegraphy and demon
strate its practical value not only to journalism but to
commerce.
Masterly inactivity is the official characterization
giving to the massing of troops, the shelling of ar
mored trains and the general confusion of war in
South Africa. The British press censor must be a
relative of the gentleman employed in like capacity
at Manila.
THE MISHAP TO THE SHAMROCK.
REGRET at the mishap to the Shamrock will
diminish the pleasure the American people feel
in the second victory of the Columbia. Sir
Thomas Lipton has shown himself to be so genuine
a sportsman and so thoroughly manly in all his ac
tions in connection with the race that he has won
the esteem and friendship of Americans, and in his
iii luck he has the cordial sympathy of all.
Of course the accident was one of the things the
j builders of the Shamrock should have guarded
I against. The object of the international contest is to
determine which nation can build the yachts best
fitted for ocean racing. Strength and stanchness are
qualities which in such yachts must count for as
much as speed. If in their efforts to gain a vast
spread of canvas the British overtax the strength of
the mast or other parts of their yacht they must
bear the loss. That was agreed upon at the time the
terms of the race were settled, and the rule is as fair
; for the one as the other.
That fact, however, will not in any way diminish
the regret over the accident. It is desired the races
should be free from mishaps to cither side. The
occurrence is the more regrettable because the race
in which it took place was one in which the British
have always claimed their yacht would show its best
points. If the Shamrock be beaten in the race on
Thursday she will not have another chance over a tri
angular course. Sir Thomas has not had the "Lipton
luck*' in this venture. He is a game sportsman, how
ever, and is not likely to be daunted by one disaster.
He has repeatedly said that if beaten in this match he
will come back next year with a better yacht. From
| that we may draw the conclusion he will enter the
next race with a stronger topmast, and the Ameri
can people will be glad if Iris good luck return and
give him weather which will show his gallant yacht at
i its best.
The United States officials who are now busy try
ing to explain why they permitted the Filipino fili
bustering steamer Pasig to change her name to the
Abbey might have known that some ships, like
some men,, change their names for no good purpose.

PAPA'S DARLING BOY.
DEWEY AND THE PRESIDENCY.
THE newspapers throughout the country have been discussing Admiral Dewey
and the Presidency. A large number consider that it will be the part of
wisdom for the fighting sailor to steer a clear course far away from the
turbulent sea of politics. Others are of the opinion that he has had honors
in abundance, while many of them enthusiastically declare the hero of Manila
Bay to be the ideal man for the place, and that, if nominated by either party,
he would sweep the country.
Brief editorial opinions follow:
SACRAMENTO BEE.
Dewey and Schley occupy positions to-day more exalted than the Presidency.
Either would be foolish to run the risk of marring his record by such mistakes
as were made by U. S. Grant. Besides, it is very doubtful if either Dewey or
Schley would make a good President. ,
Â» â¢ Â»
SAX JOSE HERALD.
The talk about making Dewey the Democratic candidate for President will
probably all end in talk. It is not likely that he would accept the nomination.
Â» Â« Â»
ARIZONA REPUBLICAN.
So far as drawing the hero of Manila into politics is concerned, the admiral
ought to be allowed to rest. He certainly has no intention of permitting the
politicians to juggle with his name.
â¢ â¢ â¢
SACRAMENTO RECORD-UNION.
All the acts and expressions of Dewey since he has come so prominently
into public life warrant the belief that he proposes to leave politics to those who
have been raised to it and have lived all their lives in a political atmosphere.
â¢ * Â» \
LOS GATOS MAIL.
To accept the candidacy for the Presidency next year, no matter of which
party, would be the worst thing that could happen to "our bold sailor boy."
â â¢â¦ , *
CHICAGO JOURNAL.
It is right for the American people to admire Dewey for his soldierly qualities
and reward him for doing his work so well. But if they are a cool-headed and
a shrewd people they will call on statesmen for statesmanship and keep their
warriors for war.
â¢ â¢ â¢
FARGO ARGUS.
If political straws show how the wind blows, and partly revealed signs of the
times indicate anything, then look out for a red-hot Democratic Dewey boom.
â¢ â¢ â¢
PITTSBURG DISPATCH.
Admiral Dewey has shown qualities of tact and judgment which might be
valuable in the White House. But the probabilities rise very nearly to the
stage of certainty that those very qualities will keep him out from between the
upper and nether millstones of politics.
* â¢ â¢ â¢
NEW WHATCOM REVEILLE.
Admiral Dewey would no doubt make a good President, but we venture the
assertion that the hero of Manila has had all the worry he wants and is receiv
ing enough glory and adulation to last him the rest of his days.
â¢ Â» â¢
SAN JOSE MERCURY.
Dewey has nothing to gain and he has all to lose either in the Presidency or
in pursuit of it. It is to be hoped that his great common-sense, combined with
his deep patriotic sense, will give him wisdom to heed his own calm judgment
and to put aside tho temptations of scheming President-makers.
Â» Â» Â»
CHICAGO CHRONICLE.
If Admiral Dewey shall seek the advice of friends they will tell him that he
should hesitate seriously before determining to compromise his fame by becom
ing a political candidate.
NASHVILLE AMERICAN.
We cannot be blind to the strength of Dewey nor his eminent fitness for the
exalted office of President. But in our opinion we shall have to content ourselves
with Admiral Dewey. His candidacy for the highest oflice in the gift of the
people is impracticable.
PHILADELPHIA TIMES.
We don't believe that Admiral Dewey wants to be President; but General
Tavlor was equally averse to it, and so was General Grant, and both accepted.
If called to the Presidency he couldn't refuse it, and it nominated by either
party without a platform he would sweep the country like a hurricane.
NEW HAVEN PALLADIUM.
The Presidency is within easy reach of this splendid hero. He has but to
say the word and he will be swept into the oflice on a. swell of popular enthusiasm
and affection as resistless as the tidal waves of the West indies.
NEW YORK SUN.
Admiral Dewey's determination to be himself, which is another way of speak
ing of his resolution to remain a plain admiral, will surely be disregarded by the
political schemers, and he must be prepared to face the prospect of a bombard
ment of them, compared with which the discharge of an enemy's batteries m a
naval battle is nothing. , Â»?â¢â¢*â¢
LOS ANGELES EXPRESS.
Admiral Dewey has not the training and experience for the position; neither
is he adapted for the place by temperament or education, and he could not be
elected even If he were to run, which he will not do. For Dewey to enter politics
would be the shattering of a national hero, and the result would be disastrous to
that hero's fame. ...
COLUSA SUN.
Dewey has been talked about as a candidate for the Presidency, but it is to
be hoped that he will not run. He has so far carried a level head, and has re
ceived all the honors a nation can give.
SAN D I EGAN SUN.
Admiral Dewey cannot finally and forever demonstrate the horizontallty of his
head better than by peremptorily refusing to enter into any new contest for fame
or glory or responsibility. He has done well enough. - v
PHILADELPHIA RECORD.
Let him be President if he will, but in such fashion that the Presidency shall
in no wise diminish the fame of the admiral.
SPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN.
As Grant was after the Civil War, so Dewey Is now. The past has shown that
it is possible to persuade reticent men hitherto devoted to the art of war under
certain circumstances to consider the claims of politics.
NEW HAVEN REGISTER.
It is a comfort and a consolation to lift the hat to something real and sub
stantlal. What wonder, under the circumstances, that men should seek to uÂ«Â«
him in uncongenial ways and elect him President! His is the spirit and th*
courage they are unconsciously groping about for. v lue
SAVANNAH NEWS.
There Is undoubtedly a very large portion of the people who would like to see
him President because they have confidence^ his patriotism, honesty and ability.
BOSTON POST.
Whatever party might put Admiral Dewey ln nomination for the Presldencv
he would make a tremendous draft on the forces of the opposition Th* nnrJJ*
ination would be practically equivalent to an election. ' me nom

The Best Food
for Infants
Nature planned that infants
should have only milk for at
least the first year of life. But
thin milk, skimmed milk, will
no* nourish. It's the milk that
is rich in cream, or fat, that
does the work. This is be-
cause fat is positively neces-
sary for the growing "body.
Scoffs Emulsion
contains the best fat, in the
form of Cod-Liver Oil, for all
delicate children.
They thrive greatly under its use.
Soon they weigh more, eat more,
play better and look better. It's just
the right addition to their regular
food. The hypophesphites cflime
and soda in it are necessary to the
growth and formation of bone and
teeth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18. 1899.
SWINGING INTO LINE
FOR HON. HORACE DAVIS
Republican Committee Organize
for Immediate Work.
Movement in Assembly Districts for Davis
and Good Governmentâ Pheian and
McNab Alarmed.
Â£____jHE new executive committee of the
Republican County Committee, Al
fred Bouvler chairman, met at the
L History buildins last night and
adopted a plan of campaign. Per
manent organization at the â¢ }"â¢
was effected without delay. The chair
man and secretary of the County Com
mittee were chosen as such oflicers of the
executive body. Max Goldberg was elect
ed vice chairman and will preside when
Mr. Bouvler cannot be* on deck.
A proposition presented by Alex Tru
man to create a campaign committee of
seven members elicited discussion. Mr.
McCarthy desired that the duties of the
campaign committee fhould be clearly de
fined at the outset so that no clash should
occur later on.
Mr. Truman understood that it would
he the duty of the campaign committee
to provide * for meetings in the various
Assembly districts, to see that halls wore
engaged, bands hired, speakers secured
and proper announcement be given of the
meetings. In this work committeemen
representing the Assembly districts should
of course lend a helping hand. Mr. Tru
man referred to the necessity of present
ing plain facts to the people. Mention
was made that Mayor Phelan was patting
himself on the breast and claiming the
credit for the reform work accomplished
by Supervisors Dr. Perrault, John Lack-
I mann and Albert I lever.
Mr. McCarthy feared that the campaign
I committee might usurp the powers and
! privileges of the district committeemen,
j ills apprehension of danger in this re
! gard was removed when lt was resolved
that the chairman and secretary of the
executive body should be ex-offlclo mem
bers of the campaign committee, and that
there should be weekly meetings of the
committee throughout the campaign.
Max Goldberg Insisted tliat there should
be a committee clothed with authority to
; act and to be accountable to the general
bod} for the engagement of halls, the
hiring of bands and the disbursement of
money for the expenses of the various
j meetings. Mr. Goldberg advocated a vig
j orous campaign. He was encouraged by
I the report of Republican unity and the
evidences of Republican enthusiasm, but
recognized the necessity for active work
In each of the Assembly districts. He
| contended that certain powers should be
delegated to the campaign committee,
j and that the committeemen in the respec
i tive Assembly districts should co-operate
i with the campaign committee to bring out
'. tho voters to attend the meetings.
Alex Truman's motion that the chair
I appoint a campaign committee of seven
I prevailed. Later in the evening Chair
man Bouvler named the following to com
pose the committee:
Alex. Truman,
J. R. Hillman,
H. C. Henderson,
A. J. Martin,
L. A. Rea,
I. Ascherm,
J. R. McNamara,
The subject of securing quarters sepa
rate from the headquarters of the Horace
Davis Central Club was discussed. A. J.
Martin moved that a committee of three
be appointed to engage suitable rooms,
but withdrew the motion in favor of a
suggestion made by Mr. Brandt that the
chairman be authorized to select the quar
ters. Mr. Bouvler spoko of desirable
rooms in the Baldwin Annex, already fur
nished.
Alter effecting permanent organization
1 the committee went into executive ses
sion to discuss detailed plans for conduct
ing the campaign to a victorious finish..
Reports were submitted showing that
many prominent citizens of Republican
faith who had given their support to
Mayor Phelan in two contests were now
using their energies and Influence to se
cure tlie ''â â â â  '."ii of Horace Davis.
From every district of the city word
comes that the old-line Democrats who
were excluded from a voice in party
councils by Phelan and McNab
have resolved to withhold their
' support from the nominees of the McNab
convention, The Committee of One Hun
dred will be asked to get its votes from
the source where it derived authority to
manage the partyâ the Democratic
State Central Committee.
The Republican leaders are now con
vinced that Horace Davis will be elected.
He will be elected by a large majority of
the Republicans who supported Phelan
last November and who will return to
their party fold. Pheian's success last
-nil. or was obtained by the knifing of
Judge Maguire Phelan Democrats voted
for Gage in return for Republican votes
for Phelan, and so it happened that Pat
ton '.â ! Maguire were slaughtered. Spe
cial precautions will be taken to prevent
such knifing tactics at the next election.
McNab Democrats v.ill vote for Phelan.
the free silver or Bryan Democrats will
vote for the ticket of the People's party
if the candidate for Mayor thereon is not
objectionable, and the Republicans will
vote for Horace Davis and the entire Re
publican ticket.
After the adjournment of the executive
session hist night Alfred Bouvler an
nounced the appointment of A. W. Branch
os assistant secretary of the County Com
mittee. Mr. Branch, who has had expe
rience in campaigns with the Republican
State Central Committee, will enter at
once upon the discharge of his duties.
The Republican nominees have been in
vited to meet the executive committed nt
j the County Committee headquarters 723
Market street, tonight at 8 o'clock", to
! confer with that body on campaign ques
i tions.
DISTRICT DEMOCRATS.
Municipal Nominees Plead in
California Hall for Elec
tion.
The district campaign of the local De
mocracy began last night with a mass
meeting for the Forty-third District Club
ln California Hall. It was long after 8
o'clock before the crowd was sufficiently
large to warrant calling the meeting to
order. The chairman, P. 11. McCarthy,
then called attention to previous local
Democratic victories and drew from them
an inspiration and a hope for another.
With this dubious encouragement Etnli
Pohll, one of the Democratic nominees for
Supervisors, was introduced. He spoke
thoughtfully of the duties of a Supervisor
under the charter and pledged his hearers
in the event of his election to fulfill every
duty honestly, thoroughly and with unre
mitting energy. Equality of rights with
out distinction of class will be his princi
ple of official action, he said, as a Super
visor. Ho was heartily cheered and gave
place to Mayor Phelan.
The Mayor was received with three
cheers and a tiger. He spoke briefly upon
practically the same lines as on Monday
night. His only important digression was
a discussion of what now appears to be to
him a bugbearâ national politics. Ills
Honor indicates very clearly that he has
not only involved himself in Inconsisten
cies, but has seriously offended members
of hLs own party. If they are Democrats
and believe ln national Democratic prin
ciples and Issues, then he ls not, believing
and advocating only local principles. So
his Honor strove last night to show that
he Is a Democrat no less than a "charter
lst."
He Insisted that the local Democracy Is
in close sympathy to the people; the Re
publican party antagonistic to and fearful
of the people. According to the campaign
logic of his Honor the Democracy has
given us the primary law and the charter
and by right of reward and superior
knowledge is entitled to the Initial admin
istration of city affairs under the charter.
In municipal policy he claimed the De
mocracy is the party of progress, pledged
to permanent and liberal public improve
ments that shall not be delayed. The De
mocracy, he insists, has shown Its fairness
and its purpose to inaugurate a local gov
ernment that shall not be partisan, that
shall take forever from partisan politics
the employes of local departments. He
therefore asked the votes of his hearers
and begged them to go to bed early the
night before election and get up early, be
cause the day is not a legal holiday.
Again he was cheered and gave place to
Dennis Geary, who promised all sorts of
things in the event of his election. The
Mayor is still insisting upon a straight
ticket and it must have been some satis
faction to him last night to see that As
sessor Dodge has seen the error of his
ways and ha 3 been reconciled to his own
reproachful designation of "Knownoth-
Ing" in straight voting.
Ho was positive last night that the
straight Democratic must be voted. His
change of heart came in a night. He had
his charts with him again last night and
it begins to look as if hundreds of inno
cent people are going to be inflicted with
the long story or Assessor Dodge's good
ness as related by Assessor Dodge.
During his . address Assessor Dodge
asked his hearers to believe that he is '
being bitterly opposed by tho capitalistic
class, which, he said, he is forcing to pay
taxes hitherto escaped. "As an instance
of this." the speaker continued, "I will
mention the opposition of The Call to me.
I am opposed by that paper because I
have increased the assessable valuation
of the property of its proprietor by
$600,000."
After he had concluded his address
Assessor Dodge asked the representative
of The Call at the meeting to make no
mention of his remark. "I became ex
cited," he declared, "and did not intend
to say what 1 did. I am sorry I spoke so."
Jeremiah Deasy followed the Assessor
and told briefly and plainly that if elected
Sheriff he will be true to that trust which
makes him the guardian of the interests
of the living, which demand equal justice
for rich and poor. Patrick Boland fol
lowed and promised that if elected Public
Administrator he will be true to the more
sacred trust, the trust to the dead, who
have lost the power to defend themselves
and must rely upon the honor of him Into
whose hands their affairs have passed. '
Most of the other Democratic nominees
followed with short addresses. George
Cabaniss, Edmor.d Godchaux, James P.
Booth, J. F. Dwver, A. B. Maguire, P. J.
Curtis, Osgood Putnam and Franklin K.
Lane spoke upon the Issues of the munici
pal campaign, and the assembly adjourned
with three cheers for the ticket.
A REPUBLICAN RALLY.
A large and enthusiastic meeting ot the
Thirty-fourth Assembly District Repub
lican Club was held Monday evening at
Mission Native Sons' Hall on Seventeenth
street. Permanent organization was ef
fected, Clifford MeClellan being elected
president and Edward W. Close secretary.
Eloquent addresses were delivered by
Senator F. W. Burnett. R. B. MeClellan.
George Dietterle and others In support of
the nominees of the Republican party
amid great enthusiasm.
The following resolution was unani
mously adopted:
Be it resoved. That this club do hereDy
indorse the nominees of the Republican
party now before the people for the com
ing municipal election in this city.
The club quartet rendered several plead
ing campaign songs, which met with de
mands for more, and which were grace
fully given. A meeting will be held next
Monday evening at the same hall.
YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
The Young Men's Republican Club was
organized last evening at 7S Shipley street.
After numerous speeches and a good timo
socially the following named officers Were
elected: President, J. lieno; vice presi
dent, George Green; sergeant at arms,
Terrence McCabe; secretary, Horatio
Waterhouse. Fifty citizens signed the
roll and several stirring speeches were
made and S. M. Godsell and Charles Box
ton were cheered to the echo. The presi
dent Informed the members that there
would be an array of speakers at the next
meeting.
NATHAN BIBO CLUB.
The Nathan Bibo Club has secured !
headquarters with Scott & Harris, 18 Post :
street. Mr. Bibo's campaign for Super- !
visor will be conducted in a lively man
ner. His friends will be welcomed at

CONFIDENT REPUBLICANS.
Five hundred members of the different
Republican clubs of the Thirty-fifth Dis
trict assembled at 3296 Mission street last
evening and organized a joint club for the
purpose of taking an active port in the
coining election. It will be known as the
"Horace Davis Republican Club." W. F.
Warren and E. H. Herrick were elected
president and secretary respectively.
Meetings are to be held every evening in
different parts of the district. Last even
ing ex-Senator T. C. Maher and .Tud.-,e
Scnell were present and addressed the
assemblage.
, â¦
REPUBLICANS LINED UP
The Thirty-ninth Assembly District
Club has opened headquarters at 407 Hyde
street for the campaign. The head
quarters will not close, day or night, until
the day of election. This district is the
banner Republican district of the city and
it may be an assured fact that Hon.
Horace Davis and the nominees on the
ticket with him will get a rousing ma
jority from the Thirty-ninth. With such
stanch workers as Thomas H. McCarthy,
the president of the club; Frank 1).
Worth, A. A. I.otiderback, Amos Currier
and others there will be shoulder-striking
hits for good government in that club.

NEW OPERA WILL BE
PRODUCED NEXT WEEK
"THE CONSPIRATORS" WILL BE
PUT ON BY MOROSCO.
Music by H. J. Stewart and Libretto
by Clay M. â Favorable
Opinions Expressed by
the Critics.
On Monday evening next an entirely
original comic opera, "The Conspirat
ors," will be produced by the Morosco
Opera Company at the Grand Opera
house. The music has been composed by
IT. J. Stewart and the libretto is the
work of the well-known playwright, Clay
M. Greene. It will receive Its first pro
duction on any stage next Monday even
ing.
The scene is laid In Spain during the
middle sixteenth century. The plot Is ro
mantic and at the same time comic.
By those who have an opportunity of
reading the opera and hearing the music
the composition is said to resemble In
style that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, and the
libretto the Gilbertian order. The char
acters are such that will allow clever In
terpretation on the part of the Morosco
Opera Company. One striking feature of
the opera is the Introduction of a number
of pretty and catching songs, running the
gamut from solo to sextet.
Among the principal numbers are in
cluded: Solo, "An Avalanche of Petti
coats"; song and ensemble, "The Inev
itable Thing"; solo, "When I Am Free";
duet, "The Lady Killer"; solo, quartet
and chorus. "Loving's Quite the Thing to
Do"; quartet, "Let l's One and All in
Blissful Thrall"; "The Conspirators'
Chorus"; Bravura song, "El Castlllno a
la Mode"; solo. "Why Is This World
Made Up of Sighing?" song. "1 Do De
vote My Life to You"; song, "What a
Distressing Quandary"; song, "Indiscrim
inate Love"; "The Kiss Duet"; sextet.
"We Saw It With Our Eyes"; duet, "A
Socail Fad"; song, "Why Should Wom
an's Heart Go Begging?" duet, "This Is
No Life but Love"; recitative and ensem
ble, "Come to the Altar"; quarreling duet,
"Chorus of Mad Maidens"; "The Savage
and the Boomerang." Great attention has
been paid to the choruses, which will be
found fascinating and melodious. A
charming incident of act three will be a
novel ballet of beautiful dancing girls,
which has been invented for the occasion
by the stage manager of the Grand Opera
house, Charles 11. Jones. This will be the
cast: Don Juanlto Alverado, Edith Ma
son; Don Umberto Alverado, his tern pa
rent, Arthur Wooley; Friar Santal, his tu
tor, Nace Bonville; Don Castanetto, a
court fopling, Thomas H. Persse; Don
Fillipo Cassanova, chief of the conspira
tors, William Wolff; the King of Spain,
Wlnfred Goff; the Queen of Spain, Bes
sie Fairbairn; Isabella Cassanova, Don
Fillipns daughter, Hattie Belle Ladd;
Ghona Malarin, Georgie Cooper; Mariana,,
Jeanette Fredericks; Serphina, Ida St.
Aubin; Sister Alicia, mother superior of
the convent, Alice Gray; Ferdinand, a
page, Mabel Hilliard; monks, nuns, ladies

Dan walked to his corner as If it was
nil over, but Ready was up at the count

his left to the body and Ready countered
on the jaw. Another right on the jaw

DANIEL WAS
PLAYED FOR
A "KILLING."
Caesar Young's Two- Year-
Old Put a Crimp in the
Ring at Oakland.
Caesar Toung, the St. Louis bookmaker, !
carved a large-sized, cherry-ripe water
melon at Oakland yesterday with a two
year-old rejoicing in the name of Daniel.
The youngster started in a handicap on
October 5, finishing absolutely last. In
the opening scramble yesterday for maid
ens, with a field of eleven lining up at the
! barrier, he was played down from 30 to 4
and 6 to 1 and won ail the way. His vic
tory can. in a measure be ascribed to the
. start, for Jack Ward beat the gate. Alee,
the favorite, a brown colt, by St. George-
Levee, owned by Garnet Ferguson, was
best, but got away from the post none too
well. He ran a very impressive race, fin
ished third, seven lengths behind Slsquoc.
The ring had quite a crimp put in it over
the two-year-old's win.
In the other events decided favorites In
| the betting finished first on three occa
* sions. The track was still a trifle slow,
! but to-day will find it in as good condition
as before the rain.
Bald-laced Satsuma made his initial bow
'to tne public in the laat race. He looked
I well and warmed up as if fit to crack a
record. The crowd packed him from 2 to
1 to i) to 5 favoritism, and Humidity led
: from start to finish. The mare stopped so
I badly in her last race that she was prac
â  tlcaliv overlooked In the belling, her odds
receding to 7 and 8 to I. The six furlongs
were covered in 1:15 Hat. the best perform
ance of the day. Horton at the start com
manded first call in the books, but went
back and was beaten for the show by
Morinel.
It looked like tempting a bid-up to enter
Midity in a selling race for $300, but for-
I tunately for Johnny Humphrey the fast
I filly escaped one. At odds of 1 to 7 she
scampered away frcm her company ln the
second number, a sprint over the Futurity
I course. Druidess, with Jones up, took
the place from Gundara, a Midlothian
' filly. with a well developed flight of speed.
The long-striding black horse Faver
sham seemed afflicted with all sorts and
sizes of speed, placing the purse for the
mile selling to the credit of Atkin &
I Lottrldge. Ruiz took daring liberties
with him, holding the black fellow up in
his lap for two-thirds of the journey, and
' through the stretch was obliged to shake
him up to win out. Watossa, a2sto 1
shot, downed Fortis. the second choice,
> for the place. The latter's under
pinning showed want of repair and ins
price went from 7 to 5 to 2. Katie Gib
bons, the Honlg entry, led for six fur
longs, when she tired and fell to the rear.
Dr Rowell's entry. Whltcomb. captured
! the seven-furlong selling affair without
much effort. The gelding was speedily
played down in the ring to 7 to 10 favorit
ism*, and the rank outsider. Kootenai, with
Coburn in the saddle, was the only one
to give him the semblance of a contest.
That horse made a very good showing,
' finishing a close second, half a length be
fore Una Colorado.
Track Notes.
Presiding Judge Murphy yesterday re
ceived a telegram from Captain Rees
stating that Jockey Duffy had not been
reinstated by him. The matter will be
referred to the Pacific Coast Jockey
Club, It being possible that the stewards
of that association may have lifted the
rider's suspension.
It was stated on good authority last
evening that Colonel Applegate of Louis
ville, Ky.. has secured the Held book privi
legefor Tanforan Park,
Bookmaker Johnny Humphrey occa
sionally makes a mild flier on the prize
fights, " and is backing Erne to beat
O'Brien On Monday evening the colored
plunger. Johnson, was skirmishing about
in search of Erne money, and met Hum
phrey and Charley Fair. Johnson was
willing to bet at evens and the turfman
made him a wager of $2000 that the lignt
weight champion would lower the colors
of Hawkins' conqueror, each putting up
half of the amount.

SNOWBOUND HUNTERS.
F. H. Bushnell and "Johnnie" Cole-
man Endure Hardships in the
Sierras.
F. H. Bushnell and Bookmaker
"Johnnie" Coleman arrived home last
night after a siege of hardships in the
mountains back of AVeber Lake, where
they were snowbound for over a week.
Bushnell. Coleman and "Joe" EpÂ»lnger
left here several weeks ago for Weber
Lake, where they beat the thick under
brush for game and whipped the streams
for trout. The trio pitched their camp in
the mountains back of the lake, many
miles from civilization.
Epplnger tired of the sport quickly and
return..', home, leaving his companions to
stay longer.
A day or so later a severe snowstorm
set in and Bushnell and Coleman had to
brave the elements. The snow fell
heavily, and before they realized their
position they were hemmed in. At the
inn at Weber Lake it was known that the
hunters were camping somewhere back
in the mountains, and when the weather
cleared up a searching party was Bent out
to locate them. They searched for several
days and finally located the snowbound
sportsmen in a lonely canyon.
Several times during the snowstorm
Bushnell and Coleman attempted to make
their way out of the mountains, but each
time they had to turn back. i'ntil the
rescuing party reached them they were
beginning to think they would never see
civilization again. Both vow they will
never go into the mountains again with
out 1 a guide.

Alaskan Agreement Is
Being Completed.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON", Oct. 17.â Immediately
upon Secretary Hay's return to-day prep
arations began at the State Department
for the completion of th*Â» modus Vivendi
relative to the Alaskan boundary. Gen
eral Foster was hard at work upon the
details of the modus and the expectation
was that ln the course of a day or two
the agreement would be In effect. The
negotiations of late havo been entirely in
the hands of Secretary Hay and air.
Tower, the British Charge here. It has
not been determined even yet whether ,
the agreement defining the boundary
temporarily shall take the form of a docu
ment signed by both parties or be merely
a series of notes, but In either case it will
be Just as effective as a regular modus
Vivendi, binding both parties to observe
the boundary laid down temporarily.
State Department officials are confident
that Americans will have no cause to
complain that their rights have been
abandoned when the full scope of the
agreement is made known, while, on the
other hand, the Canadians cannot claim
properly that they have lost any right
that they have enjoyed.
The purpose of this particular effort at
a modus was to regulate the boundary
line on the west side of the Lynn Canal.
The two parties bad placed the line of
demarcation on Chileat and White
passes right at the top of the passes, and
there has never been the slightest fric
tion at those points. But. because of the
fact that the westernmost of the three
passesâ namely, Chilcat Passâ was fully
forty miles removed from the sea, the
same rule could not be applied by our

CATTLE ENDANGERED.
Large Herds Imprisoned by Snow in
the Mountains.
' PLACERVILLE, Oct. 17.â The road over
the summit is now open and the large
bands of dairy and stock cattle, number^
ing thousands, that find summer pasture
age ln Lake Valley are now passing
through this city on their way to winter
pasturage in this and Sacramento coun
ties.
Grave fears are entertained that many
cattle that were pastured on the higher
ridges will not be saved. Bayne Bros.,
extensive cattle raisers of Coloma, have a
large band imprisoned ln the snow back
of Pyramid Peak. The snow at that point
Is reported to be nearly six feet ln depth.
Barrett. Orelli, Basi and other cattle
men have large numbers yet In the moun
tains, but hope is felt that if the present
weather continues they will be able to
save them.
Whitecaps Harass Negroes.
BARNESVILLE, Ga., Oct. 17.â An in
vestigation Into the disturbances here, as
a result of which the local military com
pany was called out last night to protect
the Oxford cotton mills from a supposed
mob of negroes, shows that the negroes
came to the town seeking protection from
whitecaps. The negroes claim some ot
their race were roughly handled by the
whitecaps. The Capital City Guards, a

been summoned to its armory to await
orders to come to Barnesville, has been

Golden Gate Park Driving; As-
sociation Offers an Ettract-
ive Programme
The members of Golden Gate Park j
Driving Association met at the Palace |
Hotel last night and completed arrange
ments for their autumn meeting. This ,
will be held at Ingleside racetrack on j
Saturday.
The most interesting feature of the j
programme will be a double team race. |
in the olden days this was a favorite j
form of sport, but in recent years it* has
languished. It was revived successfully \
on the circuit, which encouraged the ama- I
teur drivers to try their hand at the |
exciting sport. With three or four teams â 
to start, the event should be an interest- i
ing one. It will be best two out of three I
heats, as will all the other races. The
remaining ones are a 2:20 class, 2:40 class
and the second contest for the Frank G.
O'Kane trophy.
After extended discussion, it was de
cided to do away with the race which it j
was intended should be trotted under un- |
usual conditions. It will be straight two
in three heats, as it was believed that |
otherwise an Injustice would be done :
some owners. The object of the associa- ;
tion is to provide good sport for its mem- i
bers and to increase the number of gen- !
tlemen drivers. The purse in each race i
will be $100, divided into three moneys of |
60 per cent, 25 and 15. In the cup race J. j
C. Ohlandt has one victory to his credit,
but must win it three times in all to make I
it liis property. Admission will be free to
the races. 'The following officers will

UNITE TO FIGHT
THE RAILROAD
Meeting of Citrus Fruit
Growers and Packers.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RIVERSIDE, Oct. 17â Southern
California Fruit Exchange and the out
side packers have united to fight rail
road discriminations in transportation.
The Citrus Fruits Growers', Packers'
j and Shippers' Association in session here
1 this afternoon adopted, with but one dis
senting vote, a resolution to carry the
fight into the Federal courts If necessary,
and the Southern California Fruit Ex
change will co-operate. The only dis
senting vote was the Earl Fruit Com-
Eany, which stands for and reaps the
benefit of a private car line. The reso
lution is as follows:
Whereas, The welfare of any Industry de
mands that freight rate discriminations do not
exist in any form, and as shipping factors en
gaged In handling the product of the citrus
orchards of California we view with especial
favor any plan promulgated by the carriers
that promises relief from the pernicious and ille
gal system of rebates from the taTiff rates, and
will lend our -Tdlal assistance as Individuals
and an organization to any reasonable plan
for the absolute elimination of freight rate dis
criminations. We believe that the payment of
rebates perverts the influence of shipping fac
tors from the interests of the growers to that of
the carrying lines. We protest against and will
antagonize any plan of the railroad companies
| which effects only a partial elimination of the
rebating and which grants special privileges
i to favored Interests through the medium of pri-
I vate car lines; and.
Whereas, The present transportation arrange
' ments, as provided for the citrus traffic of 1899
--1900, under the pretext of accomplishing the
elimination of freight concessions, do clearly
provide >r the special privileges of car lines,
which privileges have been granted to some
shippers and denied to others, and as this In
side advantage, enjoyed by certain Interests,
â¢ can only result ln disadvantage to the Industry
and the community It supports; therefore be It
Resolved. That the policy of the Initial lines,
as now understood, is openly defiant of the In
terstate commerce laws and inimical to the
welfare of the Industry, for which reason the
powers of the Federal courts should be In
voked to correct the flagrant evils now exist
ing.
The Jamaica treaty was considered and
a resolution adopted to co-operate with
the Southern California Citrus Traffic,
Committee to raise a fund to defeat the'
confirmation of the treaty. This resolu
tion was sent, with greetings, to the
growers' meeting in session here at the
same time. The grawers' meeting resolv
ed unanimously to levy one-fifth of a
â¢cent per box for the tariff fund.
TROUBLES OF MRS.
ANNA KLINE RIKERT
President of the Stockton and Tuol
umne Company Involved in
Litigation.
STOCKTON, Oct. 17.â John MeCormick
yesterday recovered Judgment In Judge
Budd's court against the National Se
curity Company for approximately $7000.
The suit was an outgrowth of the litiga
tion over the "Woman's Road," of which
Mrs. Rikert was the president, and which
was incorporated under the name of the
Stockton and Tuolumne Railway Com
pany. MeCormick furnished meat for the
workmen and advanced money from time
to time to the president of the road.
Being convinced that it was a bad debt
to have outstanding he began suit to re
cover and got an attachment on a lot
of rails which the company had stored
in this city. Mrs. Rikert was very anx
ious to get the attachment released and
sought the aid of the security company.
For the usual fees and the custody of the
rails the company agreed to release the
attachment. The rails would revert to
the custody of the Sheriff ln case a judg
ment was secured by the plaintiff.
In due time this judgment was secured
and demand was made on the security
company for the return of the rails. The
company could not return them, as they
had been sold. Suit accordingly followed
on the bond. The company may not lose
entirely on the deal, as it Is presumed
that it secured itself out of proceeds of
| the sale of the rails. Notice of appeal was
| given.
Want a New Charter.
PASADENA, Oct. 17.â T0-day President
Daggett of the Board of Trade memorial
ized the City Council for a new charter,
asking that a committee of three be ap
pointed to look up and draft a new char
ter. He asked the Council to call an elec
tion of the people to elect fifteen free
holders, they to call another election on
the charter. The present charter is sixth
class. A special charter Is needed, be
cause now sufficient sewers, parks and
other Improvements cannot be had. nor
can kindergartens be introduced In the
public schools on account of the. fact that
the District Attorney, who Is not In fa
vor of them, is given too much power.
Tho Council filed the memorial and ex
pressed a favorable sentiment, but made
the objection that sewers and other Im
provements demanded by the -Board of
Trade would cost between half a million
and a million dollars. Last Saturday the
ladies of the Shakesepeare Club, the prin
cipal literary organization of this city,
met and bound themselves to work for
the new charter.
Captain O'Brien Dead.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 17.â Captain Charles

Michigan, but came to the mines in 1865
and has been there since. He was 65
years old.
OLYMPIC MEN
RENDEZVOUS
AT ESCALLES
A Notable Gathering of Ath
letes Arranged by the '
Club's Directors.
The members of the Olympic Ath
letic Club will "get together" next
Sunday in greater numbers than
they have done in many years.
They are to be the guests of the club at
Escalles, a resort between Sausalito and \
San Rafael, where, in addition to a fine j
dinner, they will be entertained by noted I
funmakers, besides taking part in im- j
promptu games.
In the early history of the club any af
fair that attracted one member attracted j
all. Whenever Haley, Schifferstein, J
Flynn, O'Kane or any of the club's sprint- j
ers were competing they always had a
following. In later years the big mem- I
bership of the club has been scattered
among the "annexes." The wheelmen i
flocked by themselves. The gunmen, |
swimmers, runners, athletes, handball- :
players and others all had seperate or- I
ganizations within the parent body. Each
developed and thrived, but sapped in a â 
degree the life of the big club. It is to
bring all the members together in one i
great body that the affair of Sunday has j
been arranged.
The officers of the various annexes will
endeavor to bring out their full strength.
The affair was originally suggested by
Captain George James. Leader John A.
Hammersmith, John Elliott and other di- |
rectors approved of it and are working iO
make It a success. James W. Coffroth, j
"Tom" Cunningham and others who were
responsible for the success of former out
ings of the Wheelmen, on the same lines, j
are interested in the successful outcome
of this venture.
The members of the club can go to the
rendezvous on either the 8, 10 or 11:30 a. m.
boat by way of Sausalito. The Wheelmen
may go on one of the early boats and
reach Escalles after a short spin over the
; road, possibly from San Rafael.
BOOM IN CHINESE GAMBLING.
Four New Fantan Houses Opened
for Business.
The Chinese quarter of tho city is
showing unmistakable signs of being af
fected with the tidal wave of prosperity
which is sweeping over the country. The
prosperity of Chinatown, however, arises
from a purely local causeâ the return of
cannery hands from up the coast.
The first evidence of an influx of "easy
money" is seen in the gambling dens
which abound for the delectation of Mon
golians, and during the past few weeks
the business of these shady houses has
been so brisk and they have been run
with so little police molestation that new
places have blossomed out, some of them
most elaborate affairs, and now the Ce
lestial sport finds no trouble in enjoying
the pleasures of peegow and fantan.
At 44 Waverly place more than $1000
has been expended in ornate decorations
of a room where all the Chinese gam
are played. This place, as well as one
at 802 Dupont street and one at SID 1 -
Washington street and one on St. Louis
alley. opened Its doors to the Chinese
public during the past week, and reports
from those who have the entree say that
fantan has never before seen such a
boom.
The returning canners have saved up
quite a respectable sum. and the boom in
Mongolian gambling will last until it has
changed hands.

DEBTS HASTEN
THE DEATH OF
THE ACME CLUB
It Will Cease to Exist After
To-Day â Members Join
Other Clubs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 17.
Tlie Acme Club will go out of existence
to-morrow. A constable will sell the per
sonal property of the club to satisfy the
! judgment in favor of the landlords, and
j the athletic organization which began
fourteen years ago in a barn in a back
! yard, with an old pair of boxing gloves
j and with DeWitt Van Court for in
| structor, will pass into history.
To-day President Fitzgerald of the Re
liance Club received a little note from the
Sheriff apprising him of the sale and sug
gesting that as the athletic furnishings
are not likely to cause much competition,
the Reliance Club might possibly become
a customer.
"For several weeks," said .President
Fitzgerald, "the boards of directors of
both clubs have been discussing the ad
visability of uniting. It has long been
apparent that two big athletic clubs can
not prosper in this city. When the at
tachment was levied on the Acme Club
a crisis was reached and as things are
at present about two hundred of the best
athletes of the Acme Club will come to
us. There will be no need of any con
solidation, and it is better that there be
none. No matter which club went to the
other, the remaining club would have to
assume the indebtedness of the other.
There will be no advantage in a formal
union, because each club has a thorough
gymnastic outfit and is well furnished,
and if we bought the Acme outfit we
could only store it to replace our own
in years to come, which would not bo
good business policy.
: "There are now about four hundred
members of the Reliance Club and since
we went into our present fine building
more than one-half of our total indebted
ness has been paid off. With the big ad
dition we shall receive when the Acme
Club goes out of existence I anticipate
no trouble in maintaining a splendid
organization that will win many honors.
In several contests, especially in wheel
contests, the Acme and Reliance clubs
have each nearly scored a victory. With
the pick of the two clubs we could have
done as we pleased, and that is what I
anticipate we shall soon be doing.
"I presume a certain number of the
Acme Club will Join the new West Oak
land Athletic Club, but I cannot see that
this will in any way Interfere with the
progress of the enlarged Reliance Club.
"With only one big club in town giv
ing boxing exhibitions we shall be able
to do better financially in more ways than
one. Our dues at present are $2 50 and
we give about once a month first class
boxing contests, charging $1 for admis
sion. Many men in town who joined tha
club for the express purpose of seeing
these exhibitions quit their membership,
preferring to pay a dollar for each en
tertainment. In future it is very prob
able that we may limit these contests
entirely to club members."
The Acme Club has run in arrears on
its lease $2400. Abrahamson Brothers,
the lessors, after putting on an attach
ment, reduced the amount of the arrears
to $1600 on condition that this sum should
be paid at once, and on the same condi
tion they also reduced the rent from $175
to $125 per month. The Acme members,
however, who have carried along their
club so many years in the face of great
difficulties, decided that It would be use
less to prolong their agony, and that tha
most practical and feasible thing to do
would be to join the Reliance Club.
A committee from each of the clubs
was appointed and met this evening, in-
President Fitzgerald's office. The Acme
members who intend to join the Reliance
requested that one or two of their in
structors who had been with the club
many years should be taken care of by
the Reliance. Some of these instructors
could have secured employment at the
Reliance Club any time they wished, so
this request was adjusted without diffi
culty. President Fitzgerald admitted that
the records of the Acme Club, from a
purely athletic standpoint, were some
what superior to those of the Reliance,
and said that with a couple of hundred
of the best members of the Acme added
to the Reliance it would guarantee athletic
and financial success in its management
and would relieve the club from the con
tinual efforts that are necessary to main
tain its present high standing.
lt is expected that many of the Acme
members will go to West Oakland. Many
of these Acme boys live in that end of
town, and as the new club has just in
corporated it will doubtless receive quite
a boom by the going of the Acme.
At the meeting to-night of the Acme
and Reliance committees it was decided
that the Reliance should engage Boxing
Instructor Kitchen and Wrestling In
structor Paul Carroll of the Acme.
Obnoxious Loading Law.
PASADENA, Oct. President J. H.
Woodworth of the Pasadena Orange-
Growers' Association to-day received a.re
ply from Manager Edward Chambers of
the Santa Fe freight department at San
Francisco to the complaint of the growers
against the loading edict taking effect No
vember 15. The minimum carload will be
26,000 pounds. The cars used will be 40 and
36 foot cars. This maKes a hardship for
buyers and shippers because oftentimes
buyers want small lots that cannot now
be furnished. They must take large lots
or nothing. Woodworth says he will have
to grin and bear it.

I. NEW WORDS AND HOW TO USB
THEM.
Keep a, common writing pad on your
desk. When you hear a new word which
interests you or when you come aoross
one in your reading jot it down. Take
time to look up Its meaning. Frame sen
tences In which this word is used cor
rectly. Incorporate it into your own vo
cabulary by using it in your conversation
â¦lie very first chance you get, not in un
affected way, but as part of your every
day '"*.â¢;. You must learn to distinguish
between words suitable for conversation
and words which are better adapted to
the printed page. Conversational speech
has soul and feeling. Written speech
may be technical, scientific, exact; the
meaning being conveyed wholly by the
words, while In conversation tho meaning
Is conveyed in part by the gesture, the
voice and the personality of the speaker.
Take the following twelve words for your
first lesson and add a dozen more of your
own choosing during the week:
Resumeâ This is a French word which
has come into common use. It is pro
nounced ray-zsu-may, with accent upon
first and last syllables. It means a sum
mary, a- summing up, a condensed ac
count. We may say that a particular
magazine or paper gives a good resume of
current events.
Connoisseur â Pronounced con-1-seur,
with the accent upon the last syllable. A
connoisseur is a critical judge, or rather a
person who is competent to pass critical
judgment upon anything. The word is
most commonly used in speaking of a per
son thoroughly competent to pass judg
ment upou the worK of Borne particular
department of art. A man who is mak
ing a specialty of collecting rare water
colors aud who Is considered from long
experience competent to pass upon a pic
ture offered is said to be a connnoisseur In
water colors.
Altruisticâ This word is now very com- !
monly used. The noun is altruism. It is
opposed to selfishness. Any movement
having for its :hiel end the good of others
may be termed altruistic. Note this word i
In your newspaper and magazine reading.
You are sure to meet it.
.Ghettoâ The name Ghetto is given to the
ifert of a city or town formerly set apart
tor the Jews, aa In Rome or Frankfort- '
on-the- Rhine. At present this name is a
synonym for "Jewish quarter."
Radicalâ Measures are radical when they
are extreme or directly opposed to conven
tional or commonplace methods. A man
is radical when he is the opposite of con- :
servative ln his ideas and methods In po- j
lltical, religious and social affairs. Ihe .
radical breaks away from ail traditions i
and established customs.
Salonâ Pronounced sab-long, with the j
second syllable accented. An apartment ,
in which a company Is to receive; hence,
a fashionable reception or gathering. The :
name salon is specifically applied to peri
odic social reunions in Paris. The name is
also applied to the annual exhibition ln
Paris of works of living artists.
Bohemianâ A person, especially an ar- ,
tlst or literary' man, who leads a free '
life, having little regard to what society |
he frequents and despising the Â»nven
tional. One who prefers adventure and i
speculation to settled industry and who
does not work well ht the harness of or- j
dinary life. This word is pretty -rally !
used in America as the opposite of con
ventional. The bohemian's dress and hab

THE MINISTER'S COFFEE.
Hurt Him Worse Than the Devil Did.
"I used the old-fashioned coffee from
my babyhood, and like many others
thought I could not live without it.
Was In the army four years during the
Rebellion and came out very much
broken In health. I was compelled to
quit the active work of the ministry
for more than a year at a time, suf-
fering terribly from stomach and In-
testinal troubles and ton liver, with
the consequent nervous headache and
prostration, lumbago and rheumatism.
"Four years ago. being confined to
bed with these troubles and ulceration
of the liver, my physician positively
forbade the use of coffee and brought
me some Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
Since that time myself and family have
used no ther coffee. All my Intestinal
trouble has been greatly relieved, and
I no longer suffer from rheumatism
and very little from torpid liver or bil-
iousness.
"I am fully convinced that coffee is
very largely responsible for the greater
part of all stomach, intestinal and livei-
troubles from which people suffer. I
am now 58 years old, and my health
has been so much improved that I do
aa much work as I ever did, and with
about as much comfort. I can con-
scientiously 'attribute it chiefly to the
use of Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
There are several friends who have had
valuable experience with the leaving
off of coffee and the use of Postum
Food Coffee. It gives me pleasure to
add mv testitmony to help humanity
to understand that the very general
cause of sickness Is, 1 consider, largely
attributable to mistakes In the use of
food and drink." Rev. J. A. Flickinger.

ness of whose character impresses one im
mediately. A man of strong personality
is a man with strong and effective power
of will.
Bourgeoisâ Pronounced boor-zhwah. This
Word is commonly used in the sense
of unrefined or uncultured. In France the
name bourgeoisie, pronounced boor
ehwah-rt, is used to designate the middle
or artisan class, as distinguished from the
aristocracy.
Stiltedâ Elevated and stiff as If on stilts;
hence the word is used in the sense of me
chanical or unnatural; as, a stilted walk;
a stilted letter; a stilted style; a stilted
speech.
Diplomacyâ The art and practice of con
ducting negotiations between nations. The
name is applied generally in the sense of
tact, or of dexterity and skill in the man
agement of men. We say that a man is
diplomatic when he exercises keen Judg
ment and a cautious policy in securing the
co-operation of other men. The word pol
itic is very similar In meaning, but refers
more to careful personal relations.
Renaissanceâ Pronounced ren-nay-sahns.
This word means a new birth, a revival or
resurrection, and is applied specially to
the period of awakening in arts and let
ters during the last centuries of the dark
ages. The renaissance began in Italy in
the fourteenth century and spread gradu
ally over Western Europe. The name is
applied also to the art and architecture
which belonged to that period of history,
as: "The renaissance style of building
and decoration succeeded the Gothic and
sought to reproduce the forms of classical
ornamentation."
This series will be continued next week.
Let us turn now to a few suggestions and
cautions which will aid us in our written
speech.
When we speak of pure air, pure water
or pure gold we mean air, gold or water
that has been cleared of all extraneous
matter. Similarly, when we speak if pure
language we mean language that has been
cleared of all extraneous words and
phrases. The dross of language consists
of vulgarisms, words and phrases that
should be avoided even in conversation
such as "kid" for child, "kick the buck
et," "you bet," etc.; colloquialisms, words
and phrases admissible in conversation,
but not suitable for written composition,
such as "jiffy" for instant, "sat upon" for
censured, etc. Colloquialisms when used
at the proper time and place may give
force and zest to conversation. A collo
quialism which may be quite proper in the
speech of one person may be wholly out of
place in the speech of another: provincial
isms, words confined to some particular
province or locality; obsolete words; for
eign words which have not been incorpor
ated into our language; newly coined
words. We must not rid our speech of all
its spice and ginger and snap, but it must
be remembered that these qualities cannot
be introduced by words merely. Language
is simply the wire which carries the mes-
sage.
Propriety of language means the using
of words (1) in their proper senses, (2) in
proper connections. Any sense or connec
tion of words may be considered proper
that has the concurrent authority of stan
dard writers who have lived near enough
to our own time to be regarded as safe
guides for present usage. We shall take
up for our lesson next week a few com
mon Improprieties of speech.
as to make a block _ Inches square and 4
Inches thick it ls still a board foot. To
find the solid contents of such a block we
multiply the length and breadth and
thickness together, that ls 6x6x4, which
gives us 144. The student will note, then.
that a foot of lumber is 144 cubic inches
of lumber, no matter what shape the
wood may be.
In the following exercises only flat sur

HINTS AND ANSWERS.
Lesson No. 1. (1) 4 feet.^The board is !
96 inches by 8 inches, %X6-r-144=4. (2) j
$71 60. The area of the whole floor is 1512 i
square feet and the area of the elevator ;
space is 80 square feet. There are there
fore 1432 feet to be covered and each
square foot represents a board foot. (3)
18 feet. (4) 19,800 feet. (5) 4524 square
inches. (6) 12 feet. A square yard con- t
tains nine times 144, or 1296 square inches.
This divided by 18 inches (the breadth)
gives 72 inches (the length). If 6 feet are |
cut off, 32 feet will remain. (7) 4536 feet.
The platform in a straight line would be
I 252 feet long by IS feet wide. (8) $60. (9) .
3 feet. It is necessary to cut off 648 square :
Inches (4^ square feet). A surface 86
Inches long by 18 inches wide equals 648
square inches. (10) $11 70.

Vessels going to Cape Nome with pas
sengers and general merchandise have a
hard time of it. Many of the smaller
craft drag their anchors and go ashore,
while nearly a third of the merchandise
is lost by the capsizing of the lighters.
Some of the boats that go ashore get
off, but quite a few have left their bones
to bleach on "the golden shore."
E. "Manny" Fogel has Just returned
from a trip to Kotzebue Sound, Golovin
Bay and Cape Nome. Yesterday he was
telling his friends on the front what he
thought of the different districts.
"Kotzebue is a good place to stay away
from," he said. "Golovin Bay is all right,
but it is not a poor man's diggings.
However, at Cape Nome there is gold for
everybody. When I left there the min
ers were washing from $20 to $50 a day
out of the sand of the beach.
"It is a terrible place to land at, how
ever. There is a gravel beach and no
holding ground. In consequence the ves
sels have to stand on and off and land
their passengers and cargo in lighters.
Sometimes the steamer is driven off and
then it occasionally takes her a week to
get back again. Barges going ashore
with provisions are caught in the break
ers and rolled over, and that is the end
of the merchandise. I think I am safe
in saying that a third of the goods that
are sent to Cape Nome are lost by the
' capsizing of lighters.
"The old pilot-boat Caleb Curtis Is a
total wreck. She dragged her anchor,
went ashore among the gold hunters and
was lost. The schooners George Swan,
; R. Eckert and Lady George laid their
bones on 'the golden shore,' while
j the steamer Elk went ashore but
i got off. The steamer Joe Matthews
' was not so successful. She went
! a.shore and nothing but her machin
j cry was saved. The EI Primoro followed
j the Joe Matthews on the beach and
\ her owners thought so little of the chances
: of getting her off that they sold her as
j she lay for $100 to Jim Kennedy, who was
first mate of the steamer Bertha not long
i ago. Kennedy gave George Brown a half
' interest ln the steamer to get her off.
and before 1 left Nome they started for
'. the Siberian coast after a load of rein-
I deer. Kennedy and Brown will get rich
j out of that Investment of $100." Fogel
I brought down quite a sack of gold with
him from the mines and is going back
! to Anvil City in the spring.
! The cruiser Newark came down from
Mare Island yesterday afternoon and will
, sail for Manila via Honolulu and Guam,
early this morning. The postoffice offi
i cials put about ten tons of mail matter
aboard her. Nearly all of It is for the
. Philippines and Guam. Twenty tons of
fresh provisions were also taken aboard
the cruiser, so the crew will not suffer for
want of delicacies during the run to Ma
nila.
The transport Centennial arrived from
! Honolulu yesterday and will be got ready
I to take away another load of horses at
'â  once. She brought up First Lieutenant
! W. D. Strong of the Thirty-third In-
I fantry, six soldiers and seven civilians.
Lieutenant Strong was taken sick at
| Honolulu and was Invalided home. The
I soldiers are time-expired men and the
'civilians were In the employ of the Gov
: ernment at Honolulu.
The barkentlne City of Papeete arrived
from Tahiti yesterday. She brought up
' a large cargo of cocoanuts and copra, be
; sides the following passengers: Captain
I D. Dexter. Miss Pauline Droilet. W. Bry
' ant, G. Ross. M. McCarthy. Charles Olsen
j and five natives. Captain Dexter and all
] the male passengers, Including the na
tives, have come here to take the new
schooner built by Matthew Turner back
to Tahiti. Captain Berude of the City
of Papeete is accompanied by his wife
and Miss Droilet comes to San Francisco
on a visit, as their guest.
Reinsurance on the American ship
Charles E. Moody jumped to 50 per cent
yesterday. She Is now out IS3 days from
Norfolk, Va., for Honolulu, with a cargo
of coal. The general impression among
â¢ shipping men is that she has gone to Ha
â  waii via the Cape of Good Hope. The
British ship Queen Victoria, on which 15
per cent reinsurance was paid, arrived at
Port Townsend yesterday and it now
transpires that the St. Enoch, which is
overdue here from Panama, and on which
15 per cent reinsurance has been paid,
was spoken when fifty-three days out, in
Panama Bay. She was In the doldrums
and was making no headway. The St.
Enoch, therefore, cannot be considered
overdue.
The steamer North Fork has been laid
up to have her boilers repaired and the
steamer Luella will go out on her run
next Saturday. The North Fork will not
be ready for sea again for over a week.
The delegation from lowa, to greet the

SAILOR KITS MOT TO
BE HELD FOR DEBT
BOARDING-HOUSE KEEPER TO
BE MULCTED.
William Hermann Will Be Obliged
to Pay One Hundred Dollars for
Violating the Maguire Act.
Up to the decision of United States Dis- j
trict Judge Hanford of the State of !
Washington about two months ago, sail- j
ors whose kits had been retained by i
boarding-house keepers or others because i
of debt or for any other reason, had but. 1
little difficulty in recovering their prop
erty under the provision of the Maguire
act. The procedure in such cases was |
i the filing of a criminal complaint and the '
I arrest of the boarding-house keeper.
i When brought before the United States :
! Court Commissioner the defendants in al
! most every case settled the matter by
; surrendering the. clothing or other per
sonal property that had been withheld.
Judge Hanford's decision was to the
effect that criminal proceedings could not
be taken legally under the Maguire act, ,
I and that the proper procedure was tc i
bring, in the name of the United States,
a civil suit in the United States -District
i Court against the boarding-house keeper i
1 or other defendant for the collection of j
the $100 penalty provided for the act. â  ' j
Assistant United States District At- ]
i torney Banning was applied to a few!
> days ago by Francis Manger, a sailor,
'. who complained that William H. Her- '
: mann, the keeper of a sailor boarding- !
house on Steuart street, had retained tils i
sea-going clothing under the plea that 1
â  Mauger owed him for board and lodging, ;
and refused to give up the property.
Mr. Banning notified Hermann that he ]
i was acting in violation or law. and ad
vised him to return. the clothing to Mau
ger, but Hermann refused to .follow the
advice. Mr. Banning thereupon filed a
complaint* in civil process against Her
, mann to recover $100 penalty and costs. I
Half of the penalty goes to the Informer,
| who, in this case, is the sailor. The other j
half and the costs go to the Government. '<
I United States District Attorney Coombs !
will press the suit vigorously for the pro-
I tectlon of sailors, for whose benefit the
Maguire act was passed by Congress.

of the closing of the Convalescent Home
1 and how it has since been used as a read

| place for officers and their families, en
| route to the Philippines. She stated that
; 139 patients had been treated at the hos
i pital; that in August last the Red Cross
I Society offered to reopen the home, but
| the Government officials thankfully de
clined the offer, stating that the Govern
| ment was now able to handle the sick and
j Wounded without outside assistance.
C. M. Waage, one of the nurses who
went to the Philippines with the First
California Regiment, detailed at length
his experiences In that distant country.
He also eulogized the splendid work per

\ "Dear Mrs. Pinkhamâ About two years ago I began to j&
l^v run down and soon became almost a wreck. I lost my appe- W
0 tite and began to lose flesh; my blood was impoverished and tf
0 I had to leave our store. The doctor gave me a little tonic, JL
\| but I steadily grew worse and consulted another doctor. He
yT helped me in some ways, but my -headaches continued, and I W
tf began to have night sweats and my rest was so disturbed that 4^
id I would have hysteria and would cry and worry over business
jÂ± matters and my poor health. Finally, husband took me South, %T
W but with no benefit. This was a year ago ; no one can ever 0^
v know what a winter of misery T' spent. Would bloat after db
j& eating and was troubled with palpitation of heart and whites. Ji
V Having read by happy chance of your medicine, I bought it

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â There was a short
lived demonstration by the bulls in the Stock
Market to-day, but before trading was sus
pended the early gains were largely cur
tailed and in some cases more than wiped out.
The strength was attributed to various
causes. The reappearance this week upon the
floor of the exchange of several operators who
took a large part in last spring's big bull
market, and who have been away on long
summer vacations, gave something of a fillip
to bullish sentiment. The quiet tone of the
money market yesterday In the face of oper
ations Incident to the change of old Central
racific becurities for new encouraged some
sentiment for a rise. There were one or two
stocks in the list which were notably strong
from Individual causes which were rumored
but not authoritatively disclosed, and which
helped to sustain prices. Among these were
Pullman arid Great Northern .-:-â¢'- i ed, al
though the latter more than lost the early
gains. The Baltimore and Ohio stocks were
conspicuously Strong, the common rising an
extreme 2% and the preferred -. Laclede Gas
continued Its advance and readied as high as
80. The Grangers, Louisville .Southern Pa
cific were quite well taken early in the day,
apparently by public interests. The public was
not In evidence at any time during tha day.
Call muney continued at 6 per cent or below
In spite of the fact that many banks report
their cash still below the legal reserve. But
while the money rate did not tighten, a num
ber of industrial stocks, especially those
classed as "Green" in Wall-street parlance,
showed signs of weakness as might happen if
they were subjugated to discrimination by mon
ey lenders in the shifting of loans. The glucose
stocks were notably affected, the common drop
ping nearly 8 points ar.d sing near the low
est, while the preferred lost 3%.
The Iron and steel stocks as a group also
weakened simultaneously. Steel and Wire lead
ing with an extreme decline of 2%. Others
of the group Buffered to the extent of between
1 and 2 points. This unsettled the bull move
ment and wiped out pretty much all the gains
which had been established. Prices struggled
upward In the final dealings to a level lor the
most part slightly above last night, but the
sap was taken out of the movement. There
was a warning rally in the rates for foreign
exchange during the day which was unheeded.
Signals of distress were In evidence ln the
German money markets and sterling exchange
fel! sharp at the Continental centers. Includ
ing Paris. Discount rates in London responded
with an advance and exchange rates here, both
on Paris and London, rose* in sympathy. Added
to this the fact that money is still going to
the Interior in considerable volume, and that
Government payments through the sub-treas
ury are again falling off, promising a re
newed drain on the money market on account
of revenue receipts and that applications 'for
anticipated payments for Government Interest
continue on a small scale, and the outlook for
easier money ls not promising. This consid
eration was sufficient to give pause to the
efforts to advance prices.
The bond market was moderately active and
prices Improved. Total sales, par value.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Oct. 17â A decline of l%d at Liv- j
erpool and favorable crop reports put wheat
traders in a bearish temper at the opening. |
High ocean rates were against the mar- I
ket, and the longs began to unload at the out- j
set. There was not a great deal of short sell- |
' ing, however, as the break has been etch for j
S the last few days that trade was rather cau
tious, but liquidation to stop further losses was |
I generous and the market soon got below puts. .
I December opened %ffi%c lower at 70%@71c, sold :
! sparingly at 71c and declined to 70%Â®70%c. It \
i recovered to 70% con covering by shorts, settled
I a small fraction and then for an hour held at j
j about 70% c, with business during that time al- |
most at a standstill. During the latter part of j
! the session there was a slight recovery in price i
on covering induced by heavy clearances and a
report that India had commenced Importing .
1 wheat. The advance did not hold, however,
! as an Increase of 6,656,000 bushels In the world's |
; visible supply since a week ago started renew- j
ied liquidation, under which December de
! clined to 70% c. The close was at 70% ;---,
Corn ruled dull and weak. The wheat break !
! had some Influence and a break of %d at
Liverpool was also an important factor.
Elevator Interests and longs sold and the mar
ket got under puts, closing at the bottom. De
cember closed at 30% c.
| Oatt, were weak under active selling by longs
and in sympathy with the decline in wheat and
corn. There was a fair cash demand. Decem
ber closed at 22%Â®22%c.
Provisions were weak early owing to large re
ceipts cl hogs and lower prices at the yards,
but the loss was recovered near the close on
buying by packers. January Pork closed 2%c
lower. January Lard unchanged and January

year;' disengaged, 2013 tons, against 47,900: on
the way to this port, 204,190 tons, against
155,400.
WHEATâ The 'market has relapsed Into a
very unsatisfactory condition. Liverpool de
clined %. The foreigners showed Indications
Of having bought too freely and are now dis
posed to sell. Advancing freights, declining
cables and Increasing stocks make a discour
aging situation. Chicago reports a very weak
market on liquidation, with the demand chiefly
to fill shorts. Wall street again bought mod
erately, but the principal demand was against
puts. Broomhall cabled that India was buying
frcm Australia direct.
Futures declined, but the spot market was

MRS. ROCKHILL
HIDES TO AVOID
THE SHERIFF
Will Not Testify at
Husband's Trial.
- â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9"S Broadway, Oct. 17.
A remarkable set of circumstances
has been developed in the affairs of
Edward Rockhill and the woman who Is
presumed to be his wife.
The Rockhills have resided in North
Oakland for several ears, and Rock
hill until several weeks ago was em
ployed as a heater at the J udson Iron
Works. One Sunday morning last Au

tion, during which the woman [aimed
Rockhill had stabbed her in the breast.
Later on the samo day he combat was
renewed in a barn on the premises and
she tired a shotgun at him, part of the
charge lodging in his left shoulder.
Rockhill was arrested, examined an i
held to answes before the Superior Court
on a charge oT attempt to murder.
Th.c case was called for trial to-day in
Judge Hall's court, when Deputy District
Attorney Melvin announced that it had
been impossible for the Sheriff to serve
a subpena on the complaining witness,
Mrs. Theresa Rockhill. The prosecutor
expressed the belief that the woman iii.
not wish to testify against her husband
and was therefore purposely secreting
herself.
Judge Hall noted the fact that Mrs.
Rockhill had visited the prisoner at the
County Jail only last Wednesday, tha
very day the subpena had been issued,
whereas tho information had been tiled
on tho 3d inst. "Where a wife is ex
pected to testify against her husband,"
said the court, "there should be no delay
in securing her attendance. The officers
knew she did not desire to testify against
him in this case and had plenty of time
to get her here." Against the protest of
RockhiU's attorney, Asa V. Mendenhall,
the trial was continued until Friday to
give the officers another chance to serve
the subpena.
Now comes the startling information
from the East that the woman is not
RockhiU's wife. The local authorities
have received letters from RockhiU's for

that they were never married; that the
children "at RockhiU's home are by a

GEN. FUNSTON TALKS
OF THE PHILIPPINES
OAKLAND, Oct. 17.â General Funston !
of the Kansas regiment delivered a short j
address to-night at a well-attended meet
ing held under the auspices of the Men's
League at the Fnlon-street Presbyterian
Church; He spoke purely about the re- j
sources of the Philippines ancl declared
the new possessions worth many times j
over the $20 000,000 this Government paid
for them.. On the Island of Palawan; the
asserted, there is timber alone worth $150,- j
000,000, and on the inland of Mindanao j
endless riches in teak, ebony and mahog- ;
any, vast forests of wealth.
"The Philippines," said General Fun- .
ston. "contain the greatest body of un
developed wealth of the world." The â¢
"inherent cussedness of Spanish rule" he
ascribed as the cause that has retarded
ail growth and development of what he
termed "the biggest klondike any nation
ever had.'.'
He spoke of the production of hemp and I
the valuable fiber of the banana plant
that could be grown nowhere else, and
gave many interesting statistics.
To the population, which has been vari
ously estimated at between 5,0u0,000 and
10.000.000, he said might be added the many j
who compose the savage tribes that have .
not yet been heard from. Incidentally i
the speaker refuted the statement made i
by an agent of the St. Andrew's Society
of Albany to the effect hat our army
in the Philippines was composed of 45.- |
000 rakes, gamblers and good-for-noth- :
ings, and he branded him as a liar, grace
fully excusing himself for the use -or such !
a term by declaring it to be the only j
language applicable. Referring to the ;
American press, General Funston said
that the accounts of the military phase j
of the war were very fair and correct. '

SNOW'S LETTER
CRITICIZED BY
A COUNCILMAN
Mayor May Return
Eight Thousand.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 17.
Since the exclusive publication in The
Call a month ngo of the fact that Mayor
Snow when Auditor retained commissions
amounting to several thousand dollars, to
which he believed he was entitled, many
members of the city government have
been making inquiry with a view to see
ing if the Mayor cannot be compelled to
return these commissions.
With the division in the City Council
the opportunity to make capita] out of the
situation was not to be lost, and now
I 'resident Rowe. for a purpose which he
lias not vet divulged, but which is known
to be the bring-' of the matter formally
before the Council, has verilied The Call's
statements and has found that the
amount exceeds JSOOO altogether.
When the .. res were published the
Mayor referred to a letter sent to the
Council in 1835, in which he called that
body's attention to the fact that he in
tended to take advantage of the statute
giving him the right to retain 6 per cent
on all personal property tax collected.
The Mayer's contention -,' as and is hat
the Auditor, being held personally respon
sible for the collection of all personal
property taxes, he should make prepara
tion for possible lawsuits, which the new
system would undoubtedly bring about.
A member of the Council, after read
ing the Mayor's letter, which was pub
lished in The Call, said that accord to
the contents of the Mayor's official ex
planation, he should have returned the
money to the treasury on January 1 of
this year.
"If I read the Mayor's letter aright,"
saici the Councilman, "he says that in
1596 he Intended to retain these commis
sions because of the extra duties imposed
upon him by the statute which took ef
fect that year, 1896. In another portion
of the letter he Bays that it is his inten
tion to retain these commissions until
such time as a new statute shall relieve
the Auditor of these special responsibili
ties. According to another published In
terview with the Mayor, he says that the
present Auditor has no authority to with
hold these commissions, because the new
statute went into effect this year. There
fore, 1 contend that on January 1 the
Mayor, according to his own showing,
should have returned the money.
"There Is still another point in the j
Mayor's explanation which has surprised j
many members of the Council. He says i
thatâ writing in IS96â he intends 'this j
year' to retain such commission, and
says nothing about any previous years. |
Yet on looking at the Auditor's reports
for the last ten years. I find that in 1896, \
without any other authority than this lit- j
ter to the Council, he goes back seven
years and arbitrarily withholds from the ;
personal property taxes of 1896 all the
commissions he thought himself entitled
to for the previous seven years. While '
I do not believe for a moment but what
Mr. Snow thought he was legally entitled
to these commissions, still there are
many of us who think otherwise, and it
is our duty to at least make an effort to
discover whether this large sum. amount-
Ing to $SSOO, belongs to the Auditor or is ;
recoverable by the city."
The Ma; I says that all this talk about
the commissions is the work of politicians.
He declares there can be no contention
about his right to these commissions 'and |
he will welcome a legal settlement of the j
question, although he says he hardly \
thinks his political enemies will give him
this much satisfaction.

A MERRY COMEDY AT
ALCAZAR THIS WEEK
There Is no denying the fact that some |
of the members of the Alcazar Stock
Company are very versatile, and among
them all C. F. Montalne is entitled to
first mors. A man who can play one
week the Baron Hartfeld in "Jim the
Penman" with thai subtlety and strength
of execution which marked Mr. Mon
taine's performance of this difficult char
acter, an.l the next week be equal!) suc
cessful as Jose] Poulard in "The
Masked Ball," Is an artist. The former
i.s the characterization of an aristocratic
swindler, whose Impudence Is so great
that it becomes humorous at times, while j
the latter is a poor fellow over whom a
storm la continually breaking In the,
shape of a wife's wrath. On requires
all the dramatic temperament of a drama
tist, while the other necessitates a keen
judgment of comic situations. Mr. Mon
taine, having been very successful in the i
portrayal of both parts, is deserving of i
much praise for great versatility.
Another actor of many resources is Eu
gene Ormonde, who changed the strong
character part of the detective in "Jim
the Penman" for the juvenile role of Dr.
Paul Blondet in "The Masked Ball." I
While the former character is endowed !
with a good deal of an adopted phleg
matic disposition, which is really laugh
able, and accompanied by certain exhi
bitions of occasional cleverness, the lat
ter is the Impersonation of a husband
very much in love with his wife and very
much excited over a plot instigated by
his wife against him as a punishment for
a certain fib he was guilty of. As Mr.
Ormonde was In both parts simply ad- i
mirable, the reputation of an actor par j
excellence cannot be denied him.
Gertrude Foster is this time playing a I
somewhat Jolly roleâ that of a soubrette, j
as it were. She has a drinking scene,
where she does some legitimate acting.
In order to appreciate this scene fully It!
must be remembered that the tipsync-ss is :
only put on. And in this very fact Miss i
Foster is successful, for it is easy to ob
serve that she acts her part, and one is j
surprised that the husband is not aware
of the Joke. He evidently is so excited i
that he cannot see the plot against him.
The stage management Is, as usual, flaw- i
less. ALFRED METZGER.

went out to her, but were unable to ex
tinguish the lire with their small hose.

Before this could be attempted the
flames had gained such headway that
tugs gave up trying to get hold of her.

CITY TRUSTEES
Officials Threaten to
Bring Actions.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 17.â The meeting of the j
Board of Trustees of this city to-night
proved a lively one. Trustee Mackie j
created a sensation by criticizing the City
Clerk, and there was also a warm fight
over the election of George Macrea to a -
position on the local police force. At the
outset of the meeting Trustee Shulte j
voiced his objection to Macrea. He said i
the latter had received but three votes, j
He desired to know whether Chairman
Brick had cast the deciding vote, and
having received an answer in the nega- j
tive moved for a reconsideration of the
election, but there being no second the ]
motion was not entertained. A. V. Fisher I
appeared before the board and asked j
what action had been taken on his claim \
for $75, salary as collector for the month j
of July. President Brick Informed him i
that the board had decided to take no J
action whatever, that it was the desire of i
the Trustees to ha-, the matter tested in j
the courts. Trustee Miller moved to have
the board fix the salary to be paid the;
DeDUty City Clerk. Mr. Miller moved
that the deputy's salary be fixed at $5- a
month. Objection being offered, Mr. Mil
ler desired to know what the opinion of
the Finance Committee was in the mat
ter. Mr. Mackie replied that the com
mittee had reported two weeks ago that
DETROIT'S GUNS WERE
TRAINED ON VENEZUELA
American Warships Prevented a
Bombardment of the Town of
Puerto Cabello.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â President An
drade of Venezuela was on board the
Red Line steamship Philadelphia, which
arrived from Puerto Cabello and La
Guayra this morning. The offcers of the
vessel, however, had some stories to tell
about the rebellion in the South Ameri
can Republic. When the Philadelphia
was in the harbor of Puerto Cabello on
October 4 and 5 the rebels swarmed over
the hills back of the town and took pos
session of it. The fort was hold by the
Government troops, who threatened to
tire on the town to drive out the rebels.
The cruiser Detroit was lying in the
harbor close to the American consulate
and the Consul forbade the bombardment
of the town. ---.;> --
"If you open fire on the town I shall
proceed to shell your works,'' was the
message he sent to the commandant, ac
cording to the officers of the Philadelphia.
In order to emphasize the message the
guns of the Detroit were trained on the
Venezuelan fortification. That night an
envoy from President Andrade was sent
from Caracas to Puerto Cabello. where he
had a conference with General Castro.
There was a story at Puerto Cabello
that President Andrade had offered to
leave Venezuela if permitted to sell all
the property he held and take the pro
ceeds out of the country with him. Castro
would not agree to these terms. Chief
Officer M. M. Crockett of the Philadel
phia says the insurrection is holding up
thousands of bags of coffee, which can
not be transported to the seashore and
all ships are leaving port light.

Rush at the Sugar Factory.
SALINAS. Oct. 17.â Some idea of the
rush at the Spreckels sugar factory may
be gained from the knowledge that sev
eral extra freight trains have been com
ing and going daily over the Southern
Pacific tracks for some weeks past. Yes
terday an extra with twelve heavily beet
laden gondola cars arrived in the fore
noon. There were some 360 tons of beets
on the cars, and this is only a small por
tion of the daily receipts. Then the
northbound extra freight takes away
dally from six to seven carloads of sugar
to the refinery At San Francisco. This
output will average about 150 tons daily.

The purpose of the gathering is to
consider and put into action plans for
encouraging the wage-earners to do
all their trading at home and to Insure
the employment of organized labor by
merchants.
in Its judgment the City Clerk did not
need a deputy.
"1 told the City Clerk," said Mr.
Mackie. "when this matter was up be
fore, that I had figures as to the time he
had been spending In the office, and I ad
vised him to let the question rest. Now
it is brought up again and 1 am taken by
surprise. 1 have those figures at home,
not here. 1 have too much regard for the
City Clerk and for his deputy to want to
be forced to fix a nominal salary for the
deputy, but I do oppose placing a pre
â  mium on an official going outside his office
and earning an additional stipend."
Mr. Miller stated that he had brought the
question up to avoid a lawsuit. "I think
a suit the best," replied Mr. Mackie. "We
want it determined whether 'we have
power as Trustees to run municipal af
fairs. The office-holders seem to be over
riding us. If we have no power I want
to know it and I shall then be in favor
of stepping out, as I have felt like doing
several times already.''
Mr. Shulte moved as an amendment to
the original motion that the salary of the
'. deputy clerk be fixed at $5, and Mr.
Mackie seconded It. The amendment was
carried by the votes of Messrs. Brick,
Mackie and Shulte. Mr. Miller and Mr.
: Forderer voted against the amendment.
j Suit will be brought against the Trustees
j by Deputy Clerk Fletter for three months'
. salary at the rate of $75 per month. A.
V. Fisher will commence suit for the re
i covery of the $75 due him. In both cases
the City Attorney advised the board that
the claims were legal.
Mr. Miller spoke in favor of having
I bonds voted to the amount of $30,000 for

a few hours later groaning by the road

Dr. Jordan has just received word that a
valuable collection of New Zealand fishes
has been presented to the Stanford mu

from so remote a source. Only one other
donation was made to an American insti
tution, and that was to the National Mu
seum at Washington. D. C.

WEST STREET
OPENING WILL
BE EXPENSIVE
Plan Completed for a
Big Scheme.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
93S Broadway, Oct. 17.
The plan for the opening of West
street was completed to-day by the City
Engineer, and it contains enough evi
dence to show that there will be a bitter
contest before this boulevard is openecl
from Twenty-second to Twenty-sixth
streets.
This project originated with Council
man Girard, and has received all pos
sible support up to this point. The Coun
cil readily acknowledged the value of cut
ting this broad thoroughfare clear
through, from the- water front to iho
Berkeley line.
The plan shows that lt will be neces
sary to take several large pieces of land
on which are built many houses of
medium value. The line cuts completely
through eight structures and takes in lhe
land on which are about a dozen more.
The lines run through the land from
Sycamore te Twenty-sixth street, requir
ing 198 feet on one side and 200 feet on the
other. A little corner,- 7 by 14 feet, Is
taken off the corner of the east side of
San Pablo avenue and Twenty-fifth street.
On the opposite side a corner 4â¬ by 39 feet
is cut off Isabella street. South of Isa
bella street 425 feet is required to meet
the existing northerly boundary of West
street. The lines are so run that they
are perfectly straight from the boundaries
of west street south of Twenty-second
to the boundaries of West street north of
Twenty-sixth widening out three feet, as
the southern portion of the street is
77 feet wide while north of Twenty-sixth
is 80 feet wide.
The assessment district Is marked off
from Fifth to Forty-seventh streets, and
embraces one entire block on each side
of West street. This throws the assess
ment on eighty-four blocks of property.
The necessary resolution of intention will
be presented to the Council at its next
meeting.

GOAT'S MEAT
SUBSTITUTED
TOO MUTTON
Fed to County Hos
pital Inmates.
â  â¦ â
CONTRACTORS ARE ACCUSED
â¦
_
STARTLING DISCOVERY BY IN
SPECTOR WTTZEMANN.
Â«
Eoard of Health Will Take Action
Against Hoffmann & Wonne,
Who Supplied the Con
demned Meat.
The startling discovery was made yes
terday morning by Chief Market In- ]
spector N. F. Witzemann that the in- '
mates of the City and County Hospital :
Were being fed on goat's flesh instead of I
mutton, as the result of the substitution
by the firm of Hoffmann & Woenne, who '
have the contract for furnishing the in- '
stitution with mutton.
Witzemann has been recently appointed
and has proved himself very energetic
In the performance of his duties, and with
that end in view went out to the hospital
to Inspect the meat. As he was passing i
through the kitchen he detected a pc- i
culiar odor and asked the cook what it i
was. The latter replied that it was mut- I
ton. Two legs were cooking in the pan j
nnd hanging close by was another leg
and a side, which Inspector Wltxemann
immediately confiscated, having first as-
BurÂ«-d himself that it was goat's meat In
stead of mutton. Witzemann is of the
opinion that the substitution has been go- :
ing on for a long time and that the con- \
tractors are liable on their bonds.
Witzemann came into town with the j
condemned goat meat and Stopped at the
â¢tore of Hoffmann & Woenne, on Market
Street near Third, and showed Hoffman ,
the meat. He said.
"What do you think of that meat?"
Hoffmann, who of course did not recog
nize tho meat In its dressed condition
os that which he had supplied, but recog
nizing the fact that it was goat's meat.
said;
"Well, the man who did that ought to !
be hoi hipped."
"Well." said Witzemann, "you're that '.
man. for that is the meat you have been ;
furnishing the City and County Hospital '
for mutton."
Hoffmann realized that he was cleverly S
caught, and blurted out:
"I do not know whether it is mutton
or goat. But even if it is goat, ain't it
wholesome?"
Witzemann did not discuss the tier
any further, but reported it to Health
Officer Lawler, who will bring it up at
the next meeting of the board, when some j
action will undoubtedly be taken.
VERDICT OF ACCIDENT
IN THE MEYER CASE
INSULATION WORN OFF THE j
LIVE WIRE.
Deceased Put His Hand Upon the Fa
tal Break and Was Killed In
stantly by the Tremendous
Current.
Coroner Ulll held an Inquest yesterday !
morning upon the body of Arnold Isidore !
Meyer, who was killed by a live wire at j
100T4 Market street October 13. The Jury j
returned a verdict of accident and made '
no comment upon the facts brought out I
by the testimony.
J. A. McGinley, after telling the Jury
how the accident occurred, replied to va
rious questions as to the Insulation of the
wires. He said that he could not say that
any wire In this city was perfectly Insul
ated, although it was possible to insulate
wire perfectly. If the Insulation had been
perfect in this case deceased mid not
have been Injured at all by taking hold
of the live wire that killed him. Bo far as
the witness was concerned ho would not
put his hand on any live wire in this city
no matter how well lt appeared to be In
sulated, but he had often done so when
i bilged by the necessities of his employ
ment as a telephone expert.
Every time a man touched a live wire
he took his life; into his hands. Live wires
are subject to abrasions by rubbing
against buildings and other wires, and the
insulation is often overcome by the ero
sion of the weather. He did not observe
any abrasion on the wire that killed the
oeceased. It was eighteen inches away
from the wall.
George A\ . Swinehard testified that
there was an exposed or worn spot in the
Insulation material of the wire at the
place upon which Meyer laid his hand
There was another bare spot in the samo
wire a few feet away. On the night of the
para.de in honor of the returning Califor
nia regiment his little boy, sitting at the
fame window, put out his hand and
touched the wire, but his hand was im
mediately jerked back by his mother Th->
child's fingers were burned by the current
C. O. Poole, superintendent of the elec
trical department, testified that Swine
hard bad not mentioned anything to him
fcbout the bare spot in the wire.
The jury returned a verdict that the de
ceased had met his death as the result of
an accident.
HOSPITAL EXPENSES
SUBJECT OF INQUIRY
DRUGS THAT WERE PAID FOR
WITH DOUBLE PRICE.
Grand Jury Considers the City and
County Hospital Expenditure
in Relation to Allowance.
The Grand Jury met yesterday after
noon, all but five out of the nineteen
members being present. The charges
brought against the City and County
Hospital officials for exceeding the ex
pense allowance was considered and a
number of witnesses were examined.
Dr. Gustave E. Sussdorf, ex-superin
tendent of the hospital, was questioned
ln regard to the working of the institu
tion. He testified that he did not look
Into the price paid for goods, only to see
whether they were received or not
Dr. Washington Dodge was called, and
he testified that he ..could run the institu
tion on $95,000 a year. When asked
whether there was any chance for swin
dling, he thought there was. and said
much could be saved by having a steward
â who is a competent judge of goods Dr
R. â -'â  Payne and Dr. Hodghead also Rave*
Information concerning the workings of
the hospital. b
The most startling testimony wai that
of William M. Hickman, who was for a
long time druggist at the hospital He
claimed that there was an overcharge of
60 per cent on the extracts and pills- also
that there was no real bid for drugs
The board will meet again to continue
its investigations on Thursday afternoon
at 2 o'clock.
Consideration of the school scandal de
tails of which were lately published by
The Call, was postponed.
Fishermen on the Fight.
Four of the fishmonger fraternity have
got into a serious difficulty with the
State Fish Commission. Last Saturday
Deputy C. A. Vogelsang visited the Union
Fish Market and discovered a box of
salmon in the possession of two fellows
named Oust! and Sposito, a violation of
the law which prohibits the taking or
possessing of these fish until Saturday
night. Mr. Vogelsang 'seized the catch
and was taking it away when he was set
upon by the two. aided by several of their
fellow ' employes. Not being of large
stature he was no match for the half
dozen brawny fishermen, who hurled him
aside and carried off the box of fish.
Yesterday the six were arrested on
charges of having salmon in their pos
session during the closed season and of
assaulting and interfering with an officer
in the discharge of his duty. Bail was
fixed at *200 in each cab*
EMPORIUM MANAGEMENT
ENTERTAINS EMPLOYES
C-_. .HE -hundreds of employes of the Emporium and
Golden Rule Bazaar danced last night to their
hearts' content and the management paid the
( _i piperâ ln this, instance Professor John Mar
quardt's Emporium orchestra. The great doors
to the big establishment were closed to the public at 6
o'clock and opened afterward only to admit the gay com
pany of workers, come to enjoy the hospitality of em
ployers.
The occasion was the second annual ball tendered by
the management to its army of helpers, and as on the
former occasion nothing was left undone to add to the
evening's enjoyment. The great dome, around which
the dance was to move, was brilliantly lighted and the
first and second floors were set off with cut flow-ers and
potted palms and ferns. In the cafe were set scores of
inviting tables, sided over by daintily- clad waitresses.
Above ln the band stand was the dynamo of the dance,
the orchestra.
No prettier place for such a function could be imag
ined. Even with the vast horde that puts i's shoulder to
the wheel in the great establishment there was not the
slightest chance of crowding or overheating or becom
ing uncomfortable. The broad circle of newly waxed
tloor around the dome seemed Ike an Invitation to waltz
forever, and the commodious carpet room held a similar
temptation for those preferring to "dawnce the lawn
cers."
That the employes appreciated the courtesy of the
management was noticeable In the early arrivals and in
the thorough enjoyment manifested all through the
night and just a wee bit into the next work day. And
the young men and women of the Emporium make a
good looking throng. Of course last night they were
looking their best and they were an enjoyable sight to
see. The girls in their dainty and becoming gowns had
no suggestion in their make-ups of that primness which
is supposed i" be requisite for handmaidens of commerce.
They had left that all behind at 6 o'clock in the evening
PERJURY CHARGES AGAINST
BERT A. HERRINGTON
TECHNICAL POINTS REGARDING
ACCEPTANCE OF BONDS.
Preliminary Examination Begins
â¢ Before Judge Graham and De
velops a Peculiar Situation.
The preliminary examination of Bert ...
Herrington, ex-District Attorney of Santa
Clara County, charged with perjury on
the complaint of P. H. Bryant of the
Good Government League of San Jose,
was commenced before Judge Graham
yesterday. The defendant was repre
sented by Attorneys B. E. Cothran and
H. C. Moore of San Jose, ' and W. S.
Barnes. Herrington . was one of the
I sureties on the bonds of Ruby Raymond
of San Jose, and the alleged perjury con
sisted of the fact that he swore he owned
property in Monterey County of the value
of $14,000, free from incumbrance, whereas
it was mortgaged. .
Judge Mogan was the first witness, and
i he testified to the woman Raymond being
in his court and being held to answer. In
cross-examination he said that the
original complaints against the woman,
and on which the warrants were issued
for her arrest and the bonds accepted for
her release, had been withdrawn and new
ones substituted.
Judge Treadwell testified -to accepting
the bonds and that he believed then, as he
! believes now, that they were good. He
i simply asked Herrington if he were a
freeholder and was; worth $5000. He did
; not ask him if the contents of the bonds
were true. Attorney Cothran then moved
that the case be dismissed on the ground
thai Herrington had simply sworn that
jhe was a freeholder and worth $5000,
which was true, and anything else in the
affidavit was Irrelevant and immaterial.
The Judge reserved his decision on the
motion.
Prosecuting Attorney Wentworth said
he could not proceed further, as he was
unable to see the original complaints In
the Ruby Raymond cases, as Sergeant
McDonald, their custodian, was out of the
city. He admitted that If the original
complaints did not state a public offense
had been committed, the case would have
to' be dismissed, as the bonds on which
perjury was alleged were not necessary.
The case was continued til! this morning.
Will Observe St. Luke's Day.
St. Luke's day will be observed with
special musical service this evening by

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, -WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18. 1599.
to come out and be butterflies of fashion for a few
merry hours.
The music for the first dance was sounded at 9
o'clock, and from that time on till after midnight, when
the last of eighteen numbers had been stepped off, the
merriest time imaginable was had, with pleasant Inter
missions for little bites and many opportunities for little
tetes-a-tetes. It was. apparent that the enjoyment of all
was complete. The spirit of gladness and of that family
feeling between employers and employed which just such
occasions intensify was manifest on all sides. The man
agement overlooked no opportunity to enhance the pleas
ure of its guests, and the employes testified by their
looks and actions that it all was appreciated.
During the course of the evening the directors of the
Emporium and Golden Rule Bazaar appeared on the
scene and took part in the enjoyment. They were: Mr.
and Mrs. M. H. Hecht, Mr. and Mrs. Albert Dernham,
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dernham, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew M.
Davis, Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Dohrmann, Mr. and Mrs. W.
Kaufmann and A. B. C. Dohrmann.
Superintendent A. H. Martin looked after the general
comfort of all, J. G. Frazer acted as floor manager and
the following gentlemen constituted the reception and
floor committees: F. B. Hlnk, C. J. White, W. Dundas,
G. Palmer, C. C. Maedonald, Martin Flnberg. J. P.

"Cash" was not present. The management consid
ered his tender years and his general inability to dance
and provided another way ln which he could partake of
the general hospitality. Each of him. to the number of
200, was provided with a box or orchestra seat at the
Orpheum and there In a bunch he enjoyed everything on
the bill: To-day he will probably be telling his elders at
the Emporium that they were "not so warm "
RAILROAD MEN
SCRAMBLE FOR
SUTRO'S LINE
Sold to the Sutter-
Street Company.
REASONABLE FIGURE IS PAID
STETSON MADE THE BIDDING
EXTREMELY LIVELY.
Adolph Sutro's railroad, the machine
that brought the Market-street Railway
Company to Its knees and reduced all the
fares to the beach to 5 cents, -has passed
Into the hands of the Sutter-street Rail
way Company. Yesterday morning the
Sutro road was placed on sale in Judge
Coffey's court. After spirited bidding for
half an hour R. F. Morrow, president .of
the Sutter-street road, triumphed, and
the sale of the property was confirmed to
him for thefsum of $215,000. About $116,000
of this amount will be used for the pur
pose of liquidating the debts of the Sutro
road, however, which * were assumed .by
Mr. Morrow by express agreement When
he purchased the road.
When the matter of the sale of the road
was taken up by Judge Coffey yesterday
morning President J. B. Stetson of the
California-street Railway Company put In
a bid 0f. 5178,000, an increase of $19,000 over
the original bid made by the Sutter-street
company. Attorney Friedenrich, who
represented Mr. Morrow, objected to the
bid on the ground that it was not made
in good faith, and' Intimated that al
though Mr. Stetson was the president of
the California-street "company, he was
bidding for the road on behalf of the
Market-street company. Testimony was
then introduced with the object in view
of showing that the interests of the es
tate would suffer if the road fell into the
hands of the Market-street company.
Thomas Magee, the well-known real es
tate agent, said that in his opinion an op
position line to the beach should be main
tained if the interests of the Sutro estate
were to be considered, and said
that he believed the estate would profit
if the Sutter-street company came into
possession of the road on a bid $50,000
below that offered by any other company.
E. B. Pond testified that he offered the
road to Mr." Stetson, but that he refused
to bid. Hence the, belief that he repre
sented the Market-street company during
the" sale proceedings ln court. After Mrs.
Merritt had testified that in her opinion
the California-street company had re
fused transfer connections during the
building of the road, Mr. Stetson was
called to the stand. He confessed that
he had once asked H. E. Huntington why
he did not buy the road, and had also
conferred with Superintendent Lynch of
the Market-street company. Mr. Stetson
then lost his temper. He said that he had
made a bid for the road and was prepared
to pay the amount offered and saw no
reason why he should be catechised. .
R. H. Lloyd, who represented the ex
ecu tors of the Sutro estate, then said that
all he desired was to protect the interests
or the estate, and then the court ordered
the sale to proceed.
Attorney Frledenrich then objected to
Mr. Stetson's bid on the ground that It
was made too late, but the court held
otherwise. "Mr. Stetson's bid is 1178.000."
said Judge Coffey, "do I hear any other
$â¢ nnn n^V " riede " r,t * raised the bid to
JIMJ.iiOO, and by spurts the amount offered
W l nt iÂ« u i ) to Â«205.000. Here Mr. Stetson
asked for a continuance that he might
consult his confreres, but it was objected
to. Mr. Stetson then offered $206,000. and
the opposing bidder went $4000 better
Mr. Stetson raised the bid $1000 and then
demanded further time. President Mor
mir f â¢ C^ r 3? re S entatlve then .lumped to
$^10.000 and the battle was won. Stetson
hurried to a phone, held a short con
ference with his backers, and. returning
into court announced that he had no
further bid to offer. Judge Coffey then
confirmed the sale of the road for $215 -
TOO and it passed Into the hands of the
Sutter-street company.

Wheeler Sits With the
Board.
â â *
MAKES HIS OFFICIAL BOW
â¢
HIS RECOMMENDATIONS FIND
IMMEDIATE FAVOR.
*
Many Changes in the Medical Col
lege â Wilmerdlng School In
structors Named â Inaug
ural Exercises.
At their very first official opportunity
since the arrival of President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler to take charge
of the University of California the
Regents hastened to do everything
possible to assure him that they
meant what they said when they told him
that he would have their fullest assist
ance and sympathy in his new office. At
the meeting of the board yesterday after
noon at the Hopkins Institute he had only
to offer a suggestion to have the board
vote unanimously in its favor. He made
numerous recommendations for the reor
ganization of the medical college. They
were joyfully adopted. He asked for a
private secretary to help lighten the presi
dential burdens. The board empowered
him to employ one at a salary of $1000 a
year. He made several recommendations
for the appointment of instructors at the
Wilmerdlng School and they were con
curred in, despite the fact that the pro
fessor of blacksmithing will get a larger
salary than the instructor in arithmetic
and trigonometry. Slight changes recom
mended in title- and salary in other de
partments of the university were also
adopted.
In return for all this nice treatment
President Wheeler was generousness per
sonified. He announced his intention of
reviving the lnstructorshlp in ancient his
tory, now unfilled, in order to do this, he
said, he would assume the role of instruc
tor for the second half of this college
year and recommended that the board se
lect for the position, beginning July 1.
1900, with a salary of $1000, William Scott
Ferguson, Ph.D., now in Europe. The
recommendation was adopted.
The meeting was called for the purpose
of considering the formal inauguration of
Presidenl Wheeler. The committee to
which the arrangements had been referred
reported, recommending as speakers for
the occasion President Daniel C. Oilman
of Johns Hopkins University, President
David Starr Jordan of Stanford and Re
gent A. S. Hallidie. The inauguration ex
ercises will take place on the campus at
Berkeley October 26, beginning at - p. m.
The sum of $700 was voted to defray the
expenses of the Inauguration.
President and Mrs. Gilman will arrive
hece on the evening of October 23, and
after participating in the inaugural exer
cises at Berkeley will be the guests of
Mrs. Hearst at Pleasanton, October 27.
They will remain in California two weeks.
It was moved at the meeting that a recep
tion be tendered them at the Hopkins In
stitute. The chair appointed Regents
Denicke and Hellman and President
Wheeler on a committee to arrange a
suitable date.
The Regents also accepted an Invitation
extended on behalf of the Alumni Asso
ciation by Dr. d'Ancona, W. A. Beatty,
George Edwards and Herbert Dam to
take part in a banquet at the Palace Ho
tel to President Wheeler on the night of
his inauguration. A banquet in honor of
Mrs. Wheeler will be given the same
evening by the wives of the Regents and
the j'oiing ladies of the university.
The finance committee's report recom
mending an additional appropriation of
$6500 tor the enlargement of the Harmon
Gymnasium, making the total $10,000, was
carried. Regents Hearst an.; Hallidie br
ing excused from voting. Regent Denicke
explained before the vote was taken that
the gymnasium, to be enlarged as it
should be to accommodate commencement
day crowds, would cost $20,000. Under the
appropriation as increased it will only seat
2100.
The following recommendations of Pres
ident Wheeler were adopted:
W. L. Jepson, promoted from Instructor to
assistant professor in botany; W. C. Merriam.

RUSSIAN EXILE HAS
FEARS FOR HIS LIFE
Paul Malnicoff Troubled by a Noc
turnal Visitor in His Residence
on Natoma Street.
Paul Malnicoff, a Russian, who was
banished from his native land to Siberia
about twelve years ago, and who later
escaped to San Francisco, has fears for
his life. He claims that some mysteri
| ous nocturnal visitor, whom he suspects I
jof being a subject of the Czar, climbs :
j over his roof nightly with the Intention of j
assassinating him when the opportunity j
! presents Itself. The trespassing stranger, j
| he says, carries a dark lantern, the rays
j of which he sends through the skylight i
! and into the room occupied by Malnicoff j
I and his wife.
i Twelve years ago Malnicoff was a stu
, dent in one of the Russian colleges. He j
' exercised the right of free speech and in- i
I curred the displeasure of the Russian
j ruler. His exile to Siberia followed and i
; he remained there until four years ago,
when he made his escape and came to ]
this City. 77 7 :â â¢ â ;:â : |
Since his arrival here his peace of mind \
has been disturbed by several queer oc
currences. On one occasion he became
suspicious of food which was served to j
: him in a certain house and refused to eat
it. Instead he fed the stuff to two dogs,
i both ot which died a short while after
i ward. Since he has been residing at his
present address, lOOl'/s Natoma street, noc
turnal visits have distressed Malnicoff to
such^n extent that he now sleeps with a
rifle at the head of his bed and threat
ens to shoot the intruder when he again
makes his appearance. The exile believes
I that some one, loyal to the Czar, who has
discovered his identity, Intends making a
I target of him to satisfy Russian justice.
