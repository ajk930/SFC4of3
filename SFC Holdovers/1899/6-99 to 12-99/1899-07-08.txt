AUSTIN, Tex.. July ".âFurther
evidence of the terrible stress
and destitution of the many
thousands of refugees in the in
undated region was brought to
light to-day. It is ported by reliable
persons, who have visited the scene of
devastation, that a large number <-f
negroes have already succumbed to the
pangs of hunger. In Washington,
Austin. "Waller, Fort Bend and Bra
7-ioria counties the work of rescuing the
water-bound inhabitants was contin. I
tied all last night and to-day. Scores!
of men. women and children were -say- j
ed "with barely sufficient life left in .
their Vidies to enable them to hold on,
to th*-: branches < -f trees "> which they j
had been clinging for t_ past three I
days.
Relief boats were to-day able to ;
reach the Sand Knoll, in Austin Coun
ty and word was received from, there
this evening that the 500 people, who
had been huddled together on the lit- ;
tle plat of ground for the past four
days had been rescued. The experi
ence of this colony of refugees was ter
rible in the extreme. When the flood
came they were driven from their com
fortable homes and sought to make
their wav to higher ground. They,
found that the waters had made a wide
detour, and that they were already on !
an island. This island decreased in
area rapidly, nd for the past four days
embraced only about three acres. On i
this little space the refugees gathered
-with a large number of cattle and ;
horses, and to add to the horror of the
situation, it was made _ place of ref- ,
uge by thousands of venomous snakes. j
with dee;- and other wild animals. The j
snakes writhed in and out among the j
terrified and suffering people, and a :
number were bitten and are still in a
critical condition.
It will take the people of the inun
dated region several years to recover
from the effects of the calamity. There .
are many instances of wealthy planters
having had all their Tops and movable
property destroyed by the flood, leav
ing them practically penniless and de
pendent upon charity for food and
clothing for themselves and families.
This condition of affairs is particu
larly true in Fort Rend, Brazioria and
Austin counties, which were largely de
voted to sugar cane culture. These ri<M I
and highly improved plantations have {
built up within the past twenty-five i
years, and on each of them there was
from $50,000 to '$200,000 worth of im
provements in the way of sugar mills,.,
refineries, fine stables and residences.
All these are gone.
Advices were received hereto-day that

MAN AND WIFE FOR
SIXTY-FOUR YEARS
SAN DIEGO. July Mr. and Mrs. C.
K. Smith of this city celebrated the sixty
fourth anniversary of their marriage to
day by giving a -banquet to their children
and -heir children's children. Those pres

wife, Mrs. Berry being a daughter of the
host ar.d hostess. J. Russell- Smith of :
this city and Mrs. Rosa Eigemann of â

present, though there are two sons of the â

although no definite information had
been received from the convicts who
were working on plantations in the
flooded regions, it is believed that they

the waters began to rise and that there
are nci cases of drowning among th-?m
This applies only to the leased convicts.
_*>"â¢â¢ information was received from the
inundated State penitentiary planta
tion in Fori. Bend County, where sev
eral hundred convicts were employed.
The taking care of 30,000 or mere des
titute negroes is going to be a big job.
They seem to be absolutely indifferent
as to their conditions and fate. Many
of them were prosperous planters be
fore the flood came. . They had been
ever since the late war accumulating
their modest fortunes, and to have all
swept away in a few hours is such a
shock that they are stunned.
it is now' the accepted belief that
there will be but little replanting of
cotton. It will be too late in the sea
son before the ground is in condition
to work, even should the flood subside
rapidly. The refugees will have no op
portunity of making a crop, and the
planters whose places have suffered
such destruction will have no work to
give them until next season. In the
meantime the unfortunates must not j
be allowed to starve. It will take a
large amount of money to tide them j
through the next several months.
The general stagnation Of railroad
traffic Is being gradually removed.
Hundreds of workmen are doing quick
work in making repairs to roadbed,
track and bridges, and the former reg
ular service on several of the affected
lines was restored to-day. The first di
rect and through mails from St. Louis
and the North and East reached here
to-day.
Governor Savor? received the follow
ing message this evening from Mayor
John Phillips" of San Felipe, Austin
County.
We have a thousand sufferers from the
Brazos flood. Five hundred are p. need
of food and clothing. They are starving
Help us. We have done and are doing all
we can. but our resources have all been
swept away.
The Governor replied by pending $2000
to Mayor Phillips to be used in buying
food supplies. The shipment of 20,000
Government rations reached Richmond
this evening and the work of distribu
tion among the needy was immediate
ly begun. A number of United States
Government boats are plying the wat
ers, rescuing the refugees and taking
food supplies to the starving ones.
Telegrams were received by Governor
Sayers to-day from charitable people
of Texas and distant parts of the coun
try, tendering financial aid to the flood
sufferers of the State. Frank Gould of
New York City wired the Governor to
draw op him for $5000 and to apply the
sum where was most needed. Presi
dent Richard A. McCurdy of the Mu
tual Life Insurance Company and Col
lis P. Huntington of New York each
contributed $5000. H. P. Hollins & Co.
of New York contributed $1000. A St.

later the young couple removed to Graf

Backwoodsman. In 1839 he moved to
Rock Island, 111., ancl in 1^47 to Mon
mouth, 111., where he published the Mon

Mrs. Smith came to California, spending
the following winter in. San Francisco.
In 1876 they came to Southern California
and li.:-. lived a retired life since.
Fourteen years ago to-day Mr. and Mrs.

The attention of the War Department
has been called to a. peculiar effect of
the recent flood in the Rio Grande
River. The former channel of the er
ratic stream passed within a few rods
of Fort Ringgold, Tex., and the pump
ing station was so located as to afford
an adequate water supply for the army
post.- . During the recent big rampage
the river cut a new channel, slicing off
a large section of Mexico, and placing
about a mile between the post and its
present channel. The pumping station
was not prepared for such an emerg
ency as this, and the water supply at
the post is now cut off until some other
means of obtaining it ( an be devised.
The Intern -fi-uml Water Boundary
Commission will be called upon to In
vestigate the question of the rightful
boundary between the two countries at
that point.
RELIEF COMMITTEES
ARE WELL ORGANIZED
GALVESTON, Tex., July 7.â The sit
uation in the Brazos Valley is rapidly
improving. The river is falling. There
is an unconfirmed rumor that five lives
were lost near Sartartia in Fort Bend
County. The report sent out Wednes
day from Brookshire. Walter County,
that two lives were lost there now ap
pears to be an error. Those who were
supposed to have been drowned persist
in making their reappearance.
Relief committees are now well or
ganized. At Brookshire the relief com
mittee has opened a commissary and
Issues a. half ration per capita. Precau
tions have been taken so that only the
deserving shall get these rations, and
therefore the committee issues to the
planter for all the tenants he had when
the flood came.
D. S. ('agent, a prominent citizen of
Brookshire, has ordered a carload of
cotton seed which he proposes to give
to all who will plant and undertake to
cultivate the crop. He says, moreover.
that crops of cotton, sorghum, Kaffir
corn, June corn and potatoes can be
raised now if the people had the seed,
but they have neither seed nor money,
and he suggests that contributions of
seed would help them. These crops
would enable them to live until the be
ginning of next year, when they would
be able to draw supplies from the-mer
chants from the prospective crops.
There are rations enough at Brookshire
to last for a week or more. Along the
Brazos alone it is estimated more than
10.000 negroes have lost everything. The
loss by drowned horses, mules and cat
tle is something enormous.'

WALLACE, Idaho, July 7.â
The methods employed by the
State authorities, aided by
the military, Id obtain testi
mony against those accused
of participating in the riots of April 29
were brought to the attention of the
court to-day in the trial' of Paul Cor
coran.
The defense filed several affidavits in
support of a motion for continuance, on
the ground that the defendant could
not have a fair and impartial trial at
this time because of the intimidation
practiced by the military, authorities

to a remote corner of the pen and
made to stand : gainst a fence facing
the soldiers, who then prodded him sev

which they cocked and aimed their
rifles at the prisoner and assumed a
firing attitude. Simpkins was then told
! by Burch, the superintendent of the
Bunker Hill mine, that it was well
; known that he (Simpkins) could iden-
tify many of the rioters, and that if he
did not tell all he knew regarding the
occurrences of the 29th he would have
to suffer the consequences.
Simpkins says he expected to be shot,
but refused to perjure himself, and

MYSTERY FADES INTO
A DOMESTIC SCANDAL
Miss Florence Campbell's Melodramatic
Plot to Capture Rathom From
His Wife.
Divorce and Not Murder Was the Purpose of the
Clumsy Schemeâ Rivalry for
the Husband's Smiles.
THE melodramic mystery in which
John R. Rathom and Miss Flor
ence M. Campbell figure as prin
cipals has practically been solved.
The affair possesses no more in
terest now than attaches to the dis
agreeable recital. of an illicit associa
tion between a man and a woman. The
case has developed simply into the ex
pose of the woman's shame and the
man's dishonor, coupled with the
woman's clumsy scheme to retain her
lover's affections and force him to
sacrifice his wife. The police have in
vestigated the matter thoroughly and
have found nothing to warrant even a
suspicion that an attempt to commit
murder was made.
There is nothing to indicate that poi
soned candy was sent through the
mails nor is there a single fact to show
that either Miss Campbell or Mrs. Elsie
Scheib was poisoned. That they were
ill there is do question, but that their
illness was the result of theirown efforts
there appears to be ample proof. The
facts in the case indicate that the ab
surd plot was conceived in the Scheib
household with the purpose of assisting
Miss Florence M. Campbell to secure
a monopoly of the volatile affections of
thorn.
Miss Campbell knew that Rathom
was becoming very weary of her. He
wished to be reconciled to his wife â a
wish that did not meet with the appro
bation of Miss Campbell. Rathom had
tried time and again to rid himself of
his mistress. He had given her money
to leave the city and go to her home.
He had promised his wife *.hat his
liaison with the woman would cease.
Miss Campbell knew all of this and
determined to. prevent, if possible, the
Joss of her lover.
While the police have not established
the identity of the person who sent the
candy through the malls, they have a
moral conviction that it was sent by
Miss Campbell to herself and was not
poisoned. There is everything to Indi
cate that th Scheibs were parties to
the plot and were animated by a de
sire to clear the way for an unimpeded
play of Miss Campbell's affections upon
Rathom.
The clumsy schemers believed that
Rathom would fall into the net, accuse
i his wife of attempted murder and sink
gratefully into the expectant arms of
Miss Campbell. When the melodrama
was at its height the male Scheib. igno
rant of the possibility of publicity or
exposure. Informed Rathom that the
I crime of .poisoning the female Scheib
j and Miss Campbell would be condoned
j if Mrs. Rathom would leave the State
! and sign a document admitting that
| she had deserted her husband and was
'I willing that he. should accept the law's
redress in divorce. Meanwhile Mrs.
| Scheib and Mis;- Campbell were rapidly
â¢recovering '" from a dose of mustard.
which is disagreeable but not danger
j ous when taken internally. ; Rathom
refused the bait and an unenviable no
j toriety followed for - all i concerned.
I Miss Campbell has lost her lover, Mrs.
Scheib is more than ever convinced that
a dose' of mustard is not a love talis
man even by proxy. Mr. Scheib is splut
tering in a sea of his own contradic
tions and Mr. and Mrs. Rathom are
debating the propriety of kissing and
making up. As far as public interest is
concerned the last curtain has been
rung on a domestic drama that has
enough of seriousness in it to make it
comic.
The life threads of Mr. Rathom and
Miss Campbell crossed at Santa Cruz.
Rathom is a newspaper man and at the
time of the meeting Miss Campbell was
an ambitious novice in the field of
newspaper work. She' sought encour
agement and Rathom gave it. She
asked instruction and Rathom supplied
it. The association reached a climax
that appears to be not unusual. Mrs.
Rathom learned of the affair and tried
in a woman's way to win back her hus
band.
She went to Miss Campbell and
begged her to be decent. Miss Camp
bell pleaded that she had been deceived,
claiming that Rathom had represented
himself to her as an unmarried man.
In this assertion Miss Campbell said
what she knew to be untrue. She re
ceived many letters from Mrs. Rathom
during the negotiations for the pur
chase of a husband. Several of these
letters were sent by messenger and not
through the mails, a fact which is of
great significance in connection with
subsequent events. Up to this time
neither Rathom nor Miss Campbell had
met the Scheibs.
The newspaper man and his mistress
were living at 610 Ellis street for a j
while and then .m- -âd. In December
they returned and again sought iodg-
Yu^s. They i'ound a new landlady in
. barge-â Mrs. Elsie Scheib.- Mrs. Scheib
had lived at Turk and Hyde streets,
renting three rooms from Mrs. Ella
Parker. In December Mrs. Parker re
ceived a stroke of what she believed to
be good fortune. A very dear friend of
hers, who has served with distinction

upon legislative committees .of public
morals, had! been elected to the State
Senate. Mrs*. Parker believed that an
era of prosperity had dawned and she
asked Mrs. Scmelb t" -Â«rlve up her rooms.
Whether or not Mrs. Parker was justi
fied In her lhopes by the realization is
another storj^*, but perhai j Senator Slg
Bettman cart tell. At all' events. Mrs.
Scheib moved. She went to 610 Ellis
street and , shortly after received
Rathom and Miss Campbell as lodgers.
Mrs. Scheil/Â» and Miss Campbell be
came great friends. They were very
thick In the' company of each other
and Miss Campbell assures the public
that Mrs. SclUib is not only her friend
but her benefactor. In April Rathom
and Miss Campbell left the Scheib
household. ' The Schelbs â¢ understood
thoroughly thi relationship existing be
tween Miss .Campbell and Rathom.
The dressmaker knew -that Rathom
had deserted ,his .wife and that Miss
Campbell wished to make the deser
tion permanent. After leaving 610 Ellis
street Miss Campbell called there pe
riodically for hjier mall. 'â¢'â¢/>'
On Thursday afternoon a week ago
a package and) a letter for Miss Camp
bell were dell red by a postman. On
Friday afternoon Miss Campbell -called
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
and received them. The letter was one
which Miss Campbell had written to
Mrs. Rathom and which was returned
upopened. Mrs. Rathom had written
upon the letter the name and address
of Miss Campbell. The package was an
oblong, wicker basket of unusual make
and filled with perhaos seventy-five
preserved cherries. The basket had
been bought at one place and the cher
ries at another and neither had been
purchased at a candy store. The most
rigid inquiry has failed -thus far to re
veal where the purchases were made.
Miss Campbell opened the basket and
saw its contents. There was neither
address nor message in the basket, but
this created no curiosity in the mind of
Miss Campbell. She saw the handwrit
ing on the cover and recognized it aa
that of Mrs. Rathom. The address was
written on an envelope which had been
cut. It will be remembered that Miss
Campbell had several of these address
ed envelopes. She* declared in answer
to an inquiry that she knew the person,
who had sent the box. She said it was
a lady friend living in Oakland. When
she said this she knew that the address
was in the handwriting of Mrs.
Rathom, who did not live in Oakland.
Miss Campbell offered some of the
cherries to Mrs. Scheib and to the
young dressmaker in the establishment.
Somebody said that it was dangerous
to eat candy so sent and particularly
by an unknown person. Miss Campbell
laughed away a reference to the Botkin
case and ate a cherry, although she
was absolutely sure that her own un
opened letter had just been returned by
a woman who has every natural right
to hate her and the box of cherries had
been addressed by the same woman
and enemy. Miss Campbell appears to
be an intrepid woman.
Mrs. Scheib also ate some of the cher
ries and then Miss Campbell . left the
house. She went immediately to a
drugstore on the corner of Ellis and
Larkin streets, and complained that
she had been poisoned with arsenic.
She described the drug as green and
bitter. It happens to be neither, a fact
which Miss â¢ Campbell possibly forgot.
Nothing more was heard of her until
midnight. She bore her stiff-rings until
then, when she sent for her paramour.
When he arrived. Miss Campbell was
sorely distressed from some internal
disturbance. Rathom gave her some
mustard, which she drank in liquid
form. She said she had been poisoned
by arsenic hidden in some cherries.
She declared that Rathom's wife had
.â¢ent the poison through the mails. The
..dy.from Oakland had disappeared,
diss Campbell then had a vivifying
spasm of recollection and told
Rathom that Mrs. Scheib had
also partaken of the cherries
and it would be wise to warn her
to take an antidote. The cherries had
then been in process of digestion for
over five hours. Rathom did as he was
directed, and was politely recommend
ed over the telephone to mind his own
business.
The next afternoon Mrs. Scheib re
ceived the attention of a physician, but
was not ill enough to require a second
visit. . Rathom had the cherries ana
lyzed, and the chemist said that there
was enough arsenic in each cherry to
kill a person in a very few hours. The

Entire Third ' Story Front of the j
Beautiful Washington Residence
Blown Out by the Violent
Shocks.
'âââ¦ââ
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 7.â Fire and
explosion In the residence of Captain j
Dickens of the United States navy at !
10: this morning resulted in the death j
i of Mrs. Dickens, who died before mcdl-; I
i cal assistance could reach her. Other j
persons about the house were severely ;
but not dangerously wounded.
The Dickens residence is a handsome I
three-story brick building on Nine- ;
teenth street, directly back of the Brit- â¢
1 ish embassy, and within a few steps of
I Dupont Circle. The first intimation of j
the disaster was a low rumble, followed j
by several violent shocks, .which blew j
out the entire third story front of the
residence. The firemen made their
way to the third story, and among the
debris littering the front room they j
I found the blackened corpse of the un
fortunate woman.
Mrs. Dickens' death was undoubt
| edly caused by the explosion, and it is
not" believed she suffered any from the
flames which succeeded. The rescuers
! were led to the spot by Plumber
Vaughan, who was himself burned
about the face and arms. He received
I these burns in a heroic effort to rescue
] Mrs. Dickens.
He and his assistant had entered the
room in which Mrs. Dickens sat clean
j ing some rugs when the explosion hap-
I pened. The two men were thrown
j down by the explosion. Vaughan seized
Mrs. Dickens and attempted to drag
' her from the room. The flames were, j
j however, so tierce that he was corn
' pelled to drop her and flee for his own |
' life. He thinks that she was then dead, i
The plumber and his assistant were ;
' putting on a gutter at the rear of the
! roof. Having completed the job, they j
I descended the ladder to the third story, |
! The plumber's assistant carried a light- j
ed melting pot. Vaughan detected the j
i strong fumes of gasoline, and through
I the open door to the front room caught
< a glimpse of Mrs. Dickens sprinkling ;
! liquid on the floor with the evident pur- '
pose of preparing to cleanse it. He gave ;
i warning to his partner that gasoline
j was being used and that there was j
: danger from the fire pot, but at this
I Instant the terrific explosion occurred,
i literally enveloping the entire third j
I story in a mass of flames.
The explosion was of such force that j
! it rent the stone steps in front of the)
house. The plumbers say that consid
erable quantities of the gasoline had j
apparently been spilled upon the floor.
Word was sent to the Navy Depart- i
i ment, where Captain Dickens is next
. to Admiral Cmwninshield at the head
of the Bureau of Navigation. The ex- |
| act character of the catastrophe was j
i not made known to him, but he was J
i brought hurriedly to the Dickens resi
j dence in a carriage. He almost fainted j
i as he was helped from the carriage up
[ the street entrance steps. He identi
â ) fied the body as that o. his wife. The ,
: body of Mrs. Dickens was borne to the >
I next house, where a -surgeon of the
I navy resides. .
Captain Dickens is one of the best
known office*** connected with the Navy
Department, and he was brought into
prominence at the time the Maine was.
blown up at Havana. He was then
acting chief of the Navigation Bureau
and it fell to his lot to receive the first
dispatch from Captain Sigsbee, giving
information of that disaster.
Mrs. Dickens was an authoress of
some note, one of her best known books
being "Around the World in a Man
of-War." She was also a frequent eon*
trlbutor to magazines.
MYSTERY FADES INTO

' ladies had escaped most fortunately.
Then came the climax to the comedy.
Mr. Scheib appeared to tell Rathom
that Mrs. Rathom must leave the State
at once and agree in writing to permit
Rathc-m'to secure a divorce. The di
vorce of Rathom and Mrs. Rathom
j was no concern of Scheib, but. it was
j a "matter of vital moment to his friend,
1 Miss Campbell. Scheib had seen very
little of Miss Campbell after she had
left his home, but his wife had seen
much of the lady. Scheib insisted that
Mrs. Rathom had sent the poisoned
candy, but how he discovered the as
i sumed fact is not known. Miss Camp
i bell had not told either him or his wife,
as the Oakland lady had not disap
peared from the scene until after Miss
Campbell had disappeared, from the
Scheib house not to* return.
Mr. Scheib's business instinct also
asserted itself,- and he demanded $50
from Mrs. Rathom to pay the physician
who had attended Mrs. Scheib. The
' money. was not paid and Mrs. Rathom
' has not left the State. In this way the "
! affair appears to be ended. Rathom is
! quite sure that neither his' wife nor
â¢Miss Campbell sent the poisoned cher
! ries, and he is positive that he did not
; do so. He was around town last night
j with Miss Campbell making these as
surances. â¢,
Mr. Scheib is authority for the state
ment that neither he nor his wife is
guilty and the police declare emphatic
ally that- nobody intended to poison
anybody and that no poisoned cherries
went through the mails.

DETROIT, July The mooted ques
, tion of the number ;of people brought
j ! into Detroit by the Christian Endeavor
j convention cropped out at the outset of
| j to-night's meeting., in Tent Endeavor,
when Secretary Baer took occasion to
j publicly criticize the . .Detroit news
; papers for stating that the influx of
! delegates from other States was not
nearly as great as had been anticipated
'in the local committee's estimate. Mr.
â  Baer had no statement yet to. make as
I to the attendance as -compared with
| other-years/ He promised to make one
j I later, but he called. on all Endeavorers
present to rise. A large majority of
those present stood up, which Mr. Baer
; assumed to be proof of his view of the
j attendance question. . , -
The newspapers' estimate of the total
; visitors is 20,000 in round numbers. Mr.
! Baer. denied that anybody connected
; with Christian Endeavor committees
' had ever told Detroit people that they
, had reason to expect 50,000 Endeavor
ers would attend. -At all events the
i secretary insisted that the Christian
; Endeavor tents had never before been
so crowded. . â 
- Bishop B. W. Arnot (colored) presided
over the tent Endeavor meeting to
night. The Rev. Dr. Quayle of Indian
apolis, one of the speakers on the even
ing programme, was announced to have
been called to Kansas to the bedside of
his dying father. Silent prayer was of
fered in behalf of Dr. Quayle. The de
votional exercises were led by R. R.
Patterson of San Francisco, the mo
ments of meditation and prayer by
Rev. George E. Soper of St. Paul.
The address of the evening was by
Rev. John. Henry Barrows of Oberliu
College. During its delivery the rain
again descended, increasing until the
noise on the roof almost drowned the
sound of Dr. Barrows' voice and he was
compelled to desist. Umbrellas were
raised all over the tent, but compara
tively few left and the. crowd stayed
and sang sons after song, overcoming
all sounds of the storm and all ideas of
increasing discomfort. At length the
rain ceased long enough to allow Dr.
Barrows to proceed.
Largely attended evangelistic ser
vices were held during- the noon hour at
factories and public squares throughout
the city. The afternoon was given up
to conferences in the larger churches.

tempts to Relegate the Silver
Question to the Rear.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. July About 1000
people attended the .dollar dinner given by
the Young' Men's Democratic Club of
Columbus in the Auditorium, to-night. It
was the largest banquet which the local
Democracy has had j since that given in j
honor of the seventy-seventh- birthday of !
the late Judge Allen G. Thurman in' the :
same ball ten years ago. The affair was
.strictly democratic in Its simplicity, all
.classes being represented. There were
also a large number of ladles in the
assemblage.
The chief guest was Colonel William
Jennings Bryan, at the table with whom
were also seated Hon C. T. Callahan and !
George Fred Williams of Massachusetts,
Judge Tarvin of Kentucky, Hon. Allen W.
Thurman of Columbus, the toastmaster, !
and a number of others, prominent in
State politics. The entrance of Colonel
Bryan was greeted by. an outburst of ap- '
plause which lasted until after he had I
become seated.
Judge Tarvin. president of the League
of Bimetallic Clubs of Ohio Valley in a
vitriolic speech denounced the attempts I
being made to relegate the silver question
to the rear. 'He Insisted that the Issue
must be made as prominent in 1000 as it !
was in the Chicago platform. The party
must not tolerate any dicker or trade for
the purpose of obtaining the vote of New :
York. lie declared that the men in con
trol of the Democratic organization in I
New York City were notoriously out of
sympathy with the Chicago platform, and
said it was known to all men that the or-'
ganized wealth of the country owned the
New' York City organization body and
soul. He denounced "the efforts now be
ing made by the organized wealth of the
country in New York, in Chicago and In
dianapolis to destroy the force and power
of the Democratic party by mutilating the
Chicago platform of 1896." J
Colonel Bryan spoke on silver and
trusts.

When Bloodgood sued for a divorce j
I here in the early part of this year the j

WILL NOT CONSOLIDATE.
New York Central Not to Absorb the
Pennsylvania.
PHII_ADEI-PlirA, July 7.â promin.nt
official close to President A. J. Cassatt of
the Pennsylvania Railroad to-day denied
the published statement that the Penn
sylvania and the New York Central Rail
â¢ road had entered a compact by which the
two systems had practically become one.
To a reporter, he said:
"There has never been any thought ot
consolidating the two systems. The New
York Central is practically a family. -ail
road, owned by the "Vanderbilts, **hile
there are 30.000 stockholders in the Penn
sylvania road. The relations of the two
companies are pleasant, but as the Penn
sylvania Railroad is competing with the
New York Central for traffic the interests
of the two roads are not compatible and
consequently consolidation or amalgama
tion would be out of. the ouestlon."
The official denied the statement that
Mr. Vanderbilt is the largest stockholder
in the Pennsylvania Railroad.

M'LEAN' WILLING TO
HEAD THE TICKET
Is a Candidate for the Democratic
Nomination for Governor
vv'i.-U--. in Ohio.
WASHINGTON. July John R. Mc-
Lean, questioned t_i-day as to whether he
would be a candidate for the Ohio Demo
cratic gubernatorial nomination, made
this statement:
"If the Democrats of Ohio give me the
nomination and my friends ask me to take
it I will accept."
While there has been much agitation
recently about the proprietor of the Cin
cinnati Enquirer being a candidate for
the Democratic nomination for Governor,
yet his friends made no open or public
declarations here until to-day.
The declarations to-day were due to re
ports sent out to the fact that Daniel Me-
Conville and other friends of Mr. Mc-
Lean were in conference here and claimed
Mr. McLean was already assured of the
nomination by the Zanesvtlle convention
next month. There are othejvcandidates
for the nomination and soma." .** *.en
have canvassed the Stale very thorough
ly. The most prominent candidate in the
field is probably Colonel James KHbourne
of Columbus..-
It is stated also that there is a move
ment for Allen W. Thurman for second
place on the national ticket with Mr.
Brvan next year, and that the candidacy
of 'Mr McLean this year for Governor
would give him such prestige as possibly
to interfere next year with Thurman for
Vice President, as well as with Kilbourne
and others this year for Governor.

THE HAGUE. July 7.â The third
committee, sitting this morning at the
Huis Ten Bosch, discussed the scheme
for mediation and arbitration drawn up
by the Comite d'Examin. Many of the
delegates have only been acquainted
â¢with the proposals since yesterday, and'
they have not had time to consult their j
Governments. Consequently it was de
cided that when the committee ad
journed to-day it would be until July
17. in order to allow the delegates a â¢
week in which to consult their Govern- '
ments and receive final instructions. i
The scheme is headed "Draft of conven
tion for the pacific settlement of In- |
ternational conflicts." The first part I
deals with the maintenance of general j
peace; the second part with arbitra- ;
tion.
The reporter of the committee ex
plained lengthily the motives which in
spired the drafting committee in elabo
rating the heme.
M. Bourgeois, head of the French
delegation, thanked the reporter in
warm terms and congratulated him
upon his remarkable exposition. The
sitting was then adjourned until July
17.
During the discussion the plenary com
mittee amended article eight so as to pro
vide that when powers between whom
there is a serious dispute accept media
tion they cease 'all the relations in regard
to the disputed question, which shall be
considered exclusively referred to the me
diatory powers.
Three additional paragraphs regarding
the permanent court were also adopted at
the request of President Zorn of the Ger
man delegation; Count Nigra, head of the.
Italian delegation, and Sir Julian Paunce
fote. head of the British delegation, as
follows:
"Members of the permanent court
should enjoy and exercise all the func
tions of diplomatic privileges and immuni
ties. The bureau is authorized to place
its offices and organization at the disposal
of the signatory powers for the proper
exercise of any special arbitral jurisdic
tion. The. signatory powers undertake to
communicate to the bureau a copy of any
stipulation regarding arbitration decided
between them and all judgments of the
permanent court and they undertake to
communicate to the bureau the laws,
regulations and documents setting forth
the execution of judgments pronounced
by the court."
The proposed .convention without the
changes adopted to-day is as follows:
Article Iâ With the object of preventing, as
far as possible, recourse to force in Interna
tional relations the signatory powers agree to
use ali endeavors to effect by pacific means
settlement of differences â¢ which may arise
among them.
Article 2â The signatory powers decide that
in cases of serious difference or conflict they
will, before appealing to arms, have recourse,
so far as circumstances will permit, to the
good office., or mediation of one or several
friendly powers.
Article .Iâ lndependently of this the signatory
powers deem it useful that several- of the row
err, not committed to i!.- arbitration scheme
shall, on their own initiative, offer, as far as
circumstances permit, their good offices for
mediation to the contending states. The right
of offering their good offices belongs to powers
not connected ' with the conflict, even during
the course of hostilities, which act cannot
be regarded as unfriendly.
Article iâ The part of mediator . consists in
reconciling conflicting claims and appeasing re
sentment which may have arisen between con
tending states.
Article sâThe5 â The functions of mediators cease
from the moment it may be stated by nne
of the contending parties Or by â  the mediator
himself th;;- the compromise or basis of an
amicable understanding proposed 'by him has
not been accepted.
Article 6â <i..od offices and mediation have
the exclusion character of counsel and are de
void of obligatory power.
Article 7â The. acceptance of mediation, un
less otherwise stipulated, may have the effect
of interrupting the obligation of preparing for
war. If the acceptance supervenes after the
opening of hostilities It shall not Interrupt, ex
cept by a convention of contrary tenor, mili
tary operations that may be proceeding.
Article â The signatory powers agree in
recommending the application of special media
tion in the event of threatened interruption of
peace between members. Contending states
may each choose a power to which they will
entrust the mission of entering into a nego
tiation with a power chosen by the other side
with the object of preventing a rupture of
pacific relations, or In the event of hostilities,
of restoring peace.
Articles Â» to 14 provide tor the institution of
an international commission of inquiry for the
verification cf facts in cases of minor dis
unites not affecting the vital Interest or honor
of states but impossible of settlement !.-. or
dinary diplomacy. The report of an Inquiry
commission will not force an arbitral judgment,
leaving the ci mending parties full liberty to
either conclude an amicable arrangement on
the ba"*is of the report, or have recourse ulte
riorly to mediation or arbitration.
Articles 14 to 19 set forth the general objects
of and benefits It is hoped to derive from the
arbitration court, and declare that signing the
convention Implies, an undertaking to submit
in good faith to arbitral judgment.
Article With the object of facilitating an
immediate recourse to arbitration' for interna
tional differences not regulated by diplomatic
means the signatory powers undertake to or
ganize in the following manner a permanent
court of arbitration accessible at all times and
exercising Its functions, unless ' otherwise
stipulated between the contending parties In
conformity with i**e rules of procedure in-
serted in the present convention.
Article 21â This court is to have competency

tablishment of a special arbitration jurisdic
tion.
Article 22â An international bureau establish
ed at The Hague and placed under the direc
tion of a pern:-. secretary general will

tions of International law. enjoying the high
est moral consideration and prepared to accept
the functions of arbitrators. The persons thus
nominated will be entered a? members of the
court on a list which will be communicated by
the bureau to all the signatory powers. Any
modification of the list will be brought by tho
bureau to the knowledge of the signatory
powers. Two or more powers may agree to
gether regarding the nomination of one or
more members and the same person may be
chosen by the different powers. Members of the
court are to be appointed for the term of six
years. The appointments are renewable. in
case of death or resignation of a member of
the court, the vacancy Is. to be Oiled in ac
cordance with the regulations made for the
original nomination.
Article 24â The signatory powers who desire

HEINE FOUNTAIN TO

TRIBUTE TO
THE FAMOUS
GERMAN POET
END OF MUCH STRIFE
â â¢ â
After All the Controversy in Europe
Over the Memorial It Is Finally
Erected in New York.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"IT EW . YORK,, July 7.â Amid a
\ chorus of 1200 trained voices
NEW Heine memorial fountain
chorus of 1200 trained voices
the Heine memorial fountain
1 will be unveiled at the intersec
tion ,of the Concourse, Mott
avenue and One Hundred and Sixty
first street, Borough of Bronx, at 4
o'clock to-morrow afternoon. The
memorial is. the result of a suggestion
of the murdered Empress Elizabeth of
Austria, who was a great admirer of
the German poet. It is of Tyrolean
marble. â¢
The tale of the Heine fountain has
become a cause celebre in Germany and
the United States. Innocent as it may
100k â for what can be more innocent
than a figure of Lorelei, the nymph of
the Rhine, and a trio of mermaids
chastely draped in fish nets? it has
roused hatreds that have their roots in
the remote past and put life into sneers
that were started in the middle*, ages
and challenged dogged prejudices that
belong to the history of Prussia as the
barnacle adheres to the'wreck, and in
jected into the pleasant discussions of
esthetics the venom of religious intol
erance and socialistic strife. The rabies
of religious, social and national ques
tions has made it impossible to ap
proach the Heine fountain calmly and
judge it on its merits as a work of art,
for any one who undertook that method
was met by a perfect whirlwind of sus
picions and insults, as if the excited
supporters of its cause could not be
lieve that everybody else was not in
fected by the prejudices which, alas,
did make their appearance in more
quarters than one.
The trouble began with the twofold
objection to Henri Heine as a writer
who scourged not only Prussia but all
Germany with whips of scorpions and
assailed as only a clever Hebrew can
assail the- Christians. It is true that
he directed his poisonous stings also
against the Jews, his own race; so
much so that many Jews, while proud
of the luster he conferred on their race,
have never forgiven him for the insults
directed against their most cherished
Ideas and habits. But their opposition
was not active. The national feeling of
the Germans, outraged by the satirist,
and the hatred of the Catholics, rein
forced by the dislike of a man aroused
who spoke far from indistinctly in fa
vor .if the Socialists, were powerful
enough to put a veto on a monument
to Heine within the limits of the em
pire.
The murdered Empress of Austria,
with all her influence as a German
Princess and Austrian Queen-mother,
I thus nominated to form an arbitral tribunal for
: a matter or question will meet on the date
fixed for the contending parties.
Article 25â The tribunal will usually sit P.t
I The Hague, but may sit elsewhere by consent
i of the contending powers.
Article 26â The powers not signing the con
vention may apply to the court under the con
ditions prescribed by the present convention.
Article 27- The signatory powers may con
' sider it their duty to call attention to the
existence of a permanent court to any of thrir
triends between whom a conflict is threatened,
' which must always be regarded as a tender
of good offices. .
Article 28 â A permanent council, composed ot
< the diplomatic representatives Of the signatory
powers residing at The Hague, and the Nether
i lands Foreign Minister, who will exercise the
functions of president, will be instituted at
The Hague as soon as possible after the ratifi
cation of the present act.
The council will be charged to establish and
J organize the international bureau, which will
I remain under its direction and control. The.
â  council will notify the powers of the constitu
tion of the court and arrange its installation,
draw up the standing orders and other neces
sary regulations, will decide on the questions
likely to arise in regard to the working of the
tribunal, have absolute powers concerning the
appointment, suspension or dismissal of func
tionaries or employes, will fix the emoluments
and salaries and control the general expendi
ture The presence of five members at duly
convened meetings will constitute a quorum.
Decisions are to be taken by a majority of the
votes The council will address annually to the
'â  signatory powers a report on the labors of the
court, the working of its administrative services
and of its expenditure. *
Article The expenses of the bureau are to
: be borne by the signatory powers In the pro
portion fixed for the. international bureau of
: the Universal Postal Union:
Article The powers who accept arbitration
i will sign a special act, clearly defining the ob
ject of the dispute as well ps the scope of the
arbitration. The powers* acts confirm the
underworking of the parties to submit in good
: faith to the arbitration judgment.
Article 31â Arbitration functions may he con
: ferred upon a single arbitrator or on several
arbitrators designated by the parties at their
discretion, or chosen from among the members
of the permanent court established by the pres
ent act Unless otherwise decided, the forma
tion of the arbitration tribunal is to be effected
as follows: X.eh party will appoint two
arbitrators who will choose a chief arbitrator.
In case of a division the selection is to be
intrusted to a third power, whom the parties
will designate, if an agreement is not effected
in this manner, each party is to designate
i a different power, and the choice of a chief
: arbitrator is to devolve upon them.
Article 32 When an arbitrator is a sovereign
or head of a state, the arbitral procedure de
pends exclusively on his august decision.
Article 33â ThÂ« chief arbitrator is president de
'jure. When the tribunal does not contain a
chief of arbitration the tribunal may appoint
its own president. He may be designated by
the contending parties, or, failing this, by the
arbitration tribunal.
Articles 34 to SO provide for the appointment
i of councilors, the selection of the languages to
\ be employed and the rules of procedure in .the
court, whose sittings are to be behind closed
doors
Article 51- A judgment agreed to by a ma

was not able to break down the ob
stinate refusal of Dusseldorf, Hamburg
and Frankfort to see a memorial of
Heine erected in cities once the h"'r>^
of the poet. Why not place it in Paris*,
they asked, since Heine deliberately
made a Frenchman of himself, accepted
a pension from the French Government
and employed his leisure in writing
philippics against his own from the
safe vantage of the capital of the he
reditary foe? Perhaps because Pari?
would have rejected the monument, not
for the reason that she disliked Heine,
but because she might not care for just
this kind of sculpture. At any rate, the
great rejected was proposed for New
York, and a. very handsome sum wa?
quickly raised in this city for its pur
chase and erection.
But there were objections raised. In
the endeavor to keep down the number
of public sculptures not of the first
quality, which threaten to debase the
average in New York beyond enduring,
this fountain. was voted not quite up to
the desired mark and rejected on this
side of the Atlantic. Then the warfare
between the partisans of the fountain
and their opponents began in earnest
and was waged long and fiercely. Fin
ally, however, the ooposing factions as
sumed a more peaceful mood and it was
decided to permit the fountain to be
erected in the Borough of the Bronx,
where it will have about it trees, flow
ers and grass. It stands as the result
of a compromise between the contend
ing parlies, the opposition having with
drawn its untenable argument that as
a monument it is unworthy of a pub
lic place, its friends having retired
from their demand that it shall occupy
one of the few most desirable spots in
the city for a memorial.
OIL TO BE USED
ON THE STREETS
Will Supplant Water at
Santa Barbara.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, July ..-Santa Bar
bara streets will hereafter be sprinkled
j with oil. The Board of Supervisors has
! decided to do away with the old style of
j using water to settle the dust and claims
it has solved the problem of turning bad
' roads into good ones and keeping them in
proper condition with less expense, at the
same. time making it easier for teams to
j haul heavy loads. The oil used is crude
petroleum mined at Summerland. With
two â¢ sprinklings in a morula's time the
roads will have a hard surface similar to
asphaltum and the cost to the county will
be only about $2. a month. Applied twice
each month the oil keeps the dust down
better than water applied twice each day.
The most sandy roads will become hard
and firm under this treatment.
Colonel Deaderick of Carperiteria was
the first to try the experiment, lie started
by using the sand around the oil wells
and finally concluded that crude oil would
be as good, if not better. It proved suc
cessful, turning roads that were impass
able ,to hard and firm highways. On the
i Fourth of July the Supervisors, escorted
j by Colonel Deaderick, inspected the work
I done on the roads in his district. They
were surprised and delighted, and the
j more they, inspected the more enthusiastic
I they became.
Large storage tanks will be erected
i along the railroad, and oil can be shipped
I from Summerland. a distance of six
miles, at very low cost. The Supervisors
I of each district will supply the necessary
j apparatus and in a short t.me oil will he
the only dust settler used. It will be es
pecially beneficial to the wheelmen, who
contemplated introducing a resolution for
.' a bicycle path from this city to Carpen
j terla. This plan was abandoned as soon
as oil was. introduced.

OPPOSE ASSESSMENT
OF GOVERNMENT BONDS
Los Angeles Savings Bank Officials
Declare It Will Cause Loss to
Depositors.
LOS ANGELES, July 7.â The officials of
tip- various savings banks of the city are
much disturbed over the action of the city
and county Assessors in having added
1140,000 worth of government bonds to thÂ«
list of taxable property. Of this amount
$59,212 50 belongs to the Columbia Savings
Bank, â  the German-American Savings
Bank owns $50,000 of these bonds and the
Southern California Savings Bank $32,000.
The presidents of these banks are deter
mined to light the assessments. They say
that if the assessment is allowed to stand
and they are forced to pay the tax they
will have either to stop doing business in
Los! Angeles or else they will have to de
crease the rate of interest paid to depos
itors.
The bank officials do not deny that they
tried to avoid paying taxes on the money
invested in the bonds, which are usually
considered non-taxable. They deny, how
ever, that they tried to evade the law.
They claim that the purchase of the
bonds is a legitimate and regular business
transaction, the element of profit in which
was to be the money saved from the Tax
Collector.

That Great Britain Is Not .

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. _ LONDON, July 7.â lh the House of
Commons to-day Sir William Camp-.
bell-Bannermann, Liberal leader in the'
House, asked the Government leader.
Mr. Balfour, if he had any statement
to make on the apparently official com
munication published in the Times to
day giving the names of a number of
officers said to"*Â» have been ordered to
proceed to South Africa for the pur
pose of organizing the residents as well j
as the police and local forces at various
points on the frontier.
Mr. Balfour replied that he was not !
awafe that it was an official communi- j
cation. He added that no contingency
had yet arisen which, in the opinion of
j the Government, necessitated a ma
terial increase in the forces now in
South Africa.
He added: "Wey however, think it
necessary, under the existing circum
stances, to take such steps as may
i bring the present force- up to the j
proper standard of efficiency and mo
i bility. The War Office would have been
extraordinarily wanting in its most
obvious duties if it was not prepared
for any emergency."
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman re- â¢
joined: "It is not with regard to bring
ing the present force to a proper stand
ard of efficiency that I wish to inquire,
but as to the paragraph which appears
as an official communication."
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman then
read the following extract already ca
bled to the Associated Press:
"The commander-in-chief has been
engaged in completing the composition
and organization of larger forces which
will be necessary to dispatch should the
negotiations with the Transvaal fail."
"It is in regard to this statement of
j the Times," he continued, "which is ap
: parently a new declaration of Govern
ment policy, that I wish to inquire." ,
(Opposition cheers.)
Mr. Balfour replied: "I do not think
there is any new declaration of policy
! in that paragraph, but I conceive that
I the- War Office would be extraordinarily
'. wanting in its most ordinary and ob
vious duties if it were not prepared for
I any emergency, however undesirable |
| and however unlikely, that could possi- !
j bly arise." (Ministerial cheers.)
Henry Labouchere, Radical mem
ber for Northampton, asked whether
j the officers spoken of in the communi
cation as going to South Africa were
going into Cape Colony and Natal to
organize the police and local forces,
I and if so whether it was with consent
; of the colonial authorities there.
Mr. Balfour replied he did not know.
Commander George Richard Bethell,
Conservative member for the Holder
ness division c*f Yorkshire, said: "Would
the gentleman say in what circum
stances the special service of officers
Is likely to be employed and against
what enemies of the Queen?"
Mr. Balfour replied: "My honorable
friend is quite as competent a prophet
as I am. and it will require a prophet
to answer for contingencies that may
arise."

Ex-Constable Coschina Under Arrest
at San Jose. ;v.
SAN JOSE, July 7.â Ex-Constable Mat
Coschina was arrested to-day for having
threatened to kill Attorney W. M. Beggs.
He was subsequently released on $1000
ball. His preliminary examination will be
held to-morrow. The trouble grows out
of an attachment served by Coschina a
couple of years ago while Constable. In
the trial of the suit the attachment was
set aside and judgment was given against
Coschina and became a lien against the
latter's property, although indemnity had
been given to protect the officer. For
some time Coschina has been preparing
to go to Angels Camp, and he had ar
ranged to borrow $1200 on his property, but
could not do so until this lien was re
leased. â¢ â 
Beggs is attorney for J. O. Hickey. who
holds the lien. Yesterday Coschina went
to Beggs and told him. his wife was seri
ously ill from worry over the affair and
if she died he would kill Beggs. Hence the
warrant.
Attorney Beggs. on the other hand, has
bought a revolver and declares he will
shoot Coschina should Coschina show his
head in his office. 'r;:A

Napa's Marshal Short in

â â¢ â â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA .felly 7. --For several weeks ru
mors have been afloat concerning.irregu
larities in the City Marshal's methods of
doing business. Official notice was taken
of the matter when at the last meeting of
the City CounÃl in June Mr. Jaensc!i,
chairman of the Finance Committee, an
nounced that the Marshal's reports had
not been made and filed each quarter, as
provided by law, for the last few years.
The Finance Committee was at this meet
ing instructed to make an investigation.
At the first meeting in June a new fi
nance Committee was organized, and that
committee first carefully examined City-
Treasurer Thompson's books and found
that they had been accurately and neatly
kent _that the figures tallied with ttw
cash on hand. The committee then turned
its attention to City Marsha P^aigueaus
books, to discover that that official was
short in his accounts on June 1. MÂ». m
the sum of 11697. some shortage dating
_._ far back as 1.94; that the total balance
due the city up to July 1. 1899 (not includ
ing returns made for licenses collected
Ju nef was $2007. Since such finding the
Marshal had paid into the city treasury
$945. The license money not turned over
in 1894 and from that date forward is for
KflKfilSSSi 1897 Chaigneau failed to
turn over the money for twelve "Cens"
collected from the Bank of Napa (which
institution pays $40 per quarter). The
stubs are in the book, but the money an-
ring to them is not in the city a
strong box. So far as the committee can
ascertain no returns have been made for
licenses collected from hackmen, draymen
and expressmen doing business in Napa.
The Finance Committee is assisted in
its investigations, which are by no means
yet complete, by City Attorney York and
City Treasurer Thompson. . .
Marshal Chaigneau was seen with ref
erence to the shortage this morning, He
said the irregularities had occurred in his
larger license collections during the last
two years; that he was something like
$1500 behind when he turned in $900 last
monthâ s3oo of the amount applying on
collections previously madeâ that he was
possibly $1200 behind now. but fully In
tended to make most of it good by the
next meeting of the City Council. He has

hopes to realize on and does not want his

HENRY LEFEVRE DIES
AFTER BRIEF ILLNESS
Was General Agent of the Pacific
Mail at Panama and One of the
Oldest Americans There.
Special Table to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PANAMA. July 7.â Henry Lefevre. gen
eral agent here of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company, died ' to-day, after a few
days' illness from broncho-pneumonia.
Deceased was one of the oldest and most
respected among the American citizens
here. He had resided in this city since
IS6_ and had been for more than thirty
years in the service of the. Pacific Mail
1 Steamship Company here and on the coast
in various capacities. The funeral this
! afternoon was largely attended by natives,
foreign residents and the American col
ony which especially held him in great
esteem. As a mark of respect all the
steamers in the bay displayed flags at
half-mast. â  , . __
Mr Lefevre was 58 years old. He was
1 born on the Isle of Jersey of an old Hu
guenot family, which fled from France to
' England at the time of the revocation of
the edict of Nantes. He arrived in the
: United States at an early age and served
during the War of the Rebellion in the
paymaster's department of the Union
navy. At the close of the war he went to
Central and South America as the repre
sentative of a New York syndicate of
capitalists. He settled in Panama and I
was next to the oldest American resident of
that place. He leaves a widow and seven
children, including four sons, the eldest of
' whom is a writer of note. The second son
i is a prominent mining engineer and the
third son controls the telephone conces
sion of Panama. Mr. Lefevre was one of
the intimate friends of De Lesseps of
Panama canal fame, and was actively
identified with that project.
AFTER THE BULLY HILL MINES
Captain de la Mar's Proposed Invest
ment in Shasta County.
REDDING, July 7.â lt is. reported here
that Captain de la Mar is negotiating for
the Bully Hill copper mines in this coun
ty, owned by James Sallee. The $250,000
bond* on the property held by L. A. Scow
den. a New York mining promoter, ex
pired on the Ist of July, and it is an
nounced Sallee will not renew the bond
to Scowden. About a month before the
expiration of the bond an expert named
Bulla, representing the Utah millionaire
mine owner, made a visit of inspection
to Copper City in the interest of Captain
de la Mar. but as hard feelings existed, it
is said, between Bulla and Scowden, the
latter refused to allow Bulla to enter .the
mine during the life or the Scowden op
tion. It is now said Sallee has raised the
price of the Bully Hill property to $350.
--000âthe same figure at which the Iron
Mountain mine was sold, and in which
Sallee held a third interest. A German
syndicate is making overtures for the
Bully Hill property.
A. W. Robinson of the engineering de
partment of the Southern Pacific Com
pany at .Sacramento made. a special trip
to the Copper City country a few days
ago. presumably to ascertain the feasi
bility of a branch railroad from the main
line. The Bully Hill mines are an im

: CHICAGO. July 7â Commissioner Gen
eral Peck is elated at the feeling of tha
French Government and of the exposi
tion officials at Paris toward the United
States. He has just received an official
cablegram from the Minister of Public
Works, through Embassador Cambon,
stating that the right to construct a pier
landing at the United States building has
been granted.
This has been a matter of negotiation
for eight months and there were serious
difficulties to overcome, and Peck feels
largely indebted to Embassador < 'amhon

day of a cable from the assistant com
missioner general announcing that a
special area of 10,000 square feet has been
set apart for an American limited rail
road train, which he thinks will reflect
great credit upon the American display.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
has agreed to aid in the construction or
the forestry building and will send logs
to Paris of a diameter that will make
a startling exhibition. The area, for the
life-saving service station has beer.

officers, and every other concession that
has been asked since the return of the

FAITH IN THE COLUMBIA.
Veteran Joel Ellsworth Praises the
New Cup Defender.
NEW YORK. July 7.â Captain Joel Ells
worth, who' steered the Puritan and May
flower to victory against the Genesta and
Galatea, respectively, says:
"The Columbia is a fine boat and I'm
sure she can beat the Defender in the
end. but not with those sails. The claw
topsail and jib are no good in windward
work, and that is the work that tells In.
a race. You mark my words, as soon as
her sails set as well as the Defender's
'she will outsail her."
"How many minutes do you believe the
Columbia can beat the Defender in a*
thirty-mile race, when she is in proper
trim?" was asked. : -
"Judging from Thursday's performance,
I should say that the Columbia can beat
her from five to eight minutes. From all
the reports I have read I do not find any
that she could beat the Defender running
free. I understand it now. Both are deep
draft boats and there is no reason why
she should go faster free, but depth does
not count in the windward work, for she
probably draws more than the Defender."

FRANKLIN TUNNEL ON THE VALLEY ROAD
IS NEARING COMPLETION.
PINOLE, July âLess than -.0 feet of bench remains to be cut through to complete the Franklin tunnel, on
the line of the Valley Road, between Stockton and Point Richmond. The headings v.-ere pierced through
this morning, leaving only the _______ work within the tunnel to be done.
The tunnel is 5700 feet in length, and work was put through by Foley Bros. & Muir, contractors of
St- Paul. â¢
The photograph shows the eastern face and approach to the tunnel.
Work is progressing splendidly all along the line. Eleven hundred feet en tunnel No. 2 has been put through,
leaving only a little more to be worked out. The entire length of 1300 feet on tunnel No 5 has been completed,
and all that remains now to be done is to timber that portion of it that has not reads got the sticks up. On
tunnel Ner. 1 there is only 400 feet left and on No. 3 all there is to prevent its entire completion is lack of ready
timber.
Since the Southern Pacific prohibited the sale of liquor on its roads ere has been some speculation as to
the action the Valley Road people would take on the same matter In respect to their own line. When seen yes
terday they refused to discuss the sale of liquor on their road further than to say that as they were not liquor
merchants they would probably sell nothing in that line. This may be construed either as a subterfuge to avoid
the question or as a left-handed way of stating that when the road is completed and in active operation it will
be run in a strictly temperate manner, and that when its employes, overcome by the heat of the interior, are
const" by a Sahara-like thirst, they will either slake it at the nearest water tank or bear their trouble with
patience and fortitude.

CANAL COMMISSION
WILL GO TO PARIS
Sub-Committee Intends to Examine
the Plans of the Panama
- Company.
â WASHINGTON. July 7.â A part of the
Isthmian Canal Commission will take a,
trip to Paris before a personal inspection
of the two canal routes is made.
At a meeting to-day it was, decided that
the original record of the Panama Canal
Company ought to be examined as a -pre
liminary to an investigation of the canal
routes. "Accordingly Rear Admiral Walker.
Colonel Ernest and Messrs. Morrison and
Burr as a sub-committee having charge
of this branch of the work, will start abou*
August*! for Paris, where they will spend
a month or so in goiner over plans, papers,
etc., of the Panama ''anal Company.
The company offered to furnish the com
mission with copies of any papers desired,

satisfactory results could be obtained by
going direct to Paris. Before going abroad
the commission will complete the organi
zation of special surveying parties, which
they desire to put in the field as early as
Possible. _ __
Ice Expensive at Redding.
REDDING. July 7.â A rise In the price
of ice was one of the first acts of the
local ice manufacturing plant after ab
sorbing the branch supply depot and the
agency of the Union' lee Company in this
city. For several years the' two concerns
were at war. the natural ice company re
ducing the price of its frozen product to
45 cents a hundred. while the local fac
tory maintained a 75-cent rate, and en-
Joyed nearly all the business at that. The
war was ended ten days ago by the local
factory buying out the natural Ice agency.
This is perhaps the first incident on re
cord in which a private enterprise has
swallowed a branch of a big monopoly.
The raise in price so far affects only the
small consumer.

SERIOUS STAGE IN
BOUNDARY DISPUTE
Fresh Instructions Sent
to Choate.
ââa
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. July 7.â
The official admission is made at the State
Department that the Alaskan boundary
negotiations have reached a very serious
stage.
Fresh instructions were forward* to
Embassador Choate to-day, but their na
ture will not be divulged by the ithori
ties. All that can be said with positive
ness _ that the United State, has not
withdrawn an inch from its proposition
to place the boundary line on the Dalton'
Trail two miles inland from the village
of Kluckwan, and that it will not do sc.
As Canada is urging ..Irea! Britain not to
relinquish Its demand for the establish
ment of the line between the village and
the Â»re, it is evident that a deadlock
has been practically reached.
Just what will be done in order to reach
an agreement the authorities are unwill
ing fa say. Negotiations for arbitration
in the spring failed as a result of Can
ada's unreasonable demand for Pyramid
Harbor, and now efforts to secure a mo
dus Vivendi for a temporary delimitation
of the line have practically come to an
end. v _ V !; - ,
In order that the peace of the mining
district in the vicinity of the territory in
dispute may be preserved, which was the
object of the establishment of a tempo
ran" line, some steps will have to be taken
of "a police character, in case of a final
disagreement.
The authorities are averse to despatching
troops to Pyramid Harbor and other
points near ___uckwan, because of the
effect it may have upon Great Britain
and Canada., especially in view of the re
quest of the British Government, made
some weeks ago. that such action be not
taken.

"And we had it in the Queen's palace
j as a recognition of the great womanhood
i of our country."
Mrs. Sewall said*. "The Queen looked
I ten years younger than when I saw her I
three years ago. Th* whole bearing of
her Majesty was a symbol that she who

CONSCRIPTION BILL
SPRUNG BY LANSDOWNE
Unpopular Measure Introduced in the
English House of
LONDON, July 7.â the House of
Lords to-day the Secretary of Stats for
War. Lord Lansdowne, Introduced a bill
which was regarded as the thin end of
the wedge of conscription, and is, there
fore, likely to render the Government un
popular. "Jhe bill, which is entitle! the
"militia ballot act," is intended to sim
plltv and regularize an existing act now
practically suspended in favor of volun
tary enlistment.
In his speech Introducing the measure
Lord Lansdowne carefully explained ilia:
the Government only wanted it read* the ;
first time, as there was no Intention to i
'pass it, and he repudiated "the idea of I
trying to introduce conscription by a side
wind." Personally, he said, he did not
favor conscription, but he thought it "ad
visable; that such a bill should be in read
iness if wanted." and that "the country
should realize how it stands with regard
to this question."
Already the Liberal papers are attack
ing the Government and asking what reed
there Is of such a measure unless con
scription is intended, and looking to th-? [
fact that recruiting is dwindling the Mil
will be regarded with great suspicion.

DEADLY KISSING
BUG APPEARS
AT SAN JOSE
Kitten Bitten by One of the
Insects Dies Within Ten
Minutes.
SON JOSE KISSING BUG.
SAN JOSE, July 7.â The deadly kissing bug, which is causing such
consternation in the East, has made its appearance in this city. As
yet its victim ls onV." a pretty kitten, but mothers are becoming alarm
ed for their children. Society girls are excited and there promises to be
a run on the dry goods stores for veiling and mosquito netting. The
pleasure of all children will be curtailed, and unruly infants will be quieted
and kept In check by threat? of this new bugaboo, thÂ« kissing bug.
There appears to be no mistake that the insect is a near relative of the
deadly oscillator seen on the Atlantic seaccast. It is identical with illustra
tions published, with the exception that its wings are jet black, while its
Eastern cousins are mottled.
The subject of the illustration accompanying this article was picked up
by some young ladies last evening and carried into the Garden City Drug
store, conducted by Edward Hoen. at the corner of Third and Santa Clara
streets. The nature of the find was not known at that time and the bug
was given to a kitten to play with. The kitten knocked it around with its
paws for a few minutes and finally took it into its mouth. It dropped the
bug instantly. as if it was a piece of hot iron. A few seconds later the
kitten was in' the throes of death and in ten minutes it was dead and stiff.
It had been bitten on the lip. as was indicated by a small blue spot.
Mr. Hoen was surprised at the deadly bite of the insect and put it into
a vial for future examination. The dead kitten was given to a garbage man
and hauled away. .
This morning Mr. Hoen saw in The Call a picture of the Eastern kissing
bug. and a comparison was made with the insect that killed the kitten. Ev
erybody pronounced it of the same species.
There is a fruit store next door to the drug store. In front of this the bug
was found. It is believed the bug was imported in a bunch of bananas or
pineapples from some tropical climate.

Special Dl_rat.h to The Call.
STOCKTON, July The fire of yes
terday almost erased from the map the
thriving town of Coulterville. The fire
started in the residence of Mrs. Boglioa.
in the bus:: part of town, and is be
lieved to have been caused by coal oil
which had been used in starting a fire in
a stove. This was a few minutes before
the noon hour, and soon the residence
was ablaze. Everything being extremely
dry, the house was soon enveloped in
flames, whyh were communicated to the
surrounding structures in a very short
time. So rapidly did the fire sweep from
house to house that in two hours and a
half sixty-seven buildings had been
burned to the ground. The business por
tion ot the town was a mass of charred
and smoking ruins, and but little of the
residence part remained standing.
Though the city fire apparatus in the
place - was an old-style hand engine, it
might have prevented a spread of the
flames but for the wind, which blew
heavily from the southwest. Strong ef
forts were mad- by. the residents of the
town to arrest the progress of the flames,
but without avail. The fire spread so
rapidly that there was barely time to
save stock in some of the stores, and
there was no time to save the buildings.
Notwithstanding the severe blow dealt
the town by the fire, E. A. Grensell. the
telephone agent, says there is no destitu
tion and no calls for aid. He expressed
the belief, that the people could pull
through all right, as none were in dis
tress. He placed the loss at $150,000. The
insurance, he said, was very* light. but he
thought rebuilding would be commenced
soon. .: .* j: . :
A generous offer was made this morning
by the Sierra Railroad to transport to
Coulterville free of charge any goods or
provisions which it might be desired to
send to the town in aid of the destitute or
needy, but the information subsequently
received from Mr. Grensell shows that
this will not be necessary.

HANFORD, July 7.â What came near
being a fatal accident occurred last night
to Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Howell. They were
ridlntr in a buggy behind a spirited horse.
Mr. Howell had a shotgun along with
which to shoot jack rabbits. The horse
shied at something and gave a sudden
jump. The jar threw the gun from the
seat. The hammer hit on one of the
springs of the buggy, discharging both
barrels.
The charge took effect in the upper part
of Mrs. Howell's" right arm. near the
shoulder. ' making a serious wound, but
not breaking any bones. Mr. Howell had
a very close call, some of the shot just
srrizir.e his cheek. The blood from Mrs.

Attorney J. N. E. Wilson changed his
Offlce a few weeks ago.
This is not exactly news, as the busi
ness headquarters of Mr. Wilson are gen- j
erally supposed to be about as perma- j
nent as the residence of a Kansan during
cyclone time. But there is a little item
of news connected with it, inasmuch aa
Mr. "Wilson's present office at 606 Mont- j
gomery street is at present as barren of
furniture as is the lot above referred
to during the season of devastating winds.
It all happened in this wise:
The season of noise, otherwise known as
the days immediately preceding and fol
lowing Independence day, opened on
Monday last. Mr. Wilson does not like
noise, unless it is the seductive jingle of
coins In his pocket, and accordingly hied
himself to the country for the three days
covering the period or noise.
At the expiration of the three days Mr.
Wilson returned to the city, and lo and
behold, strange things had happened. He
hied himself to his office at its erstwhile
location in room 170, -.6 Montgomery
â¢street, and found that a wonderful trans
formation scene had been enacted dur
ing his absence. The furniture was gone.
â Inquiries among other occupants of the
building elicited the information that
early Monday morning a young man
named Frank Lamar had visited the of
flce of Mr. Wilson and proceeded to re
move the furniture. To some, it ls said,
be told he was a representative of the
Tax Collector; others aver that he as
sumed the role of a ward cheated out of
his inheritance and seeking compensatory
damages. Whatever the facts or the case
may be, Wilson's office furniture and La
mar disappeared at the same time, and
neither has been seen nor heard from j
since, although Wilson, accompanied by a
corps of detectives, has sought both long
and sorrowfully. His version or' the af
fair is as follows:
"I went into the country for the Fourth
of July holidays. On entering my office
upon my return I found that everything
movable had been carried away. I In
quired among the other offices, and from
what 1 have learned I believe that the
goods were taken by Frank Lamar. I
know very little about Lamar. He was
left a sum of money through the death of
his parents, and a portion of It was placed
in my hands. I began paying it over to
him in small amounts about two years
ago, or at the time he came of age, and â¢
the hole amount, somewhat less than â 
T-000, has been paid into his hands. lie
was always hanging about my office, and
I think I have loaned him about $So over
and above the amount of his money In- i
trusted to my care. I understand that he
has told certain people that I never paid j
him the money, but this ls no*, so. I have
raid him ail or more. I will not accuse i
him of having taken my furniture, but I '
know that he was addicted to strong i
drink and was frequently in want of '
money. The matter has been reported to i
the police and detectives are working on i
the case. I hope to get back my furni
ture and library. That is all I have to

FILIPINO GIRL'S LOVE
FOR 0 CALIFORNIA BOY
Went to Negros to Be Near \-\er Soldier Sweetheart
and Now Is Prepared to Follow Hin) Home.
RITA FA MY is or was the Filipino belle bf Manila.- If she has carried
J out her avowed intention of following the California Regiment to San
> Francisco the capital of the Philippines is without a dusky queen, but
I if she aged her mind at the last moment and remained at home
V then she is still the belle of Manila, â '/:',[ .'*
During the stay of the California Regiment in Manila Rita became
madly infatuated with one of the soldiers named Osborne. She did.every
thing in her power to lighten the drudgery of garrison life for him, and
when he was sick she nursed him back to health.
When the regiment was ordered to Negros Island Rita pined away for a
while. Then one flay Manila awoke and found her missing. She had followed
the California boys to Negros and resumed her visits to the camp as though
nothing had happened. But when the news that the regiment was about
to be ordered home was given out the love-sick maiden was heart-broken-
She did not give way to despair for very long, however, but at once set
about making arrangements to come to California. AA'hen the transport Cleve
land was at the seat of war Rita was ready to leave for Hongkong as soon
as the regiment starts for home and the chances are that she will land here
from one of the China steamers as soon as the transport that carries her
lover drops anchor In the bay.
"Rita was attracted to the California boys as soon as they arrived in
the Philippines," said Chief Engineer Dill of the Cleveland yesterday. "She
used to visit their camp and bring them flowers and fruit, so her visits were
looked forward to by everybody. For Osborne she conceived a violent at
tachment, however, and the result is that she will follow the regiment home
to San Francisco. Rita is particularly good looking for a Filipino and is a
beauty when compared with her less fortunate sisters."

The British survey steamer Egeria ar
rived from Esquimalt, B. C, yesterday
morning. The English and Canadian Gov-
I ernments are to establish a cable between
I British Columbia : and Australia, which
will touch at Samoa and Hawaii. The
Egeria is now engaged in the work of sur
; veying the route. She will go from here
j to Honolulu, talcing soundings on the way, I
I and after coaling there will proceed to |
Apia. From Apia the soundings will be
taken to the nearest point cm the Aus
tralian continent.
The Egeria put in here for coal. She
will remain here about a week and will j
then proceed about her business. Her I
coal capacity is very small, and this fact '
is going to give Captain Smyth and his I
officers a great deal of trouble. She left â 
Cape Flattery about a week ago, and the
soundings were begun at once. As soon i
as the coal began to give out the warship I
had to put in here. When her bunkers are j
filled again the Egeria will go to the point j
where she left off and continue the work
of locating a bed for the cable until her
coal gives out. She will probably put into j
San Diego for a fresh supply.
The officers of the Egeria are the most l
expert surveyors in the British navy, and !
they are taking great care in making the j
soundings for the proposed cable. The
undertaking will probably occupy two
months before the survey* boat reaches !
Brisbane.
The officers of the Egeria are: Com- j
mander Morris H. Smyth, Lieutenants H. '
G. J. Sommervllle, Fred G. Learmonth. |
G. S. C. Simson and Horace C. Watson;
Paymaster B. F. C. Ames. Surgeon Jo- j
I seph Bradley, Chief Engineer E. J. Camp- '
bell and Boatswain James McGeachy. She
carries a picked crew of sixty-five men.
The Egeria is a composite sloop-of-war,
built at Sheerness in 1873. She is 940 tons
displacement, 160 feet long, 31 feet 3 inohes !
broad and 13 feet 3 inches deep. Her ar- !
mament is not very heavy and her coal
capacity la only 100 tons.
All the arrangements for the reception
of the Oregon A olunteers have been com
pleted. The Native Sons have appointed
the following committee to welcome the
returning soldiers: Lewis F. Bvington.
Henry Lunstedt, Judge F. H. Dunne, Hen

j gon will not be here to meet the Webfoot â

i decided whether to send the men on from '
: San Francisco by rail or by the regular ;

I have arisen over the action of the Super
visors In restricting the expenditures of

i pality for the next two months to the
' j limit as provided in the Finance Commit-
I tee's estimate, and Auditor Wells is at a

Since the formal notification was sent

' they are within the limit he will audit

i turn them all to the department whence
â  they came and let the selection be made

' ! been the Auditor's policy in the past, and
It has raised an exceedingly interesting
issue in the School Department and one
which. If Mr. Wells' theory proves cor
j rect, gives the teachers' claims for back
! salaries preference over the demands of
: merchants for furnishing supplies to the
! department. These demands were pre
sented at one time and greatly exceeded
the available funds, so the Auditor re
fused to pass upon any of them. They

! the Auditor Is of the opinion that they
i now have a preference over the others. .
Mr. Wells still maintains his position in
regard to the Sewer Commission, holding
that the board, being created when the
treasury was practically depleted and
there being no immediate necessity for it,
; the claims of the commissioners for sal
ary should not be given precedence over
prior claims. The. Auditor and Mayor re
cently held a conference on the subleet,
at which the Mayor asked if the Auditor
would allow the claims if they were with

The Labor Council's
Pointed Letter.
â â¦â
OLD LAWS STILL IN EFFECT
â â¦
A CONTRACT LABORER IS PRAC
TICALLY A SLAVE.
Many Matters of Importance Dis
cussed at the Regular "Weekly
Meeting of the Council
Last Night.
â¢
Recent press reports have brought to
light the fact that Hawaiian planters have
been making contracts with laborers ln
the north of Italy to -work on the planta
tions in the Islands. From recent court de
cisions it appears that laborers on these
plantations are still under the old Ha
waiian laws, or, in other words, a con
tracting laborer practically sells himself
Into slavery for a period covering the
time of his contract. The San Francisco
Labor Council has taken full cognizance
of this, and accordingly instructed its sec
retary* to communicate with the proper
authorities in Italy. Secretary Rosenberg
lias prepared a letter, which will be sent
to Humbert, King of Italy, Pope Leo, the
Italian newspapers and the labor organi
zations of that country, the substance of
which is as follows:
In 1897 an attempt was made to lure
California workmen to Hawaii, but when
the labor laws of that country were pub
lished by the San Francisco Federation of
Trades not one worklngman responded.
During the days of the fight for annexa
tion the representatives of the planters
promised that the objectionable laws
would be repealed, but their promises
have not been kept. A recent decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of Robert
Robertson vs. Barry Baldwin et als. was
to the effect that contracts entered into,
whether voluntary or involuntary, could
at no time become involuntary, and the
protection of the thirteenth amendment
could not be claimed. The letter con
cludes:
And bo to-day the American flag floats over
territory where overseers with whip in hand
urge on the tollers In the cane field, to harder
labor Once In Hawaii under contract to la
bor there is no escape, us you readily see by
the lose, report.
In conclusion I want to state that the press
reports some time ago gave it that the Italian
Government bad forbidden the wholesale
emigration of its subjects to Hawaii. Now
the reports state that the objection had been
withdrawn and that the laborers would come

THE DEATH OF

Sudden Demise of A.

FOUND DYING BY OFFICERS
â â
HAD WARRANT CHARGING HIM
WITH INSANITY.

â¢ '-
Mysterious death has robbed the insane
asylum of a prospective victim and Cap
tain Gillin of the Seventeenth-street Sta
tion is now endeavoring to dispel the
doubt that surrounds the cause of the sud
den demise of A. C. A. Boysen, the pro
prietor of a grocery store at the corner
of Twenty-ninth and Sanchez streets.
Boysen was discovered lying in a pool of
blood on the floor of the little room in the
rear of tho store by the officers who went
to serve the warrant charging him with
insanity, at 6:20 last evening. A moment
later, even while the officers stood over
him, warrant ln hand, the old grocer
breathed his last.
Boysen was a native of Norway, 56
years old and had been in business in the
same neighborhood for more than twenty
seven years. The circumstances of his
death were so peculiar that John B. An
derson, until recently Boysen's partner,
and the flrst to give an Intimation of the
impending tragedy, was taken to the Sev
enteenth-street Station and locked up
pending a further investigation. Appar
ently Boysen's death was caused by a
hemorrhage, but an abrasion on the side
of the head and the peculiar actions of
Anderson convinced Captain Gillin that
there might be something wrong and he
decided to take no chances.
Several months ago Boysen and Ander
son concluded to dissolve partnership.
Boysen retained the grocery business and
the building in which it was located and
Anderson took three cottages in the
neighborhood which were owned by them
jointly. Some property owned by the two
in Berkeley was not divided. Anderson
continued to work around the store. A
week ago Tuesday, according to his story,
he returned from delivering some gro
ceries and found Boysen lying on the bed
ln his room unconscious. He notified Dr.
Baumeister, who. soon restored the suf
ferer to his normal condition. Anderson
says he had noticed for some time that
his former partner had been acting pe
culiarly and asked the doctor what had
best be done. The doctor advised him to
notify Boysen's creditors. Anderson went
to G. H. Umbsen & Co. for advice as that
Arm had acted as the agents for the firm
for ten years.
As a result H. P. Umbsen was yester
day appointed guardian for Boysen by
Judge Troutt on the testimony of Ander
son. Anderson returned to the store at
about 3 o'clock to find Boysen lying on
the floor of his bedroom. He called to
him and Boysen answered and then
seemed to drop off to sleep again. Ander
son hastened down to Umbsen's office and
informed him that Boysen had one of his
"spells" and returned to the store, arriv
ing there at 4:30. He did not go to the
room again but could hear the old man
breathing hard and concluded he was
asleep.
After Anderson's visit Umbsen secured
a warrant charging Boysen with being in
sane and went to the Seventeenth Street
Police Station to get some one to serve
it. Captain Gillin detailed Officers Bode
and Rottanzl for the duty, and they left
the station with Umbsen.
Arriving at the store Anderson was told
to notify Boysen that he was wanted. As
he could not arouse him by rapping on
the door, Mr. Umbsen pushed his way
into the room, followed by the officers.
Boysen was lying there motionless, face
down, on the floor in a pool of blond, but
his heart was still beating. Officer Bode
ordered Anderson to send for a doctor,
but when Dr. Baumeister arrived the man
was dead. The Coroner was then notified
and the body taken to the Morgue. Cor
SHE WILL WED A
CAVALRY OFFICER
THE announcement of the engagement of First Lieutenant John O'Shea.
Troop L, Fourth United Slates Cavalry, to Miss Lou Holcomb of this
city was made public yesterday. The many friends of the two young
people were taken completely by surprise, but the announcement creat
ed a great deal of pleasure ai.d congratulations were showered upon
them. There is a very pretty little romance in connection with the engage
ment. Lieutenant O'Shea, who was recently promoted from the Seventh Cav
alry, came to San Francisco last fall. H e met Miss Holcomb at a "hop"'
given at the Presidio, and it was the old story of love at first sight. The
young officer was then under orders to go to the Philippines, but he lost no
time in pressing his suit, with such success that when he sailed he took with
him the heart and hand of his lady love. - ;~. '
Lieutenant O'Shea was in charge of the Tacoma that took the first assign
ment of horses and mules to Manila. He accomplished the trip successfully
without losing an animal. It was the flrst experiment made by this Govern
ment in the transportation of animals such a long distance, and its success
ful accomplishment speaks much for the efficiency of the young officer. Lieu
tenant O'Shea is a native of Ireland. He entered the army fourteen years
ago as a private and has seen service in every branch of the army. He .won
his shoulder straps by competitive examination and is a graduate Of the
Cavalry School, at Fort Leavenworth. He Is considered one of the best posted
officers on military detail in the army.
Miss Holcomb ls a native daughter, her home being In Oakland, although
at present she is living with her sister at the Colonial Hotel. She is a decided
brunette, with beautiful eyes and a petite stature. Among her friends she is
noted for her charm of manner and many personal accomplishments. She has
been a decided belle in social circles for several seasons.
oner Hill expressed the opinion that death
was caused by a hemorrhape. It is
thought that the abrasion may have been
caused by striking the side of the bed
when he fell, but the fact that Anderson
should tramp all over town after discov
ering the condition of the grocer without
taking the trouble to send for a doctor
tuts him in a bad light, and until Captain
Gillin is satisfied, that he is telling the
truth he will occupy a cell.
Last night Captain Gillin detailed De
tectives Fitzgerald, and Graham and Of
ficer Bode on the case, and they will con
tinue their investigations to-day.

ThjE BERKELEY PRESIDENCY.
THE settlement of the presidency of the Univer
sity of California is perhaps in sight and perhaps
not. The election of Professor Wheeler has not
taken place. The Regents have nominated him. but
whether he elects to come depends upon the result of
his observations on the spot. We have already re
ferred to the burden of political control that is upon
State universities. That this burden has long
been an incubus upon Berkeley is no secret.
There are long-standing dissensions in the fac
ulty and feuds among the Regents. These
have been the upper and nether millstones be
tween which four presidents have been triturated b
yond endurance. No man is anxious to make the fifth
of the list. No scholar of the required standing will
be willing to serve as a sort of steam gauge to register
the pressure on the political boiler that runs the in
stitution. The president must be president, if peace
and progress are to characterize the future of the uni
versity. He must be president as Jordan is at Stan
ford, where his splendid personality and power, his
learning, joined to the finest sense of justice and his
faultless judgment of men, have gathered around him
a faculty of matchless workers, who are content to
depend for their future upon the fact that they were
with Jordan at Stanford.
President Andrew D. White of Cornell, now repre
senting his country in the Peace Conference at The
Hague and settled as our Embassador to Germany, in
his great work on the conflict between theology and
science, describing the difficulties of Agassiz in giving
up the theory of special creations, compliments the
great naturalist for that his influence, his habits of
observation and deduction, gave to the world Jordan,
his student, not to follow his theories, but to aid in the
proof of other hypotheses by the use of his methods.
This is a statement merely of the tolerance that must
lule the republic of letters. It rules at 'Stanford,
where the sweet spirit of science has put dogmatism
out of the door.
Under the system there no injustice such as has
cursed professional life at Berkeley can occur. If
Professor Wheeler come to Berkeley the Regents
should bring him as president, not as the puppet of
an academic senate, which, though not created by any
law of the institution, exists, with the power to or
ganize cabals among the Regents and undermine
any professor or president marked for a fall.
As Stanford has risen through the harmony brought
about by the headship of a great intellectual personal
ity, Berkeley has fallen. In the dark days at Stan
ford, when the endowment was in danger and the
running funds were tied up by the courts. President
Jordan patiently ate his crust with the janitor, and be
tween those two extremes professors and tutors went
to their unrecompensed duties with smiling faces and
perfect faith in the future.
At Berkeley the difference in methods, the stand- j
ing deficit in funds, the tendency to faction and feud,
make one man grudge the butter on another's bread',
and misfortune is supported with impatience. Make ;
the president president, and watch for the desirable j
change which will come.
United States District Judge de Haven has just ren- j
dered a decision in a bankruptcy proceeding' to the '
effect that bakers' tools arc exempt from the attacks !
of creditors. He probably holds that the "dough"
should satisfy them. >

Nothing is created that has not its place in the

There is either a curious flagpole or a badly mixed
metaphor over in Oakland. A correspondent, speak

BUBONIC POLITICS.
THE CALL had hoped and almost expected that
provision would lie made for a representative
municipal convention of the Republican party
this year; through which a ticket would be presented,
I composed of such independent, strong and unexcep
tionable Republicans that success at the polls would j
be overwhelming. It seemed that, with the new plan j
of municipal government, to take effect January i,
iqoo. and with the transparent and exaggerated dema
gog-ism of Mayor Phelan and his most blatant sup- j
porters, a better opportunity to secure a sound busi- j
! ness administration of local affairs under Republican ;
! auspices could not have been devised.
The disappointment we have so far experienced pro
duces mingled regret and indignation. It is apparent
that the treacherous railroad attempt to turn the
municipality and the State over to the fusion Dem- 'â¢
ocracy, which originated last year, is under a full head
of steam. The action of the Republican County Com- i
mittee on Thursday night in adopting the blanket
plan of electing 306 delegates to a municipal conven- i
tion demonstrates the ascendency in that body of the
corrupt and monopolistic elements that the clean, in
telligent and manly Republicans of San Francisco are ;
pledged to repudiate. The dissolute political associa
tion between William F. Herrin and Daniel M.
Burns, of which Kelly and Crimmins are the figure
heads", took absolute control of the committee and j
impudently notified the community that in the muni- !
cipal contest the representative principle is to be ig
nored and that Republican citizens must smash party j
machinery or vote according to monopolistic preor- I
dination.
There are eighteen Assembly districts in San Fran
cisco. It had been well understood that a convention
of 306 members, with seventeen elected from each of
these districts, would not only be completely repre
sentative but would concentrate uncontrollable intelli
gence and judgment. William F. Herrin, Daniel M.
Burns and the entire Kelly and Crimmins contingent
have no machinery that would enable them to carry
eighteen separated primaries, all occurring at one j
time. -That plan, generally acquiesced in by the pub
lic and by the press, would have produced an assem- i
blage of nominating Republicans unsurpassed in our j
municipal history. It would have placed before the
voting mass of our people the American conception
of popular sovereignty as contrasted with the auto
cratic methods of Mr. Phelan and his Committee of
One Hundred.
But the viperous renegades who offer their party and
their country for sale day by day would rather die
from their own stings than submit to any rule of or- i
dinary decency, and they could not survive a dose 'of :
genuine Americanism. Therefore, they combined
their corrupt experience in a deliberate effort to re- i
duce the Republican voters of the city to the grade :
of automatons or puppets. By selecting seventeen i
men in each Assembly district, aggregating them into i
one ticket of 306 men and compelling every citizen
who participates in the primary to vote for the whole
number, they multiply the power of their own de
graded tools and overcome the controlling repre- ;
sentative influence of intelligence and of respectability.
It is in this way they propose to swamp education
and independence in the tenderloin and to establish
the local omnipotence of the vilest crew of traitorous
corruptionists that ever infested a metropolis contain
ing schools, churches and homes.
The Huntington monopoly and all the other vil- \
lainies associated with it are bent upon emasculating
the new charter if they cannot judicially destrdy it. Their
interference with Republican politics is one of their
methods of procedure. But they also have revenges
to gratify for the defeats they have recently sustained.
"Rule or ruin" is their undeviating principle. They
not merely claim their possession of a local and a '
State despotism, but they want the public to perceive
and acknowledge the claim and live in scared obedi
ence to their demands.
The omens are not propitious for political rascality
this year. The Call has expressed its strong desire for
a sound Republican administration of the municipal
government. In this respect it has not stood alone. '
It now* again warns the corruptionists, who appro
priately retained J. M. Chretien in their loving em
brace, that it will not indorse this blanket scheme to !
turn the Republican organization over to Mr. Hun
tington, William F. Herrin, Daniel M. Burns and
Crimmins and Kelly, and that it will not support but j
will vigorously oppose each and every nomination
that carries the taint or emits the odor of the railroad
monopoly, the boss or the machine.
We trust that some plan may yet be found to secure
a respectable convention and a sound Republican
ticket, and that the treachery of the railroad to the
Republican party may be frustrated. But time is
short and everything has an end. What is to be done
should be accomplished quickly..
STUDYING THE COAST.
WHILE the Association of American Agricul
tural Colleges and Experiment Stations is in
convention in this city, and the National Asso
ciation of Editors is in convention at Portland, thou
sands of members of the National Educational Asso
ciation are on their way to the grand assembly to be
held at Los Angeles. It is evidently a Pacific Coast
year for national conventions, and every- portion of
the coast is to be studied by observant men.
In his response to the address of welcome on the I
opening of the convention on Wednesday President j
Armsby, speaking for the Colleges and Experiment
Stations, said: "We have heard much of California,
the Empire State of the West, and we anticipate with
pleasure, our inspection of it. We accept your wel
come in our representative capacity, for we have
come to sec and examine your resources, of which j
we have heard so much. What little we have seen of
the State has been far beyond our expectations, and i
I can assure you that we shall make known through- |
out the country the things that we find here."
In that statement is summed up in a brief but com
prehensive way the motive which has impelled' our
Eastern visitors to come to this remote portion of the
Union for the purpose of holding conventions. The
routine work of the meetings, the reading of papers
and the discussion of various problems, could be per
formed in Eastern cities as well as here. It was,
therefore, not solely for the purpose of holding con
ventions, but for the purpose of studying Pacific
Coast conditions, that the editors have met at Port
land, the agriculturists in this city, ana the educators
will 'meet in Los Angeles.
Our benefits from the study of such bodies of men
as are now gathered on the coast are certain to be
great. Even the language of exaggeration when ap
plied to certain special features of the Pacific Coast
and its resources has fallen short of the real great
ness and variety of the natural richness of the land.
The more carefully our conditions are studied from
Puget Sound to San Diego Bay, and the more
scientifically accurate are the reports given of them,
the more impressive will their magnitude appear
and the more attractive will they be to the world.
We ask neither of the editors at Portland, the edu
cators at Los Angeles, nor of the agricultural experts
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1899.
in this city anything more than President Armsby has
promised. If the visitors will study the coast from
the standpoint of that department of knowledge in
which they are experts, and make known throughout
the country the things they find here, we shall be
satisfied. We shall indeed have occasion to give them
thanks for their study and for their reports.
CALIFORNIA BUILDING MATERIAL.
NO little gratification has been felt over the an
nouncement from Washington that the Govern
ment, in awarding the contract for the stone
work of the new postoffice building, has stipulated
that the material used shall be Raymond granite. We
are thus saved from the absurdity, at one time threat
ened, of having stone brought from the East for the
construction of a public building in California.
It appears that considerable efforts were required to
induce the Treasury officials to make the stipulation
in' favor of Californian material. It may have been
that the suggestion of the use of Eastern stone was
due to a desire to throw the patronage of the depart
ment to certain firms in the East, but it is more likely
to have arisen from a belief that California lacked
stone suitable for the purpose. No amount of ignor
ance of the resources of this State or of the Pacific
Coast generally need surprise us on the part of the
officials at Washington. Time and again our inter
ests have been sacrificed under circumstances which
force the conclusion that the sacrifice was made
through sheer lack of knowledge of the interests at
stake.
The whole course of the history of the postoffice j
building shows how indifferent Washington is to !
California. At every step in the proceedings there j
has been a fight, and we have obtained the new cdi- !
fice not so much by a grant from the Government as
by a contest. It is ttue that for the delay in beginning I
the work the Government was not wholly to blame,
inasmuch as a strong opposition to the site selected \
was developed here, and warnings were sent to Wash
ington that the site was unsafe. Even after that fac- !
tious fight was ended, however, the delay continued, j
and it was not until earnest and repeated petitions j
were made on behalf of the people that the work of
construction began. j
At last everything seems to be moving in a satis- ''
factory way. It is indeed to be regretted that the j
contract for the stone work was not awarded to a
California firm, but that is a minor matter. The '
stipulation for the use of stone from our quarries j
means not only that much of patronage given to a
local industry, but shows that Washington has learned
that California possesses something besides gold !
mines and orchards. The new building will serve as I
an advertisement of the value of our quarries, and it j
may be that we shall ere long be called upon to ship
granite to the East.
PROBLEMS FOR THE PUBLIC.
PRESIDENT MACCABE of the National Edi
torial Association, in delivering the opening!
address at the, convention in- Portland, set forth
two important problems for the consideration of the !
association. The first is the desirability of bringing
about an equitable adjustment of laws affecting
journalism throughout the Union, and the second
that of ridding the public from the nuisance of ille- I
gitimate advertising. Each of these problems is a
serious one, and it is certainly time a solution should I
be undertaken.
The laws affecting newspapers are not only conflict
ing in different States, but are in many States so unfair
as to be virtually unfit for enforcement. We have in
this State two instances of such laws enacted at the
last session of the Legislatureâ one known as the
anti-cartoon act and the other as the signature act
neither of which has thus far served any other pur
pose than that of showing how much like wild rams
some legislators can be, and how much like a stray !
sheep a Governor can be who follows the lead of
such rams.
Laws of such a nature, varying with the freaks of
different State Legislatures,. while seemingly harmless
so long as they are unenforced, none the less consti
tute a heavy handicap upon the smaller newspapers I
of the community. Journals sufficiently rich and
powerful to be able to fight libel suits or other suits
brought for spite or coin can afford to ignore most !
of the vicious laws, but upon the country press, that !
serves as the guard and the champion of the common
rights of that great mass of the American people
living in comparatively small communities, such laws
are serious interferences with the performance of the !
full duty of an independent editor. It is for the gen- j
eral good, therefore, that such acts should be re- i
pealed and just laws enacted in their place.
The evils of illegitimate advertising, to which
President MacCabe referred, are becoming more por- '
tentous every day. In New York, where large cor
porations, chartered for other purposes, have engaged
extensively in advertising, a fight has been already
begun to protect the public from their exactions.
Among the corporations which are the most con
spicuous offenders in that way are railroads. None
of them are chartered to do an advertising business,
and yet all of them are more or less engaged in it.
Neither of these problems will be easy to solve.
The evil in each case springs from what seems a
natural depravity. Who can set a limit to the folly
of legislators? Who can fix bounds to the grasping
of corporations greedy for illegitimate gains? Diffi
cult, however, as the problems and the evils are, it
is worth while to grapple with them. If the editors
now in convention can devise any well-considered
means to remedy the wrong the public will cordially
support it.
King Leopold of Belgium can do nothing less than
decorate his "Old Probabilities." The weather sharp
to the King has undoubtedly saved that monarch his
job. Knowing the antipathy of the Socialists of his
native land to water in any form, he displayed the
signal for rain. Intending revolutionists, seeing it.
scattered in all directions. The beginning of one rain
may be said to have saved the end of another.

â , â
The transports Ohio and Newport,
bringing the Second Oregon Volunteers,
which left Manila early last month, are
expected to arrive in this port not later
than Monday night, possibly sooner, and
preparations are now under way to give
the returning YVebfoot soldiers a rousing
welcome. The instant the transports are
sighted by the special lookout stationed
at Point Reyes, the big siren at the Eu
reka Planing Mills will be turned loose
to carry the news to the citizens of San
Francisco and the surrounding country.
As the transports cannot reach the inner
harbor for two or three hours the various
reception committees will thus be given
ample time in which to get to the tugs
and launches that have been engaged for
the occasion.
Mayor Phelan, as the representative of
the city, will steam down the bay on the
Harbor Commissioners' tug Governor
Markham, and he will be accompanied by
Adjutant General Seamans, Major Gen
eral Dickinson and such other members
0- the Governor's staff as may be in the

Native Sons, composed of Messrs. Lewis
Bvington, Henry Lunstedt, Judge F. 11.

Shea, James I. Dockery. Mark A. Devine,
Frank H. Mills and George Dryden.
The Governor of Oregon may not reach
San Francisco until alter the arrival of
the transports. According to present
plans the troops will be debarked and
marched up Market street to the City
Hall and back to the water front Imme- !
diately upon their arrival, In order to give
an enthusiastic public tin opportunity to
express their appreciation of the soldiers
at close range. "When the signal an
nouncing the sighting of the transports
is given the scores of mills and factories
along the water front will take up the
tune and their whistles will shriek the
welcome tidings broadcast over the land.
The Harbor Commissioners will give the
ladies of the Red Cross the use of the â 
wailing rooms and corridors in the Ferry i
building when the soldiers arrive and the
ladies are busy preparing fruit, flowers j
and various delicacies for the expected
heroes.
According to the official reports received

Â»
Finance Committee Holds Up a Bill
of Dunham, Carrigan & Hay
den for Investiga
tion.
a
Protests against the reduced apportion
ments for municipal departments are be
j ginning to pour in upon the Supervisors.
i and the members are anticipating an ex
| ceedingly uncomfortable time of it dur
i ing the next few weeks. An inkling of
what may be expected in the future was
given at the meeting of the Finance Com
mittee yesterday afternoon.
The first to appear was Assistant Dis
trict Attorney E. S. Salomon, who asked
the committee to Increase the salary of tha
stenographer and typewriter employed by
District Attorney Murphy. Salomon ex
plained that he appeared on behalf of his
chief, who thought that the stenograph
er's present salary of $50 was entirely in
adequate, as he had to work long over
time to handle the business of the office.
Chairman Perrault explained that being
pledged to the dollar limit he did not see
how It was possible to allow the stenog
rapher any more pay. "Tell Judge Mur
phy," concluded Perrault. "to see the
Merchants' Association or Mayor Phelan.
Perhaps they can figure out how your
stenographer can get more money under
the dollar limit. We can l."
Next a communication was read from
the Free Library Trustees, setting forth
many reasons why the library appropria
tion should not be reduced to the $50,000
allowed by the committee's estimate. It
was placed on file. .".'-'- _ . ,_,.
Then the Board of Health got in with
a written protest against the financial
slashing it. gets, and asking that a time
be set when the members of the board
may appear before the committee and
personally enter a protest. As it waa evi
dent that the Board of Health intends to
make a vigorous fight against the reduc
tion, it was decided to give the members
a hearing next Tuesday evening at 7:30
o'clock.
Clerk Russell was instructed to send out
notices to those who have filed protests
against their assessments that the Su
pervisors will meet as a Board of Equal
ization at 10 a. m., Tuesday, and continue
in daily session until all protests are acted
upon.
The committee reported in favor of re
questing the Assessor to inform the board
as to the amount of assessable property
upon which the board may estimate with
out any uncertainty the amount of the
levy to be raised by the board on the
third Monday in September. 1899, so that
sufficient revenue may be provided for the
support and maintenance of the several
departments for the fiscal year 1599-1900,
and in compliance with the pledge exacted
from the members of the board.
The charges of extreme favoritism in
the purchase of supplies for the Fire De
partment cropped up again when a bill
from Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden wan
presented to the committee. Chairman
Perrault announced that of the fifty itema
in the bill only five were included in the
contract, the others being bought in open
market. He cited carriage bolts, which
were purchased from that firm at 3 cents
each, while the contract price was 96
cents a hundred. . -
"What's that?" demanded Collins.
"Why, that's a raise of $2 05 per hundred
over "the contract price."
"Here are the figures in the bill; they
speak for themselves," replied Perrault.
"The best thing for us to do is to hold
this bill up." The other members fully
agreed with him. and the chances are
good for the heads of the Fire Depart
ment and Dunham. Carrigan & Hayden
being called upon to do some explaining.JUDGE MORROW SCORES

be reimbursed their expenses, and stated
the reasons therefor.
The court referred to the action of the
Board of Railroad Commissioners in pass
ing a resolution last April deprecating the
litigation and reciting that it was advisa
ble to remove the cause thereof by re
pealing the original resolutions for re
ducing rate?, against the enforcement of
which an injunction had been Issued; and
directing their counsel to obtain a dis
missal of the case without costs to either
party: that soon after the passage of this
resolution the Attorney General and spe
cial counsel for the board had appeared in
court and moved for a dismissal of the
case without costs to either party, at the
same time presenting to the court a copy
of the resolution of the board authorizing
such action; that the court had denied
this motion upon the ground that the
Commissioners, as defendants in the suit,
had no right to move for its dismissal, but
stated at the time of so deciding that
the complainant had the right if
it saw fit to exercise it; that
Thereafter the complainant, following
the lines indicated by the court, had
filed a dismissal of the case and procured
a final decree of dismissal without asking
for its costs; that after this action was
taker, the Board of Railroad Commission
ers had come in and made a motion to
have the decree amended so as to allow
them their costs.
This the court designated as "rather a
remarkable proceeding" ln view of the
fact that the Commissioners had initiated
the dismissal of the action and had vol
untarily moved for the same, waiving
any claim to costs. The court held that
by so doing they were estopped from now
complaining because a decree of dismis
sal had been entered without allowing
costs to either party: that it was the duly
of the court, sitting as a chancellor, to re
gard the whole proceedings and ascertain
the real intention of the parties, and from
all that had taken place the court must
conclude that the Railroad Commission
ers had regarded the resolutions against
which the injunction ran as the real
cause of the Ration and were seeking
to remove that cause by repealing then*.
and that they aimed to do away with tho
grounds of action on behalf of the rail
road company by rescinding the resolu
tions complained of; that the complainant,
the railroad company, had the right to
regard their action as taken in good
faith and to act upon it.
The court intimated that it was rather
a contradictory position for counsel of the
Railroad Commissioners to come into
court first and ask for a dismissal of the
case without costs and then after their
request had been acceded to by the other
side to change their tactics and make a
subsequent application for costs upon an
entirely different theory from that upon
which they had first proceeded; that such
Inconsistency would not be regarded with
favor in a court of equity and th* Com
missioners would be obliged to abide by
the consequences following. their firs po
sition, the result being that their motion
must be denied and they should recover no
costs in the action.
It follows from this decision that the
Commissioners not only failed to get any
previous costs incurred in the suit but
they will be also obliged to pay the costs
of their motion, Including reporter' fees
and the like, which will be an additional
tax upon the State treasury.
The following is the full text of Judge
Morrow's decision:
On the Sth day of May, 1889, the At
!torney General of the State and spe
cial counsel for the respondent, the
Board of Railroad Commissioners of
this State, made a motion for the dis
missal of this case upon each party
to the action paying its own costs in
curred In the case. The motion was
based upon certain resolutions adopted
by the respondent board on the 24".h
day of April. 1899 whereby certain pre
vious resolutions adopted by the
board on the 12th and 13th days of
September. 1895; relating to freight and
grain rates on complainant's system
of railroads in California, were re
scinded, annulled, vacated, set aside
and repealed.
It was recited in the resolutions of
April 24, 1899, that the respondent
board deemed it expedient and for the
best interests of the people of the
State that said litigation be not fur
ther maintained or carried on, but that
the same be discontinued: and, the
board being advised and of the opin
ion that the best and only method
of stopping said litigation was by re
moving the cause of it. It was there
fore resolved that the resolutions of
September _ and 13. 1895, should be re
pealed.
In other words, the respondent, the
Board of Railroad Commissioners,
came into this court and asked for
a dismissal of this case upon the re
cital that they had repealed th*- reso
lutions relating to freight charges
which had led to the institution of the
suit. The court denied the motion as
then made, because there were certain
recitals contained In those resolutions
which it appeared were not In con
formity with the record in the case.
It was also suggested by the court
at that time that this motion, as the
case then stood, should properly come
from the complainant in the action.
Upon this suggestion of the court,
complainant's counsel made a motion
for the dismissal of the cause on the
_9th day of May, 1899. This motion
was accompanied by a copy of the
proceedings of the respondent board
as set forth in the motion made there
tofore by the respondent as to the re
peal of the resolutions adopted by it
in September, 1595. Upon that motion
of complainant, a decree was entered
by the court that the cause be dis
missed. The decree was silent as to
costs. The complainant did not ask
for such a decree, presumably for the
reason that the motion was made on
the proceedings had by the respond
ent board and upon the previous mo
tion made by the Attorney General
specifically providing that each party
should pay its own costs incurred.
Thereafter, on the 24th day of May.
1899, the Attorney General of the State
and the special counsel representing |
the respondent board filed a motion to
so amend the decree as to award to the
respondent board as against the com
plainant all the costs by It incurred
in the action. On the same day the
complainant filed a similar motion.
The question before the court now is
as to whether the decree so made by
the court should be amended so as to
provide for ihe payment of costs, and
if bo, which party should be required
to pay these costs.
The respondent board in this case
supports its motion for an amendment
of the decree providing for the allow
ance of costs to it upon the ground
that it has been successful In this
suit. This â¢ aim Is based upon the
contention that the resolutions adopt
ed by the respondent board on Sep- â 
tember 12 and 13, 1895. w.ere merely pre
liminary to a reduction of freight
charges upon the lines of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, and that effective
action of the board was not taken until
September 17. 1895. when a schedule of j
rates was adopted by the board, and J
that what the board did on the 24th
day of April, 1599, was to repeal these
preliminary resolutions adopted by the
Railroad Commission on September 12
and IS. 1595, while the schedule of rates
adopted on September 17, 1896, was not
disturbed; that the real action of the
Board of Railroad Commissioners was
contained in the resolution of Septem
ber 17, 1895, relating to the schedule of
rates, and that the preliminary resolu
tions of the 32th and 13th of Septem
ber. 1595, were in effect harmless.
This proposition is remarkable, in
view of the record I rind in this case.
The controversy in this court appears
to have covered this whole question
as to the scope of the original resolu
tions and their relation to the schedule
of rates. The relation of these resolu
tions of September 12th and 13th to the
schedule of rates adopted on Septem
ber 17 appears to have been fully* con
sidered by the court, and upon the de
cision of the motion for Injunction
Judge Mi Kenna pointed out. if not by
express language by implication, that
It was the province of the court to
arrest the uplifted arm before the blow
should be struck.
This was the theory of the interposi
tion of the court with respect to the
8 per centum resolution relating to
grain rates, after the threatened
action of the respondent board, when
it adopted its resolution on the 12th
and 13th of September, 1895, and before
the schedule of rates had been put In
operation. Judge McKenna indicated
in his opinion that the time for the
court to act in such a matter was
after the threat and before the blow*
fell: that if the complainant had wait
ed until after the schedule of rates
had been put in operation, then some
other action would have been nec
essary.
With respect to the 25 per centum
resolution, it appeared that the com
plainant had been premature in its
application for an injunction, because
the Railroad Commissioners had not
yet reached the point of action where
the court could properly arrest the
proceedings of the board.
Referring to this resolution, â  Judge
McKei na quoted from the argument
of Judge Hayne as follows: "They
say (the commission) that they do not
consider it binding, and are not going
to do anything without further con
sideration, which, of course, may lead
to very different results. The service,
if it is to be made, has to be made by
their order, by their authority; and
they have not yet even made up the
schedule which is to be served. They
come here, high officers of State, and
swear they are not going to take the
action without a further, full, free,
and fair Investigation."
Judge McKenna then said: "I am
disposed to accept this as true and
sincere. Indeed. I do not know how
not to do so, regarding them, as they
must be regarded, as truthful; nor do
I care to risk the slightest embar
rassment to them as officers in any
proper investigation of the complain
ant, or any of its constituent roads,
the results* of which cannot be put
into force, even If it was desirable to.
except in a direct and open way. and
the detriment of which, if any, can
be arrested before it fall."
The respondents' contention that
there was no effective action in he
resolutions of September 12 and 13 is
clearly contrary to what the court
determined, as well as contrary to the
argument of counsel. The whole case,
from the beginning to the end, outlines
a procedure in a court of equity on
the part of the complainant to arrest
the action of the respondents before
their action should be beyond the
reach of the court. Put if it be said
that these preliminary resolutions were
ineffective and harmless and that the
real assault was in this resolution of
September 17, 1895. which latter reso
lution has not been disturbed by the
board, then, in my judgment, upon
that theory of the proceedings the re
spondent board is estopped to make
any such claim; they will not he per
mitted, after all this controversy, to
say that the real conflict md the real
action of the board were involved in
this resolution of September 17, 1895,
and that this resolution still remains
as evidence that the respondents have
been successful in this suit.
It is not for this court, upon a mo
tion of this character, to determine
who has been successful In a suit. The
decree or judgment speaks for Itself
upon such a question, but when a court
is called upon to modify a degree it
will not be misled by the mere form of
the proceedings which have brought
the case to a conclusion. A court of
equity is never to be deceived by mere
form, nor will it allow parties to come
into court one day contending for sup
posed rights upon one theory and the
next lay shift their position and say
there is no controversy upon that prop
osition at all. but It is somewhere else
and with respect to questions not be
fore considered.
In my opinion, therefore, the respon
dent board is estopped to say now that
that there was nothing in the prelim
inary resolutions and that they were
passed for no purpose or by Inadver
tence. The Attorney General sug
gested, by way of illustration, that the
preliminary resolutions, in their rela
tion to the resolution of September 17,
were of the same character as where
a Legislature composed of two boused
passes a bill in each house and both
bills become laws by the action of the
houses at different dates, the two bills
being identical, and afterward, upon
examination, the two laws are
found upon the statute book and to be
identical, and the Legislature then re
peals one of them as useless and as a
mere Incumbrance on the books.
The court cannot look at these reso
lutions in that light. I do not hay
what the court might have determined
with respect to these resolutions when
the cause was still in controversy and
under consideration. But now that it
is over, and the respondents have by
solemn resolution declared that their
purpose on April 24 of this year was to
remove the cause of complaint, they
cannot now claim that there was no
cause of complaint, or if there *vas
that they did not intend to remove it.
They cannot In one breath say that,
being advised and of the opinion that
the best and only method of stopping
the litigation was to remove the cause
thereof, and to that end they will re
peal certain resolutions, and in an
other say that they did not remove
anything by the latter resolution, or
that there was nothing in fact to re
move.
In any event respondents cannot re
cover costs upon any such theory of
the proceedings of the Board of Rail
road Commissioners.
The complainant, in making its mo
tion to dismiss, made the resolutions
of the respondent board of April 21.
IW. a part of the proceedings. In ef
fect it said: "The Board of Railroad
Commissioners has asked to have this
case dismissed because the resolutions
of September 12 and 13, IW,â the cause
of the litigationâ have been repealed.
The court has said that this motion
ought to come from the complainant.
We accept the suggestion and we make
the motion; we propose to dismiss this
suit. In the resolution it was said that
each party should pay Its costs. We
have accepted that suggestion and
we propose to dismiss it and say noth
ing about the costs." Thereupon tho
cause was dismissed. â¢
Under these circumstances- the court
Ip unable to find anything In this rec
ord to justify a modification of the de
cree, and an award of costs to the
respondents. The motion of the re
spondent board will, therefore, be de
nied.
The complainant has also made a
motion to have costs awarded to it.
That motion was noticed after the re
spondents had given notice of their mo
tion. The complainant appears to have
acted upon the theory that if the case
â¢was to be reopened and the matter of
costs considered, it was as much en
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1599.
titled to costs as the respondents..
That is the probable motive that was
behind this motion on the part of com
plainant. The complainant has. how
ever, urged it on the ground that it
appears from the record to he entitled
to costs, and has cited a great many
authorities which would seem to jus
tify the claim. But the court is not
in a position to follow the rules as de
clared in the cases cited. The decree
was entered without costs upon the
motion of complainant. There is
nothing to show that there was any
mistake or inadvertence or oversight
on the part of the complainant in mak
ing this motion. As I have already
indicated, the complainant knew what
it was doing when it dismissed the
case. It did so upon the faith of re
spondents' action that each party was
to pay its own costs. I shall, there
fore, be compelled, under these cir
cumstances, to deny the complainant's
motion for costs.
The decree will stand as it is. with
out modification, and the motions will
be denied.
Mr. Sturtevantâ l ask that an exception
be allowed the respondents to that part
of your Honor's decision denying the re
spondents' motion to have their costs
taxed against the complainant.
Mr. Pillsbury -That being the case, we
reserve an exception to your Honor's
order denying our motion.
The total taxable costs will fall a little
below $10,000. To these costs must be
added counsel fees, which will roll the
sum the State will be required to pay
up to a large figure.
MINNIE ADAMS' DEFENSE.
It Was Taken Up Yesterday Before
Judge Eawlor.
The prosecution in the ease of Mrs. Min
nie Adams, charged with the murder of
her Illegitimate son, John Richard Gray,
was closed yesterday morning. Mrs.
Kenny, who gave Mrs. Adams' daughter
the cape about which considerable has
been said during the trial, was cross-ex
amined, after which the prosecution
rested.
The defense then railed Harrison Tyr
rell, a boy of 10 years, to testify as to the
bottle from which the dead baby drank
the poison. He said that he was playing
"brewery wagon" with his brother, Ed
ward A. Tyrrell, and they were using all
the bottles they could find for the pur
pose. They found a bottle in the sand
similar to the one from which the baby
drank the poison, and the witness be
lieved that such was the bottle. He did
not see any liquid in it, however, and the
stopper was loose, and if not held on
would fall from Its position. The bottle
introduced in evidence as the one from
which the baby drank the poison has a
tight-fitting stopper, so there is a mis
joiner somewhere. The other brother tes
tified to similar facts, after which the
case went over till Monday morning.

ESTATE GETS THE BALANCE.
Result of a Compromise Effected by
the Sutro Railroad Company.
An order was male yesterday by Judge
Troutt allowing a compromise of the va
rious claims presented by the Sutro Rail
road Company against the Sutro estate
and those of the estate presented against
the railroad company. By the terms of
the contract the railroad agrees to pay
the estate $3,861 35 in settlement of the
accounts between them.
In his life Adolph Sutro had various
dealings with the railroad end of his es
tate the rails of the road being laid over
a large portion of his estate, and in ad
dition the company furnished his baths
with steam power and in consequence
many complicated business transactions
resulted. A short time ago the railroad
put in its claim against the estate and
a counter claim was filed t.v the estate.
After the various claims had been looked
over by those managing the railroad and
the estate It was decided that the former
owed the latter the sum named. Hence
the order to compromise without the
formality of a judgment.

journed last night after accomplishing j
much important business. Beginning \
with to-day the delegates of the associa
tion will in their official capacity begin
their Inspection of the State of Califor- j

ls shown by the fact that the delegates
are to be taken all over the State with- j
out any expense to themselves. This i
morning the association will inspect the

Wednesday to Oroville. Thursday they
visit the Sacramento Valley and River,
while Friday and Saturday they will
spend in the Santa Clara Valley. Many
points of interest will be inspected and ,

Academy of Sciences Hall shortly before |
l" o'clock by President Armsby. The first
business was the confirmation of the
election of the officers of the different
sections which were made by the sections
on Thursday. The convention confirmed
unanimously all of the officers chosen.
E. H. Jenkins of Connecticut Invited the |
association to hold its next annual con
vention at New Haven. Dr. A. C. True
of Washington. D. C. . also spoke In favor
of New Haven. H. E. Stockbridg of !
Florida invited the convention ,to meet
in Jacksonville. This is a slight depart
ure from a recognized custom of the asso
ciation, which has been to hold every
other convention in Washington. D. C.
The matter was referred to the executive
committee.
Henry H. Goodell. chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, moved that a commit
tee be appointed to pass upon the papers
of the various sections for the purpose of
deciding which are suitable for publica
tion in the annual report of the associa
tion. This motion grew out of the dis
cussion of Thursday night. William N.
Liggett of Minnesota, read a paper on !
"Agricultural Education. Practical and
Scientific," in which he dwelt upon the
far-reaching Influences of the Morrill and
Hatch act in securing appropriation of
funds from the national resources to aid
rural Industries. He said that ten years
ago the question of "How are we to edu
cate our farmers?" could not be an
swered, but that only recently had the
problem begun to be solved. Agricultural
science was divided into two classes, he
said. The first was to teach the young '
men how to be better farmers, the sec
ond was the educating of agricultural sci
entists, and the latter he declared was
necessary in order to obtain success in
the first. He strongly advocated the dis
semination by all available means of ag
ricultural science, so that farmers who
can't attend agricultural colleges may be
educated.
Dr. True made a report upon graduate
study at Washington, and. this provoked
a long and general discussion upon the
co-operation of the Department of Agri
culture with the experiment stations.
The committee on nominations brought
in the names of the officers as selected
for the ensuing year. They were all
unanimously elected and are as follows:
President, Joseph B. Stubbs. president of the
University of Nevada.
First vice president. Professor K. W. Hil
gard of the University of California.
Second vice president. Professor J. M. Stone
of Mississippi.
Third vice president. Professor Elmer E.

The section work of the association was j
concluded during the afternoon. The del- I
egates were the guests of the California ;
State Floral Society at a reception held
from 3 to 6 o'clock In the southern dining
room of the Occidental Hotel, .which had
for the occasion been transformed into a j
fairyland of rare and beautiful flowers. j
Professor Wickson of the University of i
California is the president of this society.
and Professor Emory Smith of Stanford :
University the vice president. The ar
rangement of the reception was under the
immediate charge of the following com- I
mittee: Mrs. L. 0. Hodgkins, Mrs. Austin |
Sperry. Mrs. Helen Cross, John Hinkle
and John Henderson. A number of the
members of the society assisted the com
mittee in the arrangement of the floral
display and the reception of the guests.
The members of the association mar
velled at what was shown them In the
floral line. They were lavish iv their
praise of the beautiful flowers, expressing
great curiosity and pleasure at the many
specimens that they had never before seen.
They were all interested In examining the
plants ami asking questions, and the
afternoon was most enjoyably spent. The
floral society placed a beautiful and ex
tensive exhibition before their guests, and
the latter were profuse in expressing their
appreciation of the courtesy shown them
and the pleasure and benefit that they
had derived from it.
At the night session the association
adopted a motion petitioning Congress
that such measures be taken as shall se
cure the delivery of the public documents
to the depository libraries at the earliest
moment. A motion was also adopted in
structing the executive committee to se
cure a place upon the programme of the
National Educational Association of 1900
for the presentation of the scope and mis-
sion of the land grant colleges in our
American system of education.
A paper on "Seed Testing in Its Rela
tion to the Farm Garden," by A. J. Peters,
was read by S. B. Green of Minnesota.
11. H. Goodell of Massachusetts read a
paper on "Principles Underlying the
Formation of an Agricultural Course in
the South," written by Dr. C. E. Coates
of Louisiana.
A set of resolutions was offered by S.
M. Emory of Montana thanking the
Mayor, citizens and press of San Francis
co, and In fact every one who had ex
tended courtesies to them. The conven
tion then adjourned sin die.
CHEMISTS ADJOURN.
They Discuss Pure Food Stand-
arc's and Elect Officers.
The sixteenth annual convention of the
Association of Official Agricultural Chem
ists met for their last day's session in
the Mills building at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. The major portion of the
session was devoted to the discussion of
food standards. This is about the only
business of national importance that the
chemists have considered. The report of
the committee appointed In 1897 to ex
amine Into the feasibility of fixing a set
of pure food standards was received and
discussed. The committee reported that
it had received many reports from the '
sub-committees appointed by it to make
analyses, but that the time had been so
short that it had been unable to formu
late the Ideas.
There are now bills pending in Congress
which have for their object the correc
tion of the misbranding and adulteration
of foods and drugs, both of which bills
are Indorsed by the National Pure Food
and Drug Congress, and the committee
reported that eminent lawyers in Con
gress advised that the association hurry
up its set of standards, so that Congress
might be the better able to pass some
kind of interstate commerce law such as
is needed. The committee hopes to have
Its work prepared ln the near future.
L. P. Voorhees of New Jersey and J.
B. Weems of lowa read papers on "In
secticides" and "Dairy Reports." The
former paper discussed the adulteration
of some of the preparations now in use.
The following officers were elected for
the ensuing year: President, B. W. Kil
gore of North Carolina; vice president,
L. L. Van Slyko of New York, and secre
tary, 11. W. Wiley of Washington. D. C.
The convention then adjourned sine die.

WELL-KNOWN EDUCATOR
SUDDENLY PASSES AWAY
HEART DISEASE CLAIMS MME.
BERTHA ZISKA.
' For Thirty-Five Years She Conducted
an Institution of Learning for
Young Ladies in This City. â¢
Mme. Bertha Marie Louise Ziska, the
well-known educator, died suddenly at 11
o'clock on Thursday night at her home,
1718 Sacramento street. Her death was
the result of heart failure superinduced by
rheumatism, from which she had suffered
for years.
Mme. Ziska was found dead by her
daughter, Mrs. Alice Jennings, who re
turned homo after witnessing the per
formance at the Orpheum. Her mother's
body was still warm, and Its. Rivas and
Anthony were summoned, but they im
mediately announced that Mme. Ziska
was beyond medical aid.
Upon investigation Coroner Hill found
that the rheumatism to which she had
been subject had developed Into heart
trouble, and at the request of Mrs. Jen
nings an inquest in the case was waived.
Mme. Ziska had visited Carlsbad and
other health resorts for relief, but with
out success.
Mme. Ziska was widely known in edu
cational and society circles and her great
experience in America and Europe made
her particularly adapted to the training
of young girls. Her methods, thorough
and progressive as they were, always ob
tained the best results. Deceased war
born in Paris in 1843 and was educated in
Berlin. She successfully passed the teach
ers' examination in the Berlin Gymnasium
before she was 15 years of age, and the
fact that the test for proficiency was very
severe serves to show her special talents.
She was married in New York to Mr.
Ziska, who died some years ago. and she
came to San Francisco at the age of 18.
After a residence of several months she
started a school for young girls. At thai
time South rark was the fashionable resi
dence quarter of the city, and it was there
that she established the Ziska Institute,
and under her able leadership many of so
ciety's fairest daughters have receive 1
their education. Later she removed to
Van Ness avenue and then to Sacramento
street, where the institute has been lo
cated for the past three years. She was
an accomplished linguist, speaking Ger
man, French. Spanish and English flu
ently.
The funeral services, which will be con
ducted by Rev. Dr. Foute. will take place
at the residence this afternoon at 2
o'clock. The remains will be cremated at
the Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
AN OBNOXIOUS ORDINANCE.
Merchants' Association Goes to the
Aid of the Teamsters.
Several times recently the police have J
arrested teamsters for violating a city or- j
dinance which forbids driving along bitu- !
minized streets, other than Market, with
the wheels of the vehicle on one side run- I
ning In the car tracks and the wheels on ;
the other side running on the bitumen. A
year ago the directors of the Merchants' j
Association made an investigation of the
effect of this law and arrived at the con
clusion that it worked an unnecessary
hardship upon the teamsters, in fact, that
it could not be complied with. As soon j
as the merchants found the condition in
which the drivers were placed they sent
to the Street Committee of the Super
visors a communication requesting that |
the ordinance be amended. The obnoxious j
feature of the law was set forth in that j
communication as follows:
We were Informed by the draymen that while
they favored the intent of the ordinance and
would gladly co-operate In any movement which
would preserve the streets, yet they informed
us that it would be Impossible for there to-.obey
it completely except on Market street, for the
reason that on account of the width of the
trucks lt is Impossible to drive trucks en any
street except Market outside of the outer rail
without striking vehicles which might tempo
rarily be standing along the side of the street
near the curb, and that they could not drive
trucks with one wheel between the two rails,
as thai would compel one of the horses to walk
on the rail, upon which it could not secure a
foothold.
It was supposed by the directors of the
association that a just amendment had
been made, but the recent arrests and an
inquiry Into the matter shows that the
objectionable law is still in force. At the
meeting of the directors of the body yes
terday the secretary was directed to call
the attention of the Supervisors to the let
ter of last year and ask that the or
dinance be so amended that it can be com
plied with.
A FOOL'S JOKE.
Mrs. Pragley Loses Her Reason
Through Fright at a Firecracker.
Mrs. Mary. Pragley, a young woman re
elding at 723 Post street, was adjudged
Insane yesterday and committed to the
asylum at Agnews. Mrs. Pragley has
been acting strangely since the Fourth.
On that day some irresponsible idiot threw
a giant firecracker at her feet and the
shock and fright following its explosion,
it is said, unhinged her mind.
Immediately after the "joke" had been
played upon the unfortunate woman she
was removed to her home, but as she
failed to recover her reason she was com
mitted to the asylum.
Single Tax Society.
At Its last regular meeting the Single |
Tax Society elected the following officers
for the ensuing term: President, Stephen :
Potter; vice president, H. F. Dessau; j
financial secretary. Miss Maude E. Dhale; )

GATHER ON SAN
RAFAEL LINKS
Opening Tournament of the Club
Is Well /..tended and proves
Successful.
The first regular club tournament held
on the San Rafael links, on the Ist, 3d
and 4th Insta, was highly successful. The
caddies', children's and ladies' competi
tions were all well filled, while the men's
contests on Independence day excited
much interest. The eighteen-hole handi
cap medal play brought out twenty play
ers, who were paired according to their
strength. The best score for the first
round was 61, "which was made by R. G.
Brown, J. A. Folger and C. P. Eells. In
the second round three well known golf
ersâJ. A. Folger, C. P. Eells and C. P.
disappointed the committee' by
falling to make any returns. Harry Dib
ble.*, who is quite a young player, fur
nished the surprise of the day, by hand
ing in a gross score for the eighteen holes
of 12S, K. G. Brown being second with 12.
and Lieutenant T. G. Roberts third with
130. As Harry Dlbblee received a handi
cap of 27 his net .core of 101 was also the
best. Lieutenant T. G. Roberts being sec
ond with a net score of 118. The prize for [
best gross score was awarded to Harry
Dibblee, and the prize for best net score i
to Lieutenant Roberts. -No particularly
good scores were made, several of the,
members playing decidedly bi low their**!
usual form. C. P. Eells won the driving
contest with a 'clean carry of 172 yards '
i> inches, Lieutenant T. G. Roberts being
second with a drive of ir.'j yards 20 inches.
Ben Holliday made an excellent long drive
of 170 yards, but the ball fell outside the
lateral* lines, und so could not be counted.
In I_< approaching competition Lieuten
ant T. G. Roberts was first with an aver
age distance of _0 feet 3 inches from the
cup for the three best balls out of five .
lofted from a distance of seventy-five .
yards over a six-foot net. R. Gilman .
Brown was second with an rage dis- i
tance of 23 feet 2 inches:
Clement Arnold, a boy golfer, took part
in the men's handicap, but did not play
as he usually does. It is confidently 'X
pected he will develop i_.to .i strong
nlaver.
Dr. J. Dennis Arnold has presented the j
club with red jerseys and green caps to
be worn by the caddies, red and green be- i
ing the club colors. I

is more diversified than that of any of the
local clubs, and has bunkers, barrancas.
water courses and other hazards. The
course wanders in and out among the <
hills behind San Rafael, and it ln the
midst of most picturesque scenery. The
home green Is particularly fine, being 120
feet in diameter, as level as a billiard
table and kept in excellent condition. All

ROUGH WEATHER
FOR TACHTSMEN
ON THEIR CRUISE
Jr\e j^ardy GorintKiarvs Sail jHome ;
From Vallejo Under Double
Reefs.
During the holidays three of the yacht
clubs, the San Franclscos, South Bays .
and Encinals, had cruises to Napa City
on their programmes. Commodore T. L.
Hill's sloop Cygnus, flagship of the San
Franclscos. left her moorings at Sausa
lito about 2 o'clock last Saturday after
noon and went Lip under a light wind to
Vallejo. Between 5 and 11 o'clock that
night the following boats cast anchor at
Valleio: Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop Cygnus,
Secretary E. C. Bartlett's yawl Frolic,

the bridge at about noon. The Corinthian
sloops Cupid and Pride and the Encinal
yachts Frances and iris were also at
Napa. At 10:30 on Monday morning the

.made their moorings.
The Corinthians carried out their annual
July cruise as scheduled. " On Saturday

Sunday Suisun. The citizens of Suisun
welcomed the yachtsmen and invited
them to a luncheon and entertainment
in Native Sons' Hall. On Monday morn
ing four buses took the Corinthians out
for a drive among the orchards. The hos
pitable Suisunites tried hard to keep their
visitors, promising to tow their yachts
down to Vallejo, but the Corinthians
started on their homeward trip about 1
p. m. and anchored at Vallejo for the
night. The following yachts aecom
gl the Corinthian flagship Aeolus to
uisun: The yawl ..returns and the sloops

Suisun Creek. Rough weather was en
countered on the way home from Vallejo, i
almost every boat going down under
reefed Bail. The sloop Clara reached Mc-
Nears first and off Marin Islands dropped
her peak. The sloop Ella, which started â 
out with one reef, put in at McNears i
and took a second reef. The sloop Aeolus
came through under full canvas and '
weathered the storm well.

It begins to look like the "old times"
again around the California circuit, which
will be opened early during the month of
August. The different agricultural soci
eties all have money to burn, but new
men aro at the helm and nobody seems
to know the exact place to apply the.
torch. However, this matter can be easily
adjusted. From the present state of the

Judging from his Denver form, Coney,
the black pacer, the "dark unknown" of
the Keating string, will have to .show
marked Improvement during hiÃ journey
down the line on the green circuit. He
was cranky and erratic, and after making
a "Jimmy" lt took Mcllenry fully a quar
ter of a mile to again get him at his gait.
In his last race at the Colorado metropo
lis the son of McKlnney could have been
distanced had Ed Conley, the driver of
George C, so willed it.
This same Ed Conley is the driver who
will live long in the memory of Book
maker George Rose. Conley Is in the em
ploy of Judge Coburn of Pueblo. But three
years ago Conley had a mare at the Sac
ramento Fair called Nellie W. She took
the opening heat of the 2:26 trot at odds
of 100 to 1, and, as "Rataplan" Higgins
expressed it. made a lemonade stand of
Rose's grandstand book.

string consisted of Lochness, Naplan,

$70, the purchaser getting him for stud
purposes. Racebud was disposed of for

the men from across the bay.
The tournament showed the best and
the most mediocre tennis. The most no
ticeable fact was the small number of
flrst-class players entered. But three of
the men who played on the San Rafael
courts were what might be considered
first class. Eliminate George Whitney
and Sumner and Sam Hardy and the
tournament would have been a second
class affair. Tho Hardys and George
Whitney are some years older than the
other entries, most of whom are students
ln the State academies. In a few years
this tennis material will develop into the
very best of players, and then the Whit
ney's and the Hardys will have to light
for th.ir former exclusive position.
The young tennis athlete who made the
best showing ln the tournament was
Harry Welhe. He played as good a
match against the champion, George
Whitney, as did Sam Hardy. Welhe hai*
improved immensely, handling himself
with more assurance and a riper skill
than in former years. He will enter
Stanford University this fall and will con
tinue bis practice on Palo Alto courts.
With Sam Hardy and Weihe to repre
sent the Cardinal, that college will have
a team the Blue and Gold will find dif
ficulty In defeating. Sumner Hardy may
or may not represent the University of
California. Should he do so, there will
be an Interesting collegiate tennis tourna
ment. â â¢'â â  â '
The usual talk about bringing out an
Eastern batch of champions Is heard at
present. Some of the enthusiasts who
â¢saw George Whitney play in the cham
pionship matches are firm in the belief
that he is the fastest thing on the courts.
If some of the big racket wlelders of the
country can be Induced to come to the
coast in the fall and play -match games
with the local champion all expenses will
be guaranteed them. Whitney and the
Hardys would have an advantage In
meeting Easterners, for they have played
all their life on an asphalt, while the
visitors have been accustomed to the slow
turf court.
George Whitney has won the champion
ship cup twice, as has Sam Hardy. This
will Insure the entrance of both in next
year's tournament, for a third winning
entails absolute property rights ln the
cup. Neither Whitney nor the Hardys
have reached their limit in tennis. They
aro young men with sufficient Interest in
the game to continue their practice.
With these conditions Interest in tennis
should pick up during the coming year.

Last Sunday's rowing regatta was a suc
cessful one, the only mishap being the
links presents a series of brilliant pictures that would delight Charles Dana Gibson or any artist
in quest of the typical high-bred and unaffected American girl. To the uninitiated, who do not
know a "cleek" from a "hazard" it is a continual pleasure to watch her play. The illustrations
are from photographs taken expressly for The Call after Miss Moffltt's return from the scene of
her triumph at Burlingame. "
foul that occurred between the Alameda
and University of California boats in the
senior barge race. All the crews when
at the starting point were distinctly in
structed to disregard the stakeboat near
est the shore. The inside boat was di
rected to turn stake 2, the center barge
to take stake 3, and the boat having
the outside station was to round the outer
stako. The members of the Alameda crew
assert that they did not understand the
instructions and that they believed stake
boat 3 to be the turning point. But, even
If this were so, they are to blame for
starting without understanding the start
er's instructions. On seeing that the Uni
versity crew had no other stake but the
third open to them the Alamedas might
have taken the outside stakeboat, which
would, in the absence of any special in
structions, be the natural turning point
for the boat having the outer station.
Referee J. It. Bockman gave the only pos
sible decision when he disqualified the
Alamedas and ordered the University and
scratch crews to row the race again. It
was open to the referee to say whether
tho race should be from the point where
the foul occurred or over the whole
course, and on the same day or any other
day. Referee Bockman ordered the race
rowed again over the same course after
a reasonable rest, but the crews were un
willing to row again on that day. So
Sunday, the Â»th inst., at 10:30 a. m., and
the Long Bridge course were set as the
time and place. The race will be called
at that hour to-morrow, and should only
one of the crews present itself it will raw
over the course and take the prize.
Though the majority of the oarsmen are
much pleased at the entrance of the Uni
versity of California Into the local rowing
world and believe that it will be pro
ductive of increased public Interest In the
sport, there are some who do not regard
the presence of University crews in the
regattas on the bay as an unmixed ad
vantage. As workingmen, Â»who have to
devote the whole day to earning a living,
they feel that young men who have abun
dant leisure and can command the serv
ices of a competent and skilled trainer
enter the contest under strongly favorable
circumstances, and that they will prove
dangerous competitors to oarsmen not so
fortunately placed.
S. J. Pembroke Is desirous that the Uni
versity crew should take part in the As
toria regatta, and will endeavor to secure
a barge for their use. There Is no time
to place an order and have one built, but
one of the clubs might be Induced to
loan a barge to the University crew on re
ceiving a satisfactory guarantee against
loss and injury to the boat and fittings.
One or two single scullers may also repre
sent the University of California at the
northern water carnival.
The new South End barge is read*", with
the exception of the oarlocks and foot
boards. All the South End oarsmen who
went to the Astoria regatta last year are
desirous to go again. J. Foley and R.
McArthur are out frequently for practice.
The South Ends may hold a club regatta
as soon as the finishing touches have been
put on the handball court. When the club
has a barge that will place It on an equal
footing in competition with other clubs
it will make a determined effort to re
fain some of the championships it held In
ormer years.
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boating Club the following new members
were elected: John Beatty, H. H. Sher

Of the seven pennant matches which
have been played during the present sea
ton, the Callfornias have taken part in
four and have won them aIL The Ala
medas have played in live and have won
two, lost two and drawn one; while the
Pacifies, who have also taken part in five
matches, have lost four and drawn one.
The percentage of the Callfornias is
therefore 100. that of the Alamedas is 50
and that of the Pacifies is one-tenth, or .L
Inasmuch as, counting ln to-day's game,
oidy eleven matches (in eight of which
the Californias are engaged) remain to
be played for the Brown pennant, it Is
clear that the Californias will take a
great deal of beating. Joseph Brown. Ed

SPORTSMEN ARE

JReports From the preserves and
From the Country Promise
Qood Shooting.
The rapid approach of the shooting sea
son Is evidenced by the activity about the
sporting goods stores. Guns are being
overhauled and a supply of ammunition
secured by many sportsmen. Members
of the Country Club. Olympic Gun Club
and other organizations controlling pre
serves will avail of the opportunities pre
sented them for sport so soon as the sea
son opens. Doves are reported plentiful
ln all parts of the country, being more
scattered than In recent years. Deer are
also expected to give good sport.
Phil Bekeart and a party of Olympic
Athletic Club men will leave on the 22d
inst. for a week's outing in Mendocino
County, some thirty-five miles from
Ukiah. While they were in that district
in May they arrived at the conclusion
that ' deer would be plentiful when the
season opened. In addition to Mr. Bekeart
the party will consist of Dr. E. N. Short.
William Short. Thomas Craig, George
McCord and William McCord.
If the sportsmen of the various counties
combine ror the organized preservation of
game, as has been done in Mendocino and
Santa Clara counties, the solution of that
vexed problem has been found. Accord
ing to men who have given the matter
careful consideration the State could not
attain the same results In the preservation
of game from market hunters and others,
even though hundreds of thousands of
dollars be expended. The members of the
local organization know the condition.,
which must be met and the best manner
of treating them.
Four arrests have already been made
near Ukiah of persons who have been
killing deer cut of season. In each in
stance the accused have either pleaded
guilty or have been convicted If their
cases went to trial. Through an inadver
tance credit was recently given Alfred V.
La Motte for instituting the movement in
Mendocino County. Mr. La Motte in the
following letter, places the credit where
lt belongs. He says:
In The Call of June SO, I see an article
entitled "Punishing the Deer Slayers "
which gives me the credit of instituting thÂ«
crusade now on. Although in full sym
pathy with the work. I cannot allow the
Injustice of assuming a credit not due me
The citizens of Ukiah employed the war
den, who has done the good work recorded
And to them collectively the credit ls due. '

"Never was there such fishing in the
world." is the way Fish Commissioner
Baboock enthuses over the sport now be
ing enjoyed by the rod-wielders at Tal
lac. The hotels are thronged with guests
who find sport in the fishing. One woman
and a boatman caught seventy-two trout
in one day while the average runs nearly
forty to the boat per day. Dr. Harry
Tevis, W. S. Tevis and John Siebe have
spent some time at Tallac recently.
Fish Commissioners Babcock and W. H.
Keller inspected the Tahoe and Tallac
Hatcheries last week. After completing
the round of inspection Mr. Keller re
turned to his home in Santa Monica. The
trip from Truckee to Tahoe will be an
easy one next year, as work on the rail
road connecting these points is being
pressed vigorously. The hauling of rails,
ties and other material has left the stage
road in bad condition.
W. D. Mansfield, whose flycasting has
been a revelation to the world, does not
anticipate much more pleasure on the
mountain streams and lakes this season.
Business may necessitate a trip East,
which would take up his time until near
the end of the season. Should he go East
he may return by way of Pelican Bay,
where "the fishing is excellent from June
until October. Mr. Mansfield and Alex
T. Vogelsang went to Verdi, Nev., during
the Independence day holidays. They
fished on Saturday and Sunday, when Mr.
Mansfield was taken ill and was forced to
return home. Mr. Vogelsang enjoyed good
fishing, returning home Wednesday.

SAN BARBAE/- DOQ S)HOW
The second annual show held by th*.
Santa Barbara Kennel Club is announced
and this young club may well be excused
by Its enthusiasm for the mistakes caused
by inexperience. There are a few medals
offered as specials, notably by enthusi
asts, such as Norman T. Stewart and
others, and four silver cups, but the bulk
of the specials consists of merchandise.
The entrance fee is $3 for the first entry,
each class after that being half of that
amount. The fox terriers will be Judged
by C. A. Sumner of Los Angeles, a gen
tleman of exceptional knowledge of the
breed and of the strictest impartiality.
Dr. E. A. Dial of San Luis Obispo will
judge foxhounds and bloodhounds, and
Francis T. Underhill of New York will
perform a similar service for - mastiffs.
The balance of breeds will be judged by
H. T. Payne. He ls undoubtedly an ex
pert on setters, but his knowledge of
other breeds has been questioned in the
past.
The show will be held under the rules
of the Pacific Kennel League, and the
awards will consequently obtain no recog
nition outside of the Pacific Coast, and
inside that limit will be recognized only
by the clubs which are members of that
organization.
B. Brvon of Alameda has arranged to
breed his Great Dane bitch. Queen Olga.

MORE MONEY DEPOSITED WITH THE CALL
TO BRING THE BIG FIGHT TO THIS CITY

Buckley at Livermore and
Wants to Meet His Op
ponent Here.
â¦
It being hardly in the nature of things
that a successful rival to Jeffries or
Sharkey will develop before the end of
next -.ear. it is probable that these two
shining lights of pugilism will fight the
last great battle of the waning century.
Jt is more than likely that it will be con
tested In this city. Two offers have been
made of (40,000 each to that end, and The
Call has now in its possession certified
checks as an evidence of their good faith.
It remains with the heavy-weights and
their backers to accept or reject San
Francisco as a battle ground.
Following close upon the heels of
Charles Newman and his check for $5000
the Glen. Park Company, by its manager,
Reproduction of the Big Certified ChecK in the Hands of Th)e Call.
H. I. McGill. deposited yesterday with this I
paper a tilled check for $10,000 on the
Crocker-Woolworth National Bank to
bind its offer of a $40,003 purse to bring j
the battle to the Mission resort.
The conditions attached, in addition to !
the provision for a thirty-round contest in i
September, as first specified, arc to the !
effect "that the deposit will remain subject i
to action by Jeffries or Sharkey until the ]
17th inst.
"Our object in limiting the time," said j
Manager McGill. "is to prevent, in as far I
as possible, the peddling of the fight. In |
other words, we do not care to keep our
money on deposit at the call of the back
ers of the fighters so they can use it as a |
lever to tilt the purse on the Eastern end. .
If they mean business our money is ready. 1
O'Rourke and Brady can be reached by
wire in no timo. and the whole matter can
be settled once for all within the ten days, j
If we get the fight, we'll make it a |
popular priced affair. Our park is j
splendidly situated and we can build
an amphitheater in a valley sheltered
by hills to seat 100,000 people,
every one cf whom can see the ring.
The general idea is to have some
seats as low as a dollar.
"With the crowds that will come from j
all parts of the country to see that battle
and our own sport-loving public we have
no fears of the ilnancial end."
Both Jeffries and Sharkey, who have
befn apprised of these offers, have ex
pressed a desire to fight in this city, ad
mitting, of course, the certainty that the |
fight will go with the heaviest nursÂ°. j
Manager. Brady being in London, address j
unknown, and Manager o"Kourke en rouie j
to Denver, could not be reached yester- j
day by wire. O'ltmirke's secretary, how- j
ever, was interviewed in New York fori
The Call.
"As the Coney Island Club has an-!
nounccd its intention to offer $50,000," he I
said, 'it is not likely that either principal
will accept either San Francisco offer of !
540.000. e.-peoially ns Coney island is so j
near New York that the gate money !
would be greater than the San Francisco \
receipts. Several other clubs hereabouts,
including the Broadway Athletic and the
Winchester, will outbid San Francisco."
The Caii correspondent adds that he was
at Jim Corbett's saloon during the after
noon and canvassed ' the general opinion,
which he found leaned to the belief that
San Francisco would have to raise the bid
to get the fight. Bn|
Sam Thall. Brady's manager, now in
this city, was of the same opinion.
"I do not see," he said, "how these bids
of Newman and the Glen Park people can
be considered, although there may be a
way. Under the articles of agreement the
tight is set for October 23, and all our ar
rangements are made with that end in ,
view. How, without completely shatter
ing our present arrangements, we could
bring off the fight In San Francisco in
September I can't see. Then again, it
was stipulated, after Brady and O'Rourke
signed articles, that all bids must be
sealed and submitted, accompanied by a
certified check of $2600. to Matt Clunie at
the Vanderbilt Hotel, Forty-second street
and Lexington avenue. New York, not to

Champion Jeffries was over at Oakland
last night and to his friends he confided
his wish that the fight could be brought ,
off in San Francisco. His visit had been
loudly heralded and â¢ several hundred
members were on hand to welcome the i
champion. There was no formality to the
affair, but for a quarter of an hour Jeff
ries was shaking hands and receiving the |
congratulations of his friends. Jeffries
has ways been very much attached to
the Reliance and trained there for one of I
his early fights. Next Friday evening
Jeffries promised to be present at the Re- !
liance Club's boxing night. Three ten- ,
round contests have been arranged for the
occasion.
The chamnion and his party leave the
Third and Townsend street depot at 10:30
o'clock this morning for San Jose, where

Jeff a Winner From
Way Back.
â â¢ â
WAS BOUND TO LICK FITZ
A BROOKLYN MAN PROVES IT
BY HIS PEDIGREE.
â¦
One of the Champion's Norman An
cestors Probably Whipped a
Cornish Ancestor of
Lanky Bob.
â¢
More than eight centuries ago an an
cestor.of Jim Jeffries probably put out a
forefather of Fitzsimmons. The docu
ment to prove it is in the possession of
Billy Delaney, who trained the young
Californian for his battle with the lanky
Cornishman. He received it yesterday
from the Rev. Alexis Â«'. Jeffrie, father
of the champion, to whom it was sent ir,
the form of a letter, by a namesake, J. C.
Jeffries, of 652 Fulton street, Brooklyn.
N. Y.
According to the Brooklyn Jeffries i
James J. is a pugilist with a nedipr. c as
long as a pipe dream and a genealogical
tree as high as the price of a box at the j
Coney Island Club. By reason of these
I priceless possessions he is entitled to
1 stamp a crest on his note paper with the
; motto. "Post nubilla Phoebus;," which,
: freely translated, means, "After clouds
comes sunshine."
This is not moonshine. The Brooklyn
j Jeffries, who is evidently a pod-fearing
man with an eye on the motto on the
j reverse of the round American dollar,
â knows apparently whereof he speaks and
I had gone to considerable trouble in dust
i Ing the family archives before he posted
j the Important document, which was writ
! ten two days after Jeff had knocked Fitz
j into the "middleweight" class.
'.'As our family knew it." lie began, "the
original slock of the Jeffries was Scandi
navian or North Viking. They started in

Normandy about the year 900 and went to
England in 10.6." â¢ ../'v. ''â¢""*"."..-
When the Brooklyn Jeffries wrote that
paragraph he undoubtedly had in his
mind's eye the landing of William the
Conqueror and the apparition of a mighty
Jeffries on the Sussex coast of England,
where the last of the Saxon Kings, cer
tainly supported by the nearby Cornish,
was making a stand. What more proba
ble than that a rude and untutored Jef
fries swatted a shivering ancestor of the
most wonderful freak* that ever invaded
the prize 'ring.
"In early periods." the Brooklyn chron
icler writes, "their name was known as
Godfridus, Godefroy, Godefry, Godfrey,
which in latter times was gradually
changed to Gecfferoi, Jefferry, Jefferey.
Jeffrey. Jefferies, Jeffries."
He might have added: "The man that fit
Simmons." but he refrained. He contents
himself by throwing In the information
that Chief' Justice Jeffreys. Baron of Wem.
the butcher of the "bloody assizes" that
followed the collapse of the Monmouth re
bellion, was a scion of the same family.
The first Jeffries In America landed in
1681. settling at Uplands, now Chester, Pa.,
and dying after the manner of his kind,
leaving a large family, to inherit his name.
Like most heirs, they scattered their for
tune during the centuries, until the name
of Jeffries was represented In all the thir
teen original colonies. The record of the
Brooklyn Jeffries shows that some of his
collateral ancestors sent forth many
shoots from the genealogical tree. One
of them. Richard Jeffries, born at East
Bradford, Pa., in 1730, was the father ot
twenty-nine children.
After imparting all this information, the
Brooklyn Jeffries, who .met Jim last sum
mer and took quite a fancy to him, closes
With some advice. He says:
Jim was quite a surprise to those Interested
ln his family, as they thought the other fel
low Invincible. The general public can't un
derstand it. But on second thought they real
ized that a real master hand had appeared.
Hi. -victory- was a revelation and a great light
SPORTS
has been thrown on pugilism, which clears
1 away prejudice and. elevates his calling to that
high standard which commands , respect and
admiration from all. â  -..-â Â»' 'â 'â 'â _' .'.** : ~ ; -
There has been so much bragging and so
much back talk among the would-be fighters
that the general public was more or less dis
gusted. While the receipts. $89,000. for admis
j sion to the fight were lan** 1 *" than any previous
contest, the betting by the sporting element
was far less. This was due to the fact that
they did not think Jim from his experience
could possibly win. I for one doubted his vic
tory. " Â,1
The motto of the family, which is still ased
in En_lar.d and America, is -Post Nubllla
Phoebus." I knew the family stock back to the
tenth century and that the fighters of the fam
ily who selected that motto knew the sun
would shine after the clouds had passed.
You said the Lord was with Jim and his con
test, and I believe that the Lord Is faith, an.
faith is honesty of purpose. Jim was faithful,
honest and manly. His whole conduct before
and since the fight and all his utterances have
shown that innate manhood which makes this
.life perfect. He has shown himself so rar
above the element which usually follows nis
chosen profession that the sporting public ana
general public seemed dazed. On all sides there
seems to be an aw-, a feeling of respect which
makes men pause. It rests with Jim to Keep
his profession up to that high standard to
which he has elevated it. and I feel sure that
he will do all in his power to do so.
There are breakers, however, but after the
clouds have passed the sun will shine ana
good American eagles, too. . '_â â â,
Honors and eagles go hand in hand, and now
that Jim has all the honors of the champion
ship he should look carefully to the financial
end. as eagles are good things to have after the
honors have passed. Fitzsimmons felt that the
honors might get away. Therefore he de
manded the lion's share of the money. It was
a simple business transaction. He had the
honors of the championship and Jim wanted it.
Fits named his price and got it. and now- he
must be not. only a fighter but a financier as
well
It is believed here that Jim as a fighter is
an unknown quantity. He knows his reserve
for.-c and I hope he will take care of it and
hold the honors he now has for years to come,
and In the meantime look as carefully to the
harvesting of dollars as the honors. Dollars
: will bring more happiness to him and his dear
ones in later life.
SHARKEY AT LIVERMORE.
The Sailor Is a Guest of Boss Chris
Buckley.
LIVERMORE. July 7.â A Call" corre
spondent interviewed Thomas J. Sharkey
to-night at Christopher A. Buckley's
pretty country home, Ravenswood, a few
miles' south of this place. The pugilist
has been the guest of the blind politician
for several days and will remain here
until the first of next week. Sharkey hav
ing lined well was in an affable mood
and was willing to answer all the ques
tions" asked.
"What do you think of the $40,000 offered
by San Francisco people for your fight
with Jeffries?" he was asked. , ; Â« "
"I would like to light in San Francisco."
he replied, "but. of course, it's a matter
of the best offer. A New York manager
has already offered $50,000" if we pull off
the fight in New York, and I believe the
Lenox Club will bid $10,000 more. As that
would make $20,000 more than the San
Francisco offer, it would be a big in
ducement for us to go East. I would
rather fight in California than anywhere
else, however, because both Jeffries and
myself are Callfornlans and it would seem
the best place to hold the match. I hope
the matter can be arranged."
"You positively would not entertain the
offer of $40,000 as detailed in The Call of
this morning?", again asked the corre
spondent.
"No," replied the sailor. -.;/;;
â  "It has been hinted rather broadly by
a number of sporting men. Mr. Sharkey,
that you will refuse to sign articles with
Jeffries. What have you to say ln regard
to these rumors?"
"Will I fight him?" said the pugilist
scornfully. "Just wait until the time
comes and I will be ready to .fight.
"There is another thing you can say
for me," he continued. "I have never said
anything against Jeffries as the papers
say i have. 1 was glad to see a Call
fornian like Jeffries whip Fitzsimmons.
it will be all the more credit for me when
I whip him." â¢ -'â 'â :'.'â .'.:._â - â ..'".".
"It will be a- battle royal .when these
men come together," interjected Buckley,
who was present at the Interview. "'Two
powerful young men. thoroughly skilled
and who have practically never been de
feated ought to make the greatest battle
â  ever fought." ___
Sharkey is thoroughly enjoying his out
ing in the Livermore hills and declares
; that he never felt better. He professes
himself anxious, however, to prepare for
the big fight which he declares will settle
the question of the championship for a
long time to come.
DEFEATED BECAUSE HE
WAS NOT ACCLIMATED
DENVER, July "Kid" Parker of
Denver defeated "Jack" Carrig of Buffalo
In the sixth round of 'what was to have
been a. twenty-round go before the Colo
| rado Athletic Association to-night. "Kid"
McCoy acted as referee. When the gong
sounded at the close of the sixth round
Carrig was on the mat, where he had
fallen in sheer exhaustion a second be
fore. He was carried to his corner by, his
I seconds, who Inter announced that Car
' rig conceded the fight to Parker. , " : :
The bout was hard fought during the
! first three rounds, honors being about
i even. It soon became evident that
: "Jack's" wind was seriously impaired. In
I the last three rounds he was on the mat
a number of times, and only arose ln time
j to. prevent being counted out. His grit
won him much applause.- Another thing
; that was noticeable in Carrig was the
; lack of steam In his blows. He landed
frequently " and in vital places, but his
blows, as a rule, had not the least effect
j on Parker, who was strong and active
'. and was the aggressor throughout. Stim
| ulants had to be given frequently to Car
| rig to brace him up, and after the ftjiht
| he complained very much of trouble in his
j breathing apparatus. .
It was plain. to all that Carrig had not
sufficiently acclimated . himself to follow
such a pace as Parker cut out for him.
but he lacked nothing in gameness, and
it was only at; the. urgent advice of his
seconds that he consented to throw up the
sponge. Four thousand persona witnessed
the fight. ,-- - "â.._'-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 7.â ln a fast, fierce
battle that went the limit of twenty-five
rounds, "Jack" O'Brien of New York was
the victor over "Dal" Hawkins of San
Francisco at the Broadway Athletic- Club
to-night. The winner came to the ring
side as the shortender in a 2 to 1 betting
proposition and won almost as he pleased.
He was not at any time in very serious
danger and had everything his own way
after the fifteenth round. Hawkins in
jured his left hand in the early part bf the
fight hut even if he had had the free us*
Of it throughout the cent* st it is improb
il>le that he could have won or even gut
â¢ a draw.
The fight, although fast and game, was
not satisfactory. It was first announced
that the men would fight straight Queens
berry rules. Then, in the second round,
they agreed to break clean and failed to
do so. There was no announcement of
the latter agreement until later, and as a
result th.re was an immense amount of
wrangling and confusion. The crowd
hissed both men for fouling, but Referee
"Johnny" White contented himself wit!*,
rather mild cautioning. The men did
about as they pleased. They hit in
clinches, hit with the free arm and hit at
the breakaway.
In the eighteenth round White took mat
ters into his own hands and at every
clinch forcibly broke the men. Even at
that they tried to hit each other both in
the clinches and after the breakaway.
Hawkins was the veteran of the two
and seemed more shifty on his feet, but
O'Brien kept boring in on him and seemed
to manage to get inside of his punches.
They both weighed 133 pounds, but
O'Brien was the stronger. More than 3000
persons saw the contest.

ONWENTSIA GOLF COURSE, LAKE
FOREST, 111.. July The golf champion
ship of 1889 will be won by an Eastern
man. H. M. Harriman of the Meadow
brooke Golf Club, Hempstead, L. 1., and
the present champion, Findlay S. Doug
lass, won the semi-finals in the amateur
golf tournament at Onwentsia to-day. and
to-morrow will meet in the deciding strug
gle for the championship. It will be a
Scotch golfer against a native American.
Harriman, who formerly played football
and baseball at Princeton, won so im
pressively to-day from his opponent.
Charles B. Mac Donald, and displayed
such good form in every phase of the
game that to-night many of the golfers (
who have followed the play of the two
men throughout the week are of the opin
ion that Douglass will be pressed harder
in to-morrow's game than at any time
during the present week, and will have
to be at his best to retain the champion
ship. The general belief is that the game
will not be won by more than two or
three holes by either man.
Mai Donald's defeat by Harriman re
moved the last Westerner from the list
of contestants. This game, because on it
depended whether or not a Wlesterner i
would contest in the finals, prove* a lode
stone to the enthusiasts who came out
to view the final struggles, and an un
usually large gallery closely followed the
play during both the morning and the |
afternoon. Mac Donald's work was a de
cided disappointment to his friends. He
did well during the first nine holes of the
morning, but coming in he fell down badly '.
on his iron work, losing several holes by j
poor putting that he should have won, or |
at least halved. Harriman played con- :
sistent golf throughout. His drives all
day were longer than Mac Donald's,
though perhaps not enough so to mate- :
rially affect the result. It was on his
putting and short iron work that he ex
celled, and this finally won him the game.
Champion Douglass had an unexpect
edly hard struggle to win from C. H.
Travis. These two met last year in the
semi-finals. Douglass secured a decisive
victory. To-day, however. although ;
Douglass finished the first eighteen holes
four-up, the game was not decided until
the thirty-fifth hole had been negotiated.
Travis played a beautiful game against
the heavy odds, and although the cham
pion was dormie five at the thirty-second
tee Travis by some of the prettiest ap
proach shots and puts seen during the
tournament won the next, three holes.
Douglass halved the thirty-fifth, however,
and the match was over. Douglass, ap
parently confident in his ability to win
out, played carelessly coming in. and to
this fact was partly due the closeness of
i the score.
Findlay S. Douglass, D. R. Forgan and
W. J. Travis, who tied at 17.': for the
bronze medal in the qualifying round
on Monday, will play off their tie to-mor
row afternoon after the championship
game is over. Nine holes will be played,
the lowest medal score winning.

HENLEY-ON-THAMES, July 7.â The
Henley royal regatta came to an end un
der the most favorable conditions. The
weather to-day was perfect, but the at
tendance was not so large as usual. The
racing contained no surprises and no close
finishes. There was a feeling of relief,
however, when in the stewards' cup Mag
dalen disposed so easily of the German
crew, that many had predicted would win.
The cheers that greeted the winners were
much heartier than those given to any
other victors and emphasized the general
joy that the trophy was not to be taken
abroad.
There was also much enthusiasm when
the young Etonians -fairly rowed down
their' strong opponents, Pembroke College,
in the ladies' challenge plate and re-es
tablished their claim as the holders of
this trophy. -'â¢ , ,
Howell's victory in the diamond chal
lenge sculls was also immensely popular.
When Lady Esther Smith presented the
prizes after the races Colonel Willan, the
umpire, made a brief speech, in which he
welcomed the foreign crews to Henley.
He said:
"We are especially glad to renew ac
quaintance with the Argonauts, who
made such a favorable impression when
they were here two years ago. Although
we should be extremely sorry to part with
the cup. there is no place we would rather
see it go to than Canada.".
When Gold came up to receive the prizes
for the grand and for the stewards' he
was greatly cheered, in recognition of the
skill in which he had piloted the two
crews to victory. Gold stroked the Lean
ders when they defeated Yale.
Howell, the American oarsman, of Trin
ity Hall, Cambridge, beat Blackstaffe of
the Vesta Rowing Club in the final heat
for the diamond sculls, of which Howell
is the holder. Blackstaffe tried to slip
off. but Howell responded splendidly, and,
cutting his opponent down, went right
ahead. Blackstaffe hung on to Fawrey
Court, where he stopped, dead beat. How
; ell puddled in four lengths ahead in 8 min
utes 6 seconds. . ; "
In the final heat for the Wyfold chal
lenge cup (fours! Trinity Hall beat the
London Bowing Club. Trinity Hall was
off first, rowing 38 strokes to the London
crew's 39. The latter caught Trinity Hall
at the top of the island and a terrific
' struggle ensued. Trinity Hall, however,
, â gradually forged ahead", at the mile they
were clear of the opposing oarsmen, and
they won by two and three-quart*
lengths. Time, 7:57.
In the final heat for the Ladies* chal
-1 lenge plate (eights) Eaton beat Pern
, broke. Eaton struck a 39 stroke to Pem
broke's 40, but promptly went to the front
and was a half-length ahead at the Rec
tory. At Fawley Court Eton was a lengtn
: ln front and Pembroke drew up, but Eton
spurted and won by two lengths and a
quarter in 7:20.
In the final heat for the Grand challenge
. cup the Leander Club beat the London
Rowing Club. The Leander crew, wits a
stroke of 41 to the London crew's 40. were
: speedily in front and gradually forged
, ahead, winning by a length and a quarter
in 7:12.
In the final heat for the Visitors' Chal
lenge cup (fours) Balliol College, Oxford,
beat New College. Oxford. Balliol and
New College both started off with thirtv
seven strokes, but Balliol promptly went
ahead. When half the distance had been
covered the New College lessened the lead
of their opponent, but their boat com
menced to roll and Balliol won by a
length. Time. 8:01.
In the final heat for the Thames Chal
lenge cup. First Trinity beat the Kingston
Rowing Club. First Trinity was the
quickest in getting away, was a length
ahead at Fawley Court and won by two
and three-quarter lengths. Time. 7:25.
In the final for the Silver Goblets and
Nlcholls cup (pairs), the Leander Club
beat the St. George's Hospital Club. The
contest was very one-sided. Leander be
ing a length ahead a quarter of a mile
from the start. The I.eanders continued
in the lead easily and won by a length
and a quarter In 8:48.
In the final heat for the Stewards' Chal
lenge cup (fours), Magdalen College, Ox
ford, beat the favorite Hammonia crew of
Hamburg. This was a runaway affair.
Although the Germans got away first and
led to the top of the island, bad steering
lost them a lot of ground and the Mag
dalen crew, rowing splendidly, won by
five lengths. Time. 7:51.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July -Sentiment on the Stock
Exchange favored lower prices during the
greater part of to-day's session, but the feeling
changed in the late dealings and prices were
brought well above yesterday's level before the
close. The late strength originated ln the south
western group of railroads. Missouri Pacific.
Kansas find Texas preferred, Wabash preferred,
Texas and Pacific and St. Louis Southwestern
preferred all rose between one and two points
and arouse,', an active buying movement ln
ether portions of the list. It was notable, how
ever, that some of the stocks which have en-
Joyed the largest share of attention recently fell
into comparative neglect when interest began
to be manifested in the southwesterns. The
grangers, however, after morning declines aver
aging a point, were bid up well above last
right's close ln late dealings. Good weather in
the Northwest and weakness in the wheat mar
ket and Rradst*-, et's decrease of 3,500.000 bushels
in European wheat stocks were the motives for
the buying or" the grangers. Part of this buy
ins was said to be to cover shorts put out
yesterday. Atchison preferred led the late mar
ket in point of activity and strength, rising
2% points above the early low point. Manhattan
showed independent strength before the market
generally had turned upward. The stock rose
to within a shade of 122, but reacted about a
point. The upward movement in Pennsylvania
and New York Central at the opening on a
published report of a plan to consolidate, did :
not hold the general market, though these two
individual stocks maintained the advance in
prices pretty well. Practically the maximum
gain for them was established in London be
fore the opening here. Pennsylvania was held
at 138 only momentarily and rated not far from
137 all day. The early period of the market
was given over to continued liquidation. The
industrial laities and local traction stocks
were notably weak. The late strength of the
southwesterns were shaded by Chesapeake and
Ohio, Cleveland. Columbus, Cincinnati and St.
Louis, Tennessee Coal and Colorado Fuel. The
growing ease of the money market helped on the
late recovery in values. The fears of dearer
money in London gave away under the advance
of the Continental exchange on London. The
call rate dropped from 3c to 2c in London, ac- '
tual rates for sterling exchange fell % to % in
New York and call money was offered down I
to 4 per cent In New York.
Railroad bonds were only moderately active ;
and showed mixed changes. Total sales par
value. $3,3-5,000.
United States new 4s advanced % in the bid
price.

j The markets here were Idle to-day in view of
Monday's settlement. The tendency was good
I on the statement that the Transvaal authori
â  ties are climbinsr down and the contradiction
1 of the Bulgaria report. The close was irregu- \
I lar. Americans were erratic. London bought
I on a cable dispatch reporting that the New
York Central and the Pennsylvania railroad are
amalgamating, although the Morgans declared
It was bosh. New York sold freely, and wild ;
: stories were circuited first that Mr. Vanderbilt
was dead and then that young Vanderbilfs
motor car accident was serious. The close was
| rather above the worst. Erie, were excep
tionally hard.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
| NEW YORK, July 7. â Bradstreet's Financial
I Review to-morrow will say:
! The formal announcement of las; Friday we?k I
I that the lease of the Boston and Albany has ,
I been ratified by the New York Central direc- j
j tors, gave a further decided Impetus to specu- ;
lation on last Saturday. The market, accord
| ingly, closed decidedly strong for the three j
i days holiday, and totally disregarded both the [
| advance of call loan rates to 5*5- per cent |
! and the unexpectedly heavy reduction of bank j
â  reserve shown by the clearing house averages
| for the week. The speculative world is Inclined |
' to regard these two la.st mentioned circum- 1
; stances as well as the maintenance of rela- I
I tive-ly high call loan rates since the holiday, as
a temporary effect of the enormous July inter
est and dividend disbursements. The fact that
on Saturday the Vanderbilts, Grangers and
Standard railroad shares rose sharply and at
tracted nearly all the attention, showed the di- j
rection which the movement was inclined to !
take. It may also be specially mentioned that j
Pennsylvania shares were a feature, rising to :
137%, which shows the importance the street
attached to the alleged presence of its presi
dent, Mr. t'assett. at the ratification of the
Central- Albany lease. There have been ru- !
i mors that a compact had been made by which
I the Pennsylvania is to acquire control or* the j
! New York. New Haven and Hartford Railroad. I
That, however, is deemed impracticable and un
desirable, and the only valid deduction that
can be drawn from the circumstance in ques
tion is that unusual harmony prevails in the
trunk line situation.
lyondon prices for Americans advanced on j
Monday and Tuesday, when the New York and ;
other American markets were closed. When
the market reopened on Wednesday it had the '
bullish influence to support it as. well as the I
general expectation that a large part of the I .
extraordinary July disbursements, amounting '
from $120,000,000 to 8150,000,000, would find their j
wav into Wall street for investment. The manip- j
ulation was mainly directed to advancing prices
in various parts of the list. Pools and promi- I
nent houses were active in connection w,th j
their specialties, while the bond market pre- I
I sen ted a decidedly firm appearance. There, |
| however, appeared to be a disposition to take '
pofits In the Vanderbilt and Granger shares,
| which caused recessions from the early high
I prices for these securities and a number of
j specialties and low priced shares came to the
I front. The Industrials, top, once more became
I active and exhibited the influence of specula
! tive support and buying. These tendencies as-
J serted themselves more significantly ln Thurs
-1 day's trading, the tone of the market on that !
I day being strong in th" main, but were irreg- :
ular in different parts of the list and more of
a disposition to pay attention to the firmness
of call money and the failure of rates to relax
immediately. On Friday the tone was gener
i ally firm and was not affected by oiflcial de
nials of exaggerated reports about the vander
bilt-Pennsylvania alliance. The junior Van
derbilt stocks were strong features and ad
vances were also recorded in most of the Gould
properties. â 
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, July 7. â Bradstreet's to-morrow I
will say: Holiday observances and semi-annual
stock taking have worked toward quiet in gen
eral trade and industry, but it is significant of
the favorable conditions ruling in this as com
pared with previous years that trade advices
point to rather more than the average business
being done, notwithstanding the checks to de
mand shipments above 'mentioned. Additional
results of the season's work brought to light
are fully as favorable as those ln Bradstreet's
review last week, and furnish an adequate
basis for the general air of confidence with
which the business world faces the latter half
of the year. Bank clearing returns fully bear
out estimates given last week, pointing to un
precedented totals and enormous gains for the
six months' period over preceding years, while
Bradstreet's report as to prices points to a |
steady strengthening of quotations of staples I
and exceptionally tew decreases in prices reg- i
istered ln June. All indications favor a total
export trade little below that of last year's
.phenomenal total, what little falling off there
has been Shown being due to reduced European
takings of American food products.
Preliminary reports as to railroad gross earn- ,
ings indicate exceptionally good showings for
the month and the half-yearly period, the
gains, ln fact, being the heaviest reported this
year.
Distributive business, on seasonable account
is naturally on a small scale, but orders for fall
delivery are reported particularly liberal and
making favorable comparisons with last year.
In the Iron trade the strength of prices and
demand is still the most notable feature, fur
ther advances in pigiron being notable this | (
week and delays growing out of inadequate
supplies are becoming increasingly numerous.
Another strong situation Is found in the
woolen trade. Prices of better grades have been
advanced this week, on active demand from, i
dealers and manufacturers in sympathy with ,
the advance at London. The manufactured
product is strong and the new season opens ,
well. ,
Cotton has strengthened quite considerably,
owing to very heavy rains culminating ln dis
astrous floods In Texas.
ThÂ» wheat market has moved within a. narrow
range this week, weather conditions furnish
[ Ing the basis for most of the changes shown,
the closing of the week witnessing considerable
firmness on short covering, due to less satis
factory crop reports from the Northwest,
which are.- however, not confirmed by continued
heavy receipts at primary markets, by the
rather better than expected out-turn of winter
wheat and by the confident reports as to trade
received from the Northwest.
Among the industries which report a more
cheerful outlook than for some time past Is
that of anthracite coal, which was advanced
25c a ton July 1.
Rather more strength is noted ln lumber, and
the same is true of leather, partlculrly calf
skins, for which it Is understood the Govern
ment is In the market for considerable quan
tities. Stigar has sympathized with tendencies
of foreign markets, in which, speculative activ
ity has figured conspicuously. The extension
of the guarantee period on refined grades gives
color to earlier reports that competition will
not be especially bitter during the coming sea
son.
Wheat, Including flour, " shipments for the
week aggregate 3.758,972 bushels, against 3,268,
--998 last. week,. 2.728,642 In the corresponding
week of 1898. 2.502.606 bushels ln 1897, 2,167,076
in 1896 and 2.317.-37 In 1896.
Business failures for the week number 136 as
against 158 last week. 241 In this week a year
ago, 213 In 1897. 219 in 1896 and 266 in 1895. "
Business failures in Canada number 25 as
compared with 23 last week. 16 In this week a
year ago. 34 in 1837. 39 in 1896 and 30 in 1805.
DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW.
" NEW YORK. July 7.â R. G. Dun' & Co.'s .
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow: !
Failures for the flr*t half of 1899, with bank- j
ing and financial Included, as In all accounts
I published, were 4484, with liabilities, $43,664,601. j
THE .SA_Sf FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY, JULY 8, 1899.
! Commercial failures were 4853, with liabilities
of 842,062.933, of which 816,728,353 were manu- :
facturing, 823,011,364 were trading. On the sec
ond quarter failures were the smallest ever
reported in that quarter for the twenty-five |
years for which quarterly reports have been
made by this agency. The average per fail
ure. $7165, is the smallest ever known in any '
. quarter: th" average per firm in business.
j $12 20. and the ratio of defaulter liabilities to '
| solvent exchanges, sixty-two cents per $1000, I
are the smallest ever known in any quarter, j
In ten Of the fourteen branches of manufac- â 
j turing failures were smaller than in the same j
' quarter of four of the previous five years.
i The larger failures for $100,000 or more, were :
1 i nly two in trading, for $224,088, less than a
: tenth of the smallest previous .ve-*,r, and only I
fifteen in all, for $2,417,180. from a fifth to a i
[ tenth of previous years. The decrease on the
: small failures is worth special study. |
Wheat declined three-eighths of a cent, ex- |
ports being but 2,250.021 bushels for the week,
, flour included, against 2,643,130 last year for
i both coasts, although Western receipts were '
3,861.523 bushels aeainst 618.492 last year. If \
the farmers actually carried over 68.000,000
bushels or mere a year ago, after $1 25(Â§2 per \
I bushel had been paid at Chicago for some i
: months, as one '.arming journal estimates, I
I they need the education â¢ which they are get- |
| ting, but the claim still entirely falls to ac
count for their liberal selling this year at
I lower prices. Contradictory guesses and hopes
continue, but this year is very hard on pre
dictions.
Scarcity and high prices of Iron and its ;
products can no longer be reckoned evidence
of good times. In the Shenago Valley six fur- ;
. naces have been stopped by a strike for 20
â  per cent more wages, and minor strikes are â .
I reported at various iron works, the tin plate'
I strike being yet unsettled. New orders re- j
ported continue larger, being evidently report
ed week after week at different cities because |
not taken, but the new orders accumulated do i
not equal the output of the works. Predic
tions of great scarcity of pigiron have lifted j
the prices still further to 91.2 per cent of the i
; average in January, 1887, but several more i
j furnaces ate going into operation and the I
i Illinois Steel Co. has contracted for. others I
of the largest capacity.
Failures for the week have been' 119 in the |
; I'nited States against 229 last year and 20 in |
: Canada against. 17 last year.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO. July 7.â September wheat opened
%c below yesterday's closing price, influenced j
-,' the start largely by improved weather con- !
ditions. Foreign markets were weak and lower
and domestic receipts were too heavy for de- |
mand. The total primary market receipts were j
838,000 bushels, against 5 87,080 the year be
fore, and London cabled that the supply there i
was in excess of demand. Argentine ship- j
ments for the week were 1,216,000 bushels, I
against 1,008,000 the week privious, while local j
receipts were 71 cars, against '-â ', a year ago,
and Northwestern receipts footed up 424, com
pared with 43 last year. All this was meat fOr
the bears and September went as low as 73VÂ»c.
Bradstreet's report of 1,700,000 bushels decrease,
in the world's visible and Duluth's estimate of .
April increase in. stocks there for the week of j
750.000 helped the market a trifle, but the pres- i
sure of immediate supplies was -more effective
upon speculative sentiment than a prospective j
scarcity, and September wound up with 73% c â 
bid. against 74' 4 c yesterday. .
Corn was dull and easy. September closed,
with a loss of %c. It followed wheat In the j
main.
Oats opened unchanged, but soon declined In '
(sympathy with wheat and corn. There was a j
good demand from shippers and the market |
rallied, closing at the highest, with a gain I
of Sac.
Provisions were steady after opening a shade .
lower than yesterday's close. Hog receipts '
continued heavy, but the excellent demand for
spot goods prevented short selling and main
tained prices. Pork and ribs closed unchanged.

Harrison's circular says: During the week
there have been the following arrivals of coal,
viz.: Three from Washington. 7565 tons; one
from British Columbia, 2350 tons; one from Ore
gon, 500 tons: total. 10,415 tons. The deliveries
this week are exceptionally light, aggregating
less than three days" actual consumption. An
other week's arrivals similar to this would
cause a material shrinkage of stocks in yard, j
as they would be generously drawn from. Al- j
most all the transportation of our northern coal
for the past month and for some few months to
come will be done by steamers, as about all our ,
locally owned sailing vessels have been ordered
off coast with lumber, etc. Prices are steady, j
being a lltie firmer if anything. The market is |
absolutely In the hands of the northern collier- ]
ies, as the total amount of â¢ foreign coal which i
can possibly arrive here during this month
dees not exceed 10,000 tons, being less than Is I
burnt up here in three days. There seems no
limit to the fuel orders for Honolulu, as there
are large buyers now in the market for Aus
tralian and British Columbia products at full
figures. Local consumption there has materially
Increased, but the principal orders are for the
requirements of the transports. At this time
last year there were forty-eight vessels loading j
coal in Australia for San Franciscoâ now there
are only thirty, but there are four more vessels j
loading now in Swansea than in July. 1898." â

THE STOCK MARKET.
Mining stocks stood about the same yester
day. Trading was light all day.
The Executive Committee of the Comstock
Pumping Association met yesterday to consider
contracts to supply the Comstock mines with
cheap electric, power and to levy an assessment :
of 124 per cent on the mining companies. This j
assessment Is part of the pro rata for drain- !
age expenses. 62',i per cent of which has now j
been paid. Two propositions for supplying the i
mines with electrical power were received, one
from the Truckee River General Electric Com
pany and the. other from parties represented by
â¢ Leon M. Hall. It was resolved that Charles
Hlrschfeld. president of the pumping associa
tion, should appoint a committee to consider
these propositions as well â¢as the whole ,
question of cheap power. The committee ]
named by President Hirschfeld consists, besides I
himself, of C. H. Fish. H. Zadig, C. L. McCoy. '.
W. G. Morrow, G. McM. Ross and C. B. \
Deutsche. The committee will meet next Mon- |
day.
The telegram from the pump said: "No. 1 ele- !
vator has been working continuously. The l
water is 190 feet 5 Inches" below the 1750-foot
level, having risen 1 foot 3 Inches In the last
twenty-four hours. The rise of the water Is
undoubtedly due to the rush of dammed-up
water from the 1960-foot level."

SO many people are away from
town on their summer vacations
that rer.! estate brokers hive
practically been driven to a
*â¢â ' standstill. They find it almost
impossible to consummate a promising
looking ileal for the reason that either
ihe prospective buyer or the prospec
tive seller is almost certain to be out
of the city just when his presence in
town is particularly necessary to close
the deal. Hut this state of affairs is
by r.o means abnormal, being simply
the usual thing during July, so that
while the brokers may grumble oyer
deferred commissions they have no
serious cause for complaint.
That the rea! estate market is dull
admits of no question; but the condi
tions are such that there is sure to be
a revival of activity early in the fall
after the crops have been harvested
and local investors begin to return to
tho city from the country and sea
shore. A good understanding of the
existing conditions as compared with
the state of the market in the pa_t
may be obtained from the followtn...
which forms a part of the half-year, y
summary appearing in the Heal Estate
Circular for June. published by
Tin. mas Magee <S_ Sons:
The total number ef real estate sales made
In "the city and county of san Francisco in
the first half of 1533 was 1566. of tho value of
t7;_-9.t_!4. â¢ This was an Increase; of J 336 in
the number and of f_,57.,3_5 in the value of
tlie sales over those of the previous huif
yea r.
There were points of resemblance in the
condition of the real estate market in the
flrst quarters of 1898 and 1899. In both want
of early rain led to anticipations of a dry
year and therefore to stagnation In real
estate. But that stagnation was not nearly
so marked in the first quarter of this as
In that of last year, -tuyers In IS3S thought
that, because we did not have rain, they
could buy at their own prices. They acted
upon that theory, but finding during the
months of April. May, June and July that
their calculations were not realizedâ that
oi* tiers -would not sell at their prlces-j-they
began to buy in the fall.
This year sales went on while the dry
weather lasted, but they increased consld
erablv after the heavy rain of March and
kÂ»pt "up fairly well until June, when the
siimracr season, the period of dullness, set
in. and -will continue until the fall.
One striking feature of the market this
year, and for a long time previously, has
been that nobody whatever counts in the
least on the future. Central property that
Is paving well alone is? looked at. Nearly all
outskirt business properties are left un
touched. Even Market street, ward from
Seventh street on the one side and from
Jones street ... is unsalable, rents
being very low and many hulldinKs poor
there. This want of trust in the future
and determination to buy only what is cen
tral and renting well is the natural outcome
of th" reverse condition of affairs which
prevailed from I*S7 to 1S31; when wholesale
purchases of suburban property were made,
largely on credit, due to wild discounting
of the ruture. That - inflated period re

Rev. J. W. Webb, chairman of the Pro- !
hlbltion executive committee, addressed i
a large temperance meeting in Howard
M. E. Church last evening. The audience
constated of Prohibitionists from sur- .
rounding bay towns and was very en- :
thulastic. The services consisted of sing- â¢
Ing and short talks by those present. Dr.
Webb proved himself a graceful and in- I
tcrestln*. talker. He is one of the most .
prominent temperance advocates On the '
confidence .In the future of the city than
at present, and ere never were as strong
grounds for Justification of lt.
The same publication contains also
the following article on tin condition
of th>- money market, which will be
of more than ordinary interest:
Durinz the first half of 1533, 19S1 city real
estate mortgages were recordeJ ; their ag
gregate value was $6,200,004. The total num
ber of releases of such mortgages recorded
was 160&. of the total value of $6,937,690.
Instead of an increase of real estate debt,
therefore, there was during the past six
months a decrease of $537,530. The city sav
ings-banks lent a total of $1,430,075 on city
real estate during the half year, and re
leased $4,545.'>14. so that they released nearly
J' "."') more than they lent. I'rivate lend
ers, too, released $322,651 more than they
lent. l>urlng the half year the large sav
ings banks have carried large cash bal
ances, although they have been liberal
buyers of bonds and flrst-class securities.
They have been driven Into that field of in
vestment because of the impossibility of ob
taining enough good city real estate mort
gages to keep then- surplus tunds employed.
Never in tne history of City real estate have
good loans l>"en so scarce. The tendency
has been altogether to reduce real estate
debts rather than to increase them. Of the
real estate mortgages recorded during the
last six months, tully one-half were renew
als of old loans.
The time is past when the loanable fun-Is
of the community, whether in the keeping
of corporations or individuals, can be chiefly
employed in lending on real estatr. Should
a much more lively demand for real estate
occur soon, as now seems most likely, con
current with the immense amount of sur
plus money, mortgage indebtedness will
greatly increase; but as the increase of
v-oaltli tends to the emancipation from debt
of owners of land, the outlook is that other
investments must toe sought by _avlngs
banks and capitalists, and it is re be hoped
thai their attention will be turned to manu
factures, upon which the prosperity of the
city largely depends.
The rati of interest during the half year
have been 6 1 . to 7 per cent, the lenders pay
ing the mortgage tax. About three-fourths
of the money lent by the banks of the cltj
was at -'2 per cent. With a more active
real estate market there will doubt he
an increased demand for money, but lt is
not at all likely that even an improved mar
ket could absorb all of the money seeking
investment. Capitalists will hereafter, we
believe, have to depend largely on Invest
ments tn the best of stocks and bonds as an
outlet for their money. Such Investments
have the great advantage of being easily
salable, in case of need lor ready money.
One-third of the money lent during the past
half year on city real estate was that of
private persons.
Something like a half million dollars was
lent upon city land mortgages during the six
months by private capitalists at 6 per cent,
the loans being mainly taken from former
creditors who refused to renew at that re
duced rate. The savings banks without ex
ception demand <'â -. which rate leaves them
after payment of mortgages as assessed last
year, 4.fi94 per cent net A few loan* tn
large Bums on choice property were made by
the banks at fi'-i per cent.
The record of real estate transac
tions for the month of June shows
that property valued nt $1,062.8 has
chanced hands during that time,
whicn is $500,000 more than the- figures
for the month preceding.

A BULLY ON A CAR.
Edward Goodfellow Convicted of Dis-
turbing the Peace and Exhibit
ing a Deadly Weapon.
Edward Goodfellow, a bottler for a
water company, appeared before Judge
Mogan yesterday on charges of disturb
ing the peace and exhibiting a deadly
weapon. He was convicted and ordered
into custody without bail to appear for
sentence this morning. The evidence
showed that Goodfellow was riding on a
Haight-street car on the Fourth of July
and commenced to make himself obnox
ious to the other passengers, mostly
ladies. li.- was check,-, 1 by E. Cox. the
grlpman, but it made him worse and he
used the most disgusting language. Cox
stopped the car to put ... off and Good
fellow pulled a revolver "tit of his pocket
and threatened to use it.
The Judge gave Goodfellow a severe
"roasting" and characterized his conduct
as that of a coward and bully. It Is
probable lhat he will give Goodfellow the
full limit.
CORONER HILL REBUKED.
The Japanese Consul Proposes to
Make Things Warm for Him.
Japanese Consul Mutsu has addressed
a letter to Coroner Hill, inquiring why the
two Japanese sailors, who were drowned
while attempting to escape from the Nip
pon Maru, were discriminated against by
being cremated by order of the Coroner
before the jury had an opportunity of
viewing the bodies. The Consul quotes the
State law on the subject of Inquests for
the enlightenment of the Coroner and
pointedly asks "why wore not the jury
allowed to view the bodies before holding
the inquest, as has been the custom from
times Immemorial whereof the memory of
man runneth not to the contrary."

GOOD CLAIMS ARE
NOW RESERVED BY
THE GOVERNMENT
Peculiar Action of the Dominion
That Has Caused a New Sen=
sation at Dawson City.
BY SAM W. WALL.
Special Correspondence of The Call. . ' . j
DAWSON, Y. T., June .s.â At this time
there If no means of making anything like
a close/ estimate of the output of gold
from the Klondike for this year. I have
traveled up and down the creeks that are
making the big yields and the creeks from
which most was to be expected in the way
;of new developments. Expectations have
' been exceeded in many places and have
i failed of realization in many others. The
washup is only half completed and what
': the footing will be cannot be more than
| vaguely guessed at. The so-called new
. creeks are turning out famously as a gen
! eral rule and the hillsides and hilltops are
developing very rich diggings. It can only
be repeated at this writing that the out
put will exceed that of last year by from
I a half to the full amount.
The camr> has been almost stunned by
I the publication of a notice from Ottawa
| directing that the hillsides arid benches
iof Bonanza and El Dorado creeks be
withdrawn from the publicâ that is to say
that no new locations may be made on
! those creeks. The communication from
j Ottawa is brevity itself. It says that the
! ground Is to be withheld and no more
; offers no explanation or excuse. The 10
--. cal authorities Interpret the terse message
' to apply to relocations of ground already
: staked, but which may be allowed to lapse
and to cover also the so-called "pups." or
i small tributaries of these, the two rich
: est streams in the diggings. The common
guess for this extraordinary step Is that
the ground still unclaimed on these
j streams is to be reserved for some rich
i syndicate and the plain prospectors and !
i miners who have sought and found the
i gold, and especially those . who are still
I seeking it and have not found it. are dis
! gusted and angry. The action of the Ot
! tawa Government is wholly unexpected,
no hint of it having been whispered here
' previous to the public announcement. The
news has spread rapidly and the demoral
izing effect is everywhere apparent. if
Bonanza and El Dorado are to be closed
; to the prospector because of his diligence
i in the face of every hardship has revealed
j them to be very rich the same result may
I be expected to follow the same effort on
every other creek. So they argue. One
of the immediate effects is . to give to
: every claim already recorded on these
' creeks an enhanced value.
No boat has yet arrived bringing pas-
I sengers, or merchandise direct from the
outside, either from up or down the river.
â¢The water front is lined with boats that
have come here from their winter quar
ters, having been released by the Ice. But
Bennett, at the head of the lakes, on the
southeast and St. Michael at the mouth
of the river have not yet reported. The
situation in steamboat circles Is most pe
culiar. The river Is alive with all man- '
I per of big craft, for which there is no
! business and will be no business this year.
1 The aftermath of the unparalleled Klon- j
dike stampede will present no more cu
rious feature than this. A few of the
: great fleet of boats that started fo^ this |
place, dispatched by visionaries and i
boarded and conducted by visionaries, '
have for the first time arrived only in j
; the spring of the year 1899. The Robert '
Kerr, one of the broken-backed Moran i
boats, is the most important of these. \
But in addition to the great fleet that
struggled up the river to this, their desti- :
nation, last year there is nearly a hun- |
dred boats that have not arrived and
', many of these will not attempt to get I
I here. There are fifty-three boats reported '
I In the Kuyokuk River alone, and the peo- i
| ple who went with them will almost to a '
j man return .disappointed. There are
! steamboats enough in the river, and good j
ones, too, to do twenty times the busi
ness that there will be here to do now j
I or any future time within the ordinary :
' life of the craft. Either of the two big j
pioneer trading and transportation com- j
panics have ample facilities for the car
rying of all the people and freight that
may be moved on the river this year.
Both the old companies lost their laeds
as completely as did the "checharcos," or
outsiders. They trebled their fleet at j
great expense, and so will have no us. !
for the boats of outsiders that will be i
, slumped on the market by the dozens
: during this short season and which may
be bought very cheaply. Already the
Rideout, chartered last year by th. La
Due Company, is offered for sale. With
i no business fur them there the. boats can- j
not be taken back whence they came for |
' the value of them, and if they could there
|Is no business for them there. So that
very many thousands of dollars represent
ed in these investments can be accounted
as already lost. The fleet of monster nas
\ senger boats built by the Alaska Com-
I mercial Company that traveled up and
| down the river last year with a mere cor
poral's guard of passengers aboard must
j suffer the same or a worse experience |

I this year, for the agents of the many rival
lines are already fighting like wildcats ,
i for the business in sight. The big crowd
i that is really desirous of going out lias
little money and are waiting for the low
rates that they know are certain to be
offered very early in the scramble. The
freight boats will carry- people down the
river for a little "above nothing, leaving
, them to find their way home from St.
Michael as best they can. The real con
. tention will be among the up-river boats,
I for the traffic, especially that of passen
gers, will be nearly all that way. The
North American Transportation and Trad
ing Company will turn several of Its new
fleet up that way. The John C. Barr has
already gone to bring in John J. Healy,
general manager, and a company of Unit
ed States Senators, now at the lakes, on
their way in to view the country.
Besides the melancholy outlook for the
big fleet as a whole, many of the boats
are having special troubles of their own.
I For. Instance, the Clara, owned by Sar.
Francisco parties, is tied up temporarily
by litigation which Eugene Schmitz and.
I Mr. Roncovieri â the. former the present ;
and the latter the ex-president of the
I company have come here to straighten I
out. P. Haussler, also of San Francisco, !
who held a mortgage over the boat and j
Its accompanying barge, and brought the
trouble upon the . company for his own I
gain, and is now a fugitive from justice. I
with officers ranging the country under a |
bench warrant for his arrest on a charge
of perjury. Haussler held a mortgage for j
' a small sum on both boat and barge, with I
j a condition permitting, him to foreclose '
| if one of the securities was separated j
I from the other. He himself advocated
! leaving the barge at Fort Yukon last fall,
j so that the boat might be certain to reach
| Dawson. Immediately upon arriving here
he foreclosed and secured the boat, refus- |
I ing to allow her to return down the river,
as she might have done. . He recovered
j the amount of his mortgage and is now ,
; supposed to be at Fort- Yukon trying to
recover it again -by the sale of the barge.
: In the meantime he is charged with per- :
â  juring himself in a suit over another
i transaction. On the arrival of Schmitz
and Roncovieri a few days ago he im
j mediately fled the country, forfeiting his
I bonds, and a bench warrant was issued.
Although it will give them some trouble,
Schmitz andr Roncovieri fully expect to
recover their property.
There have arrived here from down the
river the steamers Victorian, Sovereign,
Monarch, J. J. Healy. Rideout. Mary
Graff. Robert Kerr, Seattle; J. C. Barr
I and Arnold. From their quarters up the
river the following have arrived: Tyrrell
: Lia-htning, Canadian. P. B. Low, Pingree,
! Columbian and Flora. An amusing but
rather disastrous experience may be re
lated of the old Boston and Alaska Com
pany's boat, the Governor Pingree.
â  which, with its companion In disaster
last year, the Philip B. Low. have been
! extensively advertised here under new
' names, to wit: the Bonanza King and El
! Dorado and collectively as the "Yukon
I Flyers." While waiting for lakes to open]
the new managers conceived the Idea of .
I earning some of the advertising ex- !
j penses by a Sunday excursion to Forty
Mile, a little run of fifty miles down the
; river. The people responded and the boat
- was crowded, to.- boat left in the morn
: ing and was to return in the evening. It
! did not get back until the evening of the
[ next day. having been unable to breast
i the ourrent. Aid had to be asked from
passing boats and the old trick of mak
-1 ing the passengers chop the wood for the
furnace resorted to. Provisions ran out
j and those who did not come back on some
other boat arrived in a half-starved condi
tion. The names of the boats had been
â  changed because of th.- reputation for in
capacity and bad management they ac
quired last year, and this incident has
i thrown such a cloud over their new name
that there is some thought of christening
them again.
This review of the transportation busi
ness does not reflect the situation in other
1 lines. As yet very little merchandise has
arrived, that brought by the early barges
from the upper river being enough to
leaven the lump. The town is being built
up in new directions and putting on a '
much more substantial air since the clear
ing of the water front. The old shacks on
the front are being replaced by wharves
and warehouses. The tendgrloin is now
relocated and grouped within three blocks
back of its old quarter.
United States Consul McCook, who
brought suit against the Klondike Nug
get, charging criminal libel for the publi
cation of a description of a drunken brawl
in which he wis the principal figure, suf
fered the added humiliation of a verdict
in favor of the newspaper. In summing
up the court leaned In McCook's favor
as to the law while directly stating that
statements in the paper had been shown
to be true. Upon this the jury declared
the paper not guilty. The civil suit will
probably be dropped. The general health
of the people of the district remains ex
cellent. . *

BLANKET SCHEME OF
CRIMMINS AND KELLY
A Device to Capture the Republican
Convention.
Board of Election Commissioners May Determine to
Cast Aside the Apportionment at Large and Pro
vide for Election of Delegates by
Assembly Districts.
THE Republican County Committee,
in the adoption of the blanket
ticket scheme, took orders from
Crimmins and Kelly. It appears
that the committeemen who were
so eager to obey the bosses gave no
time to the consideration of the law.
The plan of apportionment; adopted
may therefore be set aside as contrary
to the provisions of the primary elec
tion law. Lawyers who have given the
subject earnest attention and whose
counsel was sought when th.- measure
was pending before the Legislature en
tertained the opinion that the term "at
Jarge" used In the law means Assembly
district. Surely the example of a bal
lot contained in the law leaves out this
assumption. The form given as the ex
ample indicates that eight delegates are
to be voted for. The framers of the act
jio doubt had in mind eight delegates
from an Assembly district, which in
San Francisco would give a conven
tion of 124 delegates.
The plan of apportionment or the
-scheme of electing delegates at large
recommended by the County Committee
ought not to in adopted by the Election
â¢Commissioners, because it is cumber
some, absurd, vicious and expensive.
Days if not a week will be required to
count the ballots and enter on the tally
â sheets the vote for each delegate. Un
der the system which permits the vot
ers in every precinct to vote for all the
delegates to the convention each ballot
âºcast will contain the name of 306 dele
gates to the Republican convention in
â¢â¢addition to the names of delegates to
â¢the conventions respectively of other
political parties.
The Democratic vote under the As
sembly apportionment plan might be
tallied in seven or eight hours, as each
ballot will contain say seventeen names,
but when it comes to a tally of all the
names on the Republican ballot the
number of hours must be multiplied by
eighteenâ the number of the Assembly
districts. It may therefore require 124
hours to tally the Republican vote.
To make room for. 306 names in let
ters of the size designated by law the
ballot must be more than six feet long.
It is suggested that Phil Crimmins and
Martin Kelly desired in presenting
this style of ballot to bring the law
Into derision. The Election Commis
sioners may therefore deem it right and
proper to declare that no apportionment
within the scope of the law has been
designated, and proceed under author
CLASH BETWEEN
D. M. BURNS AND
THE GOVERNOR
Gage's Recent Airs of
Independence.
â â
WARM WORDS EXCHANGED
â Â»
TROUBLE GREW OUT OF STATE
PRISON PATRONAGE.
â¦
The Executive and the Mexican Could !
Not Agree on a Candidate for
Commissary at San
Quentin.
â¦
The air of independence assumed by
Governor Gage is producing agitation
in the political atmosphere. The gen
eral belief is that a clash between Burns
and Gage is impending. Inside Intelli
gence is to the effect that the Mexican
and the executive had a little "tiff"
about the selection of a commissary at
San Quentin. Gage is reported to have
displayed the courage, or exhibited the
effrontery, to suggest that he should
have a voice in the selection of the
prison attaches.
Burns had a candidate for commis
sary to succeed Thomas Mekinson, and
directed Warden Aguirre to appoint
that candidate. The Governor desired
that Thomas Foley, the father of \V. I.
Foley, his priyate secretary, should re
appointed. Burns and Gage had a
warm exchange of words over this pa
tronage. Th- Governor was inclined to
yield, when he ascertained that the
Board of Prison Directors would not
stand for the man of Burns' choice. The
directors indicated that a scandal would
follow if the Mexican's candidate ob
tained the position. Still Aguirre and
Burns insisted, and then the board
threatened to lower the salary to $25
a .nth if Burns' favorite were in
stalled. .
Gage, who had weakened at first,
braced up and told Burns that the ap
pointment (the Mexican's choice)
should not be made. This nearly caus
ed an open break, and so angered
Burns that he said harsh words, with
the result that Gage told Burns it
would be a fine thing to let him (Gage)
run at least one institution to suit him
self. Since then Burns has not had a
thing to say in prison .affairs and ap
peals to him for places have met with
the reply that he was keeping his
hands off San Quentin and Folsom.
The next row came over the appoint
ment of Leon Dennery. Burns was
promised by Gage, some time ago, thai
he should have the exclusive handling
of the Board of Health. Who:, .he
board objected to Dennery, \ Burns
whipped it into -line. So keen -was the
feeling in local political circles that
politicians of both parties (certain
Democrats taking a hand out of per
sonal friendship and common railroad
affiliations) went to Gage and told him
that the advocacy of such men as Den
. nery by Burns was bringing a stain
un the administration that would prove

ity of the primary act to apportion by
Assembly district. The County Com
mittee, perhaps inadvertently, left the
way clear for the performance of the
act by the Commissioners when it des
ignated seventeen delegates from each
district in order to provide for the
whole number of 306.
Should Crimmins and Kellv resent
this interference they can appeal to the
courts. It would then be seen whether
the courts would construe a statute to
lead to such an absurdity as that which
the County Committee suggests In pro
viding a blank ticket in which the elec
tor is asked to write in 306 names, or
provide a paster six feet in length. No
doubt the bosses surmise that only
rounders and regular political workers
will take the trouble to paste in all the
306 names.
The Republicans of san Francisco
hoped that the County Committee
would respect the sentiments of the
people. The public was weary of the
tight for spoils which had brought to
the front contending factions of the
Democratic party. The demagogic
tricks of Phelan. the smooth manipula
tion of McNab's Committee of One
Hundred, and the appearance of Ross
Buckley, backed by the railroad power,
caused the reputable citizens and tax
payers of the community to turn to the
Republican organization for good gov
ernment .under the new charter. The
County Committee had the opportunity
that comes not often to the leaders of
the political organization. The bosses
of the Kelly and Crimmins type, true
to the instincts of bossism, took the
first opening to betray the people.
They deliberately threw to the winds
the fair prospect of success by honest
methods to invite defeat by clumsy tac
tics of political dishonesty. The suspi
cion is aroused that railroad
influences, which recently gained con
trol of the Democratic machine, were
brought to bear in the Republican
County Committee.
The Republican taxpayers and
voters, sustained by a large following
of the Non-Partisans, asked for the
simple privilege of electing decent,
reputable citizens to a municipal nomi
nating convention, but Crimmins and
Kelly, taking counsel of political
rounders in a barroom, instructed the
committee to present a scheme which
would deprive the precincts and As
sembly districts of direct representa
tion in the convention^
The Republicans of the city will find
some way to set aside this latest de
cree of the local boss. Good citizens of
every shade of political sentiment may
unite to down the bosses, the dema
gogues and the monopolies.
or nobody. This widened the breach
and Gage remarked that Burns was
getting a little too careless.
Shortly before Burns took his Shasta
trip the Governor and he had a tiff
about something, the precise nature
which has not been learned. It is known
that the Governor told Burns that if
his incumbency proved unpopular it
was the fault of the colonel.
These affairs are what led the Gov
ernor to grow diffident about the extra
session. Certain men are now working
hard with the Governor against an ex
tra session and Burns will cut his .
Shasta trip short on account of hurried
information sent him that he is needed ;'
"on the spot."
BUCKLEY WOULD
MAKE A TAMMANY
HE PLANS TO STAY AWHILE IN
SAN FRANCISCO POLITICS.
| The New County Committee .Will
Consider a Lasting Organization
Along With the General
Election Programme.
... â â
The Buckley faction of the local Democ
racy has planned and resolved to become :
the Tammany of all of San Francisco. |
The Buckley organization is to [follow j
closely the plan of the Tammany organi- I
zation of New York by being constituted
on a plan so thorough and far-reaching
that it will be represented by an organiza
tion in every precinct in the city.
This thorough organization is to be
maintained far beyond the primary cam- |
paign for which the existent political
clubs are supposed to be organized. When
the coming primary campaign ani the
succeeding municipal campaign are over
the organization now being perfected is,
according to the plan outlined, to be con
tinned for the purposes of future cam-!
paigns. This ambition Is, of course, one â 
thing and its realization another.
At the second meeting of the Buckley
Demo rati'- County Committee in the new
rooms of the faction in the Baldwin An
nex last night this plan was without dis
cussion forwarded by the appointment of
a committee "to consider the advisability
of making it a permanent organization,
consisting of S. Sullivan, J. D. Condon, L.
Dunn. J. Carew an.i S. H. Smith. This
provisional county committee, which met 1
last night, will go out of existence as a
county committee when the Democratic
municipal convention names the legal !
Democratic County Committee under the
primary law, and the "permanent organ
ization" mentioned in the resolution is '
the. permanent and Independent Buckley
Democratic organisation described and
planned.
Tier- was a larÂ«re attendance at the '
meeting last night and the highest qual
ity of oil in the market lubricated tin har
monious proceedings. The main business '
transacted was" the appointments of im-
I portant committees, There was appointed i
a committee of eighteen "on manage
ment." to supervise all matters of organi
zation and all election and party affairs i
not relegated to other committees. This
was the first appearance in San Fran-
Cisco politics of a. committee "on man- I
agement."
Then there was also provided in the '
quickly adopted report of the committee !
on by-laws and order of business named
at the last meeting a committee on "har
mony." one of eighteen on "district
clubs.' one to have charge of Headquar
ters and a finance committee. It was de
cided to temporarily designate the organi
zation a*- the "General Committee of As
sociated Democratic District Clubs of San
Francisco."
In some of the districts toe existence of
two clubs brought about a postponement
of nominations for district representation
on committees and the committee on
"harmony" will be named next week. The

FATHER AND SON ARRESTED.
Immediately after the performance of
the "Flying Banvards" at the Olympia j
last night. Officer H. McMurray of the ;
California Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children , served a warrant on
Bert Banvard, the father of Fritz Ban- j
yard, the 9-year-old boy who is the fea- |
ture of the act. The officer proceeded un- j
â  der the ordinance which makes it a mis- :
demeanor to allow any child under 14 ]
years of age to engage In an acrobatic act.
The boy was also arrested, but both se
cured their release upon Manager Walter
stein depositing $40 cash bail for their ap- |
pearance in court to-day.
Secretary Wadham of the Eureka So- :
ciety was on hand to witness the act, and j
says that he will arrest the father and j
Waltersteln to-day. It was a pretty con- j
test between the two societies, in which
the California, organization won out.
Manager Waltersteln says that he ia |
perfectly willing to comply with the law. !
but claims that the Banvards appeared |
for three weeks at the Chutes and were]
' not molested, and. their act was done in
mid-air, which he would not allow at the
Olympia; where it is performed on hori
zontal bars six feet from the floor, with a
net underneath.
The hoy Fritz was seen after the per
formance and showed no had effects. Pro
fessor Mlehling of the" Olympic Club has
< pronounced him one of the most perfect
specimens of boyhood he had ever seen.
I Secretary Wadham claims that harm to
| the hoy 'may not result immediately, but
' it will In time.
Charles L. Ackerman, attorney for Mr.
, Waltersteln, In. discussing the subject,
said: "The act. provides that if the ex
hibition is injurious to the physical wel
; fare of the. child it can be prohibited. It
also discriminates, inasmuch as It confers
on tin- Mayor and the â¢ Supervisors the
power to permit any such exhibition. For
that reason the statute cannot stand and
has been defeated in* numerous cases."

PEOPLE OF THE CITY
ARE UNJUSTLY TAXED
... * - -. . v
Gross Discrimination Is Shown in
Favor of the State.
Merchants Make New Criticisms of the Assessment
Made by Dodgeâ lnterior Counties Take
Advantage of San Francisco,
THE assessment of city and county
property made by Assessor Wash
ington Dodge is still a matter of
deep concern and comment to lo-
cal merchants. While it is uni
versally conceded that the Assessor
was justified in raising the property
values of corporations and banks, mer
chants insist that he has failed utterly
to make a just equalization of city and
county values. More than this, it is
claimed that he has discriminated
grossly against the city and county and
in favor of the State, placing San Fran
cisco more than it ever was before at
the mercy of the interior counties of
California.
There is a disposition on the part of
Assessors of interior counties to reduce
their assessments this year and thus
inflict upon San Francisco a double in
justice. Assessor Dodge has increased
the assessable values of city and coun
ty property 000,000. The Assessor of
Alameda -has reduced the total assess
ment of that county $1,250,000. There
is every indication that every other in-
j terior county will follow the step taken
I by the county of Alameda.
People of San Francisco will there
| fore have to face a double disadvantage
I owing to the assessment placed by
Dodge. Even if the interior counties
j did. not reduce their assessments San
I Francisco will have to contribute two
! hundred and fifty thousand dollars more
j than it should rightly be asked to do.
. Under normal conditions this city and
county contributes one-third of the
i revenue of the State government. Un
der the increased assessment made by
I Assessor Dodge the city will be com
â  pelled to contribute nearly 50 per cent
iof the revenues of the State, If in ad
; dition to these conditions the interior
! counties reduce .their assessments, San
Francisco will be enormously overtaxed
to support the State government.
Every dollar that is taken from the
! taxable values of the property of the
interior counties is added to the taxable
j value of San Francisco property. It is
i this unjust discrimination on the
| part of the Assessor that has drawn
PROFESSORS PRESENTED
WITH HANDSOME TOKENS
RECEIVE GOLDEN GIFTS FROM
THEIR STUDENTS.
Senior Class of College of Physicans
and Surgeons Honors the
Faculty. .
At the conclusion of the final exami
nations of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons held last night in the institu
tion on Howard street, four of the pro-
| feasors were called before the senior
! class and presented with valuable tokens
I of the esteem In which they are regarded
by the pupils who have listened to their
wise counsel during the past term. Sev
eral of the students made the presenta
tion speeches and the grateful recipients
â¢responded In feeling terms.
The first one to receive the substantial
appreciation of intending practitioners
was Dr. Edward S. Howard, at present
acting professor In surgery in place of
Dr. Joseph R. I. am.-. Dr. Howard was
presented with a handsome golu match
box studded with costly jewels. ,
Dr. J. S. Asay. professor of dental
pathology and therapeutics, received a
gold-headed cane; Dr. John F. Dillon,
professor of materia medica. was placated
by a silk umbrella with a mother of pearl
and silver Inlaid handle, and Thomas
Morffew. president of the dental faculty
and professor of operative dentistry and
dental histology, was consoled with a
jeweled gold watch fob.
After the presentations the company ad
journed to a downtown restaurant, where
the health of the professor'- and the stu
dents was drunk in bumpers of sparkling
wine.
The graduating exercises of the College
of -Physicians and Surgeons will be held
at the California Theater next Wednes
day'evening.-.-Ninety graduates will re
forth from the merchants their vigor
ous protest. They do not find fault
with the Assessor for having made his
increase of taxable values in the cor
poration and capitalistic classes, but it
is urged vehemently that he should
have kept the aggregate down to $350,
--000,000. ,
He has made no equalization of prop
erty values, nor will the injustice of the
assessment be only temporary. The
State Board of Equalization has been
too eager in the past to increase the
San Francisco assessment and it is not
by any means likely to reduce it after
the Assessor has made his estimate.
Through the enormous increase of city
and county property values people will
also suffer under the charter, which
provides that there shall be a dollar
limit on every one hundred dollars on
a total assessed valuation of city and
county property, whatever that valua
tion may be. Under the charter, there
fore, the people of the city will have a
dollar limit on a total assessment of
four hundred and seven millions in-

stead of on a total assessment of three
hundred and fifty millions.
The experience of most of the great
cities of the Union has been that a j
high rate an.i low assessment is pre- |
ferable to a low rate and high assess- '
ment. It is asserted also that Assessor
Dodge Is not entitled to the exclusive
credit of increasing the assessment of j
a great deal of property that hitherto
had escaped taxation. Expert Piatt of
the committee on personal property i
of the Board of Supervisors rendered I
much valuable service to the Assessor
in uncovering property that had before
escaped taxation. This is particularly
true in reference to the assessment of
merchandise in bond, of premiums in '
course of collection, of franchises of
insurance companies, . of corporation
stocks held here but secured by tangi
ble property outside of the State.
These criticisms of the policy of the As- j
sessor have gained wide currency and
promise to make interesting the ses
sions of the Board of Supervisors when
it meets as a Board of County Equali
sation.

the Champion Swimmer.
Miss Ida A. Killey. the champion lady

presented with a silver medal yesterday
morning by a number of her friends and
admirers, all members of the Pollywog

FROM THE HORNS
OF A DILEMMA
Gossip Caused by His
Hasty Vacation.
WHAT RUMOR HAS TO SAY j
. aâ
SEEKS TO EVADE THE MESHES
OF THE "DOG ORDINANCE."
A Trip to Yosemite Just at a Time j
When His Presence Is Urg
ently Needed in San
Francisco.
aâ
Mayor Phelan started on a trip to To
semlte Valley somewhat hurriedly last I
: Thursday night, and yesterday it was
gossiped around the City Hall that his
j Honor is artfully dodging some exceed
j ingly important Issues which he does not
I care to go squarely for or against. This j
, gossip may or may not have any founda- :
; tion, out It is regarded as most peculiar j
i that he should rush off just at this time, j
when so many serious matters demand his j
attention. Instead of waiting until August, j
when the Board of Supervisors will take
' a vacation. 'â â '.'- â **
For instance, there is the tax levy with |
its manifold complications to be straight- j
ened out. Last Monday the Mayor prom- !
ised to confer with the Finance Commit
., tee regarding the levy, hut when Chair
, man Perrault of the committee sought to
l Induce him to fix a date for the confer
ence the Mayor somewhat .testily replied
I that any time in the course of a couple |
Of weeks would do. .'_'[â¢ V." .-". "".'"".
Then again the Election Commissioners
are extremely anxious to have the Major
in attendance when they act upon the
matter of allowing the Registrar addi- j
I tional help, and In deciding upon the bal
lot for the primary election, hut those are
matters that cannot be delayed and so the
other Commissioners must get along with
out his advice. * â¢â¢- - â ?>.'.â 
When the subject of Mayor Phelan s
r hasty departure from the city was
broached yesterday and an explanation
sought the knowing ones winked and [
asked where the Mayor stood in regard
to the "dog ordinance."
The "dog ordinance," so called, is that
which passed the Supervisors last Monday '
' without a dissenting vote. It provides i
! that pool selling and betting shall be al
lowed on .coursing matches within the
i city and county sixty days in each year,
and it is stated that the strongest pres
: sure from many sources was brought to
bear to secure its. passage. The matter
; was not discussed at all and not a voice
was raised against it. |
Now it is claimed the dog ordinance ,
removes the embargo on the Ingleside |
race track and that Corrigan and his
crowd may re-establish their game at the ,
old stand again next fall without any in- !
terference. The original ordinance clos- I
Ing Ingleside was general in Its terms and ,
included coursing as well. But the new
ordinance. It is stated. Is special legisla- j
tion and as it repeals part of the original
law and discriminates against horse
racing it must necessarily repeal the
whole act. ... . -._
That is where the joker comes in. The
same Influence that was used upon the
Supervisors has undoubtedly been ex- j
erted upon the Mayor to get him to sign !
i* but those know-alls intimate that his
Honor, realizing the far-reaching effects .
of the new law. found himself between .
the horns of a dilemma and sought safety
in flight. If he signed the order, they say. i
! lie would Stultify himself in regard to '
: the stand he has taken on the Ingleside j
i track and if he vetoed it he would call ,
1 down upon his head the vengeance of the |
! powerful supporters of coursing. So he i
â  Suddenly found it convenient to take a
vacation and will allow the new order to ;
become a law without his signature. there- :
by hoping to carry water on both shoul- j
i ders. ->â  â â ' > â '--â¢
â  Moreover, these gossips call attention
to* the electric franchises that have not
â  vet been signed. The Mayor's opposition
to granting any more franchises until the
new. charter becomes operative was well i
! known, but as soon as the Merchants' ;
Association declared in favor of them the ,
Mayor's hostility suddenly ceased. Still l
Mayor Phelan cannot be expected to have :
much love for the Market-street company, I
and rumor has it that if he can evade '
signing the franchise orders he .is not
likely tr strain himself in his eagerness i
to aftix his signature thereto. it is point- j
ed out that by withholding his signature |
the Mayor might hope to continue In i
favor with those who opposed the grant
ing of the franchises, while by refraining
from vetoing them and allowing them to
become operative he. would not Incur the
displeasure of the Merchants" Association, i
Hence Ins trip to Yosemite just at this j
critical stage
Of course this is mere rumor and the
Mayor may yet put the gossips to blush
by signing the "dog ordinance" and the
franchises. The former was passed last '
_^_^_^^t^'^^^^^-^
Monday, but owing to the holiday on
Tuesday Its publication could not begin
until Wednesday. That -uruld leave until
next Saturday for the Mayor to sign or
veto it.
Colonel Sullivan, Mayor Phelan's secre
tary, when asked when his Honor would
return, replied "In a few days."' but could
not or would not give the exact date.

.HILD'S PECULIAR DEATH.
Suffocated by Large Pillows Which
Propped It Up on a Bed.
The seven months' old child of George
Kotta, residing at 4 Scholl street, came to
its death in a very peculiar manner yes
terday afternoon. . It was smothered by
pillows which propped it up while it's
mother was out of the room. During yes
terday afternoon Mrs. Kotta had her baby
bolstered up on the bed between two
large pillows while she did her sewing.
About Â»: o'clock her duties called her to
some other part of the house and she
left the room alone. Upon her return, ten
minutes later, she was horrified to find
the little one's head stuffed down between
a large pillow and the wall. She imme
diately pulled âºthe child from its position,
but found that' death had ensued. The
child had fallen over and become suffo
cated before help could reach if. The
Coroner was notified and an investigation
will be held.
