Ships in Water Pageant Passing in Review Before Dewey on the Olympia, Off Grant's Tomb
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â N0 Roman
conqueror returned to his tri
un ph? of barbaric splendor; no
victorious king or prince com
ins home from a successful
war, ever received such a magnificent
ovp*ion as overwhelmed Admiral
Dewey to-day as he stood on the bridge
of the Olympia at the head of a mag
nificent fleet of steel thunderers of the
deep, followed by a thousand vessels of
peace, each tiered and coated black
with people and sailed over the bright
waters of the upper bay and up the
broad pathway of the sunlit river,
whose banks were gay with millions of
flags and streamers dancing in th
wind.
The sky was blue, the water rippled
under the fresh wind that held out flags
straight and jaunty ad the wharves
and piers and rocky heights and grassy
knolls were b!u ( >k with frantic, enthusi
astic people, who strove weakly to
make their shouto heard above the per
fect bedlam of tooting whistles that ac
companied the admiral ashore and
afloat.
As the tomb o-f General Grant on Riv
erside drive was reached the fleet paid
Its tribute to the memory of the great
warrior with a national salute of twen
ty-one roaring guns. The fleet then
anchored and reviewed the almost end
less procession of craft that steamed

they looked as if they would turn turtle
before they got back to their piers. To
ward the end the parade became disor

ganized and it took hours for the heter
ogeneous flotilla to get by. Darkness
at last brought relief to the tired ad
miral who had stood on the bridge for"
six hours, bowing his acknowledgments
to the stentorian, expn ssion of homage.
New York has never witnessed
thing before- approaching this wonder- I
ful, remarkable demonstration. The '
(""luniblan naval parade, the dedication
of Grant's tomb and thp reception of
the North Atlantic squadron last fall,
all pale before this gigantic ovation to
the sailor, who, in a singlo morning, de- !
Etroyed <in enemy's fleet without the j
loss of a man or a ship. It is not be
v< ad the mark to say that turee million
po.,pif> viewed the pageant from ashore,
and that a quarter of a million were
afloat.
Wnen New York turned out to the i
celebration this morning a light hnz.
bting over the harbor, but this was soon j
'1 up by th*- bright sun which j
bathed sea ami city in its brilliant rad- '
iance. The wind was strong and gusty i
and kept the flags snapping.
People who went down the bay were i
lost in admiration of the display of
bunting along the water front. On the '
East River, from the bridge to the Bat
tery, where the sailing craft lie In
droves, the spars were covered with
such a mass of color as might be com
pared to a maple grown hillside in the
deep autumn. Tho tall spars of the
cliprers were conspicuous fir their en
signs and signals. Every craft in the
harbor was decked out from stem to I

stern with all the grace and attractive
ness known to shippers. But the dis
play in the East River was not to be
compared with that of the North River,
up which the procession was to pass.
Fi"':i tl,.- peaks of every pier long
ropes strung with flags of every, hue
were stretched to the snubbing post at
the corner, the fronts were decorated
with a multitude of gay devices. There
were flags on the staffs and lines of
flags above the ropes.
The vessels at their sides wpre dress
ed from stem to taffrail and some car
ried flags on their yards and had
their deckhouses covered. The wind
shook the banners from millions of win
dows, porticoes and even steeples and
never, perhaps, in this generation did
hearts that love it bound so quickly to
the sight of the flag. T T p the river, far
off on thp Jersey shore and big-h on the
misty PalisÃdes it gleamed.
The best place from which to view
the great marine panorama was natur
ally from the deck of the Olympia, and
by the courtesy of Admiral Dewey an
Associated Press representative was
permitted aboard. Very early the fleet
of steamships, yachts and tugs which
were to have a place in the line began
moving .down the bay to the allotted
points where the seyera! divisions were
to form, but many of them could not re-
Fist the temptation to first visit the
anchorage of the men-of-war off Tomp
kinsville, and before 11 o'clock the
Olympia was surrounded by a perfect
mob of every known kind of craft, all
j swarming with people, circling around
I or pushing their noses close under the
j ship to got a glimpse of the admiral
j pacing the quarterdeck. The bands
aboard the excursion boats played and
the whistles and sirens of the other
j craft made the air hideous by their
shrieks. They kept coming, coming, in
I pairs and half-dozens, until they lay
a dozen deep, resisting the charges of
| the patrol boats in their determination
â to get up within shouting distance.
I Their recklessness was amazing. They
I ran across each other's bows, they
I rubbed against one another, they
! push^'l bow on stern, until further
movement seemed paralyzed by the in
extricable confusion. It was with
i. great difficulty that the police could
J clear a passage for the admiral's
j launch when he went off to return the
official visit of the Mayor at noon, and
when he did step into his launch the
patriotic skippers afloat grabbed their
whittling cords and made the hills
echo with such a blast as can only be
j heard when a Yankee yacht crosses
the finish first in a race with foreign
mug-hunters. And that was simply
' the prelude to what continued through
| out the day â an almost continuous roar
of steam whistles.
Meantime the vessels to take part in
the parade were massing over near the
Long Island shore, until that side of
the harbor became a tangle of stacks
and "flags and framework as far as the
eye could reach. The grassy slopes of
Wadsworth and Fort Hamilton and the
wharves and shores of Staten Island
were covered with sightseers, watching
the fleet below. The warships lay spick
and span ready for the start, their bur
nished metal flaming in the sun, their
sides white as virgin snow. Between
them and the shore lay the low, long,
lean, wicked-locking torpedo-boats rfnd
Btill, inside of them, the graceful flo
tilla of revenue cutters.
Aboard the Olympia the marines and
sailors had been critically inspected
from the toe of the first marine to the
jaunty cap of the last sailor. All
seemed a little dazed at the prospect
before them, and no doubt many wuuld
have preferred a programme involving
a duplication, of the Manila fight to the
ordeal they were to go through. The
officers of the fleet did not wear their
showy uniforms, but were attired in
specia! undress "A," as it is technically
known in the navy.' There were no gold
epaulets, gold-bound beavers and clat
tering swords aboard. This was the ad
miral's order and added but another to
the many evidences of his unique mod
esty. A brother and the widow of Cap
tain Gridley, who fought on the Olym
pia in Manila Bay; Co-lonel Frank
Rartlett, former Representative in
Congress from New York, and an inti
mate personal friend of the admiral, to
gether with three newspaper men, were
the only civilians aboard. One of the
naval guests was the engineer of the
Olympia when it led the way past Cor
regidor Island. He was given three
rousing cheers as he went forward to
see the men.
Immediately after Admiral Dewey re
turned from Sandy Hook the wig
wagger on the bridge signaled the fleet
to prepare to get under way. The
gangway.-- wore hauled up and the
booms rigged. An old quartermaster
hurried a small dark roll of bunting to
the main, hand over fist. It hung there
while the bugle sounded the caU to
quarters and the marines were muster
ed aft. Then, just as the signal to
weigh anchor was given, a pull on the
halyards opened the roll and spread the
four starred flag which Farragut flew
as he ran the forts in New Orleans. It
was the flag which was presented to
Admiral Dewey. As it broke, sailors
at their stations and the marines on
the quarter deck greeted it with the
hip, hip hooray we got from our an
cestors. The flag floated proudly all
through the pageant to-day. It is th*
most precious possession of Farragut's
pupil, and when it is struck on Monday,
it will probably be forever, as it is -alto
gether unlikely that Admiral Dewey
will ever command another fieet.
It was exactly 1 o'clock, the hour
fixed for the start when the fleet, with
anchors short hove, began to move,
ships had swung to the flood tide and
were pointing down stream, but with
their twin screws, they faced about as
on pivots and headed for the Hudson,
followed by the long line of vessels in
civic parade. When the ships had
straightened out for their journey
across the upper bay, the spectacle thf>y
made will ever be treasured In the

memory of those who saw it. In ad
vance of the ' >lympia was a double
line of patrol and flreboats. a lilliputian
fleet to cjear the way of unofficial tres
passers. It did not require much per
suasion either, as the skippers had a
wholesome respect for the steel ram of
the mighty sea monsters. .
On the port beam of the Olympia was
the escorting ship Sandy Hook, with
! the Mayor and other dignitaries aboard,
and in her wake at intervals of 400
yards, stretched out a mile long, were
the great towering warships, the ar

with people, were almost criminally

them listing so far that one wheel was.:

of signal flags ordered the vessels of

the men-of-war ran up rainbows of sig- ;

to] masts. The order was beautifully
executed except aboard the flagship, [
where the fouling of the line in the

Admiral Dewey instantly roared out '
a command for some one to ease the
line. It fouled again and a nimble sailor
was sent aloft to clear it. It was per
haps two minutes before the flags were i
in their proper place. The admiral was
plainly displeased. He sent for the j

was executed and called him upon the |

'I am ashamed of this," he said, in
the tone of a sailor giving command

DAZZLING THE
ARRAY OF SHIPS
IN THE PARADE
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â The naval
parade from the vantage points
of the warships was an immense
marine picture, a water pageant
with so little of incident com
i uith its great size that it ap
pealed to the eye as a painting rather
thai] a drama.
The vast gathering of water craft
Biaintained an average speed of eight
â  knots, but so magnificent was its area
that the impression whs one of exceed
ingly slow and stately movement. The
picture was continually changing, but
! it melted so slowly and in such meas
ured rhythm from form to form that
the sense of motion was largely lost.
It started under a brilliant sky, pass
| ed at the mouth of the Hudson through
' the threat of an ugly *torm and
' emerged through a rainbow arch that
! stretched from shcre to shore into a
| clear and brilliant sunset off the Grant
j tomb.
The night had been a busy one in the
i fleet of warships off Tompkinsville.
! The last details of the day"s ceremony
; were hardly settled befoie the day Itself
; broke on a scene of greater activity
i than the classic anchorage had ever
witnessed before. The great vessels of
the white squadron Bwur.g at their an
chorage as for the past two days, bill
: the crowd of neigrhb iring craft had
swelled past counting. As 0 r as <>uld
- en the water was a mass of mov
ing steamers. It was a moving, shift
i ing picture of tugs, polio boats, flre
boats, torpedo boats, yachts, launches,
tramp steamers and ocean liners and
Eailing craft of every kind, wiili big
ferry excursion boats plowing their
way through the ruck in mysterious
paths that opened before them and
closed again behind them like the ice
of an Arctic floe.
The only stable points in the scene
at that early hour were the warships. |
They lay like a great white grounded '
1" rg about which the pack-ice turned i
and swirled without moving them from
their moorings. It was a morning of i
repn ssed excitement on b ard the New
York and the other ships behind the i
Olympia. Everything had been < leaned
and burnished from ram to rudder.
N ; was ushen d in with h scream of
whistles that Bounded like ten thousand
craft. The last far-away echo had
hardly drifted back from the Staten Isl*
and hill;? when a sudden impulse seem
ed "to ielze the far-reaching mass of
tuns and other Â« rn ft. [nstead of drift
ing idly round and round the warships,
like ships in an eddy, they began' to
steam away to the south in parallel
lines as though some current mere
bearing them oul t" sen. But as they
vanished in scores toward the Narrows !
there were hundreds more that swept
down from up the harbor. Then there
was a scurrying home of the white
hooded steam cutters of the warships.
The great boat cranes amidships reach
ed down their grappling hooks and
whisked the pinnaces aboard. Mega
phone commands flung across the water
brought the torpedo boats to heel like
the greyhounds they were at the Olym
pia's quarter. The brilliant code flag?
blossomed like flowers on the Olympia
from bridge to maintop. It was the or
der to form in column. The Brooklyn's
pennant snapped "Aye, aye," from the
sign,'; yard and a duplicate set of flags
passed the order to trk- Indiana, whem c
it was (lung from shin} to ship down the
squadron. The black speed cones of
the Olympia climbed slowly to her
yards as the big cruiser got under way.
The other vessels slowly turned, like- a
troop of cavalry squadron, front toward
the Narrows, and then fetching a
graceful sweep, headed back up the
harbor toward the Battery, the iMym
pia, escorted by the Mayor's boat, the
Sandy Hook, in the lead.
Back of her at a 400-yard interval
came the New York, then the powerful
Indiana and Massachusetts, the fleet
footed Brooklyn, the sturdy old Texas,
(he rakish, yacht-like Dolphin; the old
Lancaster, a relic of another naval age;
the powerful Chicago, and fin/illy the
little Marietta, the rear guarcl of the
fighting craft. Behind stretched th^
transports, and farther still, almost
lost in the distance, the yachts and
miscellaneous craft hull down on the
horizon.
The evolution began at 1 o'clock and
in fifteen minutes the fighting line was
straightened out up the harbor. Ad
miral Dewey was going to his own
place at the head of a squadron that
would have won at need three battles
of Manila Bay without stopping for
breakfast.
The head of the column was a broad
arrow. Six torpedo boats spread out as
the bar, three on a side, from the
Olympiads quarter. Outside of them a
flying wedge of police patrol boats
formed a great V, whose apex was the
Olympia. Flanking them, ahead and
astern, were the harbor fire' boats,
spouting great columns of water that
turned threateningly toward the ex
cursion boats on either side when they
attempted to crowd the line of march.
But the pageant back of this power
ful vanguard was not limited to a sin
gle nor a sextuple line of ships. It was
a sinuous marine monster half a mile
wide, whose vertebrae were the ships
of the white squadron and whose ribs
were rows upon rows of every sort of
floating thing that had ever run by
steam in New York harbor. Thou
sands viewed the spectacle as it moved
up past Staten Island, thousands more
watched it from the anchored craft
that crowded the Erie basin and whose
spars rose in a forest about the foot
of Liberty. But they were forgotten in
the mass of humanity that crowded
the water front of Manhattan Island
and filled every point of vantage along
the Jersey shore.
This feuture of the scene first broke
on the view as Castle William roared
an admiral's salute to the Olympia off
the Battery. By the time the answer
and smoke had died away from the
wake of the flagship the immensity oÂ£

t lie watching crowd dawned on the
crews of the squadron. Every foot of
the city water front was a mass of hu
manity. The wharves, the ferry slips,
the roofs of ferry ami warehouse rose
one above another in solid blocks of
people. Above the lower structure of
the water front every roof bore its liv
ing freight. Stores, old office buildings
and modern skyscrapers were crowded
with stands, tiers upon tiers of Beats
likt an immense threater whose roof
was the sky, whose walls'were the sur
rounding hills and whose back drop
was the horizon of the lower bay. As
the pageant moved majestically Into
the Hudson it was seen that the
crowds still lired the water front and
housetops thicker, if possible, than
ever, and stretching up the river along
the whole line of parade. The Heights
of the Jersey shore were also crowded
with parti -colored masses of people.
They were not such an unbroken rank
as along the wharves of the New York
Bide, but wherever the w led Blope
broke into a clearing the slope wrts
blackened with people from crest t i
water line. There was no possible way
itimating the crowd. The morning
papers declared there were 1,500,000
visitors in the city. The Impression
conveyed by the crowded shores was
that it would have taken thai many in
addition to the local population to
form the concourse that watched th^
water pageant. The spectators might
have bee*n computed in army corps,
certainly not by individuals.
Up the Hudson pandemonium
reigned supreme. Aerial bombs broke
at intervals overhead in puffs of
white smoke, and a feathery canopy of
steam hung over the advancing fleet as
hundreds of steam whistles -screamed
continually. The narrowing throat of
the river crowded the advancing ves
sels together in an almost compact
mass. The broad arrow formation still
drove the head of the column forward
unmolested through the ranks of the
waiting vessels. Storm clouds that
had gathered down the bay followed
close in the pageant's wake. A sharp
wind bred whltecaps even in the nar- ,
row river, and a few raindrops pattered
on the decks. The glare of an angry
sky turned the harbor behind the war
ships to molten lead, upon which the
gigantic figure of Liberty seemed to ;
stand for a time and was soon swal
lowed up in a bank of gray haze. Then
the threatening sky relented.
The sun broke out ahead and painted
across the sullen clouds a rainbow arch
that stretched from Manhattan to the
Jersey shore. It seemed a bit of na
ture's art work spread by a kingly mir
acle at the opportune moment, beggar
ing man's more humble efforts on shore,
but forming a fitting arch of triumph
beneath which the victorious admiral
sailed to his triumphal anchorage.
The old Portsmouth's, crew manned
the ringing as the Olympia passed, and
off Grant's tomb the naval reserves on
the St. Marys did the same. Round the
stakeboat the Olympia turned smartly,
her guns throbbing a deep throated sa
lute to the resting place of another na
tional hero. The other vessels of the
white squadron swung around the St.
Marys in turn, each saluting the tomb,
though at the head of the line the sound
of further guns was lost In the roar of
steam whistles.
The turn of the parade broke the for
mation of the police boats beyond re
pair. The warships doubling back into
the mass of advancing boats threatened
for a time serious consequences, but the
Olympia and her consorts safely drop
ped* anchor at last in reversed column
and the water pageant passed the ad
miral in review. The police boats re
appeared as individuals and uncere
moniously shouldered intruding vessels
out of the line of march. The official
procession and its varied following of
tugs, launches, steam dredges and ex
cursion boats rounded the St. Marys
and came down the river in an indis
tinguishable aquatic mob that was still
passing long after the night illumina
tion had begun.
From the time the British yacht Erin
started she certainly was the chief at
traction along the river front after the
Olympia had gone by and Sir Thomas
Upton was accorded an ovation all
along the line. To those on board the
Erin, decked out as she was with flags
of all descriptions, it looked as if the
American people were greatly pleased
with Sir Thomas and were delighted
with an opportunity to give him a
hearty welcome. They ran alongside in
tugs, barges, launches and big excur
sion steamers and shouted all sorts of
complimentary things to him, while
the tall yachtsman on the upper bridge
of the Erin wore a smile all the after
noon and not infrequently called back
I his thanks for the kind wishes. Sir
I Thomas had on board fifty or more of
I his friends on this side of the water
j and from England, and the company
I during the latter part of the afternoo"n
were kept busy returning the cheers
which Avere hurled at the Erin from all
sides. Among those who watched th*
parade from the decks of the Erin were
i Prince Reginald de Croy of Belgium
and Hon. Charles Russell of London.
â¢ Even before the Erin had weighed
anchor, half a dozen tugs had come
alongside, and the cheering and whist
ling rang in the ears until the end of
the day began.
After thi- signal for the start was
given, the Corsair led, followed by a
magnificent string of steam yachts
smothered in flags in two long lines.
The Erin headed the starboard column,
with Colonel J.-hn Jacob Aster's Xour
mahal right astern, while the Niagara.
with Howard Could on board, headed
the port column, with the new Joseph
ine of Joseph N Widener right behind
her. The Erin was continuously sa
luted on the way up and the man on
the after deck, beside the flagstaff,
which carried the big yacht pennant.
was continuously dipping it in return.
"Everything seems Ur be going first
class," g%id Sir Thomas, as the yacht
neared the Battery, "and the parade
is certalnlyja great sticcess.
Looking "v.-r through the tremendous
crowd thai covered the wharves and
Battery, he shouted down to those on
deck: "Just see them over there: did
you ever see so many people? It is
wonderful, marvelous! I could not be
lieve that so many people could be got
together." When off Twenty-third
street, Sir Thomas became exercised at
the congestion of the boats ahead and
shook his head as he thought of the
chances of getting the Erin through the
mess. In gÂ«.-ing by the training ship
Portsmouth th*- Jackie* lined the rail
and gave the Erin a tremendous cheer,
which was answered from the crew of
the Erin on the far deck. Then came
more cheers, yells and vhistles from
those on shore, until Sir Thomas 1 Bides
fairly shook with laughter as he said,
"They must all have money on the
Shamrock."
It t<rok nearly an hour for the head of
the yacht fleet to roach the turning
point off Fort Lee, but the Corsair fin- j
ally swung around and headed down to
ward the Olympia. At the same time
half a hundred excursion boats, tugs
and launches which had been waiting
up the river frrr the yachts to appear
joined in, so that a solid column came
sweeping down on Admiral Dewey.
The Erin was in the center of this great
mass of boats and the formation of the i
yacht dub fleet was at once lost j
The great mass swept by the Olympia
five and six abreast, but fortunately l
the course was . comparatively clear
when she went by and Admiral Dewey I
was easily recognized, waving his hat
frantically at Sir Thomas as he stood j

Olympia also recognized the Erin and
gave her a tremendous cheer, which
was returned by the entire company on j

PYROTECHNIC
AND ELECTRICAL
DISPLAY AT NIGHT
NEW YORK,- Sept. 29.â Never before
in the history of New York has this I
city witnessed a greater pyrotechnic |
and electrical display than that with J
which the return of Admiral George
Dewey was celebrated in the harbor
and waters surrounding the island of
Manhattan to-night.
The great hulks of the battleships of I
Dewey's fleet silhouetted against the i
dark background of the sky shone from
stem to stern with myriads of incandes
cent lights, while all around innumer
able brilliantly decorated yachts and
other river craft honored the nation's
hero.
Cro.wds occupied every point of van
tage along the New York shore from
Grant's tomb to Fifty-ninth street.
One hundred thousand people, men,
women and children, at a (Conservative
estimate, saw the illumination from
Riverside drive.
Sir Thomas Lipton's yacht Erin
was brilliantly lighted with streamers
of white lights and the name Erin in
green between the masts.
From the bay the letters on the
Brooklyn bridge "Welcome Dew.ey"
were plainly discernible and were one
of the features of the celebration.
Ab if to join in the popular acclaim to
the great admiral, nature lent her
I forces to the display of fireworks, for
j the sky was illuminated frequently dur
i ing the evening with flashes of light
ning, showers at times interrupting
skyrocket proceedings, though but
I slightly dampening the good nature of
i some of the crowds. There was seem
j ingly no end to the display of fireworks.
Â©very wharf landing and pier had its
| quota of sightseers, and the enthusiasm
was abundant. From the housetops as
well as from the sidewalks powder by
: the barrel was burned and. rockets sent
; aloft in honor of the hero of Manila.
Over on the Jersey shore the display
| was just as generous, and the sky wa.s
I lighted with the blaze of fireworks,
making the surrounding seas bright as
.midday. Brooklyn and Staten Island I
contributed to the general and gener
ous burning of powder.
The fireworks float Mars, loaded with
fireworks and aglow with those being j
j displayed, took fire in the East River
I and instantly blazed up, frightening the i
| twenty men on board, who at first at- j
j tempted to jump overboard. The blaze I
was started by the sparks setting fire j
to a tarpaulin which was used to cover i
i a lot of skyrockets, Roman candles and !
I the like, and those were sent flying Jn ,
j all directions. With the assistance of \
the police boat officials the men on the |
, float succeeded in checking the flames, j
j but all the fireworks were destroyed.
DEWEY PRESENTED WITH
A HANDSOME MEDAL
NEW "YORK, Sept. 29.â Mayor Van
Wyck, on board the Olympia, to-day
presented Admiral Dewey the freedom
of the metropolis and a medal. The
Mayor's presentation speech was as fol
lows:
Admiral Dewey, with pleasure and
by direction of the city of New York
1 meet you at her magniticent gateway to
extend to you in her name and of her
million visitors, the leading citizens of
forty-live States, representing almost
every hamlet in the nation, a most cordial
welcome, congratulating you upon being
restored to your faiuily and home.
A loving and grateful nation is glad
dened by your safe return from the most
remarkable voyage of history, so far
reaching in its results that the clearest
mind cannot yet penetrate the distance. It
has already softened the voices of other
nations in speaking of ours, changed per
manently the mail of the world, enlarged
the Held of American pride and completed
the circle of the empire in its western
course.
Your courage, skill and wisdom, exhib
ited in a single naval engagement of a
few hours, brought victory to your coun
try's arms, and then you dealt with your
country's new relations tt> the world with
the judgment of a trained diplomat. By
common consent you have been declared
warrior and statesmanâ one who wears
the military uniform until the enemy sur
renders and then dons the habit of the
diplomat.
The greatest reception awaits you that
was ever tendered a military "or civil
hero. Such an outpouring of the people
was never dreamed of before. Never lias
the heart of America turned with such
perfect accord and trusting confidence to
one of her sons as it does to you.
I place at your disposal the freedom
and unlimited hospitality of the city of
Xew York.
Admiral Dewey said, looking at the
Mayor's stenographer: "You're not go
ing to take down what T say, are you,
Mr. Mayor? I never could make a
S] eh."
Mayor Van Wyck smiled, and Mr.
Harvey went on making his notes.
"Mr. Mayor and gentlemen," said the
admiral; "of course it would be needless
for me to attempt to make a speech, but
my heart appreciates all that you have
said. How it is that you have overrated
my work I cannot understand. It is be
yond anything I can conceive of why
there should he such an uprising of the
country. I simply did what any captain
in the service would have done."
"Admiral," said the Mayor, "no
tongue can ever utter or pen write an
overestimate of what you did fJFy>uv
country." m
. Admiral Dewey smiled and bFs cheek
flushed .with proud color unxnÂ»r the
bronzed skin. He shook the hHnd of
the Mayor, who then reached into his
pocket and drew out a nvdal of honor
which the city voted to the hero of the
war with Spain, saying:
The city of New York had made to com
memorate this reception to you, the hero
of the Spanish- American war. a badge, a
facsimile of which they desire 1 should
present to you in commemoration of the
event.
"How magnificent!" exclaimed the
admiral, taking the modal. "How
beautiful! It's splendid!"
Then he called for his Chinese servant
and passed the medal to him. "Pin it
on, sir," he said. to the Chinese. "Pin
it on so it won't drop off."
RELATIVES WITNESS
ADMIRAL'S TRIUMPH
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â One of the
SHIPWRECKED PASSENGERS ROBBED
BY THE FRENZIED, DRUNKEN CREW
MONTREAL. Quebec, Sept. 29.â Two
hundred and fifty scantily clad, bag
gage-bereft men, women and children
were on board of an intercolonial spe
cial which steamed into Bonaventure
depot to-night. They composed the
greater number of those who sailed
from Liverpool on September 15 on
board the steamship Scotsman, bound
for Montreal, which was wrecked on
the shore? of 8 the Straits of Belle Isle
at 2:30 o'clock on the morning of the
21st inst. It was not only a tale of
shipwreck that they had to tell, but one
of death, suffering and pillage, for fif
teen at least of the Scotsman's passen
gers perished, all suffered cruelly from
cold and privation, and, almost the
worst horror of all, the men who were
supposed to succor and assist those
committed to their care in the hour of
need, turned on the helpless passen
gers, and, with loaded guns and re
volvers, compelled thenv to part with
the few valuables saved.
Captain Skrimshire and his officers
were exceptions. For the honor of the
British merchant marine the crime
may not be ascribed to the men en
gaged in it, but to a gang of wharf
rats and hangers-on, picked up on the
docks at Liverpool to replace the usual
crew of the Scotsman, which joined the
seamen's strike on the other side.
The list of those who perished is as
follows:
Pirst-class passengers:
MISS STREET, Montreal.
MRS. CHILDS, wife of the stage
manager of the "Sign of the Cross"
company, which was on board.
MRS. ROBERTS and infant.
MRS. M. M. SCOTT.
MRS. ROBINSON, wife of the man
ager of the Sunlight Soap Company of
Toronto.
MRS. DICKINSON, wife of a former
editor of the Toronto Globe.
Second-chass passengers:
MRS. WATSON.
MRS. TALBOT.
MRS. TUTHILL..
MRS. SKELTON.
MRS. ELIZA WATKINS.
MISS B. WEAVERS.
It will be noticed that all who per
ished were women. This is accounted
for by the fact that they were occu
pants of the first boat which left the
steamer after she struck and which
MARCONI'S SYSTEM
WORKS PERFECTLY
Apparatus to Be Used Durirjg the
iQterQatiorjal Yacht r^aces
Fully Tested.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â From the chartroom of the steamship
Ponce messages were flashed by wireless telegraphy this afternoon
across the city and over New York harbor and bay to the station at
Navesink Highlands. Other messages were received in reply. Both in
sending and receiving the apparatus established by Marconi for the
purpose of reporting the international yacht races for the Herald and The
Call worked perfectly. After it was all over Marconi expressed him
self as entirely satisfied with the tests. Tnose who had the good for
tune to be on board the Ponce during the parade carried away with
â¢them interesting souvenirs in the shape of duplicate copies of the first
message sent by wireless telegraphy over a considerable distance in
this country.
With her towering foremast the Ponce attracted great attention as
she passed up the river first in line after the division yachts. Riggers
were at work upon the steamship until 9 o'clock in the morning lash
ing to the foremast the spar which carried the connecting wire, 140 feet
into the air. As soon as the riggers finished their work Marconi set up
his apparatus, established connections with currents of the upper air
and was ready for his assistant at Navesink to call him.
It had been expected that the first signal would be received at
about 11 o'clock, but the noon hour came without results. Marconi be
gan to grow nervous and announced that in all probability the work of
installation at Navesink had not been completed, in which case, of
course, no tests could be made during the afternoon. After he was
nearly exhausted, just thirty-four minutes after midday, a spark flashed
to the receiver, which began to tick off the first message.
most delightful features of the day was
the hearty way in which the members
. of the Dewey family enjoyed every de
| tall of the tribute to their great kins
man. Under the guidance of Edward
Wilkins Dewey, a nephew of the ad
! miral, who has been a New Yorker for
I years, the family party left the Wal
j dorf-Astoria for Battery Park, where
they boarded the steamer Sandy Hook,
Mayor Van Wyck being in waiting for
I them.
Charles Dewey, the admiral's elder
I brother, was the dean of the party. His
i wife and son and son's son were with
! him. There were M.rs. H. H. Finiey, a
! niece of the admiral, and her daugh
j te/, Miss Frances Finiey, and Mrs. Ed
; ward Wilkins Dewey, James L. Martin,
; Mrs. Martin, Miss Martin, Fred A.
Howland and Mrs. Howland. William
T. Dewey, James F. Dewey, Mrs. Kate
Squire, Mr. iind Mrs. Frederick B. Mc
â¢Cune, George P. Dewey, Lieutenant
and Mrs. Theodore G. Dewey, C. Wol
cott, Miss Wolcott and C. S. Wolcott.
"This is the grandest celebration I
have ever seen," said Charles Dewey,
after the parade, "and I am an old
man and have traveled much in this
country and twice in Europe. I have
geen triumphs and celebrations there.
Not one of them ever began to approach
this in magnificence and beauty. It is
the Lord's day. He is with us. The
skies are bright and the sun is smiling
upon us-. Everything contributes to the
success of the pageant. We heard a
great deal before we came here about
how great the triumph would be, but
nothing like this stupendous outburst
ever entered our minds. The love and
admiration of the American people for
the admiral is wonderful."
DEWEY DAY oisERVED
IN SANTIAGO DE CUBA
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 29.â
Dewey day was observed here with a
patriotic demonstration by Americans.
The Government fcuildings were gayly
decorated and all/ the tugs in the har
bor blew their wh'stles. While the cele
bration was general among the Ameri
cans the Cubans took no part in it.
In an editorial in El Cubano to-day
exception is taken to the remark of
Admiral Dewey that the Filipinos are
as capable of self-government as the
Cubans. The editorial concludes by
saying that Cubans have had enough of
intervention and that clean machetes
cut keonlv.
DEWEY HAS SATISFIED
ALL SHADES OF OPINION
LONDON, Pept. 30.â The Times, in an
editorial tracing Admiral Dewey's ca
reer, says: "Not the least remarkable
part' of the celebration is the fact that
Admiral Dewey has manifestly satis
fied all shades of opinion. There is no
was swamped before it could get clear
of the ship.
Entering the Straits of Belle Isle on
Thursday night, the steamer ran into j
a dense fog. At 2 o'clock in the morn- i
ing there was a shock underneath the j
keel of the vessel, followed by another i
and still another. The passengers were
asleep in their berths and were all
awakened by the shocks and hurried on
deck.
The thick bank of fog shut out the
sight of shore. A superficial examina
tion of the ship told Captain Skrim
shire that she would be a total wreck
and must be abandoned, at once. A
port lifeboat was lowered and in this
many of the women and children were
placed. Hardly was it clear of the ship i
when it capsized, throwing its occu
pants into the water. Those who per
ished were in this boat. Some were
saved, tor the ship had listed to port
and several women were washed back
on the deck. One woman clung to a i
rope for two hours before being res- I
cued.
Meanwhile disgraceful scenes were
being enacted on board. Hardly had the j
vessel struck before the men from the |
stokehole rushed into the cabins and.
slitting open valises and bags with their
knives, took all the valuables they could
lay their hands on. Several of them
fired shotguns and tried to force men to
leave their cabins.
It is said that some of the steerage
passengers joined the firemen in looting
the baggage of the first-class passen
gers. In more than one instance rings
were turn from the fingers of fainting
and dying women. Captain Skrimshire
and his officers could do nothing against
the mob.
When morning came it was found
that the Scotsman lay close inshore
alongside a cliff fully a thousand feet
high. A second boatload of women and
children which had been sent off was
called back and the passengers trans
shipped to the rocks alongside the ship.
Until 6:30 the officers and some of the
crew of the Scc-tsman worked unceas
ingly in getting the passengers ashore,
and when darkness and a heavy fog
set in they were safe on the rocks. But
here the new danger of starvation
faced them. The lower decks of the
phin v.ere entirely under water. A
quantity of biscuit was carried on shore
and on this, with a very little corned^
beef and wild berries, over 200 people
existed for four days. Some natural
springs were found, but despite this the
! record of a single jarring note to mar
; the harmony of the occasion. We in
â  England can have no more pleasant
I duty than to congratulate America
upon the possession of her gallant sea
men and her exhibition of legitimate
pride in that possession. We feel sure
nobody in America will question the
J propriety of the considerations which
deterred Canada from allowing a de
tachment of the imperial forces to take
official part in a celebration that must
I necessarily recall painful memories to
another nation with whom we maintain
traditional relations of * peace and
; friendship. The vast majority of Amer
: icans unquestionably appreciated Eng
i land's friendly attitude during the war,
| but we doubt whether that could any
i where be so cordially appreciated as
! among the American sailors, who hail
1 special opportunities of putting it to the
I proof all the world over in their daily
; relations with the British navy. We do
not believe, that the seeds of friendship
thus sown in the two countries are des
tined to remain sterile or to yield only
an ephemeral harvest of empty pro
fessions of good will."
STREETCARS WERE
CROWDED WITH TRAFFIC
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â At least
2,300,000 persons were passengers on the
street railways to-day. The elevated
railways carried 1,000,000 persons, and
practically all on the Sixth and Ninth
avenue lines. The Metropolitan llnea
carried about 1,200,000 persons, and
this traffic, too, was confined almost
entirely to west ' side lines. About
75,000 persons rode on the Third avenue
line.
Transportation facilities on all rail
ways entering New York were heavily
taxed, and the street railway traffic
was the heaviest in the history of the
companies. Officials of the companies
predict, however, that to-morrow all
â transportation records will bÂ° broken.
The "managers of all railways dread
the rush which they expect to-morrow
when the Dewey celebration ends. They
estimate that, including + hose who will
arrive to-day, there will be at least
1,500,000 visitors in town, and the ma
jority of them will want to go home at
once. At all railway stations all pos
sible preparations have been made for
handling the crowds. Ordinary time
tables will be abandoned and trains
will be run just as frequently as is con
sistent with safety.
TROOPS FOR THE
BIG PARADE TO-DAY
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â 1n New York

camped to-night. Major General Roe
says there will be 23,000 soldiers in line
to-morrow. Nearly all the troops are

brought on- much sickness. Many of the
passengers suffered from the exposure.
After much difficulty some overcoats
and shawls were secured far the
women, nearly every one of whom had
left the ship in night clothes.
The passengers were obliged to climb
up a rocky cliff nearly 300 feet high be
fore they could find a place large
enough to rest. Here they stayed on
the rocks for four days and nights. Tha
first night they had absolutely no shel
ter, but on Saturday the captain sent
up blankets and other, clothing. A
number of passengers attempted to
reach the lighthouse, which was about
eight miles away as the crow flies. To
do this it was necessary to climb ,:bout
1200 feet higher before a path could be
reached.
It was not until the 26th that the
Montford came along and was <ignaled
by the Belle Isle light, where a number
of passengers walked from the wreck.

BOERS HAVE NO NEW
PROPOSALS TO MAKE
LONDON, Sept. 29.â A dispatch to the
Times from Pretoria says:
"It is generally expected that a strUe
of war may be proclaimed at any mo
ment. President Kruger granted me an
interview to-day and declared he had
done all possible for the sake of peace.
He had accepted Mr. Chamberlain's
own offer of a common inquiry, but Mr.
Chamberlain deliberately broke the
thread of negotiations, troops were
massed on all sides and war was forced
upon him. H<- said it was impossible
to accede to the- dispatch of the 12th.
"Such a course would hay given the
land and people Into the hands of
strangers. Ass it was, his seven years'
proposal would, according to the Beld
cornets' books, enfranchise 50,000 per
sons, which was more than the whole
number of the old burghers, yet not
one has come forward to take it. The
CJitlanders never really wanted the
franchise. From the first they refused
tn go on the commandoes and regis
tered, themselves as aliens. Afterward
Lord Loch secured exemption for them
on the same terms as the Portuguese
had. He wished to indignantly deny
Mr. Chamberlain's charge that he had
broken his promise made .luring the
discussion preceding the Pretoria con
vention <>f LBBI, that he would treat new
immigrants equally with the old burgh
ers. He had always been ready to treat
them so, and they had always refused.
" 'In conclusion I asked if there was
still a possibility of peace.
" 'No, 1 he replied, adding:, after a
pause, 'unless the other side will do
something to make peace possible.' "
The correspondent a.dds that perhaps
it is worth pointing out that the com
mando in question did not arise until
1594, after the franchise had been re
stricted by the law of 1891, "which
makes it difficult to see why the former
should accept the latter."

ARBITRATION MAY
BE RECOMMENDED
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 29.âDis
cussing the attitude of Germany in re
gard to the Transvaal crisis, the Rossia
says:
It is still an open question as to whether
Russian diplomacy, on the basis of The
Hague conference, may not make the ex
periment of reenmmending that Great
Britain and the Transvaal have recourse
to a court of arbitration. In view of the
hostile feeling against Great Britain, it
is very possible that numerous volunteers
from Europe will to thr aid of the
Boers, as Russian volunteers aided Servia.
[f <;i"iit Britain attempts to prevent such
movement Russia, perhaps, will speak a
decisive word.
MANY VOLUNTEERS
FROM THE COLONIES
MELBOURNE, Victoria. Sept. 29.â A
conference of the military command
.ints <>f all th-' colonies except N^w
Zealand is sitting here to discuss the
equipment and dispatch of an Austral
ian force to South Africa. Volunteers
are coming forward largely from all
the colonies. About 1400 Victorians
have already volunteered.
DURBAN, Sept. .29.â The summoning
of the volunteers has caused wide
spread excitement. The men responded
t'eadlly and 800 troops with numerous
guns will entrain to-morrow.
OTIS' STORY OF
THE FIGHTING
â â¦
He Tells How Porac Was
Captured.
Sjwial Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Sept. 30, 10:15 a. m.
â General Otis and General
Schwan are visiting Angeles, the
northernmost town held by the
Americans. The visit is possibly
connected with a conference with
rebel leaders.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.â General
Otis to-day cabled the following report
of tho capture of Porac:
Lawton's troops at Calumplt and San
Fernando, where concentration is taking
place; ordered to cover country Mexico,
(Jruoga, Bacolor and Santa Kita. MacAr
tliur ordered to lake his troops and clear
country west and in vicinity of Porac,
which he did yesterday, advancing to Po
rac at an early hour with Ninth infantry
and Thirty-sixth Volunteers, capturing
Porac and driving enemy north. Whea
ton at Angeles kept back enemy on his
north and moved force westward to in.
terrupt Porac insurgents, but they re
treated l>y mountain roads. Results, dear
ing the country preparatory to future ope
rations. Our casualties at Porac. five
wounded. Wheaton does not report any
casualties. Captured one officer and sev
eral enlisted men, .some twenty of the
enemy killed; number wounded unknown.
From General Otis' dispatch of to
day it is evident that operations
against the* insurgents north of Manila
and west of Porac are to be pushed
with vigor. This also is the plan of
Secretary Root. It was asserted at
the War Department that a crushing
campaign will be inaugurated at the
close of the rainy season. The purpose
of tho present campaign is to clear the
country along the Dagupan railroad of
all hostile natives. General Lawton has
been ordered to assist in the general
advance and to concentrate his troops
in the vicinity of Calumpit and San
Fernando. The concentration of such
a large body of troops north of Manila,
it is believed, indicates the opening >f
a campaign with a view of driving the
Filipinos into the hills, where they will
be cut off from all supplies and muni
tions of war.
MANILA, Sept. 29.â An escaped
Spanish prisoner who has entered the
American lines says that General Mas
cardo, with 800 insurgents, began to
retreat out of Porac yesterday as soon
as the' place was attacked. He moved
to Calumpit, a mountain stronghold to
the westward, where 1500 other Insur
gents were massed, and where also the
rebels have powder works.
Four prisoners from the captured
American gunboat Urdanetta were In
Porac and were taken to Calumpit by
the retreating enemy. Five other men
of the crew were killed.
Letters regarding the return of the
American prisoners now in the Philip
pine Islands are passing both ways.
TWO MEN PERISH IN A
POWDER=MILL EXPLOSION
Portion of the California Powder
Works Plant Near Santa
Cruz Destroyed.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 29.â Another seri
ous explosion occurred at the Califprnia
Powder Works near this city to-day. Two
workmen, Joseph Steiner and L. Larsen,
lost their lives. The mill that was blown
up was the fuse corning mill, which is
located near the double wheelhouse. The
building, which was only constructed last
year, was modern in every respect. It
consisted of three sides of masonry work,
with an op^n front, surmounted by a gal
vanized iron roof. As usual the direct
cause of the explosion is a mystery. Be
yond the blowing off of the roof the build
ing was not damaged to any great extent.
The loss cannot as yet be estimated, but
It will probably foot up In the-neighbor
hood of JIOOO.
The amount 'of powder stored away In
the mill could not have been much as the
report was not very loud. Another indi
cation that goes to show that there was
little powder in the mill was the condi
tion of the bodies when found. Instead
of being blown to atoms, as is usually the
WILD EXCITEMENT IN THE
SOUTHERN GOTTON EXCHANGES
NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 29.â The wildest !
I panic ever witnessed on the floor of the
New Orleans Cotton Exchange occurred |
I to-day shortly after business opened, and
caused, In the midst of the excitement,
the complete suspension of future busi
j ne.Â«s pending the investigation of what at
j the moment was assumed to be a conspir-
I aey to swindle the Cotton Exchanges of
\ the country. The panic was due to an ap
parent terrific jump in the price of cotton,
has. d on alleged Liverpool advances, and
; it was roughly estimated that $170,0(K> had
been lost on the local transactions as a re- j
suit, l^ater in the day the exchange, j
: after receiving legal advice, declared null j
i ati'l void all future transactions of tre
day. This action, however, promises to
be bitterly contested, and litigation s
I likely to be the final outcome. Business
I here will not be resumed until Monday.
The market at Liverpool opened 3-32 d
lower on spots and 4-64 d lower on deliv
j cries as compared with yesterday's values,
and continued without mfiterial change |
for some time. Then the wires became !
hot with tales of rapidly advancing prices.
They started up one-half of a sixty-fourth J
at a time at iirst. and then jumped until.
the not advance up to 9:45 local time!
showed 41-64 d. In the meantime New Or- |
Jeans had opened under the Influence of i
the Liverpool market, advanced twelve to
fourteen points higher than last evening's
closing and quickly climbed thirty points j
additional.
Then the explosion came. With an un- j
accountable advance of tifty-four points |
facing them, operators began to receive i
cablegrams from Liverpool asking the
reason for the heavy gain in prices in this j
market, and stating that prices In the j
English market still stood at about the i
opening figures. These cable advices, in |
the CacÂ« of from fo,stt to 50,000 bales Bold
! and purchased, threw the operators into a
frenzy of excitement, and they surged,
shouting, yelling and gesticulating, about ;
the ring as President Parker rushed to
his desk and summoned, without Lhe
usual formalities, a meeting of the cx
i change. Amid tumultuous scenes a mo
| tion to Buspen i business was gasped out
: by a wildly excited broker, and with a
tremendous shout it was unanimously'
carried. The news of the excitement of
the ilop in the meantime had spread like
wildfire through the business districts,
and Carondelet street in the vicinity of
the exchange and the bucket shops were
soon thronged with excited men. Man
' ager West of the Western I'nion Com- !
pany, as soon as he got wind of the sen- i
sational advance, set his wires to work
with messages of inquiry to New York.
Replies came promptly, directing that all
; specials in reference to Liverpool fluctua
: tions be held until they could be confirmed
by the 4 p. m. report.
In the face of these reports and the j
advices from Liverpool, President Parker i
convened the directors early in the after
noon, and it was then concluded to close
the futures market until Monday, in order
to permit brokers to recover from their
shock and enable an investigation to be .
concluded fixing the blame for the re
markable blundering or the responsibility :
for the conspiracy. At the same meeting 1
the board summoned its counsel, E. I). I
Saunders, and asked an opinion from him
as to the legality of the contracts that
had been made under the misapprehen
sion.
"Having been informed that all con
tracts made this day," said Mr. Saunders
"were based on false reports from Liver- !
pool as to price, I advise you that the
consent essential to a valid 'contract was j
wanting, and the contracts therefore are I
void."
Upon the basis of this opinion the con- 1

I case, they were recognizable. The sup
position is that the victims were first
rendered unconscious by the concussion
' of the explosion and then burned to death.
I The body of Steiner when found was
in a crouching position on the floor, while
only a ft-w feet away lay the rlgrid form
of the unfortunate Larsen, stretched out
lengthwise.
With the exception of Charley Holcraft
none of .the other workmen had narrow
| escapes. The former, who had only been
i transferred to another mill this morning,
j can consider himself fortunate as he cer
i talnly would have found a last resting
' place' with the unfortunate Steiner and
! I^arsen had he been compelled to remain
| in the mill.
Both Larsen and Steiner have been era
â¢ ployed at the works for some tlmÂ° and
! were considered experienced workmt-n.
j Larsen was a married man and leaves a
wiilnw and daughter to mourn his loss.
Joseph Steiner was a well-known young
i man and has always considered Santa
i Cruz his home. He has parents residing
j here and was unmarried. He was 32 years
I of age.
tracts were declared off. The curbstone
brokersâ or at least some of themâpro
tested against the action of the board in
declaring contracts 'void and claimed that
they were not governed by the exchange.
Other brokers were likewise of the opinion
that the exchange had exceeded its au
thority and threats were freely made
during the afternoon of a resort to liti
gation to determine whether the contracts
should stand or fall.
To-day is the first time in its history of
thirty years that the New Orleans Cotton
Exchange has been compelled to suspend
business. During the panic of 1893 a sim
ilar .attempt to suspend was made, but
failed. The exchange took the ground
then that suspension would injure it In
the markets of the world. The directors
feel that to-day's suspension was unavoid
able and excusable.
A statement In relation to to-day's
panic was given out by officials of the
Cotton Exchange late this afternoon. Re
ferring to the false Quotations, the state
ment says:
All of the Liverpool dispatches quoted came
thrnUÃh thr regular channel, the Commercial
News Buraau of thfÂ» Western Union Telegraph
Company, which has been the news conductor
for the various Southern exchanges for more
than a quarter of a century past. The expla
nation of the company is that the changes nj
ported were to be construed as against the
closing price of yesterday, but as the invariable
custom heretofore has been to give all changes
In the Liverpool market compared with the dis
patch Immediately preceding; the explanation
is not only unsatisfactory, but indicates negli
gence somewhere little short of criminal.
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 29.â When the re
port of a rapid rise in cotton became
known here to-day the locaj brokers were
Hooded with orders to sell. One order was
as high as 4uOO bales. The excitement was
intense, with no' abatement until the ad
vices from Liverpool denying the rumors
of the rise in prices were twice confirmed.
One cotton merchant is said to have
bought 20U0 bales at 7^ cents on the
strength of the quotations, byt the brpkers
as a rule were cautious..
GALVESTON. Tex.. Sept. 29.â The Liv
erpool quotations caused an exciting hour
on the Cotton Exchange to-day. Later
all trades were declared off and th" loss
on futures will be small. It is on cintry
purchases that the rub will come Be
cause of the supposed advance in Liver
pool prices factories rushed telegrams to
their buyers in interior towns raising the
limit for spot cotton. A sale of one lot of
100 bales at Houston at fifty points more
than the true market price is reported.
The hanks received telegrams from their
correspondents from many points in the
interior calling for currency. A promi
nent banker stated this evening that over
a quarter of a million dollars in bills
was shipped from here this afternoon. It
is not likely that many of the spot trans
actions will be called off.
HOUSTON. Tex.. Sept. 29.â The local
cotton men went wild to-day on the Liver
pool quotations. The brokers could not
handle the business. It Is believed many
country merchants have been hard hit on
actual cotton purchased when the early
quotations were ssnt out, and failures
may result.
MOBILE. Ala.. Sfpt. 20.â Mobile cotton
men were staggered by the Liverpool cot
ton reports and there was very little trad
ing. It is impossible to estimate at pres
ent the amount of sales in the Interior
upon false reports, but it is thought to be
large, as the market has been bullish for
several days and buyers would be quick
to act on such reports as came early to
day.
Reception to Major Rice.
RAKERSFIELD. Sept. 20.â The people
of Rnkersfiel'i gave Major F. S. Rice, late
commander of the California Heavy Artil
lery, a rousing reception this evening at
Scribner'p Opera-house. The major taiked
for two hours of his experience in the
Philippines, after which he came down
and shook hands with his fellow towns
men.

GUNMEN WILL
BE READY FOR
FIELD SPORTS
Elaborate Preparations for
Shooting Wherever the
Law Permits.
Although under the State law the season
for duck and quail shooting opens to
morrow, tportsmen will find but few
places open to them. The Supervisors of
the various counties are' given the power j
to amend the State law. Prompted by
associations Interested in the preservation
of game the Supervisors of many counties
have extended the close season. Thus it
will not be legitimate to kill quail or
ducks in some parts of the State until No
vember 11
Mendoclno, Napa, Solano and Contra
Costa counties have made no change in
tin Plate law", hence gunmen may shoot
at will over their broad acres. There Is
it growing â einirhem nnpan-iii toward the \
preservation of roe birds. It. is ex- I
petted that next year all the counties
will have passed ordinances extending the j
close season on Â«iuail and ducks until j
November l. The second broods of quail
are still too young to fly, and it would .
lake but a few momenta to wipe out whole |
bevies. . .
The best duck shooting to-morrow
should be on the preserves I . about Solano
County. Many mallards have bred there,
and the grain-baited preserves have at- I
tracted otner*-. The birds have not â¢ come |
in from the north In any numbers as yet, !
out the lirst heavy storm will send them
southward. Ibe preserves about Alvarado ;
are dry and comparatively iÂ«'W ntrds have j
been Been there. The bombarding they:
will get about Suisun to-morrow will, ;
however, send some of them south in
quest of a more hospitable feeding place.
The season will open in the counties
which are usually shot over by the
sportsmen of this city as follows:
Alarneda- October 1; rail, October 15,
and quail. November 1.
Contra Costar-Dueka anil quail, October 1.

Thirty members of the Olympic. Gun
Club have expressed a desire to shoot over j
the Cordelia preserves to-morrow. As
there are but twenty shooting stands at |
the present time lots are to be drawn to i
determine the lucky men to whom they [
will be assigned. Persons drawing a j
shooting stand may if they desire Invite j
a- fellow member or a guest to share their i
good fortune. Those who do not have an j
opportunity at ducks to-morrow will find
quail near at hand on which they may ;
test their skill as field shots. Five addi
tional stands are to be erected for the
duck shooters at once. When the rains* I
come and the area of the ponds is In- I
creased the shooting facilities will be still
further added to. The members expected
on the preserve to-morrow are:
F. V. Bell, J. O. Jensen. H. K. Rose, H. H.
White. Howard Black. W. 11. Phelpa, A. F.
Hoepke, W. A. Marshall, Dr. A. T. Derby,

ters, E. Hlrschel, W. H. Roussel.
Possibly the finest of the clubs is that
which bears the title of San Pablo Sport
ing Club. The four gentlemen making up
its membership are E. F. Preston, Achille
Roos, Prince Ponlatpwskl and George
Crocker. They own a fine preserve at San
Pablo, on which they have built a com
fortable shooting lodge, A gamekeeper is
in charge.
The members of the Pringle Gun Club,
which has extensive preserves on the Pey
ton tract, near Suisun, anticipate royal
sport. The ponds have been heavily bait
ed and are reported packed with ducks.
The club is a small one and only members
will be permitted to shoot over its pre
serves. The shooting days are Sunday,
Wednesday and Friday. The members
are: W. H. Bryan, president; Otto Feud
ner, J. A. Wilson. E. E. Long, J. W. Har
per and Edward Hilborn. f
The members of the SuiPun Gun Club
have made extended preparations for the
season and anticipate high class sport. It
is composed of the following: President,
Thomas Robinson; secretary, J. Murphy;
directors, K. Perkins, J. C. Murphy, T. L.
Robinson. James Keys and Alden Ander
son, all of Suisun. Membersâ Klnsey,
San Rafael; Judge Buckles, Solano; Mr.'
Hoytena and J. Smith, San Francisco; R.
J. Boyer and C. L. Diets, Oakland; R. L

Down Alvarado way there are a dozen
clubs, Including the Spooney Gun Club,
Dewey, Pastime, Montezuma and that at
Willow Lodge formerly called the Pelican,
which was composed of prominent Oak
landers, headed by W. W. Foote. The
members of the Spooney Club are: Phil
Bekeart, L. R. Larzalere, J. F. Burfeind
J. E. Miles and George W. Wolfe. Prom
inently identified with the Willow Lodge
Club are Golcher, light, Shaw and other
well-known experts.
A booklet containing engravings of the
most noted pointers and setters in Amer
ica Is being distributed among the well
known field shots by A. H. Phelps. The
press work shows the highest develop
ment of the printer's art. The book Is is
sued by the Hazard Powder Company.
Dr. Robinson and Dr. Vowlnkle left last
night for Oregon on a bear hunt. Dr. de
Marvllle has in contemplation the same
trip.
FISHING ON EEL RIVER.
The best fishing on Eel River at the
present time is to be had at Robinson's.
The flsh at Weymouth's are reported
nnal!, averaging from a half Co thtee
quariers of a pound. The quartet of
Johns â Gallagher, Butler, Samml and
Lemmer â fished Weymouth'si Fortune
and the South Fork, fifteen miles up Eel
River, besides spending one day at Rob
inson*.
Prank Maskey and wife, Fred Lees and
wife, Colonel Kellhor and Charles Fieblg
are at Robinson's. Maskey and Lees will
i-nialn there during October to avail
themselves of the quail shooting.
Mr. Maskey landed a SVpound steel
bead, but this was topped by a six
poundt i secured by John Babcock. Ellis
Robinson secured some weighing fr^m
four to five poundf and many of two and
three pounds weight. The rod wlelders
are not doing bo well with the largo :ish
as they did last year. They are using i>jg
flies for the big tish, the favorites being
the "professor" and the "coachman.
Sharing the popularity of these Is Benn'r,
latest creation, the "Dewey." This is a
brilliant affair of red, white and blbfl
feathers. The truthful fishermen affirm
the fish showed they were up to date by
taking the fly with avidity.
While at Robinson's Al Wilson met
Charles Fiebig, whom he pronounced tne

FIRST GAME ON
THE GRIDIRON
AT BERKELEY
Olympians and Californians
Will Put the Football
in Play.
The football season opens to-day. This
afternoon at Berkeley the Olympic Club
eleven and the University of California
team will meet and will strive f honors
on the field. Both teams have been train
ing for a month and are anxious to test
their strength In actual conflict.
The clubmen are sanguine of victor:'.
With their brawn, ripened experience and
advanced condition they do not entertain
a thought of defeat for a minute. Cali
fornia is not so certain either of victory
or defeat. The college athletes respect
their heavier foes, but the reserve and
covert smiles with which they listen to the
expressed intentions of the Olympic men
may augur something which the Olympics
least expect. Coach Cochran admits that j
he does not anticipate a victory for his
colts, but he has given the Olympics
warning that they will at least feel the
effects of a battle and that they will
realize that a football game was on before
the tinal whistle blows.
The game this afternoon should be of
better quality than the" first game of any
preceding wison. The Olympic Club
never had a stronger lot of men nor a
more harmonious set. They have trained
together during the last few weeks with
out a sign or show of friction and they
are working with a common end in view.
Every evening at 5 o'clock the team as
sembles in the club gymnasium and runs
out to the Pacific Street armory- Then
signal practice, fast and furious, is in
order for an hour. The men run back to
the gymnasium after this and a swim
completes their training. Strict dietary
rules are observed.
The club men will have a center that
will tower over California's midline' pro
tectors. Hobbs In the middle, with Cad
wallader and "Pete" Smith on each Bide
of him, make enough weight of flesh to
terrify almost any center trio in the coun
try. Cadwallader, the pick of the East
two years ago for an all American team,
Is a fast, powerful linesman, and when
he is fortified by two expert football men,
each weighing over -"" pounds, something
ought to give way in front of them. Cali
fornia's center will be the same as last
year, and it is comparatively light. An
interesting problem will present Itself
when they meet to-day. >/â :.'â 
But it Isn't the center alone that makes
the Olympic team. There Ik Sheehy and
Erskine In the tackle positions and Code
at quarter. The- ends are untried,- but
they are equal to the good average end
in a college team. Carter, Thierkauf and
Wilson will play back of the line. All
are good ground gainers, especially when
working in consonance with a line that
is big enough to punch holes into almost
anything.
No matter what the Olympics do with
their superabundant weight, the specta
tors may hope to see some of the old
time gridiron brilliancy when Hall, Smith
or Kaarsburg get the ball and start down
the it. â id. Percy Hall is still with Cali
[ornla and has lost none of his old-time
dash and vigor. Pringle is back and
Whipple is there also, and both have
proved themselves great tackles. Mas
ters, a substitute end of last year's team,
will till Craig's place on the end of the
line. Hopper will -play quarter, the posi
tion for which he was trained last year
but failed to make on account of an acci
dent The line-up for the game, which
will be played on the Berkeley campus
at 3:30 this afternoon, is as follows:
California. Positions. Olympics.

ON STANFORD FIELD
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sept. 2*.-
Th.- football season is rapidly advancing
at Stanford. Each evening the bleachers
i are crowded with spectators, while the
field is covered with between eighty and
ninety candidates, all of whom are anx
ious to make a place on one of the two
i teams that are to uphold the honor of the
I cardinal this fall.
With such an abundance of material and
I enthusiasm Stanford is also fortunate in
having the strongest corps of coaches she
has had for years, if not the strongest in
! all her history. Coach Chamberlin is as
sisted each evening by "Jack" Reynolds,
the star half in 95, and Charles Lowers,
another of Stanford's old players. Each
| of them dons the moleskin and puts the
1 men through much individual training for
their positions.
With the return of Burnett and Gilman
Chamberlin hopes to build up a center
trio that will compare, favorably with
that of two years ago. De Forest is ex
! pected to complete the trio by playing his
! old position at left guard. He is consid
ered onÂ«- of the most promising men who
entered college this year, on account of
j his long experience with the Multnomah
| team in Portland.
The freshman team promises to prove
; the surprise of the season. Coach C'ham
-1 berlin does not try to conceal the fact
that he is proud of his "infants." They
' have few stars, and realize that it takes
â  i the whole team to win a victory. What
j they do have, though is plenty of grit
â¢ and ginger. Already they have shown in
â  | their t<m lineups that they know the
â  j game and are not afraid to get into Jt.
They play their first game on the campus
on Saturday with St. Matthew's team,
> and will probably line up as follows: Lee,
t ; center; Traeger, right guard; Graves, left
' i guard; Pollard, right tackle; McFadden,
left tackle; B. E. Nourse. right end;
Lutgerdlng or Welth, left end; Raitt or
Brocherton, quarter; Parker or Allen,
right half; Crowell or Luck, left half;
> Roberts or Cameron, full.
Trainer Murphy, assisted by "Billy"
; IfcLeod, last year's trainer, is working
hard with the men, and the result Is that
" ; not a man is on the sick list. The man
\ \ agement will start the training table
I â¢ rly in October.

, tiatlons arc pending whereby he may take
j Brutus and Frank McComb's great dog,
Royal Flush. In all he wants to take a
: round dozen dogs, and is confident of re
| turning with a goodly proportion of the
; prize money. "Tim " Harrington is also
considering the advisability of making the
pilgrimage. J. Sweeney, Handy &
Smith's trainer, will take four grey
: hounds, the best known being Twin City
Girl and Lady Hugo.
Mr. Low,, .if the coursing firm of Lowe
& Thompson will attend the meeting with
a strong string of dogs, including some
recently imported , from England. After
the Waterloo he will bring his dogs to
this (oast for his h'rst visit bore.
The added money in the Waterloo will
be $60L For the Consolation stake to be
run the following day ?2i>o will be offered.
| This hardly compares favorably with the
stakes off. red here, but the leashmen are
anxious to encourage tho coursing men
of the Middle West, hence the interest
shown in their meeting. The coursing
will be held on the field of the Dallas
racetrack. This is of good size and has
a desirable surface over which the dogs
will run.
1 >. J. Healey has three saplings entered
! at Union P;trk to-day, of which great
performances are expected. They are by ,
Emm Pasha-Wave, and should more than
duplicate the successes of the same i
owner's Rusty Gold-Wave litter. They
were nied out at I'nion Park last Mon
day and one of them, a brindle and white
dog proved a wonder.
â  fene G%ary tried out four Emm ,
Pasha-Bonnie Lass saplings, which
showed hi^h class. They are only ten

B< \ entv pounds each.

Griswoid test some Skyball-Mercy May
youngsters. All were promising, but on--,
railed little Merry, was the most fancied
by those who witnessed the trials.
'The officers of the Interstate Coursing
Club have Hxed the date of their plains
| neetlng for November 15. Should no rain
bave fallen the date may be advanced,
but every effort will be made to run off
I the stake at that time.
W. F. Hobbs' Merry May lias whelped
ten puppies to Young America. Of this
! litter only two are dogs.
T. J. Cronin Is starting two of his dogs
at iiiinn Park tins week for thÂ« first time
In Borne months. He had a disagreement
With ex-"Judge" Bull, and declined to
have him pass on the running of his dogs.
The summary punishment meted out by
the directors of I nion Coursing Park to
men charged with tampering with doers
indicates their desire to preserve and pro
mote the sport on a high plane. Their
action should tend to deter other coursing
men from giving unlawful stimulants to
their dogs.
The management of Ingleside Coursing
Park has decided to limit courses to two
minutes. At the expiration of that time
a fresh dog will be released to kill the
hare. Two minutes Is considered ample
time in which to test the merits of any
two dogs. The rule will save valuable
dogs from injury.
The management is preparing to fence
off the slight rise .in the field to the right
Of the grand stand. The fence will ex
tend from the house used by Slip Steward
i Halpin to a point near the escape.

San Francisco Club Increases
Its Entrance Fees and Its
Membership.
Thomas H. Arnold, manager of the
Western Golfer of Chicago, has been in
California for tho past six or seven weeks,
during which time he has visited almost
all the golf grounds, t>oth those of clubs
j and of private owners. lie considers some
of the links quite good, despite the lack
of sod and grass putting greens; whjle
those at Del Monte are excellent, and
when completed will be fully turfed. He
i has laid out a nine-hole course for the
Casa Loma at Redlands, about a mile to
! the north of the hotel on Orange street,
! near the range of tho dun Club. The
â  course will be 24L'lj yards in length. He
says that he finds few good golt players
i on the Pacific Coast, though many of the
members of the clubs play at w< U, es
pecially when consideration is had to the
fact that they have learned the game
' without proficient instruction, or, as Is
, more commonly 'the case, picked it up for
themselves. He considers the best mi
i Btructors in California are to be found at
D<M Monte, the Presidio and Los Angel>-H.
When the San Franciseu Golf Club was
i first founded the limit set to the number
of members was 200, 100 of each sex. At a
meeting held at the clubhouse last Sat
urday it was derided to Increase the mem
bership to 250, half to be men and half
women. The entrance fee for men was
formerly $l!. r ., and for women $1Â». These
[.. have been raised to $50 and $2."j re
spectively. The dues remain the same as
' heretofore. Visitors' cards are not issued
except to persons whose permanent resl-
I denco is at least llfty mil<?s from San

Owing to the continued illness of Orestes

The Pacific Bull-terrier Club held its
i monthly meeting on Thursday last, Philip
IJ. Fay presiding. The main subject of
' discussion was the Invitation of the Pa-
I cine Fox-terrier Club to send two dele
i gates to the convention of specialty clubs
to arrange for the holding of a joint spe
: cialty show for mastiffs, St. Bernards,
| bull-terriers and fox-terriers. The meet
ing was well attended and opinions as to
| the advisability of holding such a show
: seemed to be about equally divided. Mr.
i Rountree, the secretary, was among the
leading opponents. A vote was taken, re
sulting by a large majority in the deter
' initiation to send delegates. Messrs. Fay
! and Rountree were elected a committt-e
of two to attend the conference.
The St. Bernard Club of California held
i a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the
invitation of the Pacific Fox-terrier Club.
j The sense of the meeting was largely in
! favor of holding the joint specialty show.
Philip Myers and Joseph E. Cutten were
elected a committee of two to attend the
I convention.
The full list of delegates now consists
lof the following gentlemen: For the St.
| Bernard Club of Californiaâ Joseph E.
Cutten and Philip Myers; Pacific Mastiff
Clubâ J. P. Norman and \V. H. Dick; Pa
cllic Fox-terrier Clubâ N. H. Hickman and
J. B. Martin; Pacific Bull-terrier Club-
Richard Rountree and Philip J. Fay.
The board of directors of the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club met on Wednesday and
passed resolutions of thanks to Henry H.
Carlton, the retiring secretary, for his
unselfish and active efforts to further tho
interests of the club. No successor to
Mr. Carlton was chosen, as the directors
! resolved that he be requested to tempor
arily withdraw his resignation, as an as
j sistant would be elected to aid him In the
I conduct of the office.
The Americar Kennel Club held its
quarterly meeting on the 21st inst. and
passed the -new rule affecting champion
ships, modifying, however, the proposed
amendment applying to the Pacific Coast,
so that shows with an entry of 400 dogs
or over score five points in the winners'
class. The actions taken by the Pacific
Coast special committee of the American
Kennel Club were also approved at the
same meeting. The election of Dr. E. N.
Lowry to the vacancy on the committee
was confirmed and the membership of the
committee reduced from seven to five.
The committee is composed of John E. de
Ruyter (chairman) Merton C. Allen, H.
H. Carlton, E. N. Lowry and J. P. Nor
man (secretary). The committee will meet
on Monday next to determine the appeal
of H. N. McCarthy and other matters.

GLADYS BEATS
DOLE'S YACHT
FOR HAWAII CUP
Corinthians Will Hand the
Challenge Trophy Over
to the Victors.
Though the weather last Saturday after
noon was highly favorable to the San
Francisco challenger for the Perpetual
cup, ex-Commodore W. N. McCarthy, who
sailed the winning yacht, believes that
several minutes could be cut from her
time for the course. The Gadder's sailing
time of 3 hours IS seconds was good, being
28 minutes 22 seconds better than the time
made by the sloop Aeolus at the Corin
thian regatta on May 30 under similar
conditions. The 'breeze last Saturday,
however, was fresher than on May 30 and
there was less of the flood tide. The Cor
inthians are satisfied that the Aeolus can
beat the Gadder, but the season is so near
an end that there will "be no opportunity
of pitting them against one another until
next year. After ]asl Satui day's race
some one said that if McCarthy and Pew
exchanged yachts arid raced again Mc-
Carthy would win; but McCarthy himself
has too high an opinion of Commodore
Pew's seamanship to feel sure of any such,
outcome.
The Perpetual challenge cup will ba
handed over to the San Francisco Yacht
Club at some early and- convenient date.
There is certain to be a race for the cup
next year, as the Corinthians will not.
rest content without putting forth their
best efforts to recover the lost trophy.
To-day and to-morrow are open dates
on the programmes of the San Francisco,
Encinal and California clubs. The Cor
inthians will cruise to .Mr.\'> ars Landing
to-day, returning- to-morrow; -and the
South Uays will take an afternoon sail to
morrow.
At the last meeting of the directors of
the San Francisco Yacht Club J. T. Ganz
was elected a member. It was stated that
the ladies of SausaJito have a social club,
which desires k> be permitted to make
use of the clubrooms on week days, except
Saturdays and public holidays.
The South Bay Yacht Club will be the
last to close the season, their final clam
bake being sot for November 12. Th<3
yachts Muriel, Espee and Wanderer will
take long cruises up tv Vallejo, Suisun.
Napa and other towns. S. E. Smith of
th;' sloop Papoose and some other yachts
men propose to go out duck shooting beâ
tore laying their boats by in winter quar
ters, ducks being plentiful in the marshes.
The Coykendalls have purchased a boat
from th. transport Sherman and propose
to turn it into a houseboat. They wilj
then tow it into the marshes of the Sa>i
Joaquin River and use it for duck shoot
ing.
T. W, Hobron's sloop Gladys, which was
built in San Francisco from designs by
V. D. Bacon of Massachusetts and takeii
to the Hawaiian Islands in the early part
of this season, won the Hawaii cup on
September 13. She led her most dangerous
competitor, President Dole's Bonnie Dun
dee, iron: the start, and except on ono
leg of the course, when she was becalmed
increased her lead continually to the finish,
and won by 23 minutes 5 seconds from tho
Bonnie Dundee, which for the past ton
years has beaten all competitors, in Ha
waiian waters.
The Skipper, a weekly log of nautical
matters, published in London, in its issue
of September 13 quotes in full the article,
"Yachting in Hawaii," which appeared in
the August issue, of the Yacht, and uNo
gives a dozen lines of notice to tl>e new
publication. From a comparison "of the
Colum-bia and the Shamrock in the Skip
per it is shown that the over all length
of the Columbia is greater than that of
the Shamrock, but her extreme breadth
is slighUy less. The draught (20 feet 3
inches) of both yachts is the same, but
the wetted surface of the Shamrock (21>ltl
square feet) is greater than that of the
Columbia (2'i7o feet), and the displacement
of the Shamrock (160 tons) is greater than
that of the Columbia < 145 tons). Allusion
is made to the great favor shown to Sir
Thomas Lipton by the American press
but no conjecture is hazarded as to the
results of the races between the chal
lenger and the defender.

BATTLE OF SAN JUAN RE-ENACTED
ON A HAIGHT-STREET VACANT LOT
THE battle of San Juan Hill was re- :
enacted in a vacant lot on Haight [
street, near Fiilmore, Thursday aft- j
erac-on. and for a few minutes the j
residents In the neighborhood saw as I
â  - â â - a sham fight as they ever wit- j
n.ess<=d. ThÂ« combatants were schoolboys,
whose ages ranged from 10 to 16 years,
and the armies consisted of about twenty
men on each side. The lot rises several
feet from the level of the street, and on
top the "Spaniards'' had built intrench
ments and fortified themselves therein.
They were armed with parlor rifles and
the "officers staves as swords.
The American forces, under Colonel
Harry WThitehead, a red-haired boy 14
years of age, who- lives oa Steiner street,
formed for the attack, on Haight and
born m Chicago, and two members of the
company remained behind to look after
the mother and child.
The steamer San Pedro returned to
port yesterday after her unsuccessful
search for the" raft. Captain Zaddart is
of the opinion that a great number o" the
piles will be lost during the tow up the
coast, as they are dropping out one at a
time even now-.

a few minutes pandemonium reigned. The

in a short time several combatants on

The Illness of CorporalLarabee of : the
South Dakota regiment has developed into
unmistakable smallpox" and 'he has been
sent out, to the camp near the fort. His
symptoms baflied the surgeons for a time,
for they were not the ordinary signs of
the disease. Yesterday Dr. Kinyoun.
chief of the Federal quarantine service,
was called in to see the man and he gave
it as his opinion that Larabee had small
pox. This was in accord with, the judg
ment o" the surgeons of the hospital, and
so the patient was sent to the isolated
camp.
La,.. - has been kept in a separate
ward of the hospital since he showed sus
picious symptoms, and no one but his at
tendants and the surgeons have been al
lowed to see him. There are still some of
the men who were associated with him
in his company who- are being held under
detention. The order is out that every one
at the post must be vaccinated.
There has been no increase in the num
ber <:: caats in the Thirty-rirst. and it is
probable the regiment will be allow* to
leave quarantine in. time to get away for
Manila before October 15. The men of
the regiment are getting restless under the
long cetention, but there is no help for it.
ana as long as smallpox shows itself so
long will they rave to remain.
Tne last oÂ£ the Twenty-ninth Regiment
got in from Fort McPherson last evening.
The last sections of the command were
not expected in so soon, but they made
remarkably good time and arrived fully
a day before they were supposed to be
due.
Second Lieutenant William B. Aft of
the Thirty-seventh Infantry is starting
his campaign in, a rather sensational man
ner. He was to have joined his com
mand, which is in Manila, on the Grant.
Orders were out for him toN â  on the
transport last Monday, but when the
Grant left port Aiken was not on board.
He had been celebrating his coming de
parture in a manner not wise and too
extensive, and he was in. no condition to
keep track of transports when the time
for the departure of the Grant arrived.
As a result he was ordered under arrrest,
and yesterday he was before a court-mar
tial, "charged with conduct to the preju
dice of good order and military discipline
in having been absent without le^ve from.
September 13 to September 15. tor being
intoxicated while at the post exchange
and for having: missed his transport.
The Minnesota Regiment is another In
stance of the peculiarities of the military
iaw when applied to volunteers. It will
be mustered out with a' commissary of
the rank of first lieutenant, an Beer de
nied all the other regiments that have
gassed through the mastering officers'
hands. The reason for this is that it had
a commissary Steer when it was i Na
tional Guard regiment and before it was
mustered Into the volunteer service. The
Government would noj muster in the com
missary officer, for it was then declared
that the regulations did not allow such a
position; but now it is declared with equal
gravity and as much effect that there may
be a commissary officer in the regiment
because it had such an officer before it
was mustered In. A. R. de Hath, who
has been acting commissary for the regi
ment, will .be giv-n the commission, but
his rank, will not dat* from the mustering
in of the regment nor will he get pay for
anything before yesterday. The appoint
ment is an admission that the regiment
should have had such an officer from the
start, but the Government will save the
pay. Ray Davis of Company A will be
made commissary sergeant.
G. E. "Talk, adjutant of the regiment.
ha* been raised one bar to a captaincy.
Battalion Sergeant Major John X. Loye
ha* been made a captain in ''- - Forty
fifth Volunteers, and First Lieutenant
Walter A. Johnson a first lieutenant in
the Forty-second Volunteers. â¢
The Hospital Corps of the Minnesota
Regiment, having been merged into the
Hospital Corps of the regular army. has
been mustered out before the remainder
of the regiment.
The payment of the men who came
home on the City of Para will be finished
to-day.
Acting Assistant Surgeon Ernest K.
Johnstone has b<?en ordered to report to
the chief surgeon of the department for
the annulment of hi.? contract.
Acting Assistant Surgeons John J. Gil
huley. Charles A. Cattermole. Thomas K.
Mullins and Fred W. Paimer have been
ordered to proceed to Manila on the trans
port Nelson. Second Lieutenant James
D. Keen will also leav^ on th*Â» \'ptÂ« nn
TENTS WERE CROWDED.
Last Nig at Was the Biggest of the
Circus Week.
If the audiences that find their way Into
Walter Main's big tents at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets each night keep on grow
ing there is danger that that circus may
remain through another week, and John
Harrison, the genial press agent, wants
that made plain to every one. Last night
there was not a seat left around the ring
sides and hundreds who went were either
accommodated in extra chairs brought in
for the occasion or compelled to stand
throughout the performance. The show
was better than ever, though, and no one
found fault- It was the same way at the
matinee in the afternoon. Several hun
dred more of the youngsters from the
orphan asylums were the guests of the
management and made about the most
enthusiastic crowd the circus people ever
had to manage. They were the particular
charges of Colonel William Elliott, who
presides at the "High Sign." and who has
been so long with the circus that no one
knows better than he just wha: the little
folks want. He kept them supplied with
all the pink lemonade they could swallow
and turned them loose in every part of
the big- tents.
Pursuing their usual course, the Mains
are adding- to their attractions as rapidly

PROFESSOR SCHURMAN'S VIEWS.
r~ NKESIDENT SCHURMAN of the Philippine
LJ Commission has given the country some views
1 of imperialism in that distant archipelago
which are of interest and importance. Last year in
his : Ldress at the opening of the scholastic
Cornell University he strongly opposed
king the Philippines, In this year's address, 011
Thursday, he said that, having taken the Philippines,
â¢ th( J uestion at issue is. "What shall we do with
them?" Proceeding, he antagonized nearly every
md which the imperialists have assumed. He de
clared that our assumption of sovereignty over thÂ«
Philippines is entirely unlike our previous national
expansion. Our development from the Atlantic to
the Pacific was over practically uninhabited terri
tory, while the Philippines are already densely peopled
with Malayans, in a physical environment unsuited to
the white man, and are resentful of the intrusion of
other races. This is a ilat and frank admission of
the whole foundation of anti-imperialism. Imperial
c pansion is a novelty before unknown and foreign to
policy, and with no parallel in our national ex
perience. It reaches out for a country to which white
men cannot adapt themselves. Therefore the only
races that can live there are those who are there now.
â  'These are resentful of the intrusion of other races,
â  â  renting at the start all the afflicting elements
race prejudice and pride, tire most difficult of all
gs to overcome. All of these grounds have been
ted by The Call, and we are now
... . supported by the president of McKinley's Philippine
He said further that "to treat the isl
ands as our possession, with which we may do as we
ise, is too barbarous to be taken seriously; it is
not merely callousness of heart, it is only muddle-
The terms "ownership and possession"
he denounced as "a barbarous survival when applied
to any relation between one people and another."
This rebukes the free use by imperialists of the
terms "subject and sub j eel people," applied to the
Filipinos. From the beginning of the unfortunate
affair untrl now those people have been treated as our
subjects, over whom we have the sovereignty, which
in had exercised, because we bought it and paid for
it. ' It is only by considering them as subjects that we
can justify characterizing them as rebels and stigma
tize t!.- ; r opposition t<> the flac^. Professor Schur
says that "our relations with the Philippines will
be 1 tited as long as we retain that fatal con
on of government and property."
This being so, the whole argument of the imperial
ists in justification of their position must be aban
â¢d. They have not a leg left on which to ? and
it, nor a shred in which it may be clad.
The professor, after cutting every bit of ground
from under them, offered his opinion that we arc to
educate and elevate the Filipinos and aid them in
. verning themselves, in fraternal co-operation with
the natives, "whose dearest ideals are the political
litions of Americans." This displaces one discus
sion for another. The country will wait for the pro
fessor's calm judgment upon the effect of our co
ration and aid. offered to a race "resentful of the
intrusion of other races," and "whose dearest ideal is
.our traditions," formed before we took their sov
ereignty by purchase from a power they hated and
had expelled, and appeared among them to assert our
â¢ Boven tgnty by fire and sword, with a demand for un
conditional surrender. He said: "Although Ameri
can sovereignty must be established by force, shall
we ever dream of the policy of extermination?" We
answer that, taking his own statement of the case,
our demand for unconditional surrender is nothing
' short of a threat of extermination.
Nowhere yet in the history of man have conquer
ors aided the conquered in such co-operation as he
looks for. If he is correct in his estimate of their
"dearest ideals," nothing is left but extermination.
His views have increased the harrowing nature of the
â¢" situation. They obsolete the hard commercial view
expressed by Denby and Carter and propose to re
tire it as a motive. For it he substitutes the belief
that we can follow slaughter by elevation, which is
obviously incompatible with his conception of the
"dearest ideals" of the people whom he proposes sha'l
be born into liberty by the Caesarian operation.
TRADE AND IRRIGATION.
COMMERCE is the exchange of the products of
industry. If a people have no surplus of these
products they have nothing to exchange and
therefore have no commerce. A few years ago the
cry all over California was that we were planting
orchards and vineyards 6O extensively that we would
ruin ourselves by overproduction. Still the planting
went on. The surplus increased. Wherever a great
surplus of the articles of. commerce is found the com
mercial ingenuity of man is at work to find a mar
ket The annual increase in our fruit output has gone
on, but the overproduction is not apparent The
State Board of Trade made an exhibit of our fruit, in
all forms, at Hamburg. Immediately the orders from
Continental Europe began to flow in to such an ex
tent that European Governments were driven to find
pretexts for artificial interference with the course of
trade. But this temporary hindrance has not chilled
the mercantile ingenuity of our people, and this year
the driers and canners of California fruit have a
larger market, a better demand and are making more
money than ever.
We are looking for trade in Asia and Oceanicn.
! The means of getting it are not occult. They involve
no sorcery. We need not conjure for it with charms
and invocations, nor seek it with sword and rifle
Wo must find out what the people with whom we
? "> k commercial exchange require, and then must
produce it in larger volume and at a lower cost than
. anybody else, and the trade is ours.
General Chipman has reoently quoted Li Hung
1 Chang to the effect that China has passed the point
of self-supply of food for her people. Her popula
tion has headed and passed the capacity of the rice
crop to feed it. It has been proved in India and in
China that rice-eating Asiatics readily substitute whe.it
. for rice. While wheat is one of the early steps away
from grazing the land with sheep and cattle, and i 9
. not the highest use to which land in California can
be put, yet on millions of acres in this State it must
always remain the best use, because their soil and
situation are not such as to make a change of uses
j profitable. In wheat and other products of the soil
j we must for generations seek that surplus which will
\ be the basis of our trade with the Orient.
This makes stability of production the one over
mastering necessity in our commercial situation. We
say deliberately to the bankers and business men of
San Francisco and the other cities of California which
handle the trade of the State that our future lies in the
; soil. We cannot improve our climate, for it is in
-1 comparable.' None other in the world is so affection
\ ate to the soil. None other kisses it into such de
light of fruitfulness. None other is adapted to win
from the land such a bewildering variety of the com
forts, necessaries and luxuries of life. But the ele
ment climate and the tireless sunshine cannot woo
i crops out of land without water. Water is the
gastric juice of the soil. The land of California is
more productive than other land, because it is richer
in plant food, but that food must have water as its
solvent before it can feed the plant. If the aninvil
: stomach have no gastric juice as a solvent it may be
crammed with food while the animal starves for lack
of nutrition. Without water as a solvent the richest
alluvium shows no verdure and nourishes no plant
life. With water the desert, rich in nil the miner. 1 .!
â¢ elements which the plant cells transmute into human
j food, blossoms and bears like the garden "planted
eastward in Eden."
Therefore let us not be diverted from the funda
mental requirement of California commerce. It is
water, water everywhere.
Our topographical situation is such that all the
water needed forever is ours for the taking. Two im
! mutable laws of nature hand it to us. Evaporation
1 and gravity work while men sleep. Man has no
I monopoly on them, and can neither arrest nor ac
i celerate them. But he may harness them to his pur
: pose.
The proposition to invoke the resources of the
te government to impound flood waters and
thereby irrigate every available acre and bring it into
I action is a proposition to increase our trade with
Asia and with all the world. At present in the waste
i of this water is the waste of all this land that it might
! serve, of all that it might produce, of all the profit of
that production and of all the commerce it would
generate, and of all the taxes the State might derive
; from its advance by cultivation. This is a waste of
ey that might build schoolhouses and maintain
â  .schools, and is a waste of the power of population,
'. which would come if invited by the stability of pro
â  duction which the storage of water will at once es
tablish.
We are reasonable when we say that no land on
! earth ever wasted as much as California by her in-
I attention to this subject.
Every interest here is involved, and all should be
roused to co-operation in the effort to secure the
action of which the State alone is capable.
None can dispute the direct connection between
writer storage and foreign trade, and now when our
: commercial sensibilities are so aroused is the time
: to strike.
If, under the law, a man's house is his castle, what
is a woman's? It's not, according to a policeman
1 who pads the Natoma street beat. On that theory, at
any rate, he arrested a Mrs. Lillie Gray last Sunday
Mid charged her with having committed an assault
with a deadly weapon for having fired a shot at a
former lodger who was trying to force the door to her
I room.
A QUESTION OF TERRITORY.
DEFENDERS of the British in their aggressions
upon the Boers have advanced at one time or
another many curious arguments to justify the
.-i.^yrcssors and condemn Kruger and the stalwart
! patriots who are backing him, but about the most
I curious of all is one put forth by the Philadelphia
I Record in the plea that the Boers have no right to
independence because their country is too large for
the population. The Record says: "It is assumed
that the Transvaal is a compact little republic, and that
! the Boers are in danger of being crowded out of their
j patrimony by unwelcome foreigners, when, in fact,
! the area of the country is greater than that of France.
Th re is not the slightest reason to fear that 100,000
Boers and 200.000 or so of Outlanders cannot live in
j the country without jostling one another, even though
j they should multiply tenfold. Now, it is one of the
unwritten laws of nations that no man nor people
can claim a monopoly of the world's unoccupied
lands, nor of their natural wealth; that these un
peopled places and all they contain are the heritage
of all mankind, and it is the natural right of man to
: emigrate to any locality and abstract from the ground
to which he can obtain a just title the bounties locked
up therein."
If that doctrine be set up as a valid principle of in
ternational law it would be difficult to defend in a
court of arbitration our claims to the territory we
possess in the United States proper, and we could not
defend it at all to what we possess in Alaska. In that
Territory we are now holding an area of land many

times larger than France with a white population
much smaller than that of the Transvaal. The full
absurdity of the argument, however, is appar
ent only when it Is remembered that it is urged in
justification of the right of the British to conquer
the Transvaal. Now the British in Canada, in Aus
tralia and in South Africa claim dominion over large
and very thinly populated regions. The Boer has as
much right to own a country as big as France as the
British have to own a quarter of the earth.
A local controversy over the propriety of placing
an Internal revenue tax upon patent medicines has
disclosed the fact that the national authorities never
intended to tax medical advice. The Government
probably reached the merciful conclusion that that
sort of advice is high enough already.
MARCONI AND HIS TELEGRAPHY.
f* UGLIELMO MARCONI, the expert in wirc
-1 "~~1 less telegraphy, has been somewhat unfortu
nate inasmuch as his arrival in this country
has occurred at a time when the public has no atten
tion to give to any one but Dewey. The yacht race
for the America cup, which is to be reported for The
Call and the New York Herald by his system of
telegraphy, is for the moment forgotten, and his ar
rival in New York some days ago was almost un
noted by a people watching and waiting for the coin
ing of the hero of Manila.
Marconi, however, will have his day in due time.
The success accomplished by The Call in procuring
by wireless telegraphy an earlier notice than any of
its contemporaries of the arrival off the Golden Gate
of the transport with the California Volunteers was
an illustration of the value of the new telegraphy to
practical journalism. That feat will be memorable
because it was the first use of the system in actual
newsgathering, but it was comparatively simple. The
work to be done in connection with the yacht race
will be more complex and more difficult, and yet
there is no reason to doubt it will be accomplished
successfully in every respect.
The man whose experiments have made wirele.;s
telegraphy possible is one of the few men of genius
to whom it has been given to achieve an epoch
making feat at the very beginning of manhood.
Marconi is but 26 years old, and he has been working
at his system only about five years. He began by
trying to send electric messages without wires from
one pole to another on his father's estate in Italy. He
attained some success, and then went to England. Of
late the improvement of his system has been rapid.
When he first came before the public he did no more
than exhibit some amusing experiments. Now he
has given the world an invention of vast usefulness
in many directions.
During the recent British naval maneuvers mes
sages were sent between ships eighty miles apart
across intervening land, and it was thereby demon
strated that neither tall buildings, steel masts, moun
tains nor the curvature of the earth stops the com
munication. Since such things do not count as ob
stacles, it is difficult to set a limit to the extent to
which the new telegraphy may not be extended. The
British are now about to make an experiment of send
ing messages for 300 miles. If that be accomplished
greater distances will next be undertaken, and per
haps before the century closes the age which prided
itself on the electric wire will find the wire useless
and dispatches across the ocean will be transmitted
through the air.
All of these wonderful probabilities are the results
of some experiments made by an Italian youth mainly
for his amusement while a student at the University
of Bologna. They would of course have been at
tained without him, for hundreds of others were work
ing at the same problems. He alone, however, has
had the genius to perceive the value of the dis
closures made by each new experiment, and thus
move rapidly on from one step to another. Marconi
merits every honor this country can give him. He
has done a great work for the world, and fortunately
is young enough to receive in his own person much
of the benefit that will flow from it.
Latest advices indicate that there is much distur
bance in the interior of Jamaica. Can it be that the
brand of ginger for which that country has been so
justly celebrated is losing its grip?
rROM the tenor of the comment on the Ohio
campaign it is evident the imperialists are en
deavoring to make it appear as an appeal to the
country on the issue of imperialism. They declare
the Republican party stands for the imperial policy,
and that every vote for the Republican candidate will
be a vote for imperialism, while every vote for the
Democratic candidate will be a vote against it.
Such pretensions are without justification, but they
are cunningly made. It has been the aim of the im
perialists all along to identify the Republican party
with their policy, and to effect that they have not
hesitated at any kind of misrepresentation. They
perceive ample reasons for feeling well assured of
Republican success in Ohio against such an opponent
as McLean standing on a platform that reiterates the
demand of the Chicago platform for the remonetiza
tion of silver at 16 to i, and with no little craft they
are devising a means of claiming the victory as their
own.
The falseness of the claim has been exposed by tlie
Investigations into the situation in Ohio by a cor
respondent of the New York Post, who asserts that
McLean will not in any way represent the anti
imperial sentiment of the people of the State. He
says: "Of every ten men who abhor and despise im
perialism not more than five can be induced to vote
for McLean as a method of exhibiting this abhor
rence and disgust. The other five will say that the
remedy is worse than the disease, as they will await
a more favorable opportunity for expressing their
sentiments."
The conditions in Ohio are. in fact, of such a na
ture the vote will hardly signify the sentiment of the
people upon any issue other than the general one of
keeping in power the party of prosperity and
keeping out of power the party of discontent. It
happens the Republican candidate for Governor is a
man of known ability and integrity, who when hardly
more than a boy served as a Union soldier and who
in manhood has filled many offices and positions of
public trust with fidelity and efficiency. His oppo
nent is one of the most corrupt men in American
politics, who has been not only antagonistic to the
better interests of the people generally, but a bitter
and unscrupulous faction fighter in his own party.
In such a condition of affairs it is clear that if Mc-
Lean should be elected it would be a proof that the
tide of sentiment against imperialism is running so
strong that the people, rather than give even a seem
ing indorsement to it, will vote against a good man
who has been charged with imperialism by his oppo
nents, and trust their State for a time to a man who
otherwise would not be able to poll the full vote of
even the Democratic stalwarts.
THE OHIO CAMPAIGN.
QUARANTINE AGAINST CONSUMPTION.
While a Pew Newspapers Are of the Opinion That It Is a Step in
the Right Direction, the Majority Regard the Proposition
as Selfish and Inhuman.
THE proposition of the State Board of Health to bar consumptives from
California has excited considerable interest throughout the country. News
papers in all sections of the country comment upon it freely. Some con
sider it a prudent move on the part of the State's Board of Health, but gen
erally It meets with disapproval. The views of a number of leading jour
nals are presented below;
Chicago Journal.
The proposal of a member of the California Board of Health to sia.m tho
door in the faces of consumptives by means of a State quarantine against af
llicted persons seeking to prolong their lives in the California climate is so self
ish and inhuman that it borders on the barbarous. Were it necessary to the
purpose It might have the plea of self-preservation, but it is not necessary. It
recalls the ignorant and panic-stricken shotgun quarantine of the South during
a yellow fever scare, and has not half their excuse. If Californians are afraid
of catching consumption, let them keep away from consumptive persons. The
State is large enough for consumptives and "healthy people, too.
Philadelphia Public Ledger.
If consumption 1b really a contagious disease, and there are Btrong reasons
for thinking that it is, the action of the California board Is strictly in line with
the precautions taken against the diseases mentioned, and while its threat
seema a cruel one, It might be the best thing that could be done for humanity
at large to put it In execution. That course would open the eyes of the peo
ple as nothing else would to the danger which lies in promiscuous and unre
stricted intercourse with consumptives.
New York Journal.
The California State Board of Health by unanimous vote has decided to "con
sider the propriety of quarantining against human beings and domestic animals
with tuberculosis entering the State.". This is the first step in a direction In
which sanitary science strongly tends to go. Tuberculosis ia now known to be a
strictly contagious disease, and tho most malignant one known, to man, if judged
either by the number of its victims or the percentage of deaths to oases.
Springfield Republican.
The growing sensitivenesss of California to being known as a home of con
sumptives is manifested in a resolution adopted by tnu State Board of Health
suggesting a quarantine against all "human beings and domestic animals with
tuberculosis entering the State." It Is claimed that 20,0w patients go to Califor
nia yearly from other sections and spread contagion broadcast in that State. The
contagiousness of tuberculosis is now so well established that incidents of this
kind, while they seem harsh, are to be expected. Some time there may be special
hospitals for consumptives in every State, and as much pains taken to prevent
the epread of the disease as smallpox or diphtheria.
Boston Herald.
California will be likely to lost much of her popularity as a resort for con
sumptives if the action of the State Board of Health there, calling for the estab
lishment of a quarantine against all persons afflicted with tuberculosis and the
strict isolation of all victims of the disease, is rigidly carried out. Still, it looks
like the part of prudence on the part of California If It values the welfare or Its
own citizens above that of the world at large.
Chicago News.
California should go slow In barring consumptives from "the land of sun
shine." Quite a respectable percentage of its population went to California for the
:t of its air and sunshine and it would come with bad grace from these to deny
others a similar right. Besides, if California puts up the bars against the rest
of the States In this respect it may occur to the latter to treat it to a dose of its
own medicine in financial and commercial ways, to which the inhabitants of the
"Golden State" would vigorously object.
Chicago IXemocrat.
Consumption Is not such a dangerously contagious disease as to demand quar
antine. That precautions should be taken to prevent contagion is certainly just,
but that California has a right to establish a "corner" on light and air in this
case may be seriously questioned. Indeed, doctors disagree on this subject as
well as on the value of the climate cure.
Philadelphia Evening Telegraph.
The action of the California State Board of Health looking towrard the quar
antining of that State against consumptives is likely to cause much comment and
111 ' test. But the public should not be too quickly alarmed. The California State
Board has by no means established such a quarantine; it has only resolved
that the board "consider the propriety" of such action. The movement is clearly
tentative and meant to open up the question and encourage debate. The
chances all are that California will not commit herself to a policy in which she
would be certain to be condemned by the world at large.
Philadelphia Call.
If California leads the way. other States will follow, and if so a serious harm
would be done to many afflicted people, who should have universal sympathy in
their efforts to regain health.
But, on the other hand, if consumption is an Infectious disease, carrying
danger to the community wherever it goes, there is no reason why the precau
tions found necessary to prevent the spread of other infectious diseases should
not be applied to it with equal rigor.
But it is to be hoped that safe and ample quarantine measures may be de
vised without barring from the land of the Golden Gate those who look" to it as
the land of hope.
Boston Journal.
The establishment of this proposed quarantine would be a heavy blow to those
who have found relief every winter in the sunny districts south of San Francisco;
yet California assuredly could not be condemned for adopting measures to insure
the sciiunl ht-alth of her own citizens. However, the question still remains, if other
semi-tropical States should take similar steps what would become of many vic
tims of this worst of diseases?
Washington Post.
California has acquired a notoriety that is not distinctly creditable or ad
vantageous for freak legislation. It is now seriously proposed, and not by
cranks and irresponsible*;, but by so important a body as the State Board of
Health, to bar consumptives out of the State. We have seen casual allusions
in newspapers indicating that the people of California and Colorado were dia
pleased with the practice of Eastern invalids going to thuse States, but this ac
tion of the California Board of Health is a long step in advance of occasional
newspaper complaint. It comes very near being an official notice to consump
tives, or those who appear to- be tending toward consumption, that the time
may soon arrive when they will not be permitted to enter that State. Hereto
fore these unfortunates have been invited by circulars and newspaper adver
tisements, issued by owners of health resorts, to c-ome and breathe the healing
air of California. Is that healing to be denied them?
St. Joseph (Mo.) Herald.
The people of California are fearful that they will contract the deadly dis
ease of consumption from the large number of cases constantly in their midst.
How such a law could.be executed is one of the hardest problems to be con
sideredâharder, in fact, than the solution of the question, whether it would do
any good. AVith all its difficulties, it is not at all likely that such a law will
be enacted or enforced.
Philadelphia Inquirer.
Few people could have supposed that the suggestion lately made by a Call
fornian doctor that the State establish a quarantine against consumptives would
be carried into effect and for that reason the representations now being made
by members of the profession with regard to the impracticability of accom
plishing what was proposed will attract only an academic interest. It is, how
ever, gratifying to find that the profession generally is inclined to feel Indignant
at the Idea of attempting or even thinking about a procedure at once so self
ish and so inhuman. That is a sentiment with which the great majority of
people will heartily sympathise. Must of us have not yet schooled ourselves
to regard disease from the purely scientific point of view, as something to be
stamped out without any consideration for the feelings or the welfare of those
who suffer from it.
Salt Lake Deseret News.
It is easily understood that California does not enjoy the reputation as a
health rosort, which brings thousands of consumptives to her cities and towns
and villages to inhale the balmy atmosphere, particularly In \ - iew of the danger
of infection they carry with them. But if one class of sufferers is to be ex
cfuded from any particular spot in this free country, why not all? How many
diseases are there that are not "catching?"
The modern tendency is to establish special institutes where people suffer
ing from pulmonary troubles may be treated, but no civilized State has as yet
established quarantine against the unfortunates of that class. It is not proba
ble it can be maintained in California.
SHOULD BE MADE
TO PAY THE WAR TAX
Opinipn of the Interior Press on the Way
Wells, Fargo & Co. Is Evading
the Law.
Windsor Herald.
Several Judges have decided lately that Wells, Fargo & Co. are liable fr>r the
revenue war tax stamp required on their orders, receipts and packages received
by them for transmission, and yet they refuse to pay it and still persist in
niaking the people pay the tax for them by refusing to accept packages for
transmission or to do any business with the people at all until after the people
have paid for the war tax stamp which the law requires the express company
should pay for. This is as unpatriotic as it is dishonest and unjust on the part
of Wells, Fargo & Co., and they should either be made respect the law and pay
their just share of the war tax or surrender their franchise to do business in
a country whose laws they do not respect and under the protection of a Gov
ernment to which they are neither loyal, honest nor profitable.
liivennore Herald.
It would appear that Wells, Fargo & Co. will at last be compelled to pay their
proportion of the war tax. In the Superior Court at San Francisco last week
Judge Troutt gave judgment against the company in a suit brought in the name
of the people of the State to determine whether or not the company should pay
for the revenue stamps required by law to be affixed to its bills of landing or
other receipts for goods to be transported over its lines. While the decision must
now stand th--> test of the Supreme Court, there seems to be no doubt but that it
will be sustained. The telegraph companies should then receive the sairie atten
tion, and a great victory for the people will have been achieved.
Chino Valley Champion;
Wells, Fargo & Co. are getting a thoroughly good and well deserved roasting
from all over California on account of their refusal to pay the war revenue on
the business they do and their shifting this burden, which rightfully belongs to
them, upon the people who do business with them. On top of this Superior Judge
Troutt of San Francisco has rendered a decision holding that the company must
pay its tax. For these joint and several reasons J. J. Valentine, president of
the sneaking corporation, has been flooding the country with anti-expansion and
anti-war circulars. Valentine and hia precious company deserve their roasting.
They should have some more of it. And then they should be severely let alone

Superior Judge Troutt of San Francisco has decided that "Wells, Fargo & Co.
must pay the revenue stamp that must be affixed to a package. It is pleasant
to learn that the company has to pay it, but it is not an occasion for hilarity, as
the public will pay it finally by reason of increased rate.
â¢ â¢ Â»
Berkeley World Gazette.
The words of Congressman Marion de Aries on the question of whether the
telegraph and express companies should pay their war taxes strike the key
note of the situation. He f:ivs: "In my opinion it was the intention of Congress
that express and telegraph companies should pay the war tax attempted to be
levied upon them in the revenue act." This is true. Congress aimed the tax
at these corporations and did not Intend that the people should pay them No
more unpatriotic attitude has ever been shown against the United States than
has been shown by these rich companies. No better law could be passed by
Congress than one compelling these corporations to pay this tax and urohihirint
the shifting of it to the patrons; or else cancel their corporate privilege. Â«m

â¢ wasted in preliminary skirmishes. The
proceedings were mated from start to
â¢ finish and decidedly spicy when the con
test- came on between Colonel Victor D.
Duboce and YV. A. Deane for County
.'Clerk. An effort to stampede the dele
gates to Colonel Duboce seemed for a few
â¢ minutes to be on the point of success,
but Deane's friends rallied their reserves
and opened a counter attack on Duboce,
asserting with emphasis that he was so
unpopular in the First California Regl
' merit that ne could not get as many votes
in that organization as Deane could mus
;. ter. Sharp reply was made to the fire on
.â¢Duboce. Delegates assorted that Colonel
' Smith was the unpopular officer or that
organization, and that Duboce possessed
the confidence of the volunteers. Refer
ence was made to the glorious welcome
â  given to the brave soldiers on their return
from the war. and delegates were asked
â¢ to declare whether they were sincere in
the' display of according honors to gallant
soldiers. They were requested to show
how much meaning there was in the pro

were asked to prove their sincerity by
supporting < 'olon< 1 Duboce.
Delegate Wallace Bradford, who shouted
1 for Colonel Duboce's nomination by ac
clamation, aroused much enthUFianm.

â  touching Deane legations on a raw spot.
He- taunted the delegates who were sup
porting Deane with an insinuation that
.they- were cringing under the crack of a
â¢ lash and- did not have the manliness to
"voice their own sentiments. He insinu
ated, that the County Clerk's .office was a

sented by Delegate Jones of the Thirty
seventh District, who remarked that it
would not be â¢â  -â â¢ to nominate a man who
was most disliked when best known.
Deane won out by a small margin, but

The name of Charles H. Bliss, a popular
and progressive merchant, was added to
the list of candidates for Supervisor.
Immediately upon the caucus reconven
ing last night the secretary was in
structed to call the roll. Few absentees
â¢were noted,, probably due 10 the fact tnat
".a number at nominations were to be dls
â¢posed among the various candidates.
Charles L. Fi-Â»ld and Andrew McElroy
had their names removed from the list of
possible candidates for Supervisors. Mr.

resigned from Ihi Committee on Super

! sider the qualifications of the candidates
for Police Judgts and that it report at
the next meeting of the caucus. Max
Goldberg thought the motion was In
definite. He Inquired whether the com
mittee -was to report tho number to be
nominated or as to their qualifications.
Judgi Schell thought the question was
answered in th. original motion, but for
i th,> benefit of Us Interrogator he stated
that the committee was tor iln> purpose
; of reporting back on the qualilicatlons of
j the candid
l elegate Goldberg replied that while he
was satisfied with a committee on Su
pervisors, he was not satisfied with a
committee on Police Judges. He said
that every one within t ho sound of his
â  voice was capable of choosing the men
to represent the party at the coming
election. He thought the names should
be placed before the caucus and let it
â â â  presentatlves.
egate Sargent offered as an amnd
ment thut the names of the candidates be
stated in open convention and the com
mittee could then decide on their fitness.
In answering Delegate Goldberg he said
â  who were not attorneys do not
know the qualities of these men. It
would be like calling upon a layman to
report on a steam engine. Judge Schell
pted the amendment and made it a
part of his original moti. n. but before
uld be put to the d< legates, stated
that be <'A<l not mak< the motion with
a view to reducing the number of can
didates who would undoubtedly be pre
sented to the caucus, but it was to de
cide on their fitness, il-- said he knew
of three candidates who are disqualified
â  under the chartt r by reason of non-resl
dem â¢â  and not being admitted to practice
In the Supreme Court. He thought it
was proper for the committee to Investi
gate the candidates to Bee it' they were
legally qualified. A delegate from the
Thirty-sixth District interrupted the
speaker to suggest that the members of
1 the committee be appointed from â  ach
district, as was done in the matter' of
the Supervisors. Judge Schell acquiesced
In this and the motion was put by the
rman and carried.
Chairman Kellogg then announced the
next order of business to be the nomina
tion of an Assessor. Delegate King
marched up ;o the platform and depos
ited his JlO and then delivered a eulogy
on his candidate. He said the office
;'n Important one and that on the nom
ination made by the caucus would rest
the success .-f the Hike!, at the coming
election. He therefore placed Albert
! Heyer in nomination tor the office. Ho
told of his many victories In the past;
dwelt on his honesty and faithfulness to
the pledges ne took while in office. tie |
said good men jÂ±re needed and good men
have been chosen to represent the party
| on th 3 ticket, but he thought the dele
| gates should look "Heyer. This pun
en ated laughter.
]<r- was followed by L. L. Solomons,
' who promised not to make a pun on his
' candidate's name, but at the close <jf his
eulogistic speech on him said h>- would
have to ask the members of the callous to
look very low for a good manâ down In
the "Myf-r." Without waiting for tho risi
bles to subside he mentioned M. D. layer
as a fittinK selection for the office, a
vote being taken. Heyer received ISO and
Myer ID. Mr. Solomons irinvH that the
nation of Mr. Heyer be made unani
mous, which wus prompth agreed to by
the caucus.
Nominations for Tax Collector were
next In order, and P. B. Haynes of the
Thirty-seventh District said it wus his
happy privilege to place in nomination J.
H. Scott, a gentleman who was in every
way qualified to hold that important of
fice. He said Mr. Scott had never filled
B political office; !ie was not of that class !
of citizens who is always chasing the elu- j
Blve official dollar. He sal<l his candidate !
was in this city thirty-seven years atfo
and had grown up with the municipality,
Mid is to-day one of the leading business
men of the city and president of tho
I Scott-Curtas Piano Company. The speak
er :'ssurf'(i his auditors that Mr. Scott
hart the ability and the means to fill that
office with honor, and If h<Â» wa* given the
nomination he would roll up r tremendous
majority. The nomination was seconded
by iJeleÃnte King In a few fitting sen
tences.
Again Delegate Solomons stepped for
v.anl, and with a smile beaming on his I
countenance said: "(Jentlemen, i am al- i
most out of money by this time, but I rise..
' I'l'.i nlx-llke, from the ruins of my recent
defeat with a nomination, this time, how
ever, with a winner." He said he had a
I man In the Fortieth District just fitted
: for the office of Tax Collector, and his
i name was J. Harry Baehr. He said no
adverse criticism could be made against
1 him, as he had lived in the community
j with honor to himself; that he was a <Jip
i uty in the County Recorder's office, that
' he was possessed of energy, atid, what
was oven more in his favor, was extreme
ily populaj. Chairman Kellogg announced
' ;&* vfie to be as follows: Scott 129,
THE SAINT FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1899.
Baehr 57. Mr. Haynes. who nominated
Scott, in his joy at winning, moved to
make it unanimous, but wiser heads pre
vailed on him to withdraw his motion. Tho
opposition then gracefully conceded Its
o.t, a t D y making Mr. Scott's election
unanimous.
Nominations for Recorder followed, and
I. eon K. Prescott of the Fortieth Distrii I
opened the ball. He said he was sure his
district would be successful this time, as
he was going to name a gentleman who
for over thirty years had enjoyed the,
respect of the community in which he has
resided. By nominating him the caucus
would add force and effect to the ticket,
as his candidate would surely poll a high
vote. Ho said the name of W. /.. Tiffany
would raise the vote above any other can
didate on the ticket. He said Mr. Tiffany
was related to Mr. Merrill of the tlrm of
Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson; was a mem
ber of many fraternal organisations and
enjoyed a wide acquaintance.
Andrew Oleson of the Thirty-sixth
District followed by nominating Frank
French, who. he said, was the choice of
his delegation. He spoke of his great
services to the Republican party and of
his high standing in the community.
Delegate Wai Del of the same district re
inforced Mr. Oleson' a encomiums by stat
ing that the Mission district, which had
over IS.OO'i voters, had not one candidate
on the ticket so far, and in behalf of that
section he asked that Mr. French's claims
to the nomination be taken into consid
eration. He said there was not a man
within the hearing of his voice who had
done more for the party than Mr. French.
He said a man like the latter could carry
more votes than any one already men
tioned: that he had been In this city over
thirty-two years, and in that time had
won a name for honesty and integrity.
Delegate Goldberg followed and said be
arose for the purpose of seconding the
nomination of Mr. Tiffany. In part he
said: "1 do not know whether I could

said by the gentleman who placed him
In nomination, except that Mr. Tiffany

three years ago. He is a member of the
board of directors in the Pioneers; a son
of Old 'Bob' Tiffany, and if there nre

though he has been solicited. You can
not put a man on your ticket who will

!s a taxpayer, stock owner In the Clay
Street Hank; he is a citizen of Han Fran
cisco and an honor to it. If you select
him for this important office, and it is
an important office, the linger of scorn
shall never point to the honor of Mr.
Tiffany. He is as honest and upright as
the very sun that shines from the skies.
We are here to nominate good men and
men who will win."
Mr. Bradbury arose to second the nomi
nation of Mr. Tiffany, and said that in
conversation that afternoon with Mr.
Dohrmann, the latter had told him that
if good men were nominated <>n the
ticket the Republican party would be smo
cei sful at the polls, lie therefore in the
interest of good government earnestly ad
vi cated Mr. Tiffany.
J. B. Barber arose, and in a loud voice
stated that Mr. French was not born In
this City but In the glorious State of
Maine, and that he was not running for
office under bis "granfather's hftt";
that that day was past. He also spoke In
favor of Mr. French for the office. J. B.
Bird closed the spccchmaklng by speaking
in favor of Mr. Tiffany.
In announcing the vote Chairman Kel
logg said it was the closest of the caucus;
that Tiffany received 100 and French S6.
Mr. Humphreys moved to make the elec
tion o) Mr. Tiffany unanimous, and the
motion was carried.
No name being received for the office
of City and County Attorney, a recess of
ten minutes was taken, and on the recon
vening of the caucus that office was
passed for the time being. The next office
to receive the attention of the delegates
was that of District Attorney. H. C.
Schaertzer of the Forty-second District
took the floor and placed Alfred P. Black
In nomination. He spoke highly of Mr.
Black's fitness folr the office, stating that
he was not connected with the Incumbent
In the position of Assistant District Attor
ney, that Mr. Black had not decided to
allow Ills name to go before th% caucus
until yesterday morning; thut although
he did not seek the office, if he
were honored with the nomination he
would indorse the platform. The speaker
concluded by saying the nomination
should be given to Mr. Bla^k by accla
mation. No other nomination being re
ceived, the reouest of Delegate Schaertzer
was followed out.
Nominations for the office of Public Ad
ministrator were next in order. W. H. R.
McMartin paid his $10 and named the in
cumbent, John A. Drinkhouse, for the of
lice. He spoke of his splendid record In
that position, and thought he should again
be honored. Delegate Harron cnught tho
chairman's eye, and after handing ten in
gold to the secretary with a flourish, ere
ated some laughter by nominating a doc
tor for the office of Coroner. The noise
having subsided. J. K. C. ITobbs took the
i floor and placed John Farnham in nom
ination. He dwelt on the record of Cap
tain Farnham as. a business man. He said
he always paid 100 cents on the dollar, and
had been a resident of this city for over
thirty-six years. He was -followed by At
torney Edmund Tausky who said he
arose for the purpose of placing W. S.
i L.yle. in nomination. He extolled his can
i didate and gave way to Judge Sehell. who
seconded the nomination of Mr. Farn
ham. Delegate Smith followed by placing
Supervisor Perrault in nomination. He
told of the grent services rendered by Dr.
Perrault to the city, and trusted they
would be appreciated by the caucus by
choosing him to represent the. party on
the ticket at the coming election.
Delegate King inquired of Mr. Smith
i whether Dr. Perrault had been here five
j years, and the latter replied that that
! question had been anticipated and he had
taken pains to learn that the doctor was
'-. a native son and had practiced his pro
fession here for many years, and had
i gone to a northern city to continue it
j and had returned and resided here four
years and eight months, and was fully
' qualified to accept the office if he were
j elected to it.
Delegate Clark moved that the lowest
I candidate after the third ballot be
! dropped, and this course was decided on.

Farnham was elected on the first ballot.
having received 96, Lyle sr>. Prlnkhouse
'26 and Perrault 5. At the request of Mr.
Tausky,. Captain Farnham's selection wns
made unanimous.
Chairman Fields of the Committee on
Supervisors took the opportunity to re
port progress. He asked that more names
be added to the list. lie said the com
mittee had a delicate task and if It was
to give the citizens a chance to vet" tor
a strong ticket, the names of first class
men from all walks of life must re hnnde.l
in. He honed that the names of men
would be offered who would accept the
nomination if they were chosen.
Then followed the fight of the evening.
Chairman Kellogg announced that the
next order of business was the nomination
of a County Clerk. Delegate Harron then
stepped forward and in a ncut speech
named William A. Deune for the nomina
tion. He told of his good work during his
term i:i that office and declare! 1 that h<
would again puil us high a vote as he did
ut the last election If he were pluoed on
the ticket. Delegate Goldberg seconded
the nomination. Then came the surprise
of the night. Oliver Oleson. in ringing
tones, placed in nomination Victor D. Dv-
DOOe, late colonel of the California regi
ment. Hie name was greeted with load
applause by the admirers of the colonel.
After each eulogistic period "Wallace
Bradford would lead the cnet:iing. but the
friends of Dc-ane were not discouraged.
A. C. Rulofson of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict seconded the nomination of ( olooel
Duboce, an>! stittrd that it was his in
tention tO have placed his friend In nomi
nation for the office of Public Adminis
trator, but the frliiids of Captain Karn
ham were so Strong that he withdrew his
name. He admitted that he placed the
colonel in nomination for the office of
County Clerk without his knowledge, but
he called on the delegates to choose him
for the gallant services he had rendered
his country In the Philippines. He pro
phesied that if placed on the ticket Mr.
Duboce would be elected. Percy Long
seconded Deane by saying that one good
term deserved another, and he thought
the good work done by Deane while in
office phonic! be recognized with a place
on the ticket. Delegate McMartin, see
ing a chance, to do Deane a .good turn,
arose and said that Colonel Duboce was
unpopular in the California Regiment and
he did not believe he would make a show
ing. Delegate Jones voiced an emphatic
approval of McMartln'e opinion, and fur
ther added that if Colonel Duboce could
not carry his own regiment he could not
be expected to carry the city. Another
delegate arose and replied that Colonel
Smitn was the man wno was unpopular
with the soldiers of his command.
He said that when Colonel Smith re
ceived his promotion he sent a lot of beer
to the men and all but one company re
turned it to him unopened. He said he
had not heard any word of complaint
against Colonel Duboce. Edmund Tausky
seconded the nomination of Deane, as did
also Judge Scholl.
Wallace Bradford then made a sensa
tional speech in which he said that a lash
was hanging over the heads of the dele
gates and he appealed to them to disre
gard it and vote for Colonel Duboce.
Further debate was cut off and a vote
taken. Of the 178 votes cast, Williair '
Deane received 93 and Colonel Duboce 85.
When Deane was announced the winner a
great shout was heard in the ante-room,
where his friends awaited tiie result of '
the vote. A great deal of warm foeling
was engendered by the outcome of the
contest.
Percy Long was the first to catch the
speaker's eye when nominations for Sher
iff were In order. He placed Ed L Head
In nomination. He told of his good work
as School Director and of his high stand-
Ing in the city. J. G. Boyne followed by
nominating "Honest" John Lackmann,
and the shout that greeted his glowing
peroration only foretold his being chosen
for a place on the ticket. Delegate Maer
said It gave him a grent deal of pleasure
to second Mr. Lackmann's nomination.
J. K. C. Hobbs voiced his approval of Mr.
Lackmann's candidacy. On a vote being
taken Mr. Lackmann received 141 votes

J. C. Campbell opened the argument,

\ who desire to hold the full tenure of their

the election of officers under the charter.
: He claimed that the charter in respect to
county officers was subject to and con

Si>ecial DisDatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29.â A subject of
great import to the people of Southern
California, the exclusion of consumptives
and the quarantining of tuberculosis pa

there were present Dr. D. D. Crowley of
Oakland, Dr. Louis Bazet of San Fran
cisco. Dr. C. W. Ruggles of Stockton, Dr.

Neither the State board nor the city

Btroyer of mankind, and it Is not expected
that formal action will be taken. The
State board has adopted a resolution
agreeing to a thorough investigation of
the subject.
A majority of the members of the board
are strongly in favor of the adoption of
methods looking to the abatement of the
disease. Dr. J. H. Davisson, a member
of the city board, advocated the protec
tion of the California public from the rav
ages of imported tuberculosis while pres
ident of the board. The population of
beautiful, healthful California, where the
climate, especially in the Southern part,
would render native tuberculosis a rare
and uncommon affliction of mankind,
should not longer, the doctors say, be ex
posed to the contagion of a disease
brought by the unfortunates of other
States.
It was decided to adopt measures to ef
fectively quarantine against smallpox.
The board has recommended the placing
of inspectors at Needles and Yuma. The
jurisdiction of these inspectors shall not
be In narrow limits, but the entire border
of Arizona and Mexico will be patrolled,
so that a repetition of the recent invasion
of the disease may be prevented.

hanging by the neck to the bedpost met
his eyes. Around her neck was a sheet,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 1899.
POLISHING
UNDERBODY
OF YACHTS
Crews of Both Craft Busily
Getting Them Into
Racing Trim.
Special DlÃratch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 29.â This has been a
particularly busy dny for the crews of
i both the American cup defender, the Co
| lumbla, and the challenger, the Shamrock.
From early morning a larere portion of
the men on the Columbia were busy scrap
-1 iriÂ£ and polishing her metal underbody.
i The electric burnishers were discarded
j after several trials, for the men found
that they could do the work faster and
; better by hand.
The Shamrock's underbody is practically
1 finished BO far as polishing is concerned.
The fact that the challenger's hull is mote
advanced than on the Columbia is due
to the division of the crew Into two
watches, one working all night and the
other working all day. When the Sham
rock was first exposed to view every one
was of the opinion that her lead keel
was not covered with me-tal. similar to
the Columbia's, but when the undeibody
was polished off it was seen that the lead
was protected by sheet copper, over which
a coating of red anti-corrosive paint had
been put. To-day the copper was polished
up well and the very bottom sheets were
given a coat of dark red paint. The work
of polishing up the Columbia's hull will
take at ]Â»-a.st another day. as at 5 o'clock
this afternoon, when the men quit work
there was still considerable surface about
the bilges that hm] not bo^n touched. The
Columbia, therefore, will not be tloated
out of the (look until Monday morning.
The new bobstay for the Columbia Ar
rived from the Herreshoffs' works last
night and to-day Rigger Blllman and his
men went to work putting it in place.
The new piece of wire rope is about one
and one-quarter Inches In diameter, slight
ly larger than the one which broke last
wotk and as It had been given a two
humlred-ton test Ijeff.re it was sent here
from Bristol it should carry, the boat
through the races. When the bobstay had
been secured at each end the slax?k was
taken up by turning the bowsprit out
board. There is still a chance to work
the bowsprit out six or seven inches, and
when the wire stay stretches more tiie
slack will be taken up.
The port side of the Columbia was given
a coat of fresh white paint and the star
board side will be repainted to-morrow.
The top sides of the Shamrock were
painted a delicate shade of green also
to-day so that both craft will go into the
races as they were originally painted not
withstanding the theory that there was
a loss of speed by so doing. Among the
most Interested of the spectators thai saw
the Columbia to-d:iy were Cnptains Archie
Hogarth and Wring* and Sailnutker Rat
sey of the Shamrock. These gentlemen
were piloted to the navy yard by Painter
Mitchell, who had been superintending the
painting of the Irish yacht, and Mate
Allen of the American boat met them Just
outside the yard.
At the drydock the party found Captain
Barr and Measurer John ITyslop and for
an hour the rival captains talked over the
relative merits of the two boats and
viewed the Columbia's hull at close quar
ters. The Englishmen did not care to
pxpreps any opinion other than to say that
the Columbia was a fine looking craft.
Besides repainting the topsides and
scouring the hull of the Shamrock there
was considerable other work done about
the boat. Most important of all was the
putting on of a new bobstay. Designer
Fife evidently*" Â«lid not care tn run the
risk of carrying th.-i* important piece of
rigging away during a race and Instead
if having the new stsÂ»r a single wire rope
It was made doub!.- and was woun-1 for
more than half its length with maiiin to
prevent chafing. There was some talk
about the Erie basin that the Shamrock
would be floated out of the dook to-mor
row afternoon and as the craft Is about
ready there may be some truth in the
rumor, but John M. Hyslop, official meas
urer of the New York Yacht Club, said
this afternoon that he would put the tape
to the two boats next Monday. He will
first measure the Columbia at the navy
yard before she leaves the drydock and
:hen will board the Shamrock's'tug, Law
rence, and go around to the Erie basin
to measure the Irish cutter.
Put trp a Poor Mill.
CHICAGO, Sept. 29.-The fight between]
"Mysterious" Billy Smith and Billy Stift
of Chicago was declared a draw after six
rounds of very poor work by both men.
Neither was disposed to do any lighting,
and thevwere continually laughing during
the clinches. The crowd was vociferous in
its disapproval and continually yelled
"fake." Stift landed three good blows
during the contest and Smith but one.

TOM KEARNS
IS DEFEATED
BY O'BRIEN
Latter Will Soon Be Matched
to Meet Frank
Erne.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â Jack O'Brien of
this city is now entitled to meet Frank
Erne for the lightweight championship,
as he knocked out Tom Kearns of Boston
at the New Broadway Athletic Club 10
--night. They met for a twenty-five-round
go at loS pounds, but Kearns received his
quietus in the thirteenth round, after hav
ing all the worst of the argument from
the beginning. In the final round Kearns
was so badly beaten that he dropped his
guard and O'Brien swung his right to the
mark. Kearns dropped helplessly, and it
was fully ten minutes before he regained
A match between Erne and O'Brien will
soon be arranged. To-night Tom O'Rourke
made a bet of $2.">00 at even on O'Brien,
and Erne's new manager, Bobby Smith,
took up the Kine end of the bet. Each
bettor posted $500 in the hands of "Honest
John" Kelly to bind the wager.
Newman's Nero Poisoned.
The do* poisoner has added another vic
tim to his list. This time it is Charles
Newman's great rough-coated St, Ber
nard Xero. The body of the canine was
fcund stiff and stark yesterday morning
in the yard in the rear of the Newman
residence, 710 McAllister street. The con
dition of the carcass showed undoubt
edly that poison had been used on the
dogr.
Nero was one nf a number of high class
il.^h owned by Mr. Newman. He was five
years old and cost $I(HHi. His owner
has suffered considerably from dog
Btealers and poisoners, and of late has
been keeping a watchful eye on his pets.
Within the past month Xero"s kennel
mate, I Jon. was stolen twice, but was re
covered each time. These attacks on his
dogs led Mr. Newman to turn Lion over
to his brother, and the fact that he was
not in the yard with NeYo Thursday night
was probably all that saved him from a
similar fate.

Didn't Know Old K!nÂ£ Coffee Had Her.

c\\\ them amonp a great many diflfer-
â¢ t pf'irle, and it is surprising to know j
ho v many are suffering from the use of \
te, which Is the. primary cause of j
the majority of many nervous dis- j
s. My own experience has been |
that I ff-el that I can speak with I
. knowledge of the subject.
"For about ten . years I was afflicted
with a sevpr*- nervotu disorder, which \
1 ,-iy bo ,'rcat that ploep became an un- j
kndwn t ling to me without the use of I
s. I was a confirmed coffee I
drinker fit this tim*Â», but had never j
that had anything to do with
th<- difficulty.
'-'After coming to Chicago to live I j
was to; i by an acquaintance, who had
been a similar suffeivr from nervous-
that he had discovered it was
cau.S' â  us 6 of coffee, and when
he made that discovery gave up the

I'l was. completely re-
gtored. li:.^ argument sounded fo logi-
cal 1 waa determined to make the ex-
periment, and, to my surprise, upon
leaving off the coffee habit I com- j
menced to Improve. This improvement !
has continued until now I am in com-
health and sie<-p well and natur-
ally. I always advise patients
Ing from aervoUE trouble to abandon
the use of coffee and use Postum. for I
know what I am talking about on that
gubjeet.
"Oc'cftaionally private families do
not prepare Postum well â that is, they
fail to allow a sufficient amount of time
for boiling. It requires more boiling
than coffee, hut the carp well repays,
tor the br-verago is delightful to the j
and wonderfully nourishing."

MRS. PEDAR BRL'GUIERE is the latest addition to Modjeska's forces. She
appeared last r.ipht in "Marie Antoinette" in a part heretofore played by
Miss Gardner.
As M:s- Madeline McKisick, daughter of .Tuci.ce McKisick, Mrs. Kruguiere
wnji all the honors oftVreil the amateur. She married young Bruguiere, son of
Emll Bruguiere, the capitalist. Mrs. Kruguiere Is better prepared to wrest his
trionic laurels than most society women. In addition to hr-r tine stage appearance,
she is an exquisite dancer, having been trained since childhood in the art. More
over, she has had the best instruction in dramatic expression, although never In
tended for the stage.
WHEN a young woman who has I
b^en prominent in soda] circles, a
belle, !n fact, Bees :'r to abandon
her triumphs ar.Â«l adopt a profes-
Bional career, one is acru?tÂ»mrd to a de- !
hut announced with a flourish of trump
ets, attended by the flower of her set and
made succ<-psful by determined applause,
deserved or by courtesyâ more often the
latter. And then? She lives along, giving
promise of great things in future; and the
future is such an indefinite distance. Per
haps the errors of her predecessors nave
been of profit to Mrs. Pedar Bruguiere,
for the simplicity and modesty of her first
appearance in Madame Modjeska's com
pany last night indicate that it is not no
toriety and admiration she s< eks. but
rather an opportunity to quietly prove her
right to a place in the profession of her
choice- In the- small part, of Louise

THAT WEARY ELEVATOR
THAT DOES NOT ELEVATE
CUSTOM-HOUSE NUISANCE THAT
EXCITES CUSS-WORDS.
The Officers and Public Pant Up the
Stairs While the Machine Sleeps
In Its Shaft.
Down in the Custom-house, in the an
cient Postofnce building, whose exterior
presents the appearance of 'an eczema in
cement, there is an elevator that does not ;
elevate. - . . . ' .
It was not always there. Prior to the I
administration of Judge. Huger as Col- |
lector the stone and iron stairs had borne 1
the wear and tear of generations of clerks j
and brokers. But the Judge looked upon |
those stairs and disliked them. Senator
"Wade of Ohio was a past master in pro
fanity. He was sent by Grant to investi
gate San Domingo, and his report was
so (luminous as to be Incompatible with
his opportunity to investigate. Then it
was said that Wade, of course, took only
a cursory view of the Island.
The law makes the Collector of Customs
the custodian of the Government build
ing. Those who heard Judge Hager on
his winding way upstairs every morning
came to call him the cuss-todian.
However, he prevailed on the Treasury
Department to sink a shaft through the
venerable pile and put therein a hydraulic
elevator. The same power ran it and the
judicial lift in the Appraiser's building
which carries Judges to the seat of judg
ment, clients to be plucked and lawyers
who pluck them, and criminals to their
doom.
The Custom-house elevator, barring oc
casional disabilities, ran steadily through
three administrations until eight months
ago, when it stopped short, whether to
ever go again no fellow can find out. It
was rt-ported that the boilers had given
out. and a contract was made, all tied up
with red tape, giving the contractors eight
months to put in a new one, when a busi
ness man would have had it done in eight
days.
All summer the officers and the public
have puffed and panted up the stairs,
while the elevator Bleeps in its shaft. The
contractor's time was up -the Ist of Sep
tember, and invitations were out for an
opening in the box, at which the Col
lector, Surveyor and Naval Officer were to
receive and entertain the lame and halt !
and celebrate the leturn of the prodigal
machine to its duty. But on that day
the box was gathering dust behind the
grilled door and the long procession of
clerks and brokers cussed and puffed its !
way upstairs. In the Appraiser's building j
it is as bad! Prisoners are thinking of
applying for a habeas corpus because that I
climb comes under the head of cruel and j
unusual punishment. Still the Govern- j
ment of the United States, which has just i
licked Spain and is reaching out for in
sular barbarians to elevate them, is in
capable of getting a go on one hydraulic
elevator. , ..-â â â¢ \^y
FESTY O'DONNELL INSANE.
Ordered Committed to Ukiah. Asylum
by Judge Troutt.
Peaty O'Donnell, whose gold was the
object of Attorney Benson's greed, was
adjudged Insane yesterday and sent to the
asylum at Uklah. During the morning A.
O. Colton made- application to be ap
pointed Fcsty's guardian, but the court
continued the application until October 2.
A short time later the aged incompetent
was taken before the Lunacy Commis
sion, Judge Troutt presiding. A few ques
tions, and but little testimony, convinced
the experts that Festy was Indeed Insane
and should be Immediately confined for
treatment. An order committing him to
the asylum was made and in charge of
a Deputy Sheriff h<* started on his Jour
ney to the madhouse.

LABOR TROUBLES
ALL SETTLED
â¦;
Success of Chicago's
Festival Sure,
CHICAGO. Sept. 29.â The labor troubles
which have hedged about the fall festival
and the cornerstone laying have been
settled. The Uuiluing Trades Council, at
a meeting to-night, after more than an
hour's debate, decided unanimously to ef
fect a settlement by furnishing, cutting
and laying the cornerstone of the Federal
building.
The report of the strike committee wao
to the effect that if the Building Trades"
Council could agree to furnish, cut and
set the cornerstone labor difficulties f<*r
the present could be easily settled.] Argu
ment on the question waa fierce, but at
last a motion to Accept the report of the
committee was carried unanimously. The
vote also carried with It the agreement
of the HuiUling Trades Council to further
by every mep.ns in its power the Buccesa
of the autumn demonstration and the cor
nerstone laying, while the members uf the
Federal committee promised to use their
individual efforts to secure from Contrac
tor Pierce an agreement that the remain
der of the Federal building wojild bo
erected by union labor.
The cornerstone is to be an Illinois pro
duct. The cost of the rough stone, freight,
cutting and setting of the s;'mr -.sill be
borne by the Building Trades Council.
This action "n the part of the Building
Trades Council settles the question of the
success of the cornerstone laying so far as
the labor end of the matter is concerned.
Not only is the Federal committee as
sured of a peaceable setting of the stone,
but th< work on arches, floats and decora
tions will be pushed rapidly.
Private advices from members of tnÂ»Â»
delegation now in New York are to the
effect that Admiral Dewey Is sure to acÂ«
company the President on his Western
trip, which includes the corni rstone lay
big, and desperate efforts will be made to
decorate the city properly in honor of the
distinguished visitor.
NATIVE OFFICIALS
FOR THE SAMOANS
New Regime Instituted by the Pro
visional Government and
Peace Prevails.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 2ft.â Late official
advices from Samoa contain accounts of
recent meetings of, the Provisional Gov
ernment at Apia at which stfÂ£is were
taken to have native Judges try cases be
tween natives, and native officials to sol
emnize marriages and keep the tax rec
ords of property owned by the Bamoans,
Two Judges, Tagoa and Toomata, were
chosen, one being an adherent of the for
mer King. Malletoa, and the other a Ma
taafan. The provisional authorities set
tled the claim of the heirs of the late
King: Maiietoa Laupepa and rejected the
claim of the Secretary of the late SamoaTJ
Government. Captain Preedy of the Brit
ish ship Torch was given several war
rants against natives for capital crimes,
winch will be turned over to Chief Lauati
for execution.
The proceedings indicate an entirely pa
cific condition of affairs on the island.

LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM.
[letter TO MRS. I'lxk::ali no. 67,104]
" I cannot express my gratitude to
you for the good that Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done
for me. I have taken five bottles of
j the Compound and two boxes of Liver
Pills and feel better in every respect.
I had suffered for years with dropsy;
the veins in my limbs burst, caused
from the pressure of the water. I had
l the worst kind of kidney trouble, faint-
ing spells, and I could not stand long
at a time.' I also had female weakness
and the doctor said there was a tumor
in my left side. The pains I had to
stand . were something dreadful. A
friend handed me a little book of yours,
so I got your medicine and it has saved
my life. . I felt better from the first
bottle. The bloating and the tumors
' have all gone and I do not suffer any
pain. lam still using the Vegetable
! Compound and hope others may find
relief as I have done from its use." â
Miss N. J. Lockhzart, Box 16, Eliza-

Only the women who have suffered
. with female troubles can fully appre-
ciate the gratitude of those who have
been restored to health. .*â¢

CHICAGO, Sept. 2?.â Early trading In wheat
was without feature. The markrt opened at
practically unehaasred !ijn'-"<-.- and for some
time kept within an extremely narrow range,
with what little trading there was doing con
fined principally to scalpers, A bullish senti
ment was shown by traders, and before 11
o'clock the market bad become fairly active.
No important advance occurred, however, un
til the New Orleans cotton market was put
into a state of excitement by bogus cables and
the -wilrlrwss of prices there was sympathized
in by wheat shorts, the deferred futures scor
ing a good advance on free covering-. The
critical state of affairs in the Transvaal had
some Influence, though there was some dis
appointment over the slight advance at Liver
pool. Light primary receipts also attracted a
goxl deal of attention, increasing the belief
that "winter wheat supplies were low. An
active demand was reported for flour from both
the â '.;.â¢,'. Kingdom and the Continent. The
market was strong and active until late in
the session. Shortly before the close the mar
ket became weak and price? declined rapidly.
An Increase in the stocks at Minneapolis and
Dututh, Indicating a good increase In the visi
ble next week, was a factor toward the end,
and wbea it became known that the New
Orlean-s cotton advance was bogus general
quiet results, September was not heard
much of until nftar th* close, when from a
premium of 1 cent it dropped to a cent in
the discount on free offer 1 by long in
terests. December opened unchanged at 73\c.
It advance! to 74 3 5,0 during the excitement over
cotton and declined to 73' i(S r 73 l Â«.c, closing at
that price* September sold as high as 74 7 .. ,
t.n.l declined to 72 ; ,...'7-V\ where it closed.
Corn was nervous and Irregular, that mar-
Icet tike wheat, being affected by the New
Orleans cotton excitement. Shorts were heavy
bidders for September early in the session,
and prices advanced sharply. Late futures
followed the advance to a â¢ certain extent,
though inclined to drag a little on the pros
pert if an parly marketing of the new crop.
When the real cause of the New ' Orleans ad
vance became known there was a general let
ting go. and prices dropped rapidly, the mar
ket becoming h*>avy toward the close. The
cash demand was reimrted good. December
closed He lower at 30c, September He. lower at
32% c
"Oats in a perteral way followed other cerf-ala
Trading was Influenced somewhat by the cot
ton Jump, September advancing %c early on
free covering by shorts and deferred futures
also acting strong. Everything turned weak
late in the session, early buyers Belling freely
and the markei closed easy at Irregular de
clines. December closed a shade lowt-r at 22% c,
September ',â¢ lower at 22V;c.
Provisions were rather dull and irregular.

Harrison's cicular says: "During the week
there have been six deliveries of coal from
Washington, 18.180 tons; two from Oregon, 691 ;
tone; three from British Columbia, 11,198 tons;
live from Great Britain, 15.793 tons; one from
Philadelphia, WOO tons; one from Australia,
2736 tons; total, 50,261 tons. The above large arri
vals have come to hand most opportunely, and
proved to be just the character of coals most
needed, as Welsh Anthracite whs sadly wanted j
and the yards wen bare of Wellington; one j
cargo of Cardiff was Imported directly by the I
Navy Department to fill special requirements; |
: they have two others to follow. We cannot look j
for a repetition of foreign arrivals for
months to come, as most of the overdue ships |
are now here at anchor. The cargo of the !
new oullier T'Miua, due here to-morrow, was
loaded at Oyster Harbor, B. C. The agents
here say the coal will prove to be a duplicate
â¢of the old Wellington coal. If so, it will find
| very ready sale.. Freignt rates from Australia
: and England remain high, thus protecting our
coast collerles in (sustaining high values for at
j least six months to come.
"If the Honolulu demand would ease off a
i little, we might draw more liberally from Aus
i tralia for local demand; the writer thinks the
1 big rush to secure coal vessels for the Ha
; waiian trade must subside shortly. .Jobbers
trade In the city Is reported brisk, at fair
prices, with a crowing demand."

Eggs are drarer again. Butter and Cheese
stand the same.
MeatÃ are quoted as before, and there are no
signs that they will become any cheacer at
present. Poultry also stands about the same
as usual. The Game season will open on the
Ist.
The summer fruits are growing scarcer and
moÂ«t of them will disappear during the next
two or three weeks. Peaches are already going
out and Plums are scarcer. Supplies of Ber
ries, too, are steadily diminishing.
Summer Vegetables are not as plentiful, with
the exception of Tomatoes, which have been in
enormous supply and very cheap for several
weeks.

ELECTRICAL ENTERPRISES.
Large Schemes to Develop the Rich
Resources of the Interior of
This State.
Large electrical enterprises are about
to come into existence in this State. Many
smaller ones ore engaging the attention
of capitalists. One prominent electrical
supply house in this city is authority for
the information that not one day passes
in which an electrical motor is not sold
for use in the Interior. Many of these are
of *mnll power, for the use of private
irrigators, who luid it feasible to supplant
other apparatus with pumps worked by
electricity. Power plants of 3000 horse
power are engaging the attention of oth
ers principally large corporations. The
[tie;, gold mint's owners have about fin
ished putting in a plant, with a 3000 horse
power Westingbouse generator, to op
erate their stamp mill and compressors
and to furnish light to Angels Camp and
the surrounding country. Eventual. y they
will operate other mines near by with
this plant. The cost of the plant was
between (90,060 and JMrt.OVi. as estimated.
The Butte County Electrical Company,
of which Mr. Meysenberg, formerly pres
ident of the Siemens- Halske Company,
is the president, is concerned in large op
erations in Butte County. The company
has taken up a large water right and will
deliver the eleetrie current at Oroville and
CbiCO with --Ã¼b-stations, and also to
dredgers built for river gold mining. This
plant will cost not less than $70,000.
Another large scheme is to be located
on the Stanislaus River at Six Mile bar.
The work has already begun. The pro
jector is the Stanislaus Water Company,
in which Mrs. C. D. Lane, wife of the
Utlca mine millionaire, and C. D. Tulloeh,
who owns flouring mills at Oakdale, are
concerned. The purpose. Is to furnish pow
er to the grist mills at Oakdale and other
places ami also to the mines and mill of
the Royal Consolidate] Company at Hud
son' also to Lane's Alta mine, on the
WriKht grant, mar Copperopolis.
The Visalia plant has a 3000 horsepower
and gets power from streams on Mount
Whitney It has seventy miles of pole
lines and delivers power to Visalia, P.m
torville Tulare and Hanford. By the a:d
of this' plant the foothills are irrigated
and have been turned into a fine fruit
CO TheSectrlclans in this city see a bright
future for the State. They say that there
is water enough for irrigation if it is
oroperly cared for. and that it can oe
largely' used also for power without in
terlerirg with its use on the land.
The PortervlUe Light and Power Com
n-mv has purchased the plant of the Por-
U-rvill" Electric Light Works.
Contracts bayÂ« been made, according to
rpnorti by the San Bernardino Electric
Company with the Santa Fe railroad pro
viding for the operation of such.machin
ery belonging to the road at the San Ber
nardino shops as can be worked with elec
tricity.

FAVORABLE DAY
FOR LUCY RITE
Signatures on Hoiel
Register Identified.
Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARIPOSA, Sept. This was a red
letter day for Lucy Hite, the Indian wo
man who is trying to get a share of the
millions of John R. Hite. The hotel reg
ister was brought in evidence and proÂ»
duced something of a sensation. The in
scription, John R. Hite and wife, under
date of October 30, 1877, had not been
erased, as was supposed, but another por
tion of the book, containing Hite's indi
vidual signature, had been tampered with.
The case opened mildly this morning, i
eaÂ«n side taking turns and producing tes
timony for and against Lucy Hite'. Then ;
the plaintiff called Sherman" Reynolds to
the stand and asked him to identify the
register of the El Capitan Hotel of Mer
ced. Reynolds swore to finding both sig
natures in the book of the hotel at Mer
ced. He stated the signature "John R.
Hite and 'wife" was not as legible as when
he first saw it. He also said that he had
seen Hite's signature under date of Janu- i
ary 13, 187S, but that this line is now blank
j on the register.
. Thomas Glbbs was the next witness mi
i troduced for the purpose of identifying
the signature of John Hite. The inscrip- ;
tion was so dim witness said he was only
sure that the word Hite was in the de
fendant's handwriting; the balance he
could not see plainly.
Sherman Reynolds was again put on
I the stand by Foote and put through a
drilling that must have made him long
for the floor to open and swallow him up. i
Foote forced him to admit that he had
lied against Judge Paterson, whose side
he was supposed to be employed on; had
deceived him systematically, and that he
, had accepted $10 and expense money from
; the plaintiff.
Richard Finn took the stand and swore
\ that by general report Lucy and John R.
Hite were man and wife. He was unable,
however, to name any particular person
; who had heard her called Mrs. Hite.
! The old man's testimony was riot con
sidered of any importance. The testimony
i of a few minor witnesses closed the day's
I proceedings. The case will be resumed in
: San Francisco on October 5. Judge Jones
allowed $250 for the plaintiff on account
of the transfer of the case to San Fran
cisco. This was not to be considered as
alimony.
GENERAL EAGAN'S VISIT
TO WASHINGTON
Rumors Revived That the Commis- !
sary General Will Ask to Be Re
tired From the Army.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 88.â The presence
in Washington to-day of Brigadier Gen
eral Patrick ESgan lias given rise to a re
port that he is here in connection with !
his prospective retirement. Although the i
President and War Department would be.
much gratified to receive an application
from bun to go on the retired list, Secre
tary Root said to-day thai he <ii<l not |
make any such request when he called at'
the War Department to-day. It is known i
that mutual friends, upon the suggestion
of the President, have been trying to in- I
duce General Bagan to retire in order I
that the way may be opened for the pro- !
motion of Colonel Wea ton, who i.s now I
acting commissary general. The Presi
iient reels thai he made a great mistake
in mitigating General ESagan's sentence
from dismissal to suspension from duty
on full ray. Colonel Weston is really
suffering the penalty of the sentence, as
he is required to perform the duty of
commissary general on the pay of col
onel, while General Eagan is practically >
enjoying a leave of absence on full pay.
'l he President is powerless to direct his;
retirement without his consent, and up
to this time Genera] ESagan has refused
to listen to overtures which have been ;
made to mm.

Mrs. Ryerson's Trial.
SAN Dli:Â«;o. Sept. 29.â Mrs. Ryerson,
widow of tile late Governor Ryerson, who
was arrested several months ago at En
senada charged with hanging a boy to
a tree near her residence, has had her
preliminary trial, and the evidence has
been forwarded to the City of Mexico.
As a result of the examination, it is be
lieved that Mrs. Ryerson will soon regain
her liberty, as the only damaging testi
mony against her was the fact that sev
eral days prior to the boy's body being
found hanging to a tree she was seen
beating him. I'nder the Mexican laws,
â¢: â  evidence to secure a conviction must
leave no question of doubt as to the per
son's guilt.

TRUMP KILLED
BY AN OFFICER
Desperate Midnight Bat-
tle in Jail.
Pr*cial nispatch to The Call.
SANTA ANA. Sept. 29. -A tramp giving
the name of Herbert Glover died at the
County Jail this morning from wounds
inflicted on him by Officer Murray.
Officer Murray was summoned to Orange
at midnight by telephone to assist Deputy
Sheriff Bush to bring over two hard char
acters arrested earlier in the evening and
placed in a little old wooden jail. Upon
the arrival of the officer Bush and Murray
went to the jail, and as they opened the
door Glover and the other tramp, John
Leonard, drew guns on the officers and
began firing.
The first shot grazed Bush's forehead,
and be fell. Murray pulled a gun and
fired once through a crack in the door,
then slammed the door shut, holding it
against the combined force of both the
men. Both men in the jail continued
firing through the transom and a side
window at Murray, but their aim in the
total darkness was bad.
Bush recovered from the shock, jumped
to his feet and began discharging his re
volver into the jail door imagining the
tramps were breaking through. In all
nine shots were tired, when one of the
tramps cried enough. He was ordered to
pass out his gun. which he did, also the
gun of his companion, who was shot
through the abdomen. Both men were
landed In the County Jail shortly after
midnight.
Glover said that his home is in Spring
field, 111., and that his father's name is
G. C. Glover and that he has an uncle,
L. S. Glover, in San Diego. The other
man's name is Leonard, and his home is
in Flagstaff, Ariz. Both these men are
wanted for a burglary committed at San
Bernardino last week.
The Coroner's jury this afternoon exon
erated Officer Murray from all blame,
finding that he was fully justified in kill
ing Giover.

THE ART INSTITUTE
GEORGE CROCKER'S munificent gift to the Art Association, "The Escape
From Pompeii," was installed yesterday in the great gallery, and waJ
much admired by all who were fortunate enough to view the splendid
work of the master sculptor. There are three figures in the artistic
group, a man, a woman and a child, and the perfect modeling graphically tells
" the tale of the flight from the doomed city.
The figures are half life size and the proportions exceptionally fine. The
whole story breathes life.
The pedestal on which the figures rest stands three and a half feet high,
and the story of the destruction of Pompeii is carried out in the baa relief
I figures. The magnificent piece is modeled of the finest Parian marble,
- and is the work of the celebrated sculptor, G. M. Benzoni, of the Florence
' Academy, Italy.

completed its long list of witnesses and
will probably close its case on Saturday.

her husband. She testified as to having
written several letters to Cock while he
was employed at Walkers Landing under

taining employment for him In Napa and
1 that she had Been McKenzie regarding the
matter McKenzie informed her he would
secure a position for Cook later on. \\ n
ness warned McKenzie not to mention the
i affair to her husband. Witness admitted
that some time later she wrote the let
ter that brought Cook to Napa. She ad
mitted having <*een Cook with two pistols.
District Attorney Bell showed Mrs. \\ alt
ers the revolver which was found by the
body of Cook, but witness could not
j recognize it as Cook's property.

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATES.
Department of Justice Looks Into the ;
Killing of the Italians.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 29.â Attorney
General has dispatched a special agent of
the Department of Justice to Louisiana j
to make an official inquiry into the kill
iiiK of the five Italians at Talulah some
months ago. The last word from the Gov
ernor of the State indicate^ that he could
make no report on the subject : until, the
Grind Jury, which meets next January,
has looked into the killing, and the De
partment of Justice is therefore obliged
to act in order that the material may be
had for Congress at the approaching ses
sion. _
To the Commercial Congress.
At a meeting of the directors of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion yesterday Julian Sonntag was ap
pointed a deleg-ate to represent that body
at the National Commercial Congress,
which convenea In Philadelphia in Jhe
early part of the coming month. At that
gathering will be representatives from all
partp of the world, who are to discuss
matters relating to- trade and commerce
in general. Professor George Davidson
has consented to represent the local
Chamber of Commerce.
NO SCARCITY OF
INQUIRY IN THE
REALTY WORLD
Outlook Is Decidedly
Encouraging.
REAL estate brokers report but little
actual business during the past
week, but although sales have
been few, comparatively speaking,
there has been no lack of inquiry,
and the general tone of the market
Is decidedly encouraging. That the tem
porary lull Is not Indicative of a tendency
toward the lethargy that characterized
the summer months is evident to all who
are in the least familiar with existing
conditions, and the brokers themselves
were never more sanguine of a prosperous
winter season than they are at the pres
ent moment. This faith in the early en
hancement of rfalty values in San Fran
cisco has been forcibly illustrated during
the past few weeks by the numerous per
sonal Investments of the men whose busi
ness Jt is to buy and sell property for oth
ers, pocketing their commissions and tak
ing no chances on the fluctuations of the
market.
The only sale of any consequence during
the week was that of the residence prop
erty owned by James A. Donohoe Jr., on
Broadway, near Buchanan street. The
lot has a frontage of about 137:6 on the
north side of Broadway 137:6 west of
Buchanan, with a depth of 275 feet, ex
tending through to 'Vallejo street. The
purchaser was James L. Flood and the
price paid was JSO.OOO. It is understood
that Mr. Flood contemplates the removal
of the present building and the erection of
a $50,000 family residence on the site,
which commands a magnificent view of
the bay. The sale was madÂ« through
Thomas Magee & Sons. Among other

OFFICERS OF STATE ARE CAUGHT OFFERING
POSITIONS OF TRUST TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
New Scandal Disgraces the Administration of Gover
nor Gageâ James L King, a Prominent Citizen,
Makes a Remarkable Expose and Reveals the Ex=
istence of a Traffic in Notaries Public.
B. T. Smith, Representing Himself as the Agent of His Friend and
Benefactor, Henry C. Dibble, Receives Part Payment in a Dis=
honest Sale of an Important and Lucrative Position in the
Gift of the Governor.
HT. SMITH. ex-asstÃtant clerk J
of the Assembly, acting, as he j
claimed, for Assemblyman
Henry C. Dibble, representing I
the Forty-llrst District, and to
â whom Smith owed his position in the
'nture, has failed in a deal where
l y be endeavored to clear up $500 for j
Jubhle and himselt for securing the re- j
appointment nt James L. King of this i
city as a notary public.

that are vain," Bret Harte's "Heathen |
t/hinee" is a novice at crookedness in
comparison with the politicians who |

Birds of a Feather.
Assembiyman Dibble swears by the \
man from Mexico. Smith mad- him
self offensive at Sacramento lobbying
for Burns, and never made a pretext of j
earning by legitimate labor one cent- of
the $r. per diem he was drawing from j
the State Treasury as assistant clerk
of the Assembly. The clerkship with
out work was Smith's compensation for
buttonholing for Burns. Dibble's pay
for being faithful to the boss was.
among other things, the. promise that
hecould name two of the notaries public
who would be appointed by the Gov
i ernor for San Francisco.
This little chunk of patronage might
have been used by Dibble to reward his
followers or help pave his way back
Into office .-it the next election. Dibble
did not put it to any such use.
The natural propensity of the average
Burns tooter to gather in all the boodle
In sight â the genuine, good hard stuff â
made the idea of giving the plums
away, to gain future political
prestige. simply ridiculous. To
Dibble's lights, according to the
statements -of Smith, the Jobs
â were as so much merchandise; he con
sidered them of certain commercial
Value, and as such offered at least one
of them for sale. The price fixed was
5500.
King's Petition Ignored by Gage.
A righteous howl made directly to the
Governor by James L. King, whom
Smith had selected as the victim.
' spoiled the. trade, but the transaction
had reached the point where Smith act
ually received from King $150.
King's petition for reappointment was
one of the most formidable documents
that was ever sent from San Frai.cisco
to the Chief Executive of the. State. The
managers of all the insurance compa
nies, the representatives of every bank
ing institution in the city, besides many
Others of the greatest prominence and
standing in commercial circles, in
dorsed the 'well-known notary's peti
tion. The document was looked upon as
a matter of form only, and as a compli
ment to the Governor. No one ques
tioned but that the appointment would
follow in a few days. The petition was
Bled during the latter part of the ses
sion of the Legislature and it was
"hung up" for three months. No ac
knowledgment of it was received by
King, and the signatures of men repre
senting the business interests of a big
city were treated with contemptuous
silence. This is the only blame that is
attached to the Governor in this latest
1 scandal involving State officials.
The Weapons of Extortion.
It appears almost incredible that a
petition of the magnitude and impor
tance of Kings should receive no at
tention from the chief executive or any
of his secretaries. The treatment it re
celved seems little short of an outrage.
While it was perfectly reasonable,
and not at all beyond a legitimate
course, for the Governor to promise a
legislator a certain amount of political
patronage, the manner in which he ig
nored the King petition for nearly
three months made it possible for Dib
ble to attempt to barter a State office
and convert the Governor's favors
into weapons for extortion. ,
James L^ King's commission as a no
tary public expired just before the la^st
Legislature convened. Successive Gov
ernors for years back had reappointed
him without a question, and he con-
L. L. BROMWELL, WHO INTRODUCED SMITH.
sequently grew uneasy when he re
ceived no reply to his petition to Gov
ernor Gage. Some weeks passed and j
he spoke of the matter to his friend L..
L. Bromwell, the insurance agent and j
politician. Bromwell told him that he .
had no influence with the executive, j
but that he had a friend who was as- â¢
sistant clerk of the Assembly and was
able to reach Gage by reason of the
fact that he was close to Dan Burns.
Bromwell promised to write in Kings
b.-h;ilf to his friend in Sacramento.
In the course of a, few days H. T.
Smith left his work at the capital and
visited King. The matter of the lat
ter's appointment was discussed and
Smith expressed the opinion- that he [
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30. 1899.
would no difficulty In securing King a
commission without delay.
In his account book, at a date cor
responding with the day of Smith's
visit, King made this entry, 'Paid H.
T. Smith, expenses trip to Sacramento,
$20."
Money Paid to Smith.
Many of these trips were made. Mr.
King's accounts show five of them, each
at a cost to him of $20. On his second
or third visit to King Smith informed
the" notary that everything was fixed.
He told King that the Governor had
promised Assemblyman Dibble that he
could name the successors to Notaries
ASSEMBLYMAN DIBBLE, WHO HAS NOTARYSHIPS
FOR DISPOSAL.
Thomas O'Brien and Henry C. Droger,
both of San Francisco, whose commis
sions were about to expire.
Smith said he had talked "with Dibble,
who told him he had been offered $500
for the O'Brien place, but that King
would be given the preference at the
same figure. Mr. King demurred at
first, but finally agreed to the proposi
tion. He was to pay the money to
Smith as soon as the appointment was
made and his bonds approved.
Notary King at once fortified himself
with ton $50 banknotes and waited de
velopments. Knowing of King's trou
ble in securing reappointment a friend
inquired of him as to what progress he
was making.
NOTARY KING, THE INTENDED VICTIM.
"I have got it all arranged," replied
King, "but this is how I had to do it,"
at the same time displaying the bank
notes and explaining the nature of the
transaction. At King's request the
friend counted the currency. There
was just an even $500 in the roll.
Before the appointment was secured
at the figures named the notary again
visited Bromwell at his home in Mijl
Valley. This was about three weeks
ago. Bromwell was informed of what
arrangements had been made with
Smith and advised King not to pay a
cent for his commission, but to seek a
personal interview at onro with ihe
Governor, who was then in Sacramento
arranging for the opening of the State
Fair. King followed the advice. The
Governor expressed astonishment at
the situation and promised that King's
case would be attended to at once.
Since then he has received his com
mission. He was given the appoint
ment held by ex-Registrar P. F. Walsh,
who was- named by Governor Budd to
succeed King, but who was removed by
Governor Gage to make room for the
latter.
Where the Places Went.
The Thomas O'Brien place, which, ac
cording to Smith, Dibble was to sell to
King for $nOO, went to "Jack" Williams,
who is with the law firm of Bishop Â«&
Wheeler. Whether or not he paid for
the position, or is the man whom Smith
says Dibble stated offered $500 for it,
but would be "turned down" for King,
if the latter would come up with as*
large a sum, is a matter of conjecture.
Whon ' interviewed yesterday after
noon, Mr. King said:
"It is true thlh H. T. Smith came to
me with the statement that he could
secure my reappointment through
Judge Dibble if I would pay the Aa
semblyman $500. The excuse was that
Dibble had been offered that much for
the place, but would give me the pref
erence. I agreed to pay $500 for my
commission, for I could see no' other
way to get it. During our negotiations
I gave Sniith $100 in $20 installments
for his expenses in the matter, and
later gave him one of the ten $50 bank
notes I was keeping for Smith, under
his representation that it was to " â¢
paid to Dibble. Up to this afternoon I
have been expecting Smith to call for
the balance of the money, but he has
not put in an appearance.
"Since I made the agreement with
Smith I have had that money on my
person day and night, expecting that
either one of them might meet me and
hand me the commission, and I wanted
to be ready for them."
One. of the reasons that Smith has
not called to collect the remaining nine
banknotes, which he claimed would
have to be paid to Dibble, is that he has
been sick in bed. Smith Is an insurance
agent. The directory gives his address
as 869 Shntwell street. Inquiry there
last night brought the information from
the landlady that Smith had never re
sided there, but as they were great
friends he occasionally took dinner with
her. She directed the reporter to 3256
Twenty-second street. Here it was
learned that Smith was sick in bed and
refused to respond to the rappings on
his bedroom dour.
L. L. Bromwell yesterday corroborat
ed fully the statement showing his con
nection with the case. He said he act
ed only as a fri-end of King and had no
idea that he was setting him into a
bunko game when he appealed to Smith
to help him.
DIBBLE MAKES DENIAL.
He Also Makes Admissions When
His Memory Is Refreshed.
Judge Dibble was seen at his home
last night and at first denied any
knowledge of Smith or any traffic in
notary appointments.
"It's an infamous lie, sir! An in
famous lie!" was all the Assemblyman
could say when he caught his breath.
"Don't know Smith. Who is this
Smith, anyhow?"
Finally he called to mind that he had
applied to the Governor to give an
appointment to Matthew Harris, a
G. A. R. veteran, but insisted that
there was no money consideration.
Then he remembered that he had
spoken to Gage about renewing the
commission of Henry Droger.
"But there was no money about this,"
said Dibble. "Droger was an old clerk
of mine and I favored him for old
times sake. Let me think. Oh, yes, I
think I do remember this man 'Jack'
Williams. Young Bishop spoke to me
about him, but I do not recollect that
I did anything for him. My whole
light on the notary business was for
Harris.
"Now that you refresh my memory I
do know this H. T. Smith. It would
appear that he has been doing a little
business on.hlfl own hook. I.'issure you
that he gave me no part- of the $150 he
received from King. He asked me dur
ing the session of the Legislature to
assist him in getting King reappointed,
but, as I have already told you, Harris
was my man.
"I met Smith here in the city a week
or ten days ago and asked him how he
was progressing with the King appoint
ment. He told me that everything was
cr.-ming along all right. That is all 1
know about it and if Smith. was at
tempting to got any money from King
by the use of my name he was doing a
little business on his own hook and I
was not in on it."
