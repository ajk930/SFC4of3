The spirit of anti-Semitism has

that city and fought a bloody bat

the police to stop.
None of the boys were seriously
hurt, and only two were caught by
the officers. The feeling between
the different religionists is said,
however, to be growing in bitter
ness.
CHICAGO. June 20.â A pitrhed bat

THE NATAL
VOLUNTEERS
HELD READY
LONDON, June 21.â The Cape
Town correspondent of thp Daily
Mail says: The Natal volunteers
have been officially ordered to
hold themselves in readiness for

and strategy that miÂ£*ht stagger a mili
\pert.
'ill the first place, thf> Borrs of the
Transvaal are magnifWnt guerilla sol.
Their history ha? proved it and
they are fully up t<> their standard to
day. They aro expert marksmen, born
h riders, such as your own cow
boys, and their courage and tenacity is
undeniable. Individually thf-y are as
military stuff as the world r ir >s
b. They also are thoroughly con
vinced of the justice of their cause and
would di<> to a man at the word of
Oom Paul.
â¢But. aside from thHr morals and
ih^ir fitness, the Transvaal country |
is one admirably adapted for the pur
poses of defense. It is inland, with
large uninhabited space. An army in
vading it must have a distant base
and its supplies must he brought
through a s<-mi-tropiral country under
the most disadvantageous conditions.
Caoe Town is a thousand miles from
the Vaal River, and if an attack were
to be madÂ» fr<>m Natal there would b" '
1 last evening the lenders of both sides !
decided that the hattle must b<> heldâ
thai satisfaction could only be had in
j that way â and Immediately prepara- |
tii ms for the fight were made.
Th" Christians attend the numerous
parochial schools in the vicinity, and
they allege that the insults by the Jows
have been unbearable. On the other
hand, the Jewish boys say the Christ
ians time and again have attacked and
beaten them while they were on their 1
way to Bchool.
Both sides lined up their forces and i
a count showed them about evenly bal- j
anced. Henry and Fourteenth streets
was chosen as the scene of battle, and
early this morning residents In that
neighborhood became aware of the fact
1 that something was about to happen.
â¢ The boys began to assemble in the al
, leys', streets, yards and other places by
th>^ score. All grades of youth were
represented in the gathering, and judg- i
; ins? from their actions, the neighbors!
1 concluded something important was to j
. occur.
The boys made no disturbance for j
several hours, hut stood about in!
groups and in low voices discussed
their troubles and the proposed battle. !
Sentiment went from one point to an- )
other, and late risers were hurried from I
; their homes and marshaled to the field. J
Others came with their aims full of j
stones, clubs, mud" and missiles of vari- i
ous kinds to be used in the religious ;
war.
As the morninp advanced, the streets!
became crowded with juveniles, and at |
a signal both factions lined up on op- j
posite sides of the way and the hat- |
tie was begun. The Christians led the i
attack, and with stones and clubs
drove the Jewish boys half a block
down the street. The retreating ones, i
however, were reinforced and by sony- j
clever movements surrounded the I
Christians and the battle was on in ',
earnest. For a few minutes the air
was full of flying bricks, stones and j
clubs, and then the fighters came to
gether with a clash. A hand to hand
Btruggie followed, and the fighters
clubbed and beat one another right and
left. Blood flowed freely and many of
the youngsters received painful in
juries, but remained on the spot, and
witnesses say none left the field.
"Hurrah for the Christians."' shouted â 
the leader of that crowd, as his follow- j
era broke through the Jewish lines and I

mountains to -work through and much
tropical growth. The question of trans
portatlon would be eerlous. We wouM
need thousands of mules, which must
be brought from South America. The
ocean distance and the adverse climate
would kill the animals off by the hun
dreds, and the actual work would en
tail own Teater losses.
"There is a question of strategy as
well. The Boers would be difficult, to
hit in a mass. Indeed, they might not
be mobilized in a European sense at all. j
In an arid, rocky country filled with
splendid shots, with no real objective
point to capture, with a disaffected or
actively hostile population on your
Hank or rear, the conquest of the
Transvaal would be one of the most
arduous undertakings we ever entered
upon. In my opinion, no less than 60,000
men would be required. Tour own Phil
ippine war is not so different. Indeed,
it is folly to underestimate the mili
tary strength of the Transvaal, which
pro< eeds not alone from the material
character of the population but also
from the nature of the country itself.
"And the Boers are armed to the
teeth. The money raised by taxation
of Uitlanaers has been spent in arms
and artillery, so that the republic re
peats, on a small scale the military
campaign which the continental pow
ers exhibit on a great scale."
LONDON, June 21.â The Daily Tele
graph this morning says it under

the Transvaal Lieutenant General Sir
Redvers Henry Buller will be the com
mander of the British forces in South

The utmost precautions are be

The arrangements for the conveyance

Leo Likely to Take That Method of i
Allaying Discontent in South
America.
Filial Cabl? to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
The council of Latin- American
Bishops, called to Rome by the
Pope, seems likely to eventuate in
the development of a tendency on
the part of the Catholics of Mexico
and Central and South America to
share the spirit of the church as
demonstrated by its leaders in
North America rather than to
revert in its sympathies to the
Spanish hierarchy.
The Bishop of Bogota, one 01
the leaders of the council, voiced
, this sentiment when he said that
South American churchmen wanted
it understood that they were Amer
icans, and not Spanish.
ROME. June 20. â I met this morning
Monsignor O'Connell, the friend of
Monsignor Ireland, and ho confirmed
the announcement that the Archbishop
of St. Paul will shortly visit London.
The date of Monsignor Ireland"s re
turn to America is not yet settled, but
it is now certain that he will not go
bark to Rome before leaving Europe.
I took advantage of the opportunity
to ask the former rector of the North
American College his opinion on the
â work of the Latin-American Council,
now sitting at Rome.
MonÃignor O'Connell seemed to think
that there exist* a sort of antaronfftm
or latent dualism between the < 'atho
lics of North and South America.
When the South American Council was
convoked by the Pope, there was an
impression in the United States that it
was intended to consolidate Latinism
in the New vrorld in order to oppose
it to Americanism* which prevails in
the North. a~ ' this impression re
mains. If such were the object of the
Council, it will have no influence upon
the Catholics of the United States,
from whom those of L,atin America,
from Mexico to Cape Horn, are more
remote than those of Europe. But since
the arrival in Rome of the Bishops
summoned to the Council. Monsignor
n'Connell's personal impressions have
been modified. He has observed with
pleasure that the South American
Episcopate is not so much animated by
Spanish ideas as in the past, and that
it is not, like the Spanish Episcopate,
more Catholic than the Pope and
blindly obedient to the will of the Ro
man Curia.
A certain amount of bad humor pre
vails among the members of the South
American Episcopate, who openly com
plain that they have been neglected by
the Vatican. The Pope and those in
immediate contact with him perceive
this and are seeking how the discon
tent may be dissipated. Monsignor
O'Connell believes that a South Ameri
can Cardinal will be created shortly.
Doubtless the possibility of this crea
tion induced the majority of the coun
cil not. to elect its president, but to re
quest tlip Pope to appoint him, with the
idea that the president chosen by the
Pontiff would be the Bishop destined to
be raised to the purple.
In any case, whatever may be the
resolutions of the council, they will in
no way modify the conditions of exist
ence or the tendency of Catholicism in
Anglo-Saxon America.
Such, In brief, are the views of Mon
signor OTonnell, expressed to me in
the course of a short conversation.
Before leaving I informed him that
Archbishop Restrepo of Rogota wished
it to be known that the members of the
council are not Spaniards, but Ameri
cans, and that their sympathies, es
pectally in matters of religion, .are not
with Spain, but with the Americans, as
religion is understood and practiced in
thf> United States, and that this truth
will sooner or later be recognized at the
Vatican.
"It may be so," said Monsignor
O'Connell. shrugging his shoulders.
"Archbishop Restrepo is very intel
ligent, serious and broad-minded, but
the rest, or at any rate most of them,
think otherwise."

THE SULTAN IS IN FEAR OF
WAR WITH SERVIA.
SENDS AN ENVOY TO THE FRONTIER
D ERLIN, June 20. -The Turkish Embassador here
*-* has received instructions from tne Sultan in
compliance with which he at once started for the
scene of the Turco-Servian frontier troubles. He
is instructed to go as near as possible by rail to the
scene of conflict and then to post on as fast as
horses can carry him. The Sultan takes the matter
in a serious light, and wants to know the truth
without delay.
BOURGEOIS MAY BE THE
PREMIER OF FRANCE.
PARIS. June 20.â President Loubet
has asked M. Bourgeois, who Is
head of the French delegation at
The Hapue. peace conference, to
form a Cabinet.
The prolongation of the Cabinet crisis
is becoming most serious. MM. Dupuy
and Lockroy both called on President
Loubet day and expressed their
anxiety to he relieved of the responsi
bilities of office as soon as possible. It
is reported orders have been sent to
St. Michaels, Azores, directing the com
mander of the French cruiser Sfax,
which is bringing Captain Dreyfus to
France, to remain there a short time
so as not to arrive in home waters un
til the new Ministry is installed.
Should M. Bourgeois accept the task
of forming a ministry it is thought his
chances of success would be fairly
good. His prestige has been much in
creased by the part he played in the
deliberations of the peace conference at
The Hague.
The latest gossip favors a combina
tion Cabinet, including MM. Bourgeois,
Brisson, Poincaire and TValdeck-Rous
seau, but nothing will be known until
M. Bourgeois arrives.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau. discussing his
failure, is reported to have said: "I
met with the utmost friendliness and
straightforwardness from my former
adversaries, but found only treason and
cowardice among my old allies."
It will be remembered that in the
crisis of isor,. M. Bourgeois formed a
Cabinet for President Faure, the body
being composed exclusively of mem
bers of the Radical party. "With the
exception of the Dreyfus developments
the condition then was similar to that
existing at present.
NO INDEMNITY
TO BE PAID
TO GERMANS
This Government Believes
Kautz Is Right, and Will
Support Him.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
June 20. â Considerable astonishment is
expressed in official circles at the an
nouncement of Herr yon Bulow yes
terday at the attitude of Germany on
thf> kingshln and indemnity questions
growing out of the Samoan contro
versy. Herr yon Bulow's statement
â¢was that a demand will he made
by the German Government "for
full indemnification of Germans
whose property was destroyed by
illegal British or American ac
tion." It is regarded as highly im
portant and presents a serious phase of
the controversy. This Government. I
was told by an administration official,
feels that Admiral Kautz, in endeavor
ing to re-cptablish peace and order in
Samoa, acted in accordance with the
recognized provisions of international
law and the Berlin treaty, and the au
thorities here will most certainly re
ject any claims filed against us by the
German Foreign Office.
The authorities declarp that the real
responsibility for the Samoan trouble
rests upon the official representatives
of Germany at Apia, who started and
assisted the Mataafans in the In
surrection as a result of the decision
of the Chief Justice on the kingship
question, made in accordance with the
terms of the Berlin act, and that if
Germany desires to indemnify her sub
jects for their losses she will have to
settle their claims herself.
It appears from Herr yon Rulow's
statement that he has advices later
than those in possession of the State
Department. The authorities have been
informed of the reception and examina
tion of Malietoa Tanu and Mataafa,
but they have not been officially ad
vised of the release of Huffnagle and
Marquardt, the two Germans arrested
on charges of alleged complicity in the
operations of Mataafa's men.

COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo.. June
20. â Thirty-eight recruits from "Water

through this city to-day on their way
to San Francisco. They were almost
on the puint of starvation, having ex
hausted their five- days' rations because
of a delay <>n the trip and having no
money to buy more provisions. The
women of the Red Cross Society here
immediately went to the depot. Thf*
recruits were priven breakfast at the
hotel and were started westward with
a supply of eatables and 50 cents each
in money. The local Red Cross So
ciety may investigate the matter, as
they felt indignant at the way the re

BERESFORD IN
SLOAN'S DEFENSE
, Nobleman Describes the
Ascot Incident.
JOCKEY HIT THE WAITER
HIS PROVOCATION, HOWEVER,
WAS GREAT.
American Has Received Unfair Treat
ment and Fought an Uphill
Battle on the English
Tracks.
Special Dispatch to The ("all.
LONDON, Juno 26.â The Evening News
to-day publishes an interview with Lord
William Beresford. who Is quoted as giv
ing an account of the Incident at Ascot,
In corroboration of the statements of Tod
Sloan, the American jockey, regarding the
Insults of the waiter and the hitter's in
, tentional upsetting of the tahle. l>ird
Beresford .t.Med:
"At this Sloan and his companion went
for the waiter, the latter hitting the
waiter in the face with his list, while
Sloan hit him with a champagne bottle,
which, however, was not broken. Of
course we In England regard an attack
with a bottle as despicable and as bad as
drawing a knife, but in Sloan's case there
, was. Brst, great provocation. The waiter
undoubtedly began the quarrel. Secondly,
â  the waiter was a great, hulking chap,
weighing L'2-t pounds, while Slnan is a little
: man. incapable of fighting him on ecjual
'â  terms. SJoan was sober. Before you
â  judge him to.) harshly, think of what he
has gone through. He wns first made a
popular hero and latterly a strong tide
i f opposition has set in against him. pre
sumably because people have lost money.
"Certainly, the jockey club will not &us-
I>tn<i his license. The case is not within
its jurisdiction. When he was previously
1 unfairly tnated it did not interfere be
cause we believe in letting him fight bis
' own battles, and there is no doubt he has
had a battle to fight. We have had an-ny
, rnous letters saying Sloan is a dead man
; if he does not leave England immediately,
Tin public ought to be Informed of the
t;..it provocation under which Sloan
acted."
The anti-Sloan demonstration which
was expected to take place at the Gat wick
meeting to-day did not materialize. 1 hero
was some cheering when his mount won
the selling handicap.

These and other shouts filled the air.
and crowds of older people gathered on
the sidewalks and many of them tried
to disperse the boys, only to be driven
from the field.
By this time many of the boys were
I covered with blood flowing from
! wounds, while some had their clothing
torn to ribbons. The â¢ olice were sum
moned, but the small squad first on the
scene could do nothing with the now
thoroughly maddened fanatics, and a
riot call was rung in. This brought two
patrol wagons loaded with bluecoats.
As they rushed on the field wtih clang

fled. The police attempted to run them

1 In a few weeks the vessel will undergo a
; marked change in appearance. She is
now at the Norfolk navy-yard and has
only recently come out of the drydock
: where her rudder and propeller blades
were taken off.
Among the improvements to be mad*
i will be a new electric light plant, ten am
munition hoists similar to those installed
in the cruiser Newark at the navy yard
; last summer and a change In her rig/The
' electric light plant now on the San Fran
! Cisco will be placed in the tug Apache,
which is to be convertd into a lightboat
and used in lighting vessels that are out
; of commission or that may be undergoing
repairs.
The San Francisco's rig when completed
will be almost identical with that of the
Newark, which has only two masts. By
i doing away with the other mast it is said
j that the space Tor the ship's crew can be
made much more comfortable than now,
and besides this vessel Is relieved of a
! great amount of unnecessary weight in
a craft of her dimensions. This wftrk will
be started about July 1.

j the acquisition of the Bancroft the
1 sailing frigates Constellation and Con

â  the purpose, and when the sailing craft
j became worn out Congress appro

auxiliary steam and full sail power.
The Bancroft was first commissioned
in 1R93, but it was then discovered that
I she was entirely too small and that

i gahela, from which the machinery had
i been removed, to serve as a practice
I ship, and up to last August, when the
Bancroft was transformed into a gun
boat and sent to the Mediterranean,
the academy got. along fairly well.
The Secretary of the Navy asked
t'ongress for two practice ships for the
â  Naval Academy and his request was
i complied with to the extent of allow

MARYSVILLE. June 20.â The military
election heia in the Armory of Company
D last night resulted In the re-election of
Captain Voss. Serjeant Warniok Wal
dron was chosen second lieutenant by a
launched at the Bath Iron Works to

The general appearance of the new
practice ship is very pleasing and is
the design of Chief Constructor Hich
born. The principal measurements are:
Length on water line, 175 feet; beam at
water line, 37 feet; mean draught, 16
feet 6 inches; displacement, 1100 tons.
'The hull is built of steel and sheathed
with wood and coppered to avoid fre
quent docking. The ship has no bow
sprit, ihe stem being run out as far as
where the bowsprit cap would be and
with the bulwarks forms the sleeve for
the jibboom. The lower masts and yards
are of steel to insure strength with
lightness. V. Ith her good beam the new
craft is able to spread a large sail area
amounting to a total of 19,958 square
feet and 13,091 square feet of plain sails.
None of the yards are interchangeable,
as is now the practice in merchant
ships. The main and fore yard are 78
and 6* feet, respectively, and the same
relative differences are carried out with
the other yards.
The Chesapeake is flush spardecked",
and the accommodations are all on the
gun and between decks for a captain,
i ten wardroom officers, two warrant
officers, ninety seamen and one hun
i dred and eighty cadets. The armament
for gunnery drill will consist of six 4
inch rapid-fire guns on the gun deck
and four 6-pounders and two 1-pound
ers on the spar deck. The ship will
carry eight boats, one of them a steam
cutter.
It is the opinion of a majority of the
older officers in the navy that seaman
ship can only be properly taught in a
sailing vessel, hence the substitution
of the sail practice ship for the steam
ers originally asked for.

Irish Champion Gives Evidence
of Fear on Entering
the Ring.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 20.â Peter Maher. the
Irish heavy-weight pugilist, scored a
j quick victory over his fellow countrym in.
1 Mike Mdrrissey of Tipperary, before the
Lenox Athletic Club to-night Morrissey
had been heralded a? an invincible Irish
champion- Maher sized his man up quick
ly and went for him. There was appar
ently no fight in the newcomer. A llafht
punch on the breast and a right cross to
the jaw were the only blows struck, mid
| these were delivered by Maher. The blow
that Maher landed on the jaw was insuf
ficient to knock out any man.
Maher weighed 174 pounds and looked
well. Morrissey had a retinue of handlers
when he reached the ringside and said he
weighed 182 pounds. The moment the men
shaped it was clearly evident that Morri-
sey was afraid and that Maher had the
easiest task ever given him.
Both fiddled for a few moments and
then Maher went right for his man with <*
light left lead, which landed- lightly on
the chest, and sent his right over to ftie
jaw Morrissey fell in a neutral corner
and lay there Vesting on h.s right elbow.
! while Maher strutted about the ring until
i the referee counted off ten seconds. Maher
1 then walked to his corner and the master
! of ceremonies announced that Maher had
. won and that the time of the bout was 35
j seconds.
Maher a Pronounced Favorite.
Although this was Morrisey's first fight
in America, there was not much interest
taken here in his debut. In the mutual
betting at Corbett's he found Home sup
porters, but Mahrr*was chiefly in demand
on every line.. The mutuals paid $4 05 on
each dollar invested. In the straight Bet
ting Maher opened favorite at 10 to 9. The
betting then went to even money. Just
before the men entered the ring Maher
became a pronounced favorite at 4 to L
The bulk of the money was placed at "his
price. ______________

Tlif report of the sub-eommlttee will

The plenary conference- met to adopt
these additional articles and appointed a
committee to draw up a general ad to
bodying the report of the Geneva cony m
tion section. This is the first definite re
sult of the > nnference.
WASHINGTON. June 20.â Private ad
vices received here from a high authority
are to the effect that the conference at
Tho Hague probably will be redeemed nom
inally from failure through an agreement
on an arbitration project that will satisfy
the apparently general demand on that
point, but which at the prime time, by
carefully framed safeguards, will so nar
row the field of matters that may or must
L-.i before the arbitration tribunal as to
make it little more than arbitration in
name. The attitude of Germany is Bald
to be only a little in advance of that of
some of the others in opposition to the
; plans submitted, and tho disaffection is
more general than it appears on the sur
: face.
As for the other projects that were esp?
--â¢ dally desired by the Americans, such .is
protection of individual property from
seizr.ro at sea, they have all been irre-
I deemably lost, according to this report.
PLANTATION OVERSEER

Wounds Received While Putting
in a Cane Trolley.
HON'OLT'LU. Junp U.â Herbert W.
Dickey, an overseer on the Haiku Maul
plantation, met with a frightful accident
on thf 7th iriKt. and did not recover from
his Injuries. The Haiku Sugar Company's

end of the wire cable was anchored to
two pieces of t\xO scantling, six feet loiik,
laid about two feet deep, upon which was
a strain of over four tons, being the ten-
Blon of about a half mile of the cable.
Herbert Dickey had charge of the Kalu
anui part of the plantation and was there
with H. A. Baldwin, the manager, to see
that all went well. About 11 o'clock he
was sitting on some cane trash, with Mr.
Baldwin standing beside him. about fit
teen feet from the anchor braces, while
some Portuguese were trying to draw the
cable a little tighter. Suddenly some one
cried "Look out!" the earth gave way
;m<l one of the beams flew out of its
trench and struck Herbert Dickey Bquare
in the face, crushing it in a frightful
manner and knocking him .senseless.
The young man lingered for ten hours
and then died. He was but 24 years of
age and was born in this country.

Retaliating 1 for the Recent Cut
in the Rates to the
Klondike.
Special Plspatrh to Thp Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. June 20.â News was
received here to-day that the seizure of
the river steamer Kllburne by the North
western police reported by those who ar
rived on the steamer Tees was but the
preliminary step to a far greater seizure.
The whole fleet of the t'pper Yukon Navi
gation Company is to be seized â three
launches and nine river steamers. The
charge on which the Kilburne was ar
rested was that she was carrying pas
sengers without beinp licensed. The
cause given for the seizure of the other
vessels, which are to be taken nt the in
stance of the Canadian customs by the
police, is that they are plying without
being registered and, moreover, are con
traband, us they are American vessels
and no duty has been paid on them.
According to the story told by some of
those in the Yukon transportation busi
ness, there is something behind the pro
jected seizure of the Upper Yukon Com
pany's fleet. As will be remembered, it
' was this company that initiated the rate
war which brought the inbound fare down
considerably, and if the stories which are
common talk at Rennett are to be believed
the hand of the customs authorities is
being: put forward at thf instance of the
big Canadian transportation lines, who
fear the rivalry of the American-owned
line.
The T'pper Yukon Navigation Company
is a Seattle company, owned by A. F. H.
Kilburne. It cut the rates from $100 to
1 Jfi". and started the rate war which re
sulted in the establishment of the ridic
j ulously low rate of $10 to Dawson by the
! Canadian Development Company. The
i rates were afterward raised by a combi
| nation of several lines, but tho T'pper
Yukon Company stayed out of the com
i bination and threatened to again precipi-
I tate a rate war. To avert this, it is al
leged, the customs people have been in
duced to seize the steamers.

Phelps Go Free.
EVIDENCE NOT CONCLUSIVE
JONES, SAMPSON AND KENNETT
ARRAIGNED.
Case Is Dismissed After Their Story
of the Accident Near San Car
los Is Told to the
Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. June 20.â Justice 6t
the Peace James Harmon this morning
dismissed the charge of manslaughter pre
ferred against Thomas Jones. Frank
Sampson and Frederick Kennett for bay
ing caused the death of Timothy Guy i
Phelps on May 30. On the morning of that
day Mr. Phelps was run down by a tan- j
dem bicycle ridden by Jones and Sampson
nei r San <'ar!os. Kennett had passed Mr.
Phelps without accident, but the tandem
struck him in the back, causing him to
fall and strike on his head, from the ef- j
fects of which he died on the morning of j
June 11. The young men surrendered
themselves to the authorities of San Fran
cisco as soon as they learned the result
of the accident, and were brought to this
place for examination. They obtained I
their release on bail last Tuesday and ap- !
peared in court this morning with their
counsvl.
The District Attorney took the testi- j
mony of Janus Mayers, the only eye-wit
ness of the accident other than the young!
men themselves. He testified that about
7 o'clock on the morning of May '.',(), as he
was on his way to the ranch of Mr. Hull,
for whom he was working, he met Mr.
Phelps near San, Carlos coming south j
along the county road. Coming in
itie same direction as Mr. Phelps, and a
short distance behind him, was the tan
den ridden by Jones and Sampson. When
about opposite the rear wheel of Mayers'
wagon Mr. Phelps was struck by the
riders and thrown to the ground. Mayors
stopped his horses and went to the assist
ance of the injured man. helping him to
the wagon and taking him to his home
near by. Mayers thought that by using
more care the bicycle riders could have
passed Mr. Phelps without danger, the
road being sufficiently wide at that place.
Jones and Sampson testified in their own
behalf. They said they ipft San Fran
cisco between 5 and *i o'clock that morn
ing for Los Gatos. They met Mr. Phelps
near San Carlos and could easily have
passed between him and the milk wagon
that they met at the same place had he
kept a straight course. Just as they were
about to pas? he stepped toward the cen
ter of the road and immediately In front
of their wheel, rendering the accident un- ;
avoidable. They had no intention of in
juring him and In fact slowed up their
wheel before reaching him.
Frederick Kennett testified that he was
riding a single wheel in advance of the
tandem and that he passed between Mr.
Phelps and the wagon. As he passed he
called to him to look out, meaning to
give warning that another wheel was
coming behind. He said the tandem had
a bell which he thought could have been 1
heard above the noise of the milk wagon. I
The defendants had witnesses present to I
testify to their good characters, but the
court thought it unnecessary. The Dis
trict Attorney believed the evidence
would not warrant the holding of the de
fendants for trial, and the court dis
missed the charge.

LEGAL CONFLICT
OVER A CHILD
O. A. Lowe Gains Partial
Victory.
DIVORCE DECREE MODIFIED
FATHER GIVEN POSSESSION OF
LITTLE LUCILLE.
Having Won This Victory, It Now
Remains for Him to Wrest the
Girl From His Former
Wife.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, June 20.â Judge Gaddis
has rendered a decision modifying the
decree of divorce in the case of Lowe
vs. Lowe. The domestic infelicities of
( '. A. Lowe and his divorced wife. Hat
lie E. Lowe, have been described in The
j Call. The case has become notorious
, on account of the prominence of the
' principals and the sensational flight of
Mrs. Lowe from the United States, in
j order to avoid the processes of the
; court.
In November, lS9f>. judgment was en
j tered in the Superior Court of Yolo
tountv in favor of Mrs. Lowe upon
her cross-complaint to Mr. Lowe's
I complaint for divorce. It was ordered
that Lucille Lowe, a minor child, be
awarded to her father with the proviso
that Mrs. Lowe, at certain times and
under certain circumstances, should be
I entitled to enjoy her society. Another
condition Â«>f the doeree was that in the
1 event of the marriage of Mr. Lowe so
much of the decree as related to the
custody of the child should be null and
Void.
After one of these- stipulated monthly
visits Mrs. I. owe clandestinely left the
I I'nited States, taking with her the
child. That was over a year after the
divorce was granted. She was first
; heard from in Honolulu. There was
some correspondence in reference to ex
tradition, but the Attorney General of
tin- Sandwish Islands did not encour
; age that method of regaining posses
sion of the child.
After several months Mrs. Lowe and
: the child again disappeared and all
trace of them was lost until ISPS, when
Mrs. Lowe was located in British Co
lumbia. She was discovered under the
J name of Mrs. Simpson and later the
; child was found in a convent school in
Spokane under the same name.
Iti the meantime a writ was issued
I from the Superior Court of this county
citing Mrs. Lowe to appear and show
cause why she should not be adjudged
' guilty of contempt of court. After
much difficulty this writ was served
; last January. During the latter part of
i February another writ was served cit
ing her to appear and bring with her
; her child. This motion was granted
' upon a notice served upon her attor
neys and the clerk of the court, she re
: siding out of t;.e State.
She failed to obey the citation and
Judge Gaddis rendered the decision
I heretofore referred to.
The modification of the decree has
ii t yet been prepared, hut it will pro
vide that Mr. Lowe shall have absolute
control of the child. Just what proceed
ings will then be taken in order to re
cover the child has not yet developed,
but it is probable that Mr. Lowe,
through his attorney, C. W. Thomas,
! will apply for a writ of habeas corpus.

SUES FOR REALTY
WORTH A MILLION
Major Pico Claims Part
of San Jose.
LAND WAS SOLD FOR TAXES
BELONGED TO THE LATE GOV
ERNOR PICO.
Residents of a Thickly Settled Dis
trict Styled "Squatters" in Legal
Documents Soon to Be
Filed.
Special r>i=ratrh to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 20.â Major Jose Ramnn
Pico, son of the late Governor Pico, will
shortly try to recover (1,000,000 worth of
the best business property in this city,
which he claims was wrested from him
by squatters. Papers are being pre
pared, and it is said suit will he com
menced within two weeks. Senator More
house of this city is one of the counsel
retained by Pico.
The suit will cause consternation among
the property-owners, but it is doubtful
if the major will live long enough to en
joy the property it" he wins, for a long
and determined legal battle must be
fought. The property-owners will band
together and fight every move, and
some express doubt that the land can be
recovered, if there is any defect to the
title, at this late day.
The property Involved i.- conservatively
estimated to be worth $1,000,000. It begins
at rian Fernando and Fourth streets,
thence south with Fourth street to San
Antonio, thence west with San Antonio
to City Hall plaza, thence north with
Market striH-t to San Fernando, thence
east with San Fernando to Fourth, the
place of beginning.
This takes in much valuable property.
On the east and west sides of First street
are solid Mocks oj business houses. The
same may be said of Second street. On
Third and Fourth streets the land is not
<)uite so valuable. There is good busi
ness property on Market and 1 1 i - â¢ south
side of San Fernando, from the Postoffice
to First.
Of late much data has been collected.
It is understood that a majority of
Pico's lawyers arc Kastern men. The
land which belonged to Governor !';â  i
was sold for taxes while he was away
and while Major Pico was fighting for
his country. Those now occupying the
land will be deemed squatters, for it is
held they have no better title. While
the tax sale will be an important point
in the suit, there will be many other
questions raised. One is the violation of
a specific contract which had been made
providing for the care of the property
and the payment of the taxes. The
property had been rented to r. <>. Minor
in ISfiO for a period or' twenty years at a
rental of $50 a month. Minor to care for
the property and pay the taxes. Minor
paid rent for five months and then
abandoned it. Major Pico was then in
the service of the I'nited States.
The title t<> the City Plaza on which
the City Hal! now stands is to be con
tested. Pico had Liven it to the city for
a site for the State Capitol, but one wa.s
never erected and the plaza was put to
other use. This, it is claimed, released
the city's right to the land.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING- j
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 20.â I
I'ollowlng the statement of Lieutenant i
Commander Hodgson regarding the events
hat occurred on the bridge of the Brook- '
lyn July 3, the Nevy Department to-day
made public the following report from
Captain Chadwick of his examination of i
Lieutenant Commander Heilner:
V. S. S. New York, Boston, Mass . June 10,
1899.
sir- In obedience to the order? of the Secre
tary of the Navy, I have the honor to make
the following report of an examination of
Lieutenant Commander Heilner, with respeci.
to his knowledgi of a conversation reported to .
have occurred between Hear Admiral S< hley j
and Lieutenant Commander Hodgson regarding i
the action of July 3, lw Lieutenant Com- I
mander Heilner ftatfs as follows:
"At one of the early sessions of the board (
on ship's position during the action of July 3. i
I strongly expressed my doubt as to the Brook
lyn'i position before making the trip as laid '
down by Lieutenant Hodgson. Several other |
navigators, Mr. Con ley and Mr. Scwetz, I know '
t-lde<l with me. Mr. Hodgson and I, on this ]
particular occasion, walked up and down the j
port side of the cabin of the Brooklyn, in which j
:he board was sitting. It is my impression that !
Mr. Hodgson claimed that the Brooklyn was â¢
UOfl yards from the leading Spanish Fhip when
the turn was made. The board. I think, put j
It later at 14W yards. Mr. Hodgson told me !
that he felt certain they were closer than 1400 |
>ards, and that their stadimeter gave *â >â ' yards. I
He said: "We were bo close that Schley nave I
the order "Hard a-port." I Lid to htm: "You I
mÂ«nn starboard, do you?"' The commodore said: j
"So, I mean port, we are close enough to them I
now." Mr., Hodgson said he thpn called Ltten
tlon to the position of the Texas, and told the !
commodore he thought there was danger of i
running her down. The commodore replied: !
"D n the Texas, let her look out for herself."
This conversation was repeated to me on Bey- j
ernl occasions.
Everything I say now was contained in Mr. |
Hodgson's statement. The words may have j
been a little different. He may have said: j
"Don't you mean starboard, commodore?" In- i
stead of the first phraseology. He certainly !
said, "We are near enough to them now," and i
llso "D n the Texas: let her loik out fr her- j
self." Ho repeated this conversation to me at j
least throe times during the sessions of the I
board, because every time a discussion arose
I recurred to the position given by him, which
I did not think correct. I placed no depend
ence on any observation by stadimeter or sex- |
tant during gun fire. My experience was that |
during the action I could not get a ell â¢'â¢â¢ ob- j
nervation by the standimeter on which I could j
place any confidence, though I was using two j
Ftandimeters and had a man on the conning .
tower with cleaning material, whose only duty
was to try to keep the glasses clean. with i
the utmost care this could not be done. I |
tried keeping the stadimeter under my coat, ]
but It was no use. I mention this us a reason j
for the doubts which brought up the discus
sion. The report as published was practically
the conversation as repeated to me.
Lieutenant Heilner appends his signature as l
an attest to the accuracy of the report here- I
with given. Very respectfully,

The 1 -trial Commission Is Also
Told That Railroads Injured Pro

orbitant Rates.
Special Dispatch to The
WASHINGTON, June 20.â The Indus
trial Commission to-day continued its In
vestigation of the agricultural conditions
of the South. J. Poik Brown, pr< -
of the Agricultural Society of Georgia,
was the first witness. He airr 1 with
Mr. Barrett, who tesi terday that
the condition of agriculture in the South
was more depressed than it had ever been.
Me>r< i Pie were plowing barefooted and
barebacked than ever before. He agreed
with the late Henry Grady that the fault
was not with the soil or climate nor. as
many had claimed, was it entirely with
the tariff. One of the most prolific causes
of the trouble was in the fact that cjt
ton was pra< tically the only crop. An
other cause, he asserted, was that the
ation was not sufficiently practical.
As far as the colorea race was con
cerned, there was no opening for them In
trade or in the professions. Mr. Brown
dwelt on the presence of the negro as the
special cause of the want of development
of the South. He regarded him as re
tarding the industrious, moral, religious,
social and agricultural development of the
section and he felt that If he were
absent a better class of labor would take
his place. The more the negro was paid
the less efficient he was as a laborer.
Mr. Brown wanted the race separated
from the whites and colonized, either In
this country or elsewhere, In the interests
of the Southern State.-. Hut the rac* is
non-progressive and indisposed to adopt
new methods and new devices. The great
obstacle in the way of the development
of the manufacturing interests was the
want of money. â .
Mr. Brown advocated diversified crops,
recommending that each community
should raise sufficient of everything to
meet its own demand.
At the afternoon session the commission
listened to a statement by P. H. Lovejoy,
a merchant and planter of Hawklnsville,
Ga. He spoke especially of the relations
of the local merchants and the farmers;
The merchants themselves had not been
prosperous for several years. They wer-j
compelled to make the majority of their
Bales on credit, and had to take mort
gages upon the lands of the farmer, if they
had any. or on their crops if they had no
lands. "Many of them were not able to
give collateral of any value, and to such
men pales were made on large margins of
profits. â ,
"We size a man up," he said. "If he is
good we sell to him on a small margin.
if he is a hard case we take what he has
and quit."
He said that freight rates from Georgia
to New York were about twice what they
are from New York to Georgia. The larsre
cities were evidently being built up at the
expense of the country. Even the water
melon crop was unfavorable. "We have
found that in shipping melons we pay the
freight." he said. "The railroads cut us
out of profits in that business."
DECLARES COURSING
A VIOLATION OF LAW
Los Angeles Justice Renders a De
cision Against Promoters of
the Sport.
LOS ANGELES. June 20.â D. Black
this morning received the first heavy
blow in his struggle with the Humane
Society. Colonel Black, as manager of
the Agricultural Park Coursing Club, is
Interested in the sport and minks that it
ought to continue. The Humane Society
dorp not agree with him.
On Saturday arguments for and against
the existence of coursing in this State
were heard by Justice James in Town
ship Court. This morning he gave his
decision against the colonel and against
the sport, and says coursing is a viola
tion of the law. in his decision Justice
James, after detailing the manner of
catching and killing harts during cours
ing games, says:
It Is a question Which has never boon directly
passed ur> 'ii by any appellate court, ms far as
can be ascertained The words torture," "tor
ment" and "cruelty" In the statute are held
to Include every act. omission or neglect where
b unnecessary or un*"Â«Mflable physical pain
or Buffering is caused or permitted. To cap
ture or to destroy a hare in Its wild state Is
rightâ that is not denied but having been re
duced from Its wild condition to a state of cap
tlvitv I believe a person seeking to destroy it
must adopt means of killing likely to produce
the least pain and suffering:.
Colonel Black to-night determined to
appeal the case to the Superior Court.

and secured an alternative injunction
againsi M. J. Dowd, Assessor of Shoshone
County, restraining that official from Bell-
Ing the propi rty of the Bunker Hill p.rd

The writ is made returnable in Han Fran-,

by Assessor Dowd and equalized by :ne j

The petition for the writ contains the
following statement, which, in view iif
the condition of affairs in Shoshone
County, Is Very significant: "That the dt
-1 crimination against the complainant in
these valuations Is born from the fact that
these mining companies which employ la
borers and miners In their mines and min
ing operations known as members of lab >r
unions only had their property assessed
of like character and class of that of the
complainant at about 50 per cent less than
x):c complainant and. as affiant verily l><*
liaves, that this was done willfully as
punishment because the complainant comp
any refused to exclude from its employ
ment miners and laborers who did not be
lonfil to BUCh labor organizations."
Proceeding, the petition states that
Dowd and the members of the Hoard of
County Commissioners were elected by
the miners' union, and that those officers
have discriminated against the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan because of the latter' a
, refusal to employ only union men.

HER INITIATION
STOCKTON, June 20.â Oak I^eaf Chapter, Order of Eastern Star of Oak
land, has claimed an honor which the ladies and gentlemen composing
Home Chapter No. 50 of this city feel belongs to them.. Interest in the con

For the first time in the history of thp Order <jf the Eastern Star in this State,
a young lady was Initiated into a chapter of the order by hr>r mother and f;itlior.

last Thursday night in Oak Leaf Chapter of Oakland, and thp candidate was
Miss Gertrude, the charming daughter of Past Grand Patron John Boston Mer
ritt and Mrs. Merritt. both past grand officers of the chapter.
The records of Home Chapter of Stockton show that this honor and un
usual fraternal event belongs here. Home must therefore disillusionize Oak
Leaf Chapter. â¢
.Miss Lucia N. Keniston was initiated into the local chapter January IH.
1897, by her parents, Charles M. Keniston and Nellie W. Keniston, both
past prand officers of the chapter.

WHILE CARS ARE STONED.
Mob Surrounds the South Side Barns

Soon Be Settled.
Special Dispatch to Thp Call.
CLEVELAND, June 20.â While the pros
pecta for a settlement of the strike of the
street railway men are brighter to-night
than they have been at any time since the
trouble began, there has been more seri
oua rioting to-day than at any previous
time.
The disturbance? began early in the
morning and continued throughout the
day, and to-night a big mob surrounds
the south side barns of the Big Consoli
dated Company, determined to get at the,
non-union men housed there.
While the sympathizers of the strikers ;
were hurling bricks and stones at the non
union motormen and conductors a special
committee of the City Council was trying
to get the representatives of the Btrikers
and the offlteers of the company together,
and it succeeded to the extent of inducing
the Btrikers to submit a proposition i.i ;
writing and g.-tttng the consent of Presi
dent Everett of the Kig Consolidated to
submit the same to the board of directors
in the morning. The strikers' proposition
abandons the demand for the recognition
of the union, but asks that all the old men
be tak.n back save those who may be
convicted in court of destroying property.
The members of the Council committee
believe a settlement is in sight.
As has been the rule since the strike be-
Ban riotous disturbances broke put to-day
about noon. A crowd boarded a Wade
and Park avenue car near Lindus and
Anndale avenues and beat the non-union
motorman into insensibility. The con
duct o, tied from his car. Another Wade-
P-irk avenue car was stoned, and one on
1 Euclid avenue line was attacked.
Many women were on board and shrinked
with terror as stones crashed through the |
car windows. One woman tainted. j
At the corner of Wilson avenue and
QuUicy Street one man was shot and oth- \
ers had narrow escapes. The passengers :
iscaDfcd as best they COUld when the,
stones began to fly. but the conductor and I
motorman were struck repeatedly. The |
fStter drew a revolver and tired three
times into the crowd. He then put on all

was hit In thl leg by a bullet, which was
extracted. No arrests were made.
I ate this afternoon at Central and Wil
son avenues a crowd of 2000 persons ob
structed the passage of two cross-town
cars Bricks were thrown and the win
dows of the cars broken. One of the non- ,
union motormen was hit by a brick and |
so badly injured that it was necessary
to send' him to a hospital. Later a car
on the south fide line was attacked near
the suburb of Brighton. The motorman
and conductor were chased into the woods
by a mob.
"The people of the smith side nursed
their wrath all day. They made no at
tempt to interfere with the running of
cars on the Clark avenue line so long
as there was police protection, but this
evening there was a determined effort to
get at the non-uniion men wlin were taken
to the barns this afternoon to operate
the cars from that end of the line. Soon
after dark a mob of SOno people assem
bled. There were twenty policemen at
the barns, but they were powerless to
handle the mob. Fences were torn down
and the crowd broke into the barns. In
the meantime the non-union men had es
caped to the attic and the rioters con
tented themselves with smashing a few
of the cars. By that time several wagon
loads of policemen had arrived and the
mob was dispersed.

their hearty welcome and then went on 10
say:
"The order of Elks has been more mis
understood, more censured and more ac
cused by those who do not know it than
has any other organization in existence. j
On the other hand, it has been more !
praised, more commended and more loved :
by these who do know it than any i
other organization. Many people have
thought that it was merely a convivial
organization with no serious objects or
purposes. This is a great mistake. The
ground work and foundation of the order i
is the great golden rule of life. 'Do unto
others as you would that they should do
unto you.' "

REVOLUTIONARY PLOTTERS
Friendly Dinner Given to Deroulede
to Hive the Motives of the
Castellanes.
NEW YORK. June 20.â A cable to the
Journal from Paris says: A revolution
ary gathering assembled to-night at
Count and Countess Boni Castellane'B.
The ostensible object was a friendly din
ner to Deroulede, who has just returned
from the country. All the Castellan?s,
old and young, are trying to get him to
corrupt the army against the republic at
the July 14 military review. President
Loubet will probably instruct the incom
ing Ministry to stop the annual review.
Count Castellane always leaves town
after the Grand Prix, but in order to
cover his schemes and the revolutionary
conspiracy, he has given out the Infor
mation that he will leave Paris in his
yacht for the north of Scotland on July
lfi. Anna Gould is paying the expenses
not only of her husband, but of all the
plotting Castellanes, including tho old
Countess.

Specta! Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Mont., June 20.â A special to
the Miner from Billings, Mont., says:
Word was received here last night that
! two desperate-looking characters answer
: ing the description of the two brothers
! advertised in the reward of $3000 each,
dead or alive, for the hold up and robbery
of the Union Pacific fast mail train near
Rock Creek. Wyo., recently, were in hid
' ing on a ranch about three or four miles
from Red Rock, in Beaver Head County.
Sheriff Pyle being away at the time, fÂ»-^
posse was at once organized by rii'l^l^
j Sheriff R. J. Moore to effect a capture. . V
! special train was made up and left here
lat 11 o'clock to take the posse to Red
j Rock, arriving there about midnight.
They at once started for the rendezvous,
'â  which was reached at about daylight.
The robbers were asleep, and on retir
. ing had taken their arsenal off. When
awakened they were gazing at the muz
zles of six or seven ugly-looking In
i chesters with resolute and cool men De
hind each of them. When called upon to
surrender they doggedly assented, as it
was impossible for them to do otherwise.
The robbers were on foot and had nÂ«
appearance of having had a hard time or
it as they looked to be completely worn
out and in a half-famished condition.
The posse with their prisoners arrived
at Red Rock about 6 o'clock this evening
and had to again 'resort to "special ser
j vice in order to get the prisoners to a
i place of safety, which they did about 11
1 o'clock to-night, landing them safely In
. the jail here, where they will be held to
, await further instructions and identifica
tion. . .
From all descriptions received up to
date Mr. Moore is confident he has tne
right parties and expects to come in for
a slice of the big reward offered for t.ie
; capture of the perpetrators of one of the
1 most daring and cleverly executed train
robberies of this time as well as one ot
â â  the best-paying jobs to the participants.
TRIAL OF MRS. STORKE
DRAWING TO A CLOSE
District Attorney Squire and Senator
Boyce Begin Arguments to
the , ury.
SANTA BARBARA. Junr> ZU.âArgu
ments in the Yda Addis Storke libel trial
began this afternoon. District Attorney
Squire in his closing address said all the
witnesses who appeared for the State had
testified to facts and their evidence had
not been shaken in the least by counsel
for the defendant. He declared the de
fense had tried to throw the r-rime upon
F. N. Gutierrez and Grant Jackson, whu,
he said, were dragged in to arouse a
doubt in the minds of the jurors as to
who the guilty person really was. He
spoke of the serious nature of the crime
and said the main object of the defendant
was to do all In her power to injure Dr.
Winchester.
Senator Boyce, for the defense, after re
viewing; the eviaenee of the State, told of
his honest belief in the Innocence of Mrs.
Storke. Turning to the testimony oi The
odore Kytka. the handwriting expert, Mr
Boyce attacked severely the admission of
such evidence. He drew a striking pic
ture of the present state of the French
republic, nearly rent by the Dreyfus scan
dal, telling that it was through the testi
mony of Government handwriting experts
that the crime was fastened upon the un
fortunate captain. He said the expert,
like the attorney, was hired to promote
a purpose, and for the same reason that
it is said the attorney for neither side
can be believed, so the testimony of the
expert should be suspected. The Senator
spoke from 2:40 until ."> o'clock, when
court adjourned until to-morrow.

MANY DRAWBACKS

CONDITIONS SEEM HOPELESS
SAD PICTURE OF TERRITORY
UNCLE SAM COVETS.
Lieutenant Hayne of the California
Heavy Artillei-y Sends a Re
markable Report to Agri
cultural Department.
Ppp'-inl Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
WASHINGTON, June 20. The Agricul
tural Department has received an inter
esting report from Lieutenant A. i.
Hayne, California Heavy Artillery, on ag
ricultun In the Philippines, dated Manila,
Lieutenant Hayne had been able to make
no personal observation beyond the Amer
ican lines, but he transmits the transla
tion of an article prepared for him by
Senor Manuel del Busto. chief of the ;.sri
cultural experiment station in Manila.
The most remarkable feature of the re
port is the almost hopeless picture paint
ed of the conditions prevailing in the
islands. The great fertility of the soil is
pointed out, and it is said that In only a
few restricted areas, where three crops
ear have been grathered without in
terruption for several centuries, is there
any apparent need of fertilizers. In spite
nf*this all attempts at colonization have
failed, either through the poor class of
immigrants Becured, the financial insta
bility of the various companies and the
corruption or oppression "f the Governors
and Government's agents. The result is
that the middle and lower classes In tae
Islands are almost of the worst possible
In addition to this primary difficulty in
securing reliable labor, the agriculturist is
confronted at the start with the necessity
fur an Immense amount of work in clear
ing new land. When this is accomplished
and a luxuriant crop raised it is at il-.e.
mercy of the first typhoon.
Besides the typhoon, there Is to be rear
ed In certain provinces the "dagudo" or
dry land wind, whicn dries up and de
stroys vegetati m. Diseases bo far hardly
known to European doctors result from
the turning up of this virgin soil. Accord
ing to competent medical authorities
many of these strand diseases rausp
death within a few hours, while from
others even if the paiient recovers, he is
Â,: Â1 to a wretched and lingering
experience.
\nother of the great difficulties in the
way of development is the utter lack of
roads and shipping points.
The native Filipino is unable to do any
large amount of work, and -ares to do
less He is indolent anil Riven to gamb
ling! All these vices have to be taken
into account in any undertaking whore
labor Is employed.
' The lack of credit Is another serious
handicap to enterprise. The minimum
cost of m'.ney in the Philippines, regard
| ess Âf security. Is 12 per cent. At present
the Philippines are cursed by a well or
ganized body of the worst sort of
\i surist s
â llv price of nearly all <- r ops Is steadily
falling, as the production retrogrades in
quality and quantity.
Lieutenant Hayne in transmitting this
document states' that he would Strongly
recommend special quarantine measures
against Philippine plant?, as there exist
an immense number of vptv injurious
parasites in the Island, and many private
parties are already preparing to import
botanical specimens.

"Death to Traitors" the Warning
Contained in a Note Left

SrÂ»vMal I>lf=patrh to Thp Call.
WICHITA. Kans. June 20.â Because he
! threatened to betray secrets of vital in-
I terest, William Tackett was assassinated
! by members of the Algood outlaw gang
i some time last week. His body was found
I last night in a strawstack rive miles south
'of this town. Tackett had seven gunshot
wounds in his back. A note, signed "Al- j
good Gang," -was found in Tacketfs |
pocket. It read:
"Beware of any one who wants to con
fess. Death to Traitors."
The confession of Tackett. which he had
already sent to Sheriff .Simons, says in
; part: ,â¢ Â«
"For the clemency you have offered me
; I will say I know' who are the real mur
i derers of Joe New in Greenwood County
|In 1597. They were Frank Algood, Al
I Ballard and Bill Turner. ' Mrs. New and
i Joe Dobbs, who were convicted of the j
I murder, are innocent."
Al Ballard who was mentioned, has al- I
i ready confessed and is in the penitentiary.
i Frank Algood is also behind prison bars.
; Turner was seen with Tackett last Mon
! day near the place where the latter's
body was found. The note found on Tack
-1 ett has been identified as being in Turn
er's handwriting. â ;.â 'â¢â â '
A peculiar feature in connection with the
i assassination of Tackett is that he was
aided to escape from prison by the Algood
prang in order that they might carry out
their plans. Tackett escaped from the
i County Jail in January. While he was in
! Jail he gave out word that he intended to
'â  confess. The Algood gang heard of it. and
in a few days Tackett received aid from
outsiders, who helped him escape. Since
: then he has been in hiding, but recently
, he sent word to the authorities that he
desired to tell about Joe New's real mur
-1 derers. They offered him clemency, and
i he sent his confession ahead by courier.
i While riding to town he was met rind
! murdered by Turner. The courier came
on and delivered the message.

Mail Boxes.
There has been considerable talk of put
ting mall boxes on the street cars in Chi
cago, and the Postoffice Department is
now investigating the workings of this
system in tho few cities where it has been
1 tried. Colonel Edens, who is Superln
! tondent of the Western Free Delivery
â  Service, Is now looking into the matttor.
The system has been in operation for
some time in Dos Moines. lowa, and is
said to be quite, popular there. It was
inaugurated by the Postmaster of that
place, hf having been formerly a railroad
man. whence he derived the Idea. The
1 belt line cars connecting Minneapolis and
St. Paul also carry mail boxes. The ad
vantage of the system is obvious. As
soon as a letter is dropped in the box it
starts on its way. There is no waiting
for collection. In contemplating the. ex
tension of. the service, however, the de
: partment is confronted with a consid
erable prejudice among the street railroad
; employes and the labor unions against
making every street car a Government
mall conveyance. Vlterior motives are
1 always suspected. The workmen see an
1 effort to use the Government to prevent
j a tie up of the road In case of a strike.
And it may bo mentioned incidentally
that in the case of the strike at Mlnne
apolis and St. Paul the belt line carry
i ing the boxes was the only one which con
tinued to run. The companies, however,
do not seem to regard the boxes as an un
mixed benefit, for. while they were at
first willing in most cases to carry them
for nothing, they now demand cotnpensa
i tion. -Chicago Jnurnah
Crime in Germany.
The latest quarterly report of the Ger
man Imperial Statistical Department con
tains most important information which
throws an unpleasant light on the fre
quency of crime within the empire.
Details are given of the number of con
victions in each year since 18S2. when the
present system of registration, began. In
1882 the number of convicted persons was
329,899, or 1040 convictions for every 100,
--000 of the population. Since then the
number and proportion have steadily in
creased until the latest figures are 447.
--975 convictions, equal to 1220 per 100,000.
Crimes and offenses against the person
show a striking increase.
On the other hand, the number of con
victions for crimes against property,
theft, concealing stolen property, etc.,
have largely diminished.â London Chroni

Up On the Statutes.
Cincinnati people love to tell this story
on General Benjamin F. Butler: ire was
one of a commission to examine young
applicants for admission to the bar, anil
before- him came a youth who failed mis
erably on all that pertained to jurispru
dence case law. civil law, sumptuary law.
unwritten law and due process of law.
Finally Butler, who rather liked the chap,
and wanted to see him through, asked:
"What would you like to be examined in?
You have failed in everything we have
suggested." The reply came: "Try me
on the statutes: I'm up on them." Rutkr

friend," he said. "I'm afraid you won't do.
You may be ever so familiar with the
statutes, but what is to prevent a fool

Fences.

PI,ACKRVII,I.E. Juno 20.â The thirty
fifth animal session of the Grand Grove
of tho I'nitod Ancient Order of Druids
convened in tho Masonic Temple in this
city at 11 o'clock this morning. There
was a large attendance of delegates from
the subordinate groves throughout the
Btate. After tho reading and approval
of the minutes of the last Grand Grove,
Noble Grand Arch Frank Lewis addressed
the Grand Grove on the work hefore it.
"This reunion." said the noble grand
arch, "signifies that another year da to be
recorded in the history of our beloved
order, and we are assembled in thirty
fifth annual session in the pla^e Druidism
was first planted west of the Rocky
Mountains. 1 trust that the deliberations
of this Grand (Grove will prove successful
and n 'ir sojourn in Placerville a con
tinued round of pleasure. One year ago
you conferred upon me the highest honor
within your gift, hy placing in my hand
the gavel of the Grand Grove. I have
endeavored to show by my actions that
I fully appreciated the marked honor and
to Rive you no cause for regret."
After the formal opening the reports of
officers were read. They showed a
healthy condition of finance and mem
bership. The reports <f the grand officers
were referred to the committee on distri
bution. The report of Grand Secretary
John M. Graves showed there are now
seventy-one subordinate groves within
the jurisdiction of ihe Grand Grove of
Californiaâ sixty-nine in this State and
two in the State of Washington. There
has been an increase of lSt> members to
the order since the session of the last
Grand Grove. Twenty-six thousand me
hundred and thirty-three dollars have
been disbursed in sick benefits during the
past year.
Resolutions were introduced amending
article JI. section ?>. and article IV
of the constitution of the grand organiza
tion The proposed amendments have
been made the special order for to-mor
row's session.
The Grand Grove and Past Arch de
grees were conferred upon thirty-five
members.
The report of the committee on legisla
tion recommending that the workings of
the 'subordinate groves be changed from
the first to the third degree, provoked an
interesting._and animated discussion, par
ticipated in by Past Noble Grand Arch
Cavagnaro. James A. Devoto and H. G.
Goller in favor of the recommendation
and L. G. Schard and J. Michell against
the innovation. The recommendation was
adopted. m 'm~*
Charters were ordered issued to four new
groves. The Grand Grove adjourned at 5
o'clock p. m. to 10 a. m. to-morrow.
To-nlgnt an open-air concert was given
on the plaza and the visitors were enter
tained by members of the local groves.
THE EMPORIUM.
To-morrow after the session of the Grand
Grove the visitors will be shown somg of
the principal mines near the' city. To
morrow night they will be entertained at
a ball at the opera house and a banquet at
Confidence pavilion.
The chief interest of the session centers
in the election. The principal contest ap
pears to be over the deputy grand arch
ship. There are a number of candidates,
the most prominent of whom are Dr.
O'Donnell. J. Hagan. H. Lang. L. G.
Schard and Jules S. Oodeau. Each has
a considerable following and the outcome
is looked forward to with interest.
BLUE ROSES AT LAST
But What Is the Good of Them, Asks
an .Unimpressionable Editor.
If we may trust tho story forwarded by
our Vienna correspondent to-day, a rtow
er in the charming valley of Kezanllk ha*
I attained the summit >f floricultural ambi
j tion. He has produced a blue rose. If. in
! the Middle Ages, some one had announced
his veritable discovery of the phil
osopher's stone, history would furnish us
with a parallel to the flutter which the
news of this marvel is likely to send
through the botanical world. At lust the
feat which generations of nurserymen
have been patiently laboring at has been
performed. If the rose has been forced to
adopt an azure tint, hardly anything in
the way of transformation need be con
sidered unattainable. It is predicted that
, the novel bloom will soon be abundant in
: the market. And then? Well. then, we
! suppose, we shall have erased to wonder;
shall take cerulean petals as a common-
I place thing, and. perhaps, if we are wise
and frank, confess that we very much
prefer the old-fashioned red or white or
yellow. Cultivation, beyond all contro
versy, has added immensely to the wealth
jof our gardens and greenhouses. Species
j that are poor and limited in range have
I been developed into an infinite variety of
exquisite or imposing forms. No one.
however obstinately he may be devoted
to simplicity and primitlveness, will ven
ture to deny the debt he owes, not only
to the collector, but to the grower of or
chids. So we may go through the ever
lengthening list of beautiful plants, and at
| each stage reflect how much sincere de
j light we should miss if the experts had
I been less keen about cross-fertilization,
I change of soil and water and all the other
devices by which thÂ» parent stock has
been converted into a multitude of well
nigh unrecognizable descendants. But,
while it would be affectation to regret the
spirit of competition and the straining for
mere variation would have resulted in
such additions to our floral wealth, it
must be acknowledge .l also that pome of
the products of the experimental florist
have nothing to recommend them except
the extreme difficulty of bringing about
the change. Neither men nor nightin
gales will ever worship a blue rose, and.
once it become easy to multiply them,
they will be treated with as small respect
as a pink hyacinth. Still, a period of
fashionable triumph may be predicted for
the strange blossofVi, during which speci
mens will cause blocks in the moving
crowd to flo%ver shows, and be voted
"curious" and even "pretty" by amateurs.
Love of change is one of the fundamental
impulses of the average human being, and
it has played more than the customary
part in determining the mutations of
flower worship. Just now there is an ex
traordinary craze tor reducing arum
lilies to the dimensions of a crocus; but
when the limits of dwarfing are reached
there may be a reaction in favor of grow
ing the plant to the nize of a palm tree.
At each stage of metamorphosis there will
be admirers, andâ what is more to the
purpose of the professionalsâ a fair num
ber of purchasers. Things run through
the whole gamut of change; but nature is
avenged at last, and the last wave of the
hybridiser's wand will restore the object
of his thaumaturgy to the simple original
form. A future generation may yet hail-

After they hail discussed the sipirt and

MISCHIEVOUS MONKEYS.
A Musical Party of Simians in Dan
Rice's Menagerie.
"It may surprise many persons to learn
that monkeys, ,if.spite their cleverness,
are not enduringly susceptible n the in
fluences of 'higher-education,' for infinite
is their innate depravity. I found them
ready enough to learn, but persistent in
refusal to display their knowledge whÂ»n
required to da so by their patient teacher.
This peculiar side of monkey nature was
forcibly impressed <>n me when I tried to
form an orchestra, or string hand, among
; the simians of my menagerie," says Dan
i Rice.
"We were in winter quarters, and. as it
was my custom to devote my spare rime
during the cold term to taming and train
ing wild animals for the next season. I
i had a family "f monkeys confined in an
I apartment adjoining my reading, am >kin>;
and music room.
"One morning upon nearing the cottage
my ears were greeted by the sound of my
cello. I paused, wondering what visitor
had provoked my rich-toned Instrument
to such unseemly discord. Then l ap
proached closely, and through a window
saw a laughable scene.
"Seated upon a chair, with a smoking
cap on his head, spectacles mi his nope,
! and meerschaum pipe in his mouth, was
I Joe. the largest monkey in the menagerie,
' sawing away at the cello with bow in
hand. Several of the smaller monkeys
were in postures of surprise and delight
at Joe's performance. T had omitted to
lock the door of the monkey room, and
that accounted for the intrusion on my
sanctum.
"Highly entertained. I stood for a time
a silent spectator, until seen by a little
monkey, who notified its fellows of niy
presence with a sharp cry. In a twinkling
the animals dashed from the room. Joe,
minus cap. spectacles and pipe, bringing
up the rear and carefully closing the door
behind him. Upon entering the house I
found all the monkeys safely ensconced
in their proper room and looking as inno
cent as possible, while the old ringleader
was snoring and apparently sound asleep.
From this occurrence the idea of trying
to form an orchestra of monkeys came
into my head, for I well knew that such
a troupe, even if it produced anything
but melody, would be a strong attrac
tion."âYouth's Companion.
A Wopsle in Real Life.
The mills of the ecclesiastical courts
may grind slowly, but that they grind ex
ceeding small has just been demonstraied
by the Archdeacon of Sanim. He held a
solemn inquiry into the following porten
tous charges against the Parish Clerk of
Coombe Bassett: d> That he read the re
sponses in a loud voice while the choir
was chanting them; C2> that he disoheyefl
a command of the incumbent by refusing
to fetch water to cleanse the communion
vessels: <3> that he mulea noise fiy shovi l
ing fuel into the stove whilst the clergy
man was in the act of drinking from the
chalice: and (4) that he remonstrated witli
the reverend gentleman ab.out his ser
mons. It would seem that the Parish
Clerk of Coombe Bassett. even as iJick
ens' Mr. Wopsle. has a high sense of his
own importance. He did not approve of
t ho way In which the services were con
ducted, and so (like Wopsle) he "pun
ished the Amens tremenodusly."' stoked
up the fire by way of protest against
"Popish nonsense." and advised the in
cumbent "not to preach about baptismal
regeneration." The j-rchdeacon has ad
monished the clerk no; t<"> do these things
again, and thus at a critical moment the
cause of law and order in the church has
been majestically vindicated.â London

THE STORIES OF THE YUKON
' \ LL that romance ever dreamed of desperate ad
\ enture in pursuit of golden treasure is em
-1 * bodied in tl the early reports bring
experiences of the Yukon adventurers dur
â¢ winter. Hardly any conceivable event
ortune or misfortune is missing from the record.
Everything is there, from the rapture of rich strikes
gru< - :. c horror of cannibalism.
It l- surely a strange life that civilized men have
in that Arctic winter. One report tells how
: - when digging a hole in the frozen
â  t a tent pole found great chunks of
virgii ime of the nuggets being as much as
inches square. Another tells how three men
searching for gold lost their way, exhausted their sup
and perished. When the bodies were found it
â  : with dread suspicion that the flesh of one
of them had been cut away as if to furnish food for
men made ravenous and mad by famine and cold.
There are stories of rich strikes along various
idy known to be rich, of other discoveries
ers on newly explored creeks and
and then stories of bodies found exposed
by the melting snow, with wounds that signify mur
der. There arc tales of the founding of promising
mining camps and predictions that they may grow
to be cities, and another tale of a frantic fight inter
rupting a night of revelry and resulting in the out
of a tire that nearly swept the metropolis of the
Klondike from the face of the earth.
A true and comprehensive narrative of the winter
;â¢.'<. im the Yukon if told by a man who possesses
ing ni the graphic realism of Defoe would
make tin- most thrilling, blood-curdling romance of
the epoch. It is us* less for writers to go back to the
ruddle age- \<< search for stirring themes. No age
has ever furnished a wider display of every faculty
of man from the hi^hc^t courage to the most de
spairing cowardice than has the Klondike country
the gold ru>h began, nor has any land set that
n a more imprc-=ive stage or with a more
ous background than that furnished by the
Alaskan wilderness with its winter of ice and dark
lumined with auroral lights, charming the soul
by the glory of its heavens and torturing the body
by the rigors of its cold.
It may be accepted as certain that Alaska and the
Canadian Northwest Territory are to have a con
tinuous development in civilization. Gold has been
found in such quantities as will induce men of capital
to expend money, skill and energy in searching out
and exploiting the quartz rocks from which the gold
has been ground out by glaciers and washed down
by the spring torrents to the placers. That the
wealth expended in obtaining the gold will exceed
;,ll that can be taken out may be accepted as a matter
of course. That fact will not deter the sanguine. Each
will believe himself destined to be the lucky one who
will succeed where the others fail. The Arctic gold
fields will therefore be fully developed, and with the
progress of the development there will come a safer
life for those engaged in promoting it. We are get
ting the worst of Alaska now, and those daring and
adventurous men and women who have gone through
it all will have good reason to recall it and boast of it
in future years.
It is evident that no Filipino is whipped until he
has been killed. Driving him from the field does'not
count, as running away and coming back again as
soon as our troops move on are parts of his war
tactics that he most delights in.
Tt is not strange, no matter how it may appear, that
a man in Ohio stricken dumb fifteen years ago has re
covered the power of speech. Numerous politicians
are likely to find tongue as miraculously once Mark
H anna is safe in Europe.
Britishers are just arriving at the conclusion that
"' >om" Paul is getting ugly. Is it possible that there
has never been a shipment of the Boer President's
photos to England?
Murderer Moore of Nevada City has occasional
sleeping spells at his trial. It may not be long before
his sleep becomes permanent.
That old phrase, "Our friends, the enemy," is be
ing sharply illustrated by the treacherous "amigos"
in the Philippines.
THE PHILIPPINE SITUATION.
THE undeclared war in the Philippines has now
been on nearly twice as long as the time that
passed between our ultimatum to Spain and the
call of Cambon in behalf of the Spanish Government
to ask for a peace parley. The Filipinos, without ef
fective artillery and lacking military formation, have
proved their touch and common feeling with all peo
ple who are fighting for the soil they were born on
and for independence and self-government against an
invading host. The Greeks did it at Marathon, the
Romans at Metaurus, the Germans in Teutoburgher
Wald. the Relgians at the battle of the Golden Spur.
We did it through the eight years of our Revolution.
and when a British army invaded our country in the
war in.1812. and after the battle of Bladensburg put
the torch to Washington City, burned the Capitol and
White House and put the Government to flight, a
thorn was planted in the American heart that rankled
until now that British flattery has drawn it.
In estimating the difficulties that our brave troops
have faced in that wet and poisonous archipelago it
must not be forgotten that our superior arms, aim
and formations, our great guns and the support of
warships that with one broadside can destroy a town
and leave its men, women and children heaped in a
mass of torn flesh to spume in ths sun. all have been
nearly equalized by the horrible climate, the vertical
sun, the noxious evaporation.
To all these the natives are as accustomed as a toad
to the vapors of a fen, therefore, though the sym
pathy of the nations is forbidden them and the Gov
ernments that have cursed the world with war and con
quest and wetted it with the tears of the weak and the
blood of the brave are leading us in their footsteps
and out of the ways of our own fathers, nature fights
as an ally of the Filipinos. With less resources and not
a ship they have proved themselves far superior to
the Spaniards as fighters, and to overcome them is an
achievement that will merit brighter laurels and
greater honors than are due the soldiers who touched
the tottering power of Spain and saw it fall.
The French and English, especially the latter, in
structed our Government that the Filipinos were not
to be treated as human beings, but that they must be
pursued like beasts of prey until the remnant that
survived would submit, abandon a dream of freedom,
cease to aspire to independence, and bend the neck
to whatever yoke we fashion.
The advice has been followed, and that has been
followed by consequences that might have been ex
pected. Our inadequate force has destroyed the
country by raiding, the natives have fought as they
retreated and their hosts have closed in behind our
advancing columns, as water closes after the hand
that is drawn through it. The women and old men
have come out of the jungle and sat in the ashes of
their poor huts and have felt just as Greek. Persian.
Roman, German and American have felt in the pres
ence of the invader.
Meantime General Otis has been dealing "crush
ing blows." He has ended the "rebellion" repeat
edly. There h.i> been frequent joy in the Cabinet that
the business was over and we could settle down to
the profits of conquest and teach the natives that it
is their Christian duty to love their enemies and wait
for them to fall upon our necks. But the "crushing
blows" do not crush. We have probably killed thou
sands of these people who never heard of us until we
invaded their country with the flag of the free. There
i> much mourning in American homes. The first
born of many a house has died under a blistering,
tropical sun. a hero, because his country ordered it.
Our troops have pushed the unavailing butchery of
war with uncomplaining endurance and dash. Yet
the barefooted enemy, remembering his hut burned
and his paddy field destroyed, lurks in the jungle and
fights.
It is time to do one thing or the other. Either send
ioo.ooo men at once and besom the islands bare of
human life, or do what was easy five months ago â
treat them as human beings, cease the reiteration of
"unconditional surrender" to a people who know that
we are already disarming Cuba, and see whether the
orders we have taken from Great Britain to never
treat the Filipinos as human are correct or not. The
latter course will not be pursued. Then the former
must be. The troops must be raised and sent. If they
will not volunteer they must be conscripted. The
rnnks must be filled by force if need be, and we must
push our conquest as all conquerors have to. It is
evident that we must reduce the archipelago to com
plete desolation, and leave only the inferior manhood
living that is found among the tribes that are too
cowardly to fight.
The Chicago Journal and other leading Republican
papers join The Call hi this demand as supporters of
the administration. As Otis must be fatigued with
punching the bag. let him be rested and send another
commander in chief. War is hell. We have made a
hell in the Philippines: let us get through with it as
soon as possible.
A HOME VIEW OF GORMAN.
ONE of the most notable features of national
Democratic politics of late is the sudden rise
of Gorman from the retirement enforced upon
him by his defeat for re-election to the Senate to a po
sition of seemingly greater power than ever in the
party. The discredited leader who could not obtain
a Senatorship from his own little State now stands
forth as a personage of such importance that he is
looked upon as a dangerous rival to Bryan and as
a probable candidate for the Presidency next year.
The unexpected appearance this astute and
forceful leader in the thick of the confusion of the
Democratic camp, and the activity of his efforts to
form a faction of his own among the discordant hosts,
have naturally given rise to a great deal of comment.
In those Statrs where the gold element prevails, and
to a consideotible extent in the South. Gorman's can
didacy has been received with maiked favor, and has
been given something of a boom.
The declarations in support of the ex-Senator have
been confined by no means to irresponsible parties.
Several men known to have weight and influence in
the councils of Tammany have been outspoken in ad
vocating his nomination, and it can hardly be doubted
that' powerful organization is at his back. In other
States also men of great influence among conserva
tive Democrats have been equally vigorous in up
holding his candidacy, so that he now appears as the
man who is most likely to be chosen to lead the op
position to Bryan when the Democrats assemble fo
select their standard bearer for the campaign of 1900.
Under these circumstances it is interesting to note
that in his own home there is by no means so enthu
siastic a support as elsewhere. The Baltimore Ameri
can, while a stalwart Democratic paper, is known to
be opposed to the boss-ship of Gorman, and allowance
will be made for its opposition now. Nevertheless it
has the advantage of a proximity to Gorman which
other papers do not possess, and therefore can ap
praise the elements of his strength and his weakness
better than any other. It sees him from the stand
point of an intimate enemy as it were, and thnt is by
no means the worst point of view from which to get
a true idea of such a man as he is.
The American insists that Gorman's nomination
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEdJeSPAY, JUNE 21, 1899.
would involve a political absurdity, inasmuch as he
has been faithful to neither wing of the party. He
opposed the Cleveland administration and was the
leader in the Senate who defeated the Wilson tariff by
so amending it as to virtually destroy it. He is a gold
money man, who supported Bryan in 1896, but sup
ported him in such a way that it did Bryan no good.
He is therefore distrusted by the gold men, the silver
men and the free traders: and for that reason the
American holds that despite all that may be done for
him by Tammany and other political machines, he
will not be able to command strength enough in the
national convention to obtain the nomination.
The American takes another view of his activity at
this time. It says: "Mr. Gorman merits the reputa
tion he has acquired as an astute politician, ami it
seems clear that he is playing national politics. He
knows that the nomination of Bryan will mean that
the party will be led through a slaughter-house to an
open grave: that the party's salvation depends upon
the nomination of one who can satisfy the ultra
rndica-1 Democrats as well as those who bolted Bryan
in 1806. no matter what the platform he is run on.
Mr. Gorman knows that he is not that man, because
he could not hold the ultra-radicals. But in his mind
Bryan must go down. Since he cannot, therefore, be
the Edward of Democracy, the next best thing is to
be its Warwick, and it's Warwick's role Arthur Pue
Gorman is playing these days."
OUR VANISHING FORESTS.
WII. MILLS has returned from rib trip
through Northern California and Oregon,
â¢ bringing another warning of the rapid de
struction of our forests. During his trip he has had
occasion to note with more than ordinary care the
woods of the country along his route, and he reports
that where a few years ago there were vast stretches
i of unbroken forests there is now nothing but bare
hills and blackened stumps.
While the destruction of the kind referred to by
Mr. Mills is not as bad as that caused by forest fires,
it is none the less sufficiently extensive and wasteful
to demonstrate the need of a better supervision and
protection of our woodland wealth. In one place
five sawmills were noted, which cleared over 200
acres a week. The mills of course do not use any but
trees that furnish merchantable timber, and yet the
process of the industry is such that it completely de
vastates the forests, or so nearly so that it requires
about 4000 acres of the land cut over to furnish the
fuel required annually for the locomotives of the rail
road passing through the district.
In commenting upon the subject Mr. Mills said:
"There should be no timber cut without the super
vision of the forest wardens. They should mark the
trees to be felled and no others should be taken. As it
is now all the best trees are selected by the millmen,
and in getting these out they destroy not only all the
other old trees but the young ones as well. The clear
ing of the forests is also affecting the water supply.
If they go on as they have been going it will not be
lung before the Sacramento River will be nothing but
a small stream. In these vast extents of cleared land-,
where when the trees stood you could not go any
distance without crossing a stream, there is now not
even a spring; the hills are drying up. When the
rain falls it runs off the slopes as it does off the roof
of a house; the streams rise and run like torrents,
and then dry up again as soon as the rain is over.
Snow melts as quickly as it falls almost, and the land
dries before spring is past.
The problem involved in the destruction of our
forests is one that never can be too often discussed
or too often brought to the attention of thoughtful
men. It is one of far-reaching importance, and pro
foundly affects the welfare of the State. It must be
borne in mind that beyond the mountains that shut
the Pacific Coast States from the interior there
stretches a vasty region of almost treeless and tim
berles? country. As that region settles up the inhab
itants will look to the coast States for their supply
of lumber for all purposes. The drain upon our fnr
e>ts. already large, will therefore increase with the
years, and the evil become at last one whose menace
cannot be mistaken by even the most thoughtless.
The great progressive States of the East have
begun to take steps not only to protect such forests
as remain to them, but to replant many districts which
have been stripped of their trees. The example of
<uch States will of course have its effect sooner or
later, and we shall in the end follow them in their
wise course. It would be better, however, if we should
join them in taking the leadership in the matter and
set an example to other Pacific Coast States. One
thing may be regarded as certain â if we would pre
serve California for future greatness we must preserve
her forests from present destruction.
BY way of complying with the requests that have
been made by its readers for the publication in
book form of the many striking cartoons that
have marked its pages of late, the Los Angeles
Times has issued in ;i very attractive form a volume
containing them, the object being partly to preserve
the cartoons and partly to provide a valuable and in
teresting premium to its subscribers.
The cartoons are by the gifted Will E. Chapin, one
of the most versatile satiric artists of the time, and
cover the very interesting period of the war with
Spain and the recent political contest that ended in
the election of Governor Gage. It has, therefore, a
historic as well as an artistic value, and may be ac
counted a notable contribution to the political history
of the time.
The subscribers of the Times are to be congratu
lated on the opportunity for obtaining so attractive a
souvenir ol American public opinion during the
Spanish war, and such, witty illustrations of the folly
of the fusion campaign of last year. Mr. Chapin is
also to be congratulated on the excellence of his work
3nd the appreciative way in which it has been pre
sented to the public by L. E. Mosher, who contri
butes the introduction to the volume.
It is now said the deflates at the Peace Confer
ence are waiting for Kaiser William to make up his
mind whether he will consent to agree to arbitration
or not before they go further in any part of their
work except that of dining with the notabilities of
The Hague and drawing their salaries. It seems to
be a situation in which they can wait as long as the
Kaiser and will not hurry him, but it is hard on the
taxpayers of nations that have to pay the salaries, and
harder still on the aristocrats of The Hague who have
to put up for the dinners.
Imperialism brings militarism, and military govern
ment brings the sort of thing now going on at Ward
ner. Is it any wonder the people have taken a sec
ond thought on the subject of foreign conquests and
are more resolved to preserve their own liberties than
to suppress that of the Filipinos?
A few people are reported to be on their way from
the Klondike with gold, but the great majority of
those who joined the rush to the diggings are still
digging away with no gold in sight.
CHAPIN'S CARTOONS.
MAYOR R. W. SNOW PLEDGES OAKLAND'S
SUPPORT TO THE DEWEY MONUMENT
Counts It a Privilege to Aid the
Committee.
h A AYOR PHELAX, thft chairman, and Captain
l\/l Fletcher, the secretary, of the Dewey monument
I V I committee some days ago sent communications to
I I the Mayors of twenty of the principal cities in the
I I State, petting- forth tho purposes of the committee,
â  I the debt of gratitude the people of the Pacific Coast
owe to Admiral Dewey and the officers and men under him
for Paving these shores from the guns of a hostile fleet,
appealing to the patriotism of the people of California and
calling upon the Mayors of their respective cities to give
the movement every assistance in their power. It was ex
plained that although the monument was to be located in
Ran Francisco, it being the chief seaport of the coast, it
was the intention to have it the offering of the whole State
to the great admiral and his subordinates.
With a view to ascertaining the sentiment in the inte
rior regarding the movement. The Call has had the gentle
men addressed prepare a statement of their views, and
these are daily being received. From them it will be seen
that the plan to honor Dewey and his officers and men with
a magnificent monument meets with as great, favor
throughout the interior as it has in San Francisco. The men
appealed to will give it their heartiest support, and in a
short time funds from north and south and east will be
pouring in to swell the splendid contributions already
made by the local patriots. .Following is the statement of
R. W. Snow of Oakland, who upon. receipt of the commit
tee's letter made a special trip across the bay to confer
with Mayor Phelan on the subject*
OAKLAND, June 20.
Editor San Francisco Call â Sir: I count it a privilege to aid the Citizens' Committee to erect a monu
ment to the American navy, and in commemoration of Admiral Dewey's victory at Manila Bay. The generous
subscriptions of Mr. Spreckels. Mayor Phelan and others are a guarantee of the success of the undertaking. A
subscription list is now open in the Mayor's office in this city. The money our citizens will give will by no
means measure their admiration for the great admiral, or the man behind the gun, but I am confident that
they desire to help build this monument. Let it suggest the majestic power of the American people. Let it
be as broad and as high and as permanent as the principle for which the war was waged. Other generations will
take their children into the shadow of it and teach them to be also ready to do great deeds when their jcoun
try answers again to the call of humanity. R. W. SNOW.
SURGEON WARE
VICTIM OF AN
HALLUCINATION
His Malady the Result
of Using a Drug.
IT MAY AFFECT NEALL CASE
COL. FARWOOD SAYS THE SUR
GEON WAS COMPETENT.
â â _
Captain Neall's Friends Think Differ
ently and Declare Dr. Ware
Should Not Have Been
on the Court.
The case of Captain Tsaac P. Ware, as
sistant surgeon. United States army, is
i causing much sympathetic comment In
army circles. Dr. Ware If highly spoken
of as a surgeon of superior ability, whose
record for industry and investigation is
' excellent. When the Government began
| to make active preparations for the Span
| ish war the work of army doctors was
: greatly increased. At that time Dr. Ware
i was suffering intensely from a physical
1 ailment, and In order to obtain relief from
j pain to enable him to perform the many
duties assigned to him he resorted to nar
; cotics. It is naid that his case would not
| have reached a dangerous condition if he
had sought the advice of another physi
cian instead of prescribing for himself.
Army officers do not care to discuss the
health of Dr. Ware, but the admission is
made that lie manifests signs of physical
and mental breakdown. Major Robert J.
("ril'sun. surgeon; Captain Edward Everts,
assistant surgeon, and Captain Thomas I.
1 Raymond, assistant Burgeon, wen ap
â  pointed as a board of officers to inquire
concerning the mental and physical health
of Dr. Ware. When an officer is thought
to be disabled physically the judgment of
one doctor is oegarded as sufficient to
determine the nature and extent of the
disability. When indications point to
trouble in the mind the opinion of three
physicians is required. A prominent
officer remarked yesterday:
"Dr. Ware is an able man, and I have
no doubt that he could to-day pass an
examination readily and answer all ques
tions without faltering; but he has suf
fered intensely, and as the result of ap
plying narcotics to gain relief has gone
too far."
Dr. Ware is a native of Maine and was
appointed to the army from that State in
1592. He was ordered to the Presidio
about a year ago from Los Angeles,
whither he had gone on sick leave from
the Department of California. When he
came here his unfortunate failing was
known, and his brother officers kept a
close watch over him and did everything
in their power to prevent his using the
drug to which he was addicted. When
under its influence his hallucination was
as sad as it was humiliating. On all other
subjects Dr. Ware wa,s apparently per
fectly rational. He endeared himself to
all with whom he came in contact. Some
time ago when a suspected case of small
pox was quarantined on the Reservation,
Dr. Ware was the surgeon put in charge
of the case.
When the quarantine was declared off
and he was relieved and returned to the
post one of his superiors was shocked to
discover that the young surgeon's mental
condition was such that it was evident he
had been freely using the narcotic during
the quarantine. The facts were reported?
and Colonel Farwood. the chief surgeon
of the department, ordered the necessary
board to examine Dr. Ware. This the
board did on Monday, and while its re
port has not been made public, there is
hardly any doubt but that Dr. Ware will
be ordered before a Retiring Board, al
though it Is possible the board may rec
ommend that he be sent to some place for
treatment.
There is one fact in connection with the
unfortunate case that is of material in
terest. Dr. Ware was a member of the
court-martial that tried Captain Neall.
During the trial there was much joking at
Dr. Ware's expense because he was un
able, to keep awake. It has been rumored
that at the time of the trial Dr. Ware
was freely using some drug, and that he
was in no mental condition to administer
justice.
Colonel Farwood declares that Dr.
Ware was mentally fit at that time to sit
upon the court, while Captain Neall's
friends firmly assert that he was not. It
is a fact that Dr. Ware fell asleep during
many sittings of the court.
Officers who are posted on military law
say that Captain Neall can not have a
new trial, but it is not denied that the
very fact of Dr. Ware's being mentally
afflicted and that he was a member of the
court that convicted Captain Neall may
have great effect with the President, in
whose hands the fate of the cavalry offi
cer now rests. At present Dr. Âare is
confined to his quarters.

is ridiculously small, amounting to about

the insanity of Mr. Wakelee is being re
vived by his friends. He is well to no

about a year ago and lately thÂ« cancer he

ARIZONA AND NEW MEXlCOâSub

at tempts have been made to have these
Territories admitted to statehood, but
none proved successful.
QUEEN VICTORIAâ A. A. W., City.
Royal families drop their family names
and cannot, in reality, be said to have
any. Queen Victoria belongs to a Han
over family, and her name, if she can be
said to have any aside from her title, is
Oiu-lph or Welf. Princes of the royal
blood are christened and married by their
titles only and their family names be
come by intermarriage extinct. The
family name of the House of Saxony, of
which Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, who
married Victoria, descended, is Wettins,
or in German, Wettiner. So. to come
down to the common pla.ne, the name of
Queen Victoria is Victoria Guelph-Wet
tins.
BORN ON A SHIPâ W. 0., City. If an
English married couple sails from England
on an English vessel and as that vessel
was entering the Golden Gate of San
Francisco a boy was born to that couple,
the boy was a native of California and
consequently an American. At that time
the vessel was no longer on the high seas
but in American waters. Had the boy
been born while the vessel was still on
the high seas he would have been a na
tive nf England. The other part of the
question asked: "If that boy was taken
back to England and grew up there, could
he claim American citizenship, or would
he be a British subject?" Is one the an
swer to which shows the difference be
tween nationality and citizenship. The
boy, being an American by birth, could,
on* attaining his majority, elect which
country he wished to be a citizen of, and
makes"that election by. say If in England,
refusing to perform the duties of a citizen
of that country; or If in the United States,
assuming the duties of citizenship, or vice
versa. â  -

NATIONAL BANK STOCK.
i Its Liability to Taxation to Be
Legally Determined.
City and County Attorney Lane has ad
vised* Tax Collector Sheehan to accept the
taxes due on the real estate of the
Crocker- "U'oolworth National Bank at this
time without requiring the payment of
personal property taxes. He bases his
opinion on a recent decision by United
States District Judge de Haven, and con
cludes with the statement that It has been
held by both the Federal and State
court's "that the personal property of a
national bank cannot be directly as
sessed for taxation by State authorities.
" The opinion was called for in view of
Assessor Dodge's action in assessing the
chares of the five national banks In this
city owned by stockholders. This stock
has heretofore escaped taxation alto
ec-ther and the Assessor contends that it
is nrlvate property And therefore subject
to taxation the same as any other per
sonal'property. By his action $5,000,000 Is
added to the assessment roll.
It is stated that the Crocker-Woolworth
Bank, through its attorneys Lloyd Â«c
Wood will sue out an Injunction to-day
restraining the Assessor from assessing
Its stock and thus throw the matter Into
the courts.

THE CITY TO
MANUFACTURE
ITS HYDRANTS
Bids Found to Be Far
Too High.
CHIEF SULLIVAN'S STATEMENT
â¦
AMPLE FACILITIES FOR CASTING
AND FINISHING.
Less Than SSOO Necessary to Fully
Equip the Corporation Yard for
the Undertaking â A Big
Saving.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors at its meeting yesterday
'. what the members considT^d
another attempt on the part of certain
firms to ent<--r Into a combine for the pur
pose of mulcting the city, and the result
is that the fat contract for furnishing
hydrants to th" Fire Department has been
lost to manufacturers, and the city will
hereafter turn out its own hydrants.
It is something almost if not quite un-
Sented for the municipality to en
!!i the foundry business, but Chief
Sullivan assured the Commissioners that
there were ample resources at the cor
poration yard for the purpose, so the ex
periment will be made in the hope of sav
\v.s the taxpayers something like $5000 a

five-inch. (5660. Victor Ktienne.
four-inch. $54; five-inch. $60. Chairman
Byingtpn referred the bids to Chief Sulli
van, who pronounced them entirely too
high.
"I have carefully examined into the
COBI of hydrants, with other officials of
the department," said the Chief, "and I
know |ust what they cost." The raw ma
terial, he said, would cost $27 60. and with
the expenditure of an amount not ex
ceeding $500 for brass lathes, the depart
ment could turn them out at the corpora
tion yard at a cost of t'-Vi f.i> each for four
inch and $."0 T.i for five-inch hydrants.
"Do you mean, Chief, that On- depart
ment has facilities for casting and tinisli
ins these hydrants?" asked Mr. Aigeltin
ger.
"Yes; at the corporation yardâ or.
rather, we would have the facilities with
the addition of the brass lathes."
'And these lathes, you say, will cost
$5no?"
"That sum will greatly exceed the cost;
T should Bay that $300 or $400 will pur
chase what we need."
The representatives of two of the bid
ding firms questioned the accuracy of the
Chief's figures, but failing to shake his
confidence In the department's ability to
turn out hydrants at the figures he gaveâ
| " and $3975â they explained their own
figures by sayinig that the price of raw
material had advanced greatly of late.
and there was every indication that it
would go still higher. Moreover, the men
employed in the corporation yard were
paid .<:: a day. while the private firms
paid their men more, and besides had to
figure on a small profit for themselves.
The committee ;tsk. â¢'â  the Chief how
many hydrants he thought would be
needed for the coming fiscal year, and
was Informed that something like 225
would be necessary. The members could
not see any better way to save money
thai: by granting the Fire Department
the necessary brass lathes and let it man
ufacture its own hydrants, so all the bids
were rejected on the ground that they
wen too high and that course was recom
mended to the board.
CHANCE FOR THE CHILDREN.
Special Examination for Those Who
Missed Promotion.

the following resolution, adopted at the
last meeting of the board, is republished
for their information and guidance:

The story of the loss of a box of soy- ;
eroiens from the stoamer Alameda w; s
revived yesterday by tho arrival of the ;
steamer Australia from Honolulu.
Before the Alameda sailed again for
Australia ft was known to Chief Lees and
his detectives that an ox-convict had left
â¢the vessel at Honolulu and that he had
borrowed $5 from a fellow passenger to
ro ashore with, promising to repay it
when his trunk was landed. AVhen the
trunk was put ashore the "ex-con" had
plenty of money and nearly all of it
seemed to be Enprlish money." It was his
intention to remain in Hawaii for soni"
time, but all at once he changed his mind
and took passage for Japan on the Gaelic
Two yuunK men named Marcus Smith :

DAINGERFIELD
MULCTED COOK
FOR CONTEMPT
Justice Ignored Writ
of Prohibition.
DEFIED SUPERIOR COURT
HE SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT
WITHOUT WARRANT.
Changed the Official Record of a Case
in Defiance of a Peremptory
Order of the Higher
TriDunal.
Justice of thÂ« Peace G F. W. Conk
was held to be In contempt of court by
Superior Judge Dalngorfield yesterday for
Ignoring a writ of prohibition issued by
the Litter on the Bth of April in the case
of D. A. Curtln vs. Marie Cassou et al.,
wherein Cook was ordered not to carry
r-'it his declared intention to set aside a
judgment in favor of the ?>lalntiff which
harl been taken in his court by default
on Much 17 last. The plea of the Justice
that he had not been served with the writ
until two days after the order setting
aside the Judgment had been made was
evidently not believed by the court, and
the weight of the evidence was aerainst
such a conclusion. The Judge also ren
dered a decision on the matter which
cp.!led for the issuance of the writ of
prohibition, which is In effect that the
original ,'udcment npainst the defendant
stands as oripinally entered.
Briefly the facts of the ease are as fol
li ws: O. A. Curtin sued Marip Cassod
and Joseph Cassou. her husband. In Jus
tiro Cook's court on a not*- for $3iV) ex
ecuted by the woman before her mar
riage, togeiher with interest and costs.
Judgment was entered by default for
5290 !W. with Interest and costs amounting
to $S;2. An execution was issued against
the community property of tiie two de
fendants, and' the Sheriff of Alameda
County attached the bakery operated by
them in Oakland. Then, although the ten
days allowed by law had expired. P. A.
Bergerot and Moses G. Cobb. attorneys
for the Cassous, appeared before Justice
Cook nnd asked that the minutes of the
proceeding:! 1 ; be changed so that it would
appear that the judgment was against
Mrs. Cassou individually. Cook an
nounced his intention to comply with the
request, statinf that he had bÂ°en imposed
upon when signing the judgment and
ordered the attachment withdrawn at
once.
While the matter was being argued Mr.
Curtin secured a writ of prohibition from
Judge Paintrerfield. which was served on
Cook at 11:30 o'clock on the morning of
April 8, before he had made his order
correcting the minutes. The writ was
isrnored. as was also an order issued by
Presiding Justice of the Peace Kerrigan.
transferring the case to his court, and
Cook proceeded to make an order chang
ing the minutes, nullifying the judgment
he had Figned nearly a month previous
by striking out all "reference to Joseph
Cassou.
For this arbitrary proceeding Cook was
cited before Judge Daingerfield for con
tempt, and the hearing was concluded
yesterday. Cook went on the stand and
swore that he was not served with the
writ until April 10. when a copy of the
document was handed to him by a young
man whom he did not know in the Jus
tices' clerks' office. He insisted that he
had a right to change the minutes in the
rase because he had been deceived and
suppose. l when he signed the judgment
which was prenared by the defendant
that it was against the woman alone.
P M. McOaslin. a depuf- in the office
of the County Clerk, testified that he had
served the writ on Justice of the Peace
Cook at 11:30 o'clock on the morning of
April 8. He had inadvertently left the
original as we]] as the copy in the court
room, and when he returned for It a
short time later he found Cook in his
chambers. Vpon asking the latter for the
writ Cook replied:
"Isn't it there on the table?"
Chief Deputy Goddard of the County
Clerk's office told of sending McGaslin to
serve the writ and that when he returned
ho advised him to make a note of the ser
vice and of the time, which was done.
Attorney TWgerot testified that McGas
lin came into the court room and threw
a paper on the table. After he left he.
â Rergerot. picked up the document and
saw it was a writ of prohibition. He was
positive it had not been served upon the
Justice.
Cook was recalled to the stand and de
nied emphatically that he had acknowl
edged receiving the writ at any time be
fore the 10th of April or that any such
conversation as related by McGaslin had
taken place in his chambers.
Mr. Curtin trok the stand and related
all the circumstances of the case from his
noint of view. As he left the stand Judge
Daingerfield announced that he was ready
to testify as a witness if so desired by
either side. He then stated that he had
occasion to visit Justice Cook's court
room on the morning in question. Mr.
P.ergerot was standing at the bar in the
act of addressing the court and Cook
made some remark about being imposed
uprn. That was the extent of Judge
Daingerfield's testimony as. while he said
he knew there were others present in
the courtroom at the time, he could not
say who they were.
The case was briefly nrgued hv Attor
rey Cobb for Justice Cook and Attorney
\V M Cannon on behalf of Curtin. The
latter said he did not ask that a severe
punishment be inflicted unon the Justice
for his alUcred contempt, but only that
justice be done to his client.
Judge Daingerfield in announcing his
decis : on in the matter said it was clear
to his mind that the writ had been served
before the record of the case had been
ch-irtred on the Sth of April and not on
the lOth'of April. He therefore held that
Cook was in contempt of court, but in
view of the fact that he apneared to have
acted or to have been influenced in his
Action by what he believed to be "a short
cut to justice." and In view of the request
of the opposing counsel that a minimum
punishment be inflicted, in which he con
curred, he would impose a nominal fine of
Â°Tn the matter of the rempdy applied
for In the writ of prohibition the court
held that the judgment should stand as
before the unlawful modification of the
judgment by the . -.stice.

A lAN FROM
MONTANA.
J. P. Smith of Bozeman, Montana, Has
a Novel Experience in San
Francisco
WHAT CAME OF ANSWERING A DOCTOR'S
ADVERTISEMENT.
A member of the numerous and much
maligned family of Smiths landed in ,
I San Francisco recently. He hailed from i
! Bozeman, Montana, and relates an cx-
i perience which might be well for all
j men to read.
"For several months past," said Mr.
I Smith, "I have been reading the vari-
I ous advertisements of Dr. Meyers & â 
; Co. in The Call. Having a physical j
weakness which was both annoying
and embarrassing I decided to write the
doctors a letter, asking for their ad-
vice and their private counselor for ,
men. In due time the mail brought me
all that I asked for and even more.
By 'more' I refer to their booklet. This
was much more valuable than I had
expected to find it. It contains, in j
compact form and in forcible yet simple \
. language, information which every man ,
should know, even if there is nothing
the matter with him.
"This correspondence If . to my tak-
ing treatment by mail. The price agreed
upon was reasonable, and so were the
terms. I paid half down, the balance
;to be held back until I was well. This
was four months ago. I am now en-
tirely cured and feel even stronger than
before that weakness nearly ruined me. '
"All this was accomplished without
seeing the doctors. I came to the city
yesterday on my way to Alaska and to i
pay the doctors what I owed them as
well as to thank them for my present
perfect health and strength."
This is only a sample of the good
work Dr. Meyers & Co. are now and
have been doing on the Pacific Coast
for many years. These specialists cure
all diseases and weaknesses of men.
They use the best and most successful
remedies and methods the world has
ever known. They have ample capital,
a large and ably managed medical in-
stitution, natural ability and the most
extensive practice in America.
They make a specialty of home cures. |
If you are, interested and cannot come
to San Francisco or call on a part of
the staff when they make their regular
monthly visits to interior towns write
for their private book, prices, terms,
etc. Pr Meyers &â  Co. are located at

McGLYNN MIXES
WITH A POLL
TAX COLLECTOR
Hibernia Bank Clerk
Arrested.
WARRANTS FOR THIRTY MORE
DODGE'S MEN HAVE TROUBLE
MAKING COLLECTIONS.
Took Heroic Measures Yesterday
and Created a Little Scene at
Jones and McAllister
Streets.
One employe of the Hlbernia Bank was
arrested yesterday afternoon for refusal
to pay his poll tax or to give his name to
nne of Assessor Dodge's deputies when
requested to do so. The other thlrtj
who showed a like disposition will be ar-
I this morning if they persist in th-ir
evident Intention of evading the tax.
Charles J. McGlynn, a well-known hand
ball player, is the first result of the As
sessor's downcoming on the brink, lie
w;is picked out from all the others for the
reason that he coupled his refusal to
oblige the deputies with his name with I
a demonstration of his intention to do |
bodily harm to one of them. He was
placed under arrest by Patrolman Sam â 
! Uankin on a warrant sworn out before ,
j Police Judge Graham by Frank Putman, i
' chief collector in the Assessor's office, j
i who was still smarting under the treat- ;
j ment he and his assistants had received â 
! earlier in the day from McGlynn and |
I other attaches of the bank.
For three months, according to Asses- :
Bor Dodge, men from his office have been !
trying to collect poll tax from the at- \
taches of the bank. During that time
they have visited the other banks of the
city and have had no trouble in obtaining
from the management the names of the â 
employes. At the Hibernia Bank Secre- '
| tary Tobin refused to give the names of
the attaches, informing- the collectors that
! the men were there and that they were at
; liberty to get their names from their own
ers. On approaching the men personally
I and displaying their badges of office the
; deputies were given what is termed in
spurting parlance "the horse laugh."
Smarting under this treatment, it was
determined, under instructions from Dr.
Dodge, to make a last attempt at collec
tion. With this in view. Chief Collector
Putman and his assistantsâ Deputies
Pratt and Vandeveerâ took -.up their stand
â¢ in front of the bank buildirjg at half-past
8 o'clock yesterday morningl PJtman and
Vandeveer stationed themselves at the
main entrance and Pratt took his place
at the entrance on Jones street. As the
clerks came along they -were stopped and
risked their names. Half a dozen of them
had answered, some of them had skipped
' out of danger's way when they saw the
â  collectors of the head tax, when along
i came McGlynn. He headed straight for
; the Jones-street kntranee and was about
to pass in when Pratt tapped him on the
arm. informed him who he was and asked
â  for his name. M< Glynn bridled up at once
a pass at the deputy, which that
official smothered but did not return, he
having, with the others, received Instruc
: tlons to keep cool under all circumstances.
McGlynn then backed off from Tratt and,
jumping into the door, addressed some one
behind him, saying, "Give me my pun."
I Then he disappeared inside and was not
I seen again by the Assessor's deputies un
til the warrant was served upon him.
Deputies Putman and Vandeveer had
i but little better success than Pratt, hav
-1 ing succeeded in getting the names of but
; nine of the forty odd employes of the i
i bank, eight of these having already paid ,
; the tax for this year. After hearing
I Pratt's story of his mix-up with Me- |
! Glynn, whose name they did not know,
! the three deputies resolved to report at
! once to the Assessor. When Dr. Dodge
i heard their story he was very wroth and
! contemplated an immediate descent upon
j the bank and a wholesale arrest of the
recalcitrants. He modified this Intention
later by ordering Putman to swear out a
"John "Doe" warrant for the arrest of
Pratt's assailant, announcing his inten
; tion of going after the others refusing to
I divulge their names to-day.
Owing to the inability of the Assessor s
i deputies to find a Police Court clerk be
' tween the noon hour and 3 o'clock, they
: had to cool their heels in the halls until
Police Judge Graham came along and
issued the warrant, which was served ;
afterward on McClynn. His case win be |
set for hearing this morning.
Assessor Dodge was of the opinion that
Secretary Tobin, despite the fact that he
is a Police Commissioner, was guilty of
a misdemeanor in refusing to give the
names of the employes of the bank. He
thought Tobin was guilty, at any rate, of
offering a technical obstruction to the
tax collectors. That portion of the poll
tax law which the Assessor thought
would apply to such a case reads as rol
â¢ lows:
434 â Every person who, when requested by
' the Collector of taxes or licenses, refuses to
give such Collector the name and residence of
; each man in hi? employment or to give to
such Collector access to the building or place
i where such men are employed, is guilty ot
: a misdemeanor.
Whether or not any action will be taken
1 against Mr. Tobin depends upon the out
: come of the cases against McGlynn and
the others who will be arrested if they
fail to pay up.

RAID ON THE STATE
Plan to Abolish the Harbor Pile-
Driving Plant.
An Effort Being Made to Thrnst a New Parasite
Upon the Treasuryâ An Interesting Meeting of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners.
Harbor Commissioner Paris Kilburn gave notice yesterday
to his associates on the board that he intends to urge that all fu
ire pile driving on the water front be done by contract. The
mnouncement of Commissioner Kilburn is of general public in
'â  If the change suggested by him is made the State will
be forced to sacrifice the benefits of a heavy investment in pile
drivers, and will be placed at the mercy of private contractors,
in whose behalf the change is suggested.
The innovation proposed by Commissioner Kilburn is be
ing resisted by Commissioners Harney and Herold, who main
tain that the proposed change cannot but work an evil to the
State. There is more than a usual significance to the proposi
tion made by Commissioner Kilburn in the fact that a certain
member of the Republican State Central Committee has recent
. become financially interested in the business of pile driving.
politician enjoys the confidence and support of Governor
I rage, who appointed Paris Kilburn to his present official posi
ti< m.
If the Harbor Commissioners -were to sacrifice their pile
driving plant and have the work which it now does performed
under private contract the friend of Governor Gage would find
open an avenue of reward in his new investment. The field is
an exceptionally remunerative one. Contracts would he let to
the lowest bidder, but in the shuffling of official cards the lowest
... crally a favorite.
The purpose of the scheme is so apparent that success is
' kely to follow the attempt. The exigencies of water front
work in pile driving on the various wharves make it imperative
that the State own its own plant. A great deal of money has
been invested; in the plant now owned by the State and it is not
able that it will be sacrificed to pay a political debt.

lenta the serious charges brought
nst til-- old-style coffee. I knew
thÂ«>m to contain Bimple and accurate
ments <>f scientific fact which any
physiologist or hygienist could sub-
stantial.'.
"Still, as an old coffee drinker, it was j
hard to make up my mind to change |
the old habit which had become seem-
ingly so fixed a part of my life. For
many weeks I allowed myself to read
your sober warnings and stirring ap-
peals to the conscience and reason of
the people, without taking action, not-
withstanding- the fact that I had for j
years felt the habit was undermining I
my nervous force, Impairing the mem-
ory, weakening the sight and threaten-
ing even to soften the brain. I had
also come across numerous instances
among my acquaintances of dyspepsia
brought about or largely aided by the
accumulated evils of dally coffe drink-
Ing.
"An old restaurant man finally in-
duced !;.â â ;., im a trial, he
' mi:; adopted it as one I
of their household staples. I knew;
him to be â  hal of a coffee con- i
noisseur, and was the more impressed'
by his suggestion. My first trial was
unsatisfactory and I put It away, but
fortunately J n â¢ â  d your published
warning aa to not cooking the coffee
sufficiently, and I saw then that I had i
not given it a fair trial; so i went at it I
again, and this last trial was sufficient!
to convince me that the product is in-

the large Jobs are done by contract but

"Well, there's no harm in trying it for
six months." Interposed Kllhurn "We
can tell in that time whether it is such
a saving as would warrant its continu

and in the right direction."
"No one Is more in favor of economy

UNITED AT NOON
IN ST. JOHN'S CHURCH
MISS EMMA M. CLAWSON and HENRY S.
BASS, Who Were Married Yesterday.
ST. JOHN'S EPISCOPAL ('lU'RCir was beautifully decorated yrs
terday on tho occasion <>f the marriage of Henry S. Buss and Miss
Emma M. t'lawson, well-known youns society people of this city.
There was also a large attendance of friends and Immediate rela
tives of tho family who witnessed th^ nuptials. Rev. William A. M.
Breek, the associate rector of tho church, officiated at tho ceremony, which
was made more impressive and beautiful by the presence of the vested choir.
At the conclusion of the bans the bridal party and repaired to the
home of the bride's parents at I2'.i Oak street and sal down to an elaborate
wedding breakfast. In the afternoon the happy pair left on a two weeks'
honeymoon at Del Monte and other delightful places.
Mr. Bass Is at the head of the Empire Suit Company in the Phelan build
ing. He is well known in club circles, being a member of the Olympic and
Entre'Nous Cotillon clubs and other organizations. The bride is a daughter
of L. E. Clawson, senior member of Clawson & Co., the well-known pot
tery and patent chimney dealers at 1340 Market street. She is very
popular in local society, being both beautiful and accomplished. On their
return from the honeymoon the young couple will take up their residence
in this city.

'extras.' Then there Is no means of esti
mating the number of piles that will be
required and the bidders will not be able
to bid Intelligently."
"There is no harm in trying," was Kll
burn's remark again. "The contractors
can do the work much cheaper than we
can, as they can get better men and for
less money than you or I can. If a man
goes to a contractor for a job he has to
show his qualifications; but if a man
comes to you or me, major, it's always
what he has done for the G. O. P. Now.
supposing these contractors should offer
to supply and drive piles for $10 each,
what would you do?"
"I have not the slightest doubt but what
we will g-ot low bids," said Commissioner
Herold. speaking for the first time. "The
contractors want to drive our piledrivers
off the front and their offer will be way
down. Then they will share the loss
among themselves. In the meantime our
plant will be going to rack and ruin and
when the second contract comes to be let
the prices will double. Then where will
we be? What I should counsel is to let
well enousrh alone. We are entering on a
new f-ra. The repair department has been
abolished and all this kind of work is now
directly under the supervision of the chief
engineer. Let us give him a chance and
make no more changes until we see where
we are. We can discuss reductions and
Improvements with the head of the de
partment, and I think we will eventually
gpt better and cheaper results than from
contract work."
At this point ex-Governor Budd jokingly
remarked that it would be a good idea
for the single Republican member of the
Board to wait until another Republican
took his seat, and then he could abolish
all the departments he desired. "I hardly
think it right, Mr. Chairman," said he,
with a laugh, "to ask two Democrats to
abolish the piledrivers and throw a lot
of Democrats out of office. Just wait
a while and air your economical streak
when your own friends are running the
piledriv<Ts."
Contractor Dundon was present and was
asked what was the average pay of his
men. and he answered from $3 to $5 a day.
The men on the State piledrivers get from
$100 to $115 a month. The discussion will j
be continued when Chairman Kilburn pre
sents his resolution next Tuesday.
S. J. Hendy of the Pacific Refining and
Roofing Company asked permission to bid !
for supplying patent piles. He has a new I
process and wants to have its merits |
tested. The board needs 277 preserved
pil^s nnd it was decided to so word the
call for tenders that every man who has
a patent process can bid.
Accidentally Smothered.
The attention of Coroner Hill was dt
rpct^d yesterday morning to a peculiar
fif-ath which took plarc at 6 a. m. in the
Florence Crittenton Home.
It was reported* to him that lAike Crlb
bens. the five weeks old son of Sarah
Cribbens, an Inmate of the home, had
been accidentally smothered by its
mother. The story told by the mother
was that she nursed the child at 3 o'clock
in the morning and went to sleep. When
she awoke at â¢> o'clock the baby was dead,
btedly having been suffocated.
Coroner Hill ascertained that Miss Crib
w.is unmarried. The Florence Crit
tenton Home is an institution for the
shelter and reform of erring women and
girls. Deputy Coroner Lacombe Investi
gated the case and concluded that death
was accidental. The managers of the
home refused to give any information
regarding the parents of the child.
Battered a Policeman
May Modre, alias "Black Frankip." was
convicted by Judge Graham yesterday of
the charges of battery and vagrancy and
was ordered ro appear for sentence this
morning. Early Saturday morning she
was arrested by Policeman Joy at Turk
md Mason streets and at once showed
fight. Her aggressive style of fighting
puzzled Joy. as he did not like to strike
a W'.man. and if the patrol wagon had
not arrived at the time it did Joy would
have been knocked out.
All Bids Rejected.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday
morning to consider the bids for four-inch
and five-inch hydrants. On the recom
mendation of Chief Sullivan all the bids
ted, as he said the hydrants
could be mad" at the corporation yards
much cheaper than the lowest bids.

MERRILL DID
NOT APPEAR
Constituents Awaited
His Coming.
HAMILTON REGGINS WAS HOT
REBUKED FOR INDULGING IN
PERSONALITIES.
A Lively Session of the Thirty-Sixth
District Republican Club,
V ith a Large At
tendance.
Members of the Thirty-sixth District
Republican Club met last night at Twin
Peaks Hall, Seventeenth and Noe streets,
In the expectation that they would hear
Assemblyman A. H. Merrill's reply to the
attack made on him at the last meeting
by Chairman Frank French. They had
been informed by printed cards sent to
their addresses that the Assemblyman
would "tell his constituents about 'How |
I did It at Sacramento.' " The card bore I
the signature of a committee of seven,
who invited all Republicans to be present.
In the absence of president or vice
president of the club, W. C. Johnson was i
chosen to preside, James Nagle acting as !
secretary of the meeting. There were j
some inquiries at the start for Merrill,
who had not put In an appearance, and it j
was freely asserted that he would not
COtne. The minutes of the previous meet- \
ing, containing a resume of the assault
on the Assemblyman and showing that
he had been invited to attend the next
meeting, were read and approved. Cap- I
tains of several precincts reported good
progress in enrolling Republicans, and J. I
B. Barber and C. E. Xagle stated for the i
benefit of new members the plan of the j
central club.
Hamilton Reg-gins then took the floor to
discuss the attitude of Assemblyman
Merrill. He said that he did not think
that the Assemblyman was treating the !
club right in staying away and refusing
to give an account of his stewardship at
Sacramento. As he proceeded in his re
marks he became heated, and before he was
interrupted, had denounced the Assembly
man as a cur and advocated, not only
that he be scalded to the heels, but that
ho be roanted a? well.
His personal remarks brought declama
tory protests from the chair and from |
James McCormick. and a motion that was j
about to be put by Mr. Riggins that the I
club put Its displeasure at Mr. Merrill on I
record was lost in the temporary excite- '
ment. A few moments later Mr. Reggins
apologized to the club for such of his re
marks as had been excepted to, saying I
that they had been forced out of him by i
the heat of anger.
A resolution by James Nagle was
ndopted to the effect that It is the sense
of the club that delegates to the Repub- j
lican Municipal Convention be selected by
districts. The club then adjourned to
meet next Tuesday night at the same hall, j

Democrats of the Thirty-Ninth
Assembly District Meet in
Saratoga Hall.
The Democratic Club of the Thirty- |
ninth Assembly District held a well-at- '
; tended meeting In Saratoga Hall at Sl4 j
Geary Btreet last night. President Whit- :
tlng announced that Mayor Phelan had
accepted the Invitation extended him to I
become an honorary member of the club
and the announcement was greeted with i
I vociferous applause. In fact it was a
; Pbelan meeting from start to finish, every
| reference t<> the Mayor during the even
: ing. and such references were frequent,
being the signal for similar demonstra- :
! tions rif enthusiasm. Twenty-seven new
; members were enrolled, and after the
j committee on ways and means had bnen
granted additional time in which to for
: mulate a report, J. H. Ferran offered a
resolution providing that a special meet
! ing of the club be held not later than July
15 to choose candidates to the municipal
Democratic convention. He moved that
th>' resolution be adopted, but an amend
ment proposed by t'harles Meehan to re
fer it to the committee on resolutions was
carried with a whoop, in spite of the trt
forts of the author to withdraw It when
he saw it was doomed to be practically
buried. Ferran then offered the substance
of the resolution in the form of a motion, j
I but the club would have nothing of his
scheme and snowed the motion under.
Walter Thompson proposed that a com
| noittee of seven be appointed by the chair:
| to select B list of candidates for the con
vention who would receive the support
â of the dub. This time It wns Ferrans
turn to obj. .-t. He declared that all mem
! bers should have the right to propose can- '
I didates. but he was again voted down and
i the motion was declared carried.
Hrlef addresses by Senator H. Porter
Ashe, Senator W. E. White, M. C. Has
: sett. Assemblyman J. S. Wardell and Dr
Leland followed, the speakers confining
their remarks for the most part to ihe
new primary election law and the neces
sity of earnest work at the primaries by
all good Democrats. Ashe, White and
Hassett were unanimously elected hono
rary members of the organization. The
! club adjourned subject to the call of the ;
I president.

There was a good attendance of the
i Democrats of the Thirty-seventh Assem
\ bly District at Phelpa Hall, 317 Devisa
dero street, last night. The clul) has a
membership of over 300, and from the
enthusiasm manifested In the district It
is very evident that active steps wlllvbe
taken "by the respectable element to put
forth a "representative delegation at the
coming primaries. Fifty new names were
! added to the list at the meeting last
' night after which those present were
; addressftd by Judge A. D. Lemon. Charles

and J. H. McLaughlin, all of whom re

The comic party given last evening by
James A. Garfield Relief Corps No. 21 In

were varied. For the entertainment of
the guests the committee, consisting of

EASTERN MARKETS.
â  !W TORK 3TOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June -To-day'? advance in 'â 
prices of stocks after an early weakness was ! '
no more conclusive of a settled condition of i â 
the speculative situation and of the future i '
course of the stock market than was yester- j '
day's decline. There was a brief and spas- '
inodic reriod of liquidation in Federal Steel '. '
and Wire, and the bear party took advantage |
of th!p to make a drive against the whole mar- ! :
ket. Hut the brief duration of the decline and ' i
Die firm resistance offered by prices at the low '<
point warned the bears of the futility of an
effort to bn*ak the whole market. They there
lore took their profits on the decline of yes
terday and this morning by buying stocks at
the low lÂ«veL There -a .is some organized buy- j !
Ins of the Flower group of specialties, not j i
only in support of Federal Steel, but for the | â 
long account in Brooklyn Transit, People's Gas I
and other specialties. The action of the wheat I '
market prompted some buying from rangers I
also. The continued weakness of wheat In the !
face of the well leflned information of poor j
crops in Russia and Eastern Europe made the ' :
conclusion unavoidable that supplies of Ameri- i
can .â .i' were believed to be forthcoming by I
those who re beat able to Judge. Aside from
this the market continued very narrow and I
professional and could not be said to repre- I
sent anything more than the covering of short j
contracts by yesterday's bears. The opening i
In both Federal Steel and Steel and Wire was !
wide. 8000 shares of the former .selling at a
drop of l'-'aZ points and 6000 shares of the lat
ter showing simultaneous transactions from 114
Cx 2's below last night's prices. The motive, of
course, was the granting of the Judicial injunc
tion against the payment of the IV. per cent I
dividend which has been declared on Federal
Bteel common on the ground that before the i
expiration of the fiscal year the prior right of
the preferred stock to Its 6 per cent dividend :
could n..t be Insured. The statement of Presi- i
dent Gary that a sufficient sum had already
been set aside to pay a yearly dividend on
the preferred stock was the decisive Influence
In the rally or both stocks. The net decline
for each on the day Is only about a point.
Bather conspicuous ngth was shown by the
Union Pacific stock* New York Central and I
Pennsylvania in the late dealings, but as tney i
have recently h;ui sharp declines, relatively
greater advances were only natural. Opera
tions by . aiders through commission houses
continued at a minimum. Sugar was strong.
Continental and American Tobacco was weak !
and the local traction stocks moved upward' j
Pome apprehension still exists over the threat
ening situation in France and South Africa, |
and the ruling price for money in Berlin, which
1? the result of a rather unbridled speculation ;
The advance In money in Berlin was reflected
In higher discount rates in London and an ad
vance In the nit- for sterling exchange here, â 
â¢which Is believed to foreshadow a further out- i
flow of gold. J

RAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 20.â The opening In wheat
was a lively one, and for an hour the mar
! ket was as weak as even the most persistent j
bear could desire. September opened at TT\
7774 c, compared with yesterday's closing price
of 78'/ic. Large quantities of long wheat were i
offered, both local and outside traders dump- |
Ing their holdings on the market, and when
the first lull In the liquidation occurred, the
! price had been hammered down to 77c. News
' was of such a character as to discourage longs
who have been banking on the Russian crop
damage to offset the prospects of a big do
-1 mestic crop. General rains were reported in
Roumanla and rainfall was also reported from
; some parts of the Russian drought districts
I with a consequent improvement In crop pros-
I pects In those countries. Liverpool cables were
weak and lower. At the Mart there was a dis
position among shorts to cover at the decline,
but the bearlshness of domestic advices put
a check to even this support. With the ex-
I ception c. Nebraska and Kansas, In which
States some hot winds were reported, the
weather throughout the wheat country was re
ported favorable. Shortly before noon the mar
ket recovered a trifle in the absence of heavy
celling pressure, September advancing to 77 1 ; .
but liquidation was renewed after noon and
prices got down to a still lower level. Brad
street's showed an increase In the visible of
1,889,000 bushels, compared with 2.734,000 bush
| els decrease last year. During the last halt
hour there was increased selling by disgusted
long?, September gradually declining to 767ic,
where it closed.
Corn was fairly active and weak. The weak
ness was partly with wheat, but local influ
ences were also present. September lost 4c.
Oats ruled lower all day in sympathy with
wheat and corn, closing at the bottom with
a loss of 4c in September.
Provisions, considering the weakness in grain,
were fairly steady, especially aurlng. the morn
ing. Later the market yielded a little with
grain, but the close was steady. September
pork closed 74c lower, lard unchanged and
ribs 24c lower. :â â¢â¢â¢.-â

Bullish news continues to be received from
the Continent, but the market hangs lire Just
the same. Btrassburg cabled Chicago that the
outlook for the French and German crops was
less favorable. Beerbohm cabled that dry, hot
and unfavorable weather continued in South
ern Russia. A Budapest cable, reported rust
and other unfavorable condition! in Hungary.
Continental buyers again appeared in Chicago,
but the selling of large operators discouraged
them. July liquidation is holding the market
j down and the big Corn longs are selling Wheat
as a hedge. The St. Louis traders also sold
I heavily.

WILL SWELL THE FUND.
Alameda Enthusiastic Over the
Dewey Monument.
ALAMEDA. June 20.â This city will do
; its share toward contributing to the
i Dewey monument fund. Mayor Phelan's
circular letter appealing to the authori
ties of the interior cities to help along
the patriotic enterprise was read at last
night's meeting of the Board of City
i Trustees and was received with enthu
siasm. â '%;. â¢'
Chairman John G. Brick warmly com-
I mended the movement and stated that
| Alnmeda should certainly contribute
. handsomely to the fund. "1 am only
sorry." he said, "that I am not in a posi
: tion to put my hand in my pocket and
1 make a big donation."
; Mr. Mackie stated the undertaking was
I a patriotic one and should receive every
j assistance from the city authorities.
It was decided to open the subscription
i Hut at once. Some time during the week
i Mr. Brick will appoint a committeee of
f citizens to take charge of the matter. In
j the meantime subscriptions will be re
i ceived by City Clerk Lamborn.
Seebach's Death Was Accidental.
ALAMEDA, June Â»>.â The Coroner's
jury that Inquired into the death of
Harry Seebach Jr.. the young man who
was drowned in the estuary off the Cali
fornia Yacht Club's house Saturday
night, returned a verdict this cvÂ» nlng of
accidental drowning. Nothing new â  de
veloped from the testimony brought out
at the inquest. C S. Moore and G. H.
Craig, who were in the boat with Seebach
when it capsized, could throw no light
on the tragedy, nor could they tell how
the accident occurred. According to their
testimony the boat lurched and turned
over, and that was all they knew about

Oakland Office San Francisco Call. ?0S Broadway, June 20.
FOR a few seconds this morning M. Prendergast was being whirled around
and around on the belts of swiftly moving machinery. That he escaped
with his life is due to the fa-t that one of his fellow employes caught light
of him before he w_\s crusrea to death and had the presence of mind to
Stop the machinery.
Prehdergast ! Â» a mill nand employed at the Oakland Planing Mills. About
an hour after commencing work this morning Prenderpast was standing by
his machine, when his clothing caught in a belt. Instantly he was lifted from
his feet and was revolving around one of the large belt wheels. In a few sec
onds he would have been thrown among the heavy parts of the machinery.
While being whirled along a part 01" his clothing caught on a screwhead on the
side of the wheel. This stopped him from being carried around entirely, and
at the same instant some one stopped the machinery Prendergftat's clothes
were twisted so tightly around hie neck and body that in many places his skin
was torn off. HÂ«Â» sustained a few simple cuts but no serious Injuries. His es

90S Broadway, June 20. â 
The Board of Works will hold a regular
meeting to-morrow. The most interest
ing feature of the meeting will be the mc
i...;. .I.i.i the conduct of John Rohan,
; foreman in the Fire Department, and Spe
! rfa! Officer James Brannan. Mr. Dow
I has !<vo resolutions with the board call
\:.g for the discharge of these two men,
i Lut so far has been unable to get the
' second vote in the board necessary to re
l move them.
Last we k Mr. Dow declined to Rive his
reasons for introducing the resolutions,
but remarked, "You all know, as well as
I do, why these resolutions should pass."
The Mayor would not take snap Judg
ment without giving the two men an op
portunity to explain, so an order was
made that' Rohan and Brannan walk the
carpet at to-morrow's meeting.
Branr.an's shortcomings consist in his
behavior during the 'last "city campaign.
He was a firm supporter of Thomas Gar
rtty, the Democratic candidate for Mr.
Dow's position. It Is alleged that he not
only worked openly for Mr. Garrity,
which is against the rules of the Police
Department, but that he also spoke very
disrespectfully of Mr. Dow, who by virtue
of his office is a Police Commissioner.
Immediately after the election Mr. Dow
ordered the Chief of Police to tempor
arily retire Brannan. This was done, and
after he had been suspended for six
weeks he was by the votes of the Mayor
and City Engineer restored to duty. be r
cause Mr. Dow had filed no complaint
in the long Interval. Brannan thinks this
was punishment enough, and that the in
cident should be closed. But it is more
than probable that no action will be taken
until the new Chief has had an oppor
tunity to watch the special officer and
report as to his present behavior. ;.j-
John Rohan is another very active
Democratic politician. Mr. Dow has not
yet stated upon what grounds he would
remove Rohan, but will probably do so
to-morrow. Rohan is an o.ld .and accord
ing to his superiors a good fireman, arid
a strong effort is being made to prevent
his retirement. Should Brannan be re
tired,, Charles Clarke, a motorman. will
be given his position.
Mr. Dow will also call up . his resolu
tion, reappointing Mr. Miller Superin
tendent of Streets.

AMUSING FEATURES OF CONGRE

Events That Tendered to Enliven

Folks.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. June 20.
Some 800 men, women and children,
members of the First Congregational I
Church and Sunday-school, enjoyed their I
third annual, outing and picnic at Leona !
Heights to-day, and one of the chief
! features of the day's sports was the base- j
I ball game between married and single
! men. Stanford University athletes and
baseball cranks will never know what
they missed until they have seen Rev. S
Charles R. Brown hold down first base,
with lively zephyrs soughing his locks and
a determined look upon his kindly coun
tenance as he stretches his suspenders
to reach skyward for a t wirier to save
the day for his side
During the forerlbon there was a
"scrub" baseball game, as the young
players termed it. Later a tug-of-war ;
was aranged. Then luncheon. The
weather was perfect, the air balmy and
appetites almost ferocious. After the in
ner man had been satisfied â  the running
races were announced. However, there
were so many ties and the time for run
i ning off finals being limited, every one
who had entered was given credit for
having done so well, no prizes being
given.
' In the three-lesTKed race "Eddie" Me-
[ Oracken and "Johnny" Jones won the
plaudits of all spectators as winners, and
in the sack race "Eddie" McCracken
. bagged all his opponents, while Gup Roth,
aged. 13 years, won the potato race clev
erly. The great baseball same was be
tween the married and single men. and it
proved a "stunner." Unfortunately Mayor
Snow was unable to attend and act as
umpire, and to 1 this fact the married men
attribute their defeat. Mr. Chamberlain,
with hi? big straw hat protecting his
complexion from the sun's glare, acted in
the Mayor's stead.
Alex T. Stewart filled the box for the
married men. but he demonstrated that
music hath more charms than the twirl
ing of the leathern ball. City Auditor
, Breed nobly defended second base from
the advances of those who might by sheer
luck have passed Pastor Brown at first
base: and Carey Howard, the popular
i attorney, acted as shortstop and let
nothing "pass him except the breeze. The
, line-up was as follows: :
Married. â  Position. Singles
â  Alex T. Stewart.. Pitcher Walt Flint
R. L. Jennings â Catcher Stuart Hawley
Rev. C. R. Brown. First base Jewett Katie

The remarkable 9core of 36 to 16 in favor
of the bachelors was largely attributed to
the fact that in the eighth inning P. Gris-
I wold broke the second and only bat, C.
K. Keyes having broken the other one in
j the third inning. The damage to players
: -was not very great, the injured being
Jennings and Breed, who left the field
with "game" fingers.
The concluding event was a tug-of-war
', between married men and single men. in

GUESTS IN THE

THEIR WILL

Hostelry.
ALL OVER A CHINESE COOK
DOZENS OF SUITS ARE FILED
IN LOCAL COURTS.
Will Ec a Conference To-Day to Sea
if Some of the Many Land
lords Cannot Be Pla
cated.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. June ?0,
Half a hundred guests in the old-estab
lished Windsor Hotel are wondering what
to do, and as they are literally in the dark
the task is not an easy one. The hotel
is full of attachment suits, damage suits
and actions of ejectment. .
In the courts all sorts of stories are on
file, and, according to the tales, of the
principals, there must have been some re
markably torrid times in the old hotel
this year. P. W. Schutze owns the prop
erty, arid he rented it to Mrs. Kate Prit
chard, who in turn sublet it to Mrs. Clara
Bell Gardiner. The two ladies could not
agree from the first. The sub-lease in
cludes -a provision that Mrs. Prltehard
should reside at the hotel and have her
own rooms. Although there are fifty
seven rooms in the hotel, it is not large
enough for these two ladies to dwell to
gether in peace ami unity. At the present
time there is a suit in ejectment named
Schutze vs. Prltehard and Gardiner; an
other suit, Pritchard vs. Gardiner et al.
(all the tenants individually): still an
other suit is entitled Gardiner vs. Prit
chard, for $299 damages. There has also
been a case in the Police Court regarding
the picking by a- Chinese cook of an al
leged live chickca. and also within the
same period another series of cases in the
Police Court resulting from the raiding
of a very select faro game in this old
established and very reputable hotel.
When the guests rented their rooms
they were told that they could use the
telephone, that they would certainly have
gas in their rooms and that there would
be tires provided when they needed them.
It was also understood that occasionally
clean linen would be supplied to the lodg
ers. At the present time the telephone
company has cut off. the machine, gas
company likewise; coal has given out:
linen is not to be found; and all because
there are two landladies, each demanding 1
the rent and each refusing to give secur
ity for the necessary obligations of the
hotel.
"It. all began over that chicken," said
Mrs. Gardiner, when asked to explain her
suit for damages against Mrs. Pritchard.
"I was running the house and Mrs. Prit
chard was doing her best to induce lodg
ers to go elsewhere. I had a Chinese
cook, and one day, just at dinner time, I
went into the kitchen and there were two
police officers, who had come to take
away Lum. I asked that he be permitted
to stay till the guests' appetites were -sat
isfied; but this was denied me, and then 1
learned to my great surprise that on in
formation supplied by Mrs. Pritchard my
cook was to be arrested for picking a live
chicken. I .urn never did such a thing.
Chinese fashion, he, cut the . chicken's
neck and bent it back, and perhaps the
bird may have fluttered for a second or
two, but that was all. He was acquitted,
but my guests had lost their dinner, for I
couldn't get a dinner ready to save my
life. Then Mrs. Pritchard told me that I
had made her out a prevaricator in the
Police Court and that she would not be
satisfied till I got out of the house."
According to Mrs. Gardiner's story, the.
unpleasantness in the house increased and
finally all her tenants were served with
attachment notices for their rent, requir
ing them to pay it to Mrs. Pritchard. One
morning there was a very lively scrim- !
mage in the hall between Mrs. Pritchard i
and Mrs. Gardiner's maid. Clara. Both
were anxious to have possession of the
bunch of keys, and the maid succeeded
in retaining them. While this was going
on Mr. Schutze appeared with his lawyer,
but it is reported that when he* saw the
little affair he said it was no place for a
gentleman and quickly retired.
The hotel is a valuable property and it
is not likely that the .present complica- j
tions can exist long. An attempt will be
made to-morrow to compromise on all
sides, and there will be a conference of
all the attorneys interested toward this

A Sensible Shopper.
It is a common happening for wofn^n
shoppers to be taken for saleswomen in
the big department stores, and it is in
teresting to note the effect of some of the
mistakes. The "breaks" are especially
numerous in the hat departments, where
the customers take off their hats in order
to try on new ones. In many cftsee shop
pers who are addressed hy other shop
pers with a query. "Will -ou please show
me some of the hats?" become indignant,
and sharply reply that they are not sales
women, but a prominent, wealthy woman
of West Walnut street proved an excep
tion to this rule in one of the most popular
stores the other day. The salesgirl who
was waiting on her. and who has been
doing so for years, had left her to go after
another hat for her to try on. when a
woman stepped up to the customer and
expressed a desire to look at some speci
mens of headwear. The Walnut-street
woman promptly took the new-comer in
tow and gave her the benefit of her
knowledge about a number of hats which
she had examined in her own search.
When the salesgirl appeared she turned
the woman over to ncr and excused her
self, while the girl, sizing up the situation,
went ahead and made a good sale of a hat
that her customer had praised. Then the
Other customer, who had patiently wait
ed, congratulated herself on having made
a sale for the girl, made her choice of a
hat and departed smiling.â Philadelphia

MRS. MAY PARRY AGAIN
PLACED UNDER ARREST

band Jailed on a Bench Warrant.
HE preliminary examination of Mrs. May Parry, charged with man-
I slaughter causing- the death of her husband, will be held with man
li irh of her husband, will be held ef --â â 
t Graham this morning, when interesting developments .re expected^
Bond Kxpert Newman reported to the police yesterday that, in his opin
ion, the bonds accepted for Mrs. Parry's release last Saturday were not suf
ficient. The sureties were her mother, Mrs. Van Valkenbiirg, who qualified
.on property in Woodland, and Herbert Lunt of the Great Eastern M!lk Com
pany. Newman explained- thai he had no means of verifying Mrs. Van
Valkenhurtr's qualifications and the Great Eastern Milk Company Is only
assessed for $500. In view of the developments In the papers he ought it
his duty to communicate the facts to Chief Lees.
Word was sent to Judge Graham and he at once issued a bench warrant
for Mrs. Parry's arrest, which was handed to Detective Fitzgerald to be
served upon her. Mrs. Parry was taken to the City Prison In the afternoon
and was soon visited by her mother and other relatives. She will remain
in prison until sureties are procured acceptable to the bond expert.
When questioned in prison yesterday as to the truth of the story that she
was Edith Parry who had an unenviable record in Tucson, Ariz.,' she said
quietly, but tirmly. "I have absolutely nothing to say for publication." The
Arizona story has had the effect of infusing life Into the .... and Chief
I,ees" orlirinal opinion that Mrs. Parry was a young innocent w man, barely
17 years of age. rns received a rude lock.

ELECTION OFFICERS
FOR THE PRIMARIES
MEETING OF THE BOARD OF
ELECTION COMMISSIONERS.
Voters to 3e Cited to Appear and Be
Examined as to Theii- Quali
fications to Act.
There Is much hard work before the
Election Commissioners In the selection ;
of precinct officers for thr primary elec- ;
tinn In August. Under the consolidation i
there are V% precincts and each precinct .
require;- six officers. Thp Commisslonera
met y- -â¢â â 'â 'â . f. Mayor Phelan presiding,
and Auditor Wells. Tax Collector Shee
ban, Citj Attorney Lane and Surveyor
Tilton being present, and Rave the matter
some consideration.
Registrar Steppacher called attention i
to the fact that under the provisions of J
the primary election law the bqard is re- ;
quired to name the election officers on or !
before July 14. He stated that he and his
deputies had been at work on the matter ;
and had compiled a list of names taken j
! from the great register in each precinct ]
of the Thirtieth. Thirty-first, Thirty-third :
and Thirty-fourth districts, and submit- â 
ted a copy of the list to each of the mem- j
bers. He said he did not know the poli- i
tics of the men he had listed and the only j
way to pet that Information would be to !
send to each one and make Inquiry. i
After some discussion Mayor Phelan
suggested that the Commission try an (
experiment and cite twelve men from j
each precinct of a certain district to ap- â 
pear before the board for examination j
as to their qualifications to serve as elec- j
' tion officers, the names to be selected hap- I
hazard from the great register. The :
question was raised whether the board \
had authority to take such procedure and ;
it was the opinion of the members that '
the new primary election law. which pro- [
vides that any qualified elector whose, |
name is on* the assessment roll may be j
appointed and compelled to serve on pre- j
cinct boards, also gives such authority, i
The suggestion met with favor and a j
motion by Mr. Sheehan to that effect was
carried. 'The Thirtieth District was se
lected for the experiment and Thursday
night at S o'clock the time set for those
cited to appear before the board. These ]
election officers will receive no pay. but ,
if they are qualified to serve and are ap
pointed by the board they are obliged to !
I serve.
i Registrar Steppacher made a report, of :
; which the following is a part:
1 respectfully beg leave to report that the
total registration m November 8. IS?*, was
! ti2.:?.6. From November S. IS9S. to May IT, 1559.
; there were 46Â« cancellations by reason of deaths.
! removals, f-tr. I"!' to May 17. 1859. there were
1 M new registrations. From May 17 to June 13
j there were 217 new registrations, and during :
I the same period there were 242 changes of resi
dence, making the total registration at this
date 62,053.
The election laws. Including the provisions nt
! the new charter, ami also the laws relating to I
' bond elections, have been compiled. I request ,
i authority to invite bids to be opened by the ,
i b>ard for the printing of 2000 copies of the j
i election laws.
: Bids should also he Invited for the printing i
1 of the various forms, blanks and stationery
j that will be required for the primary election
! Authority was granted to call for bids
i for printing the election laws and for
: the blanks, etc.. asked for. and the board j
j adiourned to meet Thursday night.
Want Pound Limits Extended.
The newly organized improvement club
at South San Francisco will make a de
termined effort to have the Supervisors
extend the pound limits to a sufficient
area beyond the immediate front steps of
the residence portion of the settlement.
As it is now, people who would like to
cultivate flower gardens about their
homes are prevented from so doing be
cause of the numerous goat family, who
haveâ or at least consider they haveâpre
emptive rights not only on the common
pasturage but to feed and grow fat on the
cultivated plants within the home in
closures.
The goat family, though numerous
enousrh. is not alone in the field of prowl
ers who annoy the residents, for meander
ing hoes and rattle from Hutchertown
which have escaped the knife for the
time-being make the inhabited portion of
the slope their favorite camping ground.

One Bank Too Many.
The State Board of Bank Commission
ers yesterday received the information
that the Santa Monica Commercial Bank
had decided to go into voluntary liquida
tion on July 1. Notice has been sent to
all of the creditors to call and pet their
money, and the wish is expressed that
the doors can be closed on the date men
tioned. The reason for this action is
that there is not enough business In Santa
Monica to support two banks, especially
when there are other banks so near in Los
A ngeles.

The convention wa? opened by Presi
dent W. F. Pierce, who Introduced Dr.
F. A. C. Perrine. The latter read a re
port on "Tests and Calculations for a
Forty-Mile Aluminum Wiro Transmis
sion Line." Dr. Perrine is at ti.
of the electrical engineering department
at Stanford University. His report was
technical in the extreme and provoked
a great deal of discussion on the rela
tive value of copper and aluminum as
conductive material. F. K. T. Lee told
what \ip knew of the properties of alum
inum wire. He controverted the idea
that the life of aluminum wire was lim
ited t.i six months. According- to his
figures, the ratio of the expenses of
aluminum and copper wire was as 16
to 21. Professor Corey of the Univer
sity of California was called on and he
declared that from actual experiments
it was proved that the conductivity and
tensile strength of aluminum wire was
greater at the Joints.
The next paper was read by John
Spanish rule a governmental fabric
which would reflect credit on the
American nation. There are possibi
lities for a grand form of govern
ment in the future of Cuba, and the
climatic conditions, although greatly
misunderstood by people who have
never visited the country, are con
ducive to health and industry. Under
the supervision of th^ Americans the
sanitary conditions havr- been bettered
and the death rate from disease nas
decreased ~w per cent in one year. The
unclean state of the island" was due
to the u.tter disregard which the
Spaniards had for any work of a
sanitary nature.
"When 1 first landed on the island I
thought the Cuban a lit person to gov
ern himself, but after a stay of three
daya I became convinced ( ,f my mis
take. It will take years of careful
tuition "and indulgence on the part of
the Americans before these people can
be taught the value of self-govern
ment. When they have acquired the
ability and learned that lesson, then
only will be the proper time for this
ijovrrnment to relinquish its hold on
the island."
Tin- lecturer told of the remarkable im
provement in the postal- service from the
old Spanish regime to American regula
tion, and touched upon the life, char
acteristics and pursuits of the natives.
His lecture was illustrated by stere

by himself while in the service of the
Government. The evening's entertain

CHARGED WITH MURDER.
The Woman Mochel Struck Last Sat
urday Night Has Died of
Eer Injuries.
Th* woman known along the Barbary
Coast as Hose Bradford, who was Injured
by M. J. Mochel. a soldier, in the Campfire
saloon last Saturday night, died at her
residence, 20 Mary Btreet, yesterday after
noon. ThÂ«* charge against Mochel was
changed from assault with a deadly
weapon to murder.
It has been learned that the woman's
. r<--:il nnmi is *' â  ' ' " " - '
she was the wife of a waiter In a Mont
gomery-avenue, concert hall. Mochel met
the woman in the Campfire saloon on
Saturday night. They had a few drinks
together and then became quarrelsome.
Mochel finally struck the woman across
the chest with a bottle, knocking her
senseless. One of the barteuders took
the bottle from the murderous soldier's
hands and broke It across ins tieaa. i n<;
Injured woman wan taken to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
, that she was also bleeding from a wound
, across the face and neck, which could not
' have been inflicted with the bottle. The
supposition is that a knife was used on
; her. When Mrs. Bradford regained enn
' Bciousness she said that the soldier had
1 used no knife, but had simply struck her
with the bottle. Dr. Fitzgibbon. who at
-1 tended her, says that it is unreasonable
1 to BUppose that the wound was inflicted
with :i bottle alone, and dings to the knife
I theory. It is probable that Mochel stabbed
, the woman after she had been rendered
j unconscious by the blow from the bottle.
The victim was about 2S years of age
and well known along the coast. Her
assailant is a private in Company E of
1 the Eighteenth Infantry-

of the popular order and less technical.
His subject was "Electric Lighting vs.
Gas." He said:
"Low rates are always conducive to
largely increased consumption and a
larger output insures reduced cost of
production. A number of electric light
ing companies have been a^ked whether
electric lighting was cheaper than gas
and the genera! response was in favor
fif electricity. The improvements in the
electric service ar<* so marked and rapid
that there is little hope left for the gas
plant as a very profitable competitive
illuminant unless working' arrangements
are made with the opposing company."
THE TIVOLI SHOWS NEW
LIFE IN AN OLD PIECE
By Ash ton Stevens.
THE TlvoH seems to have waked up
to t! c tact that an old comic opera
of i Btablished merit is just as
worthy of cartful production as is
a new piece of unknown value. An
old piece is seldom good for more than
a week's run, and a new one may catch
the crowd and fill the house for a month;
and the producers' efforts are gauged ac
cordingly. This may sound very busi
nesslike and proper, but it is not good
policy. A house like the Tivoli depends
on its regular rather than on its casual
patrons. It is the week in and week out
Tlvolite that has made the little opera
house around the corner a possibility
these last twenty years; and the regular
patron, like the "old .subscriber," doesn't
like to be ignored. The Tivoli became a
habit to him through painstaking per
formances of standard comic operas; he
may nut mind the annual invasion by
grand opera, the frequent lapses into
spectacular vaudeville, but when the old
fashloned gems are given he wants them
Berved up with sunn- decent show of en
thusiasm and appreciation. When you
hear somebody ask. "What's going on in
tlie Tivoli?" and somebody answers, "Oh,
nothing; they are rilling in a week with
the 'Mascot, " it shows that somebody
Is wrong in the scheme of that play
house. There are life and ginger yet in
lots of the old master pieces ll only the
performers will go at them in the riglu
way, and in a well regulated stock or
ganization there is no excuse for a pre
medltated "off week."
This is suggested by "The Brigands,"
which 1 attended last night without much
hope and found to be a good, honest per
formance, in which everybody, from ttiH
stage manager to the calcium smearer, did
notnlng less than the best of which he is
capable. Individual faults there were in
number a (and Individual success, too), but

MAY REVIVE

THIS WINTER
To Merge It With
Burlingame Show.
MANY FAVOR THE PROJECT

ENS INTEREST IN GOLF.
Ladies Representing San Francisco,
Oakland, San Rafael and Bur
lingame Clubs Will Enter
the Competition.
The HorsÃ Show, most brilliant and
fashionable of functions, which has been
allowed to lapse in recent years, may be
revived a pain in November. The marked
success of the outdoor show at Bur
lingame last autumn created a decided
sentiment in favor of its being repeated
this year. There are so many things en
grossing the attention of the Burlingame
Club men that the outdoor show may not
be held. The Independence day holidays
will be crowded with all manner of out
door sports.
These will be hardly a memory before
they will be repeated at Del Monte under
the patronage of the Pacific Coast Pony
and Steeplechase Racing Association. The
programme will be an ambitious one, in
cluding polo, for which Riverside will be
Invited to send a team; pony racing,
pigeon shooting and golf. The meeting
will close August 26. This carries the sea-
Bon on so far as to make it impracticable
to hold the open air show, hence the de
sire to carry it into November and incor
porate it with a big show. There is some
$7000 on hand with which to promote the
show and efforts arc being made to in
duce Henry J. Crocker, president of the
Horse Show Association, to say the word
which would put the machinery for an
exhibition in motion.
The outing of the Pony and Steeplechase
Racing Association at Monterey will ho
brought to a close with a day's racing.

MR. THOMAS EXPLAINS
HIS OFFICIAL ACTS
ACTUATED ONLY BY A SENSE OF
JUSTICE.
Question of Veracity Between Louis
Loupe and Miss Connell as to
the Salary Paid Her by
Himself.
Burt Thomas, Special Agent of Internal
I Revenue, was cross-examined at consid
erable length yesterday by Gavin McNab
of counsel for Weltmrn, the ex-Collector.
i now on trial in the United States District
' Court on charges of embezzlement. He
i admitted having broken open Mr. Wel
burn's desk after Welburn left the office
and having examined his papers, public
I and private, for evidence; also that he
had remarked to Deputy Loupe that some
of the letters would not bear the light of
day.
Mr. McNab asked: "Was it at your sug
: gestion after Dillard had informed you
that he had forged the name of Welburn
to 'these documents which have been in
j troduced in evidence that his salary was
raised from $!k)0 to $1200 per annum?"
Mr. Thomas replied that the increase of
'â  salary of Dillard had not been made at
his suggestion; nor had the dismissal of
Zemansky and Lennon been made at his
I recommendation.
"Did you make a recommendation for
the removal of Dillard for forgery."
i asked McNab.
"I did not." replied Thomas, "because I
| have no proof that he committed forgery.
! The signing of Welburn's name by Diilard
was done at the instigation of Welburn."
"You have no Interest then in the wel
fare of Dillard and Loupe?" was asked.
"If I thought that they were guilty I
I would be here prosecuting them to-day."
was th<: answer of the witness.
In response to a question as to whether
his Investigations had been molded by
â¢ Dillard the witness replied that such was
! not â¢ the fact. He had merely done his
: duty without bias or prejudice.
Mrs. H. E. E>riscoll, sister of Miss M.
McCarthy, testilied that Miss McCarthy
died at the witness" home on December 1,
1895. This was to prove that the warrant
1 for Miss McCarthy's services for the
i month of December of that year was
fraudulent and that the money collected
was embezzled by the defendant.
Miss M. E. Connell, stenographer in
Welburn's office for a few months, testi
fied that she had been employed by Louis
Loupe at the rate of $-)0 per month and
i had been paid by him in coin at that rate.
| The vouchers were signed by her in blank
i and she â¢ 1 i cT- not receive, nor had she ex
pected, the larger amounts named in the
vouchers.
Mr. Loupe was recalled and said that
he could not remember whether he paid
I Miss Connell. If he did pay hor, he
! added he got the money from AVelburn
and he gave her all that he had received,
but lie had no recollection of the transac
tions.
The trial will bo resumed this morning.

VOLUNTARILY RAISED
HIS OWN ASSESSMENT
ONE CAPITALIST DID NOT WAIT
FOR THE ASSESSOR TO ACT.
Received a Hint of What Was Com
ing and Jumped His Property
From $100 to
$25,000.
Those men -who have been in the habit
of shirking their responsibilities to the
city and State in the past by concealing
their personal property and paying nomi
nal taxes are not escaping so easily this
year. Assessor Dodge and his deputies
have been going over the assessment rolls
and sworn statements with exceeding
care and have found many Instances
where sworn statements have been tiled
giving the value of the personal property
of attiant as $50, $T."> or $luu when the per
son making the statement was known tÂ»
be worth many thousands of dollars. In
these cases the Assessor will make an
arbitrary assessment and there is no es
, ape from the payment of whatever tax
he sees lit to levy on these shirk* rs.
A few days ago a case was found where
a certain capitalist had his bookkeeper
make out a statement for him, setting
forth his personal property as $1.00 in
value, although lie was known to be
worth a large sum. The local papers pub
lished the fact, but without giving the
capitalist's name, together with th<- state
ment that the Assessor was preparing to
make an arbitrary assessment of ins
property. Assessor Dodge, however, did
ii,Â»t have an opportunity to make his ar
bitrary assessment, for yesterday the
capitalist, without any further notifica
tion than the indefinite reference to him
in the papers, appeared at the Assessor s
office M'th a statement made out by him
self and the total amount of his personal
property was placed at $2. r >.ooo. He paid
his taxes, too, on that amount.
And there are others of similar nature
who are voluntarily coming forward and
acknowledging the ownership of large
property when a few weeks ago they
classed themselves as paupers.
FOR KILLING OF SEALS.
Oil Hunters in Possession of the
Point Arena Rookeries.
Deputy Fish Commissioner Al Wilson
and his assistant, Mr. Greene, the expe
rienced seal hunter, have returned from
the rookeries at Point Arena, where they
went tv kill sea lions during the breeding
season. The rookeries are located upon a
.small island a short distance from the
mainland, and it was believed that at this
place many of the salmon killers cou-ld be
easily destroyed. Upon reaching the place
the representatives of the commission
found that the island was inhabited by a
party of sojil hunters, who are killing "the
beasts for their oH. The hunters at the
present time are killing only the big bulls
of the herds, as these are the fellows that
carry the oil.
On learning the mission of the commis
sion's hunters they begged that the new
arrivals would not begin operations. ;i< it
would interfere with their enterprise. The
sealers promised that as soon as they bad
finished killing the bulls and the season's
work was over they would turn their at
tention to the cows of the herd and kill
as many as they could. This was satis
factory to the deputies and they camo
away. Mr. Wilson states that the herd
is not as large as it used to be on ac
count Of th- indiscriminate shooting by
parties from the mainland driving the !â¢'-.'
beasts away. Where formerly there were
several thousand there are not over 900 or

WINE MEN TO EXHIBIT.
California's Finest to Be Sent to the
Philadelphia Fair.
Them is to be air important meeting of
the large wine producers and, dealers of
California in the office of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association at 3:30
p. m. to-day for the purpose of discussing
the best way of makinp a tine exhibit of
California wines and liquors at the coming
international exposition to be held in Phil
adelphia next fall. J. M. Stauffer, the com
, mlssioner representing the exposition, and
E. Goodwin of the association named have
been at work among the wine men oi the
city and State to get them to eontributs
to the project. Ail stem desirous of so
doing, but it has been decided that .-some
sort of concerted action on their part is
necessary. It will be remembered that at
the present time there are three exposi
tions on the carpet, at Philadelphia, Buf
falo and Paris.
To make exhibits at all three would ho
too great an undertaking for any indi
vidual or firm, hence the proposition of
the wine men to meet with a view cf
making a collective exhibit of the best
goods in their line that the State can pro
duce. Speaking of the movement, Mr.
Goodwin says:
"A canvass of the principal handlers
and dealers in California wines in San
Francisco in regard to an exhibit of this
product at the National Export Exposi
tion at Philadelphia in September next re
veals the fact that a majority of them are
interested in the project and are desirous
of exhibiting their wines at that time, but
quite a number do not see their way clear
tn assume the expense necessary for an
individual exhibit. After consideration of
the situation we believe that the best
means for making an exhibit of California
wines would be through the joint action
of the. principal dealers."
