HOSTILE CRIES IN
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES
PARIS. June ...âThe chamber of
Deputies met at 2 o'clock this after
no., n. The public galleries were crowd
ed with fashionable people, in'-luding
many ladies in pretty toilettes, who
used their fans vigorously on account
of the heat. The galleries of the Sen
ators and diplomats were also full.
There was a large and early ;iti.-n<l
of Deputies who eagerly di*
cussed the situation of yesterday. Pre
mier Dupuy and th< Minister, of Jus
tice, M. Lebret, sat on the ministerial
bench.
M. Laloge. who moved the interpel
lation, rose al L':LT> p. m. and said the
hour of action hud struck. There were
k â¢ heers from the Leftists and murmurs
Irom the Rightists and a babel of fries,
in which MM. Cassaignac and Lasces,
anti-Semite, participated.
M. L,aloge asked the Premier if he

M. Rious de la Gentaye, Conserva
tive, representing the second division
of Dinan, Cotes dv Nord, shouted:
"Loubet 18 not honest; he is a Pana
j maist." This statement called forth
I violent protests and shouts of "order.'
: but M. de la Gentaye persisted, In spite
of the uproar, in declaring honest men
were arrested yesterday. This was fol
lowed by shouts of "Down with Lou
bet," and a scene of wild confusion en
sued. The Leftists shouted at th" top
of their voices: "Expo] M. Rlous de la
Gentaye!"
!''â¢ sident Desfhanol ordered M. de la
â¢ Jentaye to withdraw, but the latter re
fused and the session was suspended,
the Deputies being; requested to with
draw in order that M. de la (lentaye
b^ expelled.
The commanding officer on duty at
the Palais Bourbon threatened the
chamber of Deputies with a squad of
soldiers and requested M. de la Gen
taye to withdraw. The latter waited
until many of his colleagues had left
the house and then rose and walked
out, escorted by the soldiers.
There was cheering and counter
cheering when M. de la Gentaye ap
peared in the corridor. The sitting was '
then resumed. M: la Gone asked what \
measures were to be taken by the Gov
ernment in the future, and the Premier
replied that after yesterday's incidents
his first step was to address a respect- j
ful greeting to the nation's elect and j
to the "firm citizen \vh<> was and who
remains the guaranty of republican
community." (Cheers.)
Continuing the Premier said that!
yesterday at Auteuil the advance |
guard of the reactionary party pro
tested npainst him and called for his
resignation and proceeded to enlarge
upon "the coarseness of such a demon- j
stration against an invited guest." i
(Cheers.)
The Premier then said: "The repre
sentatives of elegance and good taste
have given us an idea of what France
may expect from their idleness and
indolence. We know secret meetings
had taken place and that preparations
were made for demonstrations. We
took measures for the President's pro
tection in driving to and from the race
course, and nothing occurred on the
way â "
Here a Royalist Deputy cried "You
hid him."
M. Dupuy retorted: "No. but your
friends hid behind, the women."
Protests from the Rightists followed,
and M. LaÂ«ios, anti-Semite, cried:
"T.oubet and Delcasse (the Minister of
Foreign Affairs) hid behiD<* noiieeman."
SAX FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, JUKE (>, 1899.
COUNTESS NOT
AMONG RIOTERS
PARIS. June 5. â Count Boni de Castellane has written
a letter to the Echo de Paris denying the statements
of the newspapers ihat the Countess (formerly Anna
Gould of New York) placed herself at the head of the Jeun
nesse Royaliste at the Auteuil demonstration yesterday. The
Count declared that his wife does not belong to the club,
and that she did not leave her seat, from which she could
not oven see what was occurring.
This statement was followed by an ;
uproar lasting several minutes.
When comparative quiet had been re
stored, M. Dupuy said: "We stationed |
police at the paddock with orders to
Intervene immediately in case of a
demonstration, and they did 80, though j
they met with much Opposition and j
protests. I assume all responsibility." ]
"You have the evil eye," fried I^asios,
a remark which caused laughter.
M. Dupuy continued: "All the police
did their duty, rind an individual has
thrown himself on the President of the
republic, who remained calm. The pro
ceedings at Auteuil were all the mure
disgusting because they occurred in the
pr- -sen re of foreign representatives.
Th â  persons who have been arrested
will be examined by a magistrate, who
will decide whether there was a con
spiracy. We are satisfied the accused
are members of clubs which the Gov
ernment has decided to close. Yester
day's demonstrators pretend to repre
sent France in the army, but the public
was against them. We are supporters
of the republic, and republicans do net
mix with those who are only borrowed i
in name in order to better destroy her.
They have given us a countersign we
intend to uphold. If you give us your
confidence we shall know hw to de
fend our institutions from those who
attack them." (Applause.)
Here M. de Cassaignac, Conservative,
interjected: "The country is sick of the
republic. As to the affair which has .
divided the nation and families, It will
yet weigh heavily against you. The

FORT DE FRANCE, via Hay ti, June
s. The French cruiser Sfax, command
ed by Captain Coffinieres de Nordeck,
left here last evening at 10 o'clock for
Devils Island.' The vessel has orders to
take Dreyfus off the island and take
him back to France. The superintend
! ent of the penitentiary will surrender
Dreyfus to the military authorities to
day.
Although the destination of the Sfax
had been kept secret, its departure
caused considerable excitement here,
owing to a rurricr which quickly spread
that the cruiser was going to fetch
Dreyfus.
The prisoner by the verdict of the
Court of Cassation resumes the status
that he held after his arrest and before
â¢ his condemnation by . the court-mar
tial. His wife telegraphed him the good
news of the Court of Cassation's de
cision the day before f yesterday, and at
3 o'clock this afternoon the dispatch
boat Goeland, stationed in the waters
of French Guiana, left Cayenne for
Devils Island, having on board the
superintendent of the penitentiary and

Guiana. ' These officers are delegated by
the French Government ..to. officially
notify Dreyfus of the decision of the
Court of Cassation. ... r

Pio del Pilar.
PROSTRATED BY HEAT
Several Men Lost in Capturing
Minor Places Which Will Have
to Be Abandoned.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The attempt of General Lawton's
punitive expedition to surround and
capture the army of Pio del Pilar,
south of Manila, has failed, the Ta
gallos escaping into the mountains.
The net result of the movement has
been the clearing of natives from a
strip of country which will probably
have to be abandoned to them again,
owing to the American inability to
maintain garrisons, and the loss of a
few men on either side.

Finding there was no opposition,
Colonel Truman crossed the peninsula

WASHINGTON. June 5. â The Navy Department has received ths following cablegram from Admiral
Kautz dated San Francisco, June 3: "The department cable of the 13th instant received. Will instruct the
commander of the Badger to send the Brutus to Honolulu as soon as she can be spared. Expect to sail from
here on the 21st with the remains of Lieutenant Lansdale and Ensign Monaghan. Will probably reach San
Francisco June 25."
This dispatch was evidently brought into San Francisco by steamer and is therefore about three weeks
old. According to Admiral Kautz's programme he is probably now in Honolulu. The run from Honolulu to
oan Francisco is about eight days, so that he will probably be there for some time before sailing for San Fran
cisco, as he makes the date of his arrival there June 25.

BELFAST, June. 5. â There -were exciting scenes here this afternoon
In consequence of the Nationalist demonstration, headed by Wil

play of banners. The Protestants threatened trouble, with the
result that large bodies of police and military were stationed
near where the several conflicts took place, and infantry charged the
crowd with fixed bayonets. Several persons were injured.
The rioting was resumed this evening after the return of the proces
sion. The mobs fusilladed the pi lice wth stones and the troops were
obliged to charge several times. intimately the riot act was read and
a force of fifty policemen batoned the crowd, but they were obliged to
retire before a heavy shower of stones.
A public house was looted and much damage to property was done.
The police havp made many arrests.

Hall's brigade remains in Morong to

Colonel Truman's column, consisting
of the North Dakota Volunteers and
one battalion of the Twelfth Infantry,
captured Binangonan yesterday with

insurgents had a shore battery of two
guns, and these were removed.
Colonel Truman marched across the
peninsula and joined Hall's brigade at
Morong.

INSURRECTION TO BE
CRUSHED BY FORCE
NEW YORK, June s.â The Herald's
"Washington correspondent sends the
following: President Schurman of the
Philippine Commission, in a dispatch to
Secretary Hay. has. it is said, recom
mended more liberal concessions to the
Filipino? with a view to ending the in
surrection at once. An official ac
quainted with the message said it re
viewed the situation on the islands and
was of an encouraging nature.
The dispatch was considered yester
day by the 1 'resident and Secretary-
Hay and the President has sent a re
ply, the nature of the answer is not
divulged. It is significant, however,
that coincident with this message to
Mr. Schurman a cablegram was sent to
General Otis with instructions in line
with the President's belief that the
restoration of peace can be accom
plished only by the complete subjuga
tion of the Filipinos. General Otis will
continue his military operations
throughout the rainy season.
It is apparent the President does not
look for the close of the rebellion until
the Filipinos are convinced of the mili
tary superiority of the United States.
The concessions already offered are
liberal, the administration believes, and
as far as the President can go without
authority from Congress, and it is
doubtful if the new propositions made
by the commission have received his
approval.
OLYMPIA WILL SAIL
FROM HONGKONG TO-DAY
HONGKONG. June 5. â Admiral
Dewey left the Peak Hotel and re
turned to the Olympia yesterday. This
morning he paid farewell calls to the
Governor, General Gasoigne and the
commanders of the warships in the
harbor.
Admiral Dewey's Health has been
considerably benefited by his residence
at the Peak. He has refused all social
invitations and has taken a perfect
rest. He appears somewhat haggard
from the effects of the continual strain
he has been under and of the climate.
The Olympia will sail at 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon, .but Admiral Dewey
will not give a farewell dinner, nor
will he accept one. ft is hoped the
quiet change and the voyage will quite
restore him to health by the time he
roaches New York. The details of the
Ports at which he will call are still un
decided, but it is probable stops will
be made at Singapore and Colombo.
The admiral seems anxious to avoid all
display and merely to seek rest. His
officers and crew are elated at the pros
pect of a return home-
PARIS IN AN UPROAR
OVER DREYFUS CASE
(""ontinued from First Page.
I claimed the Premier, "Is required to
do what we propose.".
"To drag before a high court," re
torted M. Cassaignac (the former Minis
ter of War), "your former colleague.
You. have cause to close the clubs, for
i the natic-n is awakening and is only
awaiting the right man." (Applause.)
After further debate M. Meline and
his supporters moved the order of the
day, approving of the Government's
1 action. The order of the day was car
ried without â  division after the .;.n>*Â»t
part had been adopted by a rote of ."0 5
to 32, and the second part had been
voted by 326 to 123.
Prior to the vote being taken M.
Denys Cochin, Conservative, asked i
that the letter of the Government de
manding the prosecution of General
Mercier should be communicated to the
house.
'I he Premier replied that it saddened
him to take the steps deemed noces
rary. and explained that the trial of
M. Deroulede was not conducted in a I
seeming manner, instancing the fact
that M. Deroulede -was permitted to
pronounce a long diatribe against
President Loubet in regard to the ver
dict of the Court of Cassation, which
showed that some persons had incurred
responsibilities which must be ex
: plained. ,
First there was the case of Dv Paty
de Clam, and then the communication
of the secret documents of the court
martial having been attributed to Gen
eral Mercier, and the Government be
lieved it to be its duty to ask the
Chamber to say if the prosecution
should be undertaken. (Great excite
ment and applause from Leftists.)
The vote was then taken. A heated
discussion afterward occurred over the
prosecution of General Mercier, in the
midst of which M. Lasces suggested
the impeachment of the Premier and
violently criticized those who were
"persecuting" General Mercier, which,
the Deputy declared, was a maneuver
made to influence the court-martial at
K<-nnes.
Finally the Chamber voted to ad
journ the appointment of the Commis
sion, of Inquiry into the conduct of
General Mercier until after the court
" martial at Rennes.
The Leftists made demands that the
verdict of the Court of Cassation be
placarded everywhere In France, and
M. Jourde, Socialist, rose and admitted
he had been mistaken about the Drey
fus affair and had reparation to m.ake.
He added that he was surprised that
M. Cavaignac had not preceded him
to the tribune, which caused the lat
ter to say: "I have already made re
paration by discovering and making
known the error committed."
M. Rrisson said: "The Cabinet I pre
sided over was unfortunate enough to
cause to be placarded a speech contain
ing misstateme'hts. I ask the Chamber
to vote the placarding of the verdict
of the Court of Cassation."
The Premier did not oppose the
placarding of the verdict, which was
i adopted by a vote of 317 to 212.
The House then adjourned.
The Socialist and Radical Deputies
; in the lobbies of the Chamber eagerly
< discussed the measures' adopted by the
i Cabinet and criticized them as made!
-! quate. They demand the closing of all
' royalist clubs.
The division with reference to Gen
eral Mercier caused great surprise.
The Republican Deputies of all
shades of opinion have sent President
L,oubet an address assuring him of
their respectful esteem and of their de
votion to republican institutions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1899.
DISEASED MEAT
SENT TO MARKET
Tomales Farmer Under
Suspicion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOMALES. June s.â For several months '
it has been pretty generally known that ,
diseased beef was being shipped out of I
Marln County to San Francisco, and thu
health officials have been vigorously en
deavoring to detect and punish some of
fenders in order that others might profit
by the experience and cease a practice
injurious not only to the public health '
but to the good name and the business '
welfare of Marin County. It is now al- I
leged that John Carter, a farmer living j
near Tomales, has been detected shipping '
diseased beef to San Francisco. Dr. Ur- j
ban. the county veterinary surgeon, is ;
authority for the statement that if the j
case can be proved Carter will be prose
! cuted to the full extent of the law.
On May 22 last Dr. Urban learned that j
Carter had slaughtered a cow afflicted
with jnilk fever and intended to send the i
meat to a San Francisco firm. Going to
the farmer's ranch, be condemned the '
meat alter an investigation, telling Carter
It migrtit be used for chicken teed or for;

The farmer said lie had no desire to vio- '
late the sanitary laws a^id would feed the
meat to his eh'iekens instead of sending
it to San Francisco.
Freight may be shipped over the line j
i of the North Pacific (.oast Railroad on :
â  three weekdaysâ Mondays. Wednesdays
and Saturdays. As May 22 fell on Mon- ;
' day. the meat could not be shipped on
I Tuesday. May 23. On Wednesday, May 24,
however. Carter himself shipped the meat
; of one cow to Kahn. Lev! & Co. at San
Francisco. Not only was this true, but in- .
1 stead of bringing ihe meat into Tomales. j
where Dr. Urban lives, it was taken in a
' wagon all the way to Point Reyes 9ta- !
â  tion and shipped from that point. This
fact is proved by the way bill.
The affair soon became public property
and has created a good deal of unfavor- '
able comment. When the facts were call
: ed to Dr. Urban's attention this evening,
i he said:
"Mr. Carter promised me not to sell the ;
< meat of the cow after it had been con
i demned. I shall make an Investigation
i at once and if the facts are as stated, he
i is the very man we shall make an ex

| procession of Senati-rs, Deputies, diplo
mats, officers and high functionaries.
The Prefect of Police. M. Blanc, has
ordered the inclosure of the Auto-mobile
; Club de France, of which the Comte de
Dion, who was one of the ringleaders
at Auteuil yesterday, is president. A
police commissary thereupon proceeded
to the club's premises on the Place de
la Concorde and cleared the members
out. after which he affixed seals to the
doors. Vigorous measures have been
taken to suppress demonstrations.
Mounted delegations of Republican
Guards have been stationed about the
Place de la Concorde, in the Rue de
l'Klvsee and in the Rue dcs Tuileries.
The Municipal council this gye^'as
discussed the Auteuil artair, and M.
Blanc, Prefect of Police, announced
that fifty of those under arrest would
be prosecuted for insulting the Presi
dent. He animadverted severely upon
the cowardice of Count Christiani, who
now pretends that he struck the Presi
dent by accident in his attempt to es
cape from the melee.
The Council unanimously adopted a
resolution expressing its abhorrence to
the insulting demonstration and its re
spectful sympathy with and confidence
in M. Loubet.
Lieutenant Guolard has been arrest
ed and charged not only with uttering
seditious cries, but with assaulting M.
Louny, chief of the municipal police.
M. Emile Zola arrived in Paris from
London last evening, but refused to see
anybody excepting his intimate friends.
There is no excitement in the street
where he resides, the Rue de Brux

BULLET SPED TO
AVENGE A WRONG
San Jose Gardener At
tempts Murder.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 5.â attempted mur
der, followed by suicide, was made by
Paulo Arata, a vegetable gardener, in the
office of the St. Charles Hotel,' on Nor"th
Market street, this afternoon. As. a result
the body of Arata is lying on a slab in
the Morgue, and Captain E. G. Zeiro, a
prominent member of the Italian colony,
is suffering from a pistol wound In the
jaw. How . Zeiro escaped instant death
is hard to understand
The attempted murder and self true- j
tion were premeditated and grew out of !
a money transaction. Arata was formerly
a vegetable dealer at Los Gatos and New
Almadtn. He claimed that nine years ago
he entrusted $900 to Zeiro for investment.
The latter' never returned the money, al- |
though he had repeatedly asked for it.
A few months ago Arata, vno was suf
fering from consumption, moved into
town and with his wife and children lived
at '', Cahlll street, near the narrow-gauge
depot. Since then he had haunted Zeiro's
office and demanded the money. ' : . .
To-day Arata walked into Zelro's office.
Zeiro was at his desk. Arata. again de
nial ded his money. As Zeiro closed his
desk and was about to leave the room j
Arata drew i pistol and thr&itauedj to
kill him. Zeiro grappled with" liis assail
ant. The weapon, a 44-caliber British
bulld< g, was discharged, the ball enter
ing 'he right Jiide of Zeiro's face i lit front
of the lobe of the ear, and, glancing down
ward, fractured the jaw. Th^ man fell
and then arose and ?us?.ied irto the street,
bleeding profusely. Arata then swallowed
some poison and sat down to await death.
The police found him seated in a chair.
He was in a stupor and refused to talk.
Arata was removed to the Receiving Hos
pital and on the way there attempted to
swallow the remaining contents of a vial.
He sank into unconsciousness and died an
hour later.
A search of Arata's pockets revealed a
memorandum book, containing the follow
ing short statement, showing the tragedy
had been planned: â¢
"He having- ruined me in health and
money, 1 thought it better for both La
go."
Arata was a native of Italy and about
43 years of age. An inquest will be held
to-morrow.
Zeiro is one of the most' prominent Ital
ians in the county. He is captain of ihc
San Jose Hussars.
The condition of Zeiro to-night is seri
ous. The bullet did not lodge under the
skin, but penetrated the head two inches
and lodged under the brain.

JEFFRIES SAYS
THERE SHALL BE
NO "LOAFING"
He Will Cut Out a Fast Pace if
Fitzsimmons Does Not
Do So,
NEW YORK. June s.â There was plenty j
of activity In Fitzslmmons' training quar- i
ters at Bath Beach to-day. The champion j
| got into his exercising stride unusually
, early, going for a bicycle ride at 7:30
j o'clock and covering a lot of ground on
| the trip. "Fitz" is a great lover of the
j wheel and he gives bicycling considerable
< time in his daily exercise. During his
i spin on the wheel he frequently reaches'
; a high pitch of. racing speed, and as a
: result he was dripping with perspiration
I when he returned to his training quarters
j at 9 o'clock. He was not in the least dis
tressed, however. After a refreshing rub
down he paid a visit to the gymnasium,
where he punched the bag.
Unlike Jeffries, Fitzsimmons sparred
; lightly at the ball. He hit more with the
i purpose of developing his hitting power.
; Fitzsimmons- is a past master Jn the art
I of bag-punching, and those whcTwitnessed
i the champion amuse himself with the
leathern sphere enjoyed the exhibition
I very much. An hour and a half was
â  given to this exercise by Fitzsimmons.
: His wind at the conclusion of the exhi
bition was excellent, showing that in that
' respect he is as good as he ever was in
; his life. Fitzsimmons' speed while he en
j gaged' in his bag-punching work was up
i to his usual standard of excellence.
A brief loafing spell followed the gyrff-
Lr.asium exercises, after which the eham
i pion ate a hearty dinner. This over, he
I swung himself into a hammock and took
' things easy until 2:30 o'clock, when he
1 had spirited boxing bouts with "Jack"
: Everhardt and "Jack " Kenny. Fitz
1 kept his sparring partners busy. He kept
1 them hustling, fighting all the while, and
when they tried to let up he prodded them
Ito renewed energy. Fitz' hands moved
1 fast the while. His footwork was very
pretty, as was his dodging. When the
' beys pulled off their gloves at 3 o'clock,
Fitz said he thought he had done enough
work, and he loafed around for the re
' mainder of the day.
Fitzsimmons claims that he is as good
: a fighter to-day as ever, and that his ln
: activity for two years has by no means
, affected his speed or hitting qualities is
admitted by all good judges who have
j seen him training.
Sparring was the principal feature of
Jeffries' training to-day. The Califor
nian boxed eleven rounds in all, five with
"Tommy" Ryan, three with "Jim" Daly
i and a Tike number with "Jack" Jeffries,
i The bout between Ryan and Jeffries was
: the most liyely of the series. It was full
of fast exchanges, wilh Ryan righting
hard during the entire fifteen minutes
they were in the ring. Ryan devoted con
; siderable time to feinting, but Jeffries
J made no false moves while Ryan was
trying to draw him out.
fn fact Jeffries behaved better than at
; any time since he has been at Asbury
' Park and hf- showed better foot work and
more speed than ever with his hands. He
blocked beautifully at times and sur
prised Ryan on more than one occasion
Iby cleverly parrying blows aimed at a
PUBS DRAFTED
TO PREVENT WAR
Arbitration Committee
Is at Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE. June s.â The arbitration
committee of the Peace Conference held
a meeting to-day under the chairman
ship of M. Leon Bourgeois. Andrew D.
White, head of the United States dele
gation: Sir Julian Paunce-fote. head of the
British delegation, and ML de Staal. head
of the Russian delegation, with all the
members of the committee, were present.
After M. Bourgeois had made a sympa-
I thetic reference to the death of Miss
i Roth, daughter of Dr. Roth, head of the
I Swiss delegation, who was killed in a
I railway accident last Thursday at Flush
: ing, the secretary of the drafting com
i mittee read th/> draft scheme of media
i tlon it had under consideration.
Articles 1 and 2 are declaratoryâ to the
effect that the signatory powers in order
to prevent a recourse to force have agreed
to effect pacific solutions of differences
! and will, except in exceptional circum
stances, before an appeal to force have
recourse to the mediation of one or more
friendly powers.
Article 3 declares: "Independently of a
recourse to such amicable means, the sig
i natories deem it expedient that one or
' more powers not concerned in the con
flict should of its or their own initiative,
and so far as circumstances will permit.
I lend Its good offices or mediation to the
I states al variance. The right to offer
| good offices of mediation belongs to pow
ers not concerned in ifie conflict, even
during trie course of actual hostilities;
and the exercise of this right can never
be considered by the parties at variance
as an unfriendly act.'"
Article 4 provides that the role of med
iator shall consist in the reconciliation
of conflicting classes and the allaying of
bitterness between states at variance.
Article 5. defining the limitation of the
functions of a mediator, says these shall
cease on the moment it Is stated by one
of the parties to the dispute or by the
mediator that the arrangements or the
basis of a friendly understanding proposed
by him is not accepted.
Article 6 says that the good offices con
templated, either at the Instance of the
parties at variance or In th.c initiative of
uninvolveo powers are exclusively of the
character of- friendly counsel.
Article 7 asserts: "Acceptance of media
tion cannot have the effect, except by
virtue of a convention to the contrary,
of Interrupting or retarding or hampering
mobilization or other preparations for
war. If mediation intervenes after the
opening of hostilities it shall not inter
rupt, except by virtue of a convention to
the contrary, military* operations In
course of execution."
Article 8 says: "The signatories are in
accord to recommend, in all circumstances
permitting it, special mediation in the
following form: In the event of grave
differences threatening peace the states
at variance shall choose respectively a
power to which each shall confide the
mission of entering into deliberations with
the power chosen by the other side, in
order to prevent a rupture of friendly
relations. During the currency of their
mandate, which, except in the event of a
stipulation to the contrary, shall not ex
ceed thirty days, the question in dispute
shall be considered as referred exclusively
to those powers. They shall apply all
efforts to settle the dispute, and in the
event of an actual rupture of friendly re
lations shall remain charged with .the
mission of taking advantage of every oc-
The draft was adopted without, modifi
cation, although the committee stipulated
that it should be subject to modifications
at the second reading.

contest, in order to give the well known
expert an opportunity to Judge his ability
for taking punishment. Jeffries made
Ryan come in and smash him hard on
the body and head. Ryan did so and
Jeffries never flinched through it^a.. â
In the bout with his brother JacK,
Jeffries left openings -the jaw^pur
posely and instructed his brother to
smash him with all possible force on the
point mentioned. "Jack" followed in
structions to. the latter, but failed to
make an impression on Jims head.
Although each of Jeffries sparring
partners were distressed at the conclu
sion of his bout. Jeffries did not show the
least bit of distress when he took off the
gloves. Picking up the medicine ball, he
tossed it about for fully half an hour.
When he stopped work his wind was al
most as good as when he started, ana
this In spite of the fact that he prefaced
the sparring bouts with a four-mile jog
on the road. For several minutes after
he stopped exercising with the medicine
ball he conversed with friends, and the
absence of .any distress on his part oc
casioned comment from all. He then re
ceived a good, hard rub-down, and. join
ing his friends, talked with them about
the coming contest. â  .
Jeffries made one significant statement.
It was this: "I hope that 'Fitz' will be
just as aggressive as he has been with
other men who - faced him in the ring.
He will find me ready for him every time.
There won't be any sprinting on my part.
I want to fight him, and if I have to cut
out the pace myself I will do it. I am a
stronger man than he is and I am willing
to mix it with him from start to finish.
â¢I don't care how long or how short the
fight is, but I hope there will be-plenty of
fighting, and good, hard fighting while it
lasts."
. In the afternoon Jeffries took things
easy.
The question of 'appointing timers for
the club" was considered at a meeting of
the Coney Island Sporting Club directors
to-day. Julian .suggested William Mul
doon, the wrestler, who ' officiated in a
similar capacity at Carson City when
Fitzsimmons and Corbett fought. Brady
protested vigorously against .Muldoon'3
appointment, and Julian said that rather
than have any feeling he would withdraw
Muldoon's name. The club has under con
sideration the names of three prominent
sporting men for the place.
George Siler. who will referee the big
fight, left Chicago for this city to-day.
On his arrival here he probably will visit
the training quarters of the principals
and have a talk with them about the style
of fighting to govern the battle. Slier has
always pursued this policy when officiat
ing as referee of a big fight.
L. M. Houseman will act as timer, for
Fitzsimmons. Jeffries' timer has not yet
been named.' The fight will start prompt
ly at 9:30 o'clock p. m. The club has re
quested the principals to be at the club
house at 9 o'clock, so as to avoid any
delay. ffIDjUPW
LLEWELLYN ON
WITNESS STAND
Major of Rough Riders
for Prosecution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HILLSBORO. N. Mex., June s.â ln the
Fountain murder trial, Major W. H. H.
Llewellyn of Torrey's Rough Riders and
former Speaker of the Territorial House
of Representatives, was put on the wit
ness stand for the prosecution this morn
ing. He directed the investigation of the
Fountain murder case.
"Colonel Fountain was my personal
friend, and I never knew a more affec
| tionate family than his," he said. "I was
! requested to organize a searching party
i and found the abandoned buckboard. We
followed the trail of five horses from
there to Colonel Fountain's last camp,
where we found blood and the prints of a
child's right shoe. We followed the trail
of five horses until it was obliterated by
a herd of Lee's catfle being driven toward
his ranch. On the other side of this herd
was a man riding away very fast. Men
measured boot tracks about the spot
where blood was found. One showed the
bootheel badly run over on one side and
its counterpart was easy to recognize
later when I found it on the adobe roof
of Oliver Lee's house. I also recognized
the track made by William McXew, in
Las Cruces, later, as one about the blood
in camp. In this camp was Colonel Foun- j
tain's valise, containing copies of indict
ments recently found under his prosecu
tion, which had been looked through."
After relating the details of the search
Major Llewellyn said he thought one
horse's track leading away from the scene
of the bloodshed was the same as one go
ing to Lee's ranch.
The Fountain murder trial was delayed
this afternoon and evening by the illness
of Major Llewellyn, who was taken sick
at noon just after the direct examina
tion was finished, and so far he has been
unable to go on the stand. His physician
says the trouble is temporary and that
he will be able to submit to Attorney
Fall's cross-examination to-morrow morn
ing. This feature of the trial has been
looked forward to Since the beginning, Fall
and Llewellyn having been bitter political
enemies for years.
MRS. STANFORD ON
HIGHER EDUCATION
Gives Her Reasons for Limiting the
Women Membership at the
University.
NEW YORK. June 5.â A morning paper
prints the following: Mrs. Jane Stanford,
widow of Senator Stanford, has given her
reasons for wishing to restrict the women
membership of Stanford University to
500. She fixed this maximum number in
her address to the trustees of the uni
versity laet week.
"I am not an opponent of coeducation,"
paid Mrs. Stanford in the interview. "I
believe in higher education of both women
and men. I can readily understand why
women are attracted to Stanford. The
surroundings and atmosphere are whole
some and charming. The university was
founded In memory of our lamented son.
My husband and I wanted it tj# be a model
institution for the higher education of
young men.
"During the year just closed at the uni
versity there were 48rt women students,
almost half of the total attendance. I be
came alarmed. I saw young women from
all over the country at Palo Alto. I did
not wish to say them nay. I admired
their ambition, their character and the
great influence for good of their presence
at the university. But the line had to be
drawn somewhere to prevent the possi
bility, I should say, of the probability of
the character of the university of the in
stitution being changed from what was
originally intended. The university to be
consistent with the idea which led to its
establishment must be the place for
men."
Mrs. Stanford leaves San Francisco to
night for New York, 1 accompanied by
Miss Jennie Flood. Mrs. Stanford will
go direct to London and will make a tour
of the continent. Miss Flood will remain
in New York. Mrs. Stanford expects to
return to California In October.

OMAHA. Neb.. June ."Â».â A special to the
Bee from Cheyenne, Wyo., says: The.
Sheriff's posse, which left Casper yester
day In pursuit of three of the Union Pa-
Yio train robbers, overtook them when
~ irty miles out and was given a severe
m tliack In the fight which followed, the
robbers shooting two of the posse's horses
and stampeding two more.
The posse consisted of Hazen of Con
verse County, Heistand of Natrona
County, Lee Devine, foreman of the "Cy"
outfit, and several others. They followed
the trail of the robbers almost due north
and over high, sandy, rolling prairie. The
bandits I had eaten luncheon at Teapot
Rocks, twenty-five miles from Casper,
â where with field glasses they could see the
country behind them for ten miles, and
probably saw their pursuers approach
ing. They had been following high ridges,
but after leaving Teapot Kocks struck
down a draw to the head of Teapot Creek,
and followed along the creek bottom lor
-MX miles.
At a high cliff of rock the bandits turned
abruptly^ to the left and rode Into the
rocks. They were seen by the posse and
followed closely; one man trailing them
while the others re.de to the side. â¢ With
in 2"" yards of the rocks. Charles Hallaby
and E.?T. Payton were in the lead. Sud
o> nly two shots rang out and Payton's
horse wont down with a bullet through
its heart
The whole posse â â¢mounted and ran
to cover among the rocks. In a few
moments other shut- were fired by the
robbers, but only two shots were fired In
return, as the fugitives were completely
hidden behind rocks, and could not be
sei-n.
A few minutes later J. E. Long of the
K.-se, who had been- me distance be
hind! came up and the robbers put a ball
through his horse lengthwise, and rained
bullets around him like hail. Two more
of thf horses stampeded down a draw to
â  the east, and the posse was considerably
df moralized.
The robbers took advantage of this to
beat a hasty retreat- and as it was too
i!ark to follow them ihe pursuit ceased
till this morning, when the trail was taken
up at the 'head of Dugout Creek, forty
miles north of Casper. Two of the posse
returned to Casper, where reinforcements
were mounted on good horses and imme
diately started out 10 take the trail.
General Manager Dickinson, Superin
tendent Harris, Mr Buckingham of
the Union Pacific, Superintendent Dan
iels and Manager Gentsch of the
Pacific Express, and Special Agent
Vizard of the Union Pacific are at Casper
directing the pursuit. If the robbers suo
ceeded in reaching Hole-in-the-Wall the
fastness will be surround) and a deter
mined effort made to capture them.
At â â¢. scene of the ambush one of the
posses this morning found a shotgun

HAVE ROUNDED
OUT FIFTY YEARS
OF WEDDED LIFE
Judge and Mrs. Joseph Y\. Budd Cele
brate the Golden Anniversary of
Their Marriage.
STOCKTON. June 5.-A half century
ago last '\ ening Jos< pi i ! Budd
and Lucinda M. Ash were married
at the home of the bride's father
in Rock County, "Wisconsin. It was
a simple ceremony, followed by the
old-time wedding feasl and attendant
merry making. To-night the fiftieth an
niversary of that marriage was c< le
brated. Experiences exceptional and
commonplace have come to the bride and
Kr^i'in of thai evening. To few has there
been vouchsafed a more happy rounding
of a half century of wedded life. Full of
years and honors, surrounded by their j
children and a host of friends, they w< â¢â¢â¢
this evening the recipient? of attestations
of regard that moved them deeply. Three
hundred invitations had been sent oui and
those bidden t'> the reception came, in
several Instances, from Eastern States,
from Oregon and from the far-<>ff South
land. Mrs. Fiudd had four sisters pres
ent â Mrs. Jennie James and Mrs Mary
Harris in Janesviiie. w-;-.. and Mr^. I>.
Nathan ami Mrs. A. Ptarkhouse of Ran
Francisco. Ex-Governor James H. HuM.ii
and John E. Budd, with their families, ;
were present to gTeel their parents on
the golden anniversary and other rela
tives of the family traveled far to attend.
Preparations for the auspicious ev< nt
have been under way for several days.
This evening the spacious residence <>:i
North Butter street was decorated and
illuminated in a manner that showed the
guiding hand of the artist. Over the main
entrance of the mansion was the name
"Budd" formed by incandescent tights ot
every hue. supported on either Bide by the
figures "49 99. The electricians did not
stop with the conversion of the â¢ x
of the house into a mass of mellow light,
but trailed the wires in every dir.
making: it appear as though vaiii
Incandescent lights grew ..n th
of each tree and bloomed on the rose
bushes. No place was too remote to hold
a light and they were arranged with an
effect beautiful to behold.
The Interior of the residence also hnd
undergone transformation. Potted flow
ers, tropical ferns and cut Bowers were
there in profusion. The court yard had
t. <â¢<â :; floored and roofed by canvas, mak
ing an excelleni place for dancing. The
large dining-room, with rich cut glass re
flecting back the brilliant light and the
decorations arranged by deft hands, made
a scene of rare beauty. The house is well
arranged for such a gathering, as nearly
all of the rooms on the first floor are
connected, permitting the large company
to Intermingle with freedom.
The evening's programme was distin
guished by its informality. It was an
anniversary reception rather than a gold
en wedding. Mrs. Budd, when asked why
the usual wedding ceremony was n"t per
formed, naively remarked that as one had
held so firmly for fifty years she saw no
occasion to repeat It, especially with the
Judge.
Many guests arrived during the day,
while local recipients of invitations began
to appear shortly before 9 o'clock. Judge I
FILIPINO ACTORS
NOT LABORERS
So the Company Is Now
Permitted to Land.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, June .'..
Mr. -Powderly, Commissioner of Immi
gration, with the approval ol the Seen -
tary of the Treasury, has Issued Instruc
tions to the officials of his service at San
Francisco to land the company of Filipino
actors who have been detained there some
weeks pending a final determination of
the case. In the course of bis letter Mr.
Powderly Bays that the persons who have
a contract with the. Filipinos and who
were instrumental In bringing them to
this country assert that it was their in
tention "to procure the services of na
tives of the Philippine Islands who would
be fair types of the people of that race;
that in addition, they should be compe
tent'to illustrate the domestic life, habits
and customs of their countrymen, and
that they should be actors of Buch recog
nized ability as to enable them to faith
fully portray, as actors, the scenes ana
incidents of life in the Philippines, to sing
the native sont's and dance Hi- native
dances of the Filipinos, and further, to
illustrate the Barnes and festivals which
form a part of their domestic life, and
thai under no circumstances would they

petition with American labor.
Continuing, Mr. Powderly says: The
testimony in this case goes to show that
the appellants are actors and that their
performance was witnessed by one who
testified to that fact. U la true thai
followed other occupations, but that is
also true of many well-known actors in
the United States. The point raised is to
their compensation Ls not material, since
there ls no recognized rule or standard
by which managers of theaters are gov
erned in paying the salaries of actors.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1899.
Budd and his wife received the guests in '
the hallway and impressed upon them I
that the freedom of the house was theirs. \
With the exception of those that went to !
the members of the local bar. the mvi- |
tations were distributed to personal I
friends without regard to station or call- j
ing. One brought from the Old Ladies' I
Home at Temescal Mrs. Frances H. Tay- !
lor. The lady is M years old and baa
Known Lne Budds ever since they arrived
in the State. in the early fifties. . Â
Tne event of the evening was the pres
entation of a rich trlhandled loving cup by
Superior Judge Jones on behalf of the
Stockton bar. Judge Jones felicitated the
couple upon their anniversary. Judge
Jones was once a minister, and was ac
cordingly much "at home" in talking of
the marriage relation. He received in
return remarks from Judge Budd which i
were full of feeling and appreciation of i
the manifestation of regard expressed by i
the gift.
The scene in the parlors as the Judges
were speaking was one well calculated to
arouse the sentimental instincts of be
holders. Retrospectively the mind went
back a half century and considered what
must have been the experiences of the
couple during this long journey together.
By the side of the mother was an. ex-
Governor of the State and another son
who is a regent of the State University.
There were grandchildren of mature years
and other relatives more removed in de
gree. From a humble country lawyerâ
perhaps, to be plain, a "backwoods "law
yer" â the groom had risen to be one of the
foremost jurists of the State, and his wife
a woman of exceptional force and activity
who has not only raised a Governor for
the State but has aided her husband much
in his achievements.
It was plain that the years in their !
passing had dealt lightly with the couple.
They were as active as any one in the
concourse of assembled friends.
Mr. and Mrs. I'.udd are New Yorkers.
Judge Budd was born at Pleasant Valley.
Dutcbess County, on January IS, 1522. and
Miss Ash was born in Herkimer County
on the 19th day of April. 1532. They were
not acquainted with each other in the
Empire State. Mr. Budd left bis home in
Dutchess County to go West and the
year 1848 found him in "Wisconsin just
commencing the practice of law. â  The
same year Mr. and Mrs. Ash moved West
with their family and settled near Mag
nolia, where the young people became ac
quainted and where the wedding cere
mony was performed on June 4, 1849. For
PLAN FOR AN IRISH
NATIONAL PARK
Sons of Erin May Purchase the
Beautiful Lal^es of
Kjllaroey.
NEW YORK, June B.â The beautiful and world-famous Lakes of
Killarney, with their surrounding woods, meadows, hills and valleys,
are for sale .and in peril of becoming private property.
Practically the whole of Killarney district, which is owned by the
Earl of Kenmare and Mr. Herbert of Muekross, has been placed in the
hands of their Dublin solicitors for sale, and already private capital has
been interested in its purchase. In a few weeks the property will be
offered for sale to the highest bidder.
Irish-Americans in Greater New York have been awakened to the
meaning of a private sale of Killarney, and it has been suggested that
Irishmen in this city by popular subscription purchase Killarney, main
tain it as a national park for the people of Ireland and thereby perpet
uate the world-wide interest that has centered about Muekross Abbey,
Dinniss Island, Tore waterfall and the Gap.
â¢ The plan suggested has met pronounced success thus far. Several
prominent Irish-Americans who were interviewed to-night on the subject
expressed themselves strongly in favor of the movement, and the consen
sus of opinion was that there would be no difficulty in raising enough
money to purchase the property to insure its preservation as an Irish
national park. It is said that the portion of the beautiful lake district
offered for sale embraces about 13,000 acres, which may be bought for
$150,000.
Mr. Powderly has secured a pledge from
the persons bringing the company over
that they will execute a new contract
with the Filipinos which will provide that
"their services shall be now only for the
purpose of exhibiting the songs, fiances,
games and plays of the said islands; that
they will causethemto be supported, main
tained, clothed, fed, lodged and supplied
with medical attention when required, so
long as they remain in the United States,
and they shall not require them to do any
other labor or service than above specl
nine years Mr. and Mrs. Budd resided at
Janesville, Wis., where their elder son,
ex-Governor James H. Budd, was born on
May 18, ISSI. and John E. Budd, their
other son. was born two years and three
months later.
In July, 1858, Mr. Budd came to Cali
fornia, his wife following him five, months
later with the two boys, then 5 and 7
years of age respectively. They lived
awhile at Sacramento and later for a
.short time at Wood bridge, In this county.
In 1860 the family moved to Stockton.
Judge Budd. though approaching 7S years
of age, has a brother and two sisters still
living, but they are in New York and
were not able to be present.
Throughout the evening Steele's Or
chestra discoursed music. The older peo
ple contented themselves with social in
tercourse over cards, while those fond of
the waltz enjoyed themselves on the
dancing floor. . The refreshments were
served in bewildering abundance and
variety.
On Wednesday Judge and Mrs. Budd
will leave for a short tripâ their second
honeymoon going lirst to San Francisco
for a brief visit and later to the seaside.

CONVENTION TO
FIGHT TRUSTS
Call Issued by Governor
of Texas.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex.. June s.â Governor Jo- !
sc-ph D. Sayers to-day issued a call for
a convention of the Governors and At
torney Generais of the several States ' ,
and Territories to consider anti-trust ]
legislation, to meet in St. Louis on Sep
tember 20. It was originally intended
to set the date for about July 25, but
advices were received from a number
of interested parties that a larger at- â 
tendance would be obtained by holding
the convention some time in Septem
ber.
While the announced object of the I
convention is to uiscuss and formulate j !
some concerted plan o" campaign
against the trust:;, th- 1 gathering will
definitely determine whether or not the
anti-trust question is to be made a na
tional political issue by the Democrat- j
lc party. The invitation of Governor
Sayers is extended alike to Republican
and Democratic Governors and Attor
| ney Generals. If the Republicans do
not respond to the call the Democrats
will take it to mean that the repre
sentatives of that party are not in
sympathy with the movement. The
call is as follows:
AUSTIN, Tex.. June 5, ISW.
Dear Sir: After much reflection I con
cluded that it would not bo improper for

â  ernors and Attorney Generals of the sev
eral States and Territories he held to
consider the effect which the formation of
mists Is having upon the country, and if,
; possible to agree upon a character of '
legislation that will not. only force those
i now existing into dissolution, but will
also prevent their further creation. I am
i firmly of the opinion, if as many as
twenty States can he induced tn adopt a
uniform policy in reference to this peiier
ally admitted evil and will enforce such !
policy with firmness, impartiality and :
vigor, relief will surely and quickly fol
low. It cannot be doubted that tn this
matter State action is necessary and that
uniformity in the enactment and enforce
: ment of legislation Is indispensable. I have
therefore to respectfully suggest to your
Excellency and to the Attorney General
of your State that a conference to con
sist of the Governors and Attorney Gen
erals of such States and Territories as
may see proper to attend be held at St. ;
! I.*<uis on Wednesday, the 20th day of Sep- ;
tember, ISO 9, for the purpose of taking
such action as may he deemed proper re
specting the subject matter of this com- ;
munication.
An early reply advising me of your
views and intentions is requested. I have i
1 the honor to be very respectfully your ;
i obedient servant,
JOSEPH D. SAVERS.
Governor of Texas.
Speaking in reference to the pro
posed conference. Governor Sayers
said to-day:
It is my desire that the Governors and

CHRISTIANIA, June s.â According to a dispatch from Mandal, the
most southern town of Norway, two boys on May 14 found on the north
coast of Iceland a small cork case containing a slip of paper dated July
11, 1597, signed "Andree, Strindberg and Fraenckel." and bearing the

URGES REWARD
FOR KITCHENER
Balfour Defends Acts of
the Sirdar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON*. June s.â Lord Kitchener of
Khartoum. Sirdar of the Egyptian forces,
arrived here to-day and called upon A. J.
Balfqur, First Lord of the Treasury and
the leader in the House of Commons, with
Whom he had a long interview. .
Mr. Balfour, late in the day in introduc
ing the vote of Â£30.000 ((150,000) for Lord
Kitchener in tho House of Commons, said
that the fact that the power of Mahdism
w;is crushed was due to the genius of the j
man they desired to honor and reward.
He expressed the hope that those who ob-
Jected to the policy of the Soudan ad-'
vance would not think that a reason fur
resisting the vote, as such a course would
be Introducing politics Into military mat
ters. He then dwelt with admiration on
tho way the Sirdar had surmounted dif
ficulties and organised victories, and by
"his unswerving and almost superhuman
industry," deserved a signal murk of
gratitude and honor, and he. Mr. Balfour.
believed that in proposing the vote of
Â£30,000 he was only carrying out the
wishes of the House and of the country.
Sir Henry Campbell-Banner man, the op
position leader, cordially supported the
motion, while expressing regret at the
treatment of the Mahdi'B body, which he
regarded as an error of taste aaid judg-
Jlr Balfour did not reffr to the incident
of the Mahdi's head excepting Indirectly,
when he said he conceived that there was
only one question before the House,
namely-military merit. Mr. Balfour
added that the country whose army con
cerned itself with politics was on the
verge of military despotism.
John Morley, former Liberal Chief Sec
retary for Ireland, opposed the vote on
the ground of the treatment of the
Mahdi'a head, to which Mr. Balfour re
plied thai he did not believe the element
of vengeance had Influenced General
Kitchener in the smallest degree, pointing
out that he had treated the Mahdi s fam
' lly with the utmost consideration. It was
the tir-n duty of the man responsible for
the safety of the men and officers left In
charge of nmdurman to root out the
fanatiaal superstition which had been the
strength of Mahdism for years. Mr. Bal
!-,....â  Â«LdÂ«mitted niiÂ»Â«vr. â¢Â»Â».-.Â« porliai"-- the

MATRIMONIAL KNOT
MADE DOUBLY SECURE
Secret Wedding of Sacramento Couple
Followed by a Marriage in
Public.
"WOODLAND, June s.â On March 8 of
this year a marriage license was issued
in this county to Rudolph Bernard Brun
ner and Helena Gropp, both residents of
Sacramento. Mr. Brunner and Miss
Gropp visited the Clerk's office together
to procure the license, and on the follow
ing day they were married in Washing
ton by Justice of the Peace Gill. The
witnesses were C. A. Elliott of Sacra
mento and Mrs. C. H. Brown of Wash
ington. The marriage certificate was re
corded on April 7 at the request of Judge
C* ill
This quiet wedding is a cause of much
surprise. The young couple were known
to be engaged, and preparations were then
under way to have the marriage cere
mony celebated at a later date in Sacra
mento with more than ordinary pomp.
For some unexplained reason Mr. and
Mrs Brunner said nothing about the loin
County marriage, and the parents of the
voting woman continued their efforts to
ward making her wedding an elaborate
one. However, the suspicions of some
friends were aroused and several inquiries
have reached this city concerning the
couple's the unconventional wedding did
That thr unconventional wedding did
not interfere with the other is shown by
the following extract from the Record-
Union:
Rudolph B. Brunner and Helena Gropp r were
married Sunday at noon in the German Luth
eran Church by Rev. Charles P. Oehler. The
ceremony was witnessed by a large number of
relatives and invited friends. The notable
feature of the church decorations was a floral
arch overhung with a large basket of flowers.
The wedding party immediately proceeded to
Turner Hall, where all, including guests to
the number of over 200, sat down at five lone
tables to partake of a wedding dinner. Chris
AVelsel acted as master of the feast. Mrs.
Otto Wllhelm rendered a couple of vocal solos,
German love songs, and also led the male choir
of some twenty members, which gave a num
ber of selections in German. The newiv wedded
pair received an unusually large number of
valuable gifts. They took the 5 o'clock train
for San Francisco. Their home will be at
Uklah, Mendocirro County.

although strict measures were adopted
to check it. Now it has spread among the
people of Mission San Jose and the sur
rounding country. Dr. Emerson, the
Health Officer of the township, has placed
in strict quarantine all of the cases.

Men and women who have sunken so
far into weakness and disease that the
whole body seems to be permeated and

thirty years ago, to sick and suffering hu-
manity.
During all the years since then this mar-
velous " Discovery " has been building up
weak and debilitated constitutions by its
extraordinary influence upon the human,
nutritive system. It gives the digestive or-

BARYTONE SCORES
A TRIUMPH FOR
THE LAMBARDIS
Individual Virtues but
Bad Ensemble.
MISS JOHNSTONE BENNETT
COLUMBIA'S NEW PLAY PRO
DUCED BUT UNNAMED.
"Pagliacci*' and "ThÂ« Pirates" at j
The Grand and the Tivoli
Singers in "The Merry
War."
The Lambardi Italian Grand Opera
Company from Milan, by way of South
America. Mexico and Los Angeles,
opened to a snug house in the Call
fnruia Theater last night, and in the
reliable double bill of "Pagllaccl" and
"Cavallerta RustJcana" soon made
friends with the audience, in which the
local Italian colony was well repre
sented. The encore fiend and his loud,
stout hand were there in noisy num
bers, and several incongruous en
wer? accepted by th-* willing singers.
Altogether the night came off with a
great deal of hurrah; nobody seemed
to expect too much oÂ£ an organization
that had been so mild in its promises;
individual faults and failures were re
ceived good naturedly, and all that was
good was greeted enthusiastically by
hands, feet and mouth.
The best of the pood was contributed
by Salassa, the barytone, in the part
of Tonio in the "Pagliacei." At the
first note the crowd knew him for an
artist, and if ever an encore be pardon
able in opera certainly his was in the
"prologue." Salassa's singing of this
resourceful pong was nothing short of
â rly. His voice is big. rich and
wide, strenuously masculine and firm
In all its scale; and the way he sent it
out in the "prologue" was an occasion
for cheers. I have heard many bary
tones in this piece, but none better
than Salassa. He would have been
worth his weight in bonds to the Ellis
company. Not only can he ping with
art and distinction and act, but he has
the voice, the big, open, bounding voice
That touches you and triumphs. His
Tonio was a memorable character
throughout.
But the L#amhardis are in it
gas. If they were it would be another
tale â and other prices. The resi are
what a careful man w>uld have ex
pected. Salassa is the surprise And
you will be missing things if you don't
hear him.
A r^nor of admirable intention partly
executed is Av-^dano. Ho plays Canto
in the "Pagliacci" and would act. pas
sionately, and does. His voice falls

still you can admire it for many things,
especially when it is not overleapin
self. It is of the pure Italian quality,
quite sure of the not.-, and Boft and
easy in legato. In the more dramati â 
passages it takes in an emotional qual
ity that is not wholly congenial and
often reveals the machinery of effort.
s Btegni was the Nedda. Sh" re
minded me of a Maude Adams gone
Italian and vocal. ShÂ« has something
of the - â  Ich of face and sh<
slim, girlish and Ingenuous. Like Maude
Adams Bhe BUggests Inexperience. That
Is pan barm. The voic< fits the
nality. It is immature, embar
:. almost, at tim^s; of long rang<
and a reedlike quality that I found
rather fascinating.
Bo much for the principals in "Pag
liacci." The performance as a whole
was not admirable. The orchestra was
bad. atrocious, and the chorus ran it a
clos.- second, and ; ti' stage manage
ment was unmentionable. The play
within a piny was acted out in th"
open instead of in the tinted Stage; and
so far as action was concerned the
chorus might as well have been
painted on the Bcenery. From a pic
torial point, they would have been much
better served up that way. You never
saw such a gallery of service-scarred
Medusas.
"CavaHeria" came second, and the
same general criticism applies, except
that there was no great barytone, and
that the chorus was a little less rigid.
Barduccl was thp Santuzza, and a good
one. Her voice is far from huge, but
it has the dramatic quality and a cer
tain harshness that finds the right vent
in the part. A tall and overposed
young man by the name of Juan Bar
daaoeo played Turridu, and in spite of
diverting mannerisms acquitted hlm
sHf with considerable force. The rest
need not be listed.

nondescript sketch by the name of "A
Quiet Evening at Home" Miss }?"nnetf
personates not less than five listinci
characters. Her changes of costume
and makeup are rapid and surprising,
but her real work on tho stage is not
calculated to set the bay i-burnini?.
In two female characters of the tou^h
variety she employs a certain realism
that is clever technically if not very
amusing or new to her auditors, but
the otht.r lightning changes, that run
from a society woman to a boy about
town, are dull any way you take th. :n.
Antonio Williams is Miss Bennett's un
eventful co-worker. According to thr
programme, it required two authors to
write the sketch, which in itself
amounts to nothing.
The other new teams are out and out
variety, fvnd they seemed to Dle%se
Sunday n'ght's crowd.
Houdini, the police baffler, who es
capes from ail sorts of handcuffs, is
really a wonder, although his feats do
not show up as well on the stage as
they do in private exhibitions; the audi- i
ence is inclined to suspect a hoax. How-:
this young man gets out of the hand- j
cuffs I would not attempt to explain, j
but several hundred spotless policemen
who witnessed Houdini'a exhibition in
the City Prison the other day will bear!

them the merry ha-ha generally.
McAvoy and May dub themselves J
"cyclonic comedians," and are reward

Eva Foster Rigga' new comedy, as yet

audience last night at the Columbia. It
belns Its first appearance on any stage.
While the house was not overflowing, it
Wai select, many prominent citizens and
t!-.Hr wives being seen in the orchestra
and dress circle, but it was not a wildly,
demonstrative house. In fact, it was too
good to be warm, and the first act opened
In a decorous silence that was first cousin
to a frost. But it was impossible to ignore
the good acting and good stage setting,
and by the time "Aunt O'LJne." tho fe
male and the only villain of the play,
came before the footlights, San Francisco
had thawed sufficiently to give her ex
cellent acting a hearty round of
applause. There was another round
or even more liberal applause be
fore the curtain fell at tho end
of the act for Herbert Kelcey nnd
Effle Shannon, who were called thrice be
fore the footlights.
The excellent acting of the principals
bad captured the audience before the end
of the second act, and from that time on
there were little bursts of applause, some
times for the people, sometimes for the
bÂ« enJc effects. Although the piece was
Intended for a comedy, it If idyllic in spots
and moistens the eyes even while it
\\ reathes the lips in smiles.
Before the last :trt the announcement
was made from the stage that of 4000

"Pagliacd" was heard south of Market

last night, and the production at the
Grand Opera-house by the South
well Opera Company was received
with enthusiasm by the audience.
Edith Mason as Nedda scored an artistic
! success, and it can safely be said that
is not been heard to better advan
; tape since the season opened. She was
> in excellent voice and her acting was full
I of tiro and charm in her scones with
Tonio and Canto and tenderness and grace

Canio was one of his best efforts ami he
[ved a curtain cull for his fine- rendi
tion of the closing scene in the first act.
â \\infrod Goff as Tonio surprised his ad
min rs in his Binging of the prologue, and
received five curtain calls. He was in

Nace Bonville as IVppe completed the
excellent cast. "The Pirates of Pen

horrible of all diseases can be cured, i
There is a good deal of controversy over j
this subject among those who declare the
disease incurable, but the facts are in- â 
dubltable and must be acknowledged. The j
action of this new remedy Is peculiar. The |
physician in charge of th<: institute has !
had a long and varied experience treating !
this disease of the blood, and about two ,
years ago, after a long series of experi-
ments, he found the exact specific that
offsets the poison, renders It lifeless and !
eliminates it from the body. Having per- !
sonally examined many hundreds of cases |
and familiarized himself with every de- i
tail of the disease, his discovery came
naturally and has never failed him. One ,
of his recent cures was a most hopeless
case, the disease having caused the hair
to fall out and the body was one mass of :
putrescent sores, bolls, blotches and un- j
sightly disfigurements. In ten days tho |
entire outer skin waa healed and there I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUKE C>, 1899.
INDIANA-STREET
"BONEYARD" GOES
UP IN SMOKE
Fertilizing Works To
tally Consumed.
LOSS ESTIMATED AT $50,000
COSTLY MACHINERY AND OTHER
STOCK IN THE RUINS.
Buildings, Old and Frail, Burn Like
Tinder â Origin of the Fire
Unknown â Partial
Insurance.
The destruction of the fertilizing plant
of Nicholas Ohlandt & Co. on Indiana and
Yolo streets, Potrero, made a lively fire
in the Potrero late last night. The entire
works were destroyed and the loss is es
timated at about $50,000. The origin of
the fire is unknown. For a long time the
blaze gained headway owing to lack of
water, and for hours after the fire had
been got under control grease, fat and
other inflammables blazed and sputtered.
The fire was discovered by the watch- |
man, I^ouls A. Smith. He claims to have !
! been standing at the west end of the
j building when he saw a sheet of fiamo .
; light the promises on the side near the i
1 marsh. He turned in an alarm and with :
other men who soon arrived on the scene
succeeded in liberating the horses from
adjacent stables. In an incredibly short ;
period of time the entire works was on (
; tire and the efforts of the men were turn- .
i ed to saving a stock of explosives which :
were stored in sheds a little distance- off.
The Fire Department was hampered by
the distance of hydrants, and before a
stream of water could be brought to play
on the fire, lines of hose had to be
Stretched over 1600 feet, and then the wa
ter had to be forced through an inter
mediate engine.
The buildings covered considerable area,
and those destroyed belonged to the fer
tilizing' department, engine room and fat
and oil departments. They were com
pletely razed to the ground, and the fire
men consumed several hours in ex
tinguishing the blaze, which had started
In immense iron vessels of fat and oil in
seme of the rooms.
The cause of the fire Is unknown. The
watchman states that he had been
j through the building about half an
! hour before he discovered the con
( flagration and that there was no
fire then. The workingmen leave th.>
| place at 5:30 in the afternoon and at that
' time all the fires are put out. When the
watchman went over the premises he car
ried a lantern. Several people who were
on the street cars saw the flames shoot
| out of the roof, and Bay that it was but
I an instant until the agent of destruction
was Leaping from every part of the struc
tures.
The plant employs about twenty-two ;
men and manufactures bone-black for the â 
sugar refineries, besides large quantities :
of fertilizing material which la shipped to
the interior of the State. The proprietors !
are N. & J. C. Ohlandt. J. A. Â«fc C. H. j
< Buck. The loss will be heavy and has been |
placed at about $50,000. A large stock of
material was on hand and it all became
food for the flames. The loss is only par
tially covered by insurance.
\VHii<r me !ii<r atuLa In rÂ»Â»ero<"> r-<'\-er;il
explosions of nitre occurred in a building
j adjoining the engine room.
The firemen worked hard and saved the '
structure and there was no serious acci
dent.
Hundreds of people in the Potrero gath- i
ered to watch the fire, which was spec
tacular owing to the large* amount of in
flammables which could not readily be
extinguished.
Many of the men employed at the works
have homes in the vicinity and will be
thrown out of employment until the
place can be rebuilt, which will be soon.

COLONEL RAY WILL COMMAND
DEPARTMENT OE ALASKA.
Bver Blnce tho War Department desig
nated the Presidio as the place of rendez
vous for the casuals to be assigned the
various regiments, these "orphans," as
they are called, have been coming to San
Francico from all over tho country. Many
of them have already been assigned to
regiments and sent to tho Philippines, but
even at present there are over 2000 of them
at the Presidio and they arc still coming.
It has been found necessary to put them
Into camp and officers have been appoint
ed to select a site. This camp, with that
which is to be erected for the returning
volunteers, will make, the Presidio look
very much as it did last year. When the
two camps are completed there will be ac
commodations for 7000 men.
Colonel S. H. Hay, who is to commanad
the Department of Alaska, will sail for
the north with his troops about the last
of this month. lie will have his head
quarters at Fort Egbert, about ninety
miles from Dawson. The troops to go are
two companies of the Seventh Infantry
and some others yet to be selected. Their
chief duty will be to preserve law and or

with General Shatter yesterday.
There is hardly any doubt that the

be necessary to do a lot of plumbing on

Telegraph Hill Vendetta.
The vendetta on Telegraph Hill between
the Crofton and Badaracco families bids
fair to be ended through the intervention
ot Judge Tn-adwell. Yesterday morning
Benjamin Badaracco, accompanied by his
son, Paul, called upon the Judge and
was noticeable improvement in all other
respects. A brief continuation of the rem-
edy brought about a radical cure.
The free trial treatment has saved a
great many who otherwise were doomed
to early destruction, and it was this ob-
ject which induced the Institute to make
tho offer. In all cases where the sores
have become characteristic of the disease
the sufferer fully realizes the name and
nature of his or her affliction, but a great
many who have inherited the disease or
who have recently contracted it should
ask the institute for their 44-page book
describing fully the disease and also ex-
plaining the action of their new remedy
SilUide. Send your name and address to
the State Medical Institute, 148 Bass
block. Fort Wayne, Ind., and they will
forward, prepaid, a free trial treatment
that will bring to the sufferer such won-
derful relief, such an ecstatic feeling of
Joy for the improvement shown as to ful-
ly compensate for the suffering and de-
spair that previous failure has caused.

and Jimmy Crofton. The Judge pacified
him, and instructed Bert Wren, his war

when he will make an effort to stop the
vendetta. Badaracco will also be present.

afternoon, and both were compelled to re

short and decisive. Both representatives
of the Health Department were in earn

The trouble had its origin, it is said,
in IFlannigan being brought before the
Board of Health on a charge of having
bitten the thumb of a watchman employed
at the Potrero. As these charges were
brought by Meat Inspector Davis, an in
timate friend of Dockery's, Flannipan.

Inspector had taken a part in the effort

Flannigan and Colonel Brady were in

the coat with both hands and tried to
persuade him to aecompnny him up the

Rev. Dr. Coyle Creates
a Sensation.
TELLS WHY PEWS ARE EMPTY
CRITICIZES YOUNG MINISTERS
WHO DINE OUT.
He Declares That Nobody Embroid
ered Slippers for Simon Peter or
Presented Paul With a
Dressing-Go wn.
Rev. John Coyle. D. D., of Berkeley
created a mild sensation yesterday morn
ing at the weekly meeting of the Method
ist Episcopal Ministers by reading a pa
per on "The Pulpit and the Empty Pew,"
which contained matter of a highly inter
esting, if not sensational character, lie
said:
There are a great many empty pews in
churches of every denomination. he dives,
beer halls. danÂ« halls, theater? and bil
liard rooms do not lack for Sunday con
gregations. There are no empty pews in these
places. Never was the standard of preaching
a? hich as it is to-day Never was there a
better-trained, more hlehly cultured class i>f
men occupying the puloit. What Is the cause
of these empty pews, then? What Is it .
In not a few instances the Inability of a
church to cope with the stupendous Industrial
and social evils of these modern <lnys stands
confessed. The great - ethtng mass of men
no longer inquire what the church s opinion
1Â« upon any of the great and vital questions or
the day, that is. the laboring 'population-the
m w who (Iron the ballots, an.l who make ii: '" 1
unmake laws leaders and political parties, in
prr>of of this assertion our large city churches
are pointed to and the question is tusked,
where are the working men? The greater part
of the male element Is made up of the profes-
Flonal the well-to-do and employing classes.
One is constantly hearing of the richest, the
most aristocratic, the most fashionable churches
of the city. But underneath their arched and
fretted roofs one does not tl: " ! at Sunday wor
ship the my-handed sons of toil. Their ab
sence is not due to perversity of heart, but to
the fact that Door men and women will not
go -where competition in style of dress is
greater than they can meet. You have noticed,
brethren, this condition does not obtain in
Catholic churches.
The preaching of the gospel has become too
mufh a matter of business for what there is
in it and many able preachers only feel called
to h higher salary.
One of the first requisites to do vigorous work
is vigorous health. No athlete of the Roman
arena ever needed better bone or blood, nerve
and sinew than the man who enters the Chris
tian ministry to-day. The day Is passed when
dyspepsia and heavenly mindedness were
synonymous terms. One reason why the
Apostles preached such powerful sermons was
they had plain, wholesome food. These early
ministers were ever invited out to late sup
pers with chicken lad, doughnuts and ice
cream. Nobody embroidered slippers for the big
foot of Simon Peter or presented Paul with a
\ elvet dressing-gown and a gold-headed cane.
These men had vigorous brains because they
hart healthy blood.
OnÂ» of the sad thoughts in connection with
the Christian ministry to-day is that the ranks
are filled with young men who are the sor.s of
poverty, whose training is carried forward
nmil the mnst unfavorable surroundings for
vigorous health. The theological student llvea
at a cheap boarding house, whose bill of fare
is eternally it war with a healthy stomach.
And. after three years of such depletion that
r<~rnes from light feeding and heavy work, he
steps gasping into the pulpit, so heavenly pale
that the mothers of Israel are afraid ihat he
*vj!l evaporate before he goes through his' fir:
.'â¢'-rmon.
Po you suppose that if Paul had passed
through that kind of theological training lie
would have made Felix tremble? One glance |
of th*> old Roman's eye would have made Paul
apologize for his intrusion. To reach the high- '
est success he must have the gift of common
Fense. For lack of this how many men of
splendid gifts and acquirements have mail" a
Miserable failure. I believe there is a solution
and believe the pulpit must solve It

NOVELTIES arp the moving genius of the age. and Tim MrOrath. trainer of pugilists, has hit upon thp latest
and moFt unique materialization of that spirit. He I? now manapnj? ani training a hraoe of red-topped fighters
who arc as d<>af as the man who lacked a money ear. Out at the pavilion along the ocean beach Tim is bavins
bushels of fun with his pugilistic subjects. Wherever you look n shining, refulgent red-top strikes the eye with
dassltng effect and men are plying their fingers in the secret sipns of the dumb language.
MeGrath has three fighter? on his hands at present, all training for the National Club bouts on the l<Uh.
"Dummy" Mike Rowan, who will mingle things with Joe Rea of the Olympic Club; "Red Stack" Franey, who will
meet Charley Ooff. and .Joe Kennedy, who will cross mlts with Oui Ruhlln, are training at the pavilion, and their
daily work furnishes much amusement and laughter fur the crowd of sports who congregate 1n the long hall where
the punching bags tn-;it their incessant tattoo. Rowan has both red hair of the violent shade and ears that have
stopped working; Franey hears well enough, but his birsutic capping is blinding to his brothers in training. Every
other man about the place carries an aureole or an aural defect about his person, and enough pen and pencil talking
goes on to fill books. Mike Rowan of the bad ears is attended by a group of red-haired deaf men. His brother,
who is training with him. possesses the same physical characteristics as the fighter himself; Dan O'Brien, a friend,
Is also deaf, with a head piecp of blazing red; Rollin Wells, another follower of the pugilistic destinies of Rowan,
the principal, is a point or two ahead of the game, for his top-piece is of the^lark order, but his ears are like those of
his friends.
McGrath acts as interpreter to this show of freak fighters. Dressed in a Princeton sweater, the gift of Garret

"Well, what do you think of my brick-top stables?" la his greeting to the visitor. "Ray. if I have this stack
of red chips much longer I'll open a poker game before I get through. An'i the other boys with bad ears are a
noipy lot, only they don't hurt your wicks. I'm going to open a card-writing establishment on Market street. In the
last two weeks I have become an expert penman answering their rjuestions."
ICcGrath's freaks are having a happy time. The d< r" portion of the show receive un-hearing visitors and then
the finger talk be,glns until the trade winds are blown back across the Pacific. Rowan was discovered in Los
Angeles by McGrath and Franey was brought down from Seattle. Franey is the man who -stood up against McCoy

MRS. NEALON'S DEATH.
Succumbs From Nervous Complica-
tions After a Protracted
Illness.
Mrs. Minnie Nealon, wife of rx-Assessor
James C. Nealon. died at her home. 92S
Haight street. late yesterday after
noon. The deceased had been suffering
for a long time from nervous complica
tions, but her family was hopeful that
', she would ultimately recover. In March
last, however, her symptoms grew worse,
and on the recommendation of her physi
cians she underwent a severe operation.
Mrs. Nealon remained at the hospital for
a month and then returned to her home.
The operation gave promise of a favora
ble termination of the trouble, and she
grew steadily bettor until within the last
ten days, when alarming symptoms de
veloped, and she gradually sank to her
last rest.
Mrs. Nealon was a woman of many no
ble traits of character. She had a' host
of friends and was active and influential
in th.- parish of the Sacred Heart, in the
affairs of which she took an absorbing
interest. Three children- Marie G., Mar
garet E. and James Joseph Nealonâ and
her husband survive her. She was horn
in New York and came to California when
quite a girl. The funeral will take place
to-morrow.
TWO CASES OF SMALLPOX.
Nurses Contract the Disease and Will
Be Removed to the Pesthouse.
Two rases of smallpox were reported to
the Board of Health yesterday. The suf
ferers are David Alderman and Oscar
Deckland, the nurses who were in charge
of Roy Winchester, the smallpox patient
who died at th< Mac Lean Hospital some
days ago. Since Winchester's death both
men have been isolated [ n the cottage in
which the death occurred, as it was
feared that they would contract the dis
ease by contagion.
The members of the Hoard of Health
and Supervisor Holland met last evening
and completed arrangements for the care
oi the patients at the Pesthouse. The
new building fust completed will be fitted
up as a hospital ward to-day and to-night
the patients will be removed there and
placed in the care of an immune nurse.
Every precaution known to scienci is
being taken to prevent possible contagion
and the members of the Board of Health
declare that the chances for the spread of
the disease ar< very small indeed.

the tug Fearless under the command of
Harry Marshall backed out from Pacific

Fearless kwo blast?, wanting to take the
Inside course; Captain Marshall replied
with two blasts and then another, which
made Potvin swear, as he then had to go
around the stern of the Fearless. When ;
he was again straightened out the Saus
alito was six lengths ahead. Then Cap
tain Potvin lingled his bell and the en
gines set full speed ahead. The Corcoran j
crawled up inch by inch, and when Al

half a length ahead. As the Corcoran
turned from her course and went up river \
she commenced tooting her whistles and

DEMANDED A FEE FOR
COPY OF A VERDICT
COMPLAINT MADE AGAINST
CORONER'S STENOGRAPHER.
Dr. Hill Says It Is the Custom of the
Office to Charge for Copies of
Inquest Proceedings.
Complaint has been made to Coroner
Hill that the stenographer in his office
demanded a fee of $io for two certified j
copies of the verdict in the inquest held j
on the body of Kdward Carrigan, the
painter who recently met his death by
falling from a scaffolding. The sten- |
ographer. David Wolf, does not deny that
a charge for labor performed was re
quested, but claims that he was only act
ing according to custom in the matter and
In this he is corroborated by Coroner T l i 1 1
himself, who. however, acknowledges that
there is no law compelling the payment of
the fee. The customary charge for a copy
of a verdict 1s $1.
According to Miss Carrigan. a sister of
the deceased, her brother was a member
of Golden Gate Council. Chosen Friends.
When the time came for making proof of
death she was told by the secretary of
the council, M. Boehm, to go to the Cor
oner"s office anil secure a certified copy of
the verdict rendered in the case "ghe
went there last Thursday and Sten
ographer Wolf drew it up and when it. '
was handed to her he told her the fee was
$10. She said she did not have the money !
with her. but would bring it the next day
Wolf said he would trust her. The next
day she went with Boehm to the Coron
ers office to have an alteration made in
the certificate as to the age of the de
ceased, and when that was done Wolf
made a demand for the $1(1. and Boehm
Told Miss Cnrrigan not to pay that
amount, as it was outrageous. The man
-!â¢ ihi- r.fti<.Â« domnnficil file return of the
certificate and threatened to take it from
Boehm. who told him that if he attempt
ed to do it somebody would have to hold
an inquest on one of the two men in the
room, and the man In the office allowed
the two to pass out.
When Wolf was seen regarding the mat
ter he told a somewhat different story, in
which he was corroborated by fiepiitv
Mogan.
"It has been the custom o( the office."
said Wolf, "for years to charge for copies
of verdicts or transcripts of testimony,
ranging from $1 to $5. or more according
to the work done. Miss Carrigan came
in Thursday and requested two copies of
the proceedings in her brother's case.
Thinking that she wanted all the testi
mony for the purpose of getting the in
surance on his life. I told her that the
charge would be $10 for the two copies.
Next day she came In with this man
Boehm. who had told her that the two
copies of the verdict was all that was
necessary. I handed them to her and
said:
â â  "Well, who is going to pay for this?*
"She replied that the taxpayers paid us
for it and that she would not. In this
connection I would say that I was put to

Will Go to the Jury.
A motion requesting- the court to order
a judgment in favor of the defendant in
the case of Frederick Kleehauer against
the Western Fuse and Explosives Com
pany was argued before Judge Dainger
field yesterday. At the close of argument
Judge Daingerfield denied the motion, dis
missed the jury and set the case for this
morning for further hearing.
Divorce Case .After Death.
The judgment and order of the lower
court in the divorce case of Mary E.
Smith against Thomas R. Smith has been
affirmed by the Supreme Court. One of
the features of the contest is that the
plaintiff in the action is dead. She brought
suit on the grounds of cruelty and neglect.
The first was not sustained but the latter
was allowed. \hc wife being awarded two
thirds of the community property and the
husband the remainder. After her death
the husband sought to have the divorce
annulled in order to secure the property
so recently parted with. Upon the refusal
of the lower court to reopen the cas.' an
appeal was tak. n to the higher court,
which, however, refused to disturb the
decision of the lower court.

OUR BROAD-GAUGE GOVERNOR.
IT is the fashion of the press to refer to our present
Governor as a narrow gauge: Some misappre
hension is liable to result from this inference. In
respect to his intellect it is correct. But the road on
which he travels is strictly the broad gauge "that
kadeth to destruction."
The Governor bothers himself very little about the
State Capitol, but seeks and finds variety on the tracks
of the Southern Pacific Company. Just now he is on
his way to Yosemite, and when he enters that valley,
cleft out of solid rock, and observes the exquisite
beauty and purity of the Bridal Veil, the tumultuous
magnificence of â¢ the larger falls and the silent
grandeur of the sentinel mountains that appropriately
typify a broad gauge country, he may perhaps be en
abled for once to comprehend his own littleness. And
if from the top of Clouds' Rest he should look down
perpendicularly for 7000 feet to the smiling landscape
beneath he may succeed in realizing the sensations
of a corrupt politician who foolishly imagines that
he can reach the elysium of ambition by a fatal drop.
He has left behind him the other twin of his heav
enly combination, to work the legislative lead for the
Federal Senatorship during his absence. But he car
ries with him abundant food for reflection. Among
other things, he can go over the long sequence, of his
ointments to determine whether in any given in
stance he has broken the smooth record of his obe
dience to the railroad, and for a moment even pre
tended to renew his allegiance to the people. He
will not discover examples enough of forgetfulness
of his, thralldom to induce more than a temporary dis
gust.
The Call on Sunday last furnished him with some
materials for thought. It had. previously notified the
public that as Ulysses S. Grant was at least tempor
arily out of the way. if the railroad executive could
discover enough votes to elect Daniel M. Burns he
would promptly relieve himself of the personal re
sponsibility of an appointment and discover some
pretext for an extra session, so as to invest his Sen
atorial choice with the additional dignity of having
largely increased the burdens of taxpayers. This con
ditional prediction the Governor resented, and in
proof of its inaccuracy said: "I only need to cite the
incorrect announcements of the executive appoint
ments that paper has made from time to time."
The Governor's statement being absolutely false,
the inference was that he rather intended to convey
the impression that, if possible, he would fulfill our
last qualified prediction. In order that the public
might observe his recklessness, as evidenced by a
most remarkable series of fulfilled announcements, in
its issue of Sunday The Call gave a detailed account
of its principal successes in this department of proph
ecy. Under specific dates and with literal quotations
it proved that in some mysterious way it had sub
stantially anticipated nearly every executive appoint
ment that has been made this year. The list was
formidable and included his private secretary, the
executive secretary, the stenographer, the secretary of
the State Board of Examiners, three members of the
Board of Health, the Warden of San Quentin, the
Registrar of Voters, the Highway Commissioners,
various other officers and two Code Commissioners,
whose appointment, for the moment deferred, will
complete the present list.
As The Call is under the gubernatorial ban its in
formation, apparently marvelous in its verity, must
have been derived from some other source. The
heavenly twin, now momentarily wrenched from his
alter ego, was undoubtedly perplexed and may even
have regretted his premature contradiction of a fact
that no one could know so thoroughly as himself. But
if he will remember that the railroad and Burns arc
one he can easily deduce the conclusion that, except in
such a rare instance as the selection of W. W. Foote
for one of the Paris Commissioners, it was only
necessary to discover whom, the railroad and Burns
wanted for each position, and if there were two or
throe, with whom they had coquetted which of them
was preferred, and the basis for calculation was prac
tically complete.
The Governor has provided for his own Los An
geles force, v. ho were probably, acceptable to the
powers he serves' He has taken care of the friends of
Dan Burns, including legislative voters for that un
speakable aspirant for Senatorial honors. He is giving
the State its "St avowed railroad administration. He
is not our first executive to deceive or betray the
people, and especially the voters who elected him. or
to violate his pledges, but the first whose treachery
has been open and confessed. In the Yosemite Val
ley he will have a fine chance to analyze his own re
vealed character by the study of the mingled ob
stinacy and stupidity of the mule, an animal useful in
its place but unfitted for the higher civilization of ed
ucated quadrupeds
THE CALL AND EXPANSION.
WE print to-day a letter from a valued reader
chiding The Call for its position on imperial
ism.
The rebuke of a friend is kind, and we desire to de
velop his view of the issue which' he joins with us.
He says: "I cannot conceive how any one who is
loyal to the Government of the United States can
antagonize the administration in its efforts to put
down insurrection and those who are waging war
against the old flag that floats, over the Philippine
Islands."
We have not antagonized nor obstructed the ad
ministration in its military operations anywhere. The
Call has in many ways, some known publicly and
some not so known, held up the hands and cheered
the hearts of the soldiers and sailors who fight afar
off and obey orders, as is a soldier's duty.
As for the policy of permanent imperialism, we
indorse the only official utterance of President Mc-
Kinley on that subject. In his message to Congress
one year ago he said: "I speak not of forcible annex
ation, for that, according to our code of morals, would
be criminal aggression." That is an utterance that no
circumstances can change.
We did not take the Philippines by arbitration of
the sword. When the Paris Commission met to ar
range the treaty of peace with Spain all of the Philip
pines except a few localities on Manila Bay were oc
cupied by the natives, who had wrested them from
Spain before our flag went there, and under the law
of nations and by arbitration of the sword they were
the sovereigns of the land as well as the owners in
fee simple of the territory.
We paid Spain twenty millions to relinquish her
sovereignty. There is every evidence that when this
was done it was with the intention on the part of
President McKinley and his administration to treat
the Filipinos as our allies, protect them into full na
tionality and after arranging recoupment of our costs
to withdraw and leave them, with our friendship and
our warning to the world to let them alone, to the
happy realization of the hope of self-government and
independence, for which they had fought Spain for a
century. We have published so much testimony to
show that this was the intended attitude of our Gov
ernment that to repeat it would be tedious. Begin
ning with the President's declaration in his message
of last year, the. evidence accumulates. When the
treaty of Paris was pending before the Senate the
President's personal organ said that Senator Hoar
and those who stood with him were agitated by a
groundless apprehension; that it was not among
the purposes of the administration to hold permanent
ly either Cuba or the Philippines. The same identical
assurance was given to Senators at the White House.
The testimony of a dozen army and navy officers,
among them a brigadier general, all of whom were
present in Manila, is that the Americans began the j
fight and the Filipinos did not. All this we have pub
lished, with the names of the witnesses. Alter the fight
began the President's personal organ, in a double- i
leaded editorial, said: ''We want no more repetitions
of this latest battle of Manila. The people of the
United States have neither the bloodthirstiness nor
the land hunger that will tolerate a war of conquest,
whose battlefields are shambles and whose victories
are butcheries. The conscience of the American peo
ple will not tolerate the slaughter of Filipinos in a
war of conquest. We do not seek their land. We do
not wish to replace the yoke of Spain with one bear
ing the more merciful and just label of the United
States. Let the President announce trrat we have no
intention to annex Asiatic territory and that the
pledge of Congress as to Cuban independence will be
the pledge of the American nation to the Philip
pines."
If our reader, friend and critic can find any opinion
we have uttered in antagonism to the President's of
ficial utterance and to these several expressions of his
personal organ and to the assurances given Senators
at the White House prior to the ratification of the
treaty of Paris we will be glad to have him do so.
Let us turn his attention now to the expressions
of the imperial party which has been manufacturing
a polky and pretending that it is the President's.
General Merritt, in a speech at the New England
dinner in New York last Jamiary, said: "What if ex
pansion is unconstitutional? This republic has out
grown the constitution, and that instrument is no
longer-worth discussing." Does our critic approve of !
that?
Whitelaw Reid, at a speech to the Marquette Club
in Chicago on Lincoln's birthday, said: "It is time to j
teach the American people the absurdity of the state
ment in the Declaration of Independence that govern
ments derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed."
Rev. P. S. Henson of Chicago, in a sermon in favor \
of imperialism and expansion a month ago, said: "As
for the Declaration of Independence and its state
ment that governments derive their just powers from j
the consent of the governed, the devil never invented ,
a mr>-e damnable lie with which to deceive the world."
Abraham Lincoln said: "The doctrine of self-gov
ernment is right, absolutely and eternally right. When
a white man governs himself, that is self-government;
but when he governs himself and also governs an
other man, that is more than self-government â 'that is i
despotism. What I do say is that no man is good
enoi gh to govern another man without that other's
consent. Allow all the governed an equal voice in the
government; that, and that only, is self-government.
Repeal the Declaration of Independence, repeal all
past history, still you cannot repeal human nature.
Let us readopt the Declaration of Independence and
the practices and policy which harmonize with it. Let
every American remember that to violate the Declara
tion of Independence is to trample on the blood of
his fathers and to tear the charter of his own and his
children's liberty."
Docs our friend and critic agree with the imperial
expansionists that the Declaration of Independence is
"a damnable lie." an "absurdity," or does he agree !
with Lincoln?
Does he think President McKinley believes the
"-(.public has outgrown the constitution and that in

FRANCE AND AMERICA.
IN The Call of April 3 and May 12 the decision of
the question of revision in the Dreyfus case by the
Court of Cassation and the grounds that rendered
it inevitable were correctly anticipated. It is satis
factory to observe the rehabilitation of French justice,
under the pressure of full investigation, urged not
merely by the French people, but from every quarter
of the globe. It is, however, unnecessary at this time
further to discuss the probabilities of the future in
reference to this remarkable persecution of an appar
ently innocent man. who for more than four years
has suffered martyrdom through the corruption of the
general staff of the army of France.
But in the history and present aspect of the Drey
fus case there is a lesson for the United States. The
demonstration of the royalists and their confederates
against President Loubet, in which unfortunately the
American wife of a French Count participated, was a
significant evidence of the anomalous condition of a
republic in which church and state are not separated
and where orders of nobility yet survive. It may
have commanded the sympathy of American impe
rialists, but it will receive the stern condemnation of
American citizens who have not "outgrown" their
constitution and reverted to the decaying types of
European government.
The central interest in the drama, however, is that
the mass of the French citizens still possesses a con
science, which, after it has been once roused, is irre
sistible in its influence, and that the absolute necessity
of equality before the law and of the honest adminis
tration of justice is comprehended within the Latin
republic, as it ought to be and as it will be in our
own country. If the sentence against Dreyfus had not
been annulled militarism would have celebrated a
triumph, but the people would have prepared for rev
olution.
The corruptions in the management of the Panama
canal project were a long time before they reached
the surface in France, but when they were clearly
discerned and understood prompt and severe retribu
tion followed. The occasional convictions of munic
ipal boodiers in New York were of small import com
pared with the overwhelming wave of French indigna
tion that sent many of their most conspicuous states
men to destruction. Public opinion in France, unin
formed and fomented by racial and religious preju
! dice?, long failed to discern the cruel and despotic
combination from which Dreyfus suffered. But truth
and justice were not to be permanently asphyxiated, \
and when the infamous record was gradually opened j
to public scrutiny the virtue and the strength even of
an imperfect democracy never rested until revision
was proclaimed.
Imperialistic tendencies in this republic of late have
been too prevalent. They will be restrained in due \
time. The most dangerous evils against which we
have to contend are irregularities in the administra- j
tion of the law and saturated political corruption, of
which the Huntington monopoly has furnished so j
many irritating examples. The American people are
not mercurial. They live under republican institu- j
tions that are not unnaturally connected with an
hereditary aristocracy and under which complete re
ligious liberty prevails. They are the product of the
contributions of the best elements of the Caucasian
race. They are aggressive, rapid and at the same time
methodical and careful in business. .Their confidence
in their civilization and in their Government has been
possibly extreme, and they have passively submitted 1
to an administrative routine that has largely fallen
under unwholesome influences.
But no population in the world is so capable, when ',
the necessity for action is forced home, oÂ£*sweeping
every form of interference with the harmony, with the
integrity and with the efficiency of their political sys
tem out of sight. The embalmed beef investigation ;
may have been a solemn farce. The oppressions of !
our railroad monopolies may have been weakly toler- j
ated. Our local plunderers may have speculated upon |
the continuance of civic apathy. But the indications
on both sides of the American republic point to an
upheaval of the masses, invested with the dignity and
with the power of citizenship, and unless such dan
gerous cabals against our rights, our liberties and our
property as are t3 - pified by Mr. Huntington take
speedy warning the educational example of France i
will be an insignificant circumstance in comparison j
with the hard experience to which they will be sub
jected.
Diplomacy may be a good thing, but San Fran
cisco Police Court tactics can beat it every time. An
international complication threatened to grow out of
the encounter a few days ago in an East street saloon
between United States soldiers and a party of Japan
ese sailors from the training-ship Hiyei. The matter
was brought to the attention of Judge Mogan, who
settled it out of hand and mayhap prevented a pro
longed war by deciding that the Japs, who interfered
where they were not wanted, got what they deserved.
It has long been notorious in this State that "bad
debt" brokers were using the lower courts as ad
juncts to their bureaus. Justice of the Peace A. C. Par
ker of Stockton has taken a step which, if followed by
other Justices throughout the State, will do much to
remedy the evil. He has decided that the "bad debt"
collector hereafter can have no more privileges than
the ordinary citizen, and that when he brings a suit
he must put down the price.
The fruit-growers of the State are evidently taking
C. P. Huntington at his word when he declared that
he was never inspired by any desire to do anything
solely for the public welfare. The fruit-growers have
determined to look after themselves, and are pro
gressing well in the efforts to make their welfare a
matter of serious concern to the railroad magnate.
The Czar's peace conference, designed to bring the
blessings of good will to all the nations, is making
progress. It has with due solemnity agreed that
when armies are engaged in the pastime of killing
each other no explosive bullets may be used. The
Czar shudders at the name of a bomb.
The French have been accused of being a mercurial
people, and, consequently, inconsistent. History proves
juk to the contrary. It shows that when they are
glad, they riot; when they are sad, they riot; and
when they go mad, they keep on rioting.
â¢ Captain John M. Neall has been sentenced by
court-martial to be dismissed from the army. Another
evil victory has been won by Ingleside.
Fitzsimmons is certain of victory and Jeffries is
confident of winning. Nearly everybody else enter
tains a mild hope that they will both be whipped.
The "Man With the Hoe" seems to have jumped
hi 6 job. From all accounts at any rate he is working
overtime on the lecture platform.
The latest is a leather trust. Nobody can say that
it is a soleless corporation. .
EXPANSION AND THE CALL
To the Editor of The Call: As one of the old subscribers of The Call, I feel It
my duty to protest against its stand on the expansion question, and am of the
opinion if you would consult those who are taking your paper a large majority
would take issue with you. I cannot conceive how any one who is loyal to the
Government of the United States can antagonize the administration in its efforts
to put down insurrection and those who are waging war against the old flag that
floats over the Philippine Islands, a territory as much in the possession of the
United States as Alaska. If I understand the spirit of the people who believe in
holding those Islands, as well as all possessions ceded by Spain to the United
States, it is not to seek new fields for expansion but hold what we have ac
quired by the arbitration of the sword and the joint decision of both Govern
ments in the settlement of the question.
As President McKinley has well said â in his noble remarks at the Home
Market Club, Boston, in February last, "the Philippines, like Cuba and Porto
Rico, were Intrusted to our hands by the war, and to that great trust, under
the providence of God and in the name of human progress and civilization, we are
committed. It is a trust from which we r.ill not flinch. The American people
will hold up the hands of their servants at home to whom they commit its
execution, while Dewey and Otis and the brave- men whom they command will
have the support of the country in upholding our flag where it now floats, the
symbol and assurance of liberty and justice." Respectfully.
San Jose, June 1, 1599. WILLIAM ROSS.
WILL IMPROVE
DRYDOCK AT
HUNTERS POINT
To Be Lengthened 160
Feet Shortly.
PLANS NOW BEING PREPARED
IT WILL BE MADE TO ACCOMMO
DATE THE LARGEST VESSELS.
The California Drydock Company Will
Spare No Expense in Order to Make
the Dock the Most Perfect
on This Coast.
The drydock of the California Drydock
Company at Hunters Point is to be en
larged at a great expense. Such is the
Intention of the directors of the company,
and at present engineers are at work upon
the necessary plans. It cannot be said
just when the work will be commenced,
but it is expected that the dock will be
completedâ that is, the addition to itâ
by next summer. The work may begin
within the next two months, but it is
more than probable that it will be delayed
until the winter. It will take at least six
months to accomplish the work that will
be done. The determination of the com
pany to enlarge the dock was brought
about by the fact that vessels are now
being built upon this coast whose dimen
sions will be such that the present dock
at Hunters Point will not be able to ac
commodate them.
At present the dock Is 480 feet long- at
the top, and it is proposed to extend this
length 160 feet, which â¢will make the dock
640 feet long. To do this the company will
have to cut away a solid wail of rock.
While the work is being done vessels will
be able to use the dock just the same, for
the reason tnat the extension to be added
will be begun at the extreme limit and
worked toward the present dock, so that
only a smail wall of rock will have to be
cut away when the extension is ready to
i be added.
At present the dock at Hunters Point
is just larga enough to accommodate such
i vessels as the transports Sheridan and
' Grant. When the extension has been oom
, pleted it will be large enough for the
longest vessels that come to this port.
The improvements that the California
Drydock Company propose to make mean
a great deal to this port in the way of
I helping business. Vessels that formerly
I had to go elsewhere for drydockage will
! find it at HunteTs Point.
AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS.
Preparations to Entertain the Distin
guished Professors From,
the East.
The committee having in charge the en
tertainment of delegates to the con
vention of members of the Associated
I Colleges of Agriculture met yesterday in
i the Chamber of Commerce to report prog
ress. There were present Captain Charles
Nelson, E. Scott, A. Sbarboro, Professor
| M. E. Jaffa, C. F. Adams, H. H. Taylor,
J. A. Fllcher, Prentess Smith and others.
Mr. Smith, who is an active member of
the finance committee, stated that the
banks of this city have subscribed $1300
toward the fund, and Mayor Phelan, the
Board of Trade and the Millbrae Dairy
have added sufficient to make the amount
i $1800 of the . $3000 required. It was con
j eluded that the amount would be easy
I to secure, as there are plenty of public
i spirited land owners who desire to dem
i onstrate to the learned visitors that there
is no end of possibilities for the future
Of the State.
Professor Jaffa and Mr. Scott stated
that Lloyd Tevis of Haggin & Tevis and
J. F. English desire the visitors to go to
the part of the State in which their re
spective lands are located. The former
| have agreed to provide entertainment at
| Bakersiield. and the latter will entertain
> at Bouldin Island. Professor Jaffa said the
! scientists will take a couple of days in
I studying the country along the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers with a view
of learning more of the reclamation prob
lem, and irrigation as well. The latter
question will bo gone intfl thoroughly in
I the southern part of the State. It is be
! lieved that a visit will be paid to the
great sugar beet centers. Professor Jaffa
j is of the opinion that among the impor-
I tant visitors will be Secretary of Agri
-1 culture Wilson.
The report was made by A. Sbarboro
that the Swiss-Italian colony would en
tertain the guests at Asti. The members
of the convention will go to this place as
soon as the convention adjourns, making
at the same time the trip over the Cali
: fornia and Northwest Railroad as guests
i of Manager Foster.
WHEAT STATIONS.
Official Willson Established Seven in
San Joaquin Valley.
Local Forecast Olficial Willson returned
yesterday from the San Joaquin Valley,
| where for the past two weeks he has been
employed In establishing wheat stations
along the line of the Valley road. Seven
stations were equipped with thermometers
and rain gauges, namely: Elmwood. Mer-
I ced, La Grande, Lankersham, Hanford,
| ReedJey and Visalia. Mr. Willson mi
i tended to similarly equip stations at
| Bakerslield, Dewey and Angione, but the
shelters had not been prepared, so he left
I the work to competent men and the three
places will be in operation in a few days.
The importance of these wheat stations
cannot be overestimated, and the Weather
Bureau is deeply grateful to the Valley
road, which has taken th*,> matter in hand.
Reports will now be received daily re
garding the prevailing *weather conditions
i in the various wheat sections during the
i month of June and part of July, and the
knowledge will be found invaluable in
many quarters.
The local weather office is in receipt cf
â  a climatological record of Visalia which
j has been kept by Dan Srowan, a volun-
I tary observer, since 18SS. The record gives
i complete data about the daily atmo
! spheric conditions in that section and in
, eludes the noting of earthquakes, sand
i.and electric storms, besides the minimum
1 and maximum temperatures and the rain
fall for every day during the past eleven
! years. The rainfall is always light in
Visalia. and varies from fc.fil inches in 1893
to 14.19 inches in ISB9. The highest aver
age temperature has been comparatively
uniform at about 75 degrees and the low
est 4S degrees.

THE SOUTHERN LYNCHINGS
Starr King A. M. E. Zlon Church,
SOS Stockton street,
San Francisco, June 4, 1899.
Editor of the San Francisco Call: As I
i have noted with great pleasure, shared in
â  by all the people of my* race whose opin
j ions have been expressed in my presence,
â  the brave and patriotic stand you have
taken In regard to the unfortunate lynch
j Ings which have, from time to time, oc
| curred in various parts of the South, it
seems proper that I should express my
| sincere and earnest thanks to you, know
! ing that I but faintly state what all my
! people feel in this matter. I am sure that
all worthy colored people have been very
j hopeful that they would be accorded the
j same treatment that people of the white
; race receive, and that where there are
! violations of the laws, as there must be
while poor humanity is groping- Its way
toward the light and a wiser understand
ing of what is their duty toward their fel-
I low man, and best for themselves, the
laws would be permitted to have their
course and the barbarians of mob pro
ceedings would be frowned upon by all
good citizens. It is undeniable that
very many of my people lose calm reason
when they hear of such horrid crimes as
those which lately darkened the' skies in
Georgia, and they feel excused for being
unduly severe upon the crazy men who
I took the lead in that sad transaction; and
it is a fact that nothing so quickly brings
them back to a proper way of reasoning
as reading such noble sentiments as you
have expressed when referring to the
hasty actions of the cowardly mob.
It is not my purpose to keep the angry
| feelings alive, but it seems well that you
i should know how grateful we all feel to
] you for expressing what the best citizens
of the country. North and South, feel in
regard to these unfortunate occurrences.
I am sure that each recurring lynching
has a tendency to weaken the bonds of
law and order In the community where it
takes place, and that these spread to oth
er communities, creating prejudice, if not
hatred. But if all the influential jour
nals speak the sentiments of the better
class of their, readers, as you have, it
cannot be long until exact justice will be
â¢assured to all. Again thanking you, I
am sincerely yours.

USURPATION OF POWER.
The Call: I am glad that some of the
teachers and parents are speaking out
against the folly and in justice of school
examinations. That system never had
the support of good thinkers and is now
entirely behind the times. Scholars should
be promoted whenever their teachers
think them fit, and in many cases
even when they have not done even pass
ably well in a study it is better for them
to "go on to something else. I believe
parents have the authority to order their
children advanced and also to order any
study dropped. But assuredly when par
ents and teacher agree, no Board of Ed
tlon or other power ought to interfere,
and I do not believe have any legal pow
er to do so. I hope to see a fight made
J by parents to curb the selfish pretentiona
â¢ of Boards of Education and others. They
! do it selfishly to increase their power and
! importance, "it is a common practice for
! Boards of Education to spend many days
I (at $5 per day) making lists of questions
! for examination of pupils, and other days
i falFo at %o per day) looking over the pu
i pils' answers. All of which is without
' any authority of law and is a plain swin
i die on the public Treasury, as a reading
of section 1771, School Law, will show.
! That section defines the powers of County
' Boards of Education, but neither ther.^
nor any where is any power given them
to usurp the functions of teachers and
parents in the matter of pupils' examina
tions. Respectfully, W. S. PROSSER,
Civil Engineer.

R r M. M. GWIN, INCUMBENT, A
GOOD GOLD DEMOCRAT.
Senator Perkins Favors the Candi
dacy of Ex-Harbor Commis
sioner Charles F.
Bassett.
â¦ â
The late decision regarding places
' hat are exempt from civil service reg
" jlation opens to the appointive power
the right to fill several good Federal
offices in California.
Before the recent order was promul
gated at Washington many of the pol
iticians entertained the view that the
office of United States Shipping Com
missioner was not embraced in the
civil service list. The late decision
makes it clear that it is not so em
braced, although a formal declaration
to that effect by the Civil Service Com
mission may be required in advance of
changes.
The office of Deputy Naval Officer and
that of chief deputy United States
Marshal are no longer embraced in the
civil service list, but there are no in
dications of immediate change in
either quarter. Mr. Farrish, the chief
deputy under Marshal Shine, served
under Marshals Long and Baldwin. E.
W. Maalln, the chief deputy under
Naval Officer John P. Irish, is capable
and appears to have a firm hold on his
position.
The incumbent of the office of United
States Shipping Commissioner, San
Francisco, is William M. Gwin. He se
cured the place during President
Cleveland's administration through
the friendly influences of Senator Le
land Stanford and Justice Field of the
United States Supreme Court. Mr.
Gwin is known as a gold Democrat,
and his friends and supporters contend
that California was saved to McKinley
by the liberal support which Demo
crats gave to "sound money principles.
They mention further that Mr. Gwin
has ably and honestly administered
the affairs of the office and that his
removal would be contrary to good
politics and fair dealing.
The office formerly paid $5000 or $6000
a year, but a few years ago the com
pensation was reduced. It is now worth
$3600 per annum. The office was at
tractive enough a year ago to- enlist the
aspirations of Paris Kilburn, and he
obtained thÂ« indorsement of many
leading Republicans for the place. In
the ; litical changes, or readjustments,
brought about by the election of Henry
T. Gage as Governor and a Republican
Legislature Mr. Kilburn was slated for
the p.-sition of president of the State
Boarii of Harbor Commissioners. There
is no doubt that the public service was
bettered by Mr. Kilburn's appointment,
.-:nce he succeeded E. S. Colnon of
Stockton. A change from Colnon to
<<ny other person was bound to be a
change for the better.
Mr. Kilburn gracefully switched from
Shipping Commissioner to Harbor Com
missioner, because tidings from Wash
ington did riot give assurance of his
immediate success in obtaining the
Federal position. After the change of
base ex-Harbor Commissioner Charles
F. Bassett, who discovered Markham,
was brought out as a candidate for the
office of Shipping Commissioner to fill
the vacancy caused by the transfer of
Mr. Kilburn's aspirations elsewhere.
The Markham discovered by Bassett
was not the "Man With the Hoe." but
the man with the "magnetic hand."
The magnetic Markham was elected
Governor of California to serve the
people, but preferred to serve instead
Dan Burns and Mose Gunst, and is re
membered now only to be pitied. He is
alone at present in his obscurity, but is
expecting company.
United States Senator Perkins is said
to be in sympathy with the desire of
Mr. Bassett to be appointed Shipping
Commissioner, and in this respect Mr.
KHburn is believed to be heartily in
accord with the Senator. There are
other aspirants to the number of ten
or twelve, and no doubt among them
Congressman Eugene F. Loud has a fa
vorite. The fight for the position bids
fair to become quite interesting. Mr.
Gwin will not relinquish the place with
out a struggle. He Is comfortably en-
Bconced in the chair and is not without
friends in high places who would be
pleased to see his name permanently
inscribed on the Federal pay roll.

LEGALITY OF
THE CHARTER
IS ATTACKED
Action Is Brought by
M. F. Fragley.
VARIOUS DEFENDANTS NAMED
ALLEGATIONS MADE THAT IT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
A. Ruef and T. V. Cater Appear
Attorneys, With John Garber
and E. S. Pillsbury as
Counsel.
Contrary to expectations, the action of
the officials who claim to be not city and
county but county officers against the
charter was not tilled yesterday, but an
other action of greater importance. >ii
rected against the new organic law of the
city and having as its object the Invali
dating of the charter In toto. was made
of record. M. F. Fragley. Superintendent
of Strtets, appears as plaintiff in the ac
tion, although it is understood that <aeh
official now holding office within
the municipality or under the consoli
dation act is lending his support. It is
directed against the Board of Election
Commissioners, James D. Phelan, Frank
lin K. Lane, Asa K. Wells, Edward I.
Sheehan and Charles S. Tilton; Janus D.
Phelan as Mayor, Jacob Bteppacher as
Registrar, Asa R. Wells as Auditor and
1. J. Truman as Treasurer, for the pur
pose of enjoining them from holding or
conducting a primary election on Auga^t
8 or at all, or a municipal flection on No
vember 7 under the provisions of or as
provided by the charter. Without an
election it is obvious that all officials no.v
in office will hold over for their full terms
as provided in the present law. If it is
held that they rutty nold the charter will
iau. and this Is the object of tue present
battle of its enemies.
In fact the battle to invalidate the
charter is on in earnest, and every tech
nicality known to the law will be used by
the strategists of the local bar. In intro
duction or the complaint the plaintiff
makes known the status of himself and
the various defendants in the community.
Then he enters into the law upon which
the right on the present suit will be prose
cuted. A synopsis of these points, which
cu\er several pages, brings the points up
and centers them on the validity and con
stitutionality of the special election by
virtue of which the Board of Freeholders,
which framed the charter, were chosen,
.-.'.ir. also the election at which the people
voted for and accepted the same. On this
point the complaint reads: "Plaintiff is
informed and believes and alleges that
the act of March 31, 1897, under which
f the special elections of December
27, 1597, and of May 26, 1898, were so as
aforesaid held, is unconstitutional and
void by reason that it is contrary to the.
provisions of section 6 of article 11
of the constitution of California, and is
also lor other reasons unconstitutional
and void." For these reasons it Is al
leged in tiie complaint that the approval
of the charter by the Legislature was il
legal, null and void and In consequence
the instrument Is not a charter of the
city and county, but in an Invalid Instru
ment, wholly illegal, null and void, and
of no force, or effect.
Notwithstanding the fact that the char
ter is void, the complaint continues. Ihe
defendants will proceed "> hold and con
duct the elections stated and will incur
expenses therefor exceeding the sum of
$35,000. which will he- allowed by the Au
ditor and paid by the Treasurer. Where
fore the plaintiff prays that the Mayor be
enjoined from issuing an election
proclamation as provided by the charter,
that the Election Commissioners he re-
Btralned from holding such elections and
that the Auditor and Treasurer be aIBO
Included in thp Hidgment of the court.
A. Ruef and Thnma? V. f'ator appear ;â . s
attorneys for Superintendent of Streets
Fragley. and John earner and E. S. Pllls-
Imry are associated as counsel. These
men are confident that under the points
named a successful fight against the
charter will be waged, notwithstanding
tho opinion of City and County Attorney
Lane, who Is a member of the Election
Commission, that the points are far
fetched and that the charter will stand
all assaults that may be made upon its
validity.

CHOPS HER HUSBAND'S
HEAD WITH A HATCHET
MRS. ROSINA DE CICO'S Frantic De
fense of Her Children.
IN a moment of frenzy due to the belief that she was about to be deprived
of her three children. Mrs. Bosinade Cico yesterday afternoon attacked her
husband with an hatchet, inflicting two ugly scalp wounds. The assault
occurred in a house at 10 Hinekley alley and was witnessed by Police Offi
cer McMUrray and Victor Demartini. the official Italian interpreter.
After a short struggle the infuriated woman was disarmed and re
moved to the City Prison, where she was charged with an assault to commit
murder. Hor husband, who was rendered unconscious by the blows, was at
once taken to the Receiving Hospital. He was bleeding profusely froni the
wounds on his head and seemed to be fatally injured. Police Surgeon Weil
soon restored him to consciousness and after stitching the wounds allowed
him to leave the hospitnl.
Do Cico in broken English informed the Police Surgeon that his wife, evi
dently thinking that he wns about to take possession of their children, at
tacked him with the hatchet. "Several weeks ago," he explained, "my wife
and 1 had a row and she announced that she intended to leave me and take
the children with her. Wo were then living in Portland, and as I did not think
she meant what she said I paid no attention to hor threat. I went to my
work and on my return in the evening I was astounded to find that she was
fOOi BUS well as our children.
"I immediately started an investigation, with the result that I learned
that my wife had flown with Pasquel Fuego. who was a frequent visitor 10
my house. Anxious to regain possession of my children T consulted with the
Chief of Police- of Portland and he advised me to visit San Francisco, as I was
satisfied that my wife -and children had reached this city. I lost no time in
packing my grip and coming here, as I was determined to see my children,
even at the risk of my life. 1 reached the city Sunday evening and at once
communicated . with Chief Lees. After hearing my story he detailed Police
Officer Mr-Murray to assist mf. We had little difficulty in locating my wife
and children in a house on Hinckley alley. As we entered she seemed pleas
ant enough, and as I informed her that I intended to take the children away
she excused herself on the pea that she wanted to s^e a friend who lived In
the house, but promised to return in a few minutes. Shortly afterward the re
appeared armed with a hatchet. I was conversing with the police officer
when she sneaked up behind me and dealt me a blow on the head. As I stag
gered up against the wall she again struck me with the hatciiet. Evidently
realizing that she intended to kill me, Mr. Demartini seized her and after a
sharp struggle succeeded in disarming her. Fuego was in the rouse at the
time, but scenting trouble, coward that he is, he made his escape."
After locking the woman up, McMurray took the children to the City Pris
on, where they were placed in chirge> of the matron. To-day they will be pent
to some public lnstitutiem. The woman denies that she eloped with Fuego and
claims that she was drfven to leave her husband on account of his brutal treat
ment.

SAFE AND LOCK
MAKERS FORM
ANOTHER TRUST
One More Monopoly
in Staples Created.
PRICES WILL NOT BE RAISED
THE HALL COMPANY IS THE
FATHER OF THE SCHEME.
Western Agents of the Eastern Man
ufacturers Get the News and
Immediately Combine Along
the Lines of Agreement.
And now the makers of safes and locks
have formed a trust. Its first Influence
was felt in San Francisco yesterday when
the Western agent? of the big vault and
lock making concerns of the East got the
word that war was over among them and
was to be thereafter waged solely against
their patrons.
Outside the insurance business there has
been no line of trade in which competi
tion was more bitter and more strongly
waged than in the selling of safes. The
Western agents of the different manufac
turers have had their agents and drum
mers in every town in the State. There
has been a cutting and a slashing of rates
that has made a safe as easy a thing to
buy as a sewing machine or piano at $10
down and $3 a week. Profits have got to
be a matter of unusual luck rather than
a legitimate result of fair trade, and up
to yesterday the safe and lock business
did not hold out as promising a future
as it once did.
For two weeks the formation of this
latest trust has been ifnmhient. Negotia
tions looking to it began in the East as
much as three months ago, but there were
two firms that held out against it.
Which ones they were the Western
agents decline to say, and, in fact, deny
that there has been any combination
at all.
On Saturday the stubborn members of
the combination came over and yesterday
the news was wired to this city. It
brought Immeasurable relief. Ever since
the deal was first announced the local
agents have been calling in their drum
mer and holding them at home at consid
erable expense. Business has been at a
standstill and there has been nothing save
expense and anxiety as to the probable
outcome.
The local agents decline to be inter
viewed on the proposition. Colonel Giest
ing, manager of the Hall Safe and Lock
Company, which made the rirst proposal
for the formation of the trust, denies hav
ing heard anything of it. His junior part
ner, however, is not so cautious in his
statements and admitted yesterday that
the projected trust was an accomplished
fact. He said, however, that the combina
tion would result in no Increase in prices,
but solely In an economy in working and
selling expenses.
Sent Up for Six Months.
Louis L. Starr, Â«. young man who made
It a practice to order a sewing machine
and sell it without paying for it. pleaded
guijty to petty larceny in Judge Graham's
court yesterday, and the Judge sent him
to the County Jail for six months. A

against him to the pulice.

"SIGN" FOR LIFE
Will Wed Miss Elizabeth
Mahoney To-Morrow
Evening.
Joseph A. Corhett has announced to his
friends that to-morrow evening he will
renounce the shallow joys of bachelordom
and let Miss Elizabeth Mahoney make '
him the happiest of men.
That Corbett was affianced to Miss
Mahoney has been known for some time
to the intimate friends of the young
couple, but the existence of the engage
ment was formally announced only yes
terday. Miss Mahoney, the fair bride to
be, is a popular and charming young lady,
the daughter of Jeremiah Mahoney. the
contractor and builder and member of the
firm Mahoney Bros.
Mr. Corbett is well and favorably known
here, and enjoys a national reputation as
an erstwhile pitcher of the National
Baseball League. Of late, however, the
prospective groom has not given any at
tention to the national game, but has
devoted himself entirely to the continu
ance of the business established by his
father.
The wedding, which has been set for to
morrow evening at the residence of the
bride's parents, 540 Page street, will be,
owing to the recent death of Mr. Corbett's
parents, a very quiet affair, and only the
relatives and intimate friends of the
young couple have been invited.

BIGAMIST GRIGSBY CAPTURED.
Clever Bit of Detective Work by Post
office Inspector Erwin in Tracing
the Much-Married Man.
Willis O. Grigsby, bigamist, has been
lecated^and arrested through the clever
detective work of Postoffice Inspector
Erwin of this citj. Grigsby, while a gay
soldier boy, married three consecutive
â wives without going through the formali
ty of potting a divort-e from the old be
fore taking on the new, andÂ«he State
courts are waiting for him. Then wife
No. 3. chagrined on finding that she was.
only third choice and in the list of those
who "also ran," went before the Federal
Grand Jury and procured the indictment
of the military Don Juan for using official
envelopes without a postage stamp, the
offense being a misdemeamor.
A day or two ago Mrs. Grigsby the third
received a letter from the man who won
her heart. The letter she took to In
spector Erwin arid told the inspector that
she had promised to give the story to the
papers it the inspector would kindly de
cipher the blurred postmark and inform
her of the place from which the letter had
come. The inspector was wroth that Mrs.
Grigsby should have given the tip to the j
papers* and thus set Grigsby on His guard.
But he took the letter and was able to
decipher "gan" and "Col." He searched
through the records of postoffices in
Colorado and found that there was one
at the military post of Fort Logan, and he
telegraphed to the commander of the
post a full description of the missing
man. Mr. Erwin received a telegram in
reply late yesterday afternoon to the
effect that Grigsby had enlisted under
the name of "York," and that he had
been turned over to the custody of the
United States Marshal.
Grigsby will be brought here to stand
trial before the State court for bigamy,
and the United States court for using an
official envelope for private business.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June s.â The professional trad
ers on the Stock Exchange made industrious
attempts all day to get into the current of
speculation. But as a matter of fact there
was almost no current to sneak of. so that the
hoard room traders found themselves drifting
and floundering in stagnant waters. They
changed Bides several times in the dull mar
ket, and the net changes on the day are con
sequently unimportant outside a few of the
specialties, though the general average of prices
tis notably lower The opening showed declines
under the influence of the heaviness in the for
eign markets, on account of the disturbed state
of affairs in France. Sugar and a nurnwr <n
other specialties were attacked and the bears
also had their side a falling off in the east
bound tonnage from Chicago, a decrease in
Rock Island's net earnings for April and re
newed strength in the wheat market. The mani
fest distiosition of a bull party to take up a
group of iron and steel stocks on account of the
extraordinary prosperity in that trade served
to check the decline. The Urge receipts of
wheat at interior points offset the fears of
1 Top damage and a .-â¢Tie? of good returns on
current traffic of various railroads also helped
to strengthen the stocks of those properties
The local stocks showed a disposition to ad
vance and it looked like the Inauguration of a
hull movement, when the break in Sugar awak
ened uneasiness and the making of commit
ments on the lons Bide WHS put a stop to.
There was .thine notable in the trading there
after. The extreme break In Sugar was 7 points
and the rally on covering caused some harden
ing in â¢'â¢!- genera] list. The recovery In Sugar
amounted to 2\, the net loss being 2\. Na
tional Steel. Pressed Steel Car and Tennessee
Coal and Iron held their advance rather better
than the other steel stocks. There was a
spresd in the American Smelting stocks, the
common weakening sharply, while the pre
ferred advanced over a point The plethoric
condition of the money market, the good rail
way earnings reported and the general activity
and prosperous conditions In all general chan
nels of trade are accepted as causing increased
vnlues to securities. But the sugar trade war
and other possibilities fa setback to the
highly speculative stocks as well as the mani
fest disposition to renew an unbridled specula
tion in thÂ» securities if the new and untried in
dustrials combinations begets distrust and hesi
tation on the part of the capitalists. i
Prices were much metter maintained In the
bond market than in the stock market, but
business in that department was also small. \
Total sales, par value, J1, 990,000. United States
old fours coupon advanced i. and the threes
and the new fours \* in the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June '..âThe start In wheat rather
favored the bulls Foreign markets showed
good advances. There was the usual selling
by tongs satisfied with their profits, but the
strength of the foreign markets was influential
enough to create a Â»-"â¢ â â ! buying demand and
for th*> first half hour trading Â»i< quite active.
After that, however, new fad cam- into
the market of a distinctly bearish color and
prlce6 suffered In consequence^ Crop reports
throughout 'the West and Northwest were In
the main decidedly favorable, those from the
Northwest 'predicting the largest crop in ye.-irs.
Weather conditions were also more favorable.
ITie severest blows have come from the visible
supply figures. These showed an increase of
1.803,000 bushels. .As a substantial decrease
had been looked for the announcement brought
large quantities .of long wheat Into the mar
ket. Final {trices were hut a sh;ide above th"
lowest of the dny. July opened at 78>4c, com
pared with ll\<(!~Zii , the closing pi ii Satur
day. It sold Immediately at TR'v, then gradu
ally declined to 7* : 'Â»'\ closing at 7l>iÂ«c.
Corn wan moderately active. The market
was affected by the exceptionally favorable
crop* reports and ruled weak almost from the
start, closing at ! Â«<" decline.
.Oats were fairly active- and weak. The mar
ket, like corn, was Influenced by the favorable
crop conditions and the wheat weakness, the
good cash demand not having enough influence
to sustain prices. July lost Vie.
Provisions were dull and steady. There was
pome selling influenced by the grain weakness.
Shorts absorbed all offerings and prices fluctu
ated hut little. Hog prices were fairly steady.
July pork closed a shade higher, July lard 2V4c
higher and July ribs .i shade higher.

DRIED FRUITS. NUTS AND RAISINS.
Mail advices from New York say: Jr
"Raisins are quiet. The only feature of in
terest is the discussion of the new crop pros
pects, which appear to be quite satisfactory.
The outlook Is for an average yield, though the
tendency is toward a reduction, as compared
with last year. Sales of California Sultanas
made recently arc said to have cleaned ' the
market up, but no particulars are given, it
is understood, however, that close to market
prices were obtained. Other grades show no
change In price, and are very Inactive. No
important change In price is expected at pres
ent. General conditions Indicate a probably
dull market indefinitely.
"Prunes are steady. There -were rumors Sat
urday, however, that outside interests were
trying to secure control of the market, but
what they offered or what they proposed doing
did not appear Under present conditions any
important purchase would have a strong In
fluence on the market. Crop reports from Ore
gon are to the effect that the yield there is- un
likely to be as large as was anticipated, though
a fair crop Is probable." ,

War Over Freight Rates Between Two
Cities Produces Some Telegrams
and Lively Corre
spondence.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, June 5.
The severe criticism of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association of San
Francisco of the Oakland Board of
Trade, published in the Call of last Satur
day, has brought out the following state
ment from the executive committee of the
latter body:
The information contained in this article
was evidently furnished by some biased
party. An.i the writer must have thrown
his heart into tha matter, judging from the
headlines ami the conclusions drawn.
Still, an interested party, one whose
freight rates have bd>n mcrea.-ed anywhere
from $10i -0 to S^O.OtX) a year by reason of the
manipulation* of last year, can fret a great
dial of meaning Iro'.n the article.
This is a case where organized bodies
representing: a minority of the shippers of
California managed last â .â¢â â -â  an
advantage by having rates put uj) on the
mixed carload shippers. The ostensible
object was to enable the lame San Fran
cisco jobbers to sell In petitl in with
Kastorn houses and to stop the present drift
of . the retailer and consumer to reach the
producer direct, even if the small jobbers,
. the retailers ai;d consumers have to be taxed
millions of dollars a year in order to ac
coir.pl fc-h It.
Perhaps a l>iiof history of the proceedlrijrs
w.l! I)* the best way to put the matter be
fore the public, so that they may draw
â¢ their own conclusions:
The fir*t â â¢â¢â .â¢ attracted the atten
tion of the Oakland Board of Trade was
the ousting of one of its members, without
any rpuse or resignation, from the directory
of. the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation of California and at the name meet
i:p electing- Mr. Everett to fill the vacancy.
This Mr. Everett waa made chairman of
the traffic ..-ornrr.ittee of that body. Soon
Mr. Everett developed as the champion
â¢><jualiz<Â»r" ft freight tea before the
"Western Tragic Association, which met at
Monterey and adjourned to Milwaukee So
ruccer-sful was the San Francisco delega
tion, under the evident leadership of Mr.
Kverett. that this pentleman telegraphed
back.. "California is saved." Soon the new
freipht schedules mado their appearance,
and lo! there was an advanco of 10 to K>o per
cent on less than carload shipments west
bound. The Oakland Board of Trade about
this time received a communication from
. the Los Angeles Merchants' an.] Manufue
. turei Association complaining of the dis
crimination and askin< for support toward
pecurin^ redress by organization or other
wise. The matter was referred to a com
mittee in conjunction with the principal
shippers of this city. This, committee Bleed
for a conference v!th Chairman Kverett.
In his r.lace came Mr. AllÂ«>n. who met the
Oakland shipper*. Mr. Allen pave a history
of the overtures and negotiations of the
traffic coinmJtirt* of th*Â» AlHnufitrturarfl' an.! I
Producers' Association of California, of '
which he was a member. He claimed that
It ma,i*> ni difference what the freleht rate '
was provided it was the same for all ship
pers of the samo class. We explained that
such was not the case. He admitted finally
that we had a irrievance. that it was not
fair to tax the majority of shippers so
heavily for the benefit of the few and the
transportation companies, lit that the lat
ter; took matters In their own hands after
r.'-erotiatiens were once started.
The Hoard of Trade committee answered
the Los Angles association that we would
join in any effort to remedy matters. We t
rover heard frcm them afterward, nor did I
w*> learn why. There was a great dÂ»al of
mnrmurins all over the State on account
of the mw rates, but for lack of organiza
tion nothing could be done.
When the newspapers mentioned some two
weeks since that a committee was on its
â¢way to St. Paul to induce the Great North
ern ar.rt Northern Pacific to restore, the dis
criminating rat<-s fixed last year at Mil
vaukw,.Bome of our members saw an op
portunity to in some degree ventilate the
grievances of the mixed carload shippers.
The matter was referred to our executive
committee with power to act. A brief state
ment was F<-nt to three or four â â â h-T organ
izations. Our committee telegraphed to thi
representatives of the two northern roads
at St. Paul, statin? ;hat we hoped the dis
criminating rales of last year would be dis
continued.
Next day n committee from the Whole
pale .Hardware Association of San Fran
cisco called to demand that the Hoard of
Trade rescind its action. They argued that
because the conference at St. Paul was not
diecusPirp ratfs generally we should with
draw our attitude in the interest of the suc
cess of the'ffan Francisco jobbers. We were
anxious to see our neighbors prosper, but we
felt that in view of the wrong done lfist
vtar tn (he mixed carload shippers we could
not withdraw the telegram.
A ffcw days ago the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association of California pent
out a circular explaining their part in fram
ing; lnst year's freight rates. They nd
mitted having petitioned for an equalization
of rates, but disclaimed any Intention to
discriminate. They secured an advance of
CO to 100 per cent on westbound mixed car
loads, while the advance on carloads was
practically nothing except a small Increase
in a few instances, on the whole securing
for the transportation companies millions
more revenue, which will come from the
California merchants and consumers It
Is possible that the Oakland Hoard of Trade
cannot do anything to rectify matters, only
to protest. Even that privilege is nom* satis
faction under the circumstances.
As for the boast of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association .it California,

Â«Â£ THE NAME Â£.

Jfe See Below Sop Â£L,
jh. Explanation.
DERIVATION OF CRAPE-
NUTS.
Thought was applied and experi-
ments conducted for about two years
seeking to perfect a food easy for the
Intestinal digestion and yet make use
of the carbo-hydrates, albumen and
phosphate of potash obtained from the
grains.
Success came, and luckily the scien-
tific food was found to have a most
delicious and delicate sweet, that of
the grape-sugar to be seen glistening
on the granules. That suggested the
llrst part of the now famous name.
The last part, "Nuts," is purely fanci-
ful, the compound word Grape-Nuts
being a coined word, having no actual
meaning, a necessary feature to con-
form to the rules of the United States
Patent Office on the registration of
trade marks.
"Grape-Nuts" is a duly registered
trade mark protecting the most famous
food of the day from counterfeiters.

NEAR A DEFICIT
Native Sons Expected
Too Much.
Oakland Office Ban Vr.,-
Broadwa . , June 5.
Th r -f are a few very II d Na
tive B IÂ» ; i ' ; tr ht â¢ ra In City, a lid
there are othen who are not at ail sor
rowful that tin- recent much-heralded
n Carnival was ;t huge failure so far
â¢ . purpos< lor which it was organized
â  â â <].
Chairman Cushing of the executive com
; mittee gave away the whole secret this
afternoon. "Tin- boys have themselves to
blame for not making a pile of money at
the carnival," said Mr. Cushing. "1
j first place we w< irmonious. There
are four parlors of Native Suns ami one
of Daughters In this city, yet only two of
. them were taken into the proposition. I
j was in favor after the affair was started
| of combining our parlor, Oakland, with
(Brooklyn. Athens am) Aloha parlors, but
' there was i in the commits c on
the ground that ir we made a thousand
dollars we should have t" divide 11
tween half a dozen parlors, and i-^me of
the Oakland boys wanted it all them
selves.
"Then it was reasonably supposed th.-it
we should sell many more season tickets.
There were 2Z> members of Oakland i'.ir
jor and Piedmont Parlor of Nativi Daugh
ters, and we thought each one would â I]
at least five season tickets. As a roatti t
of fact there were Just 371 season t!<
Bold. Then the boys did not patronise it
themselves. They did not take any inter
est in it. and us a result we may have $40
over or we may come out just even. We
cannot blame the manager, lor he kept
his part faithfully. Hut some of thÂ° bo- th
committees dirt not show Rood buÃl
judgment. Instead of going B round rind
getting presents of tiling t i be i
for and to sell in the booths, me. young
ladles went out and purchased them ana
the billy flocked in faster fhaa we could
file them. That is not the way to make
money out of a benefit fete. However, the
hoys of Oakland Parlor an- not sore about
it f. >r they will nil put their hands in their
pockets and dig up Jlu or $20 apiece to
make a Showing In the Jubilee Carnival,
for our parlor always takes the lead on
such occasions. All the committees
worked hard, but they were not support
ed."
The purpose of the carnival was to raise
money so that Oakland Parlor could make
an extraordinary showing in the festivities
of the Btati carnival, when the Goldrn
Carnival closed it was reported that $3000
had been cleared. Later the amount was
out down to MOO. Still later to IKM. The
executive committee will meet to wind up
it? affairs on Wednesday evening and it is
hopÂ»d that they will not have to report a
deficit.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1899.
IT WILL SOLICIT
MANY SUBSCRIPTIONS
FOURTH OF JULY COMMITTEE
HAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY.
: The Executive Committee of the Fourth
|of July Committee having in charge
the arrangements for the celebration of
that day, met In their headquarters in
the Grand Hotel last night, with Chair
! man George R. Fletcher presiding. The
fl Howing resolution was unanimously
adopted by the committee:
Resolved. That the thanks of the Fourth of
: July Committee be and the same are hereby
tendered to General R. IT. Warfleld for his
jrenrrous offer of rooms at the California Hotel
for headquarters; also to
The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
-1 â <â â â -â  for placing telephones in the committee
rooms and use of same free of charge; and to
The Indlanapolli Furniture Company, for fur
nishing necessary desks; and be it further '
Resolved, That the secretary of this com
mittee-be ami is hereby instructed to forward
f o the respective parties named herein a copy
of these resolutions.
The Finance Committee reported that it
had decided to solicit subscriptions among
the merchants, as the appropriation of
$..000 Is not sufficient for a proper celebra
! tion. The committee arrived at this con
clusion in view of the fact that the First
California Regiment will be home by the
Frurth. and the occasion will be one upon
which too much honor can not be done
the brave boys. They propose in conse
quence of this fact to make the celebra
tion this year one that will be remember)
for all time. No one but the members
, of the Finance Committee will be allowed
to solicit subscriptions.
I A i gram will be sent to General
Smith requesting him, it" possible to be
hero by the Fourth of July. The Naval
Ccmmittee, consisting of XV. J. Herrin. Z.
U. Dodge and John M. Chretien, reported
that it had had an authoritative assurance '
I from General Shafter that the First Call
| fornla Regiment will be here in time to !
join in the celebration of the Fourth.
James li. O'Brien nominated John M
Chretien for the position of vice chairman
Di the Executive Committee, and he was
unanimously elected.
ALLEGED WIDOW JAMES.
â
The case of the estate of tho late Dr.
<"haiies A. James has been sent back to
the Superior Court for a retrial by the
Supreme Court This litigation has at
tracted some little attention in this city.
I>r. James owned valuabh property on
Howard street, and BOOn after his death a
1 young woman claiming to be his widow
and giving the name of Mrs. Laura Milen
, James made, on behalf of herself and In
fant son, a claim to a share of the prop
erty. In this she was contested by an
other woman, also declaring herself to be
widow of the deceased.
In the lower court l^aura based her
claim to relationship on a marriage con
tract dated January, 1896. The .Ju<![:" of
the lower court did not place much con
fidence in the contract or the relatlon
i ship, and decided that she was not the
widow of the deceased James and that
the infant child was not his. The court
made a decree for the distribution of the
i state to those believed to be entitled
thereto. At the same time the court de
ni< d a motion for a new trial of the case.
It was from this that the appeal was
taken.
The higher court in reviewing the evl
and ruling's of the lower court con
-1 that gross errors had been made in
the admission of certain testimony and )
the rejecting of other testimony. Upon
the grounds Of error the judgment and
order were reversed and the case sent
back for a new t ri;il.
Collection Agents at Outs.
Ji:le- c. Qamage, manager of the Hard-
Ing Collection Agency, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Treadwell'a court yester
day for the arrest of M. H. Harding on
(he charge Of disturbing the peace. There
has been trouble between the two as to
the management of the agency, and June
1 Harding met Oamage on Jackson and
Taylor streets and a row followed.
DR. C, R, BROWN
WAS "SURPRISED"
BY HIS FRIENDS
Six Hundred of Them
Storm His House.
THEY WANT HIM IN QAKLAND
A UNIQUE DEMONSTRATION LED
BY MAYOR SNOW.
Effort to Keep the Pronounced Ant.
Expansionist From Accept
*^g the Stanford
Chaplaincy.
I One of the most remarkaVie demonstra
â  tions ever held in Oakland was made lost
i night when a crowd of Gf'O people, led by
Mayor Snow and Rev. J. K. McLean,
went from the church to the home of Rev.
C. R. Brown, pastor of the First Con
| gregational Church, to testify to their de
cision that they did not want Dr. Brown
i to accept the offered chaplaincy at Btan
for University.
This demonstration is all the more re
markable because Rev. C. R. Brown is a
very pronounced anti-expansionist, and
his recent lecture before the Sons of the
American Revolution caused a heated de
bate and it was desired to expurgate his
speech before publishing It in pamphlet
form.
The meeting called last night was for
the purpose of having the congregation
: express its views In the matter of the pas
; tor accepting the call from Stanford.
Mayor Snow presided, and after speeches
by Judge Hall, Senator Earl, C. W. Kel
i logg, R. H. Chamberlain and Judge J. M.
Havens, a letter was prepared by a com
; mittee consisting of Judge Havens, R. H.
Chamberlain and Cary Howard. The
salient features of the letter are as fol
lows:
The members of your church and con
nregatlon have read disquieting statements
In the dally papers to the effect that you
have hail under careful consideration on
Invitation from Stanford University to ac
cept a position In that institution. These
statements have caused serious alarm not
i only to your own church and congregation,
but to the wider public throughout the Pa
cific Coast, who have come to recognize your
power for good as a Christian minister in
j Firstâ It Is respectfully submitted that It
you now resicn your pastorate your work
in Oakland for nearly three years will be
largely lost. Your pulpit at this time would
i leave the congregation in danger of dis
ruption, with no adequate force of cohesion.
The continuously large accessions to the
church anil Increase of attendance on its
vices during your ministry here are evi
dently tra. cable to your personal Influence.
; ' Secondâ lt Is further respectfully sub
' mitted that there cannot be any other field
of labor where the opportunities for abund
ant harvests In the vineyard of your Master
I will be as certain as are offered in your
i present pastorate. Your congregations are
: not changed each year. Very few pastors
are loved as you are loved by your people.
Your Virile thoughts are scattered far and
wide In the columns of the Pacific. Your
! Sabbath evening services are eagerly at
! tended by a non-churchgoing and largely
| float in: population.
i Thirdâ Not a communion has passed since
you came to this peopS* without accessions
to this church. At the price of much sacri
fice the heavy indebtedness of the church
i has been liquidated. Clear of debt, and with
united, sentiment of devotion to duty, the
church is about to enter upon the fourth
year of its history under your pastorate
with clearer manifestation of God's ap
proval and lance than ever before,
i Fourthâ Your people are not unmindful of
the attractions offered you. Hut has it not
been the long pastoratesâ those o(
i Ptorrs and Beecher and Brooks and some
of the Pacific Slopeâ which have been the
richest in blessing to pastor and people
alike? Can you expect to permanently In
â  fluence a large community of young people
who have no homes, and who are only tem
porarily residents at the university? There
Is doubtless force In the suggestion that the
: presence of Fueh a man as the pastor of
thin church is a need felt at Stanford Uni
versity: but will it not be easier for Stan
ford University to secure the services of the
! needed man than for this church and con
gregation to find another Charles H. Brown,
who as pastor and preacher, Is trusted ana
loved by every one? It may be a disappoint
ment to the president and faculty cÂ£ Stan
ford University If the pastor of this church
declines their invitation, but there will not
be 1200 or more broken-hearted and discour
aged parishioners refusing to be comforted.
â¢ There will be no disrupted congregation. Its
scattered members asking "Where now Is
our teacher?" The united and tearful ex
! clamation of every man, woman and child
of your congregation la "We cannot let
him BO." ...v-:.-
No sooner had the committee been in
structed to bear the' letter to Rev. Mr.
Brown than a suggestion from Dr. J. K.
McLean was unanimously adopted that
all those who were able march to the
pastor's home at 322 Twenty-second
street. Rev. Dr. McLean and Mayor
Snow were chosen as leaders, an adjourn
ment was taken and the entire assem
blage marched out and practically
stormed their pastor's home.
As Rev. Mr. Brown stepped to the door
to answer the bell and receive the com
mittee, the pastor's favorite hymn,
"Blessed Be the Tie That Binds Our
Hearts in Christian Love," was sung.
That the pastor was completely overcome
with surprise was plainly visible in his
features, the tears in his kindly eyes and
the tone of his voice as he responded to
the reading of the letter.
"I cannot trust myself to speak to you
to-night," said Rev. Mr. Brown, pdrtly
regaining his composure. "1 cannot at
this time express my heartfelt apprecia
tion over this demonstration. 1 thought I
knew how much 1 loved our church, but
1 never knew how much you all loved
me. It Is not a matter of choice in at
tractions, and 1 know that you have all
prayed that God might givo me strength
and direct me in this matter: he gather
ing under this roof to-night indicates your
Bincere sentiment. I can only say that I
thank you and ask you for your constant
prayers that an All-Wise Being may
guide me. 1 cannot trust myself to speak
further to you to-night."
While in his words the layman might
llnd couched some doubt as to Rev. Mr.
Brown's final and definite answer, most
of those who called on him to night ex
press little doubt as to their victory. Rev.
Mr. Brown is not a man to be swept
away with the tide of any demonstration
or Impulses. His decision therefore would
follow only a calm and earnest delibera
tion on his part.
Rev. Mr. Brown has now had the propo
sition from Stanford under consideration
for the past seven weeks, though in the
event of an acceptance his charge would
not take effect until September, 1900.
Stanford expects his answer this week.
NO EXPURGATION.
Warren Olney Publishes Rev.
C. H. Brown's Sentimen's
Against Imperialism.
The Rev. C. R. Brown of Oakland in de
livering an address before the Sons of
the American Revolution upon "The Ride
of Paul Revere" stirred up his audience
by an eloquent excoriation on imperial
ism and expansion. His listeners were
divided in their convictions and latterly,
when Warren Olney published the ora
tion, the expansionists exerted every
means to have that portion of the speech
which referred to imperialism stricken
from the pamphlet. Warren Olney would
not permit a line, to be eliminated. That
part of the speech to which the opposi
tion took umbrage is as follows:
1 wonder how many of our soldiers yonder
around Manila to-night know why they, are
there shooting naked savages! What deep un
derlying principle of political Justice makes It
necessary for them to be there at all? I listen
soberly while ministers of the KOSDeI tell us
that we are doing It In the interests of {'Chris
tian civilization." I read slowly when ' Jubi
lant newspapers speak In glowing terms about
the soread of a "beneficent Anglo-Saxon Im
perialism." Perhaps I am - old-fashioned, but
1 cannot make It seem right. In the glorious
days of which wo have been talking to-night
we founded a greater and a stronger nation, be
cause we claimed the right to govern the sml
i>n which we lived And now by a strange in
version of our ideas we are fighting the help
less niir.inos because, forsooth, the- claim the
same rieht'. Taxation without representation
*aa tyranny when applied to us. Now, by BOrne
fhuflling of terms it is to be called "philan
thrnphy" arid "benevolent assimilation" when
applied to a rnce weaker than ourselves. I am
forced to believe that some of the propositions
put forward in these days as "up-to-date
American doctrine" would be sadly confusing
to such slmnle and Orthodox old patriots as
Sam Adams and George Washington.
I cannot understand those men who see some
thing grand In transforming our rrestdent.
hitherto a plain democratic official. Into a
quasi king, wearing for the Inferior races
which we shall have conquered a crown of
"beneflce t nt imperialism." I cannot understand
the desires of those who would turn away from
the noble history of a people, homogeneous In
home. In language, in allegiance to on? rÂ°liKi'->n
and in loyalty to one body of democratic prin
ciples, governing themselves nnd offering a
pine,, of refuge for the burdened of every land,
in order to enter upon the uncertain pathway
of expansion into strange and threatening
difficulties. They tell us that these old-fash
ioned American methods have mmle a certain
"Kittle America." and that r."W these Import !
Kuropean methods will transform us into a
"Greater ".nierica." Mr. Chairman. I cannot
believe it. The America frr which I hope and
pray Is an America larger in size, richer in
resource, more fertile In opportunity, more
powerful as an intellectual and moral force in
the world that was the America of a hundred
years ago, hut at its heart eternally true to
the principles of Paul Revere, of Sam Adams
and of John Hancock, of Thomas Jefferson and
of the Immortal Washington.
SONS OF VETERANS
OF CALIFORNIA
OFFICERS ELECTED AT THIR
TEENTH ENCAMPMENT.
The annual encampment of the Sons of
Veterans, Division of California and Ha
waii, was held yesterday in Ruby Hall,
Red Men's building. The several camps
lit" the State were represented by forty
five delegates who, with the division offi
cers, were present and were presided over
by Commander Charles L. Pierce.
The reports of the various officers thai
| were presented showed that the order in
â  this iStat*> is in ;i flourishing condition
and that numerically and financially it
stands better now than it ever did before.
The previous encampment, it appeared
from the report of Commander Pierce,
was held cm the 21st day of April, 1898, the
| day that war was declared as existing
j with Spain, and that day the division,
; whose members are all Instructed in the j
art of war. tendered its services to Presl
<!i til Me Kin ley and in a short time nine I
! companies were ready to be muster* .1 in.
but as an organization no call was made
for it by the President. On the 2lst of
j June the organization was granted per
mission by the Governor of California to
' bear arms.
On the Sth of June Commander Pierce

Mission Business Men Sanguine.
The Mission Business Men's Association
ai its meeting last night expressed It
self as being well satisfied with the pros
pects of having Valencia Btreet repaved
from its Intersection with Twenty-sixth
tn Market and Van ..ess avenue.
Secretary K. S. Harrison reported an es
timate which had been made by an ex
pert of th>' possible expense of the entire
.â¢ something like $60,000. Deducting
from this amount the probable value of
the basalt blocks now on the street at
$7uÂ»iO, WOUld leave the Ilerures this much
less.
Those were the figures laid before tho
executive' rommitteo of t h<- Merchants'
Association at the meeting held by that
body with the directors of the Buslxiees
Men's Association at a recent meeting.
Encouraging words were spoken of tn-;
kind manner In which the proposition was
received by the greater association from
the lesser representing the Mission peo
pit .
Acting in harmony with other improvo
ment associations and clubs, the Valen
cia street merchants unanimously passed
the following r> solution:
"Hr it resolved. That it is the sense of
the Mission Business Men's Association
to oppose the granting of any and all
street railroad franchises I>< fore the op
eration of the new charter."
Director Flageollet spoke with consid
erable feelinp on the manner in which the
school teachers had been treated by being
deprived of their junt and honestly
earned salaries. He said: "Out of all the
city employes there were none who more
honestly performed their duties to the
public, and to deprive them of the wages
w;<s an outrage and an injustice."
A similar plefl was made for the mer
chants who had supplied the city with
goods in Rood faith. They. too. should be.
paid their claims.
These remarks met with tho indorse
ment of the other merchants of the as
sociation. __________________

This morning he entered her room

When she came into the room she smelled

When they entered the room Jarett lired

Ruth Mascott testified at the Coroner's

Retired Merchant Dies.
SAN JOSE. June s.â Seligman Weil
hoimer. a pioneer of Mountain View, died
yesterday after a comparatively short ill
ness. He was a native of Germany, aged
73 years. He settled in Mountain View
in 1859 and engaged in a general merchan
dise business. This he conducted till a
few years ago, when he turned it over to
his sons. A widow and five grown chil
dren survive him.
Identity of a Dead Man.
MARYSVILL.E, June s.â lt is thought
the name of the man who was killed by
the Knights Landing train in Slitter
County on Sunday was Clarence Leary.
As yet no relatives of the dead man have
been located.
Yosemite Hotels Crowded.
RAYMOND. June sâ Two special en
gines, hauling five sleepers, arrived here
yesterday. The present travel to the
Yosemlte Is the heaviest in years. The !
late rains have put the roads into excel
lent condition. Owing to the large num
ber of tourists In Southern California. I
special cars have been run from Los An
geles. The hotels are crowded. Among
the distinguished guests are the Rocke
feller party the Oliver Anif-s party and
Governor Gape, accompanied by the Y>>
semite Commission. All of these parties ;
have private cars now sidetracked here.
BLOCKS PROSECUTION
OF OPIUM SMUGGLERS
San Quentin Official Refuses to Sur-
render Convicts for
Trial.
SAN RAFAEL, June s.â Captain J. C.
Edgar, representing the ban Quentin Pris
on authorities, and Sheriff Will P. Taylor,
officiating on behalf of Marin County,
came together to-day with a thud that
smashed th> v machinery of the law and re
sulted in confusion. The clashing was the
sequel to what is supposed to have been
the "line w<>rk" of the San Quentin opium
rlne and may ultimately produce the de
sired effect of completely nullifying the
bill adopted by the Legislature making it
a felony to brfng opium or other narcotics
into the prison grounds.
A month ago Walter Furnish and Luis
Perrez, convicts formerly working on the
linr of the Tiburon boulevard, were
thrown into the dungeon lor having smug
gled opium. Both men were raught in the
act and evidence was found on their per
sons. Warden Hal* decided to make a
test cas.- under the new law and had Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac prosecute the men.
Their preliminary examination has oc
curred and to-morrow they will be ar
raigned in the Superior Court.
This afternoon Sheriff Taylor went after
the nun. Captain Edgar, in the absence
of the Warden, refused to surrender them
without an order from the Superior Court.
Judge Angellotti refused to issue such an
oraer, for the reason that he believed he
had no authority to do so. This evening
Hale asserted he would submit the case
to the Attorney General for a decision.
Greal surprise is caused by the reluc
tance of the prison authorities to give the
convicts into the Sheriff's hands.
as their prosecution was under
taken at Male's direct request. It
is alleged his peculiar action is
dv( f> mysterious hints thrown out by the
"opium ring" that when the men were
placed in Taylors hands there was no law
to prevent their being bailed out. when
they could flee the country. If this be
true the new law can never become opera
tive. Competent legal authority, how
ever, claims that such reasoning is ab
surd, as in case the convicts were admit
ted t.i bail, nothing could prevent the pris
on officials Im ing on hand to take them
back to San Quentin.
To Drive Out Nickel Machines.
SAN RAFAEL, June "..âAn ordinance
prohibiting the use of nickel-ln-the-slot
machines "f all kinds was introduced at
the meiting of the Board of Town
Trustees this evening by Trustee Henry
Bchlosser. It was carefully prepared by
Attorneys Thomas P. Boyd and Henry
Eickhoff and makes it a misdemeanor,
punishable by fine and imprisonment, to
Keep any machine of the class named,
whether winnings are paid in cash <>c
trade. The ordinance was introduce at
the requesi of a large number of citizens
on account of the number of boys who
have been in the habit of playing the ma
chines, and undoubtedly it will be adopted
at the next meeting.
Cathedral Poor Boxes Looted.
SACRAMENTO, June 6.â Last night
thieves entered the cathedral here and
robbed the poor boxes. Thrse were of
Iron and riveted to <he walls. They were
pried off and broken. The boxes had
been emptied only a few dilys before and
i i ntalned but small sums. The burglars
made an att< mpt to break open the taber
nacle, but were unsuccessful.

THEY ALL DREAD COUNTY
EXPERT'S PARING KNIFE
CONSTABLE CLAIMS FOR MAY
CONSIDERABLY SLASHED.
Even Uncle Collis Presents a Dupli
cate Bill for One Dollar and Is
Detected by Expert Bul
lock.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 5.
County Export E. B. Bullock's official
. knife is still directed apalnst the claims
: put in by Constables, and many bills put
i in by the constabulary for May came to
\ grief to-day before the Board of Super
visors. Even Coroner Mehrmann is not
i equal to coping with the keen quality of
the expert's scrutiny. In an effort to ob
viate the objections raised to his May
bill. Coroner Mehrmann very carefully
segregated the various items, putting the
undisputed items for inquests, etc., in a
separate bill amounting to $15*. The
charges for removing bodies to the
Morjrue were put into another bill, agrgre
pating $45, while the interments, at $2 per
body, amounting In whole to $28, were in
still another column. In this way the
Coroner had hoped that at least the in
disputable claim for |158 would be prompt
ily allowed. Sup< rvisor Roeth, chairman
of the Finance Committee, removed all
hopes bj laying the whole matter over
until next July.
A duplicate bill from the Southern Pa
! cific Company for $1 "for ground rent for
tank at Livermore," was also rejected
; under the eagle eye at the expert.
Constable P. 1.. White's claim for May.
amounting to $.42, has already been cut
.<:<â¢; 05 on account of error in constructive
â  mileage, and even then the claim was not
allowed because a further reduction is
expected.
Constable Harry Cramer's May claims
amount to $301 15, but Expert Bullock's
paring knife has not yet reached this
batch.
The $105 claim of Constable "Wiedler
and the ?L'2O claim of Constable William
-1 son sustained ;i slight cut and were al
lowed. Constable Joe Rodenick's claim for
I $40 65 from Washington Township was
reduced $12. while his companion Con
stable's bill of $m 55 was justly increased
si 50 on account of a miscalculation.
The bill Of George Cray. Constable Of Ala
meda, was a110w..! as correct. Constable
Ramage of Haywards was permitted to
withdraw his $200 bill for the last four
months, take it home and correct it. The
claim of Larkln Locke, Constable ol
Pleasanton for $50 was found correct and
allowed. The Constables of Emeryville
have tiled no claims for several months,
and it has been gently rumored that they

Jury, but now that Expert Bullock lias
practically usurped this feature of the
Grarfd Jury's duty Emeryville Constables
are at a loss to know where they stand.

A few minutes after the seven got
together the Mayor was apprised by a

and his liv- Supervisors who were
keeping away were taking In loavinK

t;> dispatch the Mayor's secretary.
Colonel Sullivan, tn the board room to
keep an eye peeled for any such resolu
tion and to coach Supervisor Kaib.-n
to enter the proper objection if it be
came necessary.
It was not necpssary. No such resolu
tion was forthcoming, although several
of the majority said afterward that
they were perfectly aware of the
fact that one to that effect could have
been pushed through in the manner in
dicated. Supervisors Aigeltinger and
Holland both said that it was riot the
intention of the majority to take any
snap judgment in regrard to the fran
chises, and, for their part, they pro
â l. a? they had stated in interviews,
that they would take no hand in con
sideration of any franchise until after
the Grand Jury had finished with the
alleged bribery charges. At any rate
.'tft^r th>- meeting was over the Mayor
and the minority breathed easier that
it had not become necessary for them
to go iiiio court to attack the validity
of resolution 2205 and the meeting held
under it. They held that thÂ« resolu
tion was not of any force and that the I
meeting was irregular, and they agreed I
that the. majority had not improved its '
position one iota by holding it. On the
contrary, the Mayor was firmly of the
belief that the seven had cut their own
throats by approving the minutes of
the previous meeting, although It is be
lieved they hope to make some point
against the minority In thÂ« fact that
HOW MAYOR PHELAN
VIEWS THE SITUATION
IN rd Interview yesterday after the adjournment of the seven Super
visors Mayor I'helan was anked for his views concerning their ac
tion. He saiil:
"I think the action of the majority Is nothing short of a victory
for the minority. 1 consider that the majority, by adjourning with
out transacting any business, yielded to the moral force backing the
minority. They hesitated to do anything:, thus acknowledging the posi
tion we have taken. that a meeting has to be called regularly under the
consolidation act.
"Now as to the resolution Tinder which the majority got together. It
was passed at the beginning of the year, not for the purpose of making
a rule for the board, but solely and only as the consensus of opinion of
the members concerning the >lay and the hour it would be most conve
nient for them to meet. If they hold that under that resolution they
must always meet on Monday afternoon, how Is it that since its passage
they have met at other timesâ one Tuesday that I recall and one Thurs
day night?
"Under the consolidation act all meetings except those specially
provided for and those called by the Mayor are adjourned meetings.
Now, at the last meeting they agreed to adjourn by adjourning without
a day. At their so-called meeting to-day they approved the minutes of
the last meeting and thus left themselves without a leg to stand on. They
art- in the air until July 3. the day appointed for the next meeting, un
less 1 shall cull one sooner. I cannot see that the resolution helps them
any.
"In regard to the date of the next meeting, I will consult with the
minority and see if they want to meet next Monday. I will consider the
status of this franchise business and tind out how the members of the
majority feel, and maybe we <an come to some compromise.
'One of the majority members. Supervisor Holland. . told me after
the meeting that he hoped some way could be hit upon so that we could
come together. He says his people at North Beach want the crosstown
railroad. We are all In favor of that if it is granted a franchise under
the terms of the new charter, that !s, for a term of twenty-five years,
with a graded percentage of their recetpts to be turned into the city
treasury and their electric wires put underground. The majority of the
Supervisors wanted to anticipate the charter and grant franchises for
fifty years. Now, what is the matter with us anticipating the charter
by complying with its terms and giving the city the benefit? Nothing
that I can see."
To the Mayor's views on the invalidity of the resolution under which
the seven acted was advanced another. It depended upon the legal
construction of the words, "Further resolved, that the regular weekly
nvtings of the board," etc. It is contended that under the consolida
tion act no such meetings as "regular weekly meetings" are provided
for. It narr.'-s five days upon which meetings shall bo held, and says
nothing about "weekly meetings" at all. The contention is, therefore,
that the seven might just as well have held under a resolution provid
ing for centenary meetings of themselves.
the Perrault motion for reconsideration
was net acted upon.
The majority might not have been in
such ;i hurry to hold their meeting yes
terday had they known that Mayor
Phelan had decided some hours b
that he would call a meeting of thp
board for next Monday. He had al
ready prepared written notices to serve
on all the members, These notices, it
is presumed, will still be used for the
same purpose.
It was 25 minutes of ?, o'clock yester
day afternoon when the spven Super-

visor? marched in single file from the
Clerk's office, where they had been in
consultation, to the meeting room.
They slid quietly into their seats while
Clerk Russell took his place behind the
desk. Producing a typewritten paper,
he read as follows:
To the Clerk of the Board of Super
visorst San Francisco: You will please
take notice ih;it a meeting of rho
Board of Supervisors will be held on
Monday Rfternoon. June n, 1890. at 2
o'clock, pursuant to the provisions of
resolution No. 22n (fourth scries), the.
board at its last meeting having
omitted to fix a date to which the
board would adjourn, and in case of
the absence of his Honor the Mayor
you are hereby instructed to call the
meeting to order, so that a chairman
can be appointed so that the business
of the Board of Supervisors can be
proceeded with.

"In pursuance of thip notice," said
Clerk Russell, "I now, call the board to
order." Supervisor Aigeltinger imme
diately nominated Collins for chair
man. Black seconded the nomination,
and all the votes were cast for the nom
inee. On taking the chair Collins called
for the reading of the minutes of the
memorable meeting at which himself
and the other six were knocked into
parliamentary cocked hats. Clerk Rus
sell had not finished the reading at one
minute to 3 o'clock, when Collins inter
rupted him.
"Is anybody present." he asked, "who
wishes to present a bid for supplies for
the Fire Department? The time is al
most up, there is only a minute left?'
THE SA3T FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUKE 6, 1899.
There was no answer to this appeal,
th< bidders evidently holding the same
opinion of the legality of th.' meeting
as did the Mayor and the minority,
and Collins ordered the clerk to pro
reed to the end. It was reached at last,
and the chair hearing no objection to
the approval of the minutes ordered
th^m approved, thus putting on record
the assent of the majority to the action
of th^ Mayor in adjourning them with
out day and making their future
\ as thorny as possible.
A call by th.' chair for petitions from
members elicited the replies that they
; had none, and the clerk proceeded to
read a large number on file. This con
sumed another fifteen minutes, durinp
Which the seven were momentarily ex
pecting another summons from the
Grand Jury to the farce. It did
not come and they wpre compellpd to
sit it out, cold-footed as they were he
coming, until the last communication
was read. Then, quicker than a wink.
Chairman "'ollins announced that the
. opening of bids for Fire Department
supplies would bo postponed until next
; Monday. AigHting^r made a motion to
i adjourn until that day at 2 o'clock.
There were several seconds and a unan
imous vote for the motion and the
short-lived bluff was ended.
Before and after the sitting of the.
Beven the Mayor and the members of
the minority held consultations con
cerning the situation and seemed to be
wen pleased at the state of affairs.
They all were <rf opinion that the fran
chise matter was knocked out, the more
so that Kalben had seceded on that
proposition at any rate. This feeling
was enhanced when Supervisor Hol
land, who, seemed to be sneaking: for
. the others of the majority, voiced the
; hope that "all would Ret together.' 1

AFTER their meeting yesterday
"all by their lonelies" the ma
jority Supervisors, with the ex
ception of Supervisor Kalben,
who had been there before, has
tened to the Grand Jury room, where
they had been summoned to give tes
timony regarding the statements at
tributed to Supervisor Kalben that
there hud been bribery in the beard.
Jn addition to the six. Supervisor
Heyer of th<> minority had also been
subpenaed. Supervisor Phelps, who
had admitted in a conversation before
a witness thut he had overlooked an
opportunity to make half of $6000, was
the first witness called. He was inside
more than half an hour, and looked
when he came out as if he h;id had a
trying time of it. He was closely ques
tioned by District Attorney Murphy in
reference to the conversation related
to the Grand Jury by John D. Spreck
els, who said that Phelps had admitted
that he had overlooked a chance to
make $6000, and that he, being a poor
man, did not propose to miss another
opportunity. Phelps admitted having
had such a conversation, but said that
Mr. Spreckels must have misunder
stood. J 1 is version of the story was
that he told Mr. Spreekels that he had
heard, in a general way, that he could
have made $6000. He denied that he
had told Mr. Rpreekels that he was of
fered that money.
Phelps admitted that ho had been
spoken to hy Henry H. Lynch about the
franchises, but denied that Lynch had
ever offered him money for his vote.
PhHps was followed by Supervisor
Heyer, who was on thf stand only a
short time. In answer t < > questions
concerning bribery in the hoard, iv
said he knew nothing except the ru
mors mentioned by Supervisor Kalben.
Supervisor Holland absolutely de
nied that he kn"w anything of bribery
in the board. He, too. he said, had
heard the rumors, hut had never seen
iho passing of any consideration. In
regard to tho "corkscrew" franchise,
he said he favored it because he
thought hif< constituents wanted a
rropstown line. Another consideration
he had was in the knowledge that rail
way bonds could not be floated in the
money centers of the world if their life
was less than forty years. That was
why he favored the fifty-year fran
chise..
Supervisor Aigeltinger succeeded
Holland in tho jury room. He denied
that any consideration had Influenced
him in voting for the franchise? other
than that he had thought it was a pood
thing. He Baid he had conversed with
sfVf.-ral friends about it and they had
advised him that It was a desirable
franchise to let. He said he had voted
for the others on th^ same grounds.
Supervisors Collins. Hlack and At
tridge went before the jury in the order
named and denied that they had been
Influenced by other than good motives
in voting for the franchises. Each said
that he knew nothing of bribery in the
board.

DID NOT KILL HER
Ward's Wife Tells Her Tale of Woe.
THERE is no remorse in the heart of Dennis Ward, the longshore
man who almost succeeded in kicking his wife into eternity on Sunday
night. Ward was arrested yesterday morning by Detectives Ryan and
ODea and Police Officer . Regan. A charge of battery was lo< 1 <<\
against him and bail fixed at $500 cash.
Yesterday the condition of Mrs. Ward was? considered so serious
that she was confronted with the brute she calls husband, and in his
presence and that of Detective Ryan and Officer Regan made a statement
of the lads of the assault.
The poor woman's pitiful recital was frequently interrupted by the man.
who was the cause of all her suffering. "He kicked me on many other oc
casions," she moaned.
"You lie," he shrieked, and the long line of sufferers patiently enduring
pnin in the common ward of the County Hospital Involuntarily stuffed
their fingers in their ears, while a few of the convalescents uttered a warn
ing hush.
Mrs. Ward's story was a long tale of abuse, privation and want. "He
was a brute when he was drunk, and not much better when he was sobber,"
she said. 'â¢Saturday night he chased me out of the house after striking me.
On Sunday night, when he came home, he was drunk. He kicked me many
times, and dragging me i t 1 1 < > the kitchen, threatened to get a knife and .kill
me. His cousin, Con Ward, was in the room, and although Con was also con
siderably tlic worse for liquor he Game to my rescue."
â Tart of that statement Is true." said the unnatural husband, "but the
greater part is .-ill lies. My life with the woman has been an awful one. I
have no peace with her. She was awfully jealous of me and continually ac
cused me of guing with other women. 1 was drunk on Sunday night, and
may have kicked her Once, but no more. I'm only sorry that I did not kill
h*--r. As it is. J would willingly do six years just to be rid of her for that
time."
The wife ridicules the husband's tale of jealousy. "It was not jealousy,"
sh'^ said, "thut madf me upbraid him. It was hunger. I wanted food for
my children and for myself."
The Wards have been married nine years, and s^ven littlf ones have called
the injured woman mother. Of the seven, but four now survive, the eldest
8 boy 'of eight, and the youngest a babe just three months old.

Five-Year-Old Frank Elliott Falls
Twenty Feet to the Sidewalk.
Frank Klliott, a five year-old hoy living
at 3 Rincon placo, fell from the roof of a

DECLINED TO HONOR
HIS SIGNATURE
ABE FRIEDLANDER ARRESTED
FOR PETTY LARCENY.
Destroys a Note He Had Signed and
Then Inflicts a Beating on the
Man Who Tried to Collect It.
Abraham Friedlander, son of E. Fried
lander, a manufacturer of ladles' and
children's underwear, was arrested yes
terday on a warrant sworn to by Louis
Martin and charged at the City Prison
with petty, larceny. The charge was based
on Friedlander's action in destroying 1 a
note for $20 which he is alleged to have
signed and took that means of avoiding
paying it. â 
" Louis Martin, a cigar dealer, is the com
plaining witness, and he says he intends
prosecuting-Friedlander because of his al
leged assault on him and for his refusal
to honor the note. According to his story,
about a month ago Friedlander contracted
a debt at. Martin's cigar store and after
assuring the proprietor of his willingness
to meet the bill, gave him three notes in
amounts of $20 each. As he did not wish
his father to learn of his indebtedness,
Friedlander paid two of the notes, but
on the third being presented to him he
is alleged to have flatly refused to honor
it and also to have showed his disregard
for the cigar dealer by tearing It up and
consigning him and. the pieces to the ut
termost depths. Martin says he was loth
to part with his goods' gratis, so he paid
a visit to the elder Friedlander at his
place of business at 14 Gutter street and
appealed to him to settle the indebted
ness, but he declined to do so While
Martin was discussing the matter with
the father the son r enraged at * the for
mer's action, rushed forward and accord
ing to Martin attempted to do the cigar
dealer an injury. Friends Interfered for
the moment, but Friedlander was said to
be still determined to inflict punishment
on Martin and to have sprang forward
a second time. His mother and father
in their efforts to shield Martin from in
