Mr. Churchill said:
"The Boers have treated us with much

the confinement In the model school was
close and severe, but under all the con

When asked regarding his general Impres

the number who could speak English. He
had found that most of them regretted

END OF THE REVOLT
IS NOT FAR DISTANT
WASHINGTON. Nov. 24.-Havlnir ac
complished the disintegration of Aguin
aldo's army the energies of Generals Law
ton and Mac Arthur are now being di
rected toward crushing small bands
formed by the fleeing insurgents. The
President and his Cabinet are satlfled
to-night that the Insurrection Is nearlcg
TRICK FIVK CENTS.
i a close, with Agulnaldo a fugitive, ie
companion*, perhaps by only a few faith
ful followers, with members of hi* Cab
inet and the president of hi* congress In
General Otis' hands, and with the army
dispersed. It Is apparent that the admin
istration can shortly commence the peace
ful pacification of the Island. It hi to b*>
expected that military operations will
have to continue until the Insurgent
bands have Â»,Â»w.r, destroyed: that the dis
turbed condition will last for some
time; that military rule will be ner*Â«nary:
but when the ill-feelintr generated by the
present strife has disappeared a civil ad
ministration will be established and the
President will show by his action that his
fair promises are to be carried out.
Instead of .Agulnaldo being In thÂ» north
ern provinces of Luzon General Ods
states that he fled westward from Bay
amhong railway station. His flight In
this direction Is an evidence, the official*
believe, that he dared not trust the
northern tribes, hut preferred to remain
among hiÂ« own countrymen. It Is un
derstood that General Mac Arthur will de
vote his attention to the section of Luzon
in which Aguinaldo la supposed to be In
ling
"It will be a very difficult matter to cap
ture Aguinaldo." said IÂ»reÂ»ident Schur
man of the Philippine Commission to mo
to-night. "Should remove his gen
erals uniform and don the habiliments of
a peasant Filipino how many American
soldiers would l>e able to recognize him?
While it might be desirable to capture
Aguinaldo. yet the destruction of h|j4
army and of the bar. formed as the re
sult of its disintegration will end the
I Insurrection. AgutnaMo without an army
Is helpless. The military will naturally
bare to continue their operations until the
Insurgents have been entirely destroyed.
The government of the Island Is a matter
under discussion by the commission, and
a report will be submitted probably In
January. It remains with the President
to determine whether this commission
will return to Manila to assist in the es
tablishment of the civil administration.
"It was very gratifying to me to notÂ«
that General Lawton, when he passed
thÂ« Tacal- belt, was able to live off tho

aldo. but under hi- Instruction his troops
entered various provinces, seized the gov
ernments and established military depots,
and the feeling caused as a consequence
may have deterred him from attempting
to seek refuge among them."
Colonel Deni also of the Philippine
Commission, considers the capture of
Agulnaldo as absolutely essential to the
establishment of peace throughout Lu
zon Island.
"General Otis' latest dispatch Is very
gratifying." be said to-night, "and shows
that the end 1- very near, but Agulnaldo
must be taken If there Is to be a perma
nent ending of the Insurrection. When It
comes to analyzing the Influence Airuln
aldo has over the Tan It Is difficult
to find a reason for It. but there Is no de
nying that he has had n strong following,
and until he Is captured there Is always
bound to be more or less trouble amonc
his adherents, however few they may be."

CHICAGO. Nov. 24.â Interest In to-day's
session of the sub-committee of the in
dustrial Commission centered in the ad
dress mado by Zena It. Carter, former
president of the Chicago Board of Trade,
on the question of building a ship canal
from the Great Lakes to' the Gulf. Ac
cording to Mr. Carter, the development of
Commerce depends largely upon the im
provement of ihe waterways of this coun
try. He declared the Great Lake-to-Gulf
pxoject feusible.
Joseph H. Tucker, chairman of the Cen
tral Grain Association of Chicago, said
that complaint of high grain rates was
less freiiuent than In former years and
that little discrimination is practiced by
the railroads. He defended the legalited
pooling. I'nrestricted competition, he de
c'ared. was ruinous to all classes.
J. F. Wofflngton. chairman of the ?â¢.il
cago committee of the Central Freight
Association, also defended legalized pool
ing.
J. T. Hipley. chairman of the Western
classification committee, declared that
great benefit would result from a uniform
classification, which might be made pos
sible throuph national legislation.
Joseph Bookwalti-r. chairman of the
transportation committee of the Kansas
City Board of Trade, was the last wit
ness of thr morning session. His testi
mony, along the line of Zena R. Carter's
arguments, concluded the sessions of the

the final day's sessions.
KRUTTSCHNITT ON COST
OF MAIL TRANSPORTATION
Vice President of the Southern Pacific
Appears Before the Congres
sional Commission.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24.â The Congres
sional Commission which has been In ses
sion here conducting the examination Into
the cost of mail transportation concluded
Its work as far as New York City was
concerned to-day. The commission will
not present Its report to Confess until
after December JÂ». and In the meantime
will hold further examinations in Wash
ington.
The commission to-day heard the testi
mony of J. C Kruttsehnltt. vice president
of the Southern Pacific Railroad, who ap
peared on behalf of the railroad com
pany. Mr. Kruttschnltt explained that
under present conditions the business of
mail carrier as undertaken by the railroad
companies was certainly not a source of
great profit to the corporations. He did
not agree, with the official statistics, which
placed the average haul of mails at 32S
miles. The statistics which he had pre
pared agreed favorably with those given
by Professor H. C. Adams yesterday, to
the effect that the ... was SC6
miles.
Mr. Kruttschnitt paid that the railroad
companies objected to carrying publica
tions and magazines at the present rate.
"These are full of advertisements." he
said, "and although they contain reading
matter the proportion is often only on a
ratio of 1 In 3. If in the wisdom of Con
gress It Is deemed best to carry that mat
ter at a cost less than It should be I don't
think the railroads should be forced to do

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.â
Representative Sulzer's arrival here to
day gave additional impetus to the con
test for .he empty honor of leading the
Democratic minority In the House of
Representatives. â 
Mr. Sulzer comes from his attendance
at the meeting of the National Democrat
ic Committee at Chicago and he clams
that the national leaders of the party fa
vor his selection as leader of the min
ority on the ground that It would be
good politics to bestow the honor on an
Eastern man. It Is further urged by Mr.
Sulzer's friends that he desires recog
nition because of the gallant light he
made for Bryan and free silver In New
York contrary to the advice of Air.
Croker.
It remains to be seen what effect this
argument will have upon the Democratic
members when they reach Washington.
At present there are almost as many can
didates for the minority leadership in
â  town as there are Democratic members.
1 At the postolfioe of the House of Repre
sentatives but thirteen members are
known to be In the city. Five of th-Â»se
are from New York. In addition to Sul
zit. Amos Cummingi George B. McClel
lan, John J. Fitzgerald and B. T. Clay
ton are here to push alone the Suizer
boom. Representative William D. Daly
of New Jersey also Is actively at work
at Bulser's headquarters, which are locat
ed at the Chamberlain. Corporation Attor
ney Chilricrs of New York, who has a
large ac [Ualntancesblp with Southern
Representatives, Is here In the Interest of
Sulzer. The supporters of Sulzer claim
that they will have the solid Democratic
vote of the New York and New Jersey
delegations in addition to a largo at
tering vote in the South and West.
Amos '"ummings will present Sulz^r's
name in Congress and the nomination.
will be seconded by a well-known South
ern man, whose name will not be dis
closed at present.
At Representative Bankhead's hr.id
quarters in the Rlggs House hut little act
ive canvassing was done to-day. Bank
head informed me to-night that nearly
all of the Southern and Western Demo
crats would come to Washington un- !
pledged, ns they bad In reply to written
suggestions fiaid that they did not care j
to commit themselves In advance. Bai.k
j head says there are so few members in
the city i hat he will take things easy till
next week, when there will be more Con
gressional material to work upon. He is
quite satisfied with his chances and Is
counting upon receiving Sulzer's support
i should it become apparent that the New
i York man cannot win.
Bankhoad is not responsible for the
statement, but it Is freely asserted at his
headquarters, that the real contest Is be
tv.'oen Mr. Richardson and Mr. Bankhoad
i and at the proper time, at the command
i of Mr. broker, the strength of th.- New
â¢ York delegation will be thrown to Bank
head. It Is also said that the friends of
Representative Bailey of Texas, who r<Â»
elgned the leadership of the minority in.
th.- last Congress, will unite In support of
Bankhead to punish Richardson and his
friends for antagonizing Bailey.
In the meantime Richardson is making
a systematic canvass, supported by some <
i of the most Influential members of the
minority. He Mas not established head
quarters at ary of the public houses, but
is making a house-to-house visit to mem- ;
bers as they arrive. He had a long and
friendly consultation with Bankhead to
day.
Mr. de Armond of Missouri Is practi
cally out of the- running. His supporters
probably will go to Richardson, who ap
pears to be the favorite at the present
writing. ________^_____

At Carroll Hall this afternoon the re
mains of Vice President Hobart lay In
state, and the- public hud an opportunity
to view them. Fully 5000 persons were In
the streets. Lines were formed by a squad
of police, but the force was entirely too
small. \\'Â«men were largely in the ma
jority. They included all classes, and all
had the same opportunity to take a last
look at the face of the dead. The Drat
person to see the remains after they had
' â¢Â«â¢â¢ removed from the room where Vice
President Hobart died was Attorney Gen
eral Griggs. He shook his head as he no
ticed the change in the. face of the dead,
and as he stepped aside from the room,
very much affected, he remarked: "He
has suffered muchâ more than any one
will know."
As the throngs filed Into the hall leading
to the library excitement began to ap
pear. Women fainted on the porch, and
at one time a half-dozen lay Insensible on
the lawn, but wore revived. At the cof
fin there was a fainting scene. A woman
about 20 years old. after gazing In the
face of the dead Vice President, stood as
thoroughly transfixed. Then she screamed
and fell forward into the arms of a police
man. She was placed on a chair and re
vived. It was estimated that fully 12.000
persons saw the remains In the four hours
they were exposed to view. Thousands
more would have seen them if the time
had permitted.
It was remarked by those who had
known the Vice President that the face
had lost its pleasant roundness and was
very thin, showing that he had suffered
much. His neck had also thinned consid
erably and his hair and mustache were
gray. He was sadly chanced from the
day he was sworn Into the office of Vice
President of the United States, but there
was a peaceful expression, as though he
had dropped Into a sleep.

ATTORNEY MULLANY

Arraigns All the Plaintiff's Witnesses
in the Orilfln Will Case, Includ
ing Father Rogers.

of counsel In tlu' (Jrifllii will cont.-Mt w. r.
finished to-day and the case went to the
Jury at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon. Ju-lg.;
AnseUottTfl charge to the jury r.
thirty minutes and was commended by
buth sides f<>r Its Impartiality.
The argument of Attorney Mich Mul
lany took up most of the forenoon and
was a masterpiece Of Invective. The
plaintiff ami every unÂ« of his witnesses
received a merciless scorching, Muiiuny
trying to make it appear that the contest
was a piece of effrontery and the testi
mony of ail the defendant's witnesses
biased and unreliable. Not even Rev.
Father Rogers of Tomales was spare i.
"This man Mulvaney hovers like a vult
ure over this estate," declared the law
yer, "'ever wailing for an opportunity
to Belce a rii"rsÂ«Â»L This priest. Father
Rogers, who testified in his favor I* a
stuck-up piece â â : humanity and unworthy
the coniiuer.co reputed in him because of
his sacred calling. He should never have
unfrocked himself by appearing on the
stand and divulging the secrets confided
to him by a parishioner."
Attorney Keyes closed th* argument for
the plaintiff In an eloquent speech,
listened to attentively by the Jury for
two hours. In defense of Father Rogers
he said the priest was a dignified man,
who had the confidence of his parishion
ers and his superiors; that ho atfended
court in obedience to a â Ã¼bpena the same
as any other citizen; that h.< had volun
teered nothing and had even been re
luctant In telling what he knew. As for
the plaintiff. Keyes said he was fighting
for Ellen (Jriffln's grandchildren and not
for himself and that his cause was just.
At 11:4.*. p. m. the Jury sent for Judge
Angellottl and stated their inability to
agree. Accordingly the Jury was dis
charged. The disagreement virtually
means a victory for Mnllany, as the case
Is now likely to be compromised.

Nino-tenths of Miller's patrons, affect
ed by the money-making fever, were In
the habit oi turning around and reinvest-
Ing the JO per cent interest, or. in other
j words, pyramiding their gains One of
Miller's patrons who Invested $100 Im
mvOlately turned around and reinvested
the 10 per cent allowed him at the end of
; the tirxt wot-k. making- a balance of $110
to his credit. The next week he received
Interest on both principal and Interest,
thus giving him a balance to his credit
of $121. At the end of twenty-flve weeks,
or a little less than Fix months, he found
j himself with a credit la the Franklin
Syndicate of $1028 All this from the orig-
I inal investment of $100. Inasmuch as Ma
ler absolutely refused to carry accounts
! <'f more ttan 11000 this customer was
â¢ compelled to reinvest In the names of
i other members of his family. At the
j time of Miller's arrest he saJd that he
had over $3'.n)o In the syndicate, all from
the original Investment of $100.
This policy of reinvesting in the name of
I other members of the family was carried
ion to a large extent among the poorer
class In Brooklyn. One of the police cap
tains In Brooklyn said that be knew of
a family lonsistlng of sixteen members
| which had $lw invested for each mem
ber of the family 7..1 the Interest was
paid on ill of the sixteen claims regularly
every week.
MUler claimed to make his abnormal
proiits through speculation In Wall street
though no evidence is forthcoming up to
the present tÂ«. show that he ever specu
j lated in Mocks to any extent. His clerks
and employes from time to time threw
' 2M5i Â£ ac,,a c ,, Jar,- of lnsld *' Information
! which Miller, they alleged, possessed
j tor Instance, at the outbreak of tho
I bpanlsh- American war it was claimed
I that Miller made Immense profits irom
â¢ the Cuban bonds and despite the fact
, that these bonds have been anything ex
cept a. favorite form of Investment with
llnanciers s;neo that time, they succeeded
In making thousands of the poor people
In Brooklyn believe the story. Late*- it
â¢ was announced that Miller was in with
! a Senatorial clique at Washington from
i whom he received tips on tho market
(and that he used this information for the
U-nefit of his syndicate. Still anotner
i story extensively circulated was the
| statement that he had recently made 25
i per cent proiit in a single day in a trans
; continental railway stock speculation
i this despite the fact that since Miller
j commenced his operations no transconti
: nental railroad stock has moved uu or
! down 2S prints.
| On Tuesday of this week Miller Is said
i to nave taken In $MI.OOO and paid out $31.-

one of the bank* who visited Miller's of-
Hce about this time said that be never

KRUGER MUST OBSERVE
THE RULES OF HUMANITY
WASHINGTON. Nov. 24.-Representa
tions are to be made to the Kruger Gov
ernment In behalf of Hritish prisoners of
war held In the Transvaal. Consul
Macrum at Pretoria la ordered to present
to the Government of the South African
republic that It Is the practice of all na
tions to permit the representative of a
friendly power to act for one of the com
batants In time of war and that the with
drawal of this privilege in the present
is contrary to the instincts of hu
manity. Consul Macrum Is instructed to
insist upon performing the duties which
were assigned to him under the arrange
ment made at the outbreak of hostilities.
and in the event Of a new refusal he Is
ordered to demand an explanation.
The matter has been under considera
tion by the State Department since Mr.
sfacrum advised Secretary Hay that the
Transvaal Government had declined to
permit him to disburse moneys among
British prisoners or to send each week a
list of their names und condition of their
health, us desired by the British Govern
ment, on the ground that theye were mat
ters which would be dealt with by tho
military' authorities. The department
quickly reached the conclusion that tho
position assumed by tho Kruger Govern
ment was Indefensible. Consul Macrum
pannot, of course, formally npres.-nt
them or their Government and be will not
; :-k to be allowed to do so. The extent of
ills representation will be as stated above.
There Is no intention that he shall com
municate any news concerning Boer
movements, for the attitude assumed by
Urn I'nited States in the war is one of
strict neutrality, and this will not be de
parted from under any circumstances.

LONDON. Nov. 25.â The Daily Tele
graph publishes the following from Capo
Town, dated Thursday: "Refugees, who
have arrived hero from Pretoria, report
that President Kruger looked extremely
wellâ much better than he did a while
ago. The Boers had a complete plan of
campaign worked out montha ago and had
a splendid Intelligence department. They
were confident of winning. Some of them
have even issued invitations for a Christ
mas dinner at Durban, and others for a
champagne lunch in Mafeklng. They still
seriously think they will get the British
country after a campaign lasting from
four to six months. They have been
strengthened in this conlidenco by the
great number of British prisoners secured
and by the Important arrival of reinforce
ments. The total Boer force Is put at
43,000. which closely agrees with General
Joubert's estimate. The men who wero
loaf at Elands Laagta were mainly Ger
mans. Hollanders and Irish, all of whom
are despised by the Boers and wero put
well In front."
SURPRISED THE BOERS.
DURBAN. Natal. Nov. 24.-An official
message from General White at Lady
smith, dated November 22. says:
-Situation unchanged. Troops well and
cheerful."
The Natal Advertiser confirms the re
port of fighting near Willow Grange. It
snys: "Five thousand Hrltish left Est
court on Wednesday afternoon for a re
oonnolssance. They surprised the Boers
at 3 o'clock on Thursday morning and oc
cupied the Hoer position, bayoneting
eighty of the enemy. At daybreak the
Hoers opened with quick-firers. The Brit
ish artillery was unable to reach the
ltoers. and the British position therefore
V>ecamo untenable and was evacuated.
Subsequently the artillery was brought
into the action and the Boers fell back.
Their object having been attained, the
British returned to Estcourt."
KIPLING AS A TALKER.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â Rudyard Kipling,
addressing a branch of the Navy League
this evening at Rottingdean, near Bright
on, said the object of the league was to
crer.te a certain public opinion which
should announce lta willingness to pay
taxes in order that the British navy might
be efficient and strong and might not fall
th .T British people In the hour of need.
"We did not realize what our navy
meant," said the speaker, "until we saw
it taking away a small police detachment
of 66.000 men, with mules, horses and hun
dreds of tons of stores, to get at some
people who have interfered with our ideas
of right and wrong at a distance of 60U0
miles."

J. F. SHEEHAN JR.
FROM sat autumn until Thanks
giving day of each year the inter
collegiate game of foothill holds the
attention of thousands of Ameri
cans of every class. Especial interest is
being centered in the various sections of
the country upon the result of the match
games between the rival teams of the
larger educational institutions. Eight
years aco the sport, in the higher sense
of Its development, was confined almost
wholly to the universities of Harvard.
Tale and Princeton, the teams of which,
by reason Of years of experience and the
wealth of sturdy athletic material,
formed a class by themselves. In the
eÂ»rly nineties, however, graduates of
these three Eastern colleges, experts In
the science of the grfrflron game, com
menced to give their knowle.lge to the so
called minor universities, and the dawn
of a new football era was marked. To
Pennsylvania went Woodruff of Yale the
Inventor of the "guard's back" forma

and the adoption of stricter methods,

her success is largely Oue to her alumniâ

McClung to Berkeley, and the football

may be answered in really no more than
a theoretical manner by a brief compari
son of the conditions as they exist to-day
in the East and in our State, with also an
eye to the prowess of the individual foot
ball hero of each section.
Big as ihe East Is. with its many di
versified sporting interests alive at all
sr&ttona ol the year, football stands
premier in the autumn months Genera
tions of college graduates have given even
the commercial, aside from the profes
sional world, a university tone, and us
men are but grown-up boys. The great
alumni l>odle.Â« of the colleges follow
every step in the development of the team
of their alma mater with a feverish in
terest. The non-college population must
necessarily catch the fever and so the
Castcrn world Is agug with excitement
over the gridiron war.
Commercing with tlio Ist of October the

times originality of play, wnicii in Itself
tends to bring out all there is In the vari
ous candidates for university honors. It
relegates, many during tho first two weeks
of the r.eason to obscurity and on the
other hand showing possibilities -of
greater deeds in others. In this respect
how apparent it is that football develop
ment in California Is sadly handicapped
for want of more strong opponents tor ihe
two university elevens. While all praise
must be given the Olympic Athletic Club
for maintaining a pplmdid eleven during
this and many reasons of the past, it is
nevertheless it fact that our preliminary
schedule has developed into a stale one.
both to the public and to the players of
California and Stanford. The Innovation
of match games with Nevada and Oregon
Is a step toward Eastern conditions.
Twenty years of football have given
Yale, Princeton and Harvard a woll-pct-
Ued policy of development, the last named
\jnlvcnslty, however, only reaching a suc
cessful stage tyro years ago. while Penn
pvlvanla has scarcely demonstrated that
the possesses a stability of system. So
It must be noted with plenty of hope for
our Vest em gam< that age counts for a
great leal.
The three colleges of greatest football
prestige train their men under conditions
which to one accustomed to our Western
crudity must wem almost Ideal. Observe
the ncene at the big institution on an or
dinary practice day. even â  arly in the sea

miracle which only Sons of Old Ell seem
capable ofâ putting a "green" team to

At Harvard It was much the same. only,
if anything, the candidates were more nu
merous. Compared with our Western
simplicity. It certainly seemed like .1 "bus
iness." a well conducted business where
every detail has its place.
So much for the generality of the situ
ation us it Impressed me. As for differ
ence in component phases, of which there
are many, the moat striking was the
power of the head trainer, especially evi
dent at Harvard and Yale, M. Ma- 1 at
tho former university and Robinson at the
latter are solely responsible for the physi
cal condition of the men. A man plays or
ba does not play at the word of the traln

ins Al Lean in charge, Stanford advances
to thÂ«? Eastern standard this year for the
first time, when Dr. Murphy. Yale's old
Â»..Â«ll player, was retained to handle the
athletic teamÂ«.
As to the men themselves, of whom one
seems to lose sight in the Eastern dis
courses on "T'niversity Policy." Do they
play like the men of Stanford and Berke
ley of the past and of the present? Divide
the question und it may be more easily
answen-d. Individually the difference Is
certainly not particularly noticeable. I
would venture a personal opinion, backed
by that of Eastern players who have seen
our men perform, that Ransome. Walton,
Clematis, Friinkenlu-lmer. Sherman. Hunt.
Harrelson. Wilson of Berkeley. Downing,
Sneehy, Morse. Carter, Code, Cotton
Carle. Fickert. Prlngle Womble.
Smith. Hall and Murphy, and certainly
numerous others, would easily fit a big
Eastern team.
Indeed, our material here has been pro
nounced as strong, as supple and as quick
and possessed of equally as clever natural
attributes as that of Yale. Harvard.
Princeton and Pennsylvania. More would
have been got out of any one of the
men mentioned had they played on East
ern fieldsâ obviously enough because of
conditions far more favorable They
would have received better preliminary
training, been taught to "keep their eyes
open" in all sorts of play, to "use their
head" to better obtain advantageâ in
short, to obtain the finesso of develop
ment, although their mere rushing power
or defensive cleverness might not have
been materially Improved. Indeed. Stan
ford's teams of '93. *96 and '97 and Califor
nia's of '94 (while beaten, was certainly*
possessed of wonderful strength) and of
fiS would bother nny of the big Eastern
elevens and In some instances certainly
score by reason of the general Individual
equality.
l'n.l. r the vastly more favorable con
ditions, team work Is developed to a
nicety: the play, owing partly to the
cool, sharp, bracing weather and the
never ceasing prodding of many coach
rs. is immeasurably faster ami fiercer.
Aided by more clever generalship, an
average Eastern team on the day of
.1 big match is a manifestly stronger ag
gregation than any the West has yet put
forth. Our Western game has developed
more quickly than that of our Eastern
brothers at a like period, and with the
zeal of youth we may close the. pap in
shorter time than many imagine.

GARDEN CITY
GOLFERS HAVE
A NEW COACH
Will Establish the Game on a
Good Foundationâ Club
Gossip.
David Stephenson, the professional of
the San Francisco Golf Club, has gone to
i San Jose to Instruct the members of the
, newly formed Linda Vista Golf Club In
j the rudiments of the royal and ancient
game and to lay out their links to the
i be.st advantage. During his absence Hor
ace Rawllns, one of the Instructors of the
Oakland Golf Club, Is at the Presidio
links, which are being placed In good con
dition and improved. E. Conde Jones of
the Los Angeles Country Club Is on a visit
to Ban Francisco and has been playing
frequently on the Presidio course with li.
B. Goodwin. It 13 hoped that he may be
Induced to stay here long enough to enter
the contest for the amateur championship
of the Pacific Coast, to begin on Satur
day, December 9. at the Presidio links.
Mr. Jones is one of the strongest play
era in Southern California. C. E. Maud of
Riverside and W. Cosby of the Los Ange
les Country Club having been the only
men to defeat him in the men's champion
ship contest held over the new course of
the Country Club on the 4th inst. On the
Old links at Los Angeles Mr. Jones won
the club championship with a score of
161" for thirty-six boles. He also won the
Banning cup in a tournament on the.
Santa catallna Island links.
As some of the Presidio golfers are ill,
| absent from the city or otherwise unable
to play, the tournament set for Thanks
â¢ giving day will be postponed.
The Oakland golfers have lately allowed
their schedule to go by the board, but on
Thanksgiving day they will go back and
gather up one of the dropped stitches.
There will be on that day mixed four
somes, eight.-, holes, m.'itch play, with
handicap, the winning couple to receive
silver trophies. There will also be a re
ception and music at the clubhouse.
On Thanksgiving day at the San Rafael
links there, will be a general tournament
open to members of any golf club, the
principal events being an elghteen-hole
competition, match play, for men and a
nine-hole contest, match play, for women.
Play will begin at 9 o'clock In the morn
ing and will continue all day. The iinal
rounds In both competitions will be play
ed off on th. following Saturday.
When the Ighteen-bole course of the
San Rafael Golf Club Is completed there
will be three lull courses on the Pacific
Coast, the other two being thofie of the
Los Angeles Country Club and of the Th
coma Golf Club. The latter, organized In
1594, la the pioneer in that part of the
Northwest, and has an excellent elghteFn
bole course on the prairie to the south of
Tacoma. It covers an area of about 300
acres. Lengthwise through the grounds
runs a water ditch, which must be crossed
in playing for the second, eleventh, four
teenth and sixteenth holes. On each side
of the water-way is a cycle path, which
begins In the city of Tacoma and forms
part of the thirty-six miles of path con
structed from the dollar-a-year license
fund. The links are also easily reached
by good roads for driving, by the street
cars and by the suburban line steam cars.
Four cottages serve as a clubhouse, one
being reserved for women and another for
men. In a third are the kitchen and res
taurant, and the fourth is the home of
the gieeukeeper and his family. Looking
in every direction from the clubhouse fine
forests of fir and cedar are seen, and from
the eleventh green a magnificent view of
Mount Ranter is obtained. Regular month
ly competitions for email prizes are held
by the club, the value of the rewards be
ing based on the number of entries. On
New Year's day a competition is held for
the Balfour medal, a trophy presented by
Sir Robert Balfour, who is an enthusiastic
golfer and a partner of Alexander Baillle.
president of the Tacoma Golf Club. Sir
Robert belongs to the firm of Balfour,
Outhri- &Co The trophy Is played for at
thirty-six holes, medal play, the highest
handicap that may be given In the com
petition being twelve strokes. The medal
remains the property of the club, tin win
ner receiving â â¢â¢ sovereign suitably In
scribed as a memento of his victory.
On Thanksgiving day two cups, present
ed three years ago by Chester Thome,
Jesse Merrill and others, are playeJ for,
one being for women and the other
for men. On Lincoln's birthday the women
play for the Tiilinrhast gold medal, pre
sented by F. Tllllnghast. There are va
rious other trophies to be played for. and
the members display much enthusiasm.
The best players are Mrs. Melbourne
Baltay and Mrs. Stewart Rico, who have
won prizes on the links of Portland, Seat
tle and Victoria. Among the men W. A.
Eborley holds the record for the clghteen
hole course, while Charles Malott is only
on.- stroke behind. The latter Is a steady
player and can almost always be counted
on to make a low score. The officers of
the Tacoma Golf Club are: Alexander
Kaillle, president: Stuart Rice, captain;
Jess Merrill, secretary and treasurer. The
first annual championship meeting of the
â¢Pacific Northwest Golf Association v.-is
held on the Tacoma links on April 19, 20.
21 and 22. and was successful. The club
has about seventy "resident" and ten
"non-resident" members among the men.
while about seventy women, wives nnil
sisters of the resident members, are
classed as "honorary members." Most of
the non-resident members reside in Seat

STANFORD MEN
ARE IMPROVING
They Develop Rapidly as the Day ot the
Big Annual Game Approaches.
F. â¢ la'l gridiron
watrtufs journeyed from thf
"â¢;in(r and gridiron turmoil to <*
foreign field. Each time they re
turned home without gladdening victory,
albeit but four defeats marked the en
counters with their natural rivals. Stan
ford. The eighth year a wise man of the
East came to their help and under his
pilotage their ship was steered through
the middle course of success. That same
man is with them again and they think
they cannot lose In this, the ninth ordeal
of arm.Â«.
Another wise man of the East Is guiding
the destinies of th.- other band of football
warriors who dock themselves with cardi
nal. He also has won fame on the Held
of kicks and pigskins. Back Of hi: and
his forces Is an enthusiastic student body,
ready to shout at any time. The differ
ence between the point of view of the
Blue and Gold shouter and the Cardinal
whooppr-up is this in the essence: Stan
ford if satisfied that the possibility of .â .
victory Is left to them; California I* al
most insolent in Its belief that to the Car
dinal will come a bitter and a crushing
defeat
But few days now remain before the big
annual game which brings the rival col
leges face to face on the field of football
battle. Those few days are Oiled with
doubt, misgiving and every kind of labor
that calls the Imagination into play That
this year's game will prove a hard, close
engagement Is the opinion of many.
California's strength is known to the gen
eral football-going public. The team's
strength Is neither greater nor leal than
It was two weeks ago. when the Olympics
â offered defeat at its hands by a score of
17â0. That was the best finance the
BhM and Gold has given this season.
Laboring under heavy difficulties at the
beginning of the reason. Chamberlain was
forced to expend much of the valuable
time, usually y. -n to preparatory work.
In the sifting of material. At this .ate day
he- has his team together, but there Is
some uncertainty In regard to three posl
tlons on the team. Due to the number of
experiments which were perforce neces
sary Chamberlain did not have as much
time to organize an eleven as did Coch
ran and Kelly aeroâ the bay. During
the season great shouts of distress have
come from Stanford, which would lead the
outside public to believe that the material
at Palo Alto was of the poorest. This is
not the fact. There is good timber In
Stanford's eleven of UN and if there Is
sufficient time to work It into shape, the
Cardinal will send an eleven to this city
on Thanksgiving day that will make Cali
fornia's much vaunted eleven work to the
utmost of their abilities, if they would
cat off the honors of the day.
Stanford Is noted for Its recuperative
power. Three years ago the team was
crippled and In dire physical distress two
weeks before the game. The men went to
the mountains on crutches. They came
back strong, organized and determined to
win. The score 20â0 read California a les
son. What this secret practice In a se
cluded place far from the curious will do
for Palo Alto this year remains to be
seen. At Del Monte the team will be
away from the college, and left to Itself.
Football will be drilled into those eleven
men morning, noon and evening until
they become saturnted. In a week it will
be attempted by the coaches to evolve a
team capable of concentrated action. J
The Stanford eleven, which was rolled
down the field last year to the tune of v
22â 0 score, was not in good physical con
dition. The malaria of Palo Alto was In
the blood Of the men and they were slug
gish, slow and bruised before the game
began. Nothing of this sort exists now.
Under the skillful hands of Trainer Mur
phy the Stanford men are in splendid con
dition. All the players are what might be
called in the pink of condition, with the
possible exception of Chester Murphy, the
quarterback and captain of the team. His
Injuries are slight, a fractured rib. or as
h" himself calls It, a "split slat." This is
th.' least of all Injuries to a football play
er. When padded and -':â¢â¢-â â¢ for action
he will be in good shape to withstand any
attack upon the broken bone.
California Is not so happy In the matter
of condition. During the week the men of
the big team have not played together a
single time. Being an organized team in
the beginning of the season the men con
ditioned rapidly. Cochran noticed recently
that his lightning backs. II ill and Smith,
and his fleet Womble couldn't get off their
feet. They had gone stale. Pringle was
playing like a man without spirit or In
terest, ami Whlpple was not In any too
good condition. So a rest was ordered for
these five men. They were sent out of
town, told to free their minds from .ill
football thoughtsâ ln fact, to Idle away
their time until they heard from the
coaches. They have heard now, and to
day the California team will line up In
Thanksgiving battle array for the last
real hard practice of the season.
This week's desultory and unsatisfac
tory practice of the California eleven Is
not militating to their chances In any
great degree. They have played as a team
now for two years, and with the excep
tion of quarter and left end no changes
have been made. But one thing Is certain
If the men are stale when they meet Stan
ford next Thursday a football surprise
will happen.
The Thanksgiving game promises to be
an open one. and on the part of Califor
nia free from trick p'aya. No secret prac
tice has been ordered at Berkeley, and
Cochran said yesterday that he wouM not
have any of it this season. "Nothing but
straight footbull will be resorted to. an<!
I think this will prove the better kind."
htanford has now locked Itself up In lJt-1
Monte, and th"! Is no telling Just what
n*w wrinkles will be seen when the car
dinal meets the blue and gold.
There are two thlnns which show tbo
popular estlmution of a team's worth,
partisanship and betting, both equally
false for a true rating of the relative mer
its of a team. California Is offering odd*
of --I on the result of thf game, wlthmt
any takers. Another favorite bet at ev*n
money Is that Stanford will be def-nted
by a majority of flfu-en points. This In
not warranted by conditions as they *>x:at
at present, although from a purely form
tnsls California should bÂ«Â» the choice in
both those wagers. The season's work of
both teams Is as follows: California playÂ»il
Olympics one tie gume am! defeated th i
Olympics twice, once Â«-0. the second 17-v.
Stanford played Olympics four times, two
tie games and being defeated twice, br
scores Â«-5 and 17-0. Stanford defeated tho
University of Nevada 17-o. California de
feated the same team 21-0. But one con
clusion can be drawn from this, and that
is California 1? the natural favorite. It
must be rememlw-red that when thrs<j
gnmes were played Stanford was evolving
from disorganization to organization, ami
that when the team lines up Thankrirlvlnic
day It may bo a developed eleven far dif
ferent from any that played during thu
season.
When the teams line up Stanford will
have the advantage In weight by about
forty pounds. In experience and natural
ability California's backs are far superior
to Stanford's. Captain Murphy will ofT
set .thing that the blue and fold can
produce a.Â« quarter. Such barfcs as Hall
Smith an. l kaarsberg cannot be found at
Palo Alto this year. The California !!n>
men are also more experienced than their
rivals, but It will take thÂ« jramo to provo
whether they are more skillful or not.
Now for the personnel of ihc team. Of
California nothing need be said except in
reference to quarterback and left end.
The candidate* for the end poÂ«itlon nrn
Hill nnd Masters, both T/rlirhlni: lOijj
pounds nnd without much choice betwerni
them. The former' â  defense Is a sharlu
better than that of Masters, nnd this wi'l
most likely earn him the position. In thÂ»Â»
case of quarter Rills will play the position
If the Joint meeting of the athletic com
mittees of both universities do not hnr
him. He is strong on the defensive, quirfc
and alert. .Hopper and Kerfoot ore thi
other aspirants, and It is nip and tuck i.c
tween them.
Stanford has but four veterans on th*
team. Burnett. Murphy. McFadden nr.fl
Parker. All the others are men of lim
ited experience, yet they give promise of
doing great things.
The table shows the tenms as they will
line up and the weights of the men.

DEL MON.TE. Nor. 21.-Nrver bcfnro
In the history of foot hn 11 at Stanford have
I seen such spirit among the players as
there Is In the squad at r>Â»| Monte. X
have been with every team since the prac
tice of sending the eleven Into retirement
for the- last week Of PÂ«Â«lce began In
ISS4. and I have had an amrle opportunity
to observe the spirit of the different
teams, bit I have never seen a crowd of
players mj thoroughly Imbued with the
luca that their one purpose In life was to
win 'the game against p.erkÂ»>>- on
Thanksgiving day. In the party that left
Btanfor i on the Monterey flyer there wero
twenty -six player*. Coach Chamberlain.

fumrJ in getting luncheon and settling In
their quarters in tho east wing of thy
!}Â°. . # At 3:3 l) tn * Â«Â»<iuad appeared on the
Held for practice.
After preliminary work of kicking and
catching the ball two elevens wÂ«Â»re plckerl
out and sent through signals. They lined
up for two fifteen minute halves. ThÂ«
first half was devoted to line bucking and
smashes on the tackle, the varsity keep*
lik the ball most of the time and gnln'.ni?
at will on the second. On the second halt
the play was most open, kicking being tho
order of the game. Rodolph, on the var
sity, had Just n shade the best of thin
kind of an argument over Roberta on tho
second. Raltt. on the varsity, did snma
fine work in th! ' half In running In points.
From my standpoint the practice was]
snappy and fast. The men were anxious
to work and went at It as if they liked It.

closed on h!s hand with a crunch. He
gave a yell and byhtanders rushed tO pull
the door open. Several guests of the bouse
who stood by when the hand was extri

it badly
the most that any of the Tale players will '
say is that tho men are fit. and that Yale
ought to win. The men were sent out
this evening for a stiff game of practice,
lining up against the substitutes, and they
scored three times in twelve minute* of
line work. This heavy practice on the
eve of a big game caused considerable
comment.
The Princeton team spent the night in
New York and will arrive In New Haven
to-morrow morning.
Game Scarce.
WOODLAND, Nov. 24.â For rrrnrn th<in
a month local sportsmen have been much
surprised at the unusual scarcity of game.
In several Instances hundreds of acres of
marsh land have been explored without
starting HO much as a single flock of
ducks. Thf Indications now are that the
conditions are Improving. This Is proba
bly dup to the weath*Â»r. There has been
FiiCh little Intermission between showors
that duoks have been driven Into the
ponds and shallow water for food. Several
hunters have been out this week and met
with fairly good success.

Successful Debut.

one of the fresh ar
riving stars of Jock

awajr his quickly
earned title of pub
<lc idol. Tommy had
the mount on Fuga
In the opening Brent
at Oakland yester
day, and the tip was too hot to be han
dled with the naked hands. The filly,
which by the way Is owned by J- H
Burk, was credited with a phenomenal
workout In the mud. and the play on
her began the night before In the hand
books. In which her price was hammered
from 10 down to 2. At the track she
wa* heavily plunged on at short odds.
Away well. Hums managed to get cut oft
and then steered Into the <le.-p going.
At the wire the good thing finished among
the "also rans," and the crowd frowned
on Tommy the balance of the afternoon.
Morgan landed Earl Islington. thÂ«
ond choice, winner by clever riding, three
lengths before The Offering.
The track was very' heavy in spots near
th>* turns?, as well ;ts next the rail, and
many a starter had Ml speed dolled by
trying to wallow through It. Nearly all
of the winnera wen returned by their
rMi rs taking the overland route. The
fields were large, occasioning several te
dious delays at the post. Favorites wen
but two j>urpes.
Maud Ferguson Ft.-irted In a race on
Monday last, and her showing on that
occasion was not a fflat-ringt t '-ring one, for she
finished last. Yesterday, In the second
event, pit t <-<l against a much ctu
band of platers, she reversed the order
of things. Tommy Hums got net away
In the lead, and at the wire won
easily from Yaruha. Espirando, equal
favorite with Torlbio, ran third. The win
ner was 5 ti> 1 In the ring.
The Hums \- Waterhouse filly Humid
ity narrowly averted defeat In tho sprint
which followed. Heavily backed at oven
money. It took all of Thorpe's knowl
edge of the tricks of tho art to land h<r
first, a neck in front of Bogus Hill. I'.ui
iel. another two-year-old start'-r. was
third.
Little Ranch made a bungling moss of
It on tho back of Sly, 4 to ;> favorite for
the fourth numhor on tho card. With or
ders, no doubt, not to make his run until
well Into tho stretch, ho almost waited
until tho Oakland town clock had toliod
tho hour of S, by which tlmo Whltcomh
had reached the wire. The winner was
well backed st odds of 7to 2. Show hon

Jtiflpos pending an Investigation as to the
; â¢ showing made by Flamaway.

Little Ranch was cautioned by the offi
cials in the stand to be more diligent In
future when riding a hot favorite like
Sly. It is all right to follow out Instruc
tions, perhaps, but a rider should use dis
cretion withal. If Ranch was told not to
make a move until a furlong from home
then the owner and trainer of the mare
should be reprimanded.
Vlttltoe created a most favorable Im
pression by his clever ride on Tiburon.
Me was one of the best boys riding on
the Western tracks, having many wins
to his credit. Some weeks ago he had a
bad fall at one of the- Chicago courses
which kept him out of the saddle for
some time.

A PHILIPPINE MYSTERY.
inquiry by Spain in Tehtion to the execu
tion of our agreement to release several thou
sand Spanish prisoners held by the Filipinos
raises a new Philippine mystery. According to the
reports from General Otis the Filipino army is dis
inicjrratcd. It surely has disappeared and was not
found in the cordon supposed to encircle it. Aguin
aldo is said to be a fugitive, and yet. somewhere in
his possession, restrained of their freedom, are several
thousand Spanish prisoners of war and a good many
American prisoners, including Lieutenant Gilmore
and his party. We arc unable to make the report of
the disintegration and flight of Aguinaldo's army and
the destruction of his power consistent with this state
of things. The situation being as reported, the Span
ish and American prisoners have only to ride into
the American lines, but they don't come. Of course
one day may change this situation and confirm the
hopes of Filipino failure and defeat which are now
cherished by all of our people. It is even said that
Aguinaldo has communicated to Agoncillo in Par:-;
his abandonment of further military resistance, and
that Agoncillo has made this public and is preparing
to return to Hongkong. Yet somewhere there must
be an organization sufficient to guard and hold thc^e
thousands of prisoners. That they are alive is proved
by Aguinaldo's offer to surrender them ii Spanish
ihips were sent to take them away. That plan was
interdicted by General Otis and so Spain abandoned
it and left her prisoners where they were.
The latest reports raise the presumption that some
of our recent military exertions have been directed
against non-combatants. The humorous report of the
capture of :hc town of O'Donncll recites that our
negro soldiers entered the place unresistcd at night
and, invading every native house, kicked the occu
pants into the street, amid ,the shrieking of the
women and children. These exploits are satisfactory
as demonstrations of our presence in the country,
but while they are going on where are the thousands
of Spanish prisoners and the force that must be guard
ing them, and where are â¢nore and the American
prisoner*?
THE SAMOfIN TREATY.
WHEN The Call exclusively published the com
plete text of the agreement reached by the
three powers at Apia we said it was an arrange
ment that would not long stand. That prophecy is
verified, for the agreement is already obsolcted and
England has withdrawn under an arrangement in
tended to bring Germany over to acquiescence in
British pretensions in South Africa. Having the
Caroline Islands and other cessions from Spain, Ger
many requires for her new naval and commercial
policy other insular possessions, and the United States
aids England by an agreement to partition Samoa be
tween this country and Germany. We already stand
.in the Ladroncs, b} the possession of Guam, and
now we agree to take an island in the Samoan group,
so that in both cases England puts us in her shoes
to face and watch Germany. It ii believed that the
treaty by which we take Samoan territory, made not
with the people of Samoa but with Great Britain and
Germany, is in preparation and will be reported to
the Senate for ratification. It will be a wide par
ture from all past policies. We acquired all of our
continental territory by treaty with the sovereignty
in possession or by direct consent of the people, as
in the case of Texas. In Samoa neither the United
States, nor Germany, nor England had sovereignty.
It is as if the Unite*! States, Portugal and England
*hould by treaty divide among them the United
States of Brazil, where neither had previous sov
ereignty. It is indeed a novelty in international
policy and one that in no way secures the future peace
of the world.

TIIE SAN FRAS I CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1890.
NO DISARMING.
THE Czar's proposition that the great nations
should beat their spears into pruning-hooks
and their swords into plowshares has gone
glimmering to the limbo of forgotten things, along
with other millennial plans that were intended to
usher in the Golden Age. If the Vnited States had
continued its policy of a small army and had ab
stained from the ambitions of conquest our example
of happiness and prosperity would have continued to
impress the world that great armies are not necessary
to the welfare of the people. The great strain upon
! the industry and resources of a nation involved in the
support of immense military establishments was tell
ing so seriously upon every European Government
that the fatherland sentiment of patriotism, appealed
: to to make the burden endurable, was yielding to the
feeling of the people that their share in the dynastic
glories reaped by war was insufficient to justify the
sacrifice of supporting armies. This popular feeling
hnd its strongest support in the example of the United
States. Tens of thousands of immigrants came an
nually from the military nations to this country,
where they seldom saw a soldier. Exuberant at their
release from military burdens, they inoculated senti
ment in every land they left by singing the praises of
the republic, which, by#frecdom from militarism, of
fered to all men the broadest and best opportunity
; for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This
example of ours was that enlightenment of the world
by liberty, represented by Bartholdi's statue in New
York harbor. It was the sole enlightenment, and it
means all that is precious to man. But now this light
is being quenched. Its flame burns weakly. We have
: entered upon what Jefferson called the hell of war
and ambition that was the curse of Europe. We have
gone as other military conquerors go, far abroad,
where we are necessarily involved in hostile contacts
with other conquerors, and have sought far away that
form of prestige which endangers us at home. As a
consequence there is a steady, persistent, unyielding
propaganda for the purpose of increasing our trained
military strength up to the measure of our new posi
tion and purpose. The arguments of this propaganda
are unanswerable. Granting its premise that we are
now the owners of nearly twenty millions of subjects,
indignant and hostile, ready to strike us any moment
when our attention is diverted, ready also to join any
enemy of ours who makes a demonstration against
our new pretensions, we must look forward to a stand
ing army of at least three hundred thousand men.
These will be needed not only to warn off foreign
aggression, but too soon for the purpose of repressing
those conditions at home which always develop in the
wake of militarism. War taxes are already upon us.
with the prospect of increase rather than decrease.
Labor is striking, in a blind way. at changes in our
system of Government, the very suggestion of which
implies a revolutionary spirit. Property is gradually
training itself to lean upon military rather than ju
dicial protection, and the signs circle our political
horizon that foretell our rapid transformation into a
military republic on a scale more vast and portentous
than the world has ever seen. True, there are among
us statesmen of experience and well-seasoned pa
triotism, like ex-President Harrison, who are dis
believers in the possibility of such a change in the
purpose of our people and the spirit of our Govern
ment, but the evidences are not wanting that they
conjure in vain.

A BRITISM CALICO TRUST.
Sic ago a movement was started in New
land to consolidate all the cotton mills oi
tion for the purpose of mure efficiently
meeting the competition that has sprung up in the
Sooth. The movement has not been heard of lately,
that fact it may be presumed to have failed
What could not be accomplished in New England
rs to have been achieved with comparatively
little difficulty in old England, for a recent number of
*c V\ . notes that the Calico Print -
D, Limited, has been registered in
lon with a capital of 6,000,000 pounds sterling
and 4,500.000 pounds in mortgage
debenture stocks. The Gazette bays: "It is another
combination on American lines, it being declared that
the company will have the monopoly of the whole
trade in this country."
ThÂ« trust movement in Great Britain
where s similar one failed to establish a monopoly in
even a section of the United States throws a good deal
tit Upon the much mooted question whether Amer
ican trusts are the creatures of the protective policy,
r our protective tariff the attempt to form a
prehenstve combination of the cotton mills of
New England failed, but under the free trade system
which prevails in Great Britain the combination was
ted and the monopoly established.
Il UvpreM ly that if free trade in calico
were permitted in the United States it would not be
long before the small factories would be driven out
of business, and then it would be as easy to consoli
date what were left in the country as it has been to
: such consolidation in Great Britain. Pro
tection, b) making the industry widely profitable, has
enabled SO many communities North and South to
undertake the manufacture of cotton that a combina
tion "f them is virtually impossible. Protection in
this instance, therefore, so far from promoting the
formation of a trust, has actually prevented the suc
cess of a movement undertaken for that purpose.
It is to be noted, moreover, that the Southern peo
ple, who have been the persistent and zealous oppo
nents of protection, are the direct beneficiaries of that
system in the case under consideration. With free
trade their small factories would be exposed to the
minous competition of mills operated under the trust

but to the South more, perhaps, than to any other,
lor the manufactures of that section are just begin
ning to grow into importance. The more intelligent
Southerners already perceive this, and are by no
means so clamorous for iree trade as they were a
comparatively short time ago. What will be the
elicci 01 the calico consolidation on the cotton indus
tries of Great Britain is not easy to foretell, but,
thanks to the Republican tariff, our cotton mills
South and North are fairly safe from any attack the
giant trust may make upon them.
The gamblers who were captured by the police in
the Mason-street den might reasonably plead in de
fense that they were not gambling. The evidence
in the Police Court is very clear that the patrons of
the place didn't have a chance on earth to win.
THE PANAMA CANAL fIGAIN.
/""* ONGRESSMAN HEPBURN of lowa, who as
I chairman of the House Committee on Inter-
state and Foreign Commerce had charge of the
Nicaragua canal bill in the last Congress, is reported
to have Stated recently that he would introduce a
canal biil in this Congress on the first day of the ses
sion and push it to action.
In making this statement Mr. Hepburn did not
overlook the opposition likely to come from the sup
porters of the Panama project. On the contrary, he
admitted that obstacles would be put in the way by
that company, since it is clear that if the Nicaragua
canal be constructed the Panama venture will col
lapse and all the money expended on it and invested
in it be lost. Nevertheless Mr. Hepburn stands firmly
in favor of the Nicaragua route and of prompt action
by our Government. He would have that action
taken, moreover, without reference to the claims of
the Maritime Canal Company, the Cragin-Eyre syn
dicate or other companies claiming concessions from
the Nicaraguan Government In fact, he said: "For
my own part I do not think the United States need
â  about any of these concessions. I have no
doubt that Costa Rica and Nicaragua will be glad to
give the United States any territory and any rights
it may need to prosecute and complete the canal."
Such statements, as a matter of course, aroused the
Panama people, and they have been prompt to make
reply. The New York Times, for example, after
quoting what Mr. Hepburn said about obtaining ter
ritory and rights from Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
said:
"So it appears that some work is to be done in the
field of diplomacy before any canal can be undertaken
by the United States. Meanwhile there is a eommis
lt work under the authority oi Congress inves
â¢ ng the whole (motion of an inter-oceanic canal,
with authority to expend a million dollars, if neces
and with instructions to take the Panama canal
into consideration. The Panama company has of
implete its canal within a specified time and
a controlling interest in it to the United State-,
after it is finished, without any risk to us. This offer
-of the ti. â¢ be repotted on by the investi
gating commission. Now would it not be well to wail
for this report before introducing and pushing a new
bill in Congress which is to involve so large an ex
penditure of money? The country is quite in earnest
about an isthmian canal and is rich enough to pay for
but the question of more or less pay, more or
abor, mo: tune in securing it. ought to
.pen until the commission make< its
report "
There is unquestionably much reason in the argu
ment stated by the Times, but it reopens the whole
and will have the effect of indefinitely postpon
ing the construction of the canal. Sooner or later
the route must be decided, and this wjnter is as good
a time as any to do it. It appears that our Govern
ment can get almost any concessions it desires from
either Nicaragua or Panama, and all that is needed
now is for Congress to determine what shall he done.
That question can just a^ well be decided this winter
â t winter. It is therefore gratifying to know that
Hepburn will introduce his bill ami push it vigor-
It the Panama people have any definite propo
sition to make let it be made without delay. The
people of the United States are not particular whether
the canal be at Panama or Nicaragua. All they ask
is that the waterway be provided and that it be under
the control of the Government of the United States,
undisturbed by foreign interference, but they wish ac
tion taken this winter.
GROWTH OF POSTAL BUSINESS.
POSTMASTER GENERAL SMITH in the
course of a recent address at Washington
made an interesting showing oi the marvelous
development and expansion which have taken place
in tlie business of the postoffice. In 1880 the depart
ment expended $.?6,000,000 and had a revenue of
$3.^.000,000. This year expenditures will he about
.00.000. and the revenues will be over $100,000,
000. In a period in which the population has in
creased 50 per cent the postal business has increased
300 per cent. The revenues are increasing faster than
the expenditures, so that in a short time it is expected
that the deficit will be wiped out. and this will be ac
complished in the face of the increase in the effi
ciency of the service.
So vast an expansion of postal business is a subject
of just pride to the people whose activities make it pos
sible and to the Government that has provided for it.
Nevertheless the expansion has not kept pace with
the popular demand. For years past there has been
an agitation for a postal savings bank system and for
a parcels post, and some of the ablest of our Post
masters General have endeavored to bring about their
establishment. Up to this time, however, all such
efforts have failed, and to that extent the expansion
of "ur postal facilities has been disappointing.
Fortunately there are good reasons for believing
the parcels post at least may soon be provided. Ar
rangements have been made for providing such postal
conveniences with foreign nations, and as a result
there has arisen a strong movement to have the same
facilities extended to the domestic postal service. In
a discussion of the subject at the recent Commercial
Congress in Philadelphia there was but one speaker
who opposed the plan. The sentiments of the mer
chants generally are in favor of it. and some of the
most potent of our commercial organizations are
j zealously working for it. It has been said that what
' ever the business interests of the country persistently
1 demand of the Government is sooner or later granted,
and it is therefore probable that when next the Post
master General has to describe the extension of our
( postal facilities he will include in the list the parcels
, post.
Another army officer in our midst has been
"drugged." and while in that interesting condition
made an inoffensive citizen a target for pistol prac
tice. One of these night* some reveling soldier may
discover that hot lead is a complete antidote for most
drugs.
The Chkagq Record is authority for the statement
that the price of leather in the United States and
Canada has taken a sudden jump. Well, it will only
cost some people more money to toe the mark.

Special Dlepatch to The CilL
WASHINGTON*. Nov. 24.-A split has
occurred in the organization of the Span
ish War Veterans, and a rival body was
formed to-day, to be known as the Span-
I ish-American War Veterans. Last week
the original organization held a protracted
meeting In this city and perfected its con
stitution and by-laws, and at that time
there were rumors of an impending split,
but nothing was made public officially of
It. To-day's â¢ ting was held in response
to an urgent call of Adjutant General
| LUler. who gives the following as the rea
son for the sp'.lt:
"General dissatisfaction, and an attempt
to place the organization In the hands of
Ohio representatives, making It appear as
a move for political purposes, and the re
cent action of the committee, which was
in the minority, assuming the privilege of
eliminating and vacating offices created
by the national convention, making sev
eral appointive officers, and n move to
control the association generally and re
move the headquarters to Ohio. Those
who were preseat to-day are men who have
made national reputations, and are here
to make the organization a success, und
not uso it for seliish motives."
The new organization makes all those
who served in the regular or voluraeer
army, navy or marine corps during the
Spanish-American war, and those now
serving in the present Philippine war. eli
gible to membership, provided they can
bhow on honorable discharge. A resolu
tion was adopted declaring it to be Lne
sense of the body that Admiral George
Dewey be "placed at its head, and author
izing the adjutant general to convey to
the admiral the information of his unani
mous selection as commander-ln-chief,
and that he be earnestly requested to ac
cept the office."
The names of those present at the meet-
Ing, and also the number present, are with
held by General LilN-r.

FORTY-NINTH TO BE HURRIED
Smallpox "Will Be the Controlling
factor In the Sending Away of
the Men From the
South,
The boast of the Secretary of War that
the last of the volunteers would eat their
Christmas dinners in the Philippines will
hardly be verified, for smallpox will have
something to say in the matter, and its
effects will delay at least one regiment,
the unfortunate Forty-elthth, until Jan
uary.
There was another case in the Forty
eighth yesterday, according to re
ports, and the laws of smallpox require
that quarantine, to be safe, must be two
weeks from the breaking out of the laÂ«t
This will make at least two weeks
more detention for the regiment, and If
other cases should show themselves the
time will be extended. Two weeks from
to-day, even if the re>dment should be re
leased at that time, would leave the com
mand (in the high seas on Christmas. But
the Secretary of War did not count on
smallpox when he made his boast.
The Forty-ninth Infantry wili probably
get ahe.i i of the Forty-eighth on account
of the quarantine regulations. The Forty
ninth was recruited where there was pre
sumably no smallpox, and ko it will not
lÂ»- delayed. It is scheduled to sail Mon
day next ->n the Warren, but no orders
to that effect have as yet been Issued
The 1-orty-nlnth has not had much drill
nor much target practice, but It Is the
evident Intention of the Government to
that up to General Otis, an.l lot him
order the later regiments to the firing line
or the drill ground, as he plsesiT None
of the second call r.-giments have been
â 1 tv the extent that would be ex
pected of men destined to meet the enemy
at once, but they have been sent on any
way. In the case of the Forty-ninth, if
it go on Monday, it will have been in ser
vice but a very few weeks, and it is not
too much to expect months of drill before
a regiment is fit for serious work in the
trenches or on the field. It Is expected
that the Potty-eighth will be delayed long
enough to nail on the Sherman, which is
due here within a week.
A general court-martial has been ap
pointed to meet at the camp of the Forty
ninth Infantry- The detail for the court

1% would be unsafe to ask Contractor
I. J. Ehea about the Macdonough lot
; which he has been excavating on Mason

took the contract to excavate the Ma
son-street lot last June, and since July
he has been digging and carting away
sand to fill up the salt marsh land of C
; P. Huntlngton et aI. at the foot of Fifth
street at so much a cubic yard. Whether
Shea wished to increase his exchequer out
of tho Pacific Improvement Company*
funds or to cart away the greater por
tion of Mason street, has not been ascer
tained, but he has succeeded in getting
away with about one-half of Mason
street, and If left alone will probably ret
, away with the other half of the street
More than half of the street has been
monopolized by Shea during the past
five months, to the discomfort of the trav
eling public. The work of total destruc
tion, however, has been temporarily In
terrupted by the bursting of one of the
Sp Ji in Â»ftf t. V s lie ? Water Company's mains,
which had been undermined by Shea's
workmen. The bursting of this main, to
gether with the late downpour of rain
has had the effect of flooding the Mac

THE TRANSFER ORDINANCE.
: H. Lorenzen Will Test Its Validity
in the Supreme Court.
The much-talkfd-of transfer case Is now
in the Supreme Court, and the merits of
local order Â£<O2 of the Board of Supervis
ors, which prohibits the iflvlng, accepting
or telling street car transfers except by
duly authorized agents and conductors of
the corporations Issuing the same
will be tested. A few days
ago Henry l^orenzen. a well-to-do
citizen of this city, alighted from a Powell
street car at Eddy street and thought
lessly handed to a newsboy a transfer en
titling him to continue his Journey out
Market street. He was arrested by an of
ficer In citizen's clothes and carted off to

THE GOVERNOR VISITS TOWN
GAGE STRONGLY
CRITICIZED BY
THE MINING MEN
His Last Appoint
ments Unpopular.
FAT OFFICES FOR FRIENDS
Two of the Executive's Los Angeles
Supporters Placed in Power and
Popular Candidates Were
Given the Overlook.
Governor Gage has again demonstrated
| his proficiency In the gentle art of making
enemies. He has displayed no small abil
ity along that line ever since he dropped
I Into office, but latterly he has quit creat
ing Individual political and personal foes
and gone to making them in bunches.
Mr. Gage's latest official vagary has set
talking every mining man on the mother
lode. There is a roar to be heard from
French Camp to the Cosumnes, and there
is a reverberating echo of it here In San
I Francisco In the numerous places where
local and sojourning mine owners arc
! wont to congregate.
The Governor's two latest appointments
; are at the bottom of the row. ThrÂ« .
i ago a wire from I-os Angeles announced
| that he had appointed Stephen Bowers
I State Examiner of Mines ar.d W. L.
Watts State Oil Lands Kxamlner. A bill
passed at the last Legislature empowered
htm to make such appointments, and ap-
p ropriated $20,'Â«Â« ito pay the cusi of subse
i gent Investigations. Tne measure was of
Interest to every mining operator ii the
State, and had as well th.ir unqualified
; approval. No mining legislation then ac
! complished created more comment, and
prominent miners have boon pulling wires
! and exerting Influences toward having the
blgpest men ann:iÂ« them .selected by the
executive to do the work. It was so lm-
J port ant a matter with them. In lac., that
at the recont mining convention in this
city numerous recommendations were
made regarding '1"' matter.
There weru cuinpeient mining men ga
lore In both the northern and Bouthern
mines who wÂ«-re recommended and who
would have been tsMtfaiM >ry to a ma
jority of those interested. Among the ap
proved names mentioned were Thomas
il"Ughton. Thomas M. Eiayden and Ren
jamin Purlow of Bl Dorado County; State
Senator Chapman of Nevada County, A.
If. McDonald of Tuolumne, J. J. Crawford
and a half docen Others who have en
viable reputations in the mining sections.
Of all these facts Oovernoi â 
informed, and the miners were confident
he would hand the places out to popular
candidates. When, two we< ks af,'", he left
for I. os Angeles th- ted under
stood that they might receive an an
nouncement any day. They got the an
nouncement all right enough, and that Is
where the "kick" is coming. Neither of
the two men named was known outside
the citrus city. Thoy have not been iden
tified with the largest mining Interests
and sections of the .State, and for all any
of thÂ» northern and central miners knew
had not practical knowledge of the busi
ness.
Those who are doing the talking felt
that the northern and central portions
should have been figured In when th<- ap
pointments were made, and were led to
believe that they would be.
The Governor, however, took a quiet
tri;> south and celebrated It by putting I
two more of bis southern friends and sup
porters Into fat ofnoes, to the exclusion
of the rights and privileges of th
sections of the State. Powers, made Kx
amtner of Mines, bears the title of i'h D.
and two or three other alphabetical at
tachments. He is well known In the south
as an excellent theoretical miner and bet
ter known as the editor of the Voice, the '
ofllcial organ of the Prohibition party.
He has been dose to the executive for
years and has published his numerous ex
planations when no other publication
could be found to hanilS- thorn. W. L,
Watts, the new Examiner of Oil Lands.
is said to have mastf -1 that science
within the last year or so, and although
not widely known Is reported to hi
tablished a considerable refutation within
his limited sphere.
The miners at this end of the line,
however, are not figuring on a matter of
ability but upon the question of sectional
rights and practical results. The dozen
and more who are at present In the city
are holding daily indignation meetings at
the Lick House, and the Governor Is com
ing in for the severest ensure that has
been his lot since the lato unpleasantness
in Sacramento.
THE BALLOTS WERE LEGAL.
Yuba Recorder Case Decided in Favor
of Fred Day.
The Supreme Court has upset tho decis
ion of the Superior Court of Yuba In the
contested election case of I>ay vs. Cun
ning. Fre<l EL l>:iy and S. v. Gunning
were candidates for the position of County
Auditor and Recorder. The board of can
vassers pave tho .â¢ortiflcatc of election to
Gunning and Day made a contest. Tho
Judge of the Superior Court decided that
Day was entitled to thr place by a major
ity of six votes. He had. thrown out thir
teen ballotÃ cast for Clmmlng upon the
ground that they were illegal, having
"Identification" marks thereon. These
marks consisted of more names being
marked with the usual X than there were
places to fill. These, it v. as contested,
were placed there so that the ballots
might be subsequently rf<-ognired and
known. The Supreme Court yesterday
reversed this Judgment, holding that these
should not have been reg.irdt-d as idtntiii
cation marks and wÂ»to of no Â« ffoct s.. Car
as these contestants wort- concerned, and
only applied to those opposite whose
names they were placed. In other words
the discarded ballots should be counted
for Gunning. This gives the latter the
position. ____ _______^ _

Plans to Run a Boat From Point

crops this year will be something as aa
j Mulshing as they will be gratifying.
"While tho rain has dont mucfl for the
I farmer it hns neatly delayed work on the

] the- teame mire down, making hauling an
i impossibility, while the wetness of every
thing practically stops all other work and
retards the progress nf construction.
These conditions make the entrance .if tho

â¢ that as far as he knew, and ho would cer

and there was no intention of building any
boat to connect the two points.
GAGE CREATES A
FLURRY AT THE
PALACE HOTEL
Lunches With Herold
and Budd.
â¦ â -
POLITICIANS ARE DISMAYED
â¦
The Governor Makes an Inspection of
the Water Front and Comments
in Eloquent SilencÂ« on
What He Saw.
The political army that camps In thÂ«
corridors of the Talace Hotel was In a
fever of excitement yesterday afternoon.
A most distinguished party was at lun
cheon, and the buzz of comment anJ
speculation passed from mouth to ear un
til even the bellboys were telling the story
In whispers. Governor Gage, ex-Governor
Budd. Harbor Commissioner Rudolph
Herold Jr. and Harbor Commissioner
Parts Kilburn were at luncheon at the
same table. What It all meant no one
was willing to say. Some thought that
Ilerold was host and was paying the dell
ribute of a meal to thÂ£ Governor
for tho gift of the berth at the water
front.
The fevered Imaginations of the on
lookers could pee the envy-tinted eyes of
Colonel Chadbourno glaring from the
â badow of a â creen. But it was all in
their mind. Tho doughty colonel did not
appear to see the triumph of hlfl rival and
the conference, which would have made
his Republican blnud boil. The party atÂ©
on unmindful of the Hurry it had en
Governor <;.tt:.> wai placidity personified;
Hep iM waa paying ii O r the lunch. After
an h-.ur spent as general disturbers of
thtÂ» peace of tho hotel tho quartet left
and went to the water front.
Then the mystery was rleared away.
<;.ik<- was simply on a t^ur of inspection
Â«if the water front, in company with
Budd, Harold und Kilburn he had tr:iv- '
eled alone ih<- wharves until the Journey
tired, and then, boarding th^ tu< Qov
ernor Markham, the party went down the
bay. When it returned Commissioner
H.-rold Invited the puny to lunch at tho '
I 'a lace.
Tin- Governor's visit was prompted by
nothing in particular and resulted In
nothing cVflnit* 1 . The Governor's com
ment on the Deeds ><( the water front wan
n â  . ll flashes of eloquent sl
und affairs will remain as they
were.
Absolutely nothing can be done In refer
on.-e to the <-xt*nsi'in of wharves, which
has lir>on so earnestly urg^d by nier-
Ohants and shippers. Thp length of the
wharves is regulated by law and cannot
bo changed without an amendment to the
lan- by legislative enactment. There la
p.Hid reason to believe that such an
amendment will be proposed by the next
Legislature.
Rescued a Prisoner.
Two roldlers assaulted Officer J. Ed
wards of the California street station at
Pine and Kearny streets last evening, in
an attempt to rescue a fellow soldier, whom
Edwards had arrested near Bacon alley.
Edwards was knocked down and badly
bruised, but ho finally succeeded In ar
resting both his assailants. Their names
are Harry Dillon and J.>nn Hayes. Dillon
had to be taken to the Receiving Hospital,
the result of the clubbing he received.
Both were charged with battery on an
i filcor.
An Excellent Combination.
1 The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Svnui- of Figs, manufactured by the
Califohnia Fio Syr.ur Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to bo
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habittial constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna end
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fio Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

REAL ESTATE VERY ACTIVE.
ONE miUlnn dollars In round num
bers Is the aggregate value of the
r<nl rstato which has changed
hands In San Francisco d%dng the
past two weeks, and this fact Is
ntnpla proof of thÂ«Â» stoady Improvement
In the local market which has boon going
Â«:i hSnce early ln the spring. During the
Â»-umrncr months. It Is true, thÂ© number of
transfers' it-corded wc-ro comparatively
few and the value of property that
changed hands was not Indicative of an
â¦ xccptlor.ally good year for tho brokers,
l)Ut when It 1b remembered that the sum
jr.cr month!", or tho vacation period, as U
Is call**d by the brokers, arc never figured
on to f well the Mat of transfers to any ap
preciable extent, the dullness bo notlce
uMo at that time Is not of much moment.
ltut If city property fclone were doing well
*?-:n Francisco might not have any great
r^.von for congratulation, us a i*ort of
uctivity could possibly be traced to special
conditions and influences of r more or less
tÂ«n^Â«Â»r.iry character. But It Is not city
jiroprrty alone that Is experiencing the
lienc-flt of prosperity. During the past few
ttv.r.ths there, has developed an enormous
demand for out-of-town property, trans
ifr% increasing fully 40 per rotit during
that period, und had it not been fcr the
txvo dry M-nsons with which the State has
lw<n afQlrted the influx of homwH-kor;
Sato California during the past year would
liave t>ccn unprv< edÂ« ntM. As San r ran
dseo tlertvÂ«-Â« Its i>n.f-pÂ»rlty from the state
*bÂ« activity In rural r.-ai estate furnishes

A Husky ExpresÃman Makes Things
Lively in the Beck Household.
Members of the Beck family of 2019 Clay
street are having troubles of their own.
The daughter of the house is soon to be
married to Will Fulton. Daughters have
preceded Miss Beck on the rose strewn
path of domestic bliss and daughters will,
without a doubt, follow her. No, there is
really no reason why the Becks should
fret themselves because their child and
sister i.s soon to become the bride- of Will
Fulton. It Is the incident connected with
the wedding preparations which occurred
yesterday that gives them Juet cause for
perturbation.
Among the articles needed in the Beck
household Is a large plate glu>* mirror.
To say that a mirror Is needed carries no
reflection. It Is wanted merely as an ad
junct to the general decoration of the
homo for the approaching festivities.
Yesterday Papa Beck, while downtown,
bought Just the right sort of a mirror and
sent It to his home In the charge of an
-â¢â¢man. The expressman started
with the mirror and arrived with not only
thÂ«Â» glass but a fair sited package of his
own as well. He was a large man, and
after depositing the glass in the parlor, he
seized a lamp and started to Inspect the
houso. There was no one at home, save
the women of the family and a young
man who was too email of stature and
too flaccid of musslo to count. The ex
pressman had things all his own way.
After looking the house thoroughly over
he decided that the most comfortable
place wai a large divan in the parlor, and
ignoring the protestations of the women
and the solitary man. he stretched him
self out at full length and went sound
asleep.
The patrolman on the beat was pent for
and came. He tried to eject the Intruder.
but it was no use. Th.- expressman made
no resistance. He merely continued to
sl'imber. but his bulk was too much for
one cop to carry off single handed. An
other cop was sent for. He came and be
tween them the two officers succeeded !n
awakening -the slumbering giant. Then
the trouble commenced. There was a bad
quarter of an hour and then the express
man and the two otllcers went down the
front steps ln a bunch.
Papa Beck now not only has to buy an
other mlm>r. but he will be obliged to re
furnish his parlor before the wedding
guests may be bidden to enter.

ENDURING STRENGTH
PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND
RpQtfIPPQ lasted Nerves: Sustains Vitality: Keeps the
nCStUI CO Body Free of Morbid Poisonous Matter: Helps
the System to Renew Strength.
Max F. Abbe, 25 Cortland st., New York City, writes:
"About two years ago I noticed that nervous symptoms had
commenced to trouble me. I decided to try Paine's Celery Com-
pound, and after using several bottles I noticed that the greater
part of my nervousness had disappeared, my thoughts had become
clearer, I did not pass any more sleepless nights, and I felt as
young as I did ten years ago, without having to stop my smoking."
Overwork, worry or business cares wear upon the nerves, the
vitality of the system is impaired; there is suffering from indigestion,
torpid liver or weak kidneys.
Paine's Celery Compound sustains vitality, keeps the body
healthy and free from nervous exhaustion and pain.

The end of the regular California
Ltague baseball season will be reached
to-morrow afternoon, when the Oakland*
and San Franciacos will play the. last of
their series. The Oaklands are hovering
between third place and the tall end, and
It would afford the Frlscoa considerable
satisfaction to put the dudes at the DOt
tom of the ladder. The season which Is
about to- close has been a successful one,
notwithstanding the failure of two of the
bix clubs with which it was Inaugurated
to stay until the llnlsh.
That the Mason does not end in a pyro
technic fashion is due to the fact that
the pennant has been won, but there has
been a wholesome rivalry between tne
teams.
It Is almost a settled fact that the ira

At Third and Mission streets they be

they met the officer.
The two mm had not stopped following

himself without leave, and would be fined

the girl.
The Judge said he would plve him the

thought a sentence of twenty-four hours
in prison would meet the case, as he had
already spent seventy-two hours there.

THIS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2"\ 1899.
FRAWLEY ARRIVES WITH
NEW PLAYS AND PLAYERS
T DANIEL FRAWT.KY. minus his mustache. Is In town. New raiment and
some new footllght talent came with himâ also a number of new plays
o packed safely away in the dozen or more trunks that hold his extensive
wardrobe, for Timothy Daniel is now the leading man of the company
which bears his own Individual trademark.
Frawley will open at the California Sunday night In the "Sporting Duchess,"
an Eastern success, which is risque enough to entwine the Interests of the San
Francisco public as It has th. theater-goers of th<- East. After that he will give
a batch of good plays, all of which have won the favor md commendation of
audiences and frigid critics.
The second play of the ' Wley company will be Jerome K. Jerome's "Coun
selor's Wife," to be produced here under the name of "Ben Dixon's Wife." Then
Seymour and Hick" "Flying Colors" will be produced, for which Mr. Frawley
has secured the entire Western rights.
This will be succeeded by "A Tale of Two Cities." a dramatization of Dickens'
stirring novel, with Its strong scenes of revolutionary turmoil. Pinero's "Prin
cess and Butterfly" and Belasco's "The Duke's Motto." revised and â¢ â¢ ached,
will find Interpretation by Frawley before his twelve weeks at the California'
are concluded. The New York success, "In Paradise." and "The Enemy to tho
King." "Chlmmle Fadden" and "The Bowers," a dramatization of Merriman's
novel of the same name, are also on the list.
Altogether. Frawley will be here three months. His leading lady Is Mary
Hampton, well known to this city. Mary Van Buren Is still with the company, aa
well as Phrosa McAllister and a number " others, who were in his ranks last
st-ason. Among the male strength Theodore Hamilton and Francis Byrne occupy
leading positions.
One of the features of the Frawley engagement will be the presentation of
several of Ibsen's popular dramas. While in New York Mr. Frawley met Charles
H. Meltxer, who is a representative as well as an exponent of the higher literary
and dramatic taste of that city, and the two will work In harmony to secure a
successful production of Ibsen and other modern playwrights of great literary
ability. The "Wild Duck" will be put on. also the "Doll's House" and other
plays. These will be given as matinee performances, Mr. Frawley being of the
thata t - Itisen drawn morayommi-ihan-nKH). â
In regard to the theatrical outlook for San Francisco Mr. Frawley said last
night:
"There are hardly enough first class productions to fill the theaters of thÂ«
syndicate In the East. For that reason but few of th- all) good show- win
come out this year, and it may be some time before we see any of the . ,_ sue
cesses. Next year I shall have something big for San Franciscoâ Mra Minni."

This will be something worth the seeing and is sure to take San Francisco by
the ears."
After his local engagement Mr. Frawley will do the Northwest.

Elmer Rives Dies of
Tuberculosis.
Bpeclal I'Ui'atch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 24.â A death occurred
at out yesterday afternoon which Is
destined to attract Wide attention from
the medical profession. The case also
presents important facts for the general
public. The death was that of Elmer
Rives, a man 29 years of age. Another
man. Hurt Haley, is at the point of death
at Gilroy with the same disease, tubercu
losis.
uplo of years ago the two men. aa
hale and hearty M any in the valley, were
engaged to kill and dissect cattle affect

from the affecteU cattle spread to the two

HE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS
The Other Two Defendants Enter a

MUST VACATE AFTER
A TENANCY OF YEARS
ATTORNEY SPLIVALO DEFEAT
ED IN A LEGAL BATTLE.
He Wrote a Letter to the Management
of the Montgomery Block Pro-
testing, but It Did No
Good.
Two men, their silver hair telling of
their scores of years of life, and a gray
haired lawyer, the defendant In an evic
tion suit, called old times to mind In
Judge Hunt'a court yesterday. A quar
ter of a century ago August D. Spllvalo
took rooms In the Montgomery block, but
lately be has not paid his rent, and B.
Ratto, a director of the Montgomery
Block Real Estate Associates, whose hair
has whitened beneath the roof of this
once splendid building, sued him to re
cover possession and four months' rent.
The suit was tried yesterday, and after
a vain light BpUvalo consented that Judg
ment be entered against him, and Bald
he would vacate December 1.
The case of the plaintiff was laid before
the court in the face of a volley of ob
jections, and among the exhibits was a
letter written by Bplivalo, a little tan
gled, but still making plain the fact that
he objected to his treatment at the hands
of the Mock managers. The letter reads:
I am fiiri>rl!*.-.i at your demand of two
months' rent for Antrim and September. You
know that during this time the tinkering- ami
nolle and blocking of stairs sad hulls and In
vanÂ»on â â¢â¢â¢â ' rooms have rendered you
liable for damages to me. You are not acting
in good faith nor fairly by me. 1 have been
your tenant for many years and all you have
expended on the rooms occupied by me during
that time liÂ« about SI to replace a bad lock of
your* burst by a burglar at my coat of HO for
an overcoat stolen, and without water or gas.
Notwithstanding these facts as set
forth In the letter, the law was against
th< ae,.d lawy.-r. and after a quart' r of a
century of ceaseless rent paying he must
vacate to another with more ready
money.

VI. FAMILY RELATIONS AND
DOMESTIC LIFE.
There la no phase vt the art of .Ivlng
so difficult tc master m that of abiding
with one's family. Always '.o be g' od
tempered it- almost Impossible. Par*nts
can be Just as aggravating as children,
and the elder the boys and girls are the
harder often Is It for theia to get on
with their fathers and mothers. There
fore so many ladies' apartment! and â â¢â¢â â â¢
cdlet chambers, for th*. question of wom
an suffrage, with all Its virtues and falla
cies. Is far less vexatious than thÂ» set
tlement of rights and duties In domestic
life, since no amount of suffrage will ever
enable a daughter to be freed from filial
obligation, and manhood suffrage does
not remit a father"! legal obligation to
support his children.
The modern grown-up girl declan
has Â» life s1 her own to fulfil] and that
as it I- deemed ill r|ghl to leai
home through marriage it is ,
orable to forsake it In a pi i ;ii or
business career. Whose f;>nit la I!
sh.' so reasons? The parents*, who v m
nol accommodate Urn to modern
demands, say th<Â» daughter. The . litl
dren's, who forget gratitude nnd >i â¢
in their desire f<>r lndep< vf * n *'
parents*. Consequently there i* in most
homes perpetual friction over Individual
right* whl<h even the presence of OMV
panjr â¢ .
Secretly i think parents are far more
to blame than their children. They had
rather ke?p their ways, be old-fashioned,
have the dinner served as they like and
maintain punctuality, decorum, with all
the other middle class virtues, than prac
tice the liitjher graces of adopting mod
ern devices of having; no set time for
any meal, but of always keeping things
hot: of free-and-easy manners, and of
spending instead of saving. It Is mighty
hard to be an agreeable parent nowaduys,
but one should not begin as a parent un
less willing to renounce one ways as
children grow up.
All depends upon the point of view. If
on*> owes surety to the world I
tlnuance, it the bUsslnga of Immortal life
should not be restricted, then any kind
of parent is â  phllanthropM But if a
child iiv.ts that, never having :
if he were willing to fulfill in himself the
destiny of the world, be Is it liberty to
do so m be chooses, then tho on!-.
of living peaceably i.~ by the ezee
mutual chivalry, a far more gradoui ob
servance than that Â«>f mere forbeai
Even th.' arammar school punt] of i
kÂ» wa that the authority of th
over th* woman ami of th" i

science has relegated birth to the c.it*>

dence and Impudence of our little Mi

twithstandlng all this. n mother'a
bappi< rt I â  are those when her ehil-
<lren are yminsrwhTO the home nursery
Is the kindergarten and she Is the teacher
playmate and guardian. If she likes she
can make herself miserable by Invoking
psychology to her aid, by tabulating her
discoveries in child lore and by pondering
upon the duties of a twentieth-century
mother. Better Is it to be her own nurs
erymaid and to have a good time with
her children, never letting them cry them
selves to sleep or feel too â¢ DUng an undue
weight of moral responsibility, and often
leaving them to Invent their own amuse
ments. So much Insistence baa been
placed upon the order of games and stud
ies that we have forgotten nature's right
to Individual caprices. The necessity of
letting boys and girls learn to make their
own choices is a hard lesson alike for
them and their parents to acquire. "Why
don't you tell me Just what to do Instead
of giving m.- the hard work of deciding?"
asked a daughter of her mother. When
the girl was 25 she knew why
Familiarity and frankness are essentials
In home life. It Is as much a pity when
either parent or child has Its most Inti
mate friend outside the home as It Is
when the guests of one are not the guests
of all In the house. Children enjoy the
distinction (if being consulted, and par
ents soon learn that It Is for their advan
tage to see things from the latest point of
view: that being called "the governor" or
"daddy" Is not disrespectful, and that it
Is happier to Joke a bit with the mother
than to regard her as simply a maid of
all-work or too old to be good for much.
Parents should never be old. and never
would be If children did not make them
SO,
But In order that our children may be
free, we, as parents, are very apt to lose
r.ur self-respect and allow ourselves to
be Imposed upon. We permit short an
swers, gruff ways, neglect of Httl M cour
tesies, and then complain about the man
ners of the present day. If a mother ha*
not taught her boy to pay good-morning
to her when he Is young he will be very
pure to let her do her own errands whin
he Is a man.
Moreover, there are parents who are so
self-abasing and short-sighted that they
consent to live with their married chil
flr. n instead of having the children live
with them. It makes a great dead of dif
ference whose house It Is. Tenderness
and strength are the genii that guide
frankness and familiarity until rectnes for
dally home living se.-m as antlo.ua
the old-fashioned way of learning to read
or of corresponding according to a "Com
pletfl Letter Writer."
A large amount of family friction Is
caused by the mistaken eonaclestttOUSfMSS]
of those parents who defraud th# t r
and girls of happiness by not telling them
they are prer '-looking; < every
on.- can be the latter* or wellHMUÃMred
and attractive. Many a child is lonely
even in fond homes where therÂ»- is little
outward expression of love and n
compliment. Even if pnJSa has Its bane
ful side. It Is a great deal happier to b.
setf-COOOatted because of It than gloomy
from want of It. Children all
make love to their parentn. telling them
how delightful they are, that middle life
and old age has given them a n- w kind
of charm. Many a mother grows set In
her ways and chary of pretty dressing
Just because her children do rv>t s.-em to
care about her clothes, and many a father
slides into slovenly tricks at table, or
smokes in disagreeable faÂ«Moa b
his children do not proudly keep him up
to the mark of always being a gentleman
with his family.
When not only on*"* own children are
so different from those of other folks, but
there Is merely a slight mental resem
blance amojig member* of the same fam
ily, this need of mutual chivalry is all
the, more Imperative | n understanding
each other. Fortunately. In spite of ,\\ m .
â imllarttles. the relation of brothers, and
sisters can be mot always Ist that of the
merriest, freest companionship, without
the perils and responsibilities of Ma Iliad
life being Involved thereby. It is a < o - m
fort not to be accountable for a friend
ship: brothers and sisters Just have to
accept each other. Ala*, the Ideal rela
tion Is not always fulfilled, owing to the
boys' Innate bosslsm and to the girls' ac
quired selfishness. But again Is It half
the Darenta' fault that there Is so much
turmoil bet Wees them. A mother tÂ»>icrieÂ«

many fishing hamlets In Its wide path. In

Bradstrcct's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Nov. 21.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Although specu
lation continues to be largely professional In
It 3 origin and quality the market for the
past week was generally strong. Money has
been fairly easy and the fact that no larg*.
Mocks of government bonds have been turned
Into the treasury in pursuance of Secretary
Gage's recent offer to purchase $25,000,000 of
bonds does not seem to produce any unfavor
able effect. It was noted, however, that on
W'ednefiday. when the call loan rate ran up
temporarily to 12 per cent, the stock market
experienced an Immediate chill and prices gen
erally fell without much selling pressure.
There has been considerable manipulation In
various parts of the share list. Most of It
was on the bull side and the operations of the
bear faction were confined to a few stocks
like Manhattan. It must be admitted, how
ever, that on the advances there was a dlÂ«
porltlon shown In many quarters to realize,
and except In a J few Instances the Improve
ments were not 'of a very positive nature.
London took some part In the week's proceed
ings and was a purchaser of Its specialties to
a moderate extent. The absence of any favor
able development In the South African war
ha*, however, a tendency to weaken the con
fidence of the London market. The renewed
decline of exchange rates here Is also a factor
of Importance abroad and caused a hardening
of the lyindon money market, there being ru
mor* that the Bank of England rate wnut-1
be advanced early next Week. The foreign
situation, however, had little Influence on the
sentiment of our own market. Speculation was
mainly concerned with money, and. having no
reasonable assurance that no stringency will
occur. Is Inclined to pay attention to the pos
slhillty of financial legislation at the next
session of Congress. The Idea that the Presi
dent's message will give prominence to cur
rency matters Is circulated and meets with
favor In financial circles. Favorable rnllr
earnings ar .1 reports of deals nnd combinations
have, however, been responsible for most of
the movements In railroad shares this week
The particular features In this connection 'ver*
the low-prlc<Â»d division of the Vanderbllt-
Morgan group of storks, with Chesapeake and
Ohio and "III* Four" as the particular ob
jects of attention. Some activity was shown
In Sugar. Leather and other Industrials, but
the enslng of money has not been as yet at
tended by any Increase of favor on the part
of the lenders toward the new Industrials ml
the Intter are consequently, aa a rule. Irregular
and Inactive.
Ti>e average of prices Is somewhat lower than
at the close of last Saturday notwithstanding
sharp advances In n number of Individual
stocks which are usually not prominent in the
market. I^ost week's glowing anticipations of
an abundance of money at cheap rates have not
beer, realized, and the disappointment In specu
lative circles has led to some marketing of
holdlnrs. There was a narrow demand to ab
sorb these holdings. The effects of the Gov
ernment bond redemptions on the stock market
have nearly equaled the hopes of hull specu
lators. The volume -of bonds offered at first
In response to the Treasury Department's offer
encouraged the expectation of a marked effect
on the money market. T?-it there were larre
holders of stocks who took advantnc* of th"
strength Induced hv the bond redemptions and
the pood Mnk statement of last Saturday to
sell out. This kind of selling on Monday and
a fiurrv In call mÂ«nev on Tuesday to 14 per
cent effectually dashed the hopes of n rampant
bull speculation Â«nd csutlous methods .one*
more came Into play. The .mull effect pro
duced on the open market for call loans by
disbursement of over $12.000.ft00 for government
bond redemotlons Is explained by the char-
actor of the holdings that have been redeemed.
A larg* proportion of these has come from
savings bunks. The large absorption during
the week of the United States 4 per cents
of 1925 shows that a considerable proportion ot
MM redeemed bonds were simply converted Into
the new 4s. with the purpose of extending the
period of the investment Such' an operation
brought no loanable funds into the market al
all. Besides the conversion Into the United
States new 4h the New York savings banks
used part of the redemption money to acquire
some of the New York municipal bonds which
were issued this week The New York City
government keeps Us cash In depository banks,
so that portion of the government redemption
money has become available to the market.
It thus happens that while the sub-treasury
operations have yielded upward of seven mil
lions during the week and cenfldence has been
felt that the technical condition of the banks
would be greatly Improved in Saturday's re
turns the^lncreased available resources of the
money market were not abundant. Last weeks
rumors of heavy holdings of Government bonds
which would be offered for redemption in
blocks and the proceeds used to lubricate the
wheels of speculation have been dissipated.
The course of the currency movement has been
obscure and uncertain The upward tendency
of New York exchange at Interior points early
In the week has given place to renewed heavi
ness, Indicating pretty clearly that the Interest
or demand la not yet satisfied. Such In
creased movement of money toward New York
as has taken place does not represent Idle
money seeking the low rate of Interest allowed
on deports. It H in settlement of the mercan
tile accounts due to the New York wholesale
merchants on purchases made during the sum
mer on four months' time and which, like all
other lines of business were unusually large
this year. The foreign exchange rate, which
suddenly bounded upward on the announce
ment of the government bond redemption offer,
has sagged during the week as the failure
of the money market to soften was manifest
and hail fallen by Thursday to $4 Ss'i for
sight bills, or within >;e of last week's low
point. But the Increased tension of the Lon
don market, which has lifted the private dis
count rate to a parity with the bank rate,
has lowered the exchange level at which gold
Imports would be profitable and by Friday In
duced a hardening in the sterling rate. Thus
the outlook at all points Is for continued stiff
ness of money owing to the Industrial and
commercial expansion and Wall street circles
are not inclined to resign themselves to the
conviction that no reflux of Idle funds to New
York banks Is likely in the immediate future.
Meantime the prosperity of all lines of busi
ness â nd especially of the railroads keep the
stock. market firm. There has been some specu
lation ln low-grade bonds and subsequent
profit-taking. Middle-grade bonds have been
in good demand. United States new 4s ad
vanced %, the 2s 4. the 3s Â«i and the old 4s
and It >i In the bid price.
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24â Pradstreefs to-mor
row will say: A striking Illustration of the un
derlying strength of the general business sit
uation Is furnished this week by the course of
prices. Almost without exception values of
staples rt-maln firm at previous quotations or
manifest a still further pp'rvuinced tendency
toward a higher level. Thlx. t.o. haa occurred
In the face of a rather snia'.ler distribution In
the ordinary trude i-hannelb than has been noted
ln recent weeks. So far as autumn and wlntei
trade is concerned the complaint of unreason
ably mild weather restricting retail distribution
la reported from man> clti.s. but rising superior
to this ami to the unque.-tionalily smaller dis
tribution at first hand Is the accentuated
BtrtMiL'th of textiles, but particularly â 
t; - Aa, which n-flect some adJltiunal strength
of the raw product due to smaller receipts and
better foreign aiivtces, but In a larger meas
ure also portray the lntiuen.-e of active de
mands coming on a market excejptlonally bare
of stocks, a further advance In prim
a. ft-uture of this week, has brought the quota
tion f..r stundard grades up to 3 centn. a point
not touclieii for f..ur years past. Haw wtx.l is
higher on the week at all markets on active
demand, shared In by the manufactured ma
terial, for whicli a good fall demand lias been
experienced and In which further price ad
vances are expected. The American market
: : wool Is still claimed to be the cheai-et.l
ln the world. The dullness In heavy winter
goods produced by the pres-nt warm weather
haa not as yet served to impair confidence m
wholesale lines.
Cereals remain on the whole dull and unin
teresting, and price fluctuations are within an
â¢nally narrow range, w.tli quotations
ruling about what they were one year ago.
Cupper is strong on a perceptibly Improved
demand, chiefly in electrical iinÂ«-s. Coffee hut

Dun's Rcz'icrv of Trade.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24.â R. O. Dun A Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
Monetary anxieties have faded with pales of
bonds to the Treasury Department under the.
recent offer, the fall In sterling exchange In
spite of the dearer money abroad and easier
here and the receipt of about $750,000 net from
the interior during the week. There Is no
trouble in the commercial money market and
there has been none and loans on securities
have ruled at easier rates. While the extraor
dinary volume of business throughout the
country requires greater activity of currency
1 than In ordinary times there Is no Indication
that the. volume has not been ample all the
year and the course of money markets through
out the Interior shows that the embarrassment
here has been due to operations outside of the
Industries and general trade.
The Iron Industry shows no yielding In ma
terial, but a little advance In Bessemer pig
at Plttsburg with large Inquiries for next
year. Prices of rails are maintained, with one
contract reported of 20.000 tons for Japan and
another pending for South Africa. A single
order for car axles covers 33.000. or 8500 tons.
Structural prices do not yield and angles are
quoted higher. But works which have nearly
or quite tilled their orders are seeking others
with concessions of $2 per ton In eastern plates,
11 In steel hoops and sheets and In bars at
Plttsburg. while cut nails are quoted U lower.
The general ratio of prices ior all finished pro
ducts Is now 2.34 per cent lower than Novem
ber 1. though the average for pig Iron Is 1
per cent higher. Copper Is unchanged. Tin
has been depressed to $27 50 by London specu
lation. Lead Is unchanged. Spelter Is lower
with rates nt $4 40, and aluminum Is higher
at 33 cents for ton lots. Heavy orders In the
past are reflected by shipments of boots and
shoes amounting to 281.272 cases In three weeks:
10.6 per cent more than In 1537 and 32.0 per
cent more than In 1594. with other years still
smaller. New business Is checked by continu
ing rise In prices, which have reached In some
grades 20 per cent per pair, with one large
contract In grain Creole at 22^4 per pair ad
vance.
Kales of wool pass all records, having been
at the three chief markets 61.694.203 pounds In
three weeks of November, whereas October
sales In five weeks were but â .SIMM pounds,
and In only on- other full month have sales
ever reached sixty million pounds. The trading
Is largely between dealer* and leaves no In
dication of consumption. The demand for
goods continues so large as to encourage much
buying by mills In spite of the advancing
prices.
Wheat worried speculators with scarcely any
change In prices for the week. Though West
ern receipts are .'.O per cent below last year's
lor the week and have been In three weeks
but 1fi.. .<".-. .<>::, bushels, against 15.544.1tJ lout war.
the decrease In exports HI heavy. From Atlantic
ports the outgo for three weeks, flour Included

I rtt.U3 last y.ur. Pacific port exports for tho
tlllv * * ook * hay Â« b^ n 2.71?.4;7 bushels., against
I 8.3.6.9 M last year. The slender foreign demand
In Atlantic markets with prices as low as they
ha\" been tends rtrongly to prevent a rise In
prices and the exports of corn also have sonic
influence, amounting for the "three weeks to
U T*Â»,Â«4] bueh-U. aiainst 7.7.'?. 0r* last year.
In spite of thÂ» gieat decrease In cot* -in and
wheat, experts of merchandise from New York

There will be no session of the Produce Ex
change to-day. In respect to the memory of the
late Vice President, and the Chicago and New

Chicago was weak at a decline, caused by
large selling by commission houses and free
realizing In December. The market was wholly
without support. No recovery Is expected
until the liquidation Is finished. The visible
supply Is expected to show an Increase of 1.000.

LITTLE JOKER
WAS INSERTED
IN THE OPTION
CuveTier Says No De
lay Is Possible.
Oakland Office Sr.n Francisco Call.
lÂ«0s Broadway; Nov. n.
Councilman Cuvellier does not fear any
delay in the testing of Roberts' wells be
cause the option has been extended to
August. 1900. The option contains clauses
that make an early test Imperative.
"From the published opinions,'; s;>M Mr.
Cuvellier to-day, "it is made to appear
that there Is no haste about tho testing
of the wells, because the city of Oakland
hau an option on the property until No
vember of next year. This is a mistake.
The conditions of the last extension grant
ed by Captain Roberts are ns follows:
"The wells mist be tested and the or
dinance be pass.Â»d within ninety days
after the i;th of November of this yetr.
to the effect that the city of Oakland has
decided that the Roberts property is
wanted by the city as a source of "mu
nicipal water supply, providing, of course.
that the wells .shall have stood the test
satisfactorily and given Indication of the
presence of water in unple abundance to
Justify the city In submitting a bond prop
osition to the people of Oakland for th.
purchase of the property and the estab
lishing of a municipal water plant.
"If the t^st Is maile and a conclusion to
purchase arrived Â«t within ninety days
after the 17ih of November of this year,
which brings us up to February 17." l!*> 0.
thrn by that fact the njitlon Is extended
for an additional s'.x months, which takes
v* to August 17. IW. But If within ninety
days after ;h<> 17th of November of thin
rear the wells shall not have been tested
by the city and a conclusion to purchase
shall not have ber>n arrived at. then the
option lapses February 17. 1900. and the
city of Oakland can look elsewhere for a
source of water supply.
"The first option socured from Captain
Roberts was for ninety duvs, beginning
In August of this year." With the sundry
extensions the option has conditionally
been prolonged to August of Ufa, There
is. however, no time to waste in comply
ing with these conditions."

THEY WON LAURELS
UNDER TWO FLAGS
OAKLAND. Nov. 24.â Private Albert Lloyd and D. C. Hynes, two soldiers
of the First Montana Reslmont, are to be tendered a big reception to
morrow evening at the local headquarters of the Salvation Army.
During .'he war In the Philippines these two men attained much dis
tinction and their conduct was very favorably reported upon by the
officers. They were regarded somewhat as noted characters because
they were the only two Salvationists In the regiment and they earned much
respect while fighting under their country'! flag by not sacrificing any of the
principles represented by the colors of the Salvation Army.
Major Millsaps of the army was one of the first chaplains when the war
broke out to obtain â  commission from President McKlnley to go with the
army to the Philippines. He ha.Â« been there since shortly after Dewey's vic
tory and In his correspondence to the War Cry has sent home many remark
able stories and among thÂ«-m are frequent references to the Interesting ex
periences of Privates Lloyd and Hynes. The reception to-morrow evening will
take the form of a iptlcon lecture and the proceeds are for the benefit
of the Rescue Home and the Orphan Children's Home.
FIGHT FOR LIFE
BETWEEN ROWE
AND THE MAYOR
Mask Thrown Aside.
The Issue Plain.
Â»
<â  kland < iffW Pan Francisco fall,
Iway, Nov. M.
The declaration of President Howe that
ho will be personally responsible for
bringing a suit against Mayor Snow has
opened wide the political squabble at the
City Hall. it Is no longer the city of
Oakland, through its counsel, that is
bringing a friendly suit against on ex-
Auditor; It Is Howe vs. Snow.
Now that the mask has been thrown
aside and tne .^entimentulism of the situa
tion has been exploded, there will hence
forth be open war in the Council and
every importunt vote will doubtless show
the line of division. Considerable talk is
being made over the action of the Prosl
dent of the Council In bringing suit after
the Council had formally disposed of It by
vote for ihreo months. His action la of
course a direct affront to the six gentle
men who voted to la) the matter over lost
Monday night. The Mayor having a ma
jority of the Council with him and like
wise a majority of the Board of Works,
can make things very warm for the men
who are determined to light him to a
flnlsh.
All the old wounds have been reopened,
and it is recalled that a few months aÂ«o
Mayor Brow made â  very significant re
mark. "If these people want to fight." he
said, "they may lind thnt 1 am also able
to do a little skirmishing." This remark
was made at a time when the controversy
over Street Superintendent Miller was at
its greatest heat. The "these people" re
ferred to by the Mayor were of course the
men who <;iu.-Â» ii It to be known that they
were behind Millerâ the faction headed by
Dr. Pardee.
Howe Im an avowed candidate for Super
visor and has a good hold on his district,
which is also â  Snow stronghold, and his
present attitude Is causing much com
ment. It Ii said that one of those little
dinners that were so common when this
Council first took office figures in the feel
ing between Snow and Rowe. ThÂ« Coun
cilman, so the story goes, invited th*
Mayor with the other Councilmen to his
festive board. At a late hour Mr. Snow
discovered he could not be present
The Mayor remembered the typewritten
list of appointments that were presented
to him for ratification at the Felton-Tay
lor dinner, has frequently referred to
them as political "Jam" parties and added
that he refuses to be "jammed."
The Snow-Howe quarrel is now the most
Interesting subject before the city gov
ernment. The bond Issue is completely
overshadowed.

IMPROVERS IN
FAVOR OF THE
SIMPSON TRACT
Fruitvale Replies to
Oakland Offlre Son PrandsCO fall.
Broadway, Nov. 24
The Twenty- third-avenue Improvement
Association has prepared a lengthy an
swer to th-> arguments of the Teirgraph
avenue and North Oakland Improvement
Association regarding public parks. The
latter clubs are anxious for the city to
purchase Rockrldge tract as a public
park, while the Twenty-third nvenue peo
ple desire the purchase of the Simpson
tract. At a public meeting Dr. S. K. Fos
ter of the Twenty-third avenue Associa
tion, having obtained data from the City
Attorney, laid before his club an answer
to the arguments of the North Oakland
people.
In his answer Dr. Foster nays that a
park for Oakland must be located above
the frost line and that the RoekrMge tract
does not fulilll this condition. The answer
I Includes the following:
"The Simpson trad is situated In the
warm fruit b<-lt and la all above the frost
line, and the climatic conditions are ho
much In its favor that it would be useless
; to Institute a comparison between the
two. There is no place purchasable for a
park within twenty miles of Oakland that
presents such a variety of scenery or thai
can equal the Simpson tract for distant
views and views which please thÂ«- â¢ I -.
From one point can lÂ« seen on a clear day
the Farallon Islands and the distant i'u
clttc Ocean on the right, and In front the
â¢ ;..;.ii -n Qate, Ban Jose, Ban Francisco,
Oakland and AlamfHla. and on the e.t
treme left Niles. Mount Diablo and Con
tra Costa County.
"There la another desideratum which
seems to have escaped Professor Lom
mon'a memory altogteherâ that of means
of Irrigating a park, which Is a source of
Immense e\p..ii>.- continually unless the
land furnishes sufficient running water
high enough for Irrigation purposes.
"The Simpson tract has running water
all over v sufficient for park purposes,
and In addition to this there are two Wtd*
ravines sloping out toward the summit,
where reservoirs can be constructed thai
will hold an Immense quantity of water

11 Dear Mrs. Pi.nkham â I think it is
my duty to write to you expressing
my sincere gratitude for the wonder-
ful relief I have experienced by the use
of Lydia E. IMnkham s Vegetable Com-
pound. I tried different doctors, nls<
different kinds of medicine. I woul.
feel better at times, then would 1.
as bad as ever.
" For eight years I was a great Ruf
ferer. I had falling of the womb am
was in such misery at my monthl;
periods 1 could not work but a litt
before I would have to lie down. Your
medicine has made a new woman of nit .
I can now work all day and not gat
tired. I thank you for what you have
done for me. I shall always praise
your medicine to all suffering women."
âMrs. E. E. KufITJT, Germing, Ohio.
" I have taken eight bottles of Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
and used two packages of your Sana-
tive Wash, also some of the Liver Pills
and 1 can say that your remedies will
do all that you claim for them. Heforc
taking your remedies] I was very bit
with womb trouble, was nervous, ha
no ambition, could not sleep, and my
food seemed to do mo no good. Now I
am well, and your medicine has cured
me. I will gladly recommend your med-
icine to every one wherever 1 go." â

sljrned the autopsy certificate as quoted In
this article. Dr. Zabala baa made the ex
l<!anatl<in that he signed tho certificate at
the request of Cormier Hill, upon the
strength of the testimony â¢â¢: Dr. O'Con
nor. Hut it is a singular fact that Dr.
O'Connor gave dilatation of the heart and
dnipsy as the cause of death, while Dr.
/.Hliaia certiJied that valvular heart dis
ease was the cause.
Mr. CostellO and the Chinese Six Com
panlÂ«-s took up the matter, with a view to
lixlnn tho responsibility of tho man's
death upon Chief Dunn of the Chinese
bureau. In order that they might not be
without proper evidence, they secured the
services of Dr. Ueorse L. Fitch, the eml
r.ent authority on leprosy, and Dr. B. A.
Atnrbury of the Presbyterian Chinese
Mission on Stockton street. The two doc
tors visited the body shortly before noon
yesterday at the undertaking establish
ment of Wine Sung, on Clay street, near
VVaverly place. To their surprise they
found no marks of an autopsy, the body
being free from all traces of a surgeon's
knife. In order to secure an abundance
of evidence as to the falsity of the Coro
ner's records. Dr. Fitch telephoned for Dr.
W. D. Clark, and when he arrived tht-v
opened tho body and made an autopsy for
the benefit of the Chinese Six Companies.
They found no valvular dl3ease of the
heart, as stated in tho certlilcato of the
autopsy, but fÂ«>und that organ dilated.
but whether sulllolently to cause death
there was not a very decided opinion.
There were no evidences of dropsy, not
withstanding the sworn testimony of Dr.
O'Connor to that effect.
Further examination of the body was
deferred until a quarter-past 4 o'clock !n
the afternoon. Dr. Zabala having been in
vited by telephone to attend. When Dr.
Zabala entered the room and saw the
body lie asked. "How long has this man
lÂ«een dead?" The laughter which followed

topsy surpenn of the Morgue, and he felt
more chagrined still when he was told.
He admitted that he had filled out the
autopsy slip, but said that he had been so
advised by Coroner Hill.
The Chinese Six Companies will hold a
meeting to-day to consult a-" to their fu

MACKAY WILL SOON
BECOME A DIRECTOR OF
THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Hnntington's Special Efforts to Place
Giant Financiers in Control
of the Corporation.
JOHN W. MACKAY.
NEW YORK. Nov. 24 -John W. Ma<kay will within a f.-.v days be elected
a director of the Bouthern Padflc Hallway Coknpany. Mr. Hackay to-day
authorised Tho Call and Herald to state that he has consented to accept
that position, and Inten titled with the company Intimated that
â n will take place befor-- December L
Maikays acceptane <>f this position Is â  significant In many ways.
Although approached scores "f times, he has steadfastly refused to become a
r of railroad corporations, and his conservatism in this regard has become
a byword In W.iU street. That he has decided to ko Into thÂ«* Bouthern Pacific will
be surprising news In tlnam lal circles, particularly In view of the recent chunges
In the control and management of that property.
The Call ascertains that C P. Huntlngton Is making n special effort to place
four stalwart financiers on the board Of directors <>f the Southern Pacific Com
pany. When tho Bpeyer syndicate, acting for Huntlngton. purchased the shares of
Southern Pacific stock owned by the Crocker estate it w;..s stipulated that one of
the two directors representing the Crocker interest should give way to Bpej
sum as the transaction was closed. Presumably a h-lmi'.ar condition w.us made
when the syndic ltÂ« purchased Mrs. Stanford's Stock.
The Crocker and Stanford Interests wÂ«>rr> represented on the board by four
directors, and therefore Huntingdon, Bpeyer Ai Co. aOQUlred the right to select four
new men. although the selection of two of the four may be left open until the
next annual meeting.
John W. liackay*S acceptance creates no surprise In well-posted railway
rlrcl<-s. When the tlrst hint was given that the Bpeyera were negotiating with
a view of buying the stock of the Crockers John W. Ifackay wai advised of tho
â  menta although ho was In Arizona at that time. Mr. Mackay is a multi
millionaire and a man of sound business judgment. He Is familiar with affairs
on the Pacific <'oast and should be able to render the company valu.-tb
â¢ ; tance of tho position does not signify to railroad men that he
has Invested largely In the stock of the company, but rather indicates a pur
pose on the part of C. P. Huntlngton to get men representing vast wealth to
take an active Interest In the management of the corporation.
It is known to a few men In New York and to several In San Francisco that
Mr. Huntlngton wanted I>. < Â». Mills to go on the. Southern I'aclJic directory, but
the rich banker positively declined to accept the position.

FRENNA SWORE
HE WOULD KILL
J. F. TURNER
Witnesses Testify to
Hearing Threats.
Four witnesses went on the stand in
Jtidge Carroll Cook's court yssf rrtsj and
that thoy beard Joseph P. Frenna
threaten to kill Janes W. Turner. The
threat was alleged to have been made OB
two occasions, once al><>ut tw<> wast
fora the assassination <>t Turner am!
:t few days preceding the tragedy in the
Crocker building. The testimony or â¢
four men waa clear and positive, with no
trace of ambiguity, and the frantic at
temptS of counsel for th- | mur
derer t.> confuse the wlti
th. m to admit that they miKht hav
mistaken <t that PVenna miKtn baTÂ«
joking when he voiced his cowardly in
tentlon only resulted in Ui.ir own <!:-4
comflture. ah these wttnesses ar
. with Kau.-r's law . â¢â ction
. and the first to tak-> th" stand
v. as H.irry Morn.-. Morris testified that
Frenna came into RaUOT*S OAce about
tw.> weeki before Turner was. killed.
"Did >>>v hoar him say anything at that
time in regard to Turner?" asked Attor
innon, who la usststlnt; tho prode
"l did," was tho answer.
te ivh.it be .".ud."
<- He said 'The has robbed me.
li.- has ruined m-i and I'll kill him.' "
Morris suid rYenna was conversing
with Cashier Oral at the time. They
were standing at the other side of the
room, hut frenna shouted OUI his threat
t*o loud that it was Impossible for wi
not to bear him. <'n rross f isuilinilon
Morns aaid h.- Kiuv. referred to
Turner because Turner was the subject
of the com ersatlon.
J. J. Bauer was the next witness, and
he t'-M of a vi.-v Prenna made to his
offlce about the Mth <>f August, v f>-w
days before ttio murder. <Â»n that occa
sion he whs accompanied i )V a f rion.l. and
Mr. Graf and Ernest Nellson, s <lÂ«-rk in
the office, were also present. At that tim>
he reiterated the ttir.at to takÂ«> Turner s
life made on the occasion of his former
visit, only varying his language. The
threat as heard t>>- Raver ws
"Turner Is a liar, a thief and a â ,
and be ought to be in Ban Qut-ntln and
you know It, and I'll kill him."
Attorney Hosmer attempted to show
that Raver was Interested In securing the
conviction of Frenna. but met with an
emphatic If somewhat Inelegant denial.
"Tumor was no friend of mine," de
clared the witness, "and I have known
Prenna for years. If 1 were not sub
penaed I would not be here."
Ernest C Neilson, who followed his
employer on the stand. said ho was sit
ting within three feet of Frenna when the
latter made the threat quoted by ltaucr
and beard him distinctly.
"You are sure you could not have been
mistaken?" said Mr. llosmor, question
ingly.
â¢1 am positive I could not," was the
ready answer.
"Is it not a fact that on a certain oc
casion when you were in the ofllco of Dr.
Cool on Kearny street you admitted that
you might have been mistaken when you
said Prenna threatened to kill Turner?"
"It Is not. I went to Dr. Cool's o!" on
business, but as the doctor was busy I
had to wait in his reception room. While
there I was addressed by that man over
there (pointing to L. S. Mcgglnson. sit
ting by the Side Of Frenna), who brought
up the subject of Turner's dealings with
Frenna."
lln said Megglnson tried to get him to
admit that he might have been mistaken,
but ho hail declared that he could not
possibly be mistaken In this Instance.
Hosmcr dropped Neilson and District
Attorney Murphy In a loud aside said. "I
guess he Wished he had left that boy
alone."
R. J. Graf, Rauer'* son-in-law and
cashier, who was present on both occa
â¢â ions, corroborated the other witnesses
in < ( tv detail.
The next important feature of the day's
proceedings was the lestlmonv of th.
widow an l brother of the murdered man,
corroborated by that of half a dozen
other witnesses, to tho 1 effect that Turner
hail a habit when walking or standing of
placing 111-* right hand behind his back.
Mr. Murphy explained to the court that
he expected to show that suss of this
habit one of the bullets from the mur
derer's revolver, although he was .-'lot
from behind, passed through his hand
and the roll of parchment he held. The
court then overruled the objections.
In the morning W. A. Gastenberg and
F. W. Blumb, the two men who turned the
body over on Its back, testified, but .aside
from the fact mentioned their testimony
was Immaterial.
Detective Dillon was put on the stand
and testified that although he lÂ«ad
search. everywhere for Willie Walsh,
the messenger boy who is supposed to
have been one of the first at the scene
