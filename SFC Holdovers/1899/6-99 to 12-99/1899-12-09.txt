METHUEN'S POSITION
IS NOT TOO SECURE
IvONDON. Pec. B.â Such disquiet as was
caused in London by the news that Gen
cm] Methm-n"Â« communications had been
cut at Gras Pan was IWtlnK. for infor
mation reached the War Office at mid
night that the BritiFh commander at Mod
drr Rlxor had again hern heard from. It
was also Uarnea that General RabinKton
liad arrived at Muddrr River to take com
mand of thÂ»- cavalry, presumably taking
up with htm the major portion of a
brigade.
Almost ritnulLaneously me a brief dis
patch indicating that the long expected
:<dvance for thÂ«- relief of Ladysmith had
txfrun. This Important nÂ«*ws was con-
TiJnr'd In an acmcy Kl^cram from Pre
tnrln. raying that an nffl<iai report from
:Â» .â¢ I... 0r head la-igrr nÂ»>ar Lxdysmlth was
to thf cfTect that the British were ad
vancing on Colenso. From the date of

The San Francisco Call
I even on the seenÂ© of General Methuen's
i dnarly bought victory.
Pessimists regarded the Isolation of
I Methurn's none too large force as a seri
| ous matter, especially as General Gat acre
j does not seem able to .... much hen,i-
I way from the direction of Siormberg
i Junction.
While the Boers must number quite
15.<Â»\> mÂ«>n. the original force which fought
at Modder River having been reinforced
from Kimberley, J.-tcohrdahl and Bloem
fontein. It must not be forgotten that
Methuen. too. Â»n his part has been rein
forced. Although many regiments have
lorn heavily, he must command now
nearly 11.000 men.
On the Natal side there is pood reason
to uaieve that an action is imminent. The
difficult work of bridging the Tugela
River in the face of the enemy must be
the first step.
The Boers around Ladysmith are re
ported to be prep-irtn^ string positions In
which heavy â¢â¢â â â¢â¢â¢ being mounted be
hind masonry.
On Thursday heavy firing was heard
from Frero Camp In the direction of the
beleaguered town. This was probably a
Boer arwauit. and it is to be prcpumctf
that It was repulsed.
Little fear. In fact. Is felt for the safety
of a camp where after a prolonged *lege
the soldiers hold their athletic sports as
usual and officers indulge their love for
polo. Nor does meat at a shilling or
bread at four pence a pound suggest the
near prospect of famine.
The persistent shelling of a hospital
within the British lines Is reported in
spite of the Red Cross Hag which waves
above it nnd the repeated protests of Sir
George White. On November 30 a shell
fell right ir. the building, killing one man
and wounding nine others. It is of
course, impossible to attribute .this to ac
cident.
As to Mafeking all kinds of reports are
current, rome of which point to a possi
bility that the Beige has already been
raised.
The fact that from the end of last month
dispatches from Colonel Baden-Powell and
various correspondents have been com
lng through from the beleaguered town
very much quicker would appear to bear
out the Lelicf that the nie S e became
weaker since General Cronje's force was
called south to reinforce the Boers at
Modder River and around Klmberley.
Colonel -laden-Powell himself, under date
Of November 23. said that all was uâ¢â¢ I ;
that the l.ombardment was Intermittent,
and that the besieging force was now
much weaker.
A message from Magalapye announced
that preparations had been completed for
an advance in force for the purpose, of
repairing the railway line Â»d restoring
communication with Marking. A dis
patch from Modder River, dated lutMon
day, raid that the whole Mafeking com
mando had joined the Klmberley forces.
Finally; a telegram from Orange River
under date of TuÂ«ndriY. says that reports
are current that Mafeking has been re
lieved.

WASHINGTON, Dec. S.â Former Sena
tor Don Cameron Of Pennsylvania tin*
come to Washington to take a hand In
the Quay fight. He was at the <*apltol
this afternoon conferring wirh his former
colleagues with a view to securing pledgts
favors) â¢ to seating Mr. Quay.
Mr. Cameron's presence here shows that
he !m Alarmed over the situation, and it
13 evident, too, that Mr. Quay Is becom
ing uneasy, for he has derided to rut
short Ms trip South and return to Wash*
lngton next week. Mr. Cameron and Mr.
Quay both have privilege* of the floor of
the Senate, and they will, therefore, have
no illfJlculty in getting In close communi
cation with all the Senators now in tne
doubtful column.
An adverse report from the Committee
on Elections is now certain. It was
stated to-day that Republican member
ship of this committee Is not to be in
creased, and there Is no truth, therefore.
In the report that the committee had put
off the hearing of former Senator Ed
munds and other counsel until December
IS in order to allow time for a caucua
committee to aiM other Republicans to
the committee.
The committee, having the organization
of three other committees In charge, has
decided to Increase the membership of
those committees which have to do with
matters affecting public works and' pol
icy. The Election Committee Is not In
cluded In the list.

had tho depositions of relatives of the

was incurable, basing his opinion upon

WASHINGTON. Dec. &.â Brigham Rob
erts' address to the American people was
answered to-day by a delegation repie
sentlng the Gentile element In Utah, widen
If here to oppose Roberts. The answer is
as follows:
In this morning"* papers Mr. Robert* makes
an appeal fir sympathy In which are many
I statements needing correction, while many
facts .-.re lupprwsed.
Mr. Roberta claims that the precedent made
I by his exclusion U bath new juiJ dangsroa*.
That It .* not m was conclusively shown by
M: Taylor in hi able legal argument before
i the li dm arid not a single- precedent to the
ecatrary wan cited where the ground or ub-
I Jertlcn was tnellsiblllty. Neither is the pn i â¢â â

I lygamM he lfc atain suffering lrcm civil
disability under the Edmund* anti-polygamy
act. such a member, refusing even to deny
the char?*, should be excluded. Nor Is this
dangerous, for it (â  not lik-ly. as 'â¢'â¢ Rob

01 nil Representatives of a large .State are I
ermine to Coneress carrying such a burden. ,
li ether States men rho flaurt their violations
; or these laws of decency In the /ace of the
public are s-nt to the penitentiary. It Is only
in- Utah where such indecency ever ad*d to
one's ... and served as a recommenda
tion to political preferment
Mr Roberts' contention that no evidence of ,
his guilt can Â»>-â¢ received except . a Judicial
reccrd of his conviction in Utah, as â  matter !
of law is erroneous, and. as -i matter of prac
tice dangerous, because Mr. Robert* ana his
all-pewerlul and Inspired priesthood can pre
vi-nt such conviction If they consider It worth
: while. i. :
Mr Roherts claims that whatever were h's
civil disabilities before statehood, they were
n moved by the adoption of the State constltu- â¢
ti-n If at the time of the passage " f the
enabling act Mr. Roberts was. as he frtrai in |
his appeal to admit, disfranchised by act of
Kress and. therefore, not a full cttUsn
i ..' the United States, as by the constitution
he must ), to become a member of Congress. |
tl.er. he Is still in th. same condition, because ;
' the constitution of I'tnh ctuM not restore him
to Federal citizenship, and the enabling art
did r.rt do It The enabling act of Utah, un- ,
, like that of some other States, required citi- ,
I zenship of the United States as a qualification
for ting and did not confer that cUtseashlp
upon those then not such citizens. Hence Mr.
Roberts 1 statement that by Utah becoming a
State he was rehabilitated with the wanting .
attributes of citizenship Is unwarranted.
Mr. Roberts f ays he has not been convicted ,
1 since statehood. It does nnt follow that he is
i inurcent. He is now a furtive from Justice in
Salt I-Â»ke County on a charge of unlawful co
habitation, and in Davis County. Utah, where,
reside* one of his polygamous wives, with her
Illegitimate twins, born on August 11. ls9i: a
charge of adultery <* felony under the laws of
Utah) has been for two months pigeon-holed by j
a Mormon Prosecuting Attorney. .
Mr Roberts. In hU attempt to belittle his
crimes. Insists that he In only charged with
a misdemeanor. He knows better. He knows (
ttnt he has been, under oath and before the
proper prosecuting officers, charged with the
felony of adultery as will as the misdemeanor
lof unlawful cohabitation. He asserts that In
1 1Â«J he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor only.
I and also says that if he were guilty of the
I same acts In the District of Columbia, "even
flagrantly so," as n member of Congress he
could not be arrested therefor, for it is only a
misdemeanor. Here again Mr. Roberts states
J what is not true, and he ought to know It. In
l.iwtul cohabitation, under the Edmunds art.
under which he pleaded guilty, was a felony.
as also is adultery, with which Mr. Roberts Is
charged in Davis County. Utah. In the Dis
trict of Columbia both unlawful cohabitation
and adultery ars felonies. an deflned by thÂ»
Utah statutes, and it Is only in Utah that the
former Is a misdemeanor.
These charge*, In view of the Edmunds and
Edmunds-Tucker laws of the United States,
still in force, warrant Mr. Roberts' exclusion.
I They are aggravated, however, because his Is
not an Isolated case, but one representative of
! a system.
Many sentimental people are being misled j
by Mr. Roberts' very Ingenious ' suggestions
from which some people infer that he took his
polygam wives when It was lawful to do
so. This is a mistake. Adultery was a crime
In Utah when Mr. Roberts was born, and at
i the time of the pnssajre of the Cullom anti
polygamy net Mr." Roberts was only six years
eld. His plea for sympathy therefore amounts
j only to this: That he should be allowed to
continue his criminal practices, notwithstand- .
' ing he took his polygamous wives in deAan c
lof law. We demand that he should supi>ort
his families, but also demand that be shall
ceare the begetting of further Illegitimate off
spring, and this 1* our only bone Of contention,
the only thing demanded which he refuse* to ,
yield. In this matter we disclaim any desire '
to have him declared Ineligible because he is
a Mormon, bat solely because he is violating
and defying the law* of our State, of the
United States and of common decency.
Ex-Congressman W. H. King was and 1* a
Mormon, and no claim of tnelig'.bllltv was ever
made â¢gainst him. We point to this fact as
showing that we opiwse Mr. Roberts not upon I
1 the ground of any religious opinions entertained

Nominations at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. B.â
The Associated Students at Stanford met
this afternoon and nominated candidates
for football manager and editor In chief
of the Dally Palo Alto. For the former
; by him. but because of his criminal practices.
Neither Is this a matter of religious or politi
cal i>er*ccutlon or prejudice. The undesigned
; Include men of different churches and men who
i belong to 00 church, those who are Republicans
and those who are Democrats.
Mr. Roberts denies 1 , and we assert, that the
compact between Utah and tin: other States
has been 'violated. That compact was Â«vl
denced by many public acts, as fellows:
, First âBy the manifesto of the Mormon
j church in lSfi>. which by their lending men
j was Interpreted under oath to prohibit the
] continuance of polygamous rslat'.cns M well as
â  the contractlnÃ of " new polygamous marriages.
I Secondâ By the. Utah Legislature. wh:ch In
I .lS'ii made unlawful cohabitation- as well as
polygamy a crime against tho Territory-
Thirdâ tho eolemn pledges of the apostles
of this alleged church that that* Jaws would
\ be obeyed and enforced, which pledge waa made
I In b .-it to the President praying for a
General amnÂ«st] proclamation.
Fourthâ By the declarations made by the citi
zens of Utah before â¢!â . Congressional commit
tee having- the enabling act under considera
â  tion, where also the foregolnsr evidences and
statements were used to secure statehood.
Fifthâ By the declaration in the constitution
of Utsh that polygamous marriages shall be
; forever prohibited.
| Sixthâ The not of the Constitutional Cor.veni
i tlcn continuing In force the Territorial laws
punishing unlawful cohabitation as well as
polygamy, of which convention Mr. Roberts
. was a ,i.i 1 â â¢!â¢.
All the3e public acts combined show conclus
ively that the compact Includes the dlscontlnu
ence of old polygamous relations as well as the
prevention of new ones. As evidence that this
'â â â in] ... has been broken we point to the fol
lowing:
Flrst-That in Utah IS9O illegitimate children
have been born to polygamous wives since
statehood.
ndâ That about 2000 polygamous house
holds now exist In Utah, and that the attempt
to secure a punishment of these offenders Is
dr^ounccd by the majority, as we believe of
1 Ltah's citizens. - .
Thirdâ Thit thÂ» circumstantial evidence un
mij-takably points to the existence of new wives
in polygamous households, the most conspicu
ous examples of which are the cases *' Apostleb
Abraham H. Cannon. John W. "fiylor and
Apostle Tuesdale. in at least the first of which
the church organ of the dominant church re
ruses to deny the marriage, and the new poly
amous wife Is employed as a teacher In a
church academy.
' t>Â£ 0I0 I7 Th . at the very men who Interpreted
the _ manifesto of tSN to prohibit unlawful co
habitation with prior acquired wives now pub
llcly Justify Its continuance.
â¢ That moft of th- name men who In
a petition for amnesty pledged their sacred
honor for the obedience of the law by their
| people are now by example and precept en
; couraging the commission of the crime of un
, lawful cohabitation.
Sixthâ As a further evidence of this bad faith
we call attention to the faot that the men
holding church offices have pleaded guilty to
the crime of unlawful cohabitation before the
State courts without having their church stand
ing affected, even In some cases having their
| fines paid by sympathetic friends.
Seventhâ All this Is by necessary Implication
Indorsed by a majority of Utah's people In the
. election of Brtgham H. Roberts, who. during
i his campaign for election, was publicly churged
with being â  violator of the laws, as evidenced
by his illegitimate progeny, and in spite of
these undented charges he was elected by an
overwhelming majority.
Thnt Mr. Roberts himself understood that
compact to mean the discontinuance of unlaw
ful cohabitation, we point to his registration
cath of JS?3. In which he swore It to be his
intention to obey the law prohibiting unlawful
cohabitation., â¢

The Labor Council at its meeting laat
night declined to recede from Its former
position on the bond issue for the Park
Panhandle. The cause which led the
council to reartirm Hh previous position
was a communication from Gustave

sociation, which haa the bond issue at
heart, asking that a committee from his
organization be allowed to appear before
the council and explain the benefits to
be derived from the park extension.
The council, in answer to thlÃ request
rt-allinr.od its previous vote condemning
the bond issue n.r the panhandle, but sup
ported the Issue for the schools, sewers
and hospital, and In conclusion Invited
Mr. Sennet- to hire a hall In which a pub
lic debate of the issue could be had The
Labor Council promised to furnish speak
ers who will be prepared to combat Mr
Schnee's views.
A delegation from the Junk dealers
were present asking for affiliation. They

DISASTROUS DAY
FOR MOLINEUX
Numerous Triumphs for
the Prosecution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. B.â Several interest
ing points developed to-day in connec
tion with the trial of Roland H. Molineux
for the murder of Mrs. Katherine J. Ad
ams. .First there was the capture of an
Important witness for the prosecution.
This was Mamie Mullands, the young
woman who cared for ltollnÂ«ux'i rooms
at Newark. Through a ruse on the part
of detectives she was induced to cross the
State line from New .Jersey to Suffern,
New York, and when once within the
Jurisdiction of the New lork State au
thorities she was placed under arrest and
brought to New York City. It is said
she will be placed on the stand by the
State and compelled to testify that Mol
ineux was accustomed to Me the now
famous blue paper surmounted by three
Interlaced crescents.
This same paper made its appearance
in the case later in the day, when George
William Hall of Moodus. Conn., waÂ»
called to testify concerning a letter
which fell into the possession of his m
ployer. Professor Fowler. The witness
said that James Burns of Detroit. Mich.,
Fold a great many letters to Professor
Fowler, who dealt in medical remedies;
that the signature "Roland B. Molineux"
was noticed, and the New York authori
ties were notified of the llnd.
The defense admitted the Identity of
this letter as having been written by
the defendant. This is considered an Im
portant point, owing to th>- fact that it
was written upon blue paper, with the
crescents, and the defense has acknowl
edged the writing of It.
The legal battles to-day ranged around
the question of expert testimony and
th<- admisalbility of handwriting when
"not disputed." Attorney w.eks fouKht
bravely for his client, but In the end thr
prosecution triumphed, the Recorder say-
Ing that the court would be forced to
consider the exhibits as being in tin
handwriting of the defendant unless the
testimony of the witness. Expert Kins
ley, should be impeached or contradicted
by tiie defense in some manner. It
seemed to be a day of victories for the
proÂ»ecution. for the specimens of hand
writing written by Molineux before his
arrest and at the time Corn'.sh was under
suspicion were admitted, as was also the
diagnosis of a blank of a patent medicine
concern with the blanks filled out In
handwriting, said to be the same as that
of the other letters in evidence and signed
"H. C. Barnet." In the face of strenuous
objections Expert Kinsley was permitted
to testify that in his opinion Molineux
wrote the address on the poison package
sent to Harry Cornish.
DRIVEN INSANE BY THE
GHGST OF HER HUSBAND
OAKLAND. Dec. B.â Constantly recur
ring remembrance-* df the death of her
husband, which occurred nearly fifteen
years ago, and laboring under the belief
that he was buried alive, and the horror
of his ghost following her wherover she
goes, is given as the cause that unhinge.i
the mind of Mrs. Anna Oeuder, who,
after wandering about, sleeping in grave
yards and trying to starve herself to
death, attempted to commit suicide
yesterday afternoon by Jumping off the
wharf at Kmcryvllle.
The unfortunate woman was examined
for insanity to-day and was committed
by Judge Greene to the asylum at Bto k
tÂ«Â»n. She had previously declared that her
husband wan follywing her and hounding
her until she could stand it no longer.
To-day, however, her daughter, Mrs. Lll
lle Dawson of San Francisco, in com
pany with several friends, called at the
Receiving Hospital ami stated thai Wil
liam Geuder, the husband, had died nearly
fifteen years ago. and that constant wor
rying over the sad event had finally re
sulted in breaking the mother down "men
tally, and that the mother frequently
imagines that the spirit or ghost of hÂ«r
husband haunts and follows her wher
ever she s><c<.
Mrs. Geuder. it appears too, had left
her home. 135 Dolores street. San Fran
cisco, about two weeks ago, and her rela
tives have since been searching for her
In every quarter, finally locating hoi
through a telephone message sent to th>
daughter by Keener of the Insane Page
at the Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Geuder seemed somewhat calmed
to-day and no longer refuses to partake
of substantial food, but she still insists
that her husband was buried alive by the
Schu*tien Veretoi fifteen years ago and
that his ghost is constantly after her.
The doctors give out little hopes of her
ever recovering her reason.

me exrect that Dinsmorc nrst poisoned his wife in the rooms of the couple
upsuir*. He then came down and informed hÂ«Â»r of what he had done and
tnnt DC was going to "finish the Job." He went into an adjoining room, where
LAve was Bleeping:, and shot htm. Lave was killed Instantly. Mrs. Dinsmoro
was piw.iM. priissic add being used.
After khootins I-aue. DlnFmore brought the body of his wife down Into the
Kitchen and left It where It was found by the neighbors when they were
called in.
Tiie motive fcr th<Â» crime was Infatuation for Mrs. Lao*. She says Dinsmore
fcad repeatedly urged her to dope with him. but she had refused. Dinsmore had
Intended to commit the crime on Thanksgiving night, but Mi Lave says she per
t-unded him net to do It. After the murders had been committed Dinsmore told
Mr*. L.-iue what to tell and she adhered to It until the time of making her
confession. She .-.flirms that Dlnsnmrc was gifted with hypnotic power and that
under its Influence she did as he directed.
The brother? of Mrs. Dln?more pay that he exercised the same Influence over

KBARNET. Nc*.. IVc. S.â The situation to-night looked so ominous for the
Kifoty of Frank Dlnsmoro that Sheriff Punk decided to take no chances and
necordhiKly took hla prisoner to North riatte for safekeeping. Since the con
fession or Mrs. I-ane there had Â«a talk of lynching the prisoner. Dinsmore
was terribly nervous and frightened and wanted the guards to keep close to the
cab that took him to the railway station. The fact that the prisoner was to be
taken awr\y was not generally known, consequently there was little excitement.
The move to have a lynching baa had not matured, but the authorities feared It
would during the night. Everybody is glad the man has been taken to another

FOR INVESTIGATION OF
"BULL PEN" OUTRAGES
Conduct of General Merriam and His Regulars During the Reign
of Terror in the Coeur d'Alenes Brought to the
Attention of Congress.
1 JL T ASHTNGTON, Dec. B.â Representative Lentz of Ohio to-day Introduced a joint resolution reciting the
â / Â»/ charges growing out of the presence of United States troops under Brigadier General Merriam at the
centers of mining troubles in Idaho and asking for an investigation by a special committee of nine members to
be appointed by the Speaker. The resolution says that it is a matter of general information that United States
troops were sent to Idaho in defiance of and contrary to the Federal constitution, at the individual request of
the Governor, when no riot or insurrection existed, and without consulting the Legislature or the local Sheriff.
It is nssertfd that General Merriam declared martial law and arbitrarily and without warrant of law arrested
hundreds of citizens and held them under "most brutal and tyrannical conditions," The arrests, it is charged,
included many members of the Miners' Union and the local Sheriff. It is asserted that many men were
imprisoned in a "bull pen. a place unfit for human habitation."
The allegation is made that one prisoner became insane from the treatment, and, escaping, was shot as
he jumped into a river. In another case, it is charged, a dying prisoner was denied spiritual consolation. Spe
cific acts of cruelty are given, including compulsory standing erect for seven hours each day in the hot sun,
under penalty of death if attempt was made to move or sit down. It is alleged also that a captain under Gen
eral Merriam "amused" himself by calling prisoners "cowardly curs" while these punishments were being in
flicted. The resolution also asserts that the wives and families of the miners were insulted by soldiers, and it is
alleged that responsibility for the various actions recited rests with the mining companies of the localities.

taunted some of the majority leaders with

that thry had learned â¢omething with ad

Roberts, the Mormon Representative
elect from Utah, was not In the House
when the MMlon began to-day. It was
agreed Immediately after the. reading of
the Journal that when the House ad
journed It should be to meet on Monday.
Dalzell of Pennsylvania, from the Com
mittee on Rules, presented the amend
ments to the rules agreed upon by the
committee for the creation of a Commit
tee on Insular Affairs, to consist of seven

over all man- is (excepting those afT> â¢â¢â¢t

ermanently â¢dealing" with the isl

Dalzeli held that there was nothing in
the resolutions which intimated that the
committee was to deal with our islands
permanently. The resolution was udopt
ed without division.
Dalzeli then offered the resolution for
the consideration of the currency bill. it
provided for general debate, oeglnning
next Monday, until next Friday; debate
under the nve-mlnute rule on Saturday,
and a vote upon the bill immediately
arier â¢i,- reading of the journal on Mon

deposition upon the part of the majority
to unduly press the bill. It presented sim

debated in the House. The Committee on
Rules war, of the opinion that the resolu

Richardson upon behalf of the minority
â aid he dissented most emphatically from
the pi (position advanced by Dalzel! that
the bill to be considered contained noth
ing radically new. For the nrst time In
history it was proposed by statutory pro
visions to fasten the fold standard upon
the country. If such a suggestion bad
been made two or three years ago. he
said, half the other side would have been
up in arms against it. Be considered the
rule unusual and unjust to the minority.
But one day was to bo given the minority
to study the bill, while- members of the
majority had six months in which to pre
pare themselves. Richardson taunted thÂ«
majority with their sudden change of
base
Bailey of Texas declared that the pro
posed courso of the majority was without
precedent or defense. He made an elab
orate argument to prove that it wa.i a
proposition to hastily determine a ques
tion to which the best and most careful
consideration should be given.
Grosvcnor of Ohio, In support of the
rule, argued that it could not be Justly
said tnat It would unduly curtail debate
and consideration. An to the charge thai
members of the majority would rind it
dlillcult to explain their change of front,
he said It was one of the proudest boasts
of th. Republican party that It was wiser
now than it wns a good many years ago.
"The Democratic party," said he, "is the
only well recognized demonstration of a
great organization which has survived a
long period without learning anything.
The past of the Republican party is be
hind it; of Its present it is proud, and its
future is assured. Can tiie gentleman
from , i mi' <<Â»â¢â Â«.â¢ say as much?"
"Was the future of this bill assured un
til after the caucus had been held?" asked
Richardson, amid Democratic applause.
"There never was a caucus in this
House."" replied Grosvenor, "which came
together with such unanimity of purpose
as that which indorsed this bill.' [Re
publican applause.)
Cannon of Illinois, In response to the
thrust of Richardson, frankly said that
he had voted for free coinage of silver In
IS7S. but he had done so because of th*
impending resumption of specie payments
when the Democratic party was Howling
for flat money. But specie payments had
been resumed without disaster despite the
Democratic howls. Since then the coun
try had been on the gold standard.
Dalz*U Closed the debate by recalling
some of the rules under which the Demo
crats had forced through important bills
In the Fifty-second and Kifty-tl..rd Con
gresses. He referred particularly to the
adoption of the conference report In the
Fifty-second Congress upon the tariff bill
which "the greatest Democrat since An
drew Jackson, Grovcr Cleveland (derisive
laughter on the Democratic side), 'had
pronounced a piece of party perfidy and
dishonor." He described this procedure 'â 
as a "rape of all precedents." and cited
other cases where ho said "gag rule" had
been employed. â¢
Richardson attempted to reply to these
statements, but Dalzeli refused to yield
and the special order was adopted, 188 to
144. a strict party vote. /
Robertson of Louisiana then announced
the death of the late Representative 8. O.
Baird of Louisiana; and after the adop
tion of the customary resolutions at 1:30
fi. m.. as a further mark of respect, thÂ©
louse adjourned until Monday.

One Measure Provides for Territorial
Form of Government.
WASHINGTON, Dec. S.â Represent at 1 ye

provide a Territorial form of government
for Hawaii. It is similar to the measure
reported to the House last year proving
a Territorial Governor appointed by ihe

Democrats Displeased.
WASHINGTON, Dec S.-The Democrat
ic caucus r< mmlttce of the Senate to-day
considered the reorganization of the Sen
nte committee^. A disposition was mani
fested to resist the demand of the Repwn

definite conclusion was reached. The
Democrats are especially displeased with
the prospect of not being able to fill one
of the vacancies on the Finance Commit

BRADLEY REPLIES
TO JUDGE TARVIN
Says the Jurist Kept a
Cowardly Silence.
Pp-<-lal Dispatch to The Call.
FRANKFORT. Dec. Bâ Governor Brad

I'ly to an lnter\iew by Judge Janus }'.

authorities and holding them responsible
J-t me Maysville mob. The Govern-. r
this afternoon wired Mr. Tarvin. asking
him if he had been correctly reported and
received the following reply:
The penalty given Coleman may be
considered Just, but the failure o* Urn
State authorities to protect him after he
In custody is wrong, and any citizen
has a rljjni t<> criticise it. The ract that

only the n. . for protecting him.
.:â¢ telegram means Ji^ht 1 have the
: as ana choose cannon, you
to stay at Frankfort and I at Cuvinglon.
IMi-ase don't send the militia."
The Governor, commenting on the
above, said: â¢â¢This dispatch Is character
1-11'- i f the man. If the penalty given
('uloman by the people waa just, why
should Tarvln object? As to his proposi
tion to remain in Covlnjgton and tight a
gentleman in Frankfort, persons who
Know him v.in Se astonished to learn he
Is willing to lisht, even at that distance."
The Governor closes his statement by
saying:
"As Governor I have done everything In
my power to protect human life and en
force the law. If I had known, as Judge
Tarvln knew, that this man was about to
1.0 taken to his death at the hands of a
mob. I would not have kept a cowardly
silence as he did, but would have protect
ed him. BSver since J'i<lk<- Tarvin was
seised with the Idea that h â¢ was Vice

constant watch on him. This latest ef
fuslon is additional evidence that he is

FACULTY EASY WITH WHIPPLE.
California's Captain Suspended Until
the Ist of January.
BERKELEY, Dec. B.â At Its meeting to
day the academic council decided to pun
ish Football Captain Whipplc for directly
defying its order in regard to the Thanks
giving game, by suspending him from the
university until January I, l&OO. In the
meantime he is forbidden to appear on the
university ground*. i"he sentence Ii re
garded among the students as most mod
erate, and their kindly feeling toward the
authorities in return for this evidence of
regard for student opinion is little affected
by thf* strictures on Captain Whlpple's
action utten-d at the meeting of the As
sociated Students this mornintr by Colonel
Edwards, chairman of the faculty com
mittee on athletics.
Colonel Edwards, after congratulating
the students and university on the splen
did showing of California athletics, said:
"There Is one thing, however, about this
latest victory that spoils it for every stu
dent and friend of the university." Ten
of the men who played that game are de-
Ferving of all prnlÂ«e; the eleventh (mean
ing \\ hippie) did not belong there, and
his* presence In the play put the whole uni
versity 'off ride." â â¢
James Hopper, quarterback of the team.
replied to Colonel Edwards, questioning
whether any supporter of lie university
regretted \\ Ihppios presence In the rush
line. He for one had not and he approved
of the captain's action, which was. in
fact, the only one 'pen to him.
"It was not simply as an Individual
player that \\ nipple went into the con
test. Every man In the team there, and
the coaches, too, demanded that he should
personally direct the g-ime."
Hopper also spoke against the rule un
der which Whlpple was disbarred, and the
meeting passed the. following resolution
with regard to It :
VherÂ»-as. Wit. the Associated Students of thÂ»
University of California, believe the present
; faculty rule conr^ralag the eligibility of ath
lete* to be unjust, unnecessarily severe, and
of Â»urh a nature as to Injure the university;
bu It
Renrtlx-ed. That â¢Â«â¢<â¢. the aanelatÂ«d Students.
d<i respectfully petition the academic council
of the university to repeal the said rule.

SHALL SPORTS BE ADDED TO WEST POINT CURRICULUM?
By
President Benjan)in Ide Wheeler.
T.ast Thursday Sonat.-ir Ornridler Intro.lucod a bill in tho United States Senate to provide that athletics should be
come a repular part of the currirulum at West Point and Annapolis. His idea la to pay less attention to the higher
mental training and to qualify and stimulate our young men for military service by utiitable physical training in
stead of excessive mental education. Here- are the views of President Wheeler and President Jordan on Senator Chand
lers bill:
I CAN say only this, that I think it was a wise action on the
part of the War Department and the Navy Department to
permit the cadets to play football. For some time there
was decided opposition to It, but Roosevelt, when he was
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, with the assent of Secretary
Lob#7. gave encouragement to the reopening of the. old. practice
of football playing, and I think that was wise.
Any movement which will encourage a training in ath
letic sports in the naval and military schools will. I th'.nk.
prove a most Important assistance to the scheme of training
which Is necessary In order to develop the best type of man
hood in those school?. More than that, being unfamiliar at the
present time with the full scope of Senator Chandler'a bill
I am unable to ray. BENJAMIN* IDE WHEELER

AMONG AMATEUR ATHLETES.
University of California Is Restored
to Good Standing In the Pacific
Association.
The regular monthly .meeting of the
board of governors of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union
was held last night. It was stated that
a sum of nearly $400 had been received
by the association as its share of the
fund collected some years ago for the
purpose of sending a team of athletes
from the University of California to the
Eastern States. The handbook of rec
ords, rules and by-laws of the association
Is nearly ready for publication, and will
be issued on January 1. 1900. Arrange
ments will be made for an indoor baseball
tournament between teams of the Olym
pic and Reliance Athletic clubs, the
Young Men's Christian Association and
the Stockton Athletic Association. The
board set aside the sum of OS for the pur
chase of a trophy to be presented to the
winning team, but the details of the
games will be arranged by the managers
and committees of the various clubs. The
board will merely draw .up the schedule
and see that the competitors are ama
teurs.
President J. R. Bockman announced
that the. University of California Had
paid $15 due the association as sanction
fees for football games. The university
was accordingly restored to good rtand
ing. The Grammar School Athletic
League was stricken from the roll for
non-payment of annual dues.
The Olympic Club'!* new handball court
will be ready for play on New Year's day.
and arrangements will be made for a
handball tournament between the various
clubs In the association. George James,
captain of the Olympic Club. In his ca

CHICAGO, Dec. B.â Jack Bennett of
McKeesport. Pa., was given the decision
over Owen Ziegler of Philadelphia here
to-night after six rounds of the i
Hind of work. The decision was very
unj. l'pular. ns the majority nf t ho
tators appeared to be of the opinion that
Ziegler. who had forced the fighting all
the way. should have had the big end of
the purse.

I DO not think that athletics should be officially coddled by
making sports obligatory or part of the course of Instruction
in any scnool. Their place is to take the overflow of high
spirits of student-.; a voluntary side issue not part of the
serious business.
The student will not and ought not to give his whole energy
to his studies. Athletic* furnish a safe and natural outlet for
his surplus energy. Th<>rÂ» is danger of Individual excess and
danger of semi-professionalism. To all this university authorir
ties re alive. So long as athletics are. rationally handled their
Influence for good Is very great. It is our business to see that
it is kept so.
As to scholarship, while training makes some Interruption
-mil while there have been some stupid or weak athletes on
the whole the standing of our football men. intelligently, mor
ally and effectively, has been above that of th* average of the
Students, DAVID STARR JORDAN.
MANY BOXLRS IN TRAINI\G.
Manager Long of the Ve-t.-rn Athletic
Club has matched Joe Kennedy and Etas-
Bell, the heavy-weight boxers, for â  twen
ty-round bout, on the 27th lnst. The claim
is made for Russell that in his first fight
1. <â¢!-Â«â¢ he suffered from something akin to
mage fright. He met Van Busklrk, a lum
bering big fellow, and both made a bad
Impression. Since then Russell, who Is
big enough to fight a Riant, has been box
ins with Aleck Groggalns, and is said to
have improved. There was *>> much room
for such â  possibility, it is probable he
has. In Kennedy he will meet one of the
cleverest boxers oi any weight In the
country.
1 Ik- preliminary will be between Sammy
Maxwell and Jimmy Lawlor, if they can
agree on weights. Maxwell wants to box
at 132 pounds, while Lawlor Is holding out
for 133.
Kid Parker and Rufe Turner will meet
In the arena at Woodward's Pavilion next
Friday night before the National Club.
The bout has attracted unusual attention,
owing to the showing; mads by Turner In
this city, added to Parker's reputation,
earned cnle .v In Denver. Turner dis
posed of Jimmy Keilly and Sammy Max
well so handily as to mark him a possible
candidate for championship honors.- Par
ker afllrms he did not come 3000 miles to
be whipped by the colored boy, ami ex
presses the utmost confidence In being
able to lower his colors.
The preliminary bout will be between
Willie Cole and Clarence Ritchie, the lat
ter a Chicago boxer or repute. Cole's
most important engagement was with
clever Jimmy Anthony.
Matchmaker Greggalns of San Fran
cisco Athletic Club has arranged pome
promising bouts for next Tuesday even-
Ing. The principal bout will be between
Henry Lewis ana J. J. Gibbets. The other
boxers matched are: Bud Terry and Jules
Tlllman: Charles Rochette and Charles
Fredericks; Toby Irvine and Jerry Col
lins. The principal bout will be of ten
rounds, the other eight rounds each. Aleck
Greggalns will, as usual, referee all the
matches and will keep the men up to their
work.
Vlckers, who made so sad an attempt
at faking on Thursday night, Is said to
have bet $300 that his opponent would win.
Vickers was favorite at odds of 10- to 3.
and would have made a nice killing had
not Referee McGlnley declared all bets off.
TRACK RECORDS FALL.

KEW ORLEANS, Dec. B.â Two track

DINNER FOR NEWSBOYS.
Volunteers of America Putting the
Project Through.
The VoltS â¢â¢ of America are he?",
arranging for the big Christmas dinner
they propose to give tho s<*) nnd odd
newsboys of the city and are already
around nmong phllanthronlcally Incline i
citizens soliciting contribution! of ihe
many things they will need. Judging
from the list of thing! the volunteers will
require In their !.i^ charitable work, that
dinner Is to be about a.Â«Â« (well a thing of
its kind as will be found on Nob I 1 ill or
any other aristocratic quarter of town on
the day when Christmas dinners are In
order. For example. 300 pounds of turkey
will be needed beside* a hundred or so
pounds each of mutton and Vert. Two
and a half hundred pies will also bÂ» re
quired, beside! half â  ton of candles,
cranberries by the barrel and all the
other things that will tend to tick] ihe
taste of an underfed newsboy. '
if more thnn the amounts named are
donated no one will make any complaint:
it will simply mean either that more
nev/sbovs will be fed or that the news
boy! will be fed more. The good thing!
will be used no matter how much Is sent
in. Solicitors have been provided with
written credentials and volunteer badges
in order to protect the generously in
clined against "grafters"' who mlK'it
trade upon the willingness of the general
public to donate to so worthy an object.

A week ago the foothaJl prospects for â¢
the winter were bright and cheerful, but j
row a cold frost has killed them In the j
bud. For a time It looked as If there [
would certHinly be a game here between
the victorious California ... and the ;
great team from The Chicago University. '
To enlivTn the Interest in the gridiron j
*port the football manager of California ',
Bt.nounr.-<1 that he would bring the Car- j
â ,isl<- Indians to the coast. This meant
football galore.

The opposition came from a quarter
thnt wa> lÂ«-ast expected. It was not
drftmeJ for h moment that the players
on 'he blue and gold team would show
aversion to a match with the Chicago
eleven, but this Is what prevented the
biggest football contest so far known to
lhÂ«- coast. Thf university men thought
they had worked lons and hard enough
during the season Just passed to earn a
rest. Knowing that they would have to
train rigidly if they Intended to uift the
champions of the Middl<- West rebellion
started in thÂ«Â» ranks ami the recalcitrant
members ahwolutely refused to don the
canvas jacket again this season.
Manager Berry was then approached,
but met with a similar quantum of suc
cÂ« as in his efforts to haw his team meet
the Chlragoans or the Indians. The Stan
ford team dr.es not wajil to play agtttn
this year. The latest solution proposed
Is to form a picked team from the col
leges and the Olympics to mÂ«vt the In
dians or the Chlcacoans. but this Is mere
ly a hUÃgÂ«stion made by some sport pro
moters.
ThÂ«- faculty athletic committees of the
two colleges are jiKain at work, this time
with recommendations that will material
ly change the status of things. The aboli
tion of 'foreign <-oa<-hlng is not likely to
he carried into tftVot. as the spirit of the
undent body is against It. The
contentions of the students are
founded on work actually accom
plished by Eastern coaches. That
the game on this coast Is not up to the
Eastern standard there can be no ques
tion. What Cochran and Kelly have done
for the California team in the last year
may be tak<n as an example of what
rnlpht be done again. Without th.-se
coaches the samo would decline in quali
ty instead of advancing.
At the Sixteenth and Folsom- street
fxounds this afternoon the Centerville
ilgh School and the monta will play
for the championship of the Academic
Athletic League. Both elevens are even
ly matched Â«nd th<Â« game will draw a
large attendance of adherents of both
f<ehool>Â«. During the week Al. Lean was
at Bclmont training the team. On Tues
day Prlngle was there coaching, on
Wednesday Womble nnd Moore and on
Thursday McNah and Dibble. The pre
paratory BChOOI players have shown the
fastest and bÂ«st games of the year and
the contest to-day is expected to prove
an exciting one.

WOULD LIMIT THE
SHOOTING OF QUAIL
ABOUT POINT REYES
Efforts Being Made to Preserve the
Country Where the Best
Sport Is Enjoyed.
The country about Point Reyes has af
forded this season the best quail shooting
of any place within easy reach of this
city. Sportsmen have shot over Its hills
and canyons freely. Conditions may be
different shortly, as a movement la on
foot to preserve the major portion of the
ground and thus limit, in a degree. Its
use. The proprietor of the Point Reyes
Hotel and a prominent Run club are re
puted to be in the field for the privilege.
Representatives of the gun club deny
any desire on their part to get the exclu
sive shooting. If the hotel man secures
It he will probably charge a small fee.
At present the farmers exact a fee. of fif
ty cents from persons shooting over their
land. They are business-like in their col
lections and BO man with a gun escapes.
It Is said to average 51.50 a day for a
gunner, as he usually covers considera
ble ground and parses from one farm to
another.
Point Reyes Is adapted to the Increase
of quail sis ihcre are many inaccessible
places where the birds are free from mo
lestation. A w.-11-known gunman says the
only manner in which they can ever be
wlpt-d out is by trapping. In this way
whole bevies may be disposed of. With
shooting this is not possible, as some
birds are sure to make their escape.
The Country Club members an* await
ing a spell of dry weather before they try
for quail again on their Marin <'ounty
preserve. The ground is still wet and the
birds refuse to lie. I'pon ing Hushed
they run and scatter before the sports
men have a chance at them. Just when
good shooting is expected rains come and
si>oll the ground.
The black brant, one of the most dim
cult of game birds to kill, are In Tomales
Bay in great numbers. They are mem
bers of the goose family and sportsmen
pronounce them more delicately flavored
than canvasbacks. A party listing
of W. H. Keller of Santa Monica. F. C.
Sanborn and Al. Wilson went after the
birds on Wednesday. They secured thirty,
although the conditions were all against
good spcrt. It was raining and a heavy
wind was blowing.
Mr. Jospolyn. of the Tide Belle Club
killed sixty-five ducks, "cans" and sprig
hist Sunday. This is an unusually good
bag. Thomas McCord recured twelve of
which four were "cans." Alex. Hamilton
shot over the preserve Wednesday and
enjoyed good sport.
Fred. Johnson. Newton Hickman. "Bil
ly hwaln and Bert. Patrick shot over the
Blark Jack Club's preserve. Sherman Isl
and, last Sunday. After they had secured
twenty-five birds a heavy fiver fog set
tled down upon the ponds and brought
what promised to be good sport to an ab
rupt end. ThÂ«- fog was so thick that It
Obscured the decoys.
Leon Carrau shot on Ban Pablo marsh
last Sunday, but found It a blank as did
other sportsmen who tried the sport
Within sight of th.-m a market hunter
secured over a hundred birds. The blind
from which he shot seemed to have an
irresistible attraction for the ducks and
he bagged all that came within reach of
his deadly ten-bore. Persons who thought
1., was trapping the ducks watched his
.work closely and did not see him employ
such Illegitimate means of securing a. big
ha g.
W. D. Mr Arthur was the most success
ful of the Olympic Gun Club members on
the Cordelia preserve last Sunday. He
eecured twenty birds, shooting over a new
pond formed by the overflow. Experts of
the club take this as an intimation that
the. ducks prefer to feed on the over
flowed lands rather than on th.- made
ponds. This may account for the small
number of birds seen on the halted ponds
while the overflowed territory covers so
great an area.
On Wednesday Harry B. Hosmer H J.
Wicker. E. W. Brings and Frank Maskey
shot over the preserve with moderate
success. Dr. <;. W. Klelser and W. F.
Foster will be In the field to-morrow.
They are undecided as to whether th.
shall try for ducks or quail.
A. A. Borllnl. prominent among the gun
club men. was married to Miss Margaret
Olcese Thursday night. The young couple
went south on thÂ«Â«ir honeymoon trip.
At the last meeting of Empire Gun Club

about thirty quail in Redwood Canyon,
near Haywards. last Sunday. The quail
are quite numerous, but the wildcats are
gradually disappearing, owing to the con
tinual warfare kept up against them. Mr.
Fischer and friends who hunt with him
have a record of killing some two hun
dred and fifty of the animals In an ex
perience covering many years.
McPhillips and PUmmer secured the
best bag of the season at Newark last
Sunday. They bagged thirty birds, sprig,
widgeon and blue bills. On Wednesday a
man secured a bag of fifteen, chiefly can
vasbacks. at the hridces.
AROUND THE YAIHT CLUBS.
Though most of the yachts are securely
laid up In winter quarters, a few will be
In commission all the winter. Among
these la Dr. A. \V. McKenzle's sloop
Sappho, which will be taken up on the
ways at Old Saucaltto us soon as the
Naiad comes off for calking and a gen
eral overhauling. Commodore T. L. Hill's
â loop Cyjmus It lying In Larkspur Creek,
having been stripped of spars. sails and

set of ways will be built on the shore
alongside Jhe present set. Several changes
will take place next season at the San
Francisco Yacht Club Dr. T. L. Hill,
having held the office of commodore for
two years, will riot geek re-election. Dr.
V. P. Buck â¢ the vice commodore, will
fell the schooner Outing, and bo will not
be a candidate for the command of the
fleet, and It Is likely that a new man will
be chosen as treasurer. James Kitter
man li suggested for commodore. E. C.
Hartlett will probably continue as re
cording secretary, W. G. Morrow as finan
cial secretary and It. B. Hogue as treas
urer. \v. G. Morrow is at present on a
trip to New York. If merman Is chosen
as commodore the office of port captain
will he vacant. J. S. Cockerfll, who was
a member of the crew that sailed the
Gadder to victory, is looking about for a
yacht, and will certainly become an owner
next season. Q. T. 8. White sold his
sloop Will o' the Wisp at the close of the
season. Ex-Commodore W. N. m.--
Carthy, who handled the Gadder's tiller
In the perpetual challenge cup race, would
be a popular and excellent commodore, be

Brond and Minify, who sailed last season
with Archie Sutherland on the sloop
Catherine, will buy or charter a yacht.
E. C Bartlett, secretary of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, has returned to his
work after â  month Illness. His yawl
Frolic is anchored In Bulsun Creek, where
she Is being usÂ«>d as a houseboat.
The ladles' society at Sausallto named
Las Amigas has taken the upper rooms
â¢if the San Francisco Club house. The
danceroom has been arranged for the
game of basket-ball, and the reading room
provided with periodicals and decorated
with rugs and flowers. Meetings are held
every week, and the club Is supporting a

The last issu* of the Western Golfer,
published by Arnold A Guinea of Chicago,
Is entitled "California Number." and con
tains a full and Interesting account of
the various links In the State, to which
T. H. Arnold recently paid an extended
visit. He says the game Is young and
experienced golfers are few In California,
and that there are scarcely any turfed
greens, but that the courses offer novelty
and variety and that the players are not
conceited but are ready to accept hints
from their Eastern brethren. The course
at Adams Point comes In for high praise
as "by great odds the most attractive
course In the entire State" and "a nearer
approach to some of the very attractive
Kastern courses than anything In the far
West." The San Rafael course gets a few
(a very few) words of kindly mention, but
the Presidio course Is harshly handled,
being described as "rough, unkempt and
badly laid out, the prettiest and most In
viting portion being left unused." and "an
absolute libel on the name of golf links."
The critic says "the greens are as rough
as the rubbing surface of a washboard,
the ground Is full of holes and In some
places there are tremendous cracks Into
which the hand can be thrust edgewise."
The state of the teeing grounds and the
manner In which the greens have been
treated come in for strong condemnation.
It Is admitted that D. Stephonson. the
club professional. Is a "master of the
game and a thorough golfer In spirit." hut
the course is said to be "a source of deep
mortification to him The only grain of
comfort for the Presidio golfers Is to be
found In Mr. Arnold's -merit that
"there is an opportunity there for an ex
cellent course.'
TO DLVtLOP CYCLE RACING.
Manager M-Farland is planning an
other big cycle meet for Pan Jose, to be
h.-ld <m, th<> I'nth inst.. In connection with
the Jubilee celebration there at that time.
He Is endeavoring to get some of the
cracks now at Los AnKMps to attend, in
cluding I.acey. Furman and one or twr>
others, if they come he contemplates
holding a DM -t In this city and one at
Bacramento. McParland is doing a good
deal for the sport in this part of the
State.
Together with McFarland's efforts In
and abOUl San J<<so. Leavitt & Bill of this
city are doing all they can to stimulate
Interest in the racing game. They have
already held thre.- mÂ»ets at the Olympic
tra'-k, at which all the prizes w<-rÂ«- >'.'<
nated by them and no fee was charged
at the pate. If the riders fall to Â
1 late BUCh efforts as these in their be
half they are. indeed, ungrateful.
A n> w club has been organised aT Sono
ma with the fallowing officers: it
dent. William C. Stevens; treasurer, s.
Glaister; secretary, i;-rr jon^s; captain,
Stephen Akers.
In all probability there will be no In
door meet here this winter. Brady â 
> who conducted the six-lay and Other
events at the Pavilion last March, do not
intend to come out here again, as they
lost too much money last time, and no
In. al financier spurt seems incline) to
undertake th- proposition. The Olympic
Wheelmen may conduct a meet on their
track In February, however, but It will
t.. a daytime affair.
At the regular monthly meeting of the
Olympic Wheelmen. t.> i"- held next Tues
:uht. a committee will be appointed
to name the oflcets "T the club for !.â¢ xt
year.
EXHIBITION BY ATHLETES.
On New Years day the Young Men's
Christian Association gymnasts will en

Much interest Is manifested In the In

matches between the city and the Oak
land branches. Two weeks ago the
Athens defeated the Rushers In this city
by a score of 24-20. after a hard fought
game. The same teams met last night
in. Oakland in a return match. Last Fri
day night the Missions, surprised their

MORE MOBS.
SCARCELY had the President's message, deal
ing at length with the prevalence of mob law,
been delivered when the mob outbreak at
Maysville, Ky., occurred. It was attended by the
singularly revolting features which have recently
characterized these outbreaks. The negro was burned
it the stake, in the presence of thousands unmasked.
Hi* teeth and bones were eagerly scrambled f6r as
r-ouvenirs, and when the fire declined school chil
dren, as young as mx years, were seen poking the
fr.-ikrments into the coals and adding more fuel and
dry grass to the flames. The victim's crime was un
speakable, and one may treat of the punishment with
no feeling of pity for him. But what must be the
final eiVect of such general participation by people of
ill ages, in an abandonment of passion, that inflicts
fuch a punishment even upon a brute, to say noth
ing of a human being? There have been crimes as
revolting as the negro's committed in this city. In
deed it may be admitted that the church murders,
which were expiated on the gallows at San Quentin,
uere more horrible. But those murders were satisfac
torily punched by the law, and even its vexatious de
lays were patiently endured by a community that felt
in every fiber the full enormity and guilt of the mur
derer.
In civilized society vengeance is the function of
the law, not the right of the individual. The crime
for which the Maysville negro was dragged and
slashed and burned is not made less frequent by these
lynching It is a grievous error to mime that any
one is safer apainst a similar offense because this
shrieking wretch has been chained to a tree and
burned by a slow fire. The experience of modern
peoples is that where law is instituted the very best
rrotcction comes of its orderly administration. Life
and person are safest to-day in the United States
litre there is the promptest submission to the law.
They arc the least safe where the law is most fre
quently violated by lynching and the infliction of
mob violence. Thr more frequent such occurrences
become the more frequent are the crimes which they
punish by such ghastly vengeance. Every woman in
the South should join her voice to those who cry out
for the punishment of criminals by the law. That is
the only road to such safety II is enjoyed in the law
abiding sections of the country.
It is hard to make lynching communities under
stand that their violence encourages the crimes it is
intended to punish and prevent. The scoundrel who
cherishes an evil purpose and waits for a time to
achieve it is sure to reason away what scruples thee
may be in his brutal intellect by the constant reflec
tion that everybody who takes part in a lynching is
a violator of hw. therefore why may not he violate it?
In all criminals there is after all a subtle psychological
process which sets up justification to quiet the con
science which is in all men. A mob furnishes the
material for use by the criminal mind, and so we have
these appalling lynching* followed by repetition of
the very crimes they are supposed to prevent.
The only remedy for violation of the law is to re
spect the law. Where a majority ft community
lives in righteous regard for the law transgressions
are less, and less heinous, than where such majority
itself breaks the law in the barbaric outbursts of
unrestrained passion.

AN EXTRA SESSION.
READERS of The Call have recently been made
familiar with our view that the Legislature only
can satisfactorily adjust the Senatorial fcituatfon
c the strength of the Republican party
unimpaired for 1900.
re no oi,e need be surprised that we con
nith philosophy an extra session of that
elie; that it will make such adjustment.
We feel no rancor in laying that the only shadow
upon the party's future has been the candidacy ol
:c! Burn.-. [{ he had declared himself, as Gram
a candidate in 1898 and had gone before the
> a<; frankly, and won. we might have silently
deprecated the popular choice as a mistake, but we
would have refrained from drastic criticism of that
choice. As lie did not do this, his Candidacy stands
vist where it did upon its avowal after the Legis
lature was elected.
The fate of the party in California next year Is
still bound up in the selection of a Senator. We are
still of the opinion that the choice of Colonel Burns
will decide that fate adversely to party success in
1900.
AH men have seen the tendency of party sentiment
in this city. It is toward a greater independence of
action than ever before. It is in the direction of re
buking impropriety in the ads of party manages
and leaders. We have had no doubt whatever that
if Governor Gage appointed Burns he would put
the knife into the vitals of the party. We applaud
his decision to refrain from such slaughter. He has
decided wisely. Now let the Legislature be as wise.
No one will be found to dispute the proposition that
if it elect Colonel Burns the party will go into the
Presidential campaign handicapped beyond the
probability of carrying this State. No friend of
Colonel Burns whose advice is worth giving or
taking will dispute this. All men will admit that
our purpose has been only to preserve for the party
the *trenerth that came to it out of its conspicuous
victory in 1898. The necessities of the situation, the
perils which were on every hand during the reeular
sc^ion, compelled a drastic and at times a seemingly
harÂ«h presentation of this view, but it was in an
emergency that left no time for a selection of phrases.
The Legislature comes together now with th;
situation spread before it like a map. Every member
knows his duly and is advised of the interests at
stake. A Senator is to be chosen. The party has a
wealth of well-seasoned material. A choice may easfly
be made that will not only command party approval
but the commendation of the whole State. The Call
has no candidate, and has never had any. When the
proper man appears in the balloting he will have our
support Thiv paper has no individual purpose to he
forwarded by a Senator, no interests that require his
support beyond tho<;e which are general and common
to the whole State.
It iv devoted to but one purpose and that is the
success of the Republican party and its broad prin
ciples We feel with preat sincerity that ever)- selec
tion made by the party to an important place affect I
the pr>ny'<; Mrenrth. usefully or harmfnlly, according
as it â  - â¢ ... Âe r
We deny that the party is at all lacking in trained
material and rejected personalities. Such are nu
merous in it< ranks. To therm we invite the atten
tion of the Legislature, and from the midst of them
we confidently believe a proper choice will be made.
We â¢ â¢ :>-sue a course of watchful wisdom
the steps which precede and accompany the
â Ture. Improper motives in any
individual will be observed and reprobated with un
rfinnni-hed vipor. But we also expect and believe
that the wi<:e and loyal Republicans in that body will
take the direction of matters in their own hands and
that its action when completed will command the re
spect and receive the indorsement of the whole State.

A COLOMBIAN LOflN.
O CCORDING to a recent report the Govern
/ \ ment of the republic of Columbia has been so
deeply impressed by the success which at
tended the so-called "popular loan" in the United
I at the outbreak of the Spanish war that, hav
ing neÂ«d of money, it determined to follow the ex
ample. It appears, however, that the people of Co
lombia were not so much impressed as the Govern
ment, and have not responded as promptly as they
1 have done. The Government has thereupon
followed the issue of the popular loan with notice
that if it be not subscribed within a given time the
army will collect it by force.
A popular loan of that character may in the end
be just as effective as that which our Government
carried so triumphantly through. It will doubtless
bring into the public treasury the money needed, and
will therefore serve the main purpose for which a loan
i* intended. The difference in the method of apply
ing it. however, is so great it will hardly escape the
attention even of those who are most indifferent to
such matter*.
The nearer approach we have ever had in this
country to such governmental dealings with finance
was the nomination of a candidate for the Presidency
on a platform which virtually said to the creditors of
the Government that if they would accept the payment
of their bonds at fifty cents on the dollar well and
good. but. if not. the Government would force them
it by the remonetization of silver and the pay
ment of all debt! on the silver basis. Mr. Bryan was
not elected, and our Government, therefore, has not
set Colombia r.n example in the course she is follow
ing. If she per-ists in that cour>e, however, and
wisheÂ« a ie.tder from this country, we are willing to
give her Mr. Bryan. In his politics it is doubtless as
permissible to force a loan a* it is to force a settle
ment of a gold obligation in depreciated silver.

SOME QUESTIONS OF INSURANCE.
OUR Eastern contemporaries arc Riving much
attention t<Â» :i recent decision of iW Sn
Court of Pennsylvania that a severe cold is
80l â  disease, and even if the man with the cold \,c
bÂ«*i/ie is nevertheless in good health.
The question arose in a case in which an insurance
company endeavored to evade the payment of a
policy taken out by a man who had at the time a cold
which afterward developed into an attack of pneu
monia from which he died. The Eastern people ap
:o be well pleased with the decision of the
court, for in the climate of that section of the Union
are so common that if they be accounted dis
eases hardly any citizen could consider himself
THE SAX FRANCTSCO CALL. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 0. 1899.
healthy within the meaning of the language of a life
insurance policy.
The W estminister Gazette in a recent issue reported
a still more curious insurance question which has
come before the courts of Vienna. It appears that a
surgeon while trimming his finger-nails cut his finger
slightly, and in making a dissection shortly afterward
became subject to blood-poisoning, from which he
died. The insurance company declined to pay the
policy on the ground that its terms expressly ex
cluded liability for anything that might result to a
surgeon performing an operation upon himself. The
plaintiffs insisted that the trimming of finger-nails is
not a surgical operation, and a lawsuit is the con
sequence. The question appears to be a puzzling one
to Austrian Judges, for they have had it under ad
visement for some time and have not yet decided it.
In connection with the Vienna controversy our
London contemporary cites a decision of a Berlin
court on an insurance case which is in some respects
similar to the one just decided in Pennsylvania. A
citizen of Berlin who was badly afflicted with corns
was unable to move quickly enough to get out of the
way of a runaway and was killed. The insurance
men claimed that as he had corns he was not in good
health at the time of the insurance and the policy
should be declared void. The court refused to sanc
tion any such doctrine, and accordingly by legal in
terpretation corns do not constitute a disease.
These various cases are not in themselves impor
tant or even interesting except in so far as they offer
an answer to the old question, "Who shall decide
when doctors disagree?" The Judges have assumed
a right to decide, and if their decisions do not satisfy
insurance men or physicians they are at least pleasing
to the public. It would indeed be a bad world if
corns and colds were diseases and trimming nails a
surgical operation.
An Oakland minister has satisfied himself that
snakes were created before men. He is probably
willing to admit, however, that some men have added,
under certain conditions, to the very disagreeable
supply.
SOME PERPLEXING QUESTIONS.
SIXCE Secretary Alger was forced to retire partly
by popular clamor and partly by the odor cf
embalmed beef the War Department has had no
such agitation as that which has shaken it over the
summary dismissal of Noble E. Dawson from its
service. The offense for which Mr. Dawson has
paid by the loss of his position was that of writing to
the Postmaster General a letter which, while showing
a commendable desire to have certain postal questions
settled, was not so commendable (or tone and style.
This letter, which, be it remembered, was sent
from a subordinate official in the War Department to
the august head of the Postoffice Department, ran
thus: -I trust that when the wise and patriotic ad
ministration gets back from its swing-around cam
paign, having shown the bucolic voter that it was
McKinley who caused the bountiful crops to grow,
salted the Klondike with a wealth of golden nuggets
and furnished employment (in the Philippines) to
our unoccupied needy, you will, undaunted by the
specter so aptly limned by the autumnal poet in his
luminous phrase, 'The Dewey-skirted clouds imbibe
the sun." again tackle the colonial postage matter."
Undoubtedly such a letter was highly improper.
Even a person holding the safe position of a private
citizen has no right to address a Postmaster General
in such term*, and from a Government employe it
was something like treason. Mr. Dawson, therefore,
well merited the punishment which retires him from
the attractions and emoluments of official employment
at Washington back to his former home in lowa,
where he wiil find frosts and flying snow to welcome
his return. Nevertheless he was quite right in pressing
for a settlement of colonial postage matters. It i<
high time for the Government to decide upon the
way in which our relations with our new possessions
ire to be maintained. Postal matters are but a small
part of these questions, and in one way or another
they affect large interests and ought to be promptly
determined.
We have as yet provided no definite form of gov
ernment even for Hawaii, and it will b e remembered
, that a short time ago in cases arising under the con
tract labor laws of the islands it was decided by the
courts there that the constitution of the United States
is not the paramount law in Hawaii. Not long ago a
controversy urosc between the Treasury Department
and the War Department over the position which
I'orto Rico occupies under our Government, and
similar conflicts of authority have occurred in Cuba.
In his message the President has referred all of
these issues to Congress for settlement, and the at
tention of the two houses should be given to them
ris soon as business begins. There ought to be no
long delay in determining what are to be our postal
and tariff relations with the islands and also whether
the constitution of the United States prevail there
or not. Dawson's mode of making his suggestion to
the Postmaster General was too poetic to be toler
ated, but the suggestion itself wns all right, and be
fore the "Dewey skirted clouds imbibe too many
suns" the questions -h-mld be settled.
Fitzsimmons seems to have aroused the ire of
pugilistic authorities by violating one of the primary
principles of his profession. In a recent argument he

COMMERCIAL MUSEUm'bENEFITS.
KP~\EPORTS from Philadelphia concerning the
work of the Commercial Museum in that city
are of a nature to stimulate the promoters of
the movement to establish a similar museum here and
to furnish them with arguments to induce merchants
and citizens generally to give the project a liberal
rapport
In a recent review of the work of the Philadelphia
1 Museum for a tingle week the Record stated that the
Officials had received letters of inquiry concerning
trade matters and markets for particular lines of
goods from sixty domestic aud sixty-six foreign
correspondents. By way of showing the range
:of foreign inquiry covered by the museum it was
pointed out that tliesc letters of the week represented
inquiries from Africa, Australia. Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Dominica, Egypt, England!
France, Germany, Hayti. Holland, Hungary, India!
Italy, Martinique, Mexico, Norway, Palestine, Peru!
Porto Rico. Russia, Sicily, Singapore, South Africa,'
Switzerland and Turkey.
It is stated that while the war with Spain adver
tised thÂ« United States and made known our great
ness as a nation, thereby attracting to us the attention
of traders in all countries, the information concerning
our Industrie* and our markets has been given more
b] the Philadelphia Museum than any other single
factor in the country. Merchants and manufacturers
in all parts of the world are now resorting to it fo.
informattOO, and its benefits are everywhere recog
nized. A similar museum on this coast would be ai
r.iost as beneficial as that in Philadelphia, and it is to
be hoped it will not be long before one is provided
and adequately maintained.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1899.
OVERDUE FLEET
IS NEARLY ALL
ACCOUNTED FOR
Four More Vessels
Make Port.
ANTELOPE HAD A HARD TIME
WATER BEGAN TO RTJN SHORT
OVER TWO wri'ira AGO.
After battling with the southeaster for
over a month and a half the schooners S.
Danielson and Antelope finally made- port
yesterday. Shortly afterward they were
followed in by the barkentine Leslie O.
twenty-nine days from Tacoma. The An
telope was bound for Santa Monica, but
as there was only two days' supply of
water aboard and the rudder was dam
aged Captain Anderson thought It better
to come Into this port and make the neces
sary repair* and nil his water tanks.
The Antelope left the Coqullle River on
October IS In company with the schooners
Lizzie Pre!n, Parkersburg, Joseph and
Henry. Volante and Eureka, All of these
vessels have been to San Francisco, tils
charged, loaded again, made the run back
to Coqullle and are once more on tiieir
way to this port, while the Antelope has
been battling with the elements. In fact,
the Volante on her second trip la among
the oveniues and was supplied with pro
visions off Cape Foulweatber on Decem
ber 1 by tha steamer Grace Dollar.
Captain Brown of the Antelope says
that In the past twenty years he cannot
remember such a succession of south
easterly storms. It would blow a hurri
cane for four days and then by the time
the sea would go down and a little sail
could be carried It would come up again
and blow another southeaster. On Novem
ber 20, after the schooner had been bat
tling with the elements for thlrty-ni.ie
days. Captain Anderson found himself 150
miles southeast of Flattery. The little
schooner was laboring heavily and ttie
deckload darted. Before the lashings
could be made fast aealn 15,(00 feet of
lumber went by the board. The Antelope
was now away north of the starting point
and when the rudder was lound to be
damaged the crew came to the conclusion
that they were in a bad box. They had
plenty or provisions, but little water, and
that had to be used very sparingly.
Everybody was put on short allowance,
with the result that there was a scant
two days' supply aboard when the
schooner made port. Tho Antelope will
discharge and repair here and will then,
go to Coquille for another load.
There were plenty of water and pro
visions on the S. Panic's. in when she
reached port yesterday. On November 14
â ha was spoken by tho steamer Umatilla
cr.d was given enough food and water
to last thirty days. All the men were fat
and hearty yesterday, but disgusted with
their long trip. Captain Crangle says that
for thirty days there was never more than
four hours at a time that he could carry
sail. At the end of that time he was in
the same predicament as the Antelope,
being far north of his starting point.
Nevertheless, during the entire passage
not a fail was lost nor a rope parted.
The barkentine Leslie D. from Port
Blakeley, and the schooner Mayflower,
from CoQuille. report a succession of
southeast gales lasting for twenty-two
clays, during which time no progress could
be made. Thesa arrivals account for
nearly all of the overdue fleet. Nothing
has been heard from the schooner An.
ican Girl, which left here October s lor
Puget Sound, nor from the schooner Wing
and Wing, now out thirty-four days from
Grays Harbor, sine- sho was spoken by
the revenue cutter McCulloch. On that
occasion the crew of the schooner had
been living on seagulls for four days.
There Is considerable speculation in the
Naval Battalion as to who will be elect-
M to succeed Captain Louis H. Turner.
The latter, owing to his private business,
has been compelled to sever his connection
with the militia, and a successor to nlm Is
to be elected on December 16. All the cf
rtcers from Eureka. Santa Cruz, Sarta
Barbara and San Pedro will be present
aboard the Marion and they will elect a
new captain for the Naval Reserve. The
most prominent candidate for the position
I? N. T. James, marine surveyor for the
Frankfort Marine Insurance Company.
Mr. James is a graduate of Annapolis
and was at one time inspector general of
tho National Guard.
Captain C. C. Dennis, who has com
manded thÂ« First Division of the Naval
Reserves for many years, also retires at
the end of the month and his successor
has also to bo elected.
LADY PLACE HUNTERS
NOW WORRY BERGEROT
FEARS A TZACHEH MAY GET
THE OFFICE HE COVETS.
He Demands That the Pedagogues
Take a Stand on One Side or
the Other.
P. A. Borperot. president of the School
Board nr.d candidate for membership in
the next, wants to know if It is true that
a majority of the teachers In the depart
ment favor the proposition to have Mayor
Phelan appoint women to two of the four
memberships of tho new organizatiwn. To
lind out to h!s own satisfaction he has
started a â natle canvass of thÂ« de
partment and has ordered the teacher* to
declare themselves on one side or the
other. The candidacy of Bergerot fot a
Job under i'helan rule has been known
and talked of among his fellow-members
for three months paÃt. Although he never
made otlicial announcement of it the radi
cal change* in his attitude toward the
administration which waa noted at the
middle of the term was suinclent evidence
cf his expectations. During the last cam
paign he tucceeded In making the Mayor
prominent in a number of vital school
matters which, strange to say, wero
brought up In a bunch at that most op
portune time, and It has been thought
lately that his eventual appointment WiÂ»a
a â¢"cinch."
Two weeks ago. however, a protest went
up from come of the most prominent
women teachers In the department. They
discovered that there was nothing In the
charter to prevent the Mayor giving rep
resentation to women on the new jourd
and they declared themselves In favor of
such action. With two of the astute ladies
of the department looking for Jobs Uer
gerot's chances of appointment have been
cut in half and he Is out now to discover
If the ladies really mean what they say
To do this he yesterday mailed to every
teacher in the city's employ a postal caid
with the following statement printed on
Its face:
SAN FRANCISCO. !><;. Â«. lgW.
Dear Madam: The proposition has been freely
advanced that, given a mal* director and a fe
male director 01 equal ability, honesty and In
tegrity, the lady teacher* of the School Depart
ment would prefer to tee the male director
chosen to administer the affairs of thÂ« de
rartment.
As I desire to ascertain the sense of all the
lady teachers In the department upon thla ques
tion, you would oblige me very much by
answorliis the following Interrogations and
mailing the same back to me forthwith Very
truly yours. P. A. BKncnnOT. President.
On tho back of a reply card, upon whih
President Berperot thoughtfully prepaid
postage, was the following catechism:
BOARD OF EDUCATION.
(Answer Tea or No.)
Iâ Are you In favor of the appointment of a
female director on the new Beard of Educa
tion?
:â Do you prefer to have the Board of Educa

tor of equal ability, honesty and Integrity
would you advocate tbs appointment of the

4â lf you have no preference please state It.

has learned if he has two chances or only
; one for his much-sought Job. A few days

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A FAIR WIND.
THE long overdue schooner Amethyst made port Thursday, after a pas
sage of 50 days from Tlllamook. For 45 days she had a succession of
southeast gales to contend with and was 27 days making SO miles. Bhe
was supplied with provisions by tho transport Columbia, so the crew of
five all told did not suffer much, except from the wearying nature of the
voyage.
ACCUSES DEB
EMPLOYER OF
BEATING HER
Aged Mrs. Caelif in a
Serious Condition.
HER LIFE IN THE -BALANCE
CHARGES MRS. GALLAGH
WITH ASSAULTING HER.
Mrs. Caellf, an elderly woman, lies in
a precarious condition at St. Mary's Hos
plta.l. the result, she says, of being beaten
ly Mrs. Gallagher, the wife of Attorney
Walter Gallagher. Assistant District At
torney Salomon has Interested himself in
the case, and It Is not unlikely that Mrs.
Gallagher will have to answer for the
seemingly unprovoked assault.
According to Mrs. Caellf's statement,
which is In the hands of the police, she
advertised for a position In some respect
able family, expecting to do light house
work for her board. Mrs. Gallagher an
swered the advertisement, and after a
short conversation with her alleged
victim, she readily consented to employ
her. Only a few days later. Mrs. Caellf
alleges. Mrs. Gallagher rushed Into the
room occupied by the old woman, and af
ter declaring her Intention of nailing the
windows and doors so as to prevent her
husband from entering, produced a
hammer and a paper of tacks. Mrs.
Caellf tried to dissuade her from her pur
pose, when the Infuriated woman seized
her by the hair and dragged her out of
bed. Mrs. Caellf says that she suddenly
became unconscious, and when she awak
ened some time afterward she found her
face and hands bathed in blood that
flowed from an ugly wound In the head.
Her thigh was broken, presumedly from
falling to the floor, and unable to move,
she screamed for help.
A young man who was in the- house at
the timÂ» went to her assistance and after
considerable trouble placed her back in
bed. He then washed the blood off her
face and hands and promised to see that
she was not further molested by Mrs.
Gallagher.
A few minutes later Mrs. Gallagher
again entered the room, so Mrs. Caelif
alleges, and seizing her helpless victim
started to assault her with her lists. After
beating her into a state bordering on in
sensibility Mrs. Gallagher left the room
and went to her own apartments.
The following day Mrs. Caellf managed
to get a letter to Mrs. J. J. Woolner of
141 Hancock street, in which she told her
of tho assault committed on her by her
employer and pegged hereto call on her.
After visiting the bedside of the unfortu
nate woman and learning that her con
dition was serious Mrs. Woolner had her
removed to St. Mary's Hospital. Subse
quently Mrs. Woolner had her brother, go
to police headquarters and report the oc
currence to ('iÂ»Â»ef Lees. The latter sent
Sergeant Colby and Policeman Hoyneman
to the hospital to get a statement from
Mrs. Caelif. After she had told how Mrs.
Gallagher had assaulted her she was asked
If she wanted her arrested. The Injured
woman replied In tho negative, but asked
that she be compelled to pay her ex
penses in the hospital. Mrs. Gallagher's
husband agreed to take care of Mrs.
Caelif until she recovered, but he has
thus far signally failed to keep his
promise.
The unfortunate woman is still suffering
from the effects of the beating which she
claims she received at the hands of Mrs.
Gallagher, and on account of her ad
vanced years it Is doubtful If she ever
recovers.
When seen last night Mrs. Gallagher at
first denied that she knew Mrs. Caellf.
but finally admitted that she had at one
time employed a woman answering her
description as a servant. She emphati
cally denied that she had assaulted her
and referred the reporter to her husband
for corroboration.
Assistant District Attorney Salomon in
tends in the next few days to call the at
tention of the Grand Jury to the assault.
An effort will then be made to have Mrs.
Gallagher Indicted.

SEVERELY BITTEN BY
A WATER-FRONT MULE
OAKLAND Doc. S.â William Corday.
:in Alamcda teÂ«mster, aged Z'J years, had
the vÂ«ry novel experience on the Oakland
water front this afternoon of being
Severely bitten by a vicious mule. Conlay
was quietly walking about the water
front and had Just passed the leng-eared
animal when he was suddenly .'.-,1 by
the right arm and lifted on the ground
His horror when he Identified his assaill
unt can eai.ly be surmised. After a con
siderable struggle Corda>- succeeded In
K'-ouring his release. Exhausted from
ir^in nnd loss of blood, Corday yet has
tened to the Receiving Hospital, where
Steward Bouchert dressed an ugly lac
erated wound on the bleep of the right
i arm which required nearly a dosÂ«-n
i ftitoh's. "I have had experiences with
vicious dogs." said Corday afterward
, "but surely this one was no horso on me'
I certainly thought I had been called to
my doom, for 1 had not noticed the ani-
I maJ as 1 passed, and tho sudden Jerk
with which I was lifted into the air
knocked me Billy. Indeed It was a mule on
me. 1

THE BIG BALDWIN SALE
â Â«
NO INDICATIONS OF FLURRY ',
IN TRANSACTIONS.
THE mlÂ« of the Baldwin Hotel site
for J .423.000 by E. .1. Baldwin to
James I. Flood was the sole trans
action of moment In the real es
tate mar; during the past wceli. j
but that of Itself was sufficient to cause
a feeling of relief and gratification. Mr.
Ficon will crrrt on tlie property a mag.
r.lP.cent building Vti&t will be an a<!;rn- j
nient to the city and a credit to â¢â  > j':d&- j
mmt. and the unsightly heap of ruins j
that threatened to fllFflgrure one of the j
most desirable corners in the city for
months, if not for years, to come will |
soon be obliterated.
To any one who has any doubt v.hat- â 
ever as to the healthy condition of the !
real estate market, the figures represent- |
Ing the value of the property transferred j
during the last thirty days should he j
sufficient to reassure him. The -ales for j
that period agcr<j;atc- J1.45! ,4<"! for inside ;
properties alone, and although there have I
been no Indications of a flurry in the ,
market, the price* obtained have been j
fair almost without exception. Not only i
have the sales actually recorded reached '
this more than satisfactory figure, but I
fully half a million dollars' worth of prop- ,
erty changed hands during the last thirty
days of which no record has as yet been ;
made. In view of this fact and the nu- j
merous inquiries for desirable Investment j
property, with which all the brokers are <
br sieged, and the additional fact that a
number of big deals are on the very verge j
of being consummated, the property own- j
ers of San Francisco have every reason '
to feel satisfied with existing conditions. !
The Investment of capital Is not confined j
to any particular district, although the i
wholesale district Is receiving the most !
attention, as Is but natural under the j
circumstances. Buyers seem to be will- j
Ing to invest In any portion of the city '
where Income producing property can be
found.
There is a large surplus of money on
hand In all the savings banks, and the
; difilculty of placing this accumulation of
wealth has â¢ pin to prove rather a mat
ter of inconvenience, even though It does
furnish convincing proof of the general
; prosperity of the Â«-eople. According to
Thomas Mage*> .t Sons 1 Real Estate Cir
cular the savings banks are reducing
: their balances, some by the purchase of
Government bonds and others by satis
factory loans on the best of stock and
1 bond securities. Continuing the "Circu
lar" ays:
"Nevertheless, they hayÂ» etUl la.ge
sums to lend on city real estate at 6 per
cent a year, gross, they paying the moit
gage tax. The net rate they receive this
year Is 4.37. It sometimes seems that, no
I matter how much money the banks suc
ceed In 'nvestlng or relendlng. payments
of old loans kept far ahead of what they
can Invest or lend out. The much better
demand for real estate that has developed
i lately does not seem to aid our savings
banks much In getting rid of surplus
money. Their prayer for more borrowers
for the present remains unanswered.
"Private lenders last' month lent (567.164
on city real estate mortgages, and re
leased J3G0.250. The Hlbernla Bank lent
I $321,447 In the city and released $24.',
The It] mortgages given to the German
Bank In November amounted to JSS.S.V) and
Its releases were $99.0â¬7. The account of
the Savings Union In the city was $23 so

ber of Pity real estate mortgages record
ed in November was 25*7. amounting to

The local savings banks, building asso
ciations and private capitalists loaned an

IN OLD CHURCH
THIEF BEGS TO
BE LOCKED UP
Peculiar Appeal Made
to Police.
CONSCIENCE TROUBLED HIM
PRIEST HAD RETUSED TO GIVE
HIM ALMS.
One of the most peculiar cases of an
uneasy conscience following the commls
â lon of crime which has come under police
notice for some time attracted the atten
tion of the officers: at the California
street Police Station last night. An old
man, Oswell Sellger. residing at 7644 Mis
sion street, robbed a church, and the deed
â 0 much troubled him that he applied to
the police to be placed behind me bars
where- he might Buffer a penalty for his
crime.
SeMgrr entered the California-street Po
lice Station about 3 o'clock last night and
gave himself up as a thief. When ques
tioned he told a queer story. Ho stated
that while partially Intoxicated on Thurs
day afternoon he entor*Â«d St. lionlface's
church, on Golden Gate avenue, between
Jone* and aworth streets, and asked
one of the priests for a dime. The priest re
fused him and he turned away. His next
though! was one of revenge for the di
vines refusal, and a short time afterward
he again entered the sacred edifice "To
even matters up." as he stated, he stole
! box Ol tacks and left the church. These
he sold yesterday to some one on Pacific-
After the deed had been committed Se- i
llrers conscience began to trouble him. t
He wandered about the streets for some !
time and finally came to the police st.j- I
tlon The officers In charge dl.l not know '
what to do about the matter and tele- â¢
phoned to the Central Police Station, from !
which place an officer was sent to Inter- :
ylew the priests at the church and ascer- '
tain if they desired to prosecute the mar I
be answer was received that no action '<
would be taken against Bellser, and, upon i
his insistence that he desired to suffer '
some nensilty to relieve his conscience he '
was charged with being drunk and placed I

SMALL DYERS FEAR
RUIN FROM A TRUST
TWO BIG CONCERNS ADMIT A I

The consolidation of the two largest
dyeing and cleaning establishments of j

POSTUM CEREAL.
SCHOOL TEACHER
Pulled Down Hill.
"I relied on coffee so much to keep
me up. having bevn told that it was a
'mild stimulant,' that I hardly knew
What to do whÂ«n I found it was really
jjuiling me down hill. My sleep was
badly broken at night and I was all
unstrung. Am a school teacher and
was exceedingly nervous.
"When It became evident that I was
in a very bad condition, I was Induced
to leave off coffee and try Postum
Food Coffee. Mother made It first, but
none of us could endure It, it was so flat
and tasteless. She proposed to throw the
package away, but I said, 'Suspend
judgment until we have made it strict-
ly according to directions.' It F^ms
the bad made the Postum like she al-
ways made coffee, taking It off the
etove as soon ns it began to boil. Moth-
er was no prejudiced against it that she
did not care to try It again, but I got
ulster to make the Postum next morn-
Ing strictly according to directions,
that is. allow it to boil full fifteen min-
utes after the boiling btglns.
"We were all amazed at the differ-
ence. Sister said it was better coffee,
to her taste, than the old. and father,
who is an elderly gentleman and had
used coffee all his life, appeared to rel-
ish the Postum as well as my little
brother, who took to it from tho first.
"Fur a while, mother clung to her old
favorite, although she was sick more or
less of the time. Finally, one. morning,
phe drank a cup of Postum by mistake,
believing it to be coffee. We Joked her
po much about it, because she did not
discover the difference, that she finally
admitted she had occasionally taken a
pip of the Postum Coffee, and from that
time she proposed to use it altogether.

TOBACCONISTS WILL
BUY WEED BY TONS
HAVE POOLED ISSUES TO GET
TRAIN LOADS.
Inflaming Circular Letter of an East
ern Tobacco Concern Caused
Twenty-Five States to
Take Action.
The dealers In tobacco in this State
who have hut d' the goods of the Conti
nental Tobacco Company, the headquar
ters of which are In New York, have re
ceived a report of the proceedings of the
National Association of Wholesale -Iro.
cert from their representative at the New
York meeting. H. LÂ». Loveland. For soino
time the tobacconists have been disturbed
over a circular letter Issued from the â â¢!
fices of the. Continental Tobacco Company
and pent broadcust over the United States
to the trade. This circular gave notice
that beginning with November 30 â¢ ':.â¢Â« old
understanding concerning plug, chewing
ai:d smoking tobacco, under which the
dealers received a premium of 10 per cent
for helling the company's goods, would be
considered as at an end.
In the place of the old agreement, which
hnd not worked to the â  lafaction of the
Continental Company because the Jobbers
had for f:ood and iffldent reasons sold
large quantities of the goods of the Amer
ican Tobacco Company, a new set of rates
wiu advertised In the circular letter. The
way that the dealers In toLacco found sat
isfaction in this emergency was to unite
in the purchase of a huge quantity of to
bacco and bo manage to get I flat rate.
The circular .-â¢ forth that 1 per cent
would be deducted from the price list for
every l.'tf'O.Ou'J pounds of tobacco pur
chased per month. This ranged up to the
purchase of fc.ViO/ifX) pounds ,â â¢ - month,
with the corresponding percentages off.
It was fearlblc for the dealers in to
br.eoo by uniting their purchases to get a
gnat quantity and bo secure the advan
tage. At the meeting in New York which
Mr. Loveland attended there were twen
ty-five States represented and fifty-five
delegate*. The unit plan of purchase was
then and there ndopted after the schemes
of the Continental Tobacco Company had
been fully considered. Mr. Lovetand re
ported that the unit plan had been adopt
ed when he met with the local tobacco
nists. While the meeting was In progress
a telegram was received from President
Lee of the National Association of Whole
aale Grocers reporting that the plan was
working splendidly.

WILSON WROTE
THE BOND, SAID
EISENSCHIMEL
Surprise Sprung in
Kelly's Trial.
BARNES REFUSED TO TESTIFY
ATTORNEY DUNNE IMPRESSED
AS A WITNESS.
Â« _
Carl ElsenÃchlmel. the handwriting ex
pert, took the stand yesterday In Judge
Lawlor's court and corrected an Impres
sion heretofore published that Thomas A.
Kelly forged the "straw" bonds he Is now
on trial for having feloniously accepted
for the release of Harry Wilson, a thiev
ing negro. Elsenschlmel created a sensa
tion by testifying that In his opinion none
other than J. N. E. Wilson signed all of
the bonds and all of the releases. J. N.
E. Wilson was In court at the time and
the announcement created some conster
nation for Wilson and his friends and
surprise for the onlookers. Wilson said
that he could overwhelm Eiscnschlmel's
opinion with abundance of proof, and pro
ceeded, after the testimony of W. S.
Barnes, who followed the handwriting ex
pert, to make good his declaration.
During the trial on Thursday Attorney
Dibble, who represents Kelly, said that
he would like to put Mr. Barnes on the
stand for the purpose of proving that Wil
son, the colored prisoner, had offered $1000
to secure his release, as he was anxious
to return to a vocation of robbing, as
sisted by a woman with whom lie had
been consorting. Mr. Barnes, however,
refused to so testify and was dismissed
from the stand.
Henry H. Adams was then called to dis
; prove the theory of Carl Eisenschimel.
He said that he was familiar with J. N.
E. Wilson's handwriting and that the
writing on the bonds was not hi*. George
W. Rohe also testified that the hand
writing was not Wilson's, and as he had
sren much of it he was a competent judge.
Others testilled to the same effect. Dur
ing the proceedings Attorney I'eter F.
i Dunne entered the court and was prompt
ly placed on the stand to prove that
i Ktoenachimel was a learned and compe
i tent handwriting expert. Mr. Dunne.
, however, said that he was not a compe
tent expert on handwriting experts, and
, his testimony was declared inadmissible
by the court.
The trial will gn on again Monday.

VIII. THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF 16
Sixteen, alike for boys ami girls, >Â» a
somewhat trying age. It murks a period
of transition which may be gradual or ab
rupt, but which Is sure to partake of *.he
difficulties ajid embarrassments pccuHur
to those limes In which the human bving
consciously passes from one stage of de
velopment to another. For example, a
great deal la expected of the young person
of IC, and while he or she is usually criti
cized for conduct which older people if
gard as childish, for still engaging in ju
venile sports or for enjoying Juwnile
books, on the other hand the sisters and
brothers next in age, farther on the road
and beyond the milestone marked SO, sel
dom court the society of 16. Of course,
there are varying degrees of maturity In
different Individual:! and, broadly speak
ing, girls at 16 are a year or two in ad
vance of lioys In spiritual and moral if
not In strictly intellectual progress, I tit
as a rule at 16 one has left childhood Just
behind and la reaching forward to man
hood or womanhood just In advance. It
Is for both sexes the place "where the
brook and river meet." A problem to
their friends and teachers, young people
at this critical parting of the ways, or,
rather, the rushing in of the v.ur.'l and its
influences, are often intensely puzzling to
themselves, confronted by temptations
too subtle for their comprehension, and in
need of tolerance, sympathy and the most
judicious and loving supervision.
Reading shapes character. A strong: Â«Mid
vital book becomes permanently potential
In the making of a man. One cannot too
carefully guard the home from the bad
book, the weak book, the Insincere and
meretricious book. If a boy or girl i- ever
to write well or Is ever to bedisilngueisned
for clever letter! and for terse and charm-
Ing expression, he or she must read the
bCSI book*. If ever conversation is to â â â â 
uplifted from the trodden nits of the com
monplace, lrom the dusty domain Of tne
trivial, it Is to be througn the medium of
the bright and suggestive book. From tue
best author.- we receive ideas, we are ltd
Into the larger Heidi of science and of
thought, pna we obtain the priceless gift
of a varied and picturesque vocabulary.
So much of personality pervades a book
that long after its author Is forgotten his
very name unthought of among men, the
work he left, if sincere and worthy, lives
on and carries a message to the receptive
reader, if this is true of the compai
ly ephemeral book it is In a larger meas
ure and unfailingly the attribute of me
great masters of literature. Shakespeare
18 read by the farmer's boy on the r.M
side, by ,hr Prince in the palace, by the
child and the man alike, and. tike the
Hlble, ever presents new pnases and frekh
ideas to every generation. Who to-day U
unfamiliar with the work of Kipling?
If one is not a book lover at 16 l fear
he never will become that most fortunate
of beings. To pome persons books arc no
more than chairs and tables, than furni
ture, or an) other portable possession.
To some again they are tools, used at
need, to unlock the hidden treasures of
science, or to verify dates In history.
There are those who care only for the
superficial book, the book which amuse*
for the moment and Is thrown aside. To
be born with a love for books is to be the
heir of a great inheritance. Parents and
teachers sometimes exercise â >. right of
private Judgment over books, choosing
and eliminating and scrutinizing all vol
umes before they reach the youthful
hands. This is to treat reading as if it
were quinine or calomel, dealing it out
in doses, weighed and measured and duly
apportioned, i Ilk.- better, and I thor
oughly believe In. the good old way spok
en of by Charles Lamb In that quaint and
delightful essay, where he tells how his
sister Bridget browsed In an old library
at her will.
A child, t\irned U.r><Â«*> in a library, like a
colt In a pasture, will select for herself
and. If her choice fall upon a really living
book, the evil in It will prove to her Inno
cuous, and the good will sink In!

Ignorant of the Bible Is to lose the virili

the most enduring literature In human

IX. RECREATION AND AMUSE

Most people want amusement, not rec
reation, though finer is the meaning of
the latter word, re-creation, the making
over of one's self; for constant doing .if
the same thing, whatever it may be. Is
weakening. Change of occupation la what
we all need, save that young people like
change by way of amusement, not by re
creation.
"To play with you" (the latest society
phrase, with Its breadth of signification
from a summer flirtation to a merry
friendship) Indicates the lighter Inter

It Is rather provoking that four cause*

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK. Dec -Bradstreefs financial
review to-morrow will Â»ay:
Speculation has narrowed perceptibly this
week and the fluctuations in the stork list were
otrnln. to â  very large extent, due to profes- i
rlor.nl trading. The deposition of the public
us ihe end of the year approaches, film, to
be to reduce Its outstanding speculative con
tracts nnd io wait until the January disburse
ments era completed and th* money market, as
It Is hoped. Is returned to a normal condition
The fact that supplies of funds In the call |
loan market were apparently smaller this
week, and that the bulk of the borrowing was
at 6 per cent or better, tended to support this :
view and to render the street at largo cautious
If not bearish. The fact that no Important re- 'â¢
turn flow of money from the Interior can be
detected, 1 â â ;: on the contrary, the South and
other sections continue to draw funds from
New York and that the rales of Government
bonds to the treasury under the extension of
Secretary -.... - s offer an- now practically sub
landed, are not without their effect on senti- 1
ment. Moreover. 11 Is appreciated in banking
circles and by large speculative Interests that
the. critical point In th- foreign financial situa
tion is approaching. The Bank of England It
Is true, â¢lid not advance Its rate this week
While the Hank of France marked Its figures
up to 1% per cent to meet the probable move
neat of ,rold from Paris to London fore
shadowed by a rise In rterllng exchange at
the former city. Bankers hero are din Â â =,-,'
to believe that the Bank of France w|"i Sot
oppose the transfer of a limited amount of
Bold to London and In commenting on the
strength of sterling exchange In New York
proclaimed the belief that no gold will be
Bhipped from the foreign monetary position
complicated as It Is by th- war In South
Africa and the slow and doubtful progress of
the. nrltlsh forces, which undoubtedly acts as a.
check on the markets here and Increases the
disposition to restrict transactions and dis
couraged decided speculative activity while
such elements of uncertainty are apparent.
3radstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Dec S-Bradstreet', to-morrow
will say:
The lust month of the year ha* opened aus
piciously, finding trade and industry generally
well employed, demand treading close upon and
arm parsing the supply, labor troubles averted
In some Instances by widespread advances In
wages, of small Important excepting In onÂ«
or two cases and with the general level of
values of staples at the highest point reached
for eight years past. The holiday demand has
opened well and collections from retail trade
therefore shows some Improvement.
The strength of cereals, notably wheat, th!Â«
week Is a reflection largely of decreased re
ceipts at the Northwest. Increases in Novem-
I tx-r business were not as large either In this
I country nor abroad as they were a year ago
I and to this extent the outlook Is less bearish
I and owing to the smaller world's production
this year hopes of well maintained prices have
t not beÂ«-n abandoned.
After a year of unprecedented activity and
advancing prices Iron and steel are quiet, with ;
| few nlgnltlcant changes, partly because the
season of the year does not favor new work
and partly also owing to the fact that the pro
ducer* are very generally sold up to the mid
die of next year. Prices show no marked
change, plates and sheets' being - relatively
weaker among th- finished products, while
bars are strong. Copper shows little change
but tin is lower again, affecting decreamnr
rpeculative Interests and smaller consumptive
demands. Activity in hardware Is largely con
fined to holiday specialties, which are ex-^erl
: â¢â¢tj.-lng an active movement at most market*
The feature of the coal trade has been the
Increasing scarcity of bituminous grades east
and ,' lv ' M - some markets being reported prac
tically bare of supplies. v
The strength of wool Is apparently unim
paired, though the demand Is quieter. London
I prices have again moved higher and thÂ« small

Dun's Rezriezv of Trade.
NEW TORIC. Dec B.â R. O. Dun A Com
pany's Weekly Review of Trade, which Issues
to-morrow, will say:
The approach of a new year usually brings
so much hesitation In business that small
shrinkage this year Is surprising. Probably
never before have the productive forces of the
country been so largely covered by contract*
at this date. Insuring employment and profit
, far Into the coming year. This results, not
from any mere speculative excitement, but
from actual demands for consumption running
far beyond the productlng capacity hereafter,
. and pushing it to remarkable expansion. The
Increase In foreign trade has been Insignificant
compared with the lncreaso of twenty-four
thousand millions In payment through clearing
houses. For thÂ« week the payments have been
i 20.3 per cent larger than last year and 38.1
! per cent larger than In 1592.
prices of plglron. strongly maintained
through extraordinary efforts, promise an in
; crease of over a quarter In producing capacity
I within a year because the entire output of the
most of the furnaces for the first and In part
of the last half of the next year has been sold
1 Sheet 'bars are a shade lower owing to the
closing of many tlnplate works.
Demand for cars and other railway equip
ment are enormous and aleo for shipping, for
lake and ocean. Tin Is weak at 27^0 and cop
per declined to 16% c, but lead and spelter are
stronger.
Hides are again stronger at Chicago, although
receipts of cattle at the four chief Western
markets In eleven months have been 3 per cent
larger than In the previous year, as the demand
for consumption in manufacture has evidently
incnxned much more. Thus Western produc
tion of boots and shoes has gained more than
expected, yet shipments in.m Boston for the
year have l^en 572.W0 cases or 9.3 per cent more
than last year, nnd ' â 'â  cases or 27.8 per cent
I more than In 1592. when cattle receipts were
7.1 per cent larger than this year.
Wool haÂ« advanced further with much specu
lative buying, though most manufacturers have
supplied wants, for the present and are less dis
posed to purchase at prices now averaging
higher than at any time since June 15. 18*J1.
' Higher prices demanded In the Interior and
rising prices abroad give confidence in spite of
the fact that goods have advanced â¢ from the
lowest point this year only 18.2 per cent.
Wheat has arisen 3 cents and corn a frac
tion with a decline in Western receipts of

place as a factor In the strength at the open-
Ing of the wheat market when May showed
a rain over night of HÂ©Uc. Commission
houses were In the pit with a plenitude of
country orders, but these were mostly for
email lots. Their buying, together with pur
chase* made for the short account, was suffi
cient to boost the price, the ascent. early car
rying May to 70'^c. Bullish sentiment wan
emphatic and aside from Â«>ine vigorous sell-
Ing gainst calls, which pushed the price back
for plight losses, there was nothing Influential
enough in the statistics to depress the market.
Early statistics of a bullish nature were rein
forced later by confirmation of the report of
rain In the Argentine, where harvesting Is on.
The Inactivity of trading was due principally
to the disposition of traders to await some
fresh Inspiration of greater stress on previously

LONDON, Dec. The wool auction sales

of an excellent character. The American. Bel-
Klum ond German representatives were the
chief buyers of merinos. Greasy scoured were
readily taken by the home and continental
buynrs. while locks and pieces realized extreme
rates. Suitable crcsabreUs were eagerly taken
by America.

Chicago opened firmer on better foreign a.l-

j at the advnnce, and the free buying by leaders
looked as if prices might go higher. North
western receipts were light. Argentine ship

ported higher. Toward the close of the session
the advance was checked by selling agaJnat

by shippers are all being cut down about one
linlf, which leaves !.in-Â» consumer, with very
little re*crÂ»e fuel on hand, certainly .â¢Â»Â» than
they have heretofore had for years. Ther*
are about ten vessels due here this month with
foreign coal. They would como to a good mar
ket It they were yet In first hands, but they
have passed Into second hands lone since. All
foreign grades being ordered now coat fancy
llKures. as coal carriers are only procurable at
hleh rates of frelsht frum (treat Britain an.l
Australia. From the latter source chntro
brands or gas and steam coal, cost about IT 25
to land hore. r.hlch Is the highest point in
several y*-ars. If th- Honolulu requirements
should ea*e off somewhat we may look for
cheaper Odonlal fuel. The scarcity of domes
tic coal Is very apparent from the lints of
wagons whlrh are etrung out on thÂ» arrival of
*tt-nmer* and sailers from the north. It la
{(ratifying to se* the market prices remaining

HE â¢Vlt filed by Martin Carter to

Bter stref-t tirMi-Â» is llk*ay to ot
pose a row among the contractors
of the State,, even should It not
expose a state of facts such as is
alleged in the complaint that was flied
in this county yesterday.
Martin Carter 1Â« believed to be only
rvrting for some one cl'<> In this matter,
and the Cotton Brothers assert that that
pome onÂ© else Is the Sin Francisco Bridge
Company, who did not get the contract.
But whether Mr. Carter is acting for htm
felf or for some ono else he Is one of thÂ«
most responsible residents and business
men in this county. He is the surviving
member of the car building firm of Car
ter Bros, of Newark, whose car? are run
ning on every stret-t car line and many
railroads in this State. He has money
and is amply able to prosecute any suit
that ho may bring. He has never mixed
in county politics, and so no politics can
t>Â« laM at the door of this suit at present.
J. C. liatrs of San Frnncieco Is the at
torney In the suit. This variety of case
fcrms to be Mr. Bates' specialty, for he
was the attorney in the suit that broke
the contract with the city of Oakland for
JrÂ»-<JslnK Lake Merritt.
The Carter suit asserts that the plans
and specifications for the bridge were
char.pf-d after the adoption of the plans.
and that there was a substitution of or.c
paÂ£o >,t plar.s which gave Cotton Bros.
the advantage of $7'XÂ» in steel work alone.

believe thai these change* all fell upon
shvet tt-ei thÂ«rTÂ»iansrTÂ«-mch-i3 the sheet
referred to in this suit. Then the Super
visors adopted the modified and lighter
plan? ami requested Cotton Bros, to fur
nish half a doÂ« sets of blue prints for
tho use of other bidders. This the Cot
ton i;ros. did, but tht'3Â» extra blue prints
were not county records, and did not
come to my office, and whether Cotton
Uros. furnished the other bidders with the
old or tho new plans only they can tell.
Nothing can be laid at my office In any
event."
Ernest Cotton of the firm of Cotton
Bros. Â«fc Co. denied all of the allegations
In the Carter compinlnt and asserted that
tnls was merely an effort to delay tha
construction of the bridge.
i. # T . h . tre is nothing In that complaint, and
it will make no difference with us and we
are going right on with our work." said
Mr. cotton. "1 will not say Just what our
answer is going to be. but we are .ing to
nght this suit, and we can beat it without
the least trouble. It is merely an effort
to get us tied up bo that we can't get our
money and so that our work will be de
layed. Tho next move will probably be
to en out an injunction. This suit is
brought by the same crowd thai knocked
uut the Lake Merrltt dredging contract
and they are merely pursuing a dog In the
manger policy. They lost the contract
and arc now trying to fight us because we
pot It. There was but one set of plans
adopted, though the first plans were mod
ified at the suggestion of the offlcin
county expert. Those plans are on file and
have never be*n tampered with. Such a
charge l.Â« false and ridiculous.
"At the reuuost of the Hoard of Super
visors wh furnished four sets of blue
prints for the use of other bidders, and
these prints wer* all of the plans as mod
ified and adopted. If the San Francisco
HrMge Company was not sure about Its
plans the originals were on file In the
County Clerk's office. There has been
nothing criminal or wrong, and this is
merely a suit of the knockers."

TITESAXFR AN CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9. 1899.
MISS FLCRE Ci~ SHARON.
In the costume In which she appeared at the Society Pastorale
Photo by Bushnell.
OAKLAND. Dec. B.â Artistically, socially and financially the production
of the pastorale. "Adlia and Aeon." ,â¢ the Dieti Opera-house tn-nlKht
was a success. Miss Floret Shamn, as the beautiful shepherdess
In Peter C. Allen's idyl, and MlSfl Pauline Fore, as the enamored shep
herd, were a delight to the eye and ear. The fur*- part of the music mi
enjoyable. Society was there in toto, and without doubt the result will be a
neat sum for th" local charities.
Nearly an hour before the chorus of men's voices oppned the programme
the hall began to fill, until the lower floor Wai occupied and dainty gowns were
forced to trail upstairs into regions sacred to the gallery pod. When the slue
ers appeared there as a long rustle of approval, for many had come early
â¢vfil and thÂ« wait hat itemed Jang.^ though, as Is unusual in
amateur productions, the curtain went up on time. The opening: number wns
by Mr. Allen, who later led the orchestra himself, and shared honors with
Ncldllnger's "Rock-a-Bye," which the chorus of girls' voices gave further
along on the programme. It was entitled, "Go, Lovely Rose." and was ex
quisite. In the chorus were: Robert Clarence Newell director; K. D. Crandall,
â â¢ A. v en. William iCnowlea, Robert Chesnut, Philip Abbott. Harry Thomas,
Herbert Gasklll. M. W. Jellott. Putnam Grlswold. R. C Newell.
m- .-â  Jean Hush followed the chorus, giving the "Rhapsodle Hongrolso."
by M. Hauser. She was accompanied by Miss Florence Hash, and won her
audience so thoroughly with her rtolln that she was recalled twice, once to
piny and once to acknowledge hor honors. The Madrlgj^J Club of girls then
sang very acceptably Parker's "Water Fay' and the Neiilllnger number. Miss
Elsa yon Mandersheld was the accompanist. In the chorus were Mary Ches
ter Williams, Miss Sharon. Marietta rlarena, Gall Converse. Miss Valentine.
Lulu Daniels. Edith hill, Ms- ForÂ«\ Blanche Sharon, Sara Hale, Gretchen
IJcrnett. Clara Converse, Miss McCabÂ«\ Gertrude Allen. lone Fore, Maude E.
Pcpe, Miss Pond, Dorothy Mohns, Mai tie Redfield. Miss Marwedel, Ethel Xl
tredge.
The event of the evening was of course the pastoral, an.l when the cur
tain disclosed the sylvan setting society forgot and actually craned. Then
to the septet of strings Miss Sharon came upon the stage In a pretty shep
herdess town and staff to search for her brother. Miss Fore, In shepherd's
dress, and looking as dainty and captivating as Julia Marlowe herself, fol
lowed.
The scene was extremely pretty, and as thÂ» singers lost themselves In
their parts, and were given confidence by Mr. Alien la the leader chair, the
audlenco forgot the scene in the voices. Miss Sharon's, a high soprano,' was
clear and true, and Miss Fore's, a sympathetic mezzo, no less beautiful. They
sustained their roles well and looked more than charming, the only regret
table fact being that there was a tendency on the part of the orchestra to
drown the voices.

IT'S UP TO SOMEBODY.
Two Plays With but a Single Thought
and That Not New.
At the Alcazar It's "Up to Watklns."
At the Alhambra it's "Mr. Plaster of

was "Mr Friend Next." At this rate
heaven only knows what It will be next.
When the Alcazur management decided
to put on Francis Powers' new play.
"Mctiier Earth." they found It was too
Fh'>rt for an evening's performance. They
decided to put on a curtain raiser, and
found the very thine: in a modernization

of an old timer. "My Friend Next," that
used to be a world beater almost as long
ago M Gariick> day. He called It "Up

theater to run Its course. Tuesday night
a portion of the house who had seen "Mr
Plaster of Paris" the night before dropped
at the Alcazar. He no sooner saw "Up
to "Watklns" than he hurried to Manager
Belasco with the Information that the
Slots were identical. Belasco didn't be

The poultry and bench show at the Ex
position building retains the unabated In
terest of fanciers, and large attendance*
have beÂ«n the rule every afternoon and

and to-morrow afternoon the students of
the High School will be admitted free of
charge.
It is announced that the next great
show under the auspices of the Alameda
County Poultry Association will be given
not in December, 1500, but a month or so
later, this being decided upon owing to
birds lacking In Mat in December, and
moreover since old stock la bad In molt
during that month.
The poultry show nan proved exception
ally elaborate this year. Among some of
the line.Jt exhibits are those or S. J.
Hunter of Fresno, whoso buff leghorns
figure prominently in the lift of awards.

OAKLAND will welcome the co
horts of the blue and gold to-
II morrow afternoon and the Mac-
donough Theater â wttt â receive
them there to witness the farce of the
State University's Junior clans. Great
Interest is manifested In the produc
tion, and not only has every seat been
long arranged for by either collegians
or their friends but standing room is
taken to a limit that will insuro
scarcely more than a glimpse or a
suggestion of the play to those who
arc unfortunate enough to get in lute
and thus di I secure front places.
The Junior farce this year, It iÂ»
claimed by those who have witnessed
the rchcarsials. will be not only a suc
cess numerically and socially but ar
tistically; and not a little of this prom
ised success Is due to Charles Bryant,
the well known actor and stage man

committee to stage and superintend
the rehearsals of the piece. Mr. Bry
ant has been untiring In his attend â¢
ance and labors and has met a cor
responding spirit on the part of those
cast for the play. To Richard IT.

fall the honors of the day, for this.

ceed In strength the farces that have
come before In university history.

out doubt be enthusiastically received
by Its audience.

versity student* until it Is explained
that the hero is a student in the col
lege of social sciences and In his first
year. He hails from Boston. The

Oakland's Teachers

OAKLAND. Dec. 8. -Health Officer
Todd to-night made a proposition to th*
Hoard of Health that no person afflicted
with tuberculosis should be employed tn

soon after Dr. D. D. Crowley's proposi
tion, made before the State Boar. of
Health for the quarantining of consump
tives, 1* of trreat Importance. The dbcus
slon thnt followed Health Officer Todd'*
suggestion went no far a* to bring In th-,
idea that children afflicted with tuber
culosis should also be excluded from the
free public schools, and President Kitch
ings and Dr. J. Maher of the Health
Board expressed themselves as brine very
favorably impressed with both ideas.

the way I feel about this matter."
No words of disapproval were uttcod

committee will not alone investigate the

excluding consumptive children from the
schools.
li'ilth Officer T0, 1,1 afterward stated
that the real purpose of his proposition
was the prevention of the employment of
consumptive teachers by the Bchool De
partment In the future.
"We have had teachers so afflicted In
the department almost constantly." said
the Health Officer. "I can cite one case
where a teacher suffering from consump

up to within J only ,-i " nor t time of her

INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION'S INQUIRY
Begins an Investigation of Changes
in Freight Classification and
Bates.
WASHINGTON. Dec. The Interstate
Commerce Commission instituted an in
vestigation in the matters of changes in
freight classification and advances in
freight rat<Â»s by carriers using the official
classification and fixed the date of hear
ing for December 21 at Washington. All
the principal railroads in the otticial class
lllcation ".erritory are required to rppcar.
Numerous complaints have been tiled
with the commission alleging that the
carriers nad determined to put a nt-w
classification in effect on the Ist of Jan
uary and to cancel numerous commodity
rates which have been In effect for several
years. These complaints alleged that the
new classillcation and rates would sub
ject shippers and shipments in ofllcial
classillcation territory to unreasonable
charges, unjust discrimination and undue
prejudice and disadvantage. The order of
the commission slates that It appears from
an advanre copy of the new classification
that a very large number of changes from
a lower to a higher class will be mÂ«.de
and that existing differences In classilica
tlon between carload and tees than carload
quantities of freight will be thereby con
siderably increased.
JAMAICA'S MISFORTUNE.
Crops Almost Wholly Destroyed by
the Floods.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. Dec. B.â The con
tinuous floods, culminating In a Fevero
norther from Monday to yesterday, have
augmented the destruction of the crop*
und Impeded the railroad, highway and
telegraph repairs, besides further damag
ing them. Consequently the outlook for
fruit exports is becoming grave. Even
with rowing it Is difficult to obtain ac
cess to what haÂ« escaped the flood.

TOM WALSH MAY LOSE HIS TITLE
AS THE CHAMPION DUCK HUNTER
TOM WAI, PH. who gives It to you
"straight' at his place of busi
ness, next door to the Spreckels
Market, little thought at tho he
pinning of the winter that his repu
tation as a dutk hunter would be go-
Ing n-Rlimmerlng by this time. Not
he. Season after season birds enough
had fallen to his (tun to supply his
family and the families of friends
with endless duck ' dinners. People
began talking about him and pointing
him out as the terror of the tules.
Hunters from all over the State came
dropping Into his place to gaze on the
"champ." an 1 men with dogs to Sell
hounded him daily.
A less moiiest man than Walsh
might have swelled up and burst with
less provocation. He did nothing Â«f
the kind. Of courre. he enjoyed the
praise, accorded his prowess, but it
nffeeted him in no way beyond con
firming him In the resolution to do
Â»tTVÂ« his reputation. He purchased at
once a big pair of rubber boots, a
hunting Jacket, a new-fangled duck
strap, a up-to-date reloading outfK
and a red dog. impatiently walling
the opening of the season.
Nineteen times since that date has
he donned h\<* hunting clothes, taken
his dog and gone up the river, through
... and over marshes for
ducks. Nineteen times has he returned
without a bird. He vouchsafed no ex
plnnation. and his friends were nt a
loss to account for his failure to con
nect.
"Tom's going hack." they Bald, with
shakes of their heads. "He must oe
hoodooed."
"Hoodco nothing." exclaimed Walsh
when the nmark reached his ears.
"It's that d d dog. I've either g>>t
to lose him or learn to whistle
through my teeth. That's all there' 3

MERCHANTS ARE
STANDING FOR
IMPROVEMENTS
The Association on the
Bfond issue.
DECIDED! ON a TEST vote
â¦
SOME OPPOSITION TO THE PAN
HANDLE PROPOSITION.
The Mwhints" Association; composed
of 1120 busings firm*. Individuals and or
ganizations, has come out flatly in favor
of the proposed Issuance of bonds for the
general Improvement of the <ity.
The directors would not commit the or
ganization "liber for or against the bond
proposition until the views of its mem
bers could be obtained^ To this end pos
tal ranis ct Inquiry were pent out upon
the question of the bond election and the
umounts of bonds needed for the several
projected improvements wen distinctly
set forth. The request was made that
â¦â¢ach member return a ballot po;;tal ex
pressing his wishes In the premises.
Over half have bo far made leturns and
with few exceptions the members stand
for the city Improvement. Tlw strongest
opposition Is tÂ«Â» the park panhandle and
the opening of a bouV-vard between Gold
en Gate Park and the Presidio through
the Richmond district.
At the meeting of the directors yester
day the position of the association was
set forth in the following resolution:
Whereas. Our city authorities have Kivea
leral notice of their Intention to bold bond
elections on the 27th and 2yth of this month,
for the purpose of rals-lni; money to build
bchools and Ml- â  to provide a mr*Jern
newer system, to extend the I'ark area anil
brlnr the Tanhan.Jle down to Market
street and connect the I'ark with the Pre
isldlo: and whereas, th< members of the
Merchants' A!"H"clatk>n have by h |MÂ»ital
card vote declared. f<> far as returns have
been, received, an follows: O>n.Â«tructlw;
nÂ«w sewer system, affirmative â¬23 and nega
tive I; constructing new schoothoures. af
fJmatlve Cl 7 and negative U; constructing
new City and County Hospital, aiflrmatlve
CII and negative 10; Park Panhandle, Rich
mond blocks and Mission Turk, motive
iZj and negative I'" this la an almost un
axilmmis deolÃratS&n In favor of the bonds
for fcewers, schools and a. hospital and over
two-thirds majority in fa\or of extending
the I'ark area and Park connections with
the city and l'rrsldlo. and a Ml union pub
lic park: and whereas, the principal object
of the Merchants" Association has always
been to work for the l>ettern>ent and Im
provement of our city: and whereas, we be
lieve that the new Charter provides efficient
machinery for the economical and effective
control of public expenditures; therefore,
bÂ« It
Kenolved. By the board of directors of the
Merchants' Association that we heartily
favor all of the proponed bond Issues and
request our members to do everything In
their power to bring about the success of
ihi>Â«Â» hor.d elections: and be It further
Resolved. That we request all citizens, re
gardless of party politics, to take a favor
able interest In both bond elections so that
by a united effort we may secure majorities
In favor of Improving the limitation of our
; city and the comfort and pleasure of the
people. Active participation in there elec
tions, which concern Important municipal
questions, will prove that our citizens now
take a lively Interest in our city govern
ment, and thereby encourage future efforts
for the Improvement of our municipal
affaire.
Following up the previous efforts of the
association to Improve the existing con-
I ditlons of the harbor front, a special ei:n
mlt tee, corseting of Directors Symincs,
Sherwood and watt was appointed to in
vestigate the Immediate wants of the har
bor and io confer with the Board of Har
bor Commissioners. The board also direct
ed the attorney of the association to pre
pare a report upon what steps are neces
sary and the method of procedure to
have the harbor front revert to the dty
of San Francisco. It Is the intention of
the board of directors to U3o all reason
able efforts In having the controUof thÂ«
harbor transferred from the State to the
municipality.
A number of Inquiries from memoers
were reported to the board relative to
j thÂ« authority of the License Collector to
| collect license taxes for periods that will
! extend beyond the Inauguration of tho
I new Charter on January 6. ISW. Upon the
advice of Supervisor I-ackmann. chair
man of the Committee on Licenses of *he
present Board of Supervisors, it was de
cided to recommend. to the members of
the association to pay such quarterly 11
censes, as will run Into the now year, and
to petition the Board of Supervisors to
allow rebates for such amounts as ex
tend beyond January 8, 1900. This as ex-
Und beyond January 8, 1900. This course
TITE FAN FHANCTSCO CALL. SATFRDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1899.
Walsh had been deceived In the dog.
The moment he heard the animal was
an Irish spaniel he bought and asked
no questions. The former owner for
got to tell him that the only whistle
Brian O'Llnnâ that's the dog's name
âwould recognize was one produced
through thÂ« teeth. If there's one ac
complishment Walsh lacks It's whist
ling rough the teeth. He can cock
a lip with any one on the line and can
Ftop a streetcar three blocks away
with the whistle he can produce by
patting a finger on his mouth, but he
never learned to whistle through his
teeth. Brian O'Llnn, who bad never
been taught to answer to any other
signal, was useless, therefore, to
Walsh, who found that out on his
first trip with the dog. Although he
lias labored ever since like a Trojan
to break the spaniel Into his own
style, he has not been successful, al
though be has a faint hope of ult;
mnte success.
For the twentieth time this season
Walsh left Thursday night for a hunt
on the upper Sacramento. With him
went Di J. R. Murphy of the Har
bor Receiving Hospital and the red

SOME AWKWARD QUESTIONS
>
Sheriff C. A. House Corroborates the
Testimony of Deputy Sheriff
Daley of San Bernardino
County.
Â»
ThÂ» cross-examination of Joseph P.
Frenna was practically concluded yes
terday afternoon to the unfeigned relief
of the defendant. Frenna may be recall
ed by the prosecution later to answer any
questions that may have been temporarily
overlooked by Assistant District Attor
ney Salomon, but he will not again be
subjected to a severe ordeal. When Fren
na stepped down from the witness chair
yesterday at the noon recess he address
ed the Assistant District Attorney, re
marking with a self-satisfied grin:
â¢Well, ain't I all right?"
Ho did not feel quite so "chipper" at
the close of the afternoon session. He
was called upon to answer MOM very
awkward questions during the Interval,
and In spite of the careful coaching he
has evidently received, he was often
plainly at a los* for an answer.
Bherifl C. A. Rouse of Baa Bernardino
County wa.s called to the stated .tt the
opening of court in the morning; and cor
roborated the testimony given by L>Â«-nu

The prow eTSmlnation of Krenna was
then resumed. He described in detail hiÂ»
movements of the fatal morning up to me
time be stepped out <<t the elevator and
confronted 'l urnÂ»<r. Then, using Attor
nej Balomon to represent the dead man,
he described with dramatic effect how
the crime Â«as committed. Ue declared
is Turner stepped iiai-k with t..- re
mark, "Frenna, . in shot* you," he
turned 50 that his left side w.i> toward
lit ana.
"H>- put his rlÂ«ht hand undtr his
coat, and just a* hÂ»- pull.-d it out again
1 commenced shooting."
Frenna remembered distinctly every
occurrence urect-diiiK the killing, wh-re
he went, with win. in be t;tl k* <1 and at
what time, and Juhi how Turner looked

A PROBATE BUREAU
PROPOSED BY RUEF
WILL ASK THE LEGISLATURE
TO PASS A BILL.
City Would Derive a Great Income
and Estates Would Be Protected
From Embezzlement by
Executors.
During the next session of the Legis
lature a bill will be presented having as
its object Hi.- establishment In this city
and county of an office known as Probate
Bureau. A. Ruef, attorney for the Public
Administrator, stated yesterday to Judge
Coffey that he would frame the bill and
see that it whs presented for enactment.
A vast amount of criticism has been oc
casioned of late through overcharges and
alleged overcharges on the part of attor
neys representing estates in probate, and
Mr. Kuef is of the opinion that the es
tablishment of the office would place mat
ters on a more even footing. The bureau
would be established for the purpose of
handling all estates, to the exclusion of
appointed executors or administrators,
and in addition to being a great source of
profit to the city WOUld be a protection to
heirs and prevent losses in the future such
as have resulted through the embezzle
ment of estate funds.
Judge Coffey said that the scheme pro
posed would have been included In the
I charter but for the opposition of a certain
local attorney, whose greed for gold ex
ceeded his Interest in the welfare of the
people.

ten was hanÃÂ»>d at Folsom prison at It
o'clock this morninK for participation In
thÂ»Â» murder of C. a. Andrews at Baden.
Ban Kateo County, on November 17. 1537.
He died without a stniKxlÂ»*. He attempt
ed to make a speech on the scaffold.
Winters was not his real name. He was
i German socialist and refused to give
any Statement repardtnK his family or
former history. He rejected the minis- !
trations of Rev. Father Nugent, the I
Catholic chaplain, and this mornlnc,
when the Rev. Mr. Bhadle of Sacramento,
the Protestant chaplain, visited him In his
cell, he used very profane and abusive
language and denounced the ministers of
the gospel and the Christian religion.
There were only about twenty-nv< vis
itors and the execution was one of the
neatest ever performed at the prison. i
Winters died in ten and a half minutes
after the drop fell.
In company with James Willett and C.
11. Raymond, alia* Samuel B. Moore,
Winters attempted to burglarize a hotel
at Baden, San Mateo County, on the night !
of November 17, iv.c. In a struggle with
Patrick Ferrltter. the proprietor, and C.
T. Andrews, a boarder, the latter was
killed. Subsequently Raymond was con
victed of murder In the first degree and
executed at Folsom on April I, IVty Wil- j
lett was captured In Arizona and pleaded
guilty, receiving a life sentence. He is
now confined in Folsom prison.
Winters had previously served two
terms in Folsom prison for burglary and
attempt to commit burglary. Raymond,
alias Moore, had served a term there fif
teen years, and also two terms in Oregon.
Wlllett also served ten years for burg
lary In Folsom.
TWO CRIMINALS SUFFER
THE DEATH PENALTY
HAGERSTOWN. Md., Dec. B.â Samuel
Johnston, colored, aged 22. was hanged In
the jail yard h*re to-day. . The crime for
which Johnston suffered the death pc l
alty was a criminal assault In July last
upon Annie Kerfoot, the. â¢ 14-year-old
daughter of a farmer living a few miles
from Hagerstown.
WASHINGTON, Dee. B.â Georgo W
Morton was hanged In the District nil
to-day for the murder of Jane NlcholÃon.
The drop fell at 12:12. Horton was an
ex-member of the police force, and Mrs.
Nicholson was a divorced woman. On th<?
evening of June . 24. ISOB. he met the
woman in Armory Park, and in the con
versation which ensued she announced
her determination to break the relation
which existed between them. An she
arosu from the bench to leave him ho
drew a pocket knife and slashed her
across the throat. In a frenzy of rase
he stabbed her again and again, almost
severing her head from her body. Nearly
one hundred persons witnessed the mur
der, but war* too paralyzed with horror
to Interfere. He made no attempt to
escape and yielded quietly to arrest. His
defense was insanity, and after his con
viction repeated attempts were made to
secure executive clemency. The Presi
dent. however, declined to interfere with
the sentence. Horton was a married man.
A thoroughgoing egotist is usually de
void of the sense of humor. J
