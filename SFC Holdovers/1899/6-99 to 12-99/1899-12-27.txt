subject is variously discussed by international lawyers of repute
in our columns. Upon this question is grafted another, which
though necessarily of a more speculative character looks large
among international complications that may arise out of the
British-Boer war. This is the question of Delagoa Bay. By
taking possession of that port Great Britain would in a sense
cut the Gordian knot of her troubles over the receiving of
supplies by Boers. She would undoubtedly arouse some
measure of protest among European powers, but she would in
flict a probably mortal wound upon her actual enemy.
I.' INDON, Dec. 27. â The Times in a special article dis
cussing the international law aspects of Boer importations,
through Delagoa Bay says: "Were we to adopt cither with or
without the consent of Portugal the drastic measures which are
SO airily suggested in some quarters we might find ourselves
suddenly confronted with international complications far more
serious and injurious to the successful prosecution of the South
African war than the evils of which it was sought to secure an
abatement."

BUFFALO, N. V.. Dec. 26.-A special
from Dunkirk says: The Fenians
nre said to be organizing here for
the Invasion of Canada, A man !
, known to have knowledge of Fe
nian affairs la Dunkirk says this city
has been called upon 'to raise GOO men to
form a part of New York's quota for the
126.000 men that are to be enrolled
throughout the country. At the present
time 500 men are known to be mustered
With the Fenians here. The remaining
hundred will be obtained with little diffi

BOSTON, Dec, 26.â A movement look-
Ing to the invasion of Canada by the Fe
nians and the Advanced Irish National
ists has l>e<-n agitated for some time by
leaders of these organisations In and
around Roston. Colonel Roger F. Scan
r.el. who has been Identified with Irish
agitations for many years, raid to-day
that there was to be a meeting of promi
nent \ Irish Nationalists In Phlad'elphia
next Sunday or Monday to dISCU the
question of invading Canada.
"This meeting." Colonel Scannel say.*,
"will be followed by another In Boston,
when reports from the Philadelphia meet
ing will be made by Boston delegates."
Colonel Bcannel says that the present
would be a good time for the Invasion, as
the troopa of Canada arc being sent awry
to take pan in the African war.
"It ha* been agitated for years" con
tinued the colonel, "that Canada should
either he annexed to the United States i
or should have an independent govern

organized all over the country and have
confidence in their leaders
WASHINGTON, Dec M The British
Embassador. Lord Pauncefote has made
00 protest to the authorities hero relative
to the reported organized movement in
various parti of the country in behalf of
the Boers, Including the alleged Fenian
movement, although these matters were
, subj.-cts for discussion between Secretary
Hay and the Bmbassador as late as this
afternoon. The only attention which the
Embassy is giving to these reports is to
keep advised through the British Consuls
at various points as to any movements of
importance. Thus far. however, nothing
has come from the Consuls to indicate
that any of the movements was more
than local and trifling. All of the advices
â how there has been nothing in the way
of a general organization.
Should it turn out that a Fenian move
ment of the kind alleged to exist Is ac
tually discovered and brought to the at
tention of the United States Government
sharp and prompt repressive action win
be taken, not only to prevent the viola
tion of the neutrality laws, but also to
save the raiders themselves from such
consequences of their actions as befell
the unfortunate Fenian raluers of 1566.
The talk of a Fenian raid Is well cal-
c ulated to cause alarm on the Canadian
side- of the border, as the people of that
section were greatly agitated during the
former Fenian excitement. Although an
actual movement occurred then the
chief trouble occurred over alarming re
ports Of Invasion which never took place
Something ol a panic took possession of
the Canadians on the border and many
women burled their valuables on the
islands of the border river. On the Ameri
can side the excitement was Intensified
by local Fenian organizations, which
drilled in apparent anticipation of a move
ment, although these proved to be purely
| local bodies, more or less sympathizing
with the movement, but wholly without
systematic ccnnecUon with the head or
ganization.
at the War Office, at which were present
Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for
; War. and Lord Wolseley, commander In
chief. It lasted for hours, during which
it was demonstrated by argument* thru
the opinions of those present were far
from being unanimous.
"Then 1 will go." Mid Lord Roberts
That whs after the gathering of great
men at the -Ministry of War had agreed
to give up any further attempts. to lead
the local campaign from maps studied In
these dingy quarters called the War Of

! But it had been an awful struggle. Lord
Wolseley may be well enough Inclined
but then he has to do with a whole nest
I of permanent high officials who have lived
; all their lives amid a halo of red tape
and who love and revere that atmosphere.
"Bobs." as Lord Roberts is familiarly
called, knows this. He agrees with the
South African, who had been in the Mat
abelo and Zulu wars, that red tapeism and
departmental Jealousies must now and
forever cease If the British army is to
do any good In South Africa. Having
gained â  victory and being in a position
, to dictate to the War Department instead
of the' reverse. Lord Roberts said:
"Now give me Kitchener." Thus he
was given Kitchener. Now, from what I

JONES POSITIVE
WOLFSOHN IS DEAD
Young Man's Relatives, However,
Offer Evidence to Prove He Is
Alive and in Chicago.
L.OB ANGELES. Dec 36.â When S. A. D.
Jones, locul agent of the New York Life
Insurance Company, was interviewed to
day regarding n story from Chicago that
Aaron Wolfaohn, whom he insured for
$10,000 and who committed .suicide and
was burled here, had turned up alive In
Chicago, he said he could not believe the
Chicago story. Mr. Jones does not under
stand how the thing haa been brought
about, but he is positive that the man
whom lie insured a* Aaron Wolfsohn is
dead. He has taken every means pos
sible to Identify the man and says there
Is no doubt. However, he is going East
to make a fuller investigation.
Mn. U'Nell, the woman who paid for
the funeral of the man who committed
suicide, also supports Jones. She was
present when the medical examination for
the insurance was made; she was very
intimate with Wolfsohn; she gave him
$3 â Â»"' to go But and corresponded with him
while he was there. When he returned
she happened to be In San Francisco and
did not see him until after he was dead,
but she positively identified tho body.
There Is only one theory, and that is that
there are two Aaron Wolfsohnn and that
they look alike. The matter l.s a great
mystery here.

for Henjamln Wolfsohn, the father 1

Th. i. marks of the prosecutor were

and eventually the prosecutor was heard

having violated the oleomargarine laws,
has been made to President McKinley.
and the Attorney General now has it

For three years the cases were stubb<Â»rn

the men were convicted. Wilkins to pay a

ASSIGNMENT FOLLOWS
GLOBE BANK FAILURE
Boston Manufacturers of Sporting
Goods Forced to Close Their
Doors.
BOSTON. Dec 26.â The John P. I.ov
ell Arms Company and tho John P. Lot
ell Company, an allied firm, manufactur
ers of sporting goods of all kinds, made
an assignment to-day for the benefit of
creditors. The firms were heavily mi
i debted to the Globe National Dank, which
was last week placed In charge of a tem
porary receiver, and this Institution, or,
rather, Its former president, Mr Cole,
I has been represented In the business by
C. W. Norcross. who Is said to have vir
â¢ tually managed the concern for more than
a year past In the interest of the bank.
It has been said that Mr. Cole, late
; president of the bank, exchanged tho
paper of the Lovell Company for mining
' securities, but the fact that Mr. Norcross
: has remained in charge up to the pres
ent time would seem to cast a doubt upon
this story. It is Bald the merchandise
bills contracted by the company have
been paid as promptly as those of most
business houses, so that the manufactur
ers who have supplied them with goods
are not large creditors. the bulk of the
1 Indebtedness being to banks which have
, discounted the company's paper.
Coleman's Will Filed.
DIXON, Dec. 26-The will of the Into
N. R. 8. Coleman. one of the first plo

ha* been filed for probate In the Superior
Court at Fnlrtleld. Four sons and four
daughters survive him. Eight years pre
vious to his death he made a will, be
queathing to his wife his entire estate
naming his son Frank executor without
bonds. Hla wife died two years ago;
Dde that he was alive. N. Hessclberg. a
brother-in-law, at once recognized the
writing as that of Aaron Wolfsohn."
In order to complete the identification
of Wolfsohn, Mr. Hesselberg went to
Chicago Saturday with Mr. O Bryan, and
he .Is the., brother-in-law referred to in
the telegram received Christmas day by
the Public Administrator at Los Angeles.
Concerning* the .woman In the case, Mr.
Sale added that she now claimed to be
Wolfsohn's common law wife.
"She had," Mr. Sale paid, "evidently
kept quiet until the present time In the
hope of securing the money, not know-
Ing what evidence the insurance company
had accumulated. The burden Is now
thrown on her. . She will have to answer
why and how that corpse came to be in
her room."
Young 1 . Wolfsohn had not been In St.
Louis for nearly two years.
This strange story had its beginning on
July 10 last. Aaron Wolfsohn- was then
living In Los Angeles. Cat On that date
his father. Benjamin Wolfsohn. a cutter
and manufacturer of men's clothing at
718 Lucas avenue. St. Louis, received
news that his son was dead, having
breathed his last by Inhaling gas with
suicidal intent In the rooms of a woman
who at that time refused to give her
name. The son's life was insured for
$10,000 in the New York Life Insurance
Company. Evidence was produced pur
porting that the dead man was none
other than Aaron Wolfsohn. The insur
ance was paid to the Public Administra
tor In Los Angeles, but before the money
could be turned over to the young man's
family Aaron was reported to have been
recognized in the flesh, traversing the
streets of Chicago. The discovery was
made by an uncle residing in that city
and the young man's parents were noti
fied, and on August 11 the attorneys. Sale
& Sale of St. Louis, wired to the head
quarters of the New York Life Insurance
Company, which at once made a demand
on the Public Administrator for Jio.ono.
the amount of the Insurance on Wolf
sohn's life, which is still held by him.
Later the report that he had been recog
nized In Chicairo was denied, and thus
matters have stood until the present
time.

lands nn>l his palatial residence to his
four daughters. According to law they
were entitled to a share of tho remaining
estate, but they have shown their gener

BERLIN. Per. 26.-The German Gov

of acquiring tho Danish West Indies,
either by purchase from Denmark or
otherwise. The correspondent of the As

EARTHQUAKE SHOCKS

Two of the Injured Women Die and
Goods Are Being Moved to
Places of Safety.
SAN JACINTO. Dec. 26â Everything
Is still in a dilapidated condition
after the disastrous earthquake of
yesterday morning, though owners
of wrecked buildings have been con-
Btantly at work clearing away the
debris and strengthening the tottering
walls. Merchants are digging out what
little goods remain undestroyed and are
taking them to other placed for safety.
Hams. blacksmith shops and halls have
been brought into use and tons of valu
able property may be seen piled in them
in Borry-looking heaps. They tell of the
gravest catastrophe that has ever struck
this valley. A few merchants have open
ed up for business at the old stands which
present pitiable sights, with broken raft
ers reaching almost to the floor and the
sky visible through great ctofU in the
roof, and a layt-r of brick ami mortar cov
ering shelves and floor. Many of the yet
Standing walls are on the verge of col
lapM and it is dangerous to go near them,
but many with tin- desperation of despair
:tr>- working siruiitid them trying to save
what they can. The losses are piling up
high and it is now evident that the build
ings which it was thought yeat.rday could
be partially saved musi lie torn entirely
down in order to be strongly rebuilt.
The County Hospital, which was built
last year at a cost of JlO.oou, is a total
wreck, though all the inmates escaped
uninjured. The losers of property were
nnn*' of them rich men, so the destruction
leaves many of them bankrupt. They
walk around apparently dazed by the
thought of losing the product of years of
toil in a few seconds.
The losses cannot be much less than
$60,000, which is total, owing to the fact
that nothing but fire policies were car
ried.

and other towns that all the pecuniary

Buchanan, one of the best-known psy
chologists In the world, died at his resi
dence on Delmas avenue to-day. He was
a native of Frankfort. Ky., and 85 years
of age. He had a great reputation as a
writer on scientific subjects. Dr. Bu
chanan learned the printing trade when
a boy, afterward studying medicine and
graduating from the Louisville Univer
sity in 1946.
Dr. Buchanan is said to have been the
originator of psychology. He was one of
the founders of the Eclectic School of
Medicine, and from 1846 to 1856 was pro
fessor of physiology In the Eclectic Medi
cal Institute at Cincinnati. Ohio, and
later dean of the faculty from 1860 to UK
He also edited a medical Journal con
nected with that institution. Deceased
was connected with similar colleges In
New York and Boston.
Professor Buchanan discovered what he
calls the sciences of psychometry and
earcognomy, and claims to have demon
strated the action of the brain on the
body as Its controlling physiological or
gan. He published "Buchanan's Journal of
Man" from ISM to UN in Boston. Dr. Bu
chanan has also written "Outlines of Lec
tures on the Neurological System of An
thropology." "Eclectic Practice of Medi
cine and Surgery," "The New Education."
"Theurapeutic Sareognomy," "Manual of
Psychometry," "Cerebral Physiology"
and other works.
He was engaged at the time of his death
on a work on "Primitive Christianity,"
several volumes of which have been com
pleted, and have attracted great atten
tion among spiritualists. These contained
spirit pictures, as revealed to the doctor,
of John the Baptist and others, and have
been largely commented upon. In all he
has written over 100 books on scientific
and spiritualistic topics. Although over
four score years, he was a great worker
and wrote nearly all the time.
Dr. Buchanan had an International rep
utation as an astrologer and phrenologist.
He was also recognized as a successful
forecaster of events. A couple of years
ago he predicted the war this country
indulged In with Spain, and also the ex
pansion of United States power beyond
the seas. Several years ago he came to
San Jose for his health. He had been 111
for some weeks.
Mrs. Buchanan, who is also a writer
of some note. Is now in Denver, but had
been telegraphed for. No time has yet
been set for his funeral, but It will un
doubtedly attract prominent spiritualists
from all parts of the State.

TOI.EPO, Dec. 2(sâ Judge Morris, In Common Pleas Court, to-day rendered q
,-, an unusual derision as to the rights of striking workmen. The members of o
Â£> the Bicycle Workers' Union struck at the Standard Tube and Forks.' Â»â¢
O W<irks. A temporary injunction was granted restraining strikers from V

0 This Injunction Judge Morris to-day dissolved, holding that the strikers <>'
Â£â¢ had a perfect right to keep pickets about the works and to talk to workmen .'â¢
0 *Â° urge them to come out. He held that there v..is no positive evidence of 0>
Â»â¢ threats and that tho number men employed at the works exceeded the .*

PEATTL.E. D*>c. 26.â On<Â» of the most
disastrous floods in the history of the
Plate 1Â« raging along the Nooksack River
In Whatcom County. It is estimated that
already $30,000 worth of damage has been
<1onÂ«Â» to the farms and buildings in the
flooded district and still the waters show
no indications of subsiding. Five of seven
bridges over th* river have been swept
a way, four of them being iron.
As yot the river ha* not rÂ«-arhc<l pre
vious high water marks by five Inches,
bat the deetructlvene.su of the flood is ac
counted for in its suddenness. A heavy
ctownpour of rain on last Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday, accompanied by a
warm Chinook wind which melted the
snow In the mountains is assigned as the
cause of the disaster.
Heroic efforts w^re made to save the
bridges which were swept away. At
Eve rson several frolght-car loads of rock
wen* dumped in the river, but without
avail. It is believed that neither rail nor

down on the distressed vessel and could
see that It was a bark til awash, all
masts pone, the crew waving lanterns and
frantically begging to be saved. A cr.'w
from the Noranmore volunteered to man
a lifeboat, and In the height of the storm
a steel boat watÂ« launched.
The cries of the imperiled ones were
now piteous, but the lifeboat had hardly
left the Noranmore when a tremendous
wave overturned It, and the would-be res
cuers were precipitated into the sea. They
wore life belts and managed to right the
boat. A line had by this time been thrown
them and they were dragged through the
waves to the Noranmore.
A second attempt was ma.de to rescue
those aboard the bark, but she had dis
appeared in tho darkness and storm. Al

Richardson stood by until morning and
then steamed to where he had seen the
bark, but she had sunk with all on board.
No wreckage could be seen, and It was
impossible to learn her name or destina
tion. She appeared to have had th:
masts, and evidently had been loaded with
a bulky cargo. The bark was a vessel of
probably 1000 tons.
The storm continued with unabated fury
and the Noranmoro had to change her
course several times, finally heading for
Norfolk. Captain Richardson sain in
all his experience he had never encoun
tered such a storm. The big ship sus
tained severe mage and will have to be
repaired here. The waves at times com

HIGHER EDUCATION THE
THEME AT SACRAMENTO
President Burk Suggests Many Improvements
in His Address Before the State Teachers'
Association.
I /"> ACRAMENTO, Dec. 26.â The thirty-
L third annual session of the State
Teachers' Association opened thirty
third nnnual session of the State
Teachers' Association opened in the
j vl Assembly chamber of the State
J Capitol this evening, with an audi
ence present larger than has ever
| greeted the opening meeting of the asso
' elation at any time In Its history. There
! was a varied programme, consisting of a
j number of welcoming addresses and some
well chosen vocal and instrumental selec
tions, but the chief number on the pro
gramme was the annual. address of Fred
erick Bark of San Francisco, the associa
tion's president. Mayor Land of Sacra
â  mento welcomed the educators on behalf
cf the city, declaring that he was proud
to meet such a body of men. as he had in
' his life met far too many men who could
i see no benefits in education beyond the
dollars and cents it enabled them to earn.
I He aroused the enthusiasm "I his :u il -
ence by stating in conclusion that in two
years Sacramento would pee the grandest
High School building in the State.
County Superintendent Howard wel
j corned the educators on behalf of Bacra-
T. J. KirK, State Fuperintend- J
ent of Public Instruction. J
memo County, the meat of his address
being that there should be earnest and
vigorous co-operation for the advancement
and improvement of the public school
system.
State Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Kirk, in extending a welcome on be
half of the State, dwelt chiefly on the de
sirability of Sacramento as a place of
public meeting and upon the points Of In
terest in and about it. These addresses
were responded to by Reginald H. Web
ster, Superintendent of Schools of San
Francisco, who said that in the republic
of letters there are no aliens, and among
scholars all may claim kindred; that it Is
a wide brotherhood, embracing all who
are struggling for Intellectual develop
ment. In concluding he said:
"The grandest result of the work of all
the ages is that education is not a benev
olence doled out by charity, but is a birth
right to which each and all ore entitled."
President Murk in his annual address
reviewed school work In California, and
said thai we must recognize the neces
sity of a sound foundation in an adequate
and competent system of elementary
schools. Sf.rie pupils go no further and
therefore tli>> need the best. The higher
schools nÂ«Â»Â«. well developed pupils from
these elementary schools. The most im
portant <â¢..!!. nt in the elementary school
Is the teacher. During the past ten years
the spread and Improvement in efficiency
in hlKh m !,. ols justifies the requirement
on the par-, of the State that the teach
ers in Its elementary schools shall ;Â»>&
sess, as h â¢â¢ inable minimum, the ho
lastic attainments of a high school grad
uate.
The growth of normal schools l<as
placed nltlihi the reasonable react* of
every on.- 1 me opportunity also for
training aru! knowledge of the technique
of â¢ teac'ilng. Yet. as essential features,
the requirement for the certification of
teachers is the same to-day that It
was twenty years ago. A certificate
is obtainable to-day as then, by
passing an examination upon the elemen
tary facts of the subjects taught, with
out any evidence of that culture which
goes with training In an efficient second
ary school, nor any training In the tech
nical matters pertaining to pedagogy.
The State has now a right to require
i more than this, and must do so If the
educational system of the twentieth cent
HE IS PROBABLY BEING
PRIVATELY CARED FOR
COLONEL J. H. RICKEY NOT WOR-
HYING OVER HIS SON.
The Man Was So Injured by Frilling
From a Horse That a Short Re
tirement Was Necessary.
The friends of Hyde W. Rickey In this
city who have been worrying themselves
! over that young gentleman's strange dis
appearance from the Palace Hotel some
ten days ago will probably rest a little
easier when they learn that Rickey's
father. Colonel J. H. Rickey, at present
at the Hoffman House In New York, is
giving' himself no concern about his son
who he Bays will eventually turn up all
right.
Rickey the younger arrived in this city
on the 10th of this month and registered
at the Palace. On the 14th he left the
hotel saying that he was obliged to go
to the Waldeck to prepare for an opera
! tion made necessary by an injury he had
suffered some time before. Later on the
! same day he returned to the hotel telling
1 the clerks that he could llnd no accom
modation at the sanitarium and would
be obliged to wait until the 16th, when
the hospital people would be ready to take
care of him. .â '..â â 
On the 16th he again left the hotel, os
tensibly to go to the hospital, telling the
clerks at the Palace that he would retun.
to that hostelry after he had recovered
from the operation. Since that time noth
ing has been heard of him.
Several telegrams arrived at the hotel
from his father in New York and wer*
at once forwarded to the WaldecK. From
I thero they were returned with the mes
sage that no such person as Hyde W.
Rickey was an inmate of that institution.
An inquiry at each of the many other
medical Institutions and sanitariums in
the city evoked a like reply.
Then the friends of Rickey became wor

could get no line on tbe young man any

fearing that he had met with some acci

The following dispatch, which was re

himself and will eventually turn up all

fallen from a horse a few weeks ago and
received Injuries which necessitated his

ury is to keep In sight of legitimate
Ideals, or to meet the demands mad.- upon
it. It was no longer necessary nor de
sirable. He contended that the normal
schools should not admit students who
had not completed the course of a high
school or give instruction in any branches
of academic knowledge already covered
by the high schools* curriculum. Twenty
years ago it was perhaps pardonable that
the normal schools should receive pupils
from the stage of grammar school
graduation, for there were then
few high schools, and these were
located only in the larger cities.
But this was a temporary makeshift,
for the high schools now are easily ca
pable of supplying the normal schools
with pupil*-. Under present conditions,
owing to the persistent survival of the
makeshift, two years of our normal
school course of four years is devoted to
academic work, attempting to parallel the
high school courses. Continuing, Presi
dent Burk said:
But In addition to the possession of teach
er* of PchoUrl) and professional training, mir
elementary schools must have competent pede
gogic supervision. To maintain good schools,
expert pedagogic Judgment In the selection of
teachers is essential. We need expert direction
and Ifaderrhlp In conducting the work of the
teachers and above all to assign Individuals to
duties to which they will bo most pedagoglcal
ly suitable. In the complete sense of the term,
we .is â¢i have practically no supervision what
ever of the elementary schools of California.
We have many capable City Superintendents,
but they are not with two or three exceptions,
delegated with sufficient power to exercise their
true functions. In the rural schools, which
most need supervision, there is no supervision
whatever worthy of the name. The County
Superintendent, under the law. Is essentially a
clerk. He has no legal voice In the selection
, of lead. era and the number of his visits to
schools Is far too few to be of sufficient ser
vice. There are no provisions which require
nnythlng of the candidate for the office of
County Superintendent in the way of evidence
at scholarly fitness. pedagogic training or qual
ifications as an educational expert. The office
Is filled by popular vote, or In other words,
political fitness Is the first essential and It Is
only a singular and fortuitous accident when the
, politically fit is also the professionally fit.
"There are remnant rang of California's swad.
dllng clothes and present advanced conditions
Justifying prompt reform. The only Super
visors recognized by our law are the members
of the Board of Education and board of Trus
tees. Now, whatever is done In the way of
change, history in this State an well as In oth
ers, make it mandatory that nothing shall In
terfere with the business authority of local
boards.
â¢ "The authority of local boards has Justly be
come recognized as the safeguard of the pub
lic school. Hut there Is a place for supervision,
nevertheless, under certain limitations. The
chief weakness of the local boards can be al
most exclusively traced to their Incompetency
to handle the professional side of supervision.
Trustees are business men, but as such they are
manifestly Incompetent to fulfill duties which
require pedagogic Insight Into the technical
side of education and they simply play the
part of the bull In the China shop in determin
ing the pedagogic qualifications of teachers, in
assignment and classification. In the arrange
ment of courses of study. In placing the school
uiH.n a professional basin and encouraging the
activity of teacher*, professional ambition, the
authority of the school trustee has, as a rule,
â  exerted a paralyzing influence for evil, quench
ing as It has the professional zeal of teachers
and encouraging unprofessional method/ of ad
vancement. In nhort, we need a new law
which nhall preserve for the local boards every
authority which does not deal with the pro
fessional and technical side of education, but
distinctly giving these problems to an officer
of supervision, who. In turn, must present cre
dentials of .pome kind which shall guarantee
a high degnÂ»a of competency In scholarship,
broad pedagogic Insight with the educational
problems of the day and practical methods for
thHr solution."
President Burk went on to say that the
constitutional convention of 1879. which
framed the present State constitution,
was composed of elements strongly preju
diced against secondary education, and,
as a compromise with these elements,
the present constitution gave sanction to
SOLIDIFYING SYMPATHY
FOR STRUGGLING BOERS
SOCIETIES OF THE CITY TO HOA)
A MASS MEETING.
Purpose Is to Repudiate the Impres
sion That America Is in League
With Great Britain.
Initial steps were taken last evening to
solidify the pvmpathy in this city and vi
cinity for the Boers and to crystallize the
efforts of the different societies who de
sire to extend financial and moral sup
port to the people of the Transvaal. A
meeting was held last night at the head
quarters of the Transvaal committee in
the Phelan building, which was at
tended by representatives of all the dif
ferent organizations that believe the
Boers are fighting In a JUBt cause.
It was decided, after considerable ar
gument, to hold a mass-meeting at Met
ropolitan Temple. Saturday. January 6.
Mayor Phelan will be asked to preside,
and among those who are expected to
make addresses are ex-Judge Ferral and
John P. Irish. One of the purposes of
the gathering will be to let the world
know that this section of the country re
pudiates the assertions that the United
States Is in league with Great Britain In
the present struggle. Another object la
to get an expression from the people as
to their ideas of raising funds for the re
lief of the wounded Boers and the
widows and orphans of those who have
fallen In battle. Whatever money may
be raised is to be placed in the hands of
the Red Cross Society operating In the
Transvaal.
It was also determined upon to organize
a woman's auxiliary to co-operate with
the men who nro Interested in the mass
meeti^ movement. A. F. Groh. presi
dent of the Holland Society, presided and
L. K. P. Vnn Baggen of the Transvaal

liberal support for the elementary schools
and for the State University, but speci
fically and magically prohibited the use
of any State funds for the secondary
schools which lie between the elementary
schools and the university. He deplored
this and said that State money should be
expended for the support of secondary
as well as primary schools. The useful
ness of secondary schools should be
broadened and such schools as the Lick
School should be in the reach of every
community In the State. The speaker's
concluding argument was infavor of a
more Intelligent system of school legis
lation, and as It was now bills were
passed with the sole design of raiding the
treasury. In the interest of some individ
ual or local constituency, and some bills
were bad through the ignorance of the
lawmakers.
"What Is her* needed." declared the speaker,
"lÂ» the existence of some competent and digni
fied body, protected by authority of law, to
which should be referred, for careful prepara
tion, all school legislation and the Jim appor
tionment of funds required for the support of
each department or Institution of the public
school system. California Is In urgent need
of some calm, honest, well-digested reorganiza

Wisely and economically with a tens* of due !
proportion and relative value of the vast and I
varied Interests at stake. The solution of this i
problem Is a tack which needs the combined
wisdom, honesty and deliberation of our wisest
educational forces in the State. Hut the time
is ripe for doing something and I believe that
It Is littlng and appropriate that this associa
tion should now take some active step in the â¢
matter. We may start, 1 believe, from the
generally accepted principle that the Legisla
ture will pass any educational measure upon
which the educators of the State In representa- ,
tive body express unanimity.
We need a commission which shall be rep
resentative of the best educational views:
which shall also contain a representation of
lay educators of the State of such standing and
dignity In the community as will command
the rwpect and attention of the Legislature.
Such a commission should consider the prob
lem of the reorganization of the school of the
State and lxÂ» prepared, to recommend to the
next Legislature either a definite budget of
school legislation or at least secure the ap
appolntment by authority of the Legislature of
such a commission to reimrt at Its following
session. The limitation of the action of this
body, however. Is a matter which may wisely
be left to Its deliberations. To this end, in con
clusion. I recommend that this association re
quest the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
the president of the State. University and the
President of Stanford University to appoint a
commission of which they shall be members
and of -such site as they may determine; and
that this commission shall consider by whatever
plan It may deem wise the reorganization of
the school laws to meet modern conditions and
to prepare the way for future progress.

Ucyond a doubt one of ' the best and
most artistically backed of the winners
at Oakland track yesterday was Plan.
The chestnut gelding formed one of half
a dozen starters In the litih event, a free
handicap at seven furlongs. Rising
young T. "Walsh and 103 pounds rested on
his back. In the ring 4 to 1 was chalked
against his name, and it seemed nal!<*d
there, for all that appeared to bu doing.
After Katie Gibbons had led to the
stretch King Carnival picked up the pace,
looking all over a winner. Nearer the
goal Thorpe on the favorite. Dr. Shep
pard. headed the King, only to be in turn
beaten i<ut v neck by the last-coming
Plan, which llnished on the extreme, out
elde. As it afterward transpired, the
winner's people, following the latest fad,
sent coin to the Eastern rooms and it was
said "got all the money."
The different events were keenly con

ALL SPANIARDS WILL
BE TRANSPORTED HOME
WASHINGTON-. Dec. 26-At the Cab
inet meeting to-day it was decided to con
strue that portion of the treaty with
Spain regarding the return of Spanish
soldiers and prisoners of war In. the most
liberal way. By the terms of the treaty
the I'nlted States agreed to transport ail
Spanish soldiers and prisoners of war
serving In the conquered territory to
Spain. Quite a number of disputed ques
tions have been raised In connection with
the repatriation of the Spanish soldiers
serving in the Philippines, and they have
been the subject of considerable "corre
spondence bwween General Otis and the
Spanish representatives at Manila.
In the peace treaty various tern-. axe
usedâ "Spanish soldiers," "Spanish pris
oners." " prisoners in the hands of Insur
gents." etc. After discussing the ques
tion to-day the Cabinet decided to stretch
the language of the treaty not only to
cover all Spanish prisoners in the hands
of the Insurgents, who are now falling
Into our hands, but their families and all
Spanish civilian officials and their fami
lies. All will be transported to Spain at
the expense of the I'nlti States.
Secretary Hoot has no Information as
to how many Spanish prisoners remain
on the islands.

NEW YORK. Dec. -Jt!.â Memorial serv
ices for Dwight Is. Moody, the evangelist,
were held to-day in Calvary Baptist
Church simultaneously with the funeral
services at Northfleld. The auditorium
of the church, which seats about 1000 per
sons, was tilled. Tho service was of an
undenominational character, arranged by
the friends <:f Mr. Moody here, md a
number of mini â â â  of all denominations
were present.
The services opened with the rendering
of Chopin's funeral march. Rev. I' R.
Morse, assistant pastor of the church,
conducted the ceremonies. In his remarks
Mr. Morse said that Mr. Moody did not
read the new testament In the original
Greek or the old testntnent In Hebrew,
but he was an sisslduous student of thfÂ»
KngllKh Bible He said It was hardly ex
aggeration to pay th.it Mr. Moody was
more familiar with the English scriptures
than any one In this country.
Rev. Dr. It. S. â¢â¢ Arthur in his address
recalled .1 peculiar Incidence dating
back to last summer, when he had writ
ten Mr. Moody asking him to preach In
n tent and -it night at the Calvary
Church. Mr. Moody replied that he was
not feeling well, but concluded:
â¢I shall be With you. though, and we
shall have a great service In Calvary
Church."
Dr. McArthur said: "Moody has now
taken his place among the Immortals. Mr.
Moody's evangelism marks an era in the
history of evangelization In England and
America."
Rev. Dr. Hillls of Plymouth Church.
Brooklyn, paid: "Moody was. in my
opinion, the greatest evangelist since
Whltfleld. nnd since the Apostle Paul
there has been no man who haÂ» preached
to s ,. great a multitude of people and led
so mar.v t. <"brlÂ«t."

LACK DF MONEY
NOT THE CAUSE
Recent Financial Flurry
Accounted For.
Pi<Â»< !nl l't-patrh to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Doc. 2*s.â Mr. Roberts.
Director of th.- Mint, was asked to-day
whether the present monetary strlnÃency.
in his opinion. signified an actual scarcity
of money to meet the present require
ments of trade. Ho said:
No possible supply of money can prevent
stock exchange panics or periods of monetary
stringency, because speculation and rising
prices will absorb any possible increase until
the pressure, for ready, cash Is Just as great
upon the new plane as It was upon the old.
THE EMPORIUM.
The cry for more money Is M unappealable
as the demand for man wealth. A new Â»up
ply. Instead of â¢Btlsfjrtna demand, stimulate*
It. Men want money to buy things withâ good
things that Â»hey think an coin* higher. <!lven
easy money In the banks and we have banker*
encouraging l>crrowers. As a result stocks g.i
up, an<l its they Ko up more people want to
buy and m the demand for money Increases.
You cannot furnlfh money fast enough to meet
the demand of all who would like to borrow
while prices nre going up. nor could all the
gold and silver mines In the world together
keep prices going up forever.
A marvelous era of Increasing money stocks
b^ran In 18S0 and started .1 period of specula
tion end ended In â  world- wide smash in 1857,
when even th.c Hank of Kncland hail to sus
pend payment without any decline In produc
tion and with 1..- mints everywhere open to
Uith told and silver.
The real secret of these reactions is In rprru.
litlon on margins. Those people who are cry
inc that they have been forced to throw away
their property had never pule' for their holdings.
They borrowed money on call to make small
payments, hoping that â  right turn In the mar
ket would give large profits. Hut In that class
of operations losses come as easily as profits.
That to one of the conditions of the cam-.
When they have profits they call It prosperity.
but when they have lOSSM they think the
country has come to a standstill and want
to know Who Is to blame. Nothing has hap
pened except that they have been asked to pay
what they owe. It la Impossible to do away
THE EMPORIUM.
with iiuch speculation by any Increase in thÂ«
money supply. â  . |
In short It I* n<>t ]< t;Mm.-it<* business that
/nuÂ»pÂ« thY enormnus Inflation of credits, mulll
liliÂ«><i the bfnk rp*ervcÂ» required anÂ«l thus ab
sorbs nny ptMWibl* money iiti>ck. Speculation
I'.'l'ttd will inevitably do It. .111. 1 as it In ob
viously Impossible to Mitl-'y that api>etlte It
!<â¢ absurd t> i-int to a tlcht money mnrket
at a i>ronf of an Insufficient supply of money.
Undoubtedly in* war In thÂ» Transvaal has

thing that disturb* normal condition*. which
turns the frrrtitÂ» of luislners out of the
course they have been expected to follow. Will
affect busSneM. With trail* balances ax they
RTf our bankers early 11 the season had reason
to extioct told lm!"'rtÂ« thts fnll and pmhably
directed their l>UiÂ«ineÂ«s nccordtngly. The wur
has not only cut Â»fT a remittance of about
J2,.Â«.v,, a week to I.ondon from South Africa,
but compelled henvy phlpments the other way.
Such a reversal of the regular and anticipated
order makes money tight In all centers until

occupy the minds of those people at this season of
serious and sober contemplation and cleansing intro

task before us, which is to end only when light
mindedness is extirpated, has its compensation in the
money we expect to make out of them while
we are leading them to higher and better things. It
is repeated w ith the persistence of a refrain to a song,
or the fugue in an old tune, that we are entering upon
the romantic era of our commerce, and that the ro

THE TRADE OF THE GREAT 'LAKES
UNLESS all the signs of the times are deceptive
there are likely t<> be sonic extraordinary
â¢ipi-> in tin course of commerce along the
ntry and Canada within
Owing to the vast output of
g^tn in the Northwest and increasing product
res from the mines along tluir shores the lakes
have become one of the busiest waterways in the
world, and the traffic along them is one of the mar
of commercial development Accordingly any
material change in the shipping routes will have far
i inscouen â 
A few yean :i^> it never occurred to the reason
tti the imagination of man that the traffic along 1
the la Id become too great for the lakes to
c^rry in their natural condition. That, however, is
what has happened. The economic advantages of
â  mull Ytw.|- in carrying freight hare been
men at to lead to the construction of larger and
n the lakes. They :â ;â <* now too larpc
for the comparatively shallow ri\trs which join the
ivernmeni oded many millions
of dollari in tiTorts t<. provide adequate channels, bat
with almost each succeeding year more baa to he done
< tt the demand of the enlarged shipping.
The latest scheme advanced iÂ«.r the purpose r>i
meeting the needs of the hike traffic is that of con
structing a great dam across the Niagara River at
the point whore it i~-ucs from Lake Erie, with the
â¢living the water in all the upper lakes and
and thai saving the expense of further dredg
ing and deepening of channels. It i^ sHd that such i
would raise the water in Eric three feet, in St
C'lair two feet and in Huron one foot, and thereby
deepen all the harbors on which the Government h -

m order to render them capable of receiving the big
freiphters of recent construction.
In the meantime the whole lake region and the city
of New York is much concerned over the probable

outcome of the improvements the Canadians are
making in their canal system which connects the lakes
with the sea. It is said that arrangements have been
made for the construction of a fleet of modern
steamers 240 feet in length to carry grain from the
upper lakes through the canals to Montreal, and if
necessary to Liverpool without breaking bulk. Im
mense warehouses and elevators are now being
erected at Montreal to handle the traffic. There is
nothing visionary about the plan, for an ocean-going
vessel 250 feet long recently passed through the Ca
nadian canals from the lakes and made the voyage to
Xew York.
As Montreal is .100 miles nearer to Liverpool than
Xew York is the possession of an unbroken water
way for ocean steamers from her dock? to the head
waters of Lake Superior will enable the Canadian
city to take away a large portion of the trade of
Xew York. In fact, the present metropolis is liable
to be sidetracked and American commerce with Eu
rope will be carried mainly by way of Montreal and
Chicago. The deepening of the lakes will of course
play into the hands o f the Canadians. There is a
good deal of uneasiness on the subject in Xew York,
I'.oston and Philadelphia, but all the lake cities are
cheerful and Chicago is beginning to feel like a city
of destiny.
Superior Judge Ogden of Alameda County, author
of that famous "you-may-stay-out-late-at-night-and
need-not-explain-to-your wife" decision, realizes now
that even that license has its drawbacks. While on his
way to visit a friend at an early hour Christmas morn
ing he had an encounter with two footpads.
WHEN on the assembling of Congress after the
holiday recess the Hoar resolutions are called
up for consideration in the Senate there vrill
he furnished to the debaters of tHt body as noble a
theme, as great an occasion and ;. important an issue
as ever excited the ardor of pamots, the study of
statesmen or the eloquence of orators.
The resolutions after setting forth that the pur
pose for which our Government was established and
to which its political action ought to be directed is
the ennobling of humanity and the elevation of all
who come lawfully under its power or influence, de
clare its most important and pressing obligations to
be these:
"i. To solve the difficult problem presented by the
presence of different races on our soil, with equal
constitutional rights. To make the negro safe in his
home, secure in his vote, with equal opportunity for
education and employment, and to bring the Indian
to civilization and to culture in accordance with his
need and capacity.
"->. To enable great cc j t ; es t0 govern themselves in
freedom, honor and purity.
".I To make the ballot-box as pure as a sacramental
ressel and the election return as perfectly in accord
with the laws and the truth as the judgment of the
Supreme Court.
"4 To banish illiteracy and ignorance from the
land.
" 5 To secure for every workman and for every
working woman wages enough t" support a life of
comfort and an old age of lei-tire and quiet, as befits
those who have an equal share i:i a self-governing
State.
"'>. To grow and expand over the continent and over
the islands of the sea just so fast, and no faster, as we
can bring into equality and self government under our
constitution peoples and races who will share these
ideals and help to make them realities.
';. To set a peaceful example of freedom which
mankind will l>c glad to follow, hut never to force
even freedom upon unwilling natives at the point of
the bayonet or at the cannon's mouth.
3 To abstain from interfering with the freedom
and iu-t rights of other nations and people-, and to
remember that the liberty to do riplu necessarily in
volves the liberty to do wrong, and that the American
people have no riftht to take from any other people
the birthright of freedom because of a fear that they
will do wrong with it."
The splendid principles set forth in that declaration
are not to be dismissed as "glittering generalities,"
mere academic abstractions of vague import, having
no pertinence to practical politics. Every one
them has a direct bearing upon some prcat issue of
the time. They refer to problems now before the
Senate and make plain the only rule of national policy
by which those problems can be rightly and sag.v
ciousty solved.
It is gratifying to have in the Senate a statesman
capable of recalling attention to these great principles
and applying them to the issues of the time at this
crisis in our national affairs. The people of the
United States have seemingly come to the parting of
the ways, where the choice is to be made between the
genuine republicanism of the founders of the Govern
ment and the spurious mixture of republicanism and
imperialism of the jingo statesmen who have at
tained such power in the ranks of both parties.
Are we to devote our energies to the work before
t;r. in our own country, or are we to waste our ener
gies, our wealth and the lives of our heroic brave in
a pursuit of imperial dominion in Asia? That
problem will affect to a greater or less extent almost
every act of legislation at this session, and it is
therefore well to have the general principles of our
governmental policy declared at the outset. The
Hoar resolutions set the issues definitely before the
people, and the public will wait with eagerness to see
how many of the statesmen in the Senate are capable
of discussing them with dignity and sagacity.
A little while apo it was said the British had
granted large concessions to the Germans and it is
now reported they have made concessions to the
Turks. It would seem from these reports that John
Bull has become liberal, but the chances are the con
cessions have been made at the expense of somebody
else.
The Bocr> may be far behind the times in some
things, but they are certainly up to date in sarcasm.
They have Riven the British the uncomfortable as
surance that if necessary every Boer may be armed
with two Mansers instead of one. If the consequent
damage would increase in the same ratio General
Boiler will find some way to get back to the Cape.
Spain has formally but somewhat tardily recognized
the Filipino government. If that exasperating Span-
Mi procrastination had not intervened what a lot of
trouble would have been saved for Uncle Sam.
<
Recent dispatches contain information that would
indicate an alliance between England and Turkey. It
wasn't at Genera! Buller's justly celebrated Christmas
dinner at Pretoria, either.
The Boers and the British appear to have taken a
rest on Christmas day and doubtless in both camps
the prayer for "peace on earth" was uttered with unc
tion.
The "puzzle of the century" is to tell when th;
century ends and the next begins.

The lire In the Botanical building has
prompted a very careful inspection of all

making changes where thought necessary
to prevent conflagration.
Bids for remodeling the gymnasium and
building an auditorium and for the con
struction of a chemistry building were
opened. The lowest bid was nearly $3300
In excess Of the appropriation. Mrs.
Hearst offered to make good the de
ficiency. Her generosity created a windy
debate on the propriety of calling upon
her every time the board was short of
cash. General Barnes expressed the opin
ion that it was a great Imposition on
Mrs. Hearst and humiliating to the Re
gents. He characterized the whole mat
ter a3 "the hat-passing plan of conduct
ing a university."
President "Wheeler stated that the lady
was only too glad of the opportunity to
assist the Institution and that it was un
wise to stand In the way of people who
wanted to do good. "This is her pleas
ure." said the president, "and It should
be our pleasure to receive it."
The discussion ended by the Regents
voting to accept Mrs. Hearst's offer. The
gymnasium improvements and the audit
orium will cost about $13,000 and the chem
istry building $5000. "Work will be under

the Coroner's jury on the death of Will
lan Ryan, who wns killed by i fall from
the second to th. first Boor of the build
ing 319 Pine street. The verdict was "ac

who own the building for not taking pro
per precautions.
The undesigned, working with Ryan
when he fell, take exception to the latter
part of that verdict. We were engaged
with him In constructing "an el vat and
enclosing the opening where tho accident
occurred. There was no staging or scaf
folding then needed, our work and his
being done on the floor. Ryan could not
do what he was then doing if that open

ed, nor could be do it by standing in the
opening even on .i staging. He deliberate
ly. In the presence of one of us, stepped
from off the floor down on the celling be
low and plunged through to his death.
We were all horrified at the accident, but
no human power could prevent it nor
could any precaution guard against it.

ONLY CRIME OF ITS KIND
AH LIM. WOULD-BE MURDERER,
AT THE MORGUE.
A suicide after an attempted murder
created <julte an excitement about 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon in the Chi
nese quarter and as the case is the first
of its kind to happen among the Mongo
lian residents of San Francisco it caused
considerable comment in Chinatown.
The trouble ma'!<- many believe that a
highbinder war had again broken "Ut.

.iXc us-d lor B '1 bU-Â«.-pi)iK
Ah How has been employed as janitor
in the house by the agents of the proper
ty for a !or.g time and has had frequent
quarrels with Ah Una, one of the lodg
ers, their relations being strained to that
extent that they would not speak to
each othor except in a business way.
A few days ago the dead man com
plained *<> the agents that his room was
in ,i leaky condition and asked in. m to
send a man to repair it. The agent called
:ut the house yesterday afternoon and
asked Ah Bow why be had not reported
the complaint, charging him with neglect
of duty. When the Janitor was told that
' Ah Lim li.ul made a personal complaint
at the oflico instead of to him he became
Incensed and went at once to Ah Lira's
room and :i: an excited wav upbrakt'.-d
him for his deceit. Returning to the
agent Ah Bow explained that the roomer
had entered the complaint for spite and
that he snonld be removed from his quar
ters on account of his filthy mode of liv
ing. After the janitor had finish. â ! his
conversation with the agent he again,
went to Lim's room and knocked at the
door. The occupant responded by open
ing the door a few Inches and then slam
ming it la Ah How's face.
Before the janitor had time to repeat
his knock the Infuriated roomer suddenly
opened the door and pointing a pistol at
his enemy fired two shots point blank In
his face. Ah Bow fell to the Boor and
the shooter started for his room. when,
hearing some one running up the stairs,
ho turned into the hallway and on reach
ing Its end deliberately placed the pistol
i to his right temple and tired.
The police soon arrived on the scene.
wh.ere Ofllcer Connors of the Chinatown
squad found Ah Bow leaning against the
wall bleeding from a bullet wound in his
jaw, while crouched in a corner at the
end of the hall lay the unconscious form
of the would-be murderer.
The patrol wagon and ambulance were
summoned and both Chinamen were sent
to the Receiving Hospital. An examina
tion showed that Lim had shot himself
through the right temple, the bullet al
most penetrating the skull to the back of
the head. He lived until 7 o'clock without
having regained consciousness and his
body was removed to the Morgue. Ah
Bow's wound amounts to a broken jaw
and he will recover.
Late last night a police sergeant made
careful inquiry into the case, ...s tho
position in which the body of the sup
posed suicide was found might indicate
that the shot had been fired from across
the room and the pistol placed In the vlc
j tlm's hand. Though the sergeant does not
j give much weight to the theory he has
advised the oHlcials to hold Ah Bow until
after the autopsy.

WORKINGMEN ON

NARROW ESCAPE

Revolving Screw.
ENGINES STARTED BY MISTAKE
CHANGES OF OFFICERS ON MAIL
BOAT MARIPOSA.
A gang of workmen had a narrow
escape on the steam collier Empire the
other day. The vessel was on the dry
dock, and the work of overhauling the
machinery and getting her ready for sea
was going on with a rush. Staging
had been placed around the stern of the
vessel and a number of men were en
gaged In keying up the propeller, shaft.
In order that no time should be wasted
steam was being got in the boilers while
the vessel was still on the drydock, the In
tention being to start for Coos Bay as
soon as the steamer was put back in the
water. The first assistant engineer was
in the shaft alley and the chief was on
the staging superintending the repairs.
Without a moment's warning the screw
began to revolve and striking the staging
threw the worklngmen and their tools In
every direction. Some of the men had
very narrow escapes, but no one was seri
ously injured. One of the kits of tools
was thrown fifty feet into the air and
fell right. at the feet of a calker. nearly
scaring him to death. No one seems to
know now the engines came to be turn
ed over. When the chief reached the en
gine room steam was turned off and not a
man on the ship would acknowledge hav
ing been anywnere near the lever. The
vessel was not damaged in any way.
The American ship Kennebee arrived
here from Norfolk, Va. f with a load of
coal In the nick of time. Her cargo was
considered a dangerous one, and when
she became a little overdue the under
writers got scared and began reinsuring
their risks. When the vessel reached
port 15 per cent was being paid on her.
From here she went to Mare Island and
began discharging at the navy-yard. v.â¢-
terday a tire broke out in the coal cargo
and considerable trouble was experienced
In extinguishing it. Had the vessel been
at sea the chances are that there would
have been another marine disaster.
The mail steamer Mariposa sails to
night for Sydney, N. S. W., via Honolulu,
Apia and Auckland. Captain Houdlctte.
late of the Australia, will take the ves
sel out, as captain Hayward leaves in a
few days for Philadelphia to superintend
the completion of the first of the new
steamers now building for the Oceanic
Steamship Company. This will be the
first voyage Captain Hay ward has missed
In the Mariposa in fifteen years. Beforo
going to Philadelphia ho will visit his old
home in Massachusetts.
Chief Engineer S. N. Haynes of the
Mariposa will also remain behind and go
to Philadelphia with Captain Hayward.
First Assistant Engineer E. Wolfe will go
out as chief this trip and a new first as
sistant will be appointed to-day.
The mails are on time, so the Mariposa
will get away promptly at R p. m. She
carries an unusually large cargo and a
full passenger list, a number of notable
Hawallans will go home on her. and Cap
tain McLeod, late of the ship James
Nesmlth. goes to Honolulu on her to take
command of the Henry B. Hyde.
The Pacific Mall Company's chartered
steamer Algoa was scheduled to arrive
from the Orient yesterday, but It will
probably be Friday or Saturday before she
makes port. She is an enormous big
tramp and makes very little pretensions
as to speed. She Is 7575 tons gross bur
den. 455 feet long, 5S feet beam and 23 feet
4 inches deep. Her carrying capacity Is
about 13,000 tons, and she has nearly that
amount of freight aboard for this port.
This Is more than twice as big a cargo
as has ever been brought Into San Fran
cisco In any one ship. An idea of the sizo
of the Algoa can be gained from the fact
that she Is 1800 tons gross burden larger
than the transport Sheridan, now at Po!
som street wharf. â¢
Coal is a very scarce commodity in the
market just now, so the advent of the
Louis Walsh -with 1800 tons from the Ro<j
lyn colliery was hailed with delight yes
terday. The Walsh was twenty days
making the run from Tacoma. and her
owners v.-ore beginning to worry over tho
long passage.
Tne Collector of the Port is about to
have erected a new district office on Mis
sion street wharf for the custom-house of
ficers. The improvement is being made
none too soon, as the old shack in which
the men have been compelled to work
does not deserve the name of "office."
The revenue cutter Rush lost one of her
boats last week. The general supposition
was that It broke away from the boom
and drifted out to sea. Yesterday the
cutter made a short cruise around the bay
and out to sea in search of the miss
boat, but no trace of It could be found.
The California Shipping Company has
purchased another sailing vessel, "i ester
day W. E. Mlghell secured the ship Will
iam H. Smith, now on her way from New
York for Hongkong. The Smith Is a first
class ship and will prove a welcome ad
dition to the coast fleet. The Berlin has
also been purchased for the coast trade
by George E. Plummer. Both vessels will
arrive lure during next year.
Edward : Lewis, a man 70 years of
age. attempted suicide on the front yes
terday. He Jumped overboard from the
Clay street wharf, but was rescued end
taken to the Harbor Hospital, where he
was attended to by Dr. Robinson.
In the Drvorce Court.
Alblna Biemann hns been granted a :!i
voce from Gustav A. F. Siemann on the
ground of desertion. Decrees of divorce
have also been granted Theresa Cuche
from Frederick H. Cuche on the ground
of extreme cruelty and James E. Baker
from LlKte C. Baker on the ground of
desertion. Mary Roberts has sued Ennis
Roberts for a divorce alleging desertion
as a cause cf action.

IV. THREE LESSONS IN PEN
MANSHIP.
BY C. P. ZANER.
People write illrgiljly, not so much from
Lack of skill as from lack of attention to
details. The illustration of "common er
rors" discloses this. The writer, thourrh
skilled, was careles* about forming or fin
ishing certain letters. No more skill was
needed to make the words plain, but a
little more attention, care or time. Look
over your own hand and see if you will
not discover similar causes of Illegibility
or doubtfulness. If, after you ha\ â¢
covered them, they do not disapp. ir It
means that you are not in earnest at Jut .
Improving your penmanship.
Figures are more important than Wt^rs.
They Itmnd alone. They are not rHafd '
one to another like letters In wordi
cannot therefore be read or deciphered by
context, as letters sonvtlm^s can. A mis
take in figures la usually fur ri:
than in spelling. You will do well to cul-
tlvate the habit of absolute surcness In
figures. And. by the way. writing, after
all, Ik nothing more or less than habit. It
Is nearly as much ho as walking, talking,
etc. Once learned well. It la a pleasant and
profitable servant all through life. Now is
the opportune time to Improve that which
you have failed to learn as well as you
should. "What Is worth doing is worth
doing wey" is as true of writing as of
anything else.
It matters but Httlo which way yrur
writing f"l< â¢;Â»Â»-?Â«. whether forward m

a circular ror Austtull.-i nays: "Since the
steamer Alameda left there has not N-.^n a
delivery made here of colonial coal; the last ar
rival was the invern*iii. over .*ix weeks since.
The writer does not remember a similar occur
rence during his experience In this line. There
is due to arrive her* by thÂ« end of February
about 20.000 tons from Newcastle and Sydney
all of which goes direct to consumers, having
l^en sold to them some months a*o, at prices
that would now leave the purchasers a hand
some profll in case of reaall, There are twen
ty-one vessels reported chartered to load coal
In Australia for San Francisco, with about
6..000 tons capacity, whereas there are fifty
seven chartered for Honolulu, with IU.OUB tons
I It li this latter business which has eaten Into
. our colonial trade, and ha* carried off all our
available coal tonnage, with no appeanu of
nn early cessation. Over twenty shillings has
been ptld to Pan Francisco from Newcastle
ror early loading, and nineteen shillings for
! loading six mi runs henceâ twenty -thre- â hill-
I ings Ik the current rate for Honolulu. When
the American tariff fhall be adopted at the
Hawaiian Irlanda, then the fuel there will be
costly. The local outlook for any low-priced
coals in ]>Â« Is very <lJs.-.urairing; this Is prov-
Ing a material set-back to our factories, where
fuel forma the leading article In the monthly

duct to a market where quick sales and fair
profit are awaiting them"

Peanut Butter.
"Peanut butter is nnt a fad. but Is rap-
Idly becoming an Important commercial
product." Mild Charles H. Puncher of
Phlladelphlu ut lhÂ« National rect-p'ly.
"Peanut butter Is made by prlndlng pea
nuts very line and reducing the taut to n
pasty MilistaiH-.-. a portion, at leaat of
the Â»rma amount of oil contained being
removed. Some rait Is added for flavor-
Ing, and the result Is a cheap and nourish
ing â¢spread' for crackers or bread, the
nutritive value of which Is now recognized
by many physicians. Nuts have always
been known to contain fat and strenstli
glvlnK elements. but the general reputa
tion that they enjoy for being Indigestible
and not adapted as a food results from
the way In which they are usually taken
Into the stomach.
"Half-chewed nuts of any kind are nm
readily attacked by the digestive fluids,
but when reduced to a paste they are
somewhat dry. and when taken Into -the
mouth almost demand an effort In raising
Rumcient saliva before swallowing. It Is
right here that physicians hold the value
of this kind of food lies. Foods that are
easily swallowed are seldom properly
masticated, and as preventives of Indiges
tion those that require a large supply of
saliva arc by far the best. Another value
added to peanut butter Is Its absolute pur
ity, there being no likelihood of germs, as
In the case of butter made from cream
and, moreover, the product Is an excellent
one for the poor. In that It can be made at
a fraction of the expense of cream butter
The industry Is growing rapidly, and pea
nut butter Is extensively used In the lance
cities to-day.â Washington Post.

has been known that Chin- se regularly frequented the.so

J. H. Neal, "that opium is relr.g sold or smoked by our
girls I would not. wait for any ordinance to be passed,
but would at once start out with a gun and do tome
shooting myseit. If any girls were being enticed into
Chinese houses 1 would instantly start out to level such
places with the ground. 1 am by no means satl ifled, bow
ever, that such a condition â  prevails. We have one or
two opium fiends In town, but we have an ordinance !n
force that fully covers the case. If It be not enforced
the Trustees will attend to It."
The Pleasanton ordinance Is as follows:
Sec 4. No peraon shall in the tewn of I'leasanton own or
keep or maintain or manage, pr smoke opium at, or become an
inmate of. or visit or resort to, for the purpose of smoking
opium, or In any way contribute to the support of any house or
room or place where opium Is smoked, or where persons assem
ble for the purpewe of smoking opium or inhaling the fumes of
opium.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section
â¢hall lxÂ» deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
or a plea of guilty thereof shall be punished by a fine of not
less than twenty dollars (S3O), nor more than one hundred dollars
iJlOO) or by imprisonment net exceeding thirty clays, or by
both such line anil Imprisonment.
The most positive Information concerning the visits
of white girls tj the opium dens is that supplied by
Charley Qwon?, the cook of the Rose Hotel, who says
he saw a girl not more than 14 years old coming out
of the place with opium, which she had obtained for
medicine.
The Board of Health has already declared that the
presence of th- Chine-.. in the center of the town Is a
menace to the health of the town and the Board of Trut;
tecs has been petitioned to order their removal. Th
petition asks that no laundry or washhouse be permitted
within 400 feet of the main street.
PITTSBURG AGAINST
CHANGING OF RATES
HAYDEN TXLLS OF VIEWS OF
Braco Haydn of New York Is in the
city. He Is the New York member of
Dunham. Carrlgan & Ha/den. Recently i
be baa been Interviewing Eastern business
men and manufacturers concerning the i
proceedings to take place in this city be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commission.
He makes the very interesting statement
that business men of the Atlantic coast
see in the propositions made by the St. j
Louis Jobbers a threat of danger to them- .
selves In a direction that has not been '
previously mentioned.
"The Eastern business men and manu
facturers with whom 1 have talked," said
Mr. Hayden, "sco clearly that If the rates ;
for the moving of freight to the Pacific
coast are graded so that they are lower'
from St. Louis than from Chicago and \
cheaper from Chicago than from Atlantic
seaboard points to this coast . they will
be at a decided disadvantage in doing
business In California, Washington and
Oregon. But they also think that If the
Middle West manufacturer and Joober is
built up the business of the Middle West
will also bo lost to the Atlantic coast.
Consequently they cannot afford to assist
In building up rivals in the Middle West.
I presented the facts concerning the grad
ed rates to the Manufacturers 1^ and Mer
chants' Association of Philadelphia and
they adopted resolutions opposing the pro
posed rate grading. The question of dif
ferentials in M simple that there was no
necessity for talking about it. Anyone can
see that it is absurd to expect the trans
portation companies to move freight by
the handful at as cheap rates as Dy the
unbroken carload. I talked with manu
facturers and merchants In New York and
Plusburg also. The Pittsburg people see
that they are largely concerned. 1 think
that when the Interstate Commerce Com
mission sits In Washington to hear the re
buttal testimony in this case, Pittsburg
Philadelphia, New York and other large
Eastern centers of business may ask to
be heard."
There Is a general belief In this city that
the Interstate Commerce Commission will
be here next month. The understanding
was, whon the commission took a -recess
at St. Louis, that the hearing would be re
sumed here about the middle of January
unless notice was sent to the contrary In
the meantime. All the preparations for
the local j hearing are progressing. Last
night Wakefleld Baker, President, and II
D. Loveland. traffic manager, of the Pa
cln> Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association, went to Los Angeles in con
nection v.-'th the homing to take place.

the ground of fraud. Mr" McNevin had
represented that she and her husband
were "making a barrel of money out of

reason for selling was the fact that her

DE PACHMANN S
FIRST RECITAL
WHEN De Pachmann was hero
nine years ago he did not onco
muster such an audienco as that
which filled the California Thea
ter yesterday afternoon. This Is due In
part to the fact that San Francisco has
known a musical awakening and also to
the fart that De Pachmann's fame has
widened very considerably. We wcro
therefore prepared to greet him this tlmo
as one of the truly great and we we.ro noc
disappointed. One also looked, I think,
for I certain sobering of his eccentric
personality, but in this respect there 1.-i
no change. ' There Is still the odd man
nerisms, still the smile and the nod of tho
head. De Pachmann If given Irretrieva
bly, 1 fear, to playfulness, although thero
is something In the way that he flirt*
with the piano that makes it quite for
givable. Ills grntesqueri. are tempered
with sincerity and behind It all Is such
an authority, such musicianship that ono
would be a earlier Indeed to Mnd fault.
The little Russian is an artist of strong
individuality, and if not capable of stir
ring the soul to its nethermost depths
there is a thrill In his playing that be
speaks the noet. Thero were few con
cessions to popularity In the programme
which began with a Weber sonata. Op. 3D
and it was fairly finished before the hou.Â«a
warmed up to the occasion. In the fol
lowing number, Schumann's I'hantast.
stuecke Op. 12. the first Item. irum "
was played with magnetism and a fine
expressiveness. The familiar "Vogtl at*
Prophet" was read In an equally Inter
eating manner and la the "Jagdlled"
which followed there was purpose and
abundant color. After the "Rondo Ca
pried tMiTiilfNs<>hn-lurtMi.ii> Mr. do
Pachmann responded to an encore with 4
strikingly original rendering of Chopin*
black note etude. It was to the Chopin
numbers in particular that the audlvncu
looked forward, the powers of De Pach
mann as an Interpreter of the melancholy
Pole being generally accepted.
Three prelude* were given with dis
tinction and three etudes In a suggestive
and eminently tasteful manner. ThÂ«> Ma
zurka, Op. 33. No. 4. was read with much,
charm an.l freedom and a nicely calcu
lated use of rubato. In thin we hud aguln
the suggestive quality of De Pachmann's
playing which makes it so Interesting.
The Vatao lirilllante. Op. 31. No. 1. was
not so gracefully interpreted' as I â¢ x!â¢â¢<:
ed and -â¢'..m.'l somewhat deficient la
rhythm. â â 'Ââ â 
The recital ended with the difficult
Third Schorzo, which was srlvcn with
commendable "clarity and vlror. There
was a final and imperative demand for
an encore and another Chopin waits w.i.-,
given. There are to be two more rtrclt
als on Thursday and Friday afternoons.

PKOTEST IS OVEHRUXED.
Decision Affecting Merchandise Re
ceived at This Port and In
tended for Export.
Customs Co. tor Jackson yesterday
received a letter from O. L. Spauldlng,
Assistant' Secretary of the Treasury, over
ruling the protest lodged by the Southern
Pacific Company against the recent de
cision of the department referring to the
transportation of merchandise received at
this port In transit for export. The de
cision provides that when merchandise ar
riving from a foreign port Is shown to
be destined for export to countries other
than Mexico or Canada, entry for ware
house and transportation to the port of
export Is required. The act of June 10.
1880, which It was claimed covered the
Importation of goods Intended for export.
Is neld to have no bearing on the. matter
under discussion.
The assistant secretary says the diffi
culties complained of may be obviated,
however. If the papers accompanying
such shipments are made to Indicate that
the goods consigned to this port are en
tered here for exportation, subject, of
course, to the appraisement required un
der existing laws. In consideration of the
fact, however, that an abrupt termination
of the prlvlllge. which has the Implied
sanction of the department, would greatly
Injure shippers, the Collector is directed
to limit, until further notice, the Identifi
cation of such goods to the marks and
number a on the invoices and manifests
thereof. '.'"'.â â¢

Hospital after on amputation of his leg.
ised was a native of Pola;

13YINGTON HOLDS OUT.
Will Not Accede to Demands
of the OrganTzation.
Publication of the stor>' of his row with
the Democratic "organization" has not
swerved District Attorney Bytngton In
Ills determination to stand out against the
demands of the McNab combination
as to the deposition or the patronage
of his ofllce. He said yesterday that his
were the appointments and that hÂ« WOUld
insist upon having the making of them,
even at some cost. That Is us far n.s Mr.
Bylngton will go. however; he will not
embarrass the Mayor or Mr. McNab by
making any recommendations as to the
disposition of the places which are pecul
iarly their own.
The Inside of the unpleasantness which
exists between the two factions came out
yesterday. It hinges principally upon the
insisted demands of Clan McXab
that William Alford be handed one
of liylngton's $2CuO Jobs. As was
Mated In yesterday's Cull, the lead
ers and the rt-M of the organization
have future usÂ© for the lawyer-states
man from Tulare, and they desire to
place him where he can \h- got at at a.
moments notice. liyington considers
Alfonl a rank outsider and that his ap
pointment would redound in no wl.se to
nls own political welfare. With that
conviction Mr. llyington has flatly de
clined to accede to the "â¢organization's"
demands and has named Johnny Ureancy
lor the dlrputed place.
The objections of the organization to
<iroaney date back to the last general
election, when Greaney flew the [)< tno-
Cratlc coop and went into District Attor
ney Murpny's light against Barclay Hen
ley. Henley nnd Greaney fought each
other In lsj>4 tor the Democratic nomina
tion for District Attorney; Qreancy won
and Henley, disgruntled, went over t<Â»
the Non-partisan* and g.t the nomination.
His fiction resulted in ho splitting thÂ«
Democratic vote that Greaney was de
feated and he evened up matters i! th.>
List eWtion by taking up Murphy's light
against Henley. Now the â¢'organization'"
Myu CJreaney is v renegade and several
other nice things and Byington says he
does not care a "sous marquis" if he is
lie proposes to np|Miint him anyway.
"Â»'' "organization has also demanded
a hecond place of Hylngton and named 1,
"Kauntleroy" JÂ» nks for the Job. Hying
ton. however, bus named Charlie Weller
and now the organization says Weller is
a bona tide resident of Alameda nnd cann
ot hold a Job In this city if he gets it
Notwithstanding the determined stand
tnken by Hyington the elan McNab and
Its connections are determined to break
the haughty Hyington pride and they
swear that the Tulnre tenderfoot will Inn'd
In his Job If It takes another election to
i do it.
GASOLINE GAS WRECKS
A KNIFE-GRINDER'S RIG
THERE was an explosion on Ste
venson street yesterday mom
ins in the rear of Hoffman &
Woenne's meat market and
sausage factory, and the flrst lmprcs
cion of thoso In the neighborhood was
that the covering of a bologna ha 1
succumbed to too much Internal pres
sure. The cause was not of such I
deadly nature. A gallon of gasoline
had blown up and wrecked Campinl &
Itascinl's scissors and knife grinding
machine, and incidentally seriously
damaged the wagon. The owners of
the rig haw long enjoyed a profitable
trade in grinding tools, etc., driving
their machine around town to the
places where their customers are lo
cated. The grindstone and emery
wheels were run by a gasoline motor
icsterday when the couple backed up
to the butcher shop and sausage fac
tory the etiKine had evidently not gjt
over the effects of the holidays, for
the valve that let out the gas was out
of order.
While KÂ»Â«=rini was gathering up an
armfu. of knives Campinl applied a
match to the place where the gas Is
generated. The flame flashed through

CITY'S FUTURE NOW
IN VOTERS' HANDS
Park Extension to Be Settled at
the Polls To-Day.
TO-DAY thÂ» voters of this city will
decide the question of the park
extensions scheme, which has been
fully exploited from both sides dur
ing the past two months. The friends and
opponents of the measure have ventilated
every possible argument and perhaps vo
ters never went to the polls better edu
cated on any matter upon which they have
been called to decide. Mayor Phelan has
headed the movement favorable to the ac
quirement of the proposed park and pan- '
handle extension and has several times â 
recently In public meetings expressed the
opinion that the measure will receive the â 
necessary two-thirds vote. The Mayor
has met every argument and has striven
to show that If the good name of the city
for progress is to be maintained it is ab
solutely necessary that a very positive
step be taken at once to lay the founda
tion of a new San Francisco.
The Public Improvements Central Club
has prepared . â  little pamphlet setting '
forth at a glance Just what are the facts
In connection with the panhandlo exten
sion. The situation Is thus summarized:
The voters will be called upon on Wednes
day to vote fur the purchase of twenty
throe Mocks of land to complete our park :
system, which will require â  tax of only
ii! tents on cnt-h JICO of v.->. B-t-.i property
for twenty years, when the city wiir own j
them free of debt.
tSolden Qate Park cost originally JSOO.OOO.
and la now worth JII.OCU.COO; Central Park.
New York, cost JS.OOO.OdU. and Is valued at
$200.0^1,000.
The propoâd purchase is a good Invest
ment lor the city, and Its Increased value

Interest and sinking fund. This la the mrst
fuvornblf time. It ever, _ to. make the la
vestment.
The : inda will connect the park with the
.city at the Junction of Market . street and
\an Ness avenue, accessible from all sec
tions, and brings our clty'B pleasure grounds
a mil.- and a . half nearer the .people.
Oolden Oate Park now begins nowhere, It '
is worthy of a proper entrance. Such an
approach will advertise It Â«n.i encourage
Its use by all. â¢/â¢ â¢
â¢ Four hundred houses will have to be built |
If these lands are purchased, which will

OVSTAV SCHNEE.
The last noonday meeting of the (iam
i palgn was held yesterday at the Fulton
] Iron Works. P. N. Wellfn addressed th
worklngmen and onco again showed how
greatly it would be to tin- advantage of
labor to support all.the bonds.
At the last meeting of the Eureka Val
ley and l".irk Land Tract Improvement
Club, held at Daniels Hall, resolutions
were adopted Indorsing the bonds for the
park panhandle, and all the members
pledged themselves to support all the
bonds".
The opinion Is freely expressed that the
1 rate of the panhandle proposition will to
a large extent determine the fate of the
school, sewer and hospital bonds, which
are to be voted upon next Friday. Should

lie on the table, and files, big black
flies, buss thickly around -it. The bed
on which the sick woman lies is dirty,
and the week-old stranger is swathed
In winding, foul-smelling clothes.
Mrs. Qalvin's sad plight is the nat
ural result of misfortune. Michael Gal
vin. the husband, worked in the rolling
mills and earned Ji 7.". per day. His
growing family made saving an Impos
sibility, and when sickness overcame
the head of the house, matters went
from bad to worse. To provide her
husband with doctor and medicine Mrs.
Galvln went out working by the day
But his illness was a long and wasting
one, and finally the poor woman, no
longer able to pay the doctor and the
druggist, allowed her husband to bo
taken to the City and County Hospital.
On the 14th of September Michael Cal
vin died. His funeral was delayed for
three days till his sorrowing wife could
manage to rai.se the wherewithal to
bury him. Three little Galvlns have
found a last resting place at Holy
Cross. Their i -.I-. was opened up and
their father buried on top of them. The
neighbors collected JS for the funeral
expenses, and with this meager sum
the widow managed to spare the city
the expense of Interring her poor hus
band.
Mrs. Oalvln, in spite of all her many
miseries, Is hopeful. She counts the
days until she may once more get
around and be able to work. And un
til thenâ lt's the rent that worries, and
the coal and the oilâ nothing else.

the park bonds not carry, it is nrguH
that the voters who favor progress will
not come out to the polls again and that,
therefore, the whole scheme of improve
ments will fall to the ground. This fear
has caused the Mayor to state frequently
that it Is the duty of all who have the
host Interests of the city at heart to vote
for parks to-day and for schools, sewers
and the hospital next Friday.
Closing Meetings.
Closing meetings to discuss the bond
election were held last night at Garibaldi
Hall on Broadway and at Tcutonia Flail
on Howard street. At both meetings there
was a good attendance of interested
listeners who paid particular attention to
the remarks of the speaker Mayor
Phelan's remarks were to the point and
carried conviction to those present He
was followed by P. H. McCarthy, presi
dent of the Building Trades Council, who
showed to the workinginon the great ad
vantage that tlr- expenditure of the mil
lions of dollars to be secured by the Issu
ance of the bonds would be to all. C F
1 Sweigert In a masterly address explained
the necessity of San Francisco awakening
from Its lethargy of pioneer days ami
coming to the front as a modern munici
pality, having good struts, good sewers,
good school houses and Improved parks
and boulevards leading Into the parks
William Fahey caught the sentiments
I of the audience In his remarks, and before
he Ished it was evident that he struck
a responsive chord in the minds of every
mail present So truthfully did he por
tray the advantages to the city and its
people that he was called to the front of
the platform three times to receive the
applause of. those. who were captured by
his address. The same speakers* appeared
at both halls.
A mass meeting was held -at Teutonic
If all last night under the auspices of the
Thlrty-flrst District Improvement Club
T. K. Treacy was chairman and Charles
H. McQreery secretary. The meeting was
very enthusiastic The following speak

A Few Trite Facts.
SAN FRANCISCO, December 28. IKB
To the Editor oj Urn Call Sir: 1 take it for
I granted that upon the morn of an Important
â â  election it Is the proper time i,. lay a few ;
trite fact* before the people; that Is to say !
Ideas coming from the people, as It were. '
The election of to-morrow will tell us wheth
er, our city Is to enter the new century as a'
paragon of greta or still remain in the tolls '
of the Silurian.
I lielleve In the Intelligence and good Judg
ment of the voters of Pan 'Francisco, and there
fore predict a heavy vote for the Issuance of
bonds at both of the coming election*
The completion of ! the. Park Panhandle as
contemplated would be of Inestimable benefit
to the Industrial classes, while It would en
hance property values nearly tenfold for a
radius Of miles. The experience of other cities
stand before us as object lessons. Let the peo
ple have breathing room and It will tÂ»Â» found
that the cost of making- such room will be In
slpnlllcant as Compared with the benefits
i brought about.
Hear la mind the fact that the laborer and
I the poor man will not hare to pay for the
proposed Improvements. Labor Is to reap a
! harvest In consequence. Property must pay
for them and the bis corporations will have to
bear most of the burden. Spring Valley, the
gas on.l electric companies anil the railroad*
will contribute tlielr proper pro rata toward
beautifying and ltiprovlns the hygienic condi
ADVEBTISEMENTS.
