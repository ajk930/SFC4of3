PROTEST AGAiNST
THE FRENCH TREATY
California Representatives Declare
That the Interests of the State
Have Been Sacrificed.
WASHINGTON*. I). C. Dec. ;.â Senator
r<-rk!ns :Â».nd I'.fpr-.^entatlves Needham
and Waters held a conference this after
noon afiÂ«r hearing the terms of the new
reciprocity treaty with France negotiated
by Mr. Kasson during the recess. They
decided to call on tho President on Sat
urday to remonstrate against those feat
vires of the conventions which operate
:icainÂ«t California producers. The treaty
mmkej radical reductions on olive oil. liq
uors, preserves, prepare/1 fruits, seeds
and nuts. The treaty also accords to i
French sparkling win*-* tho same term*
as other countries now have. Senator
Perkins considers that the. interests of
California have 1m tv Â»a<ri!scr?d more than
tny other section of the country and at
the same time realizes that Mr. Kasson
negotiated the treaty with the full ap
proval of tho Secretary of State and oth
er members of the Cabinet. There Is
hardly a doubt that if the administration
was W-hind Mr. Kas*on during his nc^o
tiiiUnns tho treaty will be ratl!>d by the j

however, make an earnest tight against '

DEPARTMENT ADMITS
WAR IS FAR FROM OVER
Scattered Bands of Filipinos a Seri
ous Menace to the American
Troops.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-Though the
rampa gn in the Philippines ha, demon
tn.t.-d that the American troo-w can
march from one end of the island of
Luzon to the other without serious oppo
sition, military and naval experts arc :
satisfied that The Call-Herald's dis
patcher from Manila showing that the i
end of the insurrection is not yet In sight
correctly state the situation.
Officially Secretary Root and Adjutant
General Corbin declare their confidence
in General Otis 1 ability to early crush- i
th- rebellion, and they nre highly pleased '
at the remarkable exhibition of pluck and '
endurance which the American troop*
have shown. Secretary Root said to
mÂ« this afternoon that he believes General
Otis is making excellent progress in the
work of restoring peace and order to the
I nlllpplnes. "General Otis has stated
condition n.-. they exl.n." said Genera! !
Corotn this afternoon. "I an satistied
that th- insurrection will be speedily sup
pressed."
Vet it Is apparent that General Otis still
baa a Rood deal of work to perform be
fore his task of restoring peace Is ac
cnmpli.hM A dispatch from General
Otis yesterday announced an attack on
the town <.f Vlgan by 800 insurgents, who
were driven off by Lieutenant Colonel
I urker Â» command and who intrenched
themselves outside the town.
Â«i-n*ral Otis reported this afternoon the
arrival of General Young at vi Ran after
an encounter with insurgent, i welv Â«
miles below that point, and it is we-
r U !T ci that the arrival Â° f General Young
caused the insurgents to leave precipi
tately m view of the fact that no fight
ing M reported. However, the attack
made by the insurgents Indicates to some
Of our officials that although the Filipinos
have been driven in even' direction i.y
the American troops, their spirit has
not yet gone and they are willing to fight
when they think the odds are In their
favor. Nothing is known here, it la ad
mitted, as to the whereabouts of Aguln
aMo. When last heard from ho was in
the vicinity of Bangued. but General
Young la now some distance behind and It
Is apparent that the Filipino leader has
escaped for the present at least. In ad
dition to the Insurgents who have been
pursued to the north of Luzon. General
Otis will have to send troops to operate
against those entrenched in Cavlte
province, which has been considered
Aguinaldo's stronghold. Expeditions
have operated In this province, driving
and scattering the Insurgents with the
snme ease thai Generals Lawton and
Mac Arthur have In the north, though the
latter have captured many prisoners,
munitions of war and other supplies. In
a dispatch to the department to-day Gen
eral Otis states that "to tho south of
Manila the insurgents still maintain their
positions. The necessary force to scatter
them â will be sent there soon."
It Is presumed that General Otis is
awaiting the arrival of additional troops
before commencing operations to the
Houth of Manila. He also announces an

KIMBERLEY, Monday. Dec. 4.â Everything has been quiet here during the last three days.
The theater and the convent have been fitted up as hospitals. A number of British cattle have
been captured by the Boers.
NEW YO3K, Dec. 8. â A cable to the Sun from Lourenzo Marquez, dated December 2. says: An official
dispatch from Pretoria, dated December 1, says: "Our forces at Colenso have taken a position on this side of
the Tugela Biver. The enemy is on the opposite side within cannon shot. All is quiet at Colenso and Lady
smith.
"Mafeking was bombarded yesterday. There was a slight response from one Maxim gun. WessÂ°ls advises
the Government that he arrived at Kimberl-y on the morning of November 20, bound for Bloemhof. The Boer
contingent had repulsed the British on November 28 and regained their old position. The Boer losses were
three killed and ten wounded.
*<It is officially announced from Bloemfontein that the British were repulsed with great loss at Modder

tually crosses he will find the Boen

To be sure, rumors of dissension be
tween the Transvaalers and Free Staters
multiply. General Cronje, It la said. in
sists on putting Boer officers over the
Free State forces confronting Ifethuen,
and declares that the latter will not fight.'
The continuance of the campaign w!U
subject the alliance between the two re
publics to considerable strain. It ap
pears to have done so already In Natal.
Rumors are again at hand that large
forces of the enemy are beginning to
move from smith .toward Dras:ena
burg passes, which peems likely, if the
Orange State burghers are not only dis
inclined to enter battle but anxious for
the security of their homes. General
Schalkberger will not have an easy task
to keep White within his intrenchmÂ«nts
should his allies begin to desert him.
The Boers have some heavy guns
mounted to defend the approach to Lady
smith. but General Boner, it is known,
has greatly strengthened this important
arm of his column.
From the west also i cornea cheering
news. The sortie from Kimherlev on No
vember 2* proves that the besieged are
able to cope with the Boers whenever
they feel Inclined, help the flying column,
and can force their way almost r to Spy t
fontrln ami Scholtz Knpf.
General Methuen has resumed command
of his troops at Bfodder River. News that
the engineers are building their bridge
rapidly Is taken to mean that the railway
bridge Is being repaired for the passage
of naval* guns. The Boers an said to be
at Spytfonteln with 11.000 men well in
trenched and supported by powerful ar
tillery, with all the ranges measured. It
Is stated that the Boers are hurrying
from Natal and 3000 are said to have al
ready reached Spytfonteln. While this
report needs much confirmation. It shows
the great danger of General Methuen's
advance so long as the attention of the
Boers Is not fully occupied In Natal.'
The gravest risk, unquestionably. Is to
the long and exposed line of communica
tions which link the Ifodder River and
Klmberley with Do Aar. It Is clear that
General Gatacre is having â  good deal
of difficulty In the north of Cape Colony.
Ills main body was at Putters Kraal sev
eral days ago. and It was hoped that he
would soon Join hands with General
French from Naauwpoort and sweep th-:
invaders before him, but the whole of
this region is ablaze with disaffection and
revolt. A rising Is Imminent in Griqua
land East. The Boers have entered Dord
recht and are advancing to meet Gatacre,
who Is still at Fetters Kraal waiting re
inforcements, with the object of getting
possession j of; the railway between
Queenstown and Moltena and thus pro
venting his Junction with French.
This activity- of tho Boers Is quite un
expected by the British. General,
SILENT PRAYER AND
A MOST TRAGIC DEATH
"Divine Healer" Stays a Blow and His
Assailant Expires.
Haated Discussion on Religion by Two Aged
Men Has a Decidediy Sensational
Climax.
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 7.â Malachi Dwyer. an old man of 68
years, met with a most tragic death in the public library
this afternoon. He had been engaged in a discussion of
religous questions with J. S. Charlebois. a fanatic who is
known as a "divine healer.'* and editor of a paper called 'The
Living Truth." Both men have been Catholics and religious en
thusiasts, and have long frequented the library and read all
kinds of literature in their search fcr the truth.
Recently Charlebois declared that he had started out as a
divine healer with considerable success. To-day when the two
men met in the library Charlebois asked Dwyer what he thought
of some of his writings- and Dwyer ridiculed them. A discus
sion followed, in which the haaler tried to convince Dwyer that
he had found the real thing, and durinc his taik he marie some
remark about the Pope which offended Dwyer. Then the latter
got up and walked toward the healer with an upraised and
clinched fist- as if to strike him.
Charlebois feared Dwyer. and as he afterward explained,
he called silently on God to protect him and stay the hand of
Dwyefi and as he breathed the prayer Dwyer staggered back
ward and fell dead to the floor.
There were a number of witnesses to the tragic death. The
bedy was removed to the Morgue, where it was examined by
physicians, who discovered thai death resulted from heart dis
ease. The healer has been detained as a witness to testify at
a Coroner's inquest to-morrow.

that th? member from Utah pleaded rullty to

It i- tru^ that the Representative from Utah

the Mormon people a wave of popular sentiment,

that Utah has broken her compact with the

mous n.Hrr^aces; that the seating of Utah's

nnd would be a menace to the American home.

Icy. under sentence to be hanged at Hoi
brook to-morrow for the murder of Peter
M .-.in y. has been -(ranted a reprieve
of thirty days by Governor Murphy. In
Mi proclamation the Governor states that
"thero are strong reasons why the exe
cution should- be delayed."
The main reason, though, why It has
been delayed Is revulsion of sentiment
acalnsi trie conduct of Sheriff Wattron
of Navajo County, who has sent out in
vitations to the execution, which he says
will be conducted according to the "lat
Â»st art of strangulation," and ho further
promises that arrangements . have been
ordered so as to make Smyley's working
off as "cheerful as possible."
The respite is intended to be a rebuke
to this sort of flippancy calculated to
cloud thÂ« dignity and solemnity of judi
cial proceodlnKS in Arizona.

men have been elected to offices of high honor

such charges were made by affidavit were ap
pointed to Federal offices In the State, not

I submit to you the question whether It la
worth while for your Representatives in the

safeguards which protect both the rights of In
dividuals and the rights of the States, which
course menaces representative government In
the State itÃ..|f. I ask If It Is worth while to
countenance procedure Involving dangers herein
set forth. In order to reach one man chargexl
with a misdemeanor under the laws of his own
State and which Is in the eye of the law an
offense so slight that under rights guaranteed
to him and hi* constituents he could not be ar

the object of the popular clamor to-day; may It

constitution and the laws from the frenzy of
popular fury, set on fire by falsehood and dls- ''
tortlon, what guarantee have we that any one'Â»
rights are secure" And Is It true that this mob

should be the sacred precincts of the House of

CALIFORNIA'S EARLY DAYS
Queen Alma Cutter of the Golden Jubilee Celebration and Maids of
Honor.
THE celebration of the fiftieth anni
versary of the inauguration of the
State government In California
shortly to be held at Ban Jose
promises to be one of thÂ«. moat
Interesting events that has taken
7>lace In the Garden City for many years
To the younger generation It will be a
demonstration of the "good o'.d days" of
which so much has been told; to the
older ones It will recall the stormy pe
riods through which they passed whi>
*.h<Â« State was young 1 and comparatively
unsettled.
The celebration will bring together
more pioneers than have ever met at one
plaeo In many years, and Incidentally a
number of Native Sans will %iave an op
portunity to nÂ»vt and mingle with the
father? of the State. Perhaps the most
' lntrrrstlnp feature will be an exact rep
resentation of the Inauguration of the
first Governor. Everything will be ar
rai.p^d as nearly as possible as It was
on '.hat memorable day. and a number of
:V.is* who participated In the exercises
nlil bf present and occupy their old seats.
The festivities will open on the -"Oth.

TAYLOR WILL
BE GOVERNOR
Probable Decision of the
Election Board
â¢ n
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Dec. ".-The deri
sion of the State Board of Election Com
missioners covering the gubernatorial con
test tv ill be handed down on Saturday
| morning. The strong probability is that
' certificates of election will be given to
â  William S. Taylor, the Republican can
: dldate for Governor, and to the other Re
j publican candidates for other offices on
: the State ticket. The vote will probably
! be two for the Republican and one for the
j Democratic State ticket.
It was thought when the board ad
journed at noon, after the conclusion of
Judge Harpis' argument, that two of the
members of the board had practically
decided to vote for Taylor and that they
wished to spend the time between the ad
journment of court and the time set for
the reading of the opinion In preparing a
syllabus of the decision they had decided
to render. The three members of the com
mission have been placed In a most un
enviable position. Their best friends, even
their relatives, have pleaded with them on
both sides of the -questionâ some for Tay
lor, some for Qoelx No matter which
way they decide the case, it means much
to thtlr friends. The pressure against
them has bofh something stupendous, and
it is only fair to say that throughout the
entire canvuss nd during the one and a
half days of argument they seemed act
uated only by the intention to do their
duly as they understand it and to render
Justice where they consider it due.
There is no doubt the pressure brought
to bear upon them so far will he continued
until they have handed down the certl
licate of election on Saturday. It is pos
sible that ore or thÂ» other of the throe
members of the board may alter his posi
tion and stand for Goebel. but it is not
considered likely, and The chances now
are that the conditions prevailing to-night
will endure to the end and that the cer
tilicates will be handed down to William
S. Taylor and his colleairues on Saturday.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.â Routine pro
ceedings of the Senate to-day were en
livened by a colloquy between Chandler
of New Hampshire and Hale of Maine
over a bill introduced by the former to
promote athletic sports at the military
academy at West Point and the naval
academy at Annapolis. Both Senators be
came facetious and at times sarcastic
over the growth of athletics at American
colleges and Chandler advanced the prop
osition that thÂ« cultivation of football and
similar ,â â  at the Government acade
my ought to be given the sanction of law.
The S ( "ate will hold no further s< tslons

Mm. Benatdt !>â ;>â¢ w :< to deliver the
oration ujH>n the occasion.
Chandler of New Hampshire offered
resolutions Instructing the Committee on
Privileges and Elections to investigate the
right of William A. Clark of Montana
and Nathan B. Scott of West Virginia to
beats in the Senate and to take testimony.
The resolutions were offered to the Cum
mittee on Contingent Expenses.
Berry of Arks offered a Joint reso
lution in favor of the election of united
States Senators by the people, and gave
notice that at a later date he would ad
dress the Senate upon the subject.
The bill offered by Chandler to increase
the efficiency of physical training at West
Point and Annapolis academies and to
pay less attention to the higher mental
training, according to itÂ» title, is intended
"to Increase the etJiciency of the West
Point Military Academy and the Annap
olis Naval Academy and to qualify and
stimulate the American youth for actual
military service by table physical train
ing instead of excessive mental educa
tion." It provides that the course of in
struction at the academies shall dispense
with the study of higher mathematics and
foreign language and substitute a course
in athletics to embrace especially golf,
bicycling, footbnll and baseball. The bill
also provides for annual athletic contests
between the students of the military
acadrrnies at I'.oston. New York. Phila
delphia. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago,
St. Louis. Richmond, Atlanta. New Or
leans. Omaha and San Francisco, at
which suitable prizes shall be awarded.
An apprspriatlon sufficient to pay the
prizes is provided for. but the railroads
nre required to carry free the cadets to
the places of contests and also the rep
resentatives of such reputable newspapers
as the Secretaries of War and Navy may
designate.
Chandlor asked that the measure be re
ferred to the Committee on Education and
Labor.
Hale took it. he said, to be a bill to
encourage football and other similar
p.-inr-s and he could hardly stand as spon
sor for such a proposition.
In a facetious speech Chandler replied
that he thought athletic contests among
thÂ« college men ought ro be uroura^d.
"The proposition I present Is." he said,
"that the athletic contests shall be regu
lated by law, and that international and
intercollegiate contests shall occur at
stated points. Free trains shall be run
by the railroads to these affairs, in or
der to Increase the Interest and attend
ance, and I propose that this shall be
done without violating the Interstate
commerce law."
The Mil was referred as desired by
Chandler.
Among other bills and joint resolutions
of the day were the following:
By Formker -To Increase to 5100 per
month the pension of Nellie Young Eg
bert, widow of the late Colonel Henry
Clay Egbert of the Twenty-second In
fantry, who was killed In the Philippine
war.
By Harrisâ Joint c ilution providing
for "the limitation of time a President shall
be elected to one term of six years a.Td
making the terms of members of the
House four years.
By Stewartâ A bill appropriating 1175,000
for the purchase of the submarine torpedo
boat Holland.
By Harrisâ A bill granting pensions to
persons who served In the Confederate
service and afterward in the army and
navy of the United States.
At 12:30 p. m. the Senate went into ex
ecutive â â¢jesslon and at 1:05 p. m. adjourned
until Monday.

READING, Pa,, Dec. 7.â One of the

ited this city occurred to-day, when the
extensive hosiery mill of the Nellie and

plant, causing the death of one person
and Injuring fifty-seven other employes
of the company. What was at first sup
posed to be the bodies of two persons
proved to-night to bo the separated parts
of 'one body. It is that of Miss Louisa
Clay, aged 4S years, who was the only
person killed. All the other employes

REED'S LEGACY
TO A STRANGER
Â»
Suspected That He Led
a Dual Life.
Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RAN RAFAEL. Dee The passing' of
John J. Reed, the. wealthy rancher, known
to every pioneer of Marin as "the man
without an enemy." will evidently result
in a legal entanglement strengthening the
biblical theory that it Is a good thing not
to let the right hand become too familiar
with the deeds of thÂ« left. Reed's will was
opened to-day by City Attorney Boyd In
the presence of his family ami the execu
tor. Justo Vldal, and a thing or two wan
revealed by the pages of the document
that struck the members of the rancher's
household dumb with amazement. Accord
ing to the terms of the will. Reed be
queathed the residue of his estate, valued
at about $50,000. to Elvira Cora de Garcia,
described as the "six-year-old daughter of
Frances Cora Laurece de Garcia, now re
siding in San Francisco."
The largest parcel of real estate includ
ed in the legacy is the El Campo property,
so widely known an a picnic resort, which
is probably worth J25.000.
None of the deceased rancher's family
knows who is the child to whom this
property is bequeathed, or why It was be
stowed upon her. Visions of the rancher
having led a dual life, and other uncom
fortable mental pictures, have suggested
themselves to Reed's widow, daughter
and son. with the result that if the ranch
er could be resurrected from the dead, h<s
would be the head of a family divided

a dash for the tire escape and thÂ«Â» stairs,
but found that the latter meat of escape

appealed to those in the street to pave
them. Ladders were brought Into use and
many girls were taken from the burning
building safely. Most of then, however,
; jumped and were seriously injured. For a
few minutes from every window on the
second and third floors girls leaped on..

of those below, but many struck the
ground. They were picked up and rapidly
removed to hospitals or their houses.
Many of the girls who escaped by thÂ«
stairways and fire escapes were badly
burned, but none of them, it Is believed,

Miss Clay met her fate, but It is believed

because of the fact that the screens in the

were â¢i the building.

FORCES IN CUBA WILL
BE GREATLY REDUCED
General Wood to Succeed General
Brooke as Military Governor
of the Island.
WASHINGTON, Dee, 7.-General Leon
ard Wood had a conference with the Sec
rotary <>f War to-day respecting his fu
ture. While neither of the principals had
anything to say for publication as to the
conclusions reached, it is gathered that
General Wood. Is to be the next Governor
of Cuba, succeeding Genera! Brooke, who
will return to the L'nlted States.
It If expected that the military force in
Cuba can be greatly reduced In the near
future, so that while General Wood, by
comma . the troop? remaining will be
a military Governor, there will be so little
WÂ» of the military establishment that his
office will be much more civil than mill
tar;/ in fact The reduction in force will
enable the War Department to withdraw
some or perhaps all of the general officers
of the regulars now in Cuba.

PEKING. Dec. 7.â Thâ¬ Governor of the

which in reality formulate the laws un
der which the athletics of the collegen
are controlled. The representative com-
Bmittees of the students will meet next
week and discuss as well as agree upon
the new regulation* to be ailopted. Both
the fuculty committees m 111 recommend
the cessation of the employment of East
ern reaches and the change In the hold
ing of the game. They will also advise
a shortening of the football season, the
big game to be played in.- time in the
middle of November.
The students* of both colleges nre much
excited over the new rchemc. especially
the matter of the employment of
coaches*. It is asserted thai the game
has not yet progressed sufficiently to dis
pense with the teachings of the Eastern
players and that the real incentive to
ward quick progress in the game is duo
to their presence.
President Wheeler of California was
seen last night and said that he had not
given the matter any thought as yet. It
is believed that President Jordan of Stan
ford Is in favor of the change. At pres
ent Professor Edwards of California la

Miller - Waller Combina ion
Ahead in the Six-Day
Bicycle Race.
Spwlal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.-The leaders In the
six-day bicycle nice at Madison s<ju.ire
Garden at midnight to-night were ITJb
miles ahead cf the record, made When In
dividual scores and almost continuous rla-
Ing were the rule. The fairest comparison
which would be made between the old
style, riding as Individuals, and the new
style of two riders alternating, Is that of
the Miller-Waller combination results
made this week as contrasted with the
result* obtained by Miller a year ago.
The Miller-Waller combination was in
miles ahead of Miller's record at n.id
r.lght.
McEachÂ«rn has developed a severe at
tack of tonsilitls and his physicians are
watching him carefully. Aside from this
he is rldjng very strongly and his tea:n Is
regarded* as a dangerous one to the lead
er*.
Miller paid to-night that the present race
would be ins last. He says he has hud
enough, whether "old style or new style." i
He said the sam* thing last year. vVil
ler took .â  more optimist view of the
new method of riding. '"Miller will like
the new style better before he ijets
through with the race." he said. "I like
this new method. I've been riding for tif
teen years now and I can go fifteen more
at this game."
Walthour's wife arrived at the Garden :
to-night from her home In Atlanta. â¢ ;>.
From a box she urged her husband on to
renewed efforts ana he rode better than
ever after her arrival. The general 'm
pression Is that there Is little doubt of
his maintenance of, his lead for the first
individual money.
At midnight the Miller-Waller combina
tion was .-till In the lead, with an advan
tage of one lap over the Maya-McJÂ£achern
pair. The midnight score:

BOXER TRIES
TO FEIGN A
KNOCKOUT
Referee McGinley Declares
the Vickers-Ryan Bout
"No Contest."
The second boxing exhibition of the
Columbia Athletic Club held last night
was lade up of four exciting bouts and
a fifth which was stopped by the referee.
Charles Vlckers, one of the principals in
this contest, tried his best to lose, but
his awkward attempts to pose as a de
feated ii). excited the derision of the
spectators aud he was hissed out of the
ring.
His bout with James Ryan was sched
uled 11 the principal event on the pro
gramme. The men hardly came together
when those In attendance saw that Vlck
ers was not fighting. 11 was clumsy,
falling repeatedly before he was hit and
showing none of the aggnsslveness which
has always marked his work. During the
intervals of rest he sat at If in a stupor.
The second round was of â¢he same char
acter as the rirst and the spectators were
on their feet yelling at Kererte M Qlnley
to cull all bets off.
He let the men box a email portion of |
the third round and seeing no change In
Vickers' tactics declared the bout "no
contest" and all bets off. , â¢ .'
Vickera In all his previous contests ha*
taken unlimited â *â  punishment"" without
flinching and 01. ly one construction could
lie placed on his actions last night. He
was obviously trying to lose. It was said,
in order to win money In the betting. He
was a poor faker, as he could not restrain
his laughter when he was down and time
was being counted on him.
ThÂ«; shortest bout of the evening was
between "Jack" Mom and Eugene Field.
The latter was knocked' out In one min
ute. Moss, WOO halls from Angels Camp.
but proved to be no angel, looks like Jef
fries. When. Field saw him In the ring'
be was attacked at once with stage fright.
When the bell sent them together Field
was loth to move, but Moss lost no time
getting into action. He chased Field
around the ring and after two circuits Of
the padded floor nailed him- in a corner.
It was â  me time before Fleid came to
ami wa.s assisted from the ring.
The boot between "Joe" Long and Char
llo Thurston lasted only five rounds.
Thurston punished his opponent badly In
the third and fourth rounds, but c*Â»uld
not stop him, Long was unwilling to
start In the fifth round, but hh? seconds
reed him to the center of the ring. 'He
fought gamely and took more punishment.
Tired nature refused to respond In the
next round, Long being unable to leave
his corner. The bout was awarded to
Thurston.
Kid Johnson nnd "Wes" Porter boxed
three fast rounds. Just before th.- finish
of the third round Port>-r was knocked ,
down and twisted his ankle out of place.
which ended his usefulness. .
The only bout to go the limit was be
tween "Kid" Finnorty and "Joe" (YLeary
Tho latter was tall and spidery and looked
anything but a boxer. He ha') a clever
chop blow which generally kept his stocky
opponent away from him. In the eighth
round the boys fought themselves to a
standstill and hnd no steam' In their
blows. The referee awarded the bout to
Flnnerty on points, although it could have
been a draw.
The gymnasium in which the bouts were
held was crowded to the doors.
GREENBERG SUES THE
OWNERS OF THE TRACK
Ifyman Qreenberg filed suit yesterday

FRENNA BECOMES
AFFLICTED WITH
LOSS Of MEMORY
Brain Suddenly Re-
fuses to Act.
NO LONGER RECALLS FACTS
FORGETS THE SHYLOCK BO-
NtJSES FROM TURNER.
Frenna was suffering yesterday from
a treacherous memory. He could not
recollect, except In a general way. ever j
having loaned any money to James F. ]
Turner during the years IBM and 1532. I
This sudden lapse was not entirely unex- '
seeted. but It was nevertheless a remark- !
able exhibition of the facility with which
the defendant's brain accommodates itself
to the circumstances Of the case. On the
two preceding days while he was being
questioned by his own attorneys on direct
examination the answers flowed from his
lips unhesitatingly and with great wealth
of detail as to dates and amounts of the
numerous transactions he had had with
Turner. He whs never for a moment in
doubt and seemed to have a perfect un
derstanding and memory of all that
passed between himself and the man he
killed from the day they tirst became ac
quainted down to the day of the tragedy
in the I'rocker building. But when As
sistant District Attorney Salomon began
( to cross-examine him yesterday morning
, his mind became a blank concerning all
, these financial transactions, especially
' tb ..se having a tendency to place him in
â  an unenviable light, and with but few un-
Important â¢ xceptlons the only answer ob
tainable was "I don"t remember," or "I
1 am not sure.
The few exceptions referred to were not
due to sudden Hashes of memory nor
were they productive of any information
of material Importance. In each and
every Instance when the witness tem
porarily forgot that he was not supposed
member anything and procoeded to
; answer a question in a manner that
threatened to throw some light on the
transaction under discussion Attorn*^
Hosmer was on his feet with an objection
which, certain to be overruled by the
court, was bo worded as to convey a plain
caution to the defendant witness to curb
his desire to talk. In fact once When
Frenna had Inadvertently answered a
question which his attorneys did not de
sire lntn to answer Hosmer actually ob
jected to the answer.
Hut all this wa_s in line with the plan
that is being followed by the defens â¢â  tO
Turn* is slayer from the conse
quences of I. is crime. Having secured a
full presentation of Frenna's version of
the manner m whk-h he had been robbed
' and bunkoed by Turner it is the business
; of hi* attorneys to prevent the Introduc
tion of any testimony tending to show
i that Frenna, although h" may have
played the i.-irt of â  dupe, was in reality
I a shylock ever eager and persistent in
, demanding his full pound of flesh. it
: would not hive a very favorable impres-

that â¢very time he loaned $2000 or $3000 to
Turner for ;i few days he not oni
acted interest at Urn rate Of from 2Vi to
Z> per cent a month, but actually extorted
a bonus cf from $20 to $;iÂ«'. hM In ad
vance, it is the business "f Frenns
torneys to prevent any such information
getting before the jury ami the;.
working with that end in view all the
time.
Dozens of promissory notes, call'ng for
various sums from $100 to $Mot, payable
from one to ten days after date, were
handed to Frenna during the course of
the cross eisinlns lion for Identification.
HÂ»- refused to be certain whether he had
<-ver seen them before >>r whether be had
any financial dealings with Turm-r on the
date on which they purported to be â¢ \- -
cuted. Neither could he recoiled that be
had ever received a bonus of $1"" for the
use of a loan of a few thousand dollars
for ten days, or whether he had on nu
merous occasions extorted bonuses of 190,
W0 and even $*â¢ from Turner for !(.â 
of small amottnts of money, ranging from
?:"â¢' to $lsw fur one day. He also pro
fessed to be unable to remember any
thing concerning a loan for $3000 made
by him to Turner on September s, 1S!Â»2, for
twenty days, for which he whs alleged to
have received a bonus of $3'Â»). Later he
was forced to admit, apparently much
against hi.s will, thai be had made a loan
of mOO on the date mentioned, but he per
sisted in bis declaration that be rein.-m
bercd nothing about having received any
bonus. And yet be would nol go so far
as to swear he had not r- -..â â [ the
bonus.
The monotony of the proceedings wan
broken during the afternoon when, hav
ing passed the stage of Shylock loans, the
rross-examlnatlon of the witness turned
on the matter of the worthl<
and mortgages with which Turner had ;
showered Frenna In order to keep him
quiet. The prisoner's memory underwent
a sudden awakening at this stage and
the recollection of the manner in which
he had been gulled and robbed railicwi
him to let loose a torrent of explanations,
which the attorneys, assisted by the
court, found It almost impossible at
times to stem.
In telling the story of how Turner load
ed him down with deeds to mystical
ranches. Frenna worked himself up to a
high pitch of excitement.
"Turner kept coming to me after I found
out that he had robbed me. saying: 'Here.
Frenna. is some more property; take it
and keep it until I can settle with you."
â¢ >ne day he came to me and said: 'Here,
Frenna. is NO acres of land in Fresno
<"oumy. You take it and keep quiet. I
want to show you that I am going to
straighten up with you. Now, don't say
anything about this to anybody for if
it becomes known that I have given you
this the other fellows will get afit-r mÂ»
and I want to protect you and see that
you get your money.' "
"Well, what was the result?" uskM
Attorney Soloman.
"Why, the deed was no good. I found
nut that he never owned the land at all.
He gave me a lot of other deeds of the
tame kind. They were not worth the pa
per they wer<- written on. " replied the
defendant bitterly.
Then the subject Âf the $24.<v>0 mortgage
was taken up imii almost Immediately
the defendant, the lawyers and the court
became involved in a maz.- of argument
over 'he propriety of a question address
ed by Assistant District Attorney Salo
mon tO the witness and it was settled
only upon the indignant threat of Judge
I'nok to fine both Attorneys Salomon and
Hnfmi-r for contempt. The $24,000 mort
gage had been given him by Turner as
security for the tatter's entire indebted
ness and proved tn be worthless. An at- I
tempt Is being made to phow thai Frenna, !
knowing this fact, attempted to foist it
upon Innocent parties.
In the early hours of the morning ses
sion before the rross MlSllllllsMiili. Fren
na testified that Turner was in the habit
of carrying a revolver and he once saw
! him exhibit a bowie knife. The trial
' will go on to-day at 10 Ht a. m.
ELECTRIC CAR CRASHES
INTO A HEAVY TRUCK
Simon P. Ross Probably Fatally In
jured in an Accident Caused
by Carelessness.
As a result of a collision last ni"ht be
tween car 27 of tho San Francisco and San
Mateo Electric Road and a truck operated
by the Overland Freight and Transfer
Company and driven by William Ovens
of 180 Henry street. Simon P. Ross of 315
Twelfth street is lying at the Receiving
Hospital in a precarious condition. The
accident occurred at the base of the hill
on Harrison and Third streets, shortly
after 5 o'clock. That more people were
not Injured by the collision is due to the
coolness of Motorman Oscar Gordon.
The blame for the accident is charged
to the driver of the truck. It being claimed
that he disregarded the signals of the
approaching car and attempted to drive
In front of it. When the motorman saw
the danger of a collision he applied the
brakes and opened the sand box, but the
tracks were slippery and the ear and
truck came together with a crash. Ross,
the only passenger who was seriously in
jured, was seated on the outside of tho
car and was caught In the wreck. His
right leg whs crushed below the knee so
severely that it had to be amputated â 
There i? doubt of his recovery. The mo
torman was arrested, but was subse
quently released on his own recognisance
by Judge Conlan.
MRS. PHELAN STRONGER,
Material Improvement in Her Condi-
tion Noted Yesterday.
The physicians who are attending Mrs.
James Phelan, mother of the Mayor, late
last night issued a bulletin announcing a
marked Improvement in their patient's
condition and they now hope that she
will be able, to keep up until the arrival
of her children who are hurrylnÃ here
from Europe. By closest calculation they
should arrive in this city a week from to
day. Mrs. Phelan rested much more
comfortably ail day yesterday and iras
able to take substantial nourishment.
Although her physicians are more cheer
ful over her improved condition they
still hold out no hope of her ultimate re
covery and are only tiKhtlnir to maintain
her strength until the family Is reunited
at her bedside.

THE PHILIPPINE PUZZLE.
IT will be remembered that recently we suggested
a my-UTv in the Philippine situation. Optimist*
were inMSting that the campaign was all over but
the (boating, still no one accounted for the where
v 6000 Spanish prisoners of war and a
Dumber ol Americans in the hands of the Filipino
bere. It is very difficult to con
ceive bo* rs can be held by scattered

â¢ : For a surrender, and even A '.
mini Dewey, who ratified the Singapore agreement,
laying that he probably OUgfat to be shot when
we got oar h bins. Still no considerable
number of Spanish or American prisoners issued
â ' that terra incognita beyond our lines in which
the civil and military organization of the Filipinos
sed to have been dissolved.
c tlu-n comes the information that after the
gallant campaign ever undertaken
by Ameri rs, presenting more obstacles than
the pursuit of I'illy Rowlegs in the everglades of
da, we are in ; 1 of less than one-third
of Luzon and our garrisons arc being attacked with
sanguinary results.
The slay. the natives in the rainy campaign
iei c reported to be enormous, yet the natives persist
and their fighting force seems to rise out of the
id, as if the ghosts of their dead sprang from
their unhallowed sepulchcrs to fight again.
The optimistic view of the President does not seem
to be justified in this later report. Civilians in Manila
and certain navy officers of credibility have never
adopted the view taken by the Philippine Commis
sion that the vast majority of the natives are not in
with Agninaldo. We do not doubt that
the wily natives express to our authorities their
opposition to the native leader, but their statement
conceals rather than expresses their sentiments.
The indication i> that, except the few "leading peo

famine may force them to intermit fighting to recruit
their food supply, luit there i-< in sight no prospect
of their acceptance of a statute of oblivion that will
rover the events since Wildman wrote the proclama
their own government and fanned to
flame the spark of independence.
It is ..ur opinion that the sooner our Government
recognizes that the fight in the Philippines is prac
tically with the whole people, and that we have no
friends tin re among the natives except the few who
y their countrymen as traitors, the
r it will be. The Malay character is peculiar.

THE IRON PIPE COMBINE.
m in our Kastcrn exchange*
' l â¢''! ; ' ' the pipe manufacturers' combi-
Ilat: I which the Supreme Court
: iy, was a veritable combination in
â¢ i trade and had something like a lead pipe
Ctnch on the market. It fixed prices to suit itself and
ben it chose, having no fear whatever
â¢^petition.
In the report given of the decision of the court it
tract of the combination pro
â¢ auctioning off the right to make bid
with pipe cities not in allotted territory, the
tl bidder to meet no opposition from other
| members of the trust; or U other bids were made none
â  em ihould be lower than that of the cor

â  in which bid* were asked tor in terri
â¢ â  allotted to members of the territory the agree
â¢ was that no bids should be made except under
â .pervision of the company in charge of that ter
under the agreement
A- to the manner in which the agreement was car
ried out we lenrn froi that 1 ttimony
taken in the case showing that in i&/> the indi
vidual mi- the combine were willing to fur

$13, $14 S] and $14 50 per ton, but that the price ex
: from the city of Atlanta, for example, was
i he contract was taken at this rate by the
Pipe and Foundry Company, and out of
the I bonus of ?; 10 per ton was distributed
to the other five members of the combine.
c of the rno^t interesting features of the tes
timony was the proof that t!,.- combination had a
I making large chit*, such :is Atlanta, New
St Louis and Omaha, pay higher rates than
small which bought less quantities and whose

ination against hrye towns and large orders was
â  on the principle o: "charging what the tratn<:
WOUM bear." Presumably the large towns can pay
more per ton for water-pipe than small towns, therc
they should be charged more. In other words,
there market price for iron pipe. Each con
sumer had tiis pile sized, and was then compelled to
stand and deliver.
It it gratifying that the Supreme Court found in
the law I means of declaring surh a combination il
legal and tlru? potting a stop to its practices. Califnr

Governor Gape is boasting that he has been in
communication with the national leaders of the Re
publican party. A careful summary of the 800 bills
introduced in Congress does not show that there is
in contemplation the establishment of a new national
museum.
OAKLAND, with commendable intelligence
and refined regard for all that makes for com
munity enlightenment, long ago established
a public library. This institution, under the manage
ment of Miss Ina D. Coolbrith, one of the finest of
our literary characters, reached a high distinction,
which has been well sustained. It has been housed.
however, in an insufficient, crowded, overloaded and
unpicturcsque frame building near the City Hall, and
for a long time the people have dreamed and hoped
for an improvement in its quarters. Quite happily
and unexpectedly the opportunity for such a change
came in the donation of a large sum by Mr. Andrew
Carnegie for a building, conditioned on the people
providing a site.
Mr. Carnegie has shown lavish liberality in the
creation of library facilities in this country and in
his native Scotland. Some ungracious references
have been made to Mr. Carnegie's motive in these
donations, but it need not be sought further than his
own simple statement that when he was a poor boy,
forlorn and struggling with an ambition beyond the es
tate to which he was born, his most serious handicap
was a lack of books in which to study along the lines
to which his inceptive talents prompted him. He
then promised himself that if his dreams became
realities and he ever enjoyed the possession of a for
tune he would, as far as possible, use it in putting
books within reach of all who, like himself, needed
their aid in the training that would better equip them
for a useful place in this busy world.
That promise has been kept, and to-day tens of
thousands of youth are getting the benefit of his early
experience by having access to books in the libra
ries he has helped.
The people of Oakland began and carried on to
an extent successfully the raising of the money to buy
a site for the building. But the work was undertaken
nsincM men, who of necessity were too absorbed
in their daily affairs to give it the constant attention
needed to the end, and it was finally assumed by the
â¢ 1 women of the Kbell Society. They imme
diately organized the work and have prosecuted it
with zeal and intelligence. They proceeded in n
business way by first taking an option on a site that is
indorsed by the library trustees, is centrilly located,
very accessible from the High School, the Central
Grammar and the other schools of the .ity, for the
greatest usefulness of the library is to Ue pupils in
these schools. The City Council gave the ladies of
the Ebell a fixed time in which to complete their
work, and in the ten days which remain of that time
they should be furnished the five or six thousand dol
l:.rs' balance which is yet to be made r.;>. Oakland
should not think <>f letting them fail. The benefits to
the city of success will be manifold. Not only will
this fine building l>e assured and all of the blessings
and progress follow which flow from the use of a
well-housed public library, but that community will
certify its co-operation with other public benefactors
who, having wealth, desire to appropriate part of it
to these purposes which make for the health, happi
neÂ« and progress of mankind.
The people of Oakland will readily see that if this
effort should fail, which it will not, that city will be
disregarded when those who are able arc seeking for
a community through which they may return part of
their fortune to the public uses of the people in the
midst of whom it has been acquired.
Oakland is in. iking forward tr a fine park system,
of which she stands in great nee 1. and fnr which her
natural charms offer unexampled facilities. When
that syMem is developed there is no doubt that
the public will enjoy such addiions as have been
made to Golden date Park by the Lick statuary, the
Sharon children's playground, Stow Lake, the
Sprerkels musk-stand and the Crocker conservatory.
But there is doubt whether such liberality will be
forthcoming if Oakland should fail in this effort to
provide a site for a library building which has been
donated on that condition. .
Aside from other motives the very gallantry of the
city should refuse to let these ladies fail in their vol
nnteer work. ( Oakland raises large sums by popular
subscriptions f<>r Fourth of July celebrations, for the
entertainment of visiting bodies, and recently for the
reception of returned soldiers. Rut let us assure the
people of that city that all of these purposes, while
extremely praiseworthy, are fleeting and imperma
nent in their effect upon the community compared
with what will folio* the announcement that the gond
women of the Khell. by grace of the liberal and pro
gressive, have raised the money and bought the site
for what may be easily foreseen as the finest public
library building in California. The Call is glad to
do what it may t<> muse the liberal spirit of that city
and to encourage the Hbell ladies to persist to victory.
General Methuen's assertion that the battle of Mod
eler Kivcr was one of the bloodiest of the century
was doubtless written in the excitement of the
moment and when he has time to count up the loss
he will take a second thought and withdraw the
statement. This has been a century of wars and the
battle which exceed* all others in carnage will have
to be very bloody indeed.
Representatives of the local telephone monopoly
have told the Supervisor* that the company is ready
to pay back to the public money which has been
wrongfully collected. The greedy corporation is
either striving to pose as a mammoth joker or has
some thought of seriously crippling its capital.
The desperate zeal with which certain members of
the School Board arc striving to elect new teachers
to the department might suggest a revival of the in

WORKING UP A COAST TRADE.
ST. LOUIS GETS
UNEXPECTED AID
IN CALIFORNIA
Country Papers Start
Rear Fire.
ATTACK JOBBERS OF COAST
The members of the Pacific Coast Job
bers* and Manufacturers' Association
have had their attention called to the
fact that certain newspapers published
at Interior points In this State have been
advising their readers that their Inter
ests were rather with the St. Louis and
other Middle West Jobbers than with the
association In the coming hearing In this
city before the Interstate Commerce Com
mission. There Is no disguising the lact
that this feature of the case Is displeas
ing to the association. Traffic Manager
Loveland said yesterday:
"Since my return from the hearing be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion at St. Louis, my attention has been
railed to the attitude taken by some of
the papers In the Interior towns of the
State, which, while unquestionably hon
est, shows a misunderstanding of the case
which we should. It seems to me. at least
try to correct. The position is taken that
the Jobbers of the Middle West are Justi
fied In this attempt to secure business on
the coast, and that the retailers and con
sumers would be benefited should they be
successful in their contention. Let us dis
cuss the matter from the standpoint of
the retailer and consumer
"Under the present tariff the Jobbers
of the Middle West and of this coast are
serving the trade of this section. Neither
Is barred, and the plaintiff 1 own wit
nesses, the Jobbers of St. Louis and other
similarly situated cities, testified at the
recent bearing that they had done busi
ness on the coast right along since the
adoption of this tariff, and that their
trade is increasing. This is as it should
be. as the retailers and consumers of the
coast have the advantage of healthy com
petition. This condition of affairs Is sat
isfactory to the Jobbers of the coast
"1 coast Jobbers claim no pre-emp
tion of this territory or exclusive right
to the business therein, but have simply
Invested their capital In the jobbing busi
ness, expecting to meet the competition
of one another and of any locality so
situated as to be able to offer goods In
; this market. We claim that It is to the
1 advantage of the retailers and consum
ers to have the large shippers given a
carload rule, thereby enabling them to
carry stocks at the different Jobbing cen
ters, greatly to the convenience of the
retailers, giving them a base of supplies
near home, whore they can get such arti
cles as they would not under any cir
cumstances buy in carloads, and at a
price based upon carload freight Instead
of less than carload.
"Would it be to the advantage of the
retailers and consumers to have the term
inal between carload and less than car
load done away with? The interior pa
pers say that if this were true they could
ship 100-pound lots as cheaply as the Job
ber can ship a carload; and that the mar
ket In which they can buy would mate
rially widen. Granting that this is true,
th. v could not buy their goods for any
less than they do now. while buying of
local Jobbers, for the reason that their
purchases in the East would not entitle
them to as low a price as trie Jobber gets
because he buys in larger quantities.
They also overlook the fact that If they
could ship as cheaply as the Jobber, the
large department stores of the East could
also ship at that rate and would imme
diately begjn to supply the consumers to
the detriment of the retailer. We claim
that the best possible condition Is the one
now existing, which enables the Jobbers
of different sections to compete for the
business of the coast."

TAINTED BACON CONDEMNED.
Market Inspector Witzemann Finds
Some Bought From the Gov
ernment.
Chief Market Inspector Nicholas Witze
mann yesterday afternoon condemned
twelve cases of bacon, weighing 1200
pounds. In the New York Auction House,
at 120 Battery street. Witzemann care
fully inspected the bacon and found that
it was in an advanced state of decay. He
thereupon saturated the stuff with coal
oil and ordered It sent to the fertilizing
works. The bacon was to have been sola
at auction.
The proprietor of the establishment
stated that the bacon was purchased from
one of the Government transports and
warned him' not to condemn It. ' Tho
auctioneer finally acknowledged that it
had been sent to him by Irvine Brothers,
the local grocers, to be sold on commis
sion.
Inquiry at the store of the firm at Sec
ond ana Howard streets 1 the
fact that the bacon had been received In
exchange for other t'o"ds fr>>m the com
missary at the Presidio. It is a common
practice for the Government to gi
of goods of which it his .-â¢!) iver-supply
and p-t other goods in their stead. Mr.
Irvine Stated that the bacon whm bought
was good) bin that was some m
He showed some of the same kind of
goods which he has bad on sale in hi*
place which Inspector Witzemann pro
nounced wholesome.
"It Is vary peculiar." said TVitZ'Tnsinn.
"that some of the bacon sold hy the Gov
ernment to the grocery tirm should have
been sent to the auctioneers to be I 'Id for
6 rents a pound when the wholesale pric*
Is now about 11 cents. It looks as if the
â  1 liacon wan retained b\ the k'
and tho tainted goodl seal to be Bold
for what they would bring."
SUPERVISORS WILL
ORGANIZE TO-NIGHT
CAUCUS TO TAKE PLACE AT THE
CITY HALL.
Deane May Fight the Civil Service
Law, and Is Already Making
Up His Slate.
The Supervisors-elect have finally fixed
a definite time and place for their prelim
inary caucus, and will get together this
evening at the chambers of the board at
the City Hall. The meeting is brought
about by those members who have been
most active In the tight for the chairman
ship of the Finance Committee â Henry
Brandenstein, Charles Wesley Reed and
Richard Ilotalingâ and it is likely that
that vexatious matter will come up for
settlement to-night. Reed and Branden
stein are raid to be running neck and neck
in the lead for the Job. Bo far no oppo
sition to the appointment of John Ryan as
chief clerk of the board has cropped up,
although other appointments which th*
board will have as yet have been given no
consideration.
Just now the wise ones are speculating
upon the action to be taken by County
Clerk Deane with regard to the civil ser
vice exactions of the charter. It i- gen
erally known that Deane claims that the
civil service rule does not apply to his
otilec, and ho is even now making lip his
Plate upon that theory. He claims that
he is held responsible for not only clerks
of the Superior Court but also of the
Police Court! and that he will be required
to furnish a bond of $50,000 upon assuming
Office, and that it Is not the Intent of the
charter to prevent him from employing
those for whom he will assume so heavy
a liability. Dean.- has sought legal ad
vice upon the point and says that a num
ber of the heavy-weight lawyers of the
city have advised him to ignore the civil
service clause.
ThÂ«Â« serious Illness of Mayor Phelan'g
mother has resulted In a cessation of
speculation upon hi.-* appointments to the
numerous commissions and has resulted
in an Indefinite delay in the announcement
of the Civil Service Commission, which
was to have been made on Tuesday last.
The Mayor has eschewed all political mat
ters and remains closely at his mother's
bedside. He was in his office yesterday
afternoon for a few minutes, but trans
acted no political business.

NEEDS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for thÂ«
opinions published in this column, but pre
sents them (or whatever value they may
have as communications of general Interest.
Editor The Call: The depression m
business and the decline In property in
this city for a number of years last past
have been the result of a deficiency In re
sources. A city should not bo built: it
should arrow, as a result of the loiter out
wealth upon which its prosperity Is found
ed. In comparison with St. Louis, irhl h
now has about one million of people, tn
Francisco has a very feeble agricultural I
backing. Missouri has nearly fifty thou- !
sand square miles and nearly every acre !
will make a little farm without th- ex
pense of irrigation. I asked a Congress
man from Missouri a while <i<o. who trav
eled all over the State, what he thou
of California. .
"Well, doctor, I like your country pretty
well what there Is of It. but there's tco
much of it covered up by these hero great
biir high mountains.
Water! water! water! Is the need of
California to Increase itÂ» agricultural ca
pacity and necessary to render this a man
ufacturing city. With water brought from
the mountains San Francisco can be DM IS
the cheapest and the grandest manufac
turing city on the globe. Water, by cor
relation of forces, can be changed into
electricity and through this force th. city
can be lighted, the street cars moved
every demand for power supplied. lVr
manent employment can be given to la
bor and the city by the hundred thousand
will grow rapidly in population. Water
will not rise above Its level and a city
cannot grow but in correspondence with
its resources. it will become dull. .if.
lens and profitless in proportion as It is
built beyond the elements of its nutrition.
This city now is like a rickety childâ the
head Is too big for the body. Wo have too
many stores "to let" and too many houses
without tenants. We must stand still or
provide more business tributaries. With
adjustments repairs and elongations and
plenty of water to flush the sewers will
keep for a long period without generating
any cause of disease. Under all the cir
cumstances It will be well enough to vote
for school and hospital bond*. We have
no more use for the panhandle and Its al
lied concatenations than we have for a
quarter Lection in the Great Sahara 1-c-s
ert. There Is no analogy between San
Francisco and Paris. Monkeys and fools
are imitating animals. Men of sense an
alyze their environment and conduct tli.-ir
lives accordingly. San Francisco is Â»iO
balcony climate. Many persons avoid
residence here in consequence of the fogs
and. as for "breathing places." the super
abundance of "breath" drives many awoy
and prevents others from coming.
People tolerate trees here to "break the
wind", and cut them down where they do
not serve this purpose. San Francisco r .is
a climate radically different from any oth
er spot on the earth. It Is unique, even
in its own State. We are seal-Jacket Â«nd
overcoat packers the year round. Houses
make a - it v and not parks. Let the four
hundred houses remain on the panhandle
and add others to them to shelter us from
the wind. We have a mile of desolate
panhandle already. It would be a good
speculation to sell It and put the money
into mountain water works. Only about
one-third r.f Golden Gate Park is Im
proved. Properly reclaimed we have parKs
enough for millions of people Taxes will
increase and property depreciate lust in
proportion as we Incur bonds for super
fluities and neglect "public unities " this
talk about 'â¢building a dty" Is nonsense.
A city that Is of any account forges ahead
from the Irresistible power that Is at if.c
I*< X t)I it.
The bllÂ«fit of decay soon attacks a root
less tree. ,-. D. CLEVELAND.

matter is so simple that it seems almost
impossible that there should be any
ground for argument on that point. It
takes 100 yearsâ not S3â to complete a cen

completed the first century, and the sec

to complete nineteen centuries, and for
that reason 1901 will be the first year of
the twentieth century.
HEMP DEALERS
OF THE COAST
MEET SURPRISES
Eastern Houses Deny
the Shortage.
OPEN VERSUS CLOSED PORTS
News has been received in â  private dis
patch that two large. Eastern manufac
turing concernsâ the McCormack Harvest
ing Company and the Plymouth Cordage
Company of Bostonâ have asked the War
Department to keep the ports of the Phil
ippines closed. The basis of their argu
ment Is â  denial that there is any scarcity
of hemp In tho United States; also that
â  per cent of the binder twine used In the
United States is made from sisal imported
from Mexico. They also deny that therÂ«
is any dearth of hemp twine In the coun
try.
These statements are so opposed to all
the facts as they are understood hero
that the largest hemp Importing concern
on the Pacific Coast, the Tubba Cordago
Company, was applied to for Information.
Astonishment was manifested at once by
Manager Kellogg when ho heard of the
representations of tho Eastern concerns.
â¢"In two or three months." said Mr. Kel
logg, "there will be a famine of hemp If
the ports are kept closed. Naturaily wo
wish the ports to be open. v - â  have sup
posed that the houses named In the dis
patch that you have shown uh were in
favor of open ports. There la no par
ticular scarcity of the raw matt-rial now.
but there will bo a great shortage in tho
near future unless the conditions in the
Philippines are changed. The price has
been largely advanced simply because tho
ports are closed. In I&M spot hemp
brought 6U cents. Upon the correspond
ing date this year, November 3). the price
was HVi cents, or double the price 01 last
year. There la no hemp In Manila and
none can be brought out until the ports
are opened. 1 suppose there is hemp in
the provinces, but the situation now U
like an embargo.
'It Is not true as applied to this coast
that fes per cent of the binder twine Is
made of sisal. I would think that it would
be. nearer the truth to say that ho per cent
of that twine 1m made of hemp on tho
Pacific Coast. Hemp goes further to thÂ«
pound In making twine and I- better than
the s-ls:Â»l. Sl.-iil has also advanced. In
islrt. on November Jj. sisal whs worth 6 to
â¢'â¢' 4 cents. On the corresponding date this
year It was quoted from h 3 * to S& cental.
Sisal cannot be used for chips.
"A great quantity of hemp ropo ha*
been used here in connection with the oil
well Industry. A leading oil man comp
lained to me that the price of hemp rope
and the price of pipe combined were eat
ing up all the profits of the oil industry.
Last year hemp rope sold at 9 cents per
pound, and It now brings Is cents. ThÂ»Â»
stocks of imported hemp on hand in New
York and Boston f>n November 3> last
were as. follows: New York, 101 Nile*;
Boston. Â©JO bales. On November 30. K>B.
th>' stocks were: New York, 10.000 bales;
Boston. 4000 bales. In U'j' the stocks wero
on November 2Â»: New York, 13,'f10 bales;
Boston. II.UjO bales. FitW of Philadelphia
in buying up all the hemp that he can got.
Our advices are that the hemp on the way
from Manila amounts to Â»;j,'<m bales and
that is all sold to arrive. We are thrÂ»
largest hemp Importers on the Pacltlc
Coast. There Is only one other on the
coastâ the Portland Cordage Company.

The cruiser Philadelphia came down

Wilsons, Colored and

Perjury, bald-fac*d and plenty of It,

Harry Wilson, the colored man whose
relâ te resulted in the present outrage on
the respectable element of the city, was
tne â eoaaUonal iTltntue yesterday. He
was recalled frequently throughout the
day ami finally his IndicnaUoa g"t the
best of him. Referring to lha â tatementa
of Altorney J. N. Â£. Wilson published
yesterday, be said: "This man Wilson
iiah attempted i*>ng enough t<> make these
gentlemen of the jury belleye that 1 am
a strunglt-r and a inunU rer: he has trieÂ«l
to make them btlieve that 1 went over a
circuitous routu to California and Mont
gomery streets, ami then, during his ab
sence, ran away. This is absolutely
faJse. I went with Wilson t j ihe house
on Howard street and there 1 paid him
three $100 bills. He denies that he gol
a cent from me and that ho went down
tÂ«i the Cafe Royal and to other saloons,
he also denies thai he told me that 1
rmiid go and that the case against me
was squared, but be â¢ t i â¢ i tell me all of
these things and he also got the throe
$luu bills. He is simply swearing to dean
bis skirts of this $*"i huslnoss. but what
1 tell is the truth."
The witness was asked if It was not the
truth thai be bad t â¢ >1U W. S. Harne9 at
the County Jail that he was anxious to

white woman In this city and continue
on a course of robbery with her. This
the witness positively <!<'iÂ»iÂ«'d and he
added: "Mr. Barnes win nut testily to
this either. A Hh->rt time later Mr.
liarneh, whn will appear as a witness to
day, paid that he positively would not
swear to the statement that Wilson told
him that be wanted to get out and con

woman, who has frequently been refer

During yesterday's proceedings Henry

the. envct that be never offered himself
as a bondsman with the same properly
accredited to his ownership as Is dos. ill,

Nurse Girl Claims to
Be an Heiress.
BIG FORTUNE IS INVOLVED
FLORENCE GOODMAN SAYS HER
AUNT DESERTED HER.
From kitchen drudgery and the trying
occupation of nurse girl to an Alameda
baby with lusty lungs little Florence
Goodman, a colored orphan girl, has sud
denly become aware that ilm Is an heir
ess. She has every reason to believe that
her grandfather, the late George Good
man. who died last New Year's night in
this city, leaving a fortune of nearly $30.
wO In good hard coin, provided for her
In a handsome manner, but that a will
antedating that in which she was men
tioned bo substantially has been admitted
to probate.
Her attorney. Charles E. Naylor, has
been looking Into the matter for several
weeks ar. â¢ yesterday reported that he had
â 1 the conclusion that his ilient had
good grounds for attacking the alleged
last will. Legal proceedings will be taken
to have the order admitting it to pro
bate set aside. This will be undertaken
on the broad grounds that the testator
was of unsound mind at the time of mak
ing the alleged last will, and that he was
unduly Influenced against his grandchild
by liis son and daughter.
The life history of Florence Goodman
would make a good foundation for a
melodrama. She is the child of the late
George Qoodman's favorite sun Moses
AdolphUS <;<H,du::ui, now deceased Her
ta died when she was scarcely 10
â¢Id, and from that time on until
his death fhe was cared for by her grand
father. She was his constant companion
and Memed to bring sunshine to the old
man In his declining years. A few dnrs
after his death, according to the stor*
tOM by the little colored girl, li.r aunt
MM lincJ( â the son and daughter of the
deceased -inirri.d her away to the Girls'
Training School and left her among
strangers. They did not call upon her
or off'T her any financial .. after
they bad turned her over to the managers
of the school.
Happiness had gone out of the girl's
Hie and the tuture was not promising
whr-n city Clerk Ben P. Lamborn of Ala
m<-da Visited the institution in search of
a nurse girl for a lusty limb of the 1 im
burn family. n< nee 0 odman was rec
ommended, and she went to live at the
Lamborn home across the bay Mr Llm
bora's Inquisitive turn of mind prompted
him to Inquire Into the iiu r-. â  ante
cedent*. Hiid he soon learned from her
the m.t> of her rich grandfather who
promised over and ore* again to pro
vide for her in his will. M r . I.amborn
petitioned the Superior Court of Alameda
County for letters of guardianship over
the girl, and when they were granted he
plai â¢ "1 her case in the hands of Attorney
Naylor.
The (inodman will was admitted to pro
bate January IT. The petition accompany
ing it set forth that the estate was worth
about $7 KM. The appraisement subse

Expectorators Take iVarning.
The eleven menâ whites and Chineseâ
arrested on Wednesday for expectorating
on the sidewalk were distributed among
the four Police Courts yesterday. They
were all admonished and discharged, with
the exception of Louis Frlzer, a cook, who
was lined $.">. with the alternative of twen
ty-four hours In the County Jail, by Judge
Conlan. Frlzer was arrested by Police

he testified that he warned Frizer three
times before he arrested him not to ex

attention to the warnings.

Yin.â ALEXANDER HAMILTON.
BY WILLIS M WWn, M. A.
Boyhood â Education â The Revdlution
Information r.'Kirdlng the family of Al- \
exander Hamilton is meager and the
â tatementa ;iro eontnuUetory. Amooi
temporaries ho was eommoniy reputed of
illfKkimnte t>irth. and John Adams refets
to him In a letter to JcCeTWMI as "thJt
bustard brat of a Scotch peddler." He
was born in the West Indies and his
mother seems to have boon of Fren'h
Huguenot descent. To this parenta**- M
ographers are fond of ascribing his youth
ful precocity and the tropical pa
and Celtic impetuosity of his later years,
and surely to cotonlaJ Americans there
must have sef-med something exo^Jc .n tlie
social ease and vivacity of the dark, slrn
der, erect, eag^r youth, with glowing eyÂ«-s
and massive head. who. mere str
though he was. began at 18 to play a
stirring part upon the turbulent sta**>.' of
revolutionary politics, and who while yet
younger than an average sophomore, be
came Washington'! trusted emissary
upon political missions. In these pictur
esque traits, however, we must not lose
sight of "he cool, penetrating logic which.
after all, was Hamilton's most remark
able personal characteristic, nor of hlj in
stincts for strong government and for na
tional unity, which were to rank Mm
among the constructive statesmen of
America.
At 16, with sufficient funds and good
Introductions, young Hamilton was sent
to New York to complete his education.
With tireless application and fiery ener
gy he fitted for King's College in a year
and devoured the course afterward at a
ALEX4NDKR HAMILTON.
like rapid race, until the crisis in politics
drew him ;rito public Ufa in 1774, two yea-s
after his arrival. The war of his I
wish irai coming and he took sides with
all the fervid enthusiasm of hi* nature.
An impromptu and -tra:.Â»-el> succesjful
speech at a patriotic meeting in the rtcld
of the New York suburbs tlrst brought
him into notice, but he won more persna
i-.ent notoriety by the newspaper letters in
which he entered the lists against tne
leading loyalist talent of the colonyâ an
agency then used by the ablest men 10
guide public opinion and a form of con
troversy in which Hamilton throughout
his life had no superior. Tempting induce
ments to change sidesâ a strong tribute
to the boy's powerâ were steadfastly :e
fused, of course, while at Urn same :ime
Hamilton thawed hi* One 'H.-.'.ain of popu
lar favor by gallantly opposing mob vio
lence toward the Tories with all the
hatred of anarchy that wu .v mark his
later career.
As war clouds thickened he set himself
to study military science, and when New
York raised a company of artillery, in 177(5.
his proven litneas secured him the com
. mand. The excellent discipline of his com
pany, rare enough in the moblike Conti
nental army at that stage, soon caught
the <â¢> of Washington. Hamilton had the
perilous task of guarding the rear in the
masterly retreat from Long Island. He
i distinguished himself at White Plains,
! and after the terrible campaign closed by
Trenton and Princeton he accepted an ap
pointment upon Washington's staff while
still a year under age. Hore his chlet reg
ular work was the management of the Im
mense correspondence of the commander
in chief. Hamilton's gay, buoyant tem
per, even in the gray winter at Valley
Forge, brought him the admiring friend
ship of his associates, nnd especially of
; the foreign officers, young ami old, and
i his trenchant pen. sound sense and quick
decision wen highly valued by Washing
ton. One would be glad to recount that
' Hamilton in turn showed some generous
admiration for the grave and stately gen
eral who bore upon his shoulders the fate
of a continent, but the evidence Is lack-
Ing.
Conservatism â Conflict With An
archy â Struggle for a
Stronger Government.
In the midst of the war Hamilton had
met. wooed and won a daughter of Philip
fichuyler. Immediately after Vorktown.
the war now plainly over, declining with
graceful dignity repeated offers of finan
cial assistance from General Schuyler. he
â¢el himself to earn a livelihood for his
wife and babe, nnd four months' rapa
clous study admit him to the New
York bar, where he at once rose to the
highest eminence.
An election to the decaying Congress
of the confederation of 1752 and his few
months' futile battle there, along with
Madison, against the Inertia of the bulk
of the members and the distressing condi
tion of the times. Is memorable only be
cause this experience seems to have gone
far toward establishing the deep distrust
of democracy and the ardent desire for â 
strong central government which were to
be the controlling ideas of his subsequent
public life.
To appreciate this later work we must
bear In mind certain facts not altogether
pleasant for an American to contempt
Not m.rely was our Government marked
by political disintegration at home and
treated with deserved contempt abroad.
Our whole society wan equally disorgan
ized. The most vicious results of he Old
1 colonial system had been the fostering
among our people of a general Indolence.
a dislike for business methods and an an
tagonism to law manifested In universal
smuggling and in the refusal of Juries to
convict for such offenses. The last twenty
years had tremendously augmented these
evils. The mob methods of the ten years'
pre-revolution contest, however neces
sary, would have demoralized any people.
To refuse obedience to the courts, to re
fuse to pay Just debts, to boycott officers
of the law. to disgracefully abuse them,
to tar and feather conservative citizens
who ventured to criticise such proceed
ings, to terrorize society through Its law
less elements In tavern committees and
nocturnal visitationsâ all this had been to
no slight extent the evidence and con
comitant of patriotism. Then these re
grettable anti-social tendencies had been
Intensified â of course by the long war.
which, aside from the Inevitable dis
integrating Influence of any successful re
bellion, however Just. had ruined all In
dustry and flooded the confused country
with a worthless, currency.
Of course the reckoning had to come.
Such conditions bring out In any *ocl*ty
a vast amount of human weakness \n<\
meanness and reckless pclfl^hness. The
account appeared not merely In the nen
eral and humiliating unwillingness to (>iy
the really slight cost of our national in
dependence and in the shameful neglect
of the suffering army. In army mutiny
and In plans for a null:., dictatorship,
but also In Shay's rebellion against tho
collection of debts and In the subsequent
whisky rebellion and Fries' rebellion to
prevent slight Federal taxation. If tn
revolution was to be proven worth while
the new republic must subdue at once the
anarchic turbulence and repudiation In
which Its stormy birth had educated a
generation. This is the real meaning of
the struggle for a new constitution. The
contest lasts through the organization of
the new government In Washington's ad
ministration, and thÂ« hero of the twelve
critical years, the victorious leader of tn.<
forces of order and honesty, is Alexan lÂ«Â»r
Hamilton. Until this time, however bril
liant his services, he had been but a leu
tenant: now he stands forth for his r*al
life work, a statesman-apostle of energy
and union.
It Is true that his aristocratic and mon
archic tendencies, his distrust of th pe<>
pie. Intensified row by his conflict wtth
popular prejudices, were wholly wrong
for America, and his party which shared
them was .-â¢ on properly punished
by annihilation. Bat his it-man ' for
strong government an.) for national unity
was wholly right, and was M Indispen
sable to our America as Jefferson's dem
ocracy was to be. We could have spared
neither of these treat antagonists, each
of whom contributed fundamental princi
ples to our national life.
Hamilton's brief congressional experi
ence was followed by his courageous
struggle In New
York against the
cruel and foolish
persecution of the
old loyalistsâ ln tho
course of which a
club of opponents
which a
of opponents
in a newspaper con
troversy compli
mented him by a
proposed plan to
kill him off by
successively chal
lenging him to
duelsâ and then by
the opening of the
contest for a con
stitutional conven
tion.
The plan, so na
tural to us. was
novel enough then.
As early as 179). In
a private letter.
Hamilton had sug
gested a national
convention to form
a new constitutionâ
evÂ«-n before the ar
ticles of confedera
tion had been rati
fiedâami In 1753. at
hi* suggestion, the
New York Legisla
ture recommends!
the plan to Con
gress. When Vlr
gtnla finally secured
the germ of a con
vention at An
napolis In ITS* Ham
ilton was a delegate
from New York, one
of the five State*
represented, and he
drew the address
of this meeting to
Congress and to the
Btates. which did
result In the great
Philadelphia conven
tion the next year.
Intimately connect
ed an Hamilton's
name is with the constitution, he took
little part in tho convention. The voto
of his colleague from h!s State was
against any effective union, and he him
â¢elf, on the other hand, desired a more
aristocratic and consolidated plan than
there was any chance of getting adopted.
In his one great speech he advocated aÂ«
his own Ideal a President and Senate for
life nnd the reduction of the States to
provinces by making the Governors ap
tiolntees of the central Government and
by placing In them an absolute veto upon
all State legislation. However, unable to
get what he wanted, like a practical
statesman he took without sulking what
he could get and threw all his marvelous
energy Into the contest for ratification.
The debt to him Is for first securing from
th.- New York Legislature a most reluct
ant representation at Philadelphia at alt.
and then for his desperate victory in
the ratifying State convention.
Organization of the Government.
The critical questions before the new
Government were those of national credit
and nance. With his Instinctive insight,
Hamilton had seized upon their coming
importance even during the Revolution,
and had already studied and written much
upon them. Fitly now Washington called
him to the head of the treasury, which
he easily made the leading position
in the Government. The story of his w >rle
here would be a history of Washington's
Presidency. The striking figure so Justly
applied to himâ "He smote the rock of
national resources and abundant streams
of revenue gushed forth"â tells only a
fraction of the truth. The bewildered
Congress, with admirable promptitude,
turned to the great secretary for guidance
and received from him In swift succes
sion report after report, from - hlch came
the funding system, the revenue system,
the sinking fund, national banking, the
currency, the rtrs? statement of Internal
Improvements and for the protective sys
tem and a ma.ss of other legislation In
the succeeding years. Economlits of other
HChools will criticise some of his view*,
but no one will deny that his plans, how
ever faulty, did lift us from the abyss of
national shame and make us â  powerful
and happy people, prosperous at home and
respected abroad.
Later Life.
In 1796. after the long and bitter quarrel
with Jefferson, both Secretaries left the
Cabinet, but Hamilton remained a close
unoftlclal adviser of that body. The Im
minent prospect of war with France In
\l<i made him the real commander and
organizer of the army under the aged
Washington, and hi* plans for the con
quest of Louisiana and Florida.â an indi
cation of a faith in our national expansion
rare in that dayâ afford an interesting
point of sympathy between him and his
rival. Jefferson. The blame for the schism
of the Federalists which followed the
clearing away of the war clouds must
be shared between Hamilton and Adam*
;u.. 1 there were petty follies enough on
both sides. Hamilton redeemed hi* rare
Flip by his wise part In helping to thwart
the mad Federalist plan of seating Burr
over Jefferson In I*)!, and by casting hi*
weighty voice against the secession plots
of the desperate New England leaders In
These were his last public acts. Though
seeing no remedy for victorious Demor
rncy In disunion, he shared to the full the
gloom of his Federalist associates. He
seems to have confidently anticipated thÂ«
overthrow of the constitution by the Jef
fersonlans. but to have looked forward
hopefully to a civil war to restore It after
a brief democratic anarchy. To keep him
self available a* a military leader and
savior of society In that struggle was. ap
parently, his reason for accepting Burr'^
challenge to the duel which ended his life
at 43 years of age.

CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â The wheat market opened
with a show of strength derived from the light
ness of Northwest receipts. May 'ii'g 1 *. better
than yesterday's close at Wli<2OÂ»JiC. Shorts
wen Â»-arly buyers and commission houses exe
cuted a plenitude of country order*, mainly
from the Northwest. Lack of a better export
Inquiry floated around, a decrease In the visible
won predicted for â¢hi!- week and Argentina re
ported rains In the midst of harvest operations,
all of which acted as an Incentive to buy. On
the advance which carried May to 704 c, nearly
one cent over yesterday, trading was active,
but lost Its animation toward the close, when
the market eased off on profit-taking and sell
ing against calls, above which mark the price
flouted most of the time. May easÂ«-d off to
U<V. at which it closed. M9%c better than
yesterday.
Corn ruled firm, strengthened primarily by
light, receipts, but t.i a degree by wheat the
fluctuations of which market It followed In a
small way. May closed hie better at tt*4
Oats were quiet and a little steadier with
other grains. May closed He higher at 244 c
Provisions were steady and the market dull
most of the time. Large receipts of hogs over
expectations and lower prices lor the same,
coupled with some selling by packers, were the
causes for the falling off in the price, but the
market hold steady at the decline In sympathy
â with grain. May pork clnaad 11-.I 1 -.- under yester

Martin Carter Sues the Supervisors and
Cotton Bros. Asserting That Bridge

by Chairman Talcott of the
Alameda County Supervisors
â which were not In the origi
nal application.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. Â»
!** Broadway. Dec. 7.
CHAIRMAN TALCOTT of thÂ© Ala- ,
meda County Board of Supervisors
\^ discovered an Interlineation In the
ordinance granting the Llvermore
Water and .Power Company an electric
franchise from Llvermore to Pleasanton,
which would have had the effect of giv
ing that company a franchise over every
road in the county. The franchit>e had
not vet bt-^n Mgned by htm as chairman
of the Board of Supervisors and he re
fused to nlÂ»jn the document until the
l>ror>Â«r corrections had been made.
Chaliman Talcott at first thought that I
the Interlineations had been roa.li' after
iht* ordiname was read before the board
â nd adopted, but an Investigation showed
that the woids were in the ordinance
when presented before the board, but
were not in the application f < r a fran
chise which w:is made some weeks ago.
When the application was made for a
franchise the application asked simply for
the privilege of erecting poles and wlr^s
from I.lvrmore to I'lÂ»-asÂ«nton along the I
main county read. This was a most rea- j
h mable request and the application was i
advertised; In accordance with the appll- |
cation. Tlun the ordinance granting the
franchise whs presented on Monday last :
by the company and it was rea.u and i
inict'tol nÂ« It was read.
Thr presumption was th.it the ordinance !
hml 1Â«. en prepared in accordance with the |
application an>l little attention whs paid
to the exact wording by any of the board. J
It was th*n adopu-d by the votes of
Chairman Tuleott. Supervisors Church. !
\Wlls ;.nd Mitchell, with Supervisor Koeth j
ii!>srr.t.
Chairman Talcott took the ordinance to- i
flaj to Fieri it us the chairman of the I
Ix-anl a!:<i in reading it over he found |
that theso words had been inserted, lm- t
Rjt-dSately following the description of the i
r.ne rÂ«^*d over which m franchise had been '
risked: "And uj">!i su.'h other roads as
the â â "!nrÂ»:iny m.iy desire."
Thin Datura! Mr. Talcotfs Â«>>â¢Â«â¢ and â¢i- at I
fir*.! th"UKlu il.at this might have Imwii |
B<ldÂ«>d after the reading of the onllnance. j
h* having no rr-ei inaction of those words i
rhen it was first presented. An Invest!- !
catlnn nhnwed that latT In the body of
lhÂ« ilorummt thÂ« same words occurred'
find not as an Interlineation. It then be- i
r.ime a Tuertlon of whether the company '
was trying to get a franchise over all of ;
th* r <nds in the county nnd the attorneys I
f<>r the company were sent for. They j
pleaded lunorance of how the words crept
Into the franchise and Chairman Talcott i
[ rdered them stricken out.
ThÂ»* franchise will probably be readopt
'â A nnd readvtrtisM next Monday, and It ',

.... to Cotton Bros,
for the construction of the new Webster
street bridge, was filed In the Superior
Court late this afternoon by Martin Car
ter, member of the firm of Carter Bros.,
<ar manufacturers at Newark. The suit
!s directed against the members of the
Alan.- County Board of Supervisors.
County Auditor J. <"al Ewlng. County
Treasurer Arthur Feldler and Cotton
Bros., contractors, as defendants.
According to the complaint prepared by
Attorney J. C. Bates, the Board of Su
pervisors awarded the Webster street
Irldge contract to Cotton Bros, on No
vember a, UM, for the sum of JW.500. and
according to plans, specifications and
blueprints tiled previously, nd sheet
No. 10. on which bids ..... whs al

pounds less of steel in the contract and
17000 difference In the cost, enumerating
at the same time that the substitution
made provides for 12 pounds of steel per
llnÂ»-al foot In place of 22 pounds. This
particular allegation Is rerlt.Mi In the com
plaint as folluwa:
"That, as a matter of fact, sheet 10, so
furnished it all bidders, has disappeared
from the files of said contract since said
contract was award* and executed and
another sheet h.is been substituted in Its
place and st^ad. like the â¢'!.*> on which
Mds were rceÂ«lv< d. with the very mat. r1;\l
exceptions that the uteri .-..- angles

weight In the substituted plans In sheet

less of steel to be used In the construc
tion of said bridee and 170*) difference In
the cost thereof.
"That the above Is only a sample of the
way changes have been made throughout
the whole plan for the size and weight
" ste. 1 as to plates, angles and channels
for the construction of sold bridge."
Th* plaintiff further alleges on Infor
mation and belief "that such fraud de
celt and trickery was practiced upon'said
Board of Supervisors for the purpose of
preventing successful bidding against
â Ud changed plans as to size, etc of
steel, and that it did so prevent success
ful bidding.
"That the board did not know of the
changes In said plans, and that said
changed and substituted plans as â¢.. said

connivance, fraud and dec-it of said de

spur has been connected with the Spear
street track of the two-county electric
line by which the San Francisco and San
Mateo cars will switch into Howard from
Spear and by this facility pain a final
terminus on the big checkered turntable
right In front of the ferry building
This, however, will not take place until
the lower portion of Howard street under
goes its reconstruction, which will be
but a few weeks at the utmost.
Ab ion as this change takÂ»-s place that
portion of Spear street between Howard

the work of reconstructing this branch
of the Howard street line will bo com
menced and prosecuted to a tiiilsh. After
the entire work has been completed the

MYSTERY FROM
THE FAR FROZEN
KLONDIKE LAND
Said She Was Robbed
of $20,000.
San Fmn<~!s-co rail.
Broadway, !>â¢ â¢ I
A mystery from the Klondike blew Into
Oakland last night, told how she had lost
$20.0fÂ»0 In this city, tried twice to commit
suicide and finally told a romance that
has hardly been equaled from that region
of romance in th" frozen north.
The mystery of a womanâ a woman with
many different nimes that might bo made
to lit any occasion, and the name for this
occasion was Murray. She was a band
pome woman of about 25, with elegant
clothing and rlnps and all the evidence of
wealth. She made her appearance at the
City Prison late In the evening and told a
stranpe story, only part of Which has been
confirmed.
The woman came to Oakland late yes
terday afternoon With a maid. She
claimed to have had with her a coat, the
lining of which w.ns filled with secret
pockets, in which she bad bidden $20,000 In
bank bill*, and during the afternoon the
muld bad secured possession of the coat
and disappeared with it and the bills. She
added that she had been on th<> Klondike
Bl -I that she had mining claims outside Of
Dawson City that were of great, value
and that she was worth at least 1100,000.
she had come fr.im Dawson for the win
ter, but Intended to return 10 that Xl Do
rado In the spring ami mnkn a million.
The story was so weird that the police
wÂ»re skeptical, and Chief of Police Hodr
klns e.xpr^ss.><l hi* doubt of Its truth. The
woman had been drinking a little and was
hysterical, and then she made two at
tempts to take her life right In the prison.
t>he drew a long hatpin from Tit hat and
plunged it Into her breast But the pin
did not reach the fle^h more than a slight
stick, nnd she was disarmed by the Chief.
Then she tried to bite an artery In her
wrist and succeeded in biting a piece of
flesh out of her arm, but not severing an
artery.
, She was finally subdued and Chief
Hodpklns detailed a special man to look
for her irilsslng coat. The garment was
finally located In â  saloon on the corner
of Seventh and AVnshlr.gton streets and
all tht- little sÂ»-rret porkets were in It
just as she had Mild, but the money. if
any th- re had beÂ«n, was gore. TV,->
woman protested that the money ha.l
been taken, but the police think that
th*Â»re was never any there.

A LIVELY MEETING.
Marshal Tou-e and Contractor An
derson Have a Wordy War.
The proceedings of the Supervisors' Fire
Committee were enlivened yesterday
morning by a wordy war between Fire
Marshal Towe and Isaac Anderson, a
building contractor. The argument be
came very heated and threatened for a
while to result In blows, but Chairman
Ileyer rapped for order, the belligerents
became pacified and the Incident came to
an end.
T-he trouble was precipitated during the
considers tlon of the protest against the
final adoption of the order requiring the
placing of brick or terra cotta Rues where
gas grates are used. A delegation of
building contractors was present and
Contractor Anderson stated that the or
der. If passed, would entail an expense of
J2T.0.000 annually on the builders. - The
present lire law, he said, was sufficient
for the purposes.
Fire Marshal Towe retorted that An
derson did not comply with the present
liiw. and also accused him of evading
the re ordinance wherever he found it
convenient.
"In that case." said Anderson, "you are
not fulfilling your duties or else yon are
tÂ« lllng a deliberate lie." Addressing the
committee. Anderson said:
"It Is an outrage that I should be at
tacked by an Incompetent official like Fire
Marshal Tow.-. If the committee will In
quire into the matter it will llnd that thin
ordinance Is advanced In the interests of
a certain corporation."
Town looked threateningly at Anderson
but declined to answer him. and the com
mit;..- postponed action until next Tues
day to await the opinion of Mayor Phe
lan.
The committee decided to recommend
the passage of the order providing that
ail electrical construction, material and
appliances used In connection with .â¢!.â <â 
trical apparatus in buildings shall con
form to the regulations r,f the National
Electrical Code. The work must be done

TWO WOMEN SEEK DEATH
JUMPED THREE
STORIES DOWN
TO HER DEATH
Frightful Suicide of
Mrs. Fiel.
OAKLAND. Dec. 7.â Three stories down
to her death Mrs. Gertrude : 'â¢.â¢â 'â  plunged
to-night. She threw herself :rbm a win
dow in the third story of the lodqjnr
hmise at 517 Eleventh street at i ft .W
o'clock and died In a few moments with
out recovering consciousness.
The cause of her horrible futeldeÂ«:ji a
mystery. Her husband, who was sleeping
by her sld*Â». claims to know nothing : korÂ«*
about his wife's death than that h? was
awakened by the nols t > of people shout'ng
In the street low. He heard -ome one
say "It's a woman." and lookln? out of
the window be saw his wife, a mangled
mass, on the sidewalk below. Ull I>IW
It came o pass he pleads Ignorance.
The only witnesses that can be found to
the affair an K. C. Lyon. the furniture
dealer, and A. .'. Daratoau. both of whom
wen in the neighborhood. They taw the
woman apparently throw herself from the
window and come down through the air
head foremost and strike full upon her
head on the stone sidewalk. Iloth Mr
Lyon and Mr. Rarati rushed to the aid
of the woman, who was still breathing,
but with -i great wound in her forehead.
They placed her upon a pile of straw until
the ambulance could t>e en lied and she
was taken to the Receiving Hospital. She
died a few moments after arriving at the
hospital and the b<Â»dy was taken to the
Morgue. Isaac Fiel. the husband of the
woman, knows nothing about the cause
for the suicide.
"I rptlrÂ«-d first nn<l my wife wont to thÂ«
window an ' nalil that <>hr muÂ«t have some
air. She thr'w It opt and I toM h^r not
to cntch cold but to Â£pt In bed. Then she
retired and I went to *!â¢â¢â¢ The next
thing I knew was the crowd In the street
below shouting 'It's a woman. 1 I pot up
and went to the window, to ilnd my wife
on the sidewalk below, nearly dead."
The couple have en in the Jewelry
auction biuinen for -everal years In Oak
land. Fiol showed the poods to the male
customers and Mrs. Fie] to the female
buyers. They were with S. Lathrop's
Jewelry auction for many months, and
have later been in a Washington-street
house.
No reason is assigned for tho suicide
unless it i).- temporary insanity. Fiel
says that there Is no reason to believe
even this theory, and he declares that
there is absolutely no reason that he can
give. The woman's skull was crushed
completely In at the forehead, and it was
cracked in every direction. Tho only
v.onder was that death was not Instan
taneous.

IRE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8. 1899.
SUFFRAGISTS
IN SESSION
Address Made by Susan
B. Anthony.
â¦
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. Dec. The Na
tional Conference of Woman Suffragists
bewail here to-day with a short address by
Governor Moimtt. Mrs. May Wright Be
wall. president of the International Coun
cil of Women; Miss Susan B. Anthony
and W. P. Flshback.
To-night at the first regular meeting of
tho conference Miss Anthony spoke on
"Women us a Mortal Force in the
World." and Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton
ppoke on the subject "As the World Bee*
us." In the course of her address Miss
Anthony said:
The part In the dally work of humanity
commonly referred to as money making haa by
, common consent fallen to the lot of man. Ev
ery business and Industrial Interest la controlled
by en. The trusts, combines and organized
capitalistic enterprises ure all controlled by
men who. :.Â«â  a matter of course, control not
only their â¢ Invested capital but also, too fre
quently, their employes'. The latter. 1 might
cay. his been especially observable in political
campaigns.
On the other hand, the charities, educational
woik. the reform movements of the churches
and of society In general are by common con
(â fnt plven to women. All the material Inter
ests for the moral and Intellectual advance
ment of humanity are. In by far the greater
number of Instances, under the control of
women In this country. And woman can't
vote! That is, she cannot vote except In four
out of ail the States and Territories of the
American Union.
Man has the vote and the balance of power.
Woman, the Intellectual equal of man and his
moral superior, cannot vote even upon educa
tional quehtlons .in.l matters of taxation In
which her own raooaj Interests may be di
rectly Involved.
The great trusts and combines have their
palil ;sfT.!s In the halls of Congress ana the
State Legislatures at every recurring session,
watching that their masters' Interests are in no
way cTidanÃered. Every report for thirty years
favoring our petition has been a minority re
pcrt. When the matter of the iniquitous can
teen system In the army during the Spanish-
American war stirred the religious and God
fearing peopje of this country to remonstrance,
and the demand was made up President Me-
Ivlnler that the canteen be abolished once and
J for all, the canteen remained to disgrace the
I army, the War Department, the President him
self and the American people. If th â  earnest
effort made by the church people of the coun
try had proceeded frrm the politicians the ran-
I teen would have been wiped out In the twtnk
, ling of an eye.
The conference will close to-morrow.
FOUR JAPANESE SLAVES
BEFORE THE COURT
ACCUSED BY MR. BANNING OF
WILLFUL PERJURY.
Slave Importer Murikama Escapes
the Lash of Justice Because the
Women Were Afraid to
Tell All They Kmw.
; Tlie examination of T. Murikama, a
Japanese keeper of a disorderly house,
was had yesterday before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock. The charge
was that of Importing four Japanese wo
men Into this State for immoral purposes.
The women had stated to Assistant
United States Attorney Banning that he
had induced them to come hither from Ja
pan under a contract to work in a hotel,
i their chief work to be serving ten-cent
j beer to the guests at a dollar a bottle,
| and that when they entered upon their
I employment they were compelled to live a
life of shame. Two of the women, Sugi
and Tori, fled to the Presbyterian Mission,
on Sacramento street, and placed them
eelves under the protection of Miss Cam
eron, the matron of that Institution.
liert Bchlesinger appeared for Murika
1 ma and Mr. Banning for the Government.
ThÂ« women went on the stand and told a
story directly to the contrary of that told
by them to Mr. Banning and Secretary
Kane of the Society for the Suppression
of Vice. They swore that they were over
the tige of 21 years, that they had come
to this city from Japan for the purpose of
working in Marikama's hotel, on Pine
s*irÂ«-et, near St. Mary's alley, that it was
n reputable hotel ard that they were not
required or allowed to conduct themselves
In oth^r thaln a ladylike manner.
Mr. Harming admitted that he had been
taken by surprise, and that by reason of
perjury on the part of tho women he had
failed to make out a case for the Govern
ment. Judge Heacock thereupon dis
missed the action and discharged the
prisoner. Two of the women, named Sug!
and Tori, asked to be taken back to the
Presbyterian Mission, and were accompa
nied to that place by Secretary Kane and
a Japanese woman interpreter from the
mission.

SET FiRE TO HIS
CELL AND SUFFOCATED
WILLIAM TfeORNE ENDS HIS
LIFE AT THE HOSPITAL.
Well Known Letter Carrier Closes
a Debauch in a Dramatic
Manner.
William Thome, a letter carrier, ended
his life last night by setting fir<> to the
padded cell at the Receiving Hospital In
which he had been confined at the direc
tion of via family In the hope that he
would recover from a debauch. Through
some carelessness the inebriated man was
permitted to have matches in his posses
sion. When , discovered by Dr. Dray
Thome was found lying In a corner of the
cell with tho excelsior coverings thrown
over him and blazing briskly. Dr. Dray
gave the alarm and quickly dragged the
man from his burning cell. He was long
past aid. the fumes having smothered the
life out of him.
As the. hospital was in danger of de
struction word was sent to the Fire Pa
trol, stationed close by. and it responded
quickly. and extinguished the fire.
Thome was sent to" the hospital by Ser
geant. O'Meara, who was requested to do
bo by the mother and sister of the dead
man. who reside at 25 Folsom avenue, off
Kighth street. Ttte young man's sister
followed him to the hospital and search
ed him, as did also Steward Davis The
latter afterward stated that he was posi
tive that his search was a thorough one
and was unable to understand how he
got possession of the matches.
Tho sister returned to tho hospital
about 10 o'clock and anxiously inquired
how her brother was progressing. Dr
Dray said he would ascertain, and on
going to the back portion of the hospital
whero the inebriates are kept, he saw
smoke pouring out of the cell After
pulling Thome Into the corridor the nhv
sleian found that life was extinct
The deceased was slightly burned
about the head. His body was removed
to the Morgue.
WELBURNS TRIAL.
O. M. \\ Ht.nrn occupied tho witnÂ»rs-
Etand In the United States District Court
the whole of yesterday. He made the
samo defense as at the previous trials
namely that he had not received â¢he
money that was paid by the Government
upon the false vonchers, but that the
money had been received nnd appro
priated iv othersâ not. however, or his
own knowledge. Hr- added a new fact
that had not been mentioned at the
former trial and that wan that he had en
listed in the First Texas Volunteers and
went with the regiment to Cuba to fleht
the Spaniards. Ho returned to Texas with
his regiment and re-enlisted In the Ninth
Infantry for the Philippines and came to
San FranclÃCo, where he. was captured
â¢while on his way to Manila.
He was cross-examined in the afternoon

examination. ;
Additional testimony for the defense
will be Introduced to-day.
MILLS ESTATE
IS TIED UP
â¦ .
Rehearing of the Case
May Be Necessary.
Special Plepatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY. Dec. 7.-On the 27th
day of last September Robert SchoMcld
Chatham and Maria Elizabeth Chatham-
Gardiner, his sister, commenced their
tight, before Judge Buck, and a Jury, for
a share of the estate of Robert Mills, de
ceased. â¢-â *.â¢â¢â¢â ..*. r . ' '
The case was long and bitterly fought
or. both sides, extending up to the 17th
day of the following month, on which day
the Jury brought in its verdict finding on
all the special issues submitted to them In
favor of the plaintiffs in the action, there
bj giving to Chatham and his sister two
thirds of an estate valued at nearly three
hundred thousand dollars.
The verdict of the Jury was unanimous
that the plaintiffs were the children of
Robert Mills and were entitled to their
share in the estate to the exclusion of cer
tain sisters, nephews and nieces of de
ceased.
During the course of the trial about 100
witnesses were examined.
In the sume matter Judge Buck this
morning liled his tindings and decree, in
which be approves the verdict of the Jury
and further finds on other issues not pre
sented to the Jury.
The attorneys for all parties were in
court this morning expecting the tiling of
the findings, as the Judge intimated last
week that he would probably do so to
ri uy.
As soon as the Judgment has been for
mally entered by the clerk an appeal will
be immediately taken by the defendants
to the Supreme Court, and from present
appearances It will be a number of years
before the matter is Anally determined.
It the matter of the same estate there
are three petitions for distribution pend
ing, one by the administratrix, one by the
sisters, nephews and nieces, and one by
the Chat hams. All have been continued
from time to time until this morning, and
this morning they were continued for one
week longer.
Unless the interested parties can agree
to continue them Indennltely, until the
other proceeding to determine heirship
has been finally settled by the Supreme
Court, it is possible that Judge Buck will
pet them for hearing in the near future.
If they are set for p. time previous 1 to tl a
entry of the Judgment in the case lately
tried, it will necessitate the trying of all
the issues, once passed upon, again.
Should the judgment be entered before
the hearing, that would probably be used
In evidence and distribution made there
on.
Should an appeal be taken from the
judgment before the hearing of the peti
tions for distribution this will necessarily

Davidson, Ph. D., with a text for an In
teresting lecture before the Geographical
Society of the Pacific, of which he Is the
nrefident. at the Academy of Sciences
Hall last evening.

a thorough knowledge of Alaska and the
neighboring country. The lecturer proved
conclusively fry extracts from for
gotten treaties and maps designed by him
for the illustration of his subject that the
United Stat.-H Is entirely in the right in

RUMOR OF A NEW
RAILROAD DEAL
Vanderbilts May Absorb
Union Pacific.
..;,:,â  Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â The World says:
Another link In the chain to span the
continent by the formation of. a Yander
bllt transcontinental railroad is rumored
to be In process of completion. Grad
ually the Vanderbilts have been buying
in the lines necessary to complete their
great plan, and the absorption of the Un
ion Pacific by the Chicago and North
western, a deal which, It is said. Is now
being â¢consummated, will accomplish the
long-sought end.
Some Important conferences between
Union Pacific and Chicago and North
western officials have been held in this
city within the past week, and there la
a persistent rumor, which Wall street
considers highly probable, that the for
nu.r system will be absorbed by the lat
ter, which the Vanderbllts already con
trol.
Tills will be done under a long term
lease, it is said. Both President Hughitt
and President Hurt of the two lines are
now in tho city. They denied yesterday
that their presence here had any such
significance as was indicated by the re
port.
Since the Lake Shore consolidation the
Vanderbilts have been in possession of a
direct line to Chicago, which was extend
ed west by the acquisition of the Chi
cago and Northwestern and wanted but
th( control of the Union Pacific to com
plete the chain to the Pacific.
There was â  meeting yesterday of the
Oregon Navigation Company in Wall
street, but only routine. . business ,was
transacted, according to the statement
given out. The Vanuerbilts already con
trol a large Interest In this line.
As projected, the Vanderbilts' new
transcontinental route win be as follows:
New York to Buffalo via New York Cen
tral; Buffalo to Chicago via Lake Shore;
Chicago to Omaha via Chicago and North
western; Omaha to Nampa, Idaho, via
Union Parlrtc; Namna to Portland, Or.,
via Oregon Navigation Company.
All the roads concerned, it is said, would
profit by this new- arrangement through
greater economy in operation. It is fur
ther said that many of the present offi
cials would be dispensed with under the
consolidation.

ELMHURST WOODMEN
MAKE BIG GAINS
BLMHT7RBX, Dec. 7.-The Woodmen of
the World held a great celebration In
this town last evening- under the aus
pices of Elm Camp So. 3SL It is the lead
ing fraternity for miles around and all of
its entertainments are well attended. The
occasion of lust evening's rejoicing was
tho initiation of a large number of new
members. A friendly contest was in
augurated in Elm Camp about two
(nonius ago. when the entire membership
divided into two companies under the re
spective leadership of Clerk Armstrong
and Past Consul Commander Critchlow.
The rival companies began a campaign
for Increased membership, it being stipu
lated that the side furnishing the largest
number of new , accessions to the camp
by the Ist of January, 1900, shall be
treated to a supper by the losing com
pany.
LOI evening the first list" of new mem
bers, whose certificates had been receiv
ed from the head camp at Denver, were
Initiated. The degree team from Oak
land Camp No. M -performed the ritualis
tic ceremonies of the protection degree
in. a most Impressive manner. The team
from Oakland has the reputation of be
ing the champion of the entire Pacific
Jurisdiction and in anticipation of wit
nessing some very tin.- work, members
of the Woodmen were present from all
Points along the line of tho San Leandro
road.
After the Initiatory ceremonies had
been concluded the party was conducted
to the dining-room, where refreshments
were served. Among those who address
ed the meeting were W. L. Boldt, consul
commander of Oakland Camp; J. N.
Prank of San I-eandro; w. L.. Temple,
general organizer for California; I. I.
l'.niik. head manager; Frank Storer. J.
D. Armstrong and Charles Critchlow of
Elm Camp. During the evening A. I.
Patton, ; consul commander of Elm Camp,
was presented with a beautiful Wood
men pin, which had been offered a reward
to the member who secured the first live
applicants for membership.
OAKLAND CONTRACTORS
ARE TO BE PREFERRED
OAKLAND, Dec. 7.â A dispatch from
Washington says that Congressman Met
calf and Senator Perkins will Insist that
the best possible material bo used in the
construction of the proposed Oakland
postolllce building, and that they both
urge that Oakland men be awarded the
contracts. In commenting: on the matter
of immediate steps to be taken relative
to the building Postmaster Friend said
to-day:
"As I understand It plans for the build
ing have already been made. We have
heard somehow that these plans contem
plate an outlay of 1200.000 for the building.
leaving, as it is generally known, $50,000
out of the total quarter of a. million to be
expended for tho site. Of that appropria
tion $75,000 was available last July, which
leaves $25,000 on hand for Immediate
building purposes after paying for the
site.
â¢â¢We expect there will be at least $50,000
in the next appropriation on the i- of
next July. That would give the $125,000,
or half of the whole appropriation, in
the first two years, with a possibility of
receiving the balance in the third year.
"With 126,000 the authorities can cer
tainly at once go ahead with the work of
excavating and the making of prelimin
aries for the foundation.
. "I presume. that the. supervising archi
tect will very soon advertise for bids for
the construction of the entire building.
"Oakland has been so fortunate in the
success of Its Representatives In Congress
in the matter of expedition thus far that
there is good reason to hope for Us con
tinuance. Expedition will certainly be
ffelcODM in Oakland after waiting so
many years so patiently for th>- realiza
tion of its new postofflce bulMlng."

HEAD WILL NOT
STUD FOR THE
PLANS OF KEMP
Refuses to Vote for
More Teachers.
REPUDIATES WHOLE SCHEME
THIRTY PLACES FIGURED ON BY
THE PUSH.
School Director Ed Head has played
smash with the plans of Kemp, Gedge and
the others of the School Hoard who are
now scheming to load thedepartment with
an end-of-the-ycar lot of teachers. Ever
since their scheme was turnitl down by
President Bergerot at thÂ«Â« last meeting of
the board they have claimed they would
be able to put th. .gs through when they
next came together, and have also claimed
to hnve Head's * - ote for the Job ip thÂ«Â»ir
sleeve. It trans7 /ed yesterday, however,
that they wore reckoning without their
host. Director Head said emphatically
that be would never vote fOlf 01 any propu
sltion of the sort and hnd never intended
to. He denied also that he hnd ever been
approaches by any of the crowd with a
proposition to stand in. !*They know too
well thÂ» stand I take on th<>sÂ«* matter*."
snld Head yesterday, "and if they have
claimed my vote have done so without
my authority. I think the department bas
row all the teachers It can carry and I
certainly will support no mÂ«\istire which
would likely jeopardize the welfare of
thosÂ«Â» now In our employment."
Mr. Head's repudiation Of the scheme
Js of larger effect than was apparent
when Kemp's g;imÂ«> Urst became known.
It was thought at tl-st that two teachers
each wits all that could be forced on the
departmi-nl. but It later transpired that a
general clÂ«-nn-up had been quietly going
on since the board took office and that
thr-rÂ»* was room In the department for at
lÂ«-ast thirty regular teachÂ«-rs. During the
iTist year numerous Ions; term leaves of
â bsence were granted and th<" substitute,
list is at the present tlrm- exhausted. In
sill thirty-five substitutes have be^n taken
Â«'ff t â¢ list and plnoÂ»"tl in the place? of the
absentees. All ><f the iwelve teachers on
the unasÂ«lgned list have also bÂ«<>n s<Â»t at
work. More room was made by forcing
ten of thÂ«* older tenchors upon the re
link list, and numerous resignations
which have lately been accepted havo left
rnnm for many mojfiJ r.nnolntments. and
they will probably be made before next
June by the incoming board. The push
had got hold of the fnct and Is known to
havo figured upon anticipating the action
uf the next board by filling the places
with Its own people, but Head's refusal
to stand In kills that scheme along with

MARRIAGE HASTENED BY
THE APPROACH OF DEATH
MISS FREDA SYLVESTER and
Dr. Joseph E. Sand were mar
ried Wednesday afternoon at
the home of the groom's pa
rent*. Mr. and Mrs. Ferdinand
Sand. The wedding was hastened
on account of the sudden and
serious Illness of Mrs. Sand, and
at her request the ceremony was per
formed at her bedside. Dr. Sand and
Miss Sylvester had been engaged for
over six years. Early last week the
doctor's mother suffered I severe Stroke of paralysis. She rallied for a time,
but Monday of this week her condition became worse and little hope was en
tertained of her ultimate recovery. Appreciating the seriousness of her Ill
ness, she sent for her son and asked that his wedding to Miss Sylvester be
celebrated at once In deference to her wishes the ceremony was performed
Wednesday afternoon at her bedside Rev. Paul Branke, pastor of St. Paul's
Evangelical Lutheran Church.' officiated: The groom Is the well-known den
tist of this city, and Is said to have been selected by Governor <sage to fill
ore of the vacancies on the State Board of Dental Examiners. His bride Is
the daughter of Mr*. Ilo'iry Sylvester of 722 Eddy street and the late Henry
Sylvester. She Is a sister of Mrs. Ben P. Lambom. wife of the City Clerk of
Alameda. and Is an accomnllshfd musician. Dr. and Mrs. Band will spend a
brief n al Lot 'â¢
the appointments, however. Is likely, as
the scheme of reorganization now being
projected by Superintendent WVbntcr will
make room for them without incurring
additional â¢ Jtpenwe.
New Rector for Trinity.
Rev. Dr. EL W. i"!:inuiÂ«-t;. rit-t^r of St.
Peter's Church. Baltimore, has been calle<l
by Trinity Episcopal Church of this city.
Assurances were received prior to the
call that Dr. Clampett would accept the
rectorship vacated by Rev. 11. K. Cooke.
The rector-t-lect Is salt! to be â  man of.
much ability and force of character.
SAW SHIELDS ON
THE WHARF AND
HE WAS DRUNK
Â«
Evidence Given at the
Court-Martial.
â¢
THAT UNLUCKY NOVEMBER 22
â Â«
The trinl of Chaplain 61 [elds Imp come
to a halt to allow the defense to secure
Borne evidence from officers in the East
and in the Middle West regarding the
state of health of the accused. By the
Interrogatories submitted It is also evi
dent that there will be gathered evidence
to the effect that the accused was threat
ened with nervous collapse; and that
stimulants were presort!. .1 for htm by
army surgeons, The court has adjourned
to the call of the president. it will be
fully two weeks before any answer has
been received to the Interrogatories, and
the court will certainly not meet for that
time at IÂ«Â»ant.
The testimony Riven for the prosecu
tion yesterday all tended to show the con
dition of the accused when ho arrived
at AJcatras on November 22 last, and the
day before, when he came down to the
Clay street wharf and bad to be escorted
back to a hotel again. The evidence wan
also made to shot* that both on the Clay
street wharf, where the boat for the is
land leaves this side of thÂ» bay, and at
the wharf at the island numbers of sol
diers and civilians saw the accused In
the condition which all the wit noâ as
have described as intoxication. " â¢*
Lieutenant Cut T. Scott of the Third
Artillery, stationed at AJcatraz, was the
lust witness mini ii in the morning.
He testified to having seen the accused
landing from the steamer and to his con
dition. liih testimony was to the same
effect aB that of the others who had pre
ceded him on the standâ that was that
the man was drunk. He said, too, that
he assumed tho chaplain's condition was
caused by too much whisky. He added
that at the time the boat landed the
wharf was crowded with soldiers, and
that soldiers were looking down from the
porch of the quarters Just above the
wharf upon the people landing.
The second â â¢.-.- was Frank Watson
clerk of the steamer McDowell. He said ho
saw the accused on November 21. Shield*
came down to the boat escorted by two
friends, whose assistance, according to
the witness, he very much needed. Wat
son says the wharf was then crowded
with people, among them being several
of the members of officers' families and
soldiers waiting to po over on the boat
to the island post. Watson says be' told
the two men- with the chaplain that their
charge was in no condition to go over to
the Island, and he advised them to take
him back to his hoteL They evidently
agreed with Watson, for they took Shields
away, and he did DOt go over to the 13
land until next day.
Watson wound up his testimony by say
ing be believed Shields was drunk when
be saw him on the wharf.
This ended the testimony of the dcy
and also the morning session. The after
noon was occupied with th.- reading of
the Interrogatories to â¢ >â  sent Bast, nnd
the cross-Interrogatories to be sent with
them. One set of questions will be sent
to Dr. Charles G. Plummer at Salt Lake,
another to Dr. Fockt, late major and sur
geon of volunteers, who .8 now at Lewis
berg, Pa., and a third set to Major Pol
hemus. surgeon of the United States
army, who is supposed to be In St. Aug
ustine, Fla. Each of the three physicians
is nsked what the state of health of the
chaplain was when ho was under their
observation, and If they ever prescribed
Ftiinulants for his peculiar condition.
With the allowing of these interrogatories
the session of the court closed.

Governor Gage will rail an extra session
of thÂ» Legislature. Several months ago
The Oill predicted that he would bring
th.- members together In Sacramento for
the purpose of tilling the California va
cancy in the United States Senate. Refer
ence to the liles of The Call will show
that this journal has announced in ad
vance of official promulgation all the Im
portant appointment! made by the pres
ent Governor. No mistakes were made
in forecasting executive intention In th-Â»
attribution of patronage, and no mistake
i:- now made in predicting the â¢ >.t.i ses
noa .
This ability to foreshadow the Gover
nors purpose in public affairs should not
lead "he Call's readers to fancy that the
management of this paper and the Gov
ernor exchange innermost contldences.
1 ''â â¢â¢ success in fort-casting Game's move
ments is due mainly to The Calls superior
enterprise In collecting lews and sifting
out the grains of truth from the mass of
rumor. Indeed The Call's accuracy is a
special tonic of comment in the executive
office at Sacramento. Accurate informa
tion up to date has been obtained without
resorts to the courts for a writ.
The story published In yesterday's Call
wherein the words of the extra session
agreement were given created comment
from morning until night. a dozen
verifications of the story were received
during the day. There was one slight mis
take, however, in the published article.
The name of Merrill of San Francisco was
used Incorrectly for Merritt of Santa Bar
bara.
Assemblyman Morritt has been In Sar.
Francisco most of the time since the ad
journment of the Legislature last March.
Burns Is anxious to tain Merritt's vote,
but the Assemblyman when importuned
by the boas responded: "The people !n
my district are opposed to your election."
To this remark Burns replied: "You don't
have to live in your district all the time,
do you?" Mr. Merrltt voted for Grant at
the last session. Before the extra session
begins Mr. Merritt's friends and neighbors

kindness and sincerity not to blight his
onrc-er by following the example of
Wright, .Simpson. Jilson and Cosper.
Word comes from Tulare that Cosper
has moved out of his district. Poor old
Simpson has gone into obscurity. His
name is hardly mentioned in Pasadena.
Senator Simpson was once highly spoken
of as a man and statesman.
Henry C Dibble, Assemblyman. Forty
first District, is sure that an extra ses
â lon will be called, but does not say that
he is able to name the winner In the
Senatorial contest. He cannot tell why
Governor Gage pocketed the bill for San
Francisco harbor extension, which passed
both houses <â >( the Legislature at the last
regular session. Concerning the proposed
harbor Improvement the Assemblyman
said'
"If I were Governor of the State I would
call an extra session of the Legislature
to provide the wharfage faculties de
manded by San Francisco. I would call
it for this purpose alone if there were no
Senatorial vacancy â¢â < till. I came in
terested In the feawall extension last ses
sion because the people of my district
were anxious that the wall should be ex
tended to the original limit on the north
side of the city. The bill, as introduced,
provided simply for southern extension."
Judge Dibble grew quite eloquent in de
scribing modern ships of such length that
existing docks could not accommodate
them. when his attention was directed to
the extra session caucus agreement hn
confessed that his knowledge of that sub
ject was limited. He was confident, how
ever, that an extra session would be con
vened, and that If sixty-one Republicans
entered the caucus the remaining twenty
four could not be excluded. "In caucus*,"
continued the Assemblyman, "the major
ity rules and whatever conditions the ma
jority prescribes will govern the caucus.
One baiiot or one hundred ballots may be
taken before the lowest candidate Is
dropped. The number of ballots will de
pend upon thÂ«> Incision of the majority."

Lnnnls McClaren was determined to die

him, and he succeeded yesterday In hi**
design.
Ho stabbed himself twenty-one times
last Monday In the cellar of Mrs. Morris
Wlndmillei at 1463 Oak street, to which
he had gained an entrance unknown to
the inmates. Mrs. Wlndmlller sent for
the police and when Patrolman Bruner
arrived, McClaren was found in the back
yard bleeding and moaning with pain.
He was removed to the Cm Receiving
Hospital and thence to St. Mary's Hos
pital. Shortly before noon yesterday
while his nurse was temporarily out of the
room. McClaren tore the bandages from
his wounds and made a rope, and a slip

heavy rain may fall to-day and has re
ceived reports that tell of heavy damniro
to the cranK* crop around San Rcrnardlno
because of hlÂ«rh winds. Frosts were, ex
perienced early yesterday mornlnr In
many parts of Northern California.
Then* is now a heavy storm !i.Tflln*
around the Orepon coast, but It will prob
ably not come within four hundred miles '
of this city. All over the. coast th#Â»
weather Is threatening and .t will not b#Â»
safe to venture forth to-d.iy without
maklnr ample preparations for a down
pour. Lieutenant McAdic says that In
this vicinity the rain may be very heavy
and that It may gradually turn to -now
In the mountains. The only thlnjr that
can avert the storm I- n definite ch.ineÂ»Â»
of wind, of which at present there Is not
the least Indication.
The bureau has prophesied frosts for
the part of the State north of S.icrnmentn
