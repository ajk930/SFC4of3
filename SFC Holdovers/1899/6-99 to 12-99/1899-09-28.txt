Admiral Bevvey, on the Bridge of the Olympia,
Steams Past the Line of Men-of-War and
Receives the OfHciaf Greeting of Comrades

NEW YORK, Sept 27.â Through
frolicking whitecaps ' the Olym
pia moved majestically up the
lower bay to-day and passed
through the picturesque strait, j
; guarded by Forts Wausworth and

â¢ come of the steel-^valled men-of-war,
as their stately ship glidrd up to her
position at the head of the. column,
â¢there to remain until the great naval
pageant tart on Friday
Never, perhaps, did a triumphant
warrior returning from a victorious
campaign receive a mere impressive
welcome. Although thousands upon
thousands witnessed it from shore, bal
cony, window or housetop, and the !
man-of-war anchorage at Tompkins : j
\ille, where the fleet lay. fairly j
swarmed v;ith lu^s, yachts. and steam- 1
ers'and every serf of harbor craft, all ,
jet black with wild, cha'srlnj. exulting j
people, and the towering white walls j
of the city b:yor.d were brava with a j
irilwcn welcoming lags, to-day's greet
ing to Dewey was the greeting of his
comrades cf the navy. And it was j
eminently nttirg that his comrades in
arms chould hrxve the first chance at
him whom the millions are waiting to j
honor. The r.ccr'e will begin to get at t
him en Friday ar.d Saturday.
To outv. am appearances tne- welcome j
he received from the fleet was strictly j
professional. One ran find the salutes, j
the trumpet flourishes, the Irurnruffles, J
the parading of the marine guard and
a!! the re^st of the ceremonies done in
hr SOtfSTTra-oayj neSSrfh&CtHfi the naval '
regulation*: or due to one of his rank.
But that only in-pressed the mind the
more because even naval regulations, i
rigorous and inc-!a?tir as they are,
could not restrain the pent-up enthu- j
fiasm when it broke forth as it did !

more than it could the' bell cords of |

aboard the excursion boats. Cheering !
is not permitted by the naval regula
tions abc-ard men-of-war, but no re
proof followed to-day's breaches of dis
cipline
It was a perfect day, though drifting
rlouds, driven by a strong land breeze,
obscured the sun during the morning
and the waves of the lower bay were
capped with white foam. In the after
noon the flying clouds disappeared, the
breeze died away and the sum bathed
the sea in brilliance.
Very early in the morning, before j
Dewey left his anchorage inside Sandy
Hook, Rear Admiral Howison, com
mander of the South Atlantic squadron, !
aboard his flagship, the Chicago, which
arrived outside last night, travel
stained and weather-beaten after her
Journey 01 21.000 miles around South
Africa, foamed in past the Hook, ex
pecting to .in the North Atlantic
squadron in receiving Dewey upon his
arrival. As Howison rounded the spit,
where right under his eye lay the
Olympia, the surprise on the face of
every man on board could be discerned
without th.- aid of glasses. Bui sur
prise is not an emotion men In the navy
indulge in loner, and Dewey's flagship
was no sooner 'recognized than pre- !
parations were made to give him the
loudest and most energetic welcome
they could give. The shells were
manned, the marine guards were pa
raded and seventeen roaring guns were
loosed in honor of Dewey.
The Chicago's Jackies cheered wildly
as she steamed past. The Olympia re
f-ponded with thirteen guns, and the
two admirals, come together from two
ends of the earth, waved a welcome to
each other from the bridge of their re
spective vessels. The Chicago con
tinued on to the upper bay, and upon
arriving there was saluted by the New
York. Only the flagship of a squad
ron salutes upon the appearance of . a
r^ar-admlraJ.. The remainder of the
IV-et gave only a silent welcome to the
voyager.
Long lines of crazy quilting, the uni
versal language of the sea, fluttered
from the signal halyards of the New
York. Rear Admiral Sampson's flag
ehlp. and the Chicago, after a good
deal of wigwagging from the bridges ;
of both ships, dropped her anchor, at j
the foot of the column, close under the
lee of Staten Island.
Rear Admiral Sampson's blue flag
came down as soon as the Chicago i
found her berth. Rear Admiral Howi
son Is his senior, and to the main truck
was hauled up the two-starred red i
pennant, which denoted that he was
outranked. It was explained subse- j
quently that the Chicago did not get to
the head of the column, the place to ,
which she was entitled, because the !
place had been reserved for the Olym
pia, and to have gone there would j
have forced Dewey's flagship beyond j
the edge of the main ship channel.
Rear Admiral Sampson's gig was Im- I
mediately lowered and he went aboard ,
the Chicago to pay his official respects j
to his senior. The captains of the â¢
other ships, the Indiana. Massachu- i
setts, Brooklyn. Texas and Lancaster,
followed suit, for naval etiquette is
both prompt and exacting. -
Meantime the beautiful white- yacht
The San Francisco Call.
Dolphin, with Assistant Secretary Al
len aboard, had hurried down to the
Olympia. The Dolphin flew a white
Gag containing four stars with a
fouled anchor in the field, the flag of
the Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Al
len personally was conveying to Ad
miral Dewey the greetings and compli
ments of President .McKinley. He
went aboard in a launch and was re
ceived on the gangway by the admiral
himself.
The marine guard, at present arms,
was mustered aft, and as Mr. Allen
came over the side drum ruffles and
bugle flourishes were sounded in his!
honor. When the Assistant Secretary
of the Navy goes aboard a warship the |
regulations prescribe that his flag be
hoisted to the main top. Up went the
flag, but as soon as the greetings had
been exchanged at Mr. Allen's request
it was hauled down and Mr. Allen re
mained as the guest of Admiral Dewey.
It was the desire of the Navy Depart
ment not to detract in any way from
the honors to be accorded D^wey.
An officer from Fort Hancock shortly
after came on board to convey to the
admiral the welcome of the army, and
then, a few minutes after 9, just as the |
tide turned flood, the Olympia weighed |
anchor and began her journey up the
bay. The tugs and harbor craft which
had been hovering about since day
light tooting and shrieking their salu
tations at every opportunity, fell into
her wake and puffed proudly up be
hind her. Every vessel she passed
gave her a vaporous salute, and as the
shipping increased the noisy demon
strations became, almost continuous.
Th^ flrurr of h^ror of the^a&j WAS
in full relief against the sky as he stood
up on the bridge chatting with Assist
ant Secretary Allen and the group of
officers. He occasionally turned and!
smiled and bowed to th( noisy escort.
The Olympia was very stately as she
car.-. â¢ on; her white hull with high free
board seemed frail, but the ugly look
ing gun/ frowning from turrets showed
ivh< re lay the power thai had destroyed
Spain's sea power on the other side of
the world. A long pennant of smoke,
white as bleached linen, stood away |
beautifully toward the shore, the loose
strands at the end disappearing as they
were torn to shreds by the land breeze.
The Olympiads superstructure is all
painted white and only the yellow
stacks and red mouthed funnels gave j
a touch of color to the oncoming
cruiser. The admiral's flag stood out
jauntily at the main mast and the na- j
tional colors floated over the taffrail.
She did not seem to be disturbing the
water as she glided along. There was
little foam at her beak and no combers
at her stern. There was hardly a sus
picion of the turning of the screws
pushing 6000 tons of steel through the |
waves. The. grassy heights of both
Wadsworth and Hamilton were tinged
with spectators as she approached the
Narrows. Subsequently a tongue of
red flame leaped from the granite side
of Fort Wadsworth and like the recoil
came a stroke of fire from the granite
wall on the opposite side. Alter
nately from each side came the deaf
ening roar of an admiral's salute of
seventeen guns.
Slowly and majestically the Olympia
passed the smoke-wreathed forts, an
swering the salute gun for gun until
she became so enveloped in her own

every ship in the receiving column had /
been burnished; every spot of the white ]j
hulls painted over and every marine J
and sailor knew he was expected to
look his best. Along the railing of the ,
ships the Jackies stood elbow to elbow C

they looked with their gold epaulets
and belts and clanking swords, gather
ed in the ways of the ship as the Olym
pia approached.
From the New York barked the sig
nal gun, a six-pounder in the starboard
bow, and immediately every ship in the
squadron belched â  smoke and flarrie.
Louder and louder thundered the guns
as the Olympia came on. She replied
with the thirteen guns to- which Bear
Admiral Howison's rank entitles him.
On board the Olympia the sides were
manned and the band and the marine
guard were paraded.
As the Olympia came abreast of the
Chicago the guard presented arms, the
drums gave four ruffles, the trumpets
four flourishes and the band played,
"Home, Sweet Home," dwelling with
swelling cadence upon the minor bars.
The officers raised their gold bound
beavers and the sailors cheered.
Ship after ship took its turn in doing
honor to the admiral, as the Olympia
sailed grandly up the line of floating
fortresses and the flood of sentiment
swelled up in their hearts. Admiral
Dewey, from the bridge, acknowledged
each salute with a wave of his cap.
He alone of all the officers of the fleet
was in fatigue uniform.
As the Olympia swept by the New
York, the last ship in the column, the
full marine band aboard the Olympia
played Sousa's "El Oapitan" march,
and the spectators on the excursion
fleet cheered. The skippers turned
loose their whistles and sirens. Every
thing that could make a noise in the
harbor joined. Farther than ears could
hear the steam Jets of the whistles on
craft lying at the Battery and up the
North and East rivers could be seen as
they roared their welcome.. It was
such a soul-maddening concert of
steam whistles as American steam
boat men are famous for.
In a few moments the sharp rattle of
the anchor chain was heard as the
Olympiads anchor catted from its bed
into the water. Then came the ad
mirals and captains from all the ships
trooping in their swift wuter carriages
to pay their respects to the nation's
hero. First Rear Admirai Howison
with his aids, splendid in gold braid,
arrived. As they came aboard they
were given the honors due their rank.
Admiral Dewey was still in fatigue
uniform when he received his old class
mate at the gangway. There was a
cordial smile and a hearty handshake
with a "How are you, Howison?" that
thrilled the spectators. The official
visit to the Olympia lasted for over an

torious Campaign Receive a

hour. Meantime scores of rowboats.
tugs, launches and yachts formed about
her, many with relatives or sweethearts
or relatives of friends aboard.
Almost the first to make the gang
way was the Narkett, with Admiral
Dewey's relatives. The party was
given a warm greeting and taken to the
cabin. One officer was so overjoyed at
the sight of the wife he had not seen
for twenty-three months that he rushed
down the gangway and kissed her in
the presence of 10,000 people. Some of
thr> visitors had flowers for the ad
miral, and more had good things for
the crew. One man presented the crew
with a rowboat load of watermelons.
As soon as Admiral Dewey could de
tach hirtsrlf from those who were so
eager to see him, he returned the offi
cial visits which the etiquette of the oc
casion required. He first called upon
Rear Admiral Sampson, whose ship lay
next to his. and then /upon Rear Ad
miral Howison, at the othtr end of the
line. For this ceremony the admiral
himself donned the full uniform of his
rank. There was a pretty ceremony
as he went aboard the New York and
the Chicago, and as the little launch
in which he sat passed each ship of the
squadron the sides were manned, the
drums were rolled, the bugles blown
and the officers at the ways saluted.
Upon the return of the launch to the
Olympia, the jackstaff from which his
flag fluttered was taken down by Ad
miral Dewey's orders, and these formal
ceremonies were thus omitted â another
proof of the admiral's Innate modesty.
Then there were other .official visits
between officers of the fleet, and these
continued without interruption for two
hours. One of the admiral's first acts
was to dispatch Flag Lieutenant
Brumby with his compliments to the
Mayor ..f New York and to apprise him
officially of the admiral's arrival.
Rear Admiral Howison's appearance
in the harbor will in no way interfere
with the programme for Friday. It
will be carried out as arranged, except
that his flagship, if it should join the
parade, will follow the Olympia instead
of Rear Admiral Sampson's flagship
New York. But it is not certain that
Admiral Howison will take part. He
is reported to have said this afternoon
that he and his crew were just in after
their long journey and preferred to rest
and clean up their travel-stained ship.
If he should ride in the laud parade on

At sunset the ersigns came fluttering
down from all the ships, the crews and
officers faced the flag and the national
airs sounded over the waters. The twi
light faded and strings of signal Hght3
twinkled on the flagship as orders were
sent danointr down the line. The fleet
lay all shining in light. The excursion
boats with their crowds of sightseers
continued to circle around the Olympia
until the bugle sounded taps and the
lights went out.
MOST BRILLIANT
ILLUMINATION OF
THE NARROWS
NEW YORK, Sept. 27.â Viewed from
the shore skirting Staten Island or Bay
Ridge, the Narrows took on the ap
pearance to-night of a big water fete,
a Venetian carnival which might have
been taken for a great canal formed by
revenue cutters and warships, begin
ing with the Olympia at St. George and
ending with the Onondaga lying off the
quarantine. Between this line of beau
tifully lighted warships and Staten Isl
and shore darted brilliantly illuminated
launches carrying prettily gowned
women and occasionally a party of
naval officers resplendent in gold braid
ed dress uniforms. The searchlights of
the ships chased many of these elusive
water greyhounds, as they scurried
thither and hither in and out among
the warships, Estopping at the gangway
of one ship and then hurrying to an
other, the ladies hogging at each to be
permitted to p> on hoard, and laughing
ly protesting when the obdurate officer
of the watch talked of iron naval rules
which forbade visitors on the ships af
ter 4 o'clock.
The Olympia was the center of at
traction. The varl-colored lights used
for signaling were kept constantly
flashing from ship to ship, and at
stated intervals a long succession of
colored lights would flash out like a
sudden display of fireworks, when a
number of the vessels would simultan
eously send messages to the guardship.
The most unique illumination along the
shores of the harbor was the effective
display at quarantine boarding station
above the Narrows. It consisted of
the words. "Welcome Home," in white
electric lights, with a border of blue
and white and an immense American
fliig, 14 feet by 25 feet, set in an illum
inated frame of hundreds of white elec
tric bulbs. This display was visible all
over the bay and attracted the atten
tion of all the ships, besides an im
mense concourse of Staten Islanders
and visitors who invaded the quarantine
grounds. Another unique illumination
was that placed on the slope overlook
ing the quarantine and consisting of
a string of alternate American flags
and pennants suspended from a center
pole bearing three large arc light? cov
ered with red. white and blue globes.
Very little r?A fire was burned to
night, the residents preferring to wait
until Friday night, when the general il
lumination of the coast will take place.

VAST THRONGS
CROWD STREETS
OF NEW YORK
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â Thousands of
eager sightseers crowded Broadway to
day, with their eyes fixed upon the
Th 'V--V arch, which is now rapidly near-
Ing completion. It is announced that
irrow the final touches will be put
on th> Btructure, and that to-morrow
will witness the disappearance of the
I screens. As the task
of th-' modelers in white Btaff nears its
end th>.- more Interested the passers-by
become. The police also show good
natured forbearance in the handling of
crowds stuffed in wh<-n the current be
comes congested Before tho Fifth
Avenue Hotel and the Hoffman House
it is Impossible to pass in less than ten
minutes. Many of the sightseers were
women on shopping tours, and school
girls. They kept their eyes fastened on
the winged victory at the top of the
.irch and lingered ns long as they could.
Onlookers find something extremely
fascinating in watching modelers put
ting the finishing touches upon the fig
urea of heroic size which adorn the
panels of the arch and columns at
eith< r end nf the approach. On the
group entitled "T\Â» Call to Arms"
the sculptor, Philip Martini, was still
busy. He had fashioned a group in its
full pizo out in his place in the country
and to-day he was putting together tho
pieces. Several of the sections were
broken, however, and work was delay
td. Mr. Martini expects to finish the
group to-morrow.
Nowhere could one obtain a better
idea of the magnitude of the present
occasion th.-in by a walk in Fifth Ave
nue this afternoon. Pavements wpre
filled from curb to â¢ dge of grandstands.
Grandstands and boardol Btoops were
everywhere. Nearly all the standards
and banners and gilt flgun-s which fur
nish an approach to tho arch from
Thirty-fourth street are completed.
When the approach Is finished to-mor
row part of Fifth Avenue will look like
a medieval city in carnival time. White
and blue streamers, green garlands,
glistening ; â  destals, gilt eagles with
spread wings, all will combine in giv
ing the avenue a gala day picturi b<lU< -
The crowd stopped along the line
of standards and watched the painters
and modelers at work.
If the throngs which filled the avenue
are an earnest of the crowds on the
day of th'- parade, there will be a solid
wall of humanity along the route. Even
fakers vith their programmes, flags,
helmets and buttons found difficulty to
day in plying their trade. It required
Ingenuity to keep their wares from be
ing brushed out of their hands and
trampled under foot.
Decorations were being put up all
over the city to-day. Large American
flags were placed over Broadway at in- 1
tervals, and thousands of smaller ban
ners made their first appearance. Por
traits of Dewey with variations, the re
sult of hasty painting, were Been over
many -a door. Old Trinity put on broad
stripes of blue and white, and th^ pil
lars of St. Paul were swathed In tri
colored bunting. Standards bearing
dragoons appeared in Chinatown, and
th flag of Italy was seen waving side
by side with the stars and stripes.
Stands for the sale of souvenirs were
'Stablished throughout tho city, and va
cant stores were utilized as headquar
ters for the army of programme ven
ders.
Down on the water front the ends of
piers wore decked in Hags and festoons.
Ferryboats carried flags, and each
craft which came across the river or
bay yesterday brought eager and ex
pectant visitors to tho city.
In all parts of New York the work of
building stands continues. Fifty-eight
implications for permits to erect stands
were made u>-day to the Building De
partment A Builder Inspector was de
tailed to every two or three blocks to
that the stands were being con
structed according to specifications and
rtith due regard for safety.
COLONEL SHAW'S
PLEA FOR GRAND
ARMY VETERANS
I
TOPEKA, Kans., Sept. 27.âCom
n!:imler-in-Chief Albert D. Shaw of the
Grand Army of the Republic spoke to
day at the State encampment and was
accorded a rousing reception. During
the day Colonel Shaw denied the pub
lished stories that he desired to head
the Dewey parade.
"These stories are Infamously false,"
he said. "I never thought of such a
thing. I wanted an escort of 2000 old J
soldiers to be a guard of honor to the â¢
admiral and to follow him in the
parade."
Later Colonel Shaw issued a state
ment to the public submitting facts
"in justification of requests made to I
Major General Roe that the veterans
be allowed to have the right of line
in the Dewey parade." Colonel Shaw
cites as precedents the place accorded
the veterans at the Chicago Jubilee and
at the reception to the Tenth Regiment
Pennsylvania Volunteers at Plttsburg
and adds:
"In the light f>f these comparatively
recent parades, the latter >n honor of
our gallant soldiers who served ln the
Philii pines and who possibly heard
some of Admiral Dewey's guns, I could
not but fuel that the Grand Army com
rades of New York, as representative
of the greatest State of the Union,
which sent more men than any other i
State to preserve the nation from ruin,
were as richly entitled to head the line
of the Dewey parade as were the com- j
rades of Pennsylvania to lead a simi- j
lar civic pageant in honor of our Span
ish-American war heroes. It gives me j
great pleasure to extend to Governor
Roosevelt, as the commander-in-chief
of 350,000 veterans of the Grand Army
of the Republic, a warm congratula
tion on the just and patriotic stand he
has taken in behalf of the aging veter
ans of the nation, in using his influence I
to have their just request granted that
they lead the parade in the city of New
York in honor of the great Admiral
Dewey, thus assuring to our newest
veterans that when they grow old in
their turn they shall not be the tail
of any public procession."
Ohio guardsmen
are saved from
disappointment!
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 27.â For a
time to-day the proposed trip of tho
Ohio National Guard to New York to
participate in the Dewey celebration
wfis abandoned, but owing to the gen
.-r"=<ty of Governor Bushnell and John
R. McLean the trip will be made as
proposed. All arrangements had been
completed when, at a late hour last
night. Attorney General Monnett gave
an opinion that the funds of the State j
could not be used for defraying the ex
penses of the trip, and on the strength !
of that the adjutant general issued an I
order which knocked the whole thing in j
the head. When Mr. McLean heard of
the failure of the affair he called Gov
ernor Bushnell up by telephone and in- I
sisted that it would not do to have
Ohio unrepresented. He and the Gov
ernor then agreed to guarantee the ex
penses of the trip ln case there Bhould
be any difficulty in getting the money
from the State treasury.

REPORTS FROM CALCUTTA
SEVERAL DISTRICTS INUNDATED
BY THE DOWNPOUPw.
Natives Working With Horses to
Clear the Roads While the Mun
ster Regiment Searches
for Bodies.
SDecial Diwstcb to. The Call.
CALCUTTA, Sept. 27.â The great
storm of Sunday and Monday which
caused destructive landslides and floods
gathered at the head of the bay of Cal
cutta and then* moved north, giving
heavy rain in Calcutta, Dinajapur,
Rangpur and Jalpaiguri. Its greatest
' fury was felt" at Darjeeling. Simul
j taneously another storm gathered at
Rangrpur and passed westward from
Puma to Mongbyr. The usual weekly
reports have not been received by the
Government and there is reason to fear
thai the district named is flooded and
communication Interrupted.
It was estimated that between Dar-
Jeeling and Kurseong alone 300 persons
have lust their lives.
The line between Darjeeling and So
nada will be blocked probably for two
months. Both the upper and lower
Puglojhoras have been carried away.
A number of bodies have beoai re
covered on the Happy Valley estate.
The soldiers of the Munster Regiment
are searching for bodies and clearing ;
I the roads.
It is reported that the Teosta suspen- |
sioii bridge has been broken away by |
the floods and that Kaliinpong is then -
fore out off from communication. Gangs
of natives with horses are working to
clear the roads. The storm appears to j
have extended all over the northern
portion of Bengal,
Considerable damage has also been j
done at Sillguri, where a number of
wooden huts and the plague camp have
been destroyed. The subsidence of the j
hillside at Darjeeling continues and is j
causing alarm, as it threatens to de
stroy the \\ hole Liazaar.
Although the delayed reports from
many sections prevent accurate esti
mates, it is evident that the total fatal
ities far exceed 300. No fewer than 200 ;
persons were killed in the destruction j
of the Phool Bazaar alone, and as many j
as 100 at Darjeeling.
Twenty-one bodies have been recov
ered at Tamsongbatee, where it is be
lieved that another twenty persons j
have been killed. Advices from Rungli
show great destruction in the tea gar
dens around Poomong on Monday
night. The landslides continued over
th< Uungaroon forest, the constant roar
alarming the inhabitants.
FIGHT TO BREAK
MILLS WILL BEGINS
! The First Day Consumed in the
Drawing of a
Jury.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 27.â The
fight for the Mills fortune is now on ln,
the Superior Court at this place. The
! matter has been pending in one form
! or another for the past two years. The
suit promises to be one of the most sen
sational and most bitterly fought con
testa ever known in the history of the
j county.
Robert Mills died in this county in
j 1837. leaving a widow, two sifters and a
number of nephews and nieces. He left
no children. Now come Robert Scho
! field Chatham and Maria Elizabeth
I Chatham (Jardiner and claim to be the
J illegitimate children of Mills and Mrs.
' Chatham. By reason of the alleged re
, lationship these two seek to have two-
I thirds of the estate distributed to them.
A Jury was to-day chosen and sworn
in to try the issues of the case. The
i taking of testimony will bf-gin to-mor
i row morning at 9:30 o'clock and will
; probably consume the balance of this
i week and the whole of next and possi
-1 bly longer. \
The attorneys representing the
plaintiffs are Edward F. Fitzpatrick
and George C. Ross of this place and
Wilson & Wilson of San Francisco.
John E. Richards and John G. Jury of
San Jose, A. Kincaid of this place and
H. A. Powell of San Francisco repre
sent the defense. The jury is composed
of J. H. O'Keefe, A. J. Beer, M. Moran,

SAW RANDALL SHOT.
Sensational Testimony of Mrs. Eades
at Pendleton's Hearing.
BEDDING, Sept 27.â John P.-udleton,
the miner held for the- shooting of Jake
Randall on a disputed claim, near Kes
wick, had his preliminary examination
here to-day and was held to answer for
murder.
A sensation was sprung at the examina
tion by Mrs. Ida Eades. Pendleton claims
that Randall made a movement as if to
draw a gun and then he shot him. Mrs.
Eadee testified she was standing on the
porch of a building several hundred yards
away watching Randall climb the hill. As
he passed the eubin, she says, she saw
him throw up his hands, stagger and fall
and she then saw Bmoke and heard a re
port. It had been supposed that there
were no witnesses to the tragedy. Mrs,
Eadee was searchingiy examined, but
clung to her statement, which tends to
show that the killing was cold-blooded.

FUTURE OF
THE STATE
UNIVERSITY
Professor Benjamin Ide
Wheeler Tells Something
About His Plans.
BRILLIANT PROSPECT
The California Inst tution Destined
to Hoid a Leading Placi Among
the Colleges oi the World.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Sept. 27.â Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, new president of the Univer
: sity of California, left Chicago' this
afternoon for Berkeley, Cal., accom
panied by Mrs. Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler
was called from the chair of Greek at
Cornell University last spring by the
Californians to become the head of
, their State institution.
Professor Wheeler is enthusiastic
over his new work and speaks in the
I warmest terms of the coast institution
lof learning. He will continue the pres
ent ideas of the university, one of the
; chiefest and most interesting of which
looks to the increase of power of th 6
State as representative of a great sec
tion of the nation.
"I am much pleased with the pros
pect before me," he said just before
leaving for the Northwestern depot
to catch the overland train. "The
University of California even now
ranks hi.^h among the great seats of
learning in this country, it is, how
ever, I believe, destined to forge much
farther ahead. Through the generosity
of Mrs. Hearst the institution is as
sured of magnificent new quarters.
General plans for new buildings have
been drawn, as you know, and work
will go ahead rapidly. The first build
ing to be erected will be that of the
mining and engineering department. I
cannot say positively when work on
this structure will commence, but it
will be very soon.
"While the work on this is going on
architects will be completing plans and
drawings for other buildings and these
will be taken up in order. The esti
mated coast of the buildings is between
$7,000,000 and $10,000,000. There will be
no trouble about funds; I feel sure of
that. The people of California are in
tensely devoted to the State institution,
and there will be ample money forth
coming for all contemplated work.
"It will be one of the aims of the
university for a considerable time to
promote the interests of the State in
lines of diplomacy and commerce. Cal
ifornia may be said to represent the
great western shore of this country. As
such its place is beside the State of
New York as a commerce promoter.
Yes. it is even ahead of that State, for
New York must divide her strength in
this district with many other common
wealths. California, however, stretch
ing fipr hundreds of miles along the
Pacific Ocean and standing as care- !
taker of commerce with the Eastern
world, has felt she roust rear men pe
culiarly Qualified in commerce and di
plomacy that she may fitly serve the i
purp< sOs of the nation."
McKENZIE'S TRIAL.
Eighteen Witnesses Examined but No
New Facts Brought Out.
BUIBUN, Sept. 27.â At the McKenzie
trial to-day the first witness of Impor
tance was I. Metcalf. who stood by Mc-
Kenzie in the stable at the time it was
alleged Walters shot Cook. Witness
heard shots, but immediately left the j
premises. The next witness testified as |
to seeing Walters leaving the stable in a
limpingoondition. Sheriff Dunlap was next
called and testified that he took the cloth- i
Ing and effects of Cook to his office nnd
there examined them without notification
to defendant's attorney. Defense objected
to the clothing and effects being offered
in evidence, and the objection was sus
tained.
I oroner Keyser was the next witness
He admitted under cross-examination
that the clothing worn by Cook at the
time of the homicide ha<l been burned the
flay after the killing and could not he
offered in evidence. Drs. Osborn and
Hauhn of Napa testified as to the condi
tion of the body of Cook at the autopsy
performed by them. Another witness ad
mitted In cross-examination that he had
solicited subscriptions to secure the ser
vices of a prominent attorney to aid the
prosecution. Nothing of a sensational
nature, has as yet developed. Eighteen
witnesses were examined during the day.
Costly Torpedo Recovered.
BAUSAX.ITO, Sept. 27. -The torpedo
which was lost while the sailors aboard
the torpedo-boat destroyer Farragut were
engaged ii practice work last week \v;is
found yesterday. It was buried in three
feet of mini and was located with a steel
rod in the hands of a diver after a search
lasting rive days. The torpedo Is worth
$3000 and would have been no trifling loss
to Incle Sam if the divers had not
found it.
Died From a Beating.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 27.-Frank Mc-
Donald, a laborer, died at the County
Hospital to-night from the efforts of a

ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY.
George H. Maxwell of California i
Elected National Lecturer and
Member of the Executive

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MISSOULA. Mont.. Sept. 27.â The Na
tional Irrigation Congress has finished j
its eighth annual session and adjourned
to meet next year ln Chicago, the date
to be fixed by the executive committee, j
There was but one dissenting' vote in j
the resolution urging the reclamation
of the arid lands, indicating that the j
West is at last united upon this great
work.
At the morning session to-day a pa
per by Professor Fortier of the Mon
tana State College of Agriculture was i
read, presenting in an able manner the
subject of settlement of water right
difficulties.
Judge Stillwell of Arizona said that
he believed that the time had come
when the tilling of the soil in these ;
arid land States should be taken out of j
the hands of tho lawyers, and that now '
irrigation regulations are necessary, j
This matter was discussed by several I
other delegates, and a motion finally !
prevailed t<> refer the paper to the com
mittee on resolutions.
Ex-Governor McCord nf Arizona de- i
livered a twenty minutes address upon j
the needs and conditions of arid re- I
gions. Governor McCord's Introduction
dealt briefly with the development of
the reclamation of arid lands, and hia
description of what ha.s been done was
comprehensive and complete. At the
conclusion of Governor MeCord's ad
dress the conference adjourned till 1:30 :
in the afternoon.
The afternoon session was opened by
the delivery of an able paper on the
conservation of water supply, by J. B.
Collins of Montana, superintendent of
the forest reserve system in Montana.
Professor J. W. Toumy of Arizona,
representing the national forestry divi- !
sion, read an important paper upon the |
general object of forest reserve sys
tem. At the conclusion of Professor
Toumy's paper the report of the com
mittee on nominations was received j
and adopted unanimously, the secre
tary casting the vote of the congress
for the following officers:
President, Elwood Mead, Wyoming:
vice president, S. M. Emery, Montana:
second vice president. L. W. Shurtlieff, I
Utah; third vice president, C. B. Hurtt,
Idaho; secretary, H. B. Maxson, Ne
vada.
On motion, George H. Maxwell of

turer and ex-officio a member of the

M'KINLEY'S WESTERN TRIP.
J Bryanites Say He Will Come for Po
litical Reasons.
OMAHA, Sept. 27.â 0n behalf of the
managers of the Greater America Expo
! sition. Senator Thiirston and Edward
Rosewater callod upon President McKin
-1 ley at the White, House yesterday and
i tendered a formal invitation to the Presl
' dent to visit Omaha upon his proposed
tour into Minnesota and South Dakota..
A Washington dispatch Bays the Presi
dent is disposed to accept. This announce
ment has angered the Bryanite news
paper in Omaha, which says:
"As a matter of fact, the effort to take
McKinley into Nebraska is political and
i the invitation is in reality a Macedonian
cry from Republican campaign managers
>in Nebraska. Bryan's brilliant campaign j
in Nebraska is arousing so much Demo- !
cratic enthusiasm that the administration j
is besought to help in counteracting it."
The exposition managers resent this at
tack.
Cold Storage Plant.
MARYSVILLE, Sept. 27.-Ground has
been broken for an artificial ice and cold
storage plant that will occupy the lots
iat the corner of A and Ninth streets
1 heretofore known as the c oughlan nurs

! pacity when business warrants. A swim- 1

A VERY DEEP GAME
Trying to Make Good Treatment of
American Prisoners a Card
by Which to Gain Out
side Sympathy.
MANILA. Sept. 28, 10 a. m.â Generals Mac Arthur, "Wheaton and
Wheeler, with four regiments and a battery, advanced at daybreak this
morning upon Porac, about eight miles northwest of Bacolor, in Pam
pant;a province.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28.â The movement of Generals Mac Arthur,
Wheaton ai â '. Wheeler on Po-rac, as reported by cable from Manila to
' night, if:' what fh>> War has been anticipating for the last
- fortnight. The general plans of this movement are known to the offi
- dais, bul they have refused to give out dispatches on this subject for
- fear tho enemy would profit by the information. The rainy weather
- delayed the movement. It is known to the War Department that a
. considerable force of the enemy is in the vicinity of Porac and the
â â¢ai idea, it is believed. Is to break up the defenses which the in
surgents have prepared during th.> rainy season in order that their
forces may be weakened when tho time comes for a more extensive
campaign. General Otis' purpose, as understood at the department, is to
make short military detours whenever the weather permits, but it is
not expected that there will be a general advance all along the line be
fore some time in November. Porac Is situated fourteen miles from
Bacolor and has a population of 8500.
MANILA, Sept. 27.â The Insurgents
are trying to incite the natives of
Matabon, a city of 30,000 Inhabitants,
live miles from Manila, to rise against
the American garrison. Captain Allen
has been holding: the place with two
companies of the Sixteenth Infantry.
but on account of the need- of all avail

they are quartered, being too few In

The armed uniformed. parties of insur

night, collected money for the insur

Mayors have, been elected, but both
of them have declined to serve. Mata

Aguinaldo has issued a decree invit

THE SAIST FBAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1899.
SIR WALTER PIERCE SAYS
WAR IS INEVITABLE
Occupation of Laing's Neck Is Considered as an
Act of Hostility and the First Shot
May Be Fired Any Day.
Bloemfontein, the Capital of the Orange Free State,
Which will be the capital of the United Republics in case the proposed annexation of the Transvaal to the Orange
Free State is effected.
LONDON, Sept. 27.â Notices for
the adjourned Cabinet council
were forwarded this afternoon
and the chief Government whip
will be on hand to give imrae
i dlate effect to any decision arrived at
I regarding the reassembling of Parlia
ment.
Information from Bloemfontein this
I evening leaves little doubt that the
J Orange Fr,ee State Volksraad Is unani
| mous in supporting the Transvaal.
Most important light is shown upon j
the situation by a frank statement to
day by Sir Walter Pierce, agent gen
eral for Natal in London, who fought
against the Boers in former years. He :
! said: "The attitude of the Orange Free I
I tftate means its inevitable acquisition
! by Great Britain. Peace in South j
i Africa can only be accomplished by j
I war. In my opinion a war would not j
I last more than two months. In order \
Ito make pacification effective Great j
| Britain must assume absolute control j
i over the whole of South Africa.
"So far as the position of Natal is
concerned all this talk about poor, un
defended Natal is nonsense. There will
be little or no lighting in Natal if it
; comes to a war, and I fear that no j
other issue is now possible. What do
you think 10.0W British troops would
be doing while this much-talked-of
Boer raid was in progress? Our rall
i ways are in good working order and ;
I our troops can be transported quickly. !
The bad weather conditions have been
magnified. A campaign could be car
ried on now just as well as in any other ,
season.
"Two months from the day Sir Red
i vers Buller lands the fighting will be
I over. If the Free State had been loyal !
! fighting would not have lasted fourteen '
days. It is the likeliesi thing in the i
world, however, that the Free State
will be foolish enough to take a hostile :
attitude, for that means her addition
to British possessions. The Free State
would always have beer* a disturbing
factor in the quiet of South Africa.
"Gr^at Britain has the power to work
: out ultimate peace. It remains to be
B< .11 whether she has the spirit. Upon ;
i the conclusion of war, which must be !
'â . unflinching in order to be effective.
British contAil must be absolute over â 
i all South Africa, in Cape Colony, Natal
' and other sections. Half measures
: , would only prolong unrest and produce
: more disturbances.
"I have known the Boers as well as
i any man. I have lived among them
! and I have fought them. To exist peace
! fully so close to them is an utter im
possibility. Negotiations are well
enough in their way, but British con- ;
trol of the Transvaal must come event-
I ually. For years the Boers have been j
ciying: 'Throw the Outlander into the I
sea!' and 'Out with him!' Possibly
they were not so virile as during the j
last war, but there is little difference, j
My idea is that If the Boers were !
caught in the open once or twice the j
thing would be ended. Kill live hun
dred of them, and all that would re
main for England to do would be to
i send a few shiploads of crape. They j
i never stood in the open, and if war !
i comes now they will have to do more
than stay in the hills. This is not opti- !
! mistlc. but an opinion based upon my i
I experience in campaigns against the
Boers. I have not the slightest fears '
i for the safety of my colony or its towns.
It is possible that a few Boer incur
sions might get a few miles into Natal,
but no farther, and it must be remem
bered that many of those living on the
! edge of the Natal border are them
i selves Boers."
A few days may witness a definite
development ln the crisis in the Trans- ,
vaal. The Volksraad assembled in se- |
cret session to-night, and the burghers :
doubtless had the result of the dellb- j
erations of the Orange Free State
Volksraad to guide them in making a
decision as to the reply to Mr. Cham
berlain's latest report, which will prob
ably be handed to the British diplo
matic agent at Pretoria, Mr. Conyng- |
ham Greene, and be discussed by the .
British Cabinet to-morrow.
The Secretary of State for "War, the |
Marquis of Landsdowne, was busy un- ]
til a late hour last evening at the war i
office. A telegram from Naples shows j
that the British Government Is buying
mules there, as well as in thÂ« United
States. It is understood that 10.000 will j
be purchased altogether, but as it will
take at least a month to get them to j
Africa and a similar time to get an |
army corps to the front it is evident
that big operations will be impossible
until toward the end of October.
It is understood that the British note j
will virtually demand the absolute ful- '
fillment of the conventions of 1881 and |
18S4. which have been violated in nu- j
merous points, but will accept a five !
years' limit for the franchise.
According to the Pretoria correspond
ent of the Daily Chronicle It is believed j
in the highest quarters there that a
settlement Ib even yet possible If Great
Britain will propose moderate terms
and at the same time make it clearly j
understood that these will be regarded
as final.
Other dispatches from South Africa,
however, anticipate that President
Kruger will continue obdurate and rep
resent the situation as of the gravest
character. Dispatches from Pretoria
and Johannesburg speak of the proba
bility of hostilities within a week. One
correspondent says:
"British subjects will be given a cer
tain period within which to quit the
country. If they desire to remain they
must make application to that effect
and the application will be considered
on its merks."
Another correspondent says: "Four
thousand rifles and a quantity of am
munition have just arrived at Johan
nesburg: and are beins distributed by
the field cornets. The burghers of Pre
toria, 4000 in number, are equipped and
awaiting the order to advance."
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Dully News says: "The pass of Laingrs
Nek will be occupied to-morrow with
sufficient strength for present needs,
under the belief that the Boers will at
tack Natal immediately, hoping to fore
stall the landing of the Indian con
tingent."
The Daily Telegraph publishes the
following from its correspondent in
Cape Town: "I regret to note a uni
versal opinion that war is very near.
Kvcrywhere the Boers are active and
bellicose. They are arming, equipping
and storing supplies for a protracted
struggle.
"The Transvaal Government has
failed in an attempt to purchase 10,000
sacks of wheat hero, but Boer agents
are scouring South Africa to buy cam
paign provisions. Proof accumulates
i if the exirter.ee of a great Dutch con
spiracy against Rritlsh supremacy in
South Africa. The Free State is be
lieved to be involved, and there Is no
doubt that the Orange Government is
Intent upon war. Many Boers in the
northern districts of Cape Colony are
joining our probable enemy. The Dutch
republics will together be able to mus
ter 35.000 men, nearly all mounted. I
loam that the Orange Free State has
decided to put 10,000 men into the field."
An American, J. C. Howell, has been
appointed editor of the Johannesburg
Star, in the absence of Mr. Money
penny, who crossed the border in order
to evade a warrant issued for his ar
rest by the Transvaal authorities. Im
medlately upon war being declared
both the Star and the Transvaal Leader
will be suppressed. Several other
Johannesburg papers have already sus
pended publication.
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: "The Boers, I believe,
will construe the occupation of Laings
Nek as an act of hostility. British mem
bers of the Cape Town House of As
sembly freely criticize England's un
preparedness and predict a serious re
verse, followed by grave risings of
colonists in the adjoining republics,
namely at Alberta. Aliwal North,
Burghersdorp, Colesberg, Hanover and
other places to the northward, which
have been well armed by the republic.
This is no fairy tale, but an honest
opinion of members of Parliament here.
There has been an enormous run on re
volvers. The price of Mnusers has ad
vanced from Â£7 to Â£22. Supplies of all
kinds are quickly bought up. President
Pit yn. it is reported, is about to send
his family to the Tape."
BLOEMFONTEIN, Sept. 27.â The
Volksraad of the Orange Free State has
unanimously resolved to instruct the
Government to use every means to in
sure peace without violating the honor
or Independence of the Free State or
the Transvaal. In a further resolution
the Volksraad declared its opinion* that
war would be criminal, but asserted
that come what might, the Free State
would faithfully fulfill its obligations to
the Transvaal in virtue of the existing
political alliance.

CONVENTION OF
PRESBYTERIANS
Resolutions Opposing
Church Taxation.
Special Dlspatc-h to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 27.â The Pres
byterian ministers of riouthern Cali
fornia are in session at the East Los
Angeles Presbyterian Church. The
first meeting of the session was largely
attended. An address by Rev. Dr.
Wlnton of the San Francisco Theo
logical Seminary was listened to with
close attention. Devotional exercises
preceded the business meeting this
morning, many prominent ministers of
Southern California taking part.
The resignation of Rev. E. S. Fer
rand, who has considered a call from
| the River Forest (111.) church, was ac
j cepted. to take effect November 1. In
his letter he says it is not necessary
to refer to the circumstances of sep
j aration, the death of his wife com
j pelling him to live near Eastern rela
! tives.
Rev^Mr. Bovard presented the cause of
relieving churches from taxation.
Speaking of the situation in San Fran
cisco, he said that he had heard com
plaints from Protestants to the effect
that if the church tax were repealed
the Catholics would be the greatest
beneficiaries.
"And what of that?" said the speak
er. "I would not be guilty of asking
that the Methodist and Presbyterian
churches be relieved of tax if the Cath
olic churches must still bear the bur
den. Men have a right to their re
ligious convictions, and we must reach
them, if at all, through tolerance and
brotherly love."

CARACAS, Sept. 27.â An attempt was
make to blow up the building of the
foreign office to-day. Fortunately but
little damage was done to the structure.
No one was in the offices as it was
lurch time.
PORT OF SPAIN, Sept. 27.â Caracas
is practically invested by the revolu
tionists. General Cipriano Castro's
forces, moving from Valencia and Vic
toria, have separated into three divi
sions. The right wing has already cap
tured San Casimlro and Ocumare and
is now occupying the valley of the Tuy
River and commanding the road to
Caracas, which is thirty miles distant.
The left wing is occupying Cara Lucia
and the entire sea coast to Puerto Ca
bello and is moving toward Laguayra
with the special object of cutting off
the escape of President Andrade. The
center and main division of the rebel
army, under the personal command of
General Castro, is moving on Los
Tequcs and Puposes to combine with
the forces from Tuy Valley to make an
assault on Caracas.
General Castro suprised the Govern
ment troops on the plains of Valencia,
causing the loss to Andrade's forces of
1500 men in killed and wounded. Gen
eral Adrian of the Government army
was among the slain. The loss of the
revolutionists was slight.
The province of Cara Bobo is now
held by the insurgents. The city of
Carupano has taken up arms in favor
of the revolution. It is believed that
President Andrade has sent his family
on the steamship Philadelphia to New
York, he having ordered the Philadel
phia by dispatch from Curacoa.
The Government of Trinidad has is
j sued a proclamation against filibuster
' ing expeditions, threatening severe pen
alties. It is believed that another ex
pedition is being fitted out here for
Venezuela.

EBENEZER WORMOUTH
COMMITS SUICIDE
THE LATE EBENfcZER WORMOUTH.
MILL VALLEY, Sept. 27.â Ebenez-^r Wormouth. the capitalist, who came
near dying recently as the result of trtking an overdose of morphine,
committed suicide to-day by hanging himself with a bale rope from the
closet In bis bedroom. When the body was discovered by
Dr. Mays shortly before noon life was extinct," and an injection of
Strychnine and artificial respiration failed to bring the old man back to
the w^rld of the livinc.
About U o'clock this morning Mrs. Levison, the nurse and housekeeper, left
him alone and went to several stores to purchase gome provisions. When she
returned Bhe found Dr. Mays waiting to enter the house on his regular daily
visit. The twu wont to the bedroom door and knocked, but received no response.
On trying the door it was found to be locked. This was so unusual a circum
stance that Mrs. Levison ran outside and looked in the window. She thought
she saw the old man k-aning against the closet door, and told Dr. Mays about it.
The physician â  ler and entered the room through the window.
He found the i - rer had banged himself.
A bale rope had been fastened to the inner knob of the door, passed over the
top i ! around his neck. On the jamb of the door Mr. Wormouth had
a mark with a l< ad pen< H on a level with his head, so that he would make
no mistake. N>ar by was a small stool which he had stood on and kicked to one
side when he was ready. The- tips of his toes were touching the floor. Dr. Mays
cut down the body and tried to restore life, but found that be had arrived too late.
Wormouth's neck was badly lacerated by the small rope he had used in ending his
life.
ner Eden was notified, and arrived this afternoon from San Rafael. An
Inquest was held, the verdict of the jury being that the deceased came to his
d*-; th by bis own hands. Wormouth's brother and nephew reside in Stockton, and
other relatives in the East. The place of burial has not yet been decided upon.
He leaves a fortune variously estimated at from $50,000 to $100,000, which is com
ln pari of property In this city, 9an Rafael. Sausallto and Port Costa. It
is believed that he committed suicide because his mind had become deranged
from b aff< ting.
"Old Ned," as he was familiarly called, has become famous on account of his
legal battle with the Gardners over forty acres of land, which has been waged in
the courts for fifteen years and has cost both parties to the suit something like
$40,000â more than the land is really worth. He made a provision in his will by
which JSOOO is left to the executor, L. H. Bonestell, to carry on the suit against
his opponents.
Two years ago Wormouth was sandbagged and robbed at his residence. Last
summer his house was looted of valuables while he was in Sausalito. He was
very miserly in his habits, and never wore anything but overalls for trousers. He
had b< en suffering with cancer of the stomach for several months.

ASKS FOR JUDICIAL TRIAL
ATTACKS FORMER SECRETARY
OF WAR ALGER.
Declares That Many Statements
Given Out hy the Department
Were Falsehoods Invented
for a Purpose.
.-; .nl DUpfttCb to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27.â Attorney
General Gri?:?s to-, lay gave a hearing
to Hon. Wayne MacVeagh, counsel in
the court-martial case of Captain Car
ter of the army. Mr. MacVeagh asked
for a judicial hearing in the case, say
ing that if the President affirmed the
proceedings he would be guilty of an
if great cruelty and wrong. The
record was, he contended, so saturated
with errors of law that it is impossible
in a country governed by law to aifirm
the finding.
Before proceeding with his argument
proper he corrected what he described
as erroneous reports concerning the
case. The first of these to which he
gave his attention was a statement that
Secretary Alger had allowed the attor
ney fur Captain Carter to take away
and keep possession of the record in the
case. This was, he said, absolutely un
truo. The counsel for the accused had
never seen th<? original record, and had
received no favors.
It was also false that the represent
i&V.U v \ OwUA Wnjn A . / â¼ MMÂ«
1/ CHARLES IVJEINECKE S
Â§) sawVrawcisco. cal. J^jl J
atives of Captain Carter had im
portuned the President in the captain's
behalf. On the contrary the only pres
j sure brought to bear upon the Presi
j dent was from the ether side for the
affirmation of the finding. He recited
eleven instances in what he termed
positive inventions retailed to the cor
respondents of the newspapers during
the past eighteen months. Sooner or la
ter he expected to reveal the authors of
j these reports and expose their motives
j and then to hold somebody responsible
I for proving their truth. He had thought
I of asking the new Secretary of War t<Â»
| signalize his entrance upon his duties
i by posting this notice over the doors
of two of the divisions of the depart
ment: "No falsehoods shall be dis
seminated from this office during office
hours."
Mr. MacVeagh also denied that the
finding of the court had been unani
mous, notwithstanding, he said, that
| the War Department had so stated.
In asking that the court-martial ver
j diet be set aside Mr. MacVeagh urged
| the unfitness of such a court, composed
of men untrained in law, to deal with
questions such as those Involved in this
case. The findings of such a court have
no validity and carry no weight. The
findings were based on a jumble of In
congruous and discordant charges,
ranging from embezzlement and deceit
| in the smallest matters to charges of
j conspiracy of Immense magnitude.

SENSATIONAL
EVIDENCE IN
HITE CASE
Millionaire Always Intro
duced the Indian Woman
as His Wife.
WILCOX'S TESTIMONY
All the Witnesses Examined During
the Day Gave Evidence Favor
able to the Prosecution.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARIPOSA, Sept. 27.â The long ex
pected sensation in the Hite divorce
case arrived this afternoon. It was
personified in Wilcox, a man of Her
culean build, though bent with age. He
had a gray mustache a foot long and
a nerve that not even Attorney Foote's
caustic sarcasm and threatening could
feaze.
He had a story to tell and he told it,
though at one time a general free fight
seemed imminent. Wilcox has be-.-n in
the Legislature five times, three times
as a Republican and twice as a Demo
crat, and has during all that time been
on friendly terms with John R. Hite,
the millionaire defendant in the divorce
suit.
He frequently visited Kite's Cove
ranch, and saw Lucy Hite there. Wil
cox said that Hite had always treated
plaintiff as his wife. He had'seen Hite
take Lucy on his lap and call her his
dear Lucy. The sensation was brought
out by W. W. Foote's cross-examina
tion. The leading counsel for the de
fense waded right in to attack the
credibility of the witness. His games
of politics was the first mark; then he
came to his personal relations with
Hite.
Wilcox said he had warned Hite
against Mrs. Cecelia Nougues. One one
occasion, prior to last March, Hite told
him that he liked Mrs. Nougues, giving
incredible reasons. Hite said he had
sustained intimate relations with her.
and would continue to do so. He said
he could not marry her as he was al
ready married to Lucy Hite.
Witness addressed Mrs. Nougues, or
Hite, as a kept woman, in the presence
Of the defendant, after his alleged mar
riage to the lady. Foote's questions
brought out that witness first stated
that he would have nothing to do with
the case. This started a verbal fight
between the .attorneys and witness's.
Both Foote and Wilcox were belliger
ent. "I propose to conduct this exam
ination myself, without interruption by
counsel and the threatening looks of
the Marlposa blacksmith." shouted
Foote. dramatically. After the wran
gle witness said he had changed his
mind.
J. A. Wall of the plaintiff's counsel
had induced Wileox to call and see
Lucy Hite when she was in San
Francisco. He did so. He told how
the Indian woman in telling her story
of Hite's desertion cried, and described
how for many nights she would look
down the road from her ranch, expect
ing to see John returning. And this,
said the witness, so worked on his
heart and manhood that he determined
at rince to assist In righting the
wrongs of Lucy Hite.
The testimony of all the other wit
nesses examined to-day was along the
lines of establishing the relations of
John R. Hite and Lucy Hite. Their
stories agreed In the main, Hanlon and
Van R. Paterson alternating in the
direct examination.
On cross-examination by Attorney
Foote these witnesses were in some
measure confused. There were no ab
solute contradictions, however. Alto
gether this was a favorable day for thf
case of the plaintiff, who sat silently
in court while the attorneys fought and
wrangled over her case.

RUSH OF PROSPECTORS
TO OTATLAN DISTRICT
It Was Known to Be Very Rich, but
the Indians Formerly Were
Hostile.
CHILPANZIXOO. State of Ouerrero,
Mexico, Sept. 27.â The recent rich god
discoveries in the Otatl;m district, this
State, have caused several thousand
prospectors, including many Americans,
to rush Into this region in search of
wealth.
The Indians living in the mountains near
Otatlan have teen bringing large quanti
ties of almost pure gold into the settle
ments of that section for many years, but
they resisted all attempts of prospecting
parties to enter the rough territory until
recently.
A few years apo a party of threo Ameri
can prospectors entered the forbidden
region against the warning of friendly In
dians and all were murdered.

MARCONI'S PREPARATIONS
FOR THE YACHT RACES
Ponce's Big Spar Not Set, as It Would
Prevent Her From Passing Under
the Bridge.
NEW YORK, Sept. 27.â Marconi had
a busy day to-day preparing for the re
porting of the yacht races for The Call
and the New York Herald by his sys
tem of wireless telegraphy. A visit to
the first receiving station at the High
lands of Navesink and a trip to sea on
the big steamer Ponce, which is to be
one of the sending stations, occupied
his time from early morning until well
into the afternoon. The big spar on
the Ponce was not put in place yester
day, owing to its great height, which
would prevent the vessel passing under
the bridge. The steamer leaves her
Brooklyn dock Friday morning for
Pier 57, North River, and will not re
turn until after the races are con
cluded. The stick will be erected to
morrow, and on Friday Marconi ex
pects to be sending his messages
through air.
The Ponce, with a large party of
guests on board, left the Empire
Shores shortly after 12 o'clock to-day
and went down the bay. As she
passed the Olympia and the North At
lantic squadron, at anchor off Tomp
kinsvillo. she saluted each vessel in
turn. The ship was decorated with
flags and bunting, and, with her freshly
painted hull and upper works and shin
ing brass work, made a pretty picture.
The Erin, Sir Thomas Lipton's yacht,
also received a generous salute, and
then the Ponce went outside, where her
compasses were udjusted and the en
gines were given a chance to show
what they could do. On the return trip
the new ship attracted much attention

SEEKS HEAVY DAMAGES
DEFENDANT FORMER SHERIFF
OF SAN LUIS OBISPO.
*
The Woman in the Case Has Been
Married Three Times and
Has Been Twice
Divorced.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 27.â Ten thousand
dollars for alienating: the affections of
a wife 1s the basis for a s-.-nsational
suit commenced in the Superior Court
this afternoon by L. A. Cole, a Los
Gatos carpenter, against ex-Sheriff S.
D. Ballou of San Luis Obispb County.
Prior to March 12, 1897, Cole and his
wife lived happily together at Los
Gatos, where she was engaged in
teaching school. On that date she
left h<>r husband. Ballou is charged
with wrongfully contriving and intend
ing to injure plaintiff and to deprive
him of his wife's comfort, society and
aid, it being said that on the above
date he maliciously enticed Mrs. Cole
from her husband's residence in Los
Gatos to a separate residence in Ven
tura County and has ever since de
tained and harbored her against the
consent of the plaintiff. By reason of
these acts Cole alleges he has suffered
great distress of body and mind and
asks damages to the extent of $10,000.
Ballou is well known in this city and
lived here for many years, but for the
past fifteen years has been in San Luis
Obispo County, where he became one
of the most prominent citizens. Ballou
is said to be the brother-in-law of Mrs.
Cole's sister.
On July IS last Cole obtained a di
vorce from his wife in this county on
the charg*- of desertion. At that time
Cole averred that his wife had deserted
him while he was confined to his room
with a broken hip, sustained while at
â work. Sho refused to return and said
all she wanted to see of him was his
obituary notice. About $1000 of com
munity property was divided at that
time. Mrs. Cole has been married three
times. Her first husband was G.
Coyle, from whom she was divorced,
and J. H. Fuller, the second, died at
Los Gatos. Cole was third.

THE MEN FROM
SOUTH DAKOTA
A Case of Suspected
Smailpox.
IT DEVELOPED IN THE CAMP
USUAL PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO
PREVENT INFECTION.
The Thirty-Third Ordered Away on
the Sheridan and the Thirty-
Second to Go the Same
Day.
There are reports of more sickness
among the volunteer regiments, the last
case having developed among the men
of the South Dakota regiment now await
ing muster out. The case is that of
Wayne I.arrabee of Company M of the
South Da-kotas He was taken to the
general hospital yesterday morning suf
fering from a high fever. He was not in
the hospital more than a few hours be
fore he began to show symptoms of small
pox, and the fact was at onoe communi
cated to Captain Kennedy, surgeon in
charge of the lower volunteer camp, and
to Colonel Forwood, chief surgeon of the
department. Orders were issued to take
at once all precautions against danger
of the spread of the disease. Th.- ra< n
who have associated with Larrabee nave
been placed In detention and isolated, the
property belonging to them that has been
In the tent has been fumigated or de
stroyed and the tent and iloor will proba
bly also be destroyed.
Larrabee has not yet been sent out to
the detention camp, for while be has
ehuwn undoubted and developed symp
toms of the disease, the burgeons are not
willing to risk a mistake. He has been
Isolated in the hospital and those who at
tended him have, also been detained, so
there can be no harm in keeping him
there until the last moment. Should the
last doubt disappear he will be sent out
at once to the camp on the hill.
It la not known how or where Larra
"bee contracted the disease, but It is sup
posed he associated with some ol th,- men
from the Thlrty-Hrst who were infer!.-.!.
There has been no smallpox In the South
Dakota regiment since early in the cam
paign at Manila, and the officers of the
regiment are sure he did not bring the
disease with him from across the oc< an.
If it did come with the regiment there
may be more cases In the command.
Word baa been received from the Thir
ty-first Regiment, in quarantine at Angel
Island, that another o! the suspecta
developed into a case of smallpox, making
(ivÂ© in itll at the island; and there are

Two more transports got away yester
day. The Centennial with a Load of horses
went into the stream Tuesday night and
anchored. At 8 a. m. yesterday she sailed
for Honolulu. The Centennial will not
go to Manila this trip, but will land her
freight at Honolulu and come back here
tor another load, t >n her return to the
islands she will take aboard the horses
left on the first trip, her second cargo be
ing left at Honolulu to rest and get ac
climated.
The Sikh left for Portland two hours
after the Centennial. She will take on
troops for Manila, and as the men are
now on the Columbia River the transport
will get quick dispatch. Among those
who went away yesterday on the Sikh
i was Lieutenant S. M. English of the
j Thirty-fifth Infantry. He was formerly
an officer Of the Eighth California, but
received lus commission to the Thirty
fifth Regiment a few days ago. He is a
Bon of William D. English, secretary of
the Harl'or Commission. A host of friends
were down to see him off and wish him
a safe return.
Half a dozen boilermakers are at work
on the transport Glenogle and the chances
are that another gang will go to work
on the Valencia to-day. The men say
that all they ask is an eight-hour day
on Government work, and tnat they will
get it. They hayÂ«- do d< sire to drive trade
away from the port, and are confident
thafthey will not do so. The bosses are
afraid that if an eight-hour day is granted
on Government work the demand will
, then extend to the shops. This, the boil
ermakers say, Is not a fact, and they
are willing to bind themselves not to
make any demand In that direction for
six months.
At present the Mariposa is the only
outside Job over which there is any trou
ble. The Kisilon Iron Works has the con
tract, and one of the steamer's furnaces
| has been removed to the shop. The boiler
makers say that they will have to be em
â  i to "put it buck again, but the con
tractors assert that they can do the work
themselves. Both Bides are firm at pres
ent, but there seems to be an undercur
rent setting in the direction of an arnic
aâ  ttlement.
The Leeianaw went on the drydock yes
terday. She was ashore at Montara while
trying to make port in the fog and came
in" here leaking. An examination showed
that she was much more seriously dam
aged than was at first anticipated. Tnere
several big dents on the port side, a
couple of plates are cracked, a btrn>' num
ber of rivets are gone and several holes
wen punched In ncr bilge. As soon as
the extent of the damage was seen it
was decided to at once take her of! thÂ«>
drydock in order to make room lor the
Duguesclin. The latter vessel had the
right of way, but the owners of the Lee
lauaw paid so much a day fur the privi
lege of docking nrst. It will take several
u.eks to repair the Leeianaw and the
luiguesclin will have to wan her turn.
The holes in her were temporarily plugged

The cruiser Marblehead went to the
navy yard yesterday and the battleship
Lowa goes to sea to-day. She will prob
ably be back in port again Saturday, as
she" is only going out for target practice.
The Tahiti mail boat Tropic Bird
docked at the sea wall yesterday. Cap
tain Jackson says that during the entire
round trip it never blew stronger than a
decent breeze and the sea was like glass
nearly all the way. Mrs. d'Ancona. wife
of Dr. Arnold A. d'Ancona, waa a passen
ger for the round trip. Sh- made the voy
age for her health and bad a most de
lightful time. She Is In love With Tahiti
and thinks it rivals the paradise of the
Pacific. The Tropic Bird is another ves
sel that suffered through the lightship
not being in position. S).'- had been -I 1")
miles oft shore since the LOth inst. and
when Captain Jackson did make the place
where the lightship should have been he
did not know what to think. Luckily a
pilot-boat came along and one of the pi- !
lots brought him in.
The British ship Port Patrick arrived
from Newcastle, N. S. W.. and the Castle
Rock from Swansea yesterday, both coal
laden. During the last twenty-four hours
nearly 21.000 tons of coal came in through
the Golden Gate, ruid of this only 9600 tons
came from Puget Sound ports. The re
mainder was from <" a rdiff, Swansea and

The Port Patrick had some heavy
weather during the first part of the voy
age. A succession of heavy gales, with a
high, confused S'-a. did considerable dam

had their legs and arms broken and were
bruised about the body. They will be sent :
to the Marine Hospital.

â * â¢* ship Commander Hawley has been in charge of the Bureau of Navl
' gatlon at Wnshlnpton for the last Hire? years, and owing to the close rela
â  tlonshlp Into which he has been brought with tho enlisted men of the navy
> he was glvn chart."- of th<- Hartford and Intrusted with the difficult task
â  of making shel ' of about 300 land lubbers between the ages of 18
1 and 2. r . years This Idea of a naval training ship Is something entirely new.
â  and ow^ Us origin to the suggestion and unremitting work of Commander
1 Hawley. who hns long been a strong advocate of such an institution for mak
' ir.p American sailors for an American navy.
' When seen yesterday Commander Hawley said: "Yes, I am out here to
' take charge of the old Hartford, and expect to leave about the first week
! In November for a cruise to Hampton Roads. Whether we will go around
â¢ the Horn or westward via China remains yet to be determined. The. Hart
â  for.l is now at the yard, but will go into commission about the 2d of next
' month, and In about five weeks from that time will start on her long trip to
| tho- waters of tho Atlantic.
"We will take about 800 boys with us. and before we get to our Journey's
â¢ end we expect to have 300 tlrst-class seamen to turn over to the Government.
Most of these men come from St. Paul, St. Ix)Uis, Chicago, Cleveland and
Cincinnati. They an- of the best stock In the country. They are youngâ
the Government will only aocept men between the ages of 18 and 25â of good
character and they are all American born. There Is no reason In the world
why they should not turn out to be an honor to the country whose battles
they may be called upon to fight. Most of them have been receiving instruc
tion at the yard for some time past and consequently will not go to sea en
tirely Ignorant of the duties they will b*Â» made to perform.
"This idea of a training ship Is something new. The Government has had
apprentice boys for many years, but this Is the first time it has devoted a
vessel to the work of making sailors out of grown men.
"The Idea that the American navy is full of foreigners is a mistake. The
percentage of Amerlcnn-born men now in the service Is about R7, and this
will be rapidly Increased under the present system until the whole service will
contain nothing but Yankees. We. want all the good men we can get. The
Eastern coast is about worked out for the present and we want to get a fey
men from the West. Th<> quota of enlisted men allowed by Uncle Sam is still
about 1700 short, and I see no reason why it cannot be made complete with
the young blood from this end of the world."
The Hartford is the same vessel which won such glory as the flagship of
Admiral Fnrragut. Her upper works are all new. but her hull is of stout
]iv*Â»oak and is the same hull that plowed the. shot-churned waters of Mobile
Hay. She has been out of commission slnco 1887, and this will be the first
long cruise she has made for many a long year.
Commander Hawley has a distinguished record. He was executive officer
nt the Nipsic during the Samoan hurricane, and received the thanks of Con
gress for the gallantry he then displayed, He commanded the Detroit on
the Asiatic station in 1896. and from there went to take charge of the Wash
ington Bureau of Navigation, from which post hÂ© has been relieved and or
dered to his present command.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1899.
MAUSER BULLET LIES
DEEP IN HIS BRAIN
j T T Is seldom a bullet plows nearly through a man's brain and leaves him
I life enough to complain about It. but that is what happened to John Gret-
I zer, of the First Nebraska "Volunteers, who Is now at his home enjoying
â¢ x herxlth ar,d strength with a steel-Jacketed Mauser comfortably resting ln
âº side his skull. It Is one of the most interesting cases the war has provided
c for the edification of the army surgeons and when the forthcoming medical
history of the war Is published, Gretzer and his bullet will be found the
' chapter of greatest Importance. The man was shot In the forehead in one
I of the battles of the Filipino Insurrection last March: the bullet entered his
, brain and remained there and after being unconscious for a little over a day
f and spending four weeks of ease in the hospital. Gretzer joined his command
, and served the remainder of the time his regiment was at the front.
Gretzer returned to this city when his regiment came home to be
â  mustered out. He was feeling no evil effects from the forr-lgn substance in
, his brain, but he was worried over Its presence for he knew it was in there
and he feared the consequences. He had no idea where it was and he was
anxious to find out, so while his regiment was waiting to be discharged he
! called upon Colonel Forwood, the chief surgeon of this department, and
i asked his advice.
; Colonel Forwood told him the only thing for him to do was to have an
X-ray photograph of his head taken, and he save Gretzer the address of
Miss Fleischman. of this city. Gretzer went to her and the result was an
! other interesting thing in surgeryâ the finest X-ray photograph of a skull
; that has ever been taken. The sides of the skull are so thick and the
texture of the skull so dense that it has heretofore baffled the skill of the
! radiograph experts and there has been no picture extant of a foreign body
â¢ Inside the skull: but the picture of Oretzer's head was a triumph In more
, ways than one, for it not only 1b a marvelous specimen of the work and value
of X-ray photography, but it gave Gretzer all the information he was look
ing for. It showed the skull perfectly and near the back of the bead, about
! an inch ami a half or two inches from the skull. Is the shadow of the
! Mauser. There is no mistaking it.
The bullet has not been distorted in the least, and it shows clear and
; plain almost in the middle of the brain. It has been turned down a little In
' its passage through the tissues, and the point of the bullet Is directed toward
â¢ the back of the neck, but it lies in plain sight in the photograph, and there
; can be no doubt of its presence.
' Having been so successful with the photograph from the side. Miss
Fletechman tried one from in front, but the patient was restless and ncr
! vnus, and she did not expose the plate long enough to secure a good shadow,
i but the print of the bullet can be discerned deep in the brain and Just a llt
; tie below the level of the left eye.
The history of the case is a most wonderful one, even from a standpoint
: not mfedical. When Gretzer was shot he dropped insensible instantly. He
was still Insensible when he was taken to the hospital, and it was supposed
he would not recover, but after a little more than twenty-four hours he gave
. slkup of returning consciousness, and before long he was awake again and
on the road to recovery. At first there was a slight paralysis of the right
side. It is well known to tho medical profession that an Injury to the left side
t of the brain will show Its effect on the right side of the body, and vice vena,
â  except In the organs of the head. It caused no surprise, therefore, when the
, paralysis appeared on the right side, nor when the sense of taste In the left
.-^iile of the mouth was lost. The wound healed rapidly and without complica
tions, and besides the paralysis and the loss of taste there were no other
â  symptoms traceable to the Imbedded bullet. The bullet entered the forehead
. about an inch over the inside of the left eye, and for a time it was believed
the eye was affected, but as it grew better immediately and after a few days
gave no further signs of weakness, the trouble was charged to the shock of
; the striking: mlssiie and not to the result of Its presence inside the skull.
; Thc-o was then no effect on the man's mental powers or upon his speech,
. and although the surgeons here watched closely for any effect upon his
memory or his mind or upon any of his senses, they have had only their
wonder for their pains, for the man is suffering in no way from his
souvenir of the war.
Within a month the paralysis that affected Gretzer's right side had dis
, appeared,' and the only remaining reminder was the dulled sense of taste,
for even that was growing better, and by the time he loft here for his home
his taste was again normal. He was wounded in March; before the middle
1 of May he was again on duty with his regiment.
There is no way of getting at the bullet except by an operation which
would in all probability prove fatal, but there is no necessity for getting
at it. It is being taken care of by nature. By this time there has been
formed around it a little membranous sac or "cyst." and in this it will prob
: ably lie until the man dies from some other cause. I'nless an abscess forms
. within this cyst there can be no trouble, and if an abscess was one of the
| results of the wound, it would nave appeared before now. Of the wound
itself there is scarcely a trace.
About the time Gretzer reported to Colonel Forwood, there was on this
; coast a Dr. Parkhill of Denver, a noted specialist of the brain, and Colonel
Forwood called him in consultation as to the location of the bullet. From his
; examinations of the man, the information he received of the wound and its
results, and particularly from the radiographs, he came to the same eon
: elusion that had been reached by Colonel Forwood and his surgeons. Ac
, cording to them all the bullet lies just at the bottom of the left lobe of the
â  cerebrum or large brain, and resting on the "tenorium," the membrane that
' separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum, or small brain. Had the bullet
! entered the small brain it would probably have proved fatal, but even as
â¢ it was, it was never supposed the man would survive.
; Gretzer was at the hospital most of the time he was out here, not as a
patient, but consulting with the surgeons; for the man was much worried
over the presence of the bullet. He was assured there was a probability
' that there would be no more danger, but to make sure he was given a let
; ter to a noted surgeon near his home, and at the first sign of trouble he
will go to this man to be operated upon. In the meantime the surgeon has
I been given a full history of the case and has been furnished with copies
of the radiographs. The symptoms the surgeons fear most are convulsions
and epileptic tits, for to them the most wonderful thing about the case,
next to the man's complete recovery. Is the fact that he has shown no signs
of convulsions or epilepsy even from the tirst. The man is well; if it were
not for the little leaden pellet In his brain he would be as if no Filipino
bullet had ever marked him for Us own.
The radiographs are the property of the Government. As soon as she
found how far the results of her experiments had exceeded her expectations
Miss Fleischman took the plates to Colonel Forwood. He declared he
would buy them, and he telegraphed to Washington to the surgeon general
for permission, giving an outline of the case. The answer was prompt. Col
onel Forwood bought the plates and they will bo the best part of the medi
cal history of the war.

BIDDERS FIGHT
OVER CHARGES!
Criticise Ferry Slip
Specifications.
PROTEST AGAINST CHANGES
FAVORITISM CHARGED AND
FLATLY DENIED.
Chief Engineer Holmes Declares That
the Kickers Have Only Them
selves to Blame for Losing
the Contract.
The unsuccessful bidders for the con
| tract for the construction of the new
ferry slips at Main street, which are to be
| used by the Santa Fe, are making a
j strong fight against the proposed changes
in the specifications, which they claim
will materially benefit the successful bid
der, the City Street Improvement Com
pany. They also hint that the latter firm
â  knew before putting in its bid that the
changes referred to would be made, and
was therefore In a position to underbid
its competitors. Chief Engineer Holmes i
: emphatically denies that any favors were !
j or are being shown, but he declares that
1 all the contractors knew before they sub
: mltted their bids that the desirability of
i substituting wooden stave cylinders for
! the steel cylinders called for in the speci-
I fications was under consideration. The
: matter came up before the Harbor Com
; missioners at the regular meeting of the
| board yesterday afternoon, when Secre-
I tary English read a letter from the ag- |
grieved contractors, of even date, voicing
' their protest. The letter is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of State Har
bor Commissionersâ Gentlemen: We, the
undersigned, having learned that your hon
i orable buard Is about to Rive considera
tion to some changes in the plans for the
construction of the ferry slips at Main
' street, on which we recently tendered you bids,
i do mest respectfully protest against same, be
! Ueving that at this time before any of the
I work Is executed. It is giving a decidedly un
j Just advantage to those jiersons who were In-
I vlted en the second bidding to complete for this
1 work. If either of the undersigned had been
| aware that they could succeed in having nd
vantagaous arrangements' made after the con
! tract was awarded tr> them, there is very llt -
' tie reasdn to doubt that their bids would be
. very materially reduced, but on the contrary.
I all of us bid en the supposition that the usual
I custom of your engineering department would
| be adhered to In this case, viz.: "'A rl^id de
< mand for a strict compliance with the specl
! flcatlons In every Dartleular," and believing
| that to be the case we were obliged to base |
; our estimates accordingly. And again we re- |
peat, that the changes that are now r^com
tnended to be made will be a rery derided ad
vantage to the persons to whin the contract
i was awarded and a great injustice to all other
i competitors who bid on the work, believing
I as above stated, that they would be oblig-d tv
I comply strictly with the specifications; there
j fore, we earnestly solicit your honorable board
Ito adhere to the original specifications and
i make no changes at this time, unless it becomes
! clearly evident the changes would be necessary
i to make the work more perfect in some particu
lar than the specifications outlined, very re
spectfully yours.

Previous to the reading of this letter, ,
I however, the secretary read the following i
1 letter from the chief engineer, in which I
the proposed changes are recommended, ;
1 written a week ago:
j To the Honorahl" Board of Harhnr Commis
sioners â Gentlemen: In the matter of the pro
posal of the city Street Improvement Com
' pany icontiiutors for building the freight slip
i for the Santa Fe Terminal Company) to allow
the Harbor Commissioners a rebat" of $12"<i if
wooden stave cylinders are substituted for the
i steel cylinders mentioned in the specifications
' nnd which was referred to me, I desire to re- j
j port as follows:
' Just before the receipt of the second pr<>
posala for this ferry slip I sent to each of the
original bidders an amended specification, ask
ing for bids on the aforesaid wooden cylinders
'â  in lieu of the steel ones, and on the advice of
the attorney of the board the same was with
drawn for legal reasons. This I mention for
the reason that I desire to call the board's at
tention to the fact that all parties bidding on
: this work were aware that when tho same was j
: finally awarded, the successful hldder would |
â  be asked lor a proposition on the above-men- i
: tloned wooden cylinders.
I think the allowance proposed by the City I
Street Improvement Company is r reasonable j
; one, and that the change is for the better. I,
i therefore, recommend Its acceptance by the
! board. Respectfully submitted.
HOWARD C. HOLMES, Chief Engineer.
Mr. Dundon and Mr. Healy were
i present and addressed the board, but their
remarks were simply a reiteration of the
protest.
Chief Engineer Holmes said the chang- i
Ing of the specifications was not without |
precedent and cited the case of a ferry ;
j slip. Healy, Tibbetts & Co., one of the

wherein the specifications were changed
' after the letting of the contract.
"\V. E. Dennison of the City Street Im
i provement Company said his firm had i
i been furnished no exclusive information. I
"We offered to make the change at Mr.
i Holmes' suggestion." said he. "and al- j
low a rebate of $1200. It is immaterial to !
us whether or not the board accepts this |

f erred to the attorney for the board and
an informal meeting of the Commission
ers will be held this afternoon to receive j
bis report.
The first set of bids for the construction i
i of the ferry slip was rejected because |
! they were considered too high, the lowest j
; being over $33,000. The second timo the
bids were opened k was found that the I
original bidders, including those whose |
signatures are appended to the protest, i
had raised instead of lowered their i
figures, the Dundon Bridge and Construe- i
I tion Company, whose bid was next to the |
! one submitted by the City Street Improve- i
ment Company, offering to do the work i
for something over $34,000. The contract '
was awarded to the City Street Improve- |
: ment Company at $30,400. As the. cost of
J steel cylinders is estimated at about $2700
1 and the board is saved $1200 by the sub
stitution of wooden stave cylinders, Chief
1 Engineer Holmes says he cannot see
where the bids of the protestants could be
pared enough to make any material dif
ference in the award of the contract.

DEATH OF MRS. BROWN
Mrs. Susanna Brown, the well-to-do
widow of Richard Brown, pioneer and
capitalist, died suddenly yesterday in her
rooms at 1524 Sutler street. The case was
reported to Coroner Hill, who found on
investigation that Dr. Carney had been
attending Mrs. Brown for several years and
treated her for the ailment that finally
carried her away.
She had risen at the usual hour and
before she had fully dressed was seized
with an apoplectic stroke and fell to the
floor. Her housekeeper and the maid at-
I tempted to administer the usual remedies,
but she was dead before they had reached
| her.
i The deceased lady was born in England
78 years ago. Her husband was a wealthy
pioneer and died several years ago.

Insane streak in his cell at the City Prison
yesterday morning by tearing off his
clothes and shouting. He was sent to the
insane ward in the Receiving Hospital
and will be examined by the Insanity
Commissioners this morning.

OUR HOME STUDIES
OUR series of articles designed for home study,
an outline of which was given in The Call
yesterday, are in line with the highest ten
dencies of recent journalism. "News" has been de
nned as "a current event of general interest." The
definition is hardly accurate. Whatsoever is of in
terest to any one is news to that person when the
information is first given, whether the event be cur
rent or a century old. The American mind has been
cultivated to such a degree that it is more or less in
terred in the whole domain of knowledge, and reads
with attention the records of the past as well as the
events of the day.
In undertaking to supply the public with a course
of study covering the works of Shakespeare, the
achievements of renowned artists, the policies of the
great statesmen of our country', the science and the
art of domestic economy, and the education of boys
and girls in many lines of useful endeavor, The Gall
does not step beyond the legitimate fields of com
prehensive journalism. It is but another effort to fur
nish the reading public with the information it de
sires, to give what to many persons will be new- c< in
cerning matters that are of perennial interest to in
telligent men and women.
An undertaking of this kind is one which will com
mend itself to the public. It has been said the daily
reading of a well-conducted newspaper furnishes a
liberal education. The saying is something of an ex
aggeration, and yet as journalism progresses and ex
pands along legitimate lines it tends to become more
and more a liberal educating influence in the com
munity. There was a time when the newspaper was
no more than a partisan political sheet. With the
invention of the telegraph the gathering of news be
catne of more importance than the championship of
political parties, and the press rapidly developed into
the magnificent and far-reaching newsgathering
agencies, which now furnish their readers with daily
information from all parts of the globe. Still later
the Sunday supplement came in to provide a maga
zine for the masses containing a vast variety of in
formation, stories, poems and general miscellany, for
the entertainment of the people on the day of rest.
Each step in this development has had an educa
tional value, but education has not been the prime
object of the step. Now the time has come when the
increasing culture of the people demands something,
like a systematic review of great subjects. Thou^
sands of earnest readers desire to pursue a course of
reading on some question of large importance under
the direction of men of wide learning and of known
ability to teach. To that desire The Call responds.
Our series of home studies will be interesting as
matters of leisure reading to all, whether they desire
to prosecute any particular study or not, but to those
who wish to profit something by their reading and to
make themselves masters of a certain phase of litera
ture, history, art or science, they will be of the high
est value. The articles might be defined as short
studies on great subiecti by men who understand
them, and a careful reading of any of them will repay
the attention of all by something at least of instruc
tion as we!! as of entertainment.
Ker British Majesty's Government has now declared
ominously that in all further discussion of the Trans
vaal situation Britain will formulate it? own proposals
â¢'ement. The same Government did the same
thing before and should have learned by this time that
a proposition is not by any means a disposition of a
quarrel. The Boer? know how to shoot.
The Mayor of New York has been seriously dis
turbed at a fear that he would lose to Governor
Roosevelt th? honor of being the first welcoming
American to shake hands with Admiral Dewey. The
early coming of the Admiral made unnecessary a
function that would have given to him no particular
distinction.
The Mexican Government, so the vivacious cor
respondents report, intends to send some "natural
Lorn mountain lighters" after the Yaquis. A few
; ' Indian fighters might be made a judicious ad
dition to the crowd.
1' is sometimes said that it is as hard as pulling
teeth to get money out of some people. The scandal
in the State Board of Dental Examiners is a very fair
indication that some people who want to pull teeth
have the money.
If a marital knot many times tied will prevent the
bond from breaking the granddaughter of General
Grant and Prince Cantacuzene ought to be well im;r
i:cd.
SAX FRANCISCO has the best right of any American seaport to give expression
of welcome to Admiral Dewey.
We all remember the first days of the Spanish war. West Indian waters
were crowded with Spanish merchant ships, carrying valuable cargoes, and the bulletin
writers in front of the newspaper. offices in the press triangle on Market street could hardly
use the brush fast enough to keep up with the wired reports of the capture of these ships
of the enemy. While the crowd cheered itself hoarse and husky every merchant that read
the bulletins knew what it all meant to men of their guild engaged in Spanish commerce.
With their argosies captured and their cargoes the spoil of war, years of careful enter
prise went for naught and the Moloch of war invoked by their erring Government was
eating up the substance that represented the toil of a lifetime. But Spain had fleets at
sea. The register of her navy showed it superior to ours in ships, speed, guns and ca
pacity. Our merchants knew that unless some factor appeared, till then unknown, the
chances at -ea were against us, and that for every Spanish merchantman stopped by a
shot arid run into an American port with a prize crew on board one or many American
ships might fall captive to the enemy, and the misfortunes that fell so thick and fast
upon Spanish trade might be more than duplicated in the destruction of ours. This port
ami its deep water commerce were peculiarly exposed. Gold ships were sailing toward us
with the spoils of Alaskan mines. Fur ships from Bering Sea and cotnmerce with hither
and farther India, China, Australia and Siberia would be abroad upon the waters, bear
ing the fortunes and freighted with the solvency of banks and business houses. In the
Mint and Sub-Treasury coin was piled up counting a hundred millions, and offering to
martial enterprise a richer spoil than Persian, Greek or Roman conqueror ever added to
his war chest. Our harbor defenses were untried, and when the Oregon was ordered to
the Atlantic station it was demanded that our members of Congress protest against her de
parture, for it left us feeling defenseless and abandoned by our own Government.
But our defence was not in our hills that look upon the sea. It was below our
horizon in waters strange to our people, breaking upon a coast that few American feet
had trod. It was in the American squadron on the Asiatic coast. The names of its offi
cers were not familiar to us. The commodore whose pennon streamed above its flagship
had passed years in the orderly change from land to sea duty, like his brother officers; had
marked time in the line of promotion with the rest and when it came, tardily, had taken
it in the matter of course routine of the department. The Government could not know
certainly that he had the quality which makes a man wait a lifetime in the service, ready
to rise to an emergency when it comes, or ready to close his eyes on sea and shore and!
die with his trained capacity untried and passing with him. But Dewey, trained in a hard
and homely school, which gave Ethan Allen to history in the Revolution and the Ran
soms in our later wars, and to their country's statesmanship and jurisprudence Brad
ley, Solomon Foote, Phelps and their peers, had shown himself ready for great deeds by
the self-command and preparation which make them possible, and on that ist of May, that
is to stand forever foremost among the days accented by the high action of men, he be
somed our enemy from the sea and made the ocean irom continent to continent as peace
ful as a summer lake. Thence on our merchantmen spread their sails as safely as a song
bird her wings, and our great commercial exchanges with far countries went on without
a thrill of fear. The sad misfortunes of war rested on the trade of our enemy alone.
Dewey had signaled our merchant flag, "All's well." from the bridge of his ship and every !
wheel turned again and every sail unfurled. The vast treasure in our vaults was safe as a]
lady's pocket money in her purse.
The superiority of the Spanish navy was shown to be on the register only, and not
upon the sea. The men he fought were the bravest of the brave. We salute them now
as he did then, but they had met their master and they fell.
The people inland may not appreciate all that the victory of Manila Bay meant to
us, but we appreciate all that it meant to our non-maritime States. This country's coasts j
and seaports are its commercial skin, and as no animal body can live without a skin, when
the national pores are dosed and the national skin under the guns of an enemy ceases its
function of exuding the commerce generated in the nation's body the nation dies. Our
ports are our pores and Dewey kept them open.
It is for this that his footfall on the Atlantic coast jars a continent into jubilee and
lights the sensibilities of San Francisco like a myriad of globes flashing as the stars.
Like Lincoln, Grant and other Americans whose names will never fade that have
been known of men in this generation, Dewey recurs to the simple ways of his early life,
and always in such a way as to tutor his young countrymen for the future responsibilities
which are to be theirs.
Explaining his arrival in Xew York ahead of time, he said: "It has been my custom
to be a day ahead rather than an hour behind time." No more need be said in revelation
of his character and the reason for his achievement. When a boy in Vermont, a subaltern i
officer, a fleet captain and a commodore, observance of that rule kept him at the point
where great things might be, and ready to do them bravely and well.
He closes the chapter that tells of the world's sea fights which opens with Salamis.
This century will add no line to it, and its accumulating luster gathered in the centuries
that lie between seems but the luminous tablet inscribed with the greater light in which
is written what he did.
San Francisco feels it all. As a commercial city she salutes Dewey as her deliverer
from peril. As a seaport she hails him as one that made the ocean safe to commerce. As
an American city she brings her patriotic gratitude to gild the fame of her country's great
est soldier of the seas.
ENGLAND AND THE BOERS
A FEW days ago it was said in England that the
time has come to end duality in South Africa.
This means that England proposes to tolerate
|no government but her own in South Africa. Her
policy is far-sighted. The Transvaal Republic occu
pies the peculiar position of being an independent
Government without being a member of the family of
nations. It has no international existence, no ex
ternal contacts and is not represented anywhere
abroad by Ministers or Consuls. In their anxiety for
independence at home, for sole control of the land
they had conquested from the wilderness, and for the
right to make their own laws and generate civil au
thority among themselves and for themselves, the
Boers surrendered to England's demand that she have
control of their international interests.
Now England has confused the world's judgment
as to the scope of her authority and makes demands
on the Transvaal that, granted, will destroy the do
mestic independence and self-government to secure
which the Boers gave up their right to a place in the
family of nations.
England claims the right to dictate the terms of the
franchise iv the Boer republic, and goes further by
requiring that English shall be adopted as the lan
guage used in the Volksraad! To submit to these de
mands.is to abolish the republic. The Boers speak
Dutch, not English. To make the use of the latter
tongue obligatory in the Volksraad is to make them
ineligible to seats in their own Parliament, and to
admit Engli-h subjects to the franchise without giv
ing up their allegiance to Great Britain is a thing ~.0
fantastic as to be insufferable.
But England calls it merely a means "for securing
such substantial and immediate representation for the
Uitlander? as will enable them to secure for them
selves that fair and just treatment which was formally
promised them in 1881." No such means to that end
were promised in iBBt, or at any other time. The
Uitlanders were promised nothing more than such
administration of the laws of the republic as would
prevent the denial of justice. To say that this meant
their retention of allegiance to Great Britain while
voting in the republic, and forcing the language of the
people out of their own Parliament, is to make a
demand to which the Boers cannot submit until they
are conquered by arms. They are a small and weak
commonwealth, in a far country, but they are the
people of William the Silent, and they are better
dead in battle, surviving themselves in a memory that
will in all the future inspire others to stand for their
honor and fight for their rights, than living in the

DEWEY WELCOME HOME.
baseness and cowardice of peaceful surrender to such
arrogant assertion of power.
No wonder that all thoughtful Englishmen oppose
these unjustifiable and intolerable demands of their
Government. They know that throughout the ages
power grown so great that it forgets justice has been
crushed by persistent aggression against the weak,
and so they tremble for the empire. The Boers may
be crushed, but in their fate the other victims of im
perial rule may be nerved to concert of purpose, and
the empire, smitten all along its far-stretched battle
line, may get a mortal wound.
Thfc London mob is bellowing for war. The mob
always does, in all countries. But nations are not
built on their rabble, nor maintained by the unthink
ing.
Pretending to ask justice for the Uitlanders, Eng
land's terms are subversive of justice to the Boers
themselves. Her real purpose is to end duality in
South Africa.
Why is duality they any worse than duality on this
continent, which we share with her? We live at
peace with her flag floating over the Dominion 01
Canada, and we deny and defy her right to dictate
our laws of naturalization and expatriation. Her
subjects retain their allegiance and sojourn among us,
without the franchise which we cannot compel them
to accept, and whose conditions she cannot compel
us to change. If what she demands in South Africa
is right there it would be right everywhere. Let her
j assert it against us, and see what would happen.
The Missouri physician who claims to have dis-
I covered a means of curing insanity by injecting
j goat lymph into the patient deserves credit for
originality of thought if for nothing else. His sys
tem, moreover, opens up glittering possibilities. If
an erratic crank can be brought to sanity by the
lymph of a goat why may we not expect to see the
dullness of idiocy made lively by an injection of
I monkey lymph?

tify as much as the American people have
undertaken to do in the last year and a
half. It is a painful Illustration of the
Indian's just conclusion when he said,
"White man is mighty uncertain." Even
the Indian would hardly have supposed
that this great and free Government could
have been guilty of such palpable and in
excusable inconsistency. We entered
upon che war with Spain prefaced by the
solemn declaration that it was in the in
terest of civilization and law, and to pre
vent that country from exercising its
jurisdiction over distant people without
their consent, and with the broad and
open declaration to the world that upon
our part the war was without the motive
or the intention or desire to acquire any
supremacy or emoluments. And yet we
are conducting this same war with a
bloody war for jurisdiction over these
same people we sought, to liberate in order
to establsh our military authority over
them by military force and without their
consent. And all this for doubtful gain
aaid questionable expediency, and in sub
version of the first cardinal and funda
mental principles of our Government.
This is what our President very aptiy
called "criminal aggression," and so the
world knows it and so it is; and the pity
is if we are going to carry out such a
policy that we made so many humiliat
ing and false pretenses.
To my mind the most alarming result
from this war is the necessity of a great
standing army. Our position doubtless
requires, or at least justifies, a first-class
navy, but so long as we remain in the
Western. Hemisphere (in other words, at
home), it is perfectly clear that our in
telligent citizen soldiers could be mar
shaled, equipped and at the front ready
to bring defeat, as they have always done,
to any attempted foreign invasion; but If
we are to continue our jurisdiction over
remote countries we must be ready in the
event of an insurrection there to repress
it with an army trained and ready for the
purpose. In the event of a war with a
great foreign power, which we could meet
and defeat at home with our citizen sol
diers, we must have as well organized and
as large a standing army as the country
with which we are to go to war. otherwise
our dependencies will be wrested from us.
To maintain such an army will cost ten
times more than our colonies are worth.
A great military establishment and a
great standing army has never been main
tained for any length of time in a repub
lic without the destruction of the n pub
llc. That such a result could follow in
this country and that we could maintain
an unr publican form of government
with a great standing army and yet pre
serve republic-tin institutions, is a fallacy
hardly needing refutation, and a large
standing army must be maintained if we
pursue this policy of foreign territorial
acquisition and aggression.
The humiliating way in which public
sentiment may be perverted and become
accustomed to unusual ami Inconsistent
conditions and suggestions is very
forcibly Illustrated by what is appar
ently proposed to be done with a
certain royal gentleman called the
Sultan of Sulu. who holds jurisdiction
over the Sulu group of islands adjacent
to the Philippines. We have sent an Em
>assador or Minister who might properly
>c styled nn envoy extraordinary- (for he
is certainly extraordinary in his position)
to negotiate a treaty with this royal
freak for the purpose of having him
recognize the suzerainty of the united
States. From a democratic point of
view I rather like the- idea of a suzer
ainty of a republican government over
a royal subject. It Is such a sublime and
perfect somersault of the law of nature
and nations that it is refreshing to he
hold, in other words, we as a demo
cratic people cannot recognize the dtvtne
right of kings nor have one of our own;
that is, not to rule over us, but appar
ently we .-an have one over whom we
may have tho amusement of ruling. A
king cannot rule over us, but we can rule
over him and his subjects, being at the
same time his subjects and our own. We
all. and especially our yellow journals,
have been for months .spluttering and
fuming like a yellow-stone paint pot over
the horrible fact that one Mr. Roberts of
i'tnh. who has been BeaJed to three or
four alleged lawful wives, Is going to sit
in Congress. It is stated with great fer
vor and unction that this ought not to he
allowed (and I am disposed io think
rightly i. The programme; however, as
agreed by our envoy extraordinary to the
Sultan of Sulu, is solemnly announced to
1 c tli.it he is to recognize our sovereignty,
and that thereafter wo are to have juris
diction over his kingship and his Sub
jects. He is, nevertheless, to carry on
and retain his old Job of governing, under
our jurisdiction, and we are to pay him
$10,000 a year, which, of course, is a very
unnecessary amount for a tropical
sovereign if he did not have to support a
harem of a score of wives, more or less,
but if we arc going to have a king and a
hiiem we must pay the expenses of
both. The two points most difficult to
agree upon were first, whether this shock
headed, spider-legged down among kings
and king among clowns would allow the
slaves of his dominion (and therefore
ours) to buy their liberty at the market
price and would carry the American flag,
ami it was especially desired that
the American Hag should be carried, and
it seems to me that the point is a very
good ope. It is certainly important to
know whether or not the American flag
is to spread its folds over a king ana
over a harem and over a slave market,
"where a slave may buy his liberty at
the market price." It is the "flag of the
free and the brave," and ours is "a land
without a serf, a servant or a slave."
That is, we have so said and so assumed.
The Question is: Is it true-; if so. Is it to
continue to be true? It may be com
pensation sufficient in some minds that
we are expanding over more territory,
more- people and more wealth. But un
less we are a degenerate and forgetful
people there ought to be no adequate
consideration for such an exchange. A
country cannot be "half slave and half
free." This cannot be a land of free men
and of subjects, a land of homes and
harems, and over all these there cannot
float one flag, nt least as we know it and
love it. Although it may never be ac
complished.-the suggestion ought to turn
the face of every true American away
from this unholy, undemocratic and un-
American enterprise.
I notice that great force is placed upon
the fact that Spain for "00 years had ruled
the Philippines, that her jurisdiction was
undoubted and continuous. That it was
rightful or with tho consent of the gov
erned, however, is not pretended. This
continued and undisputed jurisdiction and
sovereignty of 300 years over the Philip
pine Islands and the nine million inhabit
ants thereof we bought and paid therefor
twenty million dollars. Therefore it is
our own. It can be proven by every ut
terance ever made upon the subject by
any American that sovereignty assumed
by military force carried out and perpet
uated without the consent of the gov
erned is absolutely a fundamental wrong.
It creates and carries with It no
right and no authority that can be
bought or sold or exercised. Never
theless, with an inconsistency inde-
Bcrjbable, while we ourselves have most
openly and publicly and continuously pro
claim that it was an iniquity and a shame
and a wrong, and without rlKht; we have
bought this iniquity and wrong for
$20,000,000, solemnly and with great
monarchical assumption of the di
vine right of somebody to rule
j somebody else, we have assured our
i selves and the world that we have
a most perfect, . legai find undisputed
; and moral title to the Philippines. Ev.-ry
-1 body knows and everybody has said that
Spain had no right to the Philippines-
I that, she had ruled them by the force of
I arms wrongfully, unjustly and without
any right or authority whatever. It is
! fundamental In law and In common sÂ»nse
I that a person or a country who purchases
a wrong exercised without right
acquires nothing. It is by this
rule, of which we have been
the chief opponent in the world, that
! we have no more right because we bought
; Spain's wrong, ourselves to rule the Phil
-1 ipplnes, than we would have to go and
subjugate tne inhabitants of Norway or
Sweden, or Switzerland or France and
this is so obvious and so well sustained
by our own principles and our own argu
ments and our own declarations that it 'S
a wonder that it was ever promulgated
The argument nowadays most in
dulged in is tho old argument of Intimida
tion, and while I have no patience With
the man who would wish to defeat or
destroy the armies of our country, the
use of the word "traitor" has been far
too genepilly and freely indulged in
Looking at the present war and the
uresent policy as un-American, it would
PART 11.
be easy for an anti-expansionist to say
that the expansionist was a traitor to
everything that was American or dear to
an American, but a traitor is a criminal,
and a man who proceeds howsoever iil-aa
visedly without the Intention to destroy
or defeat his country, but as he considers
for its best interest is never a
traitor. The most used 1 argument Oy
all expansionists is that by tne
agitation of the anti-expansion doc
trine at this time and the dis
sensions thereby created in this country,
the Philippines have been encouraged to
go to war, and have since been en
couraged to prosecute the same. It is
rather refreshing to have the people who
advocate a policy the price of which is
unhappy and unfortunate war place
all the* responsibility and blame upon
those who opposed the policy and would
have averted the war. It is claimed but
for the exercise of free speech, the protest
of citizens against their country adopting
a course that was considered unwjse, im
politic and un-American, the Philippines
would never have gone to war. Such a
result may be In a degree unfortunate,
if true, but that it would be a reason or
justification that the right of free speech
should be silenced and that American
citizens should not protest against their
country adopting a dangerous and ruinous
policy is a little too fax behind in the
history of tho world and too well deter
mined to the contrary to be now opan to
argument. We have a very good illus
tration of this argument and a most ex
cellent answer thereto in the proceeding's
before the British Parliament at the time
the war was brewing with the American
colonies, and It was claimed that those
who espoused the American cause and
who. led by Mr. Pitt, did not hesitate to
denounce the course of England, their
own country, and defended the course
of the insubordinate colonies, were trait
ors to England and giving aid, comfort
and encouragement to the Americans.
Mr. Pitt has been of all foreign states
men our Ideal, and if he is not by reason
of our imperialistic policy ana tendency,
to be set aside along with the Declaration
of Independence, the farewell address of
George Washington and the rights of
man, he is about as good authority as
could be quoted outside, possibly, of some
Americans qf the lirst rank. In reference
to the criticisms heaped upon himself and
those supporting his policy and defending
the position of the American colonies. Mr.
Pitt, in his great speech upon the subject
in the British Parliament, used this lan
guage: "Gentlemen, sir, have been
charged with giving birth to sedition in
America. They have spoken their senti
ment with freedom against this unhappy
act, and that freedom lias become their
crime. Sorry I am to hear the liberty
of speech In this house imputed as a
crime. But the imputation shall not dis
courage me. It is a liberty I mean to ex- I
ercise. No gentleman ought to be afraid ;
to exercise it. It is a liberty which the j
gentleman who calumniates it might have j
profited by; he might have desisted from j
his project. The gentleman tells us Amer
ica is obstinate. 1 rejoice that America has
resisted," together with further remarks
to the same effect. It would certainly
indicate that Mr. Pitt in his loyal advo
cacy of the rights of man as he saw
them was about as treasonable in his ar
raignment of his country's policy as the j
most radical expansionist of these days.
As Mr. Pitt remarked that the Imputa
tion made would not "discourage him, it
is probably quite as true in this country
that those who from love of a democratic
system of government oppose the advanc
ing policy of imperialism will not be dis
couraged from a Steadfast advocacy of
the policy they believe to be right, hav
ing a right to believe in their own minds
tiint if anybody could be guilty of trea
son it would be those who are subvert
ing republican government and demo
cratic principles to an unwarranted and
unjustifiable imposition of power upon a
foreign people, and who are more
nearly guilty of treason than any
others in this country. But for I
the reason above stated, the use I
uf the word is narrow minded and un- I
warranted. Those opposed to expansion !
have hern termed "traitors.'" "Tories,"
"Copperheads," "Aunties" and the like,
evidencing a disposition to reduce a legit
imate discussion to the level of a prize
rinÂ« riot and apparently without much
thought as to the use of the words. A j
Tory was an American who during the j
Revolution sympathized with and advo- i
cated tho riplu of England to continue I
its arbitrary rule over us without our
consent. So upon principle a Tory is an
expansionist, and the only Tory that
could exist in this war would be a Fili- |
pino who gave us aid and comfort in at- j
tempting to impose our rule on his coun- !
trymen. A Copperhead was one opposed
t.i freeing the slaves and contended
we had no right to continue to subject
them to Involuntary servitude. So upon
principle he agreed with the doctrine that
the consent of the governed is unneces
sary, so naturally belongs 4.0 the rank of
the imperialists. An Auntie or Ante is
assumed as one always wrong. In other
words state your own question and move
that the affirmative is always right and
shut off debate. Call names without
reference to their application. Appeal to
God and nature and. without waiting for
a reply, and you have an expansion argu
ment brought down to date and the
American Republic irrevocably embarked j
on a crusade of imperialism. Senators
Edmunds, Hoar Burrows and Hale. ex-
Speaker ReeJ, ex-President Harrison,
David Starr Jordan, Senator White and j
men of such repute make quite a dis
tinguished galaxy of traitors, Tories, Cop
perheads and Aunties. The list, if com
pleted, would Indicate that the financial
and commercial element in this Govern
ment was somewhat alarmingly in ad
vance of its brains and statesmanship as !
heretofore understood.
We have two classes of people advocat-
Ing expansion, one fervent but ill-advised
Christian enthusiasts who say that it Is
the band of Providence, the irresistible
force of God's will that we cannot stay,
and that we must extend our jurisdiction
and bring Christianity to those people.
Unmindful that Christ was the prince of ]
peace and told his disciples that his doc- !
trine should be promulgated without I
money and without price, and that his
representatives should journey without
the aid of the sword or man's govern
ment, bringing his pow.er to the attention i
of mankind, freely and in love and broth- |
erly kindness. It is to the shame of the
Christian world that a doctrine so beauti
ful should be brought to any people or i
thought to be heralded by a gTeat navy 1
and guns of Inconceivable destructive
power, great military force, Mauser rifles
and death-dealing instruments; heralding
the corning of Christ and with little less !
absurdity heralding the coming of the I
flag of the free and tho brave.
The other advocates of the same theory
of irresistible force are not the Christian
but the scientific people, who say that it
Is a cosmos force whereby we are work-
Ing out our irresistible destiny to an ir
resistible end; by the force of which â 
same argument If the right person should 'â 
appear proclaiming himself the Lord's
anointed, coming as the representative of
nature's great laws to assume imperial
jurisdiction over this people, we would of
necessity, but not of choice, hail this our
new Caesar. The whole theory of irre- !
sistible Providence, the whole theory of a
natural force beyond our control," is so
Oriental, dogmatic, inhuman and un-
American that it ought to be buried at
once.
This Government is not a rudderless
ship on a shore-loss sea, but this is the,
good old American ship of state guided'
and controlled by American manhood, '
American independence and J trust ulti
mately by American consistency.
We entered Manila and destroyed the
Spanish fleet without consent. We were .
never for a day a captor in the Manila '
harbor or in the Philippine Islands, un- |
less we chose to be. If we do wrong, if !
we go wrong, we, the American people
are to blame, not Providence or
any irresistible force of nature, and
while It may seem that the
policy has gone so far that it cannot be I
stopped or averted, I have always had an '
abiding confidence in the Intelligence of
the American people and In their loyalty
to the fundamental principles of 'their
Government
It Is well enough to talk of the great
race of modern nations for commercial
supremacy. We have succeeded in get
ting our share of the wealth and com
merce of the world without subverting or
abandoning democratic doctrines or the
principles upon which our Government
was founded. It is nol now necessari in
this race to abandon any single principle
If it were necessary 1 would be one to say

MISTER ALBERT HENDERSON,
head day porter at the Palace Ho
tel, Is not the same man lie was a
week ago. Habitues of uiat hos
telry have noticed for several (lavs past
that ho had a fugitive look in his eyes;
that he sidestepped and dodged as lf
dr.cking out of the way of an imaginary
enemy, and that he no longer, as was
his wont, engaged in the gentle art of
"joshing." Everybody immediately
Jumped to the conclusion that something
hud happened to Mister Henderson; that
some worm, concealed I' th' bud, was
eating nut the roseleaf of his daily life.
A worm, they argued, brought about
the fall cf the man in Eden, why might
not another worm work woe on a Pal
ace Hotel porter?
They went further Iâthey1 â they said It was a
tapeworm, judging from Mister Hender
son's Inordinate appetite for pie. The
day porter, In fact, has always been
very fond of pie. lie is not very par
ticular as to filling, but he's a stickler
for crust. Mince, or apple, or squash
or custard were all the same to him,
but thÂ« controlling force in. his appe
tite, whether or not It was a tapeworm.

by those who know that unless greater

terior kept Mister Henderson alive to
the fact that pie must be badâ no cheap,
skate pie, at that, but Palace Hotel pie.
As there was none to be bought, the
head porter tried to bribe the tapeworm
ing by consent of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners between Station D and the
dispatching department of a vaÃt amount
of daily mail on the wharf back of the
station. Imagine that the space allotted
to the postal authorities by the Harbor
Commissioners to be so limited on the
wharf that trucks, piled up high with mail
matter that must be expedited, are so
jammed together that they have hardly
room to move. Uncle Sam's faithful ser
vants are dally seen to be in a condition
bordering on desperation, owing to the
delays that are forced upon them on the
wharf. The situation within the station
proper Is not less exasperating.
limited in ground floor ppace the postal
authorities w^re compelled to take space
on the second floor. This involves the
use of an elevator and two men to run it;
also it Involved the construction of mail
trucks of a peculiar pattern and size to
just fit the elevator. The departments,
which ought to be all on the same floor,
are separated and the greatest possible
Inconvenience is caused. Some of these
troubles have existed ever since Station D
was moved into the ferry building, a
period of many months. The nore acute
annoyances have comÂ© abmt within
three months, the period during which the
express company has been carrying on
its dispatching business at the wharf.
With the advent of the express company
in its new location, directly back of Sta
tion D, such accommodations a,s were
formerly enjoyed by the postal people
have been very badly curtailed. Two
thirds of the wharf space formerly oc
cupied has been taken for the express
company's use.
Between wharves 3 and 4 is what
is known as a "dolphin," extending out
some distance Into the bay. On this
"dolphin " are sheds, plenty of light and
all 'the facilities. In a word, for the tranp
i of a large volume of dispatching
business. At the west, or shore end. of
the "dolphin" is a large open space,
adapted to the storage of unused trucks
or any other purpose needing space. This
last mentioned area, at the shore, end of
the "dolphin," was all used by the post
office people until the express company
found Its new location. Altogether the
express company has the use, at a rental
of *-."0 per month, of the space described
below and an office, at the rental of $250
per month, the office being on the wharf,
19 000 square feet on the "dolphin;" office
ppace on the ground floor 25x44 feet
and 10x50 feet. This is so good a thing,
considering the fact that the express dis
patching business has been taken there
to the wharf, and also the fact that there
is no need of artificial light during the
day that the express company would be
very loth to give up any of it.
The United States Government pays the
rum of $800 a month for space in the ferry
building and $75 additional for the space
on the wharf. What the Government geta
for that sum Is the following: Ground
floor of ferry building, 70 by 94 feet and
W 2 by 26Vi feet; second floor. 27 by 160
feet; space on the wharf, 2780 square feet.
Th" darkness of the premises on the
ground floo* compels the postal people
to burn artificial light largely, and the
lighting bills amount to between $250 and
$300 a month.
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28. 1899.
with a Mission-street mince, but he did
not succeed In throwing dust In its eyes.
For a time he fed it coffee and sinkers,
but it was no go. The wriggler that in
fluenced tha appetite would have noth
ing short of the Palace chef's own make.
There was only one thing left to do
and Mister Johnson dlt it. Very fre
quently he got fine cigars from pa
trons of the hotel whose luggage he
looked after. He bethought him of
these and of the chef. The rost was
easy. The head porter took frequent
occasion to make trips to the kitchen,
and he never failed to pass a perfecto
each trip to the pie man. In a short
time arapproachementwas established,
a sort of modus vivendi on pie, and tlÂ»e
head porter was not slow to improve
it. Mince, apple, custard and cran
berry came his way till further orders,
the worm V th' bud was content, and
things were going swimmingly till
another fated day.
A commercial traveler named Brown
did It up that color a few days ago,
and handed It to Mister Henderson.
The head porter, who had frequently
been presented with cigars by Brown,
The following facts will also impress
themselves upon the commercial commu
nity: Eighty per cent of the letter mall of
the city originates within a circle bound
ed on the west and east respectively by
Fifth street and the foot of Market stre-t.
Ninety-nine per cent of the newspaper
mail originates irw the same area. The
natural inference ts that the mail ought
to gr> to the nearest possible dispatching
point. This is at the foot of Market
street. By the use of that location it Is
possible to receive letters for mailing five
minutes before the starting of the ferry
boat, thus securing practically instantan
eous dispatch.
It is said upon good authority that an
Increase of 5 per cent even of the mail
above the present limit will force the re
moval of Station D. That increase will
soon be reached if the ratio is equal to
the growth of the past year, during which
period there has been added not less than
25 per cent, as the figures show conclu
sively. Consequently the matter is one
of urgency for the merchants to consider.
The station ought to be all on one floor.
To bring this about the wharf room for
the postoffkv must be greatly Increased.
The whole "dolphin" could be all utilized
and the Government would save largely
and have room to carry on its full vol
ume of business uninterruptedly for many
years. There is no place in sight as con
venient as the ferry depot. Within a pe
riod of four hours daily no less than 40,
--000 letters find their way into Station D,
which sufficiently illustrates the fact that
the location is convenient for all the
downtown business men, a prime consid
eration. The present arrangement has
another striking disadvantage; there is
no place for the mail wagons and horses
to stand. They arc not permitted to stand
In front of the ferry station; the pasÂ«Sage
way on the north of Station D is deadly
for horses by reason of the draught; back
of' Station I> there is no room.
The illustrations give an absolutely fair
idea of the difficulties under which the
mail service is now carried on when the
mails are heavy, such as on steamer day
or on the day of the sailing of a trans
port.
The portrait represents Fred Tlaase, the
energetic foreman of the nr-wspaper de
partment at the station. The elevator is
the one that the postal people are com
pelled to use continually to move the mail
from floor to floor in the station.
DAN BURNS HAS
BEEN SNUBBED
BY THE GOVERNOR
Humiliation From His
Creature.
Local politicians are all excitement
over the latest development of affairs in
the political family of Governor Gage.
The Governor has balked at the domina
tion of Burns and has made an assertion
of independence which is as unexpected
as it is startling 1 . His Excellency to the
surprise and consternation of his friends
has resisted a demand made by the Mexi
can, and everybody is wondering what is
to happen next. The wise ones see in the
action of the Governor the beginning of
the end for Burns, who is stinging under
the words of Gage that, *-U3urns has re
ceived enough from me. I want some
thing for myself."
The humiliation of the Mexican was I
forced upon himself through his greed j
for the few scraps of partonage that still j
remain on the gubernatorial table. There '
are two vacancies in the position of !
wharfinger on the water front. These '
places are among the best in the gift of ;
the Harbor Commission, and Burns want- ;
ed them for two of his retainers. He :
went, therefore, to Harbor Commissioner â 
Paris Kilburn and demanded them. Kil
burn, as a matter of political tact, gave !
a listening ear, but there was something
in his manner that indicated that things
were not as they used to be and that a I
request by the Mexican did not neces
sarily mean a command.
Kilburn said he would see about it. One I
of the two positions to be filled is now oc
cupied by Mike Smith, he of the whiskers.
Burns demanded that Mike, serviceable to
him in many ways, be retained. The other
vacancy the Mexican commanded be
filled by Assemblyman Miller of railroad i
pass fame. Miller was not on the Burns
Senatorial roll, but he was always in â 
signing distance of it, and a position as
wharfinger is not to be despised.
There was not tho slightest doubt in the ;
mind of Burns that his demand would be j
honored. He had no reason to believe j
that his ring had slipped from the nose of i
the Governor or that his Excellency was [
faltering in his subservient obedience.
Patronage had been awarded to the worst ;
of heelers and it could not be anticipated
that another dose would Sicken the Gov
ernor's stomach. But times had changed.
The ring had slipped from Gage's nose
and the chain was dangling idly and un
pro fit ably in the Mexican's hand.
Paris Kilburn saw the Governor and
told him that Burns had demanded the
two remaining places of importance on
the water front. It was then the Gov
ernor arose in his small dignity and â 
swelled with the assertion of himself.
"I want those places for myself," he I
said, "and I want you to hold them out j
for me. Burns has received enough from
me, nnd will get no more."
And that Is why the rabble of the Mex
ican are difturbod and are wondering If !
their leader has received his political j
conge from his creature who had been so I
obedient that no command seemed humili- j
ating enough for him to rebel against.

did not suspect the other morning,
when that person handed him a
large, fine, fat-looking cigar, that
there was anything wrong with it. It
may be that Brown didn't, but, at any
rate, he gave Mister Henderson a
cigar loaded to the muzzle with red
fire and explosives. The head porter's
eyes fairly danced in his head as he
patted the "smoke" and thought of
the nice cream pie the chef would
hand out when he received it.
Within a few minutes Henderson
was in the kitchen, the cigar was
lighted and inserted between the
chef's teeth, and the head porter, on
the opposite side of a table, wasn't
doing a thing to a magnificent pie.
All was smiles. Pouf! z-z-z-zip!
The next Instant all was confusion.
The cigar had exploded. The chef's
head went back and his hands went
up in horror. Mister Henderson div
a double somersault, and the precious
pie flew in all directions. The ex
plosion attracted the attention of all
the others in the kitchen, and they ran
to the Bcene. The chef was the first
SPLENDID NEW
BUILDING FOR
THE INSTITUTE
Plans for Mechanics'
Library.
CORBETT'S OFFER ACCEPTED
HE WILL MAKE THE DESIGNS
FREE OF COST.
Given Data Out of Which to Evolve
the Details of a Magnificent
Fireproof Six-Story
Structure.
In spite of the fact that seven out of
thirteen trustees of the Mechanics' Insti
tute voted at the last meeting against in
structing- a committee to submit a specific
plan for a new "downtown" building for
the library, plans for that purpose will
be drawn and submitted, and it is hoped
that at some time In the near future the
Mechanics' Library will be housed In a
I modern structure commensurate with its
importance.
For a long time it has been conceded
that the present library building was en
tirely inadeqvate and too antiquated for
the purpose to which it was dedicated. In
his annual reports, President E. A. Dcn
icke has called attention to the fact. Two
years ago he said:
In spite of all that has been done in this
and previous years the fact remains that
the library building- on Post street is Cast
becoming too limited in area for the various
purposes for which it Is used. The rapidly
growing library, as well as the general In
crease of membership, requires more ex
tensive quarters. The shelves are over
crowded and frequently seats in the library
ro. im are at a premium. The present ar
rangement of the library occupying four
rooms is Inconvenient and expensive. While
the location of our present library building
is admirable In every respect the building
ltÃelf is antiquated and inconvenient.
In his report this year he took occasion
to say on the same subject:
Does It not then behoove us, as custodians
of the second largest literary treasure on
this coast, to do Justice to the subject In
general, and to the wants of our members
In particularâ ln short, what I mean is, la
It not our Imperative duty to provide a
building for the Mechanics' Institute worthy
of Its purpose and its name?
No particular action was taken upon
this portion of President Denicke's re
port until a short time ago. when the trus
tees of the Institute received a letter from
Harvey W. Corbett. a son of Mrs. Dr.
Corbett, -who is now a student of architec
ture at Ecole dcs Beaux Arts, Paris. The
young San Franciscan explained that, as
it was one of the requirements of the
school that students for graduation should
submit plans for some building, he would
be glad to design, free of cost for the Me
chanics' Institute, a plan for a pavilion
to take the place of the present structure
on Larkin street, or for any other struct
ure the trustees might desire. This offer
was referred to a committee composed of
Horace Wilson, Colonel George H. Wallis,
Rodney Kendrick and E. A. Denlcke.
This committee decided that the Insti
tute needed a new library building more
than it did a parlor, and, proceeding on
that theory it drafted a letter of thanks
to Mr. Corbett, expressing a preference

to revive, and, wow, ho was angry.
He could see nothing in it, despite the
fact that the porter had received the
charge from the cigar full In the face,
but a Job put up on him by Hen
derson. With the chef to think was
to act and, while the astonished head
porter was pulling himself together
for an explanation, he saw the in
furiated pie man, armed with a
cleaver, making hostile advances in
his direction. The porter did not stop
to explain. Extending his legs as much
as possible he made all sorts of time
around the table, until he saw his op
portunity and managed to dash out
the door. After him ran the infuriated
chef, but the dusky fugitive was too
much for him and escaped.
That Is the story of Mister Hender
son's state of mind; that is why he
no longer Jokes; that Is why he looks
furtively and sidesteps without ap
parent provocation. The image of the
pursuing chef if ever In his mind. The
modus vivendi Is all off, but the pie
demon dwells still with Mister Hen
derson, and thera Is no way to ap
pease its appetite.
for a library building of the probable
cost of a quarter of a million dollars, with
the understanding, of course, that the
committee was giving no order for the
work. In the report of the Board of
Trustees at. their meeting Wednesday
night the committee held that the Post
street property was inadequate and that
some of the present realty holdings of the
Institute should be converted into cash
for the purpose of erecting a new one.
It asked that power be granted it to sub
mit a specific plan. This report met with
some opposition, the principal one beln*?
that the time was not ripe for the con
version of any of the realty. The opposi
tion won out on a vote and definite steps
in the direction of the new building were
not taken. This does not, however, pre
vent the drawing of the plans. In accord
ance with suggestions from President
Denicke they will be made In the hope
that, by the time they are ready for sub
mission, the point of view of the opposing
directors will have changed and they will
become supporters of the new building
idea.
The general data forwarded to Mr. Cor
bett by President Denicke, upon which
the young architect will work, provide for
a six-story fireproof building of stone and
iron, with basement, to set on a lot
100xl37VÂ£ feet; tho ground floor and base
ment for business purposes; second and
third and fourth floors for the Institute;
fifth floor for offices and studio; sixth
floor for a club. The Institute floors are
to contain, besides class rooms and a lec
ture hall to seat S<HJ, shelving space for
250,000 books, with no shelving higher than
eight feet. Provisions also to be made for
ladles' reception and reading roum and
gentlemen's smoking and chess rooms;
and for various rooms, half a dozen in
number, to shelve special collections of
books.
BRADBURY RELEASED.
He and Frenna Have a Wordy Alter-
cation in the County Jail.
Millionaire Bradbury was released from
the County Jail yesterday afternoon, he
having served his sentence of twenty-four
hours' imprisonment for expectorating in
a street car. Yesterday morning after
breakfast the prisoner found Joseph
Frenna, the slayer of J. F. Turner, sit
ting in the jail parlor, and the wealthy
gentleman did not like it. He make a
remark that it was an outrage that he
should be thrown in among murderers and
thieves.
This aroused the indignation of Frenna,
and he replied to Bradbury that Brad
bury had been convicted and was there
fore a convict, while he (Frenna) was not
a convict, but a man accused of crime.
He had killed a man in self-defense, he
said, while Bradbury had deliberately vi
olated tne law and was serving his sen
tence for doing it.
Bradbury was not released until after 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon. He had
cherished the hope that at 11 a. m. the
bolts would be sprung and he would be
declared a free man. He figured this out
from the fact that sentence of twenty
four hours' impiisonment was pronounced
upon him about 11 o'clock on the preced
ing day. But these things did not come to
pass und he raved and told his troubles
to the attendants cf the Broadway Jail
for about five hours longer than he had
expected to.
After Bradbury had learned his fate on
Tuesday he loitered about the City Prison
for several hours. He believed that his
sentence simply meant incarceration be
hind any old bars for a specified length
of time, and that the law was not particu
lar where they were situated. He had
friends in the City Prison and he thought
the time would pass more plea^&mly
there. So it was not until late in the aft
ernoon that the Sheriff took him to the
County Jail.
When 11 o'clock arrived yesterday morn
ing he picked up his hat and motioned to
the door. The attendant then explained
to fhe millionaire that the terms In hia
sentence were that he should serve twen
ty-four hours In a County Jail and that
his delay In arriving at that institution
cut no figure. As he had been booked at
3:30 on Tuesday his release could not oc
cur until the same time on Wednesday.
And it did not.

CHOICES OUT
DEFEATED
Good Sport at Oakland Track.
The Fretter and Pat Mor
rissey Winners.
For three short rounds at Oakland track
yesterday the .talent, was in distress, but
iatcr pulled itself together and. the vic
tories of The Frettcr and Pat Morrissey,
both pronounced favorites, replenished
the larder. Jerid, rica and Bogus Bill
al! scrambled in first at remunerative
prices.
After his "should have won" race of
the day before. Jack McCabe was In
stalled a hot favorite for the opening six
lurlcng sprint, decided under Belling con
ditions. He broke from the barrier as if
located on wooden underpinning and be
came lost in the shuffle at the start; Lona
Marie held the lead for a short time and
then , . it up to Jerid, which colt won
without difficulty from Lomo. The win
ner came, from the stable of P. Ryan.
Even with Thorpe up his odds drifted
from 2 to 5 to 1.
Ev. r since he got himself into trouble
for a bad-looking ride on I Don't Know,
.some two years go, "Quill" Morse has
not stood well with local turf t,oers. Af

beaten ho fell a few degrees lower In the
public's estimation. Morse apparently sat
astride tho best horse, but happened to
get pocketed on the backstretcn, losing
considerable ground, and was downed
with c-rLse by Tenrica, one of the second
choices, ridden by Jack Ward. Magnus
ran a close third.
The Klmwood stock farm also furnished
a warm favorite in Constellator for the
two-year-old dash that followed. Frank
Duffy had the leg up. and after showing
Fpeed for a few panels the Brutus young
ster gave it up. Bogus Bill, piloted by
Jones and second choice, assumed the
front position in the run home, beating
The Echo handily.
In the seven furlong handicap The
Fretter, favorite in the betting, had it all
to himself from the beginning. Shaking
off his company as the barrier was re
leased, he made all the running and won
in a gallop from February. Hohenzollern

goers of this caliber should watch and
not speculate on horses. Morse has been
in trouble und is r.ot the best rider In
the world, but his saddle work should be
judged impartially.
A bunch of Montana horses arrived at
Oakland track yesterday, among them the ;
Statcsberry string, headed by Crokef, a
fast but erratic performer; also White i
fern, a clever filly.
Don Cameron was another arrival. He
brought along Senator Bland, Mallakwa
iind Dr. Nebula, the latter a crack miler.
. Meropa and the balance of Miller & Blaz
ers' horses came out in the same car.
The Corrigan stable was due to arrive

Frank Duffy will do the heavy-weight
riding for the Boots stable in future.

LAST TOUCHES ON THE YACHTS BEFORE THE RACES.
Np:W YORK, Sept. 27.â The Sham
rock was to-day safely dry
docked at Erie bcain. Every
precaution was taken to prevent
mishap to the big cutter and
twenty minutes after she was warped
Int<> position over the twelve blocks at
the bottom of the dock, her keel was
resting securely in place. Th>-rf> was
no attempt to hide the lines of the.
yacht from view. The yard was open
to the public from morning until night
and hundreds of yachtsmen stood for
hours while the water was being
pumped out that they might get a look
at i lie underbody and keel <>f the chal

secrecy and so the "clouts' and "petti
coats" that prevented the people from
seeing the Shamrock when she. was
launched in England early this summer
uml afterward when she was docked
at the Erie basin shortly after reach
ing this country were not used. Every
one had a fine look at the craft.
The Shamrock lay alongside the
partly burned steamer Bucaros all
night and early this morning her crew
was put to work scraping off the green
paint that covered her topsldes, expos
ing the true metal underneath. Just j
what metal these two upper streaks of I
plates are composed of is a secret, but j
it looks much like a composition of
aluminum and nickel, very light and at !
the snnv time very strong. It is quite
probable that tin- Shamrock will not
have her upper body repainted for fear
it may r-n.-ird her speed. Captain
Wr!nge, wrben ask<-d about the matter,
said he did not know about the paint, |
but if any was put on it would bo the i

SENORITA IS
RETURNED AN
EASY WINNER
Secures the Midwezk Stake
at Union Coursing Park
by Default.
Connell Brothers' Senorita won the
reserve stake at Union Coursing Park
by Fault. She worked her winning way
through the various rounds of the stake
and should have met Acneid Kennel's
Pretender In the final. In the two pre
vious rounds Pretender had been run to
a standstill, and was not lit to go to the
slips again. His owners wisely withdrew
him rather than risk losing him. In the
! . xt to the last round he defeated Miaimo
by a score of l'> to 1. In the preceding:
round he defeated Winona by a score of
15 to 9.
The day was an ideal one for coursing,
and the moderate sized stake provided
all the sport those In attendance could
desire. Juanita, which won at 20 to 1 at
the meeting last Saturday, won at 5 to 1
yesterday. She defeated One Spot by a
score of*ls to 4. She was in turn beaten
in the next round by Wadena, the score
bring S to 3. Belle of Anderson had two
severe courses, defeating Joker by a
score of 22 to â ! and Rustan by a score of
27 to 8. In the next round she was put
out by Pretender, the score being 11 to 1.
Random Aim beat Magneto by a score of
3 -to 1. The betting was at the same
figures, Magneto being favorite.
Aeneas and Winona were both short
enders at the odds of l to 2, the former
lefeating St. Michael and the latter Non

their course, but was finally beaten by a
score of 7 to 5.

ctevt was at or.cc put to work in two
squads serubbinp the hull with brush*-*.
The Shamrock is a powerful craft,
with her greatest beam about whore
the masthead runners fasten to the
deck. The underbody, which is of
bronze, was covered with a sort of
slime, which came off readily with a
vigorous application of salt wator and
brushes, leaving the plates shiny and
smooth. When the hull and keel were
fully exposed there were expressions of
disappointment mi all sides.
Th< experts expected to see some
thing new and a radical departure
from the old type of English cutter.
The Shamrock can be described as a
vessel with a Britannia body and a
Defender fin and lead, including the
latter's rocker keel, but with greater
draught than either. There is nothing
particularly handsome about the cut
ter's lines, except that they are ali
curves, there being no straight ones
except from the turn of the guard
boards to the lead.
In comparison with the Columbia the
Shamrock is fuller bodied, especially
amidships, and has about a foot more
beam and a draught about ten inches
greater. Her overhangs are shorter, so
that her lines are not so well
carried out as in the Columbia, and,
being short, increase the look of bulki
ness. Then she is higher sided than
the cup defender. She has a rocker
keel like the Defender; that is, her lead
keel is rounded up like that of the '95
champion, but a little more at the bow
than the latter. Her lead keel is about
as thick as the Columbia's, but not
nearly fo deep. From 4^ to 5 feet is
a fair estimate, while the cup defend
er's is about eight feet. The lead on
the keel weighs about fifteen tons less
than the Columbia's, or about eighty
tons, but as it is about five feet longer
than the latter's, or about thirty-three
feet, and not nearly so deep, it puts
the ballast lower and therefore gives
the Shamrock fully as much if not

Th" Shamrock carries more sail than
the Columbia, as her mast is stepped
about two f^et farther aft, giving her
more headsail, while the mainsail is
also larger than the cup defender's.
The Shamrock's amidship sections are
continuous curves from the deck lines
to the turn of the garboard. Her bilge
hardens greatly at the quarter, just
opposite to the Columbia's, and gives
one the impression that it will retard
her progress in sailing.
Amidship the Columbia has a line
almost straight from the bilge to gar
board, giving her a flatter floor, while
the Shamrock is full and round.
When the lead keel was exposed it
was found to be unlike the Columbia's
in that it is unprotected by bronze. It
is painted with a Fort of red composi
tion to protect it from the action of the
salt water, but the crew had consider
able work in cleaning off the slimy
coating.
When the hull of the cutter had been
well scrubbed the crew commenced
putting up a staging about, the craft
and will use electric polishers on her
metallic sides to-morrow.
Dry dock No. 3, at the Brooklyn
navy yard, was made ready to-day for
the reception of the yacht Columbia,
the Navy Department having given its
consent for the yacht to be hauled out
there, the Erie basin dock being oc
cupied exclusively by the Shamrock.
At 2 p. m., after the big dock had
bpen pumped dry, the dockmaster and
a gang of men began to set up the keel
blocks, according to the docking plans
furnished by the Herreshoffs. Scaf
folding and shores were brought to the
dock and by sundown everything was
ready to receive the yacht.
The Columbia left her moorings at
New Rochelle at noon and was towed
through Hell Gate and the East River,
arriving at the navy yard before dark.
She will be put in the dock early to
morrow morning, at slack water, it is
said, which will be about 9 o'clock.
GOSSIP OF THE
BASE RUNNERS
AND BATTERS
Standing of the Four Nines.
San Francisco Will Have
Several Charges.
Sacramento still holds the head of the
column. Last week the enthusiasts were
anxiously waiting for the game between
the Dudes and Senators, on account of the
great form-showing of Cal Ewing's men.
For three weeks the Invigorated Oak
landers played most excellent ball and
there were several large bets made that
Oakland would attach two of the three
games.
The sudden burst of speed as exempli
fied by the Dudes was due to faultless
play and good hitting. Then came the re
turn to former methods. Seven errors in
one game and six in another do not re
dound much to the credit of the Oakland
team. The result of the game on Sun
day afternoon which was won by the
Dudes was due to the slaughtering of
Harvey's curves, not to any excellence on
the part of the victors.
By the winning of two matches the
leaders increased their lead somewhat,
while Fan Francisco and Santa Cruz oc
cupy about the same relative position, a
close liÃht for second place. Oakland is
still a bad fourth and it will be some time
li â¢â :'â  re that team is anything elseâper
haps next season. The standing of the
clubs is as follows:
The umpire question is still agitating
the league. Mr. William I,ong, who stood
in judgment upon balls and strikes and
the Keneral play last week when Oakland
met Pan Francisco, is certainly not the
greatest umpire that has worked on Cal
ifornia diamonds. It seems as if the
league cannot handle the umpire problem
successfully. At present a very capable
umpire 'is in town in the person of John
F. Sheridan, too well known to the San
Francisco baseball public to need more
identification tl>an his name. At present
a deal is on to engage him for the rest of
the season and he may be seen on the
Recreatl6n Park diamond this week.
When San Francisco lines up Saturday
there will be a decided change in the per
sonnel and positions. Swindells, who has
a very bad hand, has been replaced by
Sullivan. Courtney will cover the first
bag and Muller will be brought into serv
ice in the field.
Oakland missed Francks in last Sun
day's game.
Harvey would better dose himself with
some animating drug. His slowness is
painful.
Schmeer distinguished himself in a
couple of ways last Saturday and Sun
day, by some sensational stops and by
some glittering errors.
HiUchinson played a wonderful game at
llrst last week.

THE RECORD
FOR PACERS
LOWERED
Eumps Clips a Second and
a Half Off the Mark
of Joe Patchen.
Br>erial Dispatch to The Call.
LOriSYTLLE. K>\, Sept. 27.â Amid the
enthusiastic plaudits of a big crowd at
the fair grounds this afternoon th<-> little
brown gelding Rumps, owned by W. K.
Billings of Chicago, trained by G. R. Bent
ley and driven by W. L. Snow, broke the
world's wagon pacing record of 2:04%. for
! merly held by Joe Patchen. The mile was
i paced in 2:(Wi. a second and a half better
than the record. The little gelding, mov
ing like a piece of clockwork, did not fal
â  ter during the journey from wire to wire
' and reeled off the quarters with the
j swinging stride of the trained cam

seconds more, having traveled all but the
flnai quarter of his mile in 1:31. The
grand stand, wildly excited, roso to its
feet. Would the little pacer hold out in
his wonderful burst of speed? The ques
tion was soon answered, for in 32Vi sec
onds more Bumps had passed under the
wire in 2:O3Vi, holder of the world's record.
Trainer Bentley was beside himself with
excitement' and pleasure as the crowd
flocked out on the track to shake his
hands and pat the little horse on the back.
The track was fast, but a light wind was
blowing. But for this the mark set by
Bumps to-day would have been still
lower.

Kid McCoy Easily Wins From
the Big Philadelphia
Bruiser.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â Before 4000 peo
ple at the Lenox Athletic Club to-night
Kid McCoy clearly proved that Jack McÂ«
Cormaek of Philadelphia won by a fluke
a few weeks ago in Chicago, when he
knocked McCoy out. They met at catch
weights for a twenty-round go, and. Mc-
Coy reversed matters in a very thorough
manner. He simply smothered the big
wrestler and made him look like a novice.
He sent him down several times, but Mo.
Cormaek was not satisfied with these
breathing spelis, as he lay down several
times without receiving a punch. He also
transgressed the rules by holding and
wrestling, and was frequently cautioned.
Ho feigned being groggy a couple of times
and tried to catch McCoy < ft his guard
so that he could swing his" right over, tfc*
Coy was not to be fooled by these wiles
and kept on the alert all the time. HÂ«
would certainly have put McCormack to
sleep had the big fellow stood up and
fought like a man. The spectators be
came disgusted with McCormack's ac
tions, and so did Referee Charley White,
who sent him to his corner in the eighth
round on account of his dropping, and de
clared McCoy the winner.
Before the light McCoy was the favor
ite at 10 to 3. Even money was wagered
that the fight would not last six rounds.
After the men had entered the ring Peter
Maher challenged the winner. McCor
mack looked twice as big as McCoy.
Round Iâ McCoy led off and McCo"rmack
backed away. The Kid then led to the
face. McCormack clinched and was cau
tioned for holding, and in the. breakaway
caught the Kid with his left in the face.
McCormack rushed and then came to a
clinch, and McCormaik shoved the Kid
to the floor and fell on him. McCormack
rushed and got in a light left to the neck
and to the chest. McCoy was taking no
chances and was very wary.
Round 3â McCoy landed a right swing
on the point of the jaw, which knocked
McCormack on his back. He took the
limit to get up. and rushed wildly at Mi -
Coy. who sidestepped and planted a hard
right <>n the eye. McCormack rushed in,
but McCoy m>-t him with a right upper
cut on the chin. McCormack chopped a
left to the chest, and then the Kid
rushed him to the corner and landed a
left on the jaw. McCormack slipped and
McCoy fell over him. The bell rang when
McCormack had regained his feet.
Round 3 â McCormack tried rushing
without getting in a blow. He rushed
and shoved McCoy across the ring, and
in the breakaway McCoy caught him on
the head with his left and a clinch fol
lowed. Jack was cautioned for holding.
Jack rushed again, but McCoy evaded
him and swung right to head. The bell
found them sparring.
From the fourth to the eighth round
McCormack did no effective work, .tie
constantly clinched and went down to
save punishment.
Round Bâ McCoy opened with a rlgJic to
the body. Jack clinched, and the Kid gave
him five or six rights over the kidneys
and then sent him down with a right up
percut. After this there was no more

BEFORE THE GOVERNOR
Formal Charges Are Filed and
Investigation Demanded.
Dr, L, T, Cranz Is Ready to Prove That
the Defendant Was Bought and
Stood Ready to Be Bought.
THERE need no longer be delay or
evasion in the official considera
tion of the scandal in the State
Beard of Dental Examiners.
Formal charges of corruption
and malfeasance in office have been
preferred by Dr. Louis T. Cranz
against Dr. F. F. Tebbets, and an im
mediate and searching investigation
has been demanded from the Governor
and from Dr. G. S. Baehman, the
president of the State Board of Den
tal Examiners. The accusations,
signed by Dr. Cranz, are now in tho
hands of Dr. Baehman, and will be re
ceived by the Governor this morning.
The iesue is plainly defined. An officer
of a State institution has accused an
.â â thrr of most serious offenses, and an
lnv< stigatlon must follow as an inevit
able result.
Dr. Cranz has not mixed words in his
formal charges. He accuses -Dr. Teb
bets of having- agreed to accept bribes
and in consideration to give his offi
cial vote, opinion and action. Dr. Teb
bets is charged with having entered
Into secret compacts with certain per
sons for a money consideration to give
them the dental certificates required by
law. The accused officer has been
charged with having sold and offered to
sell the examination questions which
were to be asked applicants for dental
certificates.
In conclusion Dr. Cranz charges that
Dr. Tebbets has made the function of
his office a matter of sordid bargaining
and personal gain, and that he has
Btood bought and to be bought for a
pecuniary consideration. With these
most Berious accusations Dr. Cranz
demands that a time and a place be
fixed for investigation.
These accusations, as already mdi.
. have been received by Dr. G. S.
Baehman and have, been sent by mail
to the Governor. In both instances the
charges are identical. Those sent to
Dr. Baehman, having been received by
him, are given in full as follows:
San Francisco. Sept. 27, 1899.
Dr. G. S. Baehman, President State
Board of Dental Examiners, 6 Eddy
street, San Francisco â Sir: I hereby
file this written charge against Dr.
F. F. Tebbets, as a member of the
State Board of Dental Examiners. I
charge the said Dr. F. F. Tebbets with ,
wrongful and unlawful acts as a
member of said board. I charge him
with having agreed to receive bribes
upon the agreement and understand
ing that his vote, opinion and action
would be influenced thereby. He has
entered into secret compacts with per
sons who desired to appsar before said
board and be examined with reference
to thpir knowledge and skill in den
tal surgery, as required by law, that
for a certain money consideration by
them to him, the said Dr. F. F. Teb
bets. in hand paid, the said persona
paying said money would receive
from said Board of Examiners a cer
tificate that they were found to pos
sess the requisite qualifications de
fined by the act passed by the Legis
lature of the State of California to in
sure the better education of practi
tioners of dental surgery, and to reg
ulate the practice of dentistry in this
State. He has sold and offered to sell

I Grape=Nuts i
A man said, when he was a boy his
grandma used to brown some slices of
bread and pound them up in an old
mortar and feed them with milk to his
brothers and himself.
He remarked that he believed Grape-
Nuts, the famous food, was made in
the same way, but a gentleman in the
party remarked that he had Investi-
gated Grape-Nuts carefully and found
that the grain from which it was made
was perpared by various processes of
long soaking, warmth and time, by
"which the peculiar element undÂ«r the
shell of wheat and barley is developed.
This element Is called diastase and Its
work is to change the starch of grains
Into grape-sugar. This same process
Is gone through with In the human
body [when any whole grain prepara-
tion is used, such as rolled wheat or
oats, or entire wheat bread. But the
trouble is that so many people are
weak In their Intestinal digestion, an 1 \
bread and the starch containing cereals
are not properly digested, thus produc- ;
ing gas and bowel complaints, often ;
endin- in appendicitis or kindred dif-
ficulties. Grapc-Xuts food, being pre- ;
digested mechanically before going into
the human body, is ready for quick and
easy assimilation, and people of weak \
digestion can thus obtain the full value j
from a healthful and most nourishing
natural food. The flavor of Grape-
Nuts is a delicate sweet, that of true
grape sugar to be seen glistening on
the little particles. This sugar is not
ridded to them, but is produced in the
change from starch to grape-sugar and
evolved In the processes, j The famous
food is sold by all first-class grocers
and made by the Postum Cereal Co., '
Ltd., at Battle Creek, Mich. â  -|,
the examination questions which
were to be asked applicants for cer
tificates by the Board of Examiners.
I charge that he has made the func
tion of his office a matter of sordid
bargaining and personal gain, and
that he has stood bought and to be
bought for pecuniary consideration.
I am prepared to show every fact
necessary to constitute his malfeas
ance and to prove beyond reasonable
doubt that he is guilty as herein
charged.
I respectfully request that you im
mediately appoint a time and place
for the investigation of the said acts
of venality and official corruption by
and on the part of said Dr. F. F. Teb
bets as a member of the State Board
of Dental Examiners. Very respect
fully, LOUIS T. CRANZ.
As both the Governor and the presi
dent of the State Board of Dental Ex
aminers have been asked to appoint a
time and a place for an investigation,
it is probable that these officers will
consult upon the best course to pursue.
The attorney for Dr. Cranz considered
it wise to make the same request to
both officers, as there is some question
in reference to the right of either to
take the initiative in such a matter.
There is not the slightest ques
tion that the State Board of Den
tal Examiners has the right to inves
tigate the conduct of its officers or
members, but the power of removal in
the event of a verdict of guilty
rests with the Governor. The peculiar
circumstances of this case, in which so
many charges have been made and in
which more than one reputation is at
stake, recommend an investigation by
the Governor.
Dr. F. 11. Metcalf of Sacramento yes
terday sent a communication to The
Call, in which he denied that he ever
heard of the laboratory incident in con
nection with Dr. Morffew; never had
any conversation with Dr. Harris and
did not know him by sight from the
rest of the applicants until after the
examinations were concluded. He also
feels certain that Dr. Harris will bear
him out in this statement. He thinks
the idea of his telling a man he was
doomed is simply ridiculous.

Paddy Purtell Defeats Charley Goff
After Six Rounds.
DENVER, Sept. 27.â Paddy Purtell of !
Denver defpated Charley Ooff of Spokane
to-night in six rounds before the Olympic I
Athletic Club. The men were scheduled
to light twenty rounds at the middle
weight limit. T"p to the very end of the
fight Goff had all the better of it. He
overmatched Purtell both In hHght and I
in reach, and Jabbed him repeatedly with
his left without a return. His favorite
blow Was a left jab to the face and hard
right hook to the ribn, and he did thip in
the first two rounds without Purtell being |
able to counter effectively.
In the third, fourth and fifth rounds |
Purtell, though not landing nearly as
often as Goff, occasionally found his neck j
and chin with good straight lofts. Goff j
k<-j't up his left jabbing and Purtell's eyes :
began to show th<- effects of it.
In the sixth round Purtell commenced
forcing matters. Ji" landed a stiff left i
on Golf's neck and a light right hook
ribs in return. Then Purtell rushed j
and swung hie 1' !'t to the neck, follow
ing it with a terti'ic right swing to the
jaw Goff went down and came up j
groggy. Purtell cime again with a hard
left swing and Goff clinched to save him- !

MINING ENGINEERS TALK;
TRAVEL AND BANQUET
After Greeting and Speeding They Start on Their State Tour
This Morning.
THERE were three main features to
the proceedings of the last day
of the California meeting of the
American Institute of Mining En
gineers yesterday.
The formal and last session in
the forenoon at the Palace Hotel saw
the presentation of a number of papers
that will be of much interest and value
to the members of this great organization.
From noon to evening the visiting party
and others enjoyed a pleasant and profit
able trip to tho University of California,
and especially to Its College of Mining,
and then to the Selby Smelting Works up
the bay shore.
Then the eaxly evening saw the glow of
incandescent lights over five long and
handsomely arrayed tables, which filled
the Maple Room at the Palace Hotel, and
to which nearly 200 members of the in
stitute and members of the local business
and professional worlds sat down. The
occasion was a banquet to the members
of the institute present tendered by the
mercantile community of San Francisco.
The tables were handsomely decorated,
the menu was elaborate and when late in
Incidents of the Last Day of the Miners.
the evening the time for post-prandial
talk arrived the speeches that followed,
mingling wit and wisdom in appropriate
%\i',s that commanded now silr-nt and se
riniis appreciation and now hearty laugh
tÂ» ;â  ;ind applause, made the occasion tho
chief social and one of the important in
tellectual feature of the meeting.
At the head of the table sat A. A. Watkins,
president of the Board of Trade; Presi
dent Douglas, Secretary Raymond, Mayor
James D. Phelan and other distinguished
members of the institute and their hosts,
seated on either hand.
When the time came for the jolly small
talk of the social board to be succeeded
by t ht more formal expressions of ir.tt-1
lectual and social fraternity Chairman A.
A. Watkins spoke words of greeting and
congratulation, bidding the guests wel
come and to be merry, partially as fol
lows:
All California loves a miner. California was
born a mining State and Is one to-day. I know

faults, but I know that In IS9B the mineral
product of th.c United States was 76 per cent
of the agricultural product of this great agri
cultural country an d that the success of this
great and growing mineral industry is due
mainly tn Intelligence, judgment and Rkillâne
cessities which have made the mining engineer
more In present active demand than he of any
profession In the world.
James Douglas, president of the insti
tute, gracefully expressed the gratitude
of the guests for the very hearty wel
cme received on this Western coast.
"California was the starting point of
active mining in this country," said the
speaker. Continuing the reminiscent
vein thus introduced, he recalled Pro
fesor Blake as a fine specimen of the
paleozoic age of California's mining, and
he spoke with especially tender and ap
preciative recollections of Benjamin Sil
liman and W. C. Ralston, and what they
did for Western mining in their day.
"In looking over your State," said the
speaker, "there is one thing I antici
pate. You will one day take a leading
place in the field of manufacturing In
dustry, and be not merely a great pro
ducer". The United States is producing 60
per cent of the world's copper, and of this
three-quarters comes from the Western
States. The largest part of it goes to
Europe to be used in manufactures.
Why should it not be manufactured on.
our own coast and sent in our own ships
to the great Oriental region where so
much of it is being and will be con
sumed?"
"The California Miners Association
was responded to by John J. Davis of
Amador County, who gave a brief re
view of the story of the organization and
then said:
During the reception that we propose to give
j you we will show you that the great gold fields
of this State have yet been hardly scratched.
! Beaidea our hospitality there are things to
which the California Miners' Association asks
I your serious attention. Particularly we ask
j your attention to our two great problems of the
I rehabilitation of hydraulic mining and the con
servation of our mountain waters.
Irving M. Scott replied in a delightful
way to "Tho Early Mining Engineer in
California." and when David Starr Jor
j dan spoke brierl\ in his inimitable way on
! "The Training of Mining Engineers" he
; said that the miner needed four big Msâ
j mountains, mines, maps and men. We
had them in California.
Secretary Rossiter W. Raymond spoke
lof "Mining Experts and Mining Laws"
i and Professor E. B. Christy on "The
j American Institute of Mining Engineers."
i Mayor Phelan was one of others who
added to the pie asure of the evening,
which included music by an orchestra
and by the California Quartet.

DEATH CLAIMS A WELL
KNOWN PIONEER PRINTER
A DISPATCH from Boise, Idaho, I
announces the death, after a pro- I
longed illness, of Edward T. I
Plank, one of the most widely I
known printers on the Pacific Coast.
Edward T. Plank was born in Cats- I
kill, New York, and at the time of his I
death was about 63 years of age. He I
attended the public schools there until, I
at the age of 16. he entered the office I
of the Catskill Democrat as an appren- I
tice. The close application he gave to I
his work soon undermined his health, I
and he determined to take a sea voy- I
age. He shipped on a whaler, and after I
a two years' voyage reached Califor- I
nia and again embarked in the print- I
ing business. lie became an active I
champion of organized labor and was I
identified with the Eureka Union as I
far back as 1857, and in 1863, in Washoe, I
was a charter member of the first I
union organized in Nevada.
The next year he went to Montana I
and assisted in getting out the first I
number of the Montana Post, at Yir- I
ginia City. He left that journal to try I
his hand at mining and after two years I
of indifferent results he again went to I
work on that paper, but for a short I
time only as he soon journeyed to De- I
troit. where he afterward held several I
positions in the union, and was De- I
trolt's delegate to Montreal in 1873. In I
1576 he went to the Black Hills for someinonth^andthenreturnedto^N?
vada and California, He was elected to the Nevada Legislature in the early
SO s, and after considerable traveling on the coast he located in San Fran
cisco, and In 1887 was elected delegate to Buffalo from there.
At Buffalo he was elected vice president of the International Union. Re
turning to San Francisco he was elected president of San Francisco Typo
graphical Union No. 21, and the following year, at Kansas City, was elected
president of the International Union, and held office for two terms, declining
nomination for a third term. ,
Mr. Plank was held in great esteem by the craft and at the culmination
of his services as president, in Boston, was presented with a valuable watch,
suitably inscribed, by the delegates.
He was considered a cool and level-headed man, and displayed marked
ability as a presiding officer, where his tact and judgment often brought vic
tory out of apparent defeat in the settlement of strikes.
Among the radical elements he was noted for his conservatism and was
opposed to strikes, except as the very last resort.

The Hay Market.
The circular of Someni & Co. 'says of Hay:
â â¢Receipts for the week ending, to-day have
been very heavy, the total being close on to
6000 tons. The arrival of two large barge loads
containing close on to 1000 tons has helped to
swell receipts to this high total.
"It must now be admitted that the- market Is
eoirowhat weaker than at any time previous
this season. We have had two or three months
of heavy receipts and It is not at all surpris
ing that many of the consumers are out Of
the market, having purchased their winter sup
ply. In fact it has been somewhat surprising
that the market has absorbed the great quan- |
tity that has been shipped are in the face of j
the fact that the consumption in San Francisco
is not what It should be. nor has it increased as
the city has grown. Another fact that has
made itself felt on the -market- lately Is that
there is very little, if any. of the choicer vari
eties of either wheat or tame oat hay shipped
in Everything seems to be of fairly good '
quality what might be termed medium grade ;
hay. which keeps the market in a very uninter : ,
estinc condition and Is now allowing it to
weaken a bit. It is also a notable fact that
very little poor hay is being marketed; about
the only grade that Bells for less | than ,l6 >''' : \, "
Is barley hay from the river districts. Ordin
arily li times like these when hay is plentiful
and prices low, there Is much poor hay shipped
in that sells from *4Â©5 per ton. but this year
nothing of the kind can be noted. ;
"The situation in the country shows praetl- ;
callv n^ change. There is yet a large quantity
of ha? out of .J.ws not baled. In some places
it is quite probable that this will not be ba \e d.
but Will be thatched or housed over for winter
feed but much eood hay that will be pressed
still remain* In the .tack. Thus far there has
been no rain, but iit is l the general opinion
toat much hay will be wet by the early rains.'.'

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.â stock market
fell a degree further to-day toward stagnation
and the activity, such as It was, showed an ;
added tendency to center In a few specialties. :
Tennessee Coal was relatively much more
prominent than for some time and registered
an extreme decline of 6% points. American To
bacco ehowed the continued effects of the pres
sure to which it has recently been subjected
up to the time of the announcement of the
declaration of the regular dividends. The'
weakness in these two stocks served to hold
back the market, which showed a tendency to
advance from an early period in the day. Bet
ter advices from abroad made the opening
higher, and the announcement of an additional
engagement Of $750,000 In gold in London for im
port added tp the convictions that the exchange
situation admitted of regular Import operations.
The continued high price for money in spite of
the gold engagement served as a setback to
the advance, jis was the case yesterday, but
late In the day rumors were industriously, cir
culated of the early approach of gold imports
on a large scale. At the same time the money
rate was quickly offered down by successive j
stages to 3 per cent, but before 2 o'clock call '
loans had been made all the way from 12 to 20
per cent. It was said that money could have
been had at lower rate on some high-grade
railroad stocks, but the higher range was that
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Even, on the
higher grade of collateral the margin required
â was widened materially. + Under cover of their
requirement and of what were called commis
sions, there was room for considerable manipu
lation of the quoted rate. This was true in the
time loan market, in which there was consid
erable demand for short loans, aB well as in
the call loan department. Very little Is doing
in mercantile paper, but rates are firm. Pre
dictions of a favorable bank statement to-mor
row, under which date the clearing-house in
btltutlons are to make their weekly return,,
were a factor in the firmness of the market.
The outgo to the sub-treasury will ]>â¢â¢ something
less than half a million dollars. Shipments to
the Interior have continued on a considerable
ecale. How far they have been offset by small
sums here and there, attracted by the high
money rate, cannot be clearly estimated. So
far as stock market operations bo, there has
evidently been a further contraction of ' loans.
The character of the statement will largely de
pend on how far the demand for accommoda
tions In preparations for October first settle
ments has offset this contraction. The move
ment of prices in the railroad list was very
narrow. Atchison preferred, enjoyed a belated
demand on account of its August statement,
and Southern Pacific rose quite strongly late
in the day. T.he stringency of the money mar
ket. resulted In a decline In the sterling ex
change rate In spite of the further advance in
the private discount rate In London. The bond
market was without any special feature, . but ,
was inclined to firmness. Total Bales, par
value. $1,050,000.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sept. 27. â Wheat, traders were In- ;
fluenced at the start by the action of the Liver
pool market, which showed but a slight decline
at the opening there and soon recovered that
and more. Northwest, receipts were compara
tively light, but the Impression prevailed that
this was due to a scarcity of cars and would
be succeeded by correspondingly heavy arri
vals later, and for the time being had no ef
fect on trading. The Liverpool firmness was
reflected by an opei.ing advance of Vi@%c here,
Decembfr starting at 73V;Â®73%c and under
good buyingâ by local professionalsâ
further sllcht advance took place, December
getting to 7S%c, but the buying movement soon
became quite general, and though no marked
advance took place, the market was firm to
the end of the session. A good deal of atten
tion was given to the small receipts at To
ledo St. Louis and Kansas City, and they wen*
one of the bull incentives of the late trading.
The market, rather quiet at first, became quite
active before noon, and December gradually
advanced to 73% c. There was considerable
realizing at the bulge and some selling against
calls and the price was hammered down to
73% C. But at that point it was steadily main
tained, and closed firm at 73% c bid. Septem
ber was seldom heard from. A few offerings
early in the session caused a decline to 73% c,
but before the close It had rallied to 74% c, an
advance of %c over yesterday. .A good export
business was done. The selling movement was
freest shortly before the close. Estimates of j
365,000,000 bushels for the French crop, the larg- i
est ever known, had some Influence on traders. I
Corn was quiet, active and firm for the more
remote futures, but decidedly weak for Sep
tember. There were heavy additions to the
contract stocks out of private houses and ele
vator concerns offered freely, the price declin
ing sharply under the liquidation. Early in
the session' there was also considerable , De
cember liquidation, but later that option be
came firmer, helped by wheat and the immense
export engagementsâ lso loads. . Belief that the
contract stocks would be ample â¢by Saturday
to fill the shorts influenced trading. December
closed unchanged at SOc; September closed l%c
lower at 33c.
Oats were inactive and steady. There was a
fair demand from shorts for December, and
an inclination to dispose of September, which
resulted in a disappearance of the slight Sep
tember premium. .The December strength whs
entirely with wheat. The demand for foreign
account was large and 100 loads were reported
engaged for export. December closed %c high
er at 22% c.
Provisions, though sluggish, were firm. Liv- ]
erpool continued to advance and there was '
more outside trade. Most of to-day's trading
â¢vvaÃ conlmed to changing over from October to
January products. January pork closed 7%c I
higher at ?952%: January lard 5@7 1 . 2 c higher
at $5 62%, and January ribs 2%c higher at

OVERDREW THEIR
SUPPLY ACCOUNT
WITHOUT LEAVE
Gedge and Conlan in
Troubie Again.
ACCUSED OF EXTRAVAGANCE
SCHOOL BOARD ORDERS MANY
CHANGES.
Teachers Assigned and R-eassigned.
Heads of Departments Reinstated
in Their Old Positions
With New Duties.
School Directors Conlan and Gedge
spent a very unpleasant half-hour at last
jiight's meeting of the Board of Educa
tion. By nearly every one of their fellow
members they were severely censured for
having spent $3500 for school furniture
which was not absolutely needed, sit a.
Time when the schools' finances are In
such a precarious condition. Director
Stoive opened on them with the statement
that it was to be regretted that they had
broken a rule of the board and expended
that -amount of money without any au
thorisation. He suggested that the bills
be repudiated aaid the goods returned to
Weber & Co., the linn from which they
were bought.
Director Holbrook, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, said that a member of
the tirm had called upon him and threat
ened to begin suit against his bondsmen
in case the board did not pay the claim.
Mr. Hoi brook said that when the board
organized the amount which the Supplies
Committee could expend monthly was
lixed at 42500, but that owing to the con
dition of the nances that amount was
practically reduced to $10u0. He also de
veloped the tact that the Supplies Com- 1
mittee had overspent its account by from
J15.W0 to JiJo.Ow. Director Head got i
into the light, and said that he had gone
out to Investigate schools which were said
to be in need of furniture and had found j
hundreds of desks stored In cellars and ]
vacant buildings. The desks he had put 1
In the schools in place of others tnat i
needed repairing, but that Instead of re- j
1 airing them Conlan bad had them broken
up ana the iron work thrown on the scrap
heap.
Director Stafford moved that the bills
i.: Weber & Co. be repudiated, which
would have amounted to a censure ut
Gedge and Conlan. Both of them at
tempted to gut out from under, but tailed
to do so. Director randi nsteln said that I
the contractors were theoretically inno
cent parties to the transaction, and the j
claims should not be repudiated until the i
Finance Committee had hud time to InVes- j
tigate them. Holbrook took the same j
view, ana IJrandenstein moved that course :
as a substitute to Stafford's motion, and |
it was so ordered.
Fire WardeU Dougherty appeared before
the board and delivered the ultimatum of
the Fire Department with regard to plac- !
ing lire escapes on the school houses. He j
tsaid that all private property owners wore j
being compelled to follow the law, and |
that they wire demanding that public
buildings be also equipped with adequate ;
lire protection. He declared that the Lin
coln Grammar School at Fifth and Mar
ket streets was one of the most danger
ous tire traps In the city and that the :
Sail Francisco Heal Estate Investment
Company; owner of the building, refused
to equip it oil the ground that it was the
duty of the School Department, as lessor,
to do 50. "On 'bfhalf of Ihi Fire Depart
ment he demanded ili^t some immediate
action be taken. The whole matter was
referred to the City and County Attorney.
short leaves of absence were granted to
Miss A. (J. son, Miss J. Parker, Miss
L. R, Culk'n, Miss K. Conklln, Miss J.
Sarles, Miss M. E. Mower, T. K. Kelly
and A. L. Derrick.
The recently deposed heads of depart- â 
ments won their tight for reinstatement,
and President Bergerot offered the reso
lution necessary to recreate their posi
tions. Under the now rule there shall be
no hi ad of department in any High
School unless there are two or more i
teachers employed in such department,
and a minimum of thirty-six recitation ]
hours weekly. In case of the absence of
both principal and vice principal of a
Bchool the department head of largest ex
perience shall act \fi principal. The du
ties of â¢'â¢â¢â  heads of departments shall be
to co-operate with the principal in carry
ing out the plans for the work of the
school; to lay out In detail the work to be
done in their departments for the entire
course; to direct the assistant teachers in
their departments and to report to the
Board of Education such assistants as shall
not prove competent. Heads shall be re
sponsible to their principals for the effi- ;
ciency of the respective departments.
The resignation of Fanny Davies, a i
teacher In the Redding School, was ac- i
cented. â¢
The resignation of G. H. Walker, in
epector. of buildings, was not accepted. |
Directors Armstrong and Holbrook spoke I
in the highest terms of the board's In
spector and urged that he be kept in the
department. Their request resulted in a
unanimous vote.
The salary demands for September
were ordered . paid upon the request of
the Finance Committee.
A life diploma. High School grade, was i
granted to Milton E. Blanchard and a
grammar life diploma was given to Miss
Sarah F. (Joss Grammar grade certifi- !
cates were granted to Miss Hattie K. |
Corlett and Miss May Mac Arthur.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28. 1899.
BERGEROT WAS
SMARTER THAN
HIS CONFRERES
Deceived the Board
of Education.
WHY HE CLOSED THE WEBSTER
RAISED THE SALARIES OF HIS
DEPARTMENT FRIENDS.
â ' â¢ â
; Miss Agnes Manning and Teachers
Roper and Shaw Sacrificed for
Principal Hamilton of the
4 Lincoln Grammar.
: â¦ .
From the inner circle of the Board of
Education it comes that political rather
than sanitary reasons were behind the
recent order of the board closing Webster
I Primary School and turning Its 800 and
I odd pupils loose to . find education in
! whichever of the city's schools room could
I be found, for a class or a fraction of a
â¢ ; class of them.
The reasons were President Bergerot's,
â¢ not the Board of Education's. The reso
i lution which closed the school was offered
i to the board by him and upon his request
' â  and argument was adopted. He gave as
1 j his reasons that the school building had
, 1 been condemned as unsafe by previous
â  Grand Juries, and if such were the case
! it should be closed and its pupils and
' I teachers distributed elsewhere.
The resolution which Bergerot cham
: pioned so warmly was innocent enough on
the face of it, and indicated In no way
its real. intent.
Results which have developed from day
to day have gradually indicated to the
eighteen teachers who were affected
] President Bergerot's actual reasons .for
; condemning the Webster. One of the
; ::rst results was that enough of /the
! eight* classes were sent, as per the
, resolutions, to the Lincoln School to raise
that institution's grade and incidentally
the salary of Principal Hamilton, a
friend of Bergerot, from $173 to $200.
Two of the classes were sent to the Jef
ferson, the rapidly decreasing attendance
at which was endangering its grade. Two
â  more were sent to the \Vhittier, thereby
j putting the principal of that school with
|in Immediate reach of a raise in his
: salary. /
That these were the schools affected
was due to B-?ri?erot's innocent resolution,
which provided that the Webster classes
should be distributed among neighboring
schools. The raises -In grade and.' salaries
i which resulted were .at the expense of
Miss Agnes Manning, Mrs. Roper and
Miss Shaw. Miss Manning was forced on
the annuity roll, and her income reduced
after many valuable years in the de
partment from ?150 to $50 per month. Mrs.
Roper was reduced from $100 to $79 and
| Miss Shaw from $91 to $76. These three
teachers wore as popular as any in the
department, and a quiet but thorough In
vestigation resulted from Bergerot's re
markablt resolution.
It was discovered that the Webster
school was in as good 'condition sanitary
and otherwise as the Lincoln, an.i that
the best evidence of it was the fact that
Miss Katherine Ball and Miss Estelle
Carpenter .ire now nightly Instructing
two classes In drawing and music there,
and both occupy offices In the building.

ARCH BUNKOER
ARLINGTON GETS
LIFE SENTENCE
A Swindler of Women
Gets His Dues.
â # â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Sept. 27.
Arthur Arlington, arch bunkoer and gay
deceiver of unsuspecting women, was to
day sentenced by Superior Judge Hall to
life imprisonment in San Quentin.
The prisoner was convicted of grand
larceny on August 1Â° last in having robbed
Mrs. Minnie M. Smith of $214. after he
had wormed himself into her confidence
by proposing to engage her as his house
keeper. The larceny was committed while
the couple were out at Piedmont Springs
on April 14 last talking the matter over.
â \Vhen the case was called for fixing
sentence to-day Attorney J. E. McElrath
made an extended argument on a motion
for a new trial on the ground that the
court had erred in some material instruc
tions to the Jury.
The motion, however, was denied, and
Judge Hull then pronounced life sentence,
and in doing so said:
"Arlington, you have been imprisoned
twice before for offenses similar to the
one of which you now stand convicted.
For the first offense you were sentenced
to five years' imprisonment, and for the
second ten years. You had not been out
of prison very long the last time until
you repeated "the offense. The object of
punishment is two-fold. First, to reform
the criminal, and secondly, to protect so
ciety. Previous experience has shown
that it is impossible to reform you, no
matter how long the term of imprison
ment, and that you are utterly depraved,
it is the Judgment of this court that you,
Arthur Arlington, be imprisoned In the
State Prison at San Quentih for the term
of your natural life."
The words did not move the convict one
whit. He sat Jtolld and brazen, as was
Ills wont during his last sensational trial.
A writ of probable cause was Blgned by
.ludge Hall and served on Sheriff Rogers,
which will have the effect of keeping Ar
lington in the County Jail until the Su
preme Court can pass upon his appeal,
which will occupy at least four months.
Arlington remarked to fellow prisoners
as he returned to the corridor ut the
County Jail that he was satisfied with
the sentence; In fact, he preferred life
sentence to a sentence of five or ten years,
"because it gives a better chance of win
ning on appeal." as he put It.
The foundation of knowl-
edge must be laid by reading.

! ! 'varsity "baby" team came out ahead
I with a score of 6â o. â ' There was spirted
i playing throughout, and although the
| score rested with the-U. C. freshmen, St.

' equal advantage.
'â  The only scoring was done in the first
j half, soon after the kick-off. Berkeley
' got the. ball, and : with a series of punts
â¢ and short runs worked down toward St.

; touchdown. Both sides indulged in fre
; quent punting, which seldom kept the ball
': ill any one part of the field for very long.
In the second half the freshmen seemed
â â ', to lose their hold, and the honors of the
i playing went to their opponents. Gam

She Stole the Gold.
OAKLAND Sent. 27.â A rnvsteriotiÃ roh-
bery that has puzzled the police for a
couple of days was cleared up to-night
by the confession of a servant girl, who
acknowledged to Detective Holland that
she had committed the theft and had
buried the gold coin and jewelry in a
garden, where it was found.
Two days ago W. E. Thomas, an elderly
Mind man, who lives at -W2O Telegraph
uvenue. missed his store of gold, amount
ing to less than $1W). and a child's sold
watch. He reported the matter to the
police, and after an investigation sus
picion fell on a servant girl employed in
his bouse. She stoutly denied all knowl
edge of the theft, but after working with

confessed that she had taken the coin
and watch and had buried them. Tho

found. There has been no arrest made.
Policemen and Race Horses.
OAKLAND. Sept. 27.â Some members of

frond seeing .their animals compete". There j
is nothing In the rules of the Police De
partment prohibiting a police officer, when

MRS. SIMONS
MAKES FUN OF
HER HUSBAND
I Ridicules His Charge
of Cruelfy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, Sept. 27.
The sensational divorce suit filed by
Anthony Simons yesterday has brought
forth a very clearly worded reply from
Mrs. Simons, who was formerly the widow
of the late Charles Kramm.
"Let Mr. Simons get all through," said
Mrs. Simons to-day, "let him say every
thing he can and will; then I will speak.
Meanwhile I say nothing. I will be very
patient. I can be patient. I can
depend on my friends and neigh
bars to hear everything he can
say and wait until it is my turn. I will
have a good deal to say when my turn
comes. There are two sides to every
story. The public will remember that.
"Cruelty, indeed. As If I wore ever
cruel to him. I was only too kind to him.
This I am sure of. This 1 can prove by
witnesses.
"I can prove It by my servants, if
necessary. I was never cruel to him. I
simply spoiled him with too much kind
ness. Yes, 1 was too kind.
"As for my deserting him, why that
idea is equally ridiculous.
"Instead of desertion on my part, he
deserted me. He did It over and over
again. He acquired the desertion habit.
He deserted me five timesâ the first time
over night, the next time for three nights
and days, the third timo for live days,
the fourth from Monday to Saturday.
Then he went away again, and when he
came back I shut the front door in his
face. What kind ut desertion do you call
thut?
"As for the statement that I shrank
from his going to Europe, that is su
premely absurd. On the contrary, I urged
him to go, and to go alone. He wanted
me to go. too. He actually asked me to
accompany him. Ip to that time no word
had been said about marriage.
"Before he went there was an under
standing, and during his absence we cor
responded. We corresponded in English,
because Mr. Simons, although he speaks
German, does not write it. I was respon
sible for the fact that he visited Germany
and that he went alone.
"I will say nothing about the relations
of Mr. Simons with my sons. In fact I
will say nothing more at present. When
lie has had his say then I will have mine.
Until then I will be patient and trust to
the good opinion and the good sense of my
friends."
When Mrs. Kramm married Simons
some years ago her sons were dissatisfied
and trouble was predicted. The late
Charles Kramm was a generous, whole
snuli (1 niiin and at his death several notes
were outstanding with his political
friends. The holders were being treated
very generously by the widow, but after
her marriage Simons sought to force col
lection in the name of his wife and made
himself very obnoxious in some instances.
The suit for divorce whs not a sururise.
FATE OF AN OAKLAND
APPRENTICE IN DOUBT
OAKLAND, Sept. 27.â Mrs. M. Betancue
of 519 Seventeenth street had a son named
George D. Powers on the gunboat Ur
daneta that was captured and destroyed
by the Filipinos. In his last letter home
he said:
"Our launch" (meaning the Urda
neta) "is manned by a crew from tl c
Oregon and doing special duty. We are
coming home on the Old Lady when she
starts for God's country once more. We
are now doing partol duty in Manila Bay.
Sometimes we help the army out and at
other times we pick 'goo gbos' out of the
river. At present we are taking sound-
Ings 1 along the mouths of all the rivers
emptying in this bay and as soon as the
army can co-operate with us we shall do
some fighting. We were to run the en
trenchments at Orani River, but the army
had not got that far as yet, so we have
postponed the run until the army gcits
there. You see the launches belong to the
army, they having been purchased from
the Spanish . by General Otis."

CITY TELEPHONES
WILL BE REMOVED
Fred Eaton, secretary of the Sunset j
Telephone Company, called upon Auditor i
Wells yesterday to find If there was a
possibility that his company's bills would
be paid if it should maintain until the end
of the year the telephones now In use at
tbe City Hall and in other departments of j
the city government. Auditor Wells in
formed him that there would be a chance â 
of gettiiiK not one cent and advised him
to shut off all phones upon the payment
for which city officials would not stand
personally responsible. Upon this an
nouncement Secretary Eaton served upon
the Auditor official notice that all tele
phones In the service of the city would be I
removed on October 1 unless maintained :
at the individual expense of the users.
The city's teleiTÃone bill amounts to i
something over $12,<XH) each year. Every j
policeman has one In his home, every
Supervisor has one. all of the departments j
at the City Hall have one, and most of :
them from one to three extensions. There I
are others in each county jail and at the
City and County Hospital and the Alms
house and other public institutions. Au
ditor Wells is of the opinion that at least
50 per c^nt of these instruments could be '
dispensed with without hindrance to city i
affairs. The police telephones are not |
used over once a month each, if that, for |
thp purpose of summoning officers to un- \
usual' duty. Most of the Supervisors are in i
business and have telephones of their own !
anyway, and are as well able to pay for 1
them as is the city; and the same applies j
to the members of the Board of Health.
Most of the city officials have not only
telephones, but extensions as well. These
extensions operate instruments on their â 
desks, and while they save overworked j
heads and employes a twenty or thirty !
fool walk to the other side of the office, j
they are not considered by the Auditor !
or any one else as absolute necessities, j
As near as It can be figured, the city's
monthly telephone bill should not be over
$4iio at "the outside, but it is not. and as a j
result even' phone in the hall will be
taken out on October 1.
CHINESE GAMBLERS CAUGHT.
Seventy gamblers were arrested by thÂ« |
Chinatown squad in the rooms of the
Chinese Mutual Protective and Ber evo- j
lent Society last evening. Twelve extra
officers had been added to the squad and
of the five points raided arrests were
made in only one. This was accomplished
by strategy* one of the offi< i ra poking a
long piece or gas pipe, in one i nd ot which
w.i.- Inserted -ms pistol, through a window
in the room and tiring' when the. game
keeper attempted to take the evidence
from the table as the police alarm was
sounded. The sip'.u of the unusually
large weapon so frightened the law-break
ers that they dropped the gambling para
phernalia and made a break for the loors,
only to run into the arms of the police of
ficers. The seventy men were taken to
the California street police station.
MRS. CRAVEN'S PETITION
Nettie R. Craven yesterday filed her
amended petition to set aside the decree
of partial distribution heretofore made
setting aside and distributing all of the
real property of the estate of the late
James G. Fair to his heirs, Theresa A.
Oelrichs, Charles L. Fair -and Virginia
Vanderbtlt. After attacking the author
ity of the court to make the order and
claiming that the constitutional rights of
the petitioner were' violated, it is alleged
that Mrs. Craven was not aware that the
order had been made until August 2 last,
and consequently her neglect to make
application to set aside the order within
the time allowed by law should not bar
her from securing the desired relief. W.
W. Foote, Pence & Pence; Denson. Oat
man and Denson and A. Ruef appear as
Mrs. Craven's counsel.

CONVICT FIENDS TRY
TO GARROTE A GUARD
Ten Men Marked for Slaughter by Felons in
Incorrigible Ward at San Quentin.
"Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper Invents a Cipher Code, in Commu
nicating by Which the Conspiracy Was Made a Possibility.
Warden Breaks the Plotters' Spirits With Straitjackets.
Guard Barwell and Convict Cooper, Who Tried to Oarrote Him.
THREE dopprrate criminals, caged
more securely than wild beasts and
kept under surh strict surveillance
that communication with one an
other v.-.i.Â« dfemrd an Impossibility,
have managvd not only to perfect
the details of a clever conspiracy to es
cape from their cells in the incorrigible
ward at Pan Quentin Prison, but estab
lished a cirhor code used in conversation
that enabled them to talk over their
fiendish plans in the presence of the very
â¢>d to murder without ex
citing the least suspicion. If the scheme
of these plotter* had been carried out
without a hitch, the floor of the old fac
tory building at the penitentiary would
have told the dark tale in crimson let
ters. Two puards were marked for the
hand of the assassin at the outset, and
convicts ultimately regalm d
freedom it is probable that eight
uld have been as ruthlessly
slain.
The first intimation the prison officials
h?d of the conspiracy came when the
made their first move, and the
fact that two of the rineleaders were In
Ftraitjackets until yesterday is wholly
due to their fierce desire to escape caus
em to overleap the bounds of cau
tion. When the details of the affair,
which were not entirely learned by War
den Aguirre and Captain of the Yard Ed
gar until several days after the attempted
break was made, are thoroughly undrr-
Btood it is extremely unlikely that hu
manitarians will murmur any longer
against the incorrigible cell system.
The incorrigible cells are thirty in num
ber and lire situated on the upper floor
of the old factory building. They are in
two rows of flft- â¢â¢ n each and are placed
1 h to hack. In these are kept closely
confined nine of the most desperate and
intractable convicts in the prisonâ George
Bullock, serving a life sentence for mur
der; George -W. Schlegal, undergoing a
life term for train wrecking; Edward Mor
rell, doing a life term for robbery; Alton
H. <;<>uld, serving a long term for burg
lary, and "Sir" Harry Westwood Cooper,
doing three years' time for uttering ficti
tious checks. All these convicts were
placed In the incorrigible ward for being
concerned in the conspiracy to murder
guards and make their escape in last
March. Jacob Oppenheimer, serving a
life sentence for murder, followed them
there for stabbing Guard James McDon
ald. Frank Hunter, doing fifteen years'
time for burglary, followed Oppenheimer
to solitary confinement for being caught
with a concealed weapon in his posses
sion. William I'helan, serving five years
for burglary, went up into the old build
ing for striking another prisoner with a
bobbin in the jute mill. Sing
ng, the last on the list, a Chinese
p<*rving seven years for murder, under
went a similar fate for trying to kill one
of his countrymen as the result of a quar
rel over the division of some opium.
This list of men confined in the incor
rigible cells includes the worst characters
in San Quentin. Morrell is the man who
assisted Bontag (of Sontag and Kvans
fame) to escape from j;UI at Fresno, and
Hunter came near escaping during his first
term by digging a hole through his cell
and the rear wall of the prison. Gould
escaped last year, but was captured.
"Sir" H nrry and Morrell are the ringlead
ers in the plot to escape this time, and
while the former declares that Oppen
heimer was also concerned in the plans,
Warden Aguirre Is so doubtful of the
truth of his statements that he has not
<-. en tit to place Oppenheimer in a stralt-
jacket.
Last Saturday evening .at supper time,
when only Guard Harwell was on duty,
was the time chosen for the break. It is
tho custom for two men to be together
when a prisoner is let out of his cell for
Â« xercise, one standf^g at each end of the
Tier, while the convict walks up and down
between them. For this reason the plan
: lÂ«e carried into execution only when
ono of the guards was absent, and supper
time was chosen because then only one
man would be on guard at a time, they
relieving each other at meals.
While Barwell was pacing back and
forth "Sir" Harry Cooper called him to
his cell door, and stood waiting for the
d with his hands carelessly stuck
ffh the grating of his cell door.
Barwell walked close to the cell, when,
q lick as a Hash, Cooper threw a stout
cord around his neck. Jerked the guard's
head against the door and, throwing his
full weight upon the cord, attempted to
garrote him. As the cord fell round his
neck Harwell threw his hand up and
caught hold of it, perhaps owing his life
to toe Quickness of his action. Bracing
himself against the doorway, he exerted
all his strength and tore loose from the
murderous convfct'fl clutches, carrying
thr> cord with him.
Warden Aguirre was immediately noti
fied, and he went to the cells, in com
pany with Captain Edgar, and questioned
Cooper as to the meaning of his conduct.
Not satisfied that ho was hearing the
truth, the Warden ordered Cooper placed
in a Ftraitjacket. At the end of a day the
prisoner begged for mercy, but was kept
I two days longer, in order to thoroughly
i crush his spirit. At the expiration of
that time he told Aguirre a tale of intend
ed escape an.d assassination so terrible
that even the veteran Captain Edgar was
amazed.
"My intention, "said Cooper," was to gar
rote Harwell and do it in eueh a way that
when his dead body would be close enough
j to the cell for me to reach through and
take the key to the cell from his pocket.
Then I would have let myself out and un
locked the doors of the other cells. We
would have hid the body of Barwell and
â¢laid' for Jones and killed him when ho
returned from supper. Then we would
have waited until it was dark and waited
our chance to silence Sergeant of the
Night Watch Ellis and his seven men. As
they are scattered all over the yard, nine
of us could have accomplished this with
out much trouble. Morrell and Oppen
heimer were in the scheme with me and
j we felt sure that whrn the two guards
were out of the way the others would join
us Then we could have turned a big lot
of the other fellows loose and the whole
gang of us would have slipped over the
wall and escaped in the darkness.
"Those pistols that were supposed to be
in the prison last March are here now.
Morrell is the only man that knows where
they are buried and he promised to sup
ply "us with them when we were free."
Cooper admitted to both the officials
that he had lied about the former con
spiracy all the way through, even to the
Prison Directors. He confessed that
Viilrre's methods of dealing with con
victs were too severe to be stood when
they persisted in breaking the rules, and
! with tears in his eyes confessed that for
' the first time his spirit was crushed and
that "he had enough." In forming their
plans he asserted that Oppenheimer. Mor
rell and he had communicated with one
another by means of a cipher system, the
documentary key of which was furnished
Aguirre Each letter was represented by
a number, and by omitting the letter J
it was made impossible for the uninitiated
to make the least sense out of what was
said. Whole sentences were communi
cated by gently tapping on the sides of
the cell, while a conversation was carried
on at other times by singing the numbers
to a popular air, as if the singer wore
using figures instead of words for the
very novelty of the thing. Some time ago
Cooper asked for a Bible, which was given
him. He finally tired of reading it and by
a strange coincidence another prisoner
wanted it when Cooper cared for it no
I longer. So thoroughly was Cooper's spir.it
broken that he showed the Warden that
he and Morrell had even communicated
by marking passages in this sacred
volume in accordance with their cipher.
The ruthless spirit of the convicts so far
as regards the shedding of human blood
iis shown by the following letter, sur-
I rendered by Cooper to the Warden:
Friend Harry: In saying Sunday the best
time to work on I did nut moan to lnler it is
1 the only day. We must take the best that
comes bo for (God's) Bake bring her to a head
:as soon as possible. When does his medicine
j run out **ââ
Also he hinted that (15x14) would get none
the worse of things from him (ahem!'.)
Come in out of forest.
Bo you now see how things ptand as well
as I doâ hence my warning last night to you.
(25) gave me to understand yesterday you
would have a different demeanor on you be
fore long, also I think from what he said some
of the Boys would go after the Uuard meet,
â¢ also 1 think (G) will be included in the Bach.
In regard to (25) none of us can get at him,
as he does not let any of us out after supper
and before that you know it would be simply
absurd to attempt it, let me hear from you.
ED.
The number 25 refers to Guard Jones,
and the letter G to Schlegal. Morrell de
â  nied writing this letter, but when he gave
| the Warden a sample of his handwriting
iit was identical, and he was at once
thrown into a straightjacket. His spirit
I was broken as badly as was Cooper's at
; the end of three days, and he admitted
1 everything except that he knew where
: the pistols are hidden. A convict whose
name cannot be mentioned for fear that
: the others will kill him for "peaching"
j has told Aguirre and Edgar that he held
j three of the pistols in his har.d, but does
I not know where they are hidden. Oppen
! heimer was not punished because the only
evidence against him is Cooper's word,
and Warden Aguirre says that is "as good
as a vacuum."
"This attempted outbreak and plan to
i commit murder by these convicts," said
Warden Aguirre, "shows clearly that the
sympathy for them held by certain well
meaning but mistaken people is simply
â¢ wasted. These men are too dangerous to
I be permitted to mix with the main body of
j prisoners, and are kept in the incorrigible
I ward not so much for punishment as for
I the general welfare of the prison. They
are not ill-treated. They occupy the cen
ter of a large, airy room with six windows
on each side, and are exercised every
other day. They get two meals a day,
a bath every two weeks and a change of
underclothing every week. They are per
mitted reading matter that has the 'O. X.'
: of the chaplain, and when they want any
thing have only to send me a letter. If
| their desire is reasonable they get it. The
THE SAN FK AN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1899.
I directors visit the cells once a month and
I inspect them at their pleasure.
"Despite this decent treatment they plan
nothing but escape and murder. However.
Cooper's and Morrell' s spirits are thor-
I oughly broken for the first time, and I
: anticipate little trouble from them in the
â  future. I am convinced pistols are plant
ed in the prison yard, and will have the
guards search for them whenever they
are not busy at something else."

When trie juice which is pressed from
grapes for wine-making ferments, the acid of
the fruit is crystallized and precipitated. This
is collected, refined to absolute purity, and
ground to a powder. This is cream of tartar.
Fruit acids are among the most whole-
some and important constituents of the food
of man. They are absolutely requisite to
maintain health. In grape cream of tartar
there are combined the most useful of leaven-
ing agencies and a most healthful food article.
This highly refined acid of the grape, or
cream of tartar, is the material from which
Royal Baking Powder is made. It is many
times more expensive than ingredients used in
many baking powders, but being healthful m
itself, it adds healthfulness to the food instead
of degrading it.
In imitation baking powders poisonous alum
is used instead of healthful cream of tartar.
Such powders seriously affect the health.
LAW SAYS THEY
MUST LABOR IF
THE Y WANT PAY
Quarantine Officers
Meet Defeat.
DR. O'BRIEN'S CONTENTION
SIGNING OF A PERMIT WAS
SUFFICIENT WORK.
In Future When Vessels Arrive From
Foreign Ports They Must Be
Boarded or Allowed to
Land Free.
In future when quarantine officers of
the local Board of Health are anxious
to collect fees from incoming vessels hail
ing from foreign ports "for services ren
dered" they will render the services be
fore presenting their bill. Judge Seawell
of the Superior Court decided yesterday
that the dignity of the position does not
entitle a quarantine officer to demand pay
for nothing, and hence the frequenter of
the water front may hereafter see the
honest sweat of labor dampen the brow
of one or more of these dignitariesâ the
sweat caused by the exertion of sur
mounting the deck of some ocean trav
eler and then looking wise before giving
official permission to dock and discharge
passengers and cargo.
This decision was reached in the ac
tion of Health and Quarantine Officer A.
P. O'Brien against Welch & Co., owners
of the vessel R. P. Rithet. The Rithet
sailed into port after an uneventful voy
age from Honolulu. She was boarded by
Dr. Rosenau of the Federal quarantine
.service, and that official issued a certifi
cate, in regular form, showing the Rithet
to carry a clean bill of health. Some time
later, but before the vessel had discharged
either passengers or cargo, Dr. Chalmers,
the local quarantine otticer, through the
agency of Dr. O'Brien, issued a permit
entitling the vessel to dock. For this ser
vice he demanded $7 50 under section 3020
of the Political Code, but his bill was re
pudiated and the vessel discharged not
withstanding.
Dr. O'Brien forthwith filed suit against
the owners of the vessel to recover his
fee and the action was assigned to Judge
Seawell for trial. Various defenses were
set up by the defendant, it being claimed
that the provision of the code under
which the action to collect the fee was
brought was unconstitutional, for the rea
son that it intended to impose a tonnage
tax within the meaning of section 10, ar
ticle I of the constitution of the United
States, and although Judge Seawell does
not see fit to determine this question, he
holds that the contention of the defend
ants is sound as the payment of the fee
was only commanded when services had
actually been rendered.
Leaving the law for a time, the court
finds that Dr. O'Brien rendered no ser
vice save the labor involved in signing
the permit, which was hardly worth the
sum demanded, $7 50. As to this point
Judge Seawell Bays: "As the fee charged
can only be Justified upon the theory of
a compensation for services rendered, it
cannot be recovered where there has been
DO service. Judgment is hence entered
for dfendants."
As to the contention that the issuance
of a certificate from the Federal 'officers
is sufficient in itself the court says is not
worthy of decision In this case, The mere
fact that no Bervice was rendered by the
plaintiff was sufficient to sustain the posi
tion of the defei dant, and other points,
although having no direct bearing on the
controversy at Bar, but which would have
been of great interest to the public at
large, were not decided by the court.

REPUBLICANS COMMEND
HORACE DAVIS FOR MAYOR
His Acceptance May Be Signi
fied to the Caucus To-Night
Vast Importance of the Municipal Election
Discussed in a Conference of Lead-
ing Men at the Palace Hotel.
HORACE DAVIS, PROBABLE NOMINEE FOR MAYOR.
AN important conference of pro- j
gressive business men of the Re
publican party took place at the
Palace Hotel yesterday forenoon, ]
Among those participating in the
conference were: Charles Holbrook.
Will H. Crocker, M. H. Hecht, Horace
Davis. Henry T. Scott, P. Lllienthal,
Senator George C. Perkins. Colonel Wil
liam Macdonald, C. W. Slack, Zenas U.
Dodge, Sheldon <3. Kellogg and others.
A sentiment was expressed in favor of
placing Horace Davis at the head of the
Republican municipal ticket for Mayor of
the city and â nominating eighteen first
class men of known character and ability
for the Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Davis did not signify a desire for
public honors, but when his associates
reviewed the municipal situation and
clearly demonstrated the necessity of
starting out right under the new charter
he was impressed with the force of their
suggestions. It was the sense of the meet
ing that the Republican nominee should
be a conservative, upright man of busi
ness attainments, experience and execu
tive abilities. To-night the delegates to
the Republican convention who were
elected under the auspices of the Cential
Republican League will held a caucus at
I B'nai B'rith Hall. It is believed that the {
' friends of Horact Davis will have Ills |
permission this evening to place his name i
before the caucus for Mayor.
Horace Davis is a Republican leader
I whose ability is not doubted and whose
i record in a long career of public service
!is without a blemish. He served one term
| in Congress, representing the San Fran
j Cisco district, with much honor to the
â  State and credit to himself. For a long
I time previous to the election the district
was regarded as hopelessly Democratic,
! but Mr. Davis, having the confidence of
' the people, defeated for re-election W. A.
i Piper, his Democratic opponent. Subse
quently Horace Davis was appointed
president of the University of California
and admirably served that institution of
learning. He .acquired such eminence in
| public life that President Harrison dis- \
I cussed the advisability of calling him to
j the Cabinet, but unfortunately the leading
Republicans of California could not agree !
j among themselves, and the Cabinet ap-
I pointment went to another State.
The discussion at the conference yes- i
! terday was earnest and patriotic. The
: point was advanced that the future pros- ,
I perity of San Francisco depended largely '
! upon the character of the city govern- i
I ment for the next two years.
i National topics were introduced and the
hope was expressed that a party com
mitted to free silver propensities and en
tertaining sympathy for anarchists of the
Altgeld type should not gain control of
San Francisco under the new charter, and |
hold the reins of local power in 1900.
Suggestion was made that the affairs j
of San Francisco should be administered
by conservative and broad minded busi- i
ness men of good principles, who would !
not juggle with vital interests for the
sake of catching votes.
The utmost confidence was manifested "
in the ability of Republicans to achieve
success in the coming election. After the
adjournment of the conference a leading !
citizen who attended remarked: '
"If the men mentioned for the Board
of Supervisors will serve the people can '
rest assured of good government. The
election of such men would inspire con
fidence and induce the investment of
money in permanent improvements and
enterprises of great value. It would mean
a new era of prosperity in San Francisco.
I am confident of Republican success.
When the plain facts are presented, so
that every voter may clearly understand
the importance of the election, the peo
ple will repudiate the politicians and get
in line for good government."
There was a meeting of chairmen of
Republican district delegations at the
Grand Hotel last evening. Eleven dele
gations chosen at the late 'primary elec
tion under the auspices of the Central Re
publican League were represented.
The meeting was called to arrange pre
liminaries for the caucus to-night and to
secure candidates whose names halve been
mentioned for the Supervisorial ticket, j
Sixteen men who have been indorsed or |
commended by district delegates attended
the session.
It is understood that candidates for of- !
flee will be admitted to-night to a room
in B'nai B'rith Hall, adjoining the hall
where the caucus is to be held. Every
candidate whose name shall be placed
before the delegates will be expected to
contribute $10 to a convention fund. This
rule applies to all candidates on the ticket
and is not limited to Supervisors.
It is said that John Lackmann will be i
put forward by the caucus for Assessor '
although he prefers the nomination for i
Sheriff.
Reception to Their Pastors.
A reception will be tendered Rev. John
A. B. Wilson, pastor of the Howard M.
E. Church, and his assistant, Rev W
