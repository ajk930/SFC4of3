There have not been wanting signs that
thÂ« Boors regard Ladysmlth as. a very ,
hard nut to crack â i>erhaps too hard for ,
them. Then General Buller's concentra

the drawing off of some of the beseiglng

Although there is the Cape Town rumor
that fighting was proceeding all day Mon
day in the direction of Modder River we
are still without further definite news of
Lord Methuen's â¢ advance. . He is con
fronted with a very powerful Boer force,

which are only about sixty miles from
Gran Pan and Belmont. Besides, It is
more than .probable that a considerable
body of men has been moved from Lady
smith across the Free State to Jacoba
dahl.
The Boer* will make most desperate ef
forts to crush the Klmberley reMef force.
In military circles, however, there exists
a firm belief that the skill, general dis- j
cipline and braver] of the troop* Ml) ex
tricate them from their difficult position
and inflict a crushing defeat upon the
Boers.
While the firing heard on Monday might |
be from a great battle. it Is more likely to
be an artillery reconnoissance. No doubt
the enemy's trenhces will be thoroughly
bombarded before they are attacked.
General Methuen la likely to clear his
flank and rear before he commits himself
to-a pitched battle with Cronje'i com
mandos.
Gatacro's detailed explanation of his
reverse, as given out by the War Office,
last evening, has caused considerable as
tonishment and evoked -chary criticism.
He said that the operation, which ended
in lamentable failure, seemed to promise
certain success, but the distance was un
derestimated by both himself and the lo
cal guides. It v.. ...-us incomprehensible
that a general should not be supplied with
good maps, and yet there in hardly an
other explanation. That the palpable
moral of the Franco-German war in this
respect should have been overlooked
comes with a shock. In that death strug- ;
gle the French officers could not obtain !
mapq of their frontier provinces, while
the Germans knew almost every road and
lane between the Rhine and Paris.
It Is lamentable that this disaster should
have occurred on British coil because tho
British commander underestimated, the >
distance between his camp and that of I
the Boers. The fact that General Gatacrc
himself had not reconnoitered the Boers*
position was evidently due to his weak
ness In cavalry, which prevented a recon-
BOlsaaaea in any force, such as would
compel the Boers to. unmask their artil
lery.
One result of the reverse is the growing
conviction that the strength of the Boers
has been underestimated: that In all dl
rections the British are confronted by su
perior numbers, and that it is the duty of
the nation and the Government to rush
out more reinforcements.
The last units of the Sixth Dlvison em

urged that the Seventh Division should

MYSTERY NO LONGER
CLOUDS REED'S WILL
"Alvira Alice Reed," the Child
Heiress, Was His Daughter.
He Supported the Mother and His Off
spring for Seven Years and at His
Death Made Amends.
MRS. GARCIA. THE STORY OF'WHOSE
I. IFF. HAS JUST COME TO LIGHT
THROUGH THE " MYSTERY "
CLAUSE IN CAPITALIST REED'S
WILL.
THF.RE Is no further mystery in con
nection with the last testament of
the late John J. Reed, the Marin
County capitalist and pioneer, who
surprised his relatives and friends by do
vlslng valuable property to a child named
In his will as "Elvira Cora do Garcia."
The real name of the little heiress, who is
now 7 years of age. Is "Alvlra Alice
Rood." and that of the mother. Frances
Cora Wood. It Is the old story of the
wiles of the man of wealth and of hi*
success with women: a plain tale of he
trayal, the stated facts of which make It
extremely culpable.
Frances Cora Wood was an orphan, who
was reared by Mrs. Carmellta Boyle of
Mill Valley, a sister of Mr. Reed. The de
ceased capitalist had known his victim
from childhood and watched her grow
Into a handsome, attractive woman. He
was in fact a foster uncle to her. Through
his Influence with the young woman he
succeeded In accomplishing her ruin. This
occurred about eight years ago. hut after
the woman's downfall their intimate re
lations ceased. The man was honorable
enough, however, to provide a comfort
able living for the woman and his off
spring.
It Is stated that the family of Mr. R*ed
did not know of his deviation from tne
path of rectitude and that th< y gained
their knowleritje through th<Â» reading of
the will. It is further asserted that owing
to the circumstances under which the
capitalist disposed of his estate there will
be no contest. He deeded the bulk of his
property to his Immediate heirs on the
21st of N'ovomb'-r last, and on the i'th 'f
the same month he wrote the will in
which amehda were made t-> hit allegi 1

Five .lays later Mr. Reed died, and if
the will Is attacked on the ground of un

part of the dead man's property was dis
shows that General French has apparent

acre's defeat. General French reports
that his artillery December 11 forced an
advance post of the Boers south of Eolc3
burg to evacuate Its position and seek
refugo behind Vaalkop.
There Is great indignation In Great
Britain at the ignorance the British in
telligence department Is displaying In
estimating the Boer strength in Cape

ONE DEMOCRAT HEARD
AGAINST FREE COINAGE
Driggs of New York Speaks in Support of
the Republican Financial Bill
in the House.
-WASHINGTON', Dec 12. -There is such
great, pressure, for time .on the part
of the members of both Bides who desiro
to participate in the currency debate in
the House that night sessions were or
dered to-day. Interest in the debate Is.
not Ueen. Judged by the attendance in tho
galleries, although the members them
selves are listening attentively to the
speeches.
Only Â«ne Democrat thus far has spoken
in favor of the billâ Driggs of New York,
who announced to-day that he had
pledged himself before election to support
the gold' standard and proposed to re
doom that, pledge, lie will be joined by
several of big Brooklyn colleagues and
probably several others.
The features of the debate to-day were
the speeches of Qroovoaor of Ohio tor
the bill and of Cochran of Missouri and
Newlands of Nevada against It. The other
ppeakers were Parker or New Jersey, Wil
liam Alden Smith of Michigan, Prince of
Illinois, Lawrence of Massachusetts and
Powers of Vermont for the bill and Shal
roth of Colorado and Sims of Tennessee
against It.
In opening Grosvenor said he had hoped
tho Democrats would meet the Issue

Here with the same old stale battle-cry of
"lfi to 1." Going back to the plattorm
declaration of 1&Â«&, Grosvenor produced a
poll of the members of the comruilteu on

REGULATION OF
RAILWAY RATES
- WASHINGTON", Dec 12.â Senator Cul
lom to-day Introduced In " the Senate a'
comprehensive bill for an amendment of
the law creating the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The bill is in most respects
similar to the Cullom bill of " the last
Congress, and for the same purpose, but
it has been changed in several minor par
ticulars. The main features of the pro
posed measure are as follows: ..-â¢
The commission is authorized, alter
hearing a case, to make an order 'direct-
Ing the carrier to desist from the violation
found and also to prescribe in such order
the thing which the carrier is required to
do or not to do for the future to bring
itself into conformity with the act, and in
so. doing the commission la given power
I to fix maximum rates; to tix both a maxi
mum and minimum rat. or differential
In rates when necessary to prevent dis
crimination; to determine the division;? of
I a joint rate between connecting carriers,
! and the terms and conditions .under
which business shall be -exchanged when
necessary to the enforcement of tho Â«Â»ct;
to make changes In. classification and to
I amend the rules and regulations under
! which traffic is moved. â¢ â¢ â â¢ â¢
The commission now has no power in
Bny cape to fix rates for future observance
by railroad companies. ....... t â¢
The bill makes the order of the coin
' mission effective within the time speciiloJ.
Which ordinarily shall be not less than
thirty days. Any carrier ma"y within
thirty days begin proceedings In the
United States Circuit Court fur a review
of the order. Either party may appeal
directly to the Supreme Court, ana the
case is to have precedence in Jhe courts.
If the court upholds the order, or if the <
order becomes effective otherwise, . the
carrier must obey It or be subject to a
forfeiture of 16000 for each offense and for
I every day It continues In default... If ad
ditional evidence is found necessary In
court, the court must direct the commis
sion to take it and make a suplemental
report. The orders of the commission
I now are not effective until it brings suit
1 In the court to enforce them, and the de
lays Involved frequently extend over a
â  period of years. -. â¢
The bill also further provides . that the
commission shall make and establish a
uniform classification. ThÂ« long and
short haul clause Is made an absolute
; prohibition except upon leave granted by
til. commission. penalties are pr â - |
video! against carriers .In case of â¢â  de- j
parture from the published â  rate. The i
imprisonment feature is eliminated, from !
the act, and shippers are not liable for
offense except false billing or other fraud- |
ulent practice. a forfeiture is Imposed
upon carriers for .failure to â¢ file annual
reports before September M of each year.
The commission is authorized to prescribe
the form of accounts and to Inspect the
, books of carriers and â  it may employ
special agents or examiners who shall
have authority, under the order of- the
commission, to inspect and examine such
accounts. 'â¢ .... . .â¢ .

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.â The Roberts
investigating committee -resumed its ses
sion today .behind: closed doors:. This; it
..was explained, was to permit the comm't-
tee to receive and discuss reports on pro
cedure, form of subpena, etc. Meantime
Roberts himself and a gathering of Mor
mons and gentiles stood outside the com
mittee door awaiting admission.-*; Roberts
was prepared to continue his argument on
the demurrer to the right. of th,6 commit
tee to try ' him. The gentile. delegation
was non numerous, including th?.white
haired Rev. Dr. I lift Bchroeatv, to whom
Roberts Interposed rather sensational ob-
Jec'.ions on Saturday, and the others who
have come on from Utah to direct' the pro
ceeedings against him. .. f- '..
The committee remained in private ses
sion until noon, when an adjournment was
taken until 10 o'clock to-morrow, when
the actual hearing of witnesses will begin.
Roberts saw Tayler as soon as the com'
mittee adjourned and submitted. his brief.
Roberts' brief is a lengthy legal argu
m. ni iigainst the rlglits of the commit
tee. !!<â¢ urgÂ« a that the constitution gives
tlon aKaiiisi trial without the pro
i law; also against taking property,
BUCII ;is tli.-- .-alary ol ;m office, without
due process of law. Huberts' summary
Is as follows:
From the'foreKolnÃ established doctrines and
rights of, members of Congress it follow*:
â That the proi>oÃe<l proceedings of this com
mittee would be tsubvereive â -; the rights of .the
member from Utah.
1. .That he l* to be adjudged guilty of crime
without due procaii of law.
2. Th.it he la to be ailjudeed disqualified by

but not itjiiillcable to th. State of Utah, which
Jisabllitieti have been removed (a) by amnesties
of- i'rej<lflpnth: ib) by tho enabling act
passed by Cnner^Hs; (c) by the transition of
Utah ff'tii the territorial condition to that of
statehood.
â  3. It further appears that the crime alleged
acanlst the repiÂ«Â«Â«ntÂ«tlv< from Utah does not
constitute a <j|(-<iuahn" at; >n for a member of
nbnjETMs, unless the House an.l its committee
are prepared to' assert their power and right
to mm to the qualifications prescribed by the
Constitution of the Unite i Stated.
4. Arvl ( urt her, -the prt'i"ff,Â»Hl proceedings by
this committee would deprive the member from
Vtah of th.^ constitutional right to trial by ,i
court of nimpotent Jurisdiction Â»nd by a Jury
of his peers within the State and district where
the crime lÂ« alleged to have been committed
and would deprive him of property and rights
without due process of law. The member from
Utah, therefore; auks the committee to etop Its ;

COGHLAN SAYS HE
MADE NO PROMISES
SEATTLE. Dec. 12 -Captain J. B. Cogh
lan, commander of the United States
cruiser Raleigh during the recent Span
ish engagement, has been since August
last commandant at the Port Orchard
naval station, a few miles from â¢Seattle.
When Â»een to-day by the Call's corre
spondent he Â»as %t first reluctant to
give any expression concerning the
statement recently made at Manila by
Colonel Julio dpi Rfo, a -Spanish officer,
and Senor Rafael RoselUv a merchant.
They allege that the Spanish surrender at
Ollngapoa. In Subijc Bay, was made upon
tho- express promise of Captain Coghlan
that the Spaniards should not be deliv
ered to the insurgents. Captain Coghlan
states that hIS official ' report furnished
the department at Washington tells a dif
ferent, but more correct story.
"Why." said the captain, "it's ridiculous
talking of our having made any concee
sions; there was absolutely no necessity
for a<ny. I was ordered to capture the
Island, and didn't lose any time in doing
It. Soon after we began to bombard Olin
gapoa the white flag was raised. I sent
an officer ashore and Immediate and un
conditional surrender was made to him.
We took, I think. 63T> prisoners, more than
that number of Remington rifles, a quan- ;
tity of ammunition, pistols, swords and
several cannon. I did noi go ashore and
never saw Colonel del Rio, Senor Ro
.Â«ello or any of the prteoncpl other than
through my glass from the ship. In con
sequence. I could give them no personal
assurance as to their future, neither did I
empower my officer to make any stipula
tions and never heard of him so doing.
In consequence there was no violation of
any agreement and I cannot see how any
claim for damages against the United
StateÃ could possibly hold."
Captain Coghlan seems to think that
the eighteen months' imprisonment of the
tnlkntlve Spaniards has had the effect of j
almost entirely obliterating their recollec
tion of the actual occurrences upon the
occasion In controversy. The captain
adde.l:
"Instead of salllnp away on the evening
of the 7th and leaving the garrison prac
tically unarmed, an.l permitting the in
surgents to frequently lire upon the town,
we simply m/>vo.l about three miles out in
the bay antf anchored. We were always
in view of the town., with our searchlight
playing upvu it. We had pot then taken
the arms of the Spaniards, and I had noti
fied the Insurgents' commander that he
must not interfere, and my instructions
were obeyed. When I was ordered to
place the prisoners on board the Insurgent |
boat Fillpinas it was done on jhe morning
of the stlu by my men and In our small
boats. No assurances whatever were given
the prisoner* as to their caxe or dlspoai
tion. We didn't have to."
i aptaln Coghlan states that he never
reported that the German crul.-er Irene
slipped her cable upon the appearance of
the Raleigh and Concord in Subig Bay,
although some such rumor gained clrcula- i
tfOtt He further HtfttM that the Raleigh
was in a position to prevent the prisouers ;
from being molested, and until all had !
been taken from the island the Insurgents i
were not permitted to land.

CONVENTION OF THE STATE FRUIT GROWERS.
cured In frult-ralslng and thÂ« Industry i
fostered, but there were many things yet
to learn. The Bureau of Agriculture and
State Department of Agriculture had
aided greatly. The handling of fruits
must be considered. Markets were not
satisfactory. Something was wrong.
There mas a plethora of money, but
prices w;re not light. The remedy lay In
co-operation. Transportation was an
other subject to be considered. Railroad
rates wera-one degree below prohibition.
Some plan must be devised to do away
with cold storage and co-operation must
be re-sorted to to bring down rates, but
little could be expected from the Nica
ragua canal. Congressional action was so
slow. There must be a strong co-opera
tion and 'all the frultmen must work Cor
one common purpose. He denounced the
Jamaica treaty.
President Ellwood Cooper read his nn
nual address, which In part was as fol
lows:
This will be the twenty-fourth Btate Fruit
Grower*' Convention and the twentieth held
under the auspices of the State Board of Hor

tlculture. In 1892 the convention met In this i
city. Many rhinffi have taken place since I
that time. There ha* been much discourage- :
ment to fruitgrowers by reason of the financial
â¢imurbanceg and the Insufficient rainfall dur
ing- the j.ast three years, but notwithstanding
lhe d raw backs, great advances have been made 1
t iward solving the most Important questions I
that concern the fruit problems. Radical '
â¢.â¢hang.es must, of necessity, be slow, because j
the creat body of people In any vocation are
critical and cautious of new methods or any ]
deviation from old-tlmÂ» customs. New condi
tions require new modes to meet them To be
successful we must adapt our methods to the
necessity that confronts uÂ».
The greatest difficulty we have to overcome
Is a proper distribution of our fruits. This
quebtlon has been discussed at every conven
tion for the past fifteen years. At our last
meeting I recommended that agents, selected
fr->m among our fruit growers, or those con
\ersant with our fruit Interests, be empl-iyeil
to travel through the different sections where
fruli can be sold arrange with responsible mer
cantile houses to sell the fruits, to fix the
prices, to hold meetings where It may be nec
er?axy and exhibit to a certain extent what we
have for Â»alÂ». give Information how to cook
the dried fruits by distributing the bulletin of
Professor Child* as published by the board a
few years ago; In other words, to educate the
people In what is to their interest, as well as to
determine the quantity that each market will
take at a fair price to the producers. To ar
range central houses In all the large markets
so as to prevent overstocking or decreased
prices. To be successful we must control the
sales and manage our own prodacts. These
agents could work In the Interests of our every
product. A small per cent of the commissions
paid would bÂ« sufficient to meet the expense;
such a plan would give us better railroad facil
ities; competition among the common car
riers would ensure the best possible terms and
the beat time In transit, and all rebates would
! com* to the producers.
Inn McLaren. In giving his Impressions of
American character, formed on a recent visit
to the United Slates, speaks of a shadow on
American public life. The money-getting spirit
predominates, and ail men, with few excep
tions, bow the knee to the golden calf. The
lack of a high state of commercial honor seri
ously affects the public mind, and where it will
end the future alone can determine. It is the
universal opinion among fruit growers that the
best success can only be obtained by co-opera
tion, unity and concentration, and yet It has
been staled In public discussion by Intelligent
fruitgrowers that they were convinced that con
centration was Impossible. Why? There can
be only one conclusion- that Is a want of con
fidence either In our ability to sell our own
l.nxlucts. or a distrust of fair dealing by those
trusted with the management. Y<?t while we
distrust each other we trust people whom we
have never seen, and who manage our products
and gYow rich by our Industry and labor. Com
binations are not always formed for the best
interests of the producers. A close examination
will discover e|thÂ»r a grent lack of business
tact or create a doubt as to the strict honesty
of thÂ« rmnasrer*.
The report then referred to the organi
zation of the Walnut Growers' Associa
tion of Southern California. The associa
tions combined and fixed prices for last
year's crop. Previous to that each associ
ation fixed Its own prices. The plan of the
Walnut Association was detailed. Presi
dent Cooper 6tated he was pleased with
': the plan of the Fresno Raisin Growers'
Association.
The subject of Insect pests was treated
at length. It has received the attention
of all conventions. Great advance had
been made In combating the destructive
enemies. The San Jose scale, which
twenty years ago played terrible havoc.
Ib scarcely known to-day. I>ater the
Isyrea Purchasle. or white scale, threat
ened the citrus Industry In Southern Cali
fornia; to-day there Is not a citrus grow
er that fears the enemy. Thon the black
â eal* and purple scale were noted. It
was stated that reports from Hawaii
were to the effect that the purple scale
ha? been destroyed by a ladybug.
An agent was sent to the Islands to pro
cure colonies of this ladybug to be distri
buted In the Infected districts. Only a
few specimens could be obtained and the
problem had to be solved by propagating
the specimens sent here.
Te referred to an address made years
, ago at Fresno, In which It was urged
that a sufficient appropriation be made
and special bureaus be established as
l>art of the State Board of Horticulture
for Investigation of predaceous Inserts
and parasites. Recently a worm, like the
army worm, has been destroying alfalfa
fields by thousands of acres in the Middle
West; also of the attack on beetflelds. It
Is possible that the worm may reach here
and cause great loss to the sugar beet
Industry and also to alfalfa fields of the.
San Joaquln Valley.
Codlln moth Is probably more generally
distributed through the L'nited States
than any other fruit pest, and no doubt
. causes greater loss than any other post.
In many places the. growing of apples and
pears has been abandoned on account of
Ft. yet not a dollar has been appropriated
to Investigate or to search for a possible
i enemy to keep It In check.
The report continued:
When nature plants a forest ehÂ« makes no
mistakes. Sho plants thÂ« right trees In the
right place: flowers, animals, bulbous root*,
flowering shrubs and vines all flourish tn thÂ«lr
beauty and grandeur. No enemies. Insects or
brute animals materially disturb It, at lÂ»ast
until Invaded by man. If we wish to succeed
we must follow rature and maintain the utno
balance as created.
The Stale board has available 57500 to be
1 spent In tlie search for the enemies of the
' destroyers of our fruits. WÂ« have an aÂ«rr.t.
Qapfgl Cumpere. now traveling with Albert
X â¢bet*, who Is In the service of the Hawaiian
â  Government. Compere had been heard from
iat Suva. FIJI, on October 19 last He had
made sever*! discoveries, and I am very hopÂ«>
: ful that some Important finds will bÂ« the re
sult of his trip It Is the Intention of the
I president, providing the other Commlsi>!iin*rÂ«
i ajrreÂ« to It, to mind Com[>ei> to Southern
Europe to search for the parirtte of the cod
; lln moth. It has been an*ert<>d that tn South
ern France, where the codlin moth Is always
present. It ha* been kept In check by Its
natural enemy. This Information was pub
lished by the State Board nearly twenty years
I ago.
Food adulteration was touched on but
, as It was on the programme, for dlscus
! aion the president stated he would not Â»o
1 Into it fully. He had hoped for legislation
to protect the producer*, but no relief had
yet been secured. The combination of
1 capital interested In this dishonest and
profitable business seems to be too great.
j He said representatives of Eastern agrl
l cultural collaarfts had reported that there
had been discovered a rock In North Caro
lina that was ground Into powder to mix
with wheat flour and that whole train
loads had been shipped from North Caro
lina to adulterate flour. There does not
appear to be anything that escapes adul
teration or being tampered with by swind
ler?.
The supply of water would be discussed
on the Moor and a great deal would be
learned from the experience of others.
President Cooper nad not changed his
views on railroads In seven years and re
ferred to his report of that time.
He urged the protection of forests. lie
said it was very gratifying to know that
our Government Is being rapidly educated
up to this subject. Several tracts had
recently been reserved. Their destruction
would reduce the water supply. The
pasturing of sheep and cattle is destroy
ing the young growth of bush.?* and
trees. If this Is allowed to continue God
only knows what will be the result to the
â valleys below. In former years It required
from live to six Inches of rainfall to make
flood water and which usually ran clear.
Now one or two inches of heavy rain
comes down in floods, bringing mud and
sand, and it runs off and flows into the
ocean. Twice as much rain falls in the
mountains as In the valleys. The thicket
preserves this rainfall and fortifies the
mountain streams, which give us water
during the summer and fall months.
I recommend that this convention pass reso
lutions asking Congress to pats an act with
drawing from settlement for homes all the
mountain lands not r<"cupled In the Stata of
California, and restricting the devastation
caused by prospecting for mineral wealth and
fcr mining purposes.
The Agricultural Department has reoently
taken great Interest In the culture of the < It
ron. It Is brought Into the United States and
pickled and processed here so as to avoid Im
port duty. The department has made arrange
ments to Drocet>s our product both In New
York and Chicago, and they ask for shipments
of not less than 100 pounds of the California
varieties so. as to ascertain If It Is equal to
the foreign product, and establish the ratal
of the product for us.
The Quarantine Officer will make a report
of the work of his department.
The president's address was referred to
a committee consisting of J. R. Lewis. of
San Jose. w. P. Cragen of San Jose and
Henry Stabler of Tuba.
Alfred Barston was appointed assistant
secretary.
Professor Chllds stated that an effort
would be made during the convention to
organize the prune growers of Santa Clara
fes'sor Childs stated that an effort
1 be made during the convention to
ilze the prune growers of Santa Clara
Valley. To-morrow he will read a paper
on the subject and give the true status
of affairs.
Edward Berwick of Monterey County
stated that he would make a report at
the afternoon session regarding the work
of the committee in securing reports of
foreign fruit markets from the United
States Consuls. . â 
The subject of the codlln moth' was
brought up and discussed. Some half
dozen remedies were suggested. The dis
cussion became general. The paris green
solution was ventilated, Professor wood
worth of Berkeley. Edward Berwick and
I others participating.
Horticultural Commissioner Dakin of
Santa Cruz spoke of his success with a
moth cellar, wnera the affected apples had
been placed. One season from 4000 to 5000
moths had been destroyed.
Mr. Motheral of Kings County spoke
of bats in the foothills of Kings County
! that destroyed the codlln moths. This
i brought on a full discussion of the bat
question. Secretary Lelong stated had
I thoroughly investigated it. At the Hatch
; ranch, near Biggs, he killed 200 bats and
; examined them, but had failed to find the
i least trace of the moths In their stomachs.
There were also advocates of the burlap
I band around trees as being able to collect
I the moths, when they could be destroyed.
Mr. Cutler of Sacramento stated that
the law had been Invoked In his county
to rid the infested orchards of the pest.
The owners had refused to spray and they

Assistant Secretary Barstow read the
report of H. Welnstock. the president
and general manager of the Fruit Grow
ers* and Shippers" Association, on the sea
son's operations of the organization. It is
I as follows:
The importance of widely distributing Cali
fornia fruits In the largest number of Eastern
markets and avoiding gluts in a few large cen-
I ters seems to be keenly appreciated by growers
and shippers, as evidenced by the larger ship
ments this year to smaller markets, and the
opening of new â¢ markets In Interior placesâ
which In the report, are grouped under the
heading "minor points"â thus, in the Interest
of the grower, preventing the gluts so common
before the creation of this association. The
consignments to foreign: markets have also
greatly Increasedâ from forty-two cam shipped
by rail In IS3Â« to England alone- to 124 cars In
18J9. shipped to England. Scotland, Germany
and' Mexico. , *
I In the early spring It was the opinion of the
best Informed growers and shippers that the
largest yield of fruit California ever produced
would be harvested this year, but the lav frost,
wind and rain proved dlsaKtrous'to the cherries
and apricot*, and the early rains and unfavor
able conditions to the grapes. The shipments of
peaches, however, were double that of any year
since 1894. The shipment of plums and prunes
Increased 63 per cent over last year. The ship
ment of apples decreased nearly 10 per cent,
I while the shipment of â¢ pears during the past
I four year* has varied but slightly. The total
shipments of 1899 exceed those of 1898 by ISO
carsâ an increase of S7 per cent.
The California Fruit Gorwes' and Shipper*
Association has continued to successfully carry
on the work delegated to It by the growers as
sembled In convention In ISM. maintaining
union auction rooms at each Eastern auction
point, free and open to all buyers, thus getting
all thÂ« buyers and all the fruit under one roof
at one time, and thereby securing the very
highest market price for the fruit. The bureau
of Information has continued the publication
of the dally bulletin, giving In tabulated form
the report of the railroad companies, of the
dally Eastern fruit shipments and the destina
tion of the cars. While the bulletin Is not ail
that could be desired, and It can hardly be
hoped that It can be made perfect, yet it has,
even In Its imperfect state, proved of great
value to the grower and shipper, by giving
them approximate Information of the daJl>
shipments, the varieties of fruit going forward
and the date of their probable arrival In the
Eastern markets. Since the Issuance of the
daily bulletin, the glutting of Eastern markets
has been of rare occurrence, of short duration
and attributable solely to local causes. "
Edward Berwick made an oral report
on the Nicaragua canal. He stated thÂ«
work was still dragging along. The canal |
was necessary. The Government Is still
making- surveys of the muchly surveyed
canal. He advised strong co-operation
and wanted all to use their Influence with
our Senator and Congressmen to work for
thÂ© canal. The report wu received and
the committee continued.
Mr. Berwick also reported for thÂ« com
mittee on securing market report! from
United States Consuls abroad. He told
of the difficulty he had had. and of the
many short and curt replies he had re
ceived from the office of the Secretary of
State. His persistent efforts had been re
warded, however, and now there were â .
prospects of the matter being attended to.
Secretary Wilson had notllied Mr. Ber
wick that if he would only Just state what
he wanted the request would surely bo
granted. The report was received and the
committee continued.
The committee on organization, trana
portatif#i etc.. reported through Its chair
man. R. 1). Stephens. It follows:
The committee met Immediately after the
recess taken by the convention and organized
by the election of Alexander Gordon of Fresno
as chairman and H. P. Stabler tif Yuba City
as secretary.
Several gentlemen appeared before the com
mittee with plans for organization, which
plans were considered In detail by the com
mute*.
Resolved. That we advise the immediate or
ganization of a Fruit Urovrer*' Association *,t
Northern California. The purposes of :hlÂ» or
ganization shall be to establlrl. a car line or
any other method of securing transportation
relief and to facilitate the profitable marketing
of oui fresh and dried deciduous fruit.
The report was adopted and the committee
was constituted as follows: W. R. Fountain,

The committee organized by electing K. L
Stephens chairman. F. C. Nlles secretary ana
E. A. Galvln treasurer. ".
The committee Immediately entered upon the
discharge of the duty for which It was created,
find after thorough consideration unanimously
adopted the following plan: The executive
committee chosen by the recent convention of
fruit growers of California to perfect such a
plan of organization as should result In pro
moting their best Interests and securing their
release from the prevent method of fruit trans
ition and marketing that threatens to In
volve them In disastrous loss. If not financial
ruin has given most careful if not financial
has given most careful consideration to
the whole subject and has reached this unani
mous conclusion: , .
Firstâ That the fruit growers organize ror
mutual protection.
Second-That the fruit growers form a cor
poration for the purpose of owning and operat
ing a refrigerator car line.
Third-That the fruit growers organize for
the purpose of marketing their fruits and fruit
ll Fourth-In doing which they will be allowed
the utmost liberty In the disposal of their
fruit, either by selling for spot cash at land-
InK point, through our own representatives In
the large cities or through Messrs. Porter cr

per designates.
For the purpose of organizing the growers

The failure to perfect an organization of the
The failure to perfect an organization or tne
growers may be attributed to the following:
Apathy on the part of some, who permitted
others to think for them. *
Jealousy on the part of others, who fear that
tholr neighbors may be more benefited through
the organization than themselves.
Dissension among growers caused by differ
ence of opinion as to how to proceed In organ
izing and upon what plan.
Intimidation controls the actions of many,
who are given to understand that any action
on their part to In any way aid the movement
being made to organize might result In mate
rially Impairing their personal Interests.
Crop mortgages prevent Independent action
on the part of the mortgagees.
Concession made to growers In the way of
rebate on commissions, so much per package,
or In any way that would be satisfactory to the
parties Interested.
Selfishness on the part of many who desire to
sell to one or the other of the great commis
sion and shipping organizations, the opportu
nity for which was offered through the agita
tion being made In favor of organizing the
growers for the purpose of marketing {heir
products.
Such men would say: "Tou are all right; go
ahead; we are with you. but we have a lot of
fruit we wish to sell f. o. b , and are now ne
gotiating to that end. When we have sold we
will be with you heart and soul and do all we
can to aid In building up an organization that
will better protect their Interests than has been
done In the pact. In the meantime, however,
do not for the world abandon the effort to
bring about a perfect and complete organiza
tion of the State."
A report was also . read from Mr.
Stephens, showing the negotiations that
had been conducted between the commit
tee and the railroad in regard to the es
tablishment of a line of refrigerator car*.
The matter was discussed very little,
and then went over till to-morrow morn-
Ing for discussion.
The rest of the afternoon was given up
to discussion. Able remarks were made
by Judge Lewis on thÂ« Nicaragua canal.
He said the work should be demanded,
and In Its completion he saw the salva
tion of the Pacific Coast and especially
the fruit interests.
The following resolutions regarding the
Nicaragua canal were adopted:
Whereas, A half century has already been de
voted .to a succession of surveys by various
commissions, without any decisive steps being
taken toward actual construction, and
Whereas The Nicaragua Canal Commission,
headed by Admiral Walker, has reported favor
ably as to the entire feasibility of such con
struction, at a reasonable outlay, and
Whereas. The prosperity of the whole agricul
tural and horticultural Interests of the Pacific
Coast Involving many millions of dollars annu
ally, depends In the future on improved trans
portation facilities, therefore be It
Resolved. That this convention of thÂ» fruit
ADVERTISEMENTS.
FOR WELL PEOPLE.
An Easy Way to Keep Well.
It Is easy to keep well If we would only
observe each day a few simple rules of
health.
The. all Important thing is to keep the
stomach right, and to do this It is not
necessary to diet or to follow a set rule
or bill of fare. Such pampering simply
makes a capricious appetite and a feeling
that certain favorite articles of food must
be avoided.
Professor Wiechold gives pretty good
advice on this subject. He says: "I am
68 years old and have never had a se-
rious Illness, and at the name time my
life has been largely an Indoor one, but
I early discovered that the way to keep
healthy was to keep a healthy stomach,
not by eating bran crackers or dieting of
any sort; on the contrary. I always eat
what my appetite craves, but for the past
eight years I have made It a dally prac-
tice to take one or two of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets after each meal and I at-
tribute my robust health for a man of
my age to the regular daily use of Stu-
art's Tablets.
"My physician first advised me to use
them because he said they were perfectly
harmless and were not a secret patent
medicine, but contained only the natural
digestives, peptones and diastase, and af-
ter using them a few weeks I haVe never
ceased to thank him for his advice.
"1 honestly believe the habit of taking
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after meals Is
the real health habit, because their use
brings health to the sick and ailing and
preserves health to the well and strong."
Men and women past DO years of age
! need a safe digestive after meals to In-
sure a perfect digestion and to ward off
disease, and the safest, best known nnd
most Widely used Is Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets.
They are found In every well regulated
household from Maine to California and
in Great Britain and Australia are rap-
Idly pushing their way, Into popular fa-
vor.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, full sized packages at 60 cents,
and for a weak stomach a 50-cent pack-
age will often do fifty dollars' worth of

save Morphy from his fate, but the law took Its course
Santiago Morphy. or "Mexican Murphy." as he was called, became a
well-known character at the local racetrack last winter. His betting opera
tions were quite heavy, although it Is surmised that when here he had re
maining but a small portion of the $70,000 he is alleged to have embezzled in
Mexico. Morphy claimed to have lost considerable money. Jewelry and
clothing in the Baldwin Hotel fire. He made numerous friends among horse
men. When he was arrested by detectives In New Orleans, several friends
came to his assistance and succeeded In kidnaping him from the officers He
remained in hiding for a time, but was eventually recaptured. Morphy was
regarded as a "pretty square" sort of a fellow, and many <>f the acquaint
ances he made here were loth to believe the charges against him.

the Congress of the United States to proceed

Professor Childs spoke of the unorgan
ized state of prune growers of Santa

John Markeley or Sonoma spoke along
the same line. He said co-operation and
organization were the only remedies. *
Alexander Gordon of Fresno spoke of

CHECKS LAND FRAUDS
IN THE OIL DISTRICTS
WASHINGTON,' Dec. 12.âRepresenta
tive Needham to-day called on the Con*
mlssloner of the Land Office to more ef
fectually stop alleged frauds In Tiettln*
titles to oil lands in San Joaquln Vail': .
in addition to the order heretofore made
withdrawing from entry lands which have
been described in letters and telegrams.
Mr. Needham succeeded In getting tho
department to issue another order requir
ing the locators of these lands, who are
attempting to get title thereto with forest
reserve script, to publish notice of their
location in the nearest newspaper, and
also requiring such locators to aftlrxna*
lively prove that lands so taken are ag
ricultural In their character, and not min
eral. The department will hold that th!Â»
order is retroactive. This order will placu
the burden upon the script men of prov
ing that these lands are agricultural
rather than mineral, and under this order
this must be done after the publishing
of the notice.
Mr. Needham contends that this order
and the holding of It to be retroactive
effectually puts a stop to these alleged
frauds, and he feels greatly elated. Th*
land lawyers here In Washington who
represent script men are violently pro
testing, but Mr. Needham feels assured
that the order will not be revoked.

GATHERING
OF LEAGUE
MAGNATES
â 
KETO YORK. Dec 12. -To-day marked
the beginning of the annual winter meet
ing of thu N. .!!'â :. al "ball LeapruÂ« at
the Ft f tli Avenue Hotel. Armed for an
especially bitter attack the members were
&!1 on hand, but so much â  Be was con
tained by the board of arbitration that
the League only met to carry out the re
</.;r. ::..;.â¢- of the constitution and Im
mediately adjourned.
Not in yearsânot Fince the end of the
famous Brotherhood lightâ has a League
int-t-tinK been fraught with sÂ»o much im
portance as the one Just begun. For
wetks pafct there has been no end of lob
bying and wirepulling iunonc the \ - arlous
cluh owners for the avowed purpose of
reducing the circuit and purifying the
t.ntlonul game.
Several of th(* minor league teams were
represented to-day. It is not believed
probabla that the proposed scheme for a
reduction in the League circuit will go
through. The situation as summed up by
one of the I'asK-bail men to-night was to
this tffect:
"I.Â«oul.*\ ille and Cleveland will sell on
Fair terms. Wanner wants big money for
l:iÂ« franchise in Washington and the
Hrooklyn-ltaltimore syndicate* wants the
earth i<t the Oriole franchise. \\ no Is
iroing to put up all this moneyâ the
league? Will. I hope not."
For more than five hours to-day the
members Â«>x the national board of arbitra
tion argued ;tÂ« to the merits of the SVrig
l>y controversy, in which the Now York,
Kronklyu and Syracuse clubs are in
volved. At the conclusion of the confer
i nee It was announced that a resolution
had been adopted declaring that the Syra
ruse Club had no right to. control A\ rig-
Iry's Â«rrvirÂ«-s after his contract had ter
minated with that club. In a word, the
action of t lie board of arbitration was a
Mow at the minor league clubs, as fills
ruling means that any National league
tlub may take the players of the minor
league club a: the end of their season,
which iÂ» one month earlier than that of
the big league, and try them out without
paying any money consideration to the
rliib to which the player Is under reserve.
Yht* fÂ«ct that thÂ« minor league clubs may
t>e dickering with -another club for the
tale of th* player makes no difference.

NEW ORLEANS. Dec. 12.â The decision

' many thinking that Trillo had won. The

I gained so fast, however, that within a few
I yards of the wire Mitchell started to ride
| again. Prince Biases finished on the In
; Bide and Trillo on t)u> outside of the track
j and the Judges placed the former first.
i The stewards to-day suspended a. J.
Wallace, owner and trainer of the horse
George I^ee, pending an investigation of
; the running of the horse on December 9
, and 12. Jockey Shepard. who rode the
horse in those races, was suspended under
similar conditions. The weather was fine

ROBINSON SAYS HE
IS A GOOD THING
WOULD NOT PROSECUTE WOMEN
HE HAD ARRESTED.
Made His Money Er.sy at Manila and
Slew It in on One Hot Old
Time.
Charles S. Robinson, late of Manila, re
fused yesterday morning In the Police
Court to prosecute the women, Mrs. Mad
eline Allison and -Mi.-. May Burns, whom
he had caused to be arrested the night be
foro on charges of grand larceny. Judge
Treadwell discharged them from custody,
only a little the worse for their few hours
in the City Prison.
Robinson admitted that It was probably
his own fault that the women had found
him such â  Rood thing. He arrived at the
Palace Hotel one day last week after a
prosperous year as a merchant at Ma
nila, his mind made up to have a hot time
in the old town. He confided his Inten
tion to a friend, who Immediately took
him to call on Mrs. Burns at her flat. S2UB
Geary street. There they met a friend of
hern, Mrs. Allison, and the four got along
famously. Nest morning Robinson drew
$1000 from the bank, and hunting up the
Indies got them to believe they needed
new dresses. To a downtown store they
went, and before Robinson knew it he was
going down in his inside pocket to foot
the Mil for a dress ordered by each of his
companions, the bill footing 1315.
Nothing would do Robinson then but
champagne and the races. Once at Tan
foran he turned over |T>oo to the ladles,
who managed, so they told him. to piaco
In on losers. He sent a large part of the
balance of hiÂ» $1000 on the champagne
route without a murmur till he found on
his way home only the feeblest kind of
Jingle in his pocket. Then he became BUS
picious that he had been "worked." ll*
rode with the women into the city before
causing their arrest on their refusal to
return to him the money he accused them
of having held out.
Mrs. Burns was released on bonds at
2:30 o'clock in the morning, but Mrs. Alll-
Bon remained In prison all night. On the
announcement of Robinson that he would
not prosecute they were discharged,
whereupon they pot their money and val
uables from .the property clerk and van
ished out of Robinson's life.

MARIE MILLE WAS GRIEVED.
Tells Her Story in the Tanner Mur
der Trial.
The trial of George 1,. Tanner for the
murder of James Brown and Fannie
Barnes was continued before Judge
Dunne yesterday. Louis Mille and nis
wife, Marie, who keep the house In which
the tragedy occurred, told their story to
the Jury. Both said that they were called
after the shots had been fired, and Mrs.
Mllle ?aldÂ»that Phe was greatly grieved
as she liked her tenants. Neither thrÂ«Â«w
any light on the cause of the tragedy. The
case goes on to-day.
Publishing: Probate Notices.
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down a decision which Is of no small in
terest, especially to every Judge and
every newspaper published In the State.
These are the circumstances:
After admitting to probate the will of
Augustine Smith, deceased. Judge Law of
the Superior Court of Merced County
ordered that Lillian M. Brouse, execu
trix, publish notice to creditors in the
Merced Express. The lady protected on
the ground that the court had no jurisdic
tion to designate the paper that the no
tice should be published In. The court
refused to grant a writ of review of the
mutter and she appealed to the Supremo
Court. The higher court upholds her po-
Bltion. saying: "The publication of this
retire Â»Â« n function which the statute de.
Clares shall be performed by the executor
..i administrator." The power of a court
to designate the newspaper In which such
notices shall be published Is only where
no newspaper Is published In the county.
The order of the lower court was ordered
modified by omitting the name of the
paper.. . . . â :-â â¢â 
KNOCKOUTS
THE PORTION
OF BOXERS
Three Bouts End Suddenly at
San Francisco Athletic
Club.
The gymnasium of the Ban Francisco
Athletk- Club was filled to the bursting
point laÂ»t night, the occasion being the
regular boxing exhibition of the club. Of
the four bouts two lasted but two rounds
each; <<ne went a short distance into the
third round, and the other went the limit
of eight rounds.
Hud Terry and Jules Tillman. a brace :
of feather-weights, were the rtrst in the
rlnp. The first round was given over to '
friiitlriK tactics, and there was little to :
chooM between the style of the two
youngsters. Terry showed to advantage
for a tew moments, when Tillman rushed |
him to the ropes, landing right and left. ,
This dazed his opponent, and another ,
blow put him out of the competition.
Toby Irvine and Jerry Collins were the
next to appear, litfore the second round
was over Collins wa.- too dazed to con
l tlnue and was counted out. Irvine had a
quick left jolt, which Collins could not
avoid. Collins was knocked down once
and was only well on his feet when he
was sent down again to remain the fatal
; ten seconds.
The bout between Charles Rochette and
j Charles Fredericks went the limit, the de
' ctsion going to Rochette. After the first
three rounds Fredericks could have posed
for a statue of the tired boxer. Rochette's
sharp, stmgii.tj blows cut both hlB eyes,
while blooa trickled from a number of
I small wounds. Notwithstanding his loss
I of blood he was gume tv the end and took
ian unnecessary amount of punishment.
He was knocked down repeatedly, but
ip on the aggrewlve. Rochette was
sever in danger alter the tlrst round,
which was in Fredericks favor.
The bout between Henry L*wis and J.
J. Â«Jlppert lasted but a sh^rt time Into the
1 third round, when Gippert went down on
Ills face with a crash and was counted '
out. He was larger than Ix'wis and was .
Strong, but slow and awkward. He could
I not get away from Lewis' left swing. In
the second round he lost his head and !
landed at will. The bell saved him, I
' but he went only a short distance Into the
third round when the end came.
KID PARKER FAVORITE.
Betting has commenced In earnest on
the boxing bout between Kid Parker of
Denver and Rufe Turner of Stockton. As
was expected. Parker is favorite at odfls
qf 10 to 8. It 1b expected there will be a
lot of money wagered at about those odds,
us each man has a strong following. This
Is Indicated by the fact that the largest
' number of tickets soid in the mutuels call
I for Turner. According to this the nmal!
I bettors are playing their dollars on the !
K'lored buy from Stockton. His clever
showing with Jimmy Kellly and again
with Sammy Maxwoli ha* impresned them â¢
with the idea that he will be a hard man
to beat.
The waÃering on the meeting of Cole
and KichiÂ«- has not commenced. It is ex- i
: th>- force of money placed by the
racetrack contingent will make Richie fa
| vorlte.
Kane Wins From Dooley.
CRIPI'I-K CREEK. Colo* Deft 12 âKid .
Dootoy (colored i of Denver was knocked
out in the twelfth round to-night by Jack '
Kane <>f San Francisco. The battle was
hotly contested throughout. Dooley wan
game, but succumbed to the terrible left
arm swings of his opponent. In the.
twelfth round Kane knocked Dooley down
f>.ur times. The knockout blow waa a left |
; swing on the Jaw. '

WHERE STORMS ARE MADE.
Petition to Re-establish thÂ« Tatoosh
Island Station.
Some time ago th. Government abol
ished the signal Station on Tatoosh Isl
and.' near the coast off Cape Flattery,
Wash. This has caused no little Incon
venience to the shipping men of the ooa-u.
for as one. of them expressed It, that Is
the place where they scare up all of the
big storms of the Pacific coast. The sta
tion was abandoned because of the cable
frequently breaking between the Island
and the mainland, where it connected
with the coast line. Owing to the Island
being so far out In the ocean the oppor
tunity for noting the approach of bad
weather Is much better than anywhere
along the coast, and the shipping men are
very desirous of having the station re
opened. To this end a number requested
the local Chamber of Commerce to take
action and have the Pacific Coast Repre
sentatives urge the authorities at Wash
ington to reopen the station. This was.
discussed at length yesterday at the
meeting of the trustees, and every effort
will be made to have the matter favor
ably considered. Secretary Scott will pre
pare and send a memorial to Congress at
once. . â  â  â¢ . â¢
The matter of obtaining better rates
from the telegraph companies between
this coast and China was referred to a
committee to visit the cable companies.
The demand for better rates cornet* from
the commercial men of this city and those
at Hongkong. A memorial will be sent to
Congress asking that another cable be
laid between Florida and Cuba. Another
petition will he to have the plans for the
drydock at Mare Inland changed and

LOCAL PHASE OF PROBLEM
SERIOUS THEME DISCUSSED BY
PHYSICIANS.
~ â¦ â
A minister prominent In BUÂ«toaa ami
Â«vr%nomio affairs of St. Paul ha* â  run a
controversy that has been carried Into
other lar K e cities of the Union, anil
nrnoTic them San Praneipoo. Neither thÂ«Â»
problem nor Its dlFous^lon Is new. but
thousand* of men and women are lr.ter
eMrd In both. It Is the, old question of
"women as ware-earners and the effect of
manual labor upon American women in
iv.ocr relation to the Â»oo!al. economic,
moral and physical forces of the. nation.
One. particular phase of the controversy.
Ih&t of tho physical a* understood by
phyfiflans. Is of timely local Interest.
In the shops and factories of San Fran
rlsoo many thousands of women recelva
Â«3ally employment. It is lntwestinp.
therefore, to know what prominent local
Physicians think of the present and fu
ture we!l-be:nK of these, women.
The St. Paul controversy has assumed
far wider proportions than this. It Is es
timated that over 4.0.0.000 women are now
uage-earners in th* T'nited States. Folly
45 per cent of the employes in manufac
tories are women, and It Is c!a!med that
thÂ« percentage Is increasing year by year.
It Ix asserted that modern conditions of
facial and Industrial life are driving men
rut .if employment to Rive plar* to women
Â«.t loner w.'ik^h p_nd harder and more ex
acting conditions of labor.
The drudgery of thÂ« shop and thÂ« fac
tory, it Is contended, has fallen to woman,
oc-troylng her social life, injuring hrr
morally, physic-ally and mentally, creating
prt'-at Â«-e<>nÂ»milc and social disturbances
and dooming the nation to a future race
of ....,*.;:. :_Â«. produced Inevitably by
vomen physically unfit for motherhood.
The Pu Paul clergyman Insists that we
Â«r* In the m'dst of a new savagery
which Is immeasurably, worse than that
which marked woman aj> a menial and a
plave. Our shops and our factories are
draining the lives of our women, devour
ing ihÂ«Mr poPFible strength and trans
forming thu mother into a beast of bur
den.
That the problem Is a scrlnus one thrre
ran he nn question. It has been agitated
times without nurat'T and will be apaln.
The vlvws rt thÂ« Su Paul mlnistor are
not by any means. hnwÂ»>\-pr, the views of
I'romin^nt physician's of thlx city. They
ax* far from p^clnif the dlr<Â» effectii of
manual labor upon women as seen by the
clergyman. He Is an extremist, they
tay. and Is bettor qualified perhaps to
rilscuss the ethical and .moral phases of
th<* problem than the physical.

manual labor for women is an unqu.illJu-d
evil. "I am afraid." be said yest. rdny,
"that our St. Paul clergyman la an ox
tremist. Thera is not the slightest doubt
that some kinds of manual labor an ut
terly unfit for women, as In rigar fac
tories, for example, but it la absurd to
contend that all manual labor Is an evil
to women- Much of tne work thai they
do now In chops and factories is undoubt
edly injurious to them, and nothing too
pevere In condemnation can be said of It.
Hut the evil is In the environment. In the
conditions which surround women at
work.
"The neglect of snnltary laws and of

TTTE PAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1899.
LETTER THAT SHOWS
ST. LOUIS PROGRAMME
HAS TO FIGHT FOR TRADE IN
HOME FIF.I.D.
Middle West City Meets With Local
Illustration of Tendency Con
cerning' Shipments by
Carloads.
Jobbers nnd manufacturers In this city
are in receipt of a circular letter that has
come to light over the signature of A. J.
Vallandlngham. commissioner of the St.
Louis Freight Bureau. This was ad
dressed to the hardware, agricultural and
vehicle interests by Mr. Vallandingham.
Therein he called upon the interests men
tioned to protest against the proposed
chances In freight classification by rail
road lines east of the Mississippi River
and north of the Ohio. In his letter Mr
Vallandlngham included a tabulated
statement of the proposed changes which
applied to agricultural implements and
something over forty other articles.
The point In the matter, as indicated
by this tabulation, is that the roads In
Mr. Vnllandlngham's territory will leave
practically unchanged the classification
upon carloads, but will advance the class
ification one notch on all the articles in
the list on less than carloads.
Mr. Vallandingham addressed himself to
his follower! forcibly to advise them to
protest against the limit that the new
classification mad- upon the Jobbing trade
of St. Louis. "Unless," wrote he. "this
movement is checked, the Jobbing trade
of St. Louis will be limited to â  very small
territory and manufacturing trade will be
carload only."
This indicates, according to the Jobbers
of San Francisco, that St. Louis, while
trying to grab the Jobbing trade of the
Pacilic Coast and appropriate the Pacific
Coast territory, is very much frightened
by neighbors who may act just as the
jobbers are acting In regard to this coast.
The move of the railroads referred to in
the Vallandingham letter also "Illustrates
the tendency of the railroads all over the
country to discriminate in favor of the
carload as against the less than carload,
because the carload is handled by The
roads with 1. ss trouble than the less than
carloads, Two paragraphs from Mr. Val
landlngham's letter are as foil m
"The following changes in ofllclal class
ification are row contemplated by lines
east of the Mississippi River and north
of the Ohio. If made In that territory,
they will be followed went of the Mis
sissippi River by similar advances. Many
advances have already been made by
withdrawing commodity rates. If these
changes are made as proposed, rates on
many commodities will be higher than at
any time In the past twelve years or more.
If made In railroad classification. the rail
roads will at once begin a movement to
have the State classifications also ad
vanced."
TEA SAMPLES GO TO
NEW YORK EXAMINER
ORDER STANDS DESPITE THE
PROTEST MADE.
Fear Locally Entertained That Other
Moves May Follow to Disad
vantage of This Port.
The local tea Importers have been In
formed that samples of all teas brought
to this port from a foreign country are
now sent regularly to the tea examiner at
New York. The protest that, was sent
forward when the Treasury Department
Issued the order for such action has al
ready been mentioned. But notwithstand
ing the protest the order has stood to this
time. The local tea Importers have set
forth that It would bo Just. If .samples of
tea passed upon by the examiner here
v.- â â¢ to l>e sont to New York, that sam
ples examined at New York ought also to
, be sent here for Inspection. No tea ex
aminer under the law has any power over
any other man of his cla*s. Nevertheless
1 the discrimination shown In the sample
matter Is held by importers to indicate
1 that New York has made a point as
against Baa Francisco.
Samples have not been received, here
from either New York. Jjhlcago, Tacoma
or St. Paul, which are the lour places
outside of Ban Francisco where there are
tea examiners employed by the United
States. What tho indications threaten Is
a move to follow the present one that may
result disastrously to the tea Importers
of this port.
"Now York has been losing trade," said
a tea Importer yesterday. "That city
therefore naturally reaches out for all
that she can get. The New York mer
chants see the promise that there is In
the future of San Francisco under exist
ing conditions and fear that here is a
rival in the tea Importing trade. The pur
pose is undoubtedly to force tea ship
ments away from Ban Francisco and
through '*> Suez canal. Taking Inspection
of teas â â â - a matter apart from any other,
the unfairness will appear on the surface.
The plea Is that uniformity Is sought. ThÂ«
tea examiner at this port and those at the
other ports outside of New York possess
the requisite skill to pass upon teas prop
erly. If education is the only purpose of
! the move It would be well to pass the edu-
I cation around and lei the examiner at
San Francisco see the Judgments of all
Other tea Importing ports. The proposi
; tion gives Just cause for question through
' out."

STRONG PROTEST
IN INTEREST OF
EXPORT TRADE
Canadian Lines Will
Be Fostered.
W. Ford Thorn.is. attorney in fact for
J. D. Bpn & Bros. in. and the
i< Steamship Company, Bled yester
wlth Customs Collector Jackson for
transmission to the Secretary of the
â¢ry a protest ap.unst the depart
ment decision <.t November IT of this year
prohibiting the entry for immediate trans
cportatlon In bond of shtp
d â¢â¢nis of merchandise' through the United
Stut.-s for exportation from the- Pacific
Mr. Thomas begins by saying that the
ruling works a decided injury and a tre
mendous loss to the shipping and trans
portation interests of the- domestic ports
of the Pacific because there is a formida
ble competition by steamer from Vancou
ver, K. C. to all the points of the Orient
where steamer connection is made to all
the principal points of Australia and New-
Zealand. He adds: "There has been for
years a rivalry between the ports of San
Francisco and Vancouver and Victoria,
and when the well known fact is taken
into consideration that the Canadian lines
of steamers are granted enormous sub
sidies, which enable them to carry freight
nt a large prolit and gives them by such
granting of subsidies an advantage over
American lines, it seems but natural and
Just that the most liberal construction of
the transportation and export laws should
be given in favor of our own people and
our own port."
Mr Thomas submits that the decision
will also divert shipments from the port
of San Francisco because shippers and
foreign consignees do not wish their pack
ages to be opened and Improperly re
packed. After discussing the legal effect
of the ruling Mr. Thomas adds:
"We claim that when merchandise I*
â hipped from a foreign country and trans
ported In bond through the United States
and exported from a port of the United
states to a foreign country that In such
case the law n^wr contemplated that the
packages should be opened and examined
by the Lnlted States officers, thereby
causing unnecessary delays, decreasing
the value of the goods by Improper re
packing and forcing the shipment of goods
by (port route to the profit of foreign
carriers and foreign ports, which will bo
the result If the decision of the Honorable
Secretary of the Treasury shall stand un
modified."
COUNSEL NEARLY
READY TO ARGUE
FRENNA'S CASE
Few More Witnesses
to Testify.
The defense in the Frenna case intro
duced Its prize bunch of witnesses at the
trial of the alleged murderer yesterday
The attempt to show that Frenna had
been driven temporarily Insane by the
chicanery of Turner was abandoned for
the moment, and the attorneys â¢ for the
accused bent all their efforts toward con
vlnclng the jury that Turner had been
for a year or more thirsting for the blood
of the man who shot him full of h'.l~s
from behind. According to these wit
nesses. Turner spent a large portion of
his time during the last two years voic
ing threats to -Kill the Dago" and take
a fall out of one 1., S. M.-^inson. The*e
threats having been promptly repeated to
Frenna counsel for the defense would
have the jury believe that the slumbers
of the barber had for months preceding
the shooting been disturbed by visions of
a tall, lanky, ferocious-looking man "ex
ecuting a war dance on the footboard of
his bed. brandishing a bowie knife in one
JX^oVllEd?'â¢ '" "- Other a Â»<
The only trouble with the scheme to
enmesh the jury in the self-defense the
ory was ,i... evident fact that almost
every witness who testified to having
heard Turner make these threats had an
old grudge agfUucc the muroereo m"iÂ» a*S
was altogether too eager to clear t V m n
who Blew him. This eagernesa 'cat wed
the witnesses considerable embarrassment
and confusion when they came to be
cross-examined The money-lenders were
well represented among those who came
forward to help clear th,- defendant but
their testimony was of little value
L. 8. Megginson was the mo** nm
nounced of the witnesses who Â£nVdeteÂ£
mined to secure the acquittal of th.? Hi
fendant at all hazards. Megginsori hâ¢
occupied a seat with the couSeTfor tS
defense all during the trial and also visit?
Ed Frenna in the County Jail daily since
the tragedy In the Crocker building both
of these facts belriK brought out in his
cross-examination. He testified that
Turner had met him on the street one day
In 1895. and in the course of the conver
nation said: "I'll kill that Dago â^
: and yet Megginson said a minute later
In response to a question addressed to
â â¢ him by Attorney W. M Cannon on cross
examination, that he had not spoken to
Turner since 1892. Megginson admitted
that he was very bitter toward Turner
for a number of years before the latter' s
death and that he had helped gather evi
dence to prosecute him on previous occa
sions. He became so badly tangled in Ms
statements that his testimony was robbed
of any value to the defense, while his
manner on the stand could hardly have
had a very favorable effect on the jury
Dr. \V. .R. Cool was another - witness
who had trouble with Turner and swore
ho had heard Turner threaten Frenna
He had seen a bowie knife In Turner's of
llce oh one occasion and Turner had told
him ho Intended to use it on Frenna
Cool also became sadly mixed as to his
dates, however. Turner had had him ar
. rested on one occasion.
A. Bernard, who said he was an attor
ney, testified that he Â»aw Frenna a few
days before the shooting. Frenna was
greatly worked up over threats madÂ© by
Turner and threatened to drown himself

SEATING OF BELL A

American Federation of Labor Spend

the Delegate.
DETROIT. Mich.. Dec. 12.â The question
Of the seating Of a single, delegate occu
pied the American Federation of Labor
Convention tho greater part of to-day's
session. The importance of the action to
be taken in tins matter Is In the fact that
by It the federation expects to establish
a precedent either of the strict upholding
of it* constitutional provisions in rHa
tlon to admission of delegates or of 1.-n
lency In seating In Its convention mem
bers of labor organizations not affiliated
with the Federation.
The case In point Is that of W. 11. Bel,
delegate of the Omaha Central Labor Un
lon. who Is president of the Painters' Un
ion in Omaha, which is allied with the
so-called Lafayette faction. Â«ho â  branch
of the craft which has no affiliation with
the federated division, the Brotherhood
of Painters and Decorator! of America,
known as the Baltimore faction. The con
w.ntion adjourned without having reached
an agreement on the Question.
During the afternoon the delegates had
a half hour's diversion listening to Miss
Susan B. Anthony, who made an appeal
to the Federation to join In a petition

AN EXTRfi SESSION. .
Tin every Republican
demand for the frankest publicity of all move
ments pertaining to the calling of an extra
sc^ion.
The Governor, with credit to himself, has made
public the conditions upon which he will issue a
proclamation. Now let the various legislative lead
ers be equally frank and remove their light from un
der the bushel where it is hidden at present. There
is no public impropriety in asking and holding an
extra session of the Legislature, which will fulfill it*
O'r.Mitutional function in the election of a United
States Senator. But we are not aware of any honest
purpose that requires stealth and sinister secrecy.
There will be contention, of course, over the election
of a Senator. The organs of Colonel Bums have
already begun a campaign of falsehood and detrac
tion, but that should not tv.rn the purpose of wise
Republicans to have a Senator choÂ«en who will so
represent the State as to command the respect of the
whole people. The course of those organs simply
rcintroduces them to the public as defiant of public
opinion and destroyers of party harmony.
Our faith is pinned to the strength of the great
masses of the Kcpuhlican party, who do not wish to
make iqoo a campaign of excuse, apology and de
fense.

ODDLY enough Mr. Kasson, American Com

sympathies. He is also an Eastern man. with
bat little knowledge and apparently less sympathy in

the protection of our orange crop. Mr. Kasson
to have made the discovery that the Ja
maica orange comes into market in the early winter
and therefore is not in competition with the California
, orange. If he sought information on that subject he
. would discover that the oranges of California are
seeking a market at every season in which any foreign
! orange appears. The range of orange climate in this
State covers the season of every citrus fruit region in
the world The Porterville. Placer County and Oroville
oranges are early in the market and are followed suc
cessively by our other citrus belts. The early orange
I rone here is of growing importance. Every year adds
to the acreage of orchards north of Tehachapi. The
thermal belt of the foothills, from Tulare County
north to Tehama, has been proved safe from frost

The Call has heretofore shown that oranges grown
on t!ie lands of the county poorhouse in Butte County
bate largely to the support of that institution
and promise loon to lift its burden entirely from the
taxpayers. In that county are some of the largest
and finest commercial orange orchards in the State.
The Jamaica treaty puts all of this in peril. The

While raisins are not directly touched by name, a?

exposed to a harmful wrangle over interpretation and

directly attacked, and our almond* and walnuts are
given away to get a good bargain and profits tor the
East.
As far a* California is concerned it nay be stated
vith emphasis that this treaty destroys every penny
of value there is in protection to this State. Our
r^anufacturers get but little anyway from thr system,
and it has been supported here solely in the interest
:r vast investment of $100,000,000 in horticul
ture.
To increase the gloom of our position the Presi
dent's message recommend; that the terms of the
Jamaica treaty be extended to I'orto Rico and Cuba.
Threatened by coolie iabor in Hawaii and the Phil
ippines, which implies the destruction of our bed
industry, California la-pins to feel the snub
1 that afflicts a stepdaughter in the family of States.
One feature in the situation is novel. Senator Per
kins in a Washington interview is quoted as saying:
'The reciprocity treaties must be accepted or rejected
by the Senate as a whole, and cannot be amended."
If this is the constitutional situation the peril is
grave. Heretofore it lias been held that every treaty
negotiated by the executive and submitted to the
Senate may be returned with amendments by that
which become the subject of further negotia
tion between the contracting parties. Just why these
, moÂ«t important commercial treaties become an ex
ception to this rule is not explained. We trust that
1 the Senator is mistaken and that our interests may be
MTvcd by amendments proposed in the Senate,

the moon. Those heavenly bodies have BoubtleM BO
other duty to perform than that of lighting the niH
niphts of San Francisco and would supply the illumi
nation were it not that fogs in summer and clouds in
winter interfere. As it is there are sixty nights in
the year, an average of five nights a month, when
the streets are turned over to darkness and Egyptian

more lights on the streets. It is a j?ross absurdity
for a city of this size to rely on moonlight for street
illumination, and the absurdity is heightened by the
hct that in this particular city the number of clear
moonlight nights that occur in a year could be
coi-nted on the fingers of one hand. It is high time
that the old way of trusting to the moon for illumina
tion should cease and a new order of things begin.
For that reason there will be a good deal of objec
tion to the Mayor's statement that the lighting of the
past two months has been apparently satisfactory.
A GRATIFYING feature of the campaign now
going on in the interest of municipal improve
ment and progress is the earnest and active
pan which has been taken in it by members of im
provetnent clubs and similar organizations in all parts
of the city. Rarely has any movement in the history
of San Francisco brought into co-operation so many
representative men. Rarely has any considerable
number of business men been so energetic and so
unsparing of time and private interests in any public
undertaking. The whole course of the campaign i=.
in fact, one which the intelligent citizen can watch
with satisfaction, for it abounds with evidences of a
newly awakened spirit of civic patriotism animating
nearly all classes of the people.
Even if the bond issues should be defeated by rea
son of a lack of the necessary two-thirds vote in
their favor the community will profit much by a
canvass of the kind that is now going on. The in
terest in great municipal questions which has been
excited in the popular mind by the various proposals
now submitted to discussion is bound to have a
lasting effect upon local politics. The business men
and the workingmen of the city will hereafter take a
keener interest in municipal affairs. City elections
will be something more than a struggle between rival
bosses and their henchmen, and the intelligence of
the community will give a more earnest study to
local problems and more zealous support to every
veU directed movement to remedy existing abuses
or improve good things to betttr.
There are reasons, however, which justify sanguine
hopes that the benefits of the active canvass now be
ing made by so many gentlemen of light and lead
ing in the community will not be derived by indirec
tion only. The prospects are that every proposition
included in the two elections will be carried, and that
San Francisco will start forth in the new era with a
grtat bound forward along the path of progress. The
only issue upon which much of a fight has been made
is thatjDf park extension, and that is one which ap
peals so strongly to so many classes of people and
assure* Mich wide benefits for all time to come it is
hardly likely the opposition to it can show much
strength at the polls.
San Francisco needs every one of the improve
ments proposed in the issues of the two elections
which have been called. The park extension is as
necessary as the lewers and the hospitals. It is a
measure of public health as well as of civic adorn
ment. It will virtually bring the park down to the
corner of Van Ness avenue and Market street, and
tr.us render it far more accessible than at present.
Fortunately, all the arguments for improvement arc
bring presented strongly and clearly, again and
npain. The opponents of progress may be stubborn,
but the zeal and the energy of the advocates of im
ptovement will overcome their antagonism and ac
complish victory for the city.
THE TROUBLES OF GREAT BRITAIN
WHAT advantage the British Government de
rives from the censorship which supervi ? es.
checks and almost suppresses reports from the
seat of war in South Africa is not clear to the pub
lic, but it is evident the officials deem it to be con
siderable, for they maintain it in the face of a strong
opposition an.l a growing desire and anxiety on the
part of the British people for complete news. In
spite of the censors enough has been made known
to show that the situation is by no means encourag
ing to the hopes of those sanguine imperialists who
expected Bullcr to begin an immediate march on
Pretoria as soon as his corps was disembarked.
It is now two months since the war began, and up
to this time every battle has been fought on British
soil. The first rush of the Boers has been checked,
but it has not been beaten back, and their troops
continue to hold the ground gained in Natal and
Cape Colony. Moreover, it is now evident the dif
ficulties which confront Buller are political as well
as military. There iÂ» danger that the Dutch clement
in the British provinces may rise to assist their kins
men of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State,
and that danger is more serious than any which is
threatened by the Boer armies now in the field. It
is mainly for the purpose of preventing such a rising
that Duller has had to stretch his army across the
whole frontier and move forward by widely scattered
columns instead of by one.
To add to the perplexities of the Government other
dangers threaten the empire. For the purpose of
preventing French enterprises in the valley of the
Nile the British recently arranged a treaty with Italy
which among other things included an alliance
against Abyssinia. It now appears that Menelck re
gards the arrangement as in some measure threaten
ing to himself, and a recent dispatch from Cairo an
nounces that he is cloÂ«?ely watching the progress of
events ij> South Africa, and is strongly inclined to
attack the British forces in the regions around Abys
sinia.
Another portent of evil is seen in the danger of
famine which hangs over a large district of India. It
is fairly certain that considerable sums of money will
have to be expended there in relief work, and. more
over, the discontents which invariably occur among
a people in times of distress may lead to outbreaks
which will require a strong force to subdue. Thus
the British may have wars in Northern Africa and in-
surrections in India to meet if they do not promptly
gain such, victories as will discourage the antagon
isms that are felt against them.
Under these circumstances it is perhaps for political
rather than military reasons the censorship is made
so rigid in the supervision of reports from South
Africa. The Government may deem it better to keep
the British public in suspense than to give out infor
mation of disaster or weakness that would incline the
Dutch of the Cape, the Abyssinians and the discon
tented tribes of India to believe the time has come for
them to strike.
Latest rumors in circulation in London are to the
effect that the War Office is withholding news that
would indicate that the survivors of the Stormberg
fipht owe their safety more to their legs than their
valor. Is it possible that Aguinaldo has swum over to
Soi'th Africa to lead the way for them?
The National Democracy has appointed a press
agent for the coming Presidential campaign. It would
seem to a disinterested observer that the Democracy
will have greater need for a press censor after the
Democratic spell-binders get to work*

FULLY SUSTAINED

RESTRAINING ORDERS ISSUED
AND
ALL INFRINGERS WILL BE PROSECUTED.
The United States Circuit Court of Appeals In Its opfaslOM of p.r mber 7.
1599, finally and fully sustains the Welsbnrh Company's patent: deal >rs and
users and manufacturers are cautioned against infringement of the WHs-

tirely of the preliminary objection that affirmative rtJJcf of this sort will nVÂ»t
be granted to defendant, a question not now passed up^n. thÂ«re seems no
good grounds for criticism of complainant's circular. It states that Judge
Townsend enjoined the 'manufacture and sale* of Infringing mantles, and
he did grant such an Injunction. And this court has enjoined the sale of
mantles which the person enjoined did not himself manufacture, when his
past conduct In the matter of Infringement created a special equity In fa-
vor of the complalntant against him. It is true that the circular goes fur-
ther and threatens suit against persons who sell mantles but who never
have been at all concerned in manufacturing or causing them to be manu-
factured.
"In other words, It threatens suit upon the patent as If It were a patent
for a product. But the complainant Insists that the threat Is made In good
faith; that it intends to bring suits against sellers of the infringing mantles
upon the theory that the patent Is really one for a product. In view of the
peculiar language of the claim, this court is not now prepared to hold that
such contention would be wholly without merit, or that the complainant
could not succeed against a mere seller. Moreover, It Is contended that the
seller of a purchased mantle himself promotes the taking of the final step
in the process, and such contention has not yet been passed upon adversely
to complainant.
"These are questions which should be left to be determined In one of such
s'ults rather than here.
"If complainant Intends to prosecute one or more sellers, and there Is
nothing before the court to induce a disbelief i n Its assertion that It does
bo intend, it would seem to be its proper course to warn dealers to desist
from selling."

STREET CAR MEN
OBJECT TO THE
PROPOSED RATES
Committee Listens to
Secretary Clayton.
Passage of the Proposed Ordinances
Would Mean a Virtual Confisca
tion of Property or Keduced
Wages to Employes.
Secretary Clayton of the San Francisco
and San Mateo Railway was the only rail
way ofllcial who appeared before the Ju
diciary Committee of the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon to argue
against the recommendation for passage
of the two ordinances providing for the
Hale of car tickets to school children at
eight for 25 cents and to workmen at
seven for 25 cents during certain hours of
the day. Mr. Clayton made a forceful
plea In behalf of his company against the
proposed ordinances, and at his request
consideration was postponed until next
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock, writes rep
resentatives of other street car lines will
be given a chance to be heard.
"The passage of these ordinances." said
Mr. Clayton, "means a virtual confisca
tion of the property of the San Mateo
road. It will entail a loss of one-third In
our gross receipt* and will work a hard
ship from which we will not be able to re
cover. If our receipts are cut clown we
could not pay operating expenses. Even
now we are paying no dividends, and we
are certainly entitled to â  reasonable re
turn on our Investment, and the reduction
In fares will prevent this*. The passage
of these ordinances will compel us to re
duce wages to motormen and conductors.
We nay out now 60 per cent of our gross
receipt* In wages."
Mr. Clayton quoted an opinion of for
mer City Attorney Creswell at the time
when ex-Supervisor Clinton presented res
olutions making street car fares I! 1 * cents.
The opinion holds that the Supervisors
have no power to limit the act of January
1, 1878, which provides for the regulation
of street car fares by the State, and hail
no power either expressed or Implied to
pass or enforce the proposed ordinances.
Chairman Bylngton replied to the argu
ments of Mr. Clayton and stated that un
der the act of 1563 the Supervisors were
empowered "to license and regulate hack
ney coaches and other public passenger
vehicles and to fix tho rates to be charged
for the transportation of persons." etc.
Re referred to Los Angeles. Toronto and
other cities which had put Into effect the
reduced fares. In the case of Toronto,
Mr. Clayton said that the street car com
panies there could stand for a reduction
In fares because coal was $1 75 a ton and
wages are IS 2-3 cents and 15 cents an
hour, while here they are 22 cents.

The Best Food
for Infants
Nature planned that infants
should have only milk for at
least the first year of life. But
thin milk, skimmed milk, will
no* nourish. It's the milk that
is rich in cream, or fat, that
docs the work. This is be-
cause fat is positively neces-
sary for the growing body.
Scott's Emulsion
contains the best fat, in the
form of Cod-Liver Oil, for all
delicate children.
They thrive greatly under its use.
Soon they weigh more, eat more,
play better and look better. It's just
the right addition to their regular
food. The hypophosphitcs of lime
and soda in it are necessary to the
growth and formation of bone and
teeth.

Before he could realize the danger there
was a hissing stream which fast flooded
that section of the mine with gas. He
had not time to about more than the first
syllable of a warning when there was a
heavy explosion, and the mangled form of
the mlnÂ»-r was swept along tho tu.inel.
Bernardo Stucee, who was at work near
by. was also killed, his body being found
horribly mutilated when the mine wasÂ« en
tered. His body and that of Jones were
mangled almost beyond recognition.
Thos. were the only two killed, but a
number of others were seriously injured.
Among those who suffered nv>!Â«t were
Howard Tairbln. the foreman of the mine,
whose face is horribly burned; John Guth
rie and his son. John, who were both
maimed by falling coal, and burned, Fred
iAi-sen. John MÂ«thews and Henry
Thompson were seriously burned, and tm â¢
Chinese and two Japanese were injured,
the Japanese perhaps fatally. The heavy
explosion which shook the walls of coal
auaed by the igniting of the gas re
leased by the subsidence of the rouf and
fired by the little torch- carried ln the hat
of the miner whose pick freed It.
There has never been any fire of any
kind in the stope. and never before has
gas been encountered ln that part of the
mine. But a brief tp ;he disas
ter one of the foremen of the mine had
made his round, for it was Just prior to
the time when the shifts changed that the
accident occurred. These facts, whtch
were brought out at I roner'a ln<iut--;t
w that the Â«-xj>lo<Â«ton
â  rfbutable cc. but to
the purest accident.
The pad affair hn* thrown the little min
ing town in gloom, for both the dead min
ers leave widows and nearly all the in
jured men have families resident there.
The funeral of the victims will take place
-row. The mine was ready for the
resumption of business this morning, but
the management closed it until Thursday
out of respect to the dead.
CARELESSNESS CAUSED
CARBONADO DISASTER
CARBONADO. Dec. 12.-The finding of
a miner's open lamp and black pipe prob
ably explains the story of the awful cat
astrophe that occurred at Carbonado Sat
urday. Great as was yesterday's sorrow
which pressed upon this little community,
it Is nothing to what the developments of
to-day have added. That one of their
numberâ a man of years and experience
and knowing the constant danger that at
tended him and his fellows in the mine
should deliberately endanger not only his
own life but that of his son and hun
dreds of his fellow workmen Is a mat
ter which Carbonado was not prepared
! for. Yet such Is the Indubitable mute and
positive evidence which is now before the
Coroner's Jury. Safety lamp No. 170,
blackened and battered, with Its bowl
gone and screws filled with soot and coal
dust, was picked up by nome of the res
cuing party late last night in the inside
end of the fourth level of the sixty-sev
enth crosscut. Beside it lay a miner's
pipe and tobacco bag. with a little dusty
tobacco In the bottom of the bag. An
j examination of the shift book revealed

I found a short distance away and the bowl

tance away, where it had been blown up
the slope. His miner's tools were found

ACCUSES MOLINEUX.
Deductions Drawn by Handwriting
Expert Kinsley.
NEW YORK. Dec. 12.â T0-day's session
in the trial of Roland B. Mollneux was
devoted entirely to the examination of
William J. Kinsley, the handwriting ex
pert. The proceedings were devoid of
public Interest, the scene in the courtroom
resembling the classroom of a business
college. The expert explained even the
most minute .1. â¢.:. -. an entire hour be
ing spent upon the word "please."
The important portion of the testimony
Of Expert Kinsley may be summed up
by the atatement that ho testified that
after examining thousands of specimen*
of handwriting, including samples from
every member, and every employe of the
Knickerbocker Club, he became con
vinced that or.- person wrote the so
called "Barnett" and "Cornish" letters;
that the same man wrote the address on
the poison package, and' that that man
was Roland B. Mollneux.

CRITICIZED THE
KAISER'S SPEECH
Lieber Creates a Sensa
tion in the Reichstag".
IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE
WILLIAM'S FAVORITE NAVAL
BILL MAY SUFFER.
Special DUpatch to The CaJl.
BERLIN. Dec. 12.â The event of the day
ha? been Dr. Lleber's criticism in the
Reichstag, of Emperor William's speech
at Hamburg. The spectacle of this cau
tious leader Of the Important group in the
Reichstagâ the section that will dectne
the naval billâ thus severely blaming t:i-
Kaiser. Is almost without a uarallel in
German parliamentary history. It was all
the more notable because Count yon Bal
lestrem, president of the Reichstag, up
held the dignity of the chamber, and
maintained freedom of speech even
against the Imperial Chancellor.
This evening parliamentary circles are
all agog over the Incident. By some it
is said that Count yon Ballestrem. who
on several previous occasions stopped
similar criticism, had In this Instance a
personal motive for permitting unre
strained comment, because, as one of the
chief opponents of the canal bill, he be
came persona r.on grata with the Em
peror, who banished him from court, in
any event, the affair has not Improved
the chances of the naval bill.
During Hie debate In the Reichstag: to
day on the first reading of the bUGget
estimates, Dr. Lleber observed that the
favorable financial situation was due to
the careful manner In which the House
scrutinized the budget. This practice, he
continued, should be adhered to. Tne
"Prussian financial juggler" (Dr. yon
Michel) he further remarked, had "ba3ed
the estimates of permanent expenditure
on fluctuating revenues." This, accord-
Ing to the speaker, was impolitic, and a
heavy penalty would have to be paid for
It some day. The Centrists were of tne
opinion that the Government's require
ments could be met without recourse to
fresh taxation. At present he was not
prepared to say whether or not ,ie would
support the naval bill. The declaration of
the Government, the speaker claimed,
would have had great weight if It had not
been given publicity beforehand, thus
slighting the Reichstag.
Dr. Ueber concluded with saying that
past and future events would prove to the
Emperor that he had been 111-informed in
Hamburg regarding the feelings of the
German people. During the first eight!
years of the Emperor's reign the Reich
stag had bjr no means persistently re
fused to increase the navy.
Prince Hohenlohe. the Imperial Chan
cellor, said he sincerely regretted that the
Emperor's speech had been introduced in
the debate. The speech, he added, had
been called forth by the political situa
tion. It was an expression of solicitude
from the monarch for the power and
prestige of the fatherland. In view of
the eminent position which the King of
Prussia occupied as German Emperor
his right to exhort his people to unity In
order to achieve great ends and to give
expression to his wishes could not be con
tested.
Count yon Ballestrem. President of the
Reichstag, intimated that he had already
ruled that members of the Reichstag
could not be debarred from discussing in
a suitable manner the speeches of the
Emperor as published in the Reichsan
zeiger, adding: . "I should regard myself
as trenching nn the highly important po
sition which the Emperor occupied in po
litical life If I did not allow his significant
utterance* to be mentioned here. This:
must, of course, be done decorously, and
In my opinion the previous speaker com
piled with this condition."
Count yon Lomburg-Stlrum. Conserva
tive, declared that the financial situation
demanded the grf-at^Ht economy, There
could not be much retrenchment In the
foreign estimates, but while a certain
credit was due to Count yon Bulow both
agriculture and manufactures were suf
fering from the present relations with
America. Prince Hohenlohe fully grasped
the gravity of the situation, and the
speaker said that the naval question and
the relative power of the states had
changed but little during the last two
years. But, he added, the Hispano- 1
American and Transvaal wars had im
pelled the conservative party to concur in
the opinions of the Government. The
growing antipathy to England and Eng
lish policy, he asserted, was remarkable,
though Mr. Chamberlain's speech and the
speeches of British statesmen generally
had little more value than electoral
speeches.
Herr n^hei (Socialist) declare that the
increasing loans were in opposition to the
rosy exposition of the budget. The em
pire's debt, he" asserted, had increased
enormously, and Germany did a miserable
business with her colonies. Too much was
paid for the Caroline Islands, and Klao
chau was never a fever nest. To Increase
German trade proportionately with a new
fleet was a difficult matter. According to
the speaker yesterday's speeches seemed
better adapted to the Navy League than
to the Reichstag. With Great Britain's
fleet and Germany's army the two coun
tries could rule the world.
The Secretary of the Navy.- Admiral Tlr
jiitz. said that when the last naval bill
was presented he did not know the extent
of German industries. In a naval war,
the secretary asserted, the worklngmen
would be the first sufferers. The House
then adjourned.

11. ARITHMETIC OF THE OFFICE.
Lesson No. 4 â Discount. ,
Last week we learned how to discount
accounts; our lesson this week relates to
the discounting of promissory notes and
other commercial paper.
Notes and drafts are usually drawn for
periods not exceeding four months. When
they are sold to banKs or to note brokers
discount is reckoned from the date of sale
to the date of maturity. In some States
both the day of sale (usually referred to
as the day of discount) and the day of
maturity are considered. That Is to Â«â &>-.
if a note is discounted November 9 and
matures November 20 the discount Is
reckoned for 12 days, both th" 3th and 20th
being counted. In the exercises which
are given here both days are to be con
sidered. The banker argues that the bor
rower has the use of the money upon the
day of discount and he need not pay It
until the closing hour of the day of ma
turity. Note the following brief exer
cises:
A note for $720 dated July 5. lttÂ«9. at 3
months, is discounted August IS at 7 per
cent; nnd the cash proceeds.
We proceed first to find the day of ma
turityâthat Is, the day when the note
becomes due. Three months from July 5
will be October Z. The note falls due on
October 5. If thÂ»Â» note had read 00 days
after date Instead of three months it
would fall due 90 days after July 5. or
October 3: 26 days In July, 31 days in
August. M day? In September and 3 days
In October make 90 days. The note falls
due October 3 and it is discounted August
1.'.. The banker loans the money, then,
from August 15 to October 6. If we count
both of these dates, as is the custom in
many of the States, the money will be
loaned for 52. days. Now the banker
charges Interest on $720 at 7 per cent for
52 days.
The Interest at 6 per cent Is *> 24 and
at 7 per cent It Is one-sixth more, or 17 '.â¢>
The rash proceeds of the note, then, will
be 1720, less J7 _v or $713 72.
Where Interest and discount tables are
used accurate interest is sometimes reck
oned. Accurate Interest when discounting
or when paying interest on accounts or on
borrowed money Is always more favorable
to the borrower.
A merchant accepts on September 4 a
90-day note In payment of an account of
$1266 40. On September 9 he has the note
discounted at his bank at 04 per cent;
find the cash proceeds.
This note will mature on December 3.
and from September 9 to December 3
(counting both days) there nre S3 days.
The discount, then. Is reckoned for M
days, and the solution la as follows:
tlce They should be made quite rapidly
without the aid of the lingers. The little
nriÃer should Â«t!id- freely over the paper
In making them. The power should corns
from the shouJder and elbow. Those who
write easiest and best use considerable
arm movementâ more arm than finger ac
ticn. To use the arm movement success
fully the arm must rest on the cushion of
muscle Just In front of the elbow on the
undÂ«*r side of the arm.
Study critically th* plate of minimum
letters! herewith. Note how simple, how
rounding and how plain. To write lertbljr
bo sure to make n unlike v. close the o
and keep ltÂ» finish high so It will not re
semble a, close the- a. keep v and th* sec
ond part of -x open so they do not resem
ble o. and space well between the letters.
1.'.0k critically ov. r your own hand and
i*** if your un an! n's. o's and as. Â«â¢'â 
and l's. are not too similar to bÂ« legible
except by context.
Many persons write Illegibly because the
forms they learned (or rather failed to
learn) were too Intricate and therefore too
difficult. The extended forms Riven show
how many loops may be dispensed with
and how others may be made more plain.
Always cross the t (not the letter fol
lowing It), loop the I, finish the b carefully
(so that it does not resemble le or h) and
clote he a part of d. I and q. and your
writing will doubtless be at least legible.
You need not slavishly Imitate the letters
given herewith to write legibly. But you
should study Carefully the Individuality
of letter*. Such study will lead you to
discover defect* In your own. Our writing
Improve* only as we locate our mistakes.
Merely to know that our writing is poor
is not enough to improve It. We must
know wherein it l.Â« poor and then correct
the fault.', ono by one.
Not only should your writing be legible
and rapid but It should be as distinctly
your own as your manner of walking and
talking. Surely you would not wish It to
be poor, as it reflects character the same
an walking and talking. Endeavor to
write well the style you like best. As a
means of Improving your style and man
ner, you will do well to practice the ac
companying forms. Such practice and
Imitation will develop Judgment and skill
âtwo good things to posm-ss.
Noteâ This course of three lessons by
C. P. Zaner will be continued next week-
When we have found the Interest at â¢
per cent we can find the interest at <<4
per cent by adding one-twelfth to the re
sult. The cash nroceid* will be SI3K 40.
less $1Â» 64. or $1246 74.
The student will now proceed to solve
the following examples:
1. A note for SlaÂ«> dated June 15 at four
months la discounted on the same day at
6 per cent. Kind the cash proceeds. (TvÂ«
time will be four months and one day.)

EASTERN MARKETS,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Pec. 12.â Th* stock market dis
played a feverish tone as consequence of the
violent scakedown of yesterday. Although
there was tome bHMed liquidation, prices were
ri't without support st any time, and where
breaches were made in values the character of
the buylr.g at the decline made It look as
thoiik-h the mnnlpulatlon for a Call was for the
purpose of taking on stocks. There was a no
table volume of commission house buying.
which indicated that outsiders had been at
trarted by tbs lower level of r rtoaa. There
were points in the Industrial list which dlÂ»
pUyed notable n-jsistance all day. and during
the latter i^art of the trading mm positive
rtrenrth. 8omÂ» of the sharp declines in the
railroad lift, nr.table In the Grangers, were at
tributed to a shifting of holdings from that
croup Into nome of the Industrials. The Grang
er* tcÂ»uclied lower srtosa than In the demonstra
tion'of yesterday and they were practically
the only Â«r>cks In the lUt to do so. That therÂ«
Is rtlll a large and aggressive bear party in
the market was evident. Their tactic* were
totally mcceetful m the morning, especially In
the oa*e of Tennessee Coal and Metropolitan
Ftn-et Hallway, which were forced down 64
and l>\ resj>ectlvÂ«?ly. Money at no time ruled
ever k rwr cent, and In the afternoon wa* of
fered down to 4 pÂ»r cent. The Impression was
Â«Â»ir"ud that eume of the very lart'e individual
cpTators had ftiecome . pof scsted â ' a liberal

Tniders generally turned to the bull side an(

troke four points to near the .lowest and very
nur-h unsettled the whole ll tt. Reactions were
ronflned to fractions outside of Tobacco and
I'.ronklyn Transit and a few other Industrials.
The rioting was thus made Irregular and with

until the close of business, but It explained the

PROMPT ACTION
SAVED THEM AT
DEATH'S DOOR
Two Young Women
Who Tired of Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
ivw Broadway. Dec. 12.
Hereditary suicidal mania Is the sup
posed cause that Impelled Mrs. Mamie
Fulllvan, a housewife, agÂ»>d 23 years and
residing at l'l Second street, to swallow
a deadly potion this afternoon.
Fhe was found lying on the porch in
front of her residence by neighbors and
wa* promptly brought to the Receiving
Hospital In a state of stupefaction. The
peculiar symptoms shown Inclined the
hospital physicians to the belief that it
was a case of belladonna poisoning. The
stomach pump was applied, but the con
tents did not reveal the nature of the
poison taken. After several hours of
hard work the physicians succeeded In
reviving Mrs. Sullivan and when asked
whether sh<- h;id taken earl-ojic acid she
â whispered. "No; I took muriatic add."
Her husband. William Sullivan, is a
plumber by occupation, and It is supposed
rhÂ« wrurÂ»-<i the acid from a bottle the
husband used in his work.
Mrs. Sullivan's escape From death was
a very narrow one. she was removed to
her home to-night, and, though restored
to consciousness, she refused to dlvulgo
the cans* of her rash act. However, she
whispered to Matron McDonald at the
hospital that she "had only done It to
frtgnten the folks." It appears that the
FUiddaJ m.n.l.i exists In her family. Her
sister. Mrs. Cooney I>nr.. committed sui
cide about two years ago by taking car
bolic acid, and . irs. Sullivan. It Is said,
tried to end her life once tÂ»<forc. sevr-ral
months ago. Fhe is the mother of two
small children and '.â¢â  a sister of J. Col-

90S Broadway. Dec. 12.
The outcome of the successful exhibi
tion of the Oakland' Poultry Association,
the California Collie Club and the Pacific
Pigeon Club, which has Just closed in this
city, is a move to unite the poultry inter
ests over the entire State, and bring them
together In dm general State organisation
that will bring the California poultry In
dustry to the front in the United States.
Th. are now some fourteen different
poultry organizations in different parts of
the 1 State, each one doing, good work in
its own locality, but without any State
organization or any established relations
with the other organizations. The Idea
was advanced of organizing â  State Poul
try Association, to be" composed of dele
gates from the various local poultry asso
ciations and to bring about a more com
plete understanding and harmony of
chicken interests of the State.

burglary at Gotfs Alameda Jewelry store
with Wilbert Wlllm<>re. who during the
chase that followed was shot and killed,
made ar star move this afternoon In Judge
Hall's court when the accused was called
to take the wltr.es* stand In hlÂ» own be

found burglar's tools on him at the City

The prosecution hud plac^-d much

Hrnmpton and Wfli-h and John Conrad.
Alameda's Chief of Police, during the
morning. They had testified that Sullivan

In explaining the circumstances of his
capture Sullivan testified: "I was down

there was but one way to Ret up. When

his possession the nippers, jimmies,
shears and brace. "I never had these on

REVIVAL OF NEW YEAR'S RECEPTION
CAUSES GOSSIP IN OAKLAND
MRS. F. M. SMITH, WHO WILL RHVIVE THe OLD CUSTOM.
OAKLAND. Dec 11â Mr* F. M. Smith, wife of the man who owns
nil of the borax mini In the country and rnojt of Â»â¢,,,. street mii
â¢ roads In Oakland, announced .i few days ago that she would cele
brate the advent of the new century the good old century wayâ
that she would receive her friends upon th. first day of the year
and would "revive an old custom." Mrs. K. m Smith has takm much In
terest in Oakland and Its society ror BM time past, and this meant mere
ly that she would receive her friends and guests upon the blithe New Year
day In bet usual hospitable way. To most of Oakland it was an Interest
in if return of the old New Year custom which has long; since fallen into
disuse.
But as the days went by and the announcement was passed around that
Mrs. P. M. Smith wa going to rive an old custom." there loomed upon
the horizon a tiny cloud th it grew around that expression â the revival of
the old custom. There were those who could not disassociate from the "re
vival of the old custom" the old. old story of the New Year treating and
It* results.
Now, what did Mrs. Smith mean by "reviving an Old custom?"
With that question went the other. DoÂ»b it mean a sideboard and a
bunch howl?
And while no one baa asked Ml . Smith what details she. Intends to In
clude in her "revival." the prohibition tongue baa been raised in protest
aajnlnsi the possibilities of â  too complete revlvnl of the "old custom."
Said Mrs. M. K. Blake of the Non-Partisan Christian Temperance Un-
Inn: "I deplore the news that any Oakland society lady of Influence Is pro
posing to keep an open house on New Year's day that will Include an open
sideboard. I bad hoped that this custom had died out. a New Year'a re
ception is one thing itnd .1 revival of the old New Year's custom with Its
open sideboard Is quite another. This latter revival of the old custom would
be very mistaken hospitality, and I trust that there will be no revival of
the sideboard custom."
S. P. Meads, a leader of the prohibitionists and a professor In the Oakland
High School, said: "I should regret very much to see the custom of giving
Intoxicating liquors to guests on New Year's day revived again In Oakland.
I should esteem it ii grave error on the part of those who have any consid
eration at all for the welfare of the youth of Oakland."
Rev. E. U. DOle, paster of the First Methodist Church, said: "I should
greatly regret to see the revival of this old custom. Even aside from the
wine drinking I would deprecate Its revival, IS I consider the holiday tlnu
as sacred to thÂ» home, and It should not be invaded by social duties."
Rev. R. K. Coyle thinks that New Year's sociability Is a very pleasant
thing, and says: "The New Year'i ccbratlons which I remember seeing and
Joining in years ago In the East were very pleasant affairs, and 1 would re
gard with favor the revival of the custom. New Year's day Is an especially
appropriate lime for the formation of new friendships and the renewal of old
ones, and there Is no reason why objectionable features should be Intro
duced."
Mrs. K. M. Smith sees nothing to discuss in her proposition to "revive
the old custom" of New Year's receptions. Mm says thnt she has not de
cided whether she will have 11 punch bowl upon that occasion, and that she
can always he trusted to "do the proper thing." With these words those who
worry over Mrs. Smith 1 "revival of the old custom" must bÂ« satisfied.
"I have no desire whatever to discus* this matter." said Mrs. Smith to
night. "I have simply decided that on New Year's day I will keep open house
and you can use that expression If you will. As to whether I will have a
punch bowl on thai occasion I do not know, for really I have not given the
subject any thought. In fact. I have r:ot >et decided upon our menu. I do
not kuow what we will put on the table or what there will be to drink My
friend* know very well what kind of a house I keep, and whether I rive
them r\ glÂ«is of water or a cup of coffee to drink they have never found oc
casion to complain. â¢
"It is nothing new for us to receive our friends on New Year's day Why
really, we never stopped doing so. It Is n good, old-fashioned custom to re
ceive your gentlemen friends on that day and to receive the ladies a few days
later, and It's nothing for us to do that. I run not imagine the cause of all
this talk, Why. this afternoon, while I was attending a card party at a
lady's house I was asked whether I favored a punch bowl or New Year* day
and I said 1 had not given thÂ» subject nny thought. Then I was asked
whether I was not afraid that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union
might get after me. well. I certainly have no reasons to fear them, and I
never was so Insulted.
"There are several reasons for onr holding one n house on New Year's Any.
In the first place. I have said It Is a good old-fashioned rtiPtnm which we hayÂ«
ever followed. Then, agnln. Ney Year's Is my mother's birthday. She will be
78 years of age. and I think that is Just cause for congratulation, and if there
were no other reasons for our hold! nit open house that would be a good rea
son. And finally. Mr. Smith and I will never again *Â»c a century go out or a
new one come. in. and that Is another reason. Indr ed. it will be a good day on
which to make new acquaintances and keep up old ones.

MORE SURGEONS
TO BE BROUGHT
INTO THE ARMY
Bill to Increase the
Medical Corps.
DRAWN BY GEN. STERNBERG
The headquarters of the medical corps
at Washlngti-n Is working on a bill to In
crease the force of surgeons in the army,
and a copy of the proposed measure has
been sent out to Colonel Forwood, chief
Medical officer of this department and to
several of the army surgeons on duty oat
here.
The bill provides for the appointment, of
four assistant surgeon generals of the
rank of colonel; ten deputy surgeon gen
erals with the rank of lieutenant colonel;
thirty surgeons with the rank of major,
and eighty assistant surgeons with tie
rank of first lieutenant, they to become
captains after live years' service. All
vacancies to be created by the bill to De
filled by the promotion of those now in
the service.
It Is In the method of providing for the
appointment of the new assistant sur
geons that the bill Is particularly inter
esting. It is provided that all candidates
for the position of assistant surgeon shall
first be appointed acting assistant sur
geons for a probationary period of six
months, during which time they will be
paid $100 a month. It is provided that
they shall attend the army medical school
attached to the army medical museum at
Washington, and the faculty shall report
upoti them. If the recommendation oe
favorable they will be commissioned as
sistant surgeons. the faculty shall repjrt
j them. If the recommendation M
irable they will be commissioned as
int surgeons.
The medical corps of the ' army 13 at
present composed of 132 regular ofllcers of
all rank, 4 â '! contract surgeons, 45 volun
teer regimental surgeons and 22 volunteer
brigade Burgeons, a total of <&'.*. The army
has now a strength of close to a hundred
thousand nun, and It is clear that it will
never go (â ..( to the' skeleton formation
of former times of peace oven should Con
gress not increase it. The force of sur
geons is barely sufficient now, and It is
more than probable, therefore, that Gen
eral Sternberg's bill will go through.
The tenor of the bill for the acting as
sistant suryeens is to give them the same
rights as volunteer medical officers who
hold commissions. At present they. get
the pay and some of the courtesies due
a first lieutenant, but that is all. If they
are sick and incapacitated a from wurk
they are not paid so long as they are oft
duty; if they are given leave they get
no pay until they return; they are not
entitled to commutation of .quarters,
which means that if there la no room for
them at a military poet they must find
quarters tor themselves and at their own
expense elsewhere. They are not entitled
to the mileage or travel pay of the com
missioned medical officer., and they are
not entitled to the one month's gratuity
paid those who served during the war In
this country nor the two months > paid
those who served outside the country.
What they want is to be commissioned as
the volunteer medical officer Is commis
sioned, to be discharged at thÂ» pleasure
of the fJovernmuiU, but while In the
service to have all the rights and privi
leges of an officer and particularly of an
officer of the medical corps.
The Forty-eighth Infantry will git
away from Angel Island on the Grant
on December 2". The regiment is now
undergoing a thorough cleaningâ a medi
cal cleaningâ and to-morrow It will be re
leased from detention. Friday the men
will be paid and Saturday they will be
ready to leave-
It was at first an open question whether
the Grant would be sent north to load a
cargo of hay or over to Angel Island to
take on the Forty-eighth, but It seems
to have been di elded that, the men are
wanted more than the hay. If the Grant
should be pent after the hny the only
transport left would be the Sheridan, and
she will not be ready for the return trip
until the 24th. It has been decided not
to keep the regiment here that long, so
the Sheridan will take the hay and the
Grant will take the men.

COURT-MARTIAL
ON THE REVENUE
CUTTER RUSH
One of the Engineers
in Trouble.
GAMBLERS WANT HUMBOLDT
The. '.officers on the revenue cutter
Rush are not a happy family. For nearly
a year there has been more or less bad
feeling- between, those In the deck depart
ment and the men in' charge of the engine
room. . During the last cruise in Alaskan
waters' there were many differences of
opinion and when the Rush reached here
on September 28 from Dutch Harbor there
were rumors -of impending trouble. Noth
ing more was heard of the matter and
everybody in the revenue service thought
it had been settled.
It had only slumbered until the deck de
partment was ready to act. The result
13 that Second Assistant Engineer Hall is
now being tried by court-martial for
"conduct unbecoming an officer and a
gentleman" and "refusing to obey the or
ders of his superior officer."
The charges are preferred by First
Lieutenant W. G. Dodge and as the evi
dence in the ease is quite voluminous the
trial will probably last a week. Captain
C. L. will probably aof the court and
L. Hooper is president of the. court ami
is determined to get at all the facts of
the case. It appears that the nrst lieuten
ant and second engineer were at logger
heads during the entire cruise in Bering
Sea and nearly every membr of the crew
is a witness in the case. Some of the
men favor one ofllcer and some the other;
so at the present time the revenue cutter
Rush is a ship divided against herself.
The last passenger steamer Humboldt
is already In demand for the Cape Nome
trade. Last reason she ran between beat
tie and Skaguay and was very successful,
owing to her speed and excellent accom
modations. Next season she may go
back into the HUM trade, but if certain
Seattle' parties can get her she will make
one trip to Nome. A large sum has been
offered for the vessel and the idea is to
send sixty men and twenty-live women
to the gold fields on her from Seattle.
Everything necessary to establish a small
colony in the heart of Nome will accom
pany the passengers. Among these will be
all kinds of gambling outnttt and the fur
niture for a "swell saloon.
â¢The Humboldt will only make the one
trip to Nome. As soon as she lands her
passengers she will return to the Sound
and resume her regular business. Max
Kallsh. agent of the steamer, admits; that
an offer has been made for the vessel, but
that everything else connected with the
matter is "In the air." The gamblers and
women want to be the first to reach Nome
in the spring and therein a difficulty
arises. No one wants to send a vessel
in before the ice Is gone, and as the
would-be charterers want the Humboldt
to take those chances, the whole scheme
may fail. At the present time the Hum
boldt is lying at the Howard street coal
bunkers, but goes, to Benicla to-day to be
cleaned and painted.
Tho Marine Engineers were few and far
botween on the front yesterday. Nearly

â¢â¢Hill" Bendt of the Bowhead Saloon,
on the front, has n carrier pigeon "No. A

have it on application. Hill has a largo
number of the common kind of pigeon and
while he was feeding them yesterday the
carrier alighted on his shoulder. It seems
to be quite a pet and made no funs over
being caught and nut In a cage. It has
probably escaped from some pigeon fan

EX-COLLECTOR SAUNDERS
CHARGED WITH FORGERY
TACOMA, Doc. 12â A Federal Grand
Jury has been, earnestly engaged for sev
eral days In Investigating the charge
made .by William Eldridge. one .of the
sureties upon the official bond of ex-Col
lector Saunders of Tort Townsend, who
mays that his signature upon the Saun
ders bond was a forgery. Several hand
writing experts have been before the
Grand Jury, and testimony has been In
troduced to show that Eldridge did not
and could not sign his own name, and
that It was his practice to have various
members of his family sign- for him.
It Is an interesting fact in connection
with th.- case that the whereabouts of
S.iunders Is now unknown, the most
diligent inquiry having failed to locate
him. When last heard of he was in Ar
kansas. Saundors was Collector of Cus
toms for the Puget Sound district during
Cleveland's second term, and was then
the moist prominent Democrat In the
State. Irately troubles have come fast
Upon him. About the time his term ex
pired stories were published Involving al
leged forged stock certificates In which
the ex-Collector's name was unpleasant
ly connected. Later came the story from
Huffalo that Saunders' child had died as
the result of Improper medical treatment
and that" he and others had been arrested
for Indulging In the practice of Christian
science In an endeavor to save the child a
life
The charge had hardly been dismissed
when the Federal court held that certain
warehouse fees which Saunders claimed
were part of his salary had been illegally
retained by him. â¢
PEYTON'S FIRST
WIFE SUES HIM
BTpKANE.- Dec. 12.-Colonel I. N. Pey
ton, a Epokane millionaire, came nero
years ago as Colonel George. H. Morgan.
He lived here .some time under that name
and in .Spokane boom days when all the
country round was platted there were ad
ditions bearing the name of Morgan. The
colonel's past returned to plague him.
The first wife came to town and it trans
pired one day that his name was. Peyton
and that be had <iul- tiy obtained a
divorce f rcm tin- first Mr.-. Peyton and
had married again m Morgan. There was
a sensation, but a larger one Is on now.
The first Mrs. Pe>ton, who li a resident
of Denver, has filed suit against the
whilom Colonel Morgan for half of the
million dollars which . she alleges he is
worth, nnd charges that the divorce was
obtained by fraud and that the marriage
with his pfesi-nt wife is void.
She says I he was married to the colonel
at Champagne. 111., in ISC9. They re
moved to Colorado, where they resided
until IS7B, when they started East to visit
relative. At St. Ixiviii* the colonel, dls
aii[MÂ«'od Then, he came to this State
and assumed the , name of Morgan. In
ISSG the dÂ» sorted wife discovered him and
came here. She says he promised Â»n
support her If Bho would go back to
Denver She went back, but the colonel
contributed nothing. Three years prior to
his discovery by the first wife he had
quietly obtained a divorce under his right
name.' Peyton, in an adjoining county,
Senator Turner. being then the Judge.
The defense claims that . the divorce
was legal and that there was a division
of the colonel* property at a time wliÂ«>n
he was worth far less than now. and that
through lucky investments, particularly
In X-enoy stock, bis. fortune has- grown to
mammoth proportions. The case- prom

HOLDERS OF FEDERAL
OFFICES TO BE BARRED
NEW YORK, Dec. 11â President Mc-
Kinlev has made it known within the la.v
twenty-four hours to certain important
Republicans in the State of New York
that he-does not favor the idea Of sending
Federal office holders as delegates to the
next Republican National Convention.
Ever since the days of Grant and Hayes
and Arthur and Harrison Republican na
tional conventions have been crowded by
Federal ofllce holders as delegates. lÂ»reÂ«Â«l
dent McKlnley's suggestion on this mat
ter, it is said, will be hard to carry out in
some of the Souther?] States, Â«'Â«> yet if
Henry C. Payne's resolution to elect dele
pates according to the Republican vote in
all Congressional -districts is carried out
the task wilt* not be so hard.
The greatest trouble, it Is said, will
come from the States of Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan. Illinois. -Wisconsin and Min
nesota. But the President is determined
no Federal offH-e holder shall be elected as
delegate.

MRS. F. GALE'S STORY
OF THE GEYSER SCANDAL
Reiterates Charges of Bigamy
Against Her Husband.
Denies That She Is an Adventuress or
Blackmailer, but Seeks Freedom In
stead of the Fisk Fortune.
TITEUE Is a Shook In store for Mr
Gale of the G*Â»ysors when the suit
brought against him by Frankie
Grant Gale for an annullment of
their marriage tlf-s comes to trial.
The plaintiff has beÂ»Â«n characterised by
Mr. Gale and his relatives and friends as
a designing woman whose motive In
it.arrylmr him was to secure the property
rbe thought hÂ« possessed, and who, fall
in* to find anything worth having after
fhe got him, seeks to levy blackmail on
the Vl*k family, of which he Is a mem
ber, by threatening It with scandal.
While the allegations of tv-ing a black
mailer and an adventuress have not Iwen
rlcaumt to Mrs. Gale they have not al
tered her determination to force the Issue
and produce the evidence which she
claims will prove beyond question that
Gale Is not the saint that he represents
himself to be, and that in the eyes of the
law he 1* a bigamist* She does not Intend
to Ftcp with her endt-uvcrs to have her
marriage with him annulled, but as soon
urn that bit of legal contention Is over It
is her purpose to have him prosecuted for
what she claims Is his perfidy.
Mrs. Gale irankJy admits that she is a
horrible example oÂ£ the oKI adace, "Marry
in haste ;-;ii repent at leisure." Now that
t>ho i.~.- awakened to that fact, she is at
v. losm fur ait explanation as io how and
why i-.V- l!Â»icueU to viale's proleÂ»tatlons

"Why 1 married Gale," she says, "I

that momentarily disarms any suspicion

this city when Gale first became acquaint
ed with her. If Gale's career with her
constitutes a common law marriage, the
defendant would appear to have Just one
wile too many. lira, Gale makes the fol
lowing statement In her own hehalf:
"Deep in every one's breast Is rooted an
Inborn sense of justice a love of fair play
âand now . that my husband and hiÂ»
friends have had their fling and exhausted
their venomed dans I feel that my side
of the story should be heard. A few days
aftur my arrival at the Geysers, June 30
of tills year, I was Introduced to Adelbert
Gale by hi* niece. Mrs. Arthur Flak. From
this time on he devoted himself to me.
and, 1 blush to admit It, I learned to love
him. lie represented that he was the pro
prietor of the Geysers, but after our wed
ding ] learned thai he wan only the hired
man. I was not after his money, for 1 :
know that he had none, but 1 was led to
believe that he had an Income sufficient
to care for a wife. When 1 learned that
lie had not I tried to persuade him to go
bacK with me to my homo In Colorado,
where 1 thought i could secure him a
good situation. He demurred, saying that
lils sister, Mrs. Flak, had hinted to him
that she was going to provide for him in
her will and he dared not leave the Gey
sers for fear of displeasing her. To this
1 replied: 'What do we care? We can
live without them.' Bo much for the
part the Fisk fortune played in my mar
riage. Are those the tactics an adven
turess would have pursued?
"I kept nothing of my past life away
from my husband. I told him that I was
a divorced woman and I told Mrs. Flak.
They knew of my antecedents, for tele
grams from my father in Denver were !
telt-phoned from Cloverdale to Ike
Wertheixner at the Geysers and by him

knew of this other rife, and shame be to
her that she did not warn me. Verily,
thÂ«>y played the Good Samaritan, for " 1 '
"was a stranger and they took me in.' i
Mrs. Fisk stated to me the night of Sep-
Icnitxr IX) or lil of this year, when 1 was
at her home in this city, that she had
harbored this Mrs. Emma Gale, and when
the latter refused to go to the Geysers
with her reputed husband. Adell Gale,
she (Mrs. iiski advanced her JCO with
which to go Bast. This occurred about
November 1 of last year. Within nine
months the husband of Emma Gale had '
takÂ«Â»n another wife and 1 war. that unfor- I
tur.ate.
"Since I brought this suit Gale has
pleaded with me for an Interview, and at
last 1 consented to see him last Friday
night. He wanted me to withdraw the
suit and return to him at the Geysers. I
refused, of course, and pleaded with him
;o acknowledge the truth of the things
he had confessed to me. 'No.' he replied;
'if 1 do. what is there In It for me? 1 He
knew that I had property, for he was
careful to make inquiries on this point
before I married him. I told him that I
was aJor.Â« here, almost friendless, and
only asked him to help me right myself."
Gale's statement made to a Call reporter
substantiates in many details the version
of the affair presented by his wife. He
admitted that she wanted him to go to
Denver with her and also that h*> sought
an interview with her in which she plead
ed with him to right the alleged wrong
he had done her.
cd. and. peizinr a chair, she struck him
on the head with it. which made him re
lease his hold. He went away and return
ed a few hours later, pretending; that he
was sorry for what he bad done. He ask
ed hÂ«-r to take a ride with him to the Cliff
Houk<\ and before they reached there he
wanted her to leave the car. as he had
something to show her. She was sus
picious and declined. She afterward
learned that he had a razor In his pocket
which he had taken from the 6hop with
the intention of killing her.
After they returned rrom the Cliff
House Damon told her that he would fin
ish her off pure the next time, as he would
get a revolver, and to protect herself she
secured a warrant for his arrest on a
chanre of battery. Monday evening he
chased her out of the house and was nr

INFURIATED BUFFALO ATTACKS
PARK POLICE CAPTAIN THOMSON
The Maddened Bison Charges Upon His Pursuer.
SZ=^ ATTAIN S. If. THOMSON of the park police
v had a narrow escape yesterday from a fearful
U death. Mi was attacked by an Infuriated bull
x^z^ buffalo that tossed him and the horse upon which
he was mounted, attaching him again and again
as he lay helpless on the ground, after It had disem
boweled his steed. The timely arrival of assistance un
doubtedly caved bin from â  similar fate.
The accident was the result of an attempt to tenant
the new buffalo paddock in Golden Gate Park with some
of the denizens of the old enclosure near Stow Lake.
Captain Thomson and five mounted men started early in
the morning to make the transfer. Before noon thÂ«y
had managed without trouble to get three of the bulls
into the new paddcck, which Is situated close to the
water tank on the bicycle path. After luncheon the two
remaining: bulls were taken out of their corral and
started along the rood for their new quarters.
Although one of the buffaloes had manifested signs
of uneasiness several times on the way, Captain Thom
son and his men had almost reached the water tank
without mishap. One of the men, Walter Jansen, had
been sent ahead to open the paddock pate and Thomson
and the others started to drive their charges toward it.
Both buffaloes broke into a run. the policeman hard after
them, and one of the animals got through Into the pad
dock. The other, by reason of the fact that the gate
was not opened wide enough to suit him, passed It and
ran snorting down the road toward the beach.
Capftn Thomson, leaving; one man In pursuit, made
a sh.'rt cut to head off the runaway animal. He soon
had the bull headed and Charged at him, swinging his
lnrlat. He never threw the rope; Before he could com
prehend the tactics of the buffalo, it had charged, head
down, full at him. The next instant the animal had
horned his horse and tossod It and the rider in the air.
As the horse fell the buffalo charged again, fairly rip

Auditor Wells Refuses to Allow
Treasurer Extra Clerks.
Auditor Wells yesterday notified Treas
urer Truman that he would not audit tho
bills for extra clerk hire for payment of
rebates on personal property taxes. The
Supervisors, at their meeting last Mon
day, on recommendation of the Finance
Committee, passed a resolution appropri
ating $1000, out Â«if funds now in the treas
ury amounting to $^6<*i, being the over
payments of taxes of 1536 which have not
been called for.
The Auditor, on the advice of his at
torney. General Dickinson, contends that
the money cannot be used to pay the
clerks and the Supervisors must take the
money <nn of the -alary fund. Mr. \Wllh
quotes section 3824 of the Political Code*
which says:
"When the tax rate is fixed for the year
In which collections ar>Â» mart" then, if a
sum In excess of the rate has been col
lected, such excess shall not be appor
tioned to the State, but the whole thereof
shall remain in the county treasury and
must be repaid to the person from whom
the collection is made or to his assignee
on demand therefor."
The Auditor also returned to the Super
vipers the demands of the extra clerks
employed by the County Clerk to complete
the work of his office prior to the time of
the new charter going into effect. Tli**
resolution provided that the c-mp-nsation
of the clerks was not to exceed JÂ»?X>, which
wns Â»o be paid out of the "l'r(r.<nt Neces
sity Fund." This fund Is exhausted and
even If It were not the Auditor holds that
he could not pay the demands out of it
ERECTION OF HIGH BUILDINGS.
Supervisors' Fire Committee Over-
looks an Existing Order.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee met
yesterday and recommended that Alvinza
Hay ward be granted permission to erect
a building 145 feet In height on the north
east corner of Montgomery and California
streets. It Is quite likely that the recom
mendation, however, will not be adopted
by the full board, as there is an order in
existence which provides that on all
streets less than 100 feet wide no build
ing shall be erected over 100 feet in height.
ThÂ« petition of E. J. Baldwin for per
mission to repair the store-rooms in the
Baldwin ruins so that they may be rented
during the holidays was postponed until
Friday to await the decision in the test
case now In Judge Treadwell's court.
The committee decided to sustain - the
pinpr it open. Thomson was thrown to the ground, where
he lay stunned, the bull turning on him after It had
wreaked Its fury on the disemboweled home.
Only the shortness :itid the curvature of the buffalo's
horns paved the park police captain from gaping death
wounds. Time and again the animal lowered his head
with the intention of impaling his victim on the horns.
but the captain w.-is too <lose to the ground to receive
more than sore blows from the head of the frothing ani
mal, which, failing in its effort to disembowel him. at
tempted to stamp the life out of him %vith its hoofs. It
would nave succeeded undoubtedly had not some of the
captain's, mon come yelling on the scene.
The buffalo, spent by this time with Its run and its
attacks on the prostrate man and horse, took to flight.
Several of the newcomers gare chase through the brusn.
while others went to the assistance of Captain Thomson,
fully conscious of the gTave peril from which he had
M providentially rescued, sore and bleeding, his
nothing covered with the slaver of the enraged buffalo.
The injured captain was put into the buggy of Superin
tendent McLaren, who came along about that time, and
â¢ ikon to the park Irxi^o, where Dr. Shumate made
an examination of his injuries. The disemboweled horse
was shot to end its agony.
Captain Thomson was suffering intense pain in the
region of the liver and the right lung, in which parts of
hIH body the buffalo had butted him repeatedly In its ef
forts to kill. His lower limbs were sore and bartly
bruised where ho had been stamped upon by the hoofa
of the runaway. Dr. Shumate found that no bones had
been broken, and said his patient would be ready for
duty In several days.
At a la^te hour last night notice was received from
the Golden Gate Park officials that the runaway buffalo
had been captured In the park and had been secured In
a special pen.

THE SILBA MURDER.
The Charg-e Against Policeman Dick-
Bon G. Bell Dismissed by Judge
TreadwelL
Th* preliminary examination of rolice
man Dickson G. Bell on the charge of
murder in connection with the death of
Pedro Silba, bootblack. Kearny street,
near Broad wny, was held before Judge
Twtdiull yesterday, and after hearing
the lostirnony of the witnesses for the
prosecution and defense he dismissed the.
case, remarking that the officer h*td not
used half the power to subdue the pris
oner that the law allowed him. There
was applause In court, which was Instant
ly suppressed.
The witnesses for the prosecution were:
Dr. Zabala. autopsy physician; Dr. H. E.
Morrison of the Harbor Hospital; Philo
mena Silba, who acknowledged that she
had not been married |to Silba; J. B.
stench, C. Ortez, C. RamJre. P. Kngel
brecht, Ignatius Coronel and J. XV. Doug
las, but most of their testimony was fa
vorable to the defendant.
A number of witnesses were put on the
stand for thÂ« defense, who testified that
the defendant did not strike Silba on the
head with his club but that Silba threw
himself several times on the ground and
struck his head against the cobblestones.
Attorney Alexander Campbell Jr., who
represented Silba in the Police Court
prior to his death, testified that Sllba's
character was bad.
EXTRA SESSION SIGNERS.
The fact is disclosed that Senators
other than those mentioned in The Call
yesterday have nut signed <f'>r an extra
session. Senator H. V. Morehousb, who
was in the city yesterday, asserted posi
tively that he had not agreed to go Into
caucus and would not sign such agree
ment, although his name did not appear
In the list of those who had not signed.
Senator Luchslnger thus places himself
on record :
I see by this morning" issue of your paper
that you mentioned the names of Senators
. who have not signed a caucus roll; and
my name i!.--> not appear among them, the .
Inference would be that I had signed for a
call. I wish It understood that I have
signed no petition Tor an extra session, nor
for a caucus, and that the only expression
I have given to my future action Is, '"That
In case an extra session is called I
would go Into a caucus of Republicans of
eighty or over, or If a caucus of sixty-one,
â¢ Republicans were prepared to go Into cau
cus that I with thÂ» balance of the Repub
licans would make it our business to have
the full number .if elithty-nve there. If pos
sible." Yours respectfully
J. J. "i.UCHSINGER. .
VaJleJo. December 12. 1899.
The Call stated yesterday that Senators
Bulla. RowHI. Davis, Taylor, Gillette.
Straiten. Hoyre and Smith had not
slKnod. The statement that all others
had signed was made by the promoters
or the extra session and was so accredited
to them by this paper.

KELLY FOUND
GUILTY OF THE
CHARGES FILED
Grand Jury May Have
the Aftermath.
The Jury in the Thomas A. Kelly trial,
concluded last night before Judge Lawlor.
returned a verdict of guilty a* charged.'
after two and a half hours' deliberation.
Kelly was formerly a clerk In Police
Court 8, and In his capacity accepted
straw bonds which the jury by Its verdict
has found t-> be false and fraudulent.
During the trial a mass of perjured tes
timony was Introduced, and It" Is very
likely that the Grand Jury will take the
matter up before long. Contradictory evi
dence was adduced by the attorneys on
both side*. The bonds were originally
issued to secure the freedom of Harry
Wilson, a colored man.
What Judge Lawlor said in his address
to the Jury after the verdict had been
rendered suggests some Grand Jury work.
It is as follows:
In an early stage of the trlÂ»l of this case on
the guKKeatlon of thÂ« counsel for the defendant,
the court ordered that one copy of certain por'
ilona of the testimony be written up. As the
case progressed the court, of Its own motion
Instructed the shorthand reporter to write up
one copy of the entire testimony One of the
objecu that the court had In mind In makm*
this order was that when the trial was con
cluded the entire testimony should be submU
te.l to the Grand Jury now In session as a
KUlde to that body should It elect to take action
on the suggestions whi<-h the court new feels It
Is Its duty to make. In the Judgment of the
court the grossest and rankest perjury has de
veloped In this caÂ»e in an attempt to defeat Jus
tice. Witnesses have, under the sanctity of an
oath, boldly defied the truth In a manner t<
shock the mural sense and further demoralize
the administration of Justice in this city The
testimony reeks with perjury, and while It is
not the injentlon of the court at this time to
jive expression to its own opinion, still It may
be proper to state that there abides throughout
the rtw an abundance of iwrjured matter
which should engage the closest attention of
the <srand Jury. The court therefore suggest*
to the District Attorney that this entlr- matter
l*> lalvl before that body. To that end It will be
proper to submit the testimony taken here to It
an a basis for Its Investigation.

NTTMPHIA WILL BE CLOSED.
When Lillian I 'ale. keeper of the no
torious Hotel Nymphla, sought to re
strr.ln the Board of Health from closing
the den on account of Its unsanitary con
dition, she resorted to a proceeding In
equity, came Into court "with unclean
hands." and consequently Judge Hoawoll
has decided that she Is entitled to no re
lief. The court dismissed the order to
show cause and dissolved the temporary
restraining order Issued against ttaÂ«
board. Five minutes later the Twinkles
Star Improvement Company, owner of the
den, filed a suit to restrain the Hoard if
Health from Interfering with tne
premises or Inmates thereof, but as the
directors of this company have already
been convicted and fined for renting thÂ«
plate for immoral purposes it is probaole
that the court will also find that their
hands are unclean and will deny them the
relief prayed.
