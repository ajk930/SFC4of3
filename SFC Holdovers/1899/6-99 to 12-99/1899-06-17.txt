COMBINE TO
CONTROL THE
MILK SUPPLY
Dairymen of San Francisco
and Vicinity Forming
a Trust.
A combination which will strike particularly close to the homes
the people of San Francisco is that which is proposed to be
rmed of the dealers in milk and the dairymen in the counties about
ihe bay.
A milk trust â for by whatever euphonious name it may be
known that is what the combination will amount to â is a power which
can make itself felt in the home of every family, rich and poor alike,
it is true the new combination may not design an advance in the price
of this very necessary commodity. It will have the power to advance
prices, nevertheless, should its managers see fit to do that
S ; RAFAEL. Juno 16.â The milk- !
men of San Francisco are about j
to consolidate their interests and j
form one company practically ,
controlling the sale of milk around
the bay. At a meeting held yesterday
it was decided to take immediate step:
to secure the co-operation of as many j
of the large dealers as possible and i
start the business of the company with j
n cash capital of 250.00 '- The move
ment is one of vast importance to the I
public generally, and especially to large
consumers of milk, not only on account
of the basii' principle <>i" the tended j
I" "atioh being monopolistic, but !
reason that it will bring into
a new system as regards the
of milk to customers.
lea of consolidation originated
B. Stewart, president of the
â lara Ranch Company. Several
ago he became Interested in the
: followed by Eastern milk deal- j
â  ! ever since has urged in every I
<sible the introduction of a shn
t^m as regards the sale of milk â 
Francisco. After several weeks j
?st labor he man i - to secure j
ition from dealers to such an '
hat an agent was sent to New
id Chicago tO make a study of :
â olidation system as practiced in
arge business centers. ''hi:
turned to San Francisco ab.mt
I'ago. His report was s<> f.itis
â that the dealers most interested i ,
began to work up h sentlnient ,'
of the foundation of a big com- | 1
'he crystallization of their labor I :
lirection was witnessed at yes- '
terday's meeting.
It is estimated that 40.000 gallons of j
milk are daily consumed in Sar. Fran- ,
cisco, of which 10. 00^ are supplied by
M.irin County. The proposed -ompany â 
will include only San Francisco â lil'K- '
men. liut "n account of the large
amount <>f milk furnished by Ma'rin
County any consolidation without the
co-operation of the dairymen of this
county is practically a visionary
scheme.
It is oftener the rule than the excep- j
tion in San Francisco that the wagons j
of three or four companies supply milk
to families in the same block; in fact, it
sometimes occurs that, two or three
different milk concerns supply milk to !
different families living in the same
house. Th.-- plan of consolidation will
change all this, for only one wagon will ;
supply the people of each district, or
regular route. This will do away with
the plan whereby a wagon of one com
pany curries milk all around the city,
while perhaps the wagons of two or
three other companies will at the same j
lime encompass nearly the same dis- j
trict, the customers living in the same J
house or only a door apart. The amount I
<<( profit shared by each firm will de
pend upon the relative number of the
employes hired, wagons and stock sub
scribed nd customers obtained.
It will thus be seen that the move- j
ment toward consolidation of interests!'
into one large company is confined j
to Pan Francisco, but while this la i rue, |
it all depends upon the dairymen of j
Alameda, San Mateo and Marin coun- !
ties whether or not the milkmen can'
carry out their intended plans. If the ]
company should be formed and a few j
milkmen refuse to enter, these Vefrac- j
tory firms could greatly hinder the j
operation of the company provided they j
could secure a milk supply, and it is to i
do away with this obstacle that the as
sistance and co-operation of the dairy
men is asked. What the promoters of '
th" intended, company wish, therefore, '
is to secure contracts with all the '
dairymen of â  , meda, San Francisco, j
San Mateo and .Marin counties to give j
it their entire milk supply as long as!
the company is willing to pay as much
for the milk .is any firm not a member.
If the dairymen all enter into this
agreement any firm with the temerity
to compete with its gigantic opponent!
would soon find itself financially throt- i
tied-. Here is where the. monopolistic ele
ment enters. II no outside firm could
obtain: a sufficient supply of milk to â¢
carry on a business, and, therefore, the
company should have no competition,
it could regulate the prk>e of the fluid
to suit Its own notions.
In the counties named there are
I nut 100 dairymen, representing a cap- \
ital of perhaps $1,000,000. Negotiations
with the other dairymen have been j
carried to a point whero the signing of j
contracts is about all that remains to :
be done, but the dairymen of Marin \
County have not reached a definite!
conclusion, though it is more than 1
probable that they will come to an am- '
icahle agreement with the promoters!
of the great undertaking. M. T. Frei
las is the wealthiest dairyman in the
county and owns three ranches, from i
which fiOO gallons of milk are daily
shipped to the metropolis, In addition j i
be owns stock on several other ranches :
and is interested In the shipment of
about as many more gallons from these.

"I was informed of tho plan of con-
BOlidation some time ago and had the

is little doubt that from many stand
points it would be a srood thinp for the
San Francisco dealers. If J conclude

OF THE AMAZON.
Remarkable Cruise of the American Gun
boat Wilmington in South America.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
BUENOS AYRES. June 16. â The Rio Janeiro papers publish full accounts of the exploration journey on
the Amazon made by the United States gunboat Wilmington. Manaos, where her arrival provoked a
meeting of protest, is situated about a thousand miles from the mouth of the river. The people there
never saw a foreign man-of-war, nor thought it possible for her to reach such a distant point, but the Wilming
ton has gone farther still and has steamed up the Solimoes River until Iquitos, the Peruvian town made famous
by the separatist movement, was reached. The Wilmington has thus advanced about twenty-five hundred
miles into the interior of South America and has reached almost as far as the Cordilleras, a distance of only a
few hundred miles from the Pacific.
NEARLY fifty years ae>> Lieuten
ants Herndon and Gibbon of th<
United States navy made the
trip from the Pacific to the
Atlantic, starting from Lima,
crossing the Cordilleras and thence
partly by river, partly by land, fol
lowed the Amazon and its tributaries
down to Para, at the mouth of the
Amazon. The expedition was by the
order of the Secretary of the Navy,
with the object of exploring the Ama
zon valley, and the journey of 471" miles
was begun May 13, 1861, and ended
May 1. 1852.
Twenty-seven years later Commander
Thomas O. Selfridge was sent In the
Enterprise to make a survey of the
Madeira, which joins the Amazon
eighty-seven miles from th.-> tatter's
mouth. This expedition was made in
ONE MAN'S BURDEN.
three months and reached IT>OO miles,
or up to the Falls of San Antonio, the
head of the navigation of the Madeira
RivÂ« r.
Considerable difficulty and many
hardships were met with, owing chiefly
to th' j poor condition of the machinery
of the Enterprise; there were frequent
breakdowns, and the draft of over four
teen feet made th^ stirvey very diffi
cult from the ship, and the last 500
mi!< s were made from a sfrMMn launch.
A short time !>e?or< the survey had
been completed Commander Selfrkige
was overhauled by a Brazilian naval
officer, notifying him that the Madeira
was nol open to foreign ships of war,
and that the Governor of the province
requested that the Enterprise should
return to the Amazon. Commander
Selfridge explained his orders from the
' Lnited States Navy Department, ask
; ing the Governor to Rrant the permis
( sion of proceeding with the work of
i survey, and at thp same time agreeing
; to withdraw his ship In tho event of
the Governor's refusal. While the naval
officer delivered the message to the
Governor, Selfridge completed his sur
vey, and the consent for surveying: not
tjging granted, the Enterprise grace
fully dropped down the river and ar-
I rived sspic y at Para.

CLOSER WATCH
ON CABLEGRAMS
FROM MANILA
Aguinaldo Personally Leads
a Disastrous Attack on
American Troops.
NEW YORK, June 16.â A World's Washington
special says : The President is determined
to continue to enforce the censorship of
private and press dispatches at Manila. Within a
few days he has intimated forcibly to General
Corbin that too much information is being made
public from the War Department. General Otis
is in supreme authority over the Manila censor
ship, and it is not within the War Secretary's
province to order its abatement-
Newspaper correspondents are forbidden by
General Otis to file press reports from Hongkong,
and are warned that if they evade censorship by
this method their "usefulness to their papers
will cease immediately." Colonel Thompson,
the censor, in a private letter to an officer here,
writes : "My duties are exceedingly trying."
MANILA. June 16.â After cutting
the railroad and telegraph at
Apalit. seven miles south of San
Fernando, for the purpose of
severing connection with Manila, lit
rebels attacked General MacArthur'a
lines at San Fernando at 4:30 this
morning. They met with an unexpect
edly warm reception and were re
pulsed with a loss of seventy-five killed,
thirty prisoners ana many wounded.
The rebel force, estimated to have
numbered 5000 men, advanced stealth- :
ily from the jungle north of the city
and then divided with the evident pur- i
pose of surrounding the Americans.
The ..utposts of the lowa regiment I
discovered the enemy and retired to
their lines, where the entire division
waited in an entrenched position. The
Kansas and lowa regiments received
the first shock of the attack. Reserv
ing their fire until the enemy was with- ,
in 600 yards, the first volley of the I
Americans hit the rebels, who returned j
the fire wildly, the rest of th^ir line
tailing to advance. The Americans,
who thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of j
the situation, awaiting an attack he
hind breastworks, sallied forth and the !
insurgents thereupon turned and flÂ°d

wounded, and the majority of them are

sans and Montanans and General
Hale's brigade, the Seventeenth â Regi
ment and the lowa Regiment, consti
tuted the force engaged.
Aguinaldo is reported to have per
sonally conducted tho attack and pre
parations were made for several days
to bring forward troops from Candaba
and others from Dagupan wore trans
ported by rail. Along the front of the
Kansas Regiment thirty-nine rebel
dead were counted.
The first news of the Filipino ad
vance was reported by a telegraph
operator who was sent to the bridge
at Apalit to ascertain the cause of a
break in one of tho wires. He was
compelled to beat a hasty retreat under
fire.
A Spanish officer who has been a
prisoner in the hands <>f the rebels and
who was released by Aguinaldo has
come through our lines to Manila. He
claims tn have been a witness of the
assassination of <;onera l Luna. Ac
cording to his story the relations be
tween the two Filipino leaders had
been strained to the breaking point be
cause of I, una's attempts to assume
control of affairs and the final rupture
was forced by Aguinaldo issuing secret
orders to the provisional governments.
Luna thereupon notified Aguinaldo de
manding copies of the documents and
Aguinaldo replied curtly that Luna
was a general of the army and that
the civil government did not concern
him.
Luna, on opening the reply at his
headquarters in the presence of his offi
cers, exclaimed hotly: "He will be
lead to-morrow." One officer, who was
riendly to Aguinaldo, hastened to warn
;im, and Aguinaldo called together
twenty trusted soldiers, fellow-towns
men of his, and stationpd them around
his house, with instructions te kiil any
one attempting to enter, regardless of
rank.
Luna appeared the next day and saw
Aguinaldo at the window. A member
of the guard said: "Aguinaldo has
gone to inspect the troops."
Luna then exclaimed: "You are a
liar!" drew his revolver, struck the
guard and tried to force nn entrance
into the house. Before he could use his
revolver one of the guards bayonetted
him and shot him in the back and oth
ers stabbed him. In all h<=- had twenty
wounds. Luna's aid de camp was killed
in the same way.
The Spaniard's story has not entirely
dispelled the doubts of Luna's death
and bets that he is alive have been
made at the clubs. Some people think
Aguinaldo hns tak^n pains to send this
Spaniard here with his story, in fur
therance of snmfe diplomatic scheme,
while others suspect Aguinaldo has
been assassinated by Luna's men.
Since the Americans withdrew from
â¢ 'andaba recently, the rebels have re
turned and have wreaked vengeance
upon those who befriended the Ameri
cans. They slaughtered the natives
who surrendered the town and dis
played their heads on poles in the pub
lic square.
The hostile natives of Oohu are more
menacing, ilail advices say hostilities
against the Americans have begun
there. Colonel Hammer, the American
commander, has asked for reinforce
ments and four companies <>f the Ten
nessee regiment have been sent to him
from Hollo. The Nebraska regiment
lias been ordered to sail for home early
next week.
LONDON", June 16.â The Filipino
Junta here says there is no truth in
the report circulated and cabled to the
; niter] States that Aguinaldo had been
issassinated.

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ONLY
CAUSE MORE FIGHTING
WASHINGTON, June 16.â Aguinaldo
and his advisers seem to have been en
couraged by the negotiations instituted
by the Philippine Commissioners to
believe that the Americans are weak
ening and are anxious for peace. This
is the conclusion which is drawn in
some quarters from the recent aggres
sive attitude of the insurgents to the
south of Manila and from the attack
made upon General Mac Arthur to-day
to the north of the city.
The general Philippine situation was
discussed at the Cabinet meeting to
day, but as far as can be learned there
is no disposition on the part of the
President to call for volunteers or to
send General Otis a larger force than
the men which he will have when
the present plans are carried out.
It has been suggested that the recent
aggressive attitude of the Insurgents
may have been brought about by an
idea that the American troops could
not fight during the rainy season. If
this Is true Aguinaldo has been given
some object tensions which may make
him more crreful in the future, for
both to the south of Manila and in to
day's light at San Fernando his men
have been driven back with a much
more sever;* loss than they have been
abin to Inflict on the Americans.
It is hoped here that General Otis is
correct In his belief that to-day's at
tack was under the personal direction
of Vguina)''o, as in that event his
prestige would probably suffer from
his defeat.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUKE IT, 1399.
ACCUSED OF HAVING
ROBBED AN INVALID
Nurse's Tale of Masked Men and
Robbers Laughed At by the
Police.
SACRAMENTO, June 16.â Chief of Po
lice Dwyer to-night caused the Imprison
ment of a professional nurse named Rob
ert Mills on suspicion of having 1 robbed
his patient, James McGregor, an old man
and a paralytic, while the latter was
asleep. The circumstances are remark
able. Before daybreak this morning: the
police were notified that McGregor's home
at 1315 Fourth street had been entered by
two masked men, carrying pistols, and [
that one of them covered the nurse with a |
revolver while the other rifted a bureau
drawer of |500, which had been placed
there by Mrs. McGregor a couple of days
fore. The police obtained this story
from Mills, the nurse, who added that be- '
fore leaving by the front window, by I
which they had entered, the masked in
truders relieved him of his wealth also,
amounting to a few dollars and a dis
abled timepiece. To round off the story
nicely Mills said he heard the clatter of
horses' hoofs as the robbers sped away In .
the darkness.
Mills' story was deemed to be lacking
in the element of realism when the police
after prolonged scrutiny, failed to find
any fresh tracks of men or horses, and
the doubts which the tale provoked were
not dissipated when Mrs. McGregor and
a young woman who were asleep overhead !
declared that they had not been awak
ened by the alleged visit of the burglars
downstairs.
Mills was once a trained Mir^ at the
Railroad Hospital in this city.. He was
dismissed by the Buperintendem, Dr. T.
\V. Huntingdon, on suspicion fi having
attempted to bury some propeyy on the
grounds. The suspicion against him in
the present case is strengthened by the
fact that when Mrs. McGregor placed the
SSOO in the drawer she confided the fact
to him, so that in case of lire, as she told
him, he would be able to save the money. |

mother saying that we had been offered
$500,000 for the mine and that Mr. Frue
had decided to sell it. 1 have a third in
terest In it. She sent me a check for $2000
and told me to start home at once. I
went to Mr. \\'i be'r and asked him 1o re
lease me. He was very pleasant about it,
hut he refused. 1 offered him $1000 to re
lease me, but he said he could not chanjrs
his plans and he did not see why I could
not play this season and then go back
home. I don't know what I shall do, but
I hope I can arrange matters with Mr.
Weber."

Alleged Breach of Etiquette at Ascot
Course Which the American.
Jockey Stoutly
Denies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Juno 16.â The Star to-day
says: "After the racing yesterday (at
Ascotj Sloan appeared on the lawn
and a waiter accidentally upset a glass
of liquor over Sloan's clothing. The
latter instantly rose from his chair and
struck the waiter in the face with a
champagne bottle, inflicting several
wounds. No doubt the affair will be
hushed up, but it was the most un
provoked assault ever witnessed."
The Evening -News, referring to
Sloan's assault on the waiter without
giving any name, says:
"He was the guest of a member of
the Sports' <'lub. The waiter was so
injured that he was removed to the
hospital in a cab. All the witnesses
cried 'Shame,' and ladies struck at his
assailant with parasols. As there is
only one jockey now holding a license
v. ho could be guilty of such a cowardly
and repulsive act while the guest of a
member of the club it would be super
fluous to give his name. The immedi
ate duty of the Jockey Club is to in
stitute Inquiries and if the facts are
as stated to forthwith withdraw the
jockey's license."'
Talking about the matter with a rep
resentative of the Associated Press to
day. Tod Sloan said:
"The papers have largely exaggerated
the iiffair on Ascot lawn. A waiter was |
j very drunk when I happened on the j
! lawn with some friends; and he grew
insulting to my friends and myself, and
a friend said if he continued so doing
he would hit him. The waiter disap
peared art. that moment, and I re
marked: 'Now, when he returns, he will
upset the table' Sure enough, he did
i so, spilling the entire contents over me.
< >ne man struck him and his linger ring !
cut the waiter's mouth. 1 being the |
only man known, the people said: 'Oh,
Sloan did it.' and seeing the blood, they
said I had used a bottle.
"As to the Jockey Club taking action
; in the matter, as has been reported,
there is no truth whatever in the story,
for they know that I have told them
I the exact truth as to the fellow's ac
â¢ tion, as l was not concerned In striking |
him at all."

NEW YORK. June 16.â The New Yorks for
feited a game to the Brooklyn* this afternoon
in the second inning, when Hip Brooklyn* were
at the hat, the score at the time being ~> to 1
In favor of the Brooklyna. Seymour, in the
second Inning, sent a straight one over the
plate. Umpire Burns called it a "ball." Sey
mour and Warner threw up their hands. â  War
ner wns immediately removed. Then, came
Glenson, and this left the home team In' a
hopeless condition. Wilson went in to catch.
i Coakley, a pitcher, replaced Gleason, and Fos
ter went to short. The first hall pitched by
Seymour was a strike, but Wilson stepped to
one side and the ball came close, to .Umpire
Burns. He promptly removed Wilson from the
game for what he claimed was a deliberate
move to allow the ball to hit him. This caused
another row and Gleason and Warner were
ordtrod off the grounds. They did not so
promptly i enough to suit' Burns and he de
clared the game forfeited. The forfeiture
places the Xew York Club liable to $1000 line,
which must be paid to the Brooklyn Club.
President Ebbets of the Brooklyn Club said
after the game that he notified President Young
of the league before the New York- Brooklyn

Both teams left for the West to-night.

HOW TRUSTS HAVE
HURT THE NATION'S
TRAVELING SALESMEN
President Dowe of the League
Says Many Are Discharged
and Salaries Reduced.
WASHINGTON, June 16.â The In- J
dustiial Commission began its session
to-day by the examination of Janvs H.
Post of Brooklyn, a representative of
the Mollenhauer Sugar Company and
tlie National Sugar Company of New
York.
Mr. Post, referring to a list of sugar
prices, covering the past nine years,
showed that the margin between raw
and refined sugar had lluctuated With
the revision of the tariff and the en
trance of competing companies in the
field. The standard price of refined
sugar, he said, was fixed daily by the
American Sugar Kenning Company,
and as a rule these prices were followed
by the Independent refineries. Mr.
Post said that as a general proposition
ho thought the American Sugar defin
ing Company had influenced conditions
for the good of the country.
"Do you think," asked .Mr. natch
ford, "that It would be a good thing
for the American company to be in en
tire control of the field?"
-No," said Mr. Post. "I think the
entire control of an article of universal
consumption in the hands of any one
set of men would be a very dangerous
power." , . Â
"That is what the trust aims at,
said Mr. Ratchford, "according to Mr.
Havemeyer's own statement."
"The business might get into hands
of men not so broad-minded as Mr.
Hav.meyer," said the witness.
Mr Post denied that either the Na
tional or the Mollenhauer companies
were connected in any way with the
American Helming Company. At the
present price of raw sugar the margin
between raw and refined sugar was 60
cents per hundred pounds before the re
finer began to realize a profit. Mr.
Post said that in past years his refin
eries have used Cuban cane sugar al
most altogether, but since the great re
duction in the Cuban output they had
been forced to rely largely on European
beet sugar, principally German and
Austrian. The European refined sugar
was cheaper to produce, than the Am
erican, but not of so good a quality. Of
Imported raw sugar the American rÂ«
finers had got large quantities from
the Philippines.
Regarding the effect of the sugar
trust on the price of raw sugar witness
said he thought the presence of one
great buyer in the field had tended to
keep down the prices, but he did not
think the trust could keep down the
price more than one-sixteenth of a ceni
a pound, and that for only a portion
of each season.
(m inquiry as to the affidavit plan of
selling to wholesale grocers witness
said that it had recently been aban
doned. In many places grocers were
cutting the price of sugar and selling it
at a loss. Mr. Post said he war. sorry
for th,> grocers, but it wes a matter of
little Interest to the refiner. The re
finers allowed the grocers a profit of
three-sixteenths of a cent a pound,
which was as little as they cou'.d afford
to handle it for. Free sugar from Cuba.
witness :-.ii<i. would wipe oui American
raw sugar, both beet and cane, in the
next five years.
During the afternoon the commission
heard a statement from P. E. Dowe of
New York, ). resident of thÂ«^ Commer
cial Travelers' National League. Mr.
Dowe said the opinion of the commer-
Cial men at large was that the trusts
were a menace to the community. He
placed the 1 raveling salesmen in the

stances lie said: ,
"The National Enameling and
Stamping Company, which depends for
its raw material upon the American
Tinplate Company, has -thrown a great
many out of employment, and tftose
retained have hud their salaries re
duced. The great tobacco combina
tions threw out about 3000 salesmen,
the Continental Tobacco Company tele
graphed the discharge of 3;>o in one
day; the baking powder trust has dis

men 1 knew of two salesmen dis
. barged by the trust who were l<>â¢> e ' -
ly in the employ of the Cleveland Bait
ing Powder Company, one receiving^a
salary of $5000 a year, the other $4500.
Their routes, with those of other dis
charged salesmen, are covered by-one
agent at $1S a week. The bicycle trust
will throw out 600 salesmen gradually
and will cut down agencies in e\ er\
city. The chair trust will affect imme
diately more than 500 salesmen by cut
ting them out Of the line. ttÂ«iÂ«Â«
"One man writes me that the I mon
Bag and Paper Company has thrown
out of employment hundreds of sales
men. The number of salesmen out of
work because of the Lnited States
Rubber Company is 300; the salesmen
retained have been reduced to >a salary
averaging. I am informed, $1300 a year.
The American Tinplate Company cut
off about 9D out of every 1W salesmen.
The American Steel and Rod < .',' m V >an >'-
I have been told, discharged 300 com
mercial travelers in one day. In giv
ing these estimates I am not consid
ering the office force thrown out
through trusts. Sugar and coffee mon
opolies have thrown out 1000 salesmen:
the average reduction in salary of those
retained is SIOOO a year, 2u per cent
only of the old force being retained in
the house position. The Standard Oil
Company employs fewer salesmen
than any other concern in the mercan
tile world of one half of its capital.
Mr Dowe said the trust combinations
had raised the prices of the commodi
ties they controlled from 5 to 100 per
cent In almost every instance except
coffee and sugar. In these they were
still fighting for control of the field. He
said his figures In this line were abso
lutely correct, being from reliable com
mercial acquaintances. The examples
he gave were: Iron pipe, over 100 per
r>-vf tinware and enameled ware,
about 33 per cent; brass goods, 60 per
cent; chair trust, just formed, will ad
vance prices 30 per cent; rubber over
shoes (United States Rubber Com
pany), advanced prices 14 per cent on
May r American Tin Plate, advanced
prices ' something like 30 per cent:
newspaper, % to ft cent a pound: book
papers. 5 and 10 per cent; in common
aoap 25 cents to 60 cents a box; job
bers and manufacturers of clocks have
advanced the wholesale prices on ac
count of advance of metals. 60 per cent;
all metal goods have been advanced;
brass pins. 25 per cent: pipes and
brushes, 12ft per cent; combs, l^z per
cent; ribbons. 10 per cent. The, um
brella, trust failed four years ago. but
it advanced prices while in exister.ee,
and after its break up the retun to
legitimate and healthy prices caused a
loss to the retailer through the stock
on hand.
This witness concluded by saying
that before leaving New York he had
been warned by an acquaintance, a '
lawyer, indirectly connected with some
of the trusts, that he was doing a !
dangerous tning in speaking before the !
commission, as he was liable to "be j
crushed like a caterpillar."

AT WHITE FRIARS CLUB
Senator Depew Speaks in Happy Vein
at the Good Feeling Between
England and America.
LONDON, June K>. â The dinner which
the White Friars 'Club gave Mark
Twain this evening at the Hotel Cecil
was a remarkable tribute to the author
;iinl ;it the same time to the friendly
relations existing between Great Brit
ain and the United States. Each >i
the speakers, among whom were the
Very Rev. S. Reynolds Hole. United
States Senator Chauncey M. Depew and
Poultney Bigelow, dwelt upon this
theme. Mr. Depew, after some light
bantering and a tribute to Mark Twain.
struck a serious note, which received
hearty indorsement. Alluding to the
chflnge "f sentiment in America pro
duced by Great Britain's attitude and
action during the Hispano- American
war. he said:
"When Captain CoÃhlan of the Ka
leigh returned from .Manila he told us
about the attitude of Admiral yon Died

Immortalite, and he told usâ what we
all in our hearts already knewâ that
the European pov ers. save England.
sympathized with our enemies, and
that it was only their knowledge that
Kngland would support us morally and
actively, if necessary, which prevented
their interference (applause), and it
was this knowledge which made it pos
sible for me. when addressing a politi
c;W gathering of 20,000 people in Amer
ica the other day, to take the Stars and
Stripes in one hand and the Union
Jack in the other and not to hear one
dissenting voice in that vast audience."
A fitting climax v/as given at this
point, when Sir Edward Chichester,
who had been prevented by another en
gagement from coming earlier, entered
the room and was greeted with three
cheers.
i^ir Rdward Chichester expressed his
admiration for Admiral Dewey and his
oftit ers and for the American Bailors
generally. lie said: "I was very glad
to be at Manila, and the visit increased
nay v sp. --.-i for tlv- Americsan character.
After aii. blood Is thicker than water,
but 1 must not go <>n, for a friend of
mine. Captain. Coghlan, got into trouble
through talking the other day."

From this stage of the proceedings
Mark Twain and Captain CJMfthester
shared the honors of the evening, every
body desiring to phako hands with both.

tura Elected Grand
President.
.
STOCKTON, June 16.â The thir
teenth Grand Parlor of the N l
tive Daughters of the Golden
West ended to-night with a bril-
liant ball at Agricultural Pavil
ion. The delegates have worked hard
for th<* promotion of the x lof their
beloved order and have succeeded in
dispatching a vast amount of business,
much of which related to the Interior
workings of th^ parlors. Not a single
instance of discord has marred the pro
ceedings and th<- delegates separated
more warmly attached to their organi
zation than ever before.
The grand officers were selected a'l
this morning's session. The nomina
tions had been made last evening in
order to expedite this important busi
ness, and as the list was not long it
was expected it would take but a short
time to decide "n those whc were to
preside over the destinies of the order
during the coming year. The rivalry
for honors became quite pronounced.
however, as the election approached
and the discussions took up some time.
Mrs. fora K. Sifford of Ventura waÂ«>
selected without opposition to succeed
Mrs. Lena Hilke Mills as grand presi
dent of the ord^r. The principal con
tesi came, as was expected, upon t*>>*
grand vice presidency, which is the
stepping stone to the higher office.
Mrs. Emma Gett of Sacramento and
Mrs. Genevieve P>akT of San Fran
cisco w er" the candidates for this
honor and so many enthusiastic friends
did each have that Mrs. Getl is said
to have won by only seven votes. It
seems that some of the friends of each
candidate became so active that a ru
mor started that ill feeling was en
erendered. but this was not true. Mrs.
Baker made the best refutation of this
charge when she arose at the con
clusion of the balloting, and. after
thanking her friends, congratulated her
successful opponent. assuring t the
members that she would be just as ac
tive in the order Lfl ever ..nd predict
ing a successful administration of the
office by Mrs. Gett.
Mrs. Georgia C. Ryan of San Fran
cisco was elected to succeed herself as
grand secretary. Mrs. Ryan is an effl
â  officer and had no opposition.

SOME PROGRESS
ON ARBITRATION
Delegates Get Time to
Deliberate.
GERMANY MAY YET YIELD
PROSPECT OF ESTABLISHING
PERMANENT TRIBUNAL.
The Representatives of the United
States Object to Its Location at
The Hague, the S=at of a
Monarchy.
Preoial LMspau-h to Th* Tall.
NEW YORK, June 16.â A spe
efal to- the Sun from The Hague
says: The Catholic members of
the conference have returned
their Invitations as a protest
againsi the exclusion of the Pope
from the conference.
THE HAGUE, June 16.â The drafting;
committee of the arbitration tribunal
scheme, which should have met to-day,
adjourned its sittings to Monday next.
The ostensible reason for the adjourn- '
ment was the absence of Baron Estiur- j
n^Hes de Constant of the French dele
gation, who drew up the minutes. It
is possible, however, that the delegates j
had not received sufficient instructions
from their respective governments to |
make further progress.
The delegates do not regret the oppor
tunity of a few more days' time to de
liberate. The difficulty now chiefly con
sists in reconciling a scheme of tht>
other powers with the view of Ger
many, but the prospect is more hope
ful.
Even if no agreement should be
leached an arbitration organization
will nevertheless be arranged and will
remain open to such of the powers as
are not able to sign now. In the mean
time every effort will be made to mccl
thi- Herman views.
The naval section committee met to
day and received the report of Count
Soltlk. A majority of the section will
favor the prohibition of explosives in
t'-niied to spread asphyxiating gases
and the use of rams on warships. The i
questions of limiting gun caliber, armor
plates and the form of powder remain
undecided, pending the receipt of in- >.
structi(,ns from the various govern- I
menta The report will be submitted!
first to the committee and then to the |
conference.
LONDON, June IT. â The correspond
ent of the Daily News at The Hague,
who asks whether the Kaiser hem found
his road to Damascus, says: "A Cabi
net messenger arrived here this morn
ing from Berlin with fresh instructions
to Count Munster. They were of such
a nature that several delegates re
marked that a new situation had been
created thereby and they must write
home for fresh instruction?. One said:
â¢Arbitration is getting on swimmingly.'
Possibly as the result of these instruc
tions the German delegates have be
come more fidgety.
"Twelve of the leading delegates took
luncheon with Mr. White of the Ameri
can delegation yesterday and discussed
the proposed central bureau of a per
manent tribunal. Sir Julian Pauncefote
suggested that the control of the bu
reau should be vested in the Dutch
Government, but the Americans raised
the curious objection that as Holland
is a monarchy such an arrangement
would hurt the feelings of the citizens
of a free republic.
"Sir Julian Pauncefote thereupon
suggested making The Hague the seal
of a permanent bureau ((imposed of
the resident Ministers of foreign states.
Mr. White suggested that the Dutch
Minister of Foreign Affairs should pre
side over the bureau, and to this Sir
Julian assented."'
Fighting for Change of Venue.
wool >LAN D. June 16.â Attorney Gen
eral Ford has filed a second amended de
mand for a change of venue to Sacra
mento County of the case of Yolo County
vs. K. P, Colgan, State Controller, to re- j
cover fees for collecting State taxes. The I
motion tor a change of venue was denied
a few days ago by Judge Gaddls upon the
ground that the pleadings were faulty, j
(n the affidavit of merit of Mr. < 'olgan I
he stated that he had presented his de
fense to counsel and had been advised
that he had a pood defense. In order to
romply with the law the affidavit should
have stated that Mr. Colgan had present
ed both sides of the case to his counsel.
The second amended affidavit complies
with the law in that regard. Judge
Gaddis will rehear the motion on June 7.

. Fire Destroys Hay.
WOODLAND, June 16.â A fire, the oripin
of which is unknown, burned about thirty
tons of hay belonging to Joseph GHgulere,
near Cachevllle, this morning. The heat
is intense, grain straw is as dry as tinder

INDICTMENT OF

Report Made by Grand
Jury on Riots.

TRAGIC DEATH OF MIKE JOHN-

Interesting Argument in the Case of
the Mullan Mirror in Which Both
Martial and Civil Law-
Figure.
Sriecial Dispatch t.. Tho Call.
WAI. L.\<-K. Idaho, June 16.â This af
ternoon the Grand Jury reported as
follows:
"In accordance with your charge we
have carefully, examined Into all cases
growing out of the riots of April 29 In
Shoshone County, and after mature de
liberation have found true bills against
all participants who have been Identi
fied. A large number of others who are
identified as participants, but -whose,
true name? are unknown to us, have
been indicted under fictitious names.
We would recommend that owing to th;>
fact that large numbers of parties in
dicted are not in custody that after
tiling the indictments be not published,
unless so ordered by the court.
"The matter of the death of Mike
Johnson tihÂ«' lunatic drowned at Ward
ner Saturday) vis further presented to
us. bumi >>n careful investigation we find
no evidence of death from unlawful,
violent or external causes, therefore we
have Ignored the same. There being no
further business before us we ask to be
discharged."
Accompanying the report was a large
mass of indictments. There were about
fifty, but many contained numerous
names, so the number indicted will re
main unknow n.
The whole afternoon was spent by
the court listening to arguments in the.
case of Stewart versus Sinclair. The
defense moved to quash the complaint
and the plaintiffs for an order to pro
cure sufficient help to take possession
of the type from the Mullan Mirror.
Both motions were argued at the same
time, as they were so intimately con
nected. Defendants argued that mar
tial law and civil law could both ex
ist at the same time, each being su
preme in its way. Plaintiff argued that
both kinds of law could not be co
existent; it martial law prevailed civil
courts could not act. _,

party in which was John Johnson, â¢ as- j

Company and a son of one . -l' he dead, j
After great difficulty the position of the ;
fire was located and a body of volun- j
teers attacked the (tames with water.
This work as carried on vigorously
for several hours, when it was found
that the extent of the tire and the dim
culties of lighting it rendered efforts '
useless. i
Up to ..is evening the efforts of the
lire fighters had not been effectual in
extinguishing the (lames.

almost blinded with the smoke that was !
pouring in volumes upon them. One
of the men â â > as found with his hands j
around a post McCormick was found j
with a handkerchief across his mouth i
and a waistcoast over his head. He :
probably went into one of the rooms i
to s:ive a mate, but the damp had be- â¢

GOLD FROM THE
RICH KLONDIKE
More Than a Ton Being
Brought Out.
â Â«
MANY MERCHANTS RETURNING
COME FBOM DAWSON CITY TO
BEPLENISH SUPPLIES.
Some Fabulously Paying Clfiims Be
irg Worked in the Vicinity of
Dawson Will Yield Many
Millions This Year.
: Dlspatcfc to The Call.
SKAGUAY, Juno 13 (via Seattle,
Wash., June 16). â A large amount of
gold dust and nuggets was landed at
White Horse Rapids last Friday, June
), from the first '.three steamers to reach ,
that po-lnt from Dawson City. Over
one ton of it was officially checked off \
by the officers at White Horse when |
making the transfer from steamer to
steamer. The remainder was divided in
packages ranging from ten to seventy- â¢
live pounds, carried by the more than
thirty passengers of the three boats.
They were in all sorts of odd pack- :
ages and with no attempt at conceal- ;
ment. Owing to the low stage of the
water on the lakes and rivers it was irn- I
possible for the small steamers from i
Bennett to reach them before Sunday,
and the first lot of sixty-live was landed
in Bennett yesterday by the Nora and i
reached Skaguay last evening. An
other lit of over 100 reached here at 2 I
/(.lock this morning and the remainder
will get here some time to-day.
The consensus of opinion gathered
from almost every man aching Skag- i
nay was to the effect that the output
if the Klondike in the past year would
be between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000.
Fftevn millions, which will nearly
iouble last year's output, will be found
to be good figures to gamble on.
Frank Slavin, the prize-fighter, has
a sack weighing fifty-four and a half
pounds.
Oscar Odin and his partner, Jack
Raymond, had . 200 pounds between
I hem.
Louis Allanberry struggled under 106 j
pound cf dust and $SOOO In bills.
Thomas McLaric of Shelton, Wash., '
has 120,000 .in dust, William Rogers
J3OOO and Joe Clerkln $5000. Every ho- '
tel safe in Bkaguay last night was
crammed full of gold dust, with a !
watchman on guard all night, and as I
these safes could not accommodate all :
who had gold the safes of the several \
merchants had to be called into requi- |
sition, and the largest of these were
taxed to I heir utmost.
This gold is brought out largely by I
me chants, with only a. few miners who
have been in the Klondike all the way
irom a year to three years. Only about j
half of it is from the winter's clean-up !
and- that from benching, as sluicing
had only about commenced when the
steamer left- Dawson about May 25.
Nelson A. Goucher, who has been
working No. 9 El Dorado, says that
thai famous creek will surpass all ex
pectations. No. 9, owned by Mercer-&
Demars, will clean up at least $200,000.
No. 17 El Dorado, he believes, will
prove to be the richest claim on the |
whole; Klondike. Mr. Peacock of Que- \
bee, -who owns a -interest, had j
thlrlvrseven m*n at work on it all win- |
ter and thÂ« â  clean-up- will be in the }
neighborhood of from $1,200,000 to $1,- |
500,000. n
< iii Professor Lippy's claim, No. 16 {
El Dorado, they quit drifting on March
i, as they bad more pay dirt out than j
they will be able to wash up this sea- j
son. The dirt is very rich. The results I
of this claim cannot be estimated, but
will be enormous.
A n tone's claim, No. 2 El Dorado, Is:
also -exceedingly rich, but no figures !
are given. E. VV. Ward of Newcastle,
Wash., who is on Bonanza, said when I
he left they were working rockers on
benches and sluicing had only fairly
begun. Not much work is being done
below Discovery, but great activity
prevails above it and the claims are |
showing up rich. Dominion Creek is j
going to make a good record and so is
Hunker, but it is too early yet to give
figures from any or' those creeks owing
to the distance and difficulties of the
trail to and from Dawson.
.Many of the men just come out are â 
merchants, who are here to replenish |
their stocks and get back again as soon
as possible, j
Peter Odin gives a good account of I
Gold Hill at the junction of El Dorado I
and Bonanza and says the results will
surprise many.
The exact figures of the actual out
put will never be known, for the reason
that every effort is being made to
evade the royalty and every trick and
device is being resorted to in order to
smuggle the dust out of the country.
Frank Slavin and his partners have
thirty-seven placer claims, most of
them good. There has been a lot of
prospecting for quartz, but no great
discoveries have been heard from.
Slavin Is going to New York and Lon
don. He and his partners have bonded
the Dome quartz proposition with a 1
London company and got $100,000 for
development work.
Among those who came in on the
early train with small tin boxes 01
sacks of gold was Mr. Preston, former
assayer here, who, besides his dust, has
a nugget weighing $88. - Among other
noted "heavy-weights are Stanley Mc-
Grade, I. Moen, W. F. Forget, Colonel
Green, N. G. Goucher, S. Clement, A. R.
cox. !â¢:.<â . Campbell and E. w! Morrill.
Clement, who owns No. IS above on
Bonanza, carries drafts exchanged in
Dawson for his gold, the aggregate of
which covers six figures.
The steamer* Columbian was wrecked
June '.i by striking a rock six miles be
low White Horse Rapids. She is a
total loss. The Columbian had a large
list of passengers, who were trans
ferred to other steamers.
The ice is still troublesome. The Nora
on her way down to White Horse went
through two miles of nine-inch ice on
Marsh T,nke. At Cariboo Crossing the
Nora passed three stranded steamers,
the- Australia, Clifford Sexton and
the Cleaner. The latter got Â«>ff short-

FEUD OF RIVAL
TEXAS FACTIONS
Renewal of Hostilities

Syeeia! Dlsnatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Texus. June 16.â Adjutant
Genera] Thomas Scurry returned tg-<lny
from Columbus, Texas, whero he has
been for tho pant several days Hiding the
force of rangers In preventing a renewal
of hostilities between the two factions of
that place. He reached there last Sunday
morning ant! found tho situation extreme
ly critical, on the day previous a whole
sale killing having been narrowly averted
through the bravery and quick action of
a member of the force of nuiKcrH.
A crowd of what Is known as the K< â¢â¢<â .
faction, were in a saloon. ah wort-, arm
â¢ d. and just as a party of tin-, opposing
faction came down the street, a gun of
one of the Recce band was accidentally
discharged. There was a rallying of
forces on both sides immediately. Ranger
Taylor was near the saloon and single
handed he .disarmed all the members of
both factions. The excitement in the
towi; was intense, all places of business
being closed in expectation of bloodshed.
Two more rangers were Bent for and
have reached the town. Every man ap
pearing on the street is searched and if
found to be carrying a weapon be is dis
arm eti
Adjutant General Scurry visited the
leaders of the two factions In their homes,
and finally induced ten of the principal
members of the Recce faction to leave
town. They left yesterday and it is
thought if they carry out their promise
to remain away there will be no further
trouble.
The feeling between the two factions la
an extremely bitter one. and the most
prominent and wealthy professional men
in the town never appear on the streets
without a bodyguard. This remarkable
feud commenced in ISBI, and has so far
resulted in the killing of six prominent
citizens of the town.
CAN DETECT FORCES
USING SMOKELESS POWDER
Professor Fessenden Invents a Tele-
scope That May Become Useful
in War.
PITTSBURG, Pa,, June IG.â Reginald A.
Fessenden, professor of electric engineer
ing at the Western University of Penn
sylvania, declares that with a telescope
which he is now perfecting soldiers can
detect the location of hostile forces using
smokeless powder. Secretary Alger thinks
enough of the claims of the inventor to
consider tile Invention. Special interest is
taken in the matter by the administration
because of the costly experience of the
American troops in Cuba and the Phil
ippines.
Chemicals in smokeless powder are such
as to produce a white Hash- which is in
visible to the naked eye in the daytime.
Professor Fessenden procured from the
arsenal here some cartridges chart/: )
with smokeless powder And became con
vinced the Hash could be made visible by
some agency that would cause a repro
duction on its surface of the powder (lash.
With the assistance of Professor F. V.
O. Wadsworth. director of the Allegheny
Observatory, he began experiments ijj
ascertain what wave colors the Hash
would produce upon various colored glass. 1
He finally found that glass of a reddish
brown shade produced the effect he want
edâthat of showing the flash as it would
appear nt night when a red flash can lÂ«e
noticed. He afterward constructed , i
telescope and eyeglasses for use accord
ing to the distance of the observer from
the gun.
For some time he has been in corre
spondence with the War Department of
ficials and will make a trip to Washington
Boon to explain his apparatus and make
tests before an examining board, which
will take action toward urging the pur
chase of Professor Fessenden's invention.
The professor regards the invention as a
secret of the nation and refuses to give
details as to the apparatus.' The profes
sor is the inventor of numerous electrical
appliances/and before coming to the uni
versity he worked under Edison.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PUEBLO, Col., June 16.â Final adjust
ment of wages at the Philadelphia
Smelter, the Guggenheim anti-trust
plant, was effected to-night, the men ac
cepting the scale of the company, with tha
exception that the lowest- Class of labor
will be paid $1 40 per day Instead of $1 32,
as offered by the company. The company
expects to be in full operation in all de
partments with 1200 men by June 20.
There Is no change at any of the other
plants.
DENVER, June 16.â The developments
of the past twenty-four hours in the
smelter strike have Deen decidedly encour
aging. Particularly la so the announce
ment from Pueblo that the employes ol!
the Philadelphia smelter have accepted
the latest wage schedule offered by *.he
company and that the great plant will be
working with a full complement of '.200
men by June 20. No tangible progress has
been made in the efforts to BMtle the dif
ferences between the American Smelting
and Refining Company and its men. but
a movement inaugurated to-day by Gov
ernor Thomas is looked upon with a good
deal of hope.
This afternoon Governor Thomas wrote
to ex-Governor Grant, the chairman of
the operating committee of the American
; Smelting and Refining Company, asking
i him if his committee would consent -to
: meet a committee of citizens not in .my
way Identified with the State Federation
of Labor nor with the smelting business,
to be chosen by Mayor Johnson and Him
self, and discuss the situation with -i
view of bringing aTjout a settlement of
the trouble. Mr. Grant readily consent?).]
to the proposition, and thÂ« Governor. in
conjunction with Mayor Johnson of thJa
city, named the following committee, who
promptly consented to serve: Former
Governor Alva Adams. William Church,
president of the Golden Pressed Brick
Company; J. K. Mullen, proprietor of the
Hungarian Mills; K. T. Jefferv. president
of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway;
Rev. Barton O. Aylesv/orth; president of
the State Agricultural College.
The committee will meet with the smel
ter officials at the office of the Governor
at the St alehouse at IJ:3O o'clock to-mor
row morning. While it Is said that they
have no definite plan in view, th.c mem
bers express the belief that the confer
ence will be productive, of good in soijie
way.
The Smelter Men's Union was in session
till a late hour to-night considering the
proposition of /President Coatea of the
State Federation of Labor, that a com
mittee be appointed to confer with the
operating committee of the company with
a view of effecting a compromise. The
company's committee, through its chair
man, former Governor J. B. Grant, re
fused yesterday to confer with the. ex
eeuitve board of the State Federation of
Labor, but expressed a willingness to
treat with its own workmen at any time.
The union, after a long discussion of the
matter, decided to put the matter In the
hands of the strike committee, which is
instructed to confer further with the ex
ecutive board of the Slate Federation of
bur before taking any action.
Ex-Governor Grant to-day said that the
company had no objection to the eight
hour shift proposition, and was wining
to pay the same scale now being paid by
the Boston anil Colorado. As the union
has' approved the action of the Boston
and Colorado's employes In accepting tills
scale, it is believed that a settlement with
the trust maybe made on that basis.

TUOLUMNE'S OLD
SETTLERS GATHER
Sonora the Scene of a
Reunion.
Special Dispatch to The i ill,
SONORA, June 16.â 1n the language
of a local paper "the pioneers of the ;
county, the ex-residents of the county
and their friends are here in honor of
the Tuolumne Reunion Association."
To the average Tuolumne citizen it
looks as if everybody is here. The town
I from one end to the other Is decked
with bunting. . Movable objects, ye
: hicles, horses, bicycles and human be- â ,
ings are decorated with the national
colors. To-morrow morning at 9 o'clock
, the celebration will begin properly, but
I it is already on.
This evening when the Sierra train
- pulled up to the depot it contained an
j excursion from San Francisco and in
" terniediate points. It was the first ex-
I cursion that ever entered Sonora and
will doubtless be the largest for years
to come. The people of the town and
county and the visitors already in were
:at the depot to meet the visitors. The
strangers were given a rousing wel
come, while on the surrounding hills
j dynamite was exploded in their honor.
A temporary stand had been erected
| near the depot, upon which to hold the
| first services of receiving the visitors.
| After music by the Tuolumne Cornet
Band the school children of Sonora,
numbering 350, sang an ode of welcome
composed by .Miss Carrie Inch, daugh
ter of County Recorder Inch. It is en
titled "Welcome, Tuolumne County
Pioneers." State Senator J. B. Curtin
delivered the address of welcome. He
said in part:
Ladles and gentlemen and old citizens of
ruolumne: upon me has devolved the
pleasant duty of bidding you each the
hearty and sincere welcome of the people
Of old Tuolumne, and It is one to which I
most cheerfully respond.
You come among us againâ of you
after many years in which have trans
â  pired many events, some of which will
gladden your hearts, and you will find
many changes which will sudden them
Tender memories will revert to kind old
, faces thai have passed to "that bourne
whence no traveler hath ever vet re
, turned," and the gold chain of friendship
will show, many a severed link; but you
i find among those who are still here and
among: the younger inhabitant:- the same
kind spirit of hospitality which pervaded
' the heart? of those, who have left us.
This occasion is one which we have all
â  looked forward to with pleasurable antici
-1 pation for many days, the realization of
â  which brings happiness to us all. The
bond of true friendship and sympathy ex
â¢ , Istlng between yourselves and our people
â¢ cannot fail to he renewed and bring you
' pleasure. , I am also aware that from the
immutable and unchanging laws of nature
[ after your day's journey you must feel
' some weariness, and therefore will make
a virtue, of necessity and not detain you
' longer by branching into complex and
profuse metaphors â or by adverting to
, events enshrined within your hearts, but
! will re-echo the sentiment of our people
' and extend to you one and all a fervent
and hospitable welcome and say to you
â¢ that our pleasure at your coming can only
, be marred by the regret that you cannot
always be with us. .".â â  â â¢
â  Walter Gallagher of San Francisco

MOORE IN THE

Outlaw Testifies in His

DRAMATIC SCENE IN COURT
ILLUSTRATES HIS ENCOUNTER
WITH KILBOY.
Nearly Floors Attorney Tyrrell While
Showing- How the Policeman
Had Rushed Upon
. iim.
Special. Dispatch to Tho Call.
NEVADA CITY, June Edward
: H. Moore's Ups have at last been un
sealed. The outlaw went on the wit
-1 ness stand to-day and attempted to'
show the jury why he should not be
'. hanged for the murder of Policeman
Kilroy. The lawyers shouted themselves j
hoarse so as to make him hear their ,
questions, although he used an ear j
! trumpet. At one .point his ' lawyer,
John R. Tyrrell, said:
"Show me just how Kilroy came at
.you and spoke when he grabbed you j
j by the shoulders the Instant before it
is alleged you shot him."
The prisoner sprang from his chair.
' He rushed like mad at the lawyer, who
| was not braced to withstand such an
assault and went staggering backward.
"You will not live to have me ar
rested!" lie 'yelled in the lawyer's ear,
j as his powerful hands crashed down
on that gentleman's shoulder and his
thumbs went up against the lawyer's
windpipe. â¢That." said Moore, "is the
' way Kilroy came after me."
He claimed it is the last of the en
; counter he remembers, for just then he
i felt a blow on the head. He could re
: member nothing of the firing of three
'â  bullets into Kilroy and of fleeing from
j the scene of the killing. He came to his
senses when wandering' in a stream of
! water near his cabin. He rushed into
( the cabin, got his shotgun, another pis
tol and his blankets and fled, fearing
if he stayed around he would be torn
to pieces by a mob. He added that he
| Hist knew on being caught nearly a
; month later in Contra Costa County
| that he had killed the officer.
Moore's story was incongruous and in
many respects at variance with what
the prosecution had shown.
At the reopening of court this morn
ing Sheriff Ve&le of Contra Costa
; County detailed the story of his capture
of Moore. He was o-n the train at Bay
Point. He saw an armed man coming
up the track. It was Ed Moore, the
crack shot of Nevada Cc-unty, carrying
a double-barreled shotgun at full cock
! and in a position to quickly bring it to
| his shoulder. Veale had a Winchester,
j and, Jumping from the train, he got
the drop first. Moore, seeing he was
cornered, threw down â  th*> gun and
. raised his arms. The little Sheriff told
; it all as quietly and modestly as he
I would say he was going to dinner, but
. even then it could not be otherwise than
dramatic In the extreme. ;.)['
This afternoon, when the prosecution
had rested. Lawyer Tyrrell made his
opening statement for the defense. He
said he would prove that Kilroy made
lan unwarranted and violent assault
upon Moore, whom he had long dogged
and sought to provoke into a display of
violence; that Moore, when he fired, be
; lieved he was about to be killed. He
j said he would show that Moore's
I father's uncle had died in an asylum for
; the insane; that he had an uncle in the
asylum at Reno, where he had been for
twenty-five years: that one of his male
1 cousins was an inmate of the Agnews
Asylum; that an aunt was crazy and
that his mother had died a raving
maniac. Moore" would be shown to have
been crazy for twenty years on various
subjects, one of which was that he was
I being constantly pursued by enemies
i who sought his life.
When Moore was sworn his direct tes- \
timony was clear and concise, and in
line with the double defense set up.
Then came a long and rigorous* cross
examination by District Attorney
Power.
When Moore went off the stand
George D. Buckley, an attorney, was
called, and the defense attempted to
show by him that Officer Kilroy was in
the habit of first clubbing people and
then arresting them, and that he had
so admitted when testifying- in court a
fÂ»w months before his death. Judge
Nllon ruled this evidence oui and court
adjourned until to-morrow.
JAPANESE MIDDIES

Boat Crew of the Hiyei Outrows the
Pick of San Bingo's Naval
Organization.
SAX DIEGO, Juno 16.â The Japanese '
training ship Illyeijlias had a great week
In port. It will leave to-morrow morning
with not only pleasant recollections of San
Diego and its people but with the scalp of
the Naval Reserves at the Hiyei's mast
head. Two or three lays ago some of the
athletic young men of the Naval fiat
talion challenged the Japs to a boatrace.
The Japanese scratched their heads and
did a lot of talking, finally accepting; the
challenge. It was agreed to race In six
oared cutters for glory only, the winning i
side to fly the flag of its opponents at the 'â â 
forepeak of its vesaei, the Hiyel or ihe
Pinta. It was also stipulated, by request
of the Japanese, that at the turning point
the crews should exchange boats to share
any advantage, either side might possess
The race came off this afternoon at 5:30
o'clock, the course being from the Hivei
to a point off the Pacific Coast Steamship ;
Company's wharf. a total distance, of two
miles. A thousand people iwere on the ;
Santa Fe wharf to witness it. The starter
was an officer of the Hiyei, and the judges
comprised officers from the Hiyei and the
Naval Battalion.
When the signal w:js given the reserves
shot ahead, but the Japanese soon came
up with them and held their own The
turning point was reached by the reserves
one second ahead 01 the Japanese, who
crossed the bow of the reserves' cutter
though thi' claim of foul was not al
lowed.
After the exchange of boats the Plnta's
cannon gave the signal for the return
and amid the cheers of the Hivel's crew
on the training ship arid the people on the
shore both cutters bent to their work
Slowly but surely the little Japanese
gained on the brawny reserves ana came
in ahead by two lengths, or five seconds
The result was received with the greatest
enthusiasm on the Hiyel. Soon afterward
the red sunburst of Japan was sen flying
on the Pinta. The Hiyei sails to-morrow
for Honolulu. ;; â¢â¢ ---â¢

Special Dispatch to The Call. ,
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 16.â 1n
consequence of labor troubles and the
new Government regulations which are
largely responsible for them, the Cana
dian salmon Industry in the West Is
practically paralyzed. Yesterday 2500
Indian fishermen of Rivers Inlet an I
Skeena River, 200 miles up the coast,
went out on strike.
The salmon season opened yesterday
morning. The Indians denim, I an
agreement for 10 cents a fish
â  season, and the canners will n
antee mor â  than *'> or 7 cents
most. While flsh are running
now, at the outset of the seaa
they have for several years, I
: canneries along the northern coa
'running to only about one-eighth tl
average capacity. The foreman â â .
ham's cannery arrived here this
ing to engage white men. but few
to be found. Wadham's canm
1 owned by an American. Out of 103
j boats, only ten of his iishing craft were
: out to-day.
The Indians B;iy positively they will
: not return to work unless th< j axe pai 1
10 cents a flsh. The canners, on the
i other hand, declare they cannot, run at.
a profit and pay that price.
While most of the fishermen In the
north are Indians, wb&< ntrol
the great trade oi tit.; ITraser River
canneries, where the season opens ten
days hence. Hundreds oi A .
i have come up .for the '
| vious years from as far sou:.,
. lard, and Canadian fishermen v. â¢
I tually in the minority. The new
eminent regulations make licenses
; pulsory. and they are issued to British,
subjects only. Three weeks befoi
opening of the season last year all
coast towns on the river were thronged
I with men, most of them Americans, but
1 to-day there are no quieter places than
these salmon towns. The canners have
their hands tied by the regulations, so
that they are unable to make arrange
ments for their labor. They are pre
paring for a bi.e season with the hope
thai from f.no or 600 men now in sight
as many thousand will turn up in some
mysterious way before the day on
which the season opens.
The very large canneries will have
little trouble, as thej will be able to
pay much higher prices, but some of
the smaller cannery proprietors have
already despaired of having their own
men, and will try to get a half pac'.;
; from the residue of the larger fac
-1 tories.
High prices will rule all through the
season, but from the difficulties of the
: new regulations and the scarcity of
available fishermen, none of the can
neries expect to put up more than half
as much as they otherwise would.

Mr. Rodgers made the point that the
board was called on to decide whether
an inferior or *. superior man should be
invited. He spoke of his Eastern obser
vations and bis talks with leading college
presidents and progressive educators gen
â¢ rally. He recognized that the University
of California was in position to assume
leadership in the field of Occidental civ
ilization, and believed that it was essen
tial that an expert educator should be
chosen, and that the salary should Invite
the services of an ail-round, able man of
university affairs. A man was needed
with the ability to select good subordi
nate material and eliminate the inferior.
Regent Kodgera did not know among the
eminent educators one that would come
hero for a salary of $6000 per annum.
The right kind of a man will effect a
! saving of $100,000 in several years' time.
K<*Kf>nt Foote. looking to the future, re
marked that he would never surrender to
a president the right to govern the per-
Eonnel of the university. He proposed a3
ji regent to exercise that right.
Dr. Rowell remarked that his experi
h ence in medicine was that the biggest
quacks got the largest fees.
Regent S'.ark vised the board that
the report simply flxed the amount that
might be expended for the president's
salary, but did not fix the compensation.
Judge Wallace directed the attention of
The regents to the following paragraph
of the conference committee report:
"We submit tho foregoing: FirstâWith
out recommendation or comment, the
proposition to rix the salary of the incom
ing president of tho university."
Regent Hallidie spoke, of the growth of
ealariea In the United States and the great
sums paid for :n-n with ability to direct
;ind organize. "An insurance' president
with exceptional ability in the selection
of subordinates _gets $10,000 per year.
The head of the \\ ire and Steel Trust re
ceives $40,000 per annum. We cannot get
a president of the first rank for less than
$10,000. I do not think the university at
this time should select a second-class
I resident.
The salary was fixed at $10,000 by the
vote of the following Regents: Ke'lloirir'
Budd, Hallidie. Houghton, Miller Barnes
Rodgers. Rowell. Slack and Wallaceâ 10 '
The proposition to tax the students $20
a year provoked an animated discussion
The committee report recommended that
the proposed registration fee should con
tinue only during the next academic year
It also proposed that the laboratory fees
be reduced one-half and the diploma fee
be abolished.
Dr. Pardee regarded the whole schema
Â§hk a makeshiftâ burden to fall on the
students this year. In justice to the stu
dents he approved the tax.
Regent Foote proclaimed his opposition
to the tax.
Regent Slack said the students were
Blropfy invited to help out the university
Judge Wallace left the chair to make a
speech opposing the scheme. He opposed
l:ne principle of calling upon students to
lay money for education which the State
promised should be free. He called to
mind that the proposition had been voted
Corn by the regents because it was wrong
In principle. He asserted that behind the
university was the wealth of the State
and the moral sentiment of the common
wealth in favor of free education. "The

This opposition Justified Mr. Foote in
bringing out in public discussion the fact
that Professor Gayley had written to
each regent of the board a letter, in which
jUr ! efforts to advance rrof.--s.-or
Byle were outlined. The assistant pro
fessor was mentioned as one "whom he

In a splendid outburst, Regent Foote
said to his colleagues on the board: "bo
tin- members of this Board of Regents
propose i" disgrace me? The term 'whom
he .alls hia cousin' Insinuates that per
bapÃ he la not my cousin."
Then was a K'Â»'d deal ol plain language

Regent John E. Budd testified to the ex

elements in the faculty were hostile to
tlii> young professor.
Regent Hallidie Bought to smooth mat
ters but rendered affairs worse. He said:
"It Is something entirely new for one re-
KÂ« nt to ask another to render him a per- '
Bonal favor, especially a favor against
the recommendation of the president.
Every mnn must feel the sense of deli
c&oy in the situation. I have that feeling
and entertain the highest regard for Re
irent Foote but I shall look to th<* prin

mistaken in his course."
Rpfjent Koote addressed Repent Halli

tesy 'he tone of courtesy dominating:
"I withdraw the personal request as to
you, Fir. I do not ask you to vote to sus

Th<re was some talk of raising Pi
sor Heaton's salary from $600 to H2OO. It
w:j- discovered that Heaton was working
three hours a week, hence the proposition
to Increase Ids salary was received with
some d"Â£ree of favor. The matter was
referred.
In tho discussion of the btidpr-t. Mr.
Foote disclosed the fact that a clique of
professors jealous of the lame which
Henry Ardfey is acquiring in the line of
arl Instruction, had schemed against him
and secured a reduction of his salary from
J2IOO to $1050. it whs Bald that the purpose
of the jealous professors was to down

Vrdley case was referred for investiga

Fudge Slack suggested a reference to the
committee in order to secure readjust
ment In the salaries of Professors Bailey
and Flagg. The salaries were inadequate
Regent Albert Miller was appointed to
fill a vacancy on the Wilmerdlng School
Committee.
The budget was then adopted.
The event of the day was the nexi fea
ture of the session. When the chairman
announced, "Election of president is in
order," Reppnt Reinstein suggested in
view of the absence of Governor Gas^ and
Mrs Hearst, and the fact thai General
Barnes bad itist taken his place in the
board, a lay should be Bet apart for the
1 it ct lon of president.
Arthur Rodgers objected, citing the cir
cumstances that Governor Gage had signi
fied a determination not to participate in
the election. A telegram was read show
ing that Mrs. Hearst's absence would be

Hearst did not desire to participate in the
election.
The motion to postpone was lost by a
vote of S to 7.
Regent Foote presented the name of
Dr. J. K. Stubbs, president of the Nevada
i University. A high tribute was paid to
the character and scholarly attainments .
of Dr. Stubbs. Regent Foote read from
j manuscript the speech setting forth the
j merits of the candidates. It was observed
j that a photograph of Dr. Stubbs was at
! tached to the last page of the manuscript.
I Many high Indorsements of the doctor
â  were also submitted.
The speech of the day was made by
i Regent Arthur Rodgera In presenting the
merits of Benjamin Ide Wheeler. Mr.

Mr. Rodgers submitted to these men bis i
I list of candidates. The iirst two on the
; list were President Hyde of Bowdoin Col

In nearly every instance a second reading
of the first two names was requested.
â  Others were commended, but these- were
' specially extolled as men possessing' all
j around attainments of exceptional cmi-
nee.
"President Hyde," Bald Regent Rodgers,
. "is 44 years old, vigorous and broad.
In many respects he is the greatest
, college president in the country. Hi Is a
! clergyman and his sermons are powerful.
"Professor Wheeler came out here last
1 March. You had on opportunity of see
i Ing him. Everything considered I regard
him as the best man for our university.
He is a man 44 years of age, of fine pres
ence, excellent health. He was born In
Massachusetts, and his father Is a Bap
tist clergyman."
Mr. Rodgers did not allude to the fact
that the father of Jeffries, the champion
in another profession, Is likewise the son
of a Baptist clergyman, but the regents
"were on."
Mr. Rodgera did read a letter from
' President Adams of the University of
â  Wisconsin, wherein Dr. Wheeler is spoken
I of as an inspiring teacher and a great
master of university affairs, who has de
clined offers of $10,000 a year. Dr. Wheeler
was also spoken of as a "splendid embodi

WHEELER GETS THE NEWS
As He Was Not a Candidate He
Was Much Surprised.
ITHACA. N. T.,, June 16.â Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Cornell was in
terviewed to-night regarding his election
as president of the University of Califor
nia. He was much surprised when he
heard it, as no word had reached him of
the appointment up to 11 o'clock to-night.
He said: "As I was not a candidate for
tho position in the first place the matter
had almost passed out of my mind. On
one occasion of my visit to the institution
some time ago 1 had an opportunity to
learn the condition of affairs. I told the
authorities at that time that I could not
think of accepting the presidency unless
every one concerned was perfectly wiliina;
to have me come there, and there were
other things which I thought ought to bo
fixed up. Since then 1 have heard noth
ing definite from the authorities and do
not know how matters stand now."
"Would you accept the position if it
were offered you now?"; was asked.
"I should have to look Into the matter
carefully. I do not know whether affairs
have been arranged, and as 1 should like
to have the position of honor, which one
could not well despise. I must waft t<)
hear something more definite from head
quarters."
It is the general opinion among mem
bers of the faculty that Professor
Wheeler will go to the now position. It ia
known that he named special conditions
under which he would agree to accept 1
the appointment. < >i;e of these, it Is ru
mored, was that the entire faculty of the
university should resign in order to adr
jusi differences in that body. Whether
the authorities of the Western institution
have conformed to this condition is not
known at Cornell to-nierht.
HEALTH OFFICERS' SUIT.
Judge Hunt Intimates That They
Cannot Hold Their Positions.
Next week Judge Hunt will decide !
whether or not the minor officials of the
Board of Health appointed during the
hint administration arc statutory officers
and hoM for four years or whether they
| are simply holding- by virtue of appoint
on at and may be dismissed at the pleas
ure of the appointing power. Yesterday
the action of the fifteen officials, to re
straln the new board from dismissing
them, came up before .TudÃp Hunt in the
nature of a motion to dissolve the in-
Junction heretofore issued restraining the
board from removing: the petitioners until
further ordÂ»>r of court.
The new board was represented by C
.T. Heggerty and W. M. Madden, with
Garret McEnerney as counsel by virtue
of his office us attorney of the old b ard.
Peter F. Dunne represented tin- petition
ers.. It was first Boughi to dissolve the
Injunction on the ground thttt Jml"Â».
Daingerfield had erred in issnii:^ the in
junction without demanding a bond
Judge Hunt, however, held that Judge
Daingerfteld had :-.ot erred and denied the
motion. It was next claimed thai of the
fifteen petitioners bui seven could claim
to be statutory officers, the others being
appointive; that the seven who make
the claim that they are statutory oili.-.-rs
<Â»:â â¢â  simply employes and may }Â»â  dis
missed :n any time; hence a dissolution
if the Injunction wa asked.
Mr. I>>;m;>- on behalf of the petitioners,
argued that all were atat itory officers,
and thai it waa not in the discretion of
thi- board to declare their places vacant
and appoint others to fill them. When
the case was submitted Judge Hunt said
thai he would decide it early next week.
and that he believed the points raised
wer^ the same as thoso in th.> Kate Ken
nedy and P. [>. Weaver cases, in which ir
was held itmi th,.. appointing power had
th-- power of removal.

Tlif> American ship John n. Kelly la
ashore on the Falkland Islands nnd will
probably be a total loss. A cablegram
to the Merchants' Exchange gives the
bare fact that she was hard ashore at
Port Stanley and that the chances of
saving- either the vessel or cargo were
very slight. The belief among shipping
mow in that the Kelly was disabled in
a storm off Cape Horn and that Captain
Chapman was making for Port Stanley
to repair damages. Jt is a very dangerous
place to entor and the chances arc that
something gave way at a critical moment
arsd the ship went ashore.

The John R. Kelly was partially owned
in San Francisco. The firm of James F
Chapman & Co. has owned an interest in
her since B he was launched at Bath, Me
in 1883. She was built by Goss & Sawyer
and was as si. ,ut a craft as Balled the
s. as. She was 256 feel 9 inches long 45 1
feel beam 27 feel 8 Inches deep and 2255
tons net burden. Her managing owner
was John K. Kelly of Bath. Se \lm.i â 
no valued her at $75,000 The vessel's
was consigned to Williams. Dlmond
iV- ( o. as distributing aprents and the ship
to James F. Chapman & Co. The cargo
is Insured and the vessel is not, but ns the
Kelley has been a very lucky sliip she
has probably paid for herself 'twice over
durinp her lifetime.
The four-masted steel schooner Hono
lulu is making. a very lons passage from
the Hawaiian Islands. She is now out
thirty-three days fnun Honolulu, and as
seventeen and nineteen days have been j
long runs of late people are wondering
what has become, of the crack schooner
The chances are that Captain Tnonagel
has got away up north and cannot j.'vt
down apaln. For weeks the prevailing
winds have been northwest, and th>>
schooner would lipht her way north in
order to run down to Pan Francisco. Now
the wind has been from the opposite di
rection for several days and the"schooner
is probably lighting her way back again.
Captain Thonagel is more than anxious
to reach San Francisco, for as soon as he
arrives and enters his ship he is to sta-t
for Scotland. The people who own the
Honolulu. Hawaiian Isle, John Kna ant]
half a dozen other vessels, are contracting '
i In Scotland for two four-masted barken
tines, and Captain Thonagel is going to
superintend tne building of them. The
new vessels are being built for the
Australian trade.
Captain Thimagrl la not the only ship
master who Is going to superintend the
building of a new ship, however. Captain
Dahel of the four-masted schooner Aloha
is K"InK to Hath, Me, to look after the
building of nn American steel bark. She
will In' American from truck to keelson,
and will be built for speed combined with I
a g-nod carrying capacity. She is for the
sugar trade.
The steamer Celia returned to port yes

G. Amadure, a teamster for the King-
Morse Canning Company, -was injured by
an electric car yesterday morning. Ama
dure was driving his team along East
street and was crossing that street near
Mission when the car came along, and
striking the wagon threw the teamster be
tween the wagon nnd the motor. Amadure
was removed to the Harbor Hospital,
where it was found that he had a com
pound fracture of the right leg and had
also sustained internal injuries. Amadure
claims that he could not get his wagon
out of tho way in time, as the car was
going at a high rate of speed.
THE RIGHT TO KILL.
Supreme Justices Differ Upon a Los '
Angeles Homicide Case.
J. I. Harris and George Cardwell were
convicted In the Superior Court of Los
Angeles of the crime of manslaughter for
killing John W. Hilton. They appealed
to the Supreme Court from the judgment
and order denying a new trial, hut with- ;
out avail, although Chief Justice Beatty
considered that they should have a new
trial. The opinions of the other six Jus
tices and Justice Beatty are of interest,
especially to gun fighters.
Hilton closed a road across his premises
by erecting a wire fence. His neighbors,
Harris and Card well, claimed the right to
travel on the road, and the ill feeling
which arose caused Hilton t% inform th.-m
he would kill them if they attempted to |
use the old road. The two defendants,
armed with a shotgun and rifle, a third
mar driving tin- tram, started to travel
over the forbidden highway. They cut the I
wires, and when Hilton saw them he went
to his house and reappeared with a rifle,
and attempted to gain tne shelter of a
large tree ahead of the trespassing party.
Harris ordered Hilton to drop his run,
and Hilton demanded that the invaders
retire. As Hilton was about to pass be- .
hind the tree the accused firÂ«*d, killing !
him.
The two men insisted that the evidence
in the lower court showed a case of justi
fiable homicide. The higher court did not
consider the case as to the right of way
over the road, but Raid: "The jury had
the right to say that at this time (when
the three armed men meti they hll stood
upon common ground, and that the light
of the law shone upon (Til alike. An overt i
act at this critical period was bound to I
cause a tragedy: and the jury was justi
fied in saying undtr the law and upon I
the facts that the defendants should not 1
] have (tied the fatal shots."
Justice Beatty. in dissenting, places the
case in an altogether different light. He |
recites that the road in quest ion had been
in iiinimon use by those living up the
valley for many years; that under the
circumstances the farmers had no means
!of taking their produce to market or
getting supplies to their families whil n
the old road was eloped They had a clear .
right to travel the old road. Having been '
â¦old by Hilton that he would kill tbt-m '
â  if they attempted to exercise that right
i thny did what was proper and manly in ;
; carrying arms when traveling on thai ;
; read. TVhen they saw Hilton leave the j
j field and procure his rifle, they naturally
supposed that he intended to carry out
his threat and to believe that Hilton's at
â  tempt to reach the oak tree was to place ,
himself so that he could shoot ami still
be protected from Injury. As Hilton had
1 a bad reputation, the accused need expect
! but little mercy and were justified in thei-
j plea of pelf defense. Justice Beatty con
siders that Harris and Cardwell should
be granted a new trial.
GUNS FROM SANTIAGO

bay. With tii' Iditi nal connections, strictly lim

The i>!an to withdraw the Market street system from
local assessment by extending one of its lines into
Ssn Mateo County, which was exposed by The '"ill
last February, has been frustrated. The extension on
Railroad avenue r-tops twenty feet short of the di
\uling line between San Francisco and San Mateo
County. The situation at that point is that the rattles
have been cut oft the Market street tail, and the strag
gling end remains, which may be u-ed for squirming
purposes, but otherwise is probably unavailable.
The Call hopes that everybody is now satisfied. The
â  eastern property owners are accommodated. The
Merchants' Association has proved its common sense
and it< influence. The street railway monopoly has
discovered that it is not omnipotent and that it takes
at least seven Supervisors to consummate a steal.
The community has reasserted its power and demon
strated that public opinion, deliberately formed and
inexorably applied, is still controlling in American
cities. Truth and justice have been vindicated, and
apparently one battle royal is over.
There are other things left that demand unrelaxing
vigilance and determination. Politics must be
â¢â ~ed and party methods substantially purified by
decent and progressive citizens, who possess Ameri
conceptions and are capable of administering
purgative medicines without receiving their prescrip
tions from cranks or sentimentalists. The immediate
future will be decidedly interesting.
General Luna seems to be passing through an in
sting experience. A few days ago he was as
sassinated by command of Aguinaldo, and now lie
is issuing new bombastic addresses to his troops. The
press censor of the Philippines must be on a spree.
Comte de Dion, one of the Parisian rioters, boasts
that lie took lessons in kicking, and if he ever hit any
one the i-sue would be ended. The Comte ought to
be sentenced to establish personal communication
with the hind legs of a mule.
Fitzsimmons seems to think now that there was
some informality in his introduction to Jeffries. He
wants to meet him again.
A POLITICAL WARNING.
IT is unnecessary for The Call to reaffirm its cmn
plete devotion to the Republican party of the
United States nor its determination, to the extent
of its influence, to enforce ordinary decency upon the
party management in this municipality and in this
' State. The approaching election is of great local
nee, and already the notes of preparation are
[to be heard on every side. A Republican municipal
i convention is to be held and a Republican ticket
nominated. Many thousands of reputable citizens,
I who are large factors in the enterprise, the intelli
! gence and the accumulated property of San Francisco,
I and who pay a heavy proportion of the taxes that sup
': port the municipal government, are also Republicans
and deeply interested in Republican success at the.
polls. A ticket that commands their support can be
elected. A ticket that excites their disgust will be
â 
The vital question, which has to be settled without
i delay or evasion, is whether the decent and honest
' elements of the party are to control its nominations
and its management during the canvass. If
rupt and degraded machine politicians have
a grip upon the organization that cannot be
or relaxed, defeat stares the Re
-1 publican ticket in the face. Never in the his
les] tism of the raih
represented bj ims, William F. Herrin and
Governor i\?.\.-c. been so defiantly exercised. Sub
stantially and practically the entire State patronage,
without even a pretense of regard for the public wel
boldly used in the railroad interest.
There is no office so low or s<~> high that it escapes
Lthis shai ition. Mr. Huntington and
his. <â  rtunity is due to gross
hery and fraud, musi b that the mass of
the peopl* â ;>' and cowardly.
If this concentrated and arrogant railroad influence
is to be exerted in I nipulation of local party
machinery and in the municipal convention, the best
Republicans in this city will stand from under. They
will r of their means nor ol their in
!',!<â  support <â ;' railroad nominees nor t<-> any
I for which Dan Burns and the machine politi
cians ntroi nd with whom he i~ combined are
responsible. The very existence of this community
great metropolitan centers of the
United States is involved in the question of clean
municipal government. 'Hie degradati pa^t

independent ai itive Republicans feel and are

paid for their corruption principally by their stealings
from the public crib.
The ; ' lican Pieces?. San
Francisco shares with other American communities
all over the continei t tl lion that the salvation of

cannot monopolize the management of Republican
politics in the municipal struggle upon which we are
to enter.
We hope that wi~>' ; m and may be locally
â â 'â¢ and accorded their just weight. Substan
tial citizens, f pi ting both
labor and capital, a mi any suspicion of
erviency to monopolistic corruption, should be
placed in positions of lead thin the local R<
publican organization. A convention should be held
in which the sound chai complet<
c, the practical intelligence and the und< I
Republicanism of ever) should be beyond
r cavil. Mr. Phelan, it he obtains a renomi
nation from his own party, should be confronted by a
man who all the qualifi or leading
a municipal government that he especially lacks and
whose name and standing would be a guarantee
again si del . â  â  ' and for the wise exercise of the
appointing power under the new charter. Every
nominee upon the ticket should be equally adapted
to the position to which he is assigned, and the com
bined result of patriotic and honest discrimination
should be invested with the invincible strength of fit-
tcr.
These rue the outlines of a campaign that would
â ,i the motley collection of fusionists into oblivion
;<r,t\ place San Francisco in the front rank of progres
sive \mericanism. For such a success The Call will
strive with all the energy ami power it can exert. Rut
it wiil not submit, and the sturdy Republicans of this
city will no) submit, to railroad domination and to
machin :tion.
THE HAWAIIAN LABOR PROBLEM.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the rapid increase of Japanese immigration
to Hawaii has attracted the attention of our
i Government and has given rise to no little concern
in official circle-. It is added the Bureau of Immigra
tion has undertaken to devise means whereby the im
migration may be clucked, but inasmuch as Congress
failed last winter to enact any permanent form of gov
ernment for the islands, it is not easy to see what can
be ''one.
The subject was discussed at some length during the
last session of Congress, and it was noted even then
that the Japanese immigration was growing to
ominous proportions. Statistics were cited showing
that from August 12, i.B<>S, when our flag went up at
Hawaii, to January 6, 1899, there were imported
7630 contract laborers of .-ill races, and from January
6 to February 2 there had been added 27^,2, making
70.412 in all. Some were Europeans, but most were
Japanese and Chinese, the Japanese being in the ma
jority.
It is now asserted on authority of an official report
from Honolulu that since the annexation of the
islands more than 12,000 Japanese have arrived at
that port, and no re son exists for believing the report
to be exaggerated. In fact, Japanese labor has been
highly valued on the plantations, and the planters are
doubtless doing all they can to encourage its immi-
gration.
We directed attention a short time ago to the un
satisfactory situation of white labor in the islands, as
reported by the Hawaiian papers themselves. Tt
seems to be generally accepted there, as lias been re
peatedly said by The Call, that white labor is unttted
for the cultivation of tropical sugar fields. Of course
the United States cannot consent to permit the plant
ers to import coolie laborers to compete with the
white labor of this country. Ilonce the concern
among the officials at Washington and the efforts now
i eing made to devise some means of preventing a fur-
I ther Japanese immigration.
According to the Inter Ocean, Senator Cullom,
| president of the Hawaiian Commission, said in a re-
TITE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE IT, 1899.
I cent interview that the commission has already done
! its duty in this case. It has given the planters of
| Hawaii to understand that if they do not conform to
the general policy of this country to prevent labor im
portation the plan of government for Hawaii now
| pending in Congress will be changed, and be less sat
| isfactory to them.
It is clear from the reports of the increase in the
importation of cheap labor that the menace of the
commission is not so effective as Senator Cullom
thinks. The Government at Washington will have
to exert itself vigorously to put an end to the evil,
and the sooner the exertion is made the better.
MORE THAN THE TRAFFIC WILL BEAR.
ONCE more the Southern Pacific monopoly in
its persistent efforts to increase its burdens
and irritations upon the public to the full ex
tent the traffic will bear has gone beyond the limit
and aroused popular indignation to the point of re
sistance. It has undertaken to collect freight charges
upon packages carried by passengers upon the ferry
between this city and Oakland, and has begun the
extortion under such circumstances and in such a
manner as to make it an absolute outrage.
It appears that no notice was given to the public
of the intention of the monopoly to enforce the
newly devised exactions, but the employes at the efr
rics received orders to demand fare for parcels. Thus
the outrage came upon the people in the nature of a
surprise. It was another illustration not only of
Southern Pacific extortions, but of the Southern Pa
cific insolence of method of putting its decrees into
effect.
In the new venture the monopoly is evidently not
| playing for itself only. The Wclls-Fargo Company
will reap a share of the spoils to be exacted by the
In charges. If the extortion can be enforced a
I many additional parcels will be intrusted to
the company for transportation between this city and
the communities on the other side of the bay. and
there will be more dimes taken from the public to
; increase the profits of that tax-shirking corporation.
Every step in this scheme from conception to en
forcement shows an utter disregard for the rights of
citizens, an utter contempt for law and a complete in
difference to popular sentiment. Believing itself se
.i-.rc in the possession of a monopoly, the Southern
Pacific is reckless of all else. It has discovered a
traffic which it thinks can bear a heavier burden than
has been borne in the past, and proceeds to raise the
rate?.
In the meantime the \Yells-F.\rgo Company, the
ally that is to share in the plunder of the public, goes
â â  on with it? old exactions of war taxes from its patrons,
or, to be more exact, its victims. Despite the deci
sions of many courts that the war revenue act re
quires express companies to affix the revenue stamps
to parcels passing through their hands, the company
continues to enforce its demand?, to exact it? tribute,
to rob the public and to enrich itself, with all the arro
gance " ; a power superior to Congress, to the courts
and to the people.
I; does seem at times as if all the devils that en
tered the Gadarene swine had passed from those
beast? to the manager? of the Southern Pacific and
t he Wells-Fargo companies and had carried some of
: the nature of the hog? as well as their own abomina
tion with them. They seem so bent upon irritating
as well as robbing the public that it is difficult to
credit them with ordinary good sense.
It may be that a competing line of ferry-boats is the
only effectual remedy for the repeated extortions and I
mitmÃcs committed by the monopoly, but it is;
nevertheless, worth while for habitual passengers on
the ferry-boats to make a fight. If the exactions be
isted day after day they will have to be abandoned :
in the end. When the burden becomes more than the

WELCOME FOR THE OREGON TROOPS.
A DISPATCH from Washington announces that
the Oregon volunteers, who s:u!e<l from Manila
on Wednesday, will return home by way of
this port. San Francisco, therefore, will lie the point
at which their welcome should begin, and the greeting
litre should be not less enthusiastic and loyal than
that which will meet them in their own State.
The date of the arrival of a transport cannot be
fixed as accurately as' that of an ocean liner, and
therefore it is not certainly known at this time on
what day the troops will arrive. A stop will be made
fit Nagasaki for the purpose of coaling, and some
thing like thirty days may be counted on for t*;e voy
age. That gives ample time to make such prepara
dons as may be necessary to provide a welcome which
will assure the volunteers of the pride with which
their service in the Philippines is regarded through
out the Pacific Coast.
When the volunteers of the Eastern States returned
from Cuba they were welcomed with all the !
demonstrations of n patriotism still ardent with the
glow of the war spirit which then had not died out of
the public mind. The return of the Pacific Coast i
troops occurs under different conditions. The war
with Spain has become something of an old story,
and popular excitement has subsided. There remains, !
however, to animate the people, that principle of loy- \
alty which never weakens and which is ever ready to
respond to every rightful appeal that may be made to |
it. It is fair, therefore, to expect of San Francisco a
welcome for the Oregon volunteers equal in even'
respect to that accorded the most favored State troops
of the East on their return from Santiago.
While the fighting in the Philippines has not held
public attention so strongly as did the war with Spain. '
while there are no longer great crowds swarming
around the bulletin boards to catch every new report !
from the front, the contest with the Filipinos has i
been on the whole more severe than that with the
Spaniards, and the Pacific Coast troops have done
much more service than those of the East who fought
at Santiago. They therefore merit a higher reward
of popular applause and should receive it from the
people of whatever city first welcomes them back to
the soil of the United States.
It was from this port the Oregon volunteers set
forth for the long voyage to the Orient, and to this
port they return after having heroically served the
republic and gloriously upheld the prestige of their
State and their section. They are not Californians
indeed, but they are Pacific Coast men and our fel
low countrymen. They come to us as kinsmen, and
when they land on our shores should find their wel
come made clear to them by every form of public
manifestation, from the formal action of municipal
officials to the free and spontaneous outburst of the
cheers atid the acclamations of the people.
The startling announcement is made that the
Venezuelan Commissioners have begun their work at
Paris dressed in frock coats. The veracious cor
respondent seemed to think that the distinguished
diplomats ought to have their coats off. in view of the
character of the dispute they are to settle.
Without dropping into slang one can safely say that
the Big Consolidated in Cleveland has slipped its
trolley.
NEWS OF REALTY WORLD
Thf> stagnation in the real estatp market
continues, with no Immediate prospect of
Improvement. Tn fact, the brokers aa h
rule do not look for ;i revival of business
before the Ist of September, when people
begin to return from their vacations. Of
course, sales are being made dally, but
they ;m- for the most part small and of
little consequence so far as griving any
indication of the condition of the market
is concerned. The few transactions that
can be classed aa big include the sale of
the Taber property on O'Farrell street,
adjoining the Orpheum, for $80,000, men
tion of which was made last week, and
the sale of the four-story brick building
and lot on the west side of Battery street,
eighty feet north of Bush. The latter
property was sold by Bovee, Toy & Sunn
tag to Belle Curtis and lizzie Muir for
W. B. Scholl, the price paid being $80,000.
The latter linn also sold 277 acres in Santa
Clara County, seven and a half miles from
the railroad station, all in grain with the
exception of nine acres which are In fruit,
including an eight-room house and two
barns, for $16, .",00. The seller was James
McMahon and the buyer the State Pack
ing and Fruit Company.
Both of these deals have been on the
tapis for some time past, and the former,
while practically consummated, is not yet
officially announced.
The favorable action of the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors on the
corkscrew franchise is regarded as a
great boon to the northern section of the
city, especially that portion bordering on
the bay. The railroad company has stated
through one of its principal officials that
the work of laying the tracks and putting
the new line in operation will begin at
once and be pushed to completion, and
this action will undoubtedly be followed
by a general overhauling and remodeling
of property which will be benefited by the
establishment of modern transfer facili
ties.
Baldwin & Howell have sold the fifty
vara lot on the southeast corner of Page
street and Central avenue for $14,000. The

THE STRIKE
AT REDDING.
REPT>T\O, CaT., June 15, 1599.
Tn the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir;
Inclosed find a statement : placing thÂ«>
position of the striking miners at Iron
Mountain squarely before the public,
as you have been publishing consider-
ile matter regarding the lock-out.
We respectfully request that you givft
our statement position in your valuable
paper.
Thanking you in advance for this
favor, we remain, very respectfully,
THE COMMITTEE.
"We, the â undÂ°rsigT>ed, constituting' a
! committee of the employes of the Iron
j Mountain mine at Iron Mountain, Field
i ing, Cal., controlled and conducted by the
Mountain Copper Company, limited, bog
leave to make the following statement re
lating to the strike declared on the 13th
inst.: On June 10 a grievance committee
of twelve men waited upon Superintend
j ent Archer and asked for, in behalf of
| the employes of the corporation, a uni
â¢ form increase of 40 cents in all branches
of the mining business. At the [ t
time miners are receiving $2 60 per day,
anil the lower grades of workmanship
from $1 60 to $2 10 per day, which in our
opinion is considerably below the aver
age schedule in force on similar proper
ties in this and other parts of the State.
We believe our cause is a just one. and
desire to inform the mining public to that
effect.
We also desire to draw attention to the
state of affairs in the conduct of the
boarding-house, which is controlled by
the aforesaid corporation- In our opinion
the food provided is absolutely unfit for
human consumption, and in view of the
fact that employes of the company are
compelled to patronize the institution un
; der penalty of discharge, we consider this
â¢ feature a most deplorable one.
The strike was a general one, over 50ii
men going out as aeainnt but two. who
oppose them by remaining. We desire to
publicly denounce them by subjecting
them to the ridicule of their fellow-work
men.
The striking workmen are behaving in
a most orderly manner, notwithstanding
their just grievances. They have left the
vicinity of the property and are quartered
in towns adjacent thereto.
We desire to call attention to these
facts and ask all miners in sympathy
with their fellow-workmen to assist us in
bringing the strike to a successful termi
nation by refraining fmm offering their
services to the corporation concerned.

SAX FRAXCISCO. June 15, 1599.
Mayor's Ofhce; City and County of
San Franciscoâ To Ni Mar Geej lessee
of premises, southwest corner of
Bakt-r and Sullivan alleys: Within
three days after service upon you of
this notice, you are hereby required
-to abate the nuisance now existing- at
the southwest corner of Baker and
Sullivan alleys, in the city and county
of San Francisco, towit: The use
and occupance of said promises for
purposes <>i prostitution. Killing to
comply with the terms of this notice
within said time, will subject you to
penalties prescribed by the act of
.\iareh 31; lvW. entitled "An act for the
suppression of Chinese houses of ill-
Pne," as amended by the actj ap
>vÂ»-il F'bru.wy 7, 1>74.
JAMES D. PHELAX, Mayor,
is needless to say that the receipt of
notic- caused consternation in China
town. The Yigilants had been heard of
and scoffed at. The owners of th^ dens
looked upon it as a blackmailing' scheme, .
pure ana simple, and hourly awaited the
arrival of the agent of the society in
fjur-st of a fee to omit the name of the
house from the list. But th^ agent never
came. In his place was the order from
the Mayor directing 1 the social outcasts
to leave their abodes or he would call
upon the police to eject them under the
law "luotf'd.
The officers of the Bow TV"ah Tong, or
Flave dealers' association, held a hasty
conference and selected a prominent law
yer to handle the case. With their cus
tomary secretiven<=ss the Chinese refuse
to divulge his naraf, but rumor has it
that the man is former Judge Ferral.
i\Vhen it comes to giving their side of the
story, however, th^y were more garru
lous. Th^se dealers, with an extraordin
ary familiarity with a law which ha al
'.ays been ignored by them, stated that
it could easily be defeated. "Class or spe
cial legislation," said on* 4 of them, "is >
unconstitutional. This law provides only
for the suppression of Chinese houses of
i!l-farne and is therefore unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court has decided similar
cases time and again and we are safe."
Aside from this th<> i.'' n< ral impression
prevails that the Mayor's notice is more
than half bluff, or in other words that in-
Btead of every o>n being turned Inside
cut the kepper of on*> of the houses will,
at the expiration of the â¢ ted time, be
? laced under arrest, and a test case made,
n thfÂ» meantime; his and all other houses
will run full blast Jusn as usual. The
Vigilants, at whose instigation Mayor
Phelan sent out the notices, have made
cut no such programme. The society
â¢wants to fee the law as it stands on the
6tatute books enforced. It Is Its desire
to have every house closed according to
law and common sense, which is the foun
dation of all law, and let each and every
on>nd*Â»r be given a irate trial if nec
essary. The. object nrst and foremost is
to close the houses.

In thp Fire Department Fund, which
would revert to the general fund at the
close of this fiscal year.

sent out here on speculation and one

MARTIN IS WROTHY.
Says Secretary Kavane Unjustly Cut
His Expense Bills.
Martin is Indignant at the way
Governor Gage's private, secretary, Ka
vane, has been shaving his bills for travel
ing expenses. The Sheriff says that Ka
vane seems to have usurped the functions
of the Board of Examiners in that re
spect and his br-en cutting out nickels,
dimes and quarters from his bills without
reason. He says that Items of car fare
for deputies from the City Hall to Broad
way Jail to pet prisoners, and from there
to train or boat, have been knocked out,
while necessary carriage hire for use
Of insane patients and dangerous crim
inals has been shaved without justice or
reason.
The Sheriff d'-ni.-s Kavane's alleged
statement that his deputies charged $1
for each meal when away from home.
Regarding Kavane's statement that depu
ties unnecessarily remain over night when
conducting prisoners and Insane patients
'â  to the prisons or asylums. Sheriff Martin
i says it is untrue. Insane patients are
; controlled entirely by the Lunacy Com
missioners, who order their commitment
I forthwith. As commitments are made
I during the day. the Sheriff has no choice
I in the matter." but must send them to the
asylum <>n the first train, which is in the
afternoon. The deputy is consequently
obliged to remain away all night. Tho
Sheriff was obliged to visit Sacramento
to s,>" that his bills wpre not cut un
justly and Kavane expressed his approval
l of them when th? items were explained to
him.

REFUSES TO REVEAL
HER IDENTITY.
The Mysterious Emma
Johnson Still in the
Hospital.
THE mysterious woman who w as picked up in a semi-ur.conseioup rnn
dition at Seventh and Howard streets late on Thursday night and who
gave her name as Krnma Johnson, Mill occupies a cot in the female
ward of the Receiving Hospital. She refuses to throw any light on
her antecedents except to nay that she recently arrived from the north.
Last evening she was visited by two female acquaintances, who Beemed as
mysterious as their unfortunate friend. One of thorn, who refused to givÂ©
her name, while claiming that she met the woman several years ago, laugh
ingly remarked that she did not know her true name.
While admitting that her name is not Etpma Johnson, the patient per
sistpntiy refused to tell who she Is or how long she has been in the city.
"I don't want my nnrents to know of my misfortune." she tenderly re
marked. "I know thai it would break my poor old mother's heart. It Is
â¢' .â¢ ;hat I am mnrried. but 1 am not living with my husband. He deserted me
and 7 was compelled to hire out as a domestic to provide for myself." The
woman emphatically refii-erj to ten w!.<--re she had worked.
"It Is my business," she remarked when asked to give the names of her
employers. "I would rather die than reveal their Identity."
To Matron Kane the woman said she arrived In the city nti"<it a year ago
and procured employment as a domestic In a house on Clay street, the nura
b< r cf which she refused to give. ShÂ» subsequently lost her position and
through a friend, whose name she refused to reveal, she was given employ
ment with a family in th<> Western Addition. A.boul kwo weeks ago she was
diP'hargen 1 . and since then Bbc has been out of employment.
On Thursday, finding that the small amount of money she had was gnnp,
she wsml'Tw] about the city in the hope that she would meet some friend
who would at leapt assist her in getting something to eat. Exhausted and
almost famished, she strolled along Seventh street, and when contiguous to
Howard street she collapsed. A citizen who was passing at the time picked
her up and carried her into a drugstore on the corner. As she seemed to be
p.-rior.sly 111. the druggist had her removed to the Receiving Hospital.
Severnl charitably Inclined women, on learning of her sad predicament,
yesterday visited the hospital and endeavored to learn from her own lips the
story of her troubles. While treating them emiretoously, she positively re
fused to reveal her identity, on the plea that she did not want her mother to
know of her misfortune.

sisting of Byington (chairman), Aigeltin
â  i Phelps.
The committee mi-t yesterday and
Phelps moved that the California Title
Insurance and '['rust Company's bid for
the larger amount be recommended for
ptance, the amount to be provided
; for in the tax levy for the next fiscal
i year. Byington opposed the motion on
ground that until an election Is held
and the question Is determined whether
bonds shall be issued for the purchase
of the property in question II would be
premature and wholly unn ssary to ex
pend such b largi sum. Besides no use
could be in:..!, i | th< titles until after the
election was held and condemnation pro-

verse t" thi pp position the money would
be entirely thrown away. After th^ prop
osition had been adopi d by the voters it
I be ample time to secure the ab
strai ts of titles.
Algeltinger seconded Phdjis' motion and
It was carried, Byington voting against
it. Afterward Aigeltinger explained his
i by saying he merely seconded the
it of < lurtesy to Phelps, but that

JURY SECURED
FOR TRIAL OF
OSCA WELBURN
Thirty- One Charges
Against Him.
FORGERY AND EMBEZZLEMENT
DOCTORED VOUCHERS FOR UN
EARNED SALARIES.
Louis Loupe, the Former Chier Depu
ty, Takes the Stand for the
Government and Identi
fies the Accounts.
When Judgfe dp Haven called the court
to order yesterday morning for the trial
of Osca M. W'elburn It was found that
i some nf the jury panel w< re absent and
a recess was taken until 2 p. in., when a
jury wa.s quickly secured, as follows: \V.
G. Ayres. E. A. Hubbard, William R.
Knight. Henry Frohman, Thomas J. Da
i vis, F. Tormey, Marcus M. Henry. S. W. \
Simmons. R. R. Stewartson, George Bar
; ber, Hugh Marshall and C. H. Wads
i worth.
! Assistant United States Attorney Wood
worth made the opening statement for
the Government, it was as brief and
concise as possible and consisted of a
synopsis â â¢:" the charges contained in the
thirty-one counts in the indictment. The
first twelve cnmits charged the prisoner
with having forged twelve vouchers for
â â  the monthly salary of Clerk K. C. Akins,
and with haviiiK embezzled the difference
between $25 per month, which he paid
Akins, and the sums called for in the
vouchers.
The thirteenth, fourteenth ami fifteenth
counts iclat'-il to vouchers made oui for
the salary of Miss Nellie O'Brien, a clerk
In VVelburn's office. These vouchers were
written for $102 per month, and it was
alleged that Welburn paid her only $.">iÂ»
per month. During the month of Febru
ary, 1595, Miss O'Brien did not work at
all, yet a voucher for $102 was cashed.
The seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth
and twentieth counts related to forged
vouchers in the name of Clyde Welburn,
the son of the defendant. The twenty
first, twenty-second and twenty-third
counts related to forged vouchers In th^
name of Miss Mary McCarthy, a clerk
who died on December 1, 1895. A voucher
for her services for thai month -was also
cashed.
Miss M. K. Council's iiamf appeared in
counts twenty-four and twenty-five as
; having drawn $61 SO per month, when in
fact, according to the prosecution, she
had not drawn a dollar. The remaining
counts dealt with false vouchers in the
name of Clerk VV. E. Zoller. On one oc
casion $150 i>.'. was drawn and onlj S -
I paid to Zoller. At another time $14550 was
I drawn and $98 59 paid to him. The alle
gation was also made that vouchers had
been drawn for traveling expenses al
leged tn have been incurred by Zoller,
! when in fact /.oii.T had not been oui of
I the office at all.
United States Marshal Shine. Deputy
Marshal Moffitt and chief Office Deputy
Parish testified as to the arrest and Iden
tification of Welburn. Louis Loupe, chief
Deputy Collector under Welburn, was
called t" Identify certain accounts of the
office, after which the trial was ... â 
until Monday morning.

MILKERS' UNION APPEAL.
The Labor Council Takes Cognizance
of Convict-Made Stoves.
The Labor Council at its meeting last
night officially declared ;i boycott on the
Sun Pedro ami X L Dairy, and in connec
tion with this the following appeal re
ceived tin 3 Indorsement of the council:
I The Milkers' Union ol California appeals to
you t'i assist it In removing the many abuses
under which thf milkers in this Stat.- suffer.
The hours of labor in many ol tli>- .l,iiri"s for â 
years have been from twelve to eighteen )â¢â¢â )â¢
day, wages have been email, food with but lew
ngufflcieni and poor, and sleeping
.1 commodations such that decency and the
I common laws of health were violated.
Driven to desperation and seeing th;it work
Â»rs in other trades <>rÂ«nnizÂ»'i and thereby suc
ceeded in bettering their conditions, thf> inilk
i ers, ton, a few months ago formed h union, and
â¢ H^istffl by the Sun Francis. -n Labor Council,
. with which body it Is now afflll!itÂ»*d.
Already the result has been beneficial. !n
mosl of th" dairies wages have been bettered,
food Improved and decent sleeping quarters
provided.
A few dairymen, hwver. 'nrinK nothing
fnr tliÂ»ir men's rights to decent treatment iin.l i
fair wages, are stubbornly fighting the union.
in their opinion a milker is not entitled to ;<n\
of these things. The only thing that count*
with them is how to make us much mone' as
possible "'it r.f the toll and sweat of their
I fellow-men.
< inn of these unfair concerns is thÂ° San Pedro
1 nii'l X L I 'airy. All efforts to senure living con
ditions in thai dairy have failÂ«.l The union i
milkers there employed were summarllj dls
charged ami rpjilm-pii by cheap labor.
Now the milkers' union asks all fair minded
men and women to assist the milkers by refua
in* to buy the milk of the San Pedro and X I,
Dairy When men work like slaves nnd live ,
like slaves they are subjerf to many diseases; i
protect yourselves and at the same time assist
the milker!" by purchasing milk from union
dairies only. Respectfully,
THE MILKERS' ONION OF CALIFORNIA. |
James F. McAnllfCe, recording secretary I
of Iron Holders' Union No. Ifi4, addressed
the council at considerable length on the
question of eonvlct-made stoves which
have been pent t<"i this city from the
Oregon prison foundry.
In his explanation he stated that all
reputable foundries placed their trade
mark on the stoves made at their places,
whereas those made by convict labor had
no mark which designated the place of
manufacturing. He suggested that the
hill now pending before Congress, which
is intended to limit the sale of all prison
made goods to the State In which they
are made, should be supported by the
labor councils.
As a remedy against the sale of these |
convict-made stoves it was proposed to j
have committees appointed which would
wait on the smaller dealers and discour
age the sale of the objectionable article.
In conclusion, it was recommended that â 
"as :Â» means of identifying this trash we
suggest that you should see that the
manufacturer's name or the firm name is
cast in the plate, and not on a small nam<' j
plate which is screwed to some part of !
the stove. But we rely mainly on the re
tail dealers for relief, because if they re- j
fuse to carry BUch wares the penp'e will |
not look for "them."
A committee, consisting of J. W. Spen
cer M. Monahan and A. X. Andre, was !
appointed to wait on the commltt... of
arrangements for the French celebration
on the 14th of July and get the printing
Of all matter appertaining to that even!

FUTILE SEARCH
FOR A FATHER
WHO IS MISSING
Mrs. C. B. Thomas
Seeks Her Husband.
FAMILY LEFT IN DISTRESS
ACCIDENT CAUSES AN UNFORTU
NATE SEPARATION.
Mother and Three Children Left Des
titute in This City by the Dis
appearance of the
Father.
Living at the Salvation Army headquar
ters on Broadway and Montgomery street
are a mother and three small children,
destitute and without immediate hope of
a betterment of their condition. The
mothei is Mrs. C. B. Thomas, who has
been in this city for a month, searching
for her husband from whom she has been
separated by a most unfortunate mistake.
Early in May Mr. Thomas left Los An
geles, where lie had failed to make a liv
ing. He came to'this city, hopeful that
a new field would preseni letter oppor
tunities to secure work to support him
self Jim! family. His plan was to have
his wife and children leave Los Angeles
on the steamer which arrived In this city
on May L'4th. Circumstances made it Im
possible for Mrs. Thomas to quit her old
home and embark for this city on that
vessel. She was delayed ten days, at the
end of which time she and h<-r children
sailed from Los Angeles hmunl for San
Fra ncisco.
There was no doubt in her mind that
when >].â â  arrived here, her husband would
be on hand to give her protection and
a home. Upon disembarking Mrs. 'l homas
sought for her spouse in vain. With. h. r
children, ranging from :: to 11 years of
age .md burdened with luggage,, she
searched the wharves for many blocks
but no husband appeared. Mrs' Thomas
finally took lodging at the Golden Ragle
Hotel, but her purse was of the lightest
am! she was soon forced to ,-i-k for out
side assistance. The cast- was reported
to Chief of Police Lees, but no si^-ns of
the missing husband have a/, ye! heen
disovered.
lie wife is stronK in her belief that
; Thomas must have accepted a position
out of tow,,, thinking that she and her
children were still in I. oh Angeles. The
<;:><â  has been reported to the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. This organization, with' the
Woman's Shelter, have secured a tempo
rary home for the mother and children.
Mrs. Thomas is a comparatively young
â .\ â¢ man, of comely a~nearance and of
marked refinement. She is now peeking
employment and a home for her offspring,
, awaiting the appearance of their father.
In the Divorce Court.
A. R. Patterson was granted a divorce
from Wilhelmina Patterson yesterday mi
the ground of extreme cruelty. Decrees
of divorce have also been granted Gui
seppe Beccuti from Teresa Beccuti, on the
ground of desertion; Priscilla Campbell
from John Campbell, on the ground of
desertion; Thomas Ross from Clotilde
Ross, on the ground of willful desertion,
and Nellie r. Newbern from Samuel C.
Newbern, on the ground of desertion. An
order ha? heen mad< directing C. Lages
to pay Meta C. Lages alimony in the sum
of 540 a month. Mrs. Annie .1. Meuss
dorffer was granted a divorce from Harry
C. Meussdorffer on the ground of willful
neglect. Suits for divorce have been tiled
by Elsie Hummer against Wilson j.
Hummer for desertion, and Sibyl I. RlnmÂ«
against Jacob Blume for cruelty.

A; the last regular monthly meeting of
the board of managers of Pacific Asso
elation. Amateur Athletic Union, two
amendments to the constitution were pre
sented for consideration. The first of
these was that the hoard of manager 8
should consist of three delegates from
each club in the association and the sec
ond that no member of the board should
be permitted to bid for or to be in any
way pecuniarily interested In The medals
or other trophies given as prizes by thy
association. Both amendments were re
jected. It is, however, proposed to con
sult with the board of directors of the
Amateur Athletic Union and recommend
them to permit the board of the Pacific
Association to consist of three represent
atlyes from each affiliated club. Meetings
would then be better attended, and th?
work connected with regattas and other
e%'ents would be shared among a larger
number than at present.
The University of California will send
a crew into competition at the El Campo
rojmtta on the 25th inst. The crew is
made ;n> as follows: .1. Hopper, bow;

and is taking hold of the work in clever
style. To-morrow they will try the Pio

ATOS SA AND FILLY FOAL BY ORMONDE.
A youngster of Aristocratic Lineage.
IyiSPORTING about the broad acres of Sprecke/s' stock farm. Napa. is a two and a
y half month old foal which, if judged by its breeding and conformation, must develop
into a great race mare. This aristocratic youngster is by the unbeaten Ormonde,
out of Atossa, an Australian mare by Dun/op. A. B. Sprecke/s, owner of the mare, is
being congratulated on his good fortune, more especially as Ormonde is not so prolific a
sire as the many friends of W, 08. Macdonough would wish.
Ormonde was never defeated. As a two-year-old he started three times. He
started ten times as a three-year-old, winning the 2000 guineas, the Derby and the St.
Leger. In his four-year-old form he started three times, winning the Hardwick stake,
the Rous Memorial and the Imperial Cup. defeating such celebrities as Minting, Paradox,
Melton and Bendigo. While owned by the Duke of Westminster Ormonde sired Orme, sire
of Flying Fox, which won the English Derby of 1899. He also sired Llanthony. Orville,
Sorcerer. Orantes II and Goldfinch, sire of Lord Rosebery's peerless mare Che! and ry.
Goldfinch is owned by J. B. Haggin. master of Rancho del Paso. Sacramento. Ga/tee
More, winner of the Derby in 1898, is by Kendal. brother in blood to Ormonde. A writer
recently said of Ormonde's pedigree: "He is by a Derby winner from a mare by a Derby
w inner.' â  Atossa. Mr. Spreckels' mare, is by Dun/op, winner of the Melbourne Cap. two
miles, in 3:28 1-2. She is out of Catherine Wheel, half sister to Suwarrow, winner of
five of the greatest races decided in Australia,

Santa ciara College and has wonderful

Though his; Sunday was an open date
; on the Corinthian programme, nearly the
i whole fleet was out. Corinthian Cove,
i Paradise Cove and MoNVar's landing be
: ing the favorite spots for going ashore.
Commodore T. L. Hill cruised In the upper
bay, and the large schooners Lurllne, Ag
gie and Chlspa, the cutter Folly, and the
sloop Catherine, wore also under way.
Several of the California yachts accom
panied Commodore Allen M. day's Pac
tolus. among them being the sloops Occi
dent. Embla, Surf and V. & I. There was
a strong breeze in the channel and off
Marln Islands, but off El Campo the wind

The curtain fell on the last act of the
Pacific Yacht Club drama last Monday
when the home and otuer effects of the

On the last occasion the Californlas beat
the Pacifies by 9 runs on the first inning*
and on going in for the second time with
30 runs to make to win, secured them for
a loss of 3 wickets, thus winning the
match by 6 wickets, as the team was one
man short. To-morrow the California*

pour hundred Thousand pish to
Be Distributed by the pish
Commission.
The State Board ot Fish Commissioners
have commenced the distribution of Loch
Leven and German brown trout. F<m:
hundred thousand of the game fish will
be planted in Tahoe, Dormer. Inc'epon
dence and Webber lakes. The first ship
ment left Sisson Hatch<>ry last Wednes
day, consigned to Yosemite National
Park. The principal lakes within the
reservation will be stocked.
Experience has demonstrated that these
species of trout <lo much better in the
i lakes than in the streams, hence other va
j rietles will be used in the latter. The eggs
; from which those flsh were hatched were
! taken from the stock ponds at Slsson
Hatcherj". They are all in good condition
! ana excellent results arc expected.
Webber Lake was stocked with these
, varieties of trout some years share, and
j they have multiplied rapidly. Notii es
j were posted about the lake requesting
anglers to return all lish under one pound
in weight to the water As the lake is oft
the line of travel and frequented only by
genuine sportsmen, the request has been
respected. The notices have be< n re
moved this year as the tish is generally
well developed.
Alex Vogelsang, president of the Fish
Commission, is still in the Yosemite enjoy
ing the fishing and studying the condi
tions which the commissioners must meet.
Al dimming is spending his summer
vacation at Webber Lake, as has been his
custom for a number of years.
Advices received at the office of the
Fish Commission from E. W. Hunt, super
intendent of the Tv hoe Hatcherj ii
Tahoe, are to the effect that the fishing
i continues excellent.
Harry Babcock, E. J. McCutcheon,
j Charles Page. J. L. Xickel and Warren
Olney left on Thursday for the
I Williamson River, on the Klamath
i Reservation, Southern Oregon. The
; fishing is pronounced of the best
I quality by all the rod wlelders who
! have "fished in the Williamson.

BIG BOXERS
TO MEET SOON
Winner of the Ruhlin-Kennedy
Bout May Be Matched Against
Tom Sharkey.
Much interest centers around the meet
ing of Gus Ruhlin and Joe Kennedy, the
heavy-weight boxers, in Woodward's Pa
vilion npxt Friday night. If the winner
makes a creditable showing he may be
matched against Tom Sharkey. The lat
ter is never happy unless he has a fight
in prospect and may take a chance with
the victor just to keep in practice.
Kennedy's chances in the coming battle
are greatly fancied by his friends in this
city. He is a clever two-handed fighter,
and his gameness has never been ques
tioned. He acted as Sharkey's sparring
partner whll*Â» the sailor was preparing
for his meeting with Jeffries. This neces
sitated his taking a lot of punishment,
which he did with good grace. Hi- i-;
clever with his lpft hand, and boxing au
thorities all agree such a man i-- the
hardest to defeat. With" tin's hand he is
always playing for the body or face, and
repeated visitations wear out his oppo
nent.
Tom Sharkey, together with Spider
Kelly and others, will give a boxir.g ex
hibition at Salinas to-:dght
Tim McGratn will match Spider Kelly
against Nick Long's lightweight, Jack
Bennett.
Jimmy Anthony and Willie Cole may
meet again, weighing IIS pounds at the
ringside.
"Cocker" Tweedie. the erratic Austra
lian, has not gone East. He is mat I
to box Rufe Turner at Stockton July 3.
Grocer Bitter Triumphs.
The Federal Grand Jury yesterday Ig
nored the. charge against Carl E. Hitter
of having purchased Government blankets
from soldiers. Hitter is a grocer, with
his place of business near the Presidio
gates. He was arrested for having In his
possession a pair of blankets which ho
had obtained from two soldiers. His de
fense was that he had accepted the prop
erty as security for goods bought ox him

Splerjdid facilities Offered " hoot
Morjs" for Practice at the
Scotch Game.
The first nine holes of the full eighteen*
hole course of the San Rafael Golf Club
were thrown open to the members last
Saturday. More players were out on the
links both Saturday and Sunday than nn
miy previous days of the season. Amnrip
well-known members of the San Francisco
Golf Club who were at San Rafael may be
mentioned E. J. McCutcheon, S. L. Ab
bott Jr. and C. P. Eells. th*Â» first and last
of whom are also members of the San
Rafael club. The most important match
played was that between \V. W. Morrow
< and Captain Carter P. Pomeroy, am! was
won by the latter, who now stands third
!on the list. The new rules for club play
require all matches between the first ten
, players on the list to be eighteen-hoie
contests, and ties to be decided by a fur
-1 ther play of three holes. These rules are
,in accordance with the new regulations
m force in England.
Yesterday afternoon the open handicap
tournament of the Santa Catalina Island
: Golf Club began on the Avalon links, nine
holer; of the women's cumnetition being
played. The tournament will be con
tinued to-day, the women's ei^hteen-hole
, competition being finished and the thirty
six hole open handicap competition for
nieii being played out as far "as possible.
The Catalina Island course is exceedingly
I picturesque and involves some peculiar
1 difficulties in the form of steep rocks an<i
[ a thick growth of cactus. The difficulties
of the course are modified for the women
playt vs. It was expected that the men's
competition would attract at least forty
entries, including Stanley Bates, the pres-
I ent champion of the Catalina Tsland club;
M. E. Flowers of Riverside, who won thÂ«i
Santa Monica club handicap on June 10;
M. G. Burmester of Bnkersfield, and al
most all the host players of the Lros An

greenkeeper and instructor at the Coun
try Club links, will act as starter ar.il
refpree.
The club tournament of the Santa
Monica Golf Club was held last Saturday,

WHEELMEN ON THE ROAD.
The event of to-morrow in cycling will
be the five-mile handicap road race of the
California Cycling Club, to be held at 3
p. m over the course from San Mateo to
San Carlos. The record for this course
and distance is 12:03, and some of thÂ«
riders in to-morrows event confidently
expect to come tinder it. Captain Coulter
has arranged to take down a large run of
club members to witness the event.
The entries and handicaps are as fol
lows- William Juedt, 1:30; Fred Bent, 1:30;
Richard Welsh, 1:30: W. H. Reid, 1:15;
Jo^oh Holle. 1:15. A. Hougaard. 1:00; J.

Captain Bpillane, the younger, has ar
ranged a "blind run" for the members of
Olympic Wheelmen to-morrow. All the
members know is that they are to take
the 8 o'clock Sausalito boat, buy a ticket
to Ross station, and that from there on
they will have a pleasant ride of eleven
miles "over good roads and new scenery."
It is to be presumed they will enjoy riding
over the scenery.
The Bay City Wheelmen, under Captain
A. .1. Menne. will ride to Woodslde, in San
Mateo County, to-morrow, leaving the
clubhouse at 8 a. m. This is a splendid
trip, just far enough to be enjoyable with
out being tiresome, and a big crowd will
: doubtless take the ride.

in state in front of the sanctuary. The
casket was completely covered with, a
wealth of sweet peas and ferns, while nu
merous rtoral offerings wi re placed around
it.
l-< ng before the hour appointed for the
services the large edifice was crowded in
every part with the- parishioners, who
held their dead pastor in the highest
reverence. The steps and surrounding
sidewalks were occupied bj an immense
throng, which was unable to get inside

and Byrne, the assistant pastors of the
church. Th< deacons at the throne were

Rev. Father P. R. Lynch delivered the
funeral oration and paid a glowing tribute
to the deceased priest. His text was
"Sternal rest grant unto him, o Lord, and
!<â ( perpetual light shine upon him."
"In the death of Father Flood, 1 . 1 he said.
"the Catholics of the community have,
suffered a loss as w.ell as the members of
this parish. Father Flood was instru
mental In giving to ij'.c worship of God
this beautiful temple. I'pon him fell the
onerous task of seeing tq Its construction.
It called for many sacrifices, but, good
priest that he was, be did not hesitate.
Sensitive and bashful to a mark-' 1 , degrei
we who knew him realise how painful the
?e!f-imp< sed task was. Hut h- set about it
carry out hiÂ§ purp Â»c and h? accomplished
it. Mindful of God's honor and the wel
fare of those entrusted to his cart-, he
gave the best energies of his mind and
'body to the work In hand. He watched
over his offspring from cornerstone to
summit, and when it was completed his
h-art thrilled with a joy unknown to
.â thers.
"How different the occasion and with
what opposite feelings we are gathered
here this morning to the day when we
assembled to congratulate Father Flood
on the completion of this sacred edifi< c.
The face that was then Bushed with Joy
is now while in death, and now we are
sorrowing in our human way. \v.- would
have hoped to see Father Flood enjoy
years of peace and happiness dispensing
the mysteries of religion, but our ways

to take him away in the hour of his suc

a Named, devoted and jealous priest.
his brothers in the ministry a dear friend.
To the people of Sacred Heart his loss is
well nigh irreparable. This was his first
pastoral charge, and your sorrow is the
keenest. It is hard to realize that he who
enjoyed the tremendous power ,>i priest
hood now lies powerless !n death.
â¢'You are here in vast numbers to tes
tify the respect in which you hold his
memory. For you he (oiled and prayed,
and you are here for a higher and holier
purposeâ to pray for the peaceful and
happy repose ot his soul. A priest's life
is an' honored one. His privileges and re
sponsibilities .ire great. Do not cease to
pray for him, knowing th> se responsi
bilities.
â¢â¢We. prelate and people, gather before
God's altar to supplicati mercy on his
son!. Let our prayers not end to-day. The
grave is unable to s< ver the bonds which
hold us t>> him. By virtue of the consol
ing doctrine of the communion of saints
v. .'â¢ are still bound to him. L<-t us follow
him beyond the {.'rave with our prayers.
His death was truly happy. Our reverend
Archbishop gave to him In the holy viati
cum the last pledge of God's mercy to
him May his soul and the souls of the
faithful departed rest in peace."
Many of those present who heard the
touching words were deeply moved, and
silent tears were shed by grief-stricken
parishioners for thÂ«ir beloved pastor.
After the Archbishop had pronounced
absolution and sprinkled incense over the
casket it was lifted up by the pallbearers,

Grain Fire Near Lodi.
LODI, June 16. â About seventy acres of
standing wheat went up in flames on the
Peterr ranch, four miles south of here
this afternoon. The fire is supposed to
have started from a spark fs"m a pass
ing train. Other fields adjoining were
saved by thp bard work of farmers, who
plowed und^r strips of grain and fought
the flames in every way. The loss
amounts to $I'W.
Cocoanut by Mail.
One of the strangest packages which
has ever been bandied by the clerks in
the Waterville postofhVe was delivered to
S. S. Lightbody the other afternoon. The
package was a cocoanut in the same form
in which it was taken from the' tree.
There was no tag attached to the cocoa
nut, instead the address was written on
the. husk. One of the three sides of the
husk was taken up by the address, which
used up nearly all the space allotted for
it. Another side contained the postage
stamps. Of these there was one 5-cent
stamp, two 2-eent stamps, and, In spite
of the fact that the remaining stamp of
1 cent denomination was one of the
stamps issued in commemoration of the
Maine, there was plenty of room for many
more stamps of the same size, so large
was the surface. The cocoanut was sent
by Fred Gonyer. who several months ago
was employed at Mr. Ughtbody's store
Mr. Gonver is now in Palm Beach, Fla.â
Portland Argus.

ATTEMPTED TO
RUIN D .O. MILLS'
BEAUTIFUL ELMS
Telephone Company's
Arrogant Methods.
STOPPED BY AN INJUNCTION
A HIGH-HANDED PROCEDURE
MEETS WITH A REBUKE.
Attempt to Destroy the Prettiest
Stretch of the County Road.
Angry Property-Owners
Object.
The Sunset Telephone and Telegraph
Company, of which John I. Sabin is the
executive head, hns again attempted to
ride with an Iron-shod* hoof over the
rights of others and this time its cours-i
has been brought to a BUdden stop by thq
invocation of the law. Without warning
or notice the telephone company prepared
to lay lines over the property of D. O.
Mills, directly south of Millbrae. An in
junction issued by the. Superior Court of
San Matro County cut short the corpora
tion's designs and a most interesting law
suit will follow on account of the arro
gant manner in which the telephone com
pany has attempted to violate the prop
erty rights .if ]>. O. Mills.
D. O. Mills is acting through his repre
sentative and agent, H. H. Taylor, who
is not the only person an :--il by the ac
tion of the trespass^ rs. Along the county
road which runs southward from MillbraÂ«
there are a number of angry property
holders who will Dot stand by and see
the beautiful elms which skirt the road
before their land devastated and destroy
ed, by the ruthless operations of tht- com
pany's Unesmen. This avenue of elms
marks the prettiest stretch of road from
San Francisco to San Jose and has been
the work of the property ownÂ«rs at th<Â»
solicitation- of the county authorities.
Th>> trees were planted some \ears ago.
The telephone company, obtaining a fran
ehiSft, erected unsightly pi '. - betW< â¢
them with the cross-trees at th<= top and
some distance from the ground. Suddenly
and without apparent reason the corpora
tion determined to lower the cross-trees,
which, if accomplished, would necessitate,
the. disfigurement, if not the ultimate ruin.
of the beautiful elms which are tho pride
of the county.
H. H. Taylor said yesterday: "The tele
phone; company imagined that it could
sweep with high hand right over the land,
regardless of all others who happened to
he in its way. The officers of that com
pany have made a mistake, that is all.
T'nleÂ«s the courts permit them to dn us
they desire, they will not cross tho?.- ma
jestic, ornamental elms with their lowered
cross-trees. As it is the t<ip cross-trees do
s.im>- damage. T was not consulted by the
telephone company when' it determined to
erect Its latest nuisance."
Relative to the company's contemplate'^.
action it is said th;!t John I. Sabin, ex
pressed an opinion which is most charac
teristic of the company's general de
meanor. When he wa? advised to recall
the orders given his linesmen to put on
the lower cross-trees h*> refused to do bo,
asseverating that he would do just ns ha,
pleased and that nobody could stop him.
The law has been effective so far and
until the injunction is removed Mr. Sa
hin's new cross-trees will not decorate his
poles or tend to ruin the elms on the road
before the D. O. Mills' property.

EASTERN MARKETS.
â  IRK STOCK MARKET
NEW YORK, June 16.â There was a num
ber of small .stocks whose prlces.were marked
up at the opening to-day, snd :or which buy
ing demand existed at intervals during the
day. The coalers were conspicuous, especially
the Reading lesues, and they rose on an aver
age of about IV4 points. The Flower group
also moved upward and gave seme semblance of
strength to I h<- general market Aside from
this demand, the market was almost wholly
neglected anil in the hands fir a small coterie
i f professional traders. The utmost endeavors
nf these operators did not serve to move prices
more than a small fraction, except In a few
....... advance in the coalers was
Hetty well held. It was attributed to the
return from Europe of a prominent financier,
who has figured In many railroad reorganiza
tions and to the closing out of options on
Lehlgh Valley by sympathetic control. Some of
these railroads displayed a rather firm tone
in sympathy with Reading, but the movement
of prices In them was inconsequential. The
advance in the Flower stocks was not so well
and in some of them was more than lost before
the day was over. Prices moved up and down
over a range of about :t nts. and closed
with a :small net loss. New York Air Brake
made a characteristic skyrocket Jump if IS
j.i.jniF.
Colorado Southern first preferred dropped - a Â«.
presumably on account of the labor troubles in
tliÂ« State. Metropolitan ranged over i i>oints,
but ilused .-it a small Change. 'I here was noth
ing in the general situation thai found any re
flectlon in th? stock trading. 'i" undertone
was rather firm In the railroad list, partly in
sympathy with the .strength of individual
Mocks already mentioned. The announcement
of an additional shipment by to-morrow's
ficamr of $1,000,000 In gold was without In
fluence in the trading, unless it might have
lÂ»ee-i a feature In discouraging activity. In
fluence In the same direction was the expecta
tion of an unfavorable bank statement to-mor
low. Last Saturday's shipments. as well as
tlKiÂ«e mnii" early in the we.-k. will all figure In
to-morrow's statement, but not to-day's en
gagement. The banks are said to have lost
cash In other ways luring the week and a
large decitnr In t^at Item is expected In to
morrow's statement.
The amount of^loans cannot hp forecasted,

BRADSTREETS FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 16.â Bradstreet's Finan

i latlve movements, Manipulation, however, ap
| peared to be mainly responsible for the ad
i vances and bear selling and demand realizing
|of profits by trader? for the declines, l'rofes
i sional Influences were predominant and the

which have been In circulation about the large
interests being committed to the bull side and

! prices having failed to Ing on any appie

on dividend paying stocks. On the other hand,
' uncertainty in repaid to the crops and the out
i come a.= to railroad tannage and earnings is
! -till sufficiently prominent to exert a re
! Htrictive itifluf-nce "ii speculation. The irreÃu
j larity in crop estimates m this portion of the
' year is rather more pronounced than for some
â .â .i^t. and is In many quarters consld-
I ereU a good reason for waiting "ii the part of
I the large speculative Interests. Some of the
i latter have Indeed given support to their spe
cialties, but others have been active on the
bear side, although In all operations of that
character at present the' disposition Is to cover
for small profits. Europe has not been a factor
in .air rrarkets, the London participation being
I small her? and equally divided between buying

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, June 16.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say:
Weather and crop conditions figure to 8
greater extent than usual this week, not only
in the domain of actual distribution, but in
their . effect on values of staples, particularly
agricultural products, a majority of. which are
i higher. Noteworthy in this respect is wheat,
! which has advanced on Government and other
reports, pointing, according to some, to 560.000.
--000 bushels, and by others rated as low as
500.000,000 bushels. The possibility i!Â« also pre
! center! of spring wheat, for the first time on
; record, equaling if not exceeding In yield that
â¢ of the winter sown grain, owing to the severe
i weather last winter and insect damage to the
; latter crop since then. Particularly helpful,
however, in advancing prices have been the
i reports of widespread damage to the Russian
j crop, less glowing spring wheat reports from
the Northwest, and tentative estimates of the
I world's crops pointing to 250,000,000 to 350.000.
--â  000 bushels smaller than in IS9S. Oats and other
i small cereals have sympathized with wheat,
I particularly as acreage and condition figures
; point likewise to diminished yields. Hog pro
i dusts have shared the strength of cereals, but
: cotton remains unchanged, notwithstanding re-
I ports of decreased acreage and very fir i*. con
j ditions in the manufactured goods trad", rath
] <-r reflecting, in fact, reports of improved crop
| conditions at the South as the result of the
; breaking of the dry spell in the Gulf States.
I The crop, however, is still backward. Ad-
I vices as to the distributive trade are in the
main very favorable. Hot weather has Ftlm-
I ulated retail business and orders for fall de
-1 livery Hie reported in larger volume and
i earlier than for years past. At some centers.
I 111 fact, less than the usual effect Ik looked
j for in seasonable midsummer influences. This
is, however, best Illustrated in the iron and
steel trade, which displays unexampled ac
tivity as regards Bummer production and con-
I sumption, limited only by the obtaining; of
I supplies. Advances along the line are In the
futures trade. Predictions of a further ad
l vane* in the price of rails are made, based
upon the fact that old contracts at very low
i rates have now been nearly filled. Notwith
standing these advances, there is still some
ex;. ..it inquiry, Â»nd a feature reported has
been .one ,on Continental account for Ameri
can coke. Iron ore shipments, although the
[ season is three weeks late, nearly equal those

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, .Tune 16.- R. G. Dun & Co.'s
; weekly review of trade will nay to-morrow:
| it is on* nt the frequent paradoxes of busi
ness that thÂ« one thing which now makes
I prices rise is the only thing that clouds the
: future. They rise In iron and wheat because

longed and real, would much impair pros-
I perity. In wheat it doea not seem to be real
: nor In Iron lasting;, and meanwhile other elel
ments of prosperity continue potent. It la a

iln imports. In eleven months the excess of
i merchandise exports have been J495.000.000 and
the bankers estimate that $2*0.000.000 worth of
securities have been returned from Europe
with so few in recent months that the amount
remaining to be dislodged is probably small
The scarcity of Iron Is real, in spite of the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June 16.â Wheat showed a decided
weakness at the start. September opening at
from 77Vci7 v . compared with yesterday's clos
ing prices of 7S'--c. Traders were evidently
much disappointed at the poor response of Eu
] ropean markets to yesterday's advance here.
i Liverpool, which showed up well at the pen
| Ing there, reported only about %d advance at
I 1:30 p. m. Paris was up only sÂ©lo centimes.
The sluggishness of the foreign markets
strengthened the suspicion formed yesterday
that European crop damage reports were prob
ably somewhat exaggerated. Domestic n^ws
as a rule was fully as bearish as the foreign.
Selling on a iirsf scale commenced shortly
after the opening, and with the exception of
temporary interval" kepi up throughout the en
tire session. Many of yesterday's big buyers
dumped their wheat back. About II o'clock
there was a let-up in the liquidation, due to
the better tone of closing Liverpool cables, and
September rebounded to 78'fec, the high point
of the day. The market soon after became ex
tremely heavy on persistent selling. September
finally getting down to 77!Â£c. It rallied to 77% c
i at the close.
Corn as n whole was firm, but showed s.me
' sympathetic weakness with wheat. September
closed (Â»c lower. :â  .
': Oats were quite active and firm for Septem
i ber, but rather weak for July. September
closed a shade higher.
Provisions were slow all day. T/oriÃ-s let go
to some extent on the wheat weakness and
lower hot: prices, selling being heavy enough
to cause some recession In prices. At the close

MANY AGED
OFFICERS MAY
BE RETIRED
Several Have Passed
the Age Limit.
iHOREY IS SUPERANNUATED
PENSION LIST SOON TO BE IN
CREASED.
Some Are Anxious to Be Left in Har
ness Till They Have Served
Long Enough for a
tension.
Oakland Office gan Francisco Call,
PIS Broadway. June 16.
Tt is not unlikely that many of the aged
policemen may be retired in a few weeks,
The matter is under consideration and the.
jnly objection to the retirement of several
officers is that it will add materially to
:he pension fund able out of the city
Ireasury.
In addition to Messrs. Barnett, Chase
r.'id Cole, who each draw $y> per moni.i
'rom the pension fund. Chief Fletcher will
be added to the list on July 1. His pen
sion will be $S7 50. I'nder the law at pres
ent in force which provides that a police
man must be GO years of age and must
have served twenty years continuously
before he is entitled to half-pay pension,
there is but one man. Detective Shorey,
a.t present ahle to claim ibis amount.
There ore in the department several
men over sixty years of age. but none of
them have served the necessary twenty
sears. B. R. Phillips is 61 years old. out
has not seen twenty years of regular
service. Frank Greenwald is 63 yea I old
and has seen over eighteen years of rv
!ce. 11. B. Hand is 7'< years old, but lacks
the service qualification to secure a pen
sion. In addition to these there are some
who have seen over twenty years of serv
ice but are not old enough. Captain Wil
fon is ."4. with twenty-seven years' serv
ice. Bailiff Mitchell is 57. P. E. Mines Is
;..". Henry McCloy is 52; Henry Nedder
man is ,V 7. and has served twenty-three
and a half ears. D. W. Swain is 58.
Every member of Ihe police force con
tributes J2 per month to the police pen
sion fund. There ire sixty-one paying
members, and this produces $122 per
month. The pension lift Is now $1! rer
month; after July 1 it will he $237 50 per
month and if Detective Shorey he retired
ho will be entitled to ?.,2 50 ncr month.
There ;ire about six officers who have
from one to four years to serve before
they are entitled to pensions. Should they
be retired at this time on account of the
a?--> limit they would consider it a great
hardship, and the commissioners are un
decided as to whether â â  is proper to re
tire them now or to allow them to remain
In the service until they shall be able to
;!r?w half pay from the city treasury for
I â  balance of their lives.
RECTOR LAW'S PAY
MAY BE REDUCED
VESTRY DETERMINED THAT HE
SHALL RESIGN.
The Latest Disagreement Is With His
Senior Warden and Friend,
J. J. Valentine.
Oakland CMRcp Fan Francisco < "all.
.'â¢KM* Broadway. June I*.
ThÂ» existing differences between Rev.
Marshall Law and his vestry, the details
of which wore published exclusively by
The O:!l one month ago. appear to be !
reaching a crisis. The demand made upon \
the rector last Tuesday for his resigna- |
tion, also published exclusively In this
paper; has been scouted by Hoy. Marshall
Haw and further trouble Is threatened.
The friends of the rector In the vestry
have gradually left him. and now that j
J.^J. Valentine, his senior warden, has
retired. Mr. Law lias Â» difficult fight on
hand: Although according to ecrl.*siasti
cal law he <\-mnot be removed from his
parish; except for some cross offense, it
is within the power of the vestrymen to
â¢ nt the salary of their rector to a nomi
nal sum and thus starve him out of the
pulpit. This threat has even been made
by one of the church officers.
Dr. Law is defiant. 11 . declares that
many small matters have been magnified,
and that there is no .-.â â â¢. reason why
he should resign from the Church of the
Advent.
Dr. Law attributes much of his trouble
to Mr. Read, the treasurer. He says Mr.
Head has been a disturbing element for
a lonp time, and pays but ?1 a month for
a whole pe.w in the very best portion of
the churrh. Mr. Head says that when he
pors to ehurrh he wants to hear ser
mons, and not advertisements for patent

on everything but the gospel. The trou
ble has been brewing for two years, and
now the churrh is r>-nt entirely asunder,
with those who have supported it on one
side and the rector on the other.
The most s.-nsational incident In the
whole affair was a suppressed "explana-
ion" which the rector announced he
would read to his flock one Sunday morn
ins: several months ago. Dr. Law had
heard disquieting rumors regarding his
habits, and he determined that it was
time to dose the mouths of his accusers.
When Sunday morning came in- an
nounced that he had been advised by his
friends n"t to â¢earl It. II contents were
known: and it was a very positive denial
on the part of Dr. La that he had used
in any form any drug whatsoever. He
offered to supply all kinds of proofs and
to give any reasonable reward to any
body who could prove otherwise. His
friends assured the rector that it would
be folly to read this statement from he
pulpit "in answer to what they believed
was a lot of foundationless gossip.
Ah the matter stands, the rector's resig
nation has been demanded and he has
boon offered a holiday on full pay til!
October 31. He has so far. declined to
resign and defies the vestry to put him
out.
1 ir. Law says he onor< d Mr. Valentine
by making him senior warden. Mr. Val
entino, acording to the rector, says he
ronld not ne thus honored. The rector
ulso suggests that his salary is very small
and that the wealthy pconle of the
fhurch; while they have done much to
ornament their place of worship, have
docn very little to make their rector's
family comfortable. h
WORK OF A FIREBUG.
No Doubt the Old Barracks Was De-
liberately Fired.
OAKLAND, June 16.â Investigation!
of the old Salvation Army barracks, â 
where fire was discovered at midnight, |
confirms the suspicion that the place was {
prepared for burning by an incendiary. |
In the garrer.were a five-gallon can of |
gasoline; another J gallon an and a gallon
demijohn, all filled with gasoline. The I
five-gallon ran was lying on Its side and 1
had a diamond shaped hole three Inches
long cut In the. upper side. The demi
john had the cork out and the gallon can
had what appeared to be a pii cc of soft
Cough over the orifice at the ton Near 1
the cans were found several lamp wicks '
sewed together with one end burned It I
i* the opinion of Chief Ball that they
originally led to the gallon can of gaso
line, but they were disturbed in putting
out th* fire. h
Thf lower floor of the big building is
occupied by Professor Elsenbach who
hn3 recently obtained a permit from the
Fire Warden to erect a steam plant to j
manufacture chemicals. Fire Chief Ball
pays the incendiary must be some one !
interested in getting the building out of
the ay. as the professor has not a cent j
of insurance on his plant.

DIVORCED MEN
HAVE FORMED A
DEFENSIVE CLUB
A Unique Alameda
Organization.
IT IS OUT AGAINST MARRIAGE
BOASTS THAT IT IS DOING
MISSIONARY WORK.
_____
Fhe President Explains Why
Some of the Members Have
Joined the New
Body.
AI.AMEDA. June 16.â A Lumber of the
men of this city who have made matri-
m ony a failure ami have had their nuptial
ties 'severed by the processes of the di
vorce courts have formed an organization
! with objects practically the same as the
defunct Bachelors' Club.
The Divorced Men's Club of Alameda is
not of very recent origin. Its founder was
the late A. W. yon Schmidt, who mur
dered his wife after the law had stepped
i between them and then took his own life.
â  When Yon Schmidt was first served
. with a divorce complaint he called to
; gether a number of men who had already
' passed through the divorce mill, and sug
i gested that they form an anti-matrimo
j nial club. He admitted they were all
I divorced men, but fully remarked that
! the chances were he would soon be one of
â  them.
When he was legally separated from his
wife he revived the idea and the Alameda
! Divorced Men's Club sprang into life. Yon
j Schmidt was the first president and Ward
Battles was named (or secretary. So
ciability was all the club pretended at the
j start. Then it merged Into a mutual con
i solation combination, and finally It was
advanced thai the welfare of mankindâ
i from a divorced man's point of view â
j should be looked after. Every member
i became a self-constituted committee of
! one to dissuade any one suspected of
j matrimonial inclinations from taking a
, step which, to the members of the club,
was so fraught with danger
Yon Schmidt's bloody deed left a va
cancy In the board of officers, which was
filled by the election of Stanley Stephen
i son, a well-known business man, i" the
position of president.
In an Interview this evening with a
' Call correspondent Secretary Ward Bat-
I ties said:
"Yes, we have a Divorced Men's Club
i in Alameda and we have among our mem-
I bers some of the best known men of the
city. We hold regular meetings, at which
we sympathize with those who are mar
ried and congratulate ourselves on Ing
free. Aside from sociability our object
lis to Impress upon mankind the dan-
I gers of matrimony and to give those In
clined that way an opportunity to profit
by our sad and harrowing experiences.
"Among our members are Stanley Ste
! phenson, James Kellenberger. Joseph
: Maristaney, Baron Alfred baroteau, G.
! Lowenthal; John Fay and numerous oth
' . rs. We have ati application on hand
; from Ben Hill, whose wife is suing him
| for divorce.
"Our experiences have been decidedly
I varied. Stephenson's wife did not want
â  him to smoke, and when he Insisted there
i was trouble which ended in a separation.
Maristaney was not satisfied with one ex
! perienee In matrimony, but tried it sev
i eral times before he got enough, and now
; fog j s on e of our most enthusiastic mem
â  bers. Baron Barbteau's wife claimed that
â  <=he paid the honeymoon expenses, and
i kept reminding him of it for several
! years" He go! mud at her and sh.> sued
â  him for a divorce. He made no contest
and has been happy ever since. He Is
1 the steward of our club.
"My wife objected because I made a
: noise* in the â  liar with a lot of t!7i cans
She thought it was burglars. She caller
i that cruelty, and appealed to the courts
to get rid of me. 1 have no fault to lind
with my present happiness. , â 
"Our club is doing a great deal of good
lin preventing men from allowing their
love to get the better of their judgment.
' Several men who thought of getting mar
-1 pled have ... by our missionaries,
and we intend to push the good work
along. The Divorced Men's Club has
come to stay."

The City Council will probably be sorry
thai it sent a request for answers on cer
tain municipal problems : i the socialist
Labor party. Having thus "laid the foun
dation" for th<- introduction of opinions
regarding Oakland'- municipal govern
ment the Socialists have taken advan
tage of it to address a very Interesting
reply to the Mayor and Councllmen.
The questions sen; out by the < "ouncll
were discussed at a regular business
mooting of the S iciallsi Labor party.
The answer contains more than those
srontlemen anticipated. Ii heartily favors
all necessary public Improvt ni'-nts and
condemns the present free library as
"small, ugly. unsaft . lacking necessary
accommodation and being dangerously
near to a flre trap." The Socialists ac
knowledge the faults of the present City
Hall, but in view of the probable organ
ization of the ciry and county of Oak
land, do not devise rebuilding at present.
â¢'And. moreover," says the document,"
the Oakland section thinks that at the
present time more important matters
need the first attention of the Mayor and
Council."
It refers to municipal ownership of gas
and water and reminds the Council of its
pledges regarding a water supply. Ref
erence Is made to the fact that there was
evidence recently hefore Mayor I'helan of
San Francisco that gas could be manu
factured al Co rents a thousand feet, ami
that the price in this city is now more
than twice that. The reporl proceeds:
"The city of Oakland borrowing money
at low rates of Interest could, after ere
atinp a sinking fund which would in a
term of years liquidate the original debt,
s.-U water to all its citizens at reasonable
rates and still have a surplus available
for public Improvements. Gas sold slight
ly above cost of production would become
the light of the poor man. and the kero
sene lamp miKh; be relegate '1 to the coun
try districts. Lower gas and water rates
would then so lessen the burden of the
taxpayers as to iustlfy the assumption of
a debt for the purpose of i recting needed
public buildtngs.
"Oakland Section is not in favor of seii
inp any land now belonging to the city.
It considers such action would be prejudi
cial to the best Interests of the commun
ity and contrary to the trend of social
evolution; the movement of society being
toward the public ownership of all prop
erty." _______^ â â

ARMY OFFICER IN TROUBLE.
Captain Carrington's Confidence Was
Evidently Betrayed by a Friend.
Apparentlj through a breach of onfi
upon the part of Borne man, whom
Lpa he considered a. friend, Captain
]â¢. 1 1. L.. Carrington of the First Infan
try. now stationed at Vancouver Bar
racks, but at present under orders to re
join his regiment in Cuba, may be gotten
Into serious trouble, which there was
peel of his avoiding. The
fficer arc yet hopeful that
ay be able to steer clear of any en
tanglement with the "War Department by
â  his lnd< btedness, an<l that he
be able to keep clean his name and
reputation as an officer by meeting all
of hi* obligations. Captain Carrlngton is
known in San Francisco, having been
ined for a number ol ;. ears at tho
lio with the First Infantry, and also
because ol his connection with the Na
il Guard of California as Inspector
and Instructor. He was very prominent
in military affairs here last spring, being
who musirred the First and
Seventh California regiments into ser
borne an excellent
reputation ;<s an efficient officer, and was
liked because of his jovial nature.
Like many other men, Captain Carrlng-
I good living and enjoyed
a game of poker. His inclinations along
Ines unfortunately led him into
ile, as his pay was not sufliciently
â¢ meet tin- obligations that he in
terred. As a member of the Rohemian
Club, it is said that Captain Carrington
â : jt poker for high stakes, and that
:,r- made personal obligations that he w;ls
not prompt in meeting and sum-' of which
not as yet been paid. It is also said
thai he made Mils with various trades
people winch he has not paid. The exact
amount of his Indebtedness his friends
will not state, but one of them said last
night there wen' plenty of members of
Bohemian Club who could pay the
entire amount without the slightest in
convenl<
Last Bummer, when Captain Carrington
wit:; made lieutenant colonel of the Kighth
California Regiment, he was ordered to
iuver Barracks, and when that regi
ment was mustered out he was retained
there <'ti special duty. Recently he was
ordered to rejoin his regiment, and be
ing harassed by his obligations, which
he was unable to meet, and also being de
sirous of leaving a. clean sheet behind
him, he applied to his friends in this city
for assistance. Ho wrote to William
Greer Harrison of the Bohemian Club, re
questing him to see some of his friends
and endeavor to raise the money for him,
promising that he would refund it from
ii!s pay as soon as he was able.
Mr. Harrison, when seen last night and
asked if it was true that he had received
a letter from Captain <'arrington,
made the following statement:
â¢t';ipt;;in Carrington wrote me some
time ;iko and told me of his financial dif
â â â¢ s. and asked me to see if I could
not get iiis friends to assist him, as lie
was umler orders to rejoin his regiment
di sired to pay all of his obligations
â  doing bo. As be stated the mat
ter was urgent and the time short, I
wr< !â¢ him and asked him for a list of
the names of his intimate friends. He
me seventeen name?. Twelve of the
â¢ men J knew personally and I saw
To the remaining live I addressed
i a] letters, Btatlng the facts and re
ling their assistance in the matter.
"From one of these five I believe the
unfortunate affair leaked out. Our object
pool Uk- captain's indebtedness and
each of his friends pay an equal share.
It was not bo large an amount but that
my one of us might have paid it without
serious inconvenience. Everyone liked
Captain Carrington, and we were only too
willing to help him out of his trouble. I
Know of nothing against him except that
he lived beyond his mean's. As tor the
gay life that he is reported to have led,
there is nothing more in it than that he
was fond of having a good time. I have
wired him that some one of his friends
has betrayed his confidence. The matter
of helping the captain out of his trouble
lias been about completed, and 1 am yet
hopeful that everything will come out
right as it Is."
Adjutant General Babcock when seen
last night in regard to the matter said:
"I know nothing of Captain Carrlngton's
trouble except what I have seen in the
paper. Of course the army regulations
are very strict against an officer going in
debt, but as far as I know there Is no
trouble impending for the captain at De
partment Headquarters. Thore has been
no orders for a court martial as suggested
in the published accounts of the affair,
and as far as I know the department has
no official knowledge of Captain Carring
ton's trouble, and it is certain that no
official action has been taken in the mat
ter."
It is well known that Captain Carring
ton has been harassed by his debts, and
upon a former occasion he was helped
out of his difficulties by his friends. Gen
eral Shafte-r being out of th<Â» city it could
not be learned If any trades people have
lodged complaints against Captain Car
rington at Department Headquarters. The
army officers here are inclined to look
upon the captain's trouble as an un
fortunate and premature publication of
an unnecessary matter. They all feel
sorry that he has gotten into the present
trouble, but th^y are hopeful that he will
be able to escape from his present diffi
culty without any serious inconvenience
through the assistance of his friends. It
Is said that the total amount owed by the
captain will not exceed $3000. Mr. Har
rison also stated that he felt confident
that the publication of Captain Carring
ton's present trouble had been actuated
by personal spite upon the part of some
one, and that as a consequence he thought
his friends would rally ail the more quick
ly to his assistance.
A special to The Call last night from
Vancouver Barracks says that Captain
Carrington refused to talk when seen by a
CaJl correspondent, but he stated positive
ly that no charges had b^en preferred
against him. Captain Carrington is a
member of the Arlington Club of Portland
and is well thought of there. His friends
In Portland declare that he has no bad
habits whatever.

made. Had Mr. Goodfellow purchased the ex-yacht Jessie he would have
sold La Paloma for half the money he has received as he only paid $l. r >oo
for her. But when he saw the Jessie, now a pilot boat on the Columbia
River, he decided not to buy her and came back to Ran Francisco. The
La Paloma will remain in San Francisco for the yachting season and will
then be Eailed to Honolulu.
THE SAINT FKA3S CISCO CALL, SATURDAY. JUNE IT, 1899.
WINE MAKERS
FINALLY REACH
AN AGREEMENT
Formulate and Adopt
, a Contract.
PROVIDES FIVEYEAR COMPACT
SIGNATURE SWILL BE SOLICITED
NEXT WEEK.
If Fifty -Five Per Cent of the Produc- '
ers Do Not Combine the Big Cor
poration Will Be Dis
banded.
The convention of wine-makers to de
cide upon the future of the California
"Wine-makers' corporation held Its third
meeting yesterday afternoon to hear the !
report of the committee on resolutions i
and contracts. The committee was com
posed of W. J. Hotchkiss, C. F. Monteal
agre, R. C. Terry, E. W. Putnam, G. C.
Hussman, R. T. Pierce. L. Feusler, "Wil-
Ham Rued and William Bornhorst. Their j
report was somewhat voluminous and j
dealt with the technical difficulties that '
have confronted the members and the !
board of directors in the past five years.
It recommended several changes calcu
lated to improve the business methods of
the corporation and after some discussion
was adopted.
Aside from the contract the suggestions
to the directors favor the organization of
district associations, to be comprised of
dry wine-makers who are ready to sign
the contract and take an Interest in pro
motlng not only the welfare of their own j
section but of the whole industry. The !
report further recommends the calling of !
an annual meeting to elect directors for j
the current year, with the following ap
portionment: Sonoma 2, Alameda and ;
Contra Costa 1, Napa 1. Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz 2, and 3 at large, making a
total of 9. :
The contract over which there has been
so much trouble calls for another live
years' agreement and binds the signer to
sell all the product of his vineyard, or i
wines that may be made for him, in the
years 1890 to 19<)3 inclusive. The price to
be paid for the wine of each vintage (
shall be the average price per gallon re- !
celved for standard wines of the same I
vintage by the corporation upon the sale i
thereof, less a pro rata proportion of the
expense of conducting the business of
said corporation. One-twentieth of the
soling price of the wine is to be paid in
fully paid up shares of the corporation.
It is the business of the board of directors
to determine the average price of stand- j
ard wine of each vintage, according to the ;
average price received for said wines, j
For line wines an extra price is provided. I
An Important feature of the contract ar
ranges for the advance of money on mer
chantable wines in the maker's cellar
prior to their going into consumption.
<In Saturday next the, delegates will
present these contracts to the wine-mak
ers of the various districts for their sig
natures, and it is provided that if the
names of 55 per cent of the producers is
not secured it will be the duty of the di- \
rectors of the corporation to return the
contracts to the signers. In this event
the compact would be broken, and the ;
makers of wines would have to go into '
the open market individually to lind
buyers for their goods.
While the labors of the convention ap
pear to have been satisfactory, there does
not seem to be any feeling of confidence
that the necessary number of growers can
be secured to the corporation. The diffi
culty Is that wines are bringing better
prices than have been realized for many
years, and there are certain growers who
have an idea that they could do better
if they were free to go Into the market
us competitors. Whether or not there are
enough of this class to prevent the reor- ;
ganization of the corporation remains to
be seen. However, it is an anxious
period, not only for the producers but for
merchants, as it Is pretty generally be
lieved that the abandonment of the com- j
bine would result in the fall of priced to
the old ruinous figures.

SCENES IN CUBA'S CAPITAL.
James W. Erwin Delivers an Illus
trated I/ecture in Metropolitan
Temple.
Standing room was at a premium at
Metropolitan Temple last night, when
James W. Erwin, president of the Cali
fornia Camera Club, delivered his illus
trated lecture on "What I Saw in Cuba's
Capital." Mr. Erwin has recently returned
from Havana, where he assisted in re-es
tablishing the postal system of the island
on American lines. While there he made
excellent use of his time and opportunities
to observe the various phases of Cuban
and Spanish life, aiso securing a large
number of photographs of scenes in and
about the city.
Mr. Erwin' s lecture was both instruc
tive and entertaining and was warmly ap
preciated by the vast audience, as was
evidenced by the frequent outbursts of
applause, which was especially emphatic
and prolonged when pictures of the graves
of the victims of the destruction of the
battleship Maine, decorated with Ameri
can flags and hidden beneath great
masses of flowers, were shown upon the
screen.
During the intermission little Miss Hazel
Callaghan favored the gathering with a
series of "coon" songs and dances in an
artistic and realistic manner that brought
down the house. The lecture was given
under the auspices of the Camera Club.
THOUGHT SHE WAS AN HEIRESS
Henrietta Redmond Arrested for Ob-
taining Goods by False Pretenses.
Henrietta Redmond, or Sheehan, was
arrested yesterday on a warrant charging
her with obtaining goods by fals" pr< -
tenses. The complaining witness is E. J.
Dollard, bookkeeper in the City of Paris
dry poods store. It was alleged that
the girl purchased a bill of poods
amounting to $40 70 on June 10 by repre
senting that she was a daughter of Airs.
Redmond, and ordered the goods sent to
Mrs. Burns, 944 Hampshire street. The
firm made Inquiries and claimed that the
girl's representations that she was a
daughter of Mrs Redmond were false.
Attorney Martin, who represents the
defendant, pays that her name is Shee
han, but whin she was a child she was
adopted by Mr. and Mrs. James Ked
mnnd. who owned property at 231, 233 and
235 Eddy street worth about $50,000. Red
mond d-ied without leaving a Will and his
adopted daughtei received nothing from
the estate. About a month ago she found
life so unpleasant at home that she went
to live wirh her married sister .it :*44
Hampshire street, and ordered the arti
cles from the '-â tore, believing that Mrs.
Redmond would pay for them.
FLAT DENIAL
BY THE
Mutual Electric Light Co.
Referring to an article In The Pan
Francisco Call of June 16, the Mutual
Electric Light Company makes this
public statement:
No officer, employe or other person
was ever authorized by this company
to offer Mr. Phelps or any other person
one dollar to procure any right, privi
lege or franchise.
His statement that he was offered by
this company $:!000, or any other sum,
is absolutely false.
On an appeal of this company to the
Supreme Court of this State, in Its opin
ion the court said: "If it were ever
proper to interfere with the discretion
vested in the officers of the city In the
constant supervision and control of the
streets in this mode, it may be ad
mitted that a stronger case is not likely
to arise. * * * In the use of this dis
cretion, which must exist somewhere,
great injustice may be done by officials
who are corrupt or partial, and I have
no doubt that a remedy may be ob
tained in the courts. Â» â¦ â¢ The rem
edy would seem to be in the compelling
of the granting of a permit in a proper
case. The wrong consists in refusing
it to the plaintiff when it ought to be
granted, and under such circumstances
as it is freely granted to the favored
corporations."
Upon this hint of the Supreme Court
this company brought an action of
mandamus against the Board of Su
pervisors. The ca.se was tried before
Judge Seawell, Franklin K. Lane, Esq.,
City and County Attorney, appearing
and representing all of the Supervis
ors, Supervisor Phelps alone appearing
by special counsel. The court rendered
a judgment directing a writ of mandate
to issue against the Board of Supervis
ors compelling them to grant the re
quested privilege to this company. The
City and County Attorney advised the
board that they had no case to appeal,
but they employed special counsel and
did appeal. And if the appeal had not
subsequently been dismissed by them
selves the Supreme Court would un
doubtedly have rendered an opinion
in accordance with iUs own opinion pre
viously rendered and sustained the
opinion of Judge Seawell.
That opinion is now the law of the
case; and had no permit been granted
to this company the law and decision
of th>Â» court directing the writ of man
date to issue would compel that it be
now granted.
On the face of these facts it is absurd
to consider that this company should
have resorted to illegal means to ob
tain that which was lawfully its own.
Before the election Mr. Phelps open
ly, and with an apparent earnestness,
advocated that the right be granted
to the Mutual Electric Light Company
to erect poles outside the fire limits,
and he promised the friends of that
company to vote to grant that privilege
when elected. After election Phelps
was suddenly converted, and voted
steadily for the gas and electric mo
nopoly. If offered money, it looks as
though he took it: his vot^s point un
mistakably to the source from whi^h
I he got it. â¢
THE STARBUCK STRUCK
AN UNCHARTED ROCK
DECISION BY CAPTAINS BOLLES
AND BULGER.
Master Brugiere Navigated the Ves
sel in a Careful and Skillful
Manner and Is Exoner
ated From Blame.
Captains Bolles and Bulger rendered a
decision yesterday in the matter of the
loss of the steamship Starbuck off the
coast of Nicaragua on February 27 of this
year, in which they exonerated Captain
c. J. Brugiere, the master, from all
blame. The inspectors found that the
fctarbuck at the time she struck was
about four miles off shore and from eight
to ten miles southeast of Consequina
Point. The chart of the coast in that lo
cality as issued by the hydrographic of
fice of the United States navy and cor
rected to November, 1897, shows from
twelve to fourteen fathoms of water four
miles off shore and no indications of rocks
or shoals at that distance from the land
There- is a small shoal about one mile
off shore and seven miles southeast of
Consequina Point. As the Starbuck after
striking ran thirty minutes for the land
at full speed, in which she must have
run three miles and then had seven and
a half fathoms of water, it was evident
that she was well outside of the shoal
In concluding their report the inspectors
said:
"After a careful consideration of the
evidence we are of the opinion that the
steamship Starbuck struck on an un
charted rock, and that Captain Brugiere
was navigating her in a careful manner
and did all that was possible to save the
vessel after she struck."
The inspectors placed the value of the
Starbuck at $ou,ooo. She was a total loss.
Eleven passengers and a crew of fifty
nine were on board and all were saved.
One-half of the 56ft tons of cargo on board
was saved; value unknown.

THE DONAHUE LIBRARY.
Validity of the Trust Clause Estab
lishing It Is in Question.
Argument on the trust clause of the will
of the late Mrs. Annie Donahue, setting
aside the sum of $105,000 to establish a
, library at St. [gnatius College, was heard
by Judge Hunt yesterday morning. A
contest has arisen over the refusal of t lie
college to accept tlie gift. Archbishop
Riordan has made application to the
couri for appointment as trustee of tue
bequest Instead of the trustees of the
j college, the Archbishop claiming- that the
; pift is a public charity and that it should
not lie lost on account of the refusal of
those- named to accept it.
J. 1 1. Harvey, an heir to c portion of Mrs.
; Donahue's estate, tiled an application con
senting to the appointment of Archbishop
Riordan or any other suitable person, but
Mrs. Eleanor Martin and her throe sons-
Peter D.. Walter S. and Andrew Martin
are contesting the application on the
ground that the sift is not a public char
ity but is a private trust for the trustees
of ili<> college, and upon their refusal to
accept it the bequest lapsed. They also
claim that the sum named is inadequate
to found and properly care for the Dona
hue library ami in consequence the trust
is invalid. Other points were also raised
by counsel during the argument.
John Garber appeared tor Mrs. Martin
â  and occupied most of the morning session
ii> opposing the application of Archbishop
Riordan, and was followed by Garret Mc-

Charles A. Wetmore, San Francisro, Cat.â
My ear Sir: I have been designated by the
Secretary of Agriculture to collect and prepare
for an exhibit of the wines of this country at
the Paris Exposition. You â¢will see from the
tnclcsed circular that it will not be possible
to give separate space to any individual ex
hibitor. Since California is the center of all
the vine Industry of this country. I think that
it would lip well to have a collective exhibit
of the California wines made under the auspices
of the Vitlcultural Association or of some other
State organization. Such an exhibit would be
far more representative in character than could
possibly be organized of samples assembled by
Individual dealers.
