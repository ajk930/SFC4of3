VOLUME LXXXVI-NO. TO.
DREYFUS IS BREAKING DOWN
UNDER THE MENTAL STRAIN
General Mercier or Former President Cassimir-Perier to Be Arrested
for Perjury.
0 v . _ .
RENNES, Aug. S.â The police ar- i
rangements in the vicinity of the j
Lycee this morning were exactly
the same as those of yesterday,
but not more than a hundred
persons had gathered at the early
hourâ 6: CO o'clockâ fixed for the open
ing of the day's -dings in the trial
of Captain Dreyfus. The prisoner was i
conducted to the Lycee at 6:15, and ex- j
actly the same precautions were ob- '
served as on yesterday. As soon as
Dreyfus was inside th Lycee, how- j
ever, the police cordons were removed j
and the few spectators were allowed I
to circulate freely in the streets around j
the building.
No demonstration was made upon the
arrival on foot of Main- Laborie or
Maitre De Mange, counsel for Dreyfus,
or the members of the court-martial or
of General < 'hanoim formerly Minister
of War, who attends the court to give
necessary explanations as to the secret
dossier.
General Chamoine appeared in uni
form. He was accompanied by an
officer carrying a leather wallet,
in which were General Chamoine's
notes and other papers referring to the
dossier, which itself remains in a
strong-box in a room contiguous to the
courtroom. This strong-box is guarded
night and day by an officer specially
detailed for this duty.
The secret session lasted until 11:45,
when the court adjourned until to-mor
row morning. The day passed quietly.
There was a much larger crowd than
yesterday assembled in the hope of ob
taining a view of Dreyfus during the
ten seconds occupied by him in crossing
the avenue on his way to the Lycee
â¢from his prison. During the sitting
the crowd, numbering about 2000 per
sons, and composed purely of sight
seers, was allowed to pass, freely be
fore the Lycee until a few moments
before Dreyfus emerged. Then the
chief of the gendarmie made a sign to
his assistant, who blew a whistle. Be
fore the shrill sound had ceased the
Found of hoofs was heard and a strong
guard of mounted gendarmes, a mo
ment later followed by gendarmes on
foot, galloped into the avenue from a
side street and divided into two de
tachments stretching across the ave
nue and cleared a space of "- 11 " yards
in front of the Lycee. The horsemen
rode on the sidewalks, clearing every
body out. Even the newspaper men
were driven away. Then a detachment
of infantry, headed by a bugler,
dashed up at double line and formed
across the avenue from the door of the
Lycee to the postern gate of the Manu
tentlon- The soldiers were stationed
shoulder to shoulder, facing outward
toward the spectators and behind the
mounted gendarmes a hundred yards
off.
Soon afterward somebody shouted, I
"Here he is," and the spectators, many j
of whom had come from neighboring
towns expressly to see Dreyfus, craned
their necks and stood on tiptoe, hoping
to catch a view of the famous prisoner j
as, preceded and followed by gen- ,
darmes and with a captain of gen- :
darmes beside him, he passed through :
the lane of soldiers with a quick mili- j
tary step, eyes front and with soldierly j
bearing, but with the slight, jerky
movement of the left, arm and shoul- |
der of the Continental officer, accus
tomed always to resting his hand on j
the hilt of his sword. Dreyfus, how

his sword. The crowd just perceived j
the prisoner's head and shoulders as he j
passed by the gaps between the heads j
of the infantrymen, whose red kepis,
dark-blue tunics and bright-red, baggy j .
trousers threw a band of color across j.
the roadway. Less than a minute was
occupied in crossing the roadway, and j
immediately after Dreyfus .reached the :
wall of the Manutention, the postern ;
gate' was thrown open and he disap
peared wfthin. j
The shrill whistle was again heard,
then the gendarmes wheeled around j
and galloped back to their barracks,
the crowd quickly dispersed and in a
few minutes the vicinity of the Lycee
was almost deserted.
In the meanwhile Colonel Jouaust
and the other members of the court
martial, Major Carriere, the official
representative of the Government, and
General Chamoine, all in full uniform, j
jas yesterday, left the Lycee. by the j'
main portal, the crowd saluting them I
respectfully. * j
The condition of Dreyfus is disquiet
ing. His wonderful will power alone is,
j lending him strength to go through the j
â¢ present ordeal. Physically he is ex
tremely weak. His stomach re
i fuses all solid food â  and he is able j'
to take ; only milk. His family
is very anxious.
The court-martial "was able this
, morning to consider only part of. the
secret dossier. The documents were
\ submitted to the Judges in the order in
which they were classified. General j
Chamoine gave lucid explanations of J
points which were not clear to* Colonel j
Jouaust. General Chamoine took the I
documents individually and explained
them. Major Carriere will later state
the conclusion he draws from the dos
sier.
Maitres Laborie and Demange, who
listened with close attention to* Gen- '
eral Chamoine's explanations, did not
enter into the discussion of the matter, :
to-day's discussion of the dossier being t
of a general character and more in the
nature of a preliminary examination.
The Temps says Dreyfus was greatly
astonished at the fact that he was
brought into the court a prisoner. He ;
believed, according to this paper, that ;
he was entering into the judicial for- I
malities of an immediate rehabilitation i
and was thanking General de Bois- j
deffre for the revision of his case. He '
said in a firm voice:

ACQUITTAL OF DREYFUS

RENNES, Frence, Aug. B.â Maitre De
mange, the principal counsel for Captain !
Dreyfus, expressed himself as well !_tis- ;
fled with yesterday's proceedings. Colonel j
Jouaust had to play the part of a severe j
judge, but though his voice was rude and j
his manner rough toward the prisoner nis |
eye was kind, and there was no attempt I
to press home the points raised by the in- |
dictment. i
M. Chamoine, the custodian of the
famous secret dossier, said it would take
four days to examine it, as the examina
tion would be behind, closed doors and
most of the witnesses have gone to the
seaside General de Boisdeffre to Dinard
and General Dionne. to Param. General
Mercier remains here," the guest of Gen
eral Saint Germain, who tells his friends
to be prepared for sensational news that
must crush Dreyfus and many others with
him.
M. Cavaignac talked at Le Mars on his
way here. He said he expected two coups j
de theatre. We now hear that one will
be an avowal by General Billot that he j
said on his soul and conscience Dreyfus j
was a traitor because he was misled. The
other will be Mercier driven to bay. The i
latter will issUe from this trial ruined if !
Dreyfus is acquitted. I. hear he intends j
to throw a searchlight on the secret coun- ,
cils of the Dupuy government, of which
he was a member in 1894, and to show
what diplomatic wires were pulled be
tween the arrest of Dreyfus -and his em
barkation for Cayenne. Mercier refuses
to be interviewed. He looks bowed
down from care.
General Billot, on the other hand, seems
to have taken out a new lease of life. He
is also extremely reticent as, indeed, are
all the witnesses of note.
M. Jaures arrived last night, j He claims
to know much that is in the secret dos
sier. An Intercepted correspondence be
tween two military attaches who were
mixed up in the affair is., said by Jaures
to be a shame to human, nature. . These
two officers wrote under feminine names
and in a strain that might not have
shocked the young courtiers of Nero or
the ribald crowd that gathered around
Lot's house in the doomed city. Possibly,
nay, probably, the attaches in question
never wrote these scented anacreontic bil
lets, for such they are. Le Mercier Pick
ard was equal to the task of forging them
and he possibly did forge them for a pc
! cuniary ' consideration. Hence, perhaps,
! the mjstery in which his suicide is
! shrouded.
The counsel for Dreyfus met to-day at
his wife's residence with the heads of the
Dreyfofdte party and consulted on the
present aspect of the affair. They went
there after they had examined the docu
ments of the secret dossier in the Judges"
room. They do not see any- possibility of
repeating the judgment of 1594.
Dreyfus was greatly fatigued after
yesterday's ordeal. lie asked anxiously
to-day what the press and public thought
and was led to think that opinion is gen
erally favorable. This is true. The rep
resentatives of nationalist journals here
who judge harshly in print express ad
miration for the unflinching constancy
he has displayed. Leading personages here
for the trial have much to say about the
late General Annenkoff and Baron Fred
erick in connection with Dreyfus, but
General Mercier and M. Hanotaux, for
mer Minister of Foreign Affairs, refuse
to speak on the subject. M. Hanotaux

Trying' Experience of the
Bessie Stevens En
Route to Guam.
WATER SUPPLY LOST
The Vessel Was So Badly Dam
aged That She Was Obliged to
Put Into Kobe for Repairs.
VICTORIA. B. C. Aug. B.â Copies
of the Kobe Chronicle received
by the Empress of Japan con
tain interviews with Captain
Benjamin Havner and the ship's
company of the schooner Bessie Stev
ens, the vessel recently built at San
.Francisco. They had a most exciting
story to relate of adventures In a storm
encounter* July -4. The Bessie Stevens,
according to the story told by them,
left San Francisco* for Guam with .*-.
party of investigators and provisions
for the traders on the islands.
Guam was reached on June 24 and
instructions were received there to pro
ceed to Hongkong and communicate
with Manila by cable. On July 4. about
the middle of the northeast trades in
longitude 134 degree* 52 minutes east
and latitude 16 degrees 54 minutes
north, the Stevens encountered a severe
hurricane from the southeast, which
lasted for four days. The glass on the
nth fell to 29.40, which was the lowest
' reading recorded.
Captain Havner, who has been four
' teen years at ( sea, says that he has
never experienced a hurricane of such
; force. â¢
The waves ran. he pays, over fifty feet j
,'high. and what was worse, broke. On j
the third day of the gale an enormous
wave struck the schooner amidships
and, the ballast shifting, the vessel was ,
thrown on her beam ends. As good luck 1
would have it. no other wave struck
her while in this position, and before
the next big wave came the sailors |
managed to get some of the ballast
shifted and the boat on an even keel, j
The feelings of Captain Havner may be
better imagined than described when it j
is stated that he had his wife and child I
on board. Of course, a small boat was!
; prepared for use in th** event of the I
I schooner foundering, i3l*_ -'â¢.â â ., i
tain said: "One does that sort of thing ;
out of habit, but it would save time to
go down with the vessel. A small boat
in such a sea could not have lived five
| minutes." â  . . :....,*.
The schooner, as might be expected,
suffered severe damage. She was bad
ly strained and leaking, and after the
storm part of the cabins had to be torn
away to find the leak. The head sail
was also blown away, and the main
topmast and the galley and booby
hatch washed overboard.
To add to the misfortunes of the voy
age, the shifting of the ballast when
the schooner was thrown on her beam
ends caused a water cask to ' urst, and
for some time the crew had to be put
on short allowance.
Captain Havner found it best with
the prevailing winds to put into Kobe
for repairs, * hich will probably take a
considerable time.

five miles beyond San Fernando to-day and encountered and defeated a Filipino force of

nÂ± - The enemy retreated, leaving many dead and wounded. The American loss in killed and
wounded was twenty.
There has been a strong suspicion that for some time past insurgents were among sup
posedly peaceful natives entering Manila.
The Provost Marshal took steps to learn if these suspicions were true, and soon discovered
that rebels had entered the city and were actively plotting to start riots. They were also en
gaged in smuggling arms for the enemy.
At midnight last night men engaged in hunting down the conspirators located their head
quarters in a cigar factory in Binondo. * A company of the Sixth Infantry, under command of Cap
tain Ames, was at once dispatched to the. place, which was surrounded. The soldiers raided the
factory and captured forty-three rebels, including a number of officers belonging to the Filipino
army. There were more men in the building, but they managed to escape by means of the roof
of the factory and adjoining buildings. It is believed the authorities have succeeded in capturing
a powerful gang that was giving valuable service to the enemy.

general, knowing of the conspir
acy, instead of meeting the
wishes of the deputation, gave
orders for their immediate ban
ishment from the city. Notwith
standing their protestations of
good intentions, the rebel sym
pathizers, for such they were,
were forced to gather their
women and children together
and leave the city. General Mac-
Arthur has also, as a measure of
precaution, expelled every native
who does not own property. The
cable connecting Calamba with
Taguig has been cut by the
rebels.
Aguinaldo has appealed to the powers
for recognition of "Filipino independ
ence" in'a document dated from Tarlac,
July 27, and signed by Buencaminho.
It has beer received by all the foreign
Consuls in Manila, with the request
that they forward it to their respective
Governments.
The Filipinos use their old argument
that they had conquered the sover
, eignty of these islands from Spain
before the signing of the treaty of
Paris and therefore Spain was in no
; position to. cede them to the United
States. They argue that the possession
; of the 7000 Spanish prisoners, captured
â  with their arms, fighting against the
Filipinos, is eloquent proof of the nullity
of the Spanish sovereignty, as when
they surrendered Spain's hold was irre
vocably lost. The document then says:
Replying to the Spanish Commission's
request to release the prisoners because
Spain no longer has political interests in
the islands, we asked for a treaty of
. peace and friendship between Spain and
the Filipinos. whereby the prisoners
i would be released. But the commission
ers refused, because it would mean r< c
ofnition of our Independence. This is
i equivalent to saying that the prisoners
I must stay in our hands indefinitely lie
. cause their possession is our most effica-
I cious method to adjust our account with
Spain and obtain from her recognition of
1 independence.
The Filipinos claim that they con
quered all the country except Manila,
and that they co-operated, in securing
the latter'-* capitulation by surround
ing it at the cost of thousands of lives.
They also claim they conquered the
country unassisted, except for sixty
guns that Admiral Dewey gave Agui
naldo, and that Admiral - Dewey and
the British and Belgian Consuls rec
ognized the Filipino sovereignty by
asking for passes to visit the country.
They claim that they have ' letters
from American Consuls and generals
recognizing their sovereignty and
promising that the Americans would
recognize their independence, "which
was at the disposition of the powers."
The Filipinos attempt to make capital
I of the statement that Admiral Dewey
i had such confidence Aguinaldo would
j observe and fulfill the rules of war
that he gave him a hundred Spanish
prisoners which the American navy
had captured.
Finally; the Filipinos appeal to the
powers to influence Washington to
bring a termination to the unjust war
which is devastating the country.

"General Otis is a silly old

CHINA WILL NOT
RECOGNIZE REBELS
Not in a Position to . Set Herself
Against the United
States.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8. The State
Department is entirely without in
formation as to the address by Aguin
aldo to foreign powers tor the recogni
tion of the Filipinos, either as belliger
ents or as constituting an Independent
government. The appeal Is looked
upon, however, as creating no particu
lar change, as it has been the desire
of Aguinaldo and associates from the
lirst to secure such recognition. The
appeal puts this desire Into rather
formal shape, and it may bring to an
Issue the position of outside govern
ments. There is no idea here that any
foreign government- will heed the ad
dress. The international usage as to
recognition was q*ilte fully developed
during the Cuban insurrection, at
which time the question was exhaust
lively discussed in Congress and was
the subject of lengthy consideration in
the messages of the President. The
general view at that time was that
recognition of belligerency was not In
itself a casus belli. Up to the present
time there has been no intimation to
the Stat. Department that any foreign
power entertained even the remotest
Idea of giving recognition to Aguinaldo
and his associates. On the contrary,
there has been most friendly feeling
maintained between this Government
and foreign powers throughout the
Filipino conflict. 1 .
Some time at-., General Otis made
requisition on the War Department for
2500 horses to mount the cavalry in the
Philippines. He stated in the dispatch
that the horses in the islands were not
satisfactory and. that the contracts for
them in China had failed, tin- words
'Contraband of war being added.
The report from General Otis thai
China, had refused to permit the ship
ment to Manila of horses purchased at
Tientsin by his agents was made the
subject of an official representation to
the Peking Government, and late re
ports received from Minister Conger
show that the prohibition was not par
ticularly applied! against the United
States, but against Germany as well,
and that the exportation of mules and
horses is forbidden by law. Neverthe
less Minister Conger satisfied himself
that there is no cause for alarm at the
action of the Chinese Government and
officials are confident from his report
that China will not recognize the Inde
pendence of the Insurgents. Concern
ing the results of his investigation this
statement was made at the State De
partment to-day: "On making Inquiry
at the Department of Stat.- concerning
the report that the Chinese Government
had refused permission "or the expor
tation of horses and mules from China
to the Philippine Islands on the ground
thai they were contraband of war, it is
ascertained that early in June Minister
Conger reported to the Department of
State that the United. states quarter
-1 master at Manila, having purchased
seventy-five ponies and twenty-five
i mules at Tientsin, an export pass was
refused and that upon . application to
the Chinese Tsung-Ll-Yamen, or Coun
cil of State, for permission to export
the animals, Mr. Conger was informed
that such permission would be granted
to the United States Government if it
were possible to grant it to any gov
ernment, but that for a long time the
export of ponies and mules had been
forbidden by law and on several recent
occasions had been refused to other
governments, so that no exception
could be well made .in favor of the
United States.
"Mr. Conger explains that native po
nies are needed for use in the Chinese
army, for which reason their exporta
tion is prohibited, except In small lots
of ponies claimed to be for racing;, polo,
etc. So far as Mr. Conger can ascertain
no large lots have been permitted to be
sent to any of the foreign stations in
China or to any foreign governments
since 1888.
"In a later dispatch Mr. Conger re
ports that while the Taotai at Tientsin
bad permitted the shipment of thirty
mules to Manila a second request for a
shipment of 150 had been refused. Mr.
Conger added that a similar refusal
had been made upon the application of
the German legation to send sixty po
nies to Kiaochau."
The importance of success in the
coming fall campaign is thoroughly ap
preciated by administration officials,
who understand that If the insurgents
should at its close lie as strong as they
are "to-day, the difficulty of preventing
recognition of their belligerency will be
materially increased.
The course which the foreign Consuls
at Manila will pursue in connection
with Aguinaldo's communication Is a
matter of some conjecture among offi
cials here. At the State Department
there is no disposition to limit the Con
suls in forwarding the appeal l 0 their
respective governments. As a rule it is
quite unusual for Consuls holding exe
quaturs from a friendly government
and having official relation with it to
carry on communication with an Insur
rectionary leader, but it is appreciated
that in this case the Consuls are the
innocent victims of Aguinaldo's letter
writing.
As military authority is supreme in
the Philippines any question arising as
to the course of the Consuls would
probably be referred to General Otis,
but there is no Intimation here that he
has been advised of the address or that
he will have any objections to its trans
mission by the Consuls. It is rather ex
pected, however, that the Consuls will
take occasion to advise with the mili
tary authorities as to the proprieties
â of the situation before taking final
action.
That the officers and men of the
Asiatic squadron may be in condition
to heartily assist the army in its fall
operations against Aguinaldo's forces
Acting Secretary Allen has decided to
instruct Rear Admiral Watson to dis
patch his vessels in rotation to Yoko
hama. Japan. The vessels will remain
a month each in Japanese waters, and
any of the men who may be debilitated
will be left in the naval hospital at Yo
kohama until they are entirely recov
ered and lit to resume duty. The deci
sion of Mr. Allen In this matter was the
result of a conference he had with Sur
geon General Van Reypen. The deci
sion of Mr. Allen is not due, I was told.
to any fear of disease among the crews
of vessels, but to a desire to keep the
men in good condition.

STOCKTON, Aug. 8.- A party of sur-
veyors under Civil Engineer H. T.
Compton will in a lew days commence
running preliminary lines between here
and Sacramento for a railroad. It is
believed the work is preliminary to a
j complete survey for persons who have
| an understanding with the Santa Fe
i Company, A number of local capital
j ists are interested in the project. As
i soon as enough data can be obtained
| a detailed report will be forwarded to
| the railroad men, and if satisfactory
it is expected encouragement will be
i given to local capitalists to begin the
work of ruction.
Compton acknowledges that the lines
are for a railroad, but declines to dis
cuss the matter further. It is consid
ered probable thai one object of the
survey Is to ascertain what encourage
ment could be obtained from residents
along the route in the matter of rights
of way.
It is proposed to make the line as
nearly straight as possible. The first
survey will begin west of the lower
Sacramento road and continue due
north to New Hope. It is believed here
that the people of the valley will wel
come an extension of the Santa Ft and
give all reasonable encouragement to
the company's plans.
I Secretary referred to his visit to Platts-
I burg barracks this afternoon,' where he
I witnessed a regimental drill of the Twen-
I ty-sixth Regiment; under commnad of
I Colonel Rice. This regiment has been re
â  cruited and organized in a little over four
weeks and the men drilled like old vet
i erans.
i "The progress which the officers and
; men of the Twenty-sixth Regiment have
made In drilling in so short a time is
I simply marvelous." said Mr. Root, "It
I shows the wonderful power of the United
State** when ten regiments of volunteer
soldiers can be recruited, organized,
drilled and equipped for. active service In
â  the field In so short vi time."
"Will the war in the Philippine be
prosecuted vigorously from now on?"
j asked the correspondent. Mr. Root turned

war in the Philippines from now on will
be prosecuted with all possible energy.
The men, all the arms and all the sup
plies ntcessary to end the trouble in the
islands will be furnished at the earliest
possible moment."
"How large a force will be at the dis
posal of the commanding general there?"
was asked. "There will be 50,000 men
there itody for active service at the close
of the rainy season, about the last of
October, and more will be sent if neces
sary."
As to the rumor published In some of
the papers that President McKinley and
he were not agreeable upon the policy
to be pursued In the Philippinees Mr. Root
said: "Ol course that is all nonsense."
When asked whether General Otis would
be relieved of the command of the Ameri
can forces in the Philippines Mr. Root re
plied that he had nothing to say on that
point at this time.
it would be impossible for any one to
be more emphatic or determined than Sec

whether he and Mercier contradict each
other. . â¢ ..-
There seems danger that all evidence
j relating to foreign diplomatists will be
; jfiven with closed doors. The public trial
'â â  will be resumed on Saturday.
Dreyfus, a member of his family tells
me, has not yet got over his Rip Van
Winkle feeling. He was lost, as he put
it. He remarked to his wife that he was
'' astonished to find himself watched by
the whole world or its proxies, though
jhe showed no sign of astonishment. He
| was thrown in a heap by the searching
and, as he thought, unfriendly examina
i tion by the president of the court-mar
| tial. He had expected more formal pro
i ceedings.
MM. Demange and Laborie did not pre
pare him for a hostile tribunal and a scru
-1 tinizing public. He felt as if X-rays were
being cast on him all the time he was
under public gaze. It was as if the inner
most thoughts of his heart were being
peered into. He imagined the proceedings
would be only formal and that perhaps he
might leave the courthouse to walk to his
wife's temporary home. His counsel was
quite right not to discourage him before
' hand, as his strength Is low and he Is
condemned to a diet of milk and eggs,
which does not enable him rapidly to re
cover his lost strength. A full diet just
now could not fail to bring on Bright's
j disease.
He was at first greatly depressed to
i learn that he would be confronted with
a crowd of hostile witnesses and that the
j trial might last a fortnight or three
i weeks, or even longer. Then, steeling
' himself, he cried:
"You must prove yourself a mau, Drey
fus. You must struggle for your honor
and not give in until you have cleared It,
' once and forever. Rut what have you
done, Dreyfus, to make people to thus
! rend you? Were you born under a malig
nant star? If so, light against fate and
: wrestle until you have thrown the evil
angel."
Prom long habit he speaks to himself

WICKERSHAM WILL
CONTEST STOPPED
A Settlement Made Out
of Court.
FRANK WILL GET A SHARE
HE HAD BEEN CUT OFF WITH
FIVE DOLLARS.
In the Suit the Claim Was Made That
the Father Had Been Unduly
Influenced by His Younger
Son, Fred. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. â . â¢
SANTA ROSA, Aug. B.â The cele
brated Wickersham will contest, of
which so much was expected in the
way of sensational details when the
matter came to trial, has been settled
amicably out of court. By the terms
of the agreement entered Into to-day
Frank Wickersham; the . well-known
Fresno capitalist, is to receive an equit
able share in the estate. left by his
father, the late I. G. Wickersham of
Petaluma, and the contest proceedings
are to be withdrawn at once.
I. G. Wickersham, the well-known
Petaluma banker who died some six
weeks ago, left an estate valued at con
siderably over a million dollars. Sur
viving him were four children, Frank
Wickersham of Fresno, Mrs. Bergeven
of Chicago and Fred a Wickersham and
Miss Lizzie Wickersham oosf s Petaluma.
Each was left an equal portion of the
estate by the terms of the will with the
exception of Frank,' who was cut off
with the proverbial penny, amounting
in this case to $5 in gold.
As a reason for his action in thus dis
inheriting his eldest son the old banker
explained that he had already advanced
him considerable over $100,000 in cash,
and this was all to which he was en
titled. The day after the will was
filed for probate the disinherited son
began contest proceedings to have the
will set aside upon the ground that his
father had been unduly influenced by
his brother Fred Wickersham of Peta
luma. The case attracted widespread
interest both on account of the alle
gations made and the prominence of
the parties concerned.
News that the matter had been sat
isfactorily adjusted reached here late
this evening and Fred A. Wickersham
was at once seen in regard to the mat
ter. ' He substantiated the report and
stated that he and his brother had met
to-day in the office of R. Porter Ashe,
the San Francisco attorney, where all
details of the settlement had been ad
justed to the mutual satisfaction of all
concerned.
In discussing the matter he said that
as soon as the contest proceedings were
begun negotiations looking to a settle
ment had been opened. A number of
propositions had been made back and
forth, none of which proved satisfac
tory. At the meeting held this after
noon Fred A. Wickersham, upon behalf
of himself and the other heirs, made
his final offer, which being deemed
equitable was at once agreed to. A
payment upon account was at once
made anjl a receipt taken therefor, and
as soon as the necessary papers cover
ing the agreement can be drawn up the
contest proceedings now pending in the
courts of this â¢ county will be with
drawn.
Mr. Wickersham declined to state
the terms of the agreement entered in
to, but it is understood that the con
testant receives approximately his full
, share of the estate less the amount he
; has already received from time to time
I and which he has never denied having
I been paid by his deceased father. With
I the signing of the, receipt mentioned in
j Porter Ashe's office to-day the entire
I case was brought to a close and har
| mony once more restored to the "Wick-
I ersham household.

Wreck of the- Los Angeles Express at Dos
Palos Cost the Lives of Two Men,
.ENGINES* JOf]N C FOT*D â
FRESNO, Aug. S.â Picture in your
mind's eye a long string of cars
snapped, as It were, like a black
snake cracked by some mighty
power and lying curled along the
railroad reservation, on either side of
which are stretches of wheat fields just
being tinted by the sun rising over the
mountains: imagine everything twisted
and splintered and wrought out of shape;
Bee a crowd of curious countryfolkâ men
in harvest dress and women and chil
dren in calicoâ and with them glum and
scarred railroad men, and you have a
rough sketch of the scene of the wreck
of the Los Angeles express, which, as "as
reported in this morning's Call, occurred
a half mile this side of Do's Pah).- last
night. Such was the scene when at 6
o'clock this morning Coroner Long and
The Call correspondent arrived on a spe
cial engine at the place of the disaster.
A picture sadder by far was that seen
in the baggage-room at Dos Palos. There
lay two mute and mutilated men â En
gineer Ford and Fireman Woodsâ who
had lost their lives. The bodies jay on
trucks, covered by large blankets. The
men had been scalded so badly that In
many places the flesh had dropped, ex
posing the bones. Friends had bandaged
the burns while the men were still alive
and the bandages were allowed to re
main and held the flesh in place. The
clothes of the men were drenched, not
with water, but with the scalding steam
that burned them.
After Coroner Long had summoned a
Jury the first thing was to view the re
mains. In searching the body of the en
gineer the Coroner took from the vsst
pocket his watch, which v. as running and
â¢â hewed the correct time.
Immediately after the wreck a special
train was made up at Tracy and sent to
the scene of the disaster. It had arrived
before the Coroner, and hence the state
ments of the passengers could not be ob
tained there by him. for the passenge-s
were taken back to Tracy and thence sent
over the main route down the valley. A.
rumber of the Fresno passengers reached
here at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon. This
special train hud attached to it three of
the Pullman coaches of the wrecked train
â the last three, which had not been de
railed.
The first Intimation of anything being
wrong came to the railroad men shortly
after leaving Dos Palos. when the train
began to get "wobbly.'' Conductor Harry
W Bridges says he was in the first sleep
er and he felt the train jarring. He im
mediately concluded that It was off the
track and rung the whistle to warn the
engineer. The latter applied the airbrake
end made what is called an emergency
<=top. The train was going at the rate of
thirty-five miles an hour. Before the con
ductor could pull the string again the air
brakes had been applied and in an Instant
the cars had been hurled off the track
in all directions. Only the last four Pull
mans held the rails.
The engine was hurled In the ditch.
DOUBLE TRAGEDY
AT NEVADA CITY
Charles Moreno Kills a
Woman.Then Himself.
Sp**-**!*"" Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEVADA CITY, Aug. B.â Charles
Moreno, a half-breed Spaniard aged 25
years, and a young and attractive
woman of the half-world known both as
Clara Wallace and Mrs. Lizzie Riley
are to-night lying dead at the Rocky
Bar House, a place of bad repute in
the outskirts of the little mining town
of Washington, in this county.
Shortly after 9 o'clock this morning
Moreno killed her and then took his
own life. He had long been infatuated
with the woman, and according to a note
that he left for the Coroner had a year
ago left his own wife to bask in her
smiles. Last spring the woman had de
serted him at 18 Turk street, San Fran
cisco, where they were living together,
and had come to this county. He could
not live without her, he declared, and
as she refused to return â¢ to him he
thought it better that both of them
wind up their troublous career here to
be happily reunited in another world.
Moreno arrived in this city on last
evening's train, and armed with a re
volver and a murderous dirk started
on foot for Washington, nineteen miles
above here. Upon his arrival there he
went to the house where the object of
his mad infatuation lived With Mollie
Walsh, keeping a den of the vilest de
scription.
His unexpected appearance crease
consternation on the part of the woman
he sought. He demanded that she at
once leave with him. She refused and
a violent quarrel ensued. She stood her
ground and ordered him to leave. With
out warning he fired two shots. Both
entered her breast, one piercing her
heart. Her body plunged headlong
from the door in which she stood to
the ground.
Then Moreno wrote the note that the
Coroner found, and having signed it
stood near her corpse and fired at his
own breast, the bullet striking a bone
and making only a slight wound. Next
he put the muzzle of the weapon to his
head, and sending a ball Into his brain
sank lifeless by his victim's side. The
Coroner's jury returned a verdict in
accordance with these facts. The Riley
woman was at one . time a resident of
Marysville.

indescribable agony until he was extri
cated by Conductor Bridges and others
who had" run to the assistance of the un
forunate man. He was carried in a
stretcher and placed in one of the day

The fireman was frenzied with his
agony. He rushed from the track and
dashed through the reservation fence,
forcing his way through two rows of
barbed wire, and started to run like mad
in the open wheat field. Trainmen and
passengers caught him. tore his scalded
overalls and jumper from his body and
his gloves from his hands and placing him
on a stretcher conveyed him to one of the
sleepers.
There happened to be two trained nurses
on the train, one of whom was Mrs.
Kauffman. and they did everything pos
sible to relieve the sufferings of the en
gineer and fireman. Woods was conscious
to the last. Despite his excruciating pain,
he could not thank the kind women
enough. He talked continually about his
wife and boy. He said he hated to leave
them no better provided for.
Medical attendance was slow in reaching
the scene of the disaster. Dr. Wade from
Dos Banns Dr. Homestead from Newman

men did not remember finally arrived.
They were unable to do anything for the

ARGENTINE PRESIDENT
RECEIVED IN BRAZIL
Assurances Are Given That No Ac-
tion Unfavorable to the United
States Will Be Taken.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. B.â The Ar
gentine squadron, escorting President
Roca of the Argentine Republic, has
arrived here. F.etes lasting nine days
have been arranged in honor of Presi
dent Roca.
A Brazilian squadron went out to re
ceive the Argentine warships. The
President of Brazil, Dr. Ferra_ de
Campos Salles, on board the Rio
Chuelo, Inside the bay, received Presi
dent Roca and his suite in the presence
of the members of the Brazilian Cabi
net and a number of Brazilian generals
and Senators.
President Roca was then taken
ashore in a magnificent barge and
lodged in the presidential palace.
As to the political objects of the
visit, the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press was assured to-day by a
high authority that if an attempt were
contemplated to ally the Latin-Ameri
cans against the United States it was
bound to prove a failure, for Brazil
will do nothing to offend America, her
best customer for her principal prod
ucts.
It is even doubtful, according to the
same authority, whether Argentina
will obtain a commercial treaty in
detriment to United States wheat and
flour, as Argentina already sells twice
what she buys from Brazil.
The chief advantage to be derived
from the visit of the Argentine Presi
dent is a harmonious understanding
aiming at a reduction of the military
expenses of the South American re
publics.
POOLROOM MEN WIN.
Petition for Disincorporation of

SAUSALITO. Aug. B.â A petition for the
disincorporation of the town, the ultlm-.te
result of which would have been the
death of the poolrooms, was thrown oÂ«t
by the Trustees at a special meeting neld
last evening. The petition was signed by
190 persons, but forty-two names were
withdrawn from it. Among them were J.

had been obtained by fraud and misrepre
sentation, and John Shane, Dr. May and
H. W. Howell, who claimed to have been
victims of misrepresentation.
A certified statement from County Clerk
Robert Graham showed that Nathaniel
Nau, whose name had been twice used,
was dead, and that the names of twenty
seven other signers were not on the great
register. As the taking away of seventy
names rendered the petition without ef
fect It was thrown out, much to the dis

The most remarkable thing about the

A piece of broken bolt resembling a

Third Bereavement of His Family
Within Seven Months.
BERKELEY. Aug. B.â Porter G. Woods,
the fireman who met death early this

The Opinion of Embas
sador Choate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aug. B.â Joseph H. Choate,
| the United States Embassador to Great
Britain, was interviewed to-day by a rep
; resentative of the United State 3in re
â  gard to the recent "war or arbitration"
i speech delivered by Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
I the Canadian Premier. He said: "There
j will be no war. It is safe to say that no
amount of political talk by politicians in
other countries could occasion war in this
connection."
The Embassador, continuing, said that
! the Canadian Parliament was on the eve
| of dissolution and the leaders of both par
] ties had to speak. Mr. Choate seemed to
j think that the latter circumstance cx
i plained Sir Wilfrid Laurier's position and
he was inclined to attach small impor
| tance to the Premier's remarks. Mr.
I Choate added that the negotiations were
i progressing, "But," he explained, "they
' are always slow and I can say nothing
at present as to their status."
Regarding Mr. Choate's statement the
! Canadian High Commissioner, Lord
Strathcona and Mount Royal, said to a
I representative of the Associated Press:
"Sir Wilfrid Laurier's remant was
! merely a figure of speech and not a po
litical dodge, as Intimated by Mr. Choate.
: Sir Wilfrid Laurier would not descend to
such a thing, nor did he in any way mean
!to challenge the United States. No sen
i sible man could regard war as possible,
1 but Canada is simply taking a leaf out
of the United States' book ln demanding
now what the United States demanded
In the Venezuelan case. Canada Is now
a nation, though closely allied to Great
Britain. As such she must protect her
rights. We merely ask for an equitable
settlement through arbitration, following
the United States' lead. We jelieve
President McKinley ls thoroughly in
earnest in his endeavor to have the Ques
tion honestly settled. The misinterpre
tation of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's remarks
by the United States Is unfortunate. Any
bitterness or abuse by the Canadian press

I tions are progressing and I believe a sat-

MEXICO TO
BLAME FOR
YAQUI WAR
Treacherous Treatment of
the Indians by General
Carbo.
OLD FEUD AWAKENS
Extermination of the Tribe Means
Disaster to the State of
Sonora.
By GUSTAV EISEN.
The seriousness of the Taqul war in
Sonora cannot possibly be overestimat
ed. The question at issue is not merely
if the. Yaquis are to be conquered or
not, but the whole welfare of the coun
try is at stake. If the war is continued
until the Yaquis are pacified or exter
minated dire disaster is sure to befall
that beautiful State. The extermina
tion of the Yaqui Indians simply means
the destruction of the manual labor In
Sonora. The Yaquis are not only the
best and most trusted workers In So 5
nora, but they constitute the largest
number of able worklngmen in that
State.
The Yaquis can In no way be com
pared with the Indians of this coast,
nor with any other Indians in the
United States, except, perhaps, the
Cherokees and a few other tribes
known for their peacefulness and for
their love of application to agriculture.
Since the very first settlement of So
nora by the Spaniards the Yaquis have
inhabited a small triangular territory
situated in the delta of the Y'aqui River
and extending from the Gulf to a place
inland called Buena Vista. A few Ya
quis are settled as far up as Comurifa,
but the principal Y'aqui country is as
just stated further down the coast. In
this territory the Y'aquis were found by
the Spaniards, and their tradition is
that here they have resided from im
memorial times. For centuries the
Mexican Government acknowledged
the right of the Y'aquis to live in and to
cultivate this territory and for centu
ries the Yaquis remained peacefully at
their work of cultivating the soil and
as general laborers elsewhere. Within
their territory the Y'aquis have even
now retained an independent govern
ment, with chiefs to decide according
to their laws and to mete out punish
ment to the guilty, and so perfect has
been their method of self-government
that the Mexican Government has had
no occasion to interfere. The Yaqui is
by nature moral and industrious and
no complaint can be made against him
on that account. All over Sonora there
are found Y'aquis in time of peace
working in the fields and in the mines
and even as laborers on the railroads.
In the latter capacity they are more
valued and more trusted than any
Mexicans, and we know of instances
where railroad agents have preferred
Y'aqui section bosses to those of other
nationalities.
As a laborer the Yaqui ia hard-work
ing and faithful and can always be re
lied on. He does not shirk his work
when his foreman turns his back and
he does not shorten his day's work by
continued cigarette smoking. No won
der, therefore, that he is highly valued
for the work he can and does perform.
As do many other laborers, he gets
drunk when pay comes on Saturday
evening, but he confines his carousing
to the rancheria in which he lives and
keeps his family and when Monday
morning comes around every man is at
his work.
The Yaqui country from Buena Vista
to the gulf has always been held as
common property by the Yaquis as a
tribe and has never been portioned out
to Individuals as in other communities.
The reason for this is found in the na
ture of the territory itself. The fer
tility of the Yaqui delta depends en
tirely upon the overflow of the Yaqui
River. In times of heavy rains the
delta and adjacent river bottom lands
are covered by water or made moist
by subirrlgatlon, while in dry seasons
the contrary is the case. As the ter
ritory is large, each Individual Yaqui
can always find a place suitable for
cultivation for that particular season.
Next season he may have to move to
another place in order to find moisture
and other conditions necessary. Now
it is evident that if the land were not
held in common and if every Yaqui had
his own allotted piece some would pos
sess suitable land for cultivation while
others would have dry lands, which
would be worthless unless properly ir
rigated.
All the recent trouble with the Yaquis
arises from this fact. The Mexican
Government wants the Y'aquis to divide
their land so that every Individual may
possess his own plat. This the Yaquis
refuse to do. The trouble originated
some years ago when under the presi
dency of Juarez the Mexican Govern
ment passed a law that there should
be no more public lands in the repub
lic, but that all lands so held should
be surveyed and sold. The same law
required every individual community
which possessed a "common" to have
the same surveyed at its own expense
and to have it divided and portioned
off, if not sold in a body for the good
of the community by which the "com
mon" was held. Thus in 1863 the town
of Hermosillo, now the capital of So
nora, had to survey its common and
dispose of it.
That this law was a most unjust and
illegal one no one can very well deny.
Suppose the United States Government
should pass a law that San Francisco
should divide up its Golden Gate Park
and its Yosemite reservation and give
every man a piece in order that he
might better and more undisturbed en
joy his share. What would be said of
such a law and how would Americans
stand such oppression? They would un
doubtedly object and the chances are
that they would forcibly resist any in
terference with their personal and pub
lic rights.
That is exactly what the Yaquis have
done. Indeed, so vested were the Yaquis
in the possession of their land that the
Mexican Government hesitated to ap
ply the law to their territory, but al
lowed them at least for the time being
to possess their land undisturbed.
While all other public lands in Mexico
were surveyed and distributed, the
Y'aqui country had remained intact for
about twenty years when the first
Y'aqui war broke out.
The outbreak of the war, which ex
terminated one-third of the Yaquis,
was, strange to say. not brought about
by the Mexican Government, but by
one of its generals in order to further
his own selfish ends. At that time
General Jose Guillermo Carbo was
commander of the federal forces in So
nora. Having illegally spent mony in
trusted to him for paying his troops,
he conceived the idea not only to
cover his peculations but also to bring
about a war in order to gain all he
could. In time of peace ever." general

then partly living on their reservation
partly distributed over Sonora, zona
and even New Mexico as workers in
the fleld and in the mines. At that
time the Yaquis were governed by a
chief called Cajemi, an honest and
skillful man, generally esteemed and
against whom no one had ever had
! any complaints. General Carbo found
i as a pretext that Cajemi had not ful
filled the Mexican law regarding the
partition of the land and brought
against him other trumped-up charges
Without any right whatever Carbo

Yaquis, one who was an outlaw- .and

could oust Cajemi and bring about as

enticed into a palaver with Carbo, who
offered him safe conduct. Hardly had
, Cajemi shown himself before he was
captured and shot and some of his
principal men were slain with him.
This, of course, did not stop the war.
Other chiefs took up the strife, only to
' pay with their life for their foolhardi
ness. And so the war dragged on. It
: cost the Mexican Government millions
and millions of dollars and thousands
iof men. How many soldiers were killed
in the last war no one knows or ever
will know with any certainty, but a low
estimate gives the number as 1500 sol
â  diers laid low by Yaqui bullets every
year For fourteen years this would
'< mean over 20,000 men. The Mexican
Government was obliged to keep a
â  standing army at San Marcial of N be
tween three thousand and four thou
: sand men, and comparatively few of
these ever returned to the State from
', which' they came.
On the other hand the _aquis num
bered at the beginning of the war about
thirty thousand men. When in 189.
peace was made there remained only
ten thousand Yaquis.
The tactics of the Yaquis are to attack
suddenly and to ambush and Immedi
â  ately after the assault to run back into
the mountains, where no one can fol
low them. After a Yaqui has fought for
some time he suddenly becomes a
peaceful Indian and leaves the terri
tory In which the war rages. This hap
' pens when his ammunition is all spent:
he must then provide himself with
more. This he does by working In Ari
zona and New Mexico, as in these
places he can procure arms with his
savings and return when he has
enough. When he has accumulated
enough he returns by passing from
i Arizona through the Sierra Madre
wilderness, where he is free from sol
diers' bullets and from observing eyes,
i and when least expected he turns up
fully equipped with munitions to carry
OI The Yaqui is not the bloodthirsty
! beast that some reports have made him
; out to be. He is brave, industrious and
i peaceful; he does not torture his pris
-1 oner-* but neither does he allow them to
1 escape The Yaqui looks upon the na
i tive Sonoran as his friend and brother,
! and both Sonorans and Americans are
rarely the subject of his attack. But
the Mexican soldier, who is always
drafted from some distant state, is al
ways the especial object of his hatred
and considered as his mortal enemy
In 1897 peace was made with the
< Yaquis The Government promised
them a certain sum of money and they
in turn agreed to have their land sur
veyed and partitioned. During the
last two years the Yaquis have quietly
been working in the mines of Sonora
and Arizona and have saved their earn
ings in order to procure arms to renew
the war. Whatever will be the out
i come of the war, it will be a most ruin
i ous one for Sonora. If the Yaquis are
I exterminated, as the reports tell us
i Is the intention of General Torres, then
' the effect will soon be felt. It will mean
I the extermination of the manual labor
> in Sonora; it will mean the crippling
-. of her wheat and mining Industries.
'â  The Mexican Government could well
have afforded to allow the Yaquis to
' remain in possession of their land, as
their value as laborers ls many, many
time" greater than the price that can
be realized by selling their land. Sonora
i is a country with Immense resources,
I with enormous tracts of fertile soil
| where almost anything might be grown
i profitably. Such crops as wheat, sugar-
I cane beans, corn, oranges. dates,
peaches, apricots and many other fruits
are hardly surpassed anywhere. What
â  Sonora requires is not the Yaqui terri
' tory, but a development of its own Irri
! gation facilities.
The present Governor of Sonora Is
one of the most farseeing and enlight
ened and peaceful men ln Sonora, and
it is a great pity that the settlement of
the Yaqui trouble could not have been
â¢ left with the civil authorities instead
'of with the War Department. Sonora
can well afford to dispense with the
! Yaqui country, but It cannot afford to
j kill off the Yaquis.
MAYOS MAY JOIN
IN THE YAQUI WAR
â 
i Young Braves Are Dancing and a
Rising of the Tribe's Fighting
Men Is Feared.
AUSTIN, Tex., Aug. B. A dispatch
from Chihuahua. Mex., states that much
uneasiness is felt in military circles
there over the attitude of . the Mayo
I tribe of Indians in the State of Sonora j
I toward the Mexican authorities in the ;
| present uprising of the Yaqui braves.
' The fighting force of the Mayo triba Is
! much better than that of the Yaquis.
i and they have in the past for many
years been at peace with the Govern
ment. But the younger braves of -he j
tribe are now aroused over the war- j
fare' that is being waged just to the |
west of them and an open revolt is j
threatened. Dancing has been going j
on among the Mayos for the past three
| weeks and a rising may occur at any
moment.
The Mayos have long been friends of
the Yaquis, but they have held aloof
from them In' their previous wars
with the Government, which waged a
long and relentless war against them.
When the treaty of peace was finally
signed their numbers had been de
creased to a few* thousand.
The Mayos are almost white and are
of a higher order of intelligence than
the Yaquis. It is said the Yaquis sent
missionaries among the Mayos several
months ago to agitate a united and
concerted revolt against the Govern
ment. The ilayo chiefs refused to
sanction the uprising, but many of the
younger braves have caught the ex
citement and it is expected they will
be with the Yaquis in a body unless
their present plans are foiled by the
large force of Mexican troops in that
section.
Some of the members of the Mayo
tribe are wealthy. Their reservation
embraces many thousands of acres of
rich land in the valley of the Mayo
River.
INDIANS AND MEXICAN
TROOPS IN BATTLE
Government Soldiers Put to Death
All the Yaquis Taken
Captive.
GUAYMAS. Mexico, Aug. B.â The en
gagement between the forces of General j
Lorenzo Torres and the Y'aquis was not
fought at Vlcam, as reported, but at Tuna ,
j Blanca, In the vicinity of Bacum, which ;
| place is held by the Indians in large num- :
bers. General Lorenzo Torres in person |
led the attack on the position held by the
rebels and was one of the flrst to fall. It !
ls feared he Is badly wounded. The rebels
finally broke and fled, leaving behind sev- :
eral dead and wounded. All the prisoners .
taken were shot.
Lieutenant Herrera, with a small col- i
umn, pave pursuit for a short distance I
and succeeded in killing five more of the j
: enemy, aarkness preventing further op
i erations. The rebels retreated to Bacum, j
' where they are strongly Intrenched.
In the vicinity of Vicum Colonel Anas
i tarlo Torres had a skirmish with small
i detachments of the Indians and killed ,
three.
It is reported that the nationals under :
the command of Captains Celso Vizcaino
' and Antonio Temblador had an encounter !
with the Yaquis and were victorious. The j
losses are unknown
The shipping at Medano is again threat
ened and it is feared that unless rein- i
forcements are sent at once the town and :
I the shipping will fall into the hands of ;
the Yaquis.
At Potem great activity continues and j
: the Federal troops are being concentrated '
i in large numbers. General Luis E. Torres j
i has assumed command of all the forces >
I and will lead the assault on Vicum.
The fortifications in and about Vicum i
are thought to be formidable and it is
: doubtful whether the present available j
forces can successfully cope with the
Y'aquis intrenched there. The result is j
awaited with anxiety by the refugees,
! who look to the troops for protection.
TWO THOUSAND REDS
ENTRAPPED AT BICAM
General Torres Will Bombard the j
Yaquis When His Artillery
Arrives.
CHICAGO, Aug. B.â A special to the
Record from Guaymas, Mex., says:
General Torres has almost complete
ly surrouunded Bicam, a Yaqui strong
hold, where nearly 2000 savages are
j massed. On the arrival of the artillery
and the machine guns the Mexican gen
; eral will close In on the Indians and
; precipitate the biggest battle ever
fought between the Government and
the Yaquis.
The reports from General Torres re
garding the killing of Remley and Mil
ler say their bodies were found hang
ing from a tree with the hands and
feet cut off. The uprising reaches down
the Yaqui River to the sea, and It is
not expected to extend further north
than the Sahuaripa district.
The Government now has nearly 5000
men In the field. Two hundred volun
teers will leave Guaymas for Medano
to-night on the steamer Jalisco.
A fight is expected, on entering the
Yaqui River, with a large band of sav
ages that last week attacked and
burned three sloops, A. Elres, a well
known Mexican at Hermosillo, losing
his life in the encounter.
Business at Guaymas and other
paints in Southern Sonora is practically
at a standstill in consequence of the
rebellion. It has not entirely suspend
ed the heavy freighting done with the
Yaqui Valley, but has led many Mexi
cans of the city to retreat beyond the
prefect's call for volunteers.
The man-of-war Democrata arrived
last night from Ensenada, Lower Cali
fornia, with the remainder of the Sev
; enth Regiment. The Democrata and
' the transport Oaxaca left to-day for
i San Bias "to meet the Sixteenth Regi-
I ment, which is en route from the City
of Mexico.
RECOMMENDS A GOLD
STANDARD FOR INDIA
Lord George Hamilton Says It Is the
Only Financial Safeguard of
the Country.
LONDON, Aug. B.â ln the House of
Commons to-day the Secretary of
State for India, Lord George Hamil
ton, in introducing the Indian budget,
said that after careful consideration
the Government has deliberately con
cluded that a gold standard was re
quired in the interests of India and
that they should not be deterred from
prosecuting this policy by all means ln
their power merely because the next
phase In the advancement was coinci
dent with abnormal or temporary fail
ure of the recommendation.
"If," continued the Secretary, "we
.could establish a great bank like the
Banks of England and France, it would
be*a fruitful ally in establishing a gold
standard."
Continuing, Lord George Hamilton
said he hoped the new century would
be associated with a series of financial
surpluses in India available for the re
duction of taxes, an Industrial develop
ment which would combine to give In
dia the fullest value of its association
with the cheapest, largest and most
fructifying market in the world.
The surplus, he said in conclusion,
this year will be 44,000,000 rupees.

PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, Aug. B.â
Word comes from Monte Christi that Do
minican troops have been hurried there.
The Haytien Government is prepared to
prevent Jiminez from landing on Hay
tlan teritory. All is quiet in Port au
Prince. Suspects are being interrogated
by the authorities.
HAVANA* Aug. S.â General Jun Isidro
Jiminez. the aspirant to the presidency
of the republic of San Domingo, says that
several Dominican generals have already
declared In his favor, in spite of his ad
vice to them to delay definite action. He
denies that the Dominican Government
has 3700 troops under arms, and asserts
that the present executive will not be able
to make an effective resistance, owing to
the scarcity of resources and sympa
thizers.
WASHINGTON. Aug. B.â From the
character of the instructions sent to Gen
eral Brooke to-day it is evident that the
President and Secretary Root have been
giving serious consideration to the threat
ened San Domingo revolution.
It is probable, too. that this subject,
more than any other, is the immediate
cause of Secretary Root's visit to Lake
Champlain. Mr. Root received a sum
mons from the President just after sev
eral dispatches from General Brooke
about the suspicious movements of
Jiminez had been received at Lake Cham
plain. I am told that General Brooke
fears, from the operations of Jiminez.
that he is really planning for an e
tensive filibustering expedition from
Cuba. His frequent conferences with
other exiles from San Domingo have led
to this suspicion, and General Brooke
wired the department for instructions.
They were sent him to-day by direction
of the President, and they are to the ef
fect that he must prevent such an expe
dition at all hazards. ' ___...
According to the views of officials here
âand it is evident that President Mc-
Kinley and Secretary Root are of the
same "opinionâ the United States is just as
much obligated to prevent violation of
neutrality laws in Cuba as in the united
States. Although not American territory.
It is temporarily under the control of the
military forces of this country, and we
are responsible to the other nations of
the world to prevent any infraction of
international law by any one while in Cu
ban soil. _*"â "_â '"'â --.
The Charge d* Affaires of the Dominican
republic in this country has already
called the attention of the authorities to
the contemplated expedition of Jiminez,
and he has been given assurances that
everything possible will be done to pre
vent any Violation of the neutrality laws.
HELD THE WHISKY
WITH A LOADED GUN
SAUSALITO. Aug. B.â An angry man
and a rifle formed a combination at
Mason's distillery, situated about a mile
north of town, which held a United States
Deputy Internal Revenue Collector and
two companions at bay and resulted yes
terday in a warrant being issued tor the
arrest of the belligerent distillery man.
It seems that P. Zimmerman, a whole
sale liquor dealer engaged in business on
Eighteenth and Shotwell streets, San
Francisco, purchased a quantity of liquor
from John Mason Jr., the proprietor of
the distillery, and the Government ware
house, and went there to take away the
liquor in company with W. F. Price, a
Deputy United States Internal Revenue
Collector, and George Raubinger. Price
released the whisky and Raubinger
started forward with the Intention of
loading it on a wagon. Previous to this
Zimmerman and Mason had a dispute
over their bargain, and, failing to come
to an amicable agreement, Mason warned
Raubinger not to touch the whisky. The
caution was disregarded, whereupon
Mason ran to his house for a rifle and.
returning just as Raubinger was in the
act of placing a barrel in his wagon,
pointed a gun at him and threatened to
kill him if he did not drop it. Raubinger
dropped the barrel and ran behind the
wagon, while Price and Zimmerman
scurried to a place of safety.
Raubinger came to town and swore to
a warrant for Mason's arrest en the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Recorder Simpson Issued the wan ant,
which was served by Constable Garnty.

QUEEN OF ALL
SAILING CRAFT
Splendid Race Off
Long Island.
NEW YACHT FAR IN FRONT
LOSES ALL COMPETITORS BUT
THE DEFENDER.
Result of New York Yacht Club's
First Run Indicates That the
Shamrock Will Be Beaten
by the American.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GREENPORT, L T.. Aug. B.â The first
run of the New York Yacht Club to-day
from Now London out Into the sound as
far a? Watch Hill and back to Gardlners
Bay was one of the most successful in the
club's history. Not only was the day an
Ideal one. with a great whole-sail breeze
from the west, which held through from
start to finish, but the club watched with
pride the magnificent run <".' the new
queen of the fleet, the Columbia, which
fairly distanced every other yacht with
the exception of the Defender, and she,
too, was defeated by four minutes and one
second in a thirty-mile race.
The old cup defender, Vigilant, was beat
en by the two fliers nearly an hour, but
much of this was no doubt due to the
fortunate run of the Columbia and the
Defender along the Fishers Island shore,
while the rest of the fleet kept over on
the other side of the sound. The Amorita
was in the schooner class.
Over fifty yachts crossed the line at
New London and nearly all finished In
Gardlners Hay, although some of them
did not get in until toward night.
The run gave the yachts a good broad
reach to Race Rock of three and a half
miles, a fine run before the wind to Watch
Hill of eight miles and a grand beat â¢of |
eight and a quarter miles in a constantly
increasing breeze to the finishâ an ideal
course all around.
By far the greatest event of the day !
was the magnificent seven-mile run of the |
Columbia from Fishers Island to i Great
Gull Island, during which she averaged
close to a thlrteen-knot gait. It was on |
this lee that the Columbia pulled out so
far on the Defender, for while the boats
were but a short eighth of a mile apart j
tinder Fishers Island there was nearly a j
mile and a half of water between them I
at Great Gull Island. Born yachts had j
all the wind they could stagger under, j
and the Columbia hauled down her jib j
topsail during a ten minutes' interval
when it blew the hardest. She set it up
again] however, when the Defender began j
to pick up; and held her advantage to the
line. Neither boat was held back a parti- j
cle, It was a good, square test of the'
merits of the old and new boats, and the j
latter may be put down as a good four
minutes faster under the present condi
tions, and with her steel mast in a couple I
of minutes more. â 'â 'â 
Once during the day, just after the
start, the Columbia seemed inactive and
lifeless and the Defender almost got by
her. But just before reaching Race Rock
the new boat seemed to find herself again
and from there she was never in danger,
while her great run on the last leg will
never be forgotten by those who witnessed
it. Summary of Columbia-Defender race:
StartâColumbia, 11:21:22; Defender, 11:21:40.
Columbia, 2:59:59; Defender, 3:04:18.
Elapsed Columbia, ":58:37; Defender,
3:42:35.
Columbia defeats Defender 4 minutes and 19
seconds.
A comparison of the work done by the
two big sloops against the Vigilant, which
finished at 3:27:45. shows that while finish
ing 27 minutes 46 seconds behind the Col- j
umbia, plus 26 minutes 22 seconds of a
lead ahead of the Columbia, the Vigilant
was beaten by 54 minutes 8 seconds over
a course of thirty and a half miles, and
that she was beaten 4.Â°< minutes by the
Defender. ' tf'-." -
What chance has the Shamrock, ask the
expert calculators, if the Vigilant was
able to beat the Britannia at any time?

OFFER EVIDENCE OF THEIR SKILL AS FISHERMEN.
RE. MILLER of the Owl Drug Company and Joseph McCowan of Livermore may relate tales of their prowess as
fishermen with impunity. They have the evidence to prove their case. During a vacation of one week spent at
Capitola they caught eighty-seven salmon, .pending in all fifteen hours with the rod. Their best catch for one day
0 was twenty-four fish, the largest weighing thirty-eight pounds and the smallest nine ounces. This is the banner
"catch of the season on Monterey Bay where rod and reel Is used. Like all fishermen who have had an opportunity
of enjoying this sport, they pronounce It fascinating and exhilarating. Since their return they have been advising their
friends* to go and do likewise.

gin to-morrow afternoon in the world's
bicycle meet. Prospects are for lino
weather, a big crowd and fast racing.
The Queen Park board track, built last
year, i. in the best of condition and ex
perienced riders like* Nat Butler and Ma
jor Taylor say they want no better. The
race of the day will be the one-mile ama
teur championship, and the list of en
tries Includes a. J. Cherry of London,
who holds the English championship;
John Caldow, the Scotch short distance
champion; Taillondiers, the Parisian

try, from a half mile to five mil'-s. Earl
Peabody of Chicago, George of South
Africa; Ingram, Moran, Carters, Brown
and Merrill of the League of American
Wheelmen circuit and a number of local
men. The race is expected to be between
Cherry, Tafllondiers and Peabody The
same riders are entered in the half-mile
amateur.
At the executive meeting of the Inter
national Cycling Association to-day it was
officially decided to recognize only the
League of American . Wheelmen in the
United States. Parle was selected as the
place for the world's meet next year.
President Batchelder of the N. C. A., In
an Interview to-night, said:
"The attitude of the N. C. A. in its
dealings with the international phase has
been more because of a desire to be
friendly with the Canadian Wheelmen's
Association than on account of any real
worth to it. We can easily afford to wail
another year if necessary for International
recognition, by which none will dispute
our position in the United States as the
controlling body in the East and Middle
East. Naturally our riders would like to
compete ln the world's events. It was not
I. C. U. representation we sought at this
time, simply the acceptance of the entries
of our riders pending the settlement of
the recognition question.'''

ASYLUM EMPLOYES TO
MAKE A LEGAL FIGHT
They Claim That the Board of Man
agers Cannot Dismiss
Them.
SAN JOSE. Aug. B.â The employes and
attendants of the Agnews Insane Asylum
i do not intend to relinquish their positions
i without. a legal fight and to protect them
â¢ selves have chipped in and engaged Sen
i ator H. V. Morehouse as counsel. The
recent investigation by the State Lunacy
Commission has stirred them up and ru
mors of wholesale changes have been cur
rent.
The Board of Managers held a meeting
to-night. A communication was received
from Senator Morehouse warning the
managers that they could not dismiss em
ployes or attendants at the asylum. He
stated that the board could only remove
the medical director and that the dis
charge of other employes lay with the
medical director, and then on"*,- after a
fair . and impartial trial. The Governor,
however, had the- power to remove the
managers. Senator Morehouse further
stated that this law was made in order
to remove asylums from the control of
politicians.
Things are not running .very smoothly
at Agnews. To-morrow the Investigation
into the treatment of a patient named
Iverson will come up. Iverson suffered
from a broken leg and It Is alleged that
Dr. Stocking was negligent in treating
him. Dr. Stocking is first assistant physi
cian and this Investigation is said to he
caused by Dr. Sponogle and his friends,
who are afraid that Dr. Stocking wilÂ» be
promoted to medical director.
It Is certain a new medical director will
be appointed as a result of Schaffer's In
vestigation. The candidates for the place
are numerous, among them being Dr. S.
P. Tuggle of San Francisco. Dr. C. 11
Freeman of Angela Camp, Dr. G. B.

A Diminutive Baby.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. B.â What is in many
respects the most remarkable child ever
born in Sonoma County made Its appear
ance at the home of Mr. and Mrs. L. Mor
rison, near Windsor, on Wednesday.
Shortly after her arrival the little miss
was weighed, and fully dressed she tipped
the scales at Just a pound and a half.
Both the father and mother are very
proud of this little daughter. She is as
bright and active a youngster as one
would wish to see, and despite her dimin
utive size bids fair to soon overcome the
handicap placed against her by Dame Na
ture in the race of life. Two days after
her birth the little girl was comfortably
cradled ln an ordinary vegetable dish.
Changes at San Quentin.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Aug. B.â
Governor Gage proves an able second of
Warden Aguirre in the work of nepotism
now going on here. The howl over the
creation of a special office for Don Jose
Aguirre has scarcely died away, and yet
it is definitely learned that at Gage's be
hest Aguirre Intends in the near future
to appoint John Reaves of Los Angeles,
a brother-in-law of the Governor, to suc

Cooper Does Not Blame Montague.
Phil Montague says that in no manner
whatever did he attempt to cajole Harry
Cooper, who went his security for a bill
of printing with the Sunset Photo En
graving Company. Cooper, according to
his statement, agreed to stand good for
something less than $20 worth of goods
and not for any indebtedness which was
incurred later. While no limit was placed
upon Cooper's original agreement Mon
tague says that this was understood and
that Cooper holds him In no respect re
sponsible for the recent attachment
placed upon him. "The Sunset people,"
says Mr. Montague, "filed this attach
ment simply because of a little grievance
they had with Cooper. They know that
they will get their money from Bloom and
myself as soon as the books which they
finished for us are placed on the market;
but they are taking advantage of Cooper's
kindness to us to give vent to their own
personal spite against him. Cooper knows
this and holds us In no way responsible."
Nicaragua Canal Report.
At a. meeting of the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday it was
decided to request President McKinley
to have printed the report of the Nicar

this important document have from time

the article In its entirety has never been

BUFFALO, N. V. ( Aug. B.âSearch
light's three heats in the 2:04 pace at
the Fort Erie grand circuit meeting
this afternoon were the fastest ever
paced or trotted in Canada. Frank Bo
gash was not able, however, to crowd
the winner to the limit. Searchlight al
ways sold a heavy favorite In the pool
ing.
A big crowd turned out for the second
day of the meeting. Spear laid up Royal
Baron, the Merchant and Manufactur
ers' stakes winner, for two heats in
the 2:24 trot, the Electricity stake, and
then came on and outfooted Owyhee at
the wire for two heats. With the pools
selling $25 on the Baron to $5 on the
field they came out for the fifth heat.
Spear took the Baron far back and in
the stretch, although he was surely
catching the leader, one hundred yards
from the wire it looked like a fight. At
that time, however, the Baron left his
feet and galloped under the wire sec
ond. It was a big upset and Nick
Hubinger dropped a lot of money.
After three good heats ln the 2:20
trot the sun, at 7:10 o'clock, was still
streaming over the track, but the
judges decided to postpone the trot un
til to-morrow. This did not suit Lock
wood, with George Carney, who had
two heats and was beating his party
to pieces. He protested to no avail and
then, after the judges and spectators
left, he came out alone and did a mile
in 2:38 and claimed the race on the
ground that there was no occasion for
postponing the race and that the rules
sustained him. The judges to-night
said they would call Carney to-morrow
with the others, and if he did not show
up they would expel Lock wood.

FAVORED WITH
A NEW OFFICE
J. P. Jackson Jr. Gets
the Job.
- â â¦ â
SECRETARY TO HIS FATHER
â â
COMPLIMENTARY APPOINTMENT
BY THE TREASURY.
â¦
New Berth Created by the Presiden
tial Civil Service Proclamation.
Salary Two Thousand
Dollars a Year.
Customs Collector Jackson is being con
gratulated by his friends upon the high
esteem in which he is held by the Secre
tary of the Treasury. A year or two ago
the Secretary appointed Stanley Jackson,
one "of the Collector's sons, to the im
portant position of Deputy Collector, at
a salary of" $3600 per annum, and only a
month ago the Secretary appointed an
other son, John P. Jackson Jr., as the
confidential clerk and secretary to Collec
tor Jackson, at a salary of $2000 per an
num. â¢
Five sons remain unappointed.
Collector Jackson modestly refrained
from informing the reporters on the Fed
eral detail of the good fortune which had
befallen him. The news leaked out un
officially in the usual Custom-house way.
"No," said the Collector yesterday when
asked about the matter. "I did not make
the appointment. The Secretary of the
Treasury made it. John has already as
sumed his official duties. He was ap
pointed in July." - Â'
One pleasant feature in connection with
the appointment in the fact that John I .
Jr. will not be overburdened with work.
Stanley Jackson is special deputy and
acts for the Collector and signs his name
in his absence. Knotty problems of Cus
tom-house law and of International
comity solve themselves automatically as
soon as they are brought within the po
tent influence of the official halo that
brightens the desk of Chief Clerk Jerome.
Stenographer Walter D. Hoyt does all the
official letter writing and typewriting for
.the Collector, so that John P. Jr. has a
clear field for his confidential duties.
The office is a new one, and was cre
ated by President McKinley in his re
cent civil service proclamation. By the
terms of that document Customs Collec
tors whose receipts in any year aggre
gate $500,000 or over are entitled to a con
fidential clerk and secretary, at a salary
of $2000 per annum. Owing to the creation
of a new dutyâ that of 10 cents per pound
on tea and the increased business caused
by the warâ the receipts of the San Fran
cisco Custom-house for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1899, overflowed the $500,000
limit, and, therefore, made:
Customs Collector John P. Jackson
happy- _ , _ ,
Deputy Collector Stanley Jackson
happy. .â â '_ _ _
Confidential Clerk and Secretary John

ORGANIZATION OF
FUEL OIL EXCHANGE
MEETING OF MEN INTERESTED
IN THE INDUSTRY.
Wendell Easton Is Elected President
and He Appoints a Governing
Board to Engineer the
Project.
A meeting of representative men in
terested in the fuel oil Industry was held
: yesterday afternoon in the Merchants'
Exchange for the purpose of establishing
j an oil exchange for the handling of the
' State product, which is assuming large
! proportions owing to the many discoveries
of oil wells throughout the State. Thirty
j charter members were present and the
meeting was called to order by Wendell
Easton.
In outlining the plan of the organization
Mr. Easton stated that the fuel oil industry
| in this State was in its infancy and that
the supply was now being met by the de
! mand. As new properties were discovered,
however competition would become keen
and prices would go down. It was the. In
tention of the promoters to establish an
oil exchange similar to those now in op
eration In Pittsburg and London. The
exchange contemplated the selling of oil
under the certificate plan as now used in
other exchanges, which will assure fair
prices for the article. The meeting then
elected the following officers: President,
Wendell Easton; treasurer, Henry J.
Crocker; secretary, Emile Kahn.
The following committees were also
elected and will act as the governing
board of the exchange: Committee on
administrationâ Joseph Kahn, T. L.
Wooster, E. Gauthier Jr.; committee on
securitiesâ Werner Stauf. Leon Phipps,
Marion Leventrltt; committee on finances
âGeorge F. Beveridge, Louis F. Mont
eagle C. S. Benedict; committee on arbi
trationâJesse W. Llllenthal, Fred W. Me-
Near, George A. Moore.
The meeting adjourned to meet next
Tuesday afternoon at the Merchants' Ex
change, when further plans for the or
ganization will be outlined.

' soldiers' throats still dry from the lusti
ness of their good-bys. They went in a
body, not all from the Presidio as had
been the intention, but they were all at
the ferry depot, and there the regiment
trooped on board the 3 o'clock boat, men.
women and children following after and
all loth to leave or be left behind.
It had been announced to the men of the
regiment before they left camp on Mon
day that they should all march away from
! the Presidio yesterday at 1 o'clock. It
' was not an order, for by 1 o'clock yester
< day the regiment was no more, but it
was an appeal to the men. Human nature
1 could not stand the strain, however, and
: when 1 o'clock came there were not over
100 men at the camp, and a good propor
i tion of these were officers. They were
'â  formed in line by General Summers, how
ever, and with the parting admonition,
i "take plenty of intervals," the men moved
! out of the "post after the Utah men and
: the Nebraska band, who had volunteered
1 to escort them as far as the ferry.
The officers marched together, four
! abreast and after them came the men.
1 There was the involuntary step of the
: trained soldier and the even pace and
1 straight lines and the uniforms, but there
; the military element stopped. The men
: were too happy to keep silence In the
ranks and they did not have to, anyway,
so they laughed and chatted to them
selves and to the crowds which gathered
! and they spoke to friends and called to
! strangers and had a glorious time gen-
I erally all the way to the water front.
The band played its prettiest ana the
artillerymen marched their best, but then
! they were still soldiers, not citizens, as
were the men they led. And It was bet
ter that way perhaps. One was the vol
unteer In service; the other the volunteer
mustered out, and the difference between
â  them told the story of the war and why
there need never be a standing army. The
Utah men will soon march down the street
as gay and happy and light-hearted as the
| Oregon men, and some other waiting regi
ment will walk as sedately and as sol
dierly before them.
On the way down the line of Oregon
men grew larger, for some were waiting
for it at every crner. They just tagged
|on behind, for there was no company
; formation, just a simple column of fours:
no commanding officer, just an old friend
i at the head of the line, and the line kept
! itself with nothing but the habit gained
in months of hard drill to direct it. They
| marched without incident except a few
! displays of enthusiasm by some women,
â¢ who to show their Interest in the regi
ment rushed from the crowds and Insisted
I on kissing General Summers.
At the ferry there were at least 600 men
awaiting the line from the Presidio. They
began coming before 2 o'clock, and before
the boat left at 3 they crowded the ferry
! depot above and below. The parade
! reached the water front In good time for
; the 3 o'clock boat, and after good-bys and
; waving of hats and handkerchiefs, and
: cheers and smiles and tears, the men
boarded the boat and were borne away.
At the Oakland mole their train was
waiting for them. It was in three sec
tions. The first got away soon after the
men reached the mole, and then the oth
ers slipped out after It, and before night
the last of the Oregon men were on their
way home.
It was payday in the volunteer camps
at the Presidio yesterday, and as a conse
quence the Utah. Nebraska and Pennsyl
vania men stayed in camp until that inter
esting ceremony was over. Each man
l drew pay for the month of June.
Colonel Girard, commandant of the gen
i eral hospital at the Presidio, is preparing
! to discharge all men able and willing to
be discharged under the recent permis
sion of the department allowing the dis
charge of men before their regiments
come home. He will discharge between
I thirty and forty men at .once. *

OPPOSING DEALERS ADVISING
AGAINST HIS CONTRACTS.
â¦
Ihe Capitalist Frankly States His
Position and Warns Grape Men
He May Withdraw His
Offer.
The situation in the wine business In
connection with the offer of Henry J.
Crocker to pay $14 and $12 per ton for
grapes for a period of seven years is
assuming an ominous aspect so far as
Mr. Crocker is concerned. The growers
seem to have overlooked the mostly ex
perience of many years past when the
market for grapes was an open one and
there was no fixed value. This is in
dicated by a statement issued by Mr.
Crocker yesterday bearing upon the
issue at hand. It seems that there are
certain parties, merchants and wine
makers, who are urging the grape
growers not to sign the contracts. A
comment made on this feature of 'he
case and which should guide every
grape grower in arriving at a conclu
sion is: What guarantee will the men
who are opposing the signing of the
contracts make as to the price of grapes
for the next seven years? This is a
query that Mr. Crocker and his finan
cial backers would like to have taken
into consideration. Mr. Crocker's
statement follows:
Â© The position of the viticultural Â¥
â¢v interests of the State is as follows: <$>
O I have made an offer to the grape O
<â¢â¢ grower which has grown out of my <?>
0 experience in handling the Wine O
-y Makers' Corporation. 'Â«>
9 The grape grower has an offer C*
â * never before dreamed of in the his- *>
9 tory of the State and after months Â°
*! of consideration with all the open- Â¥
9 ness and fairness of public meet- Â°
*** ings and press comment, and sub- <**
O *â¢â¢' * to the most searching criti- o
.;. cicm, he decided almost unani- ,;.
0 mously to accept my proposition. Q
; The marplot now steps in con- .
'~ sisting of the wine maker or deal- *?
9 er, who advises the grape grower ~
-'^ to reconsider his opinion; tells Â¥
9 him I am getting up a gigantic O
*â â¢â¢ trust, and that I am a detriment **â 
9 to the business. 9
â¢ As president of the Wine Mak- Â£
V ers' Corporation I took hold of 9
Â£.' their affairs. I secured them over '*'
t" a million dollars to harvest their 9
' crops. 1 paid the judgment of *_)

Â«â¢ gallon. I paid back the money 'i.'
O borrowed out .if the result of these ,7,

<$> to their affairs; was neither offered <->
O nor would I take any remunera- <*,
<v tion for my services. q
O When they concluded to settle up A
<$> their affairs I was asked to think 1.
C of a proposition that would meet 9
.â¦â  the views of all concerned, and '-'
6 the suit was my offer of $14 per O
<t> ton. â¢ <.Â»>
I shall withdraw my offer as
soon as the wine maker or dealer
works the disruption of my plan.
He is an active worker in the fleld;
his footsteps are plainly visible,
and when in the future the grower
compares the offer he will receive
from these parties with mine he
will be able to measure the conse
quences.
I have nothing to say in behalf
of my offer. I am not in the fleld
to make it go, nor have I any
agents except self-constituted ones
who see the beneficial results to be
obtained.
I have the funds secured for
seven years to carry out my plans.
I shall endeavor to make it a pay
ing proposition to the grape
grower, the wine-maker and the
dealer, as well as a safe invest
ment for the financial Interest
backing It. and shall take my prin
cipal compensation In the satisfac
tion of having benefited a great in
dustry and added many millions of
dollars to the wealth of the State.
MECHANICS' INSTITUTE FAIR.
Preparations for San Francisco's Big
Show Are Well Under Way.
The trustees of Mechanics' Institute
held a special meeting last evening to con
sider matters pertaining to the annual fair,
which will open in the pavilion on the
night of September 2. It was decided that
the opening exercises should be held In
the pavilion on the opening night, instead
of in some downtown theater, as formerly.
A communication was received from tlie
Regents of the State University to the ef
fect that they had appropriated $200 for
the university exhibit. A letter was also
received from Mrs. Phoebe Hearst offering
to place on exhibition the plans for the
contemplated improvements at the univer
sity after they have been passed upon ny
the Judges.
The work at the pavilion is progressing
rapidly, and the Filipino actors will begin
training for their exhibit at once. All the
Filipinos are in good health with the ex
ception of the baby born a few days ago,
which is suffering from some infantile ail
ment.

the cultivation of certain false methods
of delivery. The affliction generally takes
the form of tricks of speech, faults
mainly gathered from the star, to whom

CHARLOTTE THOMPSON.
Tivoli's New Prima Donna.
Long after the echoes of the present
I Tivoli grand opera season have died away
I there will remain in the memory of those
I who attended "Faust" last evening a
| Marguerite the like of which is but rarely
I found. You may have heard the role ren
i dered by vocalists of wider reputation
1 than that of Mme. de Pasquali. you may
have succumbed to the fame of one or the
other Marguerites, but it is an indisput
able fact that you have never heard it
sung any better. Mme. Pasquali's so
prano is so caressing, so pure, that it
i rings in your ears like the dying sound of
j a silver bell. She phrases with an exacti
| tude and care that bring every note into
bold relief, and, most of all, she sings
j with so much taste and warm color and
i a temperament that rouses enthusiasm.
! But one seldom has an opportunity to see
'< Marguerite acted as well as sung and it
la exceedingly gratifying to note that
i Mme. de Pasquali makes the histrionic
part of Marguerite as important as the
musical.
In view of the fact that Mme. de Pas
quali has hitherto devoted most of her
time to concert work it Is but fair to state j
j that after such a tremendous success she j
! should remain on the operatic stage. The j
! Jewel song was a masterpiece of first i
t grade and received two most enthusiastic
encores. In the trio she became even dra
matic and in no instance did she forget >
that she had to be actress as well as :
! singer. Mme. de Pasquali has a brilliant ;
future. She is a native of Boston and !
; studied in New York. This is a striking ,
i example of the fact that America -can
produce great singers without the assist- I
: ance of Europe. _MK"f_f

purpose of organizing clubs among the

What he wanted was the protection of
the young girls who are obliged to work

lend a helping hand.
Airs. John t'ettee made a lengthy speech
in which she berated the clergy for their

7 o'clock last evening. Whether or not she
was a victim of self-destruction or wheth-
er death was due to natural causes re-
mains to be determined.
Mrs. Dunn engaged a room during the
afternoon. She told the bell boy, who hud
known her for some time, that she was
not feeling well, and asked to be called
at the hour of 7. The servant advised the
woman to take a good sleep, and she
promised to do so.
At the appointed hour the required call
was made, but there was no response. It
was finally found necessary to force the
door, and Mrs. Dunn was found dead. A
flask of whisky, part of the contents of
which had been consumed, was found on
the table, and a towel had been hung
over the keyhole to prevent any one look-

had been done by the husband to cure her,
but in vain. She had been here several
months under the care of physicians, out
could not conquer her habit. After in
dulging in liquor she would become mel
ancholy and develop the suicidal mania.
The hapless woman had made several at
tempts to take her life, the latest being a
week ago last Sunday, when she tried to
jump off the Fourth-street wharf. A by
stander interfered and Mrs. Dunn was
taken to the Central Station and locked
up for the night. During her incarcera
tion she asked for a hatpin, with which
to kill herself, and later attempted to tear
open the artery of her arm with her teeth.
On this occasion she was saved by a cell-
I mate. About a year ago Mrs. Dunn took
' - large dose of morphine, and when her
husband discovered the fact she begged
him to let her die and end her misery.

the sympathy of all who knew of her
weakness. At the time of her death a di

DIED ON THE STREET.
Mrs. Mamie Cusick Found Lifeless in
a Doorway.
Mrs. Mamie Cusiek. a woman about 26
years of age, was found dead in a door
way at 1646 Market street about half-past
6 o'clock last evening. The cause of her
death is yet a mystery, but it is the opin

Pedestrians on Market street found the
unfortunate woman crouched in the door

lv The policeman, thinking that life
might possibly not he extinct, called a
patrol wagon and had her driven to the i
Receiving Hospital. Upon her arrival
there it was found that she was dead and
the Coroner's office was notified. Depu- j
ties Flaimigan and La Combe conveyed I
the .body to the Morgue.
Mrs Cusiek a husband was a paper- '
hanger in this city and has been dead one j

woman, resides at' 6S Herman street, at
which address the latter has recently i
made her home at intervals.
An i-iouest will be held on the remains I
to determine the cause of death. Nothing
was found on the body which would pro

j The bark Colusa arrived in port from
, Kahului yesterday with a list to star
! board. She has aboard 30,150 bags of sugar
; and some of it has been damaged. On
; August 5 and 6 she was caught In a strong
! northeast gale. A very heavy sea fol
lowed, which caused the vessel to labor
i and finally shift cargo to starboard. The
j Colusa has not been ln port for a long
: time, as she has been in the lumber trade
! between Puget Sound and Australia-
' The French bark Jacques arrived from
Newcastle, Australia, in the good time of
sixty-three days yesterday, and was fol
lowed into port a few hours later by the
1 American bark General -*airchild. in a
passage of eighty days. The French
barks Jacques, Bretagne and Dugesclin
, all left Newcastle, Australia, for San
1 Francisco on the same day, while the bark
Lamoriciere sailed a week ahead of them.
Each captain expected to be the first to
reach this port, but Captain Bernadac
beat them all and at the same time made
the best run of the season.
There was trouble on the ship Standard
' yesterday. The tug Rescue was alongside
ready to tow her to Portland to load for
Australia, when at the last moment Cap
| tain Backus refused to go out in the ship.
j There was a hurried consultation, and
I about 4 p. m. a lot of extra supplies were
! put aboard. Finally, the matter was ad
justed and the ship was towed to sea.
â¢ The steamer City of Sydney was char
tered by the Government from the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company yesterday.
She will be got ready at once to carry
troops to Manila.
Hugh McCreedy. a machinist on the
hospital ship Relief, met with a peculiar
i accident yesterday. He was working on
; a valve of the Ice machine, and thinking
all the ammonia was out of the reservoir
â  he was not as careful as he might have
| been. Suddenly the stopcock blew out
and struck him a severe blow on the chest
that doubled him up. As he bent forward
I the ammonia spurted out of the open vent
| and struck him full in the face, burning
him very badly. He was treated aboard |
the Relief.

j Harbor Commissioners Meet, i
At the regular meeting of the Harbor
Commissioners yesterday afternoon Chief
Engineer Holmes submitted plans and
specifications for the construction of the
Santa Fe terminal, car ferry and freight
slip, at the foot of Main street. The plans
were adopted by the board, and Secretary
English was directed to advertise for bids.
The Santa Fe officials were invited *o
meet the Commissioners in their office on
J Thursday at 11 o'clock to express their
views as to when they desire the slip com
pleted.
The approach to the slip is to be 400 feet
I long, and an apron. 100 by 24 feet, will be
i worked by hydraulic power and a coun
terpoise weighing 100,000 pounds. The
bridge proper will weigh 200,000 pounds In
all. It is thought that the slip can be
completed by January 1. 1900.
Informal bids will be asked for the lay
ing of a bituminous pavement in front
of the ferry building in anticipation of
the return of the California Volunteers.
The sewers now* being constructed on
Dupont street were ordered to be* contin
ued into the bay across North Point
street, which is State property, at a cost
of $1500. ;
M. Cordes addressed the board on the
| subject of eucalyptus piles, and will dis-
I tribute eighty of them along the front for
! experimental purposes.
Captain Monroe of the steamer Pro
greso, which ran into Main-street wharf
recently, sent a cheek for $35 to repair
the damage, as he considered himself to
I blame. The captain's voluntary action
excited the favorable comment of the
j members of the board. ; ;-tftf .â ,-. .-.--,*,

PIONEERS' REUNION.
Surviving Passengers of the Old
Panama Meet in the Bohe
mian Club.
The surviving passengers and crew of
the ship Panama, which arrived in San
Francisco Bay fifty years ago (August S,
1*49), were the guests of George D. Dor
nin at the Bohemian Club last evening.
There were present William H. Bod
fish, son of the captain; ex-Supervisor
William H. Hilton, capitalist. Berkeley;
Harry N. Morse, of the Morse Detective
Agency and George D. Dornin, Insurance
n*anag"er. George W. Dornin, a Native
Son, was also a guest. >â â '-:. -.â  tf
A reminiscent letter, excusing himself
because of illness, was read from Henry
Williams of the H. A. Williams Company
on Market street, â  Ctftftf- -'.-â¢.
The ship Panama, Captain Russell S.
Bodtish, sailed from New York on Feb
ruary 3. 1549. and after a voyage of IS6
days, reached San Francisco on August S. ]
Her passengers and crew numbered 220
souls. â â * '-.."'â  â 'â¢".-'-â¢" :"
Soon after her arrival the Panama was
sold to Macondray & Co. and utilised as ;
a storehouse. Subsequently she was sold !
to the Seamen's Bethel Association, :
hauled up on the flats in the neighbor- j
hood of the present Sacramento and Da- |
vis streets and converted into a church,
the space between decks being utilized
for church purposes. A more pretentious i
superstructure was placed upon her sub- j
sequently. She was burned in one of the I
Â«arl** fires.

COURTING TRADE.
Manufacturers', and Wholesalers'
League to Entertain Their
Guests.
The officers of the Manufacturers' and
Wholesalers' League are highly pleased
with the progress made by the members
in perfecting plans for inducing buyers
to make their purchases In this city in
stead of sending orders for goods to the
East. As has been previously stated, it.
is necessary to offer some inducement to
the country merchants to make the de
sired change, and this is what the
league is doing. In the first place efforts
will be made to have buyers come to the
city and deal with the wholesalers direct.
One important feature is similar to that
practiced by the wholesalers of some of
the Eastern cities, offering transportation
to and from the city at greatly reduced
rates.
Several of the railroads of the Coast
States have offered rates that will make
transportation very cheap. More than
â¢this, the rates will apply to the families
of the prospective buyers. The officers
of the league yesterday received a com
munication from the proprietors of the
best hotels in the city stating that they
would make reductions in board and lodg
ing during the stay of-the visitors from
the country. The-managers of the thea
ters also agreed to entertain those In
dorsed by the league at special prices.

Mf-IKE IT A PUBLIC HOLIDAY.
rROM tlie degree of popular interest already dis
played in the work of preparation for the wel
come of the California volunteers it is evident
that on the occasion of their arrival in the city the
people will be satisfied with nothing less than a pub
lic holiday. All classes of patriotic citizens will desire
to participate in the reception, and it is but right they
should have an opportunity in the freedom of a gen
eral holiday to do so.
While the date upon which the volunteers will ar
rive is not known and cannot be definitely determined
at this time, the arrangements which have been made
ior the reception are such as will allow the Governor
ample time in which to issue his proclamation for a
holiday on the date when the troops will land. Ac
cording to the plan adopted for the reception the
transports will arrive at the Faraliones at noon, and
the news of the arrival will be at once dispatched to
every locality in the State. If the Governor then act
promptly in declaring the following day a legal holi
day, the information can be received in time to be
acted upon throughout California-
It is right and fitting that such a holiday should be
declared. Californians have a just pride in the record
of the volunteers, who were the first to respond to the
call of the President for the war with Spain. In the
Philippines they distinguished themselves for valor
and discipline even in that army of ardent and heroic
men. Having been the first of the volunteers to enter
the service they are among the latest to be discharged.
.They turn to us, therefore, with every honor that
accrues to those who have faithfully performed the
dangerous duties of a soldier's life, and it is but nat
ural all citizens should feel a desire to join in the
throngs that will welcome them home.
The preparations that have been made by the com
mittee in charge of the reception are of a nature that
w ill fully serve for the demonstrations ot a public
holiday. The decorations of the city by day, the il
luminations at night, the parades, the receptions and
the other festivities will suffice to make the occasion
one of the most festal in our history.
â¢ The number of persons directly interested in the
occasion, including the relatives and friends of the
volunteers, the Native Daughters and the Native
Sons, is so considerable that every portion of the
community and all classes of citizens are within the
sphere of their influence. All, therefore, will desire
the freedom of a holiday in which to join in the cele
bration. A widespread, popular demand of this char
acter ought to be gratified. All business and labor
should be suspended for the day. Every clerk and
every workingman â all employers and employes â
should have the day free for the untrammeled delight
of welcoming the heroes home.
STREET PAVING .SUGGESTIONS-
WITH the current number 'of the Merchants' As
sociation Review the third anniversary of the
association is noted, but no adequate summary
is given of the work accomplished for the year. The
neglect was doubtless due to the amount of space re
quired to publish reports dealing with important is
sues of our municipal government.
The leading place in the review is given to the re
port of the committee upon the tax levy for the year,
a subject which has been so fully discussed by the
press as to render further comment unnecessary, par
ticularly as the levy has now been made within the
dollar limit recommended by the association.
The discussion of street paving is continued from
the July number, and the experience of Eastern cities
is cited for our guidance. The report is made by L.
M. King, superintendent of the association, and is
based upon personal investigation of street paving in
the East.
Of our bituminous rock pavements it is said they
are unsatisfactory for three causes first, they are
composed of a natural mixture and therefore not of
uniform quality; second, they are not laid in the best
manner; third,, they are not kept in repair, and when
repairs -ire made the work is frequently poorly per
formed. It is stated that if a binder course were laid
over the concrete, thus securing firm adhesion be
tween the foundation and surface coat, and the pave
ment were rolled with heavy steam rollers imme
diately after being laid and while hot, much of the
waviness and uneven surface would be avoided.
Of the basalt block pavements it is said they should
be laid on concrete foundations, and the joints filled
with gravel and asphalt or coal tar cement. It is main
tained, however, that we should no longer confine
ourselves to the use of bituminous rock, basalt blocks
on sand and cobbles, but make use of asphalt, vitri
fied brick and asphalted wood.
The conclusions, which are the same as those re
commended by President Dohrmann, are as follows:
'.'First â Admit asphalt, vitrified brick and asphalted
wood block pavement under proper specifications.
Second Change the specifications for bituminous
rock paving so as to require the use of a binder, and
also that the pavements shall be rolled while hot with
steam rollers. â Require that all business streets
when repaved with basalt blocks shall have the block**
laid on a concrete foundation and shall be grouted
with gravel and asphaltic cement. Fourth Arrange,
if possible, so that all pavements shall be guaranteed
for ten years with good surety bonds. Fifth â the
work of repairing the basalt block and cobble streets
shall be done systematically. Sixth That the city it
self undertake the work of making repairs over
trenches in the pavement made by corporations and
plumbers. Finally â Do away with the prevailing idea
that cheapness is the main consideration. Good work
costs money, but, if properly performed, is always
worth the cost"
THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS.
BY the results of the elections yesterday the ex
cellence of the new primary election law has
been fully attested. A closer scrutiny when
more time is given for a study of all the details of its
j operation may disclose minor defects here and there,
! but of the essential merit of the law there can be no
| longer any dispute. It has given honest citizens an
! opportunity to take part in the primaries with the as
| surance of having fair play, and they have to a large
tent profited by.it.
The victory and the triumph of the day is the sue
! cess of the better element of the Republican party in
i the contest against the bosses. That contest was, in
j fact, the only important issue of the elections. At
the Democratic primaries it was but a struggle of
.boss against boss; a case of dog eat dog. From the
' results of the Democratic primaries, therefore, no
. : valuable lesson can be drawn.
In the Republican primaries the contest was made
|in earnest for good government. The taxpayers, the
I property-owners, the industrious working-men of the
: party, responded to the appeal of The Call and took
; up the fight against the would-be bosses of the party
: j and achieved a signal and impressive victory. The
I party convention will be made up of representative
j men, to whom the people can look with reasonable
; expectation for a good ticket.
It is now clear that under the new primary law good
! citizens will be no longer at the mercy of a political
: boss, and if they surrender to him it will be their own
! fault. Republicans have shown they will not consent
; to have their party controlled by bosses having head
i quarters in saloons and relying for power upon ward
strikers of the lowest type. In .the Republican camp
: the saloon boss has been overthrown, and encourage
! ment has thus been given to the better class of Demo
j crats to make a similar fight for the purification of
'. their party in the next election.
For the present the political interest of the city
: centers in the Republican convention. It matters
, little whether the Buckley gang, that of Rainey and.
the Examiner or that of the Committee of One Hun
: dred win out in the Democratic fight. A strong Re-
I publican ticket, nominated by such men as were j
I elected yesterday, will command the votes not only of ]
all Republicans but of all independent citizens and of j
I a considerable number of Democrats who have suffi- j
, cient intelligence and civic patriotism to set the pub
j lie welfare above mere partisanship.
j Every indication of the day points to a triumph for
good citizenship in the coming election. The worth
iof the primary law has been vindicated. The business
! men and the workingmen who, in compliance with
! the urgings of The Call, left their private interests for
I a while to go to the polls have the satisfaction of
; knowing this morning that they have saved their party
; from the domination of saloon bosses and taken a
! long step toward assuring the inauguration of the
j municipal government under the new charter by a
! thoroughly representative Republican administration.
As the platform of the Democratic State conven
tion in Maryland says nothing at all about free silver,
; or gold standard, or anything else relating to the
j monetary problems of the country, it may be accepted
! as an evidence that Gorman is in the fight against
Bryan and is making it easy for all sorts of Demo
â¢ crats to stand with him without crowding one
I another.
There was a deficit in the revenues of the Treasury
in July amounting to more than $8,500,000, but as it
was the smallest July deficit we have had in five
years, there is nothing to fret about. A few years
more o( Republican administration and we will be

It appears Carnegie has been appointed a "Justice of

LOST IDEALS.
A SHORT time ago Mr. Vardaman, a Demo
cratic leader of some repute in Mississippi, an
nounced his opposition to the education of the
negro and said:
"It is folly, and criminal folly, to talk about ad
vancing the negro race by education. The negro
is not permitted to advance, and his education simply
spoils a good field hand and makes a shyster lawyer
or fourth-rate teacher. It is simply money thrown
away. Booker Washington's school is no better than
the others. It would be all right in a nation of
negroes, but it is useless in the South. There is no
field of usefulness for its graduates. We might a3
well look the matter squarely in the face. It is .futile
to attempt to elevate the negro. The education of
the race would be a discouraging task under any con
ditions. Under those that exist and will continue to
exist in Mississippi it is simply preposterous."
Prior to the outbreak of imperialism and the new
craze for "killing niggers" in the Philippines for the
purpose of extending commerce, such a speech, com
ing from a responsible leader in the South, would
have been greeted by the Republican press with con
demnation short and sharp. The conscience of the
North would have been appealed to, and Republicans
would have been everywhere aroused to continue the
struggle' for enforcing throughout all parts of the
Union the law which gives to the colored man, as
well as to the white man, the right to an education
and to the freedom to enjoy it.
It has been noted by the New York Post, however,
that no such outburst has taken place now. In fact,
some stanch Republican papers, even in New Eng
land, speak rather commendingly of it. The Post
points to these comments as an evidence that Republi
can ideals have been lost, by such papers as have been
affected by the imperial craze, and they are now as
willing to make the negro a mere burden bearer in the
South as to reduce to subjection the natives of the
Philippines.
In summing up a review of the changed tone of so
many imperial organs, which still call themselves Re
publican, the Post says:
"We are maintaining absolute government in Cuba,
and trying to set it up in the Philippine Islands.
Whoever does not submit and obey is shot, just as ob
streperous negroes are shot in the Southern States.
Doubtless our fellow citizens of the South would
say that after the negroes had been taught to submit
and behave themselves they might be elevated. But
they demand entire submission first, and no imperial
member of the Republican part}', nor any militant ex
panisonist. can consistently denounce them. Our Gov
ernment has adopted the "shotgun policy" abroad, and
people that support it are estopped from condemning

similar practices at' home. This result is exactly what
was predicted when we rushed into war, and it is to be
hoped that many who thought that war might be -made
a civilizing agency are learning from experience what
they would not learn from reason."
Vice-Chairman Stone of the Democratic National
Committee says that in 1900 Democracy will not fuse
with Populism or anything else, so it is clear Tom
Watson pointed a moral even if he did not adorn the
tale of Democracy in 1896.
THE FLIGHT CF THE KISSING BUG.
OUT of the infinite there descended upon the
United States early in the summer a dreadful,
horrible, invisible, monstrous thing, which
soon became known far and wide as "'the kissing
bug." A denizen of the night, black as a bat and as
noiseless as a ghost, the creature came and menaced
the land. So portentous was he, and so widespread
was the panic fear of him, the summer was robbed
of its best joys. No maiden would venture out alter
dark for a moonlight walk, and the boys. who were
caught out after the shades of night had been pulled
down stayed where they were, not daring to go home
until dawn.
The first stingful* kiss of the monster was reported
from New Jersey, but immediately thereafter he was
heard from all along the Atlantic coast, from Cape
May to Bar Harbor. From every salient point on that
long line the rumors started west, and soon reports of
the kissing were heard from every prairie, plain and
j mountain. First we would hear of a gentle girl hay
! ing the kissing spring of her sweet lip broken by a
j caress of the bug, then would come a tale of a young
i man getting his optics bunged out of sight by the
! creature. More fearful stories came later. Tragedies
! began to pour in, and for a time it was a dull day j
with the Associated Press when it did not have sev
-1 eral kissing bug fatalities to give a deep, dark tint to
the news of the day.
During the period when the creature raged almost
I every kind of injury done in the land was attributed !
ito him. Whenever an old soak "had 'em again" he j
j swore he had seen a kissing bug. When Fitzsimmons j
I awoke after the knockout blow, he asked his weeping ;
I seconds, "Was it Jeffries or a kissing bug?" When j
Bryan was silent for a week a rumor ran round the j
I land that the kissing bug had landed him one on the ,
jaw. r !
i For a time all sorts of creatures were suspected of \
j being the kissing bug. Entomologists were called upon
! to examine every kind of insect thing the wide repub-
I lie of the United States can furnish. In no instance,
however, was a specimen of the bug discovered. The
creature remained as invisible as he was dreadful.
', There were swollen lips, blackened eyes and distorted
noses in evidence all over the country, and there were
: veracious and reliable people who had seen the
1 corpses of persons slain by the bug, but the bug him
: self no one ever saw.
Suddenly, without warning, the bug came, and as
j suddenly he went. Mose Gunst never did the turn of
came and went more quickly. The bug was with us all
over the Union but a week or so ago, and now he is
nowhere. The boys and the girls have resumed their
moonlight rambles at the summer resorts, the dark
: ness no longer .has terrors for young or old. The
1 kissing.bug has gone.
During the thrill. of excitement which stirred the
hearts of the people just before the outbreak of the j
' war with Spain a certain, or perhaps it was an uncer- j
tain, yellow journal offered $100,000 reward for the j
men who blew up the Maine. The money has never
i been called for, and the sum is therefore available for
:an equally useful purpose. Let it be promptly offered
: for a kissing bug. j
Examiner reporters may breathe easy again. Now
that the City Receiving Hospital has been reopened
they will not have to submit to vaccination to swell
the list of fake cases in the yellow fellow's latest
costless charity.
A MOVEMENT has been started by the Manu
facturers' and Wholesalers' League to attract
trade to San Francisco through inducements
offered to merchants in the Pacific Coast States â
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona,
New Mexico â and British Columbia. Among the in
ducements to be offered are reduced transportation
rates to and from the city, and reduced charges at
hotels and theaters.
Such an undertaking is not a novelty in American
| commercial life. Some years ago Chicago offered
I special inducements to retailers in the Southern States
-. with the object of drawing that vast trade from East
| crn cities to Chicago. The venture proved so success-
I ful that New York was compelled to offer equal in
! ducements not to Southern merchants only but to
1 those of all parts of the country. Since then every
, large commercial center in the East, from Boston, to
I St. Louis, has adopted the plan, and it has now be
-1 come an established feature of commercial activity in
i the older parts of the Union.
The effect of the inducements offered by the rival
| cities of the East has been felt even at this distance,
and not a few Pacific Coast buyers have been moved
by them to make the long journey to the East to pur
; chase, goods that might have been obtained in this
i city upon equally advantageous terms. Such being
; the condition of affairs it is clear our wholesalers and
! manufacturers must exert themselves to hold the trade
i qf their natural market or it will be taken from them
| by their energetic competitors beyond the mountain**.
Of course an enterprise of this kind will have little
or no success unless carried out upon a large scale
and supported by merchants and manufacturers gen
erally. A considerable expenditure of money and
energy will be required to get the movement well
started, and if any large number of dealers show a de
sire to profit by the enterprise without sharing in the
work or in the expense, those engaged in promot
ing it will soon weary. For that reason there ought
to be a cordial co-operation of all dealers who are
concerned in the upbuilding of our wholesale trade.
The plan outlined by the committee in charge of
the undertaking has been well considered. and prom
ises to yield good results. It is one of the many new
movements in business circles which are breaking up
the past conservatism in trade, methods and starting
currents of increasing activity and energy. As the
only metropolitan city within thousands of miles, San
Francisco has naturally a strong attraction to all peo
ple on the Pacific Coast and if the league add to those
natural advantages the further inducements it is pro
posed to hold out to merchants and traders of the in
terior, the results can hardly fail to be of vast benefit
to. the whole community.
It is now evident good citizens will attend primary
elections when they are assured of fair play and an
honest count, and it is further evident that when they
do go to the polls victory is theirs. ,
There will be about as many objectors this morning
to the primary law as there are bosses and ward
striker*

When We Have the Best of Him.
From Life-.
THE newspapers tell of a curious mis
fortune that has overtaken Archie H.
Brower - of Bonesteel, S. D. Mr.
Brower was part owner of a tent
show, whereof sn important attraction
was an animal which the showman de
clared to be the missing link. They laid
stress on the inability of any observer to
determine whether the creature was a
monkey or a man. Unfortunately, this
missing link got fractious the other day.
and Brower, losing patience, hit it so hard
on the head with a club that it inconti
nently died. Now Brower is sure it was
only a monkey, but the authorities of
Bonesteel doubt his competence as an an
thropologist, and have bound him over
under charge of murder to await the judg
ment of the grand jury.
Uncle Sam and all of us are in a posi
tion to sympathize heartily with Mr.
Brower. We have had a missing link in
our show for nearly a year now, and for
months past he has been fractious, and
we have been pounding him on the head
in the effort to make him behave, squab
bling all the time among ourselves as to
his standing as a ' creature. We must
hope that our missing link, which has
more lives than Brower's, .will survive
the discussion; but, in any case, we
ought to be thankful that no grand jury
is likely to pass upon our actions.

LATEST STORIES
of the
FUNNY MAN.
He Had a it.
The merchant uttered a sharp exclama
tion and sank back in his chair. A tele
gram fell from his shaking hand. His
eyes were wide, his face white, and beads
of perspiration stood on his brow. The
men in the outer offlce whispered among
themselves.
"Touch of heart disease?" asked one. â¢
"No; the old man \ can't make up a
note," said another. "I've heard rumors
of that kind. We fellows will have to be
looking for another place." â¢-.-â â ;
"(let to workâ he's coming to again."
The merchant wiped his brow, fetched a
despairing sigh, picked up the paper from
the floor, frowned and stamped his foot,
as if to summon all his resolution, placed
the telegram on his desk and forced him
self to read the bitter message. This
was it:
"Dearest James: Please send the waist

Needed a Shave.
He had been out so late the night before
that he did not know at what hour he had
come home. When he awoke he was
curious to learn just how "rocky" he
looked. He accordingly reached out for
the silver-backed hand mirror that lay on
the table beside his bed. Instead of it he
got hold of the silver-backed hair brush.
Not recognizing his mistake he took the
brush up and gazed at the bristles for a
moment. Then he felt of the silver back
and then stared back at the bristles.
"Good heavens," he murmured at iast,
"but I need a shave."â Argonaut.

In order to save time Mr. Boardman
consented that a pro forma order giving
judgment for the respondents be en

The regents of the University of Cali

though much business was submitted but
little was definitely accomplished. The
absolute power with which the new presi

dent Wheeler, and that he immediately
signify his decision in the matter.
A gratifying recommendation the re

pines has taken like vaccination.
It was made Monday night at the meet
ing of the Native Sons' and Native
Daughters' commit and yesterday
morning it whs on the tongue of every one
interested in the return of the volunteers.
"By all means,'' was the expression j
from every lip, "the Governor should
proclaim a holiday."
At the committee rooms of the Native j
Sons and Daughters in the California ,
Hotel, at the headquarters tent in Union
square Park, where the Red Cross ladies
will provide for the ease and comfort of
the soldier boys: a* the meeting places of
the various sub-committees of the citi
zens' reception committee, the same an
swer was given to the question.
"Favor it? Of course we do."
On the impulse of the moment many
gave it as their opinion that the holiday
should be that on which the boys set foot
again on their native shore. Others, who
took more time to determine, favored the
da*, following, for the very good reason
that by that time, after a good night's
si.ep. the boys would have had time to
get the cramps of shipboard out of their
limbs and be able to enjoy the good tilings
prepared for them. In addition, it was
urged: little could be â 'â â â â¢â  for the volun
teers on the day they landed other than
lunch them at the ferry, march them to
the Presidio in the afternoon and again
in the monster procession at night under
the- glow of thousands of incandescent
lamps.
On the day of the i ding, too, it is
urged few employers will insist on a full
day's work from their employes. Already
nuinv have announced their Intention of
making landing day a half holiday. Tins
will be sufficient to allow all to greet the
boys as they steam in. and then how
nicely will come next day with its legal
holiday aspect.
The holiday; of course, will be fixed by
the Governor, but he will certainly con
sult the wishes of the people who propose
it. These wishes will be put in official
form to-day at the conference committee,
and the result will be forwarded to the
Cwernor to reinforce the communication
ordered by the Native Sons ami Daugh
ters asking that he designate California
Volunteers' day.
Another thing that will take tip much
..ft:- attention 6f the conference com
mittee is the question of the time of the
big parade. It was the first intention of
the Native Sons and Daughters, who ini
tiated the movement for the reception,
that it should be held In the afternoon
a* Monday night's meeting they were ad
dressed by \V. J. Martin, W. P. Sullivan
Jr. and Henry McPlke of the citizens
committee, who sought to impress upon
them the advantages of a night parade
under the mass of electric lighting to be j
provided by the decoration committee.
The Native Sons and Daughters took
kindly to the suggestion and forthwith
appointed a committee to meet this morn
ing a like committee from the citizens'
organization. The plan was discussed yes
terday in an formal way. Grand Mar
shal Pistolesl and his assistants inter
viewed a largo umber of those represent
ing organizations that have signified a
willingness to parade and found a unani
mous sentiment in favor of the night
parade. In speaking last night of the
matter. Grand Marshal Pistoles! said:
"While the committee from the recep
tion committee appointed last night has
not yet had a formal meeting, yet the
individual sentiment of each member of
that committee is strongly in favor of the
night parade. It is almost Certain that
each member will go prepared to-morrow
morning to tell the executive committee
that the parade as suggested will be de
cided upon and that the Native Sons and
Daughters will bend all their ; energies to
make the affair a credit to both organiza
tions."
The primary election yesterday was not
allowed to disturb the even tenor of the
way of those interested in preparations
for the reception of the home-coming vol
unteers. Early in the morning dozens and
dozens of the collectors appointed by the
executive council of the nnanoe commit
tee started out books it. hand, to jot
down memoranda of descriptions to the
fund. On every hand they met wit 1 open
armed reception to judge from the flat
tering reports made at the sitting of the
council.
Everybody seems willing to contribute
something to the reception fund and be
fore the citizen collectors get through
everybody will have the opportunity. I*
is the programme now to have subscrip
tion agents in all the districts mapped out
not iter than this afternoon. By Satur
day night most of those who are to be
seen will have been seen.
The headquarters tent was the scene of
much activity during the day. Miss Jo
sephine Molloy. the newly appointed clerk,
was installed in her cosy quarters ready
to do a banking business; electric lights
ere being put in- and the interior be
ing decorated for the dedication in the
evening, which drew thousands of people.
The theatrical managers put in the day
adding the finishing touches to the pro
gramme for the big benefit and making
ready for the big social crush expected
at the Orpheum to-morrow at the auc
tion sale of boxes and choice seats, which
begins promptly at noon. No person who
pretends to be anybody can afford to miss
it. It will be a swell function and enter
tainment in itself that will rival the gen
eral run of theatrical performances and,
best of all, it costs nothing. The Mayor
and many of the beauties of the dramatic
profession will be on hand, a concert and
ait. merit will be given and Olograph
pictures of the soldiers in the trenches

The Headquarters Tent in Union Square

and repeated cheers for the returning

of the royal welcome that is yet to come.
Promptly at 8 o'clock the bursting of
a bomb announced the opening Â»1 the
tent In the name of the Citizens Execu
tive Committee, and soon after Master
of Ceremonies A. M. Lawrence welcomed
the people.
"Ladies and Gentlemen," he said, us
chairman of the committee in charge of
these headquarters, [-now declare this

intended, namely, -a home for the sol

which a grateful people stand ready to
bestow. The principal square of the city
has been appropriated for the comfort
and welfare of the soldiers, who may
here rind rest, refuge and the advice of
the ladies of the Red Cross, who will
minister to their wants. A bank has been
established where small deposits may be
left. The soldiers are able to defend their
country, -but are poorly equipped to de
tend themselves.
"I trust that you will all co-op rate in
making the undertaking a success. Let
each one see to it that the return of the i
soldiers is made glad and extend that i
hospitality for which I am proud lo say
our City is famed throughout the world."
In introducing Father Doherty. Mr. -j
Lawrence said: "The reverend gentleman
is fresh from the battlefields in the Phi:- j
ippines." Father Doherty said in part:
"This celebration we are about to give ,
Is only what we owe to them and to
ourselves, and is a debt of gratitude for
glorious deeds unflinchingly performed.
They have proved their invincible worth.
"They must not come back only to re
ceive empty woids of welcome after hav
ing sacrificed everything. Let our citizens
see to It that what happened to the sol
; filers who went to the Sacramento riots
does not happen to the boys of the First
California. Let them not come back and
find that their positions have been filled.
If republics are ungrateful, let it be shown
that the people are not. The sooner the
citizen-soldier becomes the soldier-citizen â¢
the better for him and his country."
Father Doherty then paid a tribute to
the Red Cross, which he said was com
posed of a noble band of American women
inn.. American soldiers, teaching them
to realize the dignity of their manhood
: and making their return glorious.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger was the next
speaker introduced by Mr. Lawrence, who
said that the first soldier to die in the war
was a Jew, a member of Company A.
"I, feel jealous of Father Doherty to
' night," said the rabbi, "for he appears be-
I fore this distinguished gathering with a j
war record. while 1 come In the borrowed .
plumes of the reception committee. I dis- I
! claim that we members of the church
come here as the representatives of any
particular religious sect. We are all en-
I rolled under the banner of patriotism.
Americanism is instrumental, Inasmuch
as there is only one gospel for those who
march to defend the country's honorâ the j
Stars and Stripes." *= ' _' .
When Mrs. Harrington was brought for- 1
â¢ward as the representative of the Red
Cross Society Rabbi Voorsanger cried out:
"The fairy godmother of th.> soldiers,"
and an outburst of applause followed the
clever sally. Â tf.
"This ten! as been erected, said Mrs.
Harrington, "to protect the soldiers all
â  along the line. We of the Red' Cross* So
ciety stand ready to furnish them food,
money if necessary and kind words, which
it is said they greatly need. We desire to
show that we will take care of ,the sol
diers to the best of our ability. But we
want more than words of cheer and en
couragement. Business men should put
i their hands very deep in their pockets and
j make the volunteers glad thai they went
to Manila." ... _ _ t>
Addresses were also delivered by Rev.
! William Kader. George A. Knight and
I Major Noble, who represented central
I Shafter. , _ _ _
Among the ladies of the Red Cross who
! attended the opening were Mrs. Hubbard,
. Mr-* Merrill. Mrs. Mills, Mrs. Elliott, Mrs.

' Mrs. Sanborn, Mrs. Scott and Mrs. O'Neill. :

BLACKMAILING HIGHBINDERS.
Posters Circulated by a Gang . De
manding Money From Passen
gers to China.
A blackmailing proposition of a gang
of highbinders, twelve in number, was
brought to the attention of Chief Lees
yesterday and the Chinatown squad has
been instructed to arrest any of the gang
on sight.
Posters have within the past day or two
been sent to every house and store in
Chinatown and have also been posted up
on the walls declaring that each Chinese
who intends to leave for China must pay
the gang $â¢* 50. If the money is not paid
the relatives and friends of the Chinese
will be held responsible and threats are
made that the consequences will be seri
ous.
By order of the Chief the posters were
torn from the walls yesterday and an ex
ample will be made of the highbinders if
caught.

CURED AS BY
A MIRACLE
Wonderful Case of Joseph Smith,
Who Gained 24 Pounds in Three
Weeks Under Dr. Aborn's
Treatment at 554 Sut-
ter Street.
In the treatment of chronic diseases of
the -tomach. liver, bladder and kidneys,
as well as of the eye, ear. head, throat
and lungs. Dr. Aborn of 554 Sutter street
Is a recognized authority. A remarkable
cure recently effected by him was brought
to the attention of a reporter a few days
ago. The patient was Joseph Smith,
whose statement Is given herewith in
full:
"J was for two rears sorely afflicted." said
Mr. Smith, "with an obstinate chronic disease
that completely broke down my health so that
i I had given up all hope of ever getting well.
I tried several doctors without any benefit. I
persevered under one doctor's treatment for a
! whole year without benefit. My stomach
liver, kidneys and bladder were affected and
life was a burden to me In this miserable con-
dition. In this seemingly hopeless state of
health I applied to Dr. Aborn just three weeks
ago and he has cured me as though by magic,
so speediiv and thoroughly has his treatment
acted in mv case. I roved from the nrst
day's treatment and I have gained just twenty-
four pounds in three weeks under Dr. Ab â¢â¢_â _*
modern system of treatment. I look and fÂ«-Â«
like a new man. I make this statment for th*
benefit of the afflicted, that they may know
Dr. Aborn effects speedy and permanent cures
after all others have failed. The facts I cheer-
: fully attest to under oath."
Dr Aborn's phenomenal success Is well
known on the American continent for the
past thirty years. Instantaneous relief
and permanent cures are often effected at
the first personal consultation, especially
in such cases as have for years or a life-
time resisted the ordinary modes of prac-
tice.

EASTERN MARKET& j
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. B.â The stock market was
a dull affair for the greater part of to-day,
drifting aimlassly within a narrow range.
Some strength was shown by a few isolated
stocks throughout the day under the influence
which was not disclosed by any published news.
This persistent strength in some spots seemed
to arouse the apprehension of the bears in the
last hour of the market. The manner in
which prices were marked up in the late deal
ings indicated a good deal of a scramble by
the shorts to cover their contracts and awak
ened more appearance of animation and
strength than has been seen in the market for
some time. The higher prices for Americans
maue in London were without much effect and
they were for the most part nominal, and
London sold from 12,000 to 15,000 shares here
aft the opening. Strength kept cropping at
new points as the day progressed. There was
early strength in Anaconda and a few of the
specialties, but a period of reaction followed
under realizing in Tobacco and Kansas City,
Pittsburg and Gulf. Then the Minneapolis and
St. Louis stocks rose 5% and 3*4 respectively.
There was a late movement in the coalers
which lilted them from 1 to 2%, with a not
able effect on the whole list. ; Other stocks
showing notable gains were Consolidated Gas.
4**4. and Pacific Coast second preferred, 2%;
Tennessee Coal, Colorado Fuel. People's Gas.
Brooklyn Transit, Steel and Wire, Linseed OH
preferred and a few less prominent stocks ad
vanced a point. A very strong upward move
ment In Sugar from 159% to 162*4 was the de
cisive Influence in the late strength of the
market, which closed active and strong at net
gains in nearly all cases. The ton,, of the .
money market was called rather easy, though
rates were not quotahly changed. Sterling ex
change here continued Its downward course and
confidence grew that gold will come from
abroad if an emergency here demands It.
The free offerings of funds from outside
sources In the New York money market In
creases the belle" that small demands will be
made upon New York fur money to move the
crops. There were late reports of weakness In
the London market for silver on account of
importations from Chile.
Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf first re
acted In sympathy with the stock. Otherwise
changes were small and mixed. Total sales,
par value $1,320,000.
United States bonds unchanged on bid quota
tion.

4 _ â â â Â«t>
I CHICAGO, August The opening prices for
September Wheat showed a decline of %@%c
from yesterday, September starting at 6S%@
68% c, and that proved to be the highest point
of the da>*. Interest In the market, which has
j been slack for several days, was, if possible, ;
even duller than yesterday, and the market
for th? greater part of the session kept within
a range of %c. The weakness at the start was
due to a decline at Liverpool of %d since Fri- j
day. This was double the decline in the local
market since that day and coupled with the j
, continued absence of foreign inquiry for Amer- ;
lean Wheat kept prices on the down grade
during most of the day. It was apparently I
the prevailing opinion that it was a hopeless
task to attempt to bull the market while there
is so little demand for Wheat abroad, ami
what little buying was done was against puts,
ito which price â 68%_68%c-fthe market de- i
clined shortly after the opening. There was
scattered selling by the northwest and by local
commission houses, but outside interest was
slack. September longs were Inclined to trans
fer their deals from that month to Decem
ber and buying of the latter against sales of
j September had a tendency to widen the spread
! between these months to the advantage of the
J carriers. September got down to 68% c. A
: slight!} better feeling developed near the close,
I shorts being fair buyers at the bottom and
j the market rallied slightly, closing at 68%Q
I 6S%c.
i Corn was fully as dull as Wheat, but much
! steadier. The market was weak at the start,
! but the strong cash situation sustained prices.
September closed a shade higher.
Oats were dull and irregular. The cash de
| mand was excellent and receipts were large.
' September closed a shade lower. May- closed
with an advance of %c.
Provisions were heavy throughout the ses
sion. Packers were free sellers, apparently on
i the belief In a freer hog movement and sub-
I stantial support was lacking. The market

The New York Commercial says: "Prunes
are quiet and spot trading Is not large. The
! carry-over promises to be larger than holders
i wish, hut still if the present rate of distribu
! tion continues there will be comparatively few
I In this market. On the coast some 300 cars
may be left, though probably this is an outside
estimate and may not be borne out by facts.
The growing crop appears to be in good con
dition so far as California is concerned, and
the output promises to be large. France re
ports not over 30,000,000 pounds, compared with |
90,000,000 two years ago. Oregon will not send
out over 300 cars, as against an anticipated
output of 1000 cars. The market should, there
fore, prove favorable for high prices on Cali
fornlas, and holders are looking forward to
brisk trade. --Â-s*.'':
"Peaches are quiet and held firmly up to
quotations. There are rumors of sales of sev
eral cars for forward delivery at private prices,
but no confirmation of the report is obtain
able. New crop will not be along until next
month or toward the last of this. Quotations
are around 6%c for future delivery, and holders
show no disposition to shade the figures.
"Apricots continue steady, with sales at
9@9%a Buyers appear to be certain that a
decline ' will follow the present strong situa- i
tion, but holders are apparently equally cer
tain that quotations will hold stiff at present
rates. There is little business as a result of
the divergence of views, and no one can tell
when the deadlock will lie broken.
"Raisins attract some more attention than
they did last week at this time, but sales -are
! now rather more quiet. Seedlings and ungraded
I varieties are in most demand, and are held
j firm. The outlook for business is encouraging.
i and good sales are expected. Reports concern-
I ing damage to the growing crop are vague,
and as yet do not exert much influence. If
there is any loss well informed dealers here
say that it will be largely on first crop. The
second crop will probably be safe and quite
I up to expectations."

Since the Mariposa left, the following Aus
tralian coal cargoes were delivered here, viz..
Earl of Dunmore, 3575 tons; Carrollton, 2131
tons; Invercoe, 2347 tons; total. 8253 tons. The
total arrivals here of Colonial coal since June 1
up to date only foot up 27.278 tons, whereas In
the same period last year the arrivals amounted
to 60,279 tons. This is very singular, as our crops
J this year were declared better than the average
" five months ago, which would naturally have
headed tonnage in this direction, whereas m
IS9B at the same time our harvest was a pro
nounced failure. This clearly demonstrates
that there is an unprecedented demand for ton
nage everywhere, and we are now feeling Its
effects locally. The total coal tonnage listed
for here from Newcastle and Sydney foots up
about 72,000 tons; last year in August it was
over 90,000 tons. Last freight quotations from
Newcastle are quoted at 16s to 16s 6d per ton
for prompt loading.
Coal quotations are established now entirely
by the Coast Colliery Agents, as the small
quantity of foreign coming to hand cuts a very
small figure in making prices. No material ad
vance has been made, but the market Is steady
and later on better prices may be looked for,
as coast tonnage is so scarce it will be a task
to keep our local requirements fully supplied.
There will shortly be some steam colliers added
to our carrying fleet.

j receipts at this port thus far this year at
157,788 bags, against 114.427 during the same,
! time last year. The sales from flrst hands
; were 105. bags, against 82,836. The stock;
'â  in first hands August 1 was 50,939 bags, against
30,789. The world's visible supply August 1
was 6,769,000 bags, against 5,701,422. The cir
cular says:
"A glance at the sales since our issue of
the 7th ultimo, shows the past month to have
been one of unusually large business for this
season. Grades below 8c have found readiest
sale and the continued demand for these makes
the one steai y feature of the market.
"Unwashed Salvadors have dragged, while
washed varieties are attracting attention be
cause of the values they show as compared
with other growths.
"All Coffees over 10c evoke but little Interest
I and keep sagging toward a point more in
' harmony with the lower priced goods and,
j while Brazil receipts continue as at present,

YOUNG WIFE
FINDS SHE IS
NUMBER TWO
Husband Has Eloped
With a Third.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Aug. 8.
A dainty little woman not over 20 years
if age told a story in the District Attor
ney's office this afternoon that uncovers
remarkable duplicity in a man not much
older than herself.
Mrs. Rosie Wolf was married in Sacra
mento just a year ago. and now she has
made the discovery that her husband is a
bigamist and that she has no legal claim
to the name of the man who is now living
with a third young lady at Tcsia and go
ing hy the name of Charles Eeiter.
Some time after her marriage to Wolf
Mrs. Rosie Wolf detected certain discrep
ancies in her husband's account of his
past thai led her to believe that another
Mrs. Wolf was living somewhere in the
Kast. She employed a detective, to whom
she confided her suspicions, and a few
weeks ago she received a letter from the
first Mrs. Wolf, stating that Wolf had
deserted her and three children some time
ago and had also taken with him the pro
ceeds of a house and lot which, he had
sold and which was their joint property.
Immediately on receiving this Informa
tion young Mrs. Wolf, who was then re
siding at Emeryville, told him of her dis
covery and at once left his home, return
ing to her parents in San Francisco. Wolf
made no attempt to deny the existence of
MRS. ROSIE WOLF AND HER FALSE HUSBAND
his first wife nd family, but sought to ,
effect a compromise with his second wife j
â which would prevent him from having to j
meet the consequences of committing big
amy. Several meetings were held between j
Wolf, his second wife nd her parents
at the oflice of Attorney Mitchell, ann
Wolf agreed to contribute $12 a month to
the support ot his second wife and gave
her an order on the Judson Iron Works,
â¢whore he had a good position, to draw her
allowance.
As the end of the first month ap- -
preached Mrs. Wolf went to the iron I
works, only tv be informed that Wolf had
loft his position and had drawn his pay .
up to the time of leaving.
After leaving the iron works Wolf was
lost sight of for several days. He had j
"disappear. . About ti e same time it j
was learned that a little divorcee. Mattie
Tvrer 19 years old. had also mysteriously
disappeared from her home in Golden
Gate. Mrs. Tvrer left a brief note with
her parents, the Atwoods, stating that
she ha secured a good position but cou d
hot them until later .... she would
be located. Wolf and Mrs. Tyrer had been
frequently seen in each other's company
and it was a , nee c included that the
bigamist had eloped with the missing Kir,
This presumption proved to be **"'-'*â¢ j
and the- couple were found at the lesia
coal mines, where they were living under
the name of Loiter. As soon as Mrs.
Tyrer realized what she had done she
wrote to her parents asking their forgive
ness and declaring that she was perfectly
contented with Wolf, who had promised
to marry her as soon as he could secure
a divorce from his wife in Oakland.
When Mrs. Wolf No. 2 read or the
elopement to Tesla she decided that her
husband was deserving of the full pen
alty of the law and that it was evidently
a practice of his to lead young women j
astray under the pretext of marriage.
She held an agreement with him In
which he over his signature admitted ,
many violations of his vows even during
the ten months she lived with him a. his j
wife She had promised to allow all the
unpleasantness to drop if he would keep
his promise to pay her alimony. After
her detention and the flight to le.sla she
informed Wolfs attorney that ah ifcree- j
ments were eff and that she would at
once swear to a warrant charging him j
with bigamy. Wolf and Mrs. Tyrer's ;
Barents correspond with, each other and
he parents are heartbroken over the af
fair Recently the- received a join: let
ter from Tesla, in which Mattle lis ol
her happy life with Wolf, and Wolf as-.
sure* her parents that they need not
fear for their daughter's welfare so long.
as she intrusts it to him. Mrs. Wclf No.
2 has also consulted with Matties parents .
and they assure her that they have done
all in their power to Induce their daugh
ter to come home and live down the' no
toriety of her escapade, but to no pur-
The letters to the second Mrs. Wolf
from the wife in the East tell of five
years of married !!fe in which there was
very little happiness. Much bitterness is
expressed toward the heartless hutband
and father, and also the desire that the j
=eoond wife will see thai Wolf reaps the
lust deserts of his faithlessness Tt is
a matter of much surprise to Wolfs
friends that he should have run off with
Ma tti-- Tvrer. who Is well known In j
Emeryville* and who is a far less attract
ive young woman than his second wife.
"I was only a year younger than now
when T married Wolf," paid his second
wife "but I have learned more in that
year than In all the rest of mv life.
Wolf is one of the most pleasant and i
smoothest men it is possible to meet. He
is fond of talking and given not a little
to boasting, and I presume that while
outside of home at Emeryville he must I
have boasted of his successes in indue-;
ing women to marry him. for otherwise i
I should hardly have heard of the exist
ence of his first wife. We have corre
sponded regularly and T now understand
the situation thoroughly. I shall press !
this matter and really hope that he will
},(. severely punished, for lie has not only
wrecked my life at the outset, but Is i
now helping to disgrace the woman
with whom he is living at Tesla.
"As soon as I heard that I was not his
wife T left him Immediately, but I thought
enough of him not to have wished to
send him to jail until he ran off with
that. girl. Had he straightened out his I
difficulties with his first wife in a legal
manner I do not know but that I might ;
have been persuaded to return to him, |
bill ho has* shown himself to be such :
a coward that all mv feelings for him >.
have changed to contempt,"
In addition to swearing to a complaint
for bigamy, Mrs. Wolf will also petition
t<- have her marriage set aside on the ;
ground that at the time of the ceremony
Wolf had a wife living. tf

JAKEY WAS
TOO FREE IN
HIS SPEECH
His Confession May
Be Damaging.
Oakland Oflice San Francisco Call,
' 90S Broadway. Aug 8.
The prize-fighters and the lovers of
sport who sacrificed a quarter apiece to
witness the recent basement mill ap
peared before Judge Smith this morning
with a small army of attorneys. After
a little conference It was agreed to have
sill the spectators represented by Attor
neys Colonel Garrity and Lin church.
Dr. Leroy Herrick and Will Tye were
called, but were not present, and Colonel
Garrity; for the missing defendants, said
they would be ready to explain their
presence in the basement to-morrow
morning, and a continuance was granted.
In addition to these cases Joe Rosenberg,
.1. S. Richardson, Fred Gatter, J. D. Eel
kins. Will Holland, Phil Simon and James
Galligan also had their cases passed till
to-morrow, when they will -.had.
George Duddy pleaded not guilty, and
said he wanted to be tried by the court
when he was a little less busy, and he
will be accommodated next Monday. Tom
Brady also wanted a separate trial and
will have it next Tuesday.
The situation is a little mixed. Green
and Permien, two young dad.- who acted
as bottle-holders, have pleaded guilty,
and will be sentenced to-morrow. Their
pleas will naturally affect the cases
against the spectators, who will hard
be able to prove that they were at the
ringside of the prize-fight and were not
looking on. Jakey Baumgarten, one of
the principals, made such a full con
fession that 'hi. Hodgkins is confident
of securing convictions. Jake was taken
from his bed at a quarter to 3 in the
morning. and shivering and scan he
went before Captain Peterson, who read
to him that section of the Penal Code re
lating to prize-fighting and Its penalties.
Jake was duly informed that anything
he might say might possibly be used
against him nt his trial, but between his
tears he told all hi knew, and thereby
lost many of his friends. Jake's con
fession is as full as though he realized
that by giving it he could prevent his
going to San Quentin for the five yearÂ«
which the law fixes as a maximum pen
alty for just such cases. With Jake con
fessing he was actually fighting for a
prize and without a permit, and with the
bottle-holders having pleaded guilty, the
alleged spectators will have to prove that
they were somewhere else at the time, or
else put up a novel defense.
Many are denying that they were pres
ent. Tin- arresting of the spectators is
still going on. and In addition to the
twelve landed yesterday William Hugh,
H. E. Alden. a real estate man, and
Charles Bock, a newspaper man. were
gathered In to-day, and many others have
promised to surrender themselves as soon
as they can procure the necessary $J0
with which to furnish bail. It now looks
as though that miserable fight in the
basement will net the city treasury about
$."iOO. while the value of the stake was
$9 20.
Libel Case Seeking a Judge.
OAF-LAND, Aug. Apparently neither
Judges Greene. Ogden nor Ellsworth is
particularly willing to try the $100,000 libel
suit brought by W. J. Dingee against Mrs.
Pedar Sather. The case came up origin
ally before Judge Ogden and he trans
ferred it to Judge Ellsworth's department,
but the latter transferred it back to the
former, who then sent it to Judge
Greene's department, and Judge Greene
yesterday transferred it back to Judge
Ellsworth. To-day Judge Ellsworth
promptly sent the case back to Judge
Greene. The Judges seem adverse to
handling the case,

THE SAN If KAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. AUGUST 9, 1899.
NETTIE SPEARS
TURNS TABLES
ON HER SPOUSE
He Sued Her for a
Divorce.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 8.
Morgan C. Spears, who only a few days
ago filed a sensational divorce suit in the
Superior Court of Alameda County against
bis wife. Nettie J. Spears, picturing her in
his allegations as an amazo'nlan who on
one occasion ordered lam at the point of
a revolver to quit the family home at
Sanger, Fresno County, lias had the tables
turned on him. He has been arrested on
a warrant issued in Sanger charging him
with failure to provide for his rive minor
children.
Spears Is a motorrnan in the employ of
the Oakland Transit Company, and Dep
uty Constable Irvie, who came all the
way from Sanger to effect the arrest, had
little difficulty In finding the man in blue
uniform and brass buttons. Spears was
decidedly surprised when placed under ar
rest, but through the pro: 1 1 > t action of
his attorneys. Goodcell & Mendenhall. who
rustled up bondsmen, he was later in the
day released by Superior Judge Ogden on
$600 bonds. Mr. and Mrs. Ben Wright go
ing his sponsors. He was held to answer
before the magistrate In Fresno County.
Though Spears, in his divorce complaint
made many charges of extreme cruelty,
explaining that he had left his wife rear
ing that his life would be endangered if lie
returned, Mrs. Spear, on the other hand,
will have a sad story of non-support to
relate when the case comes on for trial.
Recently she had the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children intercede
for her and go on her deserting spouse's
trail.
Another interesting divorce suit was
filed to-day by Alexander Anderson, an
engineer by occupation, who in his com
plaint, prepared by Attorney H. S. Aid
rich alleges that his wife, Lizzie Ander
son, has deserted him. He not only
charges that the wife deserted ins bed and
board, but that she took the bed and most
of the other household furniture along
with her when she left. The parties were
married about a year ago and this is not
Anderson's first experience In divorce pro
ceedings. He was also divorced from his
two former wives, both Of whom. It is
said left him under circumstances very
similar to those Involved In the present
case. __
Ben J. V. Merle, a motorrnan on the
Alameda Electric line, . also commenced
proceedings to-day for a divorce from
Florence R. Merle*. Me. too. alleges that
his wife left him without provocation.
MUST CARRY LIGHTS.
Baby Carriages Not Exempt From
the Ordinance.
ALAMEDA, Aug. B.â The Board of City
i Trustees adopted an ordinance last night.
! under the provisions of which it will be
j necessary for any person propelling a
j baby carriage after nightfall to carry a
â¢ light. The ordinance is general in its
! scope and includes automobiles, hay wag-
I ons. bicycles, tricycles or vehicles of any
! kind. The ordinance as adopted is as
| follows:
1 Section 1. No person shall use or ride
upon any conveyance, bicycle, tricycle
or other vehicle on any public street
f or way in the city of Alameda after 8
o'clock in the evening or before sun
rise of any day between April 1 and
October 1 of any year, or after 6
o'clock in the evening and before sun
rise of any day betwen October 1 and
April 1 of any year, unless such con
veyance, bicycle, tricycle or other ve
hicle is provided with a light of at
hast one-candle power, projecting
rays of light In the direction In which
said vehicle is moving.
Sec. 2. Any person who shall violate
any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall be deemed guilty of a misde
i meanor, and upon conviction thereof
shall be punished by a fine not exceed
ing $20. or by imprisonment in the
! City Jail of th.- city of Alameda, Cal.,
for a term not exceeding ten days, or
by both such fine and imprisonment.
Sec. 3. Ordinance 212 is hereby re
pealed.
Sec. 4. This ordinance shall be pub
lished In the official paper of this
, city and take effect immediately there
after.
The above ordinance is to take the place
of one making it a misdemeanor for any
j person to ride a bicycle, etc., on the
| streets of Alameda after dark.
I The attention of the board was called by
1 the City Attorney to the unjustness of
i the ordinance to bicyclists, who were re
j quired to carry lights, while other ye
! hides were exempt, whereupon the board
I instructed him to prepare an ordinance to
i include all vehicles.
The merchants are displeased at the
board for passing such an ordinance.

THE TWIN HEROES
OF TWIN LAKES
OAKLAND, Aug. S. âH. .T. and A. R. Waters of Nil*B, proprietors of the
Herald, are heroes. They have made a record as life-savers at Twin
Lakes that will never be' forgotten so long as Baptist conventions are
held in the little resort near Santa Cruz.
Early last Sunday morning a party of young ladles and gentlemen,
consisting of Miss May Vernon and Miss Florence Page of East Oakland, G.
R. and W. C. Pruett of Oakland and A. It. and 11. G. Waters of Niles, left
Twin Lakes for the beach, having an engagement to breakfast at the Hotel
Capitola. They were Inspecting a cove and were hemmed in by a forty-foot
precipice. They were of the opinion that the tide was going out, but instead
it was coming in. After walking far into the cove they discovered their mis
take. There was nothing but steep precipices ahead of them, and their only
chance of .-scape was by the way they had gone In. The water was rapidly
deepening, and to get out they would have to brave the surf.
To save the young ladies they must be carried on the shoulders of the
gentlemen. This was a comparatively easy matter around the first two
points. The Waters brothers, being the larger of the men. bore the young la
dies, the Pruett brothers leading the way. Rut when the third point was
reached the surf was high and getting dangerously rough, and here was the
test of valor.
H. J. "Waters, the Pruett brothers leading and guiding him slowly through
the water, carried Miss Vernon around the point tirst. He then returned to
assist his brother and carried Miss Page out, A. U. Waters guiding. The task
was a severe one physically, but was accomplished with no dreaded results.
The last point was easily made, each of the Waters brothers carrying a
young lady through the surf, which was here shallow. When the party turned
about from their point of safety and looked hack at the beach just traveled
they saw that the coves were full and that the surf was angrily breaking over
tin- points. Cheers reached their ears from a bevy of anxious people on the
wharf as they came into plain sight, for they had been watched in their peril
and some fishermen asked to go to their rescue.
Word was sent to the relatives of the young ladles that they were safe,
for it was feared that th.- story of their danger would precede their return.

TRIAL OF IMPORTANT
SUIT IS COMMENCED
LARSEN SEEKS DAMAGES FOR
WRECKED HOME.
Awful Details of the Melrose Ex
plosion Will Be Recited Again
in Court.
_
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9 8 Broadway, Aug. 8.
An important trial was commenced in
Judge Ogden's court this afternoon. The
case is that of Rasmus Larsen, who is
suing the Western Fuse and Explosives
Company for $1500 on account of the
wrecking of his home at Melrose by the
explosion which coat the lives of six
brave officers a year ago, and for the
next few days the awful details ol the j
explosion will be recited in court once j
more. : - â' ... .. ,
The Larsen suit is the first of the kind
to reach trial, and upon its ultimate out- j
come will depend the action to be taken
by many other property owners who sui- j
fered losses. Should Larsen win and the
company be held responsible, any num
ber of suits will be promptly filed. Th-;
particular point at issue is whether or
not the powder magazines maintained at
Melrose, and which were set off by a
murderous Chinese who was trying to
avoid capture, were really nuisances.
The greater part of this afternoon was
occupied in securing a jury. The ilaintitf
Is represented by Attorneys M. C. > hap
man and Reed & Nusbaumer, while
George R. Lukens is watching the com
pany- Interests.
REHEARSING FOR THE
CAKEWALK CARNIVAL
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â From present In
dications the great International Cake
walk Carnival will be all that the man
agement expects it to be, and when the
doors will be thrown open next Wednes
day evening, August 16, a large and en
thusiastic audience Is expected. Every
preparation Is being made, rehearsals are
being held daily, and the grand entry and ,
pageant, with several hundred hand
somely costumed cakewalkers, together
with many beautiful floats, which add
very materially to the beauty of the
spectacle, will be wonderfully attractive.
Th. procession will be led by Miss Peari
Hickman, who, by the way, is the Very
personification of grace and a decided
master in the art of dancing, and Imme
diately behind her will be the retinue of
the king and queen of the carnival fol
lowed by his and her highnesses, seated
in a gorgeous chariot, which is being
built for the occasion. Then will follow
the numerous cakewalkers in their differ
ent divisions ranging from the graceful
and dignified cakewalk to the grotesque
style of walking. There will also be two j
handsomely decorated floats representing
the "Birth of the Cakewalk" and the i
"Cakewalk Up to Date."
One of the most unique features of the ,
carnival, without a doubt, will be the
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE
DEWEY HOME FUND
Enough Money Has Already Been
Raised to Purchase a Home,
but More Is Wanted.
WASHINGTON, Aug. B.â The Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Vanderllp.
chairman of the National Dewey Home
Fund Committee, said to-day in regard to
the Dewey home:
"The committee is very much encour
aged with the returns which are being
made. The total receipts now exceed $20,
--000, and even if no larger sum is realized
It is the purpose of the committee to pur
chase a home with that amount, it is
expected, however, that the fund will
grow considerably owing to the fact that
the admiral has not raised any objections
to receiving the gift. Many people who
were anxious to contribute held aloof
from the project owing to the circulation
of rumors that the admiral would not ac
cept the home extended him. But it .s
expected that the removal of this obsta
cle will induce many to contribute who
were stopped by the circulation of false
reports The whole business will be closed
before the arrival of Admiral Dewey, It
is now expected that he will arrive Sep
tember 1 instead of October 1. During
the next month 1 hope contributions will
come in rapidly and liberally. There
ought not to be near so much difficulty In
raising $40,000 or (50.000 throughout the
whole country when for the purpose of
giving the admiral a reception in New
York three or four times that amount has
been received and expended to make the
celebration a very prominent one.
"The home fund movement ls a project
which every section of the country should
have at heart. The hon is to be located
at the national capital. While this is a
long w-v from the Pacific States, yet they
are Indebted to the hero of Manila per
haps a little more, because of the fact
that they are nearer to the scene of his
glorious victory.
"It is highly probable that the commit
tee will decide to buy a house in the city
and remodel it. as no plans have been
called for as yet. The cause is a good one
Berkeley, Fruit vale

Miss La Salle and Mr. Barr, who were

being made expressly for the occasion.
CAUGHT A SHOPLIFTER,
BUT THEY LET HER GO
... . .
OAKLAND, Aug. B.â Through the keen
observation of Floor Walker Gantz at tile
Lace House a clever shoplifter was neatly
captured this morning. Gantz spied her
secreting a costly piece of lace beneath
her coat. She is supposed to be a Mrs.
Cowan, residing at Frultvale, and when
Mr. Gantz openly accused her she at first
denied it, but eventually her guilt was
left no longer in doubt, for she broke into
! tears and plteously pleaded for mercy.
! When sin- unbuttoned her coat tidies,
handkerchiefs, ribbons and two white
lawn dresses fell to th.- floor to corrobor
ate, her guilt. Some of the goods had been
tak-Ti from Salinger's and other stores
and In all the stolen property amounted
in value to about $17.".. She also had a
commutation ticket to San Francisco. Out
the owner's name had been effaced. There
was no Inclination, however, on the part
of Manager Capwell of the Lace House
to hold the woman, so he did not turn her
over to the police.
Death of a Pioneer Resident.
ALAMEDA. Aug. B.â William Holts, one
of the oldest and best known citizens of
the West End, died early this morning at
the Alameda Sanitarium. He recently suf
fered a stroke of paralysis, from the ef
fects of which he never recovered.
Deceased was born in Hamburg sixty
nine years ago. He came to California in
181!* and engaged in the grocery business
in San Francisco. In 1869 he located In
Alameda and opened a grocery .--tore on
the corner of Santa Clara avenue ;nd
what is now known as Linden street. A
few years later he embarked in the read
estate and insurance business, which vo
cation he followed up to the time of his
last illness.
Mr. Holtz was twice elected a Justice
of the Peace He was an old fireman, be
ing a charter member of Whidden Hose
Company No. 2, and was at one time a
member" of the Board of Education. __c
was f* member of Oak Grove Lodge. F.
and A. M.. under whose auspices the fu
neral will be conducted.
Deceased leaves a widow and an only
daughter. Mrs. Johanna Jurgens. who is
now visiting In Hamburg with the family
of her father's brother. Fred Holtz, the
only son, died In 1889.
Board of Trade Organized.
OAKLAND, Aug. S.â Permanent organi
zation of the Haywards Board of Trade
was effected at an enthusiastic meeting
of Haywards merchants last night by the
election of the following officers: H. E.
Bruner, president; George Oakes and T.
Wllbert. vice presidents; A. V. Morgan,
recording secretary; J. W. McCoy, finan
cial secretary; D. Chisholm, treasurer.
Tin- board of directors will be chosen at
a meeting to be held next Wednesday
night.
j and should have the sincere and earnest
co-operation of every true American. It
I is to oe hoped that, now that the great
I obstacle In the way of si ccess of the
| project, the refusal of the admiral to ac
cept the home, has been removed, the peo
ple of the country who were anxious to
: contribute will come to the fore *\ .th gen
; erous contributions."
While the committee has not given out
I any list of the contributions or the names
of those who have contributed, it is said
! that a good many of the most prominent
I men and women of the country are among
the number.
COLONIST RATES FIXED.
Transcontinental Roads Agree Upon
a Schedule.
CHICAGO, Aug. B.â All the Western
and transcontinental roads were repre
sented at the mass meeting at. the Great
Northern to-day to consider the proposi
tion to advance colonist rates to Califor
nia points regardless of the low rates in
effect to North Pacific Coast points. The
main obstacle in the way of a restoration
of the California rates was the fear that
the low North Pacific Coast rates might
be used as basing rates and thereby cut
California rates via North Pacific Coast
points
This obstacle was removed by the prom
ise of Passenger Agent Whitney of the
Great Northern that the low colonist
rates from St. Paul to North Pacific
Coast points would be limited strictly to
those points and would not be permitted
to be used as a basing rate. It was then
agreed to restore the California colonist
rates on September 1 to â  the old basis
of $52 60.
NO JOINT COMMISSION.
LONDON, Aug. 9.â The Daily Mail pub
i lishes the following dispatch from Johan
! nesburg: "By a special article added to
j the grondwe (the constitution of the
â  Transvaal) the President is authorised, la
the event of war, rebellion or other emer
gency, to proclaim martial law and to
compel every Inhabitant of the republic
to bear arms In its defense. The Pre
toria forts are being strengthened and
Boer agents are buying up all the avail
able draught oxen in Bechuanaland."
LIVERMORE IS
OUT FOR MEN
IN UNIFORMS
Wants a Company of
Guardsmen.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
808 Broadway, Aug. S.
Livermore is ambitious to furnish a per
manent company of the National Guard
of California. Many months ago a peti
tion was filed with the State authorities
asking that of the new companies to be
formed one be located In Livermore. The
petition was signed by fully twice the
number of eligible young men necessary
to form a company. , It is understood that
shortly the Board of Location will decide
where the new companies shall be placed.
1 There are three vacancies, one of which
was made by the dropping out of the Red
ding company, and the other two are in
the southern part of the State.
The Board of Location has the Liver
more petition In hand, and the only other
competitor for the honor, so far as known,
is Watsonville. The towns are using all
the influence they can command to gain
favorable action by the Board of Loca
tion, each town realizing that the adver
tisement that must follow from the forma
tion of a company is of Inestimable value.
The movement at Livermore was orig
inated by Dr. Summers, and his efforts
have been seconded by those of Assembly
men W. McDonald and J. O. McKown. It
is now propose. to Inaugurate a move
ment embracing the whole town, and to
try to bring the matter to a head at once.
The State is very generous in its allow
ances to National Guard companies, and
furnishes $1200 a year for the rent of an
armory, in addition to other money for
Incidentals. The only thing exacted of the
community Anally selected by the Board
of Location is that it shall be able to sus
tain a company. On this point it will be
an easy matter for Livermore to satisfy
the board, as there are at least three
times the necessary number of eligible
recruits in the town.
Mrs. Hildenbrand 's Estate.
OAKLAND. Aug. B.â Fritz Boehmer of
Alameda applied to-day for letters of ad
ministration on the estate of Margaretha
1* Hildenbrand, who died at the Napa In
sane Asylum on July 20. Her death was
attributed to the shock following a lucid
interval during which she realized her
sad position. The estate is very small,
consisting solely of two lots in Alameda
worth about $400. The heirs a son and
two daughters, are Conrad Hildenbrand,
aged P0 years; Mary E. Boehmer, aged 47,
and Louisa T. Graff, aged 30.

1 War Panorama
I Is one of the war books which is likely
'to be in continuous demand. It is a
: panoramic record of the triumphs of
Yankee Doodle. The eagle flaps his
wings on every page, and "Old Glory"
waves around and above every scene.
Prominent officers connected with the
i war are here portrayed, as well as
! many of the "men behind the guns."
i Military life is pictured to the eye, from
! recruiting to guard mount and skirmish
I line. Nor is the ludicrous omitted. Tha
j company cook receives the attention
J due to his importance; the mess is
; shown; cavalry scenes are given; the
j hospital arrangements are depicted; the
i heroines of the Red Cross service are
! displayed; street scenes in Havana,
> Santiago and elsewhere are unrolled,
' the new citizens or subjects (which are
I they?) of Uncle Sam appear and dis-
: appear as the leaves are turned.
In a word, the gazer visits the new
localities and sees the tumultuous new
- life, without the risk or expense of a
sea' voyage. â¢

DOWNFALL OF THE POLITICAL BOSS
CAUSED BY THE NEW PRIMARY LAW
Republican Campaign to
Be Guided by Best
Element.
Complete Routing of the Self-
Constituted Party
Managers.
C=r- __*, IIIRTY-THRF.E THOUSAND
votes were cast at the primary
election yesterday and the peo-
I pie achieved a triumph over
*-*-" the political bosses. The over
whelming defeat of the regular organi
zation of the Republican party and the
sweeping victory won by the Central
Republican League signify that the
Republicans of San Francisco will not
take orders from saloon bossesâ they
â will not go i" the barrooms for political
guidance and inspiration.
The Republican bosses, Kelly and
Crimmins, sot what they deserved. At
Sacramento last winter, when the
manly, honest and fearless Republi
cans were making the greatest fight in
the history of California to preserve
the honor of the State in the United
States .-"rial.'. Kelly ami Crimmins
cast what little influence they pos
sessed to aid Burns and the railroad.
They have been relegated to political
obscurity where they may keep com
pany with the Mexican. Thedeath knell
of Bosses Crimmins and Kelly was
sounded when The Call defeated the
blanket ticket scheme.
At the headquarters of the Kelly-
Crimmins forces defeat was acknowl
edged early in the evening. An atmos
phere of gloom and lonesomeness settled
over the place and hardly a visitor called
to share the sorrow of the few faith
ful lieutenants who remained on guard
and hoped against hope that the bad
news that had been coming in over the
telephone since the polls closed might
be without foundation and that in the
end the lightning would strike them.
They admitted that they had been de
lea led, howeverâ hopeless, defeated.
They did not know in what districts the
punishment had been most severeâ
that did not seem to worry them. It
was sufficient for them to know that
they were no longer "'in it."
In marked contrast was the situation
at the Grand Hotel rendezvous. The
luums were crowded, figures were dis
played on the walls and congratula
tions were in order. As â¢ early as 9
o'clock the Central Republicans had re
turns showing that they had won out
in the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth
and Forty-second districts, while the
Crimmins forces conceded them
the Thirty-seventh and Forty-first.
The only unsatisfactory news was that
Kellv and Crimmins had carried the
Twenty-ninth district by the narrow
margin of three votes.
"A glorious victory for honest poli
tics" was the cry of the winners. They
gave all the credit to the decent ele
ment of the voters of the city and
claimed none for 'themselves.
The result of the election is looked
upon as a blessing to the real Repub
lican party. It means that the County
Committee, which will in future guide
the destinies of the organization, will
have a higher and more laudable object
than controlling the spoils of office. If
the convention is equal to the occasion
and nominates representative men
there is little question but that the vic
tory at the next municipal election will
be as sweeping as the uprising of yes
terday against bossism.
The reform Democrats, under the
leadership of Gavin McNab and Jasper
Donald, have won a victory over
the boss forces which were marshaled
by Buckley, Rainev and the Examiner.
Boss Buckley made a desperate fight
to gain control of the convention, but

snr^HE new primary law has proven the undoing of the political boss and the safeguard of.
7-MIE new primary laze has proven the undoing of the political boss and the safeguard of
decent citizens.
/ The defeat of the blanket ticket proposition by The Call was the beginning of the end of
boss rule, and the working of the primary law was the climax.
Reputable members of the Republican party had an opportunity yesterday to express their
will without- fear of having that expression nullified by the machinations of the bosses who make
their headquarters in saloons, and the result is that the convention will be in the hands of the best
clement of the party and the ticket which will be put forth by the Republican party will not bear the
taint of either corruption or bossism, but will be made up entirely of men selected by those who have
the best interests of the city at heart, and will be carried forward to overwhelming victory 'at the
polls.
Not only will the ticket be a clean one, but the men who will have charge of the party affairs for
the coming year will be selected by the same convention, and the people of San Francisco will be
treated to a campaign conducted on clean lines with but one end in view â good of the whole
city. Boss domination in the party has been relegated to oblivion, and the tax-eaters must now give
place to officials who will administer the city's affairs in a business way.
In the Democratic ranks it was a triangular fight between bosses and the Committee of One
Hundredâ self -constituted manager of affairs Democraticâ out against Boss Buckley on
one corner and the Rainey-Examiner boss on the other, leaving so much of bitterness that factional
lights will mar the serenity of local Democracy and help reputable citizens to gain the ascendency in
the management of the city's business through the clean ticket which -will be presented by the Repub
licans.
For these benefits the new primary law is accountable, and its present trial has shown con
clusively that the honest citizen â the reputable citizen, the decent citizen repudiated in most un
mistakable manner the domination of the "boss" in politics.
was defeated at every point. The
Rainey-Examiner league fought with
equal desperation to down the Commit
tee of One Hundred, but the political
sagacity displayed by Gavin McNab
was too much for the fat boss and his
newspaper ally.
In the Twenty-eighth Assembly dis
trict the Rainey and Committee of One
Hundred ticket, headed by J. D. Max
well, is elected: The independent ticket,
headed by Frank Sweeney, and the
Buckley ticket, headed by David
Bridgewood, are defeated.
The fight in the Twenty-ninth Dis
trict was close. Early returns gave
the victory to the combined forces of
Rainey and Buckley, but at a late
hour the claim was put forward, based
on the tally of the ballots, that the
Braunhart ticket, backed by the Com
mittee of One Hundred, would pull
through. Braunhart up to midnight
admitted defeat, but after that hour
said there was some slight hope of his
success.
One of the most interesting and ex
citing battles of the day was carried
on in the Thirtieth District between
the Buckley forces headed by Alec
Greggains and the Rainey-Phelan
combination under the leadership of
Assistant Chief Dougherty. The Thir
tieth was almost conceded to Greg
gains during the early part of the day,
but Dougherty's men made a bitter
battle and finally won the day. The
Dougherty-Greggains political feud
has become a historical event in the
Thirtieth. Years ago they did politics
together, but when Greggains left the
Fire Department he organized his
forces and opposed Dougherty in sev
eral primaries. Dougherty's sweeping
victory possibly ends the bitter fac
tional warfare which has existed in
the district for many years.
In the Thirty-first District a bitter
battle was waged between the inde
pendent forces of Tim Treacy and the

Committee of One Hundred's ticket, j
headed by J. N. Renault. At midnight i
both factions claimed the victory. The |
Renault ticket placed its majority at j
eighty votes.
In the Thirty-second District the
Committee of One Hundred is the win
ner. The same committee ticket wins
in the Thirty-third, Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-ninth districts.
In the Fortieth District is a bitter
fight between two factions of the Com
mittee of One Hundred. Hassett leads
one faction and Rock 'the other. Re
turns-indicate the success of the Has
sett faction, although E. P. Troy and
W. H. Byington are, on the Rock ticket.
Democrats who are on the Inside as
sert that Phelan's Influence caused
many Republicans in this strong Re
publican district to get in the fight be
hind the Hassett faction.
The Committee of One Hundred elects
the delegates in the Forty-first District,
defeating Rainey and Buckley. The
committee also wins in the Forty-sec
ond and Forty-fifth districts.
While the bosses, Rainey and Lani
gan, may control a block of delegates
in the Democratic Convention the Com
mittee of One Hundred's following ex
ceeds the combined strength of the
bosses.
At the Buckley headquarters, after
the result- was announced, what few
members were present wore a look of
disappointment. Representatives of the
different districts agreed that they had
had an even fight and that the silent
vote had done the work.
Buckley, ln sympathizing with them,
said: " **-_/-.= *;;-
"Well, boys, we did the best we could
and we were beaten out by a popular
young man who is the choice of San
Francisco.
"This is not a victory for the Exam
iner-Rainey combination, nor did the
Fire Department knock us out. It was
simply this: Mayor Phelan told the
community that he wanted a certain
ticket elected and the people did his
bidding.
"He is a popular young man and he
has the confidence of the people, and
there is no doubt that he will place a
ticket in the field that will sweep
everything in sight on next election
day." * '
When one of Mr. Buckley's followers
spoke up and asked what the next
move would be, Mr. Buckley said:
"The only thing we can do. boys, is
to take off our coats on election day,
fall In line and vote the Democratic
ticket."
One of the surprises In the Demo-

cratic camp is the defeat of the Com
mute of One Hundred's ticket in the
Thirty-eight District. Judge Wallace,
who was on that ticket, presided at the
recent Phelan mass meeting. Colo
nel Thomas F. Barry, Bert Schlesinger,
J. C. McKinstrv and others went down
with the wreck in the Thirty
eighth. Greany in this district downed
Fay of the Reform Democracy. The
fight leaves a bitter feeling.

McNAB GLORIES IN
THE PRIMARY LAW
Â£â .. â primary election law is
an assured success. It is a
reform that has done more
__â¢ for the people at one stroke
than any legislation attempt
ed or accomplished in this genera
tion except the Australian ballot
law, and it is of equal importance
with that great measure.
The result accomplished by the
Democratic County Committee,
otherwise known as the Committee
of One Hundred, is a vindication of
its course of uncompromising and
aggressive honesty. The commit
tee took the position that it would
not recognize or compromise with
Rainey any more than with Buck
ley. They were both partners in
the same transactions. It kept its
hands clean, having nothing to do
with either of them.
Its nominees last year kept their
pledges to the people, and as far
as power lay in them gave good
government to San Francisco.
There is every reason to suppose
that the ticket which this free con
vention of reputable citizens will
nominate will be the best ever of
fered to the voters of the city. I
believe that the victory for de
cency achieved by the committee
means that the good government
for which so many have been con
tending under all sorts of dis
couragements for many years has
at last been accomplished for San
Francisco. GAVIN McNAB.
INCIDENTS OF THE DAY.
Braunhart Bitterly Fought in
the Twenty - Ninth by the
Rainey-Buckley Combine.
The Twenty-eighth District was a hot
bed of excitement, though no trouble of a
serious nature occurred. The vote
throughout the district was heavy and
rather steady. The rivalry between Buck
ley's forces and Sam Rainey's push was
keen, and at times it looked as if the two
elements would get sadly tangled up. The
Third Precinct, in front of 207 Second
street, was the liveliest polling place In
the district. Larry Conlon, Buckley's
chief lieutenant in the Twenty-eighth,
looked after the blind man's Interests in
this precinct, and Henry Healey and Jack
Greeley had the Rainey-Phelan end in
their hands. The double-cross was neatly
executed by Buck's outfit, and his dele
gates as a result were fully fifty votes to
the good. At 11 o'clock Monday night on
of Rainey's representatives entered Do
lan's lodging-house and made a deal with
Brick whereby he would turn over fifty
voters who lodged in the house for 50 cent
a vote. Shortly after midnight Larry
Conlon is said to have sat down with
Brick and raised the price to $1. At an
rate when the polls* opened in the morn
ing four hacks were driven up to the door
of Brick's lodging-house and his colonists
were given a free ride to the polls. Each
held a Buckley ticket, and it is safe to
predict that they voted it straight. John
nie Ferris, with the Fire Department be
hind him, had charge of the Rainey en
of it in the lower portion of the district.
Martin Kelly made his usual fight in the
First Precinct, at 313 Main street, and in
the upper end of the district Barney
Dougherty and Peg-leg Daly marshaled
the regular Republican forces. The op
posing Central Republican League faction
was largely in evidence all over the dis
trict, but voted silently.
When the polls closed it was though
that Sammy Braunhart's ticket in the
Twenty-ninth District was snowed under.
Rainey's adherents and the Buckley fac
tion combined and made a bitter battle
against Braunhart's ticket. "Anything to
beat" Braunhart," was the cry*.
About 4 o'clock in the afternoon a re
port was circulated about the district that
Sammy Braunhart was weeping bitter
tears at the corner of Fourth and Harri
son streets. .Matt Lally, his assistant-ln
chief, at once dispatched a messenger to
ascertain whether or not the report was
correct. The vote was quite heavy all
over the district and seemed to be evenly
divided between the Democrats and Re
publicans. Windy Dick Creighton, Tom
Brosnan and Jim Farrell made Buckley's
battle, and Jimmie Maher and Joe Plunk
ctt had charge of Braunhart's end. John
nie Glynn and Charlie Corey had charge
of the regulars, and they were given a
warm battle by the representatives of
the Central Republican organization. The
voting was done in an orderly manner de
spite the bitter rivalry existing between
the opposing factions.
A fight was narrowly averted in the
Sixteenth precinct of the Thirtieth Dis
trict early in the forenoon, the presence
of four husky policemen alone preventing
a serious outbreak. The row started over
the vote cast by John Bigelow, a Buckle
Democrat, who registered from Alex
Greggains' house. He was denounced by
J. H. Hogan, challenger for the regular
Democrats, and arrested. Greggains ap
peared at the polling place soon after ac
companied by a gang of strikers, evident
ly bent upon making trouble. Hot words
were exchanged and Hogan threatened
to brain Greggains with a chair. At this
juncture the police interfered and hus
tled the entire outfit out into the street.
In the melee one of the ward heelers re
ceived a blow on the nose that started the
blood flowing, but he could not tell who
hit him and no arrests were made. Kai
n.y had combined with the Regular Dem
ocrats, and his henchmen, under the lead
ership of Assistant Chief Dougherty of
the Fire Department, made a desperate
effort to defeat Greggains. The former
claimed a victory over the Buekleyites
early In the game. The latter, however,
put up a strong fight and Greggains
claimed he would carry the district for
the blind boss. This Is a strong Demo
cratic district and the Republicans polled
a comparatively small percentage of the
vote. The Citizens' Republican ticket had

UPRISING AGAINST
BOSSES, SAYS DODGE
WITH the natural feeling of
exhilaration which now
controls me it is hard for
me to collect my thoughts
sufficiently to tell how it happened.
But I will say that the new pri
mary law is one of the factors that
made the overturning of the bosses
possible. The new law is a most
unqualified success. If it were
not for the protection it gives
the voters in the way of secrecy
and by compelling all who attempt
to have a voice in the selection of
the delegates to establish their
identity and right to cast a vote,
the result of; to-day's election
might have been different. This
is demonstrated by the returns,
for in the districts that were hith
erto entirely under the control of
the bosses we have won out by the
largest majorities. ,
"I attribute our victory to the
fact that we as American citizens
believe in self-representation. The
same spirit that prompted our
forefathers to cast off the yoke of
Great Britain prompted us to-day
to cast off the yoke of bossism.
It has become revolting to the peo
ple to think that they had to go to
the polls and have pointed out to
them the men for whom they were
told they had to vote. That is what
caused this uprising.
"The Central Republican Com
mittee has no bossâ no one has
had more to say in its councils
than another. We have all worked
in harmony and for what we
thought was for the best interests
of the people, and with that spirit
we could not help but win.
"I am not surprised at the result.
The people were bound to be the
victors If they were only given a
chance and the new primary law
gave them that opportunity. It
forces upon us the conviction that
the motto on our great American
dollar should be not only 'In God
We Trust,' but 'In God and the
People We Trust.'
"No railroad influence will be
felt at our convention and no such
Influence has been shown in our
campaign. If they have helped us
it has been voluntary on their part,
without our knowledge and be
cause they thought our victory
would be best for the city. No in
fluence has been back of us but
that of God and the people. I
would have been ashamed of the
city and the people who live here
if the result had been otherwise.
"I cannot say who will be our
nominees; that matter rests entire
ly with the convention. I feel con
fident, however, that our delegates
will select the best list of nom
inee- ever presented to the voters
of San Francisco. Clean and able
men will be chosen and our ticket
will be elected from the Mayor
right down the line. Last year
Mayor Phelan won by the votes of
the" very Republicans who this
year vanquished the bosses by
starting this great reform move
ment. They will cast their votes
at the next election for our nom
inees and with their support I can
not figure how we can possibly
lose.
"Care will be exercised in the
selection of our county committee.
Tt should be composed of men who ,
are ready and willing to give their ,
time to the party; to guard it i
against entanglements; to protect <
the rights of the people, and give i
the voters the fullest opportunity '
to express their will. The commit- :
tee will be composed of repfesen- ,
tative men.

no opposition and but little attention was
paid to it. The Socialists also cut very
little figure in the district.
* Despite the fact that there were six
tickets in the field in the Thirty-fifth As
sembly District, not a protest or a harsh
word was heard during the hours of "vot
ing The representatives of the different
tickets in the various precincts were all
neighbors and acted in a neighborly man
ner toward each other. If a man was
seen approaching the polling place there
was no rush made to capture his vote
Instead he was greeted as a friend and as
such cast his fortunes with any ticket he
chose When the booths were opened at
6 o'clock the tide of voters began to flow
in Nearly half the ballots cast in the
precincts were voted between the hours of
8 and 10 o'clock. Fifty per cent of the
votes in the district were cast without
of bad whisky and a
sofdle? create,! considerable excitement at
the polling place of the E nty-lourtn
Precinct 2036 Greenwich' street. The sol
dier insisted upon running things In the
electlor booth, and it required the com
bined efforts of the policeman and sev
eral of the election officers to subdue him
and prepare him for the patrol wagon.

WESTERN ADDITION.
The election in the Thirty-seventh As
-1 sembly District passed off quietly. With
the exception of a drunken rowdy, who
attempted to run things to suit himself
In the Fifty-fifth Precinct and who was
promptly suppressed, nothing of an ex
citing nature occurred.
â  The Republicans had two tickets in the
fieid and the Democrats three, namely,
the Buckley ticket, the Committee of One
Hundred and the Independent Democrats.
The supporters of the Buckley ticket
i worked indefatigably in the interest of
' the "blind boss.'' and at the close of the
polls they declared that the count would
: show that they had won the day.
Considerable enthusiasm was manifest-
I ed in the election in the Thirty-eighth
Assembly District. Some time before the
polls were opened motley crowds assem
bled in front of the different Dooths. ap
parently anxious to cast their ballots.
The Republicans had two tickets In the
fleld and the Democrats a similar num
: ber. The vote was unusually heavy, over
i 250 being polled before 10 o'clock. Several
political heelers attempted to dictate to
i the Judge of the election in the Sixty

i off by the police.
