JL jl numerous cities of the State and ;
! <
many business firms and indi
viduals to relieve the great distress j
that now exists among tho flood suf- i
ferers in the several counties along the
lower bottoms of the Brazos River.
Governor Sayers received the follow
ing reply to his telegram of last night
to R. A. Alger asking that Federal aid j
be rendered the starving and famine- !
bound people: j
WASHINGTON, I.1 '. C. July 6.âGover
nor Joseph I). Savers, Austin. Texas: The j
Chief of Engineers will .place at your j
oriler all the boats available at Galveston
anil the comman .ins officer at San Anto
nio has been directed to place at your
immediate disposal ten thousand rations
and to confer with you as. to points of de
livery, ': a. ALGER,
Secretary of War.
Immediately on receipt of this tele
gram Governor Sayers Instructed Ad
jutant General Thomas to begin the ; ,
work of sending the rations to those j
river points which can he reached by J
railroad, transportation. The greatest j j
destruction, according to reports that ]
have heen received here to-day, is i
found in Wallet Washington^; Austin, i Â«
Brazosia and Burleson counties. it is j
estimated that there are not less than ' *â 
10,000 negroes, men. women and chil
dren, in these five counties who have
been wholly with food and shelter !
for nearly three days. The small I ,
towns along the banks of the river have"! ,
been depleted of their stores and pro- ! ,
visions, and in some places the inhabit- j ,
ants who suffered no personal loss i ,
or damage from the inundation are ; ,
also without food supplies. This con- \ ;
dition of affairs is particularly true of .
a number of towns that have been cut I ]
off from railroad communications with ' â 
the outside world for several days. | ,
The stories of death devastation!:
and starvation come from several;;
points along the river from Burleson ,
county to Matagorda county, a djstaiic. â¢
of over 200 miles, and are harrowing ,
and ghastly in their nature.
The flood did not begin to subside!
near the Gulf last night, as had been j
expected, but continued to rise until ;
about noon to-day. and since lien has
been almost at a standstill. The South
ern Pacific Railroad, which was believ- |
ed to be far* above the highest water â 
mark of the Brazos and the Colorado j
rivers, was forced to submit to the In
evitable last evening:, and all through
traffic on that road is tied up. Many
miles of railroad track have been
washed out. The San Antonio and Ar- !
ansas Pass and the Missouri. Kansas ;
and Texas roads also suffered addi- '
tional washouts on the main track to- i
day.
The extensive State penitentiary in
Fort Bend County is under water to
a depth of several feet, and the loss
to the State from the ruined sugar cane j
crop, sugar houses and other valuable
properties will aggregate $300,000. The
sugar plantation of Colonel E. H. Cun- ;
ningham, one of the wealthiest sugar
planters In the South, is also in the
flooded district. Hjs loss is said to 1. â¢
great. Fears are entertained as to the i
safety of several hundred penitentiary
convicts who were leased to Colonel j
Cunningham and other sugar planters
of that section.
The San Francisco Call.
In five counties of Texas it is I
estimated that ten thousand ne
groes are starving to death as the
result of the floods which have
swept down upon the State within
the .ast forty-eight hours, and in j
the entire flooded district there j
are 40,000 people homeless and
hungry. In recent years no such
widespread calamity has come
upon any Southern State. â¢
The Governor cf Texas has j ;
taken prompt measures to relieve \ <
the flood sufferers, and the Sec- j
rst?ry of War has placed the \â ,
Commissary Department and the
whole resources of the Govern
ment at the Governor command.
This rel.ef, however, is but tem
porary. The people have lost
iheir crops with the rest, and for
at least a year must be objects cf
public charity.
The town of Richmond, which has
been partly under water since yester- ;
day, was one of the most prosperous j
places in the Brazos Valley. It was the
center of trade for a large section of
rich agricultural country. The loss to j
thai town alone from the overflow will
aggregate many thousands of dollars.
Henry Worberg, a well-known cotton
planter of Washington County, arrived
here to-day and purchased a large
amount of supplies for refugees in that
section. He said that the situation
among the negroes of Washington and
Burleson counties, whose homes and all
of whose belongings have been swept
away, is beyond description. He spent
the past four days with rescuing parties j
in boats saving water-bound people
from death by drowning and starva
tion. He estimated that 700 people,
mostly negroes, were rescued from tree
tops and small islands in those two
counties and that there are probably
! fifty others who were not found in time
Ito say.- them from death either by
I drowning or starvation. The suffering
! among the women and children who i
i spent from two to three days in tree- j
j tops while watching and waiting to be j
rescued was pitiful to witness.
"The distress among the people of
the Brazos bottoms is indescribable."
Mr. Worberg said. "The negroes are
absolutely helpless. There is no oppor
tunity for them to work and when the
flood subsides it will be impossible for
them to make another crop. The result
is that their present suffering is likely
to continue indefinitely unless outside
aid comes to them. There are thou
sands of starving mouths to feed in al
most every county along the lower
course of the Brazos River.
"In our work of rescuing the living
we could make no attempt to bury
the dead. 1 saw probably a total of
fifteen bodies in the river and in tree
tops during the time I was engaged in
the rescuing work. The loss of life, in
Burleson and Washington counties is
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JULY" 7, 1899.
. .---â  â¢" â â 
probably several times more than that,
and the number may never be known.
Rut few of the negro families were pro
vided with boats, and when the flood
came down upon them they were
washed away, unless they could get
into trees or upon higher ground. It
is the first biff rise in the Brazos River
since 1861, and of late years 'he negroes
became careless and built their homes
closer and closer to the channel of the
river."
Governor Sayers to-day received in
formation that the total number of I
flood sufferers was not less than 40.000, j
and that the necessity of immediate aid !
in the way of food was urgent. Acting
on these advices the Governor request
ed of the Secretary of War that an ad
ditional 10,000 rations be furnished the
famishing people. The request was
granted. Five thousand rations will be
shipped from Fort Sam. Houston to j
Richmond, Fort Bend County, and 5000 |
to Scaly, Austin County. The other i
10,000 rations will be distributed from'
places in that section. Captain S. P.
Seiker, quartermaster of the Texas ;
Rangers, %vent to Richmond to-night j
to superintend the distribution of re
tions.
Adjutant General Thomas Scurry re- \
ceived a telegram to-night from J. J. j
Mulkane of Scaly. Austin County, stat
ing that there are about 800 people in a
famished condition north of there.
There is one colony of over 500 refugees
on a little plot of high land surrounded
by water. They have been there for
three .lays without .food or shelter.
With them are 200 head of -cattle and
thousands of snakes and wild animals.
Mr. Mulkane says in his telegram
that many men. women and children
are sick from having been bitten by
venomous snakes, from exposure and
from lack of food.
NEGROES RESCUED AND
FED BY GOVERNMENT
GALVESTON, Tex.. July 6.â Reports
from a special correspondent of the
News indicate that while the property
loss by the recent floods has been enor
mous the loss of life has been greatly
exaggerated. "According to the News
only five lives have been lost in the
lower Brazos flood.
From 1500 to 2000 colored people were
caught in the valley In Austin, Watter
and Fort Bend counties and were forced
to take to the trees and housetops.
A special train left this afternoon for
the flooded district, carrying several
Government and a number of private
boats. It is believed that nearly all the
people lodged in trees and on housetops
have been rescued, but boats sent from
Galveston to-day will patrol the flooded
district and make a thorough search for
stragglers.
The War Department has authorized
Governor Sayers to distribute 10,000
army rations among the flood sufferers,
the rations to be furnished the Gov
ernor from San Antonio. In addition
Houston and Galveston have sent sev
eral carloads of groceries into the
flooded district- It is believed there is
now food enough in transit to feed the
negroes until the waters recede and
they can return to plantation work.
The next trouble will be at Velasco,

RENNES, France, July 6.â
Mme. Dreyfus, on leaving
the prison to-day, appeared
in much better spirits than yes
terday. It was evident that her
conversation with her husband
had been of a more cheerful na
ture. A large crowd had gath
ered in the hope of witnessing her
arrival and departure, but the
gendarmes cleared the streets ad
jacent to the prison and the spec
tators caught only a passing
glimpse of her as she drove away
rapidly in a closed carriage to the
residence of Mme. Goddard.
The latter left her house to-day
and took up quarters temporarily
at the residence of a relative in
another part of the town, in order
to allow the Dreyfus family full
freedom in using her mansion.
From a point overlooking the
prison the correspondent of the
Associated Press saw Captain
Dreyfus emerge into the court
yard to-day for an hour's exer-
cise. He was dressed in a blue
serge suit and wore a soft felt hat.
He walked slowly across the yard
with his hands in the pockets of
his jacket bis head slightly bent
forward, so that it was impossible
to see the features.
As he crossed the yard he was

LONDON, July 7. â The Times announces that several officers have been ordered to proceed
to South Africa to organize the residents as well as the police and local forces at various
points on the frontier.
"Additional special service officers," says the Times, '"are likely to be sent out during the
next few days, and the commander-in-chief has been engaged in completing the composition and
organization of a larger force, which it will be necessary to dispatch should negotiations with the
Transvaal fail.''
PRETORIA, July 6. â The Volksraad sat in secret session, President Kruger and the ne
gotiators from "the Orange Free State being present. It is understood an agreement was reached
to grant the franchise immediately to all settlers prior to 1880 and to other classes of residents
within seven years, the naturalization clause to be optional. These proposals will be debated in
open session to-morrow.
Although Sir Alfred Milner. on behalf of Great Britain, demanded at the Bloemfontein
conference that a residence of five years should be a qualification for the franchise, it is believed
that the terms said to have been agreed upon to-day. in the Volksraad might, be acceptable to
the Uitlanders. if suitable guarantees were given for the execution of the promised reforms-

Peculiar Incidents Surrounding a Case
That Bore the Seeming of
a Mystery.
John R. Rathom's Infatuation for Miss Florence
Campbell Develops a Queer State
of Affairs.
A BOX of poisoned candy
through the mails, two women
who claimed to have been
made ill by eating it, and a
strange reticence on the part
of all concerned in the matter, made a
case which puzzled the police for a
short while yesterday, and thyen dwin
dled into the uncovering of another
story of man's duplicity and a wrecked
home.
The police say there will be no ar
rests and there is a disposition on the
part of all connected to hush the matter
up with the least possible publicity.
Last Friday the postman delivered to
; Mrs. Elsie Scheib. at 610 Ellis street, a
i package addressed to Miss Florence M.
Campbell, a young woman who for
merly roomed at the Scheib house.
When Miss Campbell called later in the
day the package was given to her, and
on opening it she found that it con
tained candied cherries. She offered
the confections to Mrs. Scheib and her
two assistants and partook of some
herself.
The girls declined to eat the candy,
saying that they were afraid that it
was another case similar to that of
Mrs. Botkin.
Immediately after eating the candy
Mrs. Scheib and Miss Campbell be
came ill. vomiting and complaining of
headache.
Dr. Stinson and Dr. Knckein were
railed to see Mrs. Scheib, and while
they would not pronounce the case one
of arsenical poisoning they adminis
tered the proper antidotes for that
drug. Mrs. Scheib rapidly recovered
Crow her indisposition and was soon
out of all danger. Miss Campbell went
."to the Central Pharmacy and showed
one of the cherries with a white pow
der in the center and asked for an an
tidote for arsenic. It was given her,
and she went to her room.
The matter was not made public until
yesterday, and the police were not noti
fied except by common report. When
an attempt was made to verify the re
port at the house of the Scheibs the
story was strenuously denied and ev
ery one was told that no box was re
ceived and no one was made ill. Later,
however, when the police took the mat
ter up the story was admitted to be
true, and in the development of the
investigation a family skeleton was
laid bare and another story of illicit
love and deserted wife is made public.
John R. Rathom. a newspaper man.
visited Chief of Police Lees yesterday
and told substantially the following in
regard to the supposed mystery.
Several months ago Rathom and Miss
Campbell became infatuated with each
other and he. left his home and lived
with the woman as his wife,
rooming at Scheib's. Mrs. Rathom.
hearing of the affair, became convinced
that Miss Campbell had been imposed
upon by her husband and visited the
woman and talked the matter over with
her. The result was that a friendship
sprung up between the women and Mrs.
Rathom did what she could to assist the
girl. Later Mrs. Rathom became con
vinced that Miss Campbell was deceiv
ing her and the friendly relations were
broken, Mrs. Rathom writing Miss
Campbell a letter, in which she up
braided her and told her she would
have nothing more to do with her.
Immediately after the poisoned candy
had been eaten Miss Campbell sent for
Rathom and told him that she believed
his wife had sent it. She showed him
the box and wrapper and he imme
diately recognized his wife's writing.
The address was on an envelope and
was pasted c-n the wrapper. It had the
appearance of having been cat from a
letter and part of the name had been
cut off.
Rathom was told that unless he got
his wife to sign an agreement to leave
the State and secure a divorce or allow j
him to secure one the matter would be
made public. He was also asked to pay
$50 to Mr. Scheib for the expenses of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
I medical attendance on his wife.
! Rathom' took the box and wrapper
and confronted his wife, who denied all
knowledge of the matter. She admitted
that it was her writing, hut said that it
evidently had been taken from some
letter that she had written.
Rathom then took the candy to
Thomas Price for chemical analysis,
and it was found that the cherries con
tained arsenic in sufficient quantity to
i kill.
Mrs. Rathom also made a statement
, to Chief Lees which was substantially
the same as that of her husband.
Miss Campbell was seen last night
just after she had been clos
eted for two hours . with de
tectives and said that the whole mat
ter was in the hands of the police. She
said that she accused no one and would
prosecute no one unless the police told
her to do so. she was asked to relate
the incidents of the receipt of the candy
and said:
"When the box came. Mr. Scheib said:
'Why. you don't know who sent that
candy: you had better not eat it." and I
replied: "Yes. I believe I know who sent
it I think it was sent by a friend of
mine in Oakland.* Mr. Scheib said: 'I
have seen that writing before. Don't
you know who it was?' I said: 'fes, I
know the writing; it might be Mrs.
Rathom.' "
She was then asked: "Why did you
eat the candy, when you recognized
her writing, when you knew she was
bitter against you," and she replied: "I
didn't know she sent it."
She was then asked whether she sent
the box of candy herself, and she an
swered: "No, do you suppose I would
give poison to my dear friend Mrs.
Scheib? I got a letter from Mrs.
Rathom at the s-rrrrfe time threatening
me. That letter is in" the hands of the
police."
When asked what, its contents con
sisted of, she said, it was not exactly
threatening, but it was insulting, in
that Mrs. Rathom said she had found
her out and would do nothing more to
help her.
Detectives Dillon and McMahon made
no report last night and the police gave
out very guarded statements. They
said there would be no arrests, as it was
evident that no attempt had been made
to poison anybody and that poisoned
candy had not been sent for the purpose
of killing anybody. Further than this
they declined to enter into the case.
When Rathom was seen last evening
he said that he did not wish to discuss
the case and that he had no idea who
sent the candy. He said:
"I deny, in my opinion, that Miss
Campbell ever saw the package before
it was given to her last Friday night at
the Scheib house."
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR
ANTI-TRUST MOVERS
Governor of Washington Criticized
for Refusing to Attend
the Conference.
AUSTIN. Tex., July 6.â Governor Sayers
to-day received a letter from Governor
Deforest of Wyoming, stating that he is
in hearty sympathy with the anti-trust
movement and that it will give him great
pleasure to attend the conference of Gov
ernors and ' Attorney Generals to be held
in St. Louis if his plans will allow him.
Governor Sayers also received a letter
from Insurance Commissioner C. G. Hef
ner of the State of Washington as fol
lows:
"Most of the officials of this State have
observed with much appreciation jour in
itiatory efforts In calling a convention of
the Governors of the several States of
the I'nion to take such steps as may ap
pear advisable to prevent the formation
and continuance of the trusts and com
binations in restraint of trade and com
petition. We have also viewed with much
chagrin the action of the Governor of this
State in refusing to attend such conven
tion, either in person or by representa
tive. On this question the Governor is
not in accord with the overwhelming ma
jority of the fusion party of this State
and he stands absolutely alone among the
State officials. 1 desire to inquire, there
fore, if you would receive .some other
official to represent this State, who should
be chosen and properly accredited by the
other State officials.
"The question is one of such command
ing importance that the mere whim of
one man ought not to be allowed to place
the Democratic forces of this State in a
wrong light .jefore the people of this
country. I believe you are entitled to the
active support of ail people who believe
b: government by the people as -against
government by the corporations and syn
dicates, and to 'his end the officials of this
State, the Governor alone excepted, de
sire to assist you in every way possible."

FOUR NOTABLE EVENTS
CITY SPORTS OFFER A
FORTUNE FOR A FIGHT
Local Rivals Will Give Jeffries and Sharkey a
Purse of Forty Thousand Dollars,
Charles Newman and the Glen Park Company Are Bidders for
the Battlefield When the Pugilistic Championship Will
Be Decided-Proposals Meet With Approval.
....â â - -..--.â ...â â¢â 
IT was a red-letter day yesterday in '
local sporting circles. The coming
of Jeffries, the world's champion
pugilist, was the signal for an out
' pouring of sporting enthusiasm
which reached its climax -- â "'â "'â 
offers to the champion and to Sharkey j
to make this city the seen-* of their j
â¢ . intend* _ contest for championship hon- j
ll â¢' â¢ .
' '<:'.. '
The first offer has been made by j
'â â â  â Charles Newman, ho, as a guarantee
of his" sincerity in the affair, as de- :
; posited with The Call a certified check
for $5000. 1
Newman, acting solely _n his own be- j
-V half, .offers a purse of $40,000, the con- |
;;" test to bc-'held in his city at the Velo
>'Â« drome on Fell and Baker streets.
T- This is the first definite offer in rcf
'*' erence to the prospective fistic duel and

. . sport's wildly enthusiastic and to win
i -from the nupilirtie rivals, if not an ab j
solute answer, an encouragement
; which promises ultimate acceptance,
Newman conceived the idea of at
.';. tempting to secure the fight for this
. cil some time ago. In the first place
... Jeffries is a Callforrfian and Sharkey
y- has long l-.e.-n identified with Califor
â¢'â¢"*â  nians. An unusual State interest has
â '_ been created, therefore, in their pros
Â«* r,->tivo hitil'f
'-" P-.. tn * I,aiu " . ,â â .â¢â â â â¦",
.-â¢â  Thus far Newmans proposal is the
,- ; oniy one that makes this city tne* scene
f; of the fight. Newman needs only to
" .receive the acceptance of Jeffries and
"Sharkey to complete th" arrangements
which are already almost complete.

â¢ "drome and bounded by Fell, Hayes.
â  â â  ,'â  â  * "â -â '"'.''â '__' ;
: Baker nnd Lyon streets, has already
' been secured if the fight takes place in
1 this city.
It is Newman's purpose to have the!
. contest held in the daytime on what- j
, ever date the principals care to select. â 
the month 'of September being suggest- ;
ed as a good limit.
*''-*'" '.The' 'Velodrome has a .capacity for ;
.. 15,000 persons ancl is an id?al structure
for such a battle.' Having arranged to
secure the Vi iodrome in preference to
other large enclosures and halls in the
city, Newman discussed the necessary
arrangements to make the fight a suc
cess. These plans ha < even included
the prices of admission which will be
charged if th fight takes lace in this
city. The projector considers that seats
could be sold for $3. $5, $10, $15, $20 and
$40 each, according to location.
When it was seen that it is feasible
and In many ways profitable to secure
- . the fight for this city Newman made
. out a certified check for $5000 payable
to The Call. This money will be held
by The Call for thirty days. During
that time the pugilists can reach a de
*. cision, it will be evident to them that
the scheme promises a profit to its pro
jector and a financial benefit to the
city. Sports from all parts of the
United States will come here to wit
ness the contest. Under the conditions
of the case these men will be the best
of' their class and will have money to
.'-spend. Local devotees of pugilism who
would have traveled to the scene of the
fight wherever it might have been will
remain at home and spend their money
here.
Th' contest would excite, the interest
of the sporting fraternity of the world
and San Francisco would necessarily
receive in influx of visitors, whose
â "-presence would mean profit to many
asses in the community. As the local
law on glove contests reads now
twenty rounds constitute the limit. It
Is thought that an except!* might be
made in this instance and that the Su
pervisors might be Induced.'tq raise the
limit to twenty-five rounds, r j
In speaking of the matter yesterday
Newman gave .very assurance that his
offer was made in absolute good faith.

hands of The Call," 'he said, "as a

1 will leave this check with The Call

this contest would be a success, but
thai is my gamble and I am willing to
make it. I know that In many ways
there would be a benefit to the city t<
hold the fight here. It would attract
widespread interest and would draw to j
the city the better class of sports in
the United States.
""The Velodrome is the best place in
Snn Francisco to hold such a contest,

it in the event of the fight taking place

Quick upon the heels of Newman's
offer mmc another from the Glen Park
Company, which sees the advantage of
having the fight held in San Francisco
or its vicinity, and particularly at Glen

Park Company is willing to make a de
posit with some responsible party to
be mutually agreed upon for any sum
to the full amount of the purse as soon
as all the conditions are satisfactorily
arranged, j Yours truly,
"H. I. McGILL,
"Manager Glen Park Company."
This offer differs from that of New
man in no essential. The Glen Park
| Company provides for a contest of
| thirty rounds, while Newman Is re
stricted to the limit fixed by the local
j authorities. The only important ques
j tion involved is locality, and the fight
| ers and their managers have only to de
j cide between a central, accessible city
â¢â  location and Glen Park. The question
j of rounds will without doubt be satis
| factorily answered.
The Glen Park Company will also de
posit with The Call this morning a cer
j tified check for $5000 as a guarantee of
j its good faith in the matter. This
would have been done last night, but
the offer of the company was made
after banking hours." The manager of
the company declares that his people
are enthusiastically in earnest over the
project and believe that no better scene
for the battle could he found than at ,
Glen Park. This rivalry of bidders for
the great fight, taken into consideration
with the enormous amount of the
purses offered, gives promise that San
Francisco or its vicinity will win the
prize that is being sought. Nothing like
these offers has yet been made from
any other part of the country, and
what the big fighters say Indicates that
at least one battle - for the pugilistic
championship of the world will receive
its local coloring from San Francisco.
VIEWS OF THE SPORTS.
Opinions on the Proposition to
Pull Off the Fight in San
Francisco.
The prospect of securing the great
battle In or near this city was received
with unqualified enthusiasm last night.
The opinions of many of the local
sports are given in the interviews that
follow:
Champion James J. JeffriesâCali
fornia is my home and I would rather
fight Tom Sharkey here than on any
other spot on earth. I am sincere
about this, and if there is any possi
bility of bringing off the bout in San
j Francisco I "will do all in my power to
I encourage it. Nearly all my intfmate
friends live in California. Since the
match was first made many prominent
sporting men have declared that New
York is the only place to bring of
the battle, and their declaration was
backed by the argument that the big
fight promoters of the Eastern mc
i tropolis could afford to bid higher
than anybody in San Francisco. Now,
i I disagree with them on that point.
; This city is perhaps one of the most
i enthusiastic boxing centers in the
j world. "We ought to get just as big a
j purse here as we would in New York
â¢â  cr anywhero else. If any reliable
fight promoter offers us inducements
which, equal those offered in New
York I will certainly be pleased to
meet Sharkey in this city. â 
"Billy Delaney, manager for Jeffriesâ
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1899.
NEWMAN BINDS HIS BIG OFFER WITH A CHECK.
Nothing In the world would please Jeffries
and myself more than to have California
the scene of our next fight. "Jeff" i.- es
sentially a Callfornian. Unlike other men
who have made their reputations here be
has no desire to live elsewhere. He fought
with gloves made here and all his
thoughts are of California. We are not
tied up to any club and if equal induce
ments are offered here we will use all
our Influence for the local club. We are
not convinced yet that Sharkey will enter
the ring. It seems appropriate that these
two men, both claiming California as
their place of residence, should be brought
together here.
Young Mitchellâ A meeting in this city
between Sharkey and Jeffries for the box
ing championship of the world would at
tract unusual attention toward this city.
Sporting men from all over America
would come here and spend their money
freely. The men of this city are the most
liberal patrons of sport in the world,
which in Itself guarantees the success of
the project.
Eugene Van Courtâ The boxers should,
if possible, tight here, where both are
well known and where they received their
first start up Hie championship ladder. 1
know it would please Jeffries to fight
here, more especially if he had Sharkey
for an opponent Every effort should be
made to bring the men together here.
Bert Nasonâ Quote me as being strongly
in favor 0. the big mill being held in this
city. We have a great sporting element
on this coast and the bout were to take
place in San Francisco, the lovers of the
sport would flow ln from all quarters. It
would be to the advantage of both Shar
key and Jeffries to fight on this coast,
as they could train with more comfort.
Again there is .-very Indication thai the
.porting people of the entire country
would come to the coast and witness the
fight. This would mean the spending of
lots of money and would be a big thing
to the merchants.* I am afraid that the
Eastern clubs will offer a much larger
purse, but I for one hope that the heavy
weights will settle their differences right
here. * .
Joseph Kennedyâ T would like to see the
men fight In San Francisco. They might
draw much better in the East, but this
being their home town, with good man
agement, they could easily equal their
money-making chances. I hope they will
meet in this city. ._
Aleck Greggains referee and fight man- I
agerâlf Jeffries and Sharkey were to ;
figlft here it would be. the best thing that
ever -truck the town. They can make
as much money right here as they can
in the Kast. No matter where they fight
people will travel to see the mill, and if
the match' were to be pulled off here the
city would be thronged with people and
business would boom. I heard that a
purse' lias been offered tne men by re
liable people, and I only hope they will
be tempted to accept it.' I am heartily
in. favor of the big go being pulled off
here.
De Witt Van Courtâ l don't see why the
fight can't be nulled off here. This is
one of the best sporting towns - of its size
in the world.- The people have shown by
their attendance at the various fights
that they love the sport, and it is there
fore my opinion that if the bout were to
be pulled off in San Francisco they could
(i.i nearly as well as in the Kast. I heard
they were offered a big purse by the Glen
Park reople. 1 hope both Sharkey and
Jeffries will look favorably upon their
offer as it is made by reliable people. It
Is my opinion that the Glen Park people
would even offer more to get the big
fight, and I for one wish them the best
of success. Such a battle In San Fran
cisco would be a splendid thing for the
sport.
Al Smith, manager of Tom Traceyâ am
afraid the men will go East as the offers
there are higher and the men are cer
tain of a big attendanace. I favor their
fighting in this city, and if they do I think
they will draw a big crowd. I would like
to witness the mill and hope It Is pulled
off here.
Billy Jordan, famous master of cere
monies- Will they fight her*? That is a
hard question to answer. There are more
people In New York,- but I don't think
they are as great lovers of the sport as
our own Callfornlans. If ' the heavy
weights could be got to fight in tills
city people would travel miles to see the
"go." It is beyond my expectation to see
the championship battle decided in San
Francisco, but I would be delighted to
see it brought about.
Harry Corbettâ Hold the championship
battle here by all moans. I do not make
this statement for selfish motives. I sin
cerely believe that it will be beneficial to
the City and State at large. It, will at
tract thousands of Eastern people here,
and in my judgment act as a stimulus to
every business in town.
Billy Nolanâ There Is no reason why
Sharkey and Jeffries can't meet in this
city. San Francisco has possibly more
ardent boxing enthusiasts than any other
city In the Union. It would be a good
thing for the city and I hope the project
will be realized.
Colonel Brad:. â Both mien got their start
in this city, and they should overlook a
whole lot In order to bring off their cham
pionship battle among the people who
started them on the road to fame and
fortune.
Billy ( 'arkeekâ San Francisco should bid
as high for the fight as any city in the
world.
Charlie Longâ l am glad that there Is a
possibility of bringing off the big go In
this city. Sharkey and Jeffries should
both warm to the proposition.
Sam Dannenbaumâ l would like to see
the big fellows get together in this city.
Both are better known here than any
place else on the continent, and I believe
the people out here are more interested
in them than any other place In the world.
Billy Prattâ thing ever happened
the town. Get Jeff and the sailor to
gether in this city by all means.
Jimmie Lawlorâ l think the big fight
should be pulled off here. There Is no
reason why Sharkey and Jeffries can't get
as much money here as any place else.
Tom Tracyâ Francisco should get
"â : â~ .' - -:' *".
' the big fight, and if there is the slightest
chance to bring it off here everybody
; in town should boost it along.
Jack Stelznerâ Sharkey and . Jeffries
ought to draw better here than in New
York. Of course the Eastern city has the
] advantage of population and wealth, but
' the people out here like the game better
than they do in the East.
Phil Wand-Sharkey and Jeffries should
I do better here than any place else on the
continent. . They ought to be able to put
up a better fight here, too, both being
thoroughly acclimated. .- .*
J. J. Groom^Let them fight here. They
both made their reputations in this State
and why should they not settle their dis
pute to the title in our midst? It would
be a great thing for the town, and I hope
they fight here. People would put up big
money to see Sharkey and Jeffries in the
ring, and I therefore think the men would
do as well in this city as they would in
the East. There are a hundred an.l one
reasons why the battle should take place
here, and I hope the fighters themselves
will bear a few of them in mind.
Gus Ruhllnâ San Francisco is a great
sporting town for its size, but 1 don't
think it is big enough to make it worth
the while of Jeffries and Sharkey to fight
here. In New York they would be sure
of a big attendance. Again, this is a lit
tle too far out for people to come. I don't
care where the men fight. I'll be there to
witness the bout and possibly challenge
the winner.
Frank McConnellâ lt's just the thing. It
would be a big card for this town, and do
a great deal toward giving the sport an
impetus. In my opinion the men them
selves would be benefited if they fought
here, as the climatic conditions are more
favorable for training. It will be excess
ively hot in the East about the time they
begin training for their contest and this
will surely affect their condition. No mat
ter where the men fight a crowd will
travel to see It. I think more people would
come West to see the go pulled off than
those who would travel to a hot center
like New York. It would be a splendid
thing if the big ones would settle matters
in California and I wish they would agree
to do so. Both are Callfornlans and if they
fought here every one with any sporting
blood ln his veins would save his dollars
to see the fight 01 the century pulled off.
I want it here and hope the purse is large
enough to tempt them.

CHAMPION JEFFRIES
REACHES THE COAST
Fitzsimmons' Youthful Conqueror Receives
a Warm Welcome at the Ferry.
The New Fistic Idol Says He Thinks Sharkey
Will Fight, and Tells Why He Is
Anxious to Meet the Sailor.
Jeff's here. The champ "has came" and |
the local colony, of "rubbernecks" is
happy. . '
The conqueror of Fitzsimmons arrived
in the city yesterday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock, reaching the Palace Hotel just
in time to open a telegram from Brady s
agent at New York, Informing him that .
he would have to sail- on the 27th inst. for |
London. Eng.. where, among other en- i
gagements, he is to don the mitts for
ten rounds with the irrepressible Charlie
Mitchell. *
The home-coming of the new champion
was the occasion for an ovation which
was not lessened by the fact that the
Southern Pacific managed to lay out the J
pugilist's party five hours longer than the
scheduled time. As early as 9 o'clock in
the morning a large crowd with caout- j
chouc in their cervex had collected at
the ferry depot to get a glimpse of Jet
fries. Credulous as are all "rubbernecks,
they placed absolute confidence even in
a Southern Pacific promise and believed
that company would hurry along the
champ on card time. Friends of the j
fighter, only a little better informed, be- .
gan dropping down toward the ferry de
pot from 10 o'clock on, led on by a rail- -
road bulletin that Jeff's train would make
up a couple of the lost hours. A brass
band engaged by Manager Sam Thall to .
lend eclat to the advent of. his attrac
tion joined the fast gathering throng and
until noon the friends, "rubbernecks" and
musicians scanned the faces .of off-coming
passengers without discovering the linea
ments of their Idol. A Southern Pacific
bulletin about this time, containing, the
information that the train would not ar
rive till 3:15 o'clock, dispersed the crowd
to lunch, which was interrupted fifteen
minutes later by another announcement {
that the boat bearing Jim would be In
at 1:15 o'clock.
It didn't get in till 2:30, but the crowd
waited and grew until there was not a
soul less than 5000 strung out with the â¢
band in front of the ferry depot. A larg i
number of local sports had managed to
make their way inside, bent on getting
handshakes from Jeffries before Hie
crowd surrounded him. Five hacks for
the pugilist and his party bad also been
driven in and awaited the coming of the
boat. Â«
It was spied at last making its way

lighter than he was when he left, weigh-

the road to Sacramento to meet him.
Tom Lindsay, Harry Corbett, Alf Siting
house. Alec Greggains, Ned Homan, Col
onel Brady and other well-known men
about town filled the other hacks.
Out of the same gates at tne eastern I
end of the ferry, through which Durrant
took his last hack ride into San Fran
cisco, Jeffries burst on the view of the
waiting crowd as the band struck up "A j
Hot Time." yell after yell went up and !
the champion, who was trying to conceal
his face behind a paper, for which he had
given a freckle-faced newsooy a handful j
of small change, modestly tipped his
straw.
The procession, headed by the band
tooting away for dear life, turned into
Market street, followed by all the thou- j
sands, cheering th*- man who had brought i
the belt back to San Francisco. For the i
fifteen minutes it took to march to the |
hotel street-car traffic was blocked, the
proud coachman driving Jeffries not being
able to see any one in it with himself. All j
along the line there were cheers, the
crowd constantly increasing. As the
backs headed for the Palace court there !

to a shout of welcome that shook the i
glass in the doors.
Jeffries hurried to the register to sign !

third floor, where he was soon busy shak- j

"It feels bully to get back," he said, the
glad smile on his face corroborating his
words. "I never feel quite right while
I'm away from California, and you bet
I'm glad to get home again. Say. but
it's hot back there. Why, those people
laugh at you when you tell them about
the climate out here. They think you're
filling them. Sure."
"You're looking fine. Jim." said one or
his friends. "I guess that Yale professor
didn't size you up right when he said you
were all burned out."
â¢'What, that fellow? I guess he didn't.
Why he never made an examination of
me That thing he sent out was pure im
agination. How could he tell anything
from the time he had? We were jus.
leaving the ball grounds at New Haven.
Conn., where I had umpired the game,
and was still in my tights after giving a
boxing exhibition, when a seedy looking
individual wearing a soiled looking cellu
loid collar came up and said he was Pro
fessor Beaver of Sale and wanted to ex
amine me. He said he had examined
many other athletes and wanted to get
mv measurements. That night we were
booked tor the New York Casino and
hadn't a minute to spare to make the
train. I explained that I would have been
willing to oblige the professor, but under
the circumstances could not. it meant
hundreds of dollars to me. I said, and I
didn't propose to lose them for an enure
stranger. He walked around muttering
and grumbling, and I finally allowed him
to measure mv chest. That's all he got
and if 'he can tell that a man burn.-ci
out' by passing a tape over a chest he s
entitled to the information."
In response to a remark that he looked
to be lighter than when he went East
the champion said he was.
"It's not all due to the heat, either,
he said, the twinkle in his eye matching
that of the big solitaire on his expansive
Â«h'rt front. "Some of it was clue to
Brady. â¢ He didn't do a thing but make
me work. I've been at it every day since
I've left here and even now. when I ar
rive and expect a rest. I get a telegram
from him that I must sail from Nov lork
on the 27th. or else all engagements will
be off 1 didn't want any European trip
and I told Brady so, but I guess he's gone
ahead and I'll have to follow suit.
Jeffries' information as to what is
ahead of him In England is as vague as
that of the general public. He is of the
I opinion that he will meet Mitchell in the
second week of August, and while it is
| evident that he does not look upon the
i contest as one to test his powers, he says
I he will train fully for it.
"I'll train for Mitchell," he said, "just
!as hard as I would for anybody else. I
I belli in being right. I have made up my
! mind to work hard in preparing for all
I mv lights, for if you don t work you can't
fight. I know at any rate the more work
', I do the better I fight."
"How long will you train for your fight
, with Sharkey," he was asked.
Ross O'Neal, who was near by. broke in:
â¢1 don't think he'll meet Sharkey, j It
was even money and no takers in New
York when we left that the sailor
wouldn't sign. They don't think he wants
to fight Jim." m _ _ .
"Oh, I guess he will." said Jeffries.
"He wants to fight all right. Some peo
ple think he don't, but I do, although I
chased him all over the East and broke
mv arm on Armstrong trying to get to
him. I want to meet him and get him to
1 make good some of the nasty things he
has said about me. I never said anything
bad about him, except maybe to some per
sonal friend, when I was hot at what
Sharkey was saying about me. All I want
| to do is get him to make his talk good.
I Outside the ring I'll treat him like any-
L body else."
A few minutes later, in speaking of
Fitzsimmons, Jeffries was telling what a
wonderfully strong, big man the Cornisn
man was. "He's a hard customer," he
said, "a good deal harder than Sharkey
; and he's a bigger man physically than
many people believe."
"No, I didn't hurt my hands on him,"
he said in response to a question. "I've
learned a trick or two to save them. I
. punch this way now." he continued,
showing his ' clenched fist with the
knuckles up. "and not this way (knuckles
1 to the side). I '.earned that from Tommy
Ryan. You can drop one of them on a
man before he knows it and the whole
: weight of your body goes with it. The
other way you telegraph your blows."
Jeffries denies cat he is anxious to
become an actor.
"When do you go on the stage?" he was
â¢ asked.
"When Brady tells me to," was his
: laughing reply, narrowly escaping a
mouthful of lather from the brush of the
j barber, who had managed by this time
to get the champ stretched on an arm
; chair in his bedroom, a pillow for a
headrest.
"I think the piece is called 'The Rough
Rider.' and I'm told I come in on a
1 burro."
And the fighter laughed so heartily at
I the conceit that the barber nearly landed
j an uppercut on the point of his jaw.
There was a continual stream of callers
In the room until 4 o'clock, the most
notable being Master of Every Prize Ring
Ceremony Billy Jordan, who had been

COLUMBIA WORTHY TO
DEFEND AMERICA'S CUP
Proves Her Superiority Over the Vander
bilt Yacht Defender.
After the Splendid Performance Experts Become
More Firmly Convinced That the Shamrock
Cannot Win the Trophy,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 6.â By the race be- I
tween the new cup defender, Columbia.,
and the old Defender, sailed to-day over j
a triangular course of thirty mil- ten.
miles to a leeâ has been plainly dem
ohstrated that, no matter bow skillfully j
constructed a yacht may be, her sailing
and ability to go to windward may be ;
killed by "imperfectly setting sails. !
The Columbia won the race by a mar
gin of 3 minutes, 53 seconds (unofficial |
time). There is no doubt she would have I
won by a larger margin If her sails had ,
fitted as well as the Defender's. In the
windward work, while the wind was
strong, the Columbia was unable to either ,
outfoot or outpoint the Defender, chiefly
on account of the bad set of her club :
topsail, jib topsail and forestaysail. She .
covered the first leg of ten miles to wind
ward three minutes faster than the De
fender, but one minute of that gain was
made when the wind became light and
less than two miles from the turning ]
point. On the second leg the Columbia ;
gained fifty-eight seconds. lt was a
reach, both yachts carrying large (not (
balloon) Jib topsails. On the last leg- j
close-hauled work in a light breezeâ she
lost five seconds to ;he Defender, this
probably by reason of a shift of wind
which favored the Defender.
In comparatively light winds the new
Iselin-Morgan yacht Colum. ia vanquished
the Vanderbilt yacht Defender, and con
vinced the yachtsmen wno saw the royal
struggle that she is worthy of defending
the precious trophy which Sir Thomas
Upton and his merry tars hope to take
back with them in the Shamrock next fall.
The Columbia's foresail and club top
slit are anything but perfect, and in a
general wav she will need a good deal of
tuning up. * Yet, based upon the showing
she made as a better boat than the De
fender, under adverse conditions, the
nautical sharpers in strongly convinced
that Sir Thomas will sail home without

lias given us the yachting supremacy of \

t'a "conditions anything but ideal for
vat-lit racing. The billows of mist which
enshrouded tho Jersey shore prevented
the crowd on the highlands of Naveslnk
and Sandy Hook from seeing the race, but
tic eveloping haze only added pictur
. soucness to the contest for those who
went outside in fancy crafts to see It. For
them the world was blotted out, and over
the dim gray sea. under the dull sky, the .
yachts raced, with nothing but them
selves and the attendant train of follow
ing boats to witness the contest.

that she is undoubtedly the Defender

hung over the harbor this morning when j

the waves hi the harbor that many craft
of many kinds ventured out to witness
the race, the large fleet including side
wheelers, swift steam pleasure yachts,
snubnosed tugboats and sailing crafts of
ail descriptions. They led, followed and
accompanied the racers. Small stickers,
slo.ps and schooners there were in pro
fusion. Fortunately they kept their dis
tance and few of them both*; red the racers
with wash or swell.
There was considerable delay at the
start The breeze had freshened as the
yachts got outside and what the old saits

Commodore Morgan's flagship the Cor
sair with Commodore Morgan, Chester
Griswold: ex-Commodore Nicholson Kane.
Rear Admiral Francis Hogglnson, Irving
Grinnell a.iv a large parly of; guests
aboard, had signaled the course and the
racers had cast off their lines, a sharp
rain squall killed the breeze. But the
squall was brief, and a half hour later â¢
a steady twelve-knot breeze was blowing
from the southwest. The Corsair signaled
the first leg to windward, down the Jer
scv coast, and the yachts began to jockey
for positions. Captain Barr had the tiller
of the Columbia and aboard with him !
were C. Oliver is.-lin. Mrs. Iselin, New
bury Thorpe; William E. Iselin, Herbert
\Y .Leeds and Woodbury Kane. < Japtii m
Rhodes had the helm of the Defender.
William Butler Duncan. Mrs. Duncan and
John O. Beresford were board of her.
As the warning Kan was lired. the Co
lumbia without waiting for the starting â 
gun rounded Sandy Hook lightship and
headed across the line. Either It was a |
bad blunder on the part of Captain Harr.
or it was designedly done to give the
Defender a start e*._ua 1 to her time al
lowance, which Is figured at about two
minutes. Just as the starling gun boomed
the Defender crossed on the port tack,
Meantime the Columbia jibed, and re- j
turning came about and headed for the
line crossing at exactly two minutes
after ih<* 1 >efender. Both yachts carried
four staysails' jibs, baby jib, topsails and ,
Club topsails: The boa to the windward
Clad*, a beautiful race. The Interest was
intense for th* first few minutes as the
big racers' with everything close hauled,
entered upon their "-- * of speed. Ihe j
Defender had the weather gauge by a i
hundred yards and was seven lengths
ahead. At first the Columbia seemed to
outfoot her rival, and there seemed to be
no perceptible difference In their ability
to hug tne wind. Nautical experts were
jubilant. Then both yachts went over on :
the starboard tack for a long leg. They
heeled until yards of their bronze bodies
were exposed. â : .'-.â¢;_
Tho Columbia seemed more tender than
tn. Defenderâ more tender, but peruana
more stately as she lav down to ncr work.
She heeled enough to let the seas swirl and
bobble along her lee rail, and sometimes ]
when she smashed a big wave Into tatters
she shipped some water forward.
Then the talent began to gel nervous.
Gradually but surely the Defender v. as
drawing ahead, and it was also apparent
that she was pointing higher than the
Columbia. it did not take the yachtsmen
long to discover the cause. The Defen- |
dor's sails fit to perfection arid every Inch j
of canvas drew. The club topsail or the
Columbia, on the other hand, was loose |
and cracked in the wind The fore stay- |
sail did not draw and might as well have .
been stowed In the locker below.
By this time the breeze was blowing j
about ten knots an hour, and while it j
continued at that clip the Defender con
tinued to gain very slowly, but also very
surely. Half an hour later the wind sank
to out live knots, and immediately the
sails of the Columbia began to draw ami
_.!:â¢â¢ began to gain upon her adversary.
Both skipper were now straining for the
mastery. Boih pinched until their head :
Bails trembled; they strove for ths
weather gauge. The Columbia continued I
to gain on every tack, and a few minutes
before the first mark was reached sho
crossed the Defender's bow en th*-* star
board tack. Then the nautical sharps ,
breathed easier. She rounded the stake
exactly on. minute ahead of the Defen
der. Ar- she fased her sheets and turned
the mark all the steam craft signaled
thir congratulations.
But here trouble with her headsails was !
sonspicuous. The yachts had stowed their I
i baby jibs and had sent up their big jib
i topsails In stops as they approached the
j stake, but the Defender, although the last
I around, broke out her big jib fully.a minute
i before the Columbia loosed hers, and then
j the latter had to be taken down and reset.
I On the long reach for the second mark.
; with the wind abeam, the Columbia
I gained fifty-eight seconds. About half
way down a black squall, which had been
I threatening to the southward, broke
! sharply and completely swallowed up the
I big yachts and their trains. It was now
i only a question of how much the Columbia
| would beat the Defender, and many of the
: steamers and tugs were headed back for the
| finish. When the rainfall ceased the wind
I hauled to the west and instead of running
home before the wind, with spinnakers
set. the yachts maude the last leg with the
! wind on the port bow. This was a grave
j disappointment for the spectators.
The wind gradually died, and when the
yachts were within about a fourth of a
mile of the finish the fleet gathered about
' the lightship and Commodore Morgan's
flagship. Gracefully and noiselessly the
Columbia swept over the invisible line
between them, and as she crossed she re
ceived a royal salute. Whistles shrieked
, and sirens .wailed. Five minutes the din
I continued.
| The Columbia made no response to this
! thunderous demonstration. As the De
| fender crossed the line she also was greet
ed with a demonstration quite as enthu
: siastic and prolonged. The yachts were
j immediately taken in tow by their tugs
and brought up the bay.
Herbert Deeds, on behalf of Mr. Iselin,
said after the race that the friends of the
Columbia were very well satisfied and
hoped to .'... better when their sails were
made more trim. He said there were no
accidents of any kind and the yacht would
leave for New R chelle to-morrow. But
ler Duncan said he had nothing to say for
the Defender. Everything had been satis
factory. The race was an informal trial
for a cup offered by the New York Yacht
; Club. The official trials will occur in
September.

LAKE FOREST, 111., July 6.â Three East
ern players and one Westerner will con
test In the semi-finals to-morrow for the
amateur golf championship. The games
to-day resulted In the defeat of John
Reid Jr., the intercollegiate champion, by
W. J. Travis of the Oakley Country Club;
Gardner G. Hubbard by Champion Find
lay S. Douglass; 11. P. Toler by H. M.
Harriman, and J. G. Thorp by Charles B.
Mac Donald. the sole survivor of the
Western golfers who started the week's
playing. The scores ln the game between
Douglass and Hubbard. Harriman and
Toler were rather one-sided, Douglass
winning seven up and six to play, while
Harriman*f*von six up and four to play.
Unless the form displayed by the play
ers to-day prove deceptive Findlay S.
Douglass will contest in the finals Satur
day. He meets W. J. Travis to-morrow.
Last year the two came together in the
sl-mi-flnals over the Morris country links,
Douglass winning nine up, even to play.
Douglass was far from perfect ln his
form to-day. but his medal score was bet
ter than that of Mr. Travis, and the gen
eral opinion is that Douglass will win.
As to who will be successful ln the match
between Mac Donald and Harriman opin
ion is evenly divided as they played
splendid golf to-day. MacDonald'.- play
was perhaps a shade the better. He ne
gotiated the first nine holes in the after
noon in thirtv-nlne, but fell away some
what when he had his game apparently
won. Harrlman's work, however, was
good throughout the game.

LOWERS THE TRACK'S MARK
â¢ â -
Special Dispatch to ThÂ«Â» Call.
NEW YORK, July The Brighton
Beach Racing Association opened its gates
to-day with several stakes on the card.
of which the Brighton handicap was the
feature. Imp. the fast Western mare who
won the Suburban, was the winner of the
Brighton handicap at a long price in the
fast time of 2:05 2-5, a new track record.
Ethelbert, the pronounced favorite and
winner of the Realization, was second un
der the wire, with Bangle in third place.
The track was in excellent condition.
For the Brighton handicap May Hemp
stead, the Western filly, was second
choice, with little to choose between Imp,
Bangle, Martimas and Maxine at long
odds. The start was good for all but
Bangle, and the Suburban winner Imp
was the tirst to poke her black muzzle In
front. Past the grand stand for the firct
time Imp was In front by half a length,
with KUielbert second, a nose in front of
Martimas. At the half pole the watches
showed .a 1-5 seconds, and Imp hid a
length to the good, with the others ilose
up in a bunch, going well within them
selves. Before the mile was reached
Ethelbert began slowly backing up, and as
they passed the mile post in the fast time
of 1:40 2-5 Imp showed not the slightest
distress. O'Leary not having moved on
her. Spencer was at work on Ethelbert,
and Bangle had worked his way into
fourth place. ,
O'Leary let out a link to the leader and
she took another length. But here Ethel
bert came with a rush and foot by foot
he was overhauling the flying leader. It
was not a rapid enough gain to suit Spen
cer and he drew his whip. As he loos*
his hold the Realization winner faltered
perceptibly, and while he might have not
won if Spencer had left the whip alone
he might have been a little nearer. The
crowd yelled frantically, for Imp is popu
lar with the masses, and as the watch
stopped at 2:05 2-5 It showed a new record
tor the track and very close to that of tho
distance on any -circular track.
The finish of the First Attempt stakes
was a hot one. Mesmerist, the favorite,
ran at the front of the lot to the last fur
long and looked a sure winner, when
Plucky, who had been running second,
came at him with a rush, wore him down

EXCITING CONTESTS IN
THE HENLEY REGATTA
Canadians Row a Very Game Race, but
Lose to the Sturdy Londoners.
Mishaps on the Thames Course Which Prevent
Some of the Oarsmen From Competing
in the Finals.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HENLET-ON-THE-THAMES, July 6.â
Despite a somewhat ominous morning
the crowd of the week attended the re
gatta to-day. the club landing house and
the house boats being centers of most
vivacious and picturesque groups of well
groomed men and women.
The American and Canadian contingent
was well represented, and hundreds of
transient visitors were present. A prom
inent figure was R. C. Lehman, who
coached the Harvard University crew for
two seasons, as he took his place to watch
the First Trinity eight, whom he had
trained. Masses of boats were on the
river, while the meadow swarmed with
coaches and wagonnettes. and the crush
on the isthmian reminded one of an
Easter parade on Fifth avenue.
American interest centered in the race
between the Canadian and the London
Rowing Clubs, which proved well worth
seeing. It looked like a good thing for
the visitors, but the old adage about
youth and its day came painfully Into
view again. The Canadians rowed a won
derfully game race, but the Londoners
certainly Improved as they went along.
Then Rudge stroked with great judg
ment and the advisability of Captain
Lowe in scratching his four in the Stew
ard's cup race was manifested. Some
people blamed him, but the result justi
fied the means. It was better to be in at
the death of one race than to be knocked
out twice In the second round.
The seventh heat of the diamond sculls
was an attractive event. The winner of
this race would qualify for the final of
this classical event. The fact that Hem
merde of the Le.inders had rowed so con
scientiously all through practice, making
his half-courses In times which ranged
between four minutes and four minutes
ten seconds, made him an adversary to be
reckoned with, It was thought that he
might make the Anglo-American row out
and so establish a new record. *
Nothing whatever marred the day s
sport until it was nearing the close. Then
occurred the first mishap. This was when
the bad steering of the Trinity College
four caused them not only to lose the
race, but to break their boat.
At the first attempt at a settlement
Cambridge fouled Magdalen. At the
next attempt Cambridge tried to carry
away a pile, but ended with a smashed
rigger. This was the end of a magnificent
quartet of oarsmen. They have no one
but themselves to blame. Had they kept
their heads it is more than probable they
would have got Into the finals, but the
trainer and coach proposed and the cocks
wain disposed. Taken as a whole, how
ever, the day's racing was voted most
satisfactory.
In the first heat of the Visitors' Challenge
Cud for four-oared crews, Pembroke beat iJal
-11., I.' Balllol was a length and a half ahead at

POSSIBILITIES OF
THE AUTOMOBILE
The Run pron) Paris to Rouen May
Lead to the Use of th)e Ma
chine by Tourists.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, July Electric automobilists in France feel that the recent
record of Comte Chasselop-Laubat between Paris and Rouen has gone
far to prove the possibilities of electricity as a motive power are very
great and that an important point has been reached in this branch of
automobilism. Hitherto partisans of petroleum machines have invari
ably replied to the electricians that without recharging stations all over
France, kept up at tremendous cost, it would be impossible to establish
electric automobilism on anything like a practical basis. The run to
Rouen, a distance of 136 kilometers, without recharging, opens up pos
sibilities of a far-reaching character.
Comte Chasselop-Laubat says: "There were only two persons in the
electric machineâ and Bourdeau. an engineer! The Michelin
Company provided my electric carriage, which was not built especially
for long trips, but, on the contrary, though a very powerful vehicle, was
really Intended for runs of a moderate length at high speed. The total
weight, not Including passengers, was something about 2000 kilos. The
four wheels of the vehicle are of equal size and measure one-eighth of a
centimeter in diameter. The tires are Idichelin's pneumatics of ninety
millimeters.
"The record I made without recharging, namely. 136 kilometers In
7 hours 15 minutes, should not be considered the extreme limit. 1 mean
to lower my own record and to construct a spiral electric carriage for
long trips. If in the near future we can have electric carriages which
will run about 200 kilometers at on* charge and at a decent speed, they
will certainly come into play for touring, as on French roads you find
cities where recharging is possible at distances below the figures I have
already used in practical proof."

His Dismissal From the

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, July 15-
Adjutant General Corbln announced to
day that President McKinley has ap
proved the sentence of dismissal Imposed
by the court-martial in the case of Cap
tain Neall, Fourth Unit*, d Stat* Cavalry.
John W. Mackay and Senator Stewart
interceded with the President and
War Department officials in behalf of
Captain N< all, but without avail.
It is understood that the President has
suggested a way in which Captain Neall
can redeem himself and regain ids com
mission in the army, and it is Implied that
the encouragement is given that he will
be favored should he accept the course.
This contemplates that he enlist in tie
ranks of the regular my and await pro
motion. Neall's friends, who have ex
pressed themselves, seem to regard this
with favor.
Lite shortaze of something like ?.wu
which got Neall into trouble has been
made up by his friends, so there is noth
ing charged gainst him by th. ('ov.-ni
ment except his conduct, and while the
circumstances could not be accented by
the "military authorities as palliating or
extenuating, yet not regarded officially
they offer an excuse for his acts.
While* the officials are conscious that
there was no criminal intent In a strict
sense, vet his acts amounted to a trans
gression of military laws and could not
Be excused.
Senator Stewart called upon General
Corbin to-day in the Interest of Captain
Neall, but only in time to be apprised of
the President's approval of the sentence.

men subjecting themselves to strain by
long runs, sprinting, racing, etc., without

The Jefferson Medical College laboratory
staff have for some time been making a

of professional wheelmen and others ad

usually within twenty minutes after long;

one of the symptoms of Brlght's disease.

Several of these have temporary albu

REPORTED MASSACRE OF
AMERICANS IN BRAZIL
Letters Contain Statements Which
Minister Bryan Is Asked to
Investigate.
WASHINGTON. July 6.â Secretary Hay
! has sent instructions to Minister Bryan
lat Rio and Consul Ruffln at Ascun-
I slon. Paraguay, directing them to make
' an Investigation of the reported massacre
: of an expedition, of which three Ameri
cans were members, on Xingu River in
Brazil. Little Is known of the fate of the
party, except what Is contained in a letter
! transmitted to Department of State by
'â¢â  the Brazilian Minister, from the Consul
i General of Belgium In New York, and a
letter received by the President from a
i correspondent of the Belgium Consular
officerâ a Belgian in Brazil. The letters
; forward newspaper clippings which state
1 that rumors are current of the murder of
'. a party by Sinas Indians of Brazil, and
the Belgian asks funds with which to
form a posse and" avenge the murderers.
No expectation is entertained by 'lie
State Department officials that Brazil
can be called upon to Indemnify the heirs
â¢of Americans reported killed, as they
probably knew when they started on their
exploration that they took their life in
their hands, and that the Brazilian Gov-
I ernment would not protect them.

BADLY BEATEN BY
BIS INDIAN WIFE
George Crmack a Vic
tim of Jealousy.
Special Dispatch to Th** a l!.
SEATTLE, Wash.. July 6.â George Car
mack, discoverer of the Klondike, came
near meeting his fate late to-night. It
was his hit-, powerful Indian wife who
caused the trouble, and had not assistance
arrived there Is no telling what would
have happened. < ".-,i mack Is in bed at one
of the principal hotels badly used up. and
despite the efforts of secrecy there is lit
tle reason to doubt that Mrs. Carmack,
urged on by jealousy, apparently un
founded, attempted her husband's life.
There is no question that she pounced
upon him as he entered his room and
gave him such a terrible beating that he
will bear the marks for days to come.
The hotel was in an uproar, and the po
lice had to be called in. No arrests were
made, and Mrs. ; Carmack promised to
quiet down and let her lord and supposed
mas - alone.
The only reason the people at the hotel
â  can give for the assault is that Mrs. Car
mack has become very jealous. One em
ploye said that he understood Mrs. ('ar
mack was afraid Mr. Carmack would de
sert her and take a white woman In her
place. Those who are not acquaint* d with
Indian life in Alaska cannot appreciate
the feelings of the Indian woman li such
, matters.
Carmack. according to the hotel people,
has not Riven his wife cause for lealousy.
Possibly he ma. have left her for a time
: while he was looking around the city, but
there is nothing to show that he ha.**
slighted her In the least.
The trouble to-night occurred after Car
mack had gone upstairs to his room. Th*
electric bell connected with his room
sounded in an irregular, tremulous man
ner. A bellboy answered it. and came
j down stairs with a White face and bulg-
I ing eyes. He had seen Mrs. Carmack do
ing her husband up. and he was satisfied
.there was murder In the air. The clerk
| ran up and ran down again and called
"Police!"
Two officers were hurried down from
headquarters. They pounced upon Mrs.
earmark, and that terminated the most
exciting fight the hotel has seen for a
long time.
Carmack Is in a terrible condition. His
cheek is reported cut open, but efforts to
find hi weapon used proved futile. His
throat I ore marks of fineers and his
trousers were cut nearly off him. He was
put to bed and no one allowed to see him.

to task for it. In the wordy altercation
which followed the white man struck the
negro. The latter became greatly enraged
and fought back, with the result that the
white man got considerably the worst of

FORTUNES BROUGHT DOWN
FROM THE KLONDIKE.

Fourteen Men Have Died at Copper
Center and Fifteen More Per

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Wash., July 6.â The two ex
treme results of the search for gold in
Alaska were presented in strong contrast
to-day when tie- steamer City of Topeka
arrived from the north. Miners from
Dawson walked down the gangplank
trembling under the weight of the gold
dust they carried. Miners from Copper
River followed staggering from physical
weakness and disease contracted in the
inhospitable north. The Klondlkers wore
new suits. "111..-, from Copper River were
still in the blanket clothes they wore when
they left civilization, and nearly every
one had a roll of blankets under his arm.
One poor Copper River miner from New
York landed without a cent. A Klondiker
hearing of his plight purchased for him a
ticket across tne continent with a sleep
ing car coupon and litted him out with
new clothes.
The 'i'opeka also brought details of the
drowning of tour men at Five Finger
Rapids. They were i,. Green, Seattle; H.
Moulin, Whidby Island, VVasn.; H. Ting
ley, Victoria. _.. C.. and William Hotf
man, Whidby Island, Wash. They were
going to Dawson en a scow, and when
they reached the rapids they became con
fused and lost control of the craft: The
strong current ran it against the rocks
and it broke to pieces. The four men
were unable to "swim. The Copper River
passengers numbered fourteen. They say
the Government relief party sent by Cap
tain A-bercr rabie into the interior did a
great deal of good and doubtless saved
many lives. Abercrombie is now some
distance up the Copper River, working
on the mail road to Yukon.
Purser R. C. Junes says that the Klon
dike! on. the TopCka placed In his care
about $200,000 In gold dust.
J. T. Kenyon, V. W. lleywood and Judge
Ostrander, who were perhaps the richest
men on board, had about 400 pounds of
dust between them.
Dr. Leroy S. Townsend, who has been
in charge of the hospital In the Copper
River district, arrived to-day. He went
into the Copper River country in Febru
ary. 1898. He confirms previous reports
Of fatalities In that section and gives the

properties, and which licenses by subse
quent legislation were canceled "and the
holders deprived of all existing property
ownership or developing privileges, are
banding together and collecting necessary
proofs to warrant the State Department
prosecuting claims for damages. The ag-
Riegate demand will exceed three million
dollars. The miners think their claims
for damages have far more merit than
did thai of the British Columbia sealers.
Ex-Congressman Colonel James Hamil

Alaska, an important shipping point be
tween here and St. Michael, arrived to
day. A correspondent of the Associated
Press writes under date of June 19 as fol
lows:
There are five vessels in port bound
north to St. Michael and Cape Nome. The
Roanoke of the North American Trans
portation and Steamship Company was
the first to reach port after one of the
smoothest voyages ever made at this
time of the year. A dense bank of fog
kept her outside the entrance to this pic
turesque harbor twenty-four hours, Cap
tain aver laying to rather than take
any chances of piling upon the rocks,
which are numerous outside the heads.
The only vessel In port when the Roanoke
arrived was the steam schooner Del

pany. She will get away within a day or
two" for Cape Nome and St. Michael. Th.
Portland, from San Francisco, got in dur

REPORT OF THE ISTHMIAN
CANAL COMMISSION
It Will Not Be Prepared Until
Toward the Close of the Next
Session of Congress.
WASHINGTON. July 6.â There Is little
prospect of the report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission being ready for Con
gress early in the next session. At a
meeting to-day the commissioners dis
cussed the matter of time of departure
for the isthmus, and while no conclusion
was reached the general disposition was
not to go to Nicaragua until the end of
the rainy season. This would probably
keep them in the United States until
about November.
Engineer parties are to he sent down
In advance, however, and much prelim

so th.t the report can be prepared with
comparative! j* little delay- after the re
turn of the commission in the winter.
Even with this preliminary work, how
ever, it will probably be well toward the
close of the congressional session before
the report can be completed.

Hugh Lagan, who was recently promoted
to the pastorate of Sacred Heart parish,
departs for San Francisco on the 13th
inst. he will carry with him a token of
esteem on the part of the citizens of this
community that will do much toward
lightening the arduous duties In- will be
called upon to perform in his new field
of labor. Without regard to religious lines
the people have determined that the broad
and liberal minded priest shall receive
proper recognition of the services he, has
rendered to humanity while pastor of fat.
Raphael's, and preparations are now be
ing made to that end. . â _'..â 
Last evening a number of representative
men gathered at the residence of Dr.
W J. Wickman and took the initial
step toward expressing their appreciation
of what Father Lagan has accomplished
in his chosen walk of life. Among those
present were: Prison Director James H.

a resolution expressing the esteem in
which Father Lagan is held and the wish
that he may prosper in his new field. The
liberal bent of mind which has so en
deared him to the community in general
and made the clergy of all denominations
his friends will be mentioned and special
attention will be drawn to the power for
good exercised by the priest in dealing
with the unfortunates confined in San
Quentln Prison.
On Wednesday evening next the resolu
tion, handsomely engrossed, will be pre
sented to Father Lagan at the Hall Ra

who has not yet been selected, probably
Judge Angellotti. At the conclusion of the
exercises the priest will be presented with
a magnificent testimonial, the exact na

hinted that It will be of a more substantial
nature than mere resolutions.

are to be set free. The Spanish
commissioners sent to negotiate !
with Aguinaldo have arranged i
terms upon which all the captives j
will be released, and it remains
only for the Spanish Government I
and General Otis to give their ap- I
proval. A striking incident of the
conclusion of the negotiations
was the return to Manila of the
few brave Spaniards who held the
town of Baler so long against the j
natives â the only Spaniards in j

render of the Spanish prisoners I
in the hands of the Filipinos returned i
here last night.
Chairman Del Rio of the commission â¢
said the release of all the prisoners had
been practically arranged for. but it
would be necessary to consult the Span- 'â 
ish Government before the agreement
could he ratified. He declined to give
the terms of the arrangement, or to
say whether these contemplated a ran
som. He asserted, however, thai Agui
naldo had already issued a decree for
the release nf the civilian officials and
the sick soldiers.
The commissioners, with the remnant
of the Spanish garrison of Baler on the
east coast of Luzon and a number of
civilian prisoners, were escorted by
Filipino soldiers from Tarlac to the
American outposts at San Fernando
and came to Manila by the night train. |
The heroes of the long defense of Ba- j
Jer. v here the Spaniards resisted an in- j
surgent siege for more than a year, |

ant Martin, the only surviving officer. :
marched them through the streets.
There are only twenty-two. and most of
them mere hoys, in faded blue cotton]
uniforms and red shirts. They are
barefooted.
A crowd of Spanish men and women:
embraced them, weeping and shouting
their praises. They tell a remarkable
story. It appears that the captain sev
eral times proposed to surrender, but
the soldiers refused. Finally some
months ago he tried to raise a white'
flag. Thereupon Lieutenant Martin
killed him with his own sword.
Their food supply -.aye out entirely a
week ago. and they surrendered to the
Filipinos with all the honors of war.:
They were allowed to keep their arms. I
and say they marched from Baler with
a Filipino escort and carrying guns

everywhere being cheered and feted.
The Commissioners report that the

ROBERT BONNER'S
CAREER IS CLOSED
ROBERT BONNER.
NEW YORK. July '".. â Robert Bonner, publisher of the New York Ledger and
owner of fan."':.- horses, died at his home in this city at 7:10 to-night.
Mr. Bonner had been 111 for some months, yet was able to be about until
about ten days ago. Death was due to a general breaking down of the
system. There were with him when he died Robert Edward Bonner and Fran
cis Bonner, his sons: Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Bonner, son and daughter-in-law,
and Mr. and Mrs. Francis Ford, daughter and son-in-law.
Mr. Bonner enjoyed remarkable health until a year ago, when his life-long
friend. Rev. Dr. John Hall. died. A second shock to him was the death of his
son, Andrew Allen Bonner, on December 27 last! After this Mr. Bonner's tem
perament changed completely. He made fewer trips to -his magnificent farm
near Terry town, and contented himself with a short drive daily.
A week ago Tuesday he took his last drive, on his return home his case
was so serious that several doctors were called In for consultation with his
family physician. Dr. Munii. He became much worse on the following day and
since then took no nourishment. He lost consciousness early this morning and
remained in that condition to the end.
Robert Bonner was born near Londonderry, Ireland, A^ril 28. 182.. His par
ents were Scotch-Iris.. Presbyterians. He came to the United States and learned
the printer's trade. In 1839 he was employed in the office of the Hartford Cour
ant. where he gained the reputation of being the most rapid compositor in Con
necticut.
In I*> 44 he removed to New York, and in 1851 purchase., the Ledger, at that
time an insignificant sheet. By printing the. most popular class of Interesting sto
ries, he gave the paper a wide circulation, which was further extended by the
contributions of Fanny Fern. Edward Everett Hale, Henry Ward Beecher and
ether eminent authors and clergymen.
Mr. Bonner made large gifts of money to Princeton College and to various
charities. To gratify his taste for fast horses he purchased several of the most
celebrated trotters in the world, but withdrew them from the racecourse. Among
the horses owned by him were Peerless. Rarus, Dexter. Startl.- and Maud S, which
he purchased with a record of 2:09%', and afterward reduced .o'-2:o_*4 : from Wil
liam H. Vanderbilt for $10,000.
Mr. Bonner never took any interest in pacing horses. Mr. Bonner retired from
active business about twelve years afro. Riving* his paper to his three sons, one
of whom. Andrew Allen, died on December 27 last.

the mouth of the Brazos, which point
the flood reached to-day. The town
may be cut off from communication
with the world for a day or two, but
no loss of life is anticipated, because
the people had two days' notice that
the flood had broken loos.- above and
was coming down. The revenue cutter
Galveston will leave here to-night for
Velasco to rescue those really in danger
at that point.
The donation of the war rations was
most timely, as several thousand home

RAILROAD TRAFFIC
BLOCKED BY FLOODS
ST. LOUIS, July 6.â A special to the
Republic from Dallas. Tex., says:
The railroad situation in Texas to
night because of floods is so much
worse than it has been heretofore that
the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe had to
abandon its through trains from St.
Louis and Kansas City at Dallas and
Fort Worth respectively. The Santa
Fe until to-night, by running on a
roundabout way, managed to get
through to Galveston, but the new
washouts in the lower Brazos river
country stopped even this traffic. The
abandonment of the Santa Fe trains
severs the last link nf anything like di
rect connection between Northern and
Southern Texas. To reach these points
nmv it is necessary to travel via
Shreveport, La.
The flood damage to railroad property
is now conservatively estimated at
53 000,000.

LOSS OF LIFE IN
THE SWIRLING WATERS
. . .... - . . . .
ST. LOUIS. July 6.â A special to the
-Dispatch from Dallas. Texas,
says: At 11 a. m. to-day a. short dis
patch was received from a lineman at
Dewey, just across the Brazos River
from Sealey. It read: "River falling
slowly since 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon. Conditions here terrible. Every
thing in the country swept away.
Large number of lives lost in bottoms.
Looks like starvation for those left.
Situation not been exaggerated. Sev
eral days before line repairs can be
made with anything like system."
This telegram was received over a
wire spliced from the Missouri. Kansas
and Texas Railway and the Postal
Telegraph Company's lines, and is the
first that has been working into Sealey
and Dewey for three days. The wire
only worked five minutes and was then
lost. Efforts to connect since have
failed.
Shortly after this information was re
ceived by wire Deputy Sheriff Swearin
gen at Sealey said over the long-dis
tance telephone:
'â¢There is no Improvement In this sec
tion of the flood district. If anything
the situation is going worse. No re
lief boats have yet reached here from
Houston or Galveston. Sealey and
neighboring towns have about ex
hausted their resources for relief.
Another negro family was seen from
here drowning out from land about two
miles this morning. Several live-; have
been lost since last night among the
refuges on 'the mound' near old San
Felipe. A number of negroes fell into
the water from treetaps from sheer ex
haustion, after hanging three days and
nights. yy^ y^y

estimate of the number of people on their , (
way i" this city, but Dr. Irwin Shepard,
secretary of the National Educational As

probable that as many more visitors will ,
arrive, attracted by the low railroad
rates. The number already here is not
known, as the majority of the arrivals |
have not yet registered. |
The regular trains over the Santa J. c |

SOUTHERN PRISONERS
DEAR TO GAGE'S HEART
Marked Favoritism Shown in Re-
storing the Right of Citi
zenship.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON*. July 6.â
Shortly before Warden Aguirre was form
ally elected to succeed W. 1-:. Hale as the
head of the penitentiary Governor Gage
and party were taken through the insti
tution and its practical working features
shown to him. At that time Gage mani
fested his acquaintance with a remark
ably large number of tin- inmates and
frequently was drawn to one aide by some
prisoner and a whispered consultation
was held, In some cases lasting several
minutes. After the party left those con
victs with whom the Governor had spoken
appeared, for some reason or other, to he
in happy frames of mind, and some even
stated that their future lot was going to
be lighter than formerly.
This incident has often been recounted,
on account of a knowledge of the fact
that all the convicts who spoke to Gage
were from the southern part of the State.
The first substantial proof that Gage in
tends showing favors to prisoners from
the south now comes to light.
Over thirty of the Inmates are scheduled
to leave the prison this month, and among
this number the rights of citizenship will
1,.. restored to five by the gubernatorial
dictum. One of the lucky ones will be
Peter Derrenbecker, who has served a
teen-year term from San Diego for as
sault to murder.
The law prescribes, among other things,
that the rights of citizenship shall not be
restored to a discharged convict unless
his behavior shall have been exemplary,
and the record of Derrenbecker shows
plainly that, judged by this rule, he would
have to suffer. About three years ago
the man was paroled and permitted to re
turn to Pan Diego. His behavior was
such that in a short time he was reported
to Warden Hale, who went to San Diego
to bring him back to the penitentiary.
Derrenbecker was drunk and disorderly
several times while out on parole anil
finally made a vicious assault upon a per
son with whom he. had a disagreement.
It was this assault which caused his pa
role to be revoked.
The Warden took the convict In hand.
and upon his promise that he would con
duct himself in a decent manner on the
trip to San Quentln he was not hand
cuffed. While the train was â  passing
through the San Joaquin Valley Derren
becker crawled through a window, jumped
to the ground as the train was leaving a
station and made his escape. He was re
captured after a search lasting two days.
THREE MEN ASSAULT
AND ROB A FARMER
One of Them Admits His Quilt, but
Says It Was a Drunken
Freak.
SANTA ROSA. July ftâ John Shoebart.
a well-known farmer residing a few miles
north of Healdsburg, while returning
home late last night was assaulted by
three young men and robbed of about $75
in gold. Shoebart had been spending the
evening in town, and it is said had been
drinking. The assault occurred right at
the edge of town and near Gobbls' winery.
Shoebart. who was riding on horse bacic,
was knocked from his horse into the road,
it is claimed, with a picket wielded by
one of his assailants. After recovering
consciousness, Shoebart returned to town
and reported the affair to the officers
This afternoon Constable J. < '. Ingalls
arrested Jim Crockett and Forrest Gully
at Healdsburg and charged them with the
crime. Later in the day Deputy Sheriff
C. A. Mason arrested Jesse E. Hiatt. who
has been employed during the last few
months at the Union Hotel in Healds
burg.
As he was leaving on the train. Hiatt
was brought to this city and interviewed
by Sheriff Grace. After some questioning,
Hiatt admitted his complicity in the case
and also implicated the other two. He
claims that all had been drinking, and
that the amount taken by Gully and
Crockett was but $40. He says that when
he became sober he tried to get the other
boys to sec Shoebart and square matters,
but they would not do so.

AT HIS POST.
Congressman Roberts Made the Ob
ject of a Bitter Personal Attack
by Dr. Paden of Salt
Lake.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DETROIT, July 6.â Both of the great
main tents owned by the United Society
of Christian Endeavor were used to-night
for the first time during the eighteenth
international convention, and contained
their full quota of 10,000 people. Hundreds
of others who failed to secure admittance
patiently occupied "standing room" all
around the outer edges.
Many visiting delegations from long
distances came in to-day. swelling the
number of stranger delegates beyond the
20,000 mark. The convention days are es
sentially days of song. Although to-night
the choir was divided between the., two
tents there seemed little diminution in the
volume of song or tin- numbers of singers
in each. ' As -for the audiences, their spir
itual enthusiasm expanded with the pass
age of the hours. Yesterday there was
little street enthusiasm. To-day the En
deavorers honored th.- invitation of the
Mayor of Detroit to sing. Street car loads
of them frequently .spun along the streets
singing as they went. Many groups sang
by the wayside, aside from those who
joined the squads of noonday workers in
business houses and factories. They sang
-it the afternoon rallies and sang this
evening en route to the night gatherings-
Bang with redoubled vigor after again as
sembling, and then sang on their way
Ten thousand people crowded into the
tent "Willlston" for this evenings exer
cises President Clark presided over the
meeting and P. S. Foster of Washington
was musical director.
The two principal addresses in lent Wil

J. P. CARROLL MAY BE
STOCKTON'S FIRE CHIEF
Lively Squabble for the Patronage of
the Fire and Police Com
mission.
STOCKTON. July 6.â The new Board of !
Police and Fire Commissioners are hav
ing a hard time passing out the paltry |
patronage at their disposal on account of
the numerous Democrats who are willing
to serve the city. The board as appointed
by Mayor Harrison is composed of John j
T. Doyle, H. R. McNoble, Democrats, and j
Jacob Simon, a nominal Republican, but
who is said to have supported more Dem- |
ocrats than Republicans at the late ]
municipal election. The Democratic work
ers are urging the commission to make a i
clean sweep in the police ami fire depart
ments and the commissioners would un
doubtedly like to do so, but are restrained
by public sentiment. The push is deter- j
mined to carry their point, however, and ]
secure the removal of Chief Israel Rolf
of the fire department. Rolf has been in
his present position ten years and has
brought his department up to a high
standard of efficiency, conducting it eco
nomically and upon a strictly non-parti
san basis. Unless the slate is broken
James* p. Carroll Is to take Rolfs place.
Carroll, while having many friends, is
known as a persistent seeker after office
and nas succeeded in keeping himself at !
the public crib for nearly fourteen years, j
Last yeai he wanted to be Sheriff, but
was defeated and since then he has had
his eye out for something new. Finning
that he could not beat John D. Gall for
Chief of Police he concentrated his fignt
for Rolf's place and is said to be in the
lead. Ho has never been connected with
a modern lire department in any capacity
and .here Is little wonder that property
owners stand aghast at such a move on
the part of the commission. Heretofore,
regardless of the political complexion of
the commission, public sentiment has se
cured the retention of Rolf, but it is not
believed that property-owners will be
listened to this 'time.
The re-election of John D. Gall will give
general satisfaction. Chief Gall has made
a creditable record, winning the confi
dence of the people and the respect and
good will of his officers.
M. H. Kingsbury, who was Chief of
Police under the A. P. A. administration
and now captain by appointment from the
Democratic-Republican fusion regime, I
wishes to succeed himself, but his selec
tion will please the rank and file of no
party or faction. Th? opposition to him Is
not upon persona] grounds, but for the j
reason that his political opinions and as- j
sociations change with the seasons. The
commission tried to settle its troubles at '
a meeting last evening, but there was a
hitch somewhere, followed by an adjourn
ment. The politicians have now redoubled
their efforts to smash or strengthen the
slate according to their desires.
ACCUSES EARL
FRUIT COMPANY
Chad bourne's Version of
the Crata Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN. July 6.â Fred A. Chadbourne,
one of the board of directors of the Fruit
Growers' Association, to whom the Earl !
Fruit Company refused to sell crate:,
when an application was made for the
same, has authorized the statement that
when the Earl Fruit Company was given
permission to occupy the Suisun Valley
Fruit I'nion warehouse here it was agreed ;
that the company would furnish box lum- I
ber to all growers.
A tew days previous to June 28 j
Chadbourne applied to the Earl Fruit
Company for box lumber. No question.
were asked regarding the purposes for
which he required the same, whether for j
Eastern shipment or shipment to San :
Francisco, On the 26th Cnadbourne at- i
tended a meeting of the Fruit Growers'
Association at Sacramento. Two days
afterward he went to the Earl Fruit Com- ;
pany's agent for crates and the agent ab
solutely refused to supply them to him. ,
Chadbourne was advised to get crated
through a second party, viz., the Alden
Anderson Company, but he repudiated
this method of doing business in this way
and solicited the aid of another paity.
Chadbourne claims that the Earl Fruit I
Company does not pay a dollar of rent
for the ' warehouse occupied by it and !
owned by the Suisun Valley orchardir.ts.
He has receipts in his possession showing
that the Earl Fruit Company sold him
lumber previous to the 2Sth. and that the
action of Its agent that day was a posi
tive refusal to meet his demands. He
further contends that the agent never t
asked him for what purpose he required '
the crates. Chadbourne makes this state
ment to refute Earl's version of the affair i
in to-day's paper.

a
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BINGHAMTON, N. V.. July 6.â An au
topsy was held this morning on the body
of Rabbi Louis Ginsburg, who died last
night" from a knife wound, which corrob
orated the claim of Dr. Forker, who per
formed the remarkable operation of sew
ing a wound in the heart.
Rabbi Glnsburg lived for forty hours
after the wound in the heart was sewed
up, and death was due to septic inflamma
tion of the pericardium rather than from
loss of blood, for Dr. Porker's operation
had entirely stopped the hemorrhage. The
autopsy showed that one wound passed
almost entirely through the abdomen, be
tween the stomach and left lung, through
which a long slit was cut. the knife blade
passing through the pericardium and en
tering the wall of the heart at the lett
ventricle, and lacking but an eighth of an
inch of passing through the heart wall,
which in that place was a trifle over half
an inch thick.
When Dr. Forker reached the place
after the tragedy he found the rabbi
nearly dead from loss of blood. During
the operation he transfused into the man's
veins about three quarts of saline solu
tion to take the place of the lost blood,
ami kept up life. It was then necessary:
to cut off one of the ribs and push back
two others in order to get an opening to
perform the operation. Then, in spite of
the flow of blood. Dr. Forker took three
stitches in the heart and stopped the
hemorrhage.
The autopsy revealed the stitches in the
heart, just* as Dr. Forker claimed.

BACTERIOLOGICAL TRUTH-
DR. J. HENRY BARBAT, a member of the San
Francis Board of Health and the private
physician of Daniel Burns, is the brother ot
Dr. William F. Barbat, who recently antagonized
the Federal quarantine officer in the case of the
Nippon Maru, the Japanese steamship. It seems that
two Japanese sailors were suspected of having died
irom the bubonic plague, one of the most terrible
diseases known in the world. Dr. Kinyoun, indorsed
by the United States and the acting Federal quaran
tine officer, after having duplicated an original lumi
gation ot the vessel at Honolulu, and after having
subjected its passengers to a rigid investigation at the
Federal quarantine station at Angel Island, became
convinced that there was no danger of the communi
cation of the bubonic plague to the crowded popula
rtion of San Francisco, and, on behalf of the Fed
. ~ â¢ i i ii _ : .1
eral Government, withdrew all opposition to the
. . . â¢ :; V i 1 i- 'â  r 'â¢"
docking of the steamship and to the landing of it?
passengers.
But Dr. William F. Barbat was not satisfied. He
availed himself to the fullest extent of tlie opportunity
for bacteriological analysis. He determined to sub
ject the bacilli taken from th.- glands of the Japanese
sailors, whose bodies had been providentially found
near Fort Point, to scientific demonstration. After he
had collected the bacilli from the swollen glands he
instituted "culture--," by which the ultimate fact was
to be developed. When the development was per
fected bubonic possibilities were suggested, but the
i â¢ r i . t
alternative ot consumption was also presented.
Now tlie fact is that on this peninsula, with its sum
mer winds, with its pure and bracing atmosphere,
there is not a single element for the fertilization of
bubonic germ-. Of that form of acute disc.-: there
is hardly a possibility of development on this coast.
â. -r. ", '. -â '= '" '-â "; ' rr- * m â¢ â¢ .- i â¢
The Federal quarantine officer was fully justified in '
his reassuring conclusion.
But the bacteriological assistant to the Board of i
Health, although perhaps unconscious of the impor- ,
tance of his contribution to the science of the day,
was also right. The' Board of Health, as at present
characterized, owes its existence to the Huntington !
monopoly, operating for the moment through the
Governor of the State. For thirty years it has been \
a subject of intense interest to our people to deter
mine the peculiar form of bacilli through which the
autocratic power of Mr. Huntington has been so
frequently and so triumphantly asserted. That germs
or bacilli or bacteria pervaded the air and reached the
glands of politicians, wherever the railroad monopoly
operated, has been an evident fact, comprehended by
every citizen who felt the desire for material develop
ment or moral salubrity. But there has been a great
lack of precision in the diagnosis of the disease. It
has been actually essential to the public health that
some man should arise possessed of the technical
knowledge and the scientific experience that would
enable him to unravel the mystery and bring it within
popular comprehension.
Dr. William FA Barbat. the bacteriologist of the
Board of Health, is the Nathan for whom Mr. Hun
tington lias waited. He has solved the problem of a
generation. The disease from which California has
so long suffered is the railroad form of the bubonic
plague, innocuous in a merely physical sense, but ma
terially, intellectually and morally consuming. The
extent to which the railroad germ has preyed upon our
substance is beyond the conception of ordinary Amer-
icans. But the "cultures" of Dr. Barbat will exalt the '
people out of their customary ignorance. They will
observe how, upon an almost infinitesimal point, the
bacilli can swarm, and will realize that even sanitary
precautions may be applied to spread a disease that
is not only Asiatic, but imperialistic;
The Board of Health is swelled with monopolistic
importance. Dan Burns walks up and down, behind
the scenes with a flatulent consciousness of power that
attracts general admiration. But Dr. William F. Bar
bat is the scientific hero of the occasion, and to his
bacteriological discoveries the honors are due.
The Corrigan crowd has hopes that, if the new or
dinance allowing coursing in this city goes into effect,
they can operate their track at Ingleside. They have
a lot of "dogs" they would like to run against the
people's money. . ky:-'
THE ADMINISTRATION.
THE Portland Oregonian, one of the ablest
papers in the Union, seems to have lost patience
with the administration and has turned upon it
with a vigor that must be attributed to a very deep
conviction or to an attack of temper unusually severe.
The Oregonian lias favored Governor Roosevelt's
idea of proper Americanism, which is that we must
have war continually upon our hands as an urgency
to the "strenuous life" which the hero of the Rough
Riders regards as necessary.
; The Oregonian now complains that President Mc-
Kinley has no policy, that he is guilty of indecision '
! and seems to prefer to follow public opinion rather
! than create and educate it. All this makes a serious
| indictment, but perhaps its severity may be miti-
I gated by a little examination of the facts. The Presi- j
| dent and all thoughtful men in the country foresaw
' the results of a war with Spain and sought, with i
honor, to avoid it. Mr. Mooreiield Storey, early in 1896,
showed a clear vision when he said that the republic .
could endure any reverse, misfortune or disaster,
but that our free institutions would probably not sur
vive victory in a foreign war. The President compre
hended this clearly. Its truth is becoming daily more ;
and more apparent. The Oregonian is an imperialist
organ and favors expansion into the tropics and the |
ruling there of subject races. The same political
sovereignty cannot have both citizens and subjects !
under its Hag for a long period. All will become sub- I
jects or all will become citizens. There is no half
way ground. As a result of the Spanish "war about
twenty millions of tropical people have been brought
within the zone of imperialism. They have been ex
ploited by more than one European nation, princi- .
pally by Spain, and always to the loss, deterioration, .
degeneration, depletion and weakening at home of the
Government that controlled them. They effected the
final ruin of Spain, a power which at the time of their
acquisition was as great as England is now, and with
as widespread domain.
Whatever the absolutism of flic home Government,
the colonial establishment was always worse, and |
those who were trained in its administration, when j
they returned home carried with them the intolerance
and tyranny acquired in bearing the white man's bur- j
den in the colonies, to tincture the domestic admin
istration with autocratic ways.
That the effect will be the same upon us no rea
sonable man doubts. That the physical and moral
and political poison, generated in ruling subjects in
the tropics, will weaken the free purpose of our peo
pie is beyond question. That we buy them as sub
jects or take them as the spoil of war against our
solemn pledge is such a departure from every proper
purpose and aim of a republic as to appeal to all who ;
choose to think. Having held them as subjects, they
can never be promoted to citizenship. Subjection is
no school in which to learn self-government.
Turn which way you will the problem is black with
disaster. Now the President may well hesitate. He
may well falter. He may well pause in the hope that
the organs of public opinion, the upholders of con
stitutional freedom, will turn again to the true policy
of the republic and lead the people to follow.
If we may assume to advise the Oregonian we will
venture to suggest that it turn from the path it has
already followed too far and uphold the President in
respecting the oath he has taken to support the con
stitution. Let it declare that a free man shall hold
no slaves and a free Government shall rule no sub
jects, and stick to it. and the President will soon ap
pear to it to have a policy that conforms to the pre
cepts of liberty.
The American people must in this matter set them
selves right, for no one will do it for them. The
European powers, ], rig jealous of our progress, have
desired that we take upon us 'the handicap and clog
of national ambition and the fatal thirst for glory.
We have already done things in outrage of inter
national law and comity which they would not have
tolerated in one of themselves. The Filipinos and
Cubans and Porto Ricans will turn in vain to Europe
for a champion of their rights. The more we dis
respect those rights and violate our word the better
pleased is Europe. Will the ' Iregonian help the
American people to right themselves?
UNIVERSITY SALARIES.
HERETOFORE strikes for higher pay and
shorter hours have been confined to handi
craftsmen and laborers. Literary workers,
teachers, professors, lawyers and doctors have never
struck. True, some of these classes fix the rates at
which their services may be had. but law and medical
societies have never been known to expel a member
for taking less or getting more than the regular scale.
Now there really appears to be a strike on among
university professors and presidents. There have |
been three conspicuous presidential vacancies to fill
in this country, Yale, lowa and California, and the
official boards of the institutions concerned have
pursued the elusive presidential timber over a thorny
path. As a rule State universities, depending upon
political control and shaken by every party change,
are treated with marked parsimony. Those which had
the Federal endowment do not derive from it the
revenue it should have yielded. The lands given to
these institutions should have been leased, and not
sold. But the anxiety of educators for higher train
ing, and the pride of the people in all things con
ducive of culture, compelled the sale of the lands in
order to make a foundation and have a university as
quickly as possible.
The ill effects were not immediately felt. Money
commanded a high rate of interest and university
funds were loanable at 10 per cent. The interest de- '
rived was not an accretion to the original fund. Had
States been patient and cherished their endowments
they would have in a measure repaired the harm done
by the untimely sale of lands for an average of five
dollars per acre that would now bring an average of
fifty dollar?. But the interest was in no case added
to the principal, and as the demands upon these
schools have increased nearly all have been severely
pinched to keep up appearances. Their only re
course is to State Legislatures for more money, and
there they find themselves herded with State fairs,
appropriations for soldiers' monuments and medals,
the demands of penal and eleemosynary institutions
and the many other trembling victims of partisan
promises to be economical with the taxpayers' money.
Experience has shown it to be easier to snub a State
university than a State prison. The mild-mannered
professors, whose wives struggle along in made-over
garments and hover in insufficient shelter their brood
of big headed and flat-chested children, grow old
hoping in vain for a salary that will make ends meet,
while the lusty politicians, who lard the lean earth
with the fat gained on prison patronage, at once, take
a Legislature by the throat and, in their slang, make
it "cough up."
Now there seems to be a movement, perhaps not
planned nor preconcerted but surely afoot, among
scholars to compel an advance in presidential and
professional pay.
There are many colleges and universities in this
country. If ten did the work now done by hundreds
there would be only ten presidents, but as many pro

fessors, tutors and coaches as now, and they would
get as large salaries as the average now paid to presi
dents. : r
For many years lowa thought $3000 a year to her
university president - a sumptuous compensation.
Now, to fill a vacancy caused by death, she has ad
vanced it to $6000, with $250 traveling expenses, and
no takers. Illinois is holding Draper with $7000 and
a house heated and lighted. Wisconsin keeps Adams
with the same pay and perquisites. Minnesota, in
the honeymoon of her possession of a university, paid
the highest salary in the West. $6000, but the wolf
has long been at her door and the salary fell one-half.
It has now been raised to $7500 because it was re
ported that California had offered Xorthrup $10,000
to come to the coast. Chicago University pays
Harper $r2.000 out of its immense private endow
ment. California has been bulling the price of presi
dents, and the result will be that the deficiency in
Berkeley's treasury is likely to have company in many
an Eastern institution that has been compelled to put
up salaries because of California's offer.
...... . T
It is said by the lowa regents that four men under
40 years of age refused to look at the lowa vacancy
at $7000. Galesburg has lost Finley, an Illinois
farmer's boy, who goes to edit the Harper publica
tion, recently . sold to Doubleday & McClure, at a
salary of $7500. Altogether it looks as if the reviews
and magazines, by competing for the best trained
talent, have not only made university presidents
scarce and high-priced, but have opened a very
profitable field for thoroughly educated men who
have the gift of literary construction and criticism.
From the standpoint of a man of the world there is
only approval at this participation of scholars in the
wave of prosperity. They have always given to the
world more than it handed back, and it is time to
equalize.
STREET-PAVING PROBLEMS.
WITH good reason most of the space of the
current number of the Merchants' Association
Review is given up to the report upon "Street
Taxing in Eastern Cities," made after personal inves
tigation by L. M. King, superintendent of the asso
ciation. The report is not confined to statements of
fact concerning Eastern paving, but applies the re
sults of the experience there to the paving problem
in San Francisco, and is, therefore, of more than
ordinary value.
After a general review of the kinds and qualities of'
pavement most approved in progressive Eastern {
cities, .Mr. King points out that one obstacle in the I
way of good street paving in San Francisco has been;
that cheapness is too often the main requisite when I
such work has been undertaken. The result is that!
our pavements in many cases have not been properly I
laid at the start, and, therefore, soon prove unsatis- j
factory to the public.
In illustration of the difference between the re- ,
suits obtained by cheap work as compared with good :
work, it is stated that the depressions and irregulari- I
ties in our bituminous pavements, accepted here as
unavoidable evils, would not be tolerated in the East
at all. The report says: "In New York and several
other cities the street-cleaners use wide steel scrapers I
instead of brooms and thereby keep clean twice as I
much pavement per man as our men can keep clean.
Samples of these scrapers were brought here some
time ago by this association and tried, and it was
found impracticable to use them because the pave
ment was not smooth enough. The two principal
causes for the waves and uneven surface of our bi
tuminous rock pavements are undoubtedly the lack of
a binder and on account of not being rolled properly."
It i- further argued that paving materials other
than those now in use might be resorted to by San
Francisco with good results, and it is said: "The
time lias come when the bituminous rock interests
should no longer prevent the use in San Francisco
of â¢â haltâ a material used in all the principal cities
of the world, and which is also a California produc
tion." A plea is made also for the vs C in certain lo
calities and under certain conditions of vitrified brick
and of asphalted wood block pavements.
_ _ *
The general conclusions are: Admit asphalt, vit
rified brick .-.nd asphalted wood block pavement in
competition with other pavements. Change the speci- j
fications for bituminous rock pavfng so as to require
.the use of a binder and also that the pavement shall
be rolled while hot with steam rollers. Require that
all business streets when repaved with basalt blocks
shall have the blocks laid on a concrete foundation
and shall be grouted with gravel and asphaltic cement.
Arrange if possible so that all pavements shall be
guaranteed for ten years with good surety bonds.
That the work of repairing the basalt block and cob
ble streets shall be done systematically, by dividing
the city into districts and keeping men continually at
work in each district and holding them responsible
for the condition of their districts. That, as is pro
vided in the new charter, the city itself undertake the 1
work of making repairs over trenches in the pavement
made by corporations and plumbers. Finally, do ;
away with the prevailing idea that cheapness is the !
main consideration. Good work costs money, but, if
properly performed, is always worth the cost.

ments now so extensively used in criminal and mili
tary descriptive lists, has just lost his position as head
of the French anthropometrical department. He

his superiors. He'll probably learn after awhile that
it is not always policy to give correct measurements

awarded to the Bentley Construction
Company of Milwaukee for $802,500 put? an
! end to speculation as to who the success
; ful bidder might be. It is generally re
i gretted in local building circles, as is but
natural, that the contract was not award
ed, to a California firm, but the stipula
tion that the material used shall be Ray
! mond granite furnishes food for congrat-
I ulation, as that brand of granite is a Cal
! ifornia product, quarried in Madera Coun
ty. Superintendent Roberts, who has
charge of the construction of the Post
office building, says there has been no
Intention at any time to use any stone not
produced in this State, and that all the
talk about such a possibility was based
upon a false understanding of the facts In
j the case.
The action of the Treasury Department
officials in making the award was un
doubtedly largely Influenced by the re
port telegraphed to Washington a few
days ago by the commission, consisting of
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Van
derlip, Dr. Whitehead, chemist of the de
partment, and Superintendent Roberts,
which was appointed to visit the Califor
nia quarries ami port on the quality of
the granite. The commission visited the
quarries at Rocklin and those at Ray
mond, and its report was to the effect that
California produces as fine a quality of
stone as any State in the Union.
F. E. Knowles, who is mentioned in the
Washington dispatches as having mad.'
the second most favorable bid, is the
president of the Raymond Granite Com
pany and the owner of the Raymond
granite quarries. Right here is one point
in connection with the letting of the con
tract on which information is lacking.
The successful bidders agree to furnish
Raymond granite, but that does not nec
essarily mean thai they are to get their
product from the Knowles quarries, al-
ugh the latter are generally known as
tlie "Raymond" quarries. It is the gen
eral opinion among local builders that the
Bentley Company will secure Its stone
from the MacLennan quarries, which are
also located at Raymond. The MacLennan
granite is of fine quality but somewhat
coarse-grained and of a darker hue than
the Kilo-., li - granite.
Among the other bidders from this State
were the California Construction Com
pany and Thomas C Butler. W. H. Ellis
of Cincinnati was one of the most aggres
sive seekers after the contract, and tie
proposed to get his material from the
quarries at Rocklin. Mr. Ellis' bid is said
to have been the lowest, but it was de
cided thai the Raymond granite was bet
ter adapted for the purposes of the Gov
ernment.
The contract for the stonework on the
Postoffice building will take twenty-four
months to complete. The Bentley Construc
tion Company also has the contract for
tin stonework, etc., on the Federal build
ing at Portland, Or., and is now engaged
on that work.

ANXIOUS LOVERS
SEPARATED BY
QUARANTINE
J. Strauss Longs to
Claim His Bride.
Julius Strauss, a wealthy merchant of
Yokohama, one of the detained quaran
tined passengers of the Nippon Maru,
.-Is that fate has dealt more harshly with
him than with his fellow-travelers. Mr.
Strauss came here to claim his bride,
and Instead of basking in the charming
lady's smiles and receiving congratula
tions from friends, he spends his days in
pacing the shores of Angel Island watch
ing for the tug Caroline. The young lady
who is to make Julius Strauss the hap
piest of men is Miss Nellie Meyer, daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Morltz Meyer of 2714
Pacific avenue. Miss Meyer has done
what she could to lessen the awfulness of
her lover's captivity, and each day, prop
erly chaperoned, sails by on the tug Caro
line and shakes "a. day-day" to the man
who spends the better part of the after
noon waiting for that bright vision and
tender greeting.
If Mr. Strauss had not been so anxious
to reach the home and presence of his
sweetheart the engagement reception
which was to have occurred last Sunday
would not of necessity have been post
poned. The original intention of th.
Yokohama groom was to come up on the
Rio Janeiro, but when he discovered that
by sailing on the Nippon Maru he gained
two days ho altered his p1.t.:.-. The Rio
Janeiro cam.- through all right and her
passengers have gone their several ways.
Alack and alas, haste mad. waste and
seeking to gain two days the impatient
lover has lost wo weeks!
Although Mr. Strauss has told his fel
low-passengers that th.- sole and only pur
pose of his visit to this city was to claim
a bride, the fiancee has as yet made no
announcement of their engagement. Her
friends know that she has given her
heart and her promise to. the Yokohama
merchant, but a.- no engagement has been
formally announced the good wishes they
are so anxious to shower upon her have
of necessity been held in abeyance. As
soon, though, as. the Nippon Maru pas
sengers are allowed to land the betrothal
will at once 1..- announced and the wed
ding day, which will shortly follow, be
set. Miss Meyer is a very beautiful girl,
charming and accomplished and a great
favorite In her select circle. She is a
native of New York and has been edu
cated in the Empire City, though for the
past twelve years her family have made
their home in this city.
Mr. Strauss is an Englishman, who has
settled in the land of the Mikado, and met
Miss Meyer last year when he passed
through this city on his wav to his Ori
ental home. It was a case of love at first
sight. Mr. Strauss remained in this city
but four days. When he sailed Misa
Meyer had promised to be his wife.

his party started to make calls on a few
friends. As the champion walked down
the corridors more than one fair neck
f-ho*cved its elasticity in an endeavor to
get a glimpse of the latest celebrity.
Jeff and his traveling companions made
a call at the County Jail to see "Patsy"'
Hogan, who sparred with the champion
in the early days. Mandate of the Board
of Health on the iron doors warned them
away. On his return to the ho;el Jeffries
received a visit f. did four members of the
local Boilermakers' Union; Charles Gal

John Simmons.
After dinner Jeffries' rooms i . . the hotel
began to fill with callers. He was joined
by his brother Jack. Billy Delaney and a
delegation from the Reliance Club. All |
sorts and conditions of sports thronged j
the place, and a squad of policemen in the
hotel court and on the Market street side
walk had all It could do to keep in line

There ere cheers as he entered the
hack ar.d more cheers as he raised his hat t
in acknowledgment. There were still
more as the band struck up "The Star- '
Spangled Banner," as a reminder that the I
championship was American again. Then
the band turned up Market. Jeffries and
his party followed in one hack, a dozen
others coming after filled with Reliance

Jeffries.
All the way out Market street crowds
followed as they have never followed any
thing in San Francisco, the street triumph
of the new fistic hero being ended only
when tho doors of Woodward's Pavilion
had closed hind him.
The party which accompanied Jeffries

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1599.
for the construction of an electric light
and water plant were sold In Santa Rosa
yesterday to the First National Bank of
that city at a premium of $250, and the
money was to-day paid into the city
treasury. The bonds had been .condition
ally purchased twice fore by a New
York bank and the Oakland Bank of Sav

the two systems will be at once com

SAGE SAYS IT. iS
A BLACKMAILING SCHEMI
So He Will Not Put Up Any Money 'â 
for Being Saved a Second Time
From Dynamite.
NEW YORK, July 6.â Russell Sage has
not been dynamited a second time, nor
has he paid $100 for immunity from as
sassination. Artemus J. Smith claims to
have saved Sage's life, though not exact
ly in the way he had intended. The whole !
situation is serio-comic, chiefly comic. It]
is somewhat obscured in Smith's desire
not only to shield his friend, but also to
find a hole to crawl Into, and it is robbed
of its soul-stirring features by the declara
tions of Sage and Mrs. Sage that it Is just
a simple attempt at blackmail on the part i
of somebody unknown. Smith wanted to
i save Sage's life, but he wanted it done
without publicity. Sage wants his life
! saved publicly, and that is why he had a
i letter published and sought the assistance
! of his two friends and protectors on the;
! police force, Mr. McCauley and James
i Roach, of the East Fifty-first Street Sta
tion. Smith said his friend had made no
specific threats against Sage, but had â 
merely talked about killing wealthy men
and had mentioned Sage's name. Smith
appears to be about 35 years old. His
company Is in the business of colonizing
reclaimed Western lands. No arrests will
be made.

A POSSIBLE RAILROAD DEAL.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The reported deal between the New York
Central people and thÂ» managers of the Bos
ton and Albany was in the main a surprise to
the mark t, but produced only a temporary
effect en prices. The significance of the trans
action Is somewhat of c. mystery, and the
fact that Its meaning Is oniy guessed at neu
tralizes its efTeet on values. Th? unprecedent
ed lenFth of the lease. 999 years, and the
guaranteeing of 8 per cent dividends on the
stock for that period cxc.it. considerable com
ment, and it is not easy to conceive what rea
sens may have led to these extraordinary con
dition.. Among railroad capitalists the deal
excites the less surprise, because the opin
ion has beer, gaining ground that there i 6 no
resi remedy 'or destructive competition
among the roads except through a series of
consolidations that will create Â» scries of am
algamated group* out of the several lines con
nee ting the Atlantic seaboard with the West.
Discussion of this question has developed int..
a general plan of provincial federation of (
roads, embracing on the one hand the Erie, ,
Delaware end Lackawanna and the Delaware
and Hudson in alliance with the New York
Central, and, on the other hand. at. alliance
of the Lehigh Valley and Reading companies
in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Com
pany; while the Baltimore and Ohio might
unite its interests won the Southern combina
tion of roads. These consolidations are not
expected to be early achievements, nor to he
prematurely forced, but to wait for convenient
conditions for their consummation. But the j
eeheme has gained such a firm position in the ,
convictions of railroad men that it is very
naturally reasoned that W. K. Vanderbilt'.
reported Requisition is a first step in this di- '
rection, '.-.- object being to bring one of the :
principal New England lines into harmonious I
co-operation with 'he N. v. York Central.
There appears to be some reason to suppose |
that a similar arrangement is under contem- â¢
plation as between the Vanderbilt roads and I
New York, New Haven and Hartford, which I
receives some plausibility from the supposed |
achievement effected In connection with the !
Boston and Albany.
"These are symptoms of a new drift in the [
railroad interest which cannot but attract at
tention. They are streaks of light upon the j
horizon of a vast investment interest which
has been long I louded by adverse conditions
that have stubbornly defied remedy. The facts
may not have any immediate conspicuous ef- I
feet upon the stock market at large, but they ;
Introduce a nev.- and very important funda
mental factor among the influences giving sta- 1
bility to the trunk line securities and helping
their advance to a foremost position among our !
yermanent interests."

THE STOCK MARKET.
There was quite a decline in mining stocks
on the early sessions, owing presumably to the
delay in exploring the 1800-foot level and the
assessment on Ophlr. The telegram from the
pump said: "No. 1 elevator is working con
tinuously. The water is down 191 feet 1 Inch
below the 1750-level and stands 3 feet 11 inches
on the 1950-foot level station."
The feeling was firmer In the afternoon.
Sales of stocks and bonds on the Bond Ex
change during the first six months of the year
were as follows, compared with the same time
In 1898: Of stocks. 405,760 shares, against 269,
--.'.,".4: of bonds. $3,573,700. against $1,796,500.
Ophir is assessed 13Â«\ delinquent August 8.

Mr. Schaffer.
DENiES BEING EXPENSIVE
_ â^ â
ADMITS BEING ANGRY AT THE
COUNCILMAN.
The Member From the Sixth Ward
Must Depend on the Mayor to
Carry Out His Plan of
Revenge.
Oakland (Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. July 6.
The Schaffer-Mille'r feud increases in
interest. Schaffer's broadside has brought j
forth a lively reply from Miller, who does
not deny that the trouble is all over
patronage.
The Councilman from the Sixth is or
ganizing his campaign and declares that
nothing will satisfy him but to see Miller :
ousted from his position >- Superintend
ent of Streets. In order to do this Bchar
fer must obtain two votes on the Board j
of Public Works. City Engineer Clement â 
is ready at ant time to vote for anybody
to succeed Miller, but it is hardly likely
that the Councilmen can corral the ovote0 vote
of the Mayor, even although Mr. Snow I
is in no hurry to state Miller. .
Miller talked frtsely of the trouble be- j
tween him ar.d Schaffer to-day. ''Mr.
Schaffer called to see me. raid he. ' and
asked why 1 had not given employment
to some men whom he had recommended.
I refused to put the men on after I bad
seen a published interview with Mr.
Schaffer criticizing my management of
the street department. I told him that
under the circumstances I did not feel
disposed to offer him any ..... ,_.. He
stated openly that he was opposed to me
and that he wouid always be, opposed to |
me. He has therefore no right to
expect anything from tne. I did j
promise to put some of his men at,
work, but that was before he denounced ]
me In print. Mr. Schaffer says that my
conduct of the office is too [.pensive. I
think If he will investigate the matter he
will find that he is entirely wrong So
far as I know he has not studied up the
work dene, l.'hope he will look into it.
and I am satisfied he will change his
mind. . ,"â¢_,',â 
'"Politics may appear to be. involved in I
this matter. We were on opposite tic.-
ets. He did all he could against my elec- ;
tion, when he was on. another ticket. He
cannot; as a consequence, expect a part
of 'he patronage of the Republican party.
He -Kid told me that there were several
perso is who had applied to him to -â¢â¢â cure
work for them. I told him to send them
around: But that conversation took plat
before 1 learned that he was righting
against me. l knew that he had been op
posed to the Municipal ague ticket.
During the past three months, however,
nothing has come up to ad me to sup
pose that he was still opposed to me until
his interview. It would be ridiculous and
inconsistent to apportion the patronage
of the party among those who openly ;
fought me. When I give employment to
men I do not make inquiry a_ to their ;>â¢>'- j
tics as a general rule. The street depart
ment is not doing politics. It is doing tiie
work ordered to be <ion_ by the. Board of i
Public Works and it is doing the work .'i
a business waj* and at the least possible j
expense." _________________
GILLIGAN WILL AGAIN
BE TRIED FOR MURDER |
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July ..
James Gilligan, 'charged with the mur
der of Jockey Epperson at the Emeryville
racetrack last .March, will have to be
tried once more.
The jury, after remaining out all last
night, railing to agree upon a verdict, waa
discharged by Judge Ogden at 10:30 thi._
morning. The jury stooo eight to four for
a verdict Of manslaughter from the time
the case was given them for deliberation
until they were discharged, and it is seat
ed that no argument or instruction could
have changed the attitude of ihe quartet
ot aeointters. By consent of the prosecu
tion and defense the case will on next
Monday be reset for trial.
At the trial that has just resulted in a
disagreement of the jury there was much
contradiction in the testimony. Gilligan
had stabbed Epperson in the neck, sever
ing the jugular vein, but the jury had to
decide between two stories as presented
in evidence. One was that the stabbing
was done while Gilligan was on the floor
being beaten by Epperson; ihe other that
the light was over when Gilligan ap
proached Epperson from behind and
buried a knife blade in his neck. Gilligan,
when on the witness stand, claimed he
stabbed tlie jockey In self-defense; that
he had been beaten by Epperson and was
nt>out to wash the blood off his face
when Epperson again attacked him. and
ln the scuffle that ensued the jockey was
stabbed in the neck.

WELLS COULD
NOT GET HIS
SON A PLACE
Slated to Succeed j
Keating.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jul. 6.
Supervisor Wells has been turned down
and there is a new deal contemplated in
the county building- During the trial of
William Keating, warden of the Insane,
it was frequently stated that he would
be removed and that young Wells, the son
of Supervisor Wells, would be given the j
vacant position. Wells had one soft snap
a few months ago as special watchman]
for the county treasury' and his Demo
.ratio papa would like to see the son got
a good grip on line or another of the J
county Jobs that seem to be hereditary.
Just what deal was made by which young
Wells was to be insane warden is '"'*
known, but ii was freely heralded that
he was to be placed.
Nov, comes the declaration from tne
majority of the Supervisors who have the
votes that ex-Constable Jim Page is to j
succeed Keating. This is given out as
authentic and Wells wonders why he has
been turned down. The secret is un
doubtedly to be found woven around some
other patronage deal within the, gift of
the board.
Ex-Coroner Baldwin Is desirous of be
ing physician to the County Jail, but can
not get there until Dr. Porter Is removed.
Porter of course, wants a better job at
the Receiving Hospital, but cannot get
there until Senator Stratum's brother Is
removed. Supervisors Church and 1 al
cott without Mitchell, are a minority,
and Mitchell is not free to vote against
any sires of Senator Stratton. ells
might- have been persuaded to md In
had a plum fallen on his son's plate but
as the fruit is going elsewhere all opals
are off. i * , . ."
A quiet little effort has been made to
make Mrs. Nickerson matron of the Be
ceiving Hospital. She can depend on the
vote of Mr. Roeth, but on account of the
able and faithful services rendered 'by
Miss McDonald, the incumbent, a Pig
protest has been made against removing
her. Some months ago an effort was
made to have the miserable pay of the
matron, 125 per month, increased to $40
but it was not brought before the board
although all are agreed thai the position
which is one. of hard work is very much
underpaid at present.
HONOR DUE DR. DUNN.
First Called Attention to the Foul
Germs in Telephones.
OAKLAND, - : '.'v '".-According to dis
patches published to-day a Chicago doc
tor takes great credit for discovering that
disease germs lurk in the mouthpieces of
telephones. He Is just two years late in
making the discovery for th. honor. If
any. belongs, to Dr. J. p. Dunn, ex-Health
Officer of Oakland.
Two years ago Dr. Dunn in his official
, apa , â¢ examined several mouthpieces
taken from telephones in ordinary use.
11,- discovered many kinds ol" microbes
and other foul matter, and recommended
that every telephone be supplied with a
little medicated towel, with which the
mouthpiece should be wiped before ing
used Dr. Dunn prepared an elaborate
report on tins subject, which was printed
and roused much interest throughout the
State \< a result of his advice many
telephones in Oakland have been supplied
with little towels.

rear of the J. A. Mam â¢ Furniture Com

cisco, the Judge of the Probate Court to
designate the asylums to be the benefi
ciaries. Many applications for a part of
the fund were received and the claims of
a number were rejected upon the ground
that they were not strictly orphan asy
lums within the meaning of the law or the
intent of Pearson. The claim of the San

the rejected and from the order and de
cree of the lower court an appeal was
taken. The Supreme Court affirmed the
position taken by the Probate Judge.
MORE PARK CARRIAGES.
Merchants and Commissioners Are
Pleased With the Cheap Con
veyances.
The member** of the Merchants' Asso
ciation . and Park Commissioners are
highly pleased with the success reported
for the cheap buses and carriages in
Golden Gate Park. "When Superintendent
KinK of the association was In the East
he found that such passenger convey
ances are In use in all of the. parks of ,he
larger cities and public grounds, and he
concluded that they would be as much
appreciated here as elsewhere. After fi
number of Interviews with the Park Com
missioners rr.e latter decided to give the
project a trial. A route about four miles
in length was laid out taking in the prin
cipal places of Interest and arrangements
were made for the issuing of stop-over
checks, so that the trip could be made by
the sight-seers by slow stages.
The carriages were started on the first
of the month, and those who have charge
of the vehicles report to the association
that the result of the experiment is more
than satisfactory. The rlrst carnages put
into service, have been running full ever
since the first day. Arrangements are
being made to increase the number as
fast is the management can learn what
to expect from the public in the way of
a steady patronage. This .will be learned
within a very* few days.
AN IRISH OPERA
WITH
CHARACTER IN IT.
Remarks \y_ Ashton Stevens
Concerning New and Old
Singers In the Tivoli's
"Shamus O'Brien," Together
With an Unblushing Appre
ciation of Denis O'Sulllvan,
ff== : 3 ORTUNATELY for the Irish
~_r_j ness of "Shamus O'Brien" Miss
Lichter has taken a vacation
_\ and the part of Nora is played
by a new Tivolite named Ada
Palmer Walker. The change is an im
provement. Miss Walker's voice will
md set the bay a-burning: it lacks in
iuseiousness and is inclined to be wiry,
but it certainly is an improvement on
the music-box mechanism of Miss Lich
ter, and backed up by a good amount
of dramatic force and sensativeness
finds happy vent in this part. Indeed,
Miss Walker's performance of last
night was notably good. She gave to
the part the intensity and sympathy"
that her predecessor had denied, and
invested it with no incongruous Ger
manisms. The only German feature
that is left is Mr. Pruette, although I
am reliably informed that he is an Eng
lishman. But his temperament is ex
clusively German, and never more so
than in this role of the good Irish priest.
Rhys Thomas is convincingly British
as the red-coated officer and sings his
part with even better effect than In the
first production; he now steers clear of
the modes! fubato and fondling of
the top notes and presents a really
striking character. Kitties music often
takes Miss Meyers beyond her depth,
but she acts the part vigorously; Phil
Branson (how often have I been tempt
ed to call him Pill Branson!) is some
thing less than his usual explosion as
Mike the informer; the chorus is gen
uinely animated, and the orchestra ex
. . [lent, although a few instruments shy
according to the score. In a word, the
production is a credit to the town and
deserves till the attention that it is re
ceiving.
As for Denis O'Sullivan, you simply
cannot overpraise him in the part of
Shamus, which belongs to him by all
rights of discovery and conquest. My
life at sent is bounded by Oakland
and the Golden Gate, but still I am
willing to risk the opinion that the fel
low doesn't live who can play and sing
Shamus as O'Sullivan does. It is large
ly due to him that the only big opera
which has come out of the mother
country In many years has been made
popular in America. You may say
that Mr. (('Sullivan's voice is not al
ways steady, that his acting sometimes
runs to excessive melodramaisms. but
you can't name the man who can give
to Shamus the Identity that O'Sullivan
gives. "Perfect" is a high word
and one that should be frugally em
ployed ny well-regulated critics, but it
is the word that fits O'Sullivan's pre
sentation of this character. Most of
the nights of my adult life have been
spent in a playhouse, and as a matter
of course I have acquired a gallery of
pet characterizations running from
Booth's Hamlet to Nat Goodwin's Jim
Radburn in "In Mizzoura." and as I
have now- witnessed about a dozen full
performances of "Shamus O'Brien" and
as there is small hope of seeing another
production of the work after the pres
ent run at the Tivoli is over, I may as
well take this opportunity to include
( ."Sullivan's Shamus in the stage por
traits that are for me indelible. To be
sure, 1 dote on the opera. I did at the
first and went on record to that effect
when many of my colleagues who now
praise it were giving it anything but a
sympathetic ear. But O'Sullivan's Sha
mus has been to me a matter of grad
ual appreciation; the better I know* the
piece and the part the better do I ap
preciate the brains, humanness and
virile singing that he has put Into it.
FLAGPOLE IS
NOW A BONE
OF CONTENTION

THE ENDEAVORERS INDIGNANT
COMMITTEE SAYS IT IS NOW
CITY PROPERTY.
, Â«.
Mayor and City Attorney Are in No
Hurry to Assume Jurisdiction
Over the Tall Mast
and Flag.
. â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, July 6.
Now it is a flagpole.
It has often been said that nothing can
j he done in Oakland, from feeding a pris
; oner to improving a street, but what is
; dominated by politics Now the lofty flag.
! pole which with its handsome flag forms
the only public ornament in Oakland Is a
, bone of contention. Nobody will own it.
I Some think it is dangerous, and the beau
tiful large flag, which can be seen all over
I the city, is the innocent cause of much
: contention.
The Mayor- wants to know who gave the
' Fourth of July committee permission to
erect a flagpole in the middle of a public
i street. City Attorney Dow and City En
gineer Clement gave permission for it to
;be erected in the City Hall Park, but
: without any further authority the 200 feet
, of timber was carried to Telegraph ave
i nue and New Broadway and there erect
ed.
t'raigie Sharp, who was one of the
prime movers in the flagpole incident, is
indignant that any one should criticize
the work of the committee.
"Oakland needed a flagpole." said Mr.
Sharp, "and now we have as- good a one
as there Is In the country. We are pay
ing no attention to growlers, of whom
there are bound to be some In Oakland. It
would have been folly to have placed the
pole in the City Hall Park, which might
be sold at any time. It will stay where
it is until the city wants it removed."
John A. Britton laughs at the fears of
those who think that the big pole may
topple over. He fays that it is just bare
ly possible that should a cyclone strike
Oakland the top of the pole might be
blown off. but that he is perfectly willing:
to sleep in the shadow of the pole all the
rest of his days.
Mayor Snow is not quite sure who the
paraphernalia belongs to, There has been
no dedication of the pole to the city, and
he is not in favor of accepting it. Not
that the Mayor is unpatriotic, but his
commercial mind has already given to him
the idea that if the city should own the
pole and it should topple over and kill
somebody or break a few roofs the city
would have to pay the damages. As mat
ters now stand a poor litigant would have
an endless job seeking to place the re
sponsibility for the accident.
The flagpole will probably be an "issue"
in the next city campaign.
The Christian Endeavorers, through
their county "president, are incensed that
the pole should have been raised and
painted on the Sabbath, and this leads C.
A. Blank of the committee to remark that
Sampson and Schley did something on the
Sabbath last July, and were not criticized
for their conduct.
JUMPED THE TRACK.
VENTURA. July 6.â Early this morning
a special fast freight train was wrecked
at Bespe, some thirty miles from this city.
This train was bound for Ellwood, Santa
Barbara County, with construction ma
terial for the Southern Pacific, According
to details received here, the accident was
caused by a car jumping the track with
six additional cars, all loaded with steel.
following as the train rounded a curve.
The train was hounding along at a rapid
rate at the time. The seven cars were
demolished.
The section hands, whose headquarters
are in this city, were taken to Sespe on
the regular passenger train to assist in
clearing the wreck. A wrecking train
and crew were also sent to the scene
from Los Angeles. It is expected that
the track will be cleared in a few hours.
The two regular freight trains are tied
up. The passengers on the morning east
and west bound trains were transferred.

THE CANNON BURST.
Joseph Skelton. a shoemaker, was ar
rested yesterday by Detective Ryan and
Policeman Heffernan and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of discharging
firearms within the city limits. It is a
wonder that he was not In the Morgue
instead of the prison.
Jam.es T. McManus got a permit from
the Mayor to lire off a cannon made of
cast-iron and weighing thirty-five pounds
on the Fourth at Tenth and Harrison !
streets. After firing off the cannon a j
number of times it was placed in the yard j
in the rear of "William Smith's saloon, on
the corner.
Wednesday afternnn Skelton took the
cannon out of the yard and he and Smith
and Peterson, the blacksmith, loaded it
in the blacksmith's shop. Skelton carried
it to the northeast corner, close to Mc-
Dermott's butcher shop, and fired It off.
It was reloaded and again fired off. but |
burst into pieces. One of the pieces,
weighing about five pounds, was hurled â 
through a third-story window of the I
house occupied by Mrs. 11. Getchen,
knocked down the cage containing a
canary and struck the wall In the room,
breaking the plastering. Another piece
went through the weather boards of the
butcher shop. Still another piece struck
Skelton on the leg, causing an abrasion.

Captain E. H. Howard, the oldest ship
' master on the Pacific Coast, was "on I
Change" yesterday for the first time in
many months. He received a warm re
ception and chatted for nearly an hour
with his friends and former shipmates.
Captain Howard is now 88 years of age
and only left the sea three years ago.
His first voyage was made in the ship
Barossa in 1823. She was a 1200-ton mer
chantman, armed with twenty guns and
carried 104 men before the mast. His last
command was the bark Richard 111, a
vessel of l."- tons, carrying a crew of
twenty all told.

castaways of St. Paul Island. There

days far out of sight of land. Some Lime
ago he was going to make a trip on the
Bristol, and some one told A. Uunsmuir
of the old shipmaster's expressed desire
to die at sea. Mr. Dunsmuir was afraid
that the very strength of the old man's
desire might bring aoout his death, so ne
had ins trunk removed from the steamer
and Captain Howard had to remain
ashore. ' , â  _ , Â
On August 1 next Captain Howard will
celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of his
arrival in San Francisco. He is as hale
and hearty now as a man of 60, but occa
sionally suffers from neuralgic pains.

AGRICULTURAL
PARK AT AUCTION
Sold for Judgment and
Costs of Court.
â â¢ â
BOUGHT BY W. C. ANDREWS
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 6.â Agricultural Park,
containing the race track, pavilion and
stables of the Santa Clara Valley Agri
cultural Society, was sold at Sheriff's
sale to-day to satisfy an execution for
37512 04 indebtedness against the associa
tion. It was bid in by W. C. Andrews, to
whom claims had been assigned, for
$9599 70, which just covers the judgment
with interest and costs of court. The In
debtedness on which suit was brought
was $7473 95 due the .Garden City Hank
on two promissory notes and one of
$338 69 held by lie* Farmers' Union.
Besides this indebtedness there are still
outstanding claims against the Agricul
tural Society gating $8000. These,
with the sum sued for, have been slowly
accumulating for the past ten years.
Most of the money involved is secured by
notes given by the directors Cif the so
ciety, but not by mortgage. For the past
few years the society has been financially
embarrassed and a Sheriff's sale has been
constantly staring it In the face. An at
tempt at reorganization with a view to
relieving the debt was made some time
ago but failed.
Agricultural Park consists of seventy
six acres, about a mile from the center
of the city. It Is easily worth $150,000.
There is a line mile track, plenty of stable
room, a pavilion and water works.* .:
The Agricultural Society will make a
further effort to save the property. An
drews will be allowed to acquire title to
the property and then will sill it back to
the society for the amount he bid it In
for. The $8000 remaining Indebtedness is
all for small sums, and these creditors
have been assured that their claims will
be paid. The new directors recently ap
pointed propose to reorganize the society
and mortgage the grounds or soil off some
of the land fronting on Race street or
Alameda for town lots and clear off every
cent of Indebtedness.
Fairs and races have always done well
in this city, and it is due to bad man
agement alone that this condition of the
society has been brought about.
CHEMICAL CONVENTION.
Interesting Reports Discussed
on Percentage of Phos
phoric Acid Solvents.
The chemical convention met at 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon in the Mills
building. The meeting opened with the
reading of a paper on phosphoric acid in
soils by Mr. "Williams of North Carolina.
This paper, while brief, was very Inter
esting and provoked a general discussion.
Hurt L. Hartwell of Kingston, R. 1., fol
lowed with his report as referee for the :
section. Mr. Hartwell said that he had
been considerably hampered in his work,
as the time allotted him was very brief,
owing tc the fact that he had been made
referee through the . reslgnatipn of his
predecessor and had accordingly less than
a year to do the work.
As it was a number of samples of soil
were obtained and shipped to various sta
tions throughout th** country. Thirteen
agricultural chemists agreed to analyze
the soil and report on solvents for phos
phoric acid. The time was so short, how
ever that but a limited number of re
ports bad been obtained and he did not
consider it advisable to embody these in
his report. lie made use of them by
comparing them with similar reports of
the past live years and obtaining a pen
oral percentage. Nothing definite was ar
rived at owing to the fact that different
solvents art differently according to the
Â«oil and the crops grown upon it. it
was found almost impossible to find any
soil wholly deficient in all the elements
of plant food. Pull reports from the sta
tions will be received later on and these
will be embodied in the annual bulletin.
The next meeting of the section was
programmed for 4 o'clock this afternoon,
but owing to other engagements it will
be held in the Mills building at 1. o'clock
this morning. 1

The second day of the convention of the
Association of American Agricultural
Colleges and Experiment Stations was
called to order at 9:30 o'clock yesterday
; morning in the Academy of Sciences Hall
jby President Henry P. Armsby. The first
business was a motion, offered by Pro
fessor A. A. Bingham of Rhode Island,
that the chair appoint a committee to
I make nominations for officers for the en
i suing year, which committee is to report
| back to the association to-day. President
; Armsby appointed the following members
of the association upon the committee:
j Director A. A. Bingham, Rhode Island;
President James K. Patterson, Kentucky;
j Professor 11. 11. Lough ridge, California;
: Professor R. C. Kedzie, Michigan; Direc
j tor R. J. Rodding, Georgia; Director
â  Charles D. Woods, Maine, and Professor
B. C. B.ffum, Wyoming.
Professor Louis H. Pammei, lowa,
j chairman of the section of botany and
â  horticulture, read a report upon the meth-
I ods in teaching agriculture. The report
! was of a statistical nature. lie said in
; part that in reply to circulars sent to
j the land grant colleges the information
received showed that in the line of botany
and biology there are engaged 61 pro
fessors and 19 assistants, in horticulture
,49 professors and 21 assistants. He said
1 that they were doing a great work for
higher education, having published valu
able, literature in the cause of pure
science. There are now __.''. students pur
-1 suing the study of botany in the land
grant colleges, and one-half of this num
ber intend to make practical use of it in
instruction or application to agriculture
; and horticulture, In the latter science
there are now engaged in Study 1006 stu
dents.
At this juncture President Armsby an
nounced that the time having arrived that
was set for the purpose of receiving the
resolutions upon the memory of Senator
Justin S. Morrill that the regular business
would be suspended. Professor Matthew
H. Buckham of Vermont was then intro
duced to the convention. In an address
of a half hour he extolled the many
virtues of Senator Morrill and showed
how he had given the first impetus to the
great science of agriculture.
11.- then offered resolutions acknowl
edging the great work done for science
by Senator Morrill under many obstacles,
and proposed that each State and Terri
tory show the respect due him by such
memorials as they may severally devise,
and more especially by such additional
grants and Indorsements as will still fur
ther extend the benefits of these institu
tions for the objects had in view by their
founder. The resolutions were seconded
by James K. Patterson of Kentucky Col
lege in a brief but eloquent speech, and
were unanimously adopted by a rising
vote. , , â 
Tin- regular business was continued by
the receiving of further reports .upon
methods of teaching agriculture. Dr. A.
C. True, director of the office of experi
ment stations at Washington. D. C, read
a syllabus of a course in zootechny. The
report was technical and statistical, but
it also advanced the idea that zootechny
should also Include the diseases of ani
mals as well as their production. The
paper evoked much discussion. The con
vention adjourned at noon and visited the
Mini In a body, where the members were
photographed upon the steps of the build
ing
The section of mechanic arts met In par
lor B Occidental Hotel, Charles S. Murk
land of New Hampshire in the chair, The
section decided to recommend to the as
sociation the election of the same officers
for the section for the ensuing year. The
following papers were read:
"The Teaching of Machine Design,
John T. Faig of Kentucky; "The Elec
trical Engineer-The Latest Developed
Specialist." W. T. Magruder of Ohio,
"Some Objections to Early Differentiation
of Engineering Courses." J. C. Nagle of
Texas and "Teaching Methods, G. '.win

recommend to the association that ab
stracts of all the papers read be published
' in the annual report Of the association.
The section of agriculture and chem
istry met in the Mills building and took

' The committee on nominations reported
the names of J. E. Stubbs for president
and Abram W. Harris for secretary. A
paper on "Agricultural Education Prac
tical and Scientific," was read by William
M ! Iggett Minnesota. It was generally
discussed and recommended to the asso
ciation for a reading at one of the general
sessions. , , ;, Â
The section on botany and horticulture
met in the Mills building. The .following
officers were elected for the ensuing year:
President S. A. Beach of New York, and
secretary P. H. Rolfs of Florida. Sec
retary Filcher of the State Board of Trade
was present and invited the section to |
visit the ferry building and inspect the
board's display in horticulture. The fol
lowing papers were read: "irrigation
Methods in Orchards," A. J. McClatehie
of Arizpna; "Climatology of Horticul
ture " E. J- Wickson of California; "The
Making of Garden Herbarium and Its!
1., g " A. D. Selby of Ohio and Burt Davy |
of California; "Horticultural Field Work
for Classes." A. B. McKay of Mississippi. i
Professor Wickson's paper will be read at
one of the general sessions as the report
of the section. - â¢ >;
The chief thing of importance in con
nection with the convention is the general
interest that has been aroused through
out the entire State by the announcement
of the fact that the association is to visit
a number of different places. Inquiries
are being received by M. E. Jaffa from
various localities asking that, if possible. '
the members of the association be brought j
to that particular section. Secretary Fil
ch, of the State Board of Trade thinks
that the Inspection of the State by the
association in its official capacity will !
be of incalculable benefit to California.
As soon as the evening session was '
called to order the report of the commit
tee on entomology was read by C. W.
Woodworth of the University of Califor
nia. He dwelt at some length on the San
Jose scale, which, he said, was of great
interest of California. Â

H. E. Stockhridge of Florida offered a
resolution affecting the long-mooted ques- i
tion of agriculture versus mechanic arts, i
in which he proposed the securing of such
legislation as will distinctly prescribe the
rights of the former science as regards
its place in all colleges coming under the
Morrill act. The resolution was referred
to the executive committee.
The report of the committee on horti
culture and botany was received In a
paper read by E. J. Wickson of Califor
nia, entitled. "Climatology of Horticul
ture." Much of the routine work of the
sections came before the convention in
the shape of discussion.
The matter of the publication of papers
read at section meetings, in the associa
tion's annual report, came up as a bono
of contention. The section on mechanic
arts hinted that it was not allowed the
space that the importance of its papers j
merited. Â.'--! '

WALLACE, Idaho, July 6.â To-day the
elisor appointed by the court to sum
mon forty jurors made his return, and
those served were all in court.
The attorneys for the defense objected
to proceeding oh the ground that they had
not had an opportunity of seeing a list
of the persons served. They claimed the
.prosecution had withheld this informa
tion from them, although it had been
i furnished to a newspaper reporter last
1 night. The court granted them until to
morrow at 10 o'clock to prepare, saying
I that no more continuances would be al
i lowed. Twenty-six of the jurors sum
moned are from the southern part of the
I count.-, which is remote from the scene
I of the riot, while the remaining sixteen
I are from the immediate vicinity of Ward
ner. "â â 
The decision in the cases Instituted for
' the removal of the Sheriff and County
Commissioners will not probably be ren-
I dered for several days, although the cases
I were submitted yesterday afternoon.
The miners were much encouragd to
i day to learn that the Supreme Court of
the United States had granted a writ of
error in the application of "William Boyle
for a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme
Court of Idaho refused to entertain the
j habeas corpus proceeding, and practically
1 held that the writ had been suspended
| by the Governor's prolamation.
The action of the Supreme Court of the
: United States -means that that tribunal
will review the decision of the Idaho
I court, and If the writ is allowed martial
I law will end to all intents and purposes.
i It might be continued, but arbitrary im
prisonment would have to cease.
Work on the new Bunker Hill mine has
i practically ceased. The company will
1 have to import a new lot of carpenters,
as all those belonging to unions stopped
work when they were ordered to make ap
plications for permits.
A number of arrests were made to-day
in the can yon. Davis Fader, the driver of
the stage between Wallace and Gem. be"-
Ing one of the victims. Fader's alleged
| offense was in draping a flag in mourning
on the Fourth of July.
A deputy marshal went to the Last
Chance mine last night and told Foreman ;
'< John Pressley to take all men without
permits, and "apply for them within five
minutes. Presslev walked out ot the mine.
, vowing he would never apply for permits,
and several miners followed his example.
, Late last night notices were posted that
I all men who had quit could return this
morning if they wanted work, but only a
part of them are working to-day.

men. The wages paid at Tesla are said
to be 10 per cent higher than in the Penn

THE ILLINOIS A GOLD MINE.
Over Three Thousand Men Eengaged
in the Fish Industry of That
Stream.
Over 3000 men are employed in the fish
industry of the Ilinois River. Each year
Industry of the Illinois River. Each year
is but. a question of time when that river
will be accepted by Illinois as one of the
principal sources of food supply in the
State. The big fishing points of the river,
where the business is handled in a whole
sale way. are Henry, Lacon, Chllllcothe,
Peoria, Pekin. Havana, Hath. Browning.
Beardstown, Meredosla. Kampsville and
Grafton. The fishing seasonâ that Is. the
commercial season, when the law permits
the use of seines in the river opens July
1 and closes April 15. During that time
the fishing companies with their tugboats
and smaller steam craft harvest the fish
ing crop, using seines which vary in
length from 500 to 1500 yards. In Lake
Peoria alone there are nine seines, each
1000 yards long, and last year In one haul
over* 65-0 pounds of German carp were
taken. As the fisherman received 3 cents
a pound for his fish "on the ground." that
' single haul was worth $1930. Near Beards
town a single haul of the seine brought
160,000 pounds of fish.
The fish are packed in boxes in 150
--pound lots, stowed away in refrigerator
cars and most of the carp and buffalo are
shipped to New York. Chicago takes
about 40,000 pounds of carp a week from
Peoria In the season. Then there is a
- system of live storage, by which the cap
! tured fish are kept alive until winter,
! when a better price can be obtained for
1 them. The first are loosed into pens.
â¢ which are made By driving stakes close
I together into the bottom of a bayou or
I shallow bay near the point of shipment.
! Here the captives thrive and fatten until
they are netted again and placed on ice
1 for shipment.â Salle (111.) Tribune. :,

EXTRA SESSION BOOM
IS IN GREAT DANGER
Rumor to the Effect That the
Governor Openly Sneers at
the Burns Programme.
Touts of the Mexican Alarmed to Think That Gage Has
Opened His Ears to the Siren Song of
Stephen M. White.
The touts of Mexican Dan re agitated.!
by reason of a rumor from the south that j
Governor Gage is weakening on the extra- |
session project, Since the Governor ieft j
San Francisco last Saturday he has been j
free from the immediate personal influ- |
ence of Herrin and Burns. On the way j
to Dos Angeles be listened to Stephen M.
White and other citizens.
The story comes from fhe south that â 
the Governor has even sneered at the sug- i
gestion of an extra session. The touts j
ho were, told yesterday of the weaken- j
Ing and the sneers evinced alarm. They
reflected that Burns was at Shasta
Springs and Herrin at some other resort,
while Gage was cavorting around Los
Angeles without a political guide or a j
railroad compass. Perceiving peril in the
situation they deemed it advisable to j
wire the Mexican of the Governor's j
threatened change of base. They are con- !
lident. however, that Gage will get Into
the traces again as soon as Burns and
Herrin get their eyes on him.
When the followers of the Mexican were
told that Steve White had counseled the
Governor against calling an extra session ;

Police Commissioners yesterday afternoon ;
charging Policeman Thomas Conway with
unofflcerllke conduct, and the matter will
be heard by the board at the next meet- ,
_ !
Magner lives at 1837 Hyde street and
Lynch at the Abbotsford Motel on Broad
way. They are In the habit of going horn.
together in the early hours of the morn- ,
Ing after finishing their work, and going;
to their work together.
On \\'edn< ' moon, while walking
along Taylor street on their way down
town they saw Policeman Conway talk
ing to some ladles who were sitting on a
doorstep. When they reached Conway he

A Successful Camp Meeting-.
The camp meeting which is being held
In Beulah Park. East Oakland, under the
auspices of the Pacific Coast Holiness As
sociation, will lie continued another week.
The meetings have been highly success
ful, a large attendance having been re
corded each day. The presence of a num
ber of well-known ministers has done a
great deal toward keeping up the Inter
est in the services. A feature of the
meetings is the eloquent preaching of
Herbert Buffum, the "boy preacher." The
memorial service in honor of Mrs. Anne
Spencer, who died last autumn at the age
of 91, will be held to-day. The deceased
was one of the veteran members of the

their indignation was unlimited. They
wanted to know by all that was lofty and
holy in practical politics if the Governor
intended to go to the Democratic party
for wisdom and counsel.
It *s known as a positive fact that
Burns less than a month ago assured one
of his supporters thai Gage had agreed
to call the extra session. The Mexican
remarked that he and Gage had resolved
that the newspapers should not run the
State. The touts were rejoicing at the
prospect of a carnival in Sacramento,
where all the members of the Legislature
and a great army of Mexican camp fol
lowers would be placed on the pay roll
of the State, when the disquieting news
came that Gage was turning up 'i' nose
at the programme. The touts are not in
a frame of mind to tolerate such exhibi
tions of independence on the part of the
Governor. They assert, therefore, that
it is high time that Burns and Herrin re
turn and administer to Gage another dose
of the magic influence. Dibble, who is
never disturbed by tlie idle gossip in the
Palace court, has not suspended work on
the proclamation for an extra session. He
does not apprehend disaster to the pro
gramme, hut would feel easier If Burns
and llerrin kept a closer watch on the
corral.
SLIPPER FROM
HIS CAPTORS
AT THE FERRY
Willard Baker Again |
a Fugitive.
â  aâ
"Willard E. Baker, who is wanted in Bos
ton for embezzlement, and who was ap- j
prehended in Seattle several days ago, j
escaped last night from his captors at
the ferry. Ip to a. late hour he had not j
been rearrested.
The crime for which Baker is wanted |
was committed about two years ago. He |
was a trusted employe of the Adams Ex
press Company, and encouraged by an- j
other man for whom the poll of Bos- i
ton are also searching he stole a package
containing $800. As soon as the theft was
discovered Baker disappeared. After con
siderable trouble he was traced to Seattle j
and arrested.
Raker resorted to every legal technical- j
ity to save himself from being sent back,
but after a stubborn fight he was finally
turned over to Captain Dugan and Detec
tive Morrisey of the Boston police.
Last Wednesday the prisoner, accom- |
panied by the. two officers, arrived ii this :
city. Baker was at once taken to the City
Prison and locked up preparatory to his !
return to the scene of his crime.
Shortly after 5 o'clock last evening the
officers took their prisoner and started
with him for the ferry, intending to catch
the Eastern overland. After reaching
the ferry Morrisey went to get a cigar,
leaving Baker, who was not manacled,
with Dugan. During his temporary ab
sence Baker slipped away from Dugan
and made good his escape. The harbor
police were at once notified, and the} in
stituted a search for him, but without
avail. Every outgoing steamer is being
watched, ns it is though! that the fugitive
will attempt to leave the city. He is de
scribed as being about 40 years of age, ."
feet 10 inches in height and weigh 160
pounds. He has a full heard, and was
dressed in a black cutaway coat, dark
vest and trousers.

The Richmond District Improvement
Club held a meeting yesterday to express
their sentiments upon the assessment roll
recently prepared by Assessor Dodge. A
preamble and resolution were adopted de
claring that the "roll is thÂ«Â» fairest and
most equitable" the city has had for many
years, and calling upon the Board of Su
pervisors to "stand firm against corporate
and personal influences that would re
duce the roll and thus rob the city"; that
as it now stands it protects the rich as
well as the poor, and that the board now
has the opportunity to regulate the tax
levy at a figure below the dollar limit.
The club further urges the Supervisors to
"stand firmly by their campaign pledges
and to protect the name, fame and wel
fare of our city." -. ;--

THE ALLEGED POISONER.
Prosecution Has Established Several
Damaging Facts Against Mrs.
Minnie Adams.
The prosecution in the Minnie Adams
poisoning case Is about ready to dose.
During the trial it. has been shown by
the State that the night before the
strange death of her Infant son, John
Richard Gray, the defendant purchased a
three-oui-ce phial of carbolic acid from
the store at Geary and Devlsadero streets;
that she told the father of the child that
she would let the baby drink the acid
if perchance he found it; that she had
a cape in her possession the night she
bought the poison, notwithstanding her
denial, and that she kept carbolic add
in her house at various times, a fad
which she denies. These facts seem to
constitute the case against the woman.
The most important witness on the
stand yesterday was Lena Kenny. Miss
Kenny" testified that she gave the cape,
said to have been worn by the accused
the night she purchased the poison, to a
daughter of Mrs. -Adams. Mrs. Adams
had requested her not to testify to the
I fact, for what reason she did not know.
This was all she could tell and she was
; excused.
Sergeant Duke, Oliver T. Cox and Dr.
I 11. A. Niemeyer were recalled for fur
ther examination on minor points, after
which the case went over until this morn
ing.

Auditor Wells Says the Dollar Limit
Must Be Observed.
Auditor Wells has sent out notices to
the heads of the various municipal de
partments, the chairmen of committees
of the Supervisors and those merchants
who have contracts for supplies with the
city calling their attention to the resolu
tion adopted by th.- board last Monday
limiting the expenditures for the next two
months to the basis of the Finance Com
mittee's estimate of the tax levy and noti
fying them that he will hold all hills down
to the limits prescribed. The Auditor Is
firmly convinced that the city government
will be seriously crippled, but he says he
has no alternative. He is most concerned
over the fire alarm and police telegraph,
and says that in his opinion if a big tire
should occur as a result of the Inefficiency
of the system the Insurance companies
would have good cause fori damage suits
against the city. He does not believe the
dollar limit is possible and thinks it poor
economy to reduce the forces of the vari
ous departments. : ;'-.-:. >Cv. ;

BAKERS' TOOLS
ARE EXEMPTED
FROM SEIZURE
The Point Decided by
Judge De Haven.
â â¢ â
JEWELERS' SAFES ARE SAFE
, a
MIXERS OF DOUGH NEED NOT
FEAR ATTACHMENT.
* 1
Even if They Employ Journeymen.
Their Rolling Pins and Other
Implements Are Immune
Against Creditors.
A,
Tn the matter of John Petersen, bank
rupt. United States District Judge de Ha
ven yesterday rendered an opinion that
will be of great interest to mechanics and
artisans, as well as to their creditors.
Petersen Is a baker, and under sections
6 and 47 of the bankruptcy act and sec
tion 690 of the Code of Civil Procedure
he claimed as exempt the molds, trian
gles, sieves, benches, rolling pins and
other portable utensils of his trade, val
ued at $100. The testimony showed that
Petersen employed journeymen bakers to
assist him and that they used these
] tools, and that journeymen bakers car
ried no tools or Implements with them,
nor were they expected to provide them
when employed.
Bankruptcy Referee Green found that
the articles mentioned were not the tools
or Implements of a mechanic or artisan,
and denied Peterson's claim to exemption.
Judge de Haven quoted an authority to
the effect that a jeweler's safe owned by
the debtor and used in his business as
! a jeweler and watch repairer was exempt
from execution as an implement of his
trade. The Judge said thai lie was of
the opinion that Petersen was entitled
to have the articles set aside as exempt
i The fad thai journeymen bakers carry
i no tools .or Implements with them, and
are not expected to provide such when
employed; does nut affect the question in
volved.
It Is apparent that the articles claimed
by Petersen are of small value, the Judge
'added, and it cannot be assumed that any
one of them is not necessary for the use
I of the bankrupt In following his occupa
tion as a baker, simply because he may
have employed others to assist him in the |
I use of such articles. Under the statute of
this State the tools and Implements that !
! may be properly claimed by an artisan
I as necessary in carrying on his trade are j
not In .ill cases limited to such only as
i he personally uses while so engaged, but
may Include tools and Implements used
by "others whom it is reasonably neces
[ sary for him to employ to asist In his
work, and in older that the same may be
prosecuted conveniently and In the usual;
; or ordinary way in which the business of
such trade is conducted. j
it must be understood, qualified the ;
Judge; that a baker would not be entitled i
to utensils and implements in number
j sufficient to carry on an extensive busi-
I ness. In the prosecution of which his own
i labor would be relatively a small factor,
' and of little value when compared with
j the capital Invested or the labor of oth
ers employed therein.
I Petersen was engaged In following the
! ordinary occupation of a baker on his
â¢ own account, and not as a journeyman.
Therefore the tools and implements nec-
I essary to enable him to carry on his trade
j are exempt, notwithstanding the fact thai
he may have employed others to assist
: him In doing the work incident to the
bakery conducted by him.
UNDERGROUND WIRES.
j Order Prepared by the Merchants'
Association Recommended.
The Street Committee of the Supervisors
yesterday reported favorably the order
prepared* by the Merchants' Association
and agreed to by the principal electrical
companies having wires In this city plac
ing all electric wires under ground. The
order divides the city into four districts,
practically covering the fire limits, and
provides that all telegraph, telephone,
electric light and district messenger wires
within the limits prescribed, which cm
i,,,;, the entire business section of the
city shall be placed in underground con
duit's and the poles removed from the
streets within a period of three years. The
four districts will be cleared of wires in
succession, so thai there will be no in
terruption to the service.
The committee also recommended sev
eral changes in the street-sweeping sched
ule, as follows: Placing Washington
street, from Battery to East; Sansome.
from Jackson to Pacific, and Battery,
Front and Drumm streets, from Jackson
to Broadway, In the second class, which
provides for sweeping one- each day, ex
cept Sundays. Streets in the third class
arc to be swept three times each week
instead of twelve times monthly : fourth
class streets twice each week instead of
eight times monthly; fifth class streets
once weekly instead of Of four times a
month, and sixth class streets once in two
weeks instead of twice each month.

ued for a week, and if at the end of that
time Richard is behaving himself It will
be dismissed.

CALIFORNIA'S SPACE
AT PARIS EXPOSITION
HARVEY W. WILEY.
HARVEY W. WILEY, expert in charge of beverages, candled fruits,
confectioneries, mineral waters an.! fertilizers at the Paris Exposition.
met the members of the California Commission yesterday afternoon
and announced to them that he would allot to this State^two-thirds
of all the space allowed for the wine exhibit of the I nited States
This will mean about 400 square feet of floor, and assures a splendid
display of the wine products of California. The commission expects to have
20,000 bottles of various vintages on exhibition.
In addition to this, California will have one or two show cases available
for the exhibit of candied or crystallized fruits.- Commissioners Foote and
Runvon and Secretary Gaskill, who were present when Mr. Wiley granted the
space expressed themselves as highly pleased, especially when he informed
them thai he would leave the matter of the exhibit entirely In their hands.
When Mr. Wiley was see , last night, he said that he had allotted the
generous space because California produces at least two-thirds of the wine in
this country and was entitled to it. _.__,_, _ _
"We desire to exhibit samples of ths typical wines of the leading vine
yards and also of the blended wines." said Mr. Wiley. "Besides these, we
will show brandies from all sources and a full line of candied fruit, repre
senting the best products of the State. Our object is to present literature
descriptive of the vineyards, climate, method of fermentation, storage and
ripening ami everything that will interest foreigners who intend to invest
in the lines or wines of California. For that purpose, one or two attendants
will be allowed the commission."
Mr. Wiley is at present chief chemist of tie Department of Agriculture,
and is "attending the Convention of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Sta
tions now in session in this city. He is also executive officer of the Asso
ciation of Chemists, which is holding its annual convention here. One of
