OFFICIAL REPORT ON
THE ALABAMA'S TRIAL
Commander W. H. Brownson Ex
presses Himself as Entirely Satis
fied With Results Attained.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Captain W. I
H. Brownson, who will command the
battleship Alabama when that vessel
is placed in commission, has submitted j
to Acting Secretary Allen this official
report of the builders' trial:
"I have to inform the department
that the Alabama left the yards of the
builders at a quarter to 3 p. m. on the j
2Sth inst. for an unofficial trial of the |
engines. The ship arrived in the lower i
bay at ten minutes to 10 p. m., and at 5 j
a. m. the foHowing morning-, after ad
justing the compass, ran outside and
made two speed runs up and down !
from the five-fathom bank lightship ]
to northeast end lightship."
Captain Brownson. then gives the j
time ietween The different, points in the '
first run, nhiÂ«_h was mpde at a speed]
of 15.45 knots perhour, and of the sec- 1
ond run . which was made with a
speed of 17.19 knots per hour, giving an
average for the two runs of 16.32 knots, j
"The speed was based." continued
Captain Brownson, "on the distance
between the two lightships. 11.25 knots, t
The weather was squally, with fresh
wind, and the sea from northward to
eastward, and doubtless interfered se
riously with the speed of the ship on
the runs. No defects of a serious na
ture developed, and, all things consid
ered, the trial may be considered as
highly satisfactory."
suzerainty question to drop.
Ttv dispatch of August 21 makes the
proposed concessions expressly condi
tional upon Great Britain undertaking
not to interfere in the future with the
Transvaal, not to insist upon a further
assertion "f existent f suzerainty and
; ., agree to arbitration.
ThÂ»' reply <>t the imperial Govern
ment, dated August 20. declares that
Great Britain considers that the pr>>;..>
sals put forward as alternative to those
of July 21 assume the adoption in prin
ciple of a franchise which will not be
hampered by r-onditions impairing its
usefulness and which will secure imme
diate representation.
With respect to intervention, the im
perial note says that the Government
cannot debar themselves from their
rights under the conventions, or divest
themselves of the obligations of a civil
ized power to protect its subjects
abroad from injustice.
The note concludes by reminding the
Transvaal that other matters exist
which the grant of a political franchise
will not settle and which are not the
proper subjects for arbitration. These,
the note declares, it will be necessary
to settle concurrently with the ques
tions already under discussion, and
they will form, with the questions of
arbitration, proper subjects for the
proposed Caps. Tqwi^conference.

AN AFTERNOON SCENE BEFCRE GUERIN'S HOME.
RENNES, Sept. I.â This was a
very satisfactory day for Drey
fus. The Beaurepalre witness,
Germain, who was to have
proved that Dreyfus attended
the Alsatian maneuvers, found his
statements denied by a reputable wit- i
ness, while Germain himself, it was J
proved, underwent two convict sen- j
tences for swindling.
This was the only testimony against !
Dreyfus, the rei^ain'ier of the deposi- j
tions being in his -favor, fever*) of
them being: very weighty, as in the
case of Captain Carvallgo, General Se
bert and Major Hartmann, their evi
dence going to show that particulars
| of the firing manual of the "120 gun"
and hydro-pneumatic brake were al- !
> most matters of common knowledge
among the officers and that the con
tention that Dreyfus from his special
position on the staff and peculiar.move
ments could be acquainted with them
had no solid basis. This was the sum
Tho Pretoria version of the imperial
reply was that Mr. Chamberlain was
unable to consider in-" 1 Transvaal's pro
posals as an alternative to a joint com
mission of inquiry.
PRETORIA, Sept. I.â The Volksraad
hap deferred the discussion of the cor
respondence exchanged between the
imperial and Transvaal Government
until Monday, when a motion regarding
the presence of British troops on the
Transvaal border will be debated se
cretly. Herr Fischer, the special envoy
of the Orange Free State, has arrived
here from Bloemfontein and is consult
ing with the Government on the situa
tion. Last night's session of the Volks
raad was short, as the reply to Great
Britain was not ready.
Herr Fischer was present at the se
i cret session of the Volksra.ad this even
. ing. a circumstance that caused a great
deal of curiosity. I^rge crowds gath
i ered around the building, anxious to
! learn the latest intelligence. President
, Kruger remained in the executive ses
| sion until a late hour discussing the sit
i uation. An influential section of the
I Afrikanders here wired to-day to Herr
Hoffmeyer, leader of the Afrikander
party in Cape Colony, to come to Preto
ria immediately.
CAPE TOWN, Sept. I.â Reports re
ceived here from various outlying dis
tricts of the Transvaal describe them
as being in a state of excitement. The
of to-day's proceedings, which were
not marked by any incident of unusual
importance, the Roget-Brugere episode,
in which General Roget clearly gave
himself away, being- the only matter
which attracted especial attention.
M. Bertlllon were severely snubbed
by the president of the court when he
wished to reply to General Sebert, who
had condemned his system as fanatical.

charged -with treason, the president of
the court. Colonel Jouaust, aroused the
Interest the audience by remarking :
"Maitre Labori the. other day asked that
information be obtained regarding the
character of a certain witness. I would
not have acceded if the witness had not
expressed a similar desire. Information
which has now reached me will be read."
The clerk of the court accordingly read
a report regarding M. Debruil, the Paris
lan friend of M, de Beaurepaire, who
testified on August 23 to the effect : that
Dreyfus met a German attache at the
house of a mutual friend named Bodson
the cross-examination reflecting severely
on his reputation. The report was to the
effect that M. Dubriel never was a horse
dealer, as claimed by M. Labori, and that
the character of the witness was most
respectable, he being held in general es
teem.
A groom named Germain then deposed
to having seen Dreyfus at the German
army maneuvers in Alsace. The general
effect of the testimony of the witness was
rather unfavorable to the prisoner. Ger
main declared he saddled a horse for
Dreyfus to follow the maneuvers and he
said that Major Infrevllle accompanied
Dreyfus, adding that the major told the
witness the name of his companion.
Colonel Jouaust questioned Dreyfus,
and although he did not confound the
prisoner in . any. way, Dreyfus made a
weak reply in declaring that he could not
remember whether he hired horses of
Germain's employer or not.
The next two witnesses, however, gave
strong testimony in favor of Dreyfus and
badly knocked Germain's testimony about.
His employer, a man named Kuhlman.
got up and declared that all Germain had
said was untrue, and Major Infreville
followed and declared he never knew
Dreyfus, so Germain's allusions to him
were baseless.
Captain Lemonnier, who was a proba
tioner on the headquarters staff at the
same time as Dreyfus, deposed that the
prisoner told him he was well acquainted
with a certain German position because
he had followed the Alsatian maneuvers.
Dreyfus replied that Captain Lemonnier
must have mixed up his remarks. The
prisoner added that he was acquainted
with thai part of Alsace because he had
spent his youth there, and not because
he was present at the maneuvers of the
German army ttiere.
A witness named Villon then told a tale
of how he overheard a conversation in a
Berlin cafe between two German officers,
ii! which a remark was made that mobili
lization plans were expected from Drey
fus. The cafe, however, has since dis
appeared and there are no means of veri
fying Villon's story.
Commissary Fischer testified that ho
was charged to investigate the leakage of
documents at the gunnery school at
Bourses and found nothing to incriminate
Dreyfus.
Lieutenant Bernheim testified that he.
lent Esterhazy documents dealing with
artillery and 'was unable' to get them
back. Artillery Lieutenant Bruges, who
attended a gunnery course at Chalons,
testified that it was easy for an outsider
to obtain particulars about the' guns. He
said that he himself had lent his firing
manual to an infantry officer. General
Hoget asked to be confronted with the
witness and said the latter wrote to M.
Cavaignac, then Minister of War, a vio
lent letter of resignation, in which he de
clared it was a dishonor to serve in the
French army.
This declaration caused a scene, for
Lieutenant Brugere, turning to General
Roget. cried:
"I protest against General Rogers
words. I affirm that I never said any
such thing."
General Hoget then backed down, say
ing:
"Well, that was the general sense of the
letter."
A roar of disgust came from the audi
ence at this apparent underhandedness
upon the part of the general, and LieuÂ«
tenant Brugere again emphatically de
clared General Ro^et was wrong.
M. Labori and Colonel Jouaust agreed
that the letter should be obtained from
the Ministry of War and read in court.
The Lieutenant expressed satisfaction at
this step. ;V :i ' ' , _ .
The next witness. Captain Carvalho, a
handsome young artillery officer, proved
an excellent reinforcement for Dreyfus.
He gave his evidence clearly and boldly.
He emphatically declared that there were
no special precautions to keep the mecn
anism of the "120 short gun" secret. More
over, he added, from April. 1804. the ar
tillery officers had a description of the
hydro-pneumatic brake given them. ; â 
"Here." said Captain Carvalho, "is an
actual copy of the manual, which I hand
over to the court-martial."
M. Labori then had an animated discus
sion with Colonel Jouaust. who at first
refused counsel's request to read a letter
which the latter had received yesterday
evening, signed "Corning," setting forth
that the firing manual had been ( copied by
men referred to as "A" and "B."
Colonel Picquart, in reply to M. I>abori,
confirmed the statement made in the let
ter, and said he thought Major Lauth
could say something on that point, where
upon the major, rose and declared he did
not know "Corning." M. Labori then
asked to be allowed to question Major
J-auth. but Colonel Jou&ust refused.

SAX DOMIXGO, Sept. I.â Members
of the retiring Cabinet of former
President Figuereo were detected
yesterday loading a lot of arms
and ammunition on board schoon
ers, which they Intended to send to ;
Azua, This discovery caused great ex- j
citement in the city and led to serious ;
j demonstrations. Large crowds quickly
formed in the streets, the majority be
! ing young hot-headed men, who
marched up and down the thorough- ,
fares in disorderly mobs shouting
"Viva Jimenes" and "Viva Revolucion"
at the top of their voices.
The great throng finally gathered
around the Governor's Palace last
I night, -angrily demanding that the Min
isters should at once relinquish all
their powers.
The mob then broke into the Palace
and destroyed a painting of the late
President Heureaux, hanging in one of
the rooms.
From the Palace the mob marched to
the residences of several members of
the Cabinet and begun hurling stones
through the windows, after smashing
the shutters. The Governor appeared
powerless and made no effort to curb
I the disorder.
These riotous demonstrations contin
ued until midnight, when the fright
ened and helpless Ministers announced
i that they would turn over their powers
! to men to be selected by the citizens.
; Four citizens were promptly chosen
S by the mob to act as a committee of
; safety, and it was agreed that this
, j committee should act in concert with
i t Governor Mejia until the members of
: j the provisional government arrive to
â  ' take control of affairs. The mob dis
â  | persed after firing many shots.
Foreigners here are safe as yet, but it
\ is impossible to tell what the next fort
, night may bring. Things look gloomy
: for the establishment of a stable Gov

i ganized a provisional Ministry in San

I 1 The revolutionists are undecided as to
' the man they want for President. It is
â  ! understood on excellent authority
I j however, that they are not in favor of
I 1 putting Jimenes at the head of the re
; i public. This attitude of the revolu
j tionists is likely to cause a clash, and
'> thus lead to fresh disturbances.
l Jimenes cabled to-day that his emis
' ! saries would soon arrive here and that
: he would follow them. Jimenes is pop

1 fickle and will desert him on the slight

testimony by saying .he did not think he

general then criticized the bordereau from
a professional standpoint, pointing out

' correspondent on whose doles he was de
j pendent. He said he was probably an of

cer adding that this was proved by the
' employment of expressions an artillery
< man could not have used.
The witness gave a number of instances
: showing the dense ignorance displayed in
i gunnery technicalities by the writer of the
I bordereau, and amid profound silence Gen
eral Sebert declared that his study of the
case had led him to the conviction that
the bordereau could not have been wm

belonging to a special arm of the service

Sebert referred to the satisfac
tion he felt at knowing that the experts

missed M. Bertillon's assertions, saying
I that on examination he, the witness, had

"It is painful for me," added General

CAPE HATTIEN, Sept. I.â There is

I made the most sensational revelation, ex-
I posing all the crookedness of which ha

RAILWAY BUILDERS
RACING TO COMPLETE
LINES IN MEXICO
Hnntington Trying to Beat a Rival Road Into
a Rich Mining District of the
Republic. -
Will Put a Contraction Force of Thousands of Men at
Work in an Attempt to Lay the First Rails
Into the Desired Territory.
Special PlÃpatrh to The r- a M.
AUSTIN, Tex., Sept. I.â An excit
ing contest in railroad building
is in progress in Mexico and the
result i? being watched with no
little interest by the business
men of that country. The rivalry is
between Collis P. Huntington and as
sociates and the Mexican Central Rail
way Company. Mr. Huntington and
the "th> r capitalists comprising the
Southern Pacific Company are owners
of the Mexican International Railroad,
which runs from Ciudad Porflrio Diaz,
on the Rio Grande border, t i Durango,
Mexico, with branch lines from Reata
to Monterey and from Mooclova to
Cuatro Cienegas. Tin- Mexican Central
runs from Juarez, on the Rio Grande
border, to the City of Mexico, with
branch lines to Guadalajara, Tampteo
and other places. Located to the west
of the Mexican Central and the Mexi
can International roads is a chain of
large and productive mining camps.
These rich mining districts were over
a hundred miles distant from railroad
communication and their development
has been greatly retarded on this ac
count.
Something over a year ago the M< xi
can Central quietly began a survey for
a branch line, which was to be built
from Jiminex, on the main line, in the
State of Chihuahua, to Parral. a hun
dred miles t" the west, and thence to
ward tho south to thp city of Dura
passing through Inde, Guanacevi and
all the other rich mining camps "t" that
pertion. Before the people of that lo
cality hardly knew what the survey
meant the work of construction was
begun. Several thousand men were
put to w.>rk and the road was com
pleted far toward Parral in an ln<
ibly short time.
Mr. Huntington was promptly ad
RESTRICTIONS ON

BY HORACE WRIGHT.

enable them to bring up tl.'-ir quota of
Japanese to the equivalent ol the n ..
of laborers of all other nationalities <m

HONOLn.r. Aug. 15.â Minister s. M.

abroad as far >i.Â« Italy. He mao >ail by
the steamer on September 2, and as the
situation now is will be jo ne for an in
definite time. In Italy he will have Im

out the complications which frustrated
the plans â ; some months ago to bring
Italians to Hawaii for lab,or purposes.
The original order to Italy was for ikÂ«'i

WASHINGTON. Sept. I.â Edward D.
Taussltr has been relieved of the command

Admiral Watson and ordered home .from
Manila. He Is said to have differed from
the admiral as to the management of the
Beet, and his criticisms led to the action
here noted. â¢...-"â¢ â¢ â¢ â  ;
vised by his representatives in Mexico
"f this move i>n the part of the Mexi
can Central Company. He acted on the
information promptly. He placed a
surveying party in the field to locate a
road from Durango to Farral, passing:
thmugh Inde, Guanaoevi and all the
other mining camps that the Mexican
Central's branch line is proposed tQ
tap. The route of this road has been
already located to a point beyond the
thriving town of Papasquiaro, in the
State of Durango, and it is authorita
tively announced that a force of over
three thousand men will be employed
in the construction of the road by the
lirst part of October. It is Mr. Hunt-
Ington's determination to beat the Mex
ican Central to Guanacevi and to force
the building of that branch road to
Mop at that place. It remains to be
seen whether the Mexican Central will
submit to this competition or continue
the road to Durango as was the origi
nal intention.
It is not probable that the road that
is being built by Mr. Huntington will
Btop at Parral. It is reported that it
is proposed to extend it to Gijaymas
on the Pacific Coast, where it will con
nect \Vith the Sonora branch of the
Southern Pacific, which is also a Hunt
ington property. Th<- route of the road
from Parral will be across the Sierra
Madres, passing through the rich
Batopilas mining district, where "Boss"
Shepherd's mines are located.
It is also confidently expected that
the Mexican International's extension
from Duranga to the port of Mazatlan
will be completed within the next two
years. The construction work on this
extension will be the heaviest and the
engineering problems encountered the
most difficult ever undertaken in Mex
ico, and the building of the line will
necessarily be very slow.

ficial was changed in position and the
place left vacant by his transfer filled
by a new man.
Charles A. Alden, superintendent of the
I jute mill, was the first to go. Alden was
J a favorite of ex-Warden Hale and in ad
: dition to having his salary twice raised
and being made a notary public was given
spacious quarter's for himself and fam
ily in the guards' building. Aguirre nar
-1 rowed these quarters a few days after ho
took charge of the prison and completed
his iconoclastic work to-day. Alden is

PITTSBT T RG, Pa.. Sept. I.â A holler ex
ploded at the Republic Iron Works on
South Twenty-fourth street shortly be-
I fore daylight to-day, killing five men and
seriously Injuring seven. The mill was
partly wrecked and the entire plant was
compelled to close down.
The killed:

son, 28 years old; will die. Frederick
Herb. 4S years, old; will die. Stephen Ma
laoaski, Henry Sanders. Peter Sohnitzer.
Unknown man, cut about head, left with
out giving his name.
The explosion occurred Just as the night
force was leaving; and the day force was
| coming on duty, so that there were only
I a few men in the mill at the time. If It
j had happened half an hour later the list
of dead and injured would have been
appalling. It occur r^d in the 14-inch de
partment and the concussion was terrific.
Buildings were shaken a mile away and
dust filled the air for two or three blocks.
It entered open windows and nearly stff
focated persons who were aroused by the
roar and the shocK.
Immediately following the explosion the
wreckage took fire Hfid this added to the
i difficulties encountered in rescuing liie
burned and mutilated victims.
A tire alarm was quickly Founded and
in a short time, the flames were under con
trol, after which the firemen were em
ployed in searching the ruins for the dead
and injured.
The first two bodies were identified as
those of Beavens and Matthews. The
men had been knocked down by the fly
ing bricks and were roasted to death by
the heat in their own furnaces.
When the boiler burst a section of it
weighing four tons was blown through
the roof and crashed Into the side of
the house of Gregory Sanders, about two
hundred yards distant. The building,
which was a frame, was wrecked, but the
occupants escaped with a bad fright. This
flying portion of the boiler tore down the
e-ntril supports of the roof, which fell
in and partially burned some of those in- I
Juror). The collapsed roof and the torn j
J and scattered pieces of machinery and
masonry formed a mass of wreckage in j
which the work of searching for the addi
tional bodies supposed to be hidden by it
was slow and tedious.
The bar mill, in which the accident nc
curred. Is a part of what is known as the
old Charter mill, and the present owner,!
tht- lifpublic Iron Works, is a department
of the National Tube Works, recently I
merK* 3 '! in the tube combine. The cause
of the explosion has not yet been deter
mined. The damage to the plant was
heavy, but the tirm could not estimate it
at this time.

UNDERGOING TRIAL
Sheriff Testifies That One Man De
tailed to Guard the Jail
Joined the Mob.
DARIEN, Ga.. Sept. l.^The trial of five
of the negro rioters began this morning.
Arming them are two women. Sheriff
Blount and his special deputy, T. A.
Bailey, who intituled to enrry Henry
Delagel to Savannah, but who were in*
tlmldated by the presence of the negroes
and the ringing of the church bells, were
called to the stand. Mr. Bailey swore
that he went to the jail with the inten
tion of assisting tho Sheriff In taking the
prisoner away when he heard the be..
ring and saw the rugroos gather, some
with guns and all txclted. One of the
tiK'ii now on trial, James Wylly, was
heard by Mr. Bailey to say that if Do.
lagel was taken from jail the streets of
Darien would run with blood.
The most interesting feature of Sheriff
Blount'a testimony was that he sum
moned a number of negroes to guard tho
jail after the demonstration and among
them was Bon Dunham, whom he had
Been in the crowd with a gun at the
height of the tumult. Mr. Blount ex-
that he hail placeri this guard at
i lie jail to ease the minds of the negro
population.

amination of witnesses for the prosecu
tion and Judge 11. I). D. Twi- for tne
defense. The indictments returned by tho
Grand Jury were all for rioting. Thirty-
Beven true bills were returned and in
twenty-two cases no bills wore found.
This action of the Grand Jury in turning
loose twenty-two men under arrest left
no excuse for a motion of a change of
venue and no motion of that kind was
made. The trial will continue several
days.

Discuss the Question of the Division
of Military Traffic.
OMAHA, Sept. I.â After a session last
ing for two days the trans-Missouri com
mittee of the Western Passenger Associa
tion concluded Its sessions to-day. The
principal matter under discussion was the
question of military rates. All present
agreed that the best plan that could be
adopted would be on the basis of an
equitable, distribution of the business at a
uniform rate. Such a proposition was
agreed upon, but before it can become op
erative It must receive the sanction of the
â  Missouri Pacific. Ttio Grande and West-
I crn, Colorado Midland and other roads
; which failed to have representatives pres
i ent at the meeting-.
Another matter which was taken up has
relation to the adoption of a clock ticket
on certain Montana points. It seems that
there h;is been an extraordinary amount
of scalping on Montana business, and the
committee belloved that the establishment
of the clock ticket would put a stop to
this.

whose body was found a mile south of
Howards yesterday by the crew of the
north bound train, was murdered. Positive
evidence to this effect was discovered this
evening by Coroner Edward Eden, who
has thereby furnished the authorities with
a clew that may lead to the arrest of the
assassin. Were it not that the remains
of Canaziani were shipped to this city for
interment ;t is entirely probable that none
but the murderer himself would ever have
known that a crime had been committed,
owing to the bungling work of a jury im
paneled to hold an inquest by Coroner
Pierce of Sonoma County.
When Canaziani's body was found it wag
hanging over a rail fence in plain sight
of a dwelling on the hill. It was first
taken to Howards, and afterward removed
to Occidental, where an inquest was held
to-day by a jury impaneled by Coroner
Pierce. The verdict was that deceased
came to his death from causes unknown.
The remains were then sent to Coroner
Eden for burial in Mount Olivet Ceme
tery on next Sunday. Coroner Eden made
an examination of the body, and was
amazed to discover that the neck had been
broken and the left shoulder dislocated.
Sheriff Taylor was notified of the dis
covery and telephoned a deputy at To
males to make an examination of the
scene of the crime. The deputy found evi
dences of a struggle and other clews. The
Sonoma authorities will be asked to co
operate, and a determined effort will be
made to apprehend the murderer.
F. Canaziani, a brother of the murdered
man. living in this city, will render finan
cial assistance in the detection of the as
sassin. ______________

KIDNAPER FREEMAN
IS TAKEN AND HIS
CAPTIVE RESCUED
Constable Blosser Captures the Fugitive
Criminal in the Mountains Near
Santa Maria.
Pretty Thirteen-Year-old Mexican Girl the Culprit Stole From
Her Home in Chino Is Found Doing the Chores
About the Camp.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. I.â ln a
desolate canyon near Santa Ma
ria, Constable Blosser found Free
man, the kidnaper, and his 13
--year-old Mexican girl captive. He
had succeeded in dodging the officers of
the law for some time, but was finally
run down by Blosser.
About three weeks ago Freeman ran
away with a 13-year-old Mexican girl
! from Chino. He drove a small bay
: mare in an open buggy and led a sorrel
racehorse, whose record in Southern
California astonished all turfmen. Hun
dreds of dollars were offered him for
his horse, but he never accepted an
offer. He Is a sport, gambler and race
horse man in disguise. He drove into
Chino with the sorrel horse attached
to an old buckboard. His horse was in
a pitiful condition, its tail and mane
were full of barley beards and the ani
! mal was apparently half-starved.
It was here that he made a captive of
the girl. She was infatuated by his
good looks, and his promise that she
i should become rich were she to run
away with him was immediately ac
cepted. He bought another horse at
Chino and, leading his sorrel horse, set
out. He started for the south, and
when the authorities were notified of
the disappearance of the girl they
thought his intentions were to fly to
Mexico, in which direction they gave
chase, but he outwitted them by going
in the opposite direction. He stopped
at all towns and succeeded in arranging
match races for different-sized purses,
for which his sorrel horse was to run.
At every race the purse was given to
the sorrel's owner. No matter how fast
the race, the horse would win easily.
This was repeated at Pomona. River
side and all the neighboring towns. A

CRAZED BY HIS LOSS.
James Gillick Fretted Over His Wife's
Misfortune Until He Became
Insane.
It is certain that JamPS Gilliok. who
killed himself last Wednesday night at I
his residence, 903 Twenty-second street, j
was Insane. The note which he left be- I
' hind him, and which was published in yes- j
1 terday's Call, was a crazy effusion. The ;
, evidence presented at the inquest yester
day showed that the old man had fretted
' himself' into insanity over the loss of his
; wife, who had been sent to the insane
asylum at Agnews.
Mrs. J. J. Flanagan, a daughter of the j
dead man, told the Coroner's jury yester
day that her father had acted very
strangely for the past few months, ever
Since his wife was taken away from him,
and was under the influence of liquor
all the time. She and her sister offered
him a home with them when he suffered |
his bereavement a few months ago, but
' their father preferred to remain in his
own home.
The jury returned a verdict to the effect
that Gillick committed suicide while ter- j
porarily insane.
A STRONGER OPINION.
Judge de Haven Speaks Unmistak
ably to the Point in the Ota
Deportation Case.
United States District -udge do Haven
handed down yesterday a second opinion,
stronger than the first, in the Ota case.
The Judge holds that the act of March 3,
1891 under which the order for the depor
tation of Ota is attempted to be justified,
does not apply to aliens domiciled in this
country and who are returning thereto
after a temporary absence. The court is,
however, powerless to review the action
of the Immigration Commissioner on
questions either of law or of fact.

a flight of stairs, or do any kind of work.
I could not get my breath and every now

my lungs were gone. My stomach was
also terribly affected and gave me a great
deal of trouble. My condition was such
that I had almost despaired of any relief.

seven doctors over eleven hundred dol-

the care of Dr. Aborn, and in three
days he gave me ' instant , and per-
manent relief. I now have a good ap-
petite, rest easy at night. My breathing

Q CAMP TAYLOR, Sept. I.â A large and ferocious cinnamon bear has Q

*^ and all attempts to trap or kill the animal have failed. Aside from the
X pecuniary loss suffered by dairymen from the depredations is the con- *;

2? human flesh. As a result doors and windows are tightly bolted at night. *Â£
cÂ» and women and children are chary about straying far from home by day. S?
V P. Bulotti, the dairyman, is the heaviest sufferer from the bear's â¦
S3 raids up to date, having lost three milch cows. Last Wednesday he saw 8S
â¦ the bear eating the carcass of a cow freshly slain and ran for his rifle. Â£
â¢* He had some distance to go. and when he returned the animal had fin- +

â¦ Bulotti says the bear is very large and of the cinnamon variety, X
â¢} He notified Sheriff Taylor of its presence, and asked that some action â¦ <
Â£â¢ be taken for relief of the dairymen. Next Sunday the Sheriff will gather SS !

THE BRAINS OF A CHICKEN.
Strong Language Used by F. S. Camp
Regarding His Enemy,
R. H. Hoag.
The bitter war between R. EL Hoag.
son of a New York millionaire living at
,ly street, and F. S. Camp, the N- W
York journalist known as "Hinkley P. 1
Swift." was intensified by the language
, with which they addressed each other In ;
i Judge Mogan's court yesterday.
Th- charge of threats against life pre-
I by cnmp against Hoag was en
tirely lost sight of in the raking up of
1 the past life of the two men. Hoag al
; that Camp w.is "a deadbeat of the
worst kind" and was owing peoj.lv every
where he had been. Camp retaliated by
charging Hoag with being a wife beater,
i which was promptly resented by II â -.
who shouted: "You are a liar!" The
.] idge threatened to order them both into
custody for contempt of court, and quiet
waa re-;.. red. but only for a moment,
when Camp. In. his anger at the questions ;
! asked him, said:
"That man is built like John L. Sulli- '
i van and has the brains of a chicken. He
is known In the Easl as 'Fighting Dick
Hoag.' His father is not a millionaire,
bui lives in a fiat in Harlem, and if he
i< worth JIOO.OW he is lucky."
Hong restrained himself by an effort
personal conflict was avoided, but
â  . brought on acain when Camp
( haracteriz^d a statement made by Hoag j
: as an unvarnished lie.
The Judge said he would render his
i decision Tuesday. As Camp left the, court
room he was arrested on a warrant from
San Jose charging him with defrauding
an innkeeper. The complaining witness
lls Mrs. L. A. Erkson. He was released
: on giving $2<K> bonds, accepted by Judge i
Mogan.

PARTY ORGANIZED TO
SEARCH FOR SKELETON
Sheriff Langford Has No Doubt
That the Bones Are Those
of Dunham.
RAN' JOSE, Sept. I.â Sheriff Langford
and Deputy Reives have reached here
from their unsuccessful hunt for the skel
eton seen in the mountains near Pacheco
Pass. The Sheriff says there is no earth
ly doubt that the skeleton is th<Te just
as Fred Keeler of Visalia says he saw it.
Keeler is a reliable young man. He was
lust .md badly frightened when he stum
bled across the remains and only sought
to get away from the place and into the
road once more.
The belief which the searching officers
have bad that the bones are those of
Dunham has become almost a profound
conviction. Sheriff Langford has deter
mined to find them and he is now prepar
ing to organize a big searching party
equipped t<> stay in that desolate country
for days. It la possible that the Sheriffs
hi Fresno, Merced and San Benito coun
tieswill in- asked to join with a similarly
equipped party. Langford would not have
given up the starch wnen he did but for
til.- fact that Keeler was forced to be in
Visalia to-day, lit: will arrange his af
fairs and join the Sheriffs in the next
hunt, which will probably be some time
next week. Langford says all of the facts.

of Dunhani.

CRASH OF
CARS NEAR
GUERNEVILLE
Lumber Train, Runnine at
Full Speed, Dashes Into
Six Flat Cars.
THREE MEN INJURED
No One Can Account for the Pres
ence of the Flat Cars on
the Track.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Sept. I.â Last night
shortly after 9 o'clock the Sonoma
Lumber Company's logging train
dashed into six flat cars standing on
the main track just outside the com
pany's yards at Guerneville. and as a
result three men were badly injured,
the engine demolished and three flat
cars knocked into kindling wood.
The train was in charge of Conductor
Tom Lane, and is used by the lumber
company to carry logs from the lum
ber camp In the woods near Bohemia
to the mills at Guerneville. The start
back from Mission Canyon had been
delayed and the train's crew was anxi
ous to reach home. When near the end
of the journey the crash came without
a moment's warning.
Conductor Lane and Engineer Mort
Dt-iil were hurled to one side of the
track and Fireman Ed Teadman to the
other. When picked up all three were
unconscious, and Lane and Deal have
been in that condition ever since.
How flat cars happened to be stand
ing on the track has not yet been sat
isfactorily explained. When the train
left the yard earlier in the afternoon
the track was clear. The only explana
tion possible seems to be that the cars
had been left standing on a siding un
secured and by their own weight start
ed down the grade and ran to the point
where the accident occurred. When
the crash came the engine was turned
completely around and fell with its
wheels in the air.
Conductor Tom Lane and Engineer
Mort Deal are very badly injured and
both may die. Teadman's Injuries were
less severe, but he will be laid ur> for
a long time. Deal is injured internally
and also about the head and back.
Lane has a cut three inches deep down
his hip, his back is hurt and Internal
complications have arisen. Teadman
sustained a broken shoulder and was
also badly bruised. Medical attendance
was at once secured and everything
possible done to relieve the sufferings
of the men.

iabber against a stocky and aggressive
mixer, Harris contenting himself with
meeting Barry's rushes with short jabs
and an occasional right-hand swing.
Barry had considerably the better of it
up to the third round, scoring some tell
ng rights. In the fourth Harris evened
up matters with a couple of hard upper
jilts and repeated jabs on Barry's mouth.
From that to the end of the fight both
men fought fast and furiously, but the
points were so evenly divided that in the
snd, without a moment's hesitation, the
referee declared the bout a draw.

MINERS BRING
FORTUNES FROM
YUKON DIGGINGS
Steamers Laurada and Hum=
boldt Reach Seattle With a
Half Million in Dust.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call
SEATTLE, Sept. I.â Two steamers ar- |
rived from Alaska to-day bringing about |
500 miners, fortunate and unfortunate.
The Laurada came from St. Michael and
the Humboldt from Skagway. The total
amount of gold dust they brought down j
is estimated at half a million. The re
ports from the Cape Nome district are
still conflicting, but the fact .remains that
considerable gold dust was brought from
there by passengers on the Laurada. The i
dust is very fine and has to be amalga- '
mated.
S. M. Warren and H. O. Roberts of
Denver brought out $50,000 from the Eagle
City district. J. Dickinson, who has been
In that district six years, had 525.0U0.
From the Klondike came J. H. Ladd
with $20,000, E. McGrath with $50,000 and
Charley Anderson with $40,000. One stal
wart miner struggled toward the assay
office this morning with a sack of dust
fifteen inches long and was asked where
he came from. "Eagle City, sir; and
that's on the American side and I'm an
American miner, and don't forget it." He
seemed to take as much pride in the
latter part of his statement as he did i
in his sack of dust.
Many hard luck stories are told. T. C.
Martin of Chicago lies in Providence Hos
pital and his old partner. Thomas Cragie,
of the same place, is dead on the barren
and inhospitable shore of Kotzebue Sound.
Martin went in two years ago and is a
physical wreck, glad to have escaped
with his life. He says the terrors they
experienced were awful and cannot be
described. He had to be helped off the
Laurada and into and out of the convey
.ance by a friend named Kyle, who took
him to the hospital.
P J. Peteison of Chicago, who came
back on the Laurada, said he has an iron
constitution and does not seem to be
worst- off for a long, hard winter spent
in the Kotzebue country. "I was the
only one, though, out of thirty-one who
pitched camp that was si bit- when the ice

Their bodies were found this spring.
Dr. Groves of Redding, Cal., died in the

The Btring Sea was swept by a terrific
wind storm on the 19th, 2inh and 21st of
August that made all shipping caught
out in it struggle hard to live. The Brit
ish gunboat Pheasant, the United States
cutters Rush and Corwin and the Laura-,
da were all caught and had a hard time
to live it out. All escaped, however, but
the Pheasant lost two of her lifeboats,
which were smashed by heavy seas wash
ing her decks. The huge waves that broke
over her piled down into the forecastle,
driving every Jack Tar to other parts of
the ship.
The Rush and the Phea*int after the ;
storm put into Dutch Harbor, where the
Laurada saw them. The latter vessel
was caught by the hurricane one day this
Bide "f Nome" at about 10 o'clock on the
night of the 19th. It came up from the
p.nithwest and blew with terrilic force
until the 22d. The Laurada was heading
into it and shipped but few seas. Sailors
of the cutters said it was the worst storm
they had ever encountered.
ST MICHAEL, Alaska. Aug. 14. via
le, Sept. I.â The investigation of the
reported murder <>i the members of the
Jessie expedition by Indians at the mouth
of the Kuskokwlm River last summer has
begun. The revenue cutter Corwin, Cap
tain Herring, left to-day ' for Nunivak
Island, where R. C. Marsten. a trader,
who says the members of the expedition
were massacred, will be taken aboard. |
The Corwin will then go to the mouth of ,
the Kuskokwim and land an investigating
party, which, besides members of the i
crew, will include United States Marshal
Shuup, who arrived here several days ago
in < ompany with United States District
Judge Johnson. It is expected the inves- |
tigation will last several days. If any
evidence of murder is found the suspected
natives will be arrested and taken to Sit
ka for trial on the revenue cutter McCul
loch.
An incident occurred several days ago j
that strengthens the murder theory. Tne 'â 
schooner Bowhead, Captain Cook, reports
that on July 15 she put into Kuskokwim
Bay with supplies for the Moravian mis- j
sion at Bethel. A small boat was launched !
and [>ut ashore in charge of the first mate j
and two men to secure help to lighter the I
supplies ashore. Captain Cook waited j
two days for the men to return. On the
third day a gale caused him to put to ;
sea. He returned to the boat two days i
afterward and waited for his men. with
out success. He then sailed for St. Mi
chael and laid the matter before the rev- j
enue officers.
The small military jail at this fort is al
most filled with prisoners. They have all
been remanded for trial at Sitka th\s fall.
Among the prisoners is Homer Bird of
New Orleans, who shot and killed two
companions at Anvik last winter, anJ an
Indian named Azzurak. who killed Clar
ence Boyd, a prospector, at a village on
the Diomede Island in lS'j", and an Indian
named Nubarloo, who killed a prospector \
named Jenkins on Kotzebue Sound lust ;
fall and Sablock. alias captain Jack, an
Indian of the Diomede Island, who at- j
tempted to kill W. F. Doty, a teacher m I
the Government school at Clarence. An- I
other prisoner is Harry Temple of Olym
pia, Wash., who attempted to kill a ship
mate on the whaler Mermaid at Port
Clarence last July. The Indian prisoners j
and Temple were gathered together by
Captain Jarvis of the Bear during a re- ;
cent trip to Port Clarence.
Another murder is reported to have ;
taken place early in July near Hamilton, |
on the Yukon River. Martin Engbrech- I
sten, a prospector, while sailing down the ;
river from Dawson in a small boat with a
companion named Tokelson, was shot and
killed by an Indian in a canoe. The In
dian has not been apprehended. The mur
der was probably to avenge some fancied
wrong imflicted In the past by a white
man. Engbrechsten was a sailor, 40 years
old. He was possessed of about $500,
which is In the custody of United States
Commissioner Shepard.
A veritable stampede has set In from
this place to Cape Nome, not less than
fifty employes of the Alaska Commercial
Company and Northern American Trans
portation and Trading Company leaving
within the past few days for the new
diggings. The men, many of whom have
been working for salaries ranging from
$50 to $75 a month, have been crazed by
the reports recently brought over from
Anvil City by returning miners, every
one of whom Is loaded down with beach
gold. Added to this Is the demand made
upon the trading companies for quick
silver, copper plate, cyanide and other
articles*' used in rockering. Money is no
object In the purchase of these articles,
and it is not an uncommon occurrence to
see men offer $3 a pound for quicksilver
and as much for copper plate.
A nugget weighing an ounce was found
last week on the beach, and when the
news was circulated there was a wilder
rush than ever to secure rockers. Miners
working on the creek claims threw down i
their shovels and asked for their time
that they might share in the good luck i
of the 500 or more men on the beach. The
result was a general advance in wages.
Noble Wallingford of Seattle and part
ner in twenty hours' work one day last
week rocked out $725. and in one pan last
Friday Mr. Wallingford took out $18. I
This piece of ground is about ten miles \
from Anvil City, showing that gold is
to be found along the entire beach as !
fur as Port Clarence.
Equally as exciting as the finding !
of the $16 nugget on the beach was the |
finding of a twenty-ounce nugget on I
Bryntesen's claim No. 1. below Discovery,
on Anvil, last week. This is the largest
nugget yet found in the district.

Leaving Than Entering the '
District.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Sept. I.â The
Dirigo arrived from Alaska toj-jiay. .with,
200 passengers and gold dust estimated at
a quarter of a million. The biggest win
ner is Barclay of North Dakota, with
JluO.Ouo. Among the passengers was C. S.
Coatsworth, who went in over the Ed
monton route. He reports that Dr. Ma
son of Chicago and others who were sick
with scurvy at Wind City got through
safely.
Since the opening of navigation, accord
ing to passenger lists, TÂ»447 people have left
Dawson and 2889 have arrived there. This
aggregate does not include 1000 or 1500
men who floated down the river to Cape
Nome. It is estimated that there are
3000 "broke" men In the Klondike who
must get out of the country or become
objects of charity next winter.
The telegraph line has reached a point
on the Yukon River l">0 miles south of
Dawson. The work is being pushed ahead
at the rate of five miles a day.
The Government is building a wagon
trail from Caribou crossing to a point De

This will lesser, the distance on the winter

SANTA CRUZ BUYS
HIHN WATER PLANT
Long-Standing Trouble Between the
Corporation and the Munici
pality at an End.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept.'l.-Through the ef
forts of citizens an agreement has been
reached with the Hihn Company for the
transfer of its water system to the city
of Santa Cruz, thus ending the water is
sue, which has been before the people of
Santa Cruz ever since the city constructed
its own system. At an informal meeting
held last evening by the City Council the
proposition of the Hihn Company was ac
cepted. The agreement carries with it an
additional agreement that the Hihn Com
pany will sHI to the city the Brancefort
system whenever East Santa Cruz shall
be come a part of the city, the value
thereof to be determined by arbitration.
All litigation between the city and com
pany is to be dropped, the latter paying
all taxes and costs.
Recently the city offered to purchase the
Hihn system for Jisn.ooo, at the rate of $500
per month for thirty years, at the end of
which time the city was to become the
absolute owner. The corporation was will
ing to sell its system within the limits of
the city, but declined to dispose of that
part of the system which supplied East
Santa Cruz. All negotiations were there
upon declared off. and the Council adopted
a resolution giving free water for do
mestic purposes on and after September 1.
This resulted in a reduction of the reve
nue derived by the Hihn Company, and
the latter then came to terms.
The addition of these systems to its own
will give the city an income which in time
will almost defray the running expenses
of the municipal government, and is ex
pected to make a material reduction in
the tax rate.

OLAA TRACT NOT

ation.
SQUATTERS HAVE NO RIGHTS
LAND IS IN THE CUSTODY Of ;
THE GOVERNMENT.
When the Proper Time Comes It Will
Be Sold to Settlers and Specu
lators Will Be Barred
Out,
Ey HORACE VVRIJHT.
HONOLULU, Aug. 26.â1 am in receipt
of a communication from an alleged I
squatter on the Olaa lands, on the island !
vi Hawaii, to the following purport, and
have investigated the matter at the
fountainhead:
For several months pan the Hawaiian Gov
ernment h;>H advertised in the United States i
l Ã¼bllc >>>â¢:- ami has stated thÂ« terms by
which the* con be sbtaitlsd, which are very I
tavorntile to the settler. On the strength 'if |
ttiese representations a lure* number have
>vme to the inlands to take lands and maka
fur themselves homes. Ther have waited all
the way from six months to a year and still
the lands are nut open. HrowlnK impatient,
thÂ» Intending settlers began investigating atxi
found out several things. First 'â¢' Â«11 they
learned thai sugar plantation promoters were
contracting with men to settle on the land and
agreeing to pa) them for their time and the
cost of all necessary improvements with the
understanding that they were to deed it to satfl
promoters as soon as th<Â» patent was obtained.
They also learned that by the terms of the an
nexation treaty the Hawaiian Government can
not dispose of it n^r can the United Slates Gov
ernment until Congress enacts special laws.
The intending settlers wish to obtain a perfect
title, and believing that that can only come
through Congress as things stand at present,
they settled on the land to prevent Its being
opened by the local authorities an I to initiate
tlidr own right to the land. The island author
ities! propose to open thl* land November 24. j
and there sr.' =pvÂ«ml hundred American clti- â 
fetis here who will tje barred out, and they ;
wish to know what Uncle Sum is doing to do
about it.
IVesident t>o!e ; being in theory and j
bractiee at the head of these lurid mat- j
ters and the active founder of the public i
lands and homestead laws. I applied to
blin among others for the necessary infor- i
inutioii; with the following result, which |
v.ill show that the "squatters, 1 ' of whom !
there are but very fewâ some thirty at the j
tnostâ have no rights at all.
The first tracts of land in the Olaa r>;r.- ;
tie; . a very fertile one and now becom
ing famous for the sugar and coffee -being
raised Within the belt, were not allotted
satisfactorily* owing to certain conditions â 
attaching to them which could not be con- |
Venlently remedied; and it i.- very prob
able that thÂ° intentions of the Govern
tiient to preserve them as homesteads for
bona lide settlers who would build up a
family home thereon were in Instances
frustrated.
With the present sections, however. it |
is differentâ the first place, as to whom
the title of the lands is vested. This
has been clearly defined by the State. De
partment in Washington in correspond- j
ence with the Hawaiian Government on j
categorical queries since annexation was j
aplished by the New-lands resolution. j
The United State* holds theÃe landn in i
trust for the Hawaiian people, and their
revenues are to be applied to specific pur
poses, and the Hawaiian Government acts
as the agent of the Federal Government |
In their administration, the mere use of j
the title* of "a republic" and "President"
being held not to grant independence or {
independent action. It is also explicitly i
decided that the land laws of the United |
States do not apply to Hawaii until Con - !
press has taken action. These lands do
not. in any practical sense of the word, i
correspond to the unsurveyed public lands
of the United States upon which "squat
ters" are presumed to have Inchoate j
lights of settlement. They are and have ;
!â â¢â !, for years surveyed lands, with the i
legal title vested in the Government of ]
Hawaii, and are not open to squatters, for |
there is no dispute of jurisdiction or title
between the Federal and the home Gov- !
ernments.
It should also be said that the corre- j
Bpondent is in error In stating that the i
opening up of these lands has been ad- !
vertised in the United States. There has j
been no authority for such action. They
have been advertised in certain " of ' the. l
Hawaiian newspapers and their sales I
open at Hilo Courthouse on November j
24, The desire has naturally been to ob- i
tain American or European farmers for I
sugar, coffee or fruit, as cereals are out !
of the question:
There are -500 lots averaging about fifty I
acres in each lot in this new district, and
the "upset price" ranges all the way from !
$1 to $20 an acre, principally from $10
to $20.
The conditions are such that every op
portunity is given to encourage bona fide |
settlement and to discourage land-grab
bing and speculative purchases, which,
however, under existing laws cannot be
absolutely prevented.
The principal conditions are: A pur
chaser of one lot may bid for a second lot
in actual contact with the first lot, hut
for no other, this rule applying to the lots
other than those on th. main road, but
a purchaser of a lot on the main road
cannot bid for a second lot on said road,
but may bid on a second lot elsewhere.
The agreement of sale contains also the
following conditions:
The purchase price of the land -to bÂ» paid
within ten years, either in full . at my time
within said period of ten years, .or In Install
ments of one or more tenths of the purchase
price on any interest date. Interest at rate of
6 per cent per annum from date of agreement
. n unpaid balance of purchase price, payable
annually. â¢ '
The purchaser shall begin substantial Im
provement of hi* holding within two years
(roni date of agreement, and shall from the
r-nd of second year have under cultivation at
all times not less than 10 per cent of the prem
ise? To entitle htm to patent grant *lying fee
simple title, he shall continuously maintain his
home upon the premises for a term of six
rears anil have at the end of such term 25 per
<-rnt of the premises under bona-flde cultiva
tion or shall have maintained his home con
tinouously upon the premises for four yearÂ«
and have under cultivation, it the end of such
period 50 per cent of the premises, such main
taining of a home to begin- at any time before
the end of the fourth year from date of agree-
He' shall plant. If not already growing, and
maintain In good growing condition from end
of second /ear until termination of. agreement^
' :.r. average of not lenÂ« than ten timber, shade
or fruit trees per acre.
He shall allow the agents of the Government
at all times to enter and examine the premises,
and shall pay any taxes that may become due
1 on the flume. At the end of th. tenth year,
er earlier If all conditions necessary thereto
i have been substantially complied with, the pur
| chaser shall lie entitled to a land patent, con
veying fee simple title to thÂ« land described
I in agreement or sale.
In case of default or failure to perform the
I required conditions the Commissioners may
; take possession of the premises and may Bell
j the same at auction, either as a whole or in
parcels, for cash or terms of time payments;
and If ouch i>Hle results in advance on the
original price, the original purchaser to re
ceive therefrom the amount of his payments
to the Government on account of purchase,
without interest, and a pro rata share In such
advance in proportion to the amounts of his
payments. If such sale shall result, however,
| In a less price than the original the amount
returned to him shall be charged with a pro
' rnta amount of such decrease portioned to
: the amounts of his payment.
An agreement of sale covering such con
ditions Of Mile shall be made with the Gov
ernment, and no assignment of Interest under
', such agreement shall he made without the
written consent of the Commissioners of' Public
Lands.
One would think that these conditions
are fair and reasonably protective ones
and In the interests of buna fide settlers
Rnd the Government alike.
The so-called squatters have merely
struck 11 Â»take in the ground and lawyers
are found willing enough to take their
fees and encourage them with a founda-
Uobless hope. Mr. Dole emphatically an
nounced that they had no rights what
ever and that bona fide purchasers would
be protected in their rights by the Gov
ernment, who feels no doubt of the cor
rectness of their position as defined by the
Federal Government".

BOTH SIDES ANXIOUS.
Indications That a Grand Coup Is
Coming in Dreyfus Case.
NEW YORK. Sept Lâ The World cable
from Rennes says: As the end of the
trial approaches both sides are plainly
anxious. Jules Lemaitre. a member of tho
Academy, one of the foremost journalists
now here, is very close to the generala
and one of my friends in Nationalist
camps. He admitted to-day that he came
to consult with other anti-Dreyfus
leaders about starting immediately a vig
orous press campaign to prepare the
people fur a. military coup in case of ac
quittal.
Another dramatic effect is undoubtedly
coming. Mme. Pays, who was Ester
hazy's associate, is secreted in these
suburbs. She has been here two weeks,
and Major Lauth is coaching her every
afternoon in the part she snail play. It is
surmised that she has been brought here
to testify, ii su<*h testimony Is needed,
that Esterbazy got a small fortune from
the Jewish syndicate to confess himself
the author of the bordereau. To-day on
the campus I heard an officer say to Col
â¢ â  mdler.
"But, colonel, if Dreyfus is innocent,
how do. you explain it that so many peo
ple i oine to testify against him?"
There lies the danger to Dreyfus, Sol
diers are not always subtle. The judges
of Dreyfus do not seem to be particularly
intellectual. If they reason like their
brother of the army 1 have just quoted,
the poor captain is doomed, for new wit
nesses are .springing up against him every

MOB ATTACKS
MORMON ELDERS
Miss Harden, a Peace
maker, Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHATTANOOGA,' Term., Sept. I.â
Wednesday night six Mormon elders
were conducting a meeting in a school
house at P.me Bluff, Stewart County,
Term., when the building was stormed
by a mob of over a hundred men. The
i building was almost demolished. Those
! inside fled In a panic to save their lives,
las bullets commenced to strike the
'' building thick and fast.
When Elders Hiram Olson and H. C.
Petty left the building Miss May Har
den, a popular young woman of the
place, walked between them with a
view of checking the work of the mob.
While the trio passed down the road
shots were Bred from ambush.
The woman was hit by a bullet and
almost instantly killed. Her brothers
vowed they would avenge the crime,
and after the first excitement died out
Becured bloodhounds and placed them
on the trail of the assassins.
Burton Vtnson, a prominent young
farmer and superintendent of a Sun
day-School, wrote a confession, stating
that he had killed the girl, but that it
â  was an accident, and that he wished to
i rid himself of remorse of conscience.
Shortly after the confession the
bloodhounds trailed him to his home.
Vinson turned, picked up a knife and
cut his throat, almost at the same in
stant sending a bullet through his
' brain. His family and the officers'
i posse witnessed the suicide.

FELL INTO A SEWER.
Unpleasant Experience of Emmet
Strong, a Six- Year-Old Boy.
Emmet Strong, a boy 6 years of age,
1 had the unpleasant experience yesterday
j afternoon 01 falling into a sewer at Kif t h
I and Shipley streets, ami if it had not been
for the presence of mind of Juck Ottosen,
| who lives at 2T<2 East street, he would
I have been drowned.
Alterations are being made In the sewer,
and the boy was playing around the lum
ber. He stepped off the sidewalk into a
manhole and disappeared. Ottosen heard
i his cries and rushed to the manhole. The
i boy had gone down twice, but as he rose
the third time Ottosen caugnt hold of his
arm and dragged him out, more dead than
alive. Policeman Hurley sent the boy to
: the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
' wagon, and he was soon pronounced out
iof danger. He suffered most from sewer
| gas.

McKINLEY INVOLVED
IN THE LABOR QUARREL
Requested to Absent Himself From the
Cornerstone Laying Ceremonies
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, Sept. I.â There is grave danger that the situation between la- #
bor unions and the contractor who Is erecting the Government building will }
result in keeping President McKinley and his Cabinet from attending the Â»S
ceremonies of laying the cornerstone, and may cause a postponement of the *.
ceremonies.
The committee from the lahor unions which called on Postmaster Gordon gÂ»
to-day to state the position of organized labor in regard to the laying of the Â«
cornerstone reports that Mr. Gordon let drop the remark that the President Jf
would probably not come to the ceremonies because of the situation as re- â¦
gards organized labor, and added that the ceremonies might be postponed Â«Â£
until a time when the atmosphere has cleared. This impressed the labor Â£
committee, and the members decided after leaving the postoffice to write *
the President, asking him not to attend any ceremonies connected with the
laying of the cornerstone cut by non-union labor. The stone is now being cut V
by non-union labor at quarries in Maine. cÂ»
GRIGGS CONVINCED
OF CARTER'S GUILT
Court Martial's Findings
Will Be Approved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Sept. 1.-The World's
Washington correspondent says: Attor
ney General Griggs, who has held the Car
ter papers for more than six months, will
hand his decision to the President next
week. Wayne MacVeagh, counsel for Cap
tain Carter, is expected from Kurope souii
and will be summoned to Washington im
tni diately to make his oral argument In
behalf of his client. The World corie
ppondent learns on high authority that so
far as the findings pertain to Carter all ne
they have been tacitly approved. Griggs
is convinced of Captain Carter's guilt. But
this is not all. Griggs believes thai Car
ter was not alone in his peculations, and
it is the "others," so the World is in
formed, whom Griggs is now after.
Captain Carter need expect no quarter
from the Department of Justice, lie must
look to the White House.
Tue army believes Captain Carter guilty
and wants him punished, of course the
opinion of the Attorney General is not
final Witii his report handed in the case
will be up to the President, where it has
been thn*e times before. No one knows
the President's views on the case.
The late president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. Colonel Frank Thompson, Pres
ident McKinley's personal friend ami
companion, did more to interest the Presi
dent in the Carter case than any ether
one man or set of men. Mr. Thompson
thought Carter was innocent. lie ad
vis. >d the President to look further for the
real culprits.
When the President referred tho Carter
papers to Griggs he told him to "dig
deeper than the surface Indications." This
is the administration excuse for delay.

SWIFTWATER'S
"SISTERS" HERE
WITH THE DUST
Loaded With Gold and
Diamonds.
The famous Lamore twins, Nell and
Bell, on whom Swiftwater Bill, the erst
while Klondike millionaire, lavished his
princely fortunes, arrived here Thursday
night from Dawson loaded down with gold
dust and diamonds, and took apartments
at an uptown hotel.
For the last year and a half the petite
actresses have been in Dawson, where
they succeeded in gathering In enough
gold dust to line their nests for the re
mainder of their days. Between them the
girls have a little over $175,000, and al
ready they are making preparations to
build a residence across the bay.
They indignantly deny the story tele
graphed from Victoria a few days ago
to the effect that they were ordered out
of Dawson for making too much money.
"The story is made out of whole cloth,"
said Miss Nellie last night. "Ordered out
of Dawson? Well, I guess not. Why, I've
got valuable property in Dawson and
friends enough to elect me Mayor if I
were a politician. 1 have been in Dawson
ever since April of last year, and dirring
that time 1 followed my profession at the
best theater in town.
"V>-s, I did make a little monoy up
there," admitted the young lady as she
arched her eyebrows and triumphantly
tOÃsed her Huffy bead 7n satisfaction. "I
knew everybody In Dawson and 1 made
plenty of money. What do I Intend to do
now Well, I haven't made up my mind
as yet. Bell and I are thinking of build
ing a nice residence over across the bay,
where we can live comfortably. We do
not intend to go back to Dawson for pome
time. My sister Gussie, who is still there,
will look out lor my interests."
It cost the Lamore sisters nearly $500
to have their saÂ«ks of g"ld dust carried
across the ice tn civilization.
The young ladies sent their wealth to
the Mint yesterday to have it coined into
twenty-dmjar pieces, and it is needless to
mention that they will know how to use
it alter I'ncle Sam changes the dust into
flittering gold pieces stamped with his

Again.
Taken all in nil, the racing furnished
at Oakland track yesterday was about
the best of the Golden Gate Agricultural
Society's meeting. As in other classes i %
sport, the top-notchers have the call,
and It was undoubtedly the big free-for
all trot which attracted the crowd. Start
ing in it were Galette Wilkea, formerly

the pride and pet of the deceased turf
man, Tom Raymond. It looked a hard
bunch to draw from, but past deeds and
recollections made Klamath a slight fa
vorite over Toggles for the opening heat.
He was the same old "Cookie" as of old
whrn it came to the battle through the
home stretch, righting every inch of the
way, but age has dulled his st>eÂ»'d, and
many a hard mile has caused knots to
embellish those iron legs. In the opening
heat he tried his best, but finished third.
lora, handled by Donathan, set a merry
! clip to the stretch, closely attended by
; Toggles. Driver Clark, behind the lat
ter, called on the little bay, and in a furi
ous drive won by half a length in 2:l4'*-
At the paddock it looked as if the heat
would go to Klamath. but the veterans
underpinning grew weary and he left his
feet. At that he was lapped on the lead
ers.
"He'll come back all right," the crowd
said, and Klamath responded to the bell
tap favorite for the second heat. It was
I a repetition of the lirst. Toggles, superbly
driven by Clark, again leading out lora
! by a short half-length, the time being ex
actly the same as for the first heat. Kla
muth broke in the stretch, iinishing third.
Galette Wilkes stepped two nice heats and
will bear watching further down the line.
But one other favorite was beaten dur
ing the afternoon. Arthur W. captured
the 2:15 pace, his second win during the
meet, and in the running end of it Lost
Girl and The Buffoon scored brackets.
Fortis, though a 7 to 10 chance, was de
j feated hands down by Lothian.
Alter playing in hard luck the first heat
with the giant Arthur W in the opening
heat of the 2:16 class pacing event. Reins
man John Quinn came out and took down
the purse in two straight. Dictatress, the
handsome and game daughter of Dic
tatus. owned by J- B. Iverson. the Salinas
horseman, won the opening heat in S:lÂ£tf
and was the contender in the next two,
but slightly outclassed.
The track was then given up to the
runners, the opening number being a
mile selling run. Lost Girl was barred
in the betting, and won at leisure from
Tenrica, the third choice. Yule tired after
covering seven furlongs.
Frank OKane's brown gelding Fortis
made such a phenomenal run on Wednes
day that the mile and a sixteenth event
was considered a gift for him. Starting
an odds on choice he stumbled at the
start and was headed the entiiV distance
by Lomond, a 5 to 1 shot excellently rid
den by novice Walsh. Grady sulked the
latter' part, finishing in the show.
Twinkle Twink was not a. star on this
I occasion.
A cheap band of 2-year-olds lined up in
the final five-furlong scramble. The
Buffoon was installed a warm even mon

Problem for Labor Council
At a meeting of the San Francisco
Labor Council last night the right of dele
gates Ernest Koenig and Arthur Andre of
the Brewers' Association to retain thoir
seats in the council caused a lengthy de
bate. The constitution provides that the
seat of a delegate to the council is for
feited if he accepts a nomination from
any political party. Koenig and Andre
have been nominated for office by the So
cial Democrats. The council was loth to
declare their seats vacant, and finally
Secretary Rosenberg offered an amend
ment to" the constitution, which will ba
voted on at the next meeting, exempting
the Social Democratic party from the op
eration of the law. The question of
whether union musicians should be al
lowed to play at certain theaters on La
bor day was referred to the Musicians*
Union. _

NEUMAN BOYCOTTED
BY A SAWDUST TRUST
A sawdust dealers' combine wa? the
I ent feal ire of the inquest yester
oto the cause of the death of Henry
N-- ;man, who hangod himself last Thurs
day afternoon In his barn, 714 Bryant
â 
The testimony showed that Nouman
riy worked for Adam Neuman, his
father, in the business of gathering, buy
ing and selling sawdust, but upon being
â¢ : j:. Increase of salary he left his
father's employment and went into the
business for himself. I; was not long be
, . n up against a sawdust trust,
â  : ror five firms, and he
complained to his wife that the man from
whom he had been buying the sawdust
had refused to let him have any more.
This seemed to depress him very much.
She told the Coroner's jury that whi-n he

Henry Delger. a member of the San

ry Neuman was not a. member
association. He denied that the or
ganization refused to sell sawdust to non

members.
Weiman, foreman of the jury, ob

the San Francisco Sawdust Assocla
jhould not be lugged into the case.
that the object of the Inquest was to
determine in what manner Neuman came

Coroner Hill replied that his questions
on that subject had been dictated by curi

ELKS STILL AT WAR.
San Francisco and Grand Lodges Join
Issues in the Litigation.
By the filing of an answer yesterday
issues were Joined in the suit of "Golden
Gate Lodge No. 6 of the Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks of the T'nlted
States of America" against the Grand
Lodge and San Francisco Lodge No. 3 of
the same named order. In this action the
plaintiff seeks to recover Its charter, de
rlared forfeited by the Grand Lodge in
1*96 which was transferred to San Fran
ripc'o Lodge together with the parapher
nalia of the plantiff organization.
The story of the fight between the
plaintiff and defendants is well known.
Plaintiff claims its charter was declared
forfeited Illegally. In the answer, how
ever, thl? is denied, it being set forth
that sufficient cause existed for the action
of the Grand Lodge. The defendants aso
claim that the plaintiff is not legally in
corporated and hence has no right to sue.
Therefore the defendants ask for Judg
ment together with costs of action.

SPIRITUALISTS
OF THE STATE IN
ANNUAL MEETING
Standing of Mediums
Defined.
LACK OFFUNDSHINDERS WORK
PRESIDENT QUITS TRYING TO
PLEASE EVERYBODY.
One of the Greatest Problems Con
fronting the Association Is How
to Prevent Members Slan
dering Each Other.
The fourth annual convention of the
California State Spiritualists' Association
opened at Odd Fellows' Hall ye-sterday
morning and will continue until to-mor
row night. Delegations representing the
different, spiritualist organizations were
present. The convention was called to
order by President M. S. Norton. .
'ihe first business was t^ establish the
standing of mediums holding valid rer
tincat?s of ordination, Indorsement or pro
tection Issued by the association. The re
sult of a brief debate was the adoption of
an amendment to the constitution giving
the medium* the same voice in the con
vention as the regularly elected dele
sates.
From the tone of the reports of the offi
cers and the trend of the debate it is
evident that spiritualism has had a hard
row to hoe during the past year. Funds
have not flown into the coffers of the in
stitution at an alarming rate, and medi
ums who have gone out into the highways
and byways to do missionary work have
not found the undertaking profitable. Ac
cording to the report of President Norton
tne organization was confronted at the
beginning 01 am term by a wen organized .
attempt 10 wreck it, tan happily We plans
oi tr.e conspirators were trustrated. ut
the many proDiems with which me con
vention wouia nave to deal he suggested
that the most momentous would be "now
to Disunguisn arm Extinguish Faise Ale- .
diums, " tiow to Get tne Uenuine Article '
froperly Kespected." "How to <Jet 'i'rans
poriation Companies to Carry Spiritualists
and Mediums at Half Price," and finally
"Mow to Keep the Mediums rom &ian
dering Each other." The president said
that ne had tried to piease everybody,
but gave up the task as a hopeless one.
He said that the cost of harmony, liKe
the price ol admission to heaven, some
times came too high.
Secretary T. G. .Newman reported that
the receipts of the association tor the year
amounted to the sum of $135 50. He ha.d
paid $50 to the treasurer and would give
him the balance as soon as he put in an
appearance. The treasurer failed to show
up and the reading of his report went over
until to-day's session.
About thirteen years ago Mrs. Unice
Sleeper deeded to the association in trust
a tract of land at Fremont and Harrison
streets. The purpose of the trust was to
dispose of the property and devote the
proceeds to the purchase of a site for and
the construction of a temple for the spir
itualists of the coast. There has been so
much delay In carrying out Mrs. Sleeper's
wishes that the property has depreciated
in value fully one-half. A committee was
appointed to look Into the condition of the
trust and suggest plans for executing its
provisions. It reported that the funds
available amounted to $17,000, and recom
mended that a spiritualists' temple be
erected at San Jose without delay. The
report will receive consideration at to
day's session.
President Norton, who had added to his
duties as executive officer those of State j
organizer, made some pointed remarks on |
the impossibility of organizing the forces !
and keeping: them organized without re- !
ceiving substantial remuneration for the !
work. He had attempted a little organ- j
izing', but on all sides he was confronted
â¢with a spirit that was entirely wrong.
It was not his kind of a spirit. Supersti
tion and self-interest. fie s"Hid, were some
of the obstacles that he ran up against.
When he sought converts to the spiritual
istic faith the first thing they would ask
him was "What is there in it?" .-

Aldrlch/of Santa Rosa, Mrs, H. M. Hop

SUICIDE AND MISTAKE
CUT SHORT TWO LIVES
Â» G. G. Pohl Dies by Gas
Â» and Annie McMahon
Â» Takes Acid.
k
BUSINESS cares, reverses and
despair drove George G. Pohl, a
dealer in bags and salt at 51
Sacramento street, to a suicidal
death some time during the early
hours yesterday morning. He was 57
years of age. a native of Germany,
and resided at 1603 Webster street.
The manner of his taking-off shows
the determination of Pohl to make
sure of a successful termination of
his work. During the night he left
his bed while his wife was asleep.
She did not know he was away from
her side until she awoke in the morn
ing shortly before 6 o'clock. Every
room in the house was searched, for
Pohl was not accustomed to rise at
such an early hour. To her surprise
she found the kitchen door locked and
an odor of gas escaping from the
room, into which an entrance was
barred.
When the door was forced open
Pohl was found flat on his stomach,
his head hanging over a bucket into
which a rubber tube attached to the
gas jet was pouring its deadly poison.

keeper at 502 Washington street, was
taken to the Harbor Hospital yesterday
by Officer Shaw In a dying condition. Mar
tin is in consumption, and yesterday after
noon had a coughing fit on the front
which ended in the bursting of a blood
vessel. Drs. Dorr and Rice did every
thing possible for the sick man. and a
priest administered the last rites of the
church.
The cruiser Boston is to go out of com
mission in a week or so, Rnd IS7 of her
timp-expired crew will be discharged next
week. The cruiser Marblehead will prob
ably reach here to-day or to-morrow. She
was in Aoapuloo when the Newark sailed.
The lowa will remain here another month
and then she and the squadron will go to
the Santa Barbara channel for target
practice and a series of maneuvers.
Thf Belgian King arrived from San
Diego yesterday and was docked at Mis
sion street. She will be fitted out at once
to carry troops and supplies to Manila.
The George W. Elder is expected to-day
from Portland and the Victoria to-mor
row from Seattle. Both of them will be
used as transports. The Warren with
troops and thp Leelanaw with horses will
probably gel away to-day.
The Grani w>-nt to Hunters Point dry
dock yesterday and thf> Columbia took her
place'at Folsom street wharf. All of thÂ»Â»
dozen transports now in port are being Â«;rÂ»r
r^adj as rapidly as possible and will sail
for Manila within the nf>xt three weeks.
Captains Bollps and Bulger yesterday
exonerated Captain Eagles of the trans
port Centennial from all blame for the
vessel striking a coral reef in the Philip
pines. The reef was not on the chart., and
the chart had been made from Spanish
surveys of fifty years ago.
The Hyderabad's Apprentices
when the British ship Hyderabad was in
port Captain Scott had some trouble with
three of his apprentice boys. They ieft
the ship and the captain reported them as
deserters and refused to pay bills which
they contracted in the city. The Hyder
abad is now on her way to Antwerp, but
the boys managed to get a letter ashore
denying Captain s<ott's statements. They
a'lmit that they di st-rt'-d the ship, hut
did so because the captain would not give
tht-rn proper clothing in which to make
the voyage around the Horn. The hills
!!;.-.â¢ contracted were all with the cap
tain's sanction, and the ship was liable for
them. The boys were R. T. Halnstock.
M. Watklns and A. J. Lewis. When the
Hyderabad reaches England there will be
an investigation and the apprentices will
tell their side of the story. The friends
nf the hoys in San Francisco say they
were not to blame, and the whole trouble
arose over f'aptain Scott's refusal to sup
ply them with oilskins for the voyage
around the Horn.

CASEY NOW
ANXIOUS FOR
HIS FREEDOM
Applies for Another
Writ.
POLICE COMMISSIONERS MEET
SATISFIED THAT CHIEF LEES IS
ON THE SQUARE.
Howard Is Located and His Arrest
Is Expected at Any Time.
"Examiner" Charges
Refuted.
From evident obtained in the last fpw
days the police are convinced that Casey
was one of the men who robbed Wells. \
\ Fargo & Co.'s wagon of $2500. They j
claim that they have positive evidence i
showing that Casey was assisted by Kel- i
ly and Murphy, who are Australian
crooks, and who were with him and as
sisted him In getting away with the plun
der.
According to the detectives Murphy is j
the man who spoke to the driver, thus j
temporarily distracting his attention from
the sacks of coin in his wagon.
Casey and Kelly then stepped up and
got away with the money. It is claimed 1
that they afterward met in a saloon on
Post street, where they divided the plun- |
der. When shown the picture of Murphy
the driver of the wagon positively Iden
tified him as the man wh>> spoke 1Â° him
just before he discovered that the sacks
of coin which were intrusted to his care j
wi re gone.
Chief Lees is sanguine of apprehending
Hnwird, the king of swindlers. It is
known that he has located him and hour- ;
ly expects the welcome news of his ar- \
rest.
Last night the Police Commissioners
held a short meeting and after transact- i
i ing their regular business the subject <>f |
! Howard's transactions was informally I
j discussed. Reporters were not admitted ,
|to the meeting, but it is uthoritatively ;
said that Chief Lees announced that thf
noted swindler had been located and that :
he expected that he would be arrested in
i a short time.
"He cannot escape us." the Chief re
marked. "We have reliable news of his
whereabouts and are confident of get
ting him."
Judge Tobin. the president of the board,
assured the ("hiÂ«f that he had the great
est confidence in him and knew that he j
was doing all in his power to land the ,
Australian swindler. His sentiments were '
voiced by Commissioner Alvord, after j
which the meeting adjourned.
"Jackie" Casey of many aliases ap- ;
peared before Judge Mogan yesterday for i
his preliminary examination on the
charge of "grand larceny by trick and i
device" for getting away with a suit of j
clothes and an overcoat from Felix Bloch,
tailor. He was Instructed and arraigned ;
and Prosecuting Attorney Joachims* n
I asked for a continuance of two days as j
I the people were unable to get two im- I
j portant witnesses.
Attorney George D. Collins, who repre- |
sented Casey, objected and demanded an
immediate hearing. If the prosecution
wanted a continuance, he said, a written |
! affidavit should be filed giving the rea- |
; sons. The Judge ruled that the point was
well taken, and the prosecuting attorney j
' was given time to prepare the affidavit, i
which was sworn to by Detective T. B. ;
Gibson The reasons given were that the
prosecution had been unable to subpena
the landlord of the house on Bush street j
i where Casey lived at the time of ordering
the clothes from Bloch and the messenger ;
boy whom Casey sent for the clothes, pre
tending that Casey was sick and unable |
â ! to call for the garments. The Judge.:
after the affidavit had been filed, granted '
i a continuance till next Tuesday.
Collins in the afternoon applied to Judge
Murasky for a writ of habeas corpus (<>r
I Casey's release on the ground that he
: was being deprived of his liberty unnec
: essarily through Judge Mogan granting
a longer continuance than two days, as
I prescribed in the code. Collins contends
: that in a preliminary examination a legal |
j holiday does not count and the case !
I should be continued till to-day only. The 1
writ was made returnable Tuesday after- |
noon at 2 o'clock.
"MAMMY" PLEASANT
ROASTS THE ASSIGNEE
I The action instituted by aged "Mammy"
| Pleasant against Lucius L. Solomons, in
which George R. Eaton, assignee of !
"Mammy's" estate, has been substituted I
I a? plaintiff, was on. Judge Hunt's calender \
yesterday. In this action the old colored
i woman, who hÂ«Â« gained much unenviable '
j notoriety in the courts, is seeking to re- :
I cover property on Sutter street which she )
! alleges was illegally secured from her by
Solomons, aided by various people.
When the case was called R. Porter
Ashe. who represented "Mammy," said I
that in view of the assignment of her
estate to Eaton for the benefit of cred
ors he wished to withdraw from the case j
in favor of Black & Learning, who repre- I
sent Eaton. This opened the way for j
"Mammy" to express he,r sentiments <m
the case at bar, which she did as follows:
"Youh 'onor, I widdraw, sah. from dis
case to<j. Dat man Eaton he ain't no
good. Dat man nevah. sah should be ,
"lowed in a coat ob justice. He's no good
to 'sociate wid. and. Jedge. I jis keep
'way from him. Dis case is noting surely
but'one o' dem dere fishin' 'scursions, and
I don't want no fishin' 'scursion 'round
me. I nebber will jest know how dat man
Eaton got into dis. nohow. He can't be
trusted 'tall, and I'll just widdraw outen
dis case too."
"Mammy." when she referred to the
case as being a "fishing excursion. "evi
dently forgot that she instituted the ac
tion "and her comment caused consider- '
able' merriment. Z. T. Blakeman was |
present to represent Mrs. Bell, who has |
come into the ease as an intervenor.
Tauszky & Wise appeared for Solomons.
After the withdrawal of Ashe had been
noted an adjournment was taken.
TWO BIG ESTATES.

Lamb Dunn Filed.

the bosses, but they may reflect that

thai it has been disregarded by thi
resentatives of the Committee of One
Hundred. When it Is considered that this
committee emanated fr"ni the Democratic

Gavin McNab ought to be abio to select

I Mayor Phelan should be the last to hayÂ«
: a voice in the selection of candidates for

! to pick out a hoard of twelve men, and it
is a matter of public and judicial record
that he recruited the worst gang that was
I ever mustered into the municipal service.
The Mayor is g 1 at a high jinks, a
church fair, a banquet or a picnic, hut
I when it comes to a question of judgment
regarding the fitness of nv-n for thÂ° public

â  is no guarantee to the convention that he

THE GRAND JURY AND ITS WORK
IJROM the final report submitted by the Grand
Jury the public obtains hardly more than a
commentary upon facts with which it was al
ly fairly familiar. With some of the comment
there wil irse be disagreement, but the dis
nl will be waived as a matter of little con
sequence, because the Grand Jury has taken no ac
tion to enforce its views.
Xaturaliy enough the report begins with a prelude
in the way of explanation and excuse. Reasons are
n why the public should not expect too much,
and tlic reasons are valid, for, as the report -
while extraordinary powers are conferred upon a
Grand Jury it is hampered by considerations
overlooked "A Grand Jury must proceed in accord
ance with law. It may not indict on general pnn
cipli . but i- sworn to judicially weigh the evidence
offen d or obtainable in any given case and to rind an
indictment only when in its judgment the testimony
Â»ult in conviction. It may feel fully as-
Mir - have been committed, but if it
cannot obtain proof that would stand the test of a
i ; hi" law it h;.^ no right to indict, however gi
may b< the popular clamor. An instance of this is
found in the undoubted culpability of 9ome of the
members of the last Board of Education. The jury
jitions were sold and that the city
was defrauded in many ways, but its best efforts
' to adduce any evidence whatever, and it could
consequently find no indictment. There is little
doubt that some of the present Board of Supervisors
been improperly influenced in the discharge of
their official duty, but here, too, no proof could bt
a â¢ ined. In most instances of bribery and corrup
â  no witnesses save the and the
r, both of whom would deny the transaction. To
â¢ books hoping to j. r ;nn proof is wholly use
le->. as such expenditures, if recorded at all, are care
fully covered."
While that statement will be accepted as an exon
n of the Grand Jury, it will have the effect of
new the discussion concerning the efficacy of
grand juries and the general administration of law
in the municipality. When the actions of the late
B iard of Education were under consideration there
v 'â¢â  brought to light am! published in The Call fr.cN
which so clearly revealed fraud in lumber and other
contracts that to the lay mind it appeared the easiest
thing in the world to obtain evidence sufficient to
justify the indictment and the prosecution of the ac
cwd parties, h seems, however, the law officer- of
the city and county thought otherwise, and the Grand
Jury was unable to accomplish anything in that di
rection About the only benefit resulting from the
mvÂ« ' ' vas the awakening of a popular indigna
tion which at the following election brought about
the defeat of the old gang on the Board of Educa
tion and the choice of a better set of men for that
I whole the re;,ort of the Grand Jury may be
summed up a- a random criticism upon county af
fairs without particular relevancy to any i-sue of the
'^ ( are tpld tin Grand Jury thinks some of the
members of the former Hoard of Education were
ible, that some of the present Board of Super
visors have been improperly influenced in the dis
charge of their duties, that prize-fights are debasing
exhibitions and should not be permitted, that there
is something very peculiar about the law which ren
ders exempt from indictment for felony a school of
ficial who accepts a bribe for granting positions in
the schools, and finally we are informed: "The mem
bers of the present jury have shown a readiness to
indict any one who was found to be indictable. Their
actioia lias almost without exception been unanimous.
They have been more than willing â they have been
anxious -to bring to the bar any offender. Too
much i- expected pf a Grand Jury; too little confi
dence is placed in it. If properly aided it can do
much; if left to do all it can do little."
The only conclusion to be drawn from it all is that
i- something radically wrong with our laws for
the prosecution and punishment of corrupt officials.
As the matter stands the most energetic Grand Jury
that can be drawn could accomplish little or nothing.
Thus attention has been directed anew to a great
evil, and for that, at any rate, the Grand Jury de
serves thanks.
REED'S SIDE OF IT.
WHILE it is no doubt true that there is to be
a change in the rules of the House of Repre
sentatives, the change is by no means a re
. turn to the old system, which put the House at the
mercy of one man on the floor and left the majority
and the Speaker helpless. An incautious boast of
| Roger Q. Mills at the beginning of the long session
| in December. 1889, caused the revolution effected by
' Speaker Reed. Mr. Mills declared that the minority
; would use the rules of the House to prevent any
tariff legislation by the Republican majority. This
cpuld be done by the system of alternating motions
and by refusing to answer a rollcall when "No
quorum" was raised. The Republican majority was
so small that to keej> a quorum in place was difficult
if the strong minority broke it by "constructive ab
sence." that is, by refusing to answer when called.
Reed's move was bold and required the nerve and
coolness of a leader of men. The rules had to be
changed in order to defeat the plan of Mr. Mills, but
their change was impossible unless the Republican
majority of ,1 quorum could be made effective. When
the changed rules were before the House, with r t
majority of Republicans present but not a majority
of the whole House, Reed ordered a count of the
members present, not by a rollcall but by tally of
members. He then put the question and the rules
were changed by the vote of the Republican major
ity of a quorum, the minority refusing to vote.
Reed's act was purely arbitrary, but without it the
old way would have continued, and by filibustering
with the alternating motions and constructive ab
sence of silent members who were physically present
the actual majority of the House would have re
mained powerless. In a preceding session, on the
question of the erection of Oklahoma into a Terri
tory. General Weaver of lowa held the House for
days by filibustering, and declared that as under the
rules one man could run the House he proposed to
be that one man. Nothing in our parliamentary his
tory had equaled the rage and bitterness with which
Reed was attacked by the minority. He was threat
ened, derided, denounced and criticized even by mem
bers of his own party, many of whom doubted the
propriety of his action. But he went serenely
through it all. and was not ruffled even when Buck
Kilgore kicked down one of the doors of the cham
ber to escape arrest by the sergeant-at-arms.
When he made any reply to the abuse which raged
around him it was by humor, satire or epigram.
The case went to the country in the Congressional
elections of iS<)O and the Republicans were swept out
of the House, The Democrats elected a majority so
large that the Republican and Populist members
could aii absent themselves and the Democrats had a
majority so largely in excess of a quorum that the
absentees were not missed. Mr. Crisp was elected
Speaker, and then followed the humiliating spectacle
of that large party majority bring so inattentive to
its duty that, to transact the public business at all,
the Speaker was compelled to resort to a modification
of Reed's rules in order to get legislation. The very
members who when candidates had to the people de
nounced Reed with matchless bitterness, by their in
attention to their duty proved the necessity for the
change he made in procedure. When he returned to
the Speakership his rules were elaborated. The
House authorized him to appoint a Committee on
Rules, which practically took charge of the business
of the House. It arranged the order in which bills
should come up, the time given to their discussion,
the share allotted to the majority and minority, and
the hour at which a vote should be taken. There
after when Reed was attacked for the action of this
committee he turned upon his tormentors by remind
ing them that it was the action of tho majority of the
House which ordered the constitution of the com
mittee. While this was true, the charge remained
that the majority had abdicated its function of self
control by authorizing the Speaker to appoint the
committee.
As understood the proposed change by the next
House will involve the appointment of this commit
tee by the House itself, taking from the Speaker the
power to do so. All the other features of the change
proposed are minor in their importance. The Speaker
i to recognize the member who rises first. It is
expected that this will increase the freedom of the
House. But in a body composed of 357 members
and not given to quiet and calmness this amounts to
but little. It was the system long in use before
Reed's time, but "catching the Speaker's eye" was
often very difficult. Upon this the late Ned Mar
shall of California reflected when he was a member
in 185 1. Linn Boyd was Speaker. Marshall's ca
pacity for social enjoyment had so abridged his de
votion to official duty that his term nearcd its end
without a record made on the floor. After trying
every day of the closing fortnight of the short ses
sion to get recognition he turned one day to the
House and said, "I have been in Washington two
year* and have caught everything but the Speaker's
eye." In that he is likely to have many fellow
victims.
The significance of the proposed change is that it
adheres to the purpose Reed had in effecting the
original revolution by leaving the control of legisla
tion in the keeping of th" majority, by giving it the
election of a committee with the same powers as his
Committee on Rules. It is not understood that the
change will reopen the door to filibustering by re
storing the alternating or dilatory motions.
Philadelphia is selfis-h. In fitting out a cargo of
supplies for the relief of Porto Rico care was taken
to fill the ship so full that not so much as a bag of
Leans from another city could be put aboard. That
kind of selfishness, however, is not a kind to be
ashamed of, and the Phillies know it, for they are
bragging of it.
The Democrats" of Ohio have nominated John R.
McLean for Governor by half a vote. The fortunate
nominee will probably look long and vainly for the
other half that would mean an election.
THE WHANGDOODLE ROARETH.
HJ ASTERN Dem6crat3 are conducting their
opposition to Bryan with the qniet, persistent
energy that marks a people of business in
stincts and who trust to organization rather than to
tni>. Southern Democrats of the conservative type
carry on their contest against him with the gravity
of constitutional lawyers arguing much and trusting
to their powers of moral suasion to turn their people
into right paths; but in the roaring region of the
vast Valley of the Mississippi, where the people are
too vehement to argue like Southerners and too out
spoken to plot like Easterners, the fight upon Bryan
is made in a loud, prolonged clamor for another man,
and the noise of it is as the tumult that prevails in
the land where the whangdoodle roareth.
The St. Paul <ilol>e utters its siren shriek in this
wi<;e: "Sailing over the sea from the Far East is the
colossal living figure of American history, a man
with a hand of iron, a heart of exquisite tenderness
and a sense of honor which has led him through
more than threescore years along the path of eternal

right. The Democratic party has but to make this
man the magnet of the campaign upon a platform of
living principles, the central planks' of which shall be
death to the trusts and autonomy for the Philippines,
Cuba and Porto Rico. Upon this platform can
stand the most popular man of the Western Hemis
phere, the idol of the greatest nation on earth, George
Dewey, hero of Manila Bay and admiral of the
American navy."
It is known of course to the Globe as to the rest
of Americans that Dewey is not a Democrat, that he
is not a candidate for the Presidency, that he has
announced that he would not accept a nomination for
the office; but to the Globe all that does not matter.
The one thing it seeks at this time is to turn Demo
cratic attention away from Bryan. If once the wild
steers can be stampeded from the corral of the free
silver man it will be comparatively easy to herd them
into some other corral later on. The thing now is
to start the break. It is for that reason Tammany
plots, the South argues and the wild call for Dewey
comes from the uproarious West. In the meantime
it will be noted Bryan is in no way disturbed. He
meets the plots of the East by counterplots with
silver mine owners, he refutes the arguments of the
conservative South with arguments much more
plausible to the masses, and, as for the Western
clamor, it jars him not at all, for he is to the manner
born, native to the noises, being the greatest whang
doodle of the district.
It is the opinion of the Boston Globe that in the
trial and conviction of General Fitz John Porter
during the war we had a Dreyfus case ourselves â
one in which a gross injustice was done an innocent
man for the purpose of providing a scapegoat for
other generals; and it therefore suggests we
shouldn't be too free in throwing stones at France,
all of which is unkind, because the stone-throwing
doesn't hurt France in the least and amuses us a
great deal.
WHEN Chase was Secretary of the Treasury
women were first employed as Government
clerks in that department. This was their
first appearance in the public service. Opinions as to
the utility of the innovation differed, but even before
the civil service law passed they had appeared in all
of the departments in Washington. As their ap
pointment was then a matter of free choice with the
appointing officers, that they continued to be called
to positions was taken as evidence of their efficiency
and usefulness. In the currency department of the
treasury they were found especially expert. Required
to handle and count old bills in the division of re
demption and new ones in the division of reissue,
they wore found to be more rapid, reliable and cor
rect workers than men. As stenographers and type
writers they seemed to fill confidential positions very
well. They were less diverted by outside matters
than men. and were less liable to the errors of dis
sipation, gambling and other peccadilloes which lead
finally to breaches of public trust. Thousands of
them are now in the civil service, and multiplied
thousands arc dependent on them for support.
It is reported, however, that appointing officers
have ceased to call for them as vacancies or new
places have to be filled, and those in the service find
advancement no longer possible, while those on the
eligible list, qualified by their examination, are ex
cluded by a call for men whenever those lists are re
sorted to. It seems that the civil service law per
mits this discrimination and this permission is gen
erally taken advantage of.
Inasmuch as the entry of women upon service in
the Federal offices preceded their general employment
in private service, in mercantile lines and profes
sional offices, this spontaneous movement toward
official exclusion may mean a general revulsion
against the employment of women in service outside
the public offices. The movement for their admis
sion to both kinds of employment was not concerted.
h had no preceding cult. It had no pressure of ne
cessity, unless eligible men were made scarce by the
Civil War. Is it possible that in the same way,
spontaneously and without concert, the reaction has
bet in, and that its progress will largely exclude
women from occupations and employments that are
now open to them? As it has progressed in the Gov
ernment departments nothing has been said about it
until now its headway has attracted attention.
The only reason so far given is that women are
more inclined to routine and do not turn their hands
from one activity to another as readily as men, ani
that they are averse to overwork and complain
more than men when it is required of them.
But it is strange that these objections have just
now developed after a trial of a third of a century,
during which they have been in the service in such
numbers as to have seriously impeded public business
by the manifestation of either trait.
Probably, if the truth were known, the military
service of many men in the late war has disconnected
them from their former gainful vocations and they
are compelled to resort to the civil service of the
Government lor a living. If this turn out to be the
case another reason is supplied why women should
oppose war instead of being the first to urge it on.
No satisfactory reason has ever been given why
women at the first sign of a chance for a war go wild
in favor of bringing it on. The class of young ladies
in New York who joined in the nagging of President
McKinley, just before the Spanish war, by sending
him the inelegant telegram. "To hell with diplomacy,"
furnished an illustration of this tendency of the
female taste toward battle and bloodshed.
As the matter is becoming serious, it deserves an
intelligent inquiry into this policy of exclusion of
women from public employment, for which they have
proven themselves legally qualified. To prevent it an
amendment to the civil service law may be necessary
which will forbid any discrimination by an appoint
ing officer.
If the movement be one of artifice and design, this
will check it. If. however, its cause be natural, some
thing inherent in the nature of things, such an amend
ment will probably increase the trouble, since noth
ing is easier than to drive women out of employment
by an offensive course which cannot be charged with
either vulgarity or indecency.
Some of the French generals who have made
themselves ridiculous at the court-martial of Drey
fus insist that they have the right to defend them
selves. They probably do not recognize the differ
ence between a right and the ability to exercise it.
The Sultan of Turkey is not noted as a wit, but he
caused a smile recently by teliing a party of British
dignitaries he likes the Swiss better than any other
people in Europe, because they attend to their own
business and send no Embassadors to his court.
To judge from the clamors in our Eastern ex
changes over the rise in the meat market, the price
has been put up so high the mercury can't reach it.
The long-felt want of the campaign against the
Filipinos is to be filled at last. General Otis is to

WOMEN IN CIVIL SERVICE.
HOUSE BUILT ENTIRELY BY WOMEN.
(New York Exchange.)
THREE Chicago women are building
a house.
It isn't a shammy, summer cot
tage either, but a brick house and
stone foundation.
The womenâ Mrs. Franz Liebegut and
her two daughters, Marie, and
"Gustie;" 16â are doing every bit of the
work, from digging: and cementing the
cellar to making mortar and laying the
bricks of the walls.
It is such a departure from the way
that Chicago women usually win notor
iety that the whole northwest part of the
City :s talking about the house that
women are building.
It has now become such an object of
curiosity that the Elston-avenue street- ;
cars stop at Humboldt boulevard to let
the passengers get off and watch the !
women at their wnrk. â¢
They are always at it from dawn till j
sunset, mixing the mortar themselves, j
cleaning the brick, tossing it up. carrying >
buckets of mortar, laying brick, sawing j
timber, doing {he whole thing with afc !

MEMBER OF CASTRO FAMILY
RESENTS UNTRUTHS IN EXAMINER
Sensational Article Printed in That Journal on Sunday Last Character
ized as "Vulgar, Impertinent and Untruthful."
Editor The Call, San Francisco: Will you kindly allow me to contradict,
through the columns of your paper, the vulgar, impertinent and untruthful
"history inserted by Carroll Carrington in last Sunday's Examiner?
On the first page of that paper appeared, embellished with lurid pictures of
the Police Gazette stamp, a so-called history of the < 'astro family. In the sensa
tional sketch we, the Aranos. are represented as a poverty-stricken remnant of
the oner- powerful family, forced to earn our bread by coarse manual labor.
To us<- the writer's own elegant phraseology, he "sloshes around" in a mess
of garbled tacts and absolute untruths in a manner that seems to belong
specially to the penny-a-liner. As to stating the real facts, we do not consider
that the public are sufficiently interested in the pri%-ate affairs of our family to
follow a detailed account of the daily routine of our quiet life. One item in
particular proves that the highly imaginative Mr. Carrington has visions and
dreams dreamsâ his graphic account of "the high-born dames" over Ihe wash
tub, while extremely picturesque, happens to be absolutely untrue. That most
respectable task la performed by one of the sturdy and faithful servants who
have been with us for years.
In conclusion let me beg the very sympathetic Mr. Carrington not to waste
any more of. his maudlin sympathy or unique ability in the historical line on
the Aranos, who are amply able to take care of themselves. If some of his
misdirected energy should be turned to the cultivation of common sense and
a decent regard for the private rights of others, it would prove a blessing to
himselfâ and to the persecuted public. Very truly yours, AMELIA ARANO.

FREAKS OF THE LAW.

Thomas J. Kirk has been puzzling his

teacher by a board of which her husband
is a member?" Not arriving at a satis
factory conclusion he submitted the in
quiry to Attorney General Fold. The lat
ter in an opinion quoted the code which
states that "No school trustee or mem
ber of any. Board of Education must be
interested in any contract made by the
board or which he is a member. Any con
tract made in violation of this provision
is void. He contends that the engaging
of a teacher's services is a contract and
further calls attention to the rulings of
the Supreme Court to the effect that the
earnings of a wife while she is living
with her husband are community prop
erty, and the husband has the manage
ment and control of all community prop

SAID TO BE DUE TO A PULL
COLONEL SMITH WARMLY DE
FENDED BY HIS MEN.
They Declare Him to Be a True
Soldier and Say He Has Been
Slandered by His
Enemies.
As has been the case with every volun
teer regiment that has thus far returned
from the Philippines, the First Califor
nia boys have a few kicks coming. There
is hardly a man or oihcer in the entire
organization, fr.mi the battalion com
: manders down, who is not indignant at
' the Injustice that they claim has been
to Gem ral Jin; Smith in the reports
that have been circulated here concern
ing his popularity in the regiment he
: once commanded. They say that at all
! times and under all circumstances he did
his duty and that if there ever was any
| feeling against him it was when the boys
w< â  I 'ng time in j:a'Tisi>n and had to
gr^>wl against some one. Naturally they
. .I,'ainst Smith, as all troops are
wont to growl against a commander once
in a while. These little ebullitions
they say, n.Lve been so magni
fied at home as t" have resulted in con
slderable undeserved criticism
mander whom they all respect and than
whom no braver ever led - iiattle.
regiment is almost unanimous in re
gretting his .-â  From it. and the
men say they have many a time wished
be was once mere over them.
There have, been many petty individual
ferences engendered during the last
fifteen months, but these ihe men and
officers alike refuse to discuss for publi
cation. They say that now the war is
over, as far as they are concerned, and
the regiment is home once more, oid
sores should be allowed to heal or at
si bandaged by esprit de corps; they
ild be bidden from the sight of the
public.
There are a few things, however, that
they are willing to talk about, not
the sake of causing scandal, but in order
that the people may not misconstrue
things and reiuse to fcive honor where
honor Is due. These matters are mostly
connected with the recent promi
which seem to have given as much uni
versal dissatisfaction as anything could
;â ( ssibly â¢ ngender.
It Is not the promotions from the ranks
, against which this criticism is l<
j Tne verdict seems to be that they are
I about right. Hut it is the promotions
among the commissioned officers that
have set the ball of discord rolling. Â£o
genera] is this kick that there s-.-ems to
.: fficer who has escaped the
universal â¢'knocking" which is now going
on. This Isolated case is the one of Cap
, tain Curzons, the regimental adjutant,
who bas Just en promoted from the
position of first lieutenant. The ni
ne is a good officer who deserved his ad
vancement for bis courage aa weil as for
his other soldierly qualities. They say
rliat inasmuch a> Â£;in>- was by far the
best volunteer officer In the Philippines,
and as his merit was recognized by the
regular officers there to such an extent
that they paid him th> compliment of
making: him the senior major of a reÂ«u
--( lar cavalry regiment, and that the date
' of his commission makes him the senior
oi Colonel Dul ild that gentle
man accept the commission procured for
him. tno Stat>- "f I alifornia should at
â¢ least have shown him an e<iual courtesy
by making him the lieutenant colonel of
the regiment he did so much to distin
guish, even though the title should have
been merely an honorary one. his presi at
position not permitting of his acceptance
of the acti\ - office.
Next to Sim^ the choice of the regiment
seems to favor Captain O'Neill, command
ing Company M. O'NeiU*a claims a,re
; based on the record for gallantry he has
; made which, in the opinion of the regi
'â  ment. is strong enough to more than
I the claims of seniority which
possessed. O'Neill was recommend
ed for th>- rank of major, but learning
that his acceptance would place in com
â¢ ts company a man whose â¢â¢
under tire would mak'- him ridiculous In
on, but who, notwithstand
ing Eaci that his reputation was
known throughout the <n!ir< regiment,
had been recommended for promotion on
the ground of seniority, O'Neill refused
the advancement ;m<l decided to remain
inmand of Company M as a plain
â  am.
A thing which has angered Company
L is the fact that though every other
first sergeant in the regiment received the
. . der Btraps, their senior enlisted man,
Frank Grundman, was overlooked like a
white chip and Bergeani Major liadt was
â¢ nd lieutenant when Adler
â¢ : his promotion. The mÂ«n say
they have no kick coming against Badt,
as he is a good man and a good soldier,
but they say Grundman is equally ex
cellent as a man and a soldier and as
as they make them. Therefore they
argue he should not have been over
looked, particularly as there are more
i <than enough vacancies to go around, as
â  is evinced by some of the companies get
i ting two promotions from th.' ranks. If
I Duboce. they Bay, was so technical about
; his recommendations for seniority alone,
1 he couid not in fairness have overlooked
Grundman, who has a good record to
back his seniority of non-cummissjon.
These are only a few of the kicks in
tr..- matter of promotions; there are many
others. A sergeant summed the whole
! situation up when be Bald: "Record cuts
! no figure. While some promotions are de
s.-r\>-d, there is not one based on merit
alone. It's a case of pure simple pull,
and the fellow having the strongest drag
i pets there. Tin- men of the regiment are
all right, and so are many of the officers,
; but until pollti' a and favoritism are elim
i inatcd from it. it will never show what it
is really capable of. Jim Smith was the
â  man who knew how things should be
I done."
Colonel Duboce. when seen regarding
' the complaints, said that he could not dis
i cuss the matter further than to say tne
i men he re.comm>-nd'-d for promotion were
; entitled to recognition on account of the
' seniority of their rank and because there
was nothing officially against them.
I whatever their reputations might be
i throughout the command.
The enlisted men and many of the offi
cers laugh at this. They say that while
i many who received promotions deserved
j them, yet there were others who have
| got honors to which they are not en
titied, and that when the regular army
! men, who know something about senior
ity and other red tape affairs, selected a
j man on whom to confer distinction, they
! chose Sime, who had neither seniority or
! pull to back him up, but whose only roc
ommondation to favor was his gallant
; record as a soldier.
VOLUNTEERS INVITED
TO VISIT THE CHUTES

nave. If they will call at headquarters .n
the California Hotel to-day they will re
ceive tickets admitting them to" the ban

The great difficulty that the employment
committee is contending with is that many
employers desire to give" employment im
mediately to the volunteers, while the lat
ter will not be mustered out for two or
three weeks. Rabbi Voorsanger has pre
pared a circular embodying a request for
assistance from employers, and 3000 have
j already been mailed. The responses, how
; ever, have not been as prompt as the com
mittee could wish.
Places were obtained for several dis
charged volunteers, but there are many
more who will be in urgent need of work
I after they have been released from army
j service.
A reception will be tendered this evening
at 3WS Mission street to the Mission mem

ADMIRAL SAMPSON
IS TO BE RELIEVED
At His Request Will Bs Permitted to
Relinquish Command of the
Squadron.
WASHINGTON, Sept. I.â At the con
clusion of the Dewey celebration at New
York Admiral Sampson will be relieved
of the command of the North Atlantic
squadron. This action is to be taken at
the request of the admiral, who has al
ready had much more than his portion
of sea service in his grade. After a short
leave of absence he will be assigned to
shore duty, probably in command of one
of the navy yards.
In considering the selection of Admiral
Sampson's successor as commander-in
chief of the North Atlantic station the
Navy Department has practically nar
rowed i he field down to two names. It
has been laid down as the policy to be
followed that the commands of fleets and
.stations shall be reserved, wherever prac
ticable, for the nine rear admirals of the
first grade. It has been found that of
these officers who are not already on sea
Bervice or about to retire shortly there
are three names â Remey, in command at
Portsmouth; Farquhar, commandant at
Norfolk, and Schley. president of the re
tiring board. Farquhar has been longest
on continuous shore duty and it is in
dicated that either he or Remey Is to
succeed Sampson.
MORE REGIMENTS
FROM THE EAST
ARE ON THE WAY
Arrival of Part of the
First Two.
THE THIRTY-FIRST IN AHEAD
LAST OF THE RECRUITS BEING
SENT AWAY ON THE WARREN.
Falling Away of the Numbers That
Have Been Reporting â Meet
ing of the Red Cross
Ladies.
The vanguards of two regiments of in
fantryâtwo of the ten new ones author
ized by Congressâ have arrived at the
Presidio. The Thirty-first, from Fort
Thomas, Kentucky, came with two bat
talions, and later in the afternoon came
the headquarters, band and the First Bat
talion of the Thirty-fourth, from Fort
Logan, Colorado.
The Thirty-llrst was the first of the new
regiments to be recruited and to report
for duty. It is commanded by Colonel
James S. Pettit, formerly a captain in the
First United States Infantry. The two
battalions which arrived yesterday came
under command of Lieutenant Colonel
Webb C. Hayes, son of ex-President
Rutherford B. Hayes and formerly a ma
jor in the Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. Col
onel Hayes was all through the campaign
in Cuba, most of the time doing duty on
the staff of General S. B. M. Young. He
was wounded at San Juan and had two
horses shot under him during the advance
on Santiago. With him are Major Lloyd
W. Brett, commanding the First Bat
talion, and Major Hunter Liggett, com
manding the Second Battalion. The Third
Battalion is expected to arrive this morn
ing, under command of Major E. Mc-
Mahon. Colonel Pettit will arrive with
the remainder of his regiment this morn-
Ing. The other^officers on the regimental
staff are: Surgeons Major James W.
Heney. Captain Alvln S. Hawkins and
Lieutenant K. S. Porter; Captain J. Van
Ness Philip, adjutant, and Lieutenant B.
Stark, commissary.
The Thirty-first started from Fort
Thomas Saturday morning. It is made
up of recruits from Ohio. Indiana, Ken
tucky and Tennessee, and among its men
it has a number of members of families
from the Interior of Kentucky who have
been actively engaged in feuds of more or
Less long standing. There are some mem
bers of the Hatfleld-McCoy feudal fac
tions and some Bakers anil sumt; How
ards. The fighters have all agreed to quit
as long as they remain in the service,
however, so there is no fear of any more
fighting than that caused by the Filipinos.
The first two battalions of the Thirty
fourth came in under command of Major
Shunk and Major Peck. In all there are
about 450 men.
Neither the Thirty-first nor the Thirty
fourth regiments will remain long at the
Presidio. The Thirty-first is booked to
sail on the transport Sherman as soon as
ahe can be got ready, and the Thirty
fourth will sail soon after. It has been
the custom to keep the men for the Phil
ippines at the Presidio for at least a
month, in order to give them plenty of
time for target practice: but there "will
be no delay in the case of the regiments
here and coming here. In the case of the
Thirty-flrat the lack of practice will not
be felt so badly, for the men of that com
mand have already had from a week to
ten days of practice before they started
for this coast.
The following regiments are on the way
here: The Twenty-seventh, from Camp
Meade, left there on August 29. The
Twenty-sixth leaves Plattsburg on Sep
tember 5 and the Thirtieth will leave
about the same date from Fort Sheridan.
The Thirty-second is to leave Fort Leav
enworth about September 16.
The recruit camp at the Presidio will be
cleaned out this morning. With the sail
ing of the Warren with over 1100 men the
last of the available rookies will have left
the post. It Is the first time since the
recruit camp was started that it has been
anywhere near empty, but lately the
transports have been carrying away more
than the recruiting offices have been send
ing, and so the number of men available
has been steadily growing smaller.
Three months ago men were coming in
at an average of over 100 a day. Then it
fell to eighty a day, then to sixty, and
now there are days when none come at
all. The recruiting of regiments In thÂ«,
East has had its effect, and many m<n
who would otherwise have come to the
post as recruits will come as members of
the new volunteer regiments; but still
there is no doubt of the fact that the
number of recruits is becoming less ana
less. At one time there were over 4000
men in the various camps, and their ac
commodation became a matter for serious
consideration, but that time has passed.
There will be 4000 and over for a while if
all the regiments from the East come to
gether here, but it will be for a short
time only, and then the camps will have
to denend on recruits again.
Six 'hundred and fifty of the men for the
Warren went down to the vessel yester
day; the remainder of her complement
will be put aboard this morning. Of these
, men 296 are for the Thirty-sixth Infantry,
2&4 for the Thirty-seventh and 45 for the
Eleventh Cavalry.
A committee from the citizens com'
mittee called at the headquarters of the
First California Regiment yesterday to
leave with Colonel Duboce some books for
the gathering of statistics regarding the
men of the regiment, for use in finding
| employment for those who may not have
work when they are mustered out. On
i the committee were Rabbi Voorsanger,
1 Mr. Vail and Mr. Benedict. Later the
j executive committee called on Colonel Dv
: boce, and the matter was once more dis
cussed.
The books left for distribution to the
captains of the First California and the
California Artillery when filled out will
I contain the name, age, residence, former
employer and occupation of each man.
They will be given to the captains this
morning, and Colonel Duboce has prom
ised that they shall be filled out without
delay. The Information they contain will
be compiled in a register, and when the
commands are mustered out the commit
tee will be able to act at once for those
| who have not been able to provide them
â  selves with work.
I The officers of the First California Regi
ment have decided that they will re-enter
I the service of the State within sixty days
! afUT they have been mustered out of the
j United States service. About half of the
j non-commissioned officers of the regiment
have declared the same intention, and it
j is understood that a majority of the men
I will also re-enlist in the National Guard.
! The regiment will give up its arms next
Monday.
There will be trouble for some of the
men from the heavy artillery if they do
! not pay more attention to guard duty than
they have been paying. It has happened
that when the time for guard mount came
there has been an absent list that usually
includes the same men, and there are four
or five whose places on the guard have
had to be filled by their comrades regu
larly since the men went into camp. Ma
ijor'Rice is going to put a stop to any
thing of that kind, and yesterday he or
dered the battery commanders to prefer
charges against any of their men who
! were detailed on the guard and who were
1 absent from guard mount. They will be
; warned or perhaps will be given a turn
; at police duty as a reminder, and if there
: is more absence a turn in the post guard
i house will be added. Major Rice says he
does not wish to be hard on the men,
! particularly at this time, but there is one
duty that must be performed, and that is
â  guard duty. If there is any one detailed
lon the guard who does not report for
duty some one of his comrades must take
his place, and Major Rice will not let any
of his men impose upon the others.
The rolls of the Colorado regiment were
all linished yesterday and were sent in
to the paymaster. The rcgimem will be
mustered out on September 3.
The Wyoming battalion will proDably be
mustered out oetween Septwiib'.-r 21 and
Zl. The Idaho men and the North Da
kota men will follow very soon after.
Yesterday afternoon the Governors,
Senators and Congressmen who are here
| to receive the returning volunteers trom
| their several States were the guests of
! General Shafter at luncheon. They met
I at the Presidio yesterday morning and
i were driven around the post and out to
' the fortifications on the heights ovenook
ing the Golden Gate. Then they were
driven to the PaclQC Union Club, where
they had luncheon. A salute from Light
Battery C. Third Artillery, was tired as
I they came into the post. Assisting Gen
eral Shatter in the entertainment of the
guests were Major Robert Noble, :ii<l on
the general's staff; Captain Sedgwick
Pratt, artillery inspector of the depart
ment, and Captain Frajik Greene, signal
officer. The party was a most enjoyable
! one. The entertainment of th'-'so uistin-
I guished guests properly belongs to tr.e
! Uovtinor of this State, Dut he lias shown
no desire to put himself out ;n order to
be gracious, nor has he taken any interest
in Uielr welfare.
There were two promotions announced
in the Wyoming battalion yedtprday. Sec
ond Lieutenant Charles Pinney was mu-ie
a lirst lieutenant anil First Sergeant
Henry A. Smith was made a seconÂ«l lieu
tenant.
The expected appointments of majors in
' the First California Regiment are still
unannounced. There is some feeling be
ing shown at the delay, for tne holding:
back of the appointments \z only keeping
back two promotions all along the line.
â  Under a recent ruling of the Wn.r Depart
i me.'it there cun be put two majors ap
pointed, for the regiment must be kept
to the old National uuard standard, which
I provided for only two majors, the lieu
! tenant colonel being in charge of tne lirst
battalion. When these two majors have
been appointed there will be room tor two
more captains, two more 'irst teutenanta
and two more second lieutenants, which
will let two men ris>- irura mt ranks j:iiJ
be mustered out with shoulder straps.
Then u> till the vacancies formed amu-.ig
the first sergeants there will be promo
tions right through the non-commissioned
officers, and two privates will finally put
on chevrons just in time to earn the title
they carry. .
Tnere are four vacancies in the Idaho
1 regimentâ that of lieutenant colonel and
three lieutenants. They will proDably be
filled by Governor .Steunenberg within a
day or two. ,
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Red Cross Society yester
day it was decided to fix the dues at $1
a year payable on October 1. It was also
decided to" move the headquarters to the
R. i Cross tent in Union Square.
The treasurer, Mrs. Harrington, reported
a balance on hand of $0761 88. A special
vole of thanks was given the Market
Street Railway Company for a donation
of $1500. A vote of thanks was also
passed to the Southern Pacific Company
and all its connecting lines for special
rates they had made for some of the
needy volunteers. The Colorado boys
were not forgotten, and a vote of thanks
was tendered them for the assistance they
had givej) in preparing for the great cele
bration. , . Â_.
It was reported that during August 10l
nun had been assisted home at a cost of
$370 60 and employment had been found
for sixteen at a cost of $62 40.
A letter was read which informed the
society that SOW medals would be deliv
ered to the men who were in service, and
in case of a man being killed or having
died his nearest relative would be given
his medal. â¢
Attention was called to the memorial
services which will be held in honor of
those who gave their lives in the service
to-morrow. The services will be held in

The Populist, the official paper of Gov

that the Governor will refuse to call a
special session of the Legislature to pro
vide means to bring the troops from San
Francisco. It also states that he will re
fuse to authorize the issue of emergency
warrants, which means that State war
rants will have to be registered wirhin a
few days, but it is not likely that any of
them will be for more than a short time.
The Populist also announces that Public

ing crooked work in the management of
the penitentiary, the reform school and
the insane asylum under former manage

out a report, etating that it will be pub

Territorial of

THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT
WERE PUT TO THE HAWAIIANS
1. \What form of government is, in your opinion, best suited for the Hawaiian Islands?
2. Should the judiciaryâ the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court, either or both â be clect
r appoim l k>e, and for life or for a term of years.'
j. Ik' you favor the retention- in office of the present judiciary, regarded from the stand
point of principle or utility and apart from any personal feeling?
4. Do xou consider it to our best interests that the officers to be appointed by the President
c United Slates, in the event of a Territorial form of government, should be selected from
residents of the {'proposed) Territory or from the mainland.'
Would you prefer that the oilier officers of the Territory should be appointed by the
Governor or elected by the people?
6. Are xo.u in favor of retaining the penal contract labor lazes. 7 If not, hare you any
suggestion to make in connection therewith to protect the employers of labor in their investments?
j. I :â : any suggestions to make in regard to the labor problem of procuring suffi
cient labor for the needs of our plantations and other industries/
5. Who. â â  opinion in regard to the franchise.' Should universal suffrage or a re
stricted one be granted.' How would you deal in tins respect with native-born Hawaiian*) whether
native or Asiatic races?

HON. JOHN M. HORNKR, planter, Ku
kaiu, Hamakua, Hawaii:
1. A Territorial form of government,
by all odds, and of the most liberal
kind.
Such, in fact, as are enjoyed by the
people of Territories on the mainland.
Let them have plenty of freedom, as
freedom is said to be "God's road to de
velopment and civilization." Surely all
Territories require both.
When we undertake by force to reg
ulate the lives of other people we as
sume responsibilities which Providence
has not placed upon us, and we thus
disregard that heavenly law that de
mands "Whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to them."
This would apply to Hawaii, Porto
Rico, the Philippines and to control our
actions with all the world.
2. The Supreme Court should be appoint
ed), but only for a term of six or eight
years.
If Judges are elected but few are inde
pendent enough not to be swayed by cir
cumstances that may arise to prevent or
assist in their re-election.
3. I have no personal objections to our
present judiciary- If appointed or elected
as In answer to question 2. In fact, would
consider it judicious to appoint and elect
them for tilling the first judicial term un
der our Territorial government.
4. Under a Territorial form of govern
ment, as a rule, the appointees of the
President should be selected from resi
dents of th" Territory, I reason that a
man â¢residing' here knows more about the
wishes and what would be for th" well
being of the people than would a stranger
whose sympathies are not with the people
and. cannot be until they become ac
quainted.
Besides, It seems to- me a people -who
glory in freedom and Independence as do
th-> people of the United States should
abandon entirely the old English colonial
system of appointing from the "main
land" the big officials for her colonies.
We have capable men here.
5. The officers of the Territories should
surely be elected by the people of the
Territory, as
then, after trial,
if they did not
suit they could
lie dropped. If

merits, as if the Governor was appointed
from the mainland and only the Presi
dent to please he may import his rela
tions and friends to fill the more im
portant offices, regardless of the best in
terests and well wishes of the people of
the Territory. Such an independent course
would naturally engender hard feelings,
as was the case in the old colonial days.
It is a wrong course to pursue. It
takes away the people's independence,
whereas. they should be allowed as much
freedom here a:- in any Territory of the
United States. If not, why?
6. I am in favor of a contract labor law
without a penal clause. As the woeful
meaning of our present contract is Inter
preted by some spiteful writers, although
not a word of truth in them, yet their
writings are so extensively circulated they
will always count against us. hence I
would strike it out and stop their grumb
ling and their holding us up to the world
as "grasping-, cruel, unchristian slave
drivers." I would strike it out for that
reason and have peace in the family.
7. I have this to say: If our present and j
future Government will so favor our fn- ]
dustries as to !
permit them to
get labor where
it is to be had,
then there will
be no check to
our material
prosperity, but
if our Govern
ment continues
I Obtain
Labor Where
Available.
Its present policy of refusing to permit the
, importation of labor from Asia unless a
certain per cent of Europeans or Ameri
! cans are also imported and do not let it
be known where and how they can be
obtained, then a dark cloud overshadows
our industries, although prospects are
bright but for this dark shadow.
8. All males 21 years of age without re
gard to race or color who were born,
schooled and reared in these islands, and
.'ill males 21. years old who are residing
\ here when our Territorial organization
â  lies into effect and can read and write the
English language, should be granted the
right of franchise.
NICHOLAS RUSSELL, M. D., coffee
planter, Hawaii.
1. Colonial. Because, considering
the whole history of these islands,
as well as the present ethnographical
and economical situation, the representa
tive form always was and will remain
fictitious and only hampering progress.
The government by a Governor appointed
by the President of the United States, if
a proper person Is selected, viz.. a man
with progressive views, strong personal
ity and intellect, entirely out and above
all local party feelings and connections,
, animated with nothing else but a desire
to promote the general welfare of the
country, and endowed with supreme
power to do so, alone will be able to
counteract the rapidly developing oli
garchy of a few huge sugar plantations,
to the detriment of the country.

universal suffrage of all residents of

4. Indifferent, provided they be intel

o. Appointed by the Governor.
6. I am positively against the penal
clause, which is a survival of servitude
altogether contrary to the spirit of the
age and perfectly unnecessary. The In
terests of the employers and condition of

tected by abolishment of all obstacles
to free emigration of laborers from all
countries Including Japan.

dent of the Board of Health,, Hono
lulu; Hawaiian born.
1. A Territorial form of government,
very much upon the lines laid down by
the Commissioners in the bill which they
reported to Congress..
2. In my opinion the Judges of the
Courts of Record, Supreme Court and
circuit Courts should be aDDointed: the

3. 1 an; in favor 01 the retention in of-
Bee of the present Justices and Judges
of the Courts of Record. The Incum
are men of ability and Integrity and are
familiar both with the Judicial system of
these islands and of the United Btates.
4. I do consider that it would be best
that the Territorial officers be appointed
from among residents of the Territory.
Organized government has been main
tained in these islands ror many years
and then- is sufficient material from
which to select competent anfl well qual
ified persons to lill the Territorial offices.
I 5. I approve of the system recommended
I by the Commissioners, viz. that the Gov
j ernor be appointed bj the President of the
â  United States and that the other princi
pal officers be appointed by the Governor
with the approval of the Hawaiian Sen
ate.

1. An independent Government of
â¢ our own, as existed prior to the
overthrow; but as this seems to be
denied us, then some Territorial form in

2. In my opinion, the Supreme Court
should be appointed by some local tri
bunal, say, for instance, the Legislature,
and should only be removed for cause by
! the appointing power. As for the Circuit
Court, I am opposed to the elective sys
tem when applied to the judiciary, and 1
i advocate that the same be appointed as
. above, but for a term of years, say four
years.
3. With a few exceptions, I think the
present judiciary should be retained, for
it will be a very difficult matter to re
place them with men who so thoroughly
understand the traditions, prejudices and
! requirements of this country: and in the
event of radical changes . which are apt
to be made in our laws the present ju

2. The Judges of the Supreme Court
should be appointed by the Governor of
the Territory for life, and the Circuit
Judges for three years by the Governor.
3. a court of last resort should be com

opinions should be founded upon the law
and the evidence as presented, and they
should be able to recognize that the con

must confess that I fear that the work

decisions cf the United States courts, ex

ment.

With the local customs and conditions,
particularly as relates to Hawaiian rights
and customs, i. c.. the native race, whi
should be regarded as wards of the Gov
ernment and dealt with as such as long
as they last.
3. As stated on the preceding page, the
customs and rights of native Ila-.vaiiir.s
should be a prime factor in selecting the
Judges. For this reason the present
Judges are probably better qualified than
any strangers that could be selected. The
men in office are no doubt better qualified
for the service than any new men could
be.
4. Yes, provided that thÂ«Â»y have given
satisfaction and are in all respects pos

B. The franchise should not be permitted
to any one who cannot read, write and

Hawaii. Any man or woman who can
show this qualification may safely be
trusted with the honor.

6. I think my answer to Question 4
covers this question, but I may add that
all officers others than the heads of bu

( To repeal the penal contract labor
laws means ruin to very many of our new
plantations. Labor laws now in force in
Hawaii can be modified by our local Leg
islature so as to give them a better work-
Ing force upon the laborers without re
sorting to penal servitude.
7. <!â â ::;> labor has been the "main
stay" of Our plantations. If our planta
tions can obtain cheap laborers from the
United States or Europe, get them, or
<â¢!*<â  they cannot escape curing such
labor from a place other than the United
States or Europe.
S. Franchise should he based on educa
tion. Native-born Hawaiians, whether
of the native or Asiatic races, are native
Hawaiians; if they are educated here or
abroad, and such education has been In
English, they must have the franchise.
08. EMERSON. M. D., Hawaiian
born, Honolulu.
1. I think a Territorial form of
government, administered by a
Governor with the assistance of a Legis
lature elected by the people, is the Gov
ernment best suited to the Hawaiian
Islands.
2. In my opinion the judiciary. includ
ing both the Supreme and Circuit courts,
should be appointed for life â or good be
havior.
3. I would favor the retention in office
of the present judiciary, also that all new
appointees to the judiciary should be se
lected from among the legal fraternity
resident here.
4. I have no hesitation in saying that in
the event of the establishment of a Terri
torial form of government the best inter
ests of the country would be served by
the appointment to office of men selected
from among the residents of the new Ter
ritory.
5. I think in general that all officers of
the Territory should be appointed by the
Governor.
6. It seems to me that the penal element
in our contract laws had better be
abolished. I believe that the observance
on the par* fit tfje employer of. strict .
Justice and kindness toward the employe,
the avoidance of the system of "ad
vances." and not permitting the employes
to go into debt will be of service In de
fending the interests of the employer.
7. 1 believe that the system of profit
sharing has in it elements of equity which
make it desirable that it should be used
as an inducement to the coming in of the
better class of laborers into our planta
tions.
Every effort should be made to adapt
our methods to the employment of a class
of intelligent laborers and profit-sharers
on our plantations. It would be a great
pain â¢â !â  the part of the employer if all
those interested in the employment of la
bor in this country were to enter Into an
agreement with each other by which those
laborers who broke contracts or other
wise soueht to defraud their employers
wore denied employment on other planta
tions until such time as they had satisfied
all just claims against them.

HON. A. V. OEAR, member of the Leg
islature. Honolulu.
1. A Territorial form of government
for the present, with the prospect of
. aa soon as the island p i\m
lation becomes sufficiently Americanised.
2. I believe that the judiciary should be j
appointive, and that the appointments â 
should be for a term of years, and not for
life; appointive because I fear that polit
ical campaigns are not likely to produce
the best qualified Judges; and for a term
of years because Judges appointed for life
cling to tneir offices long after sickness
and old age render them incompetent; and
further, because I believe that life ap
pointments tend to render the Judges len
careful in preparing decisions based on
law and justice.
3 I believe that a judiciary which has
been so long accustomed to render deci
sion? based in part on the "peculiar con
ditions of Hawaii," as evidenced in their
late decisions overruling the constitution
of the United States, which are filled with
labored and fallacious reasoning, should
not be retained in office. Decisions should
never be judicially rendered unless based
upon law and justice, no matter what '
friendly interests may be hurt thereby
4 I believe that appointed officers should \
be filled from residents of the islands,
with the possible exception of the Federal i
Judge, who might well be selected from
the mainland, as he should be thoroughly
conversant with American laws, and one '
whose interests are not interwoven with 'â 
those of Hawaiian capitalists either com- j
mercially or otherwise. _
5 I should prefer that the other officers j
be appointed until such a time as the I
islands become thoroughly Americanized.
6 No. I am not In favor of retaining the
penal contract-labor laws, and I consider '
that they were doc e away with, wfcea tfce
HEREWITH IS PRESENTED A
SUMMARY OF THE VIEWS ENTERTAINED.
\TINETY per cent of those intcniezved believe a Territorial form of government the most suit
able for the islands.
Only three favor the colonial plan, while one oilier is of the opinion that the monarchy
should be restored.
The appointment by the President of the United States of the members of the judiciary is
favored by a large majority.
There is but little opposition to the retention in ofh.ee of the present judiciary.
The consensus of opinion as regards the officers for the proposed Territory to be 'appointed
by the President is that they should be selected from among the residents of the islands.
There is a division of opinion as to whether the other officers for tlie Territory should be
appointed by the Governor or elected by the people.
A large majority emphatically declares wi favor of the repeal of the penal contract labor
lazes.
Numerous suggestions arc offered regarding the solution of the vexatious labor problem.
The granting of the franchise to all native-born and naturalised citizens of the Territory is
favored by most of the Hawaiians. Some think the franchise should be restricted by educational
or brobertx Qualifications.
American flag was raised here, notwith
standing the decisions of the Supreme
Court to the contrary.
I believe that the employers of labor
should look to their own protection in
their investments, and that with proper
treatment of their laborers there will b*Â»
no serious difficulties in the labor market.

the American system of free laborers.

GILBERT F. LITTLE, lawyer, Hilo.
1. A Territorial form of government
is the only one to be considered. No
other form is consistent with the prin
ciples of the republic of the United
States, and until formulated into a State
the United States as a sovereignty has
the inherent power to govern at discretion
such Territory. That is safest and best,
and 1 therefore favor it.
2. The tenure of the local Supreme Court
and Circuit courts is governed by Con
gresa in Territories of the United States,
and for the present this system should
not be disturbed. The appointment of a
Federal Judge by the President for life
would not be objectionable.
3. I do not favor the retention of the
present judiciary for obvious reasons. A
reference to its history will convince any
one of th> â¢. for a change. Re
garded from a standpoint of both princi
ple and utility the slate should be washed

of soda water statesmen are neither Re
publican, Democratic nor American. They
seem to be above instruction or sugges

knowledge of conceit; they deny freedom
of thought ur action to all who are not
under their own .special guidance or con
trol. We want none of them retained in
office or reappointed, and as little as pos
sible of the present form of government
embodied in our organic act.
5. Federal officers should be appointed
by the President; Territorial officers by
the Governor, and purely local officers
elected by the people.
6. The present contract labor laws mean
when properly interpreted abject slavery.
It means under our practice that you can
am Bt and imprison a person at hard la
bor for the breach of a civil contract in
the absence of fraud, or fine a man as a
criminal in such a case. No self-respect
iner American citizen could in honor sup
port such a contract.
7. I are not an expert on the labor prob
lem, but the everyday experience of
American residents here has developed
the fact that if the planter would be will
ing to divide all profits above 33 1-3 per
<ent net on his investments with his la
borer* in the form of Increased wages tha
labor problem would instantly solve it
self.
t Universal suffrage should be granted

'.. Elected.
6. 1 am not. I think in a very short
time all the plantations will lease out
their lands to growers and make contracts
with them to purchase the cane they raise.
This is a practical solution of the prob
lem. The laborers will make more money,
be better satis-fled, and not be congregated
in such lar.ce bodit-s. The owners of the
lands and mills will, in my opinion, make
as much or more money with less capital
tied up and save the major part of the an
noyance they are now subjected to.
7. When the planters lease their lands
and buy the products from the lessees I
think such lessees will have no difficulty
in procuring all the free white Portuguese,
Japanese and Chinese laborers they re
quire.
8. I am in favor of an educational quali
fication. I think every one who can read,
write and speak English 'or Hawaiian
should be permitted to vote. I am most
decidedly against, a property qualification.

TENNIS COURTS
Whitman, the American Cham
pion, at the Net.
Each of the Quartet of Eastern Cracks
to Meet the Best Players
in California.
This has been the banner year for tennis
so far as California is concerned. Tne
best game ever seen on this coast was
played in the championship tournament at
San Rafael on July 4 between George
Whitney and the Hardys. r*o\v comes the
doubles championship, in which both the
Whltneys and the Hardys will appear. To
cap the climax there will be a series of
matches between the best four local rack
et wielders and the best this country has
producedâ the champions of the United
States.
The interest that would otherwise be
taken in the championship doubles has
been somewhat lessened on account of the
arrival of the Eastern champions. The
tirst opportunity to compare the Eastern
with the Western game will be furnished
when George Whitney, the champion of
the Pacilic Coast, crosses rackets with M.
D. Whitman, the champion of the United i
States. Whitman is a young man, slim, ;
tall and muscular, with fast and strong
strokes. His forte is in playing a net
same. Nut having played on anything
but turf courts, he may be at a disad
vantage when hi- meets tin- local men, as |
the asphait is a quickei court than the
turf. Whitman lefl last Tuesdaj for Del
Monte and will have a week's practice to
accustom himself to the courts. George!
Whitney thinks this is quite enough. He |
says that Whitman will be so used to the
Del Monte courts that he will be thor
oughly at home at the beginning of the
tournament.
The doubles championship this year will |
result in the greatest tennis carnival that
has ever been thought of on this coast.
There will be all kinds of matches in sin
glea and doubles. Dwight Davis and Hol
comb Ward, the doubles champions of the
country, will test the Whitney and Ilar.lv
brothers in that game. Many tennis men
wh i are Interested in the outcome of these
matches will go to Del Monte Cor the
three days during the tournament. The;
entries to the championship doubles will
nol be large, but the quality will be of the j
best. At the thr<-.- big clubsâ California,
Oakland and Alameda â the men are prac
ticing daily. The Whitneys are working
hard and are playing their usual good
game of doubles. The same applies to the
Hardys, who practice on tiie other side of
the bay.
This is the schedule of matches for Del
Monte. The play will begin Tuesday next
and end Saturday:
September 5, morningâ Whitman vs. R. X.
Whitney; Ward vs. Sam Hardy; I>avis vs.
c Whitney; Wright vs. Bumner Hardy.

The Eastern teams will enter the tour

the Easterners will meet in the tourna

PISTOL MATCH IN PROSPECT
For several days past there has been
a rumor to the effect that two of the
well-known revolver and pistol shots of
this city may meet in a match. J. E.
Gorman has become expert in the use of
these firearms and his scores have ex
cited comment here and in the East.
Smith Carr, a member of the local police
force, has long been recognized as one of
the best marksmen in the same line that
the Pacific Coast can produce. He has
not been doing much shooting in public
of late, but his friends are of the opinion
that Re is still able to hold his own. How
serious the principals In question regard
the matter of a meeting is not generally
known, but their friends are looking for
a match between them soon.
The forty-first annual prize shoot of the
San Francisco Schuetzen Verein will be
held at Shell Mound range to-morrow.
The prizes are numerous and liberal. The
distribution takes place next Wednesday
evening at California Hall, 620 Bush
street. Among those who will be present
is one man who ha.s been absent from the
range for a lung timeâ Herman Huberâ
who went to Manila with the California
Volunteers. He is a member of the verein
and will without doubt be the hero of the
occasion. There wil! also be several other
guests, as the marines and sailors of the
German warship Geier have promised to
be present.

Dickinson, W. Reeves. E. J. Loughman
L. Schroeder, F. M. Gunn, A. Willis, J.
Brown, E. W. Watts, O. J. Thomas, W. H.
Howard and A. B. Lubbock.
H. C. Cassidy, who was formerly a well
known member of the Pacific Club, but
has resided for some time past at
Keswick, Shasta County, where he has
been in the employ of the Mountain Cop
per Company, and vice captain of the
cricket club, has returned to San Fran
cisco.
The Pacifies held a meeting on Thursday
night, at which it was decided to invite
the Santa Cruz Country Club to play a
return match at Alameda on September
lv. The visiting team will be the guests
of the Pacifies from Saturday to Monday
and will be put up at the Occidental
Hotel. When the Pacific team visited San
ta Cruz and played against the Country
Club, on August 13. they were most hos
pitably entertained. On that occasion the
visitors won easily, and on their own
ground are likely to repeat the victory.
The match against the Santa Cruz visit-'
crs will necessitate the postponement of
the match A to L, versus M to Z. set down
on the schedule for that date. This, how
ever, is of little importance, and can be
played, if desired, on one of the open dates
in October.

FIRST DEER KILLED
ON OLYMPIC PRESERVE
Robert Delafield Gains the Honor, Se
curing a Forked Horn â Gun
men at the Traps.
Robert Delafield of the Olympic Gun
Club has broken the spell of ill luck which
has hovered over the members in their
quest for deer. He killed a forked horn
on the Rodgers ranch during the week,
the first secured on the club's preserve
this season. His success has stirred other
members to action. H. E. Rose, Dr. Feh
leisen and others will be in the field to
day. A number of deer have been seen,
but always out of range.
The "varmint" hunt of the Olympic
Gun Club will be held at its Cordelia

preserves are to be "baited" at once with
wheat to attract the ducks. A clubhouse
for the keeper and members is being fit

Wild geese are making their appearance
in numbers in Tuba and Sutter counties,
thus giving promise of good shooting
when the season opens.

County.
PETTY OPPOSITION TO
AN OLYMPIC NOMINEE
Objection to J. J. Hassell, Whom thÂ«
New Directors Desire Particularly
to Co-operate With Them.
What is pronounced unreasonable an#
shortsighted opposition has developed
against one man on the ticket presented
by the regular nominating committee of
the Olympic Club for the forthcoming
election. The opposition, which has devel
oped at the eleventh hour, is directed solel
ly against J. J. Hassell, the candidate for
secretary. The reason given is that he
has but recently joined the club.
Mr. Hassell is secretary of the Califor
nia Winemakers' Corporation, and was
treasurer of the Midwinter Fair He has
made a reputation as a brilliant finan
cier. It was to avail of his attainments
in this respect that, after much persua
sion, he was prevailed upon to accept thÂ«
secretaryship, a purely honorary position
with many responsibilities. He was im'
portuned to accept the nomination by Mr
Ha i r â¢ on ir M S- Ru s> Mr - Hammersmith
and Mr. Hardee, all men who will be held
responsible for the administration of af
fairs in the club for the next year
When' the subject of opposition wa<*
hinted at Mr. Hassell wanted to withdraw
at once. He was finally prevailed upon to
allow his name to stand. His friends and
the remainder of the new directorate will
make a personal canvass of the member*
on Monday, asking their suffrage. C 1"SIR THOMAS
LIPTON ARRIVES
AT NEW YORK
The Cup Challenger
Greeted atthe Pier.
GIVEN SPLENDID WELCOME
FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE
WILL WIN.
Declares Significantly That the Bet
ter Boat Always Wins and Has
No Fear of an Obstructed
Course.
I m Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton arrived on the Campania to-day. In
his party are William Fife Jr., designer
of the Shamrock; T. W. Ratsey, the fa
mous sailmaker; A; C. Connell, John
Wesrwood and William Duncan.
Sir Thomas said that he had invited and
expected the following gentlemen 10 be
hi!- gatsts during the international races:
Lord --â â II of Killoween. Hon. Charles
Russell, his son. Lord Charles Berosford
and Arnold Mnrley.
NEW YORK, Sept. .â The Cunard
line steamer Campania arrived at Quar
antine to r nlght at 7:30 o'clock and was
me: in the Narrows by a flotilla of tugs
and the steam yacht Erin to greet Sir
Thorn is Li pro n. who was a passenger on
the liner. The Quarantine Commissioners'
boat, the State of New York, also ip
i â¢ area upon the scene with a large party
under the guidance o r Commissioner
i Umt-r. The party consisted of Colonel
Treadweli; Governor Roosevelt's military
secretary, who was sent by the Governor
to receive Sir Thomas Upton; a number
<.: ofticiais and members of the New York
"iacht Club, a number of members from
the New England Society and other simi
lar organisations. All boarded the
steamer and came up to the dock.
Sir Thomas, in his welcome down the
bay. received an invitation extending the
courtesies of htty-Ux clubs while in this
country and an invitation to lead the ma
rine division of the Dewey day celebra
tion with his yacht Erin. Both were ac
cepted.
xhere was a large crowd at the Cunard
oock. when the Campania arnvea. As the
Dig vessel loomed li< it tug oeuring the.
D.g biiamrocti rtsg came aneaa ana this
Caused great cheering on tne part of the
crowd on tne doeK. Cheers were given
lor tne shamrock and h<-r owner.
When Sir Thomas came over tne gang
plank he was received with anomer great
Cheer. He took oit his cap ana bowed,
ana there was a smile on h;s face. He was
pushed and jostled aoout in the great
inrong line a COuntiymun in line tor a
tiexf-t at a circus, out tie [i ok it all in
good nature.
'Upon my word. I did not expect this."
he t-aid, "as Messrs. Fife and Katsey and
a couple of members of the New York
Yacht Club, aided by several policemen,
made a way, for him through the crowd.
"Is this the way they welcome the man
wno comes to get the cup?"
g^t a run lor your money,"
shouted a voice.
"I don't doubt it," answered Sir Thomas
laughingly. "You've always done that."
No cup challenger was ever before
given a reception that would compare
With that accorded- to Sir Thomas.
Ihe party i-ioceeded to the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.
Sir Thomas was anxious, to be informed
how the betting stood o:\ the race. He
was told that it is n<iw I'Xi to 75 in favor
of the Columbia. He appeared to be sur
prised and said -that mere. was a large
I amount of "English money that had ripen
1 brought over r-.ere. and that all they
couia get was even money, and this the
Lnglisnmen had been forced to accept.
'Have you much money on the race?"
he was asked
"I hayÂ« never wagered in my life,'' he
replied.
When asked about the truth of the re
port that the yacht race had cost him
Â£fcO,ooo, he said:
"1 do not know how much the race has
or will cost me. I do not care. Cost
aots not enter into my calculations. I
am here to race for sport only. It Is a
t task to come over after "the Amer
ica's cup. and i hope to be equal to it. '
"I believe that I have the best boat ever
built in England. She cost more than -the
Valkyrie. If in coming to America tor the
cup one halts at the price one had better
srtay at home.
"1 fully appreciate thÂ» talent and skill
that are against us." he continued. "The
Americans will do all in their p^jewr to
keep the trophy and we must do our best.
if we fail no blame will rest upon us. I
have thrown up every business care, left
every difficulty behind and have deter
mined to devote myself to the Shamrock
only. While I am neither a designer nor a
skipper, i will be aboard of her when
every race is sailed.
"The best boat always wins in these in
ternational races," he added. "Even if
the nearest excursion steamer had been
rifty miles the result would have been
I ihe same. Let everybody me to the
race and have a good time. The more
boats there re the merrier. I will fight
for the cup just as hard as 1 can, but
the good wishes of Americans are dearer
*â¢â¢ me than any cup In existence. The
New York Yacht Club cabled me offering
to change the course, but I replied that
1 would not race except on the fame track
as was used before where others won and
lost."
Sir Thomas said that when the Cam
pania left England Columbia sentiment
seemed to prevail, but fie thought all that
had changed and that at the time of ar
rival a majority Of the passengers favored
the Shamrock. Sir Thomas was one of
the last to leave the ship, but a majority
of his fellow passengers were wait] for
him at the gangway, and when he came
out upon the pier they made a lane for
him and greeted him with continuous
cheers as he passed on his way to a car
riage which took him to his hotel.
Mr. Ratsey said that six sailmakers
were due to arrive on the St. Paul with a
quantity of gear for thÂ«? Shamrock. He
added that crosscut racing sails, also
much in vogue in the T.'nlted States, have
b^on tried in England, and sailmakers
there have me to the conclusion that
rht-re 19^ no real advantage to ii* gained
from their use. He good-naturedly ad
mitted, when questioned, that some Amer
ican estimates of the Shamrock's *a!l
area were close to tho fact, and being
closely pressed said it was not much dif
ferent from that of the last Valkyrie.
Races between the Columbia and Dp
fender begin to-morrow. Hundreds of
yachting enthusiasts will form excursion
âºRoats, big and little, and swell the gath
ering that will howl for the winner. That
this will be the Columbia no one doubts,
but the Defender's colors will not be
easliy lowered.
It Is a notable fa â¢ that almost every
Newport yachtsman has of lato rÂ»-come
Intensely and aggressively an admirer of
Columbia. Every day of late Columbia
and Defender have had friendly spins.
Defender folks have not been idle and
she is better by minutes over the thirty
mile courses than she ever was. So the
racers will bp in shapp and their per
formance, with anything like n true pail-
Ing breeze, roust be almost as full of in
terest as the International struggle.
Should Sir Thomas Upton come to
Newport with his steam yacht Erin the
first of the week to note the speed of
Columbia under racing conditions, he will
be royally welcomed. Th* coarse to
morrow will fifteen miles to windward
or leeward â .â  â ', return or triangular ten
miles to a leg. starting off Brentons reef
lightship at 11 o'clock. Captain "Nat"
Herreshoff and his brother Francis will
be among those on Columbia.
It is Mid that both Columbia and De
fender will go to westward after these
races. â¢ . â

manifested has been imparted to their
neighbors and associates In the chief
fields of industrial activity, hence there
need be no surprise if the fair b!
assemble the largest throng of Cal!
fornians ever assembled in Sacramento.
Special effort has be^n directed toward
the enlistment of support from leading
-raisers, whose superb herds of
thoroughbred horses and cattle have
made the State famous. Interests
apart from agriculture and stoekrais

Thp president, directors and other of

show? that success has attended their

attesi . atfibutions of money and

ramento have a way of secluding
themselves from strangers and visitors
while the Legislature is in session, and
for which no one is apt to blame them;
yet the seclusion creates the impres
sion that the city Sacks the attractive
. and refining Influences of art. as ex
pressed in music and the asseihbll
hrlaht men and women. The citizen of
unento knows quite well that his
city is thn capital ol the State In a
larger *ense than being the seat of
government. He knows that music,
painting and literature engage th"
study of men and women of the place;
he knows that Sacramento is not lag

Oakland, but he never pauses to in
quire whether other residents of the
Stave are familiar with this fact There
are many indications at this tim" that
the people of the Capital City hay. r-

and welcome the fair visitors with mu
sic flowers and radiant displays of
light. UJuminations will lend a new
charm to the pavilion. A threefold In

for artistic decoration on a scale that
will involve an outlay of three thou
sand dollars. The leading: mercantile
spirits of the city are rivals in an effort
to surpass all former records of beauty
and style in the exposition of their
fabrics.
The Sacramento Chamber of Com
mprce's standing committee on exhi
bition. T. K. Enwright chairman, rep
resenting the business men. resolved to
interest the citizens generally in the
State Fair, particularly in the matter
of improving the exhibits at the pa
vilion and increasing the attendance,
hence it was decided to organize the
Citizens' State Fair Club.
A general committee of sixty was
created from the leading business men
and an executive committee of seven
was elected, which, with the various
sub-committees, entered upon their
work about the middle of July. The
directors of the Agricultural Society
formally accepted the proffered assist
ance of the Citizens' State Fair Club
and Secretary Peter J. Shields has
been in touch with the committees at
all times.
Some of the results of the organized
effort may be thus enumerated. The
committee on .exhibits. Colonel H. I.
Seymour, reported ail the space in the
pavilion taken three week.- before the
time appointed for the opening of the
fair. The commi tee on special fea
tures. C. W. Morton Chairman, pre
sented many designs excelling in beau
ty and grace anything ever seen in the
pavilion. The committtee on entertain
ment. H. C. Fisher chairman, procured
the services of much profess) tal
ent as well as the services of local
organizations, such as the athletic
clubs, C-lcdonian?. Odd Fellows and
Native Sons and Daughters.
The committee on reception, W. F.
Purnell chairman, organized new fea
tures of a social character. The several
local societies and clubs of women will
hold receptions in rooms specially fitted
for their use. The Wives and daughters
of the directors of th ; Ag-icultural So
ciety will inaugurate these features
and send out cards "At Home" Tues
day evening. September b. to the offi
cers of the thirty-three societies and
clubs of women.
The opening night, Monday. Septem
ber 4. has been designated as "Ladies'
night." The various.organizations, so
cieties and -lv s of women have signi
fied their desire to contribute their
presence, and a .'riendly rivalry has
been developed between . se clubs to
see which one will register the highest
percentage of attendance. The chair
man of the committee on printing, Al
fred Elkus; the chairman of the com
mitteee on publicity, F. L.. Gray, and
the secretary of the executive commit
tee, C. H. Holmes, have rendered val
uable services to the cause.

from the Coney Island Sporting Club.
O'Rourke's offer was 65 per cent of the
gross receipts. : The Coney Island organi
zation bid two-thirds of the gross receipts

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â The sale of thq
entire racing stables of the firm of C.
Fleischmann & Sons and those of George
iE. Smith, better known in the racing
worjd as Pittsburg Phil, took place to
| day in the Easton sale paddocks at
Sheepshead. The fact that the Fleisch
manns were selling out did not mean that
i they were retiring from racing, as this
was not so. Their object is to rid the
1 stable of the old divisions and begin
afresh with a stock of two-year-olds next
i season. Pittsburg Phil has tired of rac
; ing horses, and tnis is his reason for re
'â¢â  tiring. Only four were in his lot, but
they included the two-year-old colt
Roosevelt and the three-year-old Lo
thario. The former cost him $7600 and
Lothario Jlu.uOo at the sale of the Rogers
I & Rose lot at Morris Park last spring.
j The horsemen were out in large numbers,
i and from the very start the bidding was
I spirited. MarfbeiX, who beat the Bromley
j crack Mesmerist in the second part of the
! Grand Union Hotel stakes at Saratoga,
i was the pick of the sale.
The best prices were as follows:

The Hay Market.
The circular of Scott & Macner says of Hay:
"Arrivals of Hay have continued to be act
ive. The total tonnage received for the week
has amounted to 2SSI tons. There has been
co much Hay and other merchandise coming
on the railroad lately that the tracks have
become so thoroughly blockaded that much of
the Hay is delayed for two or three days to
obtain trackage room here in the city for sell-
Ing and unloading. These conditions have in
terfered considerably with making prompt re
turns, and such circumstances will probably
prevail for some little time and until the rush
of Hay is over. Consignments of Hay are
moving oft' fairly, but the consumers are Blow
making purchases, even under the present
thoroughly low ranse of prices.
â¢Arrivals of compressed Hay have been com
paratively heavier than for many months and
the market on such offerings has been weak.
"Alfalfa Hay continues to arrive in large
quantities, and while the range of prices' can
not be quoted as lower, yet the feeling la
weak. The dairymen are beginning to lay In
their winter supply, but it is difficult to place
consignments satisfactorily with them, as their
Ideas are lower than the present rates."
Dried Fruit in New York.
X-w York say
"Without material change In yesterday's
markets, there was, perhaps, slightly more in
terest shown in some lines, and different mem
l.^rs of thu trade were considering the prob
ability of the reduction in the f. o. b. prices
of Prunes that was reported. Actual sales of
any variety were small so far as known, but
there is certainly more inquiry, and the per-
Fistency with which rumors of large sales
come to the surface Indicates that there are
large negotiations in progress.
"There have been reports current the past
two days to the effect that the price Of Prunes
had been reduced to 2 s ic for outside goods.
Early in the week it was pointed out in this
column that such a move was in contempla
tion, but that nothing had been done in the
matter then. It could not he learned with cer
tainty that it had been done yet. but appar
ently something has been done looking toward
that object, because it seems to be generally
understood. A number of large buyers are
ready to take big orders at the reduction,
hence sales promise to be large in the near
future. Inquiry Is said to be disappointing,
notwithstanding the short crop in Oregon and
Washington and the probable small output
abroad.
"Peaches are unchanged, but the tendency
at resent Is in buyers' favor. The output is
going to 1.-- bo much larger than was original
ly mated that prices are weaker, and a
firm offer for a round lot might secure less
than inside quotations.
"Apricots are steady, though the tendency
i)f prices is upward."

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â The feature of to-day's
market was the. vigorous offer to the bulls
about midday to lift the market out of its
listless and heavy condition by a sharp advance
in the Vanderbllts. The efforts miscarried and
Invited such a flood of realizing that prices
cold off to the lowest point to-day, which was
In many cases as much as $1 per share below !
last night's level. The bears had a hand In
the decline, but the demand from shorts to
cover was light and rallies in the general list
â were of small proportions. The movement of
railroads generally throughout the morning
were exceedingly small either way. except In
a few individual cases. Chicago and Eastern
Illinois was pushed up over two points above
par, but relapsed nearly three points. The
movement Of the specialties In the first hour
was a good deal mixed, Consolidated Gas and
Tennessee Coal shooting up two point*, but
the Tobacco stocks, Brooklyn Transit and Sugar
â were heavy in tone. Only a little before noon,
Omaha and Northwestern were > pushed upon a
revival of the old story of the absorption of
the former by the latter. About the same time
of the appearance the New York Central an
nual report showed in detail the rather strik
ing economies effected by the consolidation of
that great system. The result was a rise of
eight points in Omaha, 3?i in Northwestern and
nearly two points In New York Central. A
number of other Vanderbllts sympathized to
the extent of a point, and the Union Pacific
stocks were bid up a point, giving force to
the rumor that the much talked-of transcon
tinental consolidation was about to be perfect
ed. The very heavy blocks of Union Pacific
stocks coming out' on the rise and the detec
tion by the bears of selling for leading account,
brought a determined raid and a realizing
movement along the line. The gains, which
had been extended In some cases to nearly a
point, were quickly wiped out, and the gen
eral level of the market fell below last night,
Brooklyn Transit dropping two points. Cen
tral Pacific lost IV The market was very
listless during the last hour and closed gen
erally easy at 105 decline. London sent higher |
prices and bought here to a moderate extent, J
but this support was without avail to sustain i
the market. The fear of an unfavorable bank
statement was a heavy weight on the mar
ket. The New York clearing bouse banks have '
lost heavily during the week, both through the |
interior movements and to the sub-Treasury, j
Shipments on balance to the interior to the j
extent of nearly $2,000,000 can be traced. The ]
statements of J}je sub-Treasury during the week
show that institution to have absorbed on ac- j
count of internal and revenue customs pay
ments and deposits for shipment to the interior,
something like $3,800,000, alter allowing for pay- i
ment of $700,000 on account of drafts from the j
San Francisco Mint. Some allowance is to be
made for receipts in gold, at assay offices which
are credited to the banks, and there is an
apparent loss of cash of nearly $5,000,000. There
Is no evidence of any sufficient reduction of
deposit liabilities by contraction of loans to
offset this fall In cash resources.
There was not much done in the bond mar
ket to-day, but prices were firmly held. Total
sales, par value. $1,680,000.
United States Government bonds unchanged
in bid quotations.

Brad street's Financial Review.
â¦ Â» â 
NE"W York, Sept. Lâ Bradstreet's Financial i
i to-morrow will say: It has ben a
rather dull speculative week, the market Ix'ing ,
almost entirely in the hands of professional In
terests. In its earlier' days the tone was heavy !
and m I I cessions were recorded, owing
to the rather unfavorable aspect of the Trans
vaal dispute. London's nervousness on that
uas reflected In the New York market,
although this feeling took the form of an in
tlon to Btart any large movement rather |
than of active bearishness In the market at
| large. In the last days the hardening of money
â¢nt to the September disbursements
has been a factor and would account In a
measure for the relatively small amount of.
trading and the disposition of certain stocKs,
which have lately been the objects of bullish
\ manipulation, to recede slightly. Lotnl.,n,
after its recovery (rum the fear about rupture i
In 6 uth Africa, contributed toward the steady
ing of prices in our market. ItÂ« purchases, |
however, were not upon a large scale and were i
; confined mainly t" a few low-priced stocks. '
Although large interests in the Wall street â 
markets were not active^, there was neverthe
t< evidence of support in various parts of the !
list whenever the room traders attempted to
.-â¢â¢I! .~twks down. At the same time manifesta
tiona of bullish activity aftd sentiment were
mainly confined to the low-priced stocks and
' railroad specialties, some of the representa
tive of that class which le.l the recent move
ment in their division of the list falling back
, a little, while other properties of the same
â  kind came into more or less prominence. None '
Of the fluctuations of the week in the standard
Stocks were of an important character, and It !
was mainly in the industrials and specialties
I like (ViiMjllriated Gas that any considerable
' swings were seen, although on Friday the Van-
I ilerbllt properties showed strength and activity
baaed on the annual report of the New York
Central road. The fact that the crops are
safe and that railroad earnings continue to In- !
crease tend to support prices and to diminish :
tli>- Influence of the prevalent feeling: that
prices for many of the dividend-paying securi- ]
ties have fully discounted present prospects.
One Of the noticeable features of the week has
lief-n the strength of the steel and iron group i
of securities, some representatives of that
: ! class creeping up without apparent effort or
any considerable activity.
: ; Several Important developments affecting rail
: nad properties were announced. A plan for
! the reorganization of the Kansas City, Pitts
r \ burs and Gulf road was brought by the New ,
! York reorganization committee. This, how- i
, j ever, seems to involve the probability of a con- j
: fllct with the rival Philadelphia committee and
, It must be admitted that 'he securities of the ;
i company in question have little interest for
Wall street. A much more important Incident, '
] though it was hardly reflected by the market, I
p ! was the declaration of a 2 per cent semi-an
nual dividend upon Onion Pacific preferred,
i thus placing that stock on a 4 per cent bfislp.
i Accompanying thie was the announcement that
i the company Is to Increase its preferred stock
! : by $2".. 000.000. making the total of that class of !
i shares $1110.000,000. The increase, together with
a further Issue of $7,609,000 of common stock, is
to be used to retire the remaining shares IP f
< ire^-on Railway and Navigation Company and
, the junior bonds of the Oregon Short Line
' This plan will give the Tnlon Pacific complete
, ! control of its lines from Omaha to Portland
( >r . and hap led to a revival of the old story I
that a consolidation of the Union Pacific with 'â¢
â¢ ; the Chicago and Northwestern and possibly a
i lease of both properties to the New York Cen- !
i j tral is In progress. _,
Bi adstrect 's on Trade.
NEW YORK, Sept. I.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: With an exceptionally heavy
business already booked for the latter portion
of the year the mercantile community faces the
trade situation with testified to by
very generally firm prices and with quotations
in a number of lines showing; further marked
advances. The most conspicuous exception jto
this Is found in cereals, which are weak and
declining. Lower prices for wheat, corn and
oats point to simulative liquidation of tired
holders, who, with confidence in the future of
prices, have weakened under unsatisfactory
foreign demand, large racsipts and the near
approach of expected . heavy crop movement.
Corn crop prospects, though loss rosy, still
point to a full yield. Cotton, too, has weakened
slightly, chiefly because advices of rain at the
South, though Texas crop advices are still un
satisfactory and stories of permanent demand
are forthcoming. With these exceptions most
staples are either firmly held or evince decided
progress upward, notÃbly In this latter respect
being iron and steel of all kinds, but particu
larly, piglron, which Is now the center of trade
Interest owing: to heavy demand, particularly
lor foundry grades, at a^vanceing prices. Trade
I reports would seem to Indicate that a good part
of "the productive capacity of the country is
! already engaged for the first half of 1900.
Sympathetic- strength is evinced by other
classes of material, among the materials ad
vancing this week being bar lrtm at nearly all
markets, steel billots, rolled iron and steel, tin
plates and nails.
From the manufactured textile trade excep
tionally good reports come. August witnessed
a reneral gain In the prices of cotton and
| â woolen goods evidently the outcome of an ac
! tive demand ' Judging from reports from lead-
Ing cities. â¢:r \, w' v â 
Scarcity of material and backward deliveries
of same are reported by clothing manufactur
l ers at many points North. West and South.
Among other textiles strength is especially
I notable In hemp and sympathy with Ix>ndon.
whence come reports that Philippine shipments
' will shortly cease Increased strength has been
j imparted to hides and leather this week by the
: launching, of the new upper leather combina
tion. Boot and shoe manufacturers are actu
ally employed, hut the margin of profit is re
ported to be exceedingly small owing to keen
competition. , Â . ,
Lumber retains all of its old activity, and in
some lines manifests new strength as regards
prices. The refined sugar war apparently still
continues, one result belnsr the stimulation or
consumption to a notable extent. A good
business is doing In tobacco at most markets,
special activity being reported from manufac
turing centers in Florida, whence it is re
ported that the Cuban crop will be a very large
one.
In industrial lines the situation is reported
very satisfactory. Employment is general and
strikes and labor troubles generally are con
spicuous by their absence.
Business failures tor the week are the small
est reported for a long time, numbering only
131, as compared with 154 last week. 1Â«4 In this

Dun's Reviezv of Trade.
NEW YORK, Pept. I.â R. O. Dun * Co.'*
weekly review of trade will p.'iy to-morrow:
The astonishing feature is the magnitude of
demand, notwithstanding prices which would
ordinarily check it. In products dW^ctly con
sumed by Individuals the larger employment
and better wages of the working force give
explanation. Efforts to meet the demand call
for mire stores, manufacturing works and ma
chinery and facilities for transportation, as If
every man's wages were in part diverted to
build up the nation's machinery of manufactur
ing and distribution. The occasion promises
quick profits, the building Is largely for the
future, and It goes on In spite of unusual
prices.
The demand exceeds the supply of Pessemer
pig, again raiFing the price for that and an
thracite to $22 50, Southern foundry to - { >- 20
at Pittsburg. with heavy sales; gray forge to
$19 and Southern at Chicago to $80 66, with
local coke nt $21. Structural shapes were ad
vanced $5 i*>r ton a week ago, cut nails 25
cents per k>-g this week, plates $2 per ton.
common bar iron to M *-7 ; : at Pittsburg and
tool steel to 7 cents, with larK Mexican orders
placed for pipe and good orders for bridges at
Chicago. Few works can promise delivery be
fore December, and most "f the heavy con
tracts placed have be--n for next year's de
livery.
Recent advances in boots and shoes and
leather do not prevent large business, and
hides have slightly risen at Chicago. Ship
ments of boots and Fhoes from Boston, 5.7
per cent larger than In any other year to date,
were 14.1 pnr cent larger In August than in
any other year, and 24 pÂ»r cent larger than In
IVi2. Buyers press for early delivery. Manu
facturers refuse many orders and some hiivp
already contracts for further ahead than they
wish. leather ia a little stronger with a
heavy business.
Sales of wool have been moderate, fi. 325.700
pounds for the week and for five weeks, 42,0n:>.
--?90, of which 86,468,390 were domestic, and when
the lost great speculation was in progress s.-iles
in the same weeks of 1895 were 67.669,292 pounds,
of which 30.115.1i57 were domestic. Some hesi
tancy in buying by manufacturers is attrib
uted to current prices and In quarter-hlood
washed fleece and unwashed and combing light,
some concessions have been made, so that
the average of lf>o ((notations by Coates Bros.
is about 20.33 cents, ag;iin~i 20.40 cents August
1. Mills have strong demands for goods, and
the clay worsted have further advanced. In
cotton goods demand exceeds supply and many
kinds have advanced, although the material
has declined.
Wheat has declined, mainly because reports
of Injury in the Northwest have been dis
credited and the exports from both coasts have
been " for the week 3,010,010 bushels, against
3,785,759 last year, and for five weeks 16,114,685
bushels, against 16,875,839 last year. The West
ern receipts have been 19,551.474 bushels,
against 20,820,585 last year, indicating in re
cent weeks some disposition on the part of
the farmers to hold their grain.
The enormous exports of corn, 20.502.129 bush
el?., against 10,999.495 In the same weeks last
year, and the Western receipts, 19.722,109 bush
els, against 19,620,787 last year, are not to be
forgotten and have caused a decline of 1 cent
in prices.
Failures for the week have been 141 In the
United States, against 171 last year, and 25
In Canada, against 22 last year.

Chicago Wheat Market.
CHICAGO, Sept I.â Wheat suffered from lack â .
of interest and closed %c lower for December,
but unchanged for September. The must prom
inent feature ot the day's session in wheat
was the extreme dullness of trading, and to
this more than anything contained in the news
was the slight decline which closed the lead
ing speculative option. The market was a
shade lower at the start In both September
and December, the result of lower quotations
fr,om Liverpool. There was, however, little
selling of consequence. Deliveries on Septem- j
ber contracts were heavy. Armour putting out i
about 750,000 bushels, though this had appar
ently been discounted by traders, for if had i
little effect, and buying orders for September
were In the hands of several commission houses.
December opened a shade lower at 69%@69%c.
The market held at about those prices lor some
time, but with little trading eluÂ»er way. A
short period of comparative strength followed,
the market, reversing the usual order of things,
following the lead of course grains, which
showed considerable strength. But about noon .
the lack of interest had turned prices down- j
ward. It was mostly a scalpers" market af
ter that time and based chiefly on puts and
call. The bears did little until longs got load
ed up, but after that they put pressure on the
market at Intervals and succeeded in shaking
out long wneat In some quantities and caused
a slow decline in prices. There was not much
export inquiry and the local cash business was
slow. September advanced To' c, declined to
69% c, and closed unchanged at 69 5 ,*c. December
declined to 71% c and closed He lower at 71%
@71% c.
â  Corn was firm and slightly higher all day.
December closed %c higher.
Oats were higher all around In sympathy with '
corn. December closing VÂ»@l4c higher and i

Provisions were decidedly active and weak.

out of yellow fever at Key West caused liquida
tion from all quarters and flattened out prices j
of pork and ribs. Lard did not suffer so much.
Lower pork prices contributed to the weakness. I
PacKers were moderate sellers. At the close
October pork was 22%e lower, lard 5c lower ana
ribs 10{il2 l lower.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
What the Butter market needs more than
anything else is the formation of an exchange
where prices can be established. At present
dealers are quoting all sorts of prices, accord
ing to the state of their floors. One says that
25c is the top for creamery, and another shows !
sales at 80031 c. Still another quotes 2Sc and a
fourth 27c. This is a foolish state of affairs,
and is peculiar to San Francisco, for every
other important city in the United States has
an exchange and thus avoids this inexcusable
confusion. It is not doing business on modern
principles, but is the way of our grandfathers.
Butter is weak. Eggs and Cheese are very

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
! there have been seven arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 17.391 tons; four from British
Columbia. 13,164: one from Baltimore. 3500;
I total, 34,055 tons. This is fully equal to thÂ«
amount consumed. If we can keep up sU'.h
i deliveries there will be no cause for complaint,
â  but this is very dubious, as the increased de
i mand for fuel for the United States transports
! for several months to come means a very ma
terial shrinkage to our stocks in yard. The
winter months will be with us shortly, whi'h
signifies a doubling up of the monthly con
sumption of fuel for domestic uses, and th-Â»
reserve stock which should be on hand to meet
our fall requirements is not here. There are
several steamers en route, which will be called
Into requisition as coast coal transports, due
here in sixty to ninety days. With the aid
of these we shall probably tide over our diffi
culties, although it is sailing too close to the
wind for comfort.
"Freights on foreign coals are moving up
ward from all sections and carriers are scarce
at the advance. There seems to be a spon
taneous demand for steamers and sailers every
where. The result is the value of all ship
property has advanced 25 to 35 per cent this
year. It is time that shipowners should have
their innings; they have had hard lines for the
past two years."

IN THE SUPREME COURT
Horace W, Philbrook's Grave
Charges Against Reputa
ble Men.
His Old Disbarment Proceeding Induces
Him to Attack the JusticesâChief
beatty Confronts the Accuser in a
Very Personal Manner,
HORACE W. PHI IOK, who a 1
) 1 few years ago was disbarred 'â 
from practicing as an attorney ';
in the State courts, has broken
ll again. Since his disbarment
he has made many applications to be re- |
stored to the position he formerly held, but ,
each time without success. His last appeal I
to this end is almost certain to stir up an .
endless amount of strife and possibly re- j
suit in bloodshed. He has prepared what
he calls "a brief," but. like most lawyers'
briefs, it Is lengthy, consisting of nearly
five hundred pages. Within the covers
of this he has attacked everybody con
nected viith the Supreme Court, the South
ern Pacific Railroad and a number of .
reputable lawyers.
In getting this before the Supreme |
Court Mr. Philbrook has already put the j
gloves on with Chief Justice Beatty. The j
<'hief Justice has for reasons best known I
to himself refused to meet Mr. Philbrook I
alone ar.d any meeting necessary has al- i
ways been In the .presence of witnesses, i
Last January 1 nil brook made application
for reinstatement and for permission to
resume the practice of law, but his re
quest was refused by the court on the
ground that the petition itself was threat- !
ening and Insulting. Philbrook endeav
ored to have his petition filed for record i
in the court and succeeded. There the !
matter has rtsted ever since, Philbrook
stating that he wished to prepare his .
brief and argument in support i if his mo
tion. Several times he has endeavored
to obtain an audience with the Justices,
but without material result, excepting the !
<*hief Justice, who, by reason of his po- j
sition, is obliged to listen to any and all i
having business with the court.
A lew days ago Philbrook called upon j
the Chief Justice, who granted him an !
audience, not in his chambers but in an j
outside room occupied by Bailiffs A. W.
Poole and E. E. Washburn, whom the
Justice took care should remain as wit- i
nesses. Philbrook retained his seat, with j
his hat on, and brusquely addressed his
Honor in this language:
"Is this the room in which you receive
your visitors who have business to trans- I
act with you?" To this Justice Beatty i
replied; angrily:
"This is where I receive you. if at all," i
with an emphasis on the "you."
Philbl accepted without further pro- j
test what he subsequently stated was an j
insult and made known his business. He
said that the regular motion day will be
: â¢xl Tuesday and requested the Chief
Justice to have the motion for reinstate
ment placed on the calendar of that day.
Justice Beatty replied that he did not
have the making up of the calendar and
gave n>> attention to those matters. This j
aroused the anger of Philbrook, who ex- >
cttedly exclaimed: ;
"I will hold you personally responsible ;
for the outrage you are perpetrating upon
meâ"
But he had gone only this far when the
Chief Justice paled to the lips with anger, |
shook hie fist under the disbarred attor
ney's nose and excitedly exclaimed:
"Do you mean that personally? All I ,
want you to say is that you mean this as
a personal threat against me. Say it. sir; J
say it if you dare!" Philbrook made no :
direct reply, but Justice Beatty continued '
to storm up and down the room, mutter- !
ing that he was willing and ready to be I
held "personally responsible at any time." !
Philbrook changed the subject by asking !
if Beatty had read his brier, to which he :
received a reply in the negative, the Just- j
ice adding that he would not read it, nor j
would he give a reason.
The brief in question has been placed in j
the hands of each of the seven Justices, j
and no doubt will furnish some Interesting |
re;:dir.g matter for em. In it Philbrook i
attacks them personally and severally and I
charges them with nearly every offense i
except wife-beating and murder. He goes 1

l>ack and minutely sets forth all the de
tails of the Levinson estate case, and as
serts that the widow and daughters were
swindled out of Levinson's share In the
firm of Newman i Levinson through the
manipulations of R. C. Harrison, who
was then the attorney for the Newman
brothers and la now one of the Justices
of the Supreme Court. He also declares
that the Supreme Court itself had pledged
Itself in advance to decide the probate ap
peal against Mrs. Levinson and her
daughters. ,
Another issue that he raises relates to
his proceeding in the United States court
before Judge Morrow for damages <=â¢.:-
tained by him in his disbarment. It will
be remembered that six of the Justices
were represented by Attorney John Gar
ber, but Fustice Harrison was represent
ed by W. W. Foote, who is made the
special object of attack. In his brief
I'hilbrook says:
"One of the ...... who appeared at
this trial was W. W. Foote, who an
nounced that he had been employed spec
ially to represent Justice Ralph C. Harri
son". Here was Justice Ralph C. Harri
son, the traitor who had sold his clients,
Mrs. Fannie Levinson and her daughters,
to their enemies, the two Newmans, em
ploying as his special champion W. W.
Foote, the traitor who sold his clients,
James P. and Frederick A. Merritt, to
their enemy. Judge Stanly. â¢ â¢ â¢
birds of a feather, traitor appearing as
champion of traitor. Now, as is well
known, the forte of W. v. Foote is that
of a bully and a blackguard. Big and
burly, his tactics are to embarrass the
opposing counsel and the opposing wit
nesses with insolence, browbeating and
all manner of blackguardism."
In the past Mr Philbrook has published
a number of "appeals to the people." but
therein he has not referred disrespectful
to Mr. Foote. In his reference to the Mer
ritt case he asserts thai Fo ite took an
unprofessional advantage of Catherine M.
Garcelon, an aged woman who Inherit*
a large portion of the Merritt state In
Oakland. The Merritt boys were her heirs
and the accuser says that Foote sent them
to the country and kf-pt thrm drunk until
he could secure a contract or agreement
by which he could clean up $125 '*" of their
interest. Philbrook pretends to connect
Foote with the alleged "rascality" of the
Supreme Court Justices in a peculiarly
roundabout way. He claims that at the
time Foote was a Railroad Commissioner
he was a minority of one. and sought to
secure public approbation by posing as an
nnti-rallroad Commissioner in the grain
rate cases: that his "howling" against the
railroad did the corporation no harm, and j
its officers, wishing to use Mr. Foote, held j
over him the facts of the Garcelon case.
so that when the time came that one of]
its alleged tools. Justice Harrison, was a
party in the damage suit Foote was used j
to protect Justice Harrison. I
Robert Y. Ha-. who was Instrumental ,
in Philbrook's disbarment; ex-Attorney
General W. F. Fitzgerald ex-Justice (now :
Federal Judge) John J. de Haven, Judge,
R B Carpenter and half a dozen or more
prominent lawyers have also come in for j
a large share of abuse In Philbrook s
brief. He goes so far even as to accuse
the Supreme Court of mutilating the
court records in order to serve the pur- ,
pose of the Southern Pacific In a case in
which It was interested.
That this sensational document will pro
voke hot blood among those attacked goes
without saying. A limited number have ]
been printed in the legal form of a Su- ,
preme. Court brief, and the balance,
amounting to a total of nearly 500. have
been printed in book or magazine form. j
under Philbrook's old title of "An Appeal
to the People." These will no doubt be ,
distributed where Philbrook thinks they j
will do the most good to hi*self and In- ;
iury to those whose names are contained j
therein. When his motion comes up in I
the Supreme Court on Tuesday to be
placed on the calendar this remarkable i
document must form a part of the court
record. It is doubtful if the assertions
which it contains, charging reputable citi- j
zens with all manner of crimes and ras
cality, will go unchallenged.

MILITARY ELK SOCIAL
GIVEN TO SOLDIERS
MANY DISTINGUISHED MEN
WERE PRESENT.
San Francisco Lodge No. 3, Benevolent
Protective Order of Elks, had an "Elks'
military social" last night in its spacious
hall in Central block, which for the occa
sion was decorated with flags and tri-col
ored electrical effects. The occasion was
a greeting to many of the returned volun
teers andva number of military gentlemen,
such as Elks know how to give.
Prominent among those present were:
Rev. Father McKlnnon, the much beloved
chaplain of the First California, who was
greeted by all with a welcome thai must
have been exceedingly nattering to him;
General Shatter and his aids, Major No
ble and Captain Ducat; Governor Rich
ards of Wyoming; Colonel Hutchlngs,
Lieutenant Governor of Idaho; Captain
Harry Cruzon of the First California; Pri
vates Estell, Overshine and Welsh of the
Hospital Corps; Percy V. Long, recently
nominated for second lieutenant of one of
the new regiments, nearly all the mem
bers of Major General Dickinson's staff,
many minor lights in the military world
and many members of the lodge and visit
ing Elks.
For all there was open hospitality, and
there was presented an excellent pro
gramme of vocal and instrumental num
bers under the direction of Colonel J. R.
Ho well, who acted as president of the
evening. In his duties he was assisted by
Colonel Beck. T. F. Bonnet and other of
ficers of the lodge. There were short ad
dresses by Captain Cruzon, who intro
duced Father McKinnon In a eulogistic
speech. The chaplain of the First re
sponded modestly and briefly. The Gov
ernor of Wyoming and the Lieutenant
Governor of Idaho also delivered short
addresses, the former congratulating the
people of California for their grand re
ception to the volunteers, and he added
that the men of his State had been so
favorably impressed with the open-heart
ednesÃ and the generosity of the people
that he was afraid that they would aJI
want to return to California.

DEATH OF M. P. JONES.
Was One of the Pioneer Merchants of
San Francisco.
M. P. Jones, senior member of the firm
of Jones-l'addock Company, died a week
ago last Tuesday. Deceased was active
ly engaged In business in this city for
the last forty years. He came to San
Francisco in uw and shortly after his ar
rival went, to the southern mines, where
lie established a general merchandise
store. In this undertaking he prospered,
and in 1858 returned to San Francisco,
and in connection with Frank Randall
ho organized the firm of Randall & Jones.
Randall rftirlng a few years later, Mr.
Jones continued under the firm name of
Jones & Co. The house was one of the
first as well as the heaviest Importers of
sugar from the Hawaiian Islands, owning
several vessels plying In the island trade
before the steamship lines were estab
lished. About two years ago the firm of
J.'ii'-d & Co. changed the character or"
their business to that of wholesale tea,
i-offec and spice merchants, incorporat
ing under the name of the Jones-Paddock
Company.
In all these years of active business
life Mr. Jones' character as a high-mind
ed, upright, honorable merchant re
mained unspotted. He believed his call-
Ing to be tl.e best of all. and he dignified
it by his manner of life and his dealings
with his fellowmen. He was a true type
of the old-time merchant? of San Fran
ctsco, the men who more than any other
class of citizens in their day did so much
by their influence and personality to
shape the destiny of our city in the early
days of her trials. He was faithful in his
duties ap a private citizen, always ready
to do his part in anything for the good
of San Francisco, but always declining
the offers of political place in the munic
ipality frequently tendered to him by
his fellow citizens.
A* a man of strong character, modest,
gentle, patient and uncomplaining during
years of suffering, those nearest and
dearest to him knew him best. When the
end came, surrounded by these, he passed
peacefully to an honored rest.
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
JURY FINDS YON
KAPFF GUILTY
OF FALSE OATH
Sad Downfall of an
Ex-Constable.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 1
Henry W. yon Kapff, an ex-Constable
of Alameda, was convicted to-day of per
! jury by a Jury in Judge Hall's court un
der an indictment found by the Grand
Jury over a year ago, together with five
i others, which were left as a legacy to
I'isnict Attorney Allen by his predeces
| sor.
The impression prevailed that the cases
would never be . pressed iind that even
should they be brought to trial no con
viction would follow. The verdict there
fore arrived at after the jury had dehb
i crated about forty-live minute 6 proved a
i great surprise. It was the first convic
! tion of its kind for many years.
Yon Kapff was accompanied In court
! by a sister, Miss Violet yon Kapff, and
when the verdict was read the convicted
! young man showed grief but little less
I than his sister, who wept bitterly.
The past two days had been occupied
with the trial, Emil Nusbaumer defend
ing and Deputy District Attorneys Harris
und Samuels prosecuting. The jury was
! made up of J. H. Tuesher, E. C. Perkins.
George T. Leon, C. li. Harmon, Henry
! Schmidt, A. Burnell. Chris Christensen.
â  Ken Wright, N. P. Nutting. Martin Dud
j dy, R. T. Marshall and D. Miller.
The crime of which Yon Kapff now
stands convicted is that of perjury in
1 swearing that he made arrests of V. Bal
dt-ramos on a charge of disturbing the
p.'a'-e and Captain A. M. Panzu on
i charges <>f disturbing the peace and bat
-1 tery in September, 1^57, and presenting
! claims to the county for $1 30 in each cajse
â Jl fur executing warrants and 16 cents
i mileage to and from the County Jail.
The testimony was very clear. Officer
: Theodore Anderson of Alameda testified
I to having effected the Balderamos arrest
i and Officer L'ennis Welch the two arrests
jof Panza. Welch was corroborated by
Mrs. Panza.
Ur at sympathy was expressed on all
sides for young Yon Kapff's sad devia
tion from the path of rectitude. In his
argument to the Jury Deputy District At
torney Samuels declared that stripped of
his official character he, too, extended his
1 deepest sympathy. One of the jurors
, stated after his discharge that he
hud twice cast his ballot for :.c
--; qulttal owing to hi? extreme sym
pathy, but in view of the testi
mony he, too, eventually convicted. '1 lie
jury ie-commended the convicted man to
the mercy of the court. He wa? remand
ed to the custody of the Sheriff and sen
tence wili tie pronounced next Wednesday.
The minimum punishment is one year and
the maximum fourteen y*ars in the State
penitentiary.
Only a few years since Henry' yon
Kapft vas one of the most popular young
men 'n Alameda society. He was the
leader of an Alameda orchestra and re
cently married a most estimable young
lady of the Knclnal city.
"I am the victim of circumstances,"
said the prisoner this afternoon. "I made
one of the arrests on which I am convict
ed myself; the other was made by ray
deputy. I will gay this, however," that
perhaps our eagerness under the fee sys
tem iva= partly responsible. Frequently
the Alameda police would make arrests
withoul warrants. I wuuld Â«et wind of
it and then I was allowed to swear to a
complaint, secure a warrant, serve It and
takt my prisoner to the County Jail. I
most certainly presented claims for such
arrests and for doing this I am con
victed."
The can most likely will be appealed to
the Supreme Court. There are three
other Indictments for perjury pending
against Yon Kapff, but these, it was stat
ed by Deputy District Attorney Samuels,
will most likely be dismissed.
WEPT IN COURT AT
HIS OWN IGNORANCE
OAKLAND. Sept. I.â The most remark
able spectacle of a ful-grown man crying
In court because he had not sufficiently
qualified himself to be admitted to citi
zenship was presented In Judge Ells
worth's department yesterday.
The weeper was Frank Abramson, who
has hitherto been a loyal subject of King
Oscar of Sweden. Abramson Is a seafar
ing man, but was evidently far from ig
ncinnt of the ways of the land lubber, for
he confided to Judge Ellsworth that the
reason he had nut become better acquaint
ed with the governmental affairs of this
great empire was that "politics was so
rotten."
It was pitiable to hear Abramson make
this confidence and then go on to say that
he felt convinced he was very Ignorant
anyhow and thought he had belter not go
ahead any more with ihÂ» examination.
Hut it was far more pitiable to see the big.
husky Swede break out into tears, blub
bering liko a schoolboy. His endeavors
to excuse his weakness only made his pre
dicament the worse, for he sobbed out
loud.
Viewing Abramson with compassion
Judge Ellsworth dismissed the applicant
and denied the application.

MARRIED IN
SECRET OVER
A YEAR AGO
Pretty San Leandro
All Agog.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Sept. 1.
A most romantic secret wedding has
Just come to light In that town of roman
tic happenings, San Leandro, the couple
being Miss Maude Harlan, a daughter of
George Harlan. one of the survivors of
the Dormer Lake expedition, and Robert
Henry, a lieutenant in the Salvation Army,
but more recently a mate on a coast-
Ing vessel.
For over thirteen months the marriage
i has been kept from the town gossips of
San .Leandro, oniy to leak out through
: the groom, who was not as close-mouthed
;as his wife's family wished him to be. In
1 fact, until a few dayp ago Mrs. Henry vig
orously denied the intimations wnich l.er
{ husband had dropped on several occasions,
I but when she saw that the secret was out
I she declared herself and Is now no longer
! playing the role of a single woman.
It was about two years ago that Henry,
\ then an active worker in the Salvation
â  Army cause, was detailed to labor in San
! Leandro. He set to work with a will, and
! being an earnest, forceful and eloquent
i speaker soon had largely attended meet
ings. Among the most regular of the at
; tendants upon these meetings naÂ« Mis?
i Harlan, who had long been prominently
i identified with the charitable work prose
; cuted by the Presbyterian church.
Henrys fervor and worth made an im
' preaaton upon Miss Harlan, so much so
| that their acquaintance soon ripened into
I love. The young man was permitted to
I visit Mist Harlan at her home and an en
-1 gagement naturally followed. Un July
2i of last year they decided to become n.au
' and wifei and s6 traveled over to Ban
Kafael, where they were married by the
Presbyterian minister of that place. Ad
1 the young woman returned to her home
; the same evening her parents' suspicion*
j were not aroused, and for a long time the
! old folks were In ataolute ignoiaiu>e at
I what had transpired.
Eventually, however, the bride's family
' guessed at the young woman's secret and
I she admitted it, but persisted In keeping
; the fact of a marriage from the public in
spite of her husband's protests. Thero
probably was a design in Henry's sugges
tions dropped casually to his friends, lor
the secret Is now out. To-day Henry left
i for the north on a six weeks' voyage.
ACCIDENT DESTROYED
HER MATERNAL HOPES
; OAKLAND, Sept. I.â ln a suit filed in
the Superior Court this afternoon against
1 the Oakland Transit Company Mrs.
: Helena E. Kinsner seeks to recover $50,000
damages for permanent Injuries sustained
! on July 29 last while alighting from an
! electric car running westerly on Eighth
: street at Union.
i The complaint, prepared by Attorneys
; H. S. Aldrich and E. L. Mann, alleges

1 car started forward suddenly and with
'. great spe^d. throwing Mrs. Kinsner to the
ground with great force and violence,
bruising her left leg, thigh, hip and
shoulder, loosening the bones of her left
I foot and giving her nervous system a
' severe shock, incapacitating her from
helping herself In the most ordinary
means and performing any labor either
physical or mental. By reason of said
injuries plaintiff will continue for the rest
of her life to undergo great physical and
, mental suffering and agony.'
' The plaintiff also avers that at the time
i of the accident she was about to become
', a mother, but by reason of the injuries
and on August 27 nature in this particu
lar was defeated.

Was Not Declared Insane. j
â  OAKLAND. Sept. Mrs. Oliver P. Doug
las, aged 87 years and formerly a school
, teacher, was brought from the County 1
'. Infirmary to-day and examined by the
i Lunacy Commissioners, but was not rec
ommended for commitment to an insane
asylum. She was taken to the infirmary!
about a year ago. as she was too feeble
to provide for her own support. Under j
the weight of years her mind has been
gradually growing enfeebled, so that it
! requires constant watching to prevent her
wandering away and injuring herself. She
has a brother, J. E. Gordon, residing In j
this city, and the Lunacy Commissioners ,
recommend that she be cared for by her (
relatives.

robbed of her purse containing $10 last
: night by a stranger, who left her with 25
cents. She gives her age as 17 and later
claimed her name to be Annie Barndown.
At the jail she was regarded as a mys
tery.

THOS COOK & SON, Acts.. 621 Market St.
the encounter had gone about his busi
ness, seating himself later in a cnair In
the kitchen, where he suddenly expired.
Mrs. Holmes, queer as it might be to re
late, was her husband's stepmother oe
fore she married him. and was formerly
the wife of her husband's father, who was
! a Mormon, she being but one of several
| spouse?. In her testimony she was cor
roborated by other grandchildren ana
' other witnesses. '
â  The jury's verdict was to the effect that
, "death had been due to natural causes.
! hastened by excitement," and this verdict
, was based on the testimony of Dr. v ' Al '
ncr, who had conducted an autopsy ana
; who reported that theÂ»organs of the de-
I ceased's body were very badly debilitated
' and his vitality low. The autopsy physi
cian declared that Holmes, wlrn whs ,o
1 years of age, had been suffering from en
largement of the liver, congested longs,
kidney troubles and leakage in a valve or
the aorta, and that he found no signs of
i suffocation or strangulation. The doctor
therefore contended that death was due to
shock, and not directly to violence.
, George Holmes Is still charged with bat
, tei>wÂ», however, and was released this even
ing' on furnishing $lu<) bail.

NEWS OF THE REALTY WORLD
THERE has been a decided improve
ment in the tone of the real estate
market during the past week, and
brokers are correspondingly happy.
The revival in activity which they
have for the past four months been pre
dicting would follow the usual lethargy
of the summer months appears to be close
at hand, and they now look forward to a
brisk business for the remainder of the
present year. According to some of the
best informed among the real estate men.
conditions for a healthy movement in city
property have not been so favorable in
years as they are at present. A number
of good sales have been made during the
past week, the consideration in one case
amounting to $140,000, and others equally
large are in a fair way to be consummat
ed. It was rumored on the stueet yester
day that negotiations for the purchase cf
a big block of land located near that re
cently acquired by the Santa Feâ the al
leged consideration given being $400,000â
had reached a stage that rendered the
closing of the deal a practical certainty;
but the rumor could not . be verified and
is probably based on negotiations which
are known to be In progress for a large
piece of property in the district south of
Market street, the price, however, being
much less than that stated.
G. H. Umbsen's Real Estate Record for
August says that although business in
the real estate market was not lively In
August and the festivities attendant
upon the reception of the California vol
unteers interfered somewhat with trans
actions, there are signs of the prospective
fall trade. Inquiry for good investment
property has again set in, but purchasers
are indisposed to pay fancy prices. Taken
all in all, August was a fair month, and
the situation promises moderate activity
during the autumn.
The largest transaction reported was
the sale by A. J. Rich & Co.. acting for
J. L. Haskell, of the property situated
on the north line of Market street, .167
feet west of the intersection of Market
and Turk, with a frontage of 25 feet on
each of the streets named, to Mrs. Mary
F. Barron. The price paid was $140,000.
A peculiar thing in connection with this
transaction is the statement of a broker
that he offered the same property to Mrs.
Barren a month or two ago for $135,000, and
the offer was refused.
Shainwald. Buckbee & Co. sold the
three-story brick building at 436 and 438
California street, now occupied by the
Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company, to
Edward Pollitz & Co., the security brok
ers. The lot has a frontage of 25 feot
and a depth of 68:9. and the price paid
was $50,000. The purchasers intend alter
ing the building to meet their business
needs, but this work will be deferred until
the expiration of the lease held by the in
surance company, which runs until June
1, 1900.

A. M. Speck & Co. have sold the lot

SIXTY CENTS ONE MILL
TO BE THE STATE RATE
The Equalizers Decide That No
County Shall Be Raised.
Attempt to Increase Assessment of Alameda
andOtherCountiesFailsâ Dalton'sGloomy
Picture, Pardee's Joker, Daniels' Bomb.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. I.â The State Board of Equali- >
?ation held an executive session this evening and concluded â¦
its labors. o
It was decided that the State rate shall be 60 cents and 1 Â£
mill; the total assessment of the State is $1,194,000,000. The +
board must fix the levy before next Tuesday, and as Mon- â¦
day is a legal holiday its work is now closed. 4
Alameda County will not be raised, nor will any other +
counties. An attempt was made by Lou Brown and Reamer ,v
to raise Alameda 15 per cent, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and +
Mendocino 10 per cent each. The other members wanted to +
raise some counties in Beamcr's district, but he objected to >
having a single raise in his district. +
After much discussion Lou Brown, Alexander Brown Â°
and Toland stood together and passed a m-otion that all the o
counties should stand as they are. o
The State rate last year was 48 cents and 8 mills; the o
total valuation $1,131,059,703. o
SACRAMENTO, Sept. I.â The picture .
of Oakland painted before the State
I of Equalization to-day by Ala
meda County's Assessor was not at j
all roseate. It was not the kind of pic
ture that the Mfrchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade would like the world
to see. Mr. Dalton could not are a single
lift In the clouds that hung over Alame- i
da's capital. Everything is depreciating,
business is falling off and Oakland is not
â  as valuable as she was a few years
ago.
1 r five hours Dalton was plied with
tions by the State Equalizers, and for I
live hours Mr. Toland regretted that they
could learn nothing. Mr. Colgan fre- .
quently reminded the Assessor from Oak
land that the State board had not singled j
out Alameda County to light with, but
ted some facts.
si ir Dalton was on the aggressive!
from the start, and when he lagged Dr. j
G. C. I'ardee put in a few words to pre- i
i break. Many things which had i
hitherto appeared dark were cleared up !
. the afternoon and evening. The ;
: â â¢â¢. of Dr. Pardee created some sur
but later the doctor said he knew
that the assessments on his property bad
been supplied to the board, and so he'
came to do his own talking. For some
months Mr. Beamer, Lou Brown and oth- ,
ers have been Hitting in and out of the j
rd< r's office in Oakland. Several men i
who do not believe that the sun rises and
:i Alameda's Assessor were observed
i rly assisting in the search for
data. This evening it was all made clear.
Not a newspaper report nor a mortgage
nor an appraisement nor an assessment in
the whole county waa missing from the
few memoranda that Beamer and Lou
Brown had on hand. In many instances
the stale Equalizers knew more about the
tank deals and losses and family arrange-
ments merely hinted at in deeds than did '
the Assessor or his deputies.
Mr. Toland seemed to be. under the Im
pression that Mr. Dalton waa seeking an
argument, but he was not. Jt is only a â 
way they have in Alameda County, and â 
Mr. Toland has DOt graduated from the j
Athens of the Pacific.
One little piece of dialogue was relig
iously gone through at intervals never <x
ceedlng fifteen minutes. It consisted of I
Mr. Toland asking for a reason for cer- j
tain reductions, to which Mr. Dalton in- j
variably replied, "I believed that to be a
Just and fair assessment or 1 would not
have sworn to my rolls."
"Then we may as well presume," said
Toland, "that this is your answer to every
question we shall ask you. You need not !
have ;:ome here If you cannot enlighten
us. You could have sent us that answer
on a postal card."
Then Dr, Pardee, who was sitting on a
BOfa with Supervisor Rneth, would whis
per: "This Is the dolgonest farce I ever
Keep at it. Henry."
But the doctor had not been sworn and
was in no danger of perjury.
Henry "kept at it," and when the State
equalizers seemed to be snoring a good
point he could always fall back on his con.
Bdence and his oath, and then the little
dialogue would be repeated.
The assessment roll of Oakland city has
been decreased from 18:*7, and Mr. Dalton
was aÂ«ked to explain. "The city is not jo
valuable as it. was last year," said Mr.
Dalton. "It has not the business. Realty
has depreciated, there have been no im
provements of any size and I believe my
assessment-"' are just and fair."
"But has the city gone so entirely to the
bad? Is property depreciated every
where?" asked Lou Brown.
"I believe it has. I have assessed it for
every dollar that it is worthâ its cash
value," said Dalton.
"Have all the bay cities been going
lack?" asked Lou Brown.
"They have," was the Judgment of the
man on trial.
Dalton said the work had been done
more thoroughly this year than last; his
deputies had been more careful. He re
minded the board that In 1897 they had
reduced his assessment 10 per cent, and
that since then he had been guided by
their judgment.
"Did you raise it when we raised it?"
asked Colgan.
"No. I did not," said Dalton.
"Well, I only wanted to know how long
you stayed with us," ea^d the Controller, i
"I per you have the Peventh-Ftreet local
on the roils." Bald Chairman Brown.
"Thai's v habit you have got Into," said
Beamer.
"No, sir: a duty," replied Dalton.
Chairman Brown mentioned Los An- j
poles. Mr. Dalton was "factlfled" on Log
Angeles. He rattled off ,1 lot of figures to j
show th.it Alameda's assessment com
pared very favorably with that of the j
southern county. Dalton showed that ]
from July 1 of last year, when the revenue |
law went Into effect, to March 1 of this'
year there were 1491 transfers recorded.
indicating a value of $3,491,000. The total
asÃ< -sment of these pieces was $2,708, 500,
or 77 ; - per cent of their actual selling
price. Mr. Dalton was driving home his
argument in the peculiar way they have
in Oakland when Mr. Toland paid: "Pro
ceed with your figures, Mr. Dalton. You
cannot get into a row with any one here
over this affair."
"I am not seeking 1 any row," said Dal
ton; and neither was he. Dr. Pardee
| again commented on the proceeding to
Mr. Roeth.
Lou Brown sprung a bunch of deeds in
r*-j>]y to some quoted by Mr. Dalt'>n.
Brown's deeds all showed that the assess
ments were not more than about one-
I half the selling price. Dalton referred to
1 "picking" out certain deeds merely for
I a purpose. This brought all the Equallz
j ers to attention, and they promptly de
nied such implications.
"I wish to say that Mr. Brown and I
took these figures from your county rec-
I ords, and there was no picking," said
! Beamer.
"Then let us have pome of the deÂ»ds
j that come the other way," Bald Dalton.
I But none were on the Equalizers' list.
"We don't want you to tell us of Los
Angeles County." paid Toland. "We have
I all that fin record. We sent for you to :
I tell why AJameda County should not be
raised. Please just answer our ques
tion?."
"There is no desire here to quarrel,"
said Colgan, "No one is inclined to do any
badgering. I want to say for the whol<*
board that we have no programme to
make a light on any particular county. !
We want enlightenment."
The. "Doc" repeated his remark about (
the peculiar kind of farce. At Intervals i
the Alameda Supervisors and Mr. Dal- |
ton's deputies interjected a few remarks.
but they were not much sought after and !
' merely gave the Assessor from Oakland
time to regain his breath.
After a few- sharp remarks from Beamer. l
Toland and Lou Brown, the "enlighten-!
ing" process was essayed by Mr. Dalton. j
No sooner was it started than the hoard i
showed that it had (-â¦a'-ks upon stacks of :
enlghtenment. Ti was present in clippings !
I from newspapers, in illustrated histories ;
i of Alameda County, in long strings of
; data from public offices, find the only I
j thing lacking was some of the Alameda
i Assessor's political speeches.
The board closely questioned thA As
; sessor on the losses made on certain
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1899,
pieces of property by banks. Mr. Dalton
let it be known that he does not think
very highly of some of the losses made by
the I'nloii Savings Bank. He thinks more
favorably of the Central Bank people and
in the case of some losses made personally
by the late J. "West Martin. Dr. Pardee
was inclined to think they would repre
sent about the real value of the property.
The Equalizers sprung one record of a
deed and mortgage too many. It referred
to a transfer of the Patterson ranch,
which had been mortgaged for $45,267 and
was ;Ls.sessed at $1!5,0W. Dalton was pre
pare d for this, and he played a trump
card. He filed an affidavit with the board
from Attorney T. C. Hurley, swearing
that the ranch was originally mortgaged
fur SiMi.oOO, and that the balance was for
accrued interest, and that the recent sale
was for $12.i.KX>. for which sum the entire
mortgage of $-i">.::h7 was wiped out.
The Contra Costa Water Company's as
sessment was taken up. Beamer referred
to a sworn statement made to the City
Council that the plant was worth $6,000,-
OiK.i. The total assessment is over $2,000,
--080, and Dalton said that the plant
could be duplicated for the assessment to
day. Toland asked if the Oakland Coun
cil lixod rates on the company's figures,
and Dalton informed him that it depended
entirely on how much of the City Council
the corporation owned. These references
to a corporation being able to dictate to
a City Council seemed something new and
strange to Lou Brown, and lie sought
more light. Dr. Pardee and Mr. Dalton
gave it to him.
"Here are Dr. Fardee's assessments,"
said Beamer.
â¢â¢That's the joker that brought me
hero." said the doctor.
The deeds referred to two pieces of
property on San Pablo and Telegraph av
enues. The doctor had executed a deed
of trust to Isaac L. Requa for $52,000 to
the properties. They were assessed for
$50,000.
'â¢What would you sell them for, doc
tor?" asked Beamer.
"1 would not take less than $100,000 for
them " said Pardee, "but that does not
say they nro worth that."
"Are they worth as much now as they
were two years ago?"
"They are." â¢
"That is the first time we have been able
to discover a piece of property that has
not depreciated in Oakland."
"I think that is about right," said
Dalton.
"But you may have made a mistake,"
said Toland.
"No. I have not."
"But you surely do not thtnk you are
infallible?" retorted Toland.
1 >r. Pardee' a homestead was next tnken
up. This is the property at Tenth and
Castro streets, where the doctor's father
lived a long and useful life. This is as
sessed fur $15,000 and Dr. Pardee said that
although the place is priceless to him and
he could set no cash value on it. he be
lieved $20,000 would be a fair appraisement
as the house was built in JWS. The board
seemed to be quite satisfied with Mr.
Dalton's figures on the doctor's property.
Lou Brown read several reductions that
had been made on the very best business
property in the heart of Oakland, where
trade is rapidly increasing. Not a single
increase was found and Dalton again re
ferred to "picked" assessments.
"I take positive exception to your man
ner, sir; let us have no badgering," said
Toland.
Then Dr. Pardee whispered to Toland:
"You fellows get hold of a few trifles
and raise hades."
The Centennial Hotel assessment
brought out some more history. It Is as
sessed for $38,750. Records show that it
was mortgage,! for $m>,ooo, then for tM),000
and finally sold to a syndicate for $120,W8.
Mr. I>alton said he had no idea that a
syndicate paid any such sum. He then
recited the case of the Albany Hotel
transfer three years ago, where the deeds
showed a consideration of $1f>5.000 and on
which $70,000 was borrowed. A row among
the heirs later produced the sworn testi
mony in court that the property had ac
tually changed hands for $70,000. Dalton
said "he believed the Centennial deal was
just such another case.
Finally Mr. Beamer produced a set of
bids that he had received from Washing
ton. It consisted of thirty-three bids on
pieces of Oakland realty offered for a
Postoffice site. All of these bids are about
twice the assessed values. Toland said
that as these bidders were anxious to sell
it was fair to presume that they repre
sented the least cash price they would
accept.
Dalton said tfiat puch figures were no
criterion ns everybody considered it
necessary to try to rob the Government.
He said that mortgage and appraisements
as nt preseni manipulated were very lit
tle guide to actual values. After a con
cluding disagreement over this statement
the long session concluded and Alameda
County waa taken "under advisement."
DANIELS' BOMB.
Enquirer FropriÂ«tor Says He
Was Offered a Big Bribe.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 1.â "I wish to
say right here that I was offered $3000
to assist in selling a site to the Govern
ment for a postoffico in Oakland."
This was the positive and unsolicited
statement made before the State Board
rif Equalization to-day at Sacramento by
G. B. Daniels, proprietor of the Oakland
Enquirer.
The board was comparing the prices
asked by bidders from the United States
Government for postofflce sites. The dis
sension was upon the relation of such
ligures to the true value of such sites,
and several opinions were offered. The
prevailing sentiment seemed to be that
there were other expenses to be consid
ered. It was then that Daniels made his
sensational declaration. When seen later
Daniels said he had nothing to add to
his statement.
"I was asked by an Oakland dealer to
use mv influence in securing the purchas
ing or his site, and he would give me
j:;'">0 when the deal was closed," he said.
"I may say that I do not believe the man's
bid is among those that were sent to
Washington.'
Agent Roberts of the Treasury Depart
ment was instructed to inspect all the
sites offered, and his report is now in
Washington. Nearly every prominent
realty manipulator in Oakland has an in
terest in one or more sites offered, and"
the high figures placed on some of the
properties have caused much comment.
There have been rumors of certain deals
being made and of the possibility of
money being used, but nothing definite
has hitherto been brought to light.
Daniels declined to tell who offered him
the money.

FAMOUS SINGLE-TAXER
EXTOLS HENRY GEORGE
0 JOHN SHERWIN CROSBY SPEAKS BEFORE THE PRESS CLUB. 0
â  q Â£=r=3HE single-taxers had an inning last night at the Press Club. It was q
i V the occasion of a reception to John Sherwin Crosby, the friend of _^
O Henry George and now the foremost worker in the single-tax cause, q
; â 4- [i Quite a few people gathered in the jinks room of the club to hear the
'â  Â© speaker and all were entertained by his natural and homely eloquence. q
: -4- Nothing was said in exposition of single-tax theories. Mr. Crosby's in-
O formal address was confined to reminiscences of Henry George, a laudation q
-4- of newspaper men ana a glowing tribute to me man whose work he has +
' Â© taken up. Wells Drury was chairman of the evening and introduced Mr. q
+ Crosby to his audience. -â¦â¢
V "it is an inspiration to be in the company of those who enjoyed the Â©
rt privilege of associating with Henry George in his early days," said Mr. Â±
> Crosby. "Tane. it all in all I think he was the greatest man of the cen- *Â»
â  O tury if not of all centuries. He was a man who wrote and said what he Â£
I â¦ believed. The philosophy of Henry George is just a part and parcel of the -^
1 Â© universe. Many have tried to refute his theories and the principles for JjJ
! rt whici he labored so arduously the last fifteen years of his life. Their refu- q
I V tations have been arguments in support of his theories. * -4
! Â© "What progress tais great worker made in the cause of humanity is Q
' It demonstrated by the spontaneous approbation of the human heart in the &
i 2 tribute paid him at his funeral. No one who ever saw the cortege<spas3 J)J
I X through the streets of New York will ever forget it. People lined the streets q
and packed the sidewalks. As the funeral procession passed a sob or two +
q was heard along the line of march. All grief was held in restraint ' until q
X the cemetery was reached, when with a common outbreaking of emotion .4.
rt the assembled mourners gave way to the grief that was in them. The peo- q
X rle realized that they had lost a great friend. +
q "I am not a pious man and I know there were many who felt the same q

rt I thought of the words of the Scripture: 'If I be lifted up I will draw all Q

O now." 2
â *â  Many of the local singlc-taxers followed Mr. Crosby in personal recollec- i
tions of Henry George. The meeting lasted until 11 o'clock, a general dis- _jj
Q cussion ending the reception. Â©

PEDAGOGUES MAY NOT
LOSE THEIR SALARIES
Plans of School Directors Did
Not Carry.
Teachers Must Be Paid Even if Schools Are
Closed, and a Motion to Cut Pay Fifteen
Per Cent Per Month Was Voted Down,
HT its meeting last night the Board
I\\ of Education neither . slashed
Jj- â *\ teachers' salaries nor ordered
n \\ the schools closed for three
-weeks in October. It considered
both propositions, but when matters came
to a vote the members divided against
themselves, and as a result department
finances remain in precisely the condition
they were in before the- meetingâ several
thousand dollars shy and no hope of get
ting more unless the Supervisors. bolt the
dollar limit and raise the school appropri
ation the $100,000 prayed for. :
The usual star-chamber proceedings
were omitted from the programme; the
meeting was open; ! and - every member
went plainly on record on the one or the
other of the two plans proposed. The
was no heated discussion nor any parti
san feeling; it was simply a -businesslike
discussion, with the only question that of
the most effective method.
Director Holbrook, chairman of the
Finance Committee, broached money mat
ters in making his report of an Informal
meeting of his committee held on Thurs
day night last. He said that: in view of
the fact that no hope was held out by. the
Supervisors of a larger appropriation he
and his confreres had decided that the
best course to pursue would be to close
the schools for three weeks in October
and withhold the salaries of the teachers
for that period. Three weeks' 'money, he
said, would be sufficient to put the board
financially on its feet until December. In
pursuit of this idea he had requested an
opinion of City and County Attorney Lane
upon the legality of. such action, and
Mr. Lane had rendered an opinion that
though the schools might be closed the
salaries must be paid. In this opinion the
board's attorney, Samuel Knight, con
curred. Mr. Knight also said . that even
if the salaries were withheld the money
so realized could not be applied to any
debts of the board until the end of the
year, as under the law passed by the last
Legislature a special teachers' salary fund
was created, and any surplus occurring
under it could not be used until- the end
of the year, when it reverted to the gen
eral fund. -.--.
With this statement Mr. Holbrook left
the solution of the matter to the hoard.
Director Stow selected the least popular
side as his end of the question. He said
the only way he could see out of the dif
ficulty was to order a temporary cut in
salaries. Mr. Holbrook suggested that the
schools be closed and the teachers asked
-
to assign their salaries to the board's use.
President Bergerot did not think the plan
practicable, and â Mr. Stowe formally
moved that the salaries of all teachers be
cut 15 per cent in the months of Septem
ber, October, November and December.
He was seconded by Holbrook, but the
motion was lost.' Armstrong, Cole, Conlon,
Brandenstein and Gedge voting no.
Gedge then offered a resolution to close
the schools in October and ask the teach
ers -to assign, but President Bergerot
ruled the motion out of order. Further
discussion ensued, and then (lodge moved
a reconsideration of the vote whereby
Stow's motion was defeated in order that :
any one who had changed his mind might
vote again. The. reconsideration carried,
hut when' the original motion was put it
was lost by the same vote, and the school
finances were again in the hands of the
Supervisors.
I Director Holbrook then moved that the
$22,000 in unpaid bills for July and August
be signed and passed and the Auditor al- !
lowed to "light it out" with the creditors
if there were not enough funds on hand
to liquidate.
1 A note from J. 8. -Crockett of the gas
company notified the board . that unless
the $7000 due for, gas was -paid at once all
school lights would be shut off. The fol- j
lowing resolutions. were adopted:
Resolved,' That Miss M. C.' Dowling be
dismissed from . Business F.venlnc School,
her sen-ices being no longer required.
Resolved. That "William Herrod be dis
missed from Business Evening School, his
services being no longer required.
Resolved, That F. H. Dam be assigned to
â¢ Humboldt Evening School, vice Bran, re
signed.
Resolved. That two consolidations take
place; In Lincoln Evening School, one in :
ninth grade and the other In the ungraded
adult .classes.
Resolved. That one teacher be consoli
dated out of Spring Valley Evening School.
Resolved, That H. T. Bickell be ap
pointed a special teacher of bookkeeping
and commercial arithmetic In the Horace
Mann Evening School during the pleasure
of the board.
The report of the Salary Committee
which was made a resolution and adopt
ed, was as follows;
That the salary schedule of 1599-1900 be
amended to read: Teachers of the eighth
and ninth grades,: $83 per month; teachers
of the sixth and seventh grades, J7;Â» per
month as maximum salaries; also that a
yearly Increase of $3 be made to the monthly
pay of teachers of the first, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth and ninth grades until the
; maximum salary be attained.
Second, that the pay of evening substi
tute teachers be fixed at $15 per month, and
that an extra comt>ensatlon of $160 be

. substitutes shall be engaged In teaching.
