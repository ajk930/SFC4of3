LONDON, Oct. ij.â The
Daily Telegraph this morn
ing publishes the following
dispatch from its special corre
spondent.
"LADYSMITH, Sunday, Oct.
15. â All is quiet along the
front The Boers are on the
western side of our lines, but
are still keeping near the passes,
although within the Natal border.
Fine weather and moonlight
nights may induce a forward
movement on their part, or at
any rate, some raids.
"The only shooting thus far
has consisted of an interchange
of shots between patrols on the
Dundee side and a party of
Boers who had crossed Buffalo
River, but no casualties occurred.
Boer scouts are out upon the Na
tal side of Buffalo River.
"I have learned that a number
of Transvaal Boers are with the
Free State Boers on the south
side of Bothnas Pass.
"Ladysmith Camp is in a splen
did defensible situation. It is a
healthy place, and our men and
horses are thoroughly fit. Boer
patrols have been seen occasion

from camp." \
The I >aily Mail's Cape Town
correspondent, telegraphing Sun

"Kimberley is besieged and the
Boers are massing in force. No
details, however, are obtainable.
"The Boers have cut the rail

"The object of these energetic
operations is believed to be the
capture of Cecil Rhodes. Kim
berley is now isolated, both rail
way and telegraphic communica
tion being cut."
The state of affairs at Maf eking
can only be conjectured. The
occupation of Newcastle by the
Boers was prepared for and ex
pected, the place having been
abandoned by the British.
Very heavy rains and snows
are reported, which hamper the
Boer movements, and they are

north or west, as General Sir
George Stewart White's recon
naissance seems sufficient to
deter them for the present.
The peaks of the Drakensberg
Range are covered and the
storms which have occurred
must have caused the Boers great
discomfort, which probably ex
plains their failure to attack Gen

characterizes the operations of
both sides.

YET ATTEMPTED
DURBAN, Oct.' 15.â following offi
cial statement has been published:
"The general officer commanding at
Ladysmith issued forth on Friday morn
ing with a strong flying column and oc
cupied a position covering Ladysmith.
He reconnoitered for the enemy, who
showed no disposition to advance. They
are reported to be inside the Berg at the
foot of Tintwa Pass in force, with a sec
ond command at Olivers â¦ Hock. The
troops have returned to quarters."
It is reported from Glencoe that a large
commando, believed to be Free State
Boers, under Commandant Viljoen, Is at
the foot of Bothas Pass, one and one
half miles on the Natal side of the bor
der.
The Transvaal flag has been hoisted at
Charlestown and Commandant Viljoen
has sent a message to Newcastle saying
the Boers would hoist the Transvaal flag
there on Saturday, but that the people
need not be afraid, as everything the
Boers take will be paid for. They want
to slaughter the cattle. Many people are
left in Newcastle, Including women and
children.
A train of wagons, five or six miles in
length, was seen descending Molls Neck
toward Doornkorp, north of Woolsdrlft.
BOERS CAPTURE
NEWCASTLE AND
KAFFIRS JOIN THEM
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â A Journal cable
from Dundee, Natal, says: I came here
from Newcastle on Friday night, leaving
that town, from which most of the inhab
itants had already fled. Early in the
morning two Kaffir scouts came ln and
reported seeing a large body of Boers at
Spiskop making into Natal. Later lt was
ascertained that the enemy was only a
strong reconnoitering party. But the In
formation caused much anxiety among
the Inhabitants remaining, and Inspector
Pelley and Railway Superintendent Little
john telegraphed to headquarters. They
received orders to evacuate. The post
office and railway station were closed
quickly, while the inhabitants assembled
and boarded trains. Crowds of natives
begged to be taken along. Many were
accommodated.
Just as the train was about to leave the
Kafllr scouts reported the Boers behind
Signal Hill, four miles away. Three white
men and their families decided to remain
in Newcastle. These were Magistrate
Jackson, Police Superintendent McDonald
and Station Master Sims, all of whom are
on friendly terms with the Dutch.
Sims tetegraphed me after the train left
that the Boers, numbering 300, had en
tered the town and informed the pecpie
that all would be well treated and that
there was nothing to fear.
While this force was occupying New
castle a line of wagons several miles long
was observed to the eastward, passing
along the Transvaal side of Buffalo
River. It camped last night at a farm
near Buffalo oridge, fifteen miles -from
Newcastle.
Five thousand Kaffirs in charge of two
Europeans, marching from Johannesburg
arrived at Newcastle yesterday morning
and stopped outside the town. The Boers
and inhabitants sent them food and sup
plies, and after a short rest the huge
procession resumed its march, passing
outside the town. .
The main body of Boers, 15.000 men. left
Newcastle to-day, marching south along
the railway line, intending to proceed to
This place has been occupied by the Boers. To the north of the town Is Signal Hill, which was useu as a heliograph station during the war of ISSO-81 and to which

NO BRITISH KILLED WHEN THE
ARMORED TRAIN WAS WRECKED
Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
LONDON, Oct. .15.â Daily News correspondent at Cape Town has Interviewed Flowerday, driver of the armored
train which was wrecked by the, Boers at Krapan. The Boers opened fire from a sluit (ravine) close by th" rail
road. The party on board the train, numbering fifteen men, took shelter in the armored carriage. A heavy rifle
fire was kept up all night.
"When morning broke the Boers brought up artillery. The defenders hung out flags of truce. These were disre
garded by the enemy, who continued firing for a quarter of an hour. Then, however, they ceased and galloped up on
horseback. ,,.- ...â -<;â >- â¢",'. â¢-â - *â ââ -'â¢â -â  :.--â â¢ "; 'â¢ 'â¢' --"â *-' l^Tf *-*â --, 7 ~- - â¢ ;-;-â¢ .*â¢ -..â â â  _ .

The Boers afterward directed an artilley fire on the engine, firing seven shells.
"W hen the pilot engine was derailed," said Flowerday, "we spent a half hour trying to get lt back on the track.
Then the Boers commenced firing and several men were wounded. The firing was kept up all night, but without effect.
The Boers were careful to concentrate their fire upon the engine so as to save the armored carriage and ammunition
trucks. At dawn they commenced to bombard the cars. I escaped by crawling a mile and a half on my belly in the
sand. When both engines were destroyed Captain Nesbltt exhibited flags of truce, but the Boers continued their firing
for another quarter of an hour. '. r .\ : yy 7j
"There Is no doubt that all the others on the train are prisoners and that the carriage and ammunition intact
fell Into the hands of the Boers."
Dannhauser, which is only ten miles north
of Glencoe and fifteen miles from Dundee,
Other commands are also moving down
both sides of the Natal border, threaten
ing to inclose Dundee and Ladysmith.
Apparently the Boer forces are march
ing in three columns. Viljoen commands
the center and has the artillery. Colonel
Schiel, formerly of the German army and
with a German contingent, accompanies
him. A strong force was left to occupy
and hold Newcastle, and the flag of the
South African republic is now floating
over the Newcastle town hall.
An attack on Dundee on Monday or
Tuesday is expected. The Boers will have
no difficulty in capturing it, and we will
retreat to Ladysmith, where the British
will make their stand.
8 p. Three men, who rode all night
from Ingogo, have just arrived. They say
that 16,000 Boers, with twelve guns, ar
rived at Ingogo, north of Newcastle, on
Friday noon, looted the stores and passed
southward. This force evidently is the
same that occupied Newcastle.
A Kaffir scout reports that the Boer
army has reached Ingagane, less than ten
miles south of Newcastle and about
twenty-five miles north of Dundee. The
advancing column probably has reached
Dannhauser, fifteen miles north of Dun
dee, to-night.
The Boers are compelling Rand refugees
to help haul their cannon.

The railway telegraph officials have

ish point of communication, therefore, to

tide It is the general belief that the
Boers are attacking Mafeking, there is
still no confirmation of the reports. If the
Boers had met with any success it would
surely have been announced, as the only
telegraphic communication is in the
nanus of the burghers. The absence of
news, therefore, is regarded as a good
sign. _ .

VIGOROUS MEASURES PREVENT
AN UPRISING IN MANILA
MANILA, Oct. 15.â The authorities were informed yesterday
from reliable sources that an outbreak in the poorer districts
of Manila had been carefully planned for daylight on Sunday.
It failed to occur, probably on account of the vigorous measures
enforced. Many natives of the Tonds district left, taking their
valuables. All the smaller shops, which the guards usually force
to close at 8:30 P. M., were shut at sunset. A general feeling of
uneasiness was apparent.
The guards of the city were doubled and a strong force sta
tioned at the slaughter-house, the center of the unruly section.
Two guns of the Sixth Artillery were stationed near by at a point
commanding the native quarters. The commanders of the reserve
troops were ordered to be prepared for a call at daylight.
Three native policemen have been arrested on a charge
of plotting an uprising. The fact that their comrades informed
the authorities of their treachery indicates that the police force is
loyal.
Kruger's bodyguard accompanied Mr.
Greene to the border of the Free State,
and he received the same treatment from
the Free State.
The news of fighting at Modder River
is not confirmed. The station master at
Modder River telegraphs that Boers from
the north and south have taken Canger
shat, which they are fortifying.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VRTBURG, Cape Colony, Oct. 15.â A
hospital train that started for Maribogo
has just returned after an adventurous
journey. It had reached a curve on a cul
vert 700 yards south of Maribogo and had
just slackened speed when it was ob
served that the rails ahead had been up
turned. The brakes were applied but the
engine passed onto one rail partly raised
and was derailed. The occupants Imme
diately righted the engine. At the same
time it was observed that a party of
Boers were galloping into line east of the
railway, but well on the Cape Colony side
of the border. Some of the persons on the
train declare that they saw a cannon
pointed at the train. The intention of the
Boers was apparently hostile. The train
ran back to Vryburg at full speed, the
engine flying a white flag with a red cross.
Picks and shovels were seen lying about,
and the Boers had apparently been dis
turbed while removing the rails.
It is learned that previous to the start
ing of the train Maribogo telenhoned Vry
burg asking that a train be sent up. as all
was quite safe. The operator at Vrvburg
recognized the voice as that of a Euro
pean store clerk. In view of the subse
quent report that the Boers were remov
ing the rails it is believed the Boers com
pelled the clerk to speak through the tel
ephone.
The nearest Boer command to Vryburg
is laagered north of Schweizerrenek,
twenty miles distant and two miles in
side the Transvaal. The command sent
a message to the Vryburg railway station
that if the delivery of three wagonloads
of meat and two wagonloads of sugar, re
ceived a week ago. were refused, the
Boers would send 600 men to take them.
This morning all the goods at the station
were made up in two special trucks.

of half a dozen men on each craft, not
a soul was on board. Captain Barr spent
most of the day in town. He has every
confidence in the Columbia, for he says
the months that he. has sailed her In all
kinds of weather during the past summer

SAYS BEDLOE
DID NO WRONG
Edwin Hay's Defense of
the Consul.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHIXGTOX, Oct, 15.â Edwin B. Hay,
counsel for S. W. F. Sylvester, owner of
the steamer Abbey, which was seized as
a filibuster carrying arms and ammuni
tion to the Filipino insurgents, to-day
made the following statement In defense
of Dr. Edwin Bedloe, United States Con
sul at Canton, China, against whom
charges wero made in connection with
the grant of an American registry to the
Abbey: : "' 'JJ 7
"Sylvester sold only one parcel of arms
and ammunition to the Filipinos and that
parcel was sold at a time when the same
was equivalent to assisting the United
States forces, the whole transaction be
ing made with the full knowledge and
consent of the United States officials.
"On or about June 6, 1883, Sylvester en
tered a contract with the Filipinos to sell
and deliver 5000 Mauser rifles, dOO.IWO
rounds of ammunition and two Maxim
guns, the price to include cost of a
Bteamer delivery, etc. ' The British
steamer Basis was purchased, the
merchandise secured and details arranged
for the expedition, but as the goods were
being placed aboard the steamer the Br*t
lsh Government revoked the export per
mit.
"Sylvester believed it was his duty
either to deliver the goods or to sell to
the best advantage and make settlement
with the Filipinos for the cash they had
advanced. He tried in various ways to
get the expedition on! during Juno and
July, when, believing it would be impos
sible to accomplish this, he sold to the
Chinese officials at Canton the arms and
ammunition. The terms of this sale were
â¢ne-third cash, one-third in thirty days
and one-third in sixty days. Upon mak
ing the delivery the Chinese objected to
492 Mauser rifles and 500,000 rounds of am
munition, and as there was no ammuni
tion for the Maxim guns they declined to
accept these. This Sylvester left with the
goods on his hands, and also the ship, of
which. under the above conditions, the
Filipinos were the largest owners, and he
determined to try and deliver this small
quantity to close up the transaction.
"The Pasig was changed from a British
register to an American register, under
the name of the Abbey, In the United
States consulate at Canton, then under
charge of Dr. Bedloe. It was a purely
routine proceeding, and any other con
sular officer in Dr. Bedloe's place must
have acted as he did.
"The Abbey sailed from Canton about
August 28. Sylvester left Hongkong on
September 3 and arrived at Manila on
September 6. All stopped at Manila for
over a month, living at the principal
hotels and associating with army and
navy officers. The Manila newspapers
had full accounts of the landing of the
Abbey's cargo at Batangas, so that the
fact of the arms and ammunition being
furnished to the Filipinos was in posses
sion of the. army -and navy authorities,
and yet not a word was said. - â  'â¢ .'
"Sylvester, after arranging .for .the
final settlement and â  transfer of the
steamer, left Manila near the end of Sep
tember, with all the ship's papers. He
had stipulated with Aguinaldo that the
ship was not to be used until he had time
to take the papers to Canton and cancel
then' thereby relleveing the United
StatflF Government from any â¢ responsi
bility should the Filipinos use her in
carrying arms or troops in their cam
paign against the Spaniards of the
southern groups of islands during the
armistice and peace conference. The ship
was not to be transferred to the Filipinos
until after the registered papers had been
killed.
"Upon arriving at Hongkong Sylvester
learned that* a telegram had been sent to
Admiral Dewey at Kong station that the
steamer Abbey had : left Macao about
September 23 with a second expedition.
There was not the slightest foundation
for this report. It was actuated purely
by malice on the part of certain enemies

Shortly after 12 o'clock they went aboard

on board while the steamer was cruising
about the bay with Sir Thomas Lipton
and some of his guests. on the quarter
deck. The men want some wind for to
morrow's race, just as much as the Co
lumbia's crew do, and it is plain to see
that - the continuous failure of the wind
on race days has had a depressing ef
fect on them.
Captains Hogarth, Wrlnge and Parker
have predicted that there will be no wind
until Tuesday or Wednesday, or until
the moon changes, and as they made this
statement several days ago to Sir Thomas
Upton, and the forecast has so far proven
true, the opinion of these experts is well
worth consideration.
Captain Matthews of the Erin, skipper
with as long if not longer experience on
the water, holds the contrary opinion,
and says that there is just as likely to be
a steady wind to-morrow as a week from
that time, and that the change of moon
has been proven by statistics to have
nothing whatever to do with the weather
conditions. v. . .
BARR NOT ALONE.
Has a Corps of Competent Advisers
Always at His Side.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â There is a feel
ing among the Columbia people and by
this is meant the men who are managing
the boatâ the public has been misled
to a degree in regard to the handling of
the Columbia on race days. They feel
that certain comments have been unjust,
in that they lead one to believe that Cap
tain Barr is entirely alone, so far as pro-
clonal talent is concerned. At the New
York Yacht Club to-day a yachtsman of
national reputation, and one deeply inter
ested in the success of the Columbia,
authorized the Associated Press to say
that not only is Captain Barr not alone
in the sailing of the American boat, but
he has at all times at his side for imme
diate counsel and advice the most skillful
yacht sailor in all the world in the person
of Nat Herreshoff.
"The owners and backers of the Colum
bia, including the amateur yachtsmen
on board, have the utmost confidence in
Mr. Herreshoff. not only as a skillful de
signer of racers, but also as a great race
sailor. . With Captain Charlie Barr at the
wheel and Designer Herreshoff at his
side the Columbia people are firm in their
conviction that the best professional sail
ors in the land have been engaged. Fur
ther than this, the owners and backers
of the Columbia, who are now on board,
have also the feeling that the profession
als ha% : e the backing of the best amateur
talent obtainable. They have just as
much confidence in Mr. Iselln and his
friends as ever, and they point to past
success and a whole season of admirable
management as a foundation of their con
fidence. .
This is the feeling among all the Colum
bia people to-night, and, so far as can be
learned.. it is the feeling of the New York

McKINLEY STOPS
AT SIOUX CITY
Spends a Very Quiet
Sabbath.
SPEAKS AT SUNDAY-SCHOOL
Â»
ENTERTAINED BY EX-CONGRESS
MAN PERKINS.
. Â»
In the Evening the Presidential Train
Starts Eastward and Will
Make the Next Stop at
Milwaukee.
.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SIOUX CITY, lowa, Oct. 15.â Sunday
has been a quiet day for the Presidential
party. At 10 o'clock this morning the
train was brought down to the Union Sta
tion from a siding and the President and
Mrs. McKinley., with some members of
the- Cabinet, were conveyed in carriages
to the First Methodist Church. Although
no announcement had been made of the
President's intention to attend services
at this church, the building was crowded
and large numbers waited outside, unable
to obtain admission.
After service the party was conducted
by members of the local committee to the
Sunday school of the Whitefield- Meth
odist Church, where the President was
presented to the school by ex-Congress
man George D. Perkins. Addressing the
members of the Sunday school, Mr. Mc-
Kinley said:
"In the hioment I shall tarry, I have
only time to say to' this group of young
people and older people, 'hail and fare
well,' and wish for all of them the reali
zation of all that is noble in life and
church, under a Government of high priv
ilege and great opportunity."
Shortly after noon the â¢ presidential
train was taken from the Union Station
and again conveyed to a side track five
miles from the city, in order to avoid the
scrutiny of the large crowds which con
tinued to throng about the depot. The
people of Sioux City expressed consider
able disappointment because of the late
arrival of the train last night and the
consequent inability to carry out the pro
gramme arranged for and allow the peo
ple a glimpse of the Chief Magistrate.
The President has been urged to attend
receptions and other functions of a pub
lic character to-day, but has steadfastly
refused, preferring to spend Sunday quiet
ly. Toward evening the President's pri
vate car was detached from the train and
he and the members of the Cabinet were
again conveyed to the city, where a quiet
dinner was enjoyed at the residence of
ex-Congressman Perkins.' The train left
for the East soon after 10 o'clock.
The weather was intensely disagreeable,
great quantities of dust filling the air
during the morning and a heavy wind
prevailing. Late in the afternoon a driv
ing rain set in and continued throughout
the evening. Governor Shaw and Senator
Allison accompanied the train in a pri
vate car and will make the trip with the
President as far as Dubuque. Milwaukee
will be reached to-morrow evening.

10,000 people Admiral Dewey departed
from Boston 'to-night on the Federal ex

with his mail ar.d then Governor Rollins
of New Hampshire called. Later, accom
panied by Lieutenant Brumby, the ad
miral left the hotel and walked through
the common to the Somerset Club, where
lunch was partaken of. When the time
came to nave the club the crowd was so
large outside the Beacon-street entrance
that the admiral and party stepped out
to the rear entrance to Branch street.
They walked through the public 'gardens
and nearly to Copley square, thence back
to the common, the admiral apparently
not being noticed. Several naval officers
called.
. The admiral had expressed a wish to see
the Shaw, memorial, so he and his friends
went again to the common and after,
viewing the tablet returned to the hotel,
followed by a large crowd of people. The
admiral remained in his apartments with
his son during the rest of. the afternoon
The. admiral left the ; hotel in a closed
carriage for the railway station under
the escort of about twenty mounted police
officers.. The crowd which followed was
a large one, but a greater one was at the
station. The party at once went aboard
the express, which immediately left, the
enthusiastic people running down the
track after it.

SURVIVORS OF
LAURADA IN PORT
Brought to Seattle by
the Corwin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Oct. 15.â the United
States revenue cutter Corwin, ~ which
reached here to-night, survivors are
brought of the steamship Laurada, which
lies a wreck in Zapadine Bay, St. George
Island. The Laurada, Captain Frank
White, left Seattle September 12 for Cape
Nome with a crew of forty-eight officers
and men and twenty passengers.
She encountered rough weather from th*
start and just before 6 o'clock on the
morning of September 13 was driven by
wind and current into shoal water in Ac
tive Pass,' but after a brief detention she
resumed her voyage. Being loaded deep
the heavy seas broke over her bow again
and again, and by the time the open sea
was reached it had become so serious that
she was forced to turn back and take the
inside passage to New Metlatkatlah,
where the thirty tons of lumber and fifty
tons of coal were put ashore. Thus light
ened she proceeded to Dutch Harbor,
which was reached September 25. At
Dutch Harbor thirty sheep were landed.
The Laurada left Dutch Harbor Septem
ber 26, encountering contlnuued stormy
weather.
On September 27 it was discovered that
a leak had been started forward by tha
pounding of the seas. This Increase, rap- I
idly and soon it became evident the pumps
would not much longer Keep the vessel i
afloat. She began to gradually settle by
the head. The only hope of safety now !
lay In reaching the Pribylof or Seal Is
lands, the southernmost of which St.
George, Is barely 225 miles from Dutch
Harbor. At 2:30 p. m. September 28, Cap
tain White, after having skirted the east
ern shore of St. George Island and finding
: it Impossible to make a safe landing, ran :
! the now sinking Laurada ashore in the !
shallow waters of Zapadine Bay. The fire
in the lower grate had by this time been !
extinguished by the rising sea waters and
the stokers were wading in the flreroom
up to their knees. , r^
On the side of the island are two small
frame salthouses, used for the storage j
and curing of sealskins by the North
American Commercial Company, which
has a lease of the islands from the Gov- i
ernment. The smaller of these was va- j
cant, and the crew and passengers of the i
Laurr-da moved in. Provisions and other i
necessities were taken from the ship. All
the livestock was successfully landed. It
was on October 3 that the Corwin, Cap
tain Herring, which had left St. Michael
for Seattle and San Francisco on Septem
ber 30, sighted the signal of distress fly
ing from the mast of the Laurada. Cap
tain Herring consented to receiVe the pas
sengers and crew and convey them back
to Dutcn Harbor. The third mate of the
Laurada was left on the island to pro
tect the ship and cargo from being taken
possession of as a derelict, and six pas
sengers remained to care for outfits they
were unwilling to abandon. .' ;
The Corwin's store of â¢ Provisions was
replenished from the abandoned vessel,
and the cutter made sail for Dutch Har
bor with a total of 135 persons on board,
arriving on the afternoon of October 4.
Here the Laurada's passengers were pro
vided with blankets and made as com
fortable as possible. The mail carried by
the Laurada was also brought back by
the Corwin and will be forwarded by the
next available steamber, northbound.
The Laurada was built in Great Britain
and became famous shortly before the
outbreak of the late Spanish-American
War as a filibuster and successful
blockade runner. ;.v â  :.-7.

Colonel Dady's Sensational
Statement Regarding Ha
vana Contracts.
REPORT SUPPRESSED
Told if He Would Do Something for
the Right Parties His Contraot
Would Stand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON-, Oct. 15.-Major General
William Ludlow, military governor of
Havana, will receive leave of absence to'
visit Washington In December and one of j
his close friends in this city is authority
for the diction that he will not return I
to Cuba.
Should this prediction prove to be well
founded. General Ludlow's retirement
from his present office will be due to
events which throw light on the retire
ment of General Alger from the War De
partment.
The story of these occurrences centers
about the tract of Michael J. Dady &
Co. for sewering and paving Havana
Colonel Dady, bo is one of the Republi
can leaders In Kings County, New York,
began his negotiations with the city of
Havana for tnis work in lUM, when the
Havana Common Council invited pro
posals for a system of .vers and pave-'
ments. Colonel J>ady submitted eighteen <
proposals, one of which was accepted. '
l.nder his contract he was to receive
about (13,000,000 in fifty-year bonds, to be
redeemed in annual payments.
When General Ludlow as made mill- i
tary governor of Havana Colonel Dadv
applied to him for permission to proceed
under his contract. General Ludlow sent
him to Washington ancl told him to see !
Qeneral Alger. The latter told him to go |
back to General Ludlow, who again Bent \
hira to the Secretary of War. ]
Colonel Dady was informed at this I
stage of the proceedings that if he would
"do something" for "the right people" his
contract would be all right. He turned a
deaf ear to these suggestions and insisted '
on an investigation. j
All these reports were pigeonholed in the
War Department, and Secretary Alger
and General Ludiow, It is asserted, re- '
fused to allow anything to oe done either
in Havana or in tnis city.
Then Colonel Dady demanded that the
matter be laid before the President's Cab- i
met for decision.
Secretary Alger promised to present the
matter to the Cabinet on a certain day.
On the day after the -â¢Kited meeting
lie wrote a letter to Colonel Dadj saving
the case had been brought before the Cab
inet and that the Attorney General had
given a specific report adverse to Dadv's !
Interests.
Three members of the Cabinet are au- !
thority for the assertion that both the
statements were absolutely false. General i
Alger did not bring thf- matter up and the
Attorney General made no report. It was I
predicted at this time that Secretary' Al
ger could not long remain a member of
the Cabinet of whose deliberations he
wrote false reports.
He left the department one week later
for his trip to Michigan to inaugurate his
boom for the 3 . â¢ -ship. When he re
turned he found the department under the
virtual control of Assistant Secretary
Melklejohn and Adjutant General ' irbin. i

HONOLULU MOURNS
JOHN PHILLIPS' DEATH
HONOLULU, Oct. S.â Hundreds of people in Honolulu mourn the passing
away of Hon. John Phillips, "Honest John," as he was generally called.
For some weeks past he had struggled for life, but without avail.
John Phillips -was born In Scotland about fifty-five years ago, and
In early life went to Canada. Thence he went to St. Paul, Minnesota,
from which place he Journeyed to San Francisco, where he has many
friends. About 1553 he came to the Islands and Boon made his mark by his
sterling and manly attributes. He was a man whose quiet influence was never
excelled here. Twice elected a member of the House of Nobles under the mon
archy he was also the popular representative in the Council of State of the
republic.
In Masonry he was among the highest in the land, both in the lodge of Master
Masons. Royal Arch Chapter and Knights Templar. He was a widower and left
two children to mourn his loss, a daughter about 18 and a son about 16.
NEW TIME TABLE
VERY UNPOPULAR
Business Men of Sacra
mento Make Protest.
Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. Much dissat
isfaction is expressed by the traveling
public over the new train arrangement of
the Southern Pacific with reference to
Sacramenlo. the effect of which will he
to greatly discommode the people of this
city.
Beginning to-morrow the new overland
flier is to be put on. Its advent had
been looked forward to with delight, but
the announcement has been made that
Sacramentans will not be permitted to
ride upon it. This of itself was a disap
pointment, but it was nothing to the dis
gust which was experienced when it was
learned that the railroad company in
tended to take oft the 2 p. m. train for
San Francisco and substitute a train at
4:05 p. m., whose course to San Francisco
would be dependent upon the time the
down Oregon express would strike Da
visville, some twenty miles west of Sac
ramento.
To wait upon the uncertainties of an
overland train certainly does not strike
the people of a city as large and im
portant as Sacramento as either desirable
or fair, and strong pressure will be
brought to bear upon the Southern Pacific
officials to consider the wants of the vast
number of people who regularly make
trips for business and pleasure between
this city and the metropolis. It is true
that there remains the west bound over
land, due at 4:50 p. m. and leaving at 5:10
p. m.. but it is habitually late, sometimes
being three and four hours behind time,
and quite generally from half an hour
to one hour. - -7
The feeling in the business community
has awakened action by the Chamber of
Commerce, as will be seen by the follow
ing letter addressed to the passenger de
partment of the Southern Pacific:
T. H. Goodman, General Passenger Agent,
Southern Pacific Company, San Francisco,
Cat â Dear Sir: Referring to your new time
card: The present local of 2 p. m., which
nas sure to leave on time and arrive In Pan
Fiancisco at 6 p. m.. is abandoned. It was
liberally patronize*!, because our people are
very fond of arriving in San Franclseo In
time to go to the theater or to call on their
friends. In lieu of this train, we get a train
which leaves here at 4:06 p. m. and runs to
Davisville and waits there for the Oregon
train to arrive. In other words, the traveler
ln the afternoon is entirely dependent for his
arrival In San Francisco upon the said Oregon
train and the 6:10 Overland train, which >, are
often late.
This Is the worst accommodation our city
has ever had. and the afternoon travel was
never greater. All who use the railroad will
Join In our request to you to restore the local
2 p. m. train, which has given such satisfac
tion.
We make no comment on the new 2:15 fast
train westward, access to which ls forbidden
us. Very truly yours.

HONOLULU. Oct. B.â The transport
Centennial arrived from San Francisco on
the sth. She brought 300 horses, sixty of
them hanging in slings and ready to die
from simple exhaustion. Two of them
died after reaching port, one breathing its
last on the dock and the other in its sling

days, each one fastened to a stall just
wide enough and long enough for its body.
For eight days the suffering animals had
no sleep no rest whatever. They stood
and kept balance With the rolling of the
ship. A few days more and many deaths
from exhaustion could not have been
avoided. The horses started as fresh,
spirited animals, brought from Nevada

a large proportion of them only kept alive
by stimulants. About twenty gallons of
alcohol were given to the horses during
the Centennial's trip. The animals were
unloaded here and will be turned out to

Admiral's Cousin Talks
to Workingmen.
Special Dieratch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Wash., Oct. IB.â "I declare
myself a socialist; I believe ln national
paternalism and in Governmental owner
ship of all industries. The competitive
system of labor is to-day the curse of the
tollers. There is no hope for the better
ment of the evil conditions which now
exist as a result of the antagonism of
capital and labor save in the establish
ment of a socialistic form of Govern
ment."
These words were the keynotes of an
address delivered to-day to an audience
of union wcrklngmen by a special agent
of the Federal Department of Labor sent
here to Investigate the Cour d'Alene riots
and other labor difficulties. The speaker
was Adelbert M. Dewey, cousin of th\

ily. His words created considerable of a
sensation.
. Speaking of the Cour d'Alenes Mr.
Dewey said: "I, who am one of you, say
to you that labor organizations cannot
afford to stand sponsor for crime." This
won applause. The speaker also coun
seled his hearers to moderation in the use
of Intoxicants to the end that they might
never while under the Influence of liquor
do ought to bring discredit upon organ

IRVING AND TERRY
SAIL FOR THIS COUNTRY
Famous English Actors Will Produce
the Drama "Robespierre" and
Other Productions.
LONDON, Oct. lo.â Despite their earlier
intention to take a faster ship. Sir Henry
Irving and Miss Ellen Terry, with their
full company, sailed for the United States
this morning on the Atlantic transport
line steamer Marquette, which is due to
arrive in New York October 25 or 26. A
large number of personal and profession
al friends accompanied the actors from
the Albert dock to Oravesend, and a fare
well breakfast was held on the ship.
Among those present were Messrs.
Comyns Carr, Henry Dickens, son of the
novelist; Robert Tabor and Miss Alma
Taden. To a representative of the As
sociated Press Sir Henry said:
"While this is our fifth American tour,
I feel that we have never gone to the
United States under more auspicious cir
cumstances. In the first place, the cordi
ality between the two nations was never
greater than it is at the present time,
and while my personal relations with
American theater-goers have always been
of the most delightful character, lt Is
pleasant to feel that the two nations now
recognize the ties of kinship as never be
fore.
"I believe that 'Robespierre,' with which
we will open at the Knickerbocker, will
justify my faith in transporting such an
elaborate production. I wanted to give
my American friends something entirely
new, and I had them much in mind while
selecting the piece. Then, too. it is al
ways an inspiration to play to American
audiences, and Miss Terry and myself
really look upon our tour as a means of
brightening up our faculties as well as
entertaining our American friends."

EUROPEAN LABOR SCARCE.
Hawaiian Planters Object to the Im
migration Laws.
HONOLULU. Oct. 8.-The Cabinet re
cently considered a petition from the
Planters' Association to eliminate a clause
In the Immigration rules requiring that 10
per cent of all contract labor
ers brought into the country shall be
Europeans or Americans. The point is
that a bond is required for the compliance
with this rule, and the same is forfeited
if the proportion named Is not adhered to
The planters want this bond requirement
annulled. . c ;.
In their memorial to the cabinet the
planters represented that they had ex
pended every effort to carry out the pro
visions of the law. but were wholly un
able to do so. The troubles with the
Gallclans, Italians and Portuguese were
cited as instances of the hardships en
countered. -7:.'7 \
The Government decided that, while the
planters had acted in good faith In their
endeavors to' secure American and Euro
pean laborers. It did not feel that it had
the authority to eliminate the clause re
ferred to, holding that the authority rest
ed with the Legislature only.

PRESIDENT ANDRADE OF
VENEZUELA BETRAYED
Revolutionary Force Will Be Allowed to
Enter the Republic's Capital Without
a Struggle.
CARACAS, Oct. 15.â Advices from Petare. ten miles from Caracas, say the
people have risen against President Andrade and a crisis is Imminent. The
commander of the Government forces has betrayed the President and will allow
the revolutionary army to march upon Caracas without a battle.
President Andrade will probably be forced to retire, re-establishing his
government at Maracalbo or Puerto Cabello. Tucacas has been taken by the
revolutionary forces.
United States Minister Loomis recently made a long argument before President
Andrade, urging a suspension of the law relative to foreign insurance com
panies, the enforcement of which, the Minister said, would drive all such com
panies from Venezuela. The result of Mr. Loomis' argument was that a suspen
sion of the law was granted until March, when the statutes will be amended by
Congress. This action saves $6,000,000 worth of business to American companies.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â The Dutch steamer Prinz Frederick Henrik has ar
rived to-day from Venezuela. The second officer of the steamer said concerning
the revolution:
"At La Guayara lay a man-of-war lately bought from Italy. She was flying
the Venuezalar. flag and was ready for action. There was no talk at La Gua
yara, where the Prinz Frederick Henrik touched on September 23, of President
Andrade's leaving the country. JJ â¢/ â â "'â 
"At Puerto Cabello, when the Prinz Frederick arrived on September 30, the
streets were barricaded, the windows of the houses were barricaded wltm mat
tresses and bales of merchandise, foreign residents were flying their flag from
house to house and scattering shots were heard at night. General Castro was
near Caracas with 6.000 rebels, it was said.
"The American warship Vixen and two French men-of-war lay at Curacao.
The American sailors had not been ashore for seven and a half months. They
were so wild that they mixed It up with every one they met. The Yankees cleaned
out one entire street known as Murder street and forty of them were sent to
the hospital."
SUGGESTS MANY
NAVAL CHANGES
Annual Report of Chief
Constructor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15.â 1n his annual
report to the Secretary of the Navy Chief
Constructor Hlchborn lays special stress
upon the importance of continuing the
work of improving the plants at the
various navy yards, inviting particular
attention to those at Boston and League
Island. A plant is also recommended at
Algiers, La., as without it the new dock
will be worthless when completed. Un
der the head of drydocks, the report
points out that the present building pro
gramme does not affect the two most Im
portant navy yards, viz.: New York and
Norfolk, at which a new dock of the
largest size is urgently needed, in view
of the rapid increase of the number of
battleships In commission. Marine rail
ways also are said to be necessary for the
economical handling of torpedo boats, and
two . ach are recommended at New York
and one each at Portsmouth, League Isl
land, Norfolk, Port Royal and Mare Isl
and.
Under the head of new construction,
the report sets out the fact that the con
tracts for the more important ships au
thorized by the last Congress could not
be let, because of the limitation placed
upon the cost of armor. Nevertheless
complete specifications for these vessels
have been prepared and are Included in
the report. Work on the design for gun
boat 16, to replace the Michigan, has
been suspended pending definition of
the characteristics that will be permitted
under the treaty with Great Britain.
Fourteen vessels, with the exception of
the Chesapeake and Princeton, torpedo
boats or tugs, were added to the navy
during the last fiscal year; four Spanish
vessels sunk during the war, were raised

and added, and seventeen small gunboats
were purchased or captured on the
Asiatic station and placed on the list. On
the other hand, forty-one vessels were
dropped from the naval list, including the
American line chartered ships, a number
of auxiliary vessels sold, the revenue cut
ters and lighthouse vessels turned back
Into their old service and a couple of
monitors. On July 1 there were building
for the navy forty-eight new vessels. In
addition to those enumerated.
In view of the dela' 1 ' encountered ln se
curing armor for the new ships at sat
isfactory prices, the Chief Constructor
feels that the time is opportune to renew
his recommendation that the department
contract with the ship-builder for the
ship complete, with armor, instead of
making separate contracts for the latter.
Some of the lessons of the war referred
to in the report is the importance of
sheathing ships, as well as restricting
the use of combustible material upon
them, ancl of fire-proofing such material
as must be used. The severe tests applied
by the war to our ships under trying con
ditions of climate resulted satisfactorily,
and little modification of new designs has
been found necessary. The extended use
of electricity as an auxiliary is recom
mended, and the bureau is making great
progress in this direction. The present
strength of the corps of naval con
structors is said to be entirely Insuffi
cient, and a considerable increase is sug
gested, Including an assistant chief of
the bureau.
The report closes with detailed state
ments from the constructors in charge of
the various navy yards of the work per
formed and the plant necessary.
BOOMING THE AMERICAN BOY.
Congressman Berry of Kentucky
Will Introduce the Bill.
CINCINNATI, Oct. Rankin C. Good,
the high school cadet who is prcmotlng
a scheme to name one of the first-class
battleships the American Boy, giving the
schoolboys of the United States the
privilege of contributing to the cost of its
construction, recently called upon Con
gressman Berry in Newport. Ky., to seek
aid in the undertaking.
Colonel Berry states that he promised
to introduce a bill in Congress providing
that the ship shall be named the Ameri
can Boy, that he is corresponding with
Chairman Boutelle of Maine of the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs, and that it was
probable that the resolution would be
favorably reported upon.

ANOTHER MONEY SQUALL BLOWN
OVER.
ONE of the most, encouraging features of the
current activity in trade is the ease and readi
ness with which the money market rights
itself after a period of stringency. More than once
miring the present year money has tightened in New
York until it seemed as if something would have to
give way, but in every case the financial ship has
righted itself with very little outside assistance. It
was only a week ago that operators in Wall street
were paying fancy rates for call loans, and yet the
mere announcement that the Government would an
ticipate the November bond interest was sufficient to
ease things off at once. Accompanying this an
nouncement was a falling off in the demand for
loans, and Wall street breathes freely again. Trade
must be oh solid foundations when such an insig
nificant plaster as the prepayment of interest prompt-
Iv heals the congestion in the commercial body.
The mercantile and industrial reports for the past
week copiously affirm this condition of business.
Only good reports were received from distributive
trade centers, and some markets reported the fail
trade holding out longer than expected. The railway
earnings continued to make a fine showing, the
failures throughout the country were only 164 against
250 for the same week last year, and the bank clear
ings showed a gain of .31.1 per cent over 1898, with
only three important towns (Baltimore. St. Paul and
Omaha) showing a decrease. The wholesale pur
chasing by the people at large, so frequently alluded
to, continued without diminution, and the complaint
was of the scarcity of goods and not of the lack of
demand. Evidently the American people have not yet
finished buying, though they have bought more dur
ing the past twelve months than ever before. Cotton
has advanced and cereals have shown an under
current of strength, as the world's wheat crop is
falling below expectations and the yield of the
minor cereals is turning out less than anticipated.
There is no falling off in the demand for iron and
steel, coal production is particularly heavy, and wool
is meeting with a fine demand on next spring's ac
count. Paper is in quick inquiry, and the news
variety is reported unusually scarce. Tobacco is ac
tive at almost all Eastern and Western markets, lum
ber is as firm and brisk as ever, hides and leather
are stiff and selling heavily and the output of boots
and shoes is phenomenally large. In fact, all down
the line of commodities intense activity at firm quo
tations is reported.
lii California the conditions arc especially encour
aging. The recent rain broke all records for Oc
tober, and while it did a little damage to grapes and
berries and destroyed the old feed here and there, it
was vastly more beneficial than harmful and pre
saged an early and wet winter, as far as any winter
can be presaged in this part of the United States.
At any rate, it gives the croaker no opportunity to
cry a dry season. The demand for produce and mer
chandise is as good here as in the other sections of
the country, and prices for everything are high
enough to afford the farmer, merchant and manu
facturer a good profit. The export trade is receiv
ing more stimulus from the increased tonnage room,
though vessels are still in inadequate supply for the
quantity of goods ordered for export, while internal
tiaffic is seriously hampered by lack of cars. It is
long since San Francisco has been as busy as at
present, for produce and merchandise are pouring
into and out of the city as rapidly as cars and ships
can transport them. With a good winter there is no
reason why this local trade prosperity should not
continue for many months.
According to reports from Topeka the whistles
in every town in Kansas screeched on receipt of the
news of the arrival of Funston and his men from the
Philippines. In any other State than Kansas this
could have been prevented by a judicious wetting of
the whistles.
Dewey's tour of the country will be incomplete
without a trip to San Francisco, and the duty of our
city officials will be neglected if they do not insist
upon his coming.
The British Government has given Buller a "free
hand" in South Africa, but perhaps it won't be so
very free after Oom Paul gets a grip on it.
MUNICIPAL CAMPAIGN.
ROM the large attendance at the Republican
rally on Saturday evening, and from the earnest
rally on Saturday evening, and from the earnest
spirit displayed by the audience, good auguries
can be drawn of the outcome of the municipal con
test. It is now clear the Republican party, has a
ticket which the taxpayers generally .will gladly sup
port. It is to be noted that hardly any statement
made by the speakers during the evening won more
cordial applause than the declaration of Irving M.
Scott: "I came down here to-night to ask every Re
publican and every good citizen to vote a straight
Republican ticket from top to bottom at the next
election. There is not a nominee on the ticket that
any one need feel ashamed of having voted for."
The signs of the time are indeed encouraging.
The business men of the community have begun to
take an interest in politics and to feel the responsi
bility that rests upon them. Evidences of this awak
ened civic patriotism are to be seen everywhere, and,
as the Hon. Horace Davis pointed out in his ad
dress, it is made strikingly manifest in the remark
able registration, which equals that of a Presidential
election.
Many things have combined to bring about this
desirable state of things. In the first place the bright
ening future of the city has roused the energies of
business men to profit by the opportunities that are
now before them, next the long desire for municipal
improvements has begun to prompt men to earnest
action, the defeat of the bosses in the Republican
party under the new primary election law has been
encouraging, and finally the possibilities of municipal
development and improvement under the new charter
have stimulated all classes of citizens to strive ener
getically to procure for the city a good administration
in department.
The salient feature of the new charter is the power
vested in the Mayor. In summarizing those powers
on Saturday evening Mr. Davis put them in this terse
way: 'The Board of Supervisors is made the legis
lative power, and it has charge of the raising of all
money to carry on the city government. The ex
penditure of this money is placed almost wholly in
the hands of seven boards appointed by the
Mayor. These boards are the board of Public
Works, the Board of Education, the Board of Police
Commissioners, the Board of Fire Commissioners,
the Civil Service Commission, the Board of Health
and the Park Commission. You will see, therefore,
the large discretion and the power left to the Mayor.
It requires a man of business judgment and wide ex
perience and knowledge of men, and, above all. an
honest and fearless man. Especially is this so during
the first year, when the Mayor will have the appoint
ing of all the members of all the boards named."
Will it be safe for the people of San Francisco to
vest those powers in the hands of a man of large per-
I sonal ambition in politics, who. desires v . to ' use the
mayoralty as a stepping-stone to higher office?
The Republican ticket, from the distinguished gen
tleman who heads it to the last name upon it. is, made
up of men whom the people can trust." They repre
sent the progressive and at the same time"- the con
servative element of the community. They stand for
improvements and also for economy. It was no self
constituted committee ruled by bosses that nominated
them. They have no affiliations which will hamper
them in the right fulfillment of their duties. That
much was certainly well understood by the repre
sentative audience that gathered to cheer the ticket
on Saturday evening, and therefore Republicans,
independents, taxpayers and the workingmen of the
; community have good reason to be satisfied with the
outlook.

MINERS' CONVENTION.
PUBLIC interest in mining men and mining
matters aroused by the visit of the representa
tives of the American Institute of Mining En
gineers will not diminish with their departure, for
: already the time for the meeting of the annual con
: vention of the California Miners' Association is so
' near that it engages no little of popular attention
' and discussion. The convention this year will be
! something more than a State gathering. Delegates
are expected from rill the surrounding States and
Territories, and the meeting will be virtually a repre
sentation of the mining industries of the whole of
the vast region known as the Greater West.
Rarely if ever have the gold miners of the State
met under circumstances more promising to their
industry than those that now prevail. The commerce
â  and industry of the world have counted largely upon
the continued output of gold from the Transvaal. It
has been confidently estimated that the yield of the
mines in that country would during the coming year
add $100,000,000 worth of. gold to the money of the
world. That hope is now blighted; the Transvaal
supply is shut off. At present all signs point to the
conclusion that no considerable quantity of gold will
be forthcoming from anywhere in South Africa for at
least a year to come, and probably for two years.
That means, of course, the world must look elsewhere
j for its additional gold supply and that mining invest
ors will be quick to turn to every field that promises
: good returns.
The Alaskan gold fields remain a doubtful source
of supply. Up to this time nothing has been done there
but placer mining, and it is questionable whether
quartz mining could be profitably undertaken. It is
to California, therefore, the attention of more con
servative and prudent investors will turn. It is known
that the mineral resources of this State and those of
its neighbors have hardly been thoroughly pros
pected, much less developed. If mining should be
undertaken here with anything like the degree of
energy and the affluence of capital that have been
expended in working the deep mines of South Africa
the results would be surprising even to many of our
own miners.
â¢ It is therefore at a period when the mines of Cali
fornia are exceptionally interesting to all the world
that the convention of the mining men of the coast
is to meet. That they will understand the advantages
given them by the war in the Transvaal is not to be
doubted, and we may expect of them such action as
will tend to profit by the opportunities afforded.
It is to be added that this is a good time to renew
the movement started some time ago for the creation
of a department of mines and mining in the National
Government under the direction of an officer of Cabi
net rank. There is a demand in the larger commer
cial cities for a department of commerce with a Cabi
net officer at the head/of it. There will probably be
also a movement to create a department for the new
colonies with a Secretary at the head of its adminis
tration. All these movements for the increase of the
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1899.
Cabinet will tend to incline Congress to a favorable
consideration of the desire of the mining men for a
proper supervision of their vast industry. In brief,
every promise of the time is good, and the, convention
will have all it can do to attend to the opportunities
before it.
NOW that the municipal campaign is on in
earnest and the various candidates are resort
ing to all manner of means to keep their names
before the public, the people will appreciate the full
value of the resolution introduced by Supervisor Hol
land forbidding the stretching of banners across our
thoroughfares for the purpose of displaying the
names of the political aspirants of any party.
A display of banners designed for decorative pur
poses and having in the brightness of their coloring
a glow of beauty is an attraction pleasing to the eye.
and the public sees with no little pleasure the flags
and banners which have been put as adornments along
the streets in .honor of the jubilee of the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows. It would, however, be a
grievous offense to every intelligent and artistic citi
zen to see interspersed with those flags great stretches
of canvas sprawled across the street and marked in
scare-horse letters "Vote for Yon Ginnis de Muggens,
the Mugwump candidate of the people for Pound
keeper."
The practice of such advertising in the past has
been overdone. It is time to put a stop to it alto
gether, and the resolution finds public sentiment
already formed in its favor. There is no reason why
the thoroughfares of the city should be made hideous
at every election by that style of political advertising.
There are abundant means by which candidates can
keep their names before the voters without defacing
the streets. Supervisor Holland has taken a step in
the right direction. His resolution marks a genuine
and much needed reform. The suppression of what
has been a public nuisance in the past will receive
commendatioin on all sides.
WITH this issue begins the series of home
studies The Call has arranged to publish for
the entertainment and instruction of its read
ers. The opening article by Professor Albert S.
Cook of Yale on "How to Study Shakespeare" will
be found in another column, and a second Shakes
pearean study will be published on Thursday from
the pen of Professor Parrot of Princeton. Thereafter
similar articles dealing with many of the more inter
esting of Shakespeare's works will appear in The
Call regularly every. Monday and Thursday during
the fall and winter until the course is completed.
The other courses, as has been announced, include
studies of the World's Great Artists, to be published
every Tuesday; Desk Studies for Girls and Shop
and Trade Studies "for Boys, on Wednesdays; Great
American Statesmen -on Fridays, and Home Science
and Household Economy on- Saturdays. Each of
these courses will be carried on by men and women
who rank as established authorities- on the subjects
with which they deal, and every article of the scries
will be from the pen of a competent expert.
Warm words of approval have been given to the
programme of study by 7 the foremost educators of
the State, and now that the publication of the series
has begun the reading public will be able to judge
for themselves of the merit of the undertaking. We
commend the article of this morning particularly to
the attention of our readers, in order that they may
start the series with the first paper and learn at the
outset how to study Shakespeare and what to look
for in his works.
It must be borne in mind that while the papers
will prove interesting even to the casual and in
different reader, their full value will be obtained only
by those who read them with care and studious at
tention. They are contributed by men and women
to whom education is a life work and have been
written with an earnest purpose. Those who arc
best acquainted with Shakespeare in a general way
can learn something in addition to what they already
know by reading what a critic of such eminence as
Professor Cook has to say about the proper study of
the great master's treatment of the problems of life.
SCHOOL BOARD SCANDALS.
SUFFICIENT evidence of fraudulent transac
tions on the part of certain members of the
School Board has been made public by The
Call to justify the belief that if the Grand Jury do its
full duty without fear or favor the people may have
the satisfaction of seeing some of the plunderers and
spoliators of the school funds indicted, prosecuted
and punished.
It is hardly worth while to go over again the dis
graceful record of jobbery and corruption The Call
has from time to time disclosed. Enough was pub
lished yesterday to make it evident that the Grand
Jury must act vigorously in the matter or rest itself
under suspicion of neglect of duty, or worse.
There is no department of local administration in
which fraud works a greater wrong to the com
munity than in that of the public schools. When the
money paid by the people for the education of their
children is wasted either by robbery or by extrav
agance, then it follows of necessity that school build
ings are neglected, needed repairs are not made, the
rooms are overcrowded or badly ventilated, danger of
disease threatens the children who gather there, the
teaching force suffers from lack of salaries, the
proper equipments of the schools are not supplied,
and in many other ways evils are inflicted upon a
very large proportion of the community. -
The late Grand Jury declared in its final report that
a moral certainty existed of fraud in the former
School Board, but that it could obtain no legal evi
dence sufficient to convict the presumably guilty par
ties. It is to be hoped the present jury will have
better success. Where wrongdoing has been carried
on to the extent The Call has exposed,' there must
be some way of bringing to light proofs of it" that
will bring about conviction in the courts. The people
therefore look to the Grand Jury with expectation,
and something must be done.
Admiral Dewey appears to have valued more the

STATE MINERS' CONVENTION.
SOME OF ITS BIG PROBLEMS
The biggest and most important State
convention in the history of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association will open in
San Francisco on the 23d inst., a week
from to-day, and for several days will be
the chief thing of interest in the coast
mining field. Secretary E. H. Benjamin's
voluminous correspondence concerning it
indicates that there will be several hun
dred delegates present.
The sixteen local associations, includ
ing that of Southern California,
have nearly all held conventions
and elected their quota of dele
gates during the past two weeks,
and at these conventions special interest
in the industry and in the convention has
been shown. The delegates are leading
and active mining men, and the conven
tion will be representative of the best in
tellect and character in the California
mining field. The convention will declare
the wants and policies of the State's
great mining population, united for the
general good of the Industry, and Its dec
larations and demands will have a pres
tige before Legislatures and public opinion
that few voluntary associations can com
mand.
This convention will have a wider scope
than any of its predecessors, and the suc
cess of the executive committee in secur
ing the co-operation of other Pacific Coast
States in making it representative of the
entire Western mining field will give it
an importance'equal to that of the Trans-
Mississippi congresses. The Governors of
'Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho and Wash
ington had last week reported the ap
pointment of 10 delegates each, and all
the other "Western Governors will un
doubtedly respond in time. Each execu
tive was asked to name representative
men who would really attend the conven
tion, and it is hoped that there will be
many delegates from sister States who
will later be active at home in promoting
the policies agreed upon.
It has been sought to make the conven
tion an interstate affair, because the ques
tions which will be made of chief Im
portance affect the industry in one West
ern State as much as in another, i These
are the revision of the Federal mining
law and the conservation of â¢ water. The
Federal mining law of 1572 and the court
decisions and departmental rulings that
have been hung to it have kept sporadic
demands for revision going for years
among mining men. The California Min
ers' Association resolved in favor of the
revision and codification of the Federal
mining and land laws early in its history,
and has appointed committees thereon,
but never until now taken up the matter
as one of chief importance. A wide field
for warm debate will be opened, and the
friends and enemies of the apex law may
have another inning, but whatever may
or may not be agreed upon, the discus
sion here and the efforts that will follow
may result in some further legislation by
Congress.
The discussion of the conservation of
water will come at an opportune time
when conventions and societies are at last
starting a definite aggressive effort to
save to the arid West its greatest treas
ureâthe water that it so royally wastes.
The convention should do much to further
awaken the mining interests to what the
problem means to the Industry and to add
another effective force to the efforts to
secure the storage of flood waters and
their distribution through mountains and
plains. The big gold mills that are
now again silent along the mother
lode region of the Sierra Nevadas
and elsewhere and the monitors that are
waiting for the rains are vivid evidences
of the California miner's interest in the
conservation of water. The taking up of
the question in this active way Is another
evidence of the value of this big organi
zation and an encouragement to those
who are working on the problem in other
fields.
Other important matters will come be
fore the convention. The California
Miners' Association maintains, the im
portant purpose of securing further Con
gressional appropriations for restraining
dams and the improvement of the navig
able rivers of the State, but as the Fed
eral engineers composing the California
Debris Commission have not yet been
able to get up a report on how the $500.
--000 already appropriated should be spent,
the convention will not be apt to do much
about dams this year. The mineral lands
issue is not dead and will get attention.
State mining legislation will be one im
portant topic. Steps will probably be
taken through resolutions and committees
to prepare a satisfactory State mining
law to take the place of the one supposed
to have been repealed by the last Legis
lature. The convention will undoubtedly
result in the organization of new county
associations and in otherwise increasing
the membership and nower of the fede
rated organisation, which now counts
about 9000 members. The Paris mining
exhibit will be among other local topics
considered.
The convention will assemble amid new
life and boom in the mining field and will
reflect that revival in its vim and good
will. The election of officers promises to

Mining in the Salmon River section dur
ing the coming year promises to be more
extensively carried on than ever before,
especially if we have a good winter in the
way of snow and rain, says the Yreka
Journal. At present, owing to the last
dry winter, water is very scarce and sev
eral quartz mines, as well as placer
1 claims, have been shut down in working.
I All along the Salmon River and tribu
taries, clear up into the Cecilville, Know I
Nothing Creek, Methodist Creek, Coffee
Creek and other districts adjacent to the
Trinity County border, rich mines exist
that only need plenty of water for getting
gold in immense quantities.
The investments in mining property in
the Gazelle district is becoming quite ex
tensive, and with thorough development
may prove to be one of the richest min
ing sections on the coast. This locality
abounds in immense ledges of quartz con
taining gold, silver and copper, not sup
posed heretofore to be rich enough for
working. It would be a good locality for
smelting works, as the vast area of quartz
ledges seems to be unlimited in extent.â

The mines known as the Keystone Con
solidated, at Amador City, are in a fair

! both of which have yielded much wealth
to their owners, the former about $15,

Everywhere throughout Calaveras
County there is a pronounced revival in

| war-vessel construction, is located along
j the River Oder and has an area of C 2
acres with a water front of 1756 feet. The
yard contains seven building slips, two of
i which will allow vessels of 700 feet in
: length. Each slip has its plant of tools,
| which, although expensive in first cost,
saves much time subsequently.
Next. April naval maneuvers will be held
on the largest scale yet attempted in
Japan. About 160 veseels will participate,
including the two new battleships Hat
suse and Shikishima. The Emperor will
be in command, and the programme will
be carried out as though the vessles were
actually engaging an enemy. It is ex
pected that all the foreign squadrons in
Far Eastern waters will assemble to wit
ness the maneuvers.
The erroneous idea seems to prevail in
this country that the good gunnery ex
hibited during the recent war with Spain
was due to the fact to much attention
ami large expenditures in our navy on
this very important object. According to
the statement made in a recent issue of
the Army and Navy Journal of New Tone
the total cost of the naval ammunition
expended during the Spanish-American
war was not one-fifth as great as the
amount expended annually in the British
navy in practice. It cost $45,000 in shells
and powder to destroy the Spanish squad
ron in Manila Bay, being at the rate of
$S 50 per round, and the running fight of
Santiago cost only about $100,000, or at the
rate of $14 25 per round.
The largest drydock in Germany is be
ing built at Bremerhaven. It is 722 feet
in length, 92 feet in width at entrance and
will have nearly 33 feet of water over the
sill at high tide, making it possible to
dock a ship of the greatest draught at
any stage of water. It is constructed of
concrete and brick and will cost about
$1,500,000, toward which the Government
contributes $600,000, for which it secures
the usual right under such conditions of
; utilizing the dock for war, vessels in the
I event of war or pressing necessity. The
! city of Bremen contributes $900,000 toward
j the new dock and a steamship company
has made arrangements for docking its
steamers, which will , Insure an annual
interest of 5 per cent upon the outlay by
the city. '-
The policy of the Italian Government is
j very liberal toward contractors for naval
i vessels. In 1595 the Ansaldo Company at
Sestri Ponente, near Naples, obtained the
| contract for an armored cruiser to be
| called the Garibaldi. When the ship was
launched the contractors received an of-
I fer from the Argentine Republic, and with
j the Italian Government's approval the
j ship was sold to the South American re
i public, where she is now under the
original name. A second Garibaldi was
j likewise disposed of to Spain, and named
the Christobal Colonâ a name not un
! familiar, to the people of the United
j States. The third Garibaldi was turned
! over to the Argentine Republic and nam
ed the Puerridon, and the fourth Gari
baldi, ostensibly building for the Italian
navy, may likewise be disposed of. She
was begun in September, 1898, and launch
-led in nine months. The ship is an im
provement on her predecessors, being 7393
tons, 13,500 horse-power, and twenty knots
speed. The armor is 6-inch nickel steel
and the battery is composed of one 10
--inch, two 8-inch quick-firers and fourteen
6-Inch quick-firers. The contract cost of
the first Garibaldi was $3,400,000, but the
action of the Italian Navy Department,
due chiefly to the chronic state
of impecuniousness, has enabled the
contractors to turn the sum four
times over and thus distribute
$13,600,000 among the workmen of Italy.
Orlando Bros., at Leghorn, have re
ceived similar favors, for of three vessels
bearing the name of Varesa, two have
gone to the Argentine Republic, where
they are known as the San Martin and
the General Belgrano, and the third
Varesa may follow its sister ships or be
taken by the Italian Government.
The French Mediterranean squadron re
cently had some target tiring with large

which the ships moved, nor of the char
acter of the target, but the records of in

SCOPE OF EXAMINER'S SENSE
L'ltalia, the Italian newspaper pub
lished in this city, resents in most vigor
ous style the insult to its people published
by the Examiner recently. The Call, it
appears, invoked the aid of Signor Mar
coni's most marvelous invention to re
port the international yacht race. To be
little the enterprise of its rival the Ex
aminer sneers at wireless telegraphy as
a silly fad, and calls its Inventor Signor
Macaroni. This is about the full scope
of Examiner wit and sense. L'ltalia very
truthfully says that these guttersnipe in
surers of Marconi would do well to re
member that it was the genius of the
Italian, Flavio Gioia, which gave to
navigation the mariner's compass; physi
cal sciences owe to Torricelli the inven
tion-of the barometer. Volta and Galvani
discovered electricity, and Columbus dis
covered America. This last discovery
was not an unmixed blessing, however,
for it made the Examiner possible.â

l [LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM NO. 26,785]
" Dear Mrs. Pinkuam â I have many,
many thanks to give you for what your
Vegetable Compound has done for me.
After first confinement I was sick for
nine years with prolapsus of the womb,
had pain in left Bide, in small of back,
a great deal of headache, palpitation
of heart and leucorrhoea. I felt so
weak and tired that I could not do my
work. I became pregnant again and
took your Compound all through, and
now have a sweet baby girl. I never
before had such an easy time during
labor, and I feel it was due to I^dia
E. Pinkhams Vegetable Compound. I
am now able to do my work and feel
better than I have for years. I cannot
thank you enough.?â -Mbs. Ed. Eh-

Wonderfully Strengthened.
"I have been taking Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, Blood
Purifier and Liver Pills and feel won-
derfully strengthened. Before using
your remedies I was in a terrible state;
felt like fainting every little while. I
thought I must surely die. But now,
thanks to your remedies, those feel-

SIMPLE TRIBUTE TO THE
MEMORY OF WILL SNOW
SERVICES In memory of Will A Snow, late marine reporter on the Chron
icle, who lost his life on the night of Thursday, October 10. by falling
into the bay from a launch, were held yesterday afternoon at the rooms
of the Press Club on Ellis street More than a hundred friends and fel
low-workers of the dead Journalist gathered to testify their sorrow at
his untimely taking off. There was nothing elaborate about the exercises.
They were sinjple testimonial of friends to the worth of the dead man.
James P. Booth, president of the club, took charge of the proceedings and
introduced those who lent their aid to tho occasion. A song, "Still, Still With
Thee," by the Press Club quartet, was first, and then Ernest S. Simpson, city
editor of the Chronicle, spoke briefly and feelingly of the deceased.
"It is not my place to attempt any eulogy," he said, "but to testify to the
appreciation in which Snow was held and how he was esteemed by those for
whom and with whom he worked; how we knew of the courage and of the
faithful, sympathetic, unassuming nature of the man, and to say that It has
been a revelation to us that so many others knew him as we knew him. From
all walks of life comes testimony to the integrity and worth of the man and
his fine honorâ from all along the water front, on which he worked, from the
military camps, from the soldiers, from all with whom he came in contact. We
did not Imagine that so many had found out the man as we knew him. It
was a revelation to us. selfish as we were in the belief that only we appreciated
him. We remember too well the shock and horror of that night of his death;
the quivering lips, the whitened faces, the shaking voices of those who came
to tell what had happened out there In the dark and storm. We hope and pray
that the sea may give back Its dead, that we may send it to the mother who
weeps and waits ln far away Kansas.
"We know not what there may be in the valley beyond the shadows, but
we believe and we know that among the souls of the men who have died for
duty's sake, clear and fair and white as any in that company shines the soul
of brave Will Snow. God rest him."
Homer Henley sang "Calvary," and after him came Merton C. Allen of
the Chronicle, who spoke of the dead man as he had been among his fellows;
of his genial manners and his sterling worth. He told of the bright future
that lay before the man so suddenly taken off. and he referred to the life of
the deceased as one worthy to be an example to those who sorrowed for him.
He had but gone, said Mr. Allen, to that better land, the portal of which men
call death.
Andrew Y. Wood followed with a solo. "Sion," and A. J. Waterhouse read
a poem written in tribute to tho worth of the deceased. "Come Unto Me" was
rendered by the quartet, and Dwight L. Potter of Oakland, who had been at
college with Snow ln Kansas, spoke for the relatives of the dead man. In
their name he thanked the friends who had gathered and who had shown such
kindly and ready sympathy, and then he repeated a prayer for the departed
soul, while those In the entertainment hall of the Press Club, a place unused
to such invocations, bowed their heads and followed him reverently.
General Funston and Vernon Kellogg of Stanford University were among
those who attended the memorial. Both were friends and fellow-collegians
with Snow.
The father of the dead Journalist will arrive at San Francisco to-day.

RICH CLAIMS
AT CAPE NOME
Lieutenant Bennett Is
Home Again.
Lieutenant G. W. Bennett, a well
known former police officer of this city,
returned to liis home Saturday on the
ship Carrie and Annie after an absence
of two years in the gold fields of Alaska,
Lieutenant Bennett, who was one of
the most popular members of the force
and who served in its ranks for more
than twenty years, left for the Klondike
two years ago hoping to restore his
broken health by the long sea voyage.
He returns much better physically, al
though his left arm Is still partially par
alyzed from his former sickness. He has
been far more fortunate, however, than
many of those who have sought wealth
in the north.
Bennett yesterday recounted some of
his adventures to friends who stopped
him at every step he took from his home
at 814 lowa street. Every one in the Po
trero knows Lieutenant Bennett and they
were all anxious to say a cordial word of
greeting. He left for Alaska on the
Mayor Bidwell. a steamer owned by the
Independent Mining Company, of which
he is a member. A storm carried the ves
sel beyond St. Michael and threw them
right into the rich Nome district. Land
ing at Golovin Bay they were the second
party to strike these rich fields. The
company has located in this district alter
a year's prospecting some sixty-five rich
claims.
Lieutenant Bennett tells some startling
tales of hazardous escapes from death.
On one occasion the little steamer be
longing to the party battled with the
waves for eighteen hours, trying to keep
off a rocky shore. Another time the lieu
tenant and two companions, while sled
ding provisions over a frozen river, were
blown nearly a mile by a fierce hurricane
to what peemed certain death. Another
disagreeable incident occurred in en
deavoring to secure water, which can
only be obtained by melting ice. The party
was horrified on one occasion to find that
they had swallowed frozen pieces from a
dead Eskimo,
Among these in the party were Adoiph
Peterson, Charles Jewel, August Schultz,
Charles Ryoell, Henry Gumm, Peter Ben
son, Fred Olson, John Sandel, Morris
Enright, e Mike McDonald and Charles
Nelson.
Lieutenant Bennett expects to return to
his claims in a few months.

BAD Ml FROM
TEXAS GOES ON
THE WARPATH
Mendenhall Tries to
Kill Castro.
William Mendenhall. an ex-sergeant in
the Twenty-fourth Infantry, attempted
yesterday afternoon to murder John Cas
tro, a saloon-keeper at 311 Pacific street.
It was by the merest chance that he did
not succeed.
Mendenhall is half-Indian and half-ne
gro, and boasts that he is "the gamest
| black beast that ever walked." He had
been haunting Castro's saloon for some
I months, having become Infatuated with
I a woman who frequented it. About three
months ago he was arrested for disturb
: ing the peace, caused by his fancy for the
woman, and on more than one occasion
since then he has caused a disturbance
in the neighborhood.
Early yesterday morning Mendenhall
was in the saloon and got so noisy that
he was thrown out. The woman had sent
him a note asking him to call, and be
cause the saloon-keeper refused to allow
him to see her he got angry and threat
ened to demolish the place.
Yesterday afternoon Mendenhall got
filled up with Barbary Coast whisky
, and purchased a revolver. He went to
Castro's saloon, determined to wreak
j vengeance on the man who had come be
tween him and the woman. Castro was
! standing in front of the bar, and as Men
! denhall opened the saloon door they were
! close to each other. Mendenhall pulled
, the revolver out of his pocket, and with
; out saying a word fired a shot at '"astro
The bullet grazed the saloon man's ear. i
and so close was the revolver to him that !
his ear was powder marked. The bullet i
struck an oak frame surrounding a pic
ture of "William Jennings Bryan, the apos- .
, tle of free silver, and lodged In the wall.
| There were some friends of Castro in
the saloon at the time, and before Men
denhall could fire again they rushed upon
him, and after disarming him gave him
|an unmerciful beating. Sergeant Chris
tiansen and some officers were apprised
of the shootinc: and were on the scene in
j time to save Mendenhall's life. He was
taken to the Harbor Hospital.- where cuts
' under his eyes and on his nose and face
were dressed. He was taken to the City ,
Prison, where a charge of assault to com*- ;'
! mit murder was booked against him. 'â â 
â  Judge Mogan happened to be In the prison '
at the time, and Mendenhall made it plain
! to his Honor that he came from Cleve- j
land, Tex., and, was a bad man to fool
; with.

1. HOW TO STUDY SHAKESPEARE
Let us suppose that one Is approaching
Shakespeare for the first time. If he feels
himself at a loss to know what to do be
yond reading each play through, it ls be
cause he does not know what to look for.
For that ls what study is. It is a looking
for something and an endeavor to ascer
tain when one has found it. In arithmetic
and algebra lt is a looking for the answer
to a problem, or rather for the processes
leading to the discovery of the answer.
In history it is a looking for the causes
which have made individuals or nations
great, and the reasons for their decline or
overthrow. In chemistry it is a looking
SHAKESPEARE, From the Stratford Portrait.
The pretentious painting known as the Stratford portrait and presented ln 1867 by
W. O. Hunt, town clerk of Stratford, to the Birthplace museum, where it ls
very prominently displayed, was probably painted from the bust in the Strat
ford church late in the eighteenth century.
for the elements of which a body is com
posed and the proportions In which those
elements enter into the constitution of the
body. In psychology it is a looking for
the traits which go to make up human
nature. In painting it is a looking for the
secrets of color, of beautiful line, of at
mosphere, of composition, of tone. As all
study is a search, the question of how to
study Shakespeare is best approached
through the question, What shall we look
for in Shakespeare?
I shall of course not attempt to enum
erate all the things which one may rea
onably hope to find in the dramas, which,
by common consent, stand at the summit
of English literature, if not of the
world's, but shall content myself with
mentioning a few of the more obvious, if
at the same time they represent funda
mental aspects of the poet's work and are
profitable subjects for prolonged consid
eration.
1. It is related by St. Augustine that,
! upon the recitation in the theater of the
famous line of Terence, "I am a man. and
I I consider naught that Is human beneath
my regard," the whole audience. broke out
into thunderous acclamation. Shakes
peare might have adopted the line as his
motto. Beyond any other writer he has
exemplified Pope's sentiment, "The proper
study of mankind is man." He was
a hero-worshiper when hero-worship
was possible; when he could not
approve, he yet loved; and when
he could not love, he scrutinized, he an
alyzed, he revealed. The Individual soul
lis to him infinitely attractive, nay. en
! grossing; he is appreciative of Its virtues
and aspirations, tolerant of Its foibles
and amused by its harmless or delightful
eccentricities: he sounds Its deepest pas
sions, comprehends the mainsprings of
its activity, and. while watching how it
is Impelled by desire or precipitated by
circumstance toward an Inescapable fu
ture, he is touched by its pathos and its
tragedy or exults in Its attainment and
Its joy. Partake Shakespeare's delight in
life, and in the play of life upon life, if
you would derive impulse and Instruction
from the vast spectacle of man, if you
would find a village rife with momentous
mystery, and make the circle of your ac
! quaintance a theater replete with the cv
! rious and the wonderful. Begin this study
lin any play of Shakespeare. Count up
its distinct characters: note their indi
vidual traits; see to what types they sev
erally belong and to what classes of so
ciety: observe how they behave in dif
ferent situations and how they react one
upon another; and discover how far they
resemble the men and women that you
know or that you have read about. When
you have done this with half a dozen
dramas try to form some conception of
the range of interests, the closeness of
observation and the quickness and versa
tility of sympathy of the man who could
imagine and create this world of human
beings. You will thus have begun to
study Shakespeare, and perhaps to find a
new meaning in the world about you.
2. Notwithstanding Shakespeare's ab
sorption in the individual soul, notwith
standing his sympathetic interpretation
of the beggar, the serving man, the thief,
the drunkard, or the monster lower than
manâ if any monster can be lower than
degraded manâ yet he Is never at a loss
to exhibit a scale of values for his per
sonages. They are not equal In spiritual
rank, and he never pretends they are. We
feel with Caliban, as more righteous be
ing than ourselves would feel with In
dians and other barbarians, when he says:
â¢''.'â  vii- When thou earnest first 'Â£-,yl7i
Thou strokest mÂ« and made much of me;
wouldst give me 7"7.77-7j-:
Water with berries in 't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less.
That burn by day and night, and then I loved
thee.
And showed thee all tho qualities o' the Isle*-
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and
fertile â
Cursed be I that did sol All the charms
Of Sycorax. toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have.
Which first was mine own king, and here you
sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you __â  keep from me
The rest o' tne island.
Yet though we resent the apparent in
justice which he suffers, we never suppose
him to be the peer of Miranda or Phospero.
We may make merry with Falstaff and
find his wit, his roguery and resource in
finitely diverting, yet Shakespeare con
vinces us of his essential vileness and fu
tility, and even causes us in some measure
to despise ourselves for our laughing con
donation of his vices, when Prince Hal,
now king indeed, touches him as with
the spear of Ithuriel and causes him to
appear in his true aspect ("2 Hen. 1V.,"
V., v., 51-74.).
3. Shakespeare has the greatest respect
for the civic virtues, for those which hold
together the framework of society. It fol
lows that he brands with his abhorrence
all treachery, disloyalty and Ingratitude,
all ruthless and insolent tyranny, and all
deliberate failure to co-operate In the ad
vancement of the common weal. Almost
very one of the more serious plays and
even some of the comedies, will furnish
; instances in proof. In "King Lear" he
stigmatizes filial ingratitude; in "Mac
beth," regicide and oppression; In "The
Tempest," treason; and these are but
specimens. Now and again the whole
tempest of bis eloquence is poured out in
a flood on the unsocial vices, on lawless
ness, anarchy and riot.
4. While It is thus true that Shake
speare has for his characters a scale of
values and recognizes a pantheon of vir
tues, it must be said, on the other hand,
that there is an excellence for which he
has but scant and conventional appre
ciation. I refer to the virtue which has
primary reference to God, as those al
ready mentioned have to man or the state.
Though he can at times manifest tender
ness and reverence in his allusions to
sacred things (as c. g.. "1 Hen. 1V.," 1.,
1., 18-27; "Hamlet." I . i.. 158-134; "All's
Well," 11., i.. 139-144). yet for reverence,
for worship, for holiness of life, he in
general has but slight regard. The ami
able friar In "Romeo and Juliet" by no
means Inspires unqualified reverence; the
ambitious Gloucester, not yet become
King. Richard 111., is willingly supported
! in his young hypocrisy by two bishops,
and the saintly seeming Angelo in "Meas
use for Measure" has but stolen the livery
of the court of heaven to serve the devil
in. Shakespeare came between the earlier
ages of faith, with their exaltation of re
ligion, and the puritanism of the seven
; teenth century. He finds the Middle Ages
j picturesque and despises the puritans; he
| himself In a child of the Renaissance, and
his kingdom Is a kingdom of this world.
5. While Shakespeare's prime interest
is in humanity, he yet has an open eye
for the terror, the majesty and the beauty
of the physical universe, and for the
aspect of all things visible. Take but two
illustrationsâ the one of the sun ("Richard
II.," 111., 11., 41-2. when
From under the terrestlal ball
Ho fires the proud tops of the eastern pines;
the other of the winds ("2 Hen. IV. 11l
i., 22-4): .
Who take the ruffian billows by the tops.
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging
them
With deafening clamor In the slippery clouds;
I or. If you wish another, add the picture of
j a navy afloat ("Henry V.," 111., prol.
7-16). But in any case note how he per
! sonifiesâ he makes nature alive with
j man. j 7- :
6. Shakespeare has definite views con
[ cerning poetry. its nature and processes.
Thus he proclaims the office of poetry to
soften and refine ("Two Gentlemen of
| Verona." 111.. 11., 72 ff.): .-777
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets'
sinews 777 ';â '-â¢ 77:7V- â â T.v..: 7
Whose golden touch could soften steel and
stones.
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
Again, he tells us what Is the poet's
master faculty ("Midsummer Night's
Dream," V., 1., 12-17):
The poet's eye. In a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth
to heaven; ~v.-V.-v7
And, as Imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
'a local habitation and a nam*-
He affirms a deep and hard truth ("As
You Like It," 111., iii., 19): "The truest
poetry is the most feigning." He per
ceives that art may surpass nature
("Venus and Adonis,". 289 ff.):
Look when a painter would surpass the life.
In limning out a well-proportioned steed,
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
As if the dead the living should exceed;
So did this horse excel a common one
In shape, in courage, color, pace and bone.
And in the perplexed question concerning
the relative superiority of art and nature
he gives an illuminative decision ("Win
ter's Tale," IV., iv., 89 ff.):
Made better by no means,
But nature makes that mean: so over that art
Which you say adds to nature is an art
That nature makes.
There is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art Itself Is nature.
Finally, when he speaks of "the elegancy,
facility and golden cadence of poesy," he
has at once named the trait by which the
unlettered most readily recognize it, and
the quantity of which the greatest mas
ters are the quickest to appreciate "the
charm, Shakespeare studied nature, but
he labored at an art; and the measure of
his success in touching the hearts of men
Is the perfection which his art attained.
So we may, if we will begin by looking
in Shakespeare for these six things. We
may see how he loves, and studies, and
reveals man in brutesâ the human soul In
a human bodyâ in a word which thwarts,
perplexes, amuses or inspires him, and
amid other human beings from whom he
is strikingly dissimilar, and with whom
he is essentialy akin. Then we may ob
serve how Shakespeare never persistently
and ultimately misleads us, but always
gives us ample materials for deciding
upon the true moral rank of each of his
important characters. We may perceive
how he is interested to uphold the moral
order of the world, as revealed In social
and political institutions, and how he
lashes those who are guilty of any at
tempt to subvert this moral order, while
he bestows honors with a lavish hand
upon those who are concerned in main
taining It. We shall then discover, on
closer inspection, that the dramatist has
but slight sympathy with other worldli
ness, with the spirit that, regarding man
as a stranger and pilgrim on the earth,
deliberately sets its affection on things
above. Next, we may follow his pencil
as, with vigorous or tender touches, it
paints for us the appearance and effects
of objects in the world of sense, rarely
giving us an object alone, but associating
them in groups, or uniting them by recip
rocal action and influence, as he does
with his human beings. hen we have
begun all this, we may at length study
Shakespeare's views concerning the won
derful art by which he was enabled to
perform these marvels, and investigate
the means by which they were actually
brought to pass.

championship regatta of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union.
The surprises ot the day were supplied
by Stanley Addcrley, Triton Boating

crew. Adderley, after being coaxed
against his inclination to enter the junior
skiff race, proved an easy winner, while
the South End junior barge crew, atter
being picked as sure winners by the
knowing ones, failed to finish. The only
mishap of the day occurred to George
F. McGrill of the South Ends in the
junior shell race, which was Brst on the
gramme. While being conveyed to El
Carnpo on the ferry-boat his shell was
Btepped on and injured: On being â 7 wed

game was as hotly contested as If there

"Johnny" Schorr was quite a prominent
rider some four years back, being able to
hold his own with the best of the Middle

noted rider, is under contract with Schorr
& Son, but upon the jockey's arrival here
that firm will relinquish all claim to him,
Burns & Waterhouse having first call dur

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1899.
SCULLERS AND BARGEMEN RACE IN EL CAMPO WATERS.
The second annual championship regatta of the Pacific Association of the Amateur Athletic Union was held yesterday at El
Camp. i. Alexander Pape again proved his superiority with the sculls, defeating Dr. Dennis and George Baker in a decisive
manner. The senior barge crew of the Alameda Boat Club won the senior championship for the second year. The day was all
that could be desired for aouatlc sport, but the attendance was not .in keeping with the occasion.
NORA ROMPS
THROUGH THE
CENTENNIAL
T. J. Mclnemey's Greyhounds
Win Both Stakes at Union
Coursing Park.
Three greyhounds from the kennels of
T. J. Mclnerney of Merced carried off all
the honors and $315 ln prize money at
Union Coursing Park yesterday. It was
the one-hundredth day's coursing at the
park and to commemorate the occasion a
special programme had been prepared. A .
stake known as the "Centennial" was the i
choice bit of the offerings and attracted
the highest class dogs on the coast to the I
number of thirty-two. It was won by j
Mclnemey's Nora.
The stake was run under the best possi
ble conditions. The hares were strong,
the field as smooth as velvet, while in the
air there was a trace of autumn crispness
that added zest to the sport. The outcome
was In doubt until the end. One by one
warm favorites dropped out. leaving the
bettors all at sea. Royal Flush was a warm
favorite, but he was drawn after two
courses. He was suffering from a cold
and did not run true to form. Luxor
seemed invincible until he met Lady Em
ma, which led him to the hare and finally
defeated him by a score of 14 points to S.
The chances of Bohe and Whitehead
were ruined in the second round when it
required three trials before either could be
declared the winner. The scores were 3â3,
7â7 and the decisive one Bâ4 in favor of
Bohe. Whitehead seemed in the better
condition, but the hard work told on him.
He Is a big, loosely put together young
greyhound, while Bohe Is compact, with
muscles like steel. She made but a poor
stand against Theron in the next round,
however, going out by a score of 5 to 3.
Lucky Dog, which is possessed of great
speed, made no showing against Luxor
once the latter passed him. The score
was 13 to 1.
The last course was run at dusk, when
the color of the hare seemed merged with
that of the ground. It was easy to sep
arate the dogs, as Nora Is as black as
night while Thornhill is white with some
slight brindle markings. Nora led from
the slips and had a commanding lead
throughout, although Thornhill was In for
a brief spell. Nora ran up a score of 8
point? to 4 for the Cronin dog.
The reserve stake provided sport in
keeping with that shown by the dogs in
the champion class. The Mclnerney rep
resentatives, Regina R and Johnny it,
worked their way into the final and di
vided first and second money. Lavender
again covered herself with glory and the
"Hoot Mon" admirers were In eestacy
over her performances. She beat McKin
ley 6 5, Sara 6âB, Beacon 14 9, and was
finally defeated by Regina by a score of
15â11, which shows that in the language
of the field she is "sticky."
O X Capitol beat Statesman 3â2. From
the stand It was claimed Statesman
seemed to have the. better of the course.
Judge Grace said he was not on the hare
and was not entitled to the points the am
ateur judges thought should be awarded
him. The results In detail follow:

A Day's Sensational Coursing
The two stakes at Union Park yesterday
at its "centennial" or one-hundredth
meeting attracted an immense attendance.
The sport throughout the day was excit
inlg, the result in every course being,
seemingly. in doubt. T. J. Mclnerney won
both stakes, while a third of his repre
sentatives finished second.
Inerney's Regina and Johnny R divided
first and second money.
Coursing at Inglesidt
Mamie Pleasant won the open stake at
Ingleside yesterday and her full sister,
I St. Helen, was runner-up. Both bitches
i are owned by Connell Bros., and they
were certainly entitled to the stake for
j the fine condition in which they sent
: their entries to the slips. The coursing
throughout the day was good and the
betting lively. The hottest thing handed
1 to the "pikers" all day was at the closing
j part of the programme, when St. Oran
met Jessamy in a bye and won on the
; short end at odds of live to one. Jessamy
delayed the sport as usual after the course
! by refusing to be caught by her owner.
If she cannot be broken of her fits of the
i sulks her entry should be refused by the
j field stewards, as her performance of yes
; terday was certainly an imposition on the
spectators. The results of the day were
'as follows: "â¢â¢â â : .-' â â â 7. *â  * : â¢â¢: â -â  :,. ..V-

DUDES AND
LOBSTERS IN
TORRID BALL
Ten Innings Are Necessary to
Settle the Gam? at Ree-
reation Park.
Oakland 4, Santa Cruz 3.
Ten innings were necessary to decide
the game yesterday afternoon between the
Dudes and Lobsters, and for the second
time in a single day the Dudes consumed
the crustaceans in every variety of
preparation. The game developed a new
twirler. Babbitt, perhaps the best Santa
Cruz has within Its ranks. In the third
inning he replaced Whelan and not 8
hit was made off his delivery. This con
joined with the fact that he pitched six
Innings of the morning game in Oakland is
a remarkable record.
At the outset of the game it looked like
a genuine walk over the entire earth for
the fancy dressers from across the bay.
Hutchinson jogged to the first bag and
was presented with second on a wild
throw. A soft gentle bunt by Hammond
gave Hutchinson another base and him
self a safe resting at first. Then Mr.
Donovan placed the ball ln Devereaux's
hands and the latter threw home to end
the existence of Hutchinson, but the ball
struck Hutch In the back and he was
safe on the rubber. All this time Ham
mond kept a-moving round the bags and
scored, tollowed across the plate soon
after by Donovan, who made the best or
Dunleavy's single. These three runs were
all Oakland had marked against its name
on the score board until the tenth inning.
In the fourth inning Moskiman was pre
sented with a large and bushy bunch of
vehow chrysanthemums and the boys in
the bleachers began singing "Because She
Loves Him." This was tor Moskiman s
home run in the morning. After the pre
sentation, the Oakland fielder was not
himself, all his hits being sent toward
heaven, where his head rested for the
nonce. 'The bunch acted as a Lobster
mascot for Drennan when he stepped to
the bat in the fourth and drove the ball
to Schmeer, who threw over first and
into the crowd. The crowd clung to the
ball and Drennan rounded the bases. The
fifth inning brought two runs to Santa
Cruz. Dalrvmple went to first on a throw
of Lange's" over Hutch's reach and a
two base hit by Morrow sent him to
third. Andrews bunted and both Dal
rvmple and Morrow scored.
With three runs apiece the game ad
vanced to the usual limit without a scor
ing by either side. Then came a wicked
error that gave Oakland the game.
Hutchinson went to first on a walk, was
forced to second on Hammond's sacrifice
and scored on a juggle of McCarthy,
who did not field a hot one that Hardie
sent into his hands. The game ended here
with the winners at the bat. but one man
having perished. The score is:

nine hits being their portion. Oakland
registered thirteen of them and that
is what won the game.
Each team scored . a run in the
first inning. Babbitt made first on

good time. The firemen found, however,
that no water could be obtained from any
reasonable distance, and they were com
pelled to take their engine "to the fire

Reihl Dies From His Wound.

September 11 fired a bullet through his
head at his mother's ranch near Alma,

INVESTIGATING LAUNDRIES.
Labor Commissioner Meyers Enters
Upon His Official Duties.
The first work the new Labor Commis
sioner, F. V Meyers, and Chief Deputy
Kelsey have undertaken is the investiga
tion of tho white laundries of this city.
Soon after they took ofiice complaints
were made that the employes of these
places were being worked unusually long
hours and at mall wages. The inquiry
has been carried on among the large laun
dries only, and the conditions under which
the employes labored were not all that
the officials could desire. They discovered
that in the mangle and ironing rooms
tho operatives are compelled to work
from 7 o'clock In the morning to 8 and 10
o'clock at night. The work is particu
larly hard and wages are not sufficient.
In some of the places the employers pay
from $10 to $12 per week .. and furnish
board. Where board Is not provided the
pay is about $20 per week. These figures
apply to the mangle room, where the
rough Ironing is done by means of ma
chinery, whicn dries and smooths out such
articles as tablecloths and sheets.
Thos>; who do the better class of Iron
ing receive from $-1 lo %_ a month more. In
the four or five laundries visited the op
eratives number about 100, and the ma
jority are girls and young women. The
Commissioner speaks very complimentary
of the nice, intelligent appearance of the
girls employed. Another cause for com
plaint is that the pay days are too far
apart. At some of the laundries payment
is ide monthly. and at a few the em
ployes receive their money every two
weeks. Considering the small amounts
received they state that it is necessary
that they should he paid oftener in order
to meet expenses. Commissioner Meyers
states that .â¢ring his investigation
he has not found any direct vio
lations of the law, but the condition of
the operatives could be greatly Improved;
He proposes to discuss the situation with
the employers and see if the hours can
be reduced a little and the work made
tasier.

NEW DEFINITION OF
RELIGION PROPOUNDED
REV. B. FAY MILLS AT FIRST
UNITARIAN CHURCH.
Declares It Is "That Fine Sense of
the Soul That Connects the In
dividual With Universal
Purpose."
Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills, who Is visit
ing this city, occupied the pulpit in the
First Unitarian Church yesterday morn
ing. Mr. Mills created quite a stir here
some seven years ago with his revival
meetings at the Mechanics' Pavilion. He
has since become a convert to Unitarian
ism and during the past two years has
been preaching to a large congregation in
the Hollis-street Theater in Boston. He
will remain in this city for two weeks and
next Sunday will be heard at the First
Unitarian Church in Oakland.
When asked whether he would accept
the call to the latter church Mr. Mills re
plied that it had not as yet been extended
to him. A friend of his In Boston, he said,
had had some correspondence on the sub
ject, but Mr. Mills had not considered it.
His subject yesterday was "A New Defi
nition of Religion," which he said an In
spired friend had recently given to him.
"Religion," said he, "is that fine sense
of the soul that connects the Individual
with universal purpose. That word 'pur
pose* is the greatest word in the land. No
thing is so despised as a seemingly pur
poseless life, and on the other hand life
is ennobled when it has some great pur
pose iii view. The foundation of every re
ligion without exception is based on some
great purpose. Even the Socialist and the
Anarchist is not so far away from re
ligion in his utterances when we consider
the redhot purpose of these social re
formers to put into practice what they re
gard best for the world's welfare and
what to them seems right.
"Every religion has experienced the
baptism of purpose and the more that
purpose is realized the truer will that re
ligion be. The great universal purpose of
the uplifting of humanity is a religion In
itself. We all have some connection with
the great eternal purpose of living a right
eous life and doing what is right as far as
we are able. It Is the universal purpose
to get a grip on the individual and en
noble his soul with a love for the Creator.
"It is not the name of religion that
counts, but the reality. The questions that
are fraught with wondrous importance
are: 'Is this a universe? ls there a pur
pose in it? Is that purpose universal?' We
should enroll ourselves in the one great
eternal harmony of dutiful purpose. There
is no limit to the possibilities if the defini
tion of religion be true and the religion be
practicable.
"I expect a new expression of religion
to-day aside from any article of faith
which may be prescribed by denomina
tions. We will make the choice of choices
if we believe in righteousness, in universal
purpose and the manifestation of God in
and through the goodness of the individ
ual life, and thereby we will attain the
perfection of religion."
STEVENSON BRINGS SUIT.
Wants an Accounting From the Bad- j
ger Mining Company Directors.
Stockholders and directors of the !
Badger Gold Mining and Milling Com
pany have decided to go to court and set
tle various and vast differences now ex
isting between them. Late Saturday
afternoon Attorney Louis P. Boardman,
on behalf of A. V. Stevenson, a stock
, bolder. filed suit against the corporation,
i A. B. Bennison, H. W. Mathews und J. J.
â  Mevers, constituting a majority of the
board of directors, and S. K. Bradford, G.
W. Dewitt, H. L. McClane and John
i Hughes, for an accounting of all moneys
paid out in salaries and other expenses
' of the mine. Including development and
: purchase of materials, and for all moneys
' that have been received by the corporation
from the proceeds of the various mines
operated under its direction.
It is alleged thai the defendants named,
constituting a majority of the board of
directors, have voted to pay excessive sal
aries to Dewitt and McClane, superin
tendents of the properties, and that they
have conspired together to create ficti
cious indebtedness and liability that the
profits of the corporation might be di
verted. Some thirty allegations of mis
conduct on the part of the defendants
are made by the plaintiff, .and when is
sues are joined a bitter legal battle is an
ticipated. Upon the filing of the com
plaint Mr. Boardman, on behalf of his
client, filed a bond in $10,000 for the ap
pointment of a receiver to take charge of
the properties, but a short time later the
defendants deposited a bond of $20,000 and
a receiver was not appointed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1899.
LEAPED EIGHTY
FEET AND MET
VIOLENT DEATH
Louis P. Crogan De
stroys Himself.
OAKLAND, Oct. IB.â Melancholia, su
perinduced by homesickness, is the sup
posed cause that impelled Louis P. Cro
gan, aged 17 years, to Jump, this evening,
from a roof story or fifth floor window, on
the south side of St. Mary's College to
j the campus, nearly eighty feet below,
j where his limp and almost lifeless body
I was picked up by several of the brothers
; and carried into one of the classrooms.
i Dr. I. E. Nicholson was Immediately sum-
I moned, but his services were not re
! quired. The young man's neck w-s
' broken, his backbone and many other
bones were shattered and he breathed out
a few moments.
The deceased came here on the Bth inst.
from his home ln Corbell, Humboldt
County, where his father ls a lumberman.
He registered at St. Mary's College, but
I did not announce what course of study he
! Intended to pursue, and his peculiarities
I were noted at the time by the various
brothers at the college. He would go
j about murmuring to himself Incoherently,
and Brother Walter was impressed with
the idea that Crogan was somewhat
mentally deranged. Later the young
man's condition became such that on the
recommendation of Dr. J. Maher he was
I placed on a comfortable cot in the in-
I firmary department ln the roof story of
I the college, where he had remained the
j past five days almost constantly In the
care of Lawrence Carroll, a trained
nurse.
Five days ago Brother Walter wrote to
, the parents advising them of their son's
i condition, and asking whether to send
; him home or what course should be taken,
but thus far no reply has been received.
Crogan complained of sleeplessness,
! and Dr. Maher frequently administered
bromide and other sleep-Inducing potions
to quiet his nerves. Shortly after 5
o'clock this evening Nurse Carroll stepped
out of the room to bring his ward supper.
j During his absence Crogan arose In his
! night robe, placed a chair near a window,
so as to enable him to open it, and then
â¢ jumped to his death.
Brother Walter has sent a telegram to
the parents, but Corbell is about ten miles
from a telegraph office or postoffice, and
some time wil elapse before they hear
I the news.
The remains have been removed to the
I morgue, and Coroner Mehrmann expects
' to hold the inquest next Tuesday.
HOME LIFE IS THE
NATIONS DEFENSE
Rev. F. B. Cherlngton^, pastor of Ply
mouth Congregational Church, took for
the subject of his sermon yesterday the
commandment "Honor thy father and thy
mother." Briefly, he said:
The fifth commandment establishes the
authority of the home. The family ls a
heaven-ordained institution. Its dignity,
sanctity and authority must be preserved,
if social and civil order endures. Plato,
prince of philosophers, and speaking from
the very summit of Greek culture in his
republic, has no place In his Ideal organ
ization for the house-life, as the Scriptures
understand it.
The family Is the unit of the state: the
hearthstone Is the cornerstone of the
temple, the foundation stone of govern
ment, the keystone of social order. As a
nation's homes are, so Is the nation.
The homes of our colonial days produced
the men of blood and Iron who successfully
fought our Revolutionary battles; who with
high souls attuned to every noble principle
framed the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution. Honor of parents,
reverence for parental authority, loving loy
alty to all the home Interests, must pre
cede all other virtues that make commercial
1 life honest while it Is aggressive; social life
pure while It Is progressive; civil life just
while it is strong.
The home training is the most important
that influences the life of the individual.
Here all the germ virtues are planted that
In the mature years unfold In all the
flower and fruitage of a noble life. Here
as nowhere else the forces are developed
that determine character and conduct.
REV. GEORGE C. ADAMS
IS WELCOMED HOME
A welcome service of song was given at
the First Congregational Church last
night, tho occasion being the return of
the pastor, Rev. George C. Adams, D.D..
from a vacation trip through the United
States. Dr. Adams visited his old home
at Portland, Me., and attended the Inter
national Congregational Council at Bos
ton, Mass., in September. At Providence
R. 1., he preached before the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Na
tions.
As the service was of a choral nature
Dr. Adams omitted the sermon and only
addressed a few brief remarks on "The
Congregational National Council." He
said in part:
"You cannot in these days of personal
freedom dictate to a church as to what
it shall or shall not do. The American
spirit of liberty is gaining in the church.
In Congregationalism there is nothing
smothered. We talk right out. Nobody
has a right to tell a Congregationallst to
keep silent; if they do he has a right to
tell them he 'won't.' "
Dr. Adams expressed his gratification
at being in San Francisco again.
Â«
ELOQUENT DISCOURSE
BY FATHER McCOURT
Father McCourt preached an eloquent
j and forcible sermon at old St. Mary's
Church last night. A large congregation
' listened to his address with the closest
attention. His text was, "1 forgive thee
j all the debt because thou besoughtest
; me. Shouldst not thou then have had
compassion on thy fellow servant, even
as I had compassion on thee?" The
preacher said, in part:
It seems that one of the most diffi
cult virtues to acquire, and one of the
hardest to practice, is that virtue spoken of
to-day in the Gospelâ that of forgiveness of
injures, and yet it Is the virtue to which
we as Christians are most strict! v bound
Let the words of to-day's Gospel be" a warn
ing to you. The wicked servant had been
I freed from a heavy debt, yet he refused to
show a like favor to a fellow servant who
owed him a beggarly trifle. And his lord
being angry, delivered him to the tortures
( until he should pay all the debt. So also
| shall my heavenly Father do to you If you
torsive not every one his brother from
i your hearts.
WORRY AND NOT WORK
THAT KILLS MEN
] "Don't Worry" was the title of a ser
j mon delivered last night by Rev. K. Ne
â¢ lander before the congregation of the
j First English Lutheran Church. He chose
! as his text "Take therefore no thought."â
! Matthew vi:.'! 4. In part, he said:
It is not work that kills men; it is worry.
; A genuine Christian never worries, because
; God is managing hi* affairs. To him Ood
I says: "I have all the resources of the
i universe; when you get In trouble call on
Me and I will help." How much should
i that man worry? What lien will dare put
his paw on that Daniel? The Stoics would
I say. "What can't be cured must be eta
j dured." The. Christian philosophy is bet
l ter: "All thing* work together- for good
I to them that love God." Christ meant man
to be happy; this life to be as happy as
the next, old ever a to-morrow ... a darker

BOILER -MAKERS' TROUBLES.
i They Conclude to Await Action of
Union Iron Works Men.
The striking members of the Boiler-mak
j ers' and Iron Ship-builders' Union held
| a meeting at the A. O. F. Hall, 102 O'Far

minent, but Secretary Hall managed to
restore order and no active hostilities were

No definite decision was reached, the
men determining to await the action of
I the Union Iron Works boiler-makers.
: Secretary Hall stated that If the Union
, Iron Works boiler-makers went out the

FIGHT NOT
LIKELY TO BE
POSTPONED
Injury to Je fries' Arm Hardly
Grave Enough to End
His Training.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 15.â Whether the |
' championship flght between Jeffries and i
; Sharkey will be held as scheduled on :
j October 27 or postponed on account of the j
j champion having a strained arm is uncer- '
I tain as yet, but it will be definitely set- j
| tied on Tuesday morning. At that time
â  the bandages will be removed, and it de- ;
pends on the advice of a physician
whether he will continue to train for the
original date. The physician who exam-
I lned the arm thought the Injury was not j
j serious, and the latest advices from the
i training quarters are to the same effect. I
W. A. Brady and Tom O'Rourke will i
I meet in New York on Tuesday and will j
i decide. what is to be done. O'Rourke will !
I take a decided step against the postpone
i ment, and thinks the Injury is of no con- j
sequence. Sharkey Is of the same opinion, ;
I and thinks Jeffries has some other reason I
i for not wanting to fight on October 27 To
j night O'Rourke said:
"I believe Jeffries will be able to use !
I his arm in three days as well as he ever '
! did in his life, and he must either fight or
forfeit on October 27. Sharkey had been j
I injured just before he fought Jeffries in i
! San Francisco. A strain in his back had :
j affected his kidneys and he wanted a !
postponement, It was not allowed, and I
everybody knows the result. Since !
I Sharkey has been training for this fight |
I he has met with three accidents, any one I
of which I believe was as bad as Jeffries' '
Injury. When It became known some time i
I ago that Sharkey had cut his foot they
said at once that he did not want to fight,
and that this was merely an excuse. To ;
avoid this report being started again we
said nothing of the other accidents, and
he will be ready to fight when the time
comes. There must be some other reason
for Jeffries wanting to postpone the â 
I fight."
CORINTHIANS ON A CRUISE.
Yachtsmen of the Club Enjoy Chow
der and a Baseball Game at
Fasadise Cove.
On Saturday night several yachts of I
the Corinthian fleet accompanied Com- (
modore Carl Westerfeld's flagship Aeolus I
to Paradise Cove, being towed up by j
launches because of the lightness of the [
wind. A fire was built on the beach and
clam chowder and other good things were I
enjoyed. Yesterday there were lying at j
anchor in Paradise Cove the following j
yachts: Commodore Carl Westerfeld's
Aeolus, Vice Commodore W. H. Toepke '.
and Sharp's Harpoon. E. F. Sagar's' Ed- !
na. Paul Biber's Miction, J. Raymond's j
Will o' the Wisp, J. R. Savory's Juanita,

ler's Spray. Breltzmann's Cupid, F. E. i
Baker's Emilie, Hansen's Phoenicia and j
the schooner Wave.
About noon the yachtsmen went ashore I
and played the annual Corinthian base
ball game between the "Keegans," cap
tained by "Keegan" Schober, and the
"Fancies, captained by "Fancy." The
teams consisted of eleven men each, and
were as follows: "Fancies" â Follansbee,
Short, Thornton, Westerfeld. Sagar,
Hawkins, Kaiser. Delamater, Thompson,
Stack and Denhard. "Keegans"â Buck,
Ward. O'Brien, Brlckell. Ohlandt. Howe,
"Kavanaugh, Brennan, "Keegan." Strauss,
Morrow. Port Captain J. If. Keefe, with i
a marvelous red sash around his waist
and a mighty ax in his hand, undertook
the perilous office of umpire, while C.
Westerfeld and C. L. Barrett performed
the more obscure but less hazardous \
duties of scorers.
WAGERING ON THE BIG BOUT.
Champion Jeffries Opens a Warm
Favorite, but Sharkey Has
Ardent Admirers.
The first wagering on the forthcoming i
meeting of Champion Jeffries and "Tom" '
Sharkey was done at Harry Corbet tV, last
night. Jeffries was made favorite, the )
opening odds being 10 to 6. So many ad
mirers of Sharkey wanted to get on
money that the sailor advanced a point |
in the betting at once, the odds closing
at 10 to 7. Shrewd bettors affirm that
Sharkey will advance steadily In the pop- !
ular fancy and that when the men enter ;
the ring it will be even money.
Alex Groggains has arranged a number
of promising bouts for tho regular ex
hibition of the San Francisco Athletic
Club next Thursday evening. The prin
cipal bout will be between "Jack" Mc- ;
.Million and Gene Mulligan. The remain- !
Ing boxers are L. Richards and "Bud"
Terry; W. Fredericks and E. Duffy; T. ]
Irwin and "Jim" Terry. Bach of the con- â 
tests will be of four rounds' duration and
should provide the kind of sport the local
followers of boxing enjoy. Oreggalna
will, as usual, referee and can be relied
upon to keep the athletes continually at
work. !:

SHAFTER WILL
KEEP HIS TWO
SILVER STARS
To Retain His Rank as
Major-General.
To-day Is the date set for the retirement
of General Shafter from the ranks of the
regular army, and he would go on the re
tired list if it were not for the fact that he
ls now serving under a volunteer commis
sionâone which places j him beyond the
regulation requiring the retirement of offi
cers upon their sixty-fourth birthday. As
a matter of fr.c-t, h- will go on the reg
ular retired list, but he will continue to
command this department. ' ' j. '?-â  y:
General Shafter has received no notifi
cation of the fact that he will be retained, I
but the case does not call for notification.
The action of the law retires him from tne
regular service in the one case; the failure
to appoint a successor in command and to j
muster him out as a volunteer retains him
in the other. So General Shafter will re
main in command of this department at
the pleasure of the President.
No 'prentice hand can run matters mili
tary on this coast now, in which fact lies
the principal reason for the retention of
General Shafter. It is not generally known
what an amount of work is attached to
the caring for and transporting of the
thousands upon thousands of men who
have come and gone through this city
since the war broke out, and particularly
within the last few months. Since Gen
eral Shafter took command of the Depart
ment of California after his return from
Cuba twenty-eight regiments have gone
to Manila, besides nearly ten thousand
recruits, and there are eight more to go
within the next month or six weeks.
Then, too, there have returned from Ma
nila fifteen organizations of State volun
teers, all but two or three being full reg
iments, and aggregating over fifteen thou
sand men altogether; and further there
have been shiploads of discharged men
and sick men received, and ten sets of
barracks at the Presidio have been kept
full of sick and convalescents. Sixty-five
thousand men passing and repassing ln
the last half year would not be too large
an estimate, and in all the going and com
ing there has not been one man lost as
a result of the transportation arrange
ments; there has been no delay traceable
to the army management, and the regi
ments have followed each other from the
East and on out to -Manila as smoothly as
they have followed each other from Ma
nila and home to their own States after
being mustered out. At times there have
been quartered at the Presidio over twelve
thousand menâ ten nines as many as was
ever expected to be kept thereâ and there
has been no trouble, no sickness to speak
of and no complaint.
A newcomer would find it hard to keep
the department up to this standard, so
until all the volunteers have finished their
service and aan Francisco returns to its
former standing as a military station it
is probable the President will leave the
department in the general's hands.
Captain Ecitch, who has been recently
promoted from the Twenty-fourth to the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, will be General
Shatter's chief aid unless the adjutant
general wills otherwise. General Shafter
has asked that Captain Leitch be ap
pointed upon his staff, but as Captain
Leitch has by his promotion come under
the orders of the general commanding
the Department of Texas, It will be neces
sary for the adjutant general to make the
assignment.
Captain Klttredge, who was in the
service during the Spanish war aa
,an assistant adjutant general, was
to have been the second aid. He
had been mustered out, but wag
offered a captaincy in the Forty-sixth
Infantry. He declined the commission,
however, as his private Interests require
his entire attention. Lieutenant Wilson,
who is now General Shaffer's only aid,
will be retained. \ -'. 'ââ¢.;-, .*...'â¢ : -'.*..
Captain John Latterly, a retired officer
of the regular army, died at his home, 730
[ Grove street, yesterday. Captain Laf
ferty began his military career in 1864,
| when he was given a commission as first
: lieutenant In the First California Cavalry.
He served with that command until the
j close of the war, and he was then made a
! second lieutenant in the Eighth United
States Cavalry. He became a captain in
i 1876, and was retired for disability in
IS7S. During his service with the Eighth
Cavalry he distinguished himself for
bravery and ability, and he was more
than once complimented in orders by his
commanding officers. He particularly
distinguished himself on scouting expedi
tions, and on one occasion added to his
fame by meeting four hostile Indians
while away from his command and fight
ing them single handed. He killed two
and brought the other two back with him
Ito camp. He was a lieutenant then, and
for this exhibition of courage and ability
as a fighter he was recommended for a
! brevet as captain.
Captain Lafterty was badly wounded in
. this and other fights, and the effect of
: his wounds finally compelled his retire
'â  ment. Since then he has been in busi
ness in this city. He was a member of
| the Produce Exchange and was well
known among all the grain dealers, and
: a member of the Loyal Legion, the Cali
fornia Volunteers, the Ancient Order of
| United Workmen and the Knights of
Honor. He has two sons who served
during the late war with . the Oregon
| Volunteers.
First Lieutenant Charles A. Phillips of
the Thirty-second Infantry and Second
Lieutenant James A. Simpson of the
Thirty-first have been ordered to their
homes to he mustered out for disability.
The Forty-second Infantry, recruiting
at Port Niagara. N. V.. and the Fortieth
Infantry, recruiting at Fort Riley, Kans.,
have been ordered to prepare for trans
portation to the Presidio. The Forty
second is under Colonel .1. Milton Thomp
son, formerly a major in the Twenty
fourth Infantry, and the Forty-second is
commanded by Colonel Arthur Murray,
formerly a captain in the First Artillery.
First Lieutenant John W. Barker, Third
Infantry, has been assigned to the trans
port Newport as quartermaster and com
missary for her next trip. v. >
A delegation of friends and relatives
of the lowa boys arrived in the city yes
terday and registered at the Occidental,
where they will remain until the trans
port bearing home their heroes Is report
ed. When seen yesterday they said that
as yet no definite plans had been made
for the entertainment of the boys when
they should reach their native State, as
it was deemed best to wait until an op
portunity be had to consult the men
themselves. The people of lowa, how
ever, arc willing to turn the State up
side down to give the lads anything they
want, and the regiment can rest assured
that the reception it will get from the
people of the State they have so dis
tinguished will he fully equal to anything
of the kind that has preceded it.

LITTLE MISS FOWLER
VERSUS EDDIE FOY
There was a blast of trumpets and beat
ing of drums when Josie De Witt came
to town with the "Topsy Turvy" circus.
There was a still bigger blast and beating
for Eddie Foy. Almost unhearlded came
little Mies Fowler, with a wardrobe that
wouldn't flll a hand satchel and a budget
of imitations that ten minutes sees the
last of. And with her modest little outfit
she proceeds to make business for the
Columbia, while Josie and Eddie fill up
time. ~ -, "
Miss Fowler, clumpy, in plaid and pig
tails, never for a minute takes herself
seriously. She knows that by playing
Marlette the violets and carnations art
forever sacrificed. They will be for some i
decollete lady or begllttered dancer. There |
Isn't a heart in town in any wise endan- j
gered by her visit, but there ls a royal !
good laugh to her credit. And perhaps she j
chuckles a little in her sleeve when she
reflects that the laugh will live to see I
those footllght darlings Inserting a card
ln dramatic monthlies or maKing the
vaudeville rounds.
As for Eddieâ poor Eddie: There is a
tradition that his every entrance is the !
cue for laughter, and America clings i
blindly to the tradition. That laughter
being accomplished, the duty is performed. ;
It will not have to be attended to again ;
until his next entrance. Under other cir
cumstances, Eddie might* be pathetic. :
One might think of him as still plodding
on, footsore and weary, with thirteen
clamoring mouths to feed and the mort- 'â¢
gage coming due. But it doesn't seem to
be so. Instead, he clings to center stage
like a fourth season belle, and contrives
to thrust himself In between the audience :
and some rather clever people.
"Hotel Topsy Turvy" is from New York. !
and from Paris before that. It is only a
fairly well written farce, but the twing
of it and the twang of it smack of im
portation. For which let us be duly grate- I

A FOOLHARDY TEAMSTER.
Patrick Lyons Vainly Attempted to
Beat the San Jose Train.
Patrick Lyons, teamster for Warren &
Malley, contractors, had a narrow escape
from death at Sixth and Townsend streets
yesterday, through his own carelessness.
Lyons had driven from the King street
wharf with a wagon-load of bricks and
reached the crossing just as the San Jose
train, which left the depot at Third and
Townsend streets at 11:30 a. m., was ap
proaching. F. Hindle, a yardman, warned
Lyons to stop till the train had passed
the crossing, but he paid no attention
to the warning. D. H. Gates, engineer of
a train that was standing near the cross
ing, also warned him to stop, but he
whipped up his horses and endeavored to
cross the track before the train reached
him.
The result was that the engine struck
the hind wheel of the wagon and Lyons
was thrown. Into the air and struck the
ground with his head. The wagon was
knocked into kindling-wood and the bricks
were distributed over the track.
Lyons was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital In the ambulance, where Dr. Stephen
found that his right collar-bone was
broken and he had sustained a lacerated
wound of the scalp. His wounds were
dressed and later he was sent to the City
and County Hospital.
NANCE O'NEIL IS A
SUCCESSFUL MAGDA
Nance O'Neil ls successful In her por
trayal of "Magda," because she invests
it with that foreign air which makes her
unlike all the other (domestic) characters.
Notwithstanding her longing for peace
and her expressions for love for her sis
ter and father, one knew she did not fit
in these surroundings, and from the very
moment she entered her home It was easy
to foresee a catastrophe. In "Magda," as
in "The Jewess," we have one scene that
displays the dramatic instinct of the art
iste. In the latter it was in the "curse
scene," in the former the accusation
scene. How dignified and proud; how
beautiful in her just wrath was this trag
edienne when her Magda accused her
faithless lover of his cowardice, his vil
lainy and dishonor in scathing terms of
sarcasm! How she enveloped him with
burning words of anger! How she stabbed
him with the dagger of ire! Only an
actress who puts her very soul Into her
declamation can obtain results such as
ornament the performance of Nance
O'Neil. ALFRED METZGER.

not appear. Father Yorke will probably
return to this city about the first of No

BOY SET UPON
AND STABBED
BY HOODLUMS
Sam Johnson Will
Lose an Eye.
â  â  :7- â  - -_â .â¢â  -â : A -'â ' ' -.
Highway robbery - , in broad daylight,
was committed yesterday at East and
Merchant streets, by a gang of young
boys ranging from 10 to 13 years of age.
Their victim, Sam A. Johnson, a lad or
16 years, was stabbed twice in the eye by
one of the boys, when it was discovered
that no booty could be secured. Young
Jonnson is in a seii >v-< condition at the re
ceiving Hospital and will lose his left
eye. j-iis assailants escaped.
Young Johnson, with his father, George
P. Johnson, arrived two weeks ago at
San Francisco from Alaska, where they
had been engaged in mining. They haa
lost all of their money in a fruitless search
for gold and secured a room in the Contra
Costa lodging-house, at 14 Jackson ;
street. The father was unable to get a
job in this city and the boy secured em
ployment in a Kearney-street bakery to
assist his parent in tiding over his
financial difficulties. It was the boy s
habit, every afternoon, when he left his
work, to join his father in the vicinity of
their lodging. __W_____f â  *_-â " , .
The lad reached the corner of Merchant
and East streets yesterday afternoon
about half past 4 o'clock. He remained
there for a few minutes. After a time a'
group of six or seven boys approached.
One of them was mounted on a large
black horse and the others were armed
with pieces of gas pipe and sticks. The
boy on the horse chased young Johnson
into a doorway, while his companions
crowded in upon their victim. A demand
was then made for 5 cents.
Johnson replied that he did not have any
money, but scarcely had he time to repi/
when he was seized and his pockets turned,
inside out. The would-be robbers then
found" that the lad had told the truth.
They set upon their victim and beat him
with the weapons they held.
Johnson snatched a whip from the
hands of the boy on the horse and made
a feeble attempt to defend himself and to
escape. Suddenly one of the boys struck
him with the blade of a knife twice, once
over the eye and the second time in the
eye. it::-.
After the assailants had fled young
Johnson wandered about the street for
some time, until he was found by the
landlord of the house where he was stop
ping. Later he was removed to the Har
bor Hospital and then sent to the City
Hall, where he remained last night. His
eye will have to be removed.
Officer Dower of the Harbor Police Sta
tion was detailed on the case, but up to
an early hour this morning he had not
succeeded In landing any of the young
highwaymen. Young Johnson says he can
identify the boys, but was in such in
tense pain last night that he was unable
to furnish the police any accurate de
scription of his assailants.

ARMSTRONG TO EXPLAIN
PAINTING CONTRACTS
Conlon's Agent, Freeman Lewis,
Awarded All the Jobs,
Hundreds of Dollars' Worth of Work Done,
but No Proposals Were Invited.
Bills Split to Come Within
the Limit.
SCHOOL DIRECTOR ARMSTRONG,
chairman of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee of the Board of
Education, has climbed up on the
anxious seat with Messrs. Gedge
and Conlon, and together the three
are cooling their heels awaiting the result
of this week's investigations by the Fin
ance Committee. Up to the present time
Armstrong has been sadly neglected by
that body. Official scrutiny has been di
rected solely to the accounts of Gedge and
Conlon, but in the light of recent develop
ments Armstrong's case demands inquiry,
and it will be attended to this week un
less the plans of tho committee are un
expectedly changed.
It has been the case with all School
Boards that have brought forth scandals
of ample proportions that there was a
close and profitable connection between
the heads of the Supplies and Buildings
a.".d Grounds Committees. Profits that ac
crued to either Job would not be worth
the working if this were not the case. It
is. in fact, largely the duty of the chair
man of the Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee to create the necessity for the
paint and lumber and things the chairman
of the Supplies Committee subsequently
contracts for with his favorite contractor.
From all the information before the
Finance Committee there is good reason
to believe that the present board is proving
no exception to the honored custom. In
fact Conlon confessed as much when he
threatened to take Armstrong on a little
trip "up the bay" if he persisted in his
Intention to vote for the demand for his
resignation. Attention was first called to
the connection between Armstrong and
Conlon by a bunch of "phoney" bills for
painting filed by Freeman Lewis, the
painter. The claims were for painting
done on four schools, the Mission Gram
mar, John Swett. Clement and Horace
Mann. There were three bills against
each school. The Mission Grammar was
charged with $195, $185 and $55; the John
Bwett with $70, $180 and $190: the Clement
with $65, $1M and $193; the Horace Mann
with JISO, $190 and $65. The bills were sus
pected the moment they came before the
Finance Committee, and a little inquiry
developed the fact that although they
were divided into three Installments, in
each case they actually represented but
one job of painting, and that no proposals
for the work had been Invited by Arm
strong, notwithstanding it i? a rule of the
board that the chairman of the Building
and Grounds Committee shall authorize
no work in excess of $200 without con-'
tractlng for it. There were no deductions
necessary. Armstrong was convicted by
SOUGHT DEATH
AS SOLACE FOR
MANY SORROWS
Miss Nora Sheean At-
tempted Suicide.
Having left her home owing to family
troubles, caught up by the whirlpool of
vice in a big city, downcast at her fate
and fearing the future, Nora Sheean, j
daughter of Timothy Sheean of the Mare
Island Navy Yard, attempted suicide in
this city Saturday night by means of car
bolic acid. The unfortunate girl is scarce
ly IS years old, and according to the state
ment of Mrs. H. M. McEwen of 153 Third
etreet, who formerly lived in Vallejo and
has known the girl from childhood, her
downfall is due entirely to the unhappi
ness of her home surroundings. The girl
decided some weeks ago to come to this
city and take a course at a business col
lege, intending to secure a position and
earn her own living independent of her
parents.
She visited Mrs. McEwen frequently
Fince her arrival here, and looked to her
for Counsel and advice. She -called upon
her friend Friday night, and at that time I

| the facts, and there the matter was al
i lowed to drop, although Lewis' bills were |
held up and are still unpaid upon the rec- i
ommendation of George Walker, the ex
pert, who investigated the work.
Later, however, the discovery was made I
that Freeman Lewis was being awarded :
all of the painting in the department, and \
was acting simply as an agent for Di- j
rector Conlon. It was further found that
all of the paint used by Lewis was the ;
I product of Yates & Co., and that Conlon's !
paint shop on Golden Gate avenue was
stocked with the same goods. It was also
developed that Conlon was the "success- j
ful bidder" on all contracts with the last '
Board of Education, and, like Lewis in the
present case, was the official repairer, and
even then used the Yates paint. The fur
ther significant discovery was made that i
it was Conlon's custom at that time to
Bplit his bills and avoid the necessity of
entering into contracts at a required low
er price, in precisely the manner Lewis i
was pursuing with the present board.
Then the Investigation was reopened and
Armstrong was charged by Conlon with
having overspent his allowance without !
authority of the board. It had come to be !
a well-known fact in the department that
Armstrong had provided in three months '
for the painting of more school buildings
than were painted in a year by the last
board, and that in many cases he had
i ordered the painting of buildings which
were coated not over a year ago. To the
committee the facts argued a strict atten
tion to his duties, but it was also realized I
that it was making most excellent busi- ;
: ness and no small profits for Conlon's I
; man Lewis and the favored dealers in ;
| Yates & Co.'s paints, all of which the
i Finance Committee duly considered and
will this week proceed to carefully inves
tigate. j
Gedge and Conlon spent the better part
!of yesterday along, the cocktail route

from the Grand Jury nor from any j
charges made by The Call. They claim to

cation and the reassignment of teachers
Conlon cannot buy a dollar's worth of '
goods without the consent of the Finance j
Committee, and it looks as though there
is a hard winter ahead for that new paint
store on Golden Gate avenue. Armstrong
is badly tied up, and it is said by those
who are on the inside that the present in
vestigation will result in a bunch of de
sirable resignations if Bergerot and the
rest of the Crimmins element can be
brought into line to stand for it.

GROVE AVERS ON FIRE
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK
GROVE P. ATERS, one of the best known "for
warding" agents of the city, was on fire yesterday
afternoon in Golden Gate Park. He was envel
oped for several thrilling minutes in flames and
smoke and might even now be the only cinder on
' the speed track had his wife not "put him out." He had
[ all the appearance of a miniature volcano in action and
: was giving off an odor reminiscent of burning rubber
when Mrs. Ayers began tearing off the flaming outer
garments of her fiery spouse and soon had him under
control, singed a little, underdone ln spots, choking with
smoke and almost blinded with the sand thrown on him
ln efforts to stay his cremation. " ; -: â  â *â -.-â  , â ."*â¢--â -,
Ayers, who Is a great lover of speedy horseflesh,
secured yesterday from a friend the loan of a fast road
ster and a "biKe" buggy. He invited Mrs. Ayers to ac
company him for a spin through the park as a sort of
compensation for the fact that politics had kept him
away from nome several nights during the past week.
In a short time the roadster was hitting the speed
track in record time, Mr. and Mrs. Ayers bowling along
merrily behind.
Ayers' perfecto was burning like a headlight in th;
breeze and was mingling Its smoke with the dust his
trotter was throwing in the faces of everything on the
line. The mere fact that it was a borrowed horse acted
like a spur to Avers. His whole ambition was to take
it back to its owner covered with sweat and glory and
tell him what an equine wonder was his.
About this time another driver with a fast stepper
and a "bike" buggy came up with a rush out of the
LEADING JOURNALIST
HERE ON A SHORT VISIT
H. H. KOHLSAAT, Owner of The Chicago Times-Herald.
HH. KOHLSAAT, editor and proprietor of the Chicago Times-Herald,
arrived yesterday at the Palace Hotel from his home. He is accom
panied by his father-in-law, Mr. E. Nelson Blake, president of ; the
First National Bank of Arlington, Mass.
* The report had come over the wire that Mr. Kohlsaat was a very
sick man, and that his trip to this coast was being taken for the
purpose of gaining back a little of the health that he had lost through too
close and long application to business. This report â  Mr. Kohlsaat strongly
denied, saying that he never felt better in his life, and that the reason of
his coming here was simply to take a little vacation and to accompany his
wife's father on a trip he had long had under consideration.
"Yes," said Mr. Blake, "I have wished to visit the coast and once more
view the scenes that I knew fifty years ago, when, after arriving here on the
first ship that brought to California the news of her admission to the sister
hood of States, I accompanied General Bidwell up into the country, in the
vicinity of Chico. Those were the wild days of mountain lions and grizzly
bears, and many a night I have slept alongside my haystack with a rifle in
my hands to protect my property from the depredations of roving bands of
Indians.
"General Bidwell was a great friend of. mine, as was also Captain Sutter.
The former gentleman offered to make me a present of a square mile of land
in the neighborhood of Chico if I would remain In the country. Filial duty,
however, compelled me to return to my Boston home, and I was not able to
accept his kind offer. My one wish has always been to get back here to re
visit the scenes of my early adventures, and, the chance offering itself this
fall, I Jumped at it, and persuaded my son-in-law to accompany me."
Mr. Kohlsaat is a pleasant spoken gentleman, whose sijver white hair
gives the dignity of age to a face whose youthful appearance belles the
prominence of the man that owns it. In discussing things in a general way
Mr. Kohlsaat had occasion to speak of the recent experiments with wireless
telegraphy. ' * 7 .y. y ;.
' "The science of wireless telegraphy," he said, "is still In its infancy. But
the use to which it has been put during the recent yacht races in New York
proves conclusively to my mind that it is a complete success, and a very valu
able one, as far as short distances are concerned. I have no doubt that in a
little while Its sphere will be as thoroughly enlarged as has been the sphere
of the telephone or the telegraph to which we have become accustomed. Take
in the recent instance when one of the New York excursion boats was report
ed lost with 2000 people on board. The rumor was circulated throughout the
city, and people were nearly crazy with grief and apprehension. The Herald
had merely to telegraph to Marconi, who was on a vessel near the scene of the
reported disaster, and immediately word was received saying that the ex
cursion boat was all right and the story a canard. You can't beat that.
"I am merely out here for pleasure and to accompany Mr. Blake. I shall
remain about three or four days, and then return home via the Southern
route. My health was never better in my life, all reports to the contrary not
withstanding, and I am enjoying every minute of my visit, which is the first
one I have made to your city since '85."
ruck. Ayers' sporting blood was aroused at the temerity
of the newcomer, and telling his wife to hang on to tne
seat, he let out a wrap or two on his roadster and settled
down to do the rash driver of the other rig. He "cluck
clucked" to the horse, and in so doing dropped the
flaming cigar, as he thought, on to the speedway, but in
reality on his own breast between his coats.
Away he sped ahead of the other fellow, unmindful of
the smoke that was rising about him, believing it to be
the result of friction from the fast going. Mrs. Ayers,
who was hanging onto the seat for dear life, did not no
tice the volcanic condition of her husband until he slowed
down a little and turned to get a view of the other fellow.
Then she saw that he was ablaze. She acted promptly.
Grabbing her astonished husband, she began tearing off
the burning garments. His overcoat was off before he
knew it. His necktie followed suit and his five-barred
shirt, which was once a dream in pink and white, was
torn from his manly bosom.
For a moment Ayers thought that his better half had
become possessed and was on the point of arguing the
matter with her when the burningundershirt communicated
its fire to the cuticle over his wishbone. With a yell of
surprise he jumped out of the buggy.
"Holy smoke!" he shrieked. "I'm afire! Put me out!
Put me but!" And he began rolling in the dirt and
throwing sand on himself like a howling dervish, unmind
ful of the fact that the other driver had not only come up
to but passed him. Mrs. Ayers did heroic service in smoth
ering the flames and in hustling her smoldering hubby into
the buggy and homeward, where liberal applications of
sweet oil were made to the sore spots.
METSON LEADS
A RUNAWAY IN
A WILD RACE
An Exciting Incident
at the Park.
Park Commissioner W. H. Metson,
mounted on his thoroughbred, yesterday
afternoon led a runaway horse a wild
race down the main drive of the park.
It was shortly after the opening of the
musical programme that the exciting in-
cident occurred. A driver of the Santa
Clara Milk Company left his horse stand
ing in front of a residence on Seventh
avenue and for some cause unknown it
suddenly bolted. Down the avenue to the
park sped the maddened animal and
finally turned into the drive leading
around the old Midwinter Fair grounds.
A. J. Lawton of 7 Belvedere street was
cycling around the drive and when no
saw the plunging horse turn in his di
rection he tried to escape, but was too
late. The wheels of the milk wagon
struck the bicycle and Lawton was hurled
to the pavement. He jumped to his feet
immediately, however, having escaped
serious Injury, but the wheel was demol
ished.
From the fair grounds drive the horse
turned into the main boulevard and it
was then that Commissioner Metson saw
that he had a runaway to deal with.
Turning his horse he sped down the drive
abreast of the runaway, which had kicked
the remains of the wagon loose from the
traces, and a race of a hundred yards
gave him a good lead.
It was like the finish of a Derby, this
race between a thoroughbred and a milk
wagon horse sped by fear. As the race
neared the concourse at the bandstand
Mounted Officer Nelson R. Nortons Joined
in and the race was over. The officer's
riata fell over the runaway's neck and
with distended tongue the animal was
choked into submission.
A short time later it looked as if an
other runaway would occur. Wallace L.
Thompson started to leave the concourse
behind a rig in which two women were
seated. The women backed their hors3
into that driven by Mr. Thompson. His
horse plunged aside, toppled the bugg-
and smashed the wheel. Mounted officers
grasped the holrse by the bit, unhitched
him and removed the wreckage. T__la
ended the list of accidents for the day
As usual a dozen scorchers fell Into the
hands of the police for fast riding. Those
arrested were E. C. Learning, a well

Nicoll, W. R. Douglas, H. P. Brown W*
J. Pitchford, D. Harris, A. Layskle J*

and Roy Brandt. S. J. Thomas was ar
rested Tor using vulgar language. On
September 4 Thomas was arrested for
fast driving, but was released with a repri
mand. Yesterday he witnessed the arrest
of another scorcher and the officer says
that he commented on the arrest with
such unusual vehemence that he arrested
him. A number of the cyclers taken in
deposited ball and were released, and late
in the afternoon Judge Conlan released
the others on their own recognizances
The bill at the Chutes Theater was ex
cellent. Adgie and her lions, however
fell to third place In the list of attrac
tions, Major Mite taking first place on the
bill. This little man, whom It is said will
marry Chlqulta at the Paris Fair is an

in which class his size would ordinarily
place him, but as a vaudeville star He
is a finished performer, and with a min
iature photo of Chiquita pinned to his
breast, he finished his turns amid a storm
of applause. Baby Ruth Roland, a tiny
miss, undoubtedly occupied the next posi
tion in the affections of the audience
and it was only after the little woman
was thoroughly wearied with her efforts
that the audience consented that she re
tire. The giant galapagos, the elephant

many other attractions were not neglect

1. HOW TO STUDY SHAKESPEARE
Let us suppose that one Is approaching
Shakespeare for the first time. if he feels
i himself at a loss to know what to do be
yond reading lch play through it is be
cause he. does not know what to look for.
â¢For that Is what study is. It is a -looking
for something and an endeavor to ascer
tain when one has found it. In arithmetic
and algebra it is a looking for. the answer
to a problem; or rather to the processes
lending to the discovery of the answer.
In history lt is a looking for the causes
which have made individuals or nation?
I great, and the reasons for their decline
lor overthrow. In chemistry it Is a look
ing for the elements of which a body is
composed and the proportions in which
those elements enter Into the constitution
of the body. In psychology it is a look
ing for the traits which go to make up-hu
man nature. In painting It is a looking
for the secrets of color, of beautiful line,
of atmosphere, of comr f " r :t'on, of. tone.
As a!! study Is a search. â  the question.
How to study Shakespeare? Is best ap
proached through the question, What
shall we look for in Shakespeare?
1 shall, of course, not attempt to enum
erate all the things which one' may rea
sonably hope to And in the dramas which.
by common consent, stand at the summit
FROM THE STRATFORD PORTRAIT.
(The pretentious painting known as the Stratford portrait and presented In IPS? by W.
O. Hunt town clerk of Stratford, to the Birthplace Museum, where It Is very prominently
displayed, was probably [..aimed from the bust In the Stratford church late In the eight
eenth century.)
of England's literature. if not of the |
world's, but shall content myself with
mentioning a Tew of the more obvious. If j
at the same time they represent funda
mental aspects of the poet's work and are ,
profitable subjects for prolonged consid
eration. ;
1. It ls related by St. Augustine that,
upon the recitation In the theater of the
famous line of Terence, "I am a man. and
I consider naught that Is human beneath
my regard," the whole audience broke
out into thunderous acclamation. Shake
speare might have adopted the line as his i
motto. Beyond any other writer he has
exemplified Pope's sentiment: "The proper
stud* of mankind is man." He was a
hero worshiper when hero worship was
possible; when he could not approve he
vet loved, and when he could not love he
scrutinized, he analyzed, he revealed. THe j
individual soul is to him Infinite!: at
tractiveânay, engrossing; he is appreciat
ive of Its virtues and aspirations, tolerant
of its foibles and amused by its harmless
or delightful eccentricities; he sounds Its
deepest passions, comprehends the main
springs of its activity, ami. while watch
ing how It Is impelled by desire or precip
itated by circumstance toward an inescap
able future, he Is touched by its pathos
;md its tragedy, or exults, In Its attain
ment ed its |oy. Partake Shakespeare's
delight in life and in the play of life upon
life if you mid derive impulse and in
struction from the vast spectacle of man,
if you would fir.d a village rife with mo
mentous mystery nd -make the circle of
your acquaintance a theater replete with
the curious and the wonder; Begin this
study In any play of Shakespeare. Count
up its distinct characters; note their In
dividual traits; see to what types they
sevenallv belong and to what classes of
society;" observe how they behave in dif
ferent situations, and how they react one
upon another, and discover how far they
resemble the men and women that you
know or that you ha' read about. When
you have done this with half a dozen
dramas try to form some conception of
the range of Interest, the closeness of ob
servation and the quickness and versatil
ity of sympathy of the man who could
Imagine and create this world of human
beii-.^s. You will thus have begun to
study Shakespeare and perhaps to find a
new meaning in the world about you.
2. Notwithstanding Shakespeare's ab
sorption in the individual soul, notwith
standing his sympathetic interpretation

the drunkard, or the monster lower than
man â If any monster can be lower than
degraded manâ yet he ls never at a loss
to exhibit a scale of values for his person- .
ages. They are not equal in spiritual
rank, and he never pretends they are. We j
feel with Caliban, as more righteous be- .
ings than ourselves would feel with Indi- ;
â  ans and other barbarians, when he Bays: i
Wan) thou earnest first
Thou strokrst me and ma much â  of me, ,

For I am all tlie subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king, and __ you

The rest i>' the island.
Yet though we resent the apparent Injust
ice which he suffers v,e never suppose
bim to" be the peer of Miranda or Pros
pero. We may make merry with Falstaff
and find his wit, his roguery and resource'
infinitely diverting, yet Shakespeare con
vinces us of his essential vileness and fu
tllltv, and even causes us in some meas
ure "to despise ourselves for our laughing
condonation of his vices, when Prince Hal,
now king indeed, touches him as with the
spear of tthuriel and causes him to appear
in his true aspect. (("2 Hen. IV." 51-74).
3. Shakespeare has the greatest respect
for the civic virtues, for those which hold
together the framework of society. It
follows that he brands with his abhor
rence all treachery, disloyalty and ingrat
itude, all ruthless and insolent tyranny
and all deliberate failure to co-operate in
the advancement of the common weal.
Aim. every one of the more serious
plays, and even some of the comedies, will
furnish Instances in proof. In "King
Lear" he stigmatizes filial ingratitude; in
"Macbeth" regicide and oppression; In
"The Tempest" treason; and these are but
specimens. . Now and again the whole
tempest of his eloquence is poured out in
a flood on the unsocial vices, on lawless
ness, anarchy and rift. A single example
may serve ("Timon of Athens/* iv, 1.):
Slaves and fools
Pluck the grave-wrinkled senate from the
bench.
And minister In their steads'.

And cut your trusters' throats!
I â¢j.'> v f. Piety and fear.
Religion to the gods, peace, J oat lee. truth.
Domestic awe, night-rest and neighborhood.
Instruction, manners, mysteries and trades.
Degreed, observances, customs and laws,
Defcllhe 1 to your confounding contraries.
And let confusion live! BOH
It will be observed that piety and re
ligion are conceived quite in the old Ro
man spirit, primarily as the bonds which
knit up the social fabric and preserve It
from ruinous disintegration. Another tin.,
passage, which every good citizen should
meditate at least ice a year, is "Troilus
and- 'Oressida," 1. lii, S5-124. Compare
"Lear." I. ii. H5-S; 11. I. 49-s<>: 'â¢Measure
For Measure." I, ;' ! . 30-31. etc. It musv
be admitted that Shakespeare was no be
liever in democracy. He is everywhere
contemptuous of the rabble, the vulgar,
the people, as he terms them. Thus ("2
Hen. IV." 1. lii, 89-90):
An habitation giddy and unsure
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
Again! "Antony and Cleopatra," I, 11,
IP2-4.):
Our slippery people.
Whose love Is never linked to the deserver
Till his deserts are past.
From such passages it is clear that
Shakespeare empties the vials of his scorn
upon instability and Infirmity of purpose
with relation to the discharge of civic du
ties, and that, like Dante, he regards
vacillation as only one degree less despic
able than overt an i flagrant iniquity. .
4. While It is thus true that Shakespeare
has for his characters a scaieof values and
recognizes a pantheon of virtues, It must
be said, on the other hand, that there is
an excellence for which he has but scant
and conventional appreciation. 1 refer to
the virtue which has primary reference to
God, as those already mentioned have to
man or the state. Though he can at times
manifest tenderness and reverence In his
allusions to sacred things (as, c. -g., "1
Hen. IV. I. i. IS-27; "Hamlet/ I. i. 15S-164;
"All's Well." 11. i. I^9-144), yet for rever
ence, for worship, for holiness of life, he
in general has but Blight regard. The
amiable friar in "Romeo and Juliet" by no
means Inspires unqualified reverence; the
ambitious Gloucester, not yet become
King Richard Hi. is willingly supported
ln his young .hypocrisy by two bishops,
and the saintly seeming Angelo in "Meas
ure for Measure" has but stolen the livery
of the court of heaven to serve the devil
in. It Is true that in this same play we
have mention of
Prayers from preserved souls.
From fasting maids; whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.
but the character of Isabella must be re
garded as a quite exceptional one. and
Shakespeare could hardly have sympa
thised with the sentiment of Milton ("Par
adise Lost," 11, 603-6):
Judge not what is best
By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet,
Created as thou art to nobler end.
Holy and pure, conformity divine.
Shakespeare came between the earlier
ages of faith, with their exaltation of re
ligion, and the puritanism of the seven
teenth century. He finds the middle ages
picturesque and despises the Puritans; he
himself Is a child of the renaissance, and
his kingdom Is a kingdom of this world.
5. While Shakespeare's prime Interest is
In humanity he yet has an open eye for
the terror, the majesty and the beauty of
the physical universe and for the aspect
of all things visible. Take but two Illus
trationsâthe one of the sun ("Richard
II," 111, ii. 41-2*. when
From under the terrestrial hall
, He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines;
the other of the winds ("2 Hen. IV, 111,
1, 2^-4-:
, Who take the ruffian billows by,.tho tops.
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging;
f. -.-â  them '*;-..;
I With deafening clamor In the slippery clouds;
I or, if you wish another, add the picture
of a navy afloat ("Henry V, 111, prof. 7
-14).. But in any case note how be person
ifiesâhow .he makes nature alive with
man.
0.- Shakespeare has deiinite views con
cerning poetry, its nature and processes.
iThus he proclaims th" office of poetry to

He affirms a deep and hard truth ("As

THE WORLDS GREAT ARTISTS.
I. TITIAN, THE NESTOR OF THE
ITALIAN RENAISSANCE
BY ARTHUR LINCOLN FROTHINGHAM
JR., PH. D.
There Is very little mystery In Titian's
life and practical unanimity as. to his art.
He was the most finished embodiment of
the sensuous aspect of the developed ren
aissance of Italy. He was also, on account
of his life of 99 years, a living history of
Venetian painting in its whole period of
bloom. He witnessed both the dawn and
the decline of the golden age of the ren
aissance.
Titian's surroundings made him what he
was. Before his day Venetian art had not
come into line with other Italian schools.
The 'Id. diplomatic, mercantile Venetians
had loved the gorgeous side of the ancient
art of the Byzantine empire; they had not
felt the religious emotions that accom
panied and made possible the Giottesque
art of the rest of Italy. Superb color and
lack Â« of Inner life characterized their
school of painting until the middle of the
fifteenth century, only a generation before
Titian's birth. It was then that the Bel
lini family imported into Venice some of
the results of the study of the antique, of
the science of perspective and of the hu
man form and character, that had. been
transforming the Tuscan school of the
early renaissance. Still, even under Bel
lini, the Venetian school maintained a dis
tinct individuality, due to the character of
the people and the atmosphere of the la-
goons; lt still relied upon color rather
than upon drawing; on an appeal to the
senses rather than to the intellect; on
texture rather than action. But the Bel
lini were still essentially devoted to reli
gious or historic art. They Â»were not
destined to be frankly psychological and
to embody in paint the dreaminess of the j
sea haze, the intangible phases of the
landscape, the sensuous delight of drift
ing on the lagoons by night, the content
that comes from ignoring the conscience
and opening the arms to all physical de
lights. This was reserved for their suc
cessors. :;V. t ' ,
Titian was born in 1477 of the noble Ve
celli family, at Pleve dl ("adore, in the
Alpine region north of Venice.. At the age
of 9 or 10 he was brought to Venice to
study painting, first in the studio of the
Mosaicist Zuccato, and later under the
gentle Bellini. He finally appears to have
passed Into the extensive workshop of
Giovanni Bellini, who for many years had
been and was long after to remain the
supreme ruler of Venetian painting..
But the Impress that young Titian re
ceived from these last representatives of
the early renaissance was neither strong
nor lusting, for his spirit was that of the
new age and his fellowship with the young
men waiting, like himself, for a leader to
appear. Such a leader came ln Giorgione.
the sensuous poet-painter, the dreamer of
Idyls; no older than Titian, but with the
spark of intuition, of genius, which he
lacked. The two young men became close
associates under Giorgione's material as
well as Ideal guidance. It is at times as
difficult to distinguish the contemporary
works of these two young artists as those
of the famous Greek sculptors, Scopas
and Praxiteles, so deeply had Titian be
come impregnated from the stronger
spirit. The association lasted until Gior
gione's death; the artistic dependence
never quite ended. ;
Titian was slow in attaining fame. Not
until h'.s thirtieth year, in 1507, when he
assisted Giorglonc In decorating the pal
ace called Fondaco del Tedeechl, does he
seem to have acquired an independent
reputation. On GltÂ»Â£glone's premature
death, in 1510. Titian completed a number
of his friend's unfinished pictures. Almost
Immediately he received his tirst Impor
tant Independent commission, for a se
ries or sixteen frescoes n the Scuola del
Santo at Padua. He filled to show in
them any special proficiency ln the style
of grand composition. J
A glance at what is known of Titian's
pictures up to this time shows but few
landmarks. The "M^.n of Sorrows" (S.
Bocco, Venice) typifies his study under
Bellini; the "Zlngarella" Virgin (Vienna),
the beginning of Giorgione's influence in
about 1500, with the added earthiness that
was Titian's, while the "Pope Alexander
VI Presenting a Bishop to St. Peter"
(Antwerp), painted toward 1502, shows
that Giorgione's influence was not yet
complete and also marks the first step in
his series of great portraits. All Titian's
works up to about 1505 are religious sub
jects, not varying fundamentally from the
Bellini and Cima type. but. soon after,
Titian, under Giorgione's guidance, enter
ed the enchanted sphere of poetic alle
gory, where, unlike religious art. there
was no tradition to prevent a completely
original treatment. HoweVer graceful are
Titian's worlfc at this time, such as the
"Baptism of Christ" in Rome (Capitol),
he is not yet a master. He "finds" him
self, though still in a Glorgione garb, in
the two allegories called "The' Three
Ages" and the famous "Sacred and Pro
fane Love," probably painted just before
Giorgione's death. Even in his early
treatment of these themes the aroma of
Giorgione's poetry has evaporated.. It is
true that the sensuousness has not vet, as
it will later, lapse Into complete sensual
ity, but Titian already shows in the "Pro
fane Love" his delight in the splendors of
the female form. â¢ .' -
. After his . Paduan work Titian signal
ized his return to Venice by a superb "St.
Mark Enthroned' Among Saints" (1512),
and then, aspiring; to a more public rec
ognition of his position, hp began, in 1613
an attempt to dispossess of his monopoly
the aged monarch. Giovanni Bellini. Ti
tian's appointment as state painter help
. (i to procure him the favor of. his first
great art patron, Alfonso d'Este, Juke of.
Kerrara, for whom he painted, religious,
allegorical and mythological subjects, as
well as portraits. : for many years. The
famous "Christ and the Tribute Money"
in Dresden was painted for him. Titian's
male portraits at this time still had the
gentle, poetic melancholy of Giorgione,
i without the sensuality that had crept Into
his female figures. The bearded man In
Munich, and especially the superb
i "Young Man With the Glove" (Louvre),
! are the most exquisite of this class, the
most sympathetic of all the master's por
traits. The famous "Flora" (Ufflzl) still
| retains, with all its sensuousness', some of
i the poetry of the past.
Titian soon substituted for the Glor
gionesque repose great- vehemence of
1 action and luxuriance of form. He shows
it in his Bacchanalian series for the Duke
: of Ferrara, especially in the superja "Bac
i chus and Ariadne" (National gallery), and
. in his great religious pictures, notably
I his great altar piece in the Bell' Arti, the
"Assumption of the Virgin" where action
runs riot. The rather theatrical tendency
: of these years (1518-30) is shown In his
painting. ""St. Sebastian" (1522). which
Titian himself regarded at the time as his
I masterpiece; it reached Its climax in his
i "Martyrdom of St. Peter Martyr" (1530),
which was quite universally thought to
i be his greatest picture, and the first In
stance where the human figures were
l made subordinate to the landscape.
In 1523 Titian secured a second powerful
patron. Federigo Gonzaga. Duke of Man
! tua, for whom he produced the masterly
"Entombment" (Louvre), the portraits of
; the Duke and Duchess, the superb "Bel
! la" (Pltti) and the "Venus" of the Ufflzl,
working steadily for the Duke until his
death in 1540. He increased his popularity
at home by the spectacular altar piece at
the Frarl (1525) called the "Madonna dl
i <'..<;} Pesaro."
In 1527 a new period in Titian's life and
I art commenced through his association
TITIAN. BY HIMSELF.
with the notorious Pietro Aretino, the
most corrupt man of a corrupt age, and
with all his high connections and wealth
the champion blackmailer of history.
During his stay In Venice, he found Ti
tian's talents useful and so helped him to
the favor of various Italian potentates,
and especially of Charles V of Spain. - Ti
tian was- perniciously and . permanently
affected by Aretino ln his art and charac
ter, learning to fawn on the great and to
worship money in a way unworthy of the
dignity of a great artist, and learning es
pecially to prostitute his art. During this
period of his middle life Titian painted
little more than . portraits, often flatter
ing, and alluring nudes for his princely
patrons. He showed himself willing to
paint without seeing his model, as in his
portrait of Francis 1., and to give to a
woman of 50 the semblance of SO, as In
the case of Eleanora Gonzaga. Prominent
at this time is his portrait of "Hyppolito
de Medici" il'ittii. when Titian's own ex
periences helped him to portray the un
scrupulous, cruel, shifty type. A worthy
mate to it is the portrait of "Pietro Are
tino" (Pltti) himself.
Ten years after the "St. Peter Martyr"
Titian produced another great religious
picture, the "Presentation of the Virgin
in the Temple," which In its harmonious
and spectacular composition served with
the "Ecce Homo" as a model to other
Venetian masters, such as Tintoretto, and
was never surpassed by them. The prince
ly house of Farneso succeeded (1542) the
Gonzagas as Titian's patrons, and as Pope
Paul 111 was a Farnese. Titian was thus
for the first time brought Into close con
nection with the papal court. The painter
finally, when nearly 70 years old, trav
eled beyond the limits of Northern Italy
and went to Rome. There he met the
Titian Michelangelo. The two artists rep
resented not merely an artistic opposition
of design versus colorâ but an opposition
of character. Michelangelo was typically
strong, independent, puritanic; Titian was
supple, fawning, luxurious. There could
be no sympathy or understanding. From
the earlier Florentine masters with whom
Titian then became a little better ac
quainted, he received something; at least.
it appears as if Verrocchio were not for
eign to his "John the Baptist" (Venice)
nor Raphael to his celling picture of
"Wisdom" (S. Marco), nor even Michelan
gelo to his "Adam and Eve" (Madrid), all
of which he painted after his visit to
Rome and Florence.
Not long after Titian made an even
greater Journey, to the court of Charles
V at Augsburg, where he painted one of
his most consummate masterpieces, the
equestrian portrait of "Charles V at the
Battle of Muhlberg" (Madrid). Titian had
now for several years reached the summit
of his ambitions. He was the favorite of
popes and emperors and reared no rival.
Yet he never ceased from nagging for
money and from sending unordered pic
tures In hopes of being well paid. After
the death of Charles V Titian was in high
favor with Philip 11. whom he had more
than once painted while he was yet prince.
Perhaps it was the influence of Spanish
fanaticism gradually creeping over him,
perhaps It was the advance of old age. but
whatever the reason may be we see Titian
gradually returning to religious scenes
and treating them with less- triviality and
less brutality. At the same time he does
not so often treat nude figures and myth
ological scenes. Aretino was dead; neo
cathollcism was supreme. The "Christ
Crowned With Thorns" (Munich) and the
"Pieta" (Venice. Bell' Arti), on which the
master was engaged at the time of his
death, are good examples of this kind of
pseudo-religious hysteria that formed
quite a lengthy prelude to his death in
1576. during the great plague.
The significance of Titian's art lies not
in drawing or composition, but In color
ing. His drawing was indifferent, though
Michelangelo regarded <t as defective. His
ability to compose, at first decidedly sec
ond-rate, became excellent, but his large
compositions never were his most char
acteristic piecesâ as â¢ compositions. Neith
er is Titian suggestive and inspiring in
the theme or the inner life of his pic
tures, as are so many other great Italian
artists. The delight he does give usâ
often but not alwaysâ ls almost purely
through the color sense; in the landscape,
the atmosphere, the combinations and
gradations of tone, the play of light, the
inwardness of color. Pie shows extreme
reticence for a Venetian in producing his

I. NEW WORDS AND HOW TO USE
THEM.
Keep a common writing pad on your
desk. When you hear a new word which
Interests you or when you come across
one In your reading jot it down. Take time
to look up Its meaning. Frame sentences
in which this word is used correctly. In
corporate it into your own vocabulary by
using it in your conversation the very
first chance you get, not in an affected
way, but as part of your everyday speech.
You must learn to distinguish between
words suitable for conversation and words
which are better adapted to the printed
page. Conversational speech has soul and
feeling. Written speech may be technical,
scientific, exact; the meaning Is conveyed
wholly by the words, while in conversation
the meaning is conveyed In part by the
gesture, the voice, and the personality of
the speaker. Take the following twelve
words for your first lesson and add a
dozen more of your own choosing during
the,' week:' â¢
Resumeâ This Is a French word which has
come Into common use. It Is pronounced ray
zsu-may. with accent upon tirst and last syl
lables. It means a summary, a summing, up.
a condensed account. We may say that a par
ticular magazine or paper gives a good resume
of current events.
Connoisseurâ Pronounced con-i-seur.' with the
accent upon the last syllable. A connoisseur
ls a critical judge, or rather a person who Is
competent to pass critical judgment upon any
thingl! The word Is most commonly used In
speaking of a person thoroughly competent to
pass judgment upon the work of son:., par
ticular department of art. A man who la mak
ing a specialty of collecting rare water colors
and who is considered from long experience
competent to pass upon a picture offered is
said, to be a connoisseur In water colors.
Altruisticâ This word is now very commonly
used. The noun Is altruism. It Is opposed to
selfishness. Any movement having for its chief
end the good of others may I"' termed al
truistic. Note this word in your newspaper
and magazine reading. You are- sure to meet
it.
Ghettoâ name Ghetto Is given to the pur:
of a city or town formerly set apart for tlv-
Jews. as In Rome or Frankfort-on-the-Rhlm
At present this name is a synonym for "Jew
is): quarter."
Radical â Measures are radical when they ai â¢
extreme or directly opposed to conventional
or commonplace methods. A man is radical
when he is the opposite of conservative in
his ideas and methods in political, religious
and social affairs. The radical breaks away
from all traditions and established customs.
Salonâ Pronounced sah-long. with the second
syllable accented. An apartment in which a
company is to receive: hence, [ a fashionable
reception or gathering. The name salon is
specifically applied to periodic social reunions
In Paris. The name ls also applied to the an
nual exhibition in Paris of works of living
artists.
' Bohemianâ A person, especially an artist or
literary man, who leads a free life, having
little regard to what society he frequents and
despising the conventional. One who prefers
adventure and speculation to settle, Industry
and who doeS net work well in the harness of
ordinary life. This word is pretty generally
used in America as the opposite of conven
tional. The bohemian's dress and habits and
dinners and pleasures are not always in har
mony with the rules or customs of society.
Personalityâ A man's personality Is that

by the square foot, square yard or square
mile. Solids are measured by the cubic

A foot of lumber is a solm containing
144 cubic inches. A piece of board a foot
square and an inch thick is said to be a
board foot. If cut Into four equal pieces
and these are placed on top of each other
so as to make a block 6 inches square and
4 inches thick it is still a board foot. To
find the solid contents of such a block we
multiply the length and breadth and

PLAY: LOVE'S LABOR'S LOST.
I.â Story of the Play.
The King of Navarre, "the sole Inheritor
of a.l perfections that a man may own,"
has made a vow that
"Tii: p.Ttnful study shrill outwear thre6 years.
Xo w--.n-.nn may approach hts silent court."
Three gentlemen of the King's court
have sworn that "for the three years'
term" they will "live with him as his fel
low-aehclars." One article of tho vow or
oath reads as follows:
"Item, If any man he â¢â en to talk with a
woman within the term of three years he shall
endure rucli public fihame as the rest of tlie
court can possibly devise."
Presently there comes to Navarre, In
tending to visit the court of the King, the
noble and beautiful Princess of France,
attended by threo noble and beautiful la
dies. The Princess is upon an embassy
for her father, the King of France, who is
oldj feeble ar.d 111.
1 he lying of Navarre and his three cour
tiers are dismayed. Tbey do not wish to
be unkmd, nor do they wish to deny them
selves the happiness of meeting those no
hie and beautiful ladies. And yet tbey do
net wish to bo forsworn ef their oath.
Finally, sinco necessity knows no law,
they agver to be forsworn of their oath
thin much:: They will meet the Princess
and her train witbout the precincts of the
court; "nut tho ladies are not to he ad
mitted within the precincts.
When fhe- :ne?t!ng takes place the King
red !:!s throe courtiers fail in love with
tbe Princess and her threo ladies, re
spectively. But for shame's sake they will
not confess their loves to one another, ln
the Â»nd, however, through a series of mis-

adventures, they become acquainted with I
their common predicament, and they
unite upon a common plan to obtain the
favor of their loved ones.
The Princess and her ladies also find ;
out about the gentlemen's predicament. ;
and determine to have some merriment 1
over the affair. So when the King and!
Ms courtiers. li the disguise of Musco- 1
vites; visit the Princess and her ladies, the
Princess and her ladies also disguise them
selves. The result is that every one of ihe
four gentlemen makes love to the wrong ;
lady.
When subsequently the . â  lemon visit
the ladies In their proper guise and again
declare their loves the ladies mercilessly
laugh at ih<Mii for their former blunders.
In the ond. however, the lovers are all ac- j
cepted, but only on condition of each do- i
ing a year's penance, as, for example, re
treating---

this not only because of the broken oaths,
but also to show that their lova is
lasting.

II. â A Neglected Comedy. i
"Love's Labor's Dost" Is 'haps the ;
least read of Shakespeare's comedies; and
f.tr this neglect it is easy to assign a rea
son. The play, probably Shakes] first
attempt at independent dramatic compos!
tion, is, on the surface at least, of a quite j
different character from his other come- I
dies. Willie these deal with the lasting
attributes of human nature and find their I
humor in the perennially ridiculous as- i
necta of man's character. "Dove's Dabor's
Dost" is a satiric fling at contemporary j
follies and provokes laughter by its cari- :
cature of figures and fashions well-known j
to its first hearers, but as forgotten to tho â¢
averafif: reader of to-day as the heroes '
wbo lived before Agamemnon. Just as i
"Patience" some years back swept over
England ar.d America In a peal of merry ;
mocking laughter; but has already passed
away into tne dark backward Ind abysm ;
of time; so this piay of Shakespeare's, i
which once set the pit of the Blackfriars |
theater roaring, and sweetly commended
itself to the fancy of good Queen Bess j
and the learning of wise King James, is j
now to aM intents dead past hope of re- I
surrection from the shelves of the library .
to ttie boards of the stage. 'Die allusions
to tlie fantastic Monarcbo, to tho dancing I
horse, to ihe last fashionable licentious j
poem, ali ring Mow to-day, and when I
Shakespeare's merry gentlemen belabor I
th* long-forgotten fashion of pedantic and |
affected speech, the reader Is Inclined to 1
cry with Armado: "The sweet war man ls i
dead ar.d rotten; sweet chucks, beat not 1
tbe bones of the dead." '.
And yet for the student of Shakespeare)
"Love's Labor's Lost" has a peculiar in
terest. It was the special favorite of the',
young Goethe and nis circle of Shakes- !
r-enre worshipers at Strasburg. : I iegel, I
the great champion of the romantic school j
In Germany, spoke of It as a model com- i
edy of the finest wit and the most de- {
lightful mirth. Nor has it been without 'â¢
honor In its own country. Coleridge says:
"If this juvenile drama had been the only j
one extant of our Shakespeare, and we i
possessed the tradition only' of his riper
works, how many of Shakespeare's char
acteristic features might we not still '
have discovered, though as in a portrait j
of him taken In his boyhood." Charles i
Lamb loved It as the comedy of 'leisure. I
"most nonsense, bost sense"; and Pater \
has devoted to !t one of the most ''harm
ing of hip charming appreciations.
lll. âHistory of the Play.
All critics agree that "Love's Labor's
Dost" Is one of the earliest of Shake- ;
speare's plays, and some of the highest
authorities rank It as his first Independ
ent work. General consent puts the date
of its composition somewhere between 1589
and U.W. We need not trouble ourselves |
about the exact year. When* we know
that wo have In "Dove's Labor's Lost" j
one cf the earliest. If not the very first, 1
of Shakespeare's â¢' lons In the field of
poetic comedy, we know enough.
The statement that it is one of Ms earl- I
lest creations applies, however. only to the j
first draft of "Love's Labor's Lost," and â¢
not to the drama as It lies before us to- I
day. On the title page of the first cdi- !
tion, a quarto, published in D'sS, we read: 1
"A Pleasant
Conceited Corned!*
Called
Loves labors ioÃt.
As lt was preaetsted before her Hlghnes
tnis last Chrletrras.
Newly ,'norrected and augmented
by W. Shakespeare."
"'Newly corrected and augmented"â for
when her gracious mates-. â¢â â¢ deigned to
cast the radiant beams' of her favor upon
the young dramatist, whose wit. pathos
end sentiment were packing the play
houses In the suburbs, and commanded j
a performance of bis popular dramatic j
satire for the entertainment of her court
on Christmas day, it was not for him to 1
I, resent ii in its first rough form. It must j
be retouched and decked out with such or
l.ar.ier.t cf rinsing verse as the author of |
"Uoir.eo and Juhet" and "The Merchant 1
of Venice" had at nis command. And 1
there wÂ«3 another reason. Among the
ladies of the court who would watch the
performance was a certain black-eyed
maid of honor whom Shakespeare loved,
and who had given im her bluest veins
lo kisp. He would write his love for her
into the play. court her by the mouth of
its here. Others might laugh over the
mn of the performance, the love which 1
lav l>o)o\v toe surface would be a secret
between them alone. But more of this
later.
It is not hard to discover some of the I
additions that Shakespeare made to the
play ln 1507. In two passages at least we
can see where the printer of the first edi
tion, working probably from a playhouse
copy interlined and with marginal read
ings, has struck off the old and the new
in one confused jumble. The lirst of these
is rowne's famous eulogy of love (act
IV, scene .1), the second Rosaline's Judg
ment on her lover (act V, scene 2). The
Inequality in length of the acts shows us
where the "augmentations" have been
made. The characters of Rosaline and
Berowne must have been strengthened,
and It is possible that the figure of tho
pedant schoolmaster was added as a com
panion piece to the pedant curate of the
first sketch.
IV.â Points of Special Interest.
In spile of what has been said above as I
i to the comparative lack of interest of
this lay for the general reader, there are >
few comedies of Shakespeare that will
' bettor repay a close and sympathetic
: study than "Love's Labor's Lost. It Ss
'. a play of beginnings, and we may see in
1 it the art of Shakespeare In the germ, or
rather in a bud just unfolding, sweet In
; itself, and full of glorious promise. It is
; a play of youth; the young King, the
! young Princess, the young amorous lords j
and ladies dominate the scenes. And in â¢
; the flash and parry of the weapons of |
i young wit we catch the mind of the young i
1 poet. And it Is a play In which the per
| sonallty of the author shines out through
I the thin veil of the hero, and we see, if
i not exactly Shakespeare himself, Shakes
â  pi ire as he wished himself to appear in
: the eyes of his mistress.
! V. Shakespeare's Art in the Play.
The dramatic art shown in the con
struction of the plot is of the vers* slight
est. The story, drawn no one knows
whence, Is a mere pep on which to hang
a spangled robe of wit and poetry. A
King of Navarro decides to turn his court
into a little academe. Ho and his followers
tate vows to study hard, to sleep little,
to fast often and above all to shun the
society of women, in order that they may
drink deep uf the delights of learning and
earn In their lives the fame that shall
live registered upon their brazen tombs."
But the best laid schemes, even of a stu
dious king and his bookmatds, jtang aft
agley. A I'rincess of France comes upon
the scene with her ladies, as an ambassa
dress from her old father. Of mere ne
cessity the late made vows are broken.
The King and his lords enter into parley
with the Princess and her ladies, and no
sooner enter Into parley than thoy fall in
love, and no socner fall in love than they
begin to woo their mistresses. The ladles,
not ignorant of the vows rashly made and
quickly broken, repay their court with
merry scorn, till at the close a graver note
strikes across the silver laughter, as a
messenger announces thi death of the
King of France. The Princess retires to
a year's sojourn in a mourning bouse, and
for a twelve months' space the lovers i
must wait for their answer. "Our wooing
doth not end like an old play,'' says the
Irrepressible Berowne, with half a sigh i
for tho penalty assigned him. "Jack hath
not Jill." And so for the year at least,
love's labor's lost. Could any plot be
lighter, slighter, brighter!
Even In the character drawing we see
the 'prentice hand, not without promise '
indeed of greater things to come, but still
the 'prentice hand. Tho King and the !
Princess are graceful, but shadowy fig
ures. There is not a hair, to choose be- ;
tween Longaville and Dumain, or between
Katherine and Maria. Even the humorous I
persons of the play Armado, Holofernes, :
Costardâ follow along lines strictly laid'
down in the old comedyâ the Braggart,
the Pedant and the Clownâ as indeed they I
are sometimes called In th.- first edition".
But if any one wishes to see how much
of the wine of wit Shakespeare has pour
ed Into these old bottles, one has but to
compare Armado with his prototype, Sir \
Tophas, in Lilly's "Endymion." Only in
the figures of Berowne and Rosaline, i
where the 'prentice hand has been rein- j
forced by the master's touch, do we feel
ourselves In the presence of a pair of j

GREAT AMERICAN STATESMEN.
I. SAMUEL ADAMS.
BY BERNARD C. STEIXER, PH. D.
To no one does the cause of American
independence owe more than to this man
who with invincible persistence and
shrewd far-sightedness so conducted the
cause of those among the colonists who
opposed the taxation of Americans by the
British Parliament that a majority of all
the British subjects in each colony were
willing to unite in declaring their inde
pendence from all foreign rule. He was a
typical puritan, upright, firm, determined,
religious, devoted to his cause, somewhat
narrow, but with the narrowness of the
sharp-edged sword. He was above all else
a politicianâ a professional and practical
politician. His early ventures in business
were unsuccessful. His malt house was
soon closed, his tax collect'orshlp life him
involved In debt, and. living on the email
remains of his father's estate, he devoted
the remainder of his days to political life.
Adams was of unblemished integrity. His
means were so narrow that his frugal and
devoted wife was at times called upon to
aid in the support of the family and he
was indebted to friends for the clothes he
wore, vet no temptation to amass wealth
touched him. He was above bribery or
influence by money. Adams was a
faithful son of Massachusetts and Boston.
Until he went to the continental Congress
In 1774 he seems never to have left his na
tive State, nor indeed to have ever gone
any distance from his residence. Except
for his journeys to attend ' the various
congresses of which he was a member,
he seems never to have gone from home.
Others might hold foreign embassies; for
him Boston was all sufficient. In Boston
his influence was lons supreme. The roy
alist Governor of Massachusetts rightly
called him "the grand, incendiary of the
province," for the whole of Massachusetts
was set on fire by the Boston town meet
ing and the moderator and master of that
meeting was Samuel Adams. He did not
enter into public life early, but from 1705,
when he was first elected as a represent
ative from Boston to the great and gen
erai court, to 1797, when he resigned the
Governorship of the State, his whole time
was devoted to the service of the people,
lt was noted that be cared not to discuss
social, scientific or religious matters with
friends; all his thoughts were on politics,
and ln old age his favorite theme was the
struggle with Great Britain, in which he
had borne so great a part. Upright him
self, he insisted on civic virtu.- and strove
to draw promising and able young men
into public service. His kinsman, John
Adams, and John Hancock, whose wealth
and social position were of great value
to the colonists, were two of those he in
troduced into politics.
Through a long career we find but little
to criticise in his actions from a moral
point of view. He was doubtless somewhat
disingenuous In his treatment of the let
ters of Governor Hutchinson and in some
of his arguments, but the wonder is rather
that in the heat of controversy he was
swayed so little from the path of abso
lute rectitude.
He cared not for personal advancement
and seemed to feel little bitterness when
the people set him aside for a time. Adams
trusted the people and believed that their
decisions as to men were right. To in
fluence these decisions as to measures he
applied himself with the utmost vigor.
He was born ln 1722, and educated at
Harvard College, where he took his
bachelor's degree in 1740, and his master's
degree in 1743. It was afterward remem
bered, as a presage of his future, that his
master's thesis was an affirmative answer
to the question "Whether it be lawful to
resist the supreme magistrate, if the com
monwealth cannot be otherwise pre
served." â¢
When 26 years of age he began furnish
ing to the newspapers the first of those
long series of articles on government
which had so much effect. His style of
writing was clear and Incisive, his argu
ments were forcible and logical. Adams
used few mataphors and quotations, his
writings were not graceful, but they were
never dull and were always convincing.
In these first essays we .find the same
ideas expressed as he statad again and
again in later years: "Whoever acquaints
us that we have no right to examine Into
the conduct of those who, though they
derive their power from us to serve the
common Interests, make use of it to im
poverish and ruin us, is ln a degree a
rebelâ to the undoubted rights and liber
ties of the people. He that leaves no
stone unturned to defend and propagate
the schemes of illegal power cannot be es
teemed a loyal man."
Adams always took a deep interest in
popular education, and his first public
oflice was that of school visitor, to which
he was appointed in 1703. His whole course
of effort against Great Britain was what
we would call a "campaign of education."
tie appealed chiefly to the intellects of his
fellow-citizens, though he was too skill
ful to omit altogether the appeal to emo â¢
tions. When the stamp act showed the
policy of Great Britain toward America
he drafted his first public paper, a series
of instructions to their representatives,
adopted by the Boston town meeting on
May 24, 1764. He stood steadfastly for the
principle of no taxation without repre
sentation, and, unlike Otis discerned from
the first that representation of any sort
ln the British Parliament was Impracti
cable. In these early resolutions he
claims that the stamp tax "annihilates
our charter rights to govern and tax our
selves. It strikes at our British privi
leges, which, as we have never forfeited
them, we hold in common with our fellow
subjects who are natives of Britain.- If
taxes are laid upon us in any shape, with
out our having a legal representation
where they are laid, we are reduced from
the character of subjects to the miserable
state of tributary slaves." Adams ad
vanced from this position so as to main
tain, In 1773, that Parliament had no right
to legislate for the colonies in America
The attempt of the British to seize him
and Hancock Just before the battle of
Lexington was not a mistaken one. He
had been the very forefront of opposition
Governor Bernard had found him an in
vincible opponent. Governor Hutchinson
had succeeded no better, though he had
been born and brought up In Massachu
setts, and Governor Gage was shortly to
be driven from Boston because of " the
activity of the colonists which Adams
had aroused. His kinsman, John Adams
said of him: "The talents of that great
man were of the most exalted, though not
of the most showy kind. Love of country,
his exertions in her service through a long
course of years â¢ * * under the royal
government and through the whole of the
subsequent revolution and always in sup
port of tho same principlesâ his inflexible
integrity, his disinterestedness, his invarl
ble resolution, his sagacity, his patience,
j perseverance and pure public virtue were
: nexer exceeded by any man ln America."
Adams was prudent enough to see from
â  the very first that Boston alone or even
the whole of Massachusetts, could not en
dure successfully the burden of the strug
gle with England. To secure even the
hope of success the co-operation of all the
i other colonies was necessary. In the res
i olutions of 1764, to which wo have refer
red, the. Necessity of united effort is stated
thus: "As his majesty's other North
American colonies are embarked with us
in this most Important bottom, we further
desire you to use your endeavors that
their weight may be added to that of this
province that, by the united application
of all who are aggrieved, all may obtain
redress." This Insistence on the Import
i ance of united action was never lost by
â¢ Adams. He continued to struggle for it.
i In 1788 he Induced the Legislature to send
i a circular letter to the other colonies.
Massachusetts was the chief offender, but
i she struggled for a principle whose im-
SAMUEL ADAMS.
I portance was equal to all the colonies. We
j must never think of the colonies as actu- '
i ally suffering from oppression, though the
â  strong language of their documents often
; state that as a fact. What Adams strug
gled against was the validity of a doctrine
Which would make oppression possible. In
that struggle he often thought that In this '
time of common distress it would be the
wisdom of the colonists more frequently '
to correspond with and to be more atten
tive to the particular circumstances of
each other. "It seems of late to havo*
been the policy of the enemies of America
to point their artillery against one prov
ince only and artfully to draw off the at
| tention of the other colonies, and. If pos
â  slide, to render that single province odious i
to them, while it Is Buffering ministerial i
vengeance for the sake of the common I
cause. But it Is to be hoped that the colo
nists will be aware of this artifice. At this
juncture an attempt to subdue one prov- *
Ince to despotic power is justly to be con- ;
sid< red as an attempt to enslave the i
whole. The colonies form one political
body of which each is a member. The
liberties of the whole are invaded, there
fore, the Interest of the whole to support
each individual with all their weight and
j influence."
I As the clouds thickened his masterly re- I
; sistance to the ill-judged British policy !
was continued and the skill -with which
' he managed the colonial cause, keeping !
I within constitutional measures, was clear- I
)ly shown. His newspaper articles, pub- I
j lished as was the custom of the day un
[ dei some such norn de plume as "Can
! dlde," did much to crystallize the opposi- j
tion. His descendant and biographer, j
Wells, rightly calls him "the true father I
j of Democracy in America, whose voice j
I and pen were employed for the common |
! people; and he labored to build up Amer
lean liberty, not only by public measures,
but by cultivating an Individual inde
pendence of thought among the working
classes, as the true basis of national free
dom." So successful was he in his con
trol of the people and so did he wield his
I power that in 1770 Hutchinson was obliged
' to withdraw from town to the fort in the
harbor the two British regiments, who
had been engaged In that unfortunate af- '
j fray known as the Boston massacre. In
, the same year, through his influence, the
Assembly appointed a committee of cor
respondence "to communicate such intel
ligence as may be necessary to the agent
and others in Great Britain and also to
â¢ the speakers of the several Assemblies
i through the continent, or to such com- !
1 mittee of correspondence as they have or
may appoint. This Idea was still further
carried out by the more famous resolu- i
tion of the town of Boston In November I
! 1772, appointing a like committee to "state 1
the rights of the colonists, and of this j
I province in particular, as men and Chris- i
â  tians and subjects, and to communicate i
. publicly the same to the several towns 'â 
and to the world, as the sense of this
1 town, with the Infringements and viola
; tions thereof that have been or from time
,to time may be made." So strong was his
longing for confederation of all America
that he always sought to include Canada
In tho continental combination.
The destruction of the tea in Boston
; harbor was managed by Adams, and
I when the port bill closed that harbor
Adams acted as the chairman of the com
'â  mittee. to distribute the donations which
I came so generously from the other
States. He was chosen a member of the
First Continental Congress, and served in
that body for seven years, or nearly until
, the end of the war. Earliest of all the
I colonists he longed for Independence and
, at one time, discouraged by the slow prog
ress of the other colonies toward the ac
ceptance of that idea, he thought of a

HOME SCIENCE AND
HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY.
I. THE HOME CONSTRUCTION.
BY HELEN CAMPBELL.
If men lived like men Indeed, their houses
would be temples, which we should hardly dare !
injure, and in which lt would make us holy to
be permitted to live. â¢ â¢ * 1 would have, then,
our ordinary dwelling houses built to iast. and
built to be lovely, as right and full of pleasant- j
ness as may be. within and without, and with
such differences as might express each .man's
character and occupation and partly his his
tory.
In our American life, with its perpetual j
grasp for something better than its past ,
has known, each man may be said to \
build a house to escape from rather than
to record his history. The majority pre
fer not to look backward, and the new
house enshrines no memory of the early
days of its owner, which may have been
in dugout or log cabin or in one of the
uncompromisingly hideous little boxes
thai make the suburbs of many cities.
But Ruskin, whose words open this pa
per, is, as usual, right In his demand that
the house of man shall be something it
seldom occurs to us to make itâ temple
wherein ordered and harmonious growth
may be a part of the daily life. The house
should be the best and utmost expression
of the home spirit; the best adaptation of
means to ends; the utmost convenience |
and comfort for all under its roof; the i
greatest ease in necessary work; the best |
space for individual as well as family life. <
i How is this to be brought about? The |
! plan is left to the general builder, the i
[ contractor, whose business It Is to make !
as much show for the money spent as |
brain can contrive, and to skimp and j
curtail in whatever is out of sight. Cheap j
building houses "made to sell" are the
first consideration. Houses made to last
and to improve with age have not yet en
tered our thought of construction.
At this point we see, then, certain
needs defining themselves, and we may
well group them under their distinct
heads. We are to consider
a. The Individual plan.
b. (Jen, sanitary aspects.
c. Materials and their handling.
d. Construction and its ethics.
In the limited space at command only
suggestions under each head can be given,
but it is hoped that the reader will gain
from them some new thought as to the
real nature of building and what it may
stand for in every human life. We have
tirst to consider, then,
The Individual Plan.
It will at once be insisted that there
can be no need of this, in face of the fact
that we have many books, large and
small, all devoted to the plans for all
sorts and conditions of men and their
dwelling places. There are admirable ones
to be mentioned, but this does not affect
ln the slightest the discovery made by all
who buy a house that they would have
built it quite otherwise at certainly one,
and it may be many points. It is but
very recently that the architects' confer
â¢ ence in one of our great cities brought
from one prominent member a recom
i mendation that they turn their attention
to the architecture of farm houses, and
'a better future thereby for the farmer's
wife and children, at present compelled
to live in structures of a hideousness cal
culated to kill out the sense of beauty as
thoroughly as we find it killed out in the
mass of our people.
This is one phase, and It applies to
workmen's houses of all degrees. An-
I other and quite as Important one is thai
according to the different pursuits of the
family should be the type of room of- j
fered them. A pair Just beginning life â ,
together may take the average flat or
small house. But presently, with chil
dren and their needs to consider, it is
found that the nursery, or the living room :
which must perhaps serve this purpose,
has no sun and thus is made unfit for the J
i growing child, whose birthright is sun
i shine and the strength and healing it j
I means for all. With the departure of the
old-fashioned garret, one playground for
the childâ an invaluable one, since It gave
loom for infinite "make-believe"van
ished also.- Yet the child should have its
I own play spot sacred from interference,
; preferably as remote from the other j
rooms as possible, that his noise on rainy j
! days may not interfere with others; a
place for collections of all orders, for
' toys and books and the tools the child |
j loves to use, and which are part of the
I training in use of hand and brain to- ;
> gether that presently we are all to know j
; is the first essential of education.
All this is to be planned for, and lt is I
often possible to modify or alter the for- I
mal plan of the architect and secure this
space. But the least skilled draughtsman
can take pencil and paper, think out the
: family needs as they have demonstrated
! themselves, and see first how to make a
j rough plan; then how to make the avail
able space tell to the utmost for family
comfort. No matter how small the sum,
â¢ it will be better to do without a formal
parlor, we will say, have a living room
! ample and generous, and put the money
: saved into deadened floors and the best
finish. This matter of deadening floors is
: seldom thought about, yet for the most
i nervous people in Christendom it is es
i sential. We all know the houses where
every sound is heard throughout, and no
\ escape for tired mother, for ailing baby,
| for the invalid, If there be one. or. the
patient who wants only quiet and rest to
come to strength speedily. In our sound
ing-board houses this form of cure is im
! possible, but it need not be. Plan, then,
j to these ends, and see If there is not in
stant gain in the conception of the mean
i ing of a house and what it is to stand for >
i in the family life.
General Sanitary Aspects.
This heading means a volume. To un
derstand it fully there should be some
very earnest study, and the books best
adapted to this end are named in the lit
tle bibliography accompanying this paper.
; The shortest, most compact and most
practical Is a manual prepared under the
direction of one of the aides! of American
women, Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, profes
sor of chemistry in the Boston Institute
of Technology.- "Home Sanitation" is its
title, and it covers the ground for both
1 city and country as to the situation of the
; house, Its drainage and plumbing, its yen
, tilation, heating and lighting, a set of
1 questions at the end of each delightfully
i queer little chapter clinching all doubtful
points. There are many elaborate manu
als, but this and one or two others cover
all the ground and must be thoroughly
learned. A dry and well-drained soil, a
house planned for as much sunshine as
possible in every room, and perfect drain-
I age are the requisites for even the sim-
I plest dwelling. In the city the size of the
; lot determines much. In the country it
I can always be remembered that it is by
â¢ no means necessary to face the street,
; and that turning the house door to the
i side may give the sun Impossible from the
i front. Storerooms are better on the north
! side for coolness, and the spare room,
! used less probably than any other, can
much better dispense with sun than those
I In constant use. A little thought over the
: general plan will settle many questions of
this nature.
Materials and Their Handling.
This is a matter supposed usually to be
j quite beyond the comprehension of
women. Yet every woman can in a short
\ time learn the difference between good
j and bad mortar, between seasoned and un
seasoned wood, between well-laid courses
of brick and the makeshift which marks
much of the cheap building* She can learn
i also what constitutes a good cellar and
good foundation, and how a cellar floor
should be made, with the virtue of cc
', ment and the value of smooth cellar
. walls. These are all phases of home sani
tation, and honest materials honestly put
I together are an equal part of it. Crocking
walls, settling and uneven floors, base
i boards shrinking away and doors sagging
1 are all part of lack of knowledge or lack
â¢ of honesty on the builder's part. We are
i a hasty people and kiln-dry our wood,
i with no thought of the consequence. And
we are wedded to wood when all about is
another material, more beautiful, more
; durable and in many places less costly.
Common "rubble." the loose stone of the
! neighborhood, put together with good
j mortar and a course of brick here and
j there, over windows, doors, etc., as fin
ish, will make a house beautiful to look
! at, beloved of all climuing vihes, and pic
i turesque under all conditions. Or there
! may be a story of rubble and brick and
i the upper portion finished in wood. But
more and more architectsâ the thinking
| onesâ urge the adoption of stone and
1 brick and give models within even very
| narrow means.
Construction and Its Ethics.
Practically this Is in great part included
in the heading "Materials." But there is
another point seldom thought of in the
matter of flimsy or substantial structure,
and that is the educational effect of hon
est workmanship, whether In house or its
finish and furnishing. The day for gin
gerbread work in house finish, the cheao
and most unheautiful production of the
jigsaw, is fast passing. Sanitation, is
teaching us that smooth surfaces are not
only more healthful, since they give no
lodgment to bacteria, but are also more
beautiful. Veneers, save where wood a
i of so costly an order that it must so be
used or not at all, are also out of date.
But we still put cheap finish whenever we
can, covering half-mixed mortar in walls
with gay papers and making all out of
: sight construction of the poorest quality
i of wood. Our public buildings share often
the same fate because the sort of con
i science that would not admit poor con
[ struction is not yet part of our teaching.
These things are, when we are a little
j wiser, to be a necessity in all education,
j and when that good day comes even our
I politicians will have been so drilled in
! what constitutes honest building that we
shall have a new order of homes and of
public buildings.
11. THE HOME ENVIRONMENT.
Here again we have the possibilities of
a volume in our title, but being held rig
idly to the limits of a column or two can
only outline certain points that bear upon
all homes, whether rich or poor, In city
or country. Four phases present them
selves;
a. A new thought about building.
b. Possibilities of a back yard.
c. Building for privacy.
d. A uew phase of factory work for the home.
This question of the home environment
is. like all the rest that bear upon ways
nt living, made easy or difficult by the
depth of the purse. But for the rich or
those of moderate purse must be first of :
I all some sense of beauty and fitness, or
â¢ the story of their lack will be plain to i
read in every lino of the building and jts |
surroundings. The country home should :
seem to have grown naturally in the spot
[ where we find it, even if set close among
| its neighbors. The city house is limited
in expression by the narrow space upon
which it stands; yet even this, as we j
shall presently see, is capable of different !
treatment, and is already receiving it.
But for every town and village that has
come to the sense of beauty sufficiently to
desire the best arrangement and planning :
a harmonious whole, it is still possible to
reconstruct at least a part of the space \
occupied. The time is nearing when the
smallest settlement will be subject to
laws laid down by competent authorities,
and every house will be planned with re i
lation to its effect to the whole. Now
and from the beginning it has all been
chance work, and the thought of a gen
eral unity of plan and effect absolutely
unknown. Ppblic buildings have been at
the mercy of mere contractors, and each
town has been a mere jumble of incoher
ences. A change in this respect means a
change in the whole handling of every
phase of building; the growth of the civic
sense and of that sense of a common obli
gation to make the most and best of every
oportunity for larger, happier living. To
this end a group of friends who propose
building could easily take counsel to
gether, pool their resources, employ a
thinking architect and start in with a
definite conception of what plan of plant
ing and building would produce the best
results. The very fact of having begun
with this united purpose would give a
different expression to the whole. As we
do and always have done, a town, even
with the best natural advantages, fails to
show them to real advantage. The
wealthier people are planted In the best
places, and when it is presently discov
ered that parks and boulevards and free
access to a lake or river, for Instance, are
public needs, every desirable foot of â 
ground has already been appropriated and
everybody wonders why nobody thought ;
about it In the beginning;.
Some thought and plan, then, is what !
all must take with them who make a
country home. Suppose, however, that
one must live in a block? Even then we
are by no means so helpless as we have
believed. The great apartment houses
have shown us how much comfort can be
increased by the lessening of labor, a
common heating apparatus and plumbing
system doing away at once with some of
the heaviest labor of the private home,
the care of the fire and all the dirt and
trouble of coal and ashes. A well-known
Brooklyn builder, Alfred White, who put
up the first model tenement houses, has
since built a block of small houses, the
first one in this country, about an open
j court with fountains, trees and shrubs.
â¢ No millionaire's house has more perfect
i finish, and building an entire block at
\ once the expense for each house was so
i reduced as to enable the landlord to rent
i them for less than the same sum charged
I for individual houses. On a small city
lot there seems no chance for change.

HOW TO STUDY SHAKESPEARE.
(Continued From Column Three, Page One.)
he gives an illuminative decision ("Win
ter's Tale," IV, iv, 89 ff.):
Nature Is
Made better by no mean.
But nature makes that mean; so over that art
Which you say adds to nature is an art
That nature makes.
This is an art
Which does mend nature, change It rather, Dut
The art itself is nature.
Finally, when he speaks of "the elegancy,
facility and golden cadence of poesy â¢ .Â£ a
has at once named the trait by which the
unlettered most- reaclilv recognize it, and
the quantity of which" the greatest mas
ters are the quickest to appreciate tho
charm. Shakespeare studied nature but
ho labored at an art. and the measure or
his success In touching the hearts of men
is the perfection which his art attained.
So we may, if we will, begin by looking
in Shakespeare for these six things. We
may see how he loves, and studies, and re
veals man In brutesâtho human soul in
a human bodyâ in a world which thwarts,
perplexes, amuses or inspires him, and
amid other human beings from whom he
Is strikingly dissimilar, and with whom he
is essential akin. Then we may observe
how Shakespeare never persistently and
ultimately misleads us, but always gives
us ample materials"for deciding upon the
true moral rank of each of his Important
characters. We may perceive how he is
interested to uphold the moral order of
the world, as revealed In social and polit
ical institutions, and how he lashes those
who are guilty of any attempt to subvert
this moral order, while he bestows honors
with a lavish hand upon those who are
concerned in maintaining it. We shall
then discover, on closer inspection, that
the dramatist has but slight sympathy
with other worldliriess, - with the spirit
that, regarding man as a stranger and pil
grim on the earth, deliberately sets its af
fection on things above. Next, we may
follow his pencil as, with vigorous or ten
der touches, it paints for us the appear
ance and effects of objects in the world of
sense, rarely giving us an object alone,
but associating them In groups or uniting
them by reciprocal action and influence,
as he does with his human beings. When
we have begun all this we may at length
study Shakespeare's views concerning the
wonderful art by which he was enabled
to perform these marvels, and investigate
the means by which they were actually
brought to pass. - :

color effects, not forcing the note, not
making a flaunting display of technical
mastery, nor seeking vivid contrasts. He
is sober and harmonious, tending more
and more, as he advances in years, to
ward a single color note, flooding the sur
face with light and obliterating outlines.
This makes him at last quite an impres
sionist, so that to appreciate many of his
late pictures it is necessary to obtain the
right distance and focus before the proper
effect of color and form can be under
stood. At close quarters they seem blur
red and careless.
But beyond the wonderful coloring
which so often gives just the intoxication
of a Venetian evening there was undoubt
edly a vivid power of characterization in
Titian's art, whether his portraits have
the clear outlines of the "Young Man
With the Glove" or are impressionistic
like the "Antiquary Strada." If the mas
ter's art is perplexing in its variety of
stages, it is due to his long life and the
changes In contemporary art; if it is un
even in its quality it is, because his lax
ity was not proof against the temptation
of pot boilersâ and for this his age was
more to blame than he was. Certainly
the fact that his nature was impressiona
ble has made him a radiant reflection of
the sensuous life of the late Venetian
renaissance to a degree that would have
been impossible to a more self-poised or
solitary genius.
