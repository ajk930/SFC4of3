LONDON. Aug. 21.â The Colonial Office, in confirmation of the dispatch
from Gape Town saying the Transvaal Government had handed its
reply to the British agent .1; Pretoria, says that Sir Alfred Mjlrier has
I 4 telegraphed a message to that effect. All the officials of the Colonial
Office would say in regard to the matter is "the reply is not a com
plete acceptance of the proposal of Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of the Col
. There is no; linger any doubt that President Krugei has refused to sub
mit to the demand of Mr. Chamberlain for the a; ointment of a court of
inquiry. He may have done so diplomatically or hedgingly. but that his
answer is regarded by the British Government as tantamount to positive
refusal is. now an established fact. The Colonial Office is noncommittal,
but there are other evidences which amply justify the statement. The
report that President Kruger has proposed new terms is somewhat verified
by the guarded- comment of the Colonial Office officials and the irritability
â â¢â I there.
There is not the slightest doubt that they now believe war is the only
way to settle the controversy. ThÂ«y would far rather have had a curt, de
fiant answer than the temporizing answer which the Boer President has
sent. With the former Great Britain would have plain grounds for a
quick cunMTienc^ment of hostilities. Under the circumstances which it is
believed npw exist aggressive action needs considerable explanation to Jus

A high official pressed his disgust at which he termed â¢Kruser's cv-

This Transvaal question cannot bÂ« judged by recent ocourronces. You
must go back fifty years. It has bÂ«en hanging fire all that timÂ» and th"
sooner it is settled now the better."
Though the official did not actually say so, it was clear that he believed
war was the only method of settlement.
It is learned that the Government is somewhat annoyed at the public's
slight interest in the Transvaal.' The official above quoted said:
"Dreyfus seems the only thin-; (.hat our people think about, though
Engfland is in a most serious crish*. This indifference is perhaps "vpical."
A special dispatch from <";:;â  Town says there is great danger of an
outbreak of violence on the frontier and that the scum of South Africa is
enlisting throughout the Colony and is being sent to Pitsana and Jameson
on the border.
CAPE TOWN. Aug. According to Afrikander reports, the Trans
vaal's reply is a counter proposal of a five years' retrospective franchise
in the election of the President and an increased representation. It is said
that thÂ« suggestion is made to submit all other differences to arbitration.
BERLIN. Aug. 21.â The Neueste Nachrichten publishes tl.e following
dispatch from Pretoria: "President Kruger a few days ago personally con
ducted a church service prior to holding an official reception. In the course
of the ceremony he prayed that if war were unav '.able God might find
right and truth on the side of the Afrikanders."

FAURE AND HIS COHORTS

PARIS, Aug. 21.â Tn consequence nf yesterday's events judicial pro- "
ceedings have been instituted against Sebastian Faure and four others "
for rebellion, acts of violence and attempts to murder, and against divers -
persons for robbing a building and burning its furniture; also for -
breaking windows and inciting to riotous assemblage. A judicial inves- -
tigation will be had before Magistrate de Valles.
A member of the anti-Semite League says that M. Guerin has three

The papers of this city, in com

in pronouncing the situation to be

the Government has decided to act

KAISER FACES
CABINET CRISIS
Headed by Prince Hohenlohe, the
German Ministry Sends In Its
Resignation*
JT)ERLIX, Aug. 21. â A Cabinet meeting was held this -after-
J_J noon at the residence of Prince Hohenlohe. The Imperial
Chancellor and the whole Cabinet agreed to resign. The
acceptance of the Ministry's resignation is uncertain.
Emperor William will return to Berlin on Wednesday, when,
it is reported, he wUI preside at the Cabinet council and decide
what steps are to be taken.
All kinds of rumors are aitoat. One paper asserts that, the
Kaiser has accepted the resignation of the zvhole Cabinet. Others
are of the opinion that the fall cf Dr. yon Miquel will entail the fall
of Prince Hohenlohe also, but nothing will be definitely known until
the Emperor arrives. 'The newspapers are still actively continent
ing upon the difficulties of the situation.

moned by the Kaiser on Saturday immediately after the rejection of the
canal bills, and. it is believed, was intrusted to begin a vigorous anti-
American campaign. The probable dissolution of the Diet as a result of
the defeat of the canal bill is much talked of. The Conservatives are-mov
ing heaven and earth to prevent this. It is said that even now Dr. Miquel
is trying to patch up the conflict between the Conservatives, pointing out
to both that only the socialists and the social Democrats can benefit by an
open rupture.
To-day's action has caused a big sensation, and it is believed to; indi

SAN JOSE, Aug. 21.â There is a proba

of Santa Clara within the next two years.
I The matter is now being considered by the
Jesuit Fathers, and it is stated that on
j its golden jubilee the college will certainly

Two places are being consideredâ one
mar Mountain View and the other at
i Leonards. Santa Cruz County. The latter
I locality is the favorite. At Leonards the
I Jesuit Fathers own 160 acres of land,
much of which is improved: It is most
delightfully situated near Aptos, and part
of the property faces on the bay at Santa
Cruz It has a magnificent beach and is
one of the 6oesi sites fox- n collate in th*
State. The climate as -fine- and the- beach

GREWSOME FIND OF A
PARTY OF CAMPERS
Saw a Child's Body Floating Down
Stream, But Could Not
Secure It.
REDDING. Aug. 21.â A story comos
from Fall River Valley to the effect that
Amasa Dollarhide and sum*' <arnpers.
while fishing on Pitt River, discovered
the body or a boy Moating down stream.
They describe the corpse as that of a
child some 6 or 7 years of age. dressed
In a white waist and dark colored knee
trousers. They made every effort to se
cure the body, but having neither rope. I
boat or any other appliances, they were
unsu:*cfssful. though they say that atone ]
tim.- they could almost reach it.
They followed the body for about half
a mile, down thf canyon, till they came to
a large eddy. and thinking the body would
remain there for some time they hurried j
back to town to get ropes, but when they
returned to the place the body had dis
appeared and has not since been seen.
Quite a number of men wont out from
town and searched along the river until
dark but their efforts amounted to noth- '
Ing. ' Tho parties who saw the body are j
not able to say whether it was a white
child or an Indian. The face was dark
and badly swollen and bruised, probably ;
from contact with rocks and snags in the
stream. The mystery is deepened by the ;
fact lhat no child. Indian or white, has :
been reported missing. The dress of the
child would indicate that it was not an |
Indian. The witnesses are highly re-
Bpectable, and the incident has attracted |
a great deal of attention.

' Chelan. eighty-five miles below Horseshoe
Basin. The accident happened in a black
: smith shop, which Cameron entered with
i a bux of caps while White was working at
the anvil. Sparks fell among the caps,
setting them off. This caused an explo
sion of dynamite near by. The blacksmith
shop was blown to atoms and the men in
side were thrown in opposite directions.
Cameron was picked up nearly dead,
- pieces of timber and metal being found
sticking Into the upper part of his body.
i One eye was blown out and a piece of
i wood several inches long was pulled out
of a large hole in his left side. A mes
i senger was sent to Stehekin. at the head
lof Lake Chelan. and a special steamer
was chartered to go to Lakeside, sixty
', miles away, for a doctor and nurse. These
will arrive at Horseshoe Basin to-morrow

of a political nature not relating to the business which took him to

W. J. Bryan was hilled to speak in Omaha on Saturday evening.
This fact led Mr. Schurman to inquire about Mr. Bryan's prospects for
a renomination for the Presidency, He was anxious to know the at

1900.
It is well known that Admiral George Dewey is a member of the com
mission of which Mr. Schurman was chairman. Upon the latter's ar
rfval at Manila the two men were in almost daily consultation. Mr.
BcJrurman saic] to Mr. Rosewater that William R. Hearst, proprietor of
th" W-w V' lie Journal, dispatched James Oreelman to Manila to tender
to Admiral George Dewey the backing of thf Journal and the unlimited
financial backing of Mr. 1 Hearst if the admiral would consent to the
use of his name as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency.
Mr. Schurman said Admiral Dewey declined the tender and asserted
what has already been wired to this country â that he had no political
aspirations.
Mr. Hearst's suppont of Mr. Bryan in 1596 is a matter of record.
He flaunted the free silver candidate in the faces of the old school
sound-money Democrats of New York and staked tho reputation of his
newspaper on the Chicago convention. The fact that he contemplates
the candidacy of another man for 1900 is significant as indicating the tem
per of Democrats in New York.
Admiral Dewey told Mr. Schurman of Mr. Hearst's tender.
gumentativeiy, in a calm voice, to the
| various points raised by the witrâss^s.
, It was in response to Captain .Tunck
that he made his longest statement, oc
cupying about ton minutes, during
which he us-.-il the notes he had taken
while Junck was sÂ»eaking, and with
methodical arrangement of facts and in
unequivocal langauge effectively dis
cussed !he inaccuracies of Junck's tes
| timony. The prisoner punctuated his
remarks with moderate, well-chosen
ires of his right hand, standing
erect, facing his Judges and holding
i his gold braided kepi in his left hand.
The third point, the conduct of Junck
in repeating confidences made to him as
a comrade, by Dreyfus, disgusted his
hearers, and in the mind of any right
thinking man must have considerably
impaired the value of the remainder of
his evidence. He and Dreyfus sat to
gether in the same c.-fFiee and naturally
exchanged confidences regarding their
relations with women. Hut, it was
' pointed out. no -Tie but a contemptible
person repeats them in court, especially
i in the case of a man passing as an "tli
cer and a gentleman.
Dreyfus, in replying, scored distinctly
when he brought out Junck's utter lack
"f sense' of honor, and himself declined
to enter into a discussion of the mat
ter.
A striking figure in court is Matthieu
Dreyfus, brother of the prisoner, who
usually sits in one of the front rows of
the witnesses, with his elbow on the
back of the seat in front of him. his
chin resting on his hand and his Intel
ligent face turned to the witness-stand.
With .ye and ear he follows every
. word and gesture of those on the stage,
and his look reflects the absorbing anx
iety of his mind. The audience may
titter and smile, but his features nevei
relax into the semblance of a smile.
They only soften with a look of pity as
he glances at his brother seated <> n the
stage and compelled to submit to the
ruthless fire which his enemies, one
after another, level at him from the
witness box.
The mnsr*interesting part of to-day's
proceedings was. as usual.- at the con
clusion. Major Lauth repeated in dif
ferent words his evidence given before
the Court of Cassation. He is not an
impressing personage. He has a bull
dog head and cavernous eyes, a monocle
bring stuck in his right eye. He w ;( s
dressed in the uniform of an officer in
the dragoons. The audience did not
follow his deposition with close atten
tion, as everybody knew what he would
say. A bored look fell on the audience,
and the infantry sergeant who acts as
[ messenger between. Colonel Jouaust,
Major Carrtere and the witnesses fell
asleep In his chair in front of the stage,
in full view of every one. He woke
with a start when Major Lauth uiiex
pectedly raised his voice.

THE ALLEGED AMOURS
OF THE PRISONER
Dreyfus Replies to His Accusers
and Creates a Better Impres
sion Than Heretofore.
RENNES, Aug. 21.â The third week of
the second trial by court-martial of Al
fred Dreyfus, captain of artillery, on
the charge of treason, began without in
cident at 6:30 this morning. There was a
large attendance at the Lycee at the
opening of the court, in view of the pos
sible appearance of Maitre Labor!, leading
counsel for the. defense. But though ho
is progressing as satisfactorily as possible
his physicians deemed it best for him to
remain quiet. When it became known
that the distinguished lawyer would not
participate in the proceedings a largo
number of disappointed persons quitted
the courtroom, leaving perceptible gaps
along the benches.
The court settled down to business
quickly, and by 9 o'clock five witnesses
had appeared at the bar. If this rate is
continued it Is considered the- court will
get through with the ninety-odd witnesses
before the beginning of September, and it
is expected the verdict will be delivered
by September 7.
Generals Roget, De Boisdeffre and Billot
were present, and Colonel Picquart took
a place a couple of rows behind them. The
colonel sat alone until M. Bertullus, the
examining magistrate, whose evidence
was so favorable to Dreyfus, entered and
sat beside Picquart, shaking him warmly
by the hand. All of the witnesses to-day
were hostile to Dreyfus, but as none of
theÂ« evidence was fresh but mostly a reit
eration of old statements, the audience
followed the depositions with compara
tively little Interest, a reference by M.
Gribelln to the relations of Dreyfus with
demimondaines proving the most appe
tizing portion of the morning's proceed
ings. A subdued titter went around the
courtroom when M. Gribelin even pro
fessed to know the. exact amount Dreyfus
spent upon his various amours.
M. Gribelin gave his testimony with an
honest demeanor and apparent sincerity,
but he did not strike one as being particu
larly intelligent. Nothing in his appear
ance would contradict the contention of
the Dreyfusards that he was Major
Lauth's tool in the machinations of the
general staff against Colonel Picquart,
who listened to M. Gribelin with an air
of contemptuous impatience.
M. Demnnge, counsel for the defense,
was more successful than usual in cross
examining him, and visibly disconcerted
M. Gribelin. Counsel scored a distinct hit
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 22, 1599.
TRANSPORT SHERMAN'S
JOURNEY ALMOST ENDED
THE pilots and ship captains, are of the opinion that we will have no more fog for several days to come,
yesterday it was so dear the Merchants' Exchange lookout at Point Lobos could see the Farallone.s. Should
the weather be similar when the Sherman arrives she will be posted almost as Boon as she reaches the islands.
To-day the California boys will begin keeping a lookout for the Golden Gate. At noon they should
not be much more than two days' steam away from home, and in consequence everybody on the transport
will be in a fever of expectancy. Nautical Expert McMillan calculates that at noon yesterday the Sherman was
in latitude 40 degrees ;i"> minutes north, longitude 150 degrees 25 minutes west, or about 1268 nautical miles* from
San Francisco.
The crowds which gather in front of the windows of The Call business office on Market street to gaze on
the large fac simile of the above map evince increasing interest as'the transport nears the Golden Gate. "She's
coming down hill now," remarked a spectator yesterday, "and the boys will be with us soon."
when he got M. Gribelin to admit that he i
mixed the intrigues of Dv Paty de Clam I
and Henry to shield Ksterhazy. and when
M. Gribelin was finally disposed of his |
evidence had suffered badly.
Dreyfus created a better impression to- I
day. He entered the courtroom with a
more confident bearing and replied to the i
witnesses in a calm voice without any j
theatrical gestures, and his remarks were
put so lucidly that he appeared to make !
an impression on the Judges, all of whom
are reputed to be bitterly opposed to him.
The session wound up with a scene, on
account of the extraordinary conduct >f
Colonel Jouaust, president of the court.
who permitted himself to make an un- \
warrantable display of partiality. M. j
Pertullus had been confronted with the
last witness, Captain Junck. and General j
Gonse had defended the latter when Colo
nel Pic-juart asked to be allowed to refute
some of Junck's remarks. Colonel Jouaust
made a gesture of impatience and shout
ed: "What! Again?"
An outburst .of booing and hissing came
from the audience at such a display of un
fairness. Judges and gendarmes quickly ;
suppressed the noise, but Colonel .Touanst
understood the well-merited rebuke ad- j
ministered to him. turned red and ad
journed the court ten minutes later. Fol- j
lowing is the evidence in detail:
Genera] Fabre. former chief of the !
fourth bureau of the general staff, was
the firs' witness. He said that In his ofli
clal capacity he compared the writing of
the bordereau with the writing of various j
officers in his bureau, including the writ- I
Ing of a probationer who had been in the
bureau during the previous '.ear and who ,
had not favorably impressed his com- |
rades.
This probationer. Dreyfus, who was re- i
carded as untrustworthy and insincere in i
his pretensions, was. according to the i
witness, equally disliked by his comrades
and superiors. He was constantly en
deavorme by all sorts of mi ana to learn i
AUSTRIAN GOES
TO DREYFUS' AID
PARIS. Aug. 21.â A dispatch from Ems says t: at Colonel Schneider,
the Austrian military attache at Paris, whose alleged letter incriminat
ing Dreyfus has been one of the principal weapons <>f the prosecution,
has started for Paris with the intention of instituting proceedings for
forgery and the employment of forged documents against those respon
sible for the authorship of the letter, which he distinctly repudiated^
LONDON. Aug. 22. â The Rome correspondent of the Daily News
says: "1 am in a position to assert positively that both Germany and
Italy have documents capable of proving that the French general staff
has been victimized by swindling spies, employing forged and worthless
documents, and that Captain Dreyfus was in no way connected with the
fraud."
ROME, Aug. 21.â A prominent Italian politician, according to the
I>on Chlscotte Delia Mancia, has in his possession one of the most im
portant documents referred to in the bordereau in the Dreyfus case, and
the handwriting of the document is unquestionably not that of Captain
Dreyfus.
the Becrets of the plan of concentration
of the Eastern Railway system, ;md in his
anxiety to secure Information neglected
his duties. His official duties, witness also
said placed it in Dreyfus' power to dis
close the documents referred u> in the
bordereau. Witness could emphatically
deny all Dreyfus bad Bald on tins subject.
When Major Bertin showed witness the
bordereau the latter was struck with the
rcsemblanc ! the calligraphy, Dreyfus
was the only officer who made a had im
pression In his bureau, and the opinions of
the chief of staff and heads of other d< -
partments confirmed witness' belief. Gen
eral Fabre In conclusion, declared he was
still as (Irmly convinced as in lsO4 that
the prisoner 'was the author of the bor- j
dereau.
After M. Demange had pointed out the ;
i discrepancy In Fabre's statements and
1 thog.- he voiced in ISM Colonel Jouautft
invited Dreyfus to reply. Th" prisoner
said General Kabre cmlte correctly de- i
i scribed the work on which he was en- ;
raged when a probationer, especially em
phasizing that lie hod to keep the dossier
relating to the concentration ot the cen
ters on the Eastern system posted up.
Thii was not a fictitious task, me pris
oner's reply was made in calm, measured
tones, and his frankness seemed to favor
ably impress the Judges.
Colonel d'Aboville. former deputy chief
Of the Fourth Bureau, related how Fabre
had shown him a photograph of an
anonymous note in which the writer In
timated to his correspondent, "evidently
foreign to the army." that he had confi
dential documents to communicate. Th<? ,
witness told Fabre that the documents
i mentioned showed the writer could only ;
I be an artillery officer belonging to the '
general staff who participated in the j
expeditions of the headquarters staff in
June and July, 1894. The position of Drey- ;
fus corresponded with those conditions,
and "to their great surprise" a striking
resemblance was apparent In the writings
of Dreyfus and the anonymous Letter.
Witness further declared that only a pro- .
liationer could possess the information
mentioned in the bordereau. It was not
only because of the resemblance of the
handwriting tfat suspicions were directed
at Dreyfus, but because he was in a posi
i Uon to be acquainted with the documents
. numerated.
M Demange wished to know why Col
' one.l d'Aboville said that in 1894, in order i
. t.i discover the author of the bordereau,
he thought it necessary to investigate the j
officers who participated In the expedi- j
tioiis of the general staff that year.
Witness replied that he was Induced to
do so by tho expression in the bordereau.
"I am going to the maneuvers." for he [
i considered the expedition of tho general
staff equivalent to the maneuvers, al
â  though troops were not actually present.
Counsel pointed out that a great deal of
1 argument wns founded on the expression.
"I am going to the maneuvers." Witness '
said it should not be forgotten that in 1894 I
! the expression was understood to apply to
the expedition of the headquarters staff, j
In reply to the usual question, Dreyfus
1 said that he never had held any conver
sation with General Sandherr. the late i
chief of the intelligence department, who
was so little acquainted with him that;
he once addressed him by another name. |
Greater Interest in the proceedings was!
i manifested when the name of the next
witness was announced, former Chief of :
' the Detective Department Cochefort. who .
i was present when Dreyfus underwent the
dictation test in Paty de Clam's office.
M. Ccchefort declared he knew abso- |
lutely nothing of the Dreyfus case when j
the Minister of "War. General Mercier,
summoned him to confer with him on the
subject of the bordereau and the suspi- j
clnns in regard to Dreyfus. General Mer
cler, Cochefort continued, asked his ad
vice as to the procedure which ought
to be followed and introduced him to Dv
Paty de Clam. Subsequently, after M.
Bertillon's report, the arrest of Dreyfus
was decided upon. ,
The witness proceeded to describe the
arrest and the famous scene of the dicta
tion test, saying that from the first re
mark dropped by Dv Paty de Clam the
prisoner displayed evident uneasiness.
Then the ex-Chief of Detectives said: "Dv
Paty.de Clam, placing his. hand on the
prisoner's shoulder, said:
"Captain Dreyfus, in the name of the
Minister of War I arrest you."
At the time of the examination of Drey
fus witness pained the impression that
he might be guilty, and so reported when
the Minister of War asked his opinion.
During this formal examination, Coche
fort added. Dreyfus protested his inno
cence very violently, and declared that he
did not know what they wanted or of
what he was accused. Witness afterward
sealed up the papers 'De Clam seized at
Dreyfus' residence.
Replying to the court. Cochefort said
that since his appearance on the scene he
had nothing to do with the Dreyfus af
fair which was In the hands of the mili
tary authorities. He had not then seen
the. writing of the bordereau, otherwise
his impression might have been modified.
During the course of his reply witness
mentioned Estcrhazy, but his remark was
inaudible.
After the remarks of Demange. Colonel
Jouauat invited Dreyfus to speak. The
prisoner replied:
"No; I will reply when De Clam is
here."
M. Gribelln. the principal archivist of
the headquarters staff, was the next wit
ness. He tÂ» stifled with great volubility
and expressed the opinion that when
Dreyfus was arrested in 1*94 he was en
acting a role by systematically denying
all the charges against him. even the
most obvious* and least important things,
and in declaring himself ignorant of mat
ters which should have been known to
every officer of the general staff. Wit
nesa said ho was cognisant <>f Dreyfus'
relations with loose women, in support
df this assertion It- mentioned an alleged
voluntary statement made by Mathieu
Dreyfus." brother of the prisoner, in the
witness' presence, that he had been
obliged t<i pull his brother frum the
clutches of a woman of this description
living near the champs Elyseea.
M Gribelin recapitulated the discovery
of the leakage at military headquarters,
the arrival nf the bordereau, etc.. and
dwell on the system of espionage con
ducted under cover of diplomatic im
munity, by Agents A. B and C.
Colonel Jouaustâ When was the bor
d( reau received at the Intelligence De
partment ?
M Gribelin The bordereau arrived at
1 In th< morning September. 1^94. After
examining it we did not hesitate to at
tribute It to an officer of the headquarters
Colonel Jouaust When was It submit
ted to Colonel Sandherr?
M. Gribelin-Why. the very first day.
The witness added: "As the bordereau
arrived through the ordinary channels, or
what at any raW was regarded as such,
no doubt was entertained as to its authen
ticity."
Replying to further questions, M. Grib
elin positively asserted that Ksternuzy
never came "to the Intelligence Depart
ment. In regard to the dictation tost the
Witness recalled Dreyfus' reply to Dv
Paty de clam when the latter pointed
out that his hands were shaking, name
ly, "my fingers were cold."
A me"mbor of the court-martial referred
to M. Gribelin's statements concerning
the use Colonel Picquart made of the
secret service funds and the witness ad
mitted the truth of Picquarts evidence
that surveillance of Esterhazy cost but
little.
Questioned as to alleged indiscretion of
Colonel Picquart In showing Maitre Le
Blois the secret dossier, witness admitted
that when be saw M. I.c Blois In Pic
quart's office in the autumn of 1596, while
the secret dossier of the carrier pigeon
Bervice was lying on Picquarfs table,
they had not been removed from the en
velopes. The envelopes, he explained,
wn open, but he admitted that that was
customary.
When quest ioned concerning the "lib
erateur" document Gribelin admitted he
still wondered how it came into Ester
hasy's hands, and could not understand
why Esterhazy was not arrested when he
brought the document to the Ministry of
War.
Colonel Jouaust. the other judges, and
M. Demange closely questioned M. Grlbe
lin on various points, and replying the
Witness imparted some information re
garding the petit bleu and the circum
stances tinder which the secret dossier
was communicated to Pi.-quart.
Replying to M. Demange. M. Grihelin
admitted having mixed up Dv Paty de
Clam's and Henry's intrigues in favor (if
Esterhazy. The admission created a sen
sation
It was by order of Colonel Henry, wit
ness added, he i Gribelin) put on spec
tacles and went to the Rue de Doui to
hand Lsterhazy a letter, to which the
latter was to "reply "yes" or "no." It
was also Colonel Henry who ordered v.it
ness to accompany Dv Paty de Clam to
Mount Souris Park at the time De Clam
masquerr led under a false beard. Wit
ness t lie ght it would have been much
simpler ;o have summoned Esterhazy to
the Ml.stiy of War, (specially as it was
knowr Ma'hieu Dreyfus was about to
public denounce him.
M. ' >emangH suggested that the de
nuncif tion of Mathiru Dreyfus could not
well 1 aye been foreseen when these "ro
manr c interviews with Esterhazy were
occurring, considering Mathieu himself
had not contemplated a denunciation."
M. Oribelin replied that at any rate It
was known that measures were in pro
gress against Esterhazy.
M. Demangeâ Why. then, since it was a
question of saving him. were fab-p beards
and blue spectacles resorted to.
M. Grlbellnâ You had bettor ;tsk Paty
do flam when hie comes in. (Laughter.)
Do not imagine It amused me. (Renewed
laughter.)
Replying to further questions'. M. Grihe
lin denied that he had ever opened a let
ter addressed to Piequart.
Counsel then wanted to know why the
letter signed "Speranza" was not sent
to Picquart, since all his letters were
: opened at the Ministry of War.
M. Gribelinâ A r, I never opened a letter
; addressed to Colonel Piequart. I do not
know why.
Colonel Piequart asked permission to
I question witness. /
"When I left the Ministry of War."
said Piequart. "1 asked M. Gribelin to
forward my letters to the addresses he
knew. Since the letter signed 'Speranza'
was not sent me. I must ask M. Gribelin
if he did not receive instructions from his
Chiefs to intercept it."
M. Grlebelinâ No, 1 never had such an
order.
Pioquart. after protesting against the
manner in which his correspondence was
tampered with, expressed surprise that
the question oj the employment of secret
service money should lie constantly mixed
up with the Dreyfus case with which, he
added, it had nothing whatever to do.
He also denied he had given M. Le Blois
the slightest information regarding the
secret dossier find said the only document
of the dossier revealed, and that was not
by himself, was the "eette canaille Dâ "
document, which had been utilized by the
enemies of Dreyfus. There was also the
"liberateur" document, which was deliv
ered to Esterhazy, who used it to levy
the most shameful blackmail on the Gov
ernment.
Colonel Lauth followed. Tie traversed
the ground covered by his evidence be
fore the Criminal Division of the Court
of Cassation in regard to the circum
stances und^r which Henry communicat
ed the bordereau. He said th.it when the
bordereau reached the lntellegence De
partment Henry was absolutely the only
officer who knew the agent who furnished
it and was the only officer known to the
agent. Henry, he explained, had appoint
ments with the foreign spy in question
only at S or 0 o'clock at night at the va
rious places. So it was impossible for
Henry to hand the papers received to
Colonel Sandherr the same evening.
Therefore he took them home and
brought them back to the office in the
morning. Very often these appointments
were kept on Saturday, and Major Lauth
believed the packet containing the bor
dereau was handed to Henry Saturday,
September 22, and was taken to the office
September 24.
"One morning." said Lauth. "it may
have been September 24. or another date.
though It cannot matter much, I arrived
at the office and was about to enter the
room in which I actually work, when Col
onel Henry, who was walking in the cor
ridor, eajled to me and took me into his
room. Captain Mather arrived simulta
neously. We had scarcely entered when
Colonel Henry showed the packet re
celved, and exhibiting some pieces be had
pasted together, said: "It is frightful.
Just see what I have found in this
packet.'
"We walked to a window and all three
began to read the contents of a paper,
which was none other than the bordereau.
We discussed who could be the author.
"I must add that M. Gribelin entered
the room and was informed regarding the
document. At the same time the bor
dereau was only shown to Colonel Sand
herr half or three-quarters of an hour
later, whin he arrived."
Next discussing the petit bleu. Major
Lauth said it reached Colonel Piequart
Inclosed in a packet, early in March. In
cidentally the witness mentioned the mis
sion to Nancy, on which Henry went, and
said that while he was absent his wife
came to the Intelligence Department to
ask for his whereabouts, as she knew
nothing of his departure.
"It was the same with all officers of the
department." Said Lauth. "Our famil
ies never knew where we were going
when we were sent on a mission, and it
was through the department that they
corresponded with us. That proves that
things were not conducted in the Fourth
Bureau as alleged by Colonel Piequart.
and the officers were not so negligent and
careless as he has asserted. "
Witness maintained this also disposed
of Piequart's assertion that Henry was in
the habit of working at home in the pres
ence of servants. As a matter of fact,
he added, the officers were very reserved
before their families. Continuing, wit
ness proceeded to speak of Picquart's
orders to destroy all evidence of the petit
bleu having been torn, and to determine
the office of origin by affixing a postmark.
"The spy Cuers," said Lauth. "entered
into relations with the Ministry of War
with the avowed purpose, of revenging
himself on his Government. He refused
to accept payment beyond his fare to
Basle. Cuers was evidently an agent
provocateur, who had been sent to us.
But we were never able to get anything
of the slightest value from him. It was
said," saia Lauth. "that we bullied him
to prevent him from speaking. I wish the
person who made the statement to come
here and repeat It. The truth is we bul
lied him. not to prevent his speaking, but
because he refused to say anything which
was not known, and that means the same
thing." (Laughter.)
Major Lauth's extremely long deposi
tion was listened to in profound silence.
He protested at Picquarfs allegations
against him in the course of the Taver
lifer inquiry, when Piequart represented
Lauth as tlie instigator and perhaps, also,
the writer of the Henry forgery.
"I declare." said Lauth. "that if by in
spiring or writing it I had a share in any
way whatever in the perpetration of tne
Henry forgery I should have avowed It
the day Henry committed suicide. I am
not even now afraid of the razor nor the
rope of Le Mereier-Picquart. nor even of
a broken glass omelette."
After controverting further statements
of Piequart. Major Lauth. in conclusion,
declared that "Henry, who knew nobody
on the newspapers." held quite aloof from
the "press campaign organized in re
sponse to the action taken by the friends
of Dreyfus."
Aft t a short adjournment the court re
assembled and the Judges questioned Ma
jor Lauth. They asked his opinion of the
Schneider letter of November 30. ]Sft7. Wit
ness replied that it was authentic, and
emanated from Agent Pierre. Replying to
M. Demange, witness said he never saw
the photograph certain newspapers as
serted he took, representing Piequart ajid
Schwarzkoppen strolling arm in arm at
Carlsbad.
"I suppose It was I who took it," the
witness added ironically.
M. Demnngeâ l do not accuse you. i
At the instance of M. Demange Colonel
Piequart again described the alterations
of the petit bleu and declared that the
last time he saw it, the day before he
started on his mission, the petit bleu was
still in the same condition as when Major
Laiith handed it to him in November,
1897. When Piequart saw it In the posses-
Finn of General Pellieux. former Minister
of War it seemed to him that the hanci
wrUing had been somewhat modified, and
at the Tavernier Inquiry he noticed that
alterations of quite a serious character
had been made. Ruled lines had been
erased. Moreover, experiments showed
|he address had been written in ink made
l>f gall nuts, while a superimposed vvord
was written in ink made of â¢ofwood.
Replying to the president of the court.
Major Lauth said that when he photo
graphed the petit bleu he -did not notice
any sign of erasure. Picquart said the
plate taken by Major Lauth bore no
traces of erasure. The photograph alone
hau been tampered with. âââ,*
Colonel Jeuaust-Was there an expert
examination? â¢ â,,,_.' j_
Picquart-Yes: It was a searching in
quiry. Besides, the dossier in the Tav

Captain Junck followed. He said i he
was a probationer simultaneously with
Dreyfus, but in another . department of
the War Office. He saw the Prisons a
great deal, and held conversations in
which he alleged Dreyfus spoke of great
sums he had lost in gambling and inter
course with loose women. proceeded,
"One we " the visiting the proceeded.
"whe n n we were visiting the Concours
Hlpplque we met three immoral women
who bowed to us. Dreyfus returned their
greeting, and I said to him. ' ell. for a
married man you have nice, acquaint
ances. 1 He replied that they were old
friends of his bachelorhood, and, pointing
to one of them, said her name was \al
tesse, and that she had a house on the
Champs Elysees, where she gave nice par
ties, where pretty women were to be met
and where there was much gamultng.
Dreyfus also lasted of hie ; large means,
and .spoke with great re ish of his. com- .
fortable house and travels.
The witness continuing said that Drey - (
fus was well acquainted with the scheme
for the concentration of troops and could
trace It on any map, as most of the otner
probationers could. ' ' â  . -Â
Witness then detailed the work of the
different bureaus, . and proceeded to a?
monstrate that the Probationers were cog
nizant of the plans for the transporta
tion and concentration of the troops and
how Dreyfus was ordered 0 draw a re
port on the German artillery, comparing
it with the French artillery, having ac
cess to all the necessary documents.
In regard to the Madagascar note Drey
fus, Junck claimed, told the witness
that his cousin had procured him inter
esting information. Captain Junck then
spoke of the efforts of Dreyfus to secure ;
the firing manual, and discussed the the
ory that Henry might have divulged the
documents in the bordereau, bucti a sup
position, the captain declared, was ut- |
terly impossible. Â . 'Â,ââ ââ
Captain Junck proceeded, and his ac
count of what occurred on that occasion
was punctured â  with laughter from the
audience. M. Demanse asked Captain j
Junck why he â  had not given the court ,
of Cassation information of the. character
which he adduced to-day as proof against
Dreyfus and why he had told the Court or
Cassation he had seen nothing in the con
duct of Dreyfus to lead to the belief that
be was a traitor. This somewhat con
fused the captain, who replied j that ho
had not thought of it, but added that he ,
adhered to to-day's statement about the
character of the prisoner. Dreyfus again !
being asked the usual question, replied: i
"I will not speak to the witness of private ;
confidences he has made to me. If Cap
tain Junck's ideas of honor allow him to ;
divulge nriv ate conversation mine do not.
I have clean hands and I wipe them clean.
Colonel Picquart.jumped to his feet.
Colonel Jouaustâ What, again?
Colonel Picquart insisted, and referring
to the petit bleu in order to demonstrate
how valueless was Captain Junck's evi
dence, said the court had only to com
pare the captain's evidence with the re
suits of the Ravary. Fabre and Tavernier j
inquiries to see the contradictions be
tween him and Major I,auth. The court,
he added, then would see th* utter valus
lessness of Captain Junck's statements.
(Sensation.)
The court then adjourned.

BILL IS NOT
EXTRAVAGANT
Opinion of Commissioner
of Navigation Cham
berlain.
COMPARISONS MADE
Only a Fair Inducement to Owners
to Obtain American Registry
for Their Vessels.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON.
Aug. 21. â Commissioner of Navigation
chamberlain has made some interest
ing comparisons of: the amounts that
would be paid in subsidies tc American
ships if the Hanna-Payne bili should
become a law, with the amounts paid
by foreign governments to encourage
shipping under their flags. In th i state
ment which he has prepared he combats
the idea that the. rates proposed by the
Han na- Payne, bill are. unreasonable. He
says some' of the recent criticisms of
the Hanna-Payne bill : convey the im
pression that the compensation it pro
vides for steamships is wholly unrea
sonable. .
'".On the general principle of the bill," |
says-Mr. Chamberlain, "differences of j
opinion are to be expected, but its de- !
tails are not, I believe, subject criti- j
cism on the score <â¢'. -extravagance, at i
least when compared with the support |
foreign governments offer to their mail j
steamships. The' bill gives a uniform j
rate of compensation to all vessels (sail â¢
or steam)^-virtually 1. cent per gross
ton for each 100 nautical r miles trav
ersed, to offset the increased cost of]
construction and operation in the
United States. The bill also gives vir- j
tually 1 cent per tun per 100 miles, spe- J
oiai allowances being made for steam- j
ships of over 1500- gross tons and of 14 j
knots speed or upward. :
"About 80 per cent of seagoing screw ;
steamships in the world which comply
with the requirements named as to size j
and speed now receive and for some i
years have' received assistance in some j
form fr<-:n the various governments |
whose (lags they respectively fly. The
â  proposition, so far from being unwar- :
ranted, is merely in compliance with the j
ordinary maritime custom of years. It ]
seems strange only to those who have '
not lÂ«Mked atthe. facts.
"Large British mail, contracts are |
awarded in lump sums, but I have
taken pains to ascertain the steamships j
by which they are performed, their
size, speed, number of voyages and dis
tahces traversed during a year. â ; â  .
â¢"With this data.it is easy to ascertain â¢
the additional rates named which simi- I
â  lar vessels would be entitled to under ;
the â¢ Hanna-Payne bill. Viewed an- :
other way, this comparison will show !
what foreign governments pay to cer- |
tain steamships, and what American ,
â  steamships' of preets.ely the same size,
and speed running parallel t,o them
â  throughout a year would receive."
. Mr. Chamberlain's table is as fol
lows:
_ : : _ â . i
"The bill thus proposes to offset the
$3,778,982 awarded under British con
tracts with (3,488,834 awarded under
American contracts. The proposition is
ctravagant, nor does it mean a pot
>ney for the owners of fast Ameri
ships. Were it not for two
b, viz., that Americans will obtain
advai â  operating slow cargo
- in conjunction with., mail steam
ships, and that our Pacific intercourse
â with Asia is not subject u> Suez canal
the bill would probably fail to ac
< umpllsb iip put pose.
Any method of comparing facts with
which I am familiar will show that
such advantages as the Hanna-Payne
bill gi\>-s to American shipping are as
much to the benefit of cargo vessels
tnships, in spite of higher
rates given to the latter class, which
have been con puted on the basis of ef
forts by other nations to maintain fast
â¢i mail line?."

CREW OF COLUMBIA
DEMAND HIGHER WAGES
Desert the Vessel at Tacoma and En
gage the Services of an At
torney.
TACOMA. Aug. âThe crew of the
American ship Columbia of San Francisco
to-day walked aft and demanded of Cap
tain Nelson that ' they be paid coastwise
wages for the voyage from Tacoma to ;
San Francisco. They signed articles in
San Francisco for a voyage to Vladivo
stok and return via Puget Sound and way
ports. The sailors now claim that they
were given to understand by the- United
States Shipping Commissioner at â  San
Francisco that they would be given regu
lar coasting wages on the voyage which
was to ensue after the Columbia's arriv
ing at Taooma from Vladivostok and
thence departing for San Francisco. The
articles in no wise mention any such :
agreement, and Captain Nelson refuses to i
accede to the men's demands. The sailors
thereupon left the ship, and going up !
town engaged the services of an attorney
to prosecute their case.
According to the spokesman for the men
their demand rests on the following state
ment: "When we signed at San Francis
co the United States Shipping Commis
sioner read the articles to us. He stated
that we were to be paid coastwise wages
after reaching Puget Sound and again
making sail for another port on the Pa
cific Coast, which, of course, would be
San Francisco."
"Why was not this proviso Incorporated ;
in the "articles," was asked.
"Well, we don't know," replied the ;
spokesman. "If you can't believe what a
Shipping Commissioner says, who Is a'
sailor to believe?"
Captain Nelson states that the sailors' i
demand is out of all reason; that the men
shipped for Vladivostok, returning to San '
Francisco or any port on the Pacific. ,
The sailors are getting $20 per month, '
while the coasting wages are $35. The I
Columbia is loading coal.

CROPS DESTROYED IN
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
Ice Has Formed in Many Places and
Farmers Will Suffer From
the Cold Wave.
REDDING, Aug. 2Lâ The exceptionally
cool summer that Northern California
hits been favored with this year has
brought disaster to th<Â» mountain districts
of this county and has practically made
b dean sweep of all crops subject to
frost n Modoe County and Southeastern
OrcÃon. A groat deal of damage was In
flicted also in Siskiyou, Trinity and Las
gen counties. Reports from Northeastern
Shasta, including the Whitmore. and Flat
wood* country, Burney Valley and Fall
Hiv. r Valley, givi- details of a series of
heavy frosts that destroyed practically
everything subject to destruction by se
vere cold.
Tons of beans and late potatoes and
other garden staples nro past harvesting.
Th.' most damage in this county was sus
tained in Burney and Fall River valleys,
where Ice formed for several nights In
succession. In .Modoc County In the vi
cinity of Alturas everything was killed.
Thf onVy KHnlcns that escaped destruc
tion w< re aloiiK the foothills of Surprise
Valley and Goose Lake. At Alturas ice
formed as thick ms a pane of glass. South
eastern Oregon was also directly in the
track of the cold wave, sustaining an
amount of damage that will be a severe
blow and a great hardship to the farm
ing "lasses. The damage everywhere was
rendered all the .greater because in the
regio.is affected the season is always a
month to six weeks later than in the Sac
ratnento Valley. August has been a phe
nomenal month this yar- cool and de
lightful. On this fact the prediction is
partly based of a severe winter, with
heavy rain and snow and high water. A
hard winter is needed, and the country
generally is better prepared for it than
ever it was.

afternoon by a tiger shark seven feet
in length and escaped a horrible death
only by displaying rare presence of
mind and diving each time the shark
rushed at him. He reached shore safely
after a harrowing experience and this
svening is receiving the congratulations
af his friends.
Canavan went fishing to-day at
Townes Point in company with John
Palmer, a wealthy veteran of the Civit
War. While Palmer sat on a ledge nf
rock and baited his hooks for fish his
companion proceeded to enjoy <i swim.
He had got about 150 feet from shore
when Palmer sighted a tiger shark and
yelled to Canavan that th*> man-eater
was making for him. Canavan dived
Just in time to avoid the shark's teeth
and made for the shore. He was fol
lowed by the shark and had to dive
several times to evade its rushes. Be
ing an expert swimmer he managed to
reach shore and sank to the ground
exhausted with his efforts.
Baffled in its human prey the shark
afterward swallowed one of Palmer's
hooks and bit the wire snell in two as
nicely as could have been done with a
pair of pincers. Both Palmer and Cana
van describe the shark as being about
seven feet long and spotted like a
leopard* Canavan declares that he is
thankful to be alive and has taken his
last dip in the waters of the bay.

FRENCHMAN SWIMS
WHITE HORSE RAPIDS
Boat Upset, and It Was a
Question of Life or
Death.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 21.â The suc
cessful swimming of the White Horse
Rapids by a human being has been re
garded as one of the impossible feats
of endurance and bravery, but this feat
is now a reality and was accomplished
by a Frenchman on August 2 in the
person of Leon Liard.
This accomplished swimmer, in com
pany with his countrymen, Eugene
Barbin and Benel Estier, were descend
ing the Yukon River in a skiff headed
for Dawson. Rounding the point above
the whirlpool they saw the sign of the
mounted police, "Danger, White Horse
Rapids." They rowed for shore, but the
current drew tin- skiff Into the rapid
water. It turned stern foremost and
In trying to get the boat about the men
upset the flimsy craft. Liard struck
out boldly to swim the rapids, while his
companions, Barbin ami Estier, stuck
to the boat. Liard was out of sight
half the time, the waves curling over
him, while, the people on the bank were
holding their breath as he appeared
again and again, going at a rapid pace.
He finally, after a desperate struggle,
reached the left bank below the steam
boat landing. There was a crowd of
willing hands to assist him up the
bank and cheer followed cheer as he
was dragged ashore. Barbin and Estier
clung to the boat until opposite the
landing and reached shallow water by
swimming twenty feet.

CLOUDBURST IN
ROUND VALLEY
Bridges Washed Away and
Hundreds of Fish in the
Stream Killed.
COVELO, Aug. 21.â A storm swept
over a small portion of Round Valley
yesterday which for singularity
amounted to a freak. The storm cloud
hovered over the southeastern range of
hills all the afternoon, slowly sailing
before a stiff northwest breeze. At 1
o'clock in the afternoon the inky cloud
enveloped the southern half of the val
ley In a dense canopy, obscuring the
sun and nmking a deep twilight of the
noonday. Deep rolling thunder and
vivid lightning: flashes marked the next
half-hour and then all cleared off and
was as serene as before.
At CovelO, a little northwest of the
center of the valley, only a few drops
of rain fell, while at the southern edge,
a few miles distant there was a veri
table cloudburst. In less than half an
hour the sloughs and water courses, al
ways dry in the summer, were over
flowing, tearing out floodgates with a
crash. Roads were gullied so badly
that they will have to be repaired be
fore being passable. An immense
amount of damage was done" to crops
in stacks and yet unthrashed.
But the most remarkable result of the
storm is that it killed all the fish in
that portion of Round Valley Creek
lying in the track of the waterspout.
The surface of the stream is covered
with dead fish from the size of a pin
fish to a regular three-pounder. Buz
zards and swine are vying with each
other for the spoils of the elements.
From the number, size and condition
of the fish there is no doubt that all
the fish in that portion of the stream
was killed.
The theory advanced here by the wis<*
ones is that the storm was electrical
and that the fish were electrocuted,,
while the foolish say they were
drowned. The most likely explanation
is that the sudden influx of water with
foreign debris must have been the
cause of the destruction of the fish.
RIOTERS ARE KILLED
BY THE POLICE
PRAGUE. Bohemia, Aug. 21.â Serious
disturbances have taken place at Grad
litz, a town fifteen miles east of Konig
grntz, due to racial differences between
the Csecks and Germans. A detachment
of gendarmes, who are guarding the mu
nicipal buildings were stoned from an ad
jacent public house. They were unsuc
cessful in their attempt to clear the house
of their assailants, but made several ar
rests during the night. The gendarmes
were fired on and charged on the mob
with drawn swords, the result being that
four persons were killed and others were
injured. The troops and further rein
forcements of gendarmes were sent to the
scene of the disturbances and eventually
Quiet was restored. i
MURDERED BY
ARMY OFFICERS
OF FRANCE
Terrible Crime Committed by
an Expedition Commanded
by Two Captains.
TRAGEDYj[ SOUDAN
Nine Men, Including Lieutenant
Colonel Klobb and Lieutenant
Meunier, Are Shoi Down.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Aur- 21.â M. de Crais. Minis
ter for the Colonies, has received a
dispatch from the Governor General of
French West Africa, fully confirming
the Figaro's story, cabled to the Asso
ciated Press this morning, of the kill
ing of Lieutenant Colonel Klobb, and
Lieutenant Meunier by members of a
French expedition under the conduct of
Captains Voulet and Chanoine, in the
French Soudan.
The confirmation has created a great
sensation and caused the most painful
impression, the only explanation sug
gested being that Captain Voulet had
become mentally affected by the cli
mate. Curiously enough, the killing oc
curred July 14, the date of the French
national tete.
It appears that on news being re
ceived of the barbarity of the Voulet-
Chanoine mission toward the natives on
the march toward Lake Chad, the Du
puy Ministry instructed Lieutenant Col
onel Klobb, who was at Kayer, to pro
ceed with a column, overtake the mis
sion, investigate the shargea and as
sume command, on July 14 the Klobb
party overtook the mission at Zimber,
near Domangar. Lieutenant Colonel
Klobb sent word to Captain Voulet.
who replied that he would shoot him if
he advanced. Notwithstanding this
threat Klobb advanced and made him
self known to Voulet, who ordered him
peremptorily to stop. This order was
disregarded, and when the Klobb party
was within 150 meters of Voulet's
t loops, tiie latter, on his order, fired
three volleys, which were followed by
independent tiring. Lieutenant Meun
ier fell dead. Lieutenant Colonel Klobb,
wcunded in the leg by the first volley,
was dispatched by being shot in the
head. Voulet then ordered a bayonet
charge, and the remainder of the Klobb
column fled, carrying their wounded
and leaving, besides the two officers,
nine men dead. The survivors, ten of
whom were wounded, reached Bosso
under command of a native sergeant.
The Voulet-Chanoine mission has
taken to the bush, but according to the
advices received by M. de Crais a strong
column was to be sent in pursuit.
Captains Voulet and Chanoine have
both had distinguished careers in the
Soudan. The mission, now outlawed.
consists, besides the leaders, of Captain
Joual! and Lieutenant Palllier, Dr.
Hanric and two French sergeants.
VOULET'S RECORD.
French Papers Comment Upon His
Horrible Crime.
LONDON. Aug. 21.â The Rennes corre
spondent of the Dally News, commenting
upon the effect which the murders of
French officers in the French Soudan will
have upon the Dreyfus case, says: "Cap
tain Chanoine is a son of General Cha
noine. the former Minister of War, who
joined the other War Ministers in swear
ins: on his soul and conscience that Drey
fus was guilty."
Referring to General Chanoine's myste
rious resignation from the Brisson Cabi
net, the correspondent says: "It is evident
that ih>- X;ui"!iii.list leaders got wind of
t!.- atrocities <ommltted by Captains Vou
let and Chanoine in the Soudan on men.
women and children, which were of such
a character as to bf> unprintable. He en
tered th Brisson ministry pledged to sup
porl revision of the. Dreyfus case, but just
as President I'aure was blackmailed Into
opposing revision by threats to disclose
certain family stories, so General Cha
noine was blackmailed into resigning and
renouncing his conscientious belief in the
innocence of Dreyfus by a threat to reveal
the misdeeds of his son."
PARIS, Aug. 22.â The morning papers
are full of comments upon the murder of
Lieutenant Colonel Klobb and Lieutenant
Meuni< r in the French Soudan, ami of
speculations as to the motives of Captain
Voulet.
The Figaro says Captain Voulet often
talked of the possibility of establishing an
African empire, and asks if he is about
to attempt to realize the scheme.

IN COLORADO
IS BURNED
A. Conflagration at Victor
Causes a Loss Estimated
at $2,000,000.
SCENE OSEOF TERROR
j Vll the Principal Business Houses
Are Consumed and Many De
stroyed by Dynamite.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo.. Aug. 21. -Â«
Fire has utterly destroyed the business
portion of the city of Victor, causing
a loss estimated at $2,000,000. Beginning
shortly after noon <he flre raged until
evening, consuming everything in its
way. It had its origin, it is thought,
in the Merchants' Cafe, adjoining the
Bank of Victor, on the corner of Third
street and Victor avenue. A strong
wind from the south fanned the flames
and in a few minutes all the surround
ing houses were afire.
Help was summoned from Cripple
Creek, but the town had been built in
the early days of the camp and was of
pine timber for the most part, and
burned like paper. Efforts were made
to stop the progress of the flames by
blowing up buildings in their path by
means of dynamite, and all afternoon
the hills have roared with the explo
sions, but the effort was in vain.
The flre claimed the Bank of Victor,
the postoffice on the corner opposite,
crossed Third street and followed the
row of blocks between Third and
Fourth streets to the north, taking the
Victor Banking Company, the West
i era Union Telegraph Company's office
and the office of the Colorado Telephone
Company, the Hotel Victor, on the op
posite side of Fourth street, and the
three great shaft houses of the Gold
Coin Mining Company and its ore bins,
among the largest in the Cripple Creek
district. From there the flames were
swept northward by the half hurricane
which was blowing, and never stopped
until they had taken the Florence and
Cripple Creek depot and the fine new
depot of the Midland Terminal road, at
the head of Fourth street. All the
buildings between these are a total loss,
with practically all their contents, for
the flames were so rapid in their prog
ress that nothing could be saved.
The scenes of the grea-t Cripple Creek
conflagration were duplicated. Hurry
ing before the roaring flames went
men, women and children, carrying
what they coula snatch from the
flames, racing for their lives. The crash
of buildings torn asunder by dynamite
and the crackle of the flames as they
consumed the dry buildings hastened
their flight, and the pall of smoke added
a terror to the spectacle.
A special train was placed at the
command of this city by the Florence
and Cripple Creek Railroad, and three
companies of firemen, with apparatus,
were rushed to the scene. They worked
all afternoon in a vain endeavor to stay
the march of the flames. The residence
portion of the city has suffered com
paratively little, but the business por
tion is paralyzed and suffering is bound
to follow. The burned area may be
roughly designated as the space be
tween the head of Fourth street and
Victor avenue, extending from the Gold
Coin mine biuldings on the west to a
point near Second street, and down
Third street almost to Diamond avenue.
The fire was gotten under control this
evening. Conservative estimates place
the loss at $2,500,000.
The first house was built in Victor in
October, 1893. In July of the following
year the city was incorporated, and five
years later it contained 10.000 people.
That is about the population now.
The heaviest losses are: Gold Coin
mine, consisting of shaft, ore houses
and machinery, $100,000; the Woods In
vestment Company, $100,000; J. B. Cun
nigham, $75,000; Morrell Hardware

PLUNGER HOWARD STILL
BAFFLING THE POLICE
CHARLES DOYLE, ALIAS HOWARD
CHARLES VIVIAN DOYLE, alias "Plunger" Hill, alias Aupru=tus Howard,
ex-convict, swindler and prince of bunko mm. Is leading the police a merry
chase in the game of hide-and-seek which has been going on for over a
The longer Howard eludes tho police the hotter seem his chances for mak
ing pond his ultimate â¢ scape. Chief Lees 1 detectives have spent the entire
week searching the suburban towns and the outlying districts of this city in the
hope of finding some faint cle-w <>f the missing fugitive's whereabouts.
The letter written by Mr. Little <*f Wells, Fargo & Co. to a prominent business
man in this city, in which he stated that he saw Howard on the Oregon overland
last Saturday nipht, gave the police a rather live clew to the fugitive's where
abouts.
Chief I.ees i? confident, even In the face of hi? thwarted efforts, that he will
land Howard behind the bars before many more days have passed.
When H6ward first met Willard Green, the Denver capitalist, whom he de
frauded out of thousands of dollars, he palmed himself off successfully on Green as
a retired officer of the English navy. Judging from the accompanying photograph
of Howard in his fak milia, It is quite easy to 'comprehend how Green suc
cumbed so easily to the olly-tongued swindler.
The theory that Howard is making his way toward Victoria was strength
ened by Information received a day or so ago from Oakland. On Saturday
evening:, August 12, Conductor Graves, who had charge of a special train to the
Emeryville racetrack, saw Howard at the Oakland mole, accompanied by a thin
faced man answerins the description of Bob Creelman, known in racing circlea
Nigger Fool Creelman. Graves knows Howard well, and he Insists that he
.--aw him on that night. His statement is corroborated by Special Officer Ma
loney, who was on the mole at the time. Maloney also knows Howard, and
he is equally positive that the "Plunger" was on the mole that evening and in
all probability boarded tli" northbound train. This information gives color to the
letter written by Mr. Little of Wells, Kargo & Co.
Conductor Graves' Btory was poured into the ears of the Chief of Police of
Oakland. Special Officer Maloney also notified Constable Teague, who in turn
notified Attorney Pillsbury. This information has been in tho hands of Chief
Lees for several days, and in all probability it has done much to strengthen his
theory that Howard Is making tracks for Victoria. Chief Lees stated last night
that Victoria was well covered, and it Howard is seen there he will be taken
into custody.
The Chronicle published an Interview in Sunday morning's issue purporting
to come from Robert S. Logan, in which the latter stated that he delivered mail
at Howard's house addn ssed in the "Plunger's" handwriting. On one occasion
the mail carrier asked where he should leave the mail addressed to "Hand
some" George Adams, and a voice .rom the head of the stairs that'sounded like
Howard's replied that no mull fir Adams should ! â â¢ left at the house.
Logan denies that he ever made s<; :h a statement to a Chronicle reporter or
to anybody else.
REDUCTION OF

! The Fire Commissioners and the fire un- :

j ter was discussed at a meeting of the

The resolution of the Board of Super

i as many more as possible, with the view
i of reducing the expenses of the depart

: Herold Jr., Charles de Haven, I. â  Gutte
â¢ and Rolla v. Watt, the committee on
: fire ordinances, fire department and water
supply of the Board of Fire Underwrit
| ers, which met on Saturday, as follows:
' Referring to the recent resolution of the
. Board of Supervisors of the city and county
of San Francisco, requesting your honorable
board to dispense with 3SB hydrants now in
place in this city, and with a greater number
1 If your board can see their way to do bo, the
: Committee on Fire Department and Water
: Supply of the Board of Fire Underwriters
! view with alarm this proposal to seriously re-
I duce the efficiency of the fire protection of this
City and hamper the work of our Fire De
j partment in case of a large conflagration, and
beg to urge upon your honorable board the
[serious menace involved . to the property of
four citizens In thin effort to make a saving
I In city expenses, which may be many times
1 exceeded by a single fire loss owing to the
I absence of the necessary protection.
! This committee realizes, as we think that
! your honorable board, with its long associa
! tion with the means of protection against lire
which this city enjoys, must, also feel, that our
hydrant service 'ought to be materially In
' creased rather than diminished, and we beg
.to call the attention cf your honorable board
;to the fact that but recently the Hoard of
i Fire Underwriters - has made a sweeping re
! dnctlon in rates throughout the city, confi
dent in the expectation that the fire protection
j of the city would be Increased and net dlmln
, ! lshed^ This reduction in premiums will result
; in the saving to our citizens of many times
j the amount which It Is proposed to save in
expense by the , abolition, of these hydrants;

begs to urge' upon your honorable board the
Importance of continuing at least the protection
which the city now enjoys, If you cannot see
your way to recommend an increaee In same,
which we think you will agree with us Is
greatly needed. '
| After discussing the matter the Com
missioners embodied their views in the
1 following communication, which was sent
to the Board of Supervisors Immediately
I after the meeting:
The Board of Fire Commissioners teg leave
to acknowledge the receipt of your communi
cation of the- lÂ«th inst., containing a copy
of resolution No. 2311 (fourth series), directing
the Board of Fire Commissioners to report the i
location of 396 hydrants that could be dis

spared, etc. . â¢ ,
In reply we desire to say that we are un
j able to comply with the requirements of said
resolution, for the reason that we have no I
knowledge of any hydrants that can be re- i
moved without seriously endangering property i
In the vicinity from fire, and the chief en- i
glneer of of this department reports to this
board that all hydrants now set ar* nbs-j

from fire. We beg: to call yojr attention to
the fact that our city Is built almas; entirely

of near-by cities in case of a large conflagra
tion such as occurred in Boston in ISS9. That
city at that time hsvl a department of forty
three engine companies, and received assist
ance from other towns to the number of
fifty-seven engines, making 100 engines to work
at Bald fire. If San Francisco were visited by
such a conflagration, not one-third that num
ber of engines could be supplied with water,
for the reason that the hydrants are now too
far apart to supply them at a single fire In
ony part of the city. We also desire to state
that the Hoard of Fire Underwriters of the
Pacific made a great reduction -in the rates
of Insurance throughout the city. In the ex
pectation that the fire protection would be in
creased rather than reduced. Since the pas
sage of wild resolution, we are In receipt of
a communication from paid Board of Under
writers protesting against any reduction in the
fire service, of which we send you a copy,
and make the same part of this ' communica
tion.
"We have given the question of fire protection
a long and serious study, and it is our Judg
ment that the service should be Increased In
stead of reduced; that instead of hydrants be
ing removed, many more should be set when
ever and wherever the water company can be
induced to lay larger mains.
In closing, we desire to say that every fire
that has occurred In this city, covering a
large area of territory, was caused principally
by lack qf hydrants and Insufficient water sup
ply. We sincerely hope that your honorable
board will reconsider this resolution, as i\e
feel confident that If it were carried Into rffeet
serious results are likely to follow.
The Commissioners also recommended
the Board of Supervisors to pay John
Maxwell of Engine 28 $50 for injuries re
ceived while in the discharge of his duty
at a lire on July 4. at Powell and Chestnut
streets, during which he was severely
burned.
The following promotions were made:

Nearly Burned to Death.
HAYWARDS, Aug. 21. -F. 8. . Jackson ;
was nearly burned to death to-nght and
but for the speedy work of a man named
Souza he could not have escaped.
A local merchant received a tank of oil :
from San Francisco to-day and sold some >
to several customers. Jackson procured
some of It and filled a coal oil stove In his [
cellar. He proceeded to light the stove i
and Instantly there was an explosion, and i
the cellar was in llames, while the blazing i
oil was blown all over Jackson's clothing. ;
Jackson yelled, but was completely en- I
veloped in flames. Souza was near the j
house and hoard the explosion. He rushed
Into the collar and encountered the flames,
but seeing a man on lire he hastily !
snatched some blankets from a bed and
threw them around Jackson, at the same
time dragging him out of the cellar. The
flames were extinguished, but not before |
Jaokson was very badly burned.
An examination of the wreck clearly !
proved that the stove had contained gaso- :
line and not coal oil. It was discovered
later that the tank from which Jackson
had obtained his purchase was also filled
with gasoline.
There will probably be some lawsuits
growing out of the mistake.
WELLS-FARGO
MUST HONOR
THE WAR TAX
Statement of Attorney
General Ford.
"Whether or not the tax as imposed by
the war revenue laws is collected is mt
a matter for the concern of this State.
The Government will see that the law Is
obeyed, but it is the duty of the State to
see that corporations reaping vast profits
yearly under the protection of its laws
shall do their duty toward the people. It
has been suggested here ihat the company
may evade the payment of the war tax
by refusing to accept packages until Ihe
revenue tax has been aflixed by the ship
per to the manifest. If the company does
this we may see lit to annul the corpora
tion and place the business in uth^r
hands. It has also been suggested that if
this company is held liable for the war
tax it will raise the express charges. As
this is not an issue here we will not dis
cuss it, but if the company should follow
this course in event of adverse decision
there is time ahead for those intrusted to
enforce the law to 6ee that it Is obeyed."
In the above language Attornej General
Ford closed his argument before Judge
Troutt yesterday in the matter of the ap
plication of \Y. H. Anderson, on behalf of
the people, for a writ of mandate to com
pel Wells, Fargo & Co. to bear its share
of war expenses and ufiix the proper
stamp to each receipt issued, instead of
compelling the people to bear this burden,
which the. law never intended they should.
When the matter came up for argument
Attorney General Ford and his assistant,
W. M. Abbott, appeared for the petitioner,
while the defendant was represented by
Attorney A. Sutro in the absence of E. 8.
Pillsbury, attorney of record. The facts
of the case on which the action is ;o bo
determined are these:
On October iy last W. 11. Anderson, then
Assistant Attorney" General, presented to
Wells, Fargo & Co. a package for ship
ment to Sacramento. Express cbarg sa
were paid by Mr. Anderson, but the com
pany demanded mat he attix an Internal
revenue stamp of one cent to the bill of
lading ur manifest. Contending thai iKis
was the duty of the corporation the d< -
mand was not complied With, and the
| company thereupon refused to forward
the pacKage. Upon sucii refusal a peti
; tion tor a writ <>i mandate to be difectcd
! against the company compelling it to af
!ix the revenue Btamp was applied for.
Attorney General Ford first addressed
the court. He contended under the law it
was plainly the duty of the company to
furnish, attix and cancel the stamp and
not that of the shipper. Continuing, he
said: "Under the war revenue act it 1j
the duty of the carrier to issue a receipt,
and it is mandatory that such receipt be
stamped before issued. It has been held
that the requirement that a written
memorandum be given by the seller U<
the buyer of oral sales in the stock ex
change, and that a Btamp be affixed to
such memorandum is a lawful means of
enforcing the collection of the tax and the
same rule applies to receipts issued by
express companies.
"It' a receipt be issued without a stamp
is aflixed thereto the person or corpora
tion issuing the same is iiable to a fine of
$100, while there is no penalty prescribed
: for the receiving of the same, th<
penalty being imposed on the person Issu
i ing the same. It has also been held that
i the person who makes <>r issues the same
i must alii x the stamp thereto, the burden
| being plainly imposed on t!)e maker of
| the receipt.
On this line Attorney General Ford made
further argument. 11" said that the ship
per was Indifferent as to whether s re
ceipt was Issued or not. All he asked
! was that his goods be accepted and ft.r
--; Warded upon the payment of the usual
; charge, but for Its own protection the
I company was forced to Issue the receipt,
h.nee it was it? duty to pay the tax.
-Mr. Sutro followed Mr. Ford and in part
said:
"Without much calculation it can reart
i Ily be seen that the forcing of this burden
: upon the company would result in a great
i hardship, while on the other hand even
the largest shippers could not complain.
If the company was compelled to attix
: these Btamps as it is herein intended to
I compel it, it would result in an annual
loss of about $]>;<mi,m. Âr. in other words,
a sum equal to 2 per cent of its entire
I capital stock. Hut from matters of fact to
i those of law, I wish to Impress upon the
court that the revenue tax law does not
provide for a direct tax, and If it is such
j it is unconstitutional, as it Is not properly
: apportioned among the States in accord
: ance with their population. The idea and
purpose of the stamp tax act is to evi
dence transactions, and It Is, in fact, not a
â¢ tax upon the instrument, but on the
; transaction. In consequence the question
arises, who is the beneficiary of the trans
action? It is not denied that the com
pany is thp beneficiary to the extent of
j its profit as a shipper of packages, but,
per so, the benefit of the transaction falls
to those between whom the commodities
pass through the agency of the shipping
i company. There is nothing in the act
, which denotes who shall pay the tax.
Even under the opinion of the I'nited
1 States Attorney General it is admitted
that the Government failed to direct who
shall pay this tax, the purpose of the law
! being fully subserved if all evidences of
i transactions bear the proper stamp, it
matters not who shall bear the burden of
taxation."
At this point Mr. Put.ro endeavored to
I Impress his contention upon thp court that
. the law was framed for the purpose of se
; curing the attention and service of the
corporations in enforcing the law and
! compelling the people to obey Its man
: dates. Quotations from a decision ren
dered by Judge Morrow, in which It was
held that in the opinion of the court the
penalty Imposed upon telegraph compa
nies of $Xi for accepting unstamped mes-
Bages and $100 upon individuals presenting
unstamped messages was for the purpose
of compelling senders of messages to bear
the tax, the penalty Imposed upon the
company for aceptJng unstamped m< s-
Bages having as its object the securing of
corporate assistance to enforce the law.
)!>â  claimed that the case was analogous
with that at bar, but Judge Troutt drew
a distinction between a message clearly of
interest between the sender, who prepared
such message, and the receiver, while a]
bill of lading or manifest was prepared ]
by the express company and issued for
the joint benefit of the company and the
shipper. In answer to this Mr. Sutro
quoted from section G of the war revenue i
law, which reads: "That on and after the
Ist day of July, 1898, there shall be levied,
collected and paid for and in respect of I
the several bonds, debentures or certifi
cates of stock and of Indebtedness, and
ether documents, instruments, matters
and things mentioned and described in
schedule A of this act, or for or in respect
of the vellum, parchment or paper upon
which such instruments, matters or I
things, or any nf them, shall be written
or printed by any person or persons or
party who shall make, sign or issue the
same, or for whose use or benefit the same
shall be made, signed of issued, the sev
eral taxes or sums of money set down in
figures against the same, respectively, or
otherwise specified or set forth in the said
schedule."
The words included in this section "by '
any person or persons or party who shall
make, sign or issue the same, or for whose
use or benefit the same shall be made,"
Mr. Sutro contended, plainly imposed the
burden on the people. Under Judge
Troutt's distinction, however, the com
pany was the "maker" and "Issued" the
instrument, and was equally a beneliciary.
The manifest or bill of lading being nec
essary for the successful conduct of its
business, the balance of reason Is certain
ly against the contentions of the corpora
tion, and under the wording of the sec
tion is legislated against more clearly
than are the people.
Replying to Mr. Sutro, Attorney General
Ford said that as far as the figures given
by opposing counsel were concerned he
did not consider that the burden was as
great as the company would have people j
think, as the learned counsel had neglect
ed to state just what the annual Income
of the company was. He also referred to
the fact that the company in its infancy,
In 1863, had been compelled to pay a tux
of 3 per cent on Its gross receipts, ami j
now, when its assets are valued by the
millions. 1t was trying to shirk its duty, j
After quoting additional authorities sub- j
stantlatinp his position that the company ]
must bear the tax. Mr. Ford spoke of a
conversation which he. had with Congress
man James G. Mnguire. In which that
ppntleman had told him that while the
very law In question was before the Ways I
and Means Committee General Grosvenor
of Ohio, when questioned, said that he did
not believe that the express companies
could evade the law, although they would
try. but he was unable to say what the
result would be if the company'endeavored
to shift the burden by raising rates. "That
matter we will attend to when it comes
up," said Attorney General Ford, "and
we will see that the laws in that respect,
as in the present case, are obeyed by this
corporation."

Finishes Even in Outrigger
Skiff Race With S. J.
Pembroke.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or., Aug. 21.â The weather
has been simply abominable to-day, and
the downpour seriously Interfered with
the programme which had been arranged
for the opening day's aquatic sports. De
spite this drawback, great .crowds came
to the city this morning, and the grand
stand and adjacent wharves were black
with people when the first event of the
day was announced. The coronation exer
cises were postponed until this evening,
when Miss Elmore was crowned at the
regatta ball. The queen, attended by the
maids of honor, entered the ballroom
shortly before 9 o'clock. Her Majesty
was then escorted to the throne, where
Admiral Day placed the crown upon her
brow. Mayor Bergman delivered an ad
dress oty welcome, which was responded
to by Governor Oeer.
Conditions being unfavorable for fast
time for the races, the great race between
the British Columbia four-oared crew and
the Alamedas was postponed until to
morrow. The personnel of the British
Columbia crew is as follows:
Richard Splnks, bow: Thompson, for
ward waist; George Seymour, afterwalst;
11. Alexander, stroke.
The first event called was the junior
outrigger skiff race. There were two
contestants l>-wi.- of the Alameda
Club and E. E. Sternberg of the Ariel
Club. Lewis seemed to have the best of
it coming home, but the boats were side
by side until the dtakeboat was rounded.
With half a mile to go, Lewis let himself
out and gradually drew away from Stern
berg, winning by four lengths.
Trie senior outrigger skiff race then fol
lowed. The contestants in the first heat
were: S. J. Pembroke of the Alamedas,
Dr. C. C. Dennis of the South Ends and
Patton of the Portland Rowing Club. The
water was not as smooth as the" men
would have had it. but they started off at
a terrillc pace. Pembroke and Dennis
soon outdistanced Patton and came home
bow and bow. First Pembroke's skiff
was a few inches ahead and then Dennis
took a slight ad. It was anybody' race
excepting Patton, who was twenty lengths
behind. Pembroke and Dennis crossed
the line at precisely the same moment
and the man behind the megaphone an
nounced a dead heat. The time for the
distance, a mile and a half, was 14 min
utes 49 seconds. A very strong tide was
running and the time was excellent con
sidering conditions.
When the second heat was announced
the tide had slackened. Ayres of Ala
niedas and Foley of the South Ends were
the contestants. The men were well to
gether until the last quarter of a mile
when Ayres took the lead and finished a
length ahead. The time was 13 minutes
37 1-5 seconds. The final will be rowed off
to-morrow.
Then the junior four-oarded barge race
was run. The University of California
boys and a crew of two men from San
Francisco and two from Portland were
entered. The picked crew had never seen
each other before this regatta, but they
proved too much for the Varsity boys,
who finished a length behind. The dis
tance was covered in 10 minutes 45 sec
onds.
The double pleasure boat race, entries,
to which were confined to members of the
Astoria Rowing Club, resulted in a vic
tory for Paul Trulllnger and Park*' Up
shur. who defeated John Young and
Charles Abercrombie, The boats fouled
twice.
The free-for-all sloop race, in which four
yachts entered, developed into, the most
exciting event of the day. The pretty
part of the race was the rescue of tho
crew of the yacht Blue Jacket by the Fort
Stevens life-saving crew. The Blue
Jacket had gone only about 750 yards
when she capsized, hut all hands were
saved. The Pearl also capsized and the
yachtsmen were picked Up. The White
Wings also met with an accident. Her
jib was carried away. The Dauntless was
th<Â» only vessel which sailed the race
without accident, and she finished with a
little natch of canvas fifteen minutes
ahead, of the White Wings. Four of the
twenty-footers started and three of them
finished. The fishing boats rode safely
through the gate, the winning boat, the
property of Mr. Gussnung. covering the
course in only 15 minutes 3S seconds' more
than the winner of the yacht race. The
cannery tender race was quite exciting.
The Alice won, the Frank Sanborn get
ting second place. The programme was
Interspersed with many other lesser but
Interesting events, one of which was the
Indian canoe contest. Brewer of San
Francisco easily won the swimming race
and later gave an exhibition of high and
fancy diving.

*^sv you do so, you will know exactly when the transport Sher
man has reached the homestretch and is about to enter the harbor.
Immediately after the ship is sighted by the Merchants' Exchange
The Call will send up from the dome of its building a box kite, the
same as used by the United States Weather Bureau. Attached to
this kite will be a sixteen-foot flag, which will be sent to a point
300 feet above the dome, thus making it 615 feet from the ground.
This will be of sufficient height to be seen not only by the resi

Every one will thus have the promptest kind of notification, and
can make his or her preparations accordingly for participating in
the welcome to "the boys.*' Be sure to keep your eve on the dome.

SPEEDY DOGS
DRAWN FOR THE
MIDWEEK STAKE
Union Park Arranges
a Good Card.
Contrary to its usual custom of holding
midweek coursing on Thursday, the Union
Park people will run off a sixty-four-dog
stake to-morrow. This course was decid
ed on atthe last meeting of the club, as
a majority of its patrons are anxious to
greet the California boys on their ar- |
rival In this city. -/. '-V-.
According to experts the drawing last
night resulted in the best midweek stake
in the history of the park. The grey
hounds chosen for the events are consid
ered the finest on the coast for a reserve
stake. It is expected the talent will have !
its hands full trying to pick a winner, as i
the dogs are evenly matched. Sixty-four I
speedy dogs are pitted against each other,
and as the hares are running strong some
keen sport will surely result. The prizes
offered are large and tempting. The win
ner will receive (60, the runner-up $40, the
r.ext two will land $20 each, the next four
$12 50, the next eight $7 50 and the next
sixteen $2 50 each. The rundown will be
Inaugurated at 11 o'clock Wednesday

OLYMPICS FORM
FOOTBALL TEAM
FOR THE SEASON
Thomas Code Elected
the Captain.
The Olympic Club is first nn the football
field this year. Last night a score of en
thusiastic gridiron athletes met in the
club building, and in a two-hour session
elected a captain and a manager for the
ensuing year. Tom Code will conduct the
destini.s of the winged O on the Held.
while Leon GreenebaGm will look out for
the managerial end of things.
The nie.tjtig was called to order by
Percy Morse, the most capable haifbacK
that ever wore the <>lympic colors. <;ath
ered about the secretary's table were ivte
Smith, captain of last years eleven: M<--
Nevin, Wilson, Stew-art Cotton, formerly
captain of Stanford varsity's team:
Sheeny, Le Ballister, Heller. Blame,
Hobbs, Krskine, Atkinson. Hamilton. Hel
ler. Code, Leader John Hammersmith, Me-
Lalne, George James and a few other ath
letes who will train for positions on the
Olympic club team. Several of the old
players. Smith. Sheeny and Morse, made
speeches, and after the gridiron celebri
ties Â« i re sufficiently aroused by the glow
ing prospects of a successful season the
balloting began.
Early in the season Pete Smith was a
candidate for the captaincy, but he with
drew last night in favor of Code, who
was unanimously chosen as the field
leader of the team. Code has been play
ing quarterback on the Olympic eleven
ever since he graduated from Stanford nn
1895. He is one of thf cleverest quarters
on the coast, and has practically cap
tained every team he has played on for
the last six years, his position necessitat
ing the giving of signals.
The new manager. Leon Oreenebaum. is
an arrlent admirer of the gridiron sport
and possesses strong financial ability. He
is the son of Sig Greenebaum, manager of
the London. Paris and American Bank,
and for many years has managed organiz
ations of an athletic nature.
The Olympic team will begin training in
two weeks. Their gridiron work will be
done in the armory riding ring on Pacific
street, near Larkin. Preliminary training
will commence at once, consisting of gym
nasium exercises. As soon as the team i
goes into systematic training and prac
tice a table will be established at the |
club. This will continue until the end of
th% season, when the team may go East!
if present plans do not miscarry.
The material from which the Olympics !
may pick a team this season was never'
better. Stewart Cotton is a host In him-
Belf and there is a strong likelihood that
Charles Fickert. another Stanford caY- ;
tain, will don the Olympic uniform this i
fall. Every indication of an exceptionally
strong team is apparent in the personnel!
of the candidates.
HIGH PRICED GAME.
A Hunter in Santa Clara Heavily I
Fined for Killing a Doe.
Santa <"'lam County has taken a splendid
stand in the matter of enforcing the game,
laws <>f the State. Last week, according
to the Information received t>y the Fish
and Game commission, one of her Jus- â 
tlcea of the Peace sentenced a person to!
one of the heaviest fines ever imposed in '
the county for killing; a female doer. Joe:
Jugim of San Francisco went into that
county last week and shot a doe. As soon
as the name warden there learned of the
offense he swore out a warrant for the ar
rest of the fellow, who was taken before
Justice Wallace Of San Jose and sen
tenced to pjay a line of $2TiO or be im
prisoned in the County Jail for fifty days.
The Information received here is that the
fine was paid after much trouble to the
man convicted.
<in two other occasions similar fines
were imposed, but under different clrcum-
Btances. A man whose disregard for the
law was so deep seated that he deliber
ately shot two deer near Bartlett Springs
was fined $250 for each offense, and he
took both cases to the Supreme Court to
have the constitutionality of the law
tested After he had paid out several :
thousand dollars in fighting the cases he ,
was obliged to acknowledge that the law |
against killing deer out of season or doe j
at any time was constitutional.
The commissioners state that by the |
time a few more hunters are thus fined
for breaking the laws the general commu
nity will awake to a realization that game
killed out of season, etc., comes too high
for the majority.
GOOD PRIZE FIGHT.
A. Herrera Defeats Billy de Coursey I
in Fifteen Rounds.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 21.â A. Herrera
of Bakersfleld defeated Billy de Coursey j
of this city in the fifteenth round of what j
was to have been a twenty-round boxing
contest here to-night. De Coursey's sec
onds threw up the sponge, but their man
was already down and all but counted
out. Herrera weighed more than De
Coursey and was the stronger man
throughout. In the fourteenth round he
had De Coursey on his knees four times
and he stayed down the limit each time.
It was a hard-fought battle all the way i
through. The men are lightweights. The
Bghi took place before the new Southern
California Athletic Club.
Young Peter Jackson of San Francisco
and Jim Trimble of this city were
matched to a contest before the Los An

In full view of hundreds of passengers,
a young and unknown man leaped to

deliberate, and he immediately disap
peared, leaving nothing except the hat
which he wore to furnish a clew for iden

The Oakland was on her C o'clock trip
from San Francisco to the Oakland mole. |
There were hundreds ol 1 pie on board
and many of them crowded forward on
the lower deck, eager to make a hasty
landing when the vessel entered the slip:
In the crowd was a young man. well !
dressed, smooth shaven and apparently |
about 2J years of age. He attracted no ,
I particular attention and spoke to no one. !

The many who were witnesses to the
tragic act were powerless to Intervene.'
It was all over in an instant. Just as the 'â 
. man struck the water he uttered a cry.
anil sinking, appeared to have been drawn
j under the boat. There was a scene of I
I wild commotion on deck immediately
; after the deed had been committed, and
] several of the woman passengers fainted
'at the sight. The boat was stopped with

GRAND CIRCUIT RACES.
READVILLE, Mass.. Aug. 21.â The I
grand circuit fixture for the Readville
mile track began this afternoon. The
track was fast and the attendance large.
Only one favorite reached winning money,
ana he did bo without giving the others a
chance. The Futurity event for three
year-olds, won by Idollta, 2:21 1 , i. was
faster than the favorite, Extacy, could
go, although the latter was booked to win :
even after two heats. Idolita each time i
dropped the field at the quarter and lead- ,
iva; ail around finished easily enough to
keep down his mark. Extacy managed â 
to get second in the first heat and was
likely in the third, but broke at the three- I
quarters.
With beautiful starts each time the race i
was one of the best for foals ever seen
o*n thi.s track. Idolita's share is $7500, and !
Mamie W.s $1700.
The Neponset stake had Hal B, 2:044, |
for the favorite, and as his mark was so
much better than the class it was not ;
suprising that he showed the way all I
around. In the third heat Montas I
Crookes, 2:09. came up to the finish in â 
pretty good tftyle and threatened to dis- i
pute the heat, but Hal B let out again I
and won by a length. Moth Miller did the (
best trotting of the field, for each time j
he was fourth to the three-quarters, i
where he forced Arlington and Castleton
so that they nad to slow up to keep their
feet. Miller would then aiow up on the
finish stretch, making Hal B's lead really ]
better than it need be, while in two heats | '
there was no horse to dispute with Miller '
the right to second place.
The 2:12 class pacing was won by Fair- '
view. 2:13 1 /j, an outsider, after Free Bond, '
2:ll 1 /5. the great favorite, had miserably '
failed to get inside the distance flag In '

out with a bad case of La. Grippe, as well as Lumbago and Rheumatism. Inside of ..
four days' use of the Belt the Lumbaco and Rheumatism were completely removed. .
and after two weeks every sign of the other troubles disappeared. To me it has been j
the. cheapest investment I have. ever made, and it will-be a pleasure to state what It j
has done for me. Yours very truly. . *

THE SULU TREATY.
* â I â 'H li country heard with some surprise the
I 'III" country heard with Sultan surprise the
proposition to pay to the Sult.ni ol the Sulus
* an annual subsidy for submitting to our juris
diction and the transfer of sovereignty to his part of
the Philippine* from Spain to us. li Spain had a valid
title to sell "and we bought ii the goods purchased be
longed to us, without hiring anybody to say so.
There was no more reason for subsidizing the Ma
hometans of the Sulus than for treating in like man
no- the Christians of the rest of the group.
This first surprise is increased by the report that
General Bates is visiting the Sulus and making a
treaty with them! If Spain passed to us a valid title
why do we recognize these Mahometans as a nation
capable of entering into the treaty relation? What
right have they to such recognition thai does not
equally belong to the Christian Filipinos? These are
questions that will run until they are answered. The
solicitude of this country reinforces its curiosity as
the features of the treaty are exploited. According to
its terms we are to leave polygamy and chattel
slavery among the Sulus undisturbed, but our juris
diction is to be acknowledged and our flag is to fly
over the islands and weVarc to pay the Sultan a
salary larger than any paid to any officer of the
United States except the President. General Bates
hastened to make it known that this treaty pro
vides that chattel slaves in the Sulus may buy their
freedom. He says that the Sultan objected to tin..
but was appeased by inserting the proviso that the
slave must buy his freedom at the market price. . As
the slave-owner makes the market and puts his price
upon a slave whom he wishes to sell, the benefit of
this clause to the chattel is of a questionable nature.
The slaves in this country, before emancipation, were
always given the same right The master would al
ways let a slave buy himself, and the instances were
numerous in which a slave would buy himself and his
wife and children, but this did not soften the hard
features of the institution to the minds of the anti
slavery Republicans, who bravely made their first
platform declare that polygamy and slavery were the
twin relics of barbarism.
The Civil Wai was the costly means employed to
put an end to slavery and all of its incidents, and
when a million of men had fallen in battle and tour
billions of treasure had been spent in the struggle, it
was by amendment written into the Federal constitu
tion that slavery and involuntary, servitude are for
bidden in the United States "and all places subject to
their jurisdiction."
We are spending eight hundred thousand dollars a
day in a military adventure to establish our jurisdic
tion in the Philippine Islands. The Sulu treaty is for
the avowed purpose of asserting our purchased sov
ereignty of that part of the Philippines and to extend
our jurisdiction withouf the cost ot conquest. Ihe
Sulus now come under our jurisdiction and the
stars and stripes ttv there, but at the cost ot legalizing
and protecting both polygamy ;>.nd slavery! A Lin
coln Republican will despair of finding reasons for
such a policy. Of course, like the rest of the
schemes now afoot it is borrowed from Great Britain.

But she is not under a written constitution. Accord

church was surprised to find that under its canon law

Colenso oi Natal made it a practice to receive into

tain this year promises well. The State is flourishing
in all lines of industry and the people are prosper
ous. The directors have appealed in the right way
to turn the attention of the producers ami the manu
facturers to the advantages of the fair to exhibitors,
and the result can hardly fall short of something like
a genuine triumph.
The London Saturday Review sneering!}' says that
a few music hall ditties and alter dinner Speeches rep
resent the substantial benefits to England from the
" taglo American alliance." England probably never
will forget the ditty to which her troops marched in
defeat forever from the American soil. Hut "Yankee
Doodle" is not the end ni Uncle Sam's musical ideas.
THE SIEGE OF GUERIN.
BY all odds the cleverest display of strategy the
Parisian police have shown the world for many
a year is that by which they have turned
Gucrin's attempted revolution into a jest and a joke
for the railery of the boulevards and the merriment
of the world The siege of Guerin is in fact about
the brightest opera bouffe ever enacted on a munici
pal stage of the first class. ~
The bellicose Guerin has long been able by the
slashing tongue of him to talk valiantly as a leader
in the movement to save France and the rest of the
nations from the cosmopolitan plutocracy of the Jews.
He has' been mighty of jaw in the Dreyfus fight, and
had he been a Samson he would with that jaw have
slaughtered thousands. When the Court of Cassa
tion ordered a new trial for Dreyfus the vehement
| Guerin resolved to act. He organized a band, which
was something like a brass band, something like a
wind band, something like a jewsharp and something
like a barrel organ. It was a resolute body of men
determined on revolution, and when it saw approach
ing a body of police it took not the field, but Guerin's
house, fortified it-elf and called from the windows
upon the people to strike for their altars and their
homes, Guerin and liberty.
The police declined to treat Guerin seriously. In
stead of battering down his door and dragging him
squealing through the streets to prison, they simply
put a guard around his house, shut off his gas and
water, refused admittance to his baker, his butcher
and his grocery man. and left him to harangue his
band on the virtues of holding the fort upon an
empty stomach.
From the start Guerin has been dissatisfied with
such treatment. He issued on the first day of the
siege a manifesto to Paris in which he declared that
on the .-. â  following the police, aided by the army,
would storm his fortress home and the Parisian
would see how a hero can die. He invited one and
all to attend the sacrifice, and promised if they did
not rise to save him he would die for them and give
them a show worth the price of admission.
The great day came, but the police did nothing.
Some ot the more sympathetic of the crowd tinr^
loaves of bread and canned luxuries through the open
windows and Guerin feasted and talked nd was well
satisfied with himself. Day by day, however, he has
grown sadder as well as thinner. On Saturday some
of his friends undertook to throw a leg of mutton an i
a five-pound loaf ot bread through the window, but
missed, and the police confiscated the leg and the
loaf as contraband of war.
The mighty heart of the revolutionist nearly broke
when he witnessed the confiscation. He had recourse
at once to his never- failing tongue.
"In the nineteenth century you try. to starve peo
plÂ«. It is disgraceful. You." he added, addressing
the policemen, "you ought to have more heart than
your masters and ought to give us back our provi
sions. In any case, I warn you that the first time my
companions are hungry it a prefect of police passes
along the street we will shoot him."
While this farce goes on in Paris the Dreyfus case
drags on at Rennes. The tragedy and the opera
bouffe move along together. Nature is no respecter
of dramatic properties. She mixes the buffoon's an
tics with the sufferings ot heroes, and holds stead
lastly on her impartial way between the two; but as
different from one another as is the rat in the pit
from the lion in the toils, is the screaming revolu
tionist shouting defiance from his windows ...
heroic prisoner asserting his innocence and confront
ing his foes at Rennes.
* I: is said that the court-martial will again rind
Dreyfus guilty of treason. This it can never do. It
may convict the celebrated prisoner, but its power
to prove him guilty has pass More thoroughly
perhaps than any other man of modem times Dreyfus
has been judged by the civilized world and the verdict

HIS WIFE IN
SELF DEFENSE
Keenan Testifies in
His Own Behalf.
HE CLAIMS SHE STABBED HIM
EXHIBITS HIS CUT VEST TO THE |
TRIAL JURY.
Â«
The Evidence Is Now All In. the
Case Will B? Argued and Then
Submitted for a
Verdict.
Patrick Keenan, better known as Patsy
Hogan! ex-prizefighter; politician and fire
man] took the stand yesterday morning In
Judge Dunne's court und testified that
when he sped the bullet that caused his
wife's death and landed him in a mur-
Jerer'a ceil he didjso in defense of his life.
He said that his dead wife plunged a
knife Into his breast three times before
be shot her, and as he pulled the trigger
nis strength gave out from loss of blood
arid l.- fell back on the bed. When the
jfflcers came he was still lying on the bed
uid the knife was still buried a. third of !
is length in his tle&h.
When Keenan took the stand he first
gave a brief history of the troubles that \
led to a separation between himself and
his wife, finally reaching the day of the !
tragedy. He said that after dinner en
that day he and his wife went into an
adjoining room, where he again appealed
to her to forget the past and again take
Up life with him. To his appeals she had
but one answer, "I don't love you any
more, Keenan, and I ne*er will live with
you again." "is there some other man
you love?" he said, and she answered,
"Yes, there Is, but it's none of your d
business who it is."
"1 told her that she was in a had bu- .
mor," continued Keenan, "and was telling
me that which was not true. 1 never
doubled her fidelity, so her words ha I but
little â¢it et on me. and then I said to her,
â¢Well. Anna, kiss me and I will go." She r
was pulling: the string of a shoe and said;
'Give me jour knife. â¢â¢Man.' I did so
and then started to put my arm around
her neck l to kiss her when she stabbed
me. 1 felt a burning sensation and '0 ild !
feel the blood running down my breast.
I started to unbutton my clot I to se-j
how bad 1 was injured when she same
up behind me and again stabbed me. She
was between me and the door, and as I ,
started out 1 was again stabbed, ?o I
drew mv revolver and struck her on the
head. She screamed and grappled itif,
and then the pistol went off once. twice,
perhaps three times. Then l fainted, t
pn^ss. as I remembered nothing from
that time until I awoke in the Receiving
Hospital."
Keenan then showed his cut vest to th*
jury, and besides exhibited powder marks
on. his face, which, he said, were caused
by the explosion of the pistol when his '
wife, grappled with him. He further tes
tified that his wife once called at the en- i
gine house where- he was employed and I
asked him for her father's watch and I

THE AMERICAN SHIP KENILWORTH SECURING A CREW AFTER

TO-NIGHT THE
PENNSYLVANIA
MEN GO HOME
No 111 Feeling Toward
Californians.
The Pennsylvania men will be mustered
nut to-day and to-nipht they will start
for their homes. It Is a two-battalion
regiment and the process of paying off
will not take so long on thai account, bo
the regiment should be able to get away
easily at the hour it has decided uponâ
â I o'clock from the Oakland mole. There
will be no parade of the regiment through
the streets. Each man will make his own
way to the ferry and over to the trains
waiting on th.- mole.
el Barnett declares the regiment
San Francisco with every feeling
of gratitude to the people of the city
and of esteem for the First Regiment. He
is particularly emphatic about this, for
all kinds of statements about the rela
tions between the Pennsylvania men and
the California men ha\.- been put In cir
culation. From the first story that the
California men s.'iot into che Pennsyl
vania Regiment at the battle of Malate
to the yarn that the California men were
sent to Negros [sland to prevent trouble
between the two regiments, there has
been said nearly everything that can be
Imagined. All these stories Colonel Bar
nett denies. At Malate, he says, the Cali
fornia nun were In the rear of tb< Pc n
sylvania men for a venue, but it was
something that was likely to happen at
any time. The report had it that the
WATCH THE DOME OF THE CALL BUILDING.
KEEP your eye on the dome of the tallest structure in town. If
you do so. you will know exactly when the transport Sher
man has reached the homestretch and is about to enter the harbor.
Immediately after the ship is sighted by the Merchants' Exchange
The Call will send up from the dome of its building a box kite, the
same as used by the United States Weather Bureau. Attached to
this kite will be a sixt^n-foot flsg, which will be sent to a point
300 feet above the dome, thus making it 615 feet from the ground.
This will be of sufficient height to be seen not only by the resi
dents of San Francisco, but also by thosa of the neighboring towns.
Every one will thus have the promptest kind of notification, and
can make his or her preparations accordingly for participating in
the welcome to "the boys." Be sure to keep your eye on the dome.
California men had killed half a dozen
Pennsylvaniaâ¢. Colonel Barnett says
there was but' one mar. of his command
shot in the back at Ma late. He was a
man named Bradley, who was on out
last duty, and before he could get back
to the line the fight opened. He was in
front of the California men, but he was
also in front of his own comrades, who
were between him and the CaHfornia^reg-

own regiment as well as by any other

MERCHANT OTA GETS
A HABEAS CORPUS WRIT
CLAIMS THAT HE IS REALLY
A RESIDENT MERCHANT.
Genpral Barnes Will Plead His Case
Before Judge De Haven in ths
Federal Court T o-Day.
W. H. L. Barnes applied to United
States Judg< de Haven yesterday for a
writ of habeas corpus "ii behalf "f S.
Ota, a Japanese, who bad been denied a
landing by United States Immigration
< 'ommissioner North.
The petition for the writ recited that
Ota Is an American citizen and a taxpayer
of tli" city and countj of Ban Francisco
and "f tlii' State of California; that he Is
;, member of the firm of Ota & Sanada,
dealers In Japanese goods at 1518 l'<>lk
street, and has been a resident ol San
Francisco for <-iu r ht years. The petition
â¢ avers that Ota returned to Japan
â  March for the purpose >>f buying
wherewith to replenish his stock,
:in<i thai he did so purchase about $5000
worth That he returned on the Hong-
Is â  g Maru on August 5, and after being
pxamlned by the State anÂ«l Federal quar-
antine officers was given free pratique,
but that he was debarred from landing by
United States Immigration Commissioner
North on the ground 'that Ota was an
alien immigrant and afflicted with a loath
some disease. ' The petition denies both
charges.
General Barnes in presenting the peti
tion complained thai Ota was kept with
out food or water or bed clothing from
Friday until Sunday, and that when his
partner. Sanada, went with necessaries
for Ota the things were rudely taken
away from him, and Sanada was, meta
phorically, kicked downstairs.
Judge de Haven set this morning at 11
o'clock as the time for the production of
Ota in court.

TRAFFIC MEN RETURN.
Slubbs nnd McCormick Make an Im

Messrs. Stubbs, McCormick and Sprouie
of the traffic department of the Southern

ing from t lie prolonged visit they have
been makinp in the Blast, and which was
uti't rtaken for the purpose of introducing

exercises control over.
While In Chicago these gentlemen at
tended a meeting of .he Western, North

executive officers there to convene and
talk over matters of general Interest, for
tin purpi â 'â¢ of arriving at a more saus

ends nf tlvir various roads. What were
the particular interests to be looked after
by the Southern Pacific officials Mr.

was to be done, and they sat in to be

The only important change that has yet
manifested itself as a result of the trip Is

THE KENILWORTH
SECURES A CREW
OF ABLE SEAMEN
All Hands Disliked
First Mate.
After lying eleven days in the stream
awaiting a crew the American ship Kenil
worth will probably pet away to-day. A
crew was put aboard, but when the men I
found thai li. St. Clair, late of the Dfr-
Igo, was lirst mat-- they refused to X" in
the ship. Si. Clair had trouble with the
crew of the Dirigo during the voyage from
New York to Yokohama, and the sailors
remembered It. Finally Captain Taylor
had tM let St. Clair go and ship John
Boyce in his place. Then the sailors ob- !
jected to a lot of "green" hands that
formed part of the crew, and these were i
put ashore yesterday and A. R.s shipped
in their place. The Kenilworth will now
get away without any further delay.
Captain "Nick" Roslch Is now master
of the schooner Occidental, Captain
Brandt having- been promoted to the man- i
agership of Gray & Mitchell's office at
Eureka. Rosich was formerly master of
the schooner Fortuna. He and Captain
Brandt had a bet of a new hat over the J
sailing qualities of their vessels, with tl.e i
result that a race to Bureka was ar
ranged. The Fortuna easily outsailed tbe
1 ' 'â > Idental, and Captain Rosicb was jubi
lant. Now. however, that he has been
given the command of the Occidental,
which is a much larger vessel, he is cer
tain that his new boat can beat the For
tuna. t'aptain Luberg, late first mate of
the Occidental, is now captain of the
Fortuna, and is ready at any time to give
Captain Rosich a race.
The tug Reliance was out on the bay

SEAMEN SUSPENDED.
Captains O. F. Bollrs and J. K. Bulger '
United States inspectors of local and for
eign steam vessels, rendered a decision
yesterday suspending for thirty days the
licenses of N. Holler, mister, and Patrick
Hayes, engineer of the steamer Sea Gull
for negligence.
The steamer arrived at Spear street
whart on July 2U with a cargo of salt
from Mount Bden Creek. As soon as she
was made fast the captain went home
without having left any instructions to
his two deck hands and his engineer as
to the care of the vessel, she being in a
li ;iky condition. At 5 o'clock the next
morning the steamer capsized at the
wharf, and the crew, who were sleeping
on board, barely managed to escape
drowning.
The inspectors censured Master Moller '
for negligence In leaving the steamer in !
such a condition, and included Engineer I
Hayes, because he failed to report to the
United Star.;- inspectors the fact that the
Bteamer was leaking.

Brings News.
ALL MECHANICS ARE WORKING
DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GET

Say He Induced Members of His Party
in Congress to VoteTw-nty Mil

rolonel John P. Irish. Naval Officer at
this i>ort, lias just returned from a flying
visit to the East. He spent four days
in Washington and several days in Du
buque, la., his old stamping ground.
Colonel Irish reports a greal increase In
the demand for manufactured iron and
steel products, which demand be ascribes
to the substitution of metal for wood in
large buildings. The industry is thriving
remarkably all throughout the Bast, and
all the establishments are running full
blast. There are very few if any compe
tent mechanics unemployed. But, strange
as it may appear, the men who furnish
the ore are not getting the benefit of the
increased price f'>r the iron products, they
bring now engaged in filling contracts
made prior to the boom, ami they will all
be happy when they shall have finished
these contracts, wages in the metal
workers' departments also have risen.
There is also an Increased demand for
aluminum for electrical work, it being be
lieved to be as good us copper for that
purpose and having the advantage of
lightness.
Colonel Irish saw many indications
while In the East that (julte an influential
element\ln the Democratic parts- is try
ing to unload William J. Bryan off the
back of the party, but he doubted whether
the attempt would be successful. Bryan's
action in getting Democratic votes in i'i>n
gres= to ratify the peace treaty with
Spain and to pay that nation $20,000,000 for
the Philippines was inconsistent with his
later course and utterances. The propo
sition to subsidize the Sultan of Sulu and
to allow the Mohammedans of that island
to practice polygamy has created a strong
feeling in the East, such a concession br
ing believed to he repugnant to the prin
ciples underlying the 1 nited States con
stitution. Colonel Irish found the Dem
ocracy badly muddled and not nearly so
strong or compact in organization as it
was during the last Presidential cam

The European competitive plans for the
University of California consigned to Mrs.
Phebe Hearst arrived from Paris yester
day and were at once passed through the
Custom-house. M. Tussaud, the repre
sentative at Paris of the university, stated
in the Invoice mat the plans were valued
at 120,000 francs, which is equivalent to
|23,fi00 in United States gold coin. Ap
praiser Dare assessed the duty at $6000,
Customs Brokers P. W. Belllngall, repre
senting Mrs. Hearst, and George Reed,
representing the university, called upon
Port Collector Jackson and laid the mat
ter before him. The Collector agreed to
make a strong appeal to the Secretary of
the Treasury to have the plans admitted
duty free, the valuation being preposter
ous and made for the purpose of insur
ance.
In the meantime Messrs. Bellingall and
Reed furnished a bond in the sum of $60,

Secretary of the Treasury shoulu so or

PHYSICAL TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT.
"There are plenty of men," said a
vanquished knight of the saw-dust
arena, recently, "'who could win laurels
in the ring: were it not for certain ifs,
and they are not of very huge propor-
tions either."
"Do you mean that the men are not
very big?" asked a bystander.
"No. the ifs," was the reply. "You
see It is this way. Men don't take care
of themselves. See? They let a weak-
ness or disease get the better of them
before they go to a doctor who knows
his business, and they're Boon goners."
That the above statement contains
more truth than poetry no sane man
will deny. The ex-pugilist should have
added, however, that specialists of
known integrity and ability, who cure
nothing but disease and weakness of
men, should be consulted.
Dr. Meyers & Co., the noted special-
ists, have devoted more than eighteen
years to the study of all diseases and
weakness of men. Their staff is com-
posed of physicians and surgeons of the
highest standing, graduates from the
best schools and hospitals of both
America and Europe.
They make no charge for consulta.
tion Or advice, and furnish without cost
.to the patient all the remedies, appli-
ances, etc.. necessary to effect a quick
and permanent cure.
As a guarantee I>r. Meyers & Co. will
let the patient deposit the price of a
cure In any bank In San Francisco, try
be paid to Dr. Meyers & Co. after he is
entirely well. If it is not convenient
t.i do "this payments may be made In
weekly or monthly installments.
There are men in every city, town

EASTERN MARKETS
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Aug. â  21.â There was. a battle
royal between the .hulls and the bears on the
Ptock Exchange to-day. . The bulls had some
what the. advantage of position, as they were
a ntre'nehed behind a large and well distributed
i]"niand for .stocks of all varieties. Commission
ho\isÂ«". business was on a very large scale and
the movement of prices' in th- majority of the
list was varied throughout the day, realizing
going on in a liberal way at one portion of the
list, while prices were marked up in another.
One or two stocks showed conspicuous strength,
but the tendency to advance In the railroad
list was surprisingly -uniform and took in all
grades of stacks from the highest to the. low
priced issues.' Bui there were. spots in the. in
dustrial, list which proved exceedingly vul
nerable and the persistent determination with
which the bears raided these resulted in wip
ing out the majority of gains wHich had been
achieved in the railroads, and a reduction of
practically' all that remained to fractiqnal
limits. Brooklyn Transit suffered the severest
attack from the bears all day long. It was of
fered down through successive stages, each drop
bringing out a deluge of long stock and copious
ptop-loss orders. The success of the bears with
this stock encouraged them to extend their at
tack to nther members 'if the so-called Flower
prou'p. They forced down International Paper
an extreme eight points, and. Federal Steel
suffered to the extent of 3%. People's Gas lost
over two points and Rock Island a point. The
extent Of the decline Invited hasty covering:
and there were rallies of one to three points
In the group. Manhattan, Metropolitan Street
Kail-way and Third-avenue . showed wide de
clines in sympathy, ranging from .2% to 4'.j In
the cÂ«se of the first two named Sugar was
also vulnerable after an early sain of a point
find dropped nearly two points. Steel and
V. ire showed a remarkably drooping tendency
and other iron and steel stocks were also
heavy. The influence .this weakness In the.
railroad list was accentuated by a late mark
ing up. .of call loans to per. cent after hav
ing ruled at and below 3 per cent during the
early part Of the day. The fact remains that
a large portion of the day's business in the
list -was .done at prices above Saturday's.
There was an enormous absorption of stock
from the opening In spite of the rather heavy
tone reflected from foreign stock markets on
Â«ccount of disorders In Paris and the uneasi
ness over the political season- and the spread
Of thÂ» bubonic plague. Tennessee Coal rose
buoyantly 4'< percent to par In the first few
minutes of trading.'- It went back during the
day to 57,/ but dosed- at 99. ' Louisville con
tinue^ In active demand and sold up to 83%.
A number of low-priced stocks, notably Denver
nnd Rio Grande and Northwestern, were in
good -demand and th" large organized buying
of Southern Pacific was continued. This stock
was held back by realizing and did not at any
time rise more than a small fraction, over Sat
urday. Stocks .of railroads In Colorado were
uniformly strong. on the improved conditions
In the mining Industry of that State. Atchlson
preferred, the Grangers, the Coalers. Baltimore
nnd Ohio stocks and Union Pacific were in
large demand. Very little remains of the early
gains In these stocks, which' reached a point
or over In a number of cases. American To
bacco ends with Â» gain of nearly 2 points.
There were a number of other more obseuro
stocks which showed strength during the day.
The bond market showed Increased activity
in sympathy with stocks. . There were con
spicuous gains In Southern Pacific 4s. Colorado

Chicago Grain Market.
4 : *.
CHICAGO, Auk. 21.â wheat opened weak at
a decline of about 'â¢â ,<â  for both the September
and December options, between which trading;
was about equally divided. â  Foreign markets
were higher, though they hardly showed the
advance expected. But Russia, the Wheat
crop of which country was reported Saturday
to have suffered so. much as to preclude the
possibility of exports, reported shipments of
over a million bushels. Domestic crop con
ditions showed a big improvement and this
more than anything else influenced for the time
being the action of the market. Rains in the
Northwest had ceased and the weather was re
ported ideal for the crop. As a great deal
of buying was done last week on account of
apprehension of damage from the rains the
changed conditions brought Wheat into the
market in large quantities at around the open
ing and resulted In more or less liquidation
all day. The visible supply statement showed
a disappointingly small decrease, 19,000 bushels
instead of the 1.00n.00G bushels expected. The
general cash business was so small as not to
affect the speculative market, though bids
were not altogether out of the way, as was
shown by the working of about 40,000 bushels
of Kansas Wheat and by reports of other small
lots received. The market ran stop-loss orders
when it got below puts and though there was
considerable covering at the decline the mar
ket responded slowly to the buying and ruled
heavy to the end. September closed at 715.
--and December at 73% c.
Corn was quite active and weak. Prices were
Irregular at the start, but sellers were in a
majority and carried the prices steadily down
ward. September closed â¢>i*'a 7 ic lower.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
The sensation of the day Is the advance in
bale rope to ISc. The Hay farmer seems to
be catching it all around this year. The deal
era say that this will react upon the rope
manufacturers, for It Will lead the farmers
to use wire after this. Wire Is used through
out the East, and as It costs only one-third
as much as rope It will probably be more
freely used here in the future.
Receipts of Hay were excessively heavy, be
ing 1340 tons, and the market was extremely
weak In consequence, though there was no
positive decline.

The report from the Ophlr mine for the
week is as follows:
On Monday morning, jointly with the Mexi
can Company, we started work in our shaft.
Since that time we have been able to reach
the 1000-foot level and found the shaft to be
In a fair condition. The stations, however,
will require considerable repairs. Central tun
nelâThe Joint Mexican west crosscut was ad
vanced 24 feet; total 104 feet; face In soft vein
porphyry. During the week a part of the north
drift, "trom which the joint crosscuts are run,
was timbered, as the ground was heavy and
threatening. Sutra tunnel connectionâ The ai
rect connection drift was extended 24 feet,
total B*6 feet; face in hard porphyry with seams
of clay. The formation in the face is chang
ing The south drift has been timbered and
extended 5 feet; total length 42 feet; face in
quartz and porphyry. The southwest drift has
been extended 8 feet; total length 93 feet. The
face is in clay and vein porphyry, the vein
having narrowed to a small seam of quartz
between clay walls. .
In the Chollar and Potosl mines the joint
west tunnel has been advanced during the
week 27 feet; total length, 433 feet; face in clay
and porphyry. Have one man on repairs In
parts of the mine. The joint Bullion-Potosl
west crosscut has "been advanced 12 feet; total
Jength. 317 feet; face in porphyry. Sutro tun

levelâ The west drift has been advanced through,
porphyry and quartz a distance of 24- feet;
total length 818 feet. 1650 Making nec
essary repairs here. 1750 levelâ From the end
of the west crosscut from the. sill floor or the
south drift have raised and connected with
the small southwest drift from the second
floor of the stopes. "We are drifting north from
this point and have reached the old raise men
tioned in previous reports. The ore that was
encountered five weeks ago in the southwest
drift, 17 feet from the track, was cut in the
progress of the north drift and proved to be
only a small bunch. At the present end of
our north drift we have some bunches of good
ore around the ' bottom of the raise. In the
stopes the raise from the bottom of the fourth
floor was carried up one set, making the eighth
set from the sill floor. From 'this top set a
small drift was run 23 feet west and an open
ing was made into the south drift on the 1700
level. This drift is being enlarged and tim
bered. A good circulation of air has been
obtained by making this connection. A timber
chute is being put in up to the top set at the
Btopes. 1800 levelâ West crosscut 1. started
from the south drift SO feet from the winzÂ»
station, has been advanced 20 feet; total length
52 feet. The formation passed through is
rather hard porphyry, with some bunches of
low grade quartz and a clay seam three inches
thick has been cut. Resumed work in the face
of the south drift, cleaned it out and retim
bered for a distance of 30 feet; total length 205
1 fett. The material passed through gave assays
I ranging from $3 to $6 per ton. 1950 levelâAt

LOOKING INTO
NEW FACES AT
THE THEATERS
Clay Clement in His |
Own Comedy.
"A Southern Gentleman," is falsely
tagged by Mr. Clement a romantic com
ply. The spirit of romance is not for a
moment present. In fact spirit of any
kind is absolutely lacking, Bave in the
prologue, which la sensational and realis
tic in Intention, though robbed of its best
< â â ffi'i-ts by the wooden Inexpi rli nee with
whi< h Lleuteant Thompson, Mr. Oscar
Norfleet, handled ins death. The purpose
of the prologue Is to foreshadow the plot,
but the play would be Quite as interesting
as it is with no plot ut all. It is simply ;
together of scenes and Inci- i
dents of Southern life, which it was an
tlon to connect. Mr. Clement lias
reached out for atmosphere and failed to
grasp it. The exaggerated â  sy of
old Carolina days must be very perfectly
pictured nowadays to prove Interesting.
This very exotic . - was romantic
and decorative in satin shorts, powder
and patches, but to-day we care for more
â  cake and less of tne frosting. Be
sides the play is weighted with character
parts, one for each man of the company,
and character actors are few. it musi be
terrible to be condemned through three
acts and a prologui to talk In dialect you
cannot quite master. At first it condemns
you to the commonplace, and when this
; asses it deprives your remarks of '
their true outline of Intention. Some sen
mal . xit.- appealed to the gallery, l>ut j
iwer house wap quietly resi
and subdued. The dialogue is stilled, not
In a literary but in a sentimental way.
and it is overcharged with lay Bermons
trite philosophy. To criticise Mr.
Clement la a restricted privtlegf â the
privilege of such as are able to do it. The
part he has written for himself Is not a
good one. it is a sort of living picture,
ated at times by romantic aensations.
!i.- did b< me subtle and studied acting in
parts and carried an air of gentleness and
nigh-bred courtesy throughout the play,
but those who have se< n "Th< Ni w I r -
minion" will never dfvorci their affections
from Hohenstauffen to attach them to
â â  .1 Carroll. Mrs. Clement was over
icd in her acting of Arzelia; Miss
O'Malley made a good Mammy I.indy,
and Mr. Williams an artistic Hannibal.
Mr. Cook recalled the roue In "Tine of Our
Girls," and had an uninteresting part.
las O'Malley controlled his brogue
well, and the other members of the cast
read their parts honestly, despite occa
sional wavering of intention. Personally,
I had rather mourn with Hedda Gabler
than sleep through "A Southern ("Jentle

Tivoli.
A prominent characteristic of the new
school of operatic composition is the good
I quality of the music, notwithstanding a
tendency to suit the popular taste. It is
ise Of this fact that the double bill
oi "Cavalleria Rusticana" and "I Pagli
; acci" will never fail to please the treas
-1 urer of a theater. Furthermore the com
posers of this modern class of composition
bave bo well succeeded In molding grate
ful melodies that a fairly good singer who
had any schooling at all must needs be
; successful with their execution, provided
that he combine with a good voice a
i knowledge of dramatic declamation. In
both the above mentioned operas human
passion Is exemplified, and not unless a
1 vocalist Is able to Infuse the temperament
, of the Italian into the arias can he expect
to be successful.
The performam c of "Pagliacci" must be
i ranged among the very !â â¢ Bt ever wit
! nessed in this city. The sensation of the
ievening was Barron Becthald'fl Canio,
Thus far last night's work was the best

GAS MATTERS
BOTHER THE
SUPERVISORS
Crockett Says He Will
Turn Out Lights.
The Supervisors found more trouble
than they could dispose of at one meeting
waiting for them yesterday, and as a re- |
suit municipal affairs are In a mess that |
will require the balance of the vacation
period to untangle. The vote whereby the
last tux levy was adopted was recons'd- |
ered; a resolution repealing the anti-pool
Belling order was passed to print; the gas
lighting specifications were reread and
amended, and incidentally J. B. Crockett
Stepped i*n to announce that unless his
company's bills were paid on the spot the
lity's supply of gas would be chut off on
Wednesday night. The bills were not paid
and it remains for Wednesday to arrive
to demonstrate whether or not Mr.
Crockett was flaunting his usual bluff.
The resolution to rescind the ami-jiool-
Helling order was offered at the last min
ui.' by Supervisor Black. Its adoption
was seconded by Supervisor Aigeliinger.
Supervisor Perrault moved that it be
passed to print, and Mayor Phelan ruled
that that was the proper procedure, as a
resolution to repeal must take the s-tmu
course as the measure which it seeks to j
eliminate. Perrault'a motion prevailed by
a vote of 7 to 5, Aigeltlnger, AttrKjge,
Black, Collins, Holland, Perrault and
Phelps voting aye. The motion to patÂ»a to
I print practically kills the resolution, as it
: will have to pass through the Mayor*
hands, and he unofficially announced yes
terday that he would veto it.
The motion whereby the vote by which
the tax levy was adopted was made by
Deasy. A communication from the Audi-
J tor stated that the only way by which
! funds could be obtained for the repairing
of the Sixth street sewer system would
be to increase the Street Department fund
the necessary |10,000. Deasy, upon whom
sewer troubles in the Sixth street section
have rested heavily, moved to reconsider
the tax levy in order to increase the fund
] that amount. Algeltinger moved as un
I amendment that the levy be reconsidered
I only in so far as the Street Department
was concerned. Mayor Phelan said that
the reconsideration of one subdivision of
the levy would lead to the reconsideration
of the whole, and Holland upon that
moved to reconsider the whole thing at
once and have done with it. Although
rrault fought the proceeding, the mo
tion carried, and he was obliged to change
his vote and give notice that on the next
meeting he would move to reconsider the
vote whereby the vote which passed the
tax levy was reconsidered.
Perrault submitted a minority report of
the Finance Committee against paving
the July gas bills, as they exceeded* the
provisions of the one-twelfth act. His
report was adopted and the numerous
gas questions were introduced. The
specifications were read and so amended
that sixty-six lights were done away
with at an annual saving of $21,974, and
that street lights will be turned off two
days before and two days after full
moon. Mayor Phelan also proposed an
amendment which provided that the con
tracting gas company shall at all times
submit to any inspection of meters
which the Board of Supervisors may
specify, providing that it Be, without ex
pense to the company except In cases
where meters may be found fast or other
wise defective and ordered disconnected.
That clause which called for bids for
lighting the entire city and county was
stricken out, as it was considered it
would shut out competition, there being
only one company capable of uiuuing on
the entire contract.
The passage of the demands for the gas
company's July bills then came up, and
Perraul.t claimed that the adoption or
his minority report finally disposed of the
bills at their present figure. Mr.
Crockett stepped in at this point and said
his board of directors had met earlier in
the day and Instructed him to notify the
Supervisors that unless the bills were
ordered paid on the spot the gas would
be shut off on Wednesday. Perrault
pointed out that the bills could not be
paid, the one-twelfth, act considered.
Mayor Phelan suggested that by concur
rent action of the board, the Auditor and
the Treasurer the law could be suspended
and the money appropriated.
"That may be.' replied Perrault, "but
the suspension of the one-twelfth act
would establish a dangerous precedent."
A motion was finally made to lay the
matter over for a week and it was so
ordered. The Finance Committee will
again consider and devise some mean*
for payment. ... - . , .'. ':â  â 
Leave of absence from the State for
sixty days was granted License Collector
Lees and Police Commissioner Tobln.
Gas Inspector Tupper reported that he
had discontinued ; the following : lights at
m City Ball, effecting a saving of Jill 70
per month: Sub-basement, 17; basement
corridor. 3; first floor, 6: second floor, o;
Public: Library, 26. The report also
pointed out that a further saving or
|14) 50 could bo effected by using 109
Welsbach . lights in the branch library,
engine room and City Prison. ' â 
The invitation extended" to the board
by the Xaative Sons and Daughters to
participate in the big night parade to
occur. the night after the arrival or the
California volunteers was accepted.
PETITIONS RECEIVED.
The following petitions were received and re
ferred to the proper committees:
Property owners for the repeal of resolution i
granting the Union Paving: and Contracting

OPPOSED TO GIVING
LIQUORS TO SOLDIERS
It having come to the attention of the
Baptist ministers that intoxicating: liquors
I were to be furnished the California boys
i on their arrival in this city, the following j
resolutions were unanimously adopted at
their weekly meeting yesterday:
The Baptist Ministerial Union of Pan Fran
cisco and vicinity puts on record Its emphatic
protest against the proposed furnishing of beer
and other intoxicating liquors to the returning
California volunteers at the breakfast to be
given at the fern' on their arrival.
We urge the committee having the break
fa.Â«t in charge to decline to serve anything that
might overcome the manhood of those who
have po bravely represented us on the field of
battle. C. H. HOBART.
JOHX DOWNIE.
W. G. TROWER,
Committee.
Rev. Dr. A. X. Carson. D.D., pastor of
Trinity Presbyterian Church, read a pa
per on "Christian Science Unchristian and
Unscientific" at the weekly meeting of the
Presbyterian Ministerial Union yesterday .
morning. The paper was an Interesting j
discussion of the subject. Dr. Carson ad- I
mitted the reality of many of the won- '
derful cures reported in different ages and
countries through various occult agencies,
but held that such cures are always due
to the operation of the mind upon the |
body, in accordance with physical laws. |
He said: "For mind cure pure and simple i
we can at least have respect, for it pro
ceeds, as far as it goes, along well-ascer
tained proved lines of the human |
mind, faith cure, which Is eimply ,< j
religious form of the mind cure. I have'
both respect and reverence, for it cornea
to us In the name of the real historic |
Christ, and emphasizes His work and His j
word as the ground of its action, and ;
pleads His promise of answer to prayer
When it is true prayer. But this thing.
this so-called 'truth cure" I am persuaded
Is of the devil and devilish in Its results."

GIRL KILLED BY A
DOSE OF CREOSOTE
GRASS VALLEY. Aug. 21.â This even
ing Evelyn Noble, a pretty little girl 14 |
years of age, died in agony at the homo of
her parents from swallowing the contents
of a bottle containing creosote. The only
witness to the act was her mother, who
when seen this evening said that her
daughter was suffering from toothache
during the afternoon and put some cotton
in her tooth, then turned the bottle upon
her mouth until emptied. She then gave a
prream. threw the vial across the room \
i :id said. "My God. what shall I do?"
A neighbor hurried for a phyplcian,
while the mother gave the usual simple
antidotes, but the girl died shortly after
the doctor arrived without regaining con
sciousness. Evelyn was of a loving and
cheerful disposition, and there seems to
be no reason for the girl to intentionally j
take her own life, unless crazed by pain.
The parents are heartbroken over the sad
affair.
Still More Counterfeiting.
The Secret Service has just unearthed another
band of counterfeiters and secured a large
quantity of bogus bills, which are so cleverly
executed that the average person would never
suspect tliÂ»m of being spurious. Things of
treat value are always selected for Imitation,
notably Hostetter"B Stomach Bitters, which has
many Imitators but no equals for disorders like
Indigestion, dyspepsia, constipation, nervous
ness and general debility. Always go to reliable
druggists who have the reputation of giving
what you ask for. â¢

NO DANCER OF
A REVOLUTION
IN GAY PARIS
Dreyfus' Adherents
Not of That Class.
CONVICTION SEEMS LIKELY
FRENCH ARMY OFFICERS WILL
UPHOLD THEIR FELLOWS.
Raphael Weill Speaks of Matters in
the Capital of France and Tells
How Exposition Affairs
Are Progressing.
Ex-Oongrofsmnn Thomas Clunie and
Raphael Weill, clubman and boa vivant,
returned to the city yesterday from an
extended visit to Paris. They had an ex
cellent time, particularly Mr. Clunle. to
whom life in the gay French capita; was
something of a novelty, as he was :,
the manner born as was his jolly travei
ing companion.
When spoken to yesterday In regard to
the famous Dreyfus trial Mr. Weill said:
"The matter can be no longer r< gavded as
a trial. It has assumed the proportions
of a cause. And. let me tell you, the in
terest It is exciting throughout the entire
world is hnrdly lees than that which is
manifested in F*ariH itself. It Is in Paris
and a few of the larger cities that all the
greatest feeling is manifested, and in
thi=f> places it has reached a boiling
point. In the country districts it is
not so apparent. While every Frenchman,
whether he be peasant or peer, tiller of
the soil or broker in merchandise, is, of
course, deeply concerned In ti;^ outcome
of the most sensational case that France
has experienced for years, yet it is in the
big towns that the partisan feeling runs
highest.
"While, in my opinion, Dreyfus is inno
cent beyond the shadow of a doubt, yet 1
think it highly improbable that he will
be acquitted. There is a great deal of
esprit de corps in the French army, and it
is more than likely that the officers now
trying the unfortunate man will not place
the stigma on their fellow officers which
would most certainly rest there were they
to undo what the former tribunal has al
ready done.
"Of course they may attempt to ease
the matter down by finding some mitigat
ing circumstances' which will rail for a
far lighter sentence than the first one.
But still I think that the judgment as a
whole will be much the same as the for
mer one. , .
"Should this be the case it will result in
no revolution. A popular demonstration
of disapproval may ensue, and it may be
attended with some violence and blood
shed- but it will be nothing whi<-h the au
thorities cannot easily handle and Dut
down before any great harm is done. Th?
imperialists, royalists and others who are
continually making disturbances and at
tempting to overthrow the existing order
of things are not of the party who will
take to heart and be affected by the con
viction of Dreyfus. Moreover, the pres
ent French Cabinet has been chosen from
the representative men of all parties, and
as a consequence is very popular and one
which it would be far from easy to upset.
"Preparations for the great Paris ex
position are going merrily on. The expo
sition will not be as large in area as the
one held in Chicago, but it will far sur
pass that magnificent show in the splen
dor of its exhibits. One feature which
will be new and interesting will be the
architecture of the buildings. In Chicago
the buildings, while handsome in the ex
treme were merely representations of
what has been. In Paris the endeavor
will be to represent as far as possible in
the construction of not only the buildings
hut in' everything else as well, what is to
rome. This idea will be followed out as
far a> practicable in the material em
ployed as well as in the style uf the de
signs." _
THEY TESTIFIED IN
RULOFSON'S FAVOR
WITNESSES WHO KNEW THAT
HE WAS ADOPTED.
Captain George E. Korts and W. B.
Isaacs Appear in the Fight for
Captain Winslow G. Hall's
Estate.
The hearing of the suit brought by A.
C. Rulofson against the estate of Captain
Winslow G. Hall to recover the property
left by the old sea captain as his adopted
son was resumed yesterday morning be
fore Superior Jud.ee Belcher.
The testimony of Captain George E.
Korts. an old friend of Captain Hall, was
to the effect thiit he knew of the adop
tion of the plaintiff by the old captain
and had often heard Hall speak of it. The
witness when cross examined by Attor
ney Van Ness could not be made to
change his et'>ry in any particular. The
next witness was W. B. Isaacs, who tes
tified that at the time of the alleged
adoption he was employed by the Rus
sell-Irwin Manufacturing Company, of
which firm young Rulofson was also an
employe. That one day an elderly gentle
man came into the store and spoke to
j W Stow, president of the company and
stepfather of young Rulofson. During
the conversation, part of which witness
heard the name of Ruiorson was men
tioned and when the conversation was
over and the gentleman had departed.
witness asked Mr. Stow who he was and
Mr. Stow replied that it was Rulof son's
father.
Witness remembered the circumstance
on account of its singularity, for while he
had been told that the man was Rulof
son's father he knew It was not Rulof-
When afked if Mr. Stow had told him
that it was Captain Hall, witness replied.
â â¢Ho did not." Witness also testified that
he knew Rulofson by sight.
The case was continued until to-day.

â v f -.-â -â  â  â 
Judging from the present attitude of the
farmers throughout the State the day of
hay rope has passed and wire v. ill be the
material used for binding hay in stacks.
The reason of it is the sudden increase in
the price of rope which, combined with
the minimum selling price of hay, has re
duced the profits of the farmer to the
lowest possible figure./
The only manufacturer of hay hope in
; this vicinity Is the Tubbs Cordage Com
pany. The price on hay rope has sud
denly jumped to 13c a pound on lots of
less than 10.000 pounds. Labor in the
country has increased in value and the
marketable price of hay has decreased
very nearly one-half on the figures or
last" year. "The combination of all these
I conditions works many hardships on the
farmers who raise and sell hay for a
livelihood. To augment their ills the sud
den jump in the price of rope comes as
the last straw which they will not pack.
In the East, wire is the material al
j most exclusively used in the binding of
[ hay. The cost of hay rope for a ton of
hay is approximately figured at 65 cents,
and for wire 45! â¢ cents, making a saving
of 20 cents on every ton. This results in.
a saving of at least one-third in the bal
ing.
For a long time the farmers in this
State have been undetermined whether
or not they should attempt the innova
tion and follow Eastern agriculturists
in their methods of baling. The grain
merchants in this city are advising the
producers to use the cheaper article ana
it is very likely that wire will find its
: way into all the hay farms of California
i in the very near future.
Joseph Magner of Scott & Magner,
i grain merchants at 615 Sixth street, said
yesterday: .â 'â â â 
"This sudden rise in the price of hay
! rope will work great financial injury upon
i the farmers all over the State and will
! drive them to the use of wire. With
i freight rates at the same figure, increased
charges for farm labor and the bedrock
j selling price of hay, I do not see what the
producer can do."
Frank Somers of th* firm of Burners &
Co. has lately returned to this coast
' from the East, where he has made a
study of hay baling. .â  /. â¢
"Wire is used in the East." he said yes
! terday, "and it is more <*atisfaclory a;.d
1 cheaper than any other material, I sh*il
| advise the farmers to <se it here for
their own material benefit."

this board, in view of th-e patriotic services rendered
by the First California Volunteer Regiment, to declare the day
the troops land in this city and county on their return from Ma
nila to be a legal Jwliday; and
Whereas, Xo information as to the intention of the Gov

therefore, be it
Resolved, That his Honor, the Mayor, be and he is hereby
empowered to authorize the closing of all the public offices, as far

nicipality to participate with their fellow citizens in the welcome
to be accorded the volunteers in appreciation of their patriotic
services.
GOVERNOR GAGE is still the dog

jutant general he drove in a hark from
the Palace Hotel to the office of the Har
bor Commissioners, where he met Major
Harney and Rudolph Herold. .He de
manded from them for his personal use
In the buy parade the State tug Gover
nor Markham. They explained to him
that the tug had been turned over to
Commodore Spreckela for use In the
naval parade. Gage stuck to his demand
and left, with the understanding that the
Commissioners would see to it.
Messrs. Harney and Herold called upon
Commodore Spreckels and wajited to
know if it could not be arranged so that
he could release the Markham. saying
the Governor insisted on It, even though
he might not want to go in the parade.
Commodore Spreckels replied that the
Markham had been given him officially by
the Commissioners; that he had devoted a
â  deal of time, had worked day and
night arranging the programme for the
parade, and did not propose, ai this time,
that It should be interfered with. He
said he would not release the Markham
unless the Harbor Commissioners would
secure for him a vessel of equal capacity
with the Markham to tow the yacht Ag"
i::'\ which the Governor had refused to
tow provided he went In the parade.
The Commissioners then called upon
Captain Henry Glass, the commandant at
Goat [Bland, and he said he could arrange
it so the committee would have the tug
Vigilant, which is a better boal than the
Markham. < m these conditions Commo
dore Spreckela released the Markham.
The Vigilant will take the place of the
Markham In the naval parade and will
tow the .Aggie. The Markham is now out
of the parade, and if the Governor goes
on her he Will parade by himself, and
"Me First," perhaps. If the Governor
docs not decide upon this plan the tug
will be tied up.
After leaving the office of the Hnrhor
Commissioners t he gubernatorial oarcy
was next heard of through the telephone.
It was evidently in bad temper. The tÂ»itl
zens' executive committee felt it first. The
members had barely settled in sessioi
Mayor Phelan's office when the telephone
bell rang and the one answering Bald S< .>â¢
mans was at the other <-nd.
"Invite him up," came in chorus from
every member. Mayor Phelan reached
his phone, prepared to extend the invita
tion, hut his breath froze in the receiver.
The conversation, as repeated by the
Mayor, was like this:
" 'Hello, general; this is Die Mayor. The
citizens' executive committee is now In
session and would very much like you to
comeâ'
"' Sir! T have a faint recollection of say-
Ing to you yesterday thai the Governor
would tak^ part in the naval parade In
his tug, the Governor Markham. T>iiÂ«
morning his Excellent y advises mo that
he has decided not to participate in that
way.'
" 'Hut. general, how about the parade
arrangements? 1
" 'That is all, sir; good-hy.' " and bring
went the telephone on the "Me First" end
of the line.
That settled the naval part of it, but
still left the parade end open. Marshal
L. â¢ '. Plstolesi took action late in the day
to close that by issuing the following:
GENERAL ORDER NO. 3.
SAX FRANCISCO, Auc. :i. 1899

He followed this up during the after
noon with the following letter:

sports be modified if the committees making
arrangements for the reception of the volun
teers make their desires In this regard known
to me in season to permit of such modification.
I shall be at the Palace Hotel until after the
recaption is over, and will be glad to grant
any assistance possible. I am anxious to do
everything in my power to contribute to the
proper celebration of the great event. You
are well aware, however, that 1 have, as the
Chief Executive of the State, certain Stat
duties to discharge in the premises, which will
be performed. I am Fatlsfled that by proper
conference with the gentlemen in authority
all plans may be made harmonious. You will.
as adjutant-general, carry out these purposes
as directed by me, and communicate my In
structions to Major General John H. Dickin
son, N. G. C. Respectfully.
' HENRY T. GAGE.
Grand Marshal Pistolesi has not heard
from the Governor and does not know
whether the executive Is afoot or ahorse
back. General Seamans got a quick move
on. however, and communicated the order
Indicated in Gape's letter to Major Gen
eral Dickinson, who immediately did what
he was expected to do order the National
Guard out to do honor to the returning
volunteers. In transmitting this infor
mation General Seamana was more fortu
nate than he seems to have been in con
veying the offer of General Shatter to
furnish mounts for the Governor and his
staff. At least the Governor says so.
You can believe either you choose. In a
letter to Marshal Pistoles!, under date
of August IS, the Governor wrote:
L'nder a separate cover I have received a
communication dated August 15, 1899. from you,
as grand marshal, wherein you express on be
half of the parade committee a request that
I should participate with my staff mounted in
the procession. It will be impossible to com
ply with your request in this particular, as
the adjutant-general informs me that he can
not procure suitable mounts for the staff.
The general uncertainty as to the "at
ness" of the Governor was shared last
night by the San Francisco legislative
delegation. It met last night at the office
Of Assemblyman Cobb In the I'arrott
tmilding to discuss the proposition of go
inK to sea on the Santa Rosa to meet the
returning troops, but found after a very
little talk that they were already there.
figuratively speakinj;. Governor Gage is
responsible. He haÂ« accepted and rejected
and reaccepted and declined so many in
vitations to accompany the legislators
that they do not exactly know where they
are "at."' They spent several hours last
night trying to locate themselves, and
wound up by appointing a committee to
call on the Governor and find out If his
last communication to them wan a decli
nation or an acceptance of their invita
tion and attempt to exact a promise from
him not to change his plans during the
Assemblyman Cobb called the meeting
to order and H. Porter Ashe acted as Bec
retary. Senator M. w. Miller of thr recep
tion committee reported that he had tele
graphed the following invitation to the
Statr officers and members of the Legis
"You are respectfully Invited to become
the guest of the San Francisco delegation
of the State legislature and participate
In extending a welcome to our returning
soldiers. Answer. Headquarters, Lick
i louse."
.Acceptances had been received from the
Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
Controller, Treasurer and many legisla
tors.
Mr. Miller stated that the Governor had
told him that he had made other arrange
ments and could not join the lawmakers
on the Santa Rosa.
"He is coming with us, all right."' said
a member. "I saw him to-day and he
said that he had chanced his plans and
would be with us."
Some one wanted to know who else had
been invited, and Mr. Miller replied that
among others were the members of the
citizens' executive committee. This did I
not please Assemblyman E. D. Sullivan.
He claimed that the committee had of
fered an insult to the executive and that
as Mr. Gage accepted their invitation to
accompany them on the Santa Rosa It ]
would be small courtesy to him to bring i
along the men who had not shown him
the proper respect. Another member
mggested that It was by no means certain
that the Governor was going with them,
and Mr. Miller reaffirmed that he had de
clined the invitation.
Sig Bettman suggested that if they could

I^^ you do so, you will know exactly when the transport Sher
man has reached the homestretch and is about to enter the harbor.
Immediately after the ship is sighted by the Merchants' Exchange
The Call will send up from the dome of its building a box kite, the
same as used by the United States Weather Sureau. Attached to
this kite will be a sixteen-foot flag, which will be sent to a point
300 feet above the dome, thus making it 615 feet from the ground.
This will be of sufficient height to be seen not only by the resi
dents of San Francisco, but also by those of the neighboring towns.
Every one will thus have the promptest kind of notification, and
can make his or her preparations accordingly for participating in
the welcome to "the boys." Be sure to keep your eye on the dome.

and Major General Dickinson visited the
rooms yesterday, and the former, claim

executive's plan, as presented by General
Seamans. the troops will be met at the
Folsom street wharf at 7 O'clock in the
morning. The Governor will extend the
Gage glad hand and then take a hack
and drive to the Palace Hotel, where he
request* that the le>rislators meet him

LIGHTS GLEAM ON
DOME AND TOWERS
The citizens' decoration committee had
an opportunity last night to judge of the
effect of the electrical display which they
have provided on the City Hall dome and
ferry depot tower. The current was turned
on at the City Hall aboutÃ:3oo'clock. large
crowds being gathered on the surrounding
streets. The burning out of a fuse de
layed the illumination, but in a short time
it whs replaced and the lights were found
to work beautifully, although they were
not turned on for any length of time, as
the committee was even then due at the
ferry building.
Total to date, 852,766 90.
When the lights were turned on at the
f>'ir\ , shortly before ]0 o'clock, the effect,
in a double sense, was electrical. The
crowds that had gathered on East street
let up one grea-t yell, which was repeated
and carried uptown, causing everybody
on Market' street to turn to he rewarded
by a sight of the most beautiful night
spectacle ever produced in the city.
And that's only one end of it. No won
der the decoration committee works, and
small wonder it should be proud of its
efforts.
Everybody has seen Herrmann and other
prestidigitators produce ihree kinds of
wine from the same bottle, but it has re
mained for the citizens' decoration com
mittee to make palm leaves, Christmas
trees and graceful dracaenas sprout from
one and the same telephone pole, or lamp- j
post, as the 'case might be. They have !
done it, however, and nothing like' it has I
ever been seen before in any other city i
and, despite the oddity of this sudden I
burgeoning, no prettier effect, to judge
even now at the uncompleted stage, could
be imagined.
The work of putting in place the world
of palm. Christmas tree branches and I
dracaena, willingly donated by the entire
State for the beautlrication or San Fran
cisco, was begun yesterday morning,
when 1:55 Colorado volunteers came in
from the Presidio to put themselves un
der the orders of the decoration commit
tee. They were divided up into squads,
provided with new hatchets and nails,
and, under the direction of the florists of
the city, who had also volunteered their
services, started to transform Market
street into a tropical vista.
How well they succeeded was seen last
night by the thousands and thousands of
people who crowded that thoroughfare to
note the march of preparation. Along the
south side, from the ferry to Tenth
street, not a lamppost or a telephone pole
that had not been converted into a very
fair representation of a tree. On the
north side, from East street to Ellis, a
similar beautiful effect had been secured.
The work will be completed to-day. The
beauty of this leafy decoration is en
hanced by wreaths and bunting and flags
on the buildings on each side, to place
which the owners . have gone to much
trouble and expense.
The decoration of the ferry building,
inside and out, is progressing rapidly,
and to-morrow will see the water front
in holiday attire. The citizens' executive
committee have allowed the Harbor Com
missioners an additional $500 for the dis
play, and Chief Wharfinger Henderson,
who has that feature in charge, has al

GENERAL SHAFTER
OUTLINES HIS PLANS
Major General Shafter. commanding the
Department of alifornla. sent yesterday
to the citizens' executive committee an
outline of his plan for the day parade to
follow the disembarkation of the Califor
nia volunteers. He invited suggestions.
Captain A. C. Ducat, General Shafter's
chief aid, acted as his spokesman.
Under this plan General Shafter and
staff will head the line, followed by a
detachment of artillerymen and such reg
ular troops as may be designated. Next
will follow Mayor Phelan and members
of the citizens' executive committee, the
returned Ca.mornia volunteers, with the
Colorado Volunteer Regiment, acting as
escort. The National Guard will follow,
headed by Governor Gage and his staff,
provided the executive desires to partici
pate. Other unattached military organi
zations will bring up the rear.
The parade will start from the ferry
depol at 10 o'clock and march nut Market
Street to Van Ness avenue, to be reviewed
at Van Ness avenue and Bush street.
General Shafter promises to get the
troops off the transport early in the morn
ing, so that they will have ample time to
enjoy the breakfast at the ferry before
the "march to the Presidio.
A few suggestions were made by the
committee, which will be embodied In the
general's orders which will be issued to
day.

Fatal Accident Averted.
A laundry wagnn in which P. Hond"
ville and N\ Fauret wore riding collided
with a dray on Folsom street, near Sev
enth, last night, and the horse attached to
the laundry rip ran away. Two girls
were crossing the street, and to save. them
from being run over Fauret jumped upon
the shafts and grabbed the reins, which,
had been dropped by Hondeville. He suc
ceeded in stopping the runaway, but both
he and Hondeville were thrown to the
ground. They were taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Fiuiret was found to
have received several scalp wounds, while
Hondeville was badly bruised about tha
body.
