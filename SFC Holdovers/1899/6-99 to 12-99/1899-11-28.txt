TRUE STORY OF THE GRAS PAN
FIGHT HAS NOT YET BEEN TOLD
In Addition to the Terrible
Losses Inflicted on the Naval
Contingent There Is a Fear
That the Ninth Lancers
Were Captured by the Boers.
LONDON. Nov. 28.â The general movement
on Colenso is the first stage of the ad
vance for the relief of Ladysmith. The
latest dispatches state that the advanc
ing force number 10,000 men. How
10,000 men reached Estcourt there is no
information at hand. Only two days ago
Hildyard's force was not thought to ex
ed 4000 men, while Clery's division
was supposed to be scattered along the
line from Durban to Estcourt, waiting
for artillery and cavalry before concen
ig. Evidently the censor has been
alert and all the news of the gathering
Clery's nine thousand men has been
cut out of the press dispatches.
L. a. m.
â A fresh interruption in the j
East African cable sen-ice at this j
interesting moment has caused a
cessation of war news. As yet the :
War Office has not received Lord
Methuen's list of casualties, nor is
any information at hand regard
ing the whereabouts of the Ninth
Lancers, who went in pursuit of
the Boers from Gras Pan.
The Daily Mail says that a pri
vate telegram announces that the
Lancers are still scouting ahead
jjf^lethuen's advancing column,
bu: as he announced yesterday
that he was giving his men a day s
rest this is hardly possible.
Indeed, the greatest anxiety is
felt, and more especially in view
of the fact that a Berlin journal,
the Deutschwarte, which regu
larly prints Boer communica
tions, announced yesterday, be
lore it could have been ascer
tamed from British sources, that
... . , ......â¢-..
the naval brigade lost 100 men
at Gras Pan and that the Ninth
Lancers were captured.
It is understood that thcGov
emment has decided to proceed
immediately with the mobiliza
tion and embarkation ot a divis
mn of 10.000 men. under a well
known lieutenant general.

General Hildvard's achieve

ment at Beacon Hill is beginning
to be realized as one 01 the best
things the campaign has vet
fhown. as it has relieved the ten
- , .- ...Â» ,
sion ot the situation in Natal and
has brought the relief of Lady
smith within measurable distance.
General Buller appears to be
confident ot Lord Methurn s
ability and is devoting all his en
ergy to Ladysmith.
An attempt will be made, pre
suir.ablv. to reach Colenso in time
FERRY OVER THE TUGELA RIVER, NEAR COLENSO.
In view of the advance of the British columns for tIM relief of Ladysmith and the destruction by the Boers of the railroad and wagon-road bridges- at CW
tcfiar th!s ferry route becomes of much strategic importance and will of course be stoutly guarded by the Boers.
The San Francisco Call
to cut oft the retreat oi the Boers
from Weenan over the Tuc:ela
River. It is feared, however, that
the enemy will get there first and
destroy the bridge. At Freer
Bridge the British found two
massive spans utterly wrecked by
dynamite, one piece weighing
224 pounds having been hurled
200 yards.
Sir Alfred Millner has warned
the various relief committees in
Cape Town to be prepared for
the arrival of 10,000 refugees
from Kimbcrjey^as^QQii^as^Lhe
siege has been raised.
According to a dispatch from
De Aar. dated Sunday, the Boers
had destroyed the bridge at
Steinsburg the previous day and
were being reinforced at that
point.

Lord Methuen continues his prepress

papers that he had had a third engage

Such a movement would occupy about
ten days for any considerable force, and
about seven or eight days for a forre. of

MYSTERIOUS STABBING
OF A MARINE FIREMAN
William McDonald Assaulted and
Thrown Into the Bay.
Frightful Cutting Affray in Broad Daylight
That the Authorities Have Been
Unable to Understand.
WILLIAM McDON'ALD. a marine
engineer, was found yesterday
forenoon, about 11 o'clock,
roaming about the lumber piles
at Sixth and Berry streets with
a frightful cut in his throat that had sev
ered his windpipe, while there were sev
eral knife wounds over his heart and one
In the region of the abdomen. The man
was very much dazed and could not
give an intelligent explanation of his con
dition. The police were unable to un
ravel the mystery that surrounds the
case. McDonald was able to speak a few
words, and from what he said the detec
tives learned that he claimed to have
been attacked by three marine firemen.
who after stabbing him threw him Into
the Channel-street slough. Investigation
failed to corroborate his stories and he
finally admitted that he had not told the
truth, but he refused to divulge the name
of his assailants.
McDonald arrived here from Alaska a
few days a*o on the steam schooner
Aloha. Since he reached the city he has
been drinking: heavily and for several
days has been hanging about the saloons
In the vicinity of Sixth and Berry streets, j
He did not visit his usual haunts yester
day morning, but about 11 o'clock Special
Otticer Ryan of the Fire Alarm and Police
Telegrapn Department was attracted by
a man covered with blood wandering aim
lessly among the lumber piles. The gory
Individual proved to be McDonald. The j
blood was spurting from the fearful gash i
In hi.- throat and nls shirt was saturated j
with the red fluid from the wounds In his I
breast.
The mar was weak from loss of blood
and fainted Just as the special officer
rushed to his assistance. He was hurried ;
to the Receiving Hospital, where It w:is
found that his windpipe had been severed
and that there were two deep cuts over
the heart and one In the left side of the
abdomen. Aft<?r the man rallied he stated 1
that he had been attacked on the steamrr
Noyo by Fireman Charles Smith, who
after stabbing him had thrown him Into I
I the muddy waters of the slough. The de- I
; tectlve worked on this theory, hut found !
| that McDonald had not been on board of ;
the vessel and that Fireman Smith had j
not left the boat during the day. and tie- |
nied all knowledge of the affair.
Later the Injured man admitted that his
first story was not true. He said that he ,
had been attacked while on his way to ;
the N'iyo by a fireman named Pheian |
Callaghan. This latter Individual the p.- I
I lice have boon unable to locate. He is |
not known at the headquarters of the Ma- i
rine Firemen's Union, and his narr. does;
not appear in the city directory. The de- |
I teeth are inclined to believe that he- Is ;
I a myth; but McDonald Insists that he ex- 1
. ists and that he Is the man who assaulted
him.
While under the Influence of the anes
thetics that had been given him McDon
ald told â  rambling story about a flremin
' named Porter assisting in the alleged at
tempt to murder him. Porter lives at 113
Br.inn.in street, and denies that he knows
McDonald or had anything to do with the
stabbing.
As the Investigation into the man's
) statements progressed the more dense be
came the mystery that surrounds thÂ«Â« cut
ting, and the authorities admit their In
ability to unravel it until McDonald's
j wounds heal sufficiently to enable him to
! talk and tell all of the details. It ts cvi
, dent that he is concealing something, and
I at! of the circumstances seem to point to
! the, conclusion that he was cut by some
i one whom he Is not Inclined to have pun
i ished. What the motive may be for Oie
desperate attempt to take the man's life
Is one of the things that adds much to the
mystery.
When McDonald was found he was
I drenched, bearing out the statement that
Ihe had been thrown Into the water. But
it was observed that he was not covered
t with the ooze of the Channel-street
i slough, and the mud that covered his
clothes was rot of the kind that abounds
: In the vicinity of Sixth and Berry streets
Yet It was fresh mud. and the detectives
are puzzled to know where It came from.
It ha* been definitely proven that rob
bery was not the motive for the crime, for
when McDonald's clothes were searched
at the Receiving Hospital a considerable
amount of cash waÂ« found In his pockets.
A sister-in-law of the wounded man re
sides at 122 Second street. She Is the

only known relative that he has In thl*
part of the country- She Is at a loss to
account for the affair. According to her
statements he had no enemies and did
not become quarrelsome when he was In
liquor. The Idea that his wounds were
self-inflicted Is scouted by his Â»lster-ln
law. who says that he had no reason for
taking his own life and was not of a de
spondent nature.
i,ate last nignt tne wnumiea man was
taken to the I'nlted States Marine Hos
pital. His condition was such that the at
tending physirians Trould not allow him to
be interviewed. They state that his condi
tion Is serious, but that the chance* for
his recovery are good. He Is breathing
through a silver tub*, which has been In
serted Into the severed ends of his wind
pipe.
The steamer N'oyo left yesterday after
noon for the north. It Is thought that thÂ«i
mysterious Phelan CaMachan may possi
bly be one of the passengers.

GOLD DEMOCRATS TO
STAND BY M'KINLEY
Will Vote the Republican Ticket
Should Bryan Be Named by the
Silver Wing.
NEW YORK. Nov. 27.â The Press has
tho following from Washington: The
promised legislation for the gold stand
ard is pleasing to the Democrats who
voted for McKinley and against Bryan in
the Presidential campaign. General Pal
mer, the geld Democratic leader, ca'led
on tho President to-day and paid his re
spects. The venerable ex-Senntnr nays
thr.t tl?o nomination of Bryan is inevita
ble, ai.d that with his name at the head
of the Democratic ticket for the Presi
dency the gold Democrats will not vote
for him. "Bryan" means "silver," and
nothing else, no matter what the plat
form may declare, and General Palmer
predicts Bryan's defeat. Nothing that
can come up, he says, can obscure the
real issue of the campaign, with Bryan
as the Democratic candidate. The Presi
dent cannot bo blinded to the real issue,
which is the free coinage of silver at 10
to 1.
Josiah Patterson of Tennessee, who was
ilefeated for Congres by the Free Silver
Democrats, has ouillnÂ«xl v scht-me to the
President for the next campaign. It is
that there shall be no ticket put into the
field by the Gold Democrats, but that an
â¢x<"cutlve committee shall be apj>ointed to
look after Congressional candidates,
where they can divide the Democratic
vote. In the next Presidential election.

WARSHIPS ARE
COALED AT SEA
Successful Test of a
New Invention.
OF MUCH VALUE TO THE NAVY
TRIAL BOARD AFTER EXPERI-
MENTB IS SATISFIED.
Report to the Naval Department Is
Favorable to the Adoption
of the Miller Con
veyor.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 27.â As a result of
three days' trial of "coaling ship" while
towing at sea, just completed by the Unit
ed States battleship Massachusetts and
the collier Marctllus, It may soon be pos
sible for any warship to receive coal by
the overhead wire system at the average
rate of twenty tons an hour. The vessels
named returned to port to-night and an
chored oft Tompkinsville, S. 1., after hav
ing been away for a week, three days of
which were spent at sea. giving the Miller
conveyor â  thorough trial under varied
conditions.
At the conclusion of to-day's trial, the
third of the seriesâ when 126 bags of coal,
each weighing 410 pounds, had been trans
ported in â¢* minutes without an accident,
bb of them being delivered in 44 minutesâ
tho trial board announced that the test
was t-nded and that they were satistled
with the result.
The trial board assigned by the Navy
Department to witness and report on tho
experiments from the deck of the collier
Marccllus was composed of Commander
A. B. -M. Llllie. in command of the Mar
callus; Lieutenant Commander W. D.
Rose, and Lieutenant John B. Bernardo.
The battleship and collier left the city
last Tuesday. They made anchor in San
dy Hook Bay on Wednesday night, pro
ceeding to sea at S o'clock the next morn-
Ing. A pair of wooden shears about thirty
feet high had oeen erected on the after
deek ot the Massachusetts. At the top of
these was fastened a largo iron block,
over the sheave of which the wire cable
traveled that was to bring the bags of
coal across to the warship. At the cast
end of the entrance to Gerney's Channel
and about four miles from Sandy Hook
lightship a boat was lowered from the
battleship and a towing hawser quickly
run to the collier. By means of a smaller
line a sea anchor cable was sent over to
the Massachusetts and made fast, its end
having llrst been passed through the top
of the carrierâ a Bat Iron block having
three sheaves, one above the other,
through which the conveying cables run.
This lirst cable passed through sheaves ut
the foremast and mainmast heads of the
collier, the wire then loading to the water,
where a cone-shaped canvas bag towing
astern kept the line taut and helped to
support the carrier and its load.
A specially contrived Imrwood engine
having two winding drums is located close
to and Ã¼baft the foremnst on the collier.
A steel \-inch cable leads from one down
to the foremast -head, over a sheave,
across to the Hock on the warship's
sh<.;irs, thence back to the collier's mast,
and dewn to the rear drum. This thing
gives a reciprocating motion to the con
voying rope, paying out one part under
tension.
The bags of coal are first hoisted from
the â :-â :â¢â  to the masthead upon an
Iron cuge or elevator. The letter C in
verted represents the iron bale with the
hooks at its end. to which the bags are
suspended, on two short rods that project
from the top of the elevator. The carrier li
ntuil with a long pointed hook pivoted at
its bottom. This hook driven under the iron
bale engages it. the elevator drops and the
carrier Harts at a speed of 1200 feet a min
ute for the warship. When it reaches that
end of the route a rubber buffer on the
block strikes n latch, which releases the
hook and the ha*,'.", with their Iron bale,
drop down the canvas chute to the decks
if the warship. w..ere the jackies scam
per away with It on trucks to the bunkers.
Three hundred feet :Â« the distance main
tained between ships during the operation.
The tost was a success from the start.

veyor, was alÂ« ard the Massachusetts.

THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
PINCHING UTAH FARMERS
AN INCREASE OF GRAIN RATES
THAT MEANS RUIN.
When the Southern Pacific Company
can find no excuse to pinch the local mer
chant.-) it la not adverse to going a little
distance atiHd in pursuit 01 its favorite
mode "f "raising the wind."
The i es to suffer from Its grasp-
Ing policy are the farmers of Utah, who
have lately been placed In a position
which foroea them to either find another
market for their crops or go to the wall.
The rate on wheat shipments out of
Utah baa heretofore been M a ton. This
has lately beon raised to 17.60, a figure
high enough to create a prohibitive
tariff and do away with the shipment of
grain. It is now impossible for the farm
era of that Btate to get their crops to
market at â  profit. The rate will not only
eat up all their profits, but will put them
so fur on the other side of the ledger
that it will take another good season to
allow them to get anywhere near even
should the rates be restored to their old
mark.
As most of the Utah wheat finds a
market on this Coast, In this city, tho
Southern Pacific has a monopoly of tho
proposition unless one of the competing
roads cuts in and diverts the Utah trade
to other points.
This will in all probability be done.
Steps are now being taken by the Texas
road, in conjunction with the Rio Grande,
to make a tariff that will enable the
Utah farmers to market their goods with
some profit in different points In Texas,
and the Oregon Short Line will, most
likely, put before them a proposition that
will give them a chance to reach Oregon
and the Puget Sound points.

t
Peter Silvas, Arrested for Disturb
ing the Peace, Roughly Treated
by Officer Bell.
Â»
Peter Silvas, a Mexican, died at St.
Mary's Hospital yesterday afternoon un
der circumstances which will bear invest
igation.
On lan Thursday afternoon Police Of
ficer D. J. Bell responded to a whistle
call from 1113 V* Kearny street, where Sil
vaa resided, and was told by the landlord
of the house that Silvas was drunk and
disorderly and an officer was needed to
quiet him.
According to witnesses, Officer Bell went
to the room where Sllvas vrai lying, and
after a few moments brought the uul'Ttu
nate man from the house to the street
handcuffed und bleeding profusely from
many scalp wounds. While helpless from
the beating he had received and unable
on account of th.- handcuffs on hl6 wrists
to do any damage, Sllvas, who weighed
about 180 poundn. was roughly dragged
to the street by the officer, who. In tho
presence of a large crowd which had con
gregated in front of the house, beat the
helpless man on the head with his cluo
and drugged him to the corner, where the
patrol wagon was waiting to take the
victim to the California street station.
The people who witnessed the brutal af
fair were lcud in their protestations of
the unwarranted conduct "of the police
officer and a woman who had watched the
entire affair blew a police whistle for an
officer to protect the unfortunate man
from further assault.
Silvas' wife, a hard-working woman
employed :i. the Mexican restaurant at
525 Broadway, was in the room when the
otllcer commenced the assault. She pleod
ed with him not to kill the man, saying
that she would put him to bed and lake
care of him, but her pleadings were un
heeded and the beating continued. Imme
diately after her husband had been taken
to jail she ran into the restaurant where
the is employed and cried out that her
husband liud been murdered. Her cm
ployor tried to pacify her and have her
return to her room, but she refused, say
ing the slcht of so much blood on the
floor and the walls was more than sue
could stand. She stated that when officer
Hell entered the .room he gave orders to
Flop her husband from making further
noise and she promised to do so. The
oilier yelled so loudly that her husband
awoke ami asked the cause of the trouble
and immediately the officer pounced on
Sllvas and commenced to beat him over
the head and arms, and though she pro
tested Hell kept up the tattoo on the
man's head until he reached the porcb of
tho house.
Mrs. bilvus, after the affair, left the
of the trouble ancl moved I â¢ .
Broadway, where her husband found
her after his release from Jail the
r.'-xt day. Ki.'tn the time he was released
he aÂ«iÂ«d strangely and r.>iu;>lained of
Lams in his head, and the woman, fearing
for his safety and on the advice of her
f: i. ads, had her husband brought to St.
M.ti> .-. Hoepita] on Sunday afternoon, lie
I late the next day.
Mi*. <;. Kamarls, who lives at 11174
Ki-arny street, gnve the following state
ment as her version of the assault: "1
live near where the trouble occun
heard Mrs. Bllvas cry to the officer to
â¢ . that she would tÃke care of her
husband, and she pleaded to the officer
not to beat the man any more.
"When the officer reached the porch
Sllvas was weak and helpless and covered
with blood, arid seemed to faint when the
officer hit him several hard blows on the
top of his head. I heard a woman blow
a police whistle and then yell for an ofn
.> ii 11 1 X that Deli would kill Sllvas if
tie old not stop him.
"The handcuff* were on Sllvas' wrists
all the time, and he was screaming with
pain. It was the most brutal thing I ever
witnessed to see that big policeman beat
the little man so unmercifully, and I
never want to witness such a sight agajn.
The crowd of onlookers expressed them
selves against such a brutal assault, and
I thought at one time they would inter
fere to save the man."
Officer Bell made the following state
ment at the California-street station last
night: "On Monday afternoon I was
called to 11134 Kearny street and was told
that Sllvas was drunk and disorderly
When I went to his room I told him to
k^ep quiet or I would arrest him. When I
started to leave the room he made a great
rush at me and tried to kick me and
throw me down. He took hold of me and
I hit him on the wrist to make him let go,
hut he continued to fight, and I n::
him. The woman tried to interfere, anl
I told her that her husband was under ar
rest. I hroufcht him to the street. I might
bare hit him on the head, but If I did It
was not hard enough to hurt him. I <1M
not hit him while on the street. I orderÂ»*>l
a charge of disturbing the peace put
against him. He was sent to the Harbor
Hospital for treatment, but I am sure I
did not hurt the man. I merely pmtected
myself from his assault, as he was fight-
Ing drunk. 1 '

for car fare from a man who resembled
the prisoner, except that the man wore i
a thin, light mustache and the prisoner !
appeared In court close-shaven.
After the bad half had been rejected
by the railroad company's receiver Rog
ers cassed It to an old man who had
handed him a good dollar. He did not In- I
tend to "utter ' the bad coin, but as It !
was In his pocket with two good half- !
dollar pieces he took It out "accidental
ly" and gave it away in change.
Conductor F. Elllnger of the same road
received a similar bad piece from a man
closely resembling the prisoner, with the
exception ex the missing mustache. The
coin was produced in court and proved
to he a very dangerous counterfeit, being
made of an alloy of tin. and having a
clear silvery ring, but being a little light.
The examination was continued â¢ until
next Saturday morning at 10 o'clock, when
the defendant will introduce testimony.

Unfounded charges Dismissed.
Miss B. M. Bretz, a teacher In the Lin
coln Evening School, was on trial last
night before the Board of Education, but
before the Inquiry was over her accusers
were very close to the danger line of In
vestigation for preferring unwarranted
charges. The lady was accused of ln
competency for having. It was alleged,
failed to maintain the numerical standard
of her classes. She Is slightly deaf, and
her infirmity was magnified by H. Mc-
Donald, the principal of the school, Into
Incapacity. The principal Is an aged man
who preferred that the board consider
him a gentleman of uncertain age rather
than tell how old he really is. His evi
dence was not material except an admis
sion that he had preferred the charges
after Miss I!retz had been transferred
from his school to the Spring Valley
School. Principal Sykes of this school
Fent a communication declaring that Miss
}<rÂ«-tÂ»! was Incompetent, and It was shown
that Principal Sykes had resented the
coming of Miss Bretz and for the three
nights that she was under his scrutiny
had to give her a claps. Ml** Bretz then
took the stand and demonstrated that she
can hear as well as any one who listened
to her. The charges against her were
unanimously dismissed, and some of the
members of the board Intimated after the
meeting that Mr. McDonald may have to
become confidential nnd tell his true age.

DOCTOR CHARGED WITH
SWINDLING A PATIENT
WALDERMiIR SCHCI.TZ THROWS*
IN PRISON.
Accused by Linda S IraltM of De
frauding Her Out of Over (600
by False Representation.
Dr. Waldermer Scholti. who has an
office on Montgomery street, was ar
yesterday by Pollea OfA â  r â¢ â 
a warrant Issued by police Jud*e I
charging him with obtaining â 
false pretenses. The complaining wltne**
Is Linda Schultae â¢â ( 1826 Polk street.
According to her story the defendant
by representing that he owned valuable
property on Van Xess avenue succeeded
In borrowing various sums of money
from her, amounting In all to Jt>7s. IIÂ«
pretended that he needed the money to
pay off a mortgage on the property.
Several days ago Mrs. Scnultze. who la
a prepossessing widow, learned that the
doctor's name did not adorn the assess
ment roll and she proceeded to make a:t
investigation.
It did not take her lons to find that
Scholtz had no Interest In the property
which he claimed he owned, and, becom
ing angry, she decided to have him ar
rested. Yesterday she appeared before
Judge Conlan and swore to a complaint
charging him with obtaining money by
false pretenses. The warrant was placed
in the hands of Officer O'Connor, who.
after considerable difficulty, succeeded in
locating the doctor, lie was at onco
taken to the California-street station.
where he was locked up in default of,
$1000 bail.
Scholtz denies that he obtained any
money from Mr Schultze under falso
pretenses. He claims that he was em
ployed as her physician and earned thf
amount which Â«he says he swindled her
out of by attending her during a recent
illness. He also declares that Mrs.
Schultze was enamored of his charms and
that she had agreed to become his wife.
This Is emphatically denied by the com
plaining witness.
NEW STATUS OF LICENSES.
Retail Liquor Dealers Under Juris-
diction of Police Commission.
City and County Attorney Lane has ad
1 dressed a communication to License Col
lector Lees In reply to a request for an
opinion as to what licenses are payable
under the new charter. Mr. Lane states
that by the terms of the charter the
Board of Supervisors Is empowered to Im
pose license taxes and to provide for tho
collection thereof, but with the Important
limitation that no license taxes shall be
Imposed upon any person who. at any
fixed place of business, sells or manufac
tures merchandise except such as require
permits from the Board of Police Commis
sioners. Such permits are required In the
cone of any person engaging In the sale
of liquor In less quantity than one quart
or engaging in the business of selling
liquor to be drunk on the premises.
7i It follows." concludes the opinion,
'"that with the exception of those persons
engaged In carrying on what Is commonly
known as a saloon business or retail
liquor business, every manufacturing es
tablishment and every wholesale and re
tall business house doing business at k
fixed place of business in this city on and
after the Sth day of January, 19w. will be
relieved of all license taxes heretofore Im
posed upon such business of manufactur
ing or selling goods, wares and merchan
dise.
"As the Board of Supervisors has full
power to Impose license taxes with the ex
ceptions above noted. It Is not Impossible
to say what license taxes will be Imposed
other than those now obtaining."
Mr. Lane is also of the opinion that no
license tax can legally be colic for the
sale of Imported goods In unbroken pack
ages, such tax having been held by Ch>f
Justice Marshall to be In violation of the
provisions of the Federal constitution.ROBERTS TO BE SEATED

Course of Procedure (o Be Foi=
lowed in Barring (he Polygaraist
From Congress.
r.WAs HEADQUARTERS. WELLING- '
ton hotel; Washington: Nov. 27.-!
Mr. Roberta of Utah probably will be i
sworn Sn a:id seated r.s v member of the
House of Representatives and will be sub- ;
frequently turned out by the adoption of a
resolution of expulsionâ a course favored '
by many conservative leaders In the
House and one Ukeiy to be adopted. By
following this plan tho House would not â 
put Itself In the position of taking snap â¢
judgment on Mr. Roberts. The resolution
of expulsion would be referred to tho Ju
diciary Commlttoo of the House-a com
tnlttee made up of tr.cn chosen for their j
legal attainmentsâ and Mr. Roberts thus
would be given an opportunity to present
his ca^e and submit arguments In support (
of his right to retain his seat. Though ;
the men who favor this course are nearly '
all convinced that the charges made
against Mr. Roberts are well founded and
the report Â«>f the committee will be in i
favor of expulsion, they think It best to
take a conservative course and make it ;
Impossible for Mr. Roberts or any one i
<lse to assert that he had b*Â«en condemned i
Without trial. No doubt when the vote is '
taken the resolution of expulsion will be j
adopted by mor<> than the necessary two
thirds of the House.
Mr. Roberts has shown that he Is capa- ;
Me of putting his own case In about the
Strongest light possible, but he will doubt-
Joss employ counsel and his Mormon sup
porters In Utah rarely will ?ee to it that ,
he does not lack able legal advice. There
will be vtrotsg lawyers arrayed against j
him. Some ><i the various societies which
are advocating bis expulsion from the
House have employed counsel. The I
League for Social Service, which Is one â 
of these Ktcietfes, has employed a com- !
blnation "f legal talent peculiarly well j
fitted to present such a case. This com
blnation Includes f"rmer Senator Ed- j
rounds of Vermont and former Speaker I
John G: Carlisle, who. by reason of his j

many years journal clerk of the House of
Representatives, and probably the hest-
Informed man In the House, on all ques
tions of parliamentary precedent.
The lnl'.uonce of women in Congressional
families Is ha\ Ing a great effect upon their
husbands and will throw many votes
against Mr. Roberts. Mrs. Joy, wife of
Representative Joy of Missouri, has un
dertaken to organize the sentiment of
wives of Representatives and has got up
a petition addressed to the House of Rep
resentatives in which tho ladlea ask their
husbands to exclude Mr. Roberts from the
House. Thus far Mrs. Joy has secured
more than JW) signatures. Every Repre
sentative's wife that she presented it to.
with only three or four exceptions, has
signed her name. The signatures are those
of the wives of Democrats as well as
those of Republicans. The petition will
be presented to the House on the li: - day
of the session.
Thus far political lines have not been
drawn in the Roberts case, and there Is no
evidence that they will be. If the Repub
licans could put the Democrats In the po
sition of upholding polygamy there is no
doubt they would quickly avail them
selves of, the political advantage that this
would give them. Many of the Demo
crat-, however, are just as earnest a.s tho
Republicans In their determination to ex
clude the polygnmist from the House.
They regret the fact that Mr. Roberts was
electo.l as a Democrat^ as that mere fact in
a measure connects him with the party.
Many of thorn would be glad if he would
resign his seat and thus take the trouble
some question out of politics altogether.
They have no doubt that if he should re
sign some other Democrat who is not a
polygamist would be elected to succeed
him. The representative of Utah in the
lost Congress was Mr. King, a Mormon,
but not a polygamist. No one objected to
him or. account of his religious belief and
he was an esteemed and influential mem
ber of the Democratic side of the house.
Mr. Roberts, however, has given no indi
cation of an Intention to gratify his fel
low Democrats by resigning. On the con
trary, he has distinctly declared that he
will not resign.

DEWEY PREFERS SUBIG
FOR A NAVAL STATION
WASHINGTON. Nov. Admiral Dew
*>>â  called at the Navy Department to-day
In response to a request from Secretary
Ix>ng to discuss the question of establish
ing a naval station at Cavlte or some oth
er point near Manila. Such a station Is
now in operation at Cavlte. but It Is fore-
Men that the requirements of the navy
may bo much greater than those which
are temporarily attended to .-it Cavlte.
The Admiral brought with him portions
of his report to be Incorporated In the full
report of the Philippine Commission. This
discusses the establishment of a perma
nent naval station in the Philippine.
and regards Sublg Bay. about sixty miles
from Manila, as preferable to Cavite. as
this is a, fine harbor of a considerable
depth of water and has many natural ad
vantages for making It a strong naval es
tabllshnient. Dewey's view will doubt-
Willie Admir.ti Dewey â  view will doubt
less prevail when a permanent station is
established, this will be for Congress to
deal with, and the present purpose is to
utilize the Cavite station for the current
work on the warships. Rear Admiral
GHUshas been mentioned as commandant
of the Cavlte station. Me was at the de
partment to-day and conferred with Sec
retary Long on the subject, but the Im
pression prevails that one of the younger
officers will be chosen.

One of tho best forty-eight dot? stakes

Great Interest will attach to its results by
reason of the fact that nearly half the

dogs were offered at the draw last night,
but the management could only accept
forty-eight, as the stake must be finished
In one day.

by Burns Astride the
Schorr Horse.
V a superior exhi
bition of poor Judn
mfnt "Tenti'
Vittltoe managed
to gtt May \V
beaten by Time
maker at Oakland
yesterday. Not that
the Schorr t
cannot repeat the
trick, but he should
not have accom
plished the ft-at In
this particular
race. It was Time
maker's initial bow
to the California public and 5 to 1 was laid
about him, while the Calgary mare ruled
a sizzling hot 1 to 2 favorite. In the
breakaway from the barrier Vlttitoe got
his mount away none too well and rated
her (or was compelled to, ' for he got
pocketed) to the stretch. Here he shook
on! Burns, on the Schorr entry, but in
stead of pulling out of the heavy going
next the rail, stayed there, and when
Tlmemaker put in his final bid Don Cam
eron's mare tossed it up and was beaten
out half a length. Rosormonde closed
very fust, and had the distance been half
a furlong further would undoubtedly have
luis-std both of the leaders.
It \NiUi another day of fiercely contested
finishes, with several disastrous dumps
for the talent. The riders all displayed
great eagerness to reach the wire llrst.
and as a consequence considerable bump
ing and jostling were indulged in. Gravita
and Reolia were the only two successful
favorites.
The sensation of the afternoon was fur
nished by Merry Hoy, Which defeated a
bunch of fast ones in the Anal seven-fur
long run, at odds of 20 to 1. He was rid
den by Henry, and while OHuthuh and
the favorite, Gauntlet, were engaging In
a bumping match the outsider won by a
head from the former horse. Dr. Kern
hula, the second choice, probably a trill*
short, finished a good fourth.
A nerve-trying 'ordeal marked the finish
of the two-mile selling run. Heolla, Billy
McCloskey and Stronio passing the judges
heads apart. The first named mare
showed rare gameness. besides getting an
excellent ride. Looking beaten half a mile
from the stand she answered Bullman's
call, pulling the acorn from out the coals.
Many were Inclined to think Thorpe took
Btromo too far out of the running and
then closed on the leaders too rapidly
when making his move. At best Stromo
is no wonder, and with different handling
might not nave been in the money.
Tizona, with 8 to 1 against his chances,
showed the way to the wire In the first
Brent, a five-furlong scramble for maidt-n

head from Zlska.
The second edition of this same race
went to J. NagW Burk's filly Gravita.
with Burns up. She was very groggy at
the wire, Just lasting long enough to nose
out Tom Bharkey, with Conley In the cad
die. Hindoo Princess ran third.
"Lucky" Baldwin's colors were carried
to the front by El Bistro in the mile sell-
Ing run, fifth to be decided. The mare had
second call In the ring, and driving hard
led the outsider. Tom Calvert. out a head.
The favorite, Favcrsham. tired nearing
the stand, taking third place.
Track Notes.
E. Ross, the very clever Middle Western
rider, viewed the races from the ground
yesterday. He is getting down to riding
weight by hicycle work and may be seen
in the saddle this afternoon.
Strongnll ran away two miles at the
track yesterday forenoon, ending up his
fun by turning a somersault over the
fence at the lirst turn.
Bmanuel Morris, the one-time crack col
ored rider, is in California again and win
â bortly be seen in the saddle once more.

SIX-DAY
RACE WON
BY REPINE
Adds Eighty-Seven M'lcs to
the Previous Forty-Eight-
Hour Record
Special DiÂ»patch to The Call.
KANSAS CXTT, Mo.. Nov. 27.-Bert Re
pine of Nashville. Tcnn., won the fort
eight hour bicycle race that began in Con
vention Hall on Tuesdru- afternoon of last
week. and. in winning the race, estab
lished a new record for forty-eight hours.
The distance overed. "â Â»! 1-3 miles. Is
87 1-6 miles better than the previous record
for a similar contest. Charles W. Miller
of Chicago. the heretofore unbeaten
champion of endurance races, made a de
termlneu effort to maintain his suprem
acy, but a* series of accidents on the track
âa punctured tire, a broken crank and
another mishapâ caused him to lose
ground that he could not recover from the
lucky Repine and the equally lucky
Swede. Oscar Julius, who rode without
â lip or mishap. _ , .
Julius finished second to Repine, a lap
behind, and Miller finished a lap behind
tho Swede. Young Gus Lawson of Chi
cago, the 13-year-old boy. who rode for
forty hours with the leaders, withered
under the hot pace of the last day and
finished nix laps behind the leader. Bos
ton's "Flyln" Dutchman." Frank v aller.
was a bad fifth. Hnlahlnj; turee-quarters
of a mile behind Repine.
Six others of the eleven starters had
dropped out earlier in the race. John
Chapman of Atlanta and Oscar I'lummer
of Kansas City fell out after eight hours.
Fred Nelson of Chicago went out on the
second day and John Lawson â¢â : Chicago
fractured his collar-bono by a fall and re
tired, after having ridden 324 miles. Ed
Llngenfelder of Chicago and I- 11. Nleder
hofer of Minneapolis quit this afternoon,
after having covered over 600 railed and
earning a Bhare of the purse.
Interest to-day centered In Champion
Miller, who was counted to sprint and
gain In the final struggle the laps lost
through hard luck. II" did pprint and
recovered two laps early in the ufternoon.
Then, late at night, he gained another lap.
placing him on an equal footing with tho
leaders.
But there proved to be another sprinter
In the person of Repine. A brass band flo
ured In the struggle. After the riders hnÂ«l
weathered a long sprint, without having
changed their positions, and were riding
easier, the band struck up "Dixie." The
effect upon the Southerner was electrlc.il.
His wheel shot to the front and before hUÂ»
competitors were aware of It ho was a
long way ahead. The band continued and
Repine continued and before th* la*t
strains of "Dixie" had died away Itcplno
had gained a lap on his pretty well
winded followers. This lead he held to the
end.
Repine will realize $400 and several
prizes for this week's work. Julius gets

QUAIL TOR NEW ZEALAND.
American Game Birds Shipped by
Order of the Colonial Gov
â¢-â¢ ernment.
The Commissioner of Forestry acJ.'ns
for the Government of New Zealand Is
going to stock the Government lands of
his colony with choice American g.imo
birds. The first consignment to go to
the land of the antipodes Is ilxty-threo
dozen of Kansas quail, which arrived In
this city yesterday and are at th< bird
storo of A. C. Roblson at 3.T* Kearny
street. They will be shipped by the Al
ameda. which leaves this port to-mor
row. The Kansas mall arÂ«Â» a smaller
species than our own California b'rda
but It Is said they are gamer and of a
higher flavor when placed on the break
fast plate.
Following this contingent will be sev
enty-two pairs of ruffled grouse, seventy
two pairs of prairie chickens and four
dozen of wood ducks, the whole to eorno
from Kansas.
It Is the Intention of thÂ»Â» N>w Zealand
Government, should this their first con
signment of American birds do well to
keei> adding more game stock until 'th.Â»
entire Government lands shall be wÂ»ll
stocked, when a distribution of â â â  birds
will be made to sporting reserves.
The present stock will, however, be nm .
ple to propagate from provided the. cold
atmosphere of New Zealand agrees with
the consignment. This in part Is the rea
son why the Kansas birds were selected
instead of the California.

SAN5 AN FRANCISCO policemen have to take off their helments to Oakland bobbles when It comes
to shooting at a mark. The first time they learned that les?on was one cold, raw March
morning in UK. when the sharpshooters of the Oakland department "put It on" to Lieu- v
tenant Na.Â«h's pqujul from this side of the bay by a score of 423 to 409.* For more than
three yrars they carried the sting of this defeat, practicing assiduously till the time came
wlj.n thÂ«y felt safe in meeting the men from the Oakland force. For "a few moments yes
terday it seemed to bÂ« the day. Ten cf the crack shots of Captain Wittman's division went over
to Shell Mound Park to shoot rivets into a like number of Captain Peterson's coppers.
"1 don't Â«^j how we can lose." said Sergeant Helms, in charge of the team,* to Captain
Wlttman. "It's a pipe we. do 'em!"
Serg^ar.t H<Â»lms doesn't see it ret. at It happened by a score of 422 to 417. and San Fran
cisco wu on the short end. although there seemed to be some consolation In the fact that Oak
land* poore was rzr.al\*r than bofore. while San Francisco's was larger.
The d.*y was is nearly ; -feet as could be wished for such a contest. The light may have
been Just a little bit too gray for me, but It was steady, and better scores all around were
expected. The conditions cf the match were, ten shots each. Winchesters 44 73. modern 200-yard
range, ten men to a tide. Ueutenant Nash was Judge for the San Francisco team and Major
Ton-.pkins. ex-Chief of Police and present City Clerk of Oakland, acted in a similar capacity for
Captain Peterson's men. Colonel H. J. Burns, one of the famous experts of the State who headed
the celebrated Crtedmoor team of 1577. was referee. In addition to the teams contesting there was
a number of Invited guests. Including ex-Chief Fletcher. Chief Hodgklns and Captain Wilson of
Oakland and Captain â¢man of this city.
The Oakland marksmen, while not openly fearful of the outcome, did not betray during the

tcs. One day last week, while his men were at the range practicing, he caused to be made
* and "lost." so it could be found next day when the Oaklanders went to practice, a padded
<c. showing that Fan Francisco ad made In practice 443 out of a possible 500. Next day as
Wted, or.c of Captain Peterson's men found It and there was dismay in the Oakland camp.
,c of the fly cops professed to see through the deception, but not one of them but feared It
too true.
This feelinsr ctill lingered beneath the Oakland bluecoat after several of the San Francisco
had stepped op to phoot a couple of "sighters," as they call them. A "slghter" is a shot at
mark to slve the shooter the range. It does not count on the score.

ARMSTRONG
WINS FROM
JEFFORDS
The Big Ca!i:ornian Knocked
Down and Out in the
Third Round.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
KBW YORK, Nov. T,.â The prize flÃht
between Bob Armstrong, the colored
be*> -Wright of Chicago, and Jim Jef
fords of California, which was slated to
go twenty-live .-.,.];. before the Herculos
Athletic Club to-night, ended abruptly in
the third round. Both men went head
foremost from a clinch over thÂ« ropes
Into a box at the ringside in the second
round, and In the third Jeffords took an
other header from the effects of a light
swing on the jaw. This took all the steam
out of the bi* fellow, and when he re
gained his feet he was sent sprawling by
v right swinging uppercut In the vicinity
of th* b*lt.
Jeffords rolled over In agony and his sec
onds claimed a foul on the ground that he
was hit below the belt. The referee de
cided that the blow landed fairly and gave
his verdict In favor of Armstrong after
Jeffords had been counted out and carried
to his corner Ly his seconds.
PENNANT WINNERS WILL
MEET ALL-EASTERNERS
A Great Game to Be Played at Recre-
ation Park on Thanks giving
Day.
"If the pennant winners think they will
have an easy time defeating the All-
Eastern aggregation in the series about
to be played at Recreation Park they will
be badly mistaken," said Jim McDonald,
the popular baseball umpire, who has the
picked nine under his wing.' "I am will
ing to bet that we take two out of the
three games played."
McDonald's confident opinion seems to
have pervaded the members of the whole
team and when they line up against the
victorious Sacrament an on Thursday
next they exjwcx to^prove tneir superior
ity. In preparation for the coming con
tacts, which have been eagerly looked
for by the "fans," the Eastern players
were out yesterday afternoon and took
the kinks out of their arms and bright
ened their eyes. The men are still In ex
cellent condition, having Just completed
successful seasons In various well-known
leagues.
"Auburn-haired" Harvey will pitch the
initial game for Sacramento, and a? ho
will have some strong batters opposing
him his strength as a twlrler will be
given a severe test. "Youngey" Johneon
will occupy the slab for the All-Eastern
ers. The game is likely to develop Into
a pitcher's battle, as both twiners are de
sirous of making a strong showing.
"Kid" Hulen. the phenomenal left-hand
ed shortstop, who Is to play third for
McDonald's nine, is the only man who
has not shown up for practice. The
"Kid" is tramping over the tules around
Dixon. his native town. McDonald and
friends have written to him to como at
once to the city and It is thought tie
will put in an appearance a few days be
fore the game. The second game of the
series will be played on Saturday and
Phil Knell and Doyle will be the opposing
pitchers. On Sunday afternoon Jimmy
Hughes star twirier of the National
League' will be In the box against his
eld cronies. The teams will line up as

The second annual banquet of the Mer
chants' Association took place at the Pal
ace Hotel last evening. It was the largest
gathering of business men upon such an
occasion In the history of Ban FrandÃCO.
There were present 461 merchants, and
there were many who came to attend the
banquet who were unable to find Beats
and went away. In other respects It was
& remarkable gathering. The presidents of
the two California universities made ad
dresses extolling the work In the line of
the practical education of men for busi
ness life. Hon. Arthur Rodgera gave the
history of "the f.rst college of c. mmorce
In the world." In every respect the affair
wan eminently e^ccessful.

Association presided. On his right was
President Wheeler of the University Âf
t'.ilifornia and on his left President ImvM
Jordan of the Stanford University.

The merchants were enthusiastic
throughout the evening. They greeted
President Wheeler when he was Intro
duced with a round of cheers, standing
They cheered Mayor Phelan when he en
tered the banqueting hall. They had
cheers for President Dohrmann and fre
quent applause punctuated the speeches
throughout the evening. The speakers
were President Dohrmajin. President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President David
Starr Jordan Hon. Arthur Rodgers, Pro
fessor Carl Plehn and Mayor Phelan.
President Dohrmann's address was one
of his best. He reviewed the history of
the Merchants' Association and told how
it started with small beginnings. "To
night." said he, "we have nearly five
hundred with us and over one hundred
were turned away. Five years ago there
were 35 members; last year 180. ' Re
calling what had been done he asked
what there was that the merchants could
not do? There had been Inscribed on the
banner of the association civic pride, civic
courage, civic patriotism, good citizen
ship. That was patriotism of the civic
kind that had cleaned the streets; that
had purified the regions where disease
would have been bred. That was the
courage that would yet give San Fran
cisco control of Its harbor. (Cheers.)
President Wheeler made a long address
responding to the toast. "The College of
Commerce In Its Practical Relation to

California^. There was nothing so easy
as It had been to him to become a Call
fornian and he was proud that he was
one. (Cheers.) He had lost interest in
all the duties of the college president ex
cept that at teaching the students; the
other duties he performed perfunctorily.
He gloried in the work of the association.
Public duty wa* the religion of civic life.
One of the most important parts of the
University of California was the college
of commerce. The merchants were a part
of that college: It appealed to their In
terests. The college needed funds to make
it a success and he appealed to the mer
chants to help It. Modern university edu
cation had become practical. College men
were in control of all the great electrical
enterprises of the country; they were the
leading men in all practical lines. Ger
many led as a commercial nation because
of her educated men who went abroad as
consuls. California would take first place
In the great commercial drama to be
played In thÂ» future. He appealed to the
merchants of California to grapple with
the restless, ractÂ»ty. young fellowâ the
next centuryâ and hold It up to its busi-
MM (Cheers.)
President Jordan responded to the toast.
"The Advantages of Higher Education to
Business Men." He caught the humor of
the merchants when he opened by ad
dressing them as "fellow millionaires and
comrades." He had no doubt of the fu
ture of democracy when he saw such
gatherings of business men. He seconded
the remarks of President Wheeler con
cerning the sort of men that Germany
sent abroad as Consuls, and added that
the United States needed the same kind
to represent it. He spoke also of the va-l
rious kinds of business men. Some failed'
because they did not know better, and
some because they would not believe that
any one knew better. Some failed be
cause there was profit in it; but these
were a class that he did not care to dis
curs. He counseled that all business men
should have ideals. There were collage
men with ideals and not much money who
would not trade them for a great deal of
money; there were also men with money
who would not trade it for ideals.
The activity of the world had traveled
westward. We were now midway. He re
gretted that some of our recent posses
sions had not come with more of a title
In Justice and honesty, but we now had
them, and we were bound to dominate the
world. But not one foot of land that had
to be kept in subjugation by bayonets
could ever truly be Incorporated into the
United States or England. The mission
of the Anglo-Saxon was not to subjugate,
but to permeate. Barriers were breaking
down in national affairs. The doors or
China would bo opened to the United
States, and the doors of the United States
would open to the Chinese. Our doors
had once been rightfully closed against
the Chinese, but that time had passed
away.
Regent Arthur Rodgers gave & history
of the College of Commerce of the Uni
versity of California, and urged that it
should have the active support and aid of
all merchants in the State. The college
waÃ for the merchant, and it was the op
portunity of the merchant to contribute
to its prosperity.
Professor Carl Plehn. dean of the Col
lege of Commerce of the University of
California^ responded to the toast: "A
Commercial Museum for San Francisco."
He adduced many Interesting facts.
Before introducing Mayor Phelan to the
members of the association President
Dohrmann read the results of a postal
card vote taken on the needs of the city.
It was as follows: For a new sewer sys
tem, 573 in the affirmative and 3 in the
negative; for constructing new school
houses, 567 ayes and 11 noes; for a new
County Hospital. 571 ayes and 3 noes; for
a new park panhandle,' 353 ayes and 1.-6
noes. The president dwelt on the differ
ence In opinion on the last improvement
and explained the vote. He said It re
quired a two-thirds vote and he was
pleased to say the votes In the affirmative
were Just enough.
The Mayor wan given an ovation when
he arose to address thÂ« assemblage, and
when the enthusiasm had subsided he de
livered a splendid speech on "The Wants
of San Francisco." At the outset he Joc
ularly remarked that he knew his listen
ers were all busy men and that they
worked In the daytime, therefore, as the
wants of the city were so numerous, he
would not attempt to describe them to
night. He congratulated the association
on the good work it was doing and on
what it had accomplished since its or
ganization. He then took' up the result
of the postal card vote read by the chair
man, and sold It was a good augury,
as If the business men of this city, who
are the taxpayers, believe in these im
provements he felt assured that the work-
Ing does would follow their example and
vote accordingly. He dwelt at length en
the advisability of extending the panhan
dle and regretted that the vote against it
was to large.
In a clear argument he showed how
valuable It would be to the. city to make
such an Improvement; how it would at
tract the tourists of the country, and how
the latter would benefit the merchants
and the people by their presence In this
city; how by the purchase of a small park
between the park and the Presidio the
city would extend it" magnificent breath
ing spot, as the 1500 acres would virtually
bo a part of the park although still owned
by.jiie. Government. He congratulated tÂ£*

that this would not have been accom
plished but for the fact that the organiza
tion was composed of 12"0 of the best
citizens of the city. At. the conclusion of
his splendid speech he was roundly ap
plauded.
In closing the banquet President Dohr
mann expressed the hope that next year
would find the association larger In num
bers, and that it would again meet as It
had last night. When he concluded T the

February 16.
SHERIFF FARLEY'S MURDERER
PRISONER DISPT*AYED NO
EMOTION.
Â»
Laughed Aloud in the Courtroom
When Judge Dorn Pronounced
the Words Fixing His
Fate.
6pÂ«c!al Dispatch to The CUL
SALINAS. Not. 27.â George Suisser. who
murdered Henry R. Farley. Sh-riff of
Monterey County, on the night of Septem
ber IS, waa to-day sentenced to be handed
on February 16. The court room was
crowded when thu sentence was pro
nounced by Judge Dorn. but during the
entire ordeal the murderer m.-ver so much
as quailed; and when the final words con
demning him to death were uald the eyes
. ( : ... prisoner and the Judge met and the
former laughed audibly, continuing; to
smile for some time.
Several times during his Honor's speech,
and especially at such times as the re
marks were most scathing, the defendant
would look In toe direction of friends and
wink or smile. Such utter bravado dis
played by a criminal has never before
been witnessed in this court.
Attorney Lacey to-day moved for a new
trial in the case and made a most stub
born right for his client. The motion was
denied, however, and then Judge Dora
said in substance as follows:
"On the 9th day of October the District
Attorney filed an Information In this court
charging that you, George Suisser, did
willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and with
malice aforethougut murder one Henry H.
Farley. In this county, on the ISth day of
September, 1*99. You were arraigned on
the charge and pleaded not guilty. Before
a jury you were compelled to defend your
self for deliberate murder. You were rep
resented by able counsel and an earnest
defense was made for you by your attor
ney. All must be convinced that every
thing was done for you that was possible.
The Jury returned its verdict finding you
guilty of murder in the first degree. Sev
eral matters which you have urged as af
fecting the validity of that conviction
have all been carefully examined and
seem to have no foundation in fact and to
be unsupported by the law. There la no
revenge In the sentence of law. neither is
there passion or prejudice. Still we must
notice that the evidence shows your crime
to have been one of peculiar atrocity.
There was no excuse for it whatever. The
sentence which the law imposes Is awful;
but all civilized people have deemed it
necessary that In such cases It should be
go. Now, therefore, it la - ordered, mi-
Judged and decreed that you, George Suls
ser. be hanged by the neck until you are
dead."
Acknowledged a Brave Act.

Carelessness of Chemist Southard
Causes Damage in the City Hall.
ThÂ» carelessne&s of Assistant Chemist
O. C. Southard of the Board of .Health,
caused considerable .lama*- to the floors
and celling In the City Hall. The discov
ery was made by Janitor J. Berliner early
yesterday morning. It appears that South
ard was distilling ether on last Saturday
evening and permitted water to run
through the rubber tubing connected with
th f condenser in the laboratory on the
third floor. He neglected to turn the wa
ter off when he left and In some manner
the hose became disconnected and thÂ«
water streamed out at will. it had been
running for thlrty-!Â«tx hours before Jan
itor Berliner appeared on the scene, ani
lanc<Â» quantities of water had poure.l
down on the lower floors. The greatest
damage was done In the Assessor 7*7 * office
and the celling had become so moistened
that the plastering Is likely to fall off In
places. The clerks were kept busy gettlnc
the records of the office out of harm's way
and It required two dozen buckets to col
lect the wane waters that cam* throurh
the celling.
MALICIOUS MISCHIEF.
Salesman Neil Hurls PaintpoU
Through a Window.
Fred Neil, a salesman employed by A.
Conrelch. a Sixth street merchant, was
arrested last night by Policeman Naylor
and booked at the City Prison on â¢>
charge of malicious mischief. Neil was
detailed by his employer to go to a neigh
boring paint shop and purchase some
paint. The salesman left the store about
5 o'clock and returned about two hours
later with the paint and a beautiful mel
low Jag. He staggered Into the store an<l
asked < onrelch to give him enough money
to continue his spree. His employer re
fused to advance him any money and ad
vised him to go home and take a sleep
Nell became Indignant at this sugges
tion and he went outside the door and
threw two pots of paint through the show
window.

San Francisco lags behind other large American
cities in respect to the extent of her park area. While
Broadway, New York, beginning at the Battery, it
self a beautiful park, passes on its way Bowling Green,
L r.-.on square and Madison square. Market street is
from one end to the other an unbroken array of
building*. There is no place of beauty and preenery
f adorn the long rows of its houses. Nor is there
present any grand access to Golden Gate Park
â rom the downtown districts. The extension of the
j'cnhar.d'e would therefore be something like a revo
lution in the aspect of the city, giving it an artistic
feature hardly inferior to any on the earth.

ThÂ» extension of the panhandle to the junction of

provided when Golden Gate Park was laid out, but
it is not too late to repair the mistake. It has been
estimated that the cost of the proposed improvements
xill not entail for interest and for the "â¢ring fund
a tax levy in excess of 10 cents on every $100 of the
present assessment- Thr.t is but a small amount to pay
for an avenue which will in matmitude and in beauty
be a not unworthy rival of the Champs E!ysees, whose
delightful drives and promenades have done much to
hdp make Paris the center of attraction of the mod
ern world.
The iÂ«si".e. we repeat, xs one which should engage
the attention of all progressive citizens. Every man
who takes enough interest in San Francisco to care
for its welfare should unite in promoting the present
movement for park extension, for if it be defeated at
the coming election there is no telling when it can be
undertaken again with prospects of success.

â  an foi
parole, for he -ass not an ofneer oi the United States,
and such parole would have been worthless and to
shoot prisoners for violating it would .... been mur
der. Therefore it was that Wildman, representing this
Government, was advising officially an act of nation
ality to be exercised by the Philippine government.
On June 25, iS-yS, Wildman, ho had beer. pro
moted to be Consul General, wrote officially to
Aguinaldo: "Do not forget that the United States
undertook this war for the sole purpose of relieving
the Cuban? from the cruelties under which they were
â¢ suffering and not for the love of conquest or the hop
jof gain. They are actuated by precisely the same
! feeling toward the Filipinos." Mr. Wildman is still
! Consul General. His proclamation for a Philippine
! government, his advice that it exercise one of the
â¢
tary parole, under death penalty, and his omcial
i pledge that his Government rated Cuba and the Phil
j ippines together: his ofneial report to this Govern
j mem of the existence of a civil government in the
; Phillipines, "administered with dignity and justice"
by Aguinaldo â all stand without disavowal by our
Government and he remains in ofnee as our repre
sentative. .
In addition to this it appears, in Consul Wildman's
; letters, that the funds of the Philippine government,
! consisting ii part of the payment made by Spain to
I close the revolution of 1896, were put in his hands
' in Hongkong to buy arms and munitions of war for
i Aguinaido's government, and that he acted in con
cert with Agoncillo in the purchase and shipment of
1 arms on the steamer Pasig from neutral ports. It
j further appears that this steamer was "captured" or
detained by British authorities in Hong) 1 with
; arms on board purchased by 'man, and that upon
â  her release he sent her to Macao to clear from there
i to Canton, in the latter port to receive arms bought
with the Filipino funds.
It appears, then, that this Consul General, as proved
by his own correspondence, was encaged in violating
' the neutrality laws and defying the neutral rights of
â¢ both China and Great Britain. Under the rule estab
lished in the Alabama case Spain would have a recov
ery against Great Britain and China for this violation
â of their rights as neutrals. Mr. Wildman appears,
â  then, by the testimony, as ratifying Pratt's agreement,
i which Howard Bray, who witnessed it, says was "a
; promise of independence"; as the author of the
i proclamation establishing Aguinaido's government,
; its adviser in acts highly national, its agent in the
: purchase and shipment of arms, and as not changing
j this attitude until he was sued for Filipino money
1 remaining in his hands in the British courts at Hong
kong. Will some one explain the mystery of Pratt's
â  dismissal and Wildman's retention? And will some
one explain how the United States, retaining him in
I office, can avoid the responsibility for promises made
; and engagements entered into by him in the name of
, this Government?
THE SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.
SENATOR II ANN A is reported to have stated
in a recent interview at Clevelan4 that the ship
subsidy bill, which failed of passape owing to
lack of time in the iast Congress, will be taken up
;n the coming session and advanced as rapidly
as possible. He declared a sanguine expectation thit
.1 would be passed at this session, but stated:
"It will be fiercely opposed by a strong lobby backed
capital."
That foreign capital should interfere to prevent
American legislation and find Americans ready to
â  it may sound strange, but it will not be the
first time such a thing has happened. It was largely
through the influence of foreign steamship companies
that immigration restriction bills have been beaten
â  it is foreign capital that is nuw,
the past. g the construction of the
Nicaragua canal and pushing the Panama scheme in
it* place. The foreigners who are opposed to the up
building of the American merchant marine are many
and their interests in the matter are great, for at
Dt they derive immense profits from their trade
r American commerce, and the transfer of
that b ' 'hips under our own flag would mean
every foreign steamship line that has been
engaged in American trade.
m the reports that come to us it is not clear
whether the bill which Senator Hanna purposes to
urge at the coming session is the Hanna-Payne hill
or that which was introduced by Senator Frye 35 a
v The original bill was subjected to
no little criticism and attack, but since the adjourn
ment of Congress has been thoroughly discu c Â«ed ani
appears to have won the favor of many who were
originally opposed to it. It is to be noted, however,
that in the annual report of Mr. Chamberlain, Com
missioner of Navigation, a summary of which was re
cently published in The Call, the main argument was
port of the Frye bill, and it is therefore
probable that is the one which will be, preferred by
the adminietratv.n.
In reviewing the subject the Commissioner pointed
out t'r.ki the n aximum expenditure under that bill for
Tin: sax FRAxnsro caw, tttesdaT, koybiiier as. is:> 9.
anj one year :s fixed at $9,000,000, from which, how
ever, should be deducted $1,500,000, the present cost
of carrying our ccc^n mails on American vessels,
which will continue, whatever the fate o: the bill may
be. The actual maximum annual expenditure pro-
p OJC( i by the I 1k Â« effect fixed at $7,500,000.

EUROPEAN RAILWAY PLANS
I *QR the purpose of exploiting Asia and Africa
the nations of Europe have outlined r
* plans on an immense scale. The great Siberian
road, at which Russia has been so long working,
is of course the most p:^antic of these enterprises
and has attracted m :on, but there are others
well worthy of note.
One of the mooted schemes is that of constructing
a railway from a Mediterranean port across Asia
Minor and through the valley of the Euphrates to the
Persian Gulf. Such a road would be largely under
the control of the Turk, and that fact is all which
has thus far prevented a beginning of the work. Rus
sia, Germany and Great Britain are each of them will
ing to undertake it, but neither has been able to ob
tain the concession because of the opposition of the
other two. That road, therefore, may be an enter
prise in the air only for some time to come, but the
recent rearrangements that have been going on be
tween Great Britain and Germany may result in some
agreement that will provide for the work.
A movement which will doubtless give an impetus
to the Siberian line and will materially aid it in com
peting for trade has been started in Sweden for the
extension of the Swedish state railroads to the port
of Kappelsk?.r, from which there is to be a line of
steamers to Hango. in Finland, where there is con
nection with the Siberian road. It' is believed that
with the powerful ice-breakers which modern mechan
i-m has devised it will be possible to keep these ports
open all winter and thus provide a continuous traffic.
Should the plan succeed Siberian trade with Great
Britain and the western world generally will pass
- Sweden and not across Germany, unless the
Kaiser should prevent the loss by constructing bet
ter roads and giving cheaper rates than Sweden can
afford.
In Africa many roads are planned. Every nation
that has taken a share of the continent is preparing
to buiM one or more railways for the purpose of de
velopiiiÃ and holdinÃ the territory acquired. At the
close of 1890 there were le?s than 6000 miles of rail
way in operation in Africa, but at the present time the
mileage is double that, and it is said lines for whose
completion financial arrangements have been already
made will add 2500 miles more to the total. That,
however, is but the beginning. The Germans have
projected a road to Tanffanyika, the French one
from Algeria to the Soudan, and the Belgians one
from the Congo to the Nile. Even excluding Cecil
Rhodes' project of a railway from Cairr to Cape
y. it is <-aid to be a conservative estimate that
within a decade there will be fully 25.000 miles of rail
road in operation in
When these vast enterprises have been completed
and the machinery of modern industry and trade is
carried freely into the desens and the wildernesses of
Asia and Africa there will be a mighty change r*>t
only in those two continents but in the world. The
coming century, if it do not begin with a general
war nver the prospective spoils, will start with an
industrial activity too vast to be comprehended by
foresight. It is in vain the barbarian protests and
fights against civilization. Where there is machinery
it must be kept moving.

COMMITTEE TO MEET
TO SAVE THE WATER
The first meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California Water and Forest
Association will open next Saturday aft
ernoon In this city. There are twenty
nine members of the committee and the
most of them are expected to he present,
as the work In hand is the framing of the
whole work of the association for a lon*
period. According to Secretary Fried
lander there are many things to be con
sidered. The plan of raising money for
the preliminary expenses suggested by
William Thomas, the president of the as
sociation, will probably be brought for
ward. Mr. Thomas thinks It will not be
difficult, by thoroughly organizing the
friends of irrigation In all parts of the
State, to get 25,000 members to pay 13 each
for membership dues. Some plan is nec
essary to get the requisite funds to pro
vide for the current expenses for some
time, as the struggle will be long before
the Impounding of the State's flood waters
can be accomplished.
The campaign, it Is recognized, will be
one of education, and there will be some
way provided to bring all persons and con
cerns into touch that may co-operate for
the common end. President Thomas be
lieves that all the committee members
will have some well delinod ideas on this
and other branches of the association's
work. The call for the first meeting of
the committee was delayed that all might
have a chance to think various matters
over at leisure. The constitution and by
laws are more matters of form to be con
sidered, for the principal provisions were
adopted by the convention ns a whole â
those relating to organization.
Probably the committee will not be able
to flnlsh its work in one day. If all mat
ters have not been disposed of by Satur
day night the consideration will be pro
longed until final determination can be
reached. One of the questions to arise
will probably be the enlistment of Con

GAGE MAY APPOINT A
UNITED STATES SENATOR
Burns Would Prefer an Extra
Session of the Legislature.
The Governor May Settle the Question by
Selecting General Barnes or Irving
M. Scott for the Toga.
THERE is a deal of talk In political
circles that Oovemor Gage will
Bet tie the (juestlon of the vacant
Benatorshlp for the present by ap
pointment. The talk is prompted by
the reports from Washington that the
Peniite will admit Mr. (juay of Pennsyl
vania on his certificate of appointment by
the Oovernor of that StatÂ«v
It Is known that the Governor of Cali
fornia 1b not chnrmed with the Idea of
calling the members of the legislature
together in extra session, and If he can
tlnd any way of filling the vacancy other
than the special session plaa be will not
hesitate to grasp it.
The question Is frequently asked. Whom
will the Governor appoint? Six months
ago the opinion wm universally expressed
that D. M. Ruins would be named, but
the views of politicians in this regard
have undergone a change. .Men who were
next to Hums at Sacramento last winter
and still retain his confidence assert posi
tively that the colonel will not SCO
commission by appointment. He i-; nn.x
i'.us for an extra session, believing or pro
fessing to belleVe that he would lie the
caucus nominee Stories to the effect that
Burns has the promise of a sufficient
number of votes to control the proposed
caucus have no more foundation In fact
than the frequently repeated Statement!
Inst winter had that he would be elected
(1 Thursday."
There Ik one good reason why Burns
does not desire to be appointed to the
I'nlted States Senate. He is fully 00D
hcIous of the fact that his term of service
In the Senate would be brief. He recog
nizes that the Senator appointed by Gov
ernor Gage must be the Republican can

LANE HELPED
FREE SILVER
AND MR. BRYAN
How the Money Was
Handled.
Dispatches received in San Francisco
from New York and Chicago disclose the
fact that a suspicion exists In th.- Ea.st
that the Democratic National Committee
received large Bums of money In IS%
which were not accounted for. The rumor
Is circulated that Charles D. I/inÂ« con
tributed a handsome sum of money to the
campaign fund and that there Is no record
of the receipt of the contribution.
Inquiries made among the \\> 11-informed
Democrats In San Francisco do not estab
lish the truth of the statement that I.nne
contributed directly to the Democratic
campaign fund. Kane li a cheerful giver.
He nave so generously of his means to
help the cause of the free tllverltea that
he was advised by his business associates
to beware of the bunko schemes of clever
politicians. The impression exists that
Lane personally assisted Bryan, but me
extent of the assistance is not mentioned.
"The fact that C D. Lane spent per
haps $100,000 in the Interest of Mr. Bryan
and free silver is not any secret." said a
member of the silver party's State execu
tive committee of 1&36. "Of course, when I
say Lane. I mean Lane and Hobart. for
I understood that they contributed joint
ly. Of this money about JSO.OOO was given
to the national committee, $20,000 to the
State silver party and I believe $1000 to the
Democratic State Central Committee. A
great deal has been said about the ex
penditure of Lane's money In this State,
and that much of it was squandered. Peo
pie who talk this way are not acquainted
with the facts. The silver party's finances
were handled in the. most businesslike
way, and Mr. Lane was really personally
responsible for the contraction and pay
ment of every bill.
"The silver committee in this State orig
inated with Mr. Lane. He did not coincide
with some of the methods of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, and de
cided to have an independent campaign.
He named all the officers of the commit
tee, and 1 think that among them were
Attorney George W. Baker and ex-Senator
Frank J. Moffltt. The, executive commit
tee planned a very complete campaign,
and Mr. Lane attended to the financial
end. Every bill was authorized from his
ofttce. and after being Indorsed by Judge
Lawlor and the oJÃoen of the executive
committee it was taken back to Lane's
office. In the Hobart building, where his
own bookkeeper and cashier finally audit
ed it and paid the money. The. books
showing the handling of the campaign
fund show that It was one of the most
businesslike pieces of politics ever done
in this State.
"If I remember aright, the Democratic
State Committee asked Lane and Hay
ward for a contribution and received
$1000. but I am not certain of this, though
I know the rum was no larger
"But it was to the national committee
that Lane gave the most coin. At the
St. Louis sliver convention Lane paid for
almost everything. Had It not been for
him the hall micht not have been ob
tained, and he gave Immense sums to the
prosecution of the campaign."

tlcal sagacity to comprehend that he
would be beaten out of sight were the
question submitted to the people. Hence
he desires an extra session of the existing
Legislature, so that if chosen his term
would last Jive years.
Since the inauguration of thp f
Republican Stnt- administration Burns
has secured pretty much all the patron
age at the disposal of the Governor, fto
much has been given that Gage is quoted
as saying: "Burns has had enough, and
I propose to recognize others." Politician?
do not regard it as a sure thing by any
means that Burns will be tendered tre
Senatorial appointment. There is plenty
of gossip to the effect that General Bar i. s
Is highly regarded by the Governor. Irv
ing IL Scott Is also mentioned as another
favorite. It Is common rumor that *'â¢;{%>â 
entertains lofty admiration for the ora
torical abilities of General Barnes, and
fancies the general would, as I
States Senator, retlect great honor on
California. Again, it Is asserted that Gen
eral Barnes, as the logical Republican
nominee before the Legislature whl--h
convenes In January. 1901. would display
such ability In the campaign nex
that the Republicans wuld run the \a-k-
Islatnre, even if Mayor Phelan wtth his
local prestige were put forward as the
millionaire candidate of the Democratic
party.
All the politicians agree that the ap
pointed Senator must be the recognized
nominee of the Republican party at the
next regular session of the Legislature.
<>f course, the Governor could appoint at
the present time and call an exrr;i
of the Legislature next summer to Indorse
the appointment or elect a new man. but
sneb a proceeding is highly Improbable, as
there is a limit to the patience of the peo
ple.
on Mayor Phelan's statement that Rlck
ard bad nnly acted In the line of his duty
and that n>> statutory officer could be al
li wed extra pay for overtime the claim
was not allowed.

CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS
Deputy Surveyor St. John and Deputy
Naval Officer Maslin Will Take
the Non-Competitive.
Deputy Customs Surveyor Chauncey m.
St. John and Deputy Naval Officer Edwin
W. Maslln received ye.Â«terday from the
president of the Civil Service Commlss'on
at Washington a notice that they would
be required to take the non-competitive
examination provided for by the rules and
by the terms of President McKlnley s
proclamation of last May. Th â¢ proclana
tion of the President provide.* that the
officers named, together with some others,
shall be exempt from the civil service
provisions and shall be required to take
it non-competitive examination for the
purpose, of testing the capacity of tiie
appointed person for the officÂ».
The news created considerable talk In
the Custom-house among those who did
not understand the fiÂ«,j>,. of the Presi
dent* proclamation, anil it was reported
that the notice to stand the examination
was an indication that the two deputies
named were to be placed under the man
tle of civil service. This report Is un
founded. The rule Is that the deput.es
named and special deputies like Stanley
Jackson not under civil service shall take
a â competitive examination in order
to determine whether the incumbents are
competent to discharge the duties of the
ofllce. ThÂ» s:.mÂ«- rule applies to the chief
deputy in '.he office of the Collector of In
ternal Revenue. It is expected that Mr.
Jackson will receive a similar notice In a
day or two.

en the subject of rules of the House. The

tional Convention-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MILWAUKEE. Nov. 27.â Henry C.
Payne, the Wisconsin member, will pre
sent at the meeting of the National Re
publican Committee In Washington, on
December 12, a resolution recommending
a change In the basis of representation la
future Republican national conventions.
The resolution Is as follows:
Whereas, The present baaia of representation
In national conventions Ik unjust and unequal,
and believing that this Injustice should l>- rem
edied: therefore
Resolved, That the Republican National Com
mittee recommend to the next national conven
tion that a new b&nls of representation be es
tablished as follows: Each State to be entitled
to four delegates at large and one additional
delegate for each 10.000 votes, or fraetloln
thereof, cast at the last Presidential election
for Republican electors; and four delegates
from each organlzt-d Territory and â â â *â  District
of lumbla: and be it further
Resolved. That In allotting delegates to the
several Mates as provided, aside from dele
Â»ateÂ» at large, thÂ«y shail M divided a- nearly
as practicable among the several Concessional
districts of the State: the basis shall be the
same, and where It Is necessary to unite one
or more Congressional districts for thÂ« purpose
of carrying out this resolution contiguous dis
tricts may be united.
If the plan proposal by Mr. Payne be
recommended by the National Committee
and a\dopt*d by the convention, Alabama
would have nine delegates. Arkansas
eight. Flordla five, Georgia ten. Louisiana
Â«lx. Mississippi live and South Carolina
liveâ â  total of 49. Instead of 121, as under
thÂ»- present apportionment.
The other til I rÂ«eni â  would be: Colorado
one, Idaho one, -Montana onÂ»\ Nebraska
two. Nevada on*. North Carolina two,
Tennessee live), Texas nine. Utah one, Vir
ginia six and Wyoming one.
The Increases would be: California ono.
Connecticut three. Illinois seventeen, In
diana six. lowa seven. Maryland two.
Massachusetts two. Michigan five. Minne
sota live. New Hampshire two, New Jer
sey six, Hew York fourteen. North Da
kota one. Ohio eleven. Oregon one. Penn
sylvania thirteen, Vermont one. West Vir
ginia two and Wisconsin seven.
The representation of the other States
would remain as now. The total number
of delegates would be KM, as at present.

MARVELOUS TESTS OF
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
Messages Successfully Sent by Milwaukee
Scientists Through the Walls of
Fireproof Vaults.
CHICAGO. Nov. 27.â Professor W. S. Johnson and C. I* Portler of Milwau
kee to-day made a successful twit In this city of the wireless telegraph. They
succeeded In telegraphing without wires through a suite of seven rooms with
all doors closed and through seven walls.
Another test was made, when the signals were conveyed through three fire
proof vaults and an ordinary telegraph switchboard, in which thirty wires
were connected and about forty dead wires were located.
Notwithstanding the fact that this Fwltchboard contained live wires, thÂ«
current passed through all <>f the vaults and through this board. Tills Is one
of the most severe tests that has ever been given wireless telegraphy.
A third test was made. In which the sending instrument was placed Inside
of one of the flteol vaults and both doors were closed and the combination lock
turnod. The f=lÂ»;nrUs were then transmitted clearly from the Inside of the
vault to an adjoining room.
The professor claims that his Invention Is materially different from that
of Marconi, and that instruments may be constructed to be carried on horse
t>ack and be ready for operation within a few moments after they have
reached their destination.
The sending instrument used to-day was intended for Fhort distances only.
The receiving Instrument, however, was complete and ready for use at any
distance.

WIDE-TIRE LAW
IS A FAILURE
Crave Errors Render It
Inoperative.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
SACRAMENTO. Nov. Friends of the
good-roads movement throughout the
State will not receive with satisfaction
the announcement that the wide-tire law,
passed by the Legislature two years ago in
the Interest of better highways, and to &o
Into effect January 1. 1&00, will In all prob
ability not be enforced because of the
clumsy errors which appear In It. This
law was one which had been successfully
tried In other States and by the advocates
of good roads in California It was re
garded as a most beneficial measure. The
defects In the law as bungled through tho
Legislature relate to the descriptions of
the axles In defining them for stated tire
widths. For example. It speaks of a "steel
or thimblc-skeln axle," when It means a
steel or Iron thimble-skein axle, and a
"tubular or Iron axle," when It means a
tubular Heel or Iron axle. The strange
thing about the whole matter Is that tho
6tate Bureau of Highways, while working
for four years at a cost to the people of
fso.ooo. could not contrive to get through
the Legislature a law representing what
they wanted and that would have been
couched In proper terms.
Commissioner J. L. Maude blames As
semblyman Linderberger for the mistake
and says that If the question Is not agi
tated too much he will get another bill
through the next Legislature. Meanwhile,
however, the expense of keeping up the
Department of Highways will have to be
borne by the taxpayers, and the good
roads movement will remain where It was
before legislation was attempted In Its
interest.

BpÂ»ctal Ditpatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Nov. 27.â Nothing Is known
at headquarters in this division or In Gen
eral Lee 1 to justify the report, published
in the Unltod States and cabled back here,
that 1000 armed Insurgents have taken to
the woods on the province of Plnar del
Klo, and that a general uprising against
jjne Americana nas been plannea for
Ihanksglvlni; day. Indeed, the story is
absolutely discredited by the American
authorities, who gay It U lmposiilble that
anything of th 0 kind Bhoula have hap
pened or should be In prospect without
knowledge of it coming to some army
pO9u
Humors of a more or leas alarmist char
acter have for some time been plentiful
around Havana. It ia said, for Instance,
that this general or that is about to take
to the woods, and It la apparently true
tnat certain men are nursing programmes
hostile to the American administration.
But tha spread of the campaign of educa
tion is doing a great deal to offset the in
fluence of such people, and In any event
no trouble whatever la likely to occur un
til after Congress meets.
It is a fact, however, that many Ameri
cans here believe that If nothing is done
toward giving the Cubans some definite
assurances, if not a precise date, regard
ing, the independence of the Island, there
will be a rising of some sort, although
opinions differ widely with regard to what
It will amount to. Some believe that the
ma contents will be practically bandits
easily controlled by a few troops. Others
hold that the rising would be formidable
and would call for a large American
force.

NEW DISCOVERIES
AT CAPE NOME
All Streams Are Rich
in Gold.
CAPE YORK DIGGINGS GOOD
FUEL IS BECOMING VERY HARD
TO GET.
Beach Wood Not Very Serviceable
and the Price of Coal Wrj?
Been Raised to $125
Per Ton.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
TACOMA. Nov. 27.â New discoveries of
gold are constantly being made In the
vicinity of Nome. In fact It seems that
almost every stream In that part of the
country has the precious metal on its
banks. It Is stated in the Nome Geld
Digger of November 1, received here via
Vancouver, that, outside of Cape York,
the place attracting the moat attention at
Nome is Solomon River. In Bonanza dis
trict ground along the river Is rich and
color shows for a long distance on both
sides of Discovery.
From Shovel Creek, which empties Into
the Solomon River, about three miles be
low Discovery, nuggets valued at from $2
to $S have been taken. Small tributary
streams are being thoroughly prospected
and de^lopment work will be pushed
next season. Shovel Creek has been callod
the Snow Gulch of the district, so rich are
the diggings. Streams running into it
which contain gold are: Boston, Mystery.
\* eat, Adams, Kasson and Topnotch.
Beyond Solomon River nothing Is known
or the country, although several parties
or prospectors went there last summer.
Herbert Murray, a mining man who has
had experience in many of the greatest
mining camps of the world, says In an In
terview in the Gold Digger: "The most
valuable features the Nome placers pos
sess are their similarity to early Califor
nia placers. They are Bhallow, hardly
ever exceeding five feet to bedrock. This
mean* that the ground may bo easily and
rapidly prospected and that gold may be
extracted quickly and at light expense,
there being little non-paying dirt to re
move before reaching a pay streak."
Murray says further: "Besides the
placer diggings, numerous ledges of high
grade quartz have been located back in
the foothills, but as yet no one has pros-
PP f < "Â£ ted . systematically for lode claims. In
Jaw Nome will produce more gold than
has ever come out of any camp in a single
year since ISO." ,
The same Issue of the Gold Digger con
tains an Interview with Peter Nielsen,
who. with Henry Thellen and James Syl
vester, returned from Cape York a few
days previous. About the conditions at
lork, Nellsen said: "Our party found
colors in several places. We did not have
time to prospect because all miners were
stampeding- and staking, and we had to
get In and stake first and then size things
up afterward. The richest claim was the
original discovery on Buhner Creek. All
those I talked to said they had found
colors on the surface in the creeks. Sev
?>Â».Â£ "Vi e iT obt ained from Moonlight
t reek, and they can be got anywhere.
There will ibe some prospecting this
Â£ h-^ # n ',7 V" most , Ca f,^ wood wl Â«l have
to be hauled several miles.
â¦ ââ¦ hen , we left there were twenty-seven
tents and six dugouts at Cape York The
site of the town Is much like the site of
Nome, except that It is all on the tundra,
and tundra Is dryer. The mountains corn:
mence a quarter of a mile back. The bi â -
gest river la , the Anowkogok. which at its
mouth carries about half the water that
the Snake River does. Its headwaters are
h!I&h lW Th c Â» or nyn v5 teen ~ mll Â« from the
beach. The beach at Cape York does not
seem to have been prospected yet "
CHICAGO. Nov. 57.-the Record's spe
cial correspondent at Cape Nome semis
the following letter, dated November I:
â¢10-morrow the last boat, the Albion,
will leave Cape Nome, and from then un
til next June this country will bo shut
off from the outer world. There has been
a great exodus of people, and most of
those who were here early have gone out
those staying behind being largely men
who came down from the upper river to
get claims. It will do them little good
however, as the country is thoroughly
covered and the owners have gone away
co that those coming with money cannot
buy. There will be practically no work
done this winter, as there is no wood on
the creeks to thaw with, so that outÃide
those finds developed last summer nothing
will be known until late next summer.
There are a few stampede to creeks In
outlying districts that happened to be
overlooked in the first rush. Recent re
ports from CapÂ« York are less favorable
than the first ones, but as no work has
been done little is known for certain and
cannot be until next summer.
"In Cape Nome and the outlying dis
trict along the coast from Golovln Bay to
Cape York probably 2500 people will' re
main during the winter. Many were
frightened by the probability of advan
tage being taken of the scarcity of on
article to Jump up the price. No con
science has been shown so far in regard to
the taking advantage of the necessities of
the people. Coal and lumber have boen
cornered, and both of these necesslt'es
are selling at exorbitant rates. The exo
dus and the arrival of late steamers have
made the food supply ample
but prices are higher than* at
Dawson. Fuel will be the most
serious problem. Coal In tolling as filth
as $125 per ton now. and there Is a limited
supply. The beach wood by hauling a
long distance will help out. but it Is poor
stuff and will be very expensive. In Cape
Nome some, are going to sled over to Go
lovln Bay to winter In the timber, and
some are building cabins on the beach,
where the driftwood Is close at hand.
"The typhoid epidemic is about over.
ThÂ«ye have been no new cases In the laÂ»t
five days, and no more are expected until
spring. .Back of the beach, which Is nnr
row, the tundra Is an undrained. swampy
flat, and when the frost Is out Is a rich
breeding place for the fever germs."

A Real Count in the
Forty-Sixth.
LEOPOLD THUN OF AUSTRIA
MADE A FIRST LIEUTENANT BY
THE PRESIDES TS FAVOR.
lie Has Reported for Duty With the
Recruits Banding His Assign
mti.t to His Command
in the Islands.
The Forty-sixth Infantry has Just
earned rhe distinction of having a Count
âa real Austrian Countâ added to its
muster roll. The Count is Leopold Thun.
an officer of the Austrian cavalry, and he
t holds a commission as rirst lieutenant in
I the Forty-sixth Infantry by virtue of an
appointment by the President.
Lieutenant Thun is not in the American
army for his health. He is there to see
I and to learn, end at the request of hi-
I Government. The position of the Count is
! thai of v military attache, but he Is more
than the ordinary military attache by
virtue of his commission. It was the re
quest of his Government, made through
I the Austrian Minister, that secured his
! appointment, atid it was done on the the
ory that be could learn more if he were
1 actually commissioned as an officer of one
) ot the regiments in the islands than if be
i were merely attached to some general's
' staff and leit to shirt for hlmseli. There
I is a dash of adventure in the scheme as
! well, for there is no real necessity for a
j Government representative to tie nimselt
j down to the discipline of a regiment. But
then if he does not he cannot take part in
any action. It was this phase of the Ques
tion that prompted the Austrian to eeek a
commission.
Lieutenant Thun reported at the Pre
sidio yesterday. He brought with him
j most favorable letters from the adjutant
; general, and also from the Austrian Mln
i ister. He explained his position, showed
' his credentials, and in somewhat broken
i English ; reported for duty ii due form.
] He had Just arrive*! from the East, and
had taken the tirst lodging-house he hap
l*?ned to strike'when he landed from the
j terry. As a consequence he chose a place
not particularly ntted for an Austrian
! aristocrat; in fact, a sailor lodging-house
! down toward the end of Olay street. He
j had no means of providing for himself in
the camp of the casuals, and therefore he
t was allowed to go back to the sailor lodg
i lr.g-houso for the night, but to-day he will
j report again and he will be assigned to
j duty just as the other officers of the army
, have been, with the recruits awaiting
transportation to the Philippines. He will
have to live in a tent with the other cas
ual officers and will have to . -rid his
days in licking raw troops into some kind
of thape fur service in the field. In time,
! and by courtesy it will be made as soon
as possible, he will be assigned to some
) transport and will be ordered to Join his
command in the islands. When he gets
there he will be assigned t<> some com
pany where there Is a vacancy as first
lieutenant, and he will have to fit in and
. do his duty with the other officers.
Another change has been made in the
: palling of the transports, and it Is prcV
I able that none will start until Thursday.
I The Forty-ninth has received orders to
j prepare for embarkation, and two bat
, tailor.* have been ordered to leave on
! Tmirtxiay on the Warren, with the head
: quarters and band. It is hardly probable,
! however, that the command ca:i be got
! ready by that time or that the transport
! can be loaded before that date but at
I any rate the orders are out and the black
I men ar- Jubilant. The Forty-second will
get away to-day if nothing happens to
prevent.
Reports from Angel Island are to the
! effect that there are twelve cases of
â  smallpox now In the hospital over there.
j There are five more at the Presidio, mak
! ing seventeen in all from the Forty-eighth
'. ItÂ»-Kiment.
First Lieutenant Eugene T. Wilson, Rid
I to General ShaftÂ»T, has been ordered to
j proceed to Los Angeles. He left last even-
Ing.
Acting Assistant Surgeon George A.
| Zeller has been assigned to temporary
I duty at the general hospital pending his
assignment to Manila.
Orders directing Chaplain Leslie R.
i Groves to proceed to Manila on the trans
; port Warren have been revoked and he
j has been ordered instead to report for
I temporary duty at the Presidio.
Lieutenant Colonel James M. Marshal,
! deputy quartermaster general in chief of
j the department, ha* been ordered to pro
<â > â¢'1 t<< KÂ«-r: -.>. Nov., to purchase horses fnr
the uso of the army. He will take with
him Captain Frank West; Sixth Cavalry,
Veterinary Surgeon E. J. Creely and John

THE SAN FHANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 08, 1809.
HOW THE TRANSPORTS OF
TO-DAY ARE PROVISIONED
WHEN Uncle Sam had his lit
tie difference with Spain the
greatest difficulty was the get
ting of the men to the seat of
war. Vessels were procured
after some little lay, but the majority
of them were not fitted to carry troops
and the result was much inconvenience
and considerable bad' language from the
soldiers. The carrying of fresh meat
was almost Impossible and the result
was the "embalmed beef" scandal.
That state of affairs has now been
done away with and the Mid on his
voyage to the Philippines fares as well
as he did in barracks and gets the same
allowance of fresh meat. Here is the
requisition of Chief Steward R. Pfeif
fer for fresh provisions for the trans
port Wnrrrn, which sails next Thursday
for Manila with the Forty-eighth reg
iment (colored): CO.ftOO pounds beef, 3500
pounds mutton. 1000 pounds lamb. UK)
pounds turkey. IB dozen chickens. 40
dozen ducks, 40 dozen quail. 1500 pounds
fish, bÂ«-*id*>& KO.CO) dozen eggs, a large
quantity of milk, fresh butter, vegeta
bles and fniit.
All the supplies are put into the freezing chamber? and frozen solid. In the
tropics the meat has to be removed from the freezing chamber before It la
required and thawed out in ar. even â¦emperature. The milk has to be cut out of
the cans in Bolid blocks and thawed out In the kitchen before It can be put into
the pitchers. The vegetables come out a little wilted, but ac good as the lay
they wvre received on board the ship. The carcases of beef and mutton are
frozen m hard a few hours after they have been put in the chamber that when
struck with any hurd substance they ring like an anvil.
Chief Steward Pfe'ffer of the Warren Is an old hand at the business and
one of the most experienced and best liked men on the coaÃt. He was for seven
years chef of the Btate of California, then he was on the Queen, later on the
City of Puebla, leaving that vessel to take charge of the Warrtn.

the captain was a welcome guest, is as
her man possessing a correct knowl

temperament of horses, and absolutely no
i rÂ»<initlals to tell who he is or where he
comes from.
The captain first floated Into San Fran
cisco In 1595. and at once became the run
ning mate of all the real thing* of this
city. He had a delightfully aristocratic
English manner, which, coupled with his
outre style of dress, his perfect knowledge
of how and when a dinner should be
served, a thorough understanding of the
horse .-Â«< he is seen or the English polo
grounds and hunting fields; a fund of en

which Dukes. Earls and Princes of the

CHIEF STEWARD PFEIFFER.
swells who had Just succeeded In getting
onto the way things should be done.
He was admitted to all the clubs, taken
everywhere and became. In fact, the ar
biter elegantarium of social San Fran
cisco. It was learned that he had former
ly been the manager of the St. Louis
Country Club, and he was solicited to take
charge of Burllngame.
He complied, and for a time ran the
whole ranch. Nothing was done without
seeking his advice; nothing was attempted
without the light of his counsel. What
Walnewright eald went, and what Walne
wrl&ht forbade was forever scratched off
the club's books. ~-
The captain saw his opportunity and
made the most of it. His new friends
were worked for whatever they would
stand, and whatever went Into the cap
tain's pockets never again was seen un
less In transit over some bar or across the
counter that shadowed the block of some
bookmaker.
But the captain was a good fellow and
a thoroughbred, and nobody kicked. San
Francisco society wanted real swells, and
when It had one It was willing to pay for
the luxury. But In time other contestants
for social favor drifted In. and the captain
began to lose ground. It was discovered
that he was spending too much time in
gayety and not enough in pursuit of his
duties as manager of the San Mateo Coun
try Club/ and at last a meeting of the dl
rectors waa called and the popular cap
tain was let out.
He at once left the city, and from that
time only the vaguest rumors concerning
him were received until the news of his
present trouble was flashed over the wires
from the north. His present victims are
merchants of Nelson. B. C, and unless he
can make good the losses they have sus
tained through his dishonesty they will
send him where he will be given a harder
Job than teaching the young Idea of a ,
Western metropolis how to shoot and ride. '
While Walnewright has done up dozens
of men In this city he seems to have left
none but friends behind him. He wa.Â« a
good fellow, and the worst of his short
comings while here seems to have been
th* desire to borrow money, which he
would spend as liberally as It was given
him. The members of Burllngame say
that he was let out of his position there
because of lncompetency. and that, not
withstanding reports to the contrary, he
never Indulged in any crookedness In the
handling of the club's funds and accounts.
Though Wainewright passed a number of
worthless checks, the one on which he
was prosecuted was for $5, which he
worked on Thomno Lillie of the firm of
Llllle Bros, of Nelson. p. C.
The brother of the prisoner was present
and did everything he could to save him.
The Judge, however, said that an ex
ample had to be made of some one, as the
practice of passing worthless paper had
become altogether too common among re
mittance men. and the lesson would do
a great deal of good to the whole frater
nity.
The captain therefore has the satisfac
tion of knowing that he Is setting an ex
ample even while In durance vile.

OF REQUISITION
Guard Blouse Awards
Discussed.
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S VIEWS
A NEW POINT RAISED AS TO
THE BOARD.
While Two Members May Execute a
Contract, Unanimity Is Con
sidered More De
sirable.
Attorney General Ford has rendered the
opinion referred to In Sunday's Call as j
to the power of the uniform board of the
Katteoal Guard of California to award
contract*. The opinion was forwarded to
the Adjutant General's office in Sacra
mento last Saturday afternoon.
The conclusions of the Attorney Gen
eral are that the power of the board is
set forth in section 3027 of the Political
Code, wherein it Is provided among other
things that "the service uniform and
equipments shall be furnished, as afore
said, by a board which is hereby provided,
to conelst of three commissioned officers,
to be appointed by the commander-ln
chief." This board Is directed "to pur
chase the cloth, arrange for Its cutting
and also for Its making, when required
by the commander of any organisation,
and also to purchase equipments. " The
same section further provides that "the
bills of Bald board shall be audited, al
lowed and paid as are other military de-
I mands."
With reference to the above the fol
lowing questions were submitted to the
Attorney General:
Firstâ What is the standing of thÂ»
board as to bidders whose bids have
been accepted for uniforms and which
bids were submitted in response to
advertisements for and on behalf of
the board?
Secondâ Who should sign contractsâ
the board by Its president and its re
corder or the entire board?
In response to the first question, the
Attorney General holds that the aocfpt
ance by the board of the bid of a bidder
In retponse to public notice soliciting
such bids and the acceptance of such bid
by the board and the notification of the
bidder of such acceptance, completed and
created a contract, and that said contract
was binding upon the board subject to
the provision* above rererred to with ref
erence to the auditing, allowance and pay
ment of the Mils therefor by the State
Board of Military Auditors.
In response to the second question, the
Attorney General cited section 15 of the
Political Code, which reads as follows:
Words giving a Joint authority to
three or more public officers, or other
persons, are construed as (riving such
authority to a majority or them, un
less It is otherwise expressed in the
act Riving the authority.
After thus quoting from the law. the
Attorney General held that In a proper
case all contracts for or on behalf of said
board should bo signed by every member
of the board, although a majority thereof
would be authorized to act.
In view of this it is probable that the
board, or more properly the majority â
Colonel Cutler and lieutenant Colonel
Glestlngâ will sign the two contracts for
blouses, awarded to the Pettlbcne Com
pany and to Mandel. Pursch & Co.. the
latter receiving by the vote of these two
.members of the board 38 cents more per
blouse than Pettibone & Co., or In all. on
the amount of the contract, the rum of
1770.
The law quoted by the Attorney Gen
eral Is that of IMS, and from its reading
it is clear that "this board Is authorized
and directed to purchase the cloth, ar
range for its cutting and also for Its mak
ing when required by the commander of
any organization." Now a new question
arises, and that Is. Did not the uniform
board In letting the contracts, not only for
the blouses, but for the cans, ' trousers
and overcoats, exceed Its autnorltv? For
It Is a fact that no commanding oTflcer of
any of the organizations, say the Second
Brigade, for instance, has made any re
quisition for uniforms. The First Regi
ment certainly did not. for it was not a
part of the National Guard when the con
tracts were let. and Is not yet, as the
muster rolls have not as yet been for
warded to superior headquarters. If any
one on behalf of the Fifth Regiment has
filed a requisition, no one In authority
knows of it. Consequently the board of
Its own volition has let contracts for more
than $40,000 without any requisition hayÂ»
ing been made for the same.

VI. HANS HOLBEIN.
BY ARTHUR LINCOLN FROTHING-
HAM JR.. PH.D.
Durer, Holbein and Rembrandt are the
three greatest representatives of renais
sance art In Germany, and. while Durer's
Cental Is more imaginative and Rem
brandt's more commanding and personal.
Holbein excels Durer as a colorlst and
composer, can be more altruistic ihon
Rembrandt and occupies a broader posi
tion than either as a link between the art
of Italy and the north during the renais
sance.
Holbein was the only German painter
who absorbed both the early and the
golden renaissance of Italy, tempering
with ita grace and beauty the realism and
dramatic restlessness of Germany. His
career began as the first wave of the
renaissance penetrated his native land,
and as the fervor of Protestant reform
HANS HOLBEIN.
was lending a new though temporary
vigor to religious art. Holbein was as
great an exponent of the second as of the
first of these national movements.
The Imperial city of Augsburg, where
Hans Holbein was born In 1497, was the
principal center of the early renaissance
In Germany. It had long possessed a fa
mous school of painting. Holbein's
father, uncle and brothers were all paint
ers, and he grew up in his father' work
shop practicing painting from his ear
liest boyhood. He remained In Augsburg
until 1516. and the city still preserves a
number of his boyish works, which tes
tify to great precocity. In 1512 he painted
Borne One panels for the convent of St.
Catherine; in 1515 the votive picture of
the Schwartz family, and in 1515 the great
triptych of the "Martyrdom of St. Sebas
tian," where the figure of St. Elizabeth
Is one of the most beautiful hitherto pro
duced by German art. Numerous sketches
for portraits remain at Augsburg show-
Ing how early the boy tended toward his
great specialty and how soon he acquired
surety of touch and characterization.
In 1516, at the age of 1?, he went to
Switzerland, settling at Basel as an In
dependent painter. He remained there ten
yt-ars, and during this time attained to
the full maturity of his talents. He then
executed religious pictures for the
churchesâ a branch which he afterward
entirely abandoned. The "Virgin and
Child,' at Solothurn, in 1522, with its
broad, heavy figures, was followed by
that world-renowned picture, the "Ma
donna of the Burgomaster Meyer Fam
ily. of which the original is in Darmstadt
and the better-known early copy in Dres
den. It is a marvelous example of high
finish and splendid coloring and affects
one like peals of a grand organ.
In his early series of passion pictures
Holbein treated a poignant theme often
attempted by German artists and one In
which they loved to revel in theatrical
and hideous realism. Holbein succeeded
In tempering this with some of the Ita'inn
grace and repose. The Catholic churches
of Switzerland. *o soon to be desecrated,
were decorated at this time with a num
ber of ills religious paintings. He en
tered also the field of classical allegory
In a series of frescoes In the hall of the
Town Council.
Still, even from the beginning of his
life In Basel, he put the most of hit
heart Into his portraits. The** 1 of Jacob
Meier and his wife 0516) arc soft and
harmonious, with transparent brown col
oring. Inaugurating a style that culmin
ates in the superb head of his friend, Bon-
Ifaclus Amerbach, which has more pure
beauty than any of the portraits of his
later English peridd.
During the last years of his Basel life
(1523-26) Holbein devoted himself almost
exclusively to drawing* for wood cuts,
of which over 300 are known, besides
some twenty alphabets. They Illustrated
both Old and New Testaments and miscel
laneous writings. The series of the
"Dance of Death" carried his reputation
everywhere. Holbein may have been re
duced to this work by the slight patron
age given him by the city, which finally
drove him to England. At the same lime
he always showed a marked love for the
decorative and minor arts, well i.lustrat
ed by the collections of his drawings.
It la evident that Leonardo da vinci and
the Milanese school influenced Holbein
In Basel; be was even more strongly
swayed by the great Paduan ManteKiin.
whose engravings formed his drawing
and whose dramatic power clothed In
classic grace and mastery of perspective
In architecture appealed to him so lor
clbly that entire figures and groups are
appropriated In Holbein's larger composi
tions, beginning with his passion pic
tures (Basel) of 1519 and ending in his
'â¢Triumph of Riches" and "Triumph of
Poverty" in London. The Inherent Ger
man realism often continued, however, to
pierce through In this Basel period In
ways often exaggerated, theatrical or re
pulsive. Such were the heads of the
mustachioed Adam and an Eve. plain
studies from ungraceful models; such was
the single figure of the dead Christ, so
startlngly corpsellke in its unsparing real-
Ism; such were many tragic and comic
details In his passion scenes and other
series. Holbein showed then a very
strong element of comedy and satire,
which he vented especially In his small
drawings for Illustrations. â
It is seldom that so little Is known of
the private, life of an eminent artist. The
vague reports circulated long after, his
death that he was of lax morality and a
wlneblbber are hardly tenable In view of
the friendships of such men as the great
Erasmus, the pure-minded Amerbach and
the moral paladin Sir Thomas More. It
is true that his marriage to a widow ap
pears not to have been a success: he did
not take his wife and children to England
and therefore was separated from them
for nearly all the latter part of his life
It was the friendship of Erasmus for
Holbein that enabled the painter to go
to England in 152*3 with good hopes of find
ing there the field denied him In Basel
Holbein's known output during the three
years (1527-29) of this 1 first English resi
dence was entirely portraits. Beginning
with Sir Thomas More himself, to whom
Erasmus had recommended him and
prominent men of More's circle, such as
Archbishop Warham, Bishop Fisher and
Sir Henry Guilford, he passed, as his rer>
utatlon grew, to a wider circle. All his
portraits of these years have a force and
realism unusually penetratingâ even for
Holbeinâ notwithstanding -thÂ«ir hardness
as compared with his. previous work at
Basel. There Is almost no mannerism In
his portraits, no obvious intervention of
the artiste personality, as there Is in such
other great portraitists as Rembrandt and
Van Dyke. While at times Holbein nay
seem wanting In the Imaginative realizing
of character, his powers of observation,
which served him with such unerring ac
curacy even In the minutest details, re
produce also the whole of the Individual
me also the whole â â¢'
In a way that Is perfectly convincing. Tho
delicate lines of the sketches for his por
traits are always clear and firm and show
no retouches; on these quick sketches,
with occasional color notes, aided by his
wonderful memory, he relied almost en
tirely in making the finished portraits.
and did not burden his subjects with
many sittings. A study of his numerous
drawings at Windsor and Basel is Indis
pensable.
When Holbein returned to Basel In IZ2H
he found that the most disorderly ele
ment! of the Reformation had triumphed.
The churches for which he had worked
had been sacked and the paintingsâ hi*
among themâ destroyed. The reformers
themselves had forbidden religious art.
Holbein found no public commissions

From 1532 to 1536 he painted a irumber of
portraits of these worthies. Perhaps with,
a view of catering to their vanity and na
tional love of homely detail, he often In
troduced accessories that mar the sim
plicity of these portraits, though they or.
done with the care of the best painters of
still life. The most notable for coloring,
finish and character Is the half-tlgure of

the greatest work of this period of hi*
life, though almost rivaled ny the "Two
majors' (1533) In the National Gal
lery.
Lvery year added to the painter's repu
tation. Perhaps the portrait of Sir Rich
ard Southwell In l.'.V opened the way to
hi* appointment In 1537 as court painter.
This year marks an epoch In his life;
he painted In the palace at Whitehall thu
monumental portrait picture, with tho
full-length figures of Henry VIII and hi*
wife. Jane Seymour, his father. Henry
VII. and his mother Elisabeth. The por
trait of Henry VIII In this picture Â» â¢<
the starting point of most of the King' a
later portraits. Some Idea of its execu
tion can be gained from the contempo
rary portrait by him of the King's gold
smith, "Hubert Morett" (Dresden), hi.i
greatest existing work for these years.
Shortly after the painter was sent by
the King to Brussels to make a portrait
of the Duchess of Milan. whom h->
thought of marrying. The existing full
length of the Duchess (Norfolk collection*
Is one of the simplest, most direct and
sympathetic of all his works.
Holbein became the portrayer In suc
cession of Henry's various Queens and
their children, as well as of the grrnt
lords and ladles of the court. The esti
mation In which he was held may bo
gauged by the anecdote of his throwing
a nobleman downstair*â whereat the King
declared that he could any day mako
seven earls out of seven peasants, but
out of seven earls he could not make onÂ»
Holbein. The painter must have also
been court decorator and architectural
designer, director of fetes and procession*,
planner of the royal costumes, ornament*,
arms and furniture, and he himself be
came a miniaturist He thus not only
assisted materially In the development of
English Industrial and minor arts but ho
Introduced and popularized In England
the art of the' pure Italian renaissance In
all Its forms, even In architecture and
monumental ornament.
There was something extremely virile In
Holbein's talent. He was a painter oÂ£
men. not as seen by a poet and Idealized,
not as transformed by the painter's me
dium, but as analyzed by a Keen-grasp
ing Intellect. Though he and Durer wero
the two nrtlst* who most assisted by their
Illustrative designs In the great attempt
of the Protestant reform to m.ike known
the Bible to the people throughout Europe,
and though their powerful Illustration*

stood, like his friend Erasmus, on neutral
ground. Still he must be regarded, when
we reckon up his life work, as a great re
former. If only for the penitential effect
of the caustic and terrorizing pictures of
his "Dance of Death."
His life closed at the asre of 47. during
the London plague of 1543. His posthu
mous reputation was such as to lead t->
the attribution to him In England of many
contemporary portraits.

'
End of the Famous Litigation
That Promised So Much :
An Arbitrator Is Appointed and the Lady
Secures a Portion of Her
Claim.
Oakland Offlc* San Francisco Call, i
â¢Â« Broadway. Nov V
W.i.iam J. Dtncee ar.d Mrs. Jane K.
Bather have settled their differences and
Â».th.n the next few days dismissals will
be fl.ed of the very sensational litigation
t-at <-ach has brought against the oth#r. ;
T...s .legation was the most startling!
t..at is now pending In the Alarm-da j
county courts, for it consisted cf a suit'
for niT.OM -which Mrs. Sather brought
against Mr. Dlngee. who was her ftr.an- I
c'.al agcr.t for many years, and a retaMa- |
tcry suit brought by Mr. Dlngee against |
Mrs. Sather for MOO.OW damages for slan- !
cer. It was not alone the amounts n- |
volved in the suits that made them of
Interest, but It was the possibility? of !
revelations that might be made upon both
tides. An! so the public of Oakland has j
bt^n watching with I ated br* ath for the |
trial of tnei two suits and expectations I
ran high to what might rent.
But these expectations have all l-**n '
dashed to the ground, for the two fair.oj* '
t-ulu have been submitted to arbitration. !
a decision haÂ» been reached and the suits i
uill both be dismissed before the pres- I
er.t week ends.
The compromise was mad* during the j
past week, but everybody connected with j
It has been r>-ge(i to Â«errÂ»-cy until the ;
fi'ir.g of the dismissa's :â¢ "s the story off
thr settlement. The public has already i
been too much Interested In the case ar.d !
there In no Intention of taking them into !
the confldeaces cf the two litigants more ,
than iÂ» T.eeessary. However, it Is auri.d
that both suits shall be dismissed, and !
Mrs. Sather sets a portion of her claim i
upon Mr. Dlr.cee. though nothing like tne
amount *uÂ«d for. Tr.Â«* amount of the
compromise is *bou: 110.000.
Not the least interesting fact In connec
tion with the compromise of those famous
eases was the selection of the arbitrator.
It was agreed between A. A. Moore and
John A. Sanborn. representing Mrs.
bather, and Htf d & Nusbauaer. repr*- j
t-entir.g William J. Dingee. that but one ;
arbitrator should b* chosen, and each side !
selected Frunk J. Moffltt. Mr. Moffltt was
at one time the confidential agent of Wll
..ain J. Dlr.gee, and when the two sep
arated about a year ago it was thought
that thf y would never come together :
again in any business way. That Mrs.
Sather should accept Mr. Moffltt was not i
surprising, but that Mr. DlngeÂ» should
take his former agent after their differ
ences added one more feature to this ;
series of remarkable cases. Both sides I
have acceded the decision of the arbi
trator.
The litigation between Mrs. Sather and '
Vk illlam J. Dlngee began about a year |
at ... when Mrs. Sather severed her rela- \
tlcns with her agent and announced her j

OAKLAND HEARS HOW
LOS ANGELES DID IT
OAKLAND. Nov. 27.-Ex-Senator Dargie Is anxious that Oakland KhaJl
have a postofflce a? soon as possible, and in order to settle if possl .
blÂ« the difficulty now existing over the acquiring of a alt* by the
Government, he sent out a few queries to other coast cities where
postofflces have already been built by the Federal Government ask
lr.R for the pricei that were paid. The editor of the Los Angeles Re
cord sent a reply that read like a Joke. He said:

rtfltor Tribuneâ The Main-street property-owner* deeded the Poeteffiee site to the
Goverrirner.t for on* dollar. THE RECORD.
Some months ago the Fuggestion was made that the city of Oakland do
nate, a site to the Government, so that all the appropriation could be ex
pended on the building, but this idea waa not favored. It was said that
the amount appropriated. $230,000, was ample to procure both site and build-
In*, and that there was no necessity for the city to assist the Govern
ment- The. news from Lcs Angeles was a big surprise to Oakland, who
were not aware that Uncle Sam cot a site In the southern city so cheaply
ThÂ» Board of Trade is now busy. trylr.*; to find a site that will come
within the fljrure proposed by the Government agent, which Is about 150.000.
So far they have found three pieces of property near this figure. These
properties are located at Fifteenth and Franklin streets and at Seventeenth
Â«r.Â«t and New Broadway.
by her upon many Olffen lit real estate
transactions. The first move was made
when Mrs. S.ither brought suit against
Joseph F. Evans for a lot of her accounts
with Dingee. Kvans had been at one time
employed as her attorney, and in that
capacity he hnd been given a lot of her
evidence In the proposed suit. Then Mr
Evans was selected as a special treasury
ag^nt to cvÂ» to Manila ann establish the
I'nited States customs service in that city.
and was rcm^eiied to withdraw from the
proposed suit of Mrs. Sither. In some
mysterious manner the documents upon
which Mrs. Sather bnsed her claim
against Mr. Dingee disappeared, and she
first broueht v suit against Evans to re
cover the papers.
Mr. Evans 1 deposition was taken by Mrs.
Sather's attorneys in San Francisco, and
luring the progress of this legal move the
missing r.Â»r <i r' 5 w-*Â»re suddenly found. Then
Mrs. Sather kept her promise of bringing
svi.t against Mr. Dlngee. and an action
for Sli7.(Â«*!i was begun.
This set the tongues of gossips going
In Oakland, and the possibilities of the
revelations were discussed by those who
wondered at the amount claimed. The
â ult was considered of so much Import
ance that the mere fact that it was con
tinued was deemed sufHclent for a news
paper story.
While the litigation was pending Mr
D'.ng^e made his trio to Europe, and It
was whimpered that he did not desire to
have his deposition taken. Then the suit
..f Mr. Dinsee against Mrs. Sather was
N>pur.. and Mrs. Sather made a trip to
Oregon, and it was even said that she
did not desire to be served with the sum
mons in the new suit.
Hut Mr. Dlngee returned some weeks
aeo in order to settle the loss caused by
the burning of his famous country home
at Piedmont. The attorneys for Mrs .
Sather did not hesitate, and for two
weeks his deposition has been taken in
<h*> offices of Reed & XuÂ«haumer before
Notary Pi:bi!e Phil M. Walsh.
This deposition wns finished last week,
and then the compromise bÂ«gan. Mrs
Sather has returned from Orejcon and has
not yÂ«>t been served with the papers in
the suit against her for slander, though
she has taken a prominent part In the
work of the Ebell Society In connection
with the library site.
The parties in the litigation have no de
sire to confirm the story and they cannot
deny it. Mrs. Jane K. Sather declined to
he se^n. and A. A. Moore, her attorney
would only Â«ay that the suit brought by
Mrs. Sather against Mr. Dingee was set
for trial for to-morrow, and would be
continued for one week. He also ...

GAS CONTRACT
POSTPONED FOR
ANOTHER WEEK
Vexed Question Stiil
Unsettled.
The differences that have existed re
tween the Supervisors and the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company came
near being .settled at the meeting yes
terday, and the signing of contracts
seemed Imminent, but the pas company
Insisted on having the contract date from
December 1. to run for one year. The
Mayor stated that the charter expressly
provides that the Incoming Supervisors
shall fix the rates to go into effect from
July 1. 1900, and they must meet for that
purpose in February next, and conse
quently the matter of the gas contract
was postponed for another week.
President Crockett of the gas company
addressed the board and said that the
compromise rate of IOVj cents for each g4sÂ«
lamp was accepted by his board of direct
ors, with the understanding that the con
tract was to run one year â¢â¢â¢â .â 
of s'gnirg. The company would be re
quired to take up 1M nas lamps and erect
seventy-three electric masts, the cost of
which " would amount to *10.<Â»0, and he
could not sign a contract dating from De
cember 1. UtfOi without permission from
his directors.
The expense of public lighting under the
bids submitted by the pa? company ex
ceeded the appropriation, but the corpora
tion has never admitted the stand tak-n
by Mayor l'helan that the price of gas
lamps "should be 10 cents a night. The
company has all alone demanded 11 cents.
The Mayor's veto of resolutions author
izing the" full payment of the bll - for
waier supply in public buildings, squares.

olutions. On the bills for part of August

resolutions, but the Mayor's veto was sus
tained in this instance also.
The order providing for the holding of
bond elections in December was finally
parsed; also the order regulating the cre
mation of deceased persons.
The Mayor withdrew his veto of resolu
tions authorizing the extra work on the
Bosworth-street tunnel. He stated that
he had investigated the matter and found
that the work, most of which has neon
performed, irai warranted by the existing
circumstances. He presented vetoes of
the order regulating the use of gas grates
and prohibiting the use of gasoline: also
a veto on the resolutions accepting Bu
chanan street, between Filbert and Union,
because the street Is already broken from
a cave in the sewer. The vetoes were re
ferred to the proper committees. The res
olution forbidding the manufacture of
liquefied acetylene and regulating the
making of calcium carbide was. on the
request of protestants. referred to the
FirV Committee for consideration.
The resolution changing the grade at
Twenty-first and Sanchez .... con
form with that established in IS 66 was in
deflnitelv postponed on motion of Super
visor Phelps. Horace G. Plan made a
forcible plea on behalf of the interested
property owners, who. be said, had been
put to a great deal of expense in comply-
Ing with the grade as established in I^-SS.
He contended that it would be a practical
confiscation of the surrounding property
if the grade of 1^66 were re-established.
Supervisor Aigeltlneer objected to the in
definite postponement of the resolution.
but the motion prevailed and seemed to
please a large contingent of ladies present
who own homesteads in the vicinity of the
proposed change of grade.
The resolutions abandoning the use of
ICO hydrants, as recommended by the Gas
and Water Inspector, were adopted.
The Mayor's veto of the resolutions ap
pointing Alfred Fuhrmann special attor
ney for the collection of delinquent per
sonal property taxes was sustained by a
unanimous vote. The Mayor stated that
the new charter provides for the appoint
ment of such an attorney by the Tax Col
lector.
Rateman Brothers were granted another
extension of two weeks from November 2Â«
on the* Hall of Justice contract. The May
or stated that he was decidedly opposed to
any further extension and that the build
ing should certainly be read" for occu
pancy by the middle of December.

Police Clerk Kelly, charged with crimin

anxious to testify against the accused:
that he was not aware that his presence
was wanted and that he left the city on
urgent business. Judge Lawlor. however,
ordered him Into the custody of the Sher

California.
"The Sporting Duchess" at th*Â» Califor
nia Theater Is doing herself proud by the
way she tills the house and the applause
she calls forth by the excellence of her
noting. Last night there was not a seat
to be had for love or money after the
curtain rung up on the first act. and from
then to the finish there was a continual
stream of ptople dropping in. well con
tent to stand In the allies and at thÂ«Â»
back of the house, or. In fact, any old
place where they could get a glimpse of
the horse race, which is about as realis
tic a bit of work as has ever been prt-
Bented to our local theatergoers.
"The Spirting Du<-hÂ»Â«s<' will run but
one wtfk. after which the Frawley Com
{â any will put on "An Enemy to th-
King." This latter play is one of the best
in The t-ntlre Frawley repertoire and
should make a hit with thÂ«>sÂ»- who know
a good thing wh*n they see it.
Columbia.
There have been many productions of
Bronson Howard's "Shenandoah." but
never so dramatic and complete a one as
that presented to the San hrancisco pub
lic at the Columbia last night. The stir
ring scenes ot battle were portrayed with
a realism that was heard five blocks
away, and the powder smoke was so
thick that It drew tears from the eyes of
the hardest hearted. But it was not all
smoke. There was artistic effect and
dramatic action In the play. Infantry
men firing upon the enemy with breech
loading Springfield rifles and cavalrymen
mounted on fine horses dashed across the
stage, riders after being shot falling out
of the Baddle headlong to the floor with
splendid dramatic effect, were the thrill
ing realisms of the third act. And when
the Union men were sore pressed and
forced back inch by inch and Phil Sheri
dan on his black charger galloped across
the sta-;e with Old Glory waving behind
him. the house stood upon its feet and
gave him cheer aft-r chÂ»er.
"Shenandoah" will remain with us for
two weeks, and It ls safe to predict hat it
will be greeted by overflowing house* dur
ing the whole period, as it was last night.
Tivoli.
There in still some charm left In "Thf
Hoolah." which received its revival at the
Tlvoli last evening. The catchy melodic,
pretty dane**s and funny situation-? hold
the interest of the audience. TIM event
at the Tlvoli last evening was the first
appearance of Eloise Mortimer, th? new
soubrette. She ls â  vocalist of consider- !
able talent. Her voice la strong and pen*-- j
tratlng and her taste of execution nnrk.t
her thorough experience. She If a m .-:
desirable acquisition to the Tivoli cast,
and will no doubt make many Wends era
this season Is over.
Ada Palmer Walker did some of her best
work as Namouna and Tom Greene jrinsj
the role of Prince Tarbld with that
smoothness which 1- a second nature to
an experienced professional singer. Hut
after having heard Ferris Hartman In thÂ«
part of the Hoolah Phil Branson ij. In
deed, a sad spectacle. Let in paÂ« this
over. Another misfit in this cast Is Arthur
Messmer. whose facial contortions are ex
cruciatingly painful and whose oocuslonul
warbles can only be fitfully compared
with the yelping of seals. There are so
many better voices In the Tlvoli chorus
that It is not necessary to give Me?smcr a
prominent part. He may have sen J>ctter
day?, but that i<Â» quite a little wh'lo ajtO.
This evening will be another gala night
with "The Marked Ball." This great work
Is without doubt the triumph of the pres
ent grand opera season. Both H.iius -;i
and Avedano have an excellent opportu
nity to be at their very best and the en
thusiasm of the audience will know nÂ»>
bounds. The house is almost sold out
for tne balance of the week, as this forms
the farewell performances of the two
great operatic stars.
ALFRED METZGEH.
Grand Opera-House.
The second week of the extravaganza.
"Evangellne." opened auspiciously at the

was the reappearance, of Thomas H.

GOOD BEER NOT
MADE FROM CORN
Thus Declares Brewer
Busch.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON*. Nov. r.-Adolphus
Busch of the AnheuÂ«er-Busch Brewing
Com; of St. Louis to-day took a posi
tion before the Senate Committee on Man
ufactures antagonistic to that taken by
many other brewers who have testified
before the committee. He appeared be
fore the committee In connection with Its
Investigation of food adulterations and. In
reply to questions from Senators Mason
and Harris, said that the best beer could
be raatfe only of barley malt, hops and
water; that while corn might bÂ« used for
ordinary beer, the best article could not
be made from It. He contended that a
proper process of aging was the only
proper preservative of beer and that bo
racfc and salicylic adds were injurious
and deleterious to health. He recom
mended a law axlnp a minimum of malt
extract and other materials entering into
the production of beer.
At the afternoon session of the com
mittee the testimony of a number of
American champigne-makers was heard.
They were: \V. E. Hildreth. president of
the Vrbar.a Wine Company; E. R. Emer
son, president of the Brotherhood Wine
Company; D. G. Cook, president of the
American Wine Company; D. B. Auder.
president of the Pleasant Valley Wlae
Company, and C. G. Wheeler, president of
the Lake Keuka Wine Company.
Their testimony was directed toward
showing the superiority of American
wine* over the foreign, and they con
demned In unmeasured terms the practice
of sending abroad cheap, adulterated
wines from this country and bringing
them back decorated with foreign lab<??Â».
They favored legislation making It a
felony to counterfeit labels and trade
marks and urged prohibition of importa
tion of American wines which have been
sent abroad and returned adulterated.
They asserted that 60 per cent ofthe Im
ported still wines and a large percentage
of the champagne* were doctored"
American wlniÂ»s.

The coasting steamers are beginning to
keep the "wind Jammers" company. All
of them are making very lons passages.
but none are so Ions: overdue as to cause
any uneasiness. ThÂ« Portland Is bar
bound at Astoria, the Empire and Homer
are barbound at Eureka, while the Till.i
mook, after buttling with the southeaster
fur twenty-four hours, ran buck to port.
The TUiamook, North Fork, Wee ott, La
g-ui.u and Samoa all sailed for Eureka for
San Francisco last Saturday. The Samoa
passed out early in the morning and
reached this port yesterday. The Tilla
mook. North Fork and Weeott passed out
together, and while the former put back
into port again the others continued to
"buck" the Kale and are coming along
slowly to San Francisco. The collier Pro
greso, from Tacoma, was also looked for
on Sunday, but she was 116 hours coming
down on her last trip, bo she may not
bo looked for until early to-day.
Of the overdue "wind Jammers" not a
word has been heard. If the steamers
cannot make headway against the Kale.
what chance has a sailing vessel?
They will all come along as soon as there
is a change of wind, however, and not one
of the licet but will have a hard luck tale
to telL
One of the biKgest changes ever seen in
towboat circles took place yesterday.
Captain Clem Randall of the tug Relief
has taken command of the Oregon Rail
road and Navigation Company's steamer
<;â¢-.. w. Elder. The vessel has bean in
use as a transport and a few days ago
was turned over to her owners. She will
now be put on the run between San Fran
cisco and the Columbia River. Captain
Randall Is one of the best liked and most
capable men In the towboat service on th*Â»
coast, and his many friends Will be glnd
to hear of hts promotion to an ocean go
ing steamer.
The chances are that Captain Harry
Marshall of the Fearless will take Cap
tain Randall's place on the Relief, and
Captain John Bilovich will take the Fear
less. Captain "Joe" Trewen, who was
I been acting us mate of the Relief. *-ill
again go as master of the Alert, taking
Captain Sllovlch's place.
The transports Columbia and Dalny

bia will carry the headquarter! and band
and five companies, the other seven com
panies going on thÂ« Dalny Vostok. As
soon as these --.-Is sail the Sherman
will come In from the stream and will
be got away again about next Wednes
day week. The Warren goes out on
Thursday with the Forty-ninth Regiment,
probably on hor last voyage as a troop
ship. On her return from Manila she
maÂ» be turned Into a freight transport.
With the tirst of the year there will be
ten Government transports In the Ban

; vessels will then be released. The Mend,
Logan, Thomas and two others are now
on their way from the Bast to Manila
and will thtMi come on herÂ«. One of these

Captain G'-neraux, formerly mate of the

A mix-up followed, which ended In
Schmidt being knocked out. It took three

j he was not In a condition to continue his
examination.
Two hoodlums named Frank King and

party on a Mission street car Sunday
night. There were three gentlemen and
a lady and Officer Callahan of the harbor

an employe of Wells. Fargo & Co.'s Bank,

When the bank opened yesterday morning

sacks of money supposed to contain $10,000
each were delivered to him and imme

office. The taxes were paid with demands
held by the company against the city for
a little over $40,000 and the four sacks of
coin supposed to contain $40,000 and a re

Treasurer's oftlce immediately and there
the mistake was discovered and restitu

Goh' Cotillon the Latest
Fad of Upper-Tendum.
SOCIETY is grilnÃ to have a "hoot

novel nfTair Were all arrang.-d to-
day. The ten patronesses prepared
the list of Ii vltations. decided upon the
cotillon leader and chose the hall for tne
golf party. The ladies who will act M
patronesses are Mrs. Southard Hoffman,
Mrs. Pelham Amos, Mrs. K. F Pn
Mrs. Josslyn, Mrs. Morgan. Mrs. McCu
then, Mrs. Samuel Knight. Mrs. Murpny,
Mrs. Kittle and Mlfs Hager.
December -.". from 3 until 7 In the after
noon. Is the time set for the affair. It will
bÂ« held at Cotillon Mull and the two hun
dred and fifty invitations insist upon nm
tumes.
F. M. f'ire.-nway will lead the cotillon
Clad like a kilted Highlander The se
lection of Mr. Oreenway for leader prac

cles. Several of the "cub" leaders, who
are always in training waiting for the
mantle of their superior to fail upoi
bad .hen shed hopes that this mtair
would rlr.K tho death knÂ»-ll of the king;
but Mr. Ctreeuway Is evidently .-till Rex.
(fe one In particular pleads guilty of
originating the idea of a goif party. It
"just gTOWed" at an afternoon tea. The
ladles :iU agr^^l that it would be great
fun and to their surprise found that tne
men did not need coaxing.
It Is to be strictly a "golf" party nnd
therefore will be held In the afternoon.
The ladles will wear golf boots, snort
skirts, pink jackets and golf cap*. The
men will be clad as Bonnie Prince Char
lie in ail his plaidnd glory was not. It
may take nine tailors to make a nun,
but a "hoot mon" in knickerbockers and
pink coat requires a dozen. Tlnk," by
way of explanation, Is the correct tÂ»rm
for tho mil Jacket, though it looks "scar
let" to ;h<>s<e uninitiated in the argot of

This is society's mnlden venture in the
Une of fre.ik affairs. New York has had
Its '"children's" parties, where adults
acted like 10-year-o!ds. Its "paper" balls
