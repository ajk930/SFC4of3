DESPERATE BATTLE IN SOUTH AFRICA.
FILIPINOS SURRENDER TO AMERICANS
BRITISH RELIEF FORCE
AGAIN ENGAGES BOERS
Sanguinary Combat Waged for Hours
on the Hills Near Belmont.
I ONDON. Nov.2s.â This afternoon the War Office posted the following dispatcn, dated Cape
Town. 12:25 p. m. to-day, from General Forester-Walker:
*- â¢"Lord Methuen reports that he moved yesterday (Saturday) at 3:30 a. m., with the Ninth
brigade, the mounted corps, the naval brigade and two batteries, the guards following with the
baggage. Near Gras Pan (about ten miles north of Belmont. on the railway line to Kimberiey)
2500 Boers, with six guns and two machine guns, opposed him.
"The action began at Ga. m. Our batteries fired shrapnel very accurately until the heights
seemed clear. Then the naval brigade and infantry advanced to the assault. The firing was des
perate until 10 a. m.. when the heights were carried.
"The Boers retreated on the line where the Ninth Lancers were placed to intercept them.
The result was not known at the time of telegraphing. The artillery took immediate advantage
of the enemy's retirement.
"Early in the action 500 Boers attacked our rear guard. The brigade met this and also pro
tected the flanks. The naval brigade acted with the greatest gallantry and suffered heavily, but
no particulars are yet known.
"The enemy showed the greatest stubbornness and must have suffered greatly. Twenty
were buried. It is known that thirty-one were killed and forty-eight wounded. More than fifty
horses were found dead in one place. One battery fired five hundred rounds.
"Our force must halt one day at Gras Pan to rest and replenish ammunition. The force
worked splendidly and is prepared to overcome many difficulties. The naval brigade, the Royal Ma
rines, the light infantry and the first battalion of the North Lancashire regiment especially dis
tinguished themselves.
"Regarding Thursday's fight: Eighty Boers killed are accounted for. Sixty-four wagons
were burned. A large quantity of powder. 50.000 rounds of ammunition and 750 shells were
blown up. Commandant Aibrecht. Chief of the Orange Free State Artillery, commanded the Boer
artillery. Genera! Roeway was in chief command."
Ll ;.o fur-
I ther news respecting Ix>rd lleth-
I uen*s advance has been received.
I a and the absence of official details
regarding his losses creates. ..the
greatest suspense, and especially rlnc*
the publication of the heavy sacri
fice* endured by the naval brigade. No
alarm, however. Is felt as to his position
despite- the evidence that the Boers in
tend to contest evÂ»-ry foot of the way. It
vnujkeewn that, in the absence of suf
ficient cavalry, he would be compelled to
advance slowly, and he has a preference
for niKbt or early dawn attack*, which
events *eem to have Justified, the Bsers
b*lnÂ« decidedly averse to darkness for
their operation*.
The fact that In the Gras 1 an action
mr !?r!tifh battery f.red s">o rounds proves
the desperate nature of the fight, and
there if little doubt that the casualties
were heavy. It Js now known that no
puns wÂ«-re captured in the llelmont en
racrment.
Meanwhile the news from Natal is dis
tinctly more hopeful from the HrltiÂ«h
point of view. The details are rather
vajfue. but It seems certain that the IJ<>ers
ore retiring, that railway communication
JÂ« I ( ir.ir reopened and that the British re
lief forces arÂ«- J.iinlnr hands. Thi?. taken

ZAMBOANGA YIELDS
TO COMMANDER VERY
Leading Chiefs of Mindanao Island
Have Declared Fealty.
WASHINGTON, Xov. 26. â The Secretary of the Xavv to-day received a telegram from Ad
miral Watson, stating that the entire province of Zamboanga, Island of Mindanao, surren
dered to Commander Very of the Castine, unconditionally, on November iS. The deliv
ery of all guns is promised. Local chiefs have declared themselves loyal. Admiral Watson's dis
patch follows:
CAVITE, Nov. 26. 1899.â Secretary Navy, Washington: November 18 entire province Zam
boanga surrendered to Very unconditionally. Delivery of all guns promised. Numerous local
chiefs have declared loyalty. WATSON*
The information contained in Admiral Watson's dispatch was received by the President and
his advisers with unconcealed satisfaction. The surrender of the province of Zamboanga is re
garded as the beginning of the end of the revolution in the island of Mindanao, and, it is believed,
will be a hard blow to those who are still endeavoring to maintain the insurrection in the island
of Luzon.
On the 2 1st inst. Admiral Watson cabled the Xavy Department that Commander Very
had captured the City of Zamboanga on the 16th. He was aided by friendly natives and M
and was holding the town. Pending the arrival of reinforcements from Jolo. on the same day. < ien
eral Otis informed the War Department that he had ordered two companies of infantry to be sent to
Zamboanga from Jolo.
Zamboanga is the principal city of the island of Mindanao, which is the second largest
island of the Philippine group. Advice? from Admiral Watson indicate that the entire southern
half of the island, which comprises the province of Zamboanga. has yielded to the American forces
and acceded to the authority of the L'nitcd States.

DRAWS ELECTRICITY
FROM A CLEAR SKY
Remarkable Results Achieved bu a New
Jersey Man With the Aid of a
String of Kites.
KEW YORK, Nov. 2G.â While pursuing his experiments in kite flying at
Kayonne, N. J., William A. Edd? has arrived at a result which he believes
can be made serviceable In war signaling nloft. According to Mr. Eddy, in
his latest experiment. In which he sent nloft an electric light drawn from the
surrounding' atmosphere, he has achieved a result hitherto unknown.
A steady electric light, emanating from a clear sky and without a bat
tery # friction machine or dynamo, t*gan to glow at the earth and five min
ute later It was paid out upward to a height of about 4 f Â» feet, where it
remained for about half an hour. It was then hauled li for the purpose of
changing the spark gap. This sparking apparatus, operated by Mr. Eddy,
was suspended from a Fted wire suspended aloft by one kite six feet in
diameter, the wire being attached directly to a kite, which carried It upward
without other cable or flying line,
Mr. Eddy's plans were overthrown when the experiment came to be car
ried out. He had believed that if he ran the base of his kite cable wire to
a grounding rod at the earth that the electricity aloft would be compelled to
leap acrors the Fpark gap with great power and frequency. Power was
thr re, but not the frequency. The fln>t Fparks were large, like those of a Leydon
jar. Mr. Eddy tried to stop the spark by throwing off the groundling rod,
thus making one epark g.\p In midair and another at a distance of about
eighteen Inches betwr-cn the reel â  '.rum and the earth. Instead of stopping
t!ie pparks this caused an Incessant stream of them aloft. At the same time
the Ftee! wire wound upon the drum of the reel became charged like a
Leydon Jar. and the steol spindle or core which passed through the drum be
came a ppark coil, so that It was Impossible to wind In or pay out wire from
the drum without receiving powerful shocks at one second Intervals which
foro'd Mr. Eddy to leave the reel in haste.
The stream of sparks making light kept on. but for a time It was Im
pofiible to pay out the wiro und send the light upward. Finally by means
of ptne sticks, extra grounding rods were applied and It then became possible
to send a light upward. It was found that throe bluish brush lights were form
ed, one above and one below the spark gnp, where the wire was spliced and one
th* *R4-ot^be reel -and that while the ii & ht was playing incessantly
aloft a budden grounding of the wire would cause an especially large EDark
both at the spark gap aloft und at the reel drum at the earth "

AGUINALDO'S FATE
IF HE BE CAPTURED
WASHINGTON. Nov. 28.-Oonslderablo
Interest iÂ» brine taken In official circles
as to the disposition of Agulnaldo In case
of his capture. Some persons say that
the host solution would be his dÂ«'.ath in
action, but this is not expected. Should
he be eapturod. General Oils will un
doubtedly await Instructions from Wash
ington as to the treatment he Fhould ac
cord him. Should Aguinaldo escape to
Hongkong the United States could not,
a? a matter of right, ask for hi? surren
der, and the President would, therefore,
doubtless determine to leave the insur
gent leader alone.
In connection with the disposition of
Agulnaldo In case- of capture, the authori
ties would have to consider the effect ol
the policy upon the natives. When the
Insurrection is finally subdued, a civilian
or commission will be sent to govern tho
Philippines. The archipelago will bo di
vided into four military departments, the
Inland of I_uznn !n two. over which Gen
Â«.ral!> I.awton and Mac Arthur will proba
bly preside. General Otis needs rc*t and
isÂ« expected to return to the United States
when he Is satisfied there is no longer
any need of his remaining at Manila.

Ripe to Take Action Concern
ing the Islands.
BOISE. Idaho. Nov. 2S.â Senator Shoup
and family left to-day for Washington,
but will stop a day in Salt Lake. In an
Interview before leaving the Senator said
the time was ripe, in his opinion, for
Congress to lake acton with respect to
Hawaii and Porto Rico. Hp said we know
a* much now about the needs of those
ielands as we could know after another
yeaT. and he favored the enactment of
such legislation as shall appear to be
necessary. lie did not think It would be
practicable to legislate for the Philippines
or for Cuba at this time.
Spesvking ot Cuba, the Senator said he
was in favor of continuing the occupation
until the leading people of the Inland
shall have had tull opportunity to deter
mine what they desire for the future.
After they have had this opportunity to
make up their minds intelligently on tho
pubject, the question of the future of the
islands should be put to a vote among
them. If they desire annexation to the
United States they will so declare at tho
ballot-box, "and," the Senator added. "If

Referring in a general way to the ques
tions arising as a result of the war with
Spain. Senator Shoup said he was in
hearty accord with the policy of the ad
ministration on evtry point and it would
be his pleasure to give his support to the
plans of tho Government respecting the
management of our new possessions and
the treatment of Cuba.
Referring particularly to thÂ« Philippines.
the Eenator said he favored the policy of
cruFhir.g the rebellion. He was of I Ik
opinion that the war proper was at an
<nd, but there would probably be a guer

"Our particular business now," he con
rluderl. "Is to put down the rebellion. It
will be time enough after that to talk
about the future of the islands."

JOUBERT SAYS ENGLAND
HAS A DESPERATE TASK
BERLIN. Nov. 26.â The Deutsche Zel
tun? publishes a letter purporting to come
from General Joubert, and dated Lady-
Bmlth, October 27, in which the writer
says :
"Even If we do not succeed in prevent
ing the concentration of General Buller's
troops, the British army will be weak
ened from natural causes to such an ex
tent that not more than 35,000 effective
troops, or 40,000 at the outside, can take
the fteld. The others must be employed
to protect communications. It Is to be
borne iri mind that not only Natal but
Cape Colony, with a base of operations
covering 435 miles, must be considered.
"Our bases of supplies are at home and
organized on the relay system in three
directions. To protect these does not re
quire 100 men. If one base should be peri
ously threatened the supplies will be de
stroyed. A war of defense, of which we
need not think for a considerable time,
would present far greater advantages
than an clTensive war. We are at home hi
the highlands of the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State. - The British will have
to contest every step under great difficul
ties and must be prepared at every mo
ment to fight on two or three fronts.
"Then will begin a guerrilla war which
the British will not be able to endure.
Already we have 50,000 men in tho field, so
wo do not need to calculate upon a rising
of the Boers in Cape Colony and Natal.
Nevertheless, if the British stir up the
natives and employ them to fight us there
will be a rising of the whole of Afrikaa
derdom." v. â â 
ANXIETY REGARDING
THE NINTH LANCERS
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â Tribune has
tho following from London: No further
official intelligence regarding the battle of
Gras Pan had been received at the War
Office up to the time of cabling, and this
morning's papers have no information re
garding the, engagement from their cor
respondents at the front. Some anxiety
is consequently exprespeil regarding tho
Ninth Lancers, who had been placed so as
to intercept the Boer retreat.
From Natal the news Is now coming to
hand somewhat more freely. Communi

LONDON CHRONICLE'S
EDITOR FORCED OUT
NEW YORK, Nov. 2-5.-The World cable
from London says: H. V.'. Massingham's
resignation of th- editorship of the Dally
Chronicle is a striking example of the ex
tent to which Jingo influences dominate
the Liberal pnrty.
The World correspondent has authority
for stating that Mr. Massingham was re
quested by the i>rt.']>r!etors of the Chroni
cle to suspend nil further crltlcism of the
South African policy of the Government
while the war continue?, but as Mr. MaÂ»
plngham had taken :i strong antl-jir.go
line he refused to stultify himself by ac
ceding to this extraordinary request, and
resigned.
Through this receding >f the Chronicle
the only influential London dally which
has opposed Jingoism disappears. It is
believed that its proprietors were impelie,d
to this change of front by ministerial and
other influences actuated by the extreme
gravity of the South African situation and
the Imperative necessity for supprt-sblng
all criticism of the war and exposure of
j its apparently inevitable result by inde
pendent newspapers. It is rumored t'rat
similar steps have been taken to silence
; the Evening Echo, which followed the
', Chronicle lines.

ROOT'S POLITICAL
CHANCES GROW BRIGHTER
Most Prominently Considered for the
Vice Presidency, Though Hay
Is Mentioned.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â Secretary of
War Hoots chances to obtain the Repub
llcun nomination for the Vice-Presidency
on the ticket With Mr. McKinley, have
been greatly improved by the collapse of
the Insurrection in the Philippines. Up to
the present time everything In that quar
ter has turned out to the advantage of
the Secretary of War. He entered the
Cabinet when the country, had become
tired of the way in which the War De
partment and the Philippine campaign
had been managed. There was an imme
diate change for the better. â¢â¢
While Mr. Root is looked upon as tha
administration candidate for the nomina
tion, other possibilities are still talked of
and If It should bo concluded that Mr.
Hoot's nomination would be unwise some
other Eastern man will be taken. Discus
*lon thus far is confined to New York
names, with the exception of Secretary of
Btate Hay, who, it is believed, would
make â  strong candidate. In spite of re
ports that Governor Roosevelt does not
wish the Vice Presidential nomination, he
is still discussed and there are strong In
fluences that will be exerted In his favor
if it Is seen thai the field la open. Briga
dier General Frederick D. Grant has not
had such an opportunity to distinguish
himself In the Philippine campaign as his
friends hoped he might have and it la
not believed that he will be considered as
a candidate.

CUBANS YEARN
FOR INDEPENDENCE
â¢ L_
League and National
Party Meet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Nov. 26â Five thousand peo
ple attended the meeting of the delegates
of the Cuban League and National party
to-day. It was expected that the questions
of the civil governshlp and the appoint
ment of the new Bishop of Havana would
bo discussed. As it turned out these mat
ters were only lightly touched upon.
Senor Borges, who was one of the prin
cipal speakers, said:
"The Americans have helped the Cubans
in their time of need, but it Is yet to be
shown that they are as generous as at
first they seemed. There have been
Cubans who died in the hope of securing
Independence, and there are Cubans who
are ready to imitate their example."
Senor Gonzales said: "Cubans must not
break the law by appealing to arms to
settle this question of civil government.
By such a course they would merely grat
ify those who wish to show the world that
Cubans cannot respect law."
Senor Zazas said: "We Cubans watch
over independence like parents over a sick
child. It is natural that we should not
forget our many sleepless nights. There
is naught for us to do but to finish our
work and to secure independence."
From every part of the island communi
cations are received by the local papers
protesting against a civil Governor Gen
eral. Almost without exception every
paper published in Spanish has objected.
The majority condemn the project utter
ly. The minority think that any change
to be made should be by way of reduc
ing the number of American troops In the
island. â¢

The extensive operations of the Frank
lin Syndicate and exhaustle&s credulity of
the American people are shown by the
numbor of dividend drafts which are held
by the different city banks. These drafts
were sect Ihrpugh the mails by Miller to
subscribers living at distant points, and
they deposited them In their local banks
for collection. The local banks in turn
m nt them to the New York banks, which
act as their agents here. These drafts ar
rived on Saturday. Many more are ex
pected this week. As the syndicate has
asbigm-d. the drafts will be returned to
their dupes.
The National City Bank alone has
about y>o of the drafts sent here by banks
in Allegheny, Pa.; Portland. Me.; Klsle,

which will bring the missing head of Uiu

Although at police headquarters it is
believed he is in hiding in or dOM to the
city, precautions have oeen taken to place

The Chiefs of Police of every city in this
country tmd Canada have been asked to

acknowledged that it Is comparatively
easy for a shrewd man to get out of the

The Figaro and Temps appreciate these
truths and consistently advocate a con
ciliatory policy and condemn the rabid
attacks of the Nationalist press, which. if
they had no other regrettable character
istic, would be in bad taste. I>e Rlre, for
example, this week devotes to the English

Queen Is made the ob'ect of attack and
ridicule, and even her failing sight has not
escaped. It Is this feature of Anglophobia
raging In the Nationalist press that has
given most offense.
The Figaro this morning prints a letter
from a Frenchman residing In London and
occupying an Important office. He says:
"The attacks on the Queen have un
chained a storm of anger here of which
you can have no Idea in Paris, because the
English papers are read there but little.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON' HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Nov. Aâ
Outraged public sentiment will turn Brig
ham H. Roberts, self-confessed polyga
mlst Representative-elect from Utah, out
of the House of Representatives.
It is In vain that Mr. Roberts raises
legal technicalities and tries to show that
' he has in no way violated the strict letter
of the compact which was entered Into be
tween the United States and Utah when
the State was admitted. The moral Â»en
timent of the whole people has risen In
' revolt, and Mr. Roberts and his legal
i technicalities will be ruthlessly brushed
! aside. Even many of those Representa
| tives who are inclined to the belief that
Mr. Roberts has kept within the strict let
ter of the agreement as to polygamy will
not resist the pressure that la "being
brought to bear upon them by their con
stituents. Though comparatively few of
the Representatives-elect have yet ar
rived in Washington, the expressions of
those who are here make it very apparent
that there will be a large majority of the
members of the House opposed to allow
ing Mr. Roberts to sit among them.
Interviews with those who have arrived
lead Irresistibly to the conclusion that
either Mr. Roberts will not be allowed to
take his seat at all, or that he will be ex
pelled from It after the House has had
the report of the committee and has
heard both sides of the case. Mr. Rob
erts will not be without some supporters
on the floor. The technical defense which
j he sets up meets the approval of some
of the members, and he will not be with
out champions able and ready to make a
strong tight In his behalf.
Proceedings over his case bid fair to
overshadow In Interest the proposed finan
cial legislation, questions relating to the
I newly acquired territory of the United
. States ana every other matter that will
â  come before the House at the beginning
| of the session. Just what the character of
these proceedings will be no one at pres
ent knows. Whether or not Mr. Roberts
will be prevented from taking his seat
at all when other members of the House
are sworn In will depend very largely
j upon the action of Mr. Henderson as
I Speaker. Mr. Henderson has not yet inti
1 mated what course he will pursue. The
I House has from time to time refused to
! allow men to be sworn in when there were
conflicting credentials, but there has
never been a case in which there was â 
refusal to administer the oath to a man
who presented his certificate of election
in due form and absolutely uncontested
by a rival applicant for the seat.
There will be conferences between the
opponents of Mr. Roberta during the
present week, and an agreement will be
reached before the House meets on Mon
day as to the method to be pursued. If
It Is decided that the House has a right
to refuse to allow Mr. Roberts to tako
the oath until his title to his seat has
been 'investigated, the procedure will be
to then refer thÂ« whole, question to a com
mittee â either a committee on elections
or a judiciary committee, and there will
be nothing more for the House to do until
it is called upon to art upon the -eport of
thru committee. Should the committee
report unfavorably on Beating; Mr. Rob
erts, its report could be adopted by a
simple majority vote.
Jf. one the other hand. It should b* de
cided th it Mr. Roberts must be allowed
to take his seat, a resolution of expulsion
will he Immediately Introduced. This
would gr> probably to the Judiciary Com
mittee for report on local questions in

House would require a two-thirds vote.
G. W. DICKEY MAKES A
NOTABLE PREDICTION
Says That Ere Long Steel Ships One
Thousand Feet Long Will Bo
Built on Pacific Coast.
NEW TORK, Nov. 2Câ <ioorp<> W.
;â  , maiuiÃer of the Tnlon Iron
Works of San Francisco, during a speech
at the banquet of the Society of N;ival
Archltocti and Marino KnKin^ors In thla
city, made a noteworthy prediction In re
gard to tha future development of the
iron shipbuilding industry of the Pacific
r..n<=t.
â¢About twenty-five years ago," said Mr.
Dickey. "1 Bald to some friends of mine
it won't be many jtars before we are
building Iron ships on the Pacific Coast.
My friend, Irving Scott, heard of this
â one time later, and he Is said to have
; made this comment: 'I always knew
L>ickey rould tell a mighty good story. l>ut
this time he has gone way beyond thÂ«
1 bounds of reason. Why, lt"s absurd.'
"Now, I'll make another prediction,"
continued Mr. Dickey. "I believe that
within a few years we. nhall be building
steel ships on the Pacific Coast, with
ner.rly two hundred feet of length for
each thousand miles they have to travel;
that 1h ships at least one thousand feet
long. Transatlantic ships have reached
these proportions, and I believe Pacific
ships will soon do the same thing."
A prominent naval architect of this city,
who w.t* present at tha society's dinner,
said that ne fully believed In the sound
r Mr Dickey's prediction. "Mr.
Dicker knows pretty well what he Is talk-
Ing about." said he. "The fact that he
really deserves the credit for designing
, the battleship Oregon gives weight to his
present opinion."
GOEBEL MAY SUE FOR
AN INJUNCTION
Belief ThÃt He Will Seek to Prevent
a Recount of Votes in Three
Counties.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Nov. 2<5.-A quiet
Bxinday brought a lull in the political situ
ation to all outward appearances. There
were n<> significant developments from
Goebel headquarters, though Goebel and
his manners remained In conference dur
ing the duy. There la a general Impression
outside that some move is to be mad" by
Goebel early this week, and It 1b gener
ally supposed that a mandatory Injunction
suit to prevent the State Election Board
from counting the votes of Jefferson
Knox and Johnson counties will b<- j.irt
of It. though this ih not confirmed by any
one in authority. It is doubtful If Gov
ernor Bradley would recognize <JoÂ»Â»bH as
Governor if he were given a certificate of
election by the State Election Hoard un
less their action was In obedience to a
ruling of the court. In that event it is be-
Ueved he would resist no further but
would advise Taylor to contest before the
Legislature.
Neither Hradley. Taylor nor any of the
Republican leaders, however, believe that
the Court of Appeals. In the face of its
decision In the Nelson County case yes

to-day more confident than ever that the

â¢
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.-In official and
diplomatic quarters much interest w.is
manifested to-day m the plan put forward
in London cables of a treaty among the
great powers defining spheres of inllui.-nc.<
in China. That anything In the shape of
a formal treaty i.s to be made between the
powers Interested la the future of China
jib the outcome of the negotiations now
in progress is not believed here, though
an understanding of a less formal nature
is possible. The.se negotiations, following
the frank request of Secretary Hay upon
some of the governments which had al
ready given him verbal and informal as
surances of the continuation of all our
treaty rights in Chinese territory to have
thesu agreements reduced to form. It is
not regarded as necessary- to go beyond
! that point, and although it frequently
happens as the result of Initiating nego
tiations that the scope of them is broad
ened far beyond anything originally In
contemplation, it is believed that such
will not bo thf case now, and that there
will be no necessity for a general and
formal treaty.
It would t- extremely difficult to frame
any such convention so as to secure the
approval of the United States without a
protracted struggle, that might disclose
Ulxagreeable weaknesses in the govern
ment policies, and. besides, the effort
would be sure to arouse opposition from
the considerable In the united States
which Is unalterably opposed to any sort
of foreign entanglements. Of course this
statement applies only to the I'nlted
States, and there could be no objection on
our part to the other powers Joining n a
treaty covering foreign rights In China
provided there was nothing In the agree
ment obnoxious to our Just and proper
claims. Un the whole, having in view the
highly satisfactory utterances in the
French Chamber yesterday of M. del Cas
se, the French Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, respecting the maintenance of the
'â¢oppn door" In China, there is felt In of
ficial quarters to be reason for expecting
a successful outcome of the negotiations
on this subject opened by thÂ« United
States.
At some of the foreign establishments
the proposition was considered a "feeler,"
resulting from the recent Inquiries made
by the American Government to the atti
tude of the great powers. Other influen
tial members of the diplomatics corps
pointed out that the plan was the logical
consummation of the scheme initiated be
tween Russia and Great Britain where the
spheres of influence would be defined. The
Chinese legation views the proposition as
purely conjectural, and the Chinese Min
ister, Mv Ting Fans, when his attention
was directed to the matter, regarded It as
preposterous.
"This is about the most refreshing sug
gestion we have had of late." remarked
Mr. Wu. "What, can it be serious they
proposed that a document shall be lor
mally drawn up concerning interests in
China and China shall not be a party to
it? It cannot have escaped attention that
China is a sovereign nation, and when it
comes to writing treaties concerning her
Interest! and territory this sovereign na
tion is quito likely to have considerable
to say on thÂ« subject. I hardly think any
of the great self-respecting powers would
give countenance to a plan such as is out
lined. It is as though a party of your
neighbors met and agreed how they would
occupy your house. One would take the
front door, another would select tha side
door, others would appropriate certain
rooms. And all this without consulting
you, the owner of the house. Such a
course by individuals would seem strango
indeed, and it would amount to the same
thins among nations. Of course, all things
are. possible, and it is difficult to say how
far a plan once entered upon may pro
ceed, while the individual may be quite
secure In his residence, it Is. of course,
always within the bounds of possibility
that a band of robbers may arrange to
enter the house and carry away the be
longings. For that reason It Is the part
of wisdom for the individual to be on the
lookout against such moves. But it is not
to be supposed that a nation stands in
any such danger, as the great nations
would not countenance such a course, so
that the suggestions of a treaty of this
character appear to me to be entirely vis
ionary."
At ore of the embassies It was rented
out that the United States was hardly
likely to become a party to a treaty defin
ing thÂ»Â» spheres of Influence of other pow
ers, while at the same time no sphere of
American Influence was defined, and up to
the present time it has been definitely un
derstood that the United States did not
seek any sphere of influence, but merely
untrammeled entrance to all Chinese
ports. As to the other powers, the view
prevailed that they would be quite likely
to favor such a. comprehensive treaty as
the one outlined In the London advices as
It carried forward the arrangement be
tween Great Britain and Russia, by which
the former secured a sphere of Influence
In the Yanj?-Tse Valley and Russia direct
ed her activities to Northeast China.
Since returning from abroad the Ger
man Embassador. Dr. yon Holleben. has
stated that the German policy in Klao
chau was distinctly that of the "open
door." and Count Cassinl. the Russian
Embaspador. has stated the same policy
ns to the Russian port of Tallen \Vhn.
The British position favorable to open
ports is well known, and since I>ord
Pauncefote's return occasion has been
taken to reiterate It. Beyond this, how
ever, there has been nothing from any of
the foreign representatives concerning the
future of China, and without exception
the representatives of powers having In
terests in China state positively that n â¢
Instructions have been received as to
treating with reference to China. This
amÂ»Hes -also -to the Japanese Minister and
the French Charge d'Affalrea, who, while
they have made Inquiries of the State
Department as to the basis for current
reports, have no Instructions to act re
specting China.

PRKINO. Nov. 26.â L1 Hung Chang's

to tend to improve greatly foreign com

QUAY IS CONFIDENT
HE WILL BE SEATED
Claims That a Majority of Senators
Are Pledged to Support
Him.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â The Philadelphia ,
Inquirer, Quay's organ, claims that sixty j
Senators will vote to seat him. An article '
wired to that paper and evidently emanat- ,
Ing from Quay's manager in Washington, |
says:
M. 8. Quay will undoubtedly be seated
by the United States Senate. It will only j
require a majority vote to accomplish this
result, but it can be positively stated that
over two-thirds of the total membership j
of the Senate wil be recorded in his favor
In other words, out of eighty-six Senators
Colonel Quay will be supported by about
sixty. The names of all the Senators who
will vote to seat the distinguished Penn
sylvanlan are in the possession of Senator j
quay's Intimate friends here, but they
will not be made public at present for the I
reason that quite a number of the pledges j
of support have been given In confidence.
One factor that has materially contribut- I
ed to the large vote which Colonel Quay
will receive has been the methods employ- '
ed by the insurgent leaders in Pennsyl- I
vania to accomplish his defeat.
A distinguished Democratic Senator
from the South, who is a close student of
State politics, said to-night that he had
but recently made up his mind to vote In
favor of Quay. The Senator who gave
utterance to these sentiments is one of the
best known public men in the country and '
his views arÂ« largely representative of
feeling on both sides of the chamber. In
fact. it Is freely predicted by Senator
Quay's friends here that if the insurgents '

to-day. In the presence of 200) Germans,
presented a flag sent by the Emperor Wil
liam to the United German soldiers' so
cieties In Chicago. In delivering the gift
Dr. yon Holleben said:
"I bring you greeting from the German
Emperor. He commissioned me to give
you the flag that you have so long wished
for, with the request that It be passed
from one of your societies to another, to
be kept by each for a year at a time. It
Is a sign of the gracious favor of the Em
peror and a token of the friendliness and
love which he beam for you and which
you have flaseiTed by your services to
your country, f.ir which many of you havo
fought and bW-d on the battlefield. It Is a
symbol of German truth and manhood. It
Is the symbol ol .1 German soldier's honor.
The United States Is bound close with
Germany by racial ties and Intimate
friendship. I beg >>( you to take this Mag
as a symbol of national unity."
A~ the fliwr was unfurled the crowd rose
and cheered f'Â»r several minutÂ«s, while the
band played the German national air.
The German Embassador called for
thn-e cheers (or the Emperor, which were
heartily given. The spectators then rose
and sang "The Star Spangled Banner."
I>r. yon Holleben refused to discuss po
litical matters, but paid to a reporter:
"Germany has the kindliest feelings to
ward the United States, and it seems as if

carry out their threat of sending a com
mittee to Washing-ton to protest against
Beating him. they will only succeed in in
tensifying the sentiment for him and
solidifying his support. The appearance
of such a committee there, they say, will
give his champions In the senate a chance
to expose the reform pretenses of Martln-
Flinn brand of politicians and will thus
aid the Senator's cause.
The method of procedure by which Colo
nel Quay will be seated has been carefully
mapped out. On the opening day of the
session Senator Penrose will secure the
floor and present the credentials of hi*
colleague, signed by Governor Stone.
They will promptly be referral to the
Committee on Privileges and Elections, of
which Senator Chandler of New Hamp
shire is chairman and Senator Hoar of
Massachusetts ranking Republican mem
ber. That committee is overwhelmingly
in favor of Colonel Quay. In fact but one
man on the committee. Senator Burrows
of Michigan, has thus far declared against
the Pennsylvanlan. The committee will
meet at onco and will bring In a favorable
report within two days.
After the credentials have been favor
ably reported to the Senate, It Is not the
purpose of Senator Quay's friends to con
sume much time in debate. But few
speeches will be made In his Interest, the
principal one. of course, to be delivered by
Senator Penrose. Opponents of Quay. It
is believed, will exhaust their oratorical
efforts In three or four days, and It Is
confidently expected that within one weÂ«k
after Congress assembles Senator Quay
will be occupying his usual seat.

TRfIDE APPARENTLY STILL EX
PAMDING.
LAST week was noteworthy in the history of
the clearing house. Of the eighty-four cities
â ad towns reporting bank clearings only two
showed a decrease in business from the same week
in 189 S. Galveston fell off 2.8 per cent Hid Macon,
Ga^ 19.2 per cer.t. This is a remarkable exhibit, for
it shows a gain in trade all over the United Stares,
with its immense territory and great variety of in
dustries. The pain of the whole country was 41. 1
per cent, the largest being one of 103.8 per cent at
Pittsburg, the latter being interesting as showing
continued activity in the iron trade. The gain at
New York was 352 per cent, at Boston 44.1, at Chi
cago 54.6 and at San Francisco 57.4.
ln the face of these brilliant return?, however, a
falling oft in the distributive trade of the country is
reported, due to unreasonably mild weather, which
restricts the sale of winter goods. Prices for most
commodities are firm, however, and textile goods,
particularly cotton and wool, are especially firm,
with prospects of higher prices, and sales of raw wool
exceed all records, footing up 61.694,000 pounds for
the first three weeks in ....... while in only one
full month heretofore have the sales ever amounted
to 60.000.000 pounds. The demand for good? is so
large that the mills arc encouraged to keep on buying
in fpite of the advancinz Quotations.
Trade in boots and shoes continues remarkably
heavy and considerably in excess of former year?.
though it is mostly on back orders, as new orders are
checked by the steep prices for hides and leather.
the former being scarce up to the famine point. Not
for years has there been sr.ch a hide market as to-day.
The iron trade is marked by irregularity, some de
scriptions heir.? higher and others lower, and the
same condition applies to the minor metals. For the
first time in months the failures <how an increase,
being 191 For the week. af?ainst 18S for the same
week last year. Scarcity in cars continues to worry
thippers a!l over the country, and some shipments
of dried fruit from San Francisco to New York have
consumed thirty days in the journey. This is not
without its compensation, however, for it keeps a
pood-Â«ired army of men employed at the different car
works, to say nothing of the adjunctive demand for
wood and iron.

OUT of the depths of their pit the fallen con

THE CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH AFRICA.
WHEN General Bu:!er was offered command of
the British forces in the war against the Boers
he is reported to have stipulated before
accepting it that he should have a frer hand in the
conduct ol the a:.\ that his dispatches from the
front. <hou!d not he made public. P. . -.'ions
were conceded by the Government and the genera] is
now working as he thinks best and in Â«ecreoy to
fulfill his promise to the Queen and force the war to
a swift conclusion.
In the .ib-ence of authoritative diÂ«pat.-nrÂ« and n
rehenshre account of what is going on at the
front there has been naturally a pood deal of anxiety
in London as to the situation. There are reports of
battles here and there, of sorties at Mafeking or
Ladysmith. of the advance of relief columns and of

the efforts made by the Boers to check them. These
affairs constitute the news of the day, and to the pub
lic appear to be about all there is to the war. As a
matter of fact they are but a minor feature of it, for
the main movement is that which Buller is himself
preparing in silence and secrecy to strike at Pretoria.
The object of the British in maintaining their com
paratively weak garrisons at Mafeking, Kimberley
and Ladysmith was from the first to prevent the Boers
from making a swift rush to the coast and capturing
the ports which the British would need for the land
ing of their troops. That object has now been ac
complished. The first fierce rush of the Boers has
been stopped. Durban is safely occupied by British
troops and the transports have landed men in thou
sands with safety. Detachments have been sent to
the relief of the besieged garrisons, but the main
has not yet been struck, nor has the army des
tined to make it started on its march. Buller is evi
dently taking his time. Before leaving London he
stated he would hardly be ready to advance before
December, and it looks as if he does not intend to
it Kruger to hurry him or to lead him to change
the plan he devised at the outset.
It is to be noted that while London is much
â \ over affairs at Ladysmith and Mafeking. the
commanding general does not seem to be at all
alarmed. He has managed to keep himself out of the
newspapers with more than ordinary skill. Rarely
does a report from South Africa say anything about
him. If he can keep the Boers busy hammering
away at the fortifications of the three besieged towns
until he gets his corps ready to advance into the
Transvaal itself, he will have achieved a marked ad
vantage. The Boers will then have to hasten back
to the defense of their capital, and the hastening will
be dene under difficulties.
. Taking all things into consideration the vital point
of the war just now is not at Ladysmith, but at what
ever place Buller is getting his corps ready for the
march. The rest is hardly more than skirmishing.
According to the London Chronicle the British
Cabinet has decided that the only basis of settlement
for the trouble in South Africa will be a united coun
try modeled on the Canadian plan. Can the British
Cabinet be counting its chickens before they ire
hatched?
A daring speculator of New York haÂ« been indicted

SflN FRANCISCO'S Tri^NKSGIVING
AS we swing into Thanksgiving week it is worth
while to take note of the general fitness of
the people for celebrating that kind of a fes
tival. We need not hunt up statistics of trade and
industry, nor count up the gains made in the year,
to find cause for being assured that the feast will be
a merry one. Abundant evidences can be seen of
the prosperity ot the time by simply looking at the
people on the street.
Did ever San Francisco show so many richly
dressed, beautiful, happy looking women along her
streets as at this time? Market and Kearny are is
radiant every bright afternoon as if they had been
prepared for a reception to royalty. There could not
be such a shimmer of silk, such a glow of velvet,
such a sparkle of jewels, such a glory of rich bonnets,
arraying such an endiess succession of fair women
passing and repassing up and down, if the men of
the city were not doing big business and doing it
well.
It takes money to support a pretty woman in proper
manner and give her scope for the swing of her
style. There must be much coin where there are so
much of beauty, of fashion and of feathers, and to
attain that coin there must be an industry and a com
merce in comparison with which those that made Tyre
famous and Babylon great were hardly more than
petty trades.
ver the men along the street are buoyant
and joyous. They are evidently earning all the costly
D of this resplendent womanhood as lightly ?.s
â¢ - They can afford it and they like to do it. It
- them to see an inestimable girl with a 10
Sander feather in a $40 hat, with a $500 sealskin
on her back, and money enough in her purse 'to do
her shopping to her taste and have carfare left.
In this brightness of the city, this glow of good
humor which shines from every eye and smiles from
face, there are all the evidences we need that
Francisco is ready for Thanksgiving. The men
are proud of a city that has so many lovely women,
the women are pleased to see that men appre
ciate their efforts to make everything gay, generous
and glorious. Nor would there be so much of sparkle
on the street if there were not happiness in the home.
In fact the radiance in public is but the outward show
of the richer, warmer glow that illuminates the bliss
hidden in the privacy of home life.
Francisco is ready for Thanksgiving and for
the holidays that come after it. It is the season for
spending money and there is money to spend and
le to spend it. Come rain, or come shine, all is
â¢ <ble and all is pleasing that befalls us. We have
the best country in the world, the best State in the
country, the best city in the State and each man has
he best girl in the city. Hurry up the feast; the
appetite is already: serve the turkey.
Gifts of champagne, pate de foie gras and plum
puddings studded with jewels represent the latest
I of British enthusiasm for the fighters in South
Africa. If the craze continues the English military
authorities will find it necessary to doctor the troops
as wc'.l as the news.
The disagreement of the jury in the case of Harada
far damages against the Southern Pacific Company is
reasonably clear evidence that any one who values
his life or limbs must carry hi> own guard gates with
him when in the neighborhood of the railroad's
tracks.
The difficulty of forming a peace society out of
warriors is being admirably illustrated in the efforts
to organize the "Spanish War Veterans." The
worthy survivors of the war never said half as many
mean things of the Spaniards as they are now saying
of one another.
The shocking expose of the affairs of the Eureka
S y for the Protection of Children very dearly
opens a wide field for public service by the Society
for the Suppression of Vice. The torture of children
has not yet been legalized in San Francisco.

march in the Soudan the "howling Dervishes." who
have been so potent in rocking nervous people into
fits, will be as silent as the ancient Sphinx.

The Hidden Treasure Mining Company,

In the State, has Just had the luck to
strike a new and rich buried channel in
the Hidden Treasure ground on the For

channel Is thirty-two feet lower than the

gravel, at places going $5 to the car. The
strike was made 6000 feet from the mouth
of the tunnel, which is now about two
miles long and through which the gravel
is hauled out by an electric underground
trolley system.

in long trains. The extent <.f the opera
tions and the richness of the property,
the product of whkh has reached Iran

The property Is chiefly owned by Harold

The oil field is more noisy than ever
with "news" and hustling. It Is still the
preparatory season of the mustering of
many Investors and a good many derricks
and the flotation of companies before
failures begin to make people more wary.
The week has produced some reports of
oil strikes, especially In the McKlttrlck
and Kern River districts of Kern County,
where It seems likely that valuable oil
deposits will be found. A report of an
oil strike may vary according to the day
or iree from ten to 1000 barrels a day,
as have the reports from a Kern County
well within the past few days.
A Kern County oil man from Lob An
geles is looking for water as well as oil,
and If a water supply Is found by boring,
ha proposes to pipe It about the. Kern
River district to supply the rigs now ope
rating or planned. In boring for oil, wa
ter Is generally. everywhere in the oil
fields of the world, an expensive nuisance,
requiring pumping and casing with -pack-
Ing below the water stratum to keep It
from the oil-producing bottom. In some
of the districts of the semi-arid San Joa
quin Valley, however, no water supply is
struck In borlnir. Water is needed both
for steam power and, In sufficient
amount, for the bottom of the well, to
facilitate boring. The oil men want wa
ter, but know when they have enough. In
th* Coallnga field the boring of many
wells has waited for a water supply,
â¢which 1? now partially secured by piping
from the hills. The Coallnga Water Com
pany Is laying five miles m water pipe to
supply the want. Two miles of pipe are
laid and when the supply arrives pros

Coallnga Oil Company sells $iy>o worth of
water per month to the operators of the
district, and water wells are being sunk
on i..c plains.
A reliable correspondent of the Mining
and Scientific Press writes from Coallnga
as follows:
"About a dozen outfits are sinking wells
In various parts of the Oil City district
and a dozen more fire on the ground

district Is 2000 barrels of crude oil per day.
This li conveyed to tanks on the line of

THE CHURCH LOOTING CONTROVERSY.
Editor Connelly of the Monitor Takes Exception to the Recent Statements of
Chaplain McKinnon.
[The Call publishes communications In
which subjects of general interest are
discussed Â».r containing informutl.in that
will be of interest to Its readers, without
holding itself responsible for the opin
ions of the writers. ]
Editor The Callâ Sir: Will you kindly
permit me a little space In which to make
clear one or two points touched upon by
Father McKJnnon In his rather Incohe
rent 'â rÂ»in>" t" certain statements In the
Monitor affecting his position on the sub
ject of "Church Looting In Luzon"? The
hat many persons who read thin
"reply" in The Call did not read the edi
torial In the Monitor, to which it has ref
erence, is my only reason for making the
request. 1 shall not take any notice of
the vulgar abuse or uncalled for person
alities in which the chaplain Bees lit to
indulge. They do not deserve any. II
Father McKinnon is satisiu-d to put him
self on record in that way, 1 do not
grudge him the gratification that his gift
in that direction affords.
With regard iv the first item In his bill
of particulars, to wit: the stricture of the
Northwestern Catholic on time-serving
Catholic chaplains, I have only to Â»ay
that Father McKinnon having voluntarily
applied the cap to hit own head he is
welcome to wear It.
Item Nc. l is more Important. It has
to do with Failier McKinnon's alleged re
ply to Mrs. Fur: . , Ury concerning
the propriety of appropriating to her own
u!>e a piece of goods, or a robe said to
havtt been onoe a portion of the â 
ment of a statue of a Virgin in Cal â _Â»<*
can Church. Father McKinnon calls this
a "malignant Item" and denounces the
story as a lie. In that case, if Father
Reaney is correctly reported by the De
troll Journal, th* chaplain of the Olym
pia is the liar. Here is thÂ« story exactly
v it appeared originally in the Detroit
Journal, as the statement of Father
Reaney:
"After our troops had taken pop-*' -
(of Caloocan Church) somebody. I don't
know who. presented Mrs. Funston with
what is said to have been once a part of
thÂ« raiment of a statue of the Virgin.
Mrs. Funston showed it to Father M--
Klnnon and asked him if there would be
any harm In her having It.
"Father McKinnon, you know, was the
chaplain of the First California Regi
ment, who goes back asÂ» private secretary
to Archblsh j> Chapeite, aftd Is also a
chaplain still lie was the first Ani'-rlcan

McKinnon told me that on examining the
garment, or cl^th. or whatever it was â he
couldn't tell what It had beenâ whÂ«-thÂ«-r
It was of silk or something el.--
whether the purpose for which it had

and several outfits are sinking well*

actlvltiy which marks this industry. The
newspapers at Hanford devote consider
able space to oil literature and gossip,
while the investors or magnates make
this town their headquarters, congregat
ing mainly at the Hotel Artepta.
Oil prices remain steady and are apt to
do so until a very large Increase In the
yield Is In sight. Los Angeles crude oil
sells now at II 10. The superior Coalinga
product is practically all delivered under
contract In San Francisco and about the
bay at unknown prices. It is reported
that last week $1 10 wu refused by one of
the Coallnga producing companies and
$1 20 asked. As has been reported In the
newspaper dispatches, the Standard Oil
Company has again raised the price of
Eastern crude petroleum to $1 IS per bar

of. 49 cents within three months and re

San Francisco capitalists. through
Easton, : ridge & Co., are making more
heavy investments In producing wells In
the Los Angeles field. The properties of
the Hex un Company have now been
bonded. The wells are producing about
11,000 barrels a month, and If the deal Is
concluded wells yielding 25,000 barrels a
month or about half the yield of the Los
Angeles field, will be in the hands of San

AT THE CHURCHES
SPECIAL Thanksgiving service* were
ruing at the Third
: ':ial <"hurch. which wiw

Rev. Dr. : â¢ He took hla text
BU XIII:l-2, "Bless the Lord.
O my aoul. and all that Is within me
Bless the Lord. O
my soul, and forget not all his benefits."
After a review of the history of the day
the speaker said:
"Thanksgiving Is not an occasion, but
rather a spiritual temper or disposition^
It Is a right attitude toward God. We are
dependent upon a power other than our
selves for prosperity. All the genius In
the world cannot create a snowflake or
wring from the ekies^one drop of rain.
We simply seize the natural blessings to
evolve what men call prosperity. We are
living in prosperous times. Wheels hum
with prosperity; our ships and trains are
loaded with commodities and people are
saving their earnings. Thanksgiving Is
not for the successful only. God is in our
losses and our gains, in adversity and
prosperity. The spirit of Thanksgiving Is
the power to look on the bright side and
thank God and take courage."
"Gratitude Our Duty."
The First Christian Church, at Twelfth
and Mission streets, was ::l:ed with a
large lon yesterday morning.
1 for Thanksgiving week
wot- hHa. K--v. Frank S. Ft-rd preached
inon on the debt
of gratitude which humanity owes to God.

â¢God's Best Gift, Good Men."
The Sunday preceding Thanksgiving
was appropriately celebrated yesterday at
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church.
Market and Sixteenth streets. After a
beautiful musical programme, the Rev.
Theodore H. Woodward preached an en
nobling and spiritual sermon. He said In
part:
"The pessimist Is thankless and despair-
Ingâ to him the world Is barren and grow
in^ worse, men are false, governments
corrupt. The optimist holds entirely op
posite viewsâ to him everything Is good;
he laughs in the midst of troubles, he la
bors and grows strong. Material prosper
ity is the result of the unspeakable gift
of God to man.
"God's best gift to man is good and
great men. Look at the work of the great
men of California. James Lick conse
crated his immense fortune to the cause
of education. The Stanford University is
the result of the gift of a magnanimous
man and woman. These gifts are only
possible because of the unspeakable gift
of God."
"God Has Protected America."
A large congregation tilled the Evan
gelical Eniiiuucl Church, Twelfth and
-, yesterday morning, t
participate in thÂ«: happy Thanksgiving
service of the day. The pastor, Rev. F.
W. Fischer, dtl Tung discourse,
and his words were closely followed by
the congregation. He said, in brief:
"The nrst settlers in Atj | little
t.Â» be thankful for. Think of our fore
-- at Jamestown, in the Carolinas,
at Plymouth Rock. That little ban.i ol
< liberty in a wild land.
have become the treat American nation
of to-day, eighty millions strong. Qod
helped ar.d fostered this nation from Its
infancy till now. He watcned over it In
the dark hours â¢ f the revolution, he
guarded It in the trying days of the re
bellion, when brother fought with bro
ther.
â¢We have a united America. It Is not

Industl H and trade lead the

thankful for. Th<- spirit of ThanksgirinÃ
should tndÂ»-ed be ";>-Â»n us It should be
ued In the home and In the nation.
anil not by P rdl slons, hut in d'-eds."
"Gratitude Ennobles the Soul."
The RÂ»v. F B Cherington pr-Â»ach<Â»d
jestwdsy â â¢ ith Churefa <>n grat;
â¢'.g to God. Ti.
vices were attended by a large congrega
tion. The pastor said In ;
"Back of every chain of causes and ef
fects, however lons, stands God as the
ultimate cause of all good. Gratitude for
blessings is in Itself a blesslns- Gratitude
is the legitimate completion of every act
of blessing. God, as 'party of the first
part.' bestows the blessing, and when the
recipient, as 'party of the second part,' re
turns the thanks that are due. then, but
not until th D. is the transaction a com
pleted one.
"Like all virtues, "ratitude is strength
ened by exercise and atrophied by disuse.
Sometimes those who have received the
greatest an.: most abundant blessings are
the most Indifferent concerning them.
Sometimes those whose lives have been
most sparingly endowed with them, ap
parently have been most grateful for the
blessing* that have come.
"Gratitude Is a sign of nobility of soul.
Base natures do not have it. Swine feed
ing under the trees that drop their fruits
upon them, never look up with a sinele
grateful impulse. Souls of lofty nature
cannot live on that low level.
"Thanksgiving day.- observed devoutly
and sincerely by a nation, cannot leave
that nation on as low a level as It was be
fore."
Lest We Forget.
The V. M. C. A. auditorium was filled
yesterday morning by the members of the
First Baptist Church to listen to an elo
quent and spiritual sermon by their past
or, the Rev. Dr. K. A. Wood*. The serv-
Ices were appropriate for the Sunday
preceding Thanksgiving, and Dr. Woods'
discourse was on that subject. He said
In part:
"The nineteenth century has given us
a new Christianity, not that God has
changed or the Bible changed, but we
now understand then better. Now we re-
Jolco In the Lord and give thanks for his
goodness to us. True religion sweetens
the home life. In our Thanksgiving fes
tival let us thank God for home and lov-d
ones, let us rejoice In all the good things
of life, and most of all let us rejoice In the
Lord. Let us be thankful for life's bless
ings and opportunities and hopes.
"For our homes and loved i â¢â¢â¢Â». for our
country with Its glorious heritage, for
blessings personal and national, blessings
temporal and spiritual, let us give thanks.
And may our prayer ever be
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
L*Â«t we fon?etâ lest we forÂ»et."

VL THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
Katharine and Petruchio.
Shakespeare's treatment of the Kath
arine and Petruchio part of the old playâ
the only part In which he appears to have
become heartily Interested -is worthy of
special study. As 1 have remarked In the
preface to my edition of the play (1SS1).
he has bettered the characterization of
the old play, not only by making the per
sonages consistent with themselves, but
also by lifting them to a higher plane of
humanity."
Ferando decides to marry Kate because
her father has promised him GOOD crowns
If he will do It. Kate, at the very ttn>t
Interview with her rough wooer. says
aside:
But yet I will content and marrU him
For I methlnks have lived Â»oo lon* a maid*
And match him to (too) or cUt his manhoolÂ»
rood.
The taming process is in the same vein
as in the *tory of the wife lapped in
Morel's nkln. though not carried to the
same extreme of brutality.
It is passing strange that as many
critics have failed to pee that Shake
speare's Kate Is not the vulgar vixen
that the earlier playwright makes her.
Henry Giles, for example, says in his
"Human Life in Shakespeare":
Katharine is the shrew proper; eh* li not
â r"rtlvÂ«s. the la only Â»u!ky; not â¢area.itle. tut
â currilout; the shrew of blood an.l not of
brain: the shrew of will an* not of fancy: of
will without reason; obstinate without purpose;
whimsical without plÂ«yfu!neÂ»t. qu&rrelwome
without aimâ mixture of fool and flchter
which make* thÂ» perfect she-tormentor; a talk-
Ins termagant. Eh* ha* no tport In herself:
she serve* only to make tport for others, and

Â»uoh an Incarnate Ylrulene* ever ha.l ex;stÂ«n.-Â»
Schlegel calls Katharine "a young and
untamed girl, possessed Of none of the
attractions of her sex"; and yet Hortenslo
tells us, early In the play, that she Is
"young and beauteous, brought up as best
becomes a gentlewoman."
Petruchlo, too. has suffered at the hands
of certain critics, who make him coarse.
brutal and sordid, thinking only of money
In the match, and taming the wife whom
he does not love as he would break a
vicious horse.
All this Is moÂ»t superficial and most
unjust, and Shakespeare has carefully
guarded against giving us any such M-a
of the shrew and her conquetor. While
he h;is retained most of the Incidents of
the old play, he has recreated the actors.

Ing tyrant, like Â¥wn â  good-na
tured with all his rough whimsicality, and
heartily enamored of the willful glr!
whom ba â  i carried off in such
unconventional fashion.
We must not suppose that Kate is
merely bullied into marrying Petruchio,
or that the "taming" Is accomplished by
sheer persistence in the homeopathic
treatment which the husband adopt*. The
attempt to "cure like with like" would not
have been so promptly successful if the
lady had not been a half-willing "patient"
from the very tlrst. She want* to be
married, as she frankly admit* in her
talk with Bianca, and the desire is not
primarily due to her dislike to see her
ulster get a husband first, though that
feeling lias its influence in her matrimo
nial aspirations. Like Beatrice, whom she
resembles in many way*, though inferior
to that spirited and witty lady, she has a
loving nature beneath her sarcastic and
shrewish outside, and will make a good
wife for the man who can win her heart.
At the same time she knows that her
chances are not Â»o good as her sister's,
as her father also sees, and therefore re
fuses to let Bianca be married un;. Kate
Is off his hands. Under these circum
stances it Is natural that she should take
a liking to Petruchio at the outset, in
spite ofâ perhaps we should say on ac
count ofâ his bluff, free-and-easy wooing.
She sees that he is a genuine man and in
some respects a kindred spirit. She can
not help recognizing his superiority to the
rival suitors for her sister's hand. She
resents his advances at first as too eon
tldent and presumptuous, but Â»he is not
insensible to his praises of her beauty
When he says that it Is reported that she
limps, and asks her to let him see her
walk, she Instinctively desires to show
him that she does not limp, and obeys him
before it occurs to her to refuse. It is a
most significant little touch (not found in
the old play) and Petruchio sees at once
that his suit is half won already.
When ncr father. comes i:.. shÂ« affects
to hold off from the match, but it is only
for the moment, and the formal betrothal
is promptly consummated in the Italian
fashion. She and Petruchio Join hands,
with her father's approval, and Gremto
and Tranio are the witnesses to the cere
mony.
It is important that the formal char
acter of this betrothal should be noted,
as showing that Kate here accepts
Petruchio as her future husband. The
contract could not afterward be abro
gated without the consent of both the
parties. If Kate, seriously Intended to
resist or decline the match, this was the
time to do it. or ever after to hold her
peace. It may be said that she yields
to her father's authority, but this is not
the case. In the preceding scene he i.as
discouraged the suit of Petruchio rather
than urged it on. When asked If he has
not a daughter "called Katbarina. fair
and virtuous," he replies. "I have a
daughter â¢â ailed Katharina." and in the
next speech he says:
You're welcome, Â§lr: â¢ â¢ â¢
But (or my daughter Katherine. this I knew,
She la not for your turn, thÂ» more my Â«r.er.
and later, when the arrangements con
cerning the dowery are being made, and
Petrucnlo proposes to draw up the legal
papers, Baptista says:
Ay. when the fp*ctal thing It well obtatn'd.
That I*. her love; for that Is all In all
Much as he desires to see Kate married
he assumes that her love, or at least her
consent, must first be gained.
It Is clear, then, that Kate is betrothed
not against her will, though she says
nothing at the time. We are to imagine
her taking Petruchlo'ir hand In a Â«u)kv
sort of way and accepting him thus by
act rather than word. If she had not ac
cepted htm we should not have the
prompt acknowledgment of her father
and the witnesses that the ceremony wan
complete and valid.
The pannage Is a good Illustration of the
necessity In certain cases of reading be
tween the lines of the textâ for the rend
er, I mean, aa distinguished from :b*
spectator In the theater, where the aetft
of course, fills the gap, or should do so'
Here we have only three line* of text
but there Is very Important action be
tween the first two. Petnichlo has tcld

does. "Father ar.d wife, and gentlemen,

the bridal finery. A- he Roes out he adds:
"And kiss ir.e. Kate; we will he married
o' Sunday." If she had not kissed him
we may be sure that IVtruchlo would
have waited until she did. She must Iâ >
tiupposed 10 yield th!s point, though very
likely In the name silent nnd ungracious
way In which she has submitted to the
formalities of the betrothal. The com

to the most degraded taste. The play be
comes a rude and vulgar farce like that
on which Shak:Â«n*Â«-<Â» founded It. but
which he took so much pains to elevata
and refine.
Petruchio s purpose throughout Is to
snow Kate an *>xajjgerat*d nflex of her
self, and to make her fe.Â»l low unreason
able and unworthy such a character Is:
but he does It In a thoroughly good-na
tured way. He share* all the discomfort*
that it brings upon her. and makes it all
apptnr to be done out of love for her. As
she herself says to (.Jrumlo. "He does it
under name of perfect lovÂ«-." and he. In
the soliloquy after he has cheated her out
of h.-r * u P** r " n th Â« n'sht of their arrival
at his house, says:
Ajr. aftd amM thin hurly I Intend
That all ii .1 n- in reveren.l care cf h#r.
Of co.urse. th!s makes the moral lesson
the more impressive and effective. If ha
subjects her to all this privation and dis
appointment and mortlrtcatlon with ob
vious malice she could perhap* nerve her
self to MÂ«ht aÂ«airst it, but when it is dune
ostensibly out of pur<- kindness to her
what can she Fay? Must she not accent
the lesson, that ungovernable fmper arid
unrÂ«aaunable Impatience and overbearing
willfulness, whatever may ho the motlvo
that Inspires or excites th*m, can only re
act disastrously upon the person who
gives way to them? They can only tend
to makÂ» him n]|-Â«-raÂ»i'> Â«â Â« well as every
body about htm. Kate Is compelled to
JÂ«ay to hers. If: "Th'Â« is what I am coming
to if I go on as I have begun; let mo en"
riea\-or to reform myself first, and then
mv husband, for we are a couple of fools "
It Is Interesting to note that on* of the
flrst indications of her better temper Is a
consideration for others rather than her
self. When "Jrumlo Is telling of their rid*
home, he says: "How he b*-at me because
her hors* stumbled, how she wadi-d
through the dirt to pluck him off me"â
which was wonderfully kind under the
circumstance; and later, when Petruchio
berates the servant for spilling the wait
she snys: "Patience. I pray you: 'twas a*
fault unwilling"; and when the meat haÂ«
been thrown at th* heads of those X ..Â»
had brought it. she excuses the mifch
abused cook by telling her husband that
the meat was well enough If he "were Â»o
contented." There Is nothing of all this In
the old ptay.
It is not to he wondered at that now am!
then the old shrewishness reasserts
Itself, especially when Petruchio meddi?*
with her millinery and dressmaking. That
would try the patience of a frmnle saint,
and we cannot expect Kate, who Is far
from being a saint, to endure it tamely. It
Is remarkable, however, that she bears It
as well as she does. Is there a woman
among my readers who would not hay*
scolded worse under similar provocation?
Imagine how the Kate of maldrn day*
would have raved If Bianca or anybody
else had presumed to dictate the size of
her cap or the cut of her gown!

ride." said Miss Ryan, when the affair was being arranged.
"I do not desire to gain notoriety In that manner. I would
like to enjoy the fun and novelty of an actual race* and yet
have my Identity remain unknown. Would I be afraid to
ride? Not a bit of it. 1 have never seen the horse of which
I was afraid. Many a time I have ridden to bounds In the
East, and that is far more dangerous when the chase is fast
than a horse race. It would all he over so quickly that I
don't believe any one would recognize me nor take me for
other than one of the regular jockeys. How strange it will
seem to ride Queen Hess In the stage race on Friday night
after the thrill and excitement of the track race In the after
noon:"
Miss Ryan will ride In either the first or second race of
the day jind will have a mount from one of the most promi
nent stables. Her programme name will bo a llctitious 0n...
and but few will be aware that anything out of the ordinary
is transpiring when the little actress mounts for the race.
It is a â trance coincidence that on Friday night four of the
leading jockeys will appear in the race scene at the Alham
bra, and ride gainst Miss Ryan. These are Tommy Barns,
Joe Piggoit. Henry Spencer and Eddy Jones.

LAST GAME

Oakland Wins Morning and
Afternoon Matches From
the Local Team.
Oakland 4, San FnÂ»nciaco 3.
Full of Interesting features was th*Â» last
game of the California League season of
1899. The name Itself, between San Fran
cisco and Oakland, kept the crowd at Rec
reation Park guessing, and the men played
good ball.
At the fnd of the fourth innln? there
â  hiiitus in the game. President
: walked up to the plate, Iburg trail-
Ing behind. With all soh mnlty the presi
dent of the league beckoned the diamond
scrapers around him and then turned
â¢ the floodgates -.f spi
"In my right hand, gentlemen," he said,
" 1s a medal of fold, studded with a big
diamond. To you, Mr. lb-.ir*r. <iÂ«Â»-s this
munificent offering belong, for you ure
the m>i^t popular player In tlio league.
So says the ballet-box."
â¢ng the n.imn t" the word. .'â¢
delivered the go da Heine Krug, who was
second in â¢ . smiled sadly. His
coupon-cutting Crienda neglected iiim in
the streti-h. and tburg won <->ut. At th-
presentation the play< their heads
and looked r.-.i! funereal. When it was
all over v wild shout rent the Korreation
Park atmosphere, and the gÂ«me con
tinued.
From the sixth to the eighth Innings
til-- game was three all. but Oakland had
a streak of luck and added the last and
winning run of the match, San Francisco
started out welL After making his first
bag by an honest hit Hlldebrand coursed
, the sacks on a succession of wildly lurid
throws on the part of the Dudes. In the
fourth another run was chalked down for
the local team. Rellly swatted the ball
for a hit. stole second and went to third
on Pyne's out. Becoming nervous from
long standing on third, he started to steal
; the plate, which he did without being
"pinched." Ban Francisco's last run was
made by l'vne In the sixth. Going to first
on a hit, be Stole second and scored on
Mullfrs two-bagger.
The fourth Inning netted the Pnirami-ls
three runs. Hammond rapped out a two
bagger, advanced a station on a passed
ball and scored on Donovan's hit to Krug,
! who threw wildly to the plate. Then be
gan some more wild throwing on Dun
leavy's out at first, and Donovan coursed
I the bags. Lange ended the agony of runs
by a hit and a stolen base, scoring on
Schme<Â«r's single.
The winning run was ?>corod in the
eighth by Hammond. Making first on a
bunt, he went to second on Hardle's sacri
fice, scoring on Donovan's hit.
Mosklman and "Josh" K. illy divided
the fielding honors by some sensational
catcheha. In the fifth Inning lburg re
lieved Fireman Fltz. The score Is:

BRYAN AND DEFEAT
A RECEXT VIEW OF THE PO
LITICAL SITUATION.
Well-Known Attorney Cannot See
How the Democracy Can Hope
to Beat McKinley's Re
election.
Attorney George W. tHth. who has
been prominent in the councils of the
People's party In California, has returned
to the city after a two-months' stay In
the East, during which h<? was at 6ome
pains to determine the exact political
situation. He returns with the Impres
sion that McXli and Bryan will again
fight for the Presidency, and thrt Bryan
will again be defeated.
"Bryan and McKlnley." he said, "will
be the nominees again, and I fear thÂ«
same result will obtain. I cannot see
how Bryan will carry a single State Me-
Kinley carried In 1556, saving Maryland.
He will lose Missouri, in all probability,
and possibly Kansas. Bryan might have
won by forcing the fight upon public
ownershipâ* question that would split
the Republican vote in New York. Penn
sylvania. Ohio and Illinoisâ but he has
declared h:mpelf against It, and that will
lose him a million votes. Where can ho
make up that loss much less make any
gain?
"As was GBOe said of the English army,
â¢he Democratic party li a party of lions
I*d by MS McKlnley could never pet
my vote, but I can't see how we can beat
him. unless Dewey will run. and he will
not."

TROUBLE AHEAD FOR
PATROLMAN PHELAN
HE DREW A REVOLVER ON A
SALOON MAN.
Officer. Presumably Intoxicated, En
tered the Richelieu Saloon and
Created a Disturbance.
Charles Newman, proprietor of the
Richelieu snioon. Market and Geary
streets, will file charges this morning with
the Police Commissioners against Police
Officer John Phelan, who. he claim-;.
threatened him early yesterday morning
with a revolver.
Phelan entered Newman's saloon short
ly after midnight and began asking al
most Immediately what had caused the
disturbance he claimed to have heard. He
was told there had been no disturbance,
but he insisted there was. The result was
that Phelan and Newman got into an
argument, during the course of which the
saloon man ordered the officer out of the
house. Phelan refused to go. and New
man then Insisted that he either arrest
somebody or get out. As Phelan con
tinued to talk. Newman crowded him to
the door, where the officer drew his re
volver and threatened the saloon man.
Further trouble was averted by the Inter
ference of spectators.
Phelan went away, hut returned later
and tried to "square" the case with
Newman. He took a drink over the bar
and went on his way rejoicing. At the
time of the first trouble it Is supposed
that Phelan was slightly Intoxicated and
came into thÂ« saloon for no other pur-
Me than to take a drink. When he found
strangers In the place he feared to order
a drink and began to talk disturbance as
an excuse for his presence.
Phelan has often been noted for lack of
tact and evidently Is not ablo to distin
guish between his rlchts and those of a
citizen. He is regarded ns a trouble
breeder along his beat, where he has fre
quently entered saloons and drank at
tbelr expense.

VATICAN WORRIED OVER
ATTITUDE OF FRANCE
Since the Time of Jules Ferry There
Has Not Been So Much Hostil

don Bennett.
KuME, Nov. âThe chief preoccupa
tion at the Vatican at the present mo
ment Is a question of its relations with
France. A: the Apostolic Palace there Is
a Urn belief that the Preach Chamber
will maintain an embassy to the Holy
See. for It Is to the Interest of France to
do so, Dut there is much anxiety in regard '
to other matters.
"You see to what we have come," said
the prelute to one who is In touch with
the Vatican and expresses its anxieties.
â¢"The budget committee has reported for
the suppression or seven bishoprics and ;
the salaries of iW vicars. The Govern- ;
ment is preparing a bill directed against
... lions, the objective of which is :
especially a religious congregation.
â it has adopted a bill almost entirely
suppressing free secondary education In- I
asmuch as it compels orilctals of state to .
pass at least three months in otttclal sec- i
ondary.
"Since the time of Jules Ferry, there j
has not been such an outbreak of hostil

TIMBER LAND WITHDRAWN
FROM THE MARKET
Pupet Sound Lumbermen Now Real
ize That Washington's Fir For
ests Are Not Inexhaustible.
TACOMA, Nov. -â¢"â¢ - Pupet Sound lum
bermen now realize for the first time thai
Washington's fir forests are not Inex
haustible. Great tracts of timber have
been withdrawn from the market during
the past few days. All unsold tracts on
the market are being rapidly purchased
by lumbermen from Minnesota, Wiscon
sin and Michigan, who have only from
two to live years' cuttings left In their
present locations.
The Northern Pacific Railroad has with
drawn all its lands in Western Washing
ton from sale pending transfer to the
Weverhaeuser syndicate of a million acres
in Southwestern Washington. Wisconsin
lumbermen have just purchased 7500 acres
in Skagit and Snohomlsh counties. An
other syndicate has purchased 7000 acres
in Whatcom County. Over a half million
acres of good timber lands are Included
in the Mount Rainier and Olympic forest
reservations. The Northern Pacific has
lust discovered that it cannot secure
lands In the timber belt of this State, and
has commenced making locations in Ore
con and Idaho. One result of these facts
has been to send the prices of both logs
and fir timber land bounding upward.
From this time forward more attention
will be paid to the development of the
State's Immense forests of hemlock and
cedar. The Weyerhaeuser syndicate is
planning to erect a number of mills here
and at Grays Harbor and Wllllpa Harbor.

AIM FOR THE
FIELD BEFORE
FIGHTING ENDS
Forty-Second to Sail
To-Morrow.
OME OFFICER ON THE RACK
BOARD OF INQUIRY ENGAGED
IN SITTING ON HIM.
Last Regiment! in Fear That the
Trouble in the Islands Will
Be Over When They Get
There.
The Forty-second Infantry will have
another day of grace, it wai schedule!
â  â â  to-day, but the date of It* H
Ing has been put off twenty-four
I will not be embarked before t â 
morrow. The only thing the regiment
fears Is that It will not arrive In time to
help in the fighting. With the gum*
away of the Forty-second the last of th*
white regiments under the extension of
the army will have started for the sc-re
of action in the Philippines. There w.ll
be left but the two colored reirtm^rr
the Forty-eighth, now In quarantine at
Angel Island, and the Forty-ninth, await
ing orders to sail, and In the m^antim
camped next the car line and in the Â»IU
volunteer camp.
The Forty-second will aall short a f*w
men and at least one officer, unless tnÂ«
board of Inquiry now sitting upon nn
military capabilities shoulJ rtrrsh It -
In time to let him. There has been mit
one officer of the Forty-secon<l ordÂ»"
for examination, a record rather
creditable than that of other
who at one time or another have ha<l a
good part cf their official line on the car
pet.
There are now at the Presidio seven!
officers from regiments of volunteers that
have passed through the Presidio In 'he
past few weeks who are being delayed
on their way to the firing line until they
have been put through the mil and their
military usefulness has been accurately
determined. The board Is not a hard one.
however, but that does not mean that It
will pass incompetent officers. There are
some who make good officers In the field
to whom the task of keeping their com
pany records straight Is one of hercul-an
magnitude, and there are others wno?Â«
records are correct in every way. but
whosÂ« men are total strangers to d'.-ri
pllne. It Is such officers, as well a* thos*
who can neither command discipline nor
keep their records properly, who are be
ing brought before the board, and i*\Â»
question arises are they good enough one
way to overbalance their shortcomings
In another. It Is a question that lies with
the board.
Reports from the quarantined soldiers
are similar to those of Saturday. There
has been no change in the situation out at
the smallpox detention camp at the Pre
sidio, and "no change" Is the report from
Angel Island. It will be at least ten day*
before the Forty-eighth will gain freedom,
that Is unless more <â¢!Â«â  should develop,
and for safety's sake it may be kept over
there two weeks anyway. It will be ihÂ»
last to leave unless the Forty-ninth shoull
follow Its example and develop a few
cases of Its own. Curiously enough. th*Â»
men of the Forty-ninth regard this m.>rÂ«
to be feared as a means of delay than as
any personal danger to themselves. They
feel if they can only get away they would
not care much, but they don't want any
cases until they have startedâ a position
diametrically opposite to that of the of
ficers of the command and of the sur
geons, both regimental and department.
There Is no fear entertained on their be
half, however, for although the colored
regiments Â«â¢Â« â¢ :â â¢ both recruited over very
much the same territory, while they ren
dezvoused at different points, still th*
Forty-ninth has been long enough In *nÂ«
service to develop any latent ras* that It
might have brought out her** with It. All
It wants now is to get to the Islands In
time to 'do something."
The Forty-second gave a farewell parÂ»d^
on the post drill ground yesterday after
noon. ft Is a fine body of men. well of
ficered and well drilled, and Its nppe.jr
ance on the parade ground did credit to
the command.
Thomas Jones, a private of Company X
of the Forty-ninth Regiment, died at thÂ»
general hospital yesterday. He was taken
to the hospital as soon as the regiment
arrived here, he having contracted pneu
monia while on his way to this coast.
A game of football enlivened matters at
the Presidio Athletic Grounds yesterday
afternoon. It was between a team from
the Hancock School and one from they
Brooklyn Athletic Club. The Brooklyn
Athletic Club won by a score of 30 to 0.
FRAWLEY COMPANY IN
ENGLISH MELODRAMA
"Tbe Sporting Endless" Heartily Ap
planded by a Delighted Audience
at the California Theater.
In these days of dramatic mediocrity It
Is quite refreshing to be entertained with
a genuine melodrama, the briskness of
which regulate* the emotions of the spec
tator. It was Indeed like the good old
times to hear the hero applauded and thÂ«
villain hissed and to follow the action of
the plot, which terminated in the downfall
of the bad and the survival of the good.
It Is the same old story, but a story ever
pleasing to hear.
"The Sporting Duchess" Is not exactly
of the same caliber us the general run
of melodramas. It Is true the villain lay*
his plans to destroy the man who think*
him bis best friend and these very plan*
.ire frustrated Just at the time when they
seem about to prove successful. Tho
beauty of this play Is that it does not be
come coarse or boisterous. it Is a clean
play, wherein brisk situations follow each
other rapidly, intermingled with good
humor that never approaches the danger
ous ground of burlcÂ»<iue. â¢ -
Mr. Krawley has un exceptionally well
balanced company with htm this ttmo.
His women are particularly clever. Mary
Hampton, in the leading role, was suc
cessful In bringing out the claracter of
the part.
There was no mistaking the fact that
the sporting Duchess was a "thorough
bred, that she had a will of her own Â«Â».nri
that beneath a somewhat rough exterior
there was hidden a white soul which it
the right time never failed to assert luclf
Vts. realism and a <iutt-k tonceptlon rrq
the main characteristics or Miss Itar.it
ton's work. The same may ue said of
Mary Van Buren. who*** - villalnnumea*
although despicable In her actions, was
not to.be condemned, but rather pltlÂ«vl
Marion Barney essayed the role of th-i
Countess of Desborough with acceptatu
facility. Her dramatic climaxes wero per.
hapÂ» not quite strongly enough brought
nut. but she appeared to better advantage
In the quieter emotional srenes.
A valuable addition to the company <Â«
I'earl Landers, who proved very n.in^r.,, â 
tory In Ingenue parts. Phe has a fine sonn
of effect, and n*-ver falls 'to extract all
the. humor from the lines allotted to her.
She. together with J. R. Armory, broiis.it
out thÂ« humor of the piece In a dccldodljr
laudatory manner. It irai the work <>t
artists. Harrington Reynolds seemed t )
understand the importance of a villain's
role. lie said his lines calmly, without
unnecessary noise and without rcsortlr â 
to ranting.
The scenery Is very tasteful an<l th me
Ing scene very realistic, that is to say m
far as thÂ»Â» excitement Is concerned. Tne
â¢ttage is somewhat too small to make It
otherwise very Inspiring. In happy con
trast to other melodramas, there Is no
"hallelujah'" about the. villain* downfall
at the end. but he walks quietly off the â¢
Htaxe. with . the vlllalncss by the arm,
'â¢Tile Sportlnc Duchesa" will provo very
profitable to the California Theater.

RIDER AND HORSE
TH.IOWN BY A WAVE
PECULIAR ACCIPENT NEAR THE
CLIFF HOUSE.
Dspew Repeats His Experience of Two
Weeks Ago and Escapes Unin
juredâFun at the Chutes
and Sutro's Baths.
Two accidents, neither of which resulted
seriously, although both presented possi
bilities for a fatality, occurred at the Park
and beach yesterday. A Mr. SefkiÂ© was
riding; along the beach, near the Cliff
House, and finally turned his horse Into
the breakers. For a tine time rider and
steed enjoyed the wash, but suddenly a
big wave rolled In and before the animal
could turn, the force of the breaker dis
lodged Mr. Selklo from his seat and threw
the horse. The receding wave carried
both horse and rider out, but the next In
coming breaker landed both high and dry
on the sand. George Plppy and Attorney
Frenay caught tne horse. Mr. Hefkie
mounted ana rode away to his home un
injured, but with his clothes bulging, with
a cargo of water.
His escape was a molt fortunate one,
for had the horse fallen before he was
washed out of the saddle in all probability
he would have been drowned.
C. W. De] â¢ of 30S San Jose avenue en-
Joyed a repetition of his experience of two
weeks ago. when his horse bolted into the
shrubbery near the music stand, broke
away from the buggy and seriously Injur
ed a police officer before capture. Yes
terday, shortly after 2 o'clock. Mr. Depew
was driving the same horse past the lo
cality of the accident of two weeks ago.
As though it remembered the occurrence
and enjoyed the same, tha horse again
bolted into the shrubbery. The buggy
was overturned and Mr. Dep^w thrown
out. but he escaped injury. Before the
horso could break away Captain Thomp
son had a rope on it and led it to the
stable. Mr. Depew says that the next
time he drives the horse past its favorite
bolting place he will be prepared to give
the animal a surprise that will In a great
measure detract from the pleasure gained
in the breaks of yesterday and two weeks
ago.
Tie crowd at the Park was large yester
day and the driveways and cycle paths
well patronized. The Chutes' programme
was run ofl before a big and merry crowd.
Major Mite continues to be the attraction
at the playgrounds and doubtless will
for some weeks to me.
The pleasant weather resulted In an un
usually large crowd gathering at Sutro
Baths. Following are thÂ« results of the
contests:

piece of work by Dan Ahem, who se
cured a touchdown for the H boys. Atiern
followed up his good work by kicking
the goal. *â¢ â ;. â 
The Cadets shortly after secured an
other touchdown.
The second half of the game was noÂ« as

GEISTING IS GRILLED
BY CONTRACTOR NERNEY
National Guard Blouses De
velop Another Scandal.
Pettibone's Agent Hints That Money Was
Used to Deprive Him of Work for
Which He Was Lowest Bidder.
LIKE Banrjuo's ghost. thÂ« National
Guard blotiss bugaboo refuse* to
refrain from annoying the Govw
nor_ and his staff. When Major
Gelstlng got offended at General
"After Me" Seaman* and tattled to
Gage. It I* hardly likely that hÂ« antici
pated the cndlnss chain of trouble that
was destined to follow. Gristing hinted
It. whispers about "graftlnc" on the uni
form board, and did it in such a manner
as to give, out the Impression that he
thought his colleague. General Dickinson,
wa^ guided In his stand on the blouse
business by improper influences. Now
those who ar<Â» identified with the other
fclde of thÂ« question are doing the talking
and there in nothing t>Â«:ng said in In
audible u>nos. They are shouting their
charges, although shaping them in such
language that tliÂ«*y will be on the safe
tide if it comes right down to a fight.
3t is claimed now that is(X" Is to be di
vided amonx the members of the uniform
board, who arÂ« oppu*<-d to awarding the
contract to Pettibone & Co. of Cincinnati.
It Is al*>o asserted that Governor Gage
haÂ» beÂ«n posted on the "graft." and has
decided to spoil the game by naming two
in-w members on the hoard. Political pull,
it is stated, will do for Pettibnne & Co.
what pome othÂ»-r !..;â¢. rs for blouses at
tempted to do with the pood hard coin.
Captain Thomas A, NVrney of the Naval
Ri-wrve if credited with exercising that
Influence which the Cincinnati firm hopes
will do the most good. Captain Nerney
represents the firm on this coast. Gen
eral Seamans, the real thing from the
(south, favors the P.ttibone contract.
Governor Gage Just dotes on Searaans.
Thus *lt can be seen without looking
through a magnifying glass that Nerney'a
jolt is Â«-asy.
The members of the uniform board who
have not favored the Pettlbrme contracts
are. Colonel Cutler and Major Gristing.
From the :Â»olnt of view of a man up a
tree. It would not appear that they would
hoid their positions long enough to be In
ai the tiiiish of the blouse scandal.
Captain NVrney will not admit that he
Is "wlsÂ« " as to Governor Gagf's determi
nation In the matter, but he says, with
out any attempt to mince his words, that
If t tiÂ«- executive doe* not make a change
In the board he certainly ought toâ not
to much for the good of PettlbonÂ© & Co.
as for the benefit of the National Guard,
lie rxpi<fi"'Â« the hope that when the
change is made men of at least common
renseâ measured by the Nerney lighttâ
\\:;i I>â¢ placed in power. He also drifts
Into BffUPM and mentions much about $si"O
which he claims that the firm that is be
k.c favored could easily afford to pay if
II g.Â«t the blouse contract at the price
stan-d In its bid. Captain Kersey scouts
what he terms the "home Industry sui>Â«
terfuge." :;nd Fays that kind of talk is
all tommyrut.

"Utchneld & Co., who have the con
tract for the caps, are home industry peo

A Co. "Go and ask them If their caps are
made on this coast; go and n-Â«k them If
they are not. being manufactured now In

Captain NVrney thinks that he has been
woefully mistreated i â â¢. the majority of
the uniform board. H. gay* that his bid
for blouses â¢â â -â . centa a blouse less
than that of the firm which is In favor
and he figures ... .# or four
thousand blouses the dlffere.nce would be
considerable.
â¢1 do not know that Governor Gape Is
going to make a change In the uniform
board, but I certainly believe that he
ought to," said Captain NVrney last night
soon after his arrival on board the
Marion, fresh from an El Campo dam
bake. "There Is room for lots of Improve
ment in the personnel of board, and
I sincerely hope that Gage will name
some new men who at least have common
sense and 'who will not openly try to
spend as much of the State' 6 money at
they know how. Pettibone's bid for
blouses is nearly two thousand dollars
loss tharv.Â«hat of the firm that two of the
uniform board are breaking their necks
to favor. General Dickinson ha* acted
like a gentleman throughout the whole
proceedings.
"Now. when members of a board that
is awarding a contract for State supplies
stands out to give it to the highest bid
der we cannot help but suspicion that
some substantial Influence Is being
brought to bear. The favored Urn can
spend $s'Â»o to get the Job and still make
a big profit. Of course J am not In a po
sition to say that this amount is being
expended or that it is being divided among
two members of the uniform board, but I
know a few things that 1 am not telling,
ar.d the people can draw their own con
clusions.
"I ivÂ« no use for Major Gristing. He
does not even know how to act like a
gentleman. He is all swelled up with his
own importance. Brass button?, gilt braid
and a tin sword have made him BO
haughty that an ordinary gentleman can
not approach him. It has bt-Â«>n a mystery
to me that Colonel Cutler who has the
reputation of being a good' fellow, stands
In with the side-whiskered maior.
'"This whole affair has (riven a black
eye to the National Guard, and it will
take It a long time to recover. From the
way things look now it will be months be
fore the Guardsmen will have blouses.
Their trousers and caps will soon be
ready f..r th-m. but think of the show
they will make with regulation trousers
and caps and a Job k.t of coats of every
color, shape and style, picked from their
old wardrobes.
"Of course, as a bidder for some of the
contracts. It would not look well for me
to say much about these things, but I am
think:- a whole lot. and something is
going to i drop .before the people hear the

The police are searching for a footpad
who held up a man named Reynolds at
Geary and Scott streets yesterday morn-
Ing and robbed him of a gold watch and
chain and a small amount of money. Rey
nolds, who Is a clerk in a wholesale house
on Sansome street, was on his way home,
and when passing Hamilton Square he
was suddenly confronted by a "tall" man,
whose face was partially concealed by a
brown slouch hat. Pointing a pistol at
Reynolds" head the robber ordered him
to throw up his bands under the penalty
of being riddled with bullets. Reynolds
quickly obeyed and the footpad proceed
ed to help himself to his valuables and
money.
While the robber was in the act of
searching his victim a hack driver named
Partridge, who was driving along Scott
street, saw him in the act, and ho at once
drove to the O*Farrall Street Station,
where he reported the robbery to tho otll-

but Reynolds was found a short distance
away gasping for breath and bemoaning
his lo6s. He describes the robber as be
1 ing about .-ix feet tall, rather shabbily
dressed and wearing a small .lark mus

CHANUCAH FESTIVAL
SOLEMNLY CELEBRATED
CEREMONIES AT THE DEDICA
TION OF LIGHTS.
Congregation Beth Menachlm Strei
sand Gives an Entertainment in
Aid of Its Building Â£ und.
The Congregation Beth Menachlm
Streisand celebrated the Chanucah Festi
val, or Dedication of I-lgh's. last night
i at Odd Fellows* Hall, with appropriate
ceremonies. The celebration is In com
memoration of the biblical story of the
Maccabees, who came to the Holy Tempi*.
In Jerusalem to find that there was but
a drop of sacred oil left in the sanctuary
| to us.- in lighting the temple. By a mirac
ulous act of Divine Providence the small
! quantity of oil was made to last for eight
nights. The orthodox Jews honor the
providential act every year, both in the
synagogues and in their households, by
lightiug eight candles, one on each night.
lxist nignt the ceremonies consisted of
the lighting of the Brst candle and the
choir of the congregation rendered special
music for the occasion. Otto Irving Wise
delivered an address, in which he urged
his hearers to follow the tradition;; and
customs of their ancestors and to remain
true to their ancient faith. He congratu
lated the Jewish race on living in Amer
ica, where a Jew could worship as he
willed and where be was accorded the
same rights under the free Institutions of
this nation.
The entertainment was given In aid of
the building fund of the congregation and
realised a handsome sum. It is the In
tention to remove the synagogue from its
present quarters on Minna street and to
erect a line edifice on one of the .main
streets In the southern section of the
city.
The programme was as follow*:
Dedication of lights. Cantor H. Samuelson:

GRAVE OUTLOOK

Still Blowing a Heavy
Southeaster.
COLUMBIA TEN HOURS LATE
RAN INTO A HURRICANE OFF
THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
â¢
Fears That Many of the Overdues
Will Be Short of Provisions.
Some of Them Have Been
So Reported.
â¦
The routheast storm that has raged
along the coast for over â  month has
not by any means blown Itself out. In
mâ¢â¢ail. it m cmi to have gathered fresh
force, and according to th.- tfÃcera of the
steamer Columbia is now blowing a hur
ricane off the Columbia River. In conse
quence the steamer was ten hours late
and not one of the passengers but
was glad when the Golden <;..â¢â¢â  was
reached. A very large fleet of coasters
li now overdue, and from the weather re
port of the Columbia It looks as though
it will be several days before any of them
reach port.
The ship Spartan, now thirty days out
from Seattle, was spoken on the Hist inst.
by the transport Belgian King 100 miles
off port. The schooner American Oirl has !
not been heard from since she left here 1
on October I last for the Sound. The
Ferris S. Thompson was spoken to the
north of Flattery several weeks ago all
well, and the Highland Light was also
spoken with her rudder gone. The Chal
lenger was spoken by the steamer Al
bion and the Amethyst by the steamer
Columbia and supplied with provisions,
while the anxiously looked for Wawona
Is safe at Bantield Sound. A tug has
been sent after her.
â¢ >: the overdues the schooner Albion Is
now out twÂ«nty-nix days from Coquille
River: the ship America twenty-six days
and the Spartan thirty days from Seat
tle; the schooners Amethyst thirty-nine,
Ralph J. Long twenty-seven and S. Dan
lelaon thirty-nine days from Tlllamook;
the schooners Belle and Nettle Sundborg
twenty-two days from Buislaw; the
schooners C. T. Hill twenty-two, Emma
Utter twenty-two, Enterprise twenty-live.
Glen. Twilight and "Wing and Wing
twenty-two days from Grays Harbor;
schooner Challenger thirty-eight days
from Tacoma and barkentlne J. M. Grif
fith twenty-three days from Port Had
lock. All of them have probably been
driven off shore and the only fear Is that
some of them may be short of provisions.
Captain I>"rnn of the Columbia says he
did not see a coaster during the run down
the coast, and that fact adds to the be
lief thai the entire overdue fleet Is well
out to sea.
There are some grave fears for the old
bark Coluaa, now out thirty-seven davg
from Kahulul for Departure Hay. She
was ashore on a coral reef and lost her
forefoot, besfdes being otherwise dam
aged. She was not repaired at Honolulu,
but was sent to the Sound In ballast for
an overhauling. It Is thought that the
vessel seen floating bottom up oft Flat
tery was the old Colusa.
The only arrivals yesterday were the
steamers Columbia. Sequoia, Cleone and
Orizaba. The Sequoia put In to land some
passengers and then proceeded to San
Pedro. The Samoa. Ban Pedro; North
Fork and Weeott from Eureka; the Port
land from the Columbia River; Aberdeen
from Astoria; Progreso from Tacoma
and Homer from Com Hay were all due
yesterday, but some of them are barbound
and the others will probably be In some
time to-day.
There was very little excitement on the
front yesterday. A number of people vis
ited the lowa during the day. as It was
the last Sunday she will be In port for a
long time.
The only sailing vessel reported during
the day was made out to be a bark along
toward dark. The general Impression was
that she would prove to be the S. C Al
len from Honolulu.
