CARS WRECKED
AND BURNED AT
LACKAWANNA
Engineers of Two Trains Are
Killed and Fate of Many
Passengers in Doubt.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
ELMIRA, X. V., July 29. â At 11 o'clock to-night the Erie
passenger vestibuled train No. 7 for Buffalo and Cleve
land, leaving New York at 7 o'clock, was wrecked and
burned at Lackawanra, only two cars escaping the flames. The
train consisted of a buffet car, two passenger coaches and two
Pullman cars. The wreck occurred during a storm which caused
a landslide.
A freight train was first wrecked and the passenger train
plunged into the freight wreck. Both engineers were killed,
but no information about the passengers on train No. 7 is ob
tainable. It is usually a well-filled train in both regular and
sleeping coaches.
The ill-fated passenger train passed Port Jen-is at 10:25 p.
m. and half an hour later was a burning heap. Nothing is known
about the passengers, but in each sleeper for Buffalo and Cleve
land are at least a dozen passengers.
ii the darkness of to-night's storm work at the wreck is
slow and but little will be known until daylight. Xo Erie train
from Xew York will be likely to reach here until late on Sunday.
Extra Erie train Xo. 3 will be made up at Susquehanna. Pa.,
getting to Buffalo at near noon to-morrow. Trains from Xew
ork after 7 o'clock are stopped by the wreck.
A heavy storm prevailed on the Delaware division all day
I a heavy landslide resulted late to-night. The engine, bag
. je car, combination baggage and cafe car and one coach were
surely burned. Stanton Outwater and Timothy Welsh of Port
Jems were the engineer and conductor. There is reason to be
lieve that the Pullman cars for Buffalo and Cleveland were not
oyed and that their c !eeping passengers are safe.
All telegraph lines at the scene of the wreck arc down.
ENGLAND PREPARING FOR

NEW YORK. July 23.â A World cable J

ANOTHER ADVANCE IN

MINNEAPOLIS, July 29.- Th* Tirm?
will say to-morrow: Lumber v.ill advance
another .71 cents straight on Monday, this
being the fifth marked advance In price.
It has been many years sln<-e there was
such a demand as the present Beason has
shown, and even with the advancing
prices the demand continues to exceed the
supply. In the case of the elevator build
ers, who are using "crlhbing"' In .creat

have to resort either to the higher grade
cribbing, which is almost 100 expensive
for the purpose, or take to steel for ele

Henry Maret presided at the banquet
and introduced as the first speaker
Mayor Phe'.an, who delivered a well
chosen address, welcoming the turners
to the city and complimenting them on
the benefits derived from an nrganzia
ti"n like theirs, and suggesting that
much of the success of our gunners in
the late war with Spain was due to
following tin' example set by the tur
ner societies in the I'nited States in
practicing marksmanship. The Mayor's
remarks were vigorously applauded,
and when he took his seat he was given

FUROR CAUSED
BY DEWEY'S TALK
Admiral's Statement That Our
Next War Will Be With Ger
many Is Criticized.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, July 29.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: Official circles
were considerably upset to-day
by the interview published in the
Herald this morning with Admiral
Dewey at Trieste, in which serious reÂ»
flections are made upon Germary, and
the statement attributed to him that
our next war will he with that coun
try.
Although there is enough in tho offi
cial repents made by Admiral Dewey
while in the Philippines to bear out the
observations reported in tho interview,
both Secretary Hay and Secretary Long
insist that there must be some mistake.
They cannot believe that Admiral
Dewey. who has been so discreet in all
of his public utterances up to this time,
would comment so boldly about inter
national affairs, especially while he is
passing through a European port.
There is no doubt that Admiral Dewey
was suspicious of German Interference
for some time after he first took hold
of affairs in the Philippines. His offi-
cial dispatches puhlished at tho time
and since dearly indicated this. Hut
\b? authorities insist thai a decidedly
bettor leelinp now exists between this
country and Germany, and that Ad
miral Dewey, knowing the desire "f the
administration to encourage this spirit,
would not Intentionally say or do any
thing to promote discord.
ThÂ« rail of the German Minister, Mr.
vnn Mumra, ai the State Department
this morning: gave rise to the report
that ho had come to make some repre
sentation to Secretary Hay concerning
the Interview. "Wh'-n l ask'd Secre
tary Hay, he declared that it was not
true: that the Minister had called upon
an entirely different matter, and that
the Dewey Interview was not men
tioned. He said that no official action
had been taken by the department and
that none would ho, certainly for the
present, for he. could not believe that
Admiral Dewey had been correctly
quoted.
"I am satisfied there must h" som"
mistake," said Secretary Long. "Ad
miral Dewey-could never have made
the statement attributed to him I feel
quite sure. Then I do not see that there
can be any official attention Riven to
the matter."
Minister yon Mumm declined to dis
cuss the Dewey interview in any way.
A member of the diplomatic corps
with whom I discussed the matter Bald:
"My opinion is that the German
Governent will not take any official no
tire of the interview which Admiral
Dewey save to the Herald correspond
ent at Trieste. It differs very mate
rially from the utterances of Captain
Ooghlan, of which the German Govern
ment complained. In this instance Ad
miral Dewey has simply expressed an
opinion. The Herman Government and
the German people and the people of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Admiral Dewey's country, as well, may
regret that the admiral entertains such
an opinion, hut I do not see that the
German Government would be justified
in taking any action."
DEWEY IS SAID TO
DENY THE INTERVIEW
NEW YORK, July 29.â A World ca
i hi" from Trieste pays: Admiral Dewey
read the alleged interview printed
yesterday, In which he is made to say:
; "Our next war will bo with Germany."
Then he said: "I have no time to
read, l^t alone affirm or deny all the
li<s ami irresponsible rubbish which
have been printed about me since my
arrival In Trieste."
Admiral Dewey says he Is on the.
mrrft friendly terms with Prime Henry
of Prussia, who succeeded Yon Died
richs ;is commander in chief of the Ger
man fleet in Chinese waters.
EDITORIAL OPINIONS ON
THE DEWEY INTERVIEW
NEW YORK, July 29.â The Herald
has received the following editorial
opinions on the Dewey interview:
Chicago Evening Postâ Brevity is the
soul of wit, but amplification and quallfl
catlon arc conditions of a right under
; founding. 'Die context of the admiral's
. statements, one feels surf, if intelligently
supplied would take the apparent sting
out of them. What the admiral was led
to observe was, we infer, something Ilka
thisâ that while the United States was at
peace with every European nation and
had no reason to anticipate trouble, fric
tion In the future was mure likHy to oc
cur in relations with Germany than in
those with Great Britain or any other
power.
The Tribuneâ Unless Admiral Dewcy has
gone crazy he has said nothing of the
BOrt. It is true that his relations with th*
German Admiral yon Diederichs were not
! as pleasant as those with the commander
â of the British naval forces. It may he
i that in his heart he believes that England
: is "the natural ally" of the United States.
St. Paul Globeâ Admiral Dewey, never
having been guilty since the battle of
i Manila Bay of conversing through his
chapeau, the Globe will refuse for the
i present to believe that the chief officer of
i the American navy has said our next war
i will be with Germany.
The Yolks Zeitungâ The correspondent
who has telegraphed from Trieste that
Admiral Dewy has said America's next.
war will be with Germany has not even
learned to lie plausibly.
PhiladelphiaKvening Bulletinâ This kind
of talk does not comport with the general
'â â  understanding of Dewey's good sense and
â  his sense of official proprieties of his pro
fession. It is not at all unlikely that, he
s.iid it. but he probably never thought
that it was going to rind its way into
G-rman Gazette-Certainly Admiral
Dewey has not said this, or anything sim
ilar to it. The whole country has so far
admired the admiral for his diplomatic
silence, and we doubt that he has broken
! this silence.
Sonntags Journalâ We don't bolievfi
Admiral Dewey was correctly quoted, and
! if he was he is in error as to the policy
i of Germany.
Kdito.- Tagehlatt, Socialist organâ l
i hardly believe Admiral Dewey said there
'â  will be a war with Germany. There Is no
i reason fur such a war. The massing oÂ£
German warships In Manila Bay during
the. late war was certainly a. foolish act,
calculated to irritate the people of the
[Tnited States. It was entirely the auction
of the Emperor, who is a very rash young
man.
Milwaukee Journalâ Dewey is not a fool.
: ami 30 never said any such thing. Ger
many wants no war with us.
Editor Wastllche Post. Si. T.ouisâ l am
convinced that the Interview doeg not
represent the real sentiments of Dewey.
I am Inclined to believe that unless
Dewey'a denial follows .lose on the pub
â  Ucation of the Interview serious result.-;
i will follow-. There will he every r
to believe thai the interview was in
spired by the state authorities, and that
They have followed the advice of the Eng
lish and concluded to have war with Ger-
Post-Pispatchâ lf it is true that Admiral
Dewey has predicted that our next war
will be with Germany it is much to h<*
regretted. Such an utterance from bo
popular a hero encouragÂ«s the war spirit,
which is generally all too active In every
pail Of the world.

DEPEND UPON UNCLE
SAM FOR PROTECTION
WASHINGTON, July 20.â Upon in
quiry at the State and Navy depart
ments to-day I was informed that
i â  lth< r Germany nor any other foreign
power, as far as is known, has dis
patched a vessel to San Domingo. This
is very gratifying to the authorities, for
although i!" Ejection could be made to
any foreign power having a man-of
war in these waters to proteCl its citi
zen? in the event of a revolution they
upon the absence of euch \
n indication that other countries
itisfled to depend upon the United
S to look after foreign interests in
case of an uprising.
many, I am told, has nut a single
of-war on this station, her North
Atlantic squadron having recently been
withdrawn t> participate In the au
tumn maneuvers at Kiel. It was st.-iU'<l
that a vessel was to be
â  to Guatemala t" demand the pay
ment of debts due to certain German
ts, but the Navy Department has
â¢een informed of lv-r departure.
The only possible fear of any undue
rence in affairs in San
Domingo has been from Germany. It
is known that she has some interests
- i, and it has been stated
that some of the Herman residents are
in sympathy with Jiminez, who is said
*â¢â  !Â»â  heading a movement antagonistic
to ;i legitimate successor of Heureaux.
Whi . 3e, keeping a careful
that there is no foreign
interference, the immediate work of the
two men-of-war to be sent to San Do
mingo will be to protect American citi
zens. If n< cessary marines will be land
ed to protect the American consulate
and American property. The moral ef
; sr-nce of these ships
will, the authorities hope, be .sufficient
to put a damper on any revolutionary
movements. Secretary Lons; said to

MEASURES TO REPEL
POSSIBLE ATTACKS
PORT DE FRAXCE, Island of Mar
tinique, July 29. â Tranquility prevails
at Monte Cristo, but all the people are
anxiously awaiting the important
events which it is expected will occur
shortly.
Genera] Picharde, the Governor of
the city, has taken all possible meas
ures to repel any attack which may be
made by the followers of Senor Juan
Jiminez, one of the candidates for the
1 'residency of the republic.
It i? said that General Picharde has
advised the Government to issue a de
cide proclaiming amnesty for all Do
minican exiles, with a view to appeas
ing the people.
At Labega Keal General Don Pedro
Bobea has taken steps to suppress out
breaks should any occur.
Ip to the present time perfect order
has li">-n maintained, but notwith
standing that fact all law abiding cit
izens have been called upon to bear
arms and hold themselves in immedi
ate readiness for service.
At Hoca, where the people criticize
harshly the laxity of the Governor,
General Juan Gonznles, many versions
are in circulation regarding- the killing
of the President. One has it that the
assassin shot him with the muzzle of
the weapon held close to Heureaux's
breast, crying as he fired the fatal
shots: "Ah, tyran, tv nest tpas digne
de gouverner plus longtemps." (Ah,
tyrant, you are not worthy to govern
longer.)
Almost before the words were ottered
the President feil as if struck by light
ning with a bullet through his heart.
Other accounts say the President \vas
stricken by several bullets and that the
assassins made their escape on horses,
which had been provided and were held
, in readiness for them by friends.
General Pedro Pepil, the Governor of
Santiago, is acting with the utmost en
: ergy and has succeeded in overawing
the enemies of the Government. The
. greatest quiet reigns throughout the
city.
The population of Porto Plata are
; convinced that the grave events that
| have occurred are due to incessant agi
tation. It is known that Jiminez and
his partisans will not delay, but intend
to disembark either at Porto Plata or
I Monte Cristo.
Jiminez is not a popular candidate
I for the Presidency, as it is believed he
! would ruin the country in the course
of time and desires simply to make a
'â  fortune for himself and enrich his fam
: ily and friends.
It is said that the Governors of all
! the provinces are disposed to energet
! ically defend the existing Government.
The merchants of Porto Plata have
held a meeting and decided to continue
to accept the paper money of the coun
: try for a period of thirty days.
Summing up the situation, it may be
1 said that a majority of the people seem
â  to be" favorable to the present Govern
; ment.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., STJKPAY, JULY 30, 1899.
ENGLISH VIEWS ON THE
BOUNDARY CONTROVERSY
Pyramid Harbor, Lynn Canal, Alaska, With the British Warship
Pheasant in the Foreground.
PYRAMID harbor, while formerly not often spoken of, or nearly so -well known as Dyea, and Skaguay, a little
farther to the north on the shorter and more popular routes to the Klondike, has lately become a place of
much importance. It lies on the western side of Chilkat Inlet, just above its mouth, about five miles below
Haines Mission on the other side. Since the summer of 1897 it has been the starting point for parties driving
cattle into the Klondike over the Dalton .trail, which follows the Chilkat River as far as the boundary line,
and since the discovery of gold on Porcupine Creek, a branch of the Klaheena River, which flows into the head of
Chilkat Inlet, it has become the landing place for parties bound thither. A fair road has been opened from Pyramid
to Porcupine City, with branches leading to other mining camps in the district, as well as to the station of the Ca
nadian mounted police, which has been for some months established about three miles above Porcupine City and
some thirty miles inside of the boundary line claimed by the United States. The presence of these police, and their
interference with the location of claims in this vicinity, has more than once threatened to lead to bloodshed.
Pyramid harbor If the natural terminus for the most feasible all-rail route from deep water to the Klondike,
which would nearly follow the Dalton trail to the Yukon below Fort Selkirk, which doubtless explains Canada's earn
est desire for its possession.
Copyrlghted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON*, July 29.â The Alaskan
, boundary dispute again looms large
i in the newspapers and a heated dis
cussion is raging for and against the
last suggestion that a harbor should be
leased to Canada. The official view
j seems to favor this compromise as a
' general basis for a friendly arrange
! ment. It is pointed out that as the
j United States. Canada and Great Brit
! am have to live as neighbors and in
. their hearts desire to live as friends,
neither side can afford to assume a non
possumus attitude or act as if it was
j the last transaction to be arranged, and
I as the main question' at issue, though
almost lost to view among the multi
| tude of irritating side issues, was a
means of ea^y access to the Klondike,
j the lease of a harbor would seem to be
| the practical need of Canada.
On the other hand the Saturday Re
view voices the feeling of a considera
: ble section of the people in pointing
out that by accepting the suggested set
i tlement Canada debars herself from
| again raising the question of territo
| rial right and becomes a mere licensee
I where she claims to be the owner in fee

| promise would lead to endless compli
FUROR CAUSED
By DEWEY'S TALK
Continued from First Page.
I Dewey in his cabin on board the Olym
pia I could not help remarking how
much better he was looking, how much
clearer was his complexion and how
! much brighter was his expression. At
this he seemed pleased and said:
"I go ashore nearly every day for
walking or driving exercise. It is hard
for me to walk, as I have been so long
leading a rather sedentary life on board
ship, and especially under the unfavor
i able climatic intluences of Manila. I
walk about the deck a great deal and
am gradually getting back my powers
of locomotion and will soon try and
manage the hills."
He said he was doing very well, but
â  still felt that he was not fully and en
\ tirely right as regards his digestive
troubles. After referring to dinners in
general, he seemed a little uneasy about
! his ability to dodge banquets in New
i York and Washington on his return
' home. Touching the grand ovation that
is awaiting him, he said:
"It will last about two days. Then
I I shall go t^o Washington immediately
'and see the President and receive the
i sword that is to be presented to me.
I After that I shall be free to go to the
â  mountains or to the country, where I

BULLS IN A DUEL.
Stubborn Combat Ending in the
Death of One of the Animals.
SAN RAFAEL, July 20.â James Welch,
a farmhand employed on the Fitzgerald
place, near Ranier, witnessed last Thurs
day one of the most desperate conflicts
between two maddened animals ever be
held by human eyes. A large bull owned
by a dairyman of the vicinity broke down
a fence and wandered into an adjoining
pasture in which was another bull. The
second animal caught siwht of the In
truder and rushed at him just as Welch,
who was returning home from work,
reached an eminence where he coul i wit
ness the contest.
For thirty minutes the beasts gored
eacb other and the clashing of their horns
could have been heard a quarter of a
mile, while their angry bellowing was
blood-curdling. Finally one fell .x
--hausted to the ground. Welch then ran
for assistance to stop the battle. Before
he returned the fallen animal had been
killed by its foe. The survivor was badiy
injured. One eye had been gouged out, his
flank had been ripped open and the left
horn broken off at the base. The Injuries
are such that the conqueror may die.
Big Mortgage Filed.
VIPALJA, July 29.â The biggest mort
gage ever recorded In Tulare County was
tiled in the Recorder's office this morn
ing. The amount was $101,000. and it was
a loan from the German Savings and
Txian Society of San Francisco to C. N.
Whitmore and wife of Modesto. The
mortgage covers two section? of land in
Tulare County. It required' sso worth of
revenue stamps.
Sweeney's Body Not Recovered.
REDDING, July 29.â The body of Frank
IT. Sweeney, the young reporter on the
Morning Searchlight, who was drowned
on Friday afternoon, has not yet been
recovered. At daybreak a party of men
went down the Sacramento River four

The Saturday Review thinks Canada
ought in no event to surrender her
rights in international law unless she
concurrently receives considerable con
cessions from the United States on
other questions before the commission
ers.
The Saturday Review proceeds to
claim that Canada now suffices for her
self both politically and economically
and has no further need of the United
States, that only the most factious pol
icy on the part of Great Britain could
revive the annexationist party in Can
ada and asks what possible reason the
Canadians could have for Involving
the country in the gravest international
questions. The article concludes as fol

M'KINLEY RESTING
AT PLATTSBURG
The Health of Mrs. McKinley Im
proving, but She Is Still
Very Weak.
PLATTSBURG. July 29.â President Mc-
Kinley's first caller this morning was
George Curtis Treadwell. Governor Roose
velt's military secretary, who bore a mes
sage from the Governor bidding the Pres
ident welcome to New York State. The
President spent most of the forenoon In.
reading the newspapers and in attending
to his correspondence.
Mrs. McKinley was feeling stronger
than she did yesterday afternoon. After
luncheon a two-seated carriage was
brought up with a driver and the Presi
dent and his wife took a short drive
around the hotel grounds. The drive
proved too much for Mrs. MoKinley, how
ever, and they returned to the hotel in.
less than hair an hour. The President
.i-sist-.d by Secretary Cortelyou, helped
Mrs. McKinley from the carriage to a
wheel chair, in which she was wheeled
to her apartments.
The President and Mrs. McKinley both
expressed their sorrow upon learning of
the deaths of two members of the Twenty
first Regiment, which was in the thick of
the fighting in the last battle near Man
ila. The Twenty-first Regiment was sta
tioned at Plattsburg Barracks two years
ago while the President was here, and
each morning a guard mount was held on
the lawn in front of the hotel, after which
they were reviewed by the President. Mrs.
McKinley gave the regiment a handsome
silk flag, which they carried all through
the Santiago campaign, and which they
are now defending in the Philippines. The
regiment came to be known as the Presi
dent's Own. and both he and Mrs. McKin
ley take a special interest in the regi
ment's movements.

SIXTEEN AGREE
TO ARBITRATE
Last Session of Peace
Conference.
LETTER FROM THE POPE
HE GIVES PKOMISE OF HEARTY
CO-OPERATION.
Baron de Staal, in the Closing- Ad
dress, Said That if the Work
Was Not Complete It Was
Wise and Practicable.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE, July 29.â The Interna
tiona! Peace Conference met for its final
Bitting to-day, when it sva& announced
that sixteen states had signed the arbi
tration, convention, fifteen thÂ§ other
two conventions, seventeen the dec
laration prohibiting the throwing
of projectiles or explosives from
balloons, sixteen the declaration prohibit
ing the use of asphyxiating gases and fif
teen the declaration prohibiting the use
of expansive bullets.
A letter was read from the Queen of
Holland to the Pope, asking his moral
support of the conference. The Pope's
reply, which was read, promised co-opera
tion and recalled the fact that he had
many times performed the function of ar
bitrator and assured her Majesty that, in
spite of his present abnormal position,
the Pope would continue to seek the ad
vancement-of civilization.
Baron de Staal delivered the farewell
address, thanking the representatives of
foreign states. He said the work accom
plished, while not so complete as might
be desired was sincere, wise and prac
ticable. The great principles of the sov
ereignty of individual states and interna
tional solidarity, apparently so opposing,
had been reconciled by what they had ac
complished. He affirmed that in time to
come institutions which had their origin
In the need of concord would be the dom
inating influence and that thus the work
of the conference was truly meritorious.
Minister Esteurnelles and Dr. Beaufort
followed, the latter saying that if the con
ference had not realized Utopian dreams
nevertheless it had disproved pessimistic
forebodings, and the mofal effect would
more and more influence public opinion
and aid governments to solve the question
of the limitation of armaments, which
still remains a source of grave considera
tion for statesmen of all countries.
Baron de Staal then declared the con
ference closed.^

The inquest did not result in bring
ing out any clew. Fear of the assas
sins' vengeance has kept the neighbors
from talking. A near neighbor was
told by Stegemeyer that he feared Dan
iel Webster Dean more than any other
person in the neighborhood. Dean was
one of the lads suspected by the offi
cers, but his mother swore that at the
time of the murder he was with her,
gathering hazel nuts. The witnesses at
the inquest were reticent and no doubt
did not tell all they knew.
District Attorney Cooper believes the
old saying "Murder will out" will come
true in this case. Many pertinent facts
were developed at the inquest and no
doubt will prove of value later. As
already related, the murdered man was
g-enerally disliked in his neighborhood.
He daily expressed the fear that he
would be assassinated. He declared

McGuinness from his wheel. jumped upon
him and brutally kicked him. When he
was knocked from the wheel McGuinness
struck on his head and was rendered al
most unconscious. Foster, however. k!ck< d

but he disliked the thought of being
murdered from ambush without a
chance to defend himself.
The officers in charge of the case be
lieve they have discovered the spot
from which the fatal shot was fired. It
is a tall, dead redwood tree, eighty and
three-quarter yards from the dwelling,
on the porch of which Stegemeyer met
death. A rail fence which encloses a
pasture is built up to either side of the
tree, and behind this two persons could
easily conceal themselves. From the
right side of this tree the angle was
right for the shot that missed Stege
meyer's head a few inches.

SANTA ROSA, July 29.â Mrs. Mamie
Shank, the woman who was brutally at
tacked by a tramp at a woodchoppers'
camp near Windsor several days ago, la
dying. During last night and the greater
part of to-day she has been in convul
sions, and there is little hope for her re
covery. Mrs. Shank was left by her as
sailant bound and gagged on the floor of
a tent, and remained in this condition
forÂ» many hours, until the men of tho
camp returned at night from their Labors.
The mental agony she endured has had
much to do with her precarious conditi m.
The sad state of the woman has Increased
the rage of the residents of Windsor and j
vicinity, and should her assailant be cn> j
tured it is almost certain an attempt i
would be made to lynch him.
Although every possible effort has been j
made to locate the culprit all have so tar
proved unavailing. Deputy Sheriffs Wai
ter Poole, J. S. Gist and George W. Lewis
have searched the hills in ttiat vicinity,
but not a person has been found who re- ;
members having seen a man answering
the description of the tramp. Jfesterday
Constable Ohm of Sonoma, one of the
most successful peace officers in the
State received word that a man closely
tallying with the description had beeti
seen making his way across the Calistoga
Hills in the direction of Kapa. Hurrying
in that direction he and a companion
searched all night, but without result.
Sheriff Grace and the Deputy District At
torney drove late this afternoon to the
Leslie ranch, where the assault was com- ,
mitted. It is understood they have a new i
clew, but Dnder Sheriff Austin refuses to
talk of the matter. l.'p to a late hour
nothing: had been heard from either
Grace or Berry.
A well known resident of Windsor said
here this afternoon that if the man re- i
Bponsible for Mrs. Shank's condition were
caught in that vicinity the citizens would
undoubtedly lynch him.

New Design.
PORTLAND. Or.. July 29.â The torpedo
boat destroyerGoldsborough was launched
this afternoon from the ways at the yards
of her builders, the Wolff & Sewlcker Iron
Works. All the auxiliary machinery and
the condenser were aboard the vessel
when launched, and the engines and boil

put In next week.
The contract speed of the Goldshorough
is thirty knots an hour, and this she must
maintain '<>r two consecutive hours. The
length of the Goldsborugh is 198 feet over
all. Her beam is twenty feet at the water
edly and caused us to make many stops
of a quarter or half hour. Outside of
this the motor worked perfectly and
brought us here in two and a half
hours, a distance of thirty-two miles.
We had to make many stops in leaving
Syracuse, for friends made during our
stay asked a chance to photograph the
transcontinental motor. We were
snapped many times before reaching
Tates, where we had luncheon. A big
crowd acted as escort as far as Ca
millus Hill, which, as usual, was to
stall us and compel the use of horses,
but they tolled up the steep grade,
pushing their wheels to no purpose.
We made the mile easily. The roads
are improving, but are yet far from
perfect. We stopped here for the
night that we might get a chance to
go over the motor and tighten up dur
ing daylight. We start at 6 o'clock to
morrow morning, and should go past

YOUNG MORGAN'S
SLAYER CHARGED
WITH MURDER
Unwarranted Killing of the Re
form School Lad Bitterly
Denounced.
/~> ACRAMENTO, July 29.â District
L Attorney Baker this afternoon
S- charging James
c Fames
V ) Kelly with the '"rime, of murder,
and his examination has been set
by Justice of the Peace Henry for Fri
day n-^xt. Kelly and Major R. M. Blair,
military instructor at the Preston
School of Industry at lone, have been
held accountable by a Coroner's jury
for the d^ath "f 17-year-old Joseph
Morgan, the remormatory escape who
was shot and killed at Sheldon yester
day afternoon. It is not probable that
any complaint will be lodged against
Blair, at least until the examination
of Kelly reveais the responsible party.
The killing of young Morgan is de
nounced on all sides as entirely un
called for, and the expressions of indig-
nation are general and severe. This
rooming's Call related the substantial
farts of the tragedy. Morgan and a
companion named Slminoff escaped
from the Preston School. They were
seen in the vicinity of Sheldon, this
county, and Maj^r Raphael Blair and
H. h" Budd, attaches of the institu
tion, were sent after them. At Sheldon
they were reinforced by James Kelly.
James Carroll and a dog. They started
out to explore the fields and were re
warded by seeing Morgan and Siminoff
rise from a haystack ar.d run away.
These four mer. and their dog appar
ently were not ab':e to cope with two
boys, for, after Simmoff had been taken.
Major Blair's revolver and James
Kei'iy's rifle were called into service to
brink the 17-year-old monster to a
standstill. Blair asserts that he shot
twice into the air: Kelly claims he was
given orders to fire his rifle, and that
in doing so he did not aim at the flee
ing toy. From pistoi ar.d rifle five
shots were fired in. all, and when the
bombardment ended the young iad lay
among the grain stalks, dead, with the
blood pouring out of a hole through h'.s
lungs. The party removed their con
quest, living and dead, to Sheldon and
thence to Elk Grove, where the inquest
was held.
The country people were thrown :ntrÂ»
a state of excitement by the occur
rence, and the prevailing sentiment
was one of condemnation of the act.
The unfairness of the combat be
tween four men. some of them armed.
and a defenseless boy, is made the more
shameful when the fact is related that
young Morgan, when shot, was handi
capped with two pairs of handcuffs.
One of them, broken, hung from his
wrist, while another was on hia arm.
When Morgan escaped from the school
his' hands were tied together.
At the inquest yesterday afternoon
Kelly said:
â "They told me to stop him ar.d I
fired. I did not fire to hit him. I took
no deliberate aim when I fired. In the
meantime Blair fired one shot."
Louis Simir.off. who escaped with
Morgan; said at the inquest that he
had known Morgan about fifteen or six
teen days and had been associated with
him for three or four days. Said he:
CATHOLIC RESORT
ON THE SACRAMENTO
Beautiful Site Near Shasta Retreat j
Turned Over to the
Clergy.
REDDIXG. July 29.â The Methodise re
sort in the Sacramento Canyon, known as
Shasta Retreat, is to have a friendly rival
under the ownership and control of Cath
olics. The fine property at the mouth of
Hedge Creek, close to Shasta Rttroat,
owned by Rev. Father Quinn. has been
turned over to the Catholic clergy of thla
diocese a-.d it is to be 3; ted up as an ideal
resort for people of that faith- Repairs
have been made to the buildings a. ready
on the grounds, and negotiations jare now
pending for some adfiir.or.al sar:d, wnlcn
will be subdivided and told for cottage
lots and camp sites.
\ year or so ago the Methodist fotÂ«c
took an option to purchase Father
Quinn* s property, but for some reason
the deal could not be consummated. When
tb* option expired the plan was suggcste-i
that the Catholic clergy procure the prop
erty for a sectarian retreat. The repairs
and improvements made this year are
only the beginning of a resort that will
eventually attract Catholics from aii over
the State", as it is located in an ideal re
gfon ar-d is of itself an ideal spot.
A. portion of the land will serve as a
summer home for the Sisters of Mercy
and another subdivision for young Cath
olic brothers. Quite a colony is now on
the ground and more are arriving. N-x-.
year accommodations will be prepared for
a large influx.

REDWOOD CITY. July 25.â Another let-

treated in this cour.tr>-. I am still a
prisoner in the same old cell; notwith
standing I have received a reply to my
statement from Washington telling
me that the Embassador at Mexico
City had teen instructed to Investi
gate my case and send his findings to*
the Stal Department at Washington:
Although I received this -letter seven
days a^o no or.c of them has yet put
in an appearance. It seems a very hard
matter to get Clayton to take any
action in this, although he is ordered
to do so.
I am very thank! to you for the
interest you have taken in my case,
and also" for any other fa% - ors that
you may do me in trying to get me
released from this prison. I am ?ick
and this prison is killing me. for I
am now unable to star.d on my feet. I
am doing- everything I can to get out.
and my friends are doing all in their
power to have me released. This
trouble has cost me over a thousand
dollars, and I am not out yet, but I
do not want foi anything so far as
money is concerned, for I have some
little rr.oney left yet and I have friends
who have plenty of it and will spend
it to pet me out of here. But that does
me no pood. What I need is influence
at Washington to unlock these pri?on
doors. I tell you It's pretty hard for
an innocent man to have to be held a
Srisoner In such a place as this You
aye no idea what It is.
Will cl^se as I am so sick I cannot
write any more. I suffer very much
here and I have to write lying down
on '.he stone floor, and there is hardly
any light In this room. Thanking you
again for what you have done and may
do in ray interest, I remain your
friend; h. C. FAULKNER.

overdose of morphine, which later caused
his death. Whether the drug was taken

EASEMENT NOT WEAKENED.
Erroneous Report of Danger Along
the Sacramento.
WOODLAND. July 2s.â The following i
1 paragraph is g^oing- the rounds of the j
press:
"Immediate work on the easement !
above Sacramento is said to be necessary,
owing to the fact that the high water of
the past winter weakened it in places.
It is feared that if these repairs are not
i made the entire structure may go out next ,
i winter."
This is incorrect. The easement has !
not weakened in places, and there is not
the slightest danger that it will go out ;
next winter, or. for that matter, in the
! next ten years. What is needed Is some
, brush and riprap to protect the land ad- ,

BERESFORD'S HORSES.
Former Speaker Reed Gives an Inter
esting Account of His Travels
and Observations on the
Continent.
Copyright* 18S3. by the A*EC*latPd PrÂ»ss.
LONDON. July 29.â The inrush of
Americans is unabated and they are to
be seen everywhere. They are lavish pur
chasers of â  -.thing that strikes their
fancy. Shopkeepers -ay this is the best
Amerl season since the financial panic
of 1596. and they declare that the new
customs reflations seem -not to affect ;
purchasers, and the sign conspicuous in
many shop windows. "Prices made to suit
the American tariff." Is apparently su
jif-rfluous. This is particularly tru as
regards art and curio dealers, who suy '
that Americans no longei ask the price
of an article but purcha** the. most ex
pensive objects they display.
The return of "Plunger" Riley Grannan
to London is believed to foreshadow a
vigorous turf campaign by the Ameucan
contingi and the fact that no one nas
been able to ride Lord William Beres
ford's horses to victory since the suspen- I
sion of Tod Sloan has done much to re
new faith in him and to create the belief i
that he will repeat his brilliant successes |
when be return?.
It is quite pathetic to see how BurKe,
the Harvard runner, who participated In |
the â  national university athletic
games, takes defeat. He lias been in â¢>â¢ a
most of the weeic with cramps and acute
pains in the stomach. His illness is ag- j
1-ravaK-d by the belief that he alone is
responsible for the i ricans defeat.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press saw him to-day looking haggard
taid ill. Burke has lost fourteen pounds
within the week, but he taiked in a
manly plucky all through my training,"
"I bad pains all through my training,
he said, "and entered the race In a funky j
condition. When I covered three hundred
yards I knew I was beaten. Graham had
a lot in him and finished strong as a bull.
Yes Wendell knew Of my condition, but
we were not throwing away any chances
a -id so I determined to do my best and
was well beaten by the beat man 1 ever j
m t ji. is a stronger man than Jordan, .
whom I defeated in America Now 1 .say
pood-by to the running path. 1 nave
given away my pumps and breeches and
v ill never sel foot upon the track again.
The Saturday Review devotes a leading
,'irticle to Bevere criticism of the American
athletes "who possess virtues we often
associate with professional training, and
comes to the conclusion fliat Americans
are the tter gymnasts and Englishmen
the better athletes. The Spectator, con
gratulating Itself tl-r-t all the long rac<
were won by Englishmen, says the Amer
ican t^am contained at least Irish or
Irish-Americans. "
Thomas B. Reed, former Speaker of the
House of Representatives, greatly en
joyed his run on the Continent. Mr. Reed |
said to the correspondent of th,e Associ
ated Press to-day:

HAD PLANNED TO WRECK
NEW YORK BUILDING!
Infernal Machines and Diagrams

Trunk.
NEW YORK. July 2ft.â Mrs. Jackson,
who conducts a boarding-house nt 305
West Onf' Hundredth and Forty-seventh
street, has furnished the police with evi
dence of what they regard as a conspir
acy to wreck with bombs many of the

"Count" Eugene Noroff. committed bu!

of whom is declared by Mrs. Jackson to
have ended his life soon after the death
of Noroff.
Evidence of the conspiracy, which Mrs.
Jackson turned over to ihe police, wu
found In N'oroff's trunk, which had been
!â¢â !'â¢ in her possession and which she

SMUGGLING GUINN
OUT OF THE STATE
Officer Fleeing With the Bigamist,
Despite Habeas Corpus Pro
ceedings.
STOCKTON, Juiy 29.â Inspector of
Police William H. Medley of Fall River,
Mass., passed through Stockton this
afternoon with Walter R. Gulnn of
Santa Barbara, who is wanted in Mass-
husett? for polygamy. Gulnn has
been under arrest at Los Angeles and
habeas corpus proceedings were tried
to get him away from the Eastern offi
cer. Last night at midnight Medley
put his man aboard the train at Bur
,bank and came through. He did not
expect the Los Angeles officers would
learn of the coup until some time this
afternoon.
Mrs. Gulnn, who is a young heiress,
her parents being the Lakes of Fall
River,- Mass., did not accompany her
husband East, but has gone to Santa

THE BAH FRANCISCO CALL, St'NDAT, JULY 30, 1899.
RIDICULE THE
PEACE CONFERENCE
Opinions of the German
Press.
NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED
EVEN ITS FRIENDS ACKNOWL
EDGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
England and America Severely Criti
cized for Their Fight for the
Dumdum Bullet and Call
ed Inhuman.
CopyriÃhted, 1599. by the Associated Press.
BERLIN". July 29.â The papers this week
have been giving their verdict of the out
come of the Peace Conference at The
Hague. The tone of the comment of the
papers friendly to the conference gener
ally is one of disappointment that so little
has been accomplished, while those op
posing indulge in pleeful felicitations that
no more was accomplished. The Tagblatt
considers that the form of arbitration
adopted marks an important step toward
securing the peace of the world, and adds:
"Whoever Knows the toilsome way In
which progress of international law Is
made will be satisfied with this result."
The Post says: "The result shows that
thus" who had been neither too optimistic
nor too pessimistic in expectations were
in the right."
The most important result the Post sees
Is that n method Is now open to nations
for settling difficulties, saying: "While the
conference has not ushered In the millen
ium. still it shows that the powers are
earnestly striving to preserve for the
peoplt-s the blessings of peace."
The National â¢ Literal Boersen Zeitung
calls th<- final protocol a funeral oration
and Fays the results equal zero.
The jÂ£reuÂ» Zeitung, referring to the
T'nited States and England, says: "Th"
nations that boasted loudest of their hu
manity made the stoutest resistance to
really practical humanitarian proposi
tions."
The Kreuz Zeitung- further points out
that while England and the United States
stood together in opposing the prohibition
of bombs tilled with noxious gases the
United Slates backed up England's r. -
fusal to abandon the dumdum bullet.
"The platonic declaration of the confer
ence for the principles of the Czar's proc
lamation." the Kreuz Zeitung continues,
"introduces absolutely no change in exist
ing conditions."
The Agrarian Deutsche Tages Zeitung
makes merry over the friends of peace,
whose cherished hopes are far from neing
realized.
The Hague correspondent of the Frank
furter Zeitung sayÂ«: "The American dele
gates are quite satisfied with the achieve
ments of the conference. They played a
very happy role, which they were able to
do through their conciliatory position. It
was chiefly due to this position of the
Americans" that Germany was finally won
over to the plan of the permanent arbi
tration bureau. Mr. Holls and others told
the correspondent that after Professor
Zorn's speech, in which Germany's oppo
sition to the permanency of the arbitra
tion court was emphasized, the situation
had grown critical and it seemed probable
that the conference would dissolve pre
maturely and nothing be accomplished,
which would have brought the odium of
the fiasco upon Germany and have the
effect of Isolating her in her relations
with other powers."
COLONEL BURNS
WAITS IN VAIN
Gage Has Not Yet Gone
to Catalina.
GOVERNOR GROWS MUTINOUS
SAID TO BE TRYING TO THINK
FOR HIMSELF.
Politicians Fear That He May At
tempt to Throw Off the Yoke
of the Man From
Mexico.
Speetai Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 29.â Contrary to
all expectations. Governor Hpnry T.
Gage so far has not found time to visit
Colonel D. M. Burns at Catalina,
whither the political loader wended his
way three weeks ago. Governor Gage
will not say when he will leave for Sac
ramento or when he will go to Cata
lina. This peculiar uttitude of the ex
ecutive is causing a deal of trouble
among political bosses in this end of
the State and has given rise to much
gossip. Local Republican leaders are
wondering whether a coolness may not
have arisen between the Governor and
Colonel Burns, that may culminate in
a shattering <>f political alliances BO
closely formed a year ago.
The appointment of Judge Fitzgerald
to the Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judgeship is taken by many to
mean that Governor Gjipp is now act
ing independently, and that he has
taken the political bit between his teeth
with a determination to assume his pre
rogatives. This sentiment is not dis
guised; it is freely spoken and is
heightened by the slap that lawyers
say was given to the dozen of local can
didates for the Superior Court.
On the other hand, the friend? of Cnl
onel Burns assert that he has informed
them Governor Gage did not make the
selection of Judge Fitzgerald until he
was consulted, and that he approved
the course of the Governor. These same
friends go further and assert with *.
charming degree of positlveness that
Colonel Burns is taken into confidence
before any appointments whatever arft
made. That the friends of Burns are
chagrined owing to the failure of thÂ»
< lovernor to meet the man from the
north is apparent.
Work for Thousands of Men.
STOCKTON, July 2ft. â It is now given
out definitely that the first Sierra Road
train will arrive at Angels on January 1
next. The survey on the Tuolumne side of
the river has been completed, and a good
part of It has been done on the other side.
Grading from Jamestown to Tuttletown
will be commenced next Wednesday, and
from Tuttletown will be continued on to
Robinsons Ferry, and from there to An
gels Camp. The depot site has been laid
east of the Utica chlorine works on An
gelÃ Creek. It is the intention of the con
tractors having the construction of the
new road in hand to employ 500(1 men to
work on the road if that number can be
secured.
NEBRASKA'S
VOLUNTEERS
HOME AGAIN
Hancock Arrived Late
Last Night.
â Â« â
ELEVEN HUNDRED ABOARD
WANT TO BE MUSTERED OUT IN
SAN FRANCISCO.
Left Nearly a Hundred of the Regi
ment Dead on the Battlefield or
in the Philippine
Hospitals.
Thf transport Hancock with the gallant
Nebraska volunteers aboard sailed into
the harbor at .11 o'clock last night and
anchored in the stream off Black Point.
The regiment will probably come ashore
this morning. Immediately it was an
nounced thai the Hancock was In sight
Governor Poynter. Cadet Taylor, Adju
tant General Barry and Congressman
Stark, wbo came out from Nebraska for
the purpose of greeting the State troops
as sunn as they should again set foot on
their native soil, left the Palace Hotel and
took a boat at the water front to meet
the big transport in the stream.
The Hancock has a passenger list of
1100, made up of the Nebraska regiment
and discharged and time-expired soldiers.
The men were all delighted with their
trip up from the Philippines and were
glad to be at home again. There were
only fifteen easel of sickness on board,
but none of these were serious.
The Nebraska organization returns by |
nc means a full regiment. There were !
sixty-nine Â©f the men killed in battle and ]
ninny others left in the hospitals because !
of hard work at the front. The regiment j
was kept on the fighting line almost con- |
stuntly from the time the nm gun was I
fired. Colonel Stotaenburg, its popular
commander, lost his life in one ot the
hardest battles of the Philippine cam
paign.
Like the Oregon boys, the men of Ne- I
braska are one and all in favor of h> ing
mustered out in San Francisco, and as It
is the policy of the administration to i on- ;
pult the wishes of the soldiers on that
point it |s likely that orders to that effect
will be issued.
TO COMMAND THE IOWA.
Captain C. F. Goodrich Ordered to
Relieve Captain Terry.
WASHINGTON. July 2!>.â Captain C. F.
Goodrich ha? been detached from com
mand of the cruiser Newark and ordered
to assume command of the battleship
lowa on September 1. relieving Captain
Terry, who is ordered home on waiting or
ders.
The assignment is of special interest in
connection with the plans to make the
lowa the nucleus of a considerable fleet
on the Pacific Coast and execute an ex
tensive programme of naval mnneuvers.
Being the only battleship of the fleet, the
lowa will probably rank first among the
I ships of that station, and Captain Good
irich doubtless will have command.

BOYCOTT ON
CLEVELAND CARS
Merchants Afraid to Pat
ronize the Lines.
ALL UNION MEN JOIN IN
VEHICLES OF ALL KINDS ARE
PRESSED INTO SERVICE.
General Axline Sets a Trap to Catch
Men Who Refuse to Serve the
Soldiers â Law Against
Rioters.
Sr-'rial niaratoh to The Call.
CLEVELAND, July 29.â Although or
der has practically been restored with
in the city, the railroad strike has re
solved itself into a general boycott of
Ihe Big Consolidated Company and
everybody who rides upon Its cars. Ap
parently the strikers have the sympa
thy and active co-operation of all the
labor organizations in the city. Not
only are merchants being punished for
riding on the tabooed cars, bat they are
warned against selling goods to other
people who do ride, on threat of losing
the trade of union men. Instances are
given in which druggists have refused
to sell medicine to people who were
accused of patronizing the Big Consoli
dated Company, and physicians have
been boycotted for riding upon the cars
while going to see their patients. The
boycott is most severe on the small
dealers who do business on streets that
are populated largely by union men and
their sympathizers.
A number of these merchants have
published advertisements to-day, offer
ing rewards ranging from $JS to $500
for reliable evidence thai they or ar.y
of their clerks or relatives have ridden
on the cars since the strike began, and
a number of communications have been
sent to the papers by physicians, gro
cers, butchers and others protesting
(heir innocence of the charge of having
patronized the railroad company. As
yet the big retail merchants have not
felt the effects of the boycott severely,
though it is said some of them have
been requested to forbid their clerks to
ride on the cars.
Thousands of working people are go
ing to and from their homes in buses
Of every kind and description from
huckster wagons to tallyhos, and in
certain sections of the city the cars
run with few passengers. This is not
true of Euclid. Cedar, Central and
Wade Park avenue lines, which run
through the best parts Of the East End.
There the cars are pretty well filled.
The boycott of the troops has arous
ed the ire of Adjutant General Axline.
who says there is a State law to pun
ish persons who interfere with the mil
itia. There Is one section of the stat
utes which provides a maximum pen
alty of $1000 fine and six months' im
prisonment for every person who tries
to Dersuade or discourage a man of the
National Guard from responding to a
call for riot duty. General Axline says
the boycott and the threat of certain
employes t<> put on the blacklist those
employes who turned out with the mil
itia, are covered by this law and he
threatens to Institute proceedings
against dealers if the boycott is contin
ued. He says also that he may begin
under the civil rights law and ho sent
several soldiers to a restaurant for din
ner with the express purpose of bring
ing such action against the proprietor
if he refused to serve them.
The police have begun to deal with
the rioters more severely. Heretofore
they have been arrested for misde
meanor. Hereafter they will be charg
ed with felÂ«>ny. One prisoner was
bound over to-day to the Grand Jury
on the charge of stone-throwing and
the maximum penalty for that offense
is three years' imprisonment in the
penitentiary. Two other prisoners were
arraigned on the charpe. of placing ob
structions on a street railroad track.
The maximum penalty fur that offense
is eight years in the penitentiary. This
action was taken by the police on the
order of Mayor Farley, who insists that
the rioters have been dealt with too
leniently in the police COUftS.

EXAMINER PERSONALITIES.
Tlj E Examiner early began howling for the flag
to be "nailed to the Philippine-." The means
by which bunting was to be nailed to 1200
5 seven thousand miles away was not discussed
ai that tim
Spain had a job oi nailing on hand there that lasted
c than a century and was not finished when she
it up in 1898. The United States has since then
trying to do the same thing, and the Examiner,
ng the discussion of .the general policy of
an enterprise, the value of it to American tax
ers it finished, and its effect upon our domestic
institutions, has thrown itself into a snarling discus
sion of personalities involved in the job. From the
ning of the Spanish war until now that paper,
with its characteristic talent for such discussion, has
pursued personally everybody trusted with responsi
t'rotn the President to the generals in the field.
Its motive, of course, is to advertise itself. No spirit
itriotism, no devotion to the principles of the
I . eminent, enters into it. Last year it entered upon a
scheme to use the dead of the Maine as sandwich men
for advertising purposes, and appointed agents and
collectors all over the United States to beg money
to build a monument to the dead who lost their lives,
in that sini-t'er catastrophe. It succeeded in bunkoing
such nun as Levi P. .Morton and William C. Whitney
to act ;>> vice presidents of its scheme. When Hearst
had succeeded so far he tried to get the use of ex-
President Cleveland's name and prestige, but Mr.
Cleveland responded, coldly, that he declined to permit
his sorrow for the men lost on the Maine to be
diverted into an advertising scheme for Mr. Hearst
and his papers. That killed the matter at once. It
brought other public' men to their senses and people
refused to subscribe to the fund which was designed
t" give notoriety to two yellow papers and their
owner.
Then followed the attack on General Shafter, a sol
dier whose courage had been proved in battle from
his youth up. He planned the Santiago campaiga
and it was carried speedily to an honorable and suc
cc"ful end. But he would not permit Mr. Hearst to
use the victory to advertise himself and since then
has been honored by the blackguard abuse of that
person's newspapers.
Just now General Otis is the subject of personal
attack, lie had a soldier's task assigned to him in
Luzon. He has toiled at it against natural obstacles
that were dimly foreseen, if at all, and has obeyed the
orders of his superiors, which is a soldier's first duty.
A man under arms cannot discuss the political policy
of his country which makes his presence and action in
the held necessary He must, in the best way that pre
sents itself, do his duty.
Whatever criticism may be due in the Philippines,
none is known to justly lie against Otis for his use of
tactics and his effort to carry out instructions and
1 ],'â ;. orders.
Until it iÂ» shown that his initiative has been- used in
opposition to his superiors and to their orders, his
mi and his conduct are unimpeachable.
The policy that put him there and set his task for
him is indorsed by the Examiner. If it have proved
impossible to do more than In- has done to carry out
that policy, the fault is not his. but lies at the door of
papers like the New Yoric Journal and the Examiner,
which have done their best to make such policy appear
proper and its execution feasible.
[mperialists like Hearst cannot turn attention from
their own mistakes, by making a scapegoat of Otis.
Whatever fault there is is at home, not in the Philip
pines, not with the officers and soldiers in a hard
field, executing orders with a valor and dash which
have added to the glory of American arms.
Policeman Barry, who has ambition ;o become a
sergeant, arrested and charged with burglary the other
day a i.vyear-old-boy caught peering through a win
dow pane in the house of Market-street Railway Man
ager Yining. Barry made a fatal mistake. Under the
law, stealing. a look is not more than petty larceny.
AMERICAN CIVILIZATION.
ON Sunday last there was a celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of the organization, under
the auspices of the Episcopal church of Trin
ity parish of San Francisco. C. V. S. Gibbs, still in
active business but the only survivor of the original
I communicants, delivered a most interesting address,
in which he traced the detailed history of the parish and
I astonished the younger members of the congregation
by the record of eminent men and women who had been
connected with j*> work, both in its spiritual and in its
secular departments. Mr. Gibbs himself had been the
president of the Society of California Pioneers, had
extricated St. Luke's Hospital from a condition of
virtual insolvency and raised it to its existing pros
perous condition and, during a life of long duration
and of intense activity, in which he had touched almost
every public interest except political management, had
established a reputation in which there was no flaw,
and that resembled a brilliant trail of light.
Yesterday the Congregatioualists began the cele
bration of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment
of that form of religion in San Francisco and again
the chief spokesman was the only survivor of the first
local communicantsâ David N. Hawley, a gentleman
of whom it may be justly said that, in all the relations
of life, he has maintained the high standard of the
Episcopal representative. He, too, was enabled to
group together in his account of the labor that had
been performed by the Congregational denomination,
in this city and on this coast, the names of men and
women who are known far beyond the limits of the
State of California.
These two incidents have been mentioned purely for
an illustrative purpose. During the next few months
similar celebrations will rapidly accumulate. For sev
enty-rive years or more prior to the adoption of our
State constitution the Catholic church had main
tamed effective missions, the history of which is as
familiar as household words. Even before the
close of the last century the religious element had
permeated the Indian population of the Spanish prov
ince that has now, under American auspices, attained
high distinction among the States of this Union. The
extraordinary intelligence, education and enterprise of
the pioneers of 1849 have been repeatedly eulogized.
But these semi-centennial illustrations enter into the
history of the world as the most convincing proof of
the loftiness of American civilization, wrought into
! symmetry and beauty by the great constitutional re
public.
The thirteen Colonies, which in the first instance
formed the Union, largely owed their origin to relig
ious persecutions. But no such motive power drove
the California pioneers to the shores of the Pacific.
They came here simply in the search for wealth as.
centuries before, the Spanish had gone to Mexico and
Ito Peru. Hardly had they reached our soil, however,
when the genius for organization, the deepest and the
strongest element in our composite race, especially
under the American system, controlled the situation
with unparalleled vigor and success. Not only were
churches of every sort planted, but before January
1, 1850, almost every fraternal or charitable society
then existing in the United States was firmly estab
lished in our midst. Trade and commerce were in
stantly marked by system and by order. Society was
framed into consistency and strength. A complete
form of government for the State and for counties an<l
lor municipalities, which in the debates of 1850 re
ceived the encomiums of the first statesmen in the
country, of such men as Clay and Webster, sprang
into being almost at a stroke, and the men who com
â  posed our first Constitutional Convention, taken from
the professional and from the ordinary walks of life,
constituted a body scarcely equaled in the records of
America. Even lynchings were not the wild outbreaks
of the present day. They were temporary expedients,
analogized to the usual course of justice in legal tri
bunals.
It has been the fashion to refer to the early Cali
fornians as mere adventurers, hunting for gold, wild,
undisciplined and turbulent. They have been miscon
ceived by great writers and in the pages of leading re
views. In fact, they were the very reverse of this
false characterization. They exceeded all precedents
in every part of the globe in the speedy formation of
a progressive commonwealth. Within two or three
years after the migration of 1849 San Francisco, pro
vincial, it is true, was nevertheless possessed of all
the elements of American civilization, and from this
center the force of organization extended to the ex
treme limits of the State. Our school system covered
every county and every municipality, and in no newly
admitted State has it ever been equaled. This fact
will be admitted by every trained educator who has
studied the subject.
Necessarily for many years there were othtr and less
respectable features in our communities. But down
to the present date we have produced no degradation
such as exists in whole quarters of Paris, London,
New York and other metropolitan cities. Now and
for all time our early history will shine resplendently
in the annals of human achievement and in the per
manent literature of the future, in the glowing stories
of the beginnings of States, California will be relieved
from unjust odium and will stand among the leaders
of American civilization.
THE TURN BEZIRK-
SAN FRANCISCO has a joyous and jubilant
welcome for the turners and the friends who
have come to gladden as well as to honor the
city by making it the scene of their biennial festival.
No race of people better understand the art of life
than the Germans, and no class of Germans have de
veloped more fully or more sanely the joyous side of
that art than the turners, so that a turner festival never
fails to show a scene of as wholesome and hearty en
joyment as earth affords.
No feature of German life is more distinctively
characteristic of the race than the various turn vereins
to be found wherever Germans exist in any numbers.
The athletic young German does not tend like the
Anglo-Saxon to football games or to similar sports.
He seeks the gymnasium and there develops every
muscle of the body to an equal degree, so that in
general agility, strength and suppleness he is perhaps
superior to the young men who carry off the honors
of the ball grounds.
As to which of the two methods of training the
i body is the better, authorities differ. Fortunately we
in the United States have both methods, for while our
tendencies are toward the sports for which the British
races are noted, we have among us a German element
sufficiently strong to infuse the spirit of German ath
leticism throughout the country. The young Ameri
can of the future will be able not only to hold inter
national college matches with his British cousins, but
to contend victoriously in the turner contests of his
cousins of Germany.
Whatever may be the differences of opinion con
cerning the relative merits of the two methods of
physical training, there is none at all on the subject of
music. The bawling of any American or British
football team is not like the singing that is heard in
the festivals of the turners. We shall have that music
of friendship and joy with us through all the days of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, JULY 30, 1899.
the festival, and all genial hearts will be responsive to
it. It is going to be indeed a halcyon and vociferous
time and one that will be remembered for many a day.
For the turners and for their friends, therefore, we
have a welcome of more than ordinary cordiality.
There are men of all races in San Francisco, but all
are alike in the humanity that delights in meeting
generous hearts 2nd sharing with them the joys of a
festival big enough to take in a whole city. So long
as the bezirk continues and the turners are with us
San Francisco is theirs. If they do not see what they
want, they will please ask for it.
A POPULAR SUBSCRIPTION.
BY the committee in charge of the work of pre
paring a suitable reception for the California
volunteers on their return from Manila an ap-
peal is made to the citizens for funds to defray the
expense of the grand ceremony, display and other
I festal features of the welcome. It goes without saying
I such an appeal will be met by prompt contributions.
He will be a niggard Californian, indeed, who will not
be glad to contribute something to the fund intended
i for such a purpose.
The subscription in fact will be popular in every
| sense of the word. Popular because it will appeal to
all the people and popular because all the people will
receive it with favor. When all contribute to a fund
I of this kind no one need give much, but it is im
| portant that all should give promptly. The troops
are on their way home. There is none too much time
| left for arranging the jubilant welcome that is in-
I tended for them. It is desirable, therefore, that the
! committee be supplied at once with the money needed
to make the welcome worthy of the city, of the volun
j teers and of the occasion.
With the excitement of the war upon us we made a
I civic holiday to bid our volunteers farewell, and it was
amid the applause of thousands of proud and patriotic
: voices they sailed away to the Philippines. They now
return to us with victory, to find us rejoicing in the
peace which their valor assisted in extorting 30
; promptly from a beaten foe. It is but right they
should receive on their return a welcome which will
attest the pride of their fellow-citizens in their service
snd the general joy over their home coming. To pro
vide that welcome money will be needed. It should be
contributed gladly, liberally and promptly.
GOLD IN CIRCULATION.
1 IZ^LLIS H. ROBERTS of the United States
Treasury in the course of a recent address be
'â* fore the Maryland Bankers* Association
strongly urged them to assist the Government in put
ting gold coin into general circulation in the East,
and pointed out that since the volume of paper is re
stricted it is only by an enlarged use of gold coin the
currency can be increased to meet the demands of
commerce. â¢
After stating that since July I. 1898, the gold in cir
culation had increased by but $62,100,579, while the
net amount in the treasury increased from $189,444,714
to about $246,000,000. Mr. Roberts said:
"Such an increase in the yellow metal available for
currency, with the demand real or alleged for addi
tional circulation, gives vital form to the question,
'Why not add to the use of gold coin? Under exist
iing laws the volume of United States notes is defin
: itely restricted, while silver certificates cannot ex
ceed the standard silver dollars in the treasury, nor
the treasury notes run beyond the bullion held against
them. The national banks while adding to their cir
culation $13,451,994 from July I, 1898, to June, 1899,
; are now quite steadily drawing in their notes, mak
ing a reduction against bonds last month of $1,041,860
and thus far this month of $216,500. Practically, then,
without new legislation, the only way to increase the
currency is by the use of gold coin."
Obviously, as Mr. Roberts said, the question for
Eastern bankers about gold coin is not â can they
get but will they use it? The issue is a strange one to
people of the Pacific Coast, where gold is in such cir
culation that paper money is a rarity hardly ever seen
in the course of retail trade. In the East, however,
the people have grown accustomed to paper and the
banks appear to be unwilling to educate them to the
use of gold. Even among the more influential news
papers of that section there is an opposition to the
use of the yellow coin.
The New York Times, for example, in commenting
upon the subject recently, said:
"Gold coins doubtless have all the merits which were
ascribed to them by Mr. Ellis H. Roberts, but they also
have the inconveniences which he admitted they pos
sessed, and the chances are that his arguments for the
more extended use in ordinary business transactions
of value's best representative will be as little heeded
as controverted. The citizens have had many painful
and expensive proofs that paper currency is open tc
serious objection of more sorts than one, but then it
is so handy and coins are such a nuisance!''
Against such prejudice as that it is almost impos
sible to argue effectively. A people who prefer soiled
i paper for money and regard gold coin as a nuisance
are well nigh beyond the reach of reason. We have
therefore, in the East the strange spectacle of a com
munity complaining of a lack of money in general cir
culation and yet refusing gold, which the Government
lis literally begging them to take off its hands and
put to use.
Another San Franciscan has distinguished himself
abroad. Harry Bostwick, son of Rev. Henry E. Bost
vvick of Trinity Presbyterian Church in this city, was
manager of the Seoul Electric Company during the
riots which followed the killing of a child by one of
the cars. A Korean mob was soon clamoring for his
blood. With a single American companion he faced
and dispersed it. All he did was to raise his hand
I and exclaim "Chorikah!" which in English means
"Git." His air was so determined and his pronun
ciation of Korean so bad that the heathens "got" in
a hurry.
. â¢
Time and again since he has been a champion pugi
list, Jim Jeffries, handy as he is conceded to be with
i his mitts, has been caught by observant reporters
â¢ trying to slip money to some poor man or woman.
i No one ever caught him at it before he went under
1 Brady's management and still they say he has im
proved in the use of his hands.
Before the Czar's Peace Congress adjourns and
while it is still on the subject of conventions, would
it not be wise for the delegates, in the interest of uni
versal peace, to recommend the prohibition of Demo
! cratic conventions in the United States?
A dispatch from Seattle announces the destruction
i by fire of the Goliah, which, it is claimed, was the
oldest steam vessel on the coast. Must be a mistake
somewhere â what's the matter with the Growler?
The spirit of American activity is contagious. Even
the volcanoes in the newly Americanized territory of
Hawaii seem imbued with it.
BIGGEST RACE OF MEN IN THE WORLD
They Live in the Antarctic Regions and Have Just Been Discovered
by Explorer Cook.
From a Photograph.
Dr. Frederick A. Cook, who has just returned from an exploring expedition to the South Polar regions, brings pho
tographs of a race of cannibal giants discovered by him near the Antarctic Circle. The existence of such a race has always
been denied by scientists, but Dr. Cook has not only seen and talked with them, but brings back photographs to prove
beyond argument That the biggest race of human beings in the world is to be found in the frozen south. The monstrous
forms of both the men and women are clad in furs; the men arm themselves with bows and arrows and wooden clubs.
Their strength und endurance are remarkable. The men can outrun any horse on a long stretch. They can cover fifty
miles in a few hours.

SUGGESTIONS TO
PREVENT FOREST FIRES
To the Editor of The Call: Noticing an
editorial of yours regarding "Forest Fires
and the Necessity of Their Prevention,"
I take the liberty of a suggestion.
Year after year in this and other parts
of Santa Barbara County fires occur In
the surrounding hills and mountains. The
country now is becoming gradually de
nuded of many of its trees and forest
patches. This year, however, no fires have
occurred, and it is attributable to the vig
ilance of the Ignited States Forest
Rangers, who are now employed at a fair
salary during the summer and fall months
to patrol the Government forestry re
serves, and with it they patrol all the
adjacent lands around about. They watch
each individual that comes within their
allotted territory and prohibit any camp
fires In the mountains where there is the
least apprehension of danger, every man
being Interviewed and watched. They also
have facilities for extinguishing an incip
ient fire.
Now If the State could have such a
patrol over its mountain lands it would
be of incalculable benefit and would solve
this matter of fires in the mountains and
the destruction of forests and denudation
of the country's water sources. Very re
spectfully, L. E. BLOCHMAN.

c SONG FROM THE FRONT.
The following verses published in a re
cent number of Freedom, Manila, serve
as an interesting illustration of the songs
our soldiers are composing and singing
when off the firing line:
VOLUNTEER REGULARS' LAMENT.
Respectfully Dedicated to Uncle Sam and
President MeKinley.
We are getting tired of soldiering In
These sultry Philippines
Ami rather sick of hard tack, boiled
Rice and. pork and beans.
But we've stood It with true Yankee grit.
As Is the only proper way.
And we never thought of kicking
Till they swiped our travel pay.
You sent us here on transports
That went tumbling like a log.
And the grub on which you fed us, sir
Would almost kill a hog;
But we lived on hope and sea breeze.
Not a word had we to say;
But we've got a kick a-coming
Since you swiped our travel pay.
We left our farms and ranches
And our business in the towns,
We crossed the trackless ocean
And whipped the Spanish dons;
Forced the gate? of old Manila.
Where the Spaniards long held sway.
And now must lose that pittance,
A private's travel pay.
We have slept in muddy trenches
Charged the bamboo, thick and thin.
Crossed rice fields, bogs and marshes,
Tramped through mud that reached
chin;
Now our sky is dark and clouded.
Of hope there's not a ray;
'Tis a case of total eclipse
Since you swiped our travel pay.
We have trounced the Filipinos;
Yes, have fought them day and nightâ
Never questioned for a moment
If the cause was wrong or right.
Many a brave, true-hearted comrade
That has fallen by the way
Is a greater loss to some one
Than our paltry travel pay.
Well, some time we may get a chanca
To even up the debt.
For some of us are living now.
And will live still longer yet;
But some cold November morning
Some candidates will say.
'"Oh, that they'd never meddled with
A soldier's travel pay."

AFTER PEACE, WHAT?
The Congress of the United States,
which can alone fix the terms on which j
the Philippines are to be held or released,
will meet in December, If not earlier, and
will then take up the subject, the most
momentous that it has hail to deal with
since the Civil War, perhaps the most
momentous that ever came before it. We
shall then be at the turning of the ways,
and must decide whether ours shall be a
republic dedicated to the principle of i
self-government or a conquering nation ;
grabbing everything within reach and
holding subject peoples without any in
tention of either introducing self-govern
ment among them or of allowing them to
I
achieve it for themselves. The nearin<
of the time when this Issue must be
fought out among ourselves has prompted
Senator Davis of Minnesota to take an
early stand in favor of perpetual reten
tion of the Philippines. The chairman of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela

held as a subject race permanently and
not provisionally. There is a certain

Secretary Wilson on |
the New Industry.
REQUIRES MANY FACTORIES
A QUARTER OF THE NUMBER
NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
The Head of the Department of Agri- :
culture Discusses a Matter That
Interests the People of
This State.
Secretary of Agriculture Wilson was the'
recipient of many attentions yesterday. \
The State Board of Trade, represented by j
President Chipmah, E. W.'. Runyon and '
W. 11. Mills, took the Secretary, together
with Governor Tanner of Illinois and Gov- j
ernor Poynter of Nebraska,- on â  a drive
which carried the distinguished party
through the park and landed theni at the
Cliff House for lunch. Besides those men
tioned above, there were present. at the ]
lunch Adjutant General Barry of Ne- |
braska, Chief Justice Beatty, Mayor Phe- ;
lan, Major General Shafter, Adjutant
General Semans, Attorney General Ford, I
M. H. de Young, Professor Wtckson. Cap- i
tain Nelson, Dr. Winslow, Colonel Pippy. '
Judge Cotton and J. R. Dunn. In the
afternoon the party- visited the rooms of
the State Board of Trade and inspected
the mineral collection of the State. The j
evening was passed by the Secretary rest
ing from the fatigues of the day and re
ceiving in his rooms the numerous, callers
who came to pay their respects and wel
come him to the city. ;
Secretary Wilson is a great advocate of
the beet sugar industry. Speaking on the
subject last night, he said:
"Last fall we had nineteen factories. in
the entire United States for the manu- |
facture of beet sugar. TEia fall we will j
have fully fifty. They are being built in
the States of New York and New Jersey
f*r the most part, though there are some
going up in other, States as well, One is j
in progress of construction in Minnesota, j
one In each of the Pacific Coast States,'
one has been completed' at Ogden, Utah, ,
and another is now going up at Grwnd â¢
Junction, Colo. â¢ _ ;
"The industry is increasing. TN c bought i
18 000,000 tons last year. That is about the
total amount produced in Germany. The 1
purchases we made were contracted tor in
Germany, France, Belgium and Holland.
To offset the necessity for purchasing |
abroad and to produce all that would be
needed for consumption in this country
would require the operation of about two
i hundred factories which could be built
i at an average cost of about $500,001 apiece. i
! it would require from one million to one (
million and a half acres to grow the
"As rear as can be ascertained by send- i
. mc an agf-nt to the Caribbean S< a Islands
it costs the people it those places 2 rents
per pound to produce their sugar. Where
the pulp from the â ' factory is wasted or
fed lo cheap steera, it costs, the people
: of the United States about aÂ»4 cents per
pound to get their sugar from the., beet, |
the returns dependingTn a great measure
â¢on the disposition that is made of the |
pulp. If the pulp .should be fÂ«d to dairy
cows and firpt-class butter made, and the
: pulp will make flrstrclass butter, then we
can produce butter as cheaply from beets
as they can produce it from cane in these
tropical islands, or from beets in the
countries of Europe! â¢ '
"Experiment along, these linns ha* dem
onstrated the great value of beet pulp
; in butter making. Our sugar beet grow
! ers require some education in this re
â  gard Business should be done on ' tne
basis that the pulp belongs to the roan
who grows the beets. YVhen he takes
a load of beets to the factory he should
take a load of pulp back home. Then
: it can be used as milch cow fodder and
the dairy business of the country will
Boon assume proportions that will aston
â  ish you. As soon as th" beet grower nÂ»
alizes this fact the United States can snap
its figers at the producers of the whole
world. _ . . .
"With regard to the land best snitoa
for the cultivation of the sugar Leot,
there is plenty of it all over the \\ est.
Either Washington, Oregon or this .state
could alone produce enough sugar beets
to supply the demand of the entire coun
try Any one of several Eastern fotates
I cari do the same thing. The sugar pro
duced from the beet is every wh?t as
good as the article that comes out of the
cane. When all foreign substance is re
; moved no mortal man can tell the dif
ference. Sugar is sugar, no matter how
it is produced." t *. w
The cretary also spoke on other sub
jects concerninc his visit out here and
said that he greatly hoprd to see about
j as much of the farming industry of the
State as could be inspected in the lime
ho has at his disposal. Monday he will
leave for Log Angeles, and after a tour
throughout the surrounding country h*
1 will return to San Francisco. From then
j on his plans are as yet Indefinite.

BALDWIN HOTEL
RUINS LOOTED
FOR OLD JUNK
Systematic Theft by
Employes.
ONE OF THE WATCHMEN JAILED
SENSATIONAL FEATURES ARE
EXPECTED.
Judge Treadwell Will iiaise the De
fendant's Bail Owing to Serious
Allegations Made Known
to Him.
Ever since the destruction of the Bald
win Hotel by fire a number of junk deal
ers of this city have been adding to their
wares by the acquisition of stolen ma
terial from the ruins. The arrest of cr.e
of the employes engaged in this business
was made the other day at the instiga
tion of K. J. Baldwin in order to discover
the dishonest parties and bring them to
justice. It is said that since the fire thou
sands, of dollars' worth of material has
been stolen, and that the ruins have been
dismantled of everything which would
realize a 10-cÂ«nt piece in a junkshop.
ThÂ© case of William Harris, a watch
man employed about the ruins, who is
charged with burglary and petty larceny,
came up in Judge Treadwefi's court yes
terday The defendant was arrested on
the morning of July 25 by Officer Kiftane
and charged with petty larceny. He was
detected in the act of stowing away
quantities of copper and brass in sacks,
which were to be hauled. away later to
junkshopn. Kiffane had received instruc
tions to watch the ruins, as the owner
had discovered a bold theft of property.
About 6 o'clock on last Tuesday morning
the officer peeped into the ruins. He saw
Harris in the Act of loading several sacks
with junk. When the thief sighted the
officer he ran away, and his capture oc
cupied the best part of an hour. Tha
charge of petty larceny was raised to a
charge of burglary by Judge Treadwell
on Thursday,- and the hearing was set
for yesterday. Three sacks of copper and
brass appear as evidence against the de
fendant.
E. J. Baldwin was an interesting spec
tator in the courtroom. He says that he
is determine! to prosecute the prisoner.
Jud^e Tr>r\dwell made an order reducing
Harris" bail to $sno and continued the case
until Monday. Later in the day the Judge
was made cognizant of the fact that Har
ris was not alone implicated in the thiev
ing, but that it has been the result of a
preconcerted action between several men
who have been receiving pay as em
ployes about the place. The Judge ascer
tained that thousands of dollars' worth
of zinc. ' brass, conppr and fixtures have
been taken from the nlace and that other
arrests are likely to follow.
Considering the seriousness of the affair
Judge Treadwell reconsidered his deter
mination to rrdura Harris" bail and will
change his order.
AMONG THE CRICKETERS.
Team. From Southern California May
Play Here Next Month.
, The California Cricket Association held
a meeting at the Occidental Hotel Friday
night. The amendment to the rules gov
erning matches, of which due notice had
been given by George Theobald, one of
the delegates of the Pacific Club, and also
to discuss the proposed visit of an eleven
fnÂ«Ti Southern California were consid
ered. Section 3 of article XV of the by
laws of the association was originally in
serted to prevent the bringing of good
cricketers from other parts of the State
to San Francisco for the purpose of
'strengthening city teams contending for
a trophy, as was done In some instances.
The section reads: "Members of any
affiliated club may be memb< of all
affiliated clubs, but can play only with
anil for one club during the same year
except as hereinafter provided.'.' Under
this section H" C. Casidy, lieutenant cap
tain, and T. W. G. Wallace, secretary, of
the Mountain Copper Company Cricket
Club at Keswick, Shasta. County, both of
whom were formerly members of the PaÂ«
cific Club, would not have been permitted
to play for their old city club while on a
'visit to San Francisco. This hardship
would have been incurred 1 because the
club at Keswick is affiliated with the as
sociation, whereas, if it were not *o affili
ated its members would have been under
no such disability. The amendment, which
embodied a just principle, was carried
unanimously.
With regard to the suggestion that the
San Francisco cricketers should defray
half the transportation expenses of the
visiting team from Southern California
the delegates were of the opinion that this
is impossible, as the association has not
sufficent funds for the purpose and the
Individual players could not sustain the
expense, It .was not regarded as prac
ticable to hire an inclosed ground and
charge admission, as the cost of printing,
advertising and rent would be barely
covered by the gate money. If It were
necessary to lay down a concrete pitch
a debt -would be Incurred as a result of
the match. â â¢". ' L v
Entertainment during their stay in San
Francisco will be gladly offered by the
local cricketers, but that is all they can
do. As several Southern Callfornlans who
are goifers as wll as cricketers will prob
ably take part in the Del Monte carnival
of sports, it may be posible to get up a
cricket match for the visitors either be
fore the opening or after the closing day
at Monterey. The match set for August
20 or that scheduled for August 27 might
he postponed to make room for a game
between the visitors and the. local crick
eters. The team of southerners would
probably include C. E. Maud, who is a
golfer, cricketer and polo player: M. G.
Burmester, president of the Santa Mon
ica Golf Club; R. H. Hay-Chapman and
W H Young, who are well-known golf
ers and G. Betts, the polo expert.
A visit of Ban Francisco cricketers to
Keswick is being discussed, and an efTort
will be made to get up a team. The Kes
wick men have twice visited San Fran
cisco to play association football matches,
and are desirous to receive a visit from

BUTCHERS ON STRIKE.
Men Walked Out Because a Union
Man Was Discharged.
KANSAS ("tTY, July 89.â owing to con
tinued trouble with the members of the
local unions of the Amalgamated Associ
ation of Meat Gutters and Butcher Work
ers, the entire killing department of the
Sehnrzchild & Sulzberger Packing Com
pany was closed to-day. Over 800 men
are out oÂ£ work. Unless the leaders of
the Meat cutters' Association will, at the
request of the company, take radical ac
tion to compel the lay members of the
union to abide by the agreements made
last week, none of the 10<Vi men employed
by the plant will be allowed to return to
work Monday.
The present trouble started yesterday
when twenty-five tallowmtn walked out

Sheriff Charles F. Blackington of So

yesterday, having in charge Ernest Gen

he caused to be made at Redding, Cal.,
the other day. I pon his arrival in town
the Sheriff placed his prisoner in the City
Prison, and will make an early start with
hini to the .scene of the crime. The of
fense for which Gentry is wanted is a
grave one. and the prisoner is a danger

responsible for the capture, but he arrest

"Jack" Messer, who was also implicated
in the robbery.
On April 10. ISDP. a bold robbery was
committed in the Alamogordo mill at Al

FRANEY WILL BE
M'CONNELL'S OPPONENT
The Kival Welter-Weights Will Meet
Before the National Club
in August.
After extended negotiations the officials
of the National Athletic Club have found :
an opponent for Frank McConnell in the ;
person of "Jim" Franey. The men will \
box In Wood-ward's Pavilion on August 16 ;
and will weigh in at US pounds.
Franey was the boxer who made so im- j
petuous a fight with Charley Goff and who j
paid the penalty. He is a boxer of the
whirlwind type and should make an excel- j
lent adversary for McConnell. The men
are about the same height and reach and
both have proved themselves game. Mc-
Connell is in condition now. Having been .
given a careful preparation for his bout j
with Neill by Tim McGrath. he will
need only light work to keep on edge.
Franey has been rusticating in the coun
try and will settle down to training at
once.

AN AMENDMENT MISSING.
Supervisors' Clerk Russell Discovers
a Mistake in the Statutes.
John Russell, clerk of the Board cf Su
pervisors, yesterday discovered that a
constitutional amendment adopted by the
Lrf-Eislature at its last session did not j
appear in the statutes. The amendment
provides for the payment of certain debts
to the amount of (210.000 contracted by
the city and county of San Francisco in
1892 and 1893. It was thought at first that
the non-appearance of the amendment in
the statute bunks would prevent its ap
pearance on the ballot at the next gen
eral election, when it must be voted upon
by the people, i>m Secretary of State
Charles F. Curry, who was in this city
yesterday, spvs that if the Legislature
adopted it there is a record of that fact j
in hi? office and the amendment will duly ,
appear on the ballot. !

Perry Belmont's Gonfalon beat tho Dwyer
pair, Trumpet and Shoreham, who were
coupled at 1 to 6 in the betting. Maher
took him to the front at the fall of the

the favorite, Bangle a strong second
choice, and Latson .the outsider. At the
start Don de Oro and Bangle ran head
and head through the t stretch, with L;it- ;
son six lengths behind. - Around the lower,
turn Don de Oro began to draw away,
and as they went into the'backstreteh:
Don de Oro had a length the better of
Bangle, with l^atson rÂ«atlng along ten
lengths behind. Around the upper turn,
with one mile finished, Don de Oro got
another half-length, and was leading by
a. length and a half as they came down
the stretch the second time, while Latson
was twenty lengths behind Bangle. As
they rounded the lower turn the last time
Bangle began to move up slowly, and
when they were straightened out on the
backstretch he and Don de Oro were head
and head. Just as they caxne to the upper
turn Maher sent Bangle to the front, and
as the flag dropped for the end of the
second mile Don de Oro was laboring a
length and a half behind. Jn the stretch
Maher saw he was a winner and pulled

Oakland Team Shut Out.
WATBONVILLE, July 29.â "Dad" Ham
per demonstrated to-day his right to
stand at the head of the baseball pitchers
of the State, notwithstanding the fact
that he has been in harness longer- than
any pitcher on the coast. For nine in
nings the Oakland Dudes attempted to
straighten out his curves and shoots, with
the result that ten of them hit only the
atmosphere. Not one of them was given a
tree pass to first .and not a solitary hit
was made. Only one of the Dudes was
left op. a liasÂ». In the sixth Harper batt< I
the ball to deep center and made the
round of the bases In easy style, but was
called oin (or not touching- the third bag.
The Sugar Beets plugged Steffani hard, :
and their fielding was of the gilt edge
variety. Manager Morris knows how to
get good work out of his men. The score:

Reliance 10, Nile .8.
Freeman's Park, near Golden Gate sta
tion, was the scene of much baseball ec
stasy yesterday afternoon, when the Re
liance and Nile teams batted and ran
through nine innings of excellent dia
mond sport. The crowd was there, and it
asserted itself at all times, especially in
the eighth inning, when the Oaklandersput
in the finishing touches which made vic
tory of defeat. Nile, in emblematic green,
then furled its glowing colors and raised
the black flag, while the maroon and
white floated in the breeze.
A section of society was there to ap
plaud with gloved hands and stamp well
shod feet. Dr. Pardee and John A. Brlt
ton performed heroic service as umpires,
and they are now many pounds lighter in
weight for their grilling work. At one
time Cal Ewing. than whom there is no
greater exponent of baseball in Oakland,
clashed swords with the umpires and en
gaged In a heated mental battle with Dr.
Pardee. The latter, with his dauntless
eye, finally subdued the former, and the
game went on. Ewing forgot to mucilage
his fingers befora the game began, with
the result that of the four chances he had
offered to him four glittering errors
gliMen on the score card opposite his
name. John Mitchell emulated Kwing's
work and did as much for the Nile green.
In the eighth inning the score was 8 to 7
in favor of the Nile club. William Na
thaniel Friend , dnekod in the grotesque
habiliments of an Irish lad, gave a whoop
that set the benches wagging. His small
hat let the burning sun rays scorch his
bead, and "Willie" was an Indian for two
minutes. But the Reliance team benefited
by the outburst. Three runs were made
In rapid sviccession. the last by Pratt on
a stolen base from third to home. Tills
caused Ewing to show his sole leather
again and forced Dr. Pardee to assert his
authority l>> ordering the Nile kicker to
take his place on third, where ho be
longed. The score remained unchanged
after this inning.
The lineup was as follows:
Nile Positions. Reliance.

Hares Lead the Bogs Across the
Field in Many Races â Lottie
M Favorite for the
Stake.
The three stakes at Union Coursing
Park ytsterday provided sensational si>ort
with many surprises. One of these was
the race between J. Dean's great dog
Connnemara and the Curtis dog, Cavalier.
The hare swung around to Cavalier and
he began to run up a formidable score at
once, being apparently an easy winner.
The hare proved an unusually strong one
and finally started across the field for the
escape. Connemara took possession of
the hare and worked it skillfully until it
finally escaped. Connemara's brLi'.ant
work won for him the flag.
J. H. Rosseter's Recording Angel, al
though only nine months old, is picked as
the winner of one of the sapling stakes.
In her two races she led her opponents
five lengths. The other sapling stake is
thought to be between J. J. Edmonds'
Whisky Hill and Lande & Gerbtr'9
Rienzi. For the final of the open stake
Connemara is selling 3Vi to 1; St. Uran,
Bohe and Warship 6 to 1, and Mac's Mel

rounds of the stakes as run yesterday are

The Market-Street Railroad Company j
Will Pave With Bitumen In

Storekeepers and property owners on I
Sixth street wore a happy smile yesterday j
when the good news was conveyed to j
them that the Market-street Railroad i
Company Intended to pave that portion
of the street between the car tracks with ]_
bitumen Instead of basalt blocks. For
this change of pavement the storekeepers i
In particular have been contending: for
fome time but were unable to accomplish
their object as long as the ghost cars kept
bobbing up and down at intervals of ;
hourly trips. Xow that the "corkscrew

ptreet Company yielded to the wishes of
the property owners and tenants and
agreed to niake the first move in having j
the â .Tire Btreet paved with a modern >

There is, however. onÂ« block (that be- \
tween Howard and Folsom streets) that :
will not g-et the bitumen pavement right j
away. A dispute as to the proper grado
compels the railroad company to put down !
a basalt block pavement for the present, i
and until the proper understanding of Its ;
rights may be adjusted. On the block
between Folsom and Harrison streets the ;
railroad track stands three feet above the i

ANOTHER BIG
JUDGMENT FOR
THE CREDITORS
Decision in the School
Case Rendered.
INTERVENORS WIN THE FIGHT
COPY BOOK CASE IS NOW BE
FORE THE COURT.
Demurrer to the Complaint Brought
to Prevent a Chang* of the
Writing System Is
Overruled.
The Mission High School funds, to
gether with other moneys In the treas
ury, will be diverted from their channels
and turned over to the merchant credi
tors of the School Department. This was
decided yesterday by Judge Hebbard in
the action of Fred Mdrdecai against Audi
tor "Wells, Treasurer Truman and the
Board of Education, in which the Union
Trust Company wbb assignee of creditors
whose claims aggregated some $35,000.
Mordecal had furnished the department
with goods to the value of JIR2 80. With
many others his claim was repudiated by
the board on the ground that no funds re
mained from which it could be paid. Suit
was brought to compel the board to audit
the claim and an injunction was asked
prohibiting the board from paying the
various claims against the Mission High
School fund that that fund might be di
verted and used to liquidate his demand.
In this action preferred creditors of the
department, through Instruction of At
torney Frank Powers, assigned their
claims to the Union Trust Company, and
they entered the suit as intervenors.
After hearing the evidence Judge Heb
bard pave Judgment In. favor of the in
tervenors as prayed. It is said that an
appeal will be taken, as there is some dis
satisfaction among those creditors whose
claims were not dignified by being placed
on the preferred list.
â¢'The decision of Judge Hebbard Is of
greater Importance to the teachers than
many of them suppose," said C. H. Mur
phy chairman of the teachers' litigation
committee. "The teachers in mass-meet
ing directed the committee to relinquish
all rights to the $36,000 then supposed to
be available for the payment of outstand
ing claims for the first half of the past
flpcnl year. The merchants drew out all
of this money on their claims as per
agreement of teachers and merchants.
The litigation committee declined to be
entirely governed by the agreement di
recting the surrender of all the moneys
available for that fiscal year for the pay
ment of outstanding claims. We drove
the merchants to a tighter bargain by
agreeing to share any other moneys avail
able proportionally. The amount of the
teachers' unpaid salary aggregates $190,000
and that of the merchants $35,000. Now,
under the decision of Judge Hebbard, the
litigant teachers will receive their pro
portion of the amount turned over to the
Union Trust Company, where, had the
committee not acted up<in its own judg
ment, the merchants would have been
paid in full and the teachers would not
nave received anything. Had the teach
ers agreed to the compromise advised by
their representatives and attorneys, they
would have received about $40.tXK) Instead
of about half of that amount."
The demurrer of the Board of Education
to the complaint of J. S. Green, who seeks
to enjoin the board from changing the
system of penmanship used in the various
schools from the California vertical sys
tem to the round-hand system, was filed.
Issues will now be Joined and the case will
go to trial on its merits.
GOOD-BYE
MR. MORRISON
AS MEPHISTO.
THEATER goers have this week I
crowded the Alcazar to the limit of '
its capacity and even a little beyond,
bidding good-by, as it were, to that i
veteran actor. Mr. Lewis Morrison, who !
has endeared himself to us all by years of
well-directed labor In his chosen field.
Much that is best in dramatic literature
we have se^n presented, because hla re
spect for the standard drama outweiphed
a consideration for gain. He has ever been
ready to lend a hand to promising play
wrights and more than one, now on the
road to fame, owes the opportunity of a
hearing to this actor's kindly intervention.
California he loves, and with reason, for
California has ever been ready to ap
plaud his successes. He has kept her
clever children in mind and the "Faust"
companies he starts on the road next
season will contain many a California
aspirant for histrionic honors, for, with
the Golden State in his summer itinerary,
he left the ranks open, sure of finding
here just the recruits he needed. To-night
Mr. Morrison plays Mephisto for the last
time, for it will no longer be included in
his repertory. He divorces the character
with sorrow, fnr it has given him fame
and fortune and through all the years has
not lessened its power to draw. But the
role of Marguerite, however attractive it |
may be to an audience when played by
Miss Roberts, is a trying and monotonous
one for a yoiing: woman to portray indefi
nitely, with her future in view Mr. Mor
rison has made an elaborate scenic pro
duction of George Foster Platt's "Fred
erick the Great" the feature of next sea
son's tour. Miss Roberts' Marguerite, so
essentially German In atmosphere, and
Mr. Morrison's Mephisto have been too
often i<iaised to hang upon words of ap- i
proval from me. but a word may be said ;
of Mr. Whlttlesey's excellent work as
Faust. Nature has given him the right
fihyslque, art has made htm an ideal stage
over and a costumer wirTi a soul has done
the rest. Mr. Dennithorne plays Valen
tine with intelligence and strength and
rises in the part quite above the manner
isms that so often mar his performances.
The minor support is good and gratefully
well rehearsed.
Bidding quod-by to Mr. Morrison recalls
a rather pathetic story of his boyhood.
Day after day, in the town where he
lived, h.? passed on his way to work a
drugstore that had for him one magnetic
attraction. In a corner of one of the- win
dows stood a Hill glass jur of beautiful
vari-colored gumdrops. and how his
mouth did water and his stomach yearn
for those delicious sweets! How often
did he flatten his nose against the pane
and wish for tho wherewithal to purchase.
Two for a penny they sold, and seldom
could ho get the copper to buy the tantal
izing: two. "When I get rich." he would i
Siiy to himself,- "1 shall buy all the gum- i
drops 1 can eat, and have one big feast, i
But he left the towu and the gumdrops
to seek fortune in a bigger world, and!
the boyish longing was left unsatisfied, i
as maiiy a boyish longing must ever be. j
Years afterward, whe.ii wealth was his.
he went back to Ijls boyhood's home, and j
there. In tho same window, in the same \
corner, stood the same glass jnr, tilled ;
to the brim with what might easily pass :
for the same gumdrops. He bounded into j
the shop, bought the treasure, -jar and all.
and took it home with a -merry heart, only
to find that the boyish longing had died j
unsatisfied and that possession came too
lute for happinessâ the epitome of life, it
sei-med. Tears sprang to his eyes, but he !
wiirk^d them back, went in sparch of a
boy with a gumdrop appetite second only }
to his own departed one, and filled him up
to the very throat.
Next week an elaborate production of
"Romeo and Juliet" is billed, and should
prove a big attraction. Miss Roberts will
no doubt be a charming Juliet, and will
have the advantage of a Romeo worthy of
her affections. For the coming season the
Alcazar management has secured as lead-
Ing man G. F. Ormonde, late of the Ly
ceum Company. New York.

great London Garrlck Theater success,
"Brother Officers," is to be brought out
at the Columbia Theater by Henry Miller
and the special company on Monday even
ing, August 7. The play deals with Eng
lish army life and promises to be a suc
cessful play for this Bide of the water.
"Madame Sans Gene" has tested the
capacity of the California Theater and
given Miss Bates an opportunity for some
very strong acting. On Monday evening
Bronson Howard's "One of Our Girls"
will be presented, with Miss Bates In the
leading- role. The play deals with the
of a young American girl In
gay Paris, and Is clever In dialogue und
action. Mr. Frawley will play Captain

Two San Francisco favorites, Idalene
Cotton and Nick Long, make their ap
pearance at the Orph^um this week. Miss
Cotton, when but seven years old, made
her debut at the Bush-street Theater and
was for three years a member of the Al
cazar stock company. Always a clever
mimic, ilie has made a specialty of the
gift, and in her comedietta, entitled
"Managerial Troubles, " she will introduce
imitations of Eleanore Duse, Anna Held
and Johnstone Bennett. Next week Cot
ton and Lon? will produce the fourth act
of "Zaza." Miss Cotton assuming the role
now being played in New York by Mrs.
Leslie Carter. The bill for the week in
cludes Dave Meier, the bag-punching ar
tist; Herr G. yon Palm, the lightning oil
painter; Joseph Adelman, the xylophone
player, and retains Elizabeth Murray,
Laura Joyce Re]), La Fafalla, the Phoites
and the Eldridges.
"Wang." well sung and appropriately
staged as it is, would easily do another
week's good business at the Tivoll, but
the grand opera season and the much to
be regretted departure of Mr. Stevens
force it off the boards. During- the first
week "Alda" and "Lucia" will be sung on
alternate nights.
Eleven popular vaudeville artists make
an attractive bill for the coming week at
the Chutes. Joe Matthews, a clever
singer of coon song-*, makes her first ap
pearance; an acrobatic trio present a
kr.ock-about comedy; Hallet and Carroll
offer a new sketch, and Blanche Le Claire
Sloan eives an exhibition on the flying
rings. Other interesting: features are
billed. On Thursday, amateur night, the
fat ladies' bicycle race will be repeated.

REPUBLICANS ALL IN LINE
â â¢Â«â
--HARMONIOUS CONSOLIDATION
OF AIX ASSOCIATIONS.
Bold Scheme of Rainey-Examiner
League â Democrats Torn by
Factionnl Strife in the
Banks.
Th<? clubs organised under the auspices
of the Republican County Committee, a3
well as the cluba formed by the City Re
publican League, are busi]>v_engused in
the preparation of delegate tickets to be
voted for at the primary election August
S. At the headquarters of the league In
the. Grand Hotel the prediction Is made
That the league organizations in the va
rious mbly districts will elect a ma
jority of the delegates to the Republican
nominating convention. The prediction of
success is baaed on the ground that the
prosiest diligence has been employed to
soJeot representative citizens and taxpay
ers of character ajid influence for each
Assembly district ticket. Argument is ad-
variced thai the voters wil support the
league's ticket when they see the names
tnted.
The offlcera of the Republican County
Committee are equally conrtdent that thÂ«
regularly rganlzed clubs will win out. It
is limed that the best citizens in each
dlstr will bo placed before the peop:e.
The ntatives of the regular organi
zation assert that the enrollment of Ke
publicans is very large and the selection
of the delegate ticket is free from boss
methods and fluence. No doubt many
active young men. who are well and fa
vorably known in their respective districts
but not widely known in the city at large,
will be candidates to represent the people
in the convention. When the blanket
ticket was â  ected the proposition that
delegati should be elected at large was
aiso defeated, hence each district elects
1:5 own delegates to the convention. The
people comprising the district should be
able to judge of the merits of the men
brought forward to represent them. The
indications are that the Republican con
vention will be composed of able and
reputable men.
Jr. Democratic ranks affairs are badly
mixed. In many of the districts each of
The three contending factions will present
a list of oVlegateo to be voted for. The
Call is i formed that the Buckley follow
ers and the supporters of 'he Rain< y-
Kxaminer league have harmonized their
differences in the Twenty-ninth and
Thirty-eighth Assembly 'istricts, and as
a consolidated force will there fight the
tirket proposed by the Committee of < >ne
Hundred. In the Twenty-ninth Buckley
and Rainey ire openly fighting Braun-
A politician whn is well posted gives
this version of affairs in the Th;rty
eighth District: "George Gallagher, who
is controlled by Ralney; and Tim O'Brien,
v. ho was an oid-tirr.e Buckley lamb, have
induced many mwi to join a Phelan club,
'Windy' Powers and the McGueneys axe

â with Buckley. Hugo Asher, in Frank
l^ane's office, is a member "f the club.
lie pretend? to be . ir Phelan, but is in
fact a iney man. The programme is
t>> elect delegates ostensibly for Phelan,
but the delcgiiir!' when elected will be
controlled by Buckley and Rainey."
Democrats" who are on the "inside" were
amused when they read a postal card con
t.Uning this statement:

Thr true v-rsion as related to Th

was the only member from the precinct
in which he resided. He conceiyed i the
brilliant idea, that each precinct should j
recommend the name of a deleft" to the
convention, and proposed that the clut.
Should indorse the pla.n. He enlisted in
his cause the support of Kelly, a Dan
Burns appointee in the Board of Health.
The two rounded up others of their kind.
and one night when good citizen? of the
â  lub were off their guard the Mann propo
sition was put through. When the true
inwardness of the job was exposed the
citizens rallied, and on July 19 rescinded j
the action of Mann and Kelly. This ac- ]
counts for the unsigned demand byjpostal I
card for an anti-bo** club in the Forty
first District. The scheme to capture the
club wai" planned by the Rainey-Examiner
league, as Mann and Ralney are on confi
dential terms."
The executive committee of the Repub
lican Affiliated Clubs hold a quiet, private
session last evening and considered plan?"
for bringing opposing party elements to
gether in the selection of delegates to the
Republican convention. The attitude of
the Central league to the clubs was dis
cussed and a committee was appointed to
Bee v.hat could be done to f-erure the co
op< ration of the league In the coming pri
mary fight. Another meeting of the com
mittee will be held Monday evening. Six
clubs were represented last night.
The twenty-threo organizations com
prising the "Affiliated Republican <"lub&
contain a membership of 7000 roistered
voters. The-y were invited two weeks ago
t.i send representatives to a conference
with the <>ntraJ Republican T'lnlj at the
Grand Hotel and accepted the invitation.
The conference was a frank and open ois
cussion of political affairs in the various
districts. The Affiliated ('lubs invited a
return conference at the I'nlon LfaKÂ»fi
riuh rooms. A courteous letter was suit
to Z. U. Dodge askini? that five represen
tatives be sent from the <">ntral Club.
Tne return conference was not accepted
or declined. In fact the Affiliated <"ltibp"
officers did not receive the courtesy of a
reply to their communication.
There are signs of a big row in the
Thirty-eighth Assembly District Derno
cratjc Club, of which George Gallagher is
president. This clnb is composed " f
Raineyites, Buckle^itea and Democrats of
all kinds. Tlip original agreement was
that the delegates should be selected by
the precincts. The Buckley followers are
now suspicious th;tt Gallagher Intends to
give to the campaign committeemen in
< ach precinct such a roll of precinct vot
era as will contain the names only of
those in sympathy with the Rainey-Ex
ajnlner leapme. The- Buckley Democrat"?
yesterday tried to pet a copy of the pre
cinct enrollment but met with evasion.
The delegates selected must be ratified by
the club. There was great apprehension
among the Ruckleyites last night that a
.lugglcry of the rolls is intended. Should
the scheme to shut out the Buckley men
be persisted; in Uiere will be a great up

SMOOT PLAYS
PEEKABOO WITH
THE DETECTIVES
He Is Unable to Get
Bonds.
WILL LIE HID TILL HE DOES
SEVERAL SURETIES OFFEBJED
NOT UP TO THE MASK.
"Brick" McPherson, the Leader of
the Gang. Is Having an Irk
some Time of It in the
City Prison.
Saloon-keeper Smoot is still playing
peekaboo with the police. Contrary to
the express promise of his attorney,
Thomas Madden, Smoot failed yesterday
to deliver himself into custody. He was
very sorry to disappoint the patient de
tectives, he sent word, but business aa?
business with him, and he was firm in his
determination to avoid the warrant for his
arrest until such time as he could meet
it with a bail bond that would pass mus
ter. The bearer of the message Bought to
cheer up the depressed detectives with the
assurance that his man ought to be able
to get around to it by Monday morning.
The detectives thanked him for the con
sideration he had shown and requested
him to ask Smout to get a move <>n.
Smoot had been Retting a move on. but
it was barren of results. He whs confi
dent Friday thai as soon as collection
day passed he would have nn difficulty in
procuring a bond, in the good old days
b ;for< his name was connected so freely
with that of "Brick" McPherson and the
'â¢dope dream' gang he could have secured
the signatures of a dozen bondsmen that
would have passed muster. It is diffen-nt
now is the Larkin-street saloon-keeper
has found to his cost. Any old signature
will not do for a bail bond. Smoot's agents
submitted half a dozen names yesterday
to Bond Expert Newman and Police Judge
Treadwell bui not one of them would
pass muster. The smell of straw lingered
on all of them, and they were inconti
nently rejected.
Smoot's emissaries became discouraged
during the afternoon and decided to knock
off work in this direction until Monday
morning, when they are confident that
enough persons to represent $2000 worth <Â»f
property can be Induced to go bail for the
saloon-keeper now under cover.
Snmot is moved by a good reason in re
fusing to surrender until he lias his bond
. .Judging from the experience of
â¢'Brick " McPherson, any of the gang or
their connections, who land in jail is liable
to have a Bard time getting out. Mc-
Pherson's friends have tried it and they
know the difficulty of securing bondsmen.
The "dope dream" swindle has left such a
bad odor U-hmd it that no one is anxious
to mix with the swindlers. For that
reason "Brick" McPherson is still in the
City Prison, and. from the present out
look, will stay there until the law finishes
will) him.
Ex-Policeman Clisham, it now appears.
secured bail iust in time, or he. too. may
be, would have a hard time securing it.
Th police were informed yesterday that
the supposed Davis, accused oy Attorney
N. Thome of embezzlement, was
mixed v ( ' several years ago in a trans
action which bore all the earmarks of
bunko and shows that Clisham was no
novice In such operations as were, peculiar
to the "Brick" McPherson pang.
Early In 1897 Felix Pantoveris, who was
at that time secretary to the Greek Con-
BUI at this port, claimed that <"lisham
bunkoed him out of JLW on a. promise that
he would get. him a position in the <'lty
Hi I. On the discovery' that he had been
dupe-d. Pantoveris consulted Attorney A.
Ruef, and the outcome was a promissory
note fmnj CllÃham to Pantoveris for $100.
Pantov.ris is now a cook in a Saiisallto
restaurant.

THE CALL IS FIRST t
With the News of the Recom- t
mendations t
OF THE SAMOAN COMMISSIONERS.
The Call to-day presents information of preat importance to three
â¢ r>f Great Britain and that of Germany. Itcon
sists of the report of the Tripartite Commission sent to SamoaâJudge
ripp of Dakota, representing the United States; Baron Speck
yon Stcrnberg of the German Embassy, representing Germany, and C.
N. E. Eliot of the British Embassy, representing England â making
-.> recommendations regardinj; the new form of government de
I upon by them as most suitable for the islander?.
These recommendations are based on. the best features of the Berlin
treaty. The text of the treaty itself as amended and modified by the
Commissioners is also presented.
THIS IMPORTANT NEWS. IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF
THREE NATION'S ARE HIGHLY INTERESTED, IS NOW
FIRST MADE PUBLIC THROUGH THE CALL.
T], e â¢ ommissioners and the amended treaty
are ol â  to their respective Governments, bnt it will probably be
some time before any official announcements concerning the Commis
sioners' recommendations will be regularly given out to the- public.
REPORT OF THE
COMMISSIONERS
We have the honor to submit herewith ,
to the consideration of our thre* Govern- i
ments the inclosed draft of a modified |
and amended version of the act of Berlin, j
+.$, $^f In preparing
#. ' <*> these modifica-

MODIFItD. 1 what a re the evils
â¦-.: .- : __ t * which have
"* y * caused the recent
troubles in Samoa and the gen
erally unsatisfactory condition of the. Isl
ands, and. secondly, what are the meas
ures most likely to remove or minimize
those evils.
The chief <Â»vils may be. in our opinion,
grouped under four heads:
Iâ Those which appear to inevitably at
tend the election ol a King in Samoa and
his subsequent efforts to exert his author- j
Ity. I
â Those which are due to the rivalry of .
the foreign nationalities between them- ,
selves and to theii aisposition to take i
sides in the native politics, and thus in- i
crease the Importance and bitterness of
the disputes which arise.
3â A third ela?s of evils have their or!- i
gin in the fact that for many years there ;
has been no law or government in Samoa j
other than native custom outai.le the lim- j
its of the municipality. Murder and oth
er serious crimes have remained unpun
ished when committed by persons of rank. 1
and the Supreme Court and the nominal
Government at Mulinuu have been equally j
powerless to exert any controlling force. >
1 4â The insufficient enforcerm nl of the
customs regulation? has allowed unscrup- j
ulous traders to distribute targ numbers â 
of arms among a native population rent
by political factions and ready to right !
both one another and Europeans.
_i; t _ .4- romeet the first !
A ' ~ <*> of these cvi we I
i/iKi(;cuip T have temporarily I

<Â£> 4> tJon whi'-h we j
. . *â¢> have â  iken in the j
matter does not
appear to have aroused any hostile feel
ing among the natives.
No doubt, many great chiefs regrei that
they will no longer have an opportunity j
of gratifying tli<-ir mbitions and indulg
ing that passion for rank and ceremony
which Is innate In the breast of every
Samoan.
But even the chiefs li^ve acquiesced in
the change: some of the most Important ;
have star, d that they think it is for the
good of Samoa, and we believe that th*
population, unless worked upon by "xtra- \
neous influences (which Is, unhappily, not
impossible^ will assent to the abolition
without a murmur and without regret.
Every white man, German, English and
American alike, who has given evidence
before tlie commission (.with the exception
of one or two lawyers, who had private \
interests in the case) has recommended the
commission to do away with the kingship, '
and we may also refer to the opinion of
Sir E. Malet recorded In the protocols
of the conference of Berlin and of Mr.
Bates in his report on Samoa.

REVIEW OF THE SAMOAN SITUATION
Pioneer American Resident and Special Correspondent of The Call.
APIA. Samoa. July 14. -Since the arrival
of th" International Commission Mataafa
and thirteen chiefs who formerly consti
tuted the provisional Government have <m
all occasions demonstrated their friendli
ness, their desire for peace and their very
pronounced wish that the new Govern
ment of Samoa should be settled on equit
able lines.
On the other hand the few followers of
Tanu and Tama_seso. strongly supported
by a few British colonials, not one of
whom has any vested interests in the
country worth mentioning and all of whom
are merely place hunters, have raised
objections to every effort that the Com
missioners have made, even going so far
as to advise Tamasese to hold on to Muli
nuu (the capital) and to the house, usually
occupied by the President, thus in a meas
ure keeping Dr. Solp from commencing
his duties in a regular way. as all public
documents were locked up there.
On the 15th of last month the Commis
sioners decided that the continued pres
ence of Tanu in Samoa and the residence
of Tamasese to Mulinuu were detrimental
to the negotiations then pendlns for a
peaceful settlement. Tanu was ordered to
leave Samoa in the Torch for Fiji or any
other more distant point that he might
select, and Tamasese was ordered to go to
hIR home, at Leulomoega.
On the 17th Tanu's flag which had been
bo ceremoniously raised by Admiral Kautz
was ordered lowered, and Tamases<Â» de
parted for Mulinuu, but not to his home,
its own law and the Consul who adminis
tered that law was popularly regarded
not as an impartial judge but as the pro
tector of his own nationality.
We believe that by abolishing this out
ward sign of separate national Institu
tions and by submitting all nationalities
to one court and one law a great advance
will be made in the direction of removing
petty rivalries and jealousies and restor
ing good relations between- the various
white colonies.

other offenses were left unpunished, and
trade suffered owing to the difficulty of
affording planters adequate legal protec

We hope to improve this state of lnln;?s
by giving the Chief Justice an enlargtd
jurisdiction over all the islands, so as to
include all cases between natives and
foreigners as well as the higher grades
of crimes committed by natives against
each other.

Safata is situated across the range of
mountains and on the opposite side ot
I'ltniu from Apia. By land it Is fourteen
miles distant, by water forty. Suatele,
the principal chi<-f over there, had estab
lished on the very top of t lie range ;i sort i
of sanitarium, oprn freely to all persona
crisping, and very generally made use of
by both whites and natives.
About the houses he *Â»ad planted a
number of fruit trees and much taro an<l
other Samoan food plants. Besides this
he kept here a goodly number of fowl
and pigs. The place was at an elevation
of 3000 feet, the atmosphere cool and
bracing, and many persons. Including, of
course,. Its owner, came to this plac ! from
time to time as a port" of relief from the i
higher temperatures below at Apia on I
the one side and Safata on the other.
During the whole of the wars from Janu
ary 1 until April 28 this place escaped mo
lestation because the Mataafa forces un
der Suatele occupied the surrounding
country.
After the conclusion of the war, when
the Tanu men were promised protection
and ordered to their homes, some of them
belonging to Safata. in passing "TlavJ,"
as the place was known, utterly destroyed â 
everything there, of course burning the
houses to the ground.
On hearing- r.f this Suatele in a public i
speech at Safata, in which be counseled
a.ll persons to obey the voice of the com
mission and maintain the peace, expressed
his wish to be informed of the names of

they wore- in turn shot down by friends
of the wounded men and another of ih"ir

is believed that the man they had wound

mie of the wrestling and boxing

of the guests and crew were of a very

On this day and on hoard the Badger

j resignation, which was accepted. But on
i a subsequent day at his request he was
: granted a. leave of absence for two

Ex-King Malietoa Tanu.
resignation is to come into force. This
was dune evidently for the purpose of
allowing this gentleman to draw >^\o
months' extra salary to cover some
traveling expenses which were claimed.
i>n tho st h of July the Commissioners
left Apia on the Tntanekai to visit dif
ferent points In Savail which were un
suitable for such a large vessel as the
Badger to call at.
I'onos. or native gatherings, were held
at many places, and the usual compli- i
m'tits exchanged and all invited to come
to Mulinnu on the 14th inst. to hear read
the proposition* which the Commission-,
ers are to make to the treaty powers con- [
cerning the new art to govern Samoan j
matters. This meeting was also gotten up
for the purpose of a general reconcilia- !
tion when the contending factions were
supposed to again make friends. The
Commissioners were very anxious that
Mataafa should attend, bin it is very
doubtful if he will do so. T'p to the pres
ent he has declared that he is now and |
forever out of Samoan politics; that his ;
late chiefs will all personally attend the
meeting and faithtully carry out any !
engagements they may enter into, but !
that he cannot give, his hand in frienrt T I
ship to such men as Tamasese and Tanu,
for if he did so he would he acting with :
a lie in his heart. He has no wish to :
meet them, or ever to hear of them again.
Three times the Samoan people have
elected him King of Samoa by great ma- j
jorities. and each time by outside influ- i
once the wishes of the people have been j
thwarted; he has himself never desired j
the office, and hf shall never again under
anj circumstances allow his name to he
used in connection with it.
During th-? fonos held on Upolu the
Commissioners were very much impressed
with the difference in appearance between
the MaJietoan and Mataafan factions,
two of the < 'ommissioners openly saying
that there can he no question but that
the Mataafans are intellectually, morally,
numerically and even physically greatly
the superiors.
On the Sth Inst. Herr yon Billow, lately
connected with the Samoan disturbances,
arrived here on one of the interisland,
boats, but he was urged by the Oierman
Cunsul to depart again for Tonga and to
remain there until matters here were in
a more, settled condition.
It is expected that at the meeting which
takes place on Mulinuu to-day the native
chiefs will accept the greater part of thÂ«
suggestions offered by the < 'ommissioners
to the new government which they will
propose to thp powers. The natives will,
however, make this point: That the gov
ernment to be formed is more for the
beneiit and use of the, powers themselves
than for the natives; therefore, if heavy
salaries are to be paid as heretofore. th<*n.
they think the powers should themselves
pay a iust- portion of these charges.
Judge Milligan and W. Cooper are gPt
ting together all the evidence con^ernlne
the losses and damages occurring during
the latf hostilities, and it is believed that
the commission will recommend that all
honest claims should be paid.
An absurd rumor was spread a few days
ago to the effect that chief Justice cham
bers had been asked to remain here some
time longer by the Commissioners. I have,
unw the permission of one of the Com
missioners to say (and this story will be
published both in England and in Ger
many) that some days ago the commis
sion learned that Mr. Chamber? was
heard to announce thai he would stay
here yet another month.
Commissioner Tripp at once called upon
him and in a pleasant way said: "Well.
Chief Jusiice. r suppose you are getting
ready to leave us?" whereon the latter is
reported as saying: "I don't sec juÂ«t how
1 can do so this month; there are so many
things yet to do. In justice to others T
think [ OUffbi to stay over till August."
On this Mr. Tripp is reported to have di
roctl> told Mr. Chambers that it was
necessary for him to be plain and to ?av
that the Commissioners could not think of
leaving him here after their departure.
that his presence was detrimental to any
peaceful settlement: that all over Samoa
wherever the commission had h<->en there
scfnicd to be a general demand for Mr.
â¢ 'hampers' removal, and that the commis
sion had so far as it could protected him
and did not feel that they should take any
more chances in the matter. After this
plain talking Chambers found that he
could not do those very important thing*
he had designed by working overtime and
running his court on the continuous per
formance plan.
A number of important matters have
thus been rushed through, regardless of
results so long as the friends of the re
tiring Justice would be served, and there
is not the slightest doubt that most if not
all of these matters will be heard again.

Royal Reception for
the Heroes.
THE COMMITTEE AT WORK
NAVAL PARADE THAT WTLL BE
ON A GRAND SCALE.
Stroets Illuminated by Electricity
for a Night Festivalâ To
Protect Warriors'
Valuables.
If the California volunteers now on their
way home from the Philippine Islands do
not receive a royal reception upon their
arrival home It will be on account of
something unforeseen happening. It is
going: to take money, time and thougrht to
make their homecoming one of the great
events in California history, but these
will be liberally expended. ThÂ© special
committed appointed by the Board of Su
pervisors to receive the volunteers met
yesterday. Mayor Phelan, A. M. Law
rence, W. J. Martin and Secretary McPike
being present. The subject of finances
wae well discussed. Mr. Martin ptated
that the reception to the returning sol
dUÂ»rÂ« of the Golden Westâ and of all sec
tions, for that matter â should be one in
keeping 1 with the well-esta-blished reputa
tion of this State of never doing things
by halves. For all purposes nt least $50.
--000 will be necessary, and all members of
â oclety should have an opportunity to con
tribute to the fund. As the matter had
been presented to many, the following
gentlemen agreed to serve as a finance
oommittee, to solicit funds from the or
ganizations and bodies which they repre
sent:
R. J. Tobln, Police Department;
Commissioner Bohen, Fire Depart

Organizations not hero nainr-d will be I
recognized soon, and committees selected
therefrom. There was much discussion as
to the features of the reception, and it i
wns decided that there should be a naval '
parade of all of the craft on thÂ»- bay
tbat can be brought into line upon the ;
trrival of the transports. Also that there
will be a night parade, which for grandeur:
Bhall excel anything that has ever been !
witnessed in this city. Electrical effects;
â will form no small part of the attractions
along the line of march. Mayor Phelan
suggested that the arrival of the troop
ships might be most inopportune for the â 
arrangements of the committee, and that
the water craft would not learn that their !
cc was desired in time to escort the
ships in. Mr. Laurence remarked that
should be arranged by securing an ;
order from the transport department to
the pilots to 1."!'! the incoming- vessels
outside f.ir two hours.
Secretary McPlke called attention to the
arrival .if General < irn r. t years ago, when
BO warning was given, yet the people were
ready and did pive him a timely reception.
From what was stat>>,i there Is no doubt
but what three big ferry boats will be se- I
cured to carry passengers in the naval '
parade. It was agreed to sell the tickets
fur a trip on these vessels at 00 cents j
each, and this will add a considerable sum :
to the fund. At least $5000 will be re-
Quired to make the naval parade a sue- |
oss. and about $2'Â»"0 is now in sight. In I
order that th^ naval feature may be un- j
d>-r a responsible head It was decided to j
request the Board of Harbor Commission
ers, through Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Me-
Pike, to attend to this matter.
T'pon a resolution by Mr. Martin, It was
decided to send invitations to the Mayors
and members of the Common Councils of;
Oakland. Berkeley, Alameda, San Jose,
Bausalito and San Rafael to participate !
In the celebration. Similar invitations will i
be sent to all fraternal organizations. C.
M. Troppman ar:d Police Sergeant Green,
on account of having several sons among
the volunteers, were added to the recep- j
tion committee. Attention was called to
a mistake In regard to headquarters,
which will be established In Union square
Instead of Golden Gate Park. Two large
t^nts will be erected, where all business
will be transacted. A big Hall safe is to |
be placed in one of th*>sv tent? for the re- '
caption of the money collected by the :
committee, and, more important, for the
pafe keeping of the money and valuables !
of returning soldiers.
About 20,000 soldier warriors will be mils- i
ter*>d out here, and they should have some !
place for the safe keeping of their money, j
SO that when they decide to leave!
to-xn they will be provided with funds. !
Otherwise many would lose their money â 
and be in straitened circumstances when !
the time came for them to go away. The
next meeting will be held on Tuesday at
4 p. m. In the Mayor's office.

Chinatown Inspection.
Dr. William Lawlor of the Board of
Health has taken decisive action on the
cases of bad sanitation reported to him
by the squad of police and health inspect
ors at present engaged In Chinatown. Yes
terday he issued notice to property owners
In that section whose properties have
been reported that they must
beerln necessary improvements witJi
in sixty hours or suffer arrest. While the
sanitary condition of the Chinese quarter
lp much better than for years past, there
is still much room for improvement. Some
frightful- cases have been reported, and
these Dr. Lawlor is resolved to remedy.
DISHEARTENED
MINERS RETURN
FROM SAN ROQUE
Reached Here on the
Steamer Curacao.
HEALTH AUTHORITIES EVADED
CAPTAIN MEYER. OF THE JOHN
C. POTTER DID IT.
Philo Tryon Injured at the Ferries.
Z. C. S. Bowman Broke His
Jjtig While on His Way
to St. Luke's.
The frozen north Is not the only place
that gold hunters are returning from with
tales of woe. Some came back yesterday
from the torrid plains of San Rogue on
the steamer Curacao. They say the place
is nothing but a "tailings camp, " and a
man is doing well who makes $1 50 a day.
The Curacao brought up forty-seven
cabin and thirty-seven second-class pas
sengers. Among them were Merceliiis
Herriaa and Jose Somelhera, wealthy
merchants of Enscnada, who are here on
business and pleasure. They say the San
Rogue boom Is dead and that very few
people are loft on the field outside of those
who were there when the rush began.
W. W. Lrfjwis and C. H. Junker are two
! of the miners who came back on the Cura
i cao. Mr. L*wie has a small quantity of
: gold in a glas vial, which he brought
home with him as a curiosity. The gold
Is worth about $2 75, and it took Mr. Lew-
Is three weeks to pan it out of the San
Rogue sand. Mr. Junker Is crippled with
rheumatism, and that is all he has to
i show for his gold hunt in Mexico. Both
these men have been In placer mines in
almost every gold countr> on the face or
the earth, and both are unanimous in
saying that San Rogue is the worst spot
i they ever struck.
"There were only about fifteen Ameri
â  cans left on the tield when we left." said
Mr. Lewis yesterday. "All the remainder,
' to the number of 5W or tWO. were Mexicans
or Indians. There would have been a
| great deal of suffering had not the Mcxi
! can Government sent the gunboat De.mo
crata to take us away. On her last trip
she landed about 100 of us at Ensenada.
i and from there we have made our way
home.
"The Mexican Government made no
charge for mining. They sent an expert
and he reported the fields as worked out.
There is no doubt that years ago San
Koque was one of the richest placer min
ing camps the world has known, but it
has been worked and worked, until now
there Is nothing left but the tailings.
There was no suffering except for water.
That article was bad and very hard to
get. It was carried to the <-amp on mules
and it cost me 33 1-3 cents a day for what
1 used. That was more than 1 ever took
out of the ground In one day. The most
I ever saw taken out at one time was $!S
worth of dust. It was got fn>m the roots
of an uprooted tree. Next day the miner
took out $â¢> worth and the next day he
could not get anything.
"The Mexican Government was very
good to everybody at the mines. There
were a great* many poor people idle ami
It was thought they might njakr a living
at San Rnque. When it saw that the
place was overdone, the Democrata came
and took us away. I don't want any more
San Koque in mine."
Dr. L. Eiaen, who has been in Lower
California for the Academy of Sciences,
also returned on the Curacao. Dr. Els^n
brings back with him a very valuable col
lection of natural history objects. H
shis there has been no rain in the cet
tral part of Lower California for fou
years, and everything would have dlÂ» â¢
nad it not been for irrigation. He dU
not visit the San Rogue goldnelds, bu
he heard enough of them from disap
pointed gold hunters wnom he met at va
rlous points during his travels.
There was a rush of people tn the wate
front yesterday morning. Some aenseles
person notified the Eureka planing mill
that one of the transports was comin
in, and in consequence the siren wa.
blown. All the other whistles on the fror
took up the refrain and soon thousand
of people were asking what transport wa
coming In. For three hours the clerk
at the Merchants' Exchange were kep
busy answering telephone calls and teil
lng'people that it was a false alarm and
no transport was in sight.
Captain Meyer of the American ship
John C. Potter did a very clever piece
of work the other day and Incidentally
outwitted the Honolulu Board of Health.
The Potter was loaded and cleared at the
Custom-house, but was short two of her
crew. Captain Meyer seeurud these on
Saturday afternoon and notified the doc
tor to come down and give him a bill of
health. The medico had an important en
gagement, but nevertheless went to the
Potter. When he got there the two men ]
had not arrived, so the doctor departed.
saving he would give the bill of health
on" Monday. This did not suit the cap
tain, and when his men came aboard he
sailed without It.
The health authorities at Honolulu were
anerv over the sailing of the Potter, and
at once notified the Collector of Customs ;
at Port Townsend. The agent of the yes- f
pel applied for a clean bill of health to
forward to Captain Meyer, but it was
refused him. Meyer suspected that he
â would have trouble, so when he. reached
Port Townsend he kept the tugboat along
side the ship. Going ashore he tele
graphed to Captain Charles Nelson, the
owner to find out If the bill of health
had arrived. When informed that It had
not he went aboard and ordered tne tug
to take him to Victoria. B. C. A few
hours later the John C. Potter was in the .
capital of British Columbia, and there- j
Meyer entered his ship. He explained his
failure to have a bill of health and then j
took the statutory oath, paid a small fine. ;
and everything wa* all right Ihen he
turned around and cleared his ship for
Port Townsend. The tug was still along
side the Potter, and back she went to her
destination. Captain Meyer had lost a
day, and had to pay a pretty heavy tow
age bill, but he was able to enter his ship
without any more ado. Had he tnÂ«d to
enter bin vessel at Port Townsend with
out the clean bill of health he would have
been liable to a fine of $5000.
The training ship Adams w<-nt to the
navy yard yesterday. Several of che offi
cers are to be examined for promotion,
and as soon aB that work Is over the
Adams will go on another crul3e '.o Puget
I'hilo Tryon, a grlpcnan on a McAllister
street car 'met with a peoullar accident at
the ferries yesterday. He was about to
take hold of the cable with the grip when
a flvlng strand caught the grip and .i-jrked
it hack with terrific force. It struck
Tryon in ihe stomach and knocked him
clean through the car door. He was badly
injured, and was treated at the Harbor
Hospital by Dr. Morrison.
Z. C. S. Bowman, a commercial trav
eler, had a broken leg set at the Harbor
Hospital by Dr. Morrison yesterday, and
was then sent to St. Luke's Hospital. Mr.
Bowman's wife has been dangerously ill
at St. Luke's with typhoid fever, md her
husband on his return from a trip into
the country was hurrying out to hta her.
He stepped off a car on Markr-t street to
attend to some urgent business, and in
doing so put his foot on an orange peel;
result, a broken leg and a trip to the hoe
pital In an ambulance.
The British bark Venture arrived from
Hamburg yesterday after a passage of 17:!
days. Captain J. F. T. Ahrens Is in com
mand. He cannot speak English, and the
Venture lÂ» one of the few British ships
that haÃ come Into this port whose mus
ter could not speak the language of the
flag under which he Failed.

History of the Congregational Church
and the Good Work Accom
plished Told in Speeches
and Essays.
Yesterday was the fiftieth anniversary
of the establishment of the First Congre
gational Church In this city, and pastor
and members and friends of tha church
united in making it a day of general re
joicing. The sacred edifice was gayly
decked with a wealth of yellow blossomsâ
emblematic of the golden Jubilee â and i
everywhere that the artistic eye could ;
suggest were great growing palms and
ferns. In the midst of aJI this floral love
liness were suspended the portraits of The
pastors of the church, who had safely
guided it from the modest beginning, a
half century ago, to its prosperous state
of to-day.
The expreises opened yesterday after- j
noon at 2 o'clock with a prayer meeting-, j
led by Deacon D. Gilbert Dexter. After j
Psalm lXi the choir followed, chanting: j
the Lord's Prayer. Then there was a j
prayer led by Mr. Atkinson, the singing
of Psalm 23 and a prayer by Rev. Dr. i
Wllley. After the prayer meeting fol- j
lowed a series of papers pertaining to |
"Woman's Work and How It Was Don.?."
The first paper submitted was written by
Mrs. J. 11. Warren and read by Mrs. J.
McDonald. Mrs. Warren was the third
woman to Join the church, and her paper
was tilled with interesting reminiscence?.
Mrs. Warren's description of the old
"First Church" on Virginia street, off
Jackson, between Stockton and Powell,
was extremely picturesque. In the course
of hf-r paper iMrs. Warren paid a glowing
tribute to Mrs. Hunt, wife of the first
pastor of the church.
After Mrs. Warren's paper Mrs. K. C.
Pike read a touching- eulogy in memory
of Mrs. Sarah Cooper, and was followed
by Miss Myrtle Simpson, who told of the
food accomplished by the Helping Hand
ociety under the splendid management
of Mrs. D. W. Folger.
Mrs. Dr. Charlotte Brown's pajjer, which
told of the many charities of the church,
concluded the afternoon programme. A.
pleasant feature of the occasion was the
reading of letters from former and al-.seni
members, all of whom in tender words
sent sincere congratulations.
At o o'clock the members of the church
met In the church basement and enjoyed
the banquet given under the auspfr>~Â» of
the hospitality committee, of which" Mrs.
D. W. Folger is chairman. At the ban
quet was present D. N. Hawley, the only
living charter member of the First
Church. At the banquet board there w<?r<Â»
speerhmaking and songs of praise. D. N
Hawley told of "The Beginnings"; ff. i 3 |
Hudson spoke of "The Truth of '43" : ;
Deacon George Harris gave some "Middle
IJfe Reminiscences"; S. F. Rarstow spoke
of "The Young People of the '60's " and
George B. Ltttlefield told about "The
Young People of the Eresent." Deacon
J. H. Barnard looked after "The Ladies "
a subject to which he did full justice.
The praise and jubilee exercises will be I

LABOR COUNCIL TRIES
TO CHECK AN EVIL
PBOTEBT AND APPEAL BENT TO
ALL GOVERNORS.
The Crime and Horror of Disbanding
Troopi in Thia City Set
Forth.
The San Francisco Labor Council has
â¢ent the following protest and appeal to
every State whence soldier* have been
sent to the Philippines:
SAN FRANCISCO LABOR COUNCIL*
Affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor, 1159 Mission street.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 28. 1899.
To the Governor and Cltlaena of â â -
Dear 81r and Fellow Citizens: The War De
partment has decided to muster out all tne
returning volunteers at Ban Francisco, requests
and appeals of the people of the respective
States who asked that the troops be disbanded
In the States they came from having been^ dis
regarded. Now the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil, the federation of the trades unions of tms
city, calls your attention to the evifc inevitably
to result should the War Department adhere to
Its announced policy, in the hope that a public
sentiment will be aroused strong enough to
compel the administration to listen to common
sense and plain reason.
The strange action of the department In this
matter can be explained only by inferring the
following motives, which conditions compel us
to note: First, the desire to unduly flood the
labor market and thus check the struggle of
the worklngmen for improved conditions; sec
ondly, to compel the volunteers, driven by
want and destitution, to re-enllst: thirdly, to
prtÂ»\ ent the return of the volunteers to their
homes, where to their friends and relatives
they would undoubtedly give the true version
of the people, the climate and the general con
ditions in the Philippines as produced by our
war of conquest.
The great majority of the returning volun
teers, when paid off. wll' quickly epend their
moneyâ they have the soldier spirit and de
sires and are young, and San Francisco has the
reputation of being able and willing to furnish
"to the stranger within Its gates" Irresistible
attractions. With money gone, the destitute
soldiers will be compelled to seek work, which
they, in most casrs. will not be able to find.
I Then want and suffering will be their lot. for
i the conditions for securing employment In
| fnn Francisco and vicinity are different from
â¢ those In the F.astern and Middle States, there
i being no other industrial centers within easy
1 reach that could absorb surplus labor. It Is
I hard to beat the trains in the West, the rall
! roads putting off men c-ompelled to steal a
: ride on mountains and In dpserts, where they
i often miserably perish. It Is certain that the
| railroad corporations will show no more pity
I for the soldier tramp than thpy do for the
I workman trajnp. Anil those fortunate enough
I to sfcure employment here will have to take
it at lower wages, throwing out of work the
i local workmen, who In most cases with families
J to support In turn would become tramps and
! ouft'erers. Twenty-five thousand men thrown
>n to San Francisco In a few months will
eauf-e a congfstion of the labor market, with
; Its inevitable hardships; distributed through
1 the respective States they would be uselul and
'â  hÂ«ne!lcial to themselves and their fellow-clti-
zens.
llany of, the volunteers, If discharged r*erÂ«.
I will die. Destitute, without family ties and
, the sentiment of the majority of the people
; turned against them, when It Is found th.it
they are underbidding local workmen, the Â«ol
d.era. enfeebled through the hardships In a
deadly climate, will miserably perish in cheap
lodglrg-houses, In overcrowded hospitals end
on lonely country roads.
Some, driven to desperation, will re-enllst. to
ficht. against their own convictions, In a use
loss and endless war. Then Philippine swamps
an.i Filipino bullets will finish thu work of de
struction.
The censor In the Philippines now forbldj the
publication of all news that would Bho-.V up
the horrors of the war nnd the tremer.doj.s
sacrifices the people of this country will have
to make to conquer a warlike people, solely
for the exploitation by carpet-baggers and
corporations. Returned 'to their homes, the
volunteers would quickly make known to the
American people the real conditions In the
Philippines, and a death-knell would soon be
sounded on the un-American policy of conquest
and bluster.
Mr. Governor, will the people of your State
permit the War Department to add this crime
to the horrors of Camp Chlckamauga, Camp
Merritt and of embalmed beef? . Let us assure
you that these horrors will pale into inÃlgnlfl
cance with thrse to result from the dlsband
nient of all the volunteers In San Francisco.
i We ask you to use your utmost influence on
: the administration to change its present policy
regarding the mustering out of volunteers. We
â  appeal to the fathers, mothers, wives, brothers,
i sisters and friends of the volunteers to work
! and pray for the direct return of their loved
'â  ones. If our appeal falls there will be untold
suffering In the State of California; there will
be anguish and pain in "very State that sent
her sons to fight. Mr. (Jovernor and fellow
cltlzens. let your protest and appeal be heard
. loud and strong and persistent.. J
Under misrepresentation from selfish and In
terested parties, some of the volunteer regiments
; have asked to be mustered out in San Fran
'. Cisco, thus supporting the War Department in
; its criminal policy. When the volunteers real
ize what Is in store for them here they will
' add their voice to yours for a discharge at
home. Ask their friends and relatives to at
once communicate with them. Only prompt
I action can save crime and horror.
Trusting that this appeal of the working men
I and women of San Francisco will receive your
careful consideration, and then hearty co
operation. I am. by order of the San. Francleco
Labor Council, yours sincerely.
ED ROSENBERG,
Recording and Corresponding Secretary.

GERMAN COMMENT
ON THE ARENS CASE
Liberal Papers Support the Action of
the Faculty in Dismissing
the Matter.
BERLIN, July 29.â The press of Berlin i
s much attention to the Arens case. |
Dr. Arens is a professor who lectured on j
physics In the Berlin University and Is a
presence in the
university has given great offense to all j
favorable to drastic measures for com
bating socialism. The Diet passed a law
g . called by the pr< ss the Arens
law, making It possible for th* Govern
ment to proceed against and dismiss so
ciallsi professors. I'nder this the philo
sophical faculty a week nun tried Profes
sor Arens and unanimously declared that
they saw n<> occasion to tak>' action.
tea attorney appealed the case
to the Ministry, who, it is regarded c.-r
--tain. will dismiss Professor Aretis. The j
papers of all parties discuss the case
at great length. The . fsan-German
che Zeltung says the faculty of Ber- ;
[In University has shown the same in-
Ity for consideration of the state
affairs that was shown by some profes- !
sors in treating the Danish question last i
year. !
The Kreuz Zcitung reproaches the fac
ulty with holding- that social democrats
should be treatr-d on an equal footing with
other parties and formulates the attitude
of the conservatives as follows:
â¢â¢it Is Impossible to treat a party that :
res war upon the state and the ex- j
lstinp order as having the same political
rights as other parties."
The Dresdener Nachrichten re-echoes
this sentiment, adding that the days of
political equality for socialists is against'
THiblic welfare, and hence it is the duty
of Judges everywhere to take into account
this fact In the administration of justice, j
The liberal papers side with the faculty,
hi 'Ming that their dr-cision was the only
one consistent with the freedom of unl
v. :.-jiy instruction. The Centrist pre?s

member of Kernville Lodge No. 251, Ir.de

â¢ th< sight of his eyes by an explo

afflicted, and continued to do so to the
limit of its financial ability, 'but there
came a time when that lodge was unable
to continue its existence, and it appealed
to thÂ« relief committee for assistance.
This body cheerfully took up the burden
and continued to give relief until Borne
time ago, when by one of those sudden
changes in the forttu.es of m m there was
one in favor of Sargentson, who was
known In the order as "Blind Mob," and
he realized upon what many years before
he thought was a very poor Investment.
Recently he passed away, his remains
were laid at rest by the <>'M Fellows, and
'; it was then learned that he had. in grat
| itude for all the kindness shown him In
his affliction, left by will the sum of $1000
to the odd Fellows' Home at Thermalito,
to be used for the benefit of those aged
I members of the order who turn to that
haven when they are no longer able to
battle with the world.

ALAMEDA COUNTY
HENRY WEBER PASSES
TO THE GREAT BEYOND
OAKLAND, July 29.â Henry "Weber, well known in Alameda County as
a public-spirited citizen, died last night in bis home at Temescal, from
the effects of a stroke of apoplexy with which he was stricken early
yesterday morning.
Weber had just fcissed his wife and left her room to go to his daily toil.
He busied himself in his bakery shop on Telegraph avenue and Forty-third
street when he was suddenly overcome by a sudden rush of blood to his
head. He fell prostrate before his brother, who was with him at the time,
could reach him.
The stricken man was quickly carried to his bed and Dr. J. P. Dunn sum
moned. Weber passed away about 11 o'clock, unconscious and surrounded
by his entire family.
The deceased was a prominent politician, busying himself with the affairs
of the community and accomplishing much ty better municipal conditions.
He worked honestly and consistently for the annexation of outside districts.
One of his most earnest labors was directed toward the attainment of a good
sewer system for Telegraph avenue. Not long agn he appeared before the
City Council and pleaded for an immediate improvement of the sewerage and
water system of TemescaL He claimed that it would not surprise him if
any or all of his ten cttlldren were suddenly stricken down by the foul, pes
tilential odors which arose from the defective system in that district. The
address made a profound impression on the board.
Weber was 42 years of age and leaves a widow ami ten children. His
iove for liN family was Btrong and he is deeply mourned by his sorrowing
family as well as by his many friends, some of whom have felt his kindly
hand of charity.

on his farm near this city.. Miss Nellie
Berger agreed to accompany him, and the
two drove a*way together. Failing within
a day or two to bear of their daughter,
the parents began making inquiries, and
they discovered that there was no such
farm as the one described by the stranger,
and that he had driven in an opposite di
rection, abandoning the horse and buggy
at Illion. in Marshall County, after which
the girl and man both disappeared.
Lasi evening a man supposed to be the
abductor was seen In the timber eight
miles from this city by ponjf berry pick
ers. A girl was with him. and she evi
dently made an effort to escape to the
women. The man used such violent lan
guage that they were frightened away.

patrolling the road surrounding the tim
ber, which Is i"Â° acres in extent along
th<-- banks of the Tippecanoe River. Blood
bounds have been secured, and a careful
search la being made. Th^re is talk of

TO INSPECT THE VALLEY ROAD.
H. C. Short, general traveling agent of
the Santa Fe system, arrived in this city
from Chicago yesterday morning. He will
remain here about two weeks and will
make a thorough examination of all per
taining to the Valley road. He expects to
complete a tour over all of that tine that
is thus far completed and to thoroughly
acquaint himself with the work that baa
b( iii done hs well as that now In prog
r> 88, and the plans of improvement that
have been deafened for the future. Fin
ishing with the Valley road, Mr. Sh-.rt will
proceed to Los Angeles, where be will
make a like Inspection of all the property
belonging to the Santa Fe.
The officials of the Pennsylvania road
have decided to show their appreciation of
the valor displayed by th>' volunteers from
their State by carrying the returning he
roes to their homes in a manner that wii!
leave no room for either complaint or
criticism. The men will be carried across
the continent in good shape, and nothing
which may tend to their comfort will be
left undone.
This action is in strong contrast with
the treatment being meted out to the men
of Oregon. All that the men from that
State know of the plans made to carry
them to their homes is that the rate will
be $9 50 per man.
Slashed With a Knife.
Edward Welch, a soldier of the casual

hospital say the wound is clearly that of

Gripman Frank Mott
Attempts Suicide.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 29.
Because his attentions paid to a buxom
Monde servant girl residing in Fruitvale
' found favor no longer. Frank Mott. form
erly a gripman on the old San Pablo av
enue cable line, attempted to end his life
this afternoon at 808 San Pablo avenue by
cutting his left wrist with a sharp razor.
Groans emanating from his rooms at
tracted the attention of his landlady, Mrs.
Lizzie. M. Coakley, and she promptly
forced open the door and found her
roomer lying on his bed with blood spurt
ing from an ugly gash across the wrist.
The police were notified and Mott was
quickly removed to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Dr. Rowe and Steward Bor
(1m rt applied every means to save the
would-be suicide's lifp. All the arteries of
1 the left arm at the wrist were severed and
taking into consideration the man's weak
condition from l"ss of blood the doctors
1 were not very sanguine of saving him.
j They worked over him several hours,
i however, and to-night he is resting as
easily an can be expected. He was not
strong enuiigh at any time during his
treatment to state a reason for his rash
tit tempt at suicide, but those who know
him best attribute his desire to die to dis
-1 appointment in love.
Mott gained considerable unenviable
notoriety last May as the result of a per
sonal encounter with Miss Kliza Schom
berg, a servant girl, at the law office of
Attorney Hugh Aldric-h. On that occa
sion it was stated that he drew a revolver
on the young woman. He was afterward

Bault upon her was the climax of her re
fusal to loan her lover any more money,

Samoan Commissioners' Recommendation

ing that they migrht in some way increase
their trade or provide places for their
office-seekers to fill.
The statement so often made of the
great preponderance of British interests
is almost laughable.
There is not in Samoa a British business
house paying better than a third-class li
cense. Britishers import less than 5 per
cent of the goods entering the port, and
export nothing at all. They pay less than
6 per cent of the licenses and other taxes
collectible.
If Chinese hailing from Hongkong. East
and West Indians of mixed breeds, and
half-caste children, were to be excluded i
the numbers of so-called Britishers would !
be seriously reduced.
Ninety per cent of the trade of Samoa is I
carried on by (Germans and Americans.
the balance by Scandinavians, Frenchmen '
and Britons in the order named. A point
is made of the fact that a large proportion
of the imports comes from British colo- |
nies. But it is a well-known fact that j
goods from Germany and other European
points coming over the Sydney routes are
Figured up in their returns as British or
Colonial manufactures, and not properly
accredited to the countries producing
them. Further than that, but for the i
very high freights and infrequent commu- I
nioation with the United States a very ;
large proportion of this trade would come [
from San Francisco. As the Spreckelses j
are now designing a fortnightly service in *â 
the near future, and the use of more com
modious steamers, no reasons should ex
ist why the present high freight rates
should longer continue to the general det
riment of American trade.
It is thought that the commission will
be ready to leave here by the 20th lnst. j
Before leaving it is hoped they will settle
matters on some better basis than the |
provisional arrangement so ineffective at j
present.
As a good number of whites (every one
of them disappointed British colonials) are
loudly talking of the native troubles
which will quickly follow the departure
of the commission, it looks to the writer I
as if some understanding has been ar- j

advisable, and upon the nomination of
th- natives in each district to appoint a
Governor, who shall be charged with thÂ«
' collection of all taxes and with the main
ti-nance of peace and good order within
his district.
The local government of such districts
shall be left, bo far as may be, to be
administered by the natives themselves,
i in accordance with the laws and customs
of Samoa.
ARTICLE IV.
A DECLARATION AS TO LEGISLA
TIVE POWERS.
1 The legislative power shall be vested
In the Administrator and Legislative
Council The Council shall consist or
three members, one of whom shall be ap
j pointed by the United States, one by the
! empire of Germany and one by the United
1 Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
The Administrator and Council shall
constitute a legislative body, of which the
Administrator shall be the President. He
shall have a voice in considering and a
vote in determining all questions that may
come before it.
Three of the four members composing
the legislative body shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business.
Provided, however, that no law shall be
enacted and that no rule or regulation
having the force of law shall be made
without the concurrence of at least three
members in open session. __ '
The legislative power of the Adminis
trator and Council shall extend to all
rightful subjects of legislation, and in
particular they shall have power to levy
and collect such taxes, duties, imposts
and excises "as may be necessary for the
public revenues, and for this purpose they
shall have power to change and modify
the taxes, duties, imposts and excises pro
vided for in this act.
They shall have power to establish post
offices, post roads and a uniform postal
system. They shall have power to es
tablish municipal and district govern
ments and to limit and define their
powers.
But the throe great powers reserve to
themselves at all times the right and
power to modify or annul any legislative
act of the Samoan government.
2. The members of the Legislative Coun
cil shall also constitute an Executive
Council, which shall from time to time
counsel and advise the Administrator in
his executive capacity as may be required.
The members of the Legislative and Ex
ecutive councils shall also, when desig
nated by the Administrator, act in the
capacity of Assessor and Collector of Cus
toms and Revenues; Treasurer. Attorney
General and such other executive officers
of the Government as may be provided
for.
They may also, if required, act in the
capacity of consuls or consular agents
of their respective governments. .
3. There shall be a Native Assembly
composed of the Governors of the differ
ent districts of the islands. The mem
bers of the Native Assembly shall hold
their office for three years, but the Ad
ministrator shall have power to dismiss
any of them for misbehavior. The Na
tive Assembly shall meet annually at Mu
llnuu at such time as may be designated
by the Administrator, but such session
rived at to encourage the dissatisfied
Tanu people to revolt at an early date in
the hope of invoking: British interference
in some form or other.
Last evening John George Leigh of the
London Times, who has made this Samoan
trouble a close study, felt it his duty to
point out to the British Commissioner that
It would be most inexpedient for him to
leave Samoa until he had very solemnly
warned his disgruntled nationals that in
case they, or any one of them, fomented
trouble after the departure of the com
mission heavy punishments would follow.
The German and American Commis
sioners have worked together in great
harmony since their arrival, but the Brit
ish Commissioner, who had the idea that
his country should take over the group,
peems to be a very disappointed man. The
understanding that Chambers' decision in
the lute kingship case "should be consid
ered as valid and binding" was rendered
because the Berlin general act left m>
other resource but this. This by no means
meant that that decision, which was au
mittedly wrong, should ever be enforced.
Tanu was at once retired â without recom
pense or notice and very nearly exiled.
An abortive attempt was made by a few
Britishers to get up some sort of a good
by demonstration in honor of Mr. Cham
bers, but for lack of suocort it fell
through. I have not heard of a single
American who took any part in this move
ment.
Satisfactory progress has been made by
the Healy-Tibbitts Company at Pago
Pago, and it is likely that the Cardigan
Castle has already left that harbor, as
when last heard of some few days ago her
cargo was practically discharged.
A very heavy copra crop has been pro
duced this year and business Is corre
spondingly much improved.
I'nder the new government it is hoped
that the acquirement of lands by for
eigners from native owners will not be as
entirely barred as under the Berlin gen
eral *act. Still much good property is still
for sale at reasonably low rates and on
fair terms. The general health is, as usual,
excellent.
shall not continue for a longer time than
thirty days in any one year, except for
reasons approved by the Administrator.
The Native Assembly shall be presided
over by the Chief Justice or some other
white official designated by the Admin
istrator, but the president so designated
shall not have a vote, and Ills functions
shall be merely to control and direct the
proceedings of the Assembly with a view
to the dispatch of business. The Native
Assembly shall be empowered to deal with
the organization of district government,
Including native courts and generally
with all questions which affect natives
only. Its resolutions and recommenda
tions shall be referred to the Adminis
trator and Legislative Council, who shall
approve, disapprove or return them with
â¢such modifications as they may deem
proper. Provided always that no reso
lution or other action of the Native As
sembly shall have any binding force or
effect until the same shall have been ap
proved by the Administrator and Legis
lative Council.

EASTERN MARKETS. *
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YOTIK. July 29.â The stock mar; for j
to-day's short session was strong. A large I
volume of realizing was well digested by rea- j
son of an Increased demand. Commission
houses and the market stood up well under a \
bank statement that was unexpectedly weak, ]
the majority of stocks showing net sali; when I
trading was over for the day. London contin- ;
ued to buy- storks her* with eonsiderabl< con- i
ndence and this was the prime factor in the j
pentng ri=e ard In the further decline In ster- ;
linfr exchange raiÂ°s. The money market was j
largely nominal, but there Is evidence of quite
liberal offerings of funds from outside sources. !
The high level of railroad earnings shown by j
all companies reporting and the reporte . eager j
demand to buy. borrow or rÂ«>iH freight cars i
from many sections of the country was a ;
potent bource of strength lor stocks. Northern i
Pacific, Pennsylvania md Pittsburg C. C, C !
and St. Louis enjoyed the benefit of the pub- i
Honed June statements, showing largely In- â 
creased net earnings. Burlington's strong
June statement brought realizing. The coalers :
were helped by the statement of Lehigh Val- ;
ley, refit-ding a growing nprovement in the
long depressed tuthraclte Industry. Reports j
of the unprecedented activity and strength in !
thÂ° Iron trade caused advances in the prices I
of Steel and Iron stocks, with the exception of i
Federal Steel. American Steel and Wi: rose I
over a point. This factor helped rtie railroad*
situated in the Iron regions, notably Louisville i
and Niifchville. American Leather Company was j
marked up aevf-ral points on light transactions i
and . sth no news t. explain the rise. Inter
national Paper preferred and Consolidated Gag |
roso two points. The decline after the hank
statement was checked by good absorption, but >
thÂ° recovery was not to the top level. The j
'â loÂ«in? was quiet and firm. Bonds ere well i
held on a moderate volume of business
The course of the stock market during the ;
week has shown evidences of a weakened inter
est ami .iKth. Tlv- principal apprehension j
has bÂ«en ov>r the future of the money market. '
All accounts have agreed upon the unusual
abundance if funds at all Interior centers, hut:
the tlvit) of trade and industry Is also un- |
precedented and the enormous volume. of bank!
clearings throughout the country shows that j
more money is turned over in profitable em- i
ployment every wwk than ever before. Tho !
question has 'â â â¢--â¢â¢n whether In moving the crops, !
the usual demand wnuld be made upon Eastern !
centers for money or whether the large funds j
at interior points would prove ample. >
This question is not answered definitely yet. \
* "all money In New York has continued pretty ;
firm and it developed during the week thnt j
many stocH exchange houses were resorting to j
tune loans This, resulted In a hardening ten- j
dPncv of the time money rate and there was i
apprehension that a money squeeze in the call j

mands li-'gai'. to be made for crop moving !
purposes. Except for domestic disquiet in j
Frame the outlook 1b for easier money j
n broad, and sterling exchange at New York i
hHB shown a sharp decline toward the end of j
the week. N"w Y..rk mercantile paper has j
been reported as selling on the Chicago mar
ket The money condition in New York is
aJTfrteil by the failure of some new industrial!
6Â«curll to meet expectations. Some of these
have leclined sharply from the subscription
prices or from thÂ« prices taken as a basts for
distribution of new securities In exchange for j
those of constituent companies. Money Â»ui>- i
plied for underwriting has thus been kept liÂ»-d
up waiting to realize. Not a little of the long |
continued speculative doubt has been due to ;
the threatened Transvaal trouble, with a spe- '
flnl view to its probable effect on the gold
production if the Rand. The expected large
supply of gold from this source is a factor in â¢
the estimates of thr future world prices. The I
various causes of Inactivity, however,, have ]
tended towai amelioration during the week.
ThÂ» period of ha?ari! to the crops has come !
nearer Its end. Industrial activity continues
unabnt.-d. International trade and railroad ;
.^r:..:.'- break ill records, and the export
trade is proving itself permanently established
Bt a new high level. The strength of stocks,
which developed ftrsi In v few obscure and j
Isolated ca.ses, then In the Southwestern* and
Louisville, and Uter the grangej-s, has â * per- j
meated pretty much the whole list throughout

ASSOCIATED BANKS" STATEMENT.
:
| NEW YORK. July 29.â The New York Flnan
icier says: The statement of the New York
i Clearing-house banks for the week ending July
â  29 cannot be regarded as a favorable exhibit.
! although there iB good reason for saying that
i It does not Bhow the real condition of the banks
! at the close of business Saturday. The loss of
j nearly 14,500,000 In cash, for example, la much
more than the six days' operations called for.
The contraction of $12,705,300 in deposits reduced
reserve requirements by over $3,000,000, so that
despite the shrinkage of $4,429,300 in specie and
legals the excess declined only $1,244,47.", leav
i ing the surplus at $10,411,125. The deposit loss,
j as usual, is to be traced to a few of the more
j important Institutions, the National City Bank
alone b-ing responsible for $5,000,000 of the
, total. On the other hand the gain of nearly v
; much by the national bank, accompanied by
, a proportionate addition of specie, xtanilK In
direct contrast with the trend of the other
I banks. The liquidation In loans continues, the
. decrease of $8,334,500 in that item for the week
; making a total of more than $3Â«;000,000 in four
j weeks. In the same time deposits have de
i clined $40,000,000 and specie and leÃals Bome
thlns in exceat of $4,000,000. It .is to be noted
i that- while on July 8 the surplus reserve ws
] but $5,000,000 the clearing institutions, despite
the fact that they have $4,000,000 less cash now
; than at that time, still report $6,000,000 more
i ,of excess reserve. <Thls has been made possible
'by the liquidation ot outstanding commit-' i
! ments, but it is becoming a question how much
further the process can be continued. Loans
are now the smallest since the middle of Feb
ruary, and in the last six months the banks
ha\e" loÃt $25,0C0,000 In specie and legals. The
| continued lc*s of cash to the treasury and the
approach of the crop season, with its demands
â of the resources of this center, make the im
mediate future an interesting subject for specu- \

' CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July Apprehensions of frost,
higher cables from Liverpool and reports of
lack of moisture In India caused a firm and
'â  higher opening in wheat. September started
. i;@%c higher at 71%@71Vic. Transactions at
71'-c were extremely light and the market im
mediately sank on heavy realizing an.: sales
against calls. Before 12 o'clock September j
touched 70%@-70%C. Shipments of 1,440.000 bush- |
els, with estimated world's shipments of 6,-
SOO.OOO bushela for the week, more than offset
fears of frost in the spring wheat belt. On the j
early decline there was considerable covering
which. ' together with buying against puts, I
caused a sharp rally to 7.U4@71%c for Septem- |
ber The strength was short-lived, however,
and just before the close September again ;
touched 70% c closing with sellers at 70TÂ»'571c.
Corn ruled weak throughout on reports of !
heavy rains in the Southwest, which dlssi
! pated all fears of droiisht. Country offerings j
were large. September closed %c net lower.
A squeeze of July shorts was the feature of
the oats market. July was forced up 2%c and
closed Btrong at 26c after selling as high as >
27c. September was dull and featureless. The
July option is entirely under the control of a I
: leading local professional, who took advantage .
of the light country offerings to-day to run up I
the market on those who are presumably short
i to him. September lost %c.
; Provisions ruled dull and slightly easier on
lighi country liquidation. Packers were cred- :
! Ited with selling on a moderate scale, but the \
i trade generally appeared to he in a waiting
mood. September pork closed 7%c lower and
ribs and lard each lost 24c.

from the pump said: "At 6:30 a. m. the water
! was down 12 feet and 6 inches below the 1950-
I root level station. The elevator has been work
ing continuously."
The Best & Belcher assessment falls delin
quent in board to-morrow.

' Haggin (elected in place of Lloyd Tevls); sec
, retary, Fred Clark; vice president, F. G.

THE EMERGENCY
HOSPITALS MAY
BE ABOLISHED
Health Board Projects
Many Changes.
WILL BE DECIDED TOMORROW
DR. BABBAT AND OTHERS TO
LOSE THEIR HEADS.
Discharge of Employes Planned Be
ce.use of Auditor Wells' Action
in Holding Up This
Month's Salary.
The '.aw which compelled Auditor Wells j
to refuse to gn a number of the salary
ciaims of tho employes of the Board of
Health proves to be more far reaching
In its effect upon the employes them- |
Eolvee and upon the public welfare than \
was at first supposed. if the condition
that now presents itself to the board is
maintained by the courts when the innt
ter shall come to trial the health of San
Francisco and the many conditions that
depend vi on it will be Jeopardized.
The withholding of all salaries save
those of employes employed by the Health
Department under the provisions of the
Statutes means simply the sing of the |
two branch hospitals, the Harbor Hospital
and that at Iden Gate Park, the oblit- I
eration of the ambulance rvice in emer
gency calls, the chemical analysis of foods
Bold in the city's markets and the bacteri
ological tests necessary to the maintaln
ing- of a successful quarantine in times of
epidemic. It means also that free vacci
nation, which has be< n going on for the
past month, will be stopped, as the law
provides no salary for the vaccinating
officer or funds for his medical supplies.
These results of the enforcement of the
law are neither the fault of Auditor Wells
Hor of the Board of Health. Both offices
are compelled to rate along the lines
>aid down by statute, an statute does
liot give to the Health Department an
appropriation to be used in the payment
cf officers and mployes that the health of
*he city may most need; It merely names
certain i tions that must be filled, j
â¢whether they are needed or not. The j
Statute does not provide for any of the
Burgeons and ambulance drivers for either
Jhe Park or Harbor Hospitals, nor does
It provide for the other departments. It
allows a bare working force for the main
ioffice, and inspectors to a number in
adequate to the mitary needs of the
city. Auditor Wells hns been forced to
close the treasury to all demands save
those of the law, and the Board of Health
Js mpelled to discharge all employes
tave those provided for and abolish th
â¢positions and departments they ha\
Jilled.
A meeting to discuss ways and means
vas held at the /lealth office in the Cit
Tiall yesterday. A number of the mem
bers of the board were present, anc
though their conference was secret it be
came" known later that the board planned
tr> discharge on Monday all employes
vhnse warrants the Auditor had refuse
to sign. Some unforeseen political circum
stance may arise to change this plan, but
Â«fter the meeting yesterday this course
â¢was decided upon as the only way on
of the difficulty, and it will be broached
on Monday when the whole board meets.
"The law Is plain, before us." said a
prominent member of the board yester
day, "and we cannot and will not fight
â¢the law. Auditor Wells ha.= been com
pelled to refuse these claims and has
jiolmed out to us the statute under which
â \v> must operate. A contrary course is
â optional with neither of us. These em
jjloyes whose Balaries have been declared
illegal cannot work without pay, and the
only thing remaining for us to do Is to
Siotify them their services are dispensed
fsvith, even though it cripples th* work of
the department. The board will bring-
T.o proceedings."
Although the board will not go to law,
â¢Goorge K. MacPherson, the vaccinator,
fwill sue for writ of mandamus.
Thip decision of the board will result in
rthe abolition of the following positions

improperly or

ficient nourishment is starvation.
When a man's head aches it iÂ« because
the tissues of the brain do not receive
sufficient nourishment from the blood, or re-
reive impure and unhealthy nourishment.
When a man gets nervous and sleepless, it
mean? that the blood is not properly nour-
ishing the nerves. When his skin breaks
out with blotches arid pimples and erup-
tions, it means that the skin is being fed
upon the impurities of the blood. Almost
every known disease is primarily due to
improper nourishment through the blood,
which is the life- stream. Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery is the greatest
of all blood-makers and purifiers. It gives
edge to the appetite, corrects all disorders
of th>- digestion, makes the assimilation of
the life-giving elements of the food per-
fect, invigorates the liver, promotes secre-
tion and excretion, and vitalizes the whole
body. It makes firm, muscular flesh, but
does not make corpulent people more cor-
pulent. It cures 98 per cent, of all cases
of lingering coughs, bronchial, throat and
kindred affections, which, if neglected,
lead up to consumption. It is the best of
all nerve tonics and restoratives. Kept by
all medicine dealers.
" I was taken ill in February, 1892, with head-
ache aud pain in my back," writes H. Oaddls,
Esq., of 313 South J Street, Tacoma, Wash. "I
called in a doctor and he came three times. He
said I was bilious but I kept getting worse ; I
took a cou>;h bo that I could not sleep, only by
being propped up in bed. My lungs hurt me,
and I got so poor that I was just skin and bone.
I thought I was going to die. I used two bottles
of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and it
made me sound and well. It saved my life."
No remedy relieves constipation so
quickly and effectively as Dr. Pierces
Pleasant Pellets. They never gripe.

RIGHTS OF A JURY.
Supreme Court Favors the Freedom
of Thought and Speech.
A decision has been handed down by tlir
me Court in which it Is held that
statements of Jurors in the jury-room
after they have retired to deliberate on a
verdict arj confidential and not intended
for the ears of listening deputy sheriffs
it other people. The court reaches this
decision while ."ifTirming the judgment of
- iperior Court denying a new 'rial
in the case of Edward Saltzmai: againsi
the Sunset Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany. Saltzman brought suit against the
company to recover damnce? for personal
Injuries. The jury gave judgment against
him, and lie made a motion for a new
trial. To Bupport the motion various affi
davits of misconduct on the pnrt of jurors
were filed. Among them was one made by
the deputy sheriff having the jury in
charge In which it is> set forth that one
of the jurors said that if tht-y did not
agree on a verdict they would get no
money, and rather than face such a ca
lamity he would agTee to any verdict.
Another juror, the deputy testified, while
all were In a restaurant, rang up some
party on the telepl|pne and gave Instruc
tions regarding his personal business. In
reviewing the case the Supreme Court
held that although the telephone conver
sation should not have been allowed, tlie
conversation In the jury-room was confi
dential and could not properly be used
on a motion for a new trial, as drawing
jurors up for such acts detracts from the
freedom of thought and speech in a jury,
which is not in keeping with our Institu
tions.

RETURN OF THE
COLORED MASCOT
PRIDE OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH
REGIMENT HERE AGAIN.
Je3ss Nevrmp.n Has Been "Moving
On" at Police Direction for
Two Years and Now He
Is Tired.
The pride and mascot of the Twenty
fourth (colored) Regiment of Tennessee,
little Jesse Newman, is back in San Fran
cisco, after various adventure? by Held
and flood. He is now in pleasant durance
at the Youths' Directory, having enjoyed
the hospitality of tin- Occidental Hotel for
several days. The colored mascot! who
lias been carving a name for himself in
the history of the pending war. has had a
chequen â ! career.
Two years ago he ran away from his
father in Chattanooga, Term., and. ac
cording to bis own statement. hÂ»' lias since
then faithfully obeyed the Injunction of
the police in a hundred cities to "move
on."
"I'se done moved on till I be tired."
said the little fellow yesterday. "I left
Tennessee two year ago. when I be only
R years old, 'kase my fader whip me too
much. I made my way troo to dis city,
and den de colored regiment take ni. for
a mascot." Jesse pleaded entire igno
rance cf what mascots were, excepting
thnt he recollected that they were well
feu had pretty good times.
When the Twenty-fourth regulars left
here on the transport Sheridan Jesse went
along. Arrived at Honolulu, the colored
colonel refused to let him re-embark for
Manila. He stayed in the capital city of
Hawaii, and upon being challenged to
*how a $2<i bill and being unable to do so
he was again t"ld for the hundredth time
to "move on." and he was escorted to a
ship thnt sailed for San Francisco a few
weeks ago. On the vessel he me< Mr.
Wilder, a prominent man In the islands,
who took an imprest in the stranded n-.as
cot. When Mr Wilder reached here lie
had Jesse accompany him to the Occi
dental Hotel and kept him there for sev
eral days. Tt poes without saying thai
Jess.- was the cynosure of all eves. Mr.
Wilder'a business took him away from the
city, and the mascot was yesterday tern- !
pofarilv housed at the Youths' Directory,
where he is now aweing the peaceful boys
by recounting the deeds of derring-do
done by himself while in honorary com- j
man! of the gallant Twenty-fourth.
In his two years of wandering he has;
never paid a conductor fare. He haa vis-
Ited the principal American cities, and
has had as good a time as if the Mayors
thereof had offered him the keys of their
citk-s. !
N< W he iias tired of war and is wearied
of the police injunction to "move on." He \
is waiting for Mr. AYilder to return to the
city and tnl<e him hack to Honolulu,
where he ran live in one place, free of the :
savagery of war. the small feed of trans- '
ports and the dreaded injunction of the
( onstabularj â 
Coroner's Inquests.
Tl]f> rl^ath of Mrs. Maria Parente was
taken up by a Cnrnner's jury jresterday
morning. The testimony of Autopsy Sur- '
pr.<n Zabala was that the woman had j
riird of septic perotinltis following the un- ;
lawful use of lime?. Thp other witnesses j
fcave testimony tending to provo that the I
woman was t lie cause of her own death. |
The jury returned a verdict that the de- !
ceased < : ;mir> to hrr doatli at the hands of,
parties unknown.
In the oasfe of All <ium. the Chinese,
woman found murdered in a room at Sfin
Stockton street on tlie 2.".th of this month,
the verdict w;ts murder by unknown par- '
ties.
Mrs. Phallwatz's House Ransacked.
Mrs. Pliallwatz of fi2T T'nion street re
ported at the California-street police sta
tion yesterday afternoon that on the pre
vious night her house had been entered
by burglars, who stole a silk dress valued

THREE JURORS SAY
SHE IS INNOCENT
MINNIE ADAMS' FATE NOT
YET DECIDED.
Judge Lawlor Orders the Sheriff to
Keep the Twelve Good Men and
True in His Keeping.
The jury which must determine the fate
of Mrs. Minnie Adams, charged wiih the
murder of her Infant son. John Richard
Cray, spent last night in confinement un
der the eyes of several Deputy Sheriffs.
When the case was called yesterday
morning .Judge Lawlor instructed the
.fury. His instructions, while not drae
ging along the hours as did those in the
celebrated Durrant case, exhaustively
covered the law of circumstantial evi
dence, ns well as other matters neces
sary for the enlichtf-nment of the jury.
The instruction of the jury completed,
.ludpe Lawler ordered the jury into the
keeping of the Sheriff, that a verdict
intent he deliberated upon. Last evening
at 6 o'clock a verdict had not been
reached and Judgre I.awlor <*rdered the
jury locked up for the night It was un
derstood when the order was made that
nine were joined for conviction, while
thn-e held out for acquittal.
Scorned Parental Objection.
Walter F. Plunkett, the 18-year-old son
of William A. Plnnkett, the well-known
attorney, and Miss Tfia Marsh, daughter
of a local mining operator, wore marrWl
last Saturday in Pan Rafael by the Rev.
Father Philippe. The wedding was secret.
It is= ?nld, because the young couple were
afraid of parental objection. Young Plun
kett and his bride were schoolmates in
the Horace Mann (Jrammar School a few
years ago, and It was there that their
friendship began which culminated in
their marriage. They will leave in a few
days for Fairfax, where they will spend
their honeymoon.

I was ab< â¢ J -. tp sailing out through the
Golden Gate and the happiest boy in the

to our trip th and set

enterprise. The officers were kind, the

Then I i' 1 called all hands and

of course If some of those eeals fall dead

there were plei I s, so we â¢ I

merrily on. We laughed and sung and
scoffed at thi . clumsy Russians
frozen in at Vladivostok.
On July 4 we saw smoke to the north

a man-of-war, and the captain decided
it was a whaler, so we went to work again
with a will and 1 ibout Russia or

Fight, so I f. It in-.:.- than happy. I was
large for my age and could do a man's

as by the sailors.
At 4 p. m. "ii the Fourth, a heaw fog
came upâ so thick thai you couldn't see
your band in front of your face. Ed
Larkin. Walter Pebbler and I were still
on the island busily at work and had
not noticed the fog until it was all around
us. Then we made a rush for the
and started to pull for the schooner,
which was lying off the island about a
mile and a half. Well, the fog settled in
so fast that we lost track of the ship
and had to turn about and spend the
night on the island. Mighty glad we were
to get back, too, for we had no compass
nor provisions, and the fog had become
so dense that we nearly missed the lal
sind< as well as being unable to locate the
schooner. At 8 o'clock the next morning
it cleared and there right alongside of

t-war as one could wish to
We knew at a glance that it was
all up. and in our blind terror tried to

were strewn around by the thousands
the rocky Island.
The Russians, however, sighted our
ach. It was probably just
as well for us, for if we had been left
on that rockbound spot we should have
died of exposure and starvation. They
picked us up, took us aboard ship and
put us In irons with the rest of the crew.
Six days later we were in Vladivostok
Ing hustled through the formality
of a trial for our "enormous offense
against his Majesty the Czar." We were
all convicted ami sentenced to twenty
years' Imprisonment in that place of liv
ing deathâ the Saghalien Prison, where
we were at once taken.
The sickening horrors of that hole I
never shall forget. I still bear the marks
of the knout and will take to my grave
the frightful physical ailments contracted
in the slimy dungeon of Saghalien. I went
in a hearty sailor ladâ strong and able
physical]:- and mentally. I came out a
wreck. At the time of imprisonment I
weighed 113 pounds; when released from
underground confinement I tipped the
scales .-it barely 62.
For three years â each one of which
seemed a lifetimeâ we were kept in a
rock cave about fifty feet square far be
low the surface. In fact, this hole had
been hi llowed out so deep into the jowels
of the rocky island of Saghalien that the
fl, 01 of our room was under tide level
and the water had to be pumped out
oiicc a week from a corner ni.idi deeper
foi thai purpose.
Three years we were kept in this hell
hole and saw th< light of day but three
times in all that period. The only break
in the horrible monotony was when we
were taken into an upper room to be
flogged like dogs and thrown into the
"sweat box.' The sweat box is the most
hly Ingenious torture device ever
Invented this side of purgatory. It is a
cell kept black as midnight, and all
around *>re fti-am pipes and a small jet
of escaping steam. They flog an offender
until the blood streams down his back
and then threw him into this place. The
salty perspiration gets into the cuts. Tne
enervating, fetid air stifles and weakens
the victim and the intense darkness is
maddening.
How we ever lived and kept our minds
during those terrible years is to me a
mystery- Our food consisted of black
bread and once a month a little walrus or
eeal meat; never 'any vegetables. When
dangerously i'l we would be taken to an
upper hospital for a few days and given
cond-infKd milk and hot water.
Guards watched us night and day, and
whenever more than two would group
themselves together for a chat they would
separate us with oaths, blows and kicks.
Every morning some of the Russian pris
oners from the upper worldâ a class o'i
trusties â would come down to clean out
the place and Incidentally kick and cuff
about any of us poor devils that would
get in the way.
One morning a great strapping Russian
came about this work and passed where
our captain was sitting in the corner, his
head on his knees. The captain had been
blue for several days and had not spoken
a word to any of us. lie and the first
mate were always kept under the special
watch of the hawk-eyed guard, anyway,
they being the two men the captain of the
prison seemed to fear the most. Well,
this great brute of a trusty leaned for
ward as he passed the captain, and with
an ugly chuckle deliberately slapped the
unoffending man on the face. For an in
stant there was a d< adly quietâ Just a sec
ondâbut it seemed a lifetime. It was
as though every <>ne had felt that blow on
his own face. The look on Captain Mc-
Gregor's face as he realized the Insult 1
shall never forget and hope never to see
again; it meant death. He leaped to his
feet and was on that man like a wildcat.
The weight of his body landed fair and
full on the big Russian's chest and his
fingers gripped his throat like a vise. The
big mar. fell like an ox, striking his head
with fearful force on the stone floor.
A hoarse, animnl-like cry went up from
the crowd, and then came the clear ring
ing voice of the mate, shouting:
"Avast there and at the devils!"
And at them we went, hammer and
tongs.
Oh, that was a royal fight! It was well
worth the suffering it brought us all, for
we drubbed. those trusties within an Inch
of their li\ â¢
At the first yell the guards had been re
inforced, so we didn't last long, but wero
soon clubbed into submission.
The captain of the prison came down
and gave us a talk in very bad English,
but straight enough to the point. He said
lie didn't mind our half killing the Rus
sian convicts so much, but he must main
tain discipline, so he ordered us all out for
general flogging.
Captain McGregor had nearly killed his
man. The fellow's face was so battered
that his own mothor would not have
known him. He never came near our
place again. He had learned his lesson.
Well, we caught it heavy that day. They
took the captain first, strapped him down
and flogged him before our eyes until the
blood streamed from his poor seamed
back, and he fainted away. Then they
revived him and repeated the brutal
whipping.
The rest of us got our share, but not
such a cruel dose. They put the captain
In the Bweatbox and kept him there for
fifty-two hours. He was brought back
to us unconscious, and when he finally

came to he was out of his head and raved
for three days.
After that we had no more trouble witn
the trusties, but the bad food and foul
air began to tell and the moat horrible
diseases broke out among us. We be
came weaker and weaker and all went
through terrible stages of delirium and
bodily suffering. The dreadful scenes of
those days are better passed without de

repetition.

A Bicycle Boat
for the English
Channel
LONDON, July 12.â The channel sticks j
in England's throat. It is so exasperating
to have a sheet of water stretching out
before you so rough that you dare not j
breast it except upon a big steamer or the ;
most reliable yacht.
English sportsmen are always experi- j
r.u nting with channel boats, and each
year they believe they have found some- ;
The latest channel invention in not desj
to work great transformations in
the mi thods of channel travel, nor to great
â¢ â ; commerce. It is in truth only
a new bil of sporting life let into the pres- ,
â¢ ir i he water.
A Folkestone Inventor has rigged up a ,
cycle boat, upon which he, declares it will
be possible to cross the channel in ten
"hours. A day's trip of easy working on;
the water will bring you from Dover,]
which is only a short distance north of
Folkestone, to Calais. The boat, which.
looks uncommonly like a row boat, can be ;
worked like a tandem, making the weight
which the operator must push much less.
The movement is exactly similar to the
pedal movement of a bicycle, each down
ward push causing the pa'ldle wheel to -
. and propelling the boat forward.
The rapidity of the boat depends upon
trength and rapidity of the push;
and iliis depends upon practice and thÂ«
muscles of a man's legs.
Tandem bicycling across the English
channel should be great fun. It has been
tried by Chicol up the Rhine with much;
success, but unfortunately every attempt;
in send the bicycle boat across the chan- i
nel lias been unsuccessful. Just off
Folkestone, on the first attempt, a storm
came up and drenched the riders so that i
they put back to port for personal re
pairs. The b< cond trip resulted in a chain
breaking, quite a bicycllstic experience;
and the third, which should have been
sful, was brought to a sudden end
by the Indisposition of one of the pas
sengers, for the boat carries two persons
besides the wheelmen.
There may .soon be a motor boat op
erated like the automobile cabs. But that
is some way off. The electric launches
are propelled on a different and more
expensive principle.
This bicycle boat is quitÂ© inexpensive,
its $300 for the machinery, and in
addition to this the cost of the rowboat,
which may run from $50 up to $F>oo, accord
ing to the woods. The Folkestone boat ,
$350.
The idea is an advance one for Henley
next year. If the boat can be operated ;
successfully, and if other boats can be i
built and the Get man boat can be induced
to com. to Henley, then there can be a
new exhibition of aquatic sport at this j
famous water course.
The motion is one that could be lml
-1 tated by any machinist, who will readily
see by what simple art the wheels of'the
; paddle can be made to go around in obedl
! ence to the pushing down of the pedals
thai connect with the paddles. The j
strength required Is. upon smooth water, |
about equal to that required for pushing |
a tandem up a very slight incline. It does j
not run of Itself, likea tandem upon a per
level plane, but it requires only the |
slightest push. As for the sport, it is ;

*S is certainly a unique undertaking.
For years the press of the United
States has been printing letters that pur
ported to describe things as they were on
these islands, but I have found that much
of the matter has emanated from the
pens of subsidized correspondents or from
writers who reli I much upon their
imagination for their farts.
That Hawaii is beautiful no one can
deny. That these islands are among the
choicest of our new possessions there can
be no question, but that they constitute
an earthly paradise for a man out of a
Job is a statement that is not true to
fact. For some time the opinion has pre
vailed that all one had to do was to go
to Hawaii and that wealth would follow
as a necessity. On the contrary. Hawaii
is the very last of all our colonial ;
eions to which I should advise a man to
go unless he has sufficient capital to make
him Independent of circumstances for a
long time, as well as enough surplus to
allow him to take advantage of his op
portunity when it presents it-
First, it must be r^n^ mbered that Ha

a city before San Francisco was estab

are no such opportunities here. The pop

they would be from similar investments

Yellow Jack.
WHEN yellow fever Is wiped out
of Cuba, especially out of Ha
vana and Santiago, it will be
wiped out of the United States.
Yellow fever does not originate
in this country- Every epidemic which
the Southern States have known has been
started by the importation of cruses frcm
Cuba. These epidemics have cost more
than a thousand lives a year for many
years, and often ten times that number
during one single visitation. The money
expenditure which has been necessary to
keep up national quarantines and tne
commercial loss which has resulted from
State quarantines have amounted up in
the scores of millions.
This indicates the immense importance
of the work which is now being done by
our American military officers in Cubn
toward the wiping out of the disease.
Yellow fever has existed in Santiago
do Cuba under the misnomer of "per
nicious malaria" since the surrender of
the city last July. Americansâ soldiers
and civiliansâ have died of it. cases have
filled the fever hospital across the bay
from Santiago, and other cases a plenty
have been sent home convalescent to re
cuperate In the more -healthful climate of
the United States.
In Santiago nowadays the term "per
nicious malaria" is a byword. It 1b now
known there that fully 60 per cent of

vines.
In the Hawaiian Islands one may select
the kind of climate that is best suited to
him and know no other. He may select
a spot that is sufficiently cool while yet
frosts are unknown and chilling winds
blow not; he may select another spot
where the heat is excessive, or he may
ascend from the sea to the mountain-tops
and feel the air growing cooler with al
most every step. In fact, as one scientist
has remarked, "every graduation of tun
perature, altitude and humidity, with
varying forces and volume of wind eur
rents. Is presented In the Hawaiian
Islands. Moreover, each grove, beach,
vale, summit and belt of land preserves
its respective climatic attributes almost
unchanged throughout the year. It is
this latter fact that has made these
islands the ideal spot for invalids. A
certain climate may be selected and there,
one may remain without fear of change,
or by traveling about from place to place
one may follow what Is something like
ter months of IS9B were really victims of
the dread yellow scourge in a more or
less mild form. The fact that their hos
pital papers bore the words "pernicious
malaria" did not serve to lessen the peril
of the patients, but it prevented the
danger of a panic and helped materially
in the reconstruction and purification of
the city.
And that was why General Leonard
Wood, military and civil Governor of San
tiago de Cuba, knowingly and with pre
medltatlon, successfully concealed the
fact that yellow fever existed within the
confines of the province.
That General Wood fully anticipated the
present outbreak is beyond question. He
knew that fever would return In force
this summer despite all that medical skill
and sanitary precautions could do to pre
vent it.
"It is as impossible to carry American
troops and civilians through the hot trop
ic.il months of June. July and August
without a number of fatalities from yel
low fever as it would be to stop a Mauser
bullet without being hurt," he said.
"I say it is impossible to entirely es
cape." he added, "but, please God, we
will do everything in the power of man
to reduce the casualties as much as pos
sible. If we succeed in cutting the regu
lar annual record of deaths one-half, or
even one-fourth. I shall be satisfied." â 
That everything "in the power of man"
had been done to keep tke scourge from
the rotation of the seasons In the tem
perate latitudes."
Politically Hawaii is about as peaceful
a place as one could wish to see. The
whites and many of the better class of
natfves are well satisfied to accept the
protection of Uncle Sam. As to the na
tive proper as he la seen in the common
walks of life, he has no opinions at all
upon the .subject. Of course there are
Hopes to Save Thousands
of Laves by Stamping
Out the Frightful
Cuban Scourge.
Santiago since General Wood assumed
charge is a matter of common fame.
There are some men who might have felt
discouraged when confronted with the
task that faced General Wood last July.
It only spurred him on.
"It is yellow fever we must fight,
Hanna," he said to his aid as the two
took their first ride through the city.
"We have a foe here which is going to
give us a life and death struggle. He
is there In that heap of refuse, and in
that adobe shanty over there, and here
beneath our feet. We must fight him
with brooms and shovels, with soap and
water, and with new rules that will turn
this town upside down."
One of the first precautions taken by
the nervy, cool-headed American was to
decry the fact that yellow fever exleted
in Santiago. Experience with human na
ture told him that the widespread pub-,
licatlon of the fact would serve no good
cause, but that it would possibly create
a panic, cause demoralization and prac
tically put a check upon his plans for re
deeming the city from its centuries of
filth. Good work cannot be expected from
men who feel that they are walking cheek
by jowl with Yellow Jack.
His second precautionâ seemingly a
paradoxâ was the conversion of a small
island in Santiago Bay into a hospital for
the treatment of contagious fevers. Build
ings completely equipped with medical
facilities were erected and everything
provided for the very visitation now oc
curring in the city.
Shortly after the hospital was In readi
ness so many cases were sent there that
attention was attracted to it. One Ameri
can connected with the Postofflco went to
the palace in alarm one day. General
Wood smiled grimly when the man stated
his errand.
"Yellow fever?" he exclaimed. "Non
sense! The reports say pernicious ma
laria, and I guess the doctor knows what
he Is talking about."
Each day the one paper th^n being pub
lished In Santiago recorded the death of
from two to ten citizens or BOlfliers from
pernicious malaria. These reports excited
little or no comment. There was a fa
miliar ring to the word' "malaria," at least
to the Americans, and if they wondered at
all it was that "chills and fever" could
carry off so many.
One day the man In charge of the Mer
ritt & Chapman wrecking operations on
the Spanish warships strolled into the
office of the company's agent, Julian Cen
cioya.
"I am not feeling very well." he said,
dully. "I guess it must be the heat."
Before Cendoya could reply his visitor
lurched heavily against a desk. The next
moment he was prone on the door. The
agent knew from certain symptoms just
what was the matter, and he hastily sum
moned a native doctor living in the neigh
borhood. An hour later the stricken man
was resting in a boarding-house back of
the cathedral. Then the doctor, according
to the rules, made his report at the palace.
"It is pernicious malaria, senor," he said
to General Woou. "The patient has all the
still natives In high positions who are
thorough royalists at heart, but even they
are willing to accept things as they are.
The common native, however, harbors no
resentment at what anti-annexationists
have pleased to term his "downfall. At
the same time he does not feel any senti
ment of gratitude at being relieved from
the bondage of fi monarchy. The simple
fact is that political feelings of any kind

"Have that man removed to the island
within an hour or I will put you In the
cablldo," interrupted the general sternly.
"And rememberâ lt Is malaria, do you un
derstand?"
When the man left the hospital con
valescent several weeks later he carried m
certificate wrung from the surgeon bear
ing the significant words, "Discharged

In October General "Wood dranr vcp an
elaborate plan to be followed when thÂ«
anticipated return of the fever In epi
demic form occurred. It was now that
his training aa a physician proved invaju
able.
He understood the disease hx all it*
phases and he knew just what precau
tions were rational and efficient. There
â¢were three principal points as outlined.
These were, first, the Immediate . break
ing up of the various regiments Into
small squads and their being kept con
stantly on the move from camp to camp
outside the city; second, the absolute
maintenance of sobriety among all Ameri
cans; third, the establishment of a rigid
quarantine.
"I look upon rum or any alcoholic bev
erage as the greatest factor In the con
traction of yellow fever," hÂ© said In ex
plaining his plan. "Heating the Mood
with bad whisky Is simply creating a hod
bed for the propagation of the germs.
A man cannot drink and face the fever
unscathed."
It is this rule that General "Wood it

excessive quantities, but that method of
treatment has been abandoned.
In preparing for a summer season of
yellow fever in Santiago the possible valuo
"of using immune troops was taken into
careful consideration. A decision in the
negative was reached, the immunity of
soldiers previously exposed to contagious
fevera being very much open to doubt.

owned that ever sirce she had been a girl .
she had dreaded being caught by her last
leg, lust as she was getting Into bed, ny s
some one concealed under It. She said
when she was younger and more active*
she used to take a flying leap from a
distance and bo bring both her legs up
saf< into bed at once, but that this nat]
always annoyed Deborah, who pkiued
herself on setting Into bed gracefully, anu
she nad given it up in consequence^ But
now the old terror would often come
over her. nnd as it was Â£o very v unpleas
ant to think of looking under a bed and
seeing a man concealed, with a great.
fierce face staring out at you, sne had
bought a penny ball, and now she rolled â 
this ball under the bed every night. If it
came out on the other side, well ana
good; if not. she always took care to
have her hand on the bell rope, and meant
to call out 'John' and 'Harry'â just as if
she expected men servants to answer her
I suppose we are all. of us more or less
nervous, and it is singular to note what
strange outlets some women's nervous
ness chooses.
There is the woman who goes to the
play and during the performance con
stantly sniffs and peers around In an ap
prehensive way. We all know that "fire"
Is in her thoughts, and are made accord
ingly unc< mfortable.
Then there is the calamitous creature,*
who is always foreboding some impend-
Ing disaster because she "feels- it in her
bones," and the woman who "doesn't be
lieve in ghosts," who burns the gas and
sits up In bed half th? nlt?ht and Keops
everybody else awake, so as to be ready
to run away from j them if they should
happen to put In an appearance, andâ but,
dear me, the list Is too long to enumerate.
Let me tell you thisâ my lady of nerves
ran never charm by her beauty. To. sit
in her presence and endure her fidgets
and not know what demon of unrest pos
eessea her i Bsinfply maddening.
A state of nervousness will sometimes
bring forth a heart-wringing crop of
facial eruptions: It will dry the skin and
make it sallow, take the vitality out of
th< hair and derange the internal organs
to the-utter detriment of beauty.
Those knowing gentlemen of pilla ana
pellets tell us that v.hen there is a defect
in the structure, of the nervous system
it is " usually because some certain re
gion of cells is not well flushed with
blood. The remedy, they say. lies In dis
cipline and training, nourishing food ex
ercise and plenty of sleep and good fresh
English physicians claim that many of
the nervous diseases to which American
women are victims are due to what they
term the "rocking-chair habit." They say
that the amount of nervous energy ex
.pended in useless and injurious rocking
is Incredible, and that a woman who im
agines herself to be resting will exercise
as much force of the lower muscles of the
back as would suffice to run a sewing ma
chine for the same length of time.
All I can say in support of this theory
is that the health of middle-class English
women, among whom rockers are rare, is
generally superior to that of our own.
The finest recipe in the world for nerv
ousness Is to laugh at everything, espe
but iike Martha of Md, you are careful
and troubled about many things.
MISS HOPE LA CHAPELL, Stockton-
It is difficult for you to place your affec
tions as you are hard to please. Your love
affairs will always be more or less dis
appointing. You dislike to assume re
sponsibilities and would find domestics life
burdensome. ...
MISS FAY BELMONT- This person will
experience many changes in life, but will
always have plenty of friends and will
marry twice. You allow the emotions to
rule father too much. You will travel ex
tensively and make a home in several dif
ferent places.
LADY MAUDE, Stocktonâ You will
make a change in location which will be
of decided advantage to you. You have
plenty of enterprise and ambition and a
talent for mimicry, and would succeed in
dramatic work. You have a very artistic
f MISâ¢ LILLIAN RUSSELL, Stocktonâ
You have never had health that you could
depend upon and have had two severe 1 11 â
nesses in the past. You have a nature
greatly dependent upon loving attentions.
The early part of your life shows several
severe disappointments, but the future
looks bright.
N P Fresnoâ You will never allow sen
timent 'to interfere with sense. Your head
will always rule your emotions. Your
lines clo not sHow a very strong constitu
tion, but with your intense ambition you
will overcome all obstacles. Your nature
Is quite Puritanical.
MISS CAB G. V.â Your nature Is force
ful. You are inclined to want your own
way under all circumstances. Do not
allow yourself to worry over your dis
appointments. There are pood financial
prospects for you between 40 and 80.

and wisely has she chosen it. for nowhere

Answers to Correspondents
MISS SANDERSâ Some one did once. I
believe, figure out the Ideal proportions
of a woman as to waist measurement,
length of neck, height; etc.. but I do- not
happen to have these measurements at
hand, so am unable to give them to you.
Am sorry. Hope n^xt time you come I
will be able to give you a more sats

MARlEâ Following Is the formula for
the orange flower skin food. Spermaceti,
one-half ounce; white wax, one-half
ounce; lanolin, one ounce; cocoanut oil,
one ounce; oil of r.weet almonds, two
ounces; orange flower water, one ounce;
simple tincture of benzoin, â  ten drops.
Melt the first live ingredients in a porce
lain kettle. When thoroughly incorpo
rated remove from the fire- and add the.
benzoin and the orange water. Then beat
briskly with an egg-beater until fluffy and
beginning to harden. â¢ There is nothing
poisonous or inflammable about It. What
a very funny question! As though I would
suggest anything for the skin that was
either one of these two things. Be sure
and use a porcelain kettle in preparing
the food, as tin is Injurious to the oils.
Rub It into the skin at bed time, after the
face has been washed with tepid water
and castlle soap. Doubtless the little
eruptions that cause you so much unhap
plness are the result of some derange
ment of the digestive apparatus. Watch
your diet carefully. Also follow the gen
eral rules of hygiene so frequently laid
â¢out in this department. You will find Us
en reful and methodical. You are. very
Bensttive and easily hurt when no injury
is intended. Your life in the early part
shows poor health and trying conditions.
You will travel later in life.
EDD M., Missionâ You are a good
hearted eapy-going individual, but so far
lacking 'in will power to carry out plans
frequently made. You are practical ajid
clear-headed, but a trifle too impulsive for
your own good. There are better financial
prospects ahead for you.
ZA CHARY TAYLORâ You are a cau
tious, conservative person, one who could
not br influenced readily by those about
you unless thuir methods appealed to your
judgment. Plenty of quiet determination
is shown here and much firmness.
MRS. PRINCEâ Your hand .indicates a
nervous susceptible nature, interested In
anything occult or mysterious. You have
married a man of phlegmatic tempera
ment, who is, however, very fond of you.
VINCENT MARTINâ This hand shows
an impressible nature. You are fond of
the opposite sex and yet fastidious in the
selection of an object upon whom to lavish
your affection. You are sensible and emo
tional. . .... :^
MISS RUTH R â Your hand shows love
of ease and luxury and a fondness for all
the good things of this world, without a
corresponding desire to make the neces
sary effort to secure them. You are rather
willful and inclined to the material rather
than to the spiritual. â¢
MISS M. E.. Sacramento â You allow peo
ple to impose upon you through your af
fections and do not receive as much as
you lavish upon others. Do not allow
your heart to govern you so completely.
You will marry once.
MISS DAISY GONEâ Tou will marry
happily, but a man with small means. In

EDITH M.â l cannot give you the nainÂ«
of a prepared face powder through the

home-made powder here Is the formula for
one that is delightful: One ounce Lu

horncie acid,, two drops attar of rose.
Have your druggist powder each ingre
dient separately in a mortar. Put your
rice powder through a fine s'eve and then
through bolting cloth. Do the same with
the oxide of zinc, magnesia and boracic
acid before adding them to the rice pow

GRACIE A.â Here is the recipe for the

ounce; white wax. one-half ounoe; sweet
almond oil, two and one-half ounces;

THELMA B.Â«-Have answered your. first
question by mail. l really do "not know
of any way of reducing large knuckles
except by constantly pressing them. The
cucumber milk will improve the .yellow
skin. Cream will not cause superfluous
hair to grow. I have never before heard
the theory about mashed grapes, so can
not give an opinion on the subject. The
drier and fluffier the hair the more In
clined it is to curl, so that any oil rubbed
constantly- into the scalp Is very apt to
make the hair less. curly. The astringent
wash is made by placing in a half-pint
bottle one ounce of cucumber Juice, three
ounces of elder flower water and one
ounce of eau de cologne. Then shake- the
mixture weir and add very slowly one
half ounce of simple tincture of benzoin,
shaking now and then. Then fill the bot-

W. S. S. . Fresnoâ You arc a person to
go to extremes In all you do. You like
to investigate every new system; are
broad-minded and courageous; easily an
gered but quickly over it, and are gen
erous In all your thoughts. You will make
money early In life and will marry once.
IDA McF., San Joseâ This is the hand
of wasted opportunities, but there are
many happy possibilities Jn your future.
Ycu will marry a man of small means
at 20.
GEORGE NAFH. Napaâ Your life has
been a serious disappointment owing to
your pSins having bexn thwarted in years
past. You must beware of liquor and try
to malse the best of yourself. Life holds
much for you still. ,
HELEN HANKS. Oaklandâ You are too
easily influenced, and you allow your emo
tions to rule your life. Exercise more self
denial and you will be happier.
FANNIE L.. Sonomaâ You have had
two unhappy love affairs and in conse
quence arc cynical and cold-hearted.
CHeto up; there is better success for you
later on.
T. M. C, Hayes streetâ Ypu will have
a long and prosperous life, with few dis
appointments. Your married If fo has been
a happy one and will continue so.
N. C. GILBERTâ This is the hand of a
man" engaged in mechanical work. You
would make a good civil engineer. You
will ir.arrv twice and be the father of
three children.
ROSE BAXTERâ This palm indicates
a restless, irritable nature, inclined to be

MRS. ROSEâ I do not happen to have a

Powdered castile soap, one ounce; pow
dered borax, one ounce: alcohol, one
ouncef yolk of an <*g. well beaten; warm
water one pint. Put this in a bottle and
cork it tightly. Shake the bottle until you
have a fine lather. If carefully corked
after using it will keep in a cool place for
a long time. There are so many things .
more agreeable to use on the hair than
rastor Oil. The following tonic, for in
stance: Four ounces eau de cologne, one
half ounce tincture of cantharides and
one-fourth dram each of oil of lavender
and oil of rosemary. Apply to the roots
once or twice a day, using a small sponge
for the purpose.

fordandruff and is also excellent for hair
that insists upon amputating itself from
the scalp: Forty-er-ht Brains resorcln.
one-fourth ounce glycerine and enough al

every night, rubbing it well into the scalp, ,
While using this tonic the hair should be

Miss Roberts Discusses
"A Girl of Grit."
To begin with the title appeals to me.
In our profession such a qualification is
Indispensable, and its cultivation in all
walks of life should be encouraged, even
through the medium of a somewhat yel
low detective story. One character in the
tale is made to say, "Vast wealth is a
terrible burdenâ to usÂ« it aright a grave
responsibility, especially so when it has
come undeserved." I would Â«;ay the same

No past misdeeds could have been seri

one's very nose. I don't believe the
authors themselves think any too well of
such productions, but perhaps they are
none too pleased to find others sharing
their opinions. When a man in a com
mercial spirit writes down to a certain
element he must not expect to be written
up by those out of his selected Eden.

Margaret Anglin's Re-
view of "The Wolf's
Long Howl."
One night in my dressing-room I took
up the very attractive looking volume left
here for me, or rather for my opinion.
If I were to read with a view to criticism
I should never read at all, for ncr one
knows so well as my own poor pen how
thoroughly Incompetent It is to pass judg
ment on the work of any other pen. The
pleasure of reading good books from
cover to cover is a luxury granted to
those with time to command, yid so, not
knowing what choice to make from the
collection of stories in "The Wolf's Long
Howl," my hatpin was called upon to do
the duty of selection, and it slipped in be
tween the Dages of "The Man Who Fell
in Love." The title promised trouble, and
tho tale fulfilled tbÂ« promise. Tho hero
of her carriage when she rides about in
splendor, may make or mar careers by
the batting of an eye. The Queen looks
at you â that settles it â you are worth
looking at. All England gets out its
lorgnettes. Clara Butt, It seems, was a
pupil at the Royal Academy, who had
never attracted any particular atten
tion until one day the Duke of Cm
naught, the Queen's second son. took a
notion to visit the academy. Miss Butt
sang and his Royal Highness deigned
to be pleased. Ho returned home and
communicated his pleasure to her Mi : ; t
Gracious Majesty, who graciously con
descended to have the young lady sent
for. Well, she sang before the Queen.
It appeared in the court circular that
her Majesty had deigned to listen to a
young person from the academy, and
Clara Butt's fortune was made. Now
she bellows forth "Ben Bolt" with a
very little more art than the un-Sven
galied Trilby and society bursts its
gloves in applause.
The English Bentlment for the royal
family is" a revelation and a surprise
to me. I cannot get ustd to it. So
thoroughly saturated am I in Ameri
canism that royalty has always seemed
to me something of a joke, a little rem
nant of fairy tale days that nobody
took quite seriously. It is very slowly

her a new bonnet, for "Vanity :s part of
love, if love is test of vanity." When
stories are given titles that lead you to
expect what you don't get and are yet
consistent with the tnle. the author may
safely be called original, and pleasantly
so when, as in the case in question, the
surprise is not disappointing. "The Wolfs
Long Howl" suggests forests and fron
tiers and melancholy isolation and the
need all flocks have for care and shelter.
If my hatpin had chosen less wisely it
might have prevented your finding out,
happily for yourselves, the reason for the
author's choice of subiect. Hatpins are
not given hends for nothing!

EdWinStevens on "Tam
ing of the Jungle."
When Dr. Doyle fled to India to
escape the ghost of Sherlock Holmes
he did well. In introducing us to
his delightful Rain Deen in "The
Taming of the Jungle" he places us
under such deep obligations that we feel
the amende honorable has been made and
find it in our hearts to forgive him for
Holmes' untimely demise. To one un
familiar with Hindoostanese, the opening
chapters of the new work do not give
promise of the delights to follow. Once
having absorbed, so to speak, a glossary,
the interest never flags, and Rain Deen
is admitted to your literary holy of holies.
Trie very simplicity and unpretentious
ness of the book disarm you, and by a
subtle something in the style the jungle
Is placed before you, and as you lay the
screed down with a sigh of regret you
can almost hear the "Lobhan there Kood
ruth!" andâ well, you feel better for hav
ing known Rain Deen and his- associates.
The one jarring note in- the book is the
chapter where the atithor injects himself
into the story. You have become so

dawning npon me that here the divine
right of kings is a solemn dogmaof faith
and that our doctrine that all men are
created equal is the most sinful species
of heresy. Think of it, the Declaration
of Independence a sin! It is mightily
like declaring the Ten Commandments
all off! Of course one finds occasional
English subjects who criticize the royal
family and advocate social equality in
true republican fashion, but they. I
believe, are not the representative Eng
lish people.
They belong as a rule to a younger,
more progressive generation; to newer
families who have no lineage to boast
of. Amonsr the genuine old British
stock there is but one name more sacred
that "Queen." God and Queen are
breathed with almost equal fervor. A
few days ago I spent the afternoon with
one of these loyal old familiies. iv this
case old in more than one particular.
It consists of four maiden ladies, the
youngest 52, all living in an ancestral
mansion under the protection of their
father, who is S6 years of age. The ex
perience was like a chapter from an
old English novel, although I as an
American felt incongruously new. The
ladies occupied themselves with em
broidery and wo gossiped over the tea
cups quite like Jane Austen's heroines. .
The cups, by the way, were 150 years
old: the spoons were ?M, and so was th<!
clock that ticked on the huge old man

"Have you ever made a collection of

was put to me in the course of the
conversation.
"No; I haven't. How do you begin

"Why, simply take tho crests from

hal'it of saving them from all your cor

I stated as delicately as I could that

probably not make a very enormous

Tho entrance of the old gentleman in
terrupted our inspection of the crest
collection. Although white and totter

could not have been surpassed by the
veriest ' Prince Charming. "I am de

graceful of bows. As it was the first

Points on "Nigel Fer

"Nigel Ferrard" is a fairly interesting
book of no great literary merit. The
story is badly constructed and lacks de
tail to make the plot plausible. Some
of the characters are clear-cut and well
drawn and the moral balance is good,
but it is too full of unnecessary argu
ments and platitudes, which, while they
may be of interest, are incongruous in
this book and seem to have been put in
for the purpose of stringing out a thin
plot In a few instances there is a ten
derness passionateness and intensity
which are refreshing and interesting, even
beautiful, but these passages are so -wal
lowed up by the painful effort of the au
thoress to create a morbid and unnatural
atmosphere and the general sensational
and -commonplace style that they are in

"A Little Legacy" is a collection of
short stories presenting phases of English
life and carrying us from London and her
environs to. the beautiful out-of-town
houses of British wealth and hospitality.
Short stories are a wise provision for the
busy, and when weil told, as they are in

best, telling the story of an ingenuously
happy young girl who takes her pleasures

"I suppose over there in America you
don't know the meaning of the word
loyalty." he said, with a smile that was
a trifle Ironical.
"Oh, yes, we do; but not that kind of
loyalty. We are all kings and queens
In America," I said, perhaps a little
flippantly.
Had I declared myself one of the most
blessed Trinity I don't think the old
gentleman could have been morÂ©
shocked. From his point of view I had
been guilty of absolute sacrilege. I had
Jested with the sacred name of Queen.
He struggled with himself for several
minutes, then made his excuses and
went to walk in the garden. "I hope I
haven't offended your father," I said
to one of the daughters. "You know
royalty is entirely new to me, and I
haven't learned how to consider It."
"Oh, you mustn't mind father," shÂ»
said apologetically. '"You see, he is
very old, and you happened to strike
his particular hobby. He is a royalist
to the core, and considers it wicked to
maintain that all men are equal. But
you mustn't mind him," she Insisted.
"We understand that it is only the
fault of your education that you think
such things."
The "fault" of my education was not
as comforting as she intended it to be.
However, I let it pass. "And how do
you feel about it?" I said, with Increas
ing interest. "Do you believe that God
intended men to be. divided Into
classes?" "Certainly I do," she an
swered warmly. "We cannot imagine
a government successful where the ser
vant may stay to his master 'I am as
good as you!' Dear me," she shud
dered, "it must be horrible to belong
to the same class as every dirty man
in the street."
"Oh. we don't invite the scavengers
to sit at our family board," I felt it my
duty to explain. "It is not inconsist
ent with Americanism to class our
selves as the clean and the unclean.
Of course the latter are not Irretrieva
bly doomed, since it is quite easy to
scrub up, should one feel so disposed."
As the conversation developed I
found it rather difficult not to betray
tho fact that our equality is so largely
a theory, and that we are not much
given to practicing what we preach.
A? T went out of the house I met thÂ«
old gentleman, who came forward and
offered me his arm, evidently in a
much better humor. "You do not love
our royal family simply because you
have not learned how noble and gener
ous they are," he said. "Mary, tell Miss
Green what you were telling me yes
terday about the Prince of Wales."
And then Mary told me this simple
story with the greatest approbation, a
story which she had heard from her
maid, who in turn had heard it from
the shoemaker in question.
During the recent trouble of the
Prince with a broken leg this indi
vidual was employed to make a sort of
brace for the imperial foot of. the royal
anatomy. Naturally all of his ingenuity
was exercised, and the result proved
most satisfactory. One day he re
ceived notice to call at Marlborough
House on a certain day at a certain
hour. Arriving exactly, he found It
necessary to wait a very long time for
his Royal Highness, who at length ap
peared very regretful for the delay. "I
must apologize to you," he said, in his
most amiable rrianner. "I realize that
your time is most valuable and should
never have kept you waiting, but a
man called to see n~e whom I could not
dispose of. I must assure you, sir, that
I feel very humble in the presence of
such genius as yours." Thereupon he
presented him with a pin bearing his
crest in diamonds. The shoemaker
since then has undoubtedly raised his
prices, and I have no doubt that his
patrons are glad to pay the increase for
the privilege of patronizing the man to
whom the Prince apologized. The
Prince is certainly very popular
among her Majesty's subjects. Such
acts of affability as the shoemaker in
cident seem to atone most bountifully
for all his many escapades. "He is
very good now," every one agrees,
with a most forgiving emphasis on the
"now " In Paris, however, different
tales are told. The Prince spends much
of his time in the ay French capital
tinder a comfortable incog, and more
than one Parisian actress is advertised
as his favorite. His face is quite as
familiar to Parisians as to the people
of London, arid on account of his in

woman. The meat of the stories is hap
pily hinted at in -well-selected introduc

is interesting because, as does not often
happen in real life, when busy crowds
are elbowing, a young woman makes her
happiness and domestic fortune by sacri
ficing her heart's longing to make an old
friend happy. Pictures of social struggle
for recognition are well drawn, and some
apt, terse speeches are used, as for In

mons â did not infrequently rumple up
waves when otherwise all might have
been smooth sailing." The bad genius of

we often meet in real life, who may be
summed up in the author's words thus:
"The watched people go out and in, took
stock of their clothes, their movements,
their manners and their affections. She
did not like it if young visitors were
taller or smarter or wittier than her own
offspring." The book takes its name from
the initial story and is well worth the
time spent In reading it.

A SAW FRANCISCO
INVENTION IS THE
LATEST TERPSICH
OREAN NOVELTY.
/""Y HOULD the Muse Terpsichore
\Oy visit Pan Francisco to-day she
V J would find here a childish treas-
N -/ ure that would delight her heart.
Infantile dancers there are
here, mid many, who have danced
themselves into the affections of an ad
miring public and won for themselves
far more than local fame. But there is
one little native son of the Golden Gate
city who is something really phenom
enal In his own special lines, and thone
lines radiate in various directions.
His name is Arnold Orazer, and he
first saw the light of day nine short
years ago, but he has danced almost
from the time that hs began to balance
himself unsteadily upon his small and
wobbly feet. His whole sensitive little
body thrilled to the throb and rhythm
of music before he could speak the
words that told how much he loved it;
and as soon as he could safely walk
alone he began to invent, before a long
mirror, little dances of his own which
were marvels of grace and rhythmical
movement.
Fortune has favored him, for his par
ents have been able to give him every
advantage in the way of Instruction for
the developing: and perfecting of his
special talent. Placed first under the
care of the best local teachers, he later
became a pet pupil of the celebrated
Janseuse. Madame Bonfanti. then of
New York, and afterward took a course
<jt lessons from Katharine Bartho, thÂ«
famous Russian premiere.
For the past two years little Arnold
has be^n .allowed to exercise his truly
wonderful gift, both professionally and
at various benefit and charity enter
tainments, and whenever he has ap
peared he has made a most signal suc
cess. It is. however, a matter of pride
to him. young as he is, that his public
triumphs are won on purely artistic
rather than personal grounds.
While he possesses all the charm of
unspoiled and ingenuous childhood, com
bined with a -winning grace of manner
which could not fail to predispose even
a most cold and critical audience In
his favor from the moment of his first
appearance before them, the good-na
tured indulgence invariably shown to a
child's efforts at entertainment is so\m
succeeded by surprised admiration, In
which the consideration of greater or
less years has no place, and.discrim
inating applause such as is won alone
by real merit and not bestowed simply
to please the recipient.

elation of the many difficulties -which
have to b<- surmounted in order to be
come even a passable danc*r in any
one fine of this graceful and always
charming: art, this small Arnold cannot
but seem little if any short of being an
absolute phenomenon. It require?, we
are told, years of p^r.sist^nt and pains
taking- effort and application to make
even iho most ambitious and persever
ing pupil into an acceptable toe-dancer.
And we are, moreover, assured that
such a pupil once having acquired the
ability to move about more or less
gracefully on the tips of the feet, in
stead of in the manner intended by
nature, is forever debarred from arriv
ing at anything save mere mediocrity
in any of the other styles of fancy
dancing.
The reason for this, It is said, is that
constant practice with the feet in the
perfectly unnatural position, which is
necessitated hy toe-dancing, first
strains the muscles and tendons and
Joints and then has a tendency to so
harden and stiffen them that anything
like the pliability necessary for step
dancing of any kind becomes an utter
Impossibility. While this may be, and
undoubtedly is, true in the generality of
cases, It certaintly has not been in the
case of Arnold Grazer. His tiny feet
and ankles instead of Incurring the pen
alty of partial rigidity through his de
fiance of anatomical rules and regula
tions, seem to have gained by the
means a most unusual degree of pliabil
ity, and to have been rendered capable
of doing more astonishing things than
feet and ankles ever did before.
Of late Dr. Grazer, Arnold's father,
has been engaged in perfecting an ar
rangement of mirrors and colored lights
designed to exhibit the young dancer
In a most novel and original way during
a "turn" in which his varied talents

hearsal of this newest Invention in the
way of stage entertainment proves the
setting to be something so out of the
ordinary in the line of spectacular
effect and the "turn" so unusually ex
cellent of itself as to merit more than
cursory mention.
The background â a sextuple screen of
immense mirrors â is at first reminis
cent of Ilerr (!. yon Palm's inventions
which so increased the charms of La
IxÂ»ie Fuller, Papinta and several other
danseqses, who have delighted an en
thusiastic public by their manifold
beauties. There is, however, a distinc
tive quality about these especial pieces
of reflecting glass which becomes strik
ingly apparent later on, and, in the es
timation of the uninitiated, adds to
Arnold's performance an element very
nearly, if not quite, approaching to the
marvelous.
With the lights turned on well in
front little Arnold makes his entrance
with all the sang froid of a mature
actor of established and world-wide
reputation. Pink shoes and pink tights,
a white satin coat and vest, a red bo-u
--tonniere, a tall white hat perched upon
the curly blonde hair and a cane In the
dimpled white hands complete a cos
tume that is as richly elegant as It ia
becoming, and the "coon song" which
the little actor sings in a clear strong
voice is one to "bring down the house
wherever heard. Buck and wing danc!
ing of the moat approved type alter
nates with the melodious stanzas, dur
ing the last one of which a most won
derful thing happens.
The polished mirrors, which have
heretofore shown us six small pink
tighted and white-satin- clad figures,
bowing, 'gesticulating, smiling and do
ing simply surprising things with their
pink-booted feet in unison with the
graceful little boy who holds the cen
ter of the . stage, become suddenly
transparent and Arnold's vocal apos
trophes to his charmer, who, he de
clares, is "sweet as sugar cane," arÂ«
addressed to a lovely little maiden who
becomes instantly and mysteriously
visible, seated. Juliet fashion, in a bal
cony at the rear of the stage.
The whole effect is for the moment
bewildering, and is the result of lone
study of the properties of certain chem
icals and the lavs of reflection and re
fraction. All through little Arnold's
turn the possibilities of this combina
tion of glasa and Ingenuity are ex
ploited to the utmost and the result is
delightful in the highest degree. Ar
nold and his little par'ner, pretty Ruth-
Rollins, appear and disappear in the
most surprising and apparently inex
plicable manner. At one moment they
are on the stage dancing like fairies in
company with a dozen other small peo
ple, all similarly costum-il and all vy
ing with each other in the matter of
steps and postures. An instant later
and a solitary couple are waltzing lrÂ»
a moonlit garden undor a canopy of
dew-heavy roses, and their fairy com
panions have disappeared apparently
into thin air. The whole thing is as
fascinating to the eye as it is confus
ing to tht> average mind.
When little Arnold, costumed and
"made up" in exact likeness of his fa
mous teacher. Katharine Bartho. comes
In a whirl of billowy lace and shimmer
ing silk and dances one of "the divine
Bartho's" own especial dances on the
very tiptops of his little toes.'six other
imitation premieres perform the same
difficult feats with just as much ease
and grace as does the flesh-and-blood
.sprite who looks identically like the
IBartho viewed through the wrong end
iof an opera glass. When he does the
more than difficult "ankle rock step,"
in which he rivals his quondam in
structor, half a dozen other Katharines
proceed to prove conclusively that it is
really not so very difficult after all;
when he crosses the stage on the points
of his pink slippers the half dozen pick
up their fluffy petticoats and march and
countermarch, and meet him, and back
away from him, and circle around him
until the whole place seems to be a
whirlpool of feminine finery, and pretty
faces, and gracefully beckoning arms,
and utterly entrancing pink legs. A
single pirouette fills the whole place
with apparently feininine- dancing der
vishes, and over all the beautiful col
ored lights hover and change from mo
ment to moment until they all blend
into the combined hues of the rainbow,
and then â presto! Katharine Bartho's
kittle impersonator is walking quite se
dately along a river bank under the
soft light of twinkling stars, with no
company whatever save that of his own
sweet self.
A Cakewalk participated In by four
teen contestants, all of whom are
equally proficient in this modern fash
ionable amusement, is as altogether
lovely as a cakewalk can possibly be.
Little Ruth, a plump little darling of
eight happy summers, does well her
own share toward making this feature,
and all the others in which she has a
part, the pronounced success that they
are. She is pretty, graceful and thor
oughly self-possessed and Is well
trained in that her training is not the
conspicuous feature of her work, and
she has the charm so infrequently re
tained by children in public life of per
fect naivete and naturalness.
To prove the lithesomeness of his
limbs and the versatility of his accom
plishments. Arnold changes from one
style of performance to another as
easily as another child would change
from walking to hop-skip-and-jump
and back again.
He gives a truly wonderful exhibition
of the possibilities of toe-work to one
who is an adept in that difficult branch
of his art. He dances on one foot and
then on the other, he goes across the
stage and back again, he pirouettes, he
bends and sways, and goes forward and
backward, and does perfectly unbeliev
able things, in fact â all on the very tips
of his toes and without once deviating
from the straight line that runs from
his knee down through those tense and
firm little ankles to the point of con
tact with the floor.
And then he bursts upon our view
robed in a most fetching silken suit of
emerald green and does an Irish jig
with as much sprightliness and grace
as if he had devoted his whole short
life to the task of mastering the details
of that popular diversion, and he fol
lows this up by a kind of heavenly
hornpipe, in which he appears in a
sailor suit of such transcendent beauty
as would tempt most of us to run away
to sea were it the custom of our gallant
captains to furnish their crews with
garbs of such a kind.
The finale of this most delightful pri
vate entertainment was a military
march, participated in by both Arnold
and Ruth.
Both children bear silken American
flags in their hands and use them most
effectively in the mazes of the magic
march that follows, during which the
stage seems full of little girls and boys
going through the most graceful and
complicated of evolutions amid a flut
tering of flags here, there and every
where, and under the glorifying bene
diction of lights now soft, now bright,
long rays weaving together a canopy
over the small heads and single rays
searching out the happy childish faces
and bringing them into bright relief
against the glittering background of
the polished mirror surfaces. Up and
down they go, and around and around;
and the flags flutter now close together,
now far apart, and the smiling faces
look at us from every angle and cor
ner, and the little feet tread the most
intricate of measures, until of a sudden
the lights go down.
Then the laughing crowd of children
vanishes into thin air; the mirrors, too,
disappear, and in their place we behold
a wall covered with an artistic drapery
composed of the loved banner of our
country, and in the center of the stage
stand Ruth and Arnold alone with their
flagstaff s crossed, the silken folds of
their flags floating aloft just touching
their reverently bowed heads as in
silent blessing.
Such Is the "turn" -which is just now
engrossing the attention of little Arnold
Grazier. It is well worth the seeing, is
it not? But, unfortunately for the many
who would be more than glad to look
upon it, for the present it is only on
'â¢'private view."DAY BY DAY WITH GENERAL SHAFTER
(~>f rRELY the lines of a eomiriand-
ing officer of the United States
V J army have never fallen In pleas
r*"^ anter quarters than the Black
Point military home of Major
General Shafter. There is perhaps no
more beautiful spot in the Union than
the rocky promontory by the Western
sea.
Any visitor who cares to bask In the
sunlight of a summer day, refreshed by
deliciousiy cool winds from the west
and intoxicated with the perfume of
trailing nasturtiums that cover the
steep banks, can find no better resting
place than at Black Point.
"I say, I really cannot let you In with
that camera, don't you know?"
And the mounted orderly on guard
outside the ponderous iron gate at
Black Point sprang: from his horse,
"touched his eyebrow," stood attention
and towered abova me In his formidable
spurs and Jingling armament.
Perhaps, I feebly suggested, perhaps
by order of the commanding officer I
can smuggle this unwelcome machine
Into the grounds? Perhapsâ but Iâ lt
was not necessary to- finish the sen
tence.
Cap In hand and obeisance low, hÂ©
waved me permission to pass.
An appointment with the comman
der-ln-chlef was quite a different thin*.
. The house occupied by General Shaf
ts is the first building approached
from the gate. It is flanked on the east
and south by acres of closely propped
lawn, and commands magnificent views
of.AJcatraz, the sheeny waters of the
bay and a fine glimpse of the San Fran
cisco harbor.
Tt was at an early hour that I pressed
the electric button to General Shafter'a
cuter reception room.
The bell vas promptly answered by
Mariano, a Cuban boy, whom the gen
eral brought with him tram Havana.
If the general is not busy answering
telegraphic messages or other impor
tant business the visitor is not kept
waiting, but is admitted at once to his
presence.
The great clock on the mantel was
â triking eight.
"The general is at breakfast," an
nounced the boy.
Would I. wait? Oh, yes; and study
in the meantime the great quiet that
pervaded the atmosphere in the home
of peaceâ a quiet which ever hovers
around affairs momentous and is a har
b!ns?Â».-r of happiness In domestic life.
The reception room is furnished in
red; the ceiling is low and the walls
are covered with red tapestry.
An old-fashioned stairway cuts the
middle of this room on the south and
at its right opens a door leading to the
general's office.
Thefcreception room gives one the feel
ing of quiet luxury,, without useless
bric-a-brac, but I knew when I entered
that a woman's hand had fashioned the
comforts of the house. I knew by the
flowers in the vase, by the easy ar
rangement of furniture, by the pictures
on the wall, by the thousand and
one little earmarks that do not disguise
a woman's touch. The taste was ex
quisite and lacked the furniture store
"stay where I place you" order of
things. : ,* ;lt "<*!'â ._â â  r
And the woman whose individuality
lurked- in the arrangement of Black
Point quarters is none other than
General Shatter's own gracious daugh
ter, Mrs. McKittrick, the wife of Cap
tain McKittrick of the commander's
staff. :;?t:^.
"I am so sorry to have kept you
waiting," said a kindly voice from the
doorway, then General Shatter, with a
bearjtful pf Byjnpathjr for^the^br.ead-li
winners, advanced with extended hand.
"Mary!" he called to his daughter, as
Captain and Mrs. McKittrick came Into
the room, "allow me to present Miss
Lee."
And oh what a happy trio I found
them; and these three individuals com
prise the family of the house of Shatter.
"Nothing could be simpler and more
methodical than father's dally life,"
â aid Mrs. McKittrick. "Why, he eats
by military discipline and sleeps the
least of any man I ever heard of. I
cannot understand how he bears up
under his active life with so little rest.
I really do not believe that he gets.
more than three hours' sleep In the
fK-enty-four.
"We breakfast at 8 o'clock, then

Importance prevents we go out for an
hour's ride â sometimes to the Presidio
and frequently to the park. Then very
often we return to find his office filled
with women and crying: babies to plead
for their husbands' discharge."
Even as she talked the doorbell rang
and three women were admitted to his
Â»tudy, which is in. the couth wing of the
bouae.
The general left us In the outer room

floated through the open door.

Kittrlck, and we suddenly fell Into si
lence.
One woman wanted a pass on the
transport that she might Join her hus
band in Manila. And the otherâ we
did not hear what Bhe asked, but we
heard the general's question, "Upon
what grounds?" Then the timid
woman's voice betrayed her emotion,
but strengthened her purpose, and ehe
said,' half shyly:
"Because â Mr. Shifter, because â I
Just can't live without h'ir.."
"What did you let h!m go for?"
queried the sympatheilc judge.
. "Well, you ace, I didn't know that I
really cared so much." Then, hesitat
ingly, "We were only married last
month; and I hadn't time to f.r.d out
until ho had gone."
A prolonged "O h" was-the com
mander's reply.
Now I am'sorry that I cannot tell you
how that little matter ended, for the
next Instant the hostess brought me a
letter from a Philadelphia shoe firm
asking what eize of shoes her father
wore â the style, kind of leather, and
wanted to know how many pairs he
usually kept on hand.
""Why, this is only one of the many,

be answered.
"I mean these letters from the chris

sends each one a souvenir spoon.
"Father goes to his office at 9:80 a.

afternoon, then comes home to dinner.
Very often he is kept busy until 8
o'clock giving advice or listening to the
troubles of mothers whose sens have
gone to war, or to the wives of soldiers
left behind.
"It Is such a long way out here and
he cannot beer to disappoint them, and
I have known him to cancel evening en
gagements Just that he might give com

Mi*. McKittrick, like her father, Is
unspoiled by social success.
We passed â  through' the -music- room
to a room in the east wing which over
looks the bay and contains curios, In
dian trinkets v and battle trophies,
brought from Pine Ridge and Santiago.
Aftev we had examined battle axes,
machetes" and Spanish cannon of which
volumes might be written, Mrs. McKit
trick suggested that we hunt for

with a laugh, "although he cannot ex-
"You have heard about the mascot
hen, haven"t you?" she said, laughing
ly. "No? Then have father ten you."
**Oh, that Is an old story," the general
modestly answered; "in fact, I knew
but little about it until the chicken was
brought to me. My aids found a half
starved Cuban boy who came from a
destitute family. They gave him a good
dinner, then packed a burro with pro
visions, set him on top and started him
out for horne â never expecting to see
him again.
"Two or three days later the little fel
low came back with his hand thrust
Into the bosom of hi 3 ragged shirt, and
held it there until he stood before me,
when, to my surprise, he drew out hia
hacd and gave me this chicken.
"A chicken in that desolate country
was an extraordinary sight â no one
knew where he found it â and he only
said, 'Muchas gracias," and leaving the
Chicken In my hand he ran away.
"5Ve kept that chicken. It roosted in
Â» birdcage until it grew too large, and
frequently perched upon the headboard
of my bed.
"But now come and look at Toral. I
am very proud of him, I assure you."
"Toral came from Santiago, also,"
â¢aid Captain McKittrick, patting the
pony's head, "and we have named him
Toral' after his former master, from
whom we captured him."
"Now, what do you prize most of all
of your battlefield spoils, General Shat
ter?"
"Mariano," interrupted his daughter,
with a laugh, "although he cannot ex
actly be called a relic of war. Father
Is very fond of him and will keep him
as lons as he wishes to remain."
"Mariano's relatives were perfectly
willing for him to come with father and
knew that he would have the advan-
ta.se of travel denied to him in Ha
vana."
Just then an orderly camÂ© up tne ave
nue, leading General Shafter's horse.
"It is not a very fine-looking animal,
is It?" remarked the general. "Every
body seems to be afraid of him." Then
he laughed heartily.
"What is his name?"
" 'Bill,' " was the emphatic answerâ
"not a very pretty name, is It?"
"Do you knov;." said his daughter,
drawing me aside, "I am dreadfully
frightened every time I see him go out
on that horse. Why? 'Bill' kicks and
cuts such great capers, especially when
he has not been exercised Cor a day."
The general overheard the conversa
tion . and good-naturedly suggested:
"Only one end of 'Bill' goes up at a
time when I am r>n his back."
"That's so," said Captain McKlttrick.
There is such # feeling of genuine
affection in this little family of three,
a quiet, undefinable warmth and trust
that speak lo\ider than words of a con
tented home.
Orderlies are constantly coming and
going with messages.
Communications by telephone and
telegraph continually speak of the com
mander's busy life.
The life of no prominent public man
is exempt from severe criticism; his
rapacious enemies, for he has enemies,
have censured him, nnd yet in spite of
these malicious attacks, he bus ignored
his ;:ssailants by dignified silence.
But of those who know him intimate
ly, who judge of his generosity and
consideration for others, these know
him best who have visited his home
and shared an hour with the indulgent
father and the modest commander of
the Department of the Pacific.

The Study of
Weather Signs
Now that the time for excursions to the
seashore and mountains has come a hint
or two on weather prophecy will be op
portune. When clouds are red in the
west, the red having a purple tint, it is
a sign of line weather. The air when dry
refracts red or heat-making rays, and
as dry air is not perfectly transparent,

An old proverb says:
"A rainbow in the morning Is the shep-
herd's warning.
A rainbow at night is the shepherd's de
light."
A rainbow occurs when the clouds con
taining or depositing the rain are oppo
eit" to the sun. In the evening the rain
bow is In the east, and in the morning
It is In the west. As the heavy rains in
this climate are usually brought by the
â¢westerly winds, a rainbow in the west In
dicates that bad weather is on the road:
whereas the rainbow in the east proves
the contrary.

The Ondovlllas occupy the front

rooms, lofty >>f frescoed celling, with
exquisite carvings around the mantels,

a wide veranda and a sweep of granite

and a graveled carriageway. One of
the windows is bowered with hanging

these the senora tends carefully during
the hours when her daughters are ab

began. It was more like work than dan

on the verge of apoplexy. Faster and

away with might and main. The dancers
obeying every command of the caller
rushed back and forth, from side to side;
now whirling around at a breakneck
speed at "swing your pardnÂ«rs"â now
standing still.
Those' waiting to join the figure put in
their time jigging or rather ragging, stop

and swayed. It was like a small earth
quake. "Swing your pardners â all prom

There was a rush for seats, thank

"Miss Waterman, 'low me to make you

This broke the spell. I raised my eyes

gnats, and flies and gnats usually delight
in warm strata of air. As warm air is
lighter and molstier than cold air, the
warm strata of air runs higher, but when
the warm and moist air is close to the
ground, it is almost certain that, as the
cold air Rows down into it, water will
fall.
As nn indication of the approach of wet

halo around the moon, which is produced
by the precipitated water; and the larper

Observation teaches that when the sea
gulls assemble on land stormy and rainy
weather is approaching. The little petrel
enjoys the heaviest gale, because, living
partly on the smaller sea insects, he is
sure to find his food in the spray of heavy
waves. The fish on which they prey in
fine weather at sea leave the surface and
go down deeper during the storm. The
different tribes of wading birds always
migrate when rain is about to take place.
Upon the same principle the vulture fol

Â°The sight which met her eyes when
she opened the door that she had closed
behind her so brief a space before, with
no thought that she was shutting in the
grim Angel of Tragedy behind It, was
enough to daunt the bravest soul.
She had left her mother sitting in a
low rocker beside the open bed, which
was arranged for the night, brushing
out her hair by the mellow light of a
large porcelain lamp that sat on a stand
close at hand. It had been a pleasant
picture of .quiet contentment after a
well-spent day.

lurid and crater-like glow on the floor
in one corner. The dim light from the
hall, together with this smoky glare,
made visible an overturned light stand,
a porcelain lamp shade broken into bits
on the carpet, her mother's day gar
ments hanging neatly over a. chairback
and a closed folding bed standing
straight and tail in the center of the
For one instant the senorita stood on
the threshold as if turned to stone.
What had happened? Why was the
table thrown over and the snaae
broken? And where was her mother.'
Another instant and her keen
woman's brain made the situation fa
tally clear to her. -^
Impatient of her delay, the mother had
finished her preparations for the night
and refred. The folding bed, imper
fectly balanced, vibrating under her
suddenly imposed weight, had swiftly
and silently closed of its own volition,
making her a .helpless captive in a

lamp, a half-gallon reservoir of explo

âperhaps a suffocatedâ prisoner in that
treacherous -piece of mechanism before
her.
One step the senitora made toward
the place where her mother was being
torturedâ it might be unto death. And
thenâ
The flames in the corner shot up
higher. The lamp was lying on its

popular door.
The girls flirted and smirked and smiled
and danced. The old ladies had gossiped
themselves clear out of gossip. The chil

But the few moments that would be re

her mother from its choking embrace
would make that whirl of name a cer

As in a vision, the senorita saw before
her horror-widened eyes the awful,
maddening, death-dealing terror which
would till that quiet house with the first
knowledge that the fire fiend had
claimed it for his own. The frantic
men trying to save their dear onesâ
the mothers with their babes clasped to
their heartsâ the little children wa
kened from their innocent dreams to
face Azrael's cruelest weapon.
She seemed to see their terrified faces.
She seemed to hear the roar of the all
devouring flanws, and through it the
mingled shrieks and prayers of the
flames' victims ringing in her agonized
ears.
And then, higher and clearerâobe
dience-compelling â she heard the Voice
of Her Soul.
She crossed the room with the swift
ness, of thought and lifted the blazing
lamp in her two white and slender
hands. The brass burner and> neck
band were red hot. The cone was full
of angry fire. The oil was dripping
through her fingers. Sho-uld it explode,
then her whole fair young body would
be enveloped in blistering, charring
blaze. The beauty which was hers in
life would be unimaginable hideousness
in death. And the hall door was so far
â so horribly far â away!
She dared not run, lest the rush of
air mi^ht fan the flame higher, or send
it down intÂ«.- the heated stratum of gas
above the oil in the bomb-like globe.
She could only walk steadily forward â
and pray.
Thank God! the door had been left
ajar.
She put the toe of her tiny slipper In
the opening and pushed it back with
all her strength. The heavy door swung
on its massive hinges. A rush of night
air struck coldly on her face.
The lamp flared h,igh with an omi
nous, ga-sping splutter. And then, with
all the force of her numbed arms, she
flung it from her, to crash into a thou

The senora was not dead, although
sho seomed so when her daughter first
clasped her arms about her, and it was
many days before she fully recovered

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF CLEOPATRA' S BARGE IN EXISTENCE.
PHOTOGRAPHED FROM THE FAMOUS PAINTING BY PICON. THfIT HAS JUST BEEN PRESENTED TO THE MfiRK, HOPK.INS INSTITUTE OF ART BY C. P. HUNTINOTON.
HOW LEVI P. MORTON IS LIVING OUT
HIS FOURSCORE YEARS.
IF the position of President of the
United States has proved fatal to Its
holders that of Vice President has
been no less so. Judges of the Su
preme Court have lived beyond their
terms and have passed Into the full
ness of the eighties, but Presidents and
Vice President? have lived or.!y just long
enough to say good-by to the chair that
had held them for four years. Filled with
honor they have passed away, overworked
perhaps in those full years when the sys
tem will bear no overcrowding, and so laid
aside with their predecessors.
To-day there are living only two former
Vice Presidents of the United States. Levl
P. Morton, wiry old athlete and man of
wealth, survives and is strong and well
In his seventy-fifth year.
Levl P. Morton was born at Shoreham,
Vfc, opposite old Fort Ticonderoga, the
eon of a Congregational minister; and he
drank In the cool air of upper New York
and learned the scripture at the same
time. That was in 1524 and the following
years, but though the path has been long
Blnce then he has never lost the health,
mentally or morally, of sweet Vermont.
Morton had an elder brother, Daniel
Oliver Morton Jr., and his father, whose
salary as pastor of the church never < x
ceeded $*">OO a year, decided to invest all
the family savings in his eldest son. So,
forgetting the four daughters and Levl
Parsons, he educated Daniel and turned
him out Into the world a scholar.
At the age of 14 Levl P. engaged in a
small grocery business for moneys sake,
and when he was 26 he entered Into busi
ness at Boston, removing to New York
four years later to form the firm of Mor
ton & Grlnnell.
He saved his money and It grew pro
digiously. By the time he was 40 years
old the minister's aon was a banker in
New York, and in another year he had a
banking business in London. Everything
turned Into money.
When still a young man bÂ« married Miss
Street of Poughkeepsle, and Just as the
money came freely she left him. Mrs.
Morton died at Newport in a lovely cot
tage called Fairlawn. After her death Mr.
Morton presented Fairlawn to Newport
â¢with the twelve acres upon which It
stands. But to this dayâ so it is saidâ he
will not visit there. Not even stop at the
station, though another wife and many

and desirous of possessing an

tongue, being a sort of passport and af
fording me immunity from the toll gatu

Arriving at the encampment at twilight,
a scene of great beauty burst upon^ me.
The stars were beginning to blaze forth
â¢with unusual size and brilliancy through
the wonderfully rare atmosphere. Threads
of smoke rose perpendicularly from th-f3
â¢which sparkled among the long, low, wldrt
tents, where preparations for the evening

"Sheik Hassam, a man of noble appear
ance, met me, and after reading the let
ter, at once relaxed the stern dignity- of
his countenance, and the supper being
now ready, bade me partake of the same
tray with himself. The meal consisted of
kkrs flesh roasted delicately with certain
condiments of the nature of eau de
cologne, end washed down with mare's
milk. A noble cup of coffee, however;
atoned* for the singularity of this repast,
and lighting cheroots of a strong, sweet
flavor, we strolled among the horses,
much of whose beauty and fine points
were observable In the moonlight, for that
luminary had now risen above the horizon.
For reasons of his own the sheik cer
tainly did his best to get me what I
wanted, and out of fifty, every one of
which seemed to possess some different
charm, I chose one and regretted that I
had not chosen ail tne others. I was
loth to leave so romantic a spot, and,
though duty called, lingered some days,
the guest of the sheik, who seemed
equally unwilling to have me go, and
plied me with rare tobacco and still rarer
legends, dusky happenings of desert land,
Which had come within his ken, and re
vealed to few. I began to feel as If I had
chewed the lotus buds and did not care
greatly whether I returned to my native
land or not.

" ' "Allah be praised! We shall prosper

cistern, which was filled from the springs

"Say. Morton, were you born in a banking
house?
"No," lauerhpd the flnan<-!or. "I was born
in a parsonape. And so was my mother
before mo; and so was my lather. My pa
rents and grandparents were ministers
from time not worth counting."
"Wore they rich?"
"Only in heavenly promise. They hadn't
any money."
So, with ancestors to whom the Golden
Streets were a vague dream, this young
man became the financier of both worlds.
Of course wealthy men make friends
and Mr. Morton formed the acquaintance
of another minister's son in New York-
Chester A. Arthur, himself afterward Vice
President and President of the United
States. Arthur came from a little south
of Morton, but both were from New York
State.
At the solicitation of Mr. Arthur, Levl
P. Morton entered Into politics on the Re
publican side, thus breaking down all
family traditions, for the Mortons wera
Democrats.
In 1880 President Garfield appointed Mr.
Morton \unister to France, and, taking
five little girls with him â for there were
five lovely blossoms upon the family bush
â he went abroad and for four years ably
sustained the diplomatic reputation of the
country, though during that time he was
quite ill. the rumor of his sinking state re
peatedly reaching this country.
Eight years later, in ISBSâ the Cleveland
administration having Intervenedâ Mr.
Morton ran on the Harrison ticket for
Vice President of the United States and
was elected at the age of 6*. Many sup
posed him younger.
At the expiration of his term as Vica
President Mr. Morton asked to retlra to

the oasis was wide and of densest growth)
to obtain supplies of water.
" 'Here and there we encountered beaten
paths, which struck us as being rather
singular, as we had seen no living thing
save birds. Possibly, we argued, they
were made by the jackals, which howled
about in the "daytime and went there for
water after dark, although on one occa
sion I could have sworn that a vague im
print in the sandy pathway was that of a
beast of prey.
" 'I kept a sharp lookout and sentinels
ever on watch about the horses, camels
and goats tethered a short distance from
the camp beneath leafy sheds. Nothing
of note transpired for some days, except
slight additional proofs from time to time
that some living creature inhabited the
place. The heat seemed to increase daily
and the sky assumed that reddish tinge
which bodes no good to the dweller in the
desert. At rare intervajs across the yel
low hillocks would come pirouetting dia
bolical little spirals of sand, moved by
puffs of wind, like breaths from a fur

well for the term; and during the McKln

Suddenly we perceived him at the edge
of the Jungle, wildly gesticulating. The
Arabs* rifles were at their shoulders in an

and roar, a flash of tawny flanks, and
Hamed, dragged down from behind, dis

" 'The riflemen who had been nearest to

threat of instant death, follow with a
lance, and plunged into the tangled wood
at the spot where Hamed had disap

caution along a path grown steep and

" 'The terrible odor had grown almost
stifling, and mingling with it came a low,
whining purr, apparently at no great dis

Crouching behind a .ragged mass of
rock which seemed to have been split by

mane rose a white neck of columnar
strength, -surmounted by a countenance
of awful beauty. Beneath netted eye
brows glowed eyes like burnished brass,
human in all save tHe slitlike pupils. The
lips were a venomous red arch, through
which flashed long canine teeth.

boulder, lay Hamed. white and limp, but

A word about Ellerslle-. It Is consid
ered by experts the finest country placa
in the world. Lying on the banks of the.
Hudson, it consists of hundreds of rolling
acres carpeted with the best of grass. So
nearly related is it to the blue grass of
Kentucky that the cows that pasture
upon this land give milk richer than those
upon the isle of Jersey.
Ellerslle not only affords a magnificent
country home for the Morton family, but
it yields an Income as well, for the Ellers
lle dairy is far famed. Its products are
sold by contract for years ahead, so it is
said. The cattle upon Ellerslie are
shipped all over the world and the farm
is as productive of gold as the banking
house was forty years ago.
Mr. Morton is not a Henry George man.
His money works and brings him in an
Income. He owns a mighty building op
posite the New York Postofflceâ the big
gest skyscraper yet built. He also owns
buildings behind it and whole blocks up
town. It is said that Levi P. Morton has
$40,000,000 in New York real estate, but
that may be an exaggeration.
The life of this ex-Vice President of the
United States is singularly simple. Ha
has become so attached to his country
place that he seldom leaves it and, though
he allows hia family the luxury of a Fifth
avenue home in winter, he does not al
ways remain with them. When he visits
the city it is on business. But so great
is his stamina that though past the age
limit of man he can spend a whole day
at business, riding in a cab from building
to building, visiting his agents, inspecting
and giving orders, meeting directors and
living as much of life in one day as many
men live in a month.
Back at Ellerslie, he dons his loose coat,
visits the stables, frolics with the kennels
and is again a country gentleman.
Mr Morton's acquaintances are world
wide and his autograph collection of pri
vate letters is a wonderful one. He Is
said to be writing a history of the Repub
lican rarty for the last twenty years; but
it Is doubtful if he will undertake that
which has often been urged upon himâ a
history of his own life.

mule riding and other rough equestrian
work. When t! I.''1 .'' exhibitions and con

On Tuesday the Indian games, Indian
rabbit chasing, and in the evening the
weird, fantastic dances of the Mexican
peons, afforded the teachers a better
idea of the old-time native fandango
than all the descriptions ever written
could do. That they enjoyed the scene
was amply proven by the showers of
Mexican pennies that rained upon the
floor, after some particularly pleasing
dance had been given. But it was on
Wednesday night, the last of the fiesta,

great fandango, or bal masque, was
given, and those who remained to wit
ness or partake in it will never forget

etiquette which, in America, preclude

with his Inamorata with his spurs on.

dance went on, every one happy and
content. And when it ended and the
waiting train was reached it was a
sleepy, wearied crowd that wended Its
way back to San Diego, satisfied, but
not surfeited, with the glimpse it had
had of high life in the land of the Mon
