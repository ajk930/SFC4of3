News is brought of two stampedes from
Dawson. They occurred almost simul

the vicinity of Selkirk, where two creeks
were discovered running from 50 cents to
$2 to the pan: the other is tb a tine quartz
lead on Rock Creek, about thhty-flve
miles north of Dawson. where a local as
saver found values of.JITOO to $3200 gold.
Ed Price of Dawson has returned from

SAX DOMINGO. Aug. 16.â Another
invasion from Hayti was attempt
ed yesterday. The Government
forces met the Insurgents near
Monte-Cristi, and after lively fighting
the invaders "were dispersed, and some
of them it is reported were captured.
This may end the trouble in that sec
tion, as the revolutionary movement
apparently lacks organization, and is
sporadic in its nature. The revolution
ists so far have carried on only a guer
rilla warfare, and the Government is
therefore not dismayed by the out
breaks. Reports from the interior say
that everything is quiet.
During the celebrations incident to
the national holiday there wero demon
strations this evening in the Plaza
Colon in this city by th^ younger citi
zens against the Government Speeches
calculated to excite the people were
made, and a proclamation signed by
business men and lawyers was distri
buted. It demanded that the present
i officials retire in favor of new men, but
it disclaimed any intention of accom
plishing the change by force.
Several of the leaders were arrested,
and the trouble now seems at an end,
but the Incideni shows that discontent
exists. The people generally are hope
ful thai the civil troubles will soon be
I settled.

ON THE WITNESS STAND ROGET SHOWS
HIS BITTER HATRED FOR DREYFUS
RENNES, Aug. 17 7:20 a. in.
The trial by court-martial of Cap
tain Dreyfus was resumed this
(Thursday) morning without inci
dent. A

sition, first dealing with the theft
of Esterhazy's letters from â  Mile.

-- Dreyf ub and M. Demange for an 4
+ adjournment Is variously com- +
â¦ mented upon by the Paris even- 4

4- L'Homme declares the decision 4
+ "dastardly," and protests in the 4
4 name of the accused against an 4
4 act that "diminishes his chance 4

4 The Temps says: "One can- +
4 not suppose that the Judges are 4
â â¦â  unanimously unfavorable to 4

4- proves that they are guided by 4

RENNES, Aug. 16.â second trial
by court-martial of Captain Alfred
Dreyfus of the French Artillery, charg
ed with treason, was resumed this
morning. Major Carriere, the represen
tative of the Government having re
fused to agree to an adjournment of
the case until Monday, applied for by
M. Demange. counsel for the prisoner,
and Captain Dreyfus, owing to the mur
derous attack upon M. Labori, leading
counsel for the defense.
The feature of the day's proceedings
was the story of the sufferings of Drey
fus on Devil's Island, his prison off the
coast of French Guiana. Dreyfus wept
in court when the clerk read a docu
ment recounting the details of his in
carceration. ; â "
i The proceedings opened with the ap
plication ,of M. Demange for an ad
journment. This was followed by the
deposition of M. Guerin, the former
Minister of Justice, who. however, only
; repeated the evidence he had given be
! fore the Court of Cassation.
J M.'.Lebon. .the "former Minister of the
'Colonies, a big red-bearded man. then
. testified in justification of his instruc
tions to treat Dreyfus rigorously, de
claring , that the extreme stringency
1 dated only from the time he thought
| an attempt would be made to rescue the
. prisoner.
Colonel Jouaust, president of the
court-martial, asked Dreyfus if he had
any questions to put to the witness and
he replied, in an emotional voice:
I "No, my colonel, lam here to defend
Imy honor. I do not wish to speak of
the atrocious suffering, physical and
; mental, which for five years I, a
I Frenchman, and an innocent man, was
subjected to on the He dv Diable."
M. Demange asked that the official re
: port of the treatment of Dreyfus on
the lie dv Diable, which was published
! in the newspapers last week, should be
i read. The clerk of the court did so,
and in a sympathetic tone, recounted
, the harrowing tale of Dreyfus' mental
; and physical sufferings, and inhuman
treatment on the island. ,â¢ ?
Deep-drawn breaths of indignation
came from the hearers as the reading
i proceeded. Dreyfus at first watched
the faces of the judges with his usual
; composure, but, gradually, as the story
i proceeded, and Incidents of his awful
existence were brought up before him.
his eyes grew dim and tears slowly
| trickled down his 'cheeks. Dreyfus
could stand it no longer, and . for the
i first time during his trial gave way to
his emotions and silently wept. The
faces of the audience expressed sym
pathy with the prisoner's emotion,
and even the captain of the gendarmes,
sitting beside â¢ Dreyfus, turned and
gave him a look of unconcealed com
passion.
General Mercier, who, with M.
Lebon. was seated in the front row of
the witnesses'; seats, listened to the
reading of the report unmoved, while
Colonel Jouaust 1 followed it with an air
of forced tolerance. '
M. Lebon afterward returned to the
stand and added a few more words in
justification of his conduct, and then
Colonel- Jouaust ordered the next wit
ness .to be brought in. All eyes were
turned toward the door on the right of
the stage, and a moment later the
form of a woman, dressed in deep
motrrning, appeared in the doorway
and, accompanied, by a non-commis
sioned officer, advanced to the plat
form. \ ; â ;â¢',â  v ; T v / â  ~.
It was the widow of Colonel Henry,
the French officer, who committed sui
cide in prison after confessing to
forging certain documents in the case.
I With pale face and hand upraised be
j fore the crucifix she took the oath to
tell the truth. Mine. Henry is of me
dium height and has a common caste
of feature, and certainly could not be
considered attractive. She at once put
: herself at ease, leaning forward' with
both hands resting on the rail of the
witness-stand.- In an attitude of com
plete self-possession* she gave her evi
dence, accompanying the words with
frequent gestures. Her evidence., how
ever, : was of little weight. She ad
mitted" the frequent visits of Esterhazy
to her husband and said her husband
told- her he had forged one , document
"in order to save the honor of the
country." She gave her evidence In a
matter-of-fact way, and was in no
wise the sympathetic figure .that anti-
Dreyfusards have tried to make her.
. " General Roget, in undress uniform,
followed. His evidence' was a vitriolic
diatribe against Dreyfus from begin-,
ning to end. -;
Ex-Mlnister of Justice Guerin. the first
witness, said he knew, absolutely nothing
of the facts in the case.' but could repeat
the surrounding circumstances which he
had already related ~to . the Court of

Madame henry deposed that toward

one evening, her husband told, her a paper

the. room;- holding the. papers and a Setter
which he. had just pieced -'togetner. .tie

"What was his impression on seeing

did not know the author -of ' it, but said
perhaps- Colonel . Fabre or 'Colonel d 1 Ab
beville knew. . 'â¢ ,â "Â° -â â¢ ' "- \
Continuing Mme. Henry said:' "When
my husband, returned from the Cherche

I. asjeed why he was on duty, and he an
swered: 'I "have/Just carried out the most
painful .task an officer can have. I havo
taken to the Cherche Midi : an officer ac
cused of the frightful crime of treason."
.Without Â° naming- 'Dreyfus '.he added: â¢ 'I

meaning that he acted in the Interests of
the country. -He used to say to me, 'For
thirty-three years I, have never acted ex
cept In the interest of .the country.'" .
â  Mme. Henry then remarked: "You
know his sentiments", gentlemen. He com
mitted.'forgery'- oh account of -Colonel
Plcquart's proceedings, and it was in pr
efer to save the' army, compromised, by
the dishonesty. of its enemies." Profound

â "Did' you ever hear," Colonel Jounust
a*kedÂ°the witness, "of a letter. Colonel
Henry is said to have : addressed to
Major Esterhazy?"
: "Never*" replied Mme. Henry!-
Mme. Henry, before concluding, re
turned to the subject of the forgery. She
evidently thought she could exonerate
her husband by, saying -he believed he
was justitied. In the interest of the coun
try. in inserting in the secret dossier new
and convincing material, pr,oof of which
â¢had reached him verbally a few days be
fore. . - â 
Turning to M. Demange the witness
added. "You understood what I meant?"
"No," promptly replied counsel for the
defense.
In answer to a Question of Colonel
Jouaust Mme. Henry declared she did not
know the name of the person who had
given her husband this .verbal informa
tion. f
On leaving the witness box Mme. Henry
looked sternly at the prisoner.
General Roget followed. He traversed
the old ground, giving his reasons for his
conviction of the, guilt of Dreyfus. He
declared there was no charge against
Esterhazy, with the exception of the re
semblance of his handwriting to that of
the bordereau. Moreover, the witness
added, there had been a new fact since
the judgment of the Court of Cassation,'
namely Esterhazy's confession that he
wrote the bordereau. But, added, Es
terhazy advanced and withdrew his con.
fesslon intermittently. If Esterhazy had
rendered services to the intelligence de
partment there would have been traces
of them in the cash book. But no money
had been paid Esterhazy, though even
supposing ho worked out of pure benevo
lence he would have been paid. Yet there
was no trace of such payments. Ester
hazy had said he wrote the bordereau un
der the orders of Colonel Sandherr.
"But," declared General Itoget, "I, who
knew Colonel Sandherr well, declare It Is
false, j Colonel Sanclherr was absolutely
Incapable of such an order. I add that it
is inadmissible., because Colonel Sandherr
was' the last person to know of the ex
istence of the bordereau, which was re
ceived In the ordinary way. This bor
dereau was handed to Colonel Henry and
was brought by him to the intelligence
department It was. shown to others by
Colonel. Henry after he had pieced it to
gether: Colonel Sandherr only saw it
later. ' â :'
"Esterhazy has also Bald the document
was stolen from an embassy and brought
by a porter. It Is false to say the intel
ligence department ever had any relations
with a porter of that embassy. It is pos
sible Esterhazy is preparing some sur
prises for us between now and the end
of the trial. They won't disturb me any
more than other surprises."
Referring to- the Question of the com
plicity of Henry ana Esterhazy, the wit
ness said: "If Henry had been the ac
compliceAof Esterhazy, how can it be ad
mitted that ho himself brought the bor
dereau, which might have caused him to
be suspected, to the Intelligence depart
ment? ' â¢ â 
." General Roget* spoke for three hours
without adducing any new facts, only re-
Iterating in the most forcible terms what
has been bandied about In the antl-Drey
fusard press for a year past. The most
interesting part of his testimony was ins
attack on Colonel Piequart. which will
undoubtedly lead to the confrontation of
the two men. Ho treated Dreyfus with
out mercy, both in words and attitude.
In. fact. it .seemed at times as though he
would nrovoke the prisoner, into striking
him. The- general's manner was most
passionate. In his outburst at the end
of. his testimony he uttered the most
ruthless attacks with the air of one do
livering : a ' pleasant Sunday-school ad
dress,, leaning over the front of the wit
ness rail, sipping from a glass of water,
wiping- his lips and mopping his brow
with perfect self-satisfaction. But agam
and again he would half-turn in his chair
and. pointing his finger at Dreyfus, .would
repeat some cruel accusation, at the same
time fixing- his eyes on the prisoner, his
head' â  inclined . forward like that of a
cobra waiting the moment to strike.
Dreyfus was not affected and steadily re
turned his gaze, sometimes throwing a
glance at : the president of the court, as
though appealing for permission to reply.
Once, when General Roget had flung one
of these darts, he stopped and deliberate
ly, paused. One could see the fire in
Dreyfus' eyes and in his tightly clcnclfed
jaws could be divined the struggle that
was going on within him. The captain or
gendarmes, seated ' beside. Dreyfus,
â watched him closely. The seconds passed
like hours and the spectators held their
breaths: ' General Roget seemed' pur
< posely, to prolong the silence in order to
make a deeper impression. .It was a.
I perilous moment, but Dreyfus won ' th?
j battle over, his passions and when Roget'S
voice was at length heard again every
one' knew the dancer was passed and a
deep-drawn sigh 'of relief came from the
audience. :'. ~ .
The general discoursed lengthily on the
famous 'scene with' Colonel Henry in the
office of M. Bertulus, the examining mag
istrate, and said M. Bertulus asked Henry
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 17, 1899.
RUN OF THE SHERMAN
TOWARD SAN FRANCISCO
THE transport Sherman may get in here sooner than expected. All the' transports coming here from Nagasaki:,:
have been supplied at that point with Japanese coal, and as It Is not near so good a eteam coal as Austra- V.
Han or Cardiff, slower time was made in consequence. The Government, however, secured a lot of Cumber-, ij
land coal, the finest steam coal in the market, and the bunkers of the Sherman and Warren were both filled. .
with it at Nagasaki. As a result the Warren made the run In record time for her, and it Is safe to say that
the Sherman will follow suit. The officers of the Warren think the Sherman should get here the night of the 23d
or midday on the 24th. . . ' . ..
J. T. McMillan, United States nautical 'expert, figures that at noon yesterday (San Francisco time) the Sher
man was in latitude 40 degrees 50 minutes north, longitude 170 degrees 50 minutes west. She would, therefore, be. :
about 2400 nautical miles from San Francisco. :"
A large copy of the above map showing the course of the transport is on exhibition in the window on the Market
street side of the business office of The Call. The map is attracting a great deal of attention, and crowds are gath
ered about the window to view it from curly morning till late at night. . '
to inform the witness that he, M. Ber
tulus. was a friend of the army, and
begged the witness to call and see how
he would communicate the result of his
conversations into blanche and "aper
anza" forgeries.
"In reply," said! General Roget, "I said:
'When you see M. Bertulus you will thank
him in my behalf. Tell him the investiga
tion does not interest me in any way. I
adder! that I was rather distrustful ot this
proposal, which, I pointed out, was per
haps a trap." . I
The court next dwelt on the seizure ot ;
papers at the house of Madame Pays, on.
which M. Bertulus largely founded his
conviction of the guilt of Henry, owing
to the mention in them of the name of a j
spy. "Richard," at Cuers and Basle, where
ii 'was well known spies were In the habit
r.f meeting. Then the general tried to re
fute M. Bertulus 1 statements, declaring
that Henry brought three of these -docu
ments t.i the War Department and that
they did not contain the mention of Basle
or Cuers, as stated by M. Bertulus. The
latter, however, has already shown before:
the whole Court of Cassation that while
he was mistaken in saying the words ap
peared in those documents, they did not
appear in other papers seized at Madame j
Pays' residence.
General R<:Â«et. who was becoming more
and more excited, frequently wiped per- :
Spiratlon from his brow and moistened his
lips with water. At this point the gen-;
eral thought H desirable to make a plecla
ration that he did riot ileslre it to be said.
that he questioned the good faith of some I
wltru BseS who had Ut-en heard. He added;
"1 make this statement so that there
shall be no misunderstanding and in order
that my words may not be misinterpreted.
Nevertheless their testimony is open to
criticism, even as our utterances are i-ritl-
Continulng. the witness said: "M. Caai
mlr-Perier deposed before the Court of
Cassation that an embassador called to I
make official denial of the statement that;
important documents were found at his ,
embassy. The Embassador, however,
knew it was a fact But admitting that
he did not know it. there is nothing sur
prising in the occurrence; In view of the:
facility with which attache A (don't men- I
tlon his name, as the Minister has for- ,
bidden it) allowed compromising letters to !
lie around. I read one such letter which I
was very compromising to a person whose i
name I "cannot mention. Why. therefore.
should not the bordereau go astray?"
The general Insisted upon the truth Of
the statement that military attaches "A"
and "B." under which Utters he referred,
to Colonel Schwartzkoppen of the Ger
man embassy at Paris and Major Pani*
zardi of the Italian embassy at the French
capital at the time, worked together al
most dally, nn<\ be quote. 1 a passage from
a letter exchanged between them, as fol- .
lows- "M. Hanotaux, the sly fellow, is;
glad that the embassy is denying. The
embassy must deny." |
In the same document, declared General '
Roget was a name written, and the j
name, he asserted, was that of Dreyfus, i
The name of Esterhazy. he added, was I
not found in any of the documents, none
of which could be ascribed to him, with
the exception of the Petit Bleu, which |
Colonel Picquart discovered in such an j
extraordinary manner.
The witness then said he felt great un
easiness in regard to the document con
taining the words "Cette canaille de ;
Dâ " A certain military attach,-, said the;
fencral later on In his testimony, In- !
ormed Colonel Sandherr that there was
some one who imitated his handwriting
perfectly. The name of Dubois, the wit
ness said, was in the correspondence of
the military attache. Colonel Dubois. the I
general explained, was an "unfortunate I
officer. " who futilely tried to sell the se
cret of the smokeless powder used in the j
French army.
"If," said General Roget, "no other per- !
Bon i'^^ be found to whom the Initial 'D' ;
can apply, to whom does it then apply?" ,
\=; lie 'made this remark the witness
faced about and looked fixedly at the j
prisoner, who. however, merely shrugged
his should, is.
">Â«"ow." continued the general, "the ex
planations furnished on this point by M. ;
Trarieux (former Minister of Justice)
troubled me somewhat, but 1 don't ln-
Here General Ro,?et paused, the excite
ment under which he was laboring being
almost uncontrollable. In a thick, chok
ing voice he continued: "And yet, in the
presence of disinterested testimony like
mine you will not allow preference to be |
shown to the evidence of persons who
have benefited by treason."
At this point the general broke down ;
and tears streamed down his cheeks. \
Resuming his testimony, the general set I
to work in his effort to prove the guilt
of Dreyfus. He declared there were |
traces of treason in every paragraph of ;
the bordereau, and that Dreyfus alone not
Esterhazy could have been acquainted
with the "plans it contained. He criticised
the deposition of Major Hartmann of tho
Twenty-second Artillery in regard to this
The witness then traversed the old
ground trying to prove that Dreyfus
alone was aware of the secrets of the
new artillery guns, of the plans for the
concentration of troops and the contents 1
of the firing manual. He then endeavored'!
to show that Colonel Picquart had re
coursa to fraudulent methods, with tho |

the Century.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 16.â Miners Mho reached here this morning
by the steamer Dirigo bring news of the finding of a strange lake,
about a quarter of a mile wide, a few miles from the canyon of the
White Horse.
The water of tho lake is lukewarm, and strange to say, considering
that it is so far from salt water, as bitter as any gait water.
The miners, after investigating the stories of the Indians of that vi
cinity in reference to their find, believe the lake lies in the crater of an
extinct volcano. That the volcano was active within the last century
at least is evidenced by the many stories told to the miners by the In
dians, whose, traditions tell oi a time not long ago when flre belched
from the mountain.
intent of incriminating some one other
than Dreyfus, and declared Picquart
spent 100,000 francs with the object of
organizing a campaign of surveillance of
"an unfortunate uiflcer who was guilt
less." This 100,000 francs, he added, was
a reserve accumulated by Colonel Sand
herr, by strict economy, from the funds
at the disposal of the War Office. This
reserve had entirely disappeared.
In response tv gestures of contradiction
from M. Demange, General Roget ad
mitted the, figures quoted were perhaps
exaggerated. The witness next accused
Colonel Picquart of suppressing Ujcu
ments tending to compromise Dreyfus.
As the gt neral was evidently greatly
fatigued. T'olonel Jouaust suggested that
he continue his testimony to-morrow.
The colonel then addressed the prisoner,
asking him if he had anything to say in
reply to General Roget. Dreyfus replied:
"tfo. my colonel. It Is frightful that
day after day, for hours, I should thus
have my heart, my soul and my very en
trails torn without being permitted to re
ply. It is ft terrible torture to Impose
upon an Innocent and loyal soldier. It Is
a frightful thing! Frightful! Frightful!"
This outburst caused a great sensa
tion. The audience, profoundly stirred,
began to applaud, but the applause was
quickly suppressed.
Colonel Jouaust pointed out to Dreyfus
that he had been given an opportunity to
speak at the end of every deposition and
that tho court would continue to do so.
The court then adjourned.
M. LABORI SUFFERS
MUCH. BUT IS CHEERFUL
RBNNBS, Aug. If..â The folloA-ing bul
letin fras Issued to-night by M. Laborl'a
four physicians: "The condition of the
patient is satisfactory, in spite of slight
(ever. The X ray has shown the bullet
traversed the skin, sub-cutaneous ctllu
lar tissue and muscles around the spinal
column, flattening against the right side
of the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra."
M. Mathieu Dreyfus, brother of Captain
Dreyfus, visited the wounded man this
rooming. Finding him to be progressing
favorably, M. Dreyfus said, "Well, mon
brave; the revolver did not seem to have
done you much harm."
'â¢Oh'," replied M. I^abori, smiling, "re
volvers are no use against me. 1 am too
big. It needs v cannon shot to do me
much harm." - Â
This is a striking illustration of M.
Labort's pluck and cheerfulness in spite
Ml' the agony he is undergoing.
The Premier, M. WaldecK-Rousseau, has
telegraphed to the sufferer his sincere
grief and hopes of his recovery.
Kmil Zola has telegraphed, saying:
"On learning of the outrage I send you
the expression of my Indignant anger. My
h.-art is full of tenderness und admiration
for you."
M. Monard, who represented Mme.
Dreyfus in the revision proceedings be
fore the Court of Cassation, has been
summoned to replace Maitre Labor! until
the latter is able to return to his post. M.
Monard is expected to appeac in court to
morrow.
To-night it is understood that Maitre.
Demange. will to-morrow repeat the ap
plication for an adjournment In conse
quence of a hint that the Government
commissary, Major <"arrie,re, has received
instructions not to oppose it.
RBNNBS. Aug. 17.â Dr. Paul Rectus
says that Maltr* I^jbori was weaker yes
terday and suffered much pain. The phy
sicians have not yet extracted the bullet,
and they do not believe that Labori can
attend court Monday. They say that it
would be an act of great imprudence if
he were to do Â«o.
Maitre I-aborl is slightly worse this
morning. Hi? fever continues to increase.

FARMERS TO OWN
A NEW RAILROAD
Will Build the Stockton-
Sacramento Line.
PLANS OF THE PROJECTORS
SEEK A BETTER OUTLET FOR
THEIR PRO DUCK
Santa Fe Is Not Interested in the
Venture, Though the Road May
Be Sold After Its Com
pletion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Aug. 16.â A Surveying
party under Engineer Compton, who is to
make the preliminary survey for a .new
railroad between Stockton and Sacra
mento, will start out next week. It -is
said on reliable authority that up to date
the- Santa Fe people know nothing about
the plans of the projectors, and that, in.
the event of the road being built, no one
will have any preferred influence in.- .its
policy. Arthur Thornton of New Hope
is said to be amons several Wealthy
farmers who are interested in the enter-'
prise. -
"I have just this much to say;" gala ah
interested person to-day, M th'e . line -will
surely be built and by a company 'upon
which the Santa Fe has no strings'. . Th*
farmers along the line are interested and
many along the proposed route who havo
been Interviewed have pledged rights af
way without cost. As soon as the line ia
definitely established the company will
organize in regular corporate form."
lhe Inference from this gentleman's
talk was that farmers along the line were
the real movers In the enterprise and that
the road from Sacramento to tidewater
here is being built to further their inter
ests as shippers, rather than to extend
any other system. Tho same gentleman
said, however, that no land guarantees
would be given that the line would al
ways be maintained as an independent
one. It might be sold if any company
wished to pay enough for it and give the
shippers along the route sufficient assur
ance that their Interests would not suffer.
Sufficient money has already been sub
scribed to carry on preliminary work and
every move has been made in a business
like manner.

BIG RATTLESNAKE
Crawled Out of a Sewer and. Terror
ized a Temperance Town.
John Newton and Alexis Yeager, two
young ranchers of Augustus, near -here,
had "an encounter ' this morning with a
huge snake, which had for hours terror
ized'the people in' the business section of
t"he town. .'
'The snake was first seen when it was
wiggling its way from a sewer trap, it
having forced the huge iron cap from its
setting. â  The business men fled to their
stores, locking the doors, and "securing
funs' and â  crowbars and other weapons,
before venturing out. â  The local druggist
declares the snake to have been twenty
feet In length and as large in diameter
as ordinary fire hose. .
Several shots were fired at it as it
crawled .along: between the car tracks,
and one stray bullet killed a horse tied
to a barber's pole. 'â  â¢
The snake, on. the approach of a street
car, coiled, itself into a cone-like shape
and struck at the car, frightening the
horses, which in turn ran away with the
car -full of passengers; . Fortunately the
horses were soon caught and no one was
hurt. 'â ' â â /.â â â¢ >â -:* -.-"â  -:. ;â  V;â  %-i ,
"-. Newton and â  Yeager, two cowboys, rode
into ; town, and -were almost upon the rep
tile ' before discovering it. They : pulled
their guns, and, mounted on their -horses,
began to pour lead on the snake. The lat
ter did not present a good target; and- the.
men dismounted and fought it on foot.'
Twice - the j snake' made a . spring, sending
its fangs into the bared arms of the men,
who; however/.' pluckily continued the
light until the snake gave up the struggle.
< It was found to be a rattler of un
usual size. -Thirty shots took effect be
fore the snake died. Augusta is a temper

PULLMAN HEIRS PAY
THEIR INHERITANCE TAX
Attack Against the New Illinois
Statute Fails on All Points
Involved.
CHICAGO, Aug. 16.â A check for $153,
--252 04, signed by Norman B. Ream and
Robert T. Lincoln, executors of the estate
of George M. Pullman, was paid Into the
County <"ourt this afternoon to cancel a
Lgainst the estate established hy the
inheritance tax law. This is the largest
tax "f Its kind paid in Illinois since the
passage of the law several years ag>>. The
next largest was that on the estate of
A. A. Munger, amounting to about $63,000.
The tax in the Pullman case was not
paid without a strong legal tight by the
h.!rs Eminent counsel were retained and
for weeks before Judge Carter of the
County Court they argued new points in
the,|r attacks on th<? law. The validity of
the measure wa-s denied on account of
numerous alleged defects in the wording.
Intent and manner of passage of the
measure.
Every position taken by the attorneys
for the heirs wai= met by the County At
torney, and when all had been heard
.Judge Carter took the matter under ad
visement for several weeks. At the end
of that time he rendered a decision up
holding the law and ordering the payment
of the taxes. The Pullman beneficiaries
announced they would take an appeal to
the highest courts. The principal point
of law 6u which the attack was made waa
en the right to tax the widow's dower.
l'j>t>n reflection, however, they seem to
have regarded their case as hopeless and
to-day settled the claim.
REVERSED THE ENGINES
AND JUMPED FOR LIFE
Head-On Collision of Two Freight
Trains Barely Averted Near
Benicia.
BUISUN, Aug. It;.â What might have
proved a disastrous train wreck was
averted early this morning at Armory
Point, a short distance north of Benicia.
A special freight train westward bound
and timed to arrive at Suisun at 2
o'clock a. m. had orders at Elmira to
meet an eastern bound freight train at
Benicia. This order was afterward
. banged and Charles Vose, the nisht
operator at Suisun received orders for
the western bound freight train to meet
the other freight train at G9o4yeax sta
tion instead of Benicia. Goody, ar is lo
cated halfway between Suisun and
Benicia,
Voi*o failed to grlve thp order on the
nrrival of the train at Suisun. The con
ductor pulled out, thinking the place nf
meeting was Benicia. On reaching
â \rniory Point the engineers of the trains
Observed one another's lights and in
stantly realized their danger. The
engines were reversed, the a.ir brakes ap
plied and the engineers and firemen
jumped. The locomotives stopped within
ii few feet of each other.
Vose Bays lie forgot to deliver the order,
and, realising his grave mistake, at once
telegraphed his resignation to the com
pany.

MANILA. Aug. 17.â 8 a. m.â
The Twelfth Infantry left Calu
lut at sunrise to-day and ad
vanced up the railway. Captain
Evans" battalion deployed to the
right of th<> track and Captain
Woods' to the left. Two com
panies remained on the track
with the artillery. The insur
gents were found intrenched in
front of the town, the trenches
having been dug within a few
days and since the occupation of
Calulut.
At a distance of 1500 yards the
Filipinos opened fire. Their
force was estimated by Colonel
Smith at 1500, although the resi
dents afterward said it exceeded
those figures by a thousand.
The enemy sent heavy volleys
against the whole American
line. Most of their shooting, as
usual, was high, but they con
centrated their heaviest fire
down the track upon the artil
lery.
Colonel Smith kept the whole
line moving rapidly, with fre
quent rushes. The insurgents
attempted to flank Captain
Evans and therefore two com
panies were sent to the right
and drove them back. Unable
to stand our continuous volleys
the Filipinos abandoned the
trenches and retreated through
the town northward. It ap
pears that they had only re
ceived their supply of ammuni
tion this morning. Had they
been attacked sooner they could
have made little resistance.
The intense heat caused much
suffering among the Americans.
A reporter of the 'Manila Times
who was accompanying Colonel
Smith was shot in the head.
One officer received a slight
wound in the face.
MANILA, Aug. 16â5:20 p. m.â Th*

WASHINGTON. Aug. 16.â The sharp
engagement between Mac Arthur's
command and the insurgents was re
ported to the War Department in the
following dispatch from General Otis:
MANILA, Aug. 16.â Adjutant General,
Washington: Mac Arthur's troops occupy
the country from Candalla to a point near
Angeles, thence toward Porac, taking
within his line Santa Arita, Guagua and
Hacolor. Colonel Smith with ten com

WILL CHARTER FOUR
ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.â Secretary
Root has been In consultation with the
officers of the Quartermaster's department
with a view to expediting the movement
of the Philippine reinforcements, and aa
a result, he, this afternoon, directed that
four additional transports be chartered
They are the Pueblo, Belgian King'
Columbia and Charles F. Nelson. These
four ships have a capacity of 2550 men.
The Pueblo Is now at San Francisco and
the Columbia at Portland. The other
two vessels are expected to arrive at San
Francisco in about ten days, and it is ex
pected that all of them will he ready to
sail for Manila by September 10.
It is Secretary Root's desire that the
entire body of the reinforcements for
General Otis' ;irmy may reach the Philip
pines for service during the month of
October at the latest, and to that end he
has been quietly negotiating (or addi
tional ships. It Is now believed that all
of the ten regiments will have landed at
Manila by the time the dry season opens.
A short and successful campaign of this
new army would, of course, obviate the
necessity of sending any additional volun
teers to the Philippines, and the plans un
der consideration at the War Depart
ment are said to be predicted on that
Idea, it being the intention that whatever
troops may be recruited will be held In
reserve for possible contingencies.

food will be consumed every day by the
men in the Philippines some idea can bo
gained of the quantities which will have to
be provided.
The first order for the new army of
50,000 men has been made up by Commis
sary General Weston. This Is only prelim
inary, and similar orders will follow, so
there will be no Intermission in the sup

Is Sent to Jail... . â ,â>'""
PORT TOWNSEND, Aug. IG.â Albert
Lewis, mate of the bark Hesper, who
arrived here from Shanghai on the
schooner Prosper, reports that when the
Hesper's cargo was discharged at Tslntau
her crew refused to return, though they
had signed for the round trip. Thefe be
ing no American Consul at Tslntau, Cap
tain Sodergreen applied to the command
er of a German warship, who ordered the
crew sent to jail. Mate Lewis says the
only authority recognized at Tsintau is
that of the Germans. With a pick-up
crew the Hesper sailed for Puget Sound
July 20 and is now due. "
The cause given by Mate Lewis for the
Hesper'V; crew refusing to return is cruel

OUR OWN COUNTRYMEN IN PERIL.
While we are not as excitable as the
average Frenchman we are more prone
to neglect trivial and even important
affairs. This matter of negligence does
not apply as much to national or busi-
ness affairs as to those of health.
There are countless numbers of men
in all walks of life throughout the Uni-
ted States who are physically inca-
pacitated. Some are overworked, some
are worried, some are suffering from
youthful follies and excesses in after
life, while others have a contracted ail-
ment or a chronic disease which is em-
barrassing, painful and dangerous.
Dr. Meyers & Co. are giving health
and strength to such men, many
of them every day.
These noted specialists have devoted
more than eighteen years to the study
of all ailments of men. Their staff iÂ»
composed of physicians and surgeons
of the highest standing, graduates
from the best schools and hospitals of
both America and Europe.

tion or advice, and furnish without cost
to the patient all the remedies, appli-
ances, etc., necessary, to -effect a quick
and permanent cure.
As a guarantee Dr. Meyers & Co. will

cure in any bank in San Francisco, to
be paid to Dr. Meyers & Co. after he is
entirely well. If it is not convenient to

Howard. Â£l who they claim is a brother of
Augustus Howard/ right name Charles
Vivian ' Doyle, now a fugitive from San
Francisco justice. They picture him as
the bad brother, through whom "Augustus
Howard"-. has come into trouble. The po
lice lure admit that "Augustus Howard"
has. a bad. brother, who is known to the
thiefrchasers ii the Antipodes as "Bris
bane" -Doyle, which surname tallies with
â  i,.ii of Charles Vivian" Doyle. Chief Lees
is .of the opinion, thai "Brisbane" Doyle is
in' prison in Apia, Samoa, at ;the present
time. â¢:...â¢:â¢â¢ââ . â¢â¢; .. â  'â "â .. >.
'-'..Shortly"- after the man then known as
Augustus: ." Howard broached the shale
lama d^ajl'to Green in this city it was
agreed between Green and Howard that
trie Au&tralian who has since developed
so many aliases should accompany a Mr.
Kelly, Green's brother-in-law, to the
lands, where he proposed to make an in
vestigation. Kelly and his wife, Howard
and his wife am! child and the governess
took passage for Australia. Arrived at
Apia, in the Samoan group, Howard, his
wife and the governess took a carriage
and drove about the town, finally bringing
up close to'the prison there. Just before
they got to the prison the governess over
heard Howard say to his wife: "I must
go and .see him. He may be able to tell
me something about those diamonds."
Howard got out and went Into the
prison, leaving his wife and the governess
who sat in the carriage until they heard
the steamer whistle blow. They turned
the horses' heads and were becoming very
impatient at the non-appearance of the
husband*, who came out at last, after the
whistle had given three or four warnings.
He was breathless when he reached the
carriage. The man he went to Bee and for
whom he nearly missed his steamer was
"Brisbane" Doyle, alias Burton Howard.
That was not the only odd thing
Howard did on that trip. His actions at
Sydney do not beer out the statements, r
however true they may be, of Mrs.
Howard and Attorney Heatty. that the;
mat; of many aliases was In no fear of
results at that city. Kelly reported to <
his brother-in-law, Green, that Howard
absolutely refused to go out In the day- â 
time, giving as an excuse that he was ;
afraid they would steal his patents. In
the end Howard suddenly leftâ it was
afterward understood for Adelaide â leav- !
Ing Kelly stranded and none the wiser as
to the shale lands.
Thr detectives now hunting for Howard.
or Doyle, contradict th<> statements of
Mrs. Howard regarding her marriage to !
thÂ« "plunger." They say that she was
the wife of another when she met Doyle
and the mother of a little girl: that she j
elooed with the newcomer, taking her I
little daughter from her home and placing
her in the care of a family at Sydney
known as Cook.
They did not see the little one till seven
or eight years had passed, when they re
turned, disguised in rags, presumably to
escape detection, and took the girl, then
known a.< Kva Cook, with them. Further,
the detectives say that Mrs. Howard,
when on the witness stand at Alameda.
In th<> suit brought against herself a-nd
husband by Mrs. Ahpol, was asked the
question whether nr not she was the wife
of the missing man. She refused to an
swer. This is a matter of record, whether
or not the other statements made by the
police .-.rv authentic.
The police point out also that the story
told by Howard's wife of his wealth and
position la disproved by the statements
made by Charles Clausen, a convict. In his
efforts to obtain a pardon. According to
these, Howard was often in sore straits
on account of lack of funds and was fre
quently compelled to pawn the clothing
"t ),is wife and self to buy the necessaries
of life.
ClaUÃen Is now serving a two and a half
years' term in San Quentin for receiving
goods. He charges Howard with
WB ingratitude. He alleges that when
Howard arrived in. this city five or six
yesN ago he was without funds, and in
order to secure the wherewith to buy food
and lodging for his family he visited the
North Knd loan office, Sacramento and
Kearny streets, and pawned Tils wife's
ana his own clothing. He did this on nu
merous occasions, and as a result of his
visits to the pawn shop made the ac
quaintance of Clauses, who was employed
there as a clerk. Howard succeeded in

CHARLES CLAUSSEN, NOW AT SAN QUENTIN.
Claussen claims to have been railroaded to prison by Doyle, alias Howard,
whom ho befriended when penniless In this city.
Interesting Clausen in his acetylene gas
inventions to the extent of advancing
money out of his salary for purpose* of
experimenting and buying material. Ac
cording to Clausen, he and Howard en
tered into a partnership and attempted to
foist the invention on the market. .
About that time Howard interested a
number of wealthy, men in his invention,
and as they showed a desire to invest
money in the scheme Howard drew away
from his partner and finally ignored him
entirely. Although he was making a for
tune with the Invention Clausen was
vitally interested in, Howard did not
share with his partner. In fact, he abso
lutely refused to aid Clausen out of the
trouble he grot in by receiving, stolen
goods. Friends of Clausen now say that
WHERE MURPHY STOLE KEYS
CjK? Is DREW SPTEGI, is the propri-
ANDREW the little shop on Pacific
etor of the Uttlp shop on Pacific
/~~\ street, near East, where Murphy,
If \), one of the thugs hired by Howard
to do away with Millionaire
Green, went to buy the Yale keys 'to
open the specie boxes stored In the
strong room of the steamship Ala
meda. Spiegl reported the robbery to
the police, but little attention was
paid to It at the time.
' Spiegl was taken to the dock on the
arrival of the steamships China and
Australia in the hope that he might
identify the man who visited him, but
without success.
Spiegl's place of business is at 31
Pacific street. He occupies a small
portion of the building as a dwelling
and second-hand store. In the window
were the bunches of keys that attract
ed Murphy's attention, and having
â¢bought a few and needing the entire
bunch, the following night he cut a
hole in the window and extracted it.
The opfcnlng through which he stole
the keys is still visible. An extra
piece of glass has been pasted over
the hole to prevent other nands from
carrying off the. contents of the win
dow.
Howard used his money nnd evil Influ
ence to send the unfortunate Clausen l>>

him some bother by his importunities fur

On top of these stories concerning How
ard, the detectives have been running
down his connections in town and have
unearthed any Dumber of people who will
he interesting witnesses when the fugitive
is apprehended. Three of them may know
more than they want to tell. These three
are Robert Creelman, known to every fre
quenter of the r&cetradu as "Nigger
F'm.i." Eddie KaufTman and George Ad
amw. Creelman, who Is not supposed to
have made as much money out of Howard
as the other two, appears to be .sticking
cloÃest to him in his adversityâ so close.
In fact, that he, too, has been missing
from bis usual haunts since Friday last,
and is now supposed to be in hiding with
the "plunger."
Eddie Kauffman acted as commissioner
at the racetrack for Howard and was his
principal witness in the Foster-McKe^ver
controversy for the possession of the
rne.ehorse Yellow Tail. He was the man,
using the Yellow Tail litigation as a
pretext, who served the fictitious warrant
on Howard the night of March 82 last, en
abling that manipulator to make a plaus
ible excuse to Green for not accompany
ing him on the voyage.
Adams, besides spreading broadcast the
rumor that Green had hired thugs to do
away with Howard, is said to be deep In
his secrets and will be put to much stres.s
to deny them to the police.
ROMANCE OF OHIO GOVERNORS.
How Several Noted Men of the Buck- !
eye State in the Past Wooed I
.-'. and Waited and Won or Lost
William Allen was a handsome man in
youth, and he was much admired ny the |
young women of the Scio^d Valley. To
.their surprise he remained unmarried until
he Was regarded as a confirmed bachelor.
When he lirst entered politics he fell in
love with Effle McArthur, ! the lovely
daughter of Governor Duncan Â».-cArthur. |
The sturdy old Scotchman did not.be
llev.- In young- Allen. They did not agree
in politics. Th" doughty Governor was so
enraged at Allen's ' wooing that he for
bade him the house.
In revenge Allen ran for Congress
against Arthur and beat him by one
vote.
This broke the old man's heart and
made Allen's wooing altogether an im
possibility. Allen went to Congress and
Effle married a Mr. Coons of Kentucky.
William Allen ceased attentions at the
shrine of Love arid gave up his life to
ambition.
His nephew, Allen G. Thurman, not
many years younger- than the distin
guished uncle, also had a disappointment
in love. He wanted to marry Mary Dun,
daughter of .a rich farmer. There .wore
objections, possibly because young, Thur
man was poor, but he waited patiently,
saw Mary Dun marry Gwynne ToÂ»npkins
of Kentucky and still the Thurman faith
failed not. in a few years Allen Thur
man was a rising lawyer and Mary Dun
Tompkins was a young widow.
The young lawyer proposed again and
they were wedded in Kentucky. William
Allen went to his nephew's wedding.
There he met Eflie McArthur, his first and
only love. She â  was a widow with one
daughter, still young and still beautiful.
After the years of separation they found
their love for each other renewed, and
shortly after the 'marriage of Allen G.
Thurman, his uncle, William Allen, and
the daughter of Duncan McArthur were
married. In the language of the story
book, "They lived happily ever ..after
ward."
Mrs. Allen was with her husband In
Washington while he was Senator. There
phe died. Jt was before the days of rail
roads, and Senrftor Allen, obeying her
dying wish, brought her body to Ohio that
It might rest beside those of her blood on
the banks of the Scioto.
The coffin was placed In a wagon and
brought slowly over the mountains. Day
by day he followed that dear dead clay
through the woods and across the streams
on horseback, watching faithfully every
minute lest harm should come to the dead.
.Think of that lonely ride and the long
nights of vigil! There is no finer story of
pathetic patience in the history of our
State.
With the death of his wife William Al
len lost ambition for politics. He retired
to Fruit Hillâ her father's homeâ a home
to which he was once denied admission
and lived In seclusion until drawn into the
, campaign 'of is;:;, when he- was elected
i Governor. When be died, in 1879, he was
1 buried by his wife's side, and near the
grave of Duncan McArthur, his foe for
i life, but the rather of the woman he loved.
No less splendid and beautiful was the
i married life of William Allen's nephew
Allen G. Thurman. Mrs. Thurman was
ever watchful of her husband, and he
never wanted to make a Journey without
he.r company. He used to joke about her
! watchful worry about him, but' he appre
| ciated It all, and their marriage existence
! was ideal. ; â  â - â 
William MedlU was the only bachelor
Governor of the State. He died In Lan
| caster at the close of the war, an old
] man full of honors. Early In his career
j he was in love with a beautiful young
I woman of Lancaster. His wooing was ar
dent but unsuccessful. Possibly she did
not expect any great future for the young
lawyer, and probably she did not care for
future fame as balanced with present
love. She refused him and married an
other. Medill vowed that he would never
! marry. He kept his word and flung him
i self into the lists to do battle for tame
and wealth. The woman he loved, lived
in Lancaster. The rejected lover saw her
day by day as he went upward in the es
teem of . his fellow men. , She saw him go
to Congress, and saw him Governor of tne
State. Her husband died, and Medill
was a mourner at the funeral of his uead
rival, and condoled with true manly sym
pathy with the widow. Medill was a
courtly, graceful gentleman of the old
school. When the one woman he haa
loved was a widow of several months tno
old statesman would maÃe a formal call
at her home once a week on a certain
day. Every one in Lancaster who knew
of the romance thought quite naturally
| that In good time Governor Medill would
: wed the woman who . had years before
refused him. His frequent and formal
calls gave color to this belief, but he
never mentioned marriage.
It was a delicious sight 'for the gossips
of Lancaster to see the stately old man
â¢â  arrayed in his best, make his weekly call'
He was almost dandified, even In his old
days, and was a striking, long remem
bered figure in Lancaster streets. . He was
a rich man, too, and the woman of his
! early love was left in straitened circum
-1 stances. When Governor Medill died in
j ISGS it was thought that he would leave
some substantial legacy to the widow, but
again he disappointed '. the gossips, and
his property went to a distant relative.
The widow lived serenely, evincing no re-
I gret that he did not propose marriage or
remember her In his will. The old Gov
ernor is burled In the Lancaster ceme
tery near the father and mother of John
Sherman, and not far from the tomb of
Thomas Ewing, and in the same cemetery,
| sleeps the woman for love of whom he re
i mained single all his life.
Governor Salmon P. Chase, who sleeps

i was not without romance In his career. -
He came to Cincinnati as a young man
blessed with an aristocratic- lineage and
an immediate entry into the fashionable
i circle â¢ which I had its headquarters in the
! Fourth and Pike streets, locality. He met
! Miss Kitty Garniss, a famous beauty and
J fashionable belle of that period. It was

in the early '.Ws. They were often thrown
into each other's society, but neither
thought seriously of the other until they
both lit came boarders at the Pearl Street
Hotel. Chase had been sick, and it was
during his convalescence that Kitty Gar
niss appealed to his heart.
fene was kind and sympathetic to the
young lawyer and eheerea up his lonely
hours of recovery. One day he wrote
these lines upon a card and gave it to her:
Young love presided o'er thy birth
And named thee then ihe queen of mirth.
That was the beginning of their court
ship, and marriage soon followed. Young
Chase was then rather awkward, and his
bride apologized for him. saying: "He is
uncouth but wait until I polish him up.
Those who knew the polished, aristo
cratic, superb Chase in later life can hard
ly Lmagine that h. was ever awkward or
uncouth at any time in his life. Alas,
that the vivacious Kitty Garniss did not
live to see her husband "polished up.
She died not long after the marriage, and
Boon after the 1 Irth of his daughter.
Mrs Chase died while her husband was
in Philadelphia. He didn't learn of her
death until h.- reached pittsburg on his
way hum.-. Then a letter reached him,
and his grief was great. There were no
railroad's or telegraph in those days, and
the stricken husband came home by
steamboal down the Ohio River. His long.
slow ride was like the fong journey of
William Allenâ long nights and days of
sorrowful remembrance In Cincinnati
he found thai her body had been em
balrhed and tfte funeral delayed for his
coming. For two days he sat alone with
the dead wife praying and kissing ber
dead lips as if to bring her back to lift .
For years he visited her grave every
day The child was called Kilty for her
mother but was soon called to heaven. A
few years later Salmon P. Chase married
Ann Eliza Foncet of Cincinnati, bhe was
the mother pf Kate chase Sprague, who
has had a high, proud place in modern
history and society. She was named
Catherine for the child that was dead, but
was i ever given the pet family name of
When Kate Chase was born her father
wrote of her in his diary: "The babe is
called pretty, but I think otherwise 'âa
comment that was a bit ungracious, con
sidering Kate Chase's subsequent beauty.
Her mother died young, and Governor
Chase married a third time. His last wife
was Sarah Bella LudWw. whose grand
father was the founder of Cincinnati. All
three wives of Governor Chase are buried
In Spring Grove by the side of their dis
tinguished husband.
The late President Hayes waf a matter
of-fact, practical man, but he had a bit
of the romantic in his soul. He was first
attracted to his wife by Her merry, ring
ing 'augh. He was at Delaware on a va
cation and one night, visiting the old
Sulphur Pprlng, heard in the darkness the
ripple ana peal of musical laughter. "1
want to know the girl who can laugh like
that ' said the future President. "A wom
an who laughs so cheerily would make a
man happy for life."
In a few moments the laughing school
girl, Lucy Webb, was presented to the
blue-^ved collegian, Rud Hayes, and that
was tfie beginning of an affection which
ended only when both were laid away in
the emetery at Fremont.â Cincinnati En

Tried to Tip the Porter.
Washington Post.
A pood story is told by the Denver con
tingent in this city on one of their number
who got rich suddenly by a lucky strike
In the mines. This ready-made Croesus
had never ridden In a Pullman car, but I
he> had heard all about the avaricious
porter and his capacity for tips. He rolled
Into his berth on his journey with his
pockets creaking with greenbacks and his
trousers laden with silver dollars. Along
about dawn he was wakened by the
porter, who had held out his hand and
Bald something about wanting a check.
"Money'll do Just as well," I reckon?"
said the capitalist. "You don't think I'm
going to turn you over my bank account,
no you?"
He reached over in his narrow couch
and extracted a handful of good round
cartwheels from the pockets of his trous
ers and dropped them jingling one by one 'â 
Into the outstretched palm of the African.
"When he had deposited ten he thought he
had done the square thing, but the porter
did not tell him to stay his hand.
"Look here," exclaimed the mine op
erator, "you must be a hog, all right. I'd
rather have your job than be President of
the United States if you hold 'em all up
In this way."
"Foh <ie Lawd's sake, boss," exclaimed
the Pullman autocrat, his eyes bulging
out like the cork of a champagne bottle,
"All â Ah didn't call foh no money; Ah
axed foh yo' berth check."
Hut he got the money to keep his mouth
shut.

Corporal H. \V. McCauley of the First
Colorado is un old newspaperman. He
is one of the Yale '88 boys and a brother
of Major C. A. M. McCauley of the regu
lar army.
"The run from Manila to Nagasaki was
not a: very pleasant one," said he last
night, "but our trip through the Inland
sea and from Yokohama to San Fran
cisco was delightful, except that we felt
the cold. When we got up to 41 north
some of us nearly froze to death.
"Strange to say we left Manila on thÂ«
very day, July 18, on which we landed at
Luzon just one year before. Soon after
.leaving port we got into the tail end ot
a typhoon and for forty-eight hours we
were hove to. Captain Hart could have
pushed through it. but in order to do so
he would have had to batten down every
thing and that' would have been a terrible
hardship for the sick men. They were
sure we were lost at Nagasaki and were
getting a boat ready to send out and look
for us whe.n we got there.
"All â¢ the volunteers in the Philippine*
are right good fellows and they fight as
though they were veterans. All of them
are anxious to get home, but" still they
are willing to remain until Uncle Sam
can fill their places.
"When we left San Francisco last year
Colonel Irving Hale was in command of
our regiment, but last September he was
promoted to be a brigadier general and
placed in charge of the second brigade
of the second division of the Eighth
Army Corps. He got a leave of absence
and left Manila with us on the Warren.
At Yokohama he and Mrs. Hale left us,
however, and will come home via Hono
lulu on the Doric. We are all glad to, be
home again and mighty glad to hear that
we will be mustered out in San Fran
cisco."
Fireman. J. McComb was the cause of
the mutiny on the Warren. He was sick
during' the run to Manila and no one
could get him to work. The engineers say
he was only shamming and c the day the
trouble began he was drunk. When the
launch was going ashore he got into it,
and refused, to go aboard again when
Captain Hart ordered him. He was car
ried oh deck and then called Captain
Hart every name he could la? his, tongue
to.. Far that he was put in irons and a
few hours later twenty-two of the firemen
struck. ' ' * - â â¢""â â -*
Captain Hart called them all before him
and asked them what was the cause of
all the- trouble. They said they would re
fuse duty until McComb was. taken out of
irons.: The captain refused to. give the
fireman his liberty, and explained to the
men the" trouble they were making for
themselves. They said they would take
the chances/ Captain Hart then reported
the matter to Transport Quartermaster
Major S. A. Cloman. and he called the
men before him and stated that it was a
case of mutiny. , He called them off by
name and asked each fireman if he. would
go back to work and each ' one of the
twenty-two said "no."
Next day the matter was reported to
the military" authorities, but before the
soldiers came out' to march â > them ashore
the firemen ,went to Captain Hart and
asked that they be allowed to go to work.
The captain told them It was top late, as
they were" now in the hands of the mili
tary authorities.- They were taken ashore
and tried. Whalen and Garrigan. the
ringleaders, got ten months each,
â¢ ightf^n others got -seven months each
and wo were let off with three months
hard, labor in Brill bad prison. They were
all. serving their sentences when the War
ren left. â â â¢â â¢â¢', â¢" '- .
The Warren brought news of the long
overdue British ship Macduff. The latter
is now out ISP days from Calcutta for
Portland. "5 per cent reinsurance is being
paid on her. â " She was spoken on August
14 latitude 39 degrees 50 minutes north,
longitude 133 degrees 5S minutes west, and
the signal "short of provisions" was fly
ing from her masthead. Captain Hart at
once stepped the Warren ana sen! a boat
load of hardtack, canned meat and vege
tables ami everything necessary to carry
the vessel to the Columbia River.
There was one exciting incident during
the Warren's run from Yokohama. Tne
second day out a sailor named Johnson
fell overboard. The ship was going at a
speed of thirteen knots, but she was
stopped, a boat lowered and Johnson was
aboard and the transport under way
again inside of eighteen minutes- pretty
good showing for a vessel crowded with
troops. -?*â¢â ;

of the transport As soon as the. word
was paÃsed that within an hour the trans

cheer wnt up that did not die away until
the last of the tugs which bore the wel
coming crowds had headed for the shore.
"It's good to talk to Americans once
more." shouted one of the soldiers. "Why,
I would rather live on a Piute Indian res

Another one cried out to a friend whom
he had recognized in the throng on the
deck of the Fearless: "This seems more

them shook their heads. A number ven
tured to remark that much greater
progress could be made if a more ag
gressive policy were pursued, but all agree
that it will take years of campaigning to
accomplish the work.
"It is the last place on earth for a whtie
man," said a soldier who â  had traveled
over most of the islands, "and nothing
can ever be done in the way of agricul
ture. Americans are foolish to go near
the place, for they will come away just
as disappointed as we are." .
Near the stern of the vessel were gath
ered the soldiers who had â  been dis
charged.' "About seventy of them were
from the Engineer Corps, sixty from Bat
tery D. Sixth Artillery, and the remainder
from the cavalry and infantry companies
now at Manila. Complaints of the food
! they had received on the transport were
heard on every hand and they say that
I a discharged soldier has no more chance
| of civil treatment at the hands of the
military authorities than a grain of sand
in a "whirlwind. ... â 'j
"If we refuse to re-enlist they have no
more use for us," was a frequent state
' ment. "Many of us went to the islands for
j the purpose of establishing a 'little busi
! ness when our terms expired, but no dis
i charged soldier can ever, get a' license to
drive a hack or conduct a peanut stand.
We are put aboard a transport and
shipped home.". â . 'â¢*'.'"
The boys assert that when the proposi
tion of re-enlistment was first put to them
advantageous offers were made, but that
I recently movt of them, have dwindled
: down to practically nothing. The price of
a passage to and from Manila was one of
the first offers. By the route proposed
this would amount to a neat little sum.
Before any of the soldiers had a chance
to take advantage of the offer the au-
I thorities found a shorter route- by which
! the transports could come home and re
â¢ duced, the bonus considerably.
Before the Warren departed, the rainy
i season had set in and it was with diffi
i culty that bodies of troops made much
â  progress. ,' :. â  .
TRUE TO HER LOVE
EVEN UNTO DEATH
A Soldier's Sweetheart, Who
Preferred the Grave to
Inconstancy.
There has heen many a sad, pathetic
story connected with the return to their
! native land of the men who forsook every
thing to defend the honor of their coun
try in the far-off Orient, but nothing that
has yet been told contains such heart
| rending, tragic interest as does the story
I which will this morning cast Its pall of
! sorrow over the homecoming of Private
Mack Langton of Company B of the Fir^t
Colorado Regiment. The only consolation
left him will be the knowledge that the
object he most cherished deserved to bo
dearest of all. and that the girl upon
wh^m he had staked his heart remained
true to him until her own was pierced by
the bullets fired by a murderous rival.
Three years ago Maud iicConkey of
I Denver met Mack Langton. the son >f J.
C. Langton, one of Denver's most prom
inent citizens. At first the young
people fell in love with each other. They
associated with each "other constantly,
and when I.angton. enlisting in the Colo
rado regiment, marched away to the
wars he left behind him the sweetheart
who had promised to be his wife if he
should return alive to claim her. Soon
after the young soldier"s departure a fel
low .by the name of Charles Bond ap
peared on the. scene and commenced *o
pay his addresses to Miss McConkey. The
fact- that he was a divorced man and un
welcome to the girl's mother seemed to
be no obstacle to a passion which was
{ only fanned to a more furious heat by
I the attempt made by the young lady her-
I self to wave It away.
The more opposition ho met with the
more persistent he became, until his at
tentions to tne young lady ceased to be
alone a matter of embarrassment, and be
j came a matter of uneasiness as well.
On the Rth of this month Miss McCon
-1 key received an illiterate epistle from
i Bond requesting that she meet him at an
appointed spot, and telling her if she did
not he would force his way to her. The
frightened girl complied: She left her
home at about 9 o'clock In* the evening
! saying she was going to the residence of
: a friend, and was never again seen alive.
The following morning Bond was dlscov-
S ered at the corner of Thirty-second and
I Clear avenues with a bullet in his chest.
I He was at once taken to the Receiving
Hospital, and there, believing he was
about to rlie. confessed to having mur
dered Miss McConkey in River Front Park
ana then attempting his own suicide.
i Officers at once went to the locality he
directed them to and there found the body
of the girl, who had remained constant to
her soldier lover until death claimed her
I for his own. Three bullets brad lodged in

THE CUBAN REVENUES
TliK military government sustained in Cuba by
the United Mates controls the revenues of the
island, derived from taxation of the people.
It has beefl reported that very large sums have been
diverted from those revenues to contribute to the per
son.! I siuriptuous form in which our officers
arc maintained in Havana and in the provinces where
â  -v (.ij>\Hrnur and staff are located.
The rip --rts have been to some extent contradicted
iated Press, but the matter merits
iurt! â â  : ition. for it there be any considerable
found thjnri it will be a serious scandal to our
.n the island.
One *if ..tilt 'complaints which produced the Cuban
n \yas â  of the pomp and pageantry at the
draining of- the people's substance to
by Spain.
The island iV exhausted by a long revolution, which
destroyed its in<!;i-t He? and impoverished its people.
Their low condition of starvation and misery was used
to inflanje. the.;' unselfishness of this country and bring
into action its spirit of sacrifice as a justification â 
the war. One needs to go back only a year and a
Half to be face to face with the only spirit and the sole
purpose for which Americans were willing to bear the
burden of a foreign war. That war formally ended
the 14th of August, 1898. We did not take pos
n of Cuba until some time later. If the repre
sentations of the condition of the island and the
wretchedness of its people were true, it is unbecoming
to take from their poverty large sums of money to
be 'spent in sustaining the Spanish methods of ex
travagance in order to impress them with our powt-r.
Nor do our people wish either civil or military of
ficers sent abroad to ape viceregal form?. Such
Kewgawry unfits them for the simple ways which
should be the ways of a republican people. If a con
siderable number of these officers get a taste of the
use of irresponsible power abroad and take money
from Cuban taxpayers without asking their consent,
to spend in trappings and luxuries, they will lose re
spect also for the home taxpayer, and as far as they ,
c.r impress the current of domestic government will
make it as.much as possible irresponsible to the peo
ple, to.'the etrd that the luxuries attending the admin
-6i a- satrapy may continue to beguile their
hours when at home. The people did not go into the
Spanish war; for, any such purpose.
Ex- President Harrison, it will be admitted, is 1
pretty good Republican and a pretty good American.
He was recently interviewed in Paris by some friendly
French statestntn who are uneasy about the future
purposes of this country, especially as indicated by our
continued occupation of Cuba.
General Harrison quoted from our declaration of
war against Spain: "The United States hereby dis
claims agy disposition or intention to exercise sov
ereignty, jurisdiction or control over said island, ex
cept for the pacification thereof, and asserts its de
termination when this is completed to leave the gov
ernment arid-control of the island to its people." He
then assured, the Frenchmen that "the United States
have rib : des.ir.fe-;for war or conquest. Their attitude
is limited qiitsifje their own borders to the safeguard
ing of Hr.crty. Our written constitution is so con
structcd-tbatr n6 act of a party in power can become
an actuality, without the consent of the people, and
the people. are. peaceful, industrious and opposed to
row veatyres.. Ideas on colonization are attributed
to us tJiat tire riot ours. America wishes to grow by
the expansion ;of her commerce, by exporting her
1 riduct-., and riot by force of arms." We think it
v.onla puzzle any one to find in our written consti
:i authority to wring money from the taxpayers
of Cuba to spend in viceregal luxury in the palace
at Havana. â 
William Waldorf Astor may have a chance yet.
Since the announcement of her engagement to Lieu
-1 Cgrnwalh'3-West, Lady Randolph Churchill has
been cut dead by the members of the young man's
family and the :Marlborottghs. Now is Willies time
to cut in and cut out the "Loot."
The Emperor of Russia has congratulated the
Chinese Government upon its wisdom in permitting
him to gain a- strong foothold in the oriental king
dom. It is safe to say that Chinese officers of state
do not see the joke in the Czar's congratulation
ENTERPRISING CAPITAL.
IN line with the very intelligent and interesting in
terviews of the returned volunteers as to the phy
siography of the Philippines are the descriptions
that come to us of physical conditions in the West
Indies. Of course there is nothing new in all this.
jit was exploited by Yon Humboldt, by Darwin,
Draper and a score oi naturalists long ago. It was
learned in the hard school of experience by the
'. Scotch Darien Company and the Acadian refugees to
j.French Guiana. The wealth of the world has always
: been in the temperate zone. Its poverty has enjoyed
! nakedness as a luxury in the tropics.
Money may prosper in the torrid zone, because
men do not. The wages of labor there are fixed by
; tiie cost of living, and that is fixed by the spon
taneotls fruits of nature and a climate that makes
> clothing a superfluity. I
Enterprising capital has been quick to see this, and
English syndicates have promptly taken advantage of
â  the necessity of Cuban planters by buying all the
i good tobacco lands in the island. Their investments
! therein now amount to $10,000,000, and their agent
[ has recently said, "You Americans will hereafter buy
! your tobacco of Englishmen."
Professor Knapp of the Agricultural Department
; at Washington, who made a voyage of investigation
to the Philippines and reported that they offered un
limited opportunities to the American home-seeker,
: contradicted that rose-colored estimate by reporting
that English syndicates were on the ground getting
title to all available hemp, sugar and tobacco lands.
This is quite without precedent. Our people have
been blisy with the war, which is to put the West
Indies and the Philippines in our possession, while
the financial enterprise of Englishmen has been
taking in everything that would make that possession
of value to us. The English avoided investments
under the flag of Spain, and one motive of the Brit
ish Government in holding Continental Europe at
bay while we dispossessed Spain was the desire that
', we should bag the game that her capitalists might
eat it.
As our conquests have been put on the material
j level entirely, it is something of a disappointment to
find that the profits expected by our own people are
i already permanently secured by the English. Those
who own the soil of a tropical country are the
I masters of the profits of its trade. The sole means of
producing wealth in the tropics is the handling of
the soil. Manufacturing is not a torrid zone possi
bility, beyond the simplest forms. The soil is about
the only source of wealth.
1 The people of the United States seem to be placed
in the rather peculiar condition of spending life and
money to make secure the ownership of tropical soil
by foreigners and to increase and safeguard the
profits to aliens, who will work it by cheap labor in
competition with cur better paid white labor at
home !
The profits of Englishmen in the English crown |
colonies have been decreasing for years. There they
must administer government and pay its costs. It.
has become necessary, therefore, that they shall lay
their eggs in a nest built by others, and they have
played the cuckoo trick on the United States.
Not long ago the people of this country resented
the ownership of realty in the United States by Eng
lishmen, and this resentment went so far that Cali
fornia adopted an amendment to her constitution to
prevent such ownership in this State.
Surely it is a marvelous change for the same peo
ple to be paying the cost of an expensive war and
sending their sons to perish in its battles to open I
property to the prompt ownership of English capital
and stand guard over it while it yields the high profit i
of low-priced labor to its alien owners!
The attorney for Augustus Howard, the man of
many aliases, accused of many crimes, says hi.
client is of legal age and will decide for himself
whether he should surrender to the police. Perhaps |
the police will have something to say on this very
important point if ever they set eyes on the elusive
Mr. Howard.
The price of babies is declining, although this is
not necessarily an indication that the supply is
greater than the demand. A Chinese of Boise City |
recently bought one for $25, and now the mother !
repents of the sale. The court will decide if the price !
was reasonable.
THE AWAKENING OF THE SOUTH
AT the recent meeting of the Georgia Agricul
tural Society the lion. D. A. Tompkins made
the principal address, the one which gave the
tone to the whole meeting and shaped the tenor of the
resolutions adopted. A full report has been published
in the Atlanta Constitution, and it merits all the
space given, for it is full of that sort of eloquence
which impels not only to action, hut to right action.
Mr. Tompkins is not one of the Southerners who
despairs of his country. He docs not believe the
problems of the South are incapable of solution. He
is of the opinion that the strife between white an:l
black is largely due to the lack of sufficient employ
ment. The Georgia farmer, he says works on an
average not mofe than ioo days in the year, that
being the amount of labor required to raise a cotton
crop. He would have the farmers co-operate with
o*nc another to build factories for the employment ot
the idle whites and Macks who have nothing to do
b\]^ to quarrel with one another. To provide a mar
ket for the cotton goods thus produced he favors lib
eral subsidies for American shipping. On that point
lie said: "We must develop and maintain our ship
ping. We must have a merchant marine and a navy
to protect it. We have reached that point in our in
dustrial development when, if we extend our manu
factures further, we must have more markets. You
have built railroads by subsidies. There is hardly a
town, county or State that has not contributed in
bonds or in money or in lands, or the use of streets,
to the construction of one or more railroads. Al
most every railroad in the United States > has had
more or less bounty money to aid in its construction.
Tcnvns vie with each other to-day in offering bounties
to obtaii. new lines of roads, and everybody feels that
it pays to do so. Yet there is an incomprehensible
prejudice against giving even a fair mail contract to
a new line of vessels to a foreign country. England
and Germany are willing enough to send their sub
sidized ships here after our 5-cent cotton. They will
never permit them to come for our 15-ccnt cloth.
These countries want to hold the manufacture and
hold the trade. We must have our own ships, as we
must also have a navy to protect them. 1 '
The speech was equally strong in support of sound
money, and financial integrity. "Wherever there are
markets for American goods." he said, "we need
American banking facilities. We mu>t have a money
upon which the people of all the world can rely. The
American "banknote must be at all times and in all
places as good as the English pound sterling."
The address was in substance though not in form
a vigorous protest against that of the president of the
society, J. Pope Brown, upon whicji we commented
yesterday, and it is significant that it was the speech
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 17, 1899.
I which made the strongest impression upon the so
ciety. In a notable passage Mr. Tompkins said: "A
passenger once fell overboard from a Mississippi
River steamboat at a point where the river was about
two miles wide and looked as though it might be a
mile deep. The man couldn't swim, and was naturally
very much frightened. He was floundering about and
seemed in imminent danger of drowning. The pilot
from the first kept shouting to him, 'Stand up,' and
when he finally did make him understand and the
man stodd up he found that the water was not over
knee deep. Many of our troubles are very much like
the troubles of this man. If we knew the surround
ings, or could in any way find out just what to do, we
would be able to escape a sea of trouble by simply
standing up. The purpose of my talk to-day will be
to show that the life-saving thing for the cotton
farmer is the cotton factory."
That is indeed the true way for the South to save
her civilization. By providing work for her people
all the year round through the establishment of fac
tories, by gaining markets through the means of a
liberal policy toward our merchant marine and the
establishment of our -finances on a safe basis, the
South will pass easily over the difficulties in her
path.
General Jiminez, the Dominican insurgent, prob
ably realizes now that there is a vast difference be
tween expectation and realization. He boasted that
the people of San Domingo were falling over each
other in an effort to make him President. He has
discovered that their soldiers fell all over his and al
most massacred his army.
It is said that Thomas B. Reed will remain in the
House of Representatives and from the floor will
oppose the policy of the administration. If he re
mains faithful to his own interpretation of the privi
leges of the chairman he will be heard only when the
Speaker is in a pleasant mood.
RAILWAY DEVELOPMENTS.
STATISTICS of railways in the United States
issued by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion for the year 1898 embody a considerable
I number of tables significant of the cconomj of rail
way transportation brought about by recent improve
ments in cars and locomotives.
The aggregate railways of the country amounted on
June 30, IS9B, to a total of 186,396 miles, being an
increase lor the year of 1967 miles. The increase was
distributed so uniformly over the Union that only
six States showed a construction for the year in ex
cess of 100 miles, these being Arkansas, California.,
Louisiana, Missouri, New York and Wisconsin.
Notwithstanding this increase of nearly 2000 miles
of railway, the number of freight locomotives in use j
increased by only 229. while the number of passenger
locomotives diminished by 61. Taking all loco
| motives, including those used in the service of the
companies as well as those used for freight and pas
senger service, the increase over, the previous year
was but 248.
The total number of cars reported for the year was
1.326,174, being an increase of 28.6)4 as compared
with the previous year. A classification of the cars
shows that the number employed for the passenger
service decreased by 31, while the freight service ;
showed an increase of 27,006, the remainder of the )
increase being in cars used for the service of the com
panies.
It is pointed out in the report that "these facts sug- 1
gest that there has been a greater expansion in freight
than in passenger traffic," and it is added: "The
number of cars leased also shows, a decrease of 4364,
las compared with the previous year, and the cor
responding figures for the years from 1894 to 1898,
inclusive, indicate that this decline conforms to an
established tendency. Whether this tendency is in
cident to a period marked by a relative decrease
in railway construction, or whether it indicates a
change of the financial policy of railway corpora- 1
tions, cannot be safely determined from data at :
hand."
Certain other statistics given in the report are in
teresting in. this connection. From a table showing!
â¢the relation of cars and locomotives to mileage it ap
pears that in 1894 there were 728 cars in the service â¢
for every 100 miles of road operated, while in 1898
there "^jre but 718. Computed for the United States |
as a whole it appears that an average of 1,343,906 pas- I
senger miles are to be credited to each passenger j
locomotive, and that 5,530,498 ton miles are to be !
credited to each freight locomotive. "In both cases," |
says the report, '"the work of locomotives shows a <
considerable increase as compared with the previous ]
year."
All these statistics tend to show the increased
economy of railway transportation due to improved
locomotives and a consequent enlargement of the
carrying capacity of the cars. Since nearly 2000 ad
ditional miles of railway can be operated with but
little addition in the way of cars and locomotives and I
men to handle them, it would seem there might be a j
reduction it* railway rates without injury to the com
panies.
It has been left to Richard Croker to make the
most caustic condemnation, of New York Democrats. 1
lie says that the investigations of the Mazet com- i
mittee are, making ten thousand Democrats a day in i
New York. The Mazct committee is exposing the
criminal, vicious administration of New York affairs
by Democrats.
Anotlier war cloud is gathering over Europe. The !
Emperor of Austria met the Chancellor of Germany j
the other day and had time to talk to him only seven I
minutes from a car window. The correipondents are
greatly concerned over this. They possibly thought
that a talk of seven hours was necessary for the ex
change of international courtesies.
Colonel Charles Page Bryan, United States Minister
to Brazil, appears to be all right. While the execu
tives of that coun-try and Argentina are hugging each
other in the ecstasies of the recent rapprochement, the
colonel has been banqueting the correspondents.

but po delicately are they blended that
the general effect is more the subdued
glory of the moon than the- torrid splen

Oppenheimer until an occurrence' that"
took place a few days ago.
Tie was standing in front of the theater
silnning himself and looking down upon |
the passing Bhow when a lady, accom
panied by a little girl, went up to the
box office to purchase some tickets. While
she was .selecting the seats the little maid
wandered around looking at the gaudy
posters upon which were printed in gor
geous colors the different scenes of "The
Fairy Gtodmother." She looked at each j
one in succession until her eyes lit upon
the resplendent Selby standing as still as
a statue near one of the corners of the
theater entrance. Then she became ob
livious to all else. Standing back a little
she crossed her hands and gazed in rapt
admiration until her mother, finishing her
purchase, left the box office and, taking!
her hand, started to lead her away. Just I
then Selby moved.
"Oh," gasped the little girl, "mamma,
it's a real man."
That was all she said. But It was heard |
by Whirry and Harry Campbell ami it was
enough. The news spread and the josh- !
ing came so fast that Oppenheimer sim- !
ply gave carte blanche at the bar for I
every one connected with the theater and !
then fled.

FATHER M'CORRY TELLS
THE "STORY BEAUTIFUL"
LECTURES FOR THE BENEni
OF ST. BRENDAN'S.
Stereopticon Views Are Used to Illus
trate His Numerous
Topics.
The lecture delivered yesterday for thÂ«
benefit of St. Brendan's Church by Fathei
MaeCorry of Old St. Mary's was as grea(
a success as ever a lecture could be. ThÂ«
oratory of tho brilliant young priest was
as eloqupnt as his subject was beautiful
and he held the rapt a*. Lentlon of his au
dience for the better part of two hours
He was introduced by Father Nugent oj
St. Brendan's.
The lecture consisted of telling the old
old story of the Christ life in a newei
wayâ the dressing of the "Story Beau
! tiful" in a new, fresh' garb. The repro
! duction of Hofmajin's paintings was a
' sermon in Itselfâ his Christ is a "World's
Christ." The coloring was chaste and
delicate throughoutâ in every case a
faithful imitation of the original canvas,
In some instances the stereopticon pro
lections wer. exquisite, the "Flight Intc
: Egypt" and "The Rich Young Man" had
everything but the throb of life. "Chrisi
in Gethsemane" brought an Involuntarj
hurst of reverent admiration from the
lips "f every one who beheld it. "I have
i seen the original of that 'Gethsemane,' "
said the speaker simply, "and I do noi
think that a man of liner feeling could
look at it for half an hour and live."
Throughout the lecture the word-paint
ing of Father MaeCorry, his descriptions
of scenery, Hocia! customs, episodes in thi
life of the "Man of Sorrows." vied in bril
liancy and color with the pictures on the
screen.
A moral lesson artfully drawn was
! affixed to nearly every slide as it ap
peared upon the canvas. The organ pre
lude, accompaniment and recessional bj
Miss Criorgiani was- strikingly appropriate
i and faultless in execution.
Altogether no man or woman whose
I soul has not been gnawed away by Belf-
Ishneas and sin could have gone out after
' hearing this telling of the "Story Beau
; tiful" without feeling an irresistible im
petus to better and higher and nobler
! things.
What Some of the California Boys
Think.
No mnrc guard duty, picket and drill,
No kitchen police and fatigue.
We've cleaned up barracks, carted out
swill.
We've tramped it for many a league;
We've slept in shelter tent, hovel and
trench
While the rain soaked through and
through;
Starved with scant rations, sick at their
stench,
We've cursed till the air was blue.
But now, that at last we are home once
more.
Have laid aside rifle and kit.
Will we seek again fame on a foreign
shore?

PLAIN TALK ABOUT THE WAR
A strange infatuation seems to possess
the minds of some people who are called
religious, proclaiming, as they do, from
pulpit, platform and press that this na
tion is to-day engaged in "a holy war"
in trying to subjugate the Filipinos.
Several so-called eminent clergymen
have said In sermons recently delivered
that "God ordained that this nation
should conquer and subdue" the Filipino
rebels, "that thereby civilization may be
advanced and His name glorified." Texts
have been culled, from "the Book" with
painful care to fit the position assumed
by "these holy men of God." Some of
our religious journals have been trying
to prove that this natiorv is the great
emancipator of the world, and that we
have been delegated by the Almighty to
"wade through seas of blood" to the end
of bringing the needed gospel to starving
souls, providing any of the heathen should
be found alive afar the exterminating
process has "had its full course and been
glorified."
The Congregationallst of Boston in a re
cent number very tersely says: "The fer
tility, audacity and agility of a certain
school of Interpreters of the Bible is well
Illustrated in the supposition advanced at
the Bible Institute last week in Chicago
by a popular Boston exegete. He found
in Isaiah IS and 14 and Jeremiah 50 and 51
sure proof of the annexation of thu Phil
ippines by the United States, and the
further striding eastward of what Beems
to him a materialistic civilization until
China shall have been captured and Baby
lon once more become the seat of the
world's mightiest civilisation, albeit one
that will be given over to anti-Christ The
same report adds that thousands sit en
raptured daily under such exegetical leg
. ra< main as this.. What wonder that men
who are told that such a uso of the
Serlptures is legitimate say that one can
find in the Wii'le whatever one Wishes u>
find there?"
On the other hand, a religious iournal

teachers and editors of religious journals
take BUCn views and enunciate such doc
trines, which are certainly contrary to th<
teaching oi Jesus? The editor of the Da

public scorn a leading clergyman of San
Francises tor saying at a recent conven
tion: I tell you that if Qod is upon the

much less a Christianising influence, to
those whom the church seeks to convert?
A matter of history comes back at this
moment lo show the feeling and the
spirit of the Filipino Junta in April. 1898,
Detore there was thr least suspicion that
our administration intended to take and
li .Id the islands. The Junta Issued its
1 reclamation in these terms: "Compa
triots: Divine Providence is about to
place independence within our reach and
in a way the most free and independent
could hardly wish for. The Americansâ
not from mercenary motives, but for the
sake of humanity and the lamentations of
bo many persecute* people â have consid
ered it opportune to extend their protect
ing worth to our beloved country."
Then follows a strong appeal' for Filipino
patriotism and aid, "to help our American
liberators": and- "Where you see the
American. Hag flying, there assemble in
numbers; they are our redeemers." All
credit was at that time given to the now
so-called "rebels" for the help bestowed.
"The chink of the dollar had not thc-n
been heard." In June* 1898, Merritt's re
port indicated that a plot had been formed
for conquest < Then came the political
term "destiny" and the religious framing
of "the will of God." How quickly "the
rights of man" are made to stand asM
for power and. greed. Such betrayal of th*,
principles on which our republic was
founded will-surely be met by a just retri
bution and punishment. -. ,â â â¢â  ;.
The sentiment about "destiny" and "thÂ«
will of God" will not stand the test of
everlasting truth when measured by the
will of God himself, unpainted by selfish
human hands and desires. â â¢ â  â  ; /

GRENADIER â E. M. M., City. The
term grenadier was originally applied to
soldiers whose duty it was to throw hand
grenades, as the duty was very danger
ous and the grenadiers were always lirst
in an assault only veteran soiuiers were
selected for that service, and thus they
formed a kind of military elite. "When
hand grenades went out of use tiie name
grenadier was continued, and the soldiers
called by that name generally formed a
company of a regiment distinguished by
the height of the men and a particular
dress, as, for instance, the high bearskin
cap; and it holds the place of honor,
namely, the right when in line and the
front when in column of attack.
BUILDING IN CASINO â Subscriber,
City. In the game of casino, if two part
ners are playing, each may make a build,
and if neither is taken by either of the
opposing partners, I one of the builders
may take up the build of his partner and
call It by the plural numberâ that is, if
there are two builds of eight on the table,
the builder may take his partner's build,
place it on his own and call out eight.*,
not eight. In a case of that kind the
partner whose build was taken up â  and
made eights by his partner should have
taken up the build, having an eight, and
not have thrown his eight on the table,
for he took chances of his opponents
building on it with an ace or a deuce. So
long as the builders were partners it
makes no difference which- one takes up
the build. ; â  ,

KISSING BUG.
Stopped a Band Concert by Biting the
Cornet Soloist.
It has been wisely said that "music
hath charms to soothe the savage i
breast." Verily harmonious sounds
have power to affect the "kissing bug"
in that direction to the superlative de
gree, as Mr. Charles Colley, cornet so
lolst in Professor Guido Vogel's band,
can testify and give ocular proof.
Mr. Colley wae on the programme for
a solo during Professor Vogel's band
concert at Henton Park the other
afternoon. For his subject he selected
the "Kiss Me" waltz from "Merry
War." The crowd at the park ad
mired the selection greatly, and set
tled comfortably on the benches to hear
the Bweet-volced cornet send melting
strains into their ears when Mr. Colley
arose.
Mr. Colley stood erect and bowed In
response to the plaudits. He threw back
his shoulders, placed the cornet at the j
proper angle, with the mouthpiece to
his lips. Leader Vogel tapped his vio
lin bow on the music stand in front of
him, beat the air slowly a few times,
and "Kiss Me" softly, sweetly issued
from the cornet in a cadenza.
The strains rose and swelled in vol
ume, the hearts of the listeners swell
ing tt/ward ecstasy with the music,
when â discord! A high note jumped
the track and ran off in a wail like a
cat call. Mr. Colley yanked the cornet
down with one hand, slapped his mouth j
vigorously with the other and stamped
on the floor.
Professor Vogel stopped beating
time. The other musicians turned to
ward the soloist in surprise. The au
dience tittered, or some of it did. Mr.
Colley retreated to the rear of the
stand, and was hastily joined by Pro
fessor Vogel. The soloist's lips were
rapidly swelling, and there was a tiny,
blood-red spot visible in the center uf
the swollen place.
He had been kissed by a kissing
bug.
Further playing on the cornet was
impossible for him. Professor Vogel
made explanations to the audience, and
Mr. Colley sought a physican. â St.

GAGE FINDS HE
PERPETRATED A
HUGE BLUNDER
Let Contracts for a
State Mansion.
HE IGNORED COMMISSIONERS
IS NOW LIABLE PERSONALLY
FOR BIG DAMAGES.
Paid No Attention to Laws Which
Require Advertisements for
Public Build
ings.
Governor Gage has, metaphorically, "put '
his foot In it," and he Is likely to have
to pay several thousand dollars of his
own money to get his pedal, extremity out. :
The trouble came about through the Gov- j
ernor's mistaken notion that the last Leg- |
islature appropriated $50,000 for the erec- I
tlon of a mansion at Sacramento for the j
sole, exclusive and private use of Mr.
Gage. As a fact, the money was appro- ;
priated for the construction of a residence j
for the use of future Governors, as well j
as the present executive. The act provid- :
ing for this pave the power to construct
to the State Capitol Commission, com- !
posed of the Governor, the Attorney Gen- I
eral and the Secretary of State. From
all accounts neither advice nor sugges
tions from the two latter officials were
sought by the Governor.
Several weeks ago Attorney General
Tirey L. Ford was taking a much needed
vacation and Secretary of State Curry
was in this city. During their absence, so
it is said. Governor Gage concluded that
he would go ahead with the work of
erecting a residence for himself at the
Suite's expense. Plans and specifications
were prepared and accepted, to Gage's ;
satisfaction. Contracts for lumber, stone,
ornamental work and all ki:.<i< of mate
rials wore let, also to Gages satisfaction,
and there seemed to be little doubt but
that the bills would be paid. In the
meantime the other two commissioners ;
trere either ignorant of what the execu- I
live was doing or else their opinions were !
given but little weight. It is customary;
on all such big contracts for the contract- ;
ors to get '"first payment" as soon as the
material is on the way or some of the
work done.
Here is where the first obstacle was
encountered, for it is said that Controller
Colgan refused to draw his warrant for
the money on the ground that the letting
of the contracts did not seem to him to
be in conformity with the law. Then it '
was that Gage had to call upon his
brother Commissioner, Attorney General
Ford, for the advice which should have
been asked in the first place. Hon. W. J.
Foley, private secretary to "his honor,"
wrote an inquiry as to where the Gov
ernor "was at " on the big contracts al
ready let. Mr. Ford save the matter into
the "hands of Deputy Attorney General
William M. Abbott, whose opinion was
rendered recently, and to which Mr. Ford
subscribed: "1 will add that I have per
sonally examined the matter and am in
entire "accord with the conclusions reached
by Mr. Abbott. " The latter finds the
following points of law upon the case:
In 1572 "An act to regulate the erection
of public buildings and structures" w:is
Eassed, and section 1 provides that When
y any statute of this State power is
given to any State or county officer or
Boards of Supervisors, or Trustees, or
Commissions, etc.. "to erect or cause to
be erected or constructed any State or
other building or structure, it shall be the
duty of said officer or officers â¢ â â¢ â¢ to
advertise for plans and specifications in
detail for said building or other structure
p.nd to state in said advertisement the
amount authorized by law or otherwise
to be expended for the erection of said
building or structure; and also the pre
mium to be awarded to the architect
whose plans and specifications for the
same may be adopted."
Several amendments were made to the
original law, but the main points for the
method of procedure were strengthened.
In fact, when the act and amendments
are read together th^y provide a com
plete scheme for the manner and mode
of the erection of buildings by the State
and minutely describe and lay down the
mode of procedure from the advertising
for plajis to the completion of the.build
ing. Mr. Abbott in his opinion says:
The act is general in its terms and applies
to all buildings erected by the rotate where
the contract price exceeds the amount men
tioned in the statute ($3000). Unless there la
a ?aving ofauÃe in the act of 1898 providing for
the erection and construction of a residence
for the Governor this act would apply, and
Lhe manner and mode of nroceedine therein
raid down should be followed. â¢ â¢ .
From a careful examination of the act i
I find no provision which would seem to ex
empt the State Capitol Commission from the
general building act of the State in the con
struction of the Governor's residence.
Thus the Governor's stubbornness has
thrown him up against the "real thing,"
and for several days he has been jumping
around lively to have canceled the con
tracts he entered into. Of course, these
contracts are not worth the paper they
are written on, and here comes the awk
ward part of the business. Governor
Gage cannot "pass the buck" and make
the State pay the damages that are sure
to accrue, and the contractors, who have
no doubt gone to great expense and trouble
to get things started and material on the
way to Sacrament", are very sure to come
down upon the members of the commis
sion for stiff damages. As two of the
latter were not parties to the letting of
the contracts it is not likely that they
will stand for any of the mischief that
Governor Gage has made.

SLEW HIS SISTER'S LOVER
And Then Became the Most Famous
Bandit of the Santa Fe Trail.
The most famous bandit ever known
on the Santa Fe trail was Esplnosa. a
Spaniard, who at one time, had great
wealth and lived upon' a hacienda upon
the banks. of the Rio Grande near Santa
Fe, like one 01 the Dukes of his native
country. .He claimed- descent from a
knight in the army of Cortez, and the
walls of his house were ornamented by
ancestral portraits painted by famous
artists of Spain. He had immense herds
of sheep and cattle, and upon his duke
dom ruled over several . hundred peons,
who regarded him as a king.
After the American occupation of New
Mexico Espinosa fell into bad company.
The newcomers taught him new games
and played him unfriendly tricks. They
trespassed upon his hospitality. They in
vaded his hacienda, lived in luxury at his
expense, drank his wine and ate his
mutton and then won his money at cards.
He lost so muc.i that he became nnan
cially embarrassed and was compelled to
mortgage his herds. It was a great mor
tification to the proud Spaniard, and
when it was too late he began to realize
that he had been imposed upon.
One day he made the acquaintance of a
rich young New Englander, who had
come to Santa Fe with a lot of money to :
engage in business. The Yankee visited
the hacienda, and soon made himself at
home there. It was said that he was in
love with Donna Espinosa, a beautiful
girl about IS years of age, and that his
affection was reciprocated. At one time
when Espinosa was pressed for money
the young Yankee received a large re
mittance from the East. He offered it to
the Spaniard, but the latter was too proud
to accept a loan from his sister's lover, j
The same night, however, after he had [
retired, the young man heard a burglar |
in his room, and in the struggle learned i
that the intruder was no other than his j
host. Being discovered, Espinosa drew a j
dagger and plunged it into the American's
heart.
The members of the household came
rushing into the room just as the victim
was dying. He told them what had hap
pened, and the sister of the murderer,
throwing. herself upon the body of her I
dead lover, cursca her brother as an as- j
sassin and a thief. The guests made no I
attempt to arrest him. but Espinosa knew i
that he was ruined, and in desperation
abandoned his nch and fled to the
Sangre de Christo Mountains, where he
made his headquarters for several years,
conducting successful . raids, upon the j
overland coaches and tne freight cara
vans along the Santa Fe trail and roboing j
ranch settlers in every" direction. The i

Outcome of Bout With Frank McConnell
at Woodward's Pavilion,
The Cincinnati Athlete Suffers Concussion of the

McConnell, Club Officials and the

As the outcome of the boxing' bout last

McConcell, together with Manager*

and the other seconds engaged in the
bout, were placed under arrest pending

McConnell won the bout In the four

aggressive men meet In the arena. As
they broke away after a clinch McCon

on the point of the jaw.
The blow had sufficient force to daze

condition of his game adversary and
went at him fiercely. He landed a right
which staggered Franey. and then
straightened him up with a light left.
Two right smashes sent the man from
Cincinnati staggering toward the center
of the ring, and then McConnell delivered

Results of Contests on the Charles
River Park Track.
BOSTON, Aug. ICâ The racing, which is
an important part of the League of Amer
ican Wheelmen meet, began this afternoon
ai the Charles River Park with a small
attendance. Two events were of great in
ti reft, the third of a mile national cham
hlp for professionals and the quarter
mile national championship for amateurs.
The former went to Tom Butler by a few
ln< hes over Major Taylor in a sensational
finish. The nmateur event was captured
reatly by E. \V. Peabody of Chicago,
with Albert Talllandier of Paris second
and L. Wilson of Pittsburg third. Five
riders had finished in a bunch, and !t was
Immediately claimed that Ben Goodson of
Australia had crowded the others on the
itretcb. After an appeal to the ref
eree it was announced that the final was
i: dead beat between Peabody and Tall
landier, and it will be ridden aga.ln to
morrow.
In the third of a mile professional the
event was put Into four heats, and all
thopc qualifying went into the semi-finals.
The pettiest fight was in the final, with
the two Butlers against Taylor. At the nis

Carthy and McLeod after him, leaving
Taylor watching Tom Butler, Bather than
risk the result Taylor, at half the dis

Franey was beaten at his own game.
He insisted on being allowed to hit in the
clinches, and this In the end proved his
I undoing. McConnell had the worst of
j some of these exehangc-s, but finally
i worried Franey so much that he appealed
Ito Referee Hiram B. Cook. He received
j no sympathy from either that official or
1 the spectators, who jÂ»-ered him when he

} that they must not hold and hit. Franey
was aggressive from the start, keeping
lat his man continually. McConneli

Umpire Question an
Important One.
HOT RACE FOR FIRST PLACE
LOCAIrS AND SACRAMENTO ABE
NOW IN THE LEAD.
Gala Days Are Expected Saturday
and Sunday, When the San Fran
cisco and Sacramento
Teams Cross Bats.
"Tis the umpire again, axid the league
players are losing themselves in howls
and Jeers. Mr. Long ia the target of a
reproachful attack by all concerned, and
they want to know what chance is left
them when balls are mistaken for strikes
j and bases for clods of earth.
In the game last Sunday between Oak
land and San Jose the Pruneplckers' in
dignation and impotent wrath working up
at lightning celerity within their breasts,
left the field just because Mr. Long or
dered Twirler Borchera off the field.
Long received the support of President
Moran In his authoritative stand, and
Borchers wrnt. The public sided with the
player as a matter of course, and the rest
of the game was full of opportunities for
the small boys on the bleachers. This is
not the first time that the umpire, ques
tion has demanded the full attention of
the league officers. Not many weeks ago
Cahill was the mark of the Dudes, and he
resigned before President Moran had the
opportunity to bid him good-by.
Long jnade a fizzle of his work on Sun- '
day last, but fortunately no detrimental
consequence marred the natural result of
the game. The umpire may have been
firm and triple-bound in steel as far as
: his own introspective belief went, but he
! certainly erred in many decisions.
This difficulty is a natural one, and al
most an essential of a baseball match,
but it may be remedied to suit the popu
lar demands as well as the players.
Three weeks ago the race for pennant
honors was most intense. To-day the I
I same conditions exist, and next Saturday i
| and Sunday will see the two leading ;
; teams of the league in deadly combat at j
| Recreation grounds. Just 10 per cent
>:es the local and Sacramento!
rs, in consequence of which either I
te;tm may or muy not lead the league
after the series of games at the end of
the week. The rivalry is at boiling
point and g<y>d baseball should result.
The standing of the teams is as fol
l wa :
n hen interviewed regarding the possible
vale 01 First Baseman Sullivan to St
Louis, Manager Harris stated: "Yes, it is
true that St. Louis has entered into nego
tiations with mo for the Rale of Sullivan
I also see an it.-m in the PittxburK papers
that Â«hat club in trying to secure him I
have h.-ard nothing directly, but it makes
v.n difference if all the league claba in the
couiftry want him. He is not for sale, and
I do not intend to part company with him
this season, notwithstanding what they
may offer me. I have made no changes In
my team fld'-o the first week of the sea
son, and I intend to go to victory or de
teat with the club as it is at present con
stituted. The club Is playing good ball
and the utmost harmony prevails."
The outfield work of i-an Francisco last
Sunday was eomething out of the ordin
ary, as they captured thirteen flies.
Fitzpatrick has been under the doctor's
care for the last ten days with a car
buncle on his neck, but it has been cut
and Is healing nicely. He will be In shape
to pitch two of the games this week.
Hanlon is by no means a novice in the
pitcher's box, as his work In Sunday's
game against Oakland will testify.
Stultz played magnificent ball in the se
rlÂ«a against San Francisco. Sacramento
has forgotten its old-time favorite, Ren*
ry Reitz, in Its admiration for their
present second baseman.
Am- lanes re/uses to fall in line for the
trade of himself and Dalrympie. Santa
Cruz seema to have the best of this bar
gain, for Dalrympie la with them and Ar
relanes says he will not play ball away
from his home town, Santa f'ruz.
Peeples has received his release from the
Oakland team at his own request. He and
Pitcher Shea have gone to Tuscarora
where they will play ball and are assured
of a lucrative position all year round.
President Koran is trying to secure
Frank Graves to umpire in the Sacramen
to and San Francisco series in conjunction
with Reub Levy. These games are so im
portant and will have such a direct bear
ing on the championship that the presi
dent of the league has resolved to have
the umpiring as nearly perfect as possible.
Mr. Graves has umpired all over the coun
try and is an ex-national leaguer. He Is
credited with being one of the best in the
country.
Donlln is being used as a general utility
man for the St. Louis, having pitched
played short, first and outfield since his
connection with that club. He is hitting
well but a trifle erratic In his fielding.
Oakland has protested the game of last
Sunday with San Jose. Ewing Is confident
Of a victory if it be played off.

HARTLEY WINS ON A FOUL.
La Fontise Too Affectionate During
the Clinches.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 18.â Frank Bart
ley of New Turk won on a foul from Mose
La Fontise of Montana to-night in the
twelfth round of a bout scheduled for
twenty rounds before the Colorado Ath
letic Club. The men fought at 140 pounds
and agreed to break clean in the clinches,
but the rule was twice broken by La
Fontise before the fight was stopped by
the referee, Billy Woods.
The foul was a most palpable one. In
the twelfth, after having been cautioned
by the referee for hitting in clinches, La
Fontise lost his temper and. gettinsr-bart
ley's head in chancery, punched him in
the jaw once before the referee could get
to him. The fight was immediately
awarded to Bartley, who went over to
La Fontlse's corner and offered him his
hand. Instead of grasping it. however,
La Fontise jumped up and started to mix
matters again. Bartley was willing, ap
parently, but their seconds rusl.-.d in ami
separated the men before any damage
was done.
Ip to the time of the foul tho fight was
fast, both men Going tfever work, with
honors about even. Bartley was the
more scientific of the two and gained the
only knockdownâ in the fifth round. He
repeatedly left his guard wide open, en
deavorir.g to "draw" La Pontise, but was
only partially successful. La Fontise
fought hard and willing. He rushed Bart
ley continuously and only the latter's
cleverness saved him on several oc
casions. Joe ChoynSki officiated in La
Fontlse's corner.

COSTLY WALL PAPER.
Valuable Stock Certificates Adorned
a Miner's Cabin.
"While in Johannesburg I saw a sample
of what was probably the most valuable
wall paper ever used in a house," said an
ex-official of the Government, who re
cently returned from South Africa. "It
was a stock certificate in "lie of the rich
eat mines of the Transvaal. In the early
days an Englishman who worked In one
of the first mines opened in the Barberton
district, took his pay partly in cash, hilt
mostly in script or sharea of the C"m
pany. For many yean the mine yielded
lit;!.-, and the company was unable to pay
dividends. After a time the Englishman
got disgusted with working the pick f..r
these nicely engraved but unmarketable
pttcee of paper, and left the place for an
other part of the country, wnere he con
tinued to work tuud for a living, barely
making both endl meet.
"The miner's wife, who had her own
idea of the beautiful, used the stock cer
tificates along with Home odds and ends
of prints and chromos. In papering the
walls of their cabin, and they remained
there as a grim reminder of the hollow
ness of man's expectations until one day,
a broker newly arrived from England,
hunted up the cabin and made an, offer
fur the trail paper. The price he'men
tioned was so large as to excite the min
er's curiosity, and on investigation, he
found that he was a large stockholder In
one of the most profitable gold' mines in
the world. Of course, he kept his stock
and to-day he 1p one of the mining kings.
P.ut even he probably has had no will
paper since that time that represented as
much wealth as did the covering of the
walls of his little cabin."â New York Sun"

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Aug. 16.â third day's
racing under the auspices of the Breeders'
Association opened with a match between
A. T. Jackson's Cherokee Prince and the
Santa Rosa Stock Farm's bay mare Pre
eita. Jackson was his own driver and Bob
Abies was up behind Precita. The mare
took the first heat in 2:25, but in the sec
ond both horses acted badly and the
Prince scored in 2:38. The third heat and
race went to Precita, who finished, after
several bad breaks, in 2:40.
In. the 2:12 pace, best two in three, for a
purse of $1000, there were six entries and
betting was brisk, with C. F. Kapp's bay
stallion 1 Direct a heavy favorite. He
was shut out in the first heat. Beach
wood coming first under the wire in 2:10 1 / Â£.
â¢The second heat went to F. G. Crawford's
bay gelding Don, In 2:lOVa. and he also
took the third and race in 2:13.
The third race was the 2:27 class trot,
mile heats, best three in five, for a $1000
purse. In this were four entriesâ Alex
Brown's Lottie, C. E. Clark's mare Sue.
John Morehead's black mare Sibyl S and
T. J. Crowley's mare Lottie Parkas, Lot
tie took the first two heats, with the
Crowley entry a good second. Then Lot
tie Parkes scored, taking the third heat
in 2:17. The fourth heat was sensational.
Lottie Parkes and Sibyl S came the last
half-mile like a team, and finished under
the whip in 2:1634- The judges called it a
dead heat. From that time on it was all
Sibyl S, she winning the next three heats
without being extended.
The last event of the day was the 2:23
class trot for a $200 purse. Hazel V.
owned by F. J. Yandle of Santa Rosa,
had friends all over the grounds, and
when she won the first beat in 2:17, beat
ing Monroe Salisbury's Thereon, the crowd
fairly went wild. The second heat was
won by Maud Newman In 2:17 V-,;, and that
mare took the third heat and the race in
2:2OVi in good form.
Alto Rio, a full brother of Del Norte
and Chehalis (2:o3'i), who is under lease
to H. Hellman for two years, broke one of
the bones In his left hind leg this morning
on the track during a work-out. The
accident occurred near the three-quarter
polo and no reason can be assigned. Hell
man himself was driving, when the horse
suddenly went over, scrambled up and
went over again. "W. J. Pascoe, the
trainer, rushed to the scene and the horse
was finally got to his stall. Dr. J. J.
Summertield was summoned and an at
tempt will be made to save the animal's
life. Alto Rio is now suspended in a
swing, with his leg in splints, but of
course it is too early to tell what the
result will be. Alto Rio is a splendid
animal and was entered through the cir
cuit as far as Los Angeles. He was con
sidered the best horse in Hellman's string
and one of the best now quartered here.
Some great sport is being put up here
this week. All the old-timers are on hand.
Samuel Gamble is officiating as starter.
In the judge's stand A. S. Cohen is In
command, while M. J. Straining of this
city and Robert Brown of Petaluma are

CIRCUIT RACES A SUCCESS.
Competitiftn Is Sharp in the Different
Classes and the Attendance
Large.
The megtlng of the Pacific Coast Trot
ting-horse Breeders' Association at Santa
Rosa is a pronounced success.
The opening day was all that could be
desired. The weather was ideal; the at
tendance In both grand stand and field
was large, and great racing resulted.
Tuesday witnessed a repetition of the for
mer day's successes, and furnished even
more sensational performances. The
whipping finish at the conclusion of the
2:30 pace was of such an exciting char
acter that the spectators in the grand
stand rose to the occasion and cheered
themselves hoarse. The first heat of the
two-year-old pace was negotiated in 2:21^.
The two days' racing was of the phe
nomenal order, and all indications point
to the fact that there will be no cessa
tion of great performances throughout
the entire week.
After the finish nf the two-year-old trot,
which was won by the filly Eula Mac,
Mr. Knight, her owner, was approached
by a prominent horseman and asked to
Bane a price on her. He was asked if a
"thousand" would buy her. Mr. Knight
declined the offer. The mare has been
worked by "William Hogoboom, and her
race Tuesday was her maiden effort. Mr.
Hogoboom has won more stake* with
youngsters in the last few years than any
other one trainer in California. Eula
Mac went the first mile in 2:2T%, and could
have stepped in 2:20 if her driver had been
so disposed.,
On Friday and Saturday excursions will
be run from all points along the line of
the railroad.
( >n Saturday Rudolph Spreekels will
start his great pair of mares, Marguerite
ainl Annie Rooney, to the pole to a bicycle
wagon. They will be driven for a team
record. Charles Jeffries, a capable reins
man, will handle the pair on that occa
sion.
Silkwood, the guideleap wonder, will also
be sent an exhibition mile on Saturday.
Kilkwood goes without a pacemaker arid
wears no Doots nor harness excepting a
light bridle and surcingle. He is turned
loose, scores for the word and if not pac-
Ing true and strong, returns to the wire
at the tap of the bell. Under these con
ditions within the last two weeks he has
I a mile within a half second of his
race record with a driver up.
The meeting now being held at Santa
Rosa is one of the greatest light harness
meetings ever held in California.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. ROCHESTER, N. x\, Aug. 16.â little
bay stallion John R. Gentry is still kins
of the light harness racers. At the Roch
ester Driving Park this afternoon the
three greatest pacing stallions of j the
American turfâ R. Gentry (2:00%).
Joe Patchen (2:01^4) -, and Searchlight
(2:04*4) â waged a battle royal for su
premacy. The attendance was 8000. The
track was very fast, and although there
was a slight breeze down the homestretch
it did not seem to hold the racers as they
turned into the stretch and headed for
the wire.
The first heat was the heat of the race.
The owner of Patchen, W. S. Haws, at
the last moment decided to drive in place
of Dickerson. The scoring was prompt,
and at the fourth attempt the horsea
started to pace the race of their lives.
At the quarter Gentry was a length and
a half behind, while Patchen and Search
light were on even terms. The leaders
held the same position when the half
mile pole was reached and Gentry had
dropped back another length and a half.
All three were driving at the three
quarters, but it was not until the stretch
was reached that the mass of cheering
and wildly excited spectators saw com
ing out of a cloud of dust in the rear of
the leaders, who were pacing like a team,
a flash of hoofs and the steel gray cap
and coat of "Billy" Andrews, who, with
a masterly hand, guided his magnificent
charge to the outside of the track and
shot to the front like a meteor. Faster
and faster, with every fraction of a Fec
ond seemingly gaining greater speed as
they came on toward the wire, moved the
flying sulkies, until the gap was closed.
A hundred yards from the wire Patchen
went into the air "and the driver began to
use his whip. Andrews drove steadily,
leaning far forward as if to help his
horse, and the little stallion, with a
mighty rush, passed under the wire a
neck and a trifle more to spare to the
good.
In the second and deciding heat Search
light acted badly a few lengths after the
start and broke often, the race narrowing
down to Gentry and Patchen. It was a
close battle the whole distance till the
stretch was reached. Then Gentry forged
ahead with comparative ease and won by
nearly a length and a half.
After the race was over W. H. Harri
man officiating, announced that he was
ready to match Searchlight against Gen
try for $10,000, the day to take place at
any time within the present week. Sum

HOW CRAPE-NUTS FOOD
..IS CONSTRUCTED.
Grape-Nuts food Is made by taking
the portions of Barley and Wheat con-
taining the nutritive elements, sub-
jecting the different parts to different
forms of treatment, and finally blend-
ing them in the proper proportions.
When ready for the market it is In
the form of small granules from the
size of a pin head to two or three
times that size. These pieces glisten
when held to the light, showing the
grape sugar crystallized and deposited
on each granule. This grape sugar is
one of the most nutritive articles of
food known, and is produced and
evolved from the starchy part of the
grains while in process of manufac-
ture.
No Gane or Beet Sugar is used in
making Grape-Nuts.
The flavor is a very delicate sweet,
and the food itself is crisp and dell-
cious.
Being fully cooked at the factory,
no preparation is required, but it is
ready to be served Instantly with a
little cream or milk, either hot or cold.
A marked increase .in mental
strength is found after 10 days' use of
Grape-Nuts.
The food contains elements which
nature uses to rebuild the cellular
tissue of the brain. ".:'?-" ; "
All flrst-cla?s â¢ grocers sell Grape-
Nuts at 15 cents per package.

| COMPLIMENTS INTERCHANGED
! SPECIAL TRAIN TO TAKE THE
MEN TO SALT LAKE.
The Utah volunteers were paid oft and
i mustered out yesterday, and to-day they
will start for Salt Lake. The paymaster
i came yesterday afternoon and after once
; fitting dawn to business it did m>t take
; him Jong to wind up the military cartf-rs
iof the batterymen. Each man was hand
; ed his discharge as he wn.* given his
â¢; money, and ha left the camp kitchen,
i where the paymaster had established
I himself, a free man.
Before 3 o'clock every man had been
paid and discharged and the cars to the
city were filled with men eager to spend
part of their pay. Discipline was a thing
of the past and every man was free to do
! just as he pleased. It was announced
I that those who wished could remain In
; camp another night, and many took ad-
I vantage of this â  permission, but the
: greater number made for the city at once
; and the Presidio saw them no more.
Each man received two months' pay
two months' extra pay allowed by Con
gress and the balance due on his clothing
account, besides travel pay to his home in
Utah. It' amounted to about $100 for each.
â  The pay of the officers lor three months
! was held back untfl their accounts shall
; have been verified.
The only unpleasant feature of the mus
ter out was the treatment of Major Grant
:by the pay department of the army. He
was tola that the orders were 10 pay him
i only a captain's travel pay from here to
I Salt Lake, as the paymaster general had
' decided that as he commanded only two
â¢ batteries he could not draw the travel pay
of a major, who should command tour.
The fact that the major wears the gold
j leaves, of a full major and that in the or
: ganization of the Utah Artillery It was
1 ordered that it be commanded bya major
was not considered. Neither was it con
sidered that for a long time Major Grant
commanded troops enough in the Philip
pines to form the command of a lieuten
< ant colonel: nor was his service thought
I of. It was ordered that he be allowed
1 only a captain's travel pay. and that was
' all he received. The major's wrath arose
not over the difference in the pay, which
amounts to but very little, but in the
smallness of the decision. He says the
Government is welcome to the- extra
money.
Before Major Grant left camp he was
! visited by Lieutenant Scott, adjutant of
1 the Pennsylvania Regiment, who carried
Colonel Barnett's compliments and an
offer of the escort of the Pennsylvania
Regiment If the Utah men Intended to
march down to the ferry to-day. The
i compliment was a most delicate one, for
the Pennsylvanlans and the Utahans are
| old comrades. There will bo no parade,
i however, and Major Grant could only ex
press his appreciation of the courtesy. He
! sent word to Colonel Barnett that he felt
I deeply grateful for the offer to escort
: and he thanked the Pennsylvania Regi
â  ment for Its exhibition of comradeship.
! Lieutenant Scott had hardly gone when
i word came from the Nebraska Regiment
â  that it would furnish a guard for the
camp and over all baggage left there last
night. This left the Utah men free to
go and come as they pleased without
anxiety for their effects. The offer was
gratefully accepted.
The only plan of the artillerymen is to
meet this afternoon at the ferry. Major
Grant expects every man to be at tne
ferry building at 2:30 p. m., so as to be
in plenty of time to catch the 3 o'clock
boat for the Oakland mole. There the
special train will be in waiting and It
will leave as soon after {he landing of
the 3 o'clock boat as the men can be got
aboard.
Tuesday night the Pennsylvania men
visited the Utah men and spent the even
| ing. A tremendous bonfire was kindled
j In the middle of the company street and
! the men of both commands Bat around It
j and swapped yarns and told stories and
1 sang songs and cheered. II was 11 o'clock
before they all turned In.

THE Filipino artors at the Mechanics*
Pavilion held a rehearsal yesterday
afternoon in order to get themselves
in trim for the opening of their show
at the Pavilion this evening. The tumb
lers tumbled, the band played its best
and every one in the company took a turn
at his or her specialty to overcome any
awkwardness the long journey from home
might have caused.
There are pixty-flve Filipinos in the
company, forty-six of whom are trained
performers or musicians. They came in
some days apo on the Leelanaw to be on
hand for the opening of the Mechanics'
Fair, in which they will appear, but they
dislike to wait so long before showing the
public what they can do, so it was ar
ranged to have them give exhibitions for
the remainder of this week, commencing
to-night. They will also appear in the
benefit performance in aid of the recep
tion fund to be given in the Alhambra.
Every one in the company is a native
Filipino.
The attractions which are expected to
arouse the greatest Interest are Francisco
Luna, the Filipino "Tod Sloan"; Emilio
de la Cruz, the strong man, and Eslaba
Muyot, the little acrobat. "Tod Sloan"
is 8 years old. He will ride in the athletic
exhibition. The strong man is but 10.
Senorita Eslaba is not much older, and
she Is just as interesting. She can turn
somersaults by the half dozen and she
can tie herself almost into a bow-knot
without the least trouble.
The company is the first of its kind to
come to this country. The members are
all good actors and aside from that they
have the distinction of beirjg the first of
their race to appear in public here.
SEWER COMMISSION
MAY BE RECREATED
MAYOR PIT EL AN AT WORK ON
A NEW SCHEME.
i
1 Mayor Phelan â  has *ot about repairing
: the mistake he made In prevailing upon
i the Board of Supervisors to create a
I Hewer Commission as a preliminary to
; the proposed bond issue for the construe*
i tion of a sewer system.
A week ago it was discovered by the
Auditor that the statutes do not empower
I the Board of Supervisors to create either
a board or commission for any purpose,
, but, on the contrary, gives it the right
i to appoint either an architect or an en
j ?rine<:r to superintend any public work.
The Mayor denied the Auditor's Interpre
â¢ tation of the law at first, but after a
! lengthy consultation and a study of thn
j statutes, agreed with him. The Sewer
Commission, as a result, was abolished
and only its expense bills were audited,
no back salary being paid.
Yesterday the Mayor submitted to the
Auditor the drafts of two resolutions and
asked him which of the two was satisfac
tory to him. One of them provided for
the appointment of C. E. Grunsky, one of
the erstwhile commission, as chief engi
! neer, at a salary of $4000. and bestowed
| upon him the right to employ two assist
ants at the same wage. It also allowed
, |8000 for any expense that might accrue
I The second simply appointed C. E. Grun
! sky engineer and allowed him $20,000 for
j expenses. It sajd nothing of assistants
whatever. .
Auditor Wells Is inclined to favor the
second resolution, as being more nearly
within the law, but he will submit both
to General Dickinson, his attorney, before
rendering any decision.

Captain Lamberth of the American ship

Two young men, sons of wealthy parents, ;
started out to see the world. Both fell by j
the wayside and became stranded In for- |
eign countries and far away from home.
Some good angel steered them across Cap
tain Lamberth's path, and during his last
voyage to Australia- and home again he
had both of them as cabin boys. One of I
them made the voyage to Australia and
at the end of the run had enough money
to take him home. The other came in on
the Wachusett from Sydney last Tuesday
and will start for his home in Washing
ton to-morrow.
The Wachusett left Puget Sound for
Australia In December last. Soon after
clearing Cape Flattery she was caught in
a heavy storm and began to leak. Captain
Lamberth wanted to continue the voyage.
but the crew refused to work the ship,
and he had to put in here. The vessel was
examined and found to be seaworthy, but
to make doubly sure the managing owner
put an extra steam pump and a windmill
on the lumber laden vessel. Some of the
crew deserted, among them being the cab

melted away In a short time, and the lad
was actually starving while his relatives
in Australia were living on the fat of the
land. Captain Lamberth shipped Frank
as cabin boy, and when the Wacnuaett
left Sydney, N. S. W.I he was back with
his relatives and doing well.
J. C. Gilmer came back on the â Wachu
sett as cabin bey. He has more fine rai
ment in his kit than any dude who does,
the line 0:1 Market street of an after
noon, and when be has them all on Soio
mon In all his gltvy would hot eclipse him.
Gilmer is 23 years old, and for two years
has been seeing tht world, and up to live
months ago had a splendid time. Upon
reaching his majority he came Into a con
siderable sum of money, and then the
State of Washington became too small for
him. He went to China, Japan, Hawaii,
New Zealand and finally landed in Syd- '
ney, N. S. W. He became fascinated with
Wooloomooloo, the "Barbary coast" of
Sydney, and there was robbed of his last j
cent. lie had not a cent when he ran
across Captain Lamberth, and would have
been put to sore straits if he had been
compelled to await a remittance from
home. Gilmer accordingly took the place
on the Wachusett vacated by !â¢ rank
Campbell, and reached port last Tuesday,
a sadder but a wiser man. His one de
sire now is to get home and settle down
for good.
On the voyage from Sydney to San
Francisco Captain Lamberth discovered .1
sunken rock that is not on the chart. It
was in latitude 32 degrees south, longitude
151 degrees west, and there were live or
six fathoms of water on it. The
Wachusett passed over the spot in safety,
but it would be particularly dangerous
in heavy weather to a deeply laden ves
sel coming here from Australia.
The transport Centennial will be made
â  ready to take a load of cavalry horses to
i Manila. She will go on the drydock about
I Saturday, and as soon as she Is over
i hauled her main and 'tween dicks will be
i fitted up with stalls for the cattle. â 
i The City.of Sydney will sail to-day with
â  about SSO recruits. The Siam will begin
I loading horses just as soon as they ar-
I rive and the hospital ship Relief will get
away about the end of the month.
â¢ The Board of Health will reopen the
. Harbor Hospital to-day. Drs. Robinson
and Dorr will be in charge, and Messrs.
Lily and McGlnnis will be the ambulance
I drivers and Miss Wynn and Mrs. Eddy
the matrons. Yesterday morning the
i Board of Health had everything in the
â  hospital moved out to the new City Hall
In order to Fpite the doctors who were
I trying to keep the place open without
, hope of fee or reward. Then when they
I discovered that they could open the place
i with their own appointees, all the goods
â  had to be moved back again. It was the
case of the "dog in the manger" over
again. The members of the Board of
Health were determined that if they
could not keep the Harbor Hospital open
nobody else should. Drs. yon der Leith
and Himmelsbach were willing to give
their services for nothing in order to
' look out for emergency cases on the
front, but the Board of Health threw
every possible obstacle in their way from
the start.
The Governor of Colorado and his staff
went for a cruise around the bay on the
State tug Governor Irwln yesterday. A
visit was paid to all the points of Interest
In the harbor, and during the afternoon
, the party was entertained by Captain
I Terry on the battle-ship lowa.

but there are considerable quantities to be sold
yet. On' the coast the markat "la reported quiet.
The supply has been reduced forty cars by a

crop continues, promising. It Is thought the
yield of the Santa Clara Valley will be larger
than last season. Sales of outside goods for
future delivery have been made at 2%c basis

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nezv York Stock Market.
j NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â The violent raid made
â upon, the values of securities by the bear ele
ment yesterday furnished material for its own
remedy in the shape of uncovered contracts on
the short side. .There was a fierce contest In
the early dealings to break prices further, the
bears continuing to center their attack on
Brooklyn Transit and the l<Â»cal traction stocks.
Other members of the group proved more vul
nerable than Brooklyn Transit, in which, power
ful support by. inside interest was forthcoming,
â while Metropolitan- Strtet Railway and Man
hattan yielded easily. The best efforts of the
bears only carried Brooklyn Transit a shade be
.low yesterday's figures, and friends of the stock
â¢were apparently ready to take all that was of
fered. The continuance of the aggressive bull
mowmeat in American Â»iha Continental To
bacco and strength In the United States Leath
er storks helped to the discomfiture of the early
'â¢benr movement... When appearances began to
â¢lndl.-ati; that the bear campaign was abortive
there was a movement to cover.- The strength
embraced a very limited portion of the general
list and the high-priced railway* continued ne
, elected and rather heavy. Railroads in the
southern ! region wore generally strong on the
â¢ rally pood business condition* and SndiiÃ
' trial expansion in that region. Louisville led
on account of report* of large current earnings
of that road and rose an extreme 1%. The
declaration <>( a 1 per cent dividend on Cheea-
I>eaku and Ohio Â«Â»â¢Â»â !;. the first in the history
of the present company, helped the movement.
Atchifioc preferred v.as strong on the reports
of ccntinnod largo cutttinK down at operating
expenses. â¢ The condition -of the money market
here shotted an easier tendency again and some
' New York banks were reported to be bidding
. for commercial paper Tor the first time in sev
eral weeks. Sterling: exchange rose In sym
pathy In spite of the ootitlnur-d hardening ten
dency of money In London. The late raid by
the bears to-day came "with the appearance of
realizing sales in the tobacco stock*. They at
tacked those itocfca. wiping â  oat the earlier
Ijainfi and forced Sugar denro to 15731 and. other
Jnd-ustrlals a less amount. Meantime Southern

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Aug. 16.â Wheat opened firm at a
..mall Improvement over yesterday's prices, !
September starting Ma to %a higher, at 7O l ,io
70V,c. Liverpool was again the motive. As
was the case yesterday the English market Ig
nored the action of wheat here, and Instead of
following yesterday's decline, showed a loss of
but %d and soon recovered this. Considerable
selling was done late In yesterday's session
on' the belief that Liverpool would be lower j
to-day, and the firmness caused a jnlld scurry- j
ing among shorts for cover. When this demand
had been satisfied prices sagged. The nuu-Ket
was exceedingly dull during the rest of the
morning, but stubbornly resisted several at
tempts to raid prices and acted a good deal
as ii it had l>een oversold. An explanation of
the firmness of foreign markets came In dis
patches from London to the affect that al
though some rain had fallen In India the pre
cipitation was altogether Insufficient to re
lieve the drought and famine was threatened In
many districts. In the afternoon the market
became more active. New York and St. Louis
pent liberal buying orders, and this demand
brought shorts Into the markets aeairi and re
sulted In a steady advance In the September
price from 70%@70%c to 71<571ViiC. This was
above the call price, and selling against those
privileges and a moderate amount of realiz
ing caused a reaction to 70%070%c. The close
was firm at that figure. December exhibited
more strength than September, though trading
in that future was comparatively small. It ad
vanced to T!,\~c. and closed %c hleher, at 73V*Â®
73% c.
Corn was devoid of speculative features, and
prices kept within a narrow range. Crop con
ditions continued favorable, and some cutting
of corn was rejx>rted from Kansas, but the
strength of wheat prevented any decline. Oats
wore firm with wheat, and on the better ship
ping demand September closed Me higher.
Provisions were dull and irregular. During
the morning prices declined all around on gen
eral liquidation, following a sharp break In
hog prices, pork being especially .weak. The
Â»hipp'.:i^ aemand was good, and this and the
strength of wheat brought about a rally later
In the day. The close was firm for lard and
ribs, but easy for pork. September pork closed
6c lower, lard fiHc higher and ribs 2Vic to 00
hls-h^r.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Aug. 18.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has slowed up somewhat during the
past week, although the volume of business has
reached a very good figure. Two factors have
been at work. The wool merchants have been
busily engaged in receiving, grading and de
livering wool and have had less time than usual
to think about effecting new transactions. On
the other hand manufacturers have been more
intent on their vacations than upon enlarging
their holdings of the raw material. Traveling
talesmen for the wool houses report that In In
numerable Instances they have been unable to
find mill proprietors, the latter being away at
the seashore or mountains. The buying hns
lately been largely of a hand-to-mouth char
acter, although there have- been several in
stances of transactions of considerable Inagnl-
tilde.
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
B.SM.OCH) pounds domestic and 130,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 6,118,000, against a total
of 6,891,009 for the previous week and a total
of 2,506,000 for the corresponding week last year.
Sales since January 1, 1899, amounted to 175,
--876,000 .pounds, against 74,393,510 pounds last
year at this time.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
Receipts of Hay continue too large and the
market is depressed, though there Is no de
cline except In . Alfalfa, which is coming In
more freely. The circular of Somers & Co.
says :
" "We can report no change In the situation
in any way; there Is a. large quantity of Hay
in all â¢ the hay districts yet to be marketed,
and the general idea is that if we see any
change in prices before winter it will be for the
worse rather than for the better.- The weather
has been threatening somewhat of late, and
the general opinion is that we will have early
rains. Should this be true there will be' much
Hay damaged, for at the rate it is now be
ing pressed it will be well into the rainy sea
son'before it is all out of the fields.
"The southern market has been investigated
more thoroughly of late, and the report comes
to us that their crop* by no means as short
as .was originally expected. There, seems to be
a general idea down ! south that should they
have to go elsewhere for a portion of their
supply they will naturally I turn toward Ari
zona, freiglfta being considerably cheaper from
that State than from our section of country."

Deciduous, and Citrus Fruits.
There are Indications that the worst of the
glut Is over. The canners crawled out of their
holes yesterday and bought a few stray lots
here and there, but they purchased with cau
tion and at low prices. There was still an
unwieldy mass of miscellaneous fruit on the
market, but what with the peddlers, swill
carts and dumping Into the bay a good deal
of inferior and decayed fruit has been gotten
rid of during the past two or three days. There j
still remain, however, something like 1000
boxes of Peaches on the dock to be dumped.
Bartlett Pears sold to dryers as low as $3 per
ton, but at the same time several lots of green ;
stork brought as high as $30. Cling Peaches
i Bold at $sÂ©lo per ton, and in several Instances
at $20 But It will lake some days yet to
fully get rid of the glut, as there are large
supplies Of Peaches and Pears In basements
and cold storage. Next week, however, ought
to see a better market.
Fine Apples are doing better. Grapes are In
large supply and Blow. Melons continue plenti

THE STOCK MARKET.
Although there was a long list of tranactlons
on the Bond Exchange at the morning session,
the only fluctuation worthy of note was an ad
vance In Paauhau Plantation to $39 87%.
In the afternoon Oceanic sold up to $83 25
and Paauhau to $40. ;
Mining stocks opened easier and shaded off.
The telegram from the pump said: "At 6:30
this morning the water was 26 feet 6 Inches
below the 1950- fool level station. No. 1 eleva
tor has been working continuously. No. 2 will
be lowered Into position to-day and probably
started." .
Action on the' cheap electric power contract
has been deferred, in order that the different
companies may consider a proposition to erect
I their own plant.

The- trial of the divorce suit of Minnie
y Smith, against. Norman H. Smith
wa^ to ..have bt>en commenced to-morrow
rndrniiig. in Judge Ogden's court, but the ,
fatfji Of -the â  -tiff appearing as prose
cuting . -witness against A. Arlington, the ;
alleged V*fj&y bunkoer \ of. women, has ;
proved, the first obstruction to a speedy |
trial : k>f the divorce suit, which has ac
cordingly gone over. -
â  In- Judge. Hails court to-day, before a
iurv.Mrs, J?:ruth again recitod many of
tW-- smooth -ways in which the gay de
ceiver, bunkoed her out of $2\Â«>. By her
Arlington w;is known as J. W . r ansn,
arid- by the latter name he had been in
t-cx3uced to Mrs. Smith by Mrs. J. H.
Heim at the. Merritt Hduse. Arlington
had represented himself to be a capital- ;
ist -who wished to purchase a house here.
Hi"? ia<.-a was to engr.ge a housekeeper to
care :or- him ar.d a daughter, whom he
claimed -afthe time was in Los Angeles.
Mrs Sm : ith had be*r. introduced to him
&Â«'â¢â & suitable housekeeper, and she was
captivated with his smooth .and polished
r - mjl^era She practically accepted the
vr'-.v-otition and the couple incidentally
looked about for suitable furniture. Then j
Â£hey went on a jaunt to Blair Par*.
s^heT* circus lemonade was ordered by
th* prospective lord of the proposed man
s:vn but v.lien it came to the point ut
joying for the refreshment Arlington
f.^k: ?d lack of chunge. and induced Mrs.
SsiriH to part with her purse, containing
j^m-v- Tre next day be returned the
pursei keeping the' money, ar.d later the
couple- -enjoyed a French dinner and a
trip' to Haywards. After that he disap
peared, .although he had promised to re
fund the. money. â  ' ,
The: defense to-day introduced a letter
â¢u-niline to Incriminate Mrs. Smith, but
this' n-istle will probably prove a decided
boomerang. The letter is address^ to J.
SV? Farish, Esq.. Russ House. 3. F., none
other than Arlington. and it reads:
"Thursday;! must see you. If you. come .
Dvc-r.svrnd for mi-. 'Am in devp trouble
Pleasg grant me this favor. ihe letter
i< -=is"e<i "Maud."'
â¢7 To t-V introduction of this note the
prosecution objected, but Mrf. Smith was
afterward allowed to ex-plain that it had
bfen written, rot- by her. but with her
consent by Mrs. Sarah Wutktns under ad
vice Of. the detective authorities of san
Francisco, its object being to induce Ar
lir."tci-i to come to Oakland, whore a war
rant for his arrest had already been is- .
sued.- It was. in brief, a aecoy letter,
â¢but", there had been no replj It was
found- on. Arlington: at the time of his ar
ri l"' the absence of Mrs. tains. who
Â£Â»< been sent for and who is expected up
iTem Santa Barbara to-night, the trial
was** continued early this afternoon untu

; . Ift =the meantime Arlington is still in the

DR. HERRICK'S CASE LAGS
GUESSING AT SENTENCE OF
THOSE PLEADING GUILTY.
Meanwhile, the Only Sufferer Is the
Black Boy Who Was Induced to
Fight and Who Is Still
in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, --.p. 16.
"We proved beyond the venture of
a doubt that there was a prizefight; that
the spectators paid for admission: that
It was held in ratter's basement with his
knowledge and consent; that there, was
a pur?- : that blows were struck. and that
one man was knocked out. And yet that
jury In the Police Court acquitted Gat
ter."
Such was the expression of Captain of
Police Peterson when he heard of the
verdict In the case of Fred Gatter,
charged with b-Mng present at a â â right.
The whole affair has been turned into
a farce. As Cast as juries can be ob
tain.- . the people charged with being pres
ent or participating in the recent prize
light are being discharged, although in
some cases the police and the prosecu
tion put in testimony which they consid
ered a3 absolutely convincing.
Judge Smith was asked this afternoon
what would be the result of all the dis
charges of defendants by a jury in the
cases of the two men. Archie rmien
and George' Green, who have pleaded
guilty to being bottle holder and second.
The Judge declined to discuss the matter,
but - thai while it was in the province
of the defendants to ask to be permitted
to change their plea, it was also In bis
province to give or withhold the required
permission.
Tills af -.ernoon the case of Dr. L. 1".
Herrick was set for trial. The doctor was
present, both his attorneye were in court
and the venire was in the lobby. The
doctor is credited with being referee at
the light and one of the principals,
Musa Bryam, invited the doctor to at
tend, and" this excuse the doctor has al
ready given for being present. Some one
who seemed to understand the situation
wa.Â« making bets that the case would not
go on despite the fact that all were pres
ent and ready. The bet.s wire quite safe,
for after a consultation between all con
cerned the case of Dr. Herrick was laid
over until to-morrow morning and an
other case was called. Up to date six
out of about twenty oases have been â  --
missed and there- seems to be little hope
of securing a conviction. Should those
who have pl.aded guilty be not allowed
to change their pleas the prizefight will
leave on the Police -Court records some
peculiar comparisons.
Musa Bryam, the little black fellow who
was Induced to go into the fight, has been
unkindly allowed to be the only one of
the crowd to languish in jail, no one
bhowing enough sympathy for the boy
to put up a bond for his release.

TROUBLES OF THE McNALLYS.
Serious Fracas Besults From Differ
ences Concerning a Bath.
The McN'allys aired their troubles be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday, arid the
Judge felt so confused after listening to
their stories that he said he would take
till Saturday to endeavor to unravel the
tangle.
It seemed that Mrs. Kate McXally, a
widow, living at 272 Xatoma street, called
upon her brother-in-law, James McXally,
232 Xatoma street, on Saturday night,
August 5, with her two children. While
there the widow pave "Willie, her elder
boy, 25 cents to go to the L,urllne Baths to
get a bath. James McN'ally objected and
told Willie to keep the money and he
would give him as good a bath as he
could get anywhere for nothing. He got
out the bathtub and filled it with hot
water. The widow objected to James
bathing Willie, and after some angry
words she seized a poker and hit James
over the head with it. James' wife. Mag
gie, struck the widow a violent blow In
the eye and the widow seized a butcher
knife and hurled it at Maggie, striking
her over the eye.
John Maloney. the widow's brother-in
law, hearing the noise, looked In and
then ran for a policeman. When the offi
cer entered the tub had been overturned
and the place looked like a slaughter
house. James and the widow were each
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon and Maggie was charged with
battery. They all declared In court that
they had shaken hands and wanted the
cases dismissed.

REV, DR, LAW
STILL SAYS HE

issues a Denial in
New York.
"NO RESIGNATION" HIS CRY
DR. WILLIAMS MAY BE HIS
SUCCESSOR.
Trustees of Church of the Advent
Hold a Document That They Assert
Is a Resignation, in â¢ Spite
of All Statements.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
503 Broadway, Aug. 15.
All the way from New York comes an
other denial from Rev. Marshall Law, late
of the Church of the Advent. The ex
rector had been quoted in a New York
paper as having resigned from an Oak
land church: The rector demanded a con
tradiction and stated very forcibly that
he had not .resigned.
This information has reopened the old
breach at the Church of the Advent. Ne
gotiations are being carried on with Epis
copalian ministers looking to a successor
for the late rector, and they are likely to
be hampered by the recent denial from
Dr. Law that he has resigned. Dr. Will
iams of New York is one of the rectors
with whom the Church of the Advent is
in correspondence, and who was surprised
to find in the newspaper that there was
no vacancy in Oakland. Dean Jackson of
Salt Lake City is also considered an avail
able candidate, but the church .cannot pro
ceed according to ecclesiastical law to
name a rector until the previous incum
bent has formally resigned. .
When Dr. Law went East, with three
months' salary in his pocket and his fare
paid, he left a written agreement by
which, on condition of certain things be
ing done by the church, he would present
his resignation some timte prior to October
1. This agreement was made in triplicate,
the rector, the Bishop and the church
trustees each having a copy. The trustees
declare that it is itself a prima facie res
ignation, but it does not comply with the
letter of the church law, and in view of
Dr. Law's recent statement in New York
the trustees .are not quite sure where they
stand.
Evidently Dr. Law does not consider his
agreement as a resignation or as binding.
The church trustees declare that they
have tilled all the terms imposed upon
th^m by the rector prior to his going
East, and should Dr. Law insist on con
sidering himself rector of the Advent,
Church an appeal will be made to the
Bishop, and altogether new grounds will
be taken on which to base a demand for
the. rector's retirement.
J. J. Valentine's resignation a? vestry
man has not yet been accepted, and much
hope is expressed that he will reconsider
it now that Dr. Law ha? gone. No effort,
however, will be made to induce Mr. Val
entine to return- to. the church until the
bona fide indisputable legal resignation of
the late rector is in the hands or" the trus
tees.

One Tragedy Led to
Another.
STEINSON LEFT AN ESTATE
MET DEATH IN THE BAY AT
PORT COSTA.
Had He Lived a Pew Weeks Longer
He Would Have Married and
Scottish Heirs Would Not
Be Enriched.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
MB Broadway, Aug. If..
Papers just filed in the Superior Court
bring to light a story of how an estate lias
been diverted by the drowning last fall of
James Stelnson oi East Oakland.
Steinson. wai in the employ of the rail
road company and had acQUired a ne.it
little fortune in money and real esi
He was engaged to be married to Micss
McClOre of Â£a?t Oakland, but prior to
time fixed for the wedding h< -
Port Costa and met with r.is d^ath hi
drowning. One tragedy led to another,
for three days later nis prospective m
er-in-law was, so overcome tÂ»y Stei:;
death that she died suddenly, just an
hour before the remains of her daughter's
sweetheart were brought into the huu.-e
from which the I :-..â¢ r v wafl to take place.
Steinson left no will Â«'r :t would have
been reasonably certain to suppose that
his intended wife would have received a
generous share of his estate. The prop
erty came under the jurisdiction of tne
Public Administrator, and heirs
found in Scotland, but none in this cou;i
try. Steinson left BaiifTshire many years
ago, gr>ing first to Queensland and later
coming to America. He was of a thrlity
disposition and accumulated about JWOO
in local banks, besides a few pieces of real
estate.
When it was proved that he left no will
the estate was probated, and several
months were occupied in obtaining all the
necessary data from his brother John in
Scotland to prove that John and five chil
dren f>f another brother were the so'.e
heirs to the estate. It was at first thought
that some arrangement might be found by
which a portion of the estate would pass
to Miss McClure. but as Steinson had evi
dently not anticipated any accident prior
to his marriage, no such proof of his in
tention existed.
A petition of the heirs authorized by
them from their Scottish home has j\;3t
been received by Attorney Darwin de Go
lla, and in a few weeks the estate of the
unfortunate Suin=<->ri will be legally dis
tributed to the heir?.
INTERESTING
AS SOME JET
BLACK CALLA
TOLSTOI'S opir.i'-T.s are often irri
tating. He says that what is int< r st
ing i? not art. but if he haÂ« "Hedda
Gabler" ;oul the like in miml he is
right. Th" province of art should be to
ite, not deera-ie. Perhaps his whole
attitude is more nearly right than we
think. It c-rtainly is if he means to keep
the si* 1 ' ules of mii'lern rancid oil out of
his bruin. Fr<rri the standpoint of the
actor. Ibsen has written a great play, and
- i vi=-ry great one. But what
.. â¢!< I i-v.il-.'-v, of renlus. interesting, fas
cinating it la aa the jet black calla, whose
\ odor is deathly. The morgu^ is an inter
esting place, yet horrible, for" the bodies
there sha. r:h and rot.
H- .Ma Gabk r. Eflert Lovbofg and As-
r Brack are living yet rotting, and
it is such a suave, absorbing, interesting
rottenness. The vulgarities in the play
are good. Th>- re should be more. It should
be vulgar. It is just the dash of sour
sauce that should season such a joint.
If you are Puritan enough to believe as
you read the book that no such beautiful,
morbid human warp, as Hedda Gabkr
could exist, you had best keep away from
the play. You will not go through the
experience with Miss Bates in the role and
come out just as you started. She will
never do anything better than the last
;icts of the play. In them she is not
Miss Bates; she is the puppet of Ibser.,
and the creature of his brain moves and

There are but ashes in the mouth when
the curtain falls. Mr. Hlckman came on
with the Hickman voice, but soon made
us forget It. his grasp of the character
of Assessor Brack was so firm. He is pot
a strong actorâ always seems a fop when
cast as a soldierâ but hÂ«Â» is a born sneerer,
and as Brack was artistically out of him
self and in the play. Mary Van Buren
looked Mrs. Elosted. and was good but
crude. She intentioned right, out she
lacks exp- rienee. Mr. Frawley as Lov
borg meant to give the idea of" something
unusual, intense â that these were the
greatest two or three days that God ever
created. The idea was a good one and
successfully expressed. Yet he was not

Preparations for the
Annual Fete.
DECORATIONS ARE ELABORATE
PRIZES FOR THE MOST ARTISTIC
ILLUMINATION.
All the Water Craft in That Portion
of the Bay Will Take Part
In the Corning Car
nival.
Belvedere's fete on the 16th of Septem
ber giv^s promise of being a brilliant car
nival on the waif-r? of the bay. The cove,
in which the attendant ceremonies are to
be held, will be illuminated with electric
lights and also by searchlights of great
power, bringing oui all the varied beau
ties of the scene.
For a central idea the promoters of the
carnival have chosen the form of the an
cient public celebrations held in Venice.
ThÂ« concluding scene of this is the
riage of the Adriatic." In this the Doge,
head of the Venetian government, es
pouses the sea. by throwing a gulden ring
into the wat-r. Tht- Doge will be ;:
sonated by Frank Thompson, w
stature makes him an imposing rigur
will he conveyed to the scene on an elab
orate â â  â¢ _.:ey and will be sur
rounded by Senators, Princes. EmbaFsa
dors. sailors and others. These wi
handsonu-- ; mcd, adding to the
brilliancy of the scene.
Previous to this ceremony there will be
an impressive water pageant, participated
in by the boats of the Corinthian Yacht
and other craft illuminated a:. I
orated with gay bunting. They will ap
proach in two columns, and. uniting, will
be preceded by the galley of the Doge to
the center of the cove. The galley will
anchor here and the fleet will pass in r~
flew.
The climax will come with the throwing
of the ring into the water. A submarine
mine will be exploded, throwing a gre^t
volume of water into the air. Fireworks
will be se r . off and searchlights centered
upon the scene. An ode has been written
tor the occasion and will be rendered by
a chorus of thirty-five male voices.
Prizes have bet.n offered by J. H. Keefe,
Hugo D. Keil and others for the best il
luminated bouse, yacht, sloop and row

FRITZ SCHEEL WILL
COME IN SEPTEMBER
PLANS ALREADY FORMED FOR
THE SYMPHONY SEASON."
Musicians Ask "for. More "Wagesâ A
â  New Hall Must Be Selected â So
ciety Will Meet Soon.â â¢" =
There has beer, considerable discussion ol
late as to the leadership of the symphony
orchestra next season, caused by the re
port that Fritz Seheel was about to ac
cept the position of conductor to th?
Philadelphia symphony orchestra, raado
vacant by the resignation of W. W. Gil
christ. This question will be settled when
it is known that Sebeel will return on
September 26, - for the presence 01 Scheel
will throw every other aspirant for the
position into the shade. A letter was re
ceived by a member of the Symphony So
ciety yesterday from Mr. â¢ Redemann", the
flautist of the symphony orchestra, \*ho
went East with Scheel, in which it is
stated that Scheel will return on the 2â¬th
: of next month. i
When questioned about the plans of the
Symphony Society for next season one of
the directors stated that a meeting will
be held presently and. definite plans Will
be arranged. However, the idea is to give
again a series of eight concerts, if pos
sible more. Those subscribers who sup
ported the concerts so liberally last sea
son will again be. approached, and there
is no doubt that the financial success will
be a great .one, â especially since Scheel
will resume. the leadership.
Some difficulty must. however, be settled
first. It seems that the musicians object
to the $5 compensation and contend that
they are entitled to more salary. In
view of this complaint the union decided
to raise the remuneration for symphony
| concerts. Whether the society will con
sent to this increase is a question which
will have to be settled at the next meet
ing. .
In view of the fact that the symphony
concerts have proved an important factor
in the advancement of musical science in
San Francisco and or. the Pacific Coast it
is hoped by music-lovers that no effort -will
be spared to renew the series of concerts
and that the public will readily support
this good cause cannot be doubted.
Another question to be settled is that of
a hall. It is understood that the Orpheum
cannot be had for next season, and some
of the directors are thinking- of acquiring 1
the Alhambra Theater, which' seems to
be the only available place for' the pres
ent. It makes hardly any difference
where the symphony concerts are held
They will always draw a crowd as long
a* an efficient leader is at the director's
i desk. . . .
IN THE SHERIFF'S CUSTODY.
Patrick Xeenan Jury Will .Be Pro
tected From , Outside Influences.
Patrick Keenan, belter known as Patsy
Hogan. ex-prizefighter and fireman, who
on October 19 last, murdered his wife in
their home on Olive avenue, near Van
Ness, was placed on trial for his life be
fore Judge Dunne yesterday. The work
of securing a jury progressed rapidly and
at time of adjournment eleven- jurors had
been secured. They are M. Burns Wil
liam H. Tilsen. George R. Richmond. J. H.
Dan ton. Nathan Nason. John Noorian, W.
G. Ryder. Harry T. Bray. P. McGowan O.
Christensen and J. L. Markel. The re
maining juror will, in ail probability, be
secured to-day. â  '
As soon as the eleven men selected had
been sworn Judge Dunne sprung a sur
prise on them. He ordered them into the
custody of the Sheriff until the end of the
trial. Judge Dunne later said .that there
was no particular reason for ordering the
jury into the custody of the Sheriff and he
did not now wish this impression to be cir
culated, and said, that his action was
caused solely by hts opinion that in nearly
j all capital cases the jury should be pro
! tected from possible outside influences.
i The jury reluctantly followed the Sheriff
I to a near-by hotel where ail will board
I and lodge until Koran's fate has been de
| termined. . = â¢
Threatened to Lynch Him.
Charles Earr.es. a driver for Dr. Mc-
Donald. 32 O'Farreli street, had an un
pleasant experience yesterday afternoon.
Some one had taken the bit out of tha
horse's mouth. vA as Eames was driv
ing across Stccktor and Market streets
Mrs. Annie Krohn of 314 Ash avenue, who
wp.= carrying a baby in her arms, was
knocked dowr. by the horse. Eames being
unable to pull the animal up. Mrs. Krohn
was taken into Kelly's drugstore, where
I it was found that she had escaped with
' a few bruises, while the baby was unln
j Jured. Some one in the crowd that had
1 gathered shouted that the baby was kill
! Ed and there was a cry of "lynch him."
Ean~.Â°s was so scared that he was seized
' with an epileptic fit and was taken to the
I Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon
by Policeman McGrayan. He Boon re
covered and Captain SpHiane, after hear
ing the circumstances, allowed him to go
1 home.

EICKHOFF BACKS
UP HIS CHARGES
Presents an Array of
Facts and Figures.
OVEREDUCATION OF CHILDREN
BUT A SMALL PERCENTAGE GO
TO THE UNIVERSITY.
Claims Money Is Being Wasted by
an Elaborate Course of Instruc
tion in the Marin High
Schools.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Aug. 18.â Attorney
! Henry Elckhoff's declaration that Hunt
| Iqgtofl was rigljt when he said that it waÂ«
! folly "to expend $1 in the education of a
I 10-cent child," and that the local school
trustees have "gone education mad," has
stirred up a hornet's nest. Eickhoff. who
is a member of the Board of Town Trus
tees, nicks manfully to his Runs, and
shows facts and figures to back up his
j assertions^.
In conference with the School Board
| Eickhoff claimed that at an expense of
$6000 only ten pupils had graduated from
the High School last year, and that the
course or" study prescribed wag such that
the :najcrlty of the pupils were being
held buck in order that the requirements
of a few might receive special attention.
The howls of Indignation resulting from
this language are due to a representation
j that Eickhoffs language was intended to
I cast approbium upon the graduates. This
i interpretation, he says, is manifestly un
-1 fair .and that his meaning was that a
preparation for the university should not
be given children who could- never go to
the university, and would certainly make
| a failure of it if they did. While he be
: lieves in a business education for children
: who will not advance higher than a high
| school. Trustee Eickhoff critized in un
nriisured terms the establishment of a
commerclaJ class In tho High School, with
a teacher salaried at $75 a month, while
the c chool finances are in so tangled a
I condition.
The school appropriation for the next
fiscal year was reduced from SS4SS to
; $7000. with the understanding that $6000
'. will suffice for the year following.
In addition the board finds fault with
] Bently because he hears only thirteen reci
tations a week, while Professor Larsen,
! the professor to German and Latin, has
â  to hear thirty-fi\ â¢â¢.
Another phase of the situation is that
thr> blackboards recently placed in the
school had to be nailed to the wall be
', cause they were of too inferior a (juality
glued. Contractor Oge tried at an
i early hour to get them ready for inspec
: ti"n. but failed, and the board has re
fused to pay balance due on his con
tract until the blackboards are finished
.according to FDecineations.

Rapids and the telegrapher? prefer St.
Louis. The trainmen will go to Cleveland.

burned.
While the city has been preparing to go

CLOSED THEIR PURSES
AGAINST THE FUND
Finance Committee Meets With
Some Flat Refusals From
Unexpected Sources.
! Some people have not contributed to the
â  reception fund according to thoir means,
and some who have been solicited have
i flatly refused to add a cent to the sum
which is being raised to honor the home
coming of the California soldiers. The
1 finance committee announced yesterday
that the following had refused to yield to
: the persuasions of the soliciting comrntt
! tee: Sutter^treet Railroad Company,
which stated that it had not contributed
â  a cent to anything .in fifteen years;
; ACaisoa Rlche, Thomas Magee and Komp
i key, (Jilhiim & Sawyer, one of the mer
' chants of the wholesale district contrib
uted a dollar and the committee voted to
return It to htm, as it was thought that
jhe probably needed It more than those
In charge of the reception.
It is roughly estimated that the Arion
! benefit will net about $1200 over and above
! the necessary expenses, which were In
; the neighborhood of $500.
The- committee received the following
telegram from Pauline Miller Weinschenk,
dated at Chicago:
"Sent you contribution of $5 to-day for
lour glorious Boldier boys. Shall always
i remain loyal to California and its gen
'â¢ erous hearted people. "
PREPARATIONS FOR

The Statf officials and shipping m^n
along the water front were jubilant yes
terday at the action of the fireworks
committee in allowing them $10n0 for a
night exhibition on the bay when the < â  n 1 1 _

SCENE FROM "THE NEW DOMINION" AT TO-DAY'S BENEFIT.
Increase of the appropriation of $750 for
the fireworks to the larger sum, and their
efforts were crowned with success.
The contractors who are stringing the
electric lamps for the night decorations
had a dozen men at work on the ferry
building yesterday, and a number of the
columns at' the top of the tower were
strung with the lamps. Several electric
stars were placed in position and some- j
thing very artistic In the way of elec
trical decoration has been evolved.
Inside the building the arches in the
grand nave are being fitted up with tulip
colored lamps in red. white and blue, and
the Native Daughters who have kindly I
assumed charge of this feature are work- j
ing industriously. Head Electrician I
Throll turned on the colored lights last
night and the effect was beautiful. The
word "welcome," built entirely of electric
lights, will face the volunteers from the
north and south windows.
A carload of ferns and fir trees arrived
yesterday, and will be used to cover the In
terior marble pillars of the building, while j
the broad keystones will be graced by the
national colors and shields. American |
and bear flags will be hung in profusion '<
and two huge bears made out of appro
priate material are to be suspended at
each end of the nave.
Sanborn. Vail & Co. purchased 300 tick
ets for the Ukiah excursion and will give
ISO of their employes a half-holiday when
the California volunteers arrive. There !>â â 
a large demand for tickets and the Har
bor Commissioners are anxious to secure ,
additional boats to handle the crowds that i
will witness the naval parade.
Assistant Chief Wharfinger George H. j
S. Dryden. chairman of the committee on I
noise, received notice from the San Matec
and the Presidio and Ferries roads that
the steam whistles will blow from theii i
respective powerhouses at Thirtieth and
San Jose avenues and on Union street
when the transport Sherman is sighted.
Mr. Dryden desires to announce the ar
rival of the California volunteers in every
part of the city.
COMPANY M SWELLS
THE BREAKFAST FUND
Rousing Benefit at Ellis Street
Armory Which Netted Many
Welcome Dollars.
Out at the armory at R3Ti Ellis street
last niprht there was a great big enter
tainment and dance given for the benefit
of the California Volunteer breakfast
fund. It was given under the auspices of
Company M of the First Regiment and
was a rpusing success from start to
finish. As a result of the crowd that
packed the armory hall to the doors the
breakfast fund will be materially in
creased when an accounting Is made to
day.
The arrangements for tho affair fell for
the most part on the shoulders of Mrs.
Florence Lawton, and although it was her
maiden effort at anything of the 'sort
there was not one detail overlooked.
Qraeber's mandolin orchestra of thirty
pieces volunteered its services, and not
only furnished music for th^ entertain
ment but for the dance which followed.
The hero of the First Nebraskas, Wil
liam C, Grayson, the man who killed the
first Filipino and tired the opening shot
of the present unpleasantness, appeared
on the stag* during the evening, and
Bcaroe got a chance to tell his story of
that event so loud and lung was the
cheering. The programme, every number
of which was excellently rendered, w-as ad
follows:

PLENTY OF WORK FOR
RETURNING VOLUNTEERS
Patriotic Merchants Will Re-employ
the Californians Who
Enlisted.
No anxiety nred he felt by the parents
and friends of the members of the First
California Volunteers that they will be
without positions when they return to
their homes. When the brave young men
who compose the famous regiment enlist
ed many of their employers, imbued with
tho same patriotism manifested by their
employes, publicly expressed their inten
tion of holding open the positions va
cated by them on entering the army. Some
of the more generous promised to turn
over half-pay to the families of the men
during their absence, and many firms car
ried out these promises. There is not a
doubt in the mind of any person acquaint
ed with the facts that an application for
a position from one of the California he
roes would be denied by the patriotic
merchants of this city.
As an indication of the high regard in
which the returning volunteers are held
by their respective employers, The Call
herewith gives the names of a number of
corporations and firms who have posi
tions waiting for the defenders .of the
flag. The Union Iron Works has a number
of representatives in the regiment and
they will return to their occupations as If
they were but on a vacation. Every em
ploye of the Southern Pacffie system who
enlisted and who is able to work will be
provided for on his return. The Telephone
Company has provided places for its rep
resentatives, as has also the Market
street' Railway Company, Lebenbaum's.
