"It on the third Tuesday after the or

has received such majority, then on that

Father Guilherme Gloria. Pastor of St. Joseph's
Church of Oakland, Mao Resigned to
Wed Publicly His Contract Wife,
Love Romance of a Young Cleric and Miss Annie B Collins
Reaches a Climax and a Startling Denouement
OAKLAND is . the â  - scene of a [
, sensation v/hich in its varied j
i and dramatic elements. In its :
romance and in its tragic do- i
mestic incidents is perhaps j
without paral'eF on the coast, j
The Pvev. Father Guilherme Gloria, j
pastor of St. Joseph's Portuguese !
Church, has promised that to-night '
he will, for the second time, make Miss
Annie B. Collins his wife and in the
marriage make partial reparation for
the injury he has inflicted upon her
ar.d atrne for the injustice he has done
to his baby son.
The love story of the handsome, bril
liant paster of St. Joseph's and the ;
pretty dressmaker of the Davis block .
is an Interesting one. There were few !
in the priest's congregation that knew
the secret. There were few of these
that flocked every Sunday morning into
the Chestnut-street sanctuary to listen
to their ------- words, guiding
them into paths of virtue, who knew
that the frail, sweet-faced, dainty little
woman who heeded with rapt attention
was the priest's wife and the baby boy
with her his son.
But if Father Gloria keeps his prom
ise to his contract ire the secret will
be out to-night. The priest has re
signed his pastorate and will violate his
priestly vows. He will start again- in
a new field and hopes that he may win
success. Nearly eight years ago he
was married by contract to the woman
who has since sustained the responsi
bility of motherhood without the dig
nity of wifehood. Time and again her
priestly husband sought to compromise
between honor and humiliation. He
wanted to take the girl away to a place
anywhere from California and there be
gin anew. He wished to marry her
openly and to clothe her with the wifely
dignity that was her right.
He had provided- for her and within
his means had protected her, but he
could not give her his name. It was
this and nothing less that the girl de
manded and she would not go away.

CUPID PLAYED HAVOC IN ST. JOSEPH'S PULPIT.
R-=v. FaithVr GaHlierme Gloria, pastor of St Joseph's Portuguese Catholic
Church of Oaklar.il. has created a sensation among his people. JLe has resigned
from his .jhurch. abandoned his pastorate and promised to marry publicly his
contract wife." Annie B. Collins. There has been an intimate relationship ex
isting between the priest and the woman for . eleven years. The intercourse
began when Miss Collins was fifteen years of age. In IS3I the contract mar
riage was made, and Father Gloria has promised that to-night a Justice of the
Peace shall pronounce i c words which will make the union public arfd in full
conformity to the laws. Nearly four years ago a son was born, and to-night if
the promise of the priest be kept will be a turning- point in the little fellow's
life. â  . â .
dramatic climax began eleven years
ago at San Leandro. ' At that time, the
young, handsome and brilliant priest :
came to take charge of the Portuguese
Catholic Church in the little town. He
had arrived shortly before that from
Brazil and was believed to be particu
larly well qualified by the Catholic au
thorities to direct the spiritual welfare j
of the Portuguese at San Leandro. Hi.
name 'was Guilherme Gloria. ;
The young priest rapidly won the con
fidence of his people. He was pious.
enthusiastic and sympathetic. He went
among the homes of his flock, minister- j
ing. encouraging and counseling. I
Among the members congrega
tiontion was Annie B. Collins., a pretty
\ girl, 15 years of age. Father Gloria
: took an unusual interest in her. He di
, rected her education and seemed to find
! unusual pleasure in her company. At
his suggestion, her mother transferred
her from a public school to a parochial
school. The priest and the girl were
, then much more than they had been in
each other's company.
It was then that the intimacy, which
now reaches its climax, began. Only
one member of' Annie Collins' family
knew of her close association â with the
handsome pastor. Miss Lizzie Collins,
-with a sister's intuition, discovered the
secret, accused her sister and was told
the facts. The relationship now be
tween the pastor and the girl were fully j
established and continued without in- j
terruption or change for two years.
The priest and his pretty penitent were .
lovers." Still the mother and father of j
Annie Collins j knew nothing of her i
daughter's infatuation and their pas
tor's indiscretion. .Late in IS3I affairs
had reached such a pass that for the]
girl's protection from absolute shame j
something desperate had to be done, j
There was but one way out of the diffl- j
culty and this was but a poor one. The j
handsome priest could not openly mar- j
ry the girl without sacriflclnÃ his j
priestly dignities and submitting to the j
public humiliation of being driven from j
' his pulpit unfrocked. It was decided.!
therefore, that a marriage contract
would be drawn up and on September
22, 1891, this was done.
The scruples of the girl were silenced
and the predicament of the priest was
evaded. As a measure of scill greater
precaution Annie Collins made her sis-
I ter Lizzie a witness of the marriage
{ contract. The priest arvd Annie signed
j the document as principals. Ever since
: then Annie Collins has treasured this
"piece of paper as the only certificate
which can protect her from public
shame. She has kept, it safely and has
J it yet, notwithstanding an effort to take
' it away from her.
About four years ago another crisis
came in the relations between the
priest and his contract child wife. It
j became imperative that the girl should
; leave her home and Father Gloria, re
j sourceful as ever, suggested an avenue
; through which Annie might expect to
j escape exposure and humiliation. The
priest was about to be transferred from
I his pastoral charge at San Leandro to
St. Joseph's Portuguese Catholic
Church on Chestnut street, between
Seventh and Eighth. He urged his
young contract wife to go with him.
but at the same time protect herself
from the wrath of her parents. â¢
He declared that he would establish
ber as a dressmaker in Oakland and
her parents could not then expect to
Bee her with any frequency. She would
! have a reasonable excuse for being
I away from home and she readily ac
cepted the proposition. Apartments
j were secured in the Kahn building in
! Oakland and a sign. "Annie B. Collins, :
Dressmaker," appeared in the window. i

HIS PRIESTLY CAREER
CLOSES IN DISHONOR

The young woman had few patrons and |

Some time ago Miss Collins removed
from the Kahn building to the Davis
block at 105" Washington street, Oak
land, where Bhe is now established as a
dressmaker. About a year ago she be
came restless, uneasy and dissatisfied
with her condition. Rumors were he
pinning: to float that she was not what
shÂ» represented herself t<> be, and that
th^ wedding ring upon her finger seem- j
ed odd in association with the prefix to
her name. She begged Father Gloria
to renounce his vows, resign his pas- !
torate and make her, in the view of
her family and friends, what Bhe was :
In secret hia w ife. .
The priest pleaded that he could not. j

outside of his pulpit. He agreed that if j
she would wait a while they would go j
away and be married and he would
start lif'^ over again under new condi
tions and in another land. To this she
would nm agree. She insisted that she j
must regain her honor among the peo- j
pie in whose opinion she had lost it.
Father Gloria in a measure yiejded to
her importunities. He attempted to
peek a new field, and applied to the |
authorities of Stanford University to j
give him a position as a teacher of lan- J
guages. He Is esteemed to be an accom

CANADIAN CUSTOM-HOUSE
MOVED BACK TO BENNETT CITY
Thp completion of thr> White Pass and Yukon Railway, allowing the funning
of trains through from tide water at Skaguay to the head of steamboat navi
gation I" 'ho Yukon basin, greatly lessens the hardship and Inconvenience "f
travel to the Klondike. One of. the tirst results has been the 'removal of the Ca
nadian customs station from its former location at the Log Cabin, just beyond
the boundary lini . as ctiinred by the United States' back to Bennett City, at the
head of Lake Bennett, between which point and Dawson there are regular
lines of steamers at frequent intervals. This change is one of much Importance
i" â¢â¢very one going into that country with mining outfits or goods for sale. Hen -
tofore they have been subjected to the inconvenience and delay of having to.
unpack and submit their goods to inspection at the Log Cabin Custom-house, to
which point they had to have an # escort of American custom-house officials from
Skaguay. Now ko<h!s are bonded through the American strip in cars. No â

steamer. The opening of the railway has caused the shutting down of the Chil

This removal of the Custom-house has no connection whatever with the boun

plished linguist and hoped that with
his ability he might earn a livelihood.
His appeal was unanswered. He then
turned to the University of California
and met with the same failure. He
could think of no other avenue of em
ployment and made no further effort. â 
Meanwhile the condition of affairs for
Miss Collins was rapidly growing worse.
Among some people she was known un
der the name of Mrs. Marshall and
among others by her own name. Time
after time she and Father Gloria have
made visits to this city and under the
name of Air. and Mrs. Marshall have
registered at local hotels. Complica
tions were arising on all sides and the
church authorities were hearing the
rumors that were floating.
An investigation was instituted by
the church authorities, who sought to
silence the unfortunate and regretable
slander connected with the name of
Father Gloria. The priest was called
before his superiors and admitted the
facts. He offered to resign at once,
but the authorities would not permit
that, rightly insisting that a rigid in
quiry should first be made in his ad
ministration of the affairs of his parish.
While this was in progress Miss Col
lins was interviewed and told her side
of the story.
Rumors were now flying thick and
fast. The tongues of gosÃips were wag
ping as they generally do unjustly and
in exaggeration of the facts. Miss Col
line was told that Father Gloria was
party to a scheme for delay in order
that he might desert her. To protect
herself from the effect of such a con
tingency and from another wild rumor
that her marriage certificate was to be
stolen from her, she sought the advice
of an attorney and had two certified
copies of her marriage certificate made.
One of these copies she claims was
taken from her by a Catholic official.
The other is in the possession of the at
torney and the original is still in her
keeping. While she was taking these
measures for self-protection Father
Gloria was preparing to leave his
church. His resignation was already in
the. hands of his superiors and two
weeks ago he announced to his congre
gation from the pulpit that he was go
ing away on a long vacation and would
probably not come back. Contributions
were made by some of his parishioners
and a purse was given to him. Miss
Collins construed this to mean that
Father Gloria intended to desert her
and she grew then more insistent In
her demands to be publicly married be
fore either she or the priest should
leave Oakland.
Father Gloria agreed to do this. On
Tuesday he again sent in his resigna
tion and promised his contract wife to
marry her publicly to-night, the cere
mony to be performed by a Justice of
the Peace. As far as the Catholic au
thorities are concerned the disagreeable
and lamentable incident has been
closed. The Reverend Father Pimentel
of San Pablo has been chosen to take
charge of the parish that Father Gloria
has abandoned.
Miss Collins, as might be expected. Is
sorely distressed over the entire affair,

able notoriety of her relationship with
Father Gloria.
"As a matter of course," she said
y. -sici-day, "I deeply regret that thi.s
matter has become public, but Father
<;l<>ria and I are to be married to-mo'r
r-'.v. night, and I suppose I must sub

ship, but Father Gloria is a pood man
and my husband. Our contract of mar
riage was made and signed long ago,
and although an officer of the Catholic
Chunh attempted to take it away from
me he succeeded only in obtaining a
copy. i
"Anything in relation to that contract
is my affair and I have tuM it all to
my attorney, who will respect my con
lidences until he receives my permission
to repeat what I have told him. I have
decided to take this step and be pub
licly married for the sake of my boy.
Father Gloria has resigned as pastor of
St. Joseph's Church, and after we are
married he will endeavor to secure a
position. He is a cultured man, and
I am sure if he Is not oppressed will
be able to obtain employment. It is
true that his application to the people
of Stanford University was ignored, but
I will go with him and together we will
makp another appeal.
"The story that my husband intended
to- leave this rountry ami return to
Prazll is utterly false. , He will remain
here and seek a position in keeping
with his ability. He is a good linguist
and a scholar and I am sure there is
some avenue open for such a man. We
have only a few hundred dollars, and
that will not keep us long, so I hope
he may find something 'to- do." .
Miss Collins then related in detail
most of the facts of her relationship
with FatTier Gloria. She spoke bitterly
of alleged attempts made to separate
her from the priest, destroy her mar
riage contract and thrust upon her the
responsibility for the 10-ng. association.
"Father Gloria has promised me sol
emnly," she said, "to marry me pub
licly to-morrow night. I have known
him too long and loved him too dearly
not to know that whatever influence
may be brought to bear upon him he
will not break his promise."

Line of Defense.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, July 26.â
Has a truce been declared between Secre
tary Alger and the administration?
Indications point that way. When Sec
retary Alger resigned he let it be known <
that he had a statement In defense of his
official conduct in course of preparation
which he would give to the public the
[day after he became a private citizen.
Later he decided that he would make his ,
defense on the installment plan, and fol- i
lowing this determination he gave to the {
press on Sunday last official correspond- j
ence to show that he originated the idea of
sending Spanish prisoners back to Spain
and that his ingenuity saved the country
$500,000.
This was to have been followed by an-
Other contribution from official files to
show that be has all along approved the
i idea of sending more men to the Philip
pines." It has not yet appeared, and I was
told by one of the Secretary's friends to
| day that it was extremely doubtful if he
| would make any public statement at the
present time or in the near future. Inti
mation has been thrown out that an
agreement has been reached whereby Air.
Alger is to avoid public utterances in
tended to cast reflections upon the ad
ministration and the administration will
not take sides with the McMillan factions
in a Senatorial contest against Mr. Alger.
In other words, it is hinted that the Presi
dent will maintain a neutral position, just
| as he did in Ohio when the light between
i Hanna and Foraker was on.
Secretary and Mrs. Alger left this morn
! ing for Thorndaje, Pa., where they will
: spend a few 'lays with their daughter.
! Secretary Alger, will make a short visit
j to New York City on private business be
fore returning to Washington next Mon
day to dose up his official connection with '
tin Government.
Major Hopkins assistant adjutant gen

the life ( ,f Williams.
The lynching party, with dynamite and
telegraph poles for battering rams, was
on its way to the Jail when Judge Bower

CAPTAIN ALFRED DREYFUS,
Who is reported to be seriously ill
with ftver.
PARTS. July 2<i.â The Petit Journal

An evening paper is authority for the
statement that General Ztirlinden, for
mer Military Governor of Parts, will he
removed from the Supreme Council of
"War,, as waa General de Negrier yester

The depression in rentes, which de

.solely to the action of the Ministry yes
terday in the case of General de Negrier,
by which M. yfaldeck-RouÃseau, the
Prime Minister, and General Marquis de
Gallifet, the Minister of War, pave new
proofs of their energy in dealing with all
i lementa of trouble.
General de Negrier is acknowledged to
be one of the best French generals, and
as Inspector General of f^ur army corps
and a member of the Supreme Council ..f
War, enjoyed the confidence of his fel
low officers and the public. The compro
mising statements, he made at Bourges
smack s<> Strongly of a coup do etat i>r

NOTHING TO ARBITRATE
IN ALASKAN BOUNDARY
Senator Perkins Declares the United
States' Position Is Un
assailable.
SKATTLE, July 26.â United States Sena
tor George C.. Perkins, who returned here
to-dny from a trip to Alaska, thinks there
is nothing to arbitrate in connection with
the Alaskan boundary. He said:
"It would certainly be just as reasona
ble for us to insist on taking up the
boundary question between the United
States' and Canada again and declare our
dissatisfaction with the forty-ninth de
gree <<t latitude. England long ago recog
nized the boundary for which we are con
tending. She did this when the Hudson
Hay Company, In what at thai time was
practically Canada, executed a ten-year
lease of "the territory from Russia, for
which she fs now contending. She leased
it from Russia and renewed the lease for
a second ten years. What better proof
could we ask for than Great Britain's
attitude up outlined in that contract?
"l"'>nland cannl is ours, and we should
see that the line is extended along the
summit as long as the range do^s not lie
to exceed ten marine leagues from the
sea."
PLANS OF THE VANDERBILTS.,
Henry Villard Thinks There Will Be
No New Transcontinental Line.
BEATTU3, July 2fi.â Henry Villard. the
well-known railroad man, does not take
much stock In the rumored Harriman-
Vanderbilt transcontinental line. He said
to-day:
"It is not practical and there are many
legal and business complications that
would hinder It. No doubt there is a cer
tain identity about the personnel of sev
eral of the roads said to be in on the new
deal, but this would moan nothing-. Mr.
Harrlman is himself identified as an offi
cer of several of the lines and many
c.thers are stockholders in two or more.
â¢As a consequence they are working on a
friendly basis and probably will Continue
to do so. Thus it can be seen there is no
necessity for a reorganization as a trans
continental system. I do not believe it
will ever appear."

CLEVELAND
STRIKERS ARE
UNDER CHECK
The Suburb of Brooklyn Has
Apparently Become the
Storm Center.
ONE CAT MOBBED
Mayor Farley Assumes Police Au
thority for the Whole County and
Leaves Phelps in the Cold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, July 26.â The storm
center of the street railway strike has,
according to the authorities, settled in
Brooklyn, a suburb connected with
Cleveland by a long high bridge. At
noon 150 employes of the Born Steel
Range Company blockaded a car on the
bridge and dragged the motorman and
conductor from their posts, inflicting
injuries more painful than serious.
Soldiers on guard at the barn about
half a mile away hurried to the scene,
but the rioters had taken refuge in the
factory, which stands under the ap
proach to the bridge. The factory was
surrounded and the premises searched,
but there was no clew by which the
guilty ones could be picked out. so they
bent their efforts in assisting the
blood-stained motorman and conductor
to move the car, most of the windows
of which had been broken by stones.
General Ajdine, in command of the
troops here, in order to personally view
the situation, took a ride to-day on an
Orange street car. He was in civilian
dress and the car was stone 1 at vari
ous intervals all along the route. A
rock came near hitting him. The gen
eral took other trips through the
troubled districts, but declined to give
his view of the situation.
The vigilance of the guards while
daylight aided them prevented trouble
of a serious nature. Preparations for
mass meetings at various points were
made during the day. It is expected
that a large one will be held in Monu
mental square, in the heart of the city,
to-morrow night, unless the Mayor pro
hibits it. In preparation for one. a
platform was to-day erected in Brook
lyn to protest against the action of
Mayor Farley of Cleveland, who has
assumed, under the authority of an al
most forgotten statute, supreme police
power in Cuyahoga County. This
leaves Mayor Phelps of the suburban,
together with his constabulary, shorn
of their power, and they do not like it.
The two Mayors are not on the terms
that existed between the storied Gov
ernors of the two Carolinas. The sol
diers and Cleveland's Chief Executive's
special police in Brooklyn are not al
lowed to use the public hydrants to get
water, it is paid, and upon various oc
caeiona bayonets were of a necessity
used to convince the shopkeepers that
it was wisest to sell soldiers what they
wanted. Mayor Farley to-day mailed
May>r I 'helps a letter, in which he de
clared that if the Cleveland cohorts
had any more trouble about getting
water,. Cleveland, which pumps the
water to the suburb, would at the pres
ent abrogate the truce and let thewhole
hamlet go thirsty. Mayor Farley also
issued a statement to the strikers. In
which he said a man who was more
loyal to his labor union than to himself
and country, was a coward and a bad
citizen.
Cars were run on twelve lines of the
Big Consolidated to-day and on most of
the lines last night. President Mason
of the National Union of Street Car
Employes, in an interview to-day de
clared that as the street-car company,
according to his information, was los
ing thousands of dollars every daiy, the
strike would have to be settled soon
upon advances made by the company.
In the face of this President Everett
to-day again told the Board of Arbitra
tion that the company had nothing to
arbitrate. The board is unable to take
action looking to a settlement in view
of the attitudes of the opposing forces.
The task of distributing the soldiers
was to-day completed by General Ax
line. Many of them were sent out to
f>e\vburgh, which includes the turbu
lent section of Broadway, to Pearl
street and to Windemere, where the
street car company has the more valu
able part of its property stored. A com
pany was sent to Collinwood also.
Mayor Farley declared that he would
suppress violence if he had to call out
the entire National Guard of Ohio.
A boy waa shot by a non-union con
ductor, but whether or not the bullet
was an accidental one the police have
not yet determined. Frank Wrig-ht, a
boy 13 years of apre. was sitting on the
front porch of his home at 33. Annan
dale avenue when an electric car came
along. Although there was no dis
turbance in the neighborhood at the
time, it is stated the conductor, who
stood on the front platform with his
motnrman. carried a revolver in his
hand. Suddenly it was discharged and
young Wright gave a cry of pain. The
bullet had entered his right lep Just be
low the groin. The car ran on to Euclid
avenue and ran into the barn. "When
the police arrived the conductor was
not to be found. '
WIFE MURDERER
DECLARED INSANE
Thomas Harrison's Path Lies Toward
an Asylum Instead of the
Gallows.
SACRAMENTO. July 26.--Thomas Har
rison, a farmer on the rofid near Brigh
ton, this county, became possessed of the
suspicion that his wife was untrue to him,
although he could get none of his neigh
bors to believe such a groundless charge.
Gradually the suspicion worked upon his
mind until it made him insane, and one
day he murdered her. tried to kill their
children and then cut his own throat.
Mrs. Harrison, dying, forgave her hus
band. Harrison recovered from the gash
in his throat, and recently his case came
up for trial. It h;i<l not proceeded far
when his counsel abruptly asked for a
jury of physicians to pass on the pris
oner's sanity.
This inquiry was held this morning and
the verdict was that Harrison was dearly
insane. To-morrow, when the murder
trial if recalled, Harrison will be dis
charged and ordered removed to the asy
lum.
Dtiring this morning's proceedings Con
stable Henry Alter attempted to draw a
revolver on District Attorney Baker, who
had criticized his testimony and actions
in the case. Baker showed fight, but the
affair ended bloodlessly.

DANGERS OF THE
SECOND CABIN
Immigrants Use It to
Avoid Scrutiny.
â¦ â
BECOME PUBLIC CHARGES
SESSION OF THE INDUSTRIAL
COMMISSION.
â¦
Dr. Rossi of the Italian Bureau Ex- I
plains His letter Sent Out
During the War With
Spain.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, July 26.â At to-day's
session of the sub-committee of th
United States Industrial Commission,
Roma Dohbler, chief of the boarding j
Inspectors of immigration at the barge j
office, testified that his experience was j
that clerks coming to the United States j
In a second cabin with $40 or $50 were â 
the first to become public charges. The
witness prepared a table showing the j
comparison between passengers in the â¢
second cabin and the steerage. On such j
lines as' the North German Lloyd, Cu- j
nard, American, Anchor and White j
Star lines, the number of saloon pas- j
sengers almost equaled the arrivals in j
the steerage. In vessels from Mediter- j
ranean ports, however, the steerage >
passengers greatly exceeded the other i
classes. Mormons, he said, always came |
on vessels of the Anchor line from j
Glasgow, in the second cabin. His fig- !
ures showed that while 2083 passengers
came from Italian ports in the steerage. ;
only 25 came as cabin passengers.
Mr. Dobbler said that many persons j
came in the second cabin in order '.â¢> |
avoid the rigid scrutiny at the barge of
fice Ho believed many of the new ar- !
rivals had been coached as to their
answers to questions put to them here. !
"William Weihe of the contract labor j
bureau, who was formerly president of |
the Amalgamated Association of Iron j
and Steel Workers, said 50 per cent of |
all the cheap labor coming here, Slo
vaks, Polaks and Russian Pales, went
to Pennsylvania, where they not only ;
worked on railroads and in the mines, ;
but entered into competition in the in
dustrial centers in the iron and glass
â 
**It, htis npt^n Friown, S3.ici Mr- \? eihe,
"that the companies give the preference
to foreigners, even when skilled Amer
ican workmen offer to work for the
same wages."
Dr. Egisto Rossi, chief of the Italian i
bureau at the barge office, said his bu
reau was supported by th Italian Gov- j
ernment. His Government did not en- |
courage emigration to this country. j
The bureau had been established here
to regulate the padrone system and for
the purpose of keeping a record of
Italian immigrants arriving in this
country. While he would not say his (
bureau" had destroyed the padrone sys
tem yet he had been able to prevent
many" new arrivals from Italy coming
into contact with the bankers and pa
drones in this country.
"Do you still regard Italian immi
grants in this country as colonists?' |
asked Chairman Smith.
"We consider as colonists all Italians
who have not taken out naturalization
papers and notified the Italian Govern
ment that they had renounced alle
giance to King Humbert." .
"Is it true that you issued a circular!
letter on April 21 last, in which you said ;
that owing to the war with Spain labor
and industry had ceased in this coun
try and advised your Government not!
to" grant passports to intending imxni- j
grants?" "No. The person who gave
yuu such information did not under
stand my Italian circular. Many per- \
sons were arriving from Italy with in- ;
sufficient funds and I simply called ,
upon the Government to urge upon the j
Mayo and Prefects the necessity of j
being careful in issuing passports, the I
more so as this country was engaged |
in a war and industrial enterprises ,
were in a measure suspended." :
"We have been informed that certain |
Italian Government officials are inter- J
ested in sending contract labor to this ,â 
country and share the profits with the |
padrone," said Major Farquhar. "] do
not believe it possible," said Dr. Rossi.
"I should like names and data. Ameri
can foremen, acting for American con
tractors, have been employing the
methods of the padrone since we have
been able to repress the operations of
the latter."
Commissioner McSweeney was called â¢
and exam on several matters and
the convention then adjourned to meet
in Washington in September.

CUBANS BEG FOR
AMERICAN MONEY
Gomez Says the Gift
Was 111 Timed.
HAS CAUSED DISSATISFACTION
THOUGHT HIS SOLDIERS WOULD
REFUSE THE MONEY.
Instead of This, They Are Grumbling
Because It Was Not Distributed
Quickly Enough to Suit
Them.
Special Dtsratrh to The Call.
HAVANA, July 26.â 1n an interview
with General Gomez, printed In I^a
Lucha, the Cuban commander was
quoted as saying:
"Never has a plague more afflicting
fallen upon Cuba than the 53,000,000
asked from President McKinley for the
Cuban soldiers. The money has been
the cause of ill will among those who,
by right and justice, should be eternally
united.
"It was thought at first that it ought
not to have been rei eived, as i 1 was a
dishonor to the Cubans. The aspect
is changed now, and it should cause
pain to see wandering through Havana
soldiers begging for what it was sup
posed they would refuse with serenity.
"The formation of the supplementary
lists of persons Incapacitated in the
war and the work of payment has al
ready cost $6000. This money was fur
nished by Governor General Brooke, as
the Cubans do not possess the ground
upon which they tread. Th. -
not know the work and expense in
volved are naturally impatient and hold
responsible some one who in no way
helped to set the money or asked any
on to receive It.
"Those whose names appear on the
supplementary lists should not be paid
before those who are on the original
lists, bo as to pr< serve order.
"As the money was the pift of the
American Government I am pained by
the Interest shown by my soldiers, who
were trained to go hungry on their
march to liberty. The republic will pay
them, but when is uncertain.
tience will not further matters."
INCREASE IN PRIVATE
HOLDINGS OF WAR BONDS
The Registration of Coupon Bonds Is
Going Rapidly For
ward.
WASHINGTON, July 16.â The conver
sion of coupon bonds of the 3 per cent
Spanish war loan into registered bonds
continues to go forward rapidly. When
the loan was first issued there were $30,
--814, registered bonds issued on original
applications. Since that time there have
been exchanged $67,040,540 coupon bonds
for registered, so that the total amount
of registered bonds of this issue outstand

amount of bom registered in the names

culation and public deposits increased
rapidly but for the quarter ending Au
gust 1 the total was less man May 1.
At the date of the first interest payment

the registered bonds standing in the
names of national hanks averaged J63.238.
At the end of the next quarter the amount
had increased to $52,050,300-722 banks hav
ing an average holding of 18,422. Ihe
quarter ending May 1 showed a further
increase, the total being $09.341,.60, divided

The quarter ending August 1 will show a
falling-off of about $1,000,000 in the hold

PLANS COMPLETED FOR
THE BIG SHIP CANAL
It Will Provide a Passage From Lake
Erie to the Hudson
River.
ALBANY, July 26.â Engineer George
W. Rafter, in charge of the survey for
the proposed ship canal from the Great
Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, has com-
I his preliminary work and drawn
his report. The proj< t is to cut a canal
, thirty feet deep and 340 feet wide,
i which is three and one-third the depth
land five times the width of the Erie
Canal, from Lake Erie to Lake On
tario, around Niagara Falls, leaving
1 Lake Ontario at Oswego River, through
Oswego River to Oneida Lake, thence
through the Mohawk Valley to the
Hudson River. A single lock will be a
thousand feet long and will be over
fifty feet high. The greatest problem
has been to find storage for water to
feed this great canal on its various
levels and yet not affect the water sup
ply of manufacturing concerns now us
ing various rivers. Mr. Rafter plans a
great dam at Carthage, on the Black
River, in Jefferson County, making a
lake covering eighty square miles of
land to feed the canal.
From this reservoir Mr. Rafter has
located a canal nine miles long, as wide
i as the Erie, to the proposed ship canal,
i just west of Rome, and on the way
: down has planned a secondary reser
voir In the Salmon River. The com
i mission's work also includes a similar
'â  survey for a canal of the same charac
ter leaving th>- St. Lawrence River at
the head of the Coteau Rapids and
; thence into and through Lake Charn
i plain. >

RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HEW VESSELS
Long Divides It Among
the Bureaus.
CHIEF CONSTRUCTOR EASED
HERETOFORE IT HAS ALL REST
ED ON HIS SHOULDERS.
This Ruling Settles the Long-Stand
ing Dispute Among the Heads
of the Various De
, partments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 26.â Secretary
Long has passed upon the long pending j
and rather personal difference which j
lias existed among the heads of the |
various naval bureaus concerning the'
building of new ships, and as a result
a new order, to be known as special
order No. 84, will appear in a day or:
so amending the present system. The
matter has, ai 9iderable feel-
Ing among naval officials and the Board j
of Construction has divided into ma
jority and minority elements, each pre- (
senting reports as to what should be ;
done. The main point has been the ex- j
tent, of authority and responsibility Â«Â»f
the chief constructor and the desirabil
ity of having his bureau pass upon the
proposals of all other bureaus in the
building, arming and equipping of new
ships.
Secretary Herbert placed the respon
sibility almost entirely with the chief
ructor as to all parts of the ship j
and the ship as a whole, and this order,
known as 4.X3. has been the subject of
the difference.
The new order follows In the main the ;
language of the old one. but some
changes in the text were made which
will work considerable variation in the
system Bection lis changed so as to
omit the -designs" of all ships from the
responsibilities charged upon the chief
constructor. Heretofore, he nas been
charged with the responsibility for the j
"designs, structural strength and the
stability" of all ships.
Sections 5 and 6 are changed so that
the chief constructor in passing on pro
posed changes of design, equipment,
etc is authorized to state objections
"so far as relates to matters under the
cognizance of said bureau." The other
bureaus also are required to confine
I their efforts to matters under their own
bureau The general effect of the new
rule appears to be in the line of giving
each bureau a larger share of respon
sibility over affairs directly under it.
DATO POURS HOT
SHOT INTO WEYLER
Acrimonious Discussion of the Army
Bill in the Spanish
Senate.
MADRID, July 26.â The discussion
of the army bill in the Senate to-day
led to an exciting scene. General Wey
ler, arguing against a-ny reduction of
the strength of the army, warned the
Government that the present situation
made a revolution highly probable,
since it had never been so easy for the
army and the people to make common
cause. He, himself, he said, had never
thought of heading a rising, but it must
be confessed that revolutions some
times cleared the political atmosphere
and accomplished the work of regen
eration.
Senor Dato, Minister of the Interior,
replying, savagely censured General
Weyler declaring that a general who
with 300,000 men had failed to suppress
the Cuban rebellion had no right to
make such threats, and that any at
tempt at revolution, no matter by
whom, would be proceeded against with
the utmost rigor of the law.
The Senators warmly applauded
Senor Dato's speech. The army bill
was adopted.
BIG DEMONSTRATION
IN BUENOS AYRES
Populace Turns Out and Demands
Protection to the National

don Bennett.
BUENOS AYRES, July 26.â A mon
â trous demonstration of manufacturers
paraded the streets of Buenos Ayres to
day. About 40,000 persons, employers as
well as employed, and also many women
and children, took part.
A delegation was sent to the \ ice Presi
dent of the Senate with a petition re
miesting Congress to protect the national
industries. In front of the Government
house demonstrators cheered President
Roca, who appeared on the balcony and
pronounced a short speech, saying the
country cannot adopt either an extreme
protectionist or free trade policy. The
Government was resolved to protect all
branches of national industry.
Forest Fire Extinguished.
SAN ANDREAS, July 26.â Many rumors
current during the progress of the great
forest fire are now denied, among the rest
the story of Mrs. McCarty holding up the
fire fighters with a shotgun. The fire has
been extinguished by the efforts of the
people and the computation of the loss is
in progress. The fire covered a wide area
and entailed great loss on the county. It
was the most disastrous conflagration in
many years.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON,
| July 26.â Administration officials are
much relieved by the prospects of an
early settlement of the Alaskan boun
dary dispute. There never was any
fear that controversy would lead to a
serious disagreement with Great Bri
tain, but it was thought at one time
that the obstacles placed in the way by
Canada would result in prolonging ne
j gotiations and might cause friction be
tween the United States and Canadian
officials in the disputed territory.
I was told to-day by an official that
| the two Governments were already con
sidering a permanent settlement of the
controversy on the lines proposed in the
modus vivendl. This official was sure
that if the United States granted Great
Britain a free port of entry on the
Lynn Canal, under the sovereignty of
the United States, the privilege thus
granted would be made permanent.
Any agreement by Great Britain on
this basis will he far reaching in effect,
as it will amount practically to an ac
knowledgment by the British Govern
ment of the claim of the United States
to sovereignty over the Lynn Canal
and surrounding territory and will re
move the only difficulty in the way of
a final demarkatlon of the entire boun
dary line.
The granting of a free port would be
a new departure for the United States,
as never has a foreign power been
given such rights as it is purposed to
allow Great Britain in this instance.
It is analogous to the right of shipment
of poods in bond through territory of
the United States to Canada, but does
further and amounts practically to a
lease of the port to a foreign power.
It would naturally necessitate the
United States maintaining an inspec
tion service in the leased port to pre
vent the smuggling of goods into con
tiguous territory, but the expense of
this service would be paid out of the
rental received from the British Gov
ernment.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
PAY CAR WRECKED
Some One Tampers With a Switch
and Causes a Disaster Near
Dunsmuir.
DTJNSMUIK, July 26.â The Southern Pa
cific piiycur special was wrecked last
night at 10 o'clock at the west .switch at
Morley station. The disaster was caused i
by some outsider tampering with the j
locked switch. The section men had used
this siding at 6 p. m., and knew it had
been left properly sÂ«>t and locked for the
main line. When the paycar special ap- i
proacbed in the night the partly open
switch was observed by the keen eye of
Engineer Estabrook and a serious acci
dent averted. No one was injured. The
engine tender was derailed and the Minor |
hook coupling and platform of the pay- i
car pulled out of place by the engrlne go
ing upon the siding, while the paycar kept |
the main track. The wrecking crew from |
Dunsmuir replaced the derailed trucks of
the tender and at daylight the paycur
was again on its way.

Incineration Will Take
Place To-Day.
HOUR HAS NOT BEEN SET
LETTERS FROM ALL PARTS OF
THE COUNTRY.
Funeral Starts Whenever the Widow
Is Ready â Last Writings

lished. â¢
SDecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 26.â Walston, the
beautiful, at Dobbs Ferry, where Rob
ert G. Ingersoll died, was a quiet place
to-day. The body of the dead agnostic
lay on his flower-covered bier. Only
the widow and daughters sat near; all
others kept away.
Three hundred letters were received
to-day from all over the country, most
of them from intimate friends. Among
those who sent letters were J. H. Man
ley of Maine; Mrs. Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, who wrote a beautiful letter
of hope and sympathy; Octave Thanet,
and Owen Miller, president of the
American Federation of Musicians.
This Is what Mr. Miller wrote from St.
Louis to Mr?. Ingersoll:
"On behalf of 15,000 professional mu
sicians, comprising the American Fed
eration of Musicians, permit me to ex
tend you our heartfelt and most sin
cere sympathy in the irreparable loss
of the model husband, father and
friend. In him the musicians of not
only this country, but of all countries,
have lost one whose noble nature
grasped the true beauties of our su
! blime art and whose intelligence gave
I those impressions in words of glowing
eloquence that will live as long as lan
guage exists."
Colonel Ingersoll's body will be ere
! mated to-morrow. The coffin was sent
I to Dobbs Ferry to-day, but it remained
all day at the local undertaker's. It is
a plain, black, cloth-covered coffin,
without ornament or handles of any
kind, and without even a name plate.
It is simply a box in which the dead
may lie at resrt during the journey to
! the crematory at Fresh Pond, Long
Island.
The body of the dead agnostic will
be transferred from the bier to the
i coffin at 9 a. m. Whenever the widow
i is ready the hearse will start down the
long hill that has been the joke of
Colonel Ingersoll many a time. A Bpe
clal train will be in waiting at the sta
! tion to take the party to Xew York
! City. It is only a few minutes' ride to
i Fresh Fond.
The incineration will be strictly pri
; vate. The time has not even been set,
in order that the public may not know.
The funeral party will wait during the
hours while the body is being con
sumed, to take the ashes back with
them.
The funeral urn has already been se-
l ected. It is the choice from a thou
sand of George Grey Barnard, the
sculptor, and the dead man's friend.
This is only temporary, but it will
* satisfy Mrs! Ingersoll until a finer one
! can be made. She is determined that
| the. ashes shall not be away from her
a single moment.
Whatever was written by Colonel In
trersoll before his death is still unpub
lished and will not be printed.

SHE ATTACKED
HUSBAND AND
LADY FRIEND
Mrs. J. J- Groom on;
the Rampage.
SCENE AT THE VAN NESS
SHE BLACKENS MRS. HETHER
IN^TON'S LEFT OPTIC.
A Jealous Wife Surprises the Couple
in the Lady's Apartments and
Threatens to Kill Them
Both.
Mr?. J. J. Groom, wife of the fight pro
moter, made a savage attack on her hus
band and Mrs. Hethorington at the Van
; Ness House on Market street Tuesday
â  afternoon. Mrs. Groom found her hus
band and Mrs. Hetherington In the lat- j
ter's apartments and without any cere- j
mony proceeded to chastise both of them, i
She blackened Mrs. Hetherington's left j
j eye and scratched her face, besides tear
ing her dress and scratching her arms
and breast. When the infuriated wife \
â  thought that Mrs. Hetherington had been
punished severely enough she directed !
her attention to her husband, who had >
j been tremblingly watching the pn
ings, and began to treat him in a manner
similar to that in which she had treated ;
the lady whom he was visiting.
Becoming exhausted. Mrs. Groom left
! the couple, vowing vengeance upon them.
Her screams created intense excitement
! among the other guests at the hotel, who
! expected every moment to hear the report
i of a pistol.
Mrs. Hetherington, whose husband for- ;
I merly kept the Yellowstone saloon on I
! Montgomery street, called at police head
quarters with a lady friend and wanted i
Mis. (Iroom arrested on the charge of
threats against life. She was taken to ,
! Warrant Clerk Wren of Judge Tread- â 
i well's court and. lifting a heavy black
; veil, showed what her assailant had done ,
!to her. . :
"I am a friend of Mr. Groom, she said,
i "and he called at my apartments at the
! Van Ness to-day to talk to me on some
! business matter. While we were talking
Mrs. Groom came in, and after accusing
1 her husband of all sorts of things com
menced to scratch his face. I said to her
that she should bo careful not to tear
her husband's eyes out, and she turned on ;
me and scratched my face and went at
me like a wild cat. She threatem-1 to
i kill me, and a lady who was in the house - t
said she saw a revolver sticking out of ,
Mrs. Groom's pocket. I want her bound
over to keep the peace, as both my boy
and myself are afraid she will kill me.
"My 'husband is able to keep me. as he |
sends me remittances when I need them,
j and I cannot understand Mrs. Groom s de- .
! Bire to kill me. If 1 felt inclined I could
! punch her face into a jelly. If f=he is jeal
ous of her husband I cannot help it."
While the warrant clerk was discussing
! the issuance of the complaint with her,
â  Groom made his appearance. His face
' also showed the effects of his Wife 9
; fingernails. He talked in whispers with
Mrs. Hetherington for a few minutes and
l they werii away together. So the warrant
I was not issued.
STATE LAW BARS
NICKEL MACHINES
Thus a San Jose Justice Declares in
Deciding an Offender
Guilty.
SAN JOSE, July 26.â Saloon keepers;
cigar dealers and others who rpap har
vest? of nickels from nickel-in-the-slot >
machines are deeply interested In the
case of A. Klein, who was found guilty
by Justice Hirsch to-day of having vio
lated the State law in maintaining one ;

Klein, who If proprietor of the Pastime |
saloon on South Market street, and his â 
two bartenders were arrested a short ;
tim<> ago charged with having robbed j
Henry Eekner, a rancher, of $11'\ They

hail Bpent his money in a nickel-tn-the- .
slot machine. Lekner then charged Klein
with conducting one of these machines.
This city and county license these gam
blnig devices and Klein's licenses were |
presented In court as evidence of his
right to have nickel-in-the-slot machines
In his saloon. Justice Hirsch. however,
found him guilty under the State law and
held him in $200 bonds for appearance for j
sentence to-morrow morning.
The case will be appealed to the Super
ior Court. It will be watched with in

TAKING TESTIMONY ON
THE SMELTER TROUBLE
State Board of Arbitration Has Fin-
ished Its Investigation and Will
Sit in Pueblo.
DENVER, July 26.â The State Board of i
Arbitration to-day concluded its investi- j
gation in this city of the causes of the
deadlock between the smelter manager* I
and their workmen, in consequence of'
which the smelters that are in the trust
have been idle since June 15.
The board will take testimony at Pueblo j
to-morrow and will reassemble in Denver i
Friday to hear arguments. The imjircs
aion is gaining ground that the board's !
decision will be accepted by both sides to
the controversy and that the smelters will :
resume operations next week. The testl
mony given to-day bore chiefly upon the
relations of the smelters to other indus
tries, showing that practically all the pco- i
pie of the State are suffering on account j
of the cessation of work.
Managers J. B. Grant and Dennis j
Sheedy both claimed that it was imposd- i
ble to grant an eight-hour day and the in- I
crease of wages demanded by the men, as '
the increased expense would* have to be
placed upon the producers of ores and
would lead to the closing of many low
grade mines.

DEMOCRATIC BOSSES
Buckley and the Rainey=Examioer
Combine in the Ring.
Gavin McNab's Reform Democracy May Be Absorbed by
the Contending Factionsâ The Lambs Want to
Appropriate Phelan and Dodge.
Inquiry: Why does the Examiner in its pro
fessed review of its anti-bcssism skip 1886?
Was it not hand in glove with Boss Buckley in
that year, and did it not, in that year's cam
paign read every Democrat out of the party who
did not support or who openly opposed the local
ticket put up, notoriously, by Boss Buckley?
Read the record, the record it made for itself
in that year. Respectfully,
AN OLD DEMOCRAT.
July 24, 1899.
The inquiring "Old Democrat" Is in
formed that the EiarrJr.er ha? fought
rr.any campaigns with Boss Buckley as |
its ally and chief, source of strength.
Until ISSO the paper had no other po
litical leader. It would be lighting this
campaign on lines laid down by Buck
ley :f the notion had not prevailed that
Rainey was Buckley's superior as a
manipulator and could swing the Fire
Department into line.
In IS? 1 :- the Examiner was hand and
glove with Bess Buckley. In 1899 it is
hard and glove with Sam Rainey, Chris j
Buckley's old under study and partner.
Less than* one year ago the Examiner
c-r.-ur.ced Rainey as infamous. Years
ago it placed Rainey on a level with
Pas Burns and cartooned him as one
of Huntington's caged beasts.
At Sacramento last winter when the
Democrats had no use for a boss the
Examiner could not get along without
one. True to its instincts for boss as
sociation it turned to Dan Burns, the
Republican boss, for orders. During
the Senatorial contest it was the recog
nized organ of the Southern Pacific and I
the. Republican bosses.
No matter under what conditions or
in what party a contest may arise be
tween the people on one side and the
irifamous bosses on the other the Ex
umirer will instinctively get on the
si'ie of bossism: In every campaign
until IS9O BoÂ«s Buckley directed the
course of the paper. The Examiner did i
nbt go to press until the carriage re- j
turned from Buckley's house.
The Rainey-Examiner combine was
formed for the purpose of seizing the
Democratic municipal nominating con
vention. The combine was willing at
the outset to concede the right of Dem
ocrats to nominate Phelan far Mayor
and Dodge for Assessor. The clubs or
_- .
ganized under the Rainey-Examiner
au.-pices lost no time in adopting reso
lutions- commending Phelan and Dodge
to the people. It was thought t-hat such
Indorsement would take the wind out
of the sails of the Committee of One
HundredJ The Examiner fancied that
Gavin McNab was getting too near the j
throne of Phelan. To get even with Mc-
Nab the combine decided to appropriate
Dodge and Phelan to its own uses. It
was "believed that such appropriation
would divest the committee of its stock
in trade and leave McNab on the side
track.
Boss Buckley in a short time sized up
the scheme c-f Rainey and the Exam
iner and at once determined that his
clubs should appropriate Dodge and
Phelan. A mass meeting is soon to be
held to indorse Pheian and- Dodge.
Many Democrats have the impression

Revenue Stamp Test Case.
Yesterday Marshal Shine served a war
rant on John H. Speck of the firm of A.
M. Speck at Co.. real estate agents, to
test the portion of the stamp act requir
ing month-to-month leases to have affixed
to them a 25-cent revenue stamp: Mr.
Speck was not required to submit to the
process of arrest, but sent his bend "for
his appearance in the first week in Sep
tember. The real estate agents not be
ing parties to these leases or sighting
them claim that the 25 cents cannot be
collected from them by law. Captain W.
J. Bryan and Mr. Mark Lewis- justified
for Mr. . Speck as bondsmen before Com
missioner Heacock. This proceeding will
settle an ambiguous section of the war
Â«tamp act. Messrs. William M. Abbott
and Albert Jeffreys of the Attorney Gen
eral's office will appear in Mr. Speck's
defense. . _

Sbarboro was of the opinion that the
oppesite side of the street could be ob- t
tamed and made into a park so that the j
imposing appearance of the new Federal
building would not be lost to view as is
the City Hall. A lit) later, when the
director? of the association had an op
portunity of looking- over the ground,
they decided that something should be !
done to materialize the views of the -. _. }
ident. They all agreed that the sugges- J
tion was a" good one and that' the Gov- j
eminent would give the proposition a ;
careful consideration if the matter was f
properly presented. As 'a result the fol- j
lowing resolution was adopted and Man- ;
ager Goodwin was instructed to set the
wheels of progress in motion:
Resolved, That in the opinion of the Manu
facturers' ar.d Producers* Association of Cali
fornia, ail that portion of the square fronting
on Market and Seventh streets, and lying be
tween the Postofflce building and Market
street, should be made a part of the PostoJtice
site, the buildings now on it torn down, and â 
the space converted into i park, with proper j
approaches to the PostofSce. building, and.
Be it further resolved. That the Senators !
and Congressional delegation from this State [
be requested to ure-? Congress to pasa a tilt
providing for the purchase of this stte and its
improvement as suggested.
With this for a starter, the whole
strength of this big association of busi
ness men will be used to effect the de
sired end and every, representative of the
people at Washington is expected to lend ;
his influence to induce the Government |
to make the purchase or the" benefit of j
its new building and the public in gen
eral. The plan suggested is that if the
land be purchased it be laid out In walks, j
plats of flowers and shrubbery, etc.
Roughly estimating, the land required is i
about 35) feet on Market and btevenson I
streets and 165 feet on Seventh street, i
That the land would cost considerable
goes without saying, for at the resent [
time, according to a real estate dealer j
who was questioned, it is worth about !
$3000 a front foot on Market street. The j
resolution and recommendations have al- i
ready been sent to ... authorities at j
Washington.

"When the case was called Mr. Hayden
took the stand and told hi? story of his
wife's love for liquor. He alleges that for
some time past she has frequently been
incapacitated from performing her house
hold duties by reason of the liquor habit.
During the cross-examination of plaintiff
the counsel for defense developed several
theories â â¢-.>.â¢ not to their liking.
When closely pressed Mr. Hayden said
that he did not believe his wife to be a
good and virtuous woman. He said that a
little over a week ago he caused his wife
to be followed by an" agent. She entered
a Chinese laundry, he said, and as she re
mained inside a considerable length of
time the agent entered. He- found her
lying on a couch inhaling the fumes* of
opium. Opposite her a Chinaman was
also enjoying the drug and standing near
was her little boy. When he mentioned
the child's name Hayden broke down.
When he regained his composure the ex
amination was proceeded with. Other
matters of a similar nature were de
veloped, after which an adjournment was
taken. Dunne the examination of Mr.
Hayden his wife, a pretty woman perhaps
twenty years his junior, sat by her coun
sel absolutely unaffected by the testi
mony of her husband. It Is said by the
defense that Mrs. Hayden simply en
tered the laundry for the purpose of get
ting her wash and on account of the fact
that a bill of some $4^> is due she was
some time parleying with the Chinaman.
The opium story they say is simply the
tale of one of the usual run of private de
tectives and is false in every detail.

The object of the visit was to gather
data as to the Federal quarantine serv
ice. A vigorous protest against its con
tinuance is to be sent to Washington and
the member? of the board want to be
sure of their ground before saying any
thing. It will thus be seen that the con
flict between the State and Federal au
thorities over quarantine matters Is not
settled, but only just beginning.

SYMPATHY WASTED ON HIX.
Richard Jessup Has Apparently De
termined on a Career of
Crime.
Richard Jessup. the boy who got himself
into trouble recently in being arrested
for having burglars' tools in his possession
and who was released on his own recogniz
ance by Judge Mogan or. the promise of
his sister and brother-in-law that he
would be sent to his father in Redding,
has shown that sympathy is wasted on
He did not go to Redding and was ar
rested yesterday by Detectives Dir.an and
Reynolds and Policeman Rainsbury on a
charge of burglary. He is accused of
breaking into the room of Chris Ander
son 121 Fourth street, a week ago and
Stealing a suit of clothes and a watch He
pawned . the clothes in a.: store on Third
street and the watch in a store on Edd-y
Â«treet. Both pawnbrokers identified him
in the prison. /- . ;
jeÂ«uD" s connection with the Jessup es
tateMn San Rafael and his family history
were fully detailed in The Call at the time
of his previous/arrest. Yesterday he said
that "the reason he did not go to Redding
was because his brother-in-law, Howard
=mith would r.ot give him enough money
to take him there. He got a job- in the
Tech.- . saloon on Mason street, but was
discharged in three days. Then he trot to
drinking and about a week ago. while in
the Thalia, he met a soldier, who pre
sented him with a suit of clothes, and In
the vest he found a watch. He pawned
the clothes and- the watch. That is his
side of the story.
Not a Public Park.
Several years ago E. F. Kysor of Los
Angeles platted a tract of land lying near
the city, and one part was reserved as
a park, the rest being cut into building
lots, and put upon the market by the Ve
rona Street Railway Company, to whom
Kysor had sold the .property. The park
was used as a pleasure resort, which was
platted as "Central Park" on the county
records. Later the railway people gave
the land not sold back to Kysor, who re
ceived a quitclaim deed to the same. He
proceeded to subdivide ; the park into
building lots, and the city of Los Angeles
began suit to quiet title to Central Park,
on the ground that it had been dedicated
to the city. In the lower court it was de
cided that the park had never been ac
cepted by the city, even if it" had been
dedicated, and the Supreme Court, to
which the case was taken on appeal, up
held this judgment.

Prolonged His Leave of Absence.
Shell tins
steward in the army at Manila, died qt
the Russ House yesterday afternoon after
a brief illness. His body was removed to
the Morgue and an investigation will oe
held by the Coroner. Shelton came from
Manila on a two- months" leave of ab
sence, which will expire to-day. He earn-?
to this city en July I and stated that the
object of his visit was to marry a young
lady of San Jose. Some days ago* he visit
ed the home of his prospective bride, but
was informed that her invitation for him
to marry her was merely a joke and he
returned" to this city in despair.
Shelton had betn drinking much of late
and it is supposed that alcohol is respon
sible for hi* death. He complained of
being ill on Tuesday evening, but retired
and yesterday morning ordered breakfast
to be sent to his room. About 3 clock
in the afternoon he was found by a cham
bermaid In a dying condition and was
dead before a physician could arrive.
Amonir his effects are many bills and re
ceipts for liquor and he was reputed to be
a heavy drinker. "V
Shelton was 35 years of age and was
with the army for eight years. He was
detailed to the hospital service on lay 25.
1539 after bavins served for three years
in Company A. Twenty-third Infantry. On
the day following he secured leave of ab
sence for two months and saile^ 1 for the
United States. The only drug found in
the dead man's room was a quantity oi
sulfonal. which he secured to produce
slee>> after a debauch on Monday evening.

THE BfIBfIYLONES.
ANOTHER has been added to the tribes, sept-,
clans rai itionalities found refusing to
be yoked among the new subjects of our impe
t in the Philippines.'
General Smith informs tru United States that Cap-
Byrne with seventy men of the Sixteenth Infan
try went â¢ â  45' > Babaylones, on the island of
fight was with bayonets and clubbed
tin Byrne did not have to wait for
the battle to clear away, but was able *o
results at once. He reported the loss of one
man killed and one wounded, while one hundred and
n dead Babaylones were actually counted, one
was taken prisoner and many were wounded. This
near Bobong.
This and other reports sent out from Manila and
various other headquarters in those part? seem like lit
eral copies i f the typewritten reports ofWeyler, known |
sometime as '"the butcher." His sanguinary reputa
tion and nottime de guerre were acquired in just such
tions at arms as the glorious victory at Bo
botig. Is there something in the climate that does it?
Americans with common sense know that in a
hand-to-hand fight between an armed party of sev
enty and one of four hundred and fifty, no such result
could follow as boasted oi in this typical war bulletin
sent by the censor at Manila. When Weyler was out
there he reported enough such victorious and glorious
engagements to have depopulated the Philippine
group; and yet when we got there >ye found the Span
ish bottled up in Manila and Iloilo, and the natives
in pi >n of the rest of the country ad
ivernment, protecting property, ready
for the alliance negotiated with them by Pratt, Wild
man and Dewey; and existing in sufficient numbers
t" put up a -tiff fight against us when we violated
what they believed to be the alliance between us.
The battle of Bobong ended with the capture of a
I rgi quantity of supplies. From this it appears
probable that a village was attacked and there must
have been nobody at home but very old women and j
very young children, of whom one hundred and fifteen
might have easily been killed, and probably one of |
our men died of the heat and the exultant exercise
of winning this victory.
Upon the face of it, as washed, wiped and exhibited
by the censor to his admiring countrymen, there is
nothing in it to arouse any enthusiasm at home. The
American taxpayers, who are putting up eight hun
dred thousand dollars a day for such victories, were
never wronged by the Babaylones of Bobong, never
received any injury at their hands, never heard of
them until this w.nr bulletin brought the news that
part of their money had beeli invested in butchering
one hundfed and fifteen Babayloncs; chasing the rest I
away and capturing their food stores and other prop
erty. If it give the taxpayers a feeling of value re- \
reived we have no objection, but as it was the^ only I
victory won on the 19th of July we protest that it cost
more than it was worth. The exact cash value of the
stores taken is not stated, so that we have no definite
offset against the bill of expense, but the slaughter
â¢ Babaylones cost us just $6956 per head. We
, have no doubt that is about the cost of killing every
mo that has fallen since General Otis sat dowu
to his typewriter in the palace of Manila and took up
the wondrous tale of valor where Weyler quit.
Our military officers of high degree seem to have !
not only taken on imperial Spanish manners of the
date of Philip II and Charles V, but those other flam
boyant ways which led Cervantes to satirize such vic
tories as Bobong by the charge of Don Quixote on
the flock of sheep. . |
John J. Ingalls has announced a willingness to re- :
turn to Congress if the people desire it, and we shall j
now have a chance to see whether prosperity has so !
turned the heads of the Kansans as to lead them to
look in his direction.
If it be true, ns reported, that the latest Chicago:
city directory contains 163.000 more names than any
other book in the world, it may be put down as the
greatest volume of depravity on record.
The California boys are on the transport and the
transport is on the way; so now get ready for the
transport of the welcoming day. j
INDIAN SCHOOLS.
THE Indian School Teachers' Institute, in its
meeting in Los Angeles, resolved in favor of the
immediate establishment of ten Indian schools,
for 300 pupils each, "in well-populated and suitable
; districts, as remote from the tribe as possible."
While appreciating highly the spirit of self-sacrifice
1 which animates the men and women engaged in edu
cating Indian youth, we must insist that there is nioch
I room for criticism of the method employed. Actual
civilization must precede education. The Indian in his
! natural state lived by the chase. The dog and horse
I are the only animals he has domesticated. The horse
j served as a means of transportation, for the chasing
I of game, and in the pinch of famine both horse and
j dog were used for food. The natural progress from
I that primitive state toward civilization is through the
I ownership and care of other domestic animals to sup
| ply the demand for food, which continues after the
> disappearance of game. The civilized races took pre
: cisely the same steps. It is a far cry from the cave
j man to the millions who dwell in houses and have the
i arts, but the civilized races made that long march.
! From the chase they went on to the possession of
; flocks and herds and wandered with them as nomads',
seeking the natural pasture. When this failed to sup
i ply sufficient forage the next step was taken by the
- domestication of plants and their artificial produc
: tion. This was the beginning of agriculture, the
I mother of all the arts. When man had developed that
far he was in control of his food supply, and there
' fore of the means of civilization by the development
' of wants in excess of the primitive need of food and
1 shelter. When all his time was occupied in supply
! ing these he had none left for development. Applying
this natural process to the Indian, one is impressed by
the sickening mistake made by our Government in
1 dealing with him, if, indeed, it desire to civilize him
1 and preserve his race. He is put on a reservation,
where he has no cattle nor sheep to take the place
of the game on which he has lived, but he is left his
pony and dog, the connection between him and the
chase and therefore the link between him and sav
agery. Then his children are taken away and sent, 1
'"rtmote from the tribe." to school in a strange cli
mate and in the midst of surroundings not natural to
them, and are taught algebra and the catechism to
. equip them for self-support! When they are educated
they go back to the reservation, to its degraded con
tacts with degraded white men, to its white vices and |
their awful results. Having had a glimpse of a better j
' state without the least equipment for sustaining them
selves therein, their smattered education is a millstone
around their necks to drag them deeper than they
'; would have sunk if left to their gee-string and blan
ket. If the greed of the white man could be re- v
strained from invasion of Indian rights, wisdom
would dictate the training of the red men in taking
j care of cattle and sheep; in the agriculture necessary
: to produce food for flocks and herds; in the preserva
tion of the products of their animals, the meat, hides,
pelts and wool and their preparation for use as food.
clothing and shelter. It is known that wherever .in
Indian has become the owner of cattle and has been
protected in his right to them he has prospered. If
this course were pursued every reservation would
supply its own beef and mutton and the hides and
wool would in exchange bring back shoes and blan
kets and clothing. All these are supplied now by the
Government, while the Indian is idle on his reserva- j
tion. sweltering in the vices acquired from white men.
While he was in his savage independence, the prim
itive wants, food and shelter, developed in him the en
terprise and craft needed to supply them from the
stores of nature around him. He is jumped out of
that independence on to a reservation, is fed and
clothed, after a fashion, by -the Government and is
not permitted to take for himself the first step toward
civilization by learning to substitute the lost game
with the domestic animal-; which take its place.
It is idle to try to make a blacksmith or carpenter
out of him. a painter, sailor or soldier. He must have
the natural entry into the arts through agriculture,
and must know that it takes the place of the chase by
which he once lived.
When he has made that much progress give him
schools for his children in the midst of the tribe, and
let the curriculum be such that the savage father sees
his son better equipped by it for getting food and
shelter. Then the influence of education will be upon |
young and old.
There is a little splutter among experts in the East
to determine exactly what relation the automobile I
man bears to the machine. He is not a driver, for he
does not drive it,*nor is he a conductor, nor an engi
neer, nor yet a brakoman. It is admitted he does
something more than ride the vehicle, but we haven't
any word in the language to express it.
MUNICIPAL ECONOMY.
SO general has been the approval given to the
plan proposed by the Merchants' Association
for the purchase of supplies by the Fire Depart
ment, there can hardly fail to be a feeling of surprise
that it, or some similar plan, was not adopted long
ago. It is strange we should have gone through
years of experience with the existing system before
discovering that a. better one could be easily devised.
The plan suggested is a simple one. Under its terms
the Fire Department will prepare each month a list
nf everything it will need during the ensuing month
and will submit statements to. the reputable merchants
of the city with requests to send in bids on the entire
list. In this way the department will pet the advan
tage of getting goods at competitive prices in the
open market at figures based on current market rates.
It will compel the department to keep the department
within its monthly allowance and by doing so assure
merchants in legitimate business that their claims will
be audited and that they will not be subjected to loss
by arbitrary rejection of bills which have been con
tracted against depleted funds.
The Fire Committee of the Board of Supervisors
has agreed with the public in approving the plan and
has decided to report it favorably to the board at the
next meeting. The prospects are it will "be adopted
by the board and put into effect, for the Republican
majority of the Supervisors have shown themselves
determined to keep their pledges to the people and to
carry out reforms in the direction of economy in all
departments of the city government.
The Merchants' Association having been thus suc
cessful in devising one means of saving public money
may possibly be equally successful in drawing up a
plan by which the dollar limit can be maintained
without crippling or rendering inefficient any depart
ment of the municipal administration. The task is not
so easy as that which has been accomplished, and it
is a foregone conclusion that even if attained the re
sult will not have the almost unanimous approval
given to the plan for purchasing supplies.
Many improvement clubs and a considerable num
ber of citizens who sympathize with them desire to
have the dollar limit pledge set aside in order that
the '.ax levy may provide money enough not only for
maintaining the efficiency of the departments, but for
undertaking public improvements. The majority of
THE SAN FT^A^CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 27, 1899.
the taxpayers, however, will support any well-consid
ered plan for providing an efficient administration of
municipal affairs within the dollar limit of taxation.
It is to be hoped the association which was so potent
a factor in demanding the pledge will be successful
in devising a means by which it can be kept without
injury to any branch of the government, or entailing
a parsimony which is the opposite of economy.
MORE EXAMINER MENDACITY.
IN its issue of yesterday the Examiner charges The
Call with having assumed the attitude of cham
pion of Christopher A. Buckley and with aiding
William F. Herrin, the representative of the Hunting
ton monopoly, in the work of meeting its vitriolic
fulminations against {hat resuscitated boss. It also
repeats its accusation of subserviency by The Call
to Kelly and Crimmins.
All these assertions the Examiner absolutely knows
to be false. Its campaign, under boss influences, in
favor of Mayor Phelan and Assessor Dodge, is per
haps the lowest and most contemptible in our munici
pal history. Condoning or extenuating the crimes
against public decency for which Boss Rainey is re
sponsible, it initiated its present struggle for the mu
nicipal spoils by a series of falsehoods, which it has
now reiterated, and by republishing its own particu
lar version of Boss Buckley's record. That represen
tative of unclean politics retorted in kind, but more
acutely and with direct and conclusive evidence that
the Examiner was as deep in the mud as he had been
in the mire. The opportunity furnished by this sud
den quarrel between ancient allies was too good to be
lost. Without taking sides, in the interest of good
citizenship as well as of its own party, The Call pub
lished Christopher A. Buckley's version of the former
relations between the Examiner and himself, and at
the same time offered to print any rejoinder that
might be furnished. It thus rendered a valuable pub
lic service, and it is to be observed that, while Boss
Buckley and the Examiner confront each other with
lowering brows and with eyes glittering with rage,
no answer to Boss Buckley's specific explanation of
former intimacy in the realm of municipal corruption
has even been attempted.
The revelations on both sides are disgusting and
vividly delineate before the people the true causes and
the veracious history of the combinations that de
graded San Francisco, until during this present year
the Republican party, aided by The Call, determined
to introduce sweeping and lasting reforms into polit
ical management. The Examiner is probably the
most arrant hypocrite in the United States. Its
venomous falsehoods render it personally innocuous.
But that, with a record dripping with filth, in which
both the past and the present are involved, it should
impudently assume the attitude of a public censor, is
a phenomenon that defies imitation.
The organ of the fusion Democracy with Sam
Rainey behind it pretends to advocate decency within
the ranks of its own party, and claims that, through
the manipulation of William F. Herrin, indorsed by
The Call, the Republican organization is under the
control of Kelly and Crimmins. These are deliberate
and palpable falsehoods that will be detected and
appreciated by every respectable voter in San Fran
cisco. Within the Republican party, to all appear
ances, the boss system has been utterly and finally
overthrown. Daniel M. Burns was defeated for the
Federal Senate and in every effort to domiifate the
State and the municipality William F. Herrin, and
all the influences he represents, have not only been
confronted but ignominiously beaten. They have
utterly failed in the attempt to control the preliminary
Republican organization for the approaching munici
pal campaign, and have thus been thwarted, down to
the present date, in the conspiracy to deliver Califor
nia to the fusion Democracy next year to which the
Examiner has lent all the assistance in its power.
There is nothing bad in party management for
which the Examiner and its shadowed Philistines do
not stand. But the Republicans of the State have
controlled the unclean elements within their own
ranks, have achieved brilliant victories over monopo
listic usurpation, degrading bossism and all classes' of
corruption! sts, and have supplied guarantees for mu
nicipal officers who will gain success upon their
merits and not through illegitimate combinations.
The Examiner has inaugurated a low and a scur
rilous canvass, but, when the election takes place, it
will probably discover its inability to swing the ax or
to project the spear. This will be a Republican year.
PREPARING FOR THE WELCOME.
IIZ^ROM the steps that have been taken toward pre
paring a reception for the California Volunteers
oh their return from the Philippines, it is prob
able the result will be in every way satisfying to the
wishes of the people. The work of arranging for the
occasion is to be widely distributed and a host of
willing hands will take part in it.
For the purpose of getting assistance from all who
are warmly interested in the reception, the executive
committee has decided to .call a meeting of the com
mittee of the Native Sons and Native Daughters, the
relatives of the volunteers and the military officials of
the State, including Adjutant General Seamans, Gen
eral Dickinson, General Warfield and General Muller.
At this meeting, which* is to be held on Friday, it is
designed to determine upon the plans for the recep
tion and to assign to various committees the work
expected of them.
The transport bearing the Californians is now on
its way home. It is estimated thirty days will be re
quired for the voyage. We have, therefore, just about
a month in which to prepare for the welcome. That
time is ample for the purpose, but there should be no
unnecessary postponement in beginning the actual
work, for a month passes quickly and everything
should be ready before the transport is sighted, so
that there -a- i l l be no rush or confusion at the last
moment.
It is scarcely necessary to say the general public
will cordially respond to whatever appeal may hi
made by the committee in charge of the reception.
All hearts are in sympathy with the movement to
make the welcome a great popular demonstration,
and the more extensive the ovation is made the better
will the people be pleased.
Because two-thirds of the applicants in that city for
enlistment have been rejected, the St. Louis papers
claim the standard of the army in the Philippines will
be the highest ever known. The argument is clearly
unsound. Every St. Louis applicant might be rejected
and still the standard remain lower than that required
of California volunteers.
If Aguinaldo has any desire to catch a Tartar, now's
his chance. There are a pair of them headed his way:
General Joe Wheeler and the army transport bearing
him to Manila. '
When Buckley gets through with his reminiscences,

IS WHEELING ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
rhis California Boy Is Following the Route of the Davis Auto
mobile and Will Try to Break the Record.
NEW YORK, July 27.â Messenger No. f.74 of the Postal Telegraph Company,
who has only one arm. and who attracts attention everywhere in Harlem by the
ease with which he rides a bicycle without handlebars, has started to ride from
New York to San Francisco in record-breaking time. He hopes to maintain
runs of from sixty to seventy-five miles a day for the entire distance. He will
foilow the route taken by Mr. and Mrs. Davis in their great transcontinental au
tomobile for The Call and New York Herald.
No. r>74 in private life is Albert V. Roe. Tie is nineteen years old and usually
lives at Mills Hotel No. 1, in Bleecker street. His left arm was cut off at the
shoulder whUe switching cars at Los Angeles, Cal., two years ago. A brother
and three sisters, his nearest living relatives, live in Grinnell, lowa, and he-means
to call on them in passing.
Roe rides a wheel geared to ninety-one, and steers it by a crotch four inches
long, on the head of the machine. A skeleton rack built over the rear wheel will
carry his baggage. He has ridden a hundred miles every Sunday for ten weeks
to put him In condition for the journey.
THE POSSIBILITIES
OF VAUDEVILLE
TIIK stage that is yet to come con
tains our chief interest. This ha 3
been said before, but will bear
repeating, for it serves to intro
duce the subject of vaudeville
and its patrons, The vaudeville horizon
is so rapidly widening that the possibili
ties <>f its future Bweep are limitless.
Tony Pastor was perhaps the first to offer
the public what is now common enough
in our midst, the first class attraction.
"Stars" of undisputed cleverness, of ac
knowledged and annlauded dramatic abil
ity, forsook the legitimate and other
fields at his beckoning and trod his stago
to the horror of critics and the despair of
their admirers. But one can't live on ad
miration, and many of the "stars" who
wen crowded out of the dramatic heav
ena by the elbows of more pushing but
less gifted twinklers answered the beck
for need. The success of the venture
was instantaneous, and managers with
an eye to the future heeled him closely,
thus raising salaries and bidding effe< tu
ally for the bust. Patrons of the high
class drama shivered and drew back their
skirts from the doors that led to beer and
pipes and vulgarity and the ultimate de
terioration of the stage. Drew back their
skirts is the needed phrase, for the
trouser legs of man and boy walked in
and on till the seats were filled, and if
there were some dull spots in the evening
they Were well chalked out by "artists"
who "sketched" with po^er. The trouser
legs found it good, and the skirts that
ventured were not much soiled after all.
But they were soiled a little, and -he
better class kept away and the evolution
of the vaudeville went on. A few yeara
ago one could not go to the Orpheum
Without in the course of the evening feel
ing a blush of shame mount to her cheek,
but now if things are ever a little "off
color" the tint is such that the young and
pure in heart know naught of its mixings
and hence are not stained.
Attractions are now so worthy, so en
tirely good and clean, that the most con
servative are yielding to their influence
and bestowing their patronage.
This is a century of specialists from
the highest profession to the lowest, and
through all the world of artisan skill as
well. Jf you are particularly adapted to
some special stage work, if cultivating
that specialty to the utmost yields a
large weekly salary in return for a twen
ty-minute performance, will you choose
Instead the drudgery of Btock work, with
seldom a part to your taste? Indeed you
will not. The soul of a true artist would
cry out against forsaking a line company
with a powerful managerial hand work
ing its issues, and we who love what is
tn st and worthiest in the world dramatic
would take up the cry and echo it to a
finish. Kut many a knocked-together
stock ship, launched upon this town with
a mighty flourish, hail better be t>n >k.-n
on the rocks of opinion into vaudeville
sections, small and great, and, with our
blessing, may the small slip through the
cracks in the utage and strike oblivion
with a killing whack! Yes, the stage of
the future contains our chief interest,
and in the realm of vaudeville as well
as any other realm we shall make of it
what we will. Applaud the best, encour
age the artistic, refuse the coarse aixl
vulgar, but remember the while that the
vaudeville stage is a big world to be tak
en hold of with many hands, and the fact
that we cannot appreciate it all is an
evidence of natural limitation. However,
we can all recognize the fit and decent.
and let us give the sanction of our ap
proval to nothing else.
The star among the new people at the
Orpheum this week is unquestionably
Miss Elizabeth Murray. In a very sweet
mezzo soprano voice with a sympathetic
contralto quality, she sings negro melo
dies and copies the coon walk so per
fectly that one imagines she went to the
source for instruction and is not surprised
to learn that she was bred in the sunny
South. Her Irish dialect is musical and
not overdrawn and her stories good and
simply told. Her stage presence is
charmingly refined. T.a Fafalla. the lotus
flower, was conceived in the bud ' with
clumsy intentions but born amidst such
spectacular surroundings that grace al
mostâbut not quiteâ became her god
mother. The spectacle is what we are
charmed with and what we applaud.
Laura Joyce Hell is well, a little coarse.
"Why must we be forced to look at a
woman with a cig;ir In her mouth? Hor
rible! Her sketch, is well constructed on
old lines and the curtain fail is a clever
stroke of playwright skill. When Phil
slaps Polly on the back once it is funny,
but when he does it thrice it is about as
humorous as the same joke printed three
times in a column.
The I'hoites I cannot criticize for I
don't understand them. T am in the con
dition of the art critic who "was looking
and perhaps to-morrow hÂ»> would see."
Next week I shall try again. The noise
is jolly. The Kldridges are good, hut we
are a little tired of them. The old peo
ple have new specialties and continue to
please because they v are clever.

MIDWEEK DRAMATIC NOTES.
"Heartease," as presented by Henry
Miller and the special company at the
Columbia Theater has proved a success
and the theater has proved too small to
hold ihe immense crowds seeking- admis
sion. The demand for the play is so
great that it has been arranged to con
tinue it next Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings, and in addition
there will be . a special matinee on
Wednesday. The rounds of applause
which greet every act of the play at
every performance are sufficient evidence
of the brilliancy and artistic worth of
Mr. Miller's production. It is interesting
fo note that Monday night's performance
of "Heartease" will be the fiftieth per
formance of the Miller season at the Co
lumbia Theater, and the management Has
arranged to commemorate the event by
making it a souvenir night.
The first production in America of the
great London Garrick Theater success,
"Brother Officers," will be staged by
Henry Miller at the Columbia Theater on
the evening of August 7.
The Tivoli's grand opera season wiil
open next Monday evening with a fine
production of Verdi' 3 masterpiece,
"Aida," with an exceptionally strong cast.
Among the newcomers from Europe are:
Fraulein Ella I'rosnitz, a dramatic so
prano from La Scala, Milan; Baron Ber
thald, a phenomenal tenor from the Im
perial Theater. Berlin: Signor Vincenzo
ri, an Italian tenor from Genoa, and
William Mertens, an American barytone.
Among those who have been heard here
before are: Mis? Mary Linck, Miss Anna
Ldchter, Signor Wanrell. Herr Schusti r.
Inez Dean, Signors Avedano and Salassa.
The management of the Tivoli claims that
never before in any city in the world has
so fine a list of lyric artists been an
nounced to appear in opera at popular
prices, and with a powerful orchestra and
increased chorus the forthcoming .
has every promise of being a brilliant
one.
Business has been excellent this week at
the Alcazar. "Faust" is holding the
boards and is artistically presented. This
is Lewis Morrison's farewell week at the
Alcazar. Florence Roberts will remain
some five weeks longer and be seen in
sev< ral of those old reliable emotionai
dramas. "Romeo and Juliet" will be the
bill all of next week, to be followed by
"The Lady of Lyons.'"
"Faust" is playing to good business- at
the Grand Opera-house. Next week the
tuneful â¢'Boccaccio" Will be revived.
The Frawley Company is being well re
celvt <1 ii. "Madame Sans Gene," and is
playing to crowded houses. Seats are now
selling for "One of Our Girls," to follow
"Sans Gene" on Monday.

OLIVE OlLâ Subscriber, City. Experi
ence during a number of years shows that
California produces as fine and as pure
olive oil as has ever been produced any
where, and that the pure California oil
will keep good much longer than imported
oils because of the care taken in Its prep
aration. In Italy it is claimed that the
finest and the purest oil is produced in
Lucca and in France in Nice.
FOR THE WARâ J. F., City. The Gov
ernment is mustering out of the service
the volunteers as rapidly as the work
ran be done. Those who enlisted from
this Slate have in part been mustered out
and possibly within six weeks from the j
time of sailing from Negros Island the
California Regiment will be mustered out
in this city. Those who enlisted in the
regular service enlisted for three years.
The fact that such as enlisted during the
war with Spain in the regular service
were not discharged upon the termination
Of the war with that country is proof that
they are to be held to tl'eir three years'
enlistment.
SPECIAL DELIVERYâ OId Subscriber,
Cktllahan, Siskiyou County, Cal. If â  a
party addressee a letter to "James Madi
son, Chicago, 111.," and places a special
delivery stamp thereon the postal author
ities in Chicago would be unable to de- 1
liver the same unless it should happen
that there was but one James Madison in
that city, and his name was either in the
city or postal directory. If there should
happen to be a dozen James Madlsofia in
that place, the postal authority s would
not he able to determine which one to de
liver, it to, and it is not to be expected
that the carrier, who is allowed but ;i few
cents for the special delivery, would so
out huntluK every James Madison to as
certain if the letter was for him. The
postoffice departments make diligent
search for any one if a clew is given to
his business or place of residence.

Strange to say, that fact of Captain

! facts I never forget. That advertise
ment" (pointing to the announcement that
Blanche Bates would appear at the Cali

happened nearly thirty yean ago to my
mind. Jt was somewhere around 1573, and
I was making my first voyage to sea as a

family were admitted to the house, and
many people prominent In civic and mili

at the last sad rites over the dead million- j
a:re. In accordance with his oft ex- j
pressed wish In life there was no ostenta- j

DYNAMITE GIVES A SCARE
TO THE HARBOR COMMISSION
"An Infernal Machine" Sent to Paris Kilburn Turns Out to Be a

; . . 3 H*i! ?.K was a dynamite scare in

short time Paris Kiibum. pres

that a diabolical attempt had been
made upon his life. Hi 3 fears were
shared by Chief Engineer Howard C.

Toll Clerk Arthur Bolnng. Individual
ly these g-entlemen deny- In the most
positive terms that they were in the
least bit scared, but. intimate that the
other fellow was nearly frightened out

The cause of the scare was a small
square parcel addressed "Hon. Paris
Kilburn. State Harbor Commissioner,

Commissioner Kiibum' s curiosity -was
aroused, and after handling the parcel
for a moment or two he put it to his

inside, and with the remark, "I don't
like the sound of that," he put the
thing down at arm's length.

W H. Wahmuth. a deputy constant
from Aiametia. testified that on or about
Jun*Â» 3 last h-. was detailed to investigate
a compÂ£r-t against the defendant that |
he was going from house to house beg

was not begging, but was calling upon
professional friends to obtain assistance.
He was taken to the police station, and
as he professed to be sick was advised to
go to the County Hospital.

Georze Fisher, night clerk of the Waido |
House~was the next witness and gave i
important testimony. He said that _ the j
defendant came to .iim and complained
that he was tired of treating KehlenbecK ;

came back and asked witness if Kehlon- ,
beck had any money, how mucn and i
where he kept it. Witness did not give

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TITCRSDAY, JTJLY 27, 1899.
"How In thunder do I know?" an
swered Kiibum. "Take it outside and
open it, Arthur," addressing Bolfing.
"Not If the court knows herself."
said Bolfing. "I'll open it here or not
a: ail."
"Well, we'll all go outside and open
It," said Kilburn. An adjournment
was accordingly taken to the main of
fice. Holmes carrying the suspected
parcel. He was very careful to hold
it at arm's length, and picked _his
steps, while Bolfing and Kiibum saw
to it that â -.ere was no jarring when
the doors were opened and closed.
Upon reaching the main oSice Eng
lish. Keegan and. Byrne joined the
group.
Holmes placed the parcel on a table
and Kilburn said: "Now then, Arthur,
go ahead and open it." Arthur opened
his knife to cut the string, and as he
approached the box English ex
claimed: "Look out there, Arthur!
There may be gtmcott in that thing
and if your knife touches it you'll
blow us all to hades." '"Go slow, Ar
thur; go slow." said Kiibum, and with
that the string was cut, and being
tight, parted with a snap that started
the entire party on the run.
ANOTHER ISLAND
WITS TO COME
INTO THE FOLD
Kusaiens Asking for
Annexation.
PETITION TO WASHINGTON
THE KING AND SEVENTY CHIEFS
ASK PROTECTION.
Natives of Kusaie Never Acknowl
edged the Spanish Rule and Con
sider That They O-wm the
Island.
i
The natives of the island of Kusala, in
! the Carolines, want to be annexed to the
I United States. The King, high chiefs
! and prominent men on the Island to the
\ number of seventy-two have forwarded
| a petition to that effect to San Fran
! Cisco with the request that it be laid be-
SOME SIGNATURES OF THE KUSAIEN PETITIONERS.
The anxiety of the islanders to enjoy the privileges and protection of United
States Government is attested by the number and high dignity of the signato
ries.
fore the President. They say not a -word
about the Spaniards or the Germans, but
simply ask to be taken under the fold
of the stars and stripes.
The petition accompanied the following
Tatter:
KUSAIE, May 6. 1539.
Mr, J. F. Cunninghamâ Dear Sir:
The inclosed petition will explain it
self. I wish you would be kind enough
to put it in the proper channel and
direct its course so that it will have
the most effect. It embraces all the
names of the principal Kusaien chiefs
and men. You will confer a favor on
us all here by forwarding it to its
proper destination. Yours most truly,
9 " J. V. 11ELANDER.
The petition Is as follows:
To the Honorable the Senate and
House of Representatives of the
United States: We. the undersigned
chiefs and natives of the island of Ku
sa j,_ (or Strong's* island of the Caro
line" group do petition your honorable
body, if by any means you can. to
take this island under your charge or
government, as we understand there
is to be a change of government
among these islands.
We have been in Intercourse with
the American people for forty-seven
years; tUat is. American missionaries,
traders and whalers, and many of our â¢
people have been to the United States
and have been In the service of the
Americans.
We therefore pray your honorable
body to extend your government here.
When they recovered their courage
the wrapper was taken off. revealing
a headsome leather box, neatly sewed
and almost square. In the top had
been cut a small opening, and from
this protruded a thin piece of some
thing that looked like a fuse. "An in
fernal machine, by Jingo; and I
thought I hadn't an enemy in the
world," said Kiibum. When sure that
it would not go off he picked it up
and after a cursory examination found
the names "Kilburn-Oleson" written
on one of the corners. The Ccrnn-.s
sloner at once produced his private
memorandum book and went care
fully over the names of the Democrats
he had replaced on the water front
with good Republicans, but never an
Oleson could he find among them.
The box was finally cut open and
found to contain strips of cane wound
looseiv around two pieces of wood.
Just at that moment Henry Lynch
came in and asked what the box had
been cut up for. ""What is it?" quer
ied : [burn. "Why. a Japanese pil
low used by the women," answered
Lynch. "They put it under their
necks so as not to disarrange their
hair while they sleep."
And now Kilburn is wondering why
such an article should be sent to him.
because there Is no other foreign In
terest here but American.
Here follows the signatures of the peti
tioners.
The pÂ«eople of Kusaie have long been
more than friendly to the United States,
while they hated the Spaniards and bare
ly tolerated the Germans. While Spain
claimed sovereignty over fhe group, the
natives of Kusaie have never acknowl
edged them as masters, and outside of
one or two Isolated spot 3on the island
Spain had no control. The natives gov
erned themselves, and whenever tue
Span- made a move the islanders
would at once rise up and drive them
back.
When the barker.tine Ruth arrived
from the islands a few months ago she
brought the news that the Germans were
trying to secure a foothold on the island
and the natives were preparing to resist
them. Now that Germany has purchased
the group from Spain she will at once
take possession, and then there may be
a war on Kusaie similar to that in the
Philippines. The petition of the Kusa
iens has arrived too late, and the chances
are that had Spain still been in posses
sion no action could have been taken in
the matter.
The petition came here via Honolulu
and yesterday Mr. Cunningham forward
ed it to the President.
A DRUMMER IN TROUBLE.
, George L. Osgood Convicted of Petty
Larceny by Trick and Device.
GÂ«r?Â» L. Os?oo<i. a drummer, "was ar
rested in January last on the charge of
petty larceny by trick and device. He
' ordered a suit of clothes from Morris
I Cohen, a tailor on Kearny street, and sent
a note to Cohen to send the suit by a boy
to the Mirror saloon and he would pay for
It. He took the suit from the boy and
' skipped. When arrested he told Judg-e
; Megan such a plausible tale that the }
j Judge released him on his owe recogniz
ance on his promise to pay the price of
S the suit. He did not keep his promise
and the Judge issued a bench warrant for j
his arrest.
Osgood kept out of the way of the police j
till Tuesday, when he was arrested in I
Oakland and brought to the City Prison. <
Yesterday morning he appeared before '
! the Judge and was convicted on the !
i charge and ordered into custody to appear
for sentence this morning. He paid for
the suit yesterday morning, but the Judge
lis determined to punish him. His hand 3
were covered with diamonds and he was
dressed in the height of fashion.
It is probable that a much more serious
charge will be made against Osgood. as
yesterday afternoon the prison officials j
â¢ were notified not to release him on baiL

will unite in honoring the Xebraskans as
the Oreg-onians were ' honored. Ail the
troops here, including the Oregon Regi
ment, will parade and will be reviewed by-
Major General Shatter.
Yesterday was visiting day at the new
general hospital and thousands of tender
hearted women visited the returned in
valid soldiers. None of the men are
dangerously ill, though many are suffer
ing from chronic diseases. Visitors are
allowed on Wednesdays and Saturdays
from 2 to 3 o'clock.
No more women and children will be
allowed to so to the Philippines. Major
General Shafter was besieged with re- i
quests of wives who wish to accompany
their husbands to Manila. In response !
to a cablegram General Otis replied that
no more should be sent, as Manila wa3
already congested with too many women
and children and there was no room to ac
commodate any more with convenience or
comfort. , .
The Collector of the Port has acceded i
to a request of General Shafter that bag
gage of returning soldiers be examined
while they are in transit from the trans
port to the Presidio. The baggage of
those who are very ill will be examined at
tne hospital. â â M

WHEN THE BOYS COME
MARCHING HOME AGAIN
DESTBE FOB A LEGAL HOLIDAY
WHEN THEY ARRIVE,
No-w that the headquarters of thÂ« Na- '
tive Song and Daughters of the Golden
West, who win receive the California
Regiment when it reaches here within the
next thirty days, are In full operation,
a number of people have called to make i
suggestions as to what should be done. ;
Those in charge say they will be pleased
to have suggestions made in the matter
of decorations and, in fact, anything that
will make the event as glorious a one as it
will be possible to make it-
To-morrow there will be the joint meet
ing of the citizens' committee, the com
mittee on war medals and certificates ap
pointed by the Grand Parlor of the Native
Sons and the reception committee ap- \
pointed by the subordinate parlors of tne
order, for the purpose of agreeing as to
the details of the reception and subse- ,
quent events. ; â '-â¢'â â  ,
As yet the Governor has not made any
public announcement that the day on
which the California boys shall land will
be a legal holiday, but it is believed the
fact that the people want it declared suca |
will induce him to issue his proclamation I
to that effect. . ,'â ; .
Grand Marshal Pistolesi, who will lead
the parade, will in a few days confer with
Brigadier General Shatter with regard to
the position of the military that will take
part. In the parade the veterans of the .
Philippines will be accorded the post
of honor and as there will be no counter
; march those who will follow them in line
will not have an opportunity to see the
men they re to honor; therefore an ef
fort will be made to have the regiment
halt at a point on Van >â¢'--â  avenue, face
east or west and allow all in the parade
to pass by and salute the men.
On the night of August 2 there will be
a minstrel show in Native Sons" Hail in
aid of the reception committee's fund and
for several days and evenings past there
I have been rehearsals to the end that the
! affair shall be a success. All the talent !
will be contributed.
The committee will seek donations for
: the banquet that is to be given to the re
turning soldiers and it has been estimated
i that the following articles will be re

Ftvison up to date. These teams head the

The teams are practically tied for the

GREAT PROGRESS IN
TEMPERANCE WORK
Encouraging Reports Head in the
School of Methods at Pacific
Grove.
PACIFIC GROVE, July 26.â An impor
tant ea : : '' "'' meeting marked
th* beginning of 1 - work of the
Woman's Christian Temperance T'nion
Hurimr r School of Methods. In on.- of
â¢ ! ,- reports read the fact was brought out
that the Increase in membership In the
various local unions of the State during
the past few months was greater than
ever before in the same space of time m
the history of the work on this coast.
This was accounted for in two ways:
First, the increased Interest being shown
everywhere in temperance work in all its
branches; and second, the contesi tor
large delegations to the coming National
Women's Christian Temperance I mon
convention that is beint? carried on in all
The first regular session of the day was
held this afternoon. Mrs. Sturtevant-Peet
presiding The lirst subject under discus
sion was the Pacific Ensign, the temper
organ "f the Pacific Coast.. Mrs.
Bradley, business manager, gave a
financial statement regarding the paper
and Mrs. M. C. Lord, the editor, Bpoke
of it^ policy and work. "Mother's Meet-
Ing" by Mrs. Ma M. Jamison, "The
church' for Temperance," by Mrs. L. P.
Williams, and "Shall We I'ossess the
Land'. 1 " by Mrs. D. J. Spencer were three
notable papers of the afternoon, but the
chief event of the session was an address
on the relation of total abstinence to
missionary work, delivered by Mrs. Mary
R Phillips, president of the Women a
Christian Temperance Union in India.
The evening session opened with .1 de
votional service conducted by Mrs. A. 1,.
dove Mrs. K. Morine Law, national or
ganizer for the National Women's Chris
tian Temperance Union, delivered the ad
dress of the evening, her theme being
-Personal Liberty and the Remedy for
Hard Times." The chief point empha-
Bized by the speaker was that Instead ol
being opposed to the American principle
that all are entitled to "lift, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness," the temper
ance movement was designed to maintain
that principle and give life, liberty and
th* purpuii of happiness to those who do
not have them.

The orpanized wheelmen of this city will shortly be afforded an oppor
tunity to entertain William Reymann, who is making a circuit of the plobe
with his bicycle. He left New York in February, 1897, and has suffered
every conceivable hardship since that time. The illustration shows him with
his bicycle upon his shoulder as he prepared to wade through the many

JEFFRIES WILL SAIL
FOR EUROPE TO-DAY
Big Champion Confident of Defeating
Sailor Sharkey When He
Heturns.
NEW YORK, July 26.â James J. Jef
the pugilist, arrived to-day in this
city after a p!e;Â«sant tllUr across the <
country. The big fellow will sail for
Europe to-morrow on the North â 
man liner Fu-rst Bismarck. He is in i
condition for his I â  with ;
Charley Mitchell and Jem Smith, which
take place abroad within a fort
night. Jeffries will return here about. :
mber 16, when he %vill go into
I training at Asbury Park for his fight
I with Sharkey.
"The sailor," said Jeffries, "has I
doing considerable talking about how
quickly he will polish me off when we
â¢ meet. I don't say I will beat him in a
punch in four rounds, or anything of
that sort. Sharkey is a big. strong fel
; low and has a chance to defeat me, but
I think I will g<-t thf- decision when we
meet."
Regarding a match between hmiself
and McCoy, Jeffries paid h^ did not
lider the "Kid" in his class.
â¢McCoy." h* Paid, "is a good, clever j
middleweight, but has no chance
against heavyweights. If McCoy, how
ever insist? on a match with me. he ;
jean obtain it, provided he will ftKree,
that the winner take all. I am not In .
the fighting gam- for fun. I want to
get all the money out of the game there
is in it while I am on top. When some
fellow comes along and beats me I
want to have a bank account on hand.
; a beaten fight, r is not much account
unless he has money in the bank."

MEXICO'S REFUSAL TO
EXTRADITE KEETON
State Department Believes a Lapsed
Treaty Is at the Bottom
of It.
WASHINGTON. July 26.â Inquiry at the
State Department fails to show that
there is any legal authority for the re
ported extradition from Mexico into
Texas of John Keeton under a charge of
sheep stealing and his subsequent trial
In Texas for train robbery and murder.
The extradition law pledges the country
to try the person surrendered only on the
charge preferred as a basis for extradi
tion The conclusion that the Mexican
authorities arc r- fusing extradition on
the charge of train robbery because it
waa alleged thai Keeton was only an ac
complice if? also said to be erroneous, and
it is believed That the rpal reason for the
refusal was because the time of train
robbery was committed during the ab
sence of the old lapsed extradition treaty.

COMPELLED TO MARRY
A GIRL HE WRONGED
Tony Pryor of San Francisco Becomes
a Benedick Under Compulsion
at Yountville.
NAFA, July 28. â Tountville has a scan
dal. It Involves the enforced marriage of
a rich young San Franciscan to a girl he
had wronged. The principals in the affair
ar.- pretty Kate Riley of Yountvllle and
Tony Pryor, a son of J. K. Pryor of San
Francisco. Young- Pryor was sent into
the country by his father because he was
coins at too lively a pace in the city. At
Yountville he met Miss Riley and won her
love The young woman is soon tp become
a mother. " When her secret was learned
her father rounded up Pryor and com
pelled him to marry the girl forthwith.
Rev. William B. Thorn of St. Mary's
Episcopal Church performed the cere
mony Immediately afterward the hua
banri disappeared and it is not likely that
he will return to his heart-broken bride.
J X Pryor has been here inquiring into
the antecedents of the Riley family, with
the Intention of bringing action to annul
the enforced marriage.
The affair has aroused the indignation
of the people of Yountville. Miss Riley
(iv \v Mrs. Pryor) is a pretty country lass,
unused to the ways of the world and un
suspecting of the snares of the tempter.
Public sympathy will he with the young
woman when the attempt is made to in
validate her marriage.

HEAVY CROPS IN THE
SACRAMENTO VALLEY
Grain Output in Yolo. Sutter and Co
lusa Counties Will Be
Large.
WOODLAND, July 26.â A Call repre
sentative has just returned from a trip in
the river farming districts on both sides
of the river in Tolo, Sutter and a portion
of Colusa County. Farming operations in
these districts are conducted on a larger
scale than in any other portion of the
State. The crops are very large and even
at the low prices that prevail the season
will be a prosperous one. On the Sutter
side of the river more than 25,000 acres of
land that for several years has been com
paratively unproductive this year pro
duced a big yield of barley. S. M. Mun
kitrlck will have 30,000 sack's, which is the
largest crop produced by one man on that
side of the river in ten years.
On Grand Island the yiold will range
from twenty to Thirty sacks oi barley and
from nine to twenty sacks of wheat to th^
acre. The following are estimates of the
crop-- produced i :' those who are
farming on an extraordinary scale: Mil!, r
Bros.. 7 â¢ - sacks:' W i" Curtiss
30.000 to 40,000 p;icks: J. C. Frazer. about
the same: William Montgomery, 10,000 to
50.000 sacks; S. H. i ! 20,000 to 30.000
sacks; C. P. Wilson. 20,000 to 25,000 sacks.
There are a number of other farmers who
will harvest from 5000 to Ifr.OOO sacks each.
Tnere are eight steam harvesters and
a large number of harvesters propelled by
mule power in operation on the island:.
The bulk of the wheat crop will he
banked on the river in anticipation of a
salt without the expense of warehousing.
The barley crop will also be banked, and
most of it has already been sold at prices
ranging from 9,"> cents to fl 02*4 per cental.
The steam harvesters are running on the
Fair ranch. It will be twenty days hefore
the harvesting of the 9000 acres of grain
is completed. The yield is estimated at
from 75,000 to ino.ooo sacks.
The steamer San Jose has been taken oft
the river route and its business is going to
the Queen of the Yukon, which makes
two round trips a week from Colt]
San Francisco. It is expected that tho
transportation companies will have con
siderable difficulty in handling the im
mense quantities of grain.

HOT WEATHER FOOD.
The selection of food for hot weather j
is an important question. "We should '
avoid an excess of fats, cut down the !
butter ration and Indulge more freely j
In fruits and food easy of digestion, i
One meat meai per day is sufficient
during- hot weather.
An ideal breakfast is Grape-Nuts, j
treated with a little cream (which, by,
the way, supplies the necessary fat in j
a very digestible form) a cup of Pos- j
turn Cereal Food Coffee, hot, or if cold, j
it should have a little lemon juice j
squeezed in; then some fruit, either
cooked or raw; also perhaps two slices !
of "ntlre wheat bread with a very thin
spread of butter, or perhaps a little j
Grape-Nut Butter, which is a different j
article than Grape-Nuts. A breakfast j
of this sort Is so perfectly adapted to ;
â¦he wants of the system that one goes I
through the heat of the day in com- j
fort as compared with the sweaty, dis- }
agree - condition of one improperly
fed. Once put in practice the plan will j
never be abandoned during the hot
days. for the difference in one's per- !
sonal comfort is too gTeat to be easily â 
forgotten. Price 15 cents per package. [

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THU KSDAT, JI'LY 27. 1599.
THE OLD WHALER
NORTHERN LIGHT
IN A BAD STATE
Returned to Port in
Leaky Condition.
CREW REFUSED TO PROCEED j
LONGSHOREMEN ON SACRAMEN
TO STEAMERS STRIKE.
i
Steamer Australia Sails for Honolulu j
and the Steamer America
Mam for Japan and
China. ;
A few days ago the bare announcement j
was made that the bark Northern Light j
had returned to port on account of haying j
sprang a leak off the lightship. The yes- ..
sel is still in port, as the leak cannot be j
located, and a lawsuit will more than
likely follow in consequence.
The Northern Light was supposed to be
seaworthy when she sailed for Grays Har
i bor. but when the lightship was reached
â  Captain. Challeston found she was leaking j
!at the rate of eight inches an hour. The j
I pumps were manned and an attempt made j
!to clear the ship, but it failed. Fire was j
j got on the donkey-engine and the steam j
i pump started, but the crew refused to
j proceed. Captain Challeston said he was
! determined to go on to Gnys Harbor and
: the men said they would leave" in the
; boats.
The sailors went to get their things, but
I when they approached one of the boats the
j captain was there with an ax and said
' ho would stave in every boat on the ship
! before he would allow the crew to desert.
â  The men then refused point blank to work
i the vessel, so Captain Challeston had to
â  rettrn to San Francisco. Off Meigga
i wharf the anchor was dropped and the
i sailors lost r.o time in getting ashore.
! They had been twenty-four hours at the
! pumps and wanted no more of the North
i era Light.
The man who got the bark ready for her
' voyage is blamtd for the whole trouble,
'â  and the owners are talking about suing
i him for damages. The Northern Light
: . was built In IS3I for a whaler. For over ;
â  forty years she made a periodical trip
â  to the Arctic, and only went into retire-
I meni in Oakland Creek when Captain I
i James McKenna could net afford to lit
; her out. In her latter days, in order to
'; help her to withstand the buffeting of the i
1 Arctic ice, she was sheathed with oak
i planking, and when she cape out of re
â  tirement this was still on her. She was
1 fitted out and formed one of the fleet that
I took gold hunters to Kotzebue Sound.
: When she started on that run she sprang
I a leak, but the blame was thrown on men
: who had carelessly knocked holes in the
i hull when fitting her out.
On her return from Kotzebue the North
! em Light was again laid up, but when
: the demand for lumber vessels became
i great she was purchased by Captain John
! Challeston; C. D. Bunker and others, who
! timed her into a lumber vessel. The oak
I sheathing was taken off in order to thor
' oughiy overhaul the vessel, but when it
i was put on again the trouble began. The
â  owners say the work was not properly
i done and in consequence the vessel leakd
1 like a sieve. The ship carpenter says that
: ail the life has gone out of the wood and
', that the nails simply punched holes in it
â¢â¢ that did not nil up. In any event the old
I Northern Light is lying useless on the
! Mission mud fiats, where all attempts to
â  stop the leak have failed so far. In a day
) or so she will go on the drydock. and if
; the hull cannot be fixed up there a lawsuit
' will follow.

The annual strike of longshoremen who
handle the river boats during the fruit
season took place yesterday. During the
winter months the men only get 30 cents
an hour, but as soon as the fruit begins
to come in they usually demand 50 cents
and get it. Yesterday morning the steam
era Pride of the River and Onward arrived
from Sacramento River points crowded to
the guards with freight. The longshore
men to the number of 200 made a demand
for 50 cents an hour and were refused.
Trouble was feared, so the California
Transportation Company asked for police
aid and Sergeant Mahoney and Officer
Mackay were sent to the steamer. They
at once cleared the wharf and only al
lowed a delegation down to negotiate with
the company. A compromise was finally
reached and the men went back to work
at 40 cents an hour. They asserted, how
ever, that they would strike again this
morning and refuse positively to handle
the freight unless they get 50 cents an
hour.
On the down trip Nets Nelson. one of
the deckhands of the Onward, fell over
a pile of freight and broke his leg. He
was sent to his home as soon as the
steamer docked.

BIG SIDINGS STARTED.
The Southern Pacific to Put in SOOO
Feet Bet^re^n Bakersfield
and Mohave.
The Southern Pacific Company has com- j
menced work on the construction of four ';
sidetracks, each 2000 feet In length, on j
the Tehachapi division, between Bakers- !
field and Mohave.
The distance between Bakersfleld and i
Mohave is sixty-eight miles, and such is !
the rough nature of the country that no I
fewer than eighteen tunnels are encoun- :
ter^d on this length of road. The South- j
crn Pacific now runs ten trains daily
through them. When the Santa Fe has .
completed its tine to San Francisco it will
also" utilize this portion of the road un- !
t'.er an agreement it has entered into !
with the Southern Pacific people. This j
will raise the total number of trains to
twenty a day, making necessary all the
precautions against accident that can be
possibly taken.

mer resting- place for themselves and

The site selected is in the famous
Horseshoe Bend. Taking advantage of
the lieu land act of Congress' and by
purchase from settlers they have ac
quired the .v..- frontage for several
miles, their possessions extending back
also well into the primeval forests. Ex
tending the entire width of the bend.
a massive stone building erf unusual
dimensions is being erected. It is ex
pected that the finishing touches will
be put on this winter- When finished
and furnished it is estimated the cost
of this building will foot up $100,000.
The structure is entirely of stone, ex
cept the inside finish, and has been
in course of construction for several
months, a small army of men being en
gaged on the building and about the
grounds.
A portion of this mountain principal
ity will in time be transformed into a
park-like pleasure ground, with rive
ways, lawn stretches and woodland re
treats. The larger portion of the land,
however, will be left in its primitive
state and be used as a fish and game
presprve.
The architectural design of the build
ing is in keeping with the surround
ings as they will appear after the
landscape gardener has completed his
work. A banquet hall and a large ball
room re features of the building,
which Is not designed for public uses
in any sense, being merely a sumptuous
retreat for the owners and their friends
when summer drives them from thi
city to the mo-untains.

BRUTAL ATTACK
UPON A WOMAN
Bound and Gagged by Her Assailant
and Left Helpless While He Ef
fects His Escape.
SANTA ROSA. July 26.â John Leslie, a
well-known Windsor rancher, brought
word to the Sheriff's office this afternoon
of one of the most dastardly crimes ever
committed in Sonoma County. Early last
week a woodchopping camp was estab
lished on the Leslie ranch. Mrs. Ralph
Shank, wife of one of the men em
ployed, was given charge of the camp
and" employed as cook. On Sunday after
noon, while the men were away, Mrs.
Shank was suddenly seized from be
hind. She was bound securely, and to
stifle her cries a rude gag. consisting of
an etnptv flour sack, was thrust into her
mouth. "Her assailant is believed to have
been a tramp noticed in that vicinity the
Upon return to camp the men found the
unfortunate woman still bound and
gajrsred. lying in the tent. As soon as
she was released and gave her husband
particulars of the affair the men started
in search of her assailant. The hunt
proved unsuccessful, and late at night
they returned to camp. The search ras
resumed the next morning, but the man
had apparently made good his escape. A
thoroueh investigation will 'be made by
the Sheriffs office.

TRADE LAST TEAK.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"We have now reached the end of the fiscal
y,ar of the United States, ariC the official re
turns enable us to make a comparison between
thÂ» two most remarkable years In the foreign
trade of the country. TÂ»Â»<en as * whole, the
tm<le of last year exceeded that of the year
nreceding-the total of imports and exports
Sort being $1,924,000,000 for 1898-99 and
t1547.000.000 for 1897-98. showing an Increase
of $77 000 000. The increase, however, has been
entirely upon the imports, which exhibit a sain
of SSI 000.000. while the exports have declined
$4 000 CCO The increase in the imports deserves
attention. About three-fourths of that gain
has arisen during the second half of the , ear:
which shows that It has been almost entirely
the consequence of the great revival oi busl
rK, which set In with the opening or lisas.
ThE Mansion In the imports, however can
hardly be regarded as an in; llratio" 'arison be
deney to over-trading, whether comparison lie
exports was. for last year. J504.557.000 and lor
1897-98 5634.626.000: and for the two years to
gether. J1.039.153.000. Against this must b* set
off a net debtor balance, consisting ofj nter
eat pavme-nts, travelers" credits, ocean freights
etc etc.. which it seems to be generallyicon
ceded may be fairly estimated at about 51.a.-
Couooo.p<Â»r year. Making a deduction of $3..0.-
COOIOOO, we have 5689.183,000 remaining to creditor
account on the two years' operations. As we
have probably no very important amount oi
Soatiig funds now to our credit in the hands
of European borrowers, it appears probable
that this balance, less in- KJMW* '^TtH
paid to Spain, approximately represents the
ret amount of American securities sent home
from Kurope within the two last fiscal years.
NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
Henry Clows' circular says:
"The contest between the employes and the
managers of the Brooklyn surface railroads,
and the fear of it spreading to other roads, was
a deterrent to large speculative movement* in
the stock market during the week. Transactions
were consequently principally confined to the
quick in-and-out traders, and this attitude is
likely to continue until this unrest on the part
of labor has been fully settled. The continued
good railroad earnings and crop advices un
dvubtedly favor the maintenance of prices.
The only discouraging- factor Is the outlook of
the money market, although it has worked
Br.mewhat easier during the week. The next
e.-veral bank statements, therefore, are looked
forward to as important factors in the situa
tion and will be potential in their influence
In affecting fluctuations. The activity in trade
end the uses of money there still continue
a'l over the country, and this doubtless inter
feres with the flow of money to this center.
The low bank reserve for this season of "'
year Is ofTset by the general feeling that the
demand for funds upon New York for the mov
ing of the crops will be materially lessened
us compared with previous years, due to the
unusual supply- of money which has accumu
lated at all interior points. The uniformity
In the rates of Interest in the four great money
centers of the world at the present time rep
resents a condition of established relations
which is likely to be more or less permanent
Jn the future The ability to change this by
Kurope, so far as its being applied to this
country, has been checked, if not lost entirely.
by our growing increase in exports of manu
factured goods, together with our having taken
tli" immense quantity of American securities
from them during the past two years. The
unloading of these on the part of Europe was
not due to a want of confidence, but to two
oihÂ»" better reasonsâone being in part to set
tle a large trad â¢ balance in our favor, and the
ether the high prices that these securities had
attained, which made it more profitable to sell
them out and reinvest at home.
â¢'Foreign exchange drawers have now com
niÂ»nrÂ»d'to put out sixty-day (.ills against grain
shipments. This will keep the exchange rate
below the shipping point and removes any fur
ther apprehension of gold shipments for the
season which is a very favorable factor, as the
frequent rumors of late of gold shipments, and
the ff-ar thereof, have severely handicapped the
market."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
: â  "NEW TOtlK. July There was not much
â¢cfianire in the character of trading In securl
tl/lsVto-dn'y.i There wo? a period when the mar
ket made â¢'.some 1 show of strength In sympathy
with' an .upward movement In a ftroup of Indi
vidual stacks, but a violent slump In American
Malting 4 was sufficient to put an end to the
r'se and wipe out pretty much all of the pre
v'ous gain. General Klectric rose W z on the
opening quotation Pennsylvania showed signs
of strength early and there, was a conspicuous
absorption of Rock Island which Vas at
tributed to thÂ« operation of a pool, Buying
from the name source was supposed to account
for the advance of l & In People's Gas and for
the vicrrous upward movement In the Gould
Southwest storks. St. Louis and Southwestern
issues were the most conspicuous as to activ
ity, the preferred rising 1 1 -;. Kansas and Texas
common advanced nearly a point, the preferred
about two points and Wabash preferred 1%. At
the same. -time the Chicago and Eastern 1111
--nois jun)Ded three points. Wall street's ex
planation was that St. Louis and Southwestern
â was to be acquired by the Chicago and Eastern
Illinois, and the combined properties then ab
poibcd by the Rode Island. President Edwin
Gould authorised a denial that he cu.-UemplateU
Eellinir his holdings In St I>ouls and Southwest
ern. Utterances to the sain.- pur: by Kock
Island officials wore published. About the same
time came disclaimers from the Offden Gas
Company Interests that they contemplated sell
ing out. to i'eojile's Gas, and People - Gas lost
practically all of its gain. There was a vio
lent break of svi in American Malting pre
ferred and 2"-i In the common, which completed
the unsettling of the market. Prices drifted
away to the lowest of the day and' were not
rriuch affected by a spurt in the. late dealing
In Lake Erie and Western, which rose on the
common l-~ and In the preferred I points.
American car preferred was also marked up
I. Sew York Central was decidedly heavy al!
day and lost over a point net. St. Paul, Minne
apolis and Sault Ste. Marie common was con
ppicuous for v rise of l^ and the preferred ad
vanced a point. The money market was in
clined to firmness, and there was some calling
of loans which necessitated a shifting, though
no great difficulty was found In securing ac
commodation. Much doubt is still felt as to
the extent of the demands which will be made
upon New York to move crops. Discounts in
London were further advanced and the Bank of
Fneland continued to buy cold In the open
mark- ' besides receiving consignments from
Germany, "sterling exchange in New York res
ponded with a fractional decline.
The Southwestern railroad mortgages showed
pome strength In sympathy with stocks, but
otherwise demands were dull and rather heavy.
Total sales, par value, $2.620,000.
United States threes coupon declined hi. but
the new fours registered advanced V* and the !

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 26.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were stagnant to-day except
for the continued booming of Westralians.
Americans were forgotten. Contanjoes were
stiff,, being 6 per cent and half extra for the
new stamp duty. On some Btocka even 7 iÂ«r
cent was demanded. Rates on foreign storks
were also exceptionally stiff. The explanation
I? the lar^e amount withdrawn on account of
tHe Westralian boom, It is expected here that
the bank will raise its minumum discount rate
to-morrow to 4 per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO July 26.â Wheat started strong at
-,-..â,. gradually rose to 71% c, an advance of I
y,c over yesterday's close. The strengthen. ng .
influences were strong. Liverpool cables con- j
tlnued in light receipt with unfavorable crop
advices from the Northwest, where hot winds i
were Â«aid to have Inflicted a good deal of in- I
jury on growing wheat. After the first buy- :
ing" rush was over, however, trade became dull
am! September sagged back to 71% c. The de
cline as helped by weakness at Paris and
the aliened splendid outlook of the French]
crop. While reports of damage to spring wheat j
were very numerous, yet there wore enough
promising a good crop in the aggregate to make <
traders cautious. The lack of Inquiry /or cash
wheat was another reason for the majority ot j
traders electing to await further developments.
The range amounted to only %c during the eu
tire â¢"Â« si on, with a trade of a professional
character and nine-tenths of It of a local char- ,
acter. September closed at 71%0.
Reports of possible damage from heat ana
lack o^ rain strengthened corn. September ,
E^\ n KOod" S d'emand from shorts caused a rally in
oats early, but this was all lost In later profit
taking, closins unchanged. ;
Large receipts of hogs and lower prices at the :
yards weakened provisions. Selling on stop- â¢
ioss orders was again a feature. On the break ,
packers took held freely and part of the de
cline was recovered. September pork lost 12%

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, July 26.â Thei American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool trade:
The wool market continues strong and there
Is still a good volume of business In progress.
Manufacturers, however, have not purchased
during the past week quite as freely as pre
viously, although the transactions of the week
aggregated more than an average week's bur.i
ness amounting to over 7,000,000 pounds, One
feature in the situation Is the fact that the
buying is now almost wholly for consumption,
speculation being less of a factor in the trad?
I than for several weeks. The larger portion of
the business done during the past we?k has
been In territory wools, as usual, although
there was a good demand for fine Australian
wool, but as has been previously observed, the
market is pretty well cleaned up of this class
of wool.
The Bales of the week at Boston amounted 1o
6 54iÂ»,0Â«) pounds domestic and 722,000 pounds for
â¢ eign, making a total of 7,271,000. against a total
â  of 10,164, 500 for the previous week, and a total
' of 4i875.000 for the corresponding week last
year.. Bales since January 1, lsiÂ». amounted to
167,047,000 pounds, against â¬5,993.810 pounds last
year at this time.

poor.
In the middle of the session the market Im
proved, in sympathy with an advance la Corn,
due to dry weather and hot winds in Kansas
and Nebraska, and the Northwest started in
to buy freely, but the local talent fought the
advance. Subsequently the market quieted

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Bran and Middlings show rather more firm
ness at unchanged quotations.
Hay continues dull and weak. The. circular
of Somers & Co. says:
"Receipts for the week are very nearly 4400
tons of Hay, or half as much again as for the
week preceding. This makes an average of
over 700 tons a day. which Is about twice as
much as our market ordinarily consumes. This
increase In shipments has hurt the market
badly, and matters are in about as bad shape
here as we have ever seen them before.
"Each day of heavy receipts finds the mar
ket from 25c to 60c per ton lower, and we find
it more difficult each day to effect sales even
in the face of the decline In prices. Buyers are
of the opinion that the present range of prices
will be considerably lowered it shipments con
tinue as they have for the week or two past.
We trust that shippers will hold back for a
bit, so as to allow the market to be cleaned
up and some slight reaction " set In.
"When the market comes down with a run.
as it has been doing, there seems to be no
stopping it. except to shut off the receipts.
Price* right now are below the actual cost of
production in many Instances, although this
seems to cut no figure with the consuming ele
ment here. All available warehouse room Is
being engaged wherever there is hay, and from
all reports we understand there will be a large
surplus that must seek a market before the
rains We therefore feel little encouragement
concerning the immediate future of the mar
ket but believe that for the next two or three
months we will see a very low range of prices
"The markets In the southern part of the
State have been Investigated somewhat, and we
find that in the chief southern market. Los
Angeles, hay Is selling for but a slight ad
vance over San Francisco prices, thus preclud
ing any possibility of relieving our market here
by shipments South. We hope to see that sec
tion of country come to us In the winter for at
least a portion of their supply, but San Fran
cisco will meet with sharp competition from
Arizona and Texas. This idea of a southern
market is somewhat indefinite at present. We
hope to be more thoroughly advised in the
matter later on.
"The dealers here are doing what they can
to run the market on a firmly established basis,
believing It to he to the Interest of all con
cerned, producer and consumer alike. Ex
tremely low prices work a hardship on the con
sun by encouraging competition, while the
injury to the producer need not be discussed.

DRIED 7RUITS. NUTS AND RAISINS.
The market for new Prunes Is opening slow
ly. There have been several rumored small
sales of Santa. Claras on the basis of 3'4c for
the four sizes, but the market has stiffened
up since then, and none can now be obtained
under 3%c. There is considerable uncertainty
regarding the sales at 3>-ic, end nobody seems
to know who made them, nor for what pur
pose, as this is a pretty low figure for Prunes
this year, when the crop is very small all
over the world, except here In California. It
Is probable, however, that they were either
forced or made to affect the opening prices.
Peaches and Apples continue weak, but
Apricots continue very firm, with an upward
tendency.

CONTRACTS TO
BE DISHONEST
WERE DRAWN
Mitchell's Story Is
Revived.
WHO SIGNED THE PAPERS?
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT IS NOW
WITHHELD,
! Non-Appearance of E. Black Ryan
Has Caused Politicians to Ask
Some Very Pertinent
Questions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway. July 2S.
A very interesting- little political story
is being revived, made more interesting
at this particular time In view of the
many criticisms being- advanced regard-
Ing the county assessment rolls.
In the fall of ISS6 during the county
campaign there were several candidate?
for the three vacancies 'on the Board of
Supervisors. The leading candidates
were "W. S. Pelouxe*. John Mitchell.
Charles Roech and Thomas Wells. At
that time County Assessor Dal ton w.is
being hysterically support ed by the
Democratic organ at San Francisco. No
Supervisorial candidate could get the sup
port of tha.t paper except he would aeree
to support the line of conduct in making
assessments which the Democratic news
paper claimed to have, outlined for Mr.
Dalton. Contracts were drawn up. the
consideration being that the support o*
the Democratic paper would be accorded
those candidates who agreed to support
Mr. Dalton* s assessments of corporation
property. Nothing was to be eft to the i
discretion of the Supervisors in the mat- :
ter of assessments. Just who signed was j
never known, but Peiouze. Roeth and j
Weys were accorded the hearty support i
lit that paper. . Mr. Mitchell was asked
why he. being on the same Republican
ticket with Mr. Roeth. should be vioient
iy assailed and unjustly traduced while.
his running mate should have the most
flattering daily notices that could be cre
ated.
Mr. Mitchell told a very interesting
story. He said that on two occasions- he
had been called into the Democratic
newspaper office ar.d had -been asked v>
sign one of these contracts. He declined
on the ground that such a proceeding
would be. cieariv illegal, highly improper
and would be equivalent to agreeing on
a verdict without hearing the evidence.
The next day Mr. Mitchell was a^ain
called into the office and presented w.th
a contract a little less exacting, and till*
also he declined to sign. The following
morning the Democratic organ assailed
his honesty, his manhood, his social re
lation?, and succeeded in making for him
*o many friends of a desirable nature
th^t he 'was elected by a very handsome
majority.
Now everybody is wondering what nas
become of thesecontracts. in. view cf the
fact that the Democratic newspaper has
cieariy shown that Mr. Dalton need ex
pect no further favors from it. Has the
time for which these contracts were to
hold good expired? Did any member of
the present board sign them? If so, have
they been released? These are the ques
tions that the knowing politicians are
asking as they discuss on the street cor
ners the non-coming of E. Black Ryan
toÂ«ght;the railroad's assessments.
MERCHANTS' CAMPAIGN TO
KEEP TRADE AT HOME
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, July 2b.
The Merchants' Exchange has started a
campaign in the interests of Oakland
merchants. They have adopted the repeat
of a special committee on the stimulation
of manufacturing and trade in Oakland.
It is the intention of the merchants, if
possible, to pledge local purchasers to
deal at local stores wherever the condi
tions are' ec.uai with those across the
bay.
The report, which is very lengthy, con
tains the following facts and proposals:
This matter la too important for any
one - ho has the commercial welfare
of himself and his neighbor at heart
to act in otherwise than with good
faith. If there have been any per
sonal differences . existing between
business men in the past, these they
should cast aside and all unite their
energies for the common good.
We are satisfied that if the business
men will do as we here suggest the
s In this community will increase
fully from 1') to 20 per cent in a year.
Every community is judged by the
condition of its industries, a factor
which plays no small part in affecting
the value of realties. These industries
must be fostered and en.-ouraged to
Increase their working forces. The fact
â¢-.ught never to be lost sight of, and
yet our existing industries are woe
fully neglected. The trade that tney
enjjv is but an inrtnestimaily small
percentage of the business that is
closed in their respective lines. It.
would, therefore, seem to be very evi
dent that the merchants need to be
educated as weil as the consumers.
We would further suggest that at
least IGO.OOQ circulars, so worded as to
carry conviction to every reader that
his cr her personal income, whether
laborer, clerk, capitalist, factory oper
ator, professional or business man. is
constantly being lessened by their
neglect and carelessness in this man
ner. This, we think, can be done, and"
with excellent effect.
One of the circulars should be placed
in every parcel that is sent out from
each and every store in the cora
munU>. As before stated, we must en
list the press and the pulpit in the
cau^e. All of our suggestions w-ill cosl
money, but we believe it will prove to
an excellent, judicious and well paying
investment.
As the work progresses, new -ideas
will be advanceo. A3 the favorable ar
guments that can be made in behalf of.
this are inexhaustible, and the litera
"ture tc be distributed by the mer
chant? will be republlshed as rapidly
as it gives out. in? work, must in 110
wise be allowed to lag.
We submit this report for yr><ur con
sideration and adoption, inviting any
amendment that will prove to be ad
vantageous and beneficial to the com
mercial Interests of Oakland and Ala.- ,
meda County.
The same committee was appointed with
power to formulate a system to carry out
its recommendations.
Police OfScers to Be Tried.
OAKLAND. July 2*s.â Police Officers

THE SAX FBAKCISCO CALL, THfBSDAY, JILY 27. 1899.
SICKNESS PREVENTS
FURTHER ACTIVITY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. 30S Broadway, July 21
Câ . â ' HE physicians of Hon. J. West Martin hold out no hope that he can
ever again take' his place in the active business of the city. Fr>r nearly
a year Mr. Martin has been confined to his home with a complication of
>J> ailments., largely due to tr.e fact that, although 77 years old, he was,
until this sickness overtook him. one of the most energetic business
men of Oakland.
or over a generation Mr. Martin has been one of the most prominent men
in financial circles In California, and owing to his ability and energy many
larce and prosperous industries have been originated and developed. The
history of Mr. Martin is that of a successful pioneer. In the old colonial
State "of Maryland, where he was born in " --. and educated, he decided to en
ter the ministry, but discarded this early ambition to enter the field of com
merce. Forty-six years ago he drove his own herd of cattle and sheep into
California and with his brother purchased the Santa Rita ranch in this
county and for years they literally owned cattle and sheep upon a thou
sand hills.
Mr. Martin is president of the Union Saving!" Bank and vice-president of
the L'nion National Bank. For some time he was president of the Oakland
Gas, IJght and Heat Company. He was one of the most successful and con
servative Mayors Oakland ha? had. and was a very practical and useful
member of the Board of Regents of the State University. He has taken
much interest in historical and geographical research, and has been a lib
eral patron of art. He is a member of many scientific and educational so
cieties.
Three years after his arrival in California Mr. Martin married a daugh
ter of the late United States Senator Henry S. Foote. who is also a sister of
Hon. W. W. Foote. The large fortune accumulated by Mr. Martin has
largely been the result of the marked ability and influence of his noble wife.
HOWARD WRIGHT MAY
LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY
POLITICAL DILEMMA IN THE
UNIVERSITY TOWN.
Dan Burns Thought to Be Interest*
in a Successor to the Ex-Speaker
the House.
BERKELEY, July 26.â 15" Dan Burns
preparing to play a hand in the Assembly
district now represented by Howard E.
Wright? From all appearances poiitieaJ
complications are brewing which promise
to cause <iuite an agitation among locil
politicians. It is said that in the event of
a special sesssion of the Legislature How
ard Wright will be induced to tender his
resignation, leaving a vacancy which isÂ»
already coveted by several openly de
clared candidates.
â  Rumors, have been circulated through
out the city for the past two or thr'->e
weeks to the effect that Assemblyman
Wright had already asked to be relieved
from his position. The reports hayÂ«Â»
â¢"â¢air.eo credence to such an extent that
they are now passing about unchallenged,
ana several political aspirants are
u-ing them as a handle with
whlcd to advance their own cau
didacy. Some have openly asserted
that Howard Wright had resigned; others
that he had given hl= word that he would
"r*:gn until the question of his successor
has been taken as a matter of open spec
ulation. , , ,
The men m^st prominently mentioned
in connection with the fight are William
F Overstreet. E. C- Martiave. James M
Oliver and Edward J. Prins One of
the^e, W. F. Overstreet. has already an
nounced himseif as a candidate and has
commenced preparations to canvas tho
field It i? generally understood, too.
that Burns is interested in . Jtroet a
fight and that it was with Burns advice
that his candidacy ha? been made public.
In face of thus comes the somewhat
surprising assertion from Howard W right
hjmseif that not only has he not resigue l
but that he has no intention of doin_; so.
When ask-d about the matter Assem
blyman Wright said to-night;
"ThiÂ« whole thins has come as a jcrent
surprise t>-> me. It is the first: time I havo
heard about it. I do not seee how it is
possible for any one to be making a tight
for my place uhen it is not vacant. As
yet no one has mentioned the subject ,-.;
resigning to me. It has never entered my
mind to do anything of the kind, and un
der no conditions would I think of takin?
such a step. If there are candidates,
spreading this report around they do so
without any warrant whatever. It would
put the district to a treat deal of un
necessary expense should It be oblig-'d to
hold a special flection, and that alone
would be sufficient reason for me to con
tinue to the end of my term."'
In spite of this preparations for the tigit
are going on in the university town and
the Question of candidates Is b"ing openly
(ti?cussÂ«?d as though a special election had
already been ordered.

HALL CHARGES
DIRECTORS WITH
SQUEEZING HIM
Suit Filed Against the
Chadbournes.
WAREHOUSE COMPANY CITED
STOCKHOLDER THWARTS SALE !
OF DELINQUENT STOCK.
Accuses Alleged Officials of In- '
creasing President's Salary Ex
orbitantly and Trying to
Freeze Him Out.
Oakland Office Sir. Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, July K.
As a result <â >* a sensational suit filed in
the Superior Court to-day by E. E. Hall,
the sales of the tatter's shares in the
Ckadbourne Warehouse Company, which
was to have taken place at Pleasanton at
4 o'clock this afternoon, wa3 thwarted;
and more serious developments are ex
pected. The suit involves complications
-..-.-.: will prove decidedly interesting.
The complaint, drawn up by Attorneys
Nusbanmer & Reed and Harris & Dona
\ hue, inferent:aliy charges Joshua Chad
bourne and his sons with conspiring to
force Plaintiff Hall, a stockholder, out of
the company by levying an assessment on
his stock to pay an exorbitant salary of
$500 per month to the corporation's presi
dent, Joshua Ch3dbourne.
. Judge Greene has issued a restraining
order preventing the sale oi Haifa shares
at Pleasanton this afternoon; and the
Chadbournes have been cited to appear in
court on August T to show cause why cer
tain resolutions raising President Chad
bourne's salary to SoOO per month should'
no: be declared illegal.
Hall alleges that on December 20, 189S,
Joshua. H. P. and T. E. Cbadbourne held
a purported meeting of directors at Pleas
anton and passed a resolution fixing the
salary of the president of the Chadbourne
Warehouse Company at 550 per month;
that on June 6, 1SÂ», they levied an as
sessment of $100 per share on the stock
of the company: shortly afterward a no
tice was published in a â â¢â â â  paper
announcing the sale of Hall's eight shares
for delinquent assessment to be hÂ«id to
day.
Hail asserts that such assessment was
illegal: that a day on which such assess
ment should become payable was never
fixed, and that the stock purporting to be
owned by T. E. and Howard F. Chad
bourne is In reality the property of Joshua
I Chadbourne. their father. Hall charge.-?
that Joshua Chadbourne has already
drawn down $3000 as salary under tne
arbitrary resolution passed by himself as
president and his sons: and he prays the
court that he be ordered to refund the
money to the coffers of the company and
: that the action of the a!L**ea board- of
directors be declared Illegal and void.
Hall moreover contends that $iw per
month would be a reasonable salary for
the president. _
The chadbourne Warehouse Company
I was incorporated under the laws of this
State in lS9d with a capital stock of XoOjOw.
> Â«hares at $WOO each, with but $500 actuahy
1 paid on each share. Pleasanton is the
! principal nlace of its thriving business. _
I Plaintiff Ha.l for several years acted in
1 the dual capacity of vice president and
' e-n^ral manager of the company, but tne
i bringing of a suit by him against the
Chadbournes for $130 caused unpteasant
ne~s that eventually terminated in his
dismissal. _ ,

ALL WERE PROBABLY
FEELING PRETTY GOOD
PLAN OF DEFENSE OUTLINED IN
THE MANNING TRIAL.
Attempt to Show No Lamp Was
Thrown, but That Mrs. Kennedy
Stumbled Into the. Burn
ing Oil.
The preliminary examination of Corne
lius Manning, the lamp-thrower, charged
with the murder of Mrs. Mary Kennedy,
came up before Judge Conlan yesterday.
In the morning I">r. Zabala. autopsy phy
sician, and Dr. Artigues. attending phy
sician of the deceased, testified as to the
nature of the wounds that caused the
lady's death.
In the afternoon Paul Kennedy, hus
band of the murdered woman, took the
stand and told how in attempting to pro
tect Mrs. Manning, the mother of the de
fendant," she met with the injuries that
resulted in her death.
The cross-examination by J. â.- K.
Wilson attorney for Manning, plainly
brought cut the line of defense to be
adopted It is the intention of the defense
to plainly prove that Manning never at
tempted to throw the lamp at his mother
or for that matter at any one else. They
wili endeavor to show that after a per
sonal encounter with Kennedy, wno was
considerably the worse for liquor. Man
ning tied from the room, upsetting the
lamp in his night; that the lamp fell over
Manning's left hand and that he. endeav
oring to protect himself, flung:, the lamp
from him. The burning lamp, counsel
will try to show, fell igainst a door and
then upon the floor, and that Mrs. Ken
nedy who was feeling .rather merry,
-stumbled into the burning oil.
Kennedy was not a happy witness -under
Gross-examination. He got stubborn and
his memory as to time failed him. He
admitted that he was a drinking man:
that Mrs. Kennedy also was not a\-erse to
accepting a cheerful glass and that upon
the Fourth of July, the day of the lamp
episode, both he and Mrs. Kennedy had
had several cheerful glasses. He, how
ever denied that he was Intoxicated. As
to Mrs. Kennedy's condition, he declared
he could not tell, as he had not noticed
How many sociable glasses she had im
bibed.
Leonora Manning, sister of the defend
ant, took the stand to identify the lamp
offered in evidence.
One more important witness remains
to be examined. Mrs. Manning, mother
of the defendant. Mrs. -Manning is ill in
bed and on her account the case went
over until next Tuesday afternoon at 2
o'clock, when Mr. Wilson hopes she will
be able to appear. The little nephews oÂ£
Kennedy, respectively aged ti and S years.
who were witnesses of the burning, have
also been ordered to be in court at the
next hearing.
BIG INCREASE OF STOCK.
Southern Pacific to Add 550.000.000
to Its Present Immense Capital.
At the meeting of the board of directors
of the Southern Pacific, which takes place
this afternoon, the capital stock will be
raised from J15Q.000.Q00 to $3Â»,0GO.00O. This
action is in line with the contemplated
reorganization of the Central Pacific and
its consolidation with the Southern Pa
cific.
The two roads will surrender their
stock, making one consolidated interest
which will be divided in proportion to
their present holdings among the differ
ent stockholders of the two roads.
a- the stock of the Southern Pacific
will- not pay anything much in the way
of dividends for some â¢ time to come, a
bonus of between fifteen and twenty mil
lion dollars in Southern Pacific sold bonds
was offered as an Inducement to tempt
the Central Pacific stockholders to enter
Into the agreement.

Oakland Office San Frar.cisco Call,
SOS Broadway, July M.
Joseph Boardmaa and his girl wife will
have to fight for their property. The
war opened in earnest to-day when At
torney Eugene Deuprey filed his lispendens
on the entire estate of the aged capitalist.
i The notice declares that there is an ac
tion pending between Elizabeth Gladstone
and Joseph BoarJraan. and '"that the ob
i ject of said suit is to obtain a decree for
; damages and the setting aside to piaintiff
of one-hair of all the properties and pos
sessions of defendant, real er personal,
wherever situated."
Joseph Bcardman is opposed to mothers
in-law on general principles. This state
ment "was made in writing to-day by Jo
i seph Boardm . mother-in-law. The
I statement contained none of the expla
nations which should go with it, for it
| is hardly capable of reason how a man
can marry a â¢__â â - not over IT, 'as
Boardman vowed he would marry, and
not run the risk of encountering a.
: mother-ia-iaw.
! . Mrs. Wall the mother-in-law in this
! case, sat up until 3 o'clock this morn
tug, preparing a little statement for the
press. She is very tired of being a
mother-in-law, particularly the mother
in-law of her young daughter's aged hus
band. Mrs. Walker- objects to meddle
some people. Sh<* Infers that if some
thirg be not done to protect iir. Boaro
man from such meddlesome people, she
can easily see his finish. Tnat gentle
man's â¢â¢rinish""wiil be a host of lawsuits
and a distribution of a generous portion
lot his wealth among attorneys. As Mr.
Boardmaa is 75 years old. however, it is
not at ail complimentary to reter to his
'â¢finish.' 1 Presumably those among his
i friends who are doing so refer solely to
; the finish of his fortune. ,
Mr* Walker's written statement, tor
which she desires publication, is -- roi
io *Kindiy permit me a few words
through your columns. If there is
anything to be admired it is truth and
honesty. I in it to- the letter.
i wish to state most emphatically tnat
I have never had any quarrel with Mr.
Boardman. nor am I likely to have ;
The nearest approach to anything o
the kind was only a suggestion that
he have his home place nxed up neat
and orderly. 1 see no quarrel in that.
He is opposed to mothers-in-law on
general principles. I have been a
scapegoat long enough, and it is tims
It was stepped. He has lived at my
home for over a month, and I believe
he could remain on for an indefinite
time without any trouble to me or
himself. I have never influenced him
or caused nim to be, to deed his
property to his wife. It was his own
proposition, acted upon through Wil
liam Anderson, a gentleman in his em
ploy. Dr. Cleveland is a well-known
gentleman on the coast. It is hardly
plausible that he would want his old
friend of thirty years' standing to do
anything inimical to his interest and
welfare. Mr. Boardman was willing
to deed his wife all his property and
wished to do so. When he called at
the Central Bank for his deeds he -was
cross-examined as to his intention and
he backed out. They sanctioned a deed
of trust, but not of signing of deeds.
I have no comments to â â¢ â â --â  but all
the same there is food for digestion.
I believe Mr. Boardman can live in
peace the rest of his days- if he is let
alon* by meddlesome people. Those
who seem to be sitting on the fence
with axes to grind. I trust myself and
family will be allowed to pursue the
even tenor of our way in peace. For
the benefit of those who don't think
this way I'll say if war is their
motive why. so it will be.

ectlon of Children, had been deposed
rom office by the board of trustees, ar.d
hat Peter Beanstoa had been selected to
ill the place. Mr. Wadharn denies that
my such action has been taken, and
rives the following as the condition -cf af-
â¢ a iÂ«s relating to the matter: Several
veeks c?o he asked the board to him
in assistant, who would attend to ihe
iffice York and the clerical duties, aa
.Vadhaui desired to be manager cf the
mtside work. The duties of both places
xeitoo much for one man to attend to.
V'-eciaily a-5 the care of the Eureka Boys'
lame containing about forty children,
ail npor his shpulders. ThÂ» request was
-ranted and the new assistant will he ta
he office before â  long. Mr. Wadhaia
tates that when it is considered that
hrouÂ«ch his efforts the present board was
lected it is not likely they will oust

The runaway team was the property of !
a grocer at Sixth and Minna streets. At

California and Montgomery streets, the j
bit broke in the horse's mouth, releas- !

lose ail control over the animal. The ;
loosened harass frightened the horse |
and it broke into a mad run. A dash 1
was made down California to Sansome. ;
then up Sansome to Sacramento, where
the horse swung around abruptly Into )
Sacramento street.
As the swaying vehicle approached Bat
tery street, Kennedy, whose dray was
standing at the corner, caught sight of !
it. and realizing the driver's danger, i
; sprang Into the street and met it. He j
seized a portion of the broken harness i
and clung on until he brought the ani
mal to a haic some distance beyond. Hia |
act was applauded by bystanders aa ex- j

Attorney Lovrenthal Voices His Opin
ion ci Herbert Choynski.
Herbert Choynski. attGrney-at-law. was
branded the crookedest lawyer at the bar
yesterday, and he did not resent it. save
with a few -words intended to be sarcastic,
but which fell short of the mark. Attor
ney H. H. Lowenthal is the holder of the
opinion above set forth, and he voiced it
Tuesday during the hearing- ct the peti
tion of Mrs. Ernestine Kreling to be dis
charged as administratrix nl the estate
of her deceased husband. William Kreiinj,
late proprietor of the Tlvoii Opera-house
By the terms of a compromise ejected
between the heirs of the deceased. Mrs.
Kreliis took the -house as the
widow's share, the remaining assets go
ing to the other heirs at law. the made
an application for anal distribution of the
estate -but was opposed in this by Z. S.
Kamp'e. a broker, who claims three lots
rear the park by virtue of deeds from
Mr" Kreling and her father-in-law.
\gainst this claim Lowenthal also set up
a. deed and Judge Troutt denied Kampe's
petition azainst that of Mrs. Kreling- on
technical grounds. On Tuesday morn in?
Kampe appeared with Choynski and filed
another petition objecting to the distri
bution of the estate on the same grounds
contained in the petition denied by Judge
Troutt An argument between Lowenthal
and Choynski "followed. Finally Lowen
thal lost'hls temper and said: "I believe
y^u ar* the crcokedest man at the bar.
Mr. Choynski." Choynski answered that
LowenthaVs dealings with the Kreling
estate clear through had been peculiar
and he said that it was his intention to
bring the whole matter before the Bar
Association. At this point Jud^e Troutt
interfered and ordered the attorneys to
proceed with the hearing. They proceeded
for a urn* and then an adjournment was>
taken. Believing that the pen in this case
is niig-htier than the f.st, although Lowen
thal is not physically strong. Choynski
will prepare a bill of particulars against
Lowen-thal which the Bar Association
wiil be called upon to peruse.
WELLS HOLDS UP
HEALTH BOARD
SALARY CLAIMS
Employes Must Go to
Court for Pay.
STATUTORY WARRANTS PASS
NO MORE CASH UNTIL THE LAW I
DECIDES.
Health Officials Claim Sight to Slake
as Many Appointments as They
Like, but Auditor Does Not
Agree "With. Them.
Last week the Board of Health served j
notice on Auditor Wells that it would â 
hire all the employes it -wanted to end |
that under the law he would be compelled
to honor their salary claims. Thi3 morn- ;
Ing Auditor Wei - will inform the Board i
of Health that he declines to audit any j
of the month's warrants save those of >
statutory employes: The horde of para
sites that has fastened itself to the board â¢
far no other purpose than to collect sai
ary and _â¢ the same time political lebti [
â will be forced to wait on the slow opera
tion of the law for payment if the law
eventually decides thai payment is just j
and due and the appointments legal.
In line with the careful policy he has j
been pursuing Auditor Wells called in i is i
attorney. General Dickinson, and asked
for his opinion upon the Question of rhe .
right cf the Board of Health to hire at '
will other than employes specifically pro- .
\-ided (or in the statutes. The Health
Board people contend that the law gives j
them the cower to employ as many pert i
sons as they may have need for and con- ;
sistent with their belief they have h:red
as many assistants as they could find
comfortable chairs for in their offices.
The Auditor, however, has not coincided
with them in this belief, and pending a. j
decision by the courts has held op a |
bunch of salary claims that will bring wo-?
to the claimants as well as a half dozen
acquisitive brokers. His action will com- â 
pel the board to bring 1 mandamus proceed
ings to take the Initiative in the legal con
troversy that will ensue.

The police took hold in earnest yes

W. Carroll, a well-known mining man,

to a complaint before Police Judge

I had been troubled with tetter for several
years. At times my hands would be sore all over,
ao that I rould not use them at all, and were so
tender that clear water, even, smarted like fire,
and it spread over arms, nock, and face. I had
been treated by physicians, but without benefit,
when I began the Cuticura remedies. 1 found
relief before I had taken the firnt bottle. I used
three or four bottles of Cuticura Resolvent,
one cnke of Ccticira Soap, and one box of
C'itjcura (ointment), and It has never troubled 1
me since. ELLA CURZON,
March 10, 1898. Epptngham, 111.
BLOOD POISON CURED

One of my children ran a rusty nai! into blÂ«

out of order, and sores broke out on his hands

'â¢Air. Thome said he must have the
$375 by 11 o-'clock tin- next morning, and
wanted me to promise then that i
would let him have it. i said no, that
I must first have a talk with my hus
band. 1 told Mr. Carroll that I did not
like that way of doing business, but he
Is not ac< ustomed to the ways of tlu
city and said, '1 guess it's all right. 1
don't think Mr. Thome would do any
. ni â  -ng.
"The next day we went down to
Thome's offic< and there we met Berry,
who was introd iced to us as the man
who would purchase the property. Mr.
Carroll paid oa r the $â â '.::, to Thome
and the latter passed it over to Berry

had better come out and look at the
property before you decide to buy it 1 "
â That i- ; not i iid. "Any
thing that is si to Mr. Thorne
suits me. 1 will have this matter <

"I did riot hear any more about the

everything was all fixed, but thai thej

ill l*n them have the money, but
they kept on roming after more at in
tervals of three or four \ve< ks although
they would ea wait a month or
t wo.
"I thought there was something
wrong, hut Mr. Carroll thought thai
after he had put the iirst few hundred
dollars out let them have more
in order t.i save the amount first ad
vanced.
"Finally Berry began to talk
in Chinatown. He did not
s;iy just what ii was, but t for
me in April last and said a party in
town owed him $80,000 and
to pay him the next day. but first he
must put up an assessment of $440. He
was to repay the loan the next morn
ing, but instead of doing so he
x- wn.
"I had met Sinu.it in Thome's office
on several occasions and h had often
rked that Berry was an honest
man. so after waiting around Tho
office for several hours 1 went to
Smoot's hi ' ' Berry's address.
Smoot directed us to a pla n Eddy
street or Golden Gate avenue, but, ai
though we searched the entire neigh
borhood, vve could get no trace ol
body "f that name. Then i threatened
in h:i\" Berry arrested, but .Smoot and
Thorne signed an agreemi nt to pay the
$4-!'"t if I would not prosecute him. They
: to keep their agreement and I
finally swore to the complaint. That
w its some days ago, but there was some
â¢ in the complaint and to-day I
swore to another."
Mrs. Carroll sai.i she n^ver met Davis
and never heard anything about a gang
of smugglers. She said, all told, Berry
and Thorne $3100 from herself and
husband, for which, with the exception
of the last, they gave their j- >i nt notes.
She said she had also loaned money to
Harvey Brown, but declared that, al
though she met him in Thome's office,
he was in no way connected with the
Thorne-Berry scheme.

Gibson and Wren at police headquar-

Harvey Brown, interviewed at Oak
land last night, .-ays he knows but lit
tle of the differences between Mrs. Car-
rol and William E. Berry.
â¢'I have met Mrs. Carroll," he said,
"and think Bhe is a very estimable
lady. The suit is based ><\\ ;i loan that
was made Berry, who represented him
self as a raisin grower in the Fresno
district. 1 am not at liberty to say
what may havp been Berry's purpose
in borrowing the money, for I have
nothing more substantial than gossip
and I will not repeat gossip.
"I do not think Berry and McPherson
are on the best of terms just now. 1
am McPheraon's attorney and so am
debarred from talking of the relations
between these people and my client.
That suit against Davis is based on
legitimate grounds and we are pre
pared to prove to the court that we are
not triflinar. Davis is a Northern man
and he collected a lot of bills due. Mc-
Pherson and did not turn in the money.
I am not at liberty to say what schemes
McPherson is fostering, but I do not
think he is in the smuggling business."
When Judge Brown sees Davis this
morning he will change his mind about
his being a Northern man. He will
recognize him as a man who was in
the San Francisco Police Department
from December, IS9I, until he resigned
in March, 1897. to forestall an inevitable
"breaking:" at the hands of the Com
missioners for financial peculiarities.
He may also "be able to identify him
as the man McPherson claimed was the
captain of a long, low, rakish, piratical
ever, that T think he dH us well as he
could under th>' circumstances."

The police connect the identity of
Davis with Clisham, through a chance

said boastingly.
For once "Brick" overshot the mark.
His boast, coupled with his associa

Clisham, in Portland Tuesday. He was
arrested and waived all formality and

that he had loaned a small sum of
money to "Brick" and had applications
for more.

said he had all kinds of money coming

received any interest, but he sent me
several boxes of cigars along with the

told me anything about his schemes to

I have not lost any money by him."
To the Holders of Island Sugar Stocks
Publication of rumors concerning the
'lava flow" on the island of Hawaii,
Hawaiian Tslnnds, has caused consid
erable inquiry about several planta
tions, and for the benefit of holders of
uni;;ir stocks and all others interested
we present the appended statement,
based on the very latest reliable ad
vlcea and knowledge of the topography
of the country:
Onomea plantation is many miles
from the conjectured stream of the flow
and at an elevation of several thousand
feet above the plate where the lava
would empty or fall into the ocean
should the eruption reach the sea.
Paauhau plantation is so situated
that this lava flow, to reach it. would
of necessity cross a mountain more
than 13.000 feet high.
Hutchinson plantation is on the other
side of the island from the point or
place that the rumors have located as
the spot for the discharge of lava into
the sea. This estate is one of the most
remote in every way from the reported
route of the flow.

LEES ASKS FOR
AUTOMOBILES
AND BICYCLES
Also Wants a Harbor
Patrol Boat.
â â * â -
IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED
HIS ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS A
YEAR OF GOOD WORK.
E
Efficiency of the Department at a
High Standard and the Chief's
One Aim to Attain Greater
Improvement.
The annual report of Chief of Police
Lees is an interesting document in that
it outlines to the Supervisors many im
provements in tne service that are pal
pably necessary. In it Chief Lees dwells
at length on tne need of a bicycle squad,
a patrol boat to protect the extensive
shipping in the harbor and automobiles to
supersede the present expensive patrol
wagons in the transportation of prison
ers.
6 Concerning these matters the report
says :
There are at present in actual use In this
department nine patrol wagons, each of which
is drawn by two horses, with two relief horses
to assist them. It must be apparent, at a
clance, what a drain the keeping and care of
these animals 13 upon the finances of this de
partment, and any measure which should look,
reasonably and practically, to the diminution
of this expenditure should. I submit, be re
tarded favorably. Modern mechanics has made
the bicycle an implement of exceeding useful
ness and in some cities. In some of their mu
nicipal departments. It is not unusual to find
bicycle squads organizedâ a suggestion which
should be borne In mind when, under the new
charter the park police fall within the Juris
diction 'of this department. I suggest this Idea
concerning bicycles for the purpose of leading
up to a further suggestion. If modern me
chanics can so Improve the bicycle until it be
comes the piece of exquisite workmanship
which we see every day there can be no doubt
that in the near future the automobile will he
so far Improved, both as to its mechanism and
as to Its cost, that it- will effect the super
session of the more expensive patrol wagon:
and. Indeed, no reason is perceived by me why
the mechanism of an- automobile might not be
applied to our existing wagons, thus obviating
the purchase outright, at the commencement, of
new vehicles. And. in addition to all this, the
operating expenses of an automobile, as com
pared with the care, and keeping of many
horses, is practically nominal. I submit this
suggestion to you tor your careful considera
tion. â  .*- -".â¢ "â¢
For the further efficiency of this department
a steam patrol boat for the water front Is
imperatively necessary. The commerce of San
Francisco is large and increasing: her water
front covers many miles; her shipping Interests
are very extensive and an enormous amount
of valuable property is located upon the shores
of this harbor. In other seaport towns the
police authorities are provided with adequate
steam patrol vessels; yet. I regret to say that.
In spite of repeated recommendations hereto
fore made by me and my predecessor, and not
withstanding the defenseless condition of our
large Interests upon the bay and along the
water front, this magnificent harbor is as yet
without even one steam patrol boat.
Concerning the work of the department
Chief Lees reports that the principal of
fenses for which arrests were made dur
ing the year were: Assault with a deadly
weapon, 196: assault to murder. 100; bat
tery. 1030; begging. 494; burglary. 259;
