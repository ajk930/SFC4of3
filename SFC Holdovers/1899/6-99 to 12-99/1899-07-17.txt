REFUSES TO
ARBITRATE THE
GREAT STRIKE
President Rossiter Defiant.
Brooklyn Trolley Cars
May Be All Tied Up.
NEW YORK, July President Rossiter said to-night that the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit officials would not arbitrate the strike difficulty
with their striking employes. s
"There is nothing to arbitrate." said Mr. Rossiter. "The men who
have gone out came to me with certain demands. I showed them that
they already had substantially all they asked for, and would straighten
out any injustice. They came in a fighting mood and were not disposed
to look at the subject dispassionately."
"How many men went out on strike this morning?"
"Between 700 and 1000. Not more than 1000 at the outside." ; â¢
"What about to-morrow?"
"All I can say is that we have enough" men to run every single trip
to-morrow and will do so if we are not interferred with. The normal
conditions will return in a day or two, I hope. Our success to-day in
conducting our business in the face of a strike is- almost unparalleled."
All the roads with the exception of three. Green and Gates, Halsey
and Putnam and the Fulton street lines shut down at 7 o'clock to-night
by order of President Rossiter. The three mentioned continued running
until midnight, when they were ordered to stop. President Rossiter said
he would open the lines again at 5 o'clock in the morning.
There was some trouble to-night. with a large number of people that
had taken the trolley car during the day for Coney Island by way of
Ulmer Park. They were let out at Ulmer Park, and being unable to
either get to Coney Island or to return to the city proper for many hours,
remained there and several small disturbances were the result.
General Master Workman Parsons spent the greater part of the day
in Brooklyn and a considerable portion of the afternoon was in confer
ence with Messrs. Delehanty and Webster of the State Board of
Mediation and Arbitration. Mr. Parsons said to-night in the course of
an interview:
"This strike was one that could' have been avoided. We are satisfied
with the showing we have made. I think to-morrow will see a paralyzed
condition of traffic that will make the people of Brooklyn realize the
strike is strong enough to speak for itself. They are running no cars in
the suburbs and are making all the show they can in this city."
Mr. Parsons had the sanction of the Knights of Labor, and the men
will receive the moral and financial support of that organization.
NEW YORK, July 16.â Another |
trolley strike is on in Brooklyn. |
So far it has not been as effec- j
tive as the strike of 1895. but
there is no telling how far
reaching it may become. For some j
weeks past the employes of the several i
lines" controlled by the Brooklyn Rapid j
Transit Company have been complain- j
ing that the management did not live j
up to the ten-hour law. The men de
mand a revision of the time tables at |
the different barns and also claim that j
they should be paid twenty cents an j
hour for overtime, which is equivalent
to 52 a' day, the price which they set
lor a working day of ten hours. Meet- ,
ings have been held daily and nightly
for the last week and it was inferred j
from the reports given out by the em- j
ployes and their advisers since Thurs- J
day last that while a strike was immi- j
nent, it would not occur for some days j
to come.
General Master Workman Parsons j
and District Master Workman Pines
had charge of the men's affairs and a j
strike was called at half-past 4 this |
morning. At this hour most of the
motormen and conductors of the Brook
lyn Traction Company's lines had com
pleted tbeir night trips, and the leaders
decided that this was -the most oppor
tune moment to begin what was ex
pected to be a stubborn fight with the
traction company. A heavy rain storm
was in progress at this time and there
was very little passenger traffic. The j
Smith street. Franklin avenue . and
Hamilton Ferry lines, which are con- ;
trolled by the Coney Island Railroad
Company, having maintained the regu
lar terms with their employes, were not
impeded in the least, but on all other
roads transportation was stopped for
a while and a good deal of congestion
occurred in consequence. !
Shortly after midnight -about 10.000
policemen from the precincts in Man
hattan and the Bronx districis were
conveyed to the different barns and
many were placed along the several
routes comprising the territory covered
by the Brooklyn Transit Company. Up
to half-past 7 o'clock there were very
few cars run over those lines and those
that were sent out from the different
barns were policed by two. three and j
four constables. '^'.ffff'i t .
On the Putnam-avenue line only a '
few men refused to work, and it was
noticeable that scarcely a half-dozen
of the cars in this division were policed.
The Flatbush and Bergen Beach cars,
the Nostrand avenue, Gates, Ralph and
Myrtle-avenue cars, as well as the
Third-avenue trolley, showed a meager
service in the early hours of the day.
but traffic on the old .Nassau lines,
which comprise the Fifth. Seventh ,
Park and Vanderbilt avenues and
Douglass and Butler street roads, was
practically at a standstill. The men on
the Nassau road were most determined,
and not one of the motormen or con- ;
ductors went to work. The cars re
mained Idle for several hours, but by 10
o'clock one-tenth of the regular rolling
stock was working. These cars were
manned by inspectors and linemen and
in fact oilers and helpers were pressed
into service so as to maintain a partial
running of the system. Many of the
old conductors and motormen reported
for duty on the Gates, Ralph, Broad
way, Myrtle avenue, Flushing and
Third avenue roads, and President
Rossiter said that shortly after noon
over fifty per cent of tie old hands were
at work on these lines. Later in the
afternoon the cars cm the latter roads
were running at intervals of ten min
utes, which meant that the service was
tripped about one-third. The heavy j
storm of the early morning was dissi- â 
pated about 10 o'clock and from that!
hour until well on in the afternoon the j
Sunday traffic, which is usually very
heavy to North Beach, Bergen Beach
.and to Coney island, filled the cars.,
' but the dread of trouble or disturbance j
..kept hundreds of people away from j
those seaside resorts!
Shortly before noon President Rossi- !
ter's private car Ampere started from I
the City Hall and made a round trip j
on the Traction lines. On- board were I
Chief Engineer Brockinridge, W. W. !
Wickes, President Rosslter's private i
I secretary', and Assistant Secretary I
"Van. Cott. Accompanying these were j
Headquarters ' Detectives Reynolds,
Harrington, Gray and Stoddard.
The Ampere, after running* to the
Flushing extension, went up Nostrand
o venue to Bergen Beach and returned
The San Francisco Call.
[ down Flatbush avenue, whence it ran
I to Coney Island." Coming back from
I Coney Island, the president's car trav
eled over the Fifth-avenue route, and
as it neared Twenty-third street and
Fifth avenue those on board found
their further progress impeded by a
stalled car near the Fifth-avenue barn.
Here a crowd of some 500 people, many
of whom were women and children, had
congregated, and the motorman of the
Ampere, Howard Jackson, was attack
ed by several men who were â¢either
strikers or in sympathy with them. The
motorman received some ugly bruises
on the headland legs. v. >v
Secretary Wickes was one of the
first to run te the man's -assistance and
he was finally rescued from the mob.
Six arrests were made and the track
was soon cleared.
Throughout the afternoon bowlders
and large pieces of granite were taken
from a near-by yard and placed on the
tracks in the vicinity of Greenwood
Cemetery, and the cars came along at
intervals of twenty and thirty minutes.
The further progress was delayed until
these obstructions were removed. No
sooner did the cars pass than the
I bowlders were laid on the tracks again
I and the police were unable to stop the
j efforts of the obstructionists.
During the day 300 additional police
were sent over from New York and a
close watch was kept all along the
Brooklyn Bridge to see that no person
could interfere with the trolley wires.
The only cutting -of wire reported to. the
Brooklyn police headquarters was the
partial destruction of the feed cable on
Flatbush avenue, but a score of line
men soon repaired this in a temporary
manner which sufficed to reopen the
line.
Late in the afternoon a conference
was held at police headquarters.
Among those present were Police Com
missioners York, Hess and Sexton.
Chief of Police Devery, Deputy Chiefs
McLaughlin, of Manhattan and McKel
lar of Brooklyn and President Rossiter.
General McLeer was also in attendance,
but he said that as far as he could see
there was no necessity for the calling
out of the militia or interference in any
way by the military.
President Rossiter said that he was
anxious to bring the patrons of the sev
eral lines back from the seaside roads
as soon as possible and had made ar
, rangements to handle the Coney Isl
and patrons as far as practicable by
trolley service, but that he had advised
his assistants to arrange ror the trans
portation of the majority of the Â£oney
Island crowd, back to the city over the
elevated railroad lines. The Police
Commissioners informed Mr. Rossiter
that his patrons and the public in gen
eral as well as the company's property
and all other property would be suffi
ciently protected by the police force. In
addition to this Commissioner Hess in
formed Mr. ; Rossiter that he thought
â  the sending out of his private car was
non-politic and to use his own words.
It was like "shaking a red rag in front
j of an enraged bull."
Several arrests were made during the
day among the ranks of the strikers
! and their sympathizers. b

CLAMOR FOR
THE LIFE OF
AN ASSASSIN
Residents of Birds Landing
Threaten to Avenge a
Shooting,
/"> UISUN, July 16.â Peter Olsen, pro-
prietor of the Union Hotel at
b^- Birds Landing, was shot and pro
prietor of the Union Hotel at
Birds Landing, was shot and per-
K_y haps mortally wounded at 9
o'clock this morning. His assail
ant was Harry H. Burtt, a recent ar
rival from Rio Vista, who ' leased the
hotel part of the business from Olsen.
The shooting took place in the street,
near the store of Bird & Dinkelsplel,
and. was witnessed by seven or eight
persons. Olsen received ' four wounds,
one through the body below the stom
ach, two flesh wounds on the hip and
a bullet in the knee. The weapon used
was a cheap self-acting revolver that
carries a 38-caliber cartridge.
There was some misunderstanding
between Olsen and Burtt and the latter
concluded to terminate his lease on
Monday. A dispute arose over the dis
position of two sacks of eoa* and Olsen
took offense at the remark made by
Burtt that there was "nothing but
thieves In Birds Landing." He shook
his fist in Burtt's face, and. according
to the version of an eyewitness, "was
shot down like a dog."
Immediately after the shooting and
while his victim lay bleeding and
groaning on the ground, Burtt walked
coolly across the street to the hotel
porch, drew a new supply of cartridges
from his pocket and reloaded his smok
ing weapon. During the few minutes
that intervened Henry Bird rushed into
the store and called the operator at Col
llnsvllle by telephone, telling him to
send Deputy Sheriff W. C. Jones there
at once.
Hardly had Mr. Bird concluded his
message when Burtt, with pistol in
hand, rushed through the small crowd
on the street into the store and took
possession of the premises. He stood
in a defiant and threatening manner,
warning those outside not to step in
side the door. He then walked to the
rear of the building, took down the
telephone and called up the Sheriff's of
flce at Fairfield, telling the officer that
he would surrender to nobody but the
Sheriff. While he was calling first one
office then another on the line. Officer
Jones Â«peediÂ«Â« on -hi*. way to .the
scene of the tragedy and just four
teen minutes after leaving Collinsville
he arrived on- the ground, having run
his horse the entire distance. He was
met in "front of the store by an excited
crowd which by this time had increas
ed to about twenty-five.
Lynching was freely talked of. but
Mr Jones, who is known throughout
the State as a fearless officer, succeed
ed in quieting the villagers temporarily.
Despite the protests of those without,
he walked into the store without even
displaying his own revolver and took
the desperado into custody. He placed
handcuffs on Burtt's wrists and at the
assassin's request took him over to the
hotel to talk to Mrs. Burtt before leav
ing for the County Jail.
Ten minutes elapsed before they were
ready to start and by this time loud
talking was being indulged in on the
street Threats of lynching were heard

on all sides and when the prisoner was
led out to the buggy Burtt was the
coolest man in the crowd. Jones lost
â¢no time in getting his prisoner away
from the excited residents.
While the attention of most _â â¢" the
crowd. was attracted toward the assail
ant, Olsen was not neglected. Imme
diately after the shooting he was car
ried to his home, about forty yards
, down the street, and as soon as the
telephone could be reached Dr. W. S.

ed. - He arrived shortly after noon.
Everything possible was done to relieve
the unfortunate man and an operation
failed to locate the bullet in his body.

chances for Mr. Olsen's recovery, the
principal danger being that blood pois
oning will result from the body wound.

Shortl" after being placed in the
County Jail. Burtt was seen by The
Call correspondent. He refused to make
any statement in regard to the shoot
ing, his only reference. to it being that
it was done in self-defense. He said
his full name was Harry H. Burtt. that
he was a native of Anderson, Shasta
County, where his parents resided, and
that he was thirty-one years of age.
Burtt is a married .man. He refused,
to have his photograph taken, saying
he did not wish to have any additional
notoriety.. He is a person of slight
build, blonde hair and mustache, is five
feet six inches in height and weighs
135 pounds. His complexion is very sal
low and he has the appearance of be
ing addicted to the use of opium.
After his arrival in Suisun Officer
Jones gave additional facts in regard to
the man. He said that during the two
hours' ride together Burtt had little to
say about the shooting or the causes
that led up to it. In regard to his past
history, he seemed somewhat communi
cative, and told of having been arrested
-in, -Stockton ..on a charge .of forgery
committed in Woodland. He also spoke
of having had some trouble in Sonora
while conducting a saloon in that, town,
but would not give any details. He re
marked to the officer while on the way
to the jail: " .
"You acted very funny, Jones, to
come into the store without â¢ a pistol
in your hand." -Â«s. V
Jones answered: "I did not need a
pistol* to take a little fellow like you,"
whereupon Burtt remarked:
â  "I am a dead shot and can hit the
size of a man's eye at twenty yards."
" Jones says that Burtt' is a person of
remarkable nerve and displayed a cool
ness at the time of the arrest that was
remarkable. He asked to have the

turned to him before leaving Birds

COACHES DERAILED
ON A HIGH BRIDGE
Soutijerr) Pacific Passenger Trail's
Narrow Escape from
Destructior).
DUNSMULR, July 16. â bad derailment occurred at Blue Cut, ten
miles south of Delta, at 10 o'clock this morning. The Oregon Express No.
5 was divided into two sections. At Blue Cut a bridge nearly 200 feet
long crosses the Sacramento River. As the second section ran on the
bridge the next to the last car turned the rail and left the track. The.
last car, a Pullman, also left the rails. The wheels of both cars cut
through the wooden ties and the cars rested on the steel part of the
bridge. The train stopped suddenly. The passengers were badly jarred
and a woman in the Pullman had her knee cut.
One of the coaches of the derailed train was the special car of Gov
ernor Geer and party. The bridge. ties were torn up and broken nearly
the entire length of the long bridge, while the two sleepers were nearly
demolished. That the cars did not topplg into the river is remarkable.
The passengers were transferred and the train proceeded, leaving
the wrecked cars on the bridge to be cleared by the wrecking train from
Dunsmuir. This will not be finished till- toward morning. The Califor
nia Express No. 6, due.. to leave Dunsmuir at fp. m., was held about. six
hours, but probably will arrive at the Oakland mole not that far behind
time. â¢ Â

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
ING HOTEL, WASHINGTON. July I*s.â I
The State Department has received the j
text of the German-Spanish treaty un- j
der which the Carolines, Palaos group -i
and the Mariannes (except Guam) are
ceded to Germany on payment of 25.000,- |
000 pesetas. Since Germany grants Spain
the same commercial and agricultural :
privileges as are to be enjoyed by Ger
man subjects, it is apparent that the
Berlin Government's chief object in ac- '
quiring the Carolines was to make them '.
a military base 'in the event of trouble '
in the Pacific.
There is further evidence of this in re- .
ports through military channels that ex
tensive plans are being made to repair j
and strengthen the obsolete Spanish de- !
fenses of the Carolines. The commercial j
side of the acquisition, however, is not i
being neglected, as â¢ arrangements have
been completed for a line of steamers to !
connect with all of Germany's important j
possessions in the East. The main j
clauses of the treaty 'read:
"The Imperial Government of Germany j
and the Royal Government of Spain have
agreed on the following points:
"Firstâ will cede to Germany the
Caroline Islands, with the Palaos group
as well as the Mariannes, except Guam,
in return for a money indemnity of 25,
--000,000 pesetas:
"Secondâ will grant to Span
ish commerce ana to Spanish agricultural
enterprises in the Carolines, Palaos and
Mariannes the same - treatment and the
same opportunities that it will grant
there to German commerce, and will
grant in the aforesaid islands to Spanish
religious orders the same rights and the
same liberties that it will grant to Ger
man religious orders.
"Thirdâ Spain shall establish and main
tain, even in time of war, a coaling sta
tion for the royal navy and merchant
navy in the archipelago of the Carolines,
another in the archipelago of Palaos and
another In the archipelago of Mariannes."
PUZZLING PHASES OF
BOUNDARY QIJESTJON
British â¢ Press Representations May
Cause Radical Action at
Once.
NEW YORK, July 16.â A Jpurnal special
from Washington says: The State De
partment will undoubtedly find it neces
sary to publish the recent negotiations on
the Alaskan piovisional boundary line be
tween Secretary Hay and Lord Salisbury.
Only such a proceeding can fully answer
the representations from time to time
made in the British press, and which, es
pecially of late, have developed a tone
distinctly threatening to this country in
case it does not adopt the Canadian view
of a provisional boundary line. This
statement, made by a State Department
official to-day, presents fairly the latest
phase of the boundary question. It is in
the air here that some action of a radical,
perhaps sensational, character, is to be
expected this week at the State Depart
ment. It would not surprise the country
to learn that*the State Deparment had
recalled from the War Department its.re
quest that Pyramid Harbor be not garri
soned. This would leave the order of the
Secretary of War instantly operative, and
the troopsâ battalion .of infantryâ
ready, designated for that post should.be
hurried to the frontier.
A State Department official said to-day
on this. probability: "This Government, in
sending troops, to Pyramid Harbor, will
not contravene any Canadian rights. On
the contrary, we will he merely sending
troops into our own territory. Of course
the State Department agreed not to send
troops to a post within our own jurisdic
tion, by request from the British Em
bassador, with the understanding -that a
modus Vivendi â¢ should be Quickly ' ar
ranged. This very request 'was a confes
sion oh the part of Great Britain that she
was helpless to prevent an outbreak If
America exercised her undoubted right to
keep her troops in sight of the Canadian
people along the line." Â»

San Ro~ue with ninety-eight Ameri

were found on the beach there.
Most of the miners had sold all their j

that the steamer St. Denis was due
there on July 5. The beach was covered
with hungry men. However, not one

fact, a committee organized by them
raised a purse of 1000 Mexican dollars !
and offered it to Captain Urgell to take

Later in the fall of the same year the

CADET LIFE AT CAMP
FALLON
CALL HEADQUARTERS, â  CAMP
FALLON* SANTA CRUZ, July 16.â
Every member of the League of the
Cross Cadets now encamped here is
enjoying his outing and attending
strictly to business.* One of the. strongest
reasons for the' cadets' contentment la
due to the excellent food they are re
ceiving. The sea breeze has had a ten
dency to give them appetite's, and the
dinner hour Is looked forward to with
pleasure. Again the tents are comfort r
ably arranged and pleasantly situated.
The first night in camp was, as usual,
an interesting one. The boys occupied
the evening hours with singing, music
and noise. When the signal for "lights
out" was given it was almost instantly
obeyed, but the sounds that emanated
I from the tents precluded all possibility
I of any one sleeping for some time. About
, midnight some of the more daring cadets
returned from their trips uptown and
I "rushed" the guard. Many of the be
; lated ones succeeded in doing this, but
some were caught and placed in the
guardhouse.
The first call of reveille sounded at 6:20
o'clock this morning and aroused the tired
but eager campers. Ten minutes later the
second call was sounded and tho minia
ture six-pounder announced that the
Stars and Stripes had been raised on the
lofty flagpole. During -the raising of the
flag- the regimental band played the na
tional anthem. Breakfast call followed
and the entire command marched Into
the Dolphin baseball grounds and partook
of the first breakfast. After breakfast
the cadets spruced up their uniforms
and accouterments and awaited the sig
nal for guard mounting. That j interest
ing ceremony was held in camp, dur
ing which the band played an appro
priate, air. Captain I. D. Dwyer of Com
pany D was elected- officer of the day;
First Lieutenant Al Hanky officer of the
guard, and Second. Lieutenant J. H. Shee
han supernumerary officer. The guard
was changed also, but the boys who had
been on duty during the night postponed
their sleep, as they had other plans in
view. K. ' 'â¢_.
An inspection of camp was the next
order carried out. Surgeon Major Mor
risey, accompanied by Captain McCarthy,
Captain Duffy, Sergeant Major Dorothy
and Hospital Steward Dan Murphy pass
ed through the camp and carefully exam
ined each tent. That the Inspection was
entirely satisfactory was apparent in the
report submitted to headquarters, which
was to the effect that Camp' Fallon was
in a sanitary condition. â â .''â¢_â  'â  ff
At 10:30 the regiment marched to the
Dolphin bathhouse, where military mass
was celebrated by Father Dempsey. The
ceremony was one of the most important
and impressive of. the day. A temporary
altar had been erected at one end of the
large hall and was decorated with cut
flowers a#d evergreens. .The cadets
marched in companies and took stations
facing the altar and each other. A large
number of residents and visitors to the
city attended the services. Instead of the
musical ringing "of the bell at the conse
cration and the sanctus the drum rolled.
Sabers were presented at command from
Colonel Sullivan, and the congregation
kneeled. At this juncture a member of
Company H, who was overcome by the
closeness of the atmosphere in the hall,
fell to the floor in a faint. With true
military precision he was carried into the
outer air by members of the hospital
corps. Dr. " Morrisey and hip assistant,
Dr. Sullivan, also stepped out and at
tended the sick soldier. Under their min
istrations he rapidly recovered, and de
spite his avowals of being ''all right" he
was placed on a stretcher and taken to
the hospital tent. The services, inter
rupted for the moment.- proceeded in all
solemnity. â  " , "
Father Dempsey read the selection from
plaint of her uncle. She told the Chief l
of Police that her uncle wanted her to
marry a young man whohi she did not
love, which she refused to do. The Chief
talked with the uncle and niece and final
ly sent the girl home, no charge being
preferred against her.

NEW TREATIES
GO INTO EFFECT
Changes in the Relations
With Japan.
â  â â¦â â
. . â¢ - - . .
. Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 16.â A new treaty
between the United States and Japan goes
Into effect -morrow, at which time also
new treaties between Japan and nearly all
of the countries of Europe and some of
the South American republics go into ef
fect. It is an event of far-reaching Im
portance in the relations between Japan
and the United States, as it does away
with the treaty methods which have been :
in vogue for nearly fifty years, and sub
stitutes an entirely new method of pro
cedure, ihe same is true in the relations,
of Japan with other countries. Taken as
a whole, the many new treaties which go
into effect to-morrow will place Japan on
an entirely different footing with the
world at large, as she Is recognized for
the first time as an equal in every respect.
The treaty with this country was made
November 22, 1894, in Washington, be
tween Secretary Gresham and Minister
Kureno, who then represented Japan
here. The changes it made were so far
reaching it was determined, the treaty
should not go Into operation until July
17, 1899. f
Jutaro ! Komura, the present Japanese
Minister in Washington, was seeri at the
Japanese legation to-day and gave an in
teresting outline of the more Important
â¢features of this arrangement. He said:
The 17th of July marks the turning point In
the diplomatic history, not only of Japan, but
of the Oriental countries in general. It will
bo- the first Instance in which the Western
powers have recognized the full sovereignty or
an Oriental state. This action of the .en
lightened nations of Europe and America shows
that If any country Is ready to assume a full
share in the responsibility and affairs of the
world at large, these old and enlightened pow
ers are ready to admit such a country to full
.comity among nations. So we regard the ad
vent of this treaty as a very important step
not only for Japan but for all the nations of
the East.
The countries with which Japan has made
new treaties are the United States. Great Brit
ain,' Germany, France, Russia Austria, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Belgium. Holland, Denmark,
Sweden and Norway, Switzerland and ' Peru.
All (it these go into effect to-morrow, .except
those with France and Austria, which are de
ferred until August 4. With most of these,
countries Japan had treaty relations before,
but they were* crude and unsatisfactory.
To understand the change, It is necessary to
look at the system under the old treaties. This
was essentially based on two principles, -, first,
that foreign residents in Japan shall enjoy the
privileges of extra territoriality, that is, they
should be amenable to the laws and jurisdic
tion of the Consul of- their own country and
not to Japanese Jurisdiction, and second, that
foreign residents in Japan shall be conflned to
certain open ports, outside of which foreigners
could not reside, own property, or engage' in
trade. The result was in effect about fifteen
or sixteen systems of courts in Japan, for the
purpose ot, trying foreigners who committed
offenses in Japan. Furthermore, most of the
powers claimed that Japanese laws were not
binding upon foreigners. For instance,' take
'our quarantine law. While it protected os
against our own people, yet there was no pro
tection in the case of an infected foreign ship.
The only exception to this refusal to recognise
Japanese law was the United States, which
recognized from the flrst the binding force of
the Japanese law. '
One of the bad â  effects of this system was
that foreign residents had entire Immunity
from taxation. The Japanese paid all the
taxes. â¢ All this has now disappeared and for
eigners have the same .priyileges as well as
. the same obligations as the Japanese citizens,
no more and no less. The first step In the
new system is to put an end to the old fiction
of extra-territoriality. by which foreign citi
zens were Judged by a different standard from
Japanese.
The second essential thing Is the opening 1 of
the entire interior of Japan to foreign resi
dents and trade. Until now there have been
only flve treaty ports, Yokohama, Nagasaki,
Kobe, Hakodate and Nigata. In those 'places
foreigners had been able to live, to purchase
property and to trade, b.ut outside of them
they oould not even travel without a special
permit. These flve places are an insignificant
part of Japan. Henceforth the entire interior
of the empire, with its populous cities and in
viting fields of â¢ industry, . is thrown, open to
foreigners. They may live anywhere, engage ln
any kind of business and will be assured of the
same protection to life and property that is
given to the Japanese. . ' .â¢ .
In bringing about the new system of treaties
drill, left Camp Fallon to-night for the
city. }_ His departure was keenly regretted
by the boys, among whom he Is extreme
ly popular. He hopes to return on Satur
day next.'
The famous, organization known as the
"Owls," composed of officers of the reg
iment, held their first seance in the early
hours this morning. Captain Bannon of
Company C received the flrst degree of
Initiation, being awakened from sound
slumber by being pitched out of his warm
cot. The "Owls" have been in existence
for the past three camps and during that
period have had plenty of pleasure stay
ing up late nights and bluffing the guards.
An Interesting session Is promised shortly, |
when a few more officers are to be in- j
itiated. There is no need of saying that
the initiation is interesting, as the candi- j
date ie asked to do many strange things. :
the following officers compose the organi
zation: Colonel Sullivan, Major McGloyn,
Major McCarthy, Captains Duffy and *
Monohan, Lieutenants Mahoney, Crowley
and Watts and Sergeant "Brindle" Mc- I
Ginn.
"Pot" Mahoney and Harry W. Crowley,
color sergeants of the League of the Cross i
Cadets, occupy the same tent. Last night j
Crowley, who acts as guard at the Napa j
Insane Asylum, dreamed that he was j
hustling a. patient to his ward, and in his ,
anxiety to carry out his duty he laid vio
lent hands on his. sleeping companion and
hustled " him around the tent until. Ma
honey, awakened' by the rough treatment, |
punched Crowley fn the ribs and brought
him to his senses. "Pot" has applied to
the colonel for another tent, giving as a
reason for the change that he thinks
Crowley Is dangerous.
Frank Smith, Frank Oneto, Eddie Doolin
and Joe Mohuni compose the "Goo Goos."
They are a happy If not boisterous band. â¢
The original "Owls" are very much put
out over an attempted Infringement on j
their name by another crowd in camp.
The only "Owls" claim that their name ,
has been copyrighted, and vow to sue out
a writ of something to prevent the Oppo
sition crowd from using its proud title.
The opposition "Owls" is composed of
members of the band. They are B. Con
nolly, Frank Pohl, "Bud" Schofleld and J.
Mcintosh.
Colonel Sullivan remained in camp to
day and received visitors. The commander
of the cadets is proud of his boys and the
order they keep In camp.
The concert in Camp Fallon last night i
was largely attended. The musicians j
played their best, and an excellent pro- j
gramme of popular and classical music i
was rendered. . ' > ".-â '_
Private Keane was around camp yester- \
day swearing that 'he never dreams.
The Call's headquarters tent Is one of !
the popular places in camp. The cadets j
take pleasure in dropping in and discuss- '.
ing the news of the day.
I Japan haturally feels most friendly toward the
United States, because she always has shown a
I most sympathetic interest in Japan's desire to
i adopt modern methods and to deal on even
j terms with the rest Of the world. The mes
, sages of several of the Presidents .have spoken
in - most friendly terms of 'this matter. And
so. as the Government and people of the United
States have taken such a friendly interest un-
I der the old system. I hope and believe the
I United States Government and people will take
a most friendly Interest in the carrying out
of "the new treaty. .

CHICAGO, July 16.â A special to the
Tribune from Bonesteel, S. D., says: Upon
the question whether his victim was brute
or human depends Archie Brewer's â¢ guilt
or Innocence of the crime of murder.
Brewer was one of the owners of a small
tent show. Among the attractions was a
creature of seemingly a higher form of
animal life than a monkey and lower than
a man. Brewer and Thorndyke called the
animal the "missing ,link" and laid great
stress on the alleged fact that no one was
able to say whether lt belonged to the
human or brute creation. Brewer now
avers that the freak was a monkey.
In a scuffle with it the showman became
angry and seizing a heavy club dealt his
antagonist a hard blow over the ear. from
the effects of which it died in a few hours.
The local authorities immediately placed
Brewer under arrest on a charge of mur
der. -At the preliminary hearing' his law
yers set up the defense that their client
did not take the life of a human being,
but the magistrate bound him over to the
Grand Jury.

OF McNAUGHTON
IS DEMANDED
Report Made by the San Jose
Normal School Alumni
Committee.
SAN JOSE, July IS.â The committee ap
pointed by the Alumni Association of the
State Normal School to investigate the
character of Principal McNaughton has
completed Its labors and to-day filed Its
report with Miss Elizabeth Blalsdel, sec
retary of the Board of Normal School
Trustees. The report will come up before
tho trustees at their meeting next
Wednesday.
Th.' committee states that everything
bears out the charges made, and suggests
that McNaughton resign. Guilty or inno
cent, his presence will be detrimental to
the school. A synopsis of the report fol
lows:
To the Honorable Board of Trustees of the
State Normal School at San Jose Ãespected
Sirs: The undersigned committee of the Alumni
Association of the State Normal School at San
Joee respectfully submits to your honorable
body the following petition:
At the last annual session of the Alumni
Association held on June 21. 1599, tin* attention
of the association was directed to certain
charges hereinafter .->et forth purporting to have
m made by certain citizens of Council Bluffs,
lowa, against Professor James McNaughton,
io T\as on June -, 1599. elected principal of
* Normal School at San Jose.
â¢"rior to the meeting of the Alumni Assocla
n tho charges referred to had been *;'.â¢â .
erable currency through a circular pur
rtlns to conuUn a copy of an article which
appeared in the lowa Normal Monthly of the
te of December, ISW), one of which circular*
has reached the committee and Is hereunto at
â¢â¢hed.
lie nature of the charges, as will ix? evident
im a perusal of them, made it the duty of
? Alumni Association to use its best and
rest efforts to arrive at the truth respecting
the same.' and. if founded on malice and
warranted, to aid In the vindication of the
incipal of our school. To have evaded the
uter at such a Juncture the association
deemed would have been little less than cow
lice. It was considered desirable by the
soclation to appoint i committee to gather
_h Information as was obtainable concern
_ the charces and ascertain their truth or
.Sit}'.
Ye greatly deplore the necessity for this ac
n that has confronted the Alumni Assocla
n. but in view of the serious menace to the
â¢d name of our school contained ln the
irges directed against its principal no other
path seemed open in the line of duty. Reluct
tly we have entered upon our work: we have
Seavored to faithfully perform the same, and
hope with consideration only for the truth.
We trust the report we now make will reflect
marily a sincere Interest in the Normal
:iool and Its welfare, and this without in
tice to any one.
hen follows In the report an extended
statement to the effect that Professor
McNaughton has allowed a published
itement to go uncorrected to the effect
thai he is a graduate of the University
of Michigan. A copy of a letter is ap
pended from Marion C. Goodrich, assist
ant registrar of that university, to the
eet that no such person as James Mc-
Naughton ever graduated there.
A copy of the charges, that have al
ready been published, is given in full.
They allege incompetency, immorality and
usury against Professor McNaughton. and
are signed by William Groenweg, James
McNeill, Willllam McCrany. S. B. Wads
worth. George Metcalf. K. E. Aylesworth,
D. B. Daily and G. A. Holmes.
It is stated that the charges
were spread upon the minutes of the
School Board if Council Bluffs prior to
October 16, IS9O, when Professor Mc-
Naughton handed In a written resignation
and the same was accepted by the board.
The report continues as follows, after
censuring Professor McNaughton for con
cealing all knowledge of the charges in
question from the Normal School Trus
tees prior to his election:
We ._â  of the opinion that the results of our
Investigation thus far infirm us in the follow
ing conclusions:
First â 'â¢ Professor McNanghton claims to be
a graduate of Michigan University, such claim
is nut verified by the registrar. If. on the other
hand, he did not desire to make any such
claim, he should have corrected that published
statement.
Secondâ When Professor McNaughton was
City Superintendent of Schools at Council
Blurts, la., the charges referred to herein were
made against him by eight reputable citizens
of that city, filed with the School Board and
spread upon the minutes of that body as a
permanent record.
Thirdâ Said * barges have never been Investi
gated by a competent tribunal or court.
Fourth -We deem It Impossible <_i. this late
date and at such a distance from Council Bluffs
to absolutely determine the truth or falsity of
such charges.
Fifthâ We consider that Professor Mc-
Naughton was derelict In not demanding a full
Investigation of the charges made against him
before some board or competent tribunal in
Council Bluffs, and at a time when the con
troversy arose or within a reasonable time
thereafter.
Sixth Whether or not Mr. McNaughton Is
guilt}' of these charges, the fact still remains
that he resigned his position In face of th.-m;
that although his accusers were wealthy men,
he never brought suit against any of them for
damages, or took any other active steps to
secure a retraction of the same.
Seventhâ this controversy concerning the
character and competency of Professor Me-
Naughton cannot fail but be detrimental to the
welfare of the Normal School of San Jose,
should Professor McNaughton remain In charge'
Eighthâ Professor McNaughton should
have advised the Board of Trustees of the fact
at least that these charges were outstanding
against him. for the reason that It Is evident
that charges of such a nature are not to be
lightly treated or contemptuously â¢ waved
aside when the selection of the State Normal
School is being made.
Ninthâ That the reason for the dismissal of
Professor McNaughton from the Superlntend
ency of Schools at Council Bluffs rested in the
fact that the charges hereinbefore set forth
were made against him. We are unable, In the
face of the affidavit of 8. R. Johnson of San
Jose and the statements of those whose letters
we present, to give credence to the assertion
that Professor McNaughton'a dismissal was
due to his opposition to the liquor element
We are no more willing to believe that Lucius
Wells, John Schoentgen and Senator Groen
weg were or are champions of the liquor
element than we are to believe the same of
Professor McNaughton.
We are of the opinion that there Is nothing
to warrant any one who was engaged In thÂ«
Council Bluffs controversy ln endeavoring to
bolster up his position by an appeal to the
antl-llquor sentiment. Such an appeal In the
matter, we think, only tends to cloud the mind
and divert attention from the real matter at
Issue.
The conclusion the committee of the Alumni
Association has reached, and which we deem
1_ substantiated by the foregoing report, is
that ln the best interests of the Normal School
Of San Jose Professor McNaughton should re
sign the position to which he has been elected.
If, as he claims, he Is Innocent of these charges,
he ls unfortunate, and his position would de
serve our earnest sympathy. Yet his misfor
tune. If such It be. should not be visited upon
the schools of California, and we submit that
Professor McNaughton, in the exercise of the
instincts of a teacher, will see that a lasting
Injury will result to the Normal School -at San
Jose should the princlpalshlp remain with one
whose character has been Impeached In the
past and ls still Impeached through the evi
dence submitted with this report.
Respectfully submitted, JOHN J. JURY,

Then follows In the report a number of
letters and affidavits supporting Its state
ments from the following persons: Mau
rice C. Goodrich, assistant registrar Uni
versity of Michigan; William Groenweg
of Council Bluffs, J. M. Reynolds of San
Jose, affidavit; S. R. Johnson of San Jose,
affidavit; Mrs. S. R. Morrlsh of San Jose,
affidavit; John Schoentgen of Council
Bluffs. The exhibits in the report close
with an extended affidavit of Lucius
Wells. He states that after Professor
McNaughton had been In the position of
superintendent of the city schools of
Council Bluffs for six years the dally at
tendance of the High School was be
tween forty and fifty. During the school
year recently ended the attendance was
'... there being a graduating class of
fifty-two. It is stated that the population
of the city has not Increased 15 per cent
since Professor McNaughton's Incum
bency of the office, It was stated further
by Mr. Wells that so far as he knew none
of the parties who had made the charges
against Professor McNaughton had ever
retracted them. As for himself, Mr. Wells
refers to twenty business houses and
banks throughout the country, including
tho Doers Implement Company of San
Francisco.
l! } / c /L ar . d t0 Senator Groenweg it ls
stated that he has been State Senator
in lowa for two terms, been talked of for
Governor and had declined many politi
cal honors. Mr. Wells refers to the West

Francisco, Castle Bros, of San Francisco
and Mr. Carrclton of the Marysville Can
ning Company. â  -
Wells 6 states" h!S mot,lres affiant, .Lucius
I have written this extended letter because I
think you are entitled to the facts. I do not
want to persecute Mr. McNaughton, and never
have been guilty of that attempt, but I do not
think lt right that pupils In any part of the
country should be under his control or Influ
ence.
These statements were sworn to before
Notary Public Casady at Council Bluffs
on July 11.
The report of the Alumni committee
closes with the sworn statement of S. B.
Wadsworth of Council Bluffs. He stated
that he knew Professor McNaughton
during his career there and at no time
did" he have the reputation of opposing
the liquor traffic.

expects the current to be available at this
point within eighteen months. A sliding
scale of rates for current is proposed, ac
cording to the time of day or night it is
used. From midnight to 4 o'clock p. m.
the current will be furnished so cheaply
that it will displace other methods of pro
ducing power, even the gasoline engine
or water-power.
The Peninsula Lighting Company, It is
understood, will make a proposition to
the town Trustees to sell current deliv
ered to any convenient central station at
rates that will make it advantageous for
the town to buy It.
There has been some talk In Palo Alto
of establishing a public electrical plant to
suppl/ power and light to the neighbor
hood. If this should be done, and at the
same time the Peninsula Lighting Com
pany should furnish electricity, compe
tition would be brisk and rates would
go down. To avoid this destructive com
petition it Is thought best by some of the
citizens to accept the Peninsula offer If
a good one be made, although the people
appreciate that no private company could
close a public plant that could be run In
definitely below cost, should the public
so elect. At any rate, .cheap lights seem
assured. <y ' ,

ADMIRAL MONTOJOii COAT.
Belie of the Late War Exhibited at
Palo Alto.
PALO ALTO, July 16.â Palo Alto now
has an Interesting relic of the late war
with Spain. It is the full-dress coat of
Admiral Montojo, commander of the
Spanish fleet at Manila. The coat is par
ticularly interesting because It was worn
by the admiral at a reception given the
night before the battle. This reception
"alls sharply to mind the grand ball at
Brussels Just before the battle of
Waterloo, only In the modern Instance it
was the conquered and not the conquerors
who .spent the night in revelry.
The coat Is made of the finest black
broadcloth, and ls elegantly trimmed with
gold braid an Inch and- one-quarter wide
and gold shoulder straps, and is lined
and faced with handsome red flannel. O.
B. McAfee, gunner's mate on Admiral
Dewey's flagship, the Olympia, secured
the prize and brought It with him to his
home In Palo Alto upon his discharge
from the service.

Defends Christian Science.
STOCKTON, July 16.â Frank J. Ryan, a |
veteran Journalist, who for twelve years
was editor of the Independent, has writ
ten a book in defense of Christian Sci
ence. The work Is a direct answer to the
various pulpit attacks made of late upon
Mrs. Eddy and her followers. Mr. Ryan
takes the ground that nearly all of the
great Protestant leaders, past and pres
ent, have believed In the system in one
form or another, and that lt is only the
lesser lights who seek to cast odium upon
it. The author quotes liberally from dif
ferent theological writers in support of
his position.
Killed by a Train.
MARTINEZ, July 16.â The engine of the

Ills special mission is to encourage coast
agriculturists to supply the home demand
for their products and to push out as
rapidly as possible for new markets In the
Philippines and Hawaii. He finds that
lowa Ib still shipping to the Northwestern
States quantities of butter that should be

"The Paclflc Coast has the greatest op

Agricultural Department is going to do
everything possible to aid in building up
Pacific Coast commerce. Congress will
give us all the money we need, and the
President wants you to feel that every

STEEP GRADES ARE
CLIMBED AND BAD
ROADS TRAVERSED
Through Rain and Mud the Auto
mobile Runs From Hudson
to Albany.
BY JOHN D. DAVIS.
ALBANY, July Rain played havoc with the roads last night
and we found on leaving Hudson at 1 o'clock in â  the afternoon that
trouble was in store. The* road to Klnderhook is of clay, and last
night's storm turned it Into about six inches of genuine Missouri gum
that clung to our tires and wheels tighter than a porous plaster. It was
necessary to proceed with caution, as the rear wheels continually slid
toward the gutter and threatened every minute to go over. There waa
not three miles of good road during the thirty seven miles covered.
While nearing Stuyvesant Falls we lost a nut off the valve on the
rear cylinder, and spent three hours and a half looking for it and
making a new one out of a thumbscrew. While doing this a hump
backed man came along and I rubbed his hump to throw off the hoodoo
that has stood by us since we started on the 13th. After that had we
had anywhere near favorable roads we would have made excellent time.
Between bad roads, darkness and horses of Sunday church-goers we
were over four hours making twelve miles. One or two small repairs
are needed and we will make them before starting to-morrow. It was
too late, midnight, when we arrived. AH these little annoyances only
strengthens our determination to make "San Francisco or bust."
HUDSON, N. V.. July Owing
to a heavy rainstorm that con
tinued until about 10 o'clock
this morning, rendering the
roads very muddy. Mr. and Mrs.
John D. Davis, the transcontinental
automobilists, did not leave Hudson for
Albany until 1 o'clock. During last
evening a machinist replaced with new
steel parts the defective brass petti
cock and controller, the breaking of
which at Red Hook Saturday seriously
delayed progress. A thirty-mile-an
! hour gait was taken by the motor in
| leaving town, and as the worst of the
j roads have b ;en passed a quick passage
|to Albany is expected. At Rossman's,
five miles north of the city, is a hill that
no wheelman can ride, its average
grade being about forty degrees, but
the motor climbed it with apparent
ease. Large crowds of enthusiastic
spectators witnessed the departure of
Mr. and Mrs. Davis.
ALBANY, July 16.â Bad roads ren
! dered almost impassable by heavy
rains and steep grades at almost every
mile tested the power of the automobile
to the utmost this afternoon. In spite
of it all, however, and in spite c* an
other slight accident, Mr. and Mrs.
Davis reached Albany Just before mid
night and were greeted by a delegation
of newspaper men and bicyclists.
"Our. trip from Hudson has been a
trying one," said Mr. Davis, "but the
motor Is now working smoothh' and is
down to its bearings. We will make
speed from noâ on if the roads are
fairly good. We got our best speed of
the trip to-day, taking into account the
horrible condition In which we found
the roads over which we had to travel;*
and if the way is as well prepared as
I am told there will be no further
trouble.
"We left Hudson this afternoon." he
continued, "for the purpose of getting
into a territory -where there ''are ample
telephone and telegraph conveniences.
It had been raining heavily all through
the night, and we were warned to ex
pect hard traveling, and we got it.
Just out of Hudson there is a two-mile
stretch of clay road that was like glue.
It clogged our wheels so that we had to
stop frequently to scrape it off. Then
we had to overcome slipping on grades,
and we did that too. A party of wheel
men who escorted us, made bets that
we could not climb Rossman Hill and
were the most surprised men In the
world to see the automobile mount it
easily In spite of the mud.
"Of course there was an accident, for
troubles never come singly. . Just be
fore reaching Stuyvesant the nut con
trolling the exhaust valve In the rear
cylinder, broke from the pin and got
lost. Our mechanic, Mr. Fisher, made
a new one out of a battery screw, but
we lost fully three hours by this mis
hap."
"Talking about luck," continued Mr.
Davis, "Mrs. Davis firmly believes we
are hoodooed by our starting on the
13th, and she actually got me to rub
against a humpbacked man at the de
pot to break the spell. It seemed to
work all right, for things have gone
smoother ever since, no matter how
much you may laugh about it. I want
to add while speaking of Mrs. Davis,"
that she is standing the strain of the
trip wonderfully well and will be over
feeling tired . when we get to going
smoothly as we expect hereafter.
"What do I think of New York State
roads? They are about as bad as could
be made as far as we have come. We
we. t several miles out of our course on
the advice of farmers, whom we met at
Coxsackie, and did not find much of
an improvement after all. The mud

CHICAGO. July 16.â John P. Altgeld
has received a message from Hon. Will
iam J. Bryan In which Mr. Bryan says he
will speak at the "Chicago platform mass
meeting," which will be held In the Audi
torium on July 20, the date of the meeting
in Chicago of the Democratic National
Committee. __B_pM_aH_a___q|
According to the Tribune the supporters
of Mayor Harrison had strongly hoped
Mr. Bryan would refuse Mr. Altgeld's In
vitation, and even wrote to Mr. Bryan,
setting forth reasons from the point of
view of the Harrison side why Mr. Bryan
should not speak at the meeting.
Mayor Harrison has been Invited to de
liver an address of welcome. He is In
vited as the Mayor of Chclago, and not
as a Democrat. "Mr. Harrison is Mayor
of our city," said Mr. Altgeld, "and it is
only proper that we should Invite him to
welcome the visiting Democrats."
WILL INVESTIGATE THE
MORMON SETTLEMENT
Reports Circulated That Polygamy Is
Being Practiced in Mexican
Colonies.
CHIHUAHUA. Mex.. July . 16.â Several
years ago prominent officials of the Mor
mon church of Salt Lake City visited
Mexico and obtained from the Mexican
Governrvant a valuable concession for the
establishment of Mormon colonies in this
State. The colonists came direct from
Utah and located In favored localities
north of here. They have prospered.
Reports have been in circulation for
some time that members of the colonies
are nractlclng polygamy contrary to the
Mexican law. It is understood that an
investigation has been ordered by the
Mexican authorities. Apostle Brigham
Young of Salt Lake City, the eldest son of
the former head of the Mormon church,
Is on his way to visit the colonies in this
State. The total number of colonists ls j
about ten thousand. . .
Wanted l>y Two Congregations
. STOCKTON, July 16.â 1t Is understood
here that Central Methodist Episcopal
was about six inches deep everywhere, |
and we had a heavy rainstorm part of j
the way in addition. When we reached j
Rensselaer our makeshift repairs failed
us, and the machine had to be mended
before we could cross the bridge to
Albany. Otherwise the automobile
would have reached the capital an
hour sooner. It was dark, but we
managed to get in shape to end our
trip for the night in a comfortable lo
cality. We find many pleasant mes
sages awaiting us, and assure our
friends that they are very welcome."
As to his plans for to-morrow Mr.
Davis said: "I shall have the auto
mobile cleaned and put in thorough
order at once, and expect to start by
'noon l.': the latest. lam told that there
Is a first-class Â»-oad from Albany to
Utica and we mean to make the most ;
of It. By noon the effects of the rains
ought to have about all gone so that the
mud will no longer interfere with our
travel."
In spite of the late hour of their ar
rival a laree number of Albanians
gathered about the Hotel Teneyck to
view the automobile, which had asily
climbed the wet and slippery pave
ments of State-street hill. A large dele
gation", of wheelmen and others inter
ested In the coming mode of travel
have been waiting impatiently for sev
eral days to see the automobile, and
will call on Mr. Davis in the morning.
DENVER, July 16.â "1 do not think
the trans-continental mobile will have
any difficulty whatever in crossing the
Rocky Mountains." That was the
statement made by State Engineer Mc-
Cune yesterday. Mr. McCune had read
of how^the automobile had climbed
Nelsons Hill, near Peekskill, N. Y.
"If there is no mistake In that ac
count, the automobile will easily cross
Colorado," continued Mr. McCune.
"The State roads of Colorado do not
exceed fifteen per cent in grade, and
we are now building all the State roads
not to exceed a ten per cent grade.
There are in the State only a few roads
of twenty per cent grade, and they
are byways. We do not designate them
as wagon roads. If the automobile
easily climbed Nelsons Hill, It will race
over the Colorado roads, whether in the
mountains or In the valleys. I do not
think the carriage will have the slight
est trouble in getting through- this
State. There are so many different i
routes it could take that it would be
difficult to say -which was best. The
route can be selected after the auto
mobile has been given a little more ex
ercise, and it is better known what it
can accomplish. The trip will be a big
advertisement for Colorado, as it will
show the East that ou>* toads are not so
bad as half of the roads In the East."
Church of San Francisco is trying to se
cure Rev. W. C. Evans of this- city to
fill the vacancy to be created by Rev Dr
Locke's removal to Buffalo. Dr. Evans
has been in charge of Central Church here
for two years, and the congregation would
regret very much to lose him. Dr. Evans
says he has heard nothing of the pro
posed change, and that the matter would
rest solely with the bishop and presiding
elder.

THROAT AND* LUNGS.
The New Theory Sop Diseases of the Air Passages. A Word :
From an Old School Physician as to Its Merits.
There are many systems of medicine by which we attempt to heal the human
body, and make it free of disease, ranging from the science of Allopathy down to that '
of Hydropathy. How far they have succeeded time has abundantly shown by the
number of their failures, as well as by the number and nature of their cures.
In the cure of pulmonary disease. Dr. Aborn has stepped out of the old beaten
track, and adopted a system so simple, direct and natural as to recommend Itself to
all who are suffering from catarrh and disease of the lungs, of a character defying
cure by any of the old methods of treatment.
Although from childhood I have been raised, and also went through a regular
.course and graduated as an Allopathlst, yet a strict love of what Is right and best,
as well as PERSONAL BENEFIT RECEIVED BY THE NEW SYSTEM as practiced
by Dr. Ahorn, teaches me to bear some testimony to Its merits for the benefit of suffer-
ing humanity. A. FALCONER, M. D., Lawrenceville, Pa.

To Whom It May Concernâ Having been a sufferer from catarrh and a severe
bronchial affection for more than seven years, and having found great relief by
submitting myself to Dr. Aborn's treatment for a few days only, I take pleasure In
saying. Dr. Aborn with his new and improved instruments for local application to
the lungs, air-passages, eyes and ears, should encourage all who are afflicted in '.
those parts to cherish a lively hope that they may find quick and permanent relief.

1 can freely say of Dr. Aborn, to whom this letter is given, that I have for him *
high esteem as a gentleman and as a physician. 1 have been for some time ac- '

straightforward in business, and prompt in action as ln promise. As a physician he *
has in this city, where he sojourned during the summer, given proof of great, if not 'â¢
remarkable, skill. I am acquainted with many of the persons in this State whom he '
has cured of diseases that were considered incurable, and have been at several times !
a witness to his ex_.ertness in difficult cases. J. S. CLARKSON, Editor Register. ,

I have been afflicted with severe nasal catarrh for two years, -which a fare :a?*iÂ»bÂ» ',

health generally. I have been under the treatment of Dr. Aborn for about three â

SAN FRANCISCO, February 19, 1870. _
Were lt not for the good which I hope it may have done to suffering humanity by
informing them where they could find relief, I should regret having given Dr. Aborn
my little testimonial of the 10th January, for the demands made upon my time in
answering inquiries in regard to him have been more numerous than profitable to me:
and still they come.
To save the necessity for further personal" application, let me say to those who
care for my opinion that time has only strengthened my first favorable opinion of Dr
Aborn, and my confidence in
THE PERMANENCE OF THE CURE
Effected by him. All my difficulty arose from catarrh, which had become of a serious
character, affecting the hearing and the throat, giving me at times acute pains and at
others rumbling sounds In the ears, frequent headaches, and so seriously affecting the
bronchial tubes as to sometimes disable me from public speaking. It is all gone and
the change was produced, not by the absurd practice of putting medicines into the
stomach, which was not affected, but by the skillful application of medicinal remedies
directly to the parts which were diseased. I have found the Doctor a gentleman li_ his
intercourse and business, and the judgment that I have formed of him professionally
Is, that he is a regular physician, thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of the hu- '
man body, and possessing a remarkable degree of skill ln the treatment of those
diseases which he makes his specialty. â  CHARLES N. FOX.

DR. ABORNâ Dear Sir: I have thought that possibly you might be pleased to '
know the condition of the little school girl. Mary Morris, whom you treated some
months ago at my request, and who, you will remember, was nearly deaf and seri- '
ously afflicted with some bronchial trouble when she went to you. She ls now en- " 2
tlrely cured both of deafness and bronchial affection, and declares that she was Â«
substantially cured on her flrst visit to you. She and her parents are very grateful '
to you,, and think it is wholly due to your skill that her hearing and health are re- '<
stored. Yours truly, R. P. CLEMENT, , ;

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: ' ;
The undersigned, a resident of the city of Dcs Moines for the past thirty-seven '
years, desires to bear testimony to the skill of Dr. Aborn In the treatment of pul- '
monary and kindred complaints. About the year 1876 I was very seriously afflicted '
with bronchial and lung troubles; in fact, had two or three quite severe hemorrhages !
and my left lung was practically useless. Dr. Aborn treated me constitutionally and â¢
by local inhalation applications, and within two months' time I was practically '
cured. I continued the treatment for some time longer and have never suffered a day !
since from any trouble of the kind. And my lungs and bronchial tubes have been '
sound, I believe, as any one's could be, and are at the present time, after a lapse '
' of twenty-three years. I have known the doctor and of his successful practice for the i <
past thirty years. ,
During the doctor's practice at that time I personally knew of a number of people *
whom he treated with pronounced success. From my awn personal experience and '
observation of his treatment of others I .believe the doctor to be capable of doing a '
great good to persons afflicted with such troubles. Very respectfully. <

I hereby wish to bear testimony to the skill of Dr. Aborn In his specialties '
About thirty years ago the doctor treated my daughter for deafness and disease '
of the ear and gave her instant , relief, and soon effected a permanent cure She *
remains well to-day after thirty y;ears, the hearing being restored and the diseased 2
ear cured. At the same time I knew of other cases that he treated equally as sue- 2
cessful as that of my daughter. Very respectfully, B. F. ALLEN. '
"While There Is Life There Is Hope." \
Dr. Aborn Is prepared to give the afflicted the most approved modern scientific <
treatment for the various diseases embraced in his specialties. With his improved *
facilities and. large experience in the treatment of throat and lung diseases nasal : *
catarrh, diseases of the eye and ear, affections of the digestive organs, nervous svs- *
tern, etc. Dr. Aborn Is prepared to treat with almost unfailing success all such -
cases as may come under his care. None should despair, no matter how severe or '
aggravated their cases may be. i
. Dr. Aborn has given abundant and substantia] evidences of his wonderful sue- 2
cess in restoring his patients to perfect health after all the ordinary methods have <
failed. The parties from whom Dr. Aborn has received the most flattering testi- .
monlals are well known and influential citizens, who have given their cards to the <
public, not only because of their gratitude to Dr. Abojji. but with the sincere desire <
to benefit their fellow sufferers, by assuring them thatTiealth and happiness, through _

ENGLAND (3ND AMERICAN GOLD.
HAD it not been for the sudden increase in the
Bank of Eng. nd rate of discount from to 3 1 â¢_
per cent and 4 / 2 per cent for short advances the
past week would have passed without a ripple
on the smooth commercial sea, which, as far as this
country was concerned, was a vast expanse of
monotonous prosperity. But the action of the "Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street" arrested the attention
of American financiers, for, like a two-edged sword,
it is liable to cut' in almost any direction and lead to
unforeseen results. As the financial situation in Eng
land produces more or less effect on trade condi
tions in this and other countries, it is not amiss to see
how that country stands.
The advance in the rate of discount was caused by
a lack of gold. Last year at this time the bank's re
serve stood at Â£25,000,000, or $1,250,000,000 in
American money. At that time England was calling
in money from Germany and paying America for her
wheat, cotton and other produce largely in-. securities.
But this year the tables are turned: England now has
no balances in Germany, and as she returned the
major part of our securities last spring this mode of
payment is no longer open to any marked extent.
Add to this heavy reductions of the reserves of the
New York banks of from Â£9,000.000 to Â£1,000,000, the
impending call of the Japanese for their gold loan,
the continued outflow of cash into the South, the
French competition for gold in the London market,
the prospect of heavy payments to the United States
for grain and cotton as soon as the crops begin to
move, and the inability of the bank to obtain gold
abroad except to meet interior requirements, and it
will be seen that the "old lady" will have to do
something to induce the American banks to keep
gold on her side of the ocean, or else pay the Ameri
cans for their produce in that gold which she finds
so short at the moment. Hertte-the advance in the
rate of discount, which, it is hoped, will keep the
gold in England. The- outto'ok at present is that
there will be* few gold exports from the United
States to England in the near future, though, .of
course, some unforeseen condition may arise to
change the present complication.
The gist of all this is that at the moment we arc
England's creditor. We are going to ship her large
quantities of farm produce which she must have, and
for which she must pay in some form or other. She
cannot do this by selling us back our stocks, for she j
sent most of them back some time ago. Ergo, it is a
case of gold coin. As a gross proposition this is im
mensely in our favor, but the net proposition shows
a different aspect, and that is, owing to the intricate
intimacy of the two countries' in commerce and
finance, what affects one is bound to affect the other.
In other words, while we might profit temporarily
by a commercial mishap to England, it would re
bound against us later on. As this condition is fully
recognized on both sides, of the water, it forces New
York to adapt her financial condition to those of
London as far as is consistent with our own pros
perity. The cord that unites these commerical
Siamese twins must be kept intact. But we have an i
astute set of financiers in New York, and they will
probably manage the- thing somehow so that the
United States will be able to pay a dividend or two
out of the transaction. They generally do. ' At any
rate, this country is the arbiter at the moment. "
The condition is but another proof of the im
mense prominence of the United States in the com
merce of the world. We are becoming- a large
creditor nation, and must be considered in all inter
national affairs. It is this fact which has caused the
advance in the rate of discount of the Bank of Eng
land. â¢ â¢
Another interesting fact in trade last week; was the
increase in bank clearings c?f 60.9 per cent over the
same week last year. Of eighty-two cities and towns
reporting clearings' "only fourâ Milwaukee, Spring
field, Mass., Buffalo and Chattanooga reported a
decrease. This shows a general wave of prosperity
throughout the country.

LET US KNOW THE TRUTH-
* I pZ^X-SENATOR EDMUNDS in his. article on
= j the Philippine situation says that secrecy is un
-1 â 'becoming in the officers oori r a republic and that
" suppression of the truth and misrepresentation of
facts are still less tolerable. Speaking for our most
; honorable history and traditions and for the people
who desire to preserve them both untarnished, ie
says, "Let us know the truth."
We have already protested against. a censorship of
the news and a violation of the mails which keep
j the truth away from the people, who are paying
l $800,000 a day and giving the live? of their sons in a
j war that Congress never declared but which is prov
Â» ] ing the second of all our wars in cost.
1 An officer in the Oregon Regiment, who like many
1 j others waits for muster out to give the authority of
' his name to his statements, says: "The Filipinos got
1 from Dewey the impression that he came to give
j them their freedom. Next came General Anderson,
who treated Aguinaldo as the head of a republican
government and gave the impression that he had but
one object there, to drive out the Spaniards and re
j tire. Then came Merritt, who treated Aguinaldo as
j a brigand. Then came Otis, who gave the Filipinos
1 every latitude. In Manila were 1500 trained Filipino
j soldiers, who begged to be allowed to join our army,
j but Otis drove them to the enemy. Otis is a great
! office man. When it comes to saving ip cents he is
1 a great general. He devotes most of his time to
! finding out whether some clerk is entitled to rations
ior not. It will take a hundred thousand men to con
-1 quer Aguinaldo. The sick and wounded can never
be expected to recover in that climate. Facts do not
warrant the rosy reports sent home. These islands
will cost a great many millions and ten thousand
I lives. The hospital facilities should be increased at
i once."
There could hardly be drawn a stronger picture of
i a disgraceful situation. After the treaty of Singapore,
I made by Consul Pratt and ratified at Hongkong by
. Dewey and Wildman, there is no doubt but the Fili
j pinos were treated as a national entity and given to
understand that they were our allies. The conduct
j of Dewey and Anderson confirms this view.
In October, 1898, Paymaster Wilcox and Cadet
I Sargent, on behalf of Admiral Dewey, made a tour of
j the island of Luzon and their observations were offi
-1 j cially reported. They found the people friendly and
I very happy in their independence, oblivious to things
" j in the outside world, but alive to the expulsion cf the
I Spaniards from Manila, the declaration of the' Phili
pâ  I pine republic and the Presidency of Aguinaldo. The
j report is full of praise of the intelligence and kindness
jof the people. At the town of Aparri the news had
' j come by steamer from Hongkong that our repre- j
1 sentatives at Paris favored the independence of the J
islands with an American protectorate. Colonel I
. ' Tivona thereupon surrendered his military command
Ito a civil officer. The latter made a speech in which j
' j he thanked the disciplined troops and their colonel [
'. I for services to the province and republic, and assured
j them that their services would be perpetuated and
J that every man, woman and child stood ready to
! take up arms and defend their newly won liberty and
resist to the last drop of blood the attempt of any
j nation whatever to reduce them again to dependence. |
He then placed his hand on an open Bible and took |
; the oath of office. If all these things had been known
j to our people, and if the facts of the undeclared war
i which is still on had been frankly given out, an im- ,
I perial sentiment would never have crystallized.
There is every evidence that the sentiment of the
' volunteers has been mendaciously misrepresented.
! One of the privates in the Oregon regiment says:
"You see, we didn't volunteer to fight these Filipinos. ,
We went out to fight the Spaniards, and when the '
I Spanish war was over we thought our trip was up '.
; and we had a right to come home. The other volun
teers-down there are of the same mind. I don't think
'â  a single volunteer company in the Philippines would
i stay an hour if they could get home, and most of the I
I regulars feel about the same way." \
Let the people have the truth. It will be more to
j the credit of the administration to tell it now than |
I to continue censorship and violation of the mails and I
let the returning volunteers shock the country into a j
political reaction. Anything being done officially by
an administration that is kept from the people is
something it has no right to do.
THE COMING AUTOMOBILE.
A BAD start makes a good ending," says the
proverb, and if there be truth in it The Call-
Herald automobile will come into California
with colors flying, make a record run across the
State and arrive at The Call office in triumphant
demonstration that long-distance journeying over
American roads by the new vehicle is feasible.
Proverbs are not to be relied upon in all cases.
There is always, however, some foundation for them
in the common experience of men, for .otherwise
they would never find sufficient acceptance to be
come proverbs. The bad .start of the automobile,
! for example, will have a tendency to bring about a
good ending by the very fact that it puts the mechan
ism to a severe test, reveals its weak places and
shows exactly where alteration and strengthening are
needed. With every breakdown a way is provided
for improving the machine, and by the time it crosses
the Missouri the automobile ought to be in good
shape to make the rest of the journey without a seri
ous derangement of any part of its machinery.
The record of Saturday's run shows the various
difficulties which the machine has to contend against
in making a long journey and taking the t roads is
they come. Considerable speed had been made along
a good road and everything was seemingly all right,
when a portion of the road that appeared solid and
strong gave way and ran the machine into a ditch,
very nearly upsetting it. The jar of the shock
snapped a brass casting that controls the valve on the
tear cylinder. The break was repaired with solder
and a new start was made, but as soon as speed was
developed friction melted the solder and a new delay
occurred.. . .
In the journey of the day some of the roads were
good and some were execrable. There were long hills
to climb and all kinds of roadbed to be traversed.
Despite the obstacles, however, and the accidents, a
single one of which caused a delay of three hours, the
record of the day showed a run of fifty-seven miles
upon a consumption of five gallons of gasoline. So
far as speed and the extent of mileage covered are
concerned the record is not one to boast of, but it
shows that the machine can climb hills and make
headway over all kinds of American country roads.
With the weak parts of the machine strengthened,
and with a freer motion in all its parts resulting from
their use, there are ample reasons for expecting the
record of the journey to improve as the automobile
comes West. ; ''Â-â /'.'
One feature of the run is worth noting. A long
'stretch of thickly settled country has now been trav
ersed and yet hardly runaways have been caused
by the appearance of the machine along the roads.
In the run from Poughkeepsie to Hudson on Satur
day not a single accident of any kind was reported. It
i appears then that the danger of frightening horses by
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, JULY IT, 1599.
the machine is not so great as was feared. Of course
there will be many accidents caused in that way when
the machine comes into general use, for some horses
will shy at anything that is unusual, but there will be
nothing like the wholesale stampede of panic-stricken
horses along the highways that some people fear.
CHANGES IN RURAL ENGLAND.
| â ;VER since the repeal of the corn laws and the
EVER since the repeal of free trade laws and dis
adoption of a policy of free trade the rural dis
tricts of England have been declining in rela
tive value to the urban districts. The changes were
slow at first, but with the increasing facilities for the
importation of farm products from abroad they fol
lowed one another more rapidly, until now the situa
tion is so different from that which prevailed in for
mer times as to amount to something like a revolu
tion in the social structure of the kingdom.
The landlords were ; formerly an aristocracy of
wealth and power. Their large landed estates rented
to tenant farmers brought them in vast revenues "and
enabled them to maintain, in addition to their, man
sions in London, those stately country seats sur
rounded by spacious parks which have been the ad
miration of every traveler, and have made English
country life something like an ideal earthly existence.
As the competition of American farmers increased
the incomes from British farms diminished, the de
mand for them fell off, and the revenues of the land
lords decreased. A considerable number of the great
estates have been broken up and sold. In other cases
the owners of castles have had to close them, be
cause of a lack of money to maintain them. So ex
tensive have been the losses of the lords in this way
that a recent writer on the subject estimates that
about three out of every four members of the nobility,
whose wealth consists chiefly of agricultural land, are
in such financial straits they can hardly maintain their
town houses, much less keep up their big establish
ments in the country.
It is stated that the number of agricultural labor;
ers in the rural districts of England has decreased
as much as 12 per cent during the last twenty years,
although the population of England and Wales as a
whole during that time has increased by more than
6,000,000. In a considerable number of rural villages
the population is less at present than it was during
the middle ages. The inhabitants of rural England
are moving in a mass to the cities or are emigrating,
by reason of a lack of profitable employment on the
farms.
Such is one of the results of free trade. A great
industry, the most essential to a nation's welfare, has
been virtually destroyed by a policy designed to aid
the manufacturers, and now the United States and
Germany are beating manufacturers in their own
markets.' Cobdenism, in fact, seems about as dis
astrous to Great Britain as could be any policy de
vised for the express purpose of wasting her wealth,
breaking down her industry and destroying her em
pire.

A SENSELESS REPORT.
A REPORT from Boston announces that there
is being organized in that city an "uprising of
the colored race against the administration at
Washington." The object of the organization is said
i to be the defeat of imperialism and a maintenance of
the rights of the Filipinos, and it is added that while
the plan of the movement is a revolt of colored voters
! from the Republican party at the ballot box, "there
are those among its supporters who would willingly
take part in an armed uprising, and who, were it
possible, would offer their strength to aid the Fili
pinos in their struggle for independence."
A report of that kind is about as senseless a lie as
the jingoes have yet concocted in their efforts to
discredit the conservatives who are upholding
! American republicanism against the jingo craze for
adopting an imitation of British imperialism. That 3
number of colored men in Boston have organized for
the purpose of opposing imperialism may be, and
very likely is, true. That they may, aim to organize
allied associations among colored men throughout
the country may also.be true. But that any con
siderable number of representative colored men arc
: organizing to fight the administration or to aid the
Filipinos by an armed uprising is altogether mi
i credible. It has not even an appearance of truth. It
| is a lie that stalks forth boldly in the garb of a lie.
Considerable efforts have been made to misrepre
-1 sent the attitude of the administration toward the
Philippines. Jingoes have sought to make the Presi
' dent appear as one of themselves. Bryahites seeking
'. to array the masses against the administration have
denounced him as if he were a jingo. Thus when the
, colored men organize to protest against jingoism
i they are at once described as instigators of revolt
against the President and are accused of a willingness
i to break out into open and armed insurrection.
What comes next? The jingoes are resourceful'
; liars, but can they ever excell what they have now ac
complished in that direction? The picture of plotting
j negroes organizing for an armed uprising in the
I United States for the purpose of aiding the Filipinos
j is really about as senseless a thing ss could be con
! ceived even by the imagination of a lunatic.

IN THE OIL, GOLD
AND COPPER FIELDS
The steady Increase in oil production in
Southern California, the rapid increase
of the men and money the industry is en
gaging and the big San Joaquin Valley
oil boom will make of especial interest
the report on a large oil-producing re
gion in Southern California which is be
ing prepared for publication by Field As
sistant W. L. Watts of the State Mining
Bureau. i . -'yy?
The report, which will be published as
a bulletin, will embrace the results of
two years' labor .by Mr. Watts in Los
Angeles and parts of San Diego, Ventura
and Orange counties. It will describe the
geological, formations yielding oil, their
relation to other rocks and the structural
conditions unuer which oil is found and
will give statistical Information as to the
production iof the . different fields and
wells during 1897 and .1898. The report
will not touch on Santa Barbara County.
Regarding the condition of the indus
try down there Mr. Watts said in a gen
eral talk: "There is much more pros
pecting and development going on than
ever before and the industry 1 will con
tinue to steadily grow. In the Los An
geles field there are two strata of oil
earing sand. The wells reaching only To
the first stratum are about played out,
while the deeper ones are still producing.
The development of the eastern exten
sion of the field in 1898 made up for the
falling off in the old ground. There is
much prospecting in the Buente Hills,
where four or more new companies have
developed paying wells. The Buente,
Santa Fe, Central, Home, Rex and Co
lumbia companies are operating there.
The Santa Fe Railroad Company pro
duced, about 60,000 barrels frcm its wells
seven miles from Fullerston last year,
and it is producing at a greater rate
now. All its oil is used for fuel in its
engines. As is well known by far the
greater part of the oil produced ls con
sumed as fuel in its crude state, though
the production of lubricating oils and the
many by-jjroducts at the refineries is
quite extensive. A very small amount of
illuminating, oil is made by refining and
this is controlled by the Standard Oil
Company, which probably mixes it with
its Eastern oils,
"New fields will be developed in the fu
ture all along the coast range. The
places already discovered at which the
geological structure is such as to allow
the accumulation of oil in valuable quan
tities undoubtedly have their counterparts
elsewhere at points yet unknown, and as
an Immensely greater number of people
are taking an Interest in oil it is becom
ing a leading feature of the mining in
terests of the State. The rise in the price
of Iron has not seriously retarded devel
opment and will not do so. Beople kick
at the Increased cost of wells, but if a
man wants to put down a well he will
do so when he gets through kicking.
The chief value of the patient geological
work that Mr. Watts and a few others are
doing lies in the fact thaf it serves as a
guide to Intelligent -prospecting and de
velopment in new places. A large number
of wells are always being put down by
"practical", oil men, who take charge of
operations for some company such as
those being formed so numerously in the
San Joaquin Valley, with little regard to
the study of the geological conditions, and
with much scorn of "geological experts."
But a geological expert in oil-bearing
formations can. often tell a driller that a
paying yield is impossible where he pro
poses to drill near an oil spring, and that
there are chances of success at points far
away where there are no signs of oil.
Not long ago a well nearly 2000 feet deep
was sunk in a near by county close to oil
indications, but it was on the wrong side
of the inclined oil-bearing formation, and
the deeper it went the further from oil
sand it got. Regarding the Importance of
scientific information in prospecting for
oil, Mr. Watts said:
"In California the structural conditions
affecting the lines along which paying
wells can be obtained are much more
complex than in the Eastern oil fields.
Hence it requires more geological knowl
edge to direct prospecting and the open
ing of new fields. Those who contemplate
investing in oil propositions should ac
quaint themselves with the facts con
cerning the occurrence of petroleum, so
that they may be able to form some esti
mate of the risks 'they are taking. Repo
sitions vary greatly In evident risk. There
is a lack of general knowledge as to what
constitutes a bona fide oil proposition, but
people are paying more attention now to
geological features and to technical meth
ods. I don't believe in luck. If a man is
going to put down a prospect well the
more he knows about the geological condi
tions the less the chances he takes. The
man who works out the geological facts
pertaining to territory to be prospected
is not infallible, hut he can say that on
account of such-and-such geological con
ditions there is or is not a reasonable
probability of obtaining oil in paying
quantities within such-and-such lmits.
Nature's secrets may be guessed at, and
the guess may be right; but the only re
liable method is to patiently work out the
problem. The only way to get a definite
knowledge of the facts pertaining to the
occurrence of petroleum ln California is
to systematically investigate the terri
tories in which there has been the most
development. These facts can then be ap
plied intelligently to territories yet unde
veloped." 'yf- 'â  'â  "-â¢â ''-"â â  .' . ,"â¢'_; ''^y_ ly
Mr. Watts ln his long study of the
Southern fields has several times pointed
out probabilities of success in untouched
fields One case was that of the eastern
extension of the Los Angeles field recently
developed successfully after his opinion
had been given. He pointed out the prob
ability of productive wells under the
ocean off the shore at Summerland,
where long wharves bear many oil der
ricks pumping oil from under the ocean.
But the man with the divining rod still
flourishes and Is busy all over the State
telling with his forked stick just where
to 'drill to get so many barrels of oil a
day. Mr. Watts runs â  across him fre
quently In Southern California, where he
always claims the discovery of a new field
and he is helping capital to operate in the
San Joaquin Valley. Other wells are
driven near oil indications according to
the advice of an experienced "practical"
man, who sizes up the ground with con
scious wisdom. His drill may strike an
oil supply and will if the oil is there and
the drill goes deep enough, but expert
scientific opinions are as needful in oil
enterprises as in any part of the mining
field and should be sought when several
thousand dollars is to be gambled on a
hole in the ground.
Mr. Watt s report will be .the third by
him on the oil and gas yielding formations
of California. This, with an extensive
work on the genesis of California petro
leum by State Mineralogist Cooper, and
the scientific work being done in the San
Joaquin by Deputy J. H. Means,' will af
ford this year extensive additions to the
scientific literature of oil and asphalt in
this State.
There is a probability that the Califor
nia Miners' Association will. Interest
Itself in the injunction suits against the
Kate Hayes and Red Dog, hydraulic mines
brought by the Anti-Debris Association
through its manager and attorney,. Robert
T. Devlin. These suits are based- on the
contention that the dams which have been
built at these mines to restrain the debris
of the hydraulic operations, .which have
been licensed by the Federal engineers
composing the California Debris Commis
sion and by them regularly inspected and
approved, are not built so as to efficiently
and - permanently restrain the tailings,
and so the streams below are being dam
aged and threatened. The Caminettl
law-placed the control of hydraulic min
ing operations In the watersheds of the
navigable streams of this State wholly
within the power and discretion of these
Federal engineers-, whose judgment alone
regulates the material â  and construction
of these private dams. They are sup
posed to be competent judges of what an
efficient dam is. but their competency in
this respect is now attacked.
The constitutionality of the Caminetti
law reposing final authority in the Fed
eral engineers is involved. It is asserted
that an appeal may be taken to the
courts, which may overrule the engineers.
The law Is assailed in its most vital part.
It is because the very existence of the
law is threatened that there is. a strong
sentiment among leading members of the
association In favor of taking up the flght.
Things are being rushed at the Melones
mine, In Calaveras. County, where the big
gest and finest stamp mill In California
-125 stampsâ is being erected by the new
company under the direction of Manager
W. 'C. Ralston and Superintendent T. B.
Deleray. Extensive buildings and costly
tunnel and other development operations
are ln preparation, and in less than a year
thÂ« ble-crest mill and the most notable low
grade quartz mine in the State will be in
operation. About $600,000 is being invested
in this long idle property, chiefly by East
ern capitalists, (whose co-operation was se
cured not long! ago by Mr. Ralston. This
is a typical example of what the rational
investment of capital in large mining en
terprises means to the prosperity of the
State. One result of this particular Inflow
of capital has been a boom for the little
town of Robinsons Ferry. This is what,
one new mine is doing for one nncrw r town,
acording to the Mountain Echo, published
at Angels Camp:
"We visited the thriving and rapidly
growing town of Robinsons Ferry last
Friday, and were agreeably surprised to
note the wonderful changes for good that
have been wrought there within the past
year. Over forty new buildings outside of
the mining company's structures
have been erected, and there are now
fully ten new buildings in course of con
struction. Several very fine cottages have
been built and also several large business
houses. Tents dot the hills and slopes
here and there, most of the occupants
waiting for material with which to con
struct houses. Business seems to be
thriving in all branches, and there are
fully 400 laboring men in the place, many
at work and many waiting for orders to
begin work." â  _
The benefits flowing from the develop
ment of the old Melones mine are not con
fined to Robinsons Ferry. The money in
vested and the constant stream of it to
go forth in expenses of operation through
the years will reach in some degree thou
sands of people and many interests, and
the successful working of such a great
body of low-grade ore will be a powerful
stimulus to other similar mining enter
prises in the State in the future.
The Bully Hill group of four copper
cialms near Copper City, In Shasta Coun
ty, have not yet been sold to Millionaire
Delamar for $350,000, as reported a day or
two ago. The owner, James M. Sallee of
San Francisco, returned here on Satur
day with Captain Delamar's representa
tive, Mr. Hartwig. but the deal has not
been closed, though it likely will be. This
is the most important mining deal pend
ing in the State just now and if effected
will be one of the most important of re
cent years. It would mean copper mining
operations and the erection of a smelter,
on something like the scale of the Moun
tain Copper Company at Iron Mountain
and Keswick, and it would mean the de
velopment of a large and rich copper belt
and further enterprises. A year ago the
property, on which considerable develop
ment work has been done, was bonded for
$275,000 to L A. Scowden and others, who
failed to float the proposition in the East
and in London before the bond expired
on July 1. Mr. Sallee raised his price
$75,000, but Captain Delamar is figuring on
the proposition while Redding hopes and
prays.
The projected Southern California Min
ers' Association, to be a rival to the re

NEWS OF FOBEIGN NAVIES.
The Japanese battleship building at
Vlckers, at Barrows, has been named Mi
kasa. and the armored cruiser building, at
Elswick the Iwaka.
The naval policy of Japan, according to
the London Engineer, is crystallized un
der flve heads: Firstly, battleships very
powerful; second, ships very swift and
suitable for most purposes; third, second
class cruisers for commerce duties;
fourth, third-class cruisers for scouting,
etc.; fifth, destroyers.
A dock basin is being built at Ham
burg which will cost $5,150,000. This, with
the floating dock recently completed, gives
the German navy practically an addition
al fitting out and repair station. The float
ing dock is 558 feet in length, 84 feet wide
and will take in a vessel drawing 29 feet.
In the event of war this dock can be
towed to Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the
Elbe, and war vessels can then be docked
and overhauled there. instead of going to
either Wllhelmshafen or Kiel for that
purpose.
The Foudre, torpedo transport ship in
the French navy, built in 1595, is being
converted into a seagoing training ship,
not having proved a success for the pur
pose originally intended. The vessel was
built to follow the British plan of having
a torpedo depot ship for the storage and
repairs of torpedoes to accompany a fleet
and distribute these missiles as required.
Her speed, however, fell short, and on
account of her narrow beam the ship did
not have the steadiness necessary for a
vessel of that class. Her prototype in
the British navy, the Vulcan, of 6620 tons,
built in 1889 at a cost of $1,852,235, has a
speed of 20 knots, whereas the Foudre, of
only 6090 tons, cost $2,038,560, and steama
about 19 knots. '
The Bulwark, battleship of 15,000 tons,
building at Devonport dockyard, was be
gun March 20 last, and up to June 20 3100
tons of material had been worked Into the
hull. This beats the best record of ship
building in any British | dockyard, and
Devonport holds the credit for fast and
economical work. As an offset to this
phenomenally quick work, the case of the
Gladiator'; a cruiser of 5800 tons, built at
the Portsmouth dockyard, is to be noted.
This ship was laid down in January, 1896,
and was not completed for passing into
the flrst reserve until June 20 last, thus
taking about three years and six months
in its construction, or nearly twice as long
as the building of the battleship Majestic,
of 14,900 tons, also built at the Portsmouth
dockyard in 1895.
The Japanese torpedo boat destroyer
Akebone, built by Yarrow, appears to be
the fastest of the six boats built by that
firm, and is reported to have made thirty
one knots. The vessel is 220 feet In length.
20*4 feet beam and 360 tons displacement.
The hull is of galvanized steel with a
small proportion of nickel, and has a ten
sile strength of forty tons to the square
inch. This material is very expensive and
has been used in only this Instance. The
Akebone's twin screw engines are triple
expansion, with four cylinders to each of
20Va, 31% and two of 34 inches diameter,
and a stroke of 18 inches. Steam is gen
erated in four "straight tube" Yarrow
boilers carrying 230 pounds. Each boiler
weighs eighteen tons with its water, and
will give 1600 horse power, or 6400 collect
ively. The vessel will stow 100 tons of
coal, and the armament, besides two
eighteen-inch torpedo tubes, consists of
one twelve-pounder and flve six-pounder
rapid firing guns. Her complement is
fifty-six officers and crew.
Mr. Lanesan, who succeeds Mr. Lockroy
as Minister of Marine in France, was
born in 1843 and was a surgeon in the navy
until IS7O, when he resigned and followed
his profession in private life. He eventu
ally drifted Into politics and has been
elected a Deputy several times. Mr.
Lockroy served in the last Cabinet less
than one year, but had been Minister of
Marine for a brief period in 1895-96. Tho
frequent changes in the French Ministry
of late years have been greatly detri
mental to the navy. Mr. Lanesan is tho
sixth change in the head of the naval ad
ministration since 1890, the successive
Ministers being: March, 1890, Admiral
Barbey succeeded by Admiral Lefevre in
December, 1893, until October, 1895, when
Mr. Lockroy came In and remained until
May, 1896, when Admiral Besnard took
oflice and was again supplanted by Mr.
Lockroy ln October, 1898, who held the
office about eight months. Each one of
these Ministers has had his hobby,
one believing entirely in large armored
ships, another in cruisers and armored
vessels of moderate size, and lastly Mr.
Lockroy, who pinned his faith on sub
marine boats. Various and radical reform
atory measures were introduced by each
Minister regarding the personnel and the
education of officers and no time wa*
given to prove the value or defects of such
measures before a new Minister took of
fice. As a natural result the navy has
always been in an unsettled condition and
Its expenditures have been heavy with
out rendering satisfactory results.

the Ith inst., but so far she has not been j
quarantined.
In any event the quarantine station at â¢
Angel Island is ready for all three ves
sels should they come in flying the yellow
flag. Yesterday an extra boiler and tank
for fumigating purposes and a large sup

fog early yesterday morning. She was
coming in from Australia and Captain
Jones was feeling his way along with
the lead when the fog signals on the reef
gave, him warning. It was so thick that !
he did not know which way to turn, so
he anchored his vessel. When the fog
lifted a little the wind had died down and
the Carrollton could not get away from ;
the reef, owing to the close quarters. The ;
steamer Pomona from Eureka was pass
ing, so Captain Jones signaled her and
when she came alongside he asked Cap
tain Parsons to send him a tug. Soon j
after the Pomona docked Captain Par

SERMONS ON THE
FALL OF THE BASTILE
The one hundred and tenth anniversary I
of the fall of the Bastile, which occurred !
July 14th, supplied the topic for two. very '
Interesting sermons last night.
Rev. E. R. Icelander at the First Eng- '
lish Lutheran Church addressed a large
audience. He said in part:
"The fall of the Bastile Impressed on
Fran*-*- forever a lesson in human rights.
The 14th of July was a great leveling day.
The echoes of the Declaration of Inde
pendence had gone across the sea. Over
in Scotland Robert Burns was singing o-'
the dignity of man.
"The outcome of this great popular up
heaval was ultimately to be an open Bi
ble. Th*- corollary of the French revolu
tion is the French public, in which tne
right of every man to search the Scrip
tures for himself is fully recognized. The
fall of th.- Bastile was an effective blow
for the enfranchisement of the individual
conscience."
At the First Congregational Church
Rev. I Jr. Adams spoke on the same topic.
He said:
"The fall of the Bastile is an event in
history which grows more and more sig
nificant as the years go by. One hundred
and ten years ago day before yesterday
a mob in- Paris, hungry, thirsting for ;
blood, demanded arms. Procuring mus- I
kets finally, they gathered at 1 o'clock in i
front of the Bastile. They wanted artil
lery, but the small garrison surrendered
on a promise of protection of an officer In
the mob. However, most of them were
struck down and killed. Such an episode
as this Is herd to understand without
study.
"That uprising and the events which fol
lowed have the sanction of the people to
day. It has been the making of the
French.
"Voltaire played a large part in the rev
olution. He fired the heart of the common
people of France. Carlyle gives us the
key to the meaning of the strange and
terrible scenes of the revolution when ne
says: 'Xo lie can permanently be.' "

LAUNCHING THE MODERN SCHOONER, JAMES ROLPH.
THE James Rolph is the latest and handsomest addition to the sugar fleet. She sails to-day for
Port Blakeley to load lumber for San Pedro, making three trips, and will then go into the sugar trade,
for which she was built.
It is doubtful whether there will be vessels enough to handle next year's sugar crop. About a dozen
new boats have been launched and nearly the same number are under way, but as it is estimated that there
will be 400,000 tons of sugar to move they will not relieve the situation a great deal. The James Rolph will
do her best to help out matters, however. She is 169 feet 1 inch long, 37 feet 9 inches beam,
and 12 feet 8 inches draft. James Rolph Jr. of the firm of Hind, Rolph &Co. is the managing owner and the
vessel is named after his father. She was launched from Bendixsen's yards in Eureka and christened by
Miss Anna M. Reid. The James Rolph will be commanded by Captain F. A. Bedrick.

â¦
Yesterday was the day of the feast of
Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The occa
sion was appropriately observed in all the
Catholic churches of the city. It was also
the anniversary of an Interesting- histor
ical event in the Catholic world. Just 130
years ago Father Junlpero Serra founded
the Mission -of Mount Carmel at Mon
terey, the first mission established In
Northern California.
At St. Ignatius Church Father Bell de
livered the morning' sermon. He took for
his text: "In me is the grace of the way
and of the truth; in me is all hope of life
and of virtue": Eccles. xxiv. He said in
part:
I apply my text to the Blessed Virgin, whom
the church calls the seat of wisdom. The
fathers and theologians all bear testimony
that in her is all grace; that although Christ
is the truth and the life, still he has consti
tuted the Blessed Virgin the dispenser of all
graces and, therefore, through her, come all
these \o men.
Since ln her 1? all grace of the way, then
it Is not surprising that since her glorious
triumph Into heaven there should be estab
lish. in the church so many devotions through
which men are led up to God. â¢
Among these devotions that of the Scapula
holds the highest place In its promises. It
secures for those who follow it a certain and
a happy eternity.
Father Fehran, who is here temporarily
from Canada, preached the evening ser
mon. . _
The forty hours devotion was opened
in old St. Mary's Church yesterday by
Father Younan, who preached in the

charmed during
the past four days
at the. California
Theater by the Ju
noesque beauty of
Mary Van Buren
of the Frawley
Company would
believe that within
her snowy breast
beats a heart
whose every pulsa
tion Is an echo of
sorrow? Who
could believe that
the same enchant-
Erery pulsa
in echo of
)Ileve that
B enchant
rso nallty
that has caused so
much eulogistic
comment is the
cause of all the
trouble? Jione.
Yet such is the
lamentable fact.
Mary Van Buren
weeps that she ls
as she is, and
hat's twenty
pounds too 'much.
"Would you be
eve it?" said the
actress, ' i weigh
one hundred and
sixty-five pounds.
Mr. Frawley tells
me I am too large
to be a young girl,
and I can neither
grow old in a min
ute nor come down
in weight. He says
I should not _ tip
he scales more
than one hundred and forty-five. Now I do weigh twenty pounds more than
that, but you would not think lt to 100k 1 at me, would you?"
Her visitor, emulating the example 'of his Royal Highness of Wales, side
stepped in. a gentleman and. said he would not.
"Marlon Mould," continued the tearful beauty, "is in as sore straits as
I am myself, but her trouble is at; the other end of it. She can't take, on
flesh, while I can't lose it. That's why I. worry myself nearly to death fear
ing the stage manager will have to make all the scenes with double doors
for my special benefit.
"Jim Jeffries, BO they tell me, when getting- in trim does away entirely
with water as a beverage. I am going to do the same thing. From this
hour on I will not touch another drop. I am going to get a bag and a set
of boxing gloves and"â with a smile of conscious powerâ "l'll soorj, be a
person whom the critics will not care to handle too roughly."
Miss Van Buren is a direct descendant of the President of that - name
on her mother's slue. . In private life her name is Mary Van Buren Haynes.
Her father was a captain in the regular army and a nephew of, General

morning on the subject of "Adoration."
He said in brief: .- X-
We adore Christ flrst of all, by faith. Take.
for Instance, the sublime confession of St.
Peter to the divinity of our Savior. Although
flesh and blood did not reveal the Godhead, yet
St. Peter, by the light received from the Father,
proclaimed the Savior, God and raan.7'.7>7
The advent, also, of the three wise men to
the rough cradle of the- King, bearing gold,
frankincense and myrrh, prostrating them
; selves before the Infant King, taught us the
lesson of adorationâ the faith that will lead
j Us, the ugh we cannot understand.
Father Caraher delivered an Interesting
' sermon yesterday morning to a large con
gregation at the Church of St. Francis.
He spoke of "Mount Carmel and its asso-
I ciations." He said in part:
The Catholic churches throughout the worK
; honor the Blessed Virgin to-day under the
; singular title of "Our Lady of Mount Carmel."
She received this title because she was pre
i figured by that small cloud resembling a man's
, foot, which the prophet Ellas beheld from
Mount Carmel arising out of the Mediterranean
Sea, and because she was venerated from the
very earliest ages of Christianity by hermits,
Who dwelt in caves upon the mount.
To-day's feast has more than an ordinary
Interest for the Inhabitants of California, be
-1 cause it was in the month of July about 130
years age that Carmelo Bay was discovered
by the zealous and saintly missionary, Junl
pero Serra.
Father Caraher In his discourse told of
many interesting features of Mount Car
mel, which he once visited.
} Rev. Father Henry, superior of the Holy
i Rosary Church of Portland, spoke yester
: day morning at St. Dominic's Church.
! Father Newell, prior of the monastery,

"Warren of this brotherhood returned from

j past two years.

For some months to come Archbishop

curred the displeasure of Amos Adams,
the "watchman" at the notorious Hotel
Nymphla, on Pacific street, yesterday
afternoon, and the latter struck him a
vicious blow on the head with a police
man's club, cutting a deep gash which re
quired the attention of the surgeon, at the
Harbor Hospital. Adams was arrested
and booked at the California-street sta

Colonel Summers Thinks It Would
Be a Great Imposition to Re
quire the Soldiers to Buy
Thicker Clothing.
â  â â  â
One was reminded yesterday at the Pre
sidio of the days before the First Califor- i
nia left for the Philippines. Great crowds
of curious people were out to have a look
at the returned heroes, and the camp of
the Second Oregon Regiment, which Is
where stood that of the First California,
was taxed to its utmost capacity to ac
commodate the surging mass of humanity
that poured in one continuous stream
through the company streets during, the
afternoon. Colonel Summers was kept
busy receiving the ceaseless stream of
visitors that called at headquarters and j
thanking them for their expressions of I
good-will. One object of admiration in
the colonel's tent was a small monkey
that he is taking home to his boy. The
monkey in question is quite tame and af
fectionate. The colonel declares that he
is every inch a soldier.
In discussing the matter of the muster
ing out of the regiment Colonel Summers
said: "We will begin the work of getting
the papers ready to-morrow. This will
I presume, require about three weeks As
I advised the regiment will be paid en
route to Oregon. This will give the men
some spending money when they arrive
at home, or at least enough for them to
take care of themselves for a while. They
will nearly all be met by their families or
friends, so that none of them will be in
actual want. The regiment received two
months' pay on Saturday, .so that for the
present they are provided with money to
meet their actual wants. While we are
in oamp here I shall allow the men every
possible liberty, and all that will be re
quired of them will be to report at night I
The regiment will be drilled just enough
to keep it in condition, and this, with reg
ular guard duty, will be all that the met!
will be required to do in the way of duty
"The matter of the clothing that we
have at present is causing m* some worry.
As I have said, we have such a short
while to stay in San Francisco, It does not
seem fair to ask the men to expend their
money to buy thicker clothing. I have
seen no bad effects as yet from the fact
that the men have only the thin kharki
they wore in Manila. If they were to be
ordered to get the heavier clothing they
would have to pay for it. which would be
an unnecessary expense to put the men to
for so short a stay in San Francisco."
FIGHTING JOE WHEELER.
The Famous Southern Warrior Re
ceives Much Flattering Attention.
General Wheeler passed a quiet day yes
terday, resting after the excitement and
fatigue that attended his long trip across
tho continent, which was practically an
ovation from the start.
Arising at 8 o'clock, he breakfasted with
his daughter, after which he took a car
and rode to the Presidio to call on Gen
eral Shafter. That gentleman was not at
home, so the famous Southern lighter
went to Golden Gate Park and passed the
rest of the morning visiting the -various
places of Interest therein and admiring
the beauty of the gardens, hothouses and
driveways. After lunch he received a
large number of callers, among whom
were many who had fought under him
when gray .Â» not blue, was his uniform, and |
who were delighted to see. him once more j
and talk over the incidents of a third of a j
century ago.
The evening was spent in returning calls
and being entertained by those, who de
sired to honor the chivalry of the South in
the person of its most famous living com
mander. ' '

DR. GIBSON SPEAKS OF
ABSALOM THE HANDSOME
Rev. J. George Gibson spoke at Em
manuel Baptist Church last night on
"Absalom the Handsome." He said in
part:
"Absalom was unfortunate in his father
and in his home. His father was impure
and his home was a hotbed of suspicion,
intrigue and incest. If a father is im
pure his boys will find it out.
"Absalom was handsome. This was one
of his dangers. Among wicked â¢people
neither beautiful women nor handsome
men are safe. Wickedness loves to mar
beauty. Sin looks at the perfect statue
only to crack it. Vice selects the fairest
picture to scratch it. Sin loves ruins and
does not even cover them with ivy to
hide their shame. If a man â¢Is hand
some and good he is a hero."
SHOT BY A WOMAN.
Mrs. Mack Fires a Bullet Into Neil
Bonner's Hand.
Lizzie Mack, who resides on Illinois
street, near the Arctic Oil Works, was
arrested last night and charged with as
sault to commit murder for having shot
Nell Bonner in the left hand earlier In i
the evening. Bonner was also arrested
and charged with battery, the woman
claiming that he struck her before she
crippled him with a bullet. ~fl_FÃ_S
The woman's husband is away in the
country, and Bonner, according to the
police, has been a visitor at her house.
ACTOR HAVES A SICK MAN.
Popular Comedian Suffering From
Congestion of the Lungs.
- Hayes and Lytton's farce comedy
sketch, "A Wise Guy," in which they
have made such a hit at the Orpheum
during the past few weeks, did not con
tribute last night to the amusement of
the audience at that popular playhouse.
The reason was contained in an an
nouncement from Â«the stage that Mr.
Hayes was ferlng from congestion of
the lungs and was confined to his room in
the Imperial Hotel. While Mr. Hayes" il
ness is not considered serious,,- he is a
very sick man and his physicians insist
that absolute rest is necessary to insure
his prompt recovery.

J, One year ago last June three doc-

Compound with good results, I had too
much faith in it to die until I had tried
it again. I was apparently an invalid,
was confined to my bed for ten weeks.

womb).

Compound and using some of the LivÂ»r

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 10, Oakland 8.
The Beau Brummels of Oakland and the
â¢statesmen of the capital had two distinct
diamond engagements yesterday, In the
' morning at Oakland and in the afternoon
', at Recreation Park, this city.
The morning mix-up was just the kind
I- that suited Oakland. In the very first
1 inning it scored twice, and repeated for
j five more runs in the second.
Sacramento said nothing, finding Mos
-1 kiman with a steady and painful ease. At
: the end of the seventh inning the score
i was tied. During the eighth it remained
unchanged and both teams steadied down
I to careful and accurate playing.. Then the
< Senators started to rap the ball all over
the grounds. McLaughlin began the race
around the bags with a double; Harvey
went to first merely because Hutchinson
' did not care to exert himself after he
stopped a hot grounder; Doyle followed
with a base on balls, filling the three rest
ing places. Then up walked Eagan, the
. beef embalmer. for a double to far center,
' and McLaughlin and Harvey scored. Stan
ley tried punching the heavens with a
sky-scraper, but it perished In Dunleavy'a
fists. Doyle on third beat the ball in.
The score read 10-7 in favor of the
Statesmen when the Dudes came to bat
for the last time. By a series of hard
smashes Donovan was forced over the
plate. With Peeples. Hammond and Har
l die on the bags, Dunleavy took up the
Mick. He caught the ball on the nose,
j but it went sailing Into Texas Mike's
palms and the game was over. The score:

AFTERNOON GAME.
Sacramento 6, Oakland 1.
Eight innings of rattling play marked
the afternoon game. At the end of the
seventh the score read Ito 1. Errors were
very few.
It was in the first inning that Shanahan
of the salmon country went jogging to
first on a single. Stultz furthered his
travels by another, and these two _ were
i each advanced a station on Sheehan's
sacrifice bunt. McLaughlin went to bat
and let drive for a single right In the
safest spot of center field. Shanahan
crossed the plate, but Stultz, who was
close upon his heels, was caught at the
haven and died.
Oakland's only run was made in tho
> fifth. Lange smashed the ball out for
; two bags and went to third when Schmeer
rapped a single Donovan attempted to
bunt, but died a quick and unnatural
death. Steffanl walked up to the plate
' with a jaunty air that promised much.
!He swung and Lange scored. Nothing
more In the way of run-making for Oaâ
land was effected.
In the seventh inning Stultz started after
a ball from Moskiman's bat and it was
a cinch that he wouldn't "et it. With a
flying leap backward he shot out his left
and the ball stuck. It was the prettiest
individual work of the day.
The eighth inning was fruitful of an
other run for the Senators. McLaughlin
crossed the plate this time. The last in
ning was a noisy, turbulent revelry .n
runs for one sine, the Senators. Shana
han, Stultz. McLaughlin and Harvey
worked around the bases with hits, bases
on balls and an occasional error.
Harvey for the Senators pitched a great
game and was well supported by nis team.
The hits off Steffanl were bunched and
in the last inning resulted in a string of
; runs. The score: 7. :

RIFLEMEN AND PICNICKERS
AT SCHUETZEN PARK
SHARPSHOOTERS* rifles cracked merrily yesterday
at Schuetzen Park, the whir of bullets mingling
with the sounds of music that came floating over
from the big pavilion, where a hundred couples
danced. The California Schuetzen Club was holding
its monthly bullseye shoot, and the Grutli Shooting
Section and the San Francisco Turner Schuetzen were each
doing likewise, while scattered through the grounds, in
the bowling alleys and in the dance hall were the "Forty
niners" of the San Francisco Parlor, N. S. G. W., enjoying
their annual picnic. There were just enough of the lat
ter present to make things lively, and the ' brass band
which was in attendance was given little opportunity to
rest until the signal was sounded for the last train back
to the city.
The picnickers had the grounds to themselves, as the
marksmen were too busy peppering the bullseye targets
to think even of leaving the rifle range. It was a good day
for shooting, too. There was scarcely any wind and thy
light was perfect. Good scores were the rule, the honors
of the day going to C. J. Walden, who made the best
score in the California Schuetzen Club contest. Walden
also headed the list of cracks at the last monthly shoot,
and while his score yesterday was not quite as good as
that of a month ago it was, nevertheless, good enough to
keep him in the lead. The scores for the day were as fol
lows:
California Schuetzen Club monthly bullseye shootâ C.
son was that of the San Jose and Santa
Cruz teams to-day.
The Lobsters fell beneath the pruning
knives of the Fruit Pickers after a severe
and hard-fought struggle. The score
was 2 to 0.
Not a run was made after the first in
-1 ning. McGueken and Anderson crossed
the plate for San Jose the first chance
they had. San Jose played an errorless
game, while only two errors were made
by Santa Cruz. Both Daubenbls and An
drews pitched great ball.
One of San Jose's runs was made
through Williams' Juggle of a ball thrown
by Catcher Pace. Twice Santa Cruz had
the bases full with only one man out and
failed to score. The score:

out for having missed first by a few
inches. Dad Harper was in great form.
The Wasps made several pretty double
plays but the infield work of Krug and
Riley was somewhat ragged. Josh Riley

SAGAR'S SLOOP CAPTURES THE
WALLACE TROPHY.
Winner's Victory Due to Her Excel
lent Work in Beating- Out to
Windward.
The California Yacht Club members held
their annual race for the Wallace trophy
yesterday over the usual course from the
southerly pier-head of the narrow-gauge
mole at Oakland out to Presidio Shoal
buoy. The first or preparatory gun was
fired at 12:35 p. m., and the starting gun
for classes 1 and 2 at 12:45 p. m.; but none
of the yachts in those classes started.
Vice Commodore A. C. Lee's sloop Sur
prise was cruising about with a reef in
her mainsail, but her owner, finding that
she had no competitors in her own class,
did not cross the starting line.
At 1 o'clock the gun signaling the
yachts- of class 3to start boomed out. The
yawl Idler and the sloops Edna, Embla
and Pactolus were all near the line, and
crossed in a bunch, the Embla first, Idler
next, Pactolus third and Edna last. From
the start the Edna outpointed and out
footed her rivals. The Edna. Embla and
Idler kept over toward Goat Island, but
Commodore Clay went . nearer to tne
water front. The Edna kept increasing
her lead until at Presidio Shoal buoy she
was 37 minutes ahead of the Embla and
45 minutes ahead of the Pactolus. On the
run home, with spinnakers and watersails
set, the Edna lost 41 seconds of her lead
over the Pactolus, finishing 36 minutes
and 30 seconds ahead of the Embla, and 44
minutes atid 19 seconds ahead of the Pac
tolus. The yawl Idler started and fin
ished a few seconds behind the Embla,
but as she did not round the buoy the
course was not completed by her.
On the run home the Edna lost 30 sec
onds of the lead she had established over
the Embla on the beat out. The Edna's
windward work was excellent; she was
well handled, and had an efficient crew,
which included Cormodore Carl Wester
feld, J. Short, Frank Thompson and E.
Schober. ' In Commodore Clay's crew
were R. L. Eames. R. R. l'Hommedieu
and Captain Llghtfoot of the Healanl
Yacht Club of Honolulu. E. F. Sagar has
won the Wallace trophy two years in suc
cession. Last year he defeated his only
competitor, E. N. Walter's sloop Embla,
by more than 12 minutes. Her victory yes
terday was so decisive that no calculation
of time allowance was made.

Attacks on the American Team
Deplored by the Athletes of

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BRIGHTON, England, July 16.â The
joint commission having charge of the
forthcoming athletic contests between the
teams of Yale and Harvard and. Oxford
and Cambridge Universities at the
Queen's Club, West Kensington, London,
held its first official meeting at the Hotel
Metropoie this afternoon. The English
men came from Eastbourne and took
lunch with the Americans. Evart Wen
dell of Harvard presided and among those
present were Joseph B. Morrison, Charles ;
H. Sherrill and Holcomb J. Browne on
behalf of the Americans and C. N. Jack
son, T. C. VaÃsall and A. Hunter on be
half of the home team.
The meeting proved most satisfactory,
the greatest good feeling being displayed
on both sides. The status of Burke and j
Quintan of the American team was
roughly discussed and the conclusion ar
rived at was that no objection to them
would hold for a moment.
Mr. Jackson was very emphatic in de
nouncing the English newspapers that
originated the controversy. He asked
that it be made plain to the American
newspapers that neither he nor his col
leagues would under any circumstances
have considered any objection to either
Quinian or Burke.
"The fact that these gentlemen, Mr.
Wendell and his fellow committeemen,
who are of such high standing in ama- j
teur athletics, vouch for them is entirely
sufficient," said Mr. Jackson, "and if any j
objection should be raised again to either I
it will not proceed from the Oxford-Cam
bridge officials, and will not have the
sympathy of Oxford or Cambridge men."
The main object of to-day's meeting was
to harmonize the Anglo-American Ama
teur Athletic rules, which vary in some
minor particulars. In order that the con
tests may be carried out under conditions
that shall be indisputable it was agreed
that the hurdle races should be run un
der American conditions, over loose in
stead of fixed hurdles, and that each side
should follow its own custom in hammer
throwing. It was also agreed that the
high jump should be taken from the turf
in the center of the grounds instead of
the cinder path. Some minor details with
regard to the long jump were adjusted.
The order of events has yet to be ar
ranged. On the American side there has !
been no definite choice of the actual com- i
petitors for the 100-yard and hurdle j
races. It is possible that in these cases
alternate names may appear on the pro
gramme.
The sports will begin punctually at 4
o'clock in the afternoon, as the Prince of
Wales will be oblÂ»ged to leave at 5 o'clock
for ids yacht in the Solent.
The committee will meet again at the
Queen's Club next Tuesday to complete
the final arrangements.
The American team did not practice to
day. The men went to church in a body
this morning, and went for a drive tnis
afternoon. To-morrow they will leave for
London, and will take their further"prac
tice at the Queen's Club.
KAISER "WILLIAM MAY
STEER THE METEOR
Rumor That He Will Participate in
the Trials of the
Shamrock.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, WW, by James Gor
don Bennett. â¢ .. .
SOUTHAMPTON, July 16.â A rumor
that is highly incredible but which is per
sistently repeated here and finds many
believers is that the Kaiser is going to
take a run over here and steer the Meteor
in its trial with the Shamrock. Public
opinion continues to favor the idea that
the trial should be with the Meteor rather
than with the Britannia, and Mr. Fife is
one of the advocates of the proposed
change.
According to the statement of one who
saw the Shamrock in the drydock, she
has a fln . keel, which is very deep, and
runs away forward and aft. In this sne
differs essentially from the Meteor, tiie
Britannia and the Columbia, whose plans
are published* and illustrated in this
week's Yachtsman with the comment that
this publication Is from the Scientific
American. This is a strong contrast to
the secrecy that has been observed in
everything that pertains to the challeng
ing yacht.
Mv informant further adds that the keel
of the Shamrock is so small that it was
held on three blocks only. As for the
hull, it is built on the skimming dish plan,
very shallow and extrornely broad. It
will thus be seen that Mr. Fife has used
his ingenuity to produce a boat which.
I should say, would be handy for reaching
or running.
This being Sunday there was no work
on board the Shamrock, but she had many
visitors all day long.
NEWPORT. R. 1., July 16.â The New
port Yacht Racing Association to-day
gave cut the following circular: - .
"The flrst race between the Columbia
and Defender off this port under the
auspices of this association will be held
on Friday, July 21. The start will be
made from Brentons lightship at 11 a. m.
and the course will be a triangular one,
but where the marks will be has not been
decided upon.
"The date of the second race will be
announced later. '-:â '-:.;.-i"
--"The committee finds it will be unable
to furnish accommodation for the press,
as the judges' boat will be a private
yacht placed at the disposal of the com
mittee."
WHIST CONGRESS ADJOURNS.
League "Long Suit" System Adopted
as the Standard.
CHICAGO, July 16.â The ninth annual
congress of the American Whist League
came to an end early this morning at the
Auditorium Hotel. The Hamilton Club
trophy arid the championship for teams
of four go to the Buffalo Whist Club; the
Chicago Duplicate Whist Club secures the
Minneapolis trophy and the championship
for club pairs, and the American Whist
League challenge trophy becomes the
prize of the St. Paul Club. These are tne
principal trophies for which the expert
whist players have contended during the
* â  ' . â  - â 
tournament, the East being pitted against
the West Â. â  â _i_
The contest for the. Minneapolis- trophy
was the last to be decided. So close was
the playing of the eight pairs entered in
the contest that a difference of only 3 Â»
points stood between the lowest score
and that .of the winners. Thirty-eight
pairs entered the preliminaries for the
Minneapolis trophy, this " umbe * being
reduced to eight before the commence
ment of the fifty-six hands' which settled
the disposition of the prize. â , v ââ_.,_. a
Aside from the championship struggles
the most important work of the congress
was the adoption of the league long suit
system of play as the standard for cham
pionship contests. The rule prohibiting
the playing of boards for money at ne
congress was reaffirmed. Action was also
taken recognizing women as eligible con
testants. Heretofore women players nave
been permitted to share in the contests
only as a matter of courtesy.

COLUMBIA MARKSMEN.
Good Scores Made by Several New
Members.
The regular shoot of the Columbia Pis
tol and Rifle Club took place yesterday
at Harbor View range. Early in the day
the weather was pleasant and, although
the fog came in thick late in the after
noon, it seemed to Improve the light and
was a benefit instead of a detriment to
the shooting". The attendance was good
and several of the new members made a
spurt in their work, which was highly
satisfactory to the club. All of the shoot
ing was on re-entry matches. The condi
tions were 90-shot scores on the Columbia

Oakland Office- Pan Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 16.
A glance at the conditions at the City
Hall suggests thai one more parlor meet
ing might be held with benefit to all con- i
cerned. The precedent has been estab
lished that parlor meetings are the proper
thing, and no one doubts thai l hey
possess a vast advantage over the meet- j
ings held by former administrations in I
the rear rooms of cigar stores and
.It has just developed that at one of
these little gatherings in Dr. Pardee's
library Mr. Miller was guaranteed two
years more ln office should he be defeated
"for City Engineer. It has also come to
light that at a more recent social gath
ering around Councilman Taylor's dining
room table - me more friendly politics
was discussed. Mr. Snow, in the first
blush of his mayoralty, exchanged some
sensible Ideas with the fellow members
of his administration in Ills parlor at the
Hotel Metropoie. Mr. Rowe is slated for
a similar friendly banquet, and it is .
Mated that the example is to run all along |
: the line, although lt is not expected that
Mr. Schaffer will invite Mr. Taylor or Mr.
Miller to his banquet for reasons that
:.eed not be repeated.
This method of meeting having been
established, lt would be only right to
hold one more, where all the little differ
ences of opinion that now exist and which
are being magnified by interested parties
could be adjusted on an intelligent basis
â without loss of dignity. Surely every
body Is now convinced of the folly of
members of one municipal family rush
ing into print to air their grievances
against each other, or airing. them before
lobbies and running the risk of being
* riticized for playing to the gallery.
It will not be amiss to glance briefly at
each individual member of the adminis
tration as he stands to-day in the public
eye after nearly four months on exhibi
tion. Mayor Snow has shown just that In
dependence of action and thought that
was expected of him. In no instance has
he allowed himself to be dictated to
against his better judgment. Because of
this method of conducting his offlce he
has often been criticized, and naturally
has made some political enemies. This
is the best proof that he is not a tool ln
ihe har.ds of any individual or clique.
Little men with axes to grind have never
Just an opportunity of trying to convince
the thousands who elected Mr. Snow that
they u.ade a mistake, but they have not
succeeded and the only indictment yet
"brought against the Mayor is that his !
memory fails to recall an alleged promise
made In tiie presence of Dr. Pardee and i
< it h<-r gentlemen prior to the last election. |
Instead of all the assertions and de
nials that have appeared in print the last !
,- two weeks regarding Mr. Miller and the j
many attempts to force the Mayor to I
act against his will, it would have been '
Jar more politic and immensely more dip
lomatic to have adjusted the misunder
standingâ for such it now confessedly Isâ :
at a little gathering where the Interested
critic was not ln attendance.
City Attorney Dow has followed close- i
ly, the lines which he laid down and which
were laid down for him during the cam
paign. No one has ever criticized Mr.
Low's ability or energy as a City Attor- .
ney. He has mixed in little tilts with ]
the Mayor, anu it is to be regretted that
both gentlemen have occasionally inter- ]
jected remarks into their public meetings j
â  which would have been better unsaid.
This, however, does not destroy their use- !
fulness or Impair the public standing of
the gentlemen. Instead of having to be
pestefed with petty patronage, Mr. Dow,
as City Attorney, should be removed from
Fuc-h annoyances, and In .view of the
time that has been consumed in dispos
ing of the water-front cases, I believe that
â¢ Mr.' Dow and his assistant could In all
"â¢ these years have handled the cases as
' ably as the special attorney who drew
nich princely sums from the City Treas
, ury, for work which, to the lay mind,
.appears to be as far as ever from an ul
timate conclusion.
City Engineer Clement Is unfortunate
â¢â  In being a Democrat among Republicans,
although lt is understood that originally
Â° he was a. Republican. He certainly was
elected the first time as a "young man
candidate," irrespective of politics, but
being taken up on the Democratic ticket
against an unpopular Republican, he was
landed In offlce. it cannot be forgotten,
. ..however, that he was, only four months
: ago, still a little more popular than the
Republican candidate. Owing to the sys
tem under which he is paid, it cannot.be
supposed that Republicans will go out of
their way to help increase his salary
when he declines to follow the lines of
â  fhe- Republican programmes. It is un
fortunate that he. like the City Attorney,
' is forced Into politics through the stu
j pidity of a charter which everybody con
demns but which no one appears to have
the courage to undertake to reform.
i --Â«ddcnt Row* has handled the Council
-. for four months with much executive abil
â 'â¢' ity, but he steps from the rostrum too
! frequently to take part In debates, when
â¢â¢" he would perhaps be better off If he con
tented himself with mer ly recording his
vote. His many little pleasant differences
' with Mr. CuvelUer have led some to be
lieve that each is anxious that the other
should not become too prominent. Of
â¢course this is only pleasantry, but pleas
antry cuts a big figure in politics.
Mr. Stetson has tried to carry out some
pood ideas regarding public improvements
if the committee of which he Is chair
man. He is too much in favor of discuss
ing and redlscussing small measures,
which delay and Interfere with the prog
ress of more important ones. His friend

NEWS
of the Bay Cities
Mr. Stetson is perhaps a little too con
scientious for an Oakland Councilman. In
this city there is too much business for
half a dozen committee and regular meet
ings to be spent In legislation over any
single saloon license.
Councilman Girard has now on hand a
scheme for sprinkling the streets with salt
water, ar.d his ideas are being ably sec
onded by Mr. CuvelUer. The figures on
the cost of fresh water for street sprink
ling so affected Mr. Girard that he is now
regaining his equanimity hunting bear
and indulging In other exciting recreation.
He Is one of the few men in the Council
whom no one credits with making a race
for Mayor.
Mr. Upton, Mr. Barstow and Mr. Moose
are three of the most thoughtful members
of the Council and come in the same cat
egory. Neither has any pet scheme or
hobby, but each gives cartful and ju
dicious attention to whatever matter is
before him. Neither is given much to
talking, but somehow or other everything
they say is remembered and carries
weight.
Mr. Mott does not care for anybody. He
apparently cares for nothing except to
see that "the business before the Council
it attended to thoroughly and with rea
sonable expedition. He is as far removed
from sentimentalism as the" county build
ings are politically from the City Hall.
But whether lt is a saloon license or the
purchase of historic guns. Mr. Mott gen
erally says something that carries con
viction, and wastes no words In saying it.
Mr. Schaffer has been a minority of one
almost since he took office. His political
associate, Mr. Kramra. has been prevent
ed by severe sickness from attending
Council meetings till just recently. But
he and Mr. Schaffer have let it be plainly
known that they have no desire to help
Mr Miller to be retained in office as Su
perintendent of Streets. Since Mr. Tay
lor neglected to invite Mr. Schaffer to his
banquet the two gentlemen have not, so
far as known, exchanged cigars.
Mr. CuvelUer has Just met with a great
; disappointment. He does not see any rea
â  son why Oaklanders should be compelled
to pay rates for water that will produce
, interest on an amount about three times
the value of a water plant that could
| supply this city. He has spent three
months procuring data on this subject
'â  and he should feel very well satisfied with
the report he has just prepared on the
subject, although it disposes permanently
of the pet scheme he hoped to see adopt
ed. He has made the discovery that there
ls politics even in water.
Felton Taylor is the attorney of the
board. As a rule he lets the other fel
lows do all the talking and then with
professional grace ho undertakes the
cross-examination of the witnesses. Al
though an old football player, he ls not
a kicker, and although new ln politics no
one Is playing him.
These are the fourteen men who com
pose the city government and whom 'the
outs" are interested ln keeping in a
fighting attitude, so that they shall be
discredited and prepare the way for some
i more "solid sixes" when they go out of
offlce. So far this scheme has met with
â¢ too much success, and the administration
has not fulfilled all that was expected of
j it. The couple of hundred politicians and
Interested parties who attend the meet
! Ings of the Board of Works and the City
Council, or who continually cross the path
| of city officials, are not the people by
I whom the city government was elected.
I It was elected by the thousands of peo
i ple who pay water rates, use crosswalks,
want good sewerÃ, appreciate good
streets, need proper police and fire pro
tection and all the other civic rights that
are to be found with good government.
These are the people who pay the taxes
that the city government expends, and it
Is these people who have the right to
demand the attention and services of the
city officials and to expect that they will
not fritter away valuable time pandering
to the petty schemes and selfish wishes
of a mere handful of politicians.
The annexed district, covering many
square miles, is crying out for sewers;
West Oakland has started a movement to
procure a wharf; Twenty-third avenue Is
anxious for a public park; West Oakland
wants its park improved; North Oakland
wants a park; Central .Oakland wants a
park; East Oakland wants Independent
square improved; the city's share of the
water front Is crying out for attention;
there is need of permanent improvement
on several highways; the City Hall prob
lem needs working out; the report of the
Fire 'and Water Committee relating to a
possible local supply of fresh water
should receive more attention than to be
"read and placed on fie." And there are
scores of ' other important measures de
manding the attention of the city govern
ment and to give attention to which it
was elected. Votes were not cast for the
successful ticket last March so that rela
tives of Councilmen might be given soft
positions in the city government, or that
any particular Individual might be placed
in a position where he can make a cam
paign to become Mayor or to go to Con
gress.
At this time It would be well for those
charged with the serious duty of govern
ing Oakland to take out the dusty plat
forms of the Republican and Municipal
League parties and read the practical
pledges which they were elected to carry
out and which they seem to have forgot,
not excepting the dollar limit tax.

90S Broadway, July 16.
"I am tired of being sick all the time, so
good-by, Mamma."
After writing these words hurriedly
upon a small scrap of paper and handing
it to her little brother to give to her
mother, Miss Tillie Steckmeyer, a pretty
blonde, aged IS years, lifted a cup of car
bolic acid to her lips, swallowed a portion
of the deadly poison, then, dashing the
cup to the floor, she rushed screaming
from her home at 221 Second street, to
night, and fell on tho front doorstep.
She was carried to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Steward Borchert and Dr. W.
K. Sanborn administered antidotes and
applied the stomach pump. Miss Steck
meyer*s lips, mouth and throat are badly
burned, but she has an even chance of
recovering unless complications from tno
corrosive action of the acid set in.
Miss Steckmeyer has been the house
keeper at Dr. Crawford's residence, cor
ner of West and Twelfth streets, for some
time. When she visited her mother to
night she complained that she had suf
fered from sick headaches so much of late
that she could stand it no longer. She
said that about three months ago she
had fallen from a second-story bay win
dow at Dr. Crawford's house, and that
though she had apparently sustained no
Injuries then she had suffered much since.
This is supposed to have prompted her
attempt at self-destruction.

MARKED THE ALPHABET
TO TELL HIS STORY
MYSTERY OF JACK STANTON'S
INJURY SOLVED.
Man With the Broken Skull Was
Struck by a
Train.
OAKLAND, July 16.â Dr. W. S. Porter
this afternoon solved the mystery of the
injury to "Jack" Stanton, who on last
Tuesday morning walked Into the Receiv
ing Hospital to be treated for a com
pound fracture of the skull. This prob
lem had puzzled the hospital and police
authorities to that extent that theories
without end were offered.
It was seriously, supposed that Stanton
had been the victim of a murderous as
sault. Stanton himself had been unable to
explain. The injury to his head and the
subsequent operation of removing shat
tered skull bone and a portion^ of the
brain matter had impaired the nerves con
trolling the power of speech, so that the
patient could not speak a word. Yet he
realized everything that went on about
him and remained perfectly conscious.
However, he was not strong enough to
make known with pencil and paper how
he met with the Injury.
When Dr. Porter yesterday removed the
bandages from Stanton'B : head he was
well pleased with the appearance of the
wound, for it practically proved the suc
cess of the original operation. To-day the
patient showed another marked improve
ment, and though still unable to utter or
write a word, Dr. Porter determined to
learn from him the secret of his Injury-
Taking an olw calendar. Dr. Por
ter printed with a lead pencil upon the
clean back of the card the alphabet In
clear characters. He then asked the pa
tient to take the pencil and mark those
Berkeley
letters that would spell the name or char
acter of what struck him.
Stanton eagerly took the card and pen
cil, running a scratch over the letters
"TRAIN."
"Aha! That's fine," responded the sur
geon. "Now what kind of a train was it
and what time?"
The patient then made known in the
same manner that a freight train at 3
o'clock Tuesday morning had struck him.
He had tried to board the train on First
street.
Before Dr. Porter withdrew with the
card and pencil Stanton had also made
known that as soon as he had regained
consciousness after being struck by the
train he had hurried to the hospital for
treatment. When informed that he' had
even chances of recovery the' patient
made a desperate effort to speak, but
without success.
Merchants Will Fight.
BERKELEY, July 16.â Much interest at
taches to the question as to whether the
license tax recently imposed by the Board
of Trustees upon the business men of this
city is legal or not. Four arrests of prom
inent business men have been made al
ready and their cases come up for hear
ing in Judge Edgar's court to-morrow
morning. The leading merchants and ex
pressmen have combined to fight the tax,
ami they have retained Attorney M. C.
Chapman of Oakland to conduct the cases
In their behalf. The men who will be ar
raigned to-morrow are Joseph Davis.
Charles Fischel. E. H. Driggs and E. J.
Gordon.- Tneir trial will form a test case
pending which no further arrests will be
made.
MEDAL FUND GROWING.

tributed to all soldiers and sailors enlist
ing in California in addition to the medals.

ignation owing to the pressure of other

Mayor Phelan's veto of the "coursing
order" will probably be sustained by the
Board of Supervisors and the anti-pool
polling- law as originally passed will be
allowed to stand. This, at least, was the
disposition of the majority of the Board
of Supervisors when they met last even
ing to discuss the numerous matters
which arc to come before them to-day.
Members and friends of the Ingleside
Coursing Association! which is directly
affected by the Mayor's message of dis
approval, have beset the members of in.
board since Mr. Phelan's decision was an
nounced yesterday morning, but the
board is disposed to let the matter rest
as it is.
'"Wo have had trouble enough over this
racing matter as it Is.' said a prominent
member of the majority last evening.
"They have threatened us with all sorts
of bodily harm ami political disaster, and
I think the board is quite willing to jet
the Mayor wrestle with the question him
self. There are fully five thousand peo
ple who are interested In coursing wno
are as mad a lot of Indians over ..Â»Â«
Mayor's action, and the problem may
prove Interesting yet. I think there Is
little danger that his veto will be over
ruled."
The police had been instructed to be on
hand and prevent either bookmaking or
pool selling at Ingleside yesterday, but !
there was no call for their services. line i
association abided by the veto and tne j
coursing was declared off. Just what .
steps the club will take next it has not
yet decided.

ANOTHER RICH STRIKE.
High Grade Ore Found in the Famous
Gwin Mine.
- A vein of high-grade ore has been en
countered in sinking the shaft of the !
Gwin mine at a depth of 1.770 feet perpen- |
dicular. Average samples of the vein
show a value of from $15 to $30 per ton.
It is an entirely new pay shoot, running
parallel with the main ore body on the
west. The finding of this unexpected par
allel vein means a great deal for deep
mining on the mother lode.
The ore is of the same character and
looks like that found on the 1800-foot level
of the Kennedy mine, which is the deep
est mine now working on the mother lode.
The extent of the rich ore encountered is
not yet known. No developments have
been made except what was taken out In <
the sinking of the shaft, but the finding of !
this ore body means a great deal for the i
future of this famous mine.

Captain About to Send Them
Home as Mutineers When
They Surrendered. ' â¢
-â â
The Chinese crew on the British steam
er Tartar has been in a state of mutiny
for three days, and it was only yester- !
day that they were brought to their
senses. Captain Pybus threatened to
send them all back to British Columbia
as mutineers anu fill their places with
white labor or another Chinese crew. I
i The threat had mora effect upon the crew '
than all the persuasive eloquence of Con- ,
sul Show Ting or the imperative orders of I
Consul General Ho Vow. The coolies I
were willing to go to almost any length j
to secure their end. but the loss of pay
and the "prospect of a term in a British
jail was too much of an alternative, so j
they went back to work.
When the Arizona (now the Hancock) ;
came here from Puget Sound under char
ter to the United States Government Her j
captain was in a similar dnemma to the j
one Captain Pybus has just got out of. i
Her Chinese crew said they were tired i
! of the voyage between Puget Sound and !
i China via Japan, and that there was no j
j mention of the Philippines in the articles. \
j They refused to go to Manila on the yes- i
i sel, unless they were paid an extra sum- j
equivalent to a month's wages." Their de- i
mand was ignored and the coolies went ,
on a strike. All the work in the engine
and lire rooms came to a stop and the
ship was not cleaned for several days.
No meals were cooked aboard and the
white members of the crew had to eat ;
ashore. The upshot ot the matter was !
that the Chinese won tne da*- and got I
the extra pay in advance, before they :
â  went to work again.
A number of the coolies who won their |
i first strike on the Arizona now form part :
of the crew of the Tartar. These clever !
! fellows knew all about getting the bet-
I ter of a shipmaster when nls vessel was <
j wanted in a hurry, so after the transport I
i had been a couple of days In port they j
\ Informed Captain Pybus that they would
! not go to Manila on the vessel unless
| they were given a bonus of an extra
I month's pay. This made the worthy I
| skipper angry and he told tne spokesman
, that . he wouldn't give the men a cent
! more than their wages, and if he heard
of any more such nonsense a number of
their liberties would be curtailed.
When tne captain's message was dcliv- \
ered to the Chinese they quit work in a
, body. The cooks left the galley, the wait
ers Btopoed cleaning up the -saloons and
| state rooms, the firemen and coal passers
i deserted the fireroom and the oilers left '
i the engineers to manage the machinery i
"themselves. The sailors who were clean
j ing up the decks Joined their brethren,
j and. the entire force adjourned- to the I
j forecastle and held a counsel of war.
They all came from a British "port on a
British ship, and therefore they had no â 
; right to land in the United States. Captain :
; Pybus is under bonds to see that none of
! the Chinese escape, and several custom- j
house officers were on watch to prevent
; their coming -ashore. ' No food was al- I
; lowed to be sent aboard to them, and soon [
the mutineers began to get hungry. They
saw the white members of the crew going I
and coming at meal time, so they deter- i
mined to eat also. The cooks went, back
to the galley, while a gang of the strikers
went to the storeroom in a body and over
powering the watchman helped them
: selves.
It was after this occurrence- that' Cap- j
j tain Pybus sent word to the Chinese con- |
I sulate. In answer to his message Consul !
i Show Ting soon appeared on the scene".
He called his countrymen together and I
explained the evil of their ways to them.
He pointed out' that they had signed an i
agreement, not only for a voyage to Puget
Sound and return to Hongkong, but also
to go wherever the captain might desire, i
to * take the ship,- so long as they were
back in the port of shipment at a given
time. He strongly emphasized the fact j
that their conduct was mutinous, but he
might as well have talked to a stone wall.
The crew of the Arizona got an extra I
month's pay without work for going to i
Manila, and they were striking to get the j
same or else they, would not work

sulate and reported the failure of his

neers, but ordered them peremptorily to
return to work or they would be dealt
with In the proper manner upon their
return to China. This staggered some of
the malcontents and they were ready to
go back to work, but the ringleaders
finally persuaded them to hold out, so
Consul General Ho Vow had to retire also
without having accomplished anything.
When the state of affairs was reported
to Captain Pybus be said:
"A coolie never got the* better of me.
yet, and I'm not going to. knuckle under
now. If they don't want to go to Manila,
why. ill just ship them back to Victoria.
B. <".. where they will get a taste of Brit
ish justice. They are mutineers and as
such shall go back to the sound in irons."
Captain Pybus was as good as his word.
He secured a permit from the Custom
bouse to transfer the Chinese, arranged
with the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany to send them north on the - I matilla
and was making arrangements for a crew
of white firemen to go to work to-day
when the Chinese heard of what was. go
ing on and at once weakened. They not
only gave up the idea of an extra month's
pay. but expressed themselves as per
fectly willing to make the voyage to Ma
nila, and not one of them grumbled when
he was docked three days' pay and fined
three days more for refusing duty.
The strikers caught a tartar and there
is a meek and lowly set of Mongels on
the Tartar these days. ' -, :

JUMPS IN FRONT OF
FAST MOVING TRAIN
CHARLES SA'LORT. a . collector for Joseph Lagomarslno, a vegetable
gardener at Twenty-ninth avenue and: California street, was. struck by
a train yesterday r and probably fatally injured on the Ferries and Cliff
House' road under circumstances which, savor of mental aberration or a
desire to make a dramatic exlt.lrom' this world. â¢ Â-. . Â> > . ,
Salorl" jumped from a- west-bound train directly In .front of another
coming from the opposite direction, but- It- is hot known whether lie miscalcu
lated the distance or whether he made a deliberate attempt to. commit suicide.
For ten years he had been making dally trips to the city, traveling to and fro
on the steam cars. There Is, an up grade at Twenty-ninth avenue. which ne
cessitates slackening the speed of the put-bound trains, and; it* has been Salo
ri's custom to jump off. at this point, which he could easily do : without danger
to life or limb, especially as he invariably chose the. side farthest from the In
side track. Yesterday; however, he varied the programme, and will probably
forfeit his life in consequence. . : . ' . . ..,',-.-
Salorl left the city shortly after noon, but instead of jumping off when the
train began to climb the, up grade at Twenty-ninth avenue, he waited until it
had reached Thirty-first avenue, and then. Instead of taking the clear side, he
leaped to the ground in the opposite direction, landing in the middle j of the
track in front of an oncoming train. ... ' ;
Engineer Sam Smith saw the man jump, but although he reversed his en-,
gine and applied the brakes as quickly as possible could not avert the acci
dent. Salorl was struck by the pilot of the. engine and, thrown .to the side ol
the track. He was picked up in an unconscious â¢ condition 'â¢'â  and j taken to the
house of his employer, a short distance away. " Drs. 'Cleary -and -Williamson,
were summoned, and .they found that Salori had sustained a fracture of the
base of the skull. They also found indications that he was injured internally.
After a careful examination they -announced that he' could not' possibly re

â *-4
Chief of Police Lees did not take his
usual Sunday off yesterday. He was all
worked up over the discovery of the plot
of 'trusties to effect a wholesale jail de
livery at the City Prison, coupled with
the' knowledge that daring thieves, iden
tity unknown, had broken into the police
property-room under his very nose and
rifled a dozen nlckel-in-the-slot machines
of their monetary contents. He refused
to give out any information on either af
fair.. - fy.U â ;: yy/yr/yfyjyy. fy T. :; r.i
"I'm making an investigation," he said
"and it will take at least four days to
finish it."
Down in the City Prison it was notice
able during the afternoon that the usual
gang of trusties was missing. This may
have been from the fact that George
Abernathy, George Graham and Thomas
Curley, the trio accused of being mixed
up in the plot for the prison delivery, had
been bundled off to the County Jail to
serve their sentences, or It may have been
the result of a first step in an effort by
the police authorities to do away alto
gether with the trusty system.
"The trusty system is all wrong, any
way," said one of the officers' of the
prison. "We ought to have free, white
labor in the prison to handle the prison
ers. Then we'd get me work done right.
As it is now, we are compelled to depend
on thieves to look after thieves. We are
forced to this because there is not suffi
cient money allowed to man the prison.
Till we get it, I suppose we will have to
keep on requisitioning the Sheriff for
crooks to do the work of honest men."
The investigation of the plot to break
jail is being carried on with energy
Every nook in the- City Prison Is being
searched, in the belief that- many knives
and pistols will be found to add to the
collections of weapons unearthed after
Trusty Curley weakened and peached on
his companions. If Captain Seymour has
succeeded in finding the bunch of dupli
cate keys to the doors which Curley says
were smuggled in to his companions in
j the conspiracy, he k/ieps that - fact to
; himself. He completed his investigation
' Last night, and although he does not say
i so it is plain that he believes the prop
i erty-clerk's room containing the nlckel
in-the-slot machines was entered from the
prison, and not from the outside corridor.
The fact that the locks in the door had
not been broken Is added proof to the
story of Curley that duplicate keys were
i smuggled into the prison by an ex-pris-
I oner. 7tSÃ__S__ ::<:â 'â  i â  â¢ fy'jy
The name of this ex-prisoner, which
was revealed to the police by the in-
I former, has not been divulged. They are
I looking for him with half a dozen detect
ives, and it is more than likely that he
j will be arrested within a short time.
When he is the mystery of the nickel-mi
