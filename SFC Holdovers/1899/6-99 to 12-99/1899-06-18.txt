i.f many military authorities, is far too
small to make rapid progress against [

more regulars <-.\n be spared from the
Final] force retained in the United
Slates, unless volunteers are enlisted
to replace them, and the President is
heing strongly urged not to delay any
longer calling for an adequate force of
volunteers.
It 1? pointed oiu that the President
is taKing too liic: a risk in â¢ fusing to
call for volunteers. It is true that (len
err.l otis lias said he does not need
more men. and he ought to be the
judge; hut it is also true that the pre
dictions of General Otis have not been
borne out by the progress of the cam
paign, and that all officers who have
returned from the Philippines and the
press dispatches which the censor has
nllowed tn romp fr>>ni Manila agree
that the force, asked for by General
Otis will not be sufficient.
The President is refraining from call
ing for more men, because he wishes
to avoid criticism of the opponents of
r. large army. Unless General Otis
should ask for I hem, ii is. apparent that
the administration has no intention of
sending him any more troops than
those covered by recent orders. Adju
tant General Corbin said â¢ â¢ day that
General Ottts would be supplied with
every '".in, every rifle, every equipment
that he might ask for. '"He has stated
repeatedly that 30,000 men would be
sufficient to control the situation, and
he knows more about it than the peo
ple who sit at their desks in the United
States and attempt to state the num

OF SLAUGHTFR
NEW YORK, June 17. â That J
rebellion in the Philippines q
should be put down once and for
all without a moment's unneces- q
sary delay, and that to accom- q
p/ish this American troops should q
be at once largely increased in o
numbers, is the almost unani- q
mous opinion of the American q
people as voiced by the Govern- 1
ors of States and the highest *
authorities in National Guard â¦
organizations. >
This is shown in the great +
number of answers received by +
the Herald to its questions ask- %
ing Governors and militia offi- -o
cers whether they believe the *
American force in the Philip- â¦
pines is strong enough to crush â¦
insurrection and, if not, how
many more men should be sent â¢Â»
to the islands. *
These answers show a vary 1'
decided opinion that more troops &
must be sent to Manila and that -.)
the number should be enough to 0
quickly overwhelm the rebels, O
whether the number be 50,000 0
or 100,000. The feeling is prac- Â«
tically universal that the pres- O
ent policy is more cosily in lives O
and less creditable to the coun-
try than it would be to raise
the army to 100,000 men or
more, hurry them to the Philip- O
pines and utterly destroy the q
rebels in one short, sharp cam- X
paign. There is an impatient â¦
desire to see the end of the â¦
war and a willingness to cheer- t.
fully stand by the President in 1
raising as many thousand more t.
men as may be needed to bring q
that end quickly. Â£

MANILA, June 17.â General Are
veloe, former aid on Agulnal
do'a staff, In an Interview to
day says the death of Luna
amounts to the loss of iTv per
cent of the insurgent army. He was
the only general in the north and his
death, In General Areveloe's opinion,
means the speedy extinction of the re
bellion In that quarter. The recent at
tack on Son Fernando, however, looks
as If the reported death of Luna is a
hoax. Loading Filipino. merchants say
General Luna was disliked by the
army, hoth for his (lorg outbursts of
temper and also as an avowed enemy
i-f Aguinaldo and other insurgent gen
erals. His death would make unity of
the insurgent army possible.
A leading English banker says If
Luna Is dead, why have not emissaries
come In from Aguinaldo. who is said
to be in favor of peace? Prisoners re-
I".;t that Aeuinaldo directed the attack
i n San Fernando.
Many hungry Filipinos were fed to
day at Paranaque and Las Pinas. The
Issue of rations this morning consisted
of rice and < anried roast beef. Some
of the boff issued was spoiled.

Genera! Wheaton was lighting near
Taguig, Franklin saw 500 insurgents
advancing under cover of the bluffs to
attack Wheaton's left flank. Th<> Na
pldan steamed unseen by the reb?ls to
within 500 yards of the shore, when she

threw th^m into confusion. The Fili

belabored his men with the flat of his
sword, striving to rally them, but they
would not stand to be cut down by the
murderous fire of the gunboat. Finally
th" rebels fled, the Napldan shelling
them until the last man disappeared.
General Wheaton first saw the in
surgents hs they were scrambling over
the hill in IliÃht. He was ignorant of
the reason for the demoralization, his
own fire drowning: that of the Napidan.
The gunboat then steamed down the

The Professor Further Says War

Through Peace Congress.

Till". HAGUE, June 17.â I
sec from late Renter tele
grams that Professor Sten
gel, accompanied by an Ameri
can delegate, Mr. Holls, left Hol
land for Germany to submit to
Emperor William an amended
plan for the milk and water arbi
tration suggested by Mr. White.
That was premature news.
Professor Stengel is still at The
Hague this afternoon, and 1 have
just interviewed him for the Call-
Herald. He is a tall, strong, gr a >*~
! haired man of over sixty, but
j with a still youthful appearance,
due to sober living.
The German savant, who is a
rather cynical-minded man. al
lowing no sentiment to enter into
his calculations of practical facts,!
immediately confessed that < ier
; many was absolutely averse to
, any kind of disarmameni in the
present state of Europe as an im
practicable dream.
"We will have none of it."" he
said. "The conference has re
nounced it. As to arbitration.
Germany is not opposed in prin
ciple, but certainly will not hear
lof permanent compulsory arbi
j tration. which belongs as much
to Ltopia as disarmament. We
won't allow the American pro
posal to pass. It is much too ab- ,
solute. The Russian proposal is
; more moderate by far and might
be acceptable. Anyhow, arbitra
tion will not restrict war. No two
great quarreling powers would i
resort to it or abide by an arbi
tration award. Besides which,
when popular sentiment calls for
war governments must wage it.
and who could compel a great
nation to submit to arbitration?:
Would you have the rest of the
world take up arms to compel
arbitration and thus bring about
a general war to prevent a re
stricted one?
"The present events point to
the vanity of arbitration. Eng
land, who pretends to love -it. will
have none of it in regard to the
Transvaal. Does any one believe
that Russia would admit arbifa-
tion between itself and Finland?'
Professor Stengel then told me
that the conference would not
take cognizance of the Polish,
Armenian. Finnish or any other
questions propounded from the
outside.
According t<> his views the real
result attained by the conference

SAN" RAFAEL, .Tun.' 17.â The
United States Smokeless Powder
Works, four miles north nf this
city, were blown up at a few
minutes before 1 o'clock this af
ternoon. Four men were killed and two
severely injured. There were six ex
plosions, four of which were heard in
San Rafael, and one was so terrific thai
the shock was felt for a radius of many
miles.
Tlu< unfortunate men who lost their
lives were John Secomb, Edward Se

Hollenbeck. Morrissey was struck by
a Hying beam and his head was
crushed in. while the other three were
blown to pieces and parts of their
bodies were picked uu hundreds of

John Farrell, tho enginei r, was se

life was saved by his forethought in
dropping to the ground as soon as the
first explosion took place. Frank Web
ster had every stitch of clothing
torn off his body and yet received not
a scratch, but was badly burned on the
arms and back. The awful force of the
explosion may be estimated from the
fact that pieces of the building were
hurled 200 yards around, while the
trunk of nnÂ» of the unfortunates was
picked up 4^o feet from where he stood

'My first visit, quite naturally, was to
General <>tis, from whom 1 had t" request
authority to |i;<ss through the American
lines. 1 was cordially received by the gen

with his campaign and if ho hope ( ; t,,
promptly terminate it.
" 'Ye.Â«.' he answered, 'I am satisfied
with the results achieved, and from this
time on I hope to accomplish in the quick
est manner possible the patriotic task con
fided to me by my Government. Unhap
pllj . l cannot deny that it will take a long
lime.'
"1 thanked <;Â«-neral <>tis for his gracious
reception and hastened to ask President
Sehurman of the American Philippines
ission for more ample information.
Mr. S< hurman, I am happy to have the
occasion of saying, Is a very remarkable
man of high Intelligence and of profound
erudition. Nobody could be more wormy
of the mission which has been entrusted
to him. Unhappily, I believe h.- Is powet
!â¢ s.- to obtain satisfactory results.
" 'Why.' I said to him, 'has not Amer'ca
established in the Philippines the protec
torate system like that which France !;Â»<
installed in Tunis and Annam? It is m
substance a disguised annexation and
would give you absolute satisfaction.'
" 'It is impossible,' replied Mr. Schur
n .in. 'and I will t.-ll you thÂ»- reason why.
At Tunis there Is a Bey ami at Annam an
Emperor, and your protectorate ;.= exer
cised over a stable government. Here
there is nothing of the kind. Wo are in
th.- presence or anarchy, and you cannot
establish a protectorate over a Govern
ment which does not exist.'
" "Hut. 1 I asked, 'in default of a protec
â¢ - will you accord to the Fillpln is the
Fame regime as .-xists between Canada
and Great Britain that is to say. a s-.rt
of autonomy with the recognition of
Ame> lean sovereignty?'
" 'Yes.' answered Mr. Sohurman, after a
moment's reflection. '1 do not see. so far
as 1 am concerned, any objection to the
iishment of such a Bystem. Besides,
it Is outlined in the last proclamation
which we addressed to rhe Filipinos. In
â  first place, we it sist that th.- sov
erelgntj r>f the United States l>.- aci

â an people will never give way. But after
that we are quite disposed toward any
rstanding with the Inhabitants of
those islands.'
"II remained for me to see Admiral
Dewey. 1 had a very great desire to see
and know th< man who enjoys su.-h popu
larity in America and wlmsn audacious
action at Cavite has i>epn very much ad
mired in France. The admiral received
me on hoard thr- Olvnipia and I lost no
time In complimenting him on th.- victory
which he had won. Very modestly the
admiral replied that the greater part of
th.- credit was due to his sailors, wti" had
behaved very gallantly, and to his officers,
who hud seconded him so well.
"'And now, admiral,' I said, 'what do
you think of the Bituation?'
" Tn thetirst place.' he answered. ]ha\-e

Schurman haa nearly every day with the
Filipinos' delegates, and in any cas<\

'" "Hut." I replied, 'should It not be roe

ably?'
" Vertainly yes.' answerer! the admiral,
"iind I render them full Justice on that
point. They tight well, hut are children
Incapable of military tactics."
" 'At the same time.' I suggested. "I
think you rvught to recognize that on innd
thej conducted the campaign aga'nst the
icis very well.'
" 'That i- true,' said the admiral, 'but
> -!nr<- y,,u have touched on thÂ«- subject I
sniii! be obliged to you if you repeat the
following statement In Franco:
" 'AguTnaldo, during the war with
Bpain, was not our ally, as has been
claimed. We never made a treaty of al
liance with him and we never promised
him anything. We had a common enemy.
He acted on his side and we on ours.
There has never been any understand
ing.'
"Having thus been enlightened upon the
sentiments of the high personages upon
the American side. It remained to me to
tain the views of the Filipino leaders.
One evening I visited Florintine Torres,
Philippine Commissioner, of Manila.
Torres was a magistrate under Spanish
ml.- and is a very intelligent man. He
said:
" 'The i" sition of the Philippine Com
mission is a very difficult one. We are
'.â â¢ing wh.\t we can to bring about paci
fication, hut -when we shall have found a
solution of the Question with Mr. Schur
man it will be necessary to <;uise Agutn
aldi to accepi it and there will be a great
dillloulty.'
" 'Why do you fear the opposition of
Aguinaldo? Is he an ambitious man?'
" "No; but he has illusions. !)â¢â  hopes
for tin- Intervention of the great Euro
pean powers, as in Crete, and he even
counts on the co-operation of Japan.'
" "And you. sir, for what do you hope?'
" 'Oh. as for myself. 1 hope the war
will S'H.n !,e finished, for it is ruining us.
We landed proprietors would accept <
government similar to that of Canada.
We in no way wish for the departure of
the Americans, for in that case our for
tunes would be swop; away. It is-- not only
h question of Aguinaldo an<J his troops,
of a nationalist movement, but above all,
of a socialist and revolutionary move
ment, treated by the insurrection.'
"The lower class of people and many offi
cers are military socialist*. I will cite for
example, Luna, who for .1 long time fre
quented the Socialist clubs of Europ â ;
Banlioko, who at one time hail influence
among certain Socialist committees of
America, and the poet, Paterno. who is a:i
enthusiastic Socialist. AI3O, rest well as
sured, the movement is directed mut.h
more against the capitalists, to whateviT
nation they may belong, than against the
Americans.
"I afterward had interviews successive
ly with Beveral Influential Filipinos, no
tably with Gregorio Araneto, the first
Minister of Justice of the Government of
Aguinaldo. They all confirm the st;uo
ments of Torres.
"1 was struck with the fine presence of
i your soldiers. They are big men, strong,
| supple and agile, who hear testimony to
the beauty of the American race. But
unhappily I know that precisely on ac
count of their physical strength they ex
perienced great difficulty in enduring the
climate of the Philippine Islands. This
â  â  in- paradoxical, and yet it is so. In
warm and damp countries it Is indisput
able that very vigorous men do not endure
, the climate as well as smaller and more
degenerate Individuals.
"Your soldiers light with great bravery,
but it is impossible not to remark the lack
of discipline among the volunteers. The
latter conduct themselves well under fire,
but they pay little attention to obedience
to their 'chief!;.
"I think it Is absolutely necessary for
the success of your conquest to replace
the volunteers as quickly as possible by
regular troops.
"In any case it does not seem to me
possible to hope for a complete victory
during the rainy season. It seems to be
Incontestable in this conquest that for
â  the Interior 100,000 men will not he too
many. We know In France what the sys
| tern of 'little parcels' has cost. It :s an
example which the United States would
do well not to follow."

â^
; BRADY AND O'ROURKE SETTLE
PRELIMINARIES.
Contest to Take Place in a Twenty-
Four Foot Ring Before the
Club Offering the Largest
Purse.
Special Dispatch to Thp Call.
NEW FORK, June 17.â Preliminary
arrangements for a tlarht between
James J. Jeffries ;ui<l Thomas Sharkey
for tin- heavyweight championship of
the world were made this afternoon
during a conference between William
A. Brady and Turn O'Kourke, mana
gers of the two pugilists. The confer
ence was held at the Vanderbilt Hotel.
Under the arrangements the contest
will take place on or about October 23,
before th< club offering the largest
purse.
The meeting between Bradj and
O'Rourke was free from exchanges of
questionable humor that usually mark
meetings of this eh;! racier. Each man
desired to make the match, and each
man quickly K"t down to business. As
soon as the meeting began Brady said
thai in view of the fact that Sharkey
objected to a side bet, Jeffries would
waive a side wager.
That feature settled, Brady suggested
George Siler of Chicago as the referee.
< >'Rourke said he considerd Siler a com
p tt-nt man and well qualified t<> fill the
position, but that ho understood Shar
key ha<l personal reasons for not wish
in)-' to have the Chicago man officiate.
lit- asked Brady to alh>w the naming
of the referee to >?o over until Monday.
O'Rourke suggested that the fighters
be permitted to wear bandages on the
hands, but "Billy" Delaney, Jeffries'
trainer, objected. Brady also protested.
Delaney said that Sharkey's hands
were as good as Jeffries' and he should
ask for no favors. It was decided to
postpone further discussion i>n that
point until Monday. Both points prob
ably will be satisfactorily settled.
It was agreed that the contest should
be held before the club offering the
highest purse, the winner of the con
test to take the entire amount. In or
der to give all dubs a fair chance to
bid for the match, it was decided not
to make a choice before September 1.
Bids are to be sent to "Mattie" Clune.
Bach principal will post a forfeit of
$2500 to guarantee his appearance at
th. ring, and the club obtaining the
match will have to post (5000 to stand
as forfeit money. The entire purse
money will have t" be posted by the
club ten days prior to th" battle.
Straight Marquis of Queensberry
rules will govern the boutâ that is. the
men will be allowed to hit while one
arm is free and will have to protect
themselves on breakaways. The ring
will be a twenty-four-foot affair,
Brady, on behalf of Jeffries, held out
for an eighteen-foot ring:, hut O'Rourke
said that the regulation twenty-four
foot ring was good enough for Sharkey.
It was decided to leave the size of the
ring to the club controlling the match.
The bout will be restricted to twenty
five rounds.
After the conditions of the match had
been agreed upon Brady, on behalf of
the Coney Island Sporting < 'lub. in
whose arena Jeffries won the cham
pionship of the world from Fitz
slmmons, offered a purse of (50,000 for
the match. Brady asked O'Rourke,
who 1b manager of the Lenox Athletic
club, how large a purse hi.'- organiza
tion would give for the contest.
O'Rourke replied that it would be as
large if not larger than that of any
rival club.
In the meantime Jeffries will not be
idle. He will leave for Europe i:?xc
month. On his arrival irt England he
will issue a challenge to fight any
pugilist in Great Britain, the match to
take place before the National Sporting
(Tub or any other reputable organiza
tion. He will meet any English lighter
for ten rounds or to a finish.

Rounds.
SALINAS, June 17.â Thomas Sharkey
arrived In this city to-day. He received
many telegrams from various persons
In regard to his match with Jeffries.
To-night, when asked about his plans,
Sharkey said:
"I am just tickled to death with the
match with Jeffries. I received news of
it to-day. I ought to get a better purse
than $50,000 and wired O'Rourke to that
effect, but I will accept that amount. 1
am now on my mettle and don't need
any training to whip Jeffries. I have
been down in Paso Hobles for a little
rest and to take the mud baths.
"I weighed I*7 pounds this morning. I
! will whip my man when I meet him at
j the Coney Island Club in October. I
j can do it inside of ten rounds, too. I
I will be In San Francisco at 4 o'clock

details thus far arranged for the fight
are <>. K. to me. I'll fight Jeffries the
twenty-five rounds, or 100 if need be."

REFRIGERATOR
LINE TO BE PUT
ON BY GROWERS
Owners of Orchards Decide in
Favor of Stephens'
Scheme.
SACRAMENTO, .June 17.â There was a ;
convention of fruit growers in Sacra
mento to-day, called for the purpose of :
hearing the report of the executive com- i
mittee appointed at a growers' conven
tion in this city a few weeks ago. and to :
adopt a plan of organization. It was cvi- |
dent before the convention met thai there
would be a lively controversy concerning
the method of organization. There was
one faction represented by a majority on
â  the executive committee that favored a .
refrigerator car line, to !><â¢ .owned and
controlled by the growers. While this
plan included the formation of an organi
zation to control the marketing of fruit,
I the market was made so subsidiary to the
\ car line as to be almost lest sight of. .
The minority was known to advocate a â 
plan calling for an organization among
! the growers along a line almost identical j
with that of th( Raisin Growers' Associa
tion of Fresno, and in no way refrring to
a car line.
I; was evident when the convention was
called that there would be a clash be
. tween the contending factions. and
friends of the organization feared it might
end in defeat for the entire plan.
The meeting was called to order at 2i
o'clock this afternoon in the Senate cham
ber and the majority and minority reports
I were read. W. A. Fountain of Newcastle,
a member of the executive committee and
the only one who signed the minority re
port, moved its adoption. He contended
that tli" one thing for the growers to do
was to effect a strong central organiza
tion and pledge the growers of the State
to ship through this to agencies estab
lished by the organization in the Bast.
He contended that in this way growers
, would absolutely control in time the en
tire deciduous fruit crop of the State.
' and when they controlled even a fair per
centage of tills they would lie in a posi
tion to ('leal directly and make contracts
with refrigerator car lines. The organiza
tion, once perfected, would result, he de
clared, in a competition for business
among the various car lines, which would
bring about a reduction in refrigeration
charges a:- great as could be brought
aboul if the growers owned their own
lines, it was further to lie commended
upon the ground that this reduction would
! â¢â¢ effected without the investment Of a
cent of capital by growers.
Fountain declared that on the cither
hand. If the majority report were ad ipted
and a car line obtained without the per
' fection of an organization, such as out
lined in the minority report, the grower
would be worse off than before, if such
a thing could be. The firms of Karl and
Porter, controlling as they did the mar- |
kets of the East, would be fully as pow
erful as before the growers' line was es
tablished and would materially injure the
gri iwers' corporal lon.
R I. Stepnens of Sacramento, chair
man of the executive committee and chief
advocate of the majority report, contend
ed that refrigeration was the key to the
whole situation. He said that by Its con
; troi of refrigeration the cnr-line com
] bine was in a position to give rebates to
the growers that would militate disas
trously against the grower. He declared ;
that with a refrigeration charge to the

AT A STANDSTILL ON
THE ARBITRATION PLAN
THE HAGUE, Juno 17.â 1t is impor
tant that the present situation regard
inK the board of arbitration question
be clearly understood. The work of the
peai â¢ conference has been suspended
on this point and probably will not be
resumed for Borne days. On semi-offi
cial authority it is said the situation is
practically this:
The German Government was op
posed on principle to an organized ar
bitration court, and it is found that
these views existed long prior to the
conference and that Instructions to the
effect were piven to the German dele
gates. The conviction obtained in Ber
lin that other powers, notably France,
would instruct their delegates Fimi
larly.
As the conference proceeded the spirit
of conciliation advanced and the desire
tn accomplish important permanent re
sults was manifested. With this grew
up schemes fur an organized arbitra
tion board, notably the British propos
als, to which nearly all the membi-rs
rallied whh the authoritative support
of their respective governments. This
at once left the German delegates in
a peculiar condition, for which they
were not prepared. The difficulty was
not at The Hague, but at Berlin. â¢ In
order to relieve the situation. Count
yon Minister, head of the German dele
gation, after a long conference with his
colleagues at Scheveningen, decided to
dispatch Dr. Zorn and Baron yon Sten
gel to inform the Emperor personally
of the condition of affairs.
In the meantime efforts bad been j
made to find means of conciliation by j
tho means of a limited board estab- I
lished at The Hague, under the ordin
ary representatives of the powers, i
which was proposed by Andrew D. :
White, head of the American delega- >
tion.- This plan Dr. Zorn and Baron .
yon Stengel have been commissioned
to plead for to Emperor William. The
question of the moment, therefore, is
what his Majesty will reply. The most
important fact is that the German dele- j
gation from Berlin were accompanied t
by Frederick Holls, secretary of the
American delegation, who was able to
explain fully the American plan.
In the meantime the delegates of the I
great powers have been merely mark- i
ing time. The delegates .of Russia,
Great Britain and France have held
several meetings, concerning which the
delegates preserve silence, probably '
because no definite decision has been
reached.
There is a growing belief, however, i
offer, that it would end in the associa
tion'a disruption.
Man;.' growers spoke on both sides of i
the question and a spirited and henied
debate followed. At times the debate bor
dered on acrimony.
Fountain of Newcastle contended that
it was only the small shippers who were
interested in a growers' car line; tiiat
these imped by using the money of the
association in obtaining cars for their
fruit to become perhaps rivals in time of
Karl and Porter. He referred to Chair
man Stephens as one of these small ship
pers and declared that the interest of the
grower was In every way opposed to xho
Interest of the shipper, no matter whether
that shipper were large or small.
Stephens retorted by calling attention to
the fact that Fountain as a member of
the executive committee had attended all
of its meetings, and had sat silently by
while the committee was advocating a
refrigerator car line and growers were
subscribing for stock, and he further
stated that Fountain himself, at the first
Newcastle meeting, had signed the agree
ment calling for a refrigerator oar line,
and had pledged himself to take shares in
the same: and at a subsequent meeting in
Newcastle when it was found necessary
to modify the agreement in a few minor
details, Fountain had again affixed his
signature. He characterized his action In
now opposing the plan as peculiar and
unaccountable.
Fountain answered by Btating he was
opposed to a refrigerator car line from
the beginning and that the agreement
which he had Bigned was the effect >f a
compromise in the executive committee
after a wrangle of several days and
nights He said that he had not opposed
the plan at the meetings hHd throughout
the State, as be did noi want to do any
thing to Injure the general plan of or
ganization.
After a considerable How <>f eloquence
and much heated argument a motion was
made to adopt the minority report. The
vote on this motion was 17 for to 23
against. The Newcastle growers, who
had subscribed for $17,500 out of 125,000
worth of stock taken, voted in favor of
the minority report. When this result
was announced ;i motion was at once
made to adopt the majority report, which
calls for a refrigerator car line, to be
owned and controlled by the growers.
This motion was carried by a vote of
â¢12 to IS.
While there is no doubt that some of
those who favored the minority report
Will withdraw from the organization the
number will, be very few and the consen
sus of opinion among tin- growers is that
to-day's convention has taken a long step
toward advancing the Interests of the
California fruit industry, no matter what
may be thought regarding the plan to bo
pursued. The car line which the growers
propose controlling probably will ,be
leased, as tlv capital on hand is not 1 i tc â¢ ly
in the immediate future to be.'anywhere
near sufficient for the building of car.-.
As a sort of compromise it is believod
that the directors, before taking any
steps toward controlling a line of their
own. will first ascertain what kind of
rates cr;i lie obtained from car lines now
In California or th<-> East.
SANTA ROSA. June 17.â At a meeting
of the Sonoma County Horticultural So
ciety this afternoon a resolution was
passed indorsing the movement In <'ali

bine. Many speakers spoke against the

VOLUNTARY RETIREMENTS

WASHINGTON, .Tun.- 17.â Judge Advo

authorizes the Presldem to retire officers
of each grade, providing a certain speci

nually in these grades through natural
causes. The Judge Advocate General
holds that the ait requires thai a sufii

to be placed mi the retired list to cause
the pn scribed number of vacancies, and
applying this rule to the existing naval
lists he flnds that there will l>.- no cap

vacancies and the law prescribing twenty
nine, and no lieutenants retired; the total
number of vacancies, forty in the higher

luha, a Kanaka diver and fisherman, at
noon to-day shot and killed a Kanaka
woman who passed as his wife. He
then shm twice at her sister. Mrs.
George Wlmmer, one <if the bullets
causing a serjous wound in her thig-h.
Seizins his two-year-old child, he
dashed it with great force to the
ground, in the hope of ending its young
life. Having thus distributed destruc
tion about hÂ«> turned the revolver on
himself and fired a shot that killed him
almost instantly.
Kaluha had for a number of years
been employed .-is a diver on the Gov
ernment snagboat Seizer. The boat has
had no occasion for his services of late,
and so he has put in his time as a river
fisherman, making his home at Vernon
Sutter County.
The woman with whom he lived came
down from Vernon a few days am> to
visit her sister, one of the victims of
to-day's tragedy. Kaluha followed yes
terday. He was not a drinking man,
but, it appears, was short of money,
and a few minutes before the killing h"
was heard to ask hj.s putative wife for
a few dollars.
It is not believed that tho murder
had its origin in this incident, but
rather in the fact that Kaluha suspect
ed the woman of unfaithfulness.
Mrs. Wimmer and the child will re- |
cover. The tragedy occurred at mid- i
day in one of the most thickly settled
portions of the city, and part of it was
witnessed by two painters, who were !
perched high on some rigging on a j
nearby building. They were powerless |
to prevent the fiendish deed of the!
frenzied Kanaka.
MARRIAGE OF MISS
WILDER A SURPRISE
Honolulu Agog Over the Announce
ment That the Heiress Is a
Bride.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 17.â The preatest
surprise Honolulu has had in some tinie
is the announcement of the marriage of
Helen K. Wilder. The young woman is an
island girl, but is well known in Snn Fran- I
Cisco. Honolulu people are surprised be
cause the marriage was a secret one, and
was kept very quiet for two weeks after.
The marriage took place in May 16. The
same day the bride left for Fran
cisco, leavinff her husband. H. J. Craft, to
break thf> news to her mother. Miss
Wilder, or Mrs. Craft, is still in San
Francisco, though her husband exj
her home at an early date.
The young woman ls a well known
lifrure in Honolulu on account of her
nectlon with the Humane Society. She. la
the special officer of the organization,
: ports a i'a'ipi and has power to arrest
brutal drivers.
About two years ;ipn she was enpagÂ°d
to marry George Semmes, a lieutenant in
the United Spates navy. The engagement
\ui^ broken off for some reason. About
i.];. year ago hjer, ensagemen/t to Frank
linger was anrVouftcea. l'n?er is a San
Francisco clubman. Miss Wilder's rela
tives believed that I*r.KÂ°r wanted ihe
young woman's money, so the property
was tied up hard and fast and placed in
the hands of a trustee. Then I'nger went
invaj .
Miss Wilder became tired of announcing
engagements and evidently decided to get
married first and announce the engaÂ«e
meni afterward. Her husband Is a re
cent arrival from Butte City. He is a j
capable and respectable young man. The
bride is the daughter of V\o late S. C. j
Wilder. She is rich in her own right, and
is connected with some of the host fami
lies in Honolulu.

the record-breaking mile and a quar

For Imp, the first mare to win in the
Suburban history, clipped two-fifths
of a second off the Suburban record
and won as she pleased, although, to
be sure, the boy up, "Long Shot" Tur

kicking at everything within reach. A 1
ltfilf past 4 the starter thought h" had
them In line and called them. Briar
Bweet refused to break and they were
called ba>k. Ten minutes later they
got another break. They were all in
perfect line, but Maher on Banastar
did not like his position and pulled his
mount up, for which he was lectured
by the starter. Five minutes â¢
Imp and Briar Sweet and Banastar be
ing the offenders. Another break came
and this time only the inside wine;
moved. Briar Sweet was responsible
for the next break.
Nine attempts were made by the
starter. Then, at last, the Hag did fall.
They were off! The stand rose to it.
The crowd on the lawn strained against
the ropes. A mighty cry burst from
25,000 throats. "They're off!" And SO
they were. And liana-star, with a for
tune on him, was left standing.
Imp. George Keene, Tragedian, Ban
nockburn and the rest â away they
came, Bannockburn thus early chal
lenging the leaders and showing form
which threatened the best afoot. By
the time they got to the stand George
I Keene was still making the pace, but J
Briar Sweet was on his flank, and Tur
ner, with Imp well in "hand, was third,
rfdln*? a bit wide of the others and
awaiting his chance. Filigrar.es nose
was bobbing behind him and he was
doming with a rush, but the effort was
premature and at the first turn Keene
and Briar Sweet were leading, with
Imp well within striking distance and i
Filigrane next. As they entered the
back stretch these were practically all
together. Latson, who had made a
spurt, fell back. The crowd did not
know. To make it more puzzling, Tra
gedian shot up from the ruck into the j
foremost bunch. But it was only a
momentary effort. Her race was run.
Turner, riding straight and touching â 
neither whip nor spur, let Imp out a
peg and she went to the front. Ban
nockburn was so close then and
seemed to have so much to spare that j
the crowd arose and shouted "I'.un-.
nockburn! Bannockburn!"
But Turner had chosen his time and
th" black mare, striding beautifully,
went to the fore and opened up three [
lengths of daylight between her tail j
and the game brown horse behind, who
ran neck and neck with George Keene.
Briar Sweet was coming and looked
still dangerous.
The stand was a sight to see. The
dress parade so noticeable early in the j
day was forgotten. Men and women
Stood up ami shouted "Imp;" "Ban
nockburn !"
They were coming around the last :
turn. They were in the stretch at last
and first to show came the black thor- i
oughbred Imp, with Bannockburn ;
striving to close. For a moment he
gained, and then it looked as if he
might win. But the mare â the first
that ever went the prize-day distance
âhad much in reserve, and Turner took
her away a foot or two at every Jump.
But he was not sure. There was that
deadly furlong or two to go, where so
! many had fallen by the wayside be
fore him. There was a hoarse cry from
the stand. The crowd on the green
surged against the fence and were car
rying it away. Bannockburn was closÂ»
ing the gap. |
fine furlong more! Turner glanced
over his shoulder. The cry of the grand
ptand thousands was in his ears. He
arose in his stirrups. Ip went his
whip. Before it fell the fleet black
mare seemed to feel it. Rannockburn
was feeling lash and spurs, hoping to
head Imp in front and fearing game
Warrenton. who had come out of the
ruck and was driving behind for the
place.
Before Turner's whip fell in that last
furlong Imp was away. The heart
heats of the mighty crowd kept time ,
with the thundering hoofs. Two lengths
and more Imp lead Bannockburn, and !
yet the Western boy, riding his first
great winner, tickled her flanks with â 
the lash. Rh<Â» arose to it as a horse un- !
used to the whip and in a stride or two
gained more on Bannockburn, who had ;
been dogged to his best.
That was all that was needed. "Imp! I

imp! ' roared stand and green, and the
game mare went under the wire in
record time, with Bannockburn two
lengths away, leading Warrenton by
three lengths. Warrenton holding Taral
and Ben Holladay by a half-length.
She made the distance in 2:05 4-5, beat
ing the Brooklyn handicap record,
which was 2:06 1-f. and threatening the
track record, which is li : 05.
Imp is a five-year-old black mare by
l imported Wagner-Fondling and owned
, by the Western firm of Harness &
Brosman. The best performance shown
thus far this year by Imp was at
Gravesend on June 14, when she shoul
dered 126 pounds in a handicap race at
a mile and an eighth and fairly ran
away from her field, winning by throe
lengths in the fast time of 1:53%.
The other stake of the day was the
Double Event. The Prince of Mel
bourne was a hot favorite and fully
justified the choice, for after indulging
Colonel Roosevelt with the lead to the

HISTORY OF THE WINNER
Great Mare the Idol of the People
of Chillicothe.
NEW YORK, June 17.â Imp, the first
of her sex to win one of the preat
spring handicaps, who succeeded when
Gorgo, Pirenzi, Los Angeles and all
the best that went before her failed,
is a hip, rag-god, Mark mare, not pretty
to look at, but a phenomenon when
there is racing to he done. For four
Beasons Bhe lias been on the turf, and,
racing early and late, she ha? won on
all tracks. East and West, in all ports
Of company. Her greatest reputation is
in the West, however, where from Cin
cinnati, where she won a maiden race
as a two-year-old, to Chica 'o, she has
gone to the front and galloped to death
all the best that could be opposed to
her. Her victory to-day was her sec
ond effort for the Suburban, she hav
ing failed in the race won by Tillo last
yea r.
She failed in the Brooklyn handicap,
though prior to her triumph to-day,
she picked up two good races, the last
a mile and a furlong in 1:53%, carrying
126 pounds.
Imp is five years old, by Wagner, the
bod of Prince Charlie. Her dam is Fond
ling, by Fonso; second dam Kitty Her
ring, by Chillicothe. On the dam side
she is of D. R. Harness', her present
owner, home breeding for generations.
Mr. Harness is a farmer of Chilli
cothe, Ohio, and one of the oldest turf
men in America. Nearly forty years ago
his colors were familiar on every promi
nent American racecourse. He owns
a large farm near Chillicothe and there
he has bred winners for nearly a half
century. Imp is the idol of the veteran
turfman's heart, and he had supreme
confidence In her winning some of the
great events of the East.
When Imp returned to Chillioothe
last year after having been campaigned
in the East the townspeople turned out
p n masse. The occasion was made a
great public holiday. The Mayor and
citizens met her at the station with
bands of music and escorted her in
triumph through the streets to her
stable. When she started recently in
the Brooklyn Handicap and was beaten,
Chlllicothe was in mourning and all her
betting men went broke. The return
of the great mare on the next occasion
will probably be the occasion of one of
the most remarkable demonstrations of
its character ever witnessed.
The record for the Suburban distance,
one and a quarter miles, is held, over
the circular course, jointly by David
Tenny and Algol, both four-year-olds.
Tenny ran the distance at Washington
Park. July 16, IS9S, carrying 100 pounds,
in 2:04%. On the same track one week
later Algol duplicated the performance,
carrying 107 pounds. Banquet covered
the distance in 2:03% over the straight
course at Monmouth Park mi July 17,
1890.
Maher Fined and Suspended.
NEW YORK, June 17.â The directors of
the Coney Island Jockey Club to-day fined
Jockey Maher $200 for abusing the horse
Banastar. Maher was suspended from
riding for ten days for willfully breaking
up starts in the Suburban race.

SLOAN HAS A RIVAL
IN LITTLE REIFF
Riding of the Midget Jockey Ap
plauded by English Race-
Goers.
LONDON, June 17.â To<l Sloan promises
to have a rival In little "Johnnie Ueiff,
who was accorded a most enthusiastic re
ception when he won the new biennial
1 stakes at Ascot on June 14, on Sir Waldie
Griffith's chestnut filly, Betty Field. He
looked like a child of ten and was all
over the place with the tillv. but straight
ened her in workmanlike fa-shion, and,
riding in Sloan's style, won very easily,
whereupon the women cheered even more
than the men. Such a recognized au
thority as George Courtell. editor of the
Sporting Times, says that, looking at
Beiff's weight, skill ami self-possession,
Ufcre must lie a great career before him.

ARTICLE XIII.
Neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment
for crime, whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted, shall
exist within the United States or
any place subject to their juris
diction.
VICTORIA. B. C, June 17.â The Su
preme Court of Hawaii on June 9
handed down a decision in the case of
the Honomo Sugar Company vs. A.
Sayewiz and N. Gzeluch for deserting
contract service, overruling the excep
tions of the defendants and affirming
the judgment of the Circuit Judge.
These men deserted in September, LB9B.
They were arrested, found guilty and
fined, and upon failure to pay the fine
were put in jail. They appealed to the
Supreme Court on the ground that the
penal clause of the labor law was
against the constitution <>f the United
States, and that their imprisonment
was therefore illegal.
After referring to the Peacock, Ed
wards and other cases, the court says:
"These cases practically determine the
point that the provisions of the con
stitution of the United States above
cited are not in force here during the
present transition period."
This Bettles the validity of the penal
clause in the contract labor laws as the
matter now stands.
The importation of Italians as labor
ers upon some plantations is now defi
nitely decided upon. A number of man
agers have made application for this
class of people, and they will almost
certainly form a part of our population
in the course of a few months. ,
To Consul Schaefer is due the credit
in this matter. As the representative
of Italy in the islands, his word had
groat weight with the Government of
Kins Humbert; and he has been un
tiring in his efforts to collect and for
ward information. The result has been
that the Italian Government is ready
to permit an extensive emigration to
the islands.
There is some difference between the
terms upon which the Italians come
to the islands. In the case of the Por
tuguese the local Government bore 30
per cent of the cost of bringing the
families. In the case of the Italians
the local government will give 50 per
cent toward the cost of families. The
last Legislature allowed $50,000 toward
assisting in Immigration of either
Americans or Europeans, and that ap
propriation is available for the Italians.
JOHN CLYDE SULLIVAN
MADE A PAYMASTER
Commission Given to the Man Who
Was Dismissed From the Navy
for Grave Offenses.
WASHINGTON, June 17.â President Mc-
Klnley issued a. commission to-day 10
John Clyde Sullivan as paymaster In the
United States navy. Hy this action hs
has restored to the naval service a man
who was dismissed in 1894 on charges of
embezzlement, rendering false and fraud
ulent returns, making false and fraudu
lent report and disobeying orders of the
Secretary of the Navy. Sullivan declared
that a great wrong was done htm. and he
succeeded in getting through jhe last
Congress an act authorizing the President
to appoint him a paymaster, with the rel
ative rank of lieutenant commander at
the foot of the list of paymasters hav
ing that rank. A determined opposition
met the friends of Sullivan when they
urged the President to act under this law,
and it is stated that Secretary Long w is
one of those who objected to the appoint
ment. Sullivan was formerly stationed at
Mare Island.

Copyrighted, IS!W, by the Associated Pn
LONDON. Juno 17.â According
to a dispatch sent to a news
agency here from Pretoria, seven
British warships have arrived at
Inyack Island (St. Marys Isl
and), at the entrance of Delagoa
Bay. There is no confirmation "f
the report, and in semi-official
circles it is looked upon as being
untrue.
LONDON, Junp 17.â The Transvaal situ
ation is still the all-absorbing topic of < lis
cussion in Great Britain, and even the
Continent has caught the disease although
in a less virulent form. Outwardly the
question sc. Ms u> have advanced t>ut lit
tle, tbou^rii those who an- inside think
the cause of the CJltlandtrs has gone up
several pegs. 'Ph.- publication of th<
Transvaal bli)e>book with ;â¢ emphatic
denunciation of Transvaal methods, set
ting forth in measured paragraphs the al
leged political, financial and judicial in
compfitency of the administration "i
President Kruger and adopting as pari of
the Government's programme all the
grievances of the Uitlantlers, constitutes
a matter of the highesi import. It was
unmistakably a warning to the 1
vaal as well as an indication to the people
of South Africa generally thai tlv- Gov
ernment has arrived at> a fixed decision,
impossible to recede from, and there are
not lacking indications that the hint has
not b< en lost at Pretoria,
Although it is difficult to separate facts
from fiction in the multiplicity i
Hiding stories, it is the general impres
sion of those in a position to know that
the conciliatory dispatches Which Dr.
Leyds, the representative in Europe of
the Transvaal, received June 11. r< pres< nts
the true situation, while President
Kruger's deflani s] eh of the same day
was merely Intended for home consump
tion. Thr opinion is now growing that the
delay necessitated in awaiting Sir Alfrtd
Mllner's full report of the Bloemfontein
conference will make a way for a pacific
settlement. As an official in the close
confidence of the Government declared, it
would pive President Kruger "time to se<
his house in order."
But unless the talked of concessions are
speedily inaugurated, momentous conse
quences are predicted. The position in
England of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies. Mr. Chamberlain . however, is
readily declining and the emphatic sug
gestion is heard in Influential quarters to
transfer the conduct of the negotiations
from the Colonial to the Foreign Office.

LONDON, June IT.â With reference- to
the reports that the cruisers Albany and
New Orleans, purchased here by the
United States Government, have" been
round top-heavy and unseaworthy the cor
respondent of the Associated Press saw-
Colonel Watts, the naval constructor of
the Armstrongs, who said:
"If the Albany and New Orleans are not
seaworthy many of the ships nf the Brit
ish navy, built at the same time, are also
useless, as the Albany and the New Or
leans were built from designs sanctioned
by Sir William White, chief naval con
structor, and bear comparison In sp^M
and every other essential with any vessel
of their class built at that date."

SEARCHLIGHT'S FAST RACE
California Pacer Lowers Track Record
at Denver.
DENVER, June 17. -This was the best
day of the meeting at Overland Park, the
crowd being Immense and the racing very
fine. Searchlight, the fast California stal
lion, took- the 2:05 pacing race, and estab
lished a new record for the track. He did
i; sn easily as to justify the bookmakers in
refusing to take money against him.
Raymond M., who lias been a winner at
this meeting, and W. W. P., who holds
the two-mile record, might, it is claimed,
have been distanced if Searchlight had
been urged. In the third race 1 Don't
Know took third money, after having
been practically left at the post. In the
fourth Jockey Jackson was knocked off
Mountain Queen, but escaped serious in
jury. The betting was heavy, there being
two or three favorites in each running
race, and all the winners !'â¢â !â¢>Â£: steadily
played. The weather was warm and the

In a Pitiable Condition, the Wife of
an American Tourist Reaches
th.6 Cabin of a
Settler.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 17.â Eight
days' of wandering in the dense
Australian bush with scarcely any food
except the wild fruits that could be
gathered, was the recent experience of
Sirs. James Yeoman, an American woman
from Tennessee. Mrs. Yeoman and her
husband had been traveling through
Australia for several months, hunting and ;
fishing and visiting points of Interest. .
They left Melbourne early in May and 1
went out on the upper Murray on a win- j
ter opossum hunting trip. !
After having been in the camp for a !
few days, Yeoman went out to tix up some â¢
snares and never returned. The woman j
remained alone in camp for two days and j
then went In search of her husband, but j
failed to find him. She then wandered for j
eight days, subsisting on nettles, fern â¢
roots and raw. opossum flesh.
Finally she proceeded to follow down a
stream of water, hoping to reach a set- J
tlement. While traveling she encountered j
a mob of wild dogs and had to take refuge !
in a tree. The animals, the woman said, j
crowded around the tree for several j
â  hours, snarling, snapping and showing
their teeth. Some waflabys or small rab
bits coming, the dingoes made after them <
and the woman pushed on, reaching the
hut of a man named O'Connor in a ter
rible plight.
The facts were reported to the police,
who ore searching the locality, but as
snow has since fallen little hope is en- j
tertained of their til-dins: the missing man
alive. i

The thrifty housekeeper finds many
uses for her favorite newspaper after she
has road the news, studied the bargain

wants for her serapbook. There is noth
ing so pood as newspapers, nol even cha

to Hie patent paper, which comes i"<>r th â 
purpose, they make the very besi carpel

be sure, for this <m- needs a good many,
as Beveral thicknesses are necessary.
If. when dirty work ts to be done, you
spread newspapers double on table m
floor \"u will save yourself no end of
cleaning and scrubbing. The poor man's
blanket is made of three thicknesses of
newspaper, joined together and basted be
tween cotton covers, like a quilt. It rus
tles a little, to be sure, but it is warm
and cheap. And four thicknesses of
newspaper, rut to tit the sole and worn
inside the shoe, makes an excellent sub
stitute for a felt insole, having: the double !
advantage that it takes up less room and
can bo put in fresh every day at abso
lutely no expense.
Nor is there any ice blanket equal to a

Ministers May Use Tobacc<
The "tobacco overture. sent down h>
the General Assembly was the feature
of general interest and discussion pre
sented before Monongahela Presbyterj
of the United Presbyterian Churcl
recently, at its session in the Eighth
United Presbyterian Church, Van Braarr
street, Rev. J. M. Wallace, D.D., pas

overture were voted upon separately
and many of the leading divines too*
an active part in the discussion All
except the clause forbidding the licen
sure and ordination of candidates foi
the ministry who use tobacco were de
feated by the heavy vote of about three
to forty-eight, while the one in ques
tion was defeated by four votes, there
being twenty-two yeas and twenty-six
?h PS ' A resolution w as then passed to
the effect that while the presbytery
had not voted in favor of the overture
it urged its candidates for tlfe ministry
and the officers of the church to re
frain from the use of tobacco. The ma
jority of the ministers, before voting
against the overture, wished to be dis
tinctly understood that while they con
sidered the use of tobacco an evil they
were opposed to placing a .'special fui

church government, as it would be'un
wise to legislate against every sin

the fir>t warnings of those troubles which
lead to consumption and death.
The hacking cough, spitting of blood,
weak lungs, and all similar troubles of the
organs of breathing, will surely lead to
consumption, if they are not already the
signs of it. Then there are the other mdi'-
' rations of the approach of consumption,
such as -â¢vats, emaciation, or wast-
ing away of flesh from bad nutrition, which,
if neglected, lead to certain death.
Ninety eight per cent, of all the cases of
weak lungs, bleeding lungs, lingering and
obstinate coughs, and other bronchial and
throat diseases, which" have been treated
with Dr. Pierre's Golden Medical Discov-
ery, have been cured by it. Do not wait
until your throat trouble becomes serious.
All bronchial and throat troubles arr seri-
ous. The time to take the "Golden Medi-
cal Discovery " is right at the start.
I Even if your throat trouble has been
neglected until it has been pronounced
pulmonary disease or consumption, do not
hesitate to use the "Golden Medical Dis-
covery." for thousands of letters from the
sufferers themselves, who are now well,
bear evidence that the "Golden Medical
Discovery" will cu/e. even after good phv-
Mcians have pronounced the disease pul-
monary consumption.

BOUND TO PASS
THE CANAL BILL
Emperor William Means
Business.
Cop>Tighted, "; r < r <. by the Associated rr*ss.
BERLIN, June 17.â The canal bill en
! gTossed attention this week and the
papers had much to say pro and con,
according to party standpoint. The
ultimate fate of the bill concerns Amer
; ica, as the construction of a network
:of canals joining the three largest
rivers In Prussia, the Kibe. Rhine and
Weser, and the far eastern provinces,
those bordering on the German Ocean,
will cheapen and facilitate the freights
of American exports, notably cereals,
meats, cotton and other bulky goods.
Another point interesting to America
is the fact that Prussian Agrarians and
those parties affiliating with them, the
Conservatives, Reichspartei and a por
tion of the Center, have made the bill
a test of strength between the Govern
ment and almost a personal contest be
tween them and the Emperor, who,
| with the entire Prussian Cabinet, is
pledged for the canal. His Majesty left
no doubt this week that he strongly
I wished the great canal to be built.
Tuesday he summoned the crown coun
cil for the purpose of agreeing with
the Cabinet on a line of action in the
Diet, and personally drew up a declara
tion, which -was read in the Diet on
Thursday, promising compensation to
; individuals and to provinces, especially
' Silesia, financially injured by the canal.
The passage of the bill through the
i lower house of the Diet will therefore
be a signal defeat for the Agrarians,
who are always the most hostile to the
American interests in Germany.
The liberal press stood united for the
; bill, and it is 'confidently expected the
canal will give a powerful impetus to
German industry, especially in the
highly developed Rhine and Westphal
ian districts and will create a more ex
j tended and more uniform market for
agricultural products.
The correspondent here of the Asso
ciated Press learns on high Government
authority that the acceptance of the
i bill by the lower house of the Diet does
not mean its adoption by the upper
house, where the Government expects
j determined opposition, as the Agrarian
Interests are usually predominant in
. that body. If. as is most likely, the
i majority of the upper house opposes the
( bill, the Emperor is determined to re
sort to the expedient of forcing its final
passage, which has not been tried in
Prussian politics for a generation. This
will be also called pairschub. The Em
peror, asking of Prussia, will create a
sufficient number of new peers to se
cure the desired majority.
The Emperor's intentions remain a I
secret, known to few of his intimates
| but they will he carried out in the
event of the contingency arising, as he
is determined to demonstrate that the
Agranians are not strong enough to de
feat important legislation required for
; the country's good.
It i.Â« reported that his Majesty is in
censed nt thfÂ» fact that the leading
Agranian organizations mid chiefs had
thÂ«> assurance i" state openly and
pointedly last wwk that tlipy meant to
make the bill prove tlu-ir political pre
dominance.
Immediately after Thursday's sitting
Prince Hohenlohe. thf imperial Chan
cellor, and I>r. Miquel, tho Prussian
Minister ><f Finance, visited the Em
peror, who insists on a dissolution if
the bill is rejected. Th- committee will
begin the discussion of the measure
June 2". The Centrists demand the
passage of tho municipal election bill
before action is takm on the canal bill.
The many claims for compensation
greatly complicate the situation.

DISPLEASURE OF
GERMANY'S PRESS
Comment on the Peace
Conference.
ghted, 1899, by th? Associated rrÂ»s?.
BERLIN. .Tune 17.â The recent devel
opments at the Peace Conference are
generally commented upon here and the
statements <>f the foreign papers, par
ticularly the Knglish. that the German
representatives at The Hagup are op
posed i" arbitration have been noted
with deep displeasure. Almost the en
tire press of Germany.glves indignant
voice i" what the papers t^rm "Eng
lish intrigues In order to prejudice tfie
world against Germany's pacific inten
t lons."
An important foreign official said to
the correspondent here of the Associ
ated Press:
"The Incomplete and usually dis
torted partisan reports of the doings of
our representatives at The Hagu*.
which havo appeared for weeks in the
foreign, notably the Plnglish and
French press, are calculated to create
false Impressions. It was on account
of this thai Count Munster proposed
that full reports of the transactions
from day to day he given out officially.
The fad th;it such a proposition was
made by Germany shows that we have
nothing to hide and have no fear of
correct and full reports.
"As regards England's proposal for
a permanent court of arbitration, this
goes beyond Russia's proposal. Aside
from that we miss several seemingly i
essential features, such as rules pro
viding for absolute impartiality. As
soon as guarantees of such impartiality
are given, Germany will be able to as-
Berfl to propositions going beyond thÂ»
scope of the original Russian proposi-
I Hon. Some method will probably bo
found to improve on the incomplete
and unfair reports <>f the meetings of
the conference new in vogue, if i yen
I complete reports are to bo printed in
the official organ of the German Gov
ernment."
This statement is borne out by the
utterances of the semi-official press.
The Merlin Post this week has a se
ries of editorials, bitterly commenting
>>ri the "false and malicious reports of
the English press regarding Germany's
attitude at The Hague," ami asks Iron
ically why if Great Britain wishes to
, found courts of arbitration she has not
] appealed to such a court in the Trans
vaal matter or in the Alaskan diffi
culty.
The Cologne Gazette expressed th.->
belief that the whole conference will
"soon end in smoke."
This view is supported by a score of
other inlluential pa- ers. The National
Zeitung said it hoped the Government
would soon establish a method of regu
lar and reliable daily reports of the
doings of the conference.
The snub administered to Germany
by rejecting her Ministers proposition
at The Hague has been bitterly com
mented on by the press here. The
i Deutsche Zeitung remarks: "This
treatment of a big power like Germany
strikes me as wholly Inappropriate.
We hope the Government will find a
I fit answer to this lack of courtesy."
The Berlin Tag^hlatt. however, says:
I "If the report iB correct, we must as
sume that Dr. Zorn misunderstood his
instructions/"

Special Cable to The Call and the New York

LONDON, June 17.â "The cur.- of mala
ria or any other fever In one night Is ab
surd. The man is an Igribramus. li is
Impossible and quite contrary t.> all the
laws of nature or of sense."
hi these very words and other similar
terms urn' the replies ;i Herald corre
spondent got to-day from several eminent
. London doctors whom he called upon and
Interviewed with reference to ihr- n< w
curt' for malaria which I>r. J. Gordon
Bennett Â»f Halifax claims to have discov
â¢ red, ;is reported in a special cable dis
patch in Thursday's tii ralfl.
On reading I >r. J. Gordon Bennett's in
terview, â â !'! seven doctors who were seen
simply laughed, with only two < xceptions.
Tiny made the same stipulation as they
did on former occasions when I inter
viewed ili>'in on other subjects for the
Herald. Thai was thai their names
should noC 'Â»â¢ attached in any statments
thej made.
It wasn't thai they feared expressing
any opinion, but tlwre'seema to be some
sort of professional etiquette which pre
vents them from lending their names tn
< ritlclsms in newspapers of other prac
titioners' views and methods.
One eminent doctor, living on Wimpole
street, who has always been mosi oblig
ing in giving the Herald his views on
matters of public interest, w gentleman
who is closely connected with fever hos
pitals, and an old experienced practi
tioner, spoke his mind very freely. The
value of his utterances may be Judged
from the fact that lie is a fever special
ist and has long been connected with f> -
ver hospitals. He has had passed thou
sands of fever cases of all kinds through
liis hands, and has. moreover, at the pres
ent lime, under treatment a number of
soldu rs invalided home to Bnglai '1 from

â  nee to cream can be irtfused into skimmed
milk, and even milk that i- comparatively -our can

d colorings." a Bo ton paper says
re men who carry on a large business in deal
ing in them, and adds: "A circular from a concern
engaged in the business gives the names and prices of
different â  â¢ [pounds intended to preserve milk from
souring; to enhance the color of butter: to make
cider '.-park it- like champagne." and to embellish va
other articles of diet. Compounds are recom
mended that are said to 'keep milk and cream per
fectly sweet and fresh for any desired length fjf time.'
There are powders warranted that 'will give a deli
-1 other- that impart a 'natural, rich.
creamy shade in milk and buttermilk.' One of the
artists is so 'enthused' over the success of his trans
formations as to declare that 'Nature is no longer in
ame-.'
A milk association that will work for the protec
tion of iionc-t dairymen against the competition of
dishonest dealers in such stuff as that brought to
light in Boston will undoubtedly be of great benefit
to San Francisco, and since it appears likely that
some combine will be formed it is to be Imped it will
be of that kind.

PROTEST OF BUNKER HILL.
Til!", battle of Bunker Hill was not fought on the
eminence of that name, which rises one hun
dred and ten feet above the sea level, but on a
lower spot known as Breeds Hill, in the immediate
vicinity. There Colonel Prescott. with fifteen hun
dred patriots, confronted the British troops and with
stood the British bombardment, and. although tech
nical victory was with the enemy, they retired in per
fect order, after having baptized a continent by the;
rites oi constitutional liberty and sounded a blast for j
humanity that has since reverberated throughout the j
world. The Mystic River, flowing into Boston har
bor and blending with the surging Atlantic, was an
apt simile of the stream of popular sovereignty that,
since June 17. 1775. has poured from Bunker Hill into
the arid deserts of monarchy and imperialism. The
commemorative obelisk, *2\ feet in height, over !
which from base to summit the magnificent eloquence
of Daniel Webster spread its consecrated patriotism.
i â¢ tin. perpetual sentinel of a Continental Republic. 1
with its banner of liberty, across the broad expanse
between two mighty oceans, waving in solar glory or |
resting under the -till majesty of the night.
It is hard to comprehend how an imperialist, an
Asiatic annexationist, a convert to Roman or British
colonization, or an American speculator or plutocrat,
drenched with mercenary turgidity, can think of Bun
ker Hill without a blush, or, at its recurring anni
versary, .successfully resist its regenerating and trans
figuring influence: On that day the rising sun flood
ed the cradle of American freedom, and with its ex- j
piring rays it seemed that, on this hemisphere, dcs- j
potism had sunk into eternal darkness. Through
humble colonists, the ragged Continentals, manhood
had burst the cerements of the ages and stood upon
it< feet in all the splendor of resurrection. ,\ spon
taneous impulse, perhaps more accurately a providen- 1
tial suggestion, precipitated a revolution that never !
receded until our Constitutional Republic was firmly i
â¢ stablished. The blow struck for liberty was followed
by the Declaration of Independence, by the bloody
struggle with King George, by the Articles of Con- |
it-deration, by the Federal Constitution, by the ab
sorption of the Northwestern Territory, by natural
and legitimate extension from the Gulf of Mexico j
and the Colorado to the Arctic, by the supreme test;
of the Civil War. by development in population, |
111 wealth, in power and in influence, that almost
satiated the optimists of the globe.
It i> this history that the reactionists, the revolu
tionists, the gold worshiper-, would obliterate or re
verse in the titanic contest of 1850. when the Ex
pounder of the Constitution, surrounded by states
men and patriot-, was facing sectionalism and slowly
drawing California into the Union, he said: "We j
have a great, popuiar, constitutional Government,
guarded by law and judicature, and defended by the'
affections of the whole people. No monarchical]
throne presses these State- together, no iron chain i
of military power encircle- them. They live and
stand under a Government popular in its form, rep-'
resentative in its character, founded upon principle* 1
quality, and so constructed, we hope, as to last j
forever. In all its history it has been bene
ficent: it has trodden down no man's liberty, it
has crushed no State." This was the same noble
American who. twenty years earlier, with his heart:
turned toward Bunker Hill and the beginning of
American history, had stood for "Liberty and
Union," and had proclaimed that where the Ameri
can republic was born the might of patriotism
would be exerted to save it. and that it would fall at
last, "if fall it must, amidst the profoundest monu
ments of it- own glory and on the very spot of its
< rigin."
And when our first martyred President assumed
!:i- official station and inaugurated his own immor
tality he proudly asked: "Is it true, then, that any
right, plainly written in the constitution, has been
denied?" * * * "Think, if you can, of a single
instance, in which a plainly written provision of the
constitution has ever been denied."
Bunker Hill has been appropriately celebrated in
;;-'Â»') We hope its meaning and it< protest may be
accepted and enforced at home, if for the moment
rded in tuba and the Philippines.
HENDERSON'S ELIGIBILITY.
Till" opposition to Henderson for the Speaker
ship continues to rally around the idea that his
Scotch, birth excludes him from that office be
cause the law of i7<)_>. repealed in 1886. put the Presi
dential succession in the legislative branch of the
Government by selecting the President pro tempore
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House.
The constitution, as we have shown, gives Con
gress the power to designate the officer of the Gov
ernment who shall succeed to the Presidency in the
event of disability of the President and Vice Presi
dent. The act of 1702 was passed to conform thereto.
it might as well have sent the succession to the Chief
Justice, or the senior Senator or Representative, or to
the chairman of the Way- and Mean- Committee of
the House, or the chairman of the Finance Commit
tee of the Senate,. Either course would have been in
perfect conformity to the constitution. The Bulletin
;- arguing that the succession can go only to such
"officers" as arc named in the constitution, and that.
therefore, the law of 1886 is invalid because it sends
it to the Cabinet officers in the order of their se
niority! and these are not specifically named in the
constitution. But the instrument says that the houses
i of Congress shall elect a Speaker, President pro tem
pore "and other officers." These are sergeant at
arms; clerk, etc.. and. therefore, according to the Bul
letin, the Presidential succession could be conferred
1141011 the sergeant at arms or the clerk of either
Hotlse, but not upon the members of the Cabinet, be
cause the former arc included among the "officers"
authorized by the constitution. The law of 1886 is
â  spoken of as if it were already under fire in a case
pending before the courts and about to be decided
adversely to its validity.
But there is no such case, nor can there be unless
the situation arises for which the law provides and
the Secretary of State were about to take the office
of President. It is quite likely that even then no way
I cculd be found in which to bring such an issue to bar.
A writ would have to issue from a Federal court. All
, such writs mu>t run in the name of the President of
the United States: therefore the- executive would
be in the position of issuing a writ against himself to
1 test his right to apply for the writ at all.
That the law of 1886 was constitutional was not
doubted by the Congress which passed it. In that
Congress were Edmunds. Carlisle, Hoar, and other
leaders of the American bar of both parties, and they
all concurred in its support.
Not only on constitutional grounds is the law right,
hut it is justified on tho^e of propriety and expe
diency. The purpose of the constitution is to keep
tiir three co-ordinate branches o? the Government as
distinct from each other as possible. The House has
infrequent occasion to influence the choice of the
' executive, arising only when there is a failure of
oh"i( c by the Electoral Colleges. The Senate takes
ii a part in the executive function only when ratify-
i ng treaties and confirming appointments, and in the
xxiJUi L-xia.l i M.I'.TJI.JL'I V^'.l.k.'JV-'V^ V-fIJJJJ, OU1'Â« J-'-CI.X, U Ul^l-Li 10, J.0Â«7*7Â»
judicial function when sitting as a court of impeach
ment. The President participates in legislation only
when using the veto. To pass the Presidential suc
cession to the President pro tempore of the Senate
and Speaker of the House was to invite intrigue for
the vacation of the office that it might fall to the legis
lative branch. It is no secret that the attempt to
impeach Andrew Johnson arose in just such an in
trigue. Ben Wade was President pro tempore of the
Senate. A cabal formed to oust Johnson, make Wade
President and profoundly change the future course of
political events. It would have succeeded except for
the clear judicial judgment of Fessenden and Grimes.
With the succession to the executive placed definitely
in the executive branch of the Government, the in
dependence of that branch is preserved and the three
co-ordinate branches of the Federal government are
kept as distinct as the constitution intended.
The Bulletin falls into a strange error about
Speaker Crisp, who was born in England, by saying
that his parents were there in the service of this Gov
ernment. His parents were actors and were fre
quently abroad playing long engagements, for they
were artists of merit. During one of these sojourns
the future Speaker was born. His par:nts were fa
vorites in Boston and lived there a great deal, filling
professional engagements. On such occasions they
lived with the parents of Congressman Loud of this
city, and he and the future Speaker were friends in
boyhood. Their early relations were the cause of the
marked favor shown Mr. Loud by Crisp when in the
chair.
To conclude the issue of Henderson's eligibility, it
is as undoubted as is his right to a seat in the House.
BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER.
AFTER consideration sufficiently long to allow
time for clue attention to every issue involved,
the Regents of the University of California
have elected Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Cornell to
succeed Martin Kellogg in the presidency. The
choice will doubtless give well nigh universal satis
faction to all who are interested in the welfare cf the
institution, and the new president will find cordial
support and co-operation in the work that awaits
him.
While it would have been pleasing in many respects
to have had a native Californian. or one long iden
tified with the State, chosen to preside over the uni
versity at this juncture, when it is about to enter upon
r new epoch in its development, still it has been
everywhere recognized that true State patriotism
would be shown not so much by electing a local edu
cator because of local esteem as in choosing the man
who is best fitted for the position and can render
best service to the State, and that i* what the Regents
have aimed to accomplish.
There is urgent need at this time for a man of ex
ceptional powers at the head of the State University.
The institution occupies the peculiar position of hav
ing a financial embarrassment at present with the
most golden and splendid prospects in the immediate
future. It therefore requires for its proper manage
ment a President who can deal with equal wisdom
with the two diverse problems of existing neecis and
prospective expansion, as well as give a new stimulus
tc it* educational work and extend its intellectual in
fluence.
Abundant reasons exist for believing the Regents
have found such a man as the occasion requires. Pro
fessor Wheeler, while comparatively young, has at
tained a national reputation for eminence in univer
sity work. He is reputed to be a many sided man.
with sympathies for all the issues of university life,
from scholarship to athletics. He comes to us with
recommendations that give assurance that our most
sanguine expectations of an ideal president for the
new era of California University will be fulfilled, and
accordingly there will be a general congratulation
throughout the State over the choice made by the
Regents, and a warm welcome when he arrives to
enter upon his labors.
CONGRATULATIONS TO SAN DIEGO.
WITH this issue of the paper Mr. James Mac-
Mullen resigns the responsibilities of the office
of managing editor of The Call to accept con
trol ami management of the San Diego Union.
While the change is one that advances Mr. MacMullen
to a position which he prefers, and is therefore in the
nature of a promotion, the chief beneficiaries of the
loss to The Call will be the paper which obtains his
services and the city to whose welfare that paper is
devoted. To San Diego and to the San Diego
Union, therefore, the congratulations of the occasion
jire due.
Mr. MacMullen has been on the staff of The Call
(or upward of eleven years of continuous service.
Beginning his work on the paper as a reporter, he
soon demonstrated a marked capacity for mastering
every duty intrusted to him. and rose rapidly in the
esteem of his colleagues and his employers. Pro
moted to the desk of city editor, he filled that posi
tion with such success that when The Call passed
under the control of the present management he was
assigned to the office of managing editor, and in that
field even more than in the former ones demonstrated
his wide knowledge of practical journalism and his
ability to direct and control men.
Rarely has any city editor or managing editor
maintained a better discipline in a newspaper office.
cr infused a staff of workers with more of harmony
and genuine enthusiasm in their work, than Mr.
MacMullen did while holding those positions on The
Call. He leaves with the regrets of all who have
worked with him. for there is not one who does not
feel a loss of something personal to himself in the re
tirement of a man who has been not only an inspir
ing managing editor but a genial companion and a
true friend.
The San Diego Union will find in its new manager
a well trained journalist of liberal education and wide
experience â an editor who knows news and how to
obtain and how to handle it. His service to the paper
will be valuable in many ways, and can be relied upon
to widely extend its usefulness and deepen its in
fluence. San Diego adds to her population a citizen
of marked public spirit, of generous sympathy with
every movement that tends to the general good; one
who will in his new office be largely instrumental in
advancing every interest of the community. To the
Union and to San Diego The Call extends congratu
lations.
Chief of Police Devery of New York swears that he

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGHT.
The word. "June," printed conspicu
ously at the head of the calendars, re
ports of sweltering heats coming to us
from all points outside the city, a cer
tain haziness in the atmosphere, the
radiant diaphanous garmentin^s of the
girls upon the streets, two ripples of
earthquake and several severe shocks
of suicide, are evidences that summer
time has come â the season that wilts
the collars and tries the souls of men â
the period of the year when some mor
tals throw aside their clothes for a
plunge into the sea; and others throw
their bodies off for a dive into the in
finite.
All authorities on the subject agree
that suicide is more likely to occur in
summer than in winter, in the daytime
than in the night, on sunny days than
in gloomy weather; is more frequently
resorted to by healthy people than by
the sick, by the young than by the old,
by the educated than by the ignorant,
and by people who are comparatively
well to do than by those who suffer the
wretchedness of absolute poverty.
Arguing: from statistics, therefore,
Mr. Tennyson should have written, "In
the spring a young man's fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of suicide." Man can
turn to thinking of love in January as
well as in June, but he cannot think
so easily of self-destruction. When the
atmosphere of the earth is disagreea
ble one does not feel like stripping off
his Hesh and trusting his naked soul to
the inclemencies of the infinite. Any
body at any time can tumble into love,
but one must have youth and beauty
and vigor of some kind, and the sea
son must be gay and bright and warm
when desire comes to knock at death's
door to ask for a place to sleep.
There is a sort of nlekel-in-the-slot
philosophy which accounts for suicide
on the grounds of insanity or coward
ice; and it is as common as the slot
machines and just about as valuable.
It is easy to say no sane person nor any
courageous person ever committed self
destruction, but the saying doesn't ac
cord with the facts.
The race that in all history is most
noted for breeding men with sane
minds in sane bodiesâ men conspicuous
above all others for physical hardihood
and moral strength â was that of old
Rome; and that race produced more
illustrious and a larger number of illus
trious suicides than any other. Their
philosophy encouraged it, and it was a
proverb among them, "He who com
plains of the ills of life is a fool, for he
may die when he chooses."
Of course suicide will never be to the
modern world what it was to the an
cient. It is one of the few paganisms
which the devotees of Mrs. Grundy and
the votaries of Bohemta unite in de
nouncing with severity and with wit.
and' which is therefore condemned in
the name of society and in thf name of
good fellowship as a violation of re
ligion, a breach of etiquette and a sign
of a lack of humor.
By reason of this well nigh universal
objection, suicide has ceased to be
practiced by statesmen, society leaders,
public lecturers, wits, authors or others
who desire popular favor. It does not
follow, however, that those who do
take it up as a last resort are any more
unworthy of the love <>f the masses
than a good many of those who would
never think of doing anything so
shocking to popular sensibilities and
so false to the teaching of < >ninr Khay
yam.
â¢ * *
If we accept the showing of the re
cords and do not go behind the re
turns, there are as many reasons for
suicide as for matrimony. In some In
stances, Indeed, the very motive which
prompts one person to marry prompts
another to get in all haste to the realm
where there is neither marriage nor
giving in marriage.
Some folks kill themselves in June
because of things for whirh they would
not give 30 cents in March. Two girls.
young and joyous, attempted suicide in
this city, and one of them succeeded,
because a young man broke a promise
to take them to Denver. A dispatch
from New York reports that a woman
killed herself in that city last Sunday
because she found it "too hot to live."
A woman in this city lived as long as
she was able to believe her lover worth
dying for, but as soon as she found he
was not worth it she killed herself for
him.
Clearly Matthew Arnold was wrong
in saying the chief defect of- the race is
"a bloodthirsty clinging to life." A con
siderable number' do not cling to it with
even a beer thirst. Not more readily
do prunes drop from the trees in year?
when prunes bring good prices than do
some persons drop from life; and no
sooner does there come a clear, warm
day, when the heavens look enticing,
than they turn loose of earth and let
their souls drop down the abysses of
space without even taking the trouble
to look where they are going to light.
Â» * *
Every one who meditates suicide
feels along with the impulse to self
destruction an equally strong impulse
to give a reason for it. Thus the art
so far from being irrational is perhaps
more conducive to reasoning than any
other within the power of man. Few
people, even when under the influence
of love or liquor, undertake it without
giving to it the most serious thought of
which they Hre capable; and it is hard
ly an exaggeration to say that every
intelligent man or woman in the world
has at times earnestly considered it as
a solution of the harassing problems of
life.
Many are the actions by which hu
manity manifest's its superiority to the
brute creatures who nourish a blind
Hfe within the brain, but. as has been
many times pointed out, the powers
which most strikingly evince that su
periority are those that enable the hu
man to eat when he is not hungry,
drink when he is not thirsty, make love
when not in love and die when he foels
like it. In each of such actions there
is a distinct triumph of mind over mat
ter, of the spirit orer the flesh, a sub
ordination of the body to the desires of
the soul.
Some philosophers maintain that
thought is a disease of the brain; that
every interference of the intellect with
the processes of the physical being is
an insane proceeding. According to
that philosophy, it is an act of insanity
for the brain to compel the body to die
when the body desires to. dance; but
by the same argument it is also insane
for the brain to compel the body to
drink a gallon of beer when being al
ready swollen with liquid it longs for a
salt herring; or to gorge itself with a
French dinner when it desires nojhing
but a ham sandwich. Thus if suicide
be insanity, so also is high life insan
ity: and the only sane member of the
human family is the ourang outang.
When aspirins suicides undertake to
give reasons for their aspiration they
make a most fantastic mockery of di
vine philosophy, for not one person in
a million and a half can exnlain the
motive of even the simplest actions of
his life. Hence every act of self
destruction is accompanied by some
thing in the nature of a comedy and
causes the face of the world to assume
the grotesque expression of a grinning
mouth underneath weeping eyes.
A tender hearted woman in this city
in giving way to the promptings of the
June came to the conclusion she was
dying for a man, and left behind her a
verse declaring:
You I loved since first we met,
You 1 loved and love you yet.
You may hate, but I will never
Till heaven and earth shall bump together.
About the time that verse so pathetic
in its simplicity was in process of com
position a man who had resolved to
get off the earth set about rinding an
explanation for his action and, manlike,
took to philosophy instead of poetry, as
the ladies do. He wrote:
"When the philosophy of the human
family has been learned and women re
fuse to inspire a feeling of a masculine
heart, a man will think this: Woman's
object in life is to play a man for a
fool, and she never will leave him till
she finds a bigger fool."
Thus it is shown that in this act, as
in all others, the woman blames the
man and the man blames the woman;
and each finds in the other a helpmeet
and a resource to account for all short
comings. Surely it would be a sad
world indeed if men and women did not
have one another to rely upon in time
of trial.
. '.'.: â¢ * *
The reasons assigned ' for their ac
tions by persons who are about to re
move themselves out of reach of trou
ble have no value at all. except as illus
trations of the truth that when people
give you nine reasons why they per
form a certain act, you may be sure
there is a tenth reasonâ not givenâ
which is the dominant" one of the lot.
Fortunately the subject has been stu
died by great men and their views are
more instructive than those of the
small fry.
In explaining the motives of Werther
and the causes which induced that
youth to close his bright career, Goethe
attributes self-destruction in every case
to a sheer weariness of life caused by
the failure <>f repeated efforts to enjoy
it. Victor Hugo regarded it as the out
come of an Incessant meditation upon
the conditions of existence. "When a
man goes out every morning," says
Hugo, "to meditate upon life, he will
go out some evening and fling himself
into the river." Giacomo Leopard! con
sidered it the result of "a desire for hap
piness, not satisfied with pleasure," out
of which there comes a conviction that,
"life has not one sole fruit, but use
less misery all."
"All satisfaction in life." said Goethe, I
"is based upon the regular recurrence
of outward things. The alterations of
day and night, the seasons of the year, |
of flowers and fruits, and of whatever '
else returns from time to time, which j
we can and ought to enjoy; these are â 
the proper impelling powers of earthly (
life. The more open we are to those
pleasures, the happier we are; but if
the variety of these things appear be
fore us without nur participating in it,
then there comes upon us the greatest
evil and the heaviest disease, and we i
regard life as a disgusting burden. The
thought at least of suicide becomes
then inevitable."
If these opinions on the subject are
not convincing, they have at any rate
a moral common to them all and are
therefore instructive. They teach the
three maxims: Be content with pleas
ure, do not think too much and keep in
the swim.
Among the factors that tend to wear
iness of life is- the unendurable mourn
fulness of nature, for never was the
human soul ever quite so sad as the
world around it. It is not for nothing:
we talk of the wailing of the winds,
the moaning of the seas, the sighing*of
leaves and the dirges of the forests.
Animate nature may be gay enough at
times with its variety of fighting, feed
ing, frolicking and mating, but inani
mate nature appears to be always for
lorn. Even the infinite heaven seems
to have a yearning for some'hing it
cannot attain, or hasn't attained as
yet; and doubtless could we but hear,
it would be found the very music of the
spheres is sot in a minor key.
A disputant in one of the "Philo
sophical Dialogues" of Ernest Renan
attributes the mournfulness of nature
to an incessant yearning to evolve a
God. Nature, according to that specu^
lative philosopher, feels through her
universal frame the need of an intelli
gence that is at once omnipotent and
benevolent, and is forever trying to
give birth to him. Every force that
governs matter, from that which on
this earth has caused the worm to
mount through countless spirals up
ward to the dignity of man, to that
which moves jn the throbbing and the
panting of the stars, tends each in its
way to accomplish nature's vast de
sire.
Such a philosophy is just as helpful
as another in explaining the unexplain
able. and is more cheerful than most,
inasmuch as it gives a premise of the
coming of a time when life in the
United States and in the Universe gen
erally will be so much better ordered
than at present that no one will ever
Ret weary of life or anything in it from
love to politics, and suicide wili cease
with the tired feeling.
The final word of sane genius upon
suicide was uttered by Tennyson is
"The Two Voices":
'Tis life whereof our nerves are scan';
O life, not death, for which we pant;
More, life and fuller that I want.
That statement expresses as near the
whole truth as we can attain tn this
world upon the subject of self-destruc
tion. Those in whose nerves lire in
scant kill themselves in the expecta
tion of KettinÃ a better supply in a
new deal. That being so, the best ar
gument against suicide is to be found
in the old saying, "life is short, but we
shall be a long time dead." Conceding
all the superiority that can be claimed
for the spirit world over this planet,
the fact remains that we shall hay*
ample time to enjoy it when we get to
it; but once we leave here, we come not
again. So long therefore as one has a
stake on the table of life, it j s
best to stay with it and play t
out. There is no telling what
may come on the next turn 0 Â£ tk
wheel.

LANDING A STOWAWAY.
PKOri^E who try to "bent their way" by steamer will give the State of California a wide berth in future. That
vessel sailed for Portland early yesterday with a hig crowd of passengers. It took the purser arid chief steward a
long time to make the rounds, and the State was abreast Fort Point before the search for people without money
and without a ticket was completed.
One such man was found and brought before Captain Goodall. The latter did not waste any time, but ran the
steamer In toward the Marin shore. When near Point Diablo the State was stopped and a boat lowered. The stowaway
was put in the boat and rowed to the beach. It was impossible to get close enough to land the unfortunate fellow, so
he had to get into water up to his waist and walk ashore. When last seen by John Hyslop. the Merchants' Exchange
lookout at Point Lobos. he was climbing the Marin hills in the direction of Sausalito, with his bundle under his arm.
After getting rid of the stowaway the State of California stood on her course.

The latter felt a sudden tug at his
pocket and caught Abermath Just as he
was about to escape. Officer Caples was
standing a few feet away, and In less than
a minute had his ha ml on Abermath. The
prisoner made a desperate effort to es
cape, but officer Caples managed to get

The Federation of Mission Improvemfnt
Clubs held an interesting meeting hast
night in Andersons Hall at 70S Douglass
street. Resolutions of an important char
acter were adopted alter some warm de
bates. A resolution deprecating the in
tended action of some citizens to test the
validity of the primary law In court with
a view to having it declared unconstitu
tional was unanimously adopted. It was
urged that the primary law be given a
trial as a reform measure. Another reso
lution was adopted indorsing the recom
mendation of the Street Committee of the
Board of Supervisors in recommending
the granting of the corkscrew and Rail
road avenue franchise to the Market
street Railway Company. The Fourth of
July committee reported it had secured
Gle'rr Park for an evening celebration and
that a literary and musical programme
would be arranged for the evening and
ihat a dance and fireworks display would
be features of the occasion.
The petition signed by 1000 residents of
South San Francisco, which is to be pre
sented to Mr. Vining on Monday, because
<Â»f the poor service accorded them by the
Third and Kentucky streets line was also
indorsed. According to the petition, the
cars on that line stop at Twenty-third
stri-et instead of continuing through to
South San Francisco. By reason of this
lax service the residents of that district

SHERIFF MARTIN EXPLAINS.
He States That Secretary Kevane Is
Laboring Under a Grave Mis
apprehension.
Sheriff Henry Martin is rather annoyed
at the statements published in the papers
to the effect that his bills for the trans
portation of insane patients have been cut
fully $1200 by th:- State Board of Exam
iners. Mr. Martin states emphatically
that his bills were not reduced to that ex
tent, and he says that the publications
were due to a misrepresentation of facts.
"We cannot expect a deputy to walk
from the City Hall to the ferry or the
County J;iil when he is escorting an in
sane patient. Secretary Kevane's charge
that the deputies are allowed $1 for meals
Is incorrect. When a female insane
patient Is being conducted to the asylum
a matron must Accompany her. as pre
scribed by the regulations of the Slate
Lunacy Commission. The meals for tho
deputy and the matron cost $1. He does
not seem to appreciate this fact, and
therefore declares that the charge is ex
travagant. It is true some reductions
were made, but they were for trivial ex
penditures, such as carfare, carriage hire
! and meals. In some cases more than one
: deputy is sent with insane patients.
I but this precaution iÂ« never taken unless
suggested by the committing magistrate,
who afterward signs the claims."

STEADY FUNERAL-GOING.
Mourning and Graveyard Picnicking
Occupied Her Life for Years.
For y ars there lived on the west
| side a little woman with bright, sharp
1 eyes and an expressive face. Her step
: was slow and her shoulders bent, fur
I she was long past the beauty of youth
â¢â  and the glory of middle-a&ed woman-
I hood. Her small crepe bonnet was
; placed on perfectly arranged hair. Her
; black go\.n was trimmed with bands
; of crepe and she always v. a soft.
; black shawl thrown loosely over her
! shoulders. She was never seen alone.
[ but always with her was a we â¢ girl.
I who called her 'â¢grandma."
Few knew who the woman was or
who was the child or where they lived,
but both were known to all the promi
nent ministers on the west side, as well
as to the undertakers and funeral di
rectors. For years there was
not a prominent funeral in that
| end of town but the little
I woman and her grandchild were
lin attendance. If there was really
no choice in funerals they attended the
one where their favonte minister
i prayed. But no matter who the dead
I had been or who the minister was in
; charge or what the weather, the little
j woman and the child went to a fu
j neral every day. Some west side
preachers say they did not preach a
funeral service in years without first
shaking hands with the little woman
and her erandchild, for they were al
ways present. Some of the choir boys
learned to know them and to speak to
them, and some of the funeral directors
grew so accustomed to their presence
at services for the dead that they in
variably reserved two seats in a car
riage for them to ride out to the ceme
tery. Arriving at the cemetery, the
woman and child would wander off
hand In hand to some place near by,
and, seated on a grave, would unwrap
a package of lur. -neon, which they
would spread over the grave picnic
fashion. When the carriage drew up
for the mourners to return the little
woman and the child would minele
with the rest and return to the city.
That was all; no display of grief, no
comments, but alway: that dignified
silence and constant attendance. Some
people tried to learn .hy they went
to funerals and who they were, but
they never seemed to comprehend that
there was anything unusual or mys
terious in their manner, so no one ever
found out.
i.wo weeks or so ago there was a
lar"-e funeral on the west side that
neither the woman nor the child at
tended. The minister missed them and
thought there must be a large funeral
somewhere else. The funeral directors
reserV p<l the seats in the carriages, but
the woman and child did no' come to
occupy them. The church janitor
saved for the child a rose that had
fallen from the casket, "nu' she wag
not to be found. Nor was she seen
until las Wednesday. She entered the
church alone. Her dark frock had a
f r^sh band of crepe and she wore a
new feather and a flower in her hat.
Her rosy face looked thin and her eves
were ui.asually dark and brilliant. The
minister s as he shook hands with
her: "Where is your grandmother, my
dear?"
For a moment the child was silent.
Then she broke into a * rent of ween
ing. "Grandma's dead." she cried. "She
died the night we got h> le from the
last funeral."â Chicago Chronicle.

Oakland got its tally in the seventh. Up
to that tin â¢ there had not been a sign of
a hit off Fitz, but with one out Johnson
ripped off a double to center. Hardle's
out at first put him on third, and Moski
man shut for two bases, scoring Johnson.

Manager Struve surrendered his baseball
franchise, and the management of the
WatSonvMe Baseball Club to an associa
tion of the leading citizens of this city.

The change in management meets with
the approval of the baseball public and
the players.
The Sugarbeets fell to-day before Mc-
Graw's Prune-pickers In the most hotly
contested and brilliant game ever played
here. San Jose scored In the sixth, Wat
sonville in the seventh and twelfth, and
San Jose twice In the last half of the
twelfth; Although Harper pitched a won
derful game; he seemea to lose control in
the twelfth and was touched up severely.
Andrews was finished and Borchers was
to have taken his place in the next Inning.
McCarthy made the star play of the game
in the sixth, when he made a long run
and i itch near left ii. Id territory and pot
the ball to Belna with an assist by Harp
er, in time to put out Graham, who was
trying to get back to tlrst. The same
teams play to-morrow, with VVhelan and

GREYHOUND RUNS
WHILE HIS LIFE
BLOOD EBBS AWAY
Unusual Accident at
Union Park.
MOSE FALLS ON THE FIELD
SPIRITED COURSING IN RUN
DOWN OF TWO STAKES.
Extensive Preparations to Accommo
date a Great Throng To-Day,
Wlien the Champion Stake
Will Be the Feature.
i An unusual accident in the coursing field
! occurred at Union Coursing Park yester
' day in the run-down of the Reserve stake.
I Along toward the close of the day's sport
Muse, a New Zealand bred dog, was sent
i to the slips with Safeguard, John Maher's
black and white dog. Safeguard was un
sighted and ran about aimlessly until the
hare turned in his direction, when he
joined Mose in pursuit of their game.
Mosi was a strong- favorite in the bet
j tins, but, to the astonishment of his back
| ers, he gradually slowed down and stag
gered about until caught by his trainer.
He was found to 'have burst a blood
vessel, causing profuse hemorrhage. lie
was carried to his kennel, where every
thing possible was done to save his life.
; It was not thought he would survive,
owing to the loss of blood. The accident
is a rare one in coursing, but few in
â  stances of the kind being recalled by old
time leashmen.
The card was made up of the run-down
in the Pacific Derby stake for puppies and
also .the run-down of the Reserve stake.
! Over a third of the courses were won'by
shortendersâ Pastime, Ski, Said Pasha,
Candelarla and Snap Shot being among
them.

GUTTER AFTER RAUER.
He Wants the Collector Arrested on a
Charge of Robbery, but the
Warrant Not Yet Issued.
Max Gutter, real estate agent and
money lender, who had a scrap with fake
Raver, the collector, in the Sheriff's of
fice lit!- '.'. applied Cor a warrant in
Judge Treadwell's court yesterday for
the arrest of Raver on the charge of rob
bery. The Judge hesitated to sign t!io
warrant atid asked Gutter to bring his
witnesses â¢â â  1 ire him to-morrow.
li will be remembered that Raver went
to a fruit store at 1783 Haight street,
owned by Gutter, on June S. accompanied
by a man whom he represented as a dep
uty sheriff. Raver said he had an at
tachment against [.. Beni, a clerk" In the
! store, for $25, and alleged that Beni %â .â ;.-â 
the owner. He forcibly took $13 out of
the till and made Beni give him $12 out of
his pocket. Then ho gave Beni a receipt
I for the money.
Next day Gutter went to the Sheriff's
office and was told that an attachment
t had been levied on the store for $25, but
after it was ascertained that Gutter
owned the store the attachment was
withdrawn and no deputy sheriff was soiit
with Raver. Just then Raver came Into :
the â  iii'-. and he and Gutter had a fight. â¢

H"1 ' ng up a small lunch,
the yi ung â  acher hurried away

evil i ffects of ooffee
(that being the lesson for the day),
then â  . and made coffee the
principal thing for dinner. She had
been growing more and more nervous j
and irritable as the weeks passed by.
Stomach trouble had set in and more \
or less bowel trouble, but she never'
had applied to herself the teaching that
coffee acts as a poison on many sys-
tems.
A package : Postum Food Coffee j
found its way into th^ house and was
Bent down to Aunt Mllly, the cook, to

ek passed by and sh* became. \
Lnown as an enthusiast on th>- subjei I
â¢ b< hool a remark was made j
i looks, and she related
the story of the new coffee. Miss
Smith, one uf the teachers, remark-!
that she had always wanted something |
In P l *' â¢ and intended to try
It A few mornings afterward Miss
Smith remarked: ' v;.. tried your old :
Postum ai home, i nd nobody lined it." ;
She was Induced, however, to give it i
a trial under the personal direction of
her own supervision, In order to know
that it was boiled fifteen or twenty '
minutes. That cleared up the case, and
Miss Smith is as enthusiastic over Pos-
tum as the other teacher lias been.
The little nephew in the house was j
tly delighted with the thought of I
cup of coffee every morning
for breakfast The greatest victory we
have had is with sister, who has been
a regular coffee devotee and held out â 
;. gainst the Postum for some time; but
she. had used Postum for about
ten days, she said one morning: "I
must say I will take this in preference i
to coffee every time, bo we will just ,
have Postum hereafter and none of the
uld-fashioned coffee."
Xow when the teacher instructs a j

strate by her own physical health the
advantage of leaving off coffee with
its poisonous effects. Janet Cooper, j

PARIS CEMETERY FOR DOGS.
Decent Burial for Pets in Graves Sold
or Leased.
A s (ciety has lusl be< n founded In I';iris
eel is ihe en ation of a cemetery
igs M. Harmois, :h<- editor of ;i
popuhir magazine, is t ti â¢ - originator of the
t. The almost total absence In
Paris of the back garden makes It a diffi
cult matter to carry out a canine funeral
with anything approaching decency. The
more devoted owners of >! |i ks convey the
â  arcasses of their petn to the open ?
In the surrounding suburbs, with the re
sult that every now and then th<- papers
contain accounts of some bereaved person
. arrested bya local policeman mi the
charge of clandestinely burying a baby,
whereas all he had >i"n>- was to consign
his spaniel to its last resting place.
As a rule, of course, no such trouble is
taken, and the dog's hearse Is the dust
cart. A strong contingent of the departed
find their way to the Seine, out of which
river, In the course of its passage through
Paris. Home twenty thousand carcasses
are fished every year, the majority of
them those of dot*?. This watery burial
Is bad for the nectar we are "Â«ually asked
to ilrimc for a week or two in the height
of summer, and is an Ignominious end for
the animal-; who suffer It. Considerations
â â¢f this kind have Induced ML Harmois to
start his scheme. Up applied for help to
the Society Tor the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, but that body decided at its
la*l general meeting that its responsibili
ties ended with thf decease of its client?.
In reality the Bociety'a policy is one of
masterly Inactivity throughout, and It is
held in BUCh Blight esteem that one of its
mest distinguished members has publicly
asserted that on the only occasion on
which he ventured to Intervene in Its
name he was taken into custody for cre
ating a disturbance and stopping the
traffic.
However; M. Harmois has succeeded in
obtaining sufficient Bupport to start his
enterprise. The site uf his cemetery has
'â  already been selected on some waste
ground near the old fortifications, and
early In the coming year candidates for
admission will be afile to find accommoda
tion. The graves may be leased for as
â  many or as few years as the dog owner
. â  nslders to be the measure of his solici

Oldest School Teacher in Illinois.
< >mar H. Lincoln of Marengo. near Tlar
vard, 111., is the oldest schoolteacher in
point of years of service In the State. Mr.
Lincoln has been a country schoolteacher
In McHenry County thirty-six years. He
began his labors In the schoolroom at the
a|re of 19, and now. at the age of jB, is
instructing about twenty scholars in the
country school in his district.
Mr. Lincoln was born In the State of
New York fifty-six years ago. He came
to Illinois with his father when only four
> pars old. His education consists of such
advantages as he could th^n obtain In
the country schools and a short term in
the Wauconde Academy in Lake County.
During the thirty-six years of his pro
fessional career Mr. Lincoln has been em
ployed in but thirteen different scnools.
And he is apparently as energetic In the
performance of hia school duties to-day
an when he first began his work, and a
great deal more in sympathy with it. He
keeps himself up with the times In all
branches of pedagogy, and lsÂ« a liberal pat
ronlser of all publications in the educa
tional line ann one of the best posted
mm in the developments of our free
school system.â Chicago Chronicle.

to prosecute her If she would nay for
the umbrella, valued at $2 50. which she
did. The next day she returned and re

surprised person could recover himself
sufficiently to ask her business the wo
man calmly told him that she had been
pricing umbrellas In other stores, and
found she could purchase one like her
"\vn for $2, and she wanted to know if he
wouldn't refund her 50 cents. As a trih.

Submarine Canyons. Rivers and Val

[f England and France are not always
at one now, there was a time when they
were physically united, according to a
map shown by Professor Edward Hull at
the Royal Geographical Society, where he
read a paper yesterday on the "Sub-
Oceanic Features of the Coasi of Western
Europe." Among these features he de
scribed a deep canyon or river course in
the center of the English Channel, run
ning from the Straits of Dover westward
for a distanc< of seventy miles, known a.s
"Hurd's Deep," Commander Hurd having
discovered it while making BOUdings for
the admiralty. This gorge has a depth of
200 to r.i feet below the bed of the chan
nel. It was kept open by the force of the
waters of the English Channel as they
rose r>rd fell. Very curious features were
observed in the case Âf the Adour In
France. The ravine through which it
flowed at some ancient date was discover
able for a distance of sixty or seventy
miles from the coast, and about fifty
miles "lit it divided, forming, as it were,
an island !t<it*i feet down under the sea
level. At one time there must have been
some magnificent cascades in these
gorges, as the declines In their course
amounted to as much as a thousand feet
in a mile. Undoubtedly at one time the
land extended far out into what is now
the sea, and was several thousand feet
higher than it i 1 * to-day, but the action of
the water had worn the earth away. In
the Bny of Biscay, forty miles off Cape
Pieto, is a seastaek 200 fathoms below tno
surface of th>- sea. measuring on the land
side 4800 feet, and on the other side 7800

Burned a Precious Flag.
The late Janitor Peters of the Girls'
Grammar School in Gertnantown unwit
tingly destroyed a valued relic found In
the loft of the old building some tl'me prf
vious to his death. It was an Americiin
flag, the ilrst to float over a public school
building in this city, in 1863. It was
made by Mrs. John H. Dye, who was the
principal of the school during: the Civil
War. aided by other teachers of the
school. When it was proposed to pur
chase a flag not one could be bought,
therefore wide bunting was purchased
and cut In two. After the flag had been,
made and the stars sowed on by Miss
Rlghter. another teacher, the names of
the School Directors and teachers were
put on the stars. Mrs. Dye, In speaking
of the affair, said that the Janitor c H nie

its dilapidated condition, consigned it to
the flames.â Philadelphia Record.

The old dog blinks at the noonday sun.

And the morning; hours have seemed so
long,
For her thoughts are of the long ago.
When the old house rang with mirth
and song;
When the red-cheeked boys and merry

Came trooping in through the open door-
Some wander now 'neatli an alien sky.
An<! some will come back no moreâ no

There are empty chairs against the wall.

The day is sad. though the sunshine falls
Like sifted gold on the window sill;
And the dear old wife in her quiet way
Does the homely task she is wont to do-
But the tears fall fast as she sadly thinks

Filled with water, the jug is hung on a

CONVERSATION WITH SCHLEY
THAT CELEBRATED TURN MADE
BY THE BROOKLYN.
An Investigation Will Be Made by

Whole Santiago Naval
Battle Reviewed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 17. -
Official cognizance has been taken by
Secretary Long of the dispute between
Lieutenant Commander A. C. Hodgson,
navigator of the Brooklyn, and Lieuten
ant Commander L. C. Heilner. navigator
of the Texas, during the battle with Cer
vera's fleet, relative to the conversation
alleged to have occurred between Liou
tenani Hodgson and Hear Admiral Schley
in connection with the celebrated turn
made by the armored cruiser.
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson, after
having, it Is asserted, repeated the con
versation he had with Schley, denied that
it ever took place in a lejtter to the ad
miral, lieutenant Commander Heilner
declares that to prove the position of the
Brooklyn at the meeting of t/he board of
navigators appointed to locate the ships
during the battle he repeated the conver
sation in order to confirm the Brooklyn's
position as he claimed it to be.
I understand the Navy Department has
called upon these two officers for an offi
cial explanation of their statements, and
that each officer who was a member of
the Board of Navigators has heen re
quested to inform the department if Lieu
tenant Hodgson made such statements as
alleged. The navy regulations contain
provisions for the discipline of any officer
found guilty of untriithfulness. This Is*
the conversation which Lieutenant Com
mander Hodgson is credited as saying:
Schleyâ Hard a-port.
Hodgson You mean a-starboard.
Schleyâ No, I don't: we are near enough
to them (the Spaniards) already.
Hodgsonâ But we will cut down the
Texas.
Schleyâ Damn the Texas; let her look
i out for herself.
Secretary Long declined to pay this af
; ternoon whether any charge growing: out
of the difference in the statements made by
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson and
Lieutenant Commander Heilner had been
filed, but it is understood that none has
been filed against Lieutenant Commander
: Heilner at least. In any event the de
! part en determined that the matter was
| now a subject for its action. There is a
disposition in naval circles to believe that
! any court which may grow out of the
controversy will receive testimony on the
j events of the entire battle in order that
the world may know to whom the credit
belongs for the victory.

THE CITY ATTORNEY
GIVES HIS OPINIONS
TWO CLAIMS AGAINST BATE
MAN BROS.
There Is No Law to Compel Property
Owners to Pave Acepted
Streets.
City Attorney Lane has submitted to
the Board of Supervisors tils opinion in
the matter of the petition of the. Plastic
Fire Prooi Construction Company, which
sued the cit> for $5000 damages be
cause of the alleged use of Its ao-called
patent fire-proof material in the con
struction of tlit- doors, wiiils ;jnii ceilings
of th<- Hall of .lu>:ic-. Attorney l,anÂ«- ad
vises M^'ii'^i the compromising of thu suit
lor $3500, as the Bateman Brothers, con

Contract with the rltj :ikiv.-c] to gnar- '
jn tee Immunitj to the citj and count) of
Ban Francisco from BUita or damages re
â â¢ use of pat< i.t devices in |
the construction of t in- work. He also
advises thai the board withhold stu'li sum
from payment to the contractors until ;i
determination "f the present suit has been
j cached.
In the matter of the resolution from the
I- -.i.r.1 . setting forth the necessity of com-'
pelling v speedy completion <>f the work
on the Hall .if Justice, Attorney Lane
says that under tln> contract with the |
man Brothers, the architect is em- j
powered to employ sudi men is may be
i essarj to proceed with the work. This
is allowable under the agreement, which
specifies that if at an> time during the :
currencj oi the contract, the contractor
should not be making proper and reason
able progress with the work, or should be ;
unnecessarily delaying the same, the
architect shall liuv.- the powor to employ
men to do the w.'rk. Under th>- contract
tin Hall Justice was to have b>->-n com- j
pl'-t'-d on or before October 1. 18iÂ»7, but
this time was extended bj the Supervisors
until July i. Is9n. The "\m irk cannot be
completed t>> the latter date. Under the
contract the city may withhold from th<
contractors the sum of Jliio per day for
day after July 1, lKw*. during which j
the work shall remain uncompleted.
With reference to compelling a Bpeedy
< ompletion of street work on accepted
streets in tlje district lying to the ea.st
of Kearny street, the City Attorney says:
"As to the paving of the accepted
â  ets, it is suggested In your reso
lution :h.ii the city mid county pur
poses Imposing upon tho property
owners fronting on such streets one
half of the cost of repaying the same.
I know of no warrant in the law for
such a course. If property owners
lose to make such agreement with
city they ;m responsible therefor
am! cannot complain. But the city
cannot 'â¢.â¢m-," i such contribution, ft
:s the city's duty to keep accepted
streets open and In repair and to r.
pave when necessary. If the city docs
see Bl to perform this duty f know
'.; no means by which such action can

days for Indianapolis to urge the claims
of California, and our merchants should
leave no stone unturned to secure such
a convention tos this city. A big fight
will be made by other coast cities, but
San Francisco has demonstrated to the
world her ability to care for great con
ventions and should win this prize:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 15, 1899.
1 i~ar Sir At the Epworth League Biennial
International Convention, which is to be held
In the city of Indianapolis, InÂ«i., next month.
an effort will be made to secure the next meet
ing of this Kreat convention for San Francisco
In 1901 a committee of about fifteen will be
in attendance to urtre the claims of the Golden
State. The expenses for preliminary work and
a California exhibit will be met by the local
leagues of this city and Alameda County, but
It is essential to success that the committee
be in position to give assurance that the neces
sary expenses for the convention, amounting
to about $2f..'>">, shall be met by the business
community, Other cities competing have made
the necessary pledge. I>os Angeles is in the
race against Han Francisco, and back of Its
local committee are the Chamber of Commerce
and the business people generally. Denver is
in the same advantageous position. Our San
Francisco committee must be able to make a
showing of financial backing to secure the
prize. Â»
The coming of this body will mean m con
vention similar to the great Christian Endeavor
gathering of 1597, but In all probability much
larger.
It is expected that 30.G00 or more people will
be in attendance, and such a throng will cer
tainly be helpful to the best Interests of this
city. A committee will call upon you In a few
days for a conditional subscription to assist
in the enterprise, do part of which shall be
payable unless every condition Is met. Kindly
give our representatives an audience. Yours
very respectfully, C. H. PERKINS.

ABSCONDER FINDLEY
IS RUN TO EARTH
SAN LUIS OBISPO'S EX-TAX COL-
LECTOR HOME AGAIN.
He Was Tracked for Thousands ot
Miles by a Pinkerton Detective
and Taken in Peru.
Among the passengers on the train that
arrived from* the Easi early yesterday
morning were Samuel M. Flndley, the
absconding Treasurer of San Luis Obispo
County; John C. Fraser. one of Pinker
ton's shrewdest detectives, who had cap
tured the embezzler, and Thomas Berry.
auditor of the Fidelity Insurance Com
pany. After stopping an hour at the local
agency of the Pinkertons the trio de
parted on the southern train for San I.uls
< >Ms|>o. where Fintlley will be tried for
stealing the funds that a confiding people
had given Into his keeping. From all that
can bÂ« learned, his defalcation amounted
to about 115,000. Last November Flndley
disappeared, and an investigation showed
that he had taken with him the amount
stated in gold coin. Which direction he
had taken wits a mystery to his tuwns
people, and they were obliged to call upon
his bondsmm to make good the amount
stolen. The Fidelity company at once
secured the services of the Pinkertons and
C. E. Vannatto, the superintendent of the
Pacific department, soon found that the
fugitive hud gone to El Paso, Tex.
Mr. Fraser. superintendent of the. Den
ver department, was put on the trail, and
from that point he was led a merry chose
after the thief. Hack and forth through
Mexico be followed Flndley, who was
blazing his way through Innumerable
cities nnd towns by his lavish expenditure
of money. Sometimes he posed us a de
tective and at otfu-r times as a <'hicago
capitalist seeking an investment for his
spare ca.sh. but all the time he was work
ing his way to the south. In some places
he called himself Mlllt-n and sometimes
Muller, but for all his zigzagging and
aliases the detective kept on his trail.
From Appinwall Flndley made a break
to Peru, and a little later his pursuer was
soon in Lima. One day Ptuser, while sit
ting in a cafe, observed his man enter
and take a seat at a table near by. The
picture furnished the detective was true
to life, and It was an easy task in that
â strange land to get acquainted with the
man. Fraser assumed to be a mining
man. and together the two discussed
schemes by which they could make good
investments; but all the time Fraser took
good caxe to kill any plan that would have
caused Flndley to draw the $800(i from the
bank where he had deposited all that re
mained of his stealings soon after his
advent In Lima. Owing to there being no
extradition treaty between this country
and Peru Fraser was obliged to attach
the money and throw Flndley into jail
iijmn a trumped-up charge. When the
latter found that he could not get at the
money and that there wa.s little hope for
him To get out of Jail for a long time he
concluded to throw up the sponge and
come back with his captor.
The return trip was made by way of
New York and Denver. Flndley had but
little to say, except that during his trav
els he had enjoyed himself and for once
In his life knew the joys of spending
money. From his remarks he will plead
guilty and take such mercy as may be
bestowed upon him by the people he be
trayed, Mr. Berry's mission to the south
ern county Is to attend to the prosecution
of the prisoner. He states that the cap
ture of the fugitive has cost a great deal
of money, but his company does not take
that into consideration and Findley must
suffer a.s a warning to all others for whom
the company Is Purety. ,

On June 7 the Chinese called at Miss
LJebelt'a house for laundry. She accused
him of not bringing some towels and other
articles in the previous washing and they
had a dispute about it. The Chinese lost
his temper and struck Miss Llebelt in the
mouth and paid he would kill her. She
went upstairs and armed herself with a
revolver, and, returning, pointed It at the
Chinese remarking: "Now we will seÂ«
who kills first.' The Chinese grabbed the
bundle of clothing which he was to take
to wash and ran away. He has not been
back since. _

A NEW PREPARATION WHICH CURES
DYSPEPSIA AND STOMACH
. TROUBLE.
Remarkable Curative Properties.
A new remedy, which may revolution-
ize the treatment of stomach troubles,
has recently been placed before the pub-
lic and bears the Indorsement of many
leading physicians and scientific men.
The remedy is not a wonderful secret
discovery. nor a patent medicine, neither I
Is it claimed to cure anything except indi-
gestion and stomach troubles, with which i
nine-tenths of our nation are afflicted.
The remedy is in the form of pleasant
tasting tablets or lozenges containing veg-
etable and fruit essences, pure asceptlc
pepsin (free from animal Impurities), bis-
muth and Golden Heal; they are sold by
druggists general'y under the name of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Many Interesting experiments made
with these tablets show that they pos-
sess remarkable digestive power, one
grain of the active principle being suffi-
cient to thoroughly digest 3000 times Its
own weight of lean meat, eggs, oatmeal
or similar wholesome foods; these tab-
lets do not act on the bowels like after-
dinner pills, nor in fact do they act upon
any particular organ, but the manner in
which they cure all forms of indigestion
Is this: They act entirely upon the food
eaten, digesting It completely, nourishing
' every tissue and nerve in the body; they
' simply perform the work of digestion.
' thus giving the weak stomach rest and
â  assistance sufficient to enable It to re-
' cover Its normal strength. This is the
â  reason so many pretended cures lyive sig-
j nally failed; they do not furnish the diges-
] tive power which is the one thing above
j all others that the stomach of the dys-
I peptic lacks, and unless that lack Is sup-
! plied, it Is waste of time to attempt to
; restore the enfeebled stomach by means
of "tonics," "stomach bitters" and
"pills." No permanent good can result
j from their use.
If the stomach can be rested and as-
, sisted in the work of digestion it will very
soon recover: this Is the secret and the
1 whole secret of the remarkable success
j <'f Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
! practically unknown a year ago and now
! the must popular, widely used dyspepsia
remedy, everywhere a success secured al-
most entirely on its merits, as it has never
] been extensively advertised.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are now sold
! by druggists everywhere at 50 cts. per
j package; if he hasn't them In stock he
will order them for you from his whole-
sale house. They are made by the F. A.

the suspicious actions of the wife and
otner relatives of the deceased nd the

the jury that they had considerable
trouble in petting into the house'; 107 â¢ ruer
reio street, and that they had found a
disposition on the part of the relatives to
conceal the circumstances attending the
crime. The most important witness at the
inquest was Druggist Charles H. Hammit.
whose st re is at 2000 Market street. Mr.
Hammit swore : hat on the evening of the
shooting Mrs. Parry came to his store
considerably agitated and weeping and
Informed him that her husband had been

The police officers and others wen told
that the pistol had â¢en accidentally dis

the weapon out of her hand.

it to him. Her husband forbade her to do
so, arid they went upstairs. She allowed
him to li.ok at the letter and he tore It
into pieces.
After they had talked the matter over
for about half an hour she remembered
that her stepfather, William Van Valken
burs', wanted hie pistol; which was In the
bureau drawer, where she had placed it
about two weeks before, after cleaning it
at his request. Tolling her husband that
st:>- was going to take the pistol to her
stepfather, who was in the back yard
playing with a pup dog; she took the tire
erm-out of the bureau drawer. Her hus
band remonstrated with her on the
ground that she might hurt herself, but
she replied that there was no fear: that

refusing to lay down Ihi pistol he seized

I These were frequent occurrences among

I the clergy Introduced the loving cup,
I which had three handles. . Two for these
were grasped by the host, who drank first
to show that the liquor wa^-jjqt poisoned.:
The giiest then took the cup-by the third.
The host released one handle, the. right
1 hand still holding one, so that he might
help raise the cup and incidentally so
j that his right, hand might be too busy
to draw a sword or dagger. When the
! Riiest had drunk, the host released the
, cup. which was passed to the next one.
The monks in Â«arly times named this the
"pocula cariiatis,"" or Cup of Love. It
was tilled with wine with a piece of ioa<t
floating therein and circulated from right

A CITY'S NARROW ESCAPE.
200.000 People Thought the Dahom-
ians Were Going to Kill Them.
Pew books have been written about
Toruba, <<n the <;ulf <>r" Guinea, W sst
Africa. There Is no part of Africa, ex
cepting the Nile Valley, which is so
densely populated, and yet this country
near the sea was hardly known to
white ntvii a few y ,> ago. This fact
gives all the greater Interest to Mis
sionary Stone's book, "in Africa's For
est and JunÂ«;l'\" just published by the
F. H. Revel! Company, In which he i< -
Bcribes his six years life am m
Yorubans. H-> tells the stbrj â :
narrow escape of Abeokuta, a citj of
200,000 inhabitants, from destruction by
th^ King- of Dahomey a little vvfiile b(
fore he wa.s shorn <>f his power by the
French.
The Kins of Dahomey advanced
against that great city with a large
army. Including several thousand Am i
zor.s, female warriors who were ;N>ih
inp better than human ti^-rs. Mr.
Stone says that one of their favorite
amusements was to Bee which of them
could first p.-t through a high circle oi
thorns to kiil a helpless prisoner tied to
a stake. Though their limbs vvi r â 
shockingly torn by the thorns, they
thought it excellent sport. One Ama
zon could offer Jin greater insult to an
other than to iMt her "You are nothing
but a man," and only the death of one
or the other could settle the difficulty.
Th"y vvi n- past human feeling and
shedding human blood was their chief
delight.
This large army was able, through
favorable circumstances, to advan< â 
within ton miles of Abeokuta without
being detected. A large forest lies b
tween Dahomey and Absokuta. The
thousands of Dahomians had entered
this forest in single file at many places
and had cut their way through it. step
by step, until they, reached Eshagga, a
suburb ten miles from Abeokuta. They
were a month traveling through th
fofdst; and during this tune wen no
permitted to make any noise that should
distinguish them from a wild animal, if
any one forgot himself and spoke in an
ordinary voice he was instantly slain.
Orders to the men wore gh â  n in grunts
<>r barks Like those of monkeys. In this
way they made several ir.i!"s a day,
and united all their columns just before
coming out of th< forest ai Bshagga.
A singular custom of the Yorubans
made it easy for them to get into this
populous suburb. When Yorubans go
to war they do not salute any one, and
it is a gross insult for any one to salute
thorn. The DahqmLans came out on the
road between Eshagga and A.beolruta
about dark. If the King had known it
he might easily have destroyed th great
city that night, for the Yorubans were
wholly unprepared, and did not suspect
the enemy's presence. â  But the- King
thought it unwise to leave 10,000 Yoru
bans in his rear, and therefore deter
mined to destroy EshaÂ°-ga that night
arid assault Abeokuta next day. So his
columns marched toward the suburb,
and those who live there thought the
soldiers were Yorubans on their way to
the war at Ejahway; and as they never
spoke to soldiers on the march they did
not know. the fearful blunder they had
made.
The Dahomians quietly fil< <1 into the
town and encamped in the mark. a
place, the Inhabitants feeling all the
more secure because so ninny soldiers
had come among them. They retired
to rest, little knowing the sword that
vas at tln-ir throats. Soon after the
doomed citj became still the slaughter
began. Nearly 10,000 persons were
killed, only a ft w hundred being spared
to be taken to Dahomey and there of
fered in sacrifice. Everybody else per
ished except one ma:', who, though bad
ly wounded, succeeded in rea< hing Al e
okuta next morning and giving the
alarm. The city was terribly fright
ened but it was found a little later that
tli*- lv>s;ile King had abandoned his
original plan apd hol a Dahomian was
within thirty miles of the City. Ap
parently he was sated with the terrible
slaughter at Eshagga and decided :><
postpone hi? attack on the great city
until the following season. Then the
attack came, but Abeokuta was ready
to defend herself to the utmost, and the
tyrant of Dahomey was repulsed with
heavy foss.â New York Sun.

of the Reunion
Association-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SONOMA, June 17.â The sun rose clear
and hot on the Old Tuolumneites thU
morning, and with scarcely any breezo
stirring and the mercury in the thermom
eter standing above the blood-heat mark
most of the day the celebration has.been a
warm one literally as well as sentiment
ally. The crowds began pouring imo
town shortly after sunrise and kept com
ing on foot and by every means of con- j
veyance all day from every point of the !
compass. The Soulsbyville and Angela
Camp people brought their home banus
with them, and these added to the Tupl
umne cornet band made music plt-nutui. :
The procession formed at 1" 0 clock,
marched through the main street ana
headed for Moringo's Park, where the
grounds and -pavilion had been prepared
for the visitors and decorated on a scu.o j
as elaborate as that of the buildings in j
town. The whole parade would have- be sn
a credit to a much larger place. The gay
uniforms of the members of the Souls*.;. -
ville band, the back load of old forty
niners, the 350 children gayly dressed and
carrying flags, the Dardanelle Parlor, the
float of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West, occupied by the beautiful
Miss Teasy Meyer, dressed as the God
dess of Liberty, 'were features of the pio
cession.
At the pavilion, after a few selections
of music, C. H.- Kurdeti was select, d
chairman of the day. He made a tew re
marks and called oh Rev. \V. T. Curnow,
the chaplain, for a prayer. Music by the
Soulsbyville band, a song of welcome- by
the children, an original recitation by
Mrs. Ford; a duet, "Tuolumne," by
Meedames James Eddy and E. T. Gould;
the reading of a poem, "California." by
Miss Alice Warren, and then came the
oration of the day by ex-Judge Robert
Ferral, an old Tuolumneite. His speech
had been looked forward to by his old
friends here, ami when he arose to speak
they gave him a great ovation.
Judge Ferral > words, brought out by
the Inspiration of th>- occasion, struck
to the hearts of his audience. Aside from
telling the history and purposes of the
association, he read his famous poem.
"The Birth of the Flag." and recalled
many humorous Incidents of olden tim-s.
He said he was not an old man; at least,
when he was out from home they called
him "one of the boys." While speaking
he took a drink nf water, and said it was
the first he had had in a long time, as the
people in San Francisco had ciuit drinking
water until the light with the Spring Val
ley Water Company was over. The ex
cessively warm day brought out many
sparks of humor.
An old-time barbecue followed. Barbe
cued meat, bread, pickels. crackers, but
ter, cake, coffee and ice water were
served. There were no kl'nvs or forks.
and wooden plates and tin cups consti
tuted the tableware. There waa plenty
for all.
After dinner the officers and directors
for the ensuing year were elected as fol
lows:
President. Miss Minnie B. Kalloch, San
Francisco; secretary, L. L. Nelson. San
Francisco; treasurer. Mrs. C. P. Fnrd.

The oldest pioneer present was John
Prairie of Jimtown, who is 82 years old. i
The oldest woman pioneer present was
Mrs. Everhardt. and the best impersona
tiem of a forty-niner was Captain
Knowles. Each of these persons received
So as a prize.
Dancing began soon after dinner and
was kept up most of \h>- night. The old
pioneers, men and women, seemed to j
think they were boys and girls again.
With beaming faces they moved about
the floor as lithe and graceful as they did j
of yore. ___^________

ROBBERY OF THE PEOPLE
STANDABD OIL AND RAILROADS
IN COLLUSION.
The Oil Dealer Goes so Far as
Declare That Corrupt Influ
ences Are Used to Elevate
Judges and Senators.
Special Dispatch to The Cail.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â The Industrial
Commission to-day heard a statement
from L. M. Lockwood, an oil producer of
Zelinople, in opposition to the Standard
Oil Trust. Mr. Lckwood declared that
this company had driven the independent
refineries into bankruptcy and servitude,
and he denounced the course pursued in
severe terms. He held the railroads es
pecially responsible for this condition of
affairs. Going back to 1572, he referred at
length to a contract made by the trunk
lines of Pennsylvania with the South Im
provement Company. Under this con
tract, he said, the freight rates on oil
were doubled and half the amount col
lected was paid back as rebate â not only
this, but the contract company received a
like rebate of the shipments of all other
companies. The contract, he declared,
was secretly continued by the railroads
and the Standard Company. He quoted
A. J. Cassatt, the new president of the
Pennsylvania Ratlroad, as testifying be
fore the Interstate Railway Commission
to the effect that while the open rate to
the public was $1 90 per barrel the rate to
the Standard Company was SO cents.
Further Investigation, said Mr. L,ockwood.
had developed the fact that the general
companies actually received only 35 cents.
This condition of affairs had resulted for
a time, according to the witness, in giv
ing the Standard Company a profit of 400
per cent, while the independent refineries
were being driven rapidly into bank
ruptcy. Mr. Lockwood was free in the
use of epithets, charcterizlng both the oil
company and railroad officials as high
waymen and brigands.
"It you have got to be robbed," he ex
claimed, "it does not matter much
whether you are held up by Dick Turpin
with a pistol or by John Rockefeller with
a railroad; it is robbery all the same." He.
said that men who had carefully analyzed
the testimony taken before the Hepburn
committee estimated that in \% months'
time the Hve trunk lines of Pennsylvania
had paid the Standard Company $11,000,1
in rebates. The railroad companies had,
he said, completely ignored the order of
the Industrial Suite Commission -to stop
their discrimination in favor of the Stan
dard Company, resorting then to the sys
tem of false billing.
Speaking of the remedy for the evil,
Mr. Lockwood said it was in government
ownership of the railroads and not to be
found in courtsâ the courts were too slow
and expensive.
"The railroads and the oil company can
razoo a man un and down in the courts
for ten years. he said, "until he is
ruined, and then go on with their work,
leaving thi-tr victim stranded. As a re
ward the combines elevate their instru
ments to higher places politically. Thus
It was that the thought of the common
people was gradually becoming fixed to
the effect that the great railroad com
bines were gradually packing the Supreme
Courts with men in sympathy with their
monopolistic tendencies, and who would
do* their bidding. Thus the interstate
commerce law was rendered Ineffective.
"If the railroad companies can control
the appointment of the Attorney General'
and or Justices of the Supreme Court,
what do they care for the law?" the wit
ness asked.
The only safe plan, said Mr. Loekwood,
was t" take the railroads out of the hand?
of the corporations and place them under
control of the Government, so that every
man could go to market as cheaply as
every other man. He considered all the
railroads of the country as specially gi
gantic trusts and asserted that they were
In control of our politics, contributing nvl
lions to elect legislators, Senators and
Judges, and to punish those not willing to
do their bidding. \Vlth absolute equality
over the roads the Independent companies
would drive the Standard Company into a
secondary place in a short time. There
would then, he asserted, be no mor>>
shooting down of striking miners, for the
miner could send his product to market
as cheaply as the mine monopolist. So in
all other lines of business. If the Gov
ernment did not control the roads the
railroads would control the Government.
He advocated the taking of the roads
under the right of eminent domain, pay
ing the owners the actual value of the
property.
The afternoon session of the commission
was characterized by the development of
difficulties among the members of the
commission as to the character of testi
mony that should be admitted. Mr. l.ock
wood made the statement that Judge Al
bert Haight of the New York Court of
Appeals had been elevated to his position
by the corporations, through the use of a
corruption fund, because of his action in
what was known as the Matthews case,
a proceeding of a railroad combination
against the independent refineries. He
afterward said that, while convinced the
facts were as he had stated, he had not
seen the fund, and therefore the statment
was an Inference only.
At this point Mr. Farquhar of the com
mission rose to protest against the char
acter of the testimony, saying that Judge*
Haight was his next-door neighbor and
one of the purest men he ever knew. He
had never before heard an imputation
upon his character. He appealed to Mr.
Lockwood to have, the statement stricken
out of his testimony. The statement, he
said, was not testimony, but it was pure
libel.
Mr. I^ockwood said that ho also know
Judge Haight and that he had boon sur
prised at the apparent developments. The
issue had been raised in the campaign and
he understood that he ran behind his
ticket.
After a few general remarks by others
of the commission as to tho advisability
of striking out the entire statement, Con
gressman Bell arose and made a vigorous
protest against the demand to eliminate
any of the testimony. It was not. he said,
the province of the commission to tell a
witness what he must nay. He said he
had noticed that some members of the
commission were very sensitive when
something was said which did not entirely
fall in with their predilections. It was
perfectly competent for any man com
ing here to entertain opinions upon any
of these subjects and to advance them,
or to criticize public officials. In this con
nection, he said Governor Larrabee of
Wyoming had said that there were two
Judges on the Supreme Court bench who
wore put there for the purpose of secur
ing the nullification "l the Granger law.
He also instanced other cases in which
Hie railroads had secured the appoint
ment of Judges whose sympathies were
with them. If this was true, said Mr.
Bell, why should a man be barred from
saying so? And If the commission v.-as
not going to permit such testimony he
would be compelled to say. when It came
to making the report of the commission,
that it had not been non-partisan.
As another illustration of the manipula
tions on the part of the railroads, he
quoted a Republican member of the Con
gressional Postal Commission as saying
that Its proceedings would come to naught ;
been use the Second Assistant Post mast Â»r
--(Jeneral. who had charge of these matters,
is in sympathy with the railroads. A
man was not sacred, he declared, because
of the place he occupied, and if a judge
on the bench is elevated to his position
by devious means it would not bo the duty
(if the commission to screen him.
Former Congressman Phillips, presiding,
hold that the testimony was competent.
In his statement before the commission
yesterday. President C. E. Dowe of the
Commercial Travelers' Association sub- '
mined figures to show that the organiza
tions of the trusts had resulted in throw
ing 35.000 salesmen out of employment, and
in reducing the salaries of 25.000 more. He
estimated that the annual loss to the
salesmen on account of loss of employ
ment and reductions aggregated $60,000 -
000, to the hotels $28.C00.000 and to the
railroads $27,000,000, because of the loss of
patronage. m

WITNESS FOUND
TO BE A LUNATIC
Moore Defense Given a
Setback.
BURNS PROVES A FAILURE
CLAIMED TO HAVE SEEN THE
KILLING OF KILBOY.
When Called to the Stand It Is Dis
covered That the Man Is Crazy
and Possessed of Weird
Hallucinations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA CITY, June 17.â The de- j
fense in the murder case of the people
against Moore received a staggering
blow to-day. The first thing at the
opening of the morning session Law
yer Tyrrell called Francis X. Burns to
the stand. Mr. Burns has long lived
here and claims to be a mining expert
and promoter. He had a few days ago
confided to Lawyer Tyrrell that from
the window of his room in the Morgan
& Roberts block he had seen the whole i
of the bloody affray In which Police- j
man Kilroy met his death. He had ;
said that the policeman brutally at- ;
tacked Moore, who kept warning him !
back; that finally the officer knocked
down the lone prospector from Little
Deer Creek and then the latter had j
commenced tiring in self-defense.
Burns was sworn. District Attorney
Power objected to the taking of his
evidence on the ground that he was
not only mentally irresponsible, but an
out-and-out lunatic. Mr. Power was
granted permission by Judge Nilon to
interrogate the witness. Burns waÂ» j
voluble. He said he had for a time
thought he could not be present at the
trial, because he had been correspond
ing with the Government ab'mt g"ing
to Manila as a chief of scouts, but hn
I had finally concluded to stay, because
i he could not get the position he wanted.
He had himself been annoyed by in
fluences exerted over him by what he
called "whistlers."
They had also bothered Professor
Langley of the Smithsonian Institution,
while that gentleman was experiment
ing with flying machines. Ex-Cham
pion "Bob" Fitzsimmons was another j
! victim. These "whistlers" used long
! glass tubes filled with a wonderful fluid,
by the aid of which they exercised su
pernatural powers over those to whom
they directed their attention. He
j talked on at random about hawkshaws
I and other irrelevant matters, and final
ly admitted he was some years ago In
the Home for the Incurable Insane at
j Agnews. Much of his queer tale was
based on a fantastic sketch printed in
a recent issue of the Black Cat.
The prosecution offered to show by
expert evidence also that Burns was
deranged, and he was withdrawn from i
i the stand pending the investigation.
Edward H. Moore Sr. of Oakland, the ,
i 80-year-old father of the alleged mur
! derer. testified that he had an uncle,
\ brother, sister and nephew who were
crazy; another brother at Lovelock, !
j Nev., who was "queer," and that the '
; defendant's mother died a lunatic. He
said the prisoner had been hnrt three
times on the head since he was six
years old, and had always been de- |
mented.
Many prominent citizens who had ,
known the prisoner, now 52 years old, â ,
: since he was a boy, swore that in their
opinion he had always been crazy in
i part or wholly. Most of them thought 'â 
; that he at times was unable to dls- ;
j criminate between right and wrong.
Next week the prosecution will bring
forward many, witnesses who think ;
Moore is nothing more than an eecen- |
trie and vicious fellow of keen intelli- !
gence and remarkable memory.

OAKLAND, June 17.â The police arc

It is said that a certain gentleman has

A week ago Th* Call published, ex

against the methods pursued by the
Board of Education in the recent examin
ation. Since that time the matter lias
: been agitated in several townships, and

made, the latest coming from Pleasanton.
; County Superintendent Crawford made

i the lPi<Â«t foundation for these charges.
He says the examinations were held at
Livermore because that place is more
central. He prepared the questions and
sent them, sealed, to the postoffice at
Livermore. No class, said Mr. Crawford.
, could possibly have had any advantage
or have seen the questions in advance.

OAKLAND TO BECOME A
GRAIN TRADE CENTER
DEEPENING HARBOR CREATES
OPPORTUNITIES.
Plans Framed for the Building of
Balfour, Guthrie & Co.'s Pro
posed Big Warehouses.
OAKLAND, June 17.â John L. Howard
has framed plans for the Improvement
of the old nail works property at the foot
of Market street, recently purchased by
Ralfour, Guthrie & Co., and it now trans
pires that the great shipping firm pro
poses to erect thereon a large grain ware
house, construct a wharf and conduct a
genera] grain shipping business from this
point. The contract for the erection of a
bulkhead on the water front adjoining the
old nail works has been let to Johnson &
Peterson. The bulkhead is to extend out ;
to the Government bulkhead line, and be
yond this a wharf is to he contracted out
as far as the pier-head line permits. A
contract for dredging will be let In a few
days, and it is proposed to pump the !
slickens and muds into the bulkhead in
closure.
The proposed -warehouses will be of cor
rugated Iron and brick, and of a capacity
for holding 8000 tons of grain. Railroad
tracks will be laid on each side, and It
is probable that, when the entire im
provement has been completed, most of
the 'grain produced south of the bay, In I
Alameda, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and 1
Monterey counties, will be shipped from
Oakland harbor, and Balfour, Guthrie & :
Co. will thus be enabled to load their I
largest ships at the foot of Market street
and send them off to Liverpool and Ant

nia Without Taking En

BERKELEY. June 17.â There are now
ninety-one high schools and academies in
the State whose graduates are entitled to
enter the University of California without
taking entrance examinations. A list of
these has been prepared by the university
faculty, showing the standing of each
school which the professors have exam
ined. The number on the list is larger
than in any previous year and the stand
ard of scholarship shown reveals a
marked improvement in the secondary
education of the State. While the uni
versity is gradually raising the standard
of scholarship for entering students, the
number of the. latter is continually In
creasing, and the professors attribute this
largely to the excellent system of sec
ondary schools which It has been their in
terest to foster.
The college sends out every year a
corps of examiners, who report in detail
each high school which they visit. It is
upon their recommendation that the grad
uates of these institutions are admitted
to Berkeley by -merely presenting their

Albert Anderson, while playing with I
several companion? In the torn-up I
roadway of San Pablo avenue at Thir- 1

dray this evening and almost instantly I
killed. The children were playing on I
and about the materials to be used in I
the construction of the new electric I
railway on the avenue, and the Ander- I
son hoy stood on a small pile of broken I
rock as the dray, belonging to ,T. C, I
Westphal & Sons and driven by John â BflÃflÃflÃflÃflÃflÃflÃflÃflÃfll
W. Allard. came along the avenue. Just as the dray was passing the pile on
which Albert stood he slipped and rolled beneath the heavy rear wheel, which
passed over his body.
The injured boy was removed to the Receiving Hospital, but he breathed
his last on the way there. The boy's father was immediately notified, and.
rushing to the hospital, inquired for the little one of Steward Borchert.
The news of his son's death so staggered him that he fell In a faint at Bor
chert's feet. With > tears streaming down his cheeks, Mr. Anderson shortly
afterward called at the newspaper offices to change the death notice of his
daughter and announcing a postponement of the funeral, so that his two
little ones could be Interred at the game time.
Chief Fletcher Immediately ordered the arrest of Allard, the teamster,
as a. matter of form, and the latter was booked for manslaughter at the City
Prison. He was released afterward on his own recognizance.
"My God, I do not believe I can stand this terrible blow," said the heart
broken' father to-night. "And it will surely kill his mother. Poor Albert was
an unlucky boy. "When 3 years old he was sitting on the curb not far from
where he lost "his life to-night and the wheels of a wagon ran over his little
feet. His sister. Lorine, thought all the world of him, and it just seems as
though she called him to her to-night."
Mrs. Anderson lies unconscious at her home. She is in total ignorance of
her son's sad death. When advised this evening that her boy had met with
ah accident she sank to the floor, and up to a late hour to-night had not
regained consciousness. Her condition Is regarded as critical. The untimely
death of the Anderson children is one of the saddest recorded in this county,
hardly excepting the case of some few years ago, when the two little Booth
girls were killed by an electric car.
REV, DR, LAW
RESIGNS FROM
HIS CHURCH
Will Not Occupy His
Pulpit To-Day.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
908 Broadway. June 17.
Rev. Marshall Law, D.D., M.D.. has re
\ signed from the charge of the Church of
: the Advent. The resignation has been
'. given verbally by the rector to the clerk
: of. the vestry, but it will not take effect
until August 31.
Next Tuesday Dr. Law will go East fot
a lengthy vacation, but will receive full
pay for some months, as this is the only
manner in which the vestry could secure
the much desired resignation.
At to-morrow's services R. Burr, a '
! member of the vestry, will preach, and
this will signalize the severanco of the
rector's actual connection with the
I church.
The vestrymen made their demand that
Mr. Law leave the church so plain and
forcible that there was practically no al
! tentative. The rector had a good deal to
say about ecclesiastical law, which makes
it impossible for any vestry to remove ,x
rector against his will except for some
gross- offense. No one has even intimated
that Dr. Law has rendered himself .liable
to expulsion, but all of the vestrymen
agree in the opinion that a change is for
the best.
C. B. Foote ridicules the idea of Dr.*
Law's opposition. "What do we do with
the servant we do not want?" said he.
"We simply tell him that his services are
no longer required and that is the end of
it. All we have to do is to stop Dr. Law-:
salary and he will not wish to rem.ii,i.
Dr. Law always wanted too much pub
licity."
John J. Valentine, the senior vestryman,
will not say one word and declines to even
reply to Dr. Law's remarks concerning
the uncharitable manner in which Mr.
Valentine Is said to have acted.
It is reported that Dr. Law has made
an application for a position in the United
States Mint. Fie is a licensed allopa'.nlo
doctor, and before entering the ministry
was a successful practitioner.

The Washington Elm in Cambridge.
A slow but sure process of decay is tak
ing place in the Washington Elm. and if
is feared by the Cambridge Park Depart
ment, which has charge of the historic
tree, that it will be impossible to save it
for more than a few years longer. A
short time ago workmen went over the
tree and cot off a considerable amount of
dead wood, and it was evident from the
condition in which they found it that it
will not be very long before the entire,
tree is dead. The process of decay is
gradual, but is constantly affecting pre
viously sound branches, and a watch has
to be kept all the time to keep the dead
wood cleared away. The tree is now such
a shadow of what It once was that there
la not very much left to keer> alive. It Is
intended to make a thorough overhauling
of the tree in the spring, and to do every
thing possible to preserve its life. It will
not be necessary to put on any more iron
bands, as there is no danger of its falling
to pieces, but the measures which must
be taken are those which will best retard
the process of decay.â Boston Transcript.
GEORGE W. CHILDS" HOME.
Sale of the House in Which He En-
tertained Illustrious Guests.
The residence of the late George W.
Childs, at the northeast corner of Twen
ty-st-cond and Walnut streets, has been
sold to William F. Deakyne, a real -state
dealer. The price paid has not been made !
public, nor is Mr. Deakyne ready to an
nounce his purpose so far as a future (
disposition of the property is concerned.
There is more than a passing interest in
this magnificent residence, for in its asso
ciations it is almost historic. Within its
walls distinguished men and women from
every part of the world were entertain >'.
and "there were many brilliant receptions,
and dinners, especially during that great j
period of Philadelphia social lifeâ the Cen- ,
tennial exhibition. General and Mrs.
Grant were frequent guests, as were Mr.
and Mrs. Hamilton Fish, while Monekton
Milnes (Lord Houghton), John Bright. M.
P., of Rochdale; Joseph Chamberlain,
Dean Stanley. W. W. Story, the sculptor;
Henry Wailsworth Longfellow, Ralph :
Waldo Emerson. Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes. Mr. Evarts, Miss Charlotte Cush- :
man. Lord Dufferin, George Augustus
Sala. Mr. Tyndall. Mr. Froude. Wilkie
Collins, Professor Joseph Henry and Vice
President Henry Wilson were a few of the I
many distinguished persons who were en- i
tertalned in the mansion at various times.
The Emperor and Empress of Brazil, as
guests of Mr. and Mrs. Childs. received
from TOO to 800 people there in 1576.
Mr. and Mrs. Childs moved into the
house on December 19. 1871, and occupied :
it during the winter of each succeeding ,
year until the death of Mr. Childs. On I
June 30. ISM, Mr. Childs' friend and asso
ciate, Anthony J. Drexel, died, and from
that time until February 3, ISM, when Mr. i
Childs died, he was desirous of selling his '
property and Of retiring to bis Wootton j
home. Mrs. Childs continued to reside at \
th<> Walnut street house for three months
after her husband's death, but since that
time has resided in Washington. D. C.,
where she has erected a larger mansion j
for herself. Numerous offers for (he Wai- I
nut street property have been made, but t
none of them was quite satisfactory.
Somewhat more than a week ago Mrs.
Childs determined to offer the property at .
auction.
The mansion is a white marble struc
ture, three stories in height, nnd was
built by Mr. Childs. ThÂ«- property has a
frontage on Walnut street of forty-.eight
feet and a depth of 136 feet, and Includes
a stable and carriage house. When com
pleted and furnished the buildings and
their contents cost not less than half a
million dollars. Every appointment was
of the finest, the workmanship and ma
terials were of the best, and the masonry
and iron work wen- the most substantial
that could be bad.â Philadelphia Ledger
A Bride's Accomplishments.
There was a wedding out in the whoor
ing western part of Kansas the other
day, and In speaking of the bride the local
paper said: "She is one of the idrls who
care nothing or pnint and pride, and can
ride a pony forty miles over our prairie-3
and I'll, bet a hairpin against a nickel's
worth of candy that she can beat any one
running a foot race, or rein a pony in a
herd of cattle and cut out ten head as
quick as any one can." ft should bo un

States, the standard of accomplishment
varies with the locality.â Topeka (Kans )

KIDNEY TROUBLE.
The Most Prevalent, Dangerous and
f ': Deceptive Disease.
Thousands Have It and Don't Know It.
Pains and aches come from excess of
uric acid in the blood, doe to neglected
kidney trouble. Kidney trouble causes
quick or unsteady heart beats, and
makes rle feel as though they had
heart trouble, because the heart is
overworking to pump the thick, kid-
ney-poisoned blood through the veins
and arteries.
Soreness or uncomfortable feeling in
the back indicates kidney trouble of no
small importance. â¢
The passinr of scanty or profuse
quantities of urine is a warning of kid-
ney trouble. If you want to- feel well
you can make no mistake by first doc-
toring your kidneys.
The famous new discovery, Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, is the true specific
for kidney, bladder and urinary trou-
bles. It has cured thousands of appar-
ently homeless cases after all other ef-
forts have failed.

HE SAW HIS FINISH
Peculiar Experience of a Clerk With
Attorney General Garland.
"When Mr. Garland was Attorney Gen
eral," said one of the long-service clerks
"i the Department of Justice to a Wash
ington Post reporter, "he had a long and
continuous performance series of com
plaints from a lot of New Fork merchants
on the subject or" the debts of a. young
lawyer from the hip- town, who was em
ployed in the department. Mr. Garland
was not a believer in the system of exact-
Ing the payment of private debts by Gov
ernment employes by the use of the offi
cial thumbscrew, and he made it a point
to decline to receive persona] complaints
of this sort while he was in office. But the
letters of the New York creditors of this
young man became- so petulant and
threatening thnt the Attorney General
finally sent for the debtor to ask him
if he was making- any effort to settie.
" 'Young man.' said the Attorney Gen
eral when the subject of the complaints
entered his office, "just read over a few
of these letters, will you; and then tell
me if you think it's pleasant for me to
have my mall burdened with such effu
sions?"
'â¢ 'Oh. creditors' letters. I suppose.' re
plied the young man coolly. 'What do
they supppose you've got to do with my
debts, sir?"
" 'I have been endeavoring to arrive at
some answer to that question myself.' n -
plied Mr. Garland. 'Their desire is, how
ever, to have me put it to you that you
have either got to pay these debts or be
discharged from the Government employ.'
" "That's nice of them. I'm sure, sir."
replied the youth from New York. 'Then
i supppose I'm to be fired?"
" "Suppose you just doff your flippant
manner.' said the Attorney General se
verely, 'and tell me about these debts.
Are they all straight?"
" 'Straight as a sirinsr. sir." replied the
young man frankly. '1 contracted them
ht a period when 1 was industriously en
gaged in playing the races, poker and the
devil, and I've never been able to get my
head above water since, although I've
been blowing in $1000 out of my yearly
In a vain attempt to square up with
these people ever since I got this job in
the Department of Justice.'
"The Attorney General looked the young
fellow over. ,
"Well <lo the best you can, my boy.
he said, and three days later the young
New Yorker was promoted to a $2500 po
sition. His New York creditors probably
still preserve the redhot letters which Mr.
Garland wrote them in reply to their vio
lent demands for the thumbscrewing of
the young man.

VALOR AND PATRIOTISM
RECOGNIZED BY CITIZENS
State of Washington's Gift to Dewey's Flagship Olympia.
y? OVERS pf the beautiful in decorative silver art will hr given an opportunity to-morrow of pazinp at a magnifi
cent silver service, which is to be presented to Dewey's flagship "Olympia." by the citizens of th< State nf
Washington. It will be on exhibition ;\\ Shreve & Company's store for a week before bring; forwarded to its
)i /] donors, and from there will probably be taken to New i'ork and presented to the officers and men of the pro
tected cauiser on its arrival from abroad.
The style of the pieces is modeled after a pattern of the period of George [I. Each piece is decorated with oak
leaves and acorns. This form of decoration was decided on as it is an established form of decoration in naval design-
Ing, being symbolical of strength: the acorn being an insignia of rank. Each piece will bo stamped with the seal of the
State of Washington, seal of the Navy Department and the name of the ship within a laurel wreath. The pieces are
unusually large and. massive, it is the most elaborate silverware set ever m;i<!>' on this roast and will be the most
expensive in the navy. The patriotic res;.!, nts of Washington spared neither money nor pains In preparing their offer-
Ing.
The winged statuette of Victory. Intended to commemorate the victory of May 1. was modeled by Douglas Tilden,
The figure is so arranged that it can be easily transferred from the top of the punch bowl to the center piece. A
handle will be provided for the top of the punch bowl cover to be used when the tigure is not placed thereon; and the
shaft or pedestal upon which the figuri stands when secured in the center piece is removable with tin- figure and In
tended, when removed, to rest upon an el y base, thus forming separately a beautiful ornament, and the center
piece and punch bowl will be complete without the figure.
Aside from the tigure of victory, the most beautiful piece js the large tray on which is inscribed the name of
Admiral Dewey and every officer and man who was aboard the flagship on that memorable morning in May. The set
comprises a punch bowl, tray and ladle, water kettle with tray and stand, coffee pot, tea pot, cream pitcher and sugar
bowl, three meat dishes, different sizes, gravy boat and tray, two loving cups, win. cooler, tureen, center piece, one pair
of candelabra, having seven lights eaach, two compotiers and two serving trays. There are also four dogen cut
glass punch cups, specially designed for the Olympia. I
The above articles, beautiful in their workmanship, costly in their manufacture and priceless by reason of the
generosity of their donors, will grace the table of the Olympia on state occasions and remind the men who serve on
her that in the State of Washington there is a host of people who appreciate valor and patriotism.

The celebration of ihe one hundred and
twenty-fourth anniversarj' of the battle
df Bunker Hill at Sunsei Park yesterday
under the Joint auspices of the Bunker
Hill Association. California Sons of
American Revolution and the California
Pioneers was a huge success In every
detail. Patriotism reigned supremi and
many w:Â« th< eulogies pronounced over
the brave boys of the Revolution who first
sounded the keynote of freedom on the
historic hillside.
A train of ten cars, loaded with happy
youth and staid old age, left the Aiameda
mole at 8 o'clock In the morning, followed
by another of twelve cars an hour later,
and both were soon going at a merry
clip through tlie pleasant scenery for
which that section in famous. It was a
three hours' ride, and when the 3000 pic
nickers arrived at the pleasure grounds
they set about unpacking the pood things
which they had brought to feed the Inner
man, and- woman, too. After appetites
had been satiated everybody adjourned
to the pavilion, where the exercises in
honor of the day were, hH<l at l o'clock.
After an overture of patriotic airs by
the band and a prayer by the chaplain of
the day. Rev. T. J. Lacey, opening re
marks were made l>y Hon. William <i.
Badger, president of the day. He con

patriotism In assisting to honor the hfs

of freedom.
Robert Duncan then sanp with splendid
effect â¢â The Sword of Bunker Hill, " and
was obliged to respond with an encore.
The oration was delivered hy Hon.
Frank McGowan, and was punctuated
with frequent applause.
After referring to the principles that
actuated every American citizen In up
holding the love of country, Mr. McGowan
devoted his attention to the battle of
Bunker Hill, which he said was one of
the greatest and most memorable events
In the history of the republic.
"One of the permanent results of tho
War of the Rebellion," he continued, "of
which the historic battle of June 17. 177."..
was really the commencement, is the
establishment of constitutional Rorern
ment in the New World. Let us seek to
perpetuate that condition by a strict ad
herence to the lines of duty and principles
laid down by the founders of this great
nation, for it was they who marked every
action by an unalterable devotion to the
cardinal doctrines of an American democ
racy."
Mis? Millie Flynn, the talented soprano,
sang: "The Star Spangled Banner" in a
way that roused her hearers to a high
pitch of enthusiasm.
An original poem by Charles S. Greene,
entitled "June IT, 177r>." was well received.
The rest of the programme wa. c as fol
