CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD
COMES BACK TO CALIFORNIA
BEFORE JEFFRIES
FITZSIMMONS GOES
DOWN IN DEFEAT
JAMES L JEFFRIES, Champion of the World.
NEW YORK, June 9.âFitz
simmons, old I dog
that he is, went once
often to the ring .
Jeffries, the i alif< >rnia boiler
maker, knocked him out after a
terrific battle in the eleventh
round. Fitzsimmons had been
dazed in the tenth and had been
knocked down before that.
"Jeff," a perfect Hercules, who
had been out-pointed early in the
fight, showed his great n
tive powers later, and while
champion followed him up close
nd tried to land a decis
blow, he received it himself and

champion was stunned. His
mighty arms fell a little from
their true p< isition. In an instant
Jeffrie-' righi shot right across
and the mighty Fitzsimmons was
n and out. i [c fell on his
face, rolled over on his .side and
then >1< â  upon his hack. His
lanky form si find his anus
lay wide open on the floor.
Bleeding and unconscious he lay
in the dust where his good right
arm had sent man) a man before
him. His gameness had been
great and admirable.
He was practically a beaten
man when lie was knocked down
twice in the tenth round. I [is
terrible blows and his greater
agility had wearied the boiler
maker, but as often as Fitzsim
mons landed Jeffries was tired
rather than really groggy.
There is no doubt that in the
ninth round Fitz thought himself
a winner, as he did also in the

! third. He looked like it and his
backers believed that he had
sized his man up and would soon
land the decisive blow.
But that is the history of all
battles. Jeffries was simply tre
mendous. He is the ring giant
and, awkward as was his stoop
ing position, he landed on the
champion with an ease which sur
prised his warmest admirers. In
fact he proved what Corbett and
other finished boxers had said of
Fitzsimmons, that he is not the
â  most difficult man to hit.
Defeated in what was to have
been and doubtless will be his last
battle, old "Fitz" gave the sport
. ing public what, in their own
language, was the greatest run
i for their money they have had in
a decade. lie was beaten down,
not alone by sheer weight and
tremendous strength, but by a
deceiving style of fighting which
often led him to place his jaw in
jeopardy. In the early part of
the fight, in the fourth and fifth
rounds, the realization seemed to !
come to Fitzsimmons that he
must make a short fight or none.
His boast that we would win in
two rounds was forgotten, as was
Chief Devcry's threat that he
would stop the bout after the
first hard blow.
Fitzsimmons went to the floor
four times in all. and he was often
bathed in his own blood, but the
Chief of Police sat through it as
it was predicted that he would
until the heart-broken seconds
carried Fitzsimmons from the
ring and brought him back to
sensibility. Then the champion
knew that the mighty shout
which shook the building and
which rang in his dulled ears was

not for him and, leaning his head
upon his hands, the man of iron
wept like a child.
Experts who watched the bat
tle thought Jeffries was done at
the end of the. seventh, but after
that his youth asserted itself and
his tremendous reserve strength
came to his rescue. Fitzsim
mons, on the other hand, was
growing desperate, and in the
eighth Jeffries had something the
best of it. But after the fight was
over the experts could think of
no man in the business to-day
who is at once big enough and
scientific enough to make a good
fight for the boiler-maker. One
thing is certain, no middleweight
can do the trick. There must
come now another giant to fight
a giant. Jeffries is not a finished
sparrer, but he is wonderfully
quick for a man of his tremen
dous size â the quickest big man
sporting men are saying to-night,
just as they used to say of John
L. Sullivan when he was in his
prime.
Jeffries is bigger than Sullivan,
and never was so big a man
trained so fine. Had he had any
superfluous flesh he could never
have stood the pace cut out for
him. But he stood it and im
proved at the very time his
chances seemed poorest.
When Jeffries stripped a
mighty cry of approval went up
from the thousands about the
ring. An old-time fighter cried
out with an oath: "He is the
biggest beast 1 ever saw train. If
he ever gets to Fitzsimmons its
all over."
While there was this jubilant scene
in Jeffries' corner, Martin Julian,
"Dan" Hickey and "Jack" Everhardt,
ihe seconds of Flu, wearing Bloomy
looks, climbed through the ropes and
tenderly picked up the unconscious ami
beaten Fitz and carried him to his
corner and seated him In his chair.
"Fitz" was still groggy when his
Beconds placed him in the chair, and
his head fell forward on his breast.
He was bleeding freely from the mouth
and nose and evidently suffering con
siderable pain. His seconds worked
gallantly over him for several mo
ments, and nlprns of returning anima
tion were visible. Gradually the cham
pion's normal condition returned and
he looked about him in a dazed way.
When he finally realized his position,
that he wua no longer the peerless
fighter of the day, hi? eyes moistened
and tears trickled down his cheeks.
He looked over at his successful "p
--ponent, shook his head and then r-sted
his eyes on the floor. He felt his posi
tion keenly, but his seconds cheered
him, and after a moment he shook off
his feeling of despondency, straight
ened up. and, after petting the blood
wiped off his face and a shower of
water on his face, put on his bath robe
and walked out of the ring which he
had entered the champion of the world.
a beaten man.
Just before "Fitz" retired Jeffries
rushed hi ross the ring and shook hands
with hi- beaten adversary. Time of
final round, one minute and thirty sec
onds.
STORY OF THE* BATTLE
FOR THE CHAMP TONSHIP
There Were Few Bets, and Yet
Never Was Such Interest
Taken in a Ring Fight
NEW YORK, June The early at
tendance at the ringside was not as
good as had been expected. At 8:30 the
great arena, which holds 9000 persons,
was occupied by only about one-third
of that number. But inside the build
ing the mighty hum of lighting talk
arose, and outside thousands pressed
close upon the clubhouse in spite of
the cordon of police, enjoying the fresh
air and waiting within striking dis
tance of the various entrances until
the time of the fight approached.
; Chief of Police Devery went to Coney
Island early and personally supervised
the police arrangements. There was
an army of poU-emen on hand, all the
larger, perhaps, because it was gen
erally said that any Interruption of the
tight would be the signal for a riot
among the ten thousand men inside
the clubhouse and perhaps twice as
many more outside, all hungry for a
fight to it finish that would be no
child's play. Deputy Chief McLaugh
lin was second in command and, chief
oij staff and veteran as he is. he was
everywhere.
A faint blue cloud of smoke began
to dim the electric lights by a quarter
before nine, at which time there was
only a half-light in the arena, as the
fierce white light which was to beat
upon the ring later had not then been
turned on. There was little betting at
this early hour. Men who had talked
fight for a month talked it over again
at the ringside, using the same old ar
guments in favor of their choice. Oc
casionally, when some well-known
Sporting man emerged from the crush
about the $5 seats and made his way
slowly to a box there was a shout of
recognition.
Occasionally a man high up on one
Bide of the ring shouted across to an
acquaintance on the other such pleas
antries as, "Well, I see your finish.
That stiff you are betting on will be.
clone in a punch," and the reply would
come back. "I won't have to walk
home, like you will."
The ring was empty, but a chair in
either corner told where the principals
wen- to be placed, and the supersti
tious, always in evidence, at a fight,
talked seriously with one another
about Jeffries' misfortune in having
the unlucky corner. This simply meant
that Fitzsimmons had won the toss for
choice and presumably had chosen the
corner in which had been seated the
fewest losers in the past.
By twenty minutes to nine o'clock
all of the seats except the most ex
pensive ones were practically filled,
and it was clear the clubhouse, which
Is supposed to seat 8600 persons, would
be jammed to the doors, and now the
hum of fighting talk grew louder and
one could guess at the volleying roar
which ' was to come later when the
fighters appeared and moved to their
places.
Already It was a mighty crowd, and
all seemed confident there would be no
police interference and that they would
see what they had paid and hoped for,
the greatest heavy-weight contest ever
pulled off in the East. A vitagraph
company had a stand erected above the
heads of the spectators about sixty
feet from the ring. Men were ready
and waiting long before 9 o'clock to
seize with their machine every feint
and blow of the big fighters.
The boxes began filling, and here and
there one heard the cry "Two to one
on Fitz," and the reply, "You are on
for fifty or a hundred." .;. ; :
The men rested in their dressing
rooms calmy, according to their man
agers and seconds, but in reality wish
ing the referee had said his preliminary
piece and that the gong had sounded
for the first round. The Jeffries men
at the ringside held out for odds of 2 to
1, and as that seemed a long price to
many, laying was slow for a time.
Later on perhaps in to 7 would better
express the price, which in Broadway
late in- the afternoon had ruled at
about $1000 to $600. By 10 minutes to
9 more than two-thirds of all the seats
were crowded, and those which were
not filled at that time had been sold
and so the managers were not wor
ried on that score.
It was a great crowd, not only sport
ing men, in the general sense, but
bankers, lawyers, doctors and others
foremost in every prominent walk in
life were to be seen around the ring.
The fact that It was down here by the
sea lent more of the old-time 'fighting
I color to the bout than would have been
the case had It been held in the city.

wanted a fight, pure 'and' simple, and
I cared nothing for the bickerings of the

9 o'clock half of the restless thousands
who surrounded the ring were standing
up and discussing one or another ex

were surrounded by groups who list
ened intently to every word they let
fall, as, for instance, when "Billy" Ed

"Fltzsimmons ought to win," he said,
'and I think he will, if he is as good

it was announced at 9:15 that the
principals were In readiness and would
enter the ring at 9:30, according to the
programme. The picture machine, its i
manager said, was in fine working
order and would prove a success.
The great arena at this time, a quar
ter past 9, was filled, with the exeep- i
tion of some vacancies in the $L'O seats.
and the hum of fighting talk was he
coming a roar. Men talked louder than
USU a] in order to be heard, and a bab
ble of sound was the result.
Half past 9 o'clock came, but did not

edge Thm Jeffries moved slowly
through the crowd from the north of
the clubhouse, and a roar greeted his
appearance. But, instead of climbing
Into the ring, he moved on to his dress

became quieter.

! of many, there was still "nothing do

! a towel to whet the fighting appetite
of waiting thousands. They began to
whistle and stamp and applaud.
But the coy fighters still kept under
cover. Chief Devery had taken up his
station near Fitz's corner, where the
lieht fell full upon his face and hun
dreds tried to read from his counte
nance whether the men would be
stopped when hard blows began to fly
or whether, as was the general ex-
I pectation, they would go on to a finish.
Jim Corbett arrived near the ringside
at 12 minutes to 10, and a little <jf the
pent-up enthusiasm was lavished upon

and took his seat where he could watch

; This was the northeast corner. Cor
bett was immediately surrounded with
men who urged him to tell them the
I last news bearing on the battle and
! who wanted a "stable tip. "
The absence of a preliminary bout
tried the crowd's patience extremely.
Most of those present had been waiting
for three hours as they would have

wanted to see one or the other of the

A conspicuous feature prior to the
fight was the absence of betting, but
few beta being pia 'ed, and they were
all small-sized affairs. Fitz opened a
10 to S favorite, with no takers. The
odds finally lengthened to 2 to 1, at
â which figure several hundreds were bet.
Of the noted betting men very few
were in evidence, bo far as wagers
were concerned. Jeffries' admirers,
vhile believing in many respects he
had an advantage, hesitated about
placing their money owing to his lim
ited ring experience as compared with
Fitzsimmons, and doubting in their
minds as to whether he would have
stage fright or not when he put up his
hands against the "lanky fellow."
There were fewer bets made than on
any heavy-weight championship battle
ever fought In this country.
The New York admirers of Fitz hesi
tated about placing their money, ow
ing to a feeling of apprehension on ac
count of Chief Devery's known attitude
toward fighters. It was remarkable to

Levy and Pittsburg Phil, who usually

contests, look on and not bet a dollar.
Prior to the appearance of the men
in the ring a conference took place be
tween George Siler, the referee: Fitz,
his manager, Martin Julian, and Jef
fries and his manager, "Billy" Brady.
There was a long wrangle over certain
clauses in the articles of agreement as
to the probable action of the referee in
the event of certain contingencies aris
ing. The conference lasted for twenty
minutes. At its conclusion the referee
announced that in the event of one
man holding with both hands, the oth
er would have the right to thump
away until he freed himself from the
other's hold. Should both men resort
to holding tactics and become clinched,
the referee agreed to separate them.
It was announced that in the event
of a knockdown the official timekeep
er would count off the seconds loud
enough to be heard by both principals,
thus giving the man knocked down
ample time to rise If he could do so
before the prescribed limit had
elapsed.
After the conference Brady met Mrs.
Fitzsimmons, who was .standing out
side of Fits's dressingroom, and they
shook hands. Brady then Joined Jef

FROM THE FIRST
GEORGE SILER. Referee.
BY GEORGE SILER, REFEREE.
NEW YORK, June ;i. â It was the
same old story about fighting
"Fitz," while defeated, \\ -
disgraced He simply met a younger,
nger and faster man. There was
no time during the fight that Fitzsim
mons looked as though !;â¢â¢ could win.
Jeffries outboxed and outfought him
from start t-> finish, having i ;
'. â > ry round. It struck me several
tiir.es during: the fight as though Fitz
simmons thought thf> boiler maker
could not hurt him. He proi
that idea from the fact that "Jim" oc
casionally touched him lightly with the
left. Whenever these blows were de
livered, or, rather, when Fitzsimmons
ived them, he would smile and bore
in. "Jeff" avoided his swings In the
r manner possible.
I thought that from Fitzsimmons 1 ex
perience as a boxer he would land oft
with straight left leads than Jef
fries. This, however, was not so, as
Jeffries countered continually with the.
left and hooked him with his left time
and again without a return. When he
put Fitzsimmons down the first time it
was a straight left-hand counter. The
blow was not a very hard one, but it
happened to catch Fitzsimmons off his
balance and so caught him coming to
ward him. This had the effect of put
ting him down. He remained down but
two seconds, smiling all the time, and
acted as though he considered it a joke.
When he got up he forced Jeffries tÂ«j
the ropes, swinging right and left, but
he failed to land, Jeffries avoiding him
easily. Just prior to the knockdown
Jeffries drew blood, which gave him
first blood and first knockdown. Up to
this time there was no decided advan
tage, "Jim" if anything having a shade.
It looked like anybody's fight when the
men went {â¢ â¢ their corners.
Tommy Ryan from then on began
coaching Jeffries to go for the body
with his right and leave the head
alone; also to keep the left going at
the head with straieht lefts and hooks.

often. Some of course, were very

Walking back to his corner he stood

moments, then sat down and gargled
his throat with a cooling liquid.
Siler, the referee, who quickly fol

Fitzsimmons' seconds were Martin

lected as the club's timing representa

last moment.
After "Fred" Burns, the announcer,
had introduced the men, they peeled off
all unnecessary clothes. Jeffries wore
a breechclout, held in position with a

a belt made of small American flags.
On the left side of the belt was a ro

Fitzsimmons looked at the rosette ad
miringly as he took off his bath robe,
waiting for the signal to begin hostili
ties.
Jeffries again tested the floor of the
ring after having his gloves fixed, took
another cooling gargle and stood wait

body. Fitz also looked tit and bunches
of muscles were rolling all over him.

between Julian and "Bob" before the
Becond dose reached him. and it was
all over but the shouting.
Fltzsimmons was picked up and car
ried to his corner, where he revived in
a few moments and hung his head in
sorrow. Julian appeared broken-heart
ed, and I an) sure the other seconds fell
equally as bad.
After I had counted Fitzsimmons out
I walked over and grasped Jeffries by
the arm and (.resented him to the spec
tators. It was not necessary to sum
mon the announcer to the ring to de
clare the winner, as everybody in the
house knew as well as myself the re
sult.
Jeffries' victory places him on top of
the pugilistic ladder and with nobody
in sight but Sharkey, whom he will
undoubtedly fight. Should he win, he
will without doubt hold the champion
ship for the next ten years.
Jeffries reminded one of McCoy's
stylo of fighting, crouching and keep
ing himself well together, but some of
his swings were very awkward. Al
though Fitzsimmons was bleeding from
the nose in the third round, he stood
well up to his man. When Fitz did
land it was always well within his dls
tance and one could Bee that those blows
all told. Never before had Fitz fought
with forty pounds against him, but he
did not seem to realize that he was
fighting a giant. Jeffries was doing his
best work with his left, but Fitz was a
real two-handed fighter.
In the fifth round Fitz. a little too
hasty, rushed in and slipped and was
fought to one k;ie>'. but was up lik<- a
dash and worked with both hands. In
Fitz' broad BQuare shoulders was tre
mendous hitting powers. Jeffries had
a bad cut on the left eye, but when he
came up for the sixth round it did not
seem to bother him. His towering
form assumed a panther-like crouch,
but Fitz stood up to him so well that
he appeared to get tired and then
adopted the old ring tactics of the
heavier man by trying to hang on to
his lighter opponent. But the rules
under which they fought minimized
this advantage, which under old-time
ring rules would have been allowed.
At 1 1 1 â¢ â  dose of the sixth round it
looked as if Fitz had merely to wait his
chance to land a knockout blow. Fitz'
pose was that of a true fighter and ath
lete, head well back, shoulders straight
and both arms well guarding the face
and body.
The nen were in striking contrast to
each other. Dp to this time the lights
were badly managed, now one and now
the other being at a disadvantage.
Fitz was up for the eighth round and
was titst to lead. He landed a left and

looked as hard as nails. When he got

NEW YORK, June 9.â There is no simi
larity between the Janus Jeffries I saw
attempt to knock out Hob Armstrong at
the Lenox Athletic Club In August
and tin' James Jeffries who put Robert

i Â»ne was a big, soft, painfully slow chap,
that didn't appear to know the first rudi

sparring with Corbeti all through the lat

was the laughing stock of all the K<>"d
judges around the ringside, and not one
man in the building had a complimentary
word for him after his really pitiable
showing.
But time, and little of it, has worked
wonders for this overgrown boy. Last
night he was big. strung, shifty, quick
and scientific. A faster or a more scien

like a battering-ram and took hard blows
in return without flinching. He used the
right and left hand with equal force, both
hands .seemingly being alike to him, and
he wanted to fight all the time.
His footwork was simply a revelation,
his improvement in this respect in less

strength, science, qiuckness of hand, eye

make him a champion worthy of the
title. He should be champion for several
years to come.
Those who remember John L. Sullivan
before and after he fought "Paddy" Ryan
will appreciate the marvelous change in
Jeffries. It was the same with both
menâ fat and slow one month, and Wig,
strong and lightning fast the next.

in this round. Each man laughed at
the other as he went to his corner.
Considering the rapid pace the men
had fought they both answered the bell
in good shape. Jeffries was the first to
show, leading off with the left and scor
ing hard with that member on the nose,
pushing Fitz's head back. Jeff again
sent the left for the jaw. birt failed to
reach the objective point, and Fitz
countered with a right over the heart.
Fitz rushed for the left, missed and
clinched, and the referee had to sepa
rate them. Fitz then swung his right
hard for the jaw, hut his aim was bad
and the blow went wide of the mark.
Jeffries countered with the left heavily
on the nose, drawing blooti from that
member. Fitz rushed and fell short,
and Jeff smashed him hard on the nose,
sending his head back and making him
generally unsteady in his movements.
The Californian repeated this again and
again. As the bell rang Jeffries landed
his right hard over the heart and sent
his left to the nose with force. Fitz
was bleeding freely from the nose at
the conclusion of the round. During
the round he spat up considerable
blood. Fitz was very tired and almost
on the defensive. Jeffries was com
paratively fresh. It was a bad round
for Fitz.
Jeff was on the offensive, sending his
left lightly to the nose. He quickly fol
lowed with a right-hand blow over the
heart and a heavy left on' the jaw,
which made the champion's head rock.
Fitz feinted considerably for a moment,
trying to draw the Californian into po
sition fur a right swing on the jaw, but
the big fellow would not have it and
carefully protected that part of his
head. They then mixed it up and Jeff
landed his left with terrific force on

George Siler in support of my offer
to fight either the winner of to
night's battle or Tom Sharkey, or to
fight Fitzsimmons at 158 pounds for
the middle-weight championship. H.

a purse of $25,000 for Fitzsimmons

both men are holding, the referee go

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1899.
THE CALL GIVES THE FIRST
NEWS OF THE BIG FIGHT
Return of tfye Championship to California Pleases
th)e Multitude Before the Bulletin Boards.
THE victory of Jeffries, which
means the return of the world's
championship to California, was
greeted with the wildest enthu
siasm by an immense concourse
of people on Market street. Before t>
o'clock little knots of people com
menced to gather In front of The Call's
offlde. From tiiat time until five min
utes past 8, when th^ news of Jeffries'
victory was flashed over the wire, the
crowd grew until it formed one com
pact mass of humanity.
Its sympathies were with Jeffries, as
was evidenced by the spontaneous
1 heers whenever the bulletin shown on
the screen favorvd the man from Los
Angeles. In the tenth round the crowd
scented victory for Jeffries. The
news came that he had knocked
Fitzsimmons down, and this sent the
crowd into a perfect frenzy, which was
accentuated when the round ended.
That it was a sporting crowd was evi
dent wh<-n at the opening of the fateful
round the bulletin showed Fitzsimmons
was Btrong and ready to continue. The
crowd applauded the old champion.
The end came so quickly that It took
the spectators unawares, and for one
f instant they seemed unable to
understand. Then there were scenes of
the wildest enthusiasm. Men cheered
until they were hoarse, threw their
hats Into tli" air and shook the hands
of those nearest them. The great,
to come. From my account of to
night's encounter, the crowd Â£"t the
worth of their money. 1 hardly thought
it v. ould last so long.
"But Jeffries look my advice. He
played a waiting game without losing
any chances. He iie;ured out Fitzsim
mons in the first few rounds, then
started In to worry him with that ter
rible left of his.
"It's all over and I'm plart Fitzsim

that a man born in Yankeeland is the
greatesi fighter in the world, and he
is a fight â¢!â¢ that will meet all comers

all the same dose he gave Fitzsimmons
to-night â â :â¢ I miss my guess."

CROWD IN FRONT OF THE CALL OFFICE HEARS THE KJUSULT
I compact mass of humanity commenced
to ravel out at thf ends and was soon
scattered to the four points of the
compass.
The universal expression of opinion
was that Jeffries' ability had from the
first been underestimated. His strength
and youth and enormous vitality were
j too much for Fitzsimmons to overcome.
The champion's absence from the ring
for two years suddenly took on impor
tance, and it was said to be impossible
for him to regain his old condition.
The bulletin service of The Call
proved far superior to that of the other
papers. While they were satisfied with
the ordinary bulletin service, which did
I not come over a direct wire, The Call's
| service was uninterrupted from the
! ringside at Coney Island to the office on
Market street. In addition to being
more in detail and more accurate, it
was a round in advance throughout.
The difference in time between this city
and New York resulted practically in
the fight being finished before darkness
I set in. The Call's stereopticon service
j worked admirably, the canvas being
' visible to the greater portion of the
people on Market street. The bulletins
stood out boldly and could be read
. asily.
The bulk of the money wagered in
this city was placed at odds of ten to
seven, Fitzsimmons being the favorite
at all Hmes. The odds fluctuated
j yesterday from six to seven, going
I backward and forward as the pressure
of money was wagered. The "wise" di-
JOY AT THE NEW
CHAMPION'S HOME
NEW YORK, June 9.â As Jeffries entered the clubhouse with his
managers and trainers the following telegram from his old home, Los An
geles, Cal., was handed to him:
Jim: The hopes and good wishes of papa, mamma, family and a host of
friends po with you into the rin^r. Yon will surely win. PAPA.
LOS ANGELES, June 9.â Los Angeles, the homo <>f "Jim" Jeffries,
champion pugilist of the world, by virtue of his victory over Fitzsiinmons
to-night, is wild with enthusiasm over the result of the bjp tisht. The
principal streets are alive with people who had watched the bulletin boards
and scanned the newspaper extras with interest, and when the news
came that Jeffries won in the eleventh round they broke out into wild
cheers and marched the streets in squads, yelling themselves hoarse for
the new champion of the world.
The betting was li^ht here, at odds of about 10 to 7 in favor of Fitz-
Bimmons.
I vision went down with the champion,
on whom it had won so often.
Joe Rose, the bookmaker, was one of
' the persons who picked Jeffries. In the
fifth round he "hunched" the price to
75 to 100, where it had previously been
60 to 100. Charles L. Fair was a sup
[ porter of Jeffries, sending in a commis
sion of several hundred dollars on the
Californian. Ed Homan liked Jeffries
bo much he laid $350 to $500 on him.
Eugene Van Court was among those
; who could see no one in it but Jeffries.
Eddie Graney, Johnny Humphrey,
i "Spider" Kelly, Tim McGrath and
i "Jim" Neal were among the men who
I could see nothing to it but Fitz.
Harry Corbett handled $47,000 in the
straight betting and $8343 in the mu
tuels. The winning mutuels paid $9 80
on each dollar Invested. Mr. Corbett
sent congratulations to the winner on
his having gained the championship,
I and especially on the fact that it was
again held by a Californian.
The mutuel board shows that Fitz
simmons had more supporters through
out than his youthful adversary. This

CORBETT SORRY
HE WAS NOT IN
JEFFRIES' PLACE
BY JAMES J. CORBETT, EX-CHOMPION OF THE WORLD.
NEW YORK. June 9.â Well, it was a
great fight and the best man won, and
it was the man I always expected
would win. Jeffries has been greatly
underrated, and he has certainly sur
prised a great many sports by his
great fight of to-night. I am, of course,
delighted at the result.
The championship now belongs to an
American â and a Californina at that â
and I'm mighty glad of it.
The only thing that I have to regret
about this contest is that it was not I
who met Fitzsimmons. I never had the
fever to fight as I had to-night. I
know that I am a better man than
either of those in that ring. I don't
want to aay this in a derogatory man
ner to either of them. I think Jeffries
had the better of it from start to fin
ish. The new champion had his
head about him all the time and land
ed better and more often than the
lanky Australian. He went into the
ring full of tlie greatest confidence,
and said to me that the contest would
never go the scheduled twenty-five
rounds.
"I am going to win in half that num
ber," Jim said, and as you see he
proved himself to be a good prophet,
the battle lasting only eleven rounds.
They were good hard rounds, too. and
each man knew he was doing a lot of
fighting. One of them, however, was
getting- the better of it right along, and
that was my friend Jim.
He took a number of punches that to
the onlookers appeared hard, but they
never feased him. He came back to
his corner at the end of each round
wearing a confident smile and said he
felt certain that he was going to be the
winner.
In the first round Jeffries conducted
himself marvelously cool and showed
every indication of a determination to
win." In the second round he went at
his man with greater confidence, and
just before the bell rang he landed a
beauty on Fitz's nose, and down went
the then champion. Fitz came up
quickly, of course, and was at it, fight
ing hard, but I could plainly spp that
he was a bit anxious. The unexpected
had occurred to him. The third round
found Jim fighting strong and landing
right and left. Fitz tried chopping tac
tics with Jim. but the game didn't
work. The boy was too cute for him.
It was a highly interesting mill up to
the very last, but the tenth and elev
enth rounds were peaches. How Jeff
went at his quarry and what stunning
blows he did get in on Fitz: Why, the
old man wasn't in it a little bit! He
would land occasionally, but gracious
me! it was like a man with a tack
hammer trying to knock down a stone
wall. Jeff used fine judgment, espe
cially in these two rounds, and landed
good rights and lefts most effectively.
Th^ result is that he is the iipw cham
pion, and. as I said at the beginning.
I am mighty glad the championship is
once again in the possession of an
American.
COMPARISON OF THE
FIGHTERS' RECORDS
On public form, aa indicated by the rec
ords of the rival fighters, Fitzsimmons
should have won handily. In a fairly busy
ring experience he has but two defeats
marked against him. In one of these
that scored by "Jim" Hall in Sydney,
Australia, in 1890â the ex-champion con
(esses to have lost by agreement. This
has ever been tho blot on his pugilistic
escutcheon, which he would have given
much to efface. It has always made
heavy bettors pause and think before
wagering their money. The other defeat
is fresh in the memory of Californians,
as it was his memorable meeting with
I Sharkey at Mechanics' Pavilion, when
Wyatt Earp was referee.
To offset these defeats the Cornishman
has a long string of decisive victories. His
lirst battle was in December. 1889, wh<-n
he defeated Dick Ellis of New Zealand.
On May 10 of the following year he ar
rived in this city on the Zealandia. A
week later he was tried out by Frank
Allen, then instructor in the California
Athletic Club. On May 29 he won his first
I fight in America, defeating "Billy" Mc
[ Carthy. A month later he-knocked out
Arthur Ut'ham of .\>w Orleans. His next
victory was over "Jack" Dempsey. whom
he finished in thirteen rounds. He defeat

189 ahe fought but once, defeating Al Al
lich.
In ISJW he beat Peter Maher in 1 minute
35 seconds, and lost to Sharkey. Hs
fought Corbett on March IT. 1897, since
which time he has not appeared in the
ring until last night.
Jeffries' career in the ring has been a
short and a merry one. His first fight
was with Dan Long, whom he knocked
nut. In a mix-up â  uh Corbett at Carson,
when he was one of the retinue of train
ers, he was knocked out. Ho whipped Van
Buskirk and Henry Baker; fought a draw
with ilus Ruhlin and another with Jr>o
Choynski; was granted the decision over
Sharkey in a twenty-round bout, and over
Boh Armstrong ten rounds. This, with
last night's battle, which makes him
champion completes the record of his do
ings in the arena.

LURE GAME TROUT
FROM HIS HAUNTS
Fishermen Are Enthusiastic Over the Qual
ity of Sport in Mountain Lakes
and Rivers. '
The fish:- season is on in earnest and i
authorities on the pastime pronounce it !
the most promising ever known here. It
lias opened unusually early and the de
mand for reds, flies and other necessary
I paraphernalia has kept dealers in those j
articles busy. Chief credit for this state j
of affairs is by common consent accorded j
the members of the Fish Commission.
They have stocked rivers and lakes with j
different varieties of trout, and after i
stocking them have seen to their preser
vation un:!l thoy have had time in which I
to develop. As a result the fishermen will
have royal sport in whatever direction j
they may bend their steps.
Walter D. Mansfield advances a theory ;
for the excellence of the fishing on Me- !
Cloud River. He says that owing to cer- i
tain conditions few salmon went up the
McCloud. Where in former > â¢ ars count- j
less thousands went Up the river to spawn j
hardly more than 150 went this year. As i
a consequence there was no spawn upon !
which the trout could feed at the river 'â 
bottom and they are forced to come to I
the surface for feed. That is why they i
take the fly with avidity and inexperi
enced rod wielders land them as readily
as do the veterans.
The season opened at Tahoe on the Ist
Inst. and good sport has been found there. I
The eaten averages from forty to fifty '
pounds of fish per boat a day. In addl- '
tion to the State law, which fix< the i
season during which trout m.i be taken. '
there are local ordinances in El Dorado
and Placer counties. These prohibit fish
ing in Lake Tahoe or its tributaries dur- j
ing April and May. This has had a bene
ficial effect upon the fishing.
Alex Vogelsang, president of the Fish
Commission, left on Wednesday for Yo
semite Valley. He will note the condi
tion of the fishing in the various lakes
which have been thoroughly stocked with
trout. The first fish were sent then- eight i
years ago and marvelous results have !
been attained since then. Great sport is !
expected there during the present season. ;
Attornew W. W. .Foote is in the valley at ;
present and went prepared to enjoy the
fishlne.
H. W. Keller of Santa Monica succeeds
J. M. Morrison of Sacramento as a mem
ber of the State Fish Commission. Mr. \
Keller, who is a man of independent
means, is an ardent sportsman. While a I
resident of this city some years since he !
was president of the Field Trials Club. |

GEORGE WHITNEY STILL CHAMPION
The finals of the class tournament of the
California Tennis Club proved a disap
pointment. The round robin between
Whitney, Bradshaw and Cornell, the re
spective winners of the first, second and
third classes", was devoid of close or in
tf-rt-stlnp tennis. Bradshaw, who gave
Cornell half fifteen, won his match in two
straight sets, G-4, 5-4. George Whitney
played Cornell, giving him odds of half
thirty, ar.d, despite Uiis great handicap,
won easily with the score of 6-3, 6-4. Braa
shaw .md Whitney then met in the last
match of the tournament the latter giv
ing the former odds of half thirty. The
handicap was not big enough for Brad
ehaw, who was defeated by Whitney G-3,
0-4. The result of the tournament shows
Whitney as champion, with Bradshaw as

his visit he sent an eight and a half
pound Dolly Varden trout to a friend
here. This great fish was caught with
minnow bait. He sent also some one and
a half to two and a half pounders, caught
with the fly.
Advices from George Walker and W.
A. Cooper are to the effect that they are
doing well at Simms. Frank Hall is also

small bass in Russian River than ever
before. About 30,000 of them were taken
by the deputies from land-locked water,

mately, and restored them to the river.
The bass develop rapidly. In ISSO 430 -mall
fish were planted there. Last year over
500,000 pounds were marketed in San

used elsewhere. Some were sent north for
planting in Eel River and Humboldt Bay

California, noted, for ihe grand trotters, pacers and thoroughbreds bred within its
borders, has given to the world but few horse* of Â§rea f er promise than Huhla, bred by
./. B. Sprechels. As a four-year-old she. won tin four races in which she started, on the
Eastern circuit, defeating the pick of American t rafters. The following year the in
vincible, all- conquering marc swept all before her wntil the $15,000 free-for-all rice at
Columbian Exposition. After winning two heats she broke down and since then has
never faced a starter. She is the favorite matron at Apt os Stock Farm and great tilings
are expected of her progeny.

THE POISON FIEND
IS AGAIN AT WORK
CHAMPION MONTANA QUEEN, the prize winning St. Bernard bitch, the
property of Mrs. E. F. Beck, is dead, a victim of the poison fiend.
Champion ' Montana Queen was the winner of sixteen first prizes in its
class, and never, notwithstanding its many entries, fell even to second
place. Quern slways carried off the prize. Hence its value. Her owner
has refused $5000 for the animal.
Yesterday morning at 10:30 o'clock Queen, the largest of its hreed on the
coast, was lomping about its mistress in the yard. Five minutes later the
brute was found writhing in agony. Physicians were summoned and found
that the animal wns suffering from strychnine. Antidotes were adminis
tered, but ns Queen did not appear to rally the San Francisco Veterinary
Hospital was communicated with and veterinary physicians hurried to Mrs.
Beck's house. When they arrived, however, the valuable animal was dead.
An autopsy was held, the stomach removed and largo quantities of arsenic
found therein. Mrs. Beck says nhe was warned that jealous persons wiHhr-d
to poison her dog. Consequently she kept it within doors nt night, but did
not think they would dare to throw poison into her yard in daytime. In this
she was mistaken, and in consequence, she has lost her valuable pet.
TRANSMITS SPEED
TO ALL HER PROGENY
Hulda, the Marvelous Race Mare, Bids
Fair to Perpetuate tier Name
in Racing Annals.
Down at Aptos stock farm Hulda, one
time queen among American trotters, is
passing the declining years of her life.
The great race mare is transmitting her
speed and beauty to numerous progeny,
having produced foals by Cupid, McKln
ney and one by Dexter Prince, a suckling
shown in the illustration on this page
Hulda is a bay mare foaled in ISSS and
bred by A. B. Spreckels. She has never
been out of his possession, and. as may
be supposed, is a great favorite with him.
She was sired by Guy Wilkes, 2:lsV*, out
of Jenny, the dam of Oracle S. 2:22. This
.-hows she comes rightfully by her ex
treme speed.
She was tirst raced as a four-year-old,
starting four times that year on the East
ern circuit, and returned here with a rec
ord of 2:ll?4. She won every race in which
she started that year. The next season
was the year of the Columbian Exposi
tion. Orrin Hickok, the celebrated train
er, took her East and she started In four
races. At Buffalo. New York City and
Detroit she met the best horses of the
year and defeated them. At Chicago, In
the Columbian free-for-all, purse or $15,
--000, she met the great champions Alix,
2:03 -;; sPlxlevJ^2;o6H; -Nightingale. 2:08;
Lord Clinton, '2:oÃ%; Walter K. 2:10; Ry
land T. 2:07*, ; Little Albert, 2:10; Green
leaf. 2:10%, and Alvin, 2:11. This was the
celebrated race which- required three days
before It was finished. Alix won the first
heat in 2:07%. Hulda the next two in
2:10 V; and 2:1 'â â¢â _..
Mr. Hickok was certain he would win
the next heat and the race, but Hulda
sprained an ankle In that heat and had to
be drawn. She was never able to race
again. Since then she has been in the
breeding ranks. She whs bred to Search
light, 2:04^, this year. Hulda was one
of the greatest trotters ever bred in Cali
fornia, and Orrin Hickok has always
claimed she would have held the world's
record but for her unfortunate accident.

GOLF FLOURISHES
IN MARIN COUNTY
San Rafae! Club Fully Equipped to
Get All the Pleasure Possible
Out of ths Game.
The San Rafael Golf Club will begin
play to-day upon the first nine holes of
the permanent eighteen-hole course, but
the formal opening will be put off until
later In the summer. All the putting
- -sec! and will be kept In
; excellent condition by frequent watering.
They are from forty to a hundred feet In
â  ter. Instructor J. W. Tetley is reg
ularly engaged In coaching various mem
bers and th< season bids fair to be a most
successful one. The club has a
about 200 members, and has bought
twenty-five acres, upon which it? club
â  stands. For th<- links a trad of
600 acres has been teased fur three years.
Tl â  principal feature of the clubhouse
is a porch sixty feet long and twenty-four
feel deep, running along its entire front
The clubhouse contains a handsome liv
dr< ssing-rooms for men and
women, bathrooms, lockers and quarters
for the housekeeper. The full eighteen
hole course will not be read] I >r .:-â¢ until
winter.
The home-and-home matches between
teams of ladies of the San Francisco and
Oakland yolf clubs have been a good deal
talked of, but bo far nothing has come of
: the talk. The Oaklandtrs blame the S i
Francisco ladies for the delay and the
San Francisco representatives say that
they were all ready but that the Oaldand
irs -lid not come to the scratch. So many
families haw now left the city for the
summer that it is probable the' pr<
matches will not take place for some time.
The Oakland club will issue a summer
programme, and during the month of Au
gust arrangements may be made for a
tournament on the Del* Monte lit b
tween th* San Rafael, Oakland, San Fran
cisco and Burllnsrame clubs.
lii order to Increase the Interest of its
members, the Oakland club keeps a roll
showing the relative standing: of the
players, compiled from the known results
of their games. Bach member bears a
number, and the holder of a lower num
ber may at any time challenge the player
Immediately above himself, and, if he
beats him, takes his place on the roll.
The same player, however, is not liable
t" l>>- challenged more than once In four
weeks unless he chooses. The two play
eighteen holes, match play, and the win-
Ither holds his place or gains a step.
It' the challenged player does not respond
by playing the challenger within two
weeks he forfeits his right and loses one
number, the challenger taking it. A
record of all th< games for pli is to be
kept "ii score cards signed by the players
and handed to the captain. The roll was
at first prepared somewhat tentatively,
bul it will be revised up often as may be
deemed necessary and such changes made
in the conditions as experience may prove
to be most useful In encouraging the
membi rs t< quire a high degree of skill.
The first twenty players in the Oakland
Golf Club, according to their present
standing, are as follows: l, K. v. Folger;
2 c p Hubbard; 3, G. D. Greenwood; -I.

lend a practice barge to the representa

certainly enter. The university has hith
erto paid very little attention to rowing
and ha." not appeared in any public event
since its race some /ears ago with the
Columbia Rowing Club. It will be an
excellent thing for amateur rowing on San
Francisco Hay if tne university will take
up the sport in earnest.

together this season. J. Foley, J. Bogan

barge crews; the "â¢Doc's" lightweight

nature and objects of trusts were not so
id as they arc now. A short time
it was generally believed that trusts were organized
straint of trade and for the purpose of monopoliz
ertain lines of industry and raising prices to
rs. It is row known that the effects of trusts
â  opposite of what was feared
trade, but so extended it that
our manufacturers are now sending American
products to all parts of the world. It has not checked
-?ry. but stimulated it. and has not raised hut
lowered prices for all classes of consumers.
The original opposition to trusts was not one of
party politics, nor is it such to-day. A Republican
gress enacted the anti-trust law now on the Fed
>ks, and Republican Legislatures, as
well as Democratic Legislatures, have attempted to
prevent or restrict the operation of trusts within State
lines. In fact, Senator Depew has recently stated that
all p rties will in iqt.-o make ami trust planks
prominent in their political platforms. Such planks
will mean that men of all parties are in favor of
king any abuses that may arise from the opera
tion of great combinations of capital, and Bryan's ef
fort to make party advantage out of public sentiment
on the subject will fail. The issue will not be a par
tisan one next year any more than it was four j
ago, nor is it likely the people will be much excited
over it, despite the laborious efforts of Democratic
leaders to work it Up for campaign purpo-cs.
It is worth noting that the stringent anti-trust law
enacted by Arkansas has been recently declared by
the courts to be fatally defective, but not untii it had
done great injury to the State. It had the effect of
driving the great insurance companies out of the com
monwealth, and for several months millions of dol
lars' worth of property went uninsured. The new
Texas law on the subject treats all transactions in
which a tru^t is concerned very much as if it were
gambling, and is about as stringent as any law that
can be devised. The effect there is very apt to be what
it was in Arkansas. Modern economic development
has made large combinations necessary to meet the
intense competition of trade, and States that do not
permit them are sure to suffer heavy losses in more
ways than one.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1899.
MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION WORK
THE current number of the Merchants' Associa
tion Review is mainly devoted to reports of the
fifth annual meeting, but there are papers on
other topics showing the interest taken by the
association iv the general welfare of the city. Two
of these are of notable excellenceâ one dealing
with the question of providing playgrounds tor chil
and the other recommending the adoption oi
irfs of flushing the sewers with salt water.
Tt is pointed out that in this city there were ar
rested last year upward of 800 boys, most of them for
such ; is of the law as flying kites or playing
ball upon the streets, fi is believed it would be com
easy to provide playgrounds that would
give room to the youth of the city for healthful exer
eisc. and thus put an end to the necessity for such
arrests. In Eastern cities, where places for recrea
tion have been established, the good%esults have far
outstripped expectation and afford strong induce

city squares are now hardly more than lounging
places for tramps, and that parents do not feel at all
safe in permitting their children even to cross them.
Many of them, it is argued, could .vith public advan

A j ociation will confer
with the California Club as to the best means of pro

perhaps not far distant when San Francisco will not
be behind any city of the Union in providing play

gardens or yards of their own.

It is clear that San Francisco Democracy will never
get rid of the incubus until it upsets the cart and spills
the load into the nearest ditch. Nothing less than
such drastic- tactics will avail anything. Kicking on
the part of the donkey is of no effect, for the one
hundred is safely perched out of reach of t lie kicks.
While the cart holds together the committee will keep
its piace. It can be turned out only by a complete
dump or a h up.

The original committee of three was to perform
a specific duty and end its career with the fulfillment
of that duty. It appointed a committee of one hun
dred to perform the duty and then disband. The
specific duty was never performed either by the three
or by the one hundred. It never will he performed.
The committee is carrying out a continuous perform
ance through the years, but the act originally an
nounced as its specialty has been dropped from the
programme, and even the most sanguine and patient
spectator of the circus must long since have lost hope
of ever seeing it
The new campaign has hardly opened yet. and the
Democratic don! ej has still a chance to rid himself
of his burden before the heat of the day begins.
There is very little hope for him, however. In fact,
if he should manage to get sense enough to break
away from the incubus, he would be a donkey no
longer, and therefore no San Francisco Democrat.
Dreyfus seemed to think that he could gain no
dignity by resuming the captain's uniform of which
conspiracy robbed him. Since he changed his mind
his supporters seemed to think that he sacrificed
something of his self-respect and won nothing in
compensation.
The Chief of Police of New York says that the first
heavy blow struck in the Fitzsimmons-Jeffries "box
ing contest" will end the affair. Roth of the big pugi
lists entertain the same hope, but for an altogether
different reason.
Dreyfus is fairly embarked now on his way to
France, fty the time he reaches Brest the general
j staff of the French army will have taken to the

COL, KELLOGG
COMPELLED TO
RETURN HOME.
He Relinquished Con.
mand at Honolulu.
General Shatter returner! from Bakers*
j fiekl yesterday morning and spent the â  â¢.â¢
at rlepartment headquarters. One of ii;s
callers was Colonel Ertgar R. Kellogg ofV
the Sixth Infantry, who returned from'
Honolulu on th( Doric. It will be remem
bered that only a short while ago Colonel
Kellogg sailed from here in command of
the Sixth Infantry. At the time he had
been advised by his physician that i,.*
would be unable to stand the life in the
! Philippines, but he was hopeful that the
sea voyage might rl.> him good. After
leaving San Francisco he was taken i
| with malaria, and when he reached Hono
\ lulu he was advised by the surgeons of
the regiment that if he continued the trip
; he would do .so at the risk of hLs life.
. Colonel Kellogg Is only one of the many
American officers who have had their con
: Btitutions undermined by disease contract
. Ed in the Cuban campaign. At that tim.j
be was lieutenant colonel of the Tenth
Infantry nd served through the trying
| times around Santiago with gallantry and
. distinction. While in Cuba he contracted
malaria and another dreaded disease,
from which he has never been able to rid
himself. Colonel Kellogg has been advised
: that he will have to take a long rest be
fore he can ever hope to again report
i for duty. He expects to go to San ]>iego,
where he will be joined by his family.
Colonel Hogg is greatly disappointed
that he was not able to go the Philippine^
and share the fortunes of his command.
The remains oi First Lieutenant Jacob
H. G. Lazelle, Eighteenth Infantr-,-, who
died on one of the transports last year
while en route to the Philippines, were
interred in the cemetery at the Presidio
yesterday with full military honors. Lieu
tenant Lazelle was the first American offi
cer to die on a transport. The funeral
I took place at 1 o'clock. The band of the .
, Twenty-fourth Infantry played the fu- -^
neral march. A detail from Company G,
Twenty-fourth Infantry, under the com
mand of First Lieutenant H. B. Nelson,
acted as the escort. All the officers sta
tioned at the post, with three companies
from the Twenty-fourth Infantry and
four troops of the Fourth Cavalry, formed
the cortege, Lieutenant Lazelle was a
son*of Colonel Lazelle of the army. The
following officers acted as pallbearers:
Captain J. C. Castner, Fourth Infantry;
First Lieutenant H. L. Laubach, Twenty
third Infantry; First Lieutenant E. L 5.

Captain Robert H. Noble* acting- in
spector general and aid upon the staff of
General Shatter, has been detailed to in
vestigate the charges preferred by Cap
tain Batchclor of the Twenty-fourth In
fantry against Chaplain Bateman at Fort
Spokane. The captain alleges thai the
chaplain tried to usurp authority over his
troops and replied in an insolent manner
to him. A court-martial may be the result
of the investigation, but it will be very
unusual for a chaplain to have to appear
before a court.

Rates In Pan Joaquln and Xapa val
leys and in Southern California are un
changed from the old schedule, as the
Commissioners hold that rail and water
competition from those points has al
ready reduced the tariff far below ex
isting rates, or any rates suggested, for
that matter.
No attention whatever was paid to
the La Rue schedule, the preamble to
the resolution merely repealing all
tariffs row In force and establishing
the new rates. The preamble reads as
follows:
It is hereby resolved and ordered
By adopting this schedule and order
ing it Into effect at "nee the board
from the predicament it was
placed in by Its action in repealing the
resolution of the previous board pro
viding for a new schedule, afterward
adopted and known as th~ La Rue
schedule, but n<>t repealing the
schedule itself. Attorney General Ford
was expected t<> render an opinion to
the board yesterday as to whether the
"L.t Rue schedule is new in full effect,
but he did not do so, and by the clause
repealing '"all tariffs in force" there is
no longer any necessity for such an
iplnli m.
The question is of vital importance to
farmers, though, for if the La Rue
schedule went Into effect after the dis-
I solution of the injunction restraining
the old board from enforcing it. the
Southern Pacific is liable to heavy
damages for every overcharge it has
made for shipping grain. But yester
day's action places the matter in such
shape that the only way it will ever bÂ»
st-ttled is for some shipper who has
been compelled to pay the old rate to
bring suit for damages for overcharge,
' pany permission to build the so-called
corkscrew road and also to change the
motive power of the Post-street line to
electricity and to extend it down Mont
gomery street fmm Post to Jackson. All;
of the members *f the dub are property
owners or business men whose interests
ar.- centered in the district below Mont
gomery street ar;d north of Market, and ;
they say they are anxious that the pro
privileges be granted, believing ;
that the improvements would prove bene- 1
ficlal to property In the district.
Somp of the rnemb- rs stated that they i
had called upon the officials of the rail
way company and had been assured that
the company will consent to build the i
< . rkscrew road down Post street fn>m
Taylor Instead "f down Geary, as peti-
I fur. Their only conditions were i
that the connecting franchises which are
asked fur In order t<> make the line con
tlnuous shall be granted for a period of
thirty-seven years, a period representing
the life of the existing franchises. Also
tl.at they be permitted to use overhead
wires Instead <'f the underground system
'â f electricity. Mr. Crocker told the nnm
bera of the club, so they stated, that un
less these privileges were granted, he
v.iii ld never consent that the Market
' street Railway Company build another :
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1893.
by the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners of the State of California that
all tariffs in force, fixing or estab
lishing rates for the transportation
of straight or mixed carloads of
grain, bran, shorts, middlings, feed,
ground, cracked or rolled barley and
cracked corn in sacks, between San
Francisco, Oakland wharf. Port
Costa, Crockett, Nevada dock,
South Vallejo, Stockton, Sacramento,
Marysville, Los Angeles, Port Los
Angeles, San Pedro and stations here-
Angeles, San Pedro and stations here-
RATE IN EFFECT JANUARY 1, 1899.
1 and In that way obtain a decision of
court.
A resolution was adopted by which
Stockton was given 50 cents differential
over Port Costa. The Southern Pacific
wanted the differential reduced t<> 80
cents, but the board acceeded to Stock
ton's request.
After the grain Bchedule had been
adopted, the following resolution was
offered and passed by the votes of
Laumeister and Blackstock, Edson op
posing it :
That the services of nil spe
cial counsel for this hoard be ami the
. dispensed with, and the
A.tt irhey General ttt the State is hereby
requested to take exclusive charge and
management of all legal questions and
proceedings pertaining to said b'Â«ard and
. the affairs thereof.
A certified copy of the resolution was
ordered served on Attorney General
Ford and Robert Y. Hayne and W. YV.
Foote, the two latter having been em
! ployed as special counsel for some time
past
The board then adjourned until next
Monday, but before the members had
left the office they were called back,
I the motion to adjourn rescinded and on
motion of Commissioner Blackstock,
seconded by Laumeister, the following
! resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Santa Fe. San Joa
j quin Valley and California Northwestern
roads, by their representatives, art- here
j by ordered to appear before this commis-
I sion at its next meeting and show cause
foot of street r.illwav in San Francisco.
Mayor Ehelan told the members of the
club "that he saw ho particular objection
to granting the privileges ami franchises
I asked for provided the interests of the
| entire community were protected. He
i pointed out that the Post-street lino runs
! through a very nice risidence portion of
thr ''My and that overhead trolley wires
'â â  would make the streets unsightly. Added
Ito this v.as the objection to overhead
wires in the business district on account
; of their hindrance to firemen in fighting
fires. He Bald that so fa. as he was ln
i formed the chief objection to an under
ground system was the added expense In.
i putting and keeping in repair an under
ground conduit. This, he said, could not

son that the present cable conduit will
'â â  serve the purpose for underground wires.
In regard to the percentage of receipts
that rould be demanded of the railway
' company In return for the desired prlvl
ltge the Mayor said tie believed there was
nothing In the law to prevent the Board "f
Superlvsors from fixing the amount at a
figure that would be In accordance with
the provisions of the new charter.
The property owners replied that they
did not care what conditions were exact) d
provided they did not prove to be pro
hibitory. They needed the road, they said,
and they held It to be their right that
their wishes and the demands of the large
business district should be heeded by the
! legislative and executive branches of the
| municipal government.
At the- conclusion of the conference the
Mayor and the. minority members 0( the
board held an executive session for the
I purpose of outlining the stand they will
; take relative to the privileges under con
sideration. They all expressed the belief
! that it would be well to gr:mt the privi
leges asked for, subject, however, to cer
tain restrictions. Chief among this.- is
, tin question of overhead wires. All were
agreed that an underground system
(mould be used. The Mayor said that he
would telegraph to New York for particu
lars as to the cost of the underground sys
tem as compared with rverhead wires.
Further consideration of the matter was
postponed pending the receipt of the do
sired Information.
Town Talk.
Decidedly the best of the weeklies this
week is Town Talk, the striking feature
of which is a story which will interest
everybody, but particularly those nu;n
who were on the stock board in the early
seventies. The story is called "The Quick
and the Dead," and the scenes are laid
here and In Paris. . Louis A. Robertson
contributes a striking poem, and the
Court Reporter has some' line stork's
about City Hall people In his World if
Law. The dramatic department contains
some strong critiques; Willard Batcheld r
talks about "good things" in pupils; Al
fred Metzger writes entertainingly of mu
sical matters, and Mary Frances Franda
tells where the local songbirds have flown
for the summer. The Saunterer depart
ment'absolutely brims over with exclu
sive news, related in lively language,
about people one knows in the swim and
at the clubs. World of Letters and edi
torials include a readable number. â¢

For a Chinese Hospital.
At a meeting of the Health and Police
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
held yesterday afternoon, the committee
agreed to grant permission for the es
tablishment of a Chinese hospital at 82S
inafter named on the Southern Pa
cific Company's system of railroads
in California be and the same are
hereby abrogated, rescinded and re
pealed; and that it is hereby further
resolved and ordered that the follow
ing be and the same is hereby fixed
and established as the tariff or
schedule fixing and establishing the
rates for the transportation of grain
pr ' other articles above mentioned
c id lines between the stations
1 nafter named as follows:
! why the grain rates adopted by those
roads should not be made to conform to
the rates promulgated for the Southern
Pacific Company.
This resolution is harmless on its
face, bujt it is said to contain a joker
of huge proportions. When the Valley
road was In a position to bid for busi
ness Tt adopted a Krain schedule far
below the regular rate, thereby cutting
deeply Into the Southern Pacific's most
profitable business, in order to haul
: any grain from the Ran Joaquin Valley
i the Southern Pacific had to meet this
â cut, which amounted to something over
j 20 per cent, or more than double the
i reduction made by the schedule adopt- Â»
! ed yesterday.
It Is asserted by railroad men that ,
' the order is made for the ourpose of
forcing th* j se competing roads to aban-
I don their own schedules and advance :
grain rates to tht- limit laid down by
the new tariff. This would enable the '
Southern Pacific to do the same and '
the farmers who have enjoyed the
blessings of real competition for the
past two or three years w..uld again
have tn suffer. This explanation si ma
; entirely probable in view of the fact
: that no change whatever was mad" in
thÂ»' old rates wherever there is active
competition.

new and old rates from the principal
shipping points throughout the State,
excepting where there are no changes

SAX FRANCISCO. June 9. 1599.
Editor The Call: Will you have the
kindness to insert In your issue to-mor
row the Inclosed letter addressed to the!
â¢ â 'lit..r of the Chronicle, and which you j
will lind to be self-explanatory:
GARRET W. McENERNET.
SAX FRANCISCO, June 9, 1599.
To the Editor of the Chronicle; The ar
ticle on the twelfth page of th>- Chron
icle to-day, beaded "Garret McEnerney
Named by Rainey as the New Bourbon
is without foundation in fact.
i am not now, nor have J ever been, nor;
will I ever be, an active politician, a boss
politician, a political leader, a disburser
of political patronage or a seeker alter
political preferment. J am an attorney,
engaged in the proper upholding of such
causes as I believe are right and honor- !
able, and have no other ambition except '
tv continue to hold the good "pinion of:
those of my fellow-citizens who have I
honored me with their friendship and con
fidence.
1 have not taken the interests of the!
Fire Department into my charge, nor!
have 1 any wish to shape the policy of :
the Democratic party, whether State or
l"i al.
The gentleman responsible for the arti
cle in your paper was misinformed.
J have sent a copy of this letter to the i
other newspapers for publication. Yours !
very truly,
GARRET W. McE NE I iKE Y.
The Btory published in a city paper
yesterday that Samuel Rainey had abdi
cated as a boss and transferred the teins
of bossism to Garret McEnerney is prob- i
ably correct as far as Rainey is con
cerned, but is wrong in its application to'
Mr. McEni rney. The politicians who i
know what is going on behind the .-â¢
: doubt very much whether Rainey has
any power or privileges in the line of i
bossing to transfer. Buckley maintains
with a Rood deal of earnestness and !
frankness tha; Rainey never was any
thing more than a messenger boy for the
real and tnii- boss.
It is known to the insiders that Mayor
111-l an became greatly alarmed a few
weeks before election day last fall, and to
make his calling and election sure invited
the assistance of Rainey. After the com- j
bine Rainey was expected to handle cer
tain Interests, and above all was appoint
ed i" bring the Fire Department Into line.
I As the campaign progressed Phelan and ,
I others were convinced! to their surprise,
! that Rainey's influence was nut anything
like as powerful as it was represented to !
be.
bince the election last November
ey has been posing to the outsiders
as a doss upon wh great responsibil
ity for Democratic party management
devolved, but Buckley and Phelan are
not deceived regarding the measure of
Big Sam's power. As the time is near at
hand lor a showdown at the primaries,
: Rainey pÂ« rceives that he cannot con
trol the lir.- Department, even with the
assistance of Chief Sullivan, so in order
to retire from th.- field with some di
..f prestigi : â¢ pi : ses to abdicat
transfer Mis undefined strength to Mr.
McEnerney. The trick of naming a suc
cessor was a !ittl>- clumsy inasmuch as
the designated .successor was not con
sulted. Mr. McEnerney is too bright to
â¢be taken in by tin- Rainey ruse, hence
another man must be appointed to bear
the burden which the Fire Department
i boss is ready, to lay down.
There is a ae&J ol conjecture regarding
th.- relations between Rainey and A. M.
Lawrence. It is suspected by friends of
Phelan in the Committee of One Hundred ;
> that Rain< y has been deriving comfort
and promise of aid fp>m Lawreifce.
The Democrats of the Thirty-third Dis
trict have organized a club at th*
Potrero and elected D. J. Lucey president
and Hugh O'Hara secretary.

BARK HESPER SIGHTED WITH

wrecked, in latitude 30.37 north,
longitude 127.44 east, near Guam.
The Hesper left Port Townsend on !
the 9th of March with a cargo of ur- j
her for China. When in the vicinity I
nf the I^adrone Islands a hurricane was j
encountered and the vessel was thrown t
on her beam ends. Her deckload was
phifted and great damage was done to i
the rigging and hull by the terrible ;
waves that swept her fore and aft. The
main rail, stanchions and bulwarks ;
were carried away. The vessel was
practically waterlogged, and for twelve

POPE DEFEATS

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, June 9.â lt seems a secret con
sistory is appointed for June 19 and a
public consistory for June 22. The con
eistory is one of the most important of
the centuryâ it is the most decisive one
of Leo's XIII's reign. When the opera
tion for cyst was performed on the holy
father the German-Austrian - Quirinal
group held its "council of Pisa" to have a
Pope in favor of reaction come out of the
coming conclave. The Pope's illness
eeems to have torn away the last veils
that covered the conspiracy. Germany
had even sent to Rome an active agentâ
a man who is in Italy called contemptu
ously "Fatigone" (a man who does work).
Ever since IS?2 this extraordinary agent
of the allied governments, this montrond
of prctestant imperialism and the reac
tionary royaUsxn of Italy, has been pre
paring the false step of the triple alliance.
Groups of obedientsâ German, Austrian,
Hungarian. Quit stâ have received or
ders to conform to his actions. Embassies
at Rome have been trusted with the
secret also. To detach the Papacy from
France and Russia, to prepare the way
for a reconciliation between the Vatican
and the Quirinal, but, since the Cardinals
can hardly sign the abdication of the holy
see, to. limit his action provisionally, the
abolition of the electoral "npn expedit" to
break with the democratic, republican and
socialist tendencies of the holy father, to
force the highest moral power of the
world into tru- reactionary orbit of the
triple allianceâ such is the plan.
While Leo Mil was 111 the scheme was
disclosed. The indiscreet participants
begged for votes and aid everywhere.
Leo XIII was on the watch, and to-day
this crime of Ham is punished. He is go
ing to say to those about him, with an elo
quent smile:
"The Cardinals have made ready for the
conclave; we will prepare the consistory."
Here it is. It is impressive. The Holy
Father will create in it twelve Cardinals:
of Mgr. Ciasca, secretary of the Propa
ganda- Mgr. Mathieu, Archbishop of Tou
louse; Mgr. Missla. Archbishop of Goritz;
Mgr Casanova, Archbishop of Santiago
in Chile; Mgr. Richelmy, Archbishop of
Turin: Mgr. Portnova, Archbishop of
Reggio in Calabria; Mgr. Francica-Navadi
Bontife, Archbishop of Catania and Apos
tolic Nuncio at Madrid; Mgr. Casali d<l
Drago, Patriarch of Constantinople and
Vicegerent of Rome; Mgr. Cassetta, Pa
triarch of Antioch, Assessor of the Holy
Inouisition: Father Vives de Llevan< ras,
a Spanish Capuchin definator of his order
and consulter for several Roman congre
gations: Father Cormier, a French Do
minican. Procurator General of his order
at Rriine.
With the exception of Monsignnr Missia.
it will be noticed no new Cardinal can be
considered obedient to the triple alliance.
They are all "Leo and Rampolla" men.
Most of them are determined personal
friends of the Illustrious Secretary of
State. The German Quirinal faction sinks
to the rank of a very small minority. At
the last moment there will be a stampede
in the party of reaction.

Death in an Avalanche
on White Pass.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June News was
brought by the steamer Amur, which
reached here this evening, of another
disastrous landslide on White Pass. I.he !
avalanche which brought Instant death
to one man and serious, perhaps fatal, in
juries to several others, occurred on the
afternoon of Sunday last, just prior to
the departure of the steamer.
A gang of men was at work on the
White Pass and Yukon Railway line just
over â¢ he summit, when a terrible .slide of
rocks and snow came down the mountain
side, carrying death and destruction. At
the time the Amur sailed the names of
tht. dead and injured were not obtainable.
The slide came down with practically
no warning, arid before the men cuuld get
out of its course the rocks and snow were
upon them. Others of the gang were
working a .-hurt distance away and, hear
ing the noise of the slide and the cries,of
the Injured for help, at once rushed to
their assistance and with other willing
assistants soon had them extricated, but
one . man was already dead and two
others, it is feared, cannot livÂ«.
Dr. Whiting, surgeon of the railway
company, who was summoned, says that
the backs of the, two more seriously in
jured men seem to be broken. Everything
possible is being done for the injured men.
More slides are hourly expected, and
men nave been set to watch the hills
above the line for several miles above tha
summit to give warning.
News has reached Skaguay of the
drowning of three adventurous gold seek
ers, who. when the channel was first cut

DR. H. STANGENWALD
DIFS AT HONOLULU
In Lines of Scientific Research He
Was Far Ahead of the
Times.
HONOLULU, June 12.-Dr. H. Stangen
i wald, one of the oldest inhabitants of
Honolulu, passed away early yesterday
morning. He was 70 years of age and a
native of Dresden, Germany.
Dr. Stangenwald was constrained to
leave the old for the new world under
stress of. the political weather of IS4S in
Europe. It was the same tempest as that
which wafted Carl Sohurz to the shores of
America. He studied medicine in Vienna
and was a surgeon in the Frusso-Hunga-
I rian war. Arriving in New York in good
j time to catch the gold fever, he sailed
around the Horn and sojourned in Cali
; fornia a short time. In lSiiO he started a
1 photograph gallery.
Late in the '50s Dr. Stajigenwald went
back to Vienna to further perfect himself
'â  in medical science. Returning, he ouened
an ollice in Hawaii, and along with the
practice of medicine conducted scientific
laboratory investigations. He was in ad
vance of the world in electro-magnetism,
having actually discovered the storage
battery before It was heard of abroad.
It used to be, more than now, the cus
tom of the natives to give men of a.iy
prominence a nickname. That they be
stowed on Dr. Stangenwald. was "Kauka
Mlnukeole," meaning a doctor who does
! not take a minute to cure.
Shortly after his arrival here the second
time Dr. Stangenwald married Mis 3 Mary
Dimond, a sister of General Dimond of
â  San Francisco. By this union there wore
throe children, all of whom came to un
timely deathsâ one from accidental poi
soning, b second by drowning and the
third of convulsions. Losing this wife the
doctor married Miss Anne Dimond the
I younger sister of the former. She sur
vives him.

NEW YORK, June 9.â The proposition
that Irish-Americana of New York City,

' Killarney and present them to the king
dom of Ireland has met with spontaneous
approval from Irish-Americans in Greater
New York.
President James J. Googan of the bor
ough of Manhattan has been untiring In
his efforts to bring the undertaking to a.
reality. He has talked with many noted
Irish-Americans, who have materially
signified their willingness to make Muck
ross Abbey and Killarney an Irish-Ameri
can national park. These subscriptions
have been made;
Richard Croker, $2500.
; "William R. Grace, $1000.

Nearly every district leader of Tain
â  many Hall has bound himself to collect
j $2000 In his. district for the purchase of
j the lakes.
\ James Boothby Roche, who has been
visiting this city and Canada, and who
I as a member of Parliament from the dl
. vision in which the Lakes of Killarney
are situated, is heartily in favor of the
; project. li<s called on Mayor Van Wyck
â¢ to-day, and also met Clerk Blake of "the
1 Board of Aldermen and President Goo
. gan. The plan was discussed, and Mr.
- Roche said later that he had called to
; confer with President Googan aft re- I
i ceiving a cable message from his con
stituents In East Kerry, who had learned
â¢ of the plan suggested, and who were anx
, ions to know if such a project were feas
â  lble.
Michael Davitt had also cabled to Mr.
Roche to look into the matter, as he
i thought it would prove of untold profit
to tourists and to the people of Ireland.
Mr. Roche said that he held an option
1 on the McKross estate, and that if the
matter were taken up at once he could
obtain it for $130,000 and not $150,000, as
previously stated.
The Standard Insurance Company of
Scotland holds a mortgage of $100,000 on
the property, and if need be will accept
$30,000 in cash and take a mortgage for
the balance. An officer of the Standard
, Insurance Company is a tenant of Mc-
Kross, and he charges a fee to all tourists
visiting the place.
Mr. Roche said that if the park plan
proved a certainty, he had in mind a

PLEASURE
TRIP ENDS
IN DEATH
Catamaran Wave Sinks in
the San Joaquin River
Near Stockton.
SOME LOSS OF LIFE
Over a Score of Young Persons
Precipitated Into the Stream's
Swift Current.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 10.â News reached
this city shortly after midnight that .
! the catamaran Wave, bearing a party ;
! of pleasure-seekers on a cruise up the
| San Joaquin River, had been sunk at
a point about ten miles from the city.
I The report created intense excitement,
the first announcement sent by tele
phone from the scene of the disaster be
ins to the effect that at least half of
the party had lost their lives. Later j
reports indicate that most, if not al, of j
; those aboard reached the shore at
points lower down the stream. It will ;
I be impossible for several hours to learn
â  the full extent of the disaster, as there
seems to be a disposition on the part
of the survivors of the wreck to report i
as saved each person inquired for â  by j
anxious relatives, this being done to
allay the excitement in this city.
The following were known to be
| aboard the catamaran: The three ;
Misses Martins, daughters of D. P. |
Martin, who are reported drowned,
Ozro Atwood, Marian Walsh, Hazel
: Klench, Gertie Lang, Alva Atwood,
i Harry White. Samuel Rhodes, Clarence !
! Hall, Adele Shepherd, Ralph Yardley,
George Folger, Herbert Kenyon, Mabel
Kafitz, George Holman, Lloyd Woods,
Hattie Nicewonger. Mabel Ager, Archie j
Atwood, Edith Adams, Mrs. Stella K.
Smith (chaperon). Mrs. Carey Nice
wonger, Bessie Walsh, Bertha Martin,
Ethel Martin, Bessie Smith, Golden
Smith.
The Wave capsized in the San Joa- .
quin River near the old chicory factory,
precipitating a score of well known
young people Into the swift current. At ,
3 o'clock the first reports had been con
siderably modified, but undoubtedly \
lives have been lost.
The means of communication to the
point of the disaster cannot be obtained
direct, and as a consequence nothing
will be known definitely until parties
now hurrying in launches and car
riages to the scene shall have reported. '
Clarence Hall, one of the party which
numbered about twenty-two young j
people, telephoning to The Call cor- j
respondent, says that while a large,
I number reached the bank it is impossi- j
ble to tell just what proportion of those j
I saved are of the original party.
'. He described the disaster as one of
' the most terrible experiences that could
fall to the lot of a pleasure party.
The pleasure-seekers left this city
early last evening, going to the chicory
factory, where they had luncheon.
After spending a pleasant evening they
boarded the catamaran for the return
trip. They had been under way but a
few minutes when the catamaran gave
a lurch, and before any one realized
what had happened the boat "turned
turtle" and every member was thrown
into the water.
Terrible confusion ensued. It was j
very dark and the current was running
swiftly. The river was lined by timber
i and it was hard even for good swim
' mers to obtain a footing. The current i
, carried many down the river and their
screams added to the excitement.
For this latter reason It is hard to
tell just who is saved or who is lost,
as ( many may have got ashore far-
I ther down the river. The first report \
I stated that fully twelve were drowned,
j but several of these have been account
ed for.
The parents of those in the party
i were notified as soon as possible and
j they vainly endeavored to get some
word from the scene of disaster. Those
at the telephone gave them all the hope !
possible, but in some instances it was
1 qualified, and it may be that the in- â 
! tention was to avoid giving the worst !
j news.
Sheriff Sibley has gone overland with ;
i a party of doctors and every available
J hack has been pressed into service by
I persons hurrying across country. Clar- :
i ence Hall gave evasive answers when
I asked about several members of the ,
party, and it seemed he did not want j
to tell how bad the catastrophe was. !
The party was made up of members |
of the Club PAllegria and the two |
chaperones were Mrs. Stella Smith and j
Mrs. Carey Neicewonger. The pleas
j ure trip had been planned to take ,
| place on the catamaran Wave as far ;
up the San Joaquin River as Brandt's
Ferry and return. The craft was taken
above the ferry for some distance and
| was on the return when the accident
I occurred. Of those who were saved
! there was none who could tell how
the accident was caused.
The craft seemed to turn partially
over and sink almost in an instant. The I
members of the pleasure party or most j
of them were on deck, though it is im
| possible that all of them were there.
, All were soon in a struggle for life in
the waters.
All those who succeeded in getting
to the shore were cared for by the fam
! ilies of Messrs. Bonoman and Brandt. â 
1 The young ladies were kept comfortable
while the young men secured dry cloth
, ing and started hack for the scene of
the accident, expecting to find others
alive there.

REPUBLICANS WILL
NOT PULL CHESTNUTS
A Meeting of the Supervisors
to Be Held Monday.
Three in the Minority Tired of Doing Demo
cratic Politicsâ The Gas Rate
Question.
THE question of gas rates is rapidly
assuming the character of a de-ad
lock, and out of it all will probably
come the solution of the problem of
board meetings. The Mayor and his five
Supervisors met three representatives of
the Pacific Gas Improvement Company
in the executive office yesterday; the ul
timatum of the city was delivered and the
answer of the company was demanded.
The company was given until this even
ing to accept or reject the terms, and the
threat of the Mayor was that unless the
terms offered by himself and the minority
were accepted he would refuse to call a
meeting next Monday, and the company
could searcli elsewhere for its money.
The representatives of the company re
fused the terms at the meeting yesterday,
and it is hardly possible they will recon
sider to-day. They will undoubtedly re
fuse again ar.d the meeting for Monday
will not be called.
There are other forces working, how
ever, and it may turn out that there will
be a meeting after all. In the minority
are three Republicans, and while they
have stayed with the minority on all
questions of principle, they are not will
ing to pull Democratic chestnuts from
the fire to the detriment of the city's busi
ii. bs. There are other things on the cal
endar of the Supervisors besides gas
rates, and while the throe Republicans
are Bteadfast in the course they have
adopted on the question of franchises, the
one which raised all the trouble, they wi'l
hardly hold out against meeting now that
the fate of the franchises has been prac
tically settled by the splitting of the ma
jority which favored them. Unless the
circumstances of the controversy change
materially before the time fur meeting
nn Monday, the threi Republicans will
join in the session and will transact such
business as is necessary and urgent.

Rails for Street Railway.
HONOLULU. June 2.â An order poes
forward In the Doric's mail for fifteen
miles of steel rails for the electric street
railway system of the Honolulu Rapid
Transit and Land Company. Under an
option procured by Manager C. G. Ballen
tyne while in the States last fall $30 000
is saved in this it^m from the present high
rise in the iron market.
Pacific Company's contract; the Pacific
Company has to depend on the general
fund, and if the bills are allowed to go
over so long the general fund will be ex
hausted and the company will lose an
other big sum. In view of these facts,
which were explained to the minority, the
representatives of the company agreed to
accept the rate of $1 35, but in doing so
they intimated to the Mayor that after
this month the company wished to dis
continue its service.
But the acceptance of the company was
atisfactory :â > the minority; there
were certain conditions auendant upon
their term?, and the principal one of these
was that in acepting the rate of $1
from the city the company should agree
that thÂ«- same rate would hold good for
the general consumers. This the repre
sentatives refused to consider. It was
pointed out that the consumers' rates are'
already the subject of a .suit in the civil
courts, and the company would not jeop
ardize the position it had taken there by
making any terms with the Supervisors.
It was urged besides that the rates to the j
city were based upon a definite contract, j
which was admitted to be still in force.
The Supervisors came up a little after
that and raised their stipulation on con- i
.sumers' rates to $1 40. The representatives i
again refused, and then it was that the i
Mayor told them they could take it or not.
The answer must be in to-night, and if it ,
is unfavorable or if there be no answer, ,
the Mayor declared there would be no
meeting 1 Monday.
There will be a meeting, however, unless
all the signs fail. It may be too that the
meeting will have to recognize the con- ;
tract of the gas company and will have to â¢
allow It, and the refusal of the minority to <
accept a compromise of $1 35 will cost the
city a tidy sum. As for the consumers
rates, it is prohabie that when the case j
i omes up the company will offer a reduc
tion of from $l 60 to $1 si), and that the
matter will be settled on that basis.
After the departure of the representa- >
tives of the gas company the minority j
and the Mayor discussed the situation
and finally came to the decision that they
would consider no proposition that was j
not submitted jointly by the San Fran- !
cisro and the Pacific ga.s companies. The |
two companies have combined on rates,:
they declare, and therefore they must i
come together on some plan of compro
mise before the board will hear them.
At the meeting next Monday, while the j
corkscrew franchise will be a matter for I
consideration, it is certain it will not be!
finally acted upon. Supervisor Aigel- I
tinger, who announced at the time the!
not to call any meetings
of the board thai he would under no clr- j
.â on the franchises ;
even if the board met, Is responsible for
this statement.
"1 ?n cerely hope." he said, "that the
Mayor and the minority will meet with |
majority at the meeeting next Mnn- '
day. There are a number of important i
rs to be disposed of and many of
them require immediate action. If they;
do not meet the majority will do so any-,
w;iy. The board will sit in regular ses
i] hear all those who wi = h to
rd on the corkscrew franchises, but
positively there will be no final action,
taken at that- meeting. After the differ
ent organizations or persons have been J
heard the franchise will be referred back;
to the Street Committee.
NEW USE FOR
ICE BREAKERS
Russia Makes a Bold
Experiment.
TACOMA. Wash., June 9.â Vladivostok
advices received via Yokohama announce
that Russia has determined upon a defi
! nite policy of opening communication with
rh" interior of Siberia through Siberian
rivers flowing northward into the Arctic
Ocean.
This project was originated by Admiral \
Makaroff, who spent some time at Vladl
vostok and other Amur River ports two
years ago. He conceived the idea of util
izing big ice-breakins: machines, like those
! used in Denmark, for keeping an open
winter channel through the ice to Vladi
vostok. The ice breakers were subse
quently brought out and have proved an
entire success.
Admiral Makaroff then declared that ice
breaker? could bo similarly used to open i
a summer channel through the ice fields j
across Kara Sea, lying between Nova
Ztmbla and Obi Peninsula. This sea i
opens for a short time in July and August
but the open season is so short as to al-
HK si preclude the taking of supplies in i
steamships to the mouths of the various
Siberian rivers. Including the Obi, Lena '
. Yenisei and Khatangu. Admiral Maka
roff claimed that the ice breakers could
maintain an open < iiannel across Kara
Bee and around the northeast cape at
least four months in the year, enabling
, steamships to make several trips between
Northern Russian and Siberian ports "to
, Russia's great advantage from both mili
tary and commercial standpoints
Funds were supplied to carry out Maka
, roff s plan, with the result that he started
. for Kara Sea last month with the im
mense ice breaker Ermak. which per
formed prodigies during her trials last
winter. First she entered Cronstadt
pushing her way through a thick sheet
<>f ice. bhe was then sent to Reval where
twelve steamers were ice-bound and in
great danger. She freed these steamers
and an ice breaker belonging to tho town
Â° v f Rpvhl. towing five steamers through
the thick ice. This feat was so wonderful
thai the Ermak was taken up the ice
bound Neva River to St. Petersburg
whore the populace, with the Mayor at its
head, gave Admiral Makaroff' and his
: crew an enthusiastic reception

NO SUSPENSION
OF HOSTILITIES
President and Peace
Commission Agree.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 9.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
"While there is a divergence of views
on the part of members of the Philip
pine Peace Commission, as is usual in
a body of five men especially selected
because of their ability to form clear
opinions, this divergence is so slight
that it constitutes no bar to their work
ing together with sufficient harmony to
satisfy the President."
I am authorized t<> make this state
ment by a high officer of the adminis
: tration who has read the individual
views of the civilian members of th
, commission submitted to the President.
"The important point upon which the
' commission is agreed," he continued,
; "is that there should be no cessation of
hostilities, or, as the Herald expi
I it, that the military operations should
! continue during the rainy season, in
! order to keep alive the fear among the
! Filipinos, which the successful cam
: paign of the American troops has
| created."
It is denied that President Schurman
: has forwarded his resignation to the
! President or contemplates doing so, so
far as his dispatches indicate, but it
is admitted there is this difference of
! opinion between him and General Otis:
i President Schurman believes diplomacy
I should be coupled with force; General
; Otis thinks diplomacy should tie used
I when force has triumphed.
But in the Instructions given to Pres
; ident Schurman and his associates be
i fore they sailed for Manila, they were
' particularly cautioned against interfer
ing with military operations. Their
work, they were told, was to supple
l ment the military operations, and not
;to interfere with them. According to
. the official with whom I talked, they
! have carried out these instructions and
' will continue to do <=o, else there will
be a vacancy on the commission. The
views of the commissioners, showing
: their unanimous belief that military
; operations must continue, have im
i pressed the President, and in line with
'â  their recommendations he cabled Gen
; eral Otis to continue hostilities, and to
; President Schurman to neglect no op
j portunity to educate the natives as to
I the friendly purpose of this Govern
j ment.
The cablegrams received from Gen
j eral Otis and other members of the
I commission do not show that they are
j disturbed by Mr. Schurman's course,
â  and the reports of a disagreement in
the commission, it is reiterated, are
without foundation and doubtless cir
j culated in the interests of the anti-im
: perialists. The War Department re
! ceived a cablegram this morning from
; General Otis with reference to the mili
! tary situation, but Acting Secretary
Meiklejohn declined to make it public,
stating it related to unimportant de
tails. It is understood General Otis is
i preparing for another aggressive ex
pedition similar to that recently con
ducted against the insurgents at Anti
polo and Morong.

*â¢ ness often occurs as a primary affection,
in many instances it is but secondary to other
troubles. Thus any disorder of the digestive
systemâ the stomach, liver, bowels, etc., nearly
always is attended by nervous symptoms. In
no class of diseases, however, is nervousness
bo marked as in those diseases that relate to
the delicate organism of women.
DISEASES OF WOMEN are always attended
by symptoms that are entirely remote from
the seat of disorder. Paleness, weakness, ner-
vousness, are often experienced lone before the
true character of the disease is discovered.
Headaches (Fig. 1), Sunken Cheeks 'Fie. 2),
Palpitation of the Heart (Fig. 3), Impaired
Digestion (Fig. 4), Torpid Liver (Fig. E) and
Costiveness are all prominent symptoms that
attend those ailments peculiar to women, syrr.p-
toms that may mislead until disease is firmly
established.
HUDYAN readily corrects the above symp-
toms whether they occur as primary affec-
tions or whether they are secondary to female
disorder. HUDYAN is the best remedy ever

The power is being exercised to the

PHILADELPHIA
AT HONOLULU
Kautz Talks of Samoan
Rebellion.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
HONOLULU. June The United States
Bte.arr.ship Philadelphia arrived from Sa-
V moa yesterday. The admiral did not con
â â¢^ sider it necessary to keep the cruiser at
Apia, and she Is now on her way to Mare
Island.
"All parties have agreed to abide by
â¢what the commission decide," said Rear
Admiral Kautz this morning, speaking of
Samoan affairs. "Whether they will keep
their agreement or not mains to be seen.
Malletoa Tanu appeared before the com
mission several days before we left and
Mataafa the day before we left. Three
boats were sent to bring Malieti one
representing each of the three nations.
But he came in his own big war canoe,
accompanied by two others, each contain
ing about 200 men. The Fittings of the
commission are not public, though they
cannot be said to be secret. Still, very
little of what goes on before them be

will come out all right.
"The situation of Apia is one of quiet

Mataafa had been elected by his own

by the Germans; so there was no King in
power. Neither was there a president of
the Municipal Council. When Dr. Raffel

est tension yet reached in the Fountain

Attorney Fall stated that lives were
placed in Jeopardy by the admission of the

whip the man whi testified so on the

have t" i- Kik.-n if they were not shielded
by the crnirt. Th* 3 court paid they must

CHRISTIANITY AND
JUDAISM COMPARED
Remarkable Address of H. Wein
stock â Declares the Two Sys
tems Are Interlinked.
STOCKTON. June 9.â H. Weinstock,
the well-known merchant. dell\
markable address at the Jewish syna
gogue to-night. After reciting what Ju
dasism had done for Christianity, h<
what Christianity had done for modern
Judasism.
The speaker said the systems were
closely interlinked. If there had been no
Abraham th< re would have beei
. no Isaac, no Jacob; no Jacob, no
David; no David, no Christ or
of David. Had there been no Jewish fol
lowers of the Nazarine Christianity
might never have had an Impetus. Had
there been no Peter the mother church
could nol point to the flsh* rm
If there had been no Cromwell and Sut
- English cavali.-rs the Pilgrim
Fathers never would have, sought Plym
outh Rock or Lord Baltimore an asylum
in Maryland, and thus there would be no
free America where the modern Jew,
â  centuries of persecution, could b<
Aid with the diadem of full citizen
ship and privilege, exemplifying
â -.- of religion. The Pilgrim Fathers
had the Jewish laws and prophets with
them when they laid the foundations of
New England.
The speaker urged that on broader
lines there was no oci aslon for a conflict
of tho systems, ns both could work side
by side for the uplifting of humanit;
for the spread of thÂ»- principles of the
fatherhood of God and the brotherhood
of man.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 9.â Late this afternoon
occurred one of those slaughters of the inno
cents around the Sugar post, on the floor of
the Stuck Exchange. which have come to be
looked for as a periodical incident In the hit
tory of the exchange. For weeks there havi
been direful predictions that the end of ths
Sugar company as a dominant factor in the
refining industry was at hand, that the right
of its life was r.n its hand?, that its suspen
sion of dividends was imminent to carry on
the war and all sorts of disastrous predic
tions. Gentlemen supposed to be versed in the
Inside affairs of the company have either been
Filent with an expression of plaintive Badness
or have freely admitted their conviction of
the truth of the worst that could be said.
Many persons attracted by the prevailing high
â  level of Sugar, considering these conditions
have sold the stock very* liberally with the
expectation of buying back when the collapse
came. A great many of these bought their
stock to cover short contracts to-day at a
level nearly 20 points above that at which
the direful predictions had carried it. Inside
Interests became averse to selling and held
out tenaciously for higher rices. This excit
ing incident closed on a uniform strength
throughout the market.
The action was very similar to that of yes
terday, the early strength centering In the
New York Traction stocks and grangers. The
bears made an Ineffectual attempt to check
advance by raiding down Continental Tobacco
over 3 points. They turned Sugar backward
11 points, but without marked effect on the
general list. Later there was realizing in the
.N. v York Traction groups with reactions of
about a point. The vigorous strength developed
by coalers again turned the market upward.
Again the =ame thing happened In the last
hour, when professionals took profits In Sugar
and the Traction stocks. The recovery began
in some of the obscure stocks, Dcs M Inea,
Fort Dodge rising 4U. Consolidated Gas - points
and the Wisconsin Central, new issues, 2?!24.
People's Gas and Steel ami Wire also came
late into the advance, the latter on a pub
lished opinion by a director in favor of a
dividend on the common stock. Then came
the rush in Sugar which made the last prices
the highest of the day. The net gain Irf

of gold was without the slightest effect on
the market, as was the continued large sell
ing for London account. An Improved tone

the day's market. Anacondas rising 2\. Th

The Transvaal deadlock still dominates the

sols fractionally better. Americans were the \
strong features. They were active and re I
malned hard on the lead of Louisville and 1
Nashville. New York checked the rise mo- I
mentarily, but on the street they recovered
to the best. Spanish 4s were 64%.

BRADSTREETS FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June 9.â Bradstreet's financial j
review to-morrow will say:
At the beginning of the week the market
showed a disposition to continue Its dull, sag- i
ping tendency. The announcement of further j
shipments was calculated to support this be
lief, and with the absence of any public buy- !
Ing, led the professional traders to act on the
short "Ide of the account. There was, however,
less evidence of liquidation, and the money
market failed to show any trepidation on ac- ,
ccunt of the cold shipments, which for the
past ten days reached the total of $2,500,000.
The large gold holdings of both the bank and
the treasury, with the abundance of money i
and the absence of any exceptional demands at j
present, rob the specie movement of its usual â 
effect. It also clearly is recognized that at the !
present rates cf exchange some European in- '
threat, generally thought to be the Bank .if J
England itself, has put a premium upon gold !
shipments sufficient to luce an artificial flow
from this country.
Then* was a steadier tone In Tuesday's trad-
Ing, and Wednesday yielded two incidents,
which, for the time being at least, seem I to
change the temper of the speculation. One of
these was the declaration of the regular three
iwr cent c^uarterly dividend in the American
Sugar Company's common stock, a matter j
about which the street had indulged in moie
or less doubts for a full month. The other was
the declaration of a I s -- per cent semi-annual |
dividend on Atchlson preferred, with the an- â 
nouncement ihat the earnings of the road in 'â 
the fiscal year ending June 30 would also pro- |
vide for another half-yearly dividend of the j
same amount next January. Covering, not only I
in the stocks just named, but In other parts j
of the : st, at once ensued, and some fresh buy- (
ing was attracted. The upward movement con- I
tinued 1 n Thursday. Th steel stocks, in spite i
of me Irregularity in American Steel and J
Wire, were generally higher, and the strength
of the market on the whole seemed to center
in the portions of the list which had been the :
object of the principal bearish pressure. Lon- ;
don took but a small part in the trading here. I
The bind market continued very strong, with
unabated demand for the beter kinds of issues.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, June *.â Bradstreeet'a to
morrow, June 10, will say: Exceptional firm- 1
ness in prices at the highest level as regards
general staple values yet reached, a season
ably small rate of business mortality, undl
minlshed Industrial activity, perhaps most
manifest In all branches of trade In which '
iron, steel and other metals enter, and large
bank clearings, reflecting to some extent the
Improved tone of stocks, but likewise large
payments on previous profitable business, were
among the features, not necessarily new, but
stilt noteworthy, reflected in trade advices.
Enlarged shipments of breadstuffs, a result
of buying. Induced by crop damage reports
at home ami abroad, it is true, has not been
.sufficient to offset liquidation on the late mod- '
crate rise, but this is partially explained by
continued good advices trom the spring wheat
crop, confirmed by liberal receipts at primary
points. Iron and steel display all of their old ,
and some new strength In the urgent demand
for the balance of the year, and the usual
summer shut-down seems likely to be hon
red more In the breach than In the observ
ances In this trade. The outlook In the trade
as regards next season's labor scale is un
settled. Active demand for refined sugar has
apparently induced some relaxation in the !
war among refiners and raw sugars share in j
the advance this week. Wool is firm and i
even higher in some grades at leading mar
kets, With a fair business doing. Lumber re
tains all Its strength, reflecting continued ac
tivity In consumption lines. In transporta
tion "lines, too, business is exceptionally good

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, June 9.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The past week has brought a rise In prices not
equaled in any other week of many years. Iron
products have advanced 8.82 per cent In one
week and pigiron 4.8 per cent, following ad
! vances of S per cent in pig and 4 per cent In
products during May. Cotton has advanced 1
per cent and cotton goods 2.8 per cent; com
mon goods 1.8 per cent during the week, with
woolen goods 0 per cent and boots and shoes
! 1 per cent. A little reaction of 6 per cent ap
pears in leather and 7 per cent In hides, but
the characteristic of the time Is that expecta
tions of higher prices induce buying far in ad
vance of requirements for consumption. It Is
needless to say that this is a symptom of dan
ger, and the most conservative manufacturers,
especially In iron and steel, have striven to
avoid it, but actual inability to deliver prod
ucts demanded leaves them little power, while
speculation in wool and ether lines is running
away from consumption. It is a saving fea
ture that quotations are largely fictitious. Al
most all the goods now being delivered or pro
duced in some industries are on prices iixed
by order accented several months ago, and
nearly all the Iron works being thus tied up
far ahead the prices quoted indicate not at all
what they are getting, but whnt they see lit
to ask as a way of refusing orders which they
', cannot accept, or else the bids of impatient
buyers who can find nobody ready to deliver
large quantities. During the past week quota
tions have risen for anthracite No. 1 to $17 60,
for Uessemer to $18 50 at Plttsburg, for gray
forge to $16 25, for billets, with practically no
sales, to 181, for bars $27 per ton. for plates
i and sheets as much, for rails to $26, for Htruc
tural beams and angles $5 per ton and for wire
nails 25c per keg. But there are no accounts
of large transactions at these or any other
prices, though small sales of pig last week for
ItAly and this week for Bremen at market
prices, with German offers for 10,000 tons of
Southern pie. indicate the needs abroad are
quite as great as they are here.
While there Is a better demand for woolen
goods, so that prices of some have advanced, it
Is not yet possible to distinguish heavy specu
lative operations In wool at Boston, from ef
forts of mills to buy. The prices current in all
wool-growing sections are so high as to pre
! vent sales in Eastern market:.' to consumers,
and thÂ» readers who believe that mills' will

1897,", n0t realizing the Flze of the stock held.
! The cotton market has advance,! 1 l-16c without
other reason than the good demand, but stocks
Of cotton here and abroad are heavy and the
Financial Chronicle estimates a decrease of only
3.2 per cent in acreage. Goods are selling
i largely and prices of ginghams and prints have
advanced.
After rome advance wheat suddenly declined
2c. closing lower for the week. Against all ac
counts of Injury is the solid fact that Western
receipts were 5,049,194 bushels for the week,
against 1,477,04.1 from the great crop. of last
year, and at current low prices such receipts
would be Inexplicable if growers really expect a
short yield. Exports have declined, being only
1,845,373 bushels, flour Included, from Atlantic
ports, against 4,207,294 bushels last year, and
; 023,400 bushels from Pacific, ports, against 2".3,
--213 bushels; but even as to future foreign de
! mand this Is not strong evidence. The esti
mates of reduction in yield are weakened on '
the marVed Judgment by certainty that the
spring wheat acreage Is unknown and may ex
ceed expectations and that the prospect Is ex
cellent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 9. â WHEAT â For a
brief period immediately . following: the
opening wheat showed some degree of
steadiness. This was due to the Kan
sas crop report making 25,000,000 bushels
the maximum possibility of that State's yield,
and to the continued Russian damage reports.
Hut steadiness was not of long duration. Open-
Ing at 74%Â®76c, July after a. few transactions
at those figures slid off. There were slight re
actions at time?, caused by covering by shorts,
but th; tendency in the main was steadily
downward, and before the noon hour the price
had touched 74MtC. The Northwest was a free
seller on the decline. Besides the natural feeling
of bearlshness caused by the Government crop
report due to-morrow, the market was much
depressed by Snow's crop report, which said
that 560,000,000 bushels was a conservative es
timate of the probable yield of winter and
spring wheat this year. These figures were
far over the average production for several
years past and made the market susceptible to
any selling pressure. Liquidation was checked
in the afternoon by a number of complaints
from Indian Territory, Kansas and Nebraska
of too much rain and the market received sub
stantial support, the first In some time, when
private cables were received from a prominent
Chicago grain dealer now in Russia confirming
the worst reDorts as to thÂ» condition of the
crops of Southern Russia and Roumanla. Pre
vious to this time the market had declined to
73"ic, but during the last half hour's trading
a recovery to 74%@74%c took place. That was.
the price at the dose.
CORN â Corn was dull and a little lower
throughout. Commission houses were moderati
sellers and buying was scattered. Complaints
of too much rain in the corn belt had a steady
ing influence on prices. Cash demand was
rather poor. July closed ] /sC lower.
OATSâ Oats were dull and a shade lower.
Crrp reports were somewhat bullish, but sym
pathy with wheat was shown in the class of
selling. There was little cash demand. July
closed %c to >,ie lower.
PROVISIONSâ were practically at
a standstill during most of the session. There
was some commission house selling of pork
and the decline that followed was shared in a
degree by other products. Packers also sold
moderately. Buying was scattered. At the
close July pork was 10c lower, lard 5c lower and
ribs 2't.c to Be lower.

C ''I. Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been .six arrivals of coal from i
British Columbia with 20,131 tons; three from
Washington, 6775 tons; two from Oregon, 575
tons; one from Baltimore, 4800 tons; one from
Australia, 2050 tons; total, 34,631 tons. The de
| licveries of this week are largely above the
average, yet but little will go Into yard, the ;
! major portion going direct to consumers. If
the Government should require any large de
liveries within a prescribed time, which It
usually does, it would find it no easy matter
to do so. This is the method usually adopted
to furnish transports with fuel. Business
generally in this line is reported fair, sales
being up to the average and prices are steady.
It Is singular that at this time last year there
were fifteen more vessels loading coal in j
Australia for here than at present, with about J
41,000 tons more coal, although the outlook ,
this year is most encouraging for a large sur- !
plus of wheat and barley, whereas at this time
In IS'JS our crops had become an assured
failure. Shipments from Cardiff and Swansea
are Increasing; from the former port they are
principally tor the Navy Department. Hono
lulu is drawing a large quantity of coal from
the colonies, and is paying generous prices for
the same. Coal freights from England and i
Australia are neld at full figures which are
making importers slow to ship. Freights from
the northern coast have been marked up, as
tonnage is scarce."

Butter and Eggs are rather dearer this week.
Cheese is unchanged. i
Meats stand about the same as for some time,
and there does not seem to be much prospect
of their getting any cheaper at present. The
Poultry market is not heavily supplied and
prices continue rather hlgn In consequence.
The assortment of summer fruits continues to
increase as the season advances, and th? mar
! ket is now well furnished with Apples, Pears,
! Plums, Peaches, Apricots, Berries, etc. The
i summer Vegetables are in their usual abundant
i supply.

SECRETLY VIEWS
THE HARBOR
Big Contract Closed
Last Night.
GENERAL WILSON'S IDEAS
DOES NOT FAVOR THE SCHEME
OF A TIDAL CANAL.
Although Much Money Is Available
for Harbor Improvement, It
Will Not Be Used Till
Congi-ess Meets.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
SOS roadway, June 9.
Unknown to all hut a few of those in
nerepted in the development of Oaklanc
harbor, General Wilson, chief of th<
United States corps of engineers at Wash
ington, has just ma I a personal inspec
tlon of the harbor. He was accompanied
by a few prominent water front men. bu'
not wishing to be mixed up with deli
tlona anxious to revive the old contro
versy between Oakland and Aiameda, .'-is
visit was kept a found secret.
To-night thÂ« contract at present exist
ing for dredging the harbor was com
pleted. This marks an important step li
the development of harbor Improvements
It means that there is now at low tide
twenty feet of water from the hay up t<
"Webster street bridge in a channel 300 feel
wide. The dredger pumped the last buck
et of mud this evening; and nothing more
will be done until Congress awards a new
contract. There is at present S.'ttO.OOO or
hand to continue the work cast of Web
eter street bridge, and another $300 000 will
Ultimately be available, the whole having
to be spent at the rate of $133,000 per an
num.
Major Heuer, who is In charge of thÂ«
Government engineering works on this
coast; has asked the War Department to
appoint a commission of engineers to sur
vey tho whole of the harbor and report to
the Government as to the best methods to
be pursued in deriving the greatest bene
fit from the appropriations provided by
Congress.
General Wilson, judging from his re
marks, docs not seem to favor the build
ing of the tidal canal, which scheme is
considered by Aiameda tci be absolutely
necessary to that city's sanitary perfec
tion. The general, who is in a position
to practically dictate what shall be done,
said enough to indicate that he believes
the money could be spent to best ad
vantage in improving the harbor proper.
This eld fight between Oakland and Aia
meda is responsible for the hanging up
of more than $250,000, which might be
spent at once. Dr. J. T. McLean was the
leading spirit in AJameda's light, but he.
iÂ« no longer Health Officer of that city,
and the Oakland harbor promoters are not
sorry that the aged official is having a
well-earned rest.
It Is probable that an effort will be
made to have the width of the harbor in
creased tv 500 feet and to increase thÂ«
d-pth to twenty-live ...... the next
Congress convenes the War Department
and tho local engineers will probably hay*=
arrived at an understanding that will up
set many of the cherished plans of those
personally Interested !n the harbor and
who have been lighting over its develop
ment for many years.

MEDAL OUR HONORED
VOLUNTEERS WILL WEAR
i- 1 vfhv soldier or Bailor who volunteered In tho service of hi? country
â from California during the Spanish-American war will be decorated
(^ by the people of this State as a recognition of his patriotism. The
I * movement originated with the Native Sons of the Golden West, and
the medal design recently accepted by a committee is herewith re
produced.
On the obverse Bide of the emblem is preserved the main features and
general appearance of the seal of the State of California. As will be seen
in the accompanying Illustration the figure of California is portrayed in a
Bitting posture. â¢
On the shield is the head of Minerva and at her side is a grizzly bear,
typical of California. At the foot of the dias are scattered the fruits and
flowers of the Golden State, with the soldier and sailor at either side./ To
the left are seen the soldiers' tents at the Presidio, while on the bay, to the
right, is the United States battleship Olympia.
On the reverse side of the proposed medal the Stars and Stripes are
shown, linked to the bear flag of this State. The name of the donors is
raised on the upper rim. leaving ample space underneath for that of the re
cipient. In the center is the shield of the United States, encircled by a
wreath of laurel, and at the base is a tablet on which are words explanatory
of the gift â >â¢â¢.'â  â :â '-;â  li:'
A design submitted by K. K. Hopps was considered second best. The
bar submitted in his design will be used. It beers California in raised let
ters, with a grizzly's head peering over the upper .edge.
PHOTOGRAPHING A
WILE OF ARLINGTON'S
Oakland Office San Franciscr. Call, !*>s Broadway. .Tune 9.
WHKN Arthur Arlington, the notorious bunko man, has an opportunity
in court next Wednesday be will present the most unique defense on
record to ;!.Â« charge of Felony preferred against him by Mrs. Minnie
Smith. The evidence will consisi of a photograph showing that after
ihi- alleged snatching of the lady's purse by Arlington the would-be divorces
consented t<> pose in a very loving attitude before the camera. When this lit
tle Incident was taking- place at Piedmont Springs Mrs. Smith did not know
that the hoary-headed adventurer was killing two birds with one stone. He
was making evidence to help him in the. p\-tÂ»m of his arrest fnr robbery and
a very forcible argument why Mrs. Smith, who is n<>t yet
divorced, Bhould desire to kc-p the Incident very quiet.
Th( I nying that the adventurer and the lady he was about to em
ploj as h. per did Btrike a very affectionate pose. The earner;'.
portrayed it with -trikiiig fidelity. It was a tintype apparatus and only pro
tive that might produce tell-tal^
! libitum. Arlington took me of the gems, Mrs. Smith t h^ other,
each is prizing the possession with great Becrecy, fully Intending that
suggestive photograpl iced until the proper moment.
"Would a woman who has just been violently robbed of 121485 consent to
â  picture su.-h as this?" says Arlington.
That is the story from Arllngi ii of view.
"It was perhaps foolish." said Mrs, Smith to-day, "that 1 should have
the old wretch to have ny photographed. II" is a very suave,
â¢ manly old man. old enough to be my grandfather, and really I had no
: â  C the thing when I permitted It. 1 was earn
estly looking for work, having t<> support myself and little girl. I am living
Aiih my Bister, Mrs Slebert, and had saved every cent I had and which I
earned by hard work. He positively robbed me "f my money and refused
to return It, and even if 1 did act a little foolishly, that does not excuse
him."
Mr?. Biebert, sister "f Mrs. Minnie Smith, is prepared to overthrow Arl
ington's story of it:- â  iph and the deduction that he draws from it.
'My sister is young," bI â¢â¢ said, "and has been brought up In the coun
try- She is not acquainted with the ways of these old rascals. Arlington
has duped women much smarter than my sister, and chief Lees tells me
that since I**] he has been d"iug these tricks and makes a specialty of in
ducing the woman to Ik- photographed, so that he can hÂ«ve something with
which to browbeat her. Ws are fully prepared to offset his story about the
photograph. He has also lied In saying that after leaving the spring* he
went with my sister to San Francisco. They never went out of Oakland. I
was very much surprised to find In some of th- newspapers, but not in The
Cull, that 1 had taken up a chair and attempt.-.! to brain the old beast In
court. I v. â  : the courtroom al all that day, and the incident was
entirely false. ! think my sister deserves credit for standing up and prose
cuting this man when so many women have been duped and are too afraid
of publicity u> come forward and see that he gets his merited punishment.
re he is through he will be very sorry that he gave away the story of
the photograph."

ELLENBERG HAS
DESERTED HIS
YOUNG BRIDE
Sad Sequel of an April
Elopement.
HE IS WANTED FOR PERJURY
IRATE FATHER-IN-LAW AP
PLIES FOR A WARRANT.
Marrieu Life Had No Charms for the
Groom, Who, It Is Alleged,
Swore Falsely to His
Age.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 9.
The sad sequel of another elopement de
veloped to-day, when William Sill, an
irate father, and his daughter, a deserted
j wife of little over a month, called at the
l District Attorney's office in quest "f a
j warrant for the arrest of Robert Kllen
berg, the deserting spouse, on a charge of
perjury.
Ellenberg and Miss Mabel Sill -were se
j cretly married In San Francisco last .April.
Several weeks elapsed before the faci <if
the elopement was made known to .Miss
: Sill's part-ins, who reside In Easi Oak
i land, and to say that they were dum
i founded Is p'.ittinK it mildly. However, no
| very serious objections were raised and
the young bride and groom temporarily
I made their home with the kt m's brother
in San Franc-is.-... The latter had prom
ised to start the young benedict in the
; bakery business in The metropolis, but the
two brothers soon disagreed, disputes
; arose and wordy wars were waged. Fin
ally the young couple were ordered to
: seek a new domicile. Mrs. Bllenberg the
next day missed her husband and he has
n.it been s.-.-n or heard from Bince.
Had Ellenberg not deserted his young
bride he mighi have gained assistance,
! but now the young woman's parents'
' wr&tfa knows no bounds.
An Inspection of the marriage license
revealed a good cause for EUenberg's ar
rest, in the document he hud taken <'nth
that his age was 21 years, when il is
stated tn be a fad that he has n.>t seen
nineteen summers, and his young wife has
i Been less. Because he is alleged to have
] sworn falsely In order to secure the li
cense, a warrant was asked, but inas
much as the case is one obviously within
: the jurisdiction of th>- San Francisco au
thorities Mr. Sill was advised t.. go to
, the metropolis for the greatly desire. l
warrant.

TRIES THREE TIMES
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
Mrs. Alma Undo Would Die Because Her ;.
Husband Abandoned Her. S
MRS. ALMA UNDO, the wife of Lawrence Linda, steward in the Popular
Restaurant en Geary street, is determined to end her life owing to her
husband having oast her off for the society of another woman. Mrs.
Undo has made three unsuccessful attempts within twenty-four hours,
and she declares that the next effort will not be a fHlure.
On Thursday night she attempted to swallow a do.se of Rough on R:U^. but
was prevented from carrying out her intention by Mrs. Kelly, the landlady of
the house at 711 Stockton street. She was taken to the Receiving Hospital
in a hysterical condition and was released shortly before 10 o'clock. Mrs.
Undo thin went to her husband's room at 668 Mission street with her two
year-old boy and begged him to give up his infatuation for Mrs. Tilmes and
live with her again, but he told her that he would not live with her and that
he Intended leaving the city soon, so that he would ma see <>r hear of her
again. Mrs. Undo then stole a revolver from him and went away determined
to di.-.
Yesterday morning after brooding over her troubles she took the revolver
and, placing the muzzle against her temple, pulled the trigger. Her aim was
bad and the bullet lodged in the ceiling. Twice more s!;.- pulled the trigger
with the same result, and before she could lire again Mrs. Kelly rushed into
the room atid took the weapon from her. A few hours "iter she purchased a
quantity of morphine? and swallowed it. The Receiving Hospital was notified
and she was taken there in the ambulance, where the usual remedies were
administered with satisfactory results. She declared, however, that the next
attempt would be successful, as she would not live without her husband. She
will soon again become a mother.
Officer McMurray of the Society tor the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
was notified ami he interviewed Mrs. Lindo in the hospital. She told him
that she and her husband had been married for three years and lived happily
together till about three, months ago, when he left her owing to his infatua
tion for Mrs. Tilmes. who is at present living with her mother in Boulder
Creek till she can get a divorce from her aged husband and Lindo can obtain
a divorce from his wife so that they can remarry.
McMurray tailed upon Lindo and was surprised to find that he had been
paying his wife *2'i per month for the support of herself and child. Undo
said they wen- only married May 5 last by Justice of the Peace Barry; that
be bad been arrested for betrayal uncVi promise of marriage and Questioned
in Judge Graham "3 court He was then warned that unless ho marri<-d the
woman hi- would be sent to San Quentin. Lindo said he had no intention of
living with her. but would support her and the child. He is only I'l years of
age and does not deny his preference for Mrs. Tilmes. who is a year younger.
ATHLETES ARE SUSPENDED.
The athletes of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association are Btirred up over the
recent action of the athletic council, re
sulting in the suspension of D. G. (irant
and w. Lamont, two of the most promi
nent athletes of the Mission branch of the
association. The two men in question took
part in the Indoor championship meeting
recently held In the Olympic club gymna
sium. They entered under the standards
of the Olympic Club, ignoring their own
affiliations. The association athletic com
mittee met, and, following the spirit and
letter of the rules which govern their ath
letic affairs, the two athletes wore sus
pended for a year. Lamont won the 1000
--yard race and Grani the high jump, mak
ing ten i "fins for the Olympic Club. Had
they entered with the Mission team, the
score would have been Olympics 15, Mis
sions 14. which would have placed the lat
i, â : a close second.
On July 8 the three branches of the
association will hold a general champion
ship field day for the establishment of
new records. The main branch, the Mis
sions and the Oakland's will compete. The
programme will include the regular thir
teen events on track and field, with pos
sibly a mile relay added. Medals for rec
ord breaking and first places will be given
bj the association. The Held day will be
held on Berkeley oval.

continued to-day by Sheriff Taylor,
Detective Ed Gibson and a score of
â¢uoodchoppers, who are anxious to earn
the ?50 reward offered by District At
torney Mclsaacs. Meanwhile Dier, who
has been under arrest since Monday
last, is gradually approaching a stage
of nervous collapse, and if he had a
hand in the alleged murder of French

he will confess before many more days
shall have passed.
Sheriff Taylor and Detective Gibson
left here for Carson Canyon early this
morning and remained there until late
this afternoon. They examined the
missing man's cabin thoroughly in the
hope of unearthing more evidence

another lengthy Interview with Dier.
Detective Gibson left for San Fran
cisco this evening to hold a consulta

Sheriff Taylor is quite elated over the
strong chain of circumstantial evidence
which has been forged about the pris

the event of Lorraine's body being
found he believes that he has evidence
enough to send I Â»ler to the gallows.
The Sheriff has made arrangements to
Fend at least sixty men into Carson
Canyon Sunday to search for the miss-
Ing o idehopper's body.
"1 am absolutely certain that Lor
raine has been murdered." said Sheriff
Taylor to-night. "Everything indicates
niurder and all we want to do now is
to find his body. T am satisfied that it
Is not far from his cabin, for his mur
derer would find it a difficult job to
carry the body far in that rough coun

The following preamble and resolution
was adopted:
Whereas, Extensive press notices of the pro
ceedings of our conference have been given In
the columns of several of the newspapers â¢>:
Stockton and elsewhere, therefore be it
lived, That we express our appreciation
by a. vote of thanks to the editors and publish
; ers of those papers, and especially to the Stock
! ton Mail, Stockton Independent ami The Ban
j Francisco Call.
The interior of the Stnte Is just beginning to be heard
from, but from now on money will come from all sections
without cessation until the â¢â¢mire $100,000 called for is sub
scribed. President Flu-lan and Secretary Fletcher have within
the past two days seni out communications to the Mayors of.
the most Important cities In the State sotting forth the objects
of the movement and asking them to assist It In every way in
their power. It Is expected they will call meetings In their
respective cities, appoint committees to collect funds and co
<'l>'r;ite with the general committee of this city. In this way
the work will be greatly expedited.
The souvenir certificates will not be ready for distribution
for a week or two yet. They are so elaborate in design that
it is slow work for the artists to execute the three vignettes
and the fancy border, but w"hen completed they will be worthy
of the cost and labor expended on them.
The site is still under consideration by the sub-committee
having charge of that portion of the work, and the members
are nearly distracted by the great mass of communications
they receive each day offering suggestions on the subject.
The committee on design is also having its Bhare of trouble
of this nature, but is proceeding steadily collecting drawings
of all the notable monuments In the world, estimate* of the
cost of various materials, etc., and, In fact, completing all the
preliminaries, so that at the proper time the members can go
ahead without the loss of a day.
Next Friday's meeting will be the most eventful since the
committee was organized, for besides the big Jump the sub
scription list will take then there will be other important mat
ters under consideration.

passengers to the quarantine station. Con
s' gui titly It was late in the afternoon be
fore she reached her berth at the Mail
dock.
The Doric brought the news that the
rare between the barkentlne Wrestler and
brig Lurline to Kahulul had been won by
the latter by two days. There is only
wharf accommodation at Kahulul for four
or tiv.- ships, and In consequence the first
: there gets the vacant berth. In
11 nsequence, when the Lurline and Wrest
ler were both scheduled to sail on May 17
there was a great deal of Interest at
tached to the run to the islands. The
captain of the barkentlne was not taking
ai i tiances, however, so he hurried mat

earlj on May 16. He did not reach Ka
hului until .May 30.
When Captain McLeod of the Lurline
heard that his rival had secured a day's
start, of him he vowed thai he would beat
him down if he had to carry away can
vas in doing so. Ihe Lurline left h< â 
May 17 and reached Kahulul on May 29,
thus making the run in twelve days, while
the Wrestler took fourteen days. The

cards^and spades and then beat them into

SACRED HEART FEAST
Fatner Carrol Lectures on the Theme
at at. Francis Church.
The Feast of the .Sacred Heart was
observed at St. Francis Church yesterday.
In the morning a large number of the
League of the Sacred Heart received com
munion. In the evening Father Carrol
delivered a sermon on the. "Pleadings of
the Sacred Heart." lie said in part:
"it is wrong to imagine that devotion
to the Sacred Heart in every form and
kind is of recent origin. it has been the
center of attraction of the saints of every
age and country It was this that caused
St. John to recline upon the bosom of his
Master at the last supper. It was only
in the seventeenth century that the de
votion became explicit and public. Its
propagator was a nun of the Visitation
order, Margaret Mary Arlacoque. and teh
convent at Which she resided is at Paray
le-Monlal. France. In September 1894, . I
visited this place and celebrated mass
there."
Mayor of Salinas.
On March 14 of last year there wag an
election In Salinas city at which a candi-
date named Frances was a candidate for
Mayor, as was also W. J. Hill. The proc
lamation for election directed that the
polls be kept open from sunrise to sunset.
In Salinas there are three wards. In two
the State law was followed and the polls
were closed at 5 p. m. Counting the votes
from all the wards Hill would have a
majority of 24, and he was declared elect
ed tjy the City Council. By rejecting the
votes cast in Wards 1 # and 2 as Illegal,
Francee would have been elected by 22,
and this was the conclusion reached by
the trial court. iu>Â°n which Hill appealed.
The Supreme Court affirmed the judg
ment of the lower court.
FUN FOR MERCHANTS.
Wholesalers to Own El Campo To-Day
and Use It With Their Friends.

a candy distribution for the babies and
the distribution of over 200 k;< t <=â  prizes
promlHe fun for everybody. The com
mittees have been working like beavers
and have accomplished wonders. The
prizes are varied and valuable, and will
make every number on the list of games
notable. Â«
The rlrst boat leaves the Tiburon ferry
a< 9:30 o'clock. Since some of the stores
cannot close until noontime., a second
boat has been arranged to run in the af
ternoon. As the round-trip tickets only

a correspondingly large sum for the Chil
dren's Hospital.
HANDSOME CHAPEL FOR
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
FACADE TO BE IN LINE WITH
THE QUADRANGLE.
Plans Already Prepared and Work
Will Beg-In at Onceâ A Beauti
ful Ornament to the
Grounds.
Plans for a magnificent chapel that will
grace the grounds of the Stanford Unl
| verslty have been prepared by Clinton
Pay. arid in the near future work on the
foundation will be begun. The chape] will
intersect the outer walls of the eastern
side of the quadrangle, th^ steps and
first elevation occupying the space now
used by the grand central archway which
' divides the Quadrangle in two equal parts.
The style of the chapel, which Is to be
a structure, of broad measurements. Is a
! mixture of Renaissance and a modifica
tion of the Romanesque. The ground floor
will liuve a large open and circular nave
i in the center, with an apse on either side
: running beneath a semicircular gallery.
On either Bide of the apse; both In the
front and rear, will be ante-rooms.
A tower will spring from the right cen
â  trul portion of the building to the right
of the lofty dome. The material to be
used will he red sandstone, Identical in
nature with that of the quadrangle. The
estimated cost of the new chapel is $50.(HX).
In beauty of conception It will equal any
of th( historic chapels of America. Its
'location in the midsi of the recitation
rooms and oi easy access from all pans
of the grounds makes H a great conveni
to thi- students.

IF TO SHOOT
Serious Charge of a
Police Officer.
ACCUSES SERGEANT BLANK
SAYS HE WAS DRUNK AT THE
Both Men Summoned to Appear Be
fore the Police Commissioners
at Their Next
Meeting.
Sergeant Blank of the Seventeenth-
Btreet station will In all probability be
called before the Police Commissioners at
tlielr next meeting to show cause
why he should not be dis
miss, Â1 f TOm the force. Blank is
a personal friend of Dan Burns, and
through his efforts he was made tfergeant
ol police. He has frequently boasted that,
notwithstanding his shortcomings, Burns
would "fix" the Commissioners in case he
was brought before them. Now that a
flagrant case of exceeding his duty h;is
been called to the attention of the Police
Board, Blank is anxiously waiting for his
friend Burns to "square" him.
Several days ago Policeman Stanley, one
of the best known men In the department
had occasion to call the attention of Cap
tain Gillen to Blank's conduct Stanley
was patrolling the beat on Church street,
wh.-n he was approached by Blank, who
insultingly demanded to know why he had
not arrested an Italian storekeeper for
setting fire to some rubbish in front of
his place of business. Stanley replied that
he had not seen the flre, but premised to
make an Investigation.
"You're too fresh, anyway," hotly re
torted Blank. "I have blown my whistle
three times, but failed to lind you on your
beat."
Stanley replied that he heard the whistle
only once and wh< n he started to find
l?lank the latter had quickly disappeared.
"You mean to call me a liar?" Inquired
Blank, quivering with excitement and
placing his hand on his pistol.
"1 guess you an. looking for trouble,"
meekly replied Stanley, who is one of the
crack shots of the Seventeenth-street
station, "if I were to turn my gun loose
then- would lit a new s< rgeant In the
Mission."
Evidently determined to avoid trouble.
Stanley went to the nearest patrol box
and informed Captain <;illen of the hostile
demonstration <>f .Blank.
"Gel him away from me," declared the
officer, in a tone denoting .uiK'-r. "or one
of us will go to the Morgu< ."
Evidently apprehending serious trouble
between the t\\" men, Captain Glllen or
dered Stanley to lose no time in reporting
to the Seventeenth-street station. In a
few minutes Blank appeared and offered
his hand to Stanley. 'Die latter refused
to accept it and demanded of <'aj>tain
Glllen to prefer charges against Klank.
Hi declared that the sergeani was under
the Influence of liquor and offered to prove
by several responsible witnesses that In
stead '>Â»' attending to police business he
was drinking In a saloon contiguous to
where the trouble occurred. Captain

STORY WAS TOO FISHY.
Ex-Treasuver of Sonoma County Re
buffed in the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court has sustained the
judgment of the lower court In the
of the County ol Sonoma against Peter
X. Stofen, ex-Treasurer of the county,
and his bondsmen to recover $7815 79, al
leged t<> have i d converted by him to
his own us.-. Stofen endeavored to prove
1 that he nad been robbed. His account â  f
the a flair was that after he had op ned
tin- doors â â !' th. vault and hid his hauls
filled with trays containing money he was
confronted by a man armed with a dag
ger, wiici ordered him to drop tin- trays.
Stofen said the stranger struck him .i
blow up- in the head, robbed him of n^
money and lucked him in the vault. Later
in the day the imprisoned Treasurer was
discovered by his wife.
The trial Judge rejected th:- evidence of
the robberj because of the fact that the
surroundings and general circumstances
were too suspicious, and that robbery was
simulated to hide a defalcation. The
higher court found no reason for dis-
I turbine th<> findings of the lower court.
Labor Council Edicts.
The Labor Council at its meeting last
nipht declared a boycott on the Techau
Tavern and on the San Pedro X I. dairy.

purpose of denouncing the Governor of
Idaho for his actions In the late trouble
in that State.
The delegate from the Musicians' Union
requested the council to notify the Fourth
of July committee to employ none but
union musicians at the general parade, as
also during the evening.
A legal opinion was furnished the coun
cil by .lames G, Maguire of the firm of
Maguire & Gallagher to the effect that
the eight-hour law applies to all labor
performed on the United States troop
ships in their fitting out in port. With
this opinion, it was stated. Colonel Long
agreed, and that he would in the future
see that it was carried out.
Further time was granted the executive
committee to make arrangements with the
Park Commissioners ana the contractors
having the dredgers at work at the Oak

THE GOOD OLD
PALMY DAYS
Miller and His Great
Company Here.
REPERTOIRE OF NEW PLAYS
TEN WEEK SEASON OF BRIL
LIANT SUCCESSES.
Rare Opportunity to Sample What
Has Only Been Offered in Lon
don and New
York.
Henry Miller and his band of famous
players got in yesterday morning, mak
ing the. run from New Fork straight
through, with only one stopover at Salt
l.ak>\ where a performance of "The
Lla is" was given.
The city of the Mormons, "the dog" on
which the company tried its tirst com
bined strength, proved a most enthusi
astic canine, and the play and the people
were given one great, barking welcome.
The advent of Mr. Miller and his play
ers for a ten weeks' season at the Co
lumbia, beginning on Monday evening, is
a managerial experiment, that the thea-r
ter goers of this city will most certainly
profit by.
Mr. Charles Krohman presents in this
way the very latest successes, plays that
have never been seen outside of New
York with a company, the like of which
in the ensemble New York lias never seen,
and all at. a reasonable cost to the man
agement. Heretofore each play was
brought out with the original company
and the run of ::'Â» ! " miles was only broken
by a stay in Chicago, with no dates what
soever between the Windy City and here.
The expense thus incurred was enormous
and even a tremendous business proved
Inadequate to balance accounts.
The present Bcheme "t Krohman's is
only feasible during the summer, when
the theatrical season is at a discount In
the East, thus permitting the banding to
gether of notable people willing to lend
their strength and talent to a perfect en-
Bemble.
Miller came in fresh and vigorous from
his Journey, with the determination to do
and win if good work, attention and tal
ent rightly directed can score. The plan
of the season is Millers. Prohman is the
backbone that makes the actor's Ideas
possible.
"We have an excellent company," Baid
Mr. Miller, "and we hope to deserve suc
cess. We will preseni the latest dramatic
successes, plays that have never in en
done outside of London and New York.
Further than that, we will produce
"Brother Officers," the latest London suc
cess, that won't be done in New York
until next season. We open in "The
Liars" with a wonderful cast, and no part
has been considered too Insignificant for
any of the big people in our company.
The repertoire tor our season Includes be
sides our opening play: "Lord and Lady
Algy," "The Adventures of Lady Ursula,"
a revival oi my first year's success;
"Heartsease," "One Summer's Day,
Phroso*, "Julius Caesar" and "Hamlet.
Mr. Miller, who by the way started his
career in the legitimate field with Ade
laide Neilson, has for years secretly been
cherishing the desire of appearing as the
melancholy I Â»ane.
"When 1 was Ij, " said the actor. "I
knew every line of 'Hamlet' and have
be< si turning it over in my mind ever
Blnce. To me 'Hamlet' represents the
greatest form of the poetic drama."
In Mr. Millet's company are E. J. Mor
gan, the Lyceum favorite; Margaret Ang
lin. the original Roxanne in Mansfield s
production >>f "Cyrano de Bergerac"; Guy
Standing and Blanchi Burton, favorites
of the Empire Company; Earl Brown and
Margaret Dale, who were out here lasi
P .'.-on with Mr. MilbT. and the valued
Lyceum actors. Mrs. Thomas Whlffen and
Charles Walcot.
Miss Anglin, the leading lady of the or
ganization, is a stranger <m this coast.
She has scored tremendous successes In
the East, notably with Sothern in "Lady
t'rsuln." Nevertheless she is aa nervous
a< a school yiii over her Rrsi appearance
in this city.
"In New York tiny t â¢ â¢1 â¢ i me you San
Franciscans are so hard to please that I
ana frightened hair to death," said the
lady. "The only thing thai keeps me
alive is what your Blanche Bates told
me before leaving: 'Do your best, she
said: 'at home we appreciate and when
we admire oh!" "

H. S. FOOTE OUT FOR
COURT COMMISSIONER.
If Appointed He Will Have All
the Chinese Cases.
Plan of the Coolie Brokers to Flood the
Country With Alleged Native-Born
Mongolian Citizens.
S[NCE the dismissal of Chief Meredith
of the Chinese Bureau the Chinese
brokers have not been able any long
er to secure copies of the transcripts
of the statements of Chinese Immigrants
.in the steamers made to members of the
Chinese Bureau, and they have been put
ting their heads together to devise some
other means of, landing their coolie chat
tels. It was necessary to obtain these
transcripts in order that the testimony
of the witnesses secured in Chinatown by
the brokers' bureau should correspond and
be consistent with that of the immigrant
as taken down by the shorthand reporter
of the bun an. otherwise the discrepancy
would be fatal to their case.
There Is now on foot a scheme whereby
immigrants may be landed easily by the
usual perjured evidence, and that is to
provide that there shall be only one ex
j amlnation, and that before the United
States Court Commissioner. In order to
accomplish this end a movement has bien
started to test the right of the, Chinese
Bureau to examine or pass upon the
claims for admission of Chinese alleging'
themselves to be native-born. An argu
ment has been made to the Secretary of
the Treasury, and It is a plausible one,
that the exclusion act relates only to ;.a-
I tives of China, and that it cannot legally
! govern the going or the coming of na
tives of tue United States. Hence, it is
argued, although the immigrant be clad
in Chinese costume and speak no lan
guage but Chinese: if he makes claim that
he is an American citizen by virtue of
his birth the exclusion act cannot be ap
plied to him. It will be the" duty of the
Collector of the Port to pass him insidj
tlie gates or to exclude him on the ground
that his assertion of nativity is not be
lieved. In the former case the immigrant
will be arrested by members of the Chi
nese Bureau for being illegally within the
United States and he will have the right,
claiming citizenship, of an appeal to the
local United States courts on writ of
habeas corpus. Then he will go before a
United States Commissioner with his wit
nesses and prove his nativity if he can.
Should he be excluded in the first place
by the Collector he can invoke the writ of
habeas corpus as an American citizen, as
he does now, and appear before the Com
missioner. In either case the bureau will
not have any record of statement made
by him to be contradicted by his wit
nesses.
This law point was brought up in the
Dick Williams case two years ago by
Lyman I. Mrvwry, the acknowledged au
thority on Chinese exclusion law. Mr.
Mowry argued on that occasion that the
Immigrant, if an American citizen, could
not cnme under the exclusion act. no mat
ter what might be his garb or speech.
The fact that he claimed to he a native
of this country was all that was required.
The truth or falsity of the statement of
the immigrant could be determined only
upon habeas corpus proceedings. The
court did not pass upon the point because
it was not considered relevant to the issue
then pending before the court. There
seems to be much merit in the contention
of Mr. Mowry from a technically legal
point of view, and it is this proposition
taat is now being laid before the Secre
, tary of the Treasury in Washington by
' Interested persons.
Another snag in the way of the coolie
importers has been and is United States
Court Commissioner Heacock. Judge
s Heacock himself cross-examines the China
man who claims to be a Yankee, and in
I nine cases out of ten he has been able by
\ a very few questions to determine whether
i the witnesses have lied or whether they
. have told the truth. Hence it is the pur
\ pose of the ring to avoid Judge Heacock
claiming to be native Americans, the
great obstacle of two conflicting state
ments as f?o the same acts having been
removed.
Ex-United States District Attorney
Henry S. Foote has filed an application
with United States District Attorney
Coombs for the position of United States
Court Commissioner. '-This is an appoint
ment solely in the hands of United States
District Judge de Haven. He may ap
point as many as he pleases, there being
no salary attached to the office, the emol
ument of the incumbent being 1 obtained in
fees. It is the intention of the coolie ring,
should Mr. Foote or any other person re
ceive the appointment, to bring all their
habeas corpus cases before the new Com
missioner, no matter who he may be.
This is not assuming that Judge Footra,
If he were appointed, would be more
lenient toward the immigrants than Judg*
Heacock. It would be simply a measure
<>f revenge against Judge Heacock for
preventing the illegal landing of Chinese.
There is no necessity for an additional
Commissioner. Judge Heacock has thirty
cases on his calendar awaiting trial, and
they will be disposed of whenever the at
torneys are ready to come into court.
The delay is in the Chinese bureau, which
has now eleven members and which is
away behind in its work. A prominent
Chinese lawyer remarked recently that two
inspectors and an interpreter some yeara
ago did more work than the entire eleven
are now doing.
A Strayed Dove Captured.
A stray carrier pigeon, that may be of
much value to some one, waa capture. l
by \V. H. Cain of College City, Cal., a
few days ago and will be held until an
owner claims it. In a communication re
ceived from Mr. Cain he states th;
bird came to his place about May 3" and
remained there several days. An exam
ination showed that it wore a small sil
ver band on one of its legs with the let
ters F. A. L. engraved thereon, and ho
caged it. thinking it might be valuable.
A number is also inscribed, but it has
been worn off. A communication sent to
College City will result in the bird's
speedy return to its owner.
