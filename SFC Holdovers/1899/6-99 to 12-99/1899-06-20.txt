VIRGIN GOLD IN CHUNKS IN
YUKON BASIN.
WONDERFUL FIND ON DAHL RIVER
VB. C, June 19.â The steamer Tees, the second of the treasure steamers from the
north, brings news of a wonderfully rich strike on the hills at the back of the Dahl River, in
the Koyokuk district. If the reports brought to Dawson by passengers up the river from
Circle City and Forty Mile be true chunks of virgin gold, some two and some more inches square,
have been found. A mad rush is on to the scene of the findsâ the maddest, it is said, in the his
tory of the Yukon.
The find was made, according to the reports which reached Dawson on the river steamer
Victorian, about six weeks ago. Miners who reached the Klondike capital by that steamer say
that the big rind was made by the purest chance. Two prospectors. A. Creighton and an old
German, were pitching camp while roaming through the hills, and when digging a hole for the
tent pole they turned up a flat piece of gold about one and one-half by two inches. A further
search revealed more chunks of virgin gold, and before darkness had' fallen the two fortunate
miners had a big sack.
They told no one of their find and hurried to Circle City to record it. After recording
their properties the old German let some friends then at Circle City in on it. They told others
and soon a small stampede began.
More finds of virgin gold were made. The news was then spread broadcast and the trail
â  as soon black with miners struggling on as fast as they could go to the gold-laden hills. Late
arrivals from Dawson say it is the maddest stampede that has as yet occurred in the northland.

MANILA. June 20, 8 a. m.â The
first absolutely authenticated in
stances of the mutilation of Am
erican soldiers by Filipinos oc
curred yesterday. Two privates
of the Fourth Infantry, who
were wounded during the recon
noissance toward Perez das
Marinas, were left temporarily
on the roadside owing to a lack
of transportation facilities. Later
when men went to bring them in
it was found they were dead.
Their right ears had been cut
off by the natives. The throat
7)f one was cut and the face of
the other slashed with a knife.
MANILA, June 20. â Sur

the enemy, six miles from
reinforcements and with a thou
sand more insurgents moving
rapidly down on their left to.
make their annihilation com
plete, the First Battalion of the
fourth Infantry. .Major Bubb
commanding, in all 300 Ameri
cans, fought their way hack from
Perez das Marinas, three miles
toward their military base at
Imus, where the rest of the
Fourth came to their support.
Reports were received that
F'erez das Marinas had l>een da
serted by the insurgents. The
Alcalde of the place came to
Imus and formally surrendered
his tow.n.
The houses along the roadside
were filled with amigos, and the
battalion advanced confidently j
until within three-fourths of a
mile of Perez das Marinas, when
they discovered the enemy. Par
alleling the road at long distance
on both sides and practically sur-j
rounding the little force, the na
tives began firing from houses in
the rear, and natives in white
clothes were captured with guns
in hand.
The whole scheme was to wipe
out the small body of American
troops, and it might have suc
ceeded but for the marvelous
courage of the troops and offi
cers.
The fight began at noon and silenced
the enemy's fire in ono hour.
The Americana on retiring discov
ered th;it they were surrounded. The
skirmish linos crowded tho Filipinos
and drove the insurgents back toward
Imus, while the outflankors were on tho
right and lr-ft.
T'ndor the flanking fire ihe rear guard
whs desperately holding tho enemy's
rushes in check. An incessant and
galling fire was poured upon the main
road, and the men were falling every
where. The ambulance was filled, and
carts were pressed into service, loaded
with the wounded, and dragged by
hand by prisoners. Two of our dead
were left behind.
At 3 o'clock it looked as if nothing
could save the battalion. At 4 o'clock
they had pressed the enemy off. and
on the right they were at last behind
them.
Fifteen minutes later Hazzard, the
aid of General Wheaton. pushed
through alone wtth the news that
Wheaton was coming to the relief.
The men with a choer wildly went for
the Filipinos. Then General Wheaton
found a force of the enemy a thousand
strong moving to intercept the bat
talion along the road where it runs at
right angles. Ho opened with a shrap
nel fire and mowed down the insur
gents. He then cleared out the left
and advanced rapidly.
At 4:30 he had the enemy in full front
and gained a mile and a half of lost
ground.
The regiment bivouacked at last in
the rice fields, and food and ammuni
tion were rushed forward to them.
The day's fighting developed the most
determined and best-planned resistance
yet made by the Filipinos.
General Wheaton makes the follow
ing signed statement:
"I am glad to say that in to-day's
reconnoissance of the Fourth Infantry,
who held back two thousand insurgents
for three hours, the troops acted gal
lantly and with the courage and cool
ness of veterans.
"Major Bubb, commanding 1 , and

congratulations for their heroism and

Continued on Second Pace.
OTIS TO BLAME FOR THE
AMERICAN REVERSES.
MORE TROOPS NEEDED AT ONCE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 19.â With professedly friendly
natives attacking General Wheaton's troops from the rear, and with Aguinaldo's forces taking the ag
gressive instead of the defensive against the forces of General Mac Arthur and General Lawton, as
shown by dispatches during the past few days, the military situation in the Philippines has assumed an
aspeci. which seems to make a call for more troops imperative. Yet, while advices from the Philippines em
phasize the almost universal demand in this country for an immediate call for a provisional army. General
Otis remains silent on the subject. Upon him is fixed the responsibility for the delay in taking advantage of
the provision of the law contemplating the creation of a provisional army of 35.000 men for use in case of
an emergency such as now exists. The President stands ready and willing, according to all authorities here,
to promptly comply with any request General Otis may make for additional troops. Not only has General Otis
been told this, but in the last dispatch sent him on the subject, the suggestion was thrown out, I am told,
that he ought to have more troops. In answer to this his reply was the same as before â that only 30,000
trocps were necessary and desirable.
In the face of this, the President, before he left Washington, declared in the presence of his Cabinet
that as long as General Otis was in command in the Philippines his judgment as to the needs of the situation
must be paramount to recommendations from other sources. Whether he has changed his views on this point
in the light of recent developments in the Philippines, and of the general demand from the Governors of States
for an immediate increase in the military forces in the archipelago, as shown by the careful canvass of the situ
ation made by the Herald-Call, has not yet appeared.
"In the absence of the President," said Adjutant General Corbln to me to-day, "there is no compe
tent authority here to say whether or not an additional number of volunteers will be called for. All we can
properly say is that steps have been taken to give General Otis all the troops he has asked for, and that th 9
slightest intimation from him that he needs more than those already in the Philippines and those ordered to
go there, will receive prompt attention from this end of the line. There will be no trouble about organizing the
provisional army. It can be organized and under way to the Philippines within less than sixty days. Whether
it be needed I am not prepared to say. General Otis must be the judge of the situation."
The authorities are naturally very much pleased over California's promise of assistance, made in the
telegram received to-day from Senators Perkins and White, but it is stated that the offer will probably not
be accepted in the form in which it is made, even if more volunteers are called out. It is not the intention to
call for State troops under the existing organization, nor will a proclamation be issued calling up the Gov
ernors of States to furnish volunteers. The Secretary of War will simply be instructed by the President to
organize a certain number of additional regiments and call for recruits, who will be enlisted" at the various re
cruiting rendezvous, just as men are now enlisted for the regular army.
WASHINGTON. Junf 19.â The fol
lowing telegram was received
at the War Department to
day:

In response to this the following tele
gram was pent to Senator Perkins at \
San Francisco to-day:
Hon. George C. Perkins: Your telegram

ed to the President and Secretary of War.
Ir has not as yet been determined to call

H. < '. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
The following cablegram has been re- '
reived from General Otis:
MANILA. June 10.â Adjutant General,
Washington: All volunteer organizations
here desire to be mustered out in San i
Francisco. OTTS.
The cable message of General <>tis
was in response to a specific inquiry
of the War Department based upon its j
declared policy of having each volun
teer organization elect whether it i
should be mustered out at San Fran- j
cipco or its home station. It appears
from General Otis' message that the
volunteer organizations prefer to dis- ;
band at San Francisco, in accordance
with the original arrangements of the
War Department. A model camp has
WALDECK-ROUSSEAU FAILS
TO FORM A CABINET.
POINCARE MAY RESUME THE TASK
PARTS, June 20. â It was annnunred
this afternoon that Senator Wal
deck-Rousseau had declined the
task of forming a new Cabinet.
This morning: the effort he was known
to be making looked most promising.
| The Senator had informed President
Loubet that he hoped to complete the
list by to-night, and the newspapers
; were so certain that a forecast of the
i probable construction of the new Cabi
i net was given, as follows:
M. Waldeck-Rousseau, Premier and
Minister of War.
Senator Monls, Minister of Justice.
M. de la Nessena, Minister of Marine.
M. del Casse, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs.
M. Camille Krantz, Minister of Pub
lic "Works.
M. Cailleaux, Minister of Finance.
M. de LÂ«ombre, Minister of Commerce.
M. Lrf>ygues, Minister of Public In
struction.
M. Guillaine, Minister of the Colonies.
M. Lepine, Minister of the Interior.
The failure of M. Waldeck-Rousseau
is duo, it is said, to the refusal of
Camille Krantz to accept the portfolio
of Public Works, which he considered
inferior to the portfolio of War, held
by him in the retiring Cabinet. But
for this the Waldeck-Rousseau slate
was complete.
MM. Poincare and Guillaine made
their acceptance of office dependent
upon the inclusion of M. Krantz. The
latter, besides refusing the portfolio of
Public Works, pressed his disapproval
of certain measures which M. Waldeck-
Rousseau proposed to take against the
generals and colonels who recently in
spired a newspaper propaganda in fa
vor of the army.
After formal conferences to-morrow
it is expected that M. Loubet will again
summon M. Poincare.
The failure of M. Waldeck-Rousseau
makes the situation exceedingly diffi
cult. Both M. Casimir-Perier and Gen
eral Bruguiere declined to enter the
Cabinet. It is (julte uncertain whom M.
been established at San Franfiseo and
provided with every facility for the
comfort and convenience of the return
ing soldiers. It has been deemed ad
visable, from a sanitary standpoint, to
keep each organization in the camp at
least two or three weeks before permit
ting the men to go to their homes and
scatter through the country.

ANXIOUS FOR BATTLE
Ex-Senator White Believes the War

Be Ended.
SAN DIEGO, June 19. â Captain R. V.
Dodge of Company H, Seventh Regi
ment. N. G. C, of this city, the senior
captain of the regiment, states in an
interview to-day that the regiment of
i volunteers tendered to the Government
for service at Manila by Senators Per
kins and White is undoubtedly the
Seventh California. ITe has known for
some time that the m;it'Â»r of ton-ierinr
its service to thÂ» Government had been
agitated in the regiment and this
morning he received a letter from a
high official of the regiment stating
that the tender was to be made.
Captain Dodge declares that if their
services are accepted the Seventh will
go to the Philippines almost to a man.

atnr Perkins and ex-Senator White to
General Corbin being the result of his
efforts. Former Senator White to-day
expressed a desire to do all in his power
to have the regiment mustered into the
service of the United States for work
in Luzon or anywhere else in the Phil
ippines if the officers and men in the
regiment really desire to so abroad.
â¢'Some time ago," said Senator White,
"Colonel Berry said to me that he
would like to effect a reorganization of
the old Seventh Regiment, as nearly
all of the men in the regiment, officers
and privates, desired to re-enlist for
Bervice in the Philippines, ami that he
was about to till vacancies as they
might occur. Colonel Berry requested
that Senator Perkins and myself
should make a contingent tender of the
regiment to the War Department. This
was done, as I understand, and Ad
jutant General 11. C. Corbin notified me
to-day that he had received by wire an
offer of the Sevenths services to tlv?
Government, which offer would be duly
considered.
"General Corbin. in his telegram, in
form? nir I nerai Elwell 3.
Otis is entire master of the situation
and that General Otis' desires in refer
ence to now tmops will be pmniptly
complied with. The sum and substance
of the situation at present is, in my
opinion, that, nothing is, 10 be done in
the direction of additional forces for
the Philippines until General Otis so
elects.
"Personally, while T have n<=>v*Â»r
taken and do not now take the smallest
particle of stock in the Philippine ex
pansion, I believe, nevertheless, that it
is the duty of th^ Government to for
ward to Manila large forces if we are
to keep up the present fighting at all
and it appears to be settled that thÂ»
contest is to go on. A small force will
not only brine about casualties to our
selves, but will also tend to prolong the
struggle, to the disadvantage of all
concerned. It appears to me incon
sistent with the policy of the adminis
tration to continue the present unsatis
factory condition of affairs."2

SAN FRANCISCANS GO
TO VICTORIA TO WED
Dr. George M. Terrill and Miss Hut
ton United by Canon
Beanlands.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 10.â Victoria
was the Gretna Green where a romance
which was begun in San Francisco
ended this morning with the wedding !
of Dr. Ge>rge M. Terrill and Miss Hut
ton, both of San Francisco. The couple i
arrived from the Golden Gate hy the ;
steamer I'matilla yesterday and regis- j
tered at the Driard Hotel. This morn- j
ing they took a pleasant drive about '
the city, in the course of which they {
visited Christ Church Cathedral.
There they were met by Gus Hart
nagel, proprietor of the hotel, who on
short notice had agreed to act as best
man, and Rev. Canon Bean Beanlands
made the two San Franciscans man
and wife. Mrs. Beanlands supported
the bride. The ceremony was a very
s,imple and private one, and on the con
clusion "f the few formalities the party
returned to the Driards, where Canon
Beanlands and Mrs. Beanlands were
their guests at a wedding luncheon.
The clergyman was particularly im
pressed with the fact that it was the
desire of the contracting parties to
have their marriage kept private Prob
ably from this reason, or for more di
rect causes, the newly-married couple
are reported to have eloped. The
groom, however, scouted the sugges
tion. The reason for the journey to
Victoria and the secret wedding, as he
gives it, was a desire to avoid notori
ety. It is rumored that the wedding
may have an important bearing on the
disposal of property in San Francisco.
The couple leave for California on the
next steamer.

OWNERSHIP BY THE PEOPLE.
One Way to Fight the Big Trusts Be
ing Formed.
AI r STTN, Tex., June 19. -Governor Say
erÃ to-day received a lengthy letter from
Governor J. R. Rogers of the State of
Washington on the subjoet of the anti
trust movement and the proposed confer
ence of Governors and Attorney-Generals
to he held in St. Louis. Governor Rogers
says that it is his opinion that many
people are advocating State control of
trusts with insincerity, thinking in this
way to pass through the next national
campaign with safety to themselves, feel
ing sure that whatever State legislation
may !>e enacted which will really curb the
power of trusts will be eventually de
clared unconstitutional by the t'nited
States Supreme Court. He says that In
many instances so-called trusts are mere
ly larger corporations and that such cor
porations possess a v-ested and constitu
tional right to buy and sell. He concludes
by stating .that he can see no remedy for
the trust evil save public ownership, and
that he will not attend the proposed con
ference at St. Louis.
Governor William A. Stone of Pennsyl
vania writes that he will give the pro
posed conference consideration.

BITTER ATTACKS ON

London Newspapers Insist That the
American Assaulted the Ascot
Waiter.
LONDON, June 19.â The afternoon
newspapers to-day are Instating that Tod
Sloan, in Bpite of his denials, is the man
who assaulted a waiter at Ascot on
Thursday. The Evening News la Indig
nant at the fact mat the Jockey Club
hns apparently decided to let the matter
drop, and is Btirring up public feeling
against him. The paper Bays:
"The English jockeys by their behavior
and general hearing have succeeded dur
ing th. j last twenty years in totally alter
ing their social status, and it is hard
lines on them that a foreigner should
come to England and bring disgrace on
the profession without any official no
tice being taken of it. ihe next time
Sloan appears on a racecourse he will
learn what thp public think of him Th*Â»
fai t that he denies what fifty people wit
nessed may display American bravado
but in no other way will it better his po
sition."
The Star publishes several abusive let
ters, calling Sloan an "American stable
boy" and a "Mllputian Yankee " The.
same paper asserts that after careful in
vestigation it was shown that It was
Sloan and no one else who struck the
waiter with a champagne bottle com
pletely opening his lip. so (hat a large
portion of it hung over his mouth.
Tho waiter is still under the care of a
doctor.

TAMMANY AND THE
KILLARNEY LAKES
Stirred by thje Counter Action
of tf)e National Trust
Society.
NEW YORK, June 19.â Tammany has been stirred to more imme
diate action by the cablegram to the effect that the Duke of Westmin
ster and others of the National Trust Society of England had begun a
counter movement for the purchase of the Lakes of Killarney. A num
ber of district leaders were gathered informally at Tammany Hall this
morning and the proposed purchase of the lakes was discussed. It is
said that Tammany will depend largely upon the wishes and efforts of
Mr. Croker in the purchase and preservation of this historic property.
"Mr. Croker Is on the scene," said a prominent officer of Tammany.
"He is very much interested personally in the proposed purchase of Kil
larney and believes that Irish-Americans should take advantage of the
sale and secure the lakes. Thus far Tammany has pledged its support
to the scheme. We are depending, as I have said, upon what Mr. Croker
says. Until his return I do not think that any definite announcement
will be made. If we decide to purchase Killarney Ido not believe How
ard Gould will stand in our way. Tammany is made of men who would
hold the spot sacred. It is their native land and it will not* be like an
alien."

SEQUEL TO THE SUBURBAN
SUSPICION AGAINST RIDER OF
BANASTAR.
No Charges Are Preferred, but the
Millionaire Turfman Drops a
Rather Significant
Remark.
S[>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 19.â 1n the Daisy
stakes at Sheepshead Bay to-day Neda
and Jlisericordia were equal favorites. It
was little more than a walk-over for
Neda, for she won all the way. Central
Trust took the sixth race by a head from '
Intrusive. Her time (1:47) equaled the;
track record.
\Y. H. Clark, the owner of Banastar, fa
vorite of the Suburban, ordered Jockey
Maher away from his stables to-day and
told him he could not ride for him or any
one else during this and next year. Mr.
Clark has the jockey under contract for
1899 and 1900. and says he prefers to pay
him the $10,'K)0 a year to stay on the
ground. He mak^s no direct charges that
Banastar was pulled in the big race of
.Saturday, but declares he will protect
other owners.
Whether or not Mr. Clark has ground
for a suspicion that Maher acted dishon
estly, ho was incensed because the jockey
failed to get Banastar away from the
post in the Suburban, and then cruelly
and shamefully belabored the poor beast
without the slightest cause. Maher, who
is under contract with Mr. Clark to ride
for two years. a 1 a salary of $10,000 per
annum, has been instructed tn call at his
employer's office every three months to
collect lv's salary. He must at all times
remain away from the stable. He cannot

on the race track without bis employer's
consent, which practically means banish

FAST SEVEN FURLONGS.
Donald Bain Covers the Distance in
1:25 3-4 at Hawthorne.
CHICAGO. June 19.â Wiliam Hayos'
three-year-old colt Donald Bain, by
Strathmore-Gladness, to-day ran seven
furlongs at the Hawthorne track in
1:25%. This is the fastest time ever made
In the West and the fastest, with one ex
ception, ever made In the United States.
The exception Is the performance of Clif
ford, who as a four-year-old, carrying 127
pounds, ran the distance at Shee.pshead
on August 29 1894. in 1:25 2-5.
Donald Bain carried 104 pounds, seven
below the scale. The fastest seven fur
longs previously run at Hawthorne was
by Pop Gray on May 1. 1595. when, carry
ing 104 pounds, he as a four-year-old won
easily In 1:2(!H- Harry Puke at Nash
ville, Timekeeper at St. IvOuis. Caesarl.in
and Byron McClelland at Oakley and
Buck Massie at Harlem had all mad-? the
distance in 1;26 flat, but in every Instance
carried light weights. On this account
Donald Bain's performance was sensa
tional. Several watches on the outside,
caught the time as l:2riVz. some even less.
But after all the real glory in the race
belongs with Brigade, the unlucky ?h^st
nut son of Hayden Edwards, for he was
only a head away at the finish and catch
ing the winner at every jump. At the
start Donald Bain had clear sailing, while
Brigade, along with some of the other*.
was interfered with by the crazy Jolly
Roger, who cut across the track just as
the flag fell. Results:

PRIZE-WINNING TRUST
FORMED BY CYCLISTS
McFarland and Stevens Aid Each
Other to Victories on the
National Circuit.
YEW YORK, June 19.â A prize-winning
trust has been formed by two prominent
professional ryollsts, now following- the
circuit of thfi National Cycling Associa
tion. The combination is the most unique
in tho history of trusts and likewise in
the annals of / cycle-racing. That it Is
richly remunerative to Us promoters all
other prominent profppsionals on the cir
cuit can attest to their sorrow.
Floyd McFarland, the attenuated rider
from San Jose, Cal., and Orlando Stevens,
the stooky athlete from Ottumwa, Iowa!
compose the trust, and so far their com
bination has been entirely satisfactory to
themselves. After less than one month
of racing the pair have earned upward of
$3000, which Is considers bliy more than
half of all the money prizes given at the
meets attended by them.
T'p to the present time McFarland has
been doing the bulk of the winning, more
or less ably assisted by Stevens, who has
not yet attained his partner's form. Sev
eral times, however, the former has sacri
ficed himself for the sake of the latter.
This was notably the case at Vailsburg
N. J., on Sunday, when McFarland aided
Stevens In winning both professional
races on the card. In both the Califor
nian made the pace for his team mate,
running second In one race and withdraw
ing before the finish of the other.
On the previous Sunday at the same
track Stevens was a winner.
Kenny (Jets the Decision.
NEW YORK, June IP.â At the Coney

received the decision over Ed Dunkhorst
of Syracuse in a twenty-five round bout
Dunkhorst weighed 250 pounds; Kenny 190*
Kenny was the aggressor from first to
last, but In two roundsâ the twelfth and
the sixteenthâ Dunkhorst landed hf-avllv
and had "Yank" momentarily on QueeV
street. In both of these rounds, however
the Detroit man recovered quickly and'
he had the big fellow groggy before the
gong sounded. In the closing round both
men were too far gone to do any harm
and although "Yank" landed repeat. >l lv

"GASHIE" STEIN'S
LATEST SWINDLE
Cut-Rate Store Run as
a Blind.
MANY MERCHANTS DUPED
GOODS RESHIPPED FROM SAN
JOSE TO A FENCE.
San Francisco Wholesalers Now Have
Detectives Searching for the
Ex-Convict and His Nim
ble Partner.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SAN JOSE. Juno If*. -San Francisco de
tectives are anxious to discover the
whereabouts "of "Gashie" Stein and part-
I nor, who. under the nnnv of D. Jacobson
j & Co.. conducted a "cot-rate" grocery
! store at E3S South First street-. T-he store
was opened about a month a^". but eloped
its doors on June 12. Jt was ;i!l its name
implied in cut rates. Local dealers could
not understand how the firm sold goods
below the wholesale cost.
It has now leaked out thai â¢â¢â¢ â¢ store w.isw
merely run as a blind to hunk" San Fran-T
Cisco wholesalers out of bills of fÂ» lods. D.
Jacobson turned out to bi shie"
Stein, ex-convtet. and clever confiden.ce
man. His companion has not been iden
tified yet.
The firm appeared to have an immense
stock on hand, and local creditors did not
press claim?. To-day It was learned that
all these cases Were < mpty and had been
nailed securely to the floor to allay thi
suspicion of any one who mtcht try to
lift them. A large 1 safe also gave th<Â»
place the look of a substantial business
house. _1
The Board of Trad, of San Francisco
became convinced that all was not ripht
with the firm of Jarobson & Co. a few
days ago, and detectives wer.- put to work
on the case. A number of Who
houses had been worked. Stein and his
partner would buy a large bill of goons
from a firm, paying cash.
Shortly after he would" tret another hip
order and ask sixty days' tiny; on it. In
this manner he obtained about RS(#O worth
of goods. These were shipped to this
city and then reshlpped to a fence in San
Francisco.
The swindle was discovered by a rail
road man and the -poods seized at the
San Francisco depot. Stein and his part
! nt-r skipped as soon a* it was learned
! their game was discovered.
The store hns been attached by the San
Francisco Board of Trade on claim:
! gregatingr $4*o. Another attachment is for
: $100 due for clerk hire. The stock now in
the store is estimated to be worth $75.

*. , ADVERTISEMENTS.
Out oil the water in the moonlight. A
more beautiful or romantic situation for a
young man to tell the story of his love and
.ask the young woman of his choice. to share
his life cannot be imagined. " : '
The courtship of a young couple may be
ever so romantic and their married life be
very unhappy. There are common sense
considerations outside of love that have a
world to do with the making of married
happiness. One of the most important of
these considerations is the good health of
both parties to the sacred tie. The young
man who is in the incipient stages of con-
sumption commits a crime if he marries
before he is restored to health. He con-
demns his wife to the life of a nurse and
his children, to early death, or lives of sick-
ness and suffering. ; Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery cures 98 per cent, of all
rases of consumption if taken in its earlier
stages. This is its record established dur-
ing the past thirty years. It is the great
blood-maker, flesh-builder, nerve-tonic and
general restorative.
The young woman who suffers from weak-
ness and disease of the delicate and im-
portant organs that make wifehood and
motherhood possible has no right to answer
"Yes" to a young man's proposal until she
is thoroughly restored to health in a wom-
anly way. Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip-
tion prepares a woman for wifehood and
motherhood. It makes her strong, healthy
and vigorous where a woman most needs
health, strength and vigor. Thousands of
women have testified to its merits.
" My daughter," writes Mrs. N. A. Thomas, of
Little Rock, Ark., " had been under a doctor's
care for four years. Dr. Pierces Favorite Pro- 1
Bcription, which cured me, also cured her."

KuljHtn.TUi.ttM this statement by calling at
tention to ihf fact that Badaracco, who
took Av.->l;,na's place in "Trovatore"
when Avedana signed, scored the big

to hear him in the title role has been so
great that the opera was produced last
Sunday evening and will again be heard

Dr. Zorn is discreetly reticent regarding

obtained the Impression at Berlin that a l
hope need not be aband< ned of effecting
an understanding regarding the organ

a decision this week. Matters therefore
remain unchanged, and the drafting c>m

THERE IS YET HOPE
FOR ARBITRATION
WASHINGTON, June 19.â Advices re
ceived by Secretary Hay from the Ameri
can delegation to The Hague conference
Indicate the confidence of the delegates
that the plan of International arbitration
will be adopted by the conference. The
opposition of Germany and other powers
to the American plan makes it certain
that that plan will not be adopted, and it
was said by a high official of the adminis
tration to-day that this Government
would be satisfied if the conference would
agree to the scheme based upon three
propositions made by representatives of
Russia, Great Britain and the United
Stat'-s. He thinks it probable From Infor
mation he has from The Hague that the
suggestion contained in the American plan
thai members of the tribunal be desip
natnii by the Judiciaries of the several
nations will be Incorporated by the arbi
tration committee in the final scheme sub
mitted to the conference. It would not be
surprising, it is stated, if th<- conference
should agree to provide an administrative
committee to conduct affairs of arbitra
tion ami prescribe the scope of Questions
to be submitted to the arbitration tri
bunal, and be reaily to submit its report
within ten days or twn weeks. The au
thorities have given up hope that t ho
propositions of the United States for th.Â»
protection of private property at sea and
amelioration of the hardships of war will
be adopted, and arp bending every effort
to secure the acceptance of an arbitration
resolution by the conference.

The Two Secombs, Who Lost Their
Lives, Will Be Buried in One
Casket at San
Rafael.
Ppo^ial Dispatch to The <"-all.
PAN RAFAEL, June 19.â An inquest
was held to-day over the remains of
the four unfortunate men who lost their
lives in the explosion which wrecked
the Vnited States Smokeless Powder
Works on Saturday. At th- conclusion
of the inquest the jury rendered a ver
dict of "death from accidental causes,"
in accordance with the testimony.
Owing to the various sensational ru
mors in circutation, a lar^' 1 crowd had
assembled at the Morgue by 9 o'clock, i
but Tt dispersed when Coroner Eden
announced that as John Farrell and
Frank Webster were unable to leave
their beds the jury would have to pro
ceed to the Tamalpals Hotel. After
both men had told their stories the
jury returned to the Morgue and lis
tened to th<' testimony of Superintend
ent Starke, Foreman Rehnert and John
Downey.
Superintendent Starke asserts thin
the tale of Peter Moran regarding the
overheating of drying boxes, as pub
lished to-day, was due to malice, Moran
having been discharged for careless
ness and incnrnpetenoy. Moran, in fart,
acknowledges that he was discharged
and did not quit work In fear of an
explosion.
Frank Hollenbeck's aged mother ar
rived from Martinez this morning and
had her son's body placed in a casket |
and sent home, where the funeral will ;
take place to-morrow. The remains of i
the two Becombs, father and son. will !
be interred in one casket at Mount
Olivet Cemetery to-morrow. Morrisey
will be laid away at the same time.
President Timothy Hopkins and three
directors of the company came to this
city from San Francisco this morning
and were driven to the site of the
powder works. After a cursory in
spection of the ruins they returned to
town and left on the next train.
The Jury Disagreed.

SCIENCE MAY CONQUER FOG.
"Electric Cohesion" Promises to Turn
Mist Into Rain at Will.
In the course of a Royal Institution
lecture on "Coherers," Professor Oliver
Lodge m;iil<' ; i n experiment which may
have an important bearing in the abate
ment of the smoke nuisance. Tie filled a
hell jar with magnesium smoke. Ordi
i narily these thick fumes would take a
' long time to disperse. I>r. Txidge passed
;< charge of electricity through the jar,
â¢ and the smoke began Instantly to clear,
1 the smoke particles uniting and falling In
the form of white snow of magnesia. â¢ The
. word used to describe this action of the
: Bmoke particles is electric "cohesion."
i The explanation of it. Dr. Lodge said, is
beyond our scientific knowledge, and it is j
! one <>f thnsr- great problems < > f electricity
i which we hope that Lord Kelvin may
' solve. It is perhaps enough to say at this
point that it is this quality of electric
cohesion which makes Hertzian wireless
telegraphy possibleâ by the use of sensi
tive electric devices called "coherers,"
which, like the r< ceiver of a telephone,
serve to indicate certain forms of elec
tric waves. Hut Dr. Lodge incidentally !
referred to B possible extension on a large ;
scale of his magnesium Bmoke experi
ment.
"Some people," said he. "may Imagine \
that this experiment suggests a means. of I
dispersing London fog. An adaption of
some such method might be suitable for;
the dispersion of real fog, of sea fog. of
fog arising from a moisture-charged at
mosphere.
"A Scotch mist can be turned into rain
by a suitable discharge of electricity, and !
ordinary rain can be changed into the !
large drops of a thunder shower by the j
electric discharge of the. lightning flash. |
The reason for the size of the drops is
that, owing to the incident of electric
'cohesion.' the drops are attracted to one
another and form conglomerate drops.
Hut I don't think electricity could prevent
London fog. The only way to prevent a
London fog is not to cause it. And the
way not to cause it Is not to burn coal
fires, like savages, in open grates. The
day will come when it will be forbidden
to import crude coal into Tendon. I con- !
fess I should like to see the experiment >
tried of making gap at the great coal i
fields and of conveying it to the town in
huge pipes and conduits. The experiment, i
Of course, could not be made with re- i
Bpect to London; it would have to be
conducted on too large a scale, but it I
might be tried with a small town. It will <
have to come to that some day. People

NEVADA CITY, June 19.â The Moore
murder case, which has been on trial
for six days past, will go to the jury to
morrow afternoon. The popular opin
ion to-night is that he will be con
victed, but there is much doubt ex
pressed as to the likelihood of his hang
ing.
After the defense introduced addi
tional testimony this morning: as to the
outlaw's insanity matter of the
competency of Francis N. Burns as a
witness for the defense was taken up.
Burns claims to have sp^n the killing
of Kilroy, and alleges that Moore shot
the policeman in self-defense. Dr. A.
H. Tickell was called as an expert by
the people. He declared he had exam
ined Burns and found him to be so
crazy he could not be depended upon.
Judge Nilon ruled that Burns' testi
mony should not be taken and the de
fense rested.
The District Attorney called Dr. R.
M. Hunt and some thirty more wit
nesses in rebuttal of the insanity plea
and they all pronounced Moore to be of
sound mind. Late in the afternoon
both sides rested.
Retained in Office.

Special I>ispatch to The Call.
BERLIN", June 19.â During the course of
the debate- in the Reichstag to-day
Herr Leiberman yon Sonneberg at
tacked Great Britain's proceedings
in Samoa. The Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, Baron yon Bulow. replied, saying:
"I have no objection to again define our
attitude on the Samoan question. We
shall not depart from the stipulations of
the Samoan treatynor allow Great Britain
,to turn us from our course. We recognize
the rights of others while maintaining our
own."
Baron yon Bulow next mentioned the
departure from Samoa of Admiral Kautz,
E. B. S. Maxse, the British Consul, and
Herr Rose, the German Consul, and the
release of Herren Huff and Marquardt,
the two Germans arrested during the
troubles, "after the commission has as
sured itself of their complete innocence,"
and then continued :
"The first wirk of the commission will
be the restoration of peace and legal con
ditions, in conformity with the Samoa act.
It would be in accordance with article 1!
of the act if In the settlement of the fu- :
ture government the wish of the inhabit
ants was consulted by a majority vote of
the recognized chiefs and by a mure ex
tended vote of the people. But, I repeat â 
emphatically that we will take no side in
tlx- local disputes or In regard to the can- !
didates for the throne. We do not approve
of the partisanship of the agents or other ;
powers In behalf of MaMetoa Tanu.
"Another task before us is to see our:
subjects in Samoa indemnified, in accord
ance with the principles of the laws of na
tions, for losses through destruction >>f
property or Illegal arrest. (Loud cheers.)
This question, however, will only be ripe
for diplomatic action after the restora
tion of order.
"I hope the activity of the commission â 
will result in a just and equitable settle
ment. We will noi cede any of our rights,
but at the same time vv.- do not forget ;
that complicated international disputes
must be treated with quiet deliberation
and in cool blood."
The Minister read dispatches outlining
the situation as already fully known, the
only n< w points being the German Com- \
mission cr 'a statement that the commis
sion received both Malletoa and Mataafa
as having equal rights as party Leaders,
and the announcement that the possibility
of strife may be ended by the abolition of i
the kingship.
WILL SOLICIT FUNDS.
Fourth of July Finance Committee
to Ask for Assistance.
At a meeting hf the finance committee
of the Fourth of July celebration, held j
yesterday at the offices of Chairman Wil- !
Ham J. Herrin, it was decided to solicit |
subscriptions. The recommendations of'
the various committees for estimated ex
penditures, which had been submitted to
the executive committee, were read, in
which it appeared that $4100 would be re
quired for a proper celebration, heirs
$1100 in excess of the amount appropriated
by the Board of Supervisors..
Considerable discussion followed on the
advisability of asking the public to con
tribute. Some of the members asserted
that $3000 would be sufficient, while others
suggested that the celebration be post
poned until the California Volunteers re
turned from the Philippines.
J. E. Wilkins finally made a motion,
which was carried, that contributions be
solicited from downtown business men by
the members of the committee so as to
bring the total amount tip to $4500. Each i
member will be provided with a subscrip- j
tion book, used for the celebration in 1597, !
and, considering the fact that over five j
hundred dollars has already been sub- :
scribed by various concerns, the commit
tee should experience little or no trouble
in obtaining the balance. Soliciting will
begin to-day, and it is expected that the
required amount will be collected in a few !
days.
The parade committee reports that the
Chinese Native Sons will turn out with a
band and float and Chinese features to
match. The Six Companies met Saturday
evening and decided to contribute all the
expenses of their turnout. The fishermen
have signified their intention to turn out
300 strung with a float. The Native
Daughters have also expressed an inten
tion to parade and to carry out any sug
gestions made by the committee as to
formation and features. The Japanese of
the town are also prepared to turn out
with day fireworks as their contribution,
and there are many other organizations
which are preparing but have not yet
given official notice of the fact.
ANOTHER DRAMATIC CIRCUIT.
Oliver Morosco Secures the Theater at
Los Angeles for the Entering
Wedge.
Oliver Morocco has just returned from
Los Angeles, where he has succeedei in
securing the Burbank Theater, which he
will assume possession of about the Ist
of next September. This is but the enter
ing wedge in the accomplishment of a
project which Mr. Morosco entertains for
the encouragement of the best dramatic
talent. It is his design in the near future
to secure a theater in Sacramento, San
Jose, Fresno, Oakland, Marysville, etc.. to
constitute a State circuit for the compa
nies which he proposes to engage.
The Los Angeles theater will be opened
with an Eastern combination, and the
people of that city and San Francisco will
be treated to the best that is on thc'blll?.
It is Mr. Morosco's hope if the State \en
ture should prove a success to control a
Pacific Coast circuit, but that will not bo
for some time yet.
Templars' Annual Banquet.
Next Saturday night Golden Gate Com
mandery, Knights Templar, will give its
annual banquet in Golden Gate Asylum,

In Creat Britain there are said to be
nearly 300 religious sects. The adher

cially put down at 13,000,000. but. ac
cording to other authorities, this is <n
exaggeration. The year books and re
ports of the evangelical free churches
for ls!<.S-99 give the total sitting ac
commodations in their churches at
7 848,804, whereas the total number of
sittings in the established church is
6,886,977.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, June 19.â Up to 4
o'clock this afternoon this promised to
be the most uneventful day in the big
strike. At that hour another serious
riut broke out in an entirely new quar
ter and one non-union man was sent
to the hospital in consequence.
The company began to-day the opera
tion of two new lines â those on ScoVille
and Centra] avenues. The cat's were
I protected by policemen. Just before 4
o'clock two of the Scovllle-aVenue cars
approached the crossing of the Penn
sylvania Railroad. There they were
I met by a mob of more than 2000 men
| and wofheh. One of the cars was taken
across the railroad safely, but the other
was held up by the mob. A perfect
shower of paving bricks and stones fell
about the car and crashed against the
. vestibule at the Eront end, behind which
the motorfnan was concealed. Women
threw bricks and handed them to the
, who were in the front of the
crowd. The windows <>f the car had
been lowered and the, bricks crashed
against the seats and fell upon the
floor of the car. The conductor es
caped injury, but the motormah, A. J.
McGrew of St. L<>uis. was struck on
: the head with a brick and rendered un- I
conscious. He was taken to a hospi
tal. The* patrolman on the ear was hit I
by a bri< k.
A call was made for the police, but
\vh< n a del nt of officers arrived
the mob had dispersed and no arrests
wt re made.
A demonstration, which had l n
planned for to-nighi to Influence the
I City Council in favor of an ordinance
prohibiting the employment of motor
men \\h" have not had ten days' ex
perience operating cars in this city,
â  consisted of a parade in the down
town streets, with torchlights, drum
corps and bass bands. A crowd of
sembled, but all of them
rlid not parade. The crowd was dem
onstrative, bul not disorderly.
At the meeting of the Council there
vas a scene of gjreal disorder. The !
ry and lobby of the chamber were
packed by a large crowd and every
speaker who was inclined to give the
: railroad company a fair show was
hissed. This continued until Mayor
Farley made a sp< h in which he
declared that he did not propose to sub
mit to intimidation. The ordinance
fixing the requirements for motormen
was passed under a suspension of the
rules. The resolution was adopted
requesting the Corporation Counsel to
report whether the franchises of the
company could iwt be forfeited if it
failed to run cars on all its lines.
GRAIN FIRE NEAR WINTERS.
Match Dropped in a Load of Hay
Starts a Conflagration.
WOODLAND, June 19.â A special to the
Democrat from "Winters says: A grain
Held fire occurred on the farm of Ed
Graff, three miles north of this place, be
nd ( i o'clock Saturday evening.
William Burrows and A. D. Johnson were
hauling hay from the Graff place to the
farm Of J. F. 'SrifTiri. a distance of about
three miles. They had the wagon loaded
and were driving through the field, when
they discovered that- the hay In th<^ rear
'end of the wagon was on lire. The whole
wagon and contents w< re soon totally de
stroyed, and one of the mules was badly
scorched before the men could unhitch the
team.
Tlie tire was scattered along the route
traveled by the wagon, and the growing
grain In the Held was soon on fir" and
vast destruction was threatened. By the
hard work of those at the scene and Lhe
assistance of the fin- extinguisher brigade
of this place, which hastened to the fire
as soon as the alarm was given, tne
flames were finally extinguished, but not
until twenty-five acres of growing wheat
had been destroyed.
.M~r. Graff owned the grain, ami it was
partially insured. Mr. (JriHin owned the
wagon and contents and the mules. The
origin of the tire is not known, but it. is
presumed that it started from a match
which had been accidentally dropped In
the wagon.

TELEPHONE LINE
OF BARBED WIRE
Farmers ground Le Grand to Put
in a UQique System of
CommuQication.
STOCKTON, June 19.â The rural community in and around the vil
lage of Le Grand, a few miles out on the Valley line, proposes to have
a telephone system of its own. Some time ago the originators of the anti
monopoly enterprise asked the Sunset Telephone Company to extend its
lines to their booming section, but the company did not think the line
would pay sufficient dividends, and so curtly refused the petition. At
first the Le Grandites were mad, hut later they did some thinking, with
the result that they evolved a scheme which, if followed in other farm
ins sections, will turn many a dollar from the coffers of the corpora
tion.
'Their independence is due to the fact that barbed wire is the pre
vailing material used for fences and the wire will carry an electrical
current. They have engaged the services of an expert electrician, who
is putting in the necessary connections and attachments and all tests
made so far indicate that the line will give as much satisfaction as
though it had been erected by the telephone octopus.
Following the Valley railroad track is a continuous barb wire fenoe
from I-egrande to Merced, with branches running tn every direction.
Through the courtesy of the railroad a switchboard will be put in one
of the depot rooms and a fairly good system rigged up.
The people of Le Grand are quite enthusiastic over the scheme and are
contributing liberally to the cost of building. No trouble in the opera
tion of the line during the dry senson is expected, but some provision
must he made for the rainy period, as the damp posts would "ground"
the circuit. The scheme is not an experiment, as the electrician who is
putting in the system has put several into successful operation in the
Kastern States. The farmers' families are much elated over the facilities
which the line will afford them to indulge in social conversations at
long range.

DANGER OF RUNNING INTO THE

: Comment on the Conduct of the Ad

and a Report to the Navy
Department.
Special Dispatch to 7h* rail.
WASHINGTON, June lft.â The occtir
rences on thf bridge <>t the Brooklyn <lur
â¢ >\f hattle of July 3. having been the
subject <'f a controversy in the hewspa
' pers. the Navy Department recently
undertook an investigation of the various
nations. Lieutenant rnminander
Hodgson and Lieutenant Commander
Hellner, who have figured in the contro
versy, were both called upon for explana
tions of the utterances attributed to them,
and the former was directed to report for
examination on this point to Captain
1 Chadwick at Boston. The department h;is
now given out for publication <'aptain
Chadwick's report on the matter. It is
not yet determined whether or not the
answer of Lieutenant Commander Hetl
ner will be made public' at this time.
Ohadwiek's report is as follows:
U. S. S. New York, Boston, Mass., June 17,
i 1899.â Sir: In obedience to your orders of the
: 12th lnst, I have to report the following as the |
I statement by lieutenant Commander Hodg- i
: son of the conversation between Rear Ad- j
! miral Schley and himself during the action of
: July 3, IS9S. He states as follows: "As we
were approaching the Spanish ships I heard
â  Admiral Bchley say 'Port or starboard sev
eral times to Captain Cook in the conning
tower the admiral being on the platform sur- j
rounding the conning tower. I had been on j
the bridge above and was Just coming down
to report the position of the ship when I heard i
. the admiral say 'Hard a port. 1 The Maria
â¢ Teresa was then hauling abaft our port beam.
The Brooklyn was heading about northeast.
; 1 told the admiral, or at least suggested to
i him. that the Texas was very close on our
1 starboard hand and that turning to starboard
i would bring: us close to her. I don't know that
'' 1 used the word 'collision.' I did not say 'you
mean starboard.' I intended him to under
! stand there was danger of running- into the
' Texas. He said 'All right,' or words to that
j effectâ l cannot repeat verbatim. When I
. knew he was going to turn to starboard 1
suggested backing the starboard engine in or
' der to make a smaller circle and give the
Texas a wider berth, but he decided against
that as decreasing the speed of the turn. He
, did not say. that 1 know of. 'We are near
: enough to them (the Spaniards) already.' The
only thing I gathered from what he said was
that if we turned to port we should get so
close that we should expose ourselves to tor
pedo attacks. I suppose he meant torpedo
boats and replied to him that I had not seen
Lieutenant Commander Hodgson states that
he did not Intend to convey in his note of j
denial sent at the request of Admiral Schley,
and published In the Washington Post, the!
Idea that no such colloquy took place. He
states, regarding this, as follows: Admiral
Schley wrote me. inclosing an editorial from
a New Tork paper of June 1. asking me to
1 write a denial of what he phrased "an oft
repeated calumny." He said he had no recol
lection of any such conversation. 1 wrote a
lengthy letter of explanation giving my recol
lection of the conversation as nearly as possi
ble. Admiral Schley wrote me, saying: ''There
is "much In your letter which I should not like |
to use, as it would provoke an assault upon \
you. which I would not like to happen. What !
I want to show is that the dialogue did not
i occur" I then wrote a denial of the colloquy, j
certainly not intending that no such colloquy i
occurred but that It did not occur as printed. :
At the same time. I sent with this an ex- |
planatory letter explaining to Admiral Schley
1 that the letter of denial was a denial of the
dialogue as It appeared in print, and that I
bad told the correspondent of the paper that
the substance of the conversation was correct. ,
1 In writing the letter I wished to refute the
fact of any controversy existing at a critical
stage of the battle. It (the letter) was a !
denial of the. words as they stood In the '
â  published article, a denial of their literal cor- ;
rectness and not a denial of the substantial
correctness of the statement."
A copy of the letter has not been retained '
i by him: he had a rough draft which has been
mislaid. Lieutenant Commander Hodgson ap-
p ends his signature as a voucher for the ac
curacy with which the foregoing is given. Very
respectfully, F. X CHADWICK,

GRAVESTONE OF BASALT.
Natural Monument to Be Reared Over
the Tomb of Mrs. Watts.
HEALDSBTJRO, June 19.â 1,. S. Watts
of Ran Francisco, field assistant in the
State Mining Bureau, who lost his wife
I pome time ago, formed the Idea of secur
! ing a natural basalt monument for her
j grave. The matter was placed in the
I hands of T. C. Mathyas, the mineralogist,
j formerly of the Mining: Bureau. Last week
i Mr. Mathyas found on Mill Creek, three
I miles from Healdsburg, probably the best
specimen of basalt in the State. It is
I twelve feet long and consists of four col
umns stuck together, weighing probably
16,000 pounds. The shafts are six-sided
; crystal prisms, and vary in thickness
from a few inches to three feet. George
; W. Mill? of Healdsburg has undertaken to
place the monument on the cars for ship
! ment to San Francisco, and expects to
land it at the depot on Monday. He has
strengthened the various bridges it will
be necessary to pass over, but will not
risk the long suspension bridge over Dry
Creek and will cross the bed of that
stream.

NEEDS OF THE
CITY'S HARBOR
AND FRONTAGE
Substantial Wharves
Should Be Built.
COMMERCIAL MEN'S VIEWS.
SEAWALL OUGHT TO BE EX
TENDED SOUTH AND WEST.
Immediate Need of the State Appro
priating One Million Dollars
to Accomodate the
Shipping.
Some time ago the active members of j
the Chamber of Commerce decided that ;
they wanted more information and knowl- '
edge as to the facilities of the harbor
front for handling the commerce, pres- ;
ent and future, of San Francisco. To thin
end a special committee was appointed to
investigate harbor front affairs. The com
mittee consisted of' John Dolbeer (chair
man), Robert Dollar, R. J. Chapman, ;
Edward E. Kentfleld and W. H.
Marston. Yesterday the gentlemen made
public their report, which is as follows:
Dear Sirs: The special committee appointed !
by your honorable body to investigate matters
pertaining to the harbor and water front
bee to report as follows: We did not suppose
it was Intended so much now to go into the j
past history of the management of the water
iront, Inasmuch as that has been quite thor- I
oughly investigated by the special committee ;
for the State Senate, and a report made to
that body accordingly, but rather to look' more j
particularly into the present status of the fa- i
cilities afforded to the shipping interests and .
see what improvements, if any, could be sug
gested applicable both to the present and fu- i
ture needs of our commercial interests. We '
have had several conferences with members of
the Board of State Harbor Commissioners and
their engineer, Mr. Howard C. Holmes, as '
well as meeting the board In session, to ail of
whom we desire to extend our thanks for their >
assistance and courtesy. A reduction has re- !
cently been made In the expenses of the State
Harbor Commissioners, particularly in reduc
ing the force employed. The amount thus
saved, being not less than $2500 per month, this I
action is most commendable and one greatly :
needed. We trust, however, that the same
spirit of economy and retrenchment will con
tinue to prevail and result in. much additional j
saving. From the accounts presented it ap- i
pears that the expenditure for the year end- '
ing June 30, 1SÂ»8, exceeded the receipts
120,683 29. Expenditures include amount $.".:..
--572 transferred from San Francisco harbor im
provement fund to depot sinking fund, but
not Including disbursements paid out of depot
fund. The amount, $55,572. being for Interest I
on the $600,000 depot bonds and to provide a I
fund for their redemption.
Wharfage and Tolls- Owing to the urgent
need of funds, not only to maintain the ef- !
ficiency, of the present structures, but to pro
vide means for extending the seawall and
building new wharves, we do not suggest any j
reduction in the charges now made for wharf- |
age and tolls, believing it more expedient to
have suitable and ample accommodations for
I our commerce than to effect a small saving on
each cargo. In the future when such large
expenditures for maintenance and construe- !
tion may not be necessary, it will then be i
time to consider the matter of reducing these I
charges. Taking the case of say a 2000-ton |
failing ship, the charge of lying at the wharf I
now is about $17 50 per day. but should such j
a vessel be kept In the stream, unable to find !
i suitable dockage, it would not be unreasonable j
! to estimate the cos) at $100 per day for the .
time of the vessel. !
Accommodationâ find that from time to I
; time complaint has been made of lack <>'â  ac- i
; commodation for vessels at the wharves, hut !
upon careful consideration we are satisfied that |
it has not been so much for lack of apace ;
as for want of acceptable room convenient to I
some particular locality or at a covered wharf. I
but admitting this, we certainly would recom
mend that such steps be taken as . will pro- .
vide sufficient berths of. the. kind needed. We
find also In some instances berths desirable, for
handling general cargo, are occupied almost
permanently by coal barges, and recommend
that these should be moved when any vessel I
requires the space for loading or discharging. ;
While it may true also that tor the present
number of vessels in the harbor some kind '
of accommodation may be found, we feel cer
tain that in the autumn months when the
whaling, sealing and salmon fleet arrive, not
to speak of such vessels as will then come
to load our wheat and other products there
â will not be room enough.
New wharvesâ ln order, therefore, to help to
pome extent to obviate this difficulty, which
we believe imminent and which will result In j
great loss caused by vessels waiting for berths, |
we respectfully recommend that a new wharf
! of the most modern character be built im
mediately north of the Fishermen's wharf,
! between It and the Lombard-street ferry slips.
In order to do this It will be necessary to |
; change these slips by doing away with Slip
No. 1 and making in its place a slip between
: No. 2 and Lombard-Street pier, also extending
: the southern side of Slip No. 2 at the proper .
angle out to the regular pier line: running :
j from this end a line of piles to the seawall !
i and at a right angle to It. thus obliterating :
Slip No. 1 and gaining one side of a wharf I
â  and a large area back of It for handling cargo
: and freight. This work, we think, should he j
! started immediately, as preliminary steps for
i Increasing the facilities of the water front ,
I cannot be undertaken too soon. We further
| suggest that the Fishermen's wharf be re- i
! moved and an extra large covered pier be built |
â  in its place. In this way two fine wharves
I could be obtained. The Fishermen's wharf I
could be moved to the end of Section B of the \
sea wall, near the foot of Jones street. The
sea wall could be partially extended to form
-,i breakwater which afterward would serve as
a foundation for the permanent structure in the
future, the Rpace thus .-!..s<-.i in between the
breakwater an.i the present shore line afford
ing protection for the fishing boats.
Seawall The foregoing suggestion naturally
brings us t>> a consideration of the seawall.
I In our opinion, tt is very necessary that this
' wr.rk he extended southerly fr.'in its present
terminus. As this wall Is completed, new and
substantial piers could i>e built and so ar
! ranged that about double the accommodation
i now afforded between ferry slips and Pacific
Mall dock be obtained.
p rPS( . n t condition of. wharvesâ Owing to the
i mann<r of construction and the ravages Âf
! the Tereiio Navalia and I,lmnoria, we realized
' that the expenditure of large amounts of
money is necessary to keep the present piers
! in repair and note that the Commissioners
hiive recently lei contracts for repairing How
ard-street wharf No. 1 and No. 2. also Harrl
son-street wharf.
Wharf structure In this connection we de
sire to recommend the system of construction
so ably advocated by the Kngineer, Mr. H. C.
i Holmes, and demonstrated in I'ier No. 7 and
. Pier No. 12. These structures rest on piers
each composed Of concrete surrounding a BUit
i able number of piles, generally three, and mi
i eloped in iron boiler casing. We also fully
â  Indorse the plan of making the new wharves
; jno feet wide or more, which wo understand
is recommended by the Commissioners. and
where practicable SOO feet long instead of about
enn fert as at present. Also, that in the con
i struct ion of new wharves, the aim should be
; to give af much additional covered space as
will be found convenient, such being partlou
-1 larly desirable tor discharge of general mer
! chandlse cargo. As a further means of afford
i ing additional wharf room, we recommend the
suggestion of H. C. Holmes, made in his re
port, that a large pier or breakwater be con
structed at a sufficient distance north from
Pier No. 27 to afford say four wharves be
tween them. This pier to be filled in solidly
! and be 800 feet long and about 100 feet wide,
so made that vessels could lie alongside and
1 afford a means of bringing car and ship lo
i gether by having railroad tracks laid on It.
Being solid it would offer the best method of
carrying a suitable sewer out to the end into
1 deep water and offer protection from the !
north wind and swell coming in from the
ocean. Also following the suggestion Âf Mr. j
Holmes, we would recommend that another I
su.h pier be built at about the foot of Harri- !
son or Bryant street, this letter serving as
a protection to neighboring piers from the
damaging effects of southeasterly storms.
Fundsâ As to the funds needed for the im
provement of the water front, we are informed
by the Honorable Hoard of State Harbor '-..m
--misFioners that after making the reduction
mentioned of say $2500 per month In expendi
tures they estimate that about $115. 000 per year
will be available for new structures after pay
ing all expenses and keeping the wharves al
ready built in repair. According to estimates
made this would build two wharves of the best
character complete, such ns piers 7 and 12. !
Whin such structures as those are built the
large expense needed at present in repairs
would be reduced to a minimum, and conse
quently a considerably increased sum made
available for new work. As it is evident that
even this saving will not l>e sufficient to carry
on the work of making new structures as fast
as we think desirable we suggest as a menns
Of furnishing the necessary funds for this pur
pose that the I/egislature of the State at the
next session be requested to provide for the
issue -if bonds of Jl.flOo.oon, the money to be
used In extending the seawall southerly and
building new wharves. We would also suggest
t -i your honorable body the advisability of tak
ing steps to change the present custom of draw
ing charter parties In which l n o tons is made
the minimum of freight to be discharged per
weather working day, and that it he made MM
tons, this being necessitated by the greatly in
creased size of modern vessels, the majority of
deep-water shlpa coming here being of 2000
registered tonnage or over, with a dead weight
capacity of from 8000 to 4000 tons or more.
A MASTER OF

Colored People Want
an Academy.
A CALIFORNIAN PROPOSITION
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING AT
ZION A. M. E. CHURCH.
Idea Conceived by David Lubin, Who
Will Visit Eastern Cities to
Urge the Cause of the
Negro.
Last night Initial steps were taken by
representative colored citizens of San
Francisco toward securing for their race
a National Academy of Music to be lo
cated at Washington, D. <'Â or near the
center of the negro population of Amer
ica. A mooting was held at the Starr
King African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church, at which a committee was ap
pointed to map out the plans of procedure
and entrust them to a prominent Sacra
mento and San Francisco business man,
who will visit the East and promulgate
the idea there.
To <'allfornla belongs the credit of the
origin of the movement. David Lubln of
the firm of Weinstocb & Lubin conceived
the thought of the betterment of the so
cial condition of tne black man and men
tioned it to prominent colored citizens.
The enthusiastic, well-attended meeting
last night was the result.
The gathering was presided over by
Rev. E. T. Cot t man. Mr. Luhin was in
troduced and delivered the principal ad
dress of the evening. He stated that a
ran- to secure recognition must lind its
leader whom the world will hear of and
speak of. That leader must have fame,
and fame In music more Quickly touches
the heart strings of the world than does
renown in any other calling.
"Get full of fire and zeal in this city."
said the speaker, "and spread your idf-as
to other cities and get them to lndorsi
and assist in the movement. Then you
will receive aid at every hand. All the
lending Christian associations in the land
will put a shoulder to the wheel and see
the project through. You will enlist the
sympathies of wealthy and influentiol
people, who will he happy to aid the black
man in rising to the plane of his more
favnrod white brother.
"When your cause has beon heard
through the land roar a temple for the
education of a master musician. Let him
be renowned, his music will bo hoard an
over the world and praises be sung to his
name. Then will the colored race come
to bo recognized as a factor in civilization
and its nobility established. The history
of your race did not begin at the time of
Its emancipation, ami it will not begin
until something of this sort is established
and bears fruit.
"I conceived the idea in 1 So.'s . when the
question was put to mo, 'How can the
colored raco bo bettered?' It was a hard
question to answer, but I find Its solution
in the proposition we are here to discuss
to-night."
After tho speaker had concluded a paper
which was in part as follows was read:
There was a time when our sensibilities were
dormant, buried in the Inmost recesses of our
hearts, due to the condition beyond our con
trol. With freedom our sensibilities awoke and
the awakening generated a feeling of pain, in
tense and penetrating, almost as unbearable as
that .>f past indignities. But the freedom we
possess is like a borrowed favor, and the cred
itors ure clamoring at our doors, exclaiming, j
"Where is our return?"
The time has now arrived when an at- '
tempt must be made in the direction of
the higher evolution of our race, and the
purpose of this attempt should be stead
fast in the ratio of our ambition.
The sphere of our action in the domain
is limitless, and in order for Its bettor
accomplishment a limit should be set
for a beginning, and that beginning
should harmonize most closely with our
present natural aptitudes, and there is
no other sphere in which our development
in its initial stage is as likely to bring
about concrete results than through the
avenue of music
Let there bo a concentrated action on j
tho part of the colored race of this na- |
tion to establish in the city of Washing
ton a national academy of music. Let
, other organizations bo effected through
out the length and breadth of our land for
this purpose. Let our people be taught
to contribute and to work for this Insti
tution. Let us ask aid and co-operation
I of all throughout the land who may be
' kindly disposed to aid us in our upward
; struggle. And if this work is rightly di
rected we may expect to see it realized.
i and when that shall have beeji done a
: nudous will have been established, whence
â  we can hopefully expect would arise mas
; tors in music, whoso genius would shod a
1 luster of glory over our race forever, and
i thereby repay a portion of the debt to
I civilization. Achievements in one direc
i tion would encourage attempts in other
' spheres nnd this uplifting tendency would
continue without end.
Rev. W. B. Anderson moved that the
mov.ment be indorsed in the following
words:
Mr. Chairman: I move that the proposition
j as set forth in the paper Just read be approved
: by this assembly as a matter of vital import
! anee t > the colored race. And 1 further move
tlmt in view of its imnortanee that a com
mittee of nine be appointed by the chair for the
i purpose of organizing in this section in the tn
! terest of this proposition, and for the further
purpose of corresponding with the various sec
tions of the United States, all to the end that
proper organization be effected to further the
object in view and for the purpose of materlal
i I zing the proposition set forth.
A number of prominent colored people,
then expressed their sentiments, among
whom were Mrs. Pauline Brown, J. Lin
coln Derrick and Rev. J. EL Kelley. Mrs.
Brown said:
I am glad that this idea is a Callfornlan one.
an.l that the people of this State seem willing
' to help us. It is all so direct and blessed, much
In contrp.st to the treatment our race has re
-1 celved In other sections of. the country. I
j heart il>- endorse the movement. It will be of
the greatest benefit to our race.
The following committee was appointed
by the chair: Rev. E. T. Cottrnan, Rev.
W. R. Anderson. Row J. H. Kelley, Rev.
J. L. Allen. Rev. T. Brown, Mrs. Pauline
Brown, John Derrick. J. S. Francis and
Mrs. Anna Hughes.
David Lubin was named as representa
tive to go Bast, with full power to carry
out the purposes of the. meeting.

McNab Consults the New Executive

Programme.
It has Gained on the local Democracy '
that Gavin McNab has captured "the I

and that he is new a full-fledged boss,
working with his coat off in the basement. |
Mr. McNab' b primary campaign pro
gramme will be officially announced This
week, and it will further interest the
Democratic party.
The meeting of the Committee of One j
Hundred last week showed how well Mr. i
McNab had gathered the strings In Hs
own hand, and it also showed the lorgo I
extent to which a hostile newspaper was j
unable to dictate even to :his portion cf |
the party. The paper made strenuous ef- j
forts to secure the appointment and elec
tion or; convention delegates by precincts,
but McNab saw that district bosses would i
be weakened and that In so far ns the j
McNab coterie might win districts i^eir
party control would be strengthened. The |
journal's scheme was turned down f>r ;
McNab's. Then the paper demanded the
enlargement of the Committee of One |
Hundred, which McNab opposed as d;ui
gerous, and the committee was not en
larged. Then McNab's plan of ;<n ex?c-
Utive commltttee to which the whole com- i
rr.ittee should intrust the primary eani
paJpn was adopted. McNab s â¢ tntrol was
fully evidenced when Chairman M. Jas
per McDonald announced the following
executive committee:

the efforts to perpetuate through the prl- '
mary the party control of the element i
that' gained it with a trick club.
yesterday efforts were begun to find
permanent downtown headquarters, which j
will be at once opened. The executive
committee will meet there Boon, probably
next Thursday evening, to adopt the mas
terly programme to which Boss McNab !
Is giving the finishing touches. The ex
ecutive committee is ostensibly to "stir
tip interest in the primary," for that is
the best bluff that can be found to excuse
the activity of the executive committee
at a time "when, under th* primary law.
the central organization has nothing
further to do if merely a fair field for the
district tickets and the whole party were
consideretd. In theory the party voters
of each district arrange their own tickets
and "tight it out" themselves on election
day, and the county committee lets them
alone in the scrap. But now the McNab
element of the One Hundred element has
"the works." and turns the county com
mittee into a machine to promote the in
terests of one faction at the polls. It is
all right and all natural, perhaps, for the j
county committee to be used as a fac
tional power: It is -imply an interesting
fact that shows at last how the primary
game Is to he made up,
Each executive eommitteeman becomes
a district boss with the power of the cen
tral machine behind him. Each will dom
inate the McNab club of his district, as
some are doing with clubs already organ
ized. The eommitteeman, with the Mc-
Nab sanction, will virtually dictate the
nomination of the McNab ticket of his
district. This will be dubbed the "regu
lar" ticket, that represents "the decent

"Buckley:" will begin, for the main issue
will be McNah vs. Buckley.
A brilliant feature of this campaign
plan has been arranged and will pron
ably be put through at the first meeting
of the executive committee. There is to
be a campaign committee appointed in
each district composed of fine from each
precinct. The district executive eommit
teeman will manage the creation of the
campaign commute.' arid control it. Then
these district campaign committees will
probably be combined into one general
campaign committee that may meet once
on parade if the programme is perfectly
safe.
There is thus in process <if creation a
big, compact organization dominated by
a small element in the Committee of One
Hundred, and through this organization
McNab and his friends hope to control
the nomination of convention delegates,
the campaign committees will afford a
cheap way of giving "recognition" to lâ â¢
--merits which need to be harmonized, and
it will also be a cheap way of making
members.
The hostility to these forthcoming Com
mittee of Â«>ne Hundred tickets will i>^
fWce. especially in the strong Democratic
Qiirtricts to which no recognition has been
given by this coterie. As the honorable
and eloquent Thomas Eagan declared hist
nisrht at a large meeting of the Buckley
Democratic Club of the Twenty-ninth
District: "By subterranean methods they
have throttled the Democratic party ani
trailed it In the dust. Upon the glorious
Democratic banner they have "::st the
mud of defeat instead of the tire of vic
tory."
rrom now on the local Democratic pri
mary campaign will become more definite
and will rapidly assume its natural fierce
ness. Ft will be sport for the gods before

HAVEMEYER ON TRUSTS.
AS the habit of those who oppose tariffs and other
devices to bring artifice to the aid of man is to
accuse of selfishness all who differ with them
they cannot complain at a retort in kind. The free
trade press of the country has been much refreshed
and reassured by .Mr. Havemeyer's testimony before
the Senate commission in relation to trusts and the ef
fect of a protective tariff upon their formation and
])erpetuation.
% Mr. Havemeyer is a Democrat of the most straitest
sect Long before he organized the sugar trust, in
deed, before he was born, his family were merchants
and importers in New York, and for generations fos
tered the importers' aversion to a tariff. Their feel
ing of self-interest made them Democrats and free
traders. The present head of the house is like his for
bears, a free-trader, and a believer in the employment
of foreign labor to produce for the home market.
In view of the high tariff on sugar one would expect
him to see his own interests and to support protec
tion. But he is influenced by his interests. He owns
great sugar estates in Cuba and smarts under the de
nial of free entry t<> raw sugar. The Democratic doc
trine of free raw material and protection to the manu
factured article fits his case exactly. He can produce
raw sugar by cheap labor on his Cuban plantations
and if it have free access to American ports he can
realize more profit than out of the present sugar dif
ferential rate of the Dingley tariff.
Desiring to secure these benefits he denounced the
tariff as the father of trusts. If his position shall help
the free-traders back to power the cry of free raw
material will be heard in the land again and the Cuban
plantations will be worked for all they can produce.
Mr. Havemeyer will hardly deny this description of
his interest in the tariff issue. He is also perfectly
v. ell aware that the tariff has been an impotent factor,
if a factor at all, in the maintenance of the sugar trust.
He knows that the trust flourished under the Wilson
tariff, which admitted raw sugar free and abolished
the bounty upon domestic sugar. He knows, too,
that other great trusts are independent of the tariff.
The Standard Oil trust has flourished under all ad
ministrations. This country is the greatest petroleum
producer in the world. We have oil to export and its
quality is so high and its price so low that no one
cares to enter the held with us. It is a fact in
economics that a tariff on an article which is pro
duced in surplus and is compelled to hunt a market
abroad is absolutely without effect. Petroleum might
as well be left out of the tariff schedules, For its con
siderable importation is impossible. The whisky
trust, one of the seniors of the trust family, older than
Standard Oil or sugar, is another illustration. It
controls not only beverage whiskies, but the high
wine and alcohol product. The United States is the
greatest producer of grain alcohol in the world. Our
corn, rye and wheat aid od the world. We
export it to Europe, Asia and Africa. The fruit and
potato alcohols produced abroad are rivals scarcely
felt in the world's markets. The invention of smoke
less powder has given a great impulse to the alcohol
trade, and Japan. China and Russia are drawing on
us for high wines to be used in that manufacture.
Within the last year a fleet of ships has taken alcohol
u.!i_ r <!ts from S- ; .n Francisco to Yokohama and Vladi
â¢ k and to Chinese ports. The export of alcohol
from Atlantic port-, to be used for the same pur
:, has been still larger. As the articles covered by
the whisky tru-t are produced in groat surplus for ex
port it is certain that that combination I y un
affected by the tariff.
A close examination of Mr. Havcmeyer's remarks
discloses a singular inconsistency, for he tir^t declared
that the sugar trust was born of the tariff and closed
by complaining that the refined sugar had practically
no protection at all.
It is quite evident that Mr. Havemeyer knows more
about the refinement of sugar than the refinements of
economic discussion.
STATE ELECTIONS THIS FALL.
WHILE the Democrats are struggling hard to
rind material for a national platform and an
issue on which to challenge the administration,
the time is rapidly approaching when in several States
they will have to take the field for the elections of the
fall. Their bewilderment and confusion increase as
the dates for opening the campaigns_ draw nearer, and
it is now evident that in every case they will make
such a contest as they can on lfjcal i^ues only, leaving
national affairs to be dealt with as time and chance
may determine next year.
In ?ix States â lowa, Kentucky. Maryland, Massa
: chusetts, Mississippi and Ohio â Governors are to be
elected. Pennsylvania will elect a State Treasurer
and two Justices of the Supreme Court. Legisla
tures are to be elected in several States, but the con
tests are not interesting to the general public except in
New York and Virginia. The latter State is, of
course, sure to be carried by the Democrats, but as
the question is to be raided in nominating conven
tions whether Virginia Democracy favors a choice of
United States Senators by direct vote of the people,
the result will be watched with considerable attention
I by all who are interested in the movement to that end.
It is said to be the intention of the Democratic
leaders in New York to poll as large a vote as pos
sible this fall, for the purpose of recovering the pres
tige of the State in Democratic National Conventions,
which was lost in 1806. It is the belief of Tammany
that if it can carry the State this year it will be better
able to beat Bryan next year. For that reason the
New York contest is expected to be more than ordi
narily vigorous for an off year. It will be fought,
however, solely on State issues if the Democrats have
their way. for neither faction of the party has any de
' sire to take a definite position on any national ques
tion whatever.
The contest in Maryland will be marked on the
Democratic side mainly by a determination to recover
control of the State for the purpose of reviving the
political fortunes of Gorman and putting him in a
j favorable position from which to aspire to the nomi
i nation to the Presidency next year. The recent elec
j tion in Baltimore has given the Gorman stalwarts rea
j son for hoping to carry the State, and accordingly
they will make the fight not only with ardor, but with
; strong expectations of success, and as there is some
j dissatisfaction in the Republican camp, it will not be
I surprising if Maryland returns this fall to the Demo
cratic fold and Gorman emerges from his enforced re
; tirement to assume again the role of a Democratic
j leader.
In Ohio the Republicans have already held their
State convention and put a strong ticket in the field.
! The old factions in the party continue to exist, but the
j antagonism between them is less keen this year than
jit has been for some time past. No evidence of bit
| terness has been disclosed anywhere except in Cleve
land, so that all prospects point to a sweeping Repub
lican victory no matter what ticket the Democrats put
up. or upon what issues they choose to make their
attack.
In scarcely any State will there be much in the way
of national politics involved in the campaign. There
will be, of course, more or less t.tlk of free silver, but
lit will not be fervent nor much heeded. It is going to

be an oft year in the fullest sense of the phrase so
fai as larger questions are concerned, and State poli
tics will have a clear field in almost every voting dis
trict where an election takes place.
THE SITUATION IN THE TRANSVAAL
LATE. reports from the Transvaal encourage the
hope that, despite the fiasco of the conference at
Bloemfontein. the crisis in the contest between
the claims of the Outlanders and the stubbornness of
the Boers may pass without an appeal to arms. The
Eritish clearly have everything to gain by pursuing a
waiting policy for a time at least, and the Boers can
hardly hope to derive profit from a war.
The controversy presents one of the most intricate
problems of conflicting rights that can be imagined.
It has been said that every legal right is on the side
of the Boers, but every moral right on the side of the
Outlanders; and the statement sums up the situation
about as accurately as can be done in a single ?en-
tence.
The Boers went into the Transvaal, drove out the
barbarian natives and took possession of the territory
by the right of a higher civilization' Where savagery
had been, they established law. an extensive pastoral
j industry and something of agriculture, with such
; primitive manufacturing as is necessary to supply the
limited needs of that sort of a community. They hold
their country, therefore, by the double title of con
quest and cultivation, and being a brave as well as a
stubborn race are not afraid to defend it.
The Outlanders went into the territory and found
that its rich mineral resources were not developed and
no adequate means of communication with the outer
world had been provided. They set about opening
mines, constructing railways, erecting factories and
founding cities. Having accomplished much in the
way of adding to the wealth of the Transvaal and in
creasing the value of the property of the Boers, and
finding themselves heavily taxed, they demand the
franchise and admission t% a participation in the
government. The Boers reject the demand on the
ground that if granted the Outlanders would out
vote the natives, take possession of the country and
annex it to British South Africa.
The issue arising out of such conflicting claims is
not one that can be determined offhand. The Out
hmders have as much right to enforce a higher civili
an on the Boers as tie Boers had to enforce their
civilization on the African. Moreover, the class of
citizens in any community that pays the larger por
tion of taxes ought to have some voice in the levying
c f taxes and in their expenditure. Against all such
claims on the part of the Outlanders, however, there
stands the unquestioned right of the Boers to defend
themselves from conquest by immigration as well as
from conquest by arms; and it is certain if the Out
landers lire given a share in the government, they will
eventually take possession of it altogether.
The present crisis arises from the fact that th* Out
landers have become impatient and have petitioned
i the British Government to compel the Transvaal Gov
i ernment to grant redress for their wrongs. Thus a
question has been raised as to the extent of the Brit
i-h right of interference in the affairs of the republic
ana that is a question that never fails to rouse the
wrath of the Boers to the utmost height.
A little imprudence on the part of either Govern
ment would at this time precipitate a war, but for
; tunately late dispatches give assurance that no im
prudent act is likely to be committed. The British
authorities are aware their strength in the Trans
vaal is increasing every day and they have nothing to
gain by hasty action, while President Kruger must
i be equally aware that he cannot stem the advancing
' tide of South African development by war at this.time.
Both Governments are. therefore, inclined to peace,
and each is strong enough to hold its people back
from an armed conflict.
THE CULTIVATION OF VACANT LOTS.
A/N association in Philadelphia has been follow
ing for two years the example set by Detroit of
providing gardens for the poor, out of the va
cant lots of the city; and while the experiments have
not been very extensive, considering the size of
Philadelphia, the results have been highly gratifying.
A summary given by the Philadelphia Record of
the second annual report of the association says that
last year sufficient land for 162 quarter-acre gardens
was secured and given for cultivation to 140 poor
families, numbering 770 persons. Although the sea
son was not a favorable one for gardening, as a result
of operations there was an average yield per garden of
$60. The total outlay of the association for superin
tendence, seed, tools and incidental expenses was
$2266. The total value of the product of the gardens
was $9700. Each dollar spent by the association in
helping its beneficiaries to help themselves was thus
turned into four and a quarter dollars in their hands.
As was to have been expected, the gardens were
not cultivated with equal industry or skill, and as
a consequence the results were far from being equal.
Fifteen of the gardens yielded an average of $100
each, while a considerable number averaged a yield
of only $24 each. The association justly claims that
the lowest yield is better than the weeds which would
otherwise have grown on the lots. The old principle
that half a loaf is better than no bread applies in this
as in other efforts to better the conditions of city
life; and moreover, a charitable investment that re
turn? upward of three hundred per cent profit after
supplying the needs of many families and giving em
ployment to persons who would otherwise have been
idle and exposed to the temptations of idleness^ may
certainly be accounted a bright success.
The association is so pleased with its work that it
has undertaken it on a larger scale this year. The
superintendent estimates there are a thousand fami
lies in Philadelphia in need of help who would gladly
avail themselves of such gardens if offered. It is4lie
hope of the association to evntually gratify the full
demand. The question of vacant-lot gardening there
fore may be considered as settled favorably, so far
?.s Philadelphia is concerned.
It is to be noted that the work in that city has been
undertaken and is managed by a private association,
and not by politicians or municipal officials. Perhaps
that may have had much to do with the excellent busi
ress methods of administration and the good results
obtained.

IS HE READY TO RESIGN?

In "Down the Line" column of the

says:
"All this talk printed of late about the

not -without some foundation. I do not
dream for a moment that he will resign,
but I know that he would like to, beyond
question. Any number of times has he

would be glad to get out of ii all if he I
could. But he is not the man to take his |
hand off the plow handles until the end !
of the furrow is reached, and he is just j
irascible and obstinate enough if, at the i
end of his term, his enemies attempt to I
take the position that he must get out of I
the field, to go in and be re-elected or |
run for the Senate, or something of the I
like. It is safe to say that he is not par
ticularly happy as Governor, but he will \
stick to the game till the last card is

posed of depositions lately arrived from
the East were opened at the request of
the defendant's attorneys. The first was
that of Charles H. Rockwell of Beaufort,
S. C. He deposed that he had seen Mrs.
Lung at Port Royal. S. C, on several oc
casions. and although she acted strangely
he could not swear that she was intoxi
cated. "She was always vivacious," he ,
said. "She might have been angry, but i
I can't swear that she was under the in
fluence of liquor."
John Surman of the United States Ma
rine Corps at Port Royal testified that
Mrs. Lung came to his house on several
occasions in a state of unquestionable in
ition. Finally the witness implored
Dr. Lung to keep Mrs. Lung away from
his home, as he did not believe her to be
a tit associate for his wife. Mrs. Lung
heard that Surman told her husband of
her intoxication and she approached the
witness and asked him how much
owed him. He said 90 cents. She drew
it from her pocket and, thrusting it into
his hand, said: "There, you dirty marine,
I don't owe you anything now, and you
may depend "upon it I will make things
warm for you." In conclusion the witness
said that he saw Mrs. Lung drunk five |
times in six weeks and while in this con- i
dition she cared nothing for her actions, !
reaching the lowest depths of abandon.
Patrick Wall testified to the same facts
and rt new line was brought out in the ;
deposition of W. A. Mackenzie of Scroon
L:ik-- N. Y. He said that he saw the I
c at Beaufort. S. C. his attention |
being called to them by the intoxication
and profane language of the lady. He
afterward saw them in the train, and j
without warning Mrs. Lung assaulted her
husband, slapped his face, pulled his hair,
dug her nails in his cheeks and wound
up by throwing a bunch of wet flowers in j
his face. Through it all Dr. Lung sat in
deep humiliation, but never raised his j
hand toward the woman. Finally he was !
forced to call upon the witness for pro
tection, and Mackenzie promptly quiet* d
her by threatening her with arrest. An
other batch of depositions will be opened
in a few days.

Victims Want Damages.
Isaac T. Hintnn filed suit yesterday
against the Market Street Railway Com
pany to recover 522,000 damages for per
sona] Injuries sustained June 19. 1597, at
Kearny and Market streets. Harvey S.
Malone also asks damages in the sum of
$15,000. The plaintiff allots that on April
10 last he was taken with an epileptic
fit on an Ellis street car. While in that
condition, the car having reached How
ard and Kniirth streets, the motnrman
ordered him off the car. He was unable
to respond and the conductor and grip
man deliberately threw him off. head
foremost. He was severely Iniured in
consequence, and hence asks for $15,000
damages for the brutal act of which he
was the victim.
A STRAIGHT TIP.
A few days ago The Call announced
with much positiveness that Governor
Gage will call an extra session of the
Legislature. The Governor made a mild
denial, but it is a noteworthy fact that
his partisans have since been industrious
ly educating public sentiment up to the
belief that an extra session Is actually
necessary. All the circumstances indicate
that The Call had a straight tip.-Wood
land Democrat.
EXTRA SESSION GOSSIP,
Tn view of the amount of gossip con
cerning an extra session, The Â»'all lias
figured up the probable cost It finds
that a session of thirty days would coat
$129,000, sixty days (250,000, and ninety
days $379,000.
No one can tell how long the session
might last and consequently what it
would cost; but one thing may be con
sidered certainâ any good it would accom
plish would not begin to pay for thi â¢ X
pense. In fact, the session would do more
harm than good, aside from any qvi.
of expense. The people will hope that
Governor Gage will stick to his announced
determination not to call any extra ses

MRS. CROWLEY IS
TO KEEP HER CHILD
JUDGE DAINGERFIELD RENDERS
A DECISION.
The Father's Offer to Support His
Baby in a Convent Is Not Con
sidered by the Court.
The contest between J. George Crowley,
bookkeeper of the Union Ice Company,
and his former wife, Mrs. Mattie Crow
ley, for the custody of their five-year-old
daughter was concluded before Judge
Daingerfield yesterday morning. Mrs.
Crowley was granted the custody of the
child until the further order of the court.
The parties to the action were prolific
in their charges against each other, and
nad the court taken either side seriously
it is certain that a third person would
have had the care of the child for some
time to come. After counsel and litigants
had concluded their battle Judge Dainger
field decided the case. He said that he
believed that the child was practically an
infant, although aged 5 y< sug
gested, the court held that ed the
t-hilu s grandmother to be a proper p
to have her rare and custody, but
murh as Mrs. Crowley was her n
and miirht through ncr baby's Influence
lead a more quiet life, and since thf- little
one could not be aware of thf matters
presented to the court, he would not
c Â»ange the decree and hence allowed the
child to remain with her mother Mr
Crowley offered to pay $20 a month for the
care and maintenance of the child in
either a convent or a seminary, but the
court refused to Interfere

SPLENDID GIFT
TO OLYMPICS
Cancels Five Thou
sand in Bonds.
PART OF BIG DEBT ERASED
SOME OTHER BONDHOLDERS
EXPECTED TO FOLLOW.
Directors of the Olympic Club Are
Grateful and Will Show Their
Appreciation to the
Donor.
The board of directors of the Olympic
Club were presented on Saturday with
$5000 of their own bonds. Mrs. Jane Stan
ford was the donor and her cancellation
of the debt due her by the club was a
surprise which the directory will long re
member.
When the present club building was
erected bonds were issued as security to
the subscribers of stock. Since the issu
j ance the bonded indebtedness has re
mained at the same figure which it as
sumed originally. A fair rate of interest
was paid the holders for many years, but
the financial condition of the club was
such that little hope existed for the can
-1 collation of the bonded indebtedness. The
subscribers were chiefly the big capital
! ists of San Francisco, and they put their
! money into the club not as an Investment
â  but rather to serve some public municipal
; end. James G. Fair and others of the
big mining contingent subscribed freely.
; The st'iek was never put upon the market
1 and has no marketable value. Should the
I bondholders determine to press the club
for the payment of the money which has
long become due it would of necessity
force the Olympic Club out of existence.
At the beginning of this year the di
â¢ rectors decided not to pay interest on a
great portion of the bonded debt. The
rity of the holders gave an acqui
re to this action of the board. There
I were some, however, who objected stren-
I uously to this sacrifice of their rights.
i.The matter was finally adjusted without
j the necessity of the payment of the ml
l terest.
The generosity of Mrs. Stanford in the
'â  cancellation of the $5000 of the club bond,s
: has been the occasion of many encomiums
I on the part of the club's board of direct
ors. This is the first big cancellation of
i Olympic bonds since their issuance ten
! years ago. While the bonds were prac-
I tically valuelessâ for no holder cared to
'< force a sale of the club propertyâ the
board of directors feels deep obligations
|to th( Ity of Mrs. Stanford. It is
ted that many other large bond
-1 holders will follow the course set by her.
Should the Olympic Club be freed from
this heavy ineumbrance by such means
it will be on a strong financial basis
. again.

OSCAR POWELL, a Boy 11 Years of Age, Arrested
on a Charge of Assault With a Deadly
OSCAR POWELL, a boy 11 years of age. is possibly the youngest crimi
nal hooked at the City Prison on the serious charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. He was arrested by Policeman Galloway yesterday
afternoon and did not at all realize the seriousness of the Vriine
charged against him. He is a bright boy. and the prison officials wei so
struck by his appearance that they placed him in charge of the matron in
stead of locking nim up in a cell with other boys charged with crimes.
Oscar lives at 272 liarriet street and was presented by his parents with
a parlor rifle, 22 caliber. Yesterday morning he went into the hack >ard,
and seeing a knothole in the fence thought he would fire at it and see how
many bullets he could put through it. When he tired the first shot there
was a yell from the adjoining yard and he decided to stop further firing.
Investigation led to the discovery that the bullet had not gone through the
knothole, but had pierced th,- fence board close to n and had struck Elmer
McNulty, a boy seven years of age, who was in the adjoining yard, on the
shin bone, shattering it.
When McNulty's father got home to lunch at noon and learned of the
â  T-.t to his boy, he hurried to the Southern Police Station and insisted

wagon was sent to the residence of Oscar's parents and he was taken to

THE DOCTORS' BAD GUESS.
Mrs. Mary Jane Doolin Was Not Af
flicted With a Tumor.
In November. 1891, Mrs. Mary Jane Dun
lin, wife of Michael Joseph Doolin, was
riding in on<= of the old Omnibus Cable
Company's horse cars, when the horses
j ran away and carried the vehicle over a
bank. The passenger was injured, and.
i according to the complaint filed in an
ai tion for damages against the company
; two years later, she was a physical wreck
and mentally impaired on account of the
accident. When the case was on hearing
jin September, lsM. three physicians . > f
' standing in this city testified that they
j had examined the sufferer and found that
I she was afflicted with a huge tumor,
; which they believed was caused or ag
gravated by the accident. The plaintiff
was awarded 120,000 by a sympathetic
jury.
The money was paid over, hut a few
' months later the street car company Went
i Into court and asked for a new trial ol
' the case on the ground of the damages
! being excessive and that newly discov
ered evidence had been found which
would have a material bearing upon the
case. The newly discovered evidence con
sisted of a baby that the woman had
I given birth to a few weeks after obtain
! ing the damages. When the Judge of t hi
j lower court found that a baby and not
a tumor cut an Important figure in the
case, he ordered the Doolins to refund
115,000, or a new trial would he granted.
They refused to give up any of the cash,
and a retrial of the entire matter wa?
! ordered, from which order they appealed.
The Supreme Court thought that there
were enough new features In the case to
I warrant the upholding of the order of the
| lower court.

A warrant was issued yesterday from
Judge C'onlan's court for the arrest of
Henry Free, a saloon keeper at Seventh
avenue and Fulton street, for allowing an
unregistered dog to run at large. Last
Friday the dog attacked John Bornholdt,
a lame boy, and if it had not been for
the timely Interference of a motorman
would have worried him to death.

STREET FRANCHISES.
Supervisors Delay Granting Rights
Asked by the Market Street
Company.
Nothing was done yesterday by the
Board of Supervisors toward final adop
tion of the franchises asked for by the
Market Street Railroad Company. It was
understood that an agreement had been
reached between the company and the
board and that there would be no obj'-e-
tion to the framing of the franchises as
amended to conform to the wishes of the
Merchants' Association and others.
When the resolutions were presented
yesterday Supervisor Byington offered an
amendment that the Market Street Hail
road Company be Forced to use orna
mental iron poles Wherever it was neces
sary to employ the overhead power sys
tem. The amendment was adopted and
then Byinerton moved that either an over
hear] or underground system of wins be
used at the discretion of the hoard. This
resulted In a wide discussion mid the r-'f

Street Committee for consideration

BOHEMIAN CLUB'S
REDWOOD GROVE
A Glimpse of the Forest
THE purchase of the Meeker Grove of redwoods has been effected by the
Bohemian Club. The scheme to buy the grove was submitted to the
members at a special meeting recently and the directors were authorized
to pay the price demanded â $27,500. The issue of sentiment and interest
bearing bonds, with the land and trees as security, was also authorized by the
members of the club.
Before closing the transaction a re-^xnmination of the boundaries was sug
gested, and it was also thought best to have an expert's estimate of the ac
tual commercial value "f the standing timber. The information desired In these
respects whs obtained and all the facts were submitted to the members of the
club. Yesterday final steps were taken to bind the transaction by the first
payment of money.
The Bohemian Club will be highly commended throughout thi country for
the enterprise displayed in preserving at least one of the beautiful groves in
the redwood zone of California. The trees of Meeker' s Grove on the Russian
River are not as lofty and majestic as are the great monarchs of the redwood
forest in Hurnholdt County, but the grove is accessible to S;m Francisco and
easily within the range of tourist observation. Meeker' s drove is but a short
distance from either of two railway lines. Measuring space by time, the for
est reservation of the club is only three hours from the city.
It is assumed that the citizens Of Sonoma County in the region of the re
served grove will appreciate the spirit which prompted the purchase and will
not regard the domain as belonging to speculators. In some quarters of the
West it is not regarded as an unpardonable sin to cut timber on land belong
ing to non-residents.
Among the most earnest and zealous workers on behalf of the enterprise
the president of the club. Vanderlynn Stow, is foremost. His patience, skill
and tact have overcome formidable objections to the scheme. His sincerity
and enthusiasm won him the support of many who were at first Indifferent.
The next midsummer high jinks of the club will be held in Meeker' a Grove
Saturday. July 22. Captain Robert Howe Fletcher has been appointed sire.
DEAD AND FORGOTTEN
FOR THREE WEEKS
LONELY ENDING OF CARPENTER
CARMODY'S LIFE.
Died Suddenly While Preparing to Go
Out for His Usual Evening
Stroll Down Market
Street.
A ghastly discovery was made early
yesterday morning by F. N. Rlaekman,
who resides in the second story of 1723
Market street.
The ground floor was used as a carpen
; ter shop and Bleeping apartment by E. ;
Carmody, a man about 66 years old. The
! shop had not been opened since May 30 or j
31, but Mr. Blackman did not think that
, anything was wrong, for the shop was '
often closed for two or three days at a
| time. But he became aware of an intol- j
I erable odor arising from the rear of the !
, shop yesterday morning, and- he at once i
notilie'd the police. The door was forced ;
1 open, and in a back room the body of
! Carmody was found in an advanced stage
of decomposition. It was fully dressed,
lying back on the bed, with a closed ur
n' brella in the hands, as though the de- ;
ceased had sat on the side of the bed be
fore starting out for a walk. The daily
newspapers to which the deceased had
subscribed, together with letters from the
postofflce addressed to him. were lying
untouched on the floor of the shop. The
oldest newspaper was of the date of May j
i 31 of this year, and it Is likely, in view of
' that fact, that Carmody died on the even
ing of May 30.
An autopsy made by Dr. Zabala yester- I
' day afternoon disclosed valvular .usease
â  of the heart as the cause of death. Car
' mody was unmarried and a native ol Ire
land.
EQUITABLE GAS STOCK.
Directors Deny That the Competing
Company Has Been Absorbed.
T';f report that the Equitable Gaslight '
Company has been absorbed by the San I
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany through a transfer of a large block ,
of stock has created a great deal of inter
eat in local financial circles. The officers
of the Equitable Gaslight Company deny j
emphatically that their company has |
passed under the control of the older ;
corporation or that it ever will be so ab- ,
sorbed. They insist that the new com- '
pany was organized honestly to compete â 
with the old and has carried out its prom- ;
ise to the community.
A majority of the stock of the new com- i
pany is held in a pooling agreement, the I
most important provision of which Is that i
none of the stock so pooled shall be sold ]
to a rival gas corporation or its agents.
The books of the Equitable Gaslight Com
pany show tjiat no stock has been sold I
since early in April, and that only small
blocks were sold to individual buyers for i

many months before that date.
The officers of the new company insist
that persistent rumors intended to injure
them in the eyes of the public have been
circulated by the older corporation, but to
no purpose. The new company now en
joys a substantial patronage, is gradually
enlarging its field of operations and claim's
to be competing so successfully with 'he
older corporations as to make itself
feared. In the new company there are
250,000 shares of stock. Of this number
13 <.500 shares are pooled for five years
under the terms of the agreement indi
cated. The officers of the company de
clare that this stock has not been trans
ferred, and even if it were it could be of
no value to a rival company in an effort
to secure control. Of the remaining stock
79.500 shares are still in the treasury and
33.000 shares are held hv individuals. "if all
but the stock which has been pooled were
purchased by a rival corporation the new
company would still retain its own policy
HOME FOR WORKING GIRLS.
Dr. Wilson Makes an Appeal for Its
Support.
An urgent appeal is made by Rev. J.
A. B. Wilson on behalf of the Co-opera
tive Home for self-supporting small sal
aried women at 645 Folsom street. The
home is a new institution and was
founded by Dr. Wilson of the Howard
street M. E. Church last January. It is
the second of its kind in the United
States, the first having been founded by
Dr. Wilson in New York City .some years
ago.
Dr. Wilson's object was to provide a
haven for self-respecting women who. be
cause of meager compensation, find it im
possible to secure agreeable and proper
boarding houses.
The home in this city, which is called
the Co-operative No. 2. is under the ac
tive direction of Mrs. Mary Mackjey and
has been found to work admirably. The
conditions under which young women are
taken into the institution have made it
necessary to appeal for funds to carry
Otl the worthy project. Ine inmates pay
|2.i0 a week if they are able, and some
less. They receive good food and there
is little left after t!ie rent ($27 50) is paid
Mrs. Mackley states that the home is
overcrowded. Girls who need its shelter
are every day refused admission for lack
of room. The house contains but ten
apartments and there are twenty-one oc
cupant:;. It has been found necessary to
place cots in the Kitchen and dining room
to accommodate them. Another and
much more commodious house is needed,
and I'r. Wilson would nKe to see chari
tably Inclined people make the extension
of the good work possible, fie says that
with three months' rent and furniture
for a building he can make the place self
supporting. His idea is to take care of
100 young girls. They are subject to no
rules or regulations, except that they
should conform themselves to the com
mon laws of propriety.
The idea is to give the inmates a two
years" course in household work and the
project is in every way worthy of the
substantial support of charitable people.
Star of the Sea Picnic.
Elaborate preparations have been
raade by the parishioners of Star of the
Sea Church for their outing, which is to
be held to-morrow at Shell Mound Park.
Father Coyle has worker! hard to makÂ«
the programme of entertainment |
ing, and ho has been assisted by willing
helpers in his parish. Yesterday he an
nouncer! that every arrangement had
been completed, and that nothing but a
downpour of rain, which is not likely to
occur, would prevent the picnic being a
grand success. A larpp number of tickets
have been uispnsfd of and it is believed
that the attendance will exceed first ex
pectations.

sumption that a dividend was to be declared, j
Federal Steel and other stocks of companies in !
the steel trade dropped in sympathy. A buy- j
ing demand for Tf-nnessee Coal, which spread j
to Colorado Fuel, had a larjr- influence in j
checking the decline in the whojo group and
effecting the partial recovery, except in Fed
eral Steel, which sold at the lowest on the last i
call. The temporary strength displayed by j
Sugar also served as a sustaininc influence, j
The early drop in the whrat market stiffened ''
the Grancers for a while, but they yielded
acfiin. It is evident that the public and opera
tors in stock? are waiting for the future course
of events in the country's business and Indus- i
try to become more clearly defined. Although |
the buying demand Is at a standstill, present !
holders show no disposition to sell at present I
prices. The market is a waiting one.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 â¢ :. â  â  â  - '' I
i CHICAGO, June 19.â confidence of |
j wheat traders who have been buying on the j
I belief that the Prussian crop had been ruined
by drouth- was staggered at the opening by i
1 cables reporting good rains in some parts of j
j the drouth-stricken districts and by a break :
i of l^d at Liverpool. The news took a cent off. i
j the price of wheat the curb and the open- ;
j lr.g quotations of the regular session showed j
even more decline, September starting at '
[ 77 5 >'5 77 i Â«c. compared with yesterday's closing ,
1 price of -.-. A brief recovery to 7*c took j
i place under buying by scalpers and moderate :
; covering by shorts, but the decidedly bearish [
; tone of domestic news soun checked buying! '
â  One of the most important factors was the !
! enormous receipts at primary Western points, ;
1,022.000 bushels, against 103,000 the corre
spending date of 1898. The weather through- !
out the West and Northwest was reported tav- I
i orable. Private ad\ iÂ«'es from Russia said the
; reporte rains came u>o late for any materiHl ;
â  benefit to the crop. The visible supply showed !
i an increase of but 326.'' l Â«Â«'> bushel . a third of â¢
'â â  what had been expected. The huge primary re- ;
: ceipts kept the market weak until in the after- ,
', noon, when reports of hct winds in Kansas '
i and Nebraska caused some apprehension, on i
! which September rallied to 7MÂ»c and closed at \
j that point.
Corn as a whole was dull. The market I
1 opened weak with wheat, but prices Boon re- i
i covered and the market ruled steady to the 1
j close. September left off unchanged. :
; oats were Irregular, firm for July, but weak j
! ar.d lower for September. July was influenced j
I by moderate stocks and the good cash demand j
; and closed 'Â«â â  higher. September closed 'V' ;
; lower.
Provisions, though dull with the exception of
i a few minutes around the opening, were j
! steady later, but lower hog prices had some ;
! effect. There was buying early by packers, and j
1 later in the day local shorts covered moderate- â 
I ly. Prices advanced all around, September j
: closing 10c higher, lard a shade higher and ribs 1
; 5c higher.

Â«i- thoroughly overhauled and put in condition
I for an active campaign by the night of the
I Uth and underground work was resumed on
the 15th. The new line of 6-lnch pipe for
carrying compressed air has been connected
and placed in position from the compressor to
and through the pump compartment of the
i shaft to t!ir- f,.,wcr station 24 feet abn>> the
1750, and the pipe Is now being laid along the
1750-foot level to the winze from this level to
the !><"". The winze station has been equipped
with everything requirc-d for work, and as Boon
as the pipe line is connected with the engine
work can be started on the ISOO level. The jipe
line hfis been arranged in the shaCt so that
connection can be made from the I'elton wheels
that are in position on the 800, 1000 and 1500
foot levels of the C. and C, shaft where mod
ern compressors run by water power can be
Installed and the compressed air sent through

small force of men until the compressed air
pipe line has been finished. We have extracted
and sent to the surface six cars of ore of a
value of about $15 per ton, and rive cars of ore
ass:. vine $v 77 per ton. This last mentioned ore
cannot now be extracted profitably, but as it
is in our way and lias to be taken out we keep
It separate from our better ore, and it can he
sold for part of the cost of extraction. We
I are now cutting out for regular square sets for
stoping. While elevator No. 1 Is being lifted
to the surface oi the water and overhauled we
hnv ( - allowed the water to raise above the 1950,

OAKLAXI i oaks are doomed, and unless the methods now being adopted
by the Horticultural Commissioner prove effective the next generation
may wonder why this city was given its me.
Commissioner Pryal astonished the Board of Supervisors this morn
ing by including in his otiicial report a reference to the grand old oak trees
that are a part of Oakland.
"It is not generally known." said the Commissioner, "that our grand and
sup.jb o;ik tre.-s are infected with scale pests. Trees that are
Infected with this scale have a blighted, burned, dark foliage, as if
partly scorched. lam now making a thorough inspection of all the oak trees
in Oakland to see how many of them are Infested with this parasitical insect.
1 have placed colonies of Rhlzobius in the infested oaks, and I feel sure they
will prevent ami diminish the further inroads of the destructive pests."
The board was surprised at the information conveyed by Commissioner
Pryal; as there had previously been no intimation that the old oaks were in
danger of being exterminated. It has been noticed during the past five years
that the little clumps of these sturdy trees remaining in the park squares and
o;i the outskirts of the city have been losing much of their brightness and vi
tality, but it was attributed to natural decay. Now it is learned that the
ravage is the result of a well-known pest the Supervisors will at once encour
age all proper means to save the remnants of the rest that once covered the
site of the city.

Last night as Mr?. Black was driving

tempted to snatch her satchel at the same
time. The woman held oh to the lines and
grabbing thi whip started to lash the fel- i
low over the head. A few strokes caused
him to let go, but he still made attempts
to gel Into thi buggy by clambering up
the back. Mrs. Black feels sure that the
man. who was respectably dressed, was
an all around villain, and that robbery
alone was not his motive. He showed
much boldness in his attack, because on
Sunday evening electric cars with the ;
most powerful headlights pass along the

Black had no pistol and nothing to de
fend herself with but her whip. She used
this vigorously and declares that she:

urged the horse ahead and the fellow
hung on to the rear of the buggy for a I

With "> per <â ' ut of tin- total amount ad

hulls of the ftve new ships now on the
slips.
The big battleship Ohio, which will be
tl:>- I .- I r u â¢ s t vessel ever built on this coast,
is stretched along on the berth where
the world renowned Oregon received her
finishing touches and from where the
Wisconsin took her dip into the salt
water a lew months ago. On the slip to
the >;ist of this the monitor Wyoming!
has her framework lying on parallel lines
with the Ohio: this is the berth upon
which tii"' San Francisco and other San
Francisco built men-of-war were created.
Oh the three smaller slips to the east of
this are the Paul Jones. Perry and Pre
ble, which vessels are intended as tor- :
peflo boat destroyers.
Sufficient headway has been made on
the entire lot that LTncle Sam instructed
his agent at the Navy Department in i
Washington to advance to the Scotts 5 1
per cut of the contract price for their i
construction.
As soon as I'ncle Snm had disposed of
this little formality, he at once proceeded
to enter into a contract for diagonal
armor ami a conning tower tube for the

and the Secretary of the Navy must do
the best he can with the manufacturers.,
as Congress had failed to fix a figure
at which tliis armor should tie bought.
It will require about thirty tons for the 1
Ohio, while 533 tons will be required for

PAIL POSE MAY
NOT BE A CRANK
Suspidoi That He Is Training fo^ a
Position on a Yell w Journal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. 908 Broadway. June If.
THE star crank was arrested to-day. He calls himself Paul Pose, and
he was taken into custody by order of Captain Wilson because his an
tics had caused much annoyance to women and children. Pose is un
dc/Ã¼bted'y a genuine crank, but Dr. Todd says he is not crazy enough
to warrant sending him to an asylum. One of his weaknesses is to walk
around town wearing ;i woman's large blue sunbonnet. The excuse for ar
resting him was that he is violating the ordinance prohibiting any ow
from masquerading in the attiro < t the opposite sex. The delicate point
has arisen as to whether the mere wearing of ;i woman's bonnet on the
street can be construed as masquerading in feminine attire. The purpose
of the ordinance is to prevent people from disguising themselves for the
purpose of committing or preventing the detection of crime, and there is
no such suggestion in the case of Pose.
Mr. Pose had in his pockets a hunch of circulars which leave It in doubt
as to whether he he crazy or merely sarcastic. On one card was written:
"I am the king of cranks and have established a universal tru?t company.
Will construct a chicken coop, revolutionize a government and will also or
ganize a bnbe trust. Consultation for 10 cents."
Another prospectus states that lie will organize a "Fault Fining Fra
ternity," which will run a newspaper, of which he must be editor-in-chW.
The first issue is to he devoted to publishing the faults of the people in re
sponse to an offer of a $S(HX) prize for the naming- of the greatest fault.
ThoF,-. who have examined Paul Pose suggest that he is merely graduat
ing for a high position on some yellow journal.
HOW STATELY
FORESTS ARE
BEING RUINED
Must Do Something,
Says Mr. Mills.
HIS TRIP TO PORTLAND
LOSS OF THE TREES AFFECTING
WATER SUPPLIES.
Not Only Is All Sawing Timber Be
ing Taken, but in Taking It
All Other Timber Is
Being Deetroyed.
"We have the grandest State in the
Union an<l we are ruining it," is W. 11.
Mills' idea gathered from a trip through
the northern part of this State and
through Oregon. He h;is been through the
lumber country of both States, and if
there is anything Mr. Mills grows enthu
siastic over it is the forestry of Califor
nia, but he says there is a limit to the
trees and there stems to he no limit to
their destruct lon.
Incidentally Mr. Mills' trip north was to
sell timber land. He went as far as Port
land and there he closed a deal by which
he turned over to lumber men two lota of
land in Oregon. One included 147,000 Acres
nnd the other 105,000 acres. All this will
be cleared within a few years. These
sales, with two made in May aggregating
291,000 acres, make up a respectable total
for two months.
"No one has ;iny idea of the way the
forests are being depleted," said Mr. Mills
yesterday. "Where a few years ago there
were miles On miles of unbroken timber,
now there is nothing but bare hills and
blackened stumps. I saw or;.- place where
there Were five sawmills: they cut v.\< 200
logs a day and they are clearing about 210
acres a week, tn one place where we have
the right to all the timber left by the lum
ber men f found it t<>,>k 4900 acres a year
m supply our engines. The lumbermen
leave absolutely nothing on the la\nd, al
though there Is ;i great deal of timber the
lumbermen cannot use.
"There should be bo timber cut without
tji" supervision of the forest wardens.
They should mark the trees to ho felled
;ind no others should ho taken. As it is
now .-ill the best trees are selected by tho
milliner, and in getting these out they de
stroy not only nil the other old trees, but
the young ones as well. The clearing of
the forests is also affecting the water sup
ply. If they go (in ms they have been go
ing it will not be long before the Sacra
mento River will be nothing hut a small
stream. In these vast extents of *cleared
lands, where when the trees stood you
could not go any distance without eroSS
inp a stream, there is now not even a
spring; the hills are drying up. When the
rain falls it runs off the Si< pcs as it does
off ;h>' ronf of a house, tne streams rise
and run like torrents and then dry up
again as soon as the rain is over. Snow
melts as quickly as it falls, almost, and
tho land drys before spring is past.
"There Is another branch of th<' lumber
trade thai is using millions of feet a year:
it is the box trade. Everything is packed
in boxes how and box mills are running
night and day to supply the demand. Peo
ple do not realize what an amount of lum
ber is used in boxes. Why, last year we
shipped 20,000 carloads of oranges out of
the State-; each car had 300 boxes and each
box was at least two feet of lumber. Now
that makes 6.000,000 boxes and 12,000,000
feet of lumber for the orange crop alone.
After that there are the other fruits
shipp< d in boxeS and then there is all the
merchandise, .wiy one can pet some idea
of that by {joins along the street and
looking at the wholesale houses shipping
and receiving poods.
"You see all this territory being cleared
is "being put to use. mainly through irri
gation. More people are coining in and
more lumber is being used. The tariff is
almost prohibitive and therefore it limits
th<- spun t supply to our own forests,
and we have hot large forests. They arc
big enough so far as acres are concerned,
but they are not big forests when you
come to compare them with the great for
ests of the northern country. Between
here and New Orleans there are no for
ests to speak of and yet we have to sup
ply all the demand.
'"'Something shoiild be done about it. I
have written to every Assessor in the
State to ask for information as to the
number of sawmills in their counties, and
when I have the answers it will surprise
people. There are hundreds of them and
I am afraid to guess at the timber they
cut every day."
Mr Mills has been gone a week. He re
turned yesterday morning. He did not
confine himself to the main line all the
way but took side trips whenever the op
portunity offered. Tie traveled in his pri
vate car. saw everything there was to Vie
seen and heard everything there was to
hear.
SEAL STILL SPORTS.
Big "McKinley" Was Not Shot at b^
Officer Atchison.
The plan was laid for a seal-shooting
exhibition at the Cliff .House yesterday
afternoon, but no shots were fired, and
big burly "McKinley," the father of the
flock, still lives to splash and croak out
a suffering life.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals heard that
"Mac" was stretched out on one of the
Seal Rocks suffering from a gunshot
wound which, as it was supposed, he re
ceived while off on a visit to the Far
allones. Two members of the society,
with Officer Atchison. the crack shot of
the Police Department, went to the Cliff
House yesterday. They had intended to
end the" life of "McKinley" by some fine
rifle shooting. But the proprietor of the
place, J. M. Wilkins. was on the scene and
he refused to nllow any such proceedings.
He demonstrated to the humanitarians
and the police officer that "McKinley"
was a citizen of the Seal-Rock group and
that he was well enough to do almost any
old thing. Furthermore, Wilkins forbade
any popping of firearms on his land. The
three seal-destroyers moved eastward
with an unused rifle and big McKinley
still grunts.
TRACKED BY A WOMAN.
George B. Barlow Arrested in Seattle
May Not Be Brought Here.
The arrest of George B. Barlow in Se
attle, Wash., Sunday has given considera
ble satisfaction to the police and the
Southern Pacific detectives here. Attor
ney Frank Kelly of the Southern Pa
cific called at police headquarters yester
day and notified Chief Lees that he had
the extradition papers ready and was
waiting for the Chief to detail an officer
to go to Seattle and bring Barlow back
here. It is thought, however, that he will
be prosecuted in Seattle by Mrs. Tennant
swearing out a warrant against him
then.
Barlow came with Mrs. Tennant from
Salt Lake to manage a ranch fur her in
Los Angeles County. On the train be
tween here and Sacrainehto he stole her
valisf, containing $1300 worth of Jewelry
and valuable papers, and absconded. The
Southern Pacific officials toofe charge of
the case and a warrant was procured
from Judge Mogan for Barlow's arrest
on the charge of grand larceny.
Every effort was made by the police
and Southern Pacific detectives to locate
Barlow without success, and Mrs. Ten
nant finally decided to r" personally on
his trail, and it has bei-n through her
perseverance that his arrest has been se
cured.
COMPETITION FOR
THE PACIFIC MAIL
KOSMOS LINE OF STEAMERS TO
COME UP THE COAST.
Lendal M. Gray, the General Agent,
in Town to Look Over the
Field.
Lendal M. Gray, genera] agent in Guate
mala of the Kosmoa lino of steamers, is
at the California. He came up on the Peru
Sunday.
Mr. Gray's business in the city is the |
long talked of competitive line up the
coast. He says it is coming, and he H
here now to look over the Held and pos
sibly to establish an agency.
The steamers of the Kosmos line run
between M< xlco, C< ntral America and the
weet coast of South America. They are
all comparatively new vessels, large, wcil
appointed and of good speed, and
are a sufficient number of them to
the company to extend the line without
delay.
"We are not fighting with the Pacific
Mail," said Mr. Cray yesterday. "We are
just looking around and finding out If
there is business enough for us here, it
is business we are after, and if we fin 1
there Is a chance for us in San Francisco
we will bring our steamers here. It i*
pretty certain, however, that we will be
here within a year.
"I came up only yesterday and have not j
so far had time to look annind. I will â 
bÂ«- here about ten days, and then I will
leave for Europe, but before i go I will
be able to say definitely whether or not
we will bring our line here."
So far as rates and rate wars were con
cerned, Mr. Cray would not venture any
information. His company, he repeated,
had no desire to work counter to the (Pa
cific Mall; it was looking for business and
would go after business when ver it might
t..- found. At first steamers will leave
here semi-monthly, but it Is hoped that
trips can be made more often after t!io
extension to this port has been estab
lished. The plans of the company are yet
Indefinite, however, nor will they be mi>re
certain until Mr. Cray has mad.- his re
i port to the home office of the line in li.-.m

Street Contractors Lose.
The City Improvement Company is
again loser in its action against William
Broderick as Auditor nf this city. Some ;
time nero the Supervisors save to the
company a onntrart to pave the city's i
portion of the street in front of Alamo i
square. When the work was done the !
bill was presented and ordered paid by
the Suprtf-vipnrs. but the Auditor refused
to audit the demand, on the ground that
the contract was illegal. The paying
company sought to enforce payment by
mandamus proceedings in the Superior
Court, but the Judge sustained a de
murrer to the action. An appeal was
taken to the higher court, which yester- i
day handed down a decision upholding '
the action of the lower court. The rea- i
son was that the Supervisors had vio- !
lated the law by giving out a contract 'â 
without advertising the work to be done,
and calling for competitive bids. These i
points are not now, having been decided
time and again.

The Matter Goes Over for a Week in
Order to Give the Accused Firms
a Chance to Explain
Themselves.
The award of contracts for furnishing
supplies to the Fire Department for the
ensuing two years lins been held up for
Â», week by the Board of Supervisors at
Supervisor Perrault in or
der that two flnns that received an un
merciful lashing by the Fire Department
Committee may have a chance to appear

j- The matter first came up in yester
day's meeting, when dork Russell read
D:.- committee's report of Its meeting last
Saturday, in which it was stated among
â  things tli.u the schedule embraced
â  i continued in part:
"It appeared that J. F. Wulzen bid upon

mends for the present, if required, these
supplies he purchased from wholesale

ferrauli moved to .--ink- oui all refer
: . Snook >v < o. and Dun
ham, Carrigan & hlayden. He thought
the c nsi the first two firms was
too severe to appear on the
i â  . ords.
Bymgton opposed the motion. Hr said
that ;i it wort; shown lhat those two
lirrus had entered into a combine to loot
the municipal treasury, the tact should
remain on record. Perrault's motion tin
ally prevailed; however, and that portion
oi the report quoted above was stricken
out. Later in tne session the matter came
up again, and Perraull and Byington bad
all animated discussion over it. The first
o: the successful bids way taken up for
ratification, but Perrault moved that all
bids tor furnishing supplies to the Fire
Department be laid over for one week in
oraer that Wulzen and Snook might have
â an opportunity to explain why they had
doubted up on the market price of cer
tain articles in their bids. The doctor
admitted that Snook was a friend of his,
and thin 11 the charges mad.- against
Snook were repeated in that gentleman's
presence the meeting <â : the board would
be transformed Into an imitation of a
boxing tournament of the National Club
Tile Mayor tried to gloss over the af
fair by calling Perrault attention to the
fact that the objectionable language had
already been stricken out of the commit
tee's report, but the doctor called atten
tion to Byington's statement in opposi
tion to the lirst motion.
"1 merely said that II those two firms
had combined to loot the treasury the
fact should remain of record," explained
Byington.
â¢'No, you didn't; you said they had
combined to loot the treasury," insisted
Perrault.
"Very well. then. If I made such a
statement I will stay with it," cooHy re- I
plied the other.
After some further discussion, Per
rauit'a motion prevailed, the members
thereby passing it up to Mr. Snook to
make good Dr. Perraulfs assertion that
he would afford some amusement to the
board if given an opportunity.
The scheme to pay something over
$25,000 for abstracts of titles to the prop- 1
erty in the park panhandle extension be- i
fore the people had even voted to issue

WELBURN COMES TO
THE BAR OF JUSTICE
LOUIS LOUPE TELLS OF A QUEER
PROCEEDING.
Nellie O'Brien Gives Strong Testi
mony Against the Defendant
for Withholding More Than
Half of Her Salary.
The Well. urn case dragged along in the
United States District Court yesterday.
The lirst witness was Burt M. Thomas.
special revenue agent. Mr. Thomas iden
tified the papers, etc., introduced in evi
dence and gave the jury an idea of the
routine of the Internal Revenue Collec
tor's office.
Louis Loupe, formerly chief deputy for
Collector Welburn, told how W. H. Dil
lard used to si^n W'clburn's name to re
ports and letters of tr.'i nsmissal. Dillard
could Imitate Welburn's signature so well
that the witness could not tell the X' jn
uine from the imitation. 'i lie witness
told about E. C. Akins being employed as
a dummy for Captain John E. xoung
berg. Witness said Akins received t'-o
per month, Foungberg drawing the sal
ary that should have been paid to Akins.
Dillard had the keys to the Collector's
office and desk. He also opened all of
Welburn's letters and attended to his pri
vate affairs.
Thomas Burns of the United States sub
treasury id. ntlfied a large number of
vouchers and checks tor salaries of
clerks, and said that Dillard had drawn
the money for most of them, Dillard haw
ing been recommended to him by Wei- I
burn as the official messenger for his of- ;
fice.
The most Interesting witness of the day
whs Miss Nellie 1". O'Brien. She was en
gaged by Welburn on February 'Jv lvo.
to work as a clerk in the office for $.'.v per
month. She was sworn In on the same
day and went to work on the next day,
j March l. Miss O'Brien was given vouch
] ers to sinn with the amounts blank.
They were introduced in evidence and
â  showed $129 for March. $123 for April and
$103 for May. She said she received only
$50 per month and was paid by Welburn
personally In currency.
The nath of office taken by the witness
was dated February 11 and her salary
for February, she asserted, was collected
by Welburn or Dillard, although she did I
not work in February, the 28th of that
| month being the lirst time she saw Wel
burn or was in the Appraiser's building.
She look the oath of office on Febru
arj 28.
The trial will be resumed at 10 o'clock .
' this morning.
MINISTERS' MEETINGS.
Interesting Papers Bead by Dr.
Stephens, Dr. Jones and Dr.
Adam.
Rev. John Stephens delivered an address
before the Methodist Episcopal Ministers'
'. Union at the weekly meeting yesterday
morning on "Kiblleal Criticism, Its Aims
i and Principles. He said the effort to
show through the critic Bible truths was
In itself a perfectly legitimate process and
'. -would ultimately give a clearer under
standing of the scriptures. He thought
I that criticism did not in any way affect
' the fact of revelation, but only the form
of it. Critics themselves, he said, do not
agree in their opinions and the tendency
is to return toward old traditions.
In the discussion which followed the
dissertation on the subject Dr. Locke said
jlt was time enough for the clergy to be
alarmed when the higher critics fell into
accord and became confreres. If the
Wble was true it could not be impaired by
those conscientiously seeking the truth.
: Dr. Goodwin said there was enough of the
i old good hook left after the siftings to
: save people. Rev. John A. B. Wilson
said he was not so much afraid of the
\ critics as he was of the defenders. He
illustrated his point by an apt story.
Bishop S. Garrison, publisher of the Lib
erator, was at the meeting and presented
a pamphlet to each minister, which con
tained a history of his experiences in spir
itualism.
At the Presbyterian ministers' weekly
meeting Rev. John R. Jones of Los An
geles gave a review of the new catechism
of the English free church, in .which he
undertook to show something: of its theo
logical value to the church generally.
Rev. B. J. Adam of Bombay addressed
the member? of the Congregational I'nion
by telling bis experiences in Bombay,
India.
WELLS IS WRATHFUL.
The Auditoi- and School Superintend
ent Have a Clash.
Auditor W<llw accuses Superintendent of
Schools Webster of props carelessness and
thr'.itens to expose him in his next an
nual report. Several weeks apo the Audi
tor pays he wrot<Â» to Mr. Webster request
ing him to furnish the average daily at
tendance at the public schools for the
present fiscal year In order that the Audi
tor might make his estimate on the ap
propriation for the next year. No atten
tion was paid to this communication, so a
Becond was sent, but Ptlll Mr. Webster re
mained silent. Yesterday morning Audi
tor Wells sent his chief deputy to make a
personal demand for the report. Accord
| ing to the deputy, Superintendent Web
ster stated that he sent letters to the
principals last Saturday asking them to
| send in the average daily atendance, but
had not received any reply. As tne scnools
! closed Friday and the principals are pre
i paring to jf" away, if they have not al
ready left town, the deputy remarked that
it was rather late to get the Information,
to which Mr. Webster is said to have re
plied that It made no difference any way.
When informed of Webster's statement
the Auditor sent him a letter censuring
him severely. The Auditor says he will
have to approximate the attendance, as
he lias only ten days in â which to get up
his estimate.
HEALTH BOARD FAILS
TO WIELD THE AX
EXPECTATIONS OF THE JOB
CHASERS ARE DEFERRED.
Another Meeting to Be Held Wednes
day Night, When a Clean-Up
Is Looked For.
The Board of Health met at noon yes
terday, hut contrary to the hopes and
expectations of the horde of job hunters
who filled the meeting room and slopped
over into the corridor, the ax was not
wielded. Mayor Phelan presided and Drs.
Coffey, Payne and Barbat answered to
rollcall. Dr. Keeney at present being out
of the city. i Captain Reddy, superintend
ent of the A'lmshouse, sent in a communi
cation stating that one female night
nurse and two night watchmen were an j
absolute necessity, and asking that thry j
be appointed. The application was placed
on file.
Secretary Dunne produced a formidable
bundle, which he announced were appli
cations for positions, and asked if he
should read them. The board ordered
them filed without reading. They were
from the following:
Mrs. Lizzie Karr to be matron of the
Receiving Hospital; Mrs. Rose Kane to i
be retained in that position; K. S. Pills- i
bury to be bacteriologist of the depart- j
I ment; Leonard White to lie driver of Gol- j
den Gate Park ambulance; P. F. Miatt to ;
be messenger; R. M. Clare to be engineer
at the City and County Hospital; N. Mc-
Laughlin "to be plumbing Inspector; Wil
liam J. Nelan to be an assistant; Â«1. \V.
Edwards to be a health inspector; Mrs.
1 Johanna F. Clarke to be Almshouse ma
tron, and Alfred ("Nobby") Clark to be
superintendent of that institution; Rob
ert Trewin to be steward at the Receiv
ing Hospital; Ml.ss Mary Pattun to be re
tained as chief nurse at the City and
County Hospital; Edward Neuman to be
chemist; Charles Jost Jr. to be a hialtli
Inspector, and O. L. Tuttle to be up
i pointed to a "suitable position."
Dr. Payne moved that the third Wed
nesday of each month at 8 p. m. be the
regular meeting time of the board. It
was adopted and the board adjourned to
next Wednesday night, when it is likely
that the patronage will be handed out.
It is report* d that E. A. Reddy will re
tain the superlntendency of the Alms- j
house. It is argued that his excellent re-
I cord would insure his reinstatement by i
the next board under the new charter a
few months hence, so it would not be
worth while to remove him.

ROBBED BY A
A SWINDLER IN
SAILOR`S GARB
Clever Scheme of a
Bunko Man.
AN ATTORNEY'S SURPRISE
WANTED TO MAKE HIS WIFE A
PRESENT.
He Purchases Six Yards of Supposed
Contraband Goods for Eighteen
Dollars and Finds He Is
Duped.
â¢ Attorney Becsey was cleverly swindled
out of $1S severa.l days ago by a smooth
confidence operator. Dressed in the garb
of a sailor the swindler visited Becsey's
office In the <ild Supreme Court building,
and after swearing him to secrecy un
folded a package containing six yards of
<ire?s goodsi He represented that the
goods were worth HO per yard and that
he had obtained them in a foreign port
and smuggled them into this city. He
bogged Becsey not to say anything about
how he had come Into possession of the
contraband goods, as' he feared that the
captain of the ship on which he is em
ployed might hear of it and turn him over
to the United States authorities.
Th< unsuspecting attorney, evidently
[ng his yarn, asked him how much
ild take for ili" stuff. The swindler
demanded $40. claiming that he had been
offered that amount by a saloon keeper
â with whom he had done business some
time ago.
Becitey, after admiring tho cloth and
thinking v. â¢ dress it would maki>
for his wife finally agreed to give the
"sailor" $]Â»> for It The swindler, after
hesitating for some time, accepted his
tloned the attorney not to
tell his better half from whom he had
1 ..it the stuff. After being handed the
amount the swindler lefi the office.
With the package under his arm and
vreathed In smiles, Becsey sur>-
Bequently appeared at the door of his
home arid was met by his anxious wife
"What i? in the package?" Inquired his
â  half, evidently divining that he had
esent for her.
"You couldn't guess in a hundred

hastily untied the string thai bound the
package and to her disgust she found that

When t"ld thai he had been swindled

Thinking thai he might return to his
law office expecting to present him with

Ira;, attorney went to police headquar

THE JAPANESE
TO BE TAUGHT
SEPARATELY
Legislature to Enact
the Required Law.
THEIR STATUS TO BE DEFINED
WESTERN ADDITION IMPROVE-
MENT CLUB TAKES ACTION.
Supervisors Will Be Asked to Light
Fillmore and Devisadero Streets,
as Provided by Municipal
Ordinance.
At the regular monthly meeting of the :
Western Addition Improvement Club held
last riicht in Franklin Hall the question
of the education of Japanese In public
schools was taken up, and chairman Dr. :
C. V. Cross was empowered to appoint a I
committee to draft a bill for presentation
to the next Legislature, placing the Jap-.
anese on the same footing as the Chinese.
The intention is to segregate the little :
brown men and provide a school for their
exclusive use. The law as now (â¢â¢insti
tuted applies to Chinese only, and it is
proposed to settle . inee and for all the
status of all Orientals who are educated
at the expense of the taxpayers.
In a communication to l>r. Cross Super- (
Intendent Webster holds that the Jap
anese must pay the statutory fee of $1"
pi r annum for a primary course. $2'> for
a grammar course and $.?0 to attend the j
high school. The law can only be evaded
by an American citizen becoming gyar
dian for the alien. The proposed law, i
however, will be regarded as the proper
solution of the problem, as there Is no !
particular desire to work any hardship on !
the Japanese, it is certain that they are
becoming so numerous that some steps
should be taken to prevent them crowding
out white pupils.
The fireworks committee of the Fourth
of July celebration notified the club that a
display Will be held OS the evening of the
4t li at Alta Plaza, bounded by Jackson, j
Clay, Bteiner and Scoti streets, for the j
benefit of Western Addition residents.
The light committee of the club reported I
that some definite action will be taken re- i
garding the lighting of Fillmore and ]
Devisadero streets, las provided by muni- j
clpal ordinance. Dr. Cross stated that he
had made personal observations and i
found -several useless* street lamps. He j
also found an electric-lighi pole on Clay
street, between Central avenue and Lyon
str.et. and three khs lamp? In tho same,
block. Only one house is located on the i
block. There is an electric lamp on the
southwest comer Of Page street and Ma
sonic avenue and a gas lamp on the north- j
west corner. On the south side of Califor- i
nia street, between Gough and Octavia. j
there is an electric lamp, while diagon
ally across, sixty feet away, there is a I
pas lamp and another one sixty feet west. '
<tn the corner of California and I.yoni
streets there is an electric lamp and two
useless gas lamps. None of these lamps
have fire alarm boxes. I>r. Cross is of the
opil ion that enough useless lamps could .
be cut out in various parts of the city and
utilized to light Killmore and Devisadero
streets, as required by the ordinance, and
the matter has been called to the atten- |
tion <>f the Board of Supervisors.

FOG SERVICE.
Weather Official McAdie Will Estab-
lish One.
Alexander McAdie, section official in
charge of the local Weather Bureau, has
established a fog service in connection
v.ith the other branches now in operation.
The new service contemplates the notifi
cation to the pilots In charge ol the ferry
boats Of the presence Of fogs outside the
Golden Gate and the possibility of its en
tering the harbor. Observations will be
taken as to whether the fog forms at the
bottom or whether It is the so-called
"high fop."
Fop is due generally to the descending
movement of the atmosphere and vapor
coming in contact with warm air on the
water surface. By taking the observations
on Mount Tamalpais and telephoning
them down to the local office the desired
information may be given out.
There was a peculiar change in the tem
perature yesterday. The thermometer
registered TA in San Francisco and 44 on
Mount Tamalpais. whilr on Sunday it
was 79 on the mountain and .'p2 in this
city, a practical reversal of the conditions.
This Is the first time :nat the temperature
hsa been taken at the sea level and one
ami a half miles above. According to Mr.
McAdie, "it is impossible to go west for
observations, but we can go up and put
both observations together."

PETROLEUM TANK EXPLODES
â Â« â
THE UNFORTUNATE VICTIM
WILL DIE.
: With Rare Fortitude He Assists the
Doctors in Applying Soothing
Oil to His Blackened
Body.
Charles F,. Holbrook. a teamster, was
; fatally burned last night by the ex-
I plosion of a tank containing crude pe
troleum at the works of the Union Oil
Company, on Kentucky street. Potrero.
The unfortunate man is employed by
; James D. Bocarde & Co., wholesale
draymen at fl Market street. He was
| sent to the works to get five drums of
petroleum and was to have taken them
to the Risdon Iron Works. After reach
i ins the works he noticed that one of the
I large tanks was overflowing' and he
I called the attention of the watchman
!to it. The latter, after explaining that
i he was dressed in his best suit ot
! clothes and did not want to take a
chance of spoiling them, asked Hol
brook if he would t..-t "stop off" the
supply. Holbrook readily consented.
and. taking the watchman's lantern,
; he repaired to the tank and after con
siderable trouble managed to find the
stopcock of the supply pipe.
The oil was pouring Into tho recep
tacle, and as Holbrook shut off the sup
ply he placed the lighted lantern along
side the tank. In some manner tho
flame from the lantern reached the oil
and a loud explosion Immediately fol
lowed.
Tho burning petroleum completely
enveloped the unfortunate teamster,
and with a wild cry <>( horror he started
to run from the scene. His clothing
I was a mass of flames, but with rare
presence of mind he attempted to tear
the burning rags from his body, all
i In vain, however.
Several men who were present has
tily divested themselves of their over
coats and wrapped them around the
body of the unfortunate man. After
| considerable difficulty they succeeded
in extinguishing the flames, but not
; until Holbrook was fatally burned.
The ambulance was at once sum
moned and Holbronk hastily removed
to the Receiving Hospital. An exami
nation disclosed scarcely a spot on his
body that had not been reached by
i the devouring flames. His back pre
i sented a sickening appearance, while
j charred and blackened pieces of flesh
| hung loosely from his arms and legs.
With rare fortitude Holbrook watch
-led Drs. Morrison and Pherwood ap
i ply a soothing mixture of oils to his
body. He assisted them in adjusting
the bandages that they tied around his
body, and occasionally gave them di
rections as to how he wanted the oil
â  applied.
"I guess there is no use kicking.
i boys," he remarked to one of the doc
tors as ho was placed upright on the
operating table, "I know I am up
against It."
After he had been placed in tho malo
ward the unfortunate man was visited
I by his employer, who instructed the
doctors to do all in their power to save
the ]jfo of the injured man.
He has been in tho employ of Bocarde
& Co. for several years, and is held in
high esteem by them.
The surgeons at tho hospital ontor
i tain no hope for the recovery of Hol
brook.

been out of work and out of money for
pome time past, and for the last few
dayshasbeen drinking heavily. T>ast night
shortly after 7 o'clock he went out into
the yard, presumably to water the flow
ers. As he did not return within a rea
sonable length of time his wife became
alarmed and made n search of the prem
ises. When she entered the cellar the
first thing she encountered was the life
less body of her husband hanging from a
beam.
McKenzie was 47 years of age and a na

often threatened to commit suicide during
days of despondency following a fruitless
search for employment. A widow and two
children survive him.

"PILLOWS" JEFF USED
TO ROCK FITZ TO SLEEP
THE boxing gloves Jim Jeffries
wore when he wrested the belt
from "Bob" Fitzsimmons have
been sent across the continent to
delight the eyes of the friends of thf
new champion In this city. Suspended
by narrow ribbons of red, white and
blue, they occupy the place of honor
in front of the center of the back bar
mirror in Al Smith's saloon at 221
Kills street. Beneath them hangs a
photograph of the young boiler maker
in fighting attitude. It is labeled.
"Our Champion." On the upper left
hand corner of the card upon which
it is mounted is a photo medallion of
Trainer "Billy" Delaney. A card on
the gloves bears the inscription:

J. <J. Jeffries
In His Contest With Bob Fitzsimmons
for the Chr mpionship of
the World.
These famous mitts -were taken
charge of immediately after the Wg
fight by "Billy" Delaney. The next

shipped them to his wife in Oakland.
They arrived there last Saturday
morning and that same afternoon Al
Smith, whoso confidence in Jeffries'
ability to "put it on" the ("ornishman

a telegram from Delaney. authorizing
him to get the gloves for display in

The gloves arc the finest grade five-ounce affairs called for by the provi

dried blood, and they do it. No one would suspect from a glance at the
mitts as they hang aloft that splotches of the good red blood of Fitzsim

journed to admire the mins.
One big stain on the knuckle of the left glove greatly resembled an out
line map nt Australia, two dozen flies on the outskirts making the coast
line. This sanguinary discoloration probably came from the active mouth of
Fitz. which, according to all accounts, bled continuously from Jewries' left
hand jabs.
Th.- only abrasion on either erlovp was a cut in the center of the hi<
blood spot on the left, as if the kid had come in contact with and hem cut
by Fitzsimmons 1 teeth. The right glove, which was placed so hard under
Fitzslmmons' heart and which finally found his jaw for keeps showed few
marks of wear.
The gloves will be turned over to Delaney when he arrives with Tef

the famous fights with which he has been connect* d.
These historic mittens were made by Sol Levinson of this city and sent

A committee inspected the course at El
Campo on Sunday last and decided that
the races should start from a point near
the steamer Ukiah landing stage, along
the Mann shore for more than three
fourths of a mile to the turn, and back to
the finishing line, the second leg of the
course being somewhat shorter than the
first. Some rows of piles which have hith
erto obstructed the course will be re
moved, thus enabling boats to hug the
shore more closely than heretofore
Smoother water will be gained and spec-'
tators will be able to get a clear view of
the whole race from a point just after the
start to the finish. , ,
The California Northwestern Railway
will provide transportation for actual con
testants and their boats. Oarsmen should
have their boats at the Tiburon ferry slip
next Saturday evening or not later than
9:30 on Sunday morning.
The referee and A. \V. Pape. were ap
pointed a committee to arrange the de
tails of the relay swimming race, which
will take place near the snore between
two floats fifty yards apart. Another
meeting of the regatta committee will be
held on Thursday night to settle the sta
.Uons to bo taken by, the, crews ia the ra
roost, reveals something of the mill
nous events. The races will start as soon
as possible after the arrival of the 10:30 a
m. boat from the city.
MUST NAME ANOTHER REFEREE
George Siler Cannot Come to the
Coast to Pass Upon the Ruhlin-
Kennedy Battle.
George Siler. who has acted as referee
in the last three battles for the boxing
championship of the world, will not offi
ciate at the forthcoming meeting of
Ruhlin and Kennedy. The chicagoan
promised "Billy" Madden, Ruhlin's man
ager, that he would make a pilgrimafc"
to the coast shortly after the Jef
fries-Fitzsimmons meeting. Immediately
after the fight, however, he secured a
position with one "f the big Kastern rac
ing- associations. He could not afford to
sacrifice this, hence another man must
be selected l>y Manager Collins of th'^
Excelsior Club.
Tmiti Snarkey and Phil Wand have been
mentioned for th" place. The naming of
a man will not be left until the night of
the light, as It is intended to avoid all
unnecessary delay.
Jim Franey, whose gameness captured
those in attendance at Woodward's Pa
vilion last Friday night, has been pn>m
ised a match with Tom Tracey. Jim Mc
â¢ irath has the most implicit faith in
Franey and thinks the setback he re
ceived last Friday will teach him to be
more cautious in the future.
NORTH END CITIZENS
WANT IMPROVEMENTS
ORGANIZE A CLUB WITH THAT
PURPOSE IN VIEW.
Enthusiastic Meeting at Which L. A.
Rea, James Bolan and John
Staude Speak.
AVith wild hurrahs and a stamping of
feet, a new improvement club was maiif
last night in the North End district of
the city. About 200 citizens gathered in
the New Washington Hall on Stockton
and Union streets to form the prelimi
nary plans of organization and in this
they were completely successful. After
two hours of speech making-, <he North
End Improvement club became a fact and
temporary officers were elected.
L. A. Rea set the ball rolling by a
statement of the purposes of the club.
He then called for a nomination of a
temporary chairman and was promptly
named for that position. The election
w.ms made without a dissentient voioe.
George Seekan was then elected tempor
ary secretary.
As temporary chairman and organizer.
I/. A. Rea spoke at length upon the ne
cessity for the existence of a well or
ganized improvement club in that dis
trict. He painted the lumpy condition
of the North End streets and dwelt
upon the indifference of the City Fathers
to act in their behalf. "With organiza
tion," he said, "we may hope for an im
provement in our section of the town.
The business man and the property owner
should come together and in a spirit of
unison work out the salvation of this
portion of the city."
James Bolan, at his own suggestion, as
cended the rostrum, expatiating upon the
needs of the North Knd from the civic
point of view. He spoke upon the ques
tion which has been agitating the Po
lice Department for some time, the seg
regation of the red-hued women in some
specially selected place, or their dissemi
nation throughout the length and breadth
of the city. He favored the former pro
ject For fear that the public might
think that this was a primal purpose of
the North End Improvement Club, Rea,
thp chairman, arose and poured oil over
the troubled waters.
John Staude was the last speaker, of
the evening, and he begged for a unity
of action, a combination of effort and
energetic work on the part of the busi
ness men and property owners of the
North End. The temporary chairman
was empowered to appoint a committee
upon whom the selection of permanent
organization would devolve. The roll was
signed and with the applications sent in
the North End Improvement dun n^v
numbers 300 members. The next meeting
will be held in the same place on Thurs
day evening.
